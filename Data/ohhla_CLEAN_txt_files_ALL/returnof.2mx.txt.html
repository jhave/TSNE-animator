Yeah!
2Mex clusive
Yeah
And a child shall lead them
And a child shall lead them
The return of Fernandomania

And a child shall lead them
And a child shall lead them
The return of Fernandomania

And a child shall lead them
And a child shall lead them
The return of Fernandomania

[Verse 1]
My name is 2Mex I'm not afraid of the cops I
just live, check to check and I stay hip-hop
I got a brand new CD that I know you don't got
I got my own fat section at the mom and pops
And I'm the - reason that your little brother's not a gangster
I'd like to take a little bit of time to just thank you
for buying imitations to weak toys
You've spawned a new nation of b-boys
The bling bling stuff was a mirage
I got your sister doing headspins in the garage
And you can pass the XO pass the Hennessy
Pass me the X-Clan and Public Enemy
The straight best from the underground West
You should buy a kid a book and not a bulletproof
Vest so if you're wondering why you should even try
+All Eyez+ are on me but I'm not +Ready to Die+

[Chorus]
So when you feel down like you don't belong
And you actually care about lyrics in a song
I got this brand new drug
And it's the bomb
Its called run back home and hug your mom

And a child shall lead them
And a child shall lead them
The return of Fernandomania

And a child shall lead them
And a child shall lead them
The return of Fernandomania

[Verse 2]
My name is 2Mex and I'm proud to be brown
In L.A. I got a ghetto pass I'm allowed to be down
I'm a walk into your town like a bum or a clown
As soon as I open my mouth you hear the lyrics sound
I'm a miracle elephant it' s not a miracle (?)
West coast underground hip-hop is relevant
So go ahead and dissolve in the illusion
I know this song won' t solve the resolution
You might catch me in an Escalade
But I don't make hip-hop to have sex and get paid

[Chorus]

And the chow shall feed them
And the chow shall feed them
The return of Fernandomania

And the chow shall feed them
And the chow shall feed them
The return of Fernandomania

And the chow shall feed them
And the chow shall feed them
The return of Fernandomania</pre>
