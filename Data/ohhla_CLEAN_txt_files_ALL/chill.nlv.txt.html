Verse One: {Lil' Ya}

It's that nigga of the block call me the hood mac
Down to make some snaps so what's the haps?
Do I need the strap? 
Will somebody give me a extra clip?
Cuz I'm a need it if these niggas try to trip
They might even try some of that funny shit
If they do, they fuckin' wig I'm a split
I'm a get my point across cuz I'm the boss
Walkin' with my mossed bird, double barrel sawed off pump
With some soldiers behind me called the Black Connection
Bet you bottom dollar we be tighter then some bird fly
You bests to run if you gun is on safety
Be handy with the steel if you ever try to face me
Nigga don't you miss because if you do I'm a retaliate
And before ya shut yo head and fuckin' face 
Don't get mad because yo tot your 'K' from the city
Lil' Ya fa'sho just call me the Frank Nitty
Takin' no pity leavin' yo city destroyed
Bustin' down yo door to take your coke and all yo boy
Then I leave the scenery my pockets full of greenery
Blood on my back and no more bullets in my mac
Watch yo back nigga

Chorus: {Tec-9/Yella Boy/Lil' Ya}

Parley is cool and ok
But I rather chill and hussle
I break it to them easy fit the pieces to the puzzle
Parley is cool and ok
But I rather chill and hussle
Nigga we got dem flippers for that ass
{2x}

Verse Two: {Yella Boy}

Like Black and Moe I got this shit sold
Cock diesel by my side another homicide
I'm back up on the scenery ya bitch you
I'm from the third U. N. L. V.  who the hell are you?
Now if you think you can beat me to the draw faw?
Try yo luck, because I'm a mover in the U-Haul
Yo ass in trouble, when I plot and get there on the double
Ain't nothin' shakin', when the real nigga hit the block
Fully auto amo aimin' at you non stop
Slickie Grease I got yo draws down
I'm pased once, I'm comin' back around to act a clown
No freakin' out because I'm used to this bloody streak
Everyday and all night I keep my heat
Don't give a fuck I play it real as it fuckin' go
I ain't no hoe I spin the bin lettin' bullets flow
Now can you coke with the gate like scope, nope
I ain't no joke see I'm straight downin' folks
I'm on the real with the bill fifty loc song
I put my stop to all you wanna bee's instantly
Then I vanish hangin' with the Spanish
I'm ducked off I'll be right back at you
I'm here to stay now bitch you like a statue
Ya see I'm dumpin' bullets if you try to disrespect my set
I beat I'll leave yo ass wet, because I'm in a affect
With the mag ninety, spittin' at you and yo crew
Comin' to down you, quickly try'na get rid of you
I catch a drain put yo ass in pain
Fuckin' with the Yella another unsolved slang
I come to buck you down because I'm a fuckin' clown
The black is in a position that it's supposed to be in
As I spin the bin once again 

Chorus: {2x}

Verse Three:{Tec-9}

Niggas I got that flipper bigger den the big dipper
We blowin' up slangin' this motherfuckin' gangsta shit
We be rockin' up slab have the money in my hood
Keep it good, protect the money that you make
You bitch niggas can't fade what we put together
No matter the weather I be ridin' around with 
That four-four in my leather 
Two extra clips to make sure yo bitch ass flips
So catch the cut 
Nigga what's happenin' with all that gafflin'
Get ready for strappin' because you know 
I'm bout that action daddy ok today
I take a ride with my AK 
Somebody don ratted out my rock shop
And told the cops my chillin' spot 
Where I hang at my Reservation
Jeopardizin' my probation 
But I got to hussle to keep my shit tight right?
If it means I have to walk the streets all
Motherfuckin' night all my hommies are out
Enjoyin' there selves (Where you at Tec-9)
I'm slangin' rocks in the motherfuckin' Meplh
Now let's elevate a take it to another level
Work it off the beeper flowin' from my nigga Keith
Use the code that I give you hit me I'm a hit you
Now picture me ballin' the emenies around me
Waitin' for me to go down 
Player hater's are created by the hour
Dope deal gone sour
Replace the yae with the flour
Break a quarter key down I can't fuck with that
Give a nigga ounce of that furl and I can fuck with that
I would love to go out and parley with my homies
Today but I got's to pay bills and tomorrow's the First man

Chorus: {2x}</pre>
