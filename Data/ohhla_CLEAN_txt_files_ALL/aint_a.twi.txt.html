Well there's gotta be a time when the bullshit stops
Ain't a damn thang changed still far from cops
It's been a long time comin' and believe we came
If fans only knew that ain't a damn thang changed
Hey yo fuck moneybacks, cadillacs
Nice clothes, studios, hot wax, fine hoes
Freestyles, drug sales, competition, videos, and Duck Tales fresh
As fuck means of consignment
All about realignment to the game
Hometown hero, was treated like a zero
Hate me more than ever cause now I got dinero
In my enemies eyes I stand alone
Blowin' in the wind just me and my microphone
I'm like a Jedi Knight bringin' the force and the light
Mean muggin' muthafuckas like I'm Andre the Giant
Type of shit that start a riot, but I just begun
Explosion C4, 3, 2, I'm 1 (Bang!)
Heads are bound to get cracked
Beefs kickin' out equivalent to get whiplash
Add a dash of ridalin just to keep me sane
But the problem goes deeper than the cells in my brain
Maintain for the simple fact I stack my wealth
Because I can't help nobody till I help myself

Well there's gotta be a time when the bullshit stops
Ain't a damn thang changed still far from cops
It's been a long time comin' and believe we came
If fans only knew that ain't a damn thang changed

Monoxide Child hey, wicked wild
Nicotine, and THC be my style
Profile of a serial killa that's who I be
The T W I Z T I D
I'm comin' with the shit to make your head explode
Cock the hammer in my mouth, and let my tongue unload
Road to riches, taggin' bitches
Fuck around I'll have you sleepin' with the fishes
Fuck is you in stitches
You can hate me and my no good friends
But thinkin' this shit gonna end, is all pretend
Now lend me an ear, and I'ma scream it loud and clear
It ain't safe for you to hang around here
7 Mile in the hood, East side, chinese eyes when we ride
Shit ain't even close to changed around this
You the one actin' like a lil' bitch
I don't know what you heard, or what you thought
Or who you with, or who you brought
Bitch niggas get tossed, whut?
That's right ain't a damn thang changed, but day to night
And you ain't on the mic
Like to recite my shit, kindly to your bitch
So both of y'all can suck a dick

Well there's gotta be a time when the bullshit stops
Ain't a damn thang changed still far from cops
It's been a long time comin' and believe we came
If fans only knew that ain't a damn thang changed
Well there's gotta be a time when the bullshit stops
Ain't a damn thang changed still far from cops
It's been a long time comin' and believe we came
If fans only knew that ain't a damn thang changed
Well there's gotta be a time when the bullshit stops
Ain't a damn thang changed still far from cops
It's been a long time comin' and believe we came
If fans only knew that ain't a damn thang changed
Well there's gotta be a time when the bullshit stops
Ain't a damn thang changed still far from cops
It's been a long time comin' and believe we came
If fans only knew that ain't a damn thang changed
Changed, and ain't a damn thang changed
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody,
nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody changed
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody,
nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody changed
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody,
nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody changed
Yeah, nobody changed bitch
Twiztid juggalos, that's how we do it on the East side
Crank that shit
And we out bitch, and we out bitch, and we out bitch
Yo Monoxide crank that shit</pre>
