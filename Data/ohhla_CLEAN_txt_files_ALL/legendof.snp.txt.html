[RBX]
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Just then, I received a phone call, it was Morpheus
And he said i was the one, ha realizing the deal Heaven done
Turnin' to the east and all praise the sun
Now they blast me but they all miss
I do my 3D dance and remain undaunted
Then simply reverse the process
As the hot slugs hit their chest-plate, checkmate
Game over, you lose
Funky, drunken monkey technique without screws
As the sayin' goes, if ya snooze ya loose
And I won't be aimin' when the oozy ooze
Got em' runnin' for the hills
Style steady truckin' like eighteen wheels
Do got em' cluckin' like eighteen pills
The hex flies off then all the blood spills

[Snoop Dogg]
The Legend of Jimmy Bones
Sharp as nails, tough as stones
This ain't based on no true story
This the real motherfucker

[RBX]
Carry vocal tones, most definitely will
Cause more horror than Amityville
Get out, this my house
Got you scared niggas don't chew like a church mouse
When I swing the excalibur like Highlander
The head flies off you see thunder and lightening
Too much, too late to recognize your blunder
Suddenly you hear there can only be one, well just X
We apply wild west tactics like turn back-to-back
Take ten paces and draw, but I'm sneaky with mine
Turn around at nine and blast you in your spine
High-ride off into the hot sunset
Like the high plains drifter
Hear me mister, no one blast with the
When it comes to shootin' gives up
X marks the spot and guaranteed to lift up

[Snoop Dogg]
Payback is a dog and revenge is sweet
Murder is the cold that Jimmy lays on these wicked ass streets

[Snoop Dogg]
I cut cha' head off, go ahead get cha' lead off, set it off
Motherfucker bit his leg off
I want revenge, this shit's gon' end
You thought I was gone, motherfucker I'm back home
Jimmy Bones, it's on so ain't no stoppin' this
I'll take you to the Necropolis
And place you in the front, remain calm through tis damn thang
Listen here man
Killin' after killin' dealin' after dealin'
You motherfuckers don't really know how I'm feelin'
But I can't waste time and reflect on that
I gotta get these niggas who stabbed me in my back
Jeremiah, loop a bitch and aid mack
You turn my peoples out on the crack sack
7-9, remember that, way back
But Karma came back, now you motherfuckers have to deal with that

[Snoop Dogg]
What goes around, comes around
Do unto other, as you would want them to do unto you
It's a dog eats dog world

[MC Ren]
Nigga fuck that, my black ass back from the grave
Fucked up is how we behave
Where the fuck you think you runnin' to
Everywhere ya bitch ass turn, I'm in front of you
Motherfuckers wanna scream but they choke
Pissin' on they self when I raise at they throat
Grab yo bitch that suck dick while I smoke
Then hang yo bitch using tape and rope
Go on motherfucker take two to the head
Don't give a fuck, villain already dead, already bled
List of names
All on they ass, nigga fuck these games
Here to cause pain
Can't back a bitch, when niggas gotta beg
Not to be filled up with lead
Time for me to fuck her, there villain get the fuck out
Leave you stuck out, leave yo fuckin' eyes plugged out

[Ricky Harris (excerpt from the movie "Bones")]
Jimmy Bones, is that you?  We killed you motherfucker
and buried yo' ass with nothin but yo bitch's bloody rags
Now I can count the holes in yo motherfucking chest [* Gunshots *]

It's out, out, out
Jimmy bones
It's out, out, out
Jimmy Bones
