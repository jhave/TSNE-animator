(Verse 1)
I don't think I'm the last-I'm the only one of my breed
because I'm unable to trust-unless it's one of my seeds
even still I fall in love with the women who give me nothin'but drama
too busy lookin for what I'm missin'my mama
keep God first is written on every autograph I sign
but hard to practice what I preach,with all this evil on my mind
'Cause my premeditation is revenge
not patient enough to wait on God to handle it for me-I come and sin
you wonder why I never come around
'Cause if I'm goin thru it and we're together you might get a lil'down
and I'm not tryna be a party-pooper
even though I'm rich-I'm use to bein depressed,I'm addicted and just can't quit
Truth is my situation ain't live
my label just paid for lawyers and the advances,and a Chyrsler to drive
you wonder why I'm still holdin'this microphone
but let the people know that live a life like mine,know that they're not alone
 
[Chorus Repeat 2x]
Truth is-everybody love to talk about what's wrong wit'somebody else
but I'm not scared,to say what's wrong with myself
Truth is-I know I rap about the same thing,again and again
but show me money,happiness,and real-true friends
 
(Verse 2)
Lately I been thinkin'about Rhonda and I miss her
but I don't miss my could-be wife I miss my sister
I saw you on the news and I'm sorry for ya loss
another baby daddy dead and one more kid around the house(damn)
I made I hate you bitch about you and you know that
but check this out...sometimes I be wishin'I could go back
and undo it,never go thru it-try to keep on livin'our lives
all I can say today is I apologize
even though you did me bad-I ain't mad,cause we both did dirt
but you didn't have to steal from me and make it hurt
told the laws that I hit you(bitch)-tryed to send me to jail
then called my phone,screamin you loved me and I loved you as well
but after that wasn't nothin'left accept to let my wheels spin
now everytime I meet a good woman-I'm afraid to let her in
'cause I don't wanna repeat 2003
I know you mad,but if you and the kids every need anything-holla at me
 
[Chorus Repeat 2x]
Truth is-everybody love to talk about what's wrong wit'somebody else
but I'm not scared,to say what's wrong with myself
Truth is-I know I rap about the same thing,again and again
but show me money,happiness,and real-true friends
 
(Verse 3)
I'd rather walk alone,instead of walkin'20 deep
I'm a shepard,but I know I can't handle too many sheep
some say I'm a prophet,some say I'm just tryna earn a profit
but if I'm tryna walk right-the Lord gon'keep somethin in my pocket
I curse and I smoke weed and keep a gun in my hand
but I never said I was perfect,I am only a man
I been to jail a couple of times but that don't mean I'm a threat
In fact the Lord was probably protectin'me from my death
'cause I done had so many beef-with other rappers and police
and gangbangers that claim what I claim wanna see me Rest In Peace
bury me next to my mama if they lay me down to sleep
Truth is I'm not a person,I'm just another CD
Man I done tripped out on some of my fans,indirectly
so many haters had me thinkin'all of ya'll was tryna disrespect me
sometimes I wish I was somebody else
but thank the Lord for all of my troubles-cause that's what makes me myself
 
[Chorus Repeat 2x]
Truth is-everybody love to talk about what's wrong wit'somebody else
but I'm not scared,to say what's wrong with myself
Truth is-I know I rap about the same thing,again and again
but show me money,happiness,and real-true friends</pre>
