[Verse One: Uncle Murda]
OH!!! Damn! If I aint the hottest
Then that mean there ain't no more roaches in the projects (PICTURE THAT!)
And man, If I ain't the realest
Then the cops who killed Sean Bell ain't no killers (You know they crooked)
I'm good for listenin while lettin my tek pop
If I ain't hit ya in the head I gave ya a neck shot (BANG)
And whoever I get on the track with
Better go hard and not spit no wack shit (GO HARD)
I'll put ya sixteen in the dirt
Just to get to my part, dudes will fast forward your verse
When your dead you just die you don't feel shit (YOU DON'T)
Rest in peace to homeboy I'm fuckin his bitch (I AM)
I'm lookin for a papi to front me them bricks (PAPI)
When it's bam back time I ain't up for no shit (I DON'T GOT IT)
He told his connect how I played him
He lucky I ain't pulled out that Kay and slayed him (AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!)

[Chorus: Sample Courtesy of Kanye West "Can't Tell Me Nothin"] (Mistah FAB)
'Cause after all of the drama, 'cause after all of the drama
'cause after all of the drama, Kay Slayed 'em
Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em, Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em
'Cause after all of the drama, 'cause after all of the drama
'cause after all of the drama, Kay Slayed 'em
Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em, Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em (Mistah FAB)

[Verse Two: Mistah FAB]
Cause after all of the drama still a piranha
Hated like Osama but loved like Obama
Raised by my mama in projects, pissy hallways
Gunshots they all day death seen it in broad day
Crackheads are wise but they don't use they wisdom
Rich people thinkin they riches, they can take it with them
Peep the prism that I give them my science, help build on them
In the days of swag rap, reveal skill on 'em
Park benches in neighborhoods I still chill on 'em
Knuckleheads get out of line, we pull the steel on 'em
Can't steal on 'em cause niggas they takin faves
You have to kill a nigga cause niggas ain't gettin played
Raised in the hood by the hoodlums, and ruffians
Niggas that didn't used to do nothin now they shootin men
Church boys turned to turf boys, it's the worst boy 
Mama cryin in tears, her son on the shirt boy

[Chorus: Sample Courtesy of Kanye West "Can't Tell Me Nothin"]
'Cause after all of the drama, 'cause after all of the drama
'cause after all of the drama, Kay Slayed 'em
Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em, Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em
'Cause after all of the drama, 'cause after all of the drama
'cause after all of the drama, Kay Slayed 'em
Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em, Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em

[Verse Three: Grafh]
UH! Cause after all of the drama Kay slayed 'em
I StreetSweeped them I AK'd 'em
Bread ain't breakin a safe haven, I ate steak while they ate bacon
They fake they are Clay Aiken
Me and Kay Slay payed day in
Have your brain on the wall like one of Kay Slay's spray paintings
How you made they made day in I rep Jamaica Queens
Like the E, and the F and the J train station
Whoever try and play, they racin up the highway to heaven 
Try to take Satan on vacation (Amen)
I hate hatin (Huh) I whip it whip it while I'm flake bakin
I put a grip up in the Playstation (Nice)
This is niggarific (Huh) This is dedication (Yes)
This you gotta sniff it (Sniff) This is medication (Oh)
When this get in your system (Huh) This is penetratin
It gets you wicked or when your ventilatin.....BREATHE

[Chorus: Sample Courtesy of Kanye West "Can't Tell Me Nothin"]
'Cause after all of the drama, 'cause after all of the drama
