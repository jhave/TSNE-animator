(I keep it)	( *echo* )
(I keep it) ( *echo* )
(I keep it)	( *echo* )
(I keep it) ( *echo* )
(I keep it real like that)		--&gt; Mad Skillz

[ CHORUS ]
To all you Lo-sportin, herb-puffin niggas pumpin jacks
(I keep it real like that)
To all you chickenhead brothers that's posin and can't rap
(I keep it real like that)
To all the project heads gettin g's in fat stacks
(I keep it real like that)
Paula Perry represent Brooklyn like that

[ VERSE 1: Paula Perry ]
I gets harder than a penis strokin, pokin, I got you open
Wet you up like some pussy that's soaken moist
Hear my voice, you got no choice
But to lay low on the cut, nigga what?
Fuck around and get that ass Bucked like Shot
My peeps up top be handlin, got it locked like a key hole
Herbin niggas like Deebo
Every Friday you'll see it my way
Drivin down the highway in my Land Cruiser
Thumbs down to all you losers
Blinded by my rims as it spins (spins)
Paula Perry here I come again settin trends (trends)
You ain't got no wins (wins)
You could never reach the level
Of this rap rebel
Queen of treble and bass
I bring the shit to yo face
(Nigga)

(I keep it)	( *echo* )
(I keep it) ( *echo* )
(I keep it real like that)		--&gt; Mad Skillz

To all you Lo-sportin, herb-puffin niggas pumpin jacks
(I keep it real like that)
To all the project heads gettin g's in fat stacks

[ VERSE 2: Paula Perry ]
Pulverizin MC's into smithereens
When you step into the realms of the Queen of Fort Greene
Bitches be on that nag 'n all
Frontin like they packin ammunition
As soon as it get real they get missiin
My click is thicker than the dick of a stick-figured nigga
Hipper-than-an-opotamus, follow miss
All up and down Myrtle Ave.
See, I got soldiers that'll tear the frame out yo ass
Comin from all directions and sections
Wipin shit out like wet ones
Fulton ( ? ), so all you cornballs get ready
Carvin through crews, just call me Paula Machete
And you Confetti, MC's I'm tossin
Gettin rid of you like an abortion
So take precaution 
(Nigga)

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Paula Perry ]
All of you egotistical lyrical individuals
That think you're criminal material
You never pulled a heist in your life
You straight sheist in your life
My whole crew is livin trife
Yo style, I wouldn't say it's versatile
Cause you been slippiin somebody else's lyrics all the while
That's foul, don't got no skills and get you filled
You wanna battle? I'll eat that ass up like a meal
Herb you, I'll subvert you, serve you
My corniest rhymes'll have you cryin
And you'll be nailed like a cuticle
Your rhymes ain't suitable
Enough, or rough enough like a rider
Basically I dream of riches, you dream of bein me
I dream I'm ill, you're never seein me
No doubt, that shit is out, boo
Don't even waste your time, kid
(Don't even waste your time, kid)
