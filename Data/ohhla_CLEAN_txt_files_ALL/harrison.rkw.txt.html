[Intro: Raekwon]
I really don't need to be fuckin wit ya right now
I need to movin around in the air, circle Manhattan
Real smooth

[Raekwon]
Here we go again son, black Harrison Ford on the run
One, beef in the field, it's real
Highly recommend shield, Lee rocks, still he rock
Got the blue lazer, grill, like Martin Scorcese-ah
Jumpin outta limo's, expos, black rentals
Chasin niggas through the projects, polex
Mosien, 15 of us, five trucks
Crazy deluxe, found what, honor nigga right
Tailin us in boats and land, 40 calibur in my hand
Made the left... Lex fam
Sho enough what, hummer craft lookin up, what
Kid the chipped out flex now I'm stuck
Bounced on him, public announcements say they want him
Any ideas? Where he at, cops want him
Changin the gear the same foot wear
Runnin like a crook, yea, no love here
Fuck yea, we up there
Had a little drugs there, they was there
Pass it kid, Novacain caught a slug there
Had it mastered in fleis-school, nigga go whip a plane
Drivin land, map shit out, go to night school
Bronze star, feelin who we are
Half animal, whole lotta love, black God
Standin front and center, from here to winter
Grip the splinter, shoot it sideways, nozzle on, pip-it
Ready to hit somethin, pop shit wit somethin
Blow blimps on the mad rubber grips, big lips on it
Rollin wit top rank medals, hands is like Greg Neddles
Bright link, purple heart, swim bezzle
Hearin the horn of Josh, movin like the moss
Executive decision play large
Caught a blimp on the radar, screen him out
Fightin like like Julio Cazar, blaze ya
May day, may day, chasin me, CIA, KGB, FBI, DIA on they way
Trynna chase down the God, this Afro-African'll lace ya

[instrumental breakdown]

[Raekwon]
Part two kid, establish brain power, true did
Yo it's realer than a fuck now, ain't stupid
Trash, three hundred thousand in cash, guerilla mash
Brass this gat, TNT niggas on my ass
Play for real, Lex will, I suggest still
Clear my own shit, let the press ill, let's bill
Make it to the UN, doin bout a thousand in the blue Em
Frogmen, repped out cluein
Left all the American Express cards
Left the passports, time shit, shit up on in Escort
Bail 'em, bustin his joint, Chief O'Heara
That old, Louis McDarren, see the waves through the mirror
Spot that, hop that, through the top back
Ready to lock somethin, down for the cause, stop that
You play the king, I play the pawn, who the king of the Swarm
You wrong, where's the evidence, watch the firearm
Where a tunnel of fans stand, I knew I had little bits of love
Hopin it'll be fair, he watch me, heavy roxy scene
He clean though, American Cream Team let him leave
See the moral of the story, feelin me like
Mordon and Glory when they came for me
Had fifty on the line, look at mine, all dressed down
Handlin lines, know the time</pre>
