Song:   Studio Lovin'
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Girl let me take you to my studio
Give you everything you want and need
Lay you flat like a piano
If you let me stroke your keys
You going be saying things you never said
Matter fact you going be playing melodies you never played
We aint' in no bed
We in the lab
And I'm reclining in my seat
You can just climb on top of me and ride me like this beat
You say you need this (loving)
Well imma grab your wasteline
And if you like it deep
I could hit you with that baseline
I aint' tryin to waste time
For me and your sake
Plus I'm payin for this session
I need more than one take
I make the boards shake like how I'm suppose to
I'll have you sounding good
Lil ma, I got them pro tunes
Now you in the mood
I got you doing this and tryin that
Beating in your drum
While I'm playing with your high hat
You like that
Soo you dont want to, I just make you do it
Got you in love, cuz when we fuck its like we making music, go n' lose it

[Chorus]
I don't want to be unusual
But there's a lot of things that I can see me doing to you.
Up in my studio oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, ohhhh yeeaaa.
You say you probably work tomorrow, you can make it though
And even thought there's probably other places we can go
We in my studio, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, ohhhh yeeaaa

And no, it aint gonn stop
I keep this song on replay
Puttin all them scratches on my back
I'm like go dj
Be my guitar
I'll pluck your g-string
Pull it to the side
Imma make them vocals drop
I'm gripin on your thighs
We tangled like some cables
From the front look in your eyes
Then I turn you like some pables
No you fiendin for this (loving)
That's what you gonn get
And I cant sing,but I see you
And know I'm gonn hit,yeaa
Lets do the verses now
Worry about the beat later
Heard you be going off that head
You dont need paper
Play you an e-major, a-minor
Girl your rythym straight
And I say you got great timing
Feel your heart rate climbing
Like when my speakers quake
More than a qruayer straight
You got that 8-o-a
You say you cant
But I do something that just make you do it
Me and you dont fuck
We make music, yeaa

[Chorus]
I don't want to be unusual
But there's a lot of things that I can see me doing to you.
Up in my studio oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, ohhhh yeeaaa.
You say you probably work tomorrow, you can make it though
And even thought there's probably other places we can go
We in my studio, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, ohhhh yeeaaa</pre>
