The simplest shit aint plain to see 
Chaos floods the life on these streets 
Took a wrong turn on burned concrete 
And now the enemy dies for free 
Real young guns are kept firing 
And the clowns that are holding it down are smiling 
We kill our own and bring sirens 
And act out the ultimate plans of fighting 
  
Chaos serves as smoke repeated hoax to screen 
We lose control confused in the midst of staged scenes 
Media invented unrelented reports presented 
Often enough to make us think our worlds tormented 
Sentenced by the momentous news of feuds we side and choose 
Use weapons and step in the trap we lose 
Pick up wars designed to scar and kill ours 
All because the broadcast flashed ghetto stars 
How much television you watch you tube whores? 
Keep score and wake up or theyll do it some more 
  
Crazy times and wild headlines 
Document the city routine with hard rhymes 
Blinded street teams clash 
And push our message across the news flash 
Baldheads are sick minded 
And anyone who crosses the path is found dead 
Through TV set nonsense 
We sit and fit as the face of violence 
  
(CHORUS)
We roam the streets all lost 
And get caught up in a world of chaos 
Survive or defeat concrete jungle 
Ex-out the weak order out of wild streets 
We roam the streets all lost 
And get caught up in a world of chaos 
Survive or defeat concrete jungle 
Ex-out the weak order out of wild streets 
  
They keep order by making street corners gang borders 
Beating down king and setting the theme for riot starters 
Cop quarters cant maintain the disorder 
So they call the National Guard to come strike harder 
Rolling deep headed for Florence and Normandy where all you see 
Building on fire chaos on Roman streets 
Hope is cheap sold by the local thief relief from the common grief 
Served on a platter shatter your smallest dreams 
Pig chiefs are referees on gladiator fields 
Were too busy dodging the sword truth stays unrevealed 
Sealed all filled in the federal cabinets 
Classified order through chaos for world inhabitants 
Can you survive these real hard times? 
Wild confrontations of mine, well, alright 
We go to the streets at night 
And fight in the sick-ass side show of mine 
We play the government role 
And straight up fuckin smoke the rival 
We plan you will fall 
And leave you wasted on arrival 
  
CHORUS (x1)
