I get money, I-I get money
I-I get, I get, I get, I get

I get money, money is got
(Ah, ah, I get it)
I-I get money, money is got
(Ah, ah, I get it)
I-I get money, money is got
(Ah, ah, I get it)
I get money, money is got, money-money is got
(Yeeeeeah, I run New York)
I get money, money is got
(Ah, ah, I get it)
I-I get money, money is got
(Ah, ah, I get it)
I-I get money, money is got, money-money is got
(Ah, ah, I get it, yeeeeeah, I run New York)

The bank don't stop 'cause they put me in cuffs
Still made money up in the can, what the fuck
I'd have a babe by you baby, if you a billionaire
Write the check before I cum, just sign right here
I'm gon' stay rich
I ain't gon' die tryin' to spend my shit
I'ma die tryna spend your shit
Nowadays these rap niggas on some feminine shit
So I guess Queen Bee gon' be the man of this shit
Laughin' at these rap bitches on some amatuer shit
They better off makin' a livin' on some janitor shit
Who the hell is this chick? She been out kinda long
Had one hot song, I'm sorry I missed it
Too busy being +Conceited+, puttin' on my lipstick
Takin' trips out in Cali, chillin' with the Hiltons
Yeeeeeah, I'm chillin', Kim top billin'
With the top down, trowin' money through the ceilin'
I get it, the lifestyle that you only rap about
I live it, my man buy cars that you hoes be rentin'
I'm classy like a Phatom, you a Honda Civic
Lil' Kim got your whole bank stopped, I get it

I-I get money, money is got
I-I get money, money is got
I get money, money is got, money-money is got</pre>
