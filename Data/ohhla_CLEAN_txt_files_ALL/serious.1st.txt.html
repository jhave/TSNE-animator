Gangsta, yeah nigga you know (you know)
Yeah.. that's right yeah this for all my Mobb niggas right here
You know(gangsta shit! nigga gangsta shit!) The whole family
This our shit right here, this our new anthem man
Yo...

Broke niggas everywhere
Man I die to see 'em all thun I just don't care
My niggas droppin' dead all around me yo
I stop goin to them wakes a few bodies ago
My man just came home and just like that
They hit again with murder he never coming back
Turn on my TV just for more bad news
Little shorty got him a gun and shot his school
Can't even breathe cause the air so polluted
Got to wrap myself up in the sheets because of them roaches
The H-I-V the A-I-D-S
The only safe sex is to not have sex
We be sniffing, smoking or drinking that shit
Or poppin them P's or shooting up IV
The modern-day slave trade, they blew up the World Trade
Like out with the old in with the new world way

[Verse 2]
New York, New York, The Empire State
I live hell nigga this the belly of the beast
I step foot out the crib, no shit
Gotta bring that hammer cause the drama don't quit
Everybody want to be king, they ain't fit

Look how I disrespect their team, cause they ain't shit
They got good talk, but that's about as far as it go
When it's time for that murder...they don't show
When it's time for that fighting niggas is ghost
All you hear is straight crickets, niggas is bitches
I learn you niggas how to handle your business
That's word to everything I love and God my witness
Bring that shit, I'll show you how to work them millimeters
Bet my heater will smoke like reefer
All I wanna do is get my money and re-up
Take a steps to all sovereignly for my freedom
Not trying to get caught up in global court
Fucked up trying to fight the case by global laws
Out in the Netherlands I got a better plan
I murder the powers and let Chuck fight them

M-O-B-B-D-E-E-P - Man

Don't make me have to body some(thing) (niggas is crazy man...word man)
