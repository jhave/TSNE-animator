[Chorus]
I'm a (monster)
Yeah, yeah, I'm a monster
Yeah, I'm a monster
Yeah, I'm the little monster

Yeah I do backpack rap, I got money in my backpack
Underground rapper making money with these rap tracks
Rap cash, I'm no dummy you can laugh at
Backpack, ain't nobody bummy in my rap class

[Verse 1]
I'm a killer, a gorilla, little King Kong
Breathing fire, Godzilla, everything's wrong
Madchild's on tour, crushing every city
I'm on some real life shit, nothing's ever pretty
Fuck a mainstream rapper, that's my hash tag
Chop him into pieces and I stuff him in a trash bag
Wish that I could say that I was living lavish laughing
All that I can say is I will give a savage thrashing
And you don't want to fuck with Mad cause I'm a martyr
Battleaxe Warrior and this is fucking Sparta
Crazy fucking cannibal, I'm not the one to laugh at
Innovator with the generator in my backpack
Viper with the mic, I'm hyperventilating daily
Psychos with the rifle and a knife, this shit is daily
Haoles in Hawaii smash your heads with ukuleles
Crazy Irish monsters that will bash you with shillelaghs

[Chorus]
I'm a (monster)
Yeah, yeah, I'm a monster
Yeah, I'm a monster
Yeah, I'm the little monster

I do backpack rap, I got money in my backpack
Underground rapper making money with these rap tracks
Rap cash, I'm no dummy you can laugh at
Backpack, ain't nobody bummy in my rap class

Backpack, I got money in my backpack
Underground rapper making money with these rap tracks
Rap cash, I'm no dummy you can laugh at
Backpack, ain't nobody bummy in my rap class

[Verse 2]
Yo it's a distorted portrait of assorted moral warping
Morphing from a corporate orphan to a fucking headless horseman
Acrobatic jack o' lantern firing like a spaceman
Wearing Bathing Ape but I'm on Planet of the Apes, damn
I'm fucking hungry, got a high metabolism
Mannerism of an angry man that's doing vandalism
Wish that I could say my life's entirety fantastic
But my environment is still like Ironman on acid
When I was doing dope was a lying a little bastard
But now I'm back a dragon breathing fire on my master
I'm a monster, I drink a can of Monster which give me magic powers
Then I do a fucking concert (monster)
Inebriated Libra, I am not what you expected
Abbreviated breathing through a deviated septum
I don't rap for media with beady little pupils
I rap for deviants that do graffiti in their group homes

[Chorus]
I'm a (monster)
Yeah, yeah, I'm a monster
Yeah, I'm a monster
Yeah, I'm the little monster

I do backpack rap, I got money in my backpack
Underground rapper, I make money off these rap tracks
Rap cash, I'm no dummy you can laugh at
Backpack, ain't nobody bummy in my rap class

Backpack, I got money in my backpack
Underground rapper making money off these rap tracks
Rap cash, I'm no dummy you can laugh at
Backpack, ain't nobody bummy in my rap class</pre>
