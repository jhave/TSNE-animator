[Intro]
Geah (geah)
GEAH~!
Geah, yeahhhh
Yeahhhhhh

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We pull up to the club, fresh up off the grind
Me and my lil' buddies and we fin' to jump the line
Jump the line e'ry time, you know we jump the line
Fresh up off the grind and we fin' to jump the line

[Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane is my name, Gucci's what they call me
Six months I lost it, now I'm back to ballin
Twenty-eight inches got me standin really tall man
Tearin up the mall, this is just the way I ball man
Cocaine ounces, blue and yellow wristband
Chain look Iceland, watch by Breitling
Niggaz think ice game, Gucci think island
Niggaz thank Charger, Gucci think 'rrari
Sorry, Murcielago, I park it
Inside peanut butter outside chocolate
Now outside, get it inside ice ceam
Diamonds look mustard, S-600

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I'm headed to the club, I'm lookin for a gul
She lookin for a thug like I'm lookin for a plug
A quarter pound of pound, I sold a lot of drugs
I got a lot of slugs, see I really got it up
But I ain't got enough, I'm steady re'in up
I'm blackin out, my auntie house, she said she's had enough
She put at the house, and I'm back in the trap
It made me feel real good when I came back with that sack

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I'm South Beach in Miami, red and white Ferrari
Off-set shinin rims on my oh-seven Aston Martin
Baby got a jaguar but I like Ferarri
Watch by Jacob but my shoes are made by Marlin
Stepped on your boyfriend and didn't say sorry
Looky looky looky, here comes Gucci
Stepped on your boyfriend and didn't say sorry
Looky looky looky, here comes Gucci nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
