[Intro]
I'm ridin slow, I'm ridin slow
Millzie!
I'm ridin slow, I'm ridin slow
Yo, yo
Light it
I'm ridin slow, I'm ridin slow
Let me get Louie gang bang for this one baby
I'm ridin slow
Check me out

[Verse 1]
Money on my mind, so much money on my mind
This brilliant brain of mine probly printed with dollar signs
And please don't compare these other suckers lines to mine
Cause I'm killin my whole class. Forgive me Columbine
Line from the bottom of the gutta
My steerin wheel leather, my pistol grip rubber
No detective but I'm probly up in New York undercover
On some molly with some dotties, you're telling her that I love her
Rolling like Gunplay up in this motherfucker
And we all bout that Gunplay up in this motherfucker
My team like none other, my weed funny color
Harlem hustler cop coupes and tear the roof off like Busta
Til they rup me in my grave I'm screamin death to all suckas
You's niggaz ain't been through shit
I've dealted tougher than my mother
Burned down, so much loud
It's like my address is the clouds
Ridin slow, creepin on a comeup bitch, bone style

[Chorus]
I'm ridin slow, ridin slow
I'm ridin slow, ridin slow
My system hot, my cap low
I'm ridin slow, ridin slow
I'm ridin slow, ridin slow
My car kushed out, watch it flow (watch me flow)
I'm ridin slow (I'm ridin slow)
Slow, slow
I'm ridin slow (I'm ridin slow)
Slow, slow
I'm ridin slow (I'm ridin slow)
Slow, slow
My car kushed out, watch it flow (watch me flow)

[Verse 2]
Money on my mind, so much money on my mind
This brilliant brain of mine probly printed with dollar signs
I done seen hustlers burn bread, get wrapped, turn fed
Lil niggaz get popped not knowing, it ain't they turn yet
Speedy doing too much, get screwed up
This loaded black powder, lay yo ass down
Dead presidents  make that
Don't ever mistake that
True love  you can't break that
Get rode on, race tracks
Nigga fix yo brake pads
Don't worry where Jae at
I'm Harlem like A Fav
Ride and bumpin ASAP
Split the dutch ASAP
Roll that up ASAP
My barrel bout that audit ah
You don't wanna face that
Yo girl jumped in my car late
Laid on my kids and where her face at?
Boy I'm killin shit, here's the evidence, where yo trace at?
RIP PRP's, her match dope with waist at
I know first place is near the mountain top, I could taste that

[Chorus]
I'm ridin slow, ridin slow
I'm ridin slow, ridin slow
My system hot, my cap low
I'm ridin slow, ridin slow
I'm ridin slow, ridin slow
My car kushed out, watch it flow (watch me flow)
I'm ridin slow (I'm ridin slow)
Slow, slow
I'm ridin slow (I'm ridin slow)
Slow, slow
I'm ridin slow (I'm ridin slow)
Slow, slow
My car kushed out, watch it flow (watch me flow)
I'm ridin slow, ridin slow

[Outro]
Smoke something bitch
Smoke something
Smoke something bitch
Smoke something</pre>
