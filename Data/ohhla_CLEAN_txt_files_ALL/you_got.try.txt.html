(Nature Boy)
The life I live is so beautiful
And exquisite so everybody wanna live it
They choose the lifestyle for the glamour
And for the dreams of making cream like a freelancer
Without considering what its about how maintaining 
How I keep my bank account from draining
So many niggas want to take my place
The feds want a case
Who can I trust on this paper chase
They got my partner in the precinct making deals
Thought he was real, we been snuffing snakes for years
Came to me wired up the feds got me tied up
Facing so much time I can't buy it up
Made bond now I'm on the run
Can't get no worse since the case though
They say you hot son
Finally captured and offered life from the start
Give up your boss or tote your cross
You got tha heart?

Chorus:  2x
A lot of niggas want to join the click
Cause we rich
They never think about what we do to keep this shit
When the feds prosecute you as a street guard
What you gone do?
You got tha heart?

(Nature Boy)
It's after midnight
You coming home from the boss
Your car phone rings obscene phone call
Now you greeted by a strange voice
Squeeze your steering wheel
Great feel knock you off course
The desperate voice say I got your son
With his pretty face taped to the barrel of my shotgun
Whether he lives or dies that's up to you
I need a million cash fast what you gone do
Tell you what, have your butt home in and out
Prove your power or show your son you's a coward
And watch him die after I molest him
Teach you a lesson that'll keep your ass from flexin'
You call the cops your son drops
Your little boy will be sent to death by his own pops
Now what you think they got your ass in the path
And your boy dead, if you ain't got tha heart

Chorus:  2x
A lot of niggas want to join the click
Cause we rich
They never think about what we do to keep this shit
When dirty niggas catch you slippin and pull your card
What you gone do?
You got tha heart?

(Nature Boy)
I got a call from a watcher says its going down
We checking ground clean up and get out of town
Remember those 5 tricks who robbed the click
And cops found 3 dead in the trunk of precious' shit
He finna snitch this shit bout to hit the fan
I just left the can I can't go back man
So what you gone do, chill let me think this through
Round up the click and meet me at the shack quick
Where Precious at? On his way to the precinct
We got to hit him or its life in the clench
Lets move quickly before interrogation starts
And peel his cap before he tells the facts
I grab my vest two nines and hit the floor
Asked God for protection and hit the door
I reached the crew and said listen up from the start
We killing cops and all you got tha heart?

A lot of niggas want to join the click
Cause we rich
They never think about what we do to keep this shit
When its time to kill a cop and stay on top
What you gone do?
You got tha heart?
A lot of niggas want to join the click
Cause we rich
They never think about what we do to keep this shit
When dirty niggas catch you slipping and pull your
card
What you gone do?
You got tha heart?
A lot of niggas want to join the click
Cause we rich
They never think about what we do to keep this shit
When the feds prosecute you as a street guard
What you gone do?
You got tha heart?</pre>
