I used to love her, too bad I had to put a slug through her
Dumped her body in the trash like I never knew her
Blood runnin down the gutter into the sewer
Her body stunk for weeks like horse manure
Now the police are looking for the boyfriend, I'm the suspect
Forensic files, evidence, panic through public
Domestic abuse, custody battles
Bitch made me go crazy, I had to stab her
Plus I didnt like her ex-boyfriend anyway
She never knew today would be her last day
When she came over, I gave her a rose
Then slit her throat and watch her shake untill her eyes close

[Chorus]
I didn't mean to, I fucked up again
I made a mistake and killed my ex-girlfriend
I didn't mean to, I fucked up again
I made a mistake and killed my ex-girlfriend

[Esham]
Man this bitch wasn't innocent, she was guilty by far
Found a used jimmy hat in my car
And she had told me she was going to her mothers, well..
She can tell it to the Devil in Hell
I waited for the bitch to get off work the next night
Slapped her in the back of the head with a pipe
Bitch fell to the floor, bleedin out of her nose
I need a handsaw, a few garbage bags, and a hose
It wasnt premeditated, it was preaggravated
You think I wanted to cut this bitch up, man? I hate it
Man, why she do me like this, when I brought this bitch chocolates too?
Well fuck, she's through, what are you gonna do?

[Chorus]

[Esham]
No hellos just goodbyes
You know why she had to die? Cause she's a liar
Chopped her up and threw her in the bonfire
But I kept her head with the transcripts read
Your honor, I didnt kill this bitch, her family just want to see me buried
Cause me and her didnt get married
Is that necessary?
Instead, I chopped her up and carried her head around in a bag
With a fourty-four mag
Hailie's crying for her mommy
He didn't commit suicide, I killed your cousin, Ronnie
Trying to stay up out the county
But how can I do that with all these shady cops around me?
