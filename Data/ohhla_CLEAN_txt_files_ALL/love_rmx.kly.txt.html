Uh, uh, uh
So So Def
Crossed us, nigga, you know, not
So So Def
It's a full time get dope spot
Full time blow spot, we ain't gon' stop
Keepin' the flow locked
Keepin' the flow locked, yeah, yeah
C'mon

[Kelly Price] (JD)
I got a secret in my heart
And baby, it's tearin' me apart (Yeah)
Cuz I want the world to understand
That I love you and you are my man (Uh huh)
Baby, we know that we belong
A love that is real just can't be wrong
Can't keep it inside for very long
This love is too strong
So, when you're not here, I got (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got a secret that I want you to know, baby (C'mon)

1-	I can't hide what I'm feelin' inside
	Boy, it's killing me, baby
	So, why can't they see that I...
	I can't hide what I'm feelin' inside
	Everyone should know
	So, just let it show, baby

Boy, I feel it's time to let it go (Uh huh)
You stayed on the hush, we can't belong (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But I need to let my feelings show
I can't take it no more
So, when you're not here, I got (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got a secret that I want you to know, baby (Haha, c'mon)

Repeat 1
[JD]
Uh, huh, y'all wanna dance?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Here we go

[Kelly Price] (JD)
I'm yours (Say what)
I'm yours, I'm yours
I belong to you
You're mine
Your world, should be mine
You belong to me (Uh huh)
Why can't they see?
Why can't they see it's killing me?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cuz I can keep a secret

[Da Brat]
Uh, ah, c'mon
I must release this, we can't keep it a secret
Fuck a hush-hush, need you in my life to complete it (Yeah)
Cuz ain't nobody like us together, let's grow old together
We never both do whatever we want, believe it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When you get mad or heated, I want the world to see it
When you happy, my purpose never defeated
You got me walking around helpless with no hope
I'm high off you, selfish, with my dough
Love to picture a vision of me and you
It will never be another lover like
Ooh, ooh, LaShawn
Make noise with your homeboys (Yeah)
Say, they knowin' how we been keepin' it quiet long enough
When I feel inside strong enough to bust
Open up the hard, the hardest thug
Hop on his wood when he need love, can't hide
They see me shine when I ride this (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's blow quiet reminds just you and I boy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Repeat 1 to end

[JD]

Y'all know how we do it over here, huh
Y'all know how we do it over here, huh
Y'all know how we do it over here, huh
C'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
