Yeah
Studio rap productions (this is how we ride)
Uh (and this is how we ride, seventh sign)

[Verse 1]
My seventh sign niggaz still in that thang a dang
Knelt down come around my way
That's how we monster mash
Sip that crown all day everyday
Hey, hey and then I'll be pay-e-yayd
Fresh out of them carcus mountains
Fountain of youth viking the future and truth
The revolution of runaway slave don't stop 'til the execution
I'm rappin, workin for my people don't beg for no restitution
Bizzy be khaki'd up baby dust a mink
You gotta love me cuase I'm ghetto fabulous
What do you think, half breed rock the mic
Seven don't rock no pig I'm giving the people what they like
I've heard of murder but I don't know nothing
Like 'ternal clink, sink
I ain't had a drink in four motherfuckin weeks
I'm gonna go split my dome, what do you think
You better believe it

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid to die
And I'm not afraid to fight, and we can
Bang, bang all day (all day), all night (all night)
All night (all night), this is how we ride
This is how we ride
And I'm not afraid to die, and I'm not afraid to fight
So we can bang, bang all day (all day)
All night (all night, all night) this is how we ride
This is how we ride, (this is how we ride)

[Verse 2]
Puerto Ricans call me papi cholo stop drop
Pop in the blunt black mafioso
Bullets be rellellen through you fucks
Gotta a cop coppin a co-co
The block is hotter than lava
My nigga dial it this is devotion, holla
One of thee broke heart rapper
Your hatred is gasoline my words are vitamin mena
You need to shut your mouth and mind your manners
Gettin high since I was nine
Dead homies, I could still smell pine
And wether I twist my tongue or not
Little Bizzy still gonna shine
So re-lax your mind and let your conscience be free
And get down to murderous music from me
Check out my new thang please
Don't let 'em rap they whack
Don't know how to move thangs, pack
Or playin in stadiums, third markets
I threw thangs back
And I'm the rebel that made it rappin 'bout crack
Read many books to elevate my levels
So the words would match I am the fresh batch
Bakery, seasons veteran kesh
Now let me ride, gotta thank God just for saving a wretch
So y'all come on

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid to die
And I'm not afraid to fight, and we can
Bang, bang all day (all day), all night (all night)
All night (all night), this is how we ride
This is how we ride
And I'm not afraid to die, and I'm not afraid to fight
So we can bang, bang all day (all day)
All night (all night, all night) and this is how we ride
This is how we ride, (this is how we ride)

[Verse 3]
Bizzy ain't never made no honor roll
Dope dealin and dropped out
Got addicted to money can't stop it
This is what it's all about
Drunk, yellin "Geronimo" here foo
Seven is jumpin with me black limo window tinted
Roll it down let 'em smell that sticky
This Bizzy the Kid let the prescense come
Graze your city I refuse to go back to funerals
Niggaz be dying to quickly
Cause the knuckle heads get buckled
I know they comin to get me in my life
Like I'm blackula only the lights been with me
Here we go into the king elected by the people
I gotta grip on things I'm watching evil
You know my steez plus believe that I'm gone with it
From dusk to dawn you could ask the matradi
Bizzy got that Filet Mignon
I don't need no empathy play the track
As I control the symphony
Gotta get my monopoly property of that nigga Bizzy
Thought he was hard and got his jaw brought
Bitch I can pass out, get up, start rappin and have it all locked

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid to die
And I'm not afraid to fight, and we can
Bang, bang all day (all day), all night (all night)
All night (all night), this is how we ride
This is how we ride
And I'm not afraid to die, and I'm not afraid to fight
So we can bang, bang all day (all day)
All night (all night, all night) this is how we ride
This is how we ride, (this is how we ride)</pre>
