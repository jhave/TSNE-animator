Sinister Voices

[Verse One - Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Moves you cant trace 
Terror face-to-face
I lace the bass and drums with nuff taste
When its crunch time, I invite MCs to my lunch time 
With a punch line, bake beef like a mongoose
Even if its one line, and do rhyme 
I track em all down, waste a few rounds
Clownass niggaz get shot like grave robbahz
Get around like my ballahz
In the coup the (?), no time to chill
Sun too hot to stop
See the world through a blink of an eye, imagine dat
I weight cannabis cats steadly takin' naps
Perhaps, I fuck up ya dome like Pete Snaps
No fake cats I need to procede with mine
So long I step on the stage I spit fire
I'm da natty, definatly living up the party
I shut the fuckahz down if these niggas dont respect me
Make em shake like epelepsy
Cant stress me
Cant test me with that talk ya talk keep it walkin'
I walk mine till the end of time, connecting 
Collaborating with my comrades from everywhere
True is how I keep it secret: I never leak it 
Hot like bahama beaches, with ya girl eating peaches
Shadeeqy lace the track like lee gee (?)
Hiphop's a fine whole (?) lotta way she freak me

[Chorus - Mr.Eon]
We come elevated
Untranslated
Uncut, MCs get done up when we run up
Run up, my fake poets, throw ya love up 
Locally, globally wreckin' totally
We come elevated
Untranslated
Uncut, MCs get done up when we run up
Run up, my fake poets, throw ya love up
Locally globally wreckin' totally

[Verse Two - Reservoir Doggs]
Momma always said there'd be days like diz
I'd be stressed like diz, and fall victim to the streets 
At an early age have my peeps call early graves
In the early days like around the late 80s
When chicks around the waist had no tits but had babies
My crew went crazy, drug money made us lazy
I never wanted to work, just sell this rap drug
To fiends everywhere with their headphones plugged
Verbal injectah
Hold the gadget like Inspectah
12 bars or pressure
Ghetto story lecture
Indiano, aka C-malo, a hard act to follow
Nigga chew before ya swollow

[Verse Three - Reservoir Doggs]
Yo yo yo yo, 
Get ya best lined up, get ready so we can combat
I stomp that, blow bags and flow tracks
Where the do at, bless a nigga format(?) packs
Like gats by the ass crack when I click niggaz past that
They make lyricis, I blast back with a phat rap
I back trakcs, u relapse, I pack stacks, u eat that
Shit you talkin' new york bronx state of (?)
Double bread niggaz who shine get blind of the realness
Yo feel diz
Got my cake stacked up,  and blaze shorty with the sex 
Got my games backed up, I bought a half a million worth of ice
Keep it confidential, presidential on a rolex
go tex with the lex as we flex this
General who da federal
Interlectual 40 more with the residue dirty dogs
B-X we bless like the hands of Christ
And roll dice triple 7 for eternal life

[Verse Four - Joe Sexx]
My infra-red sizing you up, you live what nigga what 
Promote and curruptness, or necceary ruptness
When I bliss, hiss the fist with (?) clips
(?) up those tips between lips and shit
Now and dat shitez
Force and I dont cries smash da dice
The cubes I hold I wrote, see low?? twice
Shakin' up the standard turnin' scramblahz to cant handle us
I want it all be to be, a bad (?) gambler
Shacked ya girl as angela?? got her on camera-rush
And when my mom sees how I'm mashin' or flashin' it from da door-step
Ya niggaz aint vile, ya gotta disscuss the wild
Fuckin' slim girls the project's gotta pee now
Meanwhile niggaz be fucking my guns keep bustin'
Chicken heads keep fussin' 
Ya bitches always want to suck
My .45 is cussing cops is coming but I aint runnin'
Joe Sex lets get added motherfuckahz

[Chorus - Mr.Eon]
We come elevated
Untranslated
Uncut, MCs get done up when we run up
Run up, my fake poets, throw ya love up
Locally, globally wreckin' totally
We come elevated
Untranslated
Uncut, MCs get done up when we run up
Run up, my fake poets, throw ya love up
Locally globally wreckin' totally
