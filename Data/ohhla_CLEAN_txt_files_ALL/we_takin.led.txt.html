We the best
We takin' over
Listennn!

[T.I.]
Ay, ay
Started in Atlanta, then I spread out wit' it
South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi
On to North Carolina, Phildelphia and Virginia
From down in Miami where it warm in the winter
On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter
Jackson then Tallahassee, Memphis, Tenn. holla at me
Me in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland daddy
I'm the man out in Dallas, better ask Khaled
Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Blowin' and spinnin', goin' down Bennett
Drop six-fo', three-wheel then switch it
Red light stop, make it drop for the bitches
Got a glock fo'-fifth, blow your head off wit' it
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it
King got the crown then sped off it wit' it
Say you need bricks, I said I get it

[Akon]
If you want to, we can supply you
Got enough work, to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you, unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground
'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time

[Rick Ross]
Triple C, Black Flag
We rich, yeah

[Khaled]
Listennn!

[Rick Ross]
Boss, it's what I does
I get money everyday, everyday I does
That Benz, is how I ride
Black flag on the left, two hoes and ride
You better, move! Ak all day
Get shot up like Shyne, that's on my niece
I'm +B.I.G.+ like Diddy
Damn it, I'm wit' it
Khaled we did it, Biggie of my city
Please no fitted, fuck it, I'm too pretty
The (?) can get (?), stupid, I'm silly
Money that come, runnin' like water
Mami so hot, damn it, she gorgeous
Miami on fire, you better be, cautious
Might get shot on the porch of your fortress
Now they see that you know I'm from Port City
I run in 'cause Rick Ross is boss shit

[Akon]
'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time

[Fat Joe]
Cribs Mania
Khaled!
BX, TS nigga

[Khaled]
Listennn!

[Fat Joe]
Blat, when you see Crack, better duck
like the mac gotta ease past, nigga what
Shit, I don't give fuck, I run these streets
Y'all talk that shit, I want that beef
I'ma tell you like a g told me
They'll come back quick if a nigga O.D
Cash Rule Everything Around Me
I'm YSL, Versace
You could see me in that Porsche GT
Comin' down Sunset, sittin' on D's
Feelin' like 'Pac, All Eyez On Me
Fresh bandana and I'm blowin' mad trees
Nigga please, I spit crack every verse a ki
Some say Khaled, some say Colli
Twelve years down and I'm finally free, crack!

[Akon]
If you want to, we can supply you
Got enough work, to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you, unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground
'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time

[Khaled]
Listennn!

[Birdman]
Birdman daddy, I'm number one
Nigga came at me wrong so we got him done
Fuckin' with the fam', I'ma give him son
Spent that co'ner, he didn't run
Sunday had a whole church singin' a song
"Why'd they have to send my baby home?"
Fuckin' with some nigga, that paper long
Been a g in the game now my son on the throne

[Lil Wayne]
I am the beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
I am untamed, I need a leash
I am insane, I need a shrink
I love brain, I need a leech
Why complain on easy streets?
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak
and I like, my Sprite Easter pink
And my wrist special par but the Mula's cooler
I have more jewels than your jeweler
Touch and I will bust, your medulla
That's a bullethole, it is not a tumor
Red light, red light, stop your rumors
I stay on track like a box of Pumas
Now just r-r-rock with Junior
I am the little big Kahuna, y'dig?
