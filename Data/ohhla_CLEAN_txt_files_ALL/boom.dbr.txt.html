[Intro]
Boom! Oh Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Boom! Oh Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Boom! Oh Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Boom! Oh Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Fuck me, Fuck me, Fuck me, Fuck me

[Chorus]
Boom! I fucked your boyfriend
I fucked your man
Boom! I fucked your boyfriend
I fucked your man
Boom! I fucked your man
Bitch! I fucked your man
Boom! I fucked your boyfriend
And I'd do it again

[Verse 1]
When I first saw your man we was really fine
And you was getting a little irritated that I was looking
Like you knew what was on my mind (fuck you)
You're not secure
It's written all over your face
You thought it wouldn't last (not tomorrow)
Top kitty in place
You see me as an obstacle
Staying away much as possible
It's mandatory that I command the attention of your man eye
Not to mention he can't help it because I'm fly
The plan is
I stroll by
Big bubble Chanel shades with diamond tips
Get up close and personal
Seduce with my lips
I ain't gotta say shit
He felling me and you all bent outta shape
Cuz I'm about to take who you with
Keep crunk
The run in my blood make a nigga jump jump
His body was banging
His teeth was pearly white
He had those strong keen features like Mario Van Peebles
His check bones was chiseled
His smile made me sizzle
His cologne had me sniffen' him from all the way home
I wanna smell this nigga and I this nigga to smell me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
So the night went on
We keep it in each other sides
He kept coming around me just to see my behind
I was being so flirtatious with the body language
I was so anxious to make those arrangements
Tangle him up in the sheets
Transaction about to happen anytime that we meet
I put one foot in front of the other
Stopped to look in back of my nameplate in the mirror
Gotta make sure my lipstick is straight and not smeared
Its clear he wants me severely
So I slide over up to his ear and whispered it gently
Fuck Me! Fuck Me! Fuck Me!
You on the other hand nowhere to be found
Told you he was going to pee
But he came to find me
He felt you standing around
I'm a fuck him

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You came to the bathroom
And guess what you saw
You saw my big brown titties popping outta my bra
With his mouth on my nipple like a suction cup
I was wrapped around him like an octopus
He was rubbing me down so I couldn't get up
I know you hate me now but I don't give a fuck
If he was yours like you said he was
His dick wouldn't have got so hard when I gave him is first hook
Ever since then he be loving on me diligently
Being all I need a nigga to be
He got me crawling the walls
I never been so quick to come up outta my drawers

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You damn motherfucking right
I fucked that nigga
And I'm a fuck him again
Over and over again
Diligently bitch!
You know why I fucks with him and he fucks with me
Cuz I'm fly
Don't me mad that I caught you man's eye
It's the B to R-A-T once again from Chi
And it ain't no lie cuz I fucked him
I fucked your man
Shit bitch we more than friends</pre>
