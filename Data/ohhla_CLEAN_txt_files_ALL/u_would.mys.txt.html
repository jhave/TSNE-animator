I had thought i heard u laughin, talkin trash
Bitch, whats happenin
Start shit but dont take it
Pull it out, put it on your ass
Some of y'all niggaz still got the game fucked up this year
But I ain't gonna have it
Tryna talk about anotha muthafucka on a record
And the bitch aint got no cabbage
Hopin somebody can tell me whats wrong with this picture
Dont think you can put out whateva you want
And I aint gonna come back in the bitch and come getcha
Imma find out where ya hang at
Where ya old lady live and what time you be there
Go scope out ya ride
Follow ya to work and bring that heat
Duck and whooo! from this fuckin fool
Monkey see, monkey do nigga
So you cant be the man right chea too
Theres none afta this
Not anotha livin M.C. as hazardous
And as talented and handsome, ghetto fabulous
Keep em off my back
Wheneva they comin I bring that double
In a minute y'all niggaz dont show no love
Its gonna be trouble
These niggaz here get ya name bent
Washed up anybody yall sent
Gotta watch these niggaz, they get outta line
I put em in they place every time they nut up
Gotta stop em from spreadin them lies
Bust em in they mouth and make em shut up
Get up! Come here!
Neva seen me cut up, ya must not be from here
Im four and none here
Dont have me to bring up the shit I've done here
Reach blazin temperatures
So please come wit ya sun gear
Whoop the sleeves off of muthafuckas that try to run in here
Serious look on my face
And a boot in my mouth and balled up fists
These niggaz dont want my trouble
But its too late for em, gotta accept this shit

Chorus:
(Tryna sound like me)
U would if U could nigga
U would if U could
(Tryna be like me)
U would if U could nigga
U would if U could nigga
(You wanna do what I do?)
U would if U could nigga
U would if U could nigga
(You wanna take my style?)
U would if U could nigga
U would, but U cant, so U aint!

From the moment that i slid in the door
They know I'm back cuz you can hear it in the floor
But afta I rap bitches aint feelin it nomore
Wanna talk that shit, betta kno what to come with
If you jump in the water
Then ya ass betta throw up before i start ballin
And if you eva fuck with what I be recording
Imma flush you down the toilet
And if you eva come at me wrong with a mike
Imma throw you in the gutter
I cant be scared these niggaz 
And they disrespect me cuz im from New Orleans
We dont play that shit
When these niggaz and they really want me to get started
Make it painful cuz I dont think so
I be bustin til I cant
Thats what I where that tank for
Hittin with the speed of Roy Jones Jr. 
And the strength of Iron Mike Tyson
Triflin, exciting, well precise
And I gotta let em know that I still been right
You talk on me strong
Just cuz I'm rich dont mean that it dont sound hungry
Count if you wanna
Hope you think cuz you little I wont jump on ya
You betta remember that 
When you be droppin that bullshit
You lucky I'm in a good mood right now
But I'm lettin you know how it could get
If I was the preacher
Yall niggaz would run when I step off the pulpit
If I was you I'd leave me alone
Cuz bitch I aint nothin to fool with
But if it is on ya mind 
You got somethin to prove, then go head and do it
I get so vivid
I wouldnt be able to make a better picture if I could
You understand my platinum
Then fuck up my raps, semi tracks 
No matter wheter kickin a verse or smokin a sack
I'll fuck over you, yea
I'm makin a habit of hurtin they head and bustin they ass
Fuckin they woman and takin they spotlight, makin em mad

Chorus &amp; talking til fade</pre>
