[Intro: Teyana Taylor]
See me in the club with my bottles up
Tell the bartender he ain't got enough
See me in the club with them models huh
Rock with me now

[Jadakiss]
I'm a hit 'em hard, J to the *MUAH*
No weed on me, left the joints in the car
Cardigan Herme skully with the scarf
You could just look at him and tell that he a boss
Order what you sip on, Louis Vuitton slip-ons
If you can't stay in the race you get skipped on
over for this smooth shit, time for improvement
Elegant wrist wear, Turbian movement
Yeah - it's twelve bottles to a table
Gamblin wit'cha life, playin lotto wit'cha label
You always in the red but they object is to pay you
Then you wonder why I'm in the projects with the llello
Shrimp's in the music, accordin to how you use it
But when you get addicted to somethin, you abuse it
Yeah - we gon' drink 'til the sunlight
You listen here, I don't do it unless it's done right
WHAT~?!

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor] + (Jadakiss)
See me in the club with my bottles up (you see me)
Tell the bartender he ain't got enough (reload me)
See me in the club with them models huh (hey lovely, ha)
Rock with me now
(Right now I'm in my prime) rock with me now
(I've always been ahead of my time) so rock with me now
(I ain't here to tell you no lies) rock with me now
(I'm top five dead or alive) rock with me now

[Jadakiss]
Yeah - I'm gettin money ain't nuttin new
Nah, you should see they face when I'm comin through
Hah, bunch of weirdos lookin corny
Started off with blue jeans and I took it to Barney's
Keep your girl over there if you notice she horny
Should have left her in the crib if you know that she on me
Bars is Polish Spring, the flow is Dasani
Purple label, that's why you ain't notice the phony
Ha ha! You see the difference in the stones
Forty cal kick back different when it's chrome
And now I react a little different cause I'm grown
Sour come out when the piff is all gone
Stay given them hell, keep heaven with me
I seen the game wear the rim out, that's a trip B
Comin down 7th in a new 750
And all I do is pray that the feds never get me
What~?!

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
