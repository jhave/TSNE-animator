Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Candy and dreams are your favourite ones
Is that really what you want?
'Cause I got what you want in my pocket
Hand me the keys I'll hand you the sun
Is that really what you need?
'Cause I got what you need in my rocket

(5) Babies in lines to pick from
(4) Yeap, and I'm wondering, which one
(3) number moves best to the kick drum
(2) Kick me to the moon it's this one (1)

[Verse 1]
One, two, three, feet and rising
There were five I wanted to plug one
Hey the day in L.A.'s got so what's night in Alabama do you want some son?
So, what's a 20 minute flight pulling your boots like Napoleon Dynamite
We worked up but we worked biting appetite
Looking at Earth from my personal satellite
Got it right, they got left. Going up, take a breath
It's a giant leap for all mankind
But for us it's just a simple step, baby step

[Chorus]
Candy and dreams are your favourite ones
Is that really what you want?
'Cause I got what you want in my pocket
Hand me the keys I'll hand you the sun
Is that really what you need?
'Cause I got what you need in my rocket

(5) Babies and lines you've pick from
(4) Yeap, and I'm wondering, which one
(3) number who's best to the kick drum
(2) Kick me to the moon it's this one (1)

[Verse 2]
People in cars go vroom
Speeding to the dope go wroom wroom
Let's go half on a tank
If you got some fuel then I got that boom (boom)
Crank my truck I'm still a country boy PBR's in a cup
You wanna see inside the Astronaut farmer
5 4 3 2 1... buckle up

[Chorus]
Candy and dreams are your favourite ones
Is that really what you want?
'Cause I got what you want in my pocket
Hand me the keys I'll hand you the sun
Is that really what you need?
'Cause I got what you need in my rocket

(5) Babies in lines to pick from
(4) Yeap, and I'm wondering, which one
(3) number moves best to the kick drum
(2) Kick me to the moon it's this one (1)

[Verse 3]
Damn, she's got the ground control
I'm looking at the sky where should we go to
Na-na-na-Night
Lights in the club don't shine like that tha-tha- that's gotta be your back
You almost gave me a heart attack
You must to put somethin in my Cognac
I'm kind a like an Alabama headache at
Myspace game will now be maxed
And if you wanna know where I'll be at
The ships are fat with..

[Chorus]
Candy and dreams are your favourite ones
Is that really what you want?
'Cause I got what you want in my pocket
Hand me the keys I'll hand you the sun
Is that really what you need?
'Cause I got what you need in my rocket

(5) Babies in lines to pick from
(4) Yeap, and I'm wondering, which one
(3) number moves best to the kick drum
(2) Kick me to the moon it's this one (1)</pre>
