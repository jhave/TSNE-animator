(Pras)
Yeah, uh, yo it's the one that be wit you, that be the true spot 
Tellin po-po I carry gun on my side 
Pullin me other with my shorties in my ride
But my man in the joint got connects from this side 
Lawyer bring a hundred times as well as twenty-five 
These the type of cats that celebrated few words or die
Smile in your face; tell your kind of lies  
Wanna come and be wit you just for an alibi
I'm meant to eat wit you, sleep wit you 
Get a couple of shorties, and come freak wit you 
Set you up to gear right, then go and beef wit you
If they couldn't sell your story on a pay-per view 
Want me the copper please, who I put... felony
Snitch all my homies so they set me free
And fore I'll be a rat I rot in the whole fam
Refugees in the game never give up the man

(Chorus: Pras)
It's the one that be wit you, creep and eat wit you
Actin powsey, powsey but they (frowsey)
It's the one that come around givin you all the pound 
Being loud and rowdy but they... (Stop actin) frowsey
(You think you fresh but you) frowsey 
(Your own Mom think you) frowsey 
(Uh) uh (uh)... frowsey 

(Pras) 
I'm callin everybody name in this here rap game
Frontin ass cats tryin to be around the fame
You know who the f you are, the ones with no shame 
Always complain, while somethin, never to blame
Foxy individuals, them cruddy ass criminals 
Come around and try to f... around with my decimals 
I got a big burette that gets no better 
If you want some trouble then look no further
If I'm poor I'll make a vocal, Meguan murder
So God so help me please control my temper
Fleas must please, say the word true indeed 
With friends like these yeah, you don't need enemies 
Informers wanna loose, take your notes
Before you see me drove I'll let the gun smoke
Love to sit back and watch them get blast 
Ingrave my name on they ass, Dirty Cash

(Chorus: Pras)
It's the one that be wit you, creep and eat wit you
Actin powsey, powsey but they (so)
It's the one that come around givin you all the pound 
Being loud and rowdy but they... (Stop actin) frowsey
(You think you fresh but you) frowsey 
(Your own Mom think you) frowsey 
(Uh) uh (uh) uh

(Interlude)
Keep it movin (frowsey)
Yo that sounds some cheap frowsey to me man
How can... how can you bleepin deal with me like that man?
Yo, just actin so frowsey (stop it)
Why you doin this to me man?

(*Man speaking over Pras*)

(Pras)
It's the one that be wit you, creep and eat wit you

Stop it (are you scared of frowsey?) why you doin that? (Stop it)
