Typed by: AZ Lyrics

What?
Yea

Worried bout a hater? Not me
Turned to the max, no sleep
Smoked a hundred joints to the face
Give a fuck what a bitch nigga say

Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me, everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (what?)

Rolling, pockets swollen
Riding in it like it's stolen
Weeded, hella conceded
If it ain't about money, nigga I don't need it
Got a hundred grand in my ashtray
Spend a hundred K on a bad day
And I'm tied up like a cholo
Nigga act crazy, my dogs go loco
Kush got me moving slow mo
What my nigga Poblem? That's my bro bro
Came in through the backdoor
Ten mill this year on the low low
And I'm still smoking free rolls
Krissed out, dumb fucking with the cliko
And my bank full of zeros
Young Wiz will get fly like a hero

Worried bout a hater? Not me
Turned to the max, no sleep
Smoked a hundred joints to the face
Give a fuck what a bitch nigga say

Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me, everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (what?)

Parling tongue with the mull, light a donut
So my weed that you is ever smoked up
Didn't make a chocker
Like a real low ride brother, feeling like a mil up a pill
Don't lock, we ain't letting all my bros in
But for sure we'll let yall hoes in
Guess when you pulling money out, baby loving it
Give a dick fore I give a bitch my government (what?)
That's 8, I got 8 more
Super-duper hot, 88 floor
Unzip this, that's 8 more
Fuck a pussy and fuck rhymin
We gon live forever, fuck dyin
Get it til I drop, fuck tryin
Pedal to the metal, we flyin
In the fast lane, yelling (diamond!)

Worried bout a hater? Not me
Turned to the max, no sleep
Smoked a hundred joints to the face
Give a fuck what a bitch nigga say

Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me, everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (what?)

Everything about me
Youg wild nigga, mouth full of gold teeth
Treenbay.com, like to swap meat
Goin crazy on a bitch until she knock me
I'm in that hella fast whip goin top speed
Make a mess in that pussy and then she mop clean
I drop racks and she drop G's
Smoke green as I lean, top droppin
Nigga I am all about a buck, falling out a truck
Probly with some hoes that I just met and yea they all gon fuck
Got a man calling up the homies, blowing all the mug
Tryna figure outwhich girl is, she probably toasted
Uh, like a champagne glass
So much money, there ain't a damn thing sap
Do my damn thing in my campaign add
Let's get straight to it, don't let a damn thing past me (what?)

Worried bout a hater? Not me
Turned to the max, no sleep
Smoked a hundred joints to the face
Give a fuck what a bitch nigga say

Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me, everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (bout me)
Everything about me (what?)</pre>
