Some of y'all niggas need to call your wife and your chaperone
Right motherfucking now 
Ya know why (Why, they got to call em why, why)
Cause the party's over dog (why, why, why)
Fire starters up in this motherfucker here 
(fire starters who the hell is that)
Fire starters is them niggas from MIA
(MIA I don't know shit bout no MIA)

Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha

[SupaStarr]
Nigga I don't give a fuck if your vest be on
When I spit one in your chest be gone
Y'all niggas done fucked up, y'all wanna test me huh
I make y'all spit the shit y'all got and wanna blast me what!

[Bulldog]
Y'all motherfuckers know me, homie
The one and only 
Sick beef stick to your bitch like baloney, homie
Me and chapter's more then Chromies, homie
Like we swim in the sauce like we Chef Ravioli

[Chapter]
I blaze these tracks with amazing raps
Bet y'all say who the fuck is that
Two twenty-five sport ice twice your size
Look at my clique
When we ride it's like icersize
Blind shine nigga

[Luc Duc]
It's so true nigga
When I'm broke I come and bust at you nigga
When I'm horny I can take your trick from you nigga
Peep game niggas
Y'all can't fuck wit us (wit us)

(Chorus)  
[Luc Duc (Others)]
We roll through like semis
What's that smoke trees coming from the M-I
(We laughing at ya)
Ha, Ha, (You Fuck with us)
Ha, Ha, (Dumb Bitch)

We roll through like semis
What's that smoke trees coming from the M-I
(We laughing at ya)
Ha, Ha, (We bucking at ya)
Ha, Ha, (Die Nigga)

[Chapter]
Nigga, we pop bottles and shells
Find us in south bay
Getting lit in custom model V-12s
We pimp and got models for sale
Pussy hot at the tail
Born to goggle dicks with throats deeper then whales
Don't call me Jehovah cause I only offer you hell
Fuck casket shopping and nigga seal your coffin with nails
Nigga

[Stage McCloud]
How many times must I tell everybody?
You not ready for Stage or my shottie
I send cats to heaven with guides like Scottie
Shut down blocks like Compton House Parties (that's right)
All you average Joes are straight sloppy
Poppi call me HIV you can't stop me

[SupaStarr]
Y'all niggas really don't know me
I Chill on the side like your chrome be
Blowing up shit like the phone be
Do my dirt all by my lonely
Taking that cheese like macaroni
Nigga

(Chorus)  

[Luc Duc]
Throw it up; if you feel you can thug like me
Take a bud light it up and get high like me
Take a trick lift her thighs lick her clit like me
Take a glock lick back and bust shots like me

[Tony Manshino]
It's the motherfucking K-I with the N-G in me
So call me ageless struggle Professor na, na Tree P

[Stage McCloud]
Y'all know we more clits then four dykes straight up
Beef with us might get you laid up or sprayed up
For real I'm sicker then flu season
No reason 
We pull gats till we see heavy breathing

[Chapter]
I'm bout to drop a dime on ya like a snitch to the feds
Take my shit in doses it might just fuck up your head
Beat this game now and all I'm seeing is red
And a bunch dead motherfuckers when I sliced your head

[SupaStarr]
Yo, yo, yo
I never stop folks
I squeeze till they brain on the condo
These niggas probably thinking like oh this from a model
I'm a trife ho
May I sight mighty tight?
Just know I'll blow your ass up quicker then Heidi Flight
Cause I'm the shit on this mic
Y'all niggas better off slinging dick to your wife

(Chorus)

(Ha, Ha in the background)
