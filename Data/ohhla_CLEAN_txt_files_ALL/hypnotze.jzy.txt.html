AYYYYEEE... x7

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Class in session when I talk, now listen
But you know how it goes, real niggas pay attention
Ain't talkin money, we speakin a different language
The hating niggas gon' need a translator
Lets GO!
They move too slow, when I think too quick
That's why I flash like Gordon, vrrreeeeooommmm
I'm light years ahead of you niggas
That's why I forgot more than you've ever learned
It's my spot now nigga, you better wait your turn
And that yayo shit, that's irrelevant
You can't hide the fact that I'm intelligent
Street smart, with a little book sense
A young nigga with a lot of common sense
They say I'm shallow, but I think so deep (how deep?, how deep?)
Deep as the abiss
So when you get a minute, take a look at my wrist
Wussup!?

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
Hypnotize, you will hypnotize
Hypnotize, you will hypnotize
Hypnotize, you will hypnotize
Hypnotize, you will hypnotize
Now I command you niggas to get money (Hey!)
Now I command you niggas to get money (Hey!)
Now I command you niggas to get money (Hey!)
Now I command you niggas to get money (Hey!)

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Rock ice, yeah nigga live life
Can't explain the feeling when I'm riding in the Chevy (Deeeuuummm!)
I'm on top of the world
Just it gives me the chills, yeah them big ol' wheels
A thousand there, with the dreams in "Mills"
Steak grands at the mall, yeah, just for thrills
Shit, I get it right back nigga, that's for real
It's all in the game, free throws and fouls
Half a "mill" in the basement, god damn I'm flagrant
I want it all, no matter the cost
Fuck the consequences, ain't nothing to a boss
Made a lot out of a little, something out of nothing
I'm so proud of me
With the streets on top, where they supposed to be
The sky is the limit, that's what Jesus said
And the limit is the sky
Let's slice that pie
Wussup!

[Chorus x2: Young Jeezy]
Hypnotize, you will hypnotize
Hypnotize, you will hypnotize
Hypnotize, you will hypnotize
Hypnotize, you will hypnotize
Now I command you niggas to get money (Hey!)
Now I command you niggas to get money (Hey!)
Now I command you niggas to get money (Hey!)
Now I command you niggas to get money (Hey!)
Hypnotize, you will hypnotize
Hypnotize, you will hypnotize
Hypnotize, you will hypnotize
Hypnotize, you will hypnotize
Now I command you niggas to get money (Hey!)
Now I command you niggas to get money (Hey!)
Now I command you niggas to get money (Hey!)
Now I command you niggas to get money (Hey!)
