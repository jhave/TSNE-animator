[Verse One: Ace Hood]
Ok I'm booked out until August, show money deposits
See the shit then I cop it got but a house note in my pocket
I'm on South Beach with that top off, bad bitch and her ass soft
Somethin out of that catalogue, she introduced to that lock jaw
And I think her name was Lisa, or maybe it was Sheila
My chevy sittin too high, I call that Wiz Khalifa
And I'm all about the new Franklins, ain't talkin Aretha
Bitch my league too major, I'm hip hop Derek Jeter
And I'm still feelin my pockets, big bass and it's knockin
Yeah this be that remix but still ride around with that rocket
I'll go walkin back to my household, We The Best be that logo
Hundred grand for that neck glow, all about the dinero
Nigga flow so retarded, we be getting gnarley
Oh kimosabe, it be me, Ross, Weezy party 'cause it's the..........

[Chorus: Ace Hood] (*Rick Ross)
Same old shit (SHIT!) Just a different day (DAY!)

Nineteen in my nina (WOO!)  Red dot when I ride up
Hundred deep in that K.O.D. King Of Diamonds thats me nigga
No you bitches can't get my beat, choppers only thing free n-ggas
Step to me and I teach you (HUH!)  Somebody text his picture
Straight drop in my beaker (Beaker!) Ace knockin my speakers (HUH!)

[Verse Three: Lil Wayne]
Ok now black card in my pocket, ridin 'round in that Gotti
Pistol off my boxers I aint got time to be boxin
Got a red bone she look tropic, If she fuck me right then she shoppin
Young money we poppin I eat these rappers Anthony Hopkins
See that V-neck, that's Polo, grilled up like Ocho
Chuck Taylors with no socks, You niggas chicken, Pollo
Nigga Liv on Sundays, King Of Diamonds Monday
Swagger just dumb, call it Kelly Bundy
Got a big house with a back yard, fish tank with sharks in it
Real nigga I'm authentic, I'll fuck the bitch 'til she short winded
Got a bad bitch who be bartendin, couple homies that gang bang
I get on anybody track, and hit that bitch with that Wayne train
Free my nigga T.I. Soo Woo to the bee hive
Got a G6 and a G5, You pussy niggas you feline
Don't stop the party, we be getting gnarley
Whoa kimosabe, I'm with Mack, Fucus and Marley
Cause it's, same old shit (SHIT!)  Just a different day (DAY!)
Out here tryin to get it (GET IT!) Each and ev'ry way (WAY!)
Mama need a house (HOUSE!) Baby need some shoes (SHOES!)
They want that Carter IV, bitch it's comin soon

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
Same old shit (SHIT!) Just a different day (DAY!)
Out here tryin to get it (GET IT!) Each and ev'ry way (WAY!)
Mama need a house (HOUSE!) Baby need some shoes (SHOES!)
Times are gettin hard (HARD!) Guess what I'm a do
HUSTLE! (HUSTLE!) HUSTLE! (HUSTLE!) HUSTLE! (HUSTLE!) HARD! (HARD!)
HUSTLE! (HUSTLE!) HUSTLE! (HUSTLE!) HUSTLE! (HUSTLE!) HARD! (HARD!)
