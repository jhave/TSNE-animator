[Intro: Dion]
You make me step my game up

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yeah, cause women come, women go
Until we all mature we ain't really try and grow
With the girl we seein we ain't really tryin though
Try and beat it up fast on the living room flo'
Got a little older, had to spend a little dough
Kept somethin in the pocket just in case I had to show
Shorties how I did it when I took 'em to the sto'
Took a few to the mo', lotto vouch for that
Nigga bounce to the fact things I did was dumb
I account all of that to bein young
Got a little age, got some understandin
The older women get the more concerned with companion-ship
It took me a while to get to this point
I don't expect all of y'all to understand this shit, uh
Read between the bass snares and kick
Everybody gettin judged by who they standin with, f'real

[Chorus: Dion]
You make me step my game up, game up, step my game up, yeah, step my game up
You make me step my game up, game up, step my game up, yeah, my game up
You make me step my game up

[Verse 2: Dion]
Some women fall in love be on some where you at?!
Your happy so she arguin gotta get back
I'm literally tryin stay on the right track
But you ain't trippin you aint't on that so that make me wanna come home
I'm a grown ass man
You see by my actions just where you stand
I'm tryin to get right and with you I can

[Chorus: Dion]
You make me step my game up, game up, step my game up, yeah, step my game up
You make me step my game up, game up, step my game up, yeah, my game up
You make me step my game up

[Verse 3: Phonte]
She said, "We should go out on a date"
I said, "That's cool, you can come to my house"
She said, "Nigga please, do better than that
Why the fuck I wanna come over and chill on yo' couch?"
I laughed cause it seemed she had me all figured out
And my game ain't work like it did befo'
Dem was days long gone, cause once they get grown
These hoes ain't impressed by Applebees no mo'
Gotta dig a little deeper for that P.F. change, for PF Chang's
And if you cain't afford it
You can still do thangs to show you ain't on no dumb shit
Take her to a gallery, museum or some shit
Thank God for you and all the crew that you run with
Givin new meaning to the blind date
You so offi-shall, but a nigga can't attract Crist-al
with a Boone's Farm mindstate, knahmsayin?

[Chorus: Dion]
You make me step my game up, game up, step my game up, yeah, step my game up
You make me step my game up, game up, step my game up, yeah, my game up
You make me step my game up game up, step my game up, yeah, step my game up
You make me step my game up, game up, step my game up, yeah, my game up
You make me step my game up

[Outro: Phonte]
Uh, ay listen baby
{*sings*} You make a nigga wanna go to the store and get some wine for you
*laughs* 'Member when you got your first apartment, you used to have chicks over
What was the #1 line you used to always use when you wanted to get 'em naked?
(BABY, DO YOU WANT A MASSAAAAGE?)
That's it, eh-heheheh, can't do it no mo', let's step it up man</pre>
