[girl]	Don't I know you?
[guy]	Do you?
[girl]	Well ahh.. I'm Laurie Kessler, haven't we met before?
[guy]	Have we?
[girl]	Maybe not

[Kool Keith]
Back stage! ..
See girl after the show I'm not to be idolized
Overwhelmed by a new obsessed fan
No I don't wanna answer your questions
Are you some kind of journalist, follow me around?
Come on in the bathroom
Now you wanna see how Keith acts at home
Call your girlfriends
Now you wanna see the way I P-I-S-S
Beggin me to get a magic marker to sign my name on your back
You're very young, and giggly with pre-washed Levi's on
You don't know how to act - let's party, how about it?
I don't wanna party drink Bacardi what you think I look like;
the purple dragon Barney?

[Chorus]
Back stage!  You're excited..  back stage passes!  
You're excited, girls lookin all around
Back stage!  You're excited..  back stage passes!  
You're excited, stop lookin all around
Back stage!  You're excited..

[Kool Keith]
I'm totally attracted to you, but you turn me off as a fan
Approachin me back stage with a guy that's not your friend
Lyin to get a laminate - is that your man?
Some weird guy starin at me like Peter Pan
There's no time to talk about how I got started in rap
I'm goin straight home
You don't know, I'ma leave you alone
Why should I waste my time, get no sleep?
I just got off stage, you're still complainin
You shoulda stayed on stage longer at the New Orleans Superdome
What you want from me?  You took my picture;
you got my autograph - I'm not tryin to crack any more Coronas
I hate the smell of beadies
and you have a bunch of dinky friends, and a adolescent staff
You are immature

[Chorus]
Back stage!  You're excited..  back stage passes!  
You're excited, girls lookin all around
Back stage!  You're excited.. 

[Kool Keith]
Laugh at yourself, put your whole world on the shelf
Do that stupid stuff with Weird Al Yankovich
Go try to figure out somebody else
First of all, you're living through my CD
Second you don't know me
Base your life on fan magazines I go shoppin everyday
When I'm in a small boring city you don't see me
If I told you I had eighteen hands
you're so tuned and tweaked out, your ass would believe me

[Chorus]
Back stage passes!  
You're excited, girls lookin all around
Back stage!  You're excited..  back stage passes!  
You're excited, girls lookin all around
Back stage!  You're excited..</pre>
