[Intro]
Fab: 5X
Can you be my B-A-B-Y?

M.S. : I'll never call another lover mine

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
And why would I, and why should I
when I seen a lady tonight, with my good eye that I would try and make
my..(baby..baby)
I was up in the club putting my hood high
When I saw you, and I stood by
Just lookin at your onion girl I could cry, and I could lie
I mean I could try and say you ain't sweep me off my feet
But only one thing could keep me off the street
and that's if you be my, B-A-B-Y
I can be why you always be fly
And I'm from B-Stuy, just like B.IG. was, that's how F-A-B does
We can sip something 'til we both be buzzed
In a V-dub and that's only be-cause

[Chorus: Mike Shorey]
Need someone to be my (baby)
Kind of girl you find in the club rockin those (baby) Phat jeans
Gonna find someone to be my (baby)
..I see some ladies tonight that should be having my (baby, baby)

[Verse 2: Fab]
After the baby talk, the goo goo ga ga
You like this, that, you do bla bla
Couple good jokes, a few brouhaha's, it's time to do you mama
First I'ma put you on your back
And make you scream out (baby)..just like I put you on the track

Then I'ma lay you on your side
And slowly stroke you while you telling me the way you feel inside
But my sex drive won't make me play you on the side
You know you get the keys any day you wanna ride
And my baby know how to start me up
You got the kind of kiss that'll speed a heartbeat up
And you got the kind of touch that'll gimme the chills
I ask you cuz I know you gonna gimme it real
It won't be fake, and don't we make a good couple
And won't we make a good(baby)?

[Bridge: Mike Shorey]
Ooh, if I seem just a bit taken, pardon me
But you're so amazing
I just want us to do this exclusively
Say you'll be my baby

[Verse 3: Fab]
My baby's the only one I bring to the villa
that can get the bling and the scrilla
Girl, I know you smooth enough to spring a chinchilla
and still take a sting of Tequila, the way you swing is a thriller
I'm watchin that like the boxing match in the ring of Manila
I wanna keep it comin like the singles of Thriller
I mean if you still uh..my B-A-B-Y

[Chorus]
