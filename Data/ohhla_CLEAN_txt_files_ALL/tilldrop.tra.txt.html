I'm sick of losing family, everytime I blink my eyes
And at the rate that it's going, fell like I need to stay inside
Cause I don't wanna be the next nigga, to fall in a coffin
Lord knows everybody, that I love die often
Or wind up in the cage, and I don't seem to understand
It ain't nothing but a few of us left, I can count on my hand
If I tried to make a song, for everyone that I lost
I'd prolly have a triple c.d., in my deck when I floss
And that's a damn shame, people entertained by pain
I think I'm only selling records, cause I'm going through it mayn
I received a phone call, from my old man today
He was going crazy, cause his older sister passed away
And in my mind, I think she looking down smiling away
But still it hurt, I'm writing this and it ain't even been a day
At least I got to giver her a kiss, and told her I love her
Hey Christina, promise it'll never be another damn

[Hook - 2x]
I'ma keep thugging, till the day I drop
Cause it feel like I'm losing, everything I got
On my knees asking God, is it ever gon stop
But he don't answer me back, I hope he help me out

[Trae]
To tell the truth I'm never being happy, now-a-days
In my everyday living, will make a nigga wanna blaze
I don't smoke, so I'm running reality head on
All the pressure and pain, coming to me is dead wrong
Only time I get to smile, is when I see my lil' boy
If he only knew I'm riding down, for my boy
I ain't got too many friends, so I'm riding by myself
Your own kin'll try to do you, when on a mission for wealth
I was told, every person get a day of they own
I guess they skipped over mine, I been in line for too long
Why they won't leave me alone, I just wanna have a life
I'm sick of living in the dark, tripping searching for the light
I'm a soldier so I fight, till I'm running out of breath
And I ain't running from the devil, it's war until the death
Dear Lord help me out, I think you missing all my calls
My back against the wall, and I ain't got no time to fall at all

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
It ain't no mo' telling me, that it's gonna be ok
I watched the judge, try to throw my roll dog life away
It's safe to say, any day I'ma be checking in
With everything that I'm facing, they gotta let me in
I only rap about the struggle, cause it's all that I know
I'm assuming people hate me, because it's all that they show
I never asked to be a rapper, I was stuck with it
And fuck this shit, cause I don't fell I'm having luck with it
And it seem like I'm really tripping, sometimes
And I really want, is the Lord to show me a sign
Cause everything been rough, when it's coming to me and mine
Since it's raining everyday, I'll be praying the sun'll shine
But it don't, and on the real I don't feel that it will
I'm the last one left, until I end up getting killed
I wanna turn away, but still I know that it's real
And deep inside I pray, that the Lord'll be my shield, my pain is for real
