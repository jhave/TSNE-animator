See my crew got me censored cause I say too much
But these rap ass niggas do it way too much
I'm always into some shit
They say I play too much
But this shit ain't a game
These lames done bit our shit!
They wasn't screamin' independent before 1996
They was shoppin' a demo
On a label, got dropped
Then they came back screamin' "Underground hip hop"
And I'm supposed to except it?
That's why you never see them featured artist on my record
They make good music, so I gotta respect it
But those two words
Are as close as we get to being cool and connected
I"m calm and collected
Till someone pushed a button 
Like these rap motherfuckers that be out there frontin'
I can't hold back
I just gotta say somethin'
You gotta understand
I feel it's my duty
To bang for my fans
So if you say it on a record and I catch you contradicting
I'm gonna step right up
And pull your card with the quickness
This culture is my life and y'all keep tryin' to make it business
So forgive me while I make my cash 
And keep my heart in it
Living Legends
We own the underground
While y'all hoes just rent it
Like that warehouse that you lived in
Deny it all day, but our influence is a given
Plus the whole industry 
Bit our live performance, tryin' to steal our energy
Your show wasn't hype when I used to pay to see
But now you jump around on stage lookin' gay as can be
It's plain to see
Who's the leaders of the pack
That's why I can see
Why my crew keeps comin' back 
To do a song with, bond with you
But y'all ain't about shit
So I'm not tryin' to get along with you
So shut your fuckin' mouth when you're talkin' to me
Sayin' you some successful independent MC
All that yappin', man please
Your pockets are as broke as my fuckin' Japanese
I'm servin' L.D.
Rollin' to L.D.
Y'all still stuck on CD-R so what the fuck you tellin' me?
Absolutely, positively not a motherfuckin' thang
We invented with game
Y'all gotta think about us
(With every tape you slang)
Y'all gotta think about us
(Whenever your show is lame)
Y'all gotta think about us
(When your girl ask you 
Mid City Living Legends to the death how I bang
Mid City Living Legends to the death how I bang
