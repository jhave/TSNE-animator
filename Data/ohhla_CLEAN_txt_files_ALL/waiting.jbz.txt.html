Song:   What 'U' Waiting For? 
Typed by: lyrical1@hiphopsite.com 

Come on! 
Jump up, freak a hustle 
Do what you want but move every muscle 
Ain't no time for playing around 
Only one thing to do when you hear this sound 
Act yourself with someone else 
And make sure yourself ain't by yourself 

Dyin' to get on the dance floor 
Girl what you waiting for? 
Come on over and swing with me 
take your mind out yo' misery 
Tomorrow's gonna be another day 
Tonight, I'm gonna take it- life 
Grab the world and put it on hold 
Relax my body and rest my soul 
Feel the vibe surrounding me 
Feel the bass come down on me 

Shake your butt but don't break your back 
Tap your feet and let your fingers snap 
No matter what size shape or colour 
We can jam and enjoy each other 
Music's pumpin' I feel something 
Must be my blood and h! eartbeat thumpin 
Dispense your funds to pass through the door 
You know there's room for you on the floor 
(You don't know if they'll be any more) 
So yo, what you waiting for? 

(Chanting in background) 
 "Waiting the timeless time" 

Yeah, yeah, some playin' a wall 
I wasn't with that, not livin' like that 
You ain't with it let me hear you say ho 
You ain't with it let me hear you say aaaaoooo (aaaooo) 
Ready to boogie I had on my dancin' shoes 
Ain't in the mood to be singing no blues 
So if you want to be a little disco ducka 
I came here tonight to  
So good morning, good afternoon, good night 
don't let the bedbugs bite 
Going way out when I'm aiming to please 
You havin' a good time, climb up my trees 
C'mon what you waiting for? 
C'MON what you waiting for? 

 "Waiting the timeless time" 

Side to side, and just let it ride 
Give what you got, no need to hide 
You're allowed as long as your able 
Take away the chairs and move away the tables 
I'm doing my thing working around you 
Ladies screaming (We wanna house you!) 
We won't say much on this no now 
Cause I'm not quite sure that you know how 
But keep on dancin', (Keep on dancing!) 
Baby on not clockin' you, I'm just glancin' 
And what I see now is a fine figure-8 
(Don't Make me Wait) 

Yeah waiting for the DJ to play my song 
O Lord, I must have waited all night long! 
The joint was packed and it looked like a jungle, 
I felt at home, there goes my song 
S! o I hit the floor and jumped on the case, 
Sweat pouring from my face 
Clothes was wet by I didn't care 
You know what I'm saying (I know what you're sayin') 

So come on girl come on girl come on 
Let's Let's Let's Get it on 
I'm dyin' to get out on the floor 
I waited long enough; I can't wait no more! 
Come on girl come on girl come on 
Let's Let's Let's Get it on 
I'm dyin' to get out on the floor 
I waited long enough; I can't wait no more! 

Yeah, Uh, Uh, Yeah, Uh, Yeah, etc. </pre>
