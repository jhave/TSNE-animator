We are CSD
What you know about a kickback
Show you how to kickback
Show where the chicks at
CSD we havin' a kickback
I'm bringin' in treats
I don't know where the tricks at
I make the flyers, the chicks are flyer
When I say it's gon' be rosed I ain't no liar
M-Bone gon' get them bottles
But they gon' be strapped with a couple of holla's
So it, won't be drama, well at least entirely
We gon' turn this night up like we in the Bahamas
Smokin' like Bob Marley was
Bog hogs so I ride in a Harley truck
We got a wild drink I put in a safari cup
No our hands on the edge screamin'
Turn, bring it up
The night just started
We 'bout to show y'all how the new edge party
We gon' keep it crackin' but the haters gotta leave
All the ladies can stay
I got some tricks up my sleeve

Don't turn me down just turn me up (turn me up)
Don't turn me down just turn me up (turn me up)
Don't turn me down just turn me up (turn me up)
Turn me up (turn me up) Turn me up (turn me up)
Don't turn me down just turn me up (turn me up)
Don't turn me down just turn me up) (turn me up)
Keep the haters out, bring the women in
Keep the drinks comin' we smoke in the wind

I make the door ring they like it's a kickback
How you gon' charge no time for the chit chat
Give me money if not, you can get back
Ladies go ahead, here's a cup my sip's at
Line is long, and we got the homies also
So if you ain't payin' me, then get the heck on
So now we movin' got the bros cruisin'
People walkin' out but I still ain't losin'
Pockets full and people still parkin'
Drinkers still pourin', fire's still sparkin'
It's cold as ice, but I'm still at the door
Women pay less, makin' haters pay more
Now we turned up, fucked about the shut down
People still comin' and I'm thinkin' man what now
Gettin' money and I deep when they after me
Lock the door then I scream, capacity

Don't turn me down just turn me up (turn me up)
Don't turn me down just turn me up (turn me up)
Don't turn me down just turn me up (turn me up)
Turn me up (turn me up) Turn me up (turn me up)
Don't turn me down just turn me up (turn me up)
Don't turn me down just turn me up (turn me up)
Aye keep the haters out, bring the women in
Keep the drinks comin', we smoke in the wind
Ya daddy it's a kickback (haha)
Hell yeah it's a kickback
Aye keep the haters out, bring the women in
Keep the drinks comin' we smoke in the wind
Ya daddy it's a kickback
Hell yeah it's a kickback

Kickback, it's way too lot
Got a bunch of girls that's turned inside
The music on and we hasty that we
Can't drive home and even make it
We've been here since nine o'clock it's 'bout
Time to go so y'all get out
Girls is stayin' but dudes is leavin' we
Close it down I feel like sleepin'
The girls are stayin' over the weekend so you
Know it's about to be some freakin'
In the mornin', we got some cleanin'
Moppin', washin', and vacuum sweepin'
We wreck the house but we have fun and
Nothin' stoppin' them girls from comin'
Count the money after the function
Wake up then go spend somethin' aye

Don't turn me down just turn me up (turn me up)
Don't turn me down just turn me up (turn me up)
Don't turn me down just turn me up (turn me up)
Turn me up (turn me up) Turn me up (turn me up)
Don't turn me down just turn me up (turn me up)
Don't turn me down just turn me up (turn me up)
Keep the haters out, bring the women in
Keep the drinks comin', we smoke in the wind
Ya daddy it's a kickback(haha)
Hell yeah it's a kickbak
Keep the haters out, bring the women in
Keep the drinks comin', we smoke in the wind
Ya daddy it's a kickback
Hell yeah it's a kickback

Say what? (say what)
Uh huh (uh huh)

Turn me up (turn me up)
Don't turn me down (don't turn me down)
Turn me up (turn me up)
Turn me up (turn me up) [x2]
Don't turn me down (don't turn me down)
Turn me up (turn me up)
