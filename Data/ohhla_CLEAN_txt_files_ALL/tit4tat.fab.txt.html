[Intro - Fabolous] (Pharrell)
Uh! (hah! hah! hah! hah-hah!)
Uh! (hah! hah! hah! hah-hah!)
Uh! (hah! hah! hah! hah-hah!)
It's my world! (hah! hah! hah! hah-hah!)
Ya heard?! (hah! hah! hah! hah-hah!)
Real Talk pha-real, ask my nigga Pharrell, ya heard?! Haha!

[Verse - Fabolous]
You see I do's what I choose on shiny twenty-two's
Be's what I please in brand new Bentleys
That's right stupid! Soon as they couped it, I went and scooped it
Now I'm on the move, on the move
Running the City, something like Diddy
At 150, wit the gun and the cd (wow!)
niggaz who be hunting for biddies
Never seen nothing this pretty, and they lying if they say they do
They bring the playa through like they bring the mayor through
They know the way I do is what the AK'll do
Listen here we can disappear for a day or two
Bet you come back smiling like Mase, c'mon!
Like Case say 'Touch Me, Tease Me'
But the Top Dawg tell her it must be easy
I'm in the white cut E-Veezy
Ashton Cuts be freezy, it must be easy!

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams]
See I ain't keep going tit for tat your ass ma
If your ass ain't talking right
Well you can stop acting boughie, asking for sushi
If fucking ain't your plans tonight, ya hear me?!
See I ain't keep going tit for tat your ass ma
If your ass ain't talking right
You can go back to being groupie in your Dapper Dan Gucci
If fucking ain't your plans tonight, ya hear me?!

[Fabolous] Girl move it like! Girl move it like!
           Girl move it like! Girl move it like.

[Verse - Fabolous]
You see I bop to the beat of the streets since I was born
Move like they would in the hood until I'm gone
The girls know my paper denim, keep paper in em
As soon as they change the shapes I'm in em
The BAPEs they send em wit snake skin in em
To the kid in the city wit the scrapers in em
(Nowww!) I move to left like.. then I move to the right like
They follow the need to follow my lead
Do the do then swallow my seed, like
You can leave the spot you cramped in
Live in the Hamptons like a champion
Refuse to choose the, use the loser
Don't let the hydro moves confuse ya
And pass on a stunner to go wit a fronter
If you wanna do the kick it then go wit a punter

[Chorus]

[Verse - Fabolous]
You see the white's so bright it's hard to be polite
The yellow's so mellow I have to act ghetto
Hello, my name is - fuck that! I'm famous
Y'all ain't the same as, F-a to the B
I don't know what it be, baby girl could it be
You ain't see how good it be rolling wit me?
Like - get me on or get me gone
It's at least 22's that they sit me on
I'm in the Ice Cream shoes, nice gleam too
Crack the button up so the ice beam through
You could wake up wit regrets, or wake up in a jet
Fixing you hairdo in a Jacob wit baguettes girl

[Chorus]

[Outro - ad-libs]
