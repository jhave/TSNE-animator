Hey, I just wanna see you doing good

Uh
From the first day I met you, I knew you were special
You had alot of drama, but I used to protect you
Being you was naive, yo I could not let you
Do alot of things so I had to correct you
I'm thinking if you juss went left instead of right
Right now, what would your life be like
And me, you know I love the good life
And you, I know you hate the hood life
I watch you as you turn and turn
And burn and burn from all your decisions
You could be a Christian, rich somewhere
But you ain't choose to listen, so get somewhere
Its never too late, 'till its too late
Right now, if you was with me
You be living in a new state
Riding around with new plates
Living in a new place
But you could'nt tell your crew wait
C'mon

 (Chantell)
 I wanna go back to the days (oh, oh, oh)
 You stayed and you were loving me (oh, oh, oh)
 And I was loving you, I was loving you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
 I wanna go, cuz I would do so many things,(uh, uh, uh)
 so differently, (party, party, party, party over there)
 Baby me and you would still be together (party, party, party, party over There)
 I wanna go back to the days (uh, uh, and you dont stop)

[Ma$e]
You know I see you on the beach
Feed her rose peddles, I tell you the truth
But then you wanna go settle
A girl like you is on another whole level
Tried to move you out the hood
But you scared to leave the ghetto
I told you, anything you say, you can have it
With me, I always spend a million on my fabric
Established, and lavish, carrots is a habbit
I'm married, and that dont mean I want you looking average
I thought you known that, take you where your zone at
Peeps, in the street, talking like they own that
I talk truth, but they only want facts
when you wanna do right, you know where your homes at
I tell you wait on Lennox, that mean wait a minute
Bracelit tennis, face it, we finished
And just because your not my girl
It doesn't mean your alone in this world

 (Chantell)
 1- I wanna go back to the days
 You stayed and you were loving me
 And I was loving you, I was loving you
 I wanna go
 Cuz I would do so many things, so differently
 Baby me and you would still be together
 I wanna go back to the days

[Ma$e]
I'm in love with a girl named Twyla
I'm in love with a girl from mississippi named Twyla
I'm in love with a girl named Twyla
I'm in love with a girl named Twyla Betha (Twyla Betha)
I said Twyla Betha,(Twyla Betha)
You know I'm in love
I'm in love with a girl named Twyla
I'm in love with a girl from mississippi named Twyla

(Repeat 1)

[Ma$e]
