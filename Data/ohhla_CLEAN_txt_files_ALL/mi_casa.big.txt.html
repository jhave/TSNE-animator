[Notorious B.I.G.]
You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep 'em in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
[Yeah we know, drop the scenario]
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knockin' some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the Gee's obsolete
Don't sleep! Banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rappin' to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got Gee
Now she fuckin him and fuckin me, see

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Mi casa, you casa (Oh)
I ain't lookin for no wife, I just wanna give dick to ya (Oh)
Hit the club, drink, dance all night wit cha
Do the pussy good, I might do anything for ya
Girl show me how to work that thing (Wo-oh)
You make a motherfucking thug wanna sing (Oh Oh)
Baby baby, can't you see? (Whoa)
We gon' fuck until six in the mornin (Whoa)

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruisin up the block, I be passin her
Pimpin hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, schemin on a gang-bang
She should've used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's sayin I dissed her 'cause I'm fuckin her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh
But she started that fuckin family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me?
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit yo' nasty ass

[Charlie Wilson]
Red bows, stilettos do please
Hit fellas to show off yo' booty
I'm hangin wit the best of them, sweet
If you wanna, I'm a veteran
When I show up to the club, it's V-I-P (Oh)
When they dressin in the club if it's B.I.G. (Ooh wee)
I'm not lookin to find a wife (Find a wife)
Just someone to make a friend of mine

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
I roll up, the black Impala
I'm so high when I walk in the club
I see this chick that used to get the dick
Now she freakin on the floor, make a nigga reminisce
Ah, wanna back in my ride again
But I don't want no girlfriend
See I just wanna hit it and we can be cool
We can do this if you feelin the same way too
Come on girl, lets go to my hotel
After party all night in my hotel
Pop mo', smoke 'dro in my hotel
In twenty minutes, girl hit me on my cell

[Chorus]</pre>
