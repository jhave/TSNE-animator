[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I sit with this broken heart, like why did you leave me bitch
With a bottle of painpills, I swear this ain't easy bitch
I though we would ride together, you and me we would die together
Walk through the bowels of hell, like fuck it we'll fry together
You walked out and left me here, along with a fist full of tears
I drowned in my sorrow, I can't believe i wasted this many years
You didnât have the decency to tell me you leavin, you left a note on the dresser
Oh, what the fuck, this bitch cheatin', you left me for him?
Ho that's a good enough reason for me to come and kill both of you
Guess it's back to this grieving, it's back to these nightmares
Itâs back to not sleepin', it's back to me tearing this fucking house up and screaming
I remember you cutting yourself with razors and bleeding
And you told me my love was the only reason you're breathing
I was always right there for you, I thought I was special too
What happened to us? Bitch, I'm killing whats left of you
Bitch!

[Chorus]
Yeah, and you said that you would die for me
Just another love story, and i swear the pain hurts so bad
Feel like I had a heart attack
Heart attack
Heart attack
You ripped my fucking heart and it ain't no facing that
Heart attack
Heart attack
Iâll never love again, it ainât no turnin' back

[Verse 2]
I'm turning to Lucifer, I swear I ain't thinking right
I'm drinking again, I'm parked by your house at night
I see that you're happy with him, you know it's just eating me
The thought of you fucking him makes me sick
It repeatedly, plays in my brain, it drives me insane
And of course when it rains I try to block out the pain
But fuck I just can't, get over this bitch
I think I need help, I can't get over this shit
So I muster the courage to come and knock at your door
The closer I get I feel my heart fall to the floor
You open it up, you look in my eyes
It's been a whole month, bitch, oh you look so surprised
And I get this feeling of so much rage and i grab her right by the face
And sheâs screamin Iâm erkin, cursin, I hate you bitch
We both spewin hatred, shit, I know i should leave
But a part of me ain't satisfied until i see her bleed
She's screaming for help, as I squeeze on her neck
You owe me this explanation for me and you separating
That shit was so devastating, I feel her soul levitating
The sound of her suffocating, she's dying from strangulation
So cold and so dark, til death do us apart
God dammit I love you, look at me falling apart
This pain is so deep, and it bites like a shark
I stick you right where you hurt me, and put this blade through her heart
And she's out!
