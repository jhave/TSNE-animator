(Silkk the Shocker talking) + [Erica Foxx]
Uh, uh, uh ha, yo, uh it's about to go down, (it's about to go down)
Shorty bring your friends cause uh I got my niggas wit me &amp; you
Can't act a fool(it's about to go down)[down, down],
Shit don't be actin' shy or nothin'(It's about to go down)[down, down]
Tonights tha night how we (It's about to go down)[down, down]
You know we bout dat (It's about to go down)[It's about to go down]
No Limit style[down, down]It's about to go down[down, down]
Hoppin' outta Hummers &amp; shit(it's about to go down)Cadillac trucks
(It's about to go down)[down, down]

[Silkk]
Look we all can ball shorty, look cause it got room at tha top
Tell shorty in tha back, that dress has room in tha drop(get in)
Shit for real I'm doin' what they not
An you know how I kick it (ball til' I fall) for real, TRU or not
Hit tha skins til' you tell me ta stop
Beat it up so bad shorty yo gonna have ta run &amp; tell tha cops
Shit bring one friend
I got my nigga P wit me so you gotta bring one for him
You know how we roll, six hundreds &amp; shit, Hummers for tha summer &amp; shit
What you talkin' bout, you know how we be comin' in this bitch
I'm in this bitch like shit knowin' I'm fly
"Silkk you say you love me &amp; shit"  girl come on you know how I lie

[Chorus: Silkk &amp; (Erica Foxx)]
It's about to go down (down, down)
Party at tha spot, it's about to go down(down, down)
Everybody gets in, it's about to go down(down, down)
Drinks on me, it's about to go down(down, down)
Six hundreds &amp; shit, it's about to go down(down, down)
Hoppin' out tha limo, it's about to go down(down, down)
Party in tha hood, it's about to go down(down, down)

[Master P]
I did time in tha jail but never rat to tha feds
I know homies locked down for life, never boast or brag
Missy said "I got glock boy," I drive a drop boy
An I'm a soulja, I ain't no hot boy(ya heard me)
Now if ya ain't got it, go get it, see my click keeps it real
We started in tha projects but we own houses on tha hill
I don't own no plane, nigga no chopper but I ride first class
I got a couple of super models wit my name on they ass(ha ha)
It ain't my fault that we back on top
But back yo bitch ass up from my convertable drop
They call me tha ghetto Bill Gates cause I started from tha streets
Diesel laced tha beat, I'm out that C-P-3
An yall know how we roll ya heard me(ya heard me, ha ha, hoody)

[Chorus: Silkk &amp; (Erica Foxx)]
It's about to go down (down, down)
Party at tha spot, it's about to go down(down, down)
Everybody gets in, it's about to go down(down, down)
Drinks on me, it's about to go down(down, down)
More bitches than niggas, it's about to go down(down, down)
Ain't nodody trippin', it's about to go down(down, down)
We all got money, it's about to go down(down, down)
An if we ain't got it, it's about to go down(down, down)
V-I-P nigga, it's about to go down(down, down)
Everybody flossin', it's about to go down(down, down)
Everybody shinin', it's about to go down(down, down)
Everybody real, how yall likin' me now

[Silkk]
You know me &amp; this No Limit shit, always represent
Pull up in tha six hummer like tha muthafuckin' president
Love to see my name in begets
Whisper to shorty(tryna do somethin') all you gotta do is say yes
An I'm gonna probaly take you out to tha crib
In other words take you out where I live
Show you around like you ain't never seen befo'
I usually(uh un) don't be seen wit hoes
Only top notch chicks that's out to represent me,
Ain't shy, quick to undress up in tha bentley
Look shorty that's my yacht, that's my spot, that's my drop
You guessed it, yes I'm up on top
Not tryin' to stop, tryna make a couple million
An see if me &amp; you can make a couple children
I through wit it, I'm through frontin'
You know what I'm about, tryna see if you tryna do somethin'
What,

[Chorus: Silkk &amp; (Erica Foxx)]
It's about to go down (down, down)
Party at tha spot, it's about to go down(down, down)
Everybody gets in, it's about to go down(down, down)
Drinks on me, it's about to go down(down, go down, go down)</pre>
