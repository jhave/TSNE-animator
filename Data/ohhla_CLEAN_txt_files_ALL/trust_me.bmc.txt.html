And I'm here to show you that I'm not
Cause I ain't tryna play with ya heart
And have yo thinkn in ya mind that I'm only tryna fuck

So lil mama listen up

And I know you probably thinkin yea right

And be the only nigga that you really need in ya life
Baby girl stop playin So baby girl stop playin
Cause I ain't tryna waste time, Cause I wanna make you mine
