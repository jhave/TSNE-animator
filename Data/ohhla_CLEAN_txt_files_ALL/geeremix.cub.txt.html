[Lil Ass Gee]
Hell naw nigga fuck this
Nigga let me up out of here!
Nigga y'all can't take me to jail anyway
I don't even know why y'all got me gaffled
Look, fuck that, when my big homies find out about this shit
y'all gon' be workin in Alaska, so dress warm motherfucker

[Ice Cube]
Hahahaha, yeah

"This type of shit it happens ev-ery-day" -&gt; Slick Rick (2X)

[Ice Cube]
Look at that lil' ass Westside loc'ed out
insane-in-the-brain little nigga servin 'caine
Use to have to ask could he cross the street
Now he's rollin in a G, the G is on E
He's quick to hit you up with the two fingers spreaded (Wassup?)
He'll roll that shit (Wassup?) and hold that shit (Wassup?)
Now you know what fuckin set he's claimin
A wild little nigga and it ain't no tamin
And just when you think everything is calm
that motherfucker is the first to bomb (like the)
bang, ping, catch you with the sleeper
He'll draw down, and then check his beeper (fool)
He's clockin them chips and bucks
Gettin, his little dick sucked by the, clucks (yeah)
And will he do dirt? Fool oh please
Little loc's are harder then the O.G.'s (that's right)
You fall to the ground and then bleed
Just got served by little niggaz on a 10-speed
Twelve years old, got bumps they can't keep
A straight killer, a fool, a lil' ass gee
(a lil' ass gee) (a lil' ass gee)

[Lil Ass Gee]
	Hey, you little niggaz need to get up out the spot man
What, what nigga you think I'm a lil' punk or somethin?
	What you trippin for man?
Nigga fuck yo' life! {*BLAM BLAM, BLAM*}

Chorus: N.O. Joe Johnson

When you run for yo' gun, just to save yo' life
it's just a .. little ass gee
When you hatin on these fools on these motherfuckin streets
I'm just a .. little ass gee
When I step up on yo' ass with the shank
niggaz know it's just a .. little ass gee
Just a young motherfuckin tryin to clock my grip
I'm just a .. little ass gee

[Ice Cube]
God damn, it's a trip
Use to have the G.I. Joe, with the kung-fu grip (yep)
Now it's straight Crip, or Blood
Now ya sag, you used the flood (mark)
Now you're known as the baby Droopy (yeah)
Goin to camp, and it ain't Camp Snoopy (Wassup?)
But I ain't surprised
It's 12 months later, yea, I see you got a little size
You motherfuckin crook
You want respect cause you didn't get'cha manhood took
Drinkin that 'gac like it's no tomorr-y
Westside hustler, fuck Atari
Been to jail, and it ain't no thang
Can't wait til you get 22's on the hang (nigga look)
A underage boy that's smokin tye
And that's your idea of junior high
All you want for Christmas is guns and triggers
Little nigga nuttier than a Snickers
You don't wanna be like Mike, you wanna be like me
A fool, a killer, a lil' ass gee
(a lil' ass gee) (a lil' ass gee)

"Crazy motherfucker from around the way" -&gt; Cube (N.W.A.)

Chorus

[sampled interlude]
We have people, that have been conditioned
not to expect to live, beyond the age of 30
They no longer care
Once they no longer care, they're extremely dangerous

"I'm not afraid of bein shot
 cause that's the environment I grew up in"

[Ice Cube]
See, I knew it wouldn't be long (tell 'em)
They got yo' ass stretched like Stretch Armstrong
in the one-man cell, it got'cha thinkin
Sendin more kites than Benjamin Franklin
Twenty years old but ya still a veteran
Won't touch down til we're livin like the Jetsons
Proud of yourself, because ya done done it
Gotcha 22's and your name on your stomach
Never even think about a woman to fuck
Rather stand in line to bust the ass of a young buck
(Who's next?) Got stuck, now you're bleedin
Hospital ward, is got your reading
Learn about the knowledge of self ya see
Got ya mad enough to go and stick the deputy
See, it ain't about bein hard (that's right)
but that's whatcha tell the little homies on the yard
Ya already done did ten
and wish you could start all over again
Brand new inmates, and who do ya see
Your baby brother in shackles, a fool, a lil' ass gee
(a lil' ass gee) (a lil' ass gee)
A fool, a lil' ass gee

Yo this go out to the little hardhead homies
who probably gon' see more uhh, asshole.. than pussyhole
when they get you in that system, and I ain't trippin
