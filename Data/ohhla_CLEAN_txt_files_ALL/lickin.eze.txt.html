[Eazy-E]
You want this baby
I want it hot and juicy
and thats the way I like it
you know thats right
you know how to kick it
I mean can I stick it
so you want me to slap it 
flip and rub it down
alright I want you to turn 
round so I can hit it from the back ok
you like it like that baby
who's is it, is it mine baby
can I eat it, I mean can I lick it
can I stick my tongue all in it
