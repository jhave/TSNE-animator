Hello.. woo, HEY!

[Rev Run]
Here's a little story 'bout a boy named Joey
King of the world, got a very long story
Made a lot of money, live a life of glory
Did what he done but he end up sorry
Beat a lot of suckers and he banged down bums
Made a lot of records and he tricked the funds
Took it to the top and he stayed number one
But he never looked back to the place he's from

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
High and mighty, highty mighty Joe
Stomped out crews everywhere he goes, highty mighty Joe
Stomped out crews everywhere he goes, highty mighty Joe

[Rev Run]
Joe was a leader way before his time
Made _Piper Peter_ and he kicked much rhyme
Had a two-seater and he rode past signs
Smoked a lot of cheeba and he drank much wine
One day Joey had to stop his scheme
Got a revelation and he came back clean
Got a second chance to fulfill his dream
Now Joey is a Reverend and he live redeemed

[Chorus]
