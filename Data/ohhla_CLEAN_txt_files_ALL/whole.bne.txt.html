This is for..

(Chorus)
The whole wide world, 
The whole wide world, the whole wide world, the whole wide world 
And your neighborhood, and your neighborhood, and your neighborhood, 
and your neighbor hood

(Verse 1)
Thank God for the love
cause a nigga was up in the club lookin down on nigga rat scum
Don't wait a single black daddy
with six litttle babies and one hell of a job 
Mob in and out cities why is these niggas mad at me? 
They say I'm pretty and he dont want his daughter to see 
I'm Lil Bizzy thank god for my destiny 
I love ya momma aint no drama in a breath of me

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
I barely made it I was runnin around faded gunnin the town up 
Comin around the corner jesus I found ya 
Dead bodies, my sister stilll wanna party 
Nobody can stop me, nobody can stop me 
You want everything you want stop searchin for your solemate 
Cause you got cha one lets take it easy help him with the homework
Dicipline yall dont need the yellin

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I met hear at a party ready to fuck 
And I aint give a fuck casue she in another nigga truck
You can have that bitch back as soon as I finish I'm fourteen 
So I nigga kinda get it
She's a motherfuckin slut the real whatta you know? 
I fell in love the real was I fell in lust
Young and dumb and full of cum 
Bitch can I fill it up? damn got a baby in nine months 
We was on the getup I was at home cleanin they shit up
Been up since three o'clock in the mornin (the fuck you want!?) 
You got a nigga with your fake ass

Fuck that keep walkin walkin
Always talkin make shit nothin and that shit gone kill ya
Betta take caution bitch I'm still that killa, killa, killa, killa

(Chorus Repeat Until Fade)</pre>
