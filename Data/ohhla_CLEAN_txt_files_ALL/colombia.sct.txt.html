Song:   Colombia
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I can make cocaine
I just fell in love with a Cuban
I just left Colombia
Always making bricks, me and Hector
Teach them how to remix gave me metric tons
Isabella that's his little sister
She love me cause I know what them bricks do
I can serve you. I pull tricks too
But I can make cocaine
I promise you'll never see a drought again
I fly back to Colombia
I always make them million dollar runs

[Chorus: x2]
I can make cocaine
I just fell in love with a Cuban
I just left Colombia
Now we get them in by the metric ton

[Verse 2]
I can make cocaine
It don't take but 8 minutes to make a whole thing
But I be selling metric ton
You can cop one for a million
Black amigos send them packs long distance
Put my stove in the bathroom not the kitchen
Walk in the door you see 60 pistols
By any means necessary, we about them bricks fool
I was selling bricks since high school
Foreign whip rider when I slide through
But I don't sell dog food
Fill out your application, come to brick school

[Chorus x2]
