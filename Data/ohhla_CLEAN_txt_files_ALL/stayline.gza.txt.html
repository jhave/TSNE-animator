[GZA] 
Throw down ya mic son, ya gauge is empty 
Plus the wack shit in the game might tempt me 
Quickly drop non-stop rec shot 
What I took on the road on the lap and desktop 
A mixture from up-tempo to slow grooves 
8-Track figure that's mixed wit Pro Tool 
I rhyme wit sense the paragraph was intense 
Area's dense with the flow from the sentence 
Engine powered by five hundred horses 
Press by a threat of joint forces 
For emcee's who spit rap to cause beef 
Cause they depend on wild kill for fresh meat 
On the board, you're just a piece that's captured 
Weak is the land that's laying in the pasture 
The plug that gave ya juice, I might pull it 
Can't escape these endless waves of rap bullets 

[Chorus: Santi White (GZA)] 
They got no place for me 
In my life can't you see? 
I must not push or bite it tell me 
Stay in line, Stay in line (Stay in line) 
Stay in line, Stay in line (Stay in line son) 
Stay in line, Stay in line (Stay in line kid) 
Stay in line 

[GZA] 
I'm not insane in fact I'm kinda rational 
Chrome-plated serrated swords slashing you 
I shine light to the mic 
That's filled with the unspoiled water that sprits with light 
But um, you get high of the wealth and livin' large 
We rely of the stealth of camouflage 
Cut supply lines, flood ya mans market 
From high altitude cover the land target 
Lost in the desert, the journey is stressful 
Where the rescues are unsuccessful 
They perish while they search for it, intriguing treasures 
Should of taken precautionary measures 
The rhyme with the shank in the yard that kept stabbing ya 
A shakedown from Alcatraz to Attica 
Because we rock the jails 
Wit it and mase write the verse on the walls of cells 

[Chorus] 

[GZA] 
Ya out cold, ya styles old 
Allah just rolled, attack his skull wit a plan less bone 
Hit ya king with a Check that caused directly damage ya disco tech 
Shoulda' Protect ya Neck 

[Santi White] 
And do they think they got me? I don't know 
They seen ya picture baby? Don't think so 
Now do your mission and while you were thinking 
Ain't no collision that'll stop me from screaming 

[GZA] 
Involving movements, controlling the squares that's closed in 
Wit impact, in fact ya zone is frozen 
Submerged in deep blocks of ice 
Sceaming a wise by the high-tech devise 
The slightest fame can bring pain and torture 
The author, who came with a burning offer 
Published by whoever made it must own it 
Is just symatomic for one chaotic moment 

[Chorus]</pre>
