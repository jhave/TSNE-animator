Lots of knowledge cause this world is my college
Where I teach and preach your whole contract jack
Go with Large Pro and only get fact non-fiction
Relaying with mad prop addiction
With a twisted rhyme its that time
For me to not need prolong any more
Once again to my friends the name of this song is
