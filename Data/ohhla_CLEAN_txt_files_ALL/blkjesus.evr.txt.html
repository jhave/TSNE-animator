[ VERSE 1 ]
They call me White Devil, Black Jesus
Heaven closes, hell freezes
Egos trippin, scripts keep flippin
Bloods keep bloodin, Crips keep crippin
Time keeps slippin and I keep fallin
I can't see but I hear them callin
Ballers ballin, players playin
Haters fightin, righteous payin
Dawn breakin, I can keep makin
Brooklyn keep takin, shook ones keep shakin
No time for fakin, not me
I ain't jumpin no bars, just risin like cream
And if you diggin the scene, you feelin the vibes
Throw your hands in the air, scream out you alive

Singin
Na-na-na-na-na
Singin
Na-na-na-na-na
Singin
Na-na-na-na-na
Singin
Na-na-na-na-na

[ VERSE 2 ]
They call me Black Jesus, White Moses
Heaven freezes, hell closes
B-boy poses, punk rock chicks
The kids are alright but I need my fix
If you dig in the mix, feelin the drugs
If you keepin it real, if you livin like thugs
I spit kisses and hugs like .45 slugs
Come back on the one and kiss my love gun
Got a look that'll kill, voice that'll carry
Half a dozen women that I think I wanna marry
Got trouble on my mind, I'm refusin to lose
And still I gotta find me someone to abuse
So won't you run spread the news, help say the word
You jump the fuck back and just act like you heard

They call me 
White Devil, Black Jesus
Heaven closes, hell freezes
Black Jesus, White Moses
Heaven freezes, hell closes

Singin
Na-na-na-na-na
Singin
Na-na-na-na-na
Singin
Na-na-na-na-na
Singin
Na-na-na-na-na

Singin
(Waaaah-wah-wah-waaaaah
Shooby-doo-waaah
Waaaah-wah-wah-waaaaah)

[ VERSE 3 ]
They call me white sinner, black martyr
Livewire, firestarter
Jungle Brother, redneck cracker
Freak of nature, new world slacker
Sex junkie lookin for a dealer
You could play the leper, girl, and I could play the healer
Shit is only gettin realer, baby, haven't you heard
That the Bird, Bird, Bird, yes, the Bird is the word
It go one for the troubled, two for the times
Three for my homies and four for the dimes
Singin lemons to the limes to the break of dawn
Excuse me (six minutes) Everlast, you're on
And it go on and on like a rolling stone
Baby, anywhere I lay my hat is my home

They call me 
White Devil, Black Jesus
Heaven closes, hell freezes
Black Jesus, White Moses
Heaven freezes, hell closes

Singin
Na-na-na-na-na	(repeated till end)</pre>
