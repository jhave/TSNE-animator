[Swizz Beatz - Intro]
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Two hands in the air, if he don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, the shit ridiculous
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Middle finger in the air, if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous, huh!

[Kanye West]
I'm so appalled, Spalding balled
Balled in and Donald Trump takin dollars from y'all
Baby you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you dont mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn 
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweepin
That know we get Os like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know, the day that you play me'll 
be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke - Voila!
Praises due to the Most High - Allah
Praises due to the most fly - Prada
Baby I'm magic - tah-dah!
Address me as your highness. high as United 
30,000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writin bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas goin through real shit, man they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
Thats why I rather spit something that got a pur'

[Chorus: Kanye West, CyHi the Prynce]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean the shit is, fuckin ridiculous...
Fuckin ridiculous 
I mean the shit is, fuckin ridiculous
   Five-star dishes, different exotic fishes
   Man this shit is, fuckin ridic-a-lous...
   Fuckin ridic-a-lous...

[Jay-Z]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
Alla y'all can suck my balls thru my draws
Dark Knight feeling: die and be a hero
or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most-hated
But would you rather be underpaid or over-rated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
and 'Ye already told you +We Major+, you cockroaches!
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
amd Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil, so I spent another thirty
'cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me!
Fuckin insane, the fuck am I sayin?
Not only am I fly, I'm fuckin not playin/plane/plain
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burnin they little bridges, fuckin ridiculous

[Chorus]

[Pusha T]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half-a-mil in twenties is like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by 21
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
Since you lookin at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watchin it take shape
While to you, I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove' leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes come in a baker's dozen
Claimin they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she dissappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doin time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the lLegends of the Falls
Spill it, I own you all, EYUCH~!

[Chorus]

[CyHi The Prynce]
Huh, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had a iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places, the favorite 
Huh, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard for me to not waste it
The new commandment: Thou shall not hate, kid
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggaz, baby those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to +March+
Heh, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a +seven+ on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
Hah, G-A-T in the Pathfinder...
'cause you haters got PHDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[RZA]
Aiyyo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know the shit is, FUCKIN ridiculous!
...Fuckin ridiculous!
You know the shit is, FUCKIN ridiculous
Cars for the Mrs. and furs for the mistress
you know that shit is fuckin ridiculous
...Fuckin ridiculous!
You know the shit is, FUCKIN ridiculous! {*echoes*}
...FUCKIN ridiculous! {*echoes*}
...FUCKIN ridiculous! {*echoes*}
...FUCKIN ridiculous! {*echoes*}

[Swizz Beatz - Outro]
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Two hands in the air, if he don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, the shit ridiculous
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Middle finger in the air, if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous, huh!</pre>
