(Mac Dre)
I was with my nigga Sporty, we was comin' outta Yam Yams
Seen a bad bitch in a six and was like God Damn
Love me long time, yellow skin chopsticks
A notch bitch who looked like she can chop dick
I said stop quick, lil' mama pull over
Oh man if I knock this bitch, oh boy it's over
She said, I'm sorry I ain't tryin' to be rude
But I'm a lesbian and I don't fuck with no dudes
I ain't mad at ya I'm tryin' to join the party
Fo' real I'm a dyke trapped in a man's body
She bit quick, hook, line and sinker
And I was all in her mentals the first time I seen her

(Dubee)
Let me get off in your mind, intertwine with yo' thoughts
I rearrange thangs, strange lessons I was taught
I mean, I shufflin', hustlin', doing my thang thizzle
I ran up on a bizzle, bossed up and checked the dizzle
She was a Mazda ho, responsible
With tactics, like them hat tricks
Makin niggas do back flips 
And so being the nigga that I be, fo sheez 
I had to peak and see, Oh boy what she can do for me
I reckon I bring chit-chat
And get me more than a thin crack in a nut shell 
No tuck tail Ya know that
I flow this shit like niagra, mouthpiece like a ???
Choppin' this pimpin' like it's karate

(PSD)
The first time I seen her
I was just hollerin at her all the things that I could think of
She's so fine, she a dime
She my kind, gotta make that mine
Cuddies holla at the beezies first .. ..(fades out)</pre>
