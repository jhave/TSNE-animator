Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
And I'm back to the drinkin'
Soakin' wet every bottle's open
Can't believe it I'm occasionally smokin', again
With a deep and cloudy ocean, I'm in
Have a lot of trouble copin', my friend
I'm surrounded by folks when they lovin' me the most and
The goad is really croakin', within
Thought I was superman the truth was
I used to be clean as a loofah and I used the
Cool devoured the booze to hand I lose the
Land if I triple booze the fans
I dream of stoppin' but greed is knockin'
They feelin' me from me from KC to Aukland
Proceed with caution, heat exhaustion
If I keep it goin' I'm gonna need a coffin

[Chorus: Tyler Lyon]
Forever takes me away
And I've fallen from grace
Tell them I've tried to wait
But they're too late
I can see when this pain will fade
Oh god heaven is callin' my name

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I feel that pain comin' from inside
My people had the same drinkin' and then died
Devil in my brain I'm sinkin' within pride
Drinkin' for lunch and I'm drinkin' for dinner
I'm nothin' but lush when I'm pushin' up in her
I seldom remember the 8th of November
Cause I be goin' so hard I'm always on a bender
I got money, I got cash
So picture unlimited amounts I got stash
When it got bad I went out and got trashed
When I hit glad what'chyo think's in my glass
I gotta catch me, I'm fallin'
Not a limit to a young brother ballin'
Gotta let go of the weight I'm haulin'
When I look in the mirror within my eyes I'm headed for that callin'

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Go hard or go home
That's the motto I hit the lotto
Mister sorrow can miss tomorrow
So grip the bottle of this Moscato
My eye whites are not white
They hot fire and not nice but in my ice
I need a shot twice
(Drunk, I...Might, die)
(Falling, down...Gonna, drown)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Make way for the idiot
Interior is hideous
Need help like immediate
He actin' like he don't know alcohol is insidious
While I celebrate life
I'mma elevate heights
Not known to man cause I chose to ban
My clock on the land on a hella great night
I'm knowin' this my callin' so I gotta try to miss that call and
Alcohol and you twist that big sack and hit that
Think I better quit that stallin' and stop
Feelin' real gotti I'm mixin' my liquors
You gotta get me at the party
Naturally naughty
Please help I'm still trapped inside of this psycho's body!
