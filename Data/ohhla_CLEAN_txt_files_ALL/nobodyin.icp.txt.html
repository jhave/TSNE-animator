All ya'll young mutha fuckers comin in the game 
Think ya'll gonna change this shit 
We the muthafuckin' Rydas bitch 
That's mutha fuckin' Cell Block 
That's Bullet 
That's Lil' Shank 
That's Foe Foe 
And that's Full Clip 

Thats five muthafuckin' Rydas for life bitch 
Foe Foe bring the heat 
When I speak I make the walls all crumble 
Sittin' in the 655 with the bumble 
Niggas haul off for a block of the cheese 
Pop a weak nigga right in his knees 
So will I die (bitch please) 
Gettin G's by any means nessesary 
That's why my cousin doin' time and my dogs got barried 
Ya'll bitches is afraid of da game 
Sittin' posted on the corner and sayin' 
Makin' money fuck the fame 
Insane in the brain and quick to pull a gat 
So quick to lay your punk ass flat 
I'm the poster boy for car jacks 
And my name is Foe Foe 
Anybody got a problem with me 
Bring it to my door 
And Im'ma let my gun unload 
And watch tha back of your muthafuckin' head explode 
I'm from tha streets where you hustle for your rep 
Anbody wanna step they gon catch it you can bet 

It ain't nobody in this game that hold it down like us 
It ain't nobody in this game even close to us 
It ain't nobody in this game that'll bust like us 
It ain't nobody in this game nigga, game nigga 
It ain't nobody in this game that hold it down like us 
It ain't nobody in this game even close to us 
It ain't nobody in this game that'll bust like us 
It ain't nobody in this game nigga, game nigga 

Bitch I'm Full Clip 
But you can call me Dream Cast 
Ahead of the game so far number 1 looks last 
See tha gat blast, hear lead whistle by ya ear 
Deaf by the sound, vision blinded by the glare 
Of the dusted the fuck down in ice chips 
Hatchet representin' in the window of the black 
Fuck a grip and them bustas get no love 
Rydas run this muthafucka throw ya hatchets up 
Ain't nobody in this game worth speakin' about 
Cause the Psychopathic Rydas always freakin' them out 
We be like hustlin po po's and we slang them bobos 
Leavin' muthafuckers missin' like the electrifyin Mojo 
Killas don't talk but we be quick to lay them out 
And then appear at your funeral like what you cryin' about 
We dressin' up all in black, we pack a hoodie and attack 
And leave you layin' on the floor like a gorrilla came in an broke your back 

It ain't nobody in this game that hold it down like us 
It ain't nobody in this game even close to us 
It ain't nobody in this game that'll bust like us 
It ain't nobody in this game nigga, game nigga 
It ain't nobody in this game that hold it down like us 
It ain't nobody in this game even close to us 
It ain't nobody in this game that'll bust like us 
It ain't nobody in this game nigga, game nigga 

You couldn't see a fuckin' thug with a microscope 
And there ain't a crew in the industry half as dope 
As Rydas be Foe Foe on the side of me 
Mashin' out of control and reachin' the vacinity 
Witness real g's with real rythem and real rhyme 
And we takin over hoods one block at a time 
Well hold on before you fold up 
And get loked that's when the niggas grab the sawed off 
Time to set some shit off take a pull of the blunt 
Hold the smoke till a muthafucka cough 
Chinky eyed sittin' in a hoopty ride 
Thinkin' to my SOMEBODY GONE' DIE!! 
Now which one of ya'll wanna catch the slugs 
I represent the unity of five heartless thugs 
And we take what we want be it money or drugs 
Can't nobody in da game even fuck with us 

It ain't nobody in this game that hold it down like us 
It ain't nobody in this game even close to us 
It ain't nobody in this game that'll bust like us 
It ain't nobody in this game nigga, game nigga 
It ain't nobody in this game that hold it down like us 
It ain't nobody in this game even close to us 
It ain't nobody in this game that'll bust like us 
It ain't nobody in this game nigga, game nigga</pre>
