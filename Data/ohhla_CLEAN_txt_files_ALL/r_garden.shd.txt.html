I didn't promise you a rose garden 
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be some rain sometimes
Watch out
I didn't promise you a rose garden (Yeah)
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be some rain sometimes
Listen, ok

[Verse 1]
When Abraham went to slash Issac
In a sense he baptized him 
Rabbi said don't trust in cash prizes
Same things that float your boat can capsize it
Tell the snakes they can take a hike like gas prices
No such things as half-way crooks or half righteous (Yeah)
Those who have eyes should act like it
To help the sightless seeking the light switch
To see in the night with, we leading the lifeless
Sometimes I just wanna play some shows, make some dough
Take it home, lay in my bed, and stay in my safety zone
But Cee-Lo said it best
I know too much and I owe too much to let it rest
Heard a voice say hey,
You never question when you get the blessings 
So don't get vexed when your life is stressed
And I promised I'll be with you no matter what the issue
But there will be some issues to address
Listen to the lady in the dress

I didn't promise you a rose garden 
Along with the sunshine (Uh huh)
There's gotta be some rain sometimes
I beg your pardon, I didn't promise you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain sometimes (Rain feels like this, check it)

[Verse 2]
I'm not in the zone, there's too much in the way
I weigh two bucks and if I had two slugs to spray
Like raa raa, Glenn Beck better duck like foie gras
Make shots poke his face like Gaga
But mama says forgive, so I give him that bar like a Mars then let him live
The missing saga continues, ranting
While my DJ's lamping like Green Lantern, sampling
Mansions? Nah, I ain't rich as Richard Branson
I'm King Kong meets Vince Vaughn and I play like a champion
I'm a Monday ball-e? Nah B, all week
Seven days of black power naps every forty eight half hours
That's twenty four starring Jack Bauer 
Can't cower when the rain falls
And it falls whether you're Gandhi or you're Adolf
Fall weather vendors always are way off
Make the call no rain delay
Play ball

I didn't promise you a rose garden (No) 
Along with the sunshine (Yeah)
There's gotta be some rain sometimes
I beg your pardon, I didn't promise you a rose garden (Uh huh, Uh huh)
Along with the sunshine (Yeah)
There's gotta be a little rain sometimes
I beg your pardon, I didn't promise you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain sometimes
I didn't promise you a rose garden 
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be some rain sometimes
I didn't promise you a rose garden 
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be some rain sometimes</pre>
