[Intro: Culture (Cappadonna)] 
Speak wit I'm em, I'ma watch this 
Ah ah ah, Cappa, Cappa 
Keep ya head to the sky 
(Keep ya head to the sky) 
Keep ya head up 
(Some things might just change, right? 
Keep ya head to the sky) 
Ya hear? 

[Cappadonna] 
Keep ya head to the sky, not for a mystery God 
But times are hard, take a look around 
Poor people treat ya brother as a equal 
Snuffin to be found on the ground 
These ain't the faces of a clown 
We the meak, God bless us whenever I speak 
My job is to teach, even if I drink, sex on the beach 
My mind is still in reach 
Never too far away from the pains of today 
And I say, comin in, my brothers gotta pass away 
Before we come together and pray, God is the way 
One of my sisters ran astray, jail with my people is the long hallway 
I see it like the eyes of Kunta Kente, we all gon' pay 
Children away from judgement day 
I respect Jah Selaseai, some things money can't buy 
And I tell you no lie, keep ya head to the sky 

[Chorus] 
Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head to the sky 
Some things money just can't buy 
Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head up 
Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head to the sky 

[Cappadonna] 
Only the flesh die, but the soul is forever 
I'm all for God, lovin the father, don't bother 
If you can't follow, mind's are hollow 
Never a thug, even though I sold drugs to survive 
It's all over, now I'm sober, I'm not a Roc-A-Fella or Jay-Hovah 
I'm just one soldier similar to P, I shed light 
G-O-D to the fullest, these thoughts are like bullets 
Hit you out the ordinary but don't worry 
I'm like the fort singin on the ferry 
The fairy Godfather from Park Hill 
Trynna to rip the face off a bill 
Now it's God will, like a ex-crack head said 
I'm like a fed, stuck in my head be the real information 
What out for Satan, waitin for you, hatin for you 
You a thug or a blood, get ya mine outta The Flood 
It's mine, I'ma flood, tryin to show y'all love 
I'm trynna rise above, ain't no time for crime 
These the bad days of time, under oath I can't lie 
And if I die, rhymes will spend you on right 
Be strong, keep ya head to the sky 

[Chorus] 
Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head to the sky 
Keep ya head to the sky (Whoa, whoa) 

[Cappadonna] 
Divine, I can see in ya mind 
Choppin wit ya mental, praises been due 
Thanks praise what I've been to, it's real 
Sign by the 'Ville, dude without a deal 
With God I'm survivin, it's not about drivin the Benz 
I got the ends, but I still need friends, so I can share my love 
Forget a club, brother push come to shove 
I'mma cry for my mother in the Hill, helped me to build 
On times are to ill, only she could make the black man chill 
Even not to steal, drivin through Park Hill 
Most of the time I was high, wildin for a small piece of the pie 
Me and Ghost sat down and ask ourselves why 
Did time in jail, when everythin else seemed to fail 
Most started the bail, it was hard to get the mail 
And separated from my seeds, now I'm tellin the tale 
Cuz in the fire I preceeded to burn 
Then my father bless me wit another turn 
He taught me to be more concerned 
Like a grandmother makin me learn 
At one sixty, that's how it it is 
It's not about show biz 
We deal in the orphanage, keep ya head to the sky 

[Outro: Cappadonna (Culture)] 
It's a privelage, keep ya head to the sky 
Keep ya head to the sky (Buck buck buck buck, whoa) 
Keep ya head to the sky (Why? Keep ya head to the sky) 
Keep ya head up (Whoa) Keep ya head to the sky 
(What? Buck buck buck buck buck) 
Jah Selaseai (Buck, you will make it) 
Keep ya head to the sky (You know you been 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you been partyin 
You been eatin pork, keep ya head to the sky 
What? Whoa) Blood to see, we out 
(Whoa, whoa, whoa) Gods who respect 
(Whoa, you, whoa) Check it out 
(Buck buck buck buck) You know 
No hatred, no hatred, go head 
(You made it) Just keep ya head to the sky 
Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head to the sky 
(Buck buck, whoa, whoa, whoa 
You know you made it, whoa 
Whoa, keep ya head up, whoa 
Keep ya head up high) Yo </pre>
