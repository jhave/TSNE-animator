You don't really wanna really, really
FunkDoobie for the nine seven shot
That's right
We got Cam on the mothership
Wicky-wicky-wicky, riding that cosmic funk
It's all about that money man
Hey Doobie, where you at?

[SonDoobie]
Hey, yo, what's that sound
Who freaks the funk, while Son grabs the pound
I don't count my loot-chee, Doobie gots the cool breeze
Box of jewelry, no hope is what your crew say
Blast mecha-uzi, blue eyes go rubies
?, off on my lonely
Doobie is to blame, so I'll be the sickest
Million red-eye, first-class plane, igging

If you ain't on it, well act on it
And my niggas celebrating, drink on it
Select-mode on the slam on it, now
To ba-ba-bank on it
If you ain't on it, well act on it
And my niggas celebrating, drink on it
Select-mode on the slam on it, now
To ba-ba-bank on it 

[Cam]
Wicky-wicky lights, Cam, Whup-whup!, action
Roll sound, let me get down, cuz Cam is in the back Son 
Doobie, so who be the niggas that really ride?
East, West, North, South-SIDE! tribe
True soldiers, we ain't out here just acting down
Cuz nigga all I hang around is Black and Brown
They crackind down, now brothers can't even hang
Four deep, without them calling us a gang
Cuz slang is what I speak, and bang is what the track do
How the fuck they locking niggas up for a tattoo?
And that do make a nigga want to smash
Homo-police, not po' white trash
Cash rule everything around us so, you know
That's the reason that the clout is for
Cuz yo, we all about moving and grooving now
With the high-pro glow, show and prove and how
You got to act on it

If you ain't on it, well act on it
And my niggas celebrating, drink on it
Select-mode on the slam on it, now
To ba-ba-bank on it
If you ain't on it, well act on it
And my niggas celebrating, drink on it
Select-mode on the slam on it, now
To ba-ba-bank on it

[SonDoobie]
Bo-bo-bo, I got your enchi-ai-yai
Mercedes drive by, Son sipping on the Malta
I shine in Heaven, now I'll try
High-five?, Son hikes to Hawa-i
See my legs cooped like ?
Twenty-four K, we parlay by night
We ride the funk, ?
Night trumps collide, apply the mind set
Come on, let's go to work
And let me see that body jerk
Girls twitch the middle, watch my chips triple
Latin lingo, connect ?
?, stash the loot in the Limo
Pistol through your bullet-proof, right through a window

If you ain't on it, well act on it
And my niggas celebrating, drink on it
Select-mode on the slam on it, now
To ba-ba-bank on itIf you ain't on it, well act on it
And my niggas celebrating, drink on it
Select-mode on the slam on it, now
To ba-ba-bank on it

A-Doobie-Doobie, yall
A-Doobie-Doobie
You don't really want to really, really
You don't really want to really, really</pre>
