Deadly ass verses 
We droppin this shit like bombs 
These niggas be talkin that shit 
And I wonder right up if they know they can't get none 
Deadly ass verses 
We droppin this shit for you ho's 
The villin is now in effect 
Hey yo pat nigga show em how you gunna flow 

The villin is chillin 
I'm plannin 
And I'm killin you niggas for sport 
And I'm tackin your life 
And I'm leaving you dead on the side 
Why cause I had no 
2 way shootin and killin them niggas for nothin 
See I don't know how in the fuck I got in it I really don't know 
Started up all of this shootin 
But I 
Know that 
I finish this so I pop 
I clip in my glock and I spray 
Through everyone I saw fall 
Bustin out of the club through the window with my bloody glock 
It in my draws 
Takin no prisoners 
Leavin no witnesses 
This nigga is body this fucking song 
I'm puttin my bloody glock in his mouth and he's rappin his lips so real my gun 
Scroovin and movin and groovin 
I blow and I lettin you now 
When I'm ruthless 
I shot with the villin is chillin 
And I'll kill em for nothin 
For real and my nigga 
And I ain't goin 
Bustin up out this 
Some sprints on a nigga that tried me 
But he didn't last 
He was writing a paycheck 
With his mouth 
His sissy couldn't cash 
Are you trick 
Niggas be thinkin the villins a sucku 
But I don't give a fuck 
When I bite my bottom lip you bitches better duck 
Any mother fucker that defies me will end up riding in a hearse 
I don't give a single cause on a deadly fuck 
That's why I wrote this deadly verse 

Deadly ass verses 
We droppin this shit like bombs 
These niggas be talkin that shit 
And I wonder right up if they know they can't get none 
Deadly ass verses 
We droppin this shit for you ho's 
The gangsta is now in effect 
Yo my nigga show them how you gunna flow 

I'm bustin they flow 
And ya know 
When I'm goin 
I love when I come with that wicked style 
Robbin they killas 
Since I can remember 
Cause see I was born as a wicked child 
Comin up out of the grave 
Nothin could save 
You wanna start and get bucked 
I'm rippin and flippin that shotgun 
I'm back on attackin 
I really don't give a fuck 
Smokin that chronic 
And feelin bionic 
I'm smoked straight out off in another time 
I might be insane 
I'm keepin my game 
I feel like I'm goin straight out of my mind 
Pull out my nine 
Cock it one time 
Put it right up on the side of my head 
Should I let me live 
Or should I pull 
The trigger and fill 
Myself full of lead 
Am I really ready for suicide 
I know and I wanna just go there 
But if it's not what I think it is 
What if they wont let me flow there 
What if they wont let me keep me your number 
Outside when I'm ready to fall now 
I guess I just gotta straight come 
And drop you a bone when it's time to all out 
I'm trippin and clippin and flippin 
The niggas that wanna ride up and get bucked out 
Bitches be talkin that shit 
But they suckin my dick 
In the end they get fucked out 
Niggas that fuck with they G 
They must love to get haled off in hearses 
They don't understand I'm the man 
And I'm droppin these deadly ass verses 

Deadly ass verses 
We droppin this shit like bombs 
These niggas be talkin that shit 
And I wonder right up if they know they can't get none 
Deadly ass verses 
We now we talk on the left up 
My nigga lets flip the script 
And rock this funky shit together 

Cant nobody fuck with us 
Niggas that know they can't get none 
But what if they think that they can 
Why don't they run up and try to come get some 
Deadly ass verses we droppin these lyrics for all of you ho's 
The villin is now in effect 
Hey yo pat nigga show em how your gunna flow 

I'm poppin my clip in my glock 
An I'm bustin up all of my councils 
Til I see you fallin 
I'm rappin out of this thing 
Cause I'm hiding my bloody glock deep inside my draws 
And I'm leaving you all out 
And this is for all of my bitches I have picked up in a heist 
I'm am a bad nigga 
Stoppin the flow and irruptin 
And I'm lettin you know I'm nothin nice 

Cant nobody fuck with us 
Niggas that know they can't get none 
But what if they think that they can 
Why don't they run up and try to come get some 
Deadly ass verses we droppin these lyrics for all of you ho's 
The gangsta is now in effect 
Yo my nigga show them how your gunna flow 
I'm killin and stealin for money 
I'm keepin my nine up 
I'm somebody's face 
If they move I'm gunna blast 
And I'm kicken they ass 
And I'm takin they shit 
But they catch me a murder case 
Niggas that know 
They can't fuck with the gangsta 
If they do I kill them and leave them for dead 
I watch cause I'm on top with my glock 
I don't stop 
I just pop 
And rake shop 
When I droppin a deadly verse </pre>
