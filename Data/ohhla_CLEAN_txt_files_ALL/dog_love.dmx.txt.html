[DMX] {Americe and Janice harmonizing}
Uh (Owww) uh oh
It's for the ladies (Ha ha)
Strickly for the ladies (One more time)
Hey, that's all this is
Uh uh (Uh uh)

[DMX]
She was five seven one twenty-five
Man, loose lips with those thighs (Uh)
Couldn't just let her walk by (right), I ain't a thirsty nigga
But right about now my throat was gettin real dry
Shoo this shit, had to be the cutest bitch
I seen in a long time and I don't do this shit, like
Runnin up on hoes, what up ma, I'm X
Cause you know how this goes, come on ma, I'm X
We just chill, sat and talk to the first light
And for the first time I didn't fuck on the first night
And it was aight, shorty was a thorobred
Like "Belly", we ain't fuck, she just gave me head, for real

[Chorus]
(Janice)
From the time that the sun is up
Till the stars show up
It really doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter babe
There's no love like the dog love
There's no love, it's dog love

(Amerie)
No matter what, I'll hold you down
Nobody else will come around
Don't even matter cause
There's no love like the dog love
I got my dog love, got my dog love baby
(There's no love, it's dog love)

[DMX]
I run with shorty, pass off the gun to shorty
Do whatever gots to be done with shorty, straight like that
When I hit her like "I'll be right back"
Yo, I'll be right back, ain't no bullshittin, I'll be right back
She got a nigga catchin feelings, I'm a street nigga hard body
But, she got me catchin feelings
Man, those eyes, those lips
Be like damn, those thighs, those hips
She like "blam", make a nigga have to touch somethin (For real)
Not necessarily fuck somethin, as long as I touch somethin (For real)
A nigga blood boil when I see another nigga holla (WHAT)
Don't make me have to pop a nigga in his fuckin collar

[Chorus]

[DMX]
Aiyyo, shit is goin to smooth (Uh)
Since Stella got a new groove (Yeah) it's like we got somethin to prove
We gon' make it, rain or shine
My heart is yours and yours is mine
Like Eve said, "Love Is Blind" (Come on), right about now
I can't see shit cause you always on my mind
Been like that, since I met her, had to have her so I went to get her
But I'm a dog so I didn't sweat her
And it wasn't bout the cheddar, I don't trick
I got two things for bitches, couple of jokes and some dick
Yeah the kid talk slick but that's not what I'm about
We got dog love and me and shorty ridin it out, we out

[Chorus]

[Janice and Amerie]
All I want is you in my life
All I got is you in my life
All I need is you in my life
So I know I'm gonna be all right
