Tell my mother I'm sorry I never meant to hurt her
And even when I did I never meant to take it further
Tell my father I love him Dot dot etcetera
He use to give me advice like a plethora
I tried to find myself but I'se your replica
I mean I only tried to be what you never was
Tell my older brother I'm bad at being a brother
I know I never told you just how highly I think  of ya
Tell my grandmother man she's always been a friend of me
 I would've visited more if I wasn't in to me
Tell tre I think his mother is an ass hole
When you get older you might understand how that goes
Tell the hood I left not for greed or wealth
I did it for my own sanity to keep my health
I tried to bring a few with me hoping we can cash in
But all they said is I ain't do it in a timely fashion
Tell music she saved me when shit was adverse
My first love I'd give my life so she could have hers
Tell my friends each one they taught me how to be one
I owe to them part of everything I've become
Tell fame I ain't want it naw keep it a hundred
I tried my best to go and get it but the nigga fronted (so)
I lie dormant Living threw torment
Tell cops I got warrants I don't warrant 
Tell the therapist Look I never thought I'd get here
Somebody ask love why she ain't want to live here
So in this place there's a lota pride Anybody thinking they know me
I apologize
Grandpa is 80 plus Still being strong
Tell the fake niggas keep on keeping on
Faithfully tell everybody who hated me
Basically all it ever did was motivated me
They say I'm difficult so to put it simply
Tell the world I never cared it was against me
Tell god to be there in case I fall
Tell the fans I never jipped them I always gave them my all
Tell my girl She put me threw it
But if I had to go threw it with anybody
I'm thankful it's her
Tell every member of my family
For to long I hid behind my own insanity it got me caught up
And somebody tell currency I chased him to the death
I thought I'd catch the nigga till I ran outa breath
Tell my bruises I'm fine I'm good I normally heal quick
Tell the rain come down I need to feel it
I told the nigga give me a hand but he wouldn't
I kept telling myself I can't
Until I couldn't
If niggas want to kill me tell em I already died
Tell anybody that will listen i tried
Till the water ran dry tell the water get the fuck out my eyes
Tell the crust it taste great but I'd much rather the pie
Ask success what I have to do to succeed
Then tell my twin brothers I look at them like my seeds
Ya'll with be the mouths I feed
If a nigga ever tell me how to get rid myself of some of this greed
I tell em that I'm grown really I ain't finish growing
Look tell failure I ain't want to get to know em
Tell the stick up kids to come and get me
Tell the stereotypes I tried them shits on they didn't fit me
Tell who ever I wronged I apologize
They tell me though there bumps in the road
But still I gotta ride they tell me I got a lotta pride
I tell them how the fuck you gone tell me what I got inside
Then they wanna lecture a nigga tell me life is what you make it
That's when I tell them I beg to differ</pre>
