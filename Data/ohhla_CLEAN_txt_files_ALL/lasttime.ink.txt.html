Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Last time I felt like this I swear I was on one
Last time I felt like this I swear nigga on one

I be on some shit they ain't ready for
Pull up in the world, they ain't ready for
With a bunch of bad bitches, they ain't ready for
See high they get, they ain't ready for

[Verse 1]
Come see for yourself, I turn up, don't need no help
With a bunch of bad bitches trying to wild out
Girl so bad, put her on time out
Looking for the real, you can find out
Tell her there's a party back in my house
If I can't chose I can parlor
I ain't sitting in the back, I don't give a fuck, no
Shake that ass with the basic, hope I don't forget it to the waitress
It's trouble in the air, I can taste it
Bottle in my hand, I'm a face it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It's Mustard on the beat ho, and anything bang, no reload
A nigga in the game, no chick ho
Tear it like the motherfucking cico
Now everything automatic, walk in this bitch, if I want it I grab it
Going in like a nigga never had it
Walk on green like on motherfucking caddy
Nowhere in my range, not in my car, get out of my lane
I'm sitting at the bar, drink away my pain before I go insane

[Chorus]

[Outro]
They ain't ready for, yeah, they ain't ready for
It's Kid Ink, they ain't ready for
Alumni, they ain't ready for
Ill Will, they ain't ready for
Hardhead, they ain't ready for
DJ Tech, they ain't ready for
Devin Cruise, they ain't ready for</pre>
