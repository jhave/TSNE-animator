Hey
This is the beat that make you shake your rump
That make your booty go ba-bump, ba-bump
It's that beat that make ya bump ya bump (ohh)

Yea, just do what you want
Up in the club just do what you want
Get into it baby, get off your stump
Girlies on the dance floor wiggle your fronts
We got rhymes that always triumph
This is the beat that make ya bump ya bump
Shake your rump rump shaky shake your rump

Its that beat that make ya bump ya bump

And only gettin' little booties little bit of hump (thanks)
And if you got boobies baby keep 'em all plump
And if you got blunts s-smoke 'em if you want
Got a 6 - 4 get pump it in your trunk
Cause we got biz that been boomin like... (ohh)

Yea nigga don't front
Cause this beat got you running just like Gump
(run Forest)

Bump ya bump

And if you got money fellas keep it like Trump
Fellas, huh
Whip out your money
And go get a Honey
And buy what she want
Take her to the ball and try to get her drunk
But if the girl's UGLY
Then get drunk

This that beat that make ya get crunk
It's that beat that make ya bump ya bump (ohh)
I'll give you what ya want

(Ye-eh-eh, Ye-eh-eh, Ye-eh-eh, Ye-eh-eh...)

That's what we gave ya cause that's what you need
B to the E to the P make ya bump (ooh)
I'll give you what you want

I come with rhymes that are dangerous like stunts (yea)
Keep the girls screaming just like trumpets (yea)
Keep the hits from smashing like pumpkins
Get ya drunk like it's too, too much consumption (ohh)
Throw the assume, there's no room for assumption
We the crew that keep the funk just funking
The bump just ba-bump, ba-bump, ba-bumping (ohh)

We give ya what you want
Some that thing lil some one of
Just like your mamma nigga this beats Chunky
Look imma be real blunt
We punch up cops, no, we don't get punk'd
Never stagged near the dragon, keep it on jump (ohh)
If you're askin' it's the year of the Monkey

So ba bump ba bump (ohh)

[Fergie]
Do what you want
(Up in the club just do what you want)
Give it to me baby, yea, get off your stump
Brothers on the floor just wiggle your front
Cause we got rhymes that always triumph, huh
Got blunts s-smoke 'em if you want
This that beat that make ya, you know the rest

[Will.i.am]
It's that beat that make ya bump ya bump (ohh)

That's what we gave ya cause that's what you need
B to the E to the P make ya bump (ooh)

This is bumping, bumping, (oh) bumping, bumping
When it's bumping in your trunk, it takes over me
(This is bumping, bumping) and this is real (bumping, bumping)
