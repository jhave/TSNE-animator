Cool, calm collective
My perspective is to analyze every situation
The family die, put my mind in isolation
I be facin' nightmares
'Fraid 'cause the dead, yo, they sayin' that I'm right there
Tried to wake but I can't see where I'm at
Finaly wake then I'm relaxin' on a dime sack
The crimes I did way back in my mind is played back
over and over. That's the reason that I'm never sober
Twenty-two, the skinny, broke mummy man
It's all good now-a-days, I got money plans
The time I'm wastin' up in this occupation
got me tokin' bones in my crib, steady pacin'
Look for my homies, but they already gettin' high
Caught in the struggle, maintainin', tryin' to get by
Read' to die, when it happens, recognize I told ya
Go all out, even if you're coma soldiers
I wake up and sleep wit' a L,
write rhymes wit' a L but never take a L
So let my mind start to elevate
Supportions of divorce shit got the playas huddled screamin' forfeit

Let my mind start to elevate
Generate thoughts that penetrate. ("Stimulated dome.")
Let my mind start to elevate
Generate thoughts that penetrate. ("Stimulated dome.")
Let my mind start to elevate
Generate thoughts that penetrate. ("Stimulated dome.")
Let my mind start to elevate. ("Eleveate, elevate, elevate...")

No retreat, no surrender. My mind's caught up in this blender
Don't fear contenders. Them the greatest pretenders
Dear Momma, mend and build this determination
'cause your my latest, my latest, my greatest inspiration!
Some try to decease the kid
You got the pie, but I only want a piece of it
Teach the kid? I learned my lessons in the school yard
and never walked around thinkin' that I'm too hard
It's too hard to just chill and keep my game strong
If it's on, then it's on, nigga. Bring it on
Whatever happened, it just happened, yo. The end of that
If I survive then I'm lied on the chunky plaque
Think of my Momma, tired after workin' hard
There's a lot of shit that forced me not to worship God
The creator, the creator of all my fellows
Main thing, the creator of all these ghettos
Let go, my minds twisted like Keith
No disbelief, I got my eyes open on the streets
Where's the beef?. Yo, I'm comin' as the butcher
Yo, shook ya? Here on the shelf is where I put 'cha

Let my mind start to elevate
Generate thoughts that penetrate. ("Stimulated dome.")
Let my mind start to elevate
Generate thoughts that penetrate. ("Stimulated dome.")
Let my mind start to elevate
Generate thoughts that penetrate. ("Stimulated dome.")
Let my mind start to elevate. ("Eleveate, elevate, elevate...")
Let my mind start to elevate
Generate thoughts that penetrate. ("Stimulated dome.")
Let my mind start to elevate
Generate thoughts that penetrate. ("Stimulated dome.")
Let my mind start to elevate
Generate thoughts that penetrate. ("Stimulated dome.")
Let my mind start to elevate. ("Eleveate, elevate, elevate...")
("Stimulated dome.")
("Stimulated dome.")
("Stimulated dome.")
