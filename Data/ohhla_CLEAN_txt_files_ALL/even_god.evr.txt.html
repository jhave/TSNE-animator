[Chorus One: Everlast]
Ridin round town, got a pocket full of dough
Where I'll wind up, even God don't know
I take it just as fast and as far as it'll go
Ridin round town, got a pocket full of dough
Where I'll wind up, even God don't know

[Everlast]
Aiyyo it's hard knock livin doin hard luck time
Tryin to make a dime still my only crime
A man died tryin to circumcise my shine
Buck your gun kiddo, and I'll buck mine~!
Cash walk the line, police are the swine
But knowledge is refined by the wise and divine
And I can break it down for the dumb and the blind
Unnatural acts, to actual facts
Like cats that move packs don't never pay tax
You ain't lie, boy you need to relax
You leave a five like a junkie leaves tracks
A habit needs a home like a monkey needs backs

[Chorus Two: Everlast]
Pistol in my lap, got the pedal to the flo'
The whiskey in the flask and a head full of blow
You got heaven up above, got hell down below
Pistol in my lap, got the pedal to the flo'
Where I'll wind up, even God don't know

[Everlast]
I need a hard-headed woman for a cold-hearted man
Never seen it comin, that's just part of the plan
Work the hidden hand, walk forbidden land
Do the best I can once shit hits the fan
An hour's worth of sand, supply and demand
Get high as you can, the power of a grand
Two in the bush is worth one in the hand
Could cower in the van, or burst into battle
Back in the saddle, the kid don't rattle
Don't play me, up the creek with no paddle
We don't snitch while you bitches just tattle
Poppin off at the lip gets you tipped like cattle

[Chorus Three: Everlast]
Eyes full of hate, got a heart full of love
And you're the only woman that I ever dreamed of
I get high as I can fly then I cry like a dove
Eyes full of hate, got a heart full of love
And you're the only woman that I ever dreamed of
