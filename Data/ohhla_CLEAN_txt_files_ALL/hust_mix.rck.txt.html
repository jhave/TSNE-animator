[Busta Rhymes speaking over Intro]
Hey yo, Rick Ross
I had the wild coke connect from niggaz from South America
My Guyanese niggaz used to hit me off, ha ha ha ha
Flipmode bitch, yeah
Busta Rhymes, Rick Ross
Now I think you niggaz know what it is
See when the Reaganomics of it was poppin' off
We used to get that inconceivable pop
Rick Ross, go 'head and talk to 'em

[Verse 1 - Rick Ross]
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with, I'm the fuckin' boss
Seven forty-five, white on white that's fuckin' Ross
I cut 'em wide, I cut 'em long, I cut 'em fat (What)
I keep 'em comin' back (What), we keep 'em comin' back
I'm in the distribution, I'm like Atlantic
I got them motherfuckers flyin' 'cross the Atlantic
I know Pablo, Noriega, the real Noriega
He owe me a hundred favors
I ain't petty nigga, we buy the whole thang
See most of my niggaz really still deal cocaine
My roof back, my money rides
I'm on the pedal, show you what I'm runnin' like
When they snatch black I cry for a hundred nights
He got a hundred bodies, servin' a hundred lifes

[Hook with Busta Rhymes ad-libs]
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev-everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev-everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm, everyday I'm

[Verse 2 - Busta Rhymes]
I'm on this shit too, I know ya can't believe
Just call me claustrophobia I leave no room to breathe
While other niggaz done lived see I create a scene
Then I get up on my grind and I hustle to another level to another extreme
Amphetamines, weed the empire that I'm building
Even got a coke connect through Pablo Escobar's children
Heard what I said bitch, Pablo Escobar's children
They call me whenever they manufacture the coke shipment
Whenever there is a drought and we need to place an order
I holla at Manuela Escobar, Pablo's daughter
From Columbia through Bahamas, Florida Keys border
Yes, the hunger for enchilada gets hotter please call her
She gets me coke that makes bodies numb once ya fingers in it
So white, the coke got a sparkle like she got crystals in it
Look, out of town my gangsta's bubblin'
See I will flip and sell you any drug cuz I be hustlin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We never steal cars, but we deal hard
Whip it real hard whip it whip it real hard
I caught a charge, I caught a charge
Whip it real hard, whip it whip it real hard
Ain't bout no funny shit still bitches and business
I'm on my money shit still whippin' them Benzs
Major league who catchin' because I'm pitchin'
Jose Canseco just snitchin' because he's finish
I feed 'em steriods to strengthen up all my chickens
They flyin' over Pacific to be specific
Triple C's you know it's back we holdin' sacks
So nigga go on rat, run and tell 'em that
Mo' cars, mo' hoes, mo' clothes, mo blows
