[Hook- Lil Romeo]
Whoodihoop, whoodihoop
Whoodihoop, whoodihoop
Whoodihoop, whoodihoop

Lean back, lean back

Where them lil soldiers at? (lean back)
Lean back, lean back
Lean Back, lean back
Whoodihoop, whoodihoop
Whoodihoop, whoodihoop
Whoodihoop, whoodihoop

[Verse One- Lil Romeo]
Now its the one and only young kid in his biz
And I ain't gotta lie man you know who I'm is
I'm fresh, some call my clean iouno how to dance
But, I know how to lean in my P Miller pants
(Oh) I'm the sheriff and you in my town
You know how I get down, I don't play around
So get loose shawty, and show me what you all about
It's ya birthday shawty, you can blow da candles out
(Whoodihoop) thats how we lean down south
Lil one we can take it to the house
You got game, yeah we can take it to the hoop
The rich boyz up in here, you better let them boys through
(uh) I'm like scrappy, you don't want no problems
My dad right here, y'all don't want no drama

[Hook- Lil Romeo]
Whoodihoop, whoodihoop
Whoodihoop, whoodihoop
Whoodihoop, whoodihoop
Where them boys at
Where them girls at
Where them boys at
Where them girls at
Lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
Where them lil soldiers at? (lean back)
Where them lil soldiers at? (lean back)
Lean back, lean back
Lean Back, lean back
Whoodihoop, whoodihoop
Whoodihoop, whoodihoop
Whoodihoop, whoodihoop

[Verse Two- Lil Romeo]
I make you lean like joe and terror squad
You got on p miller, throw ya hands in the sky
I got bucks like milwauke
Hit me on the cell phone, holla back on the walky talky
The new no limit, yeah we hot
I might be young, but I got this rap thang on lock
Yeah you know it's my time to shine
Throw me a ball, I hit a home run like barry bonds
If you in elementary juniour high or high school
Get it crunk, wild out wit the crew
If you ain't scared, say you ain't scared
We play tackle football with no pass
If you a soldier, say you a soldier
The new no limit up in here, I thought I told ya
After high school, I'm goin straight to the pros
Romeo got game, take it to the flo

Where them lil soldiers at? (lean back)
Where them lil soldiers at? (lean back)
Lean back, lean back
