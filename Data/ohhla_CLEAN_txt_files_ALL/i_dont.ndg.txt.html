	[Chorus - Nate Dogg x2]
	I don't wanna hurt no more
	I don't wanna hurt no more
	I don't wanna hurt no more
	I, but the rain keeps comin down

[Nate Dogg]
Man I been thinkin lately
About the way the world just be changin
Is it a sin to be chasin paper
I can't count the niggas dyin lately
It's the grave or incarceration
I know you hurt but you can't replace em
You go and dig a hole then erase em
You just created a smaller nation
A jail cell is all that's waitin
Look at all the progress you're makin
I really hope you're kinda patient
You facin 25 no probation
2 for 1 is multiplication
You're freedom is all their takin
Is it best to be dead or pacin
All cos you couldn't take it

	Chorus (x2)

[Danny "Butch" Means]
How can I concentrate
With all the problems that I face
I often ask myself if there's a place 
where I can get away (Where I can get away)
I keep my head to the sky
And try to maintain my pace
If I don't then I'm gone
Somebody gone take my place
No need to go too fast
Cos I know a little time it takes
But my situation's bad
I'll be jackin soon at this rate
I ain't tryin to make you mad
It's a plain and simple fact you face
If you're broke you hurt most
From all the bullshit you take

	Chorus (x2)

[Nate Dogg]
Lately I've been feelin like givin up (Don't give up)
The pain inside makes me wanna reach out and touch
Someone, anyone who feels that I ain't been hurt enough
You best duck or get stuck
Cos man I been hurtin for months

No more, no more, no more, no more
I've been hurtin a while
No more, no more, no more, no more
And I don't wanna hurt no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
Don't wanna hurt no more
But the rain keeps comin down
