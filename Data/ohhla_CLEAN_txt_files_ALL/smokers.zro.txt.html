[Z-Ro]
I'sa rude boy like a domino, and finally cause it rolls
Soar like an eagle, from the porch smoke in my nose
And I bust it down upon the center, and feel it up with cess
And start fill licking roll up ganja, now smokers got test
Gangsta smoker, times is not joker
Ignite the kill, I wanted to puff and they taught me
One to one original feeling, watch me take the fondour
I'ma walk up to the sweet house, and start to rap on the door

I'ma get a box of phillys from out the sto', and come right back
Then I'ma roll a philly, fat as a finger and light that
Lemon lime hydro and regular pine, you know I like that
Under of the influence of sticky, there's no need to fight back
Cause I love it when I be lifted, all of my gears be done shifted
One deep in the rental car going off, because I'm talented and gifted
Scooping up nothing but playas, and we're thinking the same
Nothing but flipping and sipping, and running a train on Mary Jane
Love it mayn, rolling em and blowing em all day
Posted up at the Red Booth Inn, smelling good in the hallway
With a wet towel up under the do', but that ain't enough to stop the do-do
But like the Po-Yo I'm about to rep the logo, smoke on in a tinted out fo' do'

[Hook]
Nothing but, swisher smoking tonight
Anything that you want from me, gotta wait till I get high
I'm not capping but, only sticky green is on my mind
But if you wanna match your sweet, well I think we can compromise

[Z-Ro]
I'ma huff and I'm gon puff, cause I done made it a habit
From point A to point B and even to point C, I'm searching for some cabbage
Hold up look up in the sky, is it a bird is it a plane
Naw it's slim and brown, and smelling so lovely it's Mary Jane
I'll admit it I'ma fiend, for nothing but coedine and killer green
With a 24 hour lean, I'm always smoking on the scene
Everybody wanna put me to the test, I'm just trying to ease the tension and stress
Inhale but I gotta let it go, congested in my chest
In an attempt to bust a lung, hydro ponics got me sprung
Going broke behind this woman, and willing to spend all my funds
I gotta get a fat sack for one double O, but lifted that's fa sho though
And like the Po-Yo I'm about to rep the logo, smoke on in a tinted out fo' do'

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
I'm lighter than Al, trying to smoke myself into another dimension
Please light up that there, cause I really need to calm my nerves I be tripping
That's why I gotta stay smoking, but to keeping my balance is really a challenge
And I'm violently choking, hit the coat drop 85 mo' when I say fatter than a fat pack
Maybe that would be R-A to the N-K, everyday all day
Stimulating my mind, Guerilla Maab one deep and I'm one of a kind
You better not try to crush that love, better pass if you wanna live puff-puff give
On the cool I'm stuck in my buzz, I could poke on golds with red hair punk cause I'm blowing kill
Even if I'm on paper for pulling a caper, I gotta be blowing still
And you know it's real, burning kill
With a wet towel up under the do', but that there ain't enough to stop the do-do
And like the Po-Yo I'm about to rep the logo, smoke on in a tinted out fo' do'
