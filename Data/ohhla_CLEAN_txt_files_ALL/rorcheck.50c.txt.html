(Intro)
Some niggas just wanna smoke
Some niggas wanna smoke niggas
Some niggas sell coke
Some niggas sellin dope nigga

We all hood, different pedigrees
Now check out my melody
You fuck around I catch a felony
Now check out my melody

(Chorus)
Since a little nigga I been on my own
Me I hold the chrome you don't think so
respect it or check it nigga

That shorty shit is over now I'm grown
Me I'm full blown, you don't think so
respect it or check it nigga

(Verse 1)
I don't know if I'm worse when I'm rich or when I'm broke nigga
Same attitude you got it go head smoke nigga
I'm fucking with a blonde bitch I got my own fragrance
Powered by 50 goddamn it I think I made it
I tried to keep it basic they wanna complicate shit
The feds on my phone that's why I don't ever say shit
Portray being a friend to me and I'll make you a memory
That .40 Cali barrel get to smoking like a chimney 
Niggas sick of pussy shit and me I'm just the remedy
O 3 get rich nigga you remember me? 

(Interlude)
hey yo pull that back, man!
hey yo play that again man, you know what I'm saying

(Intro)

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
I don't know if I'm worse when I'm rich or when I'm broke nigga
Same attitude you got it go head smoke nigga
I'm fucking with a blonde bitch I got my own fragrance
Powered by 50 goddamn it I think I made it
I tried to keep it basic they wanna complicate shit
The feds on my phone that's why I don't ever say shit
Portray being a friend to me and I'll make you a memory
That .40 Cali barrel get to smokin like a chimney 
Niggas sick of pussy shit and me I'm jus the remedy
O 3 Get Rich nigga you remember me? 
Shorty rock her hips she get to looking like a entree
Bad bitch fat ass bouncing it like Beyonce
She saying I'm a a Diva, I'm a, I'm a a Diva
I'm a fuck her and leave her nigga I don't need her
I was born alone I die alone I be in the zone
Bitches won't leave me alone, now that my money long! 

2 x (Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I pull the hammer out and spank niggas
I peep your style you got sugar in your tank nigga
Don't fuckin' wink at me
I blend in with the best of them, shooters and robbers
I'm on that Will-I-Am shit, I black ya eye for bloggin 
What the fuck is the problem? Violence isn't the answer
I split your fuckin' head then get jammed up

Why did you call the cops? Why didn't you say I'm hot?
It's been six years I been here on top
You act like I'm a average nigga, spittin a average flow
Fuckin with average bitches like everywhere that I go
I'm not focused on hoes I'm focusing on the dough
And I won't talk to you after my next album blow

(Chorus)

(Outro)
Rest In Peace to Michael Jackson
You niggas need me man
I might have to start moonwalkin
Couple dance moves and shit
Write me some shit call it Billie Jean is my lover
I'm back nigga
Why you so quiet
Niggas know it's summertime I'm all over the place nigga
And you know when you see me: I'm strizzapped

Oh shit nigga!</pre>
