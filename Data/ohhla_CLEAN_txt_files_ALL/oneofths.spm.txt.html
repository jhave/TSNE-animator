[Ayana]
Think it's gonna be one of those nights
one of those nights again
Think it's gonna be one of those nights
smoked out with my friends

[SPM]
We from the H home boy
Hustle Town Texas
A.K.A  Screwston,  O's and X's
And you plexas leavin in stretchers
Ya'll aint deep enough
you need to call up your extras
Hater hurter, the mic I'ma murda
Swanger and a swerver
with a jar that say gurba
I aint the biggest, Im the baddest
Servin dope addicts, bad temper, bad
manners, and bad habit's
It dont matter muthafucka, if you need it
I can send them to the valley pick âem up and retrieve âem
Association by affiliation
about to hit 200 on the freeway when you see me racing

[Ayana]
Think it's gonna be one of those nights
one of those nights again
Think it's gonna be one of those nights
smoked out with my friends
Think it's gonna be one of those nights
one of those nights again
Think it's gonna be one of those nights
hand on my Mack-10

[Uchie]
In the hilla, with my killa
blowin hogwa
See me comin in the Benz or the Jaguar
And them niggas say âUch thats a bad car.â
Young gangsta but heading like Haggler
And tell them money aint the answer to your problem
Got the monkey on my back and I cant drop âem
In the city where the cop can get wiggy
Everybody do this to the piggy
If you want to sip one the remy
I appreciate the love that you give me
So tonight, I'ma chill and write lyrics
And smoke dro with my girl-friends parents
FOLLOW ME!

Think it's gonna be one of those nights

I'm a Screwston sipper
microphone ripper
I'ma come home with my shirt full of glitter
Jump my 45er
race car driver
Smoke so much kill I got no more saliva
Love for the South sider and the North sider
I might accidently get you for your lighter
I'ma street fighter
some dont like the
boy that got more snow flake than Tony the Tiger
I'ma get a Viper
who wants the Benz?
I'ma represent  S.U.C. and Dead Endz
Fall in the place
fine hos in my face
Peace to Engrando and the D-H
Love for the East side
And the South West
Ecko on my chest
and I sit on the Guess
Packin my pump
pass me the blunt
Fuck goin gold
Im just trying to win the Cannibus cup
WHAT???

[Ayana]
Think it's gonna be one of those nights
one of those nights again
Think it's gonna be one of those nights

Think it's gonna be one of those nights
one of those nights again
Think it's gonna be one of those nights
hand on my Mack-10</pre>
