Album:  Both Sides of the Brain
Song:   Proto Culture
Typed by: webmaster@hieroglyphics.com

Chorus: Let me tell you about the Proto Culture 
If you don't know the culture, here's the whole structure
We've had enough of the lackluster-trust us 
We get the kind of games you can't rent at Blockbuster 
KU: Game related, raise it bit by bit 
Yo D, link up the cable we'll go hit for hit 
Phantasma plasma particle beam means I have ya 
on the run-the rendered effects hot like magnas 

Del: I play games by Capcom with a power glove strapped on O
n any platform, I don't spend my dough on Phat Farm
Video games, I got many to play 
Before my life expires; fufill my desires 

KU: Mastering your hardest boss 
Shattering all stars across 
Ain't hard to cross the finish line 
Floatin' on Daytona 
Wex, Gex or Kloana, we get em all at cost 
RPG, Platform we transform like Macross 

Del: Rival schools, Batsu 
Purchase you ought to 
It came with one free CD, it's like I bought two 
I hope they make part II for Dreamcast 
Cause games I've seen in mags, you won't believe they have! 

KU: Getting callouses turning over asteroids 
Graviton bombs destroyed 
Getting moms annoyed 
Now I'm hacking Nightmare Creatures 
Their features splattered across the screen 
It gets more clean each year 

Del: I remember my homie Ed Coats had the most 
A Colecovision-every week I'd visit 
Playing Donkey Kong Jr., Venture, Rock and Rope
Games I thought was dope 
While my moms was watching soaps 

KU: I'm on the next level 
I got a double barrel shotgun in the Doomworld 
Waiting on the next devil 
Armor's low-check the arsenal 
Rupture the main conductor playin Disruptor 

Del: I remember Ninja Gaiden 
Finished finally 
With Ramone wouldn't answer the phone 
This was before getting blown 
I own the first Nintendo Power 
With the maps of Zelda Help me conquer in an hour 

Chorus: Let me tell you about the Proto Culture 
If you don't know the culture, here's the whole structure
We've had enough of the lackluster-trust us 
We get the kind of games you can't rent at Blockbuster
(2X) 

Del: Hey KU you know my SEGA collection is massive
Got all the past hits and classics 
Herzog Zwei now Panzer Zwei 
Originality that made me a fan today 

KU: It's Pandemonium-it's like Toys R Us 
Flippin the next Saturn game brings out the boys in us 
It's poisonous 
Taking out the boys in blue in Grand Theft Auto, 
Snatch a Rolls Royce to use 

Del: Yeah, I'll admit Playstation improved 
Come visit Feudal Japan with me and Tenchu 
Bushido Blade 2 with sword play so accurate 
Mega Man Legends but I had to buy a map for it. 

KU: I fence Hyo to get a Neo-Geo 
For Samurai 64 in full rendered splendor 
Rival counter and enter my sword in his innards 
My joint was being Leonardo wuppin' on Splinter 

Del: I gotta get Xenogears-that's the type of game that relieves my fears 
Get it from overseas to here 
I gotta get Psychic Force 
Authentic arcade that I can endorse 
They got me liking imports 

KU: I'll need to be at the next E3, 
What's the next CD I need to see 
Me and D signing checks 
Let's float overseas, mingle with game companies 
Giving tips to Capcom and Sega-you can't front on these 

Del: To anyone who knew me better 
Know I chose Saturn first Cause it's 2-D heaven 
Bernie Stolar dropped the ball with the RAM cartridge 
X-men Vs. Streetfighter could've expanded the market 

KU: Marvel Vs. Capcom-beyond fathom 
Tell the truth, Playstation ain't ready to have em 
Come on I'll bring the onslaught
Alpha and Omega
Khaos Unique brought to you by SEGA. 

Chorus: Let me tell you about the Proto culture 
If you don't know the culture, here's the whole structure
We've had enough of the lackluster-trust us 
We get the kind of games you can't rent at Blockbuster
