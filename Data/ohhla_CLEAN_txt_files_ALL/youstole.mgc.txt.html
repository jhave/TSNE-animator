It's mc magic
Magic city part 2
You stole my heart girl
I just wanna let you know
There's nobody in this world
That could ever take your place
Baby I just wanna let you know
There's nobody in this world that could ever take your place

Quiero darte todo mi amor
Me robastes el corazon
Voy a estar contigo hasta el final
Baby I just wanna let you know
There's nobody in this world that could ever take your place

Girl I'm trying to love you but you just won't let me
I wanna touch every inch of your body slow and sexy
Conversation love jams or whatever
Tell me what you hide in the corners of your mind
Turn off your world girl and we could live inside a dream
Like a movie of the sexiest things you have ever seen
Don't mean to cross the line or even think I'd disrespect
But I'm burning with a passion my mind is in a wreck
And when you look into my eyes it's like a magnet
Pulling me convincing me that girl I gotta have it
Maybe I'm trippin maybe you don't even notice me but then you
Smile and once again your taking over me
Que tu quieres que te diga mas intenso cada dia
No puedo resisitir la fantasia
It's like my veins are full of fire can't stop it
You got the key to all my dreams so please unlock it

Quiero darte todo mi amor
Me robastes el corazon
Voy a estar contigo hasta el final
Baby I just wanna let you know
There's nobody in this world that could ever take your place

Yeah yeah
Come on
I know you probably think that I could never be that person
Got my mind all tangled up and I'm at the point of cursin
Sometimes I think that I should just forget this whole desire
That you was meant for someone else
But then I know I'm lying to myself
I can't run from the truth and desipate the moments
That I'm standing close to you this is like a game
And I was meant to be the winner
Loosing is not an option I can feel it when I'm with her
But then she says maybe we can just be friends
That weve been throught a lot together this could ruing everything
I'm saying mama please open up your eyes open up your mind
It's plain to see that you was meant to be with me
Quiero darte todo todo mi amor
Me estas matando y destrosando cuando dices que no
Girl give me tonight and I promise that I'll change your mind
Until your beggin me to love you girl like every night

Quiero darte todo mi amor
Me robastes el corazon
Voy a estar contigo hasta el final
Baby I just wanna let you know
There's nobody in this world that could ever take your place

I tried to tell you lil mama that I need you
I try to show you lil mama that I want you
You stole my heart girl
