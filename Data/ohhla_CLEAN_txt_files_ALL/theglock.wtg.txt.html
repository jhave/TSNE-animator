.. good thing we brought the glock

[U-God]
Yo, yo {*clears throat*}
Yo - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
It's a block party, niggaz just bust shots
Pssh - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
Thought you had props, with yo' gangsta bop
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
Meet me on the Hill or the Ave. hilltop
Pssh - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
You like what you see, my shiny-ass rock
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK

[Ghostface Killah]
I fuck the shit out of Patricia Drummonds
Looked out the window when her man was comin
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
Catch me at the Ruckers game
Playin the side with my spaghetti chain
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
Riker's Island shanked down
There go them niggaz who blew Hal my nigga
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
I'm at the ATM
Niggaz lookin sneaky in the grey BM
Yo - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK

[RZA]
Twenty drunk crabs try to push through the back door
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
Five boxcutters drawn they was ready for war
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
That's that thug down from Southside who tryin to front son
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
Little dog bout to flip, someone fucked his baby moms
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK

[Chorus: U-God singing]
Never leave home without it
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
Y'all niggaz ain't bout it, bout it
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
Never leave home without it
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
Y'all niggaz ain't bout it, bout it
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK

[Masta Killa]
You niggaz thought somethin was sweet
cause we rollin with the seeds today
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
Back in the A-Train, Halloween
Niggaz in masks, want my name ring
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
It's Brooklawn day, Pinkhouse day
Park Hill Stapleton day
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
That same cat we stomped out
Seen him at Eastern Parkway, to park (?)
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK

[Raekwon the Chef]
We in the spot where the money's marked
NARCs just jump through the window yo
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
Them niggaz killin young niggaz at will
Check how they did my little man son
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
We ain't slaves, we just rich renegades that's paid
Born in the ghetto yo
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK
Up in the staircase, flooded with cakes
Screwfacin with the dirty eights
 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK

[Chorus]

 - GOOD THING WE BROUGHT THE GLOCK (*repeat 4X to end*)</pre>
