   Intro
   
   The number one set and sound...live! Ghetto Music. Produced by
   KRS-One.
   
   Widdy-bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye bye
   Widdy-bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye bye
   
   Come in!
   
   Verse 1
   
   Many have claimed to attain levels in rhymin'
   But when I listen to 'em I see they're only lyin'
   They're tryin', but after some years if you ain't got it
   Lay it down, put it down, find a way to try and stop it
   Or change it, rearrange it, be a producer
   Don't touch the microphone because you'll always be the loser
   And laughed at, smirked on, you don't belong
   With those that perform their song on and on
   And on and on and on, yo, let's get specific
   This style is for the gifted, poetically uplifted
   I speak to you, not at you to attack you
   Maybe when I'm through with this rhyme I'll get a statue
   So now I ax you or tell you people literally
   When it comes to rockin' funky lyrics few are better than me
   Down with BDP, endlessly recitin' poetry
   Any time I'm in the street, you hear my voice, you know it's me
   KR...nope! I'm not ready to say my name yet
   Many say they teach, but this style they haven't attained yet
   
   Widdy-bye-bye bye, widdy-bye-bye bye bye, widdy bye-bye!
   Bye-bye bye-bye bye, widdy-bye-bye bye bye, widdy bye-bye!
   Bye bye bye bye, widdy-bye-bye bye bye, widdy bye-bye!
   Bye-bye bye-bye bye, widdy-bye-bye bye bye
   
   Verse 2
   
   Run it, son, plumb it you bum
   Don't you know that it's KRS-One
   That comes to sing the styles that ain't sung
   I rocked the party, but oh! Gotta run
   Cos only the suckers want a chance at that
   To see if KRS-One is really all that
   Instead of a rap I jap-slap all of 'em back
   Because the teacher that you see is not wack
   I'd like to stack up all the hits that I've made
   Three albums, a triple-layer cake
   And throw it in your face you waste
   Pick up the pace and taste a poet from the black race
   While I whip you whine, you're out of touch
   I'm out of time, here's another rhyme
   
   (The black man's in effect. Jeeeeeeesus! Oh gosh, dude. Oh gosh. Oh
   yes, dude. Yes)
   
   (What's the name of that crew? B.D.P)
   
   (Say what? I'm not down with the Juice Crew)
