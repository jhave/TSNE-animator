This is not a love song, nah!...

[Vast Aire]
I had a crush on Twanda
She went to I.S. 230
Figure 8, she was so curvy
Had a arch on her back with mad jewelry
Every Neanderthal wanted that cutie
Good complexion, not too thin
She had the baddest trim
I ain't talking about her haircut
She worked at my man's job
She made 11th graders wanted cradle rob
She got the sweet potato; I got the corn on a cob
Tuck ya shirt in she don't date no slobs
If you saw her smile she had a bad attitude and a wicked profile
Gorgeous face and a nice style
It'll make you say - "Damn you can have my child"
Got me thinking all this is worth my while
With my head in a cloud, screaming loud

(Hook) 2x
I got a Love Jones for ya body and ya skin tone
Five minutes alone, I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of ya own
So you can sit by the throne

[Vast Aire]
She look good in the Winter, better in the Summer
I met her at the bus stop she gave me her number
Sometimes we would go out and then slumber
Show me yours I'll show you mines
She lift up her sweater
Back then no girl could do better
I really dug Karen, or was it Anetta?
Or was it Vanessa, Stacey, or Trecee?
I didn't like Jessica she was too spacey
Maya's got attitude, Janice got her titty out
Missy's game, Viya's got her ass out
But Melissa's on the bed drinking wine
Don't hate on me pa, I got pimp design

(Hook) 2x

[Vast Aire]
Pink cookies in a plastic bag
Getting crushed by the Empire - State
C'mon baby why - wait
Let's make whoopee - today
I'ma Frankenstein Valentine
How's that? Cuz I can separate my heart from my mind
You are too emotional
And then about three seconds I'm about to go postal
In other words crazy nigga with a gun
I got a crush on you but you ain't the one
She was using sex for a weapon
Her aim was precise it kept me guessing
It kept me stepping
I was on my toes until I learnt my lesson
My man tried to tell me I was slipping (Slipping?)
I ain't even know that I was tripping
But this is not a love song
Well, maybe it is, maybe I'm fronting (Maybe I'm fronting)
Why don't you pull my card? (Uh-huh)
If the duece is wild I'll let down my guard

(Hook) 2x</pre>
