[Intro: Pharrell]
Yeah.. 3 in the morning, on the Westside highway, top down baby
Yeah, the motivation for me (fuck y'all!)
was them tellin' me what I couldn't be, oh well
Hey! Hey! Ohh! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! (Y'all gotta here this shit!)
Hey! Hey!

[Jay-Z]
Blueprint 3 shit... this the Blueprint baby
Uh, yeah.. ay, this a, special dedication (thank y'all)
I wanna thank you for the fuel, no really thank you
... Hehehe

I felt so inspired by what my teacher said
Said I'd either be dead or be a reefer head
Now sure if that's how adults should speak to kids
Especially when the only thing I did was speak in class - I'll teach his ass
Even betters what my uncle did
I popped my demo tape in, started to beat my head
Peaked out my eye, see if he was beatin' his
He might as well say "beat it kid, he's on the list!"
It's like I'm searchin' for kicks like a sneaker head
He gon keep pushin' me until I reach the ledge
And when I reach the ledge I'll tell 'em all to eat a dick
Take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread, spread, spread

[Chorus: Pharrell]
The motivation for me 

was them tellin' me what I could not be, oh well
Hey! Hey!
I'm so ambitious (hey!) I might hit two sisters (hey!)
Hey I'm on a mission (hey!) No matter what the conditions (hey!)
Forget the personal issues (hey!) when you been what I been through (hey!)
Hey if you believe it (then be) then you could conceive it (you see?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Jay-Z]
I had to lace up my boots even harder
Father is too far away to father; further-more all the 
kids either, smoke reefer or either 
move white; there's few writers in my cypher
So they made light of, my type of
dreams seem dumb, they said "wise up!"
How many guys-a, you see makin it from here?
The world don't like us, is that not clear? Alright but
I'm different, I can't base what I'm gon' be
offa what everybody isn't, they don't listen
Just whisperin behind my back
No vision, lack of ambition, so whack!

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Had a couple of meetings, no offers yet
Maybe I ain't good enough for these offices
Back to the drawin' board, duckin' officers
It's all good cause the streets is A&amp;R'in' this
So with or without, any of your involvement
We comin' for all of this, respect my conglomerate
I went from pauper to the President
Every deal I made set precedent
Niggas thought I'd fall without old buddy
Oh buddy, what I do is make more money
Dear Teacher, your probably somewhere near a speaker
I'm ballin' outta control, can you hear my sneakers
Fuck y'all~!

[Chorus] - minus last bar line
