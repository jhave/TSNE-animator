It's like one to the two and 313
I say, what, what, W-H-A-T
Put yo' hands where my eyes can see
Feelin' lovely, simpley bubbley
Can't we, cop a oz and stay free?
Invisible, so you can't see me
Feelin' iry, no envy
Got a pocket full of money cuz I'm slangin' that D

Watch me twirk it, baby
I see you work it, lady
Watch me twirk it, baby
I see you work it, baby(4x)

Well I be the navigator on this navigation
I stay aviation through out the whole nation
MC's got a bad case of perpatration
All those playin' out the word player hater
You must be a player to be player hated
So don't even state it if you can't regulate it
Yeah, I made it, you know them boys get faded
Mo' chedda, chedda, cuz nobody does it better
With a Guchi sweater make it better but I like it sweater
Straight to the bar, 7-Up and Armaretta
Get me what you got, I need a double shot
And if you got a fat monkey girl, baby, baby, baby, baby make it pop

Watch me twirk it, baby
I see you work it, lady
Watch me twirk it, baby
I see you work it baby(4x)

You gotta twirk that, work that
Let me squirt that
Tearin' up the club in the back of Kodiak
Triple six mobbin', head bobbin'
Money ain't no probbin', got the girls swingin' like Tarzan
For all them suckas want a robbin'
Only black talon slugs that I'm lobbin'
And uh, it might stop, if uh my glock pop
But me uh will not bust off the gun shots
So no need for you to call the cops
If you hear the music to loud up the block
I always gotta mo', so Mc's wanna clone
My style, straight out ya zone, like Maurice Malone
Mo-Town, no place like home
Get 'em on, get 'em on, get 'em on, get 'em on
I said, get 'em on
Get 'em on, get 'em on, get 'em on, get 'em on

Watch me twirk it baby
I see you work it lady
Watch me twirk it baby
I see you work it, baby(4x)</pre>
