[Lil' Kim]
Throw on a Hollyhood Wear by Lil' Kim
You know the Queen Bee known for (doin it way big)
We take trips to Mekenos, Greece
just to shop, we don't stop (doin it way big)
This is for my millionaire glub golfers
Comin up like Halle and Denzel, winnin the Oscars
Y'all get y'all diamonds from Jacob, I ain't mad at ya
I get mine straight out the Kimberly Gold Mine in Africa
I smack niggaz 'cross the face with a Centurion Card
who don't believe I'm (doin it way big)
In the Contintental T, magnolia B
.. (man, she doin it way big)
I'm comin through Hummer stuntin, and I'm frontin
Workin that LaBurke and, Ermez bag
Only multi-millionaires who know about that
be like.. (damn, she doin it way big)

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
Anything we do we do it B.I.G.
Every move we make is always B.I.G.
And the number one rule, think B.I.G.
And the best rapper's still B.I.G. (one more time now)
Anything we do we do it B.I.G.
Every move we make is always B.I.G.
And the number one rule, think B.I.G.
And the best rapper's still B.I.G.

[Lil' Kim]
Pull out the G-55, Cavarolet
Oh by the way I'm (doin it way big)
Eight Alpine speakers, custom made H-R-E rims
(uh-huh, doin it way big)
The chinchilla blanket, the black diamond anklet
It's made out of farragut faggot, try to yank it
Got all glass, Benz in all class
I do it big, my first kid gon' have a crib all brass
This is, exotic y'all, I got it y'all
Every color lizard watch from Scotty y'all
Private jets, Tiffany silverware sets
I got shit department stores ain't even get yet
I drop, 30 or more in Christian D'or
They gotta, close the store and let me shop some more
We go to, Broadway plays in six white Rolls Royce
(now that's what you call doin it way big)

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
As long as I'm here, I'm gon' keep doin it, doin it how I do it
When I do it best believe I be (doin it way big)
We greet our guests at the door
with champagne and cigars that read (doin it way big)
Chrome on the doors, stone on the floors
Fourteen karat gold, paint on the walls
We swim in pools with marble waterfalls
Ball baby or don't ball at all
My bathroom is Chanel, my bedroom Louis Vuitton
And office decorated in, Ralph Lauren
I got a, Versace couch and pillows I sleep on
With the matchin rob and slippers, I beg to differ
LaPerla lingerie, cause it fits my body
Get with us, we know how to throw a party
And you can't get in, without a QUeen Bee members only jacket
that reads (doin it way big)

[Chorus]

{*dice rattle*} C'mon dice
{*dice rattle*} (one more time now)
{*dice rattle*} C'mon dice

[Kim] And the best rapper's still B.I.G.</pre>
