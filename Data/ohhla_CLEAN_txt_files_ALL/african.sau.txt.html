[Saul Williams]
Freedom, ignorance, jealousy, belligerence
Anger, self-control, tolerance, to and fro
Wisdom, ecstasy, addiction, dependency
Discipline, counter act, pray for peace, then attack
Dominance, contradict, upper class derelict
Downgrade, downsize, upstate, uprise
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Downtown, on the block, at the club
Steaming hot, dancing, talking shit, telling lies
Like a pimp, meanwhile, underpaid
Read like, second grade
Uncle Sam, sign you up
Benefits, and a gun
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
African people, African people, African people, African people
Shotgun, shotgun, shotgun, shotgun
Rise up, over-stand
Stand your ground
Own your land
Serve all, love all, never sleep
Never fall, meditate
Eat right, pray first
then fight, but for truth, not for fame
Not for glory, or the game
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
African people, African people, African people, African people
Shotgun, shotgun, shotgun, shotgun
Liberia, Iraq
Dark brown, light black
South Africa, Mozambique
Mud hut, concrete, AIDS ridden
Heart disease, strange fruit, Southern trees
Sierre Leone, diamond mines
Cameroon, pipe lines
Port-au-Prince, Salvadore
Civil right, Civil War
Zimbabwe, trenchtown
Money makin', Queens bound
BX, Shaolin
Uptown, Brooklyn, upstate, Newburgh, unseen, unheard
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
Now tell me, where my niggas at?
African people, African people, African people, African people
Shotgun
Shotgun, (African people)
Shotgun, (African people)
African people</pre>
