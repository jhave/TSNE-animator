[Intro: Ja Rule]
Ha ha here we go again
Rule, Mary J. Bilge
Whoo Holla, Ha ha

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
It's just those rainy days
Spent a lifetime tryin' to wash away
'Til the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me
On all those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryin' to wash away
'Til the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

[Mary J. Blige]
We're always livin' so crazy and sexy and cool
And we begin to love it (begin love it)
Watchin' all the heartache and pain of the world
And think nothing of it (thinkin' nothing of it)
Baby I got love for you
And I know that you got me baby (got me baby)
But every time the sun shines bright it gets so cloudy

(Chorus)

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige] (x2)
Cuz nobody loves the rain
Can't stand it
It always seem to fall
Baby handle it
Baby didn't we tell you before about chasin those waterfalls
Yeah

[Ja Rule]
Rule
Mary baby, see it just a sin
It's the path that I'm on, in this midst of madness
And my rain is a tad bit, to wet for the average
Yeah, and I can see it her eyes
That she's scared of the soul collision by Rule and Blige
In my demise, smile on them Rainy Dayz
Cause that's the Lord shedding tears on my grave
And it's so real it's funny, Rule and Gotti rain supreme
And hail down money, but the storm's still comin

[Mary  rapping]
God, it ain't easy for none of us
Ghetto children growing up alone, all we do is cuss
Mad at the world, cause no one told us about the storm
And they ain't give enough love to keep us warm (no love, no love)
Every time I look around my people are dying
Stressed out, pissed off, but I'm keep on tryin (what)
To make sure me and you we make it through this maze
Till the sun shines again on these Rainy Dayz

(Chorus)

[Mary J. Blige]
I feel like an angel, mend my broken wings
So I can soar again, Lord let me in
And through all the passion and the pain and the hurt
I feel like I'm fallin' (yeah)
Makin' promises of love to those that spread love
And for those that can't take it, stand up
Baby we gon' make it and the words of Marvin Gaye
"War is not the answer"

(Chorus)

(Bridge) x2</pre>
