[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Na-na na na-na-nah
Na-na-na-na na na na na-nah
Na-na-na na na-na-nah
Na-na-na-na na na na na-nah (IGH!)
... Na-na-na-na na na na na-nah
Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na na na na na-nah
Na na-na-na-na nah...

[Chance The Rapper]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
... Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
... My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believin' in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathin' in?
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young; just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screamin', I see his demons in empty hallways
... I trip to make the fall shorter
... Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hopin' I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hopin' I don't get sick
Making all of this money hopin' I don't get rich
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams

Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealin' to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
... I think love is beautiful, too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers shootin' through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop, helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
... I still miss bein' a senior
And performing at, all those open mic events
High schools, eyes closed seein' arenas
... And I still get jealous of Vic
... And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you and the rest of your team
... Smokin' cigarettes to look cooler
... I only stop by to look through ya
... And I'm only gettin' greedier
... And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
... And I still can't find talent
And I'm still choosin' classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be askin' God to show his face
And I still be askin' God to show his face...

[Chance The Rapper - singing]
I am a new man, I am sanctified, ohhh
Ohh I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light
Rain, rain don't go away...
Bow wow wow wow wow wow {*7X to fade*}
IGH!</pre>
