[Dona]
Word to mother, you my blood, they hate on us
Evils try to do you in, but they never could win
Anything happen to you, I'm the next to kin
Hustle like a Mexican, monumental battles
In the shadows of a don, in the name of the son
We gonna rise above, can't critize a thug
In the search for the American dream
Before you, I'd rather they fuck with me, too many questions
How the fuck did we meet? Too many lessons
I promise to never leave, even under pressure
I won't talk, I'd rather die, on my bloody knees
You know me, jealousy's never been a factor
You my nigga, before and after the paper
A hundred new reasons for niggaz to hate ya
Finally I find a place I call home
But the devil wanna strip me, takin' everything I own

[Chorus: Dona]
You can't break the bond
What don't kill you, will make you strong
It can't be weakened, the faith is strong
Whether, handcuffs or pressures, metal bracelets on

[Chorus: Cormega]
You can't break the bond
What don't kill you, will make you strong
It can't be weakened, the faith is strong
Whether, handcuffs or pressures, metal bracelets on

[Cormega]
I will pop a nigga top before you make a nigga drop
For your boy coked on oil, lay down the block
For you, I pleed the fifth, death before dishonor
When treachery's surround us, our cause ain't lost
It's destiny that found us
I done met real niggaz whose yet to meet your honor
You my legacy, jealousy will never be a problem
You share my street persona, and deepest knowledge
Of the ghetto, the grief and the drama
Even deeper is your intentions of feedin' your mama
Therefore we eatin' like we servin' those fiends at the carter
You need it, I got it, I die for you
Give me the chair, I'll fry for you
It's where you find loyalty, I keep the nine auto
How many times I told you? Non-scrimity, but then I trust
Even if try individually, we bend ya'll up
There's no equivalent, lyrically, I will give it to you niggaz
In a flash, like Pistol Pete

[Chorus: Cormega]
