[Dee tha Mad Bitch]

What goes on in the mind of a bad boy? Nothin but payback
Whos next, the clip, callin murder could nothin the contract
Better watch your back
Since hes makin that comeback
The 1-87 will stop em
The hollow point, will drop ya
Go on, heres a scene for your soul
So take heed when you meet face-to-face, here comes the grim reaper
You better ???? from the depths of hell
Hes a real McCoy
But aint no stoppin this girl is bad boy
He aint no joke
Muthafucka grab your throat
Before you find yourself cut with a blade
As your bloody body lays on top of cement
In front of your president 
It was a murder for hire
Hit an innocent child in the crossfire
Now hes confined to a jail
Got shot six times, in his spine
But his mind is still down at the grind
Hes willin to destroy
Thats what he lives for, to be a bad boy

Chorus:

Bad Boy, Bad Boy, watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do, watch out, we commin at you.
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do, were comin after you
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do, watch out, we comin at you
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do, watch out, we comin at you

[2PAC]

I got these bustas on my block and they after me
Runnin round tellin these niggas, how they gonna capture me
Its gettin crazy, its hard to make my mind up
Now should I, buck em down, or put my nine up?
You see, I aint a bad boy, just a boy who had it bad
I graduated from 22s to 3-57 mags
Runnin on these marks fore they stashin
I aint askin, give it up, or get to blastin
The penintnetiary dont scare me
A straight thug nigga, the whole setll take care of me
And tell me, who the fuck you gonna find
Rough enough to tear these bitch-niggas, this is mine
Now busta, meet my nine, 24 on the grind
Im sick about mine, and uh, aint nothin wrong with gettin high
A hustlin-ass nigga from the projects, Im makin loot
And screamin Thug Life, nigga, when they shoot
They made me a.....

[Chorus]

[Dee tha Mad Bitch]

Now how many bad boys in the house 
So hurry boys got the biggest nuts
What the fuck, I gave em the blunts
Havin a grudge against the whole fuckin world
A 16 shot-block-glock, thatll stop em
Theyre sure to hit the ground
Nothin, bustin a cap on no more every round
A bad boy is the big, shot on the block
He got knots, bigger rocks for the cops
Before he gets props
So you petty boys, you cant fuck with em
You can eat the biggies good friend
Or become a victim of a dead man
Its sad to see, when you end up six-feet deep
So rest in peace, muthafucka, join the pow
he got nothin but the realest style
Flavors when on the mic
and packin the meal like life
Savers, sweep up on you at night
His grip on tight, and make you take a bite
Thats all she wrote, barrel went down your throat
Killin off these niggas for fun
Murder one, and throw away your gun
Hes livin his life like a soldier
Thats what he lives for, to be a Bad Boy

[Chorus]</pre>
