East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
East Side Rip RidazIt's a B-K all day
Cause it's still East Side till I die...

[TROLL]
Now recognize the Kelly B.G.
Throwin' up two C's
Hit the Crens with the strap, blue down and B-D's
Die-'Rus can't escape once the gat starts burn
Because I'm bright dead shirts
Make damn good targets
Takin' no fuckin' prisoner so when I shoot I'm hitting ya
Slobs slide dead once the 4-4 gets to spin up
And fillin' up snoop M-U-T's
Breakin' new lives down to their goddamn knees
Don't like it ?this suit me bro'? cause I makes up my duty hoe
To dis you be Slobs to your face up to studio
Cause after you nigga talking shit is weak
Gangbangin' on the mic but you's a bitch on the streets
Perpetration
Line about that nigga you smoked
And waitin' ??? yourself you shit if you was ever approached
I ain't pointin' no fingers
Cause you know who you are
Jackin' Slob muthafuckas talkin' lie like you hard
Fuck all y'all niggas I'm a B-Dog killa
Shot outs to the Atlantics and them N-Hood niggas
Troll Locs with the evil-ass East Side Ridas
K's up, Slobs down
Cause the Crips is much more wide

East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
Cause it's still East Side till I die

[BIG FREEZE]
I'm buckin' all Slobs nigga slippin'
Set trippin' is my favourite past time Loc cause I'm crippin'
See a Slob and releasin' pop pop
Had a biff to my Glock pistola as I roll up the block
Fool I gives a fuck about where you from
If I catch you run a Crip
I'ma leave you all body numb
Just a little present called aftermath
Me and my Tec-9 dumpin' in a Slob bluffin' the blood bath
It's the B-K in me that makes my ride
On another homicide
As I'm claimin' Nationwide
EAST SIDE WATTS FRANKLIN CRIP GANG
Swervin' on you Slob niggas, show you how we gangbang
So I'ma smell now cause I never shed a tear for a figure
Freeze Tec-9 tough 9's and I'ma spit up
So let me get the beat
K-Rider's on the frontline
It's Slob killin' nigga!!!
Yeah Crips it's some set trip time
Don't crackin' rat, packin' fool it's on
It's B-K all day and you was caught in the zone
I suggest you get your tombstone ready, you know why
It's Watts Franklin B-K till I die

East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
Cause it's still East Side till I die

[AWOL]
Shot a Slob in the face three times with the 1-0
Nigga be talkin' that shit while gettin' jacked like a stank hoe
I'm not to see fuck with, play with the step two
I trip by a Crip cause I'm in it killin' Crips too
Enemy killa 1-8-7 you want peep
Kelly ain't down with no muthafuckin' peace treaty
Slobs get dealt with, Slobs get chopped up
And if you ?? wanna get chopped one once the Slobs get mopped up
But all at the same time Cuz let me tell ya
Got my dick sucked than a ???
And niggas who know me
Know I ain't joke, would
That nigga who know me well know this Kelly Park neighborhood
Niggas sayin' E-Ricket
And nigga would get his ass served
And nigga sayin' E-Ricket again, a nigga just pronounce his last word
I'ma that kinda B.G.
That makes this Slob wonder, how a 50 round clip
Could take so many under
Cause I don't give a fuck
I never gave a fuck
And I still don't give a fuck
So you Slobs fools just shit outta luck and stuck
It's all good but I ain't sayin' ain't wise
I'm a muthafuckin' Crip from that Compton East Side

East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
East Side Rip Ridaz
It's a B-K all day
Cause it's still East Side till I die...

[BIG BUN]
Yo this is Big Bun from the mad-ass A-D-C-C
I want to give a shot outs to all my O.G.'s from Atlantic and Ward Lane
Maniac and Jackie Jack
To the rest of you niggas I don't know: Fuck!

[TROLL]
Yeah this is Troll from East Side Kelly Park Compton Crip Gang
