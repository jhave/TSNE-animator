Coca, muah
Elephant in the room
Crills

Early in the morning, could barely feel my face 
Cuttin' that raw raw hammer on my waist 
My baby mammas' stressin', I'm like fuck out of my face 
Feds on my ass now, 'bout to catch a case 
I'm about that "makin money" I'm alergic to poor 
Shit, I done made some hoes out of the girls next door 
6 in the morning when they kick in the door 
I'm probly outside the forge gettin' brain in the Porsche 
What Porsche? My Porsche yeah the GT Porsche 
Of course I floss like them DC boys 
Shit, right at club love I fucked at least three broads 
In the middle of the dancefloor such a sleazy whore 
Now, headed for paradise 
Carlos Bengante, jazz in the background, Harry Belofante 
Seagul in the clouds look honey im comin'
Different strokes, different folks, you guessed it, Phillip Drummin 
Now I'ma fuck the pussy 'till the pussy get numb and
Roll over naked then we kush kush puffin'
This is way too easy though, I am the magnifico 
Cuban is pride, but I'm much more like eazy though 
If you don't believe me you can see me on your TV yo,
Taylor Made Versachi, I'm with Khaled on that speedy boat 
When it comes to latina MC's there's none bigger
Now who's gonna tell me that I can't say nigga?
Nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga bitch hoe 
'Cause some chicks is bitches, and some chicks is hoes 
Some independent ladies yeah they make a lotta dough
So they get nuthin' but love and respect from Fat Joe 
I remember when I stepped in the game yo 
Army fatigue with grey Nikes, that flow Joe,

You gotta flow Joe, you gotta flow Joe, you gotta gotta gotta gotta let 'em know Joe 
You gotta flow Joe, you gotta flow Joe, you gotta gotta gotta gotta let 'em know 
I'm Borricua 'till I die motherfuckers, yes I will detach you 
I'll leave holes you can't cover with tattoos 
All you lame souls keep prayin' to them statues, when I'm the ghetto God, I'll bless you, achoo
The one spitter, the can't get ridder, major label dropped me what I do?
I got richer
80 babies terror on the corner, I'm the pitcher
Got a new connect and what I do?
I got richer
? the wop bam boo 
Guess what, America we love you 
And I'm a stay reppin' that TS Crew 
And show ya motherfuckers how the BX do 
Shit, every time I rockwild, it's more like a zoo 
Blinds wrapped around the corner if your too late your blue 
In that new white phantom, call it: milk on wheels 
Niggaz wilin' like Joe jus ODed off pills 
I ODed of crills, I ODed of mills 
You Monopoly guys, haulin' in no billz 
Shit, niggaz keep askin': how come he so real? 
6'1", light skin, got them green eyes, teal
Haha, it's the fugitive 
Coca 
I'm on the run, and I'm eatin' bitch 
Street runner on this one, bitch 
We'd like to welcome you, "elephant in the room", (thank you, thank you), bitch
Top of my game right now, can't nobody see me man 
We use different forms of transportation nigga 
I'm on different planets than y'all niggaz right now 
You can deny all you want nigga 
Coca's spittin' that shit, these streets is mine 
Oh, I get on some Pun shit 
What you want? That hardcore, commercial shit? 
What you wanna dance? Crills mania, nigga 
BXTS! 
I owns this shit!</pre>
