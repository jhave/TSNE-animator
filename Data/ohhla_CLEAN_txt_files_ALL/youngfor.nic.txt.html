[Nicki Minaj]
I used to think that we'd run away
Whenever-lay, pretty summer day
I remember when you would say
We'd be okay come what may
I never knew you would lie to me
Took everything, from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

[Chorus]
Just say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever
I'll be over here, you'll be over there
I'ma shed a tear, but I really don't care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever

[Nicki Minaj]
I used to think that we'd reunite
I'd be your wife, in the real life
I thought that you'd come back for me
and you would take me away
I never knew only as a teen
You'd reappear, only in my dream
You're so long in the doorway
But before you walk away

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
This is, my, last, cry
Is this, the only way?
And this is, my, own, prison
I'm frozen in time, in time, in time...

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You'll always be mine
Frozen in time
Young, forever...</pre>
