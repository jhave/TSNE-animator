[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
Persecuted by the world, all I want is my baby girl
In my arms, braided up on pretty curls
Keep the fame and the fortune, I don't need it
There's too many out there wanna see me bleeding
As I awake I feel stuck in time
In this place, people lose they fucking mind
I see shadows in the night of demons dancing
Most penitentiaries overseen by klansmen
Stay strong even though it's hard
Keep my head up and stay close to God
I see friends I knew back in school
They aint the same, covered up in tattoos
In the land of the free I'm forever known
Look up at the sky and pretend I'm home
Dear lord, I know you've got a plan for me
But I'd rather be at home with my family

[Hook 2X]
If I die, mamma don't lose your mind
Stay strong - the world don't accept my kind
I was born hate free, always been different
It's hard to stay alive when you're brown and gifted

[Verse 2: Coast]
I understand that in due time my life is gon' slide behind
The curtain of uncertainty, the pearly gates are defied
Cause I'm a rambling man, a gambling man
So when the shit hits the fan my plan is to stand as a man
My canvas is bland, painted the perfect picture but my tears made the paint run
I need an eraser but shit it aint one
The critics lookin at my picture say it feels dark
But you could ?sneak? in my heart, baby it's still art
I know some people that respect me for me
I know some people that neglect me for me
And so it pans out
Now when I pass and the last of my breath has been breathed
*BREATH* at ease...
Mamma don't cry for me, I'm watching over you
I'm still doing the same thang your son's supposed to do
So if you love me love me and everything is fine
We gon' reuinite in the sky in due time

[Hook 2X]
If I die, Mamma don't lose your mind
Stay strong - the world don't accept my kind
I was born hate free, always been different
It's hard to stay alive when you're brown and gifted

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
I tried to tell you that these motherfuckers wanted my soul
Hate me 'til I'm dead and gone but in love with my dough
As they listen to my CD, they got from somebody
'I can't believe that he sayin' this in custody
Doesn't he realize we got him right where we want him?'
I was warned by a prisoner- 'they'll be coming'
Can you imagine life without rats that
Backstab their own to try to get where they at?
I made millions but felt I was never rich
How can greed make people be so devilish?
I wrote a book entitled 'They Can't Stop Me'
Took about 20 pens and alotta coffee
They hit me up with some years and a small fine
It's gonna be the greatest comeback of all time
And all I got left is true fans
'Cause my horoscope said that my bitch found a new man

[Hook 2X]
If I die, Mamma don't lose your mind
Stay strong - the world don't accept my kind
I was born hate free, always been different
It's hard to stay alive when you're brown and gifted</pre>
