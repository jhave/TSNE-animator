[Part One]
       Yo man let me make some Cpt. Krunch
       man alright
          Yo man we have any milk?
       Yeah, what time is it?
       I don't know, what day is it?
          Don't know, well I'll tell you.

    Well it was a Wednesday 
    me and Boss Hog was kinda hungry
    like two eggs, and a slop beef slice of lettuce
    and a glass of milk and some cookies.
    Spotted in the mist was a BK logo
    what we said - well what do you know
    this chick thought I was trying to play fly
    cause I had a pair of blue jeans on.

Young girl, won't you take my order?
she said, "Yeah, but right now I'm kinda busy...
can't you see I'm trying to put this band aid on my finger?"
Lingering, I could tell
she's a B-K mademoiselle
Ripped uniform and bottom bell
and some Jelly stuff on her sleeve
Look to this cause I had no name tag on my collar
could be pissed cause she's clocking 2.45 an hour
And then Boss Hog hollar
"Girl you better make this quick!"
She said, "I ain't your girl and I ain't your chick!"
I had an idea and lickity split
took my hat off and that was it

Dread locks fallen all over me and then I said
"Yeah now we'll see!"
And o' with quick velocity honey was mesmerized
   "Ain't you that guy?"
"Aint you that GIRL!"
   "De La Soul, right?"
"No Tracy Chapman!"
   "Why don't you come over to the counter; and write me out an 
    autograph?"
Ha ha ha, I had to laugh
She was quick with the Bic just to get that autograph
But me and Hogg just laughed, and laughed
    "What's the name of that song you sing?"
"Living in a fast car," I said
Forget about the order I made
I'll go get a slice of pizza instead.

Chorus: repeat 2X

Bitties in the BK lounge, All they do is beg and they scrounge
Bitties in the BK lounge (2x)

[Part Two]
F  - female
P2 - Posdonus

F  - Excuse me, would you take my order I have to go
     Shashawna's got a real job, dag don't you know!
P2 - Oh yeah, Now I recognize
     The real real bitty with the fake fake eyes
     Yo, can I interest you in some burgers and fries?
F  - Yes you can, but you can keep your lies
     cause you know you can't diss me
     but your pissing me off
     I know where you live and I know that your soft
     You're as booty as they come [booty?]
     and you dress like a geek
     my shoes cost more than you make in two weeks
P2 - Look, you don't have to play fly in here
     I can tell your fly by the weave that you wear!
     But you must be aware that a fly can be swatted by a BK tray
     By the way yo, here's yours
F  - I know your just sweating me to kill the noise
     of your polyester pants and thier o' so high waters
     Look at what you do all day but take orders
     You bow tie wearing, clocking and staring
     I know your just upset because you cant get the rat/wrap
     I think you Chubby for my man is living slack
P2 - Yeah, I know your man, the biggest punk in school
     selling devil rock to the fiends and the fools!
     With one hand that punk I could snap- the kid is so skinny...
F  - But we be livin fat
P2 - Speaking of fat, would you like a diet soda?
     Cause less fat on you would spare us all the odor
     Better yet pour it down the pants and let the acid kill
     the smell that should have been left to Masingel!
     Let me make you a deal, take the soda free and jet
     I got to much family to heed your threats
F  - Are you a family man? [Word booty!]
     Well I shouldn't be surprized 
     your sister's flipping burgers and your momma's frying fries
P2 - Don't even try that shit!
F  - Oh damn look! [What?]
F  - Here comes one more
     It's your father he just finished mooping the floor
     Now give them a hand, its the BK clan
     So you can't talk garbage about who I am
P2 - well, arn't we living foul
     Speaking of foul how bout some chicken for the cow?
     Ops I meant you sorry for the mix up
     but your stomachs always big from the sexual slip ups!
F  - I could buy you and sell you for pennies, young man!
     {You'd better!}
     I think theres something you should understand
     I try to be nice and help the poor make money
     And since I know you need it, I'll go elsewhere dummy!
     Now B-K workers is too damn rude
     I think I'll go get me some Chinese food
