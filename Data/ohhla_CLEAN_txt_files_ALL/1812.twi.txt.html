[Lil Za]
I can't imagine what it's like with you
All I'm asking can a nigga spend a night with you
Not really in the mood well I got some weed
Relax your mind and after that it's white wine
That's right I know what you like
Not the prototype just living by the motto type
You know YOLO right shit I'm fuckin with you though
I know you thinking like this nigga think I'm some kinda ho
But no I really don't I just think that you deserve it
Say you never done it but I promise you would love it

[Khalil]
Me and you up in this room
And I know just what you wanna do
So leave them clothes beside the bed
It's gonna be a night you won't forget

[Khalil]
Mr. Underestimated girl first place
I'm tryna slide to the crib like first base
Hit the condo room shaking like an earthquake
Worse case Za come through and let the girls bake
You thinking bout the other dude that you found
I wonder what they spending all their time doing now
But back to you I'm really tryna take you down
Say your tryna fall in love but that ain't really what I'm bout
What you thinking gril I got a nice hotel
Presidential suite you and me 1812

[Khalil]
You and me up in this room
And I know just what you wanna do
So leave them clothes beside the bed
It's gonna be a night you won't forget

[Lil Twist]
So when I take them clothes off slow
Ain't no telling where my tongue or where my hands go
Hell yeah I'm a freak baby you ain't know
I been tryna sneak peek through your peep hole
For a minute now that you let me in it
Imma teach this chick a lesson she salutes to this luitenant
Now reporting back to this young sergant
I'm just tryna pick these flowers out your garden
And water them with bacardi maybe
Maybe you can be Lil Twizzy's baby
And rep young mula baby and meet Lil Tunechi maybe but for now wow

[Khalil]
Me and you up in this room
And I know just what you wanna do
So leave them clothes beside the bed
It's gonna be a night you won't forget</pre>
