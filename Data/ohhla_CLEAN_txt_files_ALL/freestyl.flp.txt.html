(*talking*)
We got that green stuff, Big Tite
Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in y'all face

[Slim Thug]
I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue that
22 that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Hook - 2x]
Too much money, too much cash
All y'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All y'all haters, can kiss our ass

[Lil Flip]
Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging 4's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And y'all haters, y'all can kiss our ass

[Hook - 2x]

[Tite]
I got too much M-O-N-E-Y
Anything I S-E-E, I B-U-Y
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far
