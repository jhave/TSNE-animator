Bab
I'm a Ruff Ryder
Hey
I'm a Ruff Ryder
Oh no no, yeah yeah yeah
Mmmmm-hmmmm, yeah

(Verse 1)
Woke up one Sunday morning
At the crack of dawn and
My baby left a letter
Tellin' me don't forget her (Oh no)
She said I wasn't able
To keep our love stable
She knew that I was foolin' around (Oh yes she did)
She saw me with the girl downtown

(Chorus)
So you sayin' that you love me baby
But you're gone forever and more
And more, and more, and more
And I'm gonna be sorry baby
Cuz I want you more than before
And more, and more, and more

(Verse 2)
Now as the letter goes on
I'm reminded of the time when she's all alone
All the days that she's cried
But never once did I ever see the pain in her eyes (No no)
She said that I was wrong
That a man who doesn't care isn't all alone (Silly ass nigga)
If I could do it all again
Girl I know one thing is I would not let you go

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
You walked away with nothin' to say (Oh no)
Said you tired of the games I play
There ain't nothin that I wouldn't do
To find a way to get back to ya
Now you're gone and I'm all alone (I'm all alone)
Wish that you, would come back home
You know I need you here in my life
All I wanna do is try to make right

(Chorus)

Baby baby baby
So you sayin' that you love me baby
Let me talk to ya (I'm a Ruff Ryder)
So you sayin' that you love me baby (I know)
I should of spent more time with you
So you sayin' that you love me baby
Can I make it up to you?
I should of been more careful

(Chorus) x2

Mmmmm-hmmmm, yeah
I should of spent more time with you
Cuz you was my baby boo
Rememba all the rocks in da park
Rememba when we made love in da dark
Rememba all da shit baby (I'm a Ruff Ryder)

And I'm gonna be sorry baby
Cuz I want you more than before
And more, and more, and more</pre>
