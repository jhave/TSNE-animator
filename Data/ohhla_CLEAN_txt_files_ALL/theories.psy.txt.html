Cops are found dead and to no surprise 
And get classified wasted no lie 
They come and invade the wrong life 
And only the strong survive so they die 
They rest at a place of violence 
And 5-0's get broke like codes of silence 
Sirens flood the scene with blood 
They come firing 
We crooks get thrown big books 
And hooked with a life sentence 
Hunted mental stress on these LA streets 
Permanent like inks on flesh, shit 
We blast off the big guns 
Til blankets of death have wrapped everyone 
Homeboys and the law abiding 
Get stuck full of holes they're dying 
Don't let the wild bullet 
Conspiracies hit the target 
Befriend the whole system 
Or you too will be found dead 
  
CHORUS (x1)
The code of the streets means anything goes 
Against these wars with street fleets 
Wanted by many 
These sick-ass cliques ain't touched by any 
Law enforcement 
The code of the streets 
  
The masterplan don't include us so they shoot us 
Supply weapons, coke, crack and buddha 
Keep track of who took the bait through computers 
Enslave and regulate the hoods through the juras 
We're all victims as the plot thickens 
Better recognize the big plan clock's ticking 
Stricken by the plague no sign of us saved 
Satan is the ruler of the modern day 
We fight angelic wars where my block attacks yours 
Numbed by the drugs that are sold on street stores 
Everybody out here walking around in a daze 
You can't find your way out the maze through purple haze 
And while you're lost you're desensitized with force 
Through violence that's televised in spite of the cross 
Through news and other media we see homicide 
So murder and death are now part of our daily lives 
All of a sudden you're gunning blasting's just a game 
Join a gang run with them destroy your own plane 
For a name, fame and crumbs you're dumb 
You're feeding right into the conspiracy the outcome is death 
  
CHORUS (x1) 
  
And anybody else that enforce the law 
Gets broke the fuck off 
We fight with them 
How many men get sent to destroy the violent movement? 
Oppose government 
The code of the streets </pre>
