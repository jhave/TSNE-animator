Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Every day I have a question, life consistently stepping
My shit is getting crazy, niggas asking for a blessing
Keep it real dog, shit, I'm really stressing
Feel like suicide is the only thing I'm missing
Stuck between my vision, I'm a soldier on a mission
Post-traumatic stress got me feeling like I'm tripping
Stay at ease, people dying all around
The money that you get put them walls all around
Every day a blank day, stopped thinking good
Evil thoughts in my head got me on a back step
Doing so bad, I couldn't sleep on the mattress
Slept on my floor, cause my stomach wouldn't have it
Your body don't lie, my eyes couldn't cry
Your heart don't lie, it's a conflict inside
Gotta free my mind, don't worry about the time
Instructions for your mind, you just gotta grind
You alive

[Chorus x2]
Sometimes I go to sleep with my AK
If I blast it, it's gonna be a good day

[Verse 2]
I still got the guns, I still got the bullets
But it's not worth it, guaranteed, don't do it
It's just cause we miss you, it wouldn't be a issue
If I chose to go in peace, no pain is very simple
Like sleeping in your bed, you dream and then you wake up
What's the other side? We all die, what we made of?
Shit trip me out, we all get reborn
If you come back again, I'ma see you on the other side
Maybe get another chance to life
Live life to the fullest, be happy you alive
Embrace death, and be happy that they die
Probably at peace in the sunshine
This life is a jungle, I'm trying to stay humble
We all locked in a cage, get money or you struggle
The American way, don't nobody love you
Until you love yourself, word to dad and the hustle
I can't have kids, cause I wouldn't say I love 'em
My shit so real, you could have money, they coming
Damn, America got me evil
J. Edgar Hoover, still out killing people
- Lil Boss

[Verse 3]
Sometimes, I leave the locker room stressed out
Feel like taking pills, just to come down
Coach said if I keep slipping, he gon' bench me
I'm thinking to myself, how you gon' stop history?
Even if I'm the 6th man, put the best against me
I'll be at the court every day, don't miss me
After we win, I get the Hennessy and scrambled eggs
Keep it real with myself before I ever give
Up, looking forward to meet the president
Yeah bitch, I'm heaven sent, represent
All I need is the NBA to let me in
All I do is Hoop Life, cause we gotta win
Sometimes I go out, because I gotta live
My teammates really show me who my partners is
The hoop game, show me what my options is
Lil B told me to remain positive
So I kept living
- Lil B

[Chorus x2]
Sometimes I go to sleep with my AK
If I blast it, it's gonna be a good day

[Outro]
Keep your head up
I love you
It's Lil B
