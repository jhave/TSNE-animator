"I'm a king with a sting of a scorpion"

[Mad Child]
Scorpion King has slowly returned

"I'm a king with the sting of a scorpion"

Rifle....

"I'm a king with the sting of a scorpion"

[Mad Child]
Scorpion King has slowly returned

"I'm a king with the sting of a scorpion"

Rifle....

Yo, get challenges of the brain, images of line versus crane
Walking around with feathers in my mane
King of the hill, for the way I'm bringing the kill
Back to the damned, action bent, packing ten
Territorial my friend, only when cornered
Then I let it all fall in it's natural order
Or should I say the chain, that links the food source
The higher archy of friends who first the second corpse

"I'm a king with a sting of a scorpion"

[Mad Child]
Scorpion King has slowly returned

"I'm a king with the sting of a scorpion"

[Prevail]
Rifle....

"I'm a king with the sting of a scorpion"

[Mad Child]
Scorpion King has slowly returned

"I'm a king with the sting of a scorpion"

[Prevail]
Rifle....

Act one, the wings of black pegasus
Attack the whole pack, we never hold back
Buried unfound, on sea of ground
Autopsy lounge, girls of gypsy brown
Puffing iodine, nouns of landmines
Puppet hand signs, double down rhymes
Back by iron and steel
Sirens and wheels break, smashing vertabraes like grapes
My rifle make and serial number
Imperial Prevail wonder, I'm a Chemical Brother
So is Moka Only, so is Ab Rude
Codename Scorpion, the first volume

"I'm a king with a sting of a scorpion"

[Mad Child]
Scorpion King has slowly returned

"I'm a king with the sting of a scorpion"

[Prevail]
Rifle....

The children of the  night, guided by sonar
We fly-by once and split you down the centre
Clean, and you have no idea how hard it is
To miss the major arteries and still get under cartilage
I pivit, dove it inside of the muscle component
I'll make it obvious right in front of the audience
My final opus is the focus of my dominance
From Spinal Tap to when I rap to building my confidence

"I'm a king with a sting of a scorpion"

[Mad Child]
Scorpion King has slowly returned

"I'm a king with the sting of a scorpion"

"I'm a king with the sting of a scorpion"
