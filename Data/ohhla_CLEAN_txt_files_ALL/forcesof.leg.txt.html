[The Grouch]
I came from the left
Kickin' harder than your breath
Force of the wind
Led from within
The sin subtracts from what I've been through
Balances out, talent no doubt
Catch it in the current
No deterrent to what I've sent you.

[Sunspot Jonz]
Sent you
Hey it's all monkey see monkey do
What's really inside of you
What's the motives to the things you do
Things you thought you knew
Nobody knows if nobody grows

[Eligh]
Reach to increase intermediate
To the top inner seeds in a medium
Untapped like a natural element
Expelled in the breeze

[Murs]
Seize the moment
These opponents
They really don't want it
I mean why put it out if your ass don't own it

[Bicasso]
And then they write it down and journalize
Speculate and generalize
Mask your lives in all these lies
They need to realize

[Aesop]
Look between ya eyes this life ain't free man
Ya got to pay for what you need.

[Sunspot Jonz]
Cross the deadly sea
To live eternally

[PSC]
Tidal waving saving both coasts like we need
A coastguard, striking hard
Lightening force we the force...

[Eligh]
Powerful potions spread across
Globes on a map through
The windy moss
The oceans holding the answers lost

[Scarub]
Deal with the cost
Find what's lost
Who wants to be found?
So many want to be fly but stand on shaky ground
(repeat)

[PSC]
Earth quaking braking down the walls of society
Lie to me; tell me that it's all right all night

[The Grouch]
All tight like a twister
Mister I'm your master
Faster than a flash flood
Taking blood in disasters

[Murs]
And after they donate
The dead hands will pronate
And FEMA might come through
But they always show late

[Aesop]
These fates will force ya
Have ya racin' like a Porsche
High powered outa control
Of the talents that you hold

[Scarub]
Marsupial thoughts
Ideas tucked down underneath the skull cap
Clung to the main frame
With a sharp aim
My life force is a push
And a push is like a shove
At times it's disastrous
But it's all done for the love

[Chorus: Bicasso - repeat 3X]
It's the forces of nature
They be pushin' thru the winds
Pushin' thru these lives that were in
This touch of life as it begins
When we be kickin' it with folks and our friends
It's in our nature, it's in our nature

[PSC]
Since, I feel we really been blessed by the goddess
Man we best to stay modest
Humble like the tumbleweeds that travel cross the brain
Roaming on the plains of your thoughts
Feel the wind gust feel us when we gots..

[The Grouch]
A gift of speech
Kids could reach in, pull up their chins
Challenge gravity
Opposite of a cavity, build
Ain't no time to yield, feel the thrill
When you're out of forces you're at a standstill

[Aesop]
Yes the fans will follow
If your soul's not hollow
Shallow like a wade pool
Got ya feelin' like a fake fool
Decisions that'll brake you
Make you realize the stakes fool
This is what the force will do!!!

[Scarub]
Make you see what's real, and wipe off the residue
I vow to flow fresh and forever stay true
Doing what I got to do, doing what I want to do
The opposite of a faker, it's the forces of nature

[Eligh]
Tapping me with taxes isn't natural
My axis is an actual attraction
To the earth that I've been trapped in

[PSC]
In dilapidated fractions of the masses
We're attractin'
Quite magnetic we pull
If ya stuck in the rut
We make happen, forces tapping
On your soul, life windows
That's fogged up and clogged up blah blah blah

[Chorus: Bicasso - repeat 3X]
It's the forces of nature
They be pushin' thru the winds
Pushin' thru these lives that we're in
This touch of life as it begins
When we be kickin' it with folks and our friends
It's in our nature, it's in our nature</pre>
