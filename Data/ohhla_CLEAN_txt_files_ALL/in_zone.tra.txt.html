You are watching a master, at work...

[Trae]
Waking up early in the evening, ready to start up my day
Hop out the bed and hit the shower, eyes dozing away
Thirty minutes flew away, and now I'm back on my track
My mouth fresh diamonds shining, I don't know how to act
But what do you know, some broad was still laying in my bed
I ain't gon lie and I say I fucked, but I recall receiving head
But that's another note, get your ass up I gotta burn out
And if you make me late, you ain't gon like the way this turn out
Ten minutes later, get the keys and I'm out the do'
Hop in a black on black, I'm thinking fast but I'm crawling slow
Private calls hit my cell, but all they gon get is the dial tone
Since Ruben ex bitch, wanna keep playing on my phone
Have ninety-nine problems, but the hate ain't one
Fuck it the cash ain't either, so I'm strapped with a gun
I hit the West on the tip, while I'm flipping a '59
Eyes covered by the locs, cause these diamonds be known to blind
I rep the West like the captain, with the general who in charge
Ain't nobody got no problems, since they know my entourage
In the blue or either red, well acquainted with the D's
From the North to the South, tops crawling more than these
See I'm the youth of the West, my nigga pimping ain't a thang
Plus my swagger kinda gangsta, so the city know my name
More than life in the hood, got me looking like a star
Plus they go to bat for Trae, like I was dying in a war
Conversating with Pimpin' Ken, or maybe Good Game
Telling me to pimp a bitch, and I can get some good change
Half the world wanna see, what's finna be my next move
But my next move will show you, how I make the rest groove
Just another type of note, that a playa can show ya
If you relate us to the good, and if not I don't know ya
I show the South, everytime a nigga peep my style
I'm classified as a mack, check my playa file

(*talking*)
Huh, know pimping ain't a thang over here homie
Yeah we straight, but you know we playa at the same time
This next verse here, is for them hating ass niggaz
Who can't get they shit straight, and they bitch choose a G
Then they wanna get mad, wanna beat the bitch up I'ma give you niggaz some game

[Trae]
On the cool I fuck a lot of hoes daily, these niggaz turn shady
If they find out that they hoes, wanna pay me
Never ever will they play me cause I'm G made, I don't need a broad
I'd rather sit and cap with niggaz, part time on the 'vard
Only woman that I love, is my mama
On a bitch that I'm gripping, will a nigga feel the drama peep the game hater
I'ma tell you, like a nigga told me
Get the cash and keep it playa, niggaz fly in these streets
I never ever saw the rings, but I swear these niggaz cuffing
Talking tough from a distance, but they heart done got em bluffing
Should I click, guess I need to continue my mission
Plus you hoes ain't on my level, I'm pimping while you be wishing
I got the cars and the house, wardrobe so Asshole
Plus I'm on my game, well acquainted with the cash flow
And if I quit, it's gon be hell to see my son
Cause it's all inside my genes, baby Neek finna come

(*talking*)
And that's real talk, right there homie
Real playas do real playa thangs, know I'm saying
Nigga don't get mad, you wanna go give your bitch a black eye
And a busted lip, and she chose a G
Or wanna ride on side a G, and look good for a second
Get your game face on nigga, nigga be tripping me out with this bullshit
How the fuck you gon have a bitch, and wanna box that hoe like a nigga
But when you catch the nigga in the street, you tal'n bout uh
It was a misunderstanding who do this and that, come on mayn
Get your shit together, for real see me in these streets nigga
Asshole By nature ha-ha, you niggaz be tripping me out mayn
That's what that is, you niggaz is marks mayn
Ol' pile of pimping ass niggaz mayn, matter fact give me the powder
I'm finna slap the shit, out one of these hoe ass niggaz</pre>
