[Intro: Revolutionary]
Today we are together, we are unified and on runnin' cower
When we are together we got power
That is why we gathered today, celebratin' our own....

[Chuck D]
We spit flows on foes 
Listen to the message that you never know 
Got a plan for the man and it's federal 
The rhyme animal, back to play the part again 
Clear the madness, and put the message in 
D, the Enemy is back to rip the mic 
We come together, so don't believe the hype 
Check my tone, there's a war here at home 
We united and strong, and never move alone 

[Paris]
We rep justice, equality and freedom now 
Put fam first, man, woman and child 
Never mild, keep it hostile 'til we raise 
Where we say, what we mean and we mean what we say 
It's been a long time comin' that we mob as one 
Guerrilla Funk, Hard Truth nigga, that's what's up 
No peace on the street 'til the justice come 
From the ballot to the bullet, if it's on, it's on 

[Chorus: Paris]
I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
See, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
Believe, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My brother, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
That's real talk on the one 

[Professor Griff]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, I'm a target, I got proof
My buildin' got an 'X' on it 
Bloomberg threw the hex on it
It's like a pistol with effects on it 
On a nigga with arrest warrants 
Hittin' pigs in their chests Quadrant where they vest wasn't 
Now he dead cousin 
All you snitches hit the red buttons, we some Uncle-Tom killers 
Mini-nina concealers, political cap-peelers for this freedom for rilla 

[Dead Prez]
Yo, if police stop the whip you got to eat them trees 
I ain't got no 'G' to give it to them crackers and court fees 
You know my steez, security first, prepare for the worst 
Never caught slippin' if you stay on alert 
Malcolm X said send them to the cemetery if they touch you 
A revolutionary virtue, a dull blade'll hurt you 
I'm up early workin' my machete 
In war, it ain't no warning, you just got to be ready 

[Chorus: Dead Prez w/ Minor Variations]
I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My nigga, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My nigga, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
You see, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me, yeah, uha

[KAM]
Yeah, my nigga it's bigger than rap
You really think you gon' be left alone 
On sayin' that you believe and ain't gon' have to get your scrap on? 
Then yap on, and will see if that's the right route 
While I get my clap on and turn niggas' lights out 
I tried to be nice, now we gon' have to bleed them 
I'm willin' to do a killin' for the price of freedom "that's right"
Comin' from the left, nigga, hood is how we kept it "right"
So prison or death is just somethin' I done accepted 
So we'll murder a snake, and we'll kill a skunk "that's right"
This ain't the word of a fake, it's Guerrilla Funk 
So right now is the time and you turf the location 
Y'all about to see the Rebirth Of a Nation 
Even if some got de-rebelized 
The revolution still will not be televised 
U.S. Government tellin' hell of lies 
And it's evident, when you look in this president's devil eyes 

[Chorus: KAM w/ Minor Variations] 
I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
Yeah, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
No homie, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My brother, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me

[Paris]
That's real talk on the one 

[Outro: Revolutionary]
That is why, I challenged you now
To stand together, raise your fists together
And engage in our national black messiness
Do it courage and determination..
I AM, "I AM" - SOMEBODY "SOMEBODY"
I AM, "I AM" - SOMEBODY "SOMEBODY"
I LIVE IN POOR "I LIVE IN POOR"
BUT I AM, "BUT I AM"  SOMEBODY "SOMEBODY"
I NEED YOUR WELFARE "I NEED YOUR WELFARE"
BUT I AM, "I AM"  SOMEBODY "SOMEBODY"
I'm MAYBE YOUR SEAL "I'M MAYBE YOUR SEAL"
BUT I AM, "BUT I AM"  SOMEBODY "SOMEBODY"
I AM "I AM" BLACK "BLACK" BEAUTIFUL "BEAUTIFUL" RAW "RAW"
I MUST BE EFFECTIVE "I MUST BE EFFECTIVE"
I MUST BE PROTECTED " I MUST BE PROTECTED"
WHAT TIME IS IT? "UNIFICATION"
WHEN WE STAND TOGETHER, WHAT TIME IS IT?
WHEN WE SAY NO MORE ??? WHAT TIME IS IT?
WHAT TIME IS IT?
WHAT TIME IS IT?
