[Intro: Popa Chief]
If it don't stick to the wall, I don't want it
Take that back... never, never, never, never
Never, never, never... aaoow

[Hook 2X: Popa Chief]
Two packs of strawberry Phillies, a case of elephants
The onion butt stick to the wall, I'm in the element
The DJ's on fire tonight, the DJ's on fire tonight

[Popa Chief]
Aiyo, the slang game is mine, the aim game is mine
I go to any spot, and get a dub for a dime
Niggas get off the mic and leave a gang of Nickelodeon slime
I get on the mic and I don't waste no time
Illuminate like sunshine, my brain works in mysterious ways
My intent is to flood the industry with verbal trays
Succulant rap styles, to make your anthems
Water prefusely, I smoke blunts, MC's, wraps and lucies
2003 pennies, in the land of milk and honey
It's the combination of loot and lenny, and I need money
Popa Chief, considered like hustle man
Pocket full of CD's and tapes, that's my hustle, man
I'm not a violent man, but never test my tan
The only ones I let live is the ones who pray
Popa Chief got them bomb ass beats, what you mean
This gear sheet, ain't no other white meat

[Chorus 2X: Popa Chief]
Two packs of strawberry Phillies, a case of elephants
The onion that stick to the wall, I'm in the element
The DJ's on fire tonight, and he's killing it
Pocket full of cold cuts and some dough, that's what we working with

[Popa Chief]
Popa Chief up in the club like I'm on duty
Stalking this booty, connected to this cutie, a thing of beauty
Ran down on her like Hawaii Five-O
You live though, she said 'ooh, that's my song, yo'
Grabbed me by the crotch and led me to the dance floor
We danced so close, I could of sworn we had sex, yo
Hands up in the air, cuz she squeezing my sex pistol
Whispered in my ear; "get your shit, and let's go
It's wack up in this place, meet at the front door"
Ok, hold up, I know some other shorties who wanna go
Now all up in the hot tub, three hoes, no clothes
Other niggas would of froze, Popa Chief struck a pose
Toast to all my foes, shotguns up the nose
Popa Chief is extra nice with the water hose
You can tell by my feet, my hands, my game, my bulge
I try not to never overindulge
2003 penny.. a combination of loot and lenny, and I need money
I need money... I gets my hustle in, man

[Hook]

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Popa Chief]
Pocks full of magnums, that's what we working with
Case of elephants, that's what we working with
Two packs of strawberry Phillies.. bull rider...</pre>
