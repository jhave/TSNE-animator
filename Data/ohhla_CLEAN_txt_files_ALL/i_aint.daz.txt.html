Typed by: da_thug88@excite.com

(Verse 1-JT The Bigga Figga)
You talkin big like you feelin the Figg
You at the crib where the safe is in
You got a jig with a half a wig
Can't even stop when I coast on dubbs
Baby boo's tryin to mug, half gone off the scrubs
With a phone full of bugs, I'm doin my thang
And I gotta get my cheddar cuz I'm true in the game
Been iced up, wrist's is froze, switch the clothes
Another Esko, with them chips exposed
I'm a bay cat
Nothin but grindin to get the money on this late night shit
Big timin it ain't funny
Quit, playin games or get out of the range
Cuz I'm tryin to do the thang, and you wanna do the same

(Chorus X2)
(LaJoi) Don't even try to clown
(JT) I know you want a boss like me
(LaJoi) Don't even come around 
(JT) Comin through on dubbs
(LaJoi) Cuz I ain't tryin to hear it
(JT) We'll see

(Verse 2-JT The Bigga Figga)
You know you want a real one game and all
When you stopped me in the parking lot at Macy's mall
With a sack full of Rocawear bag at your clothes
And my peanut butter Timbo's be makin me slow
Exchanged numbers for the first time you got your chance
And you been 7 months, without no man
Put my number on the back of your hand I got ghosts
To the spot where we cookin them beats I got dough
Far from bein broke so the time was spent
Every time gettin bent, have a shoppin event
You like gettin laced, with the finest of thangs
'Till you wanna start arguing and playin them games

(Chorus X2)
(LaJoi) Don't even try to clown
(JT) You know you want a boss like me
(LaJoi) Don't even come around 
(JT) Comin through on dubbs
(LaJoi) Cuz I ain't tryin to hear it
(JT) We'll see

(Verse 3-JT The Bigga Figga)
You let your acts be your reason for treason you sold out
On my 30 day tour you couldn't--hold out
Gettin--blowed out, with quarters and eighths
In a boat on a lake, with a cat named Jake
Is that the fate of this union goin tic-for-tac
And you told my little brother that you gettin me back
For all the dirt that I done now you cut your losses
Now you pickin and choosin from the rest of the bosses
Never thought you would take it, to this extreme
When you used to be the draft pick, on my team
Keep it clean, surprised when I got in deeper
Now since you actin up I don't need you neither

(Chorus X4)
(LaJoi) Don't even try to clown
(JT) I know you want a boss like me
(LaJoi) Don't even come around 
(JT) Comin through on dubbs
(LaJoi) Cuz I ain't tryin to hear it
(JT) We'll see</pre>
