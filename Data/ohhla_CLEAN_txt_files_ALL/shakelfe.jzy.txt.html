Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Got a million on my mind while I'm brushing my teeth
Say the hustlers prayer than I'm back to these streets
A million muthafuckers throwin salt on my name
A million muthafuckers throwin salt on my game
Can't hear you bitch ass niggaz yeah I'm sorry
Too busy switchin these gears in my Ferrari
Roof do gymnastics, shits like magic
Life like traffic, this shit here classic
Worked the Nino Brown, went to chill in the Bahamas
I was all in the hood, got some head in the Bahama's
Why you smokin' 'bout a six? It suppress my pain
Talk about a real nigga when you mention my name
I'm a simple man, want the money, fuck fame
While you stay the same, everybody else change
Oh nooo but I'm going out tonight though
And drink til I'm fucked up like them white folks

[Chorus]
I know it look bad, its gon be alright
Keep them bottles coming we gon be here all night
Roll them swishas up, we about to take flight
Need a set of new dice yeah, I'm 'bout the shake life
'bout the shake life
Yeah I'm 'bout the shake life
'bout the shake life
Yeah we 'bout the shake life
And live every night like it's Friday night
Need a set of new dice
We 'bout the shake life

[Verse 2]
I'm 'bout the shake life that's word to my momma
The work come in, yeah its on Your Honour
Give me all the time in the World and I quote
You give me a hundred years but I won't be broke
When you broke, treat you like a bad joke
Niggaz laugh at you when they know it ain't funny
Government playin' round with everybody money
Got us brainwashed so we all big dummies
War in these streets everyday like Libya
Will I get shot in the head? it's like Trivia
CNN tryna get us to hate all the Muslims
Them niggaz never talkin the truth so don't trust 'em
Niggaz out there die about true religion
Young niggaz over here dying over True Religions
So fuck it all I'm going out tonight though
Drink til I'm fucked up like them white folks

[Chorus]
I know it look bad, its gon be a'ight
Keep them bottles coming we gon be here all night
Roll them swishas up, we about to take flight
Need a set of new dice yeah, I'm 'bout the shake life
'bout the shake life
Yeah I'm 'bout the shake life
'bout the shake life
Yeah we 'bout the shake life
And live every night like it's Friday night
Need a set of new dice
We 'bout the shake life

[Verse 3]
Supposed to live everyday just like it's your last
Smile at these suckers while you spending your cash
Ball til you fall, how long it's gon last
The only thing that matters is how long is your cash
So holla when you see me out stuntin in these cars
When you looking at a niggaz do you niggaz see my scars
Stab me in the back, that's right the game cut me
I got it all but lost all my dogs, the game fucked me
Some in cemeteries, and the rest got 30
Why I'm so clean tonight cause life dirty
These jockin ass rappers tryna jock my fresh
Remind me of seventh grade, when they was jockin' my Guess
I ain't gonna lie, shit I had it back then
8 for an O, I can lease bout 10
So fuck it all shit I'm going out tonight though
And drink til I'm fucked up like them white folk

[Chorus]</pre>
