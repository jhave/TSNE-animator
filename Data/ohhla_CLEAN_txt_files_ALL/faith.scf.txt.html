[ VERSE 1 ]
Deep in the mind that wide opens
Right here we stand alive, we live focused
We open-minded, still we die hopeless
With our pride broken and bullet holes covered where we stay at
And everybody's playing for keeps, most people pray that
We all make it up out this godforsaken place that we've been all faced with
We take our chances but they all wasted
And once again you see me (marching, mobbing)
But how long must I continue to see my homies dodgin these marksmen
The whole nine put on the line but never in mind to become the head sergeant
We all targets, the votes are in, but they ain't ours
We got these politicians running their game to regain power
While our whole black community sours
Crime rate towers, plagued by white powders
And they claim to helping us to clean up our community
But ain't no open opportunities, impunity
Is what these demons use to regulate
We keep in mind we can run but we can't hide cause the streets we walk are never safe
Still all my shattered hopes and dreams remain scattered
Broken into thousands of pieces, smashed and tattered
But it don't matter, hipocrisy in your democracy
Is stopping me, so I'm retaliating properly
Theologically, society has got me pressured by the hate
And Heaven knows I have faith, I have faith

(I just wanna celebrate)	--&gt; Rare Earth
(I just wanna celebrate)
Have faith
(I just wanna celebrate)
(I just wanna celebrate)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Rudely awaken from this bad dream
Thinking my conscience wants to tell me something because of these bad things
(Past things) got me in the center of these mad dreams
(Flashing) homicidal ( ? ) fatal slashings
Now I'm asking: explain to me these visionaries Brad's seen
(Past things) sad things killed him cause he had dreams
(A sad scene) but all I ever wanted was my mind back
Now I'm that nigga trying to find out where his mind's at
The time that it took myself to figure out my mind's gone
My mind crack, slide back, look at all the time gone
Rewind back, comeback, understand my life gon' make these cuts that won't change
But things look so strange, the plague 
I gots to get myself up out the frame
Try to maintain the same game flipping 10 and flame Jane
A damn shame, people gots to always check your background
To jack now, come jack now and I'ma leave you flat down
Come back now or back down, homie, this is always all day
(Killer) in these dark and lonely hallways
Cause all they wanna see is all us brothers boxed up in caskets
With plastic bags in every bathroom getting blasted
It's drastic, mama help me calm down cause your son's sick
Don't watch me get gunned down for the dumb shit
Then the gun click and now I see the other side of black space
My last day, sad case, Heaven knows I have faith

(I just wanna celebrate)
(I just wanna celebrate)
(I just wanna celebrate)
(I just wanna celebrate)

[ VERSE 3 ]
New day brings about change, everybody's searching for the light
The daydream schemes of living life
Has got us tossed up, believing we controlling our motions
Got the answer in space beside the view behind the ocean
And adapting to the everyday struggle's got us stressed
Cause the fact we know we here one day and could die the next
You've insisted to take equipment to the solar system
Trying to ensure your sole existence
Now tell me: do you think that when the bang goes boom
You can pack up all your things and aim for the moon?
It's unlikely, but you might be equipped with with proceeds to save lives
But you die when the King say die
You can race it but you can't shake it, stop trying
Try to hide it, cause you can't face it but you're born dying
God, please forgive us cause we're human not perfect
And the devil try to fronting but it's not working
How can we all sit suspended in space
Just spinning in place and ain't extended in faith
Man, wait -

(I just wanna celebrate)
(I just wanna celebrate)
(I just wanna celebrate)
