Speaking on sandwiches kinda fickle
She can be white or wheat, or even pumpernickel
She don't even walk around bein discreet uhh
On the contrar(y), she walks around lookin for the meat
Or, lett-uce pray, tomato cheese pickle
Mustard, ketchup, two black olives man
Mayonnaise your hands off of it
Punk, you understand?
I don't think so cause these freaks keep on bothering me
You don't know so cause these freaks keep on pestering me
Something's gotta boil up my bone they won't let me b-ah-be
Huh, yeah
I don't think so cause these freaks keep on bothering me
You don't know so cause these freaks keep on pestering me
Something's gotta boil up my bone they won't let me b-ah-be
Ha-ay, that's why

Girlie, you're treating me fowl like a rooster
But I Boo-Yaa, gusto me gusta
I'm sick and tired so you fired I don't want you no more
you snore furthermore you're rotten to the core
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
are some of the girls that LL knows from around the way
I know some [hoes], that will always give up the play
But I don't want that, so I should go where LL stay, huh
To find that cutie with that nice fat booty
so I can do my duty, and she will smile like Tudy
From the Facts of Life that used to be on NBC
However recently you've got to catch the repeats G, uh
Back to the issue at hand understand I am a man
who can burn you like a fryin pan, more dangerous than quicksand
Proud to be black, I'm a meal, not a snack
You want to put me on wax?  But that's why
