[Chorus] [x2]
It was me, not you, I built this
I'm takin' all the credit
You mad, you can go and get your own
Earn my right to be selfish
This is all mine
You mad, you can go and get your own

[Verse One] [Joe Scudda]
I do my own thang
Be on my own grind
Move at my own pace
Be on my own time
Got the right words
But at the wrong time
My girl left me, couldn't give her alone time
She called me, "Selfish"
Guess I inherited it
Well fuck her, I don't need her
How's that for arrogant?
I'm bout to go back
To how I used to be
If you don't like it, fuck it, better get used to me
To many fake friends
You can't please 'em all
You start shakin' the tree, I bet the leaves will fall
And the ones that don't, they the ones you keep
The ones that do, the ones that can beat the street
Tell 'em, "Kick rocks"
Two fingers homie
We don't gotta be cool
I don't need ya homie
I'm a grown man
Get it a grown way
So I don't do it if I can't do it my own way

[Chorus] [x2]
It was me, not you, I built this
I'm takin' all the credit
You mad, you can go and get your own
Earn my right to be selfish
This is all mine
You mad, you can go and get your own

[Verse Two] [Chaundon]
It's all about Chaundon, that's all my eyes can see
There's no 'I' in team but there's always 'me'
Cause I'm the one to get myself out that 9 to 5
Live in the house I want, into the car I drive
I can't lie
I'm not that dude
To wait for another nigga just to make moves
Gamble with my shit? Supposin' niggas loose
It back to the hood, naw nigga I refuse
Came into the world all by myself
And when God call I'm in the casket, by myself
Damn right it's all about me, myself and I
And it's lonely at the top, don't worry, I'll get by
Cause it's my blood, sweat and tears that got me through it
It was I that inspired myself to go and do it
No need to remind me that I'm on that next shit
Who built this? Me, that's who, I'm selfish

[Chorus] [x2]
It was me, not you, I built this
I'm takin' all the credit
You mad, you can go and get your own
Earn my right to be selfish
This is all mine
You mad, you can go and get your own</pre>
