We were meant to be
I'm that bitch that makes you moan keeps that body hot
You were made for me
I'm that bitch that makes you moan keeps that body hot

Me and you we were meant to be
But you already have a happy family
But nigga I'm not happy cause you're not with me
And nigga she's not happy cause your loving me
Or is it lusting me or just fucking me
Nigga why you seeing me its what you wanna see
I was fool set it up on top of you
Looking good slow fucking and I'm loving you
I'm that bitch that makes you moan keeps that body hot
Real good drama love never wanna stop
I love you nigga need you nigga in my life to stay
With me forever make a way for me and you to be
Cause I don't see another nigga when it comes to you
I never need another nigga all I need is you
I know you feel me hear the love in these words I say
I want you nigga for myself we were meant to be

It was plain to see
We were meant to be
I'm that bitch that makes you moan keep that body hot
I was made for you
You were made for me
I'm that bitch that makes you moan keep that body hot

Me and you we was meant to be
I was made for you and you was made for me
Sitting home late at night sharing our hopes and dreams
Or tell me was those all lies that you told to me
When you were holding me taking control of me
Can't go home still I'm sleep cause when you're gone I'm weak
Thinking about what your doing when your home with her
Thinking about what she doing why you ain't leaving her
Cause you deceiving her you don't believe in her
You 'posed to be with me it's where you wanna be
Always going home late telling lies to her
You know I need is us together is what we both prefer
I'm that bitch that keeps you going keeps that body hot
Real good drama love never wanna stop
I love you nigga need you nigga in my life to stay
You know me and you we were meant to be

It was plain to see
We were meant to be
I'm that bitch that makes you moan keep that body hot
I was made for you
You were made for me
I'm that bitch that makes you moan keep that body hot

Call me lover friends to the end ill forever be true
Gives a fuck what they say how I'm stupid for you
I feel the joy in my heart and I know its true
I feel the bond me and you when you step in the room
See butterflies in your eyes when I'm looking at you
Feel warm inside when we lie playing sucking us too
And you show me when you smile I be wanting to cry
How you touch me deep inside I be wondering why
If it ain't meant to be if you ain't made for me
Why is it that I'm weak shit I can hardly sleep
Thinking bout what you doing while you home with her
Thinking bout what she doing why you ain't leaving her
I'm that bitch that make you moan keep that body hot
Real good drama love never wanna stop
I love you nigga need you nigga in my life to stay
With me forever make a way for me and you to be

It was plain to see
We were meant to be
I'm that bitch that makes you moan keep that body hot
I was made for you
You were made for me
I'm that bitch that makes you moan keep that body hot

It was plain to see
We were meant to be
I'm that bitch that makes you moan keep that body hot
I was made for you
You were made for me
I'm that bitch that makes you moan keep that body hot

You and me we were meant to be
I was made for you you was made for me
Baby can't you see that its killing me
I'm that bitch that makes you moan keep that body hot
I'd rather have you home with me</pre>
