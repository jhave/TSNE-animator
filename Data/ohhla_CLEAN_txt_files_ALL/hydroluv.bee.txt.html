She got that sticky icky
And man, I'm picky who I'm pokin'
She got that bomb nana like that bong that I be smokin'
Ain't no jokin', ain't no tellin' lies
You must got me fucked up
If you think I ain't in paradise
Then I'm with her
Yes sir
Best believe it's true

And that's the truth
Ain't no time for no silly kids
Up in your buis'
Recognize for what the realness is

Show you in the mirror while I beat it up
Your stuff is off the leash

When we alone
Or maybe out in public
I ain't scared to hold your hand, let 'em know how much I love it
Every inch is like a potent hit
Up in your lungs
So I'm a give you all of it
Now here it comes
And you ain't scared to call your homegirl
To make my toes curl
Three, some say nothin' to a boss when I'm in your world
So high
I get so high
It's like that purple kush, when I hit, no lie
Got you screamin' papi-san, while I'm smokin' marijuan'
And when I'm runnin' low
You so quick to get me some

Money squeezer
You love to call your boy cause he gon' please ya

The way I smoke and chill with you (Sexy eyes)
