Song:   Hot to Death
Typed by: JuwenLong@aol.com

We're gonna be breakin' it down (Yeah!)
You gotta know the feel
You gotta know the life
You know what I'm sayin' (Hey!)

I said what's goin' wrong
You know it just ain't right
Tell me who be loud
When the spark ignite
Now from the break daylight
To the fall of the sun
You gotta pick your fight
It's time to choose your gun

Chorus:
Front to back
Right to left
Keep it live all night
Make it hot to death
Get your heart pumpin' like some crystal meth
Keep it live all night
Make it hot to death

Well...
Hey...

Tell me who's your God
Does he make a lotta dough
I'm gonna take you higher
Or to the fire below

Chorus

Guns to roses
Abraham to Moses
Daylight exposes what the night conceals
Let's break these seals
And get this thing started
Some be out classed
Some be out smarted
Some be over bound by the blindin' rays
I hear the whisper in the night
Get trapped in the maze
See back in the days
When I was juvenile
I dreamed of rockin' on the mic
In a brand new style
Now I'm shakin' these bones
Tryin' to get these shoes
Outbidded major crews
I'm paid crazy dues
Now I'm speakin' on you
They just slept on me
And rumors start spreadin'
Just like a disease
I'll have you down on your knees
Below the spot ground zero
Turn brown and burn down Rome just like Nero
A hero ain't nothing but a
Don't make me say it again
Legend
Don't make me say it

Chorus

That's what I'm sayin (2x)</pre>
