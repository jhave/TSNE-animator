On the Organization and Disorganization of Files

The website at http://www.asondheim.org/ has been revamped, the portal 
(home) (index,html) page removed; instead there is a directory for the 
Internet Text with a 00README1st.txt as introduction. The result is a 
field of varied files - .txt or the double-letter files such as ab, mx, 
etc. which are also texts - various video formats (avi, mov, asf) - sound, 
programs, .exe executables, and so forth.

If there is a resulting organization, it is in the form of the name 
itself, what follows in parallel, for example the archaea series or the 
Poly series. 

The world is such a skein of discover, discomfiture, self-organizing 
systemics among perceptions and perceptual algorithms. Here, one employs 
the same; everything is available, the extensions guiding format and 
sense, the contents interrelated across extensions through parallel names.

Please check out both the http://www.asondheim.org/ and the portal 
directory at http://www.asondheim.org/portal . The latter contains more 
multi-media; the two, however, interpenetrate, connected only by the waist 
or spinal cord/chord of the directory structure itself.

The clear contents, the clarity of the contents. Fields and intensities. 
Distributivities...

in this poem i am placing one word after another
i am thinking how these words go together
the maroon sound of them in any weather
caught in the throat of clever socialness
then that line and this weren't any good
so backtrack and that's such a bother 
that i haven't any executables today or any other
this stanza has good socialness but would rather
have a machine bit here and there so as to dither
among father prose and mother poem and brother
or sister that just about rounds out familiar author
technique just an oops and backtrack and then gather
what's left an execrable lather
and then backtrack and backtrack

thinking just what combination of letters would work
i'd rather listen to or be a circle jerk
or at the very least a jerk
that might lurk and carry dirk in all this murk

how else to destroy each and every poet
without a some codework we would hardly know it
unless one were left alive to tell it
if a cat's got rhyme this time then we should bell it

"i can't escape death. it is always there. it troubles my dreams. i find 
myself dying. i find myself decaying. my body is my loss. i feel it slip 
away. i am confounded. there is nothing i can do."

"little simple romantic poem:
"Country Fire"

"the firebells bray at night;
"the countryside grows chokedly in flame;
"we attempt to flee the holocaust,
"are turned back, from the crossroads, in pain.

"in our dry light and open rafters
"we find reflected only traces
"of our being; aghast, we stare upon ourselves
"in contemplation of our hollow faces.

"from every eave, from every black, charred beam,
"from all burnt corners, all seared broken boards
"that stare exposed, no longer name a room,
"we read our parts, of chattels, not of lords."

"Cain

"Did you know what would be there, among your rotten hills?
"The vileness that destiny has pressed upon you?
"In filth and vengeance, see the crowd that mills,
"The cross upon his brow, the rain of glows!
"His eyes transfixed by spears, he staggers home;
"His claws are torn in blood, and still they come!
"His cracking body, broken teeth with foam,
"Proclaim the bawdy nights, the flow of rum.

"Wenches screaming in a thousand poses,
"Gambling wildly, in all sorts of ruses,
"Returning home to take the ready doses,
"To ease his steady pain and salve his bruises:

"Found bottle on the table, candle in the parlor;
"Knife on the bench and glass in the cupboard;
"Danced in circles with a thousand harlots,
"Feeling tense and turning, burning in the discord!

"His mother good as dead, his father gone,
"His brother in his bed in his dark room--
"He pushed aside the curtains with a groan,
"And in his wild frenzy caught his doom!

"And ours. For who can tell--that mark that lay upon him
"Might yet be our god. And now you know the rest--
"His body smashed, His heart,His eyes gouged out,
"He lies upon the Crossroads, Cain's bequest."

this one was difficult. there are too many constants that had to be set to 
prevent overflow, fill the screen, at least for the most part. rather than 
a crash. so i stopped at Crash - 1 you know. i tried to return smaller 
constant values but then everything looked wrong. besides, this seems to 
be oddly independent of screen height and width. then using twips is 
problematic. anyway we continue investigating the problematic myxomycetes

Is the Internet Dying?


Recently there has been a great deal of discussion of "Is the Internet 
Dying" which is a very controversial issue. Some say the Internet is dying 
and will not survive. Others say the Internet will continue forever and it 
is fine. I think the Internet is going through difficult times and may not 
survive. I will tell you my reasons why.

First, the Internet is very busy now with many business and this hurts 
its chance of success of surviving. For example, if you want to order a 
car, you can order the car on the Internet and even pick the color you 
want. But this makes many people use the Internet who should go out and 
enjoy the weather to see the car, and this may be a real problem.

Second, there are so many spams on the Internet, sometimes it is hard to 
find a way to read them all, and they are almost always not very good. I 
think the spams are harmful, but there are some interesting offers from 
foreign countries that sound exciting. But I think they may be "scams" and 
not real, but I do not know. They sound exciting.

But they take up so much room that sometimes I have problems finding 
emails from my friends who also write and even my family. And sometimes my 
family will write and want to know should I take up this offer they have 
received, what do I think. So it takes a lot of time and I feel I am 
drowning with so much to do in just answering these letters.

Third, I cannot watch movie on the Internet. I try, but my machine is so 
slow, the movie runs slow and I forget what I am looking at. I do not 
understand the language also when it runs slow. I think in the future they 
must speed the movies up. Then I will understand better but my machine may 
still be too slow. I do not know! but I will find out.

Fourth, there are so many language on the Internet and I cannot follow all 
of them. Sometimes I will try and translate one, but I cannot do this all 
the time and there is this important information maybe that I cannot read 
and do not know what I can do with it. I will ask my friends but maybe 
they cannot read either.

Therefore, I think the Internet is a very good thing, because there is a 
lot of information on it, and I can talk to my friends and my family, but 
I think it is maybe dying also because of the language, the slow movie, 
the spam and the business. Only time will tell!

the Resistance


the Resistance gave meaning to history
every word a password
real political economy of language
we long for those times
every word possessed a body
every body harbored the scent of death
every body breathed its last forever
those were the times

(now history carries no meaning, we're lost, causes split, fragment, 
holarchic tendrils of power carry on in spite of everything, they're 
evanescent. but we remember the days of the Resistance when our lives
had meaning and the world was impetuous and full of danger.)

An Astonishing Discovery (Preliminary Announcement)


*********


On Sun Jun  1 20:33:29 2003, I made this discovery:


Unresolved kernel trap(cpu 0): 0x300 
Latest crash info for cpu 0:
   Exception state (sv=0x103F1280)
      Backtrace:
      Kernel loadable modules in backtrace (with dependencies):

Proceeding back via exception chain:
   Exception state (sv=0x103F1280)
      previously dumped as "Latest" state. skipping...
   Exception state (sv=0x10470500)

      Backtrace:
      Kernel loadable modules in backtrace (with dependencies):
   Exception state (sv=0x10470500)


I have always wanted to make an astonishing discovery. For only through
the advancements of science, mathematics, and even technology, can
humanity progress into the future. We will never be remembered for our
imagery or music, our so-called culture, but for our realistic
achievements in understanding where we are from and where we are going,
and what the universe is truly like. Each of us in our own modest way must
contribute to this, and the above is my contribution. In this way we will
begin to understand ourselves better and the universe around us. If it
were not for mathematics, there would be no physics and no world, and I
would not be able to write this as I am doing right now.

everything i write is a hideous aberration.
my writing is filled with irresponsible language
perhaps you won't think that in the future
perhaps you will

language is absurdly melded. look, i read the eighteenth century as well
as the next person. look, it's outdated, already lost. just so my own work
will be seen as a "hideous aberration."

my writing will be irresponsible or dated beyond belief. quaint.
