[Intro]
My dogs on the block, my dogs in the game
Them dogs locked up doin time in the jail
My dogs on the streets, my dogs in the hood
My dogs in the project up to no good
My dogs - I ride for my dogs
I'll die for my dogs, this one for my dogs

[Master P]
Call me {?}, cause I'm respected in the hood
From the North, to the East, to the West, to the woods
You gon' need more than a {?} shot, if I fight
You don't say it how it go then you might lose yo' life
I got dogs, that I mash up and pull capes with
I got dogs that I hustle and get paper with
I got dogs that I know wanna bite me
But I live for the dog that wanna be just like me
Niggaz wanna turn, my dogs against me
And these bitch dogs, y'all can't pimp me
How you gon' fuck with {?} and don't fuck with Peedi
Every dog got his day cause most dogs is greedy

[Chorus]
I'm in the hood with my dogs, I hang with my dogs
I slang with my dogs, I bang with my dogs
I smoke with my dogs, I drink with my dogs
I roll with my dogs, my No Limit dogs

[Master P]
Most of y'all niggaz want dogs to guard 'em
C-Murder not guilty, so fuck the warden
Call the President, man give him a pardon
I got more fuckin green than the Boston Garden
My dogs on the block nigga got my back
And my dogs locked up they're ready to attack
We rottweilers in the game and y'all niggaz poodles
We flippin dog biscuits while y'all cats eatin noodles
And loyalty, come with respect
Never put friends over family, all dogs know that
We might have differences but keep it real
And we ride for the dogs if one get killed

[Chorus]

[Master P]
Let me tell you what type of dog I am
I'm the type of dog that's gon' keep it real with my dogs
I could never be a yes dog
Cause you know what I'ma be there for you dog
When you need me dog, cause you my dog
And no matter what you thank dog
When them other dogs gone, I'ma still be there barkin for you dog
Cause you my dog, and I'm yo' dog
Hope you feel me dog</pre>
