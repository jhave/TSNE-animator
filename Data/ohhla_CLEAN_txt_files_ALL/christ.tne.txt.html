(Echol until verse)
Omega! 
Whoo, woo
Yeah, Lets' do it (ha ha)
The Interpretation, man 
I preach Christ, man
Nothing more or nothing less, man (yeah) 
The King of all Kings, man
That's who I rep, man
Ain't no shame about it, man
I'm about to interpret truth to you, man
The intro, let's do it

[Verse 1]
I don't need no hook for this track 
I scream Psalms 23 and leave 'em actin' like Jordan was back
I scream Christ 'cause it's necessary
Without him, homies is dyin' 
Looking like Jay-Z; Fading to black
So I come to change perspectives
I come preachin the Christ
The true Messiah who don't hang from your necklace
I mic 2-1 check this
These dudes is unsecure wide open like the borderlines of Texas
I see you tip-tippin' dippin' curves in your Lexus
Sin got you covered from your feet to where your neck is
So we like Abraham ridin' to rescue Lot
Preaching the Good News to homies that's on your block
'Cause homies hustling hurriedly running against the clock
In custody of iniquity, check the time on your watch
You can tell that it's time for change
Go sell out to God  
And let his love nickel and dime ya, mane

[Chorus]
I don't need no hook for this
All I need is the Holy Ghost and 66 books for this
I got the cure for the crook with this
I preach Christ to the masses
And getcha off the hook with this
I don't need no hook for this
All I need is the Holy Ghost and 66 books for this
I got the cure for the crook with this
I preach Christ to the masses
And getcha off the hook with this

[Verse 2]
I preach Christ of Nazarene, dog, the Son of the blessed
The incarnated Word of God, seen in the flesh
So when he speak we listen
Cause his words bring life
Cause he's more than a prophet
He ain't David Koresh 
But he's the Truth and the Life
We down to die for the dude 
Believe in the Good news
We don't follow for the food
But we follow with a zeal, for our sins he was bruised
And we follow cause of faith, no pictures, no clues
We surrender like war criminals 
Knowing what he do
Like walkin on water
We don't even say it was the shoes
We promote man kind, except the Father of time
who tossed the demons To swine, who turned the water to wine
who give the sight to the blind 
When others wanna stone you for adultery
He kneel in the sand and draw a line 
Yeah we throw the Crosses up like it's a Piru sign
Listen homie you need the blood 
But not the Damu kind

[Chorus]

[Talking]
I preach Christ, man
The true Messiah who don't hang from you necklace
Ha ha, yeh
The one who walked on water, man 
The one who fed a multitude with bread and fish, man
I'm talkin 'bout the one who turned the water into wine
Who wasn't married to Mary Magdelene 
The real Christ, man
The true Messiah</pre>
