uh-huh, real life shit
na'mean True story
Feel me, matter of fact Still feel me
Uh yea, yo

Past few years shit got so ill
Kinda hard for the god to laugh through tears
I went through something with momma, no drama
something that came and went, real life karma
My pop think his son is deserting em, its hurtin em
Guess I gotta be the man, sit down &amp; work with em
My little boy 7, he the sequel to the thug
So I told him the money will never equal the love
Listen I'm grown y'all, when it comes to my family it's never a problem
It's only a phone call, the tend to take that and run with it
So every other month I be on some new number shit
They violated Stay again, Gus totaled the beamer &amp; broke Kay leg again
shhh, let us pray again and I ain't get enough of hanging in local bars yet
Had to let the thang off, cross town in the projects
All these rumors, shit I ain't get robbed yet
Bitch ass niggaz ain't stop actin like broads yet
And arm reach off a gun &amp; a mask, somebody clipped me for a hundred in cash
Still feel me, I hit the road try to get more grip
It was cool til' a mutha fuckin tour bus flipped
uh, no charges brought up, bitch popped up with a kid
Got caught up, then I put a court up
Now The road the the riches is taking me longer
It ain't kill yet so it makin me stronger
I don't know if its the hate, frustration, or hunger
The keep a nigga going, rappin for a reason
Shit don't just don't happen, shit happen for a reason
I'm that dude, like it or love it
I do my thang in the hood, get right with a budget
Ain't afraid to give my life to the public
And when you see me next time maybe we can further discuss
How my 16's give you a visual
I know you thinking he ain't really selling, how he life off residuals
But right now the game is pitiful
niggaz is lonely, they need company cuz they miserable

(Talking)
Yeah, uh-huh shit it still real B
That's why I want you to still feel me
Still feel me, one I'm out</pre>
