Song:   Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Chorus]
I am a sinner.. who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me.. Lord forgive me - things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone....
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music, I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my VIBE, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous; I can say that I like a challenge 
and you to me is painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this, tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Interlude]
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people around me 
just want to be famous; you can see that my city found me 
then put me on stages, to me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check with all disrespect let me say this

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you; we live in a world, we live in a world 
on two different axles; you live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to; this shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name; I'll let the people know 
this is something you can blame on yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
I'mma break out and then hide every lock, I'mma break out and then hide every lock

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Outro]
Bitch don't kill my vibe; you ain't heard a chorus 
like this in a long time - don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air I can see you are, in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Skit]
"Ay K-Dot, get in the car, nigga
Come on, we finna roll out
Got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo freestyles ready."</pre>
