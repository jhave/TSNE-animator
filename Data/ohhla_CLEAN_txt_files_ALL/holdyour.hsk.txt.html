[Ruck]
Aiyo, I never lie, rhymes is knives ready to sever guys
Never try, that nigga Ruck is a fuckin' better fly
Identify yourself, walkin' in my perimeter
I get rid of ya, with two shots from the dillinger
Bruce Willin' ta, try to step to
Tall Sean, I wet you, that's my word to my nephew
Donte, word is bond, listen to what the Gods say
Grew up the hard way, wearin' nat clothes from hallways
But now the Gods say, get that high when the tron blaze
With bum bitches that run tricks like fuckin' card games --
I shouldn't listen to what my mom say
Police squads, they can harass me, never can harm me

[Chorus: Rock]
Hold your head, boy, you know it's hard
You hold the weight of the planet, it's your job, you God
Hold your head, boy, I know the shit's still bad
Hold your head, boy, you know a nigga got your back

[Ruck]
You gotta hold on, God, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'mma try
I can't like, I'm kinda fucked up since my momma died
Can't decide right from wrong, nights too long
Seem like Big Ruck have a fight with Sean
It's like you'll never gone till, you know that
I go to the doctor for advice, he keep givin' me prozac
That's so wack, the only thing that Sean deserve
Is some weed, money and pussy, to calm my nerve --

[Rock]
Here, here, levitate on this son, what the hell
When the going gets tough? The tough puff l's
It's a known fact, whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Think I'mma let you quit you, dead wrong, bwoy
I know shit's bezerk, shit is crazy, got me holdin' heat again
Just came home, fightin' with police, again
Son, they testin' me, but never let them get the best of me
I ain't even do shit, plus I been stashed the weapon, see
The whole world a broke fool, it ain't cool
That's why in the ninety-now, the rules are 'fuck the rules'
Feel like I'm psychic, watchin' all the shit, I dream again
Make me wish I never dream, let the madness begin

[Chorus]

[Anthony Hamilton]
Hold your head up, high
Keep ya face to the sky
Things are gonna get better
After all that
Hold your head up, high
Don't let life get you down
We're always go together
I promise, we'll make it by
I promise, we'll make it by</pre>
