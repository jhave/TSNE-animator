Song:   I Wanna Get High
Typed by: OHHLA.com

I want to get high - so high!
I want to get high - so high!
I want to get high - so high!
I want to get high - so high!

Well that's the funk elastic, the blunt I twist it
The slamafied, bonafied funk on your discus
Oh, what you messed with, you got to bear witness
Catch a ho and another ho Merry Christmas
Yes I smoke shit, straight off the roach clip
I roach it roll the blunt at once  to approach it
Forward motion make you sway like the ocean
The herb is more than just a powerful potion
What's the commotion, yo I'm not joking around
People learning about, what they're smoking
My oven is on high, when I roast the quail
Tell Bill Clinton to go and inhale
Exhale, now you felt the funk of the power
now feel the effects...

I want to get high - so high!
I want to get high - so high!
I want to get high - so high!
I want to get high - so high!
Yo hits from the bong
Yo hits from the bong
Yo hits from the bong
Yo hits from the from the bong from the bong
Yo hits from the bong
Yo hits from the from the bong from the bong
Yo hits from the from the bong from the bong</pre>
