[RZA]
The body is a vehicle for the mind
You realize that your body, is basically vacumnin that space
into somethin from within this body
This is why the air must come in, every breath
Look at - I say look at ODB, okay
A free man for real, knahmsayin?
His his expression of freedom, his what he wanted to do
It was VERY free, one out of a million people
could deter him, from an idea, y'knahmean?
Cause he was free to express like that, y'knahmean?</pre>
