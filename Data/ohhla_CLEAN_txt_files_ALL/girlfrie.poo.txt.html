[Chorus]
Girlfriend, boyfriend
If we together then tell me who's him?
Boyfriend, girlfriend
If we together then tell me who's him?

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Knock, knock, knockin at the front door
If we together then tell me what you cryin fo'?
Why you all upset? What you lyin fo'?
I'm just tryin to figure out who this nigga is
Better tell me somethin better than he here for biz
Now I got a few questions, pop quiz
Please tell me this his first time at the crib
Matter fact, why the FUCK he know where we live?!
Oh I get it, try to catch me at the studio
So you could run around, play the little house hoe
And to think I almost made you my spouse yo
I couldn't DREAM of this shit that I'm goin thru
I put my life on the back burner just for you
I believe what niggas told me wasn't true
And to think this whole time I was playin the fool
Put you out, put ya dumb-ass back in school

[Chorus]
Girlfriend, boyfriend
If we together then tell me who's him?
Boyfriend, girlfriend
If we together then tell me who's him?
Knock, knock, knockin at the front door
If we together then tell me what you lyin fo'?
Girlfriend, boyfriend
If we together then tell me who's him?

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yeah, I packed everything you came with
The trash bag by the door, you a lame bitch
I hope that nigga turn around and do the same shit
Had ya heart broken up, that's how the game is
Yeah, I'm on my Oran "Juice" Jones
+The Rain+ is the tears you can cry when I'm gone
Luther told me that +A House Ain't a Home+
when you cain't even trust ya main bitch with a clone?
How'd you let me find your secret out? No phone, tapped
The furs, the jewels, I need it all, back
Mater of fact, I'm thru talkin
That nigga waitin for you outside, START walkin!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Gi-gi, g-g-girlfriend
Bo-bo, b-b-boyfriend
Gi-gi, g-g-girlfriend
If we together, then tell me who's him?</pre>
