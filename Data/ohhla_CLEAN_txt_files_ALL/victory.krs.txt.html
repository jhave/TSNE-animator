[KRS-One]
KRS, Wild Style'n today
I stay controversial like Guatanamo Bay
My society is secret, sort of like the boulet
I'm not a average MC, I don't say what they say
I don't play what they play; I'm the type to find the needle
at the bottom of hay, that's why I'm rockin today
Often they say "No way!" Until I say
Da-da-da-day and the crowd go HEY~!!
From the time I stepped in the game
Kris been clear 'bout his rep and his name
I don't tolerate disrespect to my name
To uplift my people that's the reason I came
If you believe in peace then we believe in the same
If you believe in war I got that tec for your brain
If you think I'm a whore man you must be insane
I'm war in reverse like Big Daddy Kane - RAW!!!

[Blaq Poet]
I know y'all motherfuckers ain't gon' believe this
Poet on the track with the nigga that dissed Queensbridge~?!
Let me show y'all how to bury the hatchet
The Blastmaster, with the Black Bastard, a classic (C'MON!!)
This is one for your dome
Niggaz must understand, it's hip-hop full blown!
Gimme the mic (what) I'ma stay shittin
I'ma stay rippin and banana clip spittin
Niggaz know, Blaq Po', green beret flow
It's nuttin to me, I do it all day yo
The victory is almost here
I'm at the front line, yo Kris pull up on they rear (YEA)
We got the shit surrounded, time to wild out
Nigga what you wan' do, nigga don't ask me, this is your LP
Marley hollered at Preem, Preem hollered at me
Now I'm standin here warrior, reppin QB (bo! bo! bo! bo! bo!)
Nigga what's really good, what it's gon' be

[KRS] Poet, rock on!

This ain't what you're used to
KRS-One, Marley Marl, BDP with the Juice Crew
Who knew? 20 years after Scott
Marley Marl would pass the rock
And I'd dribble it, dribble it, livin it
Nibble it a little bit before I enter the club and start killin it
K-R-R-R, S-wah-wah-One
Yes they'd be the stars, me I'd be the sun
Jump right off the stage, breakin breakin you off
KRS is the best, of c-c-c-course
Street to the c-core, down by l-law
You the #1 MC, oh shit-sh-sure
Meet me at the c-club, if you thinkin you thug
KRS and Poet, this the type of hip-hop you love!!
