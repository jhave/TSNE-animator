"Once again, ladies and gentlemen 
We would like to say good evening to you 
And wel-welcome, coming to you tonight from--" 
"PHILLY" 
"Blackberry" 
"Records presenting to you these very talented artists" 

[Grand Agent] *whispering* 
Stay on point and you'll get yours 
The Good Lord unlocks many doors 
See God don't change us, players because the devil ? 
I'm telling you 

It's the hands free, hurt you virtue 
Patience, I been chillin where you make your mistakes friend 
I mean I be building where you renting your space see 
I'm clean, all I ever had was my horses was for the reign 
Grand stay clear of slander, its naked to see 
That you a fake, when I talk about me, the lawfully wed 
I've read six bars written over three days 
Spittin em two or three ways, perfectin the phrase 
Never on some "hurry up and wait for a plate" 
I'll eat what's available, my fate is unjailable 
Patron saint of the flow, you're like "say it ain't so" 
I'm full circle though, no way to corner me 
And I'll be right here ridin camels through the eye 
A brainstorm buyin time like Superfly 
So I can smell the roses in the rap narration 
Of my legend, twenty five years in the making 

[Chorus] 4x 
"Taking the time"  "To make the right rhyme" 
"I spend time with the rhyme" 

[Grand Agent] 
I dreamed of being seventeen up in the magazine 
On my most Special Ed, but that wasn't even half the dream 
Shoulda seen the cream I had eyes for, the hots for 
Hard dick lyrics bangin on the locked door 
That this nigga named "In" rest beyond for a long time 
Though we wouldn't even correspond 
So it was just me, propostionin Mr. 'Dustry [industry] 
Like "trust me, it's way husky" 
I got the hottest rhyme book around 
I cook the sound medium rare 
Let the big snares blare 
I live and breathe this, Mr. In Dustry just 
Give a listen, you can find out what you been missin 
Total package with the golden options 
I can leap over lies and mash down doctrines 
He wasn't even hearin that 
That's okay though, it came the time to analyze the cliche that goes 

Haste makes waste 
Walk don't run, take time to be safe 
Fuck around and get egg all on your face 
Pace yourself son, PACE 
Your body just pace 
Cuz you could work hard and never blow 
Or you could work smart and better your flow 
You can't hurry game though 
You fuck around and get egg on your face 
So pace, your body just pace 

Chorus 4x 

[Grand Agent] 
And look, you don't understand, I don't understand either 
How the cornballs come to commandeer the receiver 
Used to be a time when a rhyme couldn't fly if it wasn't fly 
Now, you gotta pray a man doesn't die 
A dis record is a dangerous thing 
Nowadays, not to say your instincts ain't to trust but fame 
It ain't to be gotten dick ridin 
That's basically what you be on 
When you spend breath to scorn 
Let the wack dudes be the wack dudes 
Cuz the wack dudes can't touch dudes with the real aptitude 
Rhyme victory raps that patience is the author of 
The wack dudes burn fast like sparklers 
So they be out your way in no time 
And you be still gettin dap while them suckers see no shine 
It's for the best with no blood on your hands 
Hence, the hands-free hurt you virtue 
Patience
