[Lil' Fame]
Suppose we go in your clothes and take your doughs

[Billy Danze]
After that hit you in your back with the deuce-fo'
Heistmaster, known to cause disaster
Robbed the world, in ten minutes, or faster
{Head 'em up!} Move 'em out {Ay nigga it's time to leave}
Duke in the fatigue got somethin up his sleeve
Strapped made a move towards me while we was breakin North
{Yeah, I tore his motherfuckin wig off}
