[Hi-Tek]
(Uhh) Yeah, yo Kweli whattup? (Uhh)
Time to get this dough man, what's happenin?
Tell 'em about New York son man

[Talib Kweli]
New York red hot in the summer and blue in the cold winter
In the 'Natti they roll spinners, be coolin the most Dennis
You know the flows in this, tone is a known menace
When we come switch from 'em we finish to "None of Yo' Business"
Where I'm from we don't be talkin loud, that's cause we walkin proud
More black rain fallin from the clouds soon as I saw the crowd
All the liquor started pourin out, bodies they chalkin out
Kweli the Great they're callin out, that's what I'm talkin 'bout
Pneumatic like a phone I gotta roam a dog got a bone
I still gotta get though, I'm gettin grown
I'm plottin on a plot to own, stock up on supplies 'til the deal
Cross the T, dot the I, signed a contract, get a contact
Y'all niggaz secondhand I come to discover
You runnin for cover kid your rhymes is hand-me-down like older brothers
They gon' bug us, we save the lives of the young among us
And your boy still got that hunger, you gotta love us

[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
They say the time is now, the place is here
Don't be a scary muh'fucker, stay and face your fear
After they pick up, the body momma trace the tear
This is a stick up, get them damn hands in the air!
Yeah the time is now, the place is here
Don't be a scary muh'fucker nigga face your fear
After they pick up, the body momma trace the tear
This is a stick up, get them damn hands in the air! Yeah

[Hi-Tek]
This 'Natti shit nervous street corner feet hurtin
Hustlin, do it and askin God what's my soul purpose
I'm stayin in the lab, my life is up for grabs
As soon as I slip niggaz gon' criticize my ass
Fuck 'em I'ma keep puffin Hi-Tek stackin thousands
Niggaz hated when they heard me on that 50 album
The streets is callin when my nigga tell me he need a boost
And bring him a pack, cause he know my roots

[Chorus] - immediately fades to end</pre>
