[Chorus: 50 Cent]
{"Can't help myself, I can't help myself"}
I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a muh'fucker
{"I can't help myself, I can't help myself"}
I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a muh'fucker

[50 Cent]
I had 500 packs, 14 grams of powder
On the phone with my connect, this shit last about a hour
I need work, I repeat, I need work
My niggaz go berserk, when the drought come get murked
When no money comin in is when the guns come out
Why the D's wanna sit in front of my momma house
You know it's sorta like some shit you seen in a flick
Black .9 extended clip, as long as my dick
They say I'm grimy, yeah fuck it I'll line niggaz
I'll show 'em where your shit at before they take mine nigga (ha ha ha)
Don't take it personal, it's just how I grind nigga
Figure, this is a dog-eat-dog world, man
Ebony enemy, today I'm tryin to duck her
Got that Hoover, her head'll make you kill a motherfucker (don't stop girl)
I mean you gotta feel it man
She bob and weave, up and down, you be like "I could just kill a man"
I don't fuck with them niggaz from her projects
They on Section 8, but niggaz cars are straight
They ain't out in the daytime, them niggaz roaches
I don't stop down there if I ain't got the toaster
I'm in the 6-4-5 hard top, not the drop
Leanin, I see them niggaz schemin, dream on
Touch me, shit I wish a nigga would
I'm how my niggaz eat, I'll have 'em light up they whole hood

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
They said I fell off, my Benz was on the repo truck
Around the same time niggaz spots start gettin stuck
Shit, I said "I ain't know nuttin 'bout nuttin"
I'm on the low, niggaz really know me for stuntin
I pull through on low pros, wrapped around deep dishes
That crack money handsome, your bitch blowin me kisses
You need to check her if you think she could be the missus
Damn - I'm startin to think you can't trust nobody
I hold my own strap, they ain't got to hold that for me
I slide by my baby momma crib with the Mac on me
Man since her cousin in the car crash died
She said "Don't drink and drive," I say "Just drink, don't drive"
I had a morphine dream, I got heroin ambitions
That's big money cookin in that coffee pot in the kitchen
When I say I'm straight, I mean I'm straight
Once the razor hit the plate, I double up the cake, ayy

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
You's a purse snatchin ass nigga man
You's a PETTY nigga!
I could look at you I could TELL you's a petty nigga
You's a copy!
You's a itty-bitty nigga, I'm a big city nigga
New York City nigga, ha ha!
