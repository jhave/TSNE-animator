[Warren G]
Please don't get it confused
Cuz I rap that I'm like these other dudes
I doubt that VIP don't get to me
I'm where the crowd at
Still the same, hate the fame, loud and all that
Wylin' ain't a thang we can brawl in the back
Hit hard, sock jaw, fall on your back
No bodyguards imagine and all that
Hear from the streets like 'where my doggs at?'
Keep 'em with heat in case they involve gats
9-11 is for certain hurry call back
Don't paid to get dirt done, now what you call that?
So much love on the streets I can take a fall back
My credentials is based on all facts some things you can hate on
We all macks so if your broad get take on
It's like that overwhelmed like conversations she'll be right back

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
Ups and downs
All my life
I'm just trying to stay rich
All the time
(Life's so motherfucking hard on a nigga)

[Snoop Dogg]
Life's so hard for a young ass nigga trying to get his money in the rap game homie
All my life I dreamed of seeing this, leading this
Rap game, G'ing this, we in this doing this
Doing it for the whole wizord
All my homeboys, tiny loccs and the lil baby gizerds
Yes it's true that dreams can come true
If it happened to me, it can happen to you
Watch out, they shootin'
Look good for a nigga now
You know me, I gotta kick a hundred niggaz down
Even niggaz that I ain't supposed to
Let them dirty, gritty killas close too
I do it for the love of it
No nigga, I do it for the fuck of it
EC IC SP and Naj even though I'm living large
Man, life is still hard

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
No matter how hard the road
No matter how hard the cold
No matter far I gotta go
With my cash flow I'm gon' go
Cuz I'm coming down

[Snoop Dogg]
I started at the bottom so ain't nothing to do
but come up with the homies that I call my crew

[Warren G]
Stay true to the game, kept it the same
Despite the fame
Maintain through the downs we kept our heads up, remain

[Snoop Dogg]
We all in, it's all in, so fall in
We went from nothing to now
We straight rolling

[Warren G]
No matter how cold it gets
I'm on the road to get rich
Trust no ho, trust no bi-itch

[Chorus to end]</pre>
