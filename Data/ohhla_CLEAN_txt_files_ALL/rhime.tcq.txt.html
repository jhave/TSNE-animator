[Q] Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
    We used to kick routines and presence was fittin
    It was I, The Abstract
[P] And me the five footer
    I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
[Q] Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
    that we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
[P] Um um, a tidbit, um, a smidgen
    I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon
[Q] You on point Phife?
[P] All the time, Tip
[Q] You on point Phife?
[P] All the time, Tip
[Q] You on point Phife?
[P] All the time, Tip
[Q] Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip

[Phife Dawg]
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that body in El Segundo then +Push it Along+
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shot of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On job remaining, no I'm chaining cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word

[P] Back in days on the boulevard of Linden
    We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin
    It was I the Phifer
[Q] And me The Abstract
    The rhymes were so rumpin' that the brothers rode the 'zack
[P] Yo Tip you recall when we used to rock
    those fly routines on your cousin's block
[Q] Um, let me see, damn I can't remember
    I receive the message and you will play the sender
[P] You on point Tip?
[Q] All the time Phife
[P] You on point Tip?
[Q] Yeah, all the time Phife
[P] You on point Tip?
[Q] Yo, all the time Phife
[P] So play the resurrector and give the dead some life

[Q-Tip]
Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed.  I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must I go to gain respect? Um
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty,
record company people are shady
So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack,
I don't doubt it.  Look at how they act
Off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll storm with the crew and ..
Proper.  What you say Hammer?  Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop

In London, check the rhyme, y'all</pre>
