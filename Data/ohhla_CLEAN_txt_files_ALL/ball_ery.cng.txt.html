Chorus: Lucky Luciano
I ball everywhere I go (Where I go)
I got a Benz
I don't crawl on them '84's ('84)
The ladies love us
Cause our song on the radio (Radio)
We fin' to take 'em to the
Tele, make a video
A video, I said
I ball everywhere I go (Where I go)
I got a Benz
I don't crawl on them '84's ('84)
The ladies love us
Cause our song on the radio (Radio)
We fin' to take 'em to the
Tele, make a video
A video

(Verse 1)
[Chingo Bling]  Mercedes Benz
                Lot of bragger
                Done more shows than Mick Jagger
                Gots a Visa
                On a cracker
                Underground
                Track jacker
                Rock ostrich
                Rock gators
                Custom boots
                Now and later
                Black on black like Darth Vader
                Prada lens
                'Sache shader
                Hit the pen
                Hit the pencil
                Down around the buildin' when I do it in still
                Hey, little kid, no touch my Benzo
                Paris Hilton went in my limo
[Lucky Luciano] Ay, you don't know, she my baby boo
[Chingo Bling]  Down south, we bangin' Screw
                Ball fades and braids, too
                Where Dem Dollars At, like Gangsta Boo
                In Miami
                Havin' lunch
                Sign a deal with such and such
                Puff Daddy ain't have enough
                Chingo Bling gon' platinum plants
                Just like the teeth is
                In my mouth
                Thirty stacks
                On the couch
                Hundred grand
                Pulled it out
                Take the rubberband off, threw it in the crowd

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
[Chingo Bling]
Jeezy got 'em for seventeen
Ross got 'em for twenty-two
They both got 'em from you-know-who
They keep that off MTV News
Break bread
With a Mexican
Price low
I ain't taxin'
Think I had sex with Janet Jackson
Take a look at me
Who you askin'
Lose a magmun
I ain't trust 'em
Hidden camera
On manosa
Meet Demi Moore on 24
I took that whore from Ashton Cutcher

[Lucky Luciano]
And she pulled over when I tap my foot
Look at me, I have a hood
When I'm done, she'll ride the book
Call me young, man, not a crook
Don't I smell like a bag of money
Mama ain't raised no damn dummy
Smile fade with a fat tummy
Big ol' lobsters, that's from Lucky
Got more cheese than a quesadilla
Texas boy, your oil driller
Fuck swag, I Sas'parilla
Chingo boots, armadillo

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Lucky Luciano] Me and Chingo Bling, we down in Florida
                Got three models on a camcorder
                Vida Guerra, my bench warmer
                Got it in the backseat of that red Ferrari
[Chingo Bling]  Mayne!
[Lucky Luciano] Look at the wheels
                And now I know how a baby feels
                Seen Babyface when he got the deal
                Man, I got that whip appeal
                Candy Rain, I'm Soul IV Real
                Kurt Cobain, all the mobile
                I drive for change, blew out the brain
                It's drippin' red off the bumper grill
[Chingo Bling]  Already
                Yeah, that's trill
                Like you did that there, now put this here
                Bought Cleto a diamond grill
                Same day that I got my deal
                Brown party
                I ain't white
                Like Mike Jones, I'm a say it twice
                Got more hoes than Brian McKnight
                Got more hoes than Brian McKnight
                Next door neighbor, Chevy Chase
                Got these rocks from out of state
                Signed to you, no mama's, wey
                C.E.O., all I gotta say
