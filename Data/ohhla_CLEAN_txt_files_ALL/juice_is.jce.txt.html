*I havent even started my reign, I'm only drizzling*
*So whoever wanna battle, ya'll can bring it to the Juice*
*Big Juice in the house* *Damn right*
*I'll either shake your hand or shake your mic*
*I havent even started my reign, I'm only drizzling*
*So whoever wanna battle, ya'll can bring it to the Juice*
*Big Juice in the house* *Damn right*
*I'll either shake your hand or shake your mic*

[verse]
My freestyle's gotta be that of a child prodigy
I rack my brain just to spit another flow outta me
I leave rappers dead and their ladies cries watery
Right before he passed away, I know that rapper thought of me
I'm paid on the nighty, ya'll get paid on the quarterly
And into work for your record labels like an orderly(??)
And you underground rappers, ya'll could do a lil more then me
These Tiger Woods niggaz, ya'll aint even up to par with me
The way I drop kinetics, its close to aporetic
Cop an edit of the tape, if its Hip Hop, I said it
Stress don't concern me, I don't stop to let it
In my zone you see these rappers that can't rock behead it
I split them wide open, rush 'em and hit 'em high
I split 'em while he's hoping that rhyme'll get him by
Now he's leaking H2O, he couldnt escape the flow
Sitting nervous, waiting for his first tape to blow
For him success means try'na make the dough
He just imitates others, never creating a flow
But I'm simpley the best like I'm HBO
I represent the Illinois so thats what makes me so
I know how weed looks, but yo, I also read books
Might struggle with bad pop songs and mean hooks
You use to be creative, but now your gimmicky
Mimicy, instead of using chemistry mixed with beat imagery
Whether its him or me, we ripping it continuely
I been a G ever since Pops pertain my enemy
Now I just max, relax and drink Hennessy
When I'm drunk, I'm in the mirror try'na battle ten of me
I stay straight, I murder with the cordless or the tray 8
You try'na update that style but you a day late
Some play hate, they get murdered before the day breaks
I'm the landlord and every rapper gotta vacate
The Molemen, kings of the underground production
Lose?  Who got the gumption to make such a assumption
My tape is like crack, its made, then its pumped in
The ghettos of America for your main consumption
Dont play to battle me 'ro, or you'll get dumped in
The lake with them other fake cats that shoulda jumped in
I bang like Patrease(??) rushing on percussion
I take your self esteem and bring it down like destruction
