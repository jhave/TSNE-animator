[40 second instrumental to open]

[Pacewon]
Yo, until Miss Cleo predicts who pull the most chicks
Let me tell you in advance that's me
Sippin on Henny, never have to spend a pretty penny
20/20 vision can't see
Yo, I keep game tight go out and mack hard
I'm just another pimp slash rapper at large
Whippin through them uptown streets like Black Rob
Puffin on wet mixed in with backyard
I got it locked no doubt, I thank God
Keep a jimmy hat right by my bank card
I'm the P-A-C-E-O-N-E
Wanna be a deceased geek, no friends speak?
Wanna be a police chief?  Go get heat
See if they got a badge that they'll thrown in free
Now you can fight crime in the alleys of the badland
Wear a cape, be a hero like Batman

[Chorus: Jamaican patois sample 4X]
"Wake the town of jazzy people" - best guess

[Pacewon]
Raw to the core, seen y'all dime a dozen act on tour
I didn't applaud
You rap like a broad bein fucked in the back of a Ford
Maybe you should unfasten your bra
You gotta have breath control, and be flexible
If you wanna be the next to blow
You gotta spit flame, shit game, steal cars and flip 'caine
Make haste, stay safe until you hit fame
Make noise, break boys, then buy a big chain
To cover up the fact them rhymes you kick lame
Dumb in the flesh and, uninterestin
I'm Tonto, holdin up a gun in a Western
"We the sound of jazzy people" - like the silver bullet
You can't get a deal cause you might deliver bullshit
Might make a tape that's dull with no glamour
Besides these labels would rather sign Hammer

[Chorus] - 2X

[Pacewon]
Yo, until Miss Cleo predicts who pull the most chicks
Let me tell you in advance that's me
Sippin on Henny, never have to spend a pretty penny
20/20 vision can't see
Yo, come in with a clique, go out in a bang
Fed up with a chick, get down with a gang
Sick of talkin proper, bite my slang
Suck my left nut while my right ball hang
Don't like cars?  Cop you a van
Don't like jobs?  Start up a scam
Don't like bein by yourself?  Roll with a clan
Be a soldier, fuck your mother holdin your hand
Yo, you want lettuce, got a fetish, go and get it
Instead of spendin money blowin credit
For all our sakes, get a 9 to 5 and stop rappin
Somethin, fuck it, make your kids start actin

[Chorus] - 4X</pre>
