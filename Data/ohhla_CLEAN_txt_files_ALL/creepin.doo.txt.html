[Dr. Dooom]
Okay~! It's about 7:30
People gettin dressed to go out

I'm ready to use my Home Depot equipment to chop into your shipment
I'm the super of your building with the hand comin out the ceiling
The original Wolfman of rap with Lily Monster on my lap
Hittin you in the face with four rollers
Microwave up your Big Mac with a dead rat
You think you construction? I got tools that'll cut through your hard hat
Follow your blackout with a hard back
Run over your face with four black tires
Now you crushed up under a Mack
With special victim units snappin shots of your buttcrack
You sippin poison to this track
Bones sent down South to North Cakalak
Wit'cha face cut off in the trunk in the back of a Cadillac
Messin with the cousin of Leatherface, you shoulda known that
Skuller version now your hair won't grow back

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm creepin, cuttin up tonight
I'm creepin, at your party that's right

[Dr. Dooom]
You try not to be there in the area
when I come out the basement to present the bull's ass award
You see the spotted truck with dingy wheels
You keep walkin and movin forward
Imagine "Halloween," Michael Myers
Rakin the hammer and bangin the nails in your Bentley Coupe tires
Wrappin your face up with jumper cable wires
Tie you up in the backseat of the car and set your motor on fire
Nonchalant talkin to police officers, I'm calm standin right by ya
Lovin the siren sounds, volume higher
With custom work boots, puffin durable
to walk on top of the back of your neck, you know they work duke
When I get to chewin them bones they make you puke
Non-stop send 'em to big chop syndrome
Your fingers I hot dog vend 'em
With barbecue sauce you see that barbecue toss
Your legs soak in a pot for a full cost
Too much for a full horse
Three rhinoceros, Mr. Snuffleupagus
She weighses about as much as all of us

[Chorus]

[Dr. Dooom]
I'm workin double shift with my lamp and pumpkin
Lookin over there, don't you see somethin?
That's some forensic investigation research
The feds love to invade my turf
I'm eatin my peanut butter sandwiches with three different shirts
One pinstripe, one plaid
One that makes me wake up with scissors mad
Leave with your ears in the department store shopping bag
Put the roach spray in your stomach
Stash your pelvis in the back of the Jag
Now you packed up with pants in the back with the spare tire with the blue bag
Hangin in the plastic with a new tag

[Chorus]</pre>
