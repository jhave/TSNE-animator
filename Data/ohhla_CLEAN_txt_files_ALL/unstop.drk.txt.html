[Verse 1: Drake]
My name is Drizzy
And I ain't perfect
But I work hard
So I deserve it
And I belong
Right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't mister fenny
I got a descent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
And I fall in love with girls
Caught up in superficial glammer
Who dress like Sara Jessica
And live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions
And I'm the one that will feed it
But truly you bad enough
That you don't even really need it
You could show at the party
On dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snapping candids
Of you and your possie partying
Drinking what you get handed
With your virgin island tans
All looking like you just landed
I don't really understand it
I'm not sure I'm comprehending
But these girls are having fun with whoevers money they spending screaming

[Chorus - Santigold (2x)]
I Got To Be Unstoppable [2x]
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie [2x]

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Ehhhm, My name is Wezzy
I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard working
Bizarre circus
That's where my bar surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I laying on my back I'm never backing down
So over stand me
I got a condo in Miami
And my door mat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana
But I never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta
And I always wear a bandanna
And when it comes down to stunting
You boys are just buttoning
And I'm swinging for the fence
Your girl hanging from my dick
Your girl singing to my shit like
A loli-loli-lollipop
She say I get that pussy wetter than a dasani shop
And she say I pick that pussy better 
Better than her gynecologist
Hoe just text me whenever you want some more dick
More dick
Old bitch
Young bitch
But I be like damn
All I got is one dick

[Chorus - Santigold]
I Got To Be Unstoppable [2x]
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie [2x] 

[Santigold]
I got the talk
The beat and bass
Give me one I'll take it
Make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play
So I speed up the pace
I break it break it you can't stop me
In this ra-race

[Chorus - Santigold (2x)]
I Got To Be Unstoppable [2x]
Ay Ay Ay Ay You Don't Lie [2x] </pre>
