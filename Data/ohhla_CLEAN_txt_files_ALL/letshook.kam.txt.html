[Chorus]:(2x)
Do you wanna hook with me? cus I wanna hook up you
No matter what we do, I just wanna hook with you

[Kam]:
What's up, come here, what's your name? (Ivan)
Ay, let me leave you my hook up real quick you know the game
And if I give you my number you gon use it? (mmhmm)
Well we can dance to the music, here you go, don't lose it
Now, when you gon call me? (When yo want me to?)
Shit, hit me tonight (aight)
Straight up, I'm be up front witcha
Blunt like a philly (You so silly)
Oh, really? well check this out, I aint no big willie nigga, you feel me?
I'm just a G, so my code's gon be double three six
You shake them rats, I'll scratch off those fleas and ticks
And we can kick it at my spot, just you and me
Show me what you got, let me see, turn around for me, ooh wee
You need to call me but if not you still sweet hun
You even got your little feet done
Head to toe, you good to go
So baby we could take it fast or slow
But all I really wanna know is when we hookin up

[Chorus]:(2x)
Do you wanna hook with me? cus I wanna hook up you
No matter what we do, I just wanna hook with you

[Kam]:
I thought you was tied down but your not, go figure
C'mon now, you can't tell that you got no nigga
You say your last boyfriend gave you too much abuse
Kept on putting you down, so you had to cut him loose
It's been a while since you had some, like nine months
And all that time you telling me that you ain't did it once?
And now the telephone conversation getting steamy
So let's cut to the chase, when you gon come and see me?
What you doin tonight? (Nuttin) You should fall through
(You know I got my homegirl wit me) I don't care, she can come too
I'm just trying to see you though, you know what I mean?
I guess the question now is, are you tryin to get seen?
What's the plan queen? I can't be comin at you soft
But stop bullshittin, tell your girl to drop you off
And if that's cool with you, and you aint got no objections
Grab a pen and some paper and take down these directions

[Chorus]:(2x)
Do you wanna hook with me? cus I wanna hook up you
No matter what we do, I just wanna hook with you

[Kam]:
First time you ever saw me, I was thugged up
I didn't think you was gon call and look, now we all hushed up
Kickin it tuff, can't seem to get enough affection
I like it ruff, but always use protection
Can't play around no mo, I'm spoken fo, and committed
And you know, you can't let no other niggas hit it
You can get it here whenever you need it, night or day
So don't be too shy to say, Come over right away
But I Ain't gotta be stickin it, and you ain't gotta be jumpin me
We can be just kickin it, enjoying each others company
Something we can do that don't cost no money
Or we can floss, but remember I'm the boss though honey
I treat you good if you act right, I'll be your black knight
In shinnin armor, while your girlfriends back fight
I want this relationship to continue
You so tight you make a nigga wanna put a baby in you

[Chorus]:(4x)
Do you wanna hook with me? cus I wanna hook up you
No matter what we do, I just wanna hook with you</pre>
