[Chingo Bling]
We in your door, culero
And my nuts gon' hang
Southside

Chorus: Carnival Beats
"Be all in your door cause it's a southside thang
I'm rollin' down in my Lincoln
My nuts gon' hang, I be all
Be all in your door cause it's a southside thang
I'm rollin' down in my Lincoln
My nuts gon' hang, I be all" --&gt; Fat Pat

(Verse 1)
Southeast in Grandeau
Where them boys don't run
I done swang, I done swung, H-town's where I'm from
Pack big chrome dummy
Got King Kong money
That bobblehead mixtape, ringtone money
Grandeau to Pasadena, Grease Point
To Cavalcay
Yeah, these Mexicans gettin' paid, comin' down in Escalade, we ball
Spades of braids
Still repin' Monterey
Valle Hermoso, Taumaulipas, that's where all my peoples stay (Mexico)
When I hit the script
I see some chicks that I used to hit
Samantha
Tattoo of a panther, I smashed her
Top-drop dancer, fine hoe romancer
She ain't talkin' about no money, then
I can't answer
Hey Nas
Hey Nas
We heard what you said
You just mad cause we hoggin' all the bread, this shit ain't dead
Down here, these boys wreckin' microphones, we abuse it
These ain't
Hip hop records, this is Country Wreck
Music
You losin'

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 2)
Take the mind of Russell Simmons, controversy of E!
Mix it up with Master P, now you purchasin' me
Who that is, Chingo Blingo, oooh, that the boy out the south
Got the red, white and green bling-bling in his mouth
Like Slim, he do gloss on everything that he floss
And I know the FEDS love to take
Pics of his house
Pudgy putos can't
Get him, cause
Chingo ain't
In 'em, I
22-inch' spin 'em, choppin' boards like a blender
I'm a throw
Hoe-getter, super dope flow spitter
Throw a MySpace party at Toyota Center
This for
All my Mexicans in the pen, gettin' swole
If they gave y'all parole, I go
Twenty times gold
Cause the Southside holdin'
Northside holdin'
They Can't Deport Us All
That's the motherfuckin' slogan
I'm a rep it real hard
And put it on the Billboard
Green paper, brown face is what I'm in it for

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
I'm in this Lone Star State of Texas, what it do
Representin' 713 all that way to that 512
210
214
409, I'm tippin' down
Wavin' hood, all through the hood, I'm grippin' wood and blowin' pine
H-Town, the funky town, (???) home, the stop six
5-9 down to the valley, that's screwtape, all in the mix
Stayin' licks and tintin' fours, I'm flippin' vogues, I'm sittin swole'
Sittin' Sidewayz on that butter
Heated up
I'm on a roll
Come in down my slab, hoe
Screens on and neons lit
Grillin' women and frolicin'
I'm must admit, that I'm the shit
Cadillac is what I flip
Texas tea is what I sip
(???) is what I tip
Expensive Taste all on my lip
Breakin' 'em off, I'm ridin' dirty, I'm chunkin' deuce with the Lil' Keke
Paul Wall and Chingo Bling, slammin' trunks like Jailgreen
Swisha House, yeah, that's my team
Jolly dang, it's why I bling
Throwed in the game, if you know what I mean
I start to ching, this reign supreme
