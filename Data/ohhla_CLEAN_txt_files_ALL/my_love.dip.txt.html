[Intro: Juelz Santana]
For lovin me girl
Just wanna thank you
Look at what you can do man
Free I like this shit right here man
Girl c'mon
Let's do it like this
Santana's so focused on you
Come holla at a boy that's focused on you

[Juelz Santana]
Shorty I ain't tryin to give you the run around
I'm just tryin to come get you a run around
Skip through a couple towns
Maybe skip through a couple rounds
If your man act dumb I'ma shut him down
I'm sorta a long distance brother
Long checks,long chips, long dick and rubber
Come roll with a pimp or gangsta
Hustler by nature
Trust that I'll take ya
I'll show you the rules and perimeters
Show you how to move with the ooze how to handle it
Show you how to cut loose soon as we scramble it
On the block as soon as the moon it be scramblin'
And you can be my down ass bitch
Yeah baby that's for sure
I'm a show you how package raw
How to snap it on
How to take trips with the package on
How to go and come back with the package gone
Just stacks of cash beyond

[Chorus: Juelz + Freeway]
And ya'll nigaz betta cuff ya girls
Cuz Santana and Free is runnin up the girls (Yeah)
No game just fuck your girls
But who am I to corrupt the world? (Yeah)

Give her pounds, give her pies, giver her cake (Yeah)
Hit a city, hit a town, hit a state (Yeah)
Every ghetto every hood we there
Every metal in a Roc-A-Wear

[Freeway]
I been there every ghetto all around the world
I've put that rock shit around ya girl and take down nigga
I take pounds nigga, matter fact I take pounds to chicks
Give 'em train tickets across the border
Is you going or what? Can you go bring back my packages that you joined to her
Get in positions with my sqaud
That's like ironic, you wit me then the venential driver
I'll have you drive me to E-way and stuff, stuff in out tronics
I need a woman to bake, cook pies in the winter then diet, give her the weight
She'll have pounds in the summer, I like Roc-A-Wear Miss Wear
Thick hair, Chick there, Fat Ass, Sick Pair
When we travel to Orlando when we get there, Shit yeah
Bialingal always slang, Across the border diamond yang
Put in orders, Even though we just came to hang
Then we take it where we left there heck yea
I need more then a woman cause it's more then you think here
Bank here, Who rank down here? And I'm more then a rapper
Cause it's more then these rhymes here, Poss here
Hold Nas down here Holla

[Chorus]</pre>
