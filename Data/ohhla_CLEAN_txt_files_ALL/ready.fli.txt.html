[Intro]
You been patiently waiting
Yeah, I see you
Yeah, you see me
Loving your body
You sexin' all on me
Annie girl you know your role

[Verse 1]
Let you watch me while I stroke it
Sure enough, I'm the reason why you feel that way
Inside, you don't stop me Annie
Because you know I make you feel right
Make you feel right
I'm a make your pussy mine
Annie back it up on me
Cause you already know
Your sex is what I'm wantin'
I'd rather keep you moaning
You're biting and scratching and kissing on me
Everything your doin' let's me know

[Chorus]
You're ready
You're ready
Annie girl, Annie girl
Everything you doing let's me know that you are ready

[Verse 2]
Dim the lights, dim the lights
We gonna get it right, get it right
Sexin' your, your body
Cause' your sex appeal
Do you watch me while I stroke it?
Oh yeah, I do it how you want it
Cause you know I make you feel right
Make you feel right
I'll make your pussy mine

[Bridge]
