[Lauryn Hill] Yo!
[Wyclef Jean] One time!
 
[Lauryn Hill] 
I was born by the river (uhh) (uhh)
In a tenement, and oooohhh.. my poor mother
She could hardly pay the rent
It's been a long (ha) a long time coming
But I know oohh.. a change is going to come
Awww yes, it will
 
[Wyclef Jean] Two time!
 
[Lauryn Hill]
Yeah, it's been too hard living (huh)
And I'm afraid to die (Why?)
I don't know what's out there, yeaah, yeaaah.. beyond the sky
It's been a long (huh) a long time coming
But I know oohh.. a change is gonna come (Awww)
Awwww yes, it will
Say it Wyclef, Say it
 
[Wyclef Jean] Check it out, uh uh, Awww Ma
 
[Lauryn Hill]
Yo, See I go oohh.. to my brother

And I say brother, help me please (come on, L Boogie!)
And he winds up, he winds up, knocking me, knocking me (uh huh)
Yeah, huh.. back down on my knees Ohhh!
 
[Wyclef Jean] Three time!
 
[Lauryn Hill]
It's been times when I didn't think
That I would last for long (huh)
But now we think they're bound... to carry on
It's been a long (uh huh huh huh yeah) a long time coming
But I know oohh.. a change is gonna come
Awww yes, it will
Awww yes, Oohhh
