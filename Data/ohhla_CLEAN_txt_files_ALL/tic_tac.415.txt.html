[ D-Loc ]
Rich, what's up with these bitches coppin these attitudes, man?
[ Richie Rich ]
Man, I don't know, I had one of these stupid hoes the other night, man
[ D-Loc ]
Shoulda slapped that bitch
[ Richie Rich ]
Talkin shit
I'ma talkin about real shit
Cause I got up out the cock and went to handle some business
[ D-Loc ]
That's what you 'posed to do
[ Richie Rich ]
Well, I didn't really handle no business though
I went and fucked with another bitch
[ D-Loc ]
Fuck that bitch, you ain't got to be suckin up to no stupid-ass hoe
[ Richie Rich ]
The hoe breath was stankin and everything
I offered the hoe a Tic Tac
Matter of fact, the hoe name was Nic Nac...

[ Richie Rich ]
You're just mad cause I left the room
And since I didn't come back you're actin a fool
Bitch, I had a knot, so I rushed up out the cock
What you thought was a knock was a hoe on jock
So I skipped and you don't know why
Silly muthafucka, the cock was dry
I kept pumpin and poundin, and all I saw
Was 10 more minutes of this and my dick would be straight raw
Nic Nac, your breath needs a Tic Tac
Fuckin with the Dubble-R you needs to kick back
I made the "415" and "Sniches &amp; Biches"
And I be damned if a hoe will milk me for riches
Just straight up dick is your option to lick
Fuck ridin on the gold ones and material shit
It's like this, baby girl, you better survive
And quit talkin shit about the 415
So take that, Miss Nic Nac
You ain't held 415 back</pre>
