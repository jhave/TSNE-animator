[Rah Digga]
Yeah, Rah Digga
First lady of the Flipmode Squad

Some more Rocky Balboa ish going down right here
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, hey ladies
I wanna take this time to talk to all my sisters out there
All my independent, hard working sisters
Who don't need nothing from no man, yeah
Got they own business goin' down you know what I'm sayin', that's right
But there's always that one brother out there, uh huh
That just turn you out
You know what I'm sayin', hah
Come on, come on, come on
Yeah, we gon' talk about him right now, come on

[Jamelia]
I've never seen somebody do to me what you do
Never been close to the edge, nearly lose my cool
I'm usually miss independent but I'm hung up on you
I think you're all that, how you feel about all that
I'm kinda thinking that you feel it too, and

[Jamelia] (Rah Digga)
I know (uh huh), you know
We know where this should go, and
I know (uh huh), you know
You'd be a fool if you tell me no, and
I can't let you pass me by
Just fly out of my life with no goodbyes
(Huh, huh, huh, you bout it, I'm bout it, come on)

[Jamelia]
The B, the O, the U, the T
It is what you are baby
The H, the O, the N, The E, Y are you so fine
The B, the O, the O, the M
I feel I need to get with him
See you so fine, I want your time
Tell me what you wanna do

[Jamelia]
I need to know what's up with you
Do you got a girl and is she true
I'm feeling that you dont because, well, just because
You got my hand in yours right now
Feel my walls breaking down
I got my own flat, how you feel about that
Feel I should introduce the two of you, and

[Jamelia] (Rah Digga)
I know (uh huh), you know
We know where this should go, and
I know (uh huh), you know
You'd be a fool if you tell me no, and
I can't let you pass me by
Just fly out of my life with no goodbyes
(Huh, huh, you bout it, I'm bout it, come on)

[Jamelia]
The B, the O, the U, the T
It is what you are baby
The H, the O, the N, The E, Y are you so fine
The B, the O, the O, the M
I feel I need to get with him
See you so fine, I want your time
Tell me what you wanna do
Oh my God, look at him

[Rah Digga] (Jamelia)
Huh, huh, huh, huh, you bout it, I'm bout it, come on
Look at honey over there with the savoir faire
Got the girlies all pimpin' but he really don't care
Postin' in the whip, shorty boom a trip
If he bout like I'm bout we can take a little dip
That's me and you right, if you feelin' my vibes
Got sister girl open, ain't no need to lie
Any type way how me jockin' your style
You know you got it goin' on but I peeped your file
(I know) uh huh, (you know)
I ain't tryin' to be a sucker for love for nobody
(I know) uh huh, (you know)
Can't wait for the day to play with your body
I know you're nothing but trouble
And I might get hurt if my feelings start to bubble
But I'll just have to work it out
Peep everything else right now, you the bout boy

[Jamelia]
The B, the O, the U, the T
It is what you are baby
The H, the O, the N, The E, Y are you so fine
The B, the O, the O, the M
I feel I need to get with him
See you so fine, I want your time
Tell me what you wanna do

[Jamelia]
The B, the O, the U, the T
It is what you are baby
The H, the O, the N, The E, Oh, 'Y' are you so fine
The B, the O, the O, the M

See you so fine, I want your time
Tell me what you wanna do
