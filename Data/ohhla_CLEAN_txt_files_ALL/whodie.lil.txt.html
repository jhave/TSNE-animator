Lil B

I'm a tell you like this, bitch, wassam, whodie
I'm a fuck that ho in the ass, whodie (Based God)
And I'm still yellin' muthafuck the task, whodie
And I still got that hard in the bag, whodie
We be goin' too dumb in the functions, whodie
Nigga got a pistol, I don't give a fuck, whodie
I know you fucked her hard, yeah, that's what's up, whodie
Are you finna die? Yeah, that's what's up, whodie (Based God)
Wanna wear a black mask like a ho, whodie
I'm a street nigga like Project Pat, whodie
But I'm a little worse, bitch, bet that, whodie
I hold that black mac, that's what's up, whodie
Lil B rep the world, that's wassam, whodie
I'm the number one bitch, that's wassam, whodie

[Chorus: x2]
All my real niggas holla, whodie whodie
All my freak bitches holla, whodie whodie

[Verse 2]
Lil B actually don't give a fuck, whodie
Yeah, he be thuggin' hard bitch, yeah, that's wassam, whodie
I was that nigga off the porch with a dream, whodie
And I still go hard to get that green, whodie
And these niggas don't wanna let me be, whodie
And I ain't even really on TV, whodie
But I'm a keep it real, rest in peace, whodie
I'm a keep it real man, the streets want me
I'm a keep it real, Lil B, that nigga hungry
And I sleep with the mac like a ho, it's nothin'
Word around town that Lil B be buzzin'
Streets love me, ya feel me? Uh
Yeah, the streets love me
One time for the motherfuckin' New Orleans
Shouts out to all the wars, let's get it!
