[Chorus - 2X]
All I wanna do is smoke my dro..bitch
Sit on the couch get high n get throwed bitch
Or in the car windows cracked gettin loaded
I'm representin everybody out there smokin

[Lil Wyte]
Roll it up, fire it up, chief it up
I'm ready to get fucked up
Soon as I get control of the dro I'm ready to feel the stuff
Light green marijuana been tellin me how it wanna
Go get up wit a swisher split the middle and bone a
I feel that I should get atleast one commercial from King Edward
I been smokin these blunts so long and look where my futures headed
I feel that dro work like Wheeties to rappers that are intelligent
Smoke you one and hit the mic the rest of the shit is irelevent
A lot of shit has happened since the last time you've heard my album
And I ain't talkin about no acid, oxycotton or valiums
I'm talkin about myself all the shit I've seen and the green I smoke
I'll be goin back to California but for now I Qoute...

[Chorus - 2X]
All I wanna do is smoke my dro..bitch
Sit on the couch get high n get throwed bitch
Or in the car windows cracked gettin loaded
I'm representin everybody out there smokin

[Dirt Bag]
Smoke like a Jamaican
Wildly reefer I'm cravin
I know I should be savin
But I'm blazin I'm blazin
Feelin like I'm amazin
Mary keepin me phazin
Sometimes I mix wit girly girly just for the tastin
Used to scoopin a half a onion and you be spacin
Miami Boy with that Dade County lacin
Dirt Bag and Lil Wyte you damn right
Hypnotize minds ??? we keep it hype
Buckle up and kiss flight I could take you to the start
Where is the bud..... its in the car
Ohhh my god different flavors and colors
And I'm smokin them all by the blunt motherfucker

[Chorus]</pre>
