[Chorus]
When you see somebody stumbling when they walk by
Tell 'em "hey kid, walk straight, master your high" -&gt; Slick Rick
Droolin from the mouth with them bloodshot eyes
Tell 'em "hey kid, walk straight, master your high"
You took a half of shrooms and now you bout to cry?
"Hey kid, walk straight, master your high"
Can't remember a thing no matter how hard you try
"Hey kid, walk straight, master your high"

First you start mumbling
Then you start stumbling
Then your motor skills start malfunctioning
Could it be the intake
Of the chemical that makes your body shake
All over, so critical
First one running to the bar
To get a drink
First one hanging out the car
Chunky pink
Really paralyzed, numb up and sedated
Moving with that rubber band body when you faded
Smoke about an ounce of weed
Drank ten beers, it's just a
Matter of time before you start getting the fears
You can't steer? (you can't steer?)
You can't hear? (you can't hear?)
You ain't here, you can't steer clear?
You wanna go home?

[Chorus]
When you see somebody stumbling when they walk by
Tell 'em "hey kid, walk straight, master your high" (-&gt;Slick Rick, 'Hey
Young World' (I think))
Droolin from the mouth with them bloodshot eyes
Tell 'em "hey kid, walk straight, master your high"
You took a half of shrooms, you think you gon die?
"Hey kid, walk straight, master your high"
Can't remember a thing no matter how hard you try
"Master your high"

First you smoke indo
Then some chocolate
But the gin and juice got you skyrocketing
Yo, can I get a Long Island?
Who got the bud?
Now you wanna lay it down
In the club
You supposed to be a thug drinking thug passion
But you can barely push it to the house
Without crashing
Now, you know better
Than getting that saucy
Trying to mix tequila
With kamekaze and bossy (?)
Fudge brownies
With ganja butter
Then you wanna hit the bone?
Your eyes flutter
Yo, she had a happy face
On her ecstacy
She started touching her private place
While she standing next to me
You shoulda had one drink
Like your girl
Now you in the bathroom
Calling Earl
Oh, now you got the spins,
The head-twirls
Underestimate your high
It rocked your world

[Chorus]
When you see somebody stumbling when they walk by
Tell 'em "hey kid, walk straight, master your high" (-&gt;Slick Rick, 'Hey
Young World' (I think))
Droolin from the mouth with them bloodshot eyes
Tell 'em "hey kid, walk straight, master your high"
You took a half of shrooms and now you bout to cry?
"Hey kid, walk straight, master your high"
Can't remember a thing on the acid fry
"Master your high"

First you need oxygen
For circulation
Then you need agua
Rejuvination
Maybe you should eat something
But nothing spicy
Maybe try a cold thai
Nice and icy
Now you can't leave here
You can barely open doors
Maybe take a shower
Open your pores
Just try to shake it off
Have some activity
Get your shit together
Then come back to the festivities
I'm not saying don't get high
Cuz that's on you
I'm just saying if you don't get high
Then what to do?
See, my friend right here
Can hold his liquor
But my friend right here
Is getting sicker
So, he started beef with my homie over what?
Took this fool to the house
To sober up
Maybe you should listen up,
Heed the warning
Or you gonna wake up sick as fuck
In the morning

God DAMN!</pre>
