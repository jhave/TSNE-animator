[RZA]
Wigs splat, get jacked, Zig-Zag
Bob Dig' back, migs act fool
Wiz jack jewel, kids act cool, in school
When they hit up walkman they catch the jewel
9th Prince, projects surrounded by a picket fence
Yo it must be the work of the wicked gent
Should we yack 'em? Should we attack 'em?
Should we gunsmack 'em or carjack 'em?
Slap 'em, computer hack 'em
Bypasses the school, I failed 5 classes
Had my eyes on the fat thighs and fat asses
Big tits, I used to rock the Gucci knits
And thick Polo sweaters with the horsey on the stitch
Now I rock the W-U W-E-A-R, boy be a star
No matter who you are, A-B Allah, B-C Allah
I was born in the wilderness with the urge of fullfillin' this
Rotten hip-hop that you crabs forgot
Wu what? Wu tucks, Wu cuts, Wu new chucks
You could suck dew nuts

[Chorus: RZA (both)]
Some of y'all niggaz hold mic like bitches
Some of y'all bitches hold mics like niggaz
Hard for seeds to figure which is which is
Now you wonder why your seed switches
Burn the Bridges!
(See some of y'all niggaz hold mic like bitches
Some of y'all bitches hold mics like niggaz)
Hard for seeds to figure which is which is
Make you wonder why your seed switches
Burn the Bridges!

[9th Prince]
Aiyo I spit lead, the aim strike for ya head
9th Prince, sometimes I'm braindead
Six foot four, kick down ya front door
Breakin' all laws, verbal prostitute
Ya life is my whore, me and The RZA is like Twin Towers
Smack you with the culture power, sweet and sour
Rain acid showers, so grab ya umbrella
Poetry spoken accapella, the bad fellas
You can't feel us or smell us, or even rebel against us
So run for ya life par, fuck bein' a superstar
Give life like Allah U Akbar
Stay in ya lane with ya Go Kart, we too smart
Hollow point darts that'll stop ya heart
Beware of the dark, we teeth like tiger sharks
Or Noah's Ark, head shock reveals the worst part

[Chorus]</pre>
