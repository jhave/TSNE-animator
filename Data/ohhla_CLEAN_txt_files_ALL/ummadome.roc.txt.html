Song:   Umma Do Me
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

I'ma do me! I'ma do me! I'ma do me!
You just do you - I'ma do me! I'ma do me! I'ma do me!

[Rocko]
You wear Reebok, I wear Bally
You smoke Michy, I smoke Cali
You wear Enyce, but I wear Louis
I dropped six hunnid boys on these Guccis
You really like her, you might wife her
I don't like her, so I one-night her
You make is sprinkle, I make it tsunami
You get chump change, but I get money
You like dancin, I just two-step
You like to trick off, but I don't do that
You don't tote guns, I keep that tooly
Wanna see how it's done? Watch me do me!

[Chorus]
You just do you (and what?) I'ma do me! (ayy)
I'ma do me! (ayy) I'ma do me! (yeah)
You just do you (and what?) I'ma do me! (okay)
I'ma do me! (okay) I'ma do me! (ayy)
Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me (ayy)
Watch me do me (ayy) watch me do me (ayy)
Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me (yeah)
Watch me do me (yeah) watch me do me (ayy, ayy)

[Rocko]
What's that them Dolces? These here Chrome Heart
You need a key for yours? Me, my whip auto-start
Man I talk to the car and the car talk back
Then I step up out the car, watch the car back back (ayy)
Your money funny {*laughing*} my money talk
While we talking money, look, this how money walk
Player why you limpin? It could be two things (like what?)
Them fifteens or whole stacks in my blue jeans
That's last years model (me) I'm in that new thing
Black flips, black sack, call 'em shoestrings (ay who you with?)
Rocko roll, best thing since the TV
Pay attention let me show you how to do me

[Chorus]

[Rocko]
You like the fo' door (me) I just do two (okay)
If you ain't gettin money, nigga I'm nothin like you
I'm from the old school, you from the new school
My old school cost more than your new school
Just got a new school, that's what I'm used to
Suede around the panoramic equals clear view
You in my rearview - yeah you history (skrrt!)
First to second two seconds I love a six speed
I swag it out uhh, felt my swag
The shoes match the hat, the hat match my bag
These niggaz mad, you don't like it nigga sue me
Wanna see how it's done, then watch me do me

[Chorus]</pre>
