[Intro: Redman]
Ay, aiyyo Meth
It's time we came in the motherfuckin club nigga
They gotta know we in the buildin nigga, yeah!
Y'all motherfuckers got like (damn)
Two minutes to get to the motherfuckin bar nigga
(Y'all already know the business nigga)
Ha ha

[Redman]
Yo, I walk in pimpin when I'm up in here
Pulled up the G ride then I'm up in here
I ain't worried, I got mad muh'uckers here
And my advice stay at +Bay+ like a +Buccaneer+
I feel good when I walk inside
All eyes on the bro that's NBA live
The A.I. of rap, these haters gon' try
to shut me down but I, fly, high
A hood fella always gotta keep somethin close
A gutter flow like mine, gotta let 'em know
I'm +Xxplosive+ like Dre +Next Episode+
Check my file baby, this is the mother-load
Take off your heels (yeah) and shake your hair (yeah)
A nigga like me weavin through e'rywhere (yeah)
I taste like new money, make it clear
Baby, tell your friends that we right HERE!

[Chorus: Redman] + (Poo Bear)
I know what some'in is  you don't know what nuttin is {*3X*}
I know what some'in is  you don't know what nuttin IS~!
(You don't wanna see me shine)
(Talkin shit, on the low)
(Hate to see me in the sky)
(Flyin high, high, high)

[Method Man]
Yeah yo, yo
Who them dudes smellin like trees when we up in here?
Straight Gilla and Killa Beez when we up in here
Kush nigga, I keep the weed in the Tupperware
Fuck security, V.I.P., we can puff in here
Niggaz know how we do it (yeah) I ain't buyin the bar (yeah)
I'm tryin to talk her out her drawers, she tryin to charge
I ain't tryin to ball
Don't spend no money in the club, if I said that I was I'd be lyin to y'all
I gotta have it, an addict too and I'm puffin
You'd rather hate us, discuss it, no more discussions
The head of the house is now speakin, the food is ready for eatin
Your head is ready for beatin, I'll kick your teeth in
Don't fuck with Tical - you know a nigga black out off a couple beers
Smoke up an ounce, pass out like a couple years
And mami doin her thing, she in her underwear
You join the team and now win, I'll put you under there

[Chorus]

[Redman]
Yeah, yo
You know you smell mad weed when we up in here
A +Wildboy+ like Steve when we up in here (hey!)
And haters, they smell cheese when we up in here
But when we up in here, y'all know nothin here!

[Method Man]
And you know how we get it in when we up in here
Women smellin like cinnamon when she up in here
And haters, they pay the fee to get up in here
Meth and Doc, man these MC's don't want nothin here

[Chorus]</pre>
