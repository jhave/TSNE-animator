[TiLO]
Theory of relativity times spirtituality and drift
back in my memory
Searching for something sig-a-nificant deep
With enemy I want totrauet the world
And the 7 seas adventure to the desert
With some water and plant a seed kick
Down some of my energy and now I 
Can see things that before I could
Never see a new dimension filled
With knowledge and harmony one
Brotha 2 anotha kick back and play
A drum

[Tommy Lee]
Realize what lies deep within 
Your mind between you and me
Lock inside and youll see 
Realize what lies deep within
Your mind between you and me
Let the blind lead the blind
Who the hell cares where the fuck you come from
Who the hell cares where the fuck you come from
Who the hell cares where the fuck you come from
Who the hell cares where the fuck you come from

[Snoop Dogg]
Make your moves get your
Dibs nigga fuck them kids talkin'
Shit about you dog, they don't
How it is on the up yo you know
What? Mutha fuck yo cause I'm the 
Top Dog Big Dog  Big Ball on the block
Gettin money fuckin' ho's and rockin' hiphop
Methods of Mayhem with D-O-duble-G-Y
And we ride, slidin to a whole different deal on the
street 
Bang-bang chitty chitty 
I'm a crazy nigga from the md as Long Beach City!
I'm not your neighbor
I'm a gangsta with the flava and ill behavior

[Tommy Lee]
Realize what lies deep within 
Your mind between you and me
Lock inside and you'll see 
Realize what lies deep within
Your mind between you and me
Let the blind lead the blind
Who the hell cares where the fuck you come from
Who the hell cares where the fuck you come from
Who the hell cares where the fuck you come from
Who the hell cares where the fuck you come from
