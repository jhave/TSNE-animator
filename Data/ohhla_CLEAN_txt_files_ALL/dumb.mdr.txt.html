Real big up in this bitch
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, Gorilla Milk In It
and I'm talking to you niggas who's happy
as a fagot in a tree full of dicks
its one love, to nobody what's really going on
one love to nobody, Stupid Doo Doo Dumb
We at the party, Egghhh lets kill em off
tray em off make a bitch cough

[Mac Dre]
It started on a bright mourning in 1997
I was in my ss-cevy y'all, I-80 doing one eleven
barking on my faulty phone, fresh new fit Marease Malone
burning tongue feeling hella numb, stupid doo doo dumb off 151
honking at every hoe that pass me, I'm hella nasty boy I need chasy
I'm the type of brotha that will fuck yo motha
with a magnum rubba and leave it on the cova, and wont love her
all naw, all a nigga want is long jaw
eagle down where I'm from, how we come
Stupid doo doo dumb

Mac Mall (chorus 1)

When yo chasie getting nasty playing with her pearl tongue
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, Stupid Doo Doo Dumb
Four fingers in a pussy cutie gone use yo thumb
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, Stupid Doo Doo Dumb
When you hit it from the back and you smell sometin' sometin'
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, Stupid Doo Doo Dumb
Or when she's slurping on my dick and she starts to hum
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, Stupid Doo Doo Dumb

[Mac Dre]
This is a brief description for those who don't know Dre
I'll go bad on bitches like that nigga OJ
dig down broads and get blew at the telly
and don't see nothing wrong, like that fool R Kelly
I serve cock like Julie aint sell jocks
ass hole naked getting blew in my socks
I'm the type of nigga that do thangs to big thangs
a super freak like that man Rick James
Edina Howard cant freak like me
cuz when I was in the pin I used to beat my meat
But now I'm on the streets hitting hella skins
fuck a bitch so good she got to tell her friends
tarring shit up making noise and with 3romp and hood rat posing
From city to city, town to town Stupid Doo Doo Dumb is how we get down
Mac Mall (chorus two)
When you in yo own hood and they ask you where you from
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, Stupid Doo Doo Dumb
dick longer then my feddi off 151
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, Stupid Doo Doo Dumb
another hit of this shit and you gone bust yo lungs
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, Stupid Doo Doo Dumb
When the babi hella flabby cant make a playa cum
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, Stupid Doo Doo Dumb

[Mac Dre]
I'm hotter then fish grease, slicker than thick grease
a chump on the strap when serving the six-peace
slick with this shit like spit on a gold tooth
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb when I finish the cold both
crest sida, hoo rida, servin on suckas who try to
front with fake raps, man I break backs
and I make snaps when I shake craps
straight caps and lots of bay game cuz
its a bay thang with young Mac Dre, I say thangs
that make yo brain trip, frame from lame shit that some cant hang with
that game I play and slang on dope tracks
i lace the lame and tame with hoe slaps
I'm so fat, when I'm on the micro-phone
stupid dumb making' em leave the micro-phone

Mac Mall (chorus 3)

when you off dog food and yo nose start to run
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, Stupid Doo Doo Dumb
fuck a sista so good that her mami got sprung
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, Stupid Doo Doo Dumb
had her when I met her no teeth no tongue
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, Stupid Doo Doo Dumb
Crest Sidas in the house punk bitch we on one
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, Stupid Doo Doo Dumb
