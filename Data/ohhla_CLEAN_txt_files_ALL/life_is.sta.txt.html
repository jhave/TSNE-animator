[Chorus - Consequence] (Sample)
(Your life is short)
That's why I get my drink on
(Your life is short)
And I get my smoke on
(Your life is short)
Well do you need me to go on and on and on?
(So I waited, ew love)

(Life is short)
Yeah, I get my drink on
(Your life is short)
And I get my smoke on
(Your life is short)
But that could be where I go wrong
(To see me through)

[Verse 1 - Consequence]
'Cause I can't keep doin this, doin this, doin this
I'm too through with this, through with this, through with this
There's nothin left to do with this, I'm done with the stupid shit
'Cause everyday I'm wakin up just like a little kid
Feelin like, I was only supposed to smoke a little clip or
I was only supposed to drink a little bit more
Excuses to pour, the conclusion I draw
If I don't clean up my act like ? (to see me through)
Then I'm a find out somethin that I didn't know before
That +Life Is Too Short+ like my name was Todd Shaw
Hahahaha, check out the bizarre
It get's more bizarre as I get inside the car
And I open up my eyes and start to realize
That I'm in no condition to drive (drive)
And so I feel like Nick Hogan (to see me through)
As the walls start to close in

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Consequence]
'Cause I can't keep doin this, doin this, doin this
I'm too through with this, through with this, through with this
There's nothin left to do with it, it feels like I'm losin it
That's why I keep askin myself, "what you doin kid?"
'Cause back when Red and Meth had a month for the man
I was takin steps toward becomin a man
But you wouldn't catch me without a blunt inside my hand
And a lot of my friends just couldn't understand (to see me through)
'Cause when they see me lightin up them C-I-garettes
They would tighten up and would be embarrassed
And would plea with me, "please, won't you kick that habit?
Before your +Dead and Gone+ like T.I. Harris
But some of us have addictive personalities
I'm addicted to flippin verses with analogies
That sound sicker in your system than an allergy
So maybe I'll need this to bring the best out of me (to see me through)

[Chorus]

'Cause I can't keep doin this, doin this, doin this
(Statik Selektah) ...
(To wipe away my sadness)
'Cause I can't keep doin this ...</pre>
