[Missy]
Read between the lines
Ecstacy, a place of fullfillment and fantasies
Were your dreams become reality's
Mhm, ecstacy
It enhances your most inner desire
to become more free with your guts and feelings
E-E-E-ecstacy

Boy let me free your mind, lets hook up tonight
Take you on a flight, high, high
Make you warm inside, I won't waste you're time
My love is so divine, it feels like I'm on..

[Chorus: Missy]
Ecstaacyy, I'm willing, to do the things I said I wouldn't do
On ecstaacyy, the feeling makes me feel like I'm in love with you

[Missy]
Boy look into my eyes, I'm so energized
Make it last long time, touch mee
Everything feels sweet, my body feel your breeze
up all against me, it feels like I'm on..

[Chorus]

[Missy]
Oh it feels like I'm on, ecstaacyy
Everybody jump in and do something
Feel so free, I feel like making love to you
So what you wanna do? (AHH.. ahhh.. AHH!)

Ecstaacyy, everybody jump in and do something
Feel so free, I feel like making love to you
So what you wanna do? (AHH.. ahhh.. AHH!)

[Chorus] </pre>
