Uh, it's for the ladies
This if for the ladies
The ladies
This if for the ladies
The ladies
This thing right here

[Shaunta]
Shaunta real chick
Figure if we break up you can still hit
Negative!
I can have five minks
No care for what it is
I'm gone
You tell me it's hard, I bet it is
Hot chick, what I need your money for
Let you give me five karats
You know I'm twenty-four
Who you frontin' for?
You loved how I spit it
Take me to the mall
I see it, I want it, I get it
You used to hit my spots
Now you way off
Anytime I screamed your name that was a play off
Get it right you're just a horny mug
I have more fun riding Donny Park
Bottom line is you don't love me no more
That's cool, you crossed me, you lost me
That's the rule
Matter a fact I kinda dig your man
He look hotter
Shaunta I roll with Brandy and Ruff Ryders

[Brandy]
No you don't know me
Like you used to me
You don't know me like you used to
No you don't know me
Like you used to me
You don't know me like you used to

[Da Brat]
You don't love me
You make me wish that we'd never been in a deuce
It used to be lovely kissing you, hugging you too
But I gotta move on now, we're long down the road
I suppose you can close enough to get your clothes and stuff
Just bite the dust cause I just ain't liking us
We fight too much
And ain't tight enough to adjust
Where the mic? I bust make sure the money right
I must get that paper and hustle my whole life
Whether you with me or not
I'm greedy and gotta eat it
Take trips to the Bahamas quite frequently
If it's me you seeking, better swallow your pride
Cause when it's time to bail I ride
And I don't know why the twin roll
Feel it all in my bones
You say I don't give you chills no more
Don't come home
Da Brat baby back baby
Swizz Beats is on the track baby bounce
And almost don't count nigga

[Brandy]
No you don't know me
Like you used to me
You don't know me like you used to
No you don't know me
Like you used to me
You don't know me like you used to

[Eve]
Yo, yo when I'm supposed to wait
Eve guaranteed to escape
To the next end
With the next man full the plate
And yes damn I work fast
Leaving em stashed
Like a fresh pair of Tantrums
I ruin em fast
Move on so you wanna go
Cruise on
Could've hit me late night
Now you morning till dawn
Had to cut you off and treat you soft
And every day the same thing
Had you thinkin' bout me often
Pass me up
Chance of your lifetime
Tried to be your wife
I was giving you my lifeline
Did I scare you off?
Scared of the Ruff Rydin'
Knew you couldn't floss with a winner
Couldn't bust right
Used to be like a best friend
As the best man
You I picked over others now you desperate
Swizz bring it
And I give it for the double R
Not ready but still I'mma bubble hard

[Brandy]
No you don't know me
Like you used to me
You don't know me like you used to
No you don't know me
(U Don't Know Me, U Don't Know Me)
Like you used to me
(U don't know me like you used to)
You don't know me like you used to

[Swizz Beats]

All my ladies in here
Put your hands up in the air
All my ladies in here
Put your hands up in the air
All my ladies in here
I said put your hands up in the air
All my ladies in here
Put your hands up in the air
I said in the air
I said in the air
All my ladies in here
Put your hands up in the air
All my ladies in here
Put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air
I said in the air
I said in the air
All my ladies in here</pre>
