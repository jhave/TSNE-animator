[50 Cent]    (The Game)
Okay, whassup its ya boy 50 Cent (Yeah)
It's goin down right here you heard me? (I'm craaazy)
Off of The Massacre's (Aftermath)
Check it out (G-Unot!)

[Chorus - The Game]
Bitches only feel ya shit just a 'lil bit
Niggaz only feel ya shit just a 'lil bit
The hood only feel ya shit just a 'lil bit
Stop the singin' lets get back to some killa shit
(x2)

[Verse 1 - The Game]
Step up in the club they like who you wit
I'm signin' Dr. Dre not G-Unit
Red rag in my pocket feelin' old school
You forgot how bullets feel I'ma show you
I'm a gangsta I do what I want to
Ya time is up nigga I dun warned you
You got the police witchu nigga don't trip
I got a box of donuts and a whole clip
When it's time for beef he get his drink on
Animal Rights said kill 'em with that mink on
I'ma kick it by your car 'till it's time to go
And I won't leave the scene 'till the police show
Cause

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - The Game]
Remember 50, comin' out ya stereo
Sounded gangsta 'till he switched his flow
How many times I try to get you to hit the smo
Stop lyin' to the people you don't twist the dro
My tech, is fit, my clip is long
And the bloods, and crips, is on you dawg
They musta heard that you a ho
Got G-Unit airbrushed on ya top
Bring the pump in the club cause I'm hurtin' the kid
And I do these rap beefs all the time mayne
They say at summer jam, I turned it out
But Kanye and Hova killed it without a doubt
The rat came out dancin' like a pro, mayne
Punched him in the face the crowd was like "oh mayne"
Four months ago I was yellin' G-Unit
'Till I found out the nigga 5-0 was a snitch
Now

[Chorus]

[The Game]
It's Scott Storch you dumbass bitch

Storch mothafucker, Storch
Learn how to talk you fuckin' bitch
That's that muhfuckin hole in ya jaw huh?

Learn how to say a nigga name you dumbass faggot
Don't even know how to talk, and that's the reason..

[Chorus]
