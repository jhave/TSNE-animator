[Intro: Dolla Dolla]
I own the club, that's right - Dolla Dolla!
Make it rain on these hoes - T-Pain!
THE GANG! (You already know)
G-A-N-G (Konvict)

[Chorus]
I hit the club with a mug so mean got them niggaz like
WHO, THE FUCK IS THAT?
Then I hopped up out the car it's so clean, got them hoes like
WHO, THE FUCK IS THAT?
Goes like right, left, back, forth
Yeah I got money nigga that's, of cousrse
Hit the stage with a b-boy stance, the club owner like
WHO, THE FUCK IS THAT?

[Verse 1: Dolla]
Pull up in somethin tinted, 200 on the dash
Y'all shit rented, I drop cash
Watch the doors lift up, this nigga done went mad
I'm what you never had, some of this and some of that
Tell that bitch to give me kiss, then I smack her on the ass
Throw a stack at her and laugh, this shit to me ain't nothin
How much money do you have? That's not up for discussion
I be mashin out in somethin European on them buttons
I been rich since I'se eleven, my grams look like 7's
My killers look like reverands yeah you better count yo' blessings
Konvict piece around my neck, misdemeanor on my wrist
Got a felon on my pinky got you blinkin when it glist'
I got strippers on the payroll, Chargers in Diego
Llello like it's mayo, don't play 'round with me pesos
You should see the steelo, neighborhood Nino
Bitches call me dolla but these niggaz call me D-Bo

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Dolla]
Ay ay ay ay now I'm shinin like a motherfucker, VVS's blinkin
Steve Urkel by the ton, that purple steady stinkin
You talkin to the dick and I got swag, I got juice
See me in that Bentley coupe, right in front of run &amp; shoot
You be runnin when I shoot, I be shootin where you runnin
'Kon got me out the streets, told me Dolla get the money
Now I'm the club stuntin like LA, LA LA LAH
Laughin at these coward niggaz like HA, HA HA HAH
Look you fuckin with a winner, shrimp and lobster for the dinner
Veteran in the game you other niggaz just beginners
In my D-boy stance, 'bout to pop a rubber band
Fuck that fightin in the club, you niggaz fuckin up my plans
I'm tryin to get a dance, her name and her number
Take her to the telly get some brain in the Hummer
You niggaz make it rain, while Dolla make it thunder
Album comin soon, bitch get ready for the summer

[Chorus] - last two lines changed as below
Hit the stage with a b-boy stance
The club owner like OOOOH-WEEEEEEE~!

[Verse 3: Tay Dizm]
Ain't nuttin for me to come through and shut the club DOWWWN
Walk through the club mean muggin haters out
Drop a stack at the bar, hundred Louis 13
Posted up, CAMOUFLAGE DOWN TO MY FEET
They lookin at me like who is (who is) who is he?
A straight get'cha boy, been raised in the streets
If I'm on it you can smell it when I step in yo' room
Tay, D-I, 7 goes ZOOM!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Dolla]
I'm Dolla baby! G-A-N-G, T-Pain
Konvict, Dolla Dolla!
Y'all know the name, HA~!</pre>
