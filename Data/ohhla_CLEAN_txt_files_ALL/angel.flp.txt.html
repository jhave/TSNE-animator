[MC Piper]
Now you've been up and you've been down
Stayed strong even though daddy wasn't around
My momma through the thick and the thin beginning to end
And though I be sinning you keep me livin' with that love that you givin'
It's unconditional hey the sun shines when I see a smile on ya face
My momma with the money and jewels the record and tours
I'd give it away if I could make your days happy days
And when my hearts broke and can't cope I'm comin' on home
To remember the reason why I was born
Cuddle up inside your heavenly arms you help me weather the storm
You love music so I put it in song

[Chorus] (Steve Knight)
She's an Angel workin' on God's train
She's an Angel workin' on me
She's an Angel workin' on God's train
She's an Angel workin' on me

[Steve Knight]
I wasn't born wild you know you raised me right
But the roads of Alabama called me into the night
From the coke and the weed and extacy
I'm lost in the streets but you still remain next to me
The blood that I bleed it flows through your veins
Even in my lowest point I can still hear your words to my brain
First time I was arrested mommas love was tested
I couldn't contest it so here's my confession you're my blessing
You're the reason I believe you're the reason I sing
You're the reason angels tangle me in heavenly things
It's been a long road so hard and cold
But you keepin' me warm with your heart of gold

[Chorus]

*[MC Piper/Steve Knight every two lines]*
You're the light at the end of the tunnel the break of the day
After the darkest night chasing all the evil away
You're my flowers and sunshine cherries and red wine
Diamonds they can't find shining through hard times
You're the angel on Earth the proof there's a God
The reason to keep on going you're my light in the dark
The first star in the sky and the last to leave
And when I'm travelin' through the night I feel your light on me

[Chorus]</pre>
