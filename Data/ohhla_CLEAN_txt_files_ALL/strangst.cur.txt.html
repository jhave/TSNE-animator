Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Curren$y]
Yea dog, you don't think that I should just do it again tho?

[McKenzie Eddie]
This is... The strangest
Life that I... Have ever known
This is... The strangest
Life that I... Have ever known

[Curren$y]
This is... The strangest
Life that I... Have ever known
I wonder if... Me as a kid
Was proud of what I did
Now that I'm grown
10 Minutes from "ON"
And Lightyears from "OFF"
The once lowly employee, has wholly become a boss
Champagne with French names
French connection tees on wirey and sexy frames
Living like a nigga can't feel no pain...

This is... The strangest
Life that I... Have ever known
I wonder if... My parent's give me
Benefit of the doubt
Or do they think its more than it's weed I'm on
Living like a nigga can't feel no pain
Living like a nigga can't... feel

Yeah
Yea, That's it</pre>
