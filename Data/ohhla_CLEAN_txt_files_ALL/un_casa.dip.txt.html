[Un Casa]

It's a shame how I rap so bananas
It's Mr. Two-Gun Un
Mother fuckers better cock back them hammers
You might catch in the drop blowin pop wit Santana
The hawk on me's not from Atlanta
It's just the father to the glocks in the hamper
Look in the rear view the cops in the camera
I flow hot like blocks down in Tampa
And leave you dead pop shot from them glammers
And go down south and rock wit them bamas
And come back in the Porsche color hot banana
Vanilla coat seats piper made by Tropicana
Speakers do the wop rims do the Macerana
This is Taliban Dipset Rocafella
It ain't nuthin for Two-Gun ta pop a fella
Killa signed me now I got the mozerella
I promised Hell Rell Un Cas gone rock forever

[Un Casa] + (Cam'Ron)

What's really good flee what's really good
(Aiight flee I mean that, that that's what's really good
I can't front)
Well what's really good can I finish
(I mean I mean what's really good hold up Two-Gun
I'ma let you finish I mean What's really really good now)
What's really good
(I mean What's really good)
What's really good
(I mean you did your thing I'm wit you what's really good
Lets finish up let's right what's really good)

[Un Casa]

Yo I'm living in tha equinox
Niggaz eat wit glocks
Enough steel it'll cease the block
Add yeast to increase the rock
I got knowledge that can teach my pops
Watch my pockets increase ta knots
Play the low so I speak ta cops
Walk the beat in my bop an my beef and brocs
Ice in my piece an watch
Ain't too many niggaz that can reach the top
Or speak this hot
Peep this pop I leave you not
I rhyme over beats wit the meanest drops
And teens'll flock
Seen my spot an seen my props
Red when you seen the cops
Got your wife suckin siemen cock
I'ma Taliban lyrical monster
They'll shout the city I conqour
White Ice cinnamin Parker
Al Quiada's most vividest author
Hundered thou just ta glitter the charm up
45th sides prettiest monster
The truck look like the city of Tonka
Dame here ta say this nigga is bonkers
Whoa far as tha flow I'm the realest nigga spittin it
Niggaz talk hustle game but I'm really gettin it
Anything I want an need nigga I'm gettin it
745 Gucci top wit tha stick in it
The ice is so clear like the shit fishes swimmin in
I ain't Diddy y'all but I'm strictly for the benjamins
I'm tha boss I ain't dealin wit you middle men
Bout ta cop a Yukon white made in cinnamin

[Un Casa] + (Cam'Ron)
Niggaz get ya'll fuckin car game up
(Diplomats that's what's really fuckin good)
