[Lil' Flip]
The remix... Lil' Flip...Juvnile...
Skip...I Can Do Dat...
Suckafree  U.T.P

If spill drank on my shirt (I can do dat)
It don't matter, I got a lotta Iceberg (I can do dat)
I'ma spend 180 on the house (I can do dat)
'Cause I ain't got a lady or a spouse (I can do dat)
You know I'm ridin' S-Type Jag's (I can do dat)
No belt, so my Guess might sag (I can do dat)
Cartier is my wrist-wear (I can do dat)
My bank account similar to Ric Flair's (I can do dat)
Next week I got a show in the Dirty (I can do dat)
And everyday I wear a throwback jersey (I can do dat)
I'ma fly to Miami for a night (I can do dat)
We front row and the Roy Jones fight (I can do dat)
I just got a deal for 20 Mill' (I can do dat)
I'm like U.G.K 'cause I'm trill (I can do dat)
And I put new platinum in my grill (I can do dat)
And guess what, I did that before the deal (I can do dat)

[Juvenile]
I still wear boxers wit Girbauds (I can do dat)
I can bag a whole block full of O's (I can do dat)
Throw a free party in the Tunnel (I can do dat)
Nigga sip syrup through a funnel (I can do dat)
Turn a housewife into a hoe (I can do dat)
Stash a quarter million in the flo' (I can do dat)
Call a private meeting wit the mayor (I can do dat)
Tell him, "Quit hatin' 'cause I'm a playa" (I can do dat)
I when in the business talkin' in Ebonics (I can do dat)
Fly to California for the chronic (I can do dat)
Park my Rolls Royce in the 'jects (I can do dat)
Put 23's on my new Lex' (I can do dat) 
Pass on a sale for ten ki's (I can do dat)
A palm tree hit for 10 G's (I can do dat)
Come through this bitch wit no clique (I can do dat)
Spit the remix wit Lil' Flip (I can do dat)

[Chorus  Lil' Flip]
Hey, so if you see it  take it
I wreck  shake it
Money  make it
Microphone  break it
If you see it  want it
Buy it  own it
Drive it  flaunt it
Factory  chrome it

[Skip]
I can turn a block into three (I can do dat)
Turn around a sell 'em all for cheap (I can do dat)
Hustle one day of the week (I can do dat)
The other six I smoke weed and sleep (I can do dat)
Can a plane from N.O to the 'Ville (I can do dat)
I'ma blow about a half a quarter mill' (I can do dat)
Then fly from the 'Ville to H-Town (I can do dat)
Yo Lil' Flip, man I just touched down (I can do dat)
Nigga, I'm forever like Botany (I can do dat)
Meet me right here, C-Note got me (I can do dat)
Don't make me have to call Will Lean (I can do dat)
Shouts out to my partner Mean Green (I can do dat)

[Lil' Flip]
I still throw money at my shows (I can do dat)
Still look funny wearin' gold (you can do dat)
I stopped wearin' gold last year (I can do dat)
And I get more sex then the past year (I can do dat)
I still got rocks on my wrist (I can do dat)
I still never shop for a chick (I can do dat)
I still got them bricks on the strip (I can do dat)
Who run the south?  Juvenile and Lil' Flip (we can do dat)
I threw 20's on the Land Rover (I can do dat)
I talk shit 'cause I'm a Cloverland Soulja (I can do dat)
Fly to A.T.L and get drunk (I can do dat)
Blow a whole ounce wit Lil' Jon (I can do dat)
Hit Dayton for a week (I can do dat)
I had a show wit Eightball &amp; MJG (I can do dat)
It only took a year and now I blew up (I can do dat)
But for DJ Screw, I'm gon' stay screwed up
stay screwed up (I can do dat)
