Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Scoop DeVille]
Cause it was all meant to happen
It was all meant to happen
No wonder why you kept walkin' my way
Cause it was all meant to happen
It was all meant to happen
No wonder why you kept walkin'

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
My mom was 18, waitin' for her prom date
Which was my father, yes, this night's gonna be beyond great
Two years prior they both created Aaron Yates
So the bond straight with two fine mates, so mom waits
And waits, in the upstairs window watchin'
For my pops and it was shockin' that he never ever came knockin'
Just left her, in her prom dress and that's the eve
Where all the stress hit aggressively, she had her first epileptic seizure
And kept havin' them, doctor, help the sick lady
Medicine with the quickness, just maybe it'll stop
'Member this, in '80 I was, nine
Asleep and I heard somethin' collapse
Hopped up with nothin' but tighty whitie
Saw my mom just fell and slapped the floor
She shakin', I'm scared, I ran out the house in my underwear
"Help my mama" is all that's comin' out my mouth
A neighbor came to help so mama wouldn't die
As a little kid, watchin' the ambulance take her away, I'm thinkin' "Why?"

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
'92, I was 21
Sellin' rocks for my auntie, was plenty fun
And yes she loaded the house with many guns
She got me a TEC-9 for my birthday, "No more trippin' from anyone"
Is what Iâm thinkin', Boones Farmâs what Iâm drinkin'
Singin' Jodeci loaded, we exploded, these chicks Iâm binkin'
Daily, nightly, the ladies like me, Iâm baby Ikie,
Maybe slightly, Iâm crazy might be
Really shady, sheisty not like this though
Iâm sleepin' again, this dude breaks in with a pistol
I heard his bullet whistle, so I had to roll of on this flo'
Heard a struggle then my auntie scream, Iâm feelin' for my piece
Then, just my luck, my birthday gift that I got wasn't in my reach
The gunman busted in my room lookin' for somethin'
Found me hidin', pointed the gun right at my head, my heart was pumpin'
Then he turned and ran away then with a blink of an eye
He was gone, I found my auntie shakin', hidin' in the closet, Iâm thinkin' "Why?"

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Dear Darkness, you've been with me for so long
I never understood, 'til now in this slow song
Been in some shaky situations, but life goes on
But still, a lot of things you showed this kid was so wrong
But what's so right, this pain and strife that I go write
People go buy it, they think that my flow's tight
Got a cold mic, they got me a million sold twice
Not a low-life anymore itâs always sold-out show nights
After K.O.D. you scared me, so I ran from you
Then accepted you on Seepage, then saw the fans come through
Just when I thought I took everything I can stand from you
I kept writing and then we watched the Strangeland come true
So now I see, these stories in my life
I was meant to share my darkness within my light
People say it helps them to see me fly
From the bottom, thatâs motivation for them all, now I see exactly why
