Now if you want it boy
You know where I'm at boy
Now if you want it boy
You know where I be's boy

[Lord Infamous]:
I'm on South Memphis cause I am the king of SPV
I'm on South Memphis, ask them niggas down on Victor Street
I'm on South Memphis, just like ellas and a sofa plate
I'm on South Memphis like a razor and a saucer tray
I'm on South Memphis like some junkies at a carwash
I'm on South Memphis hit the southside strip at 2o'clock
I'm on South Memphis, always killin up at night and day
I'm on South Memphis cause I always got a bag of bay
I'm on South Memphis at the club going to Funkytown
That's when you got the pinky finger and your thumb stuck out 
I'm on South Memphis, yeah Funkytown, Chronic City
I'm on South Memphis cause I like my serve thick and gritty
I'm on South Memphis, I still cash my checks at liquor stores
I'm on South Memphis, found a home craving for ho-hoes
I'm on South Memphis, my hair chopped at Mr. Wynn's shop
I'm on South Memphis, must have problem with Lord Infamous?

Now if you want it boy
You know where I'm at boy
Now if you want it boy
You know where I be's boy

[Project Pat]:
I'm more North Memphis that a V-curl that ain't done
I'm more North Memphis than a car thief on the run
I'm more North Memphis than some dog food up my nose
I'm more North Memphis in the hood scoopin junkie hoes
I'm more North Memphis, house full of hoes fixin hair
While I'm in the back selling crack, weed in the air
I'm more North Memphis then the store called Metro Market
I'm in that motherfucker, stealing, money in my pockets
I'm so North Memphis, just like dope fiends after dark
Buck wild as hell , like the short end of Hyde Park
I'm more North Memphis than a drug deal going bad
The dope ain't jumpin back, right dog you been had
I'm more North Memphis, in the hood club startin shit
I'm more North Memphis while in mall whoopin on a bitch
I'm more North Memphis dice all night on the porch
Drinkin on Pauley Mooson, we ain't do the torch

You know where I'm at boy

[DJ Paul]:
I'm more Black Haven than a dodge throw, Dodger dog
I'm more Black Haven than a motherfuckin South Flag Mall
I'm more Black Haven than a Chevy wit new front and back
It's mismatched, cause a nigga ain't even paint it yet
I'm more Black Haven than the burns on Elvis Presley, ya hear
I'm more Black Haven than the nigga sayin burn somethin here
I'm more Black Haven than them niggas buck at Hillcrest
You tryin to test, I hope you got something to protect your chest

[Frayser Boy]:
Yo, nigga I'm more Frayser than a nigga sellin dope from payphones
Nigga I'm more Frayser, when I'm mobbin in my drawer there's the tone
Nigga I'm more Frayser got a dirty gimme cap in the car
Nigga I'm more Frayser, a ho was ugly but she think she a star
Nigga I'm more Frayser, got my beer wrapped in a brown paper sack
Nigga I'm more Frayser, robbin niggas wit no bullets in gat
Nigga I'm more Frayser than a nigga wildin in a box Chevy
Nigga I'm more Frayser, put two dollars in the tank and regret it
