This is what you want
(Dear God)

Verse 1:
[Bad A$$]
My life,
the race against time I beat
Cause my time will reach the finishline
before my life complete
I can't complain
so I'm livin' in this world so cold
It's on my mind, 
I try to keep my soul
I used to be the female, real
Cause you can't think without your mind
Kill your brain
Body's nothin' but your soul still remain
Some game this is (What a game this is)
What a shame this is
How they use they punks to screw us
Than pull they guns and do us

Chorus:
[Woman overlaps Bad A$$]
Dear God can call out my name, we cryin' out
Brave Lord can stay with us here, we dyin' out
Dear God
Can you ever strut in the struggle of the day
We're callin' on you
Show us on our way (show us on our way)
We're gettin' older
In that game
And who's to blame?
Who's to blame?

Verse 2:
[Bad A$$ overlaps woman]
They never use money 
(?)
Get your debt in control
Mind your friends or mind your fo's
They plot 'gainst the man
And his plan since the days away
Back when the calendar was made
But society falls
Merry earthquakes will top
Then never will it work
Revelations, you die
It's an eye for eye
So when he bite style we fire
To see livin' on earth in life is mighty die
But it's a new world order
And if you have some success (Dear God)
Then you're a victim of the system
Find peace to rest

Chorus:
[Woman]
Dear God
Can you ever strut in the struggle of the day
We're callin' on you
Show us on our way (show us on our way)
We're gettin' older
In that game
And who's to blame?
Who's to blame?

Verse 3:
[Tray Deee overlaps woman]
I hit list to get chips
Big flip I peel
Not afraid of gangstas (?) the real
Caught up in the game
Now only rule survival
To be the next nigga 
I see who's my rival (Dear God)
My world, were I come from
Is steady slump one
Runnin' up and commin' up with slugs,
cause they dump done (Dear God)
I'm on a mash but my cash and fashion
Askin' no questions, react to blastin'
Now who can I blank for my aim to win
And my deepest succeed try the game to end
(Dear God can call out my name, we cryin' out 
Dear God)
Up against and the ends and I dissed a cop
Made objectives to check chin and hit the top
Fuck the obstacles, my optic will provide the sight
For me to view, what to do as I grime and stripe (Dear God)
The right way might pay
But I can't wait long
So I never hesitates to get my page on
 
Chorus:
[Woman]
Dear God
Can you ever strut in the struggle of the day
We're callin' on you
Show us on our way (show us on our way)
We're gettin' older (grow on up)
In that game (in that game)
And who's to blame?
Who's to blame?

Verse 4: 
[Bad A$$]
Now you can blame it on the block
You can blame it on glocks
You can blame it on the cocaine
Blame it on the brain, shit
Everythang happens fo' a reason
So why ask why
Just live it up you gotta die, die (Dear God)
If they wanted us to live (Dear God)
They wouldn't brainwashed our kids (Dear God)
You're struck, 
body old enough to fuck and buck a nut (Dear God)
That's the way they statin'
Beat they ass pork
and be gone
Cancer and alcohol
Cut they life short 
It's time to live
Might forgive the devil and his dollar
Two world gon' make it right
But it's a 'must' and not a 'might'
Let's do one to others
As they do one to you
You drug down on me
I put two guns on you

Chorus:
[Woman]
Dear God
Can you ever strut in the struggle of the day 
(Can you ever strut)
We're callin' on you
Show us on our way (show us on our way)
We're gettin' older
In that game
(Older in that game)
And who's to blame?
Who's to blame?

Dear God can call out my name, we cryin' out
Brave Lord can stay with us here, we dyin' out
Dear God, Dear God, Dear God

Dear God
Can you ever strut in the struggle of the day 
We're callin' on you
Show us on our way (show us on our way)
We're gettin' older
In that game
And who's to blame?
Who's to blame?

Dear God can call out my name, we cryin' out
Brave Lord can stay with us here, we dyin' out
Dear God, Dear God</pre>
