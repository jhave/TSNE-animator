Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x2]
I like 'them girl named Keisha
My weed I call it Keisha
Need 20k for a fiji
Met a whole world saying they Keisha
That Keisha, ye there might what we hope
Either way boy you wouldn't know
What I'm talking 'bout

[Verse 1]
Had to catch my breath
These nigga wanna hold me back
But I'm the ref
And your bitch she wanna catch myself
I mean, catch me
And her ass look grand they nasty
'Cause she nasty
Roll another one up boy
Y'all ain't gotta ask me
I'm faded, call me Bob Marley
And I keep on making hits I'm sorry
No Ciara, but tell me who can do it better
I'm in a lever, and I'm sitting on lever
And I'm gripping that leather
That's that Oldfield filth
Smoking on a spilf, no spilf TV
But I'm spiffing hoe call 'em cowards come and take a pee

[Chorus: x2]
I like 'them girl named Keisha
My weed I call it Keisha
Need 20k for a fiji
Met a whole world saying they Keisha
That Keisha, ye there might what we hope
Either way boy you wouldn't know
What I'm talking 'bout

[Verse 2]
I'm paid in full hoe call me Mitch
Why you looking like that 'cause a nigga getting rich
And I bet your nigga can't do it like this
Ball, stunt hard, get in that pussy
Go hard, then smoke a blunt
Rub my money out 'cause I love to stunt
That why I got hella paid
Kept gliding to the top check the name's on elevator
How the hell he eating on gator
And he walking on game
Talking to the lakers, come on Bryant what he do
And if I might may live look Brown what we do
Told 'em on and bring that instagrams
And I know I hurt their feelings
When we said we own instagrams

[Chorus: x2]
I like 'them girl named Keisha
My weed I call it Keisha
Need 20k for a fiji
Met a whole world saying they Keisha
That Keisha, ye there might what we hope
Either way boy you wouldn't know
What I'm talking 'bout</pre>
