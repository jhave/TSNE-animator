[Chorus]
Ridin round the city, with some brand new heat
Brand new car, brand new feet
Brand new seats, brand new smell
Put out the roach, light a brand new L

[Hook]
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin brand new
Fuck you bitch, my shirt brand new
Fuck you bitch, my shoes brand new
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin brand new

[Lil Wayne]
I'm cold like a midnight in Aspin
I am a president, and the assassin
Cameras on, big lights, action
Welcome to the show, I am the main attraction
Money in the mattress, money in the attic
Money on my mind, money is my habit
Stay on the grind, until money's automatic
Bitch I love money, I'ma fuckin fanatic
Always strapped, gripped type graspin
Say what? Who me? Click clack, blast em
Chrome 24s tires thin like, napkin
Gotta ride big, cause I am like a captain
You know I'm a boss, chillin, relaxin
Probably in my office, doin my taxes
You litte niggas, so not in my bracket
And I don't even have time to practice

[Chorus]

[Hook]

Fuck you bitch, I'm actin brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch, my shirt brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch, my shoes brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin brand new (brand new)

[Lil Wayne]
Tight, ridiculous price
Ya camera has never saw a picture this nice
I'm fishin and the bitches will bite
It's probably cause my game is fixodent tight
Right, I'm fuckin every bad bitch twice
And if she doesn't wear panties, then I fuck her on sight
I'm nasty like Spice, I know what she likes
I could make a black women scream, like she white
I can make a white woman scream, like Mike
But before she start singin, she gotta check my mic
Niggas just hatin, and I done lost sight
It's like I don't see 'em, I only see the light
Talkin that shit, but you boys just hype
I hope you bring a gun to the fight
Aight, Louis V. tennis shoes, big brown stripe
You think you fresh, shit nigga, I'm ripe

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch, my shirt brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch, my shoes brand new (them too)
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin brand new (okay)

[Lil Wayne]
Brand new coupe, drivin crazy then a mothas
Sittin low in the seats, with the burners sittin under
Got my tank-top, top down, it probably aint summer
But I ride like that, cause I'm hotter then them others
Damn, it's no keep up with the brother man
I could spekk my name, in burnt rubber
I'm gone, leave me alone, while the dog is at supper
You could wash my plate, and put it back in the cupboard
Uh um, I'm so far ahead of them suckers
I'ma hafta start rappin in numbers
I promise the flow don't stop, they come rappin like thunder
I bet you hide under your covers

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch, my shirt brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch, my shoes brand new (them too)
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin brand new (yah)</pre>
