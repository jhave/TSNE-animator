[Intro: Cno Evil]
Yeah, you know how it is
I don't give a fuck if y'all don't like my shit
Fuck it, I'm just a poet rocking a hoodie, kid
I'm a rapper, you know how it is
We don't party like rock stars, we lounge like rap stars

[Cno Evil]
I'mma take you inside of a legendary mind
Where we work and we grind, for the bread and the wine
Rodentz combine, and we won't stop til we're signed
What a find, so be kind and rewind
The blind are mostly intrigued by the drum
That's why I come, with the rump-a-pum-pum
Add it for the sum, before the moon, comes the sun
That's why I run like a war has begun
While you grab your gun, I grab my microphone
Enter the Red Zone, where the faces are unknown
The force of a cyclone, so take your ass home
Call me the paleontologist, kid, pass the bone
Pass the liquor, this kid is much slicker
Much quicker, got more nuts than those Snickers
See the flicker? Blood is much thicker
Pass the antidote, cuz the kid is getting sicker
I murder shit like Albert Anastasia
While Mouse does some magical shit, like it's Fantasia
New Malaysia, kid, pass the chopsticks
Jump into this, like the beat is a mosh pit
Run the cockpit, back door, I lock it
You can't stop it, I'm passing the object
Like asteroids, you can't blast the boy
I go faster, boy, you wack plastic toy
Leave you destroyed, like your body after steroids
I'm a psycho, analyze me like Sigmund Freud
Hope you enjoyed your job, cuz now you unemployed
Don't get too attached to me, I'm just a decoy

[Chorus 2X: Cno Evil]
White Plains, inject this in your veins
White Plains, infect this in your brain
White Plains, connect shit like your chain
White Plains, direct hits to your remains

[Interlude: Cno Evil]
White Plains, kid, what you know about?
White Plains, kid, you know where we live at
White Plains, kid, that's how we represent
White Plains, kid, you know how it is
Cno Evil, ahh shit, what happened...

[sample]
I can't hold this state, anymore
Understand me, anymore
To dread this fantasy, openly, what have I done?
Or this uncertainty, is taking me over
I can't --

[Li-Mouse]
Now ya'll, need to, listen up closely
Ya'll rhyme about selves, mine murder mostly
Cats with wack raps that make fake tracks
And spit false facts, watch how I react
Like Mentos in some, cups of Pepsi
Fucking with me, I'mma leave shit real messy
Like toddlers in a room with a bunch of Legos
Make it hot like you about to, eat a bunch of Eggo's
I'll digest any of those lines you throw at me
Li-Mouse in this house, but you can't trap me
See, I don't go for the cheese directly
Come through the back when ya'll, can't detect me
Like stealth bombers, flying over Iraq
Then I create tornadoes when I flap
Hot like wings, the wind overthrows kings
And new music is born like plant life in Spring
Across the globe, I'm attacking your earlobes
Quickly no chance, before your brain blows
What happen? I ain't talking bout scrapping
Your girl's with me, on the Bridge, and you can say I'm tapping it
Ya'll can't mess with my rapping
Cuz intelligence and finesse is what you lacking, muthafucka </pre>
