[Chorus - Kirko Bangz]
She say I'm trynna make this work, you're doin' it again
Fuck this shit, I'm out this bitch
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
She tell me
"you could have that bitch, you ain't bout shit
fuck this shit, I'm out this bitch"
She like "fuck that shit"
She got me like "fuck that bitch!"
Say I'm out this bitch..

Same old nigga making stuck in the day
She the same since highschool back in the day
Cute face, deep eyes, with the low beety ways
Says she just finished school, now she worked at a bank
Now I'm all in the bank, all in the bank
probably with some niggaz that be rob in the bank
Rob in the bank, now it's all in the paper
and she told me all about it, said I wanna see you later
But I'm into deep, she said she's got a nigga, but the nigga wakes
And I had a bitch, but she told me she's too mean
And I wanna see you, call me when the nigga leave
You know I'd be right back over, spend the night over
Mixing me a cup, she don't like being sober
In love with a man, so she says, is getting late
Can't stay, now we are back arguing

She say I'm trynna make this work, you're doin' it again
Fuck this shit, I'm out this bitch
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
She tell me
"you could have that bitch, you ain't bout shit
fuck this shit, I'm out this bitch"
She like "fuck that shit"
She got me like "fuck that bitch!"
Say I'm out this bitch..

Now I'm right back in the same position
with the same bitch that I said I was quitting a minute ago
I'm out of control, over these hoes, dealing with emotions I don't wanna show
It's like one or two flaws, don't wanna be involved with her at all
Tired of waiting, I'm getting impatient
she is lately with her best friend and the head game's crazy
Single now, living life while I'm on a deadly
Ain't got time for no sorry, just brought a Ferrari
Cost me two eighty, now these bitches wanna call me by my real name
Baby, ain't got time for no motherfucking questions
To my ex's, hope you learned your lesson
While you're out stressing I'm somewhere out sexing
On to the next one, on to the next thing
No, you ain't tripping
All on your TV, now she wanna text me

She say I'm trynna make this work, you're doin' it again
Fuck this shit, I'm out this bitch
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
She tell me
"you could have that bitch, you ain't bout shit
fuck this shit, I'm out this bitch"
She like "fuck that shit"
She got me like "fuck that bitch!"
Say I'm out this bitch..

Say I'm out this bitch, say I'm out this bitch</pre>
