[MF Doom]
...Give it a sec for the pain to start
This wreck right here it ain't for the faint of heart
They thought they saw the worst verse
From the team of G men who seem like nerds at first
Once they get to know us people dig us
Leaders in the fight for equal rights for niggaz
Inventor of the more demented flow nobody doubt it
This go for if ya bout it bout it or rowdy rowdy
Whatevers clever the master fold
Who every hooka heard a but now HO NO
If we see tomorrow the next day classes
The villain in the back with the x-ray glasses (*Pause*)
Have no fear the ninja here
Feel em like the tinge in ya ear from drinkin ginger beer
When it's on loco head gon' lay low
And heat it like beef patty coco bread con queso
If you say so lace the whole case load
They say he wear a metal mask in case his face show
He told em they flows is bitch talk and ayo's
His whole crew walk with pitchfork and halo's
Say OH if you never worked a J-O
And keep more cash then a stash in a peso
Okay yo ya'll know who to follow
Tie em up in the crib and leave the place hollow
..Oh shoot the goose shes loose
So wild you couldnt chase it down with straight fruit juice
Frown like the first time you taste cous cous
Stash the deuce deuce
Troops askin truce truce
Today on intense wreck week
We have the super villain in his own defense to speak
It's all part of my mental techniques
Available to freaks and pencil neck geeks
Train the same brain to a insane train of thought
On a campaign trail he came to gain ya support
Charge cash for a autograph
Say some shit to make ya daughta laugh
Then slaughta the ass
Seem em on the big screen like Steve McQueen
Do something and never be back once he leave the scene
Keep more medicated pads then Stridex
For his own sidewrecks with no known side effects
Before you press charges use ya noodle
So what when he grab the mic he scratch ya cute cuticles
Keep ya mouth shut everything'll be beautiful
It would be often rude to you now get back to ya hooty hoo
Damnit it ain't worth the drama can it
From the calm bandit eat rhymers like pomegranate
Soon as he stepped in he lit the room
Boom reschedule my noon with Britt Hume (Doom!)
In love with Mary Jane she's my main thing
Pulled her right from that webhead what a lame brain
Maintain say it dont spray it
Wanna see ya girl again ya might as well pay it
If I had a dime for every rhymer who bust guns
I'll have a cool mill for my sons in trust funds
When I was broker than a broke dick dog
I always kept a L to smoke in thick fog
When it rain it sure do thunderstorm
I got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms
One two microphone checker
First learned to neck off a Home-Ec homewrecker
This is back when he was like crib age
When he hit the stage its like a gauge to the rib cage
Break the mic like a rock star break a guitar
Jump off the stage like "Yee haw!"</pre>
