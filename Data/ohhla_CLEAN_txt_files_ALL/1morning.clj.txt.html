[LL Cool J]
It's one in the mornin - you know what time it is!
It's one in the mornin
It's one in the mornin - you gonna have come out your clothes on this one
It's one in the mornin

Yeah I'm still at it, the microphone addict
You get your dome splattered, cause homey will not have it
Your ashes get scattered across the Atlantic
For actin like you a teenage chick with her bra padded
You might laugh at it, but if you do the knowledge
It's really a tad tragic how they runnin through they cabbage
You know my track record, L battle like a savage
I think and grow rich, that gives me the advantage
Uncle LL, I got product for sale
So I can bail Al Sharpton out of jail
Somebody gotta do it, somebody in the black community
gotta get this money while y'all march for unity
So march on, I'ma get my Bentley park on
Then get my dogs a platform to bark on
The realest brother, you Nicole Kidman, one of 'The Others'
Children shiverin under the covers
The man in black, the tilted Fedora hat
I'm bringin it raw, you never want your money back
I'm focused baby, livin like a quarterback
Playin in the wishbone, L keep options black
Systematically, burn you like calories
Watch your mouth, go earn your lil' salary
I'm a classic like Nike Airs and Wallabees
You could catch it like the flu, homey follow me

[Chorus]
It's one in the mornin - flash the dough
It's one in the mornin - crack the Mo'
It's one in the mornin - get on the flo'
It's one in the mornin - who wanna go?

[LL Cool J]
That's right Sleeping Beauty, wake up see the light
That Tylenol PM got you caught for your BM
Everybody can see I'm the king of rippin coliseums
C'mon, youse a male groupie beggin for per diem
A fruitcake laid out in the masoleum
I'm the richest man in Babylon, nobody could see him
Money's my slave, it do what I say
It cry for me, like Denzel in "Glory"
But I broke the cycle, no more poverty
I wonder if you hatin on the low - probably!
But cats know I'm real, I keep 'em on they heels
Damn!  Look at my body, coulda been a Navy Seal
But you lack the discipline to do what I do
Reinvention, I'm in the 11th dimension
I'm a value stock pop, get it while it's hot
Cause once I blow, I'ma split and that's it

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[LL Cool J]
Aiyyo E it's one o'clock
Time to get one and bounce baby
It's time to get one and bounce, you know what time it is

Your honor, last week he punched me in my face
I want twenty million, you know he liftin weights
Last week, me and the President was takin flicks
Last week, my video dropped and you was sick
Last week, I copped my lil' shorty some kicks
that cost 29 hundred, homey you don't want it
My ears stay flooded like your man stay blunted
My American Express is Black, I'm at the Summit
The Benjamin Grier of Def Jam, y'all know
My po'tfolio was sicker than polio
For real God is good, he took me out the hood
Got me livin in a mansion like a big boy should
And I never do Cribs, I ain't gonna have y'all fruitcakes
knowin how I live, bed extra big
You sit around, run your mouth, POTbelly on the couch
Claimin you hot but honey what you wove out
When she alone, pump L, I make her bounce
You on the corner riskin your life to sell a ounce
Wish you was Pablo, lay in the carbo
With a chick named Margo who flew from Chicago
But no, in real life cats catch it
It's not what you expected huh?  Life kinda hectic huh?

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[LL Cool J]
Yeah yeah
It's the definition
