[Master P] - {repeat 3X}
See I like to smoke weed and I love to make money
But I, can't live without you beautiful ghetto honeys

[Master P]
Now if that nigga doin wrong, and you don't want to be alone
Girl call me on the phone, or you can beep me in the zone
I'm mean holla if you wit me, if you need me come and get me
You want me to box him tell him hit me
See you too pretty to be a ??
If you was mines I'd make you shine like a flower
I don't give a fuck, how much money, how much power
I wanna make you my lady, if you tired of bein his bitch
See the nigga wanna see you broke, but I wanna see you rich
And I ain't playin no games, I wanna make you out my boonapalist
Girl keep your head up, and can't no nigga stop this, ya heard me?

[Master P] - {repeat 4X}
See I like to smoke weed and I love to make money
But I, can't live without you beautiful ghetto honeys

[Mac]
Yo, I look at you and praise you as if you a Goddess, but you modest
And word on the street, say you the hottest now why is this
so familiar, some niggaz'll kill just to be near ya
But you like my niggaz itchin, sayin that they gon' get ya
You ain't never had real love, cause all you fuck wit
is little thugs who deal drugs, you need a soldier
A nigga dat'll ride, nigga, that'll die
Nigga - to say you beautiful, and you my butterfly
I remember, when you was just a caterpillar
Ponytails and overalls, with Wonder Woman drawers
Everybody made they passes, laughin about yo' glasses
And now niggaz sweat you just because of how fat that ass is
I know you love that attention, ain't nuthin wrong with it
But you ain't gotta let every nigga you've known hit it
You a Queen, and I'ma make you shine like the brightest of stars
Keep you in the tightest of cars, you feel me?

[Master P] - {repeat 4X}
See I like to smoke weed and I love to make money
But I, can't live without you beautiful ghetto honeys</pre>
