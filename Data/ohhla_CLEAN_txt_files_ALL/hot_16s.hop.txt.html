[Intro]
See the difference between me and you is
You think there's no difference between me and you
Baby, Hopsin is in the building! (I'm RAW) We gone have one hell of a time
RIGHT NOW!

[Hopsin]
Who am I? a snobby and deadly poet
So nigga put down the pen cause I probably already wrote it
I'm the nigga that Hollywood barely noticed
For pullin cards, it's easy as sockin on Gary Coleman
How did you get a deal without havin no type of talent
The shit you write is invalid, you gettin your mic impounded
I'm livin in a dump, you livin life in a palace
Dinin with Caesar salad, man how do you guys allow it
Yo, you weak niggaz in the limelight trippin'
But I won't let you slide like friction
Not tryna be ya buddy in this rap shit, I like dissin'
So you can kiss my ass and watch the white eyes glisten
Ya'll nigga's be regulatin the area
Hesitatin to scare to some defamation of character
I got it locked no separatin the barriers
Medicate your hysteria, heaven's waitin to carry ya

[Chorus]
My hot 16's be on that ill shit! (uh huh)
Your hot 16's deal with the children (uh huh)
Baby, Hopsin is in the building! (you know) We gone have one hell of a time
RIGHT NOW!

[Hopsin]
I'm a pro but I kick it with the beginners
That what I whip up for dinner it's been up on my agenda
I came and left but now I'm finna re-enter
Shiver-me-timbers, how the fuck can a nigga be realer?
I don't know but my flow, is so cold, mistah oh no
At your door, I'm ready fo' war
When you was flossin on me tryna swerve in your hummer
I was plottin way bigger nigga, word to your mother
My verses are butter, I emerge from the gutter
To step up inside the booth and then work mothafuckers
I'm hungry as all of the roaches that lurk in my cupboard
You should be duckin and runnin', send the word to the others
I'm a fuckin nightmare in your worst hell
And I'm leavin nigga's stuck behind the bars, they don't deserve bail
You see wackness doesn't sit on my nerves well
You couldn't bust with a dick full of sperm cells

[Chorus]
My hot 16's be on that ill shit! (uh uh)
Your hot 16's deal with the children (uh huh)
Baby, Hopsin is in the building! (you know) We gone have one hell of a time
RIGHT NOW!

[Hopsin]
You see I'm lyrically bashin up on your feelings
I'm bad and I don't conceal it, this dragon is known for killin'
That's the reason I'm baggin these hoes and grillin'
My madness is so appealin and swagger is on a billion
Aside from all the provocative hellishness
I'm somewhat underground, but got the commercial elements
Accordin to ruthless records it wasn't evident
So I'm a 9/11 the label bitches to hell with it
I'm that crazy nigga, you can't be iller
I'll pick ya fuckin mom up in a 18-wheeler
Yeah I'll hit it, but if she don't wanna pay me scrilla
I'll let a rottweiler fuck her till the rabies kill her
My hobbies are rappin vicious, slappin bitches
Grabbin digits, and I occasionally laugh at midgets
I'm hardly sane and half horific with a dab of mischief
Never rap no shit if I haven't lived it, it's that specific

[Chorus]
My hot 16's be on that ill shit (uh huh)
Your hot 16's deal with the children (uh huh)
Baby, Hopsin is in the building! (you know) We gone have one hell of a time
RIGHT NOW!

[Outro]
