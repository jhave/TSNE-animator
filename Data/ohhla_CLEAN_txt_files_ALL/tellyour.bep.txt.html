Typed by: ermontoya@hotmail.com

Everybody gather 'round, this is a test
Dancin', dancin', dancin', dancin'
Dancin', dancin', dancin', dancin'
Dancin', dancin', dancin', dancin'
Dancin', dancin', dancin', dancin'

(Will)
Yo, you and you, you and you and you
All of y'all invited to come kick it with my crew
I get you all excited if I tell you what we do
Just come along and tell everybody no matter who
Spread the word, by the chitter chat
And go like this, and kinda go like that
It's taking place inside and outside
In your house, in your ride
Gotta get it, get it right
And that's the way it went
It's only evident
And the music's been sent
To move your ligament
Show you down to us
C'mon baby shake that thang
We ain't tryin' to hold nobody back

Tell your mama come
Tell your papa come
Tell your brother come
Tell your sister come
Tell your cousin come
Tell your homie come
Cuz y'all can come along
Nigga come along

Tell your mama come
Tell your papa come
Tell your brother come
Tell your sister come
Tell your cousin come
Tell your homie come
Cuz they can come along
Really y'all can come along

(Apl De Ap)
This is an invitation
So gather up your crew
We goin' on a mission
Provided by the who (who)
The three amigos
Doin' our way like Carlitto's
I'm seein' Señoritas
Send some me the Señoritos
So grab her by the hand
And make her feel the jam
It's like a salsa dance
Hotter than some desert sands
So baby sway
Dilate me like my people
Come and unify
The reason this we are equal
And if you're feelin' down
We're here to pick you up
You can shake it off
Baby just tell me what's up
Let me help you out
Or you can turn your back
We don't wanna hold nobody back

Tell your mama come
Tell your papa come
Tell your brother come
Tell your sister come
Tell your cousin come
Tell your homie come
Cuz they can come along
Hey y'all can come along

Tell your mama come
Tell your papa come
Tell your brother come
Tell your sister come
Tell your cousin come
Tell your homie come
Cuz they can come along
All of y'all can come along

And join in the fun
Come along and join in the fun
Come along and join in the fun
Come along c' c'
We gonna be
Dancin', dancin', dancin', dancin'
Dancin', dancin', dancin', dancin'
Dancin', dancin', dancin', dancin'
Dancin', dancin', dancin', dancin'

(Speaking in Spanish)

(Will)
Yo, my man Taboo
Look they don't understand
Why don't you flip it up
And switch it back to English man

(Taboo)
Well come all of y'all
To our festival
The emotion is
Like a carnival
Music all the around
The world is gettin' down
Everyone's aight
And they dig the sound
So my chicharon in saturated fat
We ain't tryin' to hold nobody back

Tell your mama come
Tell your papa come
Tell your brother come
Tell your sister come
Tell your cousin come
Tell your homie come
Cuz they can come along
All of y'all can come along
