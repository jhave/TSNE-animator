[Mr. Shadow]
Introducin, seducing your mind, makin the one they call Stallon
To Shadow the one man batallon, retaliate never hesitate
To break a home, cause it's either you or him
With a hole inside your dome, I am known
To be the pain inflicter, 380 chrome in your mouth get the picture
I hitcha like Chavez, the job is well done when I am through
Whatcha even be thinking about stepping to this bald headed fool
On a mission, 36 1 9 up on the map,
Blowin up like oklahoma, like McVeigh I will attack
Fools collaps like the wall of berlin, when I enter
Down to the end of my days I represent the southern california,
Home of real soldiers, warriors down for the broads and not the corninor
Waiting for the call, I be the one makin the throw,
I be ready to blast in the party,
not the one to pass, now who's the badest thug of all

[Chorus](2x)
Now everybody in the hood throw your hands up in the sky
Represent where you from cause Deigo til I die
It is I Mr. Shadow on the rise with this gansta hit I don't plan to quit
Til I come apon a grip [repeat]

[Mr. Shadow]
When I flow this time leavin fools with multiple scraloses
Shadow is on the mic 619 until my coffen closes
I am ready to lyricly abuse plus confuse people
Like abuse no excuse, I'm devoted to my crime
With a bullet every time I bust a rhyme
Fool you got to hold your own in this city I reside
Throw them hands up in the sky represent where you from
Bop your head to beat move your feet to the drum
Here I come ready to take on any battle,
I'll show you that I rock from San Deigo to Seattle
I'll do you like a rattle, can you handle all this drama
Now I'm in your ghetto, I'm the rapping Jeffery Dahma
I'ma give it to you raw, cause this Shadow so Notorious
Every battle that I'm in I'm Victorious, to the point of no return
I'm unloading lyrics like a clip, down to spit like a cobra
So look over your shoulder

Chorus

[Mr. Shadow]
As I bust through the door and I drop another flow
Third Verse now in progress, convicts meet the congress
Mobbin ready with the squad droppin massive bomb
Blowin up like land mines atomic like the dogg (roof, roof, roof)
So watch when I shoot, cause fools be getting kicked
With my lyrics like a bitch, When I look, look behind cha
Shadow be ready to blind ya, enemies better be ready
When ever they diss me, cause I find cha
And I'm down with the finest in the state,
And the woods is where I dwell, fools get your story straight
I'll be damned like Alexander, my furture Holy like Evander
And when I get up on the mic, it's so tight I get some more stylez
And prehaps I'm the one talking to the fool, talking to you
And I'm unloading the strap and cappin you
And you can't handle, when ever the gat is exploding
And bustin the cap, it's the Shadow with the sickness
Leaving you twisted like tornado, ain't no witnesses like Kato
Cause I'm fatal

Chorus 1
