[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Young money
PD, yeah, macka gon' her

[Lil Wayne]
I'm a Millionaire
I'm a Young Money Millie in aire, tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Threw the pencil and leak the sheet of the tablet in my mind
Cause I don't write shit cuz I ain't got time
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the all mighty dollar
And the all mighty power of that chit cha cha chopper
Sister, Brother, Son, Daughter, Father motha fuck a copper
Got the maserati dancin on the bridge pussy poppin
Tell the coppers...hahahaha you can't catch 'em, you can't stop 'em
I go by them goon rules if you can't beat 'em then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em then you drop 'em
You drop 'em cuz we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Yeah motherfucker ha

[Cory Gunz]
I'm Millie in here with them Young Money millionaires
Think you really pop a wheelie in air
Mac Millie..the Vanillie's in here.. I'm a rascal don't get whopped
I get brats who don't give top
I get tassel, pass you with a flow you could never put a brake on
And I break on anything a nigger take on
Feel the napalm from my trey arm, straight long, throw a nigger like I'm Akon
Cause I make cons where the base gone, get the base blown
Let the Pistons on that chopper come on cops I'm kamikaze drop a rock with them Obamas
Illie in the mind, really with the nine, millie when I rhyme, silly anytime
Fine, chilly gitty on the grind, Shitty on a dime, Penny on the line
Plentys in me, any guinea's with 'em bigger than a mini and remind I'm
Illie and its all off G piece and a PG walk by beep beep
With a freak, skeet, Hawk Out, big feet on a jeep..
She caught by Weezy F, we be the best
Truely to death prove me the rest
Groupies confess, you be the ref, excuse me I left..Ha

[Lil Wayne]
A millionaire I'm a young money millionaire
What chyall really want it now
Y'all don't really wanna do it
If hip hop is dead I am the embalming fluid
And I don't care who it be, I'm steppin to it
Notice I say it cause to me, it ain't shit
Get it.
Call me whacha like trick?
Call me on my sidekick
Never answer when it's private
Man I hate a shy chick
Don't you hate a shy chick
I had a plate of shy chick and she ain't shy no mo'
She changed her name to my chick
Hahaha, yeah boy that's my girl
And she pops excellent up in Wayne's world
Totally dude you should
See their faces when they see that
This robot can move
And its like...
Hahaha, yea

[Lil Wayne] + [Cory Gunz]
I'm a millionaire I'm a
Young money cash money fast money
Slow money mo' money neva low money
What is that, who is that, I never heard of it
I will take your picture and make a rest in peace' shirt of it
Tell those niggers beating to make a rest in peace shirt of me cuz
I killed and now don't tell no one you heard of me
It's like, the beat was screamin, murder me
And I'm a, murderer
So I murdered it
And you niggers is what I eating I'll make sure of it
And he who don't believe me I'll make dessert of him
Sherbet him, I mean
Shame on him, or her
Carter, Father of
This rap thang, this is my race
Gon' take a lap man weezy baby's nursery
Now gon' take a nap man, it's nap time
I'll holla back at you at snack time
Weezy... F.... yea, ok
They say I'm rappin like Big, Jay, and Tupac
Andre 3 Thousand where is Erykah Badu at
Who that
who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne
My name ain't bic, but I keep that flame
Who that one
that do that boy
Y'all knew dat
True that swallow
And I be the shhhh
Now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I'd like for you to pay me by the hour
Hahaha
And I'd rather be pushing flowers
Than to be in the penn sharing showers
See Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in the garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr.Carter or Mr.Lawn Mower
Boy I got so many girls like I'm Michael Lowry
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Man, life, just ain't life, without me
Hip hop just ain't hip hop, without me
Young moola baby</pre>
