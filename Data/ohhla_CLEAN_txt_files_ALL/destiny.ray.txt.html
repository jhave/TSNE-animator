Typed by: bayluv@tupac.com

Lord, what's my destiny?
Can you help me?
And tell me: will my ambition take me there?

Anything you want
Everything you need
I can give it to you
If you listen to me
Anything you wish 
I can grant to be
Come and follow with me
This is your destiny

What do you dream when you asleep at night?

What do you dream when you asleep at night?
(I'm high as a kite)
Wonder why the money's tight and why we bust and fight
I been there, so I know it's rough when you wanna change your life
And no matter what you do, seem like it's never right
Born with a mission, and a heart full of ambition
But it's hard to be all you can be when don't nobody listen
(Daydreamin) Stay schemin and future-wishin
Never got attention till I got my first school suspension
Fool, what's the difference, we all got a path to follow
Pleasure or sorrow, you get another chance tomorrow
Even through struggle, beg, borrow, work or hustle
(Tragedy and trouble) Strive until you rise up out the rubble
(Don't wanna fumble) And you won't if you play it real
The best of me is my destiny when it's fulfilled
And if I fail, will I have the guts to try again
(To make it out before I die in sin) And even then

Anything you want
Everything you need
I can give it to you
If you listen to me
Anything you wish 
I can grant to be
Come and follow with me
This is your destiny

If a genie gave you 3 wishes, what would they be?

If a genie gave you 3 wishes, what would they be?
(Health, happiness and money - just for me)?
Or would you wish we'd put the guns down, world peace
Let the blind see and all the starvin people eat
But in reality we faced with greed (and competition)
I do my best to lace my seed, hopin he listen
Jealousy will make you fake friends
Set you up for the wet-you-up
Cause they don't wanna let you up
(Keep a watchful eye for shady Judas)
And home intruders with Mac-11s and Rugers
Ski mask, ready to do ya
As he get older, ambition grows inside a soldier
Chasin narcs on the block with a mouth full of boulders
And though the rollers wanna pull me over (I stay hopin)
With the world on my broad shoulders, hard to be social
Feel peace when releasin ambition through beats and vocals
If they try to bring you down, go local

Anything you want
Everything you need
I can give it to you
If you listen to me
Anything you wish 
I can grant to be
Come and follow with me
This is your destiny

If I ever make it to the top...

If I ever make it to the top (then I'll be free)
But if I fall back, tell me, would you remember me?
Or would you ridicule and laugh at Ray and spread rumors
It consumes ya, hate-filled wishes growin like tumors
Stay focussed like my ballin g's, destiny callin me to take it
Oughta be in college, but gambled, think I can make it
Can't be mistakin, no hesitatin, I'm tired of waitin
My frustration growin worse like my situation
(So what you sayin?)
&gt;From this cold-blooded state I'm raised in
Radio stations best get ready for the invasion
Throughout persuasion we touch millions across the nation
And show no fear when we battle the beast we facin
(No limitations) I knock the world up off its axis
Rough as a cactus, we bouncin back like a matress
The fact is, we all on this planet just tryina make it
And leave somethin for future generations

And so we stand

Anything you want
Everything you need
I can give it to you
If you listen to me
Anything you wish 
I can grant to be
Come and follow with me
This is your destiny

What do you dream when you asleep at night?

If a genie gave you 3 wishes, what would they be?

If I ever make it to the top, then I'll be free</pre>
