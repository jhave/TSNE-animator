If you still love this game make some noise

They're playing basketball
We love that basketball 
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball 
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball 
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball 
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball 
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball 

Basketball is my favorite sport
I like the way they dribble up and down the court
Some ball players like the microphone
Charles Oakley and Charles Barkley like to break bones
Ron Mercer like to slam dunk straight to the hoop
Derek Ander' love the alley oop
Allen Iverson like the pick and roll
But me myself, I like the give and go

They're playing basketball
We love that basketball 
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball 

Kevin Garnett jump out this world
Some say Sam Cassell look like Earl The Pearl
McGrady, Vince Carter are the very best
But Jason Williams, Ricky Davis don't take no mess
See basketball has always been my thing
I like Kobe, Dennis Rodman and the three point kings
And number 34, the man of the hour
Shaquille O'Neal got the money and the power

They're playing basketball
We love that basketball 
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball 

Patrick Ewing, Spreewell on the same team
And Scottie Pippen's rolling with the dream
Stoudamire meets Mark Berry
And what about Gary Payton, now that's scary
Jalen Rose rolling with Reggie Miller
Malone and Stockton, two thrillers
Alonzo Mourning, some say he mean
But Tim Hardaway crossover be green

*Chorus till end*</pre>
