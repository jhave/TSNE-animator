[Mack 10]
I'm screamin as I'm dreamin, I see evil bad spirits
So I wake up in the middle of the night to write lyrics
In a cold sweat, heard magnums in my dreams, my ears ring
So this time on the mic I bring horror like Stephen King
All my good times are turned bad like the Evan's
Seen hundreds get wounded but like a thousand 187's
Everybody that was so real, they were now phony
And the nigga that used to be my homie, shit he turned on me
I got a 45 that spit hot lead that'll drill him
The nigga know too much about me, so it's a must that I kill him
If it's time available at the shrink, man I need to spend it
Cuz now I see the chair rockin, but ain't nobody in it
I'm psycho like Norman Bates in the fresh side of my mind and
All I think about is comittin redrums like The Shining
So Lord please help me and forgive me for my sins
And tell me, why do I deserve the twilight zone that I'm in?
Somebody ease the pain I need a shot of novacaine
Or angel dust smoke circulatin through my brain
So who got the slaughter water, la la the brain killer
I got five on it, four stick, to the first dealer
With no screws left it's like my head is now hollow
I'm so crazy seems like my own shadow's scared to follow
Ain't that a bitch, 1-O caught up in the horror show
But ain't no popcorn or bon bons, it's all teflons nigga

[Hook:] X 2
I keep a 44 everywhere I go
It's 1-O in the ghetto horror show

[Jayo Felony]
I'm slangin ?nocous? on the boulders
Keys, O-Z's and quarters
Come along, get up, stand up, and come and get your sack
I'm bustin nigga's hearts with this motherfuckin crack
I'm sayin please oh please oh please give me just one more hit
Now I'm surrounded by skinny motherfuckers with glass dicks
I'll jack Jack and Jill, smack Bill Clinton and his bitch
Tell po po they can't fade me I'll kill him and his snitch
I'm a bad influence, I'm a bad influence
And motherfuckers don't wanna know what I'll tell these fuckin kids
Fuck school nigga, bang with me
Why you gotta get a job nigga, slang with me
Listen, my 44 protects ya if any nigga tries to test ya
Nigga who the fuck is you? I'm Peer Pressure
Took the last bit of the thorazine, I'm at the end of the rainbow
There ain't no fuckin pot of gold, just the ghetto horror show
There we go

[Hook:] X 2
I keep a AK everywhere I go
It's Jayo in the ghetto horror show
 
[Ice Cube]
I got to testify, I grew up in this ghetto horror
?Justaora? got me spittin from the ghetto Torah
Ghetto bible survival I'm hittin rivals in their vitals
Tryin to rob titles, from livin idols
I give recitals on the drugs to sex to county checks to Lex
Your respect from the hot techs
And it's the same for me cuz the fame don't wipe away the black
Westside can't react
Braniac with this maniac, get to losin 'fore the schools get to oozin
And your bitch get to ?twosin?
The niggas at 600 pools and like the Pope
Get on the fuckin city F niggas like to vote
It's the horror, no tomorrow in your eyes
But look at me nigga I believe I can fly
You believe you can die, well shit it might happen
I believe I can rhyme and look, I start rappin nigga

[Hook:] X 2
I keep a tech nine everywhere I go
It's Ice Cube in the ghetto horror show

[Mack 10 talking]
