Yeah that's right
this cut goes out to all y'all that's been missin us for mad years
One love y'all
Yeah that's right, He Got Game
PE 1998

[Chuck D]
If man is the father, the son is the center of the earth
In the middle of the universe, then why
is this verse comin six times rehearsed?
Don't freestyle much but I write em like such (Word)
Amongst the fiends controlled by the screens
What does it all mean all this shit I'm seein?
Human beings screaming vocal javelins
Sign of the local nigga unravelling
My wanderin got my ass wondering
where Christ is in all this crisis
Hating Satan never knew what nice is
Check the papers while I bet on ices
More than your eye can see and ears can hear
Year by year all the sense disappears
Nonsense perserveres, prayers laced with fear
Beware, two triple O is near

	[Chorus - both]
	It might feel good
	It might sound a little somethin
	but damn the game if it don't mean nuttin
	What is game? Who is game?
	Where's the game in life behind the game behind the game
	I got game, she's got game
	We got game, they got game, he got game
	It might feel good
	It might sound a little somethin
	but fuck the game if it ain't sayin nuttin

[Chuck D]
Damn, was it something I said?
Pretend you don't see so you turn your head
Ray scared of his shadow, does it matter?
For the reparations got him playin with the population
Nothin to lose, everything's approved
People used, even murders excused (You preach to em yo)
White men in suits don't have to jump
Still a thousand and one ways to lose with his shoes
God takes care of old folks and fools
while the devil takes care of makin all the rules
Folks don't even own themselves
payin mental rent, to corporate presidents (My man my man)
Ugh, one outta million residents
bein dissident, who ain't kissin it
The politics of chains and whips
Got the sickness and chips and all the championships
What's Love Got To Do with what you got
Don't let the weight get to your head or lost to your heart (Word)
Nonsense perserveres, prayers laced with fear
Beware, two triple O is near

Chorus

[Flavor Flav]
Yeah that's right
Everybody got game
But we just here to let y'all know
that PE, is in full effect, from right now till the year 2000
Aiyo my man sing it

[Stephen Stills]
There's something happening here (Yeah yeah)
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man, with a gun over there (Yeah that's right hah haha)
tellin me, I got to beware
It's time we stop, children what's that sound?
Everybody look what's goin, down
(Aiyo, I don't think they heard you Stevie
Kick it to em again one more time)
It's time we stop, children what's that sound?
Everybody look what's goin, down

[Flavor Flav]
Haha, that's right boy, PE in full effect boy to the year 2000 yo

	[Shabach Community Choir of Long Island]
	Stop, look, what's that sound
	Everybody knows what's goin down
	*repeat to fade*

[Flavor Flav - over top of choir]
Come on sing it
Sing it again y'all come on
Hey!
He-hey!!!
Aiyo, these are some serious times that we're livin in G
And a new world order is about to begin, y'knowhutI'msayin?
Now the question is - are you ready, for the real revolution
which is the evolution of the mind?
If you seek then you shall find that we all come from the divine
You dig what I'm sayin?
Now if you take heed to the words of wisdom
that are written on the walls of life
then universally, we will stand and divided we will fall
because love conquers all, you understand what I'm sayin?
This is a call to all you sleepin souls
Wake up and take control of your own cipher
And be on the lookout for the spirit snipers
tryin to steal your light, y'knowhutI'msayin?
Look within-side yourself, for peace
Give thanks, live life and release
You dig me? You got me?</pre>
