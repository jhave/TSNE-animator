Speaking [CL Smooth]:
Yeah, CL Smooth, DJ JS-One
Sadat X, there's nuthin' anyone can say
Here we go
Yes, yes, uh, uh

Sample: There's nothing anyone can say (X3)

Verse One (CL Smooth):
I bring a lean with it, toss a little green with it
Heavy on my team with it, bust up on the scene with it
There's nothing you can say, we be sipping rose
You can quote the whole game but son +I Did It My Way+
So clean and proper, that black Sinatra
Another showstopper, we let it loose mama
In the club with it, circle all the love with it
Meet me on the dance-floor, what you think we here for?
I'm so excellent, you're looking at the president
You youngins tried to dumb it out but I was more intelligent
And so Hip Hop, and so mainstream
We talking new cream, you on the wrong team
We do it all day, castle to the hallway
I came from the bottom up, there's nuthin' you can say

[Chorus X3: Samples]
"Nuthin' anyone can say"
"Somebody say, say nothin'"- KRS-One

Verse two (Brother Ali):
What do you say to a man who been to hell and back
Escaped out of Satans hands with his head in tact
Made his own plans when there was no welcome mat?
Dog Ill tell you what you tell him
You dont tell him jack
Since you fine time rappers I hurt you motherfuckers 
I beddie ? tuck you under covers
I already outlast half of these youngstas
Chill catch your breath
Ain't nuthin' you should mumble
Still nuthin' come from bumpin' your gums
Baby I come where you from
Get the hum buggin' begun
I was raised on that +Mecca+ and that +All For One+
I've been training for the record since the story was spun
Can run from the culture
Either kill or be killed
Now let your little bad breath will be still
Say nuthin'

Chorus [X3]

Speaking [Brother Ali]:
Ah, yes y'all. You are now rockin' with the best of the best y'all. 
JS-1 is on the wheels of steel. 
This is Brother Ali and we in here tonight. 
The great CL Smooth and Sadat X. 
Ha, I snuck my way on this track right here. 
Sadat what up?

Speaking [Sadat X]:
Yeah that's right, Sadat X
CL and JS

Verse Three [Sadat X]:
There's nuthin' you can say about X
Sadat X the great, the godfather
See him up on Broadway with the O'Jays chilling
I might not had a top billing, but I'm straight
I'm cool for travel, the passport is a pass cause
There's nuthin' anyone can say
You want to go to gunplay, I don't think you want that
We keep the burners but we don't flaunt that
For eight months I was laid up in the New York jail
Only contact by the phone or the mail
They didn't give a nigga bail but I handled it
Came home, ate dinner with my baby, it was candle lit
No parole, Sadat stay ready to roll
JS, hit these niggas with that soul
I'm never too old, I won't stop till I pop
Can't we get past this radio slop?

[Chorus X4]</pre>
