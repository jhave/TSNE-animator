Song:   Soothing
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, don't this sound so soothing
If them hoes choosing they losing
Yeah, and don't this sound extra soothing
If them girls ain't choosing they losing
Yeah, and don't this sound so soothing
If them hoes choosing they losing
Yeah

[Verse 1]
No record deal
I'm fresh as hell
New car paid for
They catchin hell
When I pull up
With all they hoes
Foggy as fuck
All that smoke
I'm Huey Newton
Black dynamite
Fuck these hoes
With all my might
Heads or tails
To each his own
I call it Mona Lisa
Cause I make Lisa moan
And anytime you ain't smokin' you should be
Call of Duty, Battlefield thats how my hood be
Yeah, a little bit of this
A little bit of that
Kill em with the flow
Kill em with the mac
Now you did
And I got yo bitch
I [?] in your grave
Piss on that bitch
Me and her just met
Now we goin in
She chose me
Now she gon' win

[Chorus]
Yeah, and don't this sound so soothing
If girls ain't choosing they losing
Yeah, and don't this sound extra soothing
If them bitches ain't choosing they losing
Yeah, and don't this sound so soothing
If them girls ain't choosing they losing
Yeah, and don't this sound so soothing

[Verse 2]
I'm extra fresh
You know I is
Whats this song called
I have no idea
Its fresh doe
So is this club
Lets have a drink
Lets make love
Back at my place
I just bought you ace
Thats more than your rent
Gimme some face
These random thoughts
Don't mean no harm
I'm tryna get in your car
Hit the alarm
Permission to enter
That velvet center
Don't need no pictures just to make this a night to remember
You niggas is hoes
Transvestite
I'm so bored can some of yall girls please excite
Roll that weed ignite
Sit back and chill
Look what time it is
Time to get real
You know wassup
Fuckin' games
Its three in the morning I'm supposed to hittin' that shit like whats my name
Bitch quit playin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, and don't this sound so soothing
If them girls ain't choosing they losing
Yeah, and don't this sound so soothing
If them girls ain't choosing they losing
Yeah, and don't this sound so soothing
If them girls ain't choosing they losing
Yeah, don't this sound so soothing</pre>
