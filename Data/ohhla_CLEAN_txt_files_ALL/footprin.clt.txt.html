[Bugzy Bogart]
Lord you said once I decided to follow you you would walk with me all the way
But I have noticed that durin' the most troublesome times of my life
There is only one set of footprints I don't understand why
when I needed you most You would leave me

Dear God
Can I have a minute?
Why'd you make such a beautiful place?
Fill it with hate then sprinkle AIDS in it?
You take the lives of innocent kids like they did it?
The same minute one's born another one's gone
You blamin' the people cuz we slaughtered your offspring
He died and you tried to pass him off as an offerin'
There's some who don't believe you they read through
The first part of the bible don't believe in the sequel
Or speak Hebrew to try to please you
Why give us free will and then incarcerate us if we choose evil?
We call evil illegal here disciples are priests
But it's bleak because for real priests are just people
Little boy confided in 'em priest slides it in 'em
No disciplinary action 'cuz police try to get him to testify
But he's too embarrassed and the parents
Agree to keep it quiet they take money from the parish
Now he won't say shit so the pastor's not banished
Simply relocated and the case could just vanish
Why place spanish and blacks back in the hood where the good die young
Because on every corner there's a spot you could buy guns
The streets flooded with diseases people sleep on the concrete bloody from needles
Babies malnourished Mommy no money to feed you
But keep praying baby girl don't worry he sees you

[Chorus: Yendi]
Every time I see you walk - then I believe
You talk  then I believe
You prove it - and I'll believe
Improve - and I'll believe
You move - and I'll believe
You show me - I'll believe
You know me - I believe
Every time I see you
I always believe in you
Don't know why you got me suffering
I don't know what to do
Why don't you show me the way
So I can believe in you
I can't go on feeling like this today
So why don't you show me the way?
Just show me the way

[Bugzy Bogart]
I gave you the world and you killed my son
You question me curse me and you're still not done
You pray let me survive this Lord and I promise, Lord
That for the rest of my life I'll live honest Lord
You live by the sword and then cry
When somebody that you love dies by the sword
Shit I did it to the dinosaurs
So don't think for a minute that you'd win and could survive this war
You should've took Bin Laden as a warning
Cuz ya'll are just characters the earth a cartoon that I'm drawin'
And don't come cry to me
Cuz your quality of life doesn't have nothing to do with equality
Homelessness and poverty?
It's not my fault you can't divide properly there's plenty of property
59 billion acres of land for six billion people
That's nearly ten acres for each man
That's why I extended the waters to reach land
So each man could carry his weight with each hand
You can't always win sometimes you gotta fail
Cuz success can't teach the lessons defeat can
If I offered a cure for AIDS Y'all would blame me
For all the jobs lost and it would all be my fault the same
But what about 9-11? 2,800 died but 47,000 more survived
Now let me ask you a question if the world is so bad
Then why do people get sad and mourn and cry
When people that they love die?
Shouldn't they be happy? or jealous even??
Oh you'll miss 'em??? so then it's selfish reasons
Men started up this cycle of sin
You want answers? you better breeze through the bible again
I'm a leave you with this I gave Adam and Eve Eden
There's people that's not believing that I even exist

[Chorus: Yendi]
Every time I see you walk - then I believe
You talk  then I believe
You prove it - and I'll believe
Improve - and I'll believe
You move - and I'll believe
You show me - I'll believe
You know me - I believe
Every time I see you
I always believe in you
Bugzy Bogart:
My son I love you and would never leave you
During your times of trial and suffering
When you see only one set of footprints
It was then that I carried you
