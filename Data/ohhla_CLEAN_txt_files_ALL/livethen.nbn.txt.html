(Treach)
One steps down the path of poverty most know the route
not a pot to piss in or a door to throw it out
All I hear, these days, we say, she say, we say, anyway
He grows, she grows, we grow, listen negro (listen)
I die, you die, few die, who rob, its do or die
You fry, I fry, new play, new day, new God
Tell me, what's the sense of this?
Tell me before they gotta jail me and mail me
Had to mention it
You've never been to the ghetto till you had to enter this
Some plans, one chance, hold heat, hold head, hold theirs (hold ya head)
Peep rules, we proof, meet troops, speak truth, teach youth (teach the youth)
No crews, who's who? New day, new rules, do you:
Break bread, wake heads, check heads, half-a-head for steak feds? (check 'em)
They'll lock your body, even gotti
Grab your shotties for an illuminati (ready)
They'll lock your body as gotti
Grab your shotties it's an illuminati

(Chorus: Phiness)
Open your eyes up, people can't you see?
It's gettin' harder by the day for you and me
All my life I've seen so much misery
Can there be a better place for you and me?

(VinRock)
Why, everytime you try to show a nigga love they shit on you?
Fuck I'm suppose to do?
Why, everytime a brother comin' up some pray ya through?
That's what success'll do
Cause I'm a hard workin' black man
In my face stab in my back man
Rob and steal they wanna kill me black man
Tell me now what the deal is black man
Don't ya know the powers in our hand?
Cause we shine we end up six feet inland
When we could build one nation
And it's comprised of all persuasion
African, Latin caught cagin', Asian
New World Order, Hip-Hop Nation
Then we can turn hate to love
like Malcolm and Martin tripped up, open up your eyes

(Chorus: Phiness)
Open your eyes up, people can't you see?
It's gettin' harder by the day for you and me
All my life I've seen so much misery
Can there be a better place for you and me?

(Phiness)
Here today, gone tomorrow
Live then lay, here tomorrow

(Treach)
Tell me, what's the sense of this?
Tell me before they gotta jail me and mail me
Had to mention it
You've never been to the ghetto till you had to enter this
What's the sense of this?
Tell me before they gotta jail me and mail me
Had to mention it
You've never been to the ghetto till you had to enter this

(Chorus: Phiness)
Open your eyes up, people can't you see?
It's gettin' harder by the day for you and me
All my life I've seen so much misery
Can there be a better place for you and me?

(Treach)
Feel me, the end of the century
Feel me, they want us in wakes and penitentiaries (open your eyes)
That's how the envy be
Now they got it, we our own enemies
Feel me, the end of the century
Feel me, they want us in wakes and penitentiaries (open your eyes)
That's how the envy be
Now they got us, we our own enemies</pre>
