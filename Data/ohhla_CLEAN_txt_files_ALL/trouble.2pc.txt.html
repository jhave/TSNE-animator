Born to wreck shit, poppin bubble gum
Others call me up, but momma call me troublesome
Learned to shoot a gun, before I learned to read or write
Never touched a pipe, made my money every night
Till I gotta (ride), a motherfuckin Benz
Bitch talked to every snitch, they jeapordized me gettin rich
Only fifteen at a spot full of rock teens
Full of hard knocks, ready to clock, FUCK the cops (yeah!)
And we was fat like Trump
Every nigga packed a pump, so time to be poppin trunks
I stood at the top of the organization
Ready to pop a cop with no hesitations (fuck the police) yeah
Now I'm makin all the others run
Cause here it comes, look out for brother troublesome

Yeah y'all, hehe
A nigga named Troublesome

I learned from my mistakes I'm twenty-one now
I gotta pack of jackers out for me they hold a gun battle
Ain't old enough to save but I behave just like a true vet
That's cause for all the dirt I did and dirt I didn't do yet
Tryin to pop my pistol for a profit
Copper tried to stop I didn't drop and so he got it (yeah)
And I don't give a fuck about it
(Aiyyo you think you'll ever quit this shit?)  I doubt it
So why not take all of me
Cause I just love to be the nigga that nobody else has the balls to be
These suckers always searchin for me, with funk
They in a hurry to get buried with they locs up
And once I let my gun pop
Another motherfucker drops
I smoke a gang of buddha better yet some indo
Crack through your window, nigga where the fuck the ya-yo?
You tried to hesitate I couldn't wait to rush him
I didn't trust him, he sneezed and I had to bust him
I'm criminal I'm workin doin wicked shit
So catch a Christmas cause I'm murderin your witnesses, I'm troublesome

Yeah!
Yeah, a nigga named Troublesome

Now I'm on top got plenty open
I ain't no fuckin joke so you can label me King of Oakland, huh
As I sit back and rake my, dough in
I let my money grown in just got rich off what they owin, huh
And flippin hoes, there's no open
Keepin a sister broke I'd rather take it from the token (give it up)
A psychopath when provoked then
all you see is smoke I pull a pistol from my, coat
I told you we ain't havin it (c'mere)
Give up the dough, reached for his coat, started grabbin it
Bang bang!  Was the sound as I jetted
A bullet in the head so the sucker don't forget it
But I knew that I'd be dead soon
Crime in my head, makin decisions in my bedroom
I see task at my front do' (ahh shit)
But I ain't goin alive, so what the fuck these niggaz come fo'
Just because you got a vest don't mean you escape from death (bitch)
I put this AK to your chest it'll take your entire breath
Threw a grenade in the front yard
Six cops lunged then got crunched, here they come God
The other cops are closin in
Deja vu, what do I do, here we go again (here we go again)
I'd rather take my life than have these suckers clown me
When they found me, they call me troublesome

Troublesome, word up
Uptown, they got a Troublesome
In Crooklyn, they got a Troublesome
In the Bronx, they got a Troublesome
In Uptown, they got a Troublesome
South South Bronx, they got a Troublesome
The jungle, they got a Troublesome
Washington D.C. troublesome
Baltimore (troublesome) Miami
Troublesome, Seattle
All over this motherfuckin country (troublesome)
in every single ghetto (troublesome)
As long as there ain't money there's gonna be troublesome
Troublesome, word up
Troublesome
Troublesome, troublesome
Troublesome
