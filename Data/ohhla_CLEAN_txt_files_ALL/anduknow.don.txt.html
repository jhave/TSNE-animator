[Redman]
Yo, Yo, Yo, Funk Doc up in here
Yo, yo, yo, you just fucked up and let Brick City up in this motherfucker, right?
Ay, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
D-Don is in the house, yo
Rahiem is in the house, yo
Suga Bear is in the house, yo
Redman is in the house, D-Don

[D. Don]
I swing like Tarzan, from tree to tree
Through the jungle, the ghetto, street's a part of me (*monkey noises*)
We rollin' OZ, pushin' Ranges through Hollywood
Me lookout from the ?Luniz?
TV dial, jew-well dot wild
Platinum hits and styles is what we all about this..
Raise G-thing that we bring..
We all got big balls and we, all do our thing it's
C.O.D. Cash On Delivery
Ya'll paid to get in, but now the party belong to me!
The pussy ain't never free
My crew stay sucka free, sugar free, and they all better be!
Ready to fight like the Army
Even though we party, don't alarm me, cause I'm still very hungry
I need a "Killing Me Softly" with this one
I need to spend some more time with my daughter and my son

[Hook]
Somebody SAY
(And You Know That! And You Know That! And You Know That!)
If you see a fly nigga and you're ready to freak/free
All my bitches scream
(And You Know That!)
If you see a fly Benz and you're ready to freak/free
All my niggaz scream
If you see a fly nigga and you're ready to freak/free
All my bitches scream
(And You Know That!)

My lyrics still drop thick-a..
I knock you out like hard liquor
Cold like Jack Frost shi-va..
I "Cock-A-Doodle-Doo" early like roost-a
Make you party all night even though, you're not used ta..
I'm ?Da-Don-Da? I give a champange toast
To all the real haters that hated the most, nah..
Jails can't keep me, I'm back completely
And Mama, I know you're wit me...
And Dada, I know you never knew..
All the things I've been goin' through, takin' after YOU
But still I make the people dance
Like B.I.G., give me "One More Chance"...
Romance, without finance
It's a new ?santch?
You better of, tryna pay yo debts off of food stamps, right?
?Da-Don-Da? tell 'em, "Please, Please, Please"
Simon says, "Take four steps back and FREEZE!"

All my niggaz scream
If you see a fly nigga and you're ready to freak/free

(And You Know That!)

Come out, come out, whereever you are
Tonight is your night, I make you feel like a star!
And none can test it, even a-bulletproof-vest it
HEAR THIS, and get injected
I got thug love, for any thug
That give me love, and real love, for any love
So give me love, and I just won't quit
The ill, legit, ?da mit?, call me quick and I won't slip
The realest, the illest, I'll make 'em feel this
I'm Big Ben like Rolex, shiny like Richie Rich
I'm coast-to-coast to cross Canadian boarder
Cruise like Battleships, takin' over like water
D-Don got you touch like Midas, and I might just
Marry the flyest mistress in a finite...

(And You Know That! And You Know That! And You Know That!)
If you see a fly nigga....If you see a fly bitch...
If you see a fly NIGGA....If you see a fly BITCH....C'mon
[Redman - with "And You Know That" in background]
Yo, yo, yo, nah, nah, chill, chill, this is Funk Doc, Brick City style
Yo, yo, yo we holdin' it down, (Somebody SAY...)
?Big Pee-Pee? style, Def Squad style, forever, baby
