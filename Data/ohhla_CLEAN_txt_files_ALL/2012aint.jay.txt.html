Oh oh
2-0-1-2
Oh-yeah
It's alright, Oh It's alright
You know what they say
Life ain't always easy everyday
we're survivors
So forget the day
It's all about tonight act a fool
and start a riot, a riot be rebel
Bottles poppin 'til we can't stand
We keep it rocking 'til 6 am
New York to London over to Japan

Turn it up .. Turn It Up.. Mash it up
We gonna party like
Party like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like, like it's 2012
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up.. Turn it up .. Mash it up
It ain't the end of the world
Oh
Gonna live like it's the end of the world
Gonna party like
Oh
Turn it up... Turn it up... Mash it up
It ain't the end of the world

[Nicki Minaj]
Simile's, metaphors and we pop pills
sick flow inundated with the doc bills
work hard, now we know how to top bills
in the middle of the street doing cartwheels
lot of them tryna do it but it's not real
wasn't a rapper then I could've got a pop deal
white clothes in a hot pink hot wheels
lot of bottles and a lot of booty cocktails
uh, days of our lives
you wink it goes by
so we'll just get it with no Edison
anything goes so no time for closed minds
and free my little weezy
and let's just get right
Young Money, Cash Money in the building
let's go the World ends tonight

[Jay Sean]
Have a drink with me
And let's make tonight go down
In history.. in history yeah
let's play make believe
It's the last 24 hours and this whole world is ours eternally, eternally

Hey
Bottles poppin til we can't stand
We keep it rocking til 6 am
New York to London over to Japan
Turn it up .. Turn It Up.. Mash it up
We gonna party like

Party like, like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like, like it's 2012
You Know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up.. Turn it up .. Mash it up

So let's start it with here right now

We gonna party like like it's 2012
You Know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
