Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
In the kitchen, oven open for the heat
Got my young, light skinned ho rollin' up the tree
Wearin' jackets in the house, it's the Michigan way
Boiling water on the stove, Ramen noodles for dinner
Dope fiends out the halfway house and they still sniffin'
Homie mommy's 50, smokin' and still trippin'
Still talkin' shit with this Lucio mask lickin'
See my breath when I talk, but nigga, I ain't trippin'
Landlord is, the nigga tryna put us out
Sellin' all the samples, can't afford to give 'em out
Just copped a half tre, see my nigga tryna get it
Standin' on the baseline, Scottie Pippen pivot
Needles in they arms just to keep the lights on
Shit, fuck around, be on hardcore pawn
Tryna get this shit off, the winter, we snuck in
Won't live for anything, but might die for nothin'

[Chorus: x2]
They want that old Danny Brown
To bag up and sell a whole pound
Might have to go and get my braids back
Matter of fact, go and bring them AKs back

[Verse 2]
In the Cutty same color as steak sauce
Eyeballed the work, but was just a.8 off
Vet in the game, first seed in the playoffs
Meet me at the Coney, gotta get this weight off
Balmains fittin' like a nigga went swimmin' in 'em
I'm waxed and I'm shinin', hardwood floor
Whore want it hardcore, squirt it on her jaw
Lookin' at the whore like "what you came here for?"
Linwood nigga, heat on him, no stash box
Turn a gangbanger's bandana to a rag top
Old head, dope fiend, cookin' up the yay
Young boys'll shoot your face for them Cartiers
Came a long way takin' $3 for a nick'
Cop an 8 ball, tryna stack for the zip
Now I'm in the rap game, verse worth a brick
Fiends linin' up for a hit of this shit
(And I reps that shit, right now and forever) [x2]

[Chorus]</pre>
