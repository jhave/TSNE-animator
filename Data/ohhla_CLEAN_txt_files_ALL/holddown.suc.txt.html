Screwed Up Click my nigga, H-Town's finest
You are now listening, to the incredible H-A-Dub-K
And I am Lil' O, the Fat Rat Wit Da Cheeze nigga
H-Town we got you baby, let's go

[H.A.W.K.]
Like crutches, on a broken leg
We, banded together like Jamaican dreads
And, both of us out here stacking our bread
And if we was locked up, you can share my spread
Right now, speaking to the dead
And all of my partnas, going stay up FED
I'm still out here, trying to get ahead
And help to build dreams, for the tears I shed
Now Fat Pat, your boy got your back
I put that on Pat, cause I promised him that
As a matter of fact, with this verbal attack
We'll shit on these cats, and grab a few platinum placks
Put your money, where your mouth is
I'm bout to show everybody, who the real King of the South is
Believe that, nigga I breathe that
You can go ask him, if you need some jack

[Lil' O]
Like a big, fo' pound
When these niggaz got plex, and the shit go down
Like a blunt, when you stretch they wanna get to' down
Like the heart of a champ, in the last fo' rounds nigga
Man, it is what it is
All my niggaz in the ground, you gon live when I live
All my niggaz in a cell, man your kids is my kids
A nigga burn you, then his ass getting hit for real nigga
Cause that's what I do
Everytime I wreck the mic, nigga that's for the Screw
Everytime I hit the dealership, it's last for the two
Me and my niggaz, back to back in them Coupes for real nigga
Nothing, coming between us
Me and you was tighter, than Serena and Venus
Whoever don't like you, he could suck on my penis
You got trouble, man I'm coming with Ninas nigga

(*talking*)
For real mayn, who else gon hold down the Southwest
South Park, 3rd Ward, Mo City, Hiram-Clarke
For real, Greenspoint, Acres Home, Studewood
The whole North mayn, for real West End the motherfucking 4
Screwed Up Click man, we gon hold you down mayn
You know we gon hold it down, for the motherfucking H mayn
All the real go-getters mayn, all the block bleeders mayn
All thye grinders mayn, this is Hustle City mayn
Home of the drank nigga, home of the work nigga
Home of the dank nigga, home of the Screw nigga for real
Well respected never neglected nigga, believe that
It's the motherfucking take over mayn
Motherfucking punks is playing, stop playing punks
Show these boys how to play, Lil' O said that nigga West up</pre>
