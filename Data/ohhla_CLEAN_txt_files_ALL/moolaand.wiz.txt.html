all about my chavo my guap keep keep it commin
who you foolin boy I does it your girl said she loves it
pocket full of guap and that moola keep it commin
heavy hustle, rostrum records on it big man its nothin
cigarillo full o dat rain man I call her fresh puffin

spit that thing in oven turn it up and make muffins
money commin up that moola and the green

I'm a star in the air, doin big things
why you think your lady stare I'm stuntin like a stunna do

money everywhere look dumbie right in front of you

I got what you need the feddy and the cheese
The moola and the guap

I got what you need the feddy and the cheese
The moola and the guap

Yeahhhh... I'm fresh up of the plane I hit the town straight from tourin
I don't run up and down the court but u can say I'm ballin
the moneys not a problem so you know they goin hate
when they see them yellow diamonds you should see them hoes face
imma need a whole case hit the club and pop them bottles
in it with my thugs spendin dubs like no tomorrow
I make a lot of chavo and meet a lot of bust downs
saw me in the club once shawty got a crush now
don't got the time got a line of sexy women
wanna fuck the team cuz they seen how we be spendin
rock expensive linen ya that baggy shit is finished
when you gettin money, everything is fitted
listen this is nothin close to most of you nigga's weirdo's
my swagga on one followed by a zero zero
I got up in her ear hole she hopped up in my seats
told her ride with a g if you like what you see

300 dolla jeans, tight white tee
I look at you and tell you to get right like me
and check your main broad because she might like me
