"The thugs is in the house, (we in duh house)
The thugs is in the house, (we turn it out)
The thugs is in the house, (we in duh house)
The thugs is in the house, (we turnin' this thing out)
Wanna see the thugs gone (see the thugs gone)
And wanna see the thugs gone (while my T-H-U-G music plays on, plays on)
It don't stop (it don't stop) while my thug music plays on
It won't stop, they wanna see the thugs gone (see the thugs gone)
They wanna see the thugs gone (while my T-H-U-G music plays on, plays on)
It won't stop, thug music plays on (plays on)
 
I wanna holla, I need to talk to the world
The system haters, even though sometimes we tend to do right
Well look at the news, previews of all of our troubles in life
If it ain't one thing, its another
They keep a composite of undercover
Really kind of disturbed us
They tryin to make people think that we bone thugs don't know what we do (cool)
We let 'em think that we playin the heat
And celebratin Eazy's victory, blowin my week
And well it ain't that easy, being Krayzie Bone
Temptations battlin' and persuations rattlin' my brain
Won't go insane i'm thinkin thats why they callin' me Krayzie 
cuz I still maintain (still maintain)
 
[Chorus: Krayzie]
The thugs is in the house, (we in duh house)
We can't be stopped, and we turn it out, (we turn it out)
The thugs is in the house, (we in duh house)
We can't be stopped, and we turn it out, (we turn it out)
 
[Layzie]
They probably thought that we would fall off
Be comin up missing in this rap game
After 30 million records and 7 years, ain't nothin' changed 
(ain't nothin changed) And everybody wanna be like the Bone
And you can put yer radio on without you hearin' our flows
Ten toasts, to the earth
Match for everyhting its worth, til im dead and in the dirt
I'll be up there puttin in work, until it hurt (until it hurt)
It be me and my niggas
Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, and Flesh, my niggas (Wish: my niggas)
We gon' ride for the niggas that didn't make it to see
The way we, do this here, Tomb Stone and Eazy E
While we ride, Niggas is probably thinkin' we nutz
Like this mission gonna self-destruct
Come again, you got us fucked up
I'm a thug by nature, gettin this paper be the reason
That these hustlers out of Cleveland
On the come up daily creepin
Nigga believe me, we in the house
And every time I puts it down, we turns it out
 
[Chorus: Krayzie]
The thugs is in the house, (we in duh house)
We can't be stopped, and we turn it out, (we turn it out)
The thugs is in the house, (we in duh house)
We can't be stopped, and we turn it out, (out out out)
 
[Wish]
You know and I know they thought it would take us no where
But look at 'em thugs now we on the top, we took it right there
Thugs got what you want (want), we came for the music
we can always pop that trunk, (pump)
Everywhere we go (go), and everywhere we be (be)
Everybody recognize that B-O-N-E, man
I ain't braggin'
Man, my life's a blessin'
Lord, please hear me now, don't take it away now I learned my lesson
You can stop the hatin', but that thugster music plays on (plays on)
You can count on Bone to come and rock it till we dead gone
I know we spit that shit, and some don't like it
But bone just keepin' it real
Wrong is wrong, right is right
 
[Krayzie]
The thugs is in the house, (we in duh house)
The thugs is in the house, (we turn it out)
The thugs is in the house, (we in duh house)
The thugs is in the house, (we turnin' this thing out)
Wanna see the thugs gone (see the thugs gone)
And wanna see the thugs gone (while my T-H-U-G music plays on)
It don't stop (it don't stop) while my thug music plays on
It won't stop, they wanna see the thugs gone (see the thugs gone)
They wanna see the thugs gone (while my T-H-U-G music plays on)
It won't stop, thug music plays on
The thugs is in the house, (we in duh house)
The thugs is in the house, (we turn it out)
The thugs is in the house, (we in duh house)
The thugs is in the house, (we turnin' this thing out)
