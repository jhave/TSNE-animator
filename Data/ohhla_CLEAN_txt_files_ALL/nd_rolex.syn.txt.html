[Intro]
If you got the time, I got the time..

[Toddy Tee] 
Yo, what's up, man?

[Ice-T] 
Yo, what's happenin?

[Toddy Tee]
Man, I went to this party last week, man
This girl cold dissed me, man, cause I didn't have on no gold, man

[Ice-T]
Are you serious man?!
That's tough, tell me what happened

[Verse 1: Toddy Tee]
Went to a party, freaks on the wall
DJs and Emcees and everybody was havin' to ball
And as I walked through the party my mind flipped
I left my gold at home and I tripped
Goupies, skeezers, girls glore
Everybody was movin' the body on the dance floor
Looked on the stage, two guys there were rappin'
Gold around their neck, this DMC stuff is happenin'
Looked to my left, spotted a freak
I mean man.. she looked that good, that I was scared to speak
My homeboys, they begin to brag 
Put your money on the table, would you go for my drag?
I said: honey hi!, I wish I was you, so I can make love to me 
She said: you serious?
I said: yes, my name is T&amp;T,
She cold dissed me, wouldn't give me respect
No golds on my neck, I need a Rolex

[Hook: Mix Master Spade]
I need a rolex.. I need a rolex..
If you got the time, I got the time..

[Verse 2: Toddy Tee]
That's right, I said Rolex, you heard it my friend
What did it cost? ---&gt; King TEE
Put it like this, I could've bought a Benz 
But I said to myself, I need to look up class
I need somethin' that it stand out, somethin' that it last
So I went to Salavix, this saleslady: said what's up?
I said: yo, I need the whole damn hook up
18K, bought a watch and chain 
And a necklace with diamonds and grayed with my name
Now, I'm lookin' deaf, ultimately cool and in a <name> mall
I shopped at the <trademark> and bought me a bunch of dress codes
Gorche and Slacks, I won't wear a Vila, too many people wears that
Now, I'm drapped in my Alligator Shoes 
And that's a real, that if you touched them they'll bite you
It's '88, now, I'm rockin' the house
So clear the way to the stage, cause I'm steppin' out

[Hook: Mix Master Spade]
I need a rolex.. I need a rolex..
If you got the time, I got the time..

[Verse 3: Toddy Tee]
Now, I'm back at the party
A week later they let me through the doors
My Alligator Shoes, cause I screwed, the people drool 
And the guys in the back are sayin: You're so cool
Now, I'm standin' on stage, hands gripped on the mic
Rolex shinnin' and blindin' them in the light
And as I rocked them and begin to shout
Yo T man, you looked pimped out
So I said: yo thank you, my show is about to over
They said we want more, so I looked over my shoulder
And there she was starin' in my eyes 
Ms. material girl, was hypnotized 
By my jewelry, I couldn't understand
I knew right then, the Rolex was in command
She said: I love you with all respect
There's no gold on your neck, girl, you need a Rolex

[Hook: Mix Master Spade]
I need a rolex.. I need a rolex..
If you got the time, I got the time..</trademark></name></pre>
