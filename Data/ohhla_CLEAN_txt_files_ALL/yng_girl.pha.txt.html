(You know)
(you know listen to me)

Mama help I fell in love with a young girl

(thats true, so true)
(you're the only girl I love to)

My heart was soakin and I will be in a young world

(so true, so true, listen)

I wasn't tryin to lead her on
See I didn't wanna be alone
But when she smiles she braught me home
So I braught her home,
Its not that the fealin of love is gone
Cant expect a car little girl to be grown
I cant give a fuck what so and so says
Crushes hurt both ways

What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do

Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!

What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do

My heart was soakin and I will be in a young world!

What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young
Young girl, so in love with you

The single girls are out tonight
But you have one word, my heart, one life
And I'm not lookin around
So why you lookin down
(what you lookin down for?)

I fucked up a long time ago
See I should have never let you know
See I couldnt give a fuck what tabloids say
(as the people magazine)
And crushes hurt both ways

What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do

Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!

What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do

My heart was soakin and I will be in a young world!

What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you

[Jay-Z]
Hove got a young girl
Hove got a young girl
Still not quite 21
So high string
Such a vibrant thing
I introduce myself, (hi miss thing)
You're 19?
No, you're lighting in a bottle I give you a ring tomorrow
The scene that follows
Screams of horror
Classic Steven King novel
Mamma dont think you should take someone so advanced in romance
You should just wait
Pappa dont preach
Hove dont bight
Hopin threw it I might mo your life
Cuz ima show you right
Proper etecit how to hold your knife
Keep it competetive with Opras ?ice?
Be like Janet (take controll of your life)

What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(young girl)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do (young girl)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(young girl)
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
(young girl)

Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!

What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(to young, I'm never to young)
Young girl, so in love with you
(cuz I'm never to young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(to young, I'm never to young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(cuz I'm never to young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(to young, I'm never to young)
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
(cuz I'm never to young!)

My heart was soakin and I will be in a young world!

What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
