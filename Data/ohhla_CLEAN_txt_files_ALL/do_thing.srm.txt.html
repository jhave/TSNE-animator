Verse 1:
Me and my crew in the Benz for a deek, while other peeps trailing me in the
black jeep
Creepin', on our way to a House Party, with no Kid 'N' Play just a fly DJ
I't on and poppin' and we gettin' RIGHT, everythings TIGHT
Everyone has a light, I pull up in the place to be, immediatly swarmed
And all of us is armed, it's cool like that type of scene, crazy blunt
ashes
Girls shaking asses, money makers, video rumpshakes 
And niggas with game fast breakin' just like the Lakers
It's all good if your game is tight, and if you know the scoop don't love
'em like Snoop
Yeah, the reason why, the girls out there get biz, run like a bunch of wild
kids

Hook:
I'm doin' my thing if you feel me do your thing
(Do your thang do your thang) (X4)

Verse 2:
Now the scene is set and now I'm hype
I'm seeing what girls is coming home with me tonight
I spot one on the sofa, sippin' juice, with three other girls, sportin' pin
curls
I said to myself "Excuse yourself E", so I went over and put my hand out
like Billy Dee
Excuse her from the two girls she was with, Macked her put the Flava In her
Ear and split
To the side to the other vibe, where it looked live, protected cause my man
had the 4-5
My boy looked up, asked me if he was hooked up
I said she was shook up, she threw my phone book up 
She gave me every phone number that she knew, a girlfriend for you, a
girlfriend for you (word up)
I stay real, I never perpetrate, cause now adays, falling in love never
pays
I'm quick to say fuck a hoe (yeah) y'all niggas know, I'm strickly for the
doe
Word to God, this is the way that Def Squad swing, it's not just a one day
fling
I represent my style for my peeps, take it to the streets, where we play
for keeps
Have a drink conversate, and pump up your fists and do it like this 

Hook (X6)
