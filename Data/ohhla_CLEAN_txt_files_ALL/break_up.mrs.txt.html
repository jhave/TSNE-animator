Song:   Break Up (The OJ Song)
Typed by: timm2014@hotmail.com

I wanna hear your voice but I don't want you to call
I wanna see you, girl, but not see you at all
I wanna make up, but I still want to fight
I wanted to break up but it just don't feel right
"Sitting here waiting on you"

[Verse One]
I hate you, you hate me, but still can't escape "we"
And all the bullshit we've been going through lately
Heart broke, lovestruck
Telling y'all, "It ain't me."
Life without you, girl, is something that I can't see
I ain't gon' lie, say, "I don't get lonely"
But if only so much, I could kick it with the homies
And somebody told me that you already moved on
I broke up with you, you ain't supposed to get your groove on
Not now, at least wait a couple weeks
Got me looking like a chump with my business in the streets
Been a couple weeks, but it feel like you still there
No matter how I clean, I'm still finding your hair
Or some shit you forgot, or I'm standing in that spot
Where you came so hard, I didn't think that you would stop
But, quiet as it's kept, I know you miss me just a little
Washed my sheets when you left but still smell you on my pillow

[Chorus]
And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of "we"
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

[Verse Two]
You ain't call me last night, what you trying to be? Strong?
You'll call yourself stupid when you finally hear this song
Cause I would've took you back, I was waiting to, in fact
All you had to do was holler, girl, I would've just collapsed
And fell into a trap and started to relapse
And your ass never called so it just never happened
Now I'm thinking Jasmine, Tanya, Cheraine
Some ex's I can call that'll probably ease the pain
I tried to follow through, but I wound up calling you
Hanging up before a ring, girl, it's really all on you
But you wanna get into it, make me mad, push my buttons
Got us tripping over little stuff that don't mean nothing
I'm sick of the suffering, the fighting, the fussing
What happened to the love in the late night discussions
'Bout children, and family, the future, the plan
And now it's all over 'cause you couldn't understand me

[Chorus]
And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of "we"
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together 'cause I hate breaking up

[Verse Three]
Started missing you again last night
'Til I remembered all the reasons that your ass love to fight
It's like, dude
I really wanted this to work
But you, had to get your shit together first
And what's worse
I really wanted you to stay
But I needed you to leave cause we was fighting everyday
All right, not everyday, I know that's a lot on it
We was supposed to be companions
We was more like opponents
Don't this song make you wanna do it one more time?
Could I still be the only dude that's on your mind?
I'm too proud to beg, but I'm hoping that you not
I would take you back quick, girl, without a second thought
But I'm caught up in my pride and I can't make the call
Didn't want to break up, just a break, that's all
It's been a long time, I know I probably shouldn't have left you
Cause your the only woman that I wanna sleep next to

[Chorus]
And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of "we"
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together 'cause I hate breaking up

You say you're sick of me and I say I'm sick of you
But we crazy 'bout each other, girl, what we gon' do?
Said I needed you to leave, but I hate to see you go
Can't make up my mind, girl, I just don't know
I wanna make this work but I'm sick of the struggle
Girl, what I gotta do to make you realize I love you?
I ain't gon' lie, sometimes I just don't feel you
But find another man, and I just might kill you
"Sitting here waiting on you"</pre>
