Typed by: AZ Lyrics

As you fucking a knockers girl I like fucking alot
Need a marker shit nigga might fuck up a knot
Louie Vuitton ye a nigga might fuck up a block
Catch me in a romance a nigga might fuck up a watch
And the girl you got with you might fuck up your watch
Hate a proof vest for suckers is taking up shots
Sex ain't nothing but the truth no feelings involved
Ride nothing but them coops no serious involved

[Chorus]
Is you, is you
Is you fucking tonight
Is you, is you
Is you fucking tonight
I can see it in your eyes he ain't fucking you right
Girl I got what you like is you fucking tonight
Head up I'm do to you girl what I'm gon' do to you
You ain't got to lie baby girl 'cause I know the truth
I can see it in your eyes he ain't fucking you right
Girl I got what you like is you fucking tonight

I be like any faster, she be like any slower
So we meet in the middle, ye you know how that go
She said baby I'm ready I said baby I know
Then I asked her did mine she said baby for sure
She like the way I grind you know she love my fresh
She said she feel it in her chest I'm the fucking best
I said well fuck it I'm the best in
Them busters out your phone baby for the rest in
Ye it's gotta be the best if we blaze in
Give her dad good deed like the Ravens
Make you wanna step back and just take your time
If I ain't told you today girl, God damn you're fine

You say you do it good I like it good I want it good
So we gonna see
You want a nigga come through and hit it right girl you know to call me

[Chorus]
Is you, is you
Is you fucking tonight
Is you, is you
Is you fucking tonight
I can see it in your eyes he ain't fucking you right
Girl I got what you like is you fucking tonight
Head up I'm do to you girl what I'm gon' do to you
You ain't got to lie baby girl 'cause I know the truth
I can see it in your eyes he ain't fucking you right
Girl I got what you like is you fucking tonight

[Bridge]
Don't you know I like it, every
Every time I come around
So baby won't you come and turn it up
You let a nigga put it down
Lay you on your back right there and make sure to keep your legs spread
That's perfect, work it, twerk it now we fucking up the best bread
If you like it she can come too, she can come too
I'm inside I make her cum too

[Chorus]
Is you, is you
Is you fucking tonight
Is you, is you
Is you fucking tonight
I can see it in your eyes he ain't fucking you right
Girl I got what you like is you fucking tonight
Head up I'm do to you girl what I'm gon' do to you
You ain't got to lie baby girl 'cause I know the truth
I can see it in your eyes he ain't fucking you right
Girl I got what you like is you fucking tonight</pre>
