[Intro - Brother Ali - talking]
Yeah, yeah, I love it
I love it, yes I do
Uh, let me get one more, check this out right here

[Verse 1 - Brother Ali]
Started rhymin just to be somebody
To make people notice me at the party
And not be just the new kid that's Albino
Make 'em say "yeah I know but have you heard him rhyme though?"
Now take that same party around the globe
And my story connected with a lot of folks
I hope so 'cause that's the only thing that I know
I know it so well I tell it with my eyes closed
And I go with the feeling from the start
Blind in the eye, so I see you with my heart
And to me all y'all look exactly the same
Fear, faith, compassion and pain
And try as we may to mask, it remains
Such as your religion or your past or your race
The same color blood just pass through our veins
And tears taste the same when they splash on your face
The World's gettin too small to stand in one place
It's like we're roommates just sharin a space
Can't separate and still carry the weight
Gotta heal, get away from the fear and the hate
Gotta shake free from them chains
You see what remains, just a human being end of the day
Don't matter to me what name you gave your spiritual plane
Close your eyes and you'll see what I'm sayin
Uh, I started rhymin just to be somebody
I found out that I already was
'Cause can't nobody be free unless we're all free
There's no me and no you, it's just us
"Street Preacher" what a fan once called me
I've been called worse and tried to live up
Hope you don't mind a few more stories
I swear to God y'all, I tell 'em with love</pre>
