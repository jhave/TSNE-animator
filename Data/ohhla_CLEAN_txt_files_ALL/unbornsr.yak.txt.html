To my unborn child
This goes out to my unborn child in case I don't make it
Just remember daddy loves you
I did everything I could to make away for me and you
Don't worry about what people say about me
You know dady loves you

[Verse One: Tupac]

Now ever since my birth
I've been cursed since I'm born to wild
In case I never get to holler at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison
Blessed and still living
Tryna earn every penny that I'm getting
And reminiscing
To the beginning of my mission
When I was conceived and came to be in this position
My momma was a Panther loud
Single parent but she proud
when she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
Went to school but I dropped out
And left the house
Cause my mama say I'm good for nothing
so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live
God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and i'll never steal again
Or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wanting revenge for the agony they did to me
See my life ain't promised but it's sure get better
Hope you understand my love letter
To my unborn child

[Chorus X2]
A letter to my unborn child
Ohhhh yeah
(To my unborn)
Yeaaah
(To my unborn)

[Verse Two: Yaki Kadafi *Performed byt Rizz, The Kidz*]

There ain't no gaurantee's for tomorrow
It's just pain and sorrow
To maintain cause these times is hard
So I burn and withhold thought's
To give you a little wisdom so you don't get caught
And still tried
In a cash 22 I use to dash for the cash
Wanting grand's in van's
22's in my shoe
And a dummy is the fool who forget's the code
Hold the feild steady, keep your eyes on the road
When your seed is grown maybe then you'll understand
It ain't living so Thug Life is all that we have
If your missing your dad just take a look to the star's
I'm up above and i'm seeing everything that you are
And the only way to win the race got to get in to it running
And turn the cowards into idiot's for trying to get your hundred's
So please don't cry
Outlawz we never die
Multiply and keep moving for the revolution
(To my unborn child)
Kadafi
P.S.
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeyyoooooooooooooooooooo

[Chorus]

To my unborn child
Please take of all my seed's
To my unborn child
To my unborn child
This letter goes out to
Any seeds that I might not get to see
Cause of this lifestyle a nigga live
Just know that your daddy loves you
Got nothing but love for you
And ll I wanted was for you have a better life than I did
So I was out here on a twenty-four hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age you'll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I'll see you up there ighetto from heaven
Cause there's ghetto heaven gotta be there
(haha)
Take care
Run wild but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know that sometimes it's confusing
The rules of the game is gonna get you through it, all day everyday
Watch out for these snakes and fakes
Friends comin down the way..
Be an individual
Work hard, stay thugging, get your mind staright
Trust nobody
Money over bitches
Don't let these niggas run you round
Don't let no man put his hand's on you
Don't let no woman use you
Don't be a trick
Don't be a playa hater
And don't be a wife beater
With all my heart
Your pop's
Tupac

[Rizz, The Kidz]

I know your hearing this Yak
We holding it down for these children man
We holding it down for these children man
Holding it down for these children man</pre>
