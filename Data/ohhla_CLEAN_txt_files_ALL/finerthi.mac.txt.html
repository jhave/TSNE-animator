Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You kno the finer things in life
ya know
sometimes you gotta kick back and enjoy that shit
look
just relax
(roll that sticky up) summer time bitch

I like sitting in shotgun deuce on an L
parents not caring cause they used to the smell
Classy ass women
fresh ass linen
hot summer dayz w/a pool I can swim in
a good spot to kick it
a case full of 40s
Them homies always havin good stories
the beer bottles with the twist off caps
when old people tell you they listen to rap
I love days I can sleep in
4 day weekends
hoes puttin ther clothes back on you peekin
blunt rides w/the mixtape bumpin
I love makin love in public
and when the hip hop legend tour comin to your town
findin a crispy ass 20 on the ground
walkin with the sun out
watchin runs house
reaction movies when the villain pull his gun outtt

The best in life is the free ones
ahh
the little things everybody need some
the finer thingggs make you feel betttter but no one ever seem to remember
the best things in life is the free ones
the little things everybody needs some
the finer thingggs make you feel betttter but no one ever seem to remember

I'm like sleepin in class
I'm cheatin to pass
hoes walkin in the halls n you reach for their ass
fast food lines when they movin so quickly
when your weedman hit you with some sticky
street performers warmin up the corners
sellin by the ounce &amp; pitchin by the quarter
where some kicks on sale
wakin up in the morning w/a shitload of mail
the wake up the bake up
chillin while you face blunts
going in blowed (be it shape up?) like say what?
what? blog put your tape up
get a good review
when dumbass people tell you what you should'nt do
when she rub my head when I'm b/w her kneees
ha
getting love from the people overseas
haters tryina hate but they got nothing to say

The best in life is the free ones
ahh
the little things everybody need some
the finer thingggs make you feel bettter but no one ever seem to remember
the best things in life is the free ones
the little things everybody needs some
the finer things make you feel betttter but no one ever seem to remember</pre>
