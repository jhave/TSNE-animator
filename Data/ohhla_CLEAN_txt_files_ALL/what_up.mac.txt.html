Typed by: AZ Lyrics

What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
Just makin music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
Soo what up cousin...

How you been, homie?
What it is, homie?
Without you here, your family feel lonly
But it's all good cousin, we gone carry on
Although it seems so unfair your gone
People nowadays neva focus on the positives
Cause life nows only good when the guap is big
They talkin shit, hatin for no reason
Haters is stupid...baby my flow, leave'em
So confused cause they all up bout this dumb shit
Lisa said she love it and the other shit is rubish
So ima make my time here worth it, real god for you
Lookin' back like theres nothin I couldn't do
And theres nothin that I wouldn't do to bring you back
Poetry, heart an soul singin rap, I've been thinkin that i
Found my passion rappin bout the future in an old school fashion

What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
Just makin music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
Soo what up cousin...

They say my style ain't different, I'm just like every body else
They say my pitches gotta change up, but all those people is
Just hatin cause they don't know how to love theyself
Mad when someone bring my name up
An its unfortunate cause I'm just here comin from the heart
Shit, I'm just tryna find somethin for the market
An I ain't sayin that I'm from the worst hardships, but
My life ain't no walk in the park, its been a shark pit
Dark with no harvest, drivin in a car but cant find a place to park it
I got some people that I really need to talk with
That musta been what got this shit started
Theres been some people that I haven't said goodbye to
But my life gotta go on, an it don't mean that we forget
Because we dedicate our lives to, thats why I wrote this fuckin song

What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
Just makin music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
Soo what up cousin...

Shits real out there, ain't nobody playin' round
I got some bangers an some druggies that I hang around
Erry body does their own thing and you can find me
On the corner makin money when its snowing
I sell a lil weed, get my pockets fat
But I talk to cats who be movin lots of crack
It ain't the good life, it ain't the bad, its just makin the best of what we have
I'll put the dollars down an move into the lab
Thats how much I want this music shit to last
An some days I feel its movin to fast
Schools gone pass, not rememberin' a class
Start to leave, before you know its time to grow up
Focus on the real try not to get ya hopes up
So far I've had some hard work an a lil luck
Some make it to the money, I ain't gone give it up

What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
Just makin music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
Soo what up cousin...</pre>
