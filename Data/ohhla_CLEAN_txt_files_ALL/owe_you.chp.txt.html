Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Check
You can catch me down in Santa Monica with Veronica Kim and Monica
Hoping that one of them play me like I'm a harmonica
Long as they don't ask for nothing we won't have no problem bruh
I'm a just pull some tree and then go hit your college up
Fitted to the max yes, I get total access
We coppin' all these asses, my girl look like a actress
She realer than you ever been, fuck who you said you better than
That shit you kick irrelevant, call me the benevolent
Def spot, the rest not, fucking with this nigger from the CL who added [?] to be
Fuck these other niggaz cause, when you poppin' niggaz run at you like it's a track meet
Some trying to get money some just do it for they rap sheet
To just to say I fuck with that nigger to build they brand up
Make your own lane nigger stand up
My shit originated from the hood where it's supposed to
Why you niggers coming at me funny like I owe you?
Niggaz where was you at when we was killin' shit?
They don't want to hustle, they just wanna reap the benefits
Niggers coming out the woodwork, that shit be so true
My status got them looking at me jealous when I roll through

[Chorus]
Owe you? Owe you? Nigga what I owe you?
Owe you? Owe you? Nigga do I know you?
Owe you? Owe you? Nigga what I owe you?
Where was you at when we was killin' shit on the road dude?

Owe you? Owe you? Nigga what I owe you?
Owe you? Owe you? Nigga do I know you?
Owe you? Owe you? Nigga what I owe you?

Nigga what I owe you

[Verse 2]
You can catch me down on ocean drive posted up chillin' out with my partners
Crack a shelly twist one up and then dip back over the columns
Got a problem, I'm addicted to tats and wonderful reefer
Want some pounds?
Just have one of my gangster bitches meet you and
They don't play around nigga, they 'a lay you down
Every dime toting seventeen rounds for you clowns
Keep the peace, keep the peace, I keep my eyes underneath
When I ride through the streets
Some niggers want us deceased
Cause we doing everything they wish they could do
But I just got this all from doing everything you should do
Headed to Detroit blazing tree until I'm brainless
Bout to fuck with Finally Famous we lions don't try to tame us
We grindin' we get this paper, we flying to other places
Flyer we makin' statements so why is you niggers hatin'?
They 'posed to, and when I speak it so true
My status got them looking at me jealous when I roll through

[Chorus]
Owe you? Owe you? Nigga what I owe you?
Owe you? Owe you? Nigga do I know you?
Owe you? Owe you? Nigga what I owe you?
Where was you at when we was killin' shit on the road dude?

Owe you? Owe you? Nigga what I owe you?
Owe you? Owe you? Nigga do I know you?
Owe you? Owe you? Nigga what I owe you

Nigga what I owe you</pre>
