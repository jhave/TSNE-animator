[Missy]
Ooooooh, I don't want I don't need I can't stand no minute man
I don't want no minute man
Ooooooh, here's your chance be a man take my hand understand
I don't want no minute man

Ohh, ohh, uhh, OOOH
Ohh, ohh..
Ohh, ohh, uhh, OOOH
Ohh, ohh..

[Missy]
Boy I'ma make you love me, make you want me
And I'ma give you some attention, tonight
Now follow my intuitions, what you're wishin
See I'ma keep you all night, for a long time
Just start countin the ways

[Chorus]
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no..

[Missy]
Tonight I'ma give it to you, throw it to you
I want you to come prepared, ohhh yeah (oh yes)
Boy it's been a long time, a crazy long time
And I don't want no minute man, and that's real
Give it to me some more

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Fifty grand I get this on one take (Hova)
Look, I'm not tryin to give you love and affection (uh-huh)
I'm tryin to give you sixty seconds of perfection (uh-huh)
I'm tryin to give you cabfare and directions
Get your +Independent+ ass out of here - QUESTION?
I'm not your man, not Ralph Tresvant
Not Ronnie Romance.. no ma
I'm tryin to hit you then put you in the middle of the round
like I'm Roberto Duran.. no mas
Six A.M. another chick in the house (put your hands up)
6:15 another chick kicked you out (put your hands up)
Spend one minute tryin to dig her out
The other fourteen tryin to "put it in her mouth"
The dick too chubby, too much'll make you love me
Now be a nice wifey and run home to your hubby
Cause we, both knowin what we doin is wrong
Don't forget to put your ring back on {*quiet laughter*}

[Missy]
Ooooooh, I don't want I don't need I can't stand no minute man
I don't want no minute man
Ooooooh, here's your chance be a man take my hand understand
I don't want no minute man

Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man

Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man

Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man

Break-break me off, break break me off
Break break me off, show me what you got

Break me off, show me what you got..
Break me off, show me what you got..
Break me off, show me what you got..
Break me off, break break me off</pre>
