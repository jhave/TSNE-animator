(talking)
So I had to memorize these rhymes until I got home
Ya understand?  Once you memorize a sentence
It's like an exercise (echoes)

*heavy breathing*

(talking)
Ya niggas can't be serious right now
I'm the all time heavy weight champion of flowers
I'm leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now
Best flow, Most consistent, Realest stories
Most charisma, I set the most trends
And my interviews are hotter
Holla

I jog in the graveyard
Spar in the same ring
Now it's house by the building
Where Malcolm X was slain
I spring train in the winter
Round early December
Run suicide drills over and over
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
That's why they call me "Hova"
I'm far from being God
But I work goddamn hard
I wake up the birds who in the nerves is sleep
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one end
I am "focused man"
And I'm not afraid of death
And I'm going all out
I circle the vultures in a van and
I run the block (run)
Pull up in a drop (pull up)
Push up on my money (push up)
I'm in great shape dunny
I keep jacks jumping thirty six sets
Like a personal trainer I teach coke to stretch
I pump and rock sweats
All white trainers
The ghettoes, Billy Blanks
I show you niggas what pain is
Maintain your stamina
Hov will damage ya
Spot you two rhymes y'all niggas is amateurs
The fifth
A dead lift if
Niggas don't want to get shot then y'all niggas better squat
I drop your set for rep
No need to hit the showers
The spit from the fifth leave you wet
Lyrical exercise
(hard breathing)
Y'all niggas ain't tired right?

(Chorus 4X)
One, One
Two, Two
Three, Three
Four, Breathe Easy

Suckers
Get your weight up
Not your hate up
Jigga man is diesel
When I lift the eight up
Y'all ain't ready to workout with the boy
Your flow is brain on drugs
Mines is rap on steroids
I lift every voice when I sing
My ability
Make yours look like an exercise in futility
Bring your squad
Biceps, Triceps, and Quads
We don't struggle with undeveloped muscles
Y'all ain't real
That's y'all Achilles Heel
Same routine when you see me you know the drill
I spot ya
I lift the weight of the watch off your arm
Remain nice and calm
Put down your things
Trinidad of the game know my way around your ring
No matter how many pounds you bring
It sounds like the same old thing
R-O-C is the strongest team

(Chorus 4X)</pre>
