Typed by: AZ Lyrics

What if what if what if what if what if what if you was transported in time
To the place and the spot where Christ had to die
What if you beheld with your own two eyes
Where his blood was spilled where he gave his life
When he came up the hill and he was barely alive
Could you tell who he was if he walked on by
Could you see what they had done to his back and his sides
Would you see all his love would you recognize
When they pierced his skull with the thorns and they tried to
Pull out his hair out his beard and then decide to
Pierce his bareback 39 times you
Get the real facts they're there besides you
What if you saw him die and got a real view
Would you keep living the life the way that you do
Or would you run and hide and just continue to
Live your life blind its up to you dude

Will you ever know will you ever see
What's he's done for you what he's done for me
Can you ever know can you ever see
What will it take for you to believe

What if today was the very day he died
What if you was standing right there by his side
As the people cheered and they screamed and they cried
But this time around see he wasn't crucified
What if he was lead from a jail cell this time
To be executed in the middle of the night
But you could view it and tune it in worldwide
On the internet and on the TV it was televised
What if you was standing right there
And you brought him down to the electric chair
You had to flip the switch now would you be aware
Would you understand his death would you even care
Would you change how you live would you shed a tear
Would you see what he did would you be prepared
To give your life to him right now and right there
Can u see what he did its quite clear

What if you held the very nails used to
Hold him on the cross then what would you do
You saw him beat up beat down then abused
Would you see how much it cost him now for you but
What would it take for him to prove
That he took the blame for everything that we do
It's still just the same man there aint nothing new
They still hate to change and come down to you but
What if you could gaze and just see
The last 5 minutes before he would leave
This earth and worse what if you saw him breathe
His last breath when death took his life you see
His head hang down he starts to heave
Cuz his death came slow its plain to see
That it's more painful then we could imagine it to be
Now you seen in plain view will you believe</pre>
