['Beowulf' sample]
Tonight will be different
Tonight, he will find Geats waiting for him, not frightened sheep

[9th Prince]
It's time, aiyo, I was born the black Messiah
I was born, to expose all liars, my son name is Elijah
He got the power to heal the blind
The first lesson I was taught, is to stop eating swine
And don't believe in lies taught by mankind, praise the lord
Then pass the ammunition, like John Lennon
I'm part of the revolution, the solution
Stop the drugs, violence and prostitution
Build better schools, the seeds need to start droppin' more jewels
Before the hip hop community, drown in the devil's pool
I'm Malcolm X, I'm Noble Drew Ali, I'm Martin Luther King
I'm Nelson Mandela, fresh out of Sing-Sing
Or Abraham Lincoln, freeing the slaves and paving the way
My tongue is an AK, the world is a battlefield
I aim to kill all negativity, trying to lock down my will
But wait it gets ill, no tricks in '09, it's time to build
And shopping out my real skills, so what's the deal
We can listen to Farrakhan, pop champagne and still chill

"If you go away" - sample

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, the second verse is like a chapter out the bible
Thou shall not kill, thou shall not steal
Thou shall not squeal, thou shall not abandon
Pick up The Ten Commandments, to get a better understanding
I'm KRS-One, By Any Means Necessary
I'm Dead Prez, with a Talib Kweli vocabulary
I'm Killah Priest from the Middle East
Refusing, the mark of the beast
Teaching on these corners of these dark streets
I'm a Poor Righteous Teacher, coming through your speakers
From right to left, everything I say is Mos Def
I'm not from Chicago, but me and the rapper got something in Common
We both make sense, this song ain't about drama and suspense
It's war like, going against the teaching of Willie Lynch
Let's come together to make it better
No matter the stormy weather, stay black and get that cheddar
So we can build for the future, future

"If you go away" - sample

[Planet Asia]
Black leader with a heater, the resurrection of me
I'm peace, God, we never celebrate Easter
Or anything the beast does, feast your eyes on these thugs
Who sling drugs, getting his G's up
Diamonds in a rough, black conglomerates, the power is us
It's a collective, we can do alotta damage and plus
Just what it look like, back against the wall, me and my brothers
Dealing with science, high as a kush-ite
My solar flames cook mics, now is your shit mythological
Or archeological, my name printed in Egypt in hieroglyphics
I'm a monument, a czar to who be, the most dominant, magical molicule
Maker of mankind, the planet is mines, by a landslide
I'm on the throne as long as the fans ride, I dig it
It's easy, and we never letting the brand die, MC's
Sweeter than a slice of pecan pie
I come through looking blessed, surrounded by 24 elders
And seven angels of death, visions that appear when I rest
Yo, I learned reality, is only what the mind's able to manifest, yes

"If you go away" - sample

['Malcolm X' sample]
Before there was any such thing as a Republican or a Democrat, we were black
Before there was any such thing as a Mason or an Elk, we were black
Before there was any such thing as a Jew or a Christian, we were black people
In fact, before there was any such place as America, we were black
And after America has long passed from the scenethere will still be black people
I'm gonna tell you like it really is
