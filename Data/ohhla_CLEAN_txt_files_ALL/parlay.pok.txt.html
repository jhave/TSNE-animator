Whether sunny or grey, we gon ball n' parlay
Pour a drank and smoke hay, we gon ball n' parlay

(Lil KeKe)
I'm a shine in grey, ball n' parlay
Got skills to pay the bills is all I display, by the way
I been showin up since nine-tre today 
They still got somethin to say
But it's okay, true to the game about my fifty
I'm a sew this thang up if the rap game let me
It's me keepin 'em blind they can't see, Young G
But you can call me Don KeKe
Nothin's free, I stay on the grind and get mine
Flossin at all times went from grind to grind
Two times to the mind cause I'm one of a kind
Whether sunny or grey, there's only one way to shine
I'm a pour up drank, roll up dank, stay on the grind
Slow up bank, hold up man
Me, Big Pokey, 3-2, we stay on a mission
H-Town for life representin the commision

Whether sunny or grey, we gon ball n' parlay
Pour a drank and smoke hay, we gon ball n' parlay
Whether sunny or grey, we gon ball n' parlay
Pour a drank and smoke hay, we gon ball n' parlay

(Mr. 3-2)
Now we gon ball in the mix, U-haul bricks
Across state lines, but loose lips sank ships
I'm all about makin chips, takin trips, that's my thesis
Me and some jazzy broads parlayin on nude beaches
My piece is iced out, diamonds hit you in the face
Leanin and codienin off of a speed chase
A pint and a two-liter, with nine millimeter
To get you up off me I'm a squash you like a mosquito
Take a breather and lay back on my head rest
Sittin in the turnin lane and I feel a little plex
And animosity, but I don't bar what you say
We bold up and showed up I aint got time to conversate
Business is looking great I ball every day of the year
Keepin these funny bunny busters out my atmosphere
Mr. 3-2, Big Pokey, and Lil KeKe
Gon parlay, sunny or grey, and ball in these streets

Whether sunny or grey, we gon ball n' parlay
Pour a drank and smoke hay, we gon ball n' parlay
Whether sunny or grey, we gon ball n' parlay
Pour a drank and smoke hay, we gon ball n' parlay

When it's sunny or grey, we gon parlay n' ball
Turn up the pint bottle till we lean and fall
Wall to wall with this ballin shit
Popped up top and factory paint with kicks
Plus my screens lit
Broads on the sidelines, gettin they peep on
Snatch one, get a room and get your freak on
Smile trick, you on Candid Camera
I hit these bops, see if he got some baller's stamina
Hit close to ball, plus it's easy to fall
Tryin to knock down the mall, you better slow down and crawl
Before you walk, nigga 
Slang a little mo chalk, nigga
Mash till you get paid and overload the vault, nigga
No doubt, we off the heezy, G
360 degrees and that's Parcheesi
See, we ain't playin, vato, we out parlayin
It's goin down in H-Town, that's all a nigga sayin

Whether sunny or grey, we gon ball n' parlay
Pour a drank and smoke hay, we gon ball n' parlay
Whether sunny or grey, we gon ball n' parlay
Pour a drank and smoke hay, we gon ball n' parlay
Whether sunny or grey, we gon ball n' parlay
Pour a drank and smoke hay, we gon ball n' parlay
Whether sunny or grey, we gon ball n' parlay
Pour a drank and smoke hay, we gon ball n' parlay

Parlay, pa-a-arlay, yeah
Parlay, parlay, parlay
Parlay, ball n' parlay
Parlay, parlay
Sunny or grey
It's gonna be okay, hey
Ball n' parlay
Ba-a-all n' parlay
