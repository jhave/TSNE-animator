*some off key singing of Here Comes the Bride by Digital Underground*

[Humpty talking while they sing]
Uhh, kick it y'all
Ahh yeah

[Shock G]
Heheheheheh
Yo Hump, gonna do a lil somethin like this

Lots of little knots that need to be tied
A pair of knuckleheads walkin side by side
down the altar, you say to yourself, "I will not falter"
But you're thinkin it -- how did I get myself in this predicament?
Saw the def cutie that made your heart sing
You hop to the shop to get a ring (a big diamond)
You hop to the shop to buy a ring (a BIG DIAMOND!)
You hopped to the shop and got a ring...
Felt left out cause all your friends are hooked
But now you're at the altar, your goose is cooked
You say a prayer, "Lord please give me strength to make it through"
Opened up your nervous mouth, slipped and said, "I do"
	I don't, IdoIdoIdo, I don't I don't, IdoIdo, I don't, I don't
Look you do son, now hurry up and kiss the brizide
Peace said the father, cause now the knot is tied

[DU] Tie the knot, tie tie the knot
[HH] Yeah it's time to make the move
[DU] Tiffi tiffi tie the knot
[SG] Uhh
[DU] Tie the knot, tie tie the knot
[HH] Yo it's time to make the move
[DU] Tiffi tiffi tie the knot
[HH] Tie the knot y'all
[DU] Tie the knot, tie tie the knot
[HH] It's time to make the move
[DU] Aibbi ibbi abba abba tie the knot
[SG] Uhh, kick it
[DU] Tie the knot, TIE TIE THE KNOT!
[HH] It's time to make the move
[DU] IFFY IBBI ABBA DABBA TIE THE KNOT
[HH] Kick the vocals!

*Digital Underground starts singing Here Comes the Bride off key again*

Aww man, y'all some lousy singers
Alright fellas, knock it off, knock it off, break it down
