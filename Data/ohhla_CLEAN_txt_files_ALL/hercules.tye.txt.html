(Intro: Ty shouting)
Heyyy, youuu!

(Chorus)
Hercules, remember me fool?
Me and you used to go to the same primary school
And I remember school then. You was the bully
And I was one of the children

You used to treat me like dirt and hurt my inners
I already knew the school paid for my dinners
That's right, flares were worn, shoes were torn
I was the subject of scorn, wondering why I was born
While you - you had it all
You was the rude boy plus the bad boy at football
You couldn't be touched with a barge pole
You was the captain of the ship and we was the cargo
You used to play pat ball, you hated me so much
Much so because I gave you low cuts - the cuts below
'Cos it was my only defence, against
A Hercules figure that was this much bigger
Extra, extra, vexed and sorta very violent
That's why it was best to always keep quiet
A church mouse, verses a powerhouse
You was up North and I was definitely South
A church mouse, verses a powerhouse
You was up North and I was definitely South

(Chorus)
Hercules, remember me fool?
Me and you used to go to the same primary school
Hercules, remember me fool?
Me and you used to go to the same primary school
And I remember school then. You was the bully
And I was one of the children

Now, who's the brother with the brand new kicks?
Kiss chasing all the chicks, pocket full of 'Swizzle Sticks'
'Bazooka Bubblegum', 'Space Dust' and 'Wham!'
Technicolour bed fluff meant I wasn't the man
For kiss chase, now that was real life trauma
Girls would break down and cry if I caught them in the corner
I guess it was my Elvis Presley sheep skin jacket
And my holy toes were peeking outside my socks and outside my shoes
Got a lot of stress from you and you and you
Still, life's a game, and I guess I'm a learner
Used to fantasize about my neighbour's 'Rally Burner'
All I wanted in life was a 'Grifter'
Got fed up, went and stole one with my sister
We rode all day, at the end we put it back
Couldn't have took it home, I would've received slaps
On my D-O-M-E, you see my mummy
She would've slapped me on my B stroke S-I-D-E
For trying to do such conforming to other peoples needs
Now I'm learning the game with speed, Hercules
Trying to do such conforming to other peoples needs
Now I'm learning the game with speed, Hercules

(Chorus)
Hercules, remember me fool?
Me and you used to go to the same primary school
Hercules, remember me fool?
Me and you used to go to the same primary school
And I remember school then. You was the bully
And I was one of the children
(Repeat)

(Outro: Ty talking)
Now, I know, that school was a long time ago and, 
you probably feel that y'know, 
you don't have to account for your actions, and I don't want you to.
I just want you to know one thing, 
y'know maybe one two or three things. 
I am now bigger, better, smarter, sexier, I'm the man! 
Just take away my rubbish alright? Thank you.</pre>
