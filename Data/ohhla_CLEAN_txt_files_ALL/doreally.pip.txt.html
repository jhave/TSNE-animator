Enter the dragon
I was just kickin out some karate kicks
With some tantalising lyrics!

Send this one to all lyric lovers
With the unknown, Sharky P, Melody, DT

Woo Woo

Woo!

Do you really like it?
Do you really like it?
We're lovin' it
Lovin' it, lovin' it
We're lovin' it
Like that

Do you really like it?
Is it, is it wicked?
We're lovin' it
Lovin' it, lovin' it
We're lovin' it like that

(Switch!)

Hardcore!
You know the score
Rhymes so good
I deserve an award
All that style we bring
Will make you laugh
Like you was
A little child again
Smooth, that's how I roll
I've got so much soul
I wanna I step into the party
I wanna move somebody
I wanna move somebody
We're the masters of the ceremony
What does it take
To be a garage MC?
Personality
Originality
On a microphone
They got to be (yeah!)

The capital U.N. the K.N.O
Will get down
Represents our London towns
Pied Piper's on the decks
Rock the discotheque
And I'm back in a sec'

This one's for
The heads out there
Party people
Can you hear me play it?
If you like it
Let me see your
Hands in the air
If you don't
Y'all get the hell
Out of here

Bass is kickin'
Drums is drummin'
When you hear "du-du-du"
I'm comin'
Sharky represents
The west of London
DT, Piper, Melody and unknown
Represents the rest
How we flex
North, South, East, West
Do you really like it?
Du Du Du Du
YES!
We're gunna drop them lyrics
Over Piper's face
5 Blackstreet ladies if you need a place
We're gunna take you to wonderland just like Alice
Place where the music
Ain't loud but lavish

We're lovin' it
Lovin' it, lovin' it
We're lovin' it
Like this
We're lovin' it
Lovin' it, lovin' it
We're lovin' it like that
DT, Melody, Sharky, P
Enough to make you rock
Sing, we come to sing
And dance till we drop

Do you really like it?
Do you really like it?
We're lovin' it
Lovin' it, lovin' it
We're lovin' it like this
Do you really like it?
Is it, is it wicked?
We're lovin' it
Lovin' it, lovin' it
We're lovin' it like that

Ooh
How you like my..
How you like my..
How you like my style?
x5


Do you really like it?
Is it, Is it Wicked?

(Switch!)

Oooh
How you like my..
How you like my..
How you like my style, style, style

(Switch!)

On your marks
Get set
Let's go
Five, four, three, two, one and zero
Get on, Jump, And do the limbo
Check we go
Check we go
Check we go
BLO!
Aint you in this sound?
Do you really wanna get down?
Hit that mix
Hit that blend
Back to Back now
Makin it back now (when?!)
(That's right, That's right!)
And when you're with Melody
I'm the one wit' the team
wit' the team
wit the free
Peace and love wit the skibadee
And that's the way that it's got to be
It goes down with a one and two
And selecta, you know the coo
Gunna get down with the original fun
Pied Piper gunna make you hype for the sky


Jump, don't ever stop
With a little bit of this
Little bit of that
Jump, don't ever stop
With a little bit of this
Little of that that
Jump, don't ever stop
With a little bit of this
Little of that that
Jump, don't ever stop
With a little bit of this
Little bit of that
Little bit of fun
Little bit of jokes
Little bit of jinx
Little bit of smoke
Little bit of this
We do bravo
