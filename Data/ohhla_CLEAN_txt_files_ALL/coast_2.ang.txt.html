[Wyclef Jean]
Wyclef, chillin with Angie
Live at Jimmy's, worldwide baby
Azuuuu-car!

[Chorus: Wyclef]
Suavemente, be-sa-me
Angie Martinez, can I get a date on Friday?
Suavemente, just when I thought she'd say yes..
Yo, yo, that's when a kid pulled the tec and the whole crowd parted
Why you fuckin up the party before it gets started?

[Angie Martinez]
Yo, yo, yo, yo it's Angie
The way I flip it make you switch your shit to plan B
And I'll be dipped out in the club lookin fancy
And we ain't chillin too tough if you ain't family
You mad at me man please I'm chillin low-key
That's why I got my little hat on
In the V.I.P. where everybody high fash-ion
Gettin they mack on, thirsty fo' satisfaction
And it's, bound to happen like latins goin platinum
Now we, in it lookin for the big peso
And my, song inspired by Elvis Crespo
And we, gettin it started so baby let's go
Nasty boys in the party singin, "Dale juebos!"
Better, make it easy cause we livin suave
Be bout the +Smooth Operators+ like Sade
"Coast 2 Coast, New York to Chicago
East L.A."

[Chorus]

[Angie Martinez]
Funny how times flies when you gettin drunk (uh-huh)
It's three A.M. and we still ain't had enough (uh-huh)
Bout the time when everybody know whassup
See them niggaz pushin up, now you know they wanna (WHAT?)
See the big pop-pas chasin mu-cha-chas
Whylin out, right right, be like ooh-la-la
But they gets na-da, make me laugh ha-ha
Like HA-HA-HA, HA-HA!
They be, silly boys in brand new clothes (uh-ha)
Actin up with nothin, puttin on shows (uh-ha)
At the bar, frontin, strikin up a pose
in cubic zircon's like nobody knows, but
it's okay papi, I won't tell (uh-huh)
If they don't know you might as well
do your thang duh-dah-dah-duh-dah
Pero suave yo!

[Chorus] - 2X

[Wyclef]
Suavemente (uh-ha!).. (uh-huh)
Suavemente (uh-ha!).. (uh-huh)
