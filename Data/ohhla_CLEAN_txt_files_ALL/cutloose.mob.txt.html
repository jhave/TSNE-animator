[Verse One: Kalage]
My shorty done cut me loose, and left me in the wind
Got a new man wit a Ph.D. and cheese, but he pees in the pants
He's 60, she's in her 20's, she said I be hard in her, overworking her
And when I hit from back it feels like I'm birthing her
She said I'm wrong for her, too long for her
But she never complained when I bought my ex home for her
But now she dropped me, like the pen at the end of a Sprint commercial
I try to hit it she be like no, like Laura Winslow to Urkel
And What if I did misuse and abuse your clique, I'll apoligize
'Cause I aint know ruler sticks would bruise the clique
I saw it on tape tried to do the shit
Now, she say she want somebody simple
She say she want somebody gentle
She said, when I got head, I dug in her cheek now she got a dimple
I, I, I mean she cute with it though, I, I couldn't help it
The way she swallowed my pelvis
Had me seeing shit, had a nigga reaching for Elvis
And I come on her head, that some I'm a miss
That girl gave my dick more hickeys than a damn redneck locksmith

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
My shorty done cut me loose
She fucking other niggas and she fucking me too
She say she don't want no more
If she feeling like I'm feeling then she won't go
My shorty done cut me loose
She fucking other niggas and she fucking me too
She say she don't want no more
She say she don't want no more

[Verse Two: Boondox Blak]
I woke up this morning stretching,yawning with a hard on ??? ready to bone
Then I reached on my right and realized my woman's gone
I got to bring her to bed to hit her some more, but I found this envelope
Sitting on the pillow, I opened it, unfolded it, it said Dear Smoke
Hey, it's me Little Debbie Cake, and I feel it's best we separate
At least until I'm in better shape
cause I'm doing my best to shut up and take
The way you ramming inches in me
Slam me in different positions
Grasp and grip my hips and titties
Put one leg up drag and flip me
Fucking me up, down, back, to front
(How you squeezing and smacking my butt)
From right to left, left to right
(and peeing across my breast and thighs)
Fucking me early Monday, again on Tuesday
humpday Wednesday, then come Thursday
Twice on Friday and Saturday, and after church on Sunday
Hurting my stomach, beating the cock
But trip when I ask you to eat me twice, so we need to stop
Cause lately I been bleeding a lot, so I'm leaving you dox
To find someone that's fair and square
And not so hairy there, who fucks me there with care
Cause you put too much wear and tear on my derriere

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
