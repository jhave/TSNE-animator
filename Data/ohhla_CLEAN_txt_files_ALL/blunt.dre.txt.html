DEAD!

INTRO
(Blunt time-pull out your philly)Ha ha,mighty Aftermath
(Sip a glass of 'gnac,reload your nine milli)
Whose soul ever contest,DEAD!
In me ear Dre.You hear me now?DEAD!
(Blunt time-pull out your philly)
(Sip a glass of 'gnac,reload your nine milli)

Thought they were moving in and now they wanna cut us wrong
Room for moving in,but that was on-ly mine
They will shake the hand,never really seen and only heard
They will shake the hand,he is only to heard l-oo-oo-ng
Knick-knack,paddy wack give a dog a bone
Long Beach City I wreck is my zone
I be the solo rollo which means I rule alone
You droop first blood,mother thought you was the lone
Fool now break for ya two
It's called the ol'Rambo,catch ambush
I wish you wouldn't moosh like ya wanna come push
I'll dump ya and leave ya stankin in the forest you Gump
Long Beach City-firmly represented
Narrator X is representor
Lyrical the kick make me ya mentor
Freeze MCs,don't ent-or
I'll take like Anne Arden's new chips in wint-or
Or since I'm Sun I'll melt the metaphor
The meatphors are meltin,style is beltin
I heard a dog yelpin but no helpin

CHORUS
Blunt time-pull out your philly
Sip a glass of 'gnac,reload your nine milli
Dancin,puffin,sippin or set trippin
Dimes keep on flippin flippin
REPEAT

Dre's bad beats they Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat
X flex lyric they can't come back
Fact:El-elevant,elegant and eloquent no shit
I boots hits,throw tantrums like Ella Fitz
Nah,the member X but you'll remember X indeedy
Now remember don't contest the (?Frex?)
Got you in spot like Lindscrafter but you try to diss
I burn you like Backdrafter
After that you'll get nothing from me but laughter
Similar to this,HA what's the repertoire-kick deadly wit lyrics
Shot your punk ass like ELEC now it's

CHORUS

Mighty Aftermath!
Once again.can't hold us back
Refuse,refuse(DEAD!)you lose(DEAD!).DEAD!(Indeed)
Attempts wiil be futile,it's way to brutal
