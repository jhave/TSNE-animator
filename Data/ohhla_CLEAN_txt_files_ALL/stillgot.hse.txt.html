Still Gotta lotta love (repeat 8X)

Much love to my man Leor
Keep rockin' them beats and gettin' parties on the floor
Much love for my man Danny Boy
Ever since you came in my life you helped bring me joy
Much love for my man Grand Mixer-Mugs
For taking me off the street and mixin' with the thugs
And much love love for my man B-Real
I'm glad you got rid of that steel
And much love for my man Sen-Dog
The crews rolling thicker than some London fog
And much love for my man Steve Urkel
I trust him wit' my life and with the loop from every show
And much love for my brody named Justin
Cause if anyone steps up I know you gonna bust 'em
And much love for my man Scott Ian
For bein' a really down to earth human bein'
And much love to my man Guy-O
Cause every day of the week he's got another fine ho
And much love to my man Bronx Style
You came to my party and son, you made it worthwhile
And much love to my man Son Doobie
If I needed it again you'd sell the gun back to me
And much love to my man Ralph Emms and the Tomahawk Funkster
Funky like a dumpster
And much love to my man Kaves, ADMoney and the Edge
With family like Sister Sledge
And much love to my moms and my sister and my niece
And everyone out there fighting the beast
And much love to the pioneers
Cause I'm gettin' pain for rhymin' and drinkin' beers
And much love to the ultra magnetic
Cause everybody knows you never got enough credit

Still gotta lot of Love
Gotta lotta love (repeat 10X)
Still gotta lot of Love
