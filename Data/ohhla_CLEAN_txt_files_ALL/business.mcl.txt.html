[Missy]
Hahaha, introducing MC Lyte

[MC Lyte]
I think I need a sound check
Hit me with a sound check
Yea, now what about that dope stuff
Alright now, gimme an 8-0 (8-0, 8-0, 8-0)

[Missy]
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh 
Yo, 1-2
Uh, MC Lyte (yea)
You dont know (yea)
Ficky ficky, oh you dont know

[MC Lyte - Verse One]
On the regular they guessin how the Lyte get down
Nevermind that, nigga you better watch your mouth
Keep snoopin and you bound to hit a brick
Get out the crack of my ass all up in my shiznit
To you nosey Nikkis and you Peepin Toms
So, you know Im about to drop the Brooklyn Bomb
7 and 7 is 14 , 1 and 4 is 5
But none of that matters if your ass aint alive
You could care less about the records I se;;
You just wanna know I tried but I fell
But even on your best day and on my worst
Ill still be first, without the need to rehearse

[Missy Elliott singing - CHORUS]
Why you up in my business?
Find somethin better to do
Why you talkin about me?
I aint say shit bout you
Forgive me for my attitude 
But I got something to say
Yall better not fuck with me 
Cuz Im had a bad day

[MC Lyte - Verse Two]
Yall must really think Im the host of the freakshow
Got me taggin piranhas I dont even know
Got me swimmin in waters, gettin caught in fishnet
Got me hooked up wit folks I aint never even met
Now yall so busy tryin to market this
I guess yo stupid ass forgot who started this
But Im about to ransack you make your memory
Come back to you, let all my true niggas jack you
Talkin bou the Lyte like you gettin paid for it
Better wish for your own and get out my business
Besides Im too quick and pigeons oughta know
By the time you get the info, it was two years ago
Aside from that Im too swift to catch
Dont pay to chase the joint, you cant light the match
And everybody knows Im too quick to flip the latch
It aint many that can even say they been attached

[Repeat CHORUS]

[Missy rapping - Verse Three]
I heard a lotta yall runnin runnin round
Aint none of yall this supa dupa fly
Supa Dupa as I
Fly, fly across the sky
Cut you like pie
Me and, me and MC Lyte
Cuz you wack
Straight from the jump, yea you wack
Better get back
I cant I cant fuck wit that
I aint sayin jack
Ima just smack you cross your face so deep that youll never talk back

[Repeat CHORUS]

[Missy talking - Verse Four]
Why you up in my business
Find something better to do
Why you talkin bout me
I aint said shit about you (uh)
Forgive me for my attitude
But I got something to say
Yall better not fuck with me
Cuz I had a bad day
Ficky-ficky check me out
Uh uh, uh (repeats through chorus)</pre>
