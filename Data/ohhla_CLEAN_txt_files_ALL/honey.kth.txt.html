Kool, Keith
Baby did you cook anything tonight?
What's in the frying pan? Oh~!
You made that salsa huh?
Oh that tastes good, put me some in there
Oh yeah, hold up, aight

Honey I miss you! {*3X*}

Woman explain to me what you doin, I gotta look at you while you sleep
It's professional when our lips meet
You're the main attraction, perfume smells sweet
Remove your panties off, catch your heartbeat
I can't babysit you, I can't stay wit'chu, every week
I walk you at home at night, listen to you when you speak
My mind on your sofa, what would you like to do?
I'm on your grey leather love seat
I feel your love heat, all your love sweet
Havin orgasms to my love deep
The nighttime visitor, booty call
Girl can you find a babysitter?
You talkin that one hitter quitter

It's all night, it's alright
Get in the back, do your thing
do it miss thang (do it miss thang)

I gotta cheer up your facial expression
You need your stress relief, a heavy sexual session
While hot strawberries bounce off your stomach section
Let me explain to you what I'm testin
Over the bra that cover your chest'n
External foreplay is what I give you all day
You already used to me shavin your legs and moisturizin your skin in the jacuzzi
I'm bound to find you, before you lose me
With cocktails and crystal glasses
I'm blendin to see, business girls from the financial district
I'm shocked, you takin me on a shoppin spree
You wanna let me come over unless a hater stoppin me
Turn that record off, he's floppin B

Honey I miss you! {*3X*}

[Kool Keith - singing]
Honey I miss you more, than, anything, in the world
Honey I miss YOU, honey I miss YOU
Honey I miss youuuuuuuuuu, more than anythiiiiiiiiiiiiiing
in this worrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrld
I miss you</pre>
