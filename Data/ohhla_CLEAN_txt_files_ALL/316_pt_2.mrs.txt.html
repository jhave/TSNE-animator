[Girl talking]
It's Murs bitch. Big ups to 9th Wonder baby. All the way to 2010, once again. 
They brought you another one and it goes like this...

[Verse One]
Murs, what up though? Still doin' my thang
Still not givin' a fuck, sold the game
In '04 showed you how to be a +Bad Man!+ on 3:16 
And I showed you +The Pain+
Had to +Freak These Tales+ up with +Trevor An' Them+
And I +H.U.S.T.L.E.+ the same
+Walk Like A Man+, spit like an +Animal+
Cause I'm a +Dreamchaser+ and I'll do it again
Huh, it's such a pretty ass world
And I toured all over and met some Silly ass Girls
And this is for those that +Love &amp; Appreciate+
I done gave up a lot of my old ways
I been sober, ain't been drunk in awhile
But I still won't hesitate to punch a punk in the mouth
The 9th Edition seemed hard to top
We got Revenge by goin' to the +Barbershop+
Change
It's funny how it comes around y'all
I'm still a maker of that underground raw
Shit
I ain't forgot that I'm a Legend 
And I know where I come from and I know where I'm headed

[Girl talking]
This is 3:16 Part 2. Like, the first one was so big we had to make a second one
And this is it. Back and better than ever. It's now or Fornever
It's not over though. Murs, you got this?

[Verse Two]
Friends done came and went and me and 9th still here
Kill 'em with that sound that you like to hear
Ends, be gainin' them, you have a right to fear
These beats are threatening, we are quite sincere 
The design of my flavor got me signed to a major
But now that that's over, it's time for the greatest
Haters, fans and bloggers
These are the greatest stanza's honest
Catch a nigga +Lookin' Fly+
I can make 'em dance to my shit
Toe touchin' on a stage, I can make those fans applaud it
Sweet Lord we done done it
But never in a day, from the soul to the stomach
The weather's feelin' great
We on the forth go round
Four albums in five years, this is how it goes down
Four albums in five years, how the fuck does that sound?
Forth album in five years, what they gon' do now?
Woooo!</pre>
