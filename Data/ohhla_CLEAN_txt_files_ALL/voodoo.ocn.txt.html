[Frank Ocean: repeat 2X]
Darker times
They're tellin boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize, voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun, voodoo
Don't let him see divide, mmmm
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo

[Outro]
She's got the whole wide world in her Juicy Fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands
His hands</pre>
