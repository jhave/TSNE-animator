[Intro]
Ladies and Gentlemen
Oh,oh, we like

[Chorus]
Got pussy everywhere
Weed in the air
I'm in my underwear
My under the underwear
Liquor everywhere
Condoms over their
I'm in my underwear
My under the underwear

[Verse 1]
Come on ma, I'm ready to get naughty
Don't act like you ain't know this a house party
Gangsta boo, and I know you ain't try to harm me
But don't worry bout it cuz I got the condom on me
Live in effect, yeah affect and live
I like ya style, mama I'll just take it in stride
Look in my eyes
Do I look like the type of guy
That run up on you and tell you a damn lie
Ooh boo I'm tryin to get it
Now tell me is you wit it
And if it's simple as that
Then tell me can I hit it
I don't go it it
do you go it it
You don't go it it
Thenn act a bull wit it

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
You 17, wit the ass of a women
I know you gettin Tipsy cuz the liquor keep on comin'
Lookin' right in ya tank tops and underwear
But ma I'm tryin to see whats under their
Oh, you like the crib
You diggin the gold shower
In the gold shower I'm handin out gold showers
Right now, I'm thinkin lets do this
17 dude, ready to ram I'm St.Louis
You wanna smoke a little
I always got a bag
But don't tell my mama cuz she always say I'm bad
Country wit my boxers and sneakers on
Right now my third leg need a sneaker on

[Chorus 2x]

[J-Kwon talkin over music]
Oh, now why is you
The only mother fucker in here wit yo, pants on
Ain't no other ga' got they pants on ma
I'm sayin naw I mean I'm not tryin to offend you or nothing
I'm just sayin' I-I'm tryin' to amend you or somethin
Man quit playin and take ya clothes off NOW!!!!!

[Verse 3]
Girl quit playin the party almost over
Ain't nobody old enough to drink
But ain't nobody sober
Finna take my whities off
You wanna match this thug
We can on the floor, or the mattress rug
In the bed I don't play
In 'em in trains
She said she wanted me to be gentle
Hand me this band-aid
Tried to give it to her rough
But she don't want it like this
But everytime I through a party
It just happen like this

[Chorus 2x]

[J-Kwon talking over music]
I mean this right here, this
This is true to life pimpin
You just can't put anybody in the lab and just tell 'em to go and they just stary pimpin
See it ain't been no big pimpin
It has to be small pimpin first
And uh, girl you lookin good but
You tryin to hold ya little clothes on and have to get greezy wit ya for you to take 'em off
You might as well take ya belt off cuz ya pants fallin down anyway
And when I say I'm wit the Trackboyz
And the Trackboyz don't step, they 2 step
And we don't short step we will step
And it's like that</pre>
