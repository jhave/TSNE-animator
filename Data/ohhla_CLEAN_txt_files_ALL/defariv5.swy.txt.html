[Defari]
Yo, I gets busy, throw a cat off me like a frisbee
He test me, now he's Gillespee, now he's Dizzy
Tiger strike pants, wear jiggy niggy
Rather roll wit family like Agony Tha Philly
Break my bucks for cuts to bucks Billy
Throw the nice Avirex on when it gets chilly
Catch the eye for dame holdin hands wit Willie
When it comes to hands I SLAP Big Willie silly
He says "Yo Defair my man, what da dealy?"
I say "Cat, you about as fake as Milli Vanilli"
Me? My whole crew we get lifted
Roll about as deep as the stars of the flag, fifty
It's like this, it's like that
Yo Chocolate Tye grab the mic cuz you swing a big bat</pre>
