(C-Rayz)
(Rain all dayz)
(Make it Rain)
Don't be a biter, Heifer
Why?
I'm the Chupacabra
You spit flames?
So what, I'm used to lava
Let's introduce the horror
I'm calm as brother
Throwin stray bars
And quasars
To harm a fronter
That's right
Right, Right
Cause I can't be left
And you spoiled MCs
Simply will never be fresh
Nevertheless
Less than forever is what to expect
Cause you rain all the time
It's just a nap in the birds nest
Beads of sweat form like rosaries
over my eyebrow
Then slide down
When I kill the stage in front of live crowds
To my little fans
Any bigger you'd be A.C
My slang bangs like gangs who hang in front
Of skate key lately
But it don't matter
It's like we all in the dark

'Cause of the spark
They thought you was
Gunshots in the park
Don't worry mommy they just rappin
Damn
He must have plans to wake up
All the mummies in Manhattan

I am trained
Flamin rain
Flaming rain
Raining flames
Raining flames
Reign forever baby
Raining flames
Raining flames
Flaming rain
Flaming rain
(Make it Rain)
Rain forever baby

My life
My life
Was hellified
I done ride that road of the chosen
A few has arisen
To shine bright in the night like
The rainbow light of a prism
I can make the incision
My decision is real
If I should let a snitch nigga ride
Should really be your grill
But since I'm in your whip
I decided to let you slide
I was tryna live cool
But cool don't pay the bills
And cool don't get my money right
Gotta stand out on my own
Puff my chest out like I'm grown
And fight that righteous fight
The simple words to be a man
Hey and
Stay as real as you can
From now til the day you die
And you too will live
You too will live
To say that you can reign forever

Fire flame
Flaming rain
Flaming rain
Raining flames
Raining Flames
Rain forever baby
Raining flames
Raining flames
Flaming rain
Reign forever baby

I'm a stick up kid of the worst kind
Wait
On second thought
Let me go with my first mind
Before I burst nines
Rehearse rhyme and raw truth
Forget sixteens from the eight
I show you what the fours do
I used to aim clappers
If you had chains like famed rappers
But I'm a changed man now
Your chain don't matter
A bag of magic
Slash in the trash with a hatchet
I kill verses on purposes
My notebook is a casket
To be serious with you guys
I bust metal flies and crush floors
Plus
You don't know me from the last Vulcan
You fucked raw
On instinct the next line would be
(Fuck off)
You stupid chickens ain't shit
Without my duck sauce
I scream down to the ground
And cause an uproar
The reason for this?
Well, the floors reflect Walz
Install my cingular wireless
To unplug your mind
For 9.99
You could add a line
The Angel from Anaheim
Feel Walz in Pantomime
Next time
We'll rock
On the block
In Palestine
I used to drink Ballantine
Till Wu exposed the Steelo
Now I'm thinking long range
Live relive with Steelo

My claim to fame
Flaming rain
Rain forever baby
Raining flames
Flaming rain
Reign forever baby
Raining flames
Raining flames
Flaming rain
Flaming rain
Mmmm mmmh
Reign forever baby</pre>
