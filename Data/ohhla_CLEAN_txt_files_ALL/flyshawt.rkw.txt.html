[Intro: Raekwon]
Yeah, yeah, straight outta jail
First time nailing me, realer than the obvious
They never said it was gonna be easy
Who can y'all put up with?
The streets... why you coming at me like that, man?
You payin' him? You taking care of me?
What's the matter with you, man?
See this the shit that make a nigga don't come over, man

[Chorus 2X: Raekwon]
Aiyo, fly shorty Penelope, fresh female chick
Straight outta jail, first time mailing me, God
Realer than the obvious, livelyness was on the line
I mean like, the sweetest thing, most seen her kind

[Raekwon]
Bloomingdale patient, slick finance who got a Benz station
Studying law, buying North Faces
Tried by the police, yo, straight up and down
I hold rollies, size six shaconies, daughter, might name her Water
Son, might name him Rich Porter, style, Law &amp;  Order
Copped them quarters, it's real, blowing out in Florida
Displaying a game, frame, I'm adoring her
Blasting music, I'mma lose it, shorty romance the music
Just grind, don't dance to it, flexin' with a sun dress on
Shorty refreshin', less you stressed, stop swarmin' on her
Yellin', it's all made basic, taste it
Anybody lace this here, you can blaze it
Rinaldo stepped up, what, "Lex, you know I got it lined up"
Bust ya gun from the side, what?
Take this thought in mound, your frame might be a dime
But the brain power might not shine
Shorty had a good head once, rolling up blunts, damn
She fucked up, got caught in the crunch
Now, down go her lifestyle
She on the FDR now, with a Audi J, bugging out
Stop that drinking, you wild, project chick, yo
Won't even tuck her chain, nigga, that's foul
Got caught up in the number run, dunn
I need to get my life back, son, share one
Lex laid it out, but she stunt, enter and still smoke blunts
Shit ain't real, she yelling "Fuck everyone"
Yup, caught up in the midst, I mean glitz
Went from doorags to rich, now he blue hat and switch
I guess, the live way to rap it, shorty went backwards
Now she stuck with a dirty Guess jacket
Keep on, giving out the jewels wrong
Who wrong? Who want? Who trynna-trynna act like you never knew wrong
Now it's raining, now I'm maintining, gaining
Probably gaming with positive aiming, long dane it
Stepped in, jumped in the car, fuck God
Put the Wisdom for Knowledge, you bond, whine too hard
Shaking her ass, walking out to the garage, you large
Fuck men, fuck who weighing nods
Stopped, took a peak at the stars, the Zodiac, a fine Mars
Or lose it for a chick behind bars
Wash, waking up Lars, aiyo collect call Taj'
Let's take a half a million in the cards
Laying up, at the Laborage, say I need a massage
Stressed, jumping out the Guess jumper, charged
Wifey material, make sure y'all observe the ariel
I'm mailing this through ya stereo
Wifey material, make sure y'all observe the ariel
I'm mailing this through ya stereo
Wifey material, make sure y'all observe the ariel
I'm mailing this through ya stereo</pre>
