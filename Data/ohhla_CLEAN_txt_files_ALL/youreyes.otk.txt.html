[Intro]
Hey...Uh Huh...Well Alright...How Y'all Doing? Yes Mam You're Mighty Fine

[Verse 1]
I've been around the world, seen so many pretty girls
But I still get over whelmed when I look in your eyes
Been from main to Spain but everything seems the same
I only feel the change when I look in your eyes
I know your upper class; I know you got those abs
Every man wants to kiss you, and I do too
Sometimes I'm just a clown, and everybody puts me down
I guess I'll come around when I look in your eyes
Tell me whats a man to do, to get close to you
I'm just a lonely fool, when I look in your eyes
Don't tell me no this time, if you do it will blow my mind
Have you ever seen a grown man cry? It's an awful thang

{Instruments playin}

[Verse 2]
I guess its time to say good bye, but I gotta give it one more try
I'm only satisfied when I look in your eyes
Oh please come home with me, oh don't you wanna marry me
I'm even gonna rub your feet when they stank OUTKAST!
How can I let you down, I guess I'm always gonna be around
I'm simply astounded when I look in your eyes</pre>
