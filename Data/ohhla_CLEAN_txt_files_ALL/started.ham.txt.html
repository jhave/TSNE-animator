[Chorus 2x]
Let's get it started!

[Verse 1]
Now your party wasn't jumping and your DJ was weak
Instead of dope beats, he was spinnin them Z's
All the fly girls who came with a beat in mind
They all up against the wall like a welfare line
Do you think for one minute that this is it?
Your party is bogus, Yo it ain't legit
You better put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started
Get it started!

[Chorus 5x]

[Verse 2]
Now get up out your seat because my beat is so complete
I'm movin everybody from A to Z
And when it comes to straight up rockin, I'm second to none
From Doug E. Fresh to LL or DJ Run
They say hammer how you do it? I got it like that
My posse's ever rollin, We keep it in tact
Just put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started

[Chorus 6x]

[Verse 3]
Now, a lot of b-boys make em dance, Yo they fakin the beat
They hip hop on the outside put rock underneath
Before the show gets started, They shakin they boots
My posse in the end cold displayin the troops
Like a trooper, I'm down cold hooked on the drugs
808 SB12'S are expirin africans
Just put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started

[Chorus 5x]

[Verse 4]
They said it couldn't happen, that rap wouldn't last
The beat is in effect like the oil in your gas
Cause it's makin lots of money from top to bottom
Whatever in effect, Yo, B-boys have got em
Nobody knows how a rapper really feels
A mind full of rhymes, and a tongue of steel
Just put on the hammer, and you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin, and you know I get it started

[Chorus 7x]</pre>
