I'm getting between your nerves like leprosy
Using mental salacity, my treachery trenches over centuries
I never meant to be reincarnated
Matter of fact if it was up to me I wish that I had never been created
The twigging swords hoards up in presto-boards walking through forbidden
doors and then with inside of the walls
People grimace when they witness business of the bloody instance
So keep your distance, the smell of bodies is covered by incense
I show no mercy blood splats up on my hockey jersey
Similar to fusiscions in rooms of emergency
So fuck the gats I'll rather hit you with the axe
Laugh while your skull cracks but I'm still not happy

(Chorus X2)

"All I really want is to be happy
To find a love that's mine would be so sweet"

I'm turning red blood cells into dead blood cells
Using microscopic utensils within your entrails
Pushing the limit of your chromo sols
Sitting on the throne made of human bones talking of mice up in a phone
I walk alone into pandemonium diarising plutonium
to build a bigger better stronger weapon
I sense the presence of great evil
so I erase and train every bit of the pabblesource conceivable
Reading about the beginning of ending
I'm sending the crucifier tending to your soul chrome accier
Within the fire I eulogise planets term in demise
Stealing energies and sending up, the planet dies
And nothing could ever really make me give a fuck about
Anything you care about so why even bother
The blood I spill could fill the entire New York harbour
So hang the Holy Father and light the candle lava

(Chorus X2)

I'm still be killing myself to live right
Could it even be it to explain the effects of the drugs on my brain?
Nothing positive could influence the truth I take
I'm dripping by the leg and dipody I instigate
Without a doubt the bloody body count increases. It falls to pieces
My mouth releases terminal diseases
And everywhere you look there's another dead fucking schnook
hanging from a bloody meat hook
I always keep a smile on my face
so I can hide what's really going on inside of my mind
I feel nothing and therefore I am nothing
I pry for on your suffering and there's nothing that makes you feel happy

(Chorus X2)</pre>
