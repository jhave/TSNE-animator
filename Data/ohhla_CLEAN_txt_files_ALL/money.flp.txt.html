Watch a nigga crawlin (ha)
Pay my money or you better keep you hall in (ha)
Dig up on my get money niggas so keep fallin (ha)
Cheers makin you happy keepin your bubble pourin (ha)
Gettin money on corners or even if you tourin (hoo)

[Rah Digga]
Niggas killin me , talkin that hope you don't change shit
Hell yeah bitch , from the door I get on some mad gear shit

Who the fuck type yellin , say crud sellin
Ain't said hi in years think I'ma pay they bail and
The 9-8 people get this right

Goin after ends , only keepin friends
Makin they own moves , drivin they own Benz

Stuck in low income homes blamin Clinton
Bitch like me , gon rock till my last batch of breath
With a grade full of ASCAP checks

CHORUS
Corporate niggas want my money gotta take me to court(addition)

[Spliff Star]
Yo
Spliff doin things , pursuin things , I'm gettin money
Chop the hand off the man who try to take from me
My guns go POW from Brook to Moscow
Tear a hole in your biddad for messin wit my triddad
Stack ones into lump sums you know the motto
See me on your block with Black Rob throwin bottles
I'ma a hard act to follow , love girls that swallow
So crazy I don't know where I'ma be at tomorrow
Yeah , I heard that money talks so I wrote this commentary
Every move that I make for sure is monetary
Our squad legendary , I'ma bump it till you hear me
Spliff doin love scenes on big screens with Halle Berry

Outro: Busta Rhymes
Ahee hee hee hee hee

Big business , allows young niggas , to comfortably eat
Every motherfucking day now , ahee hee hee hee , aight
Struggle process is now kept to a minimum , ahee hee hee
Yeah , I think I'm about to go buy me a couple of motherfucking sneakers , a

And a couple of bitches , ah ha ha ha ha ha</pre>
