(*talking*)
Yeah yeah, yeah, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
We bump that Screw down here, we back
It's part 2, Lil' Flip and David Banner, you know
This time around, you gotta feel us (got to feel us)
The album went platinum, fa sheezy nigga
Yeah yeah, uh-oh so just smoke something
Look, look

[Lil' Flip]
I still like to bang my Screw nigga, I keep it true nigga
You transparent, I can see through you
You a fake ass nigga, wanna hate on the South
Bitch nigga, get my nuts out your mizzouth
The Sizzouth, is where the niggas bizzall
Twenty inch Lorenzos, that's how we crizzawl
Go to the mizzall, and buy us some clizzothes
Go to the club, and try to fuck us some hizzoes
You know how it gizzo, I gotta keep it rizzeal
Platinum is my record sales, platinum in my grizzill
Bling bling bling, that's what a nigga like to do
But everywhere I go, I gotta represent for Screw
What about you, do you keep it real-a
Do you go half, with your nigga on some killa
Do you bang Screw, Fat Pat, Mike D
You know how we do it, we the S.U.C.
Screwed Up Soldiers, I represent the Clover
Last year I dropped my first album, in October
This year I dropped on, August 27
Nigga I smoke weed, like Snoop and Devin

[Hook - 2x]
What y'all wanna do, what y'all gotta say
You bump that Screw down here, okay
How you niggas acting, how you niggas roll
My album went platinum, my shit ain't gold

Ha-ha...</pre>
