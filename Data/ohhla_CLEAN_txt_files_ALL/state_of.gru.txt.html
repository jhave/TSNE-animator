[Common]
My mind blows decisions, at times indecisive
I think about the paradox that life is
Keep my head to the sky and understand who Christ is
Turn off the news cuz everyday is a crisis
Lifeless *niggas* on the couch weeded out
Its like LaDanians certain types of *niggas* out my life I weeded out
I believe in the route of soul before paper
No gold before labor, truth told with no glaziers
Days are getting darker quick
I was told it was written, Ima author it
Wanna go the same place that the martyrs went
The Black figures on the wall in my apartment
Like LaDanian yall I be charging it
Touching down with the people from my town
Its the Chi that be giving me my ground
Dug in the crates of my soul and I found, clarity

Chorus: Guru + (Common)
Be yourself, (yeah and be so clear)
Hey yo, just be yourself, (and be so clear)
So just be yourself, (yall be so clear)
C'mon, just be yourself, (and be so clear)
(repeat x 2)

[Guru]
Toiled in the trenches, faced judges on benches
Betrayed by some that I failed not to mention
Standing here now in the best condition
Up, outta the dirt so I suggest you listen
See money cant make you or me
Protect my mind with nines cuz it shines more than jewelry
Used to do things that werent too productive
Now I breathe life into mics for your comfort
I see past the groupies and goldiggers to find women
How I'm living? Doing me and not savagely driven
Taught the game of fortune and fame
So I'm not playing no more I hold the torch with flames
I've lost and gained at the same time
Mc's biting and swagger jacking still commit the same crimes
Once you see past the surface
That trash is worthless, with me you get a lasting purpose</pre>
