(*Jadakiss*)
(I'll be by your side) General
We got these niggaz, fucking cock-a-roaches
Wanna go to war, a-haaaa

[Big Pokey]
(I'll be by your side), like the gun I pack
When I sleep one eye closed, one eye cracked
Pitbull in the crib, keep one eye back
When Hector come around, I don't run out black
I'm right (by your side), when you need me nigga
I walk by faith, let the Lord lead me nigga
You can even be a hard, or a easy nigga
Rap need me, like George need Weezy nigga
I'm (by your side), whether right or wrong
Niggaz choke under pressure, like you lighting a bone
If a nigga try to test, yeah I'ma get this nigga touched
While I'm at the crib layed back, writing a song
I'm (by your side), like a guard and a tackle
Caught a flight to N.Y., went hard in the Apple
Don't be mad cause your broad, in the car with a rapper
Think I'm slow you don't know, I'm the nigga to be right

[Hook]
I love you too much, to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
By your side, by your side
I love you too much, to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
By your side


[H.A.W.K.]
Like Siamese twins, from boys to men
Like nine, sitting next to ten
Like Mexicans, waiting for that work to come in
The best of friends, everybody think we kin
Cause I'm (by your side), like a nextdo' neighbor
If I know nothing else, I know Christ my savior
Sharp as a razor, even through bad behavior
He was still by my side, like a two-way pager
He's still (by your side), like a passenger seat
Or some peanut butter cuts, in a fo' do' Fleet
Like bass to a beat, I'll make ya complete
Like a couple cuddled up, in between the sheets
I'll be (by your side), even toughest of times
What's yours is mine, every quarter nickel and dime
I spit these rhymes, so that we both can shine
Although sometimes, you may cross the line
I'm still (by your side), like Luke to Vaketsky
Hockey to Wayne Gretzky, or a fly and his pesky
And times to test me, the situation can get messy
I can kill you sometimes, but God won't let me
Cause I'm (by your side), like May to June
Or an unborn child, in a mother's womb
Or a minister, marrying a bride and groom
Or the stars in the sky, next to the moon I'm still

[Hook]

[Lil' Keke]
(by your side) like 4-5 holsters
From the jail mug shots, to the c.d. posters
I'm a bad boy, nothing like that Martin and Will
From the streets of steel, where they train boys to kill
So I'm (by your side), like the Secret Service
We some three time felons, white folks are nervous
Credit plus capitas, that ass monopoly
I know your every move, like the Paparazzi
Cause I'm (by your side), like a million man march
Pass the microphone, like the Olympian torch
It's back to S.U.C., we still holding it down
In the paint posted up, for the next rebound
Cause I'm (by your side), like Jordan and Scottie
Like H.A.W.K. and Fat Pat, or like Poke' and Lotti
When your mind get weak, and your body is tired
You can open up your blind, cause I'm sitting outside right
