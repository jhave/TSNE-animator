Song:   Roll it Up 
Typed by: InsaneD420@aol.com 

Roll it up then, confrontation 
Smoke it up then, heal the nation 
Roll it up then, burn the ganja 
I need to pass the roach because its burning my hand 

Let me take you on a trip, deep where I venture 
With the P-Town ballers in the city of Placentia 
What we gonna do? Fool I though you knew 
We're gonna fishbowl this bitch and roll the avenue 
Man I'm barkin, park so we can get this sparked and 
We'll score a fat sack and there wont be no more then 
We'll make a right turn, the shef'll burn 
Break out the two-four and put the bowl on turn 
We need to hurry up because my high's straight escapin 
We need a sixty roll because this bowl I'm sick of scrapin 
We're gettin low on herb, I found a twenty on the curb 
I got about a fifty, so Loc what's the word? 
Its some herb, we bout to blaze it (that's what I'm sayin), 
We'll score a fat sack and smoke till we're hazin 
Never perpetrate me because we just got lifted 
Saint call some freaks ,why me, cuz you're gifted 

Roll it up then, confrontation 
Smoke it up then, heal the nation 
Roll it up then, burn the ganja 
I need to pass the roach because its burning my hand 

Saint we got low cuz we smoked all our dough 
That shit was straight legit when I hit it I almost choked 
Man he broke, and too bad we aint no joke 
Two hits and pass that, man I want another roach 
The sad oversoked man I want some mo 
That shit got me tipsy I almost fell out the door 
Let me say times cuz that sucker livin' 
Shake in my somthin that fools start trippin 
What's a man to do when the avenues of life comes crashin down? 
It makes me think twice, with the j out your hand 
You aint nothin but a rookie 
Tryin to drop science but your mind is playin hooky 
Pay attention Loc, I only speak the truth 
Sing along with the song sendin out to the youth: 
Roll a man a joint and he'll smoke for a night 
Teach him how to roll and he'll smoke for life 
Roll a man a joint and he'll smoke for a night 
Teach him how to roll and he'll smoke for life 

Roll it up then, confrontation 
Smoke it up then, heal the nation 
Roll it up then, burn the ganja 
I need to pass the roach because its burning my hand 

Man I'm gettin stressed, I need to hit the cess 
I need to get some herb so I can calm my nerves 
Lets get some sinsemilla, its twenty a quarter 
Naw lets get some kind bud its willin to float ya 
Now check it out I get a twenty from my girl 
I get a quarter bag of the ? shwag that makes you hurl 
Look what I got I just got my double chamber 
We smoke it with a double, its clipped, prepare for danger 
And if a stranger wants to get a taste of it 
He can take a hit and trip and pay me for my rip 
I try to have two sacks in case one gets lonely 
There's a sign on my door that says bud smokers only 
Bud smokers only, bud smokers only 
There's a sign on my door that says bud smokers only 

Man I'm gettin hungry we need to get some food 
Man I need some chronic to get me in the mood 
Well hold up, my pager is blowin up 
Yeah that's X-Daddy, looks like we'll be rollin up 

Roll it up then 
Smoke it up then 
Roll it up then </pre>
