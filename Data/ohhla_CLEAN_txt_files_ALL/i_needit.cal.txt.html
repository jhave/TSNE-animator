[Verse One] [Black Milk]
Yeah, listen
It's about to get liver
Shit is hot lava
You can bring a hot 16, I can bring one hotta
Hot as the sun, ride out where the sun rise
Fly as the sky where the sun hides
I'ma
Spit a couple lines, spit a rhyme or two
Nah, when it's me and Lamont you can't do nada
Two beasts in the game, two true stoppers
Spit it like a beast, beast like a Chewbacca
? is so Mufasa
Move when you hear my crew stompin'
Hot, no shades straight through your Blublockers
Blocks hot like squad cars with the coppers coppin' a what? 
Yeah, still the most talked about topic
Talkin' to mags with the ads, talkin' to barbershop and
We can keep barkin' until they stop talkin'
More bite, bit 'em with a harder lock jaw yeah!

[Chorus] [x2]
You ain't gotta say I want it
You just gotta say I need it
B-Boys make noise

[Verse Two] [Bishop Lamont]
The entrance of I
Intensified
The English linguist, curriculum
Guess who the dean is?
Seem mistempered
Templar, knights makes the far sides gleam
It's so heavy
Like to call it Don John Gotti
Chain shines so bright it must be a member of Illuminati
Y'all don't spit, naw, y'all just slobber
Drools the best you can do, you Gerber baby's doin' nada
Me and Le' Shay Negro dope like Nicaragua 
Or coke on a boat, float like Spanish Armada
Move and maneuver over losers like Millennium Falcon
Album's hot when it drop, you know the outcome
Hater's like, "How come?"
Wish they could be down some
But since they not, try to knock and wanna doubt them
Spark beef, it's not a game I'm a rider
Got respect, ? , you obscene, should retire

[Chorus] [x2]
You ain't gotta say I want it
You just gotta say I need it
B-Boys make noise

[Chorus] [x2]
You ain't gotta say I want it
You just gotta say I need it
B-Boys make noise</pre>
