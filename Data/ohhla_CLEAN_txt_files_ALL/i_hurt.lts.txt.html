(Violent J)
I jump in a mosh-pit, but I'm alone
Between four trees I get it on
My brain is hemorhaging, it's them or me
It aint easy knocking over a tree
Pass out, I wake up, the room is padded
It would appear I've had it, but hold up
Clothes ripper, wrap 'em around my neck
And choke myself to death, no breath
Now I'm out, I'm strapped down
Wait, I can still move my head around
I got about 4 inches between the back of my head
And the metal gurney bed (boom)
Slammin' it, retractions
I feel the back of my skull is cracking
A broken bone is piercing my brain
And oh! I just hammered it in

(Monoxide Child)
I'm sittin' in the dark, talking to myself
Why does everybody tell me that I need help
I'm in love with pain, I take a needle or a knife
And drive that mother fucker through my wind pipe
Just might take a razor blade, dip it in some gas
See if I can take a little skin off the calf
Grotesque`, I'm a walking body bag
And when it all heals, I'll pick the scabs

(Blaze Ya Dead Homie)
Alone in the casket, buried in the earth
Self-inflicketed wounds, blood stains on my t-shirt
Kick at the door til' my legs fall off
Try to use my head but my skull to soft
The pain overwhlems, shootin' through my kidney
Blood rushes out when I stick the shank in me
Keep stabbin' and stickin', a wound opened up again
Cut off oxygen, take my own life again

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Why....tell me why...do you hurt yourself
When you know I love you? (Stop Me!)

(Marz)
Ya try to run up on me, and pull a piece out that belt
I smiled, grabbed that shit and shot my fucking self
I staple my tattoos on, see me close eye'd
Runnin' in the traffic, just to get my bruise on
An icepick through the head of my dick
I might slice up my face &amp; my lips
My main artery, is beggin' me
To let it float free, grab a razor blade, let it bleed

(Shaggy 2Dope)
A layer of skin, ooh, I pull it back
And smooth it back down with one simple smack
Wednesday nights I got kicked off my bowling league
Just 'cause I show up, bite a bowling ball and leave
Yea go ahead, curse me you faggots
So I throw my legs under moving cars, you got your habbits
I don't consider it hurtin' myself
It brings me joy, now shut the fuck up, here! (batter up)(crack)

(Jamie Madrox)
Cut and slice away with the steak knife
Hit myself in the ankle with PVC pipe
Exact-O-Blade, underneith the finger nail
Bleed and make another cut, fuckin' might as well
Table spoon of Mortan's salt in an open wound
If it don't burn you don't know what you doin'
If you fail, just return to start
Self-defecation, is a beautiful art

[Chorus]</pre>
