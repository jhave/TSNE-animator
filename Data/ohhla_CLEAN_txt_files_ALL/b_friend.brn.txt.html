Song:   Best Friend
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Whenever I'm down, I call on you my friend
A helping hand you lend, in my time of need so I
I'm calling you now, just to make it through
What else can I do, don't you hear my please
Friends may come and friends may go

But you should know that
I've got your back, it's automatic
So never hesitate to call
Cuz I'm your sister and always for ya and I

[CHORUS:]
I don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning to the end
You've always been here right beside me
So I'll call you my best friend
Through the good times and the bad ones
Whether I lose or If I win
I know one thing that never changes and
That's you as my best friend

Whenever I'm down
With all that's going on, It's really going on
Just one of those days
You say the right thing, to keep me moving
To keep me going strong, what else can I say

Friends are there through thick and thin
Well I've been told that
And I believe that it's automatic
Call me when you need a friend
Cuz I'm your sister and always for ya and I don't know

[REPEAT CHORUS (2x)]

I'll be there for you
When you're going through
wouldn't you be my friend
Friend you can count on me
Call me when you need me

[REPEAT CHORUS (2x)]</pre>
