Tell me what the fuck's goin' on y'all
We droppin' bombs up in this bitch!
Tell me what's goin' on!
Y'all better recognize
Psychopathic, droppin' bombs!

[Verse 1]
I will always keep my shit, underneath the surface
Because the way I flow, the mainstream don't deserve this
I'm set out to break backs on tracks
And scratch on all records that you spin on wax
I'm a crazy motherfucker with pride
And I got enough wisdom to keep my soul alive
So grab a mic and lemme see if it shine
Cause it's time to make this whole world mine, all mine

[Break]
Everytime I see these people
They always just stop and stare
Like I don't belong in this place
So they say that it's not fair
I can't understand this drama
That the Earth brings down on me
So let me take you through my mind
Look in my eyes, follow me

[Hook]
Tell me, what's going on
And drop these bombs on you
Tell me, what's going on
And drop these bombs on you

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna tell you why I'm dropping bombs
Because I'm sick and fuckin' tired of seein' fire alarms
Little explosions, marshmallows roastin'
Soft motherfuckers standin' on the stage boastin'
Now don't expect me to just walk away
Because I been told y'all that I'm here to stay
I'ma still keep flowin', from coast to coast
And I'ma still keep smokin' weed with juggalos
I'ma still bust caps, at all these hoes
And I'ma drop me a bomb off at every show
That's how it is, so just grab your bow
Because it's time to represent and watch these warriors grow

[Break]
I can't understand this drama
That the Earth brings down on me
So let me take you through my mind
Look in my eyes, follow me

[Hook]
Tell me, what's going on
And drop these bombs on you
Tell me, what's going on
And drop these bombs on you</pre>
