[Chorus: Baby + Jazze Pha]
I keep my rims - On the rocks
I keep my jims' - On the rocks
I keep my drink - On the rocks
That's how I'm living - +My Life, My Life, My Life+
I keep my briefs - On the rocks
I keep my platinum teef's - They on the rocks
I keep my bank - on the rocks
That's how I'm living - +My Life, My Life, My Life+

[Baby] + (Jazze Pha)
You see that silver satin ma' , thats beautiful daddy
I put them 22 rocks on that brand new Caddy
Y'kno AMG wit' chromed kit pipes
(Lord Lord Lord that's a beautiful site)
Aiy its a milli-milli nigga, milli-milli-milli nigga
Million blocks, million in rocks nigga, million cars
The Ro-Roc-Rock Boy, rock your ice and rock your toy
It's the Birdman daddy, no time na' pause
If y'kno it's gon' rain let it rock ya fall
Don't non come from top, But birds and ball
I'm grateful for the man that gave it all
But I rock my world and I thank the man
'Cuz I came in this bitch wit' my dick in my hand
Got that Caddy on broaders, block milla-walla
Nine-millimeter make the baddest nigga ball up

[Chorus]

[Stone]
My grill ma' straightened 'em all
Gucci - Gabanna - fuck the cost
Fendi - Prada - I burn it all
They been down we gotta ball
You Back it up - I'm loving that
I'm smacking up ya shorty back
Gambs' is up, better stack, I bought the truck
I covered that, Ghetto rich still lock them thangs
Money still in mansions man
CMB, 10 a ki' , wodie ain't nothing changed
But I still got my ghetto stripes
Red - blue and yellow ice 
That's all I rock, fuck the cops
They want me in that jail fa' life

[Baby]
Aiy, I'm Stuntin' tanight 
Whoo! It's going down tanight
Hmm Hmm, I'm popping come Crist'
I'm looking fa some hoes ta put on my list
Fits Tailored in the 'Vette with that platinum ass
That Gucci rag with the Bird in the bag
It's the Prada man, you prolly see me in brand new Jag
Gucci tailored, ma' don't tell me that

[Chorus]

['Lac]
Nigga, I went from big 'Bok shoes in Rolls ta 23 inches
This Cadillac so y'kno I'm pimpin'
Fo' insuran' I don't play that, I'm filled wit' begets
Riding through Eastover look that is where I stay at
I drive a Bentley and park a Bentley
Buyin' rims by the feet 'cuz they short on inches
Look I'm on the block nigga, off the top nigga
Go and cop nickels - something on the rocks nigga

[Baby] + ('Lac)
Look I spend my cash, Hood Rich (nigga don't ask)
Croc-a-dile interior, the platinum glass
22 inch buttons on that G-Wag
Got the mink on the floor, swine seats lil' daddy
I'm the boss of the ghetto in the '98 Caddy
It's big pimpin' baby, I'm Weezy Wee Daddy
Got the green pinky ring, the rock 30 carats
I keep it all hood, nigga check my status
