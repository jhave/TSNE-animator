Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I love this world
Girl
And this part
Girl, what you sayin?
Sty robots
Can we uh...?
Can we dance?
That'd be nice
Lose cool
Girl yea
Babe
Alright huh
Talk to you later I guess
Huh yea

Here we go again in the stars with
The flying cars and the Martians
Someone get my ray gun cause it's time to start this
Our beat's the hardest
Give me a star kiss
And it feels like a light year but baby girl I'm right here
I could die here
Let's start this party
Nobody started
And I'm rockin my card again
We could stop, we could start again
And in my heart's a friend and you knew it
(What are you tryin' to tell us?)
We had love and we threw it off the ledge
I'm off my head, my heart's obsessed
It's all my good

Then come near to me now, you'll have a good time if you know how to live right
I'm coming to get you
Oh you have to get ready cause it's time for lift off
Then come near to me now, you'll have a good time if you know how to live right
I'm coming to get you
Oh you have to get ready cause it's time for lift off

It's party on Venus
It's party on Venus
These girls are crazy
These these girls are crazy

It's party on Venus
It's party on Venus
This beat is crazy
This this beat is crazy

So dark with my shades
And I'm so under-aged
But I'm just tryin' to rage cause I
Can save the day

So dark with my shades
And I'm so under-aged
But I'm just tryin' to rage cause I
Can save the day

It's a party on Venus
High girl with the lowtops
It's a party on Venus
Pink hair which is so hot
It's a party on Venus
Why she left uh
Well I hope not cause...
It's a party on Venus
She's about to look for and trust but I won't stop
It's a party on Venus
We the cleanest and you jockers never seen this
It's a party on Venus
We the meanest and we lookin where the teams is
It's a party on Venus
We the dopest and this lane wide open
It's a party on Venus
And you're hopeless when it comes to the chosen one
No, we're not done, we the misfits
Mess around, end up on the hitlist
You can hit me back if you get this
You can put it on your wishlist cause
The stars are looking pretty tonight
We should get busy tonight
Kickin electricity night
We bout to dance in the stars of the city tonight cause

It's party on Venus
It's party on Venus
These girls are crazy
These these girls are crazy

It's party on Venus
It's party on Venus
This beat is crazy
This this beat is crazy

So dark with my shades
And I'm so under-aged
But I'm just tryin' to rage cause I
Can save the day

So dark with my shades
And I'm so under-aged
But I'm just tryin' to rage cause I
Can save the day

It's a party on Venus
These girls are
These girls are
It's a party on... crazy
It's a party on... crazy
This beat is... Venus
This beat is... Venus

Girl
I love this world
But still
And this part
I have no idea what you're saying but...
Guess what...
What you doing?
What you saying?</pre>
