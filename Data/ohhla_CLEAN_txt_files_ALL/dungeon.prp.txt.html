[Killer Mike]
(Screwed) PURPLE LABEL
So niggaz want to know the story
Why the label got changed from Aquemini to Purple Ribbon, shorty?
Where Dre at man? Why isn't him and Big on TV man
Them boys still down? Organized goin' through changes
All I know is that Big here, Dre gone, moved on
(Scratched) All I know that Big here, Dre gone, moved on
(Scratched) Big here, Dre gone, moved on
Changed names from Aquemini to Purple Rib-bon
My first album slept on, failed to do a mil
But yet and still, my babies haven't missed a meal
God damn, is there a curse on Dungeon Fam?
The Goodie Mob broke up, the DF album didn't jam
Before Lil Jon had the grill in his mouth
Khujo Goodie had the dreads with the grill in his mouth
And Bubba Sparxxx gave you the phrase new south
Like Cool Breeze gave you the phrase dirty south
Is it only me? Or does Pharrell sometimes remind niggaz of
Sleepy Brown back in '93?
I know its been like 12 Decembers (yeah, suttin' like that)
Let's remember "All the playas came from far and wide"
Yeah suttin' like that, talkin playalistic Cadillac
In the trap with +Two Dope Boyz+
Spittin Organized Noize via microphone
Do you believe The Source gave only gave 4 and a half microphones
They shoulda gave that a classic, ax Charlie Braxton
Damn man, I'm still amazed
The boys had the nerve to boo Big and Dre
When they hit the stage to accept the Source award
My heart dropped like a million other country boys
I thought my Mind was Playin Tricks like the Geto Boys
Damn man, I miss the interludes by Big Rube
He gave us knowledge that they wouldn't give us in school
So our mind wasn't so sick
Speakin' of being sick man I need a doctor
Which doctor?  Bring back the Witch Doctor
(Scratched) Feelin' me, bring back the Witch Doctor
Feelin' me, here's an interesting fact from me
When the boy Bobby V signed with DTP
He spit about blackberry molasses over Organized beats</pre>
