[ VERSE 1 ]
Now from planet to planet, and from star to star
It doesn't really matter, baby, just who you are
And from Earth to solar system, and to galaxy
It's real hard to get a ticket to hear Young MC
Because I rock like a professional, this ain't no lark
You either hear me at a party, or you see me in the park
I rocked the many places far away from my home
I guess that must be the reason why I'm so well known
I rocked from Iowa to Idaho, Canada to Mexico
I came into the place, you party people, just to let you know
My name is the Young MC, ladies want to come to me
And when they're in my arms, the ladies never ever front on me
Thinkin that you know the deal, boy, why don't you be for real
I love to rock the mic, and sometimes even rock the wheels of steel
Rock the place without a doubt, now I'm gonna turn it out
So listen very close, so I can tell you that it's all about
RHYMES

	More RHYMES
	Party people, I'm the Young MC, and I got RHYMES
	Let me tell you something 
	Young MC got more RHYMES

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now with a voice like this I rock so well
But I'm not Prince, Lionel Richie, or Patti Labelle
I'm not the Cars, the Pretenders, or the B-52's
My name is Young MC, and I'm the one you should choose
Cause when the music comes in, the beat starts thumpin
And I'm the only man to keep the girlies high jumpin
I'm the doctor on the mic, and yes, I'm so sure
That all you need is one visit, then you'll be cured
Cause in the game of rap I am the referee
When the others need help, they'll come to me
Like Judge Joe Wapner on the _People's Court_
My name is Young MC, rockin on the mic is my sport
And now you know, just from those 12 lines
That a fella like me never falls behind
Cause I'm the cream of the crop, and the leader of the pack
Once you give me the mic, you know there's no turnin back
Because I got more rhymes then the other guys do
They're just a monkey, I'm the whole damn zoo
I can't use a book, I use a hefty bag
Because they're just a string, I'm the American flag
I got more rhymes than water seen by a sailor
More than husbands of Elizabeth Taylor
More than Babe Ruth has hit home runs
Yo, my name is Young MC, so go out there and have some fun 
With RHYMES

	More RHYMES
	I gotta tell you something 
	Young MC got RHYMES
	Party people, I got more RHYMES

	Bust it

[ VERSE 3 ]
RHYMES - what are these things that I talk about?
Hear them in the walkman everytime you wanna walk about
Never lost a battle in which I fought 
And if rhyme was a crime, I'd never get caught
I had to go to college, because I am an intellectual
I only sleep with women, cause I am heterosexual
Rock the microphone anyplace, anytime
That's why I had to write a jam and call it Got More Rhymes
Now as a consequence of this
I'd like to make some sense of this
And tell the party people all the reasons that I sent you this
RHYME that I continue to say
School starts in September, graduation in May
And when I graduate RHYMES'll keep comin
Girls try to flock and jock, but stop bummin
Cause I'm the kinda guy that you never wanna toy with
And now you know that I'm talkin about the boy with
RHYMES

	More RHYMES
	When you say Young MC, you are sayin RHYMES
	Party people, Young MC got more RHYMES
	Yeah</pre>
