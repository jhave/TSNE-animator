Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Kevin Cossum]
Never had a problem when it came to pretty women
One thing about me never catch me catchin' feelings
Somethin' about you made me wanna change it all
Even thugs fall...
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Even thugs fall...
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Even thugs fall...

[Verse 1]
Thinkin' back in the days with the homies
We was runnin' them streets
Never wanted that love, she just wanted that D
Never ever did I cuddle in the bed  I gotta keep shit G
Never hug or kiss, it ain't me  never ride the Bentley on E
Pretty face with a body like "whoo!"
Good girl with a little bit of freak
Nothin' like the women that I meet
Yeah, she's special indeed
I was off the chain, I never thought I could change
Until I met the lady of my dreams
With your sexy ass and I swear you belong in some magazines
I got a thing for you baby... and it's more than the sex
See I'm talking bout love and affection
Never been, just show me directions
And she know she with a real nigga
No love for them other hoes
Tell her have that pussy ready when I get home
You already know...

[Chorus: Kevin Cossum]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Look what you made me say
And I love it when I'm in it all night
Throw it back, goodness gracious
And I ain't never met nobody like you
And you will never meet a nigga like me
That's guaranteed...
And we both got a thing for one another, baby
So tell me, shorty, what's it really gon' be?
I ain't never been in love, I ain't never had a wife
You can probably be the one indeed
I'm a fly young man
Need a bad little bitch who in high demand
Girl I can't even lie  even thugs gon' fall
And I need you, baby
And I want you, girl
I can show you things
We can travel the world
Now you drivin' me crazy
With them curves all over
I let her ride that dick
Like my brand new Rover

[Chorus: Kevin Cossum]

[Outro: Kevin Cossum]
I need you, baby
You made fallin' in love easy, baby
But it feels so good when you know you got sombody
Not just anybody, girl, I need your body
Even thugs fall in love...
If I'm a fiend, I'll call your body drugs
Girl It's you and me, can't let 'em break us up
Girl, girl I feel like I can't get enough (can't get enough)
Probably have my baby...
Probably have my baby...
Probably have my baby...
Probably gon' have my baby...
(She probably have my baby...)
Probably have my baby...
(You know even thugs fall sometime, baby, but it ain't no thing)
(Can't even lie you got a real nigga open)
Probably have my baby...
Probably have my baby...
Probably gon' have my baby...
Probably have my baby...</pre>
