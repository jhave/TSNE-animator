Can you feel me
Do that - do that - do it
Do that - do that - do it
Do that- do that- do it
Do that- do that- do it
Get on the dance floor
Can you feel me

[Diddy]
Yeah yeah yeah
Lets play a game
lets pretend for a second
you don't know who I am
and what I do, lets just put it do the side
I can feel your heart beating
I can hear you breathing
Look into your eyes, try to see into your mind
See into your soul
See no limits, to the levels me and you can go
When it's me that is in control
But it's something 'bout you that make me wanna change
I like the way you dance and the way you play the game
I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it, not saying a thing
The way you got me going got me goin, out of my brain
See us going at it, goin in and out of them lanes
I don't want your innocence
I don't want you to stutter
I don't want a committment
And I don't want you to suffer
I don't want your number
Baby I want you to wonder
Want you to come up lookin like it's somethin you wanna

[Christina]
Tell me
what you thinkin about when got me waiting patiently
Usually I don't have to wait for nobody
But there's somethin bout you that really got me feelin weak
And I'm tryin to find the words to speak

[Chorus]
Boy I got my eyes on you
Tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the mornin
I don't even know your name
Boy I need to know your name
I'm hopin that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know you gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you want it (tell me)
and you dont have to fight (you know)
Cause baby you're invited (baby)
I know you gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you want it (tell me)
But you dont have to FIGHT it..you know
baby you're INVITED.. babe

Tell me ...

[Diddy]
Ya dreams fulfilled, you rockin wit the best
Unforgivable, I'ma put ya limits to the test
You're pulsating, ya heart is beating out of your chest
You're hyperventilating, tryin to catch your breath (DONT STOP)
I'm the first I'm the next I'm the end
I'm the pulse and of course I'll make ya my thing
Look how I approach you, look how I expose you
Look how I've studied every move, now I know you
I don't wanna control you, I wanna console you
And do everything that I told you (I told you)
get high wit me, come touch the sky wit me
Fly wit me, see, like the new wiser me? (DONT STOP)

I'm the dream, I'm the one
I'm the reason you come, I'm a king
I'm a hum, im a beast
I'm the last thing your eyes see
the passion beside me is yours now come try me

[Christina]
Tell me
what you thinkin about when your hands is all on me
Cause I 've been thinking about all the possibilities
Ain't no other place that I really wanna be
Cause you swept me off my feet

[Chorus]
Boy I got my eyes on you
Tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the mornin
I don't even know your name
Boy I need to know your name
I'm hopin that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know you gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you want it (tell me)
and you dont have to fight (you know)
Cause baby you're invited (baby)
I know you gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you want it (tell me)
But you dont have to FIGHT it..you know
baby you're INVITED.. babe

[Christina again..]

Do that - do that - do it
Do that - do that - do it
Do that - do that - do it
Do that - do that - do it</pre>
