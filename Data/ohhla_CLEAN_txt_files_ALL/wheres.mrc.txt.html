Artist: Marc Live f/ Smoothe Da Hustler
Album:  Validation - Attack of the Grunge
Song:   Where's Your Hustle?
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: Marc Live - repeat 2X]
Where's your hustle?  Where you from?
What's your street rep?  What have you done?
I don't know you yet, you're not a legend
Fuck your block, you a regular nigga

[Marc Live]
Yo... this is my brand new debut
Welcome to my, twisted life, you'll risk your life
I grew up where the streets are dark
And - kids sell and go to hell in one night
And chicks snitch so quick, yo in milliseconds
The villains home invade, comin to get'cha
My whole level is, gutterest
Dead to rights, no strings attached
Uhh, but not the fun and games
Niggaz is backwards, I rip their backs off
Yeah, your team is not thorough
Studio kingpin, I'm pullin your ink pen
Stop writin (stop writin...)
And if you write in your head, stop thinkin
Stop talkin (uhh...)
You Sean Penn nigga, "Dead Man Walking"

[Chorus]

[Smoothe Da Hustler]
Nigga we shut shit down like the marshalls
Padlock and chain, dead cock, padlock your brain
Cats with keys/ki's get chased out the street
BAM!  Ran over by my man Landrover Jeep
I creep, stand over with heat
The plan, ran closer to handover your plan folder to me
So respect it, I'm deeply connected
I'm a survivor, three feet under the street wreckage
I side spectate, Cartier square look
Then Columbine everybody in the yearbook
Cats tellin me they next to acquire
But I respected, reconnected the wire, stupid step in the fire
I'ma do you fouler than Amadou
Roll past you slow gas you drop heat, and watch the fire follow you
Who sellin you dreams of cottonest sheet
Nigga I catch you in your nightmare and rock you to sleep, nigga

[Chorus]

[Marc Live]
Yo, you do regular things, you hug the block
Every weekend you hug the glock - sucka
You're too scared to, make it happen
I know killers that'll you make you happen - uhh
Look, you won't get it from rappin
This is real life, real shit - yeah
Real Desert Eagle, real people
C'mon yo there's just no sequel
Look, you a full time groupie
I'm soldier nigga, gone off looseleaf
Four star general
You know me, respect me, so salute me
Niggaz I blow the game up
Stop playin kid, I'll blow your frame up
And yo, you lame as fuck
I'm veteran, real nigga, get your game up

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
