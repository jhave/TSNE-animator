I, I tried momma 
I tried 
You lookin at me check yourself lil' bitch 
Mad at the rydas cause we all rich and shit 
Think about what you used to have 
And what you don't have now 
Trying to hate on me with a glass dick in your mouth 
Used to represent in Cleveland black trucks with the bumps 
Drive through the car wash now see you work and wash my shit punk 
You had all the bitches, paper, no trouble 
Now your ass is up in the air gettin banged out for pebbles 
I don't give a fuck it's like a horse with a broken leg 
An old crusty ass broken down piece of shit 
What's next? 
Next time I see ya 
I pull out my heater 
And meltin your brain with hot lead you muthafucka 
I can't take it no more 
I gave it everything I had 
Back on the bottom and everything is lookin bad 
Face mad cause I'm hungry and I'm broke as fuck 
I see your man on the corner and you know he's stuck 
He out of luck in the wrong place at the wrong time 
I give a fuck if he blind 
All his money mine 
On the dime I whip the gat out 
Handles slippery cause I'm sweaty 
He tried to move so I'ma pull this lead out 
Check his pockets loose change and a note 
Sayin I used to be a rapper I'ma joke 
Hooked on dope and I don't wanna live, damn 
Please somebody kill me and end this life big 
Back 2 crack I'm all fuckin tried 
Slangin' them dub tapes out the hoop ride 
I tried, I tried to be a hip-hop star 
But this rap shit didn't go far, go far 
Back 2 crack I'm all fuckin tried 
Slangin' them dub tapes out the hoop ride 
I tried, I tried to be a hip-hop star 
But this rap shit didn't go far, go far 
Hand me that muthafuckin crack pipe 
I wanna smoke me a pebble 
I'm through tryin to be a rebel 
I used to follow them hip-hop tours 
Handin my demos out at backstage doors 
I'm through trying to be the next Dr. Dre 
I'd rather just smoke this rock away 
Phoney deals, contracts, labels snakes everywhere 
Shit... 
I heard that niggas from the hood was goin way out 
Returning back to the hood servin fools like a paper route 
Scrounging up whatever loot they got to buy a key 
But if ranchers grew weed like record sales and popularity 
Back to the corner slangin loose and clumps 
Gotta live ghetto fabulous with rims and bumps 
Gotta have the fuckin heater cause my hands are stingin 
Coming back in 2's and 3's tryin to peel your cap 
Cause occasionally you serve a lemon head delight 
But you think them heads are stupid 
Cause it's dark at night 
Plus you gotta get yours 
By any means it's on again 
But you record slangin yayhoo 
How the fuck can you win 
Back 2 crack I'm all fuckin tried 
Slangin' them dub tapes out the hoop ride 
I tried, I tried to be a hip-hop star 
But this rap shit didn't go far, go far 
Momma, momma I tried 
I just, I just couldn't do it 
I mean, I mean damn you never helped a mufucka 
I mean, I'm sorry momma 
That's just drugs talkin momma 
Momma I'm sorry 
Back 2 crack I'm all fuckin tried 
Slangin' them dub tapes out the hoop ride 
I tried, I tried to be a hip-hop star 
But this rap shit didn't go far, go far 
Back 2 crack I'm all fuckin tried 
Slangin' them dub tapes out the hoop ride 
I tried, I tried to be a hip-hop star 
But this rap shit didn't go far, go far</pre>
