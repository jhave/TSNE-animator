[Intro]
Everybody knows somebody
That moves about like a misguided missile

[Verse One: Betty Wright]
Waking up in the morning 
When the night is broken by the day 
She needs to feed her babies 
Waking up in the morning 
When the night is broken by the day 
She's got to go home and feed her babies 
She sees no other way (other way) 
She sees no brighter day (brighter day) 
Up all night in the clubs and such 
She's 'bout the numbers, she knows that much 
Smiles though her heart frowns 
Can't get up for laying down 

[Chorus]
The word is what a good girl won't do 
Holly would - and the guys say Holly's good 
The word is what a good girl don't do 
Holly would - and the guys say Holly's good  

[Verse Two: Betty Wright]
Heart breaking with her head bowed 
Overtaken by the wrong crowd, that's her fight 
She needs to feed her babies 
Heart breaking with her head bowed 
Over taken by the wrong crowd, that's her flight 
She's got to go home to feed her babies 
She sees no open door (open door)  
Nothing worth hoping for, her baby's daddy 
up all night in the clubs and such 
He's 'bout the women, you know that much 
Goes to bed on the other side of town 
Ohh! That's what let her down  

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Betty Wright]
How did she get here? 
How did she get here?
Look at all those tears, she's drowning 
What a predicament, she's found in

[Rap Verse: Robert "The Messenger" Bozeman]
She was addicted to the street life
So she walked the streets night after night
Smokin the pipe, just to keep her hyped
Rollin the dice against her life
Lookin for the type who can pay the price
to keep her reputation nice
She was admired by many and yet despised by others
Even disowned by her very own sisters and brothers
So she hit the streets lookin for love
When times was tough, she started trickin, strippin in clubs
Got molested by her father at a young age
Taught her how to please a man, love him the right way
As he would say, "Nobody cares if you cry, baby
 It's not my fault ya mama never taught you how to be a lady"
And so she grew up confused by affection
Comin from the wrong direction in the midst of ?very? session
Everyday, another lesson, of a sexual abuse
This is the life that she has gotten used to

[Outro: Betty Wright]
She's got to cater to them, and she can't win, oh Holly..
Holly Holly... Holly Holly... 
I know you're somebody's sister (a good girl)
You're somebody's mama, you're somebody's lover 
Pocket full of money (pocket full of money)
Made the wrong way (made the wrong way)
Somebody, somebody got pray for Holly 
She's got no time for being a lady
Oh no Holly.. Oh Holly..
She got to feed, she wanna feed, she gotta feed, she need to feed
SHE got to feed her babies
Sorry, for Holly
So sorry, for Holly
But I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray
Will you praaaaay, for Holly
Somebody got to pray..</pre>
