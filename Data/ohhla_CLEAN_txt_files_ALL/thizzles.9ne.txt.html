[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Only ye, who is on the molly, shall dig this little diddy here
And if ye shall want that molly, then ye shall have it!

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
When I'm in the house everybody in the place know I got that
Ladies in the back, on my lap, I'mma tap when they pop that
I was on that molly when I copped that, but I never dropped that
Hey, hey (I got thizzles)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
T-H-I-Z-Z-L-E-S, in my belly, yes
We stay high, we be helly X'd, so don't be jelly, just
Get up in the midst of the party, got a fistful of molly and a bitch with a body
I think I wanna grab another chick from a hottie
Make her licked on my lollipop, I hits when I'm naughty
Hit em both then I'm 'scapin later
Never limited, dig it, I'm makin paper
Penny pickin, was sick, I was hatin fakers
Who played the great A, but they can't bust
I was-a-poppin, the panties was droppin
I never stopped even when granny was knockin
Super shockin when the be
It's off from all the rockin, insanity fuckin
That I does, my high buzz
The type of sky shove I love, I was

[Pre-hook]
(Poppin Molly Ringwald while, eatin Stacy Green raw)
(Everbody and things saw, motherfuckin fiend, y'all)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
M-D-M-to-the-A, on that plate, got me hella straight
We just took some dips, we just met, but we gon' fuck today
So pop that pussy for a goon and I got four hoes in my hotel room
Got a zip of that Marley and a fill of that Henny and a gram of that molly we about to go boom
Bitch it's Tech Nina and your boy Danny Brown
Hand-me-down clothes on me hand-me-down hoes
They be hoes on the dick doing fingers made of gold with a ruby on her head and a diamond on my nuts
Cumming on her butt for a pill with a slut
Playin with the pussy now I'm tryin to go fuck
So ho stop playin gon' let a nigga cut
Like a homeboy screamin ridin on the west side
Gon' suck a nigga dick or something
Gon' let a nigga hit or something
We rollin, rollin on the moon rocks we controlling, 'trolling
Up against the wall, all these bitches on my balls
Off that Molly Ringwald
Off that molly, brainwashed

[Pre-hook &amp; Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Orange juice
Morn' boost
Born goof
Scorn roots
Worn youths
Let my horns loose
Porn groups
With the E we raise the darn roof
Got it really hot in here
I'mma knock this beer, I'mma pop this year
Bet you think I'mma gonna stick and rock this rear
But big booty bitch, I love you, but I'm not sincere
Said you never popped before, I can't tell how
Cause you're freaky, you take it, you're going to hell now!
That I does
My high buzz
The type of sky shove I love
I was

[Pre-hook &amp; Hook]

Time to get your molly on! [x4]</pre>
