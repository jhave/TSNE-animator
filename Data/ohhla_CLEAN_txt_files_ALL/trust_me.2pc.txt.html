Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

I ain't got time for this, man I'm out

[Chorus: Dido samples from "Do You Have a Little Time", no 'Pac ad-libs first use]
You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by (don't you trust me)
Over here, at the side, of your life (it's not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
to have a little time for me? (not that I don't trust you)

[2Pac]
As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me
See you got me trapped I'm goin crazy this is slavery
You act like it's arranged, just give me space and we'll get better
And maybe we won't argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where you been and who you wit, I get no room to breathe
It makes me wanna leave, I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive, gimme grief when poppa leave
But to me, if you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts, that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support me that's what you're here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go to rest, I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
but I couldn't make it home, so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?

[Chorus]

[2Pac]
Callin at my house then hangin up, you think that makes sense?
Tell me what it takes for us to shank so we can be friends
It's time for us to take our seperate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good's become the past
Let's make it an even break, don't make it scandalous
Try and be mature, I'm pretty sure that we can handle this
You're sayin I'm too busy, I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I, cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me
Instead I'd rather break, hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but you're lyin
Fightin back the hurt so just start cryin
I'll wipe away your tears, come and hug me
I love you like you love ME, girl, but don't you trust me?

[Chorus]

[2Pac]
I hang up the phone, I can't bear to hear you yellin at me
Maybe we should end it, neither one of us are happy
You know that I'm emotional, you milk me
Comin over cryin just to get me feelin guilty
You and me were meant to be and yet
You always wanna sweat, how much closer can we get
Don't fret, just let me pack my things and I'll be outtie
This time I'm breakin out, you let your mouth overcrowd me
I can't take the beefin and the griefin
I get no room to sleep, I hope to see some cause I'm leavin
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
And I can give you more when you mature
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but SEE YA
And I hope you understand why I'm bustin
Not because we bust our love, hah, don't you trust me?

[Chorus]

[2Pac]
Don't you trust me?
It's not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?
It's not that I don't trust you</pre>
