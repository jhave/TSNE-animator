Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'
Come on, come on, come on everybody
Come on, come on everybody
Come on everybody, come on, come on everybody
Come on, come on everybody
Let's do this dance
Get out your seats and let me shake your pants
Oh, with the base cold thumpin' and the hihats snaren'
People are jumpin' and the fly girls are staren'
People under 40...Yo! Let's get down
Because they need more break and now it's sliced by Shay
The records out so don't wait

The style that I'm doin', it'll ruin
All you people came here just for booin'
Get your dead ass up and back on the floor
Jump in the groove and let Vanilla go
Insane, with my gold chain
You know you're gonna' see it on Soul Train. Hit it!

Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'..

All you people on thel eft, shake your thing
And everybody on the right, do the same thing
Now, the people in the middle, try to enhance
Come on everybody, let me see you dance
In motion, with the potion
Get up everybody and locomotion
All swing and do your thing
Unless of course, you can't hang. Chillin' is o.k
But not when I play this song, move along, be gone
Yea! The beat'll make you move when the records on
Get with this style and update it
Like my record is, when you play it
Def comin' strong, hard like a matador
I saw my style, my soul up on the dance floor

Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'...Do it! Funk it up!
Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'..

Swingin' until the night is through
Just let your feet and your body take control of you
Just like a trance to keep you movin'
Everybody can do it, just keep on groovin'
Of the 808...just kickin' like a chicken that you just ate
So catch a groove so we can get down
Yell out the name of your hometown
Miami...Catch the groove. L.A....Catch the groove
New York...Catch the groove. Seattle...Catch the groove
Dallas...Catch the groove. Detroit...Catch the groove
VIP dancers...Catch the groove. Everybody...Catch the groove
Do it!

Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'...Yea! Can we do it?
Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'...Come on everybody..</pre>
