Flip it wicked when I kick it, yes I can, Tip told it
  Stick it split, second rip it listen how I'm mold it
Lady you catch the notion of the potion
  Savor, the flavor, cause it's smooth like lotion
Cool keep it flowin on the level of this speech
  To play a war game, is somethin from the street
You see how I said it, now how is it is said?
  Do it backwards SO I CAN EFF UP YOUR HEAD
Hey you're up and, can I so backwards it do
  Said it wasn't hell now, said that I ha think you
Street the from somethin is game war I play to

Lotion like smooth it's cause flavor, to savor
  Potion the uh notion to catch you later
Mold it I had listen rip it second split, stick it told it
