[Intro: Killah Priest (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
(It's the hot shit, nigga!)
You know this beat is crazy, right (Hahaha, come on!)
This the beat right here, yo (hahaha)
They gonna love this when they hear this, g (come on)
(Yeah, Dirt McGirt and Killah Priest, hahaha)

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
A lot of these rappers r indecisive
That come into the game like y'all the nicest
But anyway get rich get brain
Get off the wall and do the damn thing
Get off the floor and do the damn thing
Get off the floor and do the damn thing

[Killah Priest]
Silly rappers when will y'all learn
U play with fire and U will get burned cause now
I've been low lately waiting my turn
Turn off my radio cause I'm not concerned with y'all
Weak rhymes same topics
This one for the street for the projects
For my G's with the weed in the apartments (uh)
For my dogs in the law hit with charges (Killah Priest)
Fuk them cause I luv y'all regardless
For my chicks in the whips dancing braless
Hair done nice face looking flawless
I got the thing bust off lead objects
Y'all cats r lame no threat it's a promise (blaze)
Name your favorite rapper well he's fake
And U fake that's why U fuk with his tape
I'll take that thing and just bust in your face (come on, come on)

[Chorus : Killah Priest (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
A lot of these rappers are indecisive (come on! come on!)
They come into the game like y'all the nicest (come on! come on!)
But anyway get rich get brain (come on! come on!)
Get off the wall and do the damn thing (come on! come on!)
Get off the floor and do the damn thing (come on! come on!)
Get off the floor and do the damn thing (come on! come on!)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
I'm on the streets ringo, spendin' the spingo
Eazy-E lingo, you doin' the tango, the vet don't wear Kangol
I dare pump my shit out the club, actin' strange, yo
Smack y'all niggaz in yo face, yo
Got wiggas in the place, yo, by partyin' this muthafucka
I'm the only round lookin' sucka
I watch ya birds clucka, I'm free to ya tucka
So hold up, I'll play this muthafucka!
I'm on the other side, sportin' the vibe
I'm like college to this bitch asshole then vibe, slide!
Enter tah, with ya asshole movin' like hah
So don't ever let the shit break ya soul
With the drunk shit I will take ya soul
I move with mad heat and smoke you in ya head, man
This shit war, sign my tape man, take man
I'll blast you in ya muthafucka face
Smoke you in ya muthafuckin' face!

[Chorus]

[Hook: Killah Priest]
Cause it's a new year besta come correct
I ain't heard a style that I can't do yet
I ain't hear a rapper that I can't move yet
Get off the wall and do the damn thing
Get on the floor and do the damn thing
