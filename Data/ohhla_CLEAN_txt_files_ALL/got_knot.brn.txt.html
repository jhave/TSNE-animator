Yeah.. put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) uhh, got a knot
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) yeah
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket)
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) uhh

Y'all know what time it is, let's get it crackin
Push up on a shorty, no slackin, just start mackin
Lay yo' shit down, baby ain't no time to clown
Takin Southbound but I turn around where it start gettin brown
I ain't no dooty hound, shit I lay my duty down
Pound for pound, Brand Nu one of the best around
I put like 20 some odd years up in the projects
Gourmet chef with welfare cheese before these record checks
I used to steal my mom's whip, sneak up in the club
Get back to the parkin lot, the next door neighbor jacked my spot
Ahhhhhhh... shhhhit...
... excuse me miss you got to move your car
And I took a dub before I stole {?} shit
That's all I need now for her ass to really flip
I'm 2 strikes and 3 quarters from a pink slip
I'm glad I'm makin hits, y'all know the chorus, sing this shit

(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) yeah
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket)
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket)
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) uhh

[Sadat X]
Morph into somethin terrible, my presence unbearable, parable
A spittin Bronx legend like Larry Davis
Make police think about it on they routine tours
Through the war's lifestyle, hell scene, shells and void sales
Avoid bails, avoid jails, I'm four-eyed
Who's ridin who inside?  Who say they know me
I give great, atmosphere, like a open bar
You got to scratch and claw, you tryin to match the star
Hit me on my cellular, six for my dick
My man is on the phone cryin over some chick, yo call me back
My exact measure make the world my treasure
And since we only live once the world's my pleasure, who want booze?
Broads, dice game and cards
Houses with yards, feel the blast from the glass shards
Who got colored bags, who got colored rags, straight brims for ya block
Be from {?} in pairs
I move these crabs out my life like they musical chairs

(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) yeah
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) raise ya hands
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) if ya gotta knot
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) if you want a knot

[Lord Jamar]
Now I don't lust over money
But if I had to do it, I would bust over money
Let's not have a dispute and cause disgust over money
Cause we can cut and shoot and shed the blood over money
but that wouldn't be right, yo
Gotta have some, money in yo' pocket
How the fuck you 'sposed to hit the supermarket?
You can't even get the stain out your carpet
without havin little money in your pocket
I know you wanna get the chain with the locket
Buy a plane so you can sit up in the cockpit
All day gettin brains from a hot bitch
Layin back, spendin change on a ostrich
Or would you settle for just gettin out the projects
Pay off your debts, make a little progress
Either way the only thing that could stop it
Is not havin no, money in your pocket

(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) got a knot
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) want a knot
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) need a knot
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) uh-huh
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) got a knot
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) want a knot
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) need a knot
(Got a knot, knot up in the pocket) yeah</pre>
