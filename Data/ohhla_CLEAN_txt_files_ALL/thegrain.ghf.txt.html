[Man]
Do you wanna see it?
Do you wanna see it?
I'm gonna do it for ya
I'm gonna do it for ya
I'm gonna do it for ya
I'm gonna do it for ya

New Ghostface!

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo deep in the trenches
Wig, young black green beret
Chrome laser guns blazing at spades
Wallabies, cherry noose, kool-aid
10 niggas call it Tai-Chi
Black blades, one hundred dollar seats
Hold up, we at the opera
Queen Elizabeth rub on my leg
Had ketchup on her dress from a whopper
Chunky ass necklace
Must be her birthstone
John Paul cop the biggest stones outta Rome
Told ya eyes up on her prince
Fucking with Diana
Two rows across, Dirty giving hickeys to Vianna White
Fingering Pamela Lee
We on the balcony
Dare one of ya'll to Malcolm X me
Somebody might catch a Kennedy 
Yo let me adjust my lens 
Through these binoculars
I paid 5 g's sliding off like Kid Vitamin 
Viking
Patriot of Broad Street
Bet you think I'm laying like a hyphen

[RZA]
Tony Starks make the narc's dogs bark
With the Benz parked
Up against the boulevard
Starks had the bone sparked
One cop tapped the window glass
Like a cymbal crash,
"What the fuck son! You trying to break glass?"
He flashed his badge,
"License and registrations"
At that moment 
His fat partner started chasin'
Chicken heads they was racing wit' they hearts pacin'
For snatching gold
Trying' to dip into the god's basement
Our location
Lead steel shed spread
Cracked shorty head
Left sweetie there for dead
Ghetto poodles
Fingers sticky from cheese doodles
Starving' for a 50 cent bag of Oodles and Noodles
Neighborhood sick wit' it
Clinton 'bout to cut WIC
Maybe one ya'll rich rap niggas need to politic
Reach for the sky 
They throw bleach in your eye
Don't teach you why
You be keeping 'em high
Dipped like an Oreo cookie 
In cold milk, bold silk 
Gold-filled cap, Wu wear hat, 
Low tilt
True Islamic 
We speak verbal rhyme phonics
Why ya'll trying to change this hip hop to technotronics?

[RZA]
Don't go against the grain (the grain)
Don't go against the grain (the grain)
Don't go against the grain (the grain)

[Ghostface]
Girl!

[RZA]
Because of you I'm hurting
Within my within my heart
I know it's not right to be flirting
But a relationship has to start
You're the one that I'm clocking
It's time for you to start jocking
Don't want you to see me cry
This is why this is why this is why

[RZA]
I met this girl named Rhonda from way down yonder

[Ghostface]

[RZA]
I met this girl named Liz she was all in the biz

[Ghostface]

[Ghostface]
