Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This is what happens when you have so many bitches
You get depressed and go insane
Oh my God based God, yeah

I got bitches, this real bitch music
Fuck hating suckas I got the girls to prove it
My bitch look good, she the same as color as a buick
Fuck is you doin'
Them bitches ain't choosin'
They love the Based God, the bitch is not a groupie
I met the Based God and no he's not stupid
He said he'll tie me to a tank of propane (The Game)
King of the hill Based God, bitches call me a-rod
Ask me 'bout the clique man, Bitch Mob
Lil B is in Bitch Mob
Based God supports the Bitch Mob
Everybody know that Based fucked my bitch huh
Everybody know that I still rep the clique huh
Shout out (laugh) (meh)
Man she still suck my dick huh
Young Based God, I gotta beautiful bitch mob
Watchu' wanna do boy, I still fuck your bitch...
Scuba diving swag and the Based God the ruler yeah
