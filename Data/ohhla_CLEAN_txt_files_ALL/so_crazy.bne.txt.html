[Kelly Rowland]
You're so good, cause I got you
Hold you down, boy, I gots to
So secure, when I'm with you
Your love is so
Crazy
I know my girls would try to diss you
But they ain't 'round when I'm with you
But I don't care cause it's official
Your love is so
Crazy

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone] + {Kelly Rowland}
I hear that they goin' through dramatics with your friends and your family
Catchin' him runnin' around with Krayzie, they just ain't understandin' me
Probably because I'm from the streets and I was born a thug
And I done been around the whole world, met a lot of the wrong girls
Well baby girl, you need to tell him (Just tell him)
The Thuggish Ruggish
Love to gettin', ain't lovin' no better, we gon' be down forever
Look
I know your friends sometimes go run
And tell you things
You can come to me, I tell you everythang (Everythang) {Yes, they do}
Because it's all real (It's all real)
What you see (What you see)
This is on me (This is on me)
Everyday (Everyday)
But I'm not tryin' to rush, I take ya time
Real niggas is hard to find, here, we're hard to find {Baby, you're hard to find}

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland] + (Krayzie Bone)
You're so good, cause I got you (I got ya)
Hold you down, boy, I gots to (You know you got to)
So secure, when I'm with you (Don't worry about a thing, babe)
Your love is so
Crazy (Crazy, crazy)
I know my girls are tryin' to diss you (They got issues)
They ain't 'round when I'm with you (I'm with you)
I don't care cause it's official (You know we got the good thing)
Your love is so
Crazy (Crazy, crazy)

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone] + {Kelly Rowland}
I'm a always be your shinin' armor, I'm a help you down through the drama
Little mama, you hold the key to my heart (To my heart) {My heart}
I feel so special to be around you, wish right now, you could be around me
You'se the one that kept it real from the start (The start) {Yes I did}
Probably have big dreams, live a better life, you came along, for the ride (Ride)
You was confident, that I get it right, you would stay right here, by my side (Side)
But thangs got crazy
You was there for inspiration
When the popo hand in there
You was there for visitations
(???) vacations ruin the nation
But that's why they can't infiltrate it
Only reason your girlfriends hate it, cause they wanna be switchin' places (Places)
So many different smilin' faces go and come (Come)
But a real woman is hard to find, so baby girl, you the one {You're so good}

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Wish Bone] + {Kelly Rowland}
You need to get him out your business, let him know who you kissin'
Let him get inbetween us
Do you know what you missin'?
Baby girl, don't sleep
You can ride with a thug
And I don't play cheap... {Play cheap}
Not thirsty, but you can thug like you can sleep (Sleep)
Just ride with me, if I ain't got it, you can fire it up, for me {Ride with ya, baby}
If it's live right, die for me (For me)
Police askin'
Lie for me (For me)
Get it right, right here
Sky with me (Sky with me)
Ride with me (Ride with me)
We can go where you wanna
Hit the spot just for lovers
With my lady (Lady)
Keep it sexy (Sexy)
Never undercover, that's my baby (Baby) {Feel so good}
