B-Boys, fly girls, throw your hands in the air
Ah yeah, like you just don't care
B-Boys, fly girls, throw your hands in the air
Ah yeah, like you just don't care
B-Boys, fly girls, throw your hands in the air
Ah yeah, like you just don't care

Old school sounds, gun down blastin'
All the homies in the house, you know they be maxin'
Coolin' out with style like back in the days
Representing the skills, putting suckers in their place
Funky fresh, I'm with the most finest
DJ got a record so you could impress
All the fly girls, yeah, the sexy ladies
See, ain't no doubt about what's happening later

B-Boys, fly girls, throw your hands in the air
Ah yeah, like you just don't care
B-Boys, fly girls, throw your hands in the air
Ah yeah, like you just don't care
B-Boys, fly girls, throw your hands in the air
Ah yeah, like you just don't care
B-Boys, fly girls, throw your hands in the air
Ah yeah, like you just don't care

Two turntables and a microphone
That's all we need to rock on the show
Bam bam bam, are you ready for yes yes yalling
Get your funky ass up, this is the last calling
Funky fresh, I'm with the most finest
DJ got a record so you could impress
All the fly girls, yeah, the sexy ladies
See, ain't no doubt about what's happening later

B-Boys, fly girls, throw your hands in the air
Ah yeah, like you just don't care
B-Boys, fly girls, throw your hands in the air
Ah yeah, like you just don't care
B-Boys, fly girls, throw your hands in the air
Ah yeah, like you just don't care
B-Boys, fly girls, throw your hands in the air
Ah yeah, like you just don't care</pre>
