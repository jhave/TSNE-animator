When I went around the block people was lookin at me
My friend asked me why I'm so unhappy
The reason was because you wasn't with me
There to hold, love and to kiss me
But now since you're back from school
Let's go to my house and break a rule, baby
Cause the night is young
And you ain't dumb
So please gimme some
Of that yum yum, baby

You tell your girlfriends that you hate my guts
But if you hate me so much
Why did you kiss me last night?
You kissed me once, you kissed me twice
You put your hand on my knee when I was cool as ice
And jumped up from the sofa to fix me a drink and
The room got heated, and I knew what you was thinkin
Takes two to tango, but not me and you
Cause you're the kind, if it ain't right, you'll sue me
For all of my possessions and my privates too
So the only thing that you can do
Is gimme some yum yum, gimme some
Gimme some of that yum yum, baby

Now you tell everybody that you're not my sweetie
But you're all in one, nice, tall and meaty
So gimme a chance and, girl, you'll see
That after one night, ooh baby, you'll love me
So if you change your mind, please let me know
Because sky is the limit anywhere we'll go
And we'll have a ball, baby, if not have fun
And in the process have a daughter or a son
Don't unestimate me, appreciate me
Cause I been feelin the need for love lately
The night is young and you ain't dumb
So gimme some of that yum yum, baby

You can come to my house, lay down and go to sleep too
It been a while, you'll see what I wanna do
I do it to the left and do it to the right
And if possible make love all night
I want yum yum, gimme some
Gimme some of that yum yum, baby
Ice cream and cherries too
Put all of them together, and it's sweet as you
Not needing to tell me and you
You can't help yourself, so what ya gonna do?
You tell your mother and your father
Sister, uncle and your friend
A couple other people that are not your kin
About the yum yum, gimme some
Gimme some of that yum yum, baby
Yum yum, gimme some
Gimme some of that - ooh baby

I went around my block, people was lookin at me
A friend asked me why I'm so unhappy
But now since you're back from school
Let's go to my house and break a rule
Baby, the night is young, and you ain't dumb
So gimme some of that yum yum, baby
You tell everybody that you hate my guts
But if you hate me so much
Why did you kiss me last night?

You know what, girl?
It's been a while
Since I had some real good lovin
But I don't know why you give me such a hard time, baby
I admit you're cute
Okay - you're fine
But baby, you're not worth it, man
That's right, I say 'man'
Cause that's the way you act sometime, you know

Yum yum, yum yum
Why don't you give me some
Yum yum, baby
Yum yum
Gimme some
Gimme some of that - ooh baby</pre>
