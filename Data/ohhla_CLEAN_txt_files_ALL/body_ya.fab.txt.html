[Intro]
{R.I.P. to the competition}
Uhh, the funeral, yeah
(Aowww~!) I got 'em
(Aowww~!) Uhhhhhh

[Fabolous]
Shout out to my enemies, shout out my competitors
Shout out to my Mini-Me's, I hope you do better bruh
Better me, better you, et cetera, et cetera
Shout out to the followers, I will stay ahead of ya
Big up to the haters, big up all you little niggaz
Biggin y'all up should make you feel a little bigger
Big up to the fake niggaz from a real nigga
Fake niggaz help you recognize the real niggaz
Uhh, I'm a Brooklyn nigga any how
Closet looking like I opened up for Vinnie Styles
Bitches say we are the best
So mami in my jeans, P-R-P-S
Yeahhh! Street Fi-da-di-da Gang
Yeahhh! @ you like a Twitter name
Same place I see 'em, same place they chalk 'em out
We speak Guapanese, come see what we talkin 'bout

[Chorus: Fabolous]
Holla at your homey, holla at your dog
Lookin for the competition holla at the morgue
Once I say hi to her, she gon' say bye to ya
If looks could kill then my style might body ya
B-b-body ya, b-b-body ya
If looks could kill then my style might body ya
B-b-body ya, b-b-body ya
If looks could kill then my style might body ya

[Fabolous]
Yeah..
A shout out to the groupies, shout out to my ex
Probably sayin fuck me so shout out to the sex
Don't get mad at me cause I'm onto the next
All of this because I ain't respond to your text
Big up to you bum bitches in your ten dollar dresses
Big up to the big girls y'all are so +Precious+
Salty bitches try to raise a nigga blood pressure
Grown little girls, do your mouth get any fresher?
Huh~? But it ain't fresh as 'Loso
Monogramed out son in case you didn't know so
Flow so deadly, swag too murderous
Known for bein nice, that don't mean courteous
This is nothin new, I'm not a beginner
I get big checks like the lottery winners
A boy dissin I, boy listen I
kindly sent him on his way, tell the mortician hi

[Chorus]

[Outro: Fabolous]
What it look like nigga?
It's Young Funeral (it's me)
Told y'all niggaz I got this (I got this shit nigga)
There Is No Competition 2 (the funeral service)
Whattup Dram'? What it look like? (uhh) Huh?
What we talkin baby? (What we talkin 'bout?)
These niggaz is dead (What we talkin 'bout?)
Yeah I said it, dead (hahaha)
Nice.. niggaz might as well lay down in the hall
and throw dirt on theyself
It's Funeral</pre>
