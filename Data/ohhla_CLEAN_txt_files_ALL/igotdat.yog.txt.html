Song:   I Got Dat Sack
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Bitch I'm Sacked up
Bitch I'm Racked up
Bitch I'm Stacked up

[Verse 1]
I Rock Gucci, Louis, Prada
Niggas know I shop at Saks
Yellow bone super fine
Know I'm hittin' that from the back
If you see me in the club
Niggas know I got that strap
Security tried to search a nigga
But we comin' thru the back
See the sparklers in the air?
You know them bottles on the way
CMG takin over mane
That's all the DJ play
Right on, right on in the club with my white on
Shawty got something tight on
And if that's your bitch then you might have to fight homes
Gripping on her ass, niggas say I'm disrespectful
I pulled up in that lamb, niggas say I disrepected 'em
If I'm wanted then I'm running fast, know they gotta catch me
Niggas shot at me and missed
Oll the lord blessed him
I sell dope, I fuck hoes and make songs 'bout the shit
I rob niggas for they work and don't feel wrong 'bout the shit
You a pussy ass nigga, you don't belong with no bricks
I pop pills, I feel good, I mix patron with the shit

[Chorus]
In the club goin' hard, Niggas know I got them racks
In the kitchen whippin' hard, Niggas know I got that sack
In this bitch goin hard, Niggas know I got them racks
In the kitchen whippin' hard, Niggas know I got that sack

[Verse 2]
Niggas standin' on the couches, throwin' signs on the club
V.I.P. Bitch I don't wait in line at the club
It's a photoshoot, fed takin pictures in this bitch
I'm a nice guy, buyin bitches liquor in this bitch
Got my fam with me, plus my nigga zilla in this bitch
I Don't Give a Fuck I'm back on my Ridgecrest shit
Yellin "Thug Life", Niggas on that 2Pac shit
Minnesotta twins bitch I'm on my two Glock shit
You niggas screwed up, put you on ya news box shit
Body found by the river, feed it cement bricks
Eww she nasty, she just had a semen dish
She suck the skin off the dick you should've seen this bitch
They say I'm nasty, I think I'mma clean this bitch
Shawty suck it so good, think I'ma clean this bitch
SIKE! She not the type to be a wife
She get her pass, for the night

[Chorus]
In the club goin' hard, Niggas know I got them racks
In the kitchen whippin' hard, Niggas know I got that sack
In this bitch goin hard, Niggas know I got them racks
In the kitchen whippin' hard, Niggas know I got that sack</pre>
