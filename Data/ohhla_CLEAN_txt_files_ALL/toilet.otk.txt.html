Have you heard the news? 
They say a little 14 year old little girl had a baby on the way
Tooo much for her little mind to bare
And that type of news to her mama she cannot spare

*Hook*
Toilet Tisha, damn we miss ya
Toilet Tisha is the issue
Damn we miss ya, Toilet Tisha
Damn we miss ya

*Vamp*
Dont go away 
Dont you dare go away from me girl I can help you
Dont go away dont you dare leave me
Dont go away, away 
Dont go away

*Big Boi*
Five thousand, one hundred ten days
Is a short period of time a mere fourteen years
On this precious mother earth, you see Tisha had issues
And her decision making skills were still in its early stages
You know what I'm talking about 
Therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which 
She thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood
Pause, Just like a brother with a thousand pauses
Should I shouldnt I I cant I have to, mama will never see me the same
Daddy and Big Mama I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me
Are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium
As she sits on top of the pale, cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house
The unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue
And no way of expressing her feeling to her mam or anybody else in her life
Tisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose
Fatality, fatality, fatality, fatality</pre>
