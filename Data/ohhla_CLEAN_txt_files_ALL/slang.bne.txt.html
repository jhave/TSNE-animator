I87 is a lesson for them niggaz
that want to test
bring more than cause me shotgun
will be buckin your chest
wanna be Mothug thugsta menatatlity
runs through the BONE
pop pop to the dome
fall short to the crome
get wraped that bitches on
much love for the green leaves
but me trues have to ease me down
puff puff head rush
popin in me clip and I got plenty rounds
me n pretenda
no studiothugsta
BONE'll get wit cha
straight #1 lil' rispsta
swing watch him hit cha
so we can swang(we can swang)
down for my thang(down for my thang)
finna blow to tha brain
though you could hang
when I swang them things
thats insane
stay low (so low)
dem popo know me no surrender
dem niggaz on tha street they remember as beeing no pretenda
standin up on tha block
9 mm cocked
and me hang, and me gott my niggaz lookin out for me back
and them watch for them rocks
and you know its nuthin but the neighboorhood thang
its manditory for me neighboorhood slang</pre>
