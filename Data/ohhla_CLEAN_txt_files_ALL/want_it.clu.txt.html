New hit Fabulous straight from Desert Storm
Whaaaaaat!

I don't understand how niggas insist to knows bout 
How we spend car money to glist our rolls out
Play bars and buy the cris and moes out
Flash benjies just to twist the hoes out
Fabolous the one from the menatti mix
Known to have more kicks than karate flicks
Slim nigga in a big body six
Wit enough dough and pull to Gotti fixed
If I wasn't rappin I'd have a ??? 
Down south in a town you never heard before
Dealin wit weight Columbians would murder for
??? cats I keep burnin for furthermore 
I'm the nigga every freak press be in a sleek S 
That's gon need week rest after greekfest 
Jump in private jets just to sneak west
Bet these calico shots rip through ya weak flesh

(chorus)
Niggas want it 
Now they get it 
Bitches on it 
Now they wit it
flooded up and custom fitted 
Tinted up and BB kinted 
Y'all gon wonder how we did it 
Y'all gon wonder how we get it
Y'all gon wonder how we did it 
Y'all gon wonder how we get it

Now sports the kind of nigga you could spot everyday
Sip lots of cherry 'Ze in a hot chevy 'Le
I know's a few niggas that plot to bury J 
Wanna scar my face put a shot in my derrier
What you gon do when we send shots from every way 
We got perion while y'all got perrier
I strut past in diamonds that could cut glass
Wit dime bitches that'll make a nigga nut fast
Now I gotta fiend bout to throw some chrome on a quarter
Cop a crown and put stones on a border
Smoke the trees now that's grown underwater
Still keep 9's that'll put ya bones out of order

Got the condo cats will leave ya dead for 
Chicks givin sarges and crucial head for 
That make local cops go to feds for
Anything you want nigga now I got the bread for

(chorus)

New York is getting money
Va is getting money 
LA is getting money 
Fabolous is getting money

(Fabolous)
Fabolous so cool I could play Texas
In Avirex's light gray lexus
Rockin white diamonds wit a gray necklace
Fuck and bounce don't even stay for breakfast
We doin shit that'll make maid neck twist
Wit a fancy chick we pay to pet kiss 
Fuck studs I'm bout to throw bagettes in my ear
And be getting head from brunettes in a lear 
If you ain't talkin money I don't wanna chit chat 
Throwin partys in Jamaica when I hit plat
Receivin chips thugs catch cases for 
Make bitches beat me til my waist is sore
Sport come through nigga like checks on the first
Doin the bump drivin a lex in reverse 
Now we don't pop it unless it's a hundred a wop
And I'ma keep hittin y'all like an abusive pops

(chorus)
