Pre-Verse: Lunch
I, I

(Verse 1)
[Lunch] Lunch is in the house
        You know what I'm about
        Get on the dance floor and turn the shit out (Ha ha)
        Baby gon' bounce (Yeah)
        Lookin' so fly
        You know how I get 'em, I can see it in your eyes
        Cali's on lock
        St. Louis gon' talk it out
        Dallas know me
        ATL, walk it out
        That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
        Flirtin' from the get-get
        Said she wanna kick it
        She love a nigga mixtape
        Mama is a hustler
        Mama is a grinder
        Put her in the club
[Ray J] Little mama is a winder
[Lunch] I'm right behind her
        You better not touch her
        Haters tryin' to catch up/ketchup, but can't cut the mustard

Refrain: Lunch
Strikin' with the venom
You fittin' in that denim
If you independent, girl, go ahead and get 'em
Get 'em

[Chorus]

[Singing Verse: Ray J]
Look at that girl
She's climbing up on the pole
She knows how to shake it (Yeah)
She's making me spend my dough
I wanna see her get naked
I'm in the spot where all the pretty girls at
When a player leave the club and bringing four back
When they get to the crib
Man, they know what it is
We gon' make this a moment for Kodak
Get 'em girl
The camera's rollin'
There's nobody
Just me holdin' it
Don't worry
I won't show it
I'm lying, tomorrow, I'm posting it
Ow!

[Chorus]

(Verse 2)
[Lunch] It's Lunch
        Now, everybody eat up
        Makin' pot holes
        I told these damn street's up
        Baby, put your feet up (Yeah)
        And let's take a ride
        You just get there, the rest I provide
        Y'all stay live
        Throw your hands high
        Get 'em all night, baby
[Ray J] My, my, my
[Lunch] Haters can't stand it
        Baby lookin' fancy (Nah)
        Two Latin broads that I met in Miami (Yeah)
        Friend named Candy
        She's tryin' to find me (Yeah)
        Know I'm in Cali, you never heard of the I.E.
        Get 'em in the Bay
        Get 'em in Salt Lake
        Get 'em in N.Y., make the homie heart shake
        Now

Repeat Pre-Verse &amp; Refrain
