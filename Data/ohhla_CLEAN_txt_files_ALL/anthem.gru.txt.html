Yo fuck the kiddy crap, I did that stupid shit already jack
Many rapper talk about how they come strapped with plenty gats
And how they, were sellin many cracks
I take my belt off and give 'em a hundred-twenty whacks
So many act, so I treat 'em like my sons
And nowadays you got frail niggaz frontin trife with guns
But I'm the chief like Beanie, none of y'all can see me
Cause my family ties go as deep as Genovese
Baldhead to the S-L-I-C-K
Wanna rhyme, take a ride down my freeway
Peace to all the PJ's and all the DJ's
My word are like multitude so keep my shit on replay
He say, she say, niggaz know I'm the man
Leavin emcees depressed, tryna find a new plan
And few can ever measure up to these standards
The name is Baldhead Slick and yo, this is "The Anthem"

[Chorus: *cuts*]
"It's the gifted, prolific one..."
"Subtractin others rappers... who lack..."
"It's the gifted, prolific one..."
"Known as... Baldhead Slick..."
"It's the gifted, prolific one..."
"Carryin my thoughts... the illest soldier..."
"It's the gifted, prolific one..."
"Known as... Baldhead Slick..."

One of the first real niggaz, to ever rock a baldie
Slick Daddy; that's what my ladies like to call me
Trained in combat, still smooth in approach
Live from first class, while you snooze in coach
Coppin cruiser boats, so I can rule the coast
Any altercation, our peeps and do a toast
I go from rockin Timberlands, to wearin Gucci boots
Never chasin a silly bitch, even if the groupie's cute
I'm stakin my claim, breakin you lames
I'll choke you out into submission, you ain't takin a bang
Fuck it, I'm takin the blame for straight shakin you up
Wakin you up, that doo-rag ain't makin you tough
Honestly you suck, like an infant on titties
Like kamikaze fighter planes, I bomb your city
Call me gritty, plus I'm spittin at random
Bitch I'm Baldhead Slick, and yeah this is "The Anthem"

[Chorus: *cuts*]
"It's the gifted, prolific one..."
"Subtractin others rappers... who lack..."
"It's the gifted, prolific one..."
"Known as... Baldhead Slick..."

[Guru]
Bis-Mi-Allah A-Rahman A-Rahim
All praises due, if ya know what I mean
I know what I've seen, so many folks broke with no CREAM
Bust out my own joints, so stop sellin me dreams
Stop tellin my lies, doing the work of Yaku
I'm diligent and militant and I'm gonna stop you
Drop you - right where ya standin
Son I'm Baldhead Slick and this is "The Anthem"

[Chorus: *cuts*]
"It's the gifted, prolific one..."
"Subtractin others rappers... who lack..."
"It's the gifted, prolific one..."
"Known as... Baldhead Slick..."
"It's the gifted, prolific one..."
"Carryin my thoughts... the illest soldier..."
"It's the gifted, prolific one..."
"Known as... Baldhead Slick..."</pre>
