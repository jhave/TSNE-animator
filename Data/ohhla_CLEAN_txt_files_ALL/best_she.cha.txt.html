[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
I be hustlin everyday, you know I love the money
Say they do it real big, they ain't done it like I done it
Put you on an airplane, send you where ever you want it
Yeah I told you never but tonight I'll spend some cheddar on it
When I hit ya town, just make sure you hit me up
The other night she told me that she couldn't get enough
And when she get bored and need a little love
She gonna say the same thing when I come around
She say Koopa you the best (yes)
Koopa you the best (yes)
Koopa you the best (yes)
Koopa you the best
I'm the best she ever had (man)
Best she ever had (man)
Best she ever had
Best she ever had
Baby, Koopa you the

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Show me to your residence and I can be your roommate (yeah)
We can see how comfortable the pillows in your room ain't (yep)
You ain't gonna sleep, ain't no time for countin sheep
Sweat is runnin down your back, the running back is runnin deep (hut)
Michael Vick ya 'cause I swear I'm 'bout to kill it dog
Only spit a couple bars and she can feel it in her drawers
When the album drop they'll say Chamillionaire's official
I'm lyin, there's not a album 'cause these verses like a scripture
But back to the topic, told you I'd never unlock it
Your body lookin so chocolate that tonight 
I'll probably drop it
Hop into my cockpit, put you on some of my chicks
If you like chicks like I like chicks, then maybe y'all can swap spit
Normally she sip a little wine before she go to sleep
She say it help her relax but nothin help her more than me (Woo)
Your chick is showin, she Naughty by Nature, +O.P.P.+
You might call it Treachery, I guess I'm just a ODB
Uh, that's when I knew that it was time to jet
Soon as she just st-stuttered and start starin at my shiny neck
Told her that tonight your blessed 'cause later you'll have time to stretch
I put ya on the floor and stretch ya out like a P90X
Yes (yes), I write the script and she just play along
Told ya it was on, the best evening she was ever shown
Wake up in the morn' and say she "So Far Gone"
And I didn't make it to the fourth, I only played Trey Songz

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
Freestyle, come on
This is a singin freestyle, she reppin H-Town
Got her own money and she got her own house
And I mean that
I can't stop starin at your cleavage
I'm just playin

They say in money that we trust and you would think that I'm crazy
If I let another man get in the bed with my baby
Ben Franklin that's the homie, so I say it's all gravy
That's the only person in the mattress under my lady
And she don't need no toys, there's no need for vibratin
When I lay her on the matt', get back, the doc is operatin
Some live to knock my hustle but they'll probably die hatin
Hustle like it's three of me, give a ménage a muah, baby</pre>
