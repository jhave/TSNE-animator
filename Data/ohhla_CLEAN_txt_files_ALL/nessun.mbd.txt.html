Havoc"
One two, one two Q.B.C. to London
A little something bumpin'
Mobb Deep the infamous national commissioners
While you're sleepin' to get it right got me creepin'
Awaking while you're beepin'
Off the hood she ain't a crook
Got shook never play it by the book
We off the hook while you try to figure out the name
I got three answers while you got the wrong questions
Affections, spread love in your section headin' torward your direction
Injection got you up in the Best Western
Room 109 is fine
And you're always on my mind you a dime 
Prepared, bring it over here don't be scared
Like caller 97 you're on the air
And I like the way 
And I like the way
And I like the way you bless my whole clique
And I like the way you bless my whole clique
And I like the way you bless my whole clique
And you look all good
In that satin sheets inbetween
