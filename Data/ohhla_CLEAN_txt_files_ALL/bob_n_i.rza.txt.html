[Intro: sample]
Birth flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze drifting by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for...
Birth flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze drifting by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me

[RZA]
Who be the last man standin' when I cock back the cannon? (Bobby!)
And blast your ass in search for Michael Landon (and)
Abandon ship, you can't penetrate (and)
My solar eclipse, you dickhead y'all get pussy-whipped (and)
Sword of Conan, wind speed of Rodin (and)
Flow so cold, I freeze M.C.'s to snowmen (and)
Turn 'em up to the sun to defrost them (and)
Proceed with caution, you get your bean baked in Boston (and)
Slice of lemonhead, it's like John Lennon said (and)
Help, you need somebody and (and)
If you ever see somebody and (and)
Fuckin' with the Wu, you gonna be a body and (and)
By me, myself and Bobby and (sha na na) (and)
You superficial nigga, fuck it I'm a superhero (and)
My pistol will turn you to a super zero (and)
Make a fingetip griplock of Royce Gracie (and)
While I'm makin' this cash like Mr. Spaceley (and)
Or Coswell Cogs, I don't fuck with hogs (and)
Your dialogue is stuck, too analog (and)
Is you guns heavy enough? (and)
Is your gold chain truck Chevy enough? (and)
To fuck around with Starks, Rebel and us (and)
B-O-B-B-Y (sha na na) (and)
You superficial nigga, buck it I'm a superhero (and)
My super pistol will turn you to a super zero (and)
Lot of niggaz askin' us, some faxin' us (and)
How I gladiate, take land like Maximus (and)
You listerin', while this winds blisterin' (and)
I'm in the clouds like my man Calrissian (and)
Lando, bust shots like Marlon Brando (and)
You gettin' smacked like I'm playin' black Sambo (and)
Hambone, hambone, haven't you heard? (and)
Papa gonna buy you a mockingbird (and)
If that mockingbird don't sing (and)
Papa gonna buy you a diamond ring (and)
Watch out for the Killa Bee sting (and)
BZA-Bobby (sha na na)

[Outro: RZA]
