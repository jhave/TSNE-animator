Sen Dog: Pa la salud!
B-Real: Pa la salud!... primero yo
Sen Dog: Primero usted...
B-Real: *grrrrrah!* 
B-Real and Sen Dog: *mexican yells*
B-Real: Hora hora, quien está...
Sen Dog: Cómetelo!

(Verse 1: Sen Dog)

Down for my barrio, enter my villa!
Tha hill called thrill, drinkin' over your area!
Makin' my queso down en México
Where the sun burns hot and then goes and downslow
Got my clan tell so everythin' is well
Got a villa in a mile, with the big spanish spell
And let it be know, that I'm down for tha tranza!
The brown rapin'hood, lookin' out for tha raza
See me in my ranfla on street bala poof
A can with stanboor, con crane no the loop
Try to pull us up but I got my soldados
Tha soul asesinos vienen preparados
Tha rappers desperados, with the fool on the claro
You know when we say 'get the money en tha mano!
Get the cash me in the desk call up my hermano
We all can jump down in the red-gusano...!

Chorus: 
Tequila sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money *edited*! 

(Verse 2: B-Real) 

I never knew money like this, in the palm of my hand 
'Til I met the man with mad hook-up, and big plan 
Every where you look'a, he got everybody shook up 
Running for cover, the big bad WOOF, for tha cock out
He was like a father figure, show me the bigger picture 
That was slangin' on the corner, don't let the pigs get you 
Not like these fools who don't comprehend 
You end up doing a twenty-five bid in the pen 
You got that? Getting your cup, I took a swig
The bitter taste of the 'mezcal', free worm shhh...
Droppin' a lesson, he slapped my face, he said listen 
Pay attention brotha, you're my ace, but don't ever question 
Just do what I say, and you'll be rich 
And keep this in your mind: rats lay in a ditch with no spine 
Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game 
Cheers, they all know your name, it's like fame 
Why women and money don't mix? like drinking and driving 
Watch those conniving women and keep your eye out 
Always be aware of what's around you 
They wanna down you, and see daekin' clown you 
Keep your shhh in order the money won't stop 
Pretty soon you'll be on top

(Chorus) 

(Verse 3: B-Real) 

Tequila Sunrise, with the bloodshot eyes 
My, my, my, how time flies and goes by surprise 
My mentor passed on and passed a warn to me, emergency 
For my enemies who wanna murder me 
Eat the worm, bethler brother, while you burn, you'll be stoped
Better kill me, don't let me return, *edited*
Trust no man, cause I'll be back, you understand? 
With a plan, and my ace in hand, I want it all 
I recall the words from Jesus, you are the Juice 
Better go get it, don't let it get to your head, embed it 
Let these words stick, you better be ready to die 
Now take a big sip, caution it, but I never lie...

(Chorus) 

B-Smooth: Tequila...
Sen Dog: Eat tha worm ese... eat tha *edited*
Allways quieren ese... es como Coahuila homie...
