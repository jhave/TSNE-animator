[Intro - Young Buck]

All my thugs and thugettes
Walk where I walk, see what I see
Now I welcome you to Cashville, Tennekee
All my life, I hustled all night
Now I'm alright, my wrist is all ice
And I did it all, without y'all advice
I done been to hell and back, twice
You can do it like me
 
[Verse - Young Buck]
Now as the world turns, I let my bud burn
Police writin' down my tags, like I'm concerned
I graduated from the nickels and dimes
You need the fed's bitch to come get mine
Get on the grind hoe and stay the fuck outta mine fo'
The kids find daddy laid out with his eyes closed
I know, can't be humble in the jungle
Gave a nigga an inch, he'll take a whole mile from ya
What's worse? Wakin' up in the pen, or sleepin' under the dirt
Boo yow is the sound of the 40 cal
AK's, banana clips hold a 100 rounds
Test me, rude boy don't want none
Got Jamaicans and Haitians buck, buck, buckin' they gun
Where the hood at? nigga, that's where I come from
Where shoot dice, snort white, sell crack and heroin
 
[Chorus - Young Buck (50 Cent)]
You can walk like I do, and talk like me too
But nobody gon' rock with you
Cuz you can't do it like me, nah you can't do it like me
(Hold on a second homie, let's get this clear)
You can walk like I do, and talk like me too
But nobody gon' rock with you
Cuz you can't do it like me, cuz you can't do it like me
(Hold on a second homie, let's get this clear)
G-Unit!
 
[Verse - Young Buck]
Somebody tell me what this world comin' to
Why they go get they metal detectors when we come through
Ya I know we got beef, and niggas say they wanna kill us
But you can't get mad, cuz the whole word feel us
Do the math, half of these niggas lyin' in they rhymes
They don't even read the paper work, just sign on the line
I got a 9, and a heart to go get mine
And I'll be God damn, if I take a loss this time
I'm fishline, in the water, nibble only to get caught
May I take ya order? Ya, I can get it in New York
See the streets know, this nigga here'll let the heat go
Be low, don't be no muthafuckin' hero
A kilo'll get a nigga whole click killed
You ain't gotta spend shit, niggas'll hustle up a mil'
When you live with all the roaches, you kill all the rats
And the thugs that ain't focused, get they head cracked
 
[Chorus - Young Buck (50 Cent)]
You can walk like I do, and talk like me too
But nobody gon' rock with you
Cuz you can't do it like me, nah you can't do it like me
(Hold on a second homie, let's get this clear)
You can walk like I do, and talk like me too
But nobody gon' rock with you
Cuz you can't do it like me, cuz you can't do it like me
(Hold on a second homie, let's get this clear)
G-Unit!
 
[Verse - Young Buck]
I know I got a dirty mouth, bitch I'm from the South
I'm nothin' like what you done seen or you done heard about
I'm in my best on the block, a vest and a glock, and the rest in my sock
Unless I was Pac, you won't see me with a cross on my back
Gotta do my own thang, can't copy that cat
Let me holla at ya for a minute man
If ya stand for nothin' nigga, you'll fall for anything
I'm bustin' any brain, they say that I'm insane
But I came in this game with cocaine in my veins
What I'm sayin', that I'm trained to go and turn a penny to a 20
You complain, I'd rather work with what he sent me, ain't it strange
How I went from a hooptie to a Benz, I ain't changed
I'm in the hood, you want me? come and get me
Feel my pain, but don't feel sorry for me
Cuz there some kids in Somalia with nothin' to eat
 
[Chorus - Young Buck (50 Cent)]
You can walk like I do, and talk like me too
But nobody gon' rock with you
Cuz you can't do it like me, nah you can't do it like me
(Hold on a second homie, let's get this clear)
You can walk like I do, and talk like me too
But nobody gon' rock with you
Cuz you can't do it like me, cuz you can't do it like me
(Hold on a second homie, let's get this clear)
G-Unit!
