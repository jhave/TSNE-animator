Oh shit, I took a X pill now I'm ready to fl-ip
I smoke the fat joint, now I'm shit outta luck
There goes another chicken head ready to cluck
Damn yo, ya gotcha clothes off
I ain't even poured the liquor yet you must be a vet
Damn you soft, yeah you already wet
Let me get some glasses, then we start to heavy pet
Think 777 93 11, how you fit up all that lovin' in your oven
A nigga hit that shit and not owe you nuttin'?
Ain't that suttin'?

Now I'm heading to the store, to get some orange juice
Cos' I'm coming down
It's time to get loose, heading for a club
I think it's after two, Imma rolls this dubs
We gonna smoke its true, step into the place
It's time to party again, what's that nigga doing in the club with the cardigan
My nigga Wildchild roll through with the Scotch and Gin
The thickest ones over there, they know that we're watchin' them
Shake shake, shake shake
Ooohh

Astro-black, get the one with all backs
The one that likes gettin' their hair pulled and ass smacked
Yeah all day yo I be up in the sack, sippin' on Courvoisier while she's
rubbin' my back

Nigga's like, "Where's Quas at, I ain't seen the nigga in a week"

Most likely a nigga like me's chillin' wid a house freak
Astro-black latex, in line who's next? Wait

Wow that's from the last album, ain't you over that yet?

Fuck you</pre>
