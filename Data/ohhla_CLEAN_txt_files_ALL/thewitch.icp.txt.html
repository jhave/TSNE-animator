[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]
The Witch jumped on my back last night
I couldn't breathe in it's clutch, I was frozen with fright
It went on for what seemed like hours of terror
To see the Witch's face stare in the dark at the mirror

[Violent J]
The Witch told me my girlfriend was a demon
And all this fallin' in love shit, I'm dreamin'
And it's pain to the angels if I don't deliver
I sealed her off in a barrel and rolled her in the river

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
The Witch told me my left arm is possessed
So I broke it at first and then I went and confessed
But they put me in a home, the arm still wouldn't leave me alone
Finally had to chew it off at the bone

[Violent J]
The Witch told me to crawl under my house and just wait
Don't panic if I suffocate
I bit the tail off a possum down there at one point
It's so boring and it's dark but the Witch is my life

[Hook]
Something is standing in between me and my sanity
They say my Witch is a dream, morbid fantasy
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE 'EM!)
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE 'EM!)

[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]
The Witch taught me how to cut up a body
It's nasty and wretched and hella of bloody
But it's gotta get done and somebody's gotta do it
I kicked the fuckin' face in and put my knife through it

[Violent J]
The Witch jumped on me again, here we go
Layin' in my bed, I can't breathe anymo'
Layin' in my bed, I can't move anymo'
There's a demon floating in my face, clampin' my jaw

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
The Witch told me I gotta murder this one kid
'Kay well maybe the witch didn't then, but I did
With a ninja suit, crept through like a black widow
with a crossbow, stuck him in the neck like ditto

[Violent J]
The Witch told me about blood that rains
Out of the neck and what particular veins
And about murder, witnessin' death settin' in
And it ain't no Heaven that's lettin' me in

[Hook]
Something is standing in between me and my sanity
They say my Witch is a dream, morbid fantasy
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE 'EM!)
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE 'EM!)

[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]
The Witch told me to put my feet in the fire and hold on
Until everything below the knees gone
Now I'm in a wheelchair with only an arm but don't care
I can still throw my hatchet in the air

[Violent J]
The Witch got me in a predicament, it ain't good
I got somebody head posted on my hood
4:30 a.m. and we rollin' through the ghetto
Shaggy ridin' shotgun and the Witch is in the middle

[Hook]
Something is standing in between me and my sanity
They say my Witch is a dream, morbid fantasy
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE 'EM!)
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE 'EM!)

I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE 'EM!)
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE 'EM!)

I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE 'EM!)
I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
(WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE THE DEAD! WAKE 'EM!)</pre>
