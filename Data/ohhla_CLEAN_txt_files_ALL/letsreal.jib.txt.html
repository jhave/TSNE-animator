[J. Valentine] + (Jibbs) + {other}
Let's be real~!
(See, it could be just me and you) {Polow Da Don}
(He really wasn't made for you.. you gotta understand)

[Intro: J. Valentine] + (Jibbs) + {other}
Deep inside you know the truth {DOES HE LOVE YOU LIKE I DO}
He don't really love you {DOES HE LOVE YOU LIKE I DO}
Ba-byyyy you've gotta face the truth (face the truth girl)
You know I'ma keep it real wit'chu {DOES HE LOVE YOU LIKE I DO}
Let's be real

[Jibbs] + {other}
It was December in the Chi' when I saw you walkin by
With the tears in your eyes and I walked up to your side
So I asked you how you feel, "Girl is everything alright?"
I want you to keep it real, girl you ain't gotta lie
See that dude is a mark a predator and a shark
And I knew that from the start he wanted to break your heart
You ain't got to think twice cause I ain't that type of guy
I'd rather see you happy, I don't want to see you cry
Let's, be, f'real - c'mon now
Let's, be, f'real {DOES HE LOVE YOU LIKE I DO} he got no love
like I have for you, really feelin bad for you
Out of all of this time he never had love I have for you

[Chorus: J. Valentine] + (Jibbs)
Deep inside you know the truth (you know the truth girl)
He don't really love you (he never loved you)
Ba-byyyy you've gotta face the truth (face the truth girl)
You know I'ma keep it real wit'chu
Let's be real

[Jibbs]
Hold up - f'real he disrespect ya (uh-huh) he don't protect ya
I know it hurts but you gotta keep your head up
He doesn't love y, but I can treat you better
That's why I think, me and you should be together
He doesn't need ya (uh-uh) bet I can please ya (uh-huh)
He doesn't trust ya forever tryin to treat you
He tryin to test ya, look at your texture
You should tell him tell him that he really got you messed up
Tell him to beat it, me in your life you need it
I'm willin to do whatever, you really can't beat it
I'm your keeper, my words you need to keep it
Fresh air, I can be the reason why you breathin

[Chorus] with minor ad libs

[Jibbs]
F'real - he disrespect ya, he don't protect ya
When you in need he don't, hurry to catch ya
Hurt and neglect ya, certain to stress ya
I ain't your daddy girl, you can do whatever
Let's, be, f'real - c'mon now
Let's, be, f'real - you know whassup
Let's, be, f'real - c'mon now
Let's, be, f'real - na na, na na

[J. Valentine - repeat 2X]
It's best you let him go, or you will never know
What we could be why can't you see, he ain't the one for you

[Chorus] with minor ad libs

[Outro: Jibbs] + {other}
See, me, I'ma tell you the truth
{DOES HE LOVE YOU LIKE I DO}
He been tellin you lies
I don't think he really right for you
Not tryin to hate on him
But see me, I see the bigger picture
{DOES HE LOVE YOU LIKE I DO}
We'd be perfect together
Just give me a chance {DOES HE LOVE YOU LIKE I DO, NO~!}
Let him go, and I'ma let you know
Yeah! Follow me
I'ma take you down the right path... {*fades out*}</pre>
