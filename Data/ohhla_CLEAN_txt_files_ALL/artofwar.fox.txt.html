Each day strolled Wit the eve same day
Strut I charters'm all It's the Art of War
What you think I fucks wit S dot Carter for
WOW!
Word to BIG I've been on the coast of France
In Flip-flops doing Egyptian dance
DOUTY!
Its like I'm ROXANNE reenacted
I'm back on my deem, the game is remastered!
Babebro I'm a NINE year veteran, y'all got a
Problem I'm picking up the pen again, bredrin 
Till the casket drops, I'm in Flatbush LOW
In a glass top! YEH!

Murdering them blood clot!

Yeah I'm fronting but y'all motherfuckers love it though
Bredring let me work it to you slow
Throwbacks to throw back I'm mean niggaz really though
Get you a Ryan King button up bucket low
Jay got y'all niggaz dressing up for real, got every young
Hood nigga looking like for real
Ain't no telling what the Fox will do?
I'm in the Phantom stunting something like a Rasta do
FUCK Gulliani! I'm right here in Chiprianni
With the shottyboy aiming at y'all battyboys
Mommy's home and I got the FOURTY AUTOMATIC CHROME
For all the chatty chatty y'all been doing!

[Chorus: Foxy Brown &amp; Jimmy Hendrix] - repeat 2X

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
Aiyyo! NINE straight years critics might not
Admit it but no bitch in rap did it quite like FOX
Did it, and it's before I wore it, I did it so Lovely
I got tiered of it I don't ware it no more
And that goes from everything from the
Christian Dior to Christon Luibiton
They got a problem Shawn
Fours years gone I'm stil holding the belt
Ain't got to tell you I'm the best
Homie ain't nothing else
Holla!

[Chorus: Foxy Brown &amp; Jimmy Hendrix] - repeat 4X
