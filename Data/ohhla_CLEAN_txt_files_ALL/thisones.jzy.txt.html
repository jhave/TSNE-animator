[Chorus: Jeezy]
I'm blowin good yea I smoke it by tha zone
And when them niggas call I don't pick up my phone
Niggas actin like broads make me pick up my tone
I had a lil time so I wrote a lil song
Yea this ones for you fuck niggas fuck niggas
Yea I'm talkinn bout them fuck niggas fuck niggas
Yea this ones for you fuck niggas fuck niggas
Yea I'm talkinn bout them fuck niggas fuck niggas
This ones for you

[Young Jeezy]
I'm high southwest jizzle when your flight land
I don't know bitch I might fly to england
Hit tha highway with tha change yea tha change man
I done it my way with them thangs change tha game plan
Had these niggas tellin lies they just sound true
Nigga if you had it like that nigga I would of found you
I'm tryin to cash out a hunned lemme get a buck
Must of been just like you nigga fake as fuck
Getem home and they probably all sheet rock
They sellin bullshit fuckinn up tha street stock
You livinn mine and yours that's a double dip
That synthetic ass shit we call it double whip
And nigga nuthinn beat tha cross but tha double cross
I ran tha streets and rap bitch ima double boss
Tha nigga cashed out once I sent tha double off
They knocked em off half way I took a double loss

[Chorus: Jeezy]

[Trick Daddy]
Lets put these niggas on tha stand
Now stand up and be a man
Raise your hand and swear you were ma number one fan
And I'm still that same nigga you still that same nigga
But at tha same time I'm startinn to get bad vibes
What I owe you sumthinn nigga thats what you act like
Ain't like them other niggas boy you better act right
Tha first two years of your deal ride ya traininn wheels
And then you graduated and lived how real niggas lived
And I ain't dissin naw I ain't dissin
But when you sit back an listen
This what tha rap game is missin
I'm used to thug niggas
Its to many young niggas with
Too much liquor too many drugs in em
Too many cliqs too much swag now
Too many niggas swearinn tight shirts and skinnys
Walked around with they ass out
Yall better cash out
Gone put yo cash up
Cause I'm all in if I don't win
Nigga I'ma mask up

[Chorus: Jeezy]

[Young Jeezy]
Hardest part of life niggas cant play they role
Errbody wanna ride tha train but don't wanna pay tha toll
Keep it going young boy you on a roll
Hoe nigga magazine you tha center fold
U can check tha resume nigga I'm good as gold
Lawn chair ass niggas all they do is fold
Nigga you talkin with emotion you emotional
U might can get a lil light feelin promotional
Tell me what you see when you lookin ina mirror
Look at this hoeass nigga I couldn't said it clearer
And you tha same nigga started up this jewelry game
And when you see him nowaday that nigga jewelry lame
Ain't got it by now nigga you ain't got it
And nigga why you talkin like that cause bitch you ain't bout it
And nigga how you doin now worst than before
And bitch we winning over here I'm be keeping score

[Chorus: Jeezy]</pre>
