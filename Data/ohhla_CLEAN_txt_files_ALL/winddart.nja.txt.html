[Lone Ninja]
Brawl, assail the knives are terrible
you all should hail the five star general 	
Strike hard never lose building the coffins
My darts sever you killing the guardsman			
Ill with jargon hunt for the prey
Bring chills to your squadron puncture with blade			
Suffer in pain I struck and you aching
Fuck is you saying it's ruckus and mayhem			
Smash plans the sole survivor of the
Last stand bash slam my foes cadavers if they can't scram	
Damn, I devastate, you're scorned
Bam, I'm detonating bombs			
Eliminate competition they must submit
Obliterate opposition they're crushed to bits			
Duck or dip I squash you fake posers
Shut your lips it's hostile takeover			
Vets struck and in shock saw their doom
Use death touch of dim mak mortal wound				
Mournful gloom I seige and I come with agression
Portals loom that leads to another dimension		
Great hysteria you knew that it wasn't good
Raid the area I move with the gloves and hood		
Roar and groan throw a fit and fume
In a  war zone with a pissed platoon			
The ninja will slaughter the prince and the pauper
I injure enforcers hinder and torture			
Clinch with the brawler I'm ready to wrestle
Flinch your a goner I'm deadly and dreadful			
Eerie and vengeful raid and lurk
It very essential you stay alert				
The scrolls ancient it's timeless and hidden
The rogue agent's assigned to the mission	

		
[Lone Ninja]
No trespass opposing foes get bashed
Neck slashed behold the cold death mask 	
Lone slice you through if you cross the cobra
The stove pipe bazooka's across the shoulder	
The boss assaulter deadly with hammer and axe
I cause a halt to enemies plan of attack		
You're slammed on your back I storm with marauders invading
Ram your barracks I'm bombing your fortification	
my father's jamaican a yo what the bombaclat
The horror awakens opponents are flung and dropped  
I swung and chopped you'll lose a limb
A hooligan intruders I do em in			
The bruiser wins I'm too tough you cry in fear
Cruel and grim so suit up in riot gear		
The iron spear will pierce your breastplate
No lives is spared if you dared to vexate		
Flee and evacuate I'm paid a fee to assassinate
As they can see all traitors bleed as I lascerate		
smash and break I draw the cutlass
Attack with grace and brawl with toughness			
My aura's lustrous the soldier's in battle
I rose from the shambles I roam in the shadows				
Harsh with artillery sniper's in marsh
clobber arch enemy strike with wind darts	</pre>
