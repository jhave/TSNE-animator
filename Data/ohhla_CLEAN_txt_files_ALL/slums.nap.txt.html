We represent the slums.. alright..
Let's get this motherfucker crunkin from Kentucky to Baghdad
Ya pops was always gone but that didn't make him a bad dad
We still managed to eat, and come to think wattn't half bad
But Doug was always on us bout the things that we never had
Now I was born in Oakland better known as the Cold Town
Done seen too many folk down, some put the soul down
Done heard my momma cryin if I knew what I know now
I'd pro'ly have to greet the party room with the fo' pound
I'm tryna keep my head on straight to keep me from catchin
in case I feel my insides burnin, musta swallowed all twenty-eight
I'm drinkin Milk of Magnesia, but still I ain't feelin straight
Some mo' had murdered my granddad over real-estate

[Hook: R. Prophit w/ sample playing in background]
Represent the slums... represent the slums...
Represent the slums... aww, aww, aww, aww...
Represent the slums... represent the slums...
Represent the slums... aww, aww, aww, aww...

[Big V]
Bummy, if I put it out - sucky, if I pull it out
Ohh me, ya better kick it out, or ya livin in a haunted house
Ran what you tried to run, came how you tried to come
Did what you couldn't do, difference between me and you
Slum for a while now, country for a lifetime
Cool is what I choose to be, but that ain't what I used to be
Muddy waters couldn't drown a nigga, bloodhounds on the trail for real
Shakin up this rap shit, givin niggaz hell for real
Turn a hold the dog deal, mucus and you hearin right
National Geographic ain't, fuckin with this wildlife
Hissin; I'm finna strike, rattlin; I'm finna bite
Hell with a blue light, fuckin with no rules tonight!

[Hook] - 2X

[Scales]
Now once again, you see me layin down the law
These cowards tryna catch me like my hustle got a flaw
Bitch I'm Southern bred
That's where you break it down to raw and then you flush the rest
I said you break it down to raw and then you flush the rest
And I ain't playin witcha'll haters since y'all fucked up my order
Got me playin with a gram, coulda been up to a quarter
Now my cousin, called me up and said he finally did it
Graduated from a handheld, to primary digits
Cuz in the slums we don't work we just grind and gamble
Guarunteed I got that shit, niggaz dyin to sample
Now whattchu know about that work from the states of Georgia
Cook so thick, collard, grits and water (we in the slums!)
