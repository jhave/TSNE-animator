The fuck is you doing Man fuck it I'm telling you nigga

[C-Bo]
Can't take my back is ill tack what I know sky is the limit
But this world is full of envy hold me back I've been done it
Shit what you thought C-Bo wasn't down
It's just hella hard to get up when the hoe get to the ground
Get cha realla can't take it so they gave me a case
I got skills but I can't make it being Enemy of the State
I close my eyes pray to GOD guess this will remember me
Just like 'Pac "Against the World" but it's the world against me
Scared to see me in much you wills flossin a whip
Tossing a your bitch you slip we hit now we tossing a clips
Bossing and shit next thing I'm bubling and cavi
cause if the cold world air maxs
All the dubs on my navi holla at me shit fans want to see me in action
Heard they mac what they make in a year I pay in taxes
I'ma ball like the Jackson's and I won't stop till my casket
Or I hurta them bastards

Sacramento rap artist C-Bo faces crimial charges in the state of Ohio
Local police cease two firearms and one pound of marajuana
Apprehended by four US marshalls by the state of Washington

[C-Bo]
They thought it was over but it just started
And some of the hardest artists in the world
Freedom of speach got me preaching to every G on the street
We got to eat so fuck the P.D. three striking me
Not liking me want to strike me like Rodney King
But I am a home run hitter so I swing batter batter swing
Got to scheme to get away and I'm gonna scream yes yes y'all
As I put the beam to his fuckin face and a new case is a hurt ya
As I point the seven inch flame in about the HK
Hit the gas and get further
And hit the white boy in the head wit a birck and started dancin
Fuck parole and Pete Wilson I'm so fresh out the pen hoe holdin heat
Like Billy the Kid quick to split a nigga's wig I'm the type of nigga pop you
out till you lend me a cape

Rap star C-Bo; since his debut on Tupac "All Eyez on Me"
Seemed to be drifting down the same road as Shakur was
With authorities C-Bo's albums sales heat up after rapper's parole arrest
Thomas was acquitted for 4 years in Soledad prison of the illegal use of firearm
He could be sent back to prison for a year if the board of prisons
Determine that the lyrics on the album promoted a gang related lifestyle

[C-Bo]
I'll bring it to them how they want it cause there is only one way to do it
Bring it to them how they knew it on they death bed put by fluid
Put a slug in his cranium catch'em close range
I'm flaming them I'm the West Coast don loc fresh out of prison and smoke
Better check my backround I crack crowns I never back down
You want some ruff shit tuff shit you get dust quick
See me in traffic grab your automatic and bust bitch you violated my freedom
Only playback is eat'em like Dahmer but I bomb'em with teflon when I'm on em
Fuck parloe fuck prison fuck those that don't want to listen

Hi I'm Jon Norris with MTV news this hour on music biz
racism and online hate speech - but first, albums have been stickered and banned
and in the past Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew was arrested
for a night because of an onstage performance;
but on Tuesday we believe for the first time a recording artist has been
jailed for the lyrics on his record
he is Sacramento based rapper C-Bo given the name Shawn Thomas
according to the California State Department of Corrections
The new C-bo album "Till My Casket Drops" has lyrics that do just that plus
this one your about to hear</pre>
