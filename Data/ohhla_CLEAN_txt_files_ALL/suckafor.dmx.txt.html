[Dani Stevenson - repeat 4X]
Doin me, like you do
Cause I know, that's what you do

[Intro: DMX]
Grrrrrrr... yo, I mean
You gon' fuck with the kid, fuck with the kid
I ain't got time to be, playin games and, real talk
Never been a sucka for love
So if it come down to you and me you know, I don't give a fuck
The next bitch like "What's up?"
Cause at the end of the day, you ain't never been nuttin but a nut

[Chorus: DMX]
I ain't never been a sucka for love
So if it come down to you and me, you know, I don't give a fuck
Hook the next bitch like "What's up?"
Cause at the end of the day, you ain't never been nuttin but a nut

[DMX]
Listen boo, you's a bitch, been a bitch
You know how niggaz do, run up in a bitch
Fuck her well, then a bitch'll call them bitches
Within a week or two I'm fuckin all them bitches
A nigga gotta fall back and take a breather
Shorty suck a mean dick, but in the morning I gotta leave her
Wasn't tryin to deceive her, I just wanted my dick sucked
She cute as a muh'fucker, and she got a BIG BUTT!
Now I'm like, what do I do from here?
Cause she actin like she ain't tryin to go nowhere
I ain't really tryin to get attached to this bitch
It's Friday, I just want some ass in this bitch
Can't be mad at me, I'm just doin what niggaz do
Got kids by HIM, and you wanna be a nigga's BOO?
What, REALLY? Oh you think it's like THAT?
OKAY~! I'll be right back

[Chorus] - 2X w/ Dani ad libs

[DMX]
It was summertime, I was in the slumps
Seen that chick from before, I was like "What's up?"
Remember me? I was that kid
It was you her and me, we just did what we did
How you expect me to respect you
when I know at least five other niggaz that you gave sex to?
I ain't never been a sucker
So if you THINK SO, you got the wrong motherfucker
Grrrrrr, what's my name?
Ah, ah, BITCH! What's my name?
You know what the fuck it is
I'm a real nigga that's gon' handle his!

[Chorus] - 2X w/ Dani ad libs

[DMX] + (Dani Stevenson)
I like the way the beat hits
Oooh, this that street shhhh
Shorty can you keep a secret? (Yes)
You the one I'm tryna creep with (ooooh)
Grrrr, c'mon, car's outside
Hotel up the block, jump in the ride
You and me for the, rest of the night
It's all good, click (turn off the lights)
Uh, back it up like that, girl
Ooooh, that ass is fat, girl (you like that?)
We almost there baby! (ooooh)
AHH SHIT! YEAH BABY!!

[Chorus] - 4X w/ Dani ad libs</pre>
