[Intro]
Raps I bust 'em
Problems with my life, don't discuss 'em
Coupes and Leer Jets, I lust 'em
Raps I bust 'em
Problems with my life, don't discuss 'em
Coupes and Leer Jets and Leer Jets
Raps I bust 'em
Problems with my life, don't discuss 'em
Coupes and Leer Jets, I lust 'em
Raps I bust 'em
Problems with my life, don't discuss 'em
Coupes and Leer Jets and Leer Jets

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
I whip a Z06 fat on the Crescent City connection
Tee tops off the roof, safety of the weapon
Politics for politicians legislative reppin'
Discussing buying property to make 'em feel my presence
All over this bitch, the small world that it is
Niggas is slipping and Spitta steady gaining position
Buddy about his business, '08 in the brakes
Lamborghini season we personalize the plates
Looking down on the States from gulf streams away
30, 000 feet like my last classic tape
Cranberry splashes with bub in the glasses
That's my Mimosa so we call it a fly Sosa
Bitches long lashes, big titties and fat asses
Bottoms up the same way I cut 'em when I smash 'em
Play the cut with a orange streak striped jacket, uhh
Mets fitted, my Pat Ewing's is vintage
Buddy I'm a mad man so fly the image
Holy Grail, many men failed tryna get it
Hot Spitta is present, success is destined
Read the same script as Will Smith, I Am Legend
Ain't no messing with the set that I'm repping
Jets fly high, drop fire where you steppin'
Play the lowrider for the days of my West End
That Impala dancing like Soulja Boy Tell 'Em

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Raps I bust 'em
Problems with my life, don't discuss 'em
Coupes and Leer Jets, I lust 'em
Raps I bust 'em
Problems with my life, don't discuss 'em
Coupes and Leer Jets and Leer Jets
Raps I bust 'em
Problems with my life, don't discuss 'em
Coupes and Leer Jets, I lust 'em
Raps I bust 'em
Problems with my life, don't discuss 'em
Coupes and Leer Jets and Leer Jets

[Verse 2: Fiend]
I'm cooler than most
Socialize with folks
Cause and bloods
LK's, GD's, VL's and Thugs
Some pompous some addicted to drugs
Is you buying or selling?
Is you lying or telling?
Felons, remember Scott told me to lean back
Before I heard red marlboro snitching a G pass
Obviously with Jones right there where the fiends at
Man Spitta told me this year he doing Lamborghini's
I just wanna pull a Sam and buck fifty, believe me
I see the cash in my sleep like a baby do angels
Wake up, it's not there and it's painful
Harsh reality, dark, high gotta make that salary
It's like the Vick soul be after me
20 thousand for the chain to get you mad at me
I plow a hole in ya girl, now she nagging me
Ya man ain't bad as me
It might seem like I'm rambling
But really I'm scrambling
Like Drew Brees
On some new endeavors to get some new cheese, new sleeves
And some thousand dollar britches
New shoes can't forget the collar, holler at the bitches

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Raps I bust 'em
Problems with my life, don't discuss 'em
Coupes and Leer Jets, I lust 'em
Raps I bust 'em
Problems with my life, don't discuss 'em
Coupes and Leer Jets and Leer Jets
Raps I bust 'em
Problems with my life, don't discuss 'em
Coupes and Leer Jets, I lust 'em
Raps I bust 'em
Problems with my life, don't discuss 'em
Coupes and Leer Jets and Leer Jets</pre>
