It's Detroit Stand Up!

I'm in the truck sitting high like proper etiquette
Iller than I ever been
Blowing on that medicine
Used to have dreams of copping cribs on Edison

Now I'm doing shit thought I never could afford
Art on the wall like science project boards
Parquet floor
Green like Celtic
Furniture you touch be like what's this velvet?
Used to play the block with the sack by the pelvis
Fiends O.D.ing on they toilet like Elvis (eww)

So now I kill beats
So much coroners pick up notepad sheets
Bullhead skinnies Hilfiger fleece
Sort of like a futuristic 1993
A lot my niggas dead
A lot my niggas locked
A lot my niggas left and moved on from the block
Some of my niggas here
And some got guap
And some may gotta piss in a motherfucking pot
We used to play the block
We never get old
The fridge ain't got shit but the bread with the mold
And some ain't got shoes just the ones with the holes
The one you call talkers with the fucking plastic soles
So now we change the system
To shit we can't afford and
Check from Mickey D's can't buy a pair of Jordans
And hotboys gotta get it how they live

[Chorus]
Close your eyes I'm bout to take you to a city, it ain't pretty, it ain't nowhere to go
Run and hide when you on the other side it ain't easy it ain't nowhere to go
Land of misery a place full of history but seriously it's nowhere to go

I seen my nigga Luck before he went up for life
He said Brown you nice and nigga send your sacrifice
Chill on the streets it ain't here for ya
Cause when you get locked don't nobody care for ya
Did a little time ain't make a phone call
Book stay thick like a church going broad
Locked in the county ain't never seen a thorough
Now I hit the thrift stores cop a vicious polo
Never talk loud to get my point across
The only alligator that I rock is LaCoste
Detroit player word to my nigga B.I.G
Play this type of shit while you rockin up for B.I.G
Cause I blow 2 blunts before I brush my teeth
Ain't seen what they looking like but I'm smoking good
Eating Better
So I stay full
J stay paid
Brown do too

[Chorus]</pre>
