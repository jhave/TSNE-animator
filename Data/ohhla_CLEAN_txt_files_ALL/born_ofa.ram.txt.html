[Zack de la Rocha - *whispering*]
My fears hunt me down..
Capturing my memories..
The frontier of loss..
They try to escape across the street where..
Jesus stripped bare..
And raped the spirit He was supposed to nurture..
In the name of my..
In the name of my..

[Hook]
BORN OF A BROKEN MAN, BUT NOT A BROKEN MAN!!
BORN OF A BROKEN MAN, NEVER A BROKEN MAN!!
BORN OF A BROKEN MAN, BUT NOT A BROKEN MAN!!
BORN OF A BROKEN MAN, NEVER A BROKEN MAN!!

Like autumn leaves his sense fell from him..
An empty glass of himself....shattered somewhere within..
His thoughts like a hundred moths...trapped in a lampshade...
Somewhere within...
Their wings banging and burning...on through endless night...
Forever awake he lies shaking and starving..
Praying for someone to turn off the light...

[Hook]
BORN OF A BROKEN MAN, NEVER A BROKEN MAN!!
BORN OF A BROKEN MAN, BUT NOT A BROKEN MAN!!
BORN OF A BROKEN MAN, NEVER A BROKEN MAN!!
BORN OF A BROKEN MAN, BUT NOT A BROKEN MAN!!

UGH!
UGH!!

My fear is hunting me down..
Capturing my memories..
The frontier of loss...
They try to escape across the street where..
Jesus stripped bare..
And raped the spirit He was supposed to nurture..
In the name of my..
In the name of my..

[guitar riff]

YEAAAH!!

[Hook]
BORN OF A BROKEN MAN, BUT NOT A BROKEN MAN!!
BORN OF A BROKEN MAN, NEVER A BROKEN MAN!!
BORN OF A BROKEN MAN, BUT NOT A BROKEN MAN!!
BORN OF A BROKEN MAN, NEVER A BROKEN MAN!!

UGH!
WHA?!
YEAH!!
UGH!!
YEAH!!
C'MON!!</pre>
