Boss Hogg, see you over there
Getting hustled on mayn, I see you on that corner
Getting that money, but you know what
You need to come fuck with your boy
I got some shit on my mind, uh

[Slim Thug]
I'll show you, how to get that do'
I'll show you how to show up, and get that hoe
I'll show you, how to get that Lac
I'll show you how to get a brick, out them packs
I'll show you, how to set up shop
I'll show you how to hit the block, and wet up drops
I'll show you, how to shake them cops
I'll show you how to stash them glocks, and cash in stocks
I'll show you, how to get your grind on
And get your shine on, without getting your mind blown
I'll show you, how to get six cars
I'll show you how to constantly, spit hit bars
I'll show you, how to live your dreams
I'll show you how to get yourself, a gangsta team
I'll show you, how to crawl like me
I'll show you how to get rich, and ball like me

[Hook]
We'll show you, how to grind and hustle
If you can't do it, show you how to find a hustle
We'll show you, how to mash and get it
Pulling all nighters, busting your ass to get it
We'll show you, how to get that do'
Get with your click, so you niggaz can split that do'
We'll show you, it ain't hard to do
So open your ears, and listen to these Boyz N Blue

[Kyleon]
I'll show you, how to cop that glock
I'll show you how to chop that rock, I'll show you how to shop that block

If it get hectic cock that pound, I'll show you how to cook that crack
Move that stract if you lose, how to get that back
No shorts no losses, gotta get that stack
I'll show you, the heart of a hustler
Not a nigga out here acting, trying to play the part of a hustler
I'll show you, how to invest your mail get client tail
I'll show you mo'fuckers, how to protect your sales
You looking at a heavy weighter, check your scale
Cause I'm the heart of this city, like the Metro rail nigga

[Hook]

[Chris Ward]
