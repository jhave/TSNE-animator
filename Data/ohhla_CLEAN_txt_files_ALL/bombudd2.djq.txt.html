Whoaoy whoaoy
Lord have mercy

Sometimes I smoke and I fell over joyed
Sometimes I smoke and I feel paranoid
Sometimes I smoke and I not even feel a thing
Sometimes I smoke and feel Im going insane (lord)
You got the gunja whoaoi
She got the indo whoaoi
He got the sensi whoaoy
Sweet sensi I mean it whoaoy

It make you say
Wha-a-a-ahah-ya-ah-ah-ooa 8x
(We smoking bombudd 4x)

Sometimes I smoke and I become aware
Sometimes I smoke and I dont even care
So this is for my homie Jake who rest in peace
He used to grow in all the multi colonies (right)

He had the gunja whoaoy
He had the indo whoaoy
He had the sensi whoaoy
Sweet sensi I mean it

It makes you say
Wha-a-a-ahah-ya-ah-ah-ooa16x
(We smoking bobmudd)15x

You got the gunja whoaoy
She got the indo whoaoy whoaoy
He got the sensi whoaoy
Sweet sensi I mean it whoaoy
It make you say

Wha-a-a-ahah-ya-ah-ah-ooa
(We smoking bombudd)    fades out until end</pre>
