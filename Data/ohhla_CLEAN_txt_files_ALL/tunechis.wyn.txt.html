[Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck these niggaz..

Tunechi's back! Tunechi's back!
That's all these bitches screamin that, Tunechi's back!
+All Eyes on Me+, nigga picture I'm rollin
Strapped up with that Mac, masked up like a goalie
Man, my bitch on that coke, she snorted fo' and a baby
Now the bitch owe me, she sellin pussy and pay me
They sayin Tunechi's back! Tunechi's back!
And I bought them twins with me nigga: Click and Clack, let's go

Out on bail, work on the scale
Put some change on ya head, boy you on sale
Yeah I'll see you in hell, pop-pop get well
Make breakfast 'cause I got you walkin on egg shells
Zan with that lean, I ain't a beggin motherfucker but nigga please~! 
And I aim this motherfucker at yo' memories 
and all my niggaz Bloods but we make you niggaz bleed... yeah, Bloody Mary!
I'm the one with the money so I ain't the one with the gun
All I do is give the word, to the one with the gun
I'm triple O.G., Fuc's splittin the Sweet
Fuck bitches, get money - mission complete
Man fuck these niggasz I ain't worried 'bout 'em
These niggaz pure pussy, pull a pearl out 'em
Yeah, I got a +Virgin+ I call her Madonna..
But I ain't trippin, her head is a monster!
Yeah, we do this f'real
Swear to God I never shoot unless I'm shootin to kill
Young wild muddahfucker, pop you and a pill
Boy instead of writin raps, you should be writin your will
You a dead man, I get to poppin this bitch
Watch where yo' head land, I ain't right I swear to God 
I need my head scanned, stand up and eat that pussy 
while she on a head stand, I'm a dog hoe 
Camo cargos, semi autos
My bitch sniff more lines than a barcode, yeah!
Wish I could take a shot of Ciroc with Pac
Sorry 4 the Wait 'til my album drop</pre>
