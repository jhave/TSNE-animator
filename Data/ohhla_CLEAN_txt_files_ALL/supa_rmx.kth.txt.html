[Kool Keith]
Supa Supreme... super scheme
Supa Supreme.. super scheme

The Screen Actors Guild is overcrowded with nothin right now
Everybody's bluffin right now
Wastin film and camera time, tryin to expose yourself
to the masses with a camera rhyme
New York and Hollywood don't need you there
Better people than you comin from North, South Caroline
You just a shipmate, ready for me to Elimidate
Cancel your network, feed the canaries that's right y'all
Now you're officially over
Independent, doin pet work, like Mike Jock &amp; Jam
At the BET Awards
Your tight plucked fanbase, give me the applause
Like you a hype man
For one mile then, walkin out the arena doors
I don't care about braggin in the radio game
It's all about the radio flame
You could be seen and dealt with, security guards
And so-called tough guys with black eyes
Put an arrowhead water with ice packs on your jaws

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Supa Supreme... super scheme
Supa Supreme.. super scheme

[Kool Keith]
The sperm blaster, mic controller
Urinary faster, shit on you bastards
Walk and skip sail at Sony studios restroom
Piss on your masters, leave the Neumann wet
Plush conference major nut minor with 30 on the table
Cloud fables, enter the room
Pissy diapers on top of the bagles
You shocked Danny Aina, can't get past Flip
Secretaries try to front
Leave the lobbies full of shit worser than anthrax
And the Atlantic Records colon cleaner on your desk
Your ass so clogged up, niggaz talkin shit
with hemerrohids and Gas-X
You fuckin with the superhero nigga
Bronx Detention Center, a/k/a Mass X
Fuck XR with four sawed offs in the trunk
Fuck y'all, I'm strippin everybody
I'm gettin gassy next

[Chorus] - repeats to 3:05 of track</pre>
