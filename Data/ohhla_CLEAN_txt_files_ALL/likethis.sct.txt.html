Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
You don't got no plug, you can't talk like this
All these free bands make me walk with a limp
Gotta have a ticket just to rap bout bricks
You searching for a plug then you gonn get hit
You gotta be a boss to live a life like this
Distribute a lot of bricks to wear a chain like this
Every day I'm in the trap, I put my life at risk
Stop watching documentaries, at the end they snitch
John Gotti, the only nigga kept it real in the end
Meet you 2, I salute y'all for keeping it real
Never snitch, never fall, that's the life I live
In the booth I put the stove, I got crack adlib, I say

[Chorus]
You gotta to have a check nigga to talk like this
You gotta have a connect just to walk like this
These niggas have these diamonds hit on my wrist
I got at least 20 bad bitches on my dick
You gotta have a million just to flex like this
I bet you gotta be rich to wake up with my chick
I swear to God man these broke niggas make me sick
You gotta be a bad to walk up forth like this

[Verse 2]
I was balling for the deal, I'm a trapper for real
If you ain't got a biggie, you don't know how I feel
I spent a million in Vegas, I spent a million in lives
I spent 2 million to cars, I spent 5 million in cribs
You say you eat pussy nigga but I'm seein you reel
You say you serve me but nigga you ah teller the feel
I spent a million on jewelry, I spent a million on weed
You roll your blunt out of 35, I roll my blunts out of P's
I bought so many ballers, I don't even wan see the bills
They said a hunned 50 thousand, I said is you for real?
On round for get on the pill, I pay 2k for the wheels
It's a good day for a party, I bought my price with the seals

[Chorus]
You gotta to have a check nigga to talk like this
You gotta have a connect just to walk like this
These niggas have these diamonds hit on my wrist
I got at least 20 bad bitches on my dick
You gotta have a million just to flex like this
I bet you gotta be rich to wake up with my chick
I swear to God man these broke niggas make me sick
You gotta be a bad to walk up forth like this</pre>
