Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
(Future)
Blow that money like a candle block
Blow that kush like a candle block
(Ludah, astronaut, astronaut)
Blow that money like a candle block
(Big rock up)
Blow that kush like a candle

[Chorus]
I got brick fare on me right now and I'll blow it
40 racks stuffed down in my denim, I'll blow it
Take a gram of kush and roll it in a blunt, I blow it
What I spent today you spend it in a month, yea I blow it
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow that kush like a candle
(Big money music)
Blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow that kush like a candle

[Verse 1]
What a bird go for? (Go for)
I got that in my coat (That in my coat)
Say 35 racks?
I could buy a kilo
Put the Gucci skully on (Put the Gucci skully on)
Help me think a little better (Help me think a little better)
Stuff the cash in my denim (Stuff the cash in my denim)
Blowing racks on blow (Racks on ice)
All the drugs I make (All the drugs I make)
I need a gold medal
I'm first place
All the songs got played (All the songs got played)
Wrote a mill or better (Wrote a mill or better)
I blow the strongest dope
I drink the strongest lean
When I hit the scene
You see racks of jeans
Think I printed it up, like a copy machine
Y'all niggaz forgave, for trying to copy my team
I blow them bands (I blow them bands)
Like ceiling fans (Like ceiling fans)
Stay chasing paper (Stay chasing paper)
Like a Taliban (Like a Taliban)
I'm freeband, La Familia (My family)
I got benjamins, talking to bunch of them

[Chorus]
I got brick fare on me right now and I'll blow it
40 racks stuffed down in my denim, I'll blow it
Take a gram of kush and roll it in the blunt, I blow it
What I spent today you spend it in a month, yea I blow it
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow that kush like a candle
Blow, blow that money like a candle (Yea, if anybody knows about blowin money, it's me)
Blow, blow that kush like a candle

[Verse 2]
Just bought a 458 (Bought a 458)
Cost 300 racks (Cost 300 racks)
Ludacris I'm a legend (God damn right)
So I still drive in my Ac' (Still drive in my Ac')
Took two years off (Took two years off)
Just to raise my cup (Just to raise my cup)
Worth a hundred fucking men (Worth a hundred fucking men)
Niggaz can't keep up (Niggaz can't keep up)
What you're making in a year (What you're making in a year)
I blow it in a week (I blow it in a week)
Just built a guest house (Just built a guest house)
3000 square feet (3000 square feet)
Everything go to waste (Everything go to waste)
Too much money in the way (Too much money in the way)
Just built a b-ball court (just built a b-ball court)
Nigga don't even play (Nigga don't even play)
What the fuck?
I got enough weed to fill a hundred thousand blunts
Bought a playground at the crib, my daughter played on that shit once
Got a safe filled up with dirty money like Kaleena
Got a tennis court rotting cuz it's waiting for Serena

[Chorus]
I got brick fare on me right now and I'll blow it
40 racks stuffed down in my denim, I'll blow it
Take a gram of kush and roll it in the blunt, I blow it
What I spent today you spend it in a month, yea I blow it
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow that kush like a candle
Blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow that kush like a candle

[Verse 3]
Want some blow
Or to rent a boat
Nigga need a bigger both
For all this blow
How you getting doe?
You ain't got nothing to blow
Fuck out of here with your blow
The rich who blow, got it from a new blow
Actually It's old blow
It was gone for, you can say blow
Show me 700 for, by all means I was going to blow
Partner made that, hop in the Enzo
Yea that bitch gotta blow
Better tie her to the car and the deed to your house
Yea nigga, I'ma blow your bitch
(I'm blowin)
Blowin money, blowin strong
Swear that's all I blow (that's all I blew)
All them blow days gone
You're the whore
Had to get me something to blow, so I went to California
Bought at California
I just want to blow their brain
Infatuated with horses
I just need them in my paint (Rarri)
Make me feel the power, blow that money every hour

[Chorus]
I got brick fare on me right now and I'll blow it
40 racks stuffed down in my denim, I'll blow it
Take a gram of kush and roll it in the blunt, I blow it
What I spent today you spend it in a month, yea I blow it
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow that kush like a candle
Blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow that kush like a candle</pre>
