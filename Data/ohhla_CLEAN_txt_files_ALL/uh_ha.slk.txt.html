Clothes lines, we moves prime time(uh ha)
Movies, endorsments, we run it bottom line(uh ha)
Entrepeuners
Ghettto niggas still break laws(uh ha)
Walk around strapped packin' twin four, fours(uh ha)
Niggas gossip like bitches, they ain't ready for war(uh ha)
This ain't a threat, it's a promise, leave you dead on tha floor(uh ha)
Wit your brain on tha wall

There's a big difference between battle &amp; war(uh ha)
In battle you live, in war you die,your gone(uh ha)

Chorus(2X)

[Silkk]
Anybody that thank it's not, look tha money didn't change us(uh ha)
What they should be thankin', look tha money made us dangerous(uh ha)
I always wanted money, I never wanted to be famous(uh ha)
An I don't fuck wit to many entertainers cause they just entertainers
(uh ha)Tha type to act up usually after they jacked(uh ha)
Wanna wild out but usually way after tha fact(uh ha)
Fo' dot half a dozen, you can catch me in dat(uh ha)
I'm a business man so I'm even cool way after tha rap(uh ha)
No Limit whodi, you know I'm banked up(uh ha)
Summer time tank top, winter time I'm manked up(uh ha)
I be's where it's cold but mostly where it's hot(uh ha)
Yall might see sometimes but mostly yall not(uh ha)
I be in tha hills sometimes but mostly upon tha block(uh ha)
Be on tha land sometime but mostly on a yacht(uh ha)
You can catch me in tha hood just passin' out thousands(uh ha)
Probaly by tha Callio &amp; change tha name to Vyshonne King Miller housin'
(uh ha)Oh it ain't my fault, you know I do's my thang(uh ha)
Never gonna change, let me explain(uh ha)
Do like revolvers, don't like rifles, do like teks(uh ha)
Do like four play, don't like talkin', do like sex(uh ha)
I do like Clue, Jam, Capri, do like Flex(uh ha)
I do like cash, don't like credit, but I do like checks(uh ha)
If you know me then you know what's best(uh ha)
Gold, platinum, double platinum, if you can add, you know what's next
(uh ha)
