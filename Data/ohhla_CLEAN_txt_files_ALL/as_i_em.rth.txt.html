[Chorus: D.A.]
Take me as I am, my friends, ain't gonna change, won't be no end
Write these songs, rock these shows, only good life I know

[Verse 1: Asher Roth] + (D.A.)
I was in 7th grade when I heard the Slim Shady LP
Yea, my mom brought it down when I was ironing... irony
Getting out the wrinkles, just a little kid in middle school
Sink my teeth into anything, to think I'm cool
Riding the bus, I feel the rush from "I Still Don't Give a Fuck"
I wish I could agree, but I've already had enough
I've already given up, from playing the same game
Every interview, feel like I'm saying the same thing
Em was great, yea he paved the way for me
He was inspiration for everyone from A to Z
But they keep relating me, I can't get away, chasing me
(All Day Long) I hear it (All Day Long)
Now the masses think that Asher wants to be a Marshall Mathers
They say "Asher's not a rapper, nah his ass is just an actor"
Cause we have the same complexion and similar voice inflection
It's easy to see the pieces and reach for that connection
Each second of every minute, each hour of every day
I'm constantly on the fence, defending my own name
Explaining we're not the same
There's not much that I can say, except that I'm sick of it
Critics, I've only sparked up a flame, it's on...

Chorus x2

[Verse 2: Asher Roth] + (D.A.)
Now, don't get it twisted, I've definitely benefited
It's like suddenly everyone wants to hear what I be spittin'
So different, the image, they don't get it
It's simple, I'm just a kid who wants to rap to make a living
But Em was in it way before I committed
And his lyrics were the shit so I really gotta come with it (gotta go hard)
But each critic be picking apart my writtens
If it isn't up to par than Asher Paul is just a gimmick (fucking joke)
Is it my fault? Must I be more convincing?
Y'all talk all ya want, never halt me from my mission
Use it as ammunition, would you keep please dissing me?
(All Day Long) I hear it (All Day Long)
And yeah the haters wanna hate me cause I made it and I'm famous
But until you take my place, you'll never know bout what it takes
To make a record for respect, take a second to inspect
When you look like someone else, then what the fuck do you expect?
I just want to be accepted as the illest in the game
But it's harder for an artist creating his own lane
That's synonymous with rhyming and combined with perfect timing
On the time I got left declining and bout to explode so hold on

Chorus x2

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
So fuck it, that's all I got, there's nothing else for me to say
If I don't confront the problem, then it will never go away
Unless it is addressed, there is nothing left for me to do
It's impossible rejecting the elephant in the room

Say goodbye to all the bullshit, notions pre-conceived
So long to all the blogs, coulda sworn they knew me
If you have no further questions and can't think of other thoughts
Then I'd like to introduce you to Asher Paul Roth, dawg

Chorus x2</pre>
