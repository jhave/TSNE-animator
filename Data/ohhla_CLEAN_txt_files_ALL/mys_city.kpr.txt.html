[Antonio Chance aka Shanghai the Messenger]	[Killah Priest]
I've found a star		[what's deal god, I heard you got some]
I've found a star		[bad news about Killah Priest, ya know]
I've found a star		[out here, right now it's madness]
where do we go from here	[things going on, word, shooting up]
after the storm is clear	[lotta cops, ya know what I'm sayin]
where do we go from here	[it's madness that's going on in the]
after the storm is clear...	[world today, so what I've gotta do is]
				[open up my mind, and then try to, ya ]
				[know, take it from there, from what I]
				[can build, ya know what I'm saying?  ]
				[cuz, ain't nobody gonna, nobody gonna]
				[look out for me...]

[Killah Priest]
It's the end of the road, It's like the red moon
over Tibet, theory of the 12 monkeys, left in this cold war hungry
we kill over blood money, the cops seem to think it's funny
we murder over pennys and crumbs, plenty of guns
crammed in the city slums, the man pity none
for this next millenium, kids starving when they breath
you can see they kidneys and lungs, they left blind, skinny and dum
sights far from a pretty one, praying to god, when will he come
but half of my crew is atheists
while the other halfs waiting on a spaceship, I can't take it
screaming life is what you make it, so called fake-friends
they all snakes in the end, trying to hide they face
try to blend one mistake, I see them grin
try to say we have the same king, cuz we have the same skin
I live amongst the unholy, we all role weed, thick as Jamaican rollies
until the lords scold me, and told me, you'll be my next Moses
go sake the hopeless and homeless, with eviction notice
arrive like the infant Joseph, with a grudge to Ceasar
like the blood of Jesus, I told the Judge they don't love us
we don't love um' either
my sword would drink the blood of an un-believer
my sword would drink the blood of an un-believer
my sword would drink the blood of an un-believer
my sword would drink the blood of an un-believer

where do we go from here		[where do we go from here]
after the storm has cleared		[after that storm has cleared]
where do we go from here		[like nights over Tibet]
after the storm has cleared...

[Killah Priest]
my home is where the physco rage, spending long nights and cold days
inside a bible cage, is it the curse of a bible plague
welcome, to the cyber age, the air's burning like a microwave
the holy lands sees miles away, I pour out some alisae, beneath the skies
cuz the clouds are grey, ? piles of graves of the older slaves
reptiles araise, from out the caves they invade
the dirt under my nails got a story to tell
I wrestle with angels like Michael L, spending nights in Jail
beneath the hells dungeon, with the drunkest tounge kids
we all haunted and unwanted, forgotten city
where the air stays hot and misty, I see crack fiends with rotten titties
twist the top off a whisky, east the block is risky
that's why my shots empty, till the cops come and get me
I stay in green camoflage, I see camels on mars
already stars, scanning are cars, world famine at large
they got us trapped like ak and ak and the ?
I'm looking for the city of gold, I pity the soul
they take you man, so start ?, I'm like ?
it's like the 6 points of the hexagram
resembles the sex of man, all my children in Bethlehem
I dropped the tek out my hand, dropped to the earth
caresed the sand, yes I understand now, I heard a voice say
come hither, I walk while others slither, lead me to my fathers river

where do we go from here..		[where do we go]
after the storm has cleared..		[beneath the red moon, skies moan]
where do we go from here..		[where do we go from here]
after the storm has cleared..		[after the storm is clear]
where do we go, we go..			[bound man is desolate]
after the storm has cleared, the storm has cleared...
[we love amongst the]
where do we go, from here, where do we go		
[less infectionate]
after the storm has cleared.. the storm has cleared
[and the seperatist]
where do we go, from here, from here	[travel at the end of the]
after the storm has cleared..		[road, looking for the]
where do we go, away from here		[gold, it's like that]
after the storm has cleared..		[honesty, love, peace]
					[and happiness..]</pre>
