OK player, pull up a chair
I'm Aceyalone and I'm runnin for mayor
That's just the intro as if you cared
Pimps, hos, nymphos, tricks, and squares
I'd like to introduce you to a true rhyme sayer
Born Californian in west LA-er
I like to hear the beat right under the snare
And my love hold tight like you huggin a bear (OK player)

Players and playerettes and babies and pimps
Ready, Set, Go let your mind connect
Maybe even you ladies with the funny cigarettes
And my man playin the backboard like he was a vet
I mean, check my scroll again when I come rollin in
Strollin in holdin in my hand a mighty scepter
I'm in ya sector, I'm ya selector
Don't worry about nothing I'm gon be ya party protector
All I want you to do is just move with the record
Master ya high and control ya laker
I'm stylin and growl like a German Sheppard
I just come through clean like the heath inspector (OK Player)

OK player, pull up a chair
I'm Aceyalone and I'm runnin for mayor
That's just the intro as if you cared
Pimps, hos, nymphos, tricks, and squares
I'd like to introduce you to a true rhyme sayer
Born Californian in west LA-er
I like to hear the beat right under the snare (Yeah)
And my love hold tight like you huggin a bear (Yeah, OK player)

As long as your feelin good that's all that matters
But don't get caught in the same old patterns
Look to the sky and climb up the ladder
Cuz I mix up the batter like a real mad hatter
People get together it's a beautiful thing
With the beat drop down like that's the swing
Hit the mic screamin like I wanna be king
And keep the party rockin like What did he bring?
I brought love and a gang of choppers
A lil something new for ya regular shopper
Break 'em off proper and get my propers
Pull out the stoppers (Yeah, OK Player)

OK player, pull up a chair
I'm Aceyalone and I'm runnin for mayor
That's just the intro as if you cared
Pimps, hos, nymphos, tricks, and squares
I'd like to introduce you to a true rhyme sayer
Born Californian in west LA-er
I like to hear the beat right under the snare
And my love hold tight like you huggin a bear (Yeah, OK player)

When I get to rockin the house they stop and stare
Hands ain't the only thing they put in the air
The night gets bright when I light the flare
(OK player OK Player)
Fellas in the house let me know if ya there
Ladies scream if you got clean underwear
Bonecrusher said he'd never be scared
And Andre said he'd lay in ya hair
Me I'm so smooth and debonair
My style so rare, beyond compare
Kinda like the people living under the stair (OK Player)
