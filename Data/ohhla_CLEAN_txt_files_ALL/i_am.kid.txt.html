Hey dude, you recordin'

Well fire it up, chop one out, somebody's got to know
That I'm two days in, I got two days left to go
Cause I am Georgia, I am Memphis, Tennessee
I am everything that Hollywood wants to be
I am love and I am hate, I'm your late night drunk debate
But you'll never put your finger on me

Have you ever seen the sun over the rocky mountains shinin'
Or touched the sands of a southern Florida beach
Have you seen a grown man cry or a child that's slowly dying
Have you looked inside to see all that you can see
And I am North and South Dakota, and New York City
I am everything Hollywood wants to be
I am love and I am hate, and the critics can all debate
But they'll never put a finger on me
No you'll never put your finger on

Ohh, ohh, hey, hey
Ohh, ohh, yeah, eh, yeah, eh, hey, hey

Have you seen the Northern falls or the midwest seasons changing
A Montana storm, or warm Kentucky rain
Have you heard the love that sings over inner city sidewalks
Have you risen above all that leads to hate

And I am Boston and D.C., and all of Detroit city
I am everything that Hollywood wants to be
I am Southern rock n roll, country and hip-hop and soul
And you'll never put your finger on me
I'm a fater and I'm a friend, I'm your brother until the end
But you'll never put your finger on me
I am "Only God Knows Why", I'll be a "Cowboy" till I die
But you'll never put your finger on me

You'll never put your finger on me, you'll never put it on, put it on, on me
You'll never put, never put it on, put it, put it on, hey, never put it on
You'll never put, never, never, never, never, never, never
Put your finger on me</pre>
