Song:   Reach for the Stars
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Why they say the sky is the limit
When I've seen the footprints on the moon
Why they say the sky is the limit
When I've seen the footprints on the moon
And I know the sky might be high
But baby it ain't really that high
And I know that mars might be far
But baby it ain't really that far
Let's reach for the stars

Reach for the stars
Let's reach for the stars
Reach for the stars
Let's reach for the stars
Reach for the stars
Let's reach for the stars

(let me see your hands up)

Can't nobody hold us back
They can't hold us down
They can't keep us back
Tiers to the ground
Told your people that we don't mess around
When we're trying out
Please don't turn this down
We will turn it up
Louder than it was before
Like the lion at the jungle, you can hear us roar
When I lie hear, it's like a sonic blaster
Flying just like nasa, out of space master

Hands up, reach for the stars
Hands up, get 'em up high
Hands up, if you really feel alive
Live it up, live it up

Why they say the sky is the limit
When I've seen the footprints on the moon
Why they say the sky is the limit
When I've seen the footprints on the moon
And I know the sky might be high
But baby it ain't really that high
And I know that mars might be far
But baby it ain't really that far
Let's reach for the stars

Reach for the stars
Let's reach for the stars
Reach for the stars
Let's reach for the stars
Reach for the stars
Let's reach for the stars

(let me see your hands up)</pre>
