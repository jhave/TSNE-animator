[Chorus]
These the days of my life
Niggas gotta go hard
Real niggas step up from frauds
Gotta put money before them broads
These the days of my life
Extra money I'm maxing
To get it much I'm on a stratch
And I tell her I'mma flex
These the days of my life
I'm living how I want to
Stunting like I want to
Winning is what I'm gone do
These the days of my life
I'm living how I want to
Stunting like I want to
Winning is what I'm gone do

[Verse 1]
These days of my life
Gotta go hard for my money
I can?'t retrust no bitches
Never put a bitch before my younging
I been locked up, oh yeah
Ain'?t got mailed or sent money
But I know the shit was coming
Cause this life all bout stunting
I be reckless
Ballin' like I'm Texan
Go hard cause I'm flexin'
My wrist cost me a mansion
Double all my rolls Royce
100 team I got no choice
These niggas don?t make no noise
Hell yeah, I'm cocky
Niggas bet they can?'t stop me
Beat the Case like I'm Rocky
Bad bitch wanna top me
Niggas wanna drop me
L's up for my hittas
Tell them free my niggas
Balling hard with my niggas
Everyday get silly

[Chorus]
These the days of my life
Niggas gotta go hard
Real niggas step up from frauds
Gotta put money before them broads
These the days of my life
Extra money I'm maxing
To get it much I'm on a stratch
And I tell her I'mma flex
These the days of my life
I'm living how I want to
Stunting like I want to
Winning is what I'm gone do
These the days of my life
I'm living how I want to
Stunting like I want to
Winning is what I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Yeah, pop off pop off
The champagne top I pop off
Days of my life
Real shit no knock off
Gotta go get bread
Molly girl, molly head
You know without me you losing
These stupid bitches choosing
Only The Family know how I feel about them
?I can do no deal without them
I can?'t even live without them
Yeah, and I'mma climb up to the top
Money up and it wi?ll not drop
Foreign cars with foreign broads
Niggas mad cause we gone eat
24/7 bitch no sleep
All these niggas they hating on me
All these bitches they hating on me
Ride around and I? get it nigga
Smoking loud with no music
Gotta go out and get it nigga

[Chorus]
These the days of my life
Niggas gotta go hard
Real niggas step up from frauds
Gotta put money before them broads
These the days of my life
Extra money I'm maxing
To get it much I'm on a stratch
And I tell her I'mma flex
These the days of my life
I'm living how I want to
Stunting like I want to
Winning is what I'm gone do
These the days of my life
I'm living how I want to
Stunting like I want to
Winning is what I'm gone</pre>
