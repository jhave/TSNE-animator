[Rasaq]
Texas boys roll SLAB's rollin' slow and never fast
Cuz we sittin' on glass, and we showin' off this cash
On the mash, tryna multiply the stash
Bump yo gums and make us mad we gon' get up in yo ass
Like a rash when a Texas boy act,
that's yo toe up in a tag, and ya body in a bag
We ain't usually this mad, usually we zag
Let the bumper-kit drag, and we blowin' on grass
Trunk on blast, sippin' on my last
Rollin' down the Ave., in I rolled down the rag
You see them DVD's, you see them 8 TV's
You see that Pioneer, Clarion and that JVC
You see them lad-ies on my n-u-t'z
Down here it's country tunes we don't mess with MC's
I'ma hold it down, we gon' slow it down
Recline and blow a pound, put this hoe up in rewind
 - Uh, now what you know about us, (What yall know about them Texas boys)
come up in the club and we lean by the cuffs
Uh, now what you know about us, (What yall know about them Texas boys)
5th wheel on the trunk, hit a switch and lift it up
Uh, now what you know about me, (What yall know about them Texas boys)
S-L-A-B, sittin' on "23's
Uh, now what you know about T,-E to the X-A-S,
we some G's

What yall know about them Texas boys
Comin down in candy toys, comin' down in candy toys..
What yall-What yall know about them Texas,
What yall know about them Texas boys, comin' down in candy toys..
