Uh yea, Half-A-Mill, Quintay Soul
Uh, you know how we do, just the things we do baby

[Chorus: Quintay Soul] **repeat 2X**
You did things for me -- I did things for you
The things you did for me no one else could do

[Verse 1]
Ma you know you kept it realer than most girls
Gave me the best of both worlds and I love you for that
When I was on the run came to your crib snuck in the back
Your moms woke up yellin "Who the....was that"
You showed me love, even though I sold 'em drug
Out in the streets rollin wit thugs
I came home to hug you, held the crib down
days I had to skip town
Your bad work for me, put clips and pounds
You was still around when the chips was down
Its no more 'ficial chips its 'ficial Cristal now we eatin
You know we goin out this evenin, lets hit a club or sumthin
Prolly smoke an ounce of of Eton
You wore the thug stuntin, and we gonna bounce this weekend
Fly down to Hawaiian Islands lounge on the beach
You my sweet thing full of complete flames
Burnin desire, got mine soul on fire, wooa!

[Chorus: Quintay Soul] **repeat 2X**
You did things for me -- I did things for you
The things you did for me no one else could do

[Verse 2]
You was there physically and mentally
Aint just he material that seal the bond 'tween me and you
Its the feelings we shared, the unity
The attitude like you ain't nuttin to prove to me
You a beauty be the wonderful list, view to me
We tongue kiss in sex, and we crushin the sets
Thug lovin, my stick shift touchin your buttons
Got you nutin like nuttin before
Ma's its nuttin for me to please you
Girlfriend I need you
I fly over the highest mountain just to see you
I walk over the water if you ask me to
I even cross the border wit a package or too
And bring the cash back to you, I want your stash facts too
You got my name tattooed in your back, and that's true
Its natural, you held me down and that's true
Its natural, you held me down and that's true

[Chorus: Quintay Soul] **repeat 2X**
You did things for me -- I did things for you
The things you did for me no one else could do

[Verse 3]
I could neva forget the things you did for me
That's why you get blamed cuz I'm gettin changed
We takin a trip to Spain, I'm gettin braid in the plane
Sunshine or rain, international ball
I gotta a girl and I'mma spoil her
So what I bought her, ma what else you wanna order
I pick 'em nice and sweet like Oranges in Florida
I made a movie startin her, love of my life
I can picture us as husband and wife
You see me strugglin strife
when things got tight you'll rub me on my back
say its gonna be alright
At times I was in the streets all-night
Wit fiend's all-night, it was even hard for you to sleep all-night
No need to worry if I'm freakin or cheatin, I got a strong wife
plan to live a long life, baby boo you all right
I give light that make the stars bright
You're my reflection, my destiny is your in my direction, come on

[Chorus: Quintay Soul] **repeat 2X**
You did things for me -- I did things for you
The things you did for me no one else could do

[Outro: Quintay Soul]
No one else could do the things you did for me
All the things I did for you</pre>
