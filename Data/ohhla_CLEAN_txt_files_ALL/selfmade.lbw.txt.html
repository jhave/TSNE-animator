Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Man I go hard, live young, die alone
Too many bad bitches, I don't ever check my phone
I ball hard, man I'm in my zone
YMC king, sitting on the throne
My shit the bomb, wake up early, getting it, I'm gone
Everything with me right, if you don't fuck with me then you wrong
I ball hard, man I'm in my zone
Self-made nigga, yea I did it on my own

[Verse 1]
We go hard nigga, way harder than ya'll niggaz
Find me up in the mall nigga, probably blowin racks on your broad nigga
Tryna heat it up, all on my D Wade shit
New kicks, can't find, he's an East Bay bitch
Got a daughter now, gotta make my daughter proud
In Ohio, do you know how much respect I get?
Got here all by myself
With no assistance, with no help
Pretty's giving all these new rappers so much height
When these motherfuckers ain't even done nothin yet
Last week I made 100 flat
I'm sellin out shows, I was in Japan
They don't even speak my language
But the motherfuckers know who I am
Niggaz cryin broke on that TO shit
Man west flow, I'm on my CEO shit
All this gold I got on me, don't I look like C3PO bitch?
(Hey, look at me)
Mind on my cheddar, I got paper on my mind
Murda rappers for a living and you next up in line
In equisals with a bitch, then you know that she a diamond
All it take is one call, so don't you get outta line (sucka!)
We getting it, now what the fuck ya'll doin?
Cash money, young money, bitch we fuckin do it

[Chorus]
Man I go hard, live young, die alone
Too many bad bitches, I don't ever check my phone
I ball hard, man I'm in my zone
YMC king, sitting on the throne
My shit the bomb, wake up early, getting it, I'm gone
Everything with me right, if you don't fuck with me then you wrong
I ball hard, man I'm in my zone
Self-made nigga, yea I did it on my own

[Verse 2]
Mob livin, painting my city on my ceiling
We ain't trippin, we just trickin, tax cash money endless
Whole team winnin, sees Versace in em
License plates say you so crazy they think Martin in it
You watch yo limit to fly, nigga I'm an attendant
Don't play me hard, I keep a shot, give her the rainis
One pop hop, fakes gathered a real pop up
Man we don't care about you or your crew, word to papa
Sayin shit that you got every day a different watch
Cartier, call the cops, sweepin these niggaz like where's the mop?
Pull off the top, closer to God
Stash in the glove box
This will knock yo head off, you can call it body crop
Photo shop, quiet, I'm the shtt like a soda pop
Call me Georgia stadium, yea I get that dome a lot
Okay, young with money, cash money ha
You don't know about it, come and find out

[Chorus]
Man I go hard, live young, die alone
Too many bad bitches, I don't ever check my phone
I ball hard, man I'm in my zone
YMC king, sitting on the throne
My shit the bomb, wake up early, getting it, I'm gone
Everything with me right, if you don't fuck with me then you wrong
I ball hard, man I'm in my zone
Self-made nigga, yea I did it on my own

[Verse 3]
Ya'll know who it is! Let em know
Every single time you niggaz see a nigga pull up in the spot
How about it when I come in and I pull up in the drop
When I come in and I cock and pull the trigga and then I pop
Yea, nigga see I'm doing it again
God in the flesh and I'm killin
I'm a move it, I'm more calm than I'm fresh
Killin em, abusing em and beatin niggaz all up in the head while I'm losin em
Back back back at it, let's go
Everything about me be the shit you wanna get with
Niggaz got my man, count my money kinds different
Fuck that, I'm about to get a little ignant
Blap! Ah nigga, never mind, let it blow
Looks it when yo nigga shine with a glow
Man you probably need to go and get up here and change
I know what you're gleaming, I know what you're gleamin
I'm with you by the nigga though
Damn, mm mm, you don't really wanna do that nigga
Fall back come come now now
Trust me, violent my little bro and I won't be the nigga out for my nigga Bow Wow
The merry the body, in one of my compounds
Ya'll know what they do
Motherfucker better bow down!
And let me get my money up
Every weird bitch, even when I'm travellin to Moscow
When I get up on these records and I spit
It be soundin like a nigga getting beat up with a shovel
YMCMB!
Just brought a nigga in, now all of the motherfuckers in trouble
When ya'll niggaz get up on records
It be soundin like ya'll niggaz do a lot of soft right after you see a motherfucker like me come through
Ya'll niggaz stay, say enough and buh!

[Chorus]
Man I go hard, live young, die alone
Too many bad bitches, I don't ever check my phone
I ball hard, man I'm in my zone
YMC king, sitting on the throne
My shit the bomb, wake up early, getting it, I'm gone
Everything with me right, if you don't fuck with me then you wrong
I ball hard, man I'm in my zone
Self-made nigga, yea I did it on my own</pre>
