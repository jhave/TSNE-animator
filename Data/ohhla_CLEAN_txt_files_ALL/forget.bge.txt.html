[Verse 1]
Nigga me fall off, could never be soft
Forget about it
Win at all cost, born to be raw
Forget about it
Do I bust with my tec, over respect
Forget about it
Did I get me rap name from my irrect
Forget about it
Am I ???? up in hoes, over on all fo's
Forget about it
Do I like my shit blowed and then she swallows
Forget about it
I did ??? on the tank, chop with the shank
Forget about it
I left to make bank, you think that I ain't
Forget about it
Nigga get'n these Bens, on no top tens
Forget about it
Never make business with friends, business with kins
Forget about it
You bedda not beef with the man, now nigga you can
Forget about it
Hit you with this gat in my hands, then I smile and
Forget about it
You hear the shot its too late, ain't gon' escape
Forget about it
If were out on a date, there's lots in stake
Forget about it 
It's just me an you boo, you know how we do
Forget about it
I bust once, you got two, you thought I was threw
Forget about it
  
[Chorus 2X]
Forget about it, For-get
Forget about it, forget about it, forget about it
For-get, forget about it
Forget about it Forget about it
For-get, forget about it
forget about it, forget about it, forget about it, forget about it, forget about it
  
[Verse 2]
When I walk in the club I always get love
Forget about it
I hit a dap to my thugs, Women get hugs
Forget about it
Fonies get mugged, haters to slugs
Forget about it
Get left in the mud, get your ass drugged
Forget about it
I get ???? from the hood, man I never would
Forget about it
As a souljah a stood, me go Hollywood
Forget about it
What I leave my snitches and trick, fast with a flitch
Forget about it
Sucka phat dick, dying and shit
Forget about it
Do I ride fo' my doggs, down for the cause
Forget about it
Do I like fine brawds, in G string drawers
Forget about it
I hit it all night, loving it tight
Forget about it
I make you say aiight, pillows you bight
Forget about it
Keep my gat by my sac, never leave that
Forget about it
Blow your ass off the map, trained for combat
Forget about it
Special Forces fo'sho, ready for war
Forget about it
Breaking the law, whatever you saw
Forget about it
  
[Chorus x4]</pre>
