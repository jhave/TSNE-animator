[Introduction]
Gorillaz
Back the fuck up
D12

[Proof]
There ain't no trouble in rock (rock)
On every block (block)
Late for School, Late for Work
But ahead of these cops (cops)
My credit is shock, in the detinate box (box)
Like, people take my life and thats pathetic as Pac's (Pac's)
A waste of the talent, Say my boys is just no where
Placed on the planet, remain in poisonous warfare
Derelict Arabic terrorists in the air
Shit arrogant apparent to punish people by their heritage,
Nato barriers, Hate embarrassed
There is the faith to cherish
In your room face to face with race awareness
A race to s??? army bombin' your God is with you
Calm over war, we gotta start our pistol
Cause if you right and, know you right, then where's your ritious ways
We sacrafice, snatch your life, many nights and days
Follow me into equality we might behave
And only christ can say the trife will reunite again

[Kuniva]
America Owns, Without a fucking care in my dome
Bearin' my bones, so far away staring at home
Stay at my zone, falling asleep late with my chrome
Feelin' hype from these rockets burning like straightenin' in the cones
Stay at the streets, bullshit and plans to beef
Spray at your peeps for christmas, give a K to my neice
Real nigga's feel us and fear us
Gorillaz beat on they chest when
Dangerous lyricist, I hope that you hear us
The spirit of Bugz is still in me
God bless it the trinity
Cause my bullets they come in three's like trilogy's
Put the knife away, missles away strike and blaze
So much smoke you can't tell the difference between night and day
Right away blow your life away, so light your haze
Hold tight grenede's so when it blows I'm slightly grazed
Kuniva might be crazed unleashin' unlikely rage
The next time you hear a verse from me I might be caged

[Chorus]
Aaaahhhiyyyaaaa
Ahhhayayayayay
Aaaahhhiyyyaaaa
Ahhhayayayayay

[Bizarre]
Everynight I talk to a black hawk, taking herion in bulks
Watch my body hit the chalks
I'm too lazy, mescalines got me crazy
Rape this old lady, while the bitch was having a baby
And I ain't never going home, Bizarre can for go
It's cold I'll be for cyphering, right from wrong
As I sit in my seat and remain calm
And close my eyes and wait for the bomb (Here it comes!)

*Airplane Blows Up*

[Swifty]
I'm gettin' the fuck on, I'm aggrivated
I know I'll make it, Im in a place full of hatred
Treatin' my life like a sacrred
Try to check me, I break your neck
Disrespect me you get injected
It's hectic with some bullshit that happen
You least expected
We just don't accept it nigga
I go ahead, lift my trigger
Get rid of bitches, pay you a visit, then get your shit lit
I'm a nitwit with a big dick, and big balls
I don't miss shit
I hit all, whoever that did this
We Gonna Getch'all

[Kon Artis]
Yo, yo
Now whether its Sadam or Bin Laden
Thats been startin all this trouble for us
Creepin horrors doin show after show, sleepin on the tour bus
We lost Aaliyah, lost our families, it takes no Tenges
You dont need us to say the world is fucked up dawgs can see it
Now it seems the public needs this shit to calm its kids
Cuz they findin out how you lied about your twisted sins
They say we bad for you but shit our music is your friend
They cant deter you from the truth cause we the helping hand

[Terry Hall]

We are one, and one is all
We are, We are, we are one
And one is all

[Chorus]</pre>
