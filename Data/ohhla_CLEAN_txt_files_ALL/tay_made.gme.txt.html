Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Game - Chorus]
Let me introduce you to the Taylor gang
That's my nigga Wiz and I'm Chuck Taylor mayne
We both known in our hoods like Chuck Taylors mayne
We get high, fuck hoes, and roll paper planes
Cause we Taylor made, we the Taylor gang
Blowing smoke into the face of those haters mane
We all stars in the hood like Chuck Taylors mane
So throw it up and keep repping the Taylor gang, if you Taylor made

[Game]
I wake up in the morning to Red Converse
Dre Beats on, listening to Bomb first
You got a hangover nigga, mine's worse
Haze got me kicking knowledge like a Nas verse
Shit be complicated like out of towners
trying to understand why we say waddup Blood
but we not related
That's how Compton made it,
so don't run around yelling Soo Woo without a Chuck Taylor confirmation
On that documentary shit I shocked the nation
Muhammad Ali shit like I boxed in Vegas
When it come to beef shit, nigga I'm the greatest
I knew I was next the night they shot Pac in Vegas
I ain't a killer but don't push me
I see a bitch looking, I'mma end up in her pussy
See ya later, fuck haters, cause bitch we Taylors
Bitch we major

[Game - Chorus]
Let me introduce you to the Taylor gang
That's my nigga Wiz and I'm Chuck Taylor mayne
We both known in our hoods like Chuck Taylors mayne
We get high, fuck hoes, and roll paper planes
Cause we Taylor made, we the Taylor gang
Blowing smoke into the face of those haters mane
We all stars in the hood like Chuck Taylors mane
Sso throw it up and keep repping the Taylor gang, if you Taylor made

[Wiz Khalifa Verse]
Probably heard I'm the tightest
And I heard that you never smoked so I rolled it, you light it
And I heard that you liked it
And I welcome you to my world you've been cordially invited
Now I got the whole world excited
Know every word when they heard that I write it
Know I can fuck every girl cause my jewelry the brightest, and my herb is the lightest
Some niggaz mad I made it, blame it all on perfect timing
I say I made it big cause I stuck to the cursive writing
These niggaz rather be a has-been then not be famous at all
I learned you ain't really gotta be famous to ball
I'm hustling hard, and turning bitches to custumers soon as they get in front of us,
Bad hoes after the shows rushing up
Baby them niggaz clowns talk down but they look up to us
May look the same but I'm nothing like them suckas
So fuck what them niggaz sayin' and keep reppin' the gang
