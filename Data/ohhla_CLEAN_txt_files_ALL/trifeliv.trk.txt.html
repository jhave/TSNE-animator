Trife, trife, look, look...

(Verse 1 - Turk)
I been through it all dawg
From killin, to hustlin, to set it off dawg
On the block like it's legal gettin my grind on
When it's hot I'm duckin them people with my fire arm
Look I be straight thuggin
Tha block is where I'm from niggas head bustin'
I told the chopper where the drumb play with me and I'm bumpin'
Dawg, you don't want none of this trouble
Dawg, I shot you when you can't get fixed cousin
I'm Trife Livin, and the only thing I know is the block
How to go get it, when I need it, and a run in your shop
Think I'm not
Look you could be ass if you want
Cock the glocked, throw you dog ass in the truck
I plays it raw
Cause ain't no rules to this shit dawg
Soon as it hit dark, that's when I do you in fall
I'ma guerilla, untamed one at that
From TC to wilder willow is where the real niggas head

(Chorus)
I'm trife livin only thing I know is tha block
How to get it, when I need it, and a run your shop
I'm trife livin for all y'all niggas that think that
I'm notYou could be run up if you want, and I betcha ya get shoot
Whatever it took to survive I was down with it - (*2X*)
Even though if it meant to do or die, I was still with it
Doing bad I'm sick and tired, so I got to get it
If you got it you better hide cause I'm gonna get it

(Verse 2 - Turk)
Why you hustlin?
I'm scopin' you any move that you make
Look here you slip one time, give tha dope, coke and yay
I don't play
I know I look into somebody face
But I'm solo down
I got ten under my weist
No trace, no case
I do my dirt by myself
Round get erased
You get down bad with me round
I'ma spray you down like a roach in tha project
Either get it in your dome, your back, or your chest
If your not from uptown don't come around
My set if you do get chooped down
Nigga I put that on my first son
I'm trife livin disrespect me, cuzen you done

(Chorus)
I'm trife livin only thing I know is tha block
How to get it, when I need it, and a run your shop
Im trife livin for all y'all niggas that think that I'm not
You could be run up if you want, and I betcha ya get shoot
Whatever it took to survive I was down with it
Even though if it meant to die, I was still with it, still with it

(Verse 3 - Turk)
All the house I sold out
Got kick in and bought it up
Now I'm getting my grind on out tha project cuts
Ain't nothin gonna stop me for doing my thang
Fuck sarge and his boys I'ma do my thang
Young and Thuggin I live wild and fall, man
Bout head bustin', look here at any time, man
Nigga like me will never do bad, nigga
Long as they got a gat and a ski mask
Look here I go get me a nigga quick
Duck tape him and bring his ass straight to the bricks
Tell his folks that I want about a half fam
If they don't come with it look, send his head to 'em
That's how I play it, homes
I don't give a fuck about no nigga
Who ever could get fucked
I play for keeps and tha streets fall
Trife livin and that three it's how I live, fall

(Chorus)
I'm trife livin only thing I know is tha block
How to get it, when I need it, and a run your shop
Im trife livin for all y'all niggas that think that I'm not
You could be run up if you want, and I betcha you get shoot
Whatever it took to survive I was down with it
Even if it meant to die, I was still with it
Doing bad I'm sick and tired, so I got to get it
If you got it you better hide cause I'm gonna get it
Cause I'm trife livin' only thing I know is tha block
How to get it, when I need it, and a run your shop
I'm trife livin for all y'all niggas that think that I'm not
You could be run up if you want, and I betcha you get shoot
Whatever it took to survive I was down with it</pre>
