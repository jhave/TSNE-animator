[Intro]
Yes.. yes.. yes

[Chorus: Andreena Mills] + (DMX)
I gotta make it out and move quickly (grr)
Can't allow the past to restrict me (grr)
Bet this time around they won't skip me (grr)
I am the last hope (THE CHAMP!)
Won't hesitate not even for a second (grr)
The hustle has become an obsession (grr)
I'm on the frontlines with my weapon (grr)
I am the last hope

[DMX]
Ahhhhhhh-OOOOOOH!
Damn! I went through it again (uhh)
After tell everybody I wouldn't do it again
I kinda feel like I let my people down, yup~!
But to get them right, I gots to pick myself up (c'mon!)
When I heard this beat and hook, it was so raw (ughh)
Looked in the mirror, didn't like what I saw (ughh)
All I could say is "Aww man, shit gotta change (FOR REAL!)
Either get it right or take one to the brain" (BLAM!)
But y'all knew the pain that I went through daily (woo!)
Tryin to stay sane through the rain, y'all don't hear me
I'm slippin, fallin, I can't get up
But this time I'm outta control, I don't give a fuck! (YEAH!)
For the thugs, I'm the last hope of the team (C'MON!)
I'm the reason why some niggaz, got a hole in the dream (C'MON!)
These cats know what's good, I +AM+ the hood! (aight!)
I ain't hopin that they don't, I wish a nigga would! (C'MON!)

[Chorus]

[DMX]
I gots to do it for me (uh-huh) do it for them (yeah)
I ain't playin with this shit, I'ma do it to win (aight)
Know I can do it again (C'MON) cause I did it before
With little to no effort, and y'all niggaz know the score (for real)
First album dropped in May, the second in December
Both went platinum in one year like, y'all don't remember? (C'MON!)
Only nigga who's first five albums debuted at #1 (AIGHT!)
And wonder why I call you son (my son!)
I've just begun, to get started but the hardest part of it all (uh-huh)
Is to climb a slippery wall and, still don't fall
Break down and call up to God, when it get too hard
I KNOW YOU AIN'T GON' LET ME GO NOW! (PLEASE!) Brought me too far
Showed me I was a star (uh-huh) all my life
I know it all ain't right (C'MON) but before I call it a night
I'ma thank you for it all (uhh) the blessings and the curses (WHAT!)
And I hope you listenin (uhh) there's a lesson in the verses (C'MON!)
YEAH!!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
