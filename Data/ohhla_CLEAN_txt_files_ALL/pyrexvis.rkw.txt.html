[Intro: Raekwon]
Niggas got me the behind the pot again, but yo

[Raekwon]
The Pyrex is bubbling, the stove is broke
Fuck it, use the flame from the oven, the famous dozen
Bout to hit the streets, they buzzing, break it down, yo
Chop it like he raided your luggage
Major yellow shit in the pot, struggling
Trying to form a rock up, and double it, and call up my cousin
What up beloved? Stab it, tilt and twirl, spit in it
Plus put a little bit of milk in, fiends love it
Sat back, confident in comfort, the light blew out
All I see is all white stuff, suds in it
Four hundred razors in a bucket, seventy plates
We thinking ten mil a man, nigga, fuck it
It's on, get the baking soda, dump it
How many niggas'll pump to get eighty more? Get it jumping
Live by the code and we thumping
Nigga take this, fuck around and taste a flake bitch, you drunk it
It's all in the eyes of the hungry
It's all for the wise and the humbly, the rise came upon me</pre>
