[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, Rae, aiyo, Rae, check it out, yo
Let me go in there one more time and air these niggas out
For old times sake, you know how we do, my nig'
Old times sake, just for me, man, one more time, I'm begging you
Let me just go in, and just fly on these niggas heads, man
It's what I'm talking about

[Ghostface Killah]
It's like a body in a project hallway, who did it?
Who's the next nigga that sucked the snit-ich
That's my word, it could never be me
You see the deer head on the living room wall, like his neck fell off
That can be all sculptured and glazed with gloss
Call the shots that Bill Belichick would call
Snake niggas slither all in the glass house, racial slurs
When it's time to go to war, they cash out
Throw 'em in the rear-naked choke, they tap out
Niggas try to surround the kid, I backed out
And threw two rocks at 'em, watching the ho drop
I'm from a place where we locking the low glocks
Yellowtape, the bodies, jiggy and road blocks
Got the towels up in the air, it's so hot
Talking bout Staten Island, profiling
Switchblade city, the goons is wilding
Escape from my slums, nigga, you got talent
And we don't want the fifth of 'yac, we want the gallon

[Chorus 2X: Raekwon]
Yeah, keep holding the Hill, nigga
Everything's real, let's grow in the field, nigga
Big bread or making that lead pop
Too many ways to get hurt or get hit with a headshot

[Raekwon]
Aiyo, Yankee blue robins on, hand full of Winston's
Plump spiker with the ices on
Glad to eat too, Yves Saint Laurent's is see through
Blueish five seven, black rag, a street dude
Liquor crack kept 'em fiending, jumped off the roof two-times
I'm surprised he seen me, your bags is the truth, my G
Jumped in the white Turismo, this is fruit for me
And now the baseheads love my style, I'm like a new pipe
With airholes in it, they suggested now
You the new king, new don, new thing, only thing missing
Is the Qu'ran, a new arm, a new lean
Yeah, salute the prophet, trooper with a plot, kid
Every block, tear hood, lock it
Yeah, all my ride for me, this what I got from it
You holding steel, yup, pop for me

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
