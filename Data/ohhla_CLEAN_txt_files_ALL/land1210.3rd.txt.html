	"Who's car is that?"
"Hey rock that shit homey"
	"Yeah man that's Daddy's car, man Daddy Rich
	 You never watch him on TV?"

	"What's yo' name?" 
{Daddy Rich cuts up 'Daddy Rich'} "I'm back!"
	"What's yo' name?" 
"Back is the incredible" -&gt; Chuck D {'Daddy Rich'}

[Serch]	Let me kick to you a fable bout my DJ Daddy Rich
[Nice]	Born in Jamaica but had to make a switch
[Serch]	So he packed up his 12's and he headed 'cross the sea
[Nice]	Found a new rest on the road of Beverly
[Serch]	That's Brooklyn
[Nice]	Beatdowns, 40 dogs
[Serch]	And the Brooklyn-Queens

[MC Serch]
Cool Daddy Rich is on the 1210 mix
Scratch needs a itch like a needle does a stitch

[Pete Nice]
I switch up he flips up the wax with a mixer
Bookmakers step to the Father he's a fixer

[MC Serch]
Cool to the cut, shakin butts off the ledges
Came a longer way than Benson and Hedges

[Pete Nice]
The measures and levels of rhythm and scratch peaks
Speaks with fingers, the master of Technics

[MC Serch]
Solo diesel Daddy now stands in front of you
Displayin the ills that build on the one and two

{'Check out the Master'}	{'Daddy Rich'}
{'Check out the Master'}
{'Check out the Master'}	{'Daddy Rich'}
..
{'Check out the Master'}
{'Check out the Master'}	{'Daddy Rich'}
{'Check out the Master as he cuts these Jams' -&gt; Run-D.M.C.}

	{Daddy Rich continues to flex skills}

[Nice]	DJ D.R.
[Serch]	We are collectin
[Nice]	the papes
[Serch]	of the drapes
[Nice]	of the cuts he's selectin
[Serch]	Yo Pete you got a question?
[Nice]	Hmmmm, yeah I got one
	Can anyone ever serve the Rich?
[Serch]	Hmmmm, no not one
[Nice]	To spin off, spin the twelve inches
[Serch]	It's a brawl that'll call both teams off the benches
[Nice]	Wenches that backed up, beggin for the number
[Serch]	Those Brooklyn-Queens better get the Liquid Plumbr
[Nice]	Like lumberjacks, swingin an axe
[Serch]	Flexin the fader with the stomach in your back
[Nice]	Set tracks aside for the performer
[Serch]	Induce, and now I introduce the Rich former

	{Daddy Rich continues to flex skills}

[Nice]	True form be givin
[Serch]	Yo, drive is drivin
[Nice]	Got the jizz on your lip
[Serch]	Aiyyo, how you livin?!
[Nice]	All hailin the master on the outro
[Serch]	Can anyone serve the Richie Rich?
[3rd]	I DON'T THINK SO

{'That's my man throwin down'}
{'That's my man throwin down'}
{'That's my man throwin down'}
{'That's my man throwin down'}

[MC Serch]
Aiyyo, can anybody touch you DJ Richie Rich?
{'I don't think so' -&gt; LL Cool J}
Try to serve you?
{'I don't think so' -&gt; LL Cool J}
Try to duplicate you?
{'I don't think so' -&gt; LL Cool J}
