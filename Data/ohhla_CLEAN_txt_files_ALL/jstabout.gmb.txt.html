Song:   Just About Over
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Intro/Chorus: Cee-Lo and others (singing)

Heyy, so they tell me, it's just about over
Ohhh yeahhh-yeah, ohhhh yeahh-yeah
So they tell me, it's just about over
Ohhh yeahhh-yeah, ohhhhhh yeahh-yeah

Verse One: Cee-Lo (singing)

Well I'm lonely, and no one understands
The show has fallen, into the wrong hands
I am blinded, to see all that's passed
To know it was possible, to be a sadist
I have nothing, more to give
I have lost my, will to live
I lost my pride, lost my joy, and now I've lost my fear
I'd rather die, because I, am just that, unhappy here

Chorus

Verse Two: Gipp, Khujo

Man it's 20/20, uhh
It's gettin hard, to Main Street, the Boulevard
Earth warmin, causin the ozone to fall apart
Spark rebellion, I'ma go to, guillotine
the Palestines too, divide the land right, between you
Seas cross, dirt road walked
A lot of folks that don't talk
Some that thought they made it got caught
Slay the wicked, spirit'll soon fix it
It's gettin colder I wonder how much older 'fore it's all over

Not long, it was sad, how you killed my son
on the four-zero-five, changin, his flat tire
Suspect's a white male, lead, a possible robbery
Hurts my heart that we start off this year
like this, players in position to make differences
but be, charged with rape, with all that debit
while you had it, to take the ?gushy?
Twenties frozen this time
At this North/South planet clinic
where abortions are performed

Verse Three: T-Mo

From the start, I see the end
Will we be friends in the end
Took you with me, solo creeps
Never wakin lay next to me sleep
Hate to use you, don't abuse you
I won't lose you, fought to keep you
He dyin to meet you, confrontation
of the tainted thought, of me lettin you step to
I got caught, messin up again
I just can't win, tryin not to sin
When crackin the gin, makin fat distends
in a time we need to be sober
On my way through Georgia, headed back to Florida
with the Jimmy called Peanuts, mind
in the O, headed to a show
Gone with the strong, up out the do', now..
