I like to lay back relax and enjoy my turn
Til my eyes roll back and my toes curl
I love when do that girl
Til it come time for me to give her hers
Tell me what you want
Do want it missonary with your feet cramed to the head board
Do want it from the back with your face
in the pillow so you could yell as loud as you want to
Do you want it on the floor, do want it in the chair
do you want it over here, do want it over there
Do you want it in your pussy, do you want it in your ass
