Song:   Act Like a Cop Did It
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

And every time another kid shot down, face down, laid out, bleedin' out on the school grounds
And every time a little girl get sent, by a grown man pimp, selling everything waist down
And every time another wife gets snatched, car-jacked, get slapped, straight raped in the worst way
And every time a little boy's paralyzed with a bullet in the spine cause a thug had a bad day
We should act like a cop did it

Go crazy, mosh-pit it
Just roll, just rock with it
Life is life and death is death so baby why should it matter if I did it?
I'ma ride to the finish
All the grown men and women been tryin' to make the killin' stop
We need justice, and it don't matter the color, a trigger happy thug or a trigger happy cop
But let's act like a cop did it

YOU GET YOURS, YEAH, AND I'LL GET MINE
NO ONE HERE'S GONNA GET OUTTA LINE
WE ARE LIVING IN TROUBLED TIMES
WE'RE COMIN' UP, YEAH WE'RE GONNA SURVIVE

I have a reverence for life, I hate it when we lose it in the night
Ass whipped shootin' cause you losin' in a fight. 15, cruisin' in a buick feelin' right
Drunk and high 'til you lose it and you lose your whole life
And then we light a candle and we put you on a shirt
And then we bow our heads and we cry cause it hurts
And the preacher man tells us God had a plan so you had to go to heaven, only God understands
A lot of real people that was raised in the hood and they rep for the hood and they sweat for the hood
Wage war on killers messin' the hood and they protest the system stressin' the hood
Feelin' like I might be next in the hood face down with a bullet in my back on the track
Just make sure if I get clapped in the back it don't matter if the murderer is BLUE or he's BLACK

YOU GET YOURS, YEAH, AND I'LL GET MINE
NO ONE HERE'S GONNA GET OUTTA LINE
WE ARE LIVING IN TROUBLED TIMES
WE'RE COMIN' UP, YEAH WE'RE GONNA SURVIVE

Just lift every voice and scream
For the women and the children that live in pain
And the 18 and ups that vote for change and look down and see they're still shackled up in chains
I'ma start with home. Label it a no wrong zone get some other grown folks we can guard our own
Draw a line in the concrete, set the tone
Come up in here wrong and we snappin' bones
Little kids can't even walk across the street, without you ridin' by doin' 93
And you kickin' in the doors of these families, stealin' everything they worked for and leave with ease
It don't matter if you cops or you thugs or you dope fiend pimps on the block
LISTEN! God don't discriminate
He gone bring the sword anyway but I'ma act like a cop did it</pre>
