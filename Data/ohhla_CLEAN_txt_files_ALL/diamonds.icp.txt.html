(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Kill me! Whut! Motha Facku! Murder Murder! Whut! I can't fuckin wait to die!
Please muder my motha fuckin ass off! Bring it! Cause I'm goin to Shangri-Leezy!
 
(Violent J){Shaggy 2 Dope}
Have you ever tried {to get the fuck up out your hole but}
fall right back inside? {Once again denied}
Have you ever seen {people turn into the devil}
over money green? {Tell me what it means}
Have you ever been {to the wicked part of town and}
would you go again? {They don't want you in}
Would follow me {if i knew where it rains diamond?}
No more poverty {As clean as we can be}
 
(Chorus)
It rains diamonds nightly in my Shangri-La lit brightly
Who could miss this so inviting? Come stand mountain top and yell
 
(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Someone stab my face or somthin! Kill me!
What the fuck a ninja gotta do around here to get his dead on?!
 
(Violent J){Shaggy 2 Dope}[Anybody Killa]
Do you like to drink? {Would you fuck a girl the day you met her?}
What you think? {On the kitchen sink}
[Don't you fire it up? {Does this mean you wasted life now?}
[You're completely fucked] I would differ some
Hold your hatchet high {cause we're gonna need 'em when there's}
fire in the sky {Together we will die}
I can promise this {In my Shangri-La you'll have}
eternal happiness {diamonds in the mist}
 
(Chorus)
 
(Jumpsteady)
Diamonds drift upon the mist of forgetfulness, bringin a peace untold
as I fade away to become what my eyes see
seeing into the eternity of Shangri-La!
 
(Chorus)3x
 
Bitch Slappaz
 
(Violent J)
Six in the morning police at my door
Already gotta slap some more
Stuck my hand out through the mail shoot
Bitch slap sarge and his first recruit
 
(Blaze Ya Dead Homie)
I came out the ass, bitch slapped some
Grade school, high school, bitch slap wit guns
I remember gettin baptized by the reverend
Bitch slapped the bible outta his hand
 
(Shaggy 2 Dope)
The bitch slap master up in the place
I'll bitch slap ya train wrecked face
Don't assume friendliness with fame
I'll bitch slap the sound out ya name
 
(Violent J)
They'll call ya...cause you're not here
Bitch slapped out the Stratosphere
Mike P did the track, he bitch slapped
Pow formats straight the back
 
(Blaze)
Don't let me show up on TRL
I'm bitch slappin everybody to hell
I'm down wit the clown, Eastside til I'm gone
Yet everybody singin that Southwest Song
 
(Shaggy 2 Dope)
I bitch slap wigs off, everyday
I bitch slap old ladies outta my way
Southwest side, bitch slap capital
Every bitch made muhfuckin smackable
 
(Violent J)
For my bitch slap victims, I don't care
I'll bitch slap cowlicks into your hair
Faygo in a pillow case don't manage
I'll bitch slap ya head, brain damage
 
(Blaze)
I bitch slap cheeks red, hands off
I been known to slap her mothafuckin pants off
I bitch slap planes outta the sky
I bitch slap truth out of a lie
 
(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Call me Shaggy Spy McSlapmore
I bitch slap muhfuckas galore
Say we fake and wanna test the rap
Step your ass on up and get bitch slapped
 
(All)
What do you call a crew that be smackin like that? (Wicked)
Insane Clown smack your ass to the back
 
(Shaggy 2 Dope){Violent J)[Blaze]
Speakin of smackin it's makin me sick
{Everybody's talkin that smackin shit}
Sayin they smackin wit the ICP
[Just cause I am they wanna be like me
 
(All)
Talkin that shit you need to leave the place
Knowin you ain't ever even smacked a face
Claimin our shit, that's our shit you trashed
Mothafucka, we about to smack your ass</pre>
