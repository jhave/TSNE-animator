Yo who is it?
	Yo Lyte it's Epic, you got time to chill?
Nah umm, sorry I ain't got no time to chill
But I got umm..

Skins, skins, every now and then
I meet a Peter with a pecker that tries to be in
Because my tongue is the mind of a ReadyWriter
Like Chuck D said, I'm a rhyme fighter
No there is no other, because I'm smooth like butter
or should I say Parkay, butter - Parkay
Butter - Parkay, fuck it anyway
Yo, you get the rhythm (What the rhythm?) that I'm promotin
And if not, I say it in slow motion
L.... Y.... yeah.... T.... E....
Uhh!  ("There it is")</pre>
