[Intro]
I love you so much
I even went and got the live band
{*"Hold your head lil' bruh"*} HA HA~!
{*"You're not dead lil' bruh"*} Uh-uh, nah
{*"You are brown in this world that's black and white lil' bruh"*}
And you don't stop {*"I know how it sounds lil' bruh"*} ha!
{*"But you'll be alright lil' bruh"*} Uhh
Yeah, yo

[Jadakiss]
At times I know life can seem miserable
But lil' bruh you gotta lotta more living to do (live)
You gotta go get, cause they ain't gon' give it to you (nah)
Just watch what you say and watch who you deliver it to (watch)
Put somethin away, cause you'll never know when it rains
And you can never feel the love without knowin the pain (hey)
The bracelet and the pinky ring go with the chain (uh-huh)
These the different kind of jewels though that go in your brain (jewels)
Pray for your downfall, when you doin your thang
If somethin happen while you in charge, then you was to blame (you)
The less co-D's the better, stay fly get cheddar
Don't expect the V.I. off letter (uh-uh)
When you get 'em never let up, when you fall get up (get up)
Wipe the tears off, get the blood and the sweat up (SWEAT!)
If you don't say nuttin you can't be set up (nah)
Always stand tall make sure you hold your head up (hold your head)

[Chorus]
{*"Hold your head lil' bruh"*} And you don't stop
{*"You're not dead lil' bruh"*} Uh-uh... nah
{*"You are brown in this world that's black and white lil' bruh"*}
And you don't stop {*"I know how it sounds lil' bruh"*} ha HAH!!
{*"But you'll be alright lil' bruh"*} Uh-huh
Check me out

[Jadakiss]
Yeah, ain't nobody gon' front you (nobody)
There's money out here and you can get it if you want to (get it)
Or you can keep sittin around sayin what'chu gon' do (uh-huh)
If you don't pay attention it's gon' come back to haunt you
Yeah - make saving one of your habits
Never keep the razors and plates under the cabinets (never)
You can get further in life by using manners (uh-huh)
Not only are these cell phones tapped, they usin scanners
Never use your own address, use your nana's (nana)
And if you ever have to pull it out, use your hammer
Yeah - white paper or dutch it
Ha~! Automatically clutch it
Once you put it away, don't touch it (don't touch it)
Let it come to you, don't rush it (don't rush it)
Accumulate more than enough shit (yeah)
Then you get in the building and crush it

[Outro]
{*"Forget the latest lil' bruh"*} And you don't stop

{*"You were made to amaze and bring change lil' bruh"*}
{*"It takes one to no one bruh"*}
{*"So here's one to grown on bruh"*}</pre>
