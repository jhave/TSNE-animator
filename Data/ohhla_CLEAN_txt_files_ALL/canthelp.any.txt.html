What's with this self-inflicted pain?
(I can't help it!)
How come everytime I see you around you act strange?
(I can't help it!)
Why do you trip at the sight of a hater?
(I can't help it!)
And then slit they throat with a rusty ass razor?
(I can't help it!)

[Verse 1]
As I sit back and think about what to do next
I start to reminisce about my life and shit
Like how I came from the streets, was raised by the streets
That's why I give love and I'll die for the streets
I really can't help how I feel
And I can give two fucks to know how to deal
With the pain and anger, stress, emotions
I just roll a blunt, light it up and start smokin'
Sometimes I feel like I'm losin' it
And start blastin' at phones and shit
That's why I'm fully equipped
With the hollowtip, so bitches don't slip
I can't help all the things I do
(I can't help it!)
I gotta feelin' neither can you
(I can't help it!)

[Verse 2]
I can't help if I'm crazy, or just insane
I can't help if the words I speak cause pain
Ya gotta, keep ya cool and say (I CAN'T HELP IT!)
Rearrange, time will change (FUCK IT!!)
Deal with it, face ya'self
I can't help if my mind's taking ooover
Brace ya'self, there's no time left
My soul is gettin' cloooser
Stay away if you can't stand the heat
Cause when the mic's off, I'm corruptin' the streets
Brown paper bag wrapped around my drink
Eyes wide open, I can't help to blink
Why do you talk that way?
Say all those things you say?
Those rumors you create, I bet you can't help it

[Verse 3]
I said I couldn't help it, so leave me alone!
Why you askin'? Quit harrassin'!
Too paranoid to pick up the phone
Home alone all day dustin' off the chrome!
What am I supposed to do?
When everytime I turn around I got to deal with fools
It's like I gotta bend all the rules
To try to take what's mine even if I lose
Why you never make it to work on time?
(I can't help it!)
Why you smoke all the weed if you knew it was mine?
(I can't help it!)
Why you always start shit right before you leave?
(I can't help it!)
I guess fuckin' up comes naturally?
Naturally, naturally

It's ain't my fault that I was raised this way
Never meant to cause you pain
Only thing that I could say is
I apologize!!!</pre>
