[Copywrite]
Yo Copywrite MC 78 degrees
Mr. Eon, Alex the Worm King
Smut Peddlers

I search for bitch hitchhikers
Pick em up, put a wack tape in
And if they bob they head, I'll strip em naked and rape them
Out of ? sucks by how you start your verse
Forget it, then wait for six bars of the beat to pass before you set it
Prowess the hardest cowards that rock alike
Trying to sound like Pete Nelson but you can't even copy right/Copywrite
You won't have a chance to cyph' once I advance
Cuz I no longer rock the mic, nowadays I avalanche
I'm at the point where non-smokers get high
Before they challenge mine
So when they fuck up, they'll have an alibi
Illuminate the human eye, I'm fast with it
Let me see that new verse you wrote, I'll wipe my ass with it
I get applause and respect since you asked to get it
Too many floss to correct, drop rap and quit it
Pet pions of layman crews
This ain't rap
It's one step beyond what Kavorkian gets paid to do

[Chorus] 2x
We fight in the Tower of Babble
Three MC's and one bow and arrow
A hand full of gravel
How far we gotta travel, facin a road that's narrow
Bring you before the judge and kill you with the gavel

[Mr. Eon]
The procreator was conceived on top of a fader
When I die, I'll be the ghost that visits your sader
That rose up the bitter herbs and the unleavened
Here cat, here's your contract, lost your incentive
An '85 inventor, Air Max technology
L. Ron Hubbard couldn't see my Scientology
Heads know my name, no need to introduce it
Have you shook worse than a Columbine high school student
This is what I be, the anti-virgin machine
When I come out alive or the tests come clean?
Your girl gave me passage to her innebriated rectum
Sniff lines so Eon catch a deviated septum
When the herbal glow, I catch vertigo
Say you old school, don't even know 'Here we go'
The theory goes stranded on a island with amazons
This is Mighty Mi and I'm Eon

Chorus 2x

[Cage]
I smoke fair ? for designer clothing
Slut upon bags of pump out of a Cage verse
Roam in the field like a cheerleader
Flow like a landspeeder
Bludgened crews with mics then twist leak up
Watch Cage get a free fuck, Peddling Smut
Eat up in your old slut then spit out the guts
The talk of envious stuck
Noid droids among us
You thought you had some lights till you seen beams shoot from us
I give the in-out to certain kin out
That share the same blood as you
After blood, she pull my shim out....
Finish your verse
While I commence to school MC's like Colorado words
The Illest Four Letter Word
Observe how I serve
You pray for ? ? till I come out with silfurs
My pen retaliates through ways of my wit
If your rhyme ain't shit, then I'll bash you in your shit


Chorus 2x</pre>
