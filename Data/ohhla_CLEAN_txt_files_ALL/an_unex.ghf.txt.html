[Ghostface Killah]
It was an evil day, the sun glisten over the city
Shine bright, through the window, in the eyes of my kitty
I was reluctant, a ball in the pit of my gut
Like the phone call I got was just to set me up
She wouldn't do that, my love had love for the kid
So I slid on my wallos, and bounced out the crib
Pick the block about six up, shit got switched up
She pull long inside and said jump in the truck
So I did, we supposed to be gone for CD
She made the wrong turn, I'm like 'where you going to, sweetie?'
Felt the heat on the back of my neck, did a mirror check
I didn't know what to expect
I got knocked out and woke up in the melting pot
I heard the DeLuca's laughing and then shit got hot
They said 'Die, Toney Starks', you gon' melt like a record
Never to be remembered, never to be respected

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, I got word that my man got off
Rolling with Logan, I told him, damn, that broad
No surprise why she would do this
Word on the street, she had a side deal, working for the DeLuca's
Word is out, APB, his word is foul
Put a price on it, the hood searching her house
The DeLuca's won't stop without merking us out
We should catch him while he's celebrating, verse in the crowd
Toney's death, shit is working me vex
They saying Deck, chill, it's real and you certaintly next
Thrown into boiling vinyl, can't let it slide, fool
I guess it's just my time to die, too
First find Logan, gotta make her talk
Who's your boss, where's your boss, and who made the call?
Tell me or not, you sleeping with the fish
But first tell your boss that he will get his</pre>
