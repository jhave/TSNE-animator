Sugar

[Flo Rida]
Hey, I've got a mouth full of cavities
Sweet tooth, full of mama, like sugar to me
So my love with the lips, put a bug in the ear tone
Shawty gotta kiss, it's an emergency
Spit sprung for the taste, addicted to her gloss
Won't smile this way, baby I rub it off
Put my tongue in your face
A little mistletoe, sippin' Gran Marnier
I'm a fan all day
Do me that favor, cuz I like your flavor
My manage behavior; I'm into your major
Sweeter so flavor, that's good for this player
My hood, now and later, throw back like a pager
Pretty much, you're givin' me a sugar rush
Lil mama, give me high blood pressure when you blush
Lips feel soft as a feather when we touch
Shawty that's what's up

[Wynter]
My lips like sugar
My lips like sugar
This candy got you sprung
This candy got you sprung
So call me your sugar
So call me your sugar
You'll love you some
You'll love you some
I'm sweet like

[Flo Rida]
Hey, Sh-Shawty would you mind, cuz I want me some
Now and later, I don't wanna have to wait, you the one
Yep! Yep! Your vision. So, so delicious
Can't help my interest, candy addiction
Wanna peace, to a piece gotta get a piece
I don't know a piece, Give me all your sweets
Bottom and top lip, bout to have a sugar feast
Level with our trip, I'm a lip bitin' beast
Man for them things, all 42 teeth
Squeeze the sugar cane on your mouth, must beat
Ain't your mama slirp, stickin', usin' my tree
Like taffy but classy, get at me
I'm flyly Let you know I wanna kiss
But your lips, they'll do me fine
Now baby don't trip with the juicy kind
Get, get on the grip, you ain't lyin'

[Wynter]

So call me your sugar

You like my sugar, my sugar
