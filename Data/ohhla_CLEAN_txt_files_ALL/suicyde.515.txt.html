[Verse One]
Somebody help me, I'm thinkin' I can't cope
Early in the mornin, looked in the mirror and seen myself hangin' from a rope
And it got me in a fucked up state of mind
I'm havin' thoughts of blowin' my brains out from time to time
I often feel like I'm livin' on the run
And I'm straight nervous, paranoid, so I'm sleepin' with a gun
I close my eyes and I can hear them bitches screamin'
I'm wide awake and yet it feels like I am dreamin'
What should I do, I think I need a head Shrink
Every time a killin' is done, I write it down in blood not ink
I always wanna take my own life, put a bullet in my dome
Maybe that will make me feel right

[Chorus]
Instead of homicide I feel like suicide
Somebody help me
Instead of homicide I feel like commitin' suicide
Instead of homicide I feel like suicide
Somebody help me (Somebody help me)

[Verse Two]
I'm 'noid as fuck, I'm havin' nightmares 'cause of what I've done
I killed this fool for no muthafuckin' reason
Was there a motive behind it?
Not that I know of, all I can say is that that muthafucka reminded
Me of this trick I had big funk with
So I snuck up on that mark and let the muthafuckin' pump kick
Gauge blast, peeled his muthafuckin' cap back
And later on that night I'm askin' myself, why did I do that?
I should have knew that nigga wasn't him
With no remorse I smoke a blunt and kill a fifth of that Henn, then
Went to sleep, now I'm seein' this nigga in my dreams
Wish I was dead, one in the head
Somebody help me

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now I'm paranoid, body shiverin, got me wakin' up in a cold sweat
I grab my gun, put it to my dome, wonderin' if I should just die yet
These voices in my head keep tellin' me to pull it
And to my own muthafuckin' brain it's like I'm goin' insane
Feel like I'm looney, a nigga be gettin' psychotic thoughts
I'd rather be takin' a quick way out than gettin' caught by the law
Then spend the rest of my life ...(?) locked in a cell
My father say I'm sick in the head, ...(?)
So what the fuck am I to do to get up outta this shit
Put a hot one in the chamber, let the nina go click (bang!)

[Chorus] </pre>
