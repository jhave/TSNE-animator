(Commotion. Collision of billard balls)
Hey, gimme a blunt (Chiming of a toast)
Yeah, what's happenin'?
Hey, lemme get some Moet, baby
Yeah (Pouring of a drink)
All right, hey, I got the first one
Shit, grab some, nigga
You wanna handle this?
It's on, it's on
All right, I can get a shot a...

Come and parlay, parlay, hey, parlay, with a hustla

[Boogy Nikke]
Now lay me down to sleep on your satin sheets
Baby, be my pillow, wanna hold you tight in the shadow of the moonlight
Sip my water, I'll sip yours, too
Girl, ba-ba-ba-baby, whatever you want to do
I got the candle lights burnin' with the Marvin Gaye, hey

[Marvin Gaye]
What's goin' on?
What's goin' on?

[Mo! Hart]
Oh, for sure a brotha's down for the role playin'
Naw, baby, just bring yourself, I got it all planned
'Bout ready to get loose
I see my vibe got you gently caressin' them thighs
Wishes of excitement in your eyes
Lay you down, as I proceed to undress
Relax now, hun, you incapable and no need stress
From one room to the other, I got the right potion
So be prepared to cause a lot of commotion

[Tony Tone]
Come and lie with me and you will see
I got a pocket full of ends
So tell your friends we roll in Krayzie's Benz
Sittin' on them chrome rims
Plenty sticky-icky-sticky, Moet, yeah
That's right, and Alize
It's gonna be good night, so parlay, parlay, -lay,-lay

Come and parlay, parlay, hey, parlay, with a hustla

[Boogy Nikke]
I wanna hit it real smooth with ya, baby
Like a Garcia y Vega, take my time like table wine
When we bumpin' and grindin', look in my eyes
So you can see that it's real what you feel
No time to deal with them suckas because they bustas

[Tony Tone]
Barbecue shrimp on the grill, so how you feel?
Later let's leave the scene, 'cause that's just on the real
Baby, we got plans and dreams to fulfill
So let me take you to that other level
I mean that parlay level, baby
let me take to that parlay level, level, level

[Mo! Hart]
After a night of temptation, both our bodies covered in sweat
Go ahead and chill, 'cause we ain't 'bout far finished with this one
no more said, go on ahead, girl, take a nap
'cause when you wake up, I plan to carefully retrace my steps

Come and parlay, parlay, hey, parlay, with a hustla

[Wish]
If ya wanna ride, you can ride with us
If ya wanna ride, you can ride with us
Come parlay, come parlay, come parlay with a hustla
Poetic Hustla'z parlay

[Boogy Nikke]
Parlay, parlay, today
Baby, let's get the keys and shake the spot
Let's hit the yacht and get hot until our body rock
Baby, whatever you wanna do is alright with me
I hold real tight in my arms, and cuddling

[Tony Tone]
I will always say forever parlay
I know you glad we spent the night together
Baby, you and I, both know that we shouldn't leave each other
We got to make it all last (last)
So leave them suckas in the past
This Hustla came in - V.I.P. pass (pass, pass, pass, pass) 

[Mo! Hart]
Come and take this ride with me
I wanna put you in the state of supreme esctasy
Come along and take this ride with me
Ride, baby
Let's ride (Let's ride)
                                                
Come and parlay, parlay, hey, parlay, with a hustla

[Wish]
If ya wanna ride, you can ride with us
If ya wanna ride, you can ride with us
Come parlay, come parlay, come parlay with a hustla
Poetic Hustla'z parlay
You can't creep like we creep when we be parlayin'

Come and parlay, parlay, hey, parlay, with a hustla</pre>
