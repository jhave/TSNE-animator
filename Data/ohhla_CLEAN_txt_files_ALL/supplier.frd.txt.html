"They're supplying to the dope
 to the black and the Mexican communities..."

"Everything that I was taught that..
 only the strong survives; you know meaning well"

{*some woman interrupts*}

"Whether or not you would had to
 y'know scrape, bait, or whatever you had to do man
 The thing was to get it
 It really didn't matter what the means was
 or how you had to go and get it
 If it means that you had to, step on TEN people
 to get a dollar, then you'd step on ten people
 and you know this is what I heard constantly
 Only the strong survive"</pre>
