[Talib Kweli]
This right here go out to all the ladies
who cannot predict when the sun will shine
Just make sure when it do, you bask in it
You embrace it, you let it hit you in the face
Huh, you know what I'm talking bout
Yo, yo, ay, ay

The sun was in the sky
I was bumping "Sly Love", hard to find in the summertime
You can spend a lifetime tryna predict when the sun will shine
or simply bask in it like the flowers that come alive
Summer days always start extraordinary
Summer nights there's water in the air, wish it would storm already
I hit the corner store, I had a taste for strawberry quick
Seen the broad, very tall, very thick, licking her lips
Hips barely fit through the door
Imagine that, she bought a dutch and a lemonade out the Escalade
Bumping "Renegade" by Em and Jay
Symmetrical braids, incredible edible legs
Just to track her down, I went on a ghetto crusade
Serenade this angel like Cyrano de Bergerac
The lightness of her being was unbearable
So here I am at her apartment building, apart from feeling
"Heartless" like Kanye with a talk-box
I walked four blocks out my way cause her walk had me focussed
Her scent had me open, and since we had a moment
What I'ma say? Hey, I seen you in the store?
She went into a building and I had to guess the floor
Knocking on every door, that took bout a half an hour
till she answered "whoa", was still soaked from the shower
I seen some sour diesel broken up on my CD
She introduced me to her room mates, this Vanilla Dutch and this is Swisha Sweety
I got you open yet?
It ain't over yet, I love you when you're soaking wet
Been looking for you like the bounty hunter Boba Fett
I'm the one but you don't know it yet
The wettest skin, what a better beginning, she let me in
Let us begin, perfect weather for sinning, my Seraphin
We on the floor, barely made it through the door
New high score, she never came like that before, wow</pre>
