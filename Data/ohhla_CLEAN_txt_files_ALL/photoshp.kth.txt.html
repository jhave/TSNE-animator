[unknown poet speaking]
Tan photos depict smiling faces
Births, parties, holidays (HAPPY BIRTHDAY~!)
Children's birthday pics
People take pictures of the happy moments in their lives
Someone looking through our photo albums
would conclude that we had led a joyous leisurely existance
Free of tragedy
No one ever takes a photograph, of something they want to forget

According to the Oxford English Dictionary
The word snapshot, was first used in 1808
by an English sportsman by the name of Sir Andrew Hawke
He noted in his diary almost every bird he shot that day
was taken by snapshot, not a hurried shot
Taken with a deliberate aim, a snapshot then
was originally a hunting term</pre>
