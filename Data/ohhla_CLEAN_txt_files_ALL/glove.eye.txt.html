Song:   Glove

Run from the feeling
Lay the lonely down
Fill your hopes with someone else now
You could turn this city into a new town
As long as you find someone new to be around

Don't trust your choices
Run when you get sore
Eager for the next chapter
Still stuck in the one before
You could turn this city into a new town
As long as you find someone new to be around

Run from the feeling
Lay your empty down
Fill your hopes with something else now
You took his hand and crammed it into your glove
But just because it fits, doesn't mean that you're in love

Everything is old
Everyone's alone

Everything is old
Everyone's alone</pre>
