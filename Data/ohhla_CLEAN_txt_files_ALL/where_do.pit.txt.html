[Intro]
Let's.. (Mr. Worldwide).. takeover
MK, uhh
Jim Jonsin
Let's take over the globe
Hey-heyyy-yeah {*4X*}
Let the world know

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx] + (Pitbull)
Where do we go from here
World tell me please
Where do we go from here
I want the world to tell me please
Where do we go? (Where do we go, where do we go)
Where do we go? (Where do we go, where do we go)
Where do we go? (Where do we go, where do we go)
Where do we go? (Where do we go, where do we go .. from here)

[Pitbull]
How you gon' tell me the sky's the limit, when it's focused on the moon?
I don't need a TV show to +Dance With the Stars+ not me I'm good
Half of the world don't like me, half of the world wanna be me
But believe it or not that pretty lil' thang they call Earth, needs me
I'm here to show the world what it is to make somethin from nothin yeah fa'sho
I'm here to show the world what it is to do good business how I blew it I blow
I'm here to show the world that money don't buy happiness believe me I know
But just one thang; when I show the world - I just wanna know

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
As the sun rotates and Pit gets bigger
The mo' countries in the world I hit up
I'm a mondo bomb, double-oh, three-oh-five
a/k/a Mr. Worldwide, ha ha ha
Don't be silly - I've had it on lock and that's fa'sho
I already changed my city, now I'm on my way to change the globe
I'm tryin to inspire the world
To show 'em what it is when you hustle and you work hard
Show 'em what it is, to put your life on the lind for the love of the grind
Life is a rhyme with no reason, and that's the reason I rhyme
But once I show the globe
I just wanna know

[Jamie Foxx]
Where do we go from here
World tell me please
Where do we go from here
I want the world to tell me please

[Chorus]

[Outro 4X: Pitbull]
You must be blind
If you can't see the world is mine</pre>
