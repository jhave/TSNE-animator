Brooklyn got the funk
Uptown got the funk
East/West/Northside got the funk
L.A. got the funk
Boogie Down got the funk
Queens do got the funk
The bottom got the funk
We got the funk

(Butterfly)
I'm high as the wind so I blow minds
Curb hanger and hopper at the oracle of hipster
Just like Black Caesar my depths are fresh
'Cos you're a fish and I'm a water sign
My laid-back pimp walk is linear by design
Gold fronts soul I shotee now watch you shine
Me and C-Know makin' it a pundit
I'm glad to see my nigga he plush and lavish on the block

(Mecca the Ladybug)
Cleaner than others in my form I resort on the corners
Connect with my propers
Cop my double players
Cleo still hittin' 'till 38's pump and they up it
Yell it and could never by defunk-ed
I'm totemed in the fashionable flyers
Unscared against the palest of 'em
Gem percents unheard since I'm the storm
Donned '69 power...
Blocks

(C-Knowledge the Doodlebug)
You can check my stats I got crazy ups baby
C-Know got style don't play me like I'm lazy
Fadey but never will I go out
My cl-out is known across the crooklyn lands
My universal fans got stamina
Polar bears are fear when we step in the arena
360 C-Know simply cyclin'
Firm as a rock print the god when I'm buildin' blocks

(Monica)
Mecca she got the funk
She got the funk yeah
My man C-Knowledge got the funk
He got the funk yeah

(C-Knowledge the Doodlebug)
From the 11217 I transmit
My area is thick my vision focused
My jitterbugs limp n' learn as I squirm
But I'm a team player so I waits my turn
And when I get the rock I'm going straight to the hole
My average per game is pure black soul
In the 13-X styles the ignorance
Got the clearance to speak intelligence on the block

(Mecca the Ladybug)
Into illusion we drown
By forth sounds smooth enough to break you left
Another pound as my conscience get they rest
That's right we Shaft it
Includes this pro strips as I shit, burnin', blowin'
Shakin' E-as-Allah
3 different bags of proof 
Why won't you swallow it approach you one time, the clearest
Finer and sharper in the hour of black steel power...
Blocks

(Butterfly)
Son I'm divin'
I worm mork n'jeans high swarms
The nigga in the Cadillac so watch my spokes hoice
Spread him out a pound you slide me to 126
My soul-zodiac stroll with G licks
My understanding Bill doses 7 to the 6
I pump a fist
Even my hair got an ego
Gettin' super id
The kid is super kid
I doozey with the young Marx plus the 7ods on the B-Line

(Monica)
Butterfly got the funk
He got the funk yeah
Sulaiman got the funk
He got the funk yeah

(Sulaiman)
Ay yo here's the man
The true mastermind born n' planned
Talents skills not the wimps stand
So kill the sham as I speak techniques mad deep
To represent for the streets the city corners
Leave 'em hot as a sauna
Word is bond 'cause Sule the steps be on
The true original sunset to rise with foes and those you probably
recognized on the block

(Butterfly)
I play my jet tilted 'cause I got shtyle
Like every nigga on the corner stroll with brown boots
This is our block and we do be tripping
Ringin' round the ave like sata at mad volume
I flash a slick grin sayin' cool with nuance
The donut eater sweatin' at the blacks we all fronts
He asked my whats my name
I told him Mark Essex
Sucker I got lessons forever I'm 'bout to bless it
Ay yo Sule noise it up
Blocks

(Sulaiman)
I know you feel that you're real
Did you check to see? Nope check the crew members
Brothers like Ambush and C.0.
Filthy rich downs a man in savages
Shown how Skay-Yo swings a method to your madness
Real troops so walk around with the joint so get the point
Get get the point get the point get the point
And now lounge to the sounds 'cause the best spoke
I catch you on the next note
Or on the block
