[Intro: Boom] 
My city, incarcerated Wit Da Evilz 
No doubt 
Yo, yo, explosion.. Boom! 
Yo.. 
  
[Boom] 
Times and days, brothers is on their own, some nights blown 
Some of them method to blow chrome, a common home 
From the P-Now, when P-O keep a tab on your style 
Seein if your piss is foul 
And daily thoughts on theme of madness on the block 
Watchin to who you sell rocks, his mouth talk 
And glocks rocks your motherfuckin cradle 
As shit gets fatal and tombstones get labelled 
A nigga live for the ice or makin G's off the dice 
And too many pimps and hoes, this is '98 life 
And cribs is gettin infiltrated from Peru 
And cops is gettin bust and left in the blood pool 
The city sense be hard to tame, junkies on the block shootin heron 
And 'cane in their vain, who's to blame? 
My generation, my generation.. 
  
My city incarcerated Wit Da Evilz 
  
[Science] 
Now test the programmer, ridicule the slander 
Because I'm not vulgar, over and under dagger 
Laughed in the face of danger 
It was predicted now it's obselete 
Be conquestable by a small caliber heat 
Satisfy the street wars 
When anger's beyond the clouds and ocean floors 
I play through you if ain't lucky, so play your cards 
I play the law and nature with a rapture 
Hands above the collar bone so the snakes can't slither home 
Do you see the outcome? 
Beware where outcome cries deadly fury 
On head aches could leave you weightless like calestetics 
Cuz I'm a star, filmed in the mental picture 
Strikin the weak like a pitcher 
To come against me you gotta be drinkin courage by the pitcher 
I kill your lecture and especially the extra, extra 
Read all about it, how your soundin knocked you out your outfit 
Leave you naked with the Clark's rule over your mind 
Cuz you pledged allegiance to perfect attendance 
Pay attention and cooperation for a nation unlike you who don't like you 
But you choose to aim your fully-automatic static at my attic 
Why? 
  
Incarcerted Wit Da Evilz 
  
[Boom] 
Firestorm swarm and combine with the evil territory 
Terror tells a whole story, summer time flurries 
With a timed sun, heat up the climates to 101 degrees 
Braincells bleed from the mental damage 
Black Gods get on justice like Johnny Gamage 
A strong nation.. (Incarcerated Wit Da Evilz)
