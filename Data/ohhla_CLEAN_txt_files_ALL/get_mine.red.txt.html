Typed by: Lil Hustle

(*talking*)
Yeah, I'ma get mine (any form of weather)
You know, that I'ma get mine (all about my do')
You know, that I'ma get mine (this what it is)
You know, that I'ma get mine

[Hook - 2x]
Now get your's partna, I'ma get mine
It was a long time coming, no mistakes this time
And I know, you can't name one nigga like me
Loved by many, no respect for the police

[Yung Redd]
Naw this ain't pretend, I'm back at it again
Tell your friends to change, I got money to spend
Ay my grandaddy, grandaddy was a hustler
So this year, it's grand hustle
You mo'fuckers understand struggle, move on the block with the same shuffle
Like I ain't noticed, that them hoes had a thang for us
I got a watch for every country, every time zone
Even in the dark you see my stones, through a blindfold
Nigga please, ery'body work a d block
Or weed spot, 7-1-3 you think that we not
Even when somebody call the laws, or the streets hot
I'm just saying though, I'm back when they leave out
Texas raised, I was born for this
For the bread, hardships get torn for this
Listen as the plot thickens, get this glock I'm gripping
Leave red on your blue, like a Detroit Piston nigga

[Hook - 2x]

[Yung Redd]
These niggaz ain't real, let me make this clear
We them niggaz you fear, round here
These niggaz ain't real, that's the way that I feel
Check the price of my deal, check the size of my wheels

[Lil' Ron]
Any situation, paper making's a must
I get paid, cause I'm slanging that white stuff
You niggaz ain't like us, I could show you what I mean
Between the niggaz in your squad, you couldn't move a thing
My mind on money, ain't shit funny
You one of them lames, out would like to serve a dummy and think nothing of it
I give in no observation, because my occupation
Is to run the operation, with no cooperation
From a snake, or a snitch
I would advise you, to quit thinking for your bitch
Can't get no cash, if ya sitting on your ass
And you wondering why, niggaz always blow right past
Take a lot, of mind and muscle
No broke at stacks, that's why I grind and hustle
I'm focused on my stacks, me and Yung Redd we the next in line
I don't know what you doing, but partna I'm get mine

[Hook - 2x]

[Yung Redd]
Every song, that I sing
I still got a dollar for every stone in my chain, let me explain
Three hundred dollar shoes, no suits included
See them 22's sliding, no roof I lose it
Ay real talk, partna this ain't music
It ain't no secret, I'm the hardest in Houston
So far so good, so star so hood
Yeah them haters gon hate, but if they could they would good
Get mine, no rules apply
My wrist lit like the sky, on the 4th of July
I'm a menace to society, a boy in the hood
Chrome shoes, under every color toy in the hood nigga
