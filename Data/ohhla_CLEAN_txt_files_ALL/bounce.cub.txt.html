--Bounce it bounce it, shake it shake it
Wiggle wiggle, Make it jiggle, just a little--

[Ice Cube]
Baby baby can you bouce to this (bounce)
Fuck around and smoke an ounce to this (bounce)
Turn it up, we can clown to this
Throw your hands in the air if you down with this

(verse one)  {:20}
I hear you bragin 'bout the money you foldin'
Same nigga that be kissin' my colon
When you picture me rollin'
Nigga picture me holdin', pure heat like Nolan
They call me Poppa Doctor
See your bitch and i knock her
I collect them like Pokemon
&gt;From Nokishan, accept the ones with no behind
You can keep 'em, keep 'em from creepin' where i'm sleepin'
Same bitch and same club every weekend
Same drink, same dress, brainless
What would you do if i handed you a stainless
Can't fuck with a girl that's gameless
Would you tell the po-po's what my name is

Baby baby can you bouce to this (baby bounce)
Fuck around and smoke an ounce to this (smoke an ounce)
Turn it up, we can clown to this
Throw your hands in the air if you down with this (yeah yeah)

--Bounce it bounce it, shake it shake it
Wiggle wiggle, Make it jiggle, just a little-- {repeat}

(verse two)  {1:12}
Don't stop get it get it
I'm not the kind to get jiggy with it
I'm the kind to get niggy with it
I'm a show you what it's all about, trick!
Shake yo' ass till your curls fall out, bitch!
Don't pretend you can live without, dick!
Come with me ain't no doubt that i'm, rich!
Whatchoo goan do in the early 'morn
When the lights come on, and your drink is gone
Do you think you grown
Think we convone (?)
It's a party at my house i got drinks at home
Get to undressin', pull out the lethal weapon
Look you in the eye and i aks you one question

Baby baby can you bouce to this (bounce)
Fuck around and smoke an ounce to this (what choo smokin' on?)
Turn it up, we can clown to this
Throw your hands in the air if you down with this

--Bounce it bounce it, shake it shake it
Wiggle wiggle, Make it jiggle, just a little-- {repeat}

(Jay-Z sample)
---"Bounce, bitch, bounce wit me wit me...can ya"---{repeat}

(verse three)  {2:15}
Who that nigga that be in the club every week
Who that cheep mutherfucker won't buy you a drink
Who that bitch dressed like a freak but she won't speak
Who that hoe think she is, like her shit don't stink
Who that player on the floor, sweatin' in all silk
Who that girl showin' tits, like she got milk
Who that hater in the corner, always on tilt
Who that fool in the parking lot about to get killed (yeah)

Baby baby can you bouce to this (can you bounce)
Fuck around and smoke an ounce to this (blaze one)
Turn it up, we can clown to this
Throw your hands in the air if you down with this
(if you down with this)
Baby baby can you bouce to this (huh)
Fuck around and smoke an ounce to this (dogg best C.G.(?)
Turn it up, we can clown to this
Throw your hands in the air if you down with this

--Bounce it bounce it, shake it shake it
Wiggle wiggle, Make it jiggle, just a little-- {repeat}
