Well you can everyone I'm a down disgrace
Or drag my name all over the place
I don't care anymore, I don't care
You can tell everybody bout the state I'm in
And you won't catch me crying cos I just can't win
I don't care anymore, I don't care, I don't care anymore

I don't care what you say, I don't care what you say
I don't play the same games you play
Cos I've been talking to the people that you call your friends
And it seems to me there's means to an end
They don't care anymore, they don't care
And as for me I can sit here and bide my time
I've got my favorite music, I speak my mind
I don't care anymore, I will always be alright
I don't care no more, I don't care

I don't care what you say, I don't care what you say
We never played by the same rules anyway, yeah
I won't be there anymore, get out of my way
Let me by, let me by, I got better things to do with my time
I don't care anymore, I don't care, oh, I don't care anymore
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care anymore

Well I don't care now what you say
I don't care what you say
Cos everyday (everyday), I'm feeling fine with my self
I'm feeling fine with myself (I feel fine by myself)
And I don't care what you say (I don't care what you say)
I don't care what you say, hey
I'll do alright by myself (I'll be alright by myself, yeah)

I don't care (I don't care), Anymore (anymore)
I don't care (I don't care), Anymore (anymore)
I don't care (I don't care), Anymore (anymore)
I don't care, Anymore

Do you care (hell no), do you care (hell no)
Do you care (hell no), what what
Do you care (hell no), do you care (hell no)
Do you care (hell no), what what
Do you care (hell no), do you care (hell no)
Do you care (hell no), what what
Do you care (hell no), do you care (hell no)
Do you care (hell no), what what

Cos I remember all the times I tried so hard
And you laughed in my face cos you held all the cards
I don't care anymore, I don't care
And I really ain't bothered what you think of me
Cos all I want of you is just let me be
I don't care anymore
Did you hear I don't care anymore, did you hear

I don't care, I don't care, what you say, what you say
I never did believe you much anyway
We won't be there anymore, we won't be there
so get out of our way, get out of my way
Let us by, we've got better things to do with our time

We don't care anymore, we don't care anymore
We don't care anymore, we don't care anymore
We don't care, we don't care
We don't care anymore, we don't care</pre>
