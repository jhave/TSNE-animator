3 Horny Devils 

Three horny devils on the late night creep 
One, two, three horny devils 
Kottonmouth Kings rollin' through O.C. 
Bass first, then comes the treble 
Three horny devils on the late night creep 
One, two three horny devils 
And if ya feelin' (?) fool ya betta leave, ya beta leave fool 

I'm one of the three of the horniest devils 
I'm not Violent J but I'm a psychopathic rebel 
Just a bud smokin panty feelin' P-Town kid 
Got a 77 slant nose V-dub biatch 

Well this is for the bitchez and the bitch boyz too 
I'm Saint Dog from that Kottonmouth Krew 
Ya sister go inside to drink a 40 oz brew 
Gettin' laid in the back of a Subaru 
A Subaru, I thought you knew 
I did her doggy style like Scooby Doo 
Now listen up ladies check it out they call me Saint 
I try to be a good guy but the truth it is I ain't 
See I huffs on the paint (paint) 
Take rips on the dank (dank) 
And if I'm at a party I might hit the nitrous tank 
Fill it up, suck it in wa was to the head wa was to the head 
Fill it up, suck it in wa was to the head 
D-Loc's got the bud that make your eyes turn red 
Its a 9.4 on a Richter scale 
I got the green farm buds and they ain't for sale, 
The shit we smoke man would never fail us 
For the Kottonmouth Kings to inhale, biatch 

Three horny devils on the late night creep 
One, two, three horny devils 
Kottonmouth Kings rollin' through O.C. 
Bass first, then comes the treble 
Three horny devils on the late night creep 
One, two three horny devils 
And if ya feelin' (?) fool ya betta leave, ya betta leave fool 

I'm gettin' drunk smokin blunts like these white boys should 
They call me crazy crack straight peckerwood 
But I'm just a kid walkin' on this earth 
And yes I rock the microphone for what its worth 
And for what its worth we're all one in the same 
Got a little horny devil that controls my brain 
Hey hey hey got a bowl, get a light 
I beat in the mic some ask for the night 
Saint diggy-Dog takin' on oncomers 
Winter, spring, and summer I'm burnin' through the rubbers 
Burnin' through the rubbers and strippers man 
Bet I'll hit more skin than you can 
When your high goes flat Pakelika's got the best 
Fix you up fill you up with the fat green snacks 
Phillies always roll like a wrestlin match 
So light it up, go to sleep, Kottonmouth on the creep 
Horny devils always huntin always rollin' 3-Deep 
Three horny devils (three horny devils) 

Three horny devils on the late night creep 
One, two, three horny devils 
Kottonmouth Kings rollin' through O.C., three horny devils 
Three horny devils on the late night creep,three horny devils 

I'm D-Loco, I sip pot cocoa 
I wont fuck a girl if the bitch is a broke ho 
I'm Saint Doggy drinkin's my hobby, 
I'll split yo lip if yo ass gets foggy 
I'm X Daddy betcha I have these fine young fillies in my '62 Caddy 
Three horny devils psychotic rebels 
Rollin' 3-Deep bitch, so turn up yo treble 
I was born and bred to rip this (?) 
Takin' 7 bong loads to the mother fuckin head 
I'm a late night crawler, P-Town Baller, 
Creepin' up on ya like a creepy crawler 
haha 

One, two three horny devils 
Bass first, then comes the treble 
O.C. hittin new levels 

I'm D-Loc twelve hoochie strollin', phillie blunt rollin', 
My bug ain't stolen naw, kinda, not really just some of the parts 
Like the end of the rims the bumps and the box 
Man I touch a brew but I am hard to reach 1605 down in Huntington Beach 
Just to get lit and do another show ya hear bump, bump all night long 
I said bump, bump but that's another song and that's another track 
So bring it back to the facts of the subject 
Fuck it lets fish bowl this bucket 
Lets fish bowl this bucket, yea lets fish bowl this bucket </pre>
