[Time Bomb]
I'm from the S-O-U-T-H side of C-A, why they try to P-H
Still hit 'em up with that E-A, G-A to the N-G-S-T-A
So fuck them other N-I double-G A's
Hate the po-po's and kill the DA
Hang with my crew, blue strings in my shoes
Mary jane and some loot, while we swangs in the coupe
I'm addicted to mackin' hoes - tracks and flows
Crenshaw Boulevard back and forth
L.A.'s finest, and L.A.'s behind us
Gangstaz, hoochies, essays, and hunnies
D's still twistin', low-low's still hoppin'
Gangsta shit still droppin', Crenshaw still poppin'
Gang signs throwin' up, bodies still showin' up 
And oh yea - Time Bomb still blowin' up, beotch  (L.A.C.)

(When you got a L.A. Confidential, up in the place to be
 Ride, ride with me - )

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
Let's all roll, throw it up if you're with me
I'm so cold, who am I but stayin' G
Tha Dogg Pound spreads the word, I know y'all heard
Please take heed when I speak or you'll get served

[Slip Capone]
You know the gangstaz hang, gangstaz bang
And gangstaz slang, it's just a gangsta thang
Cause gangstaz dip and some gangstaz trip
I'm the gangsta Slip and this Gangsta Crip
I used to bump Brotha Lynch and Ganksta Nip
Cause wasn't nobody else up on that gangsta tip 
Gangstaz smoke sherm and gangstaz rock perms
Gangstaz don't listen and gangstaz don't learn
Gangstaz rock braids and gangsta jheri curls
Gangstaz gon' take over the world
Gangstaz go to jail but gangstaz skip bail
Gangstaz make mail, a gangsta won't ever fail
Gangstaz - gon' stay on top
Because a gangsta gon' make the gangsta shit pop
Just lounge homeboy, you in the gangsta zone
Hawthorne, California where the gangstaz roll

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
Let's all roll, throw it up if you're with me
I'm so cold, who am I but stayin' G
Tha Dogg Pound spreads the word, I know y'all heard
Please take heed when I speak or you'll get served

[Jayo Felony]
My nigga Slip is a gangsta
But cuhz, I'm a hoodsta or hood star
And I'm takin' the hood far
Little C-riders posted up with the bullet loco blue rags
Smokin' the bomb and fluid and keep dumpin' on you fags
I heard and seen it all, I'm hopin' I ball
Keep on lickin' them loco nuts until I get Crip balls
I'm still strivin', yea, you worried about what I'm drivin'?
Your bitch needs to give me more pedal to the floor
Fuck a Navigator, nigga I can flip ten gators in my living room
If you can't do that, nigga give me room
Had a ???? '89, but see your bitch made me mines
See them motherfuckin' rims on that brand new Benz? bitch they be mine
For mine I did the crime, had to run from one-time
And you bet I can't fit my dick all in your mouth at one time
I fuck your mammi in the butt and Crip Walk on your liver
While I'm rich rollin' on a river, bitch

[Knoc-Turn'al]
Caught up in a land of hard times, back off mine
Mash while pushin' a hard line
A hard cat, with hard raps and hard rhymes
I hardly pay attention to rats
But my mind says hard dick served to a bitch ain't no crime
Cook soft dope to hard dimes
Chicken - by the way I flip mine
I hard hit and grip like canines
I target hard heads with no spine
March in and start to take mine
Big D let me fuck that bitch and you fuck mine
Off hard liqour it's hard to unwind
Knoc-turn'al comes through in overtime
When I die build me a shrine
I'm as - hard as hard can get
In my mind I ain't begun to spit yet, and until that time - 

[Butch Cassidy]
Let's throw it up, throw it up , let 'em know
Out in the West, represent, let it go
Let's throw it up, throw it up , let 'em know
Out in the West, represent, let it go

(L-L-A.C.)
