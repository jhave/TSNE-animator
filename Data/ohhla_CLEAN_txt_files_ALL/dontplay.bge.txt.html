[C-Murder]
I mean mug fake niggas that be testin' my presence 
so duck and run, young nigga, 187 ya fellows 
Friend or foe, you'se hoe, so dry ya eyes I'm bustin'
I told these bitches I'm thuggin', them ghetto niggas they love me
C-P-3 to H-0-V I feel no pain for real 
I got the status of a motherfucker hard to kill
I walk a block and watch them fools just step to the side
It's open wide in my city cause these niggas be shootin'
like Vietnam, them niggas get the one time 
I put ya crack on a block, I ain't hard to find 
A million dollars is my dream 'til I'm dead and gone
Watch me relive my life through my songs, ya feeling me?

Chorus [Big Ed]

Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
(Bitch who you playing with?]  (Bitch who you playing with?]

[Kane]
Get the fuck on the floor don't you move an inch
Bitch flinch, I'll be on that ass quicker than Nick
I done spent to much time earning my respect
My rights and lefts leaving you missing teeth like them rednecks

[Abel]
Yeah you think it's funny while you crackin' jokes 
I'll be crackin' necks, if properly prevoked
Get chocked, playin' around niggas I don't know 
And why you talking stupid when we around some hoes?
Bitch stop playing I done told you before
I'ma wire ya jaw, and leave you suckas sippin' through a straw
Or I could run ya over with my 4 by 4
And back up, bitch don't act up no more 

Chorus [Big Ed]

Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
(Bitch who you playing with?]  (Bitch who you playing with?]

[Big Ed]
Nigga you play to goddamn much 
Nigga you'se gonna fuck around and get your ass touched
You lucky you'se my boy, my dogg at that
Cause if you wasn't you would of been got the gat
Had a hoe call my house, when I got home
Why you cuss a nigga out?, words out
My gun out, I don't know what you talking about
Remember that gat that got your ass strecthed out?
Woke up on the floor a bloody dick was in your mouth 
You flapped on the ground like I just caught a trout
Now you'se my childhood nigga, but I aint in the mood today
Man grow the fuck up, cause all you do is play

Chorus [Big Ed]

Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
Don't play with me brah (Bitch who you playing with?]
(Bitch who you playing with?]  (Bitch who you playing with?]
