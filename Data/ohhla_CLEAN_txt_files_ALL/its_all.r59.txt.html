[Chorus 2X: Royce Da 5'9"]
I fuck with niggaz that murder
They do the type of shit you ain't heard of
Divide a nigga clique with the burner
It's all about ahhhhhh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahhhhhh-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm like Socrates
So to assume is to make an ass out of you fast after you drop to me
Look at the word, that's a suit, that's what you would do
Choo-choo train handguns, do your crew
I squeeze while I'm lookin at you
Cause you made a mistake like my nigga Crooked I's tattoo
I'm the answer - you niggaz is candy
Ya heart pump blood yet smell like a Jolly Rancher
While I'm lampin in my mansion with my private dancer
My man's outside of your house, my hired campers
I ain't the hardest nigga in the world
All I know is if you love me and know me you know I

[Chorus]

[Grafh]
Yup, you know I fucks with them niggaz that murder
They trigger finger's itchy when they grippin them burners
I am not a 9-to-5'er, I don't sit with them workers
Nigga I was flippin work while you was flippin them burgers
But I used to work in offices, now I'm the president
I'm where the Oval Office is but I don't roll with officers
I roll with loaded cartidges, don't know what law enforcement is
I know, I was marvelous, the road is like an orphanage
I blow and explode because I'm the arsonist, unloadin where the target is
I throw, gang signs when I pose for photographers
You don't know what the motto is, it's death before dishonor
Black Hand President, I's elected before Obama
I'da ran

[Chorus]

[Outro: Royce]
Yeah (yeah)
Black Hand (Black Hand)
M.I.C. Records, Gracie Prod'
Y'all know what it is nigga
It's Mr. Porter, from here on out
Haha, NICKEL, "Street Hop"
SLAUGHTERHOUSE! {*echoes*}</pre>
