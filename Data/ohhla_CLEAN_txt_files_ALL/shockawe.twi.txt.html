[Anybody Killa]
Don't read it, time to shut 'em down, turn another page
Put 'em in the Blender magazine crusade
Kill 'em all, burn 'em all, take 'em to the streets
Another publicist dead, page one fifty-three
Only credit was a cover, tag next months issue
Read all about fallen bears dissin' you
Here's a story for that ass, Lotus ready to brawl
Bringin' you blood, shock and awe, bring it on

[Violent J]
You can't make or break me, fuck MTV
I'm a underground killer huntin' VIP
And murderous me following Tom home
With a twelve inch shank about to bloody the chrome
I cut his throat so deep, nearly cut off his head
Thirteen wounds found in the chest of his kids
And his wife, I still got his wife
She be suckin' our dicks at the Pod as we write

Shock, stab 'em up, and awe, watch 'em fall
And then back into the underworld we crawl so fuck y'all bitches
Shock, stab 'em up, and awe, watch 'em fall
And then back into the underworld we crawl so fuck y'all bitches

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I pull up strappin' bombs at your tailgate parties
Rush your gate with at least 45 of my homies
Dissin' out pile rings, knockin' out sound man
Jump in your mosh pit with my Hatchet in hand
OzzFest, Blood Fest, snow corner, more
Showin' all these faggots all about hardcore
Tiein' hands with mic cords and burnin' down your stage
All this shit in all Juggalo's names

[Monoxide]
As soon as I walk in the door I set it off
I slap Fred Durst and the guy who plays Ross
So temptin' to rush the stage
And choke the shit outta Chris Cornell for ruinin' Rage
Lights go out, mind doin' again
And when they come back on I got my dick in Lil' Kim
I pulled off the rubber and bitch slapped Danny Glover
Now I swing on Ashton Kutcher and I bet I get the cover

Shock, stab 'em up, and awe, watch 'em fall
And then back into the underworld we crawl so fuck y'all bitches
Shock, stab 'em up, and awe, watch 'em fall
And then back into the underworld we crawl so fuck y'all bitches

[Jamie Madrox]
Fuck the radio and all the songs they play
Their playlists are wack and their DJ's are gay
I ain't payin' you shit to play my song
Five g's for rotatino, you know that's wrong
Got to come with more money just to add my shit
Gotta pay an A &amp; R to straight suck your dick
Take you to lunch get you all drunk and shit
I'm like fuck nah, fuck you and the mainstream, bitch

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I bomb on all you block parties, what's that
Fuckin' radio friendly love songs, that shit is wack
All you candy coated rappers and red cap wearers
I got seven slugs and eleven pallbearers
The only block I know is a block for my gat
When I cock the hammer and pull the trigger back
Erasing all the top ten spots, cut out ya hearts
And mak you number one on the dead chart bitch

Shock, stab 'em up, and awe, watch 'em fall
And then back into the underworld we crawl so fuck y'all bitches
Shock, stab 'em up, and awe, watch 'em fall
And then back into the underworld we crawl so fuck y'all bitches</pre>
