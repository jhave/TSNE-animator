[Intro: Saigon]
Yeah
It's the greatest story, ever ever told
First time ever, knowmsayin?
I'ma let y'all muh'fuckers know somethin man
I'm shuttin shit down, it's a promise man
Dun-dun, let me get into this shit man
Make 'em remember who I be
{*scratched*: "It's time for America to hear THE TRUTH!"}

[Saigon]
Check, the attribute is God be
Lord Supreme Allah helper to another God in need, indeed
I feed off a lot of the bullshit that tends to succeed
I was waitin, Just went and took a minute to breathe
Even squeezed off a +Warning Shot+
Mooseknuckle to Brownsville, they impatiently waitin for your boy to drop
Lo and behold, "Greatest Story Never Told"
Chapter 1, Verse 1, the genesis of my scroll
is realer than 9/11, I rhyme about lyin reverends
while showin no total respect to the big guy in Heaven
I rap about politicians how money's their acquisition
To get it they gotta keep us without a pot to piss in
Struggin to survive, 9-to-5 ain't makin it
Turn on the TV all I see is celebs takin it
Feelin like they got all the bread but ain't breakin it
We're takin it, soon as I find a oven where they bakin it

[Chorus]
Whoa (the greatest story never told)
Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (tell 'em again God, what it is)
Whoa woo whoa (look, it's the greatest story never told)
Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (haha, yeah nigga)
Whoa woo whoa (it's the greatest story never told)
Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa woo...
{*scratched*: "It's time for America to hear THE TRUTH!"}

[Saigon]
Check it, check
We was brought here to pick the cotton
Now we pickin the music that massa listen to, the clothes in which he rockin
We don't drive a hard bargain
All we want back is crack, some more gats and some more of that bullshit rap
The crime rhyme is still black on black
And we need a leader like me to get us back on track
When y'all make them diss records do you know what you doin to black community?
Market and promote the fact that we lack unity
Them white people look at you and laugh
You look like a porch monkey boy dancin for cash
Wanna get on a record and talk trash
See him at the awards and don't do shit but walk past
And that, that's somethin we call CRASH
Coward Rappers Actin So Hard when they really just all ass
Abondoned Nation on the warpath
And then we gotta bring some heat out cause we changin the forecast

[Chorus]
Like whoa (greatest story never told)
Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (it's the greatest story ever never)
Whoa woo whoa (it's the greatest story never told)
Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (yeah)
Whoa woo whoa (it's the greatest story never told)
Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (uhh, uhh, uhh)
Whoa woo...
{*scratched*: "It's time for America to hear THE TRUTH!"}

[Saigon]
Look, once again in the beginnin I was sinnin
Now I'm in the ninth innin of the game of life, grinnin cause I'm winnin
I'll teach you how to rhyme, y'all only know how to riddle
Or peep the government wan' do me like Malcolm Little
They say that I'm a threat to the society
Since I put my thinkin cap on and stop lettin them fuckers lie to me
You gotta take it back to face the fact
These D's look at us as just another case of crack
If I bust a gun in the hood I get Attica or the cat
I bang a gat in Iraq I get a pat on the back
Best believe I know better than that
This a lesson for all my listeners, this shit ain't just regular rap
It's the greatest story that ever been spat
It's gon' teach the hood and at the same time make my pockets elephant fat
Go 'head with all the irrelevant rap
Me and my nigga Just Blaze bring the true element back

[Chorus]
It go whoa (it's the greatest story never told)
Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa woo whoa (it's the greatest story never told)
Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (yeah, y-yeah, y-yeah)
Whoa woo whoa (it's the greatest story never told)
Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (ohh, yeah)
Whoa woo (time, t-time for America, go 'head)
{*scratched*: "It's time for America to hear THE TRUTH!"}

[Outro - Just Blaze scratches]
"Time, time, t-t-time"
"T-time, time, t-t-time"
"T-time, time, t-t-time-time"
"Time, time, t-t-t-time"
"Time, time, time, time, time, time"
"Time for America to hear THE TRUTH!"</pre>
