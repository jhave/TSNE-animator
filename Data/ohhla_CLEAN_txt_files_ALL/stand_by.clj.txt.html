(LL Cool J) 
Yeah this one goes out to all the ladies in the house 

(LL Cool J) 
I need two to stand by me when the chips are down and 
Stick around while I defend my crown and 
No sell-out, the chip is too rough and 
I'll blow your skin to sofa, leave your mind to be tough 
And I might seem rough but life is much rougher 
To see success sometimes you gotta suffer 
I need a woman that's stronger than material needs 
And isn't motivated by green 
Dry my tear-drops and feelin' my pain and 
Watchin' my back while I strive to maintain and 
Makin' love like a medicine doctor 
I knew that she was bad from the day that I clocked her 

(Chorus: Dawn Greene) 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby 

(LL Cool J) 
My enemies come and my break-bread's tough but 
You recognize game from your eyes and walkin' 
Baby ain't no way I'll let the vultures attack you 
So I'll teach you the game and tell you how to react to 
The conversation, sexy vibration 
Visual stimulation, slick persuasion 
Times are hard, I need a woman that rolls by God 
And the only man she loves is Todd 
But will you be around when the raindrops fallin' 
Or could it be you never loved me at all and 
I need a trooper, a soldier, a agent 
I need someone who can roll with my arrangement 
The reap reducer factor and 
The Queen of the Universe, not an actor and 
Standin' by her man till the end 
Not only as a lover but a friend 

(Chorus: Dawn Greene) 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby (yeah) 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby 

(LL Cool J) 
Man, do things get better? 
We can look back at the whole aerators 
Remember the times when they said I couldn't do it 
But I was rougher than rough and baby you knew it and 
You held back when your loved jobs called in 
You had faith when they said they're not callin' 
You understood that what we had was good 
you stood by your man like a real queen should 
That's why now I got you livin' your dream as 
A beautiful wisdom, a part of my team and 
As long as I live on this earth 
Anything you want is what your loyalty's worth 

(Chorus: Dawn Greene) 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby 
(I wanna send this one out to all the ladies in the house) 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your man 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby, (word) 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your man (peace) 
You got to stand by your baby 
You got to stand by your man 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your man 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby 
You got to stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your man</pre>
