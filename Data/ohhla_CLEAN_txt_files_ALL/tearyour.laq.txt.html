Song:   Tear Your Soul Out
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch (with help from liner notes)

Tear it out!
I want to
tear it out!
(Tear your soul out)
(You gotta tear your soul out)
Tear it out!
(Tear your soul out)
Tear it out!
(Tear your soul out)
(You gotta tear your soul out)

And here we go, check it out

Tear it out!
Tear it out!
Tear it out!
Tear it out!

[ VERSE 1: Laquan ]
The truth is seldom said, lies are spread
Seek hope, your rope is thin as thread
You're not a treath, brother, you're just flesh
Tear a hole in your chest and use your heart to wipe the sweat
And when done use your lungs for extra-breath
Dig your grave and then you witness death
Earth is a battle ground, my wicked sound is hell-bound
Refuse to be held down
Endless poems I perform form a brainstorm
A wall can't stop, not even a mental block
You gotta give your best, let the good times roll our
You gotta tear your soul out

[ CHORUS ]
You should never hold out
I want to see you tear your soul out
Let the good times roll out
I want to free you, tear your soul out

[ VERSE 2: Laquan ]
Mind torture, mental gas chamber
You've been locked in a prison that lies within
It's up to you whether you escape or not
Checkin your soul to see how much soul you got
Caught in a crossfire, it's like I'm stuck in a barbed wire
And still manage to rise higher
Your synthetic method is non-poetic, pathetic
Smooth and your voice is too energetic
Mouth is swollen, I'm puttin my soul in
Giving you black on wax I can't hold in
You wanna grab the earth and rip a hole out
I gotta tear my soul out

[ CHORUS (2X) ]
You should never hold out
I want to see you tear your soul out
Let the good times roll out
I want to free you, tear your soul out

Tear it out!
Tear it out!

[ VERSE 3: Laquan ]
Taste the fate as the concrete crumbles
Now you're humble, your ego's tumbled
Make your advancement, now's the chance to get
One step beyond but seven behind Laquan
Break the chain that detains the brain
It held some back, but some are above that
Method is electrified, a fortified vitamin
If it doesn't hit then I'ma try again
Phrases penetrate the brain and disintegrate
Any interference that dwells in my clearance
Gather I rather not try and hold out
Lather up sweat and tear your soul out

[ CHORUS (2X) ]
You should never hold out
I want to see you tear your soul out
Let the good times roll out
I want to free you, tear your soul out

Tear it out!
Tear it out!
Tear it out!
Tear it out!
Tear it out!
Tear it out!
Tear it out!
Tear it out!
Tear it out!
Tear it out!
Tear it out!
Tear it out!</pre>
