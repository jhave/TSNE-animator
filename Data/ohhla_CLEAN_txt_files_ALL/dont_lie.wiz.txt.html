Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Haha - They say I smoke too much
I say you can't smoke enough in this bitch - hahaha
Uh - OG Kush in my eyelids, high as fuck I'm like wireless
Ain't playin the game, I'm not childish
Taylor Gang, we the wildest, Takin shots like I'm Irish
Goin to shop for that fly shit
If it's private I'm flying it, If I like it I'm buying it
If it's foreign I'm driving it, If it's potent, I'm smokin it
That '69 interior look sexy as hell when you open it
If that kush good, I might roll a bit, Wife happy, I'm strokin it
Cover of the source cuz my ownership, Hatin niggaz like holy shit
Club promoters like fly him out, Die-hard fans like pay the man
150k for a show, I rub my hands like Birdman
Rippin jeans and takin drags, Poppin tags and makin swag
On the internet erryday and you fuck niggaz still make us laugh
I ain't really wanna talk shit but the shit I bought just make us brag
Clothes small but my money long with my gold tooth and my nappy head
'For I see you thinkin that's a seat, Nigga like me treated like a bed
Wake me up when it's time to eat, Only Nigga In First Class

I say fuck you less I'm wit you
Though I prolly never diss you want to me roll and smoke with you don't lie
I say fuck them other niggaz man I'm down for all my niggaz cuz they down to ride
Lil nigga say word, Ya ain't never smoke no fire
Ya ain't never smoke no fire
Lil nigga say word, Ya ain't never smoke no fire
Ya ain't never smoke no fire
Lil nigga tell the truth, Ya ain't never smoke no fire
Ya ain't never smoke no fire
Lil nigga tell the truth, Ya ain't never smoke no fire
Nigga yous a goddamn liar</pre>
