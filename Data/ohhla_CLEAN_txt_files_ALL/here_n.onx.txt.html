[Onyx]
Knock 'em out y'all, knock 'em out y'all
Knock 'em out and tell them what we all about y'all
Knock 'em out y'all, knock 'em out y'all
Knock 'em out and tell them what we all about y'all
Knock 'em out y'all, knock 'em out y'all
Knock 'em out and tell them what we all about!

[Sonee Seeza]
Here and now I got what you want, so come and get a sip
So I can re-script the lyrics; makin MC's - feel it!
The devious, devastating theorist
And I can mess you up, somethin ludicrous
Ain't nuttin you can do to this
Stop the huffin and puffin, stompin niggaz out
I'm makin 'em stiff and, fillin 'em with ?? stuffin
Bloody, bloody, bloody, blood clot, ?? on your knot
Left kids in the stack with the big hot, sixteen shot
Duke listen, kids is missin, in action
If that's not ?? picture, elimate suckers with SUB-TRACTION
Cause I get the chills on a mid summer night
Yeah I can fight, or in the winter I make your ass hot like a light
Bub-rub-a-dub, three bodies in a tub
OK, go get the men, with the white gloves
You can call it business but I'm.. personal
Onyx's verse to whoever, want to feel with terror
And to all y'all crews, WHATEVER (WHATEVER)
Cause the place is here, and the time is now

Chorus: Sonee Seeza

The place is where (here) the time is when (now)
The place is where (here) the time is when (now)
The place is where (here) the time is when (now)
The place is where (here) ..

[Fredro Starr]
At night time I kill 'em, bloody on my canine
Search and find you just, mob through blast fast
Ruffin 'em up, toughen 'em up, as ass
IT ISN'T?  WHAT WAS THE DAMN MURDER
that I'se done gone sick
I TRIED the drastic tactic, of +Bacdafucup+
The ass kick, blast with, my shook nine rhymes
Crimes is crazy, easy baby
Mess around, get drowned and have that ass in Paisley
(Props is props) Unorthodox, so watch!
Where we live, we get beat up, BY THE COPS
But that can't stop, the kids are so HIP-HOP
Roof to roof top - dropped; the eight count
DEAD!  Dead on arrival, forget the fame
The game is survival, you know my name (uh-huh)
I throw blows in the world of the rap war
Tap jaws of crews, bruise 'em on tour

Chorus:Fredro Starr

And the place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)

[Sticky Fingaz]
I've come to suck the blood upon a microphone
Gaze deep into my eyes, I'll make you turn to stone
It be, "Night of the Walking Dead" if you don't leave me the hell alone
Cause rap ain't no game but I'm playin for keeps
I live in the Rotten Apple, the city that never sleeps
STOP! You try to steal my style and got spotted
Niggaz can't get it, cause niggaz ain't got it
I've been a bald head since the, age of ten
Plus I'm a ruthless crook and, I was born in Crooklyn
So a stick up, is a piece of cake for
the kid with the Sticky Fingaz everything I touch I take
So don't make me angry; you won't like me when I'm angry
All that frustration starts to change me
Then I SCREAM! So my voice gets horse
It's time to face the music, and the Red Cross
You can fool some of the people some of the time
The beat is the heart and the words get the mind
I'm livin proof there's no hope of mankind

Chorus: Sticky Fingaz

The place is where (here), and now is the time
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)
The place is where (here), the time is when (now)

[Sticky] And now I wanna battle!
[Sonsee] Word up
And this ain't melody, melody
So don't sing it, bring it!!
[Sticky] Let's throw down

[Fredro Starr]
Aiyyo
We need a little motherfuckin bit of crowd participation
(Bust dat motherfuckin ass!) KnowwhatI'msayin?
When I say bust dat ass, you say bust dat ass
Here we go..</pre>
