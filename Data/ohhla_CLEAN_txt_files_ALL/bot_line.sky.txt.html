[Intro - Skyzoo - talking] (Sample)
(Got to change)
(I know, I know, I know, I know, I know it)
Yeah, I know it to
(Yeah, it's got to change)
It do got to change, don't it?
(Ew baby), ha, let me do it for them
(Yeah, it's got to change)
Yo, woo!

[Verse 1 - Skyzoo]
I'm twenty-five but a vet in the game
And yeah I'm, super fly but from the 'jects all the same
And yeah I'm, true to mine so when the rest of 'em hate
I feel I'm, doin fine or they'd have less they could say
I mean, I dos me, embody what cool be
You hollerin who's me? I'm product on loose leafs
I body the loose leaf, you gotta excuse me
I jumped out of that hooptie and inside of that new lean
American dreamin, I'm part of that other suite
Any means necessary, the bottom'll cover me
I got 'em in love with me, knowin that tomorrow isn't promised
I'm a get it and then get me some more after I got it
Yeah I'm with it, I made it from the curb
But kept the pen the same 'cause they relate to all the words
So now that I'm the first up to bat and I can read what they be throwin
Tryin to curve it is a wrap, you can see just where it's goin

[Chorus - Skyzoo] - 2X - w/ ad libs
The bottom line is, line is
Gettin it is nothin when you grindin, grindin
Gettin it is nothin when you grindin, grindin
Picture perfect with it when I'm grindin, grindin
That's the bottom line

[Verse 2 - Skyzoo]
Uh, another day, another dollar
Get enough of 'em and ain't no way they ain't gonna follow
So you follow my lead like the two of the three type
The one's that is on the fence is on the bench 'cause he don't breathe right
Too out of your league, right?
Cool, I understand, I'm varsity pushin it
Move like I'm runnin scams and dogs from the looks of it
You be on your stand still, I be on my know doughs
And when you got your hands peeled, I be on my dolo
And I'm celebratin for those that ain't get to make it
I guess I'm makin it for 'em
And everyone who was waitin, I'm throwin greatness upon 'em
Everyone who was hatin, I so embraced your performance
That I'm callin for an encore, encore
Level wise, I'm somethin like level nine
And it's a different air up here, I get a better high
Definition of one of one and when it come to one
I be that, so findin that is a one and done

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Skyzoo]
Uh, picture perfect with it, right? Snap shot ability
Show you how to grind, got a back block agility
Money on my mind, yeah I'm back where the scrilla be
And as far as my shine, well my back's where the ceiling be
Closer to the sky, so with that you could riddle me
I'm literally the only one as ill as me, you feeling me?
Backpackers wanna confuse it
'Cause dudes is icy, that don't got nothin to do with the music

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Outro - Skyzoo - talking]
Uh, the bottom line is, line is
Yeah, the bottom line is, line is
S-K-Y-Z-O-O
Yeah, Eric G got beats
Uh, woo!
(Eww, yeah)</pre>
