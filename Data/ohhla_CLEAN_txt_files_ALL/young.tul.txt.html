Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Forgive me for what I have done
Cause I'm young
Yeah I'm young

Forgive me for what I have done
Cause I'm young
Yeah I'm young

I don't mean to frighten you off
It's just fun
It's just fun

I don't mean to frighten you off
It's just fun
It's just fun

We live on the edge of life
We don't even compromise
We rush because we're out of time

Forgive us for what we have done
Cause we're young
We're young
We're young
I said forgive us for what we have done
Cause we're young
We're young
We're young

I make mistakes that I learn from
Cause I'm young
Yeah I'm young

I'm sorry I'm not even done
Cause I'm young
Yeah I'm young

Don't worry 'bout what I'll become
It's just fun
It's just fun

I scream at the top of my lungs
It's just fun
It's just fun

We live on the edge of life
We don't even compromise
We rush because we're out of time

Forgive us for what we have done
'Cause we're young
We're young
We're young
I said forgive us for what we have done
Cause we're young
We're young
We're young

Forgive us for what we have done
Cause we're young
We're young
We're young
I said forgive us for what we have done
Cause we're young
We're young
We're young</pre>
