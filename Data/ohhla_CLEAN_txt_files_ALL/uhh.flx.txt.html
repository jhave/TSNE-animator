(The Bad Seed)
Uh
Let's go
Here we go, uh
Here we go y'all
Here we go y'all
Once again, yeah
Who better nigga
Let's go

Nope, I never got locked up
Never got shot up
But fuck around though
Beat your whole damn block up
Find your bitch knocked up
Cee keep it cocked up
I'm sick call the doctor
Beat the shit out ya
Beef I don't sweat that
Niggaz wanna dead that
They come home, find a bullet in they girl head rack
UHHNNH
How you love that
What happened to dem thug cats
With all the gats niggaz gettin in club at
Now I done fucked up
I done caught y'all frontin
Get your jaw tapped up
Get your chin bone buzzin
You can't squad me
Now your all alone cousin
The kids got no pops, wife no husband
God damn shame though
It's not a game though
Why y'all act like you don't know my fuckin name though
It's BAD SEED
Style off the chain yo
Only close my eyes when I'm gettin brains yo
It's like UHHNNH
Thought it was a game huh
Didn't know the name huh
UHHNNH
It's like (it's like)
UHHNNH
Still for the kids though
Niggaz let your clips off
UHHNNH
It's like
UHHNNH
Bitches take your thong off
Shake yo stank ass baby girl it's a song off
It's like (it's like)
UHHNNH
Meet me at the ballcourt
Blow shorty back out till she had to crawl out (crawl out)</pre>
