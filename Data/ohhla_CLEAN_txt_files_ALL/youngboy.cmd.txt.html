[New-9 talking]
The system got niggas missin', they ain't never comin' home
I can't live like this I gotta get from back here
I can't get a good lawyer I can't eat right, it's R.I.P. either way
Rest In Peace or Rest In Prison

[C-Murder]
I woked up an strapped on my shoes
I'm in a three man cell wit my homeboys Skinew &amp; Boo
C-Murder is tha name dat they gave me
An 187 what I'm facin' you can't save me
An uh nigga I really don't give a fuck
No hesitation, if you trip dawg you gettin' stuck
Already did three years in tha county, dats how they found
I had my 3rd Ward niggas round me
Tha Callio nigga what they hittin' for
At Rose Tavern, they caught me at tha liquor store
My baby boo she couldn't hide tha dope quicker
I'm on tha news now, down goes another nigga
An murder weapon in my draws I had to pause
They took me down town, nigga where's my phone call
I'm facin' life for tryna get my swerve on
A young nigga I'll never see tha 3rd homes

[Chorus: Ms. Peaches + C-Murder]
It's kinda hard comin' up in this wicked world as a ghetto boy
(a lil', lil', just a lil' ghetto boy)As a ghetto boy
Ghetto boy comin' up in these ghetto streets
(a lil', lil', just a lil' ghetto boy)In these ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up &amp; find yaself in penitentairy
(a lil', lil', just a lil' ghetto boy)penitentiary

[C-Murder]
Now I'm hittin' them clubs, 23 years old
An still on parole, wit a mouth fulla golds
I might whoop some ass tonight
These lil' young ass niggas they better get they mind right
Lil' daddy move I'm bigger than you
I got these brass knuckles but damn dat fool had a twenty two
I use to be a young thug way back
I tried to brake but too late he bust six caps
Wit beaucoup blood on my hand, I couldn't understand
How this young thug could shoot me man
I useta be tha same way back in tha days, but shit changed
Don't fuck wit tha lil' man

[Chorus]
It's kinda hard comin' up in this wicked world as a ghetto boy
(a lil', lil', just a lil' ghetto boy)
Ghetto boy comin' up in these ghetto streets
(a lil', lil', just a lil' ghetto boy)
What you gonna do when you grow up &amp; find yaself in penitentairy
(a lil', lil', just a lil' ghetto boy)
(Justa lil' ghetto by)
(Justa lil' ghetto boy)
(Justa lil' ghetto boy)</pre>
