(Chorus: Joya) 
Ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love 
Ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love in this game 
No, no, ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love 
Ain't no love in this game

I used to hustle street corners back in 1986 
Slangin Yayo by the dub, me and E-Bay in the mix 
only sixteen, slangin rocks on a sub, two 'o' clock in the mornin 
we watchin under, see the coppers kept their creep on 
But we was ready, didn't slip or slide or sleep on 
the game was dare, you could be here today and gone tomorrow 
partner, see you gotta try to survive, the system failure, house of people 
Money is the root to evil that we possess inside our arson minds 
that's why so many of my homies dyin 
Crack floods communities will we flex the green harsh look 
In the face of what we call reality, dead partners and clips 
pictures and bullet shells on grave sites 
Got me thinkin about my crazed life 
What would I be, when I think that it's a shame 
cause my trigger gots no heart homie and ain't no love in this game 

(Chorus: Joya) 
Ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love 
Ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love in this game 
No, no, ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love 
Ain't no love in this game

I watched the po-po roll on and chase my partner 
see, my homie's get stood on fool, by the coppers 
see the, Herion addicts and fiends walkin the city streets 
Not even wantin to care about what their children eat 
But see there's Doggy-Doggs, be a hog 
young player maintain to keep ya brain, like it ain't fool 
Gotta do what ya gotta do, roll with a crew if you got to 
But keep your game true, cause see them haters out there bad 
talkin about they wanna jack a young player for all his cash 
Better watch your back in '95 on the real 
Them youngsters out there drugged on that high package steel 
And can't nobody tell them nuthin about their life 
cause their daddy beat their mama and their mama on the pipe 
When will the sticky situation change, like I told you before homie 
There ain't no love in this game 

(Chorus: Joya) 
Ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love 
Ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love in this game 
No, no, ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love 
Ain't no love in this game

My homie mama almost died and had a stroke 
when we told her that her little baby boy was left in smoke 
We all shed in tears cause they did him cold 
I know if he was here, we would all be smokin like a Roach stall 
Light up the blunt and crack the top off of the Yat 
But all the Chronic in the world can't bring my homie back 
I'm missin all the times that we got drunk and fell out on the floor 
Both at the back of a squad car straight cappin on the po-po 
And that's a cryin shame, damn, there ain't no love in this game (*echoes*) 

(Chrous w/ variations: Joya) 
Ain't no love, I'm tellin you ain't no love 
I'm tellin you ain't no love in this game 
No, no, it ain't no happy phase 
You know that's right to say the place 
Ain't no love in this game 
It ain't no happy thing 
You know there's pointin it to blame 
Ain't no love in this game 
It ain't no happy phase 
You know that's right seed ain't the blame 
Ain't no love in this game 
It ain't no happy phase 
You know that seed no ain't the blame 
Ain't no love in this game, no... </pre>
