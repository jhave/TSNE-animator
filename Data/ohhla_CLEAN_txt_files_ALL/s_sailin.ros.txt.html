[Verse 1: Roscoe]
Now I'm so high and I'm so fly
My kids on deck my beard ain't growed yet
I'm so on point I'm so on one
This is how we do it here in Philaphornia
'Sco mack toe back
The one y'all love to blow back
I got five fingers it ain't no riddle
Why the only one showin is the one in the middle
Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the dog
Going at it over kibble out in the back yard
I drink Yak hard y'all act hard
Now I gotta cut ya up like a MAC card
Everybody packin a strap to spark
But don't everybody want to scrap this ball
I'm old school wit it, no tool wit it
Head up till we fed up that's hard
Smooth sailin'
 
[Chorus: Roscoe]
Ba da pa pa pa pa pa
Ba da pa pa pa
I got the ladies sayin
Ba da pa pa paaaa
Hell I even got my momma singing
Badia-She sayin 
Badia- yeah
badia-ia-ia-ia-ia
Big Sco singin- Ba da pa pa paaaa
My big bro singing
 
[Verse 2: Roscoe]
You know you got me movin
I know you feel my music
I show my G influence 
All I do is spit fluid
I'm rollin dippin smashin
I am throwin Young Assassin
I am growin up real fast and
All I know is flow and rappin
They call me young Roscoe the Philly Fanatic
Silly sporadic dippin in traffic grippin the matic
Sharp as a guillotine still a teen
The California sun just beamin as I lean
Pull out my cigarettes fiendin for nicotine
Straight off the Philly scene made for the silver screen
In a beamer foot on the gasoline
Tell me I ain't the flyest MC You seen
And its all Smooth sailin'
 
[Chorus: Roscoe]
Ba da pa pa pa pa pa
Ba da pa pa pa
I got the homies singin
Ba da pa pa paaaa
Hell I even got my papa singin
Badia-He sayin
Badia- yeah
badia-ia-ia-ia-ia
I got the world singin- Ba da pa pa paaaa
I got ya girl singin
 
[Verse 3: Roscoe]
Y-A high blazed step to us you get five fades
I got four homies ain't none of 'em simple
Sco-dizzle known to make the microphone sizzle
So many women after the mack
I'ma just pick one (sup) and smash in my mama 'lac
Accurate immaculate bachelor cake smasher
Def Jeff let me borrow the keys the break masters
Young and I'm buck wild labeled as a love-child
Runnin 'em up wild laying hella cuts down
I get the club shut down with this thug style
I puff clouds and touch crowds, what now?
Sick rhymes strychnine runnin through my bloodline
Pedal to the metal with one time behind me
My heads spinnin like a windmill
Rollin down the 101 countin dead bugs on my windshield
Smooth sailin'
 
[Chorus: Roscoe]
Ba da pa pa pa pa pa
Ba da pa pa pa
I got the people singin
Ba da pa pa paaaa
Hell I even got my sister singin
Badia-She singin
Badia- yeah
badia-ia-ia-ia-ia
Big 'Sco singin- Ba da pa pa paaaa
My big bro singin
 
Ba da pa pa pa pa pa
Ba da pa pa pa
Ba da pa pa paaaa
Badia badia badia-ia-ia-ia-ia
Bad a pa pa paaaaa
 
Ba da pa pa pa pa pa
Ba da pa pa pa
Ba da pa pa paaaa
Badia badia badia-ia-ia-ia-ia
Bad a pa pa paaaaa</pre>
