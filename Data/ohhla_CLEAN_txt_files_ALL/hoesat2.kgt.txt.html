"Warning.."

[King Tee w/ a voice modulator]
Ahhhhhhh..
Where da hoes at?  Where da hoes at?
Where da hoes at?  Where da hoes at?
Where da hoes at?  Where da hoes at?
Where da hoes at?  Where da hoes at?

Please can I go, huh, please can I go?
I don't wanna kick it in your pocket no mo'
I need some pussy bad, I need some pussy bad
And I don't give a fuck if the bitch is on the pad
Mr. Applebaum, you gotta put me on
to fuck Anita, pump up the bass and not the tweeter
Huh, I really need her, huh, I really need her
Or if you know another bitch then I would like to meet her
Huh

Where's the hoes at?  Where's the hoes at?
Where's the hoes at?  Where's the hoes at?
Where's the hoes at?  Where's the hoes at?
Where diggy diggy diggy where's the hoes at?</pre>
