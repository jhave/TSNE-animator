Song:   Castle Made of Sand
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Let's take it to the top now
To the top now baby
I'm a take my time
Through rain sleet snow
I'm a keep getting dough
You can find me on my ground
So put your muthafuckin hands in the sky
And if your sittin down please stand
Cause I'm on the rise and I reside
On this castle made of sand
Let me getta hand clap
I'm a make an entrance
Giving ya'll the lecture
Then I'm taking questions
My soul is sour making sentence make a weapon
Swimming in the deep end
You bitches taking lessons
Then I hear u hating on the boy
Well I ain't affended
Cause I'm the captain of the team and u play the benches
From breaking it down to rolling it up
Put an a d in the blunt
And I'm smoking it up
But ta kos but I stay with a few
But they replace like the lace in my shoe
So tell me what to do</pre>
