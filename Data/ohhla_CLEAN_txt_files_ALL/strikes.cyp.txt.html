[Sen-Dog]
Ain't taking, nobody back with me
It's on till the end with anybody who want to hit me
Ain't looking back, putting it all on the line
Don't give a fuck, bring the rough one time
And I think we should all get down and busy
Say the four word and you spin until your dizzy
Niggas say who is he, but I'm the ? fact
Same fool that's watching, is the one who stabs your back
So, make a plot, but yo, it's non-stop
Knowing exactly who comes on the block
Take no prisoners, put that in effect
Get the name from your set, and tat it on your neck
Let these know motherfuckers know who got next
Southside represent, I be catching wreck
And show your respect, when you step up to me son
Don't imitate, cuz my style ain't in season
Go back to the lab, upgrade the chump
Get a new ? gun before you get dum dum

[B-Real &amp; Sen-Dog]
Meltdown, taking you home, the unknown
Countdown, hitting the ground, the seeds grown
Downtown, deep in the alley, the dark night
Get's slit up, when lightning strikes
Get up!
Meltdown, taking you home, the unknown
Countdown, hitting the ground, the seeds grown
Downtown, deep in the alley, the dark night
Get's slit up, when lightning strikes
Get up!


[B-Real]
Take a ride
When lightning strikes, city lights are gleaming
No sunshine, no California dreaming
The demon is roaming on the loose, you got juice
Up for abuse, when electric currents are induced
?, rock on, the brain waves
What you clocking, I be dropping the bomb, you getting maimed
The games you play, look up and say you want to change
And rearrange, the strange, you never go the way
Don't look back, forget that, you need that
Just sit back, look at the show, and see that
Display the raw power, black out
Even the score, open the door, and break out
Leave it alone, the unknown fury, blind rage
Move aside, get wise and make the front page
Center stage, you ?, and leave with
Go suffer the pain, leave us alone, or be fixed
The heart beat, pumping your blood, high pressure
Look at you stuck in the mud, bring in the stretcher
Strapped down, ready to roll, the god knows
Tears coming down, the bucking, so ? slow

[B-Real &amp; Sen-Dog]
Meltdown, taking you home, the unknown
Countdown, hitting the ground, the seeds grown
Downtown, hitting the alley, the dark night
Get's slit up, when lightning strikes
Get up!
Meltdown, taking you home, the unknown
Countdown, hitting the ground, the seeds grown
Downtown, hitting the alley, the dark night
Get's slit up, when lightning strikes
Get up!</pre>
