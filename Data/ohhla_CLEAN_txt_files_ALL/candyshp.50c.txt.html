[Intro - 50 Cent]
Yeah
Uh huh
So seductive
 
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead girl, don't you stop
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - Olivia (50 Cent)]
I'll take you to the candy shop (yea)
Boy, wanna taste what I got (uh huh)
I'll have you spending all you got (c'mon)
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Verse - 50 Cent]
You could have it your way
How do you want it?
You gonna back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature rising, ok
Let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle
I break it down for you now, baby it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teaching you about how strong I got you
When you show me what you working baby, No problem
Get on top, get your bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet, when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm trying to explain baby, the best way I can
I melt in your mouth girl, not in your hand (uh huh)
 
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead girl, don't you stop
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, wanna taste what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Bridge - 50 Cent (Olivia)]
Girl what we do (what we do)
And where we do (and where we do)
The things we do (things we do)
Are just between me and you, yea (oh yeah, yea)
 
[Verse - 50 Cent]
Give it to me baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
Cuz I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door, she kept pulling on my zipper
It's like a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs
Had me thinking about that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow mo on the floor when we grind
No she ain't stopping homie and I ain't stopping
Dripping wet with sweat, man it's on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gonna sip that heavy bubble man, every bottle is gone
 
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead girl, don't you stop
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, wanna taste what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead girl, don't you stop
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, wanna taste what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa</pre>
