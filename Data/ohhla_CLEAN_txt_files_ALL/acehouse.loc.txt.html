Tone, put that big ass size thirteen on and kick it for the homies
{*Tarzan yell*}
Just call him my dog, man

[Tone Loc]
(Verse 1)
Trix/tricks are for kids, and men are for tricks
Ace
He's the number one pet
Dick
No need for a fireman
When your cat's up a tree, he's the one that you hire, man
Known to bring 'em back alive
If your cat's scratched, or if your turkey got jive
A little loco en la cabeza, but still got charm
Brought 'em back to Ol' MacDonald's farm
So hey diddle diddle, what's laid in the park
Chasin' more pets than Noah's Ark
No need for a paint if numbers get deleted
Ace on the case, and the job is completed
Simple as Simon, when I start rhymin'
Always tell the truth, so you know I'm not lyin'
Down with the ladies as a lover
Undercover

Break 1:
[Tone]  Yo, tell 'em where he's at, my brothers
[Crowd] Yo, Ace is in the house
        Yo, Ace is in the house
[Tone]  Yo, tell 'em where Ace is at
[Crowd] Yo, Ace is in the house
[Tone]  Uh, I don't believe they heard you
[Crowd] Yo, Ace is in the house
[Tone]  Is he all up in the house
[Crowd] Yo, Ace is in the house
        Yo, Ace is in the house
        Yo, Ace is in the house
        Yo, Ace is in the house

(Verse 2)
Well
If Ace is in the house, so must be Loc
Blowin' up like a cloud of smoke
Checkin' all of his bitches at home
But I'm the dog with the biggest bone (WOOF!)
I grip the mic like pliers, no one's flyer
Yo, Ace is for hire
A floor room show piece
Solvin' more crimes than the hot damn police
Tryin' to do it legal
Lookin' for a dolphin, beating on a eagle
Nothin' ever planned
Remember, Ace got the face of a helpful detective man
Crazy like Harpo
Busted-out windows in his Monte Carlo
Loud clothes, black boots
Dutch style hair, no time for a suit
But I don't give a damn if he's way out
Yo, tell him who's in the house

Break 2:
[Crowd] Yo, Ace is in the house
[Tone]  I don't believe they heard ya
[Crowd] Yo, Ace is in the house
[Tone]  Yo, tell 'em one more time
[Crowd] Yo, Ace is in the house
[Tone]  Tell 'em who's in the house
[Crowd] Yo, Ace is in the house
[Tone]  I don't believe they heard ya
[Crowd] Yo, Ace is in the house
[Tone]  Is he runnin' thangs
[Crowd] Yo, Ace is in the house
[Tone]  Is he doin' thangs
[Crowd] Yo, Ace is in the house
[Tone]  I need to know
[Crowd] Yo, Ace is in the house

[Jim Carrey]
Don't worry, ma'am
Ace'll find your pussy
CAT, that is

[Tone Loc]
You know, uh, Ace
I was, uh, checking you out and everythang, and
I have to admit
You are the best pet detective there is
Although, uh, you are the only pet detective there is, but
You're still number one
I got to go, uh
My zebra's double parked outside
Peace
To the west side tribe
Tell 'em who's in the house

[Female]
Ace is in the house
I said Ace in the house
I said Ace in the house
I said Ace in the house

[Crowd]
Yo, Ace is in the house
Yo, Ace is in the house
Yo, Ace is in the house
Yo, Ace is in the house
Yo, Ace is in the house
Yo, Ace is in the house
Yo, Ace is in the house
Yo, Ace is in the house</pre>
