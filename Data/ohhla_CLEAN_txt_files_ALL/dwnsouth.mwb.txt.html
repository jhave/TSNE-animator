[Chorus 2x: Snoop Dogg]
Down south smuggling cash, Hustlin for cash
Bustin my ass, Just to live 1st class
As the game rotate, I regulate to innovate
City to city, State to state, Don't hate

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I get up early in the morning, I take a blunt to the head
Gets my kids out the bed
Jump out, Do what I have to
Mack two, Four or five bitches just to keep my game on tight
Snoop d-o-double-gizzie keep it busy, keep it dizzy
Keep these people guessin
I ain't stressin, Now the lesson
Is this, When you in the mix of tryin to get yo chips
Seperate yo friends from yo bitch
Now this is this, This is this, And this that
Cause once upon a time the homies try to jack
They tried to creep on double g from the back
So I had to move down south, Is it right?, Is it like that?
Ain't no need for me to tell y'all what the fuck popped off
Niggaz tryed to take my chips and then they got knocked off
Snoop dogg don't be playin, I be sayin the real
I'm serious bout this paper dogg, And I might get killed
If I keep it too real, Let me spill my guts, Over this track
To let you niggaz know how I act
I get the chedder, Keep it better
Keep my sweater on close
Just in case these niggaz take a trip out the coast
And try to catch me slippin, I ain't slippin no more
Let me smoke this indo and then I count my dizzough
And when I hit the shtizzo, Or better yet the schizzo
You can gaurantee, I'm gauranteed to show

Chorus 2x

[Abel]
Yeah nigga, West coast, Down south
Hookin up, Breakin bread, Makin paper, Nigga
Boss player, Get at them niggaz

[Verse 2: Boss Player]
Snoop, I feel ya nigga, Boss player I'm boss scrilla
When there's beef, Shit gets realer, Niggaz be tryin to get familiar
Now i'll spill ya for a buck, Nigga fuck wit this principal
What? you got a vest on ya chest?, I'll aim for ya head, Cause nigga ya not invincible
Cause after all day, Hustlin cash, Bustin my ass
A nigga think they gon fuck up my cash
Ya throwed off and funkin like trash, fuckin wit the rotation
I'm tryin to sling brick city to city, And get off probation
And niggaz be hatin, Snoop you said these niggaz was snitches
And niggaz be waitin to call the cops and gossip like bitches
But I ain't trippin, I'ma live first class and let hoes pass
And handle my business, Cause dogg, It's all about cash

[Chorus 2x: Boss Player]
Down south, Hustlin cash, Bustin my ass
Just to live first class
As the game rotate, I regualte to innovate
City to city, state to state, Don't hate

[Outro: Kane]
Whassup, Snoop nigga, I see ya, What's the deal nigga?
