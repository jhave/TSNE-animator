[Snoop Dogg]
Ain't nuttin to it but to do it
Let me holla at you baby
I know a lot of NFL players and a lot of NBA players (Sexy gurl!)
Like to holla at you, you know, but it's different hollering at me
You know what I'm saying? (Sexy gurl!)
Whatever they can give you, (laughs) I can give it to you times two
(Sexy gurl, but I really need you gurl!)
 But in a gangsta way, can you dig it?

[Trina]
I woke up around ten o'clock this morning
I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawning
Went to the bathroom to wash up
Put on my French-lace panties and my Enyce warm-up
I said, "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the baddest bitch of them all?"
There was a quick pause
Then the mirror responded, "You know you got it locked stop actin' retarded."
Fa sho, that's why these bitches don't want beef
Cause I, flash the Roley with the all yellow deese
Got the sunflower-yellow on the fingernails
And the yellow Louie bag with the pastels
Yo I'm livin' like a model while my rap sales (Why?)
Cause niggaz love the way my back swells
Plus I show my ladies how to mack males
Fuck posin' for BlackTail, I'm bout to sign a PlayBoy deal, unh

[Chorus]
Sexy gurl, (sexy, sexy)
You're my little sexy gurl (sexy gurl)
And I really love you gurl (love you gurl)
Said I really need you gurl (I need you gurl)
Put no one above you gurl (above you gurl)
Wanna kiss and hug you gurl (hug you gurl)
You're a little sexy gurl (sexy, sexy)
But I really love you gurl (love you gurl)
Come a little

[Snoop Dogg]
Close to the P-I- mpin'
Hop in the Coupe with Snoop go on a mission (mission)
Nonstop no intermission, breakfast in bed
We do head in the kitchen (ooooh!)
It's a lo-ve-ly day
You can hang out in the pool, act a fool or just bubble and bathe
And when you get it I love how you don't talk about me
But you lovin' the Dogg, that's what I like about it
M-I-A don't get in my way, the baddest bitch with the play-yi-yay (play-yi-yay)
And everyday I try to get my play on
This California lifestyle help you stay on (stay on)
I'm choppin' it up, (choppin' it up) I got the key so I'm lockin' it up (lockin' it up)
Flashin' 'em, (flashin' 'em) blastin' 'em (blastin' 'em)
I'm rollin' with a boss bitch passin' 'em
Come here cutie

[Chorus]
Sexy gurl (sexy, sexy)
You're my little sexy gurl (sexy gurl)
And I really love you gurl (love you gurl)
Said I really need you gurl (I need you gurl)
Put no one above you gurl (above you gurl)
Wanna kiss and hug you gurl (hug you gurl)
You're a little sexy gurl (sexy, sexy)
But I really love you gurl (love you gurl)

[Bridge]
Break it down (sexy, sexy)
Unh huh (yeah) (sexy gurl)
All my sexy ladies clap to this (love you gurl) that's right
All my sexy ladies clap to this (need you gurl) come on
Oh, (above you gurl) yeah (above you gurl) Oh!
All my sexy ladies clap to this (come on)
All my sexy ladies clap to this, come a little

[Trina]
Better than Fendi and Gucci
You need a little more for me to be a groupie (that's right)
How bout a house down out  on San Succi
Sittin' on an acre so we could move loosely
That's just how it goes
Vera Wang from the window pane down to the tips of my toes (Oh!)
And when I'm ready to leave I pull a Porsche out
Don't want no sticks or no seeds I go to Snoop's house [laughter]
Fuck a professor, I need an investor (unh huh)
To eat me like Hannibal Lector
And keep me in a pink Kompressor, cups processor
And I don't want nuttin' lesser

[Repeat chorus &amp; Snoop's intro simultaneously]

[Snoop]
Let me holla at you baby
I know a lot of NFL players and a lot of NBA players (Sexy gurl!)
Like to holla at you, you know, but it's different hollering at me
You know what I'm saying? (Sexy gurl!)
Whatever they can give you, (laughs) I can give it to you times two
(Sexy gurl, but I really need you gurl!)
 But in a gangsta way, can you dig it?
So if you got time, like I know you got time
Come here sexy gurl and holla at the D-O double Gizzle fa shizzle (fa shizzle)

Sexy gurl!
Sexy gurl!
