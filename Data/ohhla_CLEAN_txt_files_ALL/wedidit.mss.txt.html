We made love, now you gone
Now you don't wanna claim me no more
Told your boys, you never knew
You never kissed or held me in your arms
How dare you even leave
Me looking like I'm lying on you
When you said it's all about me
I believe it cuz you made believe

1 - 	If you did it, then you did it
	Boy, you don't have to lie
	Once you hit, then you hit it
	I'm no chick on the side

	Just forget it, gon' omit it
	Don't you, don't you dare try
	You done hit it, you done hit it 
	More than, more than two times

Repeat 1

You changed your phone, won't call me back
Now I can't even get in touch with you
See how you do, I never knew 
That you would deny this love I'm servin' you
That ain't cool, I'm hatin' you
Because you was the first to make the move
Now you say you never knew
You make your boys think that I'm some crazy fool

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

You know we did it, yep we did it boy
Why must you lie?
I drove your whip, you picked me up
You told me, meet you outside
We had some blunts like what the..
Gettin' high in your ride
Getting mushy, want some pussy
Get your biggest supply

Yeah, we did it, you was with it
That was all on your mind 
Then you hit it, can't admit it 
Then you wastin' my time
I won't forget it, need to quit it 
Put it all behind
Why you did it, why you did it
If you gon' have to lie

Bone me, phony
Sex me then you disown me 
Homies told me 
This is how all dogs will be

Repeat 1
Repeat 1
Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Yeah, yeah
More than two times
Uh, chicky chicky, uh</pre>
