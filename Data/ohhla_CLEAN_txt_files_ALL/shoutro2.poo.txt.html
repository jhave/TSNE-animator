("Angel of my life, watching on me")

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Gotta put some phase on my voice
("Look of love, look of love, look of love")
Multiphase ("That last for eternity") {Family Biz} 

Yo.. waddup! I wanna thank y'all for tunin in
Hope I ain't take up too much of your time, y'know?
Yo...

Four years in the makin, I gotta thank those
Who stuck by me, cause I require patience
To search for perfection, comin up short
And yet and still energized by support
I'm back to business, discard the training wheels
I'm like a sniper on the roof - trained to kill
My aim is ill as I watch emotions spill
on the pages, now I'm thinkin 'bout my next meal
Next song, next record, next deal
Let me take a moment to express how I feel
This is gratitude, this is so far removed
from most niggaz, and they attitudes
I'm just a regular nigga, this ain't regular shit
I don't know 'bout y'all, I was born with a gift
Who you know that can riff, like ya ol' boy
Eddie Kang Jr. and I finish this - sheeeeeit~!
