* Music from 'Tears of a Killa' fades out

[Butch Cassidy]
So let's just get this party started now!

[W.C.]
Uhh! Yeah, what we're drinking on? - What we're smoking on?
What we're drinking on? - What we're smoking on?
What we're drinking on? - Yeah

[Butch Cassidy]
So let's just get this party started now!

[Verse One: W.C.]
Deep, deep, deep as the Pacific
I steer through, rag on my rearview, Sound System be snoking
Hit the Rémy Martin of that sticky geeky in your coffin
Got these.. whores on my dick nigga!
Watch me.. make this four flip nigga
Killer Cali, the love ain't gone
Just shit ain't being the same since Dub done gone
Drunken, Square dumping, home of the trunking
Hit it to get the function jumping
Ds on thirteens, my shit bumping
Smelling like a fifth of something
West Up! - roll the dank up, hold a drink up (Come On!)
Smoke it up, put something in the cub nigga
Lay your head back, recline the leather
Today is the get together (YEAH!)

[Chorus: W.C.]
Relax yourself, let your body be free
Don't worry about a thing, bail with Dub-C (Come again)
We got freaks to meet, meat to eat
A whole lot of drink and a bomb assed Weed
It's The Get together (What?)
The Get together, to get together (Nigga)
Let's get together (Hey! Uhh!)
The Get together, to get together

[Butch Cassidy]
So let's just get this party started now!

[Verse Two: W.C.]
Let it rain, let it drizzlip, niggaz better learn
The Zig-Zag still gonna burn
We're in packs in the park, in the back of the park
Drinking like, in dark, giving our middle fingers to NARCs
I know they can't stand us, mad at our riches
Hitting fucking switches at niggaz and bad bitches (DAMN!)
Drinking like Rap Stars in Dickies
Just trying slang Lo-Los to the Japanese from Fifty
But we got no Rap Record, we got Jail Records
And Drive warrants, from 211 to hot ones
Cock guns, plot for fun
Shooting dice in a circle full of niggaz for Huns
The luxury is we all trust
But the Parking Lot looking like toys all rust
Came along way from cocking zones up
Down as Louie 13th to start our phone cups, nigga

[Chorus: W.C.]

[Interlude: Butch Cassidy]
So let's just get this party started now!
Let's get together, bring the drink and tread (Yeah!)
Soon as it's here, we shall proceed (Come On!)
Girls in the house, that's all we need (Yeah! Light it up!)
Party people indeed (Light it up! Light it up!)
Let's get together, bring the drink and tread
Soon as it's here, we shall proceed
Girls in the house, that's all we need (Drink it up!)
Party people indeed (Yeah!)

[Verse Three: W.C.]
Can't stop, won't stop, til the One Time break us
Claiming we're disturbing the neighbors
Then we're gonna make the Hundred Spokes twirl out
Cause it's on at the homegirl's house
Plus, she got the bomb ass curl, to set your head free
No Crystal, just yacing the 'gniac and eat
A ghetto bitch down to fuck
I'm talking who can suck a good dick and hook the cock go up
Got us all at her mama's house, playing Dominoes
Dear niggaz and a lot of whores
In the front room, cha cha-ing to the old and fresh
At the Chin Chilla cassette of old Ds
But I don't mind, it's all good on mine
Cause I keep it all hood on mine, pack a nine
Fuck a record, ghetto nigga forever
Let's get this Fuck Session cracking, bitch!

[Chorus: W.C. X2]

[Butch Cassidy]
So let's just get this party started now! now! now!

[Outro:]
[Toones] What's happening Granny?
[Granny] On patrol in the hood, I'm turning whores in .. hoods
[Homeb.] What's up Granny?
[Granny] Who is this nigga?
[Toones] Oh! it's the homeboy, he's straight, she's committed
[Granny] Nigga, are you buying?
[Homeb.] No Granny, not..
[Granny] Keep it that way..</pre>
