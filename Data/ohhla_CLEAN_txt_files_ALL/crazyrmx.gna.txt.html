[Joe Budden]
Yo... you ever wake up feeling unusual?
I mean, it's funny what a bad mood'll do
I know some might say I'm not suitable
or maybe I lost my mind, I'm delusional
I mean, when I speak they act like they don't hear me..
When I'm in the streets, they don't wanna come near me
I'm just a little different. Just a little weirdy
When I'm in the hood, be just a little weary
or maybe that's just how I was raised
Trynna find me from ceaser to the grave
Dropped outta school to be around apes
You know I'd do whatever to be around papes
Started gettin more green for kicks
More jeans, more vicodins, some weed, a little morphine
Just need to put my soul in the cleaners
Please lord, forgive me. I'm on my own penis
Am I crazy cuz I really mean this?
Or are y'all stupid and I'm really a genius
We don't think the same
I'm like Josh Howard, I need timeout, but it'd cost the game
Brave nigga, comin to age nigga
Plus in my mind I'm bumpin Gravediggaz
I'm jacked up and I'm tellin my boys
The roof's spinnin around like Jamiroquai
So if you lookin in and you look, the way things look
It don't look like things are lookin up
When I'm in the stew, I'm cookin up
My heart's poundin, got chills, I'm shooken up
I'm out of control... Basically a madman
Trynna make board, I'm workin with a bad hand
I'm stuck and I'm bleeding so
there's really only one thing that I need to know..

[Cee-Lo] + (Joe Budden)
Does that make me crazy? (Nahmean?)
Does that make me crazy? (I don't really think I'm too crazy.. Ya know!)
Does that make me crazy? (I don't think I'm too different from everybody else...)
Probably... (Nah, maybe I am.)

[Cee-Lo]
And I hope that you are having the time of your life..
But think twice..
Thats my only advice..
Hmm... Come on now
Who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha!
Bless your soul!
You really think you're in control..
Well..

[Cee-Lo]
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Just like me..

[Cee-Lo]
My heros had the heart... to put their lives out on the limb..
And all I remember... is thinking I want to be like them..
Hmmm...
Ever since I was little..
Ever since I was little it looked like fun..
And it's no coincidence I've come..
And I can die when I'm done..

[Cee-Lo]
Maybe I'm crazy..
Maybe you're crazy..
Maybe we're crazy..
Probably...</pre>
