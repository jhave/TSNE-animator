Verse 3 *(Yukmouth)*

Playa 
give me some brew an I might just chill
but I'm the type that like to light another joint like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies
spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it
but it ain't enuff on it
fuck wit the S the T, I-D-E-S 
never the less
I'm hella fresh
rollin joints like a cigarrette
so pass it cross the table like ping pong
I'm gone
beatin my chest like King Kong
it's on,
wrap my lips around a 40
and when it comes to get another stogie
niggas all kick in like Shinobi
Nummy ain't my homie to begin with
it's too many heads to be poppin to let my friend hit shit
unless you pull out the phat crispy
five dollar bill 
on the real before its history
cuz niggas be havin' them vaccum lungs
an if you let 'em hit it for free
you hella dum-du-dum-dum
I come to school with the taylor on my earlobe
avoidin all the dick teasers 
skeezers and weirdos
that be fuckin off the land like Where tha bomb at?
Give me two bucks
you take a puff
and pass my bomb back
suck up the dank like a slurpy
the serious 
bomb will make a nigga go delirous like Eddie Murphy
I got more growin pains than Maggie
cuz niggas snag me
to take the dank out of the baggie
