[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Dangerous!!! That's her song
Hips like Beyonce looks like Solange
Body like Serena fit like Venus
Everyone I know I'm tryin to give them the (AY!!! AY!!!)
Bad like she bad with money like Oprah
She wine to the reggae, bubble to soca
Cool like Taraji sweet like Nicole 
Scherzinger like Sharwhen she comin from the cold
Tall like Keri and sing like Estelle
Legs like Amerie and she don't tell
When she kiss, a down ass chick like Lil' Kim
She ready for the camera Kim Kardashian
Curves like Melissa, tough like Michelle (OBAMA!!!!)
All day the queen like Mary J.
Good like Keyshia, young like Ri Ri
Sayin ain't that Kardinal on the TV, you see me!!!
Remix, Kardinal, Akon, Sean Paul
Take our ting right straight to di wall
Dig it out tun it out now everybody shout one two!!!

[Chorus: Akon]
That girl is so dangerous, that girl is so DANGEROUS
That girl is a BAD GIRL!! I've seen her type before
She's so dangerous, that girl is so DANGEROUS
That girl is a BAD GIRL!! Yeahh

[Verse 2: Akon]
See your the type of girl that make me wait
I'm the type of guy that make you relocate
Participatin in no chase
Got all type of girls I'm 'gon be straight
Honeys like you come a dime a dozen
Real financially should be my cousin
Hips sprung think I am when I wasn't
And you wanna cling cling on me then be your husband
A baby daddy, a sugar daddy
I don't give a damn either way I'm a have it
The way I be shootin that gun automatic
Got chicks from every part of the world goin at it
Like they don't ask it, but it's so classic
How the club be gettin broken down in masses
By the same chicks with these big ol' asses
Just droppin and shakin it fast
It's so dangerous, it's so dangerous, she's so dangerous

[Chorus: Akon] (Sean Paul)
Watch out I've seen her type before
That girl is so dangerous, that girl is so DANGEROUS
That girl is a BAD GIRL!! I've seen her type before
She's so dangerous, that girl is so DANGEROUS
That girl is a BAD GIRL!! Yeahh

[Verse 3: Sean Paul] (Kardinal Offishall)
Inna mi ride mi a di king wid di crown just cruisin along

This woman deh a eyes up di Dutty and a gwaan like she waan come gimme di heat
All few a dem pack up and now mi waan it Har man just stand up and guardin on it
She's dangerous so don't tek fah granted
Har appetite for sex she waan mi plant it
Blatantly she waan fi flaunt it
Showin mi how much she waan mi on it
Waan mi con it she waan mi stamp it
Wid di lethal weapon dat she waan mi slam it

She wink back and she waan mi bomb it
Excitement she waan mi carve it (HOLD UP SEAN!!!!!!)

That girl is so dangerous, that girl is so DANGEROUS
That girl is a BAD GIRL!! I've seen her type before
She's so dangerous, that girl is so DANGEROUS
That girl is a BAD GIRL!! Yeahh

[Verse 4: Twista]
How she, full with adrenaline feelin all sowed up
Fillin 'em filled with venom kill 'em like a cobra
Thinkin I'm in danger when I tell her come over
Like a scary endeavor whenever I hold her
Speakin in tongues just speedin my lyrical pace
Look at the fanny now look at the body now take a look at the face
Dangerous as Angelina Jolieand more than a man eater
Manipulatin any man if she want him
Cause a, we be spectacular mackin in back in the truck in the Acura
But she need to act up and let out the boys in us
Havin a premonition then I'm reminiscin 
About a girl with New Edition already says she's poisonous
Like Paris Hilton, Nicole or Lindsay Lo
Madonna, Naomi or Giselle the blanco, OHHHH!!!!
My life will never let a bomb chick abuse it
It's Kardinal, Twista, Konvict music

[Outro: Kardinal Offishall]
Just gotta remember she's dangerous, she's dangerous, she's dangerous
Cause she's a bad, bad girl!!!!
She's dangerous, she's dangerous, she's dangerous
Cause she's a bad, bad girl!!!!</pre>
