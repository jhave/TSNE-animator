"You'll be always mine... all through your life
 think you'll find, you'll be always mine...
 all through your life, think you'll find
 you'll be always mine"

[Sadat X]
You gon' always be mine, no matter who else in line
And deep down, you know that in your heart
We occasionally live life dreams
Time stood still, and split up the seams
Years can be brutal but it served you well
You mighta gained a pound but I can't tell
Who me?  I'm in the same vein, healthy
Not as wealthy as I wanna be, but I'm aight
But to you that never mattered anyway
I couldn't stand in yo' way when you choose to grow
Said you had to follow yo' lifelong dreams
to the lands of the stars, cameras, lights
Bright sunny days and we parted our ways
Then the hourglass with the sand slipped fast
Now we are where we are today, in oh-four
And maybe it'll happen once more
But if don't, know our time together was golden
Memories I'ma keep holdin, and know I'm here
And one more thing my dear ("All through your life, think you'll find")
("You'll be always mine... all through your life
 think you'll find, you'll be always mine...")

[Lord Jamar]
Yo, we first met in junior high
I was so shy, you was so fly
At first I done knew you would be mine
Clocked in, started doin my time
Walkin you home, hours, we talked on the phone
Eventually, we started to bone
In a whirlwind, you became my girlfriend
We used to both rock the matchin Sherlings
With the sweatshirts, with our names on it
On the back it had our love proclaimed on it
Then we broke up, and got back together
Then we broke up, and got back together
It was like that, for what seemed forever
Then it got to the point that we had to sever
The years had passed
And wouldn't you know it, met and her yo we crossed paths
And I have to laugh
Cause it didn't take nuttin for a nigga to smash, cause
("All through your life, think you'll find")
("You'll be always mine... all through your life
 think you'll find, you'll be always mine...")

[Grand Puba]
I couldn't wait to walk to school each day
And wait for you to pass my way (uh-huh)
I never really had nuttin to say, but
how ya doin, and have a nice day
Until one day, one Monday
I put the mack down, recess playground
Ever since then homegirl been down
Feelin my style cause I wasn't no clown
From, element through the college days
Did shows after school, used to bring you backstage
We reminisce on how we used to play
When I got sick, you got sick the same days
Okay? (okay) you know how that go (yeah)
Mom at work, so we got the fo'
Half hour for the cleanup then you out the do'
Walked down one flight to be safe fo' sho'
After, all that shorty love still with it
How I put my thang down and the way I hit it, so
("All through your life, think you'll find")
("You'll be always mine... all through your life
 think you'll find, you'll be always mine...")</pre>
