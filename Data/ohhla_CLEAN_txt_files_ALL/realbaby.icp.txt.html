Underground baby
Real underground baby..

[Violent J]
This clown don't smile and honk your nose
This clown don't wear big goofy clothes
This clown don't mind your hatred for me
You'll get turned into a dead corpse right before me

Real underground baby..

[Violent J &amp; (Shaggy 2 Dope)] - x2
And the preacherman said..
(HALLELUJAH!)
And the preacherman said..
(HALLELUJAH!)
And the preacherman said..
(HALLELUJAH!
Me and the Witch gonna do it to ya!)

[Violent J]
Role model, eat a dick up and swallow
Only model I follow be the Jim Beam bottle
And I'ma kick a fuckin' hole in the wall
I'ma kick a fuckin' hole in the wall
Full throttle, punchin' in an El Dorado
Full bottle, I care about no tomorrow
When I'ma kick a fuckin' hole in the wall
I'ma kick a fuckin' hole in the wall

[Shaggy 2 Dope &amp; (Girl)]
Who can paint their face up?
(Who can paint their face up?)
And wear a ninja suit?
(And wear a ninja suit?)

[Violent J &amp; (Shaggy 2 Dope)]
Floatin' through some backyards
Dropkick your knees and backwards
I'm outtie with a *poof!*
(And ain't that shit the truth!?)

[Violent J]
My days are long and lonely
Black rain is right before me

Real underground baby


My brain does nothing for me
Heyy! This pain'll be my story

[The Ringleader]
Who took the chicken off the plate
And put it in the fridge?!
SHAGGY 2 DOPE DID!!

Underground baby...real underground baby

[Violent J] - x4
I'm hidin' under the floor like Saddam
But I'm, doin' it because I love it
And I'm, underground baby
Real underground baby

Underground baby...real underground baby
Underground baby...real underground baby
Real underground baby

[Shaggy 2 Dope &amp; (Girl)]
Who can paint their face up?
(Who can paint their face up?)
And wear a ninja suit?
(And wear a ninja suit?)

[Violent J &amp; (Shaggy 2 Dope)]
Floatin' through some backyards
Dropkick your knees and backwards
I'm outtie with a *poof!*
(And ain't that shit the truth?)

My days are long and lonely

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Underground!
Underground, 2 miles deep
Under your feet

Underground!
Underground, 2 miles deep
Under the street

By far the ugliest and most monsterous thing
I have ever seen
