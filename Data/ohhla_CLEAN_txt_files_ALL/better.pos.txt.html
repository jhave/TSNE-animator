[Chorus]
All in together now
Things go better now
All in together
Things go better

[Verse One]
I started slangin' tapes way back in '99
Founded Weightless, Greenhouse was on our grind
Then MhZ was comin' up at the same time
No monetary perks but our names got a little shine
Back when I used to rhyme in ciphers all day
True skills told me that I need to meet RJ
I did at the next show
I'm makin' some small change
The next at the Expo we met in the hallway
Talked about me solo and us collaborated
A single that was promo and beats he said he was makin' 
From the crew on the low low so we wasn't nameless
Stole our name from a fuckin' soul night he used to play at
I'm holdin' down a job he's tryin' to stay in school
Week days was hard but weekends was available
Started gettin' props from friends on other labels
Next thing you know we got our own deal on the table

[Chorus]
All in together now
Things go better now
All in together
Things go better

[Verse Two]
Dead Ringer hit first then came Unlimited
We finally got heard, fans was feelin' it
Tried to make our tour work, the pieces didn't fit
So we rolled out separate on some different shit
When you come up the way that I came up
Rolling out solo might not seem right to you
And even if you're talented enough to succeed
You feel incomplete if your people ain't beside you
And almost overnight I gave up my home life
My 365 was hotels and long drives
Withdrew from people that I known my whole life
And lost everything that resembled a normal life
And RJ is dealin' with his own shit
He wanted to quit before 8 Million Stories hit
We had to cancel most of our first tour
We did what we could but I wish we did more

[Chorus]
All in together now
Things go better now
All in together
Things go better

[Verse Three]
But guess what happened along the way
People got the album, went home, pressed play
Recognized our talents, felt what we had to say
Called it, "A classic", supporting us to this day
What I thought was a curse was really a blessing
A lesson learned in maturity and tough decisions
And workin' through whatever obstacle had us stressin'
Till we improved our level of communication
But meanwhile, other cats I claim as friends
Acted foul to me, soon as shit hit the fan
They can't talk to me like a man and shake my hand
I let that petty shit slide so we can make amends
This ain't the industry
This is Soul Position
This ain't about fame, fortune or pretty women
So on our brokest days we'll still be the richest
Cause we got what really counts
Friendship
So how you feel?
What's your life about?
Is it real?
You got something to rhyme about?
You got skills or you wastin' time writin' it down?
Before you write another rhyme you better find out
Now frills
That's what my life about
I write it down to a beat I'm excited about
Then sit back and smile at how tight it sounds
Cause things went better this time around
What

[Chorus]
All in together now
Things go better now
All in together
Things go better</pre>
