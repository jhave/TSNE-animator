Polow Da Don

[R. Kelly]
It's Kells! Haters start your engines!

4'5", lookin fly
Flo-flo-flossin in that white L-I
Shawty checkin fo' a playa
Like she wan' hop in wit a playa
Girlfriend on some hatin shit
She like shit, that's Kells, bitch
And then I stop like, real nice!
Scooped them up like, hitch hike!
Th-th-then I let 'em come with me
Step up in the club with one on each sleeve
Doug E. Fresh kid, 'bout to spend that cheese
And after that you know they gon' leave with me
We out of here, get 'em to the crib
Straight to the mansion, show 'em how I live
An-an-and you can tell that the sex is major
Cause only one day later

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
They got Kells on they ringtone (ringtone)
I hear Kells on they ringtone (ringtone)
They got Kells on they ringtone (ringtone)
They got Kells on they ringtone (ringtone)
All the shorties got Kells on they ringtone (ringtone)
I hear Kells on they ringtone (ringtone)
All the honeys got Kells on they ringtone (ringtone)
I hear Kells on they ringtone (ringtone)

[Polow Da Don]
Ladies!
Hold up, ya phone if you got me on ya ringtone {*4X*}

[R. Kelly]
Let me take you shoppin babe
Meet me right by Macy's babe
Leave your purse, I'm crazy paid
Wa-wa-walk in and go crazy babe
I'm tellin you money ain't a thing to me
Kells spend it on you like wheels on jeeps
Then after the mall to the Ritz we creep
Sex, put it on you like shoes on feet
Money stacked, club hoppin
Leanin back, be-be-beat droppin
All night, non stoppin
Club close, we popped and lockin
Y'all goin to the spot from here? (Yessir)
Is there an afterparty after this? (Yessir)
Are y'all takin them honeys with? (Yessir)
Are y'all on some ol' freaky shit? (Yessir, yup!)

[Chorus]

[Polow Da Don]
Hold up, ya phone if you got me on ya ringtone {*3X*}
Hold up, ya phone
Ay, wait a minute!

[R. Kelly]
You play me in your car and you play me in your home
Now it's time to download Kells on your ringtone
From ghetto girls, college girls, all the way to strippers
To fire 'dro smokers and all the Henny sippers
Big chip spenders, big money tippers
At the bar takin shots with my niggaz
No fake niggaz, no hatin niggaz
But shots of Patrón for all my real niggaz
Girls in the hotel gettin it on and
they ain't leavin 'til 6 in the mornin
The superstar chick's too drunk to drive home
Wake up next day and uhhh (ha ha ha)

[Chorus]

[Polow Da Don]
Ladies!
Hold up, ya phone if you got me on ya ringtone {*4X*}
Yeah
Ha ha
Get money!</pre>
