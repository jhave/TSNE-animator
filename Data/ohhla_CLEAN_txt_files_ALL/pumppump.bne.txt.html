[Intro: Krayzie]
That's right Bone Thugs-N-Harmony back up in this muthafucka
Nigga, duce double 0 duce
Lay, B, Wish Flesh
[Bone Thug Bone Thug Bone Thug]
I think its time we take these niggas back to the god-damn streets [swattin nigga]
And gave these niggas some of that original [original cleveland heat] heat
Thuggish ruggish bone see
Gun stack off

[Verse 1: Layzie]
See a nigga got fully automatics and I let them loose
Tha 12 gauge two grenades nigga got them too
Ya damn right I shoot
If a nigga run up on you I'ma get him and I spill like I s'posed to do
And If I roll wit you
Ima be that little nigga off the hook man
Talk about look man
If I see anigga disrespect one mo time
Put out my foot on his line and leave him burnt up cookin
Yeah I break off off my heat cuz when I'm in the streets
And I hit these streets
I'ma keep my peace until a nigga want beef
But If he fuckin wit me then Ima turn raw meat cuz
I'm just a Bone Thug little bitty nigga wit strong nutz
Platinum eva since E put us down
You know the talk of the town them long bud
Now you fuckin wit a lion strugglin tryin to see these thugs
Tryna get rid of us like the war on drugs
But a nigga keep comin like I told you he was
So lemme close the door
Don't be comin to this muthafucka knockin
Lookin for some action
I'ma tell you right now what's happenin
Nigga it's our time and hell yeah we blastin

[Hook: Krayzie]
If yall muthafuckas think we willin
P-U-M-P nigga come on wit it
You ain't gotta listen nigga Ima make you feel it
Pump, Pump, Buck buck buck buck buck
Buck buck

If yall muthafuckas think we willin
P-U-M-P nigga come on wit it
You ain't gotta listen but I'ma let you hear it
Pump, Pump, Buck buck buck buck buck
Buck buck

[Verse 2: Krayzie]
Leathaface in the place and I'm warned you niggas
I'm coming quicker than a goddamn missile
Movin and huntin, steady winnin out a nigga
With penetration equivalent to muthafuckin pistols
I get up in ya system cripple a nigga quick
I'm rippin a nigga shit like grippin a nigga bitch and sell this
You see I shoot fo the temple
I'ma try to bust a nigga mental in the middle of his dome
Back up in this muthafucka wait a minute nigga we neva left
Ain't even got started yet [yeah]
We kickin in the muthafuckin door
Once again for war so nigga get ya army ready
I got a nation of niggas ready to fuck up the enemy
If i give em the oil them nigga show me they warriors
All ova we victorious takin ova ya territory
Notorious and devil-alition and we know a level
All you feel it when I kill it hit it spit it
Get it crackin in this muthafucka right when we the illest
Same muthafuckas got the fuck up outta Cleveland
Nigga we came up but we still creepin
And we still put it down nigga even though we four strong
Flesh gone come home, Bone gone stay Bone
When the 5th Dawg gets loose it gone be on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bizzy]
It's the original bang bang and I don't give a fuck about none of these muthafuckas
Still get down foe my damn thang
Tell a nigga that I concentrate come on down to the land let us blastinate
People lookin at me like he's too nasty to date
Gimme my dick back we in the last days every second got a muthafucka passin away
Fast to the bass that we fell wit the jazz and ah [buck buck buck buck buck buck buck buck]
In a mask at my home with no men in a mansion to get a little piece of this American dream
I spit venom thru the pipes as I smoke in em
I shit rhythm and I'm nice ain't no competition (fart sound) [Ewwww]
It smell good and the weed still sell good for the lay bits
Talkin bad like you ready to blaze nigga you ain't mad
[ What the fuck you think you doing..........]
I give a fuck who you ridin with or that nigga that you slidin with
He ain't a killa he just somebody to vibe with
Somebody tell this nigga motha who he died with
So silly!! [So silly silly silly silly ]
Pumped up Big Willy I don't really think he really
I don't really think he really, I don't think he know!
Hit him with the crossbow monto-mental little lost soul
I been on so!!!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
Niggas the Thugs homie we the muthafuckas that be ready to roll
You know niggas that be waitin in the blisterin cold for you to come home
Sneak in the door and we go go
I ain't gotta hear what you tryna prove
Put ya hands on ya nuts and get ready to move
And I can't why I'm thug mighty
Gang of thugs that thug just like me
I don't give a fuck if its north or south
If a nigga talkin shit we gone wipe his mouth
That's just how it is put it on my kids
Bodies zipped up fuck that fuckin wit Wish

While these niggas steady chillin
If it ain't about the money don't comment
Cuz I don't undastand it like you from anotha planet
Cuz its all about money god dammit
