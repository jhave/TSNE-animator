For the funky beats I made I get for my grade 
I'm from the Dangerous Crew, I can't hang with you 
Cause I'm from Oakland, bitch, where the game is true 
You don't belive me? Well, come on slide through 
Because the city of dope will give you somethin' to ride to 
Put my tape in your deck and do some damages 
But the six by nines, they can't handle this 
I'm twenty-three so I'm far from a young buck 
This gin and juice is gettin' me pumped up 
Fake rappers get chumped up 
You wanna slang'em, watch your face gettin' lamped up 
Well, what's my name? You can call me Banks for short 
You wanna book me? You're about to see a gangsta show 
Cause I be tighter than tight, give me a brew and the mic 
And it will be on like chickenbone, you know that's right 
Some mothafuckas didn't belive that I can do this shit 
Kick some funky ass rhymes with some beats that hits 
Now I'm provin' them wrong but still suckas wanna clown 
But you jealous mothafuckas ain't bringin' me down 
I kept faith in myself, that's what I had to do 
To make it out here and stop fuckin' with you 
I'm 2 the head... 

Yeah! Now all you fake niggaz: get the fuck off my nuts! 

I got my shit rollin' so now I'm like a mack in town 
And when I'm ridin' through, the hoes be flaggin' me down 
I'm just a player kickin' funky shit with the Dangerous Clique 
And all these bitches, they out to get some famous dick 
But I ain't trippin', girl, you can bring that ass on 
Cause all this jockin' shit ain't guaranteed to last long 
But while it's happenin' you know I'm straight lovin' it 
You put your pussy in position and I'm pluggin' it 
But if you're lookin' for a nigga with a touch of affection 
You better take your ass to the love connection 
Cause, hoe, I ain't got no trust in you 
Cause if another rapper comes you'll be fuckin' him too 
And that's real, save the love for ????? 
Cause it's all about mackin' in 92 
One love, I ain't goin' that far 
I'm better known as a gigolo rap star 
I like to fuck groupie bitches cause it's fun too 
And I never get played cause I'm young true 
Hoes wanna be mine but that's a no no 
Get the fuck off my face, bitch, I'm 2 the head, hoe 

Now for verse three, you know it never quits 
Cause Ant Banks is in the house makin' hits 
And since I'm doin' this I gotta deal with jealous punks 
Mad cause my shit like pumps in the trunks 
And when I'm ridin' I gotta roll strapped in my 500 Benz 
Cause it's sittin' kinda phat, fake niggas smile on my face 
But they ain't bold ones 
Trippin' out cause they ain't ridin' on gold ones 
I know you're envies, that's hell of dumb for me 
Cause the shit I got, it didn't come for free 
Late nights at the studio bustin' my ass crack 
Tryin' to make hits, man, but where was your ass at? 
Probably at the corner drinkin' Old E, slangin' D 
See, you was sleepin', now everybody's know me 
I guess hard work pays and doin' nothin' is off 
Lazy niggas like you were once fuckin' us off 
Stop talkin' about me and get a J-O-B instead 
Bitch ass nigga, I'm 2 the head... 

Yeah and this goes out to all you shit talkin' 
bandwagon ridin' mothafuckas: get off... </pre>
