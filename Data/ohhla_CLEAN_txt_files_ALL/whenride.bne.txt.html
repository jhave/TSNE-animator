[Intro]
You know what it is baby
Rollin' with Hi Power Entertainment (we ride, we ride)
Bizzy Bone in the building, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
(We be ridin' never cause anything...)
Mr. Criminal shots out of love
We ride...

[Hook]
When we ride let me tell you who I'm rollin' with
Rollin' with Hi Power Entertainment...
All day all night that's right

When we ride let me tell you who I'm rollin' with
Rollin' with Hi Power Entertainment...
We ride, we ride, we ride

[Bizzy Bone]
In another I'm seein' the homi
Tellin' you jump on up in the ride
The bottles of wine
You didn't be prophesized
And I'm feelin' your vibe
I'm feelin' the tribe
That's up in Cleveland
Them Bone Thugs that's my family
The reason for the season
It don't leave 'em cause that's my family

[Mr. Criminal]
And the H-P-G's my family
We about to blow up
You just wait and see
Patiently, I've been waitin' "G"
Hop in the lowrider
Come escape with me
In a '63 clean Chevrolet Classic
Rollin' down the boulevard
Flossin' in the masses
Eyes blood shot
So I roll up with my glasses
From the West Coast
Where we turn it into ashes

[Bizzy Bone]
Everybody on the West Side
My papito, mamacita in the barrio
Tequila my amigo
Never disrespect you
You know I respect you, that's for sure
In the name of the Father
The Son
And the Holy Spirit
Praise the Lord
Now let us ride

[Hook]
When we ride let me tell you who I'm rollin' with
Rollin' with Hi Power Entertainment...
All day all night that's right

When we ride let me tell you who I'm rollin' with
Rollin' with Hi Power Entertainment...
We ride, we ride, we ride

[Mr. Criminal]
It's Mr. Criminal gone
Takin' hits from the bong
Head to (?) it's on
You better leave it alone
Do a show state to state
And I'm finally back home
Hooked up with a homeboy
Bizzy from Bone
And we finally clicked up
When we're doin' them things
Cause Bone Thug, Hi Power stay true to the game
Give the world another uncut hit of the bang
Bizzy Bone, Mr. Criminal spittin' the flame
Stay smokin' on "J"
And I'm feelin' divine
Turn it up when your downtown
Rollin' your ride
Windows up, hotboxed
And I'm feelin' the vibe
Pass it to the homi Bizzy
Watch 'em rip it with thai

[Bizzy Bone]
Little Bizzy the Kid
They better know what it is
And get a hold of your kids
You better put in your bid
You better put in your dibs
And never look into the criminal biz
You gotta be in it to win it
Sinnin' is treacherous and dangerous
But it ain't with the program
And slow jam feelin' that shit
Feelin' that shit
Wheelin' that wheel
Feelin' that shit
Come in another respective
Recollective were the past we missed it
My family, I'm left out on my damn knee
But I've got God
Tell 'em better get up
'Fore they come and try to get 'em gotta pay them
When I'm on them on a mission better listen
Passed away, and that's the way we play
Nigga go, go grab your fo'-fo'
Better go get 'em
Criminal did 'em
One big fam, bam my man
You know that you got to feel 'em
One time...

[Hook]
When we ride let me tell you who I'm rollin' with
Rollin' with Hi Power Entertainment...
All day all night that's right

When we ride let me tell you who I'm rollin' with
Rollin' with Hi Power Entertainment...
We ride, we ride, we ride

[Bizzy Bone]
Put your hands in the air like this, like this
And put your finger in the air like that, like that

Yeah, yeah

Everybody on the West Side
Everybody on the West Side

Put your finger in the air
And wave it like you don't care {laughs}
And wave it like you don't care

Put your finger in the air
And wave it like you don't care

[Outro]
The homi Bizzy bone
And the homi Mr. Criminal

The homi Bizzy bone
And the homi Mr. Criminal

When we ride...</pre>
