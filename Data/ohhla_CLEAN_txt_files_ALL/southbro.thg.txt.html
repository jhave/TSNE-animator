[Intro: Shabazz the Disciple]
Raziel, Seraphim, wings up
T.H.U.G. Angelz, Red Hook Projects
Fuck out the way, man

[Chorus: Shabazz the Disciple]
Here come the R-E, D-H, Double O, K
And you know we, gon' bring, trouble your way
The R-E-, D-H, Double O, K
And you know we, gon' bring, trouble your way

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Aiyo, my hood is like a max yard, it's all ganged out
When shit got real silent, niggas was bout to bang out
When them pitchers was in the kitchen, chipping off a mouse
Your credibility wasn't hood, niggas missed the count
I seen kingpins pay off cops, them missed a suite
And clapped, they arrest an officer when they got back on the streets
They workers had to walk a fourteen story ledge
Coming short, while they boss was clapping at they head
This kid caught eighteen in his head no the stoupe
When they pulled the sheets off him, shit look like a soup
I seen this nigga make the whole hood pay him taxes
Twenty percent of your block, he that nigga in all the maxes
We right off Exit 26B, B.Q.E.
F Train, Smith &amp; 9th, last stop on the G.G.
Last stop on the 61 bus, or the 77
The home of Klein and Jess, out here, it ain't no fucking heaven
Don't come out here to see a chick or to a party
If they ain't certified gangsta, it don't matter if you know somebody
It's thirty one buildings, nigga, shit is the bing
Have that thing when you get off the train, cuz you in Red Hook Houses

[Hell Razah]
We putting heaters to they face, and give 'em some sideburns
And got they shine on, now it be our turn
He just a clone from a sample of my sperm
These old rappers washed up and they got worms
That's my word, when that slider and served
I'm Babe Ruth in the booth, knock it out of the 'burbs
Have you heard? Razah and Bazz emerge
Counting euro's in Hamburgh, Germany dough
You too big, you get sent to the infarmary flow
You be the type that be calling C.O., I turn prisoners to G.G.O.
Tune in, wanna see my show? We be another bracket, straight jacket flow
Ya'll niggas better play more D, and get a point guard
I got plenty of bars, that will annoint ya'll
Head nodding with shame, and disappoint ya'll
I'm trying to turn these rhymes into a black card
You know power, respect, pussy and fast cars
Without loyalty, you ain't making it that far
They try to bury a star, inside a graveyard
But when I die on this earth, I'm out the universe

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Hell Razah]
Feel me? Raziel, youknowhatimsaying
Seraphim, T.H.U.G. Angelz
Wings up, this one, freestyle 101
Knowhatimsaying, you don't need no gun for ya'll niggas
Trouble your way...
Yeah, '08, ya'll got a problem
Start re-recording, freestyle, fee style
However you want it, youknowhatimsaying
Our credibility is good, what
Yo, we out of here, man, wings up, nigga</pre>
