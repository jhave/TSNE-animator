[INTRO]
Whatchu mean I don't need you no more?
Cause I don't!
I gotta bag full of toys and I don't need none of your boys
So you can hit every chick on the block
Cause I'm gone be alright once I turn this power on, ya dig?

[VERSE 1]
Toys!
You don't get the job done when I need a little loving
So I gotta do it myself if I wanna feel something
So I grab me a toy, 'lil boo ain't buggin'
Now I want some affection and you ain't giving me nothing

[CHORUS]
A toy, every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel
Every girl has a toy now, baby!
A toy, every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel (Uh, c'mon!)

[VERSE 2]
I keep my butterfly close when you ain't wanna be bothered
Don't come waking me up, cause I ain't giving you nada
Cause I got me a toy (Tooooy)
And it works for me and it lasts longer than the battery
So you best believe that

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 3]
I used to wish that you would love me
And fantasize on how we used to be
Until I discovered something better than you
I don't need, no need, your loving
You wanna come home late at night touchin' and feelin' all over me
But I don't need no help in pleasing me
Oh!

[CHORUS]

[OUTRO]
How could I miss you baby, I didn't even know you was gone
It's obvious you aren't needed in the bedroom anymore
I'm just keeping myself occupied like all women do when they are taking a bath
And when you leave, make sure you don't slam the door because you fuck up my concentration

Tooooy!</pre>
