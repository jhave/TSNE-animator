[Intro: Bizzy]
Preach (yeahhhhhhhhhhh)
Preach baby (ooh-yeahhhhh, yeahhhhhhh)
Rollin, smokin, chokin all dayyyyy (c'mon)
Rollin rollin rollin, yeah (let's get high pimp, woo!)
Rollin, smokin, chokin all dayyyyy
Smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke
Rollin rollin rollin, yeah...
Rollin, smokin, chokin all dayyyyy
C'mon, rollin rollin rollin, yeah
Give me some hydro

[Layzie Bone]
Flyin down 71, blowin big with the top down
Watchin out for the cops now, hopin that they don't come around
Man I love the summertime, everybody out, on the grind
I know they wanna hit this pine, these pretty girls is all super fine
Got that California sticky with me, 20 sacks, they goin for 50
I smoke one, they spinnin with me, other than that these fools convince me
I'm tipsy, and I'm high as hell, already done hit the kush
Everybody know I got 'dro for sale but I'm bustin dawg if they make a push
Exit down on 80 Road, I'm gettin hyped cause I'm gettin close
My niggaz is tired of carryin the load, so so, I'm finna let them smoke
Buster right at 110th, made a stop at Dupont
Finna head on over to Remington, to see what Buck and Scoop doin
Turn down the music light, who is that nigga y'all finna choke?
Pulled out a blunt and told him to jump in
Let's smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke...

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke
Rollin, smokin, chokin all dayyyyy
Smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke...
Rollin, smokin, chokin all dayyyyy
Give me some hydro
Rollin rollin rollin, yeah
Smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke

[Layzie Bone]
Well I'ma blaze this one for Thin C, in the spirit of Rick James
In the spirit of Biggie Smalls, he know how to +Spit That Game+
Talk that shit, walk that shit, grab that sack, roll that quick
Put it in the air, burn that shit, put it to your lips, take that hit
Puff-puff give, pass it on down, gotta make sure it come back around
Uh-oh nigga now what's that sound? Stomach growls, we hungry now
How many weed songs can one man make?
How many blunts to the face, can one man take?
Well let's roll, I wanna know
I wanna blow until we all P.O.
And we can wake up in the mornin, we can do it again
We might, run out of Swishas but we ain't gon' run out again
And if you do then let me lend somethin, my credit good, there's no frontin
Ain't comin for nothin, bottom line I'm on somethin, on somethin...

[Chorus]

[Bizzy] Smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke {*2X*}</pre>
