And I'm scuba-diving bitches till their clothes so tight
And if I'm on your joint you properly selected

Been a rapper, rap a hoe
But I will wrap you up, rap me though, oh
Never see me drinking cristal, oh
Only see me cuttin' ?, oh
Or drinkin' ? can of juice, Santana boots
See me in Atlanta with the bandana loose
Damn, niggaz still doubt my name

Back of the club with all my cuz, fly
In the plane, and this is the game, Pastor

[Ms. Jade]
What you talkin', I bring heat when it's hawkin'
Cause I can't stand a man that don't understand
I'm weighing kilos and grams, the bitch with the upper-hand
I'm bout to kill it, you dealin' with the realest
Fuck the strawberries and chocolate
Hennesy and a condom, say they kissin' and grindin'
It's all about the timin', I really like Vice Versa
But tonight's much worser, and um
Philly chick, you only travel with for best of men
Had me out Atlanta just to see you in your belt and Timb's
Pastor Troy won't you just pass the boy
In a split second I'm answerin' all questions
You dummy's are still confessin' how money make you undressin'
So tell me
