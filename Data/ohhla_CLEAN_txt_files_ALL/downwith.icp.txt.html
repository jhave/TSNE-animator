Down With The Clown

This one goes out to the ninjas
Thats been down since Carnival of Carnage
Nah, fuck that, since Dog Beats
Nah, fuck that, since Basement Cuts, motherfucker

[Violent J]
How long will the juggalos be down with me?
How long till they forget me, check it out
What if I grew another fucking head
And his name was Violent Ed
And he head butt me every time I cussed
I would need two microphones when I bust
Would you show me love even with another head
Or would you be like, "Fuck you and Ed"
Or what if I sold out like a bitch
And took the make-up off and went soft, eww
Called myself Detroit Southwest Lover
And put my ugly ass face on the album cover
With R &amp; B top ten hits
And we had Jodeci singing all over our shit (aaahhhh!!!!)
Fuck that, though, yo, I'm a juggalo
So don't forget me like you did with milenko

[Chorus (1x)]
What about when the world's like fuck us kill us, what will you be? (down)
What about when I'm 103, what will you be? (down, down)
What about when the world's like fuck us kill us, what will you be? (down)
What about when the carnival comes to your town? (i'm a be down with the
clown)

[Violent J]
How long will you be down with a ghetto puppet
I say I'm sick in the nugget and you love it
I ate a dead body, I ain't proud of it
I told you all about it, and you all applauded (HEY!!)
I got problems, I'm haunted by a carnival
I could run and tell a doctor, but what for
I just put it on tape with a fat beat
And make a quick buck, I'm like fuck
I could of came out sportin some Hammer pants
Kick-steppin with Shaggs, and tryin to dance
Making mom happy, keeping it soft
I'd rather grab my dick and tell your mom to fuck off!
I know then you'd probably start to trip
And swing at me, but hit Violent Ed in the lip
Look I don't even know what I'm trying to say
Just don't forget me like you did with ?????

[Chorus (1x)]

I'm a be down, I'm a be down
Down with the clown till I'm dead in the ground(13x)
