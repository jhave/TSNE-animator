It's still the same thang ain't nothing changed, me and my dogs trying to have thangs
Flipping our cheddar trying to maintain, don't wanna go to jail but trying to hit stangs
I'm a G sitting back peeping game, on the block where the niggaz might get ya mayn
4-4 slugs might hit ya frame, cause these niggaz still wanna go against the grain
Steady trying to ball, just not knowing they about to fall
Want the love but they hate em all, wanting God but they ain't made the call
Niggaz thinking they just too cool, fifteen years old dropped out of school
Trying to cap about what they do, drama come they better get that tool
They know death sitting round the corner, Lord knows they ain't ready for the reaper to come calling
They life falling ahead of time, and ain't trying to stall him
This right here is all that I see, T-R-A-E is all that I be
Same thang different day, gotta live your life by any means

[Hook - 2x]
It's the same thang, different day
Niggaz know, what I mean dog
It's the same thang, different day
Same thang, different day dog

Collect call from the county jail, Kick Dog caught up trying to make the mail
Third strike and ain't got no bail, inside it hurt like hell
Everyday this how the world turn, in the heat but don't wanna get burned
22-Agg' might make him learn, he going through it for a hell of a term
Baby mama ain't make it no better, she know that you gone and she searching for cheddar
You losing your mind and it's really whatever, all the pain is your permanent weather
Back put up against the wall, pride ain't gon let him give up at all
Built up pressure bout to let go, so his outlook on life is fuck em all
My advice is to slow it down, ain't no type of kin folk coming round
That shit ain't right you and I both know, your dog gon be the one to hold it down
And that's life whether real or fake, reality is what you can't shake
It be the same thing everyday, the weight of the world might make you break

[Hook - 2x]

A new day but the same drama, everybody still wanna prove theyself
Let me tell it to ya damn fool, headed off to go lose theyself
He got beef wit you know who, hot headed for the hood near you
Letting everybody pump up his brain, loading up to see what you do
Dog you don't wanna go out like that, slugs'll get ya where you can't fight back
It don't take much for you to know that, six shots and everybody gon scat
Where ya dogs where ya friends, you back alone once again
If it's meant to be you won't walk again, fucking with them same ol' niggaz again
I ain't going but I'm trying to show ya, everyday life is about to fold ya
Don't get caught up trying to be a soldier, you'll wind up dead when nobody know ya
That's the truth and it's simple and plain, don't let the devil get up in ya mayn
He'll have it when you gon lose your brain, in different ways but it's all the same

[Hook - 2x]

(*talking*)
Same thang different day, time roll by know I'm saying
Shit still don't change, it's always the same
Everyday reality, gotta take it for what it is you know I'm saying
Don't whine about the shit, just be smart about it
Don't be no fool, get caught up in the hype
Street life know I'm saying, that ain't shit to brag about
Some people, just stuck with that shit
My advice is get your grind on, do your thang
Do it on the low, you feel what I'm saying
Don't get caught up, fucking with these fake motherfuckers
Or your so-called friends, so-called gal
All that shit don't mean nothing, you know I'm saying keep God first</pre>
