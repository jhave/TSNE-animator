Song:   Further Down the Road
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Half a mile outside Buloxi
Did I come or did I go
Seven sirens singin' to me
Why I listen I don't know
I got some smokes I got some coffee
My head is ready to explode
I'll be makin' my way further down the road

I'm not much for conversation
And I don't care for playin' games
I've heard all the hard luck stories
Man they all turn out the same
I'm the last lonely survivor
And I'm still carryin' their load
I'll be makin my way further down the road

I'll be makin' my way
I wanna get there some day
I'll be makin' my way
Past the one eyed Jocks layin' rail road tracks in my soul

I'll be makin' my way
I wanna get there some day
I'll be makin' my way
Past the one eyed Jacks layin' rail road tacks in my soul

Sometimes I wake up with a fever
Then I just have another beer
I'd like to wake up to a new life
A million miles away from here
But I got Beam instead me chasin'
And I live by the legend's code
I'll be makin' my way further down the road
I'll be makin' my way further down the road</pre>
