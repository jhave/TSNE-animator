[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
You know where I come from, (Know where I'm from)
(It's that boy) Shaolin baby

[Inspectah Deck]
Yes this shit is raw comin at your door
Ya start to scream out loud Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hours four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights and plus the cold war
Everybody face down on the floor before Hell break loose
Like Tom Hanks rushin the shore
Brother man stay bout it for sure
Big blades on the Escalade, Gettin paid bouncin on the law
It's only just a matter of time
I'ma flat line your vital signs when I rat-a-tat with the rhyme
Don't nah nigga do it like me, White tee matchin Nikes
The blue and white fifty-nine fifty
I watch the city like my name's Bruce Wayne
Counted loose change on a stoup hangin where my crew bang
Certified live, Duckin the five
With two pipes like Wes Snipes bustin from the side
So serious like the Gods in Medina
Street sweeper buck shots, The quake off the rictor
Gotta have it, Brother Osh popped the 'matic
Supreme team, Bags and beams, Rockin carrots
Can't nobody stop my grind, Bottom line
If it's on I'll put a fool in a box for mine
And I'm only gonna warn you once
Chew on this, Food for thought, Smash all your fronts
And I'ma eat yall frauds for lunch
Chump ass niggas ball for stunts, We fuck broads in a bunch
You aint gangst, Son your soft, It's evident
For my thugs doin life I'm forced to represent
Watch the V12 sit on chrome
The same love I get outta town watch I get at home
Left shorty back blown when she hit that dome
It's like that when I get that jones, When I'm in that zone
This is for the die hard who ride hard
In every zip code switchin fresh cloths and fly cars

[Hook]
