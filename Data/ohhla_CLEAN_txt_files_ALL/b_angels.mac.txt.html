[Killah Priest]
Life and death is like a carnival to cemeteries
Ain't nobody left that's honorable, they all been buried
The chronicles of the projects, the Gods wore heavy
Chains, his name reign over ghetto terrains
The dope fiends worship, he respected by Killah
The realest over everyone, kept reflectable trigger
Niggas laugh till they cry fallin' from shots
Hollerin' crackheads, someone's callin' the cops
Hold up, let me let y'all niggas know one thing
I'm Ghetto Jezuz of the hood, be where guns ring
When I dream, I see war planes and submachines
Judges poke the pitchfork at thugs wit wings

(Hook) Razah, Timbo King 2x
Look deep into my eyes, can you see my soul?
Man fell from heaven to this one hell hole
From this hell, we excel and we rise again
Look deep into my eyes again, Black Angels

[Hell Razah]
Dear Lord come save us sinners
Slaves that was made to kill us
Young lions and gorillas in this jungle of dealers
In this hell where you buy you sell
You sell your buyers
We Jeremiah prophecy - Maccabee Riders
Heavenly riders, Satan wants the spirit inside us
Waitin' to try us, innocent faces and liars
Judas' seed, sex, death, music and weed
The beauty of Eve, it's all above, soon to be grieved
Capture souls get left wit their casket closed
While the poor in the streets yellin' "Free Daddy Rose"
Project shootouts, dice game bank root out
Some pronounced dead befo they move out
What you about, shootin' or tellin'?
It's heaven for a felon, age 11 playin' wit weapons
Raised off old 70's records by coke
Chemist's use credit, that dope epidemic
The more money that's not made; the more blood to shed it
They buy weight and sell it, straight cash, no credit
Stolen dirt-bikes on the turnpipe, stolen merchandise
Dropped off, knocked off fast for higher price
Last night made a killin'
Heard shots up in my building
In the midst fuckin' this chick
Son I was filmin', thought I was filmin'

(Hook) Razah 2x

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Ayo I been thru a lot, the game tortured me
These flames be scorchin' me
Allah's hands be stretchin' forth for me
Sometimes I feel heavenly Father be divorcin' me
My life is like a Biblical novel, y'all ain't a fore for me
The perils of my penance almost got me a life sentence
Fatal syringe piercin' the veins of sinners
Playin' roulette in this game wit Ds and barrel spinners
Poison snow flake on a scale wit 'Five Percenters'
Stripped of our halo and wings, evil got in us
Mad guns and heavy weight, money machine to print us
I ran the streets wit them killers and squealer gators
Guerrillas dodgin' NARC's, seagulls, sharks and counterfeiters
Talk out the side of ya mouth
The slugs will fly right out the side of ya mouth
And everybody's gettin' tired of ya somehow
The gats snuff 'em, we cuff 'em and duck tape 'em
If y'all ain't meet our ransom demands then we rape 'em
We neva gave flyin' fuck, whether you sold or snort
The Judge told niggas don't eva show their face in this court
You come up short or you bounce me the ball
You get hit up in broad daylight in front of ya moms
That real gangsta shit, neva showin' faces in flicks
Pop witnesses to get them cases dismissed
Go to ya wake wit a gun and flowers
Kiss ya moms and sign ya obituary if you hit one of ours
Call me an animal, man, the streets raised me
Somebody must of prayed for me cuz God saved me</pre>
