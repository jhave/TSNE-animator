[Chorus 2X: OJ Da Juiceman]
Said we walkin on ice with our wrists like BRRR
And our chain like AYE, and our diamonds like OKAY
And our cars be super fast, and we smokin up that gans
Twista, Juiceman, Gucci Mane, we get that cash
(Young Juice!)

[Twista]
Now when I spit it for the niggaz and the bitches 
I be comin with a flow and it be so, bizarre (yup)
Kick ass like Bruce Lee, cause I got diamonds like "WA-TAH!"
And the kush is like "WA-TAH!" And the cars is like "OOOOH"
My sound effects make 'em say "You's a motherfuckin fool"
You can tell from the streets I got love and I'm fresh and you can't take it
You could tell from the neck I'm plugged, yes I'm in the +Matrix+
OJ and Gucci, please tell me who the nigga right there that be seen wit'cha
Named after the car so call me Pearl Tangerine Twista
If she is my cheeba then she is my fiancée (fiancée)
My nina's a diva so I call her Beyoncé (Beyoncé)
My chain got me leanin so I call it my Bombay (Bombay)
And my, watch is conceited so I call it a Kanye (Kanye)

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I'm smokin on that ganja like a Rasta
Jewelry's sick, my jeweler need a doctor
You're not my type of hype, girl you look like a monster
Head game lame, Gucci Mane'll flunk ya
Candy ice game, thuggin since a youngster
Candy watch game, watch like Willy Wonka
Don't make me tell my nigga Wooh to trunk ya
Or Waka Flocka Flame to double pump ya
Comma comma comma, boy go run ya banks up
Me and Juiceman, let's go buy some more stuff
Fuck a broad man, we down to put the house up
Put your hood up, then step ya game up

[Chorus]

[OJ Da Juiceman]
Alaska and Atlanta, fo' rings shawty
Three chains swang, D-U-B's on my charger
Yes, I'm a stunner, and I'm doin numbers
Right wrist nasty, left wrist dumber
I stunt the whole hun'ned on a necklace and a Hummer
Ballin like a NBA star with them commas
Chain like Karate Kid kickin white diamonds
Wax on, wax off, damn my diamonds shinin
Pull up in that gray thang, 28 Asanti's
Fo' pockets full cause Juiceman get that money
Six cell phones, two trap spots bunky
Young Juiceman blowin pounds of that funky

[Chorus]</pre>
