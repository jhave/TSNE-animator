[Intro: Twista]
Yeah, y'all ready to ball, are y'all really ready to ball?
It's the Twista, EA Sports 2004, NBA Live
And you know how it go down, check it

[Chorus: Twista]
You think you're too cold but I
Think you need to go and grab
Your favorite squad
Put your warm up suit on
Cause we about to get our hoop on

[Verse 1: Twista]
In this game ain't nobody colder
When I post to Pippen and I be picking with the cross over, two times over
When I'm floating over your shoulder
I'm the reason why you sounding like a lost soldier
But I'm alright
Representing, I'll be hooping with the Knicks all night
Rather be producing with Houston
And running with Spree
And plus, thinking that Antonio McDyess
He's so nice with the peel
I'm a stay fly when I kick it and switch it to A.I. in Phillyville
Miss it and we right and he will
And he got no skills and it be a guarantee that he go grill
And win everytime
Brother got to get with Kobe
Especially if the game is on my mind
Shaq up in the paint
With Fisher and Horry dropping treys
And Devean George hurting them all the time
Got them crying like a baby
Minnesota got them fast Mercedes, I put them asleep with big K.G
If I got the Sacramento Kings, or Mike Bibby
It will be impossible for you to fade me
I play the game, fully in control
Hit me with some three's and I'm a take it to the hole
EA Sports 2004, NBA Live, if you didn't, now you know
But I know

[Chorus: Twista] - (2X)</pre>
