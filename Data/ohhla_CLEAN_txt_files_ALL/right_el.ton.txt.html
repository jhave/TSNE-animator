[Verse 1]
Pop your corks if you're a champaign socialist
Open up a sweat shop, let's make the most of this
Ridiculous, conspicuous society we got
Where tax never touches those living at the top
Where a track like this - won't ever get a shot at the pop charts
I wanna punch on with rockstars
Fuck a film clip with big tits and hot cars
My gimmick is my lyrics are likely to stop hearts
It's not hard, to show some humanity
Or get a rocket launcher and aim the thing at Channel V
Ha! I'm flipping my lid!
Can't believe Pegz ain't platinum - and Pete Murray is
Feel it in your guts like a hit to the ribs
As you listen to that television fib to your kids
When the fuel runs out - the fools rush in
The end of the beginning, the beginning of the end!

[Chorus]
I'm a one shot kill like heroin, experiments
Are bound to blow up - if you add the right element
And real skills is the medicine
When MCs do anything to get played then don't say anything
A one shot kill like heroin, experiments
Are bound to blow up - if you add the right element
And my message is the medicine
When MCs do anything to get played then don't say anything

[Verse 2]
I was born in '84
And us kids this world was made for
Have done nothing but get high and piss on the decor
We got a core that's as hard as an acorn
We need support so many new laws to take on
Cos everyday we're told to "get our invade on"
Afghanistan, Iraq, so many people to hate on
I reckon that don't make sense for five seconds
Can you hate a poor family if you never even met em'?
Can't we ask for peace before armaggedon?
Arn't we forgetting the first commandment?
Arn't we setting fire to the very thing we need most?
With no love there's no hope that's no joke
I got the jump on this game real quick so I could get up on your radio and
say real shit
It ain't all my pain but it's what I see
And what I feel
So I guess now that's who I be..

[Chorus]
I'm a one shot kill like heroin, experiments
Are bound to blow up - if you add the right element
And real skills is the medicine
When MCs do anything to get played then don't say anything
A one shot kill like heroin, experiments
Are bound to blow up - if you add the right element
And my message is the medicine
When MCs do anything to get played then don't say anything
(I got something to show you but you may not want to see it
I got something to tell you but, you may not believe it
Even though you might feel wide awake - to me it looks like you're dreaming
I can't get to sleep from the screams outside - how can everybody be dreaming?)

[Verse 3]
I maintain the right to bust
We all gotta say our piece before we bite the dust
So many wrongs in a system that ain't right for us
We gotta fight for them but they won't fight for us
Na, that makes no sense, so I make no apologies
About declaring war on war-like ideologies
Except my invasion will go better than theirs did
A new world mind-state embedded in their kids
In all fairness justice is the rarest commodity we got left - I'm spreading
awareness
They walk free despite how much evidence there is
You don't care but that doesn't mean you should be careless
We made the mess party people - we should clean it up
2000 and 7 year bender - we should be easing up
Tomorrow morning it's a brand new day
Take a second look and see it in a brand new way

[Chorus]
I'm a one shot kill like heroin, experiments
Are bound to blow up - if you add the right element
And real skills is the medicine
When MCs do anything to get played then don't say anything
A a one shot kill like heroin, experiments
Are bound to blow up - if you add the right element
And my message is the medicine
When MCs do anything to get played then don't say anything
(I got something to show you but you may not want to see it
I got something to tell you but, you may not believe it
Even though you might feel wide awake - to me it looks like you're dreaming
I can't get to sleep from the screams outside - how can everybody be dreaming?)</pre>
