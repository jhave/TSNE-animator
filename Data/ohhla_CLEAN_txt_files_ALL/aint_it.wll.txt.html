Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ain't it pretty when she walk {*2X*}
Ain't it pretty when she talk {*2X*}
Ain't it sexy when she move
She's so sexy when she move
It's so lovely when she do
When she do the things she do-ooo {*3X*}

Its lovely, oh its lovely {*2X*}

[Verse 1]
Girl look good when she sit
Down at the bustop lickin on her lips
I seen a lot of chicks
I gotta admit
But You the baddest girl that I seen in a minute
You got nice eyes
Real nice lips
Got a pretty face
Tig ol' bits
I just wanna pay you some compliments
Please don't think that im tryna get in it
But baby if you wanna gimme a lil something
Here go my number girl call me if you
Wanna get to know eachother better if you dont that's cool
I just had to come and compliment you
Had to let you know you had a beautiful view
Your front says UH
Your back says OOH
Theres a million things I can think to do
But right now I just want to watch you, just watch you, watch you

Ain't it pretty when she walk {*2X*}
Ain't it pretty when she talk {*2X*}
Ain't it sexy when she move
She's so sexy when she move
It's so lovely when she do
When she do the things she do-ooo {*5X*}

Its lovely, oh its lovely {*2X*}

[Verse 2]
Your just gorgeous so beautiful
When God made you, he made you slow
He took his little time, plus you were the halo
One of a kind you the star of the show
Girl you shine, every door you glow
You so fine and I know that you know
You prolly get mobbed everywhere that you go
You need a body guard cus your body like WHOA
Walk down the blvd, boys like WHOA
Walk down the courtyard, boys like WHOA
If you want a best friend girl let me know
If you want a boyfriend here I go

I love you, I love you, I love you...

Ain't it pretty when she walk {*2X*}
Ain't it pretty when she talk {*2X*}
Ain't it sexy when she move
She's so sexy when she move
It's so lovely when she do
When she do the things she do-ooo {*3X*}

Its lovely, oh its lovely {*repeat until song ends*}</pre>
