Typed by: slimfast@chem.demon.co.uk

Yo, ever since Jimmy Crack Con 
Rockin' on ever since the day I was born 
Yes we get busy whenever we have to perform 
Shaking your tooshie making your pussy get warm 
Ha ha ha until all you niggas is gone 
I be hittin' until the morning got you callin' my storm 
Bounce my niggas, bounce my bitches (Bounce baby!) 
With the shit that do really have all you niggas going crazy 
Suffer from headrushes while niggas be smoking dutches 
Bitches be gettin' all in and they rippin' they pants crutches 
Wiggle they belly buttons 
Ay, wait a minute I wanna get all in it 
Long as my shorty with it 
You know I'm comin' to get it 
Doin' it to you makin' you really wonder who said it 
Swelling your melon while you yellin' 
Now check out the credit 
Giving it to you makin' you gimme back more 
(Coming through too!) 
Yes and we be kickin' down your door 
Keepin' it raw my nigga 
  
Chorus: 
All my bitches right in the front sayin' "Aahh" 
All my bitches way in the rear sayin' "Aahh" 
Party is goin' on over here (Say what?) 
Party is goin' on over here (Say what?) 
All my niggas right in the front sayin' "Ho!" 
All my niggas right in the rear sayin' "Ho!" 
The party is goin' on over here (Say what?) 
Party is goin' on over here (Say what?) 
All my people up in the place sayin' "Ho!" 
  
Let me just hear you some more 
Tell me what you lookin' for 
Told all of y'all already I ain't gonna tell you no more 
Hittin' you off makin' you niggas blast off! 
With some shit that'll be tearing your ass off 
Keppin' it comin', keepin' it movin', keepin' you wylin' 
We gettin' this paper let's keep the cheddar stacking and piling 
And now we happy and smiling cause now we living good 
Doin' it is how we be movin' it in the hood 
Wishing you could fuck around with me and my niggas 
How we double and wyle 
And double our bitches double our figures 
Turnin' you out 
Run from my niggas (No doubt!) 
Keepin' it blazing make all my bitches all shout 
Then I hit with the new make you take off your see-through 
While you peekin' around the corner baby I see you! 
Tell me what you gon' do 
I'm sayin' now I'm gon' have you wylin' until your ass drop 
Hit me off, yes now let me take it to the top 
We never stop my nigga 
  
Chorus: 
All my bitches up in the front sayin' "Aahh" 
All my bitches up in the rear sayin' "Aahh" 
Party is goin' on over here (Say what?) 
Party is goin' on over here (Say what?) 
All my niggas up in the front sayin' "Ho!" 
All my niggas up in the rear sayin' "Ho!" 
The party is goin' on over here (Say what?) 
Party is goin' on over here (Say what?) 
All my people up in the place sayin' "Ho!" </pre>
