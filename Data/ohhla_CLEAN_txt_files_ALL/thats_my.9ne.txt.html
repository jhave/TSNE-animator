Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
If my kid has a problem
It's up to me as the guardian to go and solve em'
Make my life and involve em
Late at night when I call em
I like to hear em' say daddy your song is awesome
Instead of gangbangers in school won't let up
I'm fed up I'm wondering if you can come up an red up
You shut up, negativity can be found inside my angels
Even though I was stupid but I put it down
Set trippin' - But I let it go headed for energetic flow
When I'm up to know that I was down and out
But now I'm breaded though
I know you saw me rep colors when I was young, dumb and malicious
I'm thankful, that all my blemishes never made you suspicious
Latched on to light
That's known to hype apparent you coherent knowing I rapped wrong to right (write)
Love and positivity instilled in my kid
Their family my family their mother and I did
Discipline starts at home even if they can't stand you
Watch em' fights land, you clock em' right hand
To stop em' that a man to stand up even add a camera
They won't be James Holmes, and they won't be Adam Lanza
A John Malvo, I'll flow loud for my child though
Ain't raising no groucho evil out my house yo
Instead a me watching em' disappear in the night
Air em' at graduation saying that's my kid right there

[Chorus: Cee Lo Green]
I proudly claim my love
The futures born from my own flesh and blood
All that matters, this time
So prayers that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
To my unborn I give my all so you could ball like I could
Stay in school and play it smooth and do those things that I wouldn't
Pay attention and keep your distance from ignorant instances
Play a instrument anything that you want just invision it
Follow your dreams, no matter what may come or what may fall
Cause' ain't no shame in failing as long as you know you gave your all
Staned up, man up, get a handle on yourself tighten your belt
Do what you can to do for you and ya'll just don't, do it for the wealth that they offer
It sounds awful but if me and your mama' ain't talking
And she said that I ain't offering a call just as often as I should
I pray that you get older and you understand that I was just, doing what I could
If she let me, if you have a second I could explain
Like so many transitions in life that people change
Whether I'm on top soil, or dead in a box
I love you dearly sincerely and that'll never stop
For my kid..
For my kid..

[Chorus: Cee Lo Green]

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Paris and Darius Dariana Unique Oshay Malik
And one on the way in a matter of weeks
But it's a shame cause' I think that my other daughter ain't mine
Andria baby I love you I guess your father was blind
In due time you'll understand it, how your mama' was scandelous
(Wait this don't seem right man, I don't think I can handle it,)
When I all I ever did was show love for you
Sweated blood for you, any moment take a slug for you
But it's cool, the baby mama drama is expected
And that karma is going to be what I been blessed with
Sit back and learn your lessons as our seeds grow from kids to adolescence
Then present you for yourself as misdirection
The first to heed the message is Malik
Abandonded by his mama' on thanksgiving evening
Bout' three years ago was up to me to feed to em morals
Values manhood, knowledge a week ago he graduated
You ask me, then I'm a' say

[Chorus: Cee Lo Green]</pre>
