Typed by: Youngbloodz16@aol.com

Mack playas, ballas, grindas.
Yeah I'm the real true pimp of the year.
Will ya feel me.
Ha ha, pimp of the mutha' fuckin' year.

Give it up give it up a give it to me.
A big mack capalized double D. see. 
And it's on, so I'm a get sick wit it, 
A give me drank da bomb and let me get wit it.
Yeeyah, cause I'm gonna be the biggest pimp of the year 
Goin' around doin' shit like this here. 
Cause a nigga is strong, 
And way to long when it comes to my ding dong. 
But, bet, I get a check when I sign on the dotted line, 
So now I know I gotta get mine. 
It's really no thang to me, see, to be a real true P.I.M.P.
Cause I had me a hoe or two or mo' 
Way back in eighty fuckin' fo'. 
That's when I was a teen. 
But my dick was still big to make a bitch bleed, see.
And of coarse I'm slappin' hoes, 
smackin' hoes, up and down tha fuckin' avenues. 
And ever I do that,
I dig a deep in the pocket for tha fat gat.
Feel me. I'm so god damn bad, 
That I had to kick off in a hoe's ass, 
Cause the girl tried to do me, 
Ride of with her man in the mustang pony. 
And I know it'd catch up with her
Next day in the paper, yeah the nigga raped her. 
But I'm not trippin'. 
Bitches like you wanna keep on slippin'. 
So I had to move on, to the next young bitch that had it goin' on
Ugh, and I'm not here to pump no fear,
I'm just the mack playa' pimp of the year, bitch.

Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies.
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies.

First thang first on the second verse. 
I learned a hell of a lot, 
A get from the get down start. 
So I had my hoes hoin'. 
Had every tramp thinkin' I was the orthidano goin'. 
Cause all the game I spit is good shit, 
And the shit that I spit made me rich. 
Cause I was all about money. 
If the girl says she down, well bees come and get the honey. 
Cause I'm givin' it up quick. 
Take a hit, take a lick at them pink lips. 
Uh, and a bet is better than grey, 
Not knowin' that I bought this broad out of state
And I met her in Mentley . 
Lookin' just like the actress singer Whitney. 
But I knew she was a fake one, 
But to me young bra' it didn't really make me none. 
I just walked up to her. 
I said my name's Dru Down and I'll Slick Rick the ruler.
And from the get go,
I'm just a pimp, hoe, ya comin' with me, a to the east side O
And then she said okay,
I'm on my way, let me pack my bags before today.
Yeeyah, then I said get with it and don't be a bitch and try to split
Uh, She was right up under my wing ,
At the airport at five fifteen. 
She said "Who are you and why are ya here?",
I said I'm Dru Down and pimp of the year. 

Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies.
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies.

I've got a thang for makin' hoes.
Every woman that I touch bitch turns into gold.
And I don't go for talk back, 
Have respect when ya speakin' to a pimp fuck that.
Deduct from tha pay check, 
Matta fact get yo ass in the back of the Cadillac,
So I can ride and check mate.
Like rule number eight I keep a bitch in a plate. 
And no I don't play around, fuck around, 
A when it comes to my money nigga. 
And when it comes to gettin' a bitch sprung, 
I give her Henesee, a with tha one on one. 
So she can get so high, real high, 
And that she that knows I'm that type a guy. 
Cause I'm a kick somethin' just for the hoes, 
And for myself I keep indo. 
And when a hoe finds out I'm real, yes I am
Mack playa pimp of tha year.

Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies.
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies.
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies.
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies. </pre>
