Yeah
Mmmm

Echoes in the halls yes, when I arrive on the set - what?
Blessin all that came to see me rock my cut
Such a man like me receivin attention must be chosen
like a bangin body chickenhead, posin for a flick
Flashbulbs poppin in the air
Floatin the stage, I'm movin like a black Fred Astaire - smooth
The momentum of the bass and treble, levels on point
Bonus to ride, the microphone
it's O.C. slash, Mush shine communicatin for the masses
Puttin my finger against NASA
When I die, bronze my mic, preserve it for newcomers
to visit my gravesite like a shrine
Rappers'll line up faithfully, just to get
a handful of dirt from the plot occupied by

Chorus:

The Chosen One, beyond the Moet and the Cristal
The Son of a King and a Queen, I'm a gifted child
All bow to me like the image of God, Supreme Being
Get you to the eyes worth seeing

Influenced; but not by the ancient ruins of rap
A large percent of y'all fell into a trap
Trendsetter share with y'all a veteran's nightmare
Not for you to follow it but try and stand clear, bust it
Bein intelligent, means you a sucka
Bein wild as hell, means you a smart motherfucker WRONG

Most rappers gunsprayed or hustled from night to day - fiction
I deciphered lots of rhymes, only to find
false info, just to see what it meant to Oh
Not for-real; no skill MC's
Mostly all under twenty, and I find it funny
That's why the seed was born to lead assume
positions like Noah, all aboard the arc with

Chorus: repeat 2X

I'm comin from an Egyptian Mola story, rarely told
Back in the mix of things to break the mold
Good as gold mind ya leave negative thoughts behind ya
Type of how I'm livin be more potency than ganja
Oh Period; when you see my face I'm serious
Move with the mystique of a cheetah, mysterious
Dominate jungles when I walk the floor rumbles
The baddest motherfuckers - I make their attitudes humble
My aura shine bright like sunlight, in Farenheight temperature
Stylee's, you file these
Most is type of scriptures, follow me is for reference
Other MC's make no kind of sense
Oh freeze foes and bleed souls and leave those stunned
Descended on the planet, you're in confusion
Pick ten, subtract five then, subtract four
Watch the Sun leave a shadow on the man that's raw
I be

Chorus: repeat 2X
