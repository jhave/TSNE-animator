Special dedication from the D.P.G.C.
To all the homies locked down
Hope that we could be together soon
On some real talk
We used to do it big out here, my nig
You should see how we doin' it out here now
Check it out...

[Daz]
It's been eighteen years since I seen you on the streets
You're up for parole heard the word this week
My cousin Flip comin' home damn it's been so long
Keep ya eyes on the prize, homie keep ya head strong
Sendin' ya packages, kites keep you straight
Keepin' this commissary fat 'til the take(?)
So we can chop it up, so we can spread the icin'
Enticing OG's fo' surely, you know I like it
This is a D.P.G. dedication
It's for my homies on parole or probation
And you can catch a case homie on vacation
It's for the radio, so ya'll just bang it

[Snoop]
To my young homeboy, who ain't never gettin' out
Here's a record for you homie, 'cause I know you got clout
One love, Eastside, that's how we do right
D.P.G.C. we do or die
Oh yes we fresh to death, nonetheless
When we was out, we was rockin' Guess
But guess what?, now we rockin' Snoop Dogg clothin'
And every nigga in the click straight rollin'

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Hope that, we can be, be together real soon...
I hope that, we can be, be together real soon
Real soon...

[Kurupt]
Just a little bit of game ain't a damn thang
Let the heater rang, bang, Dogg Pound gang swang
Ride wit me, let me show ya how the D.P do
G.C. Dat Nigga Daz, Kurupt, Nate, Snoop
The homies might flash
Kick back, send about five of 'em past
All I wanna do is D.P.G.
And keep it like that and hit donuts in the streets
Ridin' by, gettin' high, do that one-two step
Make the whole spot stop, then hit the vogue(?) next
Me and Daz ridin' side by side
Nate and Snoop ridin', one in front, one behind.

[Snoop]
To my young homeboy, who ain't never gettin' out
Here's a record for you homie, 'cause I know you got clout
One love, Eastside, that's how we do right
D.P.G.C. we do or die
Oh yes we fresh to death, nonetheless
When we was out, we was rockin' Guess
But guess what?, now we rockin' Snoop Dogg clothin'
And every nigga in the click straight rollin'

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
Nigga out up on the streets tryin' to come on up
Got caught slippin', and got caught the hell up
Just tryin' to make some money wit my rhymes
Cheddar for my baby, then live right
Got me a room and a couple of rocks
Raised on the streets, yes, the school of hard knocks
Nigga betta pay me, ready or not
Findin' dead bodies all on your block
Nigga gotta get paid, and that's on the real
Broke on the smoke, then you know how I feel
I miss the real gangsta's, and that's on the real
Got locked up while chasin' the scrill...

[Snoop]
To my young homeboy, who ain't never gettin' out
Here's a record for you homie, 'cause I know you got clout
One love, eastside, that's how we do right
D.P.G.C. we do or die
Oh yes we fresh to death, nonetheless
We was out, we was rockin' Guess
But guess what?, now we rockin' Snoop Dogg clothin'
And every nigga in the click straight rollin'

[Chorus]</pre>
