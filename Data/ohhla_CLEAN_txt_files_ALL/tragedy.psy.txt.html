You're online type in a password from your own mind 
What you think is top secret got insiders thinking they're all mine 
Y2K year two thousand is when they go blind 
Shut down machines scrambling while media co-signs 
Predesigned programs that kill technology romance 
Set up for chaos make you and destiny slow dance 
So the storm lands microchip in your wrist and they'll insist 
That this will make life easier troubleless 
Hassle-free but actually none of this is for the best 
Interest or the progress of society, buying me? 
You can call me paranoid but paranoia's a defense mechanism 
From those trying to destroy ya 
Don't let them throw ya off course 
Keep that money safe buried in your backyard 
And beware of the pale horse 
  
These tragic scenes unfold and cause panic 
Organized crime families control automatically 
Computer chip slanging to new age fanatics 
Stuck to your PC screens like addicts 
Madness and online freedom bandits 
Create you a World Wide Web of sadness 
This sick plan to assist the removal of democracy 
Won't miss 
  
We're caught in webs of mind control screens 
And through world wide revolt you find tragedy 
We fight the scenes 
Enemies and computer chip slavery tragedy 
  
Computer components are considered Demonic Masonic 
Made by the enlightened opponent they own it 
They control it flood the market target the dormant 
Claiming that they simplify but really complicate the moment 
In a glance we think hollow follow the prize 
Swallow the shallow lies strive where we wallow 
Computer age stage millenium plague vague but certain 
Open the curtain digital burden 
  
Strangers link to you bring danger 
Red sky signs of the weather 
Being controlled a world wide light show 
And they know the commands for rain, wind, snow 
Codes punched in produce storms 
And can't be stopped with the use of fire arms 
Anti-government groups get shot 
And we slide into the age of robot 
Cops enforce world orders and bring static 
And civilians and the uniformed go at it 
Wild fights ignite in the middle of the night 
Into the daylight 
Reported acts to enslave on track 
And we push our hack platoon to get started 
Terrorists through e-mail drop bombs
