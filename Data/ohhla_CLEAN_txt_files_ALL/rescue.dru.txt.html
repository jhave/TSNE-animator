(Yukmouth)
Walkin down the street watchin ladies
All nighy watchin me was the housing authority, task, and OPD
It's rainin it's porin, do it 2-4 no snorin
Posted on the spot with the glock cuz we warrant
I'm soarin to the top of the deck
Ace in the hole on the grind gigity grind no time fo chasin hoes
Dope fiends love me, come to the spot pushin a buggy filled with kids
"Who got that cola man can you plug me?"
The slugs be on fat but was that a Cadillac
I'm not gun proof some nigga out the sunroof bustin caps
I'm strikin to the bushes but didn't quite make it
They thought it, brakin and takin my shit without my grip I'm naked
I hate it, got smacked across the face wit a sawed off
They roped me up choked me up now I'm hauled off
Wit pumpkin head locked in the trunk
I'm havin flashbacks cuz all I heard was glass packs and hella bump

they wanna have my ass hauled off
until my heads a sawed off 
and that bitch wit AIDS is takin her drawers off
call off scratch cuz they fuedin for the bundle, 
what's tryin to swundle
what fo we shit no mumbo jumbo
the dumb hoe was trippin so I might not have to dick the cock
cuz the clique suppose break her off the 50 rock
and she knows that I know that you know
it's like a big ass drought in the O, so fuck that hoe
they really tryin ta pump fear and shit
got that bitch lookin like Ethiopian of the year and shit
I straight escaped cuz they straight got funk
I'm in the front drawing down on each other wit mosberg pumps
I socked the bitch then tied her up, they left the glock in here
Can't do shit wit it cuz they left a nigga locked in here

(Dru) jump out the window

(Yukmouth)
man if I do it's my doom, I'm at the tribune
12 stories up in a vacant room
so what the fuck is up, they commin up wit some more niggas
I'm at the door about to go trigga
Happy, my nigga back me
On the quick fast in a hurry like snappy before they cap me
Don't trip cuz I got 4 clips and a grenade
But bring some more shit because they might be hard to fade

(Dru) Neva, I'm comin for yo ass wit the triggas
      I'd neva leave ya hangin on the crucifix my nigga
(Yuk) ay ay ay I gotta go man

(Dru Down)
ay hold on man, God damn
It seems that people always wanna test my real folks
And end up getting smiznoked
I'm finally startin to get sick like Jason
No patience, I needa save my folks he's in the waitin
Probably spooked on the funk wit no parachute
He's willin to jump off the top of the tribune
But no need fo that we commin up elevator strapped bazooka on my back
I'm lyin on the floor prepared for caps
Dru Down, the elevator opens I'm so high
We're lightin up the place like the 4th of july
I yelled Yuk where ya at Yuk where ya at
He came runnin wit the gat and said them niggas dead in the back
I said where da hoe go niggaroe
He said I killed the bitch first for tryin to jump on my bone BITCH
And everything is alright
I know your nervous so let me put bud in a pipe right
And lets get into some more shit, some deep shit
Lets burn the dead niggas and the dead bitch
Cuz I could give a fuck less to what happens now
I'm ready to burn the whole muthafuckin buildin down
But I'm not goin out I'm jettin from the murda scene
So yuk either grab the zooka or the m-16
Because my arms is getting tired from weight
I wanna get back to the spot and smoke some dank
Check it out we hopped into the big block chevy
And if somebody ran up oh we was ready
But for a souvenir I cut off tongues
Ridin off safe on the freeway to some hoes house that's sprung
