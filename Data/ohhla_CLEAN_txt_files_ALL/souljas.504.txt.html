"Anyone contesting Tha Dogg Pound, guaranteed instant death" -&gt; RBX

[Snoop Dogg]
It's them Dogg House niggas wit' them 504 Boyz
We the real McCoys with the plastic toys
Pop, pop
Grab the glock, cock the motherfucker
No Limit niggas, we can't be stopped
Did you hear me?
Ya heard me
Record breakin'
Hit makin'
Can't bake 'em
Real estatin'
Never hatin'
Shakin' up the game, bringin' the major pain
Yea nigga, we all in the same game
We enlighten, ignitin, never fightin'
And we got them motherfuckers bitin'
You fuck wit' P, you fuckin' wit' me
You fuck wit Silkk, you fuckin' wit' me
You fuck wit' D, you fuckin' wit' me
Nigga what, that's my whole family

chorus 2x [Krazy]
What, you bitches goin' to war now (war now)
No Limit got this rap shit on lockdown (lockdown)
Wild out, bitch niggas when we come through (come through)
I hope you wear a vest, souljas touchin' you (touchin' you)
I'm bustin' you

[Master P]
I'm on the run, I head west wit' the dogs
504, that means ball til' u fall
I ain't bout' no playin' nigga, it's on and poppin'
You either workin' wit' those boys, or you out ther shortstoppin'
Now keep you eyes on the prize nigga, don't fuck wit' the hos
Cuz you see at night in the bricks nigga, anything goes
Now you can bulletproof you chest, and they'll bust your head
NIgga you scared to pop, then you could get an early grave
Cuz, one time don't worry me
I'm a third ward nigga til' they bury me (hahaa)
Two times nigga, shut it down
It's No Limit, we it on lock wit' the pound

chorus 2X

[Krazy]
Fresh out the courthouse, fuck the world, I'm finally free
Ask them bitch niggas who snitch, is they ready for me
My proverbs to the tank, believe I love it
Since that "Bout' It Bout' It" album, I was dreamin' of it
Ride wit' me, through the south, as I cruise through Texas
A young soldier, wit' about a hundred grand in my Lexus
On my way from Houston, after I scored the coke
I rather, step to jail than my family be broke
But I owe five hours, I can barely breathe
Please lord forgive me for my sins, I got kids to feed
Ain't no nigga in the Iberville givin' me shit
They went from trick to a bitch and buy that ho a fit
But my souljas, before it's over off top
Before I'm sayin' to my dogs everytime the dope is chopped
Feel that, my niggas will ride wit' me
Snoop and Master P said that they'll die for me

Chorus til' song ends</pre>
