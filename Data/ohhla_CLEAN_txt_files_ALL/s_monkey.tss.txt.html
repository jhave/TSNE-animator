[Too $hort]
Put a hump in your back and shake your rump [4x]

Lets Go
[Chorus- Lil Jon]- 2X
Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low
Freak that nigga till your shit get sore

[Verse 1- Too $hort]
Bounce that ass till you can't no more
Make your ass touch the floor till your legs is broke
Take that big ol' booty girl and scrub the ground
You can do it up and down and round and round
As long as that pussy ain't stiff
Dance and make all the niggaz look at that shit
Like a stripper at a club in the ATL
Lil bitch tore it up and started raisin hell
I remember Magic City before the freakness
Before the police went on all them weak shit
All them big hoes, get loose w/ it
All them skinny hoes, let Bruce Bruce hit it
Let a nigga fuck tonight
Damn right bitch, fuck my wife
You my slut for life
You know all I do, is count that cash
I won't charge you as long as you bounce that ass

[Chorus]-2X

 Biaatch....Biaatch....Shake that Monkey

[Verse 2]
I bet she can't wiggle like with a dick in her
Have a motor booty contest and pick a winner
When she runnin', you never see a hoe come in last
She's so fast she's got a 454 in her ass
You never gonna win that race
Put on a seatbelt and don't let her sit on your face
She might kill you in the morning at 2:14
Doin' the pussy pop like she from New Orleans
Its been a while more than 10 years past
When you close your eyes you can still see her ass
Her momma used to dance like that
Bouncin' that ass with her hands on her back
I saw her grandmomma do it with a baby in her arms
Put her hand on a car and started swingin' it hard
Every nigga at the party wanna get with the bitch
Look like she was fucking an invisible dick

[Chorus]-2X

[Verse 3]
You don't have to be naked to dance like a stripper
Just wiggle that tail like your name is flipper
Do it like a dolphin on top of the water
Take it down to the ground and pop it harder
You been hangin' around them pimps again
Got ya gangsta walkin' like in Memphis, Tenn
Get it girl, I like the way you bounce
She must have learned that deep down way in the south
You from the west coast where you learned to do that dance
I'm about to stick my dick through the back of your pants
I wouldn't pass up a chance to grip your cheeks
Fall in that ass and keep me for a week
Now all that booty, is that for me
Its lookin' so fat, we at the party
Lets hit the bar and drink, Tequilla shots
Find a spot on the floor, lemme see it drop

 [Chorus]-2X

[Too $hort]
Now put your ass on his dick
Let him know you the baddest lil'bitch
Put your hand on your clit, ask him do he like that shit
The way you move your butt
All he wanna do is fuck
Outside him and you in the truck
Sex so good you can't do it enough [2x]

Bounce that ass bitch
Bounce that ass bitch
Bounce that ass bitch
Short dog in the house
Just bounce that ass
Shake that monkey hoe
Shake that monkey hoe
Shake that monkey hoe
Lemme see you shake that monkey
Biaatch</pre>
