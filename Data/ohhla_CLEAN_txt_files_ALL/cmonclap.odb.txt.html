[Chorus 2X: Swizz Beatz]
Ol' Dirty make the girls say
Come on, clap, come on, clap, come on, clap
Come on, everybody, come on, clap
Come on, yo

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
No it's Dirt McGirt, ain't a damn thing changed
Just put spinners on a brand new Range
When I walk up in the party everything seem strange
Oooh, must be that Roc-A-Fella chain
I mixed it up, with that Wu-Tang slang
That college girl over there, she give good brain
When I pull out my gun, it goes chitty bang bang
I love 'em fat bitches cuz they titty hang hang
When I'm trying to get some food stamps, to buy some champagne
When you in the senior cars, gonna make you switch lanes
Blame it on the muthafucking game

[Chorus 2X]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Now, come, get some, you little bum
I'm Dirt McGirt, still living in the slums
Yeah, that's where I'm from
And I got enough liquor, you can all get some
The Swizz Beatz drum, bang through your speaker
I don't want no bud, cuz that ain't no good reefer
Forget from the Dirt, though, I'm the grim reaper
And I might hit it once and pass to my man Peter
Adios see ya, would hate to be ya
Your man talk shit, I'mma put him in the sleeper
So get down, get down, like James Brown
Roc-A-Fella money got me feeling lot better now

[Chorus 2X]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Oooh, love it when you shake it to the ground
You serve in town, ODB comes around
Blaow, listen to my drunken style
Got enough Chambers, I can hit it going wild
Rims on my truck is bigger than a cow
Chpaow! Jewelry cost more than your house
If you cooking in your kitchen, get the fuck out
Make them scream and shout "McGirt, get in the house"
Dude gonna air it, I'm barricade, pull it out
If I ain't got my gun, I hit you with the Guinness Stoute
I'm back, buzzed, hit you with a different route
Peace Mariah, for getting a nigga the fuck out

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
