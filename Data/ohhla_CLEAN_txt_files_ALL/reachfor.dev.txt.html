Song:   Reach For It
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus]
You can do, whatever you want
All you got to do, is keep going
You can get, whatever you want
All you've got to do, is reach for it

[Devin the Dude]
Somebody told me, that you said you finna quit
You knew that it was hard, when you started this shit
No sense in giving up, you use to give a fuck
About moving ahead, now you getting scared
Shit that's life, no reward no sacrifice
You thinking twice, maybe because of some bad advice
Get off your ice, and go and out your fucking boots on
You hustle get your loot on, you ball well get your hoop on
Whatever put your suit on, and go finish the job
Time is ticking quickly, not a minute to sob
People depending on ya, come on and toughen up
You can do better than that, come on man what in the fuck
Is you doubting, yourself for
You know I'm down wit ya, I'm just trying to be helpful
Just a friend, trying to lend you a hand
Even if you have to again and again, cause you can

[Chorus]

[Devin the Dude]
Whining, will stop you from shining
So the opposite, is constantly grinding
Cause I've been, in situations thought I would never survive
When demons creep up on ya, in a clever disguise
But it's, nothing that a prayer won't scare
So just keep on praying, and they'll be out your hair
Do it do, it there's nothing to it
When you make your mind up, go 'head and do it
Whatever you want, the choice is yours
Play your position, make sure your voice is heard
Ha-ha, naw that's not my slang
But that's what I'm saying mayn, try some new thangs
And stick with it, get with the program
Stop acting so damn
Hardheaded, and get breaded
It's out there for all of us, let's get it you can

[Chorus]

[Snap]
A close friend told me, you big as the box you put yourself in
So why limit yourself to a small cubicle
We all maneuver through hard times, searching for the light
With dark minds we draw the lines of limitations to find
We all blinded by self doubt, don't deny the fact if it helps out
Utilize the flame from the candle, before it melts out
Now haters come a dime a dozen, you know that's a factor
But patience is a virtue, something we gon' have to practice
Now disassociate yourself from the slackers, and pack up your baggage
You should be glad, it's not the end of the madness
At least you'll get a chance, to glance back at it
Really that's the only way, to examine your bad habits
Now that's tragic, don't be maneuvering as if
You on your last leg, your head is low and you ask if
You can make it, despite your multiple obstacles
So focus on goals in your life, and do what you gotta do cause

[Chorus]</pre>
