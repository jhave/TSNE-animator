[Verse 1]
It's a MIA, you gon' be Missing In Action
Bitch I'm grabbin' and jackin' then I bust in action
I mean they stealin' from me and takin' bread from my family
Head full ah distress I'm usually the wizard in this
Blood thicker than water, nigga watch what ya holla
Your title DOA if you get ticket to play
Families pray when you lay, hit you wid that AK
Anytime ah the day, my nigga fuck what you say
Make you swallow your spit, bitch for fuckin' wid this
Cause I'ma raw ass bitch, and I'ma hard ass bitch
I'm the shit on the stain, I'm the car that you claim
I'm the weed that you smoke, when you feed it and choke
So please escape to my pimpin' because yo ass gon' be missin'
And it's a DOA if you get ticket to play, nigga,
Who rock the pump and take the pain out,
I, I rock the pump and take the pain out

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You think your knowledge is deep, then this wish was mine
Nigga wished a pause on yo hatin', this a method of mine
That mean I'm standin' to strong than to ever be faded
You niggas flip up yo hate and lay the real on the table
Understandin' the Boss is like payin' the cost
Wid yo mouth shot off and then yo body got tossed look here,
Bring me your anna instead ah spreadin' your rumours
Because they spread like pumas, I don't dig what ya shootin'
Bitch you locked in the game, steady searchin' for fame
Lookin' for some that money so hell yo life'll maintain
But since you ain't got shit, you can't hate on a Bytch,
So put some dick in yo mouth and put yo cock on the house
You in the midst of a playa I'm talkin' straight to you haters
My nigga will look you in your face and say no you can't fade her
Cause they call me a bitch, I'm gon act like a bitch
Fuckin' up niggas I hurt and I kick and I whoop yo ass like a bitch, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Well it's a must that does puttin' haters to dust
You niggas always talkin' shit but y'all ain't ready for us
Some real niggas up in this bitch and we ain't showin' no love
I want shit in this game man I'm on a come up
Niggas don't give a fuck who you be, what you claim, who been through
You niggas ain't runnin' shit but who you see in the mirror
You better get that clear hoe, before you bring it here hoe
And I ain't takin' shit from none ah you bitch ass niggas
Do not play wid me boy, do I look like a toy
Do I look like a game, that you plan to enjoy
Do I look like a bitch, that you treat like a snitch
Or do I look like a hoe, who's got much ah that flow
Nigga HELL NAW!, so nigga FUCK YOU!
Nigga HELL NAW!, so nigga FUCK YOU!
Nigga HELL NAW!, so nigga FUCK YOU!
Nigga HELL NAW!, so MOTHERFUCK YOU NIGGA!
