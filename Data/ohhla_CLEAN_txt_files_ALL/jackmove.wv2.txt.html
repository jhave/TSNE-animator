[Big Syke]
Nigga You betta get cha money
Fuck dat I'm tired of bein broke Daz
Let's go get our chips
 
[Daz]
That nigga Daz on the street at a early age
Barely made it out da twelfth grade
But the man will still stay paid
Stayed away from the little homies who wanted to play basketball
All up on it money was fast life was all
These niggaz blew em and presumed it was all like cling
It seems it wont be long to buy a composite dream
Call up the homie Syke
Meet me at the market it's a heist
60 G's a piece its big money on the street gotta have it
Whenever I bone gotta make it better 
Whether I'm rich or broke my eye is to stay clever
It's a jack move so motherfucker don't say nothin'
Stop the teller give up the cash bitch don't say nothin
Fatal pull up quickly wit tha ride
So we hop inside countin the money wit my dogs feelin high
Bought a new riviera oh deez from ?? on G's
Do whatever I feel Jackers know the deal
Keep the pistol loaded and cocked
Right now I move the block
When I kick fuck the whole hood is getting licked
Say what Dogg pound got love underground
Along with my homie from the town that bump the ground

[Big Syke]
I trapped inside my self I needa change my ways
Niggas get shot to death searchin for better days
Peepin out the heist pay the price if you wanna ball
After all get yo niggaz it's the final call
I can't stall Daz put me on the liquor hit
Cause I'm fed up and tired of that broke shit
Steady on the grind I got to get mine who wanna die
Starvin and broke don't multiply stay high
Im neck deep I cant sleep wit no dividends
I play to win livin in the sin will it end
So let the G ride slide county state to state
Cause I wont hesitate to distentigrate
One time evil mind thuggin cartel
I kill everybody in this motherfucker so give me the mail
I cant tell leave no witnesses I handle my business
Cause I'm full of that sickness Lets do this

[Chorus: Daz]
Its jack move
Muthafucka don't say nothin it's a jack move
Do you really think we bluffin it's a jack move
Give it up mothafucka it's a jack move
Do you really think we bluffin it's a jack move

[Kadafi]
Now as I position myself to the opposition my aim is stacked wealth
In this world of greed
Kadafi calm lyrical bomb easy get me fetully crucified 
Like you was Jesus on the floor spread like diseases
Crack in the hemmy I stay cool locked in the semi
Automatic niggaz jumpin like acrobatics
When static eruct you stuck
Witout a fuckin bucket to piss in 
For all you cowards that's dissin
Heres a bitch named glock for your nuts to be kissin
I said it just like the midnight moves
From nights to afternoon get cooked up like coke in a spoon
Protect your body from repeated shots from my fuckin shotty
Layin it down wit my road dawg Hussein Kadafi
Cuttin ya ear ta ear 
Spinnin these niggaz headgear
Like I'm county bound 
Whilein from tear ta tear
Shootin and poluttin this atmosphere 
Wit cakes and aches awaits through the fuckin state 
Tryin ta come up in this world cuz its money we make

[Napolean]
I got some niggaz back in jerzey and most of em dead
I got some killa niggaz in cali cuz most of em said
That when the jump lick lead
From murderton to the plauge we getting down for whats said 
That its based on the feds 
So nigga heres my documentary
Started in elementary 
Nigga gotta speak soft to the street because it befriended me
Drinkin my hennesy listen to moonie cause hes schoolin me
Lickin shots at the cops bless the dead rest in peace ta boonie
Now its on cause like a reef I'm comin home 
And when dem niggaz hit the streets we goin shoppin for chrome
Keep it known that I'm shootin and fuck the world I'm pollutin
If it keep pursuein ima turn my business to lootin
Near no nigga can stop me from bein young and cocky 
Betta take me the way you see me or a mothafucka or drop me
Told my grams I'm a killa Bad boy n she feel it
My people told me bout the secretz of war I cant spill it
Got four four four dem hoes 
Plenty counted for hoes 
I'm Drinkin ginsing now watch me get this bitch out her clothes
See yall niggaz want more
What ima give you for sure
Is a couple hot ones to the dome and leave you creepin back home
My niggaz call me Napol move top for dem hoes
Thinkin of creepin on yo block to leave yo punk ass froze
My niggaz rose from they graves
Teach me how to dip strays
This thug life that I'm livin is like a game but it pays

[Chorus]

[Hussein Fatal]
What tha fuck you think this is hands up everybody spread em
First motherfucker move yaki kadafi wet em
Aint nobody getting out alive 
If I don't get the amount I came for
Plus a motherfuckin ounce
And bounce cuz I'm on that kind of shit nobody knowin
Alias hussein everybody who look strange I'm blowin
I got the blood from ya body blowin haulin ass
With daz and money bags and the ass of the shottie showin
Play the hero I bring the heat to the street
Like Al pacino and Deniro eliminate twenty muthafuckaz to zero
Watch me the streets is black hockey rules of the game 
To never let a cop top me

[Kurupt]
The jack is on from noon to the crack of dawn
Me and my niggaz storm attack vietnam swarm
You cant stop me I shoot with loot drop it
Rip ya arms out they socket
Cause you aint quick enough to empty ya pockets
The homies stole 10 G's is the plot
We got a lot at stake first nigga make a sound get shot
So I'm set no sweat never catch me sweatin
No regrets I aint regrettin all the shit that I'm gettin
And I keep my mind state clear 
Posessin no fear
No need to look no further nigga I'm here
I gots da ammo
I also gots the ride ta roll
We gots the plot and got the route
That gets to the pot uve gold
Its good as go I'm in the position
Ready to unload all the ammunition
On spots count my riches hit the yaucht and go fishin
Then confuse of course it goes smooth 
You at the right place the wrong time then its you and ya crue
It's a jack move...</pre>
