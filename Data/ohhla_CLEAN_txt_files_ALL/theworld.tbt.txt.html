[Mannie]
I know you wish you could find a
Nigga wit a dick like a anaconda
Neighborhood hot boy, super-shiner
Pimp, playa, president, Big Tymer, tymer
I ride on chrome givin bitches the blues
Got the brand new Mo-Moes, twenty inch shoes
Every city I go, these hoes know
Dick slingin contest after the show
Shootin off like a cannon, nuts landin
Right up in va-gana, dick still standin
Hard like a mack test, mega mess
I love it when you walk around showin ya breast
Load music got us shinin, drinkin wine
Bustin out rubbers like it's 1999
Diamonds like street lights, racin bikes
Candy paint, chromed out, dual pipes
I wish I could love every broad the same
Have kids all over with my last name
Ya'll niggas don't think I'm serious, huh
Ya'll think it's a game
But I'm bout the money, the bitches, the cars, and the fame

[Chorus]
Ball like a dawg (I'm on top of da world)
Everybody in the clique, ball like a dawg (We on top of da world)
Ya got diamonds round ya neck, ball like a dawg (I'm on top of da world)
Ya ride 20 inch flats, ball like a dawg (Top of da world)
Aw aw, ball like a dawg, aw aw, ball like a dawg
Everyday, all day, ball like a dawg (I'm on top of da world)
Everybody in the clique, ball like a dawg (We on top of da world)
Ya got diamonds round ya neck, ball like a dawg (I'm on top of da world)
Ya ride on 20 inch flats, ball like a dawg (Top of da world)
Aw aw, ball like a dawg, aw aw, ball like a dawg

[Baby]
Nigga, know me as a big wheeler, nigga call me a car dealer
I'm gon' floss 'til the lord steal me
I'm gon ball like a dawg, nigga feel me
Lamborgini's bullet proof, nigga you can't kill me
Vacationin at Las Vegas casinoes
Wit about 100 G's worth of c-notes
Lookin at all these pretty hoes
Gettin beeps from my niggas 'bout some cash flow
I gotta head back to the motherfuckin N.O.
And clique up wit my motherfuckin negroes
And tell Stank get the Lexus cruise 4 doors
And beep the clique, tell 'em strap we 'bout to roll
Go and eat fetticini with the main hoes
And where trillionaire earrings how the game go
Billionaire status from this fuckin rap flow
Tattoed and I'm dealin with them white folks

[Chorus]

[Mannie]
I got a brand new rubber
Tell ya bitch I love her
Meet me at the hotel so I could shove a
Big ass [blanked] in her back
How you luv that?
Big dick down in the drawers is what I pack
Gold Roleys full of gems
Twenty inch rims
Big screen TV showin porno films
Rover, Jag, and a boat
Dinosaur boots wit the motherfuckin matchin coat
I'm dynamite like J.J.
Me and Baby
Damn, Damn, Damn is what the bitches say

[Baby]
I visit my mama grave 3 days a week
I ride Jag drop tops so she can see me
She shouts son be all that you can be
Stay on ya feet and keep duckin these white sheets
And play a different broad 7 days out the week
And I'll be watchin when you be on your all-night creep
Or rollin wit ya Rolex bezel on the city streets
Or when ya clubbin and ya huntin for a new freak
Ridin everyday on chrome and ya packin heat
Mama, I know you lookin down on me
But I'ma ball 'til I fall, fuck the industry
And cash million dollar checks wit my real peeps
And I'ma sag Uptown on this battlefield
And aint gon' let no nigga take no food out my grill
And we gon' ball 'til we fall as we keep it real
Wit gold choppers, nigga you know the deal

[Cadillac]
