KICK ASS!
(Mmm-hmm) C'mon
(Uh-huh, mm-hmm)
Y'all boys don't know NUTTIN bout me (mm-hmm, uh-huh)
Ya heard? .. "Ladies and gentlemen!"

[Juvenile]
I'ma T.C. soldier, New Orleans stunna
If a bitch leave me, I'ma take everything from her
Leave while ya can, or ya mom will pick ya rum up
I'ma find me some new pussy, and buy a Four-Runner
I walk with a limp, cause my nuts heavy
And I like it from the back so hold your butt steady
I know I got some big lips, but I ain't trippin
And momma I love pussy, but I ain't lickin
Now prepare yourself for a smooth dickin
You don't want it girl?  You don't know, what you missin
I'm the baddest boss nigga walkin, you ain't heard?
I got a team of head busters waitin to give 'em the word
I gotta few in the East Coast, a few in the West
Down-South to Mid-W, whattup to the rest
Can't forget about the ghetto where they strugglin in debt
No matter what I do dawg, I love my set - "Ladies and gentlemen!"

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Wodie, Wassup, Wodette, Wassup, Wodie, Wassup
Set it off in this motherfucker
Wodie, Wassup, Wodette, Wassup, Wodie, Wassup
Set it off in this motherfucker
Wodie, Wassup, Wodette, Wassup, Wodie, Wassup
Set it off in this motherfucker
Wodie, Wassup, Wodette, Wassup, Wodie, Wassup
Set it off in this motherfucker

[Juvenile]
The niggidy niggidy Nile's in this bitch, get right
Fuck what you heard on the street it's CMR for life
Still ridin on dubs, sippin brown and white
Jump stupid if you want bitch we gon' clown tonite
We got twenty-five choppers in the V.I.P.
Cristal and 40 yack and a pound of weed
I know you wait for me to get drunk, and follow me home
Picture what I'ma give you though - a shot to yo' dome
Fuck it if your boys gon' be talkin they gon' get hit too
I'm really not givin a fuck, long as I get you
Jamie, Fresh, Joe, Bubba
Ya gotta admit ha, Juvie a motherfucker
I'ma general, executin the plan
Got a vision of the 3rd Ward, rulinn the land
Runnin up on hoes, tellin them to jump in the van
Mommy please come break off just me and my man

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
55% of these niggaz is fake
The other 45% be handlin they weight
55% of these women is hoes
The other 45% be playin they role
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
Take these motherfuckin cuffs off of us
We ain't kill nobody in this car, for us
And ridin on 20's is the law for us
I ain't from France, but excuse my french
Fuck ya if ya hatin, nigga save that then
I been dealin wit you bitches from way back then
Plus I kept a fire duck off the lay back in
You say my momma played me and J be tight
Cause Juvie takin care, so everything alright
Bitches see the sliver seraph wit them phat ass pipes
Bein followed by some niggaz on some bad ass bikes

[Chorus]</pre>
