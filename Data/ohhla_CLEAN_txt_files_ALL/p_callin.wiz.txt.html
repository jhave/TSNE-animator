Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Oh, oh, ooooh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, ooooh

Back better than ever
Ask me what I'm doing, I've been stacking, autographing
Smoking tree with your girlfriend if she let us
Making sure my bags packed for any weather
Tighten up, your team starting to let up
Assembly need to get it together
I remember there was days I wasn't able to change clothes
Now I never wear the same clothes
Same goes for my bad bitch, rich and her accent thick
But her ass aint, she'll carry my last name
Still a step I'll never miss, I'm on this cash chase
Ballin' off the glass change
Jordan, me and my gang running the game
You niggas just tryna find what the score is
I can hear that money callin'
Aint in the position you're in, can't ignore it
I'm all in

And they sayin' that we changed
Homie, they don't know as much as they think they know
(as much as they think they know)
And you know I love to stay with you
But I gotta go, baby I hear that paper callin'
(Paper callin', paper callin')
Another day, another plane
Baby girl, I hear that paper calling
(Paper callin', paper callin')
I'm going out the door as soon as that paper call
(Paper call, paper call) </pre>
