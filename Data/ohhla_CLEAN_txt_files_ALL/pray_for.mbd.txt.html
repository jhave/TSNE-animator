Typed by: redone9@hotmail.com

[Lil' Mo] + (Prodigy)
Pray for me, pray for me
Pray for me, pray for me (yeah)
Pray for me, just pray for me
(It's over nigga!)

[Lil' Mo] + (Prodigy)
Living life with all this thugness, destruction this violence
My projects I'm a rep to the fullness
You know it (yeah, you know, understand this)
I'm always gon' be infamous (It's over, it's over)
Untill the day he layin' me down to rest (You dead, you dead)
When I'm in this world
Just pray for me (you can't stop it)

[Prodigy]
The Invicible infamous Mobb Deep nigga fuck you
If you touch one of my dunns I'll buck you
You ain't got nuts enough to come through
And get back at my niggas for them gun wounds
You a punk bitch ass nigga you soft duke
I'm a young rich ass nigga who love to
Show you how a nigga get his lights blew
Teach you the mystery GOD and murk you
Burry you mother fuckers in the ce-ment
Miss a post of that nigga in the pre-cent
Should of known my niggas don't play with stunts
Should of shot back but you got your dome cut
While party with the pretty little cu-tties
You'll be fertilizing the dirt for new trees
Fucking with the mobbsters out in Q.B
Nigga you get hung for that shit that your mouth speak
Bitch ass nigga

[Chorus: Lil' Mo] + (Havoc) or {together}
Just pray for me (when I'm out in the world)
Just pray for me (and if you down for whatever)
{You'll wait for me} (I got these cowards out tryin to lay for me)
{And they makin me} (So just pray for me)
(And I can see it in thier eyes) {they afraid of me}
(Homeboy I ain't the one) {You mistaken me}
(While you ratting and snaking me)
(They making me, so just pray for me)

[Havoc]
We them niggas that pull them things out
Niggas talk too much need to shut mouth
A lose lip will sink a niggas ship for real
Then act all suprise when they get killed
Got two fellonies, but take a chance still
My life comes first fuck a record deal
Move that crowd, direct with steel
For a medicine when niggas act ill
The H-A-V the O the C
Be easy the way that you approach me
Didn't see it coming but he got his plug pulled
That chicks shiesty don't go by what looks good
We in the ear, trust she heard that
Why you loving 'eml my niggas tap that
Fake gangstas I can see right through them
Cross that line and get your life ruined

[Lil' Mo]
Living life with all this thuggness, destrction this violence
My projects I'm a rep to the fullness
You know it
I'm always gon' be infamous
Untill the day he layin' me down to rest
When I'm in this world
Just pray for me

[Chorus]

[Lil' Mo sings]
When I'm out in the world
Just pray for me
And if you down for whatever
You'll wait for me
I got these cowards out tryin to lay for me
And they making me
So just pray for me
And I can see it in thier eyes their affraid of me
Homeboy I ain't the one you mistaken me
While you ratting and think your snaking me
They making me, so just pray for me</pre>
