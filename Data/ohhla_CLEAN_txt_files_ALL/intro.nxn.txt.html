[Doap Nixon]
Yo, Yo, John Kennedy rap
Niggaz cooked and sold they soul for stacks
I put the drugs down, so I got my memory back
New drinks bring the energy back
Mentally clap at this whole game (blap blap) with penitentiary raps
Got my freedom 'bout a century back
Couldn't swim nine thousand miles so they said Kenny was black
That means I'm half original, dominant color's the visual
Can't live life without principles
I joined a team and we all identical
Lyrical heavyweights on the tip of this tentacle
I'm out for blood and I'ma get it dawg
Get it all back and see what it's hittin for, nigga Sour Diesel
