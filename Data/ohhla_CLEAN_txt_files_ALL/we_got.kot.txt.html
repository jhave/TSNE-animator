Song:   We Got the Chronic
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We got the chronic
We got the chronic
We got the chronic
We got the chronic

[chorus]
Come through with a gang of smoke (man)
all we do is get high off these tokes (man)
these people know we ain't no joke (man)
The Kottonmouth Kings we just keep on smokin'

Come through with a gang of smoke (man)
all we do is get high off these tokes (man)
these people know we ain't no joke (man)
The Kottonmouth Kings we just keep on smokin'

Yo, we from the home of the brave
Land of the free where we blaze all day
Where the low lows bounce and the palm trees sway
California's one ?state when the shit pops out

The west coast don't play
So move bitch, Get out my way, Get out my way
I said move bitch, Get out my way
Stay the fuck out my way or you might get blazed

You ask any motherfucker whos got the chronic
And there gonna tell you Johnny Richter's always on it
Unlike the government, I'm only being honest
'Cause the bong rips I pack are the bombest

I got everybody callin 'cause they want it
The cops want me so bad, I got a warrent
?? Yo i always flaunt it
In a shirt and matchin' hat that reads "I god the chronic"

[chorus]
Come through with a gang of smoke (man)
all we do is get high off these tokes (man)
these people know we ain't no joke (man)
The Kottonmouth Kings we just keep on smokin'

Come through with a gang of smoke (man)
all we do is get high off these tokes (man)
these people know we ain't no joke (man)
The Kottonmouth Kings we just keep on smokin'

We got the chronic - And it aint no lie
I'm comin' through the door with straight Chinese eyes
Got them like an ?Asian, eye lids on too
Blazed? like Jamacian, ya'll know how I feel

I'm smokin chronic - And i'm gettin super ripped
Green crack, I'm trippin on some ?bucked out shit
Johnny Ric's about the blow off a big bong rip
And then he passed to Loc, Yo its time to take that hit

Bang Bang, Light 'em up, Hurry up, Wassup
Where the weed? Where the chronic? Grab a beer, roll a blunt
Double Double Double Double Double dash give a fuck
Dgaf waht the fuck, you can suck my nuts

I said, all you punks talkin shit sucks nuts
'Cause my weeds bomb, and your weed sucks
I said, all you punks talkin shit sucks nut
You can ride this dick, uh, until I come.

[chorus]
Come through with a gang of smoke (man)
all we do is get high off these tokes (man)
these people know we ain't no joke (man)
The Kottonmouth Kings we just keep on smokin'

Come through with a gang of smoke (man)
all we do is get high off these tokes (man)
these people know we ain't no joke (man)
The Kottonmouth Kings we just keep on smokin'

We got the chronic - Bang Bang light 'em up
We got the chronic - You know we still dont give a fuck
We got the chronic - See we 10 years deep
We got the, we got the, we got the bammer city weeds

We got the chronic so we 'gon light it up
Cause we got the chronic and what you got it bud
I said, we got the chronic and we gonna burn a bag
'Cause we got the chronic and what you got is Schwag

I'm not a stoner but i do get stoned
I'm know to put it down on this microphone
Get High Times mag sent straight to my home
Got my bong in my sack so I'm never alone, well...

I ain't a hippy but I'm covered in dirt
Sippin lots of mushroom tea in a tye-dye shirt
Chasin' the Grateful Dead, no shoes on my feet
Beggin' in the parking lot for something to eat, see...

I'm not a gangster but I'm down for my shit
I'll tell ya now son, I'm fully equipped
Got a glock nine milli if you wanna get silly
But I'd rather kick back and get ripped (get ripped)

[chorus]
Come through with a gang of smoke (man)
all we do is get high off these tokes (man)
these people know we ain't no joke (man)
The Kottonmouth Kings we just keep on smokin'

Come through with a gang of smoke (man)
all we do is get high off these tokes (man)
these people know we ain't no joke (man)
The Kottonmouth Kings we just keep on smokin'

We got the chronic - Bang Bang light 'em up
We got the chronic - You know we still dont give a fuck
We got the chronic - See we 10 years deep
We got the, we got the, we got the bammer city weeds

we got the, we got the bammer city weeds
we got the, we got the bammer city weeds
we got the, we got the bammer city weeds
we got the, we got the bammer city weeds?</pre>
