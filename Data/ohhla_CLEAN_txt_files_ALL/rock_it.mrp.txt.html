[Master P and 5th Ward Weebie]
No Limit
I'mma make y'all have it for a minute
But we want it back for the next 5 years
Hit the dancefloor, whodi!
The new No Limit baby
Respect it or check it
Master P, 5th Ward Weebie
Krazy

[5th Ward Weebie]
You got to rock the boat
Rock, rock, rock the boat
Rock, rock, rock the boat
And do the Beattown Mo
Rock, rock, the boat
Rock, rock, rock the boat
Rock, rock, rock the boat
And do the Beattown Mo

[Hook x2]
Ooh ooh baby come on you can wobble wit it
Ooh ooh baby come on you can hustle wit it
Do the Beattown Mo, get cocky wit it
Put ya hands in the air don't stop wit it

[Master P]
They call me the Ghetto Bill got the keys to the city
Hit the club for the girls lookin pretty
Big butts with them little-bitty waist-es
Ghetto fab but looks just like a waitress
Rip on her name was Sonya
Roxanne, Monique I put it on ya
It ain't No Limit to the change I got
You see the Bentley on the 20's in the parking lot

[Krazy]
Hennessy and trees, that's all I need
Back it up, don't stop
Hit the floor, make it drop

[5th Ward Weebie]
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
It goes left, right, left, right
left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right

[Chorus]

[5th Ward Weebie]
Make that thing whistle
Move around and whistle
Twurk for that thing don't stop it till ya whistle
Make that thing whistle
Move around and whistle
Twurk for that thing don't stop it till ya whistle
Weebie ain't gonna stop cause I know what ya want
Put a hump in your back and lift your rump
Now bring it around the world won't you jump for me
Bounce bounce baby baby make it jump for me
Where your head go at when you want it from the back
Them No Limit Souljas got you shakin' it like that
You can dance if you wanna do it if you wanna
Move it in a circle and put that thing in the corner
Shake if you wanna shake shake baby
No Limit not givin you a break baby
Now make that thing whistle
Move around and whistle
Twurk for that thing don't stop it till ya whistle
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
It goes left, right, left, right
left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right

[Chorus]

Make that thing whistle
Move around and whistle
Twurk for that thing don't stop it till ya whistle
Make that thing whistle
Move around and whistle
Twurk for that thing don't stop it till ya whistle

[Master P]
We all thugs but I ain't gonna hurt nobody
Make it shake girl work that body
I want one thick like Bubblicious
That can clean the house and do the dishes
I'm lookin for a girl that can twurk
A thug chick that can put in work
Handle business with a mini-skirt
Jump suave with a P. Miller purse
Handle business on the dance floor make it twurk
Drop it like a dog then make it jerk
If I was in it they'd call me Don Juan
Gettin' cash then chickens is no crime
VIP is Crys' and Moet
Still thuggin' T-shirts and sweats
Ice cube on my finger 10 karats
I can swing a bat and break a record like Barry

[5th Ward Weebie]
Now Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
It goes left, right, left, right
left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right

[Chorus]

Make that thing whistle
Move around and whistle
Twurk for that thing don't stop it till ya whistle
Make that thing whistle
Move around and whistle
Twurk for that thing don't stop it till ya whistle

[Master P]
