[Shyne]
P-O, nothing more to it
I'm gully, what, I've really been through it
From the stoupe to the coup and anything in between
I carry a sleet through me, niggaz live out they dreams
Throw the ones in the sky or up in the bing
I do it for them, when I'm crackin' them rims
See me doing solo, silver pot holes
Bustin' off Roscoe's, like fuck it, I'll buy a new set tomorrow
I'm the horror, the system belt
Suck liquor, out my mom's tits, instead of milk
I'm society's filth, shit, I feel no guilt
Well fear couldn't feed Po, what the fuck, I need mo'
Mo', mo', catch me posted up on one Pivot
By the looks of my arm and palm, it's been a blizzard
Bitches wanna know, who that nigga Po
When you think of me, just think of snow
Call white, hard white, masterpiece, all white
It's alright, I could take you out tonight
And put you in some things
Have you lookin' like something, diamonds, buttons
It's the predicate felon, millionaire dollar rederick
Tellin', spittin' thesis, for my connections
Leave a nigga speechless, can't talk with a gun in your throat
Yeah, I'm loc'd, been around too much dope
All my life, brain ain't never been right
Don't hear shit, I air shit, niggaz lose sight
It's bigger than mics, come fuck with the kid
O.G.'s look at me, like that's how I live
Niggaz look from the sky, like, yeah I stay live
Resurrected through the necklace or the gold coated six
Gangsta never die, as long as I'm alive
And when I go, it's gon' be another Po

[Chorus: Shyne]
For all my niggaz who ain't here with me
You still here with me, everything that I do
When you see that watch blue, it's for you
When you see that coupe with no roof, it's for you
For all my niggaz who ain't here with me
You still here with me, everything that I do
Kid that I fried around the way, was for for you
Connect that I tied the other day, was for you

[Shyne]
Yellow tapes, yellow bottles and, yellow rocks
It's the number one gunner, pop pa-pop pop
Hard top, windows black, that's the way, how gangsta mack
Comin' through bumpin' Thriller, like I'm really a killa
Who you know fuckin' with me, them niggaz is bitter
No, I hit you when it's burnin' or numb
Who you, screw you, just for burnin' ya gums, get it right
I'm him, ya'll just rhyming
Noise over beats, ya'll niggaz hymen
My other shit is real, I'm buyin' jet fuel
Them cuts on my shit, is Princess Blue
You fuck with the kid, you get princessed too
What, ya boyfriend a rapper? This between me and you
And that's just how my niggaz would want it, America's most wanted
State ya name, P.O., niggaz know

[Chorus]

[Chorus II: Shyne]
For all my niggaz who ain't here with me
You still here with me, everything that I do
Bitch I hit with the long dick, it's for you
Bong bong, paid time just for you
For all my niggaz who ain't here with me
You still here with me, walk with me, talk with me
Let that sawed off shit, bark off with me
What's up with my niggaz, I'm with my niggaz</pre>
