Uh-huh

[Parrish Smith]
Yo it's the return (uh-huh) Parrish Smith and Erick Serm'
Kid don't mess with fire because you will get burned
Cause we earn respective checks, regulated when a nigga flex
to get a rep totin mack-10's and techs
Hoes and sex, weed and Beck's, and first class flights
You name it, niggaz had it, and still got it
Always rhymin with a pardon
like Roxanne I'm about to cold _Get Retarded_
You know the logo, and on mics, sometimes we flow slow
Not loco, universal, type vocal
Mogul, so don't make me wild out and have to show you
who I am, strapped with E-Double my man
Back in Business once again, plus we backed by Def Jam

This is the funk (huh) comin out of your trunk
Erick and Parrish for years we've been makin it thump
From East to West coast, EPMD you pump
Icons in hip-hop, takin MC's to lunch
Cause it's the funk (funk funk) comin out of your trunk
Erick and Parrish for years we've been makin it thump
From East to West coast, EPMD you pump
Icons in hip-hop, takin MC's to lunch

[Erick Sermon]
Aiyyo it's E the Elusive, comin through with a dope exclusive
Hawkin niggaz, like I'm Yusef
Gettin down, makin it happen for those who don't believe
the incomporable, comin through stompin you
My Squad is Def, and we don't hear nuttin
I'm in the back of the crib, on the green puttin
I be the boss in this, who the fuck comin through torchin this
ball your fists up quick
I'm the black Bill Gates, my chips be Micro
Bad like Michael, don't make me fight you
You a hater, and my crew don't like you
On the real you suck, who the hell hyped you?
You a comic Russell would say good night too
at the Def Jam, screw you and your man
Rock the house like BizMark, if so let the fifth spark
sometime after dark
