[Chorus]
Represent! Get Krunk! Represent! Get Krunk!
If you know you're repping Jesus go ahead and throw it up
Represent! Get Krunk! Represent! Get Krunk!
If you know you're repping Jesus go ahead and throw it up
Represent! Get Krunk! Represent! Get Krunk!
If you know you're repping Jesus go ahead and throw it up
Represent! Get Krunk! Represent! Get Krunk!
If you know you're repping Jesus go ahead and throw it up

[Lecrae]
I know this might be a shock but, I'mma blow your spot up
Truthfully in Grace and out of Love, aint trying to pop stuff
Heard ya pops locked up
Baby sister's knocked up
All your old boys from the block are getting shot up
I feel your pain homey, I got the same story
But since you came to Christ you got to bring His name Glory
No more living in the darkness, no more living heartless
Cause you got that Holy Spirit dwelling inside your carcass
Your life's been changed up, rearranged up
You've been reborn and you don't have to do the same stuff
You live regenerate, you get the benefit of Christ crucified
But you got to live in it, God is preeminent
And forgiveness is unlimited, but stop! and...

[Chorus]

[Tedashii]
From the flats to the drops to the burbs
Calling out to the cats who be dropping the word
Who be representing Christ, Not ashamed to share his life
Catching flack for his props in the world
To the cats that represent Him well while putting the Cross on the move
As they reaching for the cats who
Steppin into hell while they flossing new shoes
Packin gats and flossin new coupes
Making hoodrats doin' the do, acting a fool
But the jigga that figures pullin the trigger
With vigor can make him bigger needs to get in with the Cox Grave Digger
Cause you live a life sin thats the wages of death
If you livin by the gun that's the way into debt
But if you living the life and living it right
Put your fist in the sky with all of your might
Til you way out of breath, chest pumping all hard due to heavy palpitations
Thirsting for the Lord with Heavy salivation
But you aint fraud you'll pull a sinners card
Cause you love the Lord and His habit of salvation repping like Steven
Getting stoned for the stone you believe in
Or slinging the stone into the dome of the heathen Philistine men
