Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I got the drug that you need in my Medicine bag a poor mans therapy on a bumpin track
Everybody get a fist that the demand is hot so hit your mom and pop shop and get a supply
Worldwide I'm coming at you serving you up with the dose of the dope music having you
Hooked everybody go and get it now don't be shy cuz its okay to have a little killer on you
Mind I got the good shit that makes your legs twitch and tweak around the party when its on
The playlist Ima have you in a whole new type of trans gonna keep you coming back cuz you
Feeling the dance got ya shaking like a bitch in a horror flick or a tazed criminal after hitting
The lick either way when u try it you will be glad and this is only hit one off the Medicine bag
This is my Medicine bag (let the medicine flow through ya body through ya body through ya body) [x2]

Cant get enough so I'm giving you more I got the killer that you need when you ready to
Score ill have you up to the sunrise banging your head and make your momma wanna
Smack you cuz you wont go to bed the 2nd hit of my new shit hows it taste hold it in if you
Can its to good to waste ya know ya homie got the fire when it comes to this so ain't no need
To look around for the regular shit my music my musical Medicine helps calm the nerves
When ur down and you need some uplifting words why you just cant cope with the lie you
Have and you need a pick me up from the Medicine bag there's plenty to go around no
Need for greed and if you want a second helping ill be there indeed just call on the killa
Press play on the disk and let the sound from the speakers full fill your wish
This is my Medicine bag (let the medicine flow through ya body through ya body through ya body) [x2]

Let the medicine flow through ya body [x8]

Hears a song that you play when you ain't feeling rite because its bad to be stressed out and
All up tight so I had to give you something to make you smile for the people who ain't did it in
A while (the people who ain't did it in a while) ya gotta have as much fun as your body allows
Keep the party on the pumping till ya just pass out anyway you gotta do it don't bee held back
The Medicine that I'm giving is for you to relax
This is my Medicine bag (let the medicine flow through ya body through ya body through ya body) [x2]
Let the medicine flow through ya body through ya body through ya body (this is my Medicine bag)

Rise up work hard for what you want its time to grind yo let mother fuckers know you coming
For what you deserve and if anybody still wanna try n cut you short tell they ass to get down</pre>
