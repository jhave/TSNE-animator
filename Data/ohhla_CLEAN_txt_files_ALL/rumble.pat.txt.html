All you weak ass niggas get yo ass off the floor
We gon rumble in this ho

All you chicken head hoes get yo ass off the floor

[Verse One]
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga

You got some beef nigga

And where I'm from grown men don't take no ass whoopins
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga

So bring your toys nigga

You went to jail and I saw you was a weak punk
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga

But you so thin look like that you do the coke nigga
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga
Think you is a pistol playa
Come in my face and I'll kill you like a dragon slayer

[Chorus]
We gon rumble in this ho

All you bad weed sellers get yo ass off the floor
We gon rumble in this ho
