[Lil Wayne]
Drought 3, wazza

look, I bought it out like stunna
I hope when we kiss we make you sick to your stomach
stunnin like my daddy and yo momma eat rubbers
I bet that I can do the mouth to mouth with your women
my house is a dungeon
yellow diamond ring looking like a little funion
stand on my toes you can call me paul bunyon
touchin up my flows like a nigga do construction
the microphone wet cause my words like seduction
and when we on the jet you don't come up in our discussion
and if you say you ballin we probably don't trust ya
and I know plenty freaky hoes that probably wont fuck ya
even if you payin boy they probably wont fuck ya
only if I say that she can touch you like busta
but she might touch ya and burn you like usher
me and my clit we in red like blusha
I shit these rappers out and sometimes I forget to flush ya
Grand daddy purp or bubble kush crush ya
explode in a bitch mouth like a gusher
cash money young money check the production
I am just a martiaget prepared for obduction
[Laughs x2]

[Lil Wayne]
I'm, I walk it out like crutches
two girls jumped me like double dutchess
my nigga t-street know a girl name dutchess
and everytime I see her in the street she be cussin
I told him he should wave the black flag cause she buggin
he said the pussy good he said you dig so I dug 'em
I'm looking for a real bad bitch with a husband
I'll give her much dick and a whole lot of nothing
I'm spittin like I stumbled on a gold pot or something
and when I was 6 I saw my role model hustlin
so I gotta hustle
these rappers talkin bout a whole lot of nothin
you drive me out on Saturday I sold out on Sunday
fuck is the argue bout, nigga tha carter out
this is what I call a drought.. 3
and we don't walk it out, we drop top porche it out
they betta walk it out, before we chalk 'em out
We chalk it out [x7] we choke 'em out
they don't want none nah-uh, no they don't want none nah-uh
you see they foamin I'm not, oh yeah they foamin I'm not
I eastside walk it out, I bring new orleans out
I am a saints fan, oh yeah we marchin out
like were a saints band, I play the organs now
and if they talkin most likely I'm what they talkin bout
my nigga t from the east roll out the forest now
man I'm just trying to get my peanuts I'm like charlie brown
ok that oozy make the holy sound, take 2 these and walk around
come strait from the homeless town this game belong to carter now, bitch</pre>
