[Verse One]
Come on come on
I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a ne-gro
Pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a he-ro
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
one less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin changes 
learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
and that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
but things changed, and that's the way it is

[Bridge w/ changing ad libs - repeat 2X]
Come on come on
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
aww yeah

[Verse Two]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this 
one better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people they'll be actin right
Cause both black and white, is smokin crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President, uhh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin in the dope game
Now tell me what's a mother to do
Bein real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
"I made a G today" But you made it in a sleazy way
sellin' crack to the kid "I gotta get paid!"
Well hey, but that's the way it is

[Bridge]

[Talking]
We gotta make a change...
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
and let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
what we gotta do, to survive

[Verse Three]
And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the blacks givin it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
crack you up and pimp smack you up
You gotta learn to hold ya own
they get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin back after all these years
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat, that's the way it is, uhh

[Bridge] - repeat 'til fade</pre>
