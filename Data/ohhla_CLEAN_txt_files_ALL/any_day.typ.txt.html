[Qwell]
Rain shine, was fate denied by state time
Ya caged ryhmes contain rage behind gang signs
Remember chickens spittin' game at you
I'm prayin' wit a flow, when you get home I'm fixin' gang tatoos
Forget stress, yes I'll accept the charges
Armed wit curse words and verses to get the guards pissed
I dropped out since we last spoke (what!?)
Commisary, so it sucks son, we all grown up
Fa sho, growin' up was tough more drugs then luck
Fuck a thuggie gettin' bucked you can roll wit us
No more holdin' in stolen trucks
Roll to dunkin' donoughts, where po po n' folks can both hold nuts
Flame up say ya name n' now the whole gangs smoked
N' swear to moms, I'll quit spittin' to get ya chains broken
Ya name is spoken openly
Remember holdin' dreams of bein' dope, yo son they quotin' me
Still the same witty poetry, grown n' smokin' weed
How can we be broke when the city owes us sleep
Or at least a peace of mind, crime was stealin' youth from you
Or who could allude you would'a grew inside a human shoe
There's truth and this troop both sent me to get you
The issue's how windows ain't mirrors when we miss you
More Tatoos, then nights at home
Rockin' this one for you this is your microphone

Chorus
[Denizen Kane]
Life (ah) too fruit to see, to leave root for you to see
[Qwell]
Unique, never enuch, cause stress ain't new to me
Life(ah) too fruit to see, to leave root for you to see
I'm unique, never eunch, cause stress ain't new to me

(Eunch is pronouced Yoo-Nick)

[Denizen Kane]
See I belive in the beloved below the skin, so forgive me if I sin
Skimming the surface before I burrow in
I've been out of this to rub wit the red hands of my fear
So it's just you and belaa, risin' into the clear
Blue, who knew eyes could see so far from up here
Tote, skimmin' the green heads of tree tops under god knows where
Ya sweet do't leave now, or drop like an autmn
Stay wrapped in my hand like a thorn esacped blossoms
Of, red in my palms, now they match my father
Skippin' then stains outta rich mans pants and lipsticollas
Hollerin' to moms about the babble-o-bills and loans again
They gather on the kitchen table, cat shatters
They figured they whisper the other day, about the son who was away to date
The whole store was spreadin', you wishin' the laundry would just wash away
Moms fingers full of stiches, mouth full of pins
Mubbles yes, enter quick request to god with pursed lips
My sons, I lost'em under the rush of adolesence
To impatience pussy pens, funny cigarettes for a lessons
But if she saw me now, with the blade of a smile, nestled in my fluttery wrist
Never repeddle way' my metal
And knew that gods admissions are both open and free
And that he slowed the medics down, the rivers too fast for me
N' edits and re-writes we askith pleasith the human thesis
Any day I'll be embedded in a perfect sentnece please believith

Chorus
[Qwazaar]
Life(ah) to the fruit to the sea, then lead the root for you to see
[Denizen Kane]
I'm unique, never eunch, cause stress ain't new to me
Life(ah) to the fruit to the sea, then lead the root for you to see
I'm unique, never eunch, cause stress ain't new to me

[Qwazaar]
Yo, when I reminisce, I don't remember timbalnds, nothing but pearl wings
Rockin'em wit wit the tongues hangin' outta the front wit no strings
Wit no whites on, yo we frontin' wit fake gold rings
No gold chains, just house keys on shoe strings
So how does anybody sleep on a featherless pillow
With the worlds weight across the shoulder blade tryna smother hope
It's foolish pride, these devils they'll surely try to split you
And force you to sign over ya soul scribin' in physical
Well in a constant conflict, cofidence against incompitence
Tryna grasp the context of lifes concepts
That little bitter peice that I need indeed I'll search for it
I try to ignore time, but I can't afford it
Smokin' weed, thinkin' I surely need employment to feed my spoiled kid
Never been characterized as the type to avoid his choices
Sow now I sacrafice life, the mic's in good faith
But not a penny saved, hopin' to blow like any day</pre>
