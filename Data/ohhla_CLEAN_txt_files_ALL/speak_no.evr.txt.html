Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo
I'm in the studio with my brother, the Half Asiatic
You know, the Fraction of Black Skin and the Smite of White
It's my brother Kool Nick
We about to drop some science on this track about God and what not
You know, the world
So watch me get busy

[ VERSE 1: Everlast ]
Step up, bow your head and be greatful
You hunger for knowledge? i'm serving a plate full
A 12 course meal on a black plate of wax
So MC to feed (then sit back and relax)
And try and digest the data I fed you
I act and react this way cause I'm bred to
The color of my skin something I take pride in
Still my people insist on hidin
Behind the aAerican dream and its lies
(Like the Home of the Free and mom's apple pie
I thought this was a melting pot) I guess not
King stood up up for his rights and he got shot

I speak no evil

Yo Nick, do me a favor, man
Step in

[ VERSE 2: Kool Nick ]
This world is crazy, it must be sick
Be like Nick and get righteous real quick
Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Baptists
Protestants, Hare Krishnas, Catholics
Seek salvation and repentance
This rhyme is from the heart and I meant this
Jesus - shedded his blood for me
He hung on a cross (yo, you know the story)
Nowadays a lot of people are tryin
To worship satan, but you're gonna fry in
Hell, imagine burnin up forever
The forecast is heat, there's no change of weather
Damn, the devil will never twist this
Mind with the mark of the beast or the 666
To God there no one equal
That's why I speak no evil

I speak no evil

[ VERSE 3: Everlast ]
Listen to the story of my Savior
And how he gave up
Life so you could live
That's a hell of a gift to give
(Kick it, E)
Now as I take a look around
I don't see many people down
With my cause, huh, that's scary
Tryin to diss the Son of Mary
You're bein lured, so take the bait and
Fall into the trap of satan
Then your life is over without no sequel
That's why I speak no evil

I speak no evil

(This style is terrific)	--&gt; KRS-One

[ VERSE 4: Kool Nick ]
E (yo) this environment's strange
Brothers gettin shanked on the streets for gold chains
Some smoke crack, cocaine and jumbo
Brains so fried, when they talk they mumble
How could this be society
A ( ? ) place (where none of us wanna be)
People gettin judged by the color of skin tone
It wasn't like this way back with the Flinstones
It's odd, sometimes I get kept back
Because I'm half black, people can't accept that
Yo, accept me for what I am
But what can I do? Cause none of em give a damn
All they want is to drive a Mercedes
Have a million dollars (and live like the Brady's)
But anyways, time is windin, not rewindin
Look in your heart and start findin
Peace and love, no matter what your creed is
(Understand the knowledge at hand) and believe this

I speak no evil
