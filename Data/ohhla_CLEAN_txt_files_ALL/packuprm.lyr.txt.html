Throw your hands up
This is it right here. KRS-One. Dialated
My name is Lyrics Born
Lyrics Born, you gotta hear it. Yes indeed
The follow crew. Performing this right here
Jump all the garbage bags
Yo, Let it go Ev
This, this this is a major affair

[Evidence]
Yea, pack up Evidence exceptional
TO be on Thomas lake, to be late's unacceptable
Of course I talk about myself in third person
Long overdue, set to blow for certain
Three LP's under Capitol Regime
"Platform", "Neighborhood Watch". "Expansion Team"
LA's finest, opening shows I'm headlining
Sometimes its meet-and-greet or in-store signings
A lot of cats claiming Progaine are amateurs
It ain't a good look dog, your hype man's your manager
I seen Lyrics Born perform its curtains
You hit the stage and cause a storm, you know it's working
Weatherman said bring umbrellas tonight
And Dave Letterman said y'all fellas are tight
This is a remix of "Steady Be Serious"
Dialated, KRS-One, our styles are furious

{*Speaking taking place over scratching on the beat*}

[Evidence]
The the the rough mic's up. KRS-One, ONE, ONE
Pick up the mic and give the iller talk
My my my name is, Ly-ly-ly-lyrics Born
Check it out now, I'm the rapper with the deadliest aim
Ya gotta, see-see me-me do my thing

[Lyrics Born]
You know the voice soon as you hear it
Name is Lyrics Born from the legendary crew Latyrx
Pump fear inside your heart until your face is transparent
Type of terror that your children will inherit, you seen a paranormal spirit
Paranoid, I'm a crazy-ass Iroquois
Breakin five-star generals down to errand boys
Claim your territory, redistribute it among, we who
contributed to, this country, we livin in
Cause, these percentages that, we been given
ain't hardly indicative, of what we, put into it
So believe me peasants you in the presence of excellence
Lyrics Born, KRS-One and Evidence
Bow down and kiss the Timbalands
Mather fact, kiss the lizard skins
God damn it, while you're at it, kiss the mission list
I pop my collar, while I pop your coalition
Now a cop showing up 'cause you got a new partnership
I'm shockin your organ like a soft pinada
Getting flauked with the lords when shocked right by the buckets
I can make any music that I want but I make HIP-HOP-hop-hop

{*Speaking taking place over scratching on the beat*}

MY Name is Lyrics Born
Time, time time to bring the busy kids
Ev-Evidence, quick to spill ILL shit
Bringin eight-eight-eightyeight back
Like This y'all

[KRS-One]
Where my socks at, jacket at, shoes at
Twenty city tour, fo sho we gonna do that
Runnin through that, where my crew at
We the best live MC's in the world, but you already knew dat
Who dat, KRS ONE ONE ONE
Got you whack-ass rappers yellin RUN, RUN, RUN
Yo son, hold your horses
Retreat from the streets and count your losses
We teach hip-hop courses constantly
At the university, givin "My Philosophy"
Don't try stopping me, lyric monopoly
All you iced out rappers, y'all just ain't hot to me
See, the hip-hop in me, it's authentic
We at the birth of a nation and y'all don't get it
All that kiddy-titty talk, yo I ain't with it
If you ain't "Ready to Die" then don't spit it
Where the critics, where they at now, we losin 'em
Look at all these conscious rappers, guess who influenced 'em
To them young cats, all of this is new to them
But I remember, you, you and you tried to ruin 'em
Knowledge does reign supreme
When you sitting in a cell, then you'll see what it mean
While you livin in hell, you can count your cream
Does this ring a bell, "I Have a Dream"

{*Speaking taking place over scratching on the beat*}

La-La-la-ladies and gentleman
Yea, good lookin jobo. WOOO
No doubt, remember that day
This y'all, word up. REAL HIP-HOP
This is history in the making
Hope y'all know what to do with this out there
We came to party down
Hold the area, I love y'all
That's it right there, thats it
This, this is a major affair</pre>
