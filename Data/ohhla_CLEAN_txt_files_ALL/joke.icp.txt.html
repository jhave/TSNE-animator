No man get the fuck away from my store man
You make it look bad
Get the fuck outta here
What the fuck, get the fuck outta here you bum
Ain't nobody gonna tell me where I can sleep shit
Fuck him I'm finna sleep here it's better here anyway
I'm cold, rich people ain't cold
Shit they got money and they warm
I'm cold and broke
As a joker, clown
I'm out here makin people laugh
Rich people laugh
I suppose it's funny to see me out here freezing my ass off
I can sleep now
Ain't nobody gonna take that away
I can sleep in this spot

Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Joke your mind, joke your mind
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Joke your mind, joke your mind
Joker jumping joker sing
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Joke your mind, joke your mind
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Wicked clown is in the house

Wake up in my golden bed
The wicked thoughts inside my head
Step outside and glide away
Nothing's wicked here today
I can breathe the magic mist
And excel your every wish
Juggla jump from cloud to cloud
Ring them bells, ring them loud
I can jump across the land
Wind up in the emerald sand
Swing the jewels of endless time
Take it all, cause it's mine
Pour a bowl of chocolate soup
Serve it with the fruit loop
This is my world I am king

Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Joke your mind, joke your mind
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Joke your mind, joke your mind
Joker jumping joker sing
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Joke your mind, joke your mind
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Wicked clown is in the house

I can fall in love like that
In my world she loves me back
If I choose, I choose alone
Freak is gone, boys is on
Cause the homies watch your back
Life is over like that
Once it's done, it's done, it's dead
Ticky tocky ticky dead
If you feel the need to go
Go, go, won't ya go
They call you a freak show
Welcome to the carnival
Yes, ladies and gentlemen
The wicked clowns will arrive in your town soon
And believe me, it won't be pretty
Justice must be served
To the uncaring selfish wealthy ones
Be prepared and get ready
To catch 400 years of hell
And, oh, one last note to all

Wicked clown is in the house
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Joke your mind, joke your mind
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind

Welcome to the carnival
I can breathe the magic mist
And excell your every wish
Juggla jump from cloud to cloud
Ring them bells, ring them loud
I can breathe the magic mist
And excell your every wish
Juggla jump from cloud to cloud
Ring them bells, ring them loud
I can breathe the magic mist
And excell your every wish
Juggla jump from cloud to cloud
Ring them bells, ring them loud
I can breathe the magic mist
And excell your every wish
Juggla jump from cloud to cloud
Ring them bells, ring them loud
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Joke your mind, joke your mind
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Welcome to the carnival
I can breathe the magic mist
And excell your every wish
Juggla jump from cloud to cloud
Ring them bells, ring them loud
I can breathe the magic mist
And excell your every wish
Juggla jump from cloud to cloud
Ring them bells, ring them loud
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Ring them loud
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Ring them loud
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Ring them loud
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Ring them bells, ring them loud
I can breathe the magic mist
And excell your every wish
Juggla jump from cloud to cloud
Ring them bells, ring them loud
I can breathe the magic mist
And excell your every wish
Juggla jump from cloud to cloud
Ring them bells, ring them loud
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Ring them loud
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Ring them loud
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
Ring them loud
Joke ya, joke ya, joke ya mind
