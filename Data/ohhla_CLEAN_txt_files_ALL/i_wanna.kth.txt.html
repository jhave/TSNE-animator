Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yeah.. two-thousand.. three!
(I wanna play with you baby) Brand new
(Can you touch me? Won't you hold me?) K-double-O-L, Keith
(Can you talk to me? Cause I'm lonely)
(I wanna play with you baby) Yeah..

I used to roll, with girls, down the road
Mack trucks caused country Peterbilts overload
Turnpike in freak mode, kissin at a highway patrol
Haulin platinum and gold, takin chicks to the superbowl
Big freight with big weight
Eight thousand birds smuggled internate while you hate
Four hundred miles, we just ate
State trooper we super we dooper
Watch it when we loop or make the left burn out
And watch the club turn out
I keep it raw on tour, feet stay on the floor
United capital rounds, mega droppin them pounds
Big Hank I roll through with tanks, man droppin them sound
Suckers get played like referee, now you're out of your bounds
I move in territories, areas with scary stories

(I wanna play with you baby)
(Can you touch me? Won't you hold me?)
(Can you talk to me? Cause I'm lonely)
(I wanna play with you baby)

I roll with full tanks I'm ready Eddie Diesel we feel
Texaco and pro go borders down to Mexico
Tech stashed with calico, Cancun trips we flip
Snub-nosed to your lip, girls gyrate boots and hips
We blow down nuttin's here
Slow down catch crews on the ups and lowdown
Big controllin, money foldin
New twist nothin old and comin through custom bust 'em
Greyhound bus ride rush 'em all midrange earthquakes
blow your backseat, amps pre-heat
Girls giggle laugh, hee hee
Cops rollin radars, trucks move with CB's
Switchin more gears, countin G's, blastin CD's
Product on the market make a man behind
the drum machine freeze hear DAT you say please
Raindeer cross the freeway, twenty-two degrees

(I wanna play with you baby)
(Can you touch me? Won't you hold me?)
(Can you talk to me? Cause I'm lonely)
(I wanna play with you baby)

Seventeen the switch-up, sixteen the switch-down
Engine hot, turnin eighteen wheels in the block
Backin up in yo' section, tight with rhyme perfection
Smooth like Teddy Pendergrass, yeah..
.. Think I better let her go, for another T.K.O.
Super trashin tires bone, big rims and Firestone
Speed up and rev up two hundred miles up the turnpike
Comin head up smokin all pipes like big bongs that you like
Don't step to me when I'm on the noiman(?) mike
Watch the rowdy crowd in the mosh pit fight

(I wanna play with you, I wanna lay with you)
(I wanna stay with you, if it's okay with you)
-- I wanna play with you baby
(I want you to come over..)
-- I wanna, play.. with you
(I wanna play with you, I wanna lay with you)
(I wanna stay with you, if it's okay with you)
-- Play, with, you
(with some strawberries, and whip cream)
-- I wanna play with you baby
(I wanna play with you, I wanna lay with you)
(I wanna stay with you, if it's okay with you)
(Will you touch me baby?)
-- Play, with, you ba-by
(Would you lick me baby?)
-- I wanna play with you baby
(I want you up inside me)
-- Ohhh baby, play with me
(Come on baby, come on and give me what I'm waitin for)
-- I wanna play, I wanna play
(Oooh baby, UHHH)
-- I wanna play, I wanna play
(I need it, I want it)
-- I wanna play, I wanna play..
(Ooh baby, uhhh..)
