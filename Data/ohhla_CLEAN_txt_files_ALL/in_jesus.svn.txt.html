[Intro: Kokane]
Soldiers mound up
Charge, Nigga we soldiers

[Sevin]
Ah huh, Yeah, I been checkin the clock
It's time nigga
Let's kick this revolution off
Uh, Uh, Get em, Yeah, Get em, Yeah
Get em, Yeah, Get em, Yeah

[Verse 1: Sevin]
We spittin fire to regain our stature
That's why I'm sick and tired of these gangsta rappers
Homeboy, It ain't a thang to match ya
With or without bling and nice, Jesus Christ gon remain the master
Believe it or not, We move seeds on the block
And you perpetuate the evil in them singles you drop

[Chorus: Sevin]
I came to bang
And get you fake niggaz outta the game

[Verse 2: Sevin]
No doubt, I'm regulating the booth
These uncle tom niggaz miseducating the youth
So it's war now, God give strength to the troops
To tear it all down dawg and replace it with truth
I ain't came to speak ya name, Keep ya fame
I came to make sure the beats'll slang
In Jesus name

[Chorus: Sevin]
I came to bang
And get these weak niggaz outta the game

[Verse 3: Sevin]
Take a bow gangsta? Naw, Get yourself an applause
Another rapper wit a plaque that ain't helpin the cause
I don't care what label you is
Where the songs that'll help single mothers here raisin they kids?
We got a purpose, Don't let the block mislead you
Whether I'm from the gutter, Jesus walks wit me too

[Chorus: Sevin]
I came to bang
And get y'all fake niggaz outta the game

[Verse 4: Sevin]
I bring the guard like freebase, This how the real sound
For the niggaz spellbound by the fact that they hellbound
I ain't tryin to judge nothin, I just feed the fact the flood's comin
Yeah, Niggaz love stuntin, But they'll drown
You ain't like this, Regardless, We came to be righteous
We martyrs, We ready nigga, Aim ya devices

[Chorus: Sevin]
I came to bang
And get y'all fake niggaz outta the game
Yeah

[Verse 5: Kokane]
I came to bang
Ain't nothin gonna change
No pain no gain
It's the kokane
I came to bang
Ain't nothin gonna change
I came to rearrange
In Jesus name

[Sevin]
Move the kane in the game to spark d-day when we
Flip, I ain't trippin if the dj spin me
Don't get at me with that he say she say envy
Niggaz flows is low budget like a e-bay bentley
Do we care how ya blast for cheddar?
Split somethin that'll last forever
Nigga

[Chorus: Sevin]
I came to bang
And get you fake niggaz outta the game

[Verse 6: Sevin]
It's a shame what a nigga would do to cop the bling
Deceive a whole generation for a watch and ring
You think i'ma let you stop the dream that transcends
From the essence of the late great Dr. King?
I don't care if you slang caine, Bang, Or extort souls
Just keep my father's name out ya mouth at award shows

[Chorus: Sevin]
I came to bang
And get you fake niggaz outta the game

[Verse 7: Sevin]
Before you ever see this hog jackin a cruise
Each one of my members gon relax in it too
Disregard, I ain't scared of the clap in the room
I'm wit that, Kick back, Get the activist rule
From dave to job to st. paul to elijah
We ridas, All down to die for the messiah

[Chorus: Sevin]
I came to bang
And get you fake niggaz outta the game

[Kokane]
I came to bang
Ain't nothin gonna change
No pain no gain
It's the kokane
I came to bang
Ain't nothing gonna change
I came to rearrange
In Jesus name

[Outro: Sevin]
Hog mob, Yeah I'm ridin wit it dawg, I told ya
Through sac-town to the mower
From La, Long beach, Compton, Watts
All up north, West coast yeah, We ridin, We ridin
Who we ride fo? Who we ride fo? Who we ride fo?
Hog mob

[Kokane]
In Jesus name</pre>
