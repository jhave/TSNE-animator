Samples: Graffiti vandals can be hard to catch,
It's a huge problem, All out war on graffiti, Two out of every three
cans were stolen out of your typical neighbourhood store,
And what happens to the kids convicted of graffiti offences

Chorus: Crime scene colon these cold streets you patrol on
Trying to get a hold on kids strapped with Krylon

Scratch: Vandal squad on my case
Getting chased raided but mostly getting shit painted
(chorus and scratch 2x)

[Promoe]
Yo, it was me and Suer, right. On a tuesday night
Had green, brown, black, two blue shades and white
Cosm.i.c stayed home but BIF crew stay tight
Staking out the steel dragon for a true spray fight
In other words a backjump
Wishing that we wouldn't bumb into them wack chumps
Cause the lay-ups getting crowded after sunset
Which is cool but get in line cause it ain't your fucking turn yet
Gotta burn shit can't come up with no lame style piece
If you wanna tame the wild beast
Had better burn murder the red worm spread germs in the system
to make heads turn
And snap necks at the central stations
Young kids making cops run like mental patients
Don't they know that graffiti can't be stopped
Writers unlike rappers can't go pop
So they stay underground till the day graff is legalized
Civil eyes look upon us as evil guys
Though we trod one away on third rails in front of metal giants
Death defiant to cops we keep lying
In the bushes ambushes being plotted clean trains being spotted
signed like there was dotted
Lines on the sides of the iron monsters
Representing VK mafia, call us bombsters

Sample: This is what the detectives are gonna consider a bombing.
Were they take a specific chunk of a neighbourhood and they
absolutely destroy it.

Chorus: Crime scene colon these cold streets we patrol on
Trying to get a hold on kids strapped with Krylon

Chorus: Crime scene colon, these cold streets you patrol on

They just run off like we were teflon by the blink of an eye they gone
Didn't fit in the soccer team as kids so they started out wrong
That makes sence thats why they started to bomb
Behind bars is were they really belong
It's like a life style for these teens they all wear hooded sweatshirts
Listen to rap music move in criminal networks
They're mainly from the suburbs socially dysfunctional
A young graffiti writer soon a fullfeathered criminal
Our chances are minimal to lead 'em back to the right side of the track
They refer to legal as wack
They lack respect for authority, for taxpayers
Their own parents pay this it's about the papers
They're supposed to be decent yes sayers
but now they trash like punkrocks and ravers
Hellraisers raised by failures and fools
What we need are some rules in the public schools
If this make us look bad and by the end of the day
That's what really matters the people in charge say
They need the public to believe everything's working all right
What they don't know won't hurt them right
I mean on one hand it's not that dangerous but it
looks bad on the other
And the voters are stupid they judge the book by it's cover

Chorus: Crime scene colon these cold streets we patrol on
Trying to get a hold on kids strapped with Krylon

Sample: Establish a graffiti unit to combat the problem
Crack down on graffiti

Chorus: Crime scene colon these cold streets we patrol on
Trying to get a hold a hold on kids strapped with Krylon

[Cosm.i.c]
You trying to get a hold on us kids strapped with Krylon
But for too long people believed in your fiction
That graffers came from broken homes with drug addictions
Get the picture it's a mixture of four ingredients
Kept alive by cats who truly believe in them
I won't be naming them but this one in this time
Is still non-sellout maybe that's why it's still a crime
How many real graff writers we got here tonight?
Pump your fist for what you believe is right
These northern light emcee characters won't take any shit from suckers
with pockets packed with badges
Still the baddest in any weather in any season
Whether political or for the fuck of it reasons
Teasing society like a spot in your rear
This generation heroes nightshift volunteers

Chorus: Crime scene colon these cold streets you patrol on
Trying to get a hold on kids strapped with Krylon

Chorus: Crime scene colon these cold streets you patrol on
Trying to get a hold on kids strapped with Belton

Scratch: Getting chased, raided but mostly getting shit painted
Ey yo, graff can't be faded

Sample: Kids don't think that graffiti is a crime. 
They need to understand that personal property belongs to other people, 
and they don't have the right to damage it</pre>
