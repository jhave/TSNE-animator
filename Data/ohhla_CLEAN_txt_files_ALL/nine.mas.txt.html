[3D]
I'm a little curious of you in crowded scenes
And how serene your friends and fiends
We flew and strolled as two eliminated gently
Why don't you close your eyes and reinvent me

[Daddy G]
You know you've got that heart made of stone
You should have let me know
You could have let me know

[3D]
We'll go 'till morning comes
And traffic grows
And windows hum

[Daddy G]
Speding all week with your friends
Give me evenings and weekends
Evenings and weekends

[3D]
I could be yours
We can unwind
All these have flaws
All these have flaws

You'd agree it's a typical high
You fly as you watch your name go by
And once the name goes by
Not thicker than water nor thicker than mud
And the eight k thuds it does

Sunset so thickly
Let's make it quiet and quickly
Don't frown
It taste's better on the way back down

I could be yours
We can unwind
All these have flaws
All these have flaws
All these have flaws
Will lead to mine

We can unwind
All these have flaws
All these have flaws
Will lead to mine
Will see to
All these have flaws
All these have flaws
Will see to
All these have flaws
Will lead to mine
We can unwind all our flaws
We can unwind all our flaws</pre>
