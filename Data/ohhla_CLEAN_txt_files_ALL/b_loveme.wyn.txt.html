[Intro/Chorus: Future] + (Drake)
I'm on that good kush and alcohol {Mike Will Made It...}
I got some down bitches I can call - what's happenin'?
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'mma ball til the day I fall - ball, ball, ball
(Yeah, long as my bitches love me) yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah
(I can give a fuck 'bout no hater long as my bitches love me) yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah
{EarDrummers} (Uh, I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas long as these bitches love me)

[Lil Wayne]
Uhh, pussy ass nigga stop hatin'
Lil Tunechi got that fire and these hoes love me like Satan, maaaan
Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick, she's on a strict diet, that's my baby
With no make-up she a ten
And she the best with that head, even better then Karrine
She don't want money; she want the time we could spend
She said "Cause I really need somebody, so tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said "I never want to make you mad, I just want to make you proud"
I said "Baby just make me cum, then don't make a sound"
Lil Tunechi

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Uhh, real nigga fuck these haters
These hoes got pussies like craters, can't treat these hoes like ladies, maaaan
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine; I hope my name taste like sardines, to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed - 69, 96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest to chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down, I'm arrestin' this bitch
All my bitches love me and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes names, but then I would be snitching
And these haters try to knock me but they can't knock me off the hinges
It's Lil Tunechi

[Chorus] - minus last eight words

[Lil Wayne] 
I lost a few good bitches, met some more bad bitches
And I be schoolin' them niggas - pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hatin'...
I'm gettin' ass or I'm skatin'... yeah
I lost a few good bitches, met some more bad bitches
And I be schoolin' them niggas - pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hatin'...
I'm gettin' ass of I'm skatin'... bitch
