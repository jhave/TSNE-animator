[Intro]
Waddup, Midwest?
THey forgot about the fourth coast
Uh, it ain't nuttin though
Waddup Arkansas, Minnesota, Kansas
Kentucky, Missouri, everybody in the Lou'!

[Verse 1ne]
Geah! (HOLLA!)
Thinkin 'bout Guy Fisher 
Never met him, but goddamn thats my nigga!        (why?)
I figure real estate, invested pie flipper 
Never snitch, me Im in a bathrobe, fly slippers   (high 80s')
Left Chicago wit good money for five drops 
Westside, did the Southside like the White Sox    (Waddup Stony Island?)
Bamboo and Pulaski, K-town is contra (Westside)
Theyll dearly depart ya, in front of MacArthurs (Waddup Madison?)
Im the author for gangsters, tough guys 
Did the whole Ohio, but I start it off of Buckeye (dey know me!)
Columbus to 'Natti, them towns I raped 'em        (sure did) 
Few clowns was hatin (what?!), moved my pounds to Dayton (Let's go)
And in Akron, my niggaz they would throw things 
Not King James, these were coke kings            (Buck, waddup baby?)
Ain't he actin grown, doggy you ain't back at home 
Then smack the {?}, wrapped in chrome, you better get a chaperone

[Chorus w/ ad-libs in background]
If you know like I know, you should lie low 
Killa, I used to get it in Ohio 
Dont forget the Chi though, guns are like a pyro 
You keep playin, you will look like a gyro

[Verse 2wo]
Yo, ga'head and hate me hater 
'cause Im flyer than a aviator? (Yes I am)
Well, youll get SMACKED with the radiator
And I get catered player - wanna talk? Maybe later 
Told her, her time was up, '88 her, Flavor Flaved her (Boyeeeee!)
Need ya neck choked, rather your neck broke 
Ya dead broke, yet folks the jewels are like AIYYO!!
And youll get yolked up, switchblade poked up 
Bitch-made since sixth grade, he need his rope cut (yes)
Cowboy roped up, yall boys sold what? 
Know what? The dope, crack, and coke is in the coat tucked  (right here)
Roll up, hold up, family, this a hold up! 
Get close up, soaked up, Im KG, postup
Hoe, slut, no love, turn beef to cold cuts 
Family gettin bread, well he about to get his loaf cut (in half)
Yall doped up, this game is sewed up 
Malcolm X tell the white bitch yo, I want my toes sucked

[Chorus]

[Verse 3hree]
Yo, Id rather be judged by twelve, than carried by six
My twelve and twelve - well, they carry my bricks 
and them twelve-twelve fiends, theyre married to sniff
And the V12, that's on various trips {*laughing*}
Yall make a brotha laugh, me I took another path 
Come into my habitat, hover crafts, bubble baths 
Duffle bags stuffed with cash, fell in love with math
I got the green Benz, red Range, mustard Jag
White coke, tan dope, black gun, trey deuce
Silver bullets, purple piff, blue pills, Grey Goose
Pull out the rat-tat-tat (what you say?)
Duck duck, say goose 
Beige coupe, suede roofs, send him off to Jesús (Jesus)
H-deuce, yea yea, piss off the state troops 
See me, then they don't, I disappear, say POOF!
Play Zeus, homeboy get a replaced tooth 
Not pot, mean dust when a nigga say juice 
Killa! Killa..

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You know what it is, nigga - Harlem 
140th &amp; Lennox, you faggot niggaz can suck a dick, fuck niggaz
Everybody in the whole Midwest, Indiana
Nebraska - Omaha, what's happenin?
Err'body in Denver, Iowa, Illinois
Chi-Town, Ohio, you know what it is
I'll be home soon, Killa!
Milwaukee, Wisconsin
Waddup, Leche?
Yo Happy, I'ma drop another package off
Duke on that Westside of Chicago [*laughs*]
Waddup everybody in Columbus? [*fades*]</pre>
