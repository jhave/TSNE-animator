[Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, yeah, yeah..
Slammin! Drugs got me wakin up in cold sweats
Sometimes I'm slightly off my rocker, but I'm on deck
Got two and a baby off my bitch's student loan check
She hit my line to get that girl I call it phone sex
Robbin like my problems ain't gon' catch up to me later
Bitch I'm mobbing like O.G. Bobby Johnson, split your potato
Every table, cookin shavin and touchin base with them basers
Bet they try to make a play for the yay' as soon as they taste it
The amazin black American Gangster, sinister corner hugger
Seein this nigga shine been annoyin me like a muh'fucker
This busta owe me, now he act like he don't know me
Forty fo' my closest homie, kill cock-a-aroaches like Tony
Got Montana money
You bought 100, dipped in fluid, yo I had to smoke it
Pupils dilated like silver dollars, now we kno-ckin
Call it devilish how I do bitch
Fuck these niggaz talkin, I leave they thoughts on my shoestrings
What? Uhh, yeah
Ah f'sho, yeah

[Freddie Gibbs]
Rollin; pockets all swollen
Set the record straight that FNH is what I'm holdin
A busta that we know got 15 'bows, bust it open
We came bandana'd up, divide it up, now what's the quotient?
A split with 4 niggaz, since I'm a go getter
I think these suckers pussy, I'ma merk the whole litter
Told my girl to leave as soon as I hung up the phone with her
Man I heard you rob the robbers, look Freddie a cold nigga
Got an ice maker for a heart, made nigga from the start
Life is like a movie, all I did was play my fuckin part
+Cheffin'+ up the crack, the heroin, and weed a la carte
I call it Fast Freddie's, I should own a fuckin restaurant
Cause back when I was 12 threw some bells on a scale and I got a pager
We broke 'em down and started selling nickels to the neighbors
Eventually the penitentiary gon' see me later
Kiss my momma told her if I die then it was part of nature
What?

[Raekwon]
+28 Days Later+ we all gettin fresh
Got the heart to die for somethin, flesh to flesh
The Lambo got her outside, it's a stretch
My bitch half Mexican/Afghan I'm blessed
From living tough times with rough lemons, a gorgeous watch
My team on a dreadful level yo
Yeah, we still gettin money right?
Long as the sun come out, I'll hold these twenties tight
Getting fresh, just coolin, my bitch on my dick
But boom yo, you live with your moms, just get a grip
Clip in my pocket, a rocket
I think of the +Dips+, I need Juelz and Jims with rough licks
Trips to Africa, shorty tear Saks up
I'm out in Bombay, rebels here actin up
We real, all G, 7500 of us
Up in the Sprinter bus, fussin "We need more heat"</pre>
