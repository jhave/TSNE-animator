Nicki Minaj
Your such a BARBIE

[Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo
Mariah I was in them million dollar meetings, he was cheatin'
All up in the church, he was sneakin' with the deacon
Cats away, well the mice will play
LOL smiley face, have a nice day
Cause POP POP POP, it goes my rubber band
So STOP STOP STOP, sniffin' that contraband
Cause you was penny pinchin' my accounts laced
Attentionnnn, about face

[Mariah Carey]
I thought we had something special
We had something good
But I should have had another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walking by you
Boy don't you even speak
Pretend you on the sofa
And I'm on the TV
Might see me on a poster
See me at a show
But you won't see me for free
Boy this ain't no promo

[Bridge]
In all shame now
Where ever you been laying
You can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep calling from your mama's house

[Chorus]
When I break, I break boy
[Up out my face boy] [x4]
When I break
[Up out my face boy] [x4]
When I break

You ain't never gonna feel this thing again
You gon' get alot of calls
Cause I CC-ed at your friends
(Laugh)
I ain't walkin' around no more
Feeling sad, that ain't even my bad baby
I break, when I break, I break
MARIAHHH

So look who's crying now, BOO HOO HOO
Talking 'bout you missing your BOO HOO HOO
Oh no you ain't gettin' it
I know you ain't hittin' it
No you ain't a rapper, so you need to stop spittin' it
HA,HA,HA,HA,HA
You wondering who I'm messing while you ain't next to me
HA,HA,HA,HA,HA
So pay the consequences cause you acted all ignorant

[Bridge]
You ashame now
Where ever you been laying you can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep calling from your mama's house
When I break, I break

[Nicki Minaj]
Yo, stylin' on them big B's
Bought the Benz out
Elevator, press P for the Pent House
Top doe's, we break like tacos
Roscoe's, on his knees wit a snot-nose
They be like she next
Kawasaki T-Rex
Give em' some Kleenex
Match his little V-Necks
Oh that's what he left?
Let his mama pick it up
Might back up on it, VROOM VROOM wit the pick-up truck
That blue and yellow, yeah that's the Carmelo Jag
I bob and weave em'
Hit em' wit that Mayweather JAB
I get the thumbs up, like I'm hailing a yellow cab
My flow nuts like M&amp;M's in the yellow bag
MARIAHHH

When I break I break I break
And no super glue can fix this shit
When I break I break I break
Not even a welder and a builder could rebuild this shit
When I break I break I break
Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic
Can fix this when I break, I break
If we were two Lego blocks
Even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010
Couldn't put us back together again
When I break [Laughs]
UP OUT MY FACE BOY

[Nicki Minaj in the background]
Better go back to yo mama's house
I told you, I put, I put his stuff on the sidewalk
and roll over every nook and cranny with a pickup truck like
like straight up and down I am Nicki Manij cant say "s" about me
