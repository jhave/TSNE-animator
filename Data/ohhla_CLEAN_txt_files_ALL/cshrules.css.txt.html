[Intro]
Yeah! Full Surface nigga!
Cassidy nigga
Cassidy (E-V-E) and Bone Thugs
Cassidy (E-V-E) and Bone Thugs

[Cassidy]
Yo to get the cash, I get the mask
My trigger finger itch, so I'm quick to blast
I'm quick to spaz, I'll strip your ass
Today a bullet in a clip hit your ass
Nigga this Bone and Mr. Cash
Niggaz on my dick like you whipped the cats
Niggaz never heard me spit this fast
Got niggaz on the strip if you hit the glass
(Yo switch it Cass!) I can change the flow
Yo, you the type of cat give my name to po'-po'
You a rat, you a lame with no dough
Push your wig back when I bang the fo'-fo'
I grip it and blast for it
Nigga you can get it if you axe for it
I can spit it in fast forward
{Screwed: *Or I can go in slower*}
Chop and screw it, have the whole Midwest rockin to it
Have the whole down South snappin to it
Get the whole East coast back into it, I'm the cat to do it
Whole West coast gon' bang to this
I do this for my niggaz with 'cane to pitch
They never should have let me get the hang of this
Now I'ma spit game so dangerous
I'm amazin homes, I raise the chrome
Put the lazer on, then blaze the chrome
Better never fuck with Lazy Bone
Can't forget Wish and Krayzie Bone
And best believe that if you fuck with Eve I'm gonna kill you
I rep to the death, F to the S, man it don't get no realer

[Chorus 2X: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me {*3X*}
Cash rules everything around me

[Krayzie Bone]
Nigga better listen to the warnin, run up on a nigga
He'll die and won't nobody find him 'til the mornin
Believe me we ain't scared to put it on ya
Leave you in a field in the Killa Califonia
Nigga make money, get money, big money
Casue when a motherfucker broke ain't shit funny - you can believe
Cash rule everything around me
So don't bring yo' broke ass around me
Spitter, nigga wig out, for the scrilla
Killer, dollar billa
In the middle of the drama
I'ma be goin inside yo' pocket, for the profit
So drop it nigga this Cass' and Bone
Light up some hash and pass the chrome
Any nigga with a misunderstandin gon' get handled
And that's fo' sho'

[Wish Bone]
Nigga shut it down, we don't fuck around
If a nigga disrespect make him lay down
Used to get it in the street now I'm raised up
Nigga lay face ddown, nigga give me that shit
What I'm 'posed to do, when the niggaz ride through
with his money, I want it
All I'm tryin to say is been doin this stuff
They fakers don't want it
Hit hard, droppin bodyguards
You don't want what's over here
Nigga better watch your broad, cause she'll tell it all
And we'll bring it over there
Nigga this Bone and Cass' who can fuck with that
If a nigga goes down, ain't nobody gon' rat
We know that, cut 'em all in the face
Whole camp on hush, that's always

[Chorus]

[Lazy Bone]
Better give me my money mayne, I ain't runnin game
Me and Lil Cass' like one in the same
We want it, we need it, you better believe it
And if you ain't got it we gunnin mayne
I ain't askin twice, I never been that nice
Hoe niggaz been killed for a game of dice
He come sho't on the debt and he paid the price
Stayin at home with a safety light
But you chose to gamble, Mr. Rambo
Nigga like that get made example
I'ma tell you like a Biggie sample
Come short on the dough get your contract canceled
I'm up out first with pleny of ammo
This Full Surface nigga hard to handle
Nigga run up bet he get dismantled
Got him glued to the tube, can't change the channel

[Eve]
I was born to be a rich bitch
Can't ever block me from this dough
Nigga ridiculous
Yeah you see me, Hermes head to toe
You want to witness, you can't stop me, pop on the jet
Headed to Paris for a hour just to cop me a dress
You call it crazy, well I call it life
And I'm makin sure I'm all good
Nigga it's hard to rich, fuck broke
I remember that bein in the hood
And I ain't never goin back, fuck that
Got too much in life I want and need
Yeah you haters we love it and love it
Cassidy, Bone and Eve, yeah~!

[Chorus]
