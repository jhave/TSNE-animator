[Intro: Alexx (Bay-C)]
La la la la la la la la la la (T.O.K.)
Yeah yeah yeah (Definetly for the ladies) yeah yeah yeah
Tell me (But girlfriend yuh haffi mek mi know)
Tell me what you want me to do (Mi love yuh yuh see weh mi seh)
(Let me know) Yeah yeah yeah (Let me know)

[Chorus: Alexx &amp; Flexx (Craigy T)]
Tell me (Tell me, tell me, tell me weh yuh waan)
If you still care, about me (Ribidy bibidy bibidy bibidy bomb skang)
Tell me (Ah ah ah) if you still care, about me
If you feel the same way too

[Verse 1: Bay-C]
Just like how mi and har deh par we use to be di perfect pair
Then like a magic trick di love just stop and disappear
Mi would a give yuh anyting fi show yuh just how much mi care
But if you don't care girl I'm outta here
Mi nah nuh time fi play nuh game mi nah nuh time fi galevant
Mi can fly around di world and get any gal mi waan
So listen mi lyrics weh mi utta listen mi melody mi chant
Tell me what you want, cool

[Chorus: Alexx &amp; Flexx (Craigy T)]
Tell me (Tell me what you want)
If you still care, about me (Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Tell me (Ribidy bibidy bibidy bibidy bomb skang) if you still care, about me
If you feel the same way too

[Verse 2: Craigy T]
Bay gal yuh know yuh pretty like a roseland
From yuh heel to yuh pedicure toes and
Happy dat yuh chose mi out to possibly a thousand
But I have to let yuh know di lifestyle yuh chosen
Yuh see I'm a man weh always ovaseas
Always a hustle and a secure mi g's
Bare ten outta ten girls dem surround mi
But it nuh matta from mi waan yuh and yuh waan mi so

[Chorus: Alexx &amp; Flexx (Craigy T)]
Tell me (Ribidy bibidy bibidy bibidy bomb skang)
If you still care, about me (Tell me, tell me, tell me weh yuh waan)
Tell me (Go so then) if you still care, about me
If you feel the same way too

[Bridge: Flexx]
I'm not lookin for a girl, to be the only one in my world
All I wanna do is have some fun and then come back to you
I'm not lookin for a girl, to be the only one in my world
All I wanna do is have some fun and then come back to you

[Chorus: Alexx &amp; Flexx (Craigy T)]
Tell me (Tell me, tell me, tell me weh yuh waan)
If you still care, about me (So mi go so weh mi juggle so mi go so then)
Tell me (Tell mi weh yuh waan) if you still care, about me
If you feel the same way too
Tell me (Go so then) if you still care, about me (Ah ah ah)
Tell me (Ribidy bibidy bibidy bibidy bomb skang) if you still care, about me
If you feel the same way too</pre>
