[Intro]

Sup Fred?
Gangsta shit
West Coast...

[Verse One]

Niggas with hepatitis
Unauthorized hard-to-move arthritis 
Infected selected neglected ejected
And next time ya hit the West
You could best believe, believe the best, mothaFUCK the rest
What you supposed to be snatchin'?
You comin' to a world of punctured hearts and jackin'
Lethal illegal overseein' the [??] be like seagulls 
Balls in ya jaws on the hunt like bald eagles 
The end of the sequel
I'm the milli-mac and the strong-end and nigga to blame you
And I'mma start callin' ya'll bitch niggas by name:

Mothafuck D
Mothafuck M
Only X I know is Xzibit or RBX
Extraordinary, trynna snatch my bitch
You can have the bitch, two bitches gettin' rich
Just to come to the West Coast and get stripped down
Beat to death and stripped, all over a bitch
Now it's 50 MC's that ain't worth shit
Get ya ass kicked 50 times, beat to 10 cent
I love New York, but the niggas that represent, ya'll ain't shit New York
They actin' like a bitch New York
Buckshot, Noreaga, Jigga - cool
Canibus, Wu-Tang, my niggas - cool
Def Squad and DefJam, but fuck Ja Rule
Irv Gotti I can't wait for Raekwon to break fool
Trynna sign Daz, nigga Daz ll sign you
And when you hit the West, this is what we gon' do:

Get ya'll niggas, slap ya'll niggas like bitches
Dippin' through the hood on switches
I just bought me a Cadillac last week
Wit' a new bitch since my old bitch tweaked
Naw homeboy, the game just ain't the same
If you wanna know, Kurupt said it, and I'm Callin' Out Names

[Break]

*scratching* "Never did like him" 
"You know what?" *scratching* "Fuck, fuck, fuck all ya'll"

[Chorus: Kurupt, (Xzibit), <dr. dre="">]

"It's for my niggas and my bitches, 
my bitches and all my niggas, my niggas and
my bitches, my bitches and all my niggaaaass!"

Callin' Out Names!

(Now if it wasn't for the West, 
these rap niggas wouldn't need a vest around they chest)

<it and="" like="" that="" this="">

[Verse 2]

I don't give a fuck
Catch me in da hood all blue Chucks, gangbanged the fuck out Cuz
Only thing I like that Ryde Ruff is Eve
And all the rest of ya'll niggas who Ryde Ruff get these
I'mma tell you one mo' time and I won't say it again
Kurupt said it mothafucka from beginnin' to end
You salamander-ass caterpillar-ass mothafucka
Fake-ass busta-ass fake killa mothafucka
If it wasn't for the West, 
these rap niggas wouldn't need a vest for they chest
Quoted from a fucka homie X
The Lox ya'll my mothafuckas, can't forget ya'll
And that's spoken on from the mothafuckin Dogg
All the rest of ya'll, tell ya like this
Eat a fat dick bitch
I'm Callin Out Names!

[Break]

Fuck Ruff Ryder
Fuck The Firm
Fuck Belly

Kurupt says fuck em

[Chorus]

Nigga, now if I didn't say yo name, then this ain't for you
But if you try to speak then I'mma peel the paint for you
I cause brain tumors, thinkin' of a thought to think
Lettin' off caliber's til the chamber need to be changed
Empty out, simply don't tempt me, 
I empty out until everything in this mothafucka's gone
I empty house off of empty rounds
Now what the fuck you gotta say?
What the fuck you wanna see? The homie's on my K
I never worry bout none of ya'll so why now?
I run it through and this is how you do it Dogg Pound (ROOF!)
The Gang, we master blast and maintain
Weed money cocaine got us all insane
Bitch niggas remember even though the times may change
I want Kurupt said it nigga, and I'm Callin' Out Names

[Break]
*scratching* "Never did like him" 
"You know what?" *scratching* All ya'll! "Fuck, fuck, fuck all ya'll"

[Chorus: Kurupt, (Xzibit), <dr. dre="">]

"It's for my niggas and my bitches, 
my bitches and all my niggas, my niggas and
my bitches, my bitches and all my niggaaaass!"
