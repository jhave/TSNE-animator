(Here we go again, baby) Here we go again; fuckin right!
Dark Man X baby, dog for life, for life, for life...
"When I say D, M; y'all say X!"
"D, M!" (Crowd:  X!)
"D, M!" (Crowd:  X!)
"When I say D, M; y'all say X!"
"D, M!" (Crowd:  X!)
"D, M!" (Crowd:  X!)
"When I say D, M; y'all say X!"
"D, M!" (Crowd:  X!)
"D, M!" (Crowd:  X!)
"When I say D, M; y'all say X!"
"D, M!" (Crowd:  X!)
"D, M!" (Crowd:  X!)

[DMX]
I don't fuck with what you sayin 'cause your raps weak
I take the back streets of New York, and run a track meet
To form life from a rap sheet
See that be the flow that's crushin 'em on the L
Jumpin on they fuckin shit, bustin 'em 'til they swell
Then tell, your mother, next time she see her son is never
And I be on yo' dick, if my name was "No Pussy".. ever
Like "The Hulk," but they can't fix me
"Doom, doom, doom, doom, doom," and sly like Bill Bixby
This should be havin niggaz in the emergency
Undergoing surgery, wanting to murder me
When you go, you know you heard of me
And yo' last thought is what you did wasn't worth ya life
It's what yo' ass bought
Caught up in some shit, and I had to let you feel this steel
They found his faggot ass slumped over the steering wheel
You still feeling real? Naw nigga you looking tired
Gone on to sleep baby, 'cause yo' shit is just expired
"When I say D, M; y'all say X!"
"D, M!" (Crowd:  X!)
"D, M!" (Crowd:  X!)
"When I say D, M; y'all say X!"
"D, M!" (Crowd:  X!)
"D, M!" (Crowd:  X!)</pre>
