[Intro: Lil B]
Nigga fireworks
See that's what it is huh?
5150 fuck with me
Like I said nigga, we taking it to that next level...
Lil B for Lil Boss
I Forgive You mixtape, I don't hold no grudges
5150, 3130 - 5150 fuck with me my nigga
You know what it be like man
Lil B in this muthafucka man
Shout out to the made niggas

Hating on my line, bitch I had to knock em back
Then I grip the duct tape, and tell em go get that
Now pump, knock the shit back
Niggas wanna hate I tell em I ain't even with that
Get money shit is what I'm on - is you with that?
Niggas wanna play, but this is not a game bitch
Clip on the Mack and I ain't even gotta use it
These niggas wanna hate me - pass the AK please!
Stuff em in the trunk, that's based to your face
Real hot boy for real, I got case on top of case
And I don't know Queen Latifah
But I set it off with the 9 in the freezer
Got the baggy-bag, leave em right where I need em
Leave em fakes down, have em plank on this evening
189 is what they say when they grieving
187 ain't shit bitch this evening
I'm a mass up cause the army all ready
Big thangs because I'm working already
I'm a be self-made, deeper than the game
You better know my name, I'm geeked off the fame
Worldwide Based God, come and ride the train
That AK [?]
Not my MO, but I take a picture - snap!
That boy just flashed
100 bitch - for real mayn

[Chorus]
You niggas live for real, you got fake beef?
I can't respect you bitch - I'm in the streets

Respect my mind, respect my words
Came straight off the Porsche bitch, respect my nerves
Came straight off the dome with no [?] speeches
That nigga talk shit but he's down to eat it
I don't never talk shit, I'm not about the beefing
Got shit on my mind for no reason
I'm a hold it down all 12 seasons
I run the block like NFL muthafuckin seasons
You snitching bitch, I flip the switch
I don't whine, I don't cry
I wine and dine
Got 10 new whips and designer tires
[?] if he hate on me
If he whine about taxes but that K free
Nigga just hate for publicity
I don't [?] bitch, I run the world
Only unsigned nigga with a million girls
Based God!</pre>
