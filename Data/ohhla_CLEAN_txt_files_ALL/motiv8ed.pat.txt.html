(Intro, Project Pat)
Yeah man, this go out to all those who hated on the real
Ya know I'm sayin, I'ma put it to ya like this right here, man
The truth shall survive, ya know I'm sayin

But'chu needa get up on ya somethin, ya know I'm sayin
I mean, ya know, good always overcomes evil, man you know
And to all real guys out here man, thats handlin ya business
All my brothers, brown, black, white, all accross America
All ya gotta do man, is just uhh, put God first, ya know I'm sayin
And you shall shine, ya know I'm sayin?
Aye man, word to the wise and to the lame

(Hook, Project Pat)
Motivated by the haters, motivated by the haters

(Verse 1, Project Pat)
Here I goes on my hustle playin
Niggas know that I stay
Down on this money man, this is do or die
Hater's mouths be runnin
But the bills still comin
Either you gon' lay it down
Or you get up on ya somethin
Bein broke is a joke
Very hazardous to health
I don't sell no dope
Playa, dope sell it's self
Gotta floss in my wealth
If ya got it, then show it
Twenty-thousand at the Lennox Mall, I'ma blow it
Petrone, I'ma pour it
Purp, I'ma roll it
Gun to ya head, squeeze triggas, brains blowin
Hood nigga from the North side, Memphis Tennessee
Tatted on my left arm, spelled like Hennessey

(Hook)

(Project Pat)
Yeah, this go out to all you niggas in the streets
Who don't know what'cha doin

(Verse 2, Project Pat)
Fe-fi-fo-fum, you can feel the slugs
Of this Mossburg shotgun, chest full of blood
You can say that'cha life could end in a flash
Like the wind blows dead brown leaves to the grass
I ain't goin back to jail, when it's on then I shoot
Momma, get'cha black vest on and a body-suit
Meet him at the altar, don't forget'cha flower basket
Full of Holy water, dead in a casket
I'm a basket, of a case
Either them, either me
Dyin all that older
If you go, so it be
See these niggas, they be hatin when ya flossin
Got the bread, I'm just blessed out hurr
And I gotta stay

(Hook)

I'm motivated by the haters
I'm motivated by the haters
I'm motivated by the haters
I'm motivated by the haters
I'm motivated by the haters
I'm motivated by the haters</pre>
