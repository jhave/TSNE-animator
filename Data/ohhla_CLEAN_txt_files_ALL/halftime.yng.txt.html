People all over the world jump
Everybody in the bleachers get crunk
Listen here buddy this ain't what you want
Blue fifty-two, break, duck
DY go left while I'm fakin' the K
When I'm done you gonna remember my name

Look I'm Homebwoi
Now that I'm up in my zone boy
Pack up I'm sendin' you home boy
Take you up outta the dome boy
If you did'nt know you should of known boy
Should've thought about changin your tone boy
Better not let us catch you alone boy
Crack heads like we made of stone boy
When we come out you better be gone boy

[Chorus]
