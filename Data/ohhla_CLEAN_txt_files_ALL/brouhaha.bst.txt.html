Now what the blood clot I rap a lot
What you gonna do when the beat goes drop?
Whatcha talkin' 'bout Willis? Who the illest?
You know my name's Adam stop callin' me Phyllis
Ya hear some fuss, you're like what's the clamor?
It's just me naked on the cover of Glamour
A phenomenon pandemonium
The club is blowing up like plutonium
What's all the fanfare what's the to do
We're known to bring the hullabaloo
On stage or at the spa
Guaranteed we bring the brouhaha

'Cause it's a brouhaha
'Cause it's a brouhaha

There's a commotion that's goin' down
I talk more shit then drown the clown
I'm like that freak from Cirque de Soleil
With my leg behind my head and a rhyme to say
Ten nine eight seven six five four
Get upon the mic and I'm a even the score
one two three, three to two one
don't carry a knife and I don't carry a gun
Yo we be making mountains out of Cool Whip
Pass me the mint for the julep
Tell me everybody where is the love
Hey yo what's the motherfuckin' hubbub

'Cause it's a brouhaha
'Cause it's a brouhaha

Communicator check one two one two
This is Bones McCoy on a line to Sulu
Set the bullshit to warp factor one
Check your tri-corder set your phaser to stun
Oh mai oui you can catch me
At Jean Vie with a pastry
C'est ci c'est la oh n'est pas
Qu'est-ce-que c'est le brouhahaha
Ha haha haha!
Just back from Japan and ooh I'm laggin'
Goin' rao rao with the dungeon dragon
You can dance if you want to leave your friends behind
But if they don't dance and then they won't dance
they can kiss my fuckin' ass
'Cause it's a brouhaha
'Cause it's a brouhaha</pre>
