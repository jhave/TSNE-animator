Hahaha, it's all real, it's Lost Boyz baby

(Mr. Cheeks)
Yo, yo, yo a nigga like me is in this here rap game
Niggaz actin like Mr. Cheeks ain't the same 
But first of all I make cash moves outta state 
And I can't help but if my shit is tryin to go platinum
Lately, you see my team is X-rated 
Ah, the deal, peoples know how I feel
I still love my family and friends 
Just because I'm bouncin in and out of state, and we collectin ends 
They think shit has change, like up the words 
Psst, this is some ex shit that sounds absurd 
I be spendin cash on everybody I know (I KNOW)
So don't act like I know 

(Chorus: Mr. Cheeks)
This is how we do 
Represent for my fam and crew 
My man Bink got that shit that makes me smoke and drink
We tickle bitches pink, bring the feathers
Yeah everybody we know how we do 
Everyday we smoke, we drink the brew 
Bounce with the peoples that love to have fun 
We've been getting down since Day 1
Everybody just know how we do
Everyday we smoke and we drink the brew
Bounce with the crews that love to have fun 
We've been getting down since Day 1

(Mr. Cheeks)
Yo, yo, yo my brothers Freaky Tah you be getting high 
And that's, no mother, fuckin lie 
Until the day I die, I'ma always puff lye
Niggaz, take care of people, still some tough guys 
Yeah, yeah you right, I run with my mens
We be in the caravan countin up the Trans kid 
Or sold the fifty dollar bill
We be givin competition, your motherfuckin cheddar's
Fuck what you wear, rap ain't about rappin about your clothes 
No wooly I suppose that you're ill
Kid I gotta, see your skill, I got that 
shit to pay the rent and shit to pay the bills 
So yo, stop the maddest, my crews not the baddest 
I tuck em in the night craner, blood rollin
We can't fuck with no glasses
(SO YO, WHAT'S WITH THOSE SHORTIES YO
YO THOSE CORNERS &amp; THOSE REGULARS, WORD UP)
bring the corpses, yeah

(Chorus: Mr. Cheeks)
Everybody know how we do 
Everyday we smoke, we drink the brew 
Bounce with the peoples that love to have fun 
We've been getting down since Day 1
Everybody just know how we do
Everyday we smoke, we drink the brew
Bouncin with my people that love to have fun 
We've been getting down since Day 1

(Mr. Cheeks)
Be the star of your show, show be your star
I rip niggaz when I come to the bar
Order me a JD, niggaz lookin shady 
at me and my team and my main ladies 
Stop that, you need to just chill
See I'm that nigga with the real rap skill
I'ma drop a bomb and I, stay calm and I 
even if I handle fire alarm
Cause I stay in situations
Niggaz be fuckin with only food dilations
That's all around town, we get down 
First of all, you best to make a call and I'll, I'll
be, comin, aiyyo I got this mans spot 
you should've filled up drummin 
My man Bink make me wanna bounce 
Puff on the lye and drink a forty-ounce
One more time now

(Chorus: Mr. Cheeks)
Everybody know how we do 
Everyday we smoke and drink the brew 
Bounce with the people that love to have fun 
We've been getting down since Day 1
Everybody just know how we do
Everyday we smoke and we drink the brew
Bounce with my people that love to have fun 
We've been getting down since Day 1 

(Outro: Mr. Cheeks)
Word up, shit that's your own fuckin, move us 
KnowI'msayin, e'rybody that's livin
All my niggaz that's locked down keeps ya fightin 
Word up, gotta keep it tight, like this one time 
We represent Queens it's NYC representers
Yo, yo Queens Most wanted is in the house 
My man Rob, he's in the house
