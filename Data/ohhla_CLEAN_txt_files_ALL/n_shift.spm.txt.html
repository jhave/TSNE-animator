[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
Now spread the word
I got them bricks on the dead end streets
And watch them jump out boys, cause they rollin' ten deep
Creepy crawlin' the night
Y'all know the deal
On the motherfuckin' hill
We all strapped to kill
Chill, hittin' licks, in the wind that never ceases
Gettin' mad cause they askin' me for three dollar pieces
How the fuck I s'pposed to come up
Off a sheist move
Run up on a twenty and come get your ass an ice cube
It ain't nothin', why you bumpin' in your Cutlass
Just understand the roughness, never cut
For the cutless
Cause it's do or die, you ask, who am I
That mama heartbreaker ever since junior high
In the eye of the public, the brown be the suspect
So the streets taught me to be loveless
Causin' raucous in a dope fiend's bucket
My two favorite subjects was "duck FEDs" and "fuck it"

Chorus: South Park Mexican
The night shift
Young hustlers workin' grave yards
The night shift
Street soldiers workin' grave yards
My nine be, beside me
Tonight, we work the night shift
My nine be, beside me
Tonight, we work the night shift

[Verse 2: Pimpstress]
It's your midnight mistress
Player named Pimpstress
I keep it crunk
Handle up
On my business
Queen of your clique
Fiend for my shit
I'm sucked and corrupt
Sixteen in my clip
Puffin' black, and mobs, you can't cramp my style
Player-hatin' bitches make me crack a smile
Tonight
We whooride in the moonlight
My Freddy Ruger sounds like the fourth of July
Fools die
Fuckin' with my feria
Daddy steaks
Wanna marry ya, then bury ya
Nina Ross, Mary Jane, Ms. Cocaine
The three devils brought us deep in the dope game
So strange
True G's won't change
Close range
Left your boys with no brains
Street zombies, takin' out posses
Dangerous hobbies
Just call me

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
Alone in my home
Cock my gats
I'm known for my dope, so I watch for jacks
Kicked the burglar
Come on in
Bring all your men, let the games begin
Pumpin' em in a G manner, hot shots, comin' out my banana
Got plans like Santa Anna and balls like Tony Montana
Trick or treat, smell my heat
Hear my motherfuckin' drum beat
Don't believe the tales from my hood, come see
It ain't a joke, you can smoke, this Wonderland
I kicks this shit so you motherfuckers understand
I pop mine
With a glock nine
Blow that head off a motherfuckin' stop sign
Be the one, never
You come, I come better
Bring your umbrella
I bring the rough weather
One treasure, one pleasure
Choppin' up chedder
Ya whole crew get done by one fella

Repeat Chorus</pre>
