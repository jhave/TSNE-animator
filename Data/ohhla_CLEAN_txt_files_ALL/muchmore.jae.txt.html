Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Love Ballad]
Lovers come and then lovers go
That's what folks say, don't they know
They're not there, when you love me, hold me and say, okay
And what we have is much more than they could see

What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see

[Verse 1]
One of my uncles used to play throb in daylight around the house
Noisy lil me always asking what that's about
Then I had another uncle one that throw back
David Ruffin, Marvyn Gaye and Bobby Womack
But I was on the Joe and TV raps
Soul trained and Apollo had my eyes attached
And in junior high I got a black and white composition
Booked up a year in the thoughts and start my mission
Now I'm high school in the lunch room cypress
Freshman with a cold flow got the lunch room on fire
Fast forward to now, been on charge all around
They can't believe I produced this conclude this dear music

[Bridge: Love Ballad]
Lovin' you gave me something new
That I've never felt, never dreamed of
Something's changed though it's not the
Feeling I had before, oh, it's much much more

[Verse 2]
As the late great Nate Dogg would say
I smoke weed everyday
Virgo to the bone till the day the lord end me
But I swear I should've been born on 4 20
Shout out to the stoners, I mean all of them
I might just say fuck rap and move to Oregon
Might move to Seattle and open a dispensary
Might move to Colorado and nobody hear from me
People who don't know you don't get it
But I don't expect them to get it cause
You see we hold a special bond
We take me beyond
You should get pubbed for my songs
They probably think I'm gone but
When I'm stressed you take care of the pain
So dear Mary Jane

[Chorus: Love Ballad]
Lovers come and then lovers go
That's what folks say, don't they know
They're not there, when you love me, hold me and say, okay
And what we have is much more than they could see

What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see
What we have is much more than they could see</pre>
