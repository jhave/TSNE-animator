[Verse 1]
[Foxy Brown]
ayo yoyoyo one two one two (OH!)
Brooklyn is definetly in the building tonight y'all!
This is the remix, I'm in the best shape of my life y'all
Oh yes I mean..
Home girl I came to party (okay)
Young mans watchin my body (ohh!)
He's a haggle and no i'm not baggin him (uhh ooh!)
But you don't want the girls to come over and start askin him
What you wanna do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you tryin to do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you wanna do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you tryin to do (Yeah!)
I'll show you how to do this hun, what?
How y'all want it my pumps is 900
These ain't polo, nigga, these is manolo
Twist Rovers y'all runnin's over
I grooves on with a mean diddy bop
And an H-Todd jean and a good shoe on now
Catch me in the hood stylin proper
Them dudes say I spit like a dude in a bitch body

[Noreaga]
Home boy, I'm drunk in the club and won't hurl
Home boy, I'm leavin the club with white girl
Home boy, get out of my face and just taste
Home boy, I'm leavin this spot with new case
UH-OH, see these niggas gotta stay in they lanes
With a clown ass Foxy and they ain't the same
At the white boy club, while I'm buyin the bar
They like hey now you still an all star (Heh Heh)

[Chorus]
Playboy, we came to party (ohh!)
Your bitch was tryna fuck me (ohh!)
She's a haggler naw I'm not taggin her (uhh ohh!)
But you don't want them boys to come over and start askin ya (ohh!)
What you wanna do? (Nothin')
What you tryna to do? (Nothin')
What y'all wanna do? (Nothin')
What the fuck y'all tryna to do

[Verse 2]
[Capone]
Well I'm known to keep it thorough in the MC field
We ain't respectin no one and two to ya nail
Cuz I shoot to get loose, when its time to perform
Fuck riots in the set, when they turn my mic on
I'll rap a second time, and put two in the air
EAT MONEY the bridge murder unit is here
Nigga front and get popped, ain't no fuckin with my dough
Girls with my jock, with my dough intro

[Maze]
I'll like the way she movin in her pradas
She got a booty like and African (YEEAH)
I bet her last name ain't bam bottom (NOOO)
Now get ya diamonds (YEEAH), if you ain't knowin left brat
We sayin show up, you still sayin hi
[Muze]
Homeboy, we ain't come to party
We came to buy ya drinks
Til ya earl and ya mink
When you drunk brainless, make you relinquish
Everything you came with, this is the remix!

[Chorus]
[Bridge: repeat 8X]
La la la la la la la la la (ohh!)

[Verse 3]
P. Diddy (Noreaga)
You know its rough, rugged, hard cuz i'm P
(You can't touch Pone and you can't touch me)
(You faggots) No con rappers on quest
(Forget your headphones, boy your gonna need a vest)
You know I flips it in the trucks and the coupes
(See my wife ain't home, but my hookers is loose)
I keeps a haggler inside an accura
(And all my niggas, they gotta start baggin her)

[Muze]
Yo step, hold up, twist the dro up
Switch the flow up, might hit ya hoe up
Cuz ya girl was lookin at me
One x, she's really freaky
[Maze]
Hey y'all M-A-Z-E

Imma rub out my enemies, hatin
Crush the industry, get kid in bought them all like the..

[Chorus]
[Bridge: repeat 8X]
La la la la la la la la la (ohh!)
