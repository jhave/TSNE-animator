Listen
Old white men is runnin this rap shit
Corporate force's runnin this rap shit
Setae israli is runnin this rap shit
We poke out the ashes for a chance to cash in
Cocaine, is runnin this rap shit
Dro, 'gnac and E-pills is runnin this rap shit

The rape over, turn your face over nigga
No god in disguise it's me, game over
Hey lil souljahs you're ready for more?
But don't ask what you're fighting for
They thought that you sur--vived the gunfight, the drama, the stress
You get in the line of fire we get the big ass cheques
You gettin your choice to pimp
Make your choice and fall in
This is ho stroll B I, take that cock in your behind, Beatch
Hit the streets and perform for us
Hold hard and bring it on to us, fucker
I let you sip, comes an army, get a Mercedes
And kick back and let you pay me, my Mack is crazy
I leave the, knife and fist fight filled with glamour
Yeah, take a picture what this platinum plated sledgehammer
We over-do it add the fire and explosion to it
We're so confused so we run rap music

MTV, is runnin this rap shit
Viacom is runnin this rap shit
AOL and Time Warner runnin this rap shit
We poke out the ashes for a chance to cash in
Cocaine, is runnin this rap shit
Hennessey, is runnin this rap shit
Quasi homosexuals is runnin this rap shit

Watch out we run the world

That's it</pre>
