Typed by: AZ Lyrics

My name is Chris Palko
And I'm a former patient
Of Stony Lodge Hospital

[Verse 1]
You dropped me off and left me here and started your vacation
Away from me with your new family I got no invitation
If you don't think he's abusive it's because he's in your ear
If I don't see things your way then I'm not thinking clear?
I was just in your house going to school again for validation
Pissed you off now I'm in the hospital eating medication
And if I tell them I don't want to take something I'm still myself
But the drugs they're making me take are making me want to kill myself
And if I try to refuse meds and they force it in me
Everything they write on my chart is a block of bring me

[Chorus]
Down
Why you gotta tie me down?
Kick we while I'm on the the ground?
There's nothing you can take from me now
Cause all I've had has been thrown out
So why you gotta tie me down
I was only trying to figure it out
Would like to get up but I'm tied down

[Verse 2]
When you wake up drugged it's tough to get your thoughts sorted
Then you realize you're tied down about to be drawn and quartered
But there's no horses about to rip you limb from limb
But the tranquilizer in your blood is what they give to them
And after thirteen hours of being tied to a bed
Due to shuffle the hallways, fuck off, and die in your head
Thought when I made it out I'd be carried and celebrated
Thought of who I was when I went in, got out, he didn't make it out
Who would think every stupid thought that you contemplated
Would convolute what was constituted as complicated?
Permanently faded necessary that they calm me right
You drag yourself around for days relate to zombie life
I saw a light, desperately trying to move near it
But I'm plagued with thoughts as soon as I leave I hope they tear it

[Chorus]
Down
Why you gotta tie me down?
Kick we while I'm on the the ground?
There's nothing you can take from me now
Cause all I've had has been thrown out
So why you gotta tie me down
I was only trying to figure it out
Would like to get up but I'm down

When I get there...
Let me in...</pre>
