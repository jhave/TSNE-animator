{Hip hop tune plays on car radio}

[Eminem] I'm gonna kill this bitch
	 I'm gonna kill her
	 I'm going to fuckin' jail
	 'Cause I'm gonna kill, this bitch
[Gary] 	 Yo' man, I don't know
[Eminem] What?
[Gary]   I got a real, really bad feelin' about this
[Eminem] Man, would you shut the fuck up Gary? 
	 You've always got a bad feeling man
	 That's her car right there. Just park
[Gary]   Alright, just let me park. I'm parking!
[Eminem] Fuckin', turn the car off dog

{Car stops, Hip hop tune stops, handbrake is applied}

[Gary]   Alright
[Eminem] Alright, we wait
[Gary]   We wait for what?
[Eminem] We wait until she comes out.
         Then I'm gonna fuckin' kill her
[Gary]   Man, you ain't gonna kill nobody
[Eminem] Man, just shut the fuck up dog
[Gary]   What the fuck did you bring that for?
[Eminem] Just shut up, fuckin' clip is empty
[Gary]   Man, don't point that shit at me!
[Eminem] It's not even loaded bitch, look!
[Gary]   Dude! 
[Eminem] [laughs]
[Gary]   God I fuckin' hate when you do that shit
[Eminem] Yeah but it's funny as fuck
[Gary]   You're gonna fuck around and kill me one of these days, I swear
[Eminem] It get's you every time

{Pause, then dramatic music kicks in}

[Eminem] Is that her?
[Gary]   Where?
[Eminem] Right there motherfucker
[Gary]   [sighs]
	 Yeah, fuck
[Eminem] Alright, get up, get up
[Gary]   Here we go again
[Eminem] Get down!
[Gary]   What the fuck?  
	 Do you want me to do get under the car?
[Eminem] Yo', who's she walkin' with?
[Gary]   How the fuck am I supposed to know? 
	 You told me to duck down
[Eminem] It's the fucking bouncer
         Did she just kiss him?
[Gary]   I don't think so.
[Eminem] Dog, she just fuckin' kissed him
[Gary]   No, she didn't!
[Eminem] She's kissing him dog!
[Gary]   No she's not...oh shit
[Eminem] C'mon, motherfucker!
[Gary]   MAARRSSHH!!!
