Yo, I'm gettin' ready to put y'all up on somethin', man (What's goin' on, yo)
Yo
When you see somethin' ill (Uh hun)
You know what I mean
That's whoa (That's what whoa means)
Anything ill you seein'

Have you a big six at the curb, that's whoa (Okay)
Especially if he got the fully equipped kit on it
It's whoa
Like you know what I mean

(Verse 1)
I had this bad chick Uptown, she was (Whoa)
Had me messed up in the head, I mean (WHOA)

Refrain: Black Rob
I'll rip your torso
I live the fast life
Come through in the Porshe slow like whoa
My people, like dough
Light dro, nitro, mic flow, nice clothes, like whoa

(Verse 2)
Ease pain with [{*cocaine*}] like whoa {*sniffing*}
Now I'm Doc Strange in the Range like (Whoa)
Hundred miles an hour, switchin' lanes like (Whoa)
Plus I'm gettin' brain from this chick like (Whoa)
Finger near a brother A-[{*hole*}] like (Whoa)
Scene floss riches and chicks like (Whoa)
Nine-nine Jag, Benz, Coupe like (Whoa)
You keep them cheese lines on your block like (Whoa)
Grenade through your window, money

So I'm a go, toe to toe, blow for blow, like whoa

Repeat Refrain

(Verse 3)
We bag it, then flip it, life, whoa
Cars, we jack it, then strip it, life, whoa
Fully equip it, front to back, like whoa
Spittin' on fiends that come for crack like whoa
Asked 'em for shorts
Now baby, that's whoa
Half on his quart
Now baby, that's whoa
Flow so properly, you'll see I'm whoa
Ain't no stoppin' me, I'm deep like whoa
Joints be poppin', B, and we creep like whoa
Hear my name in these streets like whoa
Must I pound the concrete like whoa
Fill his rich ass
Head to feet like (Whoa)
Your man ain't (Whoa)
The judge ain't (Whoa)
