Song:   Rite Mind
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I just haven't been in my right mind lately
I got too much money

[Chorus]
Ain't been in my rite mind
'Cause all my niggas doing time
Ain't been in my rite mind
These niggas trying to steal my shine

The newt, he just took a fire
I can't lie, that shit hurt me inside
My young nigga, that's my right to die
But he got caught up on isle 65
I know you worried about me
But I'm all good, nigga
I got Blacky with me and these little niggas
These shooters in the cliffs throw away
Them real pussy
I got extended bricks on my bricks
Got remix in them
All I know is Geo Grime
The trouble make you loose your mind
Don't I mind, you were never fine
Meet the plug at the state line

[Chorus]

Ain't been in my rite mind
Since Lil' Brook got time
One of the real niggas I know
Taught me how to grind
And you a damn liar if you say
He gay or something
Gave me my first couple of thousand
Told me run it up
And I ain't look back
Bought a pack, made some rags
Now, why the good nigga gone?
Somebody tell me that!
But I'm a still here
And I'm a go get me paid
Got a polar bear down
So I can start thinking
Shit killing me, they ain't feeling me
I don't mind playing
But still gotta watch out for the snakes
[?]
Push your shit, too bad
[?]
Ain't no flaw in that

[Chorus]

The fans want me for my past
I escape the streets with a bang
They know I still clocking out
50 thousand worth a shopping bag
We niggas still in swag
I ain't really worried about that
I'm a real young O.G. boss, nigga
A lot of niggas man 'cause that
Red, white and blue flag
Get money, that's Blackomedo gang, nigga
In my hood we spring freaks up
Squeaky 2, that's my little nephew
For my cousin Quae 40
Shoot your ass with that Glock 40

[Chorus]</pre>
