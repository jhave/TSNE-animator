[Drag-On]
Uh, come on
Uh, uh, uh, come on
Come on, come on
When Drag finger foreman
I don't ever wanna get off
Skip three, count to ten
Ref. Griffin step to him
Y'all know how the riders ride
We always disqualified
I'mma a total savage
Like Lex Luger, you'll get the total package
Straight power bomb like Kevin Nash and Sid Vicious
Small like Ray Mysterious put y'all in big ditches
Boy missing, it's that boy Drag from the kitchen
Slap your man hand, get an equal ass whipping
Roll like Wolf Pack, toss men like Four Horsemen
And y'all can meet Drag in the middle of the ring
Y'all can bang like I'm in the ping
Before y'all hear the ding
I bring the things that'll make ya sweat
Make the blood sting
You can be a big wrestler still I pimpin' ya
The call me The Crippler' leglock will cripple ya
Cause I don't care who's the tallest
My body slam's flawless
Then run for governor like Jesse The Body Ventura

[Jadakiss]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Jadakiss baby throw plenty of blows
Cause the Ryders roll thick like N.W.O.
Everybody wanna shine until they get Steiner lined
Show vital signs, pinned till three
Yo ain't leave with the belt, then you ain't win to me
Cause I'm the heavy weight champ I'll give you a title shot
You better bring your  cause I always win the match
Run up in your dressing room chair to your head
Then I choke slam your manager and leave with the bread
Don't matter what the price is I'm copping the 
I hop off the top rope and chop you in the throat
Come through like Sting all black with a bat
Then I drop you like Goldberg right on your back
You know styling and profiling like Ric Flair dressed me
Sort of like Kipman, all the chicks think I'm sexy
Ruff Ryders, WCW, you wanna test me

[All]
No matter how it go down
I'm putting you under
Whether it's Monday Night Nitro
Or Thursday Night Thunder
A Pay Per View event where everybody get bent
I'm trying to knock your ass out
And make sure your pinned
No matter how it go down
I'm putting you under
Whether it's Monday Night Nitro
Or Thursday Night Thunder
A Pay Per View event where everybody get bent
I'm trying to knock your ass out
And make sure your pinned

[Eve]
This chick known for body slamming
Spines I split in half
Think this one here's a joke
I'm gon lay back and let your laugh
Till I put you in the sleeper
Dead to the world
A three count ain't gon save you
From the power of this girl
Leg drop from the top to your throat
Now how you feel?
Figure four to end it all
And people thinking this ain't real
The belt is mine and I'm gon keep it that way
Cause I'm the champ
Blondy kill em, Blondy kill em, yo
You hear the voices chant
My dogs walk me out to the ring
And pile around
Give me a minute till it's over
Tag teams you're going down
I'm feared like Miss Elizabeth
She's wrecking all
Cowards better stay away
Cause I ain't scared of none of y'all
Calling anybody out that think they ready for this fight
Clothes line just to set it off
You better say goodnight and say your prayers
Cause believe you ain't gon walk away smiling
Ruff Ryders, WCW, we stay wiling

[Styles]
I'm like Diamond Dallas Page
Guaranteed to leave you screaming
Cause you talk too much
Like you Bobby The Brain Heenan
You probably match out
Like I'm buff like Bagwell
Red shoe like The Cat give me your heart
I do damage like I'm managed by Jimmy The Hart
Somebody tell Mean Gean go and talk to Benero
I'mma always be around like fast Eddie Gabero
Rap off wrestling, call me the colonel
I'mma make you dance around like you Disco Inferno
I'mma do the Ruff Ryder till I rock your world
Then I'm leaving out the building with the Nitro girls
Bald headed with tattoos just like I'm Saturn
So watch when you talk I'm stronger than Scott Noan
I'mma always make my ending perfect like Curt Henning
I'mma always start trouble too, WCW
SP, heavy weight champ, who the  are you?
