	One time for your mind, here we go
	You know my style, now peep the flow
	Girl I know you're with it, so drop your seven digits
	Got a minute, then let me know			     (Repeat 2x)

Shorty's got it going on (Is that so, who you be?)
I'm a slick type of nigga that like to lounge on the low
(I be seeing you around) That's all dead
I just swing and do my thing and lay low like the Feds
Straight up real, no scam
(So where your girl at?) Probably out with your man
(Yeah yeah, that rapping is nice)
My mack is precise, I'm on you like a tracking device
Forget a crew, I got solo tactics
I'm not a half-ass nigga, baby I got the total package
I never fronted, you can get it if you want it
Won't say I'm the best, but I'm not that far from it
You know my style (You like to play low)
(You probably be going "Yeah yeah") Okay, if you say so
Give me a minute and it's over
I'm one bad soldier, I was flexing before Mad Cobra
I got so much charm, even if you with your moms
Huh, I play it cool like the Fonz
Whether weekends, Monday through Friday
I know this ain't Burger King, but I'll still have it my way

	One time for your mind, here we go
	You know my style, now peep the flow
	Girl I know you're with it, so drop your seven digits
	Got a minute, then let me know			      (Repeat 2x)

Oooh, shorty's got it going on (Who you be?)
A ruffneck, living for '95 and beyond
(I see you playing around the field)
I used to stick and move, now I just lounge and chill
I'm not the type to be sweating crazy
(I need a real man) Shit, I'm as real as you get, baby
My game is outstanding
(I got a boyfriend) Well now you got a man friend
(Oh it's like that?) Is you kidding? Shit...
I got so much game, I could make a nun change religions
I got flavors like a rainbow, you dig what I'm saying?
(Yeah, but that shit is all game, though)
Come on, I know you like it
Don't font on me, I read your whole card like a psychic
(Yeah, you got clout) No doubt, plus I'm getting money
Ain't a brother out teaching when I'm kicking, honey
I'm like Silk and H-Town, can you dig it?
I'll lick you up and down and knock your boots in a minute
Messing with me, nothing but good can happen
There's a new sheriff in town
(Really, where?) You're looking at him

	One time for your mind, here we go
	You know my style, now peep the flow
	Girl I know you're with it, so drop your seven digits
	Got a minute, then let me know			      (Repeat 2x)

I'm not the type to act a fool, catching brothers with a tool
I just bag up skins, I play it cool
I kick game, I have your mind is
Cause I can be bummy and nappy headed, and still pull a Dom P
(Pimping is hard) Not to me
You got a lot to see, the way I put skins under lock and key
And let them front the role like they outstanding
Huh, I leavem 'em out standing in the cold
A girl act up, then I cut her off
(Is your game smooth?) Is it? My shit's butter soft
So won't y'all just hear me in
(Why's that?) I get girls open like a cesarian
Yo, I roll with the big men and I don't have to trickin'
And mess around just to get skins
So all y'all niggas that's geese, I can make that shit cease
When I slide up in the peace

	One time for your mind, here we go
	You know my style, now peep the flow
	Girl I know you're with it, so drop your seven digits
	Got a minute, then let me know			      (Repeat 4x)</pre>
