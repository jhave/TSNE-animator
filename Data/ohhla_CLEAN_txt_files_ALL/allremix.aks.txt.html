[Chorus]: Double (Ak'sent)
All I need in this world is somebody
For me that treats me right (All I need in this world)
So I know who gone be there when I need him
And hold me down for life (Hold me down, baby)
Baby boy, if you want me, know how
I feel for you inside (Cause this is crazy)
Do you know that I love you so, honey
I'm gone make you cry

[Ak'sent]
(Verse 1)
I don't care if you don't
Party like Diddy
Face ain't Omarion's
Body ain't 50
As long as I can call him mine
I'd be still with him
He say he love me all the time
Make me feel pretty
Get his name on my titty
No baby mama, no drama, ain't
And I'm no
Empty promises, promisin' to get me
Everything I need, if I need it, the gift be
Everything I want, if I want it, he a get me
When I'm gone, he a miss me
Sent for me to kiss me
Simply my simile, my melody my symphony
Everything he telling me, I feel it cause he meant for me
His thug is repelling me
Love will forever be
All in together now, wifey on the recipe
Married on the spot, be the cherry on top
If I fallin' forever now, his arms be for catchin' me
And he ain't never letting me drop
No

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Double (Ak'sent)
Cause you're making me
Crazy inside and I can't hide or lie (Crazy in love)
And it's plain to see
I belong with you and you belong with me (I'm, all, yours)
Boy
Baby, you and me
Can spend some time together (Just a little time)
If you promise me
I will promise you that it's our life (I'm a ride-or-die chick

(Verse 2)
The rings and things he sing about, he bring 'em out
He bring the bling-bling, said the dream of a spouse
From the first scene, it's like I seen no doubts
That's why I play queen to the king of the house
I like to be wifey, I fiend for the clout
His life excite me
Ain't none like him
His love entice me
To scream, no doubt
When he touch me
Tease me
Squeeze me
Bite me
Please me, I know it ain't easy, but he do it
Won't leave me
He ain't never deceive me, to prove it
To his
Boys, I'm his number one boo and
Ain't nobody true like the truest
He keeps skies blue and
Keep eyes dries, shoot
Why cry, when I have this fly guy
Got me on Cloud Nine when his love inside
I had to give this thug a try
Uh hun

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
He's
Humble at best
Shouldn't take up as soft
Tried to punk, I test 'em
Hold somethin'
Wanna teach dummies a lesson
True to the streets
He don't give cop confessions
He never wear a wire
Top boss stove like Avon from the wire
Blue Range Rover 22 inch riders
Stash box under the dash box, craters are hot
Gotta be with him, I don't know what I'd do if I'm not

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Double]
Cause you're making me (You're making me...)
Crazy
And it's plain to see (And it's plain to see...)
Oh, uh
Baby, you and me
Can spend sometime together
If you promise me
I will promise you that it's our life</pre>
