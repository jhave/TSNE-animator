Girl you're too sexy
come and sit with me in V.I.P.
With those curves and cocoa skin
now where have you been
The tattoo on your belly's kinda hot
them about a shorty in the spot
You came in with a man
but I'm making plaaans

(chorus 1)
to be next to you
been checking out the rest and they just wont do
pretty young thing in a lexus coupe
been praying everyday to blessed with you (blessed with you)
but I am next to you
all I think about is undressing you
playing all alone just to touch with you
can we get it on in my bedroom
would ya mind

(chorus 2)
would ya mind
if I got to know ya better baby
your my type
and I really really want you lady so
make up your mind
do you want him or do you want me
take your time
its alright, I dont mind

I see ya checking out my rings and the platinum watch
your trying to figure out what I'm not
the keys to my range around my neck
and a legit royalty check
if ya looking for someone who has nice things
someone to give ya all the love you need
look no further I'm that man
and I got a plaaan

(chorus 1)
(chorus 2)

I wanna take ya home
get ya all alone
turn the lights down low
to a private show
kiss ya from head to toe
take off all your clothes
throw em on the floor
make a video
baby come stay awhile
you cant deny
what ya feel inside
its in your eyes
make up your mind
stop wasting time
baby its alright
would ya mind

(chorus 2) 2x

I wanna take ya home
get ya all alone
turn the lights down low
to a private show
kiss ya from head to toe
take off all your clothes
throw em on the floor
make a video
baby come stay awhile
you cant deny
what ya feel inside
its in your eyes
make up your mind
stop wasting time</pre>
