"Hey listen, I have a record I want you to play.
 Don't you think the kids would enjoy a nice song with a melody?"
   "What you got, homez?"
"It is a rare, one of a kind, original pressing." (*echoes*)

This is a world premiere
Yo, yo, yo (Pacewon)
Yo, yo, yo (Pacewon)
(Roc-A-Bloc) yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, Pacer
Full clip, one up in the chamber, danger
Ask you what you want, what's the flavor?
I got thirty-five when I sign with a major
Invested twenty-nine point eight, spent the change up
Never been the type to take advice from a stranger
Gun next to me like my neighbor
Stay tough, spit the hot shit to get the paper
I roll with more force than Darth Vader
Let's see what you made of
To hip hop heads, I'm like a saviour
nigga that ball like Big Pun, but don't wanna be a player
This year I declare war on the mayor
Like let my niggas out the devil's lair, or I'll spray ya
Park your here, spark your fears
Man without dog gone care, walk on air
Check before I mark your gear, call y'all queers
Could rock steady for four more years, all y'all scared
Terrorist niggas want to bomb, I'm here
Quick to cop, pop me in their cd-rom and stare
Even if our cliques don't get along, who care
You still be glaring at the clothes me and my crew wear
You need to lighten up, digest a few beers
Before you end up meeting the man you do fear
This year I declare war on the mayor
Like my niggas out the devil's lair, or I'll spray ya
niggas thought they couldn't be beat, no love
Think it's all coming we speak, no sir
The fact that I'm usually deep in most clubs
You know it's going down when I'm creepin' close up
You non-descript niggas might sneak and throw duds
But when the bomb go off, those who sleeping woke up
Pacewon, cock my heat back, and blow slugs
Making you gangsters with tree and grow bud
My Outsider posse meet and show fucks
When hip hop was like where we had to grow up
This year I declare war on the mayor
Like let my niggas out the devil's lair, or I'll spray ya
