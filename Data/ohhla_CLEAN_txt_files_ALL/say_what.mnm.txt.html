[Dre] So I'm out the game huh?
[Em]  Huh? {*echoes*} Yo Dre, WE RIDIN?
[Dre] Whatever!
[Em]  Haha! Well I'm witcha homies
[Dre] Okay; let's handle the small shit

[Eminem]
I was born to brew up storms and stir up shit
Kick up dust, CUSS 'til I slur up spit
Grew up - too quick went through too much do too much shit
Corrupt, and I'm a pour it on like syrup bitch!
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk the shit for what it's worth
'til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth
{*poof*} And if I fumble the verse, keep goin
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches pulled no punches that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll EAT shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit

[Dr. Dre]
Creep wit me, as we take a lil' trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age
(But what about Jermaine?) Fuck Jermaine!
He don't belong speakin mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think, I don't read
your lil' interviews, and see what you're sayin
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, Mini-Me with a bunch of little Mini-Yous
runnin around your backyard swimmin pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven-year-olds

[Chorus 2X: Eminem]
Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
how you say it whenever you sayin it, just remember
how you said it when you were sprayin it
So who you playin with huh.. huh.. huh.. huh?

[Eminem]
Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
from a Dixie Cup, if you ever mix me up
or CONFUSE ME with a Canibus or Dre with a DUPRI!
We'll rub it in, every club you're in will have you
blackballed and make sure you never rap a-fuckin-gain
Dre ain't havin it; long as I'm here to play Devil's Advocate

[Dr. Dre]
If there was some magic shit
I could wave over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
and buried to make sure the tradition carries on, I would

[Eminem]
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't; not even if I could

[Dr. Dre]
From the hood and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered

[Eminem]
And I'ma only sucka punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off
Cause I know if they get up I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a FUCK!  White 'Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill'
and grow up, to be Atilla, go nuts and be a pillar

[Dr. Dre]
And I'm, somethin of a phenom'
One puff of the chron', I'm unstoppable
I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
so come along with us (come on!)

[Chorus]

[Dr. Dre]
Now anybody who knows Dre
knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin all day
But I handle my business cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin it your way {*clack*}
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
Cause this is my space, you invade it, live to regret it
and you die tryin to violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated; eyes dilated

[Eminem]
Heh, like my old lady
Cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean
is two different things, dependin on your mood if it swings
Think too many things
Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything
Catch a contact then I'm gone and I'm back
I speed right; and my looseleaf's my launchpad

[Dr. Dre]
And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything, catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre?
You better get a vest, and invest
in somethin to protect your head and neck

[Eminem]
And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm best
in the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death
Five mics in The Source?  Ain't holdin my fuckin breath
But I'll suffocate for the respect
'fore I'll breathe to collect a fuckin check

[Chorus]

[Dre] Watch your fuckin mouth

[Tim] Yo this Timbaland, tell them I said suck *chka* MY dick!</pre>
