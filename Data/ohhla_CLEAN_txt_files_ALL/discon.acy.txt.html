[Aceyalone]
Hey! What's up world?
This is Aceyalone and this is dedicated to you
You worthless piece of shit (man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted)

Shoot for the moon, end up amongst the stars
Work hard, play hard, hard times, play your cards
Far as you wanna go, still stayin on my goal
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
Yeah make room, make a way, make my day
Make money, meet your maker, make a play
Run a lifetime for it huh, what'chu gotta say?
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
Yeah Ace to the deuce though, mucho gusto
You so spacey, Acey dey uno
You flow like sumo, Robinson Caruso
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
I'm like top on a bottom shot, caught 'em in a pot
Look how I got 'em hot, it's ridiculous
Service on the wickedness, Arhythmiticulas
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
Yeah do what you gotta do, say what you wanna say
Act like you wanna act, do that shit anyway
Think how you wanna think, play how you wanna play
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
Now that's what I call rockin, work it out baby
Ain't this a crazy world, hit it on the buttons
Tell your homey stop frontin, he ain't got nuttin
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
Born alone, die alone, rollin stone
Put my own on the chrome, let it be known
Rock the world off the dome bring it home Aceyalone
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
The great ones did it to me, heaven or hell
Rhyme oceans 'round them fools, 11 and 12
Bullet rolls, somethin tribal, yellin from the trail
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
It's like ich-ni-son-chi, freak the drumbeat
One sun, one heat, one-way street
One love, one Jeep, one star, one eat
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
Yeah love what you want to, claim what you wanna claim
Be who you wanna be, take a walk in the rain
And do it if it feels good, put an end to the pain
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
I do what they all cain't, I'm like Shawshank
Pray with the fallen saints, while they draw a blade
Draw a wall full of paint, smoke cheeba cheeba mayne
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
I been to the mountaintop, I didn't see a thang
Same view from the bottom, I didn't see a change
Life got the same problems, only got me to blame
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
All of 'em want power, but only few get it
Few spit it like I spit it, and only few get it
Why you wanna two-bit it, don't know what to do wit it
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
They try to contain me, hold my body back
I know where the party at, right where I left it
This place is so hectic and I'm so skeptic
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
Yeah do what you gotta do, say what you wanna say
Act like you wanna act, do that shit anyway
Think how you wanna think, play how you wanna play
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted
Yeah love what you want to, claim what you wanna claim
Be who you wanna be, take a walk in the rain
Do it if it feels good, put an end to the pain
Man I'm just so dis-con-nec-ted</pre>
