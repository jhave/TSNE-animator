[KRS-One]
Be-dee-dee-da-dee, dee-dee-dee-dee-da-de-day
KRS-One come in with the Tech &amp; Sway

Yo, I rock upon the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets, I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on the Sway and the Tech, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
Nevertheless I'll WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back, but for now just SECKLE!!
HA, HA, HA, HA</pre>
