[GZA]
All I need is a beat, with a continuous loop
And a live vibe, that'll hypnotize like the flute
Along with something that's rugged by nature like the forest
Composed like the symphony without a chorus
A place with the path and trail that you follow
With the wood, where you drive your nails, but too hollow
Far from reality, with a slim chance of getting back
Even if you narrowly escape the hidden traps
Nothing but the driven raps written in my notebook
Inspired by the cap and the gown, that's on the coat hook
Prepare for the chemical rush, something new to cause
Your heart to bass, but it's tangable to touch
Associate with those who are consumed with beats
Produce fire, until they melt the room with heat
You know my ink lay all over the sheets, let us gather around
And form words, everytime they meet

[Chorus: GZA]
Allah Be a Born, Cee Divine, Equality
Father, then after that, there's the G-O-D
He or Her, I Islam, then Justice
King of Kingdom, Love, Hell or Right, we still exist
Master, Now in Cypher/O, Power's the Queen
Rule of Rulers, Self of Save, the Truth of the square, the same
Universe, Victory, Wisdom, Unknown/X, Why/Y
Zig Zag Zig, and now we're back home

[GZA]
I brought butter for the popcorn, dip for the chips
And ego for your trip, some scripts for you to flip
Corrections for mishaps, errors, or mistakes
Fly raps for beats, and pop and lock for breaks
A legend in my own lifetime, from one rhyme
That was specially designed, from the hook to bottom line
Shine's like a precious jewel, cut up in the workshop
With specialized handcrafted tools
Couldn't buy this hardware, so don't swipe your card there
Better yet, fold your hand, cuz you holding the wrong pair
One hit wonders, get a little shine like flashlights
But when I drop the bomb and explode like gas pipes
A livewire, known as the dragon that spit fire
Verbal action, hot as the grease from deep fryers
Delivered in the perfect pitch, because hip hop
It's all in my genes/jeans, the pattern the seam, in every stitch
