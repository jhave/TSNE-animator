Still the King of Rock, hoe around the tick-tock
Rappers sweatin Joseph Simmons, ever since I dropped _Rock Box_
Multiplatinum, waxin em while I'm maxin em
"Who's House?"  God's House, so chill while I'm taxin em

[D.M.C.]
Rappers poppin mad smack, about the King of Rap
Ten million sold, SEVEN DIGIT CONTRACT

[Run]
JMJ, gettin busy on the crossfader
Beats hardcore, diesel like the Schwarzeneggar

[Parrish] Respect the black crown
[Sermon]  Sounds underground
[D.M.C.]  Any stage they built
[Joseph]  Run tore it down!
