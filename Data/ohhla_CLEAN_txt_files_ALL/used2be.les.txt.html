This is dedicated to everybody who had a first love
R Les

[Ryan Leslie] [Backround]
Ya don't stop
Ya won't stop
Ya don't stop
And it won't stop

[Fabolous] [Talking]
F to the A B

[Ryan Leslie] [Talking]
It's got to be next selection
Just rock with it come on

[Ryan Leslie] [Backround]
Ya don't stop
Ya won't stop
Ya don't stop
And it won't stop

[Fabolous]
Baby it could be
How it used to be
Or maybe
It could be you ain't used to me
Cause it used to be the charm
But I'm early as a rooster on a farm
With a jacob exclusive on the arm
But nothing come close to the feeling of your first
If you love to hustle it's like dealing on the first
It's deeper than the dishes on the V's
Just remember that the fishes in the sea
Wishes they could be with me

[Ryan Leslie]
I've been through it
You've been through it
Never want to break up, but you do it
Nothing's working
Both are hurtin'
You're going out and you catch yourself flirting
Arguing like
Every week it's
To the point where you really ain't speaking
So you leave her
But it's only
A matter of time before you say

Girl, I'm so broke down without you
Girl I messed up
Baby, Can you forgive me?
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Cause I was at my best when you was with me
It's funny
(Funny)
How things get re-arranged
(Re-arranged)
Now, Left out in the rain
Baby, baby

I know you feel what I'm talking bout

Cause we all got somebody who
Used to
She used to be your number one
She used to be your only lover
But now
She's gone and you miss her

Cause, she used to be

She used to be your number one
She used to be your only lover
But now
That's just what she used to be

Now every now and then
You get the feeling
Seein' her again might be appealing
So you call her, dial the number
Say you want to hook up
Cause you wonder
How she's doin?
Is she okay?
And do she wanna see you this friday?
And if it works out your way
This is what you hear yourself say

I'm so broke down without you
(Down and out)
Girl I messed up, can you ever forgive me?
I can't stop thinking bout you
(Can't stop, thinking bout)
Cause I was at my best when you was with me
It's funny
How things get re-arranged
(I'm left in the rain)
Left out in the rain
Baby, Baby
(You know just what I'm talking 'bout)
We've all had somebody who
Used to

She used to be your number one
(Used to be)
She used to be your only lover
(Now)
But now
(She's gone)
She's gone and you miss her
(And she used to be)
Cause she used to be your number one
(Used to be)
She used to be your only lover
(She used to be your baby)
But now that's just what she used to be
(And she Used to be)

[Fabolous]
I remember walking through park
On the phone talking till it's dark
Laying on the golden sands
Holding hands
Till we got golden tans
Knowing one day we gon' wear golden bands
Let's take it back when you had my name on your nails
And you came with the bails
Soon as I came in the jail
You was there for me
But I don't see you as much now
I guess I dropped the ball on a game-winning touchdown

[Ryan Leslie]
(And she used to)
She used to be your number one
(Used to be your...number one)
She used to be your only lover
(But now)
But now
(She's gone)
She's gone and you miss her

Cause she used to
She used to be your number one
She used to be your only lover
But now
That's just what she used to be

She's lost in your memory
She's lost in your memory
