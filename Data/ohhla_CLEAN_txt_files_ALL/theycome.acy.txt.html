Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[uncredited spoken word poet forms the song's intro]
As Arsenio Hall would say, things that make you go HMMMM
The enemy forces inside, approached a young warrior king
and tried to subdue him, but he fought back VAL-iant-ly
The warrior king had emerged from his fighter
and had spoken to one of his subjects
When he returned, the invaders tried to CUT HIM DOWN

[Aceyalone]
Nah!  None of that man!  No!  Uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, none of that no
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uhh

[Chorus One]
Bigger they come, the harder they fallin
It ain't, nothin but the soundboys brawlin
If you listen close in you can hear the reaper callin
(HEY HEY) Bigger they come, the harder they.. fall

[Aceyalone]
Mr. Big Bad Mouth Man don't know when to stay quiet
Always talkin bout how he can't be beat, but I don't buy it
Come try it!  No one man is a riot, seek the head and fly it
Man against a giant, David against Goliath, I shall triumph
Hold down the fort, hold ground with a fo'-pound
Pronoun in case it go down, cause people are just so low down
At the showdown, the faster he go the harder it is to slow down
Is it my town or yo' town?  Can't nobody hold me down
The, BIGGER THEY COME, but soon they won't make a sound
Snatch 'em up and take 'em down, shake the foundation mound
And that's that - now how would you react?
KABOOM out yo' back, it's no mo' movin back
It ain't no get back when the hammer kick back
When the warriors go out to war they seldom make it back
Back backed up against a wall, let's see who got the balls
Bigger they come, the harder they gotta fall

[Chorus Two]
Bigger they come, the harder they fallin
Bigger they come, the harder they fallin
Bigger they come, the harder they fallin
Bigger they come, the harder they, fall

[Chorus One]

[Aceyalone]
All I wanna know is why your man got so much ego
Tough guy, wanna pick a fight with me and my a-migos
But he knows, not what him take on is lethal
I'm everyday people, you want me superhero
Big as a redwood, or small as a bonsai
I'm a fungi/fun-guy, but anyway come test me, gon' die
No I'm not gun shy, more like a ninja
Get it when you least expect it
Hit him in the vital pressure points that injure
But I'm really not violent, I meditate in silence
But I was taught, give 'em physical justice if they whylin
Defend yo'self at all times, protect yo'self at all times
Respect yo'self at all times
It's self-preservation versus brutal mankind
Got, nothin to prove, I know mountains don't move
And Bigfoot don't tippy toe
That don't mean it won't get you though
Your ritual, walk around invincible, you imbecile!
Power is habitual, this you know is principal
To overtake the meek is irresistable and sensible
If conscience is invisible, and courage is so minimal
And then I go at 'em all, with unviersal laws
Bigger they come, the harder they gotta fall

[Chorus Two]

[Chorus One]

[Aceyalone]
Now any bad boy can be destroyed and anybody can get hit
Even if you hard, harder than, hard can get
You think you'll never be defeated not even a little bit
Because you hard, harder than, hard can get
I mean you too big, too bad, "2 Legit 2 Quit"
Because you hard, harder than, hard can get
You, try on a bad face, OH WHAT A PERFECT FIT
Because you hard, harder than, hard can get

Yo, yo yo - check it out
Yo back in the elementary school had a fight with the king of the class
I wasn't in the mood for getting beat up so I had to kick his ass!
I'm sick of bein bashed, lick a shot and lick it fast
Sooner or later the Gods and the Devils have to clash
Braveheart, gave his heart so he could save his country
Me I want to save the art to start before they hunt me
Whatcha momma taught you HUH?  Whatcha momma teach you (HUH?)
Don't know why I fought you, don't know why I beat you
STAND UP to the systematic automatic controller
Robotic, hypnotic, great psychotic ruler
Never give an easy win and NEVER take a draw for..
Bigger they come, the harder they gotta fall

[Chorus Two]

[Chorus One]

[Aceyalone]
Bigger they come, the harder they fallin
It ain't, nothin but the soundboys brawlin
Harder they come, the harder they fallin
It ain't, nothin but the soundboys brawlin
Rougher they come, the harder they fallin
It ain't, nothin but the soundboys brawlin
Aight..</pre>
