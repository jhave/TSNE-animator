[Verse 1]
You've always been right there to let me know everything's alright
Whenever darkness came my way You were my light
I wanna thank You for the difference in my life
Can't even count the reasons why ( ohhh I)

[Refrain]
I lift you up and praise Your name
You gave me strength to see another day
When I was lost, You helped me find my way
When it seems I can t face another day( That's when I call on.....)

[Chorus]
You-- In time trouble, faced with struggle I call no one but ..
You-- When I'm feelin lonely, no one around me still I call on ..
You-- You always placed Your arms around me when I needed..
You-- Thats why I sing this song to tell You
Lord I do love You

[Verse 2]
You are the only one who keeps on blessing me
At times, I thought that I was blind You helped me see
(Oh ho) And I can never pay You back for all You've done
Thats why I serve You faithfully and never give You up

I lift you up and praise Your name
You gave me strength to see another day
When I was lost you helped find my way
When it seems I can't face another day
That's when I call on..

[Chorus]

[Refrain]
Knock and He will answer
The lord will make a way
He's worthy of his praise

I know life is worth living
Becasue of you Jesus
I always call on You

[Chorus] - 3X
during second time altos say(Lord I love you: love you)

[Ending] - 4X
Boys say: All I wanna do
Girls echo: All I wanna do I
Boys echo: is to keep lovin you
Girls echo: is to keep lovin you</pre>
