[Eminem]
Hey yo Fif'

[50 Cent]

Call 'em and tell 'em
It's time to hate us again
We're back

[50 Cent]
Haha

[Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
My enemies crack corn but I don't care
You can be black white or albino yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See if you don't brag then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keept making them tired old threats
Little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but don't dare to try no shit
Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast
From out of nowhere you might find your career
Come to with *eek* and I'm just like OH YEAH

[Chorus]
See us on the award shows and we're like OH YEAH
Can we get more of those they like OH YEAH
See us keep blowing up we're like OH YEAH
So Jimmy can crack corn but i don't care

See me in the videos i'm like OH YEAH
See me ride up close your like OH EAH
And where's D12 at they like WE OVER HERE
And where the fuck we goin we're like NOWHERE

[Eminem]
You jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit let them talk shit cuz they talk shit
Knowing deep down they really just wanna squash it
Cuz no one wants to walk around steppining dog shit
And get doo doo on their shoe again as soon as they wash it
But the pride won't let em inside they like go get em
And I'm just like why you trying to fight momentum
We just keep winning by landslides oh an um
Shady Limiteds in any size yo denim to velour
Even our clothing lines on fire
As 50 would said our clothing lines on FIRE
Meanwhile your mind's on us like mine's on Mariah
And you all just like her your all fucking liars
But I'll just keep fucking you like I fucked her
Right in the ass with K-Y yessir
So full of joy boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you yeah boy don't curr

[Chorus]
See us on the award shows and we're like oh yeah
Can we get more of those they like oh yeah
See us keep blowing up we're like oh yeah
So Jimmy can crack corn but i don't care

See me in the videos I'm like oh yeah
See me ride up close your like ee-yeah
And where's G-Unit at they like we over here
And where the f*ck we goin we're like no where

[50 Cent]
Your homie got clapped on, man I don't care
The cops in my nana crip but I'm not there
It is what it is dog man life's not fair
Your friends should have known not to front 'round here
Listen kid where I'm from the wolves smell fear
They'll strip your ass of your jewels right here
Man I'm gonna say this one time and get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like out of no where
Beautiful day without drama is rare
Your girl's a freak man sometimes we share
Yeah I wear a condom and you go bear
You probably heard about me I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin' like I'm running for mayor
Running winding ?doning? and shining you know what I'm saying
I aint got time for fucking around and horse playing
I'm making hits my homies taking hits whose staying

[Chorus]
See us on the award shows and we're like OH YEAH
Can we get more of those they like OH YEAH
See us keep blowing up we're like OH YEAH
So Jimmy can crack corn but i don't care

See me in the videos i'm like OH YEAH
See me ride up close your like OH EAH
And where's D12 at they like WE OVER HERE
And where the fuck we goin we're like NOWHERE
