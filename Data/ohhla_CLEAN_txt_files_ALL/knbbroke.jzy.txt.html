Song:   Knob Broke
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I go to work, I do my job
I gets it in, I goes hard
Think I had too much to drink feel me God
Two time those, I broke the knob

[Chorus]
I bet you wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I bet you niggaz wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I bet these bitches wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I made these niggaz wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I made these bitches wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up [x4]

Homie just keep it real, I know what you was thinking
Between all the hate, the race and all that liquor you're drinking
You was probably thinking that I go out like a sucker
That's what you get for thinking you ignorant motherfucker
It's Jeezy J from the columns these rappers formerly busters
Post up certain clockers ain't used to damn the cuffers
Got no work from the mexicans used to damn the truckers
'Cause we taking that shit like it got caught up in customs
Bad bitches they lustin' real niggaz disgusting
See them taking them shout they bounce off of them it's nothing
Don't let this rap shit fool you, run up all on me bustin'
Don't let these rap niggaz fool you, that's the end of discussion
See I would die by this shit, and whatever that's worth
You niggaz step in my yard I go to war bout my terf
See, I'm one of the realest niggaz to walk on this surf
Nigga you heard what I said and that's the end of my hearse

[Chorus]
I bet you wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I bet you niggaz wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I bet these bitches wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I made these niggaz wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I made these bitches wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up [x4]

Nigga if you're about to issue then you know how I feel
Look dead in your eyes and let you know that it's real
I see these niggaz is faking so I'm a be realistic
See these niggaz is playing so let me kick the ballistics
Throw that brick in the oven bake that bitch like a biscuit
Way I weigh up this yolo you think I majored in physics
And I'm a stay sucker free that's right I'm gonna keep my distance
Can't form rhyme with these suckers I know that they're too experienced
If the sun gets trapping then I'm a head of the class
Heard you niggaz is broke, and you might need some cash
Guess some niggaz get money better, shit don't make 'em real
If you like good enough, you just might get you a deal
I'm the real of the real, real shit pay my bills
If I wouldn't rap it baby I'd be still counting mills
If I wouldn't rap it baby I'd be still total steel
See I made this shit yea, so I get turned off for real

I go to work, I do my job
I gets it in, I goes hard
Think I had too much to drink feel me God
Two time those, I broke the knob

[Chorus]
I bet you wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I bet you niggaz wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I bet these bitches wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I made these niggaz wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I made these bitches wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up [x4]</pre>
