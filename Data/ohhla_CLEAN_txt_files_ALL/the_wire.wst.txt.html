Yo G, they can't stop me from rappin can they? Can they ha?
I spit it through the wire man...
Just too much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll gladly risk it all right now...
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all ya- y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kayne to the....
Chi-Town what's goin on man
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I drink a - Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man be-serk
Not to worry Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she been tryin to be mine
She a Delta, so she been throwin that +Dynasty+ sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin, I been tryin to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire - HA! I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryin to +Make a Band+
I swear this right here, history in the makin man

I really apologize how I sound right now man
This ain't fair at all man
They got my mouth wired shut for like
I don't know the doctor said like six weeks
You know we had reconstru....
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror, half of my jaw was in the back of my mouth
Man I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for yall right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he's really puttin it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, Wrong time
in the blink of a eye - his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe, safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I looked like Tom Cruise on +Vanilla Sky+, it was televised
All they heard was in accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
"Unbreakable", what you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Yaknahmsayin?
When the doctor told me I had a um...
I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on my plane now?
Its bad I got all this jewelry on
You can't be serious man</pre>
