[Intro: Jimmy Smith sample]
"Good God Almighty.. like back in the old days. 
You know, years ago they had the A&amp;R men to tell you what to play
how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock
but, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last
All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow-w-w-w-w..."

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the, get the, get the, get the, get the, get the, get the, get the money
Dolla, dolla, d-d-d-d-dolla, dolla-dolla bill y'all (y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the, get the, get the, get the, get the, get the, get the, get the, get the, get the, get the money
Frikki-frikki-frikki, dolla, dolla-dolla bill y'all (y'all, y'all)

[Drake]
Yeah, uh, after hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talking women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapinos boostin' my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growing 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
or work with their parents; but thinking back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink/Inc I could +Murder+, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dawg
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Sean Don, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Uh, shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us
The homies said "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em less is more niggas, plenty of us

[Chorus] - first 1/2

[Jay-Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
{*pop*} They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icing on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just getting started, oh yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Bigg made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'll tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel</pre>
