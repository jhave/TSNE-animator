[Mack 10]
Hoo Bangin' and Cash Money
Hustlin' every Frday

[Baby]
Got a package on Wednesday, Thursday I broke it up
Now Friday done came, today we cookin' up
Ain't gettin' loaded nigga, no time for fuckin' up
I'm breakin' niggaz of with bricks from hust-a-lers
The hood done changed cause niggaz is comin' up
Ya short me, I'ma have to blow your hood up
The feds on my ass but I need my change
So I could ride Hummers, Jags and Bentleys man

[Manny Fresh]
It's that day, phat day
Kidnappin' and gun play
I need my riches from you bitches and I can't stay
Now that the flavor that I savor neighbor, 20 inch thangs
Rag on my head, white T-shirt and bagette chains
Mac like roni the one and only
Nigga Puff like Daddy and I'm pretty like Tony
Friday, lie day, tell the lil nigga I'll pay 'em
And when he come up with the product, ya'll niggaz spray 'em
Now why they
Had to do me on Friday

Chorus: B.G. (2x)

It's Friday, nigga on the block straight shinin'
Runnin' a bitch down, tryin' to get it I'm grindin'
Sellin' 2 for 1's what ever nigga I got it
Them checks came out so the set straight poppin'

[Lil' Wayne]
Listen, listen, listen, la
Weezy-We, movin' 20 ki's a week
On a good friday it's like easy street
Breakin' down whole chickens, to quarters and halves
You gould get it harded than slabs or softer than sand
If you come around my course nigga
Askin' for the short nigga
Not on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I be duckin' the law nigga
You know I got that raw nigga, bags to bricks
Whole things goin' for 10 and ounces for 6
Look it's iceberg nigga expect the worst
Friday done fell on the first and I got that work
And if I fron the whole thing, I'ma ask for 11
If I front a half a thing, I'm taxin' ya 7
Cause I gotta ride dubs nigga runnin' whatever
A CMR standard nigga got a flosser Kompressor
I got a extra 223, and my pockets to spend
And on the next Friday, I'ma do it again
Wha

Chorus: B.G. (2x)

[Mack 10]
Man first it was a hard night
And that was good Friday, I got to duck 'til I'm special on the hard white
I'm ridin' 20 inches, flossin', stay shinin'
I'm the boss, I get chickens at cost and stay grindin'
Don't make me put on the bass and so I'm bout to start hoopin'
I'll remake 2 out a 1 so I can get hootin' and recoopin'
My game gettin' strong and my profit gettin' long
I bust the whole chick down and sell it all in zones
Try to beat me or cheat me and get your shirt stained up
And run for pop those hollows towards the door and freeze your brain up
All hustlin' hit the stores and turn the flame up
Left the water bubblin' and rocked the caine up
So Baby, you Wayne and Fresh y'all get the machetes
Put it in B.G. cook it and y'all chop it when it's ready
And when you come to my hood and you lookin' for them thangs
Mack 10 is the name on the Caddy door now what

[Manny Fresh]
Why they
Had to do me on Friday
Why they
Had to persue on Friday
Why they
Had to do me on Friday
Why they
Had to persue on Friday
