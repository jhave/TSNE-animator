"Strange fruit hanging, from the poplar trees...
 Blood on the leaves"

[Kanye West]
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin since the summertime
Now I'm holdin down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'ma need a little mo' time now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin me
All want somethin out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it
So let's get on with it

We could've been somebody
'stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
when you tried your first molly
And came out of yo' body
And came out of yo' body
Runnin naked down the lobby
And you was screamin that you love me!
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
when I would hold yaaaaa
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
{"Strange fruit hanging"}
Somethin strange happening
{"From the poplar trees, from the poplar trees"}

Uh, uh, uhh
You could've been somebody
We could've, uh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
when we tried our first molly?
And came out of our body
And came out of our body

Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'Nolia
Fuck them other niggaz cause I'm down with my niggaz
Fuck them other niggaz cause I'm down with my niggaz
Fuck them other niggaz cause I'm down with my niggaz
I ride with my niggaz, I'd die for my...

[Interlude: sample of "Strange Fruit" by Nina Simone]
"Strange fruit hanging
 From the poplar trees, from the poplar trees..."

To all my second-string bitches, tryin to get a baby
Tryin to get a baby, now you talkin crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin lazy
She Instagram herself like "Bad bitch alert"
He Instagram his watch like "Mad rich alert"
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you're sittin courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night yo' heart died
Then you gotta go and tell yo' girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now yo' driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That going to that owe that money that the court got
All in on that alimony
Uhh, yeah yeah, she got you homie
Yeah, 'til death but do your part
Uhh, unholy matrimony

[Interlude: sample of "Strange Fruit" by Nina Simone]
"Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze! .. Breeze!
 Strange fruit hanging, from the poplar trees, from the poplar trees"

[Outro: Kanye singing auto-tuned]
That summer night, holdin all day long, day long
No waitin for the summer rose, and
And breathe, and breathe
And breeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeathe
And breathe and breeeeeeeeathe
And breathe and breeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeathe
And live and learn, and live and learrrrrn
And livin, and livin like I'm lonely, lonely, lonely
And livin all I haaaaaaaave
And livin allllllllll
And liiiiiiiiiiiiive!
And liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive!

{"Blood on the leaves... breeze! Breeze!"}
