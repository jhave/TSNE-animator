Jazzy Jeff &amp; Fresh Prince coming back at ya
A-ight now Jeff now come on let me do my thing
Gimme a scratch toss it let me do my thang
What What What
Back shaking the dust off
Knocking the rust off
Your highnesses
Philly's finesess
Back for the addict
The fanatic
The hype fan
Just me and Jeff tables and a mic stand
For those that wasn't down from the start
And don't realise the cuttin is a workin of art
Musical monet
All day to get down to yo
Let em know what DJ Jeff Townes do
*This Dj he gets down mixing records*
Round the block
Back in philly man the album was late
Gratitude instead a attitude for making ya wait
Time to retaliate against the players that hate
*I was giving you time to get the last one straight*
Brothers always screaming about keeping it real
Don't get no realer than the mic with your boy on the wheels
True dat yall can run but you cant escape he like a
*Man with a super S on his cape*
High supremacy
Based on chemistry
No need for sensing me
Your hennisee
Top dogs from the hood
Popping back to the hood
*I hate to brag but damn I'm good*
Yo Jeff it's been a minute since me and you ripped
But some of the ol diehards might have thinked that you flipped
I heard some guy implied that you lost your cut
How you respond to that Jeff
*Ha what?*
What's a rapper if his cuts don't fit?
*Nuthin*
And what's a DJ if his cuts don't hit Jeff?
*Nuthin*
Now whats a party if the crowd don't flip?
*Nuthin*
Well we can do it all baby
We can do it all baby
We can do it all baby
Just like this
*like this* (what)
Jazzy Jeff blaze
*Like this*</pre>
