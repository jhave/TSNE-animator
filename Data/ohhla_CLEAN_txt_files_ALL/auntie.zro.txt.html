Special shouts out goes to
My Aunt Sandra, and my Grandma Dorothy
My two favorite girls, you dig these blues

Coming up as a juvenile, 1983
Had no idea, the Lord would take my mom away from me
Cold part about it, I was only six when she died
Aunt Sandra and Grandma Dorothy, wipe the tears from my eye
Ever since I could remember, they've been guardian angels
Whenever life started choking me, they would loosen up the strangle
Wish I had a million dollas, I would hand it over
So I could see my Auntie in a Bentley, and my Gram's in a Range Rover
Who say, two women couldn't raise a man
They did everything, except put a pistol inside my hand
Taught me when to fight, and taught me when to walk away
The main reason, why I'm not outlined in chalk today
So many problems in my life, I'm glad they never left me lonely
Much more than my Auntie and Grandmama, y'all my homies
And can't nobody, ever take the place of my mama
But raising me was hard, so I thank God for my

Auntie and Grandmama
When I thought I wouldn't make it they
Brought me, through the drama
I don't know, what I do without
Auntie and Grandmama
When I thought I wouldn't make it they
Brought me through the drama

Daddy was around, but he stayed gone
Even when he was at home, he never stayed long
He was in the street, so I raised myself
Without his guidance he fell off, and almost played myself
I got put out the house, and started living like a hobo
Contemplating suicide, but Grandma said that was a no-no
Then Auntie came and picked me up, and gave me some bread
They gave me life, when everybody else done left me for dead
I was in jail sometime, but they know I'm not a crook
So they kept letters coming daily, and kept money on my books
I thank the Lord for em, can't nobody take they places
I just wanna make em happy, keep a smile on they faces
They deserve the world, the universe and the galaxy
For staying by my side, through all my hard times and tragedies
Can't nobody, ever take the place of my mama
But raising me was hard, so I thank God for my

Even though I got love, for all my family members
Only my two favorite girls, showed me love from December to December
So I'm showing love back, it's the least I can do
For being my parents, and seeing me through
We always had a lot of love, in that household
Didn't have a lot of food, but I never had to keep my mouth closed
Always had something hot, on my plate
A lot of times I was full, before my people even ate
Aunt Sandra and Grandma Dorothy, y'all my blood for life
Appreciate the way ya made sho' the word of God, touched me right
Cause I'm a God-fearing man, till I'm in my grave
Trying to make it to Heaven which y'all, no more sinning days
If I had wishes to make, I would give em to y'all
Because without your love, I would not be living at all
Can't nobody, take the place of my mama
But raising me was hard, so I thank God for my
