[Intro: Greg Street]
Aiyyo Kayslay man let's take it back down to the dirty south for a sec!!!

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
Shorty watch me pull up, pop out, somethin with the top out
Since the cops ain't out pop the trunk and let the knock out
One for my homeys, out here on the run
Two for my baby mamas out here stackin funds
Three for the ghetto kids postin on the block
Rest in peace to my nigga Fuller who got knocked
Fo' for them snitches, everywhere you go
Talkin to the cops yeah I know how they roll
Five for them bitches, settin niggaz up
Knowin they got a package and lettin niggaz fuck
Six for them go getters out there gettin bucks
Them young niggaz tryin to rob and end up gettin stuck
Now for them niggaz out there pushin big wheels
When they pop they collar pimp pussy for cheap thrills
Eight for them niggaz out there servin Fed time
You 'gon have to serve eighty five percent of your time
Nine for my homey who just made the headline
Robbed liquor stores got away with every dime
Ten for the strippers who know how to play it right
College by day but then get naked by night
Oh this ain't nothin special this is everyday life
These are a few things niggaz do out here to earn stripes

[Chorus: Yung Joc]
Shorty watch me pull up, pop out, somethin with the top out
Since the cops ain't out pop the trunk and let the knock out
Shorty watch me pull up, pop out, somethin with the top out
Since the cops ain't out pop the trunk and let the knock out

[Verse 2: Papoose]
How you 'gon tell me I ain't the best god damn you
I'm standin while all of the rest got cancelled
When niggaz was scared to make bets I gambled
Put it all on the line and yes I scrambled
The last time I performed my set got trampled
The ladies rushed the stage the rest got cheerful
Think about it I could of have let Bed-Stuy jam you
I told all of them niggaz they bet' not blam you
Control reckless niggaz yet I'm careful
And niggaz actin like they don't respect my handle
I put fire on wax just like candles
Way wiser than all of the rest on the panel

[Chorus: Yung Joc]
Shorty watch me pull up, pop out, somethin with the top out
Since the cops ain't out pop the trunk and let the knock out
Shorty watch me pull up, pop out, somethin with the top out
Since the cops ain't out pop the trunk and let the knock out

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Yeah yeah! Used to have a problem gettin money in my hands
Only problem that I got is findin bigger rubberbands
Damn, money clips don't fit when your a C.E.O.
See mine oh, for dough, so money that I'm greedy oh!
I stepped into the bank tryin to make a deposit
Over two hundred thousand she said baby I got it
Said she dugout the counter on the desk I can spot it
Was exactly correct, then I left and forgot it
Blame the brain gettin money ain't new to me nigga
Please it's like the leafs ain't nothin new to a tree
Believe it's like a sleeve ain't nothin new to a tee
At ease it's like a weave ain't nothin new to a she
We, generals pretend like you didn't know
Pretend like you can't get kicked right out of your Kenneth Coles
Tellin ya he I.D. like me when I'm gettin dough
Go and check his identity it isn't identical
Step on that hidden flo', we don't fall off
We don't hang with them type of niggaz others might call soft
Got you wonderin what the illest on the mic 'gon cost
Go get your checkbook then a check up cause it might cost cost

[Chorus: Yung Joc]
Shorty watch me pull up, pop out, somethin with the top out
Since the cops ain't out pop the trunk and let the knock out
Shorty watch me pull up, pop out, somethin with the top out
Since the cops ain't out pop the trunk and let the knock out
Shorty watch me pull up, pop out, somethin with the top out
Since the cops ain't out pop the trunk and let the knock out
Shorty watch me pull up, pop out, somethin with the top out
Since the cops ain't out pop the trunk and let the knock out</pre>
