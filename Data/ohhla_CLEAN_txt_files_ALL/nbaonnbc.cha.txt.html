[O.G. Ron C - Talking]
Play it..gon' break em' off something

[Chamillionaire]
-Uh
Treat me like a lawyer, the next time that you wanna book yo show
Cuz if you didn't send me my dough I'ma be a no-show
Slow-mo, you get screwed by ya label and ya DJ
While ya women gettin' screwed in the place where she brush her teeth mayne
And I ain't talkin' bout the bathroom, man she say
she love me, wanna see me again like I'm instant replay
We paid in full, it's the Color Changin' Click
Which car do I wanna drive? take a color changin' pick
Yall boys need to retire, go sit next to Bill Walton
Cuz while we ballin' y'all'a prolly be still talkin'
Garage like a B-Ball goal with the rims bent
If it don't get new rims, nothing's goin' in it
Blended, how my rims get..called for traveling
Even when the car is parked in the spot where I'm standin' in
The streets is raw, people peepin' ya car
Wish they..got what you got greedy people are
Not street ballers tryna hoop throwin up shots in the paint;
More like jackers tryna jack, shooting shots in ya paint
Street ballers slam dunk and try to take off the rim;
While jackers jack cadillacs and try to take off the rims
That's cold, but I'll be damned if I do my thug thizzle
I grind..while y'all whine like 3 kids with 1 skittle
Sweet-tooth, can't let a jacker get my candy
So we Swoop..like Sheryl wth the bang-bang handy
You can't walk around really thinkin' that lifes a sport
Spend half of the time sittin' around and half in court
Houston..Koopa gon' make the world accept this city
You must have warrants in every city, except this city
You ain't nationwide, you ain't in Chicago you ain't in Cali'
For a fee..I'll promote yo record, just holla at me
Chamillionaire, I be sayin what they scared to say
The Mixtape God, better get prepared to pray</pre>
