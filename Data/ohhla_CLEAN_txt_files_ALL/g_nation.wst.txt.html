[Nate Dogg]
Na na na na na na na na (Westside)
Na na na na na na na na (ohh ohh)
Na na na na na na na na (what what)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na (yeah yeah)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

[Chorus]
This day right here is really rough
These girls out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And in five beers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run it up
We still right here don't fresh your luck

[W.C.]
Homey I'm tired of the cowards parkin like this walkin like this
From the concrete when they chalkin' like this
And there he goes and a trick pose and a throw back
Holdin' a gack ain't gonna bust and know that
It's a dub ass C thang dub C brain
And we don't kick it but bust it and kaki jeans strains
I'm done movin I'm clearin the crowd
It's the who bangin bandana cri-mi-ni-mi-nal, the ori-gi-nal

[Mack 10]
Evacuate the building look here come a plane
No, it's the big bad Westside Connect Gang
And bump what you plain homey this who bang
With enough game to drive a swear broad insane
And we number one gunners no we ain't stunners
It's real with us partna, dealers and drug runners
And Mack need a? in a H2 Hummer
Lookin hotter than the South Central L.A. summer, let's go

[Chorus]
This day right here is really rough
These girls out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And in five beers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run it up
We still right here don't fresh your luck

[Ice Cube]
What the hell is Ice Cube talkin about
That's how you get these here parked in you mouth
Westside ride trick, the same old spit
I don't conversate with chicks I ain't goin hit
I don't holla at these pros that sing like Ashante
Body like Beyonce, face like Andre (uhhh)
You kinda but I'm with so my Andre got to be bomb rate

[W.C.]

Have you seen us, naw
Haters can't see us
Connect Gang we the G'est nigga
Countless calls and countless charges
Street niggas makin blunts out of Cuban cigars
Big by the linnas sip notic by the liters
With a flock of pros on us cause the cronic is
And to my G's incarcerated and on probation
I'ma stay bagin for the whole G Nation nigga

[Chorus]

Mack 10]
It's a Gangsta Nation if you in you a G
And the whole world influence by the b in the sea
Now tell the truth rappers you don't bow like me
Cause I'm really from the gang ya'll is industry
And while I'm servin up and comin young hustlas and gluckas
Bangin for the hood causin havic and ruckus
You fools actin label kissin up like suckas
And your trick solder down when you pee lil bustas

[Ice Cube]
One thing I do know I ain't the uno
Big puno rap sumo on pruno (you know)
I'd like to thank the congregation
In my affiliation to the Gangsta Nation
I'm hard on them, yeah I'm ruthless
You like a stress sac, boy you useless
You know the side trick, better get up on it
Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin on it

[Mack 10]
Look check this out man
We got a Gangsta Nation goin down over here
So ya'll might as well bow down
And join this Westside thang man
Cause once you get with this
Partna you as G as can be
Believe that homeboy
It's like that
Fred Red, what I'd tell you homey
It ain't a hit till Nate Dogg spit

[Nate Dogg + (Ice Cube)]
This day right here is really rough

We still right here don't fresh your luck
