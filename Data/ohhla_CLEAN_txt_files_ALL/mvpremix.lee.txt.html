[Benzino]
yo, this benzino, aka zino bonds
ya heard, breaking bread wit my dog stagga lee
nahmean
that remix is crazy MVP style
aiyo vice lets go

[Chorus]
when we rolling in the club we be like (la la la)
we got yall open on the floor be like (la la la)
we got the girls getting dirty like (la la la)
its just like (la la la) we be like (la la la)
cause you know we keep it burning like (la la la)
every girl round the world be like (la la la)
and MVP still winning like (la la la)
we be like (la la la) they be like (la la la)

[Verse One]
I make these cats kiss there nightlife's goodbye wit fly rhymes
thatpenetrate the pickiest minds leaving your blind
cause either I shine or I'm shady the poetic forensic
that plays your brain like Frasier crane
rightgame tight I top attendance on the same flight
I never freeze but depending on my chain
I might, dust off crumbs like Sara Lee
I'm stagga lee girls be watching me like calories
please believe, I be sixed up sexed up and x'd out too
in the cut licking the glue off a the big bamboo
or I'm playing footsy wit dimes under the table
wit my eyes panning under the navel, and pants label
please we use hoes please too roll trees
and blow like please on CD's fo more cheese
Y'all know Stagg', only trying to increase the O's
increase the (blow smoke), wit the hair in cornrolls
leave the stress out, double o three we keep the lead out
baby make like a fetus and head out, we singing la la

(Bridge 1)
yo we roll up in the spot like (la la la la la)
you know we making it hot like ( la la la la la)
get it bumping on every block like ( la la la la la)
stagg (la la la la la) bragg (la la la la la)
aiyo the beats keep staying wit ( la la la la la )
plus my team still winning like (la la la la la)
we upgraded to 19"s like (la la la la la)
re (la la la la la) mix (la la la la la)

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
now I told you when I roll up they like (la la la)
asking me for my autograph like I'm some kinda superstar
NO not feeling you bro, I'm killing ya flow
bacteria I'm so damn sick, and still yeah we got us a deal
I'm not sweating it for real
you want me on your record, calling Ted fields
my scripts so poetic, I spit lots cause I got a list
for dick fiends its cool so I deal with it
game I'm new to it, learn fast earner
tight plus I'm white, like saint mike jacks word turner
birds they got the body but I don't slang murder
I yearn to get the swerve with the V 12 burner
(la la la la)  get your boys box thumping
production fat like sacks and liposuction
notouching, stay on the pen dog no touching
you see me creeping on the sidelines waiting to bustin

(Bridge 2)
yo we roll up in the spot like (la la la la la)
you know we making it hot like ( la la la la la)
get it bumping on every block like ( la la la la la)
stagg (la la la la la) bragg (la la la la la)
the beats stay swinging wit (la la la la la)
and my flows stay fluid like (la la la la la)
this rap thing we do it like ( la la la la la)
re (la la la la la) mix (la la la la la)

[Chorus]

(Girl)
Aiyo you aint ready for me click (click click)
and when we rock hip hop yo its sick
not your plain ordinary, everybody hit the floor
MVP and we aint talking shhhhiiiiittttttt...</pre>
