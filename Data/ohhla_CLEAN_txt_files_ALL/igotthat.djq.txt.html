-Man, that nigga be perpin' like he a pimp and shit, you know what I'm

-If the bitch would've stepped to me I would have came at her something like this... 

[DJ Quik]
Yo, how would you like to spend sometime with DJ Quik, girl?
I know I'm better than good cus I rock your world
So come with me and you will see just what I'm all about
And I go straight to the moves so let me bust it out
I wanna grind and moan while I hold your hand
And girl we're both mature enough so we can dirty dance
Cus can't you see that I'm a player and I got to have it
Just like a rabbit, so c'mon baby let me grab it
I won't mislead you, just let me feed you
A nine-inch diggidy diggidy dickie all up in you
But you know-you know I do it right my name aint Sydnie
Get on your hands and knees and let me stab yo kidney
From the back
All over the intestinal track
Some call it ?butts'ha? but I call it the butt
And now you see that I'm a true, and girl you're so appealing
I wanna fuck you to the ceilin cus I got that feelin

Now that's how I come at her you know what I'm sayin?

[Teddy]
Man, I see you got a little mack daddy you know?

-A little mack? Nigga I got game, these bitches be on it
-Yo man, but you ain't prove nothin to me yet
-Yeah right, I'll prove it to you in the second verse though, now peep this

Love me... ahu ahu
Love me... 
Love me... ahu ahu
Love me... 

[DJ Quik]
Yo, I'm DJ Quik a player and a hustler too
So many girlies on my jock that I don't know what to do
I buy my jimmies by the cases and not by the packs
Because I knock so many boots I have to keep em in stacks
Now the fellas they get jealous, the ladies they get hot
Because they now that I'm player givin you all that I got
And in the sheets I'm a super lover that's what I said
I maybe Quik on the tables but I'm forever in bed
Because I grind it, and get behind it
And when my tape stops I get up and rewind it
I like to fuck it, I never suck it
And if you're dumb I get you sprung just like a cluck
Bitch, hey, DJ Quik is in effect for the 9-0 season
Skeasin is the reason, cus I'm so damn pleasin
Quik is the name and if you think that I'm appealin
Then go for what you know, baby, because I got that feelin

[Teddy]
Yo man I see what your sayin man

-Oh yeah, pimpin's just that simple
-I know man, you should pump that nigga AMG
-I know man, that nigga need some courage you know what I'm sayin? Cus we 
handle it, and we outta here

Love me... ah ahu
Love me... 
Love me... ahu ahu
Love me...
