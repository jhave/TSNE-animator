[Prince Ital]
Watch it, watch it - Daz is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
Watch it, watch it - Kurupt is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
Watch it, watch it - Doggystyle is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
You might be shootin, inna de place
Iffa eedyot ever disrespectin, nowww..

[Kurupt]
Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Think how many plots blossoms to how many times
I'm sedatin my asphixiated from beginnin broke
And the bombest weed smoke that'll make a nigga choke
To my loc's way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L.A. and the Beach
To my bulls out in Philly, cause all they smoke is phillies
With these silly-ass bitches out for a niggaz riches
Now really, will he ever slip or trip
A big shout out, to my niggaz in (?)Darby Twip(?)
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MC's like ships
With my nocturnal vibes and editorial clips
I got a click, that'll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catchin cases robberies and assaults
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that
Listen and get elevated off the verbal contact

[Bridge]
When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
Now when a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere

[Daz]
My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt 'em in the worst way, put it down for myself
Put 'em to rest, confess, nevertheless
Snatch 'em a cap and destroy 'em at my best
For the simple fact with contact, we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle I'll mistreat
Any MC tryin to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest, it could be a verbal massacre
in ninety-six, with a different approach on shit
I got the flavor, and I'm major
Busta-ass niggaz can't stop us, and can't fade us
Shady-ass niggaz can't stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya
Swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya
I betcha I won't let ya escape, face the real on point
They're trained to kill, beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area whether I'm toast(?) or at home
I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MC's try to step they get lit and blown

[Bad Azz]
At the end the lights go out so before they do
I'm a L-B-C on through, stayin true
Demandin my respect, respect is what I've given
So respect is what I expect, the money got me driven
to the point of no return - so the streets I roam
Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
.45 calibre Glock gat, gun, or pistol
Whistle, and watch all my homeboys come
Run, or hear the click, damn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust, I let loose
This is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it, but can't fade it
With they every attempt they fail,oh well
Consequences get suffered
I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
The bill is crisp (the deal is) the deal is this
I gotta plot 'em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
I'm stompin, steppin, with my projectile weapon

[Techniec]
With subjects all subject to harm, when I swarm through
Who knew about the real deal I conceal?
And still, can you feel, the topic of the whole situation is trust
No hoe is a must
If I bust my brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MC's who compose the violence
Bringin drama, with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived, somethin up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MC's'll be G's
Also D-P-G's and, L-B-C's when
we do the do to you so go call your crew
And who, wants to compete with Techniec
Conflict will be verbal, so watch how you speak
And what you say when I display
Sleepless acts that's bomb to ya, suffer from insomnia
And I'ma, gonna be comin for you
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew
(Watch out nigga!)

[Snoop Dogg]
It's a sucker MC barbecue cookout
Look out.. watch out now!
Ha-ha yeah, witcha bad self, watch out!</pre>
