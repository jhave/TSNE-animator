Song:   Unconditional Love
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
If you love me, love me unconditional
Patience is a virtue, then come residuals
These be the realest words I ever said [x2]
I'm a try to get to know you, not your physical
Gotta a bad habit can't be scared to let it go
These be realest words I ever said [x2]

[Verse 1]
Can't be a baby forever
You gotta crawl before you walk
Comprehend and then you talk
You might just fall, but don't fall off
You get back up and wipe it off
You gotta take it as a loss
You live and You learn and it ain't always yo fault
And we ain't always gone see eye to eye: ya compromise
And I just want you hold me down 3-65
With no complaining
Relationships get draining
I pray for my sanity
I'm tryna better my family
I'm standing here with blood, sweat, and tears
Don't get caught up in the fame, that's how we live
When you stay down and you wake up and your dreams right in front of you
They say success don't change you, it reveal you

[Chorus]
If you love me, love me unconditional
Patience is a virtue, then come residuals
These be the realest words I ever said [x2]
I'm a try to get to know you, not your physical
Gotta a bad habit can't be scared to let it go
These be realest words I ever said [x2]

[Verse 2]
How old you say you was? (college girl)
And you sweet too
I would introduce you to my sweet tooth
But I ain't get the chance to personally meet you
But I must say it was nice to meet you
And I hope you don't get offended
I'm in another state of mind right now
And I hope you understand I'm on my grind right now
My vision in a tunnel
Standin' in the jungle
I want to touch your heart but it's music every single summer
I wish you were my home girl
I miss my motherfuckin' uncle
He wanted to see this shit more than me nigga
I never would have been me nigga
I will be all I can be nigga!

[Chorus]
If you love me, love me unconditional
Patience is a virtue that come residuals
These be the realest words I ever said [x2]
I'm a try to get to know you, not your physical
Gotta a bad habit can't be scared to let it go
These be realest words I ever said [x2]</pre>
