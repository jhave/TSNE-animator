[Intro: samples and scratching]
"Swishahouse we cuttin the finest, two ladies on the covers now"
"Swishahouse we cuttin the finest, two ladies on the covers now"
"Swishahouse we cuttin the finest, two ladies on the covers now"
"Swishahouse we cuttin the finest, two ladies on the covers now"

[Mike Jones]
I keep that purple stuff, in my cup, diamonds shine from princess cuts
I stay on the grind, stackin bucks, I'ma major now fin' to fuck it up
Twenty-fo's when I roll up, purple drink gon' po' it up
Find a block then sew it up, you claim a set then throw it up
Like Lil' Jon I keep it crunk, got beef with me I'ma pop the trunk
Like Pastor Troy I'm "Ridin' Big," to the club, blowin skunk
I'm Mike Jones and I'm on the rise, 80 4's pokin out of my ride
My name alone can't be denied, my name alone can't be denied
2 8 1, 3 3 oh, eight zero zero fo'
Hit Mike Jones up on the low cause Mike Jones about to blow
2 8 1, 3 3 oh, eight zero zero fo'
Hit Mike Jones up on the low cause Mike Jones about to blow
If you don't work, you don't eat, you don't grind, you don't shine
So the next time you come up to me and ask how I blew put that on yo' mind
If you don't work, you don't eat, you don't grind, you don't shine
So the next time you come up to me and ask how I blew put that on yo' mind

[Chorus 2X: samples]
"You got drank, well po' it up; you claim a set then throw it up"
"You got drank, well po' it up; you claim a set then throw it up"
"You got drank, well po' it up; you claim a set then throw it up"
"You got dank let's blow it up, when my album stop I'ma slow it up"

[Mike Jones]
You know me, I'm 'bout that paper, no time to deal with haters
Screens fall in Navigators cause Mike Jones a paper chaser
I hater I will erase if he come trippin to my face
Back then look in my do' I was flippin yapes for the papes
I swang from lane to lane with one hand on the woodgrain
The other hand on my cup, sippin that purple stuff
H-Town Houston Texas we jam music screwed up
You better throw your shades on when I show my princess cuts
Cause I - used to hustle hard on my block, laws got hot so I shook the spot
Started rappin to stack a knot, 7 months later name got hot
Now I'm fin' to take it to the top I'ma run this shit when my album drop
So all you haters hatin on me, thanks a lot y'all helped me out

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones]
I come through on all 4's, Cartier tic-tac-toe
Candy red with the butter flows I got friends but mainly foes
I got candy color on butter non-stoppers I call 'em cutters
From 12 to 12 I'm a hustler that came up, from a struggle
I hustle from noon to night, when I step in a room you see ice
I'm on my grind puttin it down so I can live my life right
I stay on the scene, lookin clean, 24's roll while I'm droppin screens
Befo' I got a major deal I was underground stackin green

[Chorus]</pre>
