(King Tee is back again)

(Let's dance
I know you got the feeling
Let's dance
Come on and get down)		--&gt; Sweet Tee

[ VERSE 1: King Tee ]
Now what I want y'all to do is...
Think of this, then relax yourself
Then add to the pressure felt
I want all of y'all to motivate your self-esteem
Then pinch (Ouch...) See, this ain't no dream
It's the King, and I came to the place to
Start the party, give a little taste to
Suckers, punks and souped up chumps
They ought to know now, I love rappin to funk
So I recommend this, I insist this
Get out your seat before you all miss this
Dancin tune made to rock the room
Grab a partner (Come on!) and swoon
To the right, and I might
Say a little rhyme, so suckers, don't bite
Grab yourself a girl while I freelance
No mumbo jumbo, so handle that and...

(Let's dance
I know you got the feeling
Let's dance
Come on and get down)

[ VERSE 2: King Tee ]
Back once more with somethin funky
They tried to beat me and tried to punk me
But - it couldn't happen
Never, no way, no how, so don't be actin
Souped just because you're down with the group
I sit on your face and I poop
But don't get me wrong, I'm not that type of fellow
I like to make people dance, and I tell ya
I could be a choreographer, a teacher
A producer, or a preacher
More like a pro cause I do my trade well
I got a formula, but I can't tell
But what I wanna do is make you swing
To a funky beat brought by a King
So you know what to do, take a chance
Grab a freaky-deaky and...

(Let's dance
I know you got the feeling
Let's dance
Come on and get down)

(Let's dance)

(Where's the party at?
The party's over here!)

(Compton)

(Where's the party at?
The party's over here!)

(Compton)

(Let's dance
I know you got the feeling
Let's dance
Come on and get down)

(Do the hoochie-coochie)

(Fellas, I'm ready to get up and do my thang
Doin it, you know?)	--&gt; James Brown
