[Intro-Talib Kweli]
Dave, this a monster

[Chorus-Talib Kweli]
When them boys wit the Tec's throwin' up they set
And the spot so hot the ceilin' start to sweat
Yeah, that's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The...
When you just a little tipsy, you lookin' at them lips
And you lockin' up them hips, get the drillin' wit the tips, and
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The...

[Verse 1-Papoose]
Knowledge is the founder of everything in existence
If you not droppin' knowledge about us it's 'cause you ig'nant
A top-notch scholar wit honors, I'm so gifted
Live is the most vicious, honest and prolific
I drop diabolical brollic wit no gimmick
Astonish the flow critics, rhyme wit the most lyrics
I paint pictures, jot it and dot it but won't print it
My ? is photogenic, I am the most vivid
Man, I got a brain the size of the most biggest
Wide as them cold rivers, wise as them old niggaz
Tired of this, though, half of you rhyme it but don't live it
Watch it and go spit it, stop it, I know Physics
Breakin' yo physical, demolishin' yo spirit
The struggle got me thinkin' demonic and so wicked
Man, I'm so deep I'm bottomless, yo, kill it
Wise wit the flow, rhyme about Hymen, it's so senseless

[Chorus-Talib Kweli]
When them boys wit the Tec's throwin' up they set
And the spot so hot the ceilin' start to sweat
Yeah, that's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The...
When you just a little tipsy, you lookin' at them lips
And you lockin' up them hips, get the drillin' wit the tips, and
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The...

[Verse 2-Talib Kweli]
Live New York rap, stay away from the pork crap
Actin' like you all that, get smacked if you talk back
Spiritual like Rakim on ice, like Kane with the females
Slick Rick and Biggie Smalls attention to detail
Political like PE, I'm spittin' fire like Ice Cube
Kweli a nice dude 'til you start fuckin' with my food
Rap 'll set the right mood, fin' to blow like a light fuse
You might lose, ya chance of winnin' slimmer than a size two
Plus, the shit you kick so wack niggaz ready to fight you
Fuck rap, you better off wit spoken word kickin' Haiku
Or rhymes got teeth that'll bite you, make it clearer than white booze
You ain't special, there's a million rappers like you
Far from clumsy, but I drop lines and spill bars
Smoke more trees and be around more Black chicks than Bill Maher
Peel a card off the deck, this that real hard Hip-Hop shit
Niggaz feel y'all, it's real, y'all

[Chorus-Talib Kweli]
When them boys wit the Tec's throwin' up they set
And the spot so hot the ceilin' start to sweat
Yeah, that's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The...
When you just a little tipsy, you lookin' at them lips
And you lockin' up them hips, get the drillin' wit the tips, and
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The...

[Verse 3-Talib Kweli]
The Beast is out when the police is out
They be pullin' out and really showin' you what peace/piece about
Upholdin' the law that's designed to keep my people down
Bourgeois niggaz walkin' around like everything is equal now
I'm peepin' how from the beat cop to the Interstate trooper
To the Feds who put a price on the side of head of Cuba, B
Protectin' the property value over the people life
To take action against a foul government is the people right
But not too many ready to fight
It's like you'd rather be at home watchin' a flick or a fight
Or maybe Nick-At-Nite
It's sick how I'm addicted to mics, become a flickerin' light
After I spark I'm always ready to write
Where I'm from, they be watchin' us, but we be watchin' them
And bust shots 'til the coppers bring the choppers in
The squad cars try to box me in
But I got knowledge of self and it's stronger than any cage you can lock me in

[Chorus-Talib Kweli]
When them boys wit the Tec's throwin' up they set
And the spot so hot the ceilin' start to sweat
Yeah, that's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The...
When you just a little tipsy, you lookin' at them lips
And you lockin' up them hips, get the drillin' wit the tips, and
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out

[Outro-Talib Kweli]
A lot of different Beasts or demons roamin' the planet
And they surface at any given time
You never know when they can surface and come right up out of you
No matter how righteous you think you are
Situation could go down when you forced
To let The Beast out</pre>
