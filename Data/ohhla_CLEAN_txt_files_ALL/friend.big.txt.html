[Intro]
No...
Fuck the bitches, fuck all the stank-ass hoes, all my niggas know
Junior M.A.F.I.A. click, Gucci Don, you know how we play
Fuckin skanless-ass bitches; you know how it go Boots
I meet a bitch, fuck a bitch
next thing you know you fuckin the bitch
You just pass it around and shit, pass the shit like a cold and shit Fuck 'em

[Verse 1]
Now when I'm fuckin off gin I'm invincible
Don't love no hoe, that's my priciple
cause uh, bitches come [and uh] bitches go
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fuckin do'
[You know] they might be the one to set me up
Wanna get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote Tecs and stuff to get 'em off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough, to catch the bus
and when I see the semen I'm leavin
Bitches be schemin, I kid ya not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One hoe said, "Big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?"
Thug nigga 'til the end, tell a friend bitch
Cause when I like ya, then ya go and fuck my friend bitch
[And you know that ain't right]

[Chorus - repeat 4X]
You know that ain't right
With a friend of mine

[Verse 2]
You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep 'em in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
[Yeah we know, drop the scenario]
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knockin' some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the Gee's obsolete
Don't sleep!  Banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rappin' to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got Gee
Now she fuckin him and fuckin me, see
You know that ain't right

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Uh...now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruisin up the block, I be passin her
Pimpin hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, schemin on a gang-bang
She should've used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's sayin I dissed her 'cause I'm fuckin her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh
But she started that fuckin family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit yo' nasty ass

[Chorus]</pre>
