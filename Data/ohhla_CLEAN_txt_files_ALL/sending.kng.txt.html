[Tracy Lane]
Yeah
Said I don't want nobody else
Ooh babe

[Verse 1]
Yo I'm sittin back
Writing this letter of love
To confess what I feel now
Want you to know you the one (the one)
Girl you the world in my life
Indeed I need you
Cuz no one is more true
I wish you knew
The way you make me feel
When you give me them soft kisses
They give me the chills (chills)
For reals
Your soft touch can reveal so much
What fills love when it's real?
I visualize walking places with you
Holding your louis vuitton purse
Wearing lucky perfume
Holding hands &amp; watching your smile
Makes me feel I have a treasure
That it's never been found

[Chorus: Tracy Lane]
I'm sending you this message
Sending this message
Just to let you know
Just how much I love you
So much I love you
There ain't nothing
That can change the way
That I feel about you (you)
And now we alone
I can't believe
Just how much I want you (I want you)
Cuz girl I love the way you make me feel
When you call my name

[Verse 2]
Really know something
That you need to know mami
My love is growing
And it's never gonna be stopping
Picture a perfect night
Me &amp; you
Sitting by a fire
Playing r. kelly love tunes
Hugging, loving
Floats across the room
Kisses were the passion
I'm feeling something I love from you
You so incredible
So understandable
I don't have to worry about jealous scenarios
They always say
That love is based on trust
And if you ain't got none
Can't nothing be good for us
But it's different
Cuz I be out with my dogs
Doing what we do
Without getting your calls
Trying to trip
Saying oh who you with?
Just cuz you're with your friends
You pretend to be someone you never been
Leaving me ways
Attaching me more
That's why my love with you
I'll always enjoy

[Chorus: Tracy Lane]
Sending this message
Sending this message
Just to let you know
Just how much I love you (yeah)
There ain't nothing
That can change the way
That I feel about you
And now we alone
I can't believe
Just how much I want you (I can't believe it no)
Cuz girl I love the way you make me feel
When you call my name

[Verse 3]
Your friends say don't be with a gangsta
It's a waste of time
And for sure lil playa
My love is way stronger than that
You gonna see
That our love is meant to be
For a fact nothing will ever change
I really do embrace
You caring every day
Cuz your heart is to me like everything
And when times get rough
You're there for me
Filling my heart with love
When it was empty
It's been hard to trust in my life
But it seems a girl takes over your mind
Will they understand?
And really care for you?
And they sharing special moments
Just like you do
Never thought it would be like this
It feels good
To have a girl by my side
Like we all should
I hope you realize
All these written lies
Is meant for you to stay in my life girl

[Chorus: Tracy Lane]
Sending this message
Sending this message

Just how much I love you (I love you so much)
There ain't nothing
That can change the way
That I feel about you
And now we alone
I can't believe
Just how much I want you (I want you)
Cuz girl I love the way you make me feel
When you call my name

[Chorus: Tracy Lane]

Just to let you know
Just how much I love you
There ain't nothing
That can change the way

And now we alone
