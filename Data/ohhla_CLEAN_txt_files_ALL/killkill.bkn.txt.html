[Intro]
Afro Samurai, die die die
Afro Samurai, kill kill kill
Afro Samurai.. Afro Samurai.. kill kill kill
Afro Samurai, die die die
Afro Samurai, kill kill kill
Afro Samurai, die die die
Afro Samurai, KILL KILL KILL
Afro Samurai, die die die
Afro Samurai, kill kill kill
Afro Samurai.. Afro Samurai

[Rugged Monk]
The swiftness of my sword is an understatement of my art of war
A pleasure without conscience, feeds me, to want more
Principles of karma, death before dishonor
Shadows my eyesight procedes me to fight harder
For the number one headband, stand alone as one man
Afro Samurai can be defeated by no clan
A warrior of the street through my travels of land
In any shape form or fashion, kill the streets dramatic fashion
Become unpredictable when I strike there's no missin you
My aim is too precise, move forward and real pivotal
Take sips of lemonade, take lives with my blade
Revenge my father's death 'til I reach my final days

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Kill kill kill, Afro Samurai
Die die die, Afro Samurai
Kill kill kill, Afro Samurai
Afro Samurai.. Afro Samurai

[Rugged Monk]
I'm walkin out my nightmare drenched in cold sweats
Reminiscin of the night I killed my master for the headband
All the bloodshed and the murder, to revenge my father's murder
The thought of that alone can I really handle the bourbon?
So I choose my own path, no friends, no joy, no love
Just a number two headband, AND the man above
So the moves I create is my own unique vision
Strike my subconscious mind, individual essence
The most masterful opponent, will fall victim to my weapon
The most masterful opponent, will fall victim to my weapon
I'm not immortal, real aggressive, attitude is rude
I got a knack for killin and I refuse to lose

[Chorus]

[Chorus] - whispered to fade</pre>
