{*sighing*} Yo let me get a cigarette son
Yeah, fuck it, {?} it's not that serious
Hey yo

[Chorus]
She said she all fed up
And she talk about she lea-vin (aiyyo calm down)
Said she won't, be back
'Til we get e-ven (what'chu mean get even)
Said she gon' take, my kids
To her momma's for the wee-kend (yeah aight)
I know she try to be there for me
It's fucked up I got caught cheat-in

[Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo, I ain't gon' lie, I got weeded all drunk and I cheated
After the club, shorty gave me what I needed (yeah)
That freaky side in the back of a ride
In the back of the park, where we used to hide (oh)
First it was a fling cause I kept her in the wing
She knew I had a wife cause I kept her on my ring
But she ain't even care, she just wanted to be down
And come around the lab when I lay a song down (right on mami)
And even when I seen her with my lady
She'll walk by, I'll walk by, no actin shady
No prank calls, no baby momma brawls (none of that)
Real grown lady like, up in the malls
This whole thing is like way too good
You almost never catch a shorty like that up in the hood (uh-uh)
So I kept it on the hush (yeah) brought me a bat line
And called shorty up when it was time to crush

[Chorus] w/ slightly different ad libs

[Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo - couple of Louis bags, the kind that J-Lo has
Could be just lookin at the picture, she don't gotta ask
(You want that right there?)
I like to spend the cash, she like to throw that ass (turn around ma)
I remember when she first flew first class (calm down)
I let her push the whip in, until she started flippin
Axin me am I messin with some other chicken
I'm like "WHOA, baby NO NO NO"
This ain't gon' start (uh-uh) and please be smart
You know I got a girl, what'chu care what I do
She like "Fuck you Sheek, whatever, we through" (whatever)
Next day she drivin by, smilin and wavin hi
Right in front of my house, what this bitch wanna die?

[Chorus] w/ slightly different ad libs

[Sheek Louch]
Hey yo, yo, I never thought it would go down like this
This bitch got my baby momma suspicious
My door ringin while she doin the dishes
A dozen roses with a note sayin "kiss"
Wait 'til I see this witch
She got me on the couch like a muh'fuckin slouch, I'ma kill this bitch
I'm on AllNightParties dot com
Son lookin at like that's not mom!

[Chorus] w/ slightly different ad libs

[Sheek Louch]
I never thought it would go down like this
Bitch got my baby momma suspicious</pre>
