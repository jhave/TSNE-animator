[Sticky's talking]
See the way I got it figured the fucking whole world revolve around me
How you figured that? How you figured the world revlove around you?
When I get shot dont nobody feel that shit except for fucking me
If Idie the world is over
The world revolve around me just like the world revolve around you

[J. Blanco] I got you
[Sticky F.] Oh shit... yo, turn the mic up
[J. Blanco] Let these niggaz know what we talk about here

[Chorus:]
[J. Blanco] If you could see through my eyes, what would you see?
[Sticky F.] And if you'd seen what I saw, how would it be?

[Sticky]
Ain't nothin I ain't seen with this pair of eyes
I've seen niggaz get beaten 'til they was paralysed
I've seen enough fighting to get this whole room high
Seen enough death to make the fucking whole world cry
I've seen cops on the take supplyin blocks for weight
I see niggaz who don't care bust shoots at Jake
I've seen bitches at the club getting toxicated
When they awake can't count how many cops she hate
You think the shit that happeneds to me affects you too

[J. Blanco]
Hell no, 'cause you world revolve around you

[Sticky]
And my world revolve around me
You ain't did what I've done

[J. Blanco]
And you ain't seen what I've seen

[Sticky]
For everybody time moves different, for me it's b-ball
Some niggaz see their world behind a cell and 3 walls
Some niggaz can't see it at all
Some niggaz still in the dark
Some niggaz armied out smoking crows in the park

[Sticky's singing]
If you get shot, hear, your moms'll cry
But she wouldn't feel the pain that you feel inside
I want the world to go black I just close my eyes
And the day the world ends is the day I die

[Chorus]

[J. Blanco]
See, in this thug-shit when the guns go it's like time stand still
I've seen bullets move at them rapidly attacking their grill
So try to duck down and chill, adrenaline rushes, a second's eternity
Flesh burning, a four-five I lift and I'ma turn at them
Bleedin intrnaly two in the throat, one in the lung
I've seen them trying to studder words having a seizure biting his tounge
I've seen my man down on the clod pavement left to die
Look in to his eyes caught chills seeing his soul in the sky
Seen the four-fours of outlaws barking at boys
They say it's death when rain comes, it's pouring cats and dogs
I see motherfuckers thinking like they got nine lifes
Got shot 9 times left behind their kids and their wifes
Through my eyes define, real, what's the money you touch
The fast life's a world of matrix eanbles us to touch
I can slide aside a killers mind and show you his sins
See I'm deep with the street like murdurer with blood on his Timbs

[Chorus]

[Sticky]
If you get shot, hear, your moms'll cry
But she wouldn't feel the pain that you feel inside
I want the world to go black I just close my eyes
And the day the world ends is the day I die</pre>
