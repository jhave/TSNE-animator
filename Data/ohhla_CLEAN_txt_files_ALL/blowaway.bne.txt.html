[Intro]
Yeah, it's Bizzy and Layzie Bone up in here dog
(Gangster, I'm a gangster, and I'm ready to roll)

We gonna ride, we gonna roll (I'm a gangster, and I'm ready to roll)
(I'll blow your soul away-e-yay-e-yay-e-yay)

We gonna ride, we gonna roll (I'm a gangster, and I'm ready to roll)
(I'll blow your soul away-e-yay-e-yay-e-yay)

We gonna ride, we gonna roll (I'm a gangster, and I'm ready to roll)

[Bizzy]
Puttin' a pistol to my brain, one second before I squeeze since I'm
A gangster, I'm a put myself on my knees, I'm to many suicide I'm
Sick, of feelin' depressed, and I'm stressed out like a mothafucker
I can't even rest, I smoke weed, drink liquor just to ease the pain
They used to tell me that God was cryin' whenever it'd rain, I
Grew up without my momma and my father, just me and my sisters, and
They split us all up with the foster, I've been molested and I learnt
About love, I don't respect women, now I'm just sinnin', nigga row
I'm livin', how long may this survive like this, if it's Heaven and
The Abyss you will fry to the crisp now drinkin', and drinkin' and drinkin'
And smokin' and smokin' and thinkin' and thinkin' want a little bit
More and more a my mind still slip a, it's ridical can't take it, come on
Save me I'll take death everybody's so all worked up, Satan

[Layzie]
Ah shit, who put 'em in the wind, nigga better move I'm finna get started
Little L-Burna from the "Land of the Heartless" strapped with a nine
Don't make me spark it, you probably heard the news, if not you need
To check it, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony done broke away from Useless Records
We independent now, this shit ain't funny now, get so much money now
When I'm runnin' away it's goin' down, roll or get rolled over partner
Number 1, nigga that's my nine and when in stores ghetto boy nigga gimme
Them all, that's my game, no disrespect but I run with the best of the
Best, (Bizzy) from the north to the south, from the north to the south
To the east to the west, some dead from west, nigga don't need no vest
Don't stress, we want it all, and nothin' less, no nothin' less

[Hook]
We gonna ride, we gonna roll (I'm a gangster, and I'm ready to roll)
(I'll blow your soul away-e-yay-e-yay-e-yay)

We gonna ride, we gonna roll (I'm a gangster, and I'm ready to roll)
(I'll blow your soul away-e-yay-e-yay-e-yay)

We gonna ride, we gonna roll (I'm a gangster, and I'm ready to roll)
(I'll blow your soul away-e-yay-e-yay-e-yay)
