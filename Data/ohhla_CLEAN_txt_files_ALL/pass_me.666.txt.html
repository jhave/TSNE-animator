[Chours] 2x
Pass me da mutha-fuckin' blunt mane
Hurry up or else somebody's gonna get sprayed
Caugh and choke on the weed is just what I do
Caugh and choke on the weed is just what I do
 
[Crunchy Black]
Smoke dis, smoke dat, smoke weed, smoke crack
Everybody gettin' high, high off they fuckin' sac
Everybody know me, know me by Black
Black be smokin' weed mane, smokin' weed by da stack
Got dis, got dat, got swishers, got blacks
Got dat smoked out no doubt, bumpin' on the fuckin' track
Gonna get high mane, roll to get high mane
Smoke till I die mane, ain't no fuckin' thang
I'ma smoke till I die, I'ma break down that swisher
I'ma fill it up wit weed, I'ma blow it like a mista
Ain't no smokin' wit me mane, ain't no smokin' wit me mista
When you leave here dawg, you gone leave here in blistas'
You gone have to pull ya pistols because ya high and ya smooth
And ya think we mix our weed with some god damn eww (hey!)
You must be tootin', tootin' on that fruit in ya cell (man!)
Nigga the only thang I mix my weed with is god damn cell
