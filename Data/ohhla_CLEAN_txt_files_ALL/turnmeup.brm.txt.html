(Barking) Yea, turn me up some
Fuck goin on, Yo over there, what up brother
Yea, yea
Flipmode!
See we got a whole...
We got a gift wrapped package for you motherfuckers
Yea, yo, yo, yo, yea

(verse one)
Busta,I stay with in a nigga tracks so
Hotter than wax yo so tell me why you act so
Yo, I max cuz I make a nigga black till its time to relax yo
Untill you all collapse so, fuck it
Its hardly that the god is getting tired, you don't wanna say that
Can catch a cardiac relax nigga
What, the god is back so you dont wanna in no matter how you react
Blows your black and blue your front and your back
Choose, whatever the round that you choose
wounds so herendous from projects you get to analyzing the bruise
Blows will never come in singular they coming in twos
My crew be starting the ruckus once I get them accused
Or blast from the triggers that will bust from all of my dudes
be the shit that make you niggas run up out of your shoes
We make you back down, havin the facts now
With all the noise you be making you can even see the shit on the news
Murder

(chorus)
So you don't know nuthin about it (barking)
Turn me up some
Yo, the heat from of the street will burn you up some
Yo, the shit I'm sure to spit will hurt you up some
I'm sayin
But you don't know nuthin about it (barking)
Turn me up some
Yo, I drink a fith of yack and hurl it up some
Yo, just bang it in the truck and turn it up some
I'm sayin...

(verse two)
Now watch me get a nigga fast, like them bitches with no ass
You corny niggas no class
Yo, I flash on them then I go and smash
Couple holes and then splash on them, flicking a little ash on them
From the blunt we smokin keep it chick chokin
Got them open with flows I suppose and make them soakin their clothes
Keep the shit that make them sniffin, make them open their nose
got them fucked up stuck just like they striking a pose
Yo, we gaining weight nah its just my pockets are swole
From keeping niggers whilein while they drivin smacking the pole
I want to you see, prerhaps while I hold me a stack
hating niggas blab holding me back
Yo, you fool niggers plotting against the god
Must be holding a strap
Because how we coming through you know its a wrap
Moving a crew of gorrilla dudes you know when to clap
I blow some shit from of of the earth or the face of the map
Yo, so take that
Once we give it to you aint no faking or jack
It's funny how you find your face in a trap
Little bitch nigga fronting like he ready to scrap
You better off acting pussy trying to give me your dat
Staying focusd overfiling a dream
The way we spark up this bitter fire the flame probably killing your   team

Fuck it, so now we hover helicopters, turn this shit up
And you and your peoples aint hearing me proper
I'm sayin...


(chorus)
So you don't know nuthin about it (barking)
Turn me up some
Yo, the heat from of the street will burn you up some
Yo, the shit I'm sure to spit will hurt you up some
I'm sayin
But you don't know nuthin about it (barking)
Turn me up some
Yo, I drink a fith of yack and hurl it up some
Yo, just bang it in the truck and turn it up some
I'm sayin (im sayin I'm sayin I'm sayin I'm sayin)</pre>
