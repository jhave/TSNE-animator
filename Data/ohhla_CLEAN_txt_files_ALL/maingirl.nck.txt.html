Typed by: AZ Lyrics

N-I-C-K C-A-N-N-O-N (I'll make you mine)

Can I be your main girl? (Of course you can)
Can I be the one for you (Uh, it's Nick Cannon)
Can I be your main girl? (Of course you can)
Let me be the one, you believe in (Haha, yeah. Ha, it's like this. What)

Yo it's rule number one
If you wanna be my main girl
Gotta keep your hair tight
Toes right, yeah girl
You gotta be a girl who
Has a lot of virtue
Like to party in the club
But she go to church too
I need a chick who jet skis, sky dives, surf too
Boo you spit a verse too?
Nah, I don't deserve you
Yo I gotta have a chick that's with a Blockbuster night
When we caught up in some beef
On a Blockbuster fight
Additude is heavy pullin' stunts out of spite
Yo even when she heated
Shorty cussin' light
36-24-38, Ha, give or take
Nah, her size don't matter
Goals and ambitions gotta be a go-getter
Prada in the summer and Gabbana in the winter
If you fit this description of the girl in this rhyme (I'll make you mine)

Can I be your main girl? (Of course you can)
Can I be the one for you (Uh, it's Nick Cannon)
Can I be your main girl? (Of course you can)
Let me be the one, you believe in
(Haha, uh uh, haha, uh)

Yo I'm lookin' for a co-star
Tryin' to keep you closer
In my holster, like a thoroughbred supposed to
Uh, I need a J-Lo chick
Not worried about Puff, Chris, or Ben Affleck
Yeah, I did a few flicks
My chicks above average
No bad habits, no baggage from past trips
Workin' real hard part time taking classes
Girl I gotta give you credit
So, here's my plastic
Yo, I need a chick that won't take Nick for granted
A high class miss, like 5 Mics,A classic
You wanna be my main girl? Roll in the Range, girl?
In the rain girl?
Someone to take my name girl

N-I-C-K C-A-N-N-O-N (Oh you better sing girl)
If you fit this description of the gitl in this rhyme
(I'll make you mine)

Can I be your main girl? (Of course you can)
Can I be the one for you (Uh, it's Nick Cannon)
Can I be your main girl? (Of course you can)
Let me be the one, you believe in
(Haha)

Yo, can I get a main girl
Someone who can hold me down
City chick, southern bail
Educated, college bound
Put you in the hottest gown
In the hottest part of town
Move in, make love, sparks fly, burn it down
12 dozen rows of roses, for Valentines
Birthdays, teddy bears, this the girl I'm tryin to find
Spend a little time with
Tell me if my rhyme hit
Someone I can shine with
Cookin with my mom chick
Booby you the finest, your tenderness, your kindness
Money ain't a thing, keep the change
You a dime chick
So, get the ring, I'm the king
You the highness
Pre-nup, Hold up
First you need to sign this
East side, west side
South to the north
Block to block, and coast to coast
If you fit this description of the girl in this rhyme
(I'll make you mine)

Can I be your main girl? (Of course you can)
Can I be the one for you (Uh, it's Nick Cannon)
Can I be your main girl? (Of course you can)
Let me be the one, you believe in</pre>
