[Verse 1]
Look I'm on a war path
Tell the opposition
Naw keep it to your self, I'm my only competitions 
But keep the hate coming 
I love the criticism 
But understand I'm successful by my own admission
I never had shit 
But a bad bitch 
Naw let me stop lying mostly they was average 
If you'd say my voice would be heard by the masses 
A dust head nigga from jerz I wouldn't grasp it 
Questions you can ask it 
Teamed up with the classics 
Working on a classic, smash hits, and that's it 
Maybe niggas thought my knees gonna buckle
Newport in my mouth with two g's on the buckle
Got more now then them few g's when I hustle
Spanish broad with them two d's like I love you 
But sexy lady it was nice to know you gotta move on 
They can't chink my armor a nigga to strong 
I think niggas is shady but the proofs gone
I put the jewls on case fools thought it was gone you've been warned

[Verse 2]
I tried to told dudes way back in 02 
That eventually the game would go back to being soul food
I mean soulful while everything is woeful 
I try to stay fresh like whole foods on the pro tool
But Mista F-A-B wanna mention him 
Fell the fuck off I won't mention him  
Only respect one Fab and I'm friends with him 
Phonte back out I guess nigga pumped sense in him 
They when in pumped slugs in my little brother 
But dog I still love little brother 
This other guy ain't know whose dude 
Got glued to you tube I hit jin asked him if he digested his food smooth
How you beef with Joey did queer with out ears to say he ain't show out of fear
Heclif ain't scared of the old me 
The nerve of the young fork
Yosemite Sam is getting gun hoe 
Nigga bank account got one o
He could snort lines with his dick and won't come dope 
They stringing you along 
Don't take it and try to jump rope 
Dog this how you know you shouldn't feel glory 
Cause I ain't even show and end up being the story I'm sorry 

[Verse 3]
Mic check
I need it to be known 
I'm grown
I'm on some next shit 
I'm thinking oil money, Texas
Not a necklace 
You gotta to shot at mom dukes
Before the techs spit
I don't go out looking for drama like the feds did 
Music with a message 
But I'm no back packer 
Some vengefulness in me 
But I'm no back stabber 
No baller in the strip clubs I'm throwing cash at her 
I'm trying to help shorty and her goals attach faster 
Was insecure growing up 
Niggas laughed at her 
Now she things she got some self worth because her ass' fatter 
I told her give yourself the hay suss so 
Next time that chain you up you can brake through those 
Nigga call you out your name mommy break dude nose 
Gotta get you where you going might take you slow 
Maybe bend 
But never let'em make you fold 
Except your short coming baby 
They gone make you whole 
I'm gone</pre>
