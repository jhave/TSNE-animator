Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: sample (U-God)]
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide (Zilla, Zilla)
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide (Zilla, Zilla)

[U-God]
I'm taking all of your divas, I'm eating all of your pizza
Call me Daddy Gunsmoke, throwing long to receivers
Remember fights at the Fever, straight shifting your features
Cuz I'm sharp as a cleaver, spill blood in areas
Cuz I'm rougher then Lazarus, harder then Caesar
Bobber and weaver, straight flow, follow the leader
Mix the coke with the ether, keep snow on the freezer
Stomp gold on my Visa, it's an hour to geezer
Pop holes in your tweeters, your hoe want me to bang her
I'm the one man army with tsunamis of swagger, bragger

[Chorus]

[U-God]
Ready and able, cuz my blows are more fatal
I'm the human tornado, pulling guns out the cradle
It's a scene out Casino, scrape cream off the table
Shape pants enabled, break dancing, gold cables
Prada tags and labels, flood drugs with the draino
Put holes in your braino, then I'm off to Barbados
It's the black Clark Gable, jump out the sable and bang you
Wide turns on the angle, sideburns with the banger
Curtains you up for danger, hurting you with the chamber
Circle you with the flamer, hurting you with the stinger, ringer

[Chorus]

[U-God]
It's a whole 'nother level, yo, I'm hot as a kettle
Yo, I handle my business, boy, I body the devil
Yo, I'm diamond embezzled, plus I Hollywood shuffle
And I'm so rebellious, cuz I polly with Russell
And I got hood muscle, when it's on, I say it's on
I'm real, militant, a don, I'm Genghis Khan
I got the bangles on, I muzzle the nozzle
Cappa taught me The Pillage, I'm a RZA apostle
At the tip of your tonsil, yeah, I'm gripping the magnum
Pure physical fitness, when you Enter the Dragon
Yeah, I'm awesome and handsome, the way I scribble my riddle
Sounds'll rattle your limo, can't handle my dribble, bimbo

[Chorus 1.5X]

So he's unfriendly, there's nothing you can do about it</pre>
