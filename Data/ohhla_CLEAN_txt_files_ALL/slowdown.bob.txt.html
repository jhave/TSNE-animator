[Nas]
Girl, can I get your name and number?
Can I relieve the pain you're under?
Change into comfort, uh, get inside your brain
You never cry a-gain, as long as we remain
Doing the little things you love (you love)
Even if I'm a dangerous thug
All the names I'm call, but it keeps you excited
To creep through and ride with a live rich Don
Who was raised in the projects, can I just watch you?
Yeah, lemme see you break it down, I gotchu
Any town we pop, boo
I +Get Around+ like Digital Underground and 'Pac do

[Bobby Valentino - Chorus]
Slow down, I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around 'cause that pretty round thing
Looks good to me
Slow down, never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around and bless me with, your beauty, cutie

I saw you walking, down on Melrose
You looked like and angel
Straight out of heaven, girl
I was blown away by, your sexiness
All I have to do is catch up to you

[Chorus]
Slow down, I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around 'cause that pretty round thing
Looks good to me
Slow down, never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around and bless me with, your beauty, cutie

A butterfly tattoo, right above your naval
Your belly button's pierced too, just like I like it girl
Come take a walk with me, you'll be impressed by
The game that I kick to you
It's over and for reeeeeaal

Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready
To be watered by this conversation, you're ready
I'm in awe cause you shine like the sun
Let me be the one to enjoy you
Let's kick it girl

[Chorus]
Slow down, I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around 'cause that pretty round thing
Looks good to me
Slow down, never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around and bless me with, your beauty, cutie

[Bridge]
Ooooh baby, you know by now that I want you BAD
I'm floating on thin air I can't come DOWN
Cupid, hit me already DAMN
Now, I can't leave till seven digits are in my hand, MY HAND

[Nas]
Are you tired of the same things? Same drama?
Same guys with the same game? Bad karma?
If I take you away from the man that you wit (uh)
I just wanna borrow you, kiss every part of you
Can you be a fresh girl? Nasty
Do anything I'll request, girl? Then prove it
And you need somebody to talk to
About things, it's Prada, if you want to
Told you Nas'll come through, I bet, c'mon

[Chorus and ad-libs]</pre>
