[Intro]
She looks like a (4x)

[Chorus - repeat 4x] {*ad libs through out*}
She looks like a movie star
Like a chocolate candy bar

[Verse]
(She looks like a)
Heya love love, you little fly lady bug
Come and swing this episode wit more from up above
With them Earl Jeans on fitting tight like a glove
You little Cinammon Toast Crunch, come show me some love!
Slim goodie got tittle litties
Yeah but she's a picture post card pretty fat kitty little bitty, WHOO!!
You're provoking me, giving me the notions
To make me wanna lick your funky emotions
She can make a crippled man walk and a blind man see
How can I put this? hmm
She can make the Grinch love Christmas
How can I manifest her uniqueness in vernacular?
(Like a chocolate candi bar) yeah that describes her

[Chorus]

[Verse]
(She looks like a)
I seen her at the park on the black top watching the kids play
Hey style complimented the sunny day
There's a mild nature about her
Gentle but firm for all the bullshit life brought her way
You reflected beauty of a starless night by far
Like Billy Joel said "I take you just the way you are!"
I had a crush on you since the days of love tap
Karate shoes you had jelly cornrows with the peas in the back
I knew you'd grow to be a fine specimen someday
You the very inspiration for the song I sing
The way you sprint the runway and scale the catwalk
Your life is a movie and the camera's never off
It's like love at first taste, coming deep from within
From your DNA structure to your whole body ova
Your beauty is respected in the eye of the beholder
I love that little chocolate bar tattered on your shoulder

[Chorus]

[Verse]
(She looks like a)
Oh yeah the time is now and the place is here
So come a little closer let me kick it in your ear
And share this wit you girl you super official
I just wanna bite you girl you look good like a Snickers
Ooh la la, ah wee wee, walking by looking all like I exctasy
Got doe ma didn't know, good gracious alive!
Aw shuck now, there she go
Hey yo come and rest your feet my little chocolate soufflet
I know you're tired you been running through my mind all day
And Oh My Goodness! can I get a witness?
This roundy brownie is something to see
I never had a craving like this before, I'm addicted
Lord have mercy! please give me strength!
Dark, rich and thick like a fresh baked cake
Just thinking of your shape girl I catch a tooth ache

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(She looks like a)
We just buggin out a little bit, showing versatility
