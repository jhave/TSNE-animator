[Gucci Mane]
Your boy Gucci Mane speakin
Yeah I'm home, just touched down
I'm addressing all these blow pops out there
YUH!!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
A blow pop, that's a straight up buster
I call 'em blow pops cause they big old suckers

[Gucci Mane]
I'm lookin at the world through my iced out gaze
You couldn't walk a mile in my brand new J's
... If you know what I mean
I keep courtside seats like I play for the team
... I'm killin myself
Hold my dick when I rap cause I'm feelin maself
... Real talk youse a blow pop
Got out of jail, now your whole show stop
... Youse a blow pop homie
I'm independent ballin major, you get no props homie
Six months was a pit stop
And I ain't got time to be fuckin with no blow pops

[Chorus] - 2X

[Gucci Mane]
To hate on Gucci Mane that's a blow pop move
You gotta wear 20's just to fill my shoes
... See I ain't fuckin with blow pops
You let him in ya clique and now you stuck with a blow pop
You thought he was a G, he turned out to a blow pop
You bought his cd, now you know he's a blow pop
... Some blow pops tried to kill me
Somebody set me up so tell me how am I guilty?
But I don't need no one else
Cause any time I get a beep I just call myself
Cause youse

[Chorus] - 2X

[Gucci Mane]
Big Cat Records play rough, what de blood claat?
Gucci on the mic talkin 'bout all these blow pops
... Man they softer than fat back
Hundred fifty grand for the chain can you match that?
... Man you straight up fake
And if I see you in the street probably spit in your face
... The rap game so sleazy
They tried to knock me off but ay it ain't that easy
Them blow pops all wanna blow up
Mad cause my watch cost the same as a Porsche truck
... Got locked tryin to hoe hop
But that's what I get man for fuckin with blow pops

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
