Dear Marcus
I know it's been hard times
Since they made you the victim of this so called crime
Kinda snatched you out the game of life, in your prime
They already took one
We won't let them take nine
Since birth it seems like the deck was stacked against you to fail
With your father not there
Mom's in and out of jail
But you saw through it all and you chose to excel
I can't see why they chose to lock you in a cell
Well I'm prayin' that you're free by the time you get this
Never known a convict with a 3.96
GPA, but in rural GA
Black boys havin' sex with white girls, no way
In any other state? It would have been okay
For two high school teens to have sexual relations
But at age 15, pssssssst, that's molestation
In the great state of Georgia and I really feel for ya
She was only three months away from being sixteen
You a few months away from achievin' your dreams
All American
Played on the football team
Accepted into Vanderbilt, a scholar in the making
And the jury saw fit to acquit you of the raping
After only fifteen minutes of deliberation
What's the state of our nation when the laws ain't in check?
Got you servin' ten years for consentual sex?!
I'm perplexed and ashamed at the games that playin'
Tryin' to keep a young man from his life and education
Not to mention family, you've been with since age ten
Regardless of your race, they loved you and took you in
So let your struggle make you great, don't let it make you hate
Know we won't stop workin' till we free from them gates
Much love and respect, hold your head God bless
From the bottom of my heart
