What's happenin', nigga
B.Geezy, Baby, Mannie Fresh, nigga
Big Tymers, nigga
You know we be stun'n our ass off, ya heard me

(Bling, -ling, -ling)
You know me and my clique stand out
It's bling-a-ling every time we stick our hand out
Eyes can't take it - motherfuckers turn they head around
I gotta laugh 'cause the neck, too, look like a glass house
Man, that ice the motherfucker
Don't forget the whip - twenty-inches and TV's
Navigation system, Dreamcast, all in the Bentley
Everyday of the week I be jumpin' in somethin' different
Bikes, Lexus Trucks - everyday I be switchin'
My big round, Baby, taught me how to lay my stunt down
Come 'round the corner once, leave, switch up, come back around
You know how it go down on a Sunday uptown
Wrist hangin' out the window of the Jag with the top down
Later on that evenin', corner pocket off the chain
But I advise you: don't come around without that thing
'Cause them vultures be out and believe they be jackin'
But they know I'm a made nigga - I still be stuntastic

(Hook - 2x [B.G.])
It's stuntastic
Straight out the plastic
If they got drastic
Big Tymers is off the heezy
It's ballerific
Cash Money gifted
It's very hard to look at them princess cuts 'cause they be glistenin'

[Baby]
I ride top-notch shit, nigga, all the hot shit
On a Sunday I pull out all my drop-top shit
I be stun'n
Step in the club and buy the vault
I know them hoes be lookin' - that's why I play this game raw
It's just in me to be the nigga that I be
Call me Atrice, call me Bryan, Bubble, or B.
You know who I am
You know Cash Money my fam'
Who else could it be with me and Geezy spinnin' that Lam'
Rockin' that ice, poppin' that cham'
Jumpin' out in front a warehouse dressed in Hot Boy wear
Glock on my side - you know we ain't gettin' checked at the door
Get outta line, we leave a nigga brains on the dance floor
Back to the coffee cup and drop the ice
Shake it up
When it come out, it's gon' fuck your eyes up
Like I said last time: I don't need no introduction
I'm the number-one when it come down to the stun'n

(Hook - 2x [B.G.])
It's stuntastic
Straight out the plastic
If they got drastic
Big Tymers is off the heezy
It's ballerific
Cash Money gifted
It's very hard to look at these princess cuts 'cause they be glistenin'

[Mannie Fresh]
Lil' one, I been paid
Two-thousand-ten escalade
Did I tell you how the seats made
Crocodile and mink suede
I touch y'all niggas' arms with candy-coated choppers
I fed these hoes fettuccini while you was feedin' 'em whoppers
I could take the ugliest bitch and turn her into somethin'
And take a whack-ass track and have that bitch bumpin'
Nigga, Liberacci ain't got nothin' on me
I got one diamond, and one ring bigger than your whole future, g
Shorty, you ain't heard the news? I'm ridin' on twenty-twos
I take the groom bride and give that hoe the blues
My neck on another level
My life on another level
Alright, you got a Benz - and, nigga, I'm pushin' the space shuttle
Bitch, please
My bank account Hercules

[B.G.]
It's, zero, zero, zero, comma, zero, (comma), 
stop (stop), freeze (freeze)

[Mannie Fresh]
Whatever you got, lil' daddy, believe me - I been had it
It's just in my life and my nature and my way to be stuntastic

(Hook - 3x [B.G.])
It's stuntastic
Straight out the plastic
If they got drastic
Big Tymers is off the heezy
It's ballerific
Cash Money gifted
It's very hard to look at these princess cuts 'cause they be glistenin'

[B.G.]
Nigga,
We ballerific and stuntastic, ya heard me
Baby, Mannie Fresh, B.Geezy
You dig
Stun'n 'til we can't stunt no motherfuckin' more, nigga
Reppin' 'til we can't rep no motherfuckin' more, nigga
Huntin' 'til we can't hunt no motherfuckin' more, nigga
From Lamborghinis to Bentley's to Ferrari's to Jaguars to Hummers
To whatever you got - we got it and then some
Ya heard me
From princess cuts to baguettes 
to whatever kind of diamonds they got, we got it, nigga
It don't stop, ya heard me
Cash Money, nigga, got the rap game on lock
How you love that
Baby, Mannie Fresh - they got that work, nigga
And I got that pistol under my shirt, nigga
Yeah slip up if you want
You get put sixty feet under the dirt, nigga
CMR-a, Hot Boys, Cash Money</pre>
