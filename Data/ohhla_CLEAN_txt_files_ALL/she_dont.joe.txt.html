[Intro: Joe Budden]
She ain't got a leg to stand on
Don't even trip, taha

[Joe Budden]
I can take you all over the world though, even tell you pack light
The last lie couldn't even get a cab ride
She don't do the blogs but if she did she'd be on mad sites
Ass so mean that I'm always on her bad side
Uhh, now she don't ever stress me 'bout my whereabouts
Never seems concerned with other birds that she may hear about
She mind hers, it's my turn, that shit she barely care about
Look amazing on me, why I'm always tryin to wear her out
She don't ride like you, no she don't taste like that
Not with a waist like that, do I let her go to waste like that?
She a - mix between Kama Sutra, yoga and porno flicks
Funny how her breath get shorter when I give her long dick
Uhh~! And I'm tellin y'all straight up
Might think I imagined shawty even when she not made-up
She kill 'em in Levi's, see why, it ain't even fair
Look good in whatever she wear, how could other women compare?
They can't

[Interlude: Tank]
I done put another in your space
Damned if they do, it's been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sittin on the case
She gon' hate, but she know

[Chorus: Tank]
She don't put it down like you, down-down like you (she know)
Down-down like you (she know) down-down like you (she know)
She don't put it down like you, down-down like you (she know)
Down-down like you (she know) down-down like you (she know)
She don't put it down like you, girl you workin with the killer
Ain't nobody fuckin with ya
She don't put it down like you, down-down like you (she know)
Down-down like you (she know) down-down like you (she know)
She don't put it down like you

[Lil Wayne]
I can see the stars in the daytime
Bitch I miss you like a deadline
And the girl I'm with is just the girl I'm with
I mean it's workin out, so we're stayin fit
But you know love is nothin, ask Stan Smith
But I gotta keep a bad bitch like Brad Pitt
Remember our first kiss? Or our last kiss?
I used to go dummy in that pussy, crash test
You be fuckin that nigga like you was fuckin me?
Heh, fuck that nigga, he can't fuck with me
I'm Tunechi bitch and you know that, and that pussy throw back
At any given night I'll still pop that ass like a Prozac
Girl you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla
And every time we cut I used to +Shredd-er+, Ninja Turtles
And I know you still love me, and I know it's still for me
That's why we still fuckin - cause she don't put it down like you

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Love bein 'round mine, no downtime, still nothin else even matters
Can't even walk slow through that mall cause paparazzi runnin after
Baby girl workin it like a pro, slow it down or move it faster
Whether them lights on or them lights off like I'm sleepin with The Clapper
Said she watchin what she eat, yet that ass keep gettin fatter
How I'm sexin her makin that ex of hers no longer be a factor
Plus in my mind already know, you done turned them all to Casper
Climb with the former rather latter, you already know which one I'd rather
Come on

[Interlude] + [Chorus]</pre>
