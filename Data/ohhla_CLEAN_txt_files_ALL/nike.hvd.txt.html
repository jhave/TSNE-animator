"Ni-Ni-Nike-Nikes"

[Heavy D]
N-N-N-Nikes I'm for 'em, out the store I bought 'em
And on the b-b-basketbll c-court is where I score them
I'm a, Nike bro I sing SOPRANO acapello
Every, tour that I go, oh no, I won't forget 'em
It's a dangerous thing, never leave home without 'em
Trade in my Nikes I won't even think about it
On my beat the Nike's sleeker, the other kicks are weaker
Eddie F pushes the button, the beat comes out the speaker
The boy can do the dancin, he also does romancin
And when I park my Blazer in my Nikes I'll be p-p-prancin

"Niiiiiiii-kes" {*repeat 2X*}

[Heavy D]
Oh what a relief!
They have red ones, yellow ones, black ones too
White on white, green on white, just to name a few
My crew is fully equipped from ah, the tops to bottom
Everything Nike makes, Heavy D &amp; the Boyz got 'em
So hurry up-ah, run to the store, go get a pair
Guaranteed to be the #1 sneaker of the year
If you're buy yourself, get some for your crew
We wear N-Nikes so you should wear N-Nikes too

"The Nike-the Nike-the Nike-the Nike" {*4X*}
"Niiiiiiii-kes" {*repeat 2X*}

[Heavy D]
What else can I say? (Nike)
We didn't do this cause we had to
We did this cause we wanted to
All we wear is Nike, I sleep with Nikes
Ah-aha-ha-ah-ah-ah-Nikes
