(Hook x1)
Gory Days
You might get stabbed in your heart
Gory Days
Get the butcher knife and tear you apart
Gory Days
You better finish what you start
Gory Daaaaaays

When we bludgeon you'll get your brain laced
You're bein hands on erased
We'll punch you in the same place
Til we break our hands on your face
You crack your head first
Whatever I get - you get worse
I got a busted lip
You got stitches in a hospital bed hearse
This ain't a playfight
You'll get beaten in broad daylight
People watchin me kid but I ain't got no stage fright
No cops in sight
You're gettin cracked through the side
And if there's more beef
We'll find you and put bombs under your eyes
The struggle to live - corrupt
Because too many kicks will pummel your ribs
When you're outnumbered by six
And no ones jumpin in to dead it
Wit me and my peeps swingin hatchets and axes
You think they wanna get hit?
All OGs know the code of the street
Mind your own biz, never go to police - that's how it is
I live Scarface scenes
I live Pulp Fiction scenes
Life is one big movie on the screen

Gory Days
You might get stabbed in your heart
Gory Days
Get a machete and tear you apart
Gory Days
You better finish what you start

(I hope you die)


You made my fuckin day sour
I'll still display power while up for 48 hours
The blood still sprayed like showers
Boxes get knocked out
Jab me I'll jab you
What you put out you get back
It might be worse - we'll blast you
Cops are searchin for me for crimes I committed last year
But haven't caught me yet so I'll drop it in rhymes
I know you want me dead
Put stitches in your forehead
Look kid I want you more dead
Hope you bled in your bed
Fifteen hours in the hospital
Waiting for a doctor to sew you up and a possible operation
You press charges you're less than a carcass
In the streets - no respect
You'll get tricked and stuffed in a coat regardless
Don't judge a book by a cover
Cause a cat could be a crook undercover
And snap and jux up your blubber
From happiness to anarchist
From pacifist to blasphemous
Kid that's how fast it flips
