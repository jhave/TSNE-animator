[Ice-T]
Godfather's in the house..
Grab yo' bitches

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 4X)

Take a look at me, everything I own's iced out
Pimp baby, you can see my wrists with the lights out
This is how I do it, mad bitches and clothes
Godfather baby, only play to my rogues
Step back, hater make a little room for my hoes
Gators on my feet, take a look at my toes
Money is the reason all the real players know that
Godfather lays punks to rest
He got no chance up against the best
I rocks in the East and I rolls in the West
If you don't dig the pimpin I could really care less
cause it's, pimp or die, pimp or die baby

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy..

G-O-D, F-A-T-H-E-R
Hoes start runnin when they see my car
Even though I'ma pro wrestling star
they know I, don't play and I gotta get paid
Everything I wear baby's tailor made
I come into your town and go off like a grenade
And anyone who steps on the mat they get laid
Let me pimp or let me die that's the game I chose
Condos, speedboats, and beautiful hoes
Cartier wristwear, furs and gold
And mad cash baby too much to fold
cause it's, pimp or die, pimp or die baby

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
GRAB YO BITCHES!

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
BIG PIMPIN JUMPIN OFF!

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
GODFATHER's IN THE HOUSE, BITCH!

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy..
Break yourself bitch!

..

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't - pimp or die baby

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
GRAB YO BITCHES!

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
BIG PIMPIN JUMPIN OFF!

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 5X)
GRAB YO BITCHES!</pre>
