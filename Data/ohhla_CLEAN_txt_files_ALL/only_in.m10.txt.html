[Ice Cube]
Speak on it my nigga, speak on it (and my heat go)

Chorus:

Only in California
Where niggaz pull heat and run up on ya (get your grind on)
Only in California (California)
Where niggaz pull heat and run up ya (run up on ya)

Ice Cube the mutherfuckin don
Snoop Doggy Dogg a.k.a. Tha Doggfather
Mack 10 alias the Chicken Hawk
Gangstas with rules
Cause youse the niggaz with no rules
ain't got nothing to lose, we got everything to lose

Threw his ass in, he feel the fin of the baracuda
I negotiate Mack is the shooter
You the nigga on the journey strapped to this gurney
We break breads with accountants and attorneys
Currency never worry me (never)
Who's got the balls to murder me
Degree higher than a 33
Tell em what you drank (Hennessy)
Never tell em what you thinkin
Never tell em where the body stankin
Fuck Lincoln, fuck Jackson, bankin Franklin what you thankin
Hope your man come with the ransom
Let me see you dance on, no longer handsome
If you don't drop off than walk off, watch him, watch him

Chorus

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Them westcoast niggaz is real set trippas (Westside)                     
Will get you for them zippas, on a quest for them chippas (Eastside)
Slidin while we ridin, not even hittin switches
Hangin at the high school gettin at them young bitches (what)
I got the dove sacks, homies love that (who got the bud)
where the bud at, hollering at my big homeboy who fresh out
Hangin at my grandmama house, homie burnt out
What you gonna do when you get out of jail (speak on it)
I'm gonna have some fun (Doggy Dogg)
What do you consider fun a ounce and about five hun
So I put him on a move that I know about
Hooked him with a homegirl from the South (good lookin out)
Money made, plug a playa in the game
Especially when he represent the same thing I claim
Damn they don't make niggaz like they used to
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce deuce (that's real)
Cause everybody wanna be a star
in the city of dope, a.k.a. caviar

Chorus

[Mack 10]
What have we a house full of cavi (no stress)
Well known ridas from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes lickin up so hard we stickin up niggaz
Tired of the bullshit so we clique'n up (Westside)
Nigga please we ain't trippin off C's and B's
It's the Westside Connect with the DPG's
For the cheese we jab with the gift of the gab
always clappin (yeah), Mack, Cube and Snoop rappin
Now how did that happen it's all good (fool)
So peep game If you could
Snoop be from Long Beach and I be from Inglewood (yeah)    
Now you despise cause it came to yo surprise (what)              
Two well known enemies now becoming allies (damn)
In Californ-I-A we parlay the G way
Some wear red and black and some sport blue and grey
So gangsta's don't dance we hang boogie and bang
So it's the Westside Connect with the Dogg Pound Gang

Chorus

[Ice Cube]
There we have it, Ice motherfuckin Cube
The big fish, rollin with the atomic dog
Snoop Doggy Dogg, down with the ring leader
Mack motherfuckin 10, coming back once again
Nigga we make and spend nigga

and my heat goes boom boom boom boom boom boom</pre>
