Yeah, uh uh

Yeah kid, Harlem on the rise
Yeah, turn me up a little bit more
Uh-huh, uh-huh
We like it
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah kid, Harlem on the rise
This the remix '98
And you don't want no problem with us guys
Let's go

Chorus: Puffy, (Mase), [Carl Thomas]

I been around (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I been around the world (Uh-huh, uh-huh) [I been around]
I been around (Uh-huh, uh-huh) [Been around]
I been around the world (Uh-huh, uh-huh) [Ai-yeah]
I been around (Uh-huh, uh-huh) [Aiii, yeah-yeah-yeah]
We ain't gon' stop
I been around the world (Uh-huh, uh-huh) [Whoaou]
I been around
We don't even know how to stop
I been around the world

Verse One: Mase

Yo, yo
Now trick what? Lace who?
That ain't what Mase do
Got a lotta girls that'll love to replace you
Tell it to your face boo, not behind your back
Cats talk slick, we never mind that
Funny never find that Puff a dimestack
Write hot stuff that make people say 'Rewind that'
People know, you go against the Harlem Jiggalo
Getcha hoe, lick her low, make your girl trick your dough
I represent honies with money, fly guys, and jets
Ride with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay, so I look both ways
Cop says okay, my tint smoke gray
No way, people leave without handin' me my chips
Got plans to get my land and my 6
People outta town'll understand these hits
Pop champagne like I won a championship

Chorus: Puffy, [Carl Thomas]

I been around [Been around]
I been around the world [I been around]
I been around [Been around]
I been around the world [Ai-yeah]
I been around [Aiii, yeah-yeah-yeah]
I been around the world
Can't stop the power
I been around [Whoaou]
I been around the world

Verse Two: Puff Daddy

Yea-yea, yeah, yeah
I was in one bedroom, dreamin of a million
Now my beach houses creamed to the ceiling
I was a gentleman livin in tenements
Now I'm swimmin' in all the women every tens
Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men
Now my dividends be the new Benjamins
Chicks of all complexions, I like cinnamon
Mase you got some girls, well playboy
Send 'em in
What you waitin' for let the freakshow begin
How they came in a truck (Mase: Nah Puff, that's a Benz)
Mercedes, come here baby
You don't like the way it's hot and hazy
Never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous how they keep their lips on this
Don't kiss right there, girlfriend I'm ticklish
And I be switchin fees with a wrist full of G's
Playa please, I'm the macaroni with the cheese

Chorus: Puffy, [Carl Thomas]

I been around
Yea-yea, yeah, yeah
I been around the world [I been around]
I been around [Been around]
I been around the world [Ai-yeah]
I been around [Aiii, yeah-yeah-yeah]
I been around the world
Can't stop the power
I been around [Whoaou]
I been around the world

Verse Three: Mase, Puff Daddy

What, what
You don't know who the hell I be
Can tell I be
Now hasta la vista, c'est la vie
Now what have we a cat in a Bentley waggy
That keep cats saggy, roll with P-Daddy
Some be wanna bag me, girls be one to stab me
I be more than gladly to tell a foe
Yo, you ain't offendin' me
It ain't like you the third son of the Kennedy
Or even in a mob where you can send for me
But all until you talk you don't ever spend a G
I know how it be
You know me from before when I used to detour
Down in B-more, push the E or 
Days I just kick it
My crew buys Crystal just so we can spit it
All that expensive stuff just so that we can shit it
Be a lot of places that you niggaz can't visit
Talking cause I live it

repeat Chorus

Outro: (Heard in background)

The remix
9-8, B.I.G. forever
Can't stop and we won't stop
We don't even know how to stop
Let's go, Big ???, Big Carl
Harlem on the rise
and you don't want no problem with us guys
L-O-X, Little Justin
I see Quincy
Ha ha ha, ahh, 9-8 we got a game
We gon keep puttin it on your ass
And we won't stop, we don't even know how to stop
