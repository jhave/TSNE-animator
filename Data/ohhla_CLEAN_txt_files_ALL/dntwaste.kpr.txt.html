[Chief Kamachi]
Yo, before I bear the cross
My lungs trying to see a dutch
I smile at the heavens, I now know that we in touch
Mic Messiah, please acknowledge me as such
I work miracles when famine and hunger struck
Heal the world, dreaded JuJu girl in a jungle hut
Peasants scrambling on the bottom trying to stumble up
In line for blessings, stressing wit they number tucked
About my image as a child they used to wonder much
Fist thru the clouds, index finger wit the thunder touch
Alpha-Omega all nine numbers clutched
144 waiting, like will he come or what?
Deathlehem, Kabala, camouflage hummer truck
Hebrew king sing the song of the Lord
Lyrical Nibiru, humans welcome aboard
Thru the pineal gland, my warrior clan is absorbed
Sit on the sands, no telescope, study a orb
Real rulers rule they stars, watch the transits
Young tut back, you see the precious stones and amulets
Still in search of OZ, this a different zone from Kansas
I bewilder the minds of the scandalous, analyst
God-body debate any panelist, about they racial claims
I take as strange
Last cycle warned 'em fate would change
My-rec-room-reign, hi-top-kane, two dancers
Gold-plate chains, all my shell top souls take aim
Quiet storm, philosophical firearm
Study my glow, never attempt to try the charm
Magic shows on the strips of Giza
The Valley of the Kings was just a teaser
I am the host, from Philly to Abydos, keeping my album
Like keeping the magic close
'Don't Waste Your Lungs'!!
