What's better than trippin' is fallin' in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon, and all the above?
What's better than poppin' bottles tryin' to ball in the club
is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club
What's better than paper is ballin' it up
What's better than followers is actually fallin' in love
What's better than frolickin', follies, fallin' in mud?
Rollin' in green pastures, wanderin', followin' love
What's better than eatin' is feedin' your fam
What's better than meetings is missin' meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leanin' and needin' a Xan
is hittin' your zan dreamin' a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yellin' is hollerin' love
What's better than rhymes, nickels, dimes and dollars and dubs
is dialin' up your darling just for callin' her up
It ain't nothin' better than fallin' in love - IGH!

I've seen it come back, back, back and forth
You hit the nail right on top of the head
I know you've seen it all before
But when it looks you in the eyes, it ain't nothin' you could say but 
That's love, that's love
That's love, that's love
Say that's love, ooh-ooh, that's lo-o-ove
That's love.. that's love, that's love, that's love
I LOVE you! (Love you) I LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)
I LOVE you! (Love you) I LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)
I LOVE you! (Love you) I LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)
I LOVE you! (Love you) I LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)
I LOVE you! That's love
That's loooo-o-o-ove, that's love
Say that's love, ooh-ooh, that's love
That's love.. that's love, that's love, that's love</pre>
