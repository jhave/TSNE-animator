[Jadakiss]
Uhh.. uh, uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh (uh) uh (uh) uh-uh-uh
Uh (uh) uh (uh) uh-uh-uh
Uh (uh) uh (uh) uh-uh-uh
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Hey yo I got land cars and jewelry, and artillery
And I got every hood feelin me
It's nuttin like when a thug get at you and spit thug literature
Your fanbase wanna get rid of you
Still in the hood doin it
I don't know why I'm doin this, we don't eve move a lot of units
But ain't no threats, don't stress me dog
You gotta let me hear somethin to impress me dog
When I spit I put rappers in line, then smack 'em around 
I got 'em all home practicin now
You know 'Kiss be, icey hard and crispy
The truck's manual but the Coupe is 6-B
Listen I ain't never spit nonsense
I'm from the street with a mean vocabulary contents
Whoever you send I'll send back
Y'all all been wack; 'Kiss is makin a strong impact
C'mon

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
(When 'Kiss, is spittin) They don't love you no more
(When 'Kiss, is spittin) Things will never be the same a-gain
(When 'Kiss, is spittin) Why they hatin on you
[Jada] It's just like that, ha! (When 'Kiss, is spittin)

[Jadakiss]
Uh, uh, yo, yo
Sinnin or not, I'm grinnin a lot, spendin a knot
Dirty denim and a cinnamon fox
Bitches'll follow, gangsters'll ride, gentlemen watch
Buy the bar, leave drunk, shoot up the block
You might hear 'Kiss spittin, but after the show
you might hear clips spittin, we after your glow
Things'll never be the same again
when your frame get bent, link get worn, change get spent
Confiscate your whip - you think you a player?
I could confiscate your bitch, take her and slay her
If a nigga nicer than me, then Christ is here
You got somethin in the bank? Then the dice is here
I could show you how to gamble your money, handle a gun
but be a family man and go home to your son
Light a candle where you stand, cause that's where you died
and if you heard 'Kiss spittin, then you know it was won, uh

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Yo, yo
Hey yo the voice got a lot of people heated, peep it
The flow is like methadone - lot of people need it
Seen it all happen before
Feel like I'm still hustlin; cause the way I'm rappin is raw
You could put your jewels on it
You might just see me in the lightning pickup with the 22's on it
The stakes'll cost you; understand one thing
I do great field work plus I'ma boss too
Loyalty is hard to come by
Y'all know who the streets is run by, could only be one guy
And that be who but 'Kiss, no security
The burner and some niggaz that I grew up with
And the brand new 911, fuck a dime
with a fine eleven at stop signs I'm revvin
And the flow is just so obnoxious
As far as the Double R camp go, dawg I got this, c'mon now

[Chorus] w/o Jada {*repeat 2X*}</pre>
