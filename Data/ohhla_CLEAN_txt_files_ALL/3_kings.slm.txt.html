[Lil Jon voice sample throughout]
"Oh!-Oh!-Oh!-Kaaaayyyyyy"

[Slim Thug]
Slim Thugga! Bun B, T.I.P. baby!
Boss Hogg, Dirty South!

[Chorus 2X: Slim Thug]
When I hit the club all the girls show me love
Buying out the the bar, got drank by the jug
In the V.I.P. with the chicks and the drugs
This is T-I-P, Bun B and Slim Thug

[Slim Thug]
I got drank by the pint, dro by the pound
Headed to the club and Tha Boss top down
Slim Thug bout the grind, represent H-Town
If you love me you gon smile, if you hate me you gon frown
Cause me and my Boss Hoggs bout to ball till we fall this year
I won't stall, Slim Thugga want it all
Going solo! first CD out that's not slow mo'
Here's another hit thanks to dranking the do-do
Fa sho though, we got the club shut down
Tryna pick which chick I'm a cut now
Got a fetish for thick girls that's caramel brown
On a hunt and up, guess what I just found
Come in VIP with me boo, while we post up
We blowin purple stuff, we pouring purple stuff
We glowing from wrist up, you can tell that we rich
It's Slim Thugga, T-I-P and Bun B bitch!

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
22's on a brand new coupe wit no roof
Hundred fifty doller tennis shoes, no suits
We some ballers pimp, you oughta be followin our suits
No ad-libbing nigga just do like I do
Don't get it confused, cause dude I'm not you
If you ain't heard the news I'm known as the truth
That's why I'm at the bar buying all this Grey Goose
Passing it to them broads, cause mayne is they loose
That's why nigga Slim Thug, they man what they do
Say the black one a slut, but the red would cut too
Give em numbers to the suites and tell em to fall through
And tell that nigga E.S.G. and Paul Wall too (ohh!)
I know Bun B had been fun wit them freaks (yeah!- yeaaaaah!)
Do it like a G for Screw and Pimp c
From the A but I got all of Houston with me
At the superbowl pulling groups of hoes six deep nigga!

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
We going hard in the paint like Carmello (Carmello)
This is for the boys who sip purple and sip yellow (yellow)
Shorty shake ya jelly like J.Lo, she curvy like a jello
Damn baby put me up before I even said hello
Is it the car? is it the ice? is it the grill? (is it the grill)
Cause I'm a star that paid the price to keep it trill (keep it trill)
She at the bar, she lookin nice, she on da pill
And she got two more wit her ready, so tell me how you feel (hold up)
See pimpin ain't made, nigga pimpin ain't raised
Nigga pimpin is born, pimpin since its early days
These niggaz get to trippin playa pimpin ain't lazy
And if ya miss Pimp C throw up ya dueces and ya tres (mayne)
We thought of many ways and perfected the grind (grind)
Making million dollas moves, six figga checks we can sign (signed)
Slim Thugga you up next to shine, and I can't even lie
Wit me and T-I-P man you done wrecked 'em this time foo! (time foo)
