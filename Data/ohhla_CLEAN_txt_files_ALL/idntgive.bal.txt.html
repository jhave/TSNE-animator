Intro: (Bali)
Hey man it's your boy Bali
Ay I'm feelin my motherfuckin self nigga
Words can't break me nigga
The hate don't make me nigga
(I don't give a fuck)
Yeah
(I don't give a fuck)
Hey Duck, hey Ace let's put it on they ass my nigga
(Nigga I don't give a fuck)
(Bitch I don't give a fuck)

Betta recognize a real nigga when you see one
Look at my clique four niggas you don't see none
Had a job, fuck a job, nigga can't keep one
Headed back to the streets where a nigga is from
Pockets bulging, pistol totin, cocked and loaded
But you won't notice, cuz I'm a low key nigga
So I walk lightly, getting bucks so fuck any nigga who don't like me
No trust for a bitch, yeah they so trifling
I'm hardcore for dem hoes, yeah I'm so Icy
Bali Boy and Papa Duck, four pills to the mug
Me and Ace getting cake think I give a mother fuck about

Chorus:
All that hate, and all that envy
Don't make or break me
Yeah it really don't offend me
Them young niggas silent, 
Words can't bend me
Fuck what ya heard these words for the enemy
The enemy: (I don't give a fuck) bout none of y'all
(I don't give a fuck) bout none of y'all
(Nigga I don't give a fuck) bout none of y'all
(Bitch I don't give a fuck)

Papa Duck:
(You a rude ass nigga)
My nigga you blind
I ain't with ya nigga not I
You a real nigga, shit I don't see how
You gon' make a nigga ban your ass
You don't see all these Haitian flags?
Hey Bali, slap that nigga in the mouth 
with that fire so his ass can stop hollerin
From Belle Glade all the way up Fort Pierce
Head first in the streets is how a nigga live
Papa Duck on the block getting hunduns
(who taught ya how to get money?) nigga Jon Jon
Ay Bali they mad cuz we got funds, 
At least we know that it's comin from
 
Chorus (with Ace Hood in background):
All that hate, and all that envy
Don't make or break me
Yeah it really don't offend me
Them young niggas silent, 
Words can't bend me
(Bali I got ya homie)
Fuck what ya heard these words for the enemy
(Straight up nigga)
The enemy: (I don't give a fuck) bout none of y'all
(We don't give a fuck about these niggas out here homie)
(I don't give a fuck) bout none of y'all
(Too much money I can't see y'all niggas homie)
(Nigga I don't give a fuck) bout none of y'all
(Bitch I don't give a fuck)

Ace Hood:
(I don't give a fuck)
Ace Hood
Ay I don't give a fuck
I never gave a damn
If money ain't involved I ain't tryin to understand
Understand hundred grand in my pants I swag
When I pull up in that jag, peanut butter soft rag
Tell them niggas I'm back
With that duffle on the dash and that pistol in the stash
Make a nigga bite, down, AK-47, rounds
Make a nigga lay, down, tell that fool what, now
Yeah it's bout to go, down, 
Young gutta motherfucker tell them others bout me
When you see me in the streets fake niggas don't speak
Imma treat ya like T.I.P. homie you don't know me
Me and Bali blowin green and we stuck to the cream so quit

Chorus:
All that hate, and all that envy
Don't make or break me
Yeah it really don't offend me
Them young niggas silent, 
Words can't bend me
Fuck what ya heard these words for the enemy
The enemy: (I don't give a fuck) bout none of y'all
(I don't give a fuck) bout none of y'all
(Nigga I don't give a fuck) bout none of y'all
(Bitch I don't give a fuck)</pre>
