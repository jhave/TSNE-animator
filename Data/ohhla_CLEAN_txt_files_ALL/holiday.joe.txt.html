Chorus (Emanny)
Everydays the same to me 
Seven days in every week
Some look forward to it 
But I don't change as for the holiday's

You can have your Christmas tree (Hello)
Go get drunk on New Years eve 
Some look forward to it (Can anybody hear me)
But I don't change cause every day's a holiday 

Hey, Cause every days a holiday

Hey, Cause every days a holiday

[Joe Budden]
Mic check 1212
Mic check 1212
If ain't tell me tomorrow was my birthday I would never know 
Understand I'm kinda bad with dates 
I don't need a party but a nigga need cake  
Cause I got to much on my plate to celebrate 
Whole family unemployed 
So incomes now a void
Footin everybody's bills 
So naturally I'm annoyed 
It's like the year kinda flew by 
And like a fool I sat back and scrutinized 
I'm high beaming on a dark road 
All my goals now ashes on charcoal
I spark stogs 
Disregard car's 
Just cause my hearts cold
I'm carrying cargo
No offense 
Don't need a phone call or a presents 
I mean honestly I don't want none of ya'll present 
Cause I won't pretend like my everyday struggles went away
so I'mma treat this like any normal day 

[Chorus]
Everydays the same to me 
Seven days in every week
Some look forward to it 
But I don't change as for the holiday's

You can have your Christmas tree (Hello)
Go get drunk on New Years eve 
Some look forward to it (Can anybody hear me)
But I don't change cause every day's a holiday

[Verse two]
If they ain't tell me tomorrow was Halloween I'd never known
I've never been the type to keep up with dates so while ah 
Everybody is putting there mask on 
Nigga I rock mine all year 
Just to avoid stares
To come across like a nigga who cares 
So to my peers I can look like I'm really sincere
Yeah 
Everything's not what it appear
I fear being rare my costume aware 
I swear I won't take it off like near
It's weird 
Even when I take it off shits near
To some my outfit is sheer
So I despise their jeers cause they know I see them all as mirror
Don't love ya'll enough to let you see me bare 
Let you see how he's impaired 
Naw I'm not there
We tend to run from anything weird 
At least on holloween ya'll would stay right there 
Yeah 

[Chorus]
Everydays the same to me 
Seven days in every week
Some look forward to it 
But I don't change as for the holiday's

You can have your Christmas tree 
Go get drunk on New Years eve 
Some look forward to it 
But I don't change cause every day's a holiday

[Verse three]
If I didn't read it was Christmas I'd never known 
Maybe I'm wrong I don't give a fuck about dates 
So while everybody's unwrapping gifts 
I'm trying to capitalize of mine 
Just to get some shine 
Outta recline while I'm still in my prime 
To many time when the date came I ain't have a dime 
So I look at my friends with envy 
 For some reason them getting gifts would offend me 
Like there home was perfect 
Mine felt empty 
They say that it's the thought that counts 
I had plenty 
Like why 
On thanksgiving my family would never visit 
And even when they did it always seemed so scripted 
Like they was forced to 
Like small talk would resolve the 364 days they ain't call you 
I should act like ya'll somebody I'm close to 
Holidays don't make me socials 
I have to be vocal 

[Chorus]
Everydays the same to me 
Seven days in every week
Some look forward to it 
But I don't change as for the holiday's

You can have your Christmas tree 
Go get drunk on New Years eve 
Some look forward to it 
But I don't change cause every day's a holiday</pre>
