[Intro: Latif]
Paper touchin! I don't know if your money right but a nigga like me got paper

[Chorus: Latif] (Red Cafe)
I don't know if your money right but a nigga like me got paper (HUH!)
I don't know what your money like but a nigga like me 'bout paper (Red Cafe!)
I'm 'bout paper, I'm 'bout paper (That's all!)
All my niggas gettin paper
We got paper, we got paper (You know I'm cooler than the other side of the pillow)
All my hustlers got paper

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Listen up hustlers, I treat them bricks
Like the Wheel of Fortune spin it, that's why I'm rich (DAMN!)
Sick, I should have been in Saw IV
But I'm numero uno trick draw four
HEY! I wave at the haters
They know it's me I be wearin all the lasers
Shakedown, we paper touch
Ever since I came home and escaped the cuffs
Cafe, servin the East to the West! (WHAT ELSE!)
I got 'em on E like Ryan Seacrest (WHAT ELSE!)
The Wire said keep the devil in the hole (THAT'S ALL!)
But I'm the chef my kettle is never cold
It's whatever for the dough, whatever on the 'flo
Like I'm from 'Frisco just tell me when to go
(WALLA!) Memorial Day in M-I-A!
I made it Hurricane Chris, Ay Bay Bay

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
From PR to DR, niggas know who we are
They know how we do it it's the motherfuckin Unit
Push the rock move the yayostack paper like Leggos
Rap tornado yeah we fuck with Tego
He don't even speak spanish he a fraud
Joe really don't want drama he a broad see that cannon oh lord
That nigga get to talkin to God
Like father forgive me for my sins and forgive me for my friends
If you give me one more chance I will not do this again
Why 50 never lose man he always wins
It's cause the block love us, you, cocksucker
I, got your number, this could be your last summer
Pussy nigga come around me, movin
I'll put a hollow through him (Hollow through him)
I'll leave your body, oozin
I don't know who confused him (Who confused him?!) 50!

[Chorus: Latif] (Red Cafe)
I don't know if your money right but a nigga like me got paper
I don't know what your money like but a nigga like me 'bout paper
I'm 'bout paper, I'm 'bout paper (WHAT ELSE!!!) All my niggas gettin paper
We got paper, we got paper (THAT'S ALL!!!) All my hustlers got paper

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
HA-HAH!!!! Yeah..
Yo, if it look like a good write-off, I'm chargin it (uh-huh)
The Gucci napsack got a couple large in it (yep)
The CD player got El Debarge in it (hah)
Laid back, while your girl's massagin it (woo!)
I keep my loot saved, sell mad crack
Other than that, stay in the crib and watch bootlegs (yep)
Polo robe on, Louis Vuitton cleathers
Thick R&amp;B chick, gettin my Hov on (OH!!)
Soon as we unwrap 'em, cuttin the stove on
Cook 'em, cut 'em, and bag 'em then I'm gettin my O's on
I don't pay attention to internet bloggers (nah)
I really get it in, wit the murderers and robbers (yea)
This is what a goon'll do
Treat your gravesite like a urinal then YouTube your funeral (hahaha)
It's just Jada (yea), and I might see you in hell
much later, but right now I'ma touch paper

[Verse 4: Fabolous]
Baby, I touch paper, so much paper
We can split it down the middle like Dutch paper
And fo' real, I don't even call it paper
I got money out the ass, so it's toilet paper
Shorty good money in the back area (Woo!)
Curve on her hip make me wanna Blackberry her
And everybody talkin duffle bag shit
Only paper in is prol'ly what they stuff the bag with (fo' real)
My swag fit like it's tailor-made yo
New York love me, I got a tailor-made flow
Oh naw, I ain't who to go hard wit
My young boy'll do the job like the Omar hit, sheeiiiiiiittttttttt!

[Chorus: Latif] (Red Cafe)
I don't know if your money right but a nigga like me got paper
I don't know what your money like but a nigga like me 'bout paper
I'm 'bout paper, I'm 'bout paper (WHAT ELSE!!!) All my niggas gettin paper
We got paper, we got paper (THAT'S ALL!!!) All my hustlers got paper

[Outro: Akon]
Konvict!!!!!</pre>
