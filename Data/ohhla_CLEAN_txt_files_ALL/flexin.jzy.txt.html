[Chorus]
Flexin, Flexin everyday I'm flexin
..Flexin was crime you gon' have to come arrest me
They asked me what I'm doin, that's a good question
Let you niggas know ..soon as I get done flexin
Flexin, flexin, all day I'm flexin
..Flexin was crime then somebody come arrest me
They asked me what I'm doin, that's a good question
Let you niggas know soon as I get done flexin

[Young Jeezy - Verse 1]
Young you stay killin em, bitch I gotta hit list
On that murder 1 kush, bitch you gotta hit this
Jizzle in that 5.9.9. you can't forget this
Don't make me hop up out this pretty bitch &amp; take a twitpic
Foreign bitch with me, yeah she take a big dick
Foreign M60, yeah it take a big clip
We understand the top, damn nigga where yo doors go
Bitch I'm on the moon what the fuck I need some doors fo
Shooters right behind me, yeah they in a escalade
You know how to find me, shooters in the escalade
Killers on payroll, bitch even my neck work
Left the house with all my chains on, look like my neck hurt

[Chorus]
Flexin, Flexin everyday I'm flexin
..Flexin was crime they gon' have to come arrest me
They asked me what I'm doin, that's a good question
Let you niggas know ..soon as I get done flexin
Flexin, flexin, all day I'm flexin
..Flexin was crime then somebody come arrest me
They asked me what I'm doin, that's a good question
Let you niggas know soon as I get done flexin

[Fabolous - Verse 2]
I'm Flexin, Flexin, ain't moving a muscle though
Come through in some foerign shit, you checking it like customs hoe
American gangster chase them franks like Russell Crowe
Them benjamin franks in-case you lost or just don't know
I got my bet on, that's my black watch
&amp; all I do is win my pockets look like jackpots

Check my calendar it say I'm flexin all summer
So your lucky day is when you get a call from us
We in &amp; out them stores, they think we the mall runners
I never change, that's why I carry all hundreds
I'm doing me &amp; yo bitch is who I'm next to do
Other than the schedule is flexible (niceee)

[Chorus]
Flexin, Flexin everyday I'm flexin
..Flexin was crime they gon' have to come arrest me
They asked me what I'm doin, that's a good question
Let you niggas know ..soon as I get done flexin
Flexin, flexin, all day I'm flexin
..Flexin was crime then somebody come arrest me
They asked me what I'm doin, that's a good question
Let you niggas know soon as I get done flexin

[Yo Gotti - Verse 3]
I'm Flexin, (Flexinnnnnnn) lookin like a million bucks
Double story white house, that bitch a million plus
Look at my garage everything I ride a 100 up
If I ain't the gangster of the year, I'm runner up
Flexin, flexin aston martin textin
911 porshe, quadruple doors, that bitch sexy
Straight cash shawty, motherfuck a credit card
See me in the club, lookin like a fed charge
Brick talk, dope boy shit, making money fly
Spot light, center of attention, I ain't gotta try
Flexin, presidential rollie with the ice in it
Closet full of gucci shoes cost more than ya breitlin
I'M FLEXIN

[Chorus x3]
Flexin, Flexin everyday I'm flexin
..Flexin was crime they gon' have to come arrest me
They asked me what I'm doin, that's a good question
Let you niggas know ..soon as I get done flexin
Flexin, flexin, all day I'm flexin
..Flexin was crime then somebody come arrest me
They asked me what I'm doin, that's a good question
Let you niggas know soon as I get done flexin</pre>
