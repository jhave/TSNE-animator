What that Mafia like nigga

[PIMP D]
Here I go again with that motherfuckin' take off
It's YG Pimp D with the motherfuckin' sawed off
Bitches get hauled off if they wanna swang
I'm bickin' back being bool with the Mafia Lanes
Back in the house
Flossin' on them D's
Front back, side to side
B-I-tch please
Fuck the *Lucky Charms*, hit the 187
And we sendin' all Crab niggas to hell in
So peep this shit that I flow to you
I stomp out the *Rice Crispies*, now what you wanna do?    *RAYMOND AVE CRIP*
Not a motherfuckin' thing 
Bitches all on my nuts
YG Pimp D I gives a mad-ass fuck

[B-BRAZY &amp; PIMP D]
YG Pimp D don't give a mad-ass fuck
Since I don't give a fuck, then we don't give a fuck...

[PIMP D]
Back on up, you know that shit ain't over
I'm pickin' these niggas like a four leaf clover
187 and I'm peelin' Rickets cap
I'm settin' up shop and that's a motherfuckin' fact
Nigga step to me and they get their ass shot
By this young gangsta mack in a parking lot
Now who can follow me, nigga on the C-K
'fore I can put a dime on these tiny Crabs man
It ain't no stoppin' this shit when I'm on the let loose
I'm goin' brazy, it ain't a damn thing you can do

[B-BRAZY &amp; PIMP D]
YG Pimp D don't give a mad-ass fuck
Since I don't give a fuck, then we don't give a fuck...

[PIMP D]
I'm 'bout to close shop nigga
That's the last verse
Let's put this punk niggas in the motherfuckin' hearse
Now I got a Gauge punk niggas run up
And I put on their ass on the motherfuckin' stomp
It ain't no stoppin' this shit when the West Side ride
Niggas fuck and slippin' and be a victim of the homicide
You don't even know what I'm thikin' about
See 187, dicks and nuts in your mouth

[B-BRAZY &amp; PIMP D]
YG Pimp D don't give a mad-ass fuck
Since I don't give a fuck, then we don't give a fuck...

[PIMP D &amp; B-BRAZY]
It's the YG Pimp D - and the Braze a Daze
Back on your ass with the motherfuckin' K
Niggas step through us if you think then can get some'
I put niggas on they back then I gots to run
Back to the tilt, gets some more shells, givin' Crabs hell, this the D.L.
Killer OG's like EVIL, AL and TONE
HOOD, ????, BAM, KROW
Even fool the don't know put me on map
So I stay strap, bustin' on a muthafuckin' cap
I have to shake the spot with the pocket full of rocks
It's the B-funk nigga, you know that's what we like
Crab niggas don't even wanna scrap with me
I'm peelin' Ricket caps back to the fat G
Now what you wanna do?
I don't even know, YG Pimp D I thought I told ya so

[B-BRAZY &amp; PIMP D]
YG Pimp D don't give a mad-ass fuck
Since I don't give a fuck, then we don't give a fuck...</pre>
