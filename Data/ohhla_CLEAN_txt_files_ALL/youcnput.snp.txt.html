[Intro: Snoop]
Yo Devin, what up god?
It's the big Mac, yeah
I got this new shit right here man
You might wanna hit this
Trip, mmm

[Chorus 2X: Snoop Dogg]
You can put it in a zag, I'ma put it in a blunt
You can sit in the back, I'ma sit in the front
No stunt, no punk
It really don't matter cause I got what they want

[Snoop Dogg]
They say all day we play and blow
See this is the only thing we know
I blow kush again, on the push again
With a bad lil' cute lil' Mexican

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, zig-zag how I roll mine
You could tell I be a G how I hold mine
I ain't into loanin shit, I'ma own mine
Bitch fuck with me, stumble on a gold mine

[Snoop Dogg]
Break bread or fake dead, punk bitch this is real life
Executive branch, what it feel like?
Catch me if you can, I'm your local kush man
Sittin in the stands with a hundred grams in my hand

[Wiz Khalifa]
And I blow, so much smoke
Pure OG, hit it once might choke
See I'ma go kick it with a BEITCH I could poke
And you could ride too, high school, take a toke

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, no stems, no seeds
Mac gave me all the class that a nigga need
Just taught my old bitch how to roll weed
And the nigga ridin with me gettin high with me

[Snoop Dogg]
Square as a reverend to my young nigga Devin
Got to hangin out with Mac and now we 24/7
On the go smokin 'dro, deep on the Westside
Bangin where his hood at; yup, you got to love that

[Wiz Khalifa]
Yup, I love that - niggaz used to offer but I wouldn't
Now I'm all askin "Where the bud at?"
Makin it happen, me and Mac just got two bitches crackin
that say they tryin to smoke weed all night and down for gettin tatted

[Snoop Dogg]
Spatted up and tatted up, suited up and booted up
Pioneers baby, ain't nuttin that you can do to us
Inhale, that's the high school
Dev and Mac, we known to act a damn fool
You dig?

[Outro: Snoop]
You know what?
It may sound crazy but uh, yeah
Dev and Mac, high school...
It may sound crazy but uh... {*3X*}</pre>
