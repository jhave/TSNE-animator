[Intro]
This is why I do this shit
I think they call this, ventin'

[Verse One]
Look, uhh, this is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spillin' out like I hit a vein

What up Lil Braw, what up Slum Ville
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinkin' that we all signed for one mill'
Equal opportunities rappin', thit shit is unreal

That ain't how it works, that ain't that how it goes
And I been gettin' high to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer to balance my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows

And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to remembered and reprised
And I would be performin' just as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feelin' isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

[Drake speaking]
Don't take this the wrong way but...

[Verse Two]
I never cried when 'Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value
Then I would drop one for every single thing he showed us

And I'll be standin' in a puddle
I stay away from niggaz that could land me in some trouble
And I'ma keep it honest, I'm so tired of bein' subtle
It's just me, Forty O and nich standin' in a huddle

Starin' at the members of my team
Who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that I'm in debt for you defendin' all our dreams
I hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems

But y'all the reason for a lotta my devotion
You know I spend money 'cause spendin' time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles 'cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
Yeah, I swear that we makin' a killin' here
I should be on top of the world here just chillin' here

Uh, but it's funny havin' fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same

Yeah, and plus things are just so real at home
People think I've changed just because my appilla grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I'm never actually am alone, I just always feel alone

I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishin' for some things and now I'm used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fuckin' groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed

All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice everytime I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though I'm livin' out what you would call the dream

Yeah, and my uncle ain't even messagin' me
And him missin' in my life is kind of messin' with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things
It's funny how money can change everythin'

[Chorus]</pre>
