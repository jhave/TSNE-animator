[Chorus]
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at!
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at!
 
[Verse 1]
I'm in that Hot Thang, gutter lane
Dippin' with that wood grain
So fuckin' hood, mayne
They call me The Boogeyman
In that slow lane, what is your whole name?
I forgot this ho's name, I'll call her Louise Lane
Up on that boulevard, 24's rotate 
Ice Cube comin' through, gotta make the hoes wait
Roll at my own pace  nigga, don't hate!
Fuck all you fat-fuckers leanin' up against my paint!
Ice Cube, I steal a little paint (Movie star!)
Fuck you! Pour a nigga a lil' drink!
That's how it's goin' down out here in California
Listen to my people, when a nigga hit the corner!

[Chorus]
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at!
Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the flyest one of all?

[Verse 2]
Now pull in the parking lot
Nigga, find a parking spot
Fired up, everyone want to spark a lot
Puff-puff-pass, we out on Ave.
Lookin' for a big fat ass to harass!
Is it you? Uh-huh, I see you lookin'
When we roll by, pussy still cookin'
Freaks get tooken when they lookin' for stars 
If you don't like my face  bitch, look at my car!
Keep it simple, I told you once befo'
It really don't matter how I get you to the mo'
It really don't matter how I get you in my low
Just hop in, let's go
And let your friends know!

[Chorus]
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at!
Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the flyest one of all?
 
[Verse 3]
Do ya thang, girl!
Fuck what they lookin' at!
We the dogs gettin' chased by the pussycat
West Coast, baby - with so much gravy
You should call The Navy, ever since the 80's
I've been doin' good, they been doin' bad
When I see you walk by, I'm pursuin' that
But never chase it, my game is so basic
As soon as I lace it  baby, wanna taste it?
Just face it, put me to the test
Ice Cube would ace it, I'm built for success
Fuck a Rockstar! We wanna party like a Rap Star
In the club, in the house, or the backyard (Yay-yay!)
You make it rain with ones, I make it rain with hun's
And we get lap-dance from nuns 
They put away they crucifix
And they say, "Ice Cube  boy, you the shit!"

[Chorus]
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at!
Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the flyest one of all?
Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the flyest one of all?

[Bridge]
I see you lookin' at me
We don't give a fuck!
What you lookin' at?
We gonna give it up!

[Chorus]
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the flyest one of all?
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at!</pre>
