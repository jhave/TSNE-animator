[Intro: A$AP Nast]
Yo! Yo Yo! Yo! Yeah!
90's era Nast! Yeah! Yo!
Ty Beats!

[Verse One: A$AP Nast]
I need some time alone, cold my rhymes will turn your mind to stone
And that's the work of satan niggas be hatin but I'm a pot of gold
And this ain't just me rappin it's real and somethin you gots to know
Catch one more nigga hatin get him a casket that's bastard's 'bout to go
Whoa! Nasty baby I'm crazy the 90's raised me
I'm just as smart probably smarter than half of the cats who played me
Brazen, Driving Miss Daisy hit on my strap
In my zone mind on my money like where that shit at?!
I'm all alone that's my only hope
And be damned if I'm a chase that with some phony home
On the real, it be the ones that say we got this that you ain't alone
As long as I'm here, to pull out that glock 9 and cocked it
He mad you got rich, but on the low you should've watched him
Cats connivin, head first into the livest object
That was your man now you 'bout to die quick
Over some fly shit, you feel reminded of your fast life ventures and winters
Blinded 'til that flashlight enters

[Chorus: A$AP Nast]
Yo! I got a funky funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky funky style with a funky swag
I bought the funky funky Nikes got the hat to match
I bought the funky funky Nikes got the hat to match
I got a funky funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky funky style with a funky swag
And when I kill 'em with the flow ain't no comin back
And when I kill 'em with the flow ain't no comin back
Back!

[Interlude: A$AP Nast] (Method Man)
Huh! Back! (Listen! Yo! Yo!)

[Verse Two: Method Man]
I gotta funky man's panache I be stretchin the cash
I'm a little passive aggressive you could stretch when I'm mad
Borderline, manic depressive rappers stressin me bad
Got too many less than impressive rappers left in my path
Better yet we 'gon leave 'em left in the past
Someone slide this time I ride will get left in the back
Who am I? I'm a titan so be expectin a clash
Start to wavin arms at you you think I'm catchin a cab
No question 'cause the answer is if your lookin to ask
Look at Meth, breakin bad like you cookin meth in the lab
Still a lethal weapon but try and bless him with a math
Rappers never learn they lesson so I ain't lettin 'em pass
I ain't lettin 'em brag, I ain't lettin 'em swag
Bump swag just bein blunt while I'm pluckin my ash
Y'all ain't up in my clash in the buildin, It's A$AP Meth!
Quick to kill 'em that's an ASAP death

[Chorus: A$AP Nast]
Yo! I got a funky funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky funky style with a funky swag
I bought the funky funky Nikes got the hat to match
I bought the funky funky Nikes got the hat to match
I got a funky funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky funky style with a funky swag
And when I kill 'em with the flow ain't no comin back
And when I kill 'em with the flow ain't no comin back
Back!

[Verse Three: A$AP Nast]
Straight out the back dog I'm Shaq strong I'm breakin backboards
Draped in Tommy, my bitch beside me young God body
I play the back of the clubs click a file young as a Miley
Fools get rowdy, ain't lettin down my guns from Saudi
High off the Maui, don't trip your weed rollin fonti
You know the fronto, sucio guapo, I'm head honcho
I sport the poncho, connects with Sandro, the illest y'all know
Killin 'em pronto, my funky fresh is filthy
Designer but check my rhymes though, my verse is like atomic bombs yo
Haters like side hoes, I peel off in the illest Tahoe
Watch out for potholes, H leanin that's why he drive slow
Nast Diablo, the 90's era shit in effect
Clowns be watchin best +Protect Ya Neck+

[Interlude: A$AP Nast]
WHAT?! Told ya nigga what! HUH! 
TOLD THESE MU'FUCKERS NIGGA! A$AP MOB IN THIS MU'FUCKER!

[Chorus: A$AP Nast]
Yo! I got a funky funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky funky style with a funky swag
I bought the funky funky Nikes got the hat to match
I bought the funky funky Nikes got the hat to match
I got a funky funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky funky style with a funky swag
And when I kill 'em with the flow ain't no comin back
And when I kill 'em with the flow ain't no comin back
Back!

[Outro: A$AP Nast]
