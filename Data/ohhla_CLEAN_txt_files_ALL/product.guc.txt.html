[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
Eight, for them O's and a dollar for them balls
Eight throwin stove and some water in a pot
Wait until it's cold then watch it harden on the spot
Straight out the do' and put that product on the block, nigga

[Verse One]
I'm fin' to bounce back, up out this 20 flat
We got cook up, we got powder, nigga you want that?
I got a fish scale, I burn that white back
Don't need a glass man, I bring that blast back
Niggaz cain't wait 'til I hit the hood and cook it
If you wanna learn fuck nigga start lookin
I knock 'em out solid, shot in a circle
Sell a quarter brick then I cop a ounce of purple
Then the O's for..

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
We got eight for the O's and a dollar for them balls
Soon as I finish my ball might hit the mall
Got stacks on deck and they ten feet tall
(Oh you moochin ass niggaz?) Man y'all money too small
Pyrex check, baking soda check
Then you put that fish scale in that water next
Twelve by twelves, nigga hit your front steps
Serve e'ry fuckin fiend 'til there's nothin left

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I charge eight for the O's, seventeen for a thirty-six
Nine for a half, fifty-five for a quarter brick
Traphouse, crackhouse, slab a jacker back out
Nigga want some beef then I have to bring the Mack out
Drug deals; eight dollars for the X pill
Put a big bullet hole where you chest is
Never broke but I hope that the boat with the dope
don't sink just float as I sell plenty coke

[Chorus]</pre>
