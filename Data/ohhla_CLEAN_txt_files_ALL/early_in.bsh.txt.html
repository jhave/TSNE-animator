[Baby Bash]
Ah
Heh
For 'sho
That lighter don't work (For 'sho)
That lighter don't work
Told you (Uh hun)
I'm just sayin' though
Ha ha

Chorus 1: Baby Bash
Early in the mornin'
'Fore I eats my breakfast
I gotta get down
Early in the mornin'
'Fore I eats my breakfast
I gotta get down

Chorus 2: Baby Bash
Late night in the evenin'
'Fore I gets to sleepin'
I gotta get down
Late night in the evenin'
'Fore I gets to sleepin'
I gotta get down

(Verse 1)
Oh goody, goody, got the mornin' woody
Roll over so quick
Baby girl, give it to me
Mayne, what a quickie, stabbin', with a stiffy
Bustin' bigger nuts than Peter Pan and Jiffy
Give me a little licky, huggy and kissy-kissy
And off last night, I'm still a little wiggy
Forgive me, girl, if I damage ya
But it feel like I'm on Viagra

Repeat Chorus 1

[Baby Bash]
Says I gotta get down
Said I gotta get down
Says I gotta get down

(Verse 2)
Well, I'm a Cheech, I'm a Chong
Grab the water bong
Hit it for so strong, and hold it for so long
I'm a rip, I'm a run, roll the whole blunt
Grab the visine, I'm feelin'
So crunked
Check
My watch, connect
My dots
Scratch my crotch, jump in the flip flops
All I hear is pots and pans with the sizzle
Chorizo con huebos, mayne, it's off the hizzle
Chokin' on that residue
I told y'all, mayne, when I'm fenced to do
You know hydro, he a friend of mine
Take the monkey off my back like everytime
Got estylo
That's so frio
Fly like an eagle, so high
Me and my amigo
Another day, another dollar
Another deal
What you say, hun, what, when you wanna kill

Repeat Chorus 1

Pre-Verse: Baby Bash
Who that
Comin' through
What's really crack-a-lackin', what's up with you
Oh, no, not him again
He be rollin' with them crazy ass Mexicans

(Verse 3)
Baby Bash, you a fool, On Tha Cool, off you sayin' though
You keeps it real, what them other boys playin' for
Holla
Holla
Almighty dollar
Got everybody thinkin' it's cool to hate another
But, mayne, hold up, I'm on a new page
Y'all some haters on my mix, get out my Kool Aid
I'm quick to spark up, and steal somebody lighter
I get cotton mouth, and eat some (???)

Hook: Baby Bash
Oh my, my, ah
Oh, hell, yeah
Before I make love, I puts it
In the air
Twice Last Night, and once in the mornin'
I gotta get down, so I, can gets goin'

Repeat Chorus 1 &amp; 2

Repeat Chorus 1

[Baby Bash]
Says I gotta get down
Said I gotta get down
Says I gotta get down</pre>
