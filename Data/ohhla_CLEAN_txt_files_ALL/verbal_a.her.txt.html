[Intro - Cartoon Characters]
"Like, uh, this is your lucky day, see.
 I will uh like, you know, fill you in how come.
 Suppose you like didn't, uuuh,
 run up to a couple of sweet guy like us."
"Heavens no!"
"Oh yeah well we wouldn't want that to happen."
"So I tell you what we're gonna do."
"Oh let's just dispense with formalities
And uh, get down to like business."

"This is verbal anime, graphic animation" - Iriscience

[Iriscience]
I've seen ghosts in the shell, ninja scrolls, and a curer
But the illest character I've seen was in the mirror
Open up the world, people lend me an ear
It's a family affair and let me make that clear
Raaka, I keep my propaganda proper
In circles I'm high, swing blades like helicopters
In this stage of my life I choose to develop shock words
While cats look lost without the teleprompters
Federado tour duty, medal of honor
Since life is a battle your best bet is betting on it
Check the conference, we on stage with weapons on us
Microphones, straight Robin Hoods, its economics
Yes yes, it all starts with a sketch
Snapshots, motion pictures and special effects
We stretch the game out, we expand the nation
And this is verbal anime graphic animation

[Chorus x2]
Funk imagination
Come to illustration
Then we bring pictures to life
We call it animation

[Iriscience]
You got to know the time like the grand verbalizer
It's time, Iriscience with The Herbaliser
A light this bright might burn through your visor
I know you want to squint, but, open your eyes up!
I jump up and let the earth spin round
And don't come down 'til I'm floating over your town
Nothing to prove, making the people move
Whether double-decker bus, taxi or the tube
Mind the cap, we did crime now we climb the map
Check how I spit rhyme to rap
Yes yes, it all starts with a sketch
Snapshots, motion pictures and special effects
We stretch the game out, expand the nation
This is verbal anime graphic animation
Ohhhhhh, Herbaliser, U.K, CA, LA, all day

[Chorus X2]
Funk imagination
Come to illustration
Then we bring pictures to life
We call it animation

[Iriscience]
I trade money at the Combio, dollars for pounds
Massacre, musical murder I'm killing your sound!
But hardly softly, how's that feel to you now?
I chew raw iron and I spit steel to the crowd
Magnetic attraction don't repel
I attract retail, underground rebel
Dilated Peoples: the few, the proud, the brave
Nice in the studio and +Live On Stage+
Drop so many bars I leave the beat in a cage
Some are courageous, some afraid to turn the page
Rappers stacking rhymes, you can take a quick look
And animate my lyric sheets like a flipbook
Thoughts in effect it all starts with a sketch
Snapshots, motion pictures and special effects
Stretch the game out, expand the nation
This is verbal anime graphic animation
