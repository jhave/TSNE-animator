[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
Aiyyo MIMS!!! I don't really do this
There's somethin about her was drivin me loose
It's, I guess it's the way she move it from left to right, left to right
She look like that chick from Clueless

I told her this is how we do it all damn night, all damn
When she walk out she dem a talk 'bout
Di gal deh pon fire, and dem caan put out
I'm suicidal, and I turn back

When mi spit every man where's dem lighters? Lighters!

[Verse 5: MIMS]
Look! It's seems like I gotta make a enemy
To sell another record in this industry
Or it seems like I gotta be righteous, to get on that five mic list
I gotta write like that and not like this
I ain't hot to them, cause I'm not with Jay and I'm not with Em
See I bop to Fox and I rock to Kim
And TS is hot but I'm not with them
I'm a New York cat and I love the South
I got a New York bop but with a West Coast bounce
Mix that with a little bit of Reid and Cham
International MIMS find me in France
London, Japan, Mulan, Sudan
I don't need to smoke weed I'm in Amsterdam
Try to figure my figures I plead the fifth
But if you wanna get down then you gotta proceed
