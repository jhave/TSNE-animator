[Verse 1]
Hip hop, modern time, flossy and raw so self-absorbed, immature
I can't remember being this bored
Fake bonanza, there come real wars
Bullets burn through the candy on the driver side door
Long investigations and no firm lead, billion dollar flow
And black life is still cheap
Your rent skyrockets and y'all prospects plummet
Ten murders, ten days, this summer
Talk about today's mathematics, a eighth, an O, a key
And the caliber on your rack, shit
The inmate number, the centerfolds for measurement
Is close as a coed cell come to some tendon-is
I heard them say it was all about the Benjamins
I don't believe it now, didn't believe it then, fuck wutcha heard
You believe wutcha want, the truth is what it is, it be what it been
Get rich, shorty just tryna live
Don't believe in heaven and ain't tryna get in
And hell is everyday, fuck the world anyway
Potion and sips, spark up a clip, FADE AWAY!

[Hook]
The low lights, tree top heights
Be careful how you move the traps are covered in the lights
Landmines be disguised as welcome signs
I'll repeat it so you ain't got to press rewind
The landmines be disguised as welcome signs
Black fresh from Iraq, a wild look in his eyes, missing part of his arm
What the fuck is your problem!? Ohh lord! Fake Bonanza!

[Verse 2]
Gladiator, circus world
Glamour, pussy, pimp, ho good to serve this world
Paranoid, if she trick a nigga nervous world
Shade-tonic natural order in reversal world
The ipod, no God, zero circle world
The blow-a turtle world, smoke from the purple world
The killer murder world, hamburger murder world
Open twenty-four hours, all about them dollars
Pretty poison, devoid choices
Cold coffee and more coffers, fake bonanza (2x)
Huh? What? I don't understand ya!
What they talking bout save they soul, ohh lord, save they soul!
Help them reach the goal, peace! (4x)
You know, peace (3x), boogieman! Don't be scared
Ohh lord, save they soul (2x) Ohh lord, save my soul (2x) Please
Boogieman

[Outro]
Woke up this morning with my, my state don't fade and said I
Had the baddest feeling, maybe you stayed on my mind, said I (2x)
Woke up this morning in my, my state, I'm dreaming, dreaming
Ain't nothing even.....dreaming, praying, keeping
Woke up this morning and my mind stayed on freedom
Woke up this demon that keep staying on my mind
Said, woke up this morning and my mind stayed on freedom
It makes no difference what people say, AHHHHHHHHH</pre>
