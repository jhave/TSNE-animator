[Verse 1]
I was almost head over heels 
I was almeost the man of your dreams
And you almost had me sprung
You were almost my only one

[Bridge]
Just about had me hooked, 'til I had to take a second look 
Almost in love 
Just about had me hooked, 'til I had to take a second look 
Almost in love 

[Verse 2]
Girl you almost made me change my code
And you almost made my pockets grow hoes
Not only did you almost 
Make me buy you gold 
Downtown you almost make me go

[Bridge]
Just about had me hooked, 'til I had to take a second look 
Almost in love 
Just about had me hooked, 'til I had to take a second look 
Almost in love 

[Verse 3]
The roses we picked just yesterday 
Seemed to have wiltered away 
And we've been on the ground 
Looking for a four-leaf clover but there's been no luck 
Baby I guess it's over 
But we almost make it to the finished line called love
Almost and there's no need to raise our voices
Unless we're singing in harmony
But we're not 'cause there's no harmony
But we almost make it Almost

[Chorus]
Almost in love
Almost in love
Almost in love
Almost in love</pre>
