Typed by: timm2014@hotmail.com

[Chorus]
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out
Out
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out
Out
Always on my mind
I can feel you now

[Verse One]
As a child I asked Jesus why
Why you let the good die?
Too often, too early
We got to say goodbye
Is it even worth to try?
What was preached, what we reached when we touched the sky
Or is it just a fuckin' lie?
So many funerals, I can't even fuckin' cry
Just get drunk and smoke, let my brains fry
I seen niggas smoke, right before my eyes
Couple inches closer coulda been me in some niggas rhymes
Strange times
I just read the signs
Goin' out of business, need a witness, it's the end times
Don't know where we goin' 
But we goin' fast
Outta control, feel like the globe about to crash
Earthquakes, hurricanes, floods is all the news flash
Everyday get hotter
Nowhere near summer
So the streets is hotter
Raise the murder number
With all this evil gotta be a God, I sit and wonder

[Chorus]
(I can't figure it, I can't figure it out
Out)
Why the fuck we always gotta struggle?
Wake up, hit the block, gotta hustle
Never get a break, it's always more trouble
(I can't figure it, I can't figure it out
Out)
Why we poor and ain't got no money
No food, gotta go to sleep hungry
Survivin' in a cold world that really don't want me
(Always on my mind)
All the people not here today
(I can feel you now)
Why the Lord have to take you away?

[Verse Two]
Behold The Rider Of The Pale Horse
Niggas need to read more than just skimmin' through the fuckin' Source
It's got a soft course
Of course
That's how it's suppose to be, just look more closely
You probably not gonna like what you're gonna see
I'm on the streets but still don't feel free
What the pigs do?
Beat me, cuff me
What the judge do?
Sentence me, fuck me
To a small box, the ghetto's biggest cell blocks
We in prison too , but can't see the locks
Real life Matrix, can't unplug or escape it
Livin' in this society, just a bunch of fake shit
Feel like Kanye, wanna take a +Spaceship+
Fly away, fly away and never come back
But gravities a bitch, she always pull me back
Every time I try to fly
I just fall flat
 
[Chorus]
(I can't figure it, I can't figure it out
Out)
Why the fuck we always gotta struggle?
Wake up hit the block, gotta hustle
Never get a break, it's always more trouble
(I can't figure it, I can't figure it out
Out)
Why we poor and ain't got no money?
No food, gotta go to sleep hungry
Survivin' in a cold world that really don't want me
(Always on my mind)
All the people not here today
(I can feel you now)
Why the Lord have to take you away?
 
[Verse Three]
The rich gettin' richer, the poor gettin' poorer
The sick gettin' sick of gettin' fucked over and over
They waitin' on Christ
Allah
Jehovah
To save they lives, help 'em rise up, keep they hopes up
  Negligentpresident
Keep the nation broke up
A family sends his soldiers to get blown up
Sons, daughters, mothers, fathers come back in pine boxes
They died for nothin', George Bush ain't even fuckin' bother
Little faggot, got a question little bastard
Since you started all this shit why your kids ain't get drafted?
America, America, home of the brave
Would have sacrificed they own people just to get paid
Keep us afraid
Keep us confused
Fightin' each other, can't tell who's who
Amidst all this shit, my granny back on life support
Got my hand in her hand, feel her breaths gettin' short
I'm like
 
[Chorus]
(I can't figure it, I can't figure it out
Out)
Why the fuck we always gotta struggle?
Wake up hit the block, gotta hustle
Never get a break, it's always more trouble
(I can't figure it, I can't figure it out
Out)
Why we poor and ain't got no money?
No food, gotta go to sleep hungry
Survivin' in a cold world that really don't want me
(Always on my mind)
All the people not here today
(I can feel you now)
Why the Lord have to take you away?</pre>
