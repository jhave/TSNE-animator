Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
You can drop a "Wet Floor" sign down for the tears
God and my court date, the two things I fear
Man, they tryna give a nigga years
I'm tryna figure if I should even appear, or
Should I escape town? Catch a Greyhound
Change my name, right  catch a plane flight
Out the country, let them ma'fuckas hunt me
Come and catch me if you want me
Know they'll lock me if I stay
But... where I'mma run to?
I got a good girl, we got a son too
And all we went through, we ain't see eye-to-eye
But what you told me way back, you was a ride-or-die
So if they give me one, or give me two
Or if a nigga gotta sit down and do a few
Before I go, baby, I gotta know, what would you do?
Would you find someone new or would you stay?
Like the hoes when they lay with me?
Puppy eyes when I go, sayin' "stay with me"
Aw, girl, you bad as Hell
And yet I'd love to 
But see I got a girl I'm really makin' love to
Therefore I'm feelin' a lot more guilty when I rub you
That's why I skip all of that kissin' when I fuck you
Flush the condom down the toilet then I skate
I had you, but you can't have me, I never stay

[Chorus]
Stay...

[Verse 2]
Ha! Life in a hometown, 'fore I could take a step
I'm gettin' grown now
And startin' to notice that I see the same hoes 'round
Guess they had to go 'round, my raps is profound
I got the flows but yet a nigga ain't got no sound
Copped a beat machine, I'm cookin' up my own now
Got my mind on the city where it goes down
See, if I'mma get to where I'm goin' then I can't stay
Although I love it here
I'll be damned if I sit around another year
Dreamin' dreams, hopin' somehow that they just appear
The hardest part of leavin' is to know my mother's here
Oh, but I'm comin' back  oh boy, believe that
Let's show the lil' niggas, boy, you can achieve that
Got the city on my shoulders, piggy back
Hello, my name is Cole and I'm here to stay...

[Chorus]</pre>
