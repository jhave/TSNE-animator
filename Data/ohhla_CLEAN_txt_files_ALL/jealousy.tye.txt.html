MIA missin' in action
Brother get away
I can prove the lazer bein' running in my back
Piercin', penetratin'
How do I react to jealousy?
My best friend's telling other people my biz
People I don't like tryin' to find where ever I live
People I grew up with, ????-?
Turning their backs ??? make no money though
And if I did, you'll be the first person to smile
And if I did, I'll be the first one ???
And when you do, you can pose on my skateboard
'Cause I'm not tryin' to move with no snake forth
One of the main reasons I'm checking for you
Is you could spread rumours just to brake up the crew
And as you tryin' to understand what my mind is about
The only thing you get from me is "hi hello" and I'm out

Then I pulled out my house keys rolled up on his BM
Stressed a whole line in the side
And singed my name too

[Chorus] 2x

[Ty]
Mama never told me it would be like this
Stiff upper lips, thruth face, tight wrists
With anger and ??-?
Watching others chillin' on levels that we wanna be on
It's a common ?accurrence? ??? respected by
Would be a liar if I wasn't affected by
Hate, fever and the shape of a meat cleaver
Tripping through the nerve ends like a ???
The girlfriends
Jealous of who I talk to women
Constant arguments always leave my head spinning
I thought we sorted this out in the beginning
When she ??? her ex-man I'm not grinning
I'm telling you
I've been frightened in this feeling since the influence
It takes over in a instant
it's like a great cloud about to bloom
and I don't understand ??? walk ???

[Chorus] 2x

Whyy
Whyy
