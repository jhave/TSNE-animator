[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
WHOO! Yeah yeah (Swizzie!)

I'ma get it poppin like I'm used to (let's get it poppin)
 
[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Do y'all niggaz bust ya guns? (Hell yeah we bust our guns!)
Do y'all fuck 'em 'til they cum? (Damn right we make 'em cum!)
Do y'all niggaz bust ya guns? (Hell yeah we bust our guns!)
Do y'all fuck 'em 'til they cum? (Damn right we make 'em cum!)
I make 'em all say (all say)
OH-OHH, OH-OHH, OH-OHH, OH-OHH
OH-OHH, OH-OHH, OH-OHH, OH-OHH (let's go)
 
[Verse One: Swizz Beatz]
Be in the scene, I'm makin that cream
Them haters always say "What the hell does that mean?"
I'm comin through your block, got somethin mean (mean)
The Ferrari pink, it blings (blings)
Yep, I got suede in my dash
I got your chick ready to kiss my ass
I go to the club man, it's no cash
That black card make them chicks move FAHST
Can you hear me now? Can you see me now?
I throw on my jeans tucked then it's out now
T.I. made them suckas +Bring it Out+ now
The Ruff Ryders start it, now just shout it!
 
[Chorus] w/ ad libs
 
[Verse Two: Swizz Beatz]
Man... now engine engine, number 9
You talkin crazy, you lose your mind
And if that chucker wanna throw that stack
Well pick it up, HEY, pick it up - you don't know me
But Kanye know my name; Timbo, know my name
Pharrell, know my name; Scotty, know my name
Came in the game at 16 and changed the game up
C-Came in the game at 16 and changed the game up
Kicks, snares, change the beat game
C-Cali like Big said, and Big did
I hope nobody got offended what I said
You wanna act crazy I aim for your head {*BLAM*}
 
[Chorus] w/ ad libs
 
[Swizz Beatz]
I got a special guest for y'all
He go by the name of Drag dash, get 'em man!
 
[Verse Three: Drag-On]
Guess who's back in your buildin ya big pimpin
Drag-dash-On, now come on, look two childrens
It's Drag dash BITCH, Mr. Backdraft BITCH
Bust a slug like I blub, blap-blap BITCH (we're not done)
Bitches know, niggaz love the way my flow SWITCH
Scratch my twinkles, tingle make a nigga ITCH
I ain't gotta tell you how I spit propane
I'm at the gun range cause I ain't got no aim (talk to 'em Drag!)
Get at you rappers spit the stank in yo' lane
My shit been clappin since Don did "The Soul Train"
I'm back like when baking soda do cocaine
Drag to the dash, I'm in the hood like lo mein
 
[Chorus] w/ ad libs
