[A.G.]
Peace to K. Shabazz, while I get you open like a gash
Pass the nickle if you think you can last
MC's that slept got caught with the chin check
Never slept cause them suckers could have been wet
Now I'm here to bring use to my name
Used to the slang, producer bang
Give me room, cause what I consume makes me gloom 
To the man that I am, cause I am what I am
Those who had soul was told to clap
That was back, now it's '94 and I'm back
With the Ghetto Dwellas, still rolling with my fellas
With the herbs, I'm strutting, there's nothing you can tell us
To recall and sing, my peeps who never fronted
Back the fuck up while they keep acting like they want it

	You want it? I gots to give it to ya!  (Repeat 4x)

[Diamond]
I soar through the sky like a dirty city pigeon
Preview of the next LP, here's a smidgen
Of the roughness, you know the ill off the cuffness
You can't break it or bend it, cause the toughness
Is manifested from my lyrical flow
And niggas start sweating like they just did some blow
Yo, dough is not a fuss
I got the honeys running all night like the 21 bus
Sally got a one track mind
But now she got a black eye, cause she tried to take mine
Another day in the hood
Chilling with Show &amp; A.G., Walli World, yo it's all good
Let me proceed with the swiftness
I overlook niggas like Jehovah's Witnesses do Christmas
So roll it up and get blunted
Rhyme for rhyme, we can go if you want it, bitch

	You want it? I gots to give it to ya!  (Repeat 4x)

[A.G.]
We keeps it bouncing, Gary Lethal get the ounce and
Roll one, I'm the fountain you got to flow from
Straight up, all foes get ate up 
Willies keep your weight up, nope I hope you're not calling me
Stalling, cause that roughness is all in me
I rip ya, cause my rapture will rupture
Check the richter, there's no rapper who's rougher
Producer tougher than my man and his machine
Don't sweat the cream, bet the green
I'm on the humble, and not afraid to rumble
With those who wanna outlast the jungle, they tumble, I run through
So build fences or come to your senses
My skills are endless with the one two (The one two)

	You want it? I gots to give it to ya!  (Repeat 4x)</pre>
