[Verse 1]
Yea these niggaz like haters want to fight me
Yea these niggaz mad cuz I came up over night B
Yea I switch it up I got 9 kuff tightly
So you betta do the right thing like Spike Lee
Yep I'm superclean rock jeans wit a white tee
Niggaz round here soft but like niggaz want to bite me
If you had some figures you will be just like me
Yea these niggaz mad cuz I shining like a light B
Niggaz talking bout yep in there muthafuckin throwback
He ain't real you know dat ? y he sold that
We stepping on these niggaz like a muthafuckin door mat
When I hit the scene they take pictures call me Kodak
These hoes goin crazy like think they need some prozac
We the hottest thing that ya rockin and you no dat
Yo bitch chosed up and she don't want to go back
We stackin big faces cuz we still spending ?

(Chorus 16X)
Ohh I think they like me

[Verse 2]
Haters want 2 fight me I'm snatching ya ass up
First nigga act up first nigga get bust
???????????????????????????????
T-shirt stravaganza (franchize the white tee boyz)
Self made self paid we latch around in our white tee
Ashy black shirt well get down in ya brown tee
My hundred throwback we sport a jersey by Ali
And if he make one (then all them sike me)
I'm all about my cash ride around wit a nice peace
Ear piece icy they straight like me
You heard pimpin playa ( they shine so brightly)
Don't stand so close vision will ?
Respect my whole squad no you can't even touch us cuz
Role out the red carpet high 5 and show us love
Carry barretas count cheddar we transedda

(chorus)

I luv to muthafuckin fight 
but when shit get thick I grab the k he grab the pipe
So when I'm wrong or he right</pre>
