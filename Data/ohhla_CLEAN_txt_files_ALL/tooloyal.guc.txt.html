[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Mr. Zone 6'er, rock two pistols (BOW) {*2X*}
Fucked three sisters, iced out crystals
Mi-Mr. Zone 6'er, Mi-Mr. Zoner 6'er

[Gucci Mane]
I'm too hood, I'm too turnt (turnt)
Ain't been an hour and a quarter pound burnt
Mr. Zone 6'er, rock two pistols (BOW)
Fucked three sisters, iced out crystals
Tell you like you wanna know, iced out shorty
Got a glow, blue block party, and you better know (POW)
Fuckin bitches every show, one for the cheese
Two for the ki's, three's for the P's, go for the O.G.'s
I'm so sleaze I hit your main squeeze (geah)
Rollin on 30's, like you rollin on D's (wow)
It beez Gucci Goo-Wop
In the South top Beemer that's convertible top

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm too fuckin loyal; you too fuckin spoiled
Bitch I'm gone off that hard, Brick Squad we barred
Them boys are high {*3X*}
We ballin out {*3X*} - I'm too fuckin loyal

[Waka Flocka Flame]
They said I'm steamin, I'm bubblin, from the fire up
You got loud better fire it up
Call me a one-hit wonder I'll switch my flow up
Drop "No Hands" with Roscoe Dash, now I've blowin up
I'm (ballin out) everywhere you see me is money on the ground
'Caine one bleaches me, in for a pound (flags)
Higher than a motherfucker I smoked 'bout a pound
I love to throw hundreds screamin stripper bitch drown~!
Girls all around me run me down
I drink, go bomb, {?} me round
Pants down, Brick Squad we the shit
Waka Flocka Flame the 2011 {?} Mitch

[Chorus]

[Slim Dunkin]
Brick Squad young'n
Catch me with a groupie chick, I be on my groupie shit
Hotel, motel, try and shoot a groupie flick
Bang bang, skeet skeet, Sturdy Pete, blew the crib
Dumped out the flag fuck, coolin with the stewardess
Hoe like OH MY GOD, look in my garage
This ain't no facade, sleepwalkin on them bars
I got me on free, link get me the Z
Red Bull give me wings, pit be robbin ching
Money I'ma get to it, neckpiece, igloo it
Shoot a hundred bet a hundred crapped out and redo it
It ain't nuttin to a boss nigga, put down
I'm so fuckin loyal Gucci tellin me to sit down

[Chorus]</pre>
