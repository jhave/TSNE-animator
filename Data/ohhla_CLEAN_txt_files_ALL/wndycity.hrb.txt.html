Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
This the windy city
We ain't only blowing money
We got windy semis
We ain't only throwing hundreds
We got plenty 50's
This the windy city
Alot of niggas looking at me gon' be pretty shitty
They seeing how I'm on my grind and feeling really silly
And all this money on my mind just screaming "come and get me"
My team gotta see me shine so they coming with me
The whole hunned 50
We from the windy city

This money relax my mind like a ibuprofen
If a nigga get outta line that's who I be smoking
And these bitches blowing my line just cus I be stroking
Always catch me holding the nine, yes I be totting
My niggas rolling
Rolling off a triple stack
This beef ain't what you seeking fam
So what the fuck you looking at?
You look at us we looking back
He threatened me then took it back
The smart nigga look at that
The trap is not a clubhouse
We really in here cooking that
That Audi not a shopping cart
But nigga I be pushin that
We ridin with them choppas in the stash
Don't get looken at
And if we pull up on you we gon' blast
Now you tooken back
I'm known to do the dash so now you chasing
And we looking back
I'm all about that cash
So I'm out here making moves
Niggas plottin I can watch em
Body language giving clues
And they only make me angry
Like they want to make the news
You a shooter, talk is cheap
That's a statement you should prove

[Chorus]</pre>
