Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Fresh Prince]
For years I have been waitin and hesitatin to make a
rap record, that had the pace of a
slow song, quiet storm, chillin while the fire is warm
You and your girl, with this record on
your radio or stereo, I don't know
I love you so is what you'll be sayin, while this record's playin
You reminscin and kissin your girl
Relax, lay back, unwind, cause now is time to chill

Setting the mood, by the use of this groove
is an ingenious, perceptive, brilliant, a very clever move
Because the bassline, combined with the fresh rhyme
at a slow tempo enticed passion to grow
But if it's not passion, for which you search
then use the song as a massage after a hard day's work
And if it's true that music calms the savage beast
Play this cut in the jungle and put the lions to sleep
Take a deep breath, stretch, kick off your footwear
Put on the tape of this record, but beware
Caution, warning, it's your decision
There's nothin stronger that you can buy, without prescription
It's soothing, somewhat hypnotic
A rhythmic anesthetic it's practically a narcotic
You want it?  We got it -- come get it we're widdit
Because it's all at the push of a button, yo Jeff, hit it!

The objective, of this musical extravaganza
is to enlighten you, stanza by stanza
Verse after verse, have been precisely arranged
Rearranged and then changed until the best remained
The result being, this incredible song
So for at least eight hours a day, you'll have this record on
In the morning and at night in your room
And all through the afternoon, you will be
listening, mentally rapped up in the cut
Some people will sit down and some will choose to get up
But whatever you choose, just keep your ear to the wax
Because we got somethin def that other rappers lack
We haven't been able to put our fingers on what it is
But it's different and it's def and it appeals to kids
and teens and adults and senior citizens too
And I'd be willing to bet, that it appeals to you, too!
So if you're not into rap, give us a chance
to change your mind, and to make you dance
to this lyrical miracle, this musical discovery
But yo I wanna chill for a second, yo Jeff, cover me

It's like paradise, this music is nice
It makes you hot if you want it too, or twice as cold as ice
It brings love to the heart of a criminal
With this subliminal power, all the women'll
flock while all the guys rocks, when it's on your box
It gained us a much bigger reputation than the White Sox
You may ask yourself are we that famous?
Bust this, the Queen of Spain knows what my real name is
Our time is runnin short so I'll bid you farewell
You know this cut is so def, that you have been overwhelmed
Be cool, be chill, relax, have no fear..
.. I'm outta here</pre>
