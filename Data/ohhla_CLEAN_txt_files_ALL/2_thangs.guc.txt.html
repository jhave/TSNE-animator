[Chorus]
Young Gucci Mane got a style so strange
Every word I use might mean two thangs
Young Gucci Mane got a style so strange
Every word I use might mean two thangs
Young Gucci Mane got a style so strange
Every word I use might mean two thangs
Young Gucci Mane got a style so strange
Every word I use don't mean two thangs

[Gucci Mane]
Uhhh...
It ain't the money it's the principle (uhh)
What kind of student make mo' money than the principal?
And I never made the Honor Roll (uhh)
But I'm in the lunchline with a honor roll
You pumpin iron in the weight room (uhh)
I'm on the grind got a nine in the weight room
And I never played softball (uhh)
but I always kept the hard and the softballs
You doin math on the calculator (uhh)
I'm weighin slabs doin math on a calculator
And I ain't tryin to write no essays (uhh)
I'm tryin to get a hundred pounds for my eses
You tryin learn how to speak spanish (uhh)
but my connect tryin teach me to speak Spanish
And you a monitor in the hallway (uhh)
I'm all day on the grind with a four-way

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Uhh...
You the one who won the spelling bee (uhh)
I'm the first third grader wit a felony
And I never was a teacher's pet (uhh)
I'm the one who went and stole the teacher's cigarettes
And I never went on field trips (uhh)
I'm at Walter's tryin to buy me some stash slips
And I always been cutthroat (uhh)
Fifteen takin big niggaz Starter coats
Laflare Entertainment by myself (uhh)
But I used to have a high right, low left
Gettin money by the truckloads (uhh)
Rollin up big fat el productos
Before I drank V.S.O.P. Remy
I used to drank that MD 20-20
Woodgrain and reverse 8's (uhh)
Box Chevy trunk soudin like a earthquake

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Uhhh...
I gotta give it to you raw man (uhh)
Cause I still keep a trunk full of raw man
I'm a nigga from the block man (uhh)
In the club put it down with the block man
You probably gotta work a 9 to 5 (uhh)
I'm on the grind with the nines for the fifty-five
Get you a half of a 12 (uhh)
Low key bucket tryin to duck 12's
So what's up wit them t-shirts (uhh)
I got a t-shirt tucked under my t-shirt
Better watch yo' fuckin tone man (uhh)
cause you know that Gucci keep a tone man

[Chorus]

[Outro]
