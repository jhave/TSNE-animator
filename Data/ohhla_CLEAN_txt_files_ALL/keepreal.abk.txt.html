Song:   Keep it Real
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's time to be real y'all
It's time to be real y'all
I said it's time to be real y'all

First breathe
Started off a bad ass
East side roamin
Out late gettin cash
Killas don't talk
So I can't say shit
So read between the lines
And just paint your own pic
Hustlin baby
On the grind
I was brought up right
But stayed outta line
Guess you can say when you lose
You're lost
But wit my parents passin on
I had to be boss

[Chorus:]
I'ma keep it real
I'ma keep it real
It's all I've ever known
I'ma keep it real
I'ma keep it real

Couldn't nobody give me rules
Every now and then a jail cell
But what's that prove
I was still bein hard headed
Claimin the streets
(We have a red skinded male here disturbin the streets)
Problems problems, everybody's got em
Jack and sticc and cut and shoot and rob and
I was addicted to all
Had to change and find a better way
To be well off

[Chorus]

Nowadays I got a strong mind
I see it all
No need for safety nets
Cuz I will never fall
Keep it floatin like a ghost at night
And put fear in those who's eyes just ain't right
I got angels watchin over
I can feel em when I'm speakin
Like they're on my shoulder
And I admit that it sure feels good
To finally get a chance to be understood
Hard times was broke payin dues
Made a lot of friends and I met a lot of fools
That's why I'm here on the mic today
Cuz I'ma be real and tell you what I need to say

[Chorus]</pre>
