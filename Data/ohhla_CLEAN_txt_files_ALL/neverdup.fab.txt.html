Song:   Never Duplicated
Typed by: sbobshaw@hotmail.com

Uh, yes I am often imitated
But I am never duplicated, yeah
Yes I am often imitated
But I am never duplicated

(Verse 1)
I can't deny it, you's a dick rider
You can never flow like me, blow like me
Why would a bitch like ya?
She can see that I'm a fuckin rider, you a hitch hiker
I'm walkin in some shoes, they can't make fit ya
Got millions of paper that you can't take with ya
I don't wanna talk and I can't take pictures
Listen to your demo, I'll handshake with ya
Excuse you, who's you?
If I need a stunt double I'll use you
Pardon y'all, I don't wanna step on y'all toes
Seperate the authentic from the replica flows
And the kid be places you could never be at
So that can never be this, and this can never be that
These niggaz got some audacity
Sell some records as fast as me
Or sell some tickets out as fast as me
Motherfucker

(Chorus) (x2)
Yes I am often imitated (yes he is often imitated)
But I am never duplicated (but he is never duplicated)

So all that y'all can do is hate it

(Verse 2)
None of these wannabes really come close
I feel like I'm watchin the MTV show Christina Milian hosts
Everybody know this brother got it
Way before everybody and their mother got it
They still wonder how he sound like he do
If I was you, I'd wanna sound like me too
'Cause I got M's, they got G's and they all right
But they not me
They hear how I spit it on a station
Now they wanna put me on they singles just to get an imitation
No, I can't make an appearance
Give you a cheap fee or break on a clearance
I'm what your label hoped it could be
That's why they trying to mould your little ass, into a sculpture of me
With the ladies it'll be like leader, she like real
Y'all trying to be like me and be like ill

(Chorus) (x2)

So all that y'all can do is hate it

(Verse 3)
I'm real
It's the way I talk, the way I walk
It ain't my fault
I won't let nothin' on two legs stop me
'Cause the real is always better than the bootleg copy
Like I ain't show 'em the white and yellows at the same time
Throw backs and pin wheels at the same time
Like I'm scared to drop at the same time
I'll show you how to do this young'n
I ain't frontin'
These Jordan's ain't comin'
It ain't nothin'
Keep the complaints comin'
Can't hop on my bandwagon
Jump in my blue flames
You should not try, you are not I
It's the dude with the Grammy grin
It's no relation if it ain't a street family kin
So won't the real Fabolous please stand up
Please stand up
Please stand up

(Chorus) (x2)

So all that y'all can do is hate it</pre>
