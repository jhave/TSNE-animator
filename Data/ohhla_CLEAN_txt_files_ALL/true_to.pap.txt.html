True To This Shit
Don't give ME NO LIP, I got my hand on that MENO GRIP
Papoose packing strong carrying THREE FOUR FIFTH's
Nobody move I'm a roll it off your FEET ON THIS
Head crack head crack CEE-LO SIX
Don't start no shit won't BE NO QUIT
If you stuttered or not is going to BE SOME BITCH
Stop telling me what kind of deal HE GOIN GET
That nigga drool on the track dog HE DON'T SPIT
You niggaz copy my style on some KINKO SHIT
Your two shots on some FREE THROW SHIT
One minute these rappers hungry the next minute HE SO RICH
Til you give him a knuckle sandwich make him EAT YO FIST
HE SOLD ZIP talkin bout HE SOLD SIX
Your album was a brick like a KILO BITCH
I don't understand what kind of niggaz HE ROLL WIT
You keep getting robbed and you don't know who THIEFED YO SHIT
How you think your man got up on his FEET SO QUICK
You God damn dummy it BE YO CLICK
Heard them niggaz crept up on you on some LILO SHIT
Emptied on your whole ride swiss CHEESED YO WHIP
He emptied his whole gun and you ain't SQUEEZE YO SHIT
A nigga empty on me better RELOAD QUICK
His stomach louder then his mouth when he SPEAK THOU FLIP
Cause we don't FEED NO SNITCH
The DA think SHE SO SLICK, A conniving and EVIL CHICK
Talking about the RICO law INCREASE THOSE RISK
If papi throw'em I'm a KEEP THOSE BRICKS
And motherfuck the RICO law you outta suck my BICHO BITCH
Gold diggers they don't wanna give a G NO KISS
When you get money they ready to DRINK YO PISS
I lost one of them broads to some MENO TRICK
Heard he be taking her out on CASINO TRIPS
Get her hair done bout to cop a MENO WHIP
Every other day he give her about THREE FOUR CHIPS
I guess that's why she don't want to be with ME NO SHIT
All I gave her was hard dick and CHICO STICKS
I'll carry my own work if I don't SEE NO CHICK
There ain't a ass that could CHEEK ALL THIS
The real recognize the real when WE SAW KISS
Papoose get straight love from Jada like HE WILL SMITH</pre>
