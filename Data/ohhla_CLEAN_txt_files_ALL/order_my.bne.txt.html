[Krayzie]
Jeremiah 10: 23,24
"We will know oh Lord that to Earthly men his way does not belong
it does not belong to man who must walk even to direct his step
correct me oh Jehovah however with judgement not in anger
that you may not reduce us to nothing"

[Chorus]
Order my steps, lead me, guide me
everyday send your annointing father
I pray order my steps in the world

[Layzie]
Why am I payin' this price for fame now with the shame
I'm goin' blame cause I'm solo empty
When I can stop and give it all to Christ
cause in his name no weapon should be formed against me
simply know that the world gon' tempt me Satan is the enemy
God please help us I don't want to be selfish
I don't want to live my life tryin' to be rebellious

[Wish]
Who be checkin' when ya know ya doin' wrong huh?
Got your steps, give your blessings
Know right from wrong turn the lights on
all ya gotta do is follow faith till they call us all home
but its so hard temptation is everywhere
gotta hold my guard like oh my God

[Krayzie]
Halleujah, Halleujah, now I might not make it to Heaven
but I'm tryin' to come back in the resurrection change my place in paradise
so I pray to God try to change my life
but temptation make it hard for me to make it out
man I gotta cool out, still I need to stop smokin'
I need God's guidance without it I'm hopeless
Lord please help me stand strong

[Chorus]

[Layzie]
A lot of soldiers in the pin ain't ever comin' home
can you find it in your heart to pray
so it seems everything goin' wrong
and you're just tryin' to find your way
momma just wanna feed her babies
tryin' to keep a safe place to stay
don't stress it's a test God BLESS all ya
really gotta do is just keep your faith

[Wish]
You can feel it if you open up, you can get it if you need love
as much as a mustard seed is all you need
small person pays for the air that we breathe
and the baby is born, place to go when we leave
food that we eat, weapon when we sleep
it's a miracle no believin' the Lord

[Krayzie]
HEY!
What cha seein' on the news has already been written in the Bible
but ain't nobody takin' the time to realize that believin' and readin'
the scriptures could mean your survival and I don't wanna die no neva
I wanna live forever and I would a lot better
so when Armageddon really come true what chu gon' do?

[Chorus]

[Kray:] swing low [Lay:] God loves me
[Kray:] swing low [Lay:] ask me how I know
[Kray:] swing low [Lay:] God loves me, ask me how I know
[Kray:] swing low [Lay:] God loves me, ask me how I know
[Kray:] swing low, swing low I know cause the Bible tells me so

[Layzie]
You know God is good
you know God is great and everyday I wake
I gotta thank him for my life and even though its hard
I know I make mistakes I give it everything it takes just to make it right
this is Satan's land understand the plan yall Jesus
comin back with a furious mind better praise everyday
hurryin' doin' your job glory to the king that's my heavenly father</pre>
