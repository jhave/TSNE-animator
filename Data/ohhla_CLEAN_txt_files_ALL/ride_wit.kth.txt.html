[Keith Murray]
Yeah, ride with me, yeah!
Yeah! Ride with me
Roll ya down windows and ride with me
(All: Ride with us) Yeah!
Bitch (All: Ride with us) Yeah!
(All: Ride With us)
Roll up ya windows and (All: Ride with us)

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
Let's smoke this Oakland Indo don't roll down the window
Start the car we ain't going to far
You know that big booty girl you're always fucking wit?
She got a sister, I really want to get
Some Georgia girls, some College Park
You already fucked when we get to start it off
Park in a drive-way, it won't take long
Do it like that it goes, on and on
You know this the kind of the shit I know you want
E made the beat, let me show you something (Erick Sermon: Yeah)
Quite a few hate us, wanna see us play out
But we got the formula to get paid now (Erick Sermon: Word up)
You can't stand in the way of success
We got the same job but you make much less
I remember how it used to be (Erick Sermon: Like what?) before we had crack
If you had a few hundreds in your pocket that was fat

[Erick Sermon-Chorus]
If you feel like smoking then (All: Ride with us) (Redman: Yeah!)
Hop the train with no token (Bitch) (All: Ride with us) (Redman: Yeah!)
If ya don't give a fuck then (All: Ride with us)

[Keith Murray]
Roll ya windows down and (All: Ride with us)

[Erick Sermon]
If ya got +5 On It+ then (All: Ride With us) (Redman: Yeah!)
And if ya hate fake niggas then (All: Ride with us) (Redman: Yeah!)
And if ya cool pull triggers then (All: Ride with us)

[Redman]
Roll up ya windows and (All: Ride with us)

[Verse 2: Keith Murray]
Aiyyo, I lick two shots it's heard around the world
Check out our forty and a blunt can take a nigga girl (Take a nigga girl)
Like E ? don't say nothing I'm hunting (Redman: Word)
On the microphone, it's the eve of destruction (Redman: Yeah!)
As the world goes around like passion you get flat in a orderly fashion
You was warn like a coming detraction
I got playa hated, felt liberated
Put em on a burner cause nigga violated (Redman: Word! Word!)
We scamper like guide dogs through the fog
If ya feel like you wanna hop, leap like a frog (Like a frog!)
Like a Sergent General, get busy chief (Redman: Word up)
The fastast way to spell wrong relief is Keith! (Redman: Keith!)
I leave you ass'd out like a cocain droute
Aiyo, can I get a witness like Andre Crotch? (Redman: Crotch!)
Niggaz need to stop frontin, bitches need to stop stuntin (Redman: Word!)
Cause they know fuck well they can't stop my production

[Erick Sermon-Chorus]
If ya like smoking then (All: Ride with us) (Redman: Yeah!)
Hop the train with no token (All: Ride with us) (Redman: Yeah!)
If ya don't give a fuck then (All: Ride with us)

[Redman]
Roll ya windows down and (Too $hort: Beotch!) (All: Ride with us)

[Erick Sermon]
And If ya got +5 On It+ then (All: Ride With us)
And if ya hate fake niggas then (All: Ride with us)
And if ya cool pull triggers then (All: Ride with us)

[Redman]
Roll up ya windows and (All: Ride with us)

[Verse 3: Redman]
Aiyyo, I got the, forty acres without the fucking mule
Doc Ike Turner, giving mic's audio abuse (Erick Sermon: Word up)
I smack a big mouth bitch, and her baby sitter and her lesbian friend, and 
that nigga with her
I don't give a fuck I smack blood outta midget
My tactics make Evil D say "Come on, kick it!"
A black five with rims which could spot me in
When I die, I snatch you like Doc  Kervorkian
So turn the beat up while Narcs got me on sweep up (Uh-huh)
I'm lucky, I usually tote more guns than Peter (Ha-ha)
I'll fuck you up till where you forehead and cut meat up
You wanna box I +Square+ more than Madison Arena (Ding!)
Backstabbing bitches and niggas, EAT A DICK!
Plus, you never heard the Doc do nothing like this
Backstabbing bitches and niggas, EAT A DICK!
Plus, you never heard the Doc do nothing like this

[Erick Sermon-Chorus]
If ya like smoking then (All: Ride with us)
Hop the train with no token (Bitch) (All: Ride with us) (All: Yeah!)
If ya don't give a fuck then (All: Ride with us)

[All]
Roll ya windows down and ride with us

[Erick Sermon]
And If ya got +5 On It+ then (All: Ride With us) (Redman: Yeah!)
And if ya hate fake niggas then (All: Ride with us) (Redman: Yeah!)
And if ya cool pull triggers then (All: Ride with us)

[Redman]
Roll up ya windows and (All: Ride with us)

[Erick Sermon]
Come on ride with us, ride with us
Come on, ride with us, ride with us
Come on, ride with us, ride with us
Ride ride ride ride ride ride ride
Come on, then ride with us, ride with us
Come on, ride with us, ride ride</pre>
