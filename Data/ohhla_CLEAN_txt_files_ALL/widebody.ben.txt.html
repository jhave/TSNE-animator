[Intro - Benzino]
Oh you really think I wasn't comming back?
Man you got me all twisted, c'mon man
Beat Focus yeah
Yo ugly turn it up man
Zno, Sis Meazy, whatup
48, Alize, whatup
JB Jakes, 2 Times

[Hook - Faheim]
When I roll up low in that new wide body, please don't hate
Walk through the door, shorty look my way, it's ok
I ain't worried about, I'm here to party, here to party
See the ladies get low, get low, my hip kno! ws
Wrist glow it's a party, aiyo

[Verse 1 - Benzino]
Nevermind if my pants sag
Just as long as my earrings light up the skylight, bombs over Bahgdad
I hope you haters act fast
Cause I'm about to change my name from Benzino to Mad Cash
You know what I'm starin
I told my rims to stop spinnin, they ain't listen cause they hard of hearing
Tinted coupes, Christal, then you loose
Mama you rollin with a G, no more gin &amp; juice
Gangsters don't take it light
Any night, dime pieces, got em shaking like Vegas dice
See ID, VIP, Benz do everything B.I.G. *Baby*
Beantown what I do rep, weed from the dred, got me right for the two step
Ice on my wrist, glist flash, ring to em
Shorty's a done deal, go ahead homie sing to em

[Hook - Faheim]
When I roll up low in that new wide body, plea se don't hate
Walk through the door, shorty look my way, it's ok
I ain't worried about, I'm here to party, here to party
See the ladies get low, get low, my hip knows
Wrist glow it's a party, aiyo

[Verse 2 - Benzino]
I got Cris by the case, lil pocket full of pesos, you can come party with me
Me in the back, plays sittin on stacks, you can get the party started with me
Sticky ! icky in the air, run my fingers through your hair, all the time while I'm sizing you up
I can tell she's a freak, I ain't even gotta speak, fill it up to the top of a cup
One more a drink, I ain't gotta think, already know soon she'll be naked in a mink
Tryin' to make the world spin, diamonds and pearls when
She make the call to menage with her girlfriend
I can not lie, I love when pretty girls got their toes pointed at the sky
Sendin them, back home barely remember them
Four tim! es a week at least, that's the minimum

[Hook - Faheim]
When I roll up low in that new wide body, please don't hate
Walk through the door, shorty look my way, it's ok
I ain't worried about, I'm here to party, here to party
See the ladies get low, get low, my hip knows
Wrist glow it's a party, aiyo

[Bridge - Faheim]
How many ladies wanna party with us
Shake their bodies for us
Sip Bacardi with us
Leave in Ferrari's with us
How many ladies wanna party with us
Shake their bodies for us
Sip Bacardi with us
Leave the party aiyo

[Hook - Faheim]
When I roll up low in that new wide body, please don't hate
Walk through the door, shorty look my way, it's ok
I ain't worried about, I'm here to party, here to party
See the ladies get low, get low, my hip knows
Wrist glow it's a party, aiyo</pre>
