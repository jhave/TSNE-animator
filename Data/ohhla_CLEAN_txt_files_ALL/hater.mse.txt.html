Bitches is drop dead gorgeous yo
Wassup with Ma$e B?
Why he be showin no love this way B?
Come through the block don't say shit or nothin
Don't forget, he used to live on our block nigga
He went with Puffy &amp; he don't know how to act B
Wait till I get on B, it's gonna be real
Wait till I see that nigga on the street.
Nigga, gonna take me nowhere

Fuck, everybody don't make moves at the same time
It takes time B, everybody gotta get they chance to shine
Ya know what I'm sayin, everybody get they chance to shine</pre>
