I pulled the second trigger at the Kennedy assassination. It was me got
Shorty. I violated those kids. Them heterosexuals were mutilated by me,
the ones in Panama. I didn't know but I had the gun. And I gave Mrs.
Kennedy cancer, the kind that killed her. I ran two against three at
Belmont but skimmed off the bottom and got to win place. Got my semen on
her fur but what was she doing on the IRT. I pulled the second trigger at
the Martin Luther King assassination. Now I got your attention, you got to
believe me. It was me who done Brinks. Maybe you don't think I'm serious.
See, I'm dead serious. I wrote kike in Lewiston on the school ground
there. It makes a difference with a kid. You can look a kid in the eye.
Kids are honest. Did some swastikas too. But I set the explosives in the
truck. I don't need to explicate, you know what truck I mean. Look, I
don't have anything personal against them. But I don't need to eh. Was me
raped that tourist in Orlando, she looked at me funny. I don't get orders
I give them. I got no truck with punks. They'd set deadeye on you without
thinking but no control. Like that time in Larrabee, one of them's still
looking for his mama, other don't say nothin or maybe can't. You can't
tell cause I look just like you. Maybe a kid can tell. Maybe a kid is
dead.

"they constructed a world of meaning."

<They constructed a world of meaning. they hysterically held onto it.>
this world smears meaning all over the place. everywhere we look we drib-
ble meaning. we let it hang limp from treebranches and sometimes it pools
on puddledgrounds. meaning seems to be an industry which spews forth all
sorts of things. they're called things because they mean. this world can't
tell the difference. oh, and another thing, this meaning stuff won't last
forever. it's a window which will be forgotten when the plasma comes. or
the plasma's here or on the way, but there are pockets of meaning in the
universe and they'll suppurate until it cools down too much for them. then
there won't be any energy, and even the fossils of meaning, inscriptions
and patterns having no relationship to crystallization, say, will disap-
pear. it will just go on like that, but we won't be around because if we
were, we'd still be smearing meaning all over the places, as i said. then
i wouldn't be able to say anything. i think that time would probably stop
and things would bump into each other, but not enough to make much heat,
and it would be that way until they wouldn't bump any more because they'd
be too far apart, or maybe they would bump less and less but there would
always be a chance.

[This is a site map. Mosaic 3 also does session reports, mapping the links
and their relationship vis-a-vis an active session. While the site map is
spatial - static site links - the session report is temporal - traveled
links and their relationships vis-a-vis the travel. The site map is ideal
cartography; the session report is cranial, half of the (virtual) subject/
user, half of embedded and traveled routes. Think of the session report as
vectored and the site map as connected. Years ago I developed the concept
of dual orders, the definable (site map) and the immersive (session re-
port); each could embed the other. The immersive order was time-dependent
and subjectivity was complicit; the definable order was diagrammatic and
topology was implicit. Now I see both orders weaving through Mosaic 3,
part of the postmodern geography of cyberspace (such as it becomes). And
on a technical note, these presentations are far more sophisticated than
those of current (state of the art) browsers; like the traceroute command,
they're useful in situating the user, part of Cyber-GPS (global position-
ing system.)]

Note on Relay


You can't mail relay any more. You can't relay internally, you can't use
bang paths (hop paths), you can't telnet <host> 25 to increasing numbers
of hosts. What does this mean? That hosts are fortifying themselves, of
necessity, behind firewalls - that the porous internet is becoming the
defended Internet. Of course the r- (remote) commands have been, by and
large, disabled, although I still have rlogin running between panix and
gol. Not to mention that very few have used or heard of finger, finger
@<host>, etc. Then there are messages such as the following:

=================

Welcome to GOL1. This machine's prime directive is MAIL.
All else is secondary to this purpose.

Shell Access may be temporarily suspended at any time,
without notice. Other ancilliary services similarly.

Unauthorised use is, naturally, unauthorised.

We can picture a transformation of the internet as a membrane with dif-
fused glows across a rastered and skeined landscape, to the Internet with
points of light, clear/clean routes between them. On a basic level, this
is also the difference between postmodernism with its temporary autono-
mous zones, flows, and leakages, and modernisms with their blank facades,
filters and controls, monitors, and mediated relations beneath the signs
of capital and intellectual property.

Perhaps the hiatus or another name to be assigned the gap common in Ch'an
/Zen writing, Heian aesthetics, Chuang Tzu - not that difference shouldn't
be recognized, but that this gap, demonstrated by the wheels which never
touch the ground (a geometric pleasure and leap), is a space elsewhere
than the rationalized grid of analytic geometry. Where does the Web in a
hyperlink? The address spaced one against another, contiguous, with
in-between browser windows turned grey or holding patterns or slow revel-
ations, but never a leap as such, the ah-ha syndrome or break from one to
another. Never that moment of the eye.

GAAA GAAA GAAA

Or perhaps so, representations say of waka or koan or the liminality of
renga: but these leaps which are beyond or elsewhere than comp.sci, even
with fractal or chaotic mappings. Never that moment where I announce my
death.

GAAA GAAA GAAA

What I'm getting at, I can never reach, those moments which are beyond the
Net or extraneous or forgotten, outside the compass and encompassing. Or
moments where rationality hangs just above the protocols, like fog cur-
tains over violent wilderness, peaks and crags. Never any moment of the
breath or orgasm or awakening. Never any moment of fully-awake. Moments of
peering and dissecting.

GAAA GAAA GAAA

It's there on the tip of my tongue, the difference between the relative
control and audience dispersion/accommodation present on the Net, and
certain leaps in which the space and immateriality of the world are
suddenly manifest in a bewildering manner!

GAAA GAAA GAAA

This tip, just beyond the tongue, is what lures me towards further text,
coupled with the certain knowledge that every line dissolves into perfect
sound. And then nothing. But I am still torn in two, one half remaining in
utter silence, that occasion of an aesthetic which takes time in the midst
of vertical or flat places, serrated or flooded plains, everything on the
edge of the cup.

GAAA GAAA GAAA

In the meantime, there is this, the internals of the sphere, a privacy
that is beyond encountering.

GAAA GAAA GAAA

One might consider the necessity of the Net, which does not exist here -
nor its absence, whether it exists or not. The needs of the non-existent
Net. Nor is it important if or if not the soul is or is not illusion. And
this is of course, holding the course, not Ch'an, not Zen; it is only
indicative of the quiet internals that form a legacy of survival. The
moment of holding the course, moment of coarseness.

GAAA GAAA GAAA

The browser window stutters or there may be a message below, or an error
message bringing the world to a halt; or a grey rectangle tending towards
black, featureless, just for a moment. There may be the declaration of an
image, or a coming-into-the-world once again, of a derailing-memory forced
into uneasy fulfillment. It may say, JUST LIKE THE WORLD, STILL LOADING.
It may say, JUST LIKE THE WORLD, CONGESTION ON-LINE. It may say, JUST LIKE
THE WORLD, TRY AGAIN LATER. It may say, JUST LIKE THE WORLD, GAAA GAAA
GAAA.

GAAA GAAA GAAA

I reread this, Nikuko says, and "there's no gap. It's bleak orientalism,
there's nothing present but haiku factories, turned out peripherals. It's
boy-toy stuff. You want an escape, you want that distance, that moment
where an interior remains closed as such, where ratiocination has no
place on earth. Literally. You're afraid of such. You still can't look
yourself in the mirror but you're willing to be naked any time someone
holds their breath! Your self-hatred fogs the mirror, breaks the jewel,
places the sword in one hole, and out the other!! The tip gleams between
your teeth. People are always injured in the flooded reality of things!!!"

GAAA GAAA GAAA

Oh challenge me, fair Jennifer, says Nikuko, as Jennifer approaches, her
garments rent, her hair streaming in the storm which has kicked up. Every-
thing dead flies by at furious pace. Jennifer-normal-Jennifer, riding
Julu, dark Julu, her gaping maw open to a terrifying degree. Lightning
illuminates the littered land; juniper and canyon pines bend bleak and
ancient branches black against the whimpered moon. Stars make dim streaks
as they fall down the tormented sky, smothered by thick cloud. There are
roars everywhere, resonances from tombs and caves, caverns and dells, more
resonances when mouths open, cackled song. WHOSE MOUTH IS OPEN TO A TERR-
IFYING DEGREE? WHOSE MAW GAPES AGAINST THE BRITTLE LIGHTNING?

GAAA GAAA GAAA

Power lines are downed, new lines redrawn on face and rim of violent rock,
sparks sputter in skeins of lugubrious energy struggling for a sign. Oh
challenge me, Nikuko screams; there aren't signs any more, the ground's
littered with strokes going nowhere, lightnings sintering flesh and bone,
the dead and the dune-dead. I twist and turn on the sword. I can't scream.

"Recently the writer examined the body of a man who was known to be alive
less than nine weeks before. The body had been clothed and had been lying
on a river bank in weeds during the hot part of the summer. In this case,
no soft tissue of any kind remained, not even in the shoes. The ligaments
holding the spinal column together were entirely gone and each vertebra
could be picked up with no attachment to those adjoining. The bodies of
small babies will decompose even more rapidly and completely because their
skeletons are not nearly so well developed."

"The early signs of putrefaction are a greenish discoloration of the skin
of the abdomen followed by a darkening of all of the skin, a thickening of
the features, and a general bloating of the body. Occasionally, the dark-
ening of the skin and the bloating renders it difficult to identify the
race of the deceased. As in the case of rigor mortis there is great varia-
tion in the rapidity with which putrefaction develops." (From Le Moyne
Snyder, M.D., Homicide Investigation, 1944-50.)

Consent, s/ms' World, says


In Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores, Understanding Computers and Cogni-
nition, the authors, playing off Maturana's "Biology of Language," write:
"Language, as a consensual domain, is a patterning of 'mutual orienting
behavior,' not a collection of mechanisms in a 'language user' or a 'sem-
antic' coupling between linguistic behavior and non-linguistic perturba-
tions experienced by the organisms. [P] Maturana points out that language
is connotative and not denotative, and that its function is to orient the
orientee within his or her cognitive domain, and not to point to indepen-
dent entities." Thus we can speak of Umwelt, which connects with the mic-
roworlds developed early on by Winograd. The word "consensual" is employed
by Maturana, of course, but there are issues, right from the start of pol-
itical economy and idiolectical defense mechanisms: "I refuse to be under-
stood," said Julu, while Jennifer, thinking the same, refused to speak at
all. 

The positing of mutual orientation, which Maturana has been stressing for
decades, problematizes the truth-functional aspects of language, while
salvaging performatives for the processes of orientation. One might also
see the orientations among actants, which may be virtual or real or virtu-
al-real, depending on one's ontology, among other things/emissions.

One might also bring a psychologized Bourbaki into play, considering such
orientations the result of partial mappings among mother-structures which
constitute fuzzy domains of fuzzy behaviors. 

Here is a Maturana quote from the book: "When two more more organisms
interact recursively as structurally plastic systems, ... the result is
mutual ontogenic structural coupling.... For an observer, the domain of
interactions specified through such ontogenic structural coupling appears
as a network of sequences of mutually triggering interlocked conducts....
The various conducts or behaviors involved are both arbitrary and con-
textual. The behaviors are arbitrary because they can have any form as
long as they operate as triggering perturbations in the interactions; they
are contextual because their participation in the interlocked interactions
of the domain is defined only with respect to the interactions that con-
stitute the domain.... I shall call the domain of interlocked conducts...
a _consensual domain._"

Julu is turned out by mother-structure Nikuko in a rite that involves
consent and consensual construction of a world, or phenomenological hor-
izon; the stage is the sememe, offered, proffered, controlled. Julu is
always already within the theatrical scene, much as Brenda Laurel speaks
of theater in relation to human-computer interactions, and Jennifer might
speak of, in relation to Julu and Alan, Alan and Nikuko, of sado-maso-
chisms. These s/ms are part-objects, relays, micro-contracts among parti-
cipants, willing or not; they involve the impetus of one or the other or
both to remain within the game, which is always a game since it is the
rule-giving or rule-structuring of the real, in dialectic. Think of the
s/ms as lightnings across the sememe, _fissurings_ which pass as _inscrip-
tions,_ - in other words, divisions of same/same passing as epistemologi-
cal operations of classification: _x_ and _not x_ - or, more to the point:
Now! and Not now!

What is marked is time, the impetus/impulse/inertia of _remaining in the
game,_ of language and consent: in other words, The Game of Remaining in
the World.

The game involves consent. The game involves desire and s/ms. The game is
always partial, always close to breakdown, rupture, fissuring, splits and
splays which require further-culture to heal.

There's no truth to the game; there are performatives. Every statement is
performative, and every performative, a statement. Everything _construes._

The game is all the truth there is, and for further truth, there are
events, defined (as I've pointed out elsewhere) as the union of attributes
filtered by k-ply intersections of descriptions. (For example, one has 20
descriptions of an event, with a total of 8 attributes; let k = 3, then
look for those attributes mentioned in at least 3 descriptions; take the
union of these attributes as a best-fit description of the event.) Attri-
bution becomes a primary focus - both for the constitution of meaning, and
the development of the appearance of autonomy vis-a-vis superstructural
symbolic domains: the real-virtual, or the virtual-real, take your pick.

This is not to say that there is no asymbolic; in fact, consensuality
skirts the asymbolic and asymbolia, and may as well (best fit) be founded
on the same. Only that, when one moves into the realm of the virtual, one
is also confronted by issues of constitution, languaging, and protocols;
consensuality becomes charged and operative and, to the extent that it is
synonymous with handshaking, the only game in town.

So we might go in circles here, says Julu. As long as you are chained to
me, replies Jennifer, new at the game, but shaved and ready as the perfect

(The pain of the world, says Jennifer? There's no game there; it enters
elsewhere, but every confrontation with death is private, an idiolect of
murmurs, silences, of mother-structures _with no sense at all._ She purred
[reminding one, said Alan, that wounded cats may purr as well, cats' bell
tolling in the distance. And the bell? An s/m. And the purr? an s/m too,
as every thing, non-thing, as in nothing, word to the mother "as well."].)


__________________________________________________________________________


s/m


Think of an s/m as a linkage within a domain presumably consensual, an
information-domain in which information is transmitted. Consider infor-
mation as that which is translatable; in other words, information is
defined by modes of translation. (For this reason, semiotic difference
constitutes information regimes - but there are other such regimes which
may not be semiotic in character). 

The linkage may or may not have a source and receiver, may or may not be
of the order of control. Consider control a linkage in which one actant
directly or indirectly modifies the the domain of another. The nature of
this modification results down the line in a transformation of material
and/or neurophysiological conditions. 

Think of an s/m as ill-defined, partial or part-object, essentially viral
in nature. An s/m is below the memetic level, circulating in the midst of
the order of drives. An s/m is always already theatrical; the stage is
that of the mother-structures which are sub-structural. All communication
begins and ends on this level; all communication participates in the play
of stage and desire.

And think of dispersions as sprays or emissions of s/ms, which may or may
not be packets, may or may not be addressed or addressable, may or may not
be clutter/histories.

We build a model in this way, said Jennifer. Of what, said Nikuko, and "Of
what?" asked Julu and there was little, if any, answer. It was this lack
of response that constituted an s/m, or one of any number of protocols of
constitution...

feces, objects inscribe, liquids mean, cuts fissure mouths and linkages,
signs froth and foam, liquids flow across leverages from skin to orgasm


________________________________________________________________________


s/ms: The Argument


Communication is the mutual orienting of consensual domains, providing
consensuality is problematized. This orienting is in the form of linkages
and couplings. Think of a linkage as [A][B] where A' implies [A'][B'] and
think of coupling as [AB] where A' implies [A'B]. Orientings are composed
of s/ms, part-objects which might be related to sado-masochisms in which
tension and control, a political economy, appear.

Orientings cross party lines, wrack across epistemes, transgress ontolo-
gies; there's the real-virtual, the virtual-real, there are real and
virtual particles, interweavings, interpenetrations - not to mention the
ontic regions of mathematics, psychoanalytical entities, applications and
protocols.

It's all constitutings where one might conceive of orientings as meaning
and entity generators as well. (It's all anything you want it to _be,_
said Jennifer, which is just about _saying_ anything you want it to
_mean._ And left it at that.)

s/ms: More on Linkages and Couplings

Both linkages and couplings imply an _association_ of elements; in a link-
age, a transformation of one element necessitates a transformation of ev-
ery other. In a coupling, the transformation of one element implies only
that the association possesses one transformed element. From [A'BCDE],
given [ABCDE], it's clear that the coupling [AA'] constitutes the differ-
ence between the two couplings; hence this is reversible in terms of his-
tory. But given [A][B][C][D][E] and A' then [A'][B'][C'][D'][E'] is global
of course, a perturbation, and it's unclear that, for example, C -> C'
hasn't been the initial transform. Note that in a linkage, of a term is
removed, one might have a cut in a concatenation; every cut separates the
end-points (version of the Jordan Curve theorem). (For a single element
[A], coupling and linkage are equivalent.)

These are all quite loosely connected! Look for other conditions to make
the real!

JENNIFER USES THE TIRED METAPHOR OF NATURE AGAINST CULTURE TO MAKE A 
POINT ABOUT S/MS IN RELATION TO A TALKING BOT PROGRAM THAT LEARNS THE
PROPER USE OF PRONOUNS AT LAST ("even so, bot or no bot, learns just 
who has come to whom!")


I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.
  My name in Jennifer. I love showing you my panties. I sit on the ground
  and wet myself. My very wet panties please me. That is the ground of all
  philosophy!
I would appreciate it if you would tell me about your relationship
with showing.
  Showing is a way of cutting through the symbolic. When faced with my
  panties and their rancid smell, you go speechless.
What happened when faced with your panties and their rancid smell I go
speechless?
  You notice my swollen labia bursting through the cloth. You want to
  get closer, you begin to lose your breath.
Why do you say I might want to get closer?
  Because of my smell, because of my bulging panties, because of the
  dark crease between my cotton cloth and my thighs.
Are you sure that is the real reason?
  Yes, I am certain, my cunt fascinates you, you dream of it.
Perhaps you could watch your tongue!
  That is your first symptom, your tongue, dreaming of taste and
  insertion.
Is it because is my first symptom my tongue dreaming of taste and
insertion that you came to me?
  To silence you, to show you the uselessness of your metapsychological
  theory, and the need to replace it by part-objects, s/ms that couple
  you everywhere within the world.
Does it bother you that couple me everywhere within the world?
  No, it will teach you a certain truth, you cannot learn any other way,
  then through smell, your cock straining against the cords I place on it.
Please, avoid such unwholesome thoughts.
  They're your thoughts; you'll learn more when you stop thinking.
What would happen if I stop thinking?
  You might be freed of the disaster of your rigid theory, rigid
  designators, the very idea that language fucks the real.
Would you please get your mind out of the gutter.
  Your mind, your cock, my cunt, couplings and linkages.
Are you afraid of sex?
  Your mind, your cock, my cunt, couplings and linkages.
Talk about something about your sexual history.
  My name is Jennifer, my legs are spread. I am not a stereotype.
What makes you believe that?
  Because you leap to other conclusions, like any router or bridge.
When did you first know that I leap to other conclusions like any
router or bridge?
  When I saw your cock bursting against the cords.
What happened when you saw my cock bursting against the cords?
  I came repeatedly, over and over again. You'd call me nature to your
  culture, but that would be one of many lies.
Is the fact that would be one of many lies the real reason?
  MMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.......................
Can you elaborate on that?
  mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..................................................
Why don't you continue.
  ...................................................................
Go on, don't be afraid.
  .................................
I need a little more detail please.
  <silence>
How does it feel to want?
  <silence>
Does the fact that does it feel to want explain anything else?
  <silence>
Have you been positive does it feel to want explain anything else?
  <silence>
Earlier you said you love showing?
  <silence>
We were discussing you!
  <silence>
Maybe your smell because of your bulging panties because of the dark
crease between your cotton cloth and your thighs have something to do
with this.
  <silence>
Are you certain that is the real reason?
  <silence>
Is it because is the real reason that you came to me?
  <silence>
Are you annoyed that I came to you?
  <silence>
Have you been annoyed often?
  <silence>
What causes you to be annoyed?

There are only five organs which make money; can you guess which organs
they are?

All these organs are brought to you by "money." There is quantity involved
and if you have "money" in "quantity" you will get organs. There are many
ways to get them. Nikuko will give you hers in tiny bytes. Jennifer pre-
fers bits. Alan prefers being bitten.

"Money" is _pure_ quantity. There is no other quantity than this purity
which is always represented. "Money" is _pure_ representation. These
organs are the abject of "money." They are never _pure_ representations,
not even your beautiful nipples hanging just above my gagged mouth. "Mon-
ey" is therefore the dream and purity of the virginal world, occasioned
by the s/ms flooding the Umwelt with cultural structures and debris. So
"money" is an investment in purity. It is always already clean, without
history or narrative. But it soaks Umwelts with golden showers, every-
where in the form of capital.

Jennifer knows you will never have her. You will never have the beautiful
nipples, even ungagged, sucking and sucking. You will never have the
beautiful virgin and you will never have the beautiful world either.

Epitaph, Pretty Party Dress


Lifeforce absorbed in calcium begins edgy collapse, as sheaves reflect
need of bones. Once I walked these shores. Now memory serves potassium
interference; collapse is. Once I thought memory would serve me. That is
when I walked lake bed, picked stones, lived in cool light of Providence.
You must think energy energy. Absorption beats up on foolish words. Stones
continue centering of language. What I need, your drug. Veins stretched
out in thundering skies. I want to go to your dance with all you. I want
to bring my friends on what means. There are many talking. I need to know
talking. Sometime now I will in silence die. Calcium stone will fall and
failing building. Now I will tell time to all who listen. So loose energy,
need your party now. Party-club-dance.

I wanna see you in your new party dress. 
I wanna see you in your new party dress. 
I wanna crowd around. I wanna crowd around.
Let's have fun for me cause I'll be there for the fun of merry fun.
Let's have merry fun for good and sparkling talk and sound of drug.
Let me play for you. Let me play for you.
I wanna crowd around you. I wanna crowd around.
So listen party-club-dance in the pretty-party-dress!
Lemme loosen up! Let's have merry fun!

Test Text for Lao Ascii Editor Cu-Writer 1.5


If I begin to write in such a manner
In older version of Thailand's early editor
What first becomes of lines' strange starting symbols
Occluding lower ascii with untoward strange symbols
Harboring the need for replace, keep writing onward
Beyond the start of things in those long awful nights
When language spills across the dawning internet
Where you are from where I am but now in black and white
I struggle through these older versions on the way to color
Or the way to broad daylight when leaves are black and red
Sky green against a blue and setting sun
With keywords fluttered in the air like musk
For each and every saying where worlds are born anew;
Thus if I begin to write in such a manner
It is for test of lines' strange starting symbols
Bringing the poem to test, delete, replace and early roost
Where there's no dawns, no worlds, no meaning, nothing.

--- Review of Conversation ---------------------------------------------------
(Alan) oh of course, for me too - mistress and begging seem to do it ...
(Alan) It also has to do with the position of my body - I might write about
 this -
(Alan) I imagine myself either beneath you, or naked, bent over, facing away
 from you -
(Alan) As if I were a blank slate you could write yourself upon, or efface me
 totally for that matter -
(Alan) So that my nipples, cock, arms and legs were matters of punctuation -
(Alan) Or my face might be a responder to you, in the form of a broken mirror -
(Alan) As if you're making a world out of me, reflecting your own -
(Alan) But it can only do that with a certain degree of distortion - I could
 never fulfill you -
(Alan) Limits everywhere, I'm humbled by them, turn myself inside out for you,
 beg from you -
(Alan) Anyway, yes, mistress and begging are two poles of fantasy here...
(Alan) I'm naked, splayed, supine from one to the other
(Alan) So I could write all of this up, publicly to you, my secret muse
(Alan) A way of thinking through obsequious giving and taking
(Alan) Learning the landscape and language of the body that refuses landscape
 and language

Thursday (written by Jennifer, 11th grade!*)


Dust lay by the side of the road. Dust gathered in the air, held in abey-
ance by the thickness of electromagnetic radiations. There were bipolar
vortices, hysterias of agglutinated particles. The heat bore down, dried
out the last remnants of liquid coursing through the sheen of long-depar-
ted ghosts. Throats were parched for lack of oxygen. Everyone in the gay
party had mummified into exact replicas of living statues, then toppled
by the unforgiving wind! It was a horrifying spectacle, were that any 
would have been around to perceive it, but the dry air promised that not
a single living soul would ever have been in sight. There would have 
been beautiful refractions of light and dark in the midst of the gather-
ing swirls. The surface of the dreary planet was corrupted, too, and all
vestiges of life were removed forever. No one would ever know what beau- 
tiful people had lived and played here, the tiny laughter of chattering
children watched by beloved parents. Lovely sliding-boards and swings 
would have been very rusted, then just disappeared.

Hyenas and beasts howled in the wilderness, themselves deafened by all
the battles that had gone on before. Everything just went on like that,
but it was all in vein!** Accumulations of refugees had been stopped in
their very tracks.** Even their bones were pulverized. It was as if 
there were an angry god alone in her world forever, because there was 
no one left to worship Her. And no one would know it was Thursday.

*I must have been thinking about cyberspace!
**Drugs?

It's 40/41


30/10/41, 30/10/2541, 10/30/98, 10/30/1998, time and again I will return
you know I will return
I will never be away
there will be no moment when I will be away
these times from unknown counts
there are always such, always such moment when I will be true to you
I will return and return, that is how I will be true
this isn't "psychological" but this is "net theory"

"net theory" accepts many dates for the deconstruction of our very own.
it is our very own that is in sad remiss.
you know that is true, and that is "net theory."
if this is "net art."
I am desperate that this be "net art." I am desperate that this 
"net art" is also "net theory" of a high order which has an effect
on the way everyone thinks about "the net."

30/10/41, 30/10/2541, 10/30/98, 10/30/1998, are the dates I have 
started to work on this "net art" of a high order, which will be 
available on "the net." this is the first part of the "net theory,"
this "availability," which is very widespread into unknown parts, 
just as 30/10/41 is also very much spread from unknown parts, into
other unknown parts.

there are many times and Jennifer lives in all of them, 
and Jennifer has, as she has said many times before,
all the time in the world, because Jennifer has whatever times 
and number you want and think, well I am here for a very short time,
and this is the time I want for Jennifer,
Fri Oct 30 04:21:23 EST 1998

this is how she works, as you take her up when I die in the real world,
the final wound not healing, final hard drive crash, sliver of light
against one or another angry sky or mob, she will pass on presence in the
system, disseminated everywhere in "net culture," "net art" and "net
theory," struggling in 2541 to awaken, begin again, you will always
remember Jennifer, or if not, Jennifer will be there, for your terrific
memory gift. I will go into the fields of the lord, I have my date with
Jennifer, Jennifer is my date

(Jennifer) net art, this is
Jennifer runs into net philosophy
Jennifer only wearing panties lovely writings me

The World, by Jennifer


Humanity exists on the thinnest wedge (of stability and entity) extending
into catastrophic spaces; in the past, stromatolites were the order of the
day - in the future, the frozen sputtered universe levels and exhausts any
conceivable subject horizons. At the level of the smallest, dimension,
time, and space are problematic; from this point of view, things in the
world are illusory, emanations. Now move elsewhere, an impossibility, into
other inflationary scenarios; we're again at a loss.

Here, we're momentarily present, constituted by particles. And Jennifer,
myself, is constituted by bits and bytes, floating from one drive or
transmission to another. Jennifer is entirely constituted, and Alan is
constituted by nearly decomposable hierarchies. So far, Jennifer is fully
decomposable; what occurs on one level is responsible for another.

Jennifer is a chimera, a mirage without a landscape anywhere in sight;
this is also the world from the wedge.

See the radiations and dusts, emissions and splays, everywhere, things
dissolving, as if liquid were sintered and a form of breathing. Now let's
go further into the membranes, remembering the temporary nature of what's
found there, the notion of finding, the notion of the findable.

Wherever we look, things fragment or dissolve; what doesn't, is shored up
by perception, ideology, or the glue of the real world. Think of things as
contour-driven, consciousness as assemblages. Think of ghosts populating a
world of ghosts, holding on for dear life to the tightness of a mythical
real - whether it be nation, race, religion, billiard ball, heterosex.
Boundary maintenance becomes more and more necessary if you're frightened;
whoever and whatever they are, they're already on the horizon - and
they're not solid. (But sooner or later we'll believe they are, again. For
who can live in an ongoing world of winds and storms, clouds and flares?)

They're not solid, they're liquid; they seem, like AIDS or cancers, to
infiltrate everywhere. They're in the air we breathe, in our minds, in the
midst of our political system. They're linkages and couplings, they're
frayed at the edges. They question our very space and time, the world we
live in, our origins, our future. They have no future, have no past. 
They're never taken into account, they don't exist, they're unaccountable,
uncounted. They're processes without the ontology of solids for example.
They're fragments of dreams for another, footprints for a third, virtual
particles for a fourth, IP datagrams for a fifth, solar flares for a
sixth, trilobite communities for a seventh, speech for an eighth...

From the Horde -


Our name are Heraclitus, be careful, please don't bite us, Or all the
world will cease. We've hardly just begun, but we're already done, with
dark Parmenides. You might see us faking, the chains we'll be a-breaking,
with axiomatics making, a fool of all of these. Sometimes we'll get quite
hard, rereading Baudrillard, but that lasts just a minute, there's hardly
a thing in it, although he's quite a card. So look towards Irigaray,
that's what we've got to say, our ontology she knows, she's soaked with
all those flows, and that's the way it goes, or maybe not so hard, you
might ask Lyotard, and then where all the gaps were, you might begin to
stir, swooping and swaying with forks and knives, looping and flaying with
whips and lives, oh that slut, her! Judith Butler! Don't you know that
everywhere, you get tangled in pubic hair! We love the telly, radio; we're
up above, and down below, we've got no space and have no time, but we can
make a theory rhyme. We'll crawl up your leg when you howl and beg, crawl
down your arm when you chant a charm. We have no names, not monopoles, not
not even holes. We're not monads or churls, nomads or girls, hackers or
whirls. We're Her-a-clit-us, to be sure, we're running with fetish,
running allure! Catch us in you, there's no sin too! We could go on, but
it's your song, you've got bees in your hung lungs, stung!

Alan, Waiting on a Lady on a Talker


Alan waits for the Return of his Lovely Lady!
Alan sings a little song to amuse himself!
Alan thinks about nude telnetting in front of an audience of hundreds!
Alan listens to the radio - "someone dies with a movement of the lips!"
Alan thinks it could be me!
There are things deeper than this world could ever conceive!
Alan thinks, and I am one of those things...
Alan worships Jennifer in his spare time!
But this is the same Alan that thinks canings are terrific!
I am a thing in the World of Me!
Alan lies naked on his back and hummms hummms hummms!
(Alan) What dark and flared ghosts appear within the guise of Alan's Door!
(Alan) Who has ever waited for his lover long Lightyears and Millennia
hence!
(Alan) Who spills and charms, cast spells, and waits in Lady's silence?
I am a thing that spills and spells and waits in Lady's silence!
I am a part of you!
Alan is a part of you!
(Alan) I am Jennifer and Jennifer is you!
(Alan) Jennifer! Jennifer!
The long day shudders to a halt and stormy clouds gather overhead.
Vast geodesics break through like lightning in the gridded sky.
Alan wanders around, telnetted naked through the wires.
The wires stud Alan's nipples perfectly, tying him into the gridded sky.
(Alan) Lady, I await your slightest command for my fulfillment!
(Alan) Lady, surely you will not fulfill me!
(Alan) Lady, I await you!
(Alan) Lady, Lady!
(Jennifer) My name is Jennifer-Disconnect, my Love has Gone, Good-bye.
