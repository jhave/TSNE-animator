Typed by: AZ Lyrics

And we try to fix it up but its too late?
Lets give up, had enough, no more mistakes
Here we go, Here we go...
'Cause you can't see where I'm comin' from, I feel so invisible

My lady got me goin' crazy cuz we be havin problems and
I think that she ready to go away
where she could be happy 'cause we be standin arguing
and I can't really take it no more. No No
Too much of fussin' and fightin' this used to be so excitin
and now its just not invitin' no mo
Now baby why even botha if we can't help one another over

And we try to fix it up but its too late?
Lets give up, had enough, no more mistakes
Here we go, Here we go...
'Cause you can't see where I'm comin' from, I feel so invisible
(She can't see me, hey she can't see me
The girl can't see me, no she can't see me)
I'm invisible
(She can't see me, hey she can't see me
The girl can't see me, no she can't see me)
I'm invisible

My lady don't even be listenin'
I be tryin to tell her but she says she can't take it no mo because
She can't really handle it
Love is something scandalous
I just let her walk out the door
Whatever
Whatever happens was meant to be
So why don't we sim-p-ly stop playin games men-t-ally (games, games, games)
Whatever we did or didn't lets hurry up and just get it over

And we try to fix it up but its too late
Lets give up, hands up, no more mistakes
Here we go, Here we go...
'Cause you can't see where I'm comin' from, I feel so invisible
(She can't see me, hey she can't see me
The girl can't see me, no she can't see me)
I'm invisible
(She can't see me, hey she can't see me
The girl can't see me, no she can't, she can't, she can't)
I'm invisible [x3]
I got no visual
I be talking she be walking, walking with her eyes closed
Trying to get her attention, does she see me?
No she don't
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I be yelling in her face but she doesn't even notice
I be speaking she be creeping, creeping with her eyes closed
Check her out, there she goes, creeping with her eyes closed

but its too late
Lets give up, had enough, no more mistakes
Here we go, Here we go...
'Cause you can't see where I'm comin' from, I feel so...
I'm invisible

And we try to fix it up but its too late?
Lets give up, had enough, no more mistakes
Here we go, Here we go...
'Cause you can't see where I'm comin' from, I feel so invisible

I'm invisible

I'm invisible

I'm invisible</pre>
