Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x2]
All my niggas based to the end and me man
It's money over suckas, bitch roll this weed
Yes, light it up

All my niggas based that's the end of discussion
I'm a stay based for life, don't ask me bout nothing
You know what I repp, you know how I came
Frist time I came in the game, it was simple and plain
Staying based till I die, I keep lighting the flame
Got a legendary name, based God,
Based God, thank you based God, for what you did the whole job
The whole world, you done changed the game, no pressure
I was sitting at the top, the whole game was stressin
Like hour be, lil be gonn change the weather
You thought that he was broke, but he came for cedar
I never been a rap, but I came for cedar
Never be a better day when we step together
Bitch I stay based for life all day and night
Never be a fighting day's world, I stay real with my based girls

[Chorus: x2]
All my niggas based to the end and me man
It's money over suckas, bitch roll this weed
Yes, light it up

Can you say I'm based, I'm based, I'm based
It's real talk, how I feel to be based
Coming straight out the park, coming straight out the game
I'm a give time to meet, please don't be late
I'm a ride in my car with my woodpeg...
Putting smoke in the air, I'm dope as air
Same way you live twice like a ghost in there
When lil b walk through, that's your host this year
Everybody take a seat, take a toast in here
Welcome to based where we all based this year
Obviously, you based if you made it here
Don't play it hate, I'm base of spades
I look right at lil b, he looks like a lake
At night time, with a little sunshine
And lil b with he great, thank got I'm based
I said thank God I'm based

[Chorus: x2]
All my niggas based to the end and me man
It's money over suckas, bitch roll this weed
Yes, light it up</pre>
