Song:   Let's Go Get Stoned
Typed by: sensative_new_age_guy@hotmail.com

[Chorus]
"Let's go get stoned" 
Everybody if you feel like smokin get up and say 
"Let's go get stoned" 
From the front to the back grab a sack roll it up and say 
"Let's go get stoned"
I got five on it if you really wanna buy chronic, match me and 
"Let's go get stoned" 
Everybody if you feel like smoking that 

[Verse 1]
Mean, green, shit that make you feel like you livin inside a dream 
It seems I can never smoke without ashin up on my jeans
As a teen, now I'm clean, in the spring, winter and everything in between 
With a bottle of visine in my pants pocket, can't stop it 
Never been the type to smoke and do a little trash talkin
But I've been known to smoke and drive all over the damn tropics
Cop another dime, spark it while I drive, foggin up my ride
Stoppin at the light just to get a shotgun from the side
I wanna get high, if you do too, say 

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Chokealot, day that make you wanna choke a lot
Put it inside a bowl or cup a couple of dutches 
Smoke too much of it and you'll probably see poke-a-dots 
And I hope to god, that if you smoke some pot, you never try to approach a cop 
Unless you know, that, you can keep your cool
Jitterbugs probably think it's cool, 'til you see them fall asleep in school
Bleachers too, teachers knew, I was lifted 'cause my seat was glued
to me 'cause I didn't think I could move, desk covered with ink and drool 
Damn I need to eat some food, hamburgler, I forgot what I was saying earlier 
Damn I'm lit, man I'm sick, I can't even understand this shit
Pass the spliff, yo I'm laughin so much that my motherfuckin pants just ripped 
I dont know about you but if you ask me that's some pretty good cannibus

[Chorus]</pre>
