{*children screaming*}
{*bell rings*}

[Man over P.A. system]
I need your attention now kids
Due to the recent events that have occured
Effective immediately, all classes are suspended
Until further notice

{*children cheering*}

[Remedy]
Black and white notebooks and ball-point pens
The first day of school, might make some new friends
From the 103, dreams to me was a Benz
Or the 3 o'clock bell that sounds when school ends
Lunch room status, we used to roll dice
Bang beats on the tables to see who was nice
Swore we knew it all, didn't want no advice
How unfortunate, some paid the ultimate price
We used to cut class all day, roam around the hallways
With little wooden passes
I remember 6th grade, assembly, shirt with tie
The young little Remedy, wonderin why
I did what I was told to get to junior high
Cuz at that point in time I believed I could fly
Big blue binders, young designer finders
Livin in the world with no rules, high school
Language arts, I sat and wrote darts
My mind ran wild and free like +Young Hearts+
Mathematics, where I based my foundation
Fall to the nation on wack Education

[Chorus: Children of the World (Remedy)]
We don't need no Education
We don't need no thought control
(What we need?)
What we need is information
Teach us, leave those kids alone

[RZA]
Yo, yo, sit in the back of the class with my hand up
2 wild security guards just grabbed my man up (HEY!)
Threw him in detention for 5 days suspension
Cuz sunset, the teacher was lyin about the Indians
Tryin to tell much of the story of Columbus
Tryin to brain-numb us, when all you see, that came from us
They copy-carvin, I learned about Gods and
Taggin Wu logos on the corner in my book margin
Phat shoe laces and tri-colored sneakers
I stood up like a man then I questioned the teacher
"How did Europeans black out in dark ages?
And when it got light did they white-wash the pages?
Why is it average college kids stuck with low wages?
You wonder why these students walk around with 12 gauges?"
Intense like a New York riot, she stood quiet
And said, "Mr. Diggs, may I please speak to you in private?"

[Chorus]

[Remedy]
"Put away your things, pop quiz"
Yo who he thing he is though messin with them kids?
All he ever did in my 9 to 3 bid yo
We don't really need no, won't you let us live
Misinformation straight from the board of education
Percential government issue number 2 pencils
Scantron sheets, gettin mark incompletes
Yo, "Keep still", "Get up on the wall", "Fire drill"
Routine line-up, snitch how you do us
Try and fool us with the big yellow school bus
But nonsense, parent/teacher conference
The system's invincible, go see the principal

[Chorus]

[Remedy (Children of the World)]
Put a freeze on the nation, board of Education
(Hey teachers! Leave those kids alone!)
Try and fool us with the big yellow school bus
(All in all we're just another brick in the wall)
Diploma or not, got to use what you got
(All in all we're just another brick in the wall)
Even if you drop out, there is no cop out
(All in all we're just another brick in the wall)
Bunch of preachers, so-called teachers

[Chorus]

[Outro: Children of the World]
Hey teachers! Leave those kids alone!</pre>
