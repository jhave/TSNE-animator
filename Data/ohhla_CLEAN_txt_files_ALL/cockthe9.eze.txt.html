(Eazy-E)
Here's the latest
from the king of badness
I got the shit that makes niggaz wanna flip
G'd up all better wit beanies
Sweatin all the bitches to blow are weanies
Niggaz all getting drunk, and smoking a bum bud
Oh wait here's a punk, pump the trunk
Cuz it's a gang of jackers in the front smoking
all the hump, some shit was said about blue and red
but I'm colour blind and I gotta nine
threw up the sign I cock the 9, I cock the 9.

(Loco S.A.B)
Well nigga pop the 9and let it holla
Test drive wit a neighbourhood's scholar
Black Impaler, blue chucks on gettin outta
Sucks on hip hop thugsta get the fuck on
Niggaz looking shifty, do they wanna diss me, lick me
Show me love or peel my cap quickly
My six sense won't let me slip don't puff wit the draggin em
I'm still toe taggin em, hit the spot wit a don still baggin em
It's the low call, S.A.B on the vocal, blast my way out eazy pay
The way, all you bitch niggaz stay out

(Hook) x2

I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 ( and everything is fine)
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (my homey pop the 9)
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (*gun shot*)
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (my homey pop the 9)

(Phalos Mode)
It's like dice game, dice game niggaz get they roll'on
Everything's all good till niggaz getting sold on
Here we all get together and shoot, fuck
I grab my gun then I picked up my loot
But I didn't lose shit so it's all good
Leavin pumpin Eazy-E "Boyz n the Hood"
Cuz I'm a gangsta so I can relate, most of these
Niggaz is fake and tryin to hate
I put a buster in his place, I put one in his face
Obey my first and give him the taste
That's how I duz it, that's how I do it
and the murder weapon that I use you know I threw it
he kept persuading so I had to do it, 'uh' play
for keeps that's the rule of the streets 'uh'.

(Loco S.A.B)
Dick Tracy all on my nuttz like Cagny and Lacy
And don't faze me, Ruthless is the label that pays me
But this one H.K weighs a ton, words are yellow wit
the ??? freaks on a run, bring ya condom in the kingdom
huh ho from the ceilin to the floor, info red at ya window
plus the E go hangin out the beamer tho
drop shit like a seagull, for the people
ho's make a contribution, but y'all don't hear me tho.

(Hook) x2

(Eazy-E)
Tuck ya legs to my dick with the wrap em real tight
Just incase its on and a nigga gotta fight, an a
Nigga gotta bust, but who in the fuck said in god we trust
The shit wen't down everybody start runnin
Bitches screamin and the bullets still comin
Run into a nigga tryin to save mine, reach for my gun ahh shit!!
