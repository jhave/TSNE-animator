[Chorus]

Can you feel it in your body-ah (can you feel it)
Can you feel it in your body-ah (can you feel it)
Cause I can feel it in my body-ah (I can feel it)
It feels good to my body-ah
To my body, in my body-ah (can you feel it)
Can you feel it in your body-ah (can you feel it)
Cause I can feel it in my body-ah (I can feel it)
It feels good to my body-ah

We gonna make y'all feel it
Make y'all feel it
Make y'all wanna jam
Fellas in the place just clap your hands
Ladies in the house just grab a man
We gonna make y'all feel it
Make y'all feel it
Make y'all wanna move
Ladies in the place just show 'em proof
Fellas in the house you know what to do

We gonna make y'all feel it in a special way
A new van full of action and exposé
Ladies in the club looking ready to play
And I'm waiting for the right one to pass my way
And in the mean time I'm about to roll up The Hague
We got drinks on the table, tied up our lay
And it's time to unwind if you've had a low day
And ladies, I got something to say

[Chorus]

We gonna make y'all feel it
Make y'all feel it
Make y'all wanna jam
Fellas in the place just clap your hands
Ladies in the house just grab a man
We gonna make y'all feel it
Make y'all feel it
Make y'all wanna move
Ladies in the place just show 'em proof
Fellas in the house you know what to do

Feel the vibration of the bass charm
Put your face on the speaker, get your face blown
Get up on the floor, get your dance on
Cause your backbone's connected to your ass, go on
The ladies all dressed up high fashion (hot!)
Dancing all sexy with passion
Honey, if you don't mind me asking
Can you feel all that bass in that ass, hun?

[Chorus]

This is it (this is it) gotta keep 'em moving
Don't stop (don't stop) once you get moving
Don't break (one break) next thing you know
You on top (you on top) so hop to the rhythm
That we stop (don't stop) get loose and express
What you got (what you got) at least you gotta
Give yourself a shot (a shot) hey never get 'em up
And what you got?

Can you feel the hy-y-y-ype?
I can feel the hy-y-y-ype
Can you feel the hy-y-y-ype?
I can feel the hy-y-y-ype

[Chorus]

To my body, to my body-ah
To my body, to my body-ah</pre>
