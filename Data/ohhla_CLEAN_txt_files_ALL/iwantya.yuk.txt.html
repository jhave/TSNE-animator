(Yukmouth talking with Aaron Hall singing in backgroud)
Oh boy, Uh, Yea, Uh
I see some fly ladies in the house tonight
Uh, Yea, Me and my nigga A. Hall in this bitch
Hey my nigga we do the video we goin' straight to Brazil my nigga
Believe it

[Verse 1]
(Yukmouth)
You can tell its the summer
Girls in the Hummer
And the new Porsche, Boss Ballers, Tycoons
Swimming pool, Hoop course, Golf course
Miami beach house, Off shore
Hardcore, Sophmore, This album I floss more
Pull up in the Bentley Azure, Just me and A. Hall
Kidnap ya broad, Make her go awol
Real nasty broad who could swallow a eightball
Make a classy broad and model say I hate y'all
Or maybe because I date y'all, shake y'all
Replace y'all with a Daytona spring break broad
Real ballers pop Cris by the case dogg
Haters drink eggnog, Recognize like Nate Dogg
Shake Shake, Move ya body like a snake ma
Every night a hundred g's in ya face ma
Please believe me, Yuk and A. Hezzy
Get it crunk fa sheezy, Slut take it easy
Yea

[Chorus]
(Aaron Hall)
I gotta have ya body
Gotta have ya body
On and on and on an it go like
Anyway you want me to get you away
Your wish is my command, Baby
I gotta have ya body
Gotta have ya body
On and on and on an it go like
Anyway you want me to get you away
Your wish is my command, Baby

[Verse 2]
(Yukmouth and Aaron Hall)
We drinkin' Remy Martin, Mixed with Hypnotiq
All my alcholics, Incredible Hulk it
(Yukmouth)
I live it, I walk it, Talk it
Bad bitch in the cockpit of the Aston Martin
We got this, Hot chick with a body like a hourglass
Pokin' out the Frankie B. jeans, Matchin' Prada bag
I like girls with alot a ass
Long hair, Lotta class, She like dudes with alot a cash
Tiffany braclet, Mack makeup
I got the Raider throwback to match the black Jacob
Black fitted hat to match the Black Raider
The batch of playas, Snatch ya batch (bitch), Scratch ya Gator's
And leave with ya wifey of course
She of course never seen Gucci seats in a Porsche
And she got a hubby, But to me she divorced
Let my nigga Aaron sing the chorus
Bring it back, C'mon nigga

[Chorus]
(Aaron Hall)
I gotta have ya body
Gotta have ya body
On and on and on an it go like
Anyway you want me to get you away
Your wish is my command, Baby
I gotta have ya body
Gotta have ya body
On and on and on an it go like
Anyway you want me to get you away
Your wish is my command, Baby

[Verse 3]
(Aaron Hall)
We drinkin' Hypnotiq, Magnums in my pocket
Me and my man Yuk layin' low, You know we gotta rock it
From the US to Rio de Janerio
Layin' on the sand smokin' on some hydro
With the baddest hotties I's ever seen
Booty look good in the stylin' jeans
I don't care what nationality
Your wish is my command baby
I gotta have ya body
Yeaaa, Your wish is my command baby
I gotta have ya body
Heyyy, Your wish is my command baby

[Chorus repeats until song ends]</pre>
