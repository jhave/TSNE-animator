* first single

CHORUS:(Repeat twice)
(Mac)
Now when I step on the set
They say he did that
Pull up in the six hundred stretch
They say he did that
Presidential wit the baggates
They say he dad that
He did that, (no limit)
He did that.

(Mac)
I got a house with a pool in the back
And every girl I used to know she tryin' to do it wit Mac
And even the ones with them big ol' butts
They become sluts when a nigga ball
Feelin' small cause my middle finger at y'all
Can I ball?, let me take y'all niggas back in '96
When I was two seconds from robbing niggas for they shit
Bustin' niggas in they shit
Privileges from me and my niggas,
til this day ain't nobody seein' my niggas.
There was a line between the real and the fake
But it's gotten thinner, everybody's a pretender
Even people I'm kind ta',
Bitches in my hood yellin', "Where them dollars at?"
"Bitch get's yours!" is what I holler back, cause I'ma mack
Hey, yo Mr Big Paper, you wanna get wit that, don't you?
You ol' dog, always take the girls how much I called you
How I be jockin you,
but you don't be telling them hoes how I be knocking you
Get in them pants and give it to my naggas to

CHORUS:(Repeat twice)
Now when I step on the set
They say he did that
Pull up in the six hundred stretch
They say he did that
Presidential wit them baggetes
They say he did that
He did that, (no limit)
He did that

(Silkk the Shocker)
When I roll up in the stretch, They be like "He did that"
You know there's money involved, we gotta flip that
Tell whodi in the back, I'm tryin' to get that
I'm tryin' to do something to see if she's wit that
So won't you wobble wobble
And watch her shake it shake it
Then drop it drop it, then break it break it
Then I whisper in her ear and tell her what I'm trying to do
Cause I'm a thug girl, even though chicks might find me cute
Fate, I doubt that, me and my soldiers about that
We cock locks and drop the top and hop up out that
Catch me ridin' up in a 4 door Bentley
This chrome look good on 19 but even better on 20's
Tattooed up, this is my click and we a bunch of fools
Boy ya'll gone floss with your lil' jewels,
we make y'all put y'all jewels up(bling bling) 
Lil' Tigger we gon bent that
Them call for small for me and my dogs
Them boys goin' to stretch that.

CHORUS:(Repeat twice)
Now when he steps on the six
They say he did that
Pull up in the six hundred stretch
They say he did that
Presidential wit them baggets
They say he did that
He did that, (no limit)
He did that</pre>
