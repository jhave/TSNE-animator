We can smoke
Uh-huh
Yeah, yeah
Smokin' smokin'
Smokin' smokin'

[TQ]
We can smoke (we can smoke)
We can drink (we can drink)
We can freak the night away (smokin' smokin')
Can we freak the night away?
Can we smoke? (Can we smoke?)
Let's drink (Let's drink)
We gone stunt the night away
Blow blunts around the way

[Baby]
Ma, you can shine with a nigga
If you grind with a nigga
Spend time with yo nigga, mama
Whoa, you can ride with a nigga
Get fly with a nigga
Get high with yo nigga, mama
Whoa, we can blaze the haze
Day to day in the hood
That's what's up
Whodie, we can tow the K (?)
Go around the way
Jumping out the brand new truck
Whodie, situation getting sticky
Nigga blowing on his sticky
Sex, weed and a twist-up
Yeah, I'm in the hood with the metal
Cause I'm good with the ghetto
Nigga playing get fucked up
Yeah, we live the gumbo lives
It's high in spite (?)
We struggled, but we came up
Go, you can look in my eyes
See G's for life
Talking money
Bring my name up

[TQ - Chorus]
We can smoke (we can smoke)
We can drink (we can drink)
We can freak the night away (freak the night away)
Can we freak the night away?
Can we smoke? (Can we smoke?)
Let's drink (Let's drink)
We gone stunt the night away (stunt the night away)
Blow blunts around the way (blunts around the way)

We can smoke the best weed
We can drink the good Cognac (Cognac)
We can do it in my Cadillac (my Cadillac)
Come and smoke with me (come and smoke with me)
See I got that purple haze (purple haze)
And it's time for us to blaze
Can we smoke?

[Mannie Fresh]
Shazzam, damn, a bag of weed
A cup of Cognac and a couple of seeds
Two hot strippers coming out they zippers
We some pimps dude
We don't tip them, they tip us
I got my smoking jacket on
10 feet long
Inhale, exhale, that shit gone
If you ain't got what I'm drinking
Then I'm drinking what ya got
Hey, keep them bitches coming cause I drink a lot
I'm a gulp like a fish
You want some of this?
We can have sex, but you can't have a kiss
She said what's next
Your ever did x?
Ex-girlfriend now I'm cashing your checks
We can jump in the coup
Take a ride by Snoop
He got a lot of weed, you can f like soup
You can smoke, you can drink
Till your lips turn pink
Till you pass out, ass out
Full of that dank

[TQ - Chorus]
We can smoke (we can smoke)
We can drink (we can drink)
We can freak the night away (freak the night away)
Can we freak the night away? (Can we freak the night away?)
Can we smoke? (Can we smoke?)
Let's drink (Let's drink)
We gone stunt the night away (can we stunt the night away?)
Blow blunts around the way (blow blunts around the way)

We can smoke the best weed (We can smoke the best weed)
We can drink the good Cognac (Cognac)
We can do it in my Cadillac (my Cadillac)
Come and smoke with me (come and smoke with me)
See I got that purple haze (purple haze)
And it's time for us to blaze
Can we smoke?

[Baby]
Whoa, we got that golden leaves rolled
With the weed in the middle
Dro stuck to the window blowing
Whoa, nigga feeling real good
He high as he could
Nigga fucked around and blew up
Whoa, we gotta mix it right
The grey goose fired
The blender with the fruit ice
Yeah, nigga look at my life
And see what's inside
You fuck around and blow up
Whoa, then we blaze and blaze
Round the way
We keep both guns tucked, biatch
We read the play
Around the way
For the people coming full up
Whoa, nigga pump your brakes
You're from the state
Nigga know how we came up
Nigga plead the plate
From state to state
Cooking cakes so niggas blow up

[TQ - Chorus]
We can smoke (we can smoke)
We can drink (Smokin' smokin')
We can freak the night away (freak the night away)
Can we freak the night away? (Can we freak the night away?)
Can we smoke? (Can we smoke?)
Let's drink (Let's drink)
We gone stunt the night away (stunt the night away)
Blow blunts around the way (Smokin' smokin')

We can smoke the best weed (the best weed)
We can drink the good Cognac (Cognac)
We can do it in my Cadillac (my Cadillac)
Come and smoke with me (Smokin' smokin' smokin')
See I got that purple haze (Smokin' smokin' smokin')
And it's time for us to blaze
