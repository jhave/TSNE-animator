Geah
In the house for the 94 shot
Eihthype in the house, uh
Half Ounce in the house
Compton bomb, Compton bomb
Geah
West side nigga
You know what's happenin'

Get ready for the funky ass shit
&gt;From the muthafucka that just don't quit
Guarantee the Rag Top the trunks on the bitches
Makin' niggas lock up they low-rider switches uh
Step aside as I bail on my ride
Too close on my jock get bucked with the Glock     
The whole world turns as I bail in the room
Niggas prepare to get slapped with the boom
????????
Got more sacks than my man Richard D
Can't get it nowhere for the West fool
Fuck around with the stress and that ain't cool
You can't handle my shit when it's smokin'
One mo' big ass hittin' and start choking
You can't handle this son so pass it quick
Damn I'm starting to see your mind playing tricks
Geah homie say it's much, too much
Just say you can't touch
The Compton bomb

Compton bomb, the Compton bomb...

The bomb'ton-ass shit is back on your block
Them niggas my team and we packin' much green
So come with your ten bucks and I'll see you
Cruisin' around the corner got the fuckin' sensimilla
Come and get it from Eiht, Bam and Chill
The niggas with the real deal that kill
Dishin' it out like a muthafuckin' waitress
I come up you stay down and you hate this
Fools come from all around to get their dough
Shit, 5.0 can't stop cause it's legit
Every hood to block to street to park
We be floatin' off the shit that's ?????
And ain't no stopping the float through the Compton streets
Where you don't work muthafucka yeah you don't eat
One more come-up I can't stop
Better get down cause they shoots about to pop
Geah I got the 24 hour service
Got the one time's in my city kinda nervous
Geah, I got the money and the power
Makin' a G every hour cause we servin' that...

Compton bomb, the Comtpon bomb...

Damn you can't fuck with it
Put it - down
Fuck with the stress you clown
The niggas with the chronic shit is back on the scene
I'm hearin' sayin' E's got the mean Joe Green
Only the west side fools supplies the bomb
Hitting your ass like a sawed-off pump
Even ?? dip in they save-in's
They come to get to ?????? in special occasions
The bust that'll last long not a quicky
You know it's on when the shit looks sticky
So come get the bomb from the Eiht, Chill and Bam
Damn - your shit is sorrier than the Rams
Grabs shit gets no clientele
The backward boogie just won't fucking sale
Geah, I got to shoot that off, fall up your block
24-7 I'ma cluck cluck cluck off the...
