Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Praise God.
YES, I have danced with the devil
- and I learned all the steps!
You watched me God, and inside you wept.
You reached out for my hand - I turned my back on you.
I thought I knew the plan; but that's not true.
I've learned who I was, and I know now who I am.
Meet me on the dancefloor God, for you.. I will stand.</pre>
