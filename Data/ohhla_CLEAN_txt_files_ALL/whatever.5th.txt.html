[Fiend]
Ahh I'm just doing what the drug dealers do
Makin money and smokin weed with my thug nigga crew
C'Mon I'm just doing what the drug dealers do
Makin money and smokin weed with my thug nigga crew
Ya heard me!??

[Mr. Serv-On]
I got pimps lined up saying the love my game
I got bitches screaming out the gate, hey baby my name
I can't bust for nothing, I can't fight with no ho
I got 10,000 project niggaz rushin my show
Pushin side to side, if they feel what I say
If you scared of real niggaz get the fuck out the way
Never lovin no bitch, I won't live cause I'm rich
3rd ward I represent, yea I'm bleedin for this
I wear my tank with pride, ain't no peace in my eyes
Say the wrong thang promise silly bitch you gon' die
Never fuck with troubles, couldn't run from cowards
Tre 6 ya heard.......the world is ours

[Chorus repeat 2x: Fiend &amp; DJ Paul]
Ahh I'm just doing what the drug dealers do
(It's whatever nigga, it's whatever)
Makin money and smokin weed with my thug nigga crew
(It's whatever nigga, it's whatever)
C'Mon I'm just doing what the drug dealers do
(It's whatever nigga, it's whatever)
Makin money and smokin weed with my thug nigga crew
(It's whatever nigga, it's whatever)
Ya heard me!??

[DJ Paul]
Until I croak, I'm hollerin' don't fuck with my click
It's Hypnotize but I fuss with no cowards bitch
These words that out my mouth, from my heart they come
I cuss bitches with my auto P-90 gun
I cock back and got niggaz like on the run
It's no release on the trigga to job is done
Off in my cooler, bitch, the coward has got no place
We fire shots from a Navi off in ya place
*Blah Blah*

[Juicy J]
We got this whole town killin, M-Town figures
Hooked up with these fools from New Orleans now we bigger
Droppin off them kizy, them junkies yellin pleasy
Can I get it hit before I put ya block on freezy
I told that fuckin junkie, with his nose a runny
Get the fuck up out my face I'm going to make this money
And since I'm always stressin, I keep a smith-n-wessen
I looked em in the face before I put 2 in his chesta

[Chorus repeat 2x: Fiend &amp; DJ Paul]
Ahh I'm just doing what the drug dealers do
(It's whatever nigga, it's whatever)
Makin money and smokin weed with my thug nigga crew
(It's whatever nigga, it's whatever)
C'Mon I'm just doing what the drug dealers do
(It's whatever nigga, it's whatever)
Makin money and smokin weed with my thug nigga crew
(It's whatever nigga, it's whatever)
Ya heard me!??

[Weebie]
I fuck with these thug niggaz, just not givin a fuck nigga
Get lower then a mug nigga, send something through ya jug nigga
Runnin up ya street shootin, shit thats hittin ya dick
Weebie and Three 6 nigga I know ya lovin this shit
Ghetto Platinum certified I die and ride for it
See these hoes that think they wet and don't get it they cry for it
See I gave it to them anyways, I fuck these hoes in many ways
I'm off the block, I'm sizzlin' hot, so hot so many days
Serv-On with 6 shot, with Fiend, ya popped now
We got it on lockdown, we never gon' stop now
Love it or leave it baby cause Weebie gon' set it off
Hatin' on Ghetto Platinum, the trigger I'ma let it off

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
