If I was your girlfriend
Would you remember
To tell me all the things you forgot
If I was your man
Hey hey, yeah
If I was your man

If I was your best friend
Would you let me
Take care of you
Do all the things that only your best friend can
Oh oh oh
Only best friends can
Ooh

	If I was your girlfriend
	If I was your girlfriend

[T-Boz]
If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress ya
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless
But sometimes
Sometimes those are the things that being in love's about

If I was your one and only friend
Would you run to me
If somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me
Yeah yeah ooh
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please, yeah
Oh oh

Repeat 1

[T-Boz]
If I was your girlfriend
I know I could treat you right
I could see what you see
And hear what you hear
But most of all, heh
I could feel what you feel
Oh, make me wanna say

Shoo doop do
Shoo doop do
If I was your girlfriend
