Album:  Rodentity
Song:   The Powers of Observation
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Cno Evil]
Yeah, Rodentz, Li-Mouse, Cno Evil

[sample from "V for Vendetta"]
Your powers of observation, continue to serve you well

[Chorus 2X: Cno Evil]
Ya'll wanna act up? Ya'll get clapped up
Fuck around with Li, and get mack trucked
Ya'll wanna act up? Ya'll get clapped up
Fuck around with C, and get ya ass snuffed

[Cno Evil]
The rise of the silver burner, I thought I told ya
I roll over your raps like a lawnmower
I'd like to make a toast to myself, so hold the glass up
While my brother Lil' Gatti rolls that grass up
Who ran you over with the Hummer, it's my brother
Faster than the speed, it's Bulletz, taking over this summer
Then hear the beep-beep of the Jeep, L.G.
Pass the piece, we about to creep on those who sleep
So wake the fuck up, or get broke the fuck up
The wisdom we apply, son, soak this shit up
Rodentz combine, rear view those behind me
Laugh when I shoot, like Chris Moltisanti
It's Johnny Boy, I got the Tommy toy-gun
You a bitch like a mommy's boy, son
Child, you mild, while we spicy, burn, hot
You got to learn to wait your turn, believe it or flop
Ugh, shout out to that kid named Petey Wonka
Mack truck, like Mouse said, and not that toy Tonka
He don't roll wih an empty 'Lude, no E. Honda
Bout to shock with that thunder, like that boy Blanka

[Chorus 2X: Li-Mouse]
Ya'll wanna act up? Ya'll get clapped up
Fuck around with Li, and you get mack trucked
Ya'll wanna act up? Ya'll get clapped up
Fuck around with C, and you get ya ass snuffed

[Li-Mouse]
I pull ya wig back like shifting to second
The beat carries me, while my vocals are my weapon
These wack ass rappers ain't dropping no gems
In fact, you just stuck up, like, some flower stems
Jewelry, rims and the so-called bitches
I refuse to reduce myself for the riches
So the fuck what if I got to go the rough road
Combinations are sick, locksmith the tough code
I'm on this track like tires in Daytona
Like CEO's and businesses, I own ya
But yo, I ain't afraid to have 'wars' with 'stars' like Lucas
When deadly sulfar is formed in my mucas

[sample from "V for Vendetta"]
Who are you?
	Who? Who is but the form
	Following the function of what
	And what I am, is a man in a mask
Oh, I can see that
	Of course you can
	I'm not questioning your powers of observation
	I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
	Of asking a masked man, who he is
Oh, well... </pre>
