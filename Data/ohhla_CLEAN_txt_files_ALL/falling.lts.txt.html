[Intro]
Do not jump sir please whatever you do please do not jump
Yea hi look uh, there's a guy and he's on a building, uh and he looks like he's gonna jump
Yea I uh I'm on the... I am on uh, fuck, do you know where we are? JUMP!
Why the hell are you telling him to jump? JUMP! DON'T JUMP!

[Violent J]
I don't get this
Fuck sickness and livin with this
Never get to forget this
Not even on Christmas
No way to dismiss this
What the fuck is this
They tell me it's all in my head why can't I get a witness
Fuck it I was never meant to be and now my own hater
Up the elevator
On the rooftop seconds later
Lookin over the ledge about to plunge
Take a deep breath in my lungs
Here the street comes

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
This is it, my last step, my last crawl
My last attempt to reach out and touch the one to call
My phone's been cut off and bills are pilin up so high
I'm on this ledge and fully prepared to die
Police lights litterin streets beneath my feet
Fifty stories below I can here them hollering, "Freeze
It's all okay, just give it another day."
They turn to screams as I step off and drift away

[Chorus]
I'm fallin, drop to the bottom fast
Death on impact, about to crash
I float up and around now I'm somehow flyin
I've been given another chance to live, fuck dyin
I'm fallin, drop to the bottom fast
Death on impact, about to crash
I float up and around now I'm somehow flyin
I've been given another chance to live, fuck dyin

[Monoxide Child]
You think I'm doin this shit for fun
The second time in a week, but the first was just a practice run
Don't need a gun to end all of my suffering
All I need to do is jump, get these evil voices outta me
You don't love the fact that every night
You hear whispers convincing you to end it all by daylight
I'm about to take flight and shut em all up
Just thought I'd let you know the real reason that Paul jumped

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I'm lookin over this ledge at these matchbox cars
Fifty-seven levels up and ya hit that concrete hard
Why my meds don't work no more
Why my doc quit on me
I rung his neck, his eyes popped, he don't wanna see me obviously
Now I'm waitin for my balls to grind this concrete and crumble
A gang of mother fuckers sayin, "Don't do it you won't see no trouble"
Next thing I know I heard loud screams holy fuck
The ground's comin my way mighty fast cause I just jumped

[Chorus]
I'm fallin, drop to the bottom fast
Death on impact, about to crash
I float up and around now I'm somehow flyin
I've been given another chance to live, fuck dyin
I'm fallin, drop to the bottom fast
Death on impact, about to crash
I float up and around now I'm somehow flyin
I've been given another chance to live, fuck dyin

I'm fallin, ahhhhhhhhh, death on impact about to crash
Fuck fuck dyin, fuck dyin, fuck fuck dyin, fuck dyin
I'm fallin, ahhhhhhhhh, death on impact about to crash
Fuck fuck dyin, fuck dyin, fuck fuck dyin, fuck dyin

[Jamie Madrox]
My fingers scratch into the building as I pull up and climb
Feel like I'm a spider inside of my mind
Passin windows up with every story up I go
Takin a look inside, people sittin in cubicles
While I'm out here losin it, scalin the bricks
The higher up that I crawl the more that I'm feelin sick
Once I get to the top I can let it all go
As I fall through the air to the sidewalk below

[Chorus]
I'm fallin, drop to the bottom fast
Death on impact, about to crash
I float up and around now I'm somehow flyin
I've been given another chance to live, fuck dyin
I'm fallin, drop to the bottom fast
Death on impact, about to crash
I float up and around now I'm somehow flyin
I've been given another chance to live, fuck dyin

Fuck fuck dyin, fuck dyin, fuck fuck dyin, fuck dyin
I float up and around now I'm somehow flyin
I've been given another chance to live, fuck dyin
Fuck fuck dyin, fuck dyin, fuck fuck dyin, fuck dyin
I float up and around now I'm somehow flyin
I've been given another chance to live, fuck dyin
Fuck fuck dyin, fuck dyin, fuck fuck dyin, fuck dyin
I float up and around now I'm somehow flyin
I've been given another chance to live, fuck dyin</pre>
