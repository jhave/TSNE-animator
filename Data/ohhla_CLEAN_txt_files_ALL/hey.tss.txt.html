[Silk-E]
Ha ha ha heyyyy {*4X*}

[Too $hort over Silk-E]
Whassup baby?

[Too $hort]
If you ain't busy later on, I'ma play a new song
You could sing along, and if you say it's too long
I put the tip in; it won't go too deep
I'm sure it's everything you always hoped it would be
Last year, the time wasn't right for us
But now, I cain't fight the lust
I wanna be all alone wit'chu
So we can do everything the song says do

[Silk-E]
Walk up and kiss my shoulder
Whisper somethin sweet in my ear
Tell me boy, that I need to know
Promise I'll never bore ya
Got that special place for ya
Can you be the reason I drove

[Chorus: Silk-E]
Got a stress-free zone when you wanna come see me (hey)
Got a Honeycomb Hideout; wanna come meet me? (hey)
Cause I feel you tinglin in my bones (hey)
Cause I love when your number go across my phone (hey)

[Too $hort]
Take a lil' sip, have a lil' smoke
Listen to the music and take it real slow
Ain't no rush, we waited this long
for the moment, the right day to get it on
I see it in your eyes - you're surprised
Never would have thought I would be this size
I'm in between your thighs, now you realize
this is what we doin for the rest of our lives

[Silk-E]
Heh~! Me and my dude used to fight about it
All night I knew somethin wasn't right about it
That's why you can't settle in with anybody
So now I'm cool...
Didn't call, tryin to keep a low on the drama
Unfinished business so you know I'm glad I found ya
Plus I'm a big girl
and I wanna show what I can do

[Chorus]

[Too $hort]
Whassup baby? I wanna fuck wit'chu
I wanna hold you close and touch you too
Back then, we ain't have much to do
but things change, and now we stuck like glue
Used to love him, now you don't trust that dude
You with me every day, so it must be true
It's the game; caon't be real without it
If you choose it, tell me how you feel about it

[Silk-E] + {Too $hort}
I want you in my zone now, baby come see me (hey)
On my way to the hideout {what'chu doin tonight baby} (hey)
Won't you please hold me close {yeah I'm 'bout to come through}
{You ready?} Take everything but my business just to fuck with you
{Hey...}</pre>
