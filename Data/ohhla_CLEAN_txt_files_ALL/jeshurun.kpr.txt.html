(Chorus) Priest
We will shine in his presence
The truthful - when we find all his blessings
The power - we shall receive
Yahwu - eternity
The judgment - is coming swiftly
The kingdom - the golden city
That mission - fire and brimstone
Freedom - no more hate 'cause our skin tone

[Killah Priest]
What if you found out everything you've been told was a lie
And the only way to find out the truth was to go inside yourself
And no one to provide you with help
Would you reach for that nine in your belt?
Or go get the rifle from you shelf
Put the barrel to your mouth and blow your own brains out
Or do you want a second to figure this whole thing out?
What if I told you nothing is really what it appears to be
You wouldn't believe me
Cause you a program from reality
Little fluffy bears, little cute lions
Thanksgiving Day, the underworld alliance
Secret societies, the brotherhood system
You can only join as a client
Spy satellite dishes, Christmas, the protocols of Zion
Science they stole from the Mayans
What if you found out the man in the pic
posing as Jesus was really Cesare -- Borgia
Would you do some study on that?
And would you really care?
What if you found out that the United States was a business
That's why they never address the president as the president of America
Would you go in mass hysteria?
But the president of a corp like your boss
Your corp is named United States
Would you unite or separate?
So who's the presidents of Americans?

(Chorus) Priest
Glory - we shall shine in his presence
The truthful - when we find all his blessings
The power - we shall receive
Yahwu - eternity
The judgment - is coming swiftly
The kingdom - the golden city
That mission - fire and brimstone
Freedom - no more hate 'cause our skin tone
It's coming - with angels with swords
The fallen - shall be my war
For us - Jeshurun
For us - Jeshurun

[Victorious]
From ashes to skull and bone
Bone to flesh, back to life, back to breath
Out of the dark came the light
And out of the life back to death
We all gotta go, it's the inevitable
Like the meek humble, good in heart
Inheriting the Merrill Lynch, fuck the sharing
We want America for vacation spot
Gracious opt, mansions in Morocco
Vatos, no more potholes
We sell the pacific, terrific ain't it
Known nation wide we famous for the ink pen paintbrush
Cause animals ain't us
We the royal family, lost tribes in Egypt
Fell victim to the vanity
No different from the cameras we be in
Damaging the man and your sin is the end result
Diminishing even though we need the benjamins
Balance is the key, I'm ready for a dominion y'all
I'm finished man

(Chorus) Priest
Glory
The truthful
The power - we shall receive
Yahwu - eternity
The judgment - is coming swiftly
The kingdom - the golden city
That mission - fire and brimstone
Freedom - no more hate 'cause our skin tone
It's coming - with angels with swords
The fallen - shall be my war
For us - Jeshurun
For us - Jeshurun</pre>
