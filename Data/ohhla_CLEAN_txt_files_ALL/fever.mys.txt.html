Humph, Come on 
 
(Verse 1)
It's the nigga that get hard than starch in yo fuckin creases  
rip it to pieces  
slicin and dicin and icin em right
with the mic I use 
that's as clean as a wild teacher 
eyes stay tight when they fade 
to watch swarm bleedin 
from out the freeza 
can't you see em? Jesus!
Big tittie Tina boppas out chea catchin Mystikal Fever 
Ol you'll be sayin you ain't takin no shit this time 
Nigga me neither!
You could leave nigga fuck we don't need ya 
Rapper, killer, loaded, beat, 
swivel, shark, butchers meat CLEAVER {*knife sound*)
a lot of you niggas believe in walkin a thin line 
but when I get through wit cha all I be hearin is awwah!!
Of all maps and adages knocking off hats
Y all know 
act a ass 
But don't call me that 
Fix yo fuckin shirt 
tie yo fuckin shoe strangs
jive and Mystikal comin up in the bull dagger
 
(chorus)
big tittie bitches catchin Mystikal fever

(Verse 2)
keep my motherfuckin fist balled up
case a mutherfucka tryin to start somethin 
takin ginseng got yo lil dick hard makin it harder 
think you gon jump in the ring and go pound for pound with the knockout king?
No shit like that gon happen cause them 
niggas down here ain't gon fuck wit what I bring  
you heard the the motherfuckin door open 
you heard that arrrr (door open sound) you know that's me 
if it was a wrestlin match you'll be on your back like 1&amp;2&amp;3
come off the top ropes leave you knocked out wit yo mouth open 
and they gon have to take yo ass home and leave you in a hot tub and soak
bar banga and if you don't want swang 
wit a mic I tell you nigga 
I m wild ass a gorilla on chain 
Time to flow wit a natural-born go getter 
This for my hustlas to ballas, gangstas and cap pealers
hustlas to ballas 
gangstas and cap pealers
hustlas and gangstas
gangstas and cap pealers
hustlas to ballas 
gangstas and cap pealers
 
(chorus)

big tittie bitches catchin big tittie bitches catchin Mystikal fever 
aaw oh, aaw oh

(Verse 3)
I'll go pound for pound wit the knuckle cuffin motherfucka
Rush em and touch em 
Then stand ova his ass and screamin I told you not to start nuthin 
I'ma damage ya 
You ain't got the stamina 
Half the talent to match, to dance wit the tarantula 
When I'ma chargin at cha 
niggas be tryin to copy cat  
wanna jump on the mic and do what I do but can't keep up 
ain't no thankin 
that'shit gon change 
cause when I drop off Mystikal sound a likes 
gon have to get the fuck off
crackin they glasses 
smashin they records 
smash and catchin they ass all day and tackle they ass 
tell em all settle shop down close fo sho 
put it down like 1990 M.C. Hammer 
I hope
