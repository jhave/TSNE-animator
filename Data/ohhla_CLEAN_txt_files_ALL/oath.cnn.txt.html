[Kumasi from "Crips and Bloods: Made in America" sample]
One thing you have to realize
If you opened them up, there would be a stamp under their shirt that
says Made in America"
Ok, not no place else
They werent made in Taiwan or you know, Indonesia
They were made in America

[Interlude: N.O.R.E.]
The family is the family
This oath is this oath
And I will die before I break it
And when we grow, we grow as one

"I've sworn an oath"

[N.O.R.E.]
Late night fistfights, with bare knuckles
Nowadays, niggas probably wouldn't dare scuffle
It's big guns aimed at your nozzle, big Roscoe
Donnie Brasco wish death to they vato
Cigarette smoking, on the crater for the corner store
Same place as the ambulance and corridor
Growing up seeing dead bodies in the lobby
I used to hate the smell of it, then I got used to it
Just for the hell of it, young man, intelligent
I always know that the police was the enemy
And every dead president I make will be a friend of me
Bitches ain't shit, cuz most of them is evil
And most of them hoes start more wars than we do
Circle, cycle, three sixty trifling
When a baby is born somebody else life end
From the birth canal to the hearse, we enlighten

[Interlude: Capone]
The family is the family
This oath is this oath
And I will die before I break it
And when we grow, we grow as one

"I've sworn an oath"

[Capone]
Aiyo, dead bodies found in the building, OD'ing on heroine
Early morning, needing they medicine
Elephant arms, used to control the bombs
Islam, ay Shallah, niggas bulletproof kufis
Just to live out another script in this life's movie
The corner's snatch you, murder if you have to
Dead niggas can't talk, they haunt like a castle
I wasn't the type that go out tagging
I spray your face like a PD, I was chopping and bagging
Capone-N-Noreaga, that's a blood oath, prick fingers
Like Albert Anastasia, the wildest nature
My calibrators on a higher level, I riot with the devil
Walk righteous, canaries in them bezel
Death before dishonor, money over bitches I'm my brother's keeper
I throw the world in the sleeper, I'm so eager to blast
Bilingual, I be speaking in cash

[Interlude: Raekwon]
The family is the family
This oath is this oath
And I will die before I break it
And when we grow, we grow as one

"I've sworn an oath"

[Raekwon]
Shallah, a letter to the loyal, we dedicated, most of us elevated
Or fell into a pine box that's ultra suaded
Cast iron metal, new Beretta's, blue leathers
Snake bites, Timberlands, few gelettas
Reward me a God, I'm a multiple crop, multiple stocks
They violate us they get multiple shots
You might get picked off, or toast two with Heinekens
We under the building, designer gems on with uzi's, hoodie coogi's
All I know is prosper, lobster fish, this is a mobster dish
Fly around in Masi's, sipping sakes
Twenty one iron down allegiance, the days of repentance
We hate bosses, we just know the consequences
Used to sniff, pull out then squeeze, now I roll with a gift
My only rift is why we coaching them thieves
We just Allah babies, save us from the block, and keep our family one
And pray five times a day, saves alot

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
The family is the family
This oath is this oath
And I will die before I break it
And when we grow, we grow as one

"I've sworn an oath"

[Busta Rhymes]
Russian Roulette, nigga, PULL IT!
Shots tear smell us when you move like you stupid
Pop 'berg, water boil bubble when I cook it
Look it, the criminal mind niggas that's crooked
Speak third person, nigga, build with my liaison
We move quiet, nigga, more secretive than a Mason
Based on, the coppers handle niggas when they bust 'em
I'm honoring an oath, while we live by the old customs
Politic with foreign niggas, regular, we fly the jets
Speaking in code, when they struggle, unravel the dialect
Every kind of foreign currency is what we try to get it
Crap table gamble, nigga, hunt your million dollar bet
Better know I must collect, hope you got it for me
And an oath is something I learned is alluded as a shorty, now
I hope you niggas don't mistake it
Will defend it and later in a grave before we break it</pre>
