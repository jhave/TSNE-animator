[Crunchy Black]
Yeah I rob, Yeah I steal
Yeah I put ya body in a field
I ain't fakin no deal, just tryin to get a meal
Hustlin out here, understand my skill
This money gotta be made, made to the grave
Till death do us part, somebody gotta pay
Pay what they way, pay what they make
Don't makes no difference, I gotta get paid
Nigga, hustlin, out here on the streets
Tip toe down nigga, I ain't tryin to be beat
Like a hoe out here, like hustlin the street
Tryin to get her somethin so her pimp can eat
Ain't nothin goin on but the money and the power
Got one in the chamber for you weak ass cowards
If you keep talkin shit, I'mma come and get ya
CB is my name, and I ain't playin wit ya bitches
