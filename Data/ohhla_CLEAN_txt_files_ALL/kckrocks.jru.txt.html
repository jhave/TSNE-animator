[Jeru]
I apologize to all persons that I have hurt in the past

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, so sorry
Please accept my apology

[Jeru]
Damn son, you getting tight? I ain't mean it, it was a joke, damn
you..you.. you can't take a joke? C'mon man. You know what?

[Verse One]
I'm sorry I ain't the hero that you need in your life
I'm sorry but sometimes I tend to live thrive
I'm sorry I can't say what you want me to say
I'm sorry I'm bound to flip up on any given day
I'm sorry y'all seem conceeded but I know my shit's fly
I'm sorry I lost my temper and punched you in the eye
I'm sorry I can't live up to your expectations
I'm sorry if how I move causes you frustration
I'm sorry that a brother have all type of hang ups
I'm sorry I quit smoking 'cause now I drink too much
I'm sorry I make mistakes that I can't take back
Like busting guns and selling crack
I'm sorry to all the cats that I hit in the head
I'm sorry I get violent when I get real fed
I'm sorry I couldn't be your better friend
But I do the right thing if I could do it again
I'm sorry I couldn't be there when you needed help
I'm sorry but I was busy tryin' to help myself
I'm sorry, that life is filled with all type of hard knocks
But if you can't handle it, then, kick rocks

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, so sorry

[Verse Two]
I'm sorry if you think that I'm a dirty such &amp; such
I'm sorry I got a big mouth and talk too much
I'm sorry my first album couldn't save the world
And if at any point in life, I hit your girl
I'm sorry if sometimes I'm contradictory
I'm sorry MCs try hard but they can't see me
I'm sorry I don't work with your favourite producer
I'm sorry I can't quit 'cause I'm not a loser
I'm sorry but I have to walk with my head high
I'm sorry my mind state is not just getting by
I'm sorry for things I said 'cause I know I offend
I'm sorry but I call it like I see it my friend
I'm sorry if we met and you thought I was rude
But I make it a habit not to hang with duds
I'm sorry if I generically signed you autograph
I'm sorry if you feel I ain't bring the heat since the Wrath
I'm sorry if I ignored you tryin' to spit to some chick
I'm sorry but sometimes I think with my dick
I'm sorry for knowing the godly but dealing with earth
This is a formal apology for what it's worth
I'm sorry but life is filled with all type of hard knocks
And if you can't handle it, pssst, kick rocks

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, so sorry
Please accept my apology

[Jeru]
Is that good enough? You feel better now? Listen...

[Verse three]
I'm sorry I'm not the man that you want me to be
I'm sorry I don't understand and you can't understand me
I'm sorry for all the feelings that I hurt in the past
If you thought it was gonna be more than me tapping that ass
I'm sorry if we kicked it and we got too close
I can't deal with commitment so I'm sorry I'm ghost
I'm sorry I got honeys all over the place
I'm sorry that I learned to lie with a poker face
I'm sorry to all the chicks that I gassed on tour
Told'em I keep in touch but I don't see them no more
I'm sorry we was involved and you got your heart broken
I'm sorry it went down like that I ain't joking
I'm sorry it had to be that way
I'm sorry for all the games I felt I had to play
I'm sorry if I was grimy and I hit your friend
And even though I'm sorry I'd probably do it again
I'm sorry sometimes I only think of myself
I'm sorry I ain't warned you before we dealt
I'm sorry Shortee said I was her favourite rapper
I'm sorry I had no self control and had to tap her

I'm sorry life is filled with all type of hard knocks
And if you can't handle it, shortee, kick rocks</pre>
