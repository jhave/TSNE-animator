Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Who'da ever thought it would be me
Talkin to you about life, I'm the Eve
And then a lot of wrong and rights never easy
I'm tryna make it through like you might need me

[Verse 1]
Ayo, every day it's a struggle
Waking up, stressed emotions I juggle
As I look around and watch the world crumble
Something tell me pray you'd always stay humble
Yea, what doesn't kill you only make you stronger
Stay chin up, hold on a little longer
They used to tell me, they tell me I ain't have a voice
But then the angel showed me a better choice
Never let the world tell me how I'm defined
I give myself credit, never need a co-sign
Some days I cry but then I think and realize
I'm a star and damn it, I'm a shine
Show the world all the greatness that I posses
Gotta keep on pushin, keep on makin progress
If a beautiful rose can grow from concrete
Then there's no reason for me to accept defeat

[Chorus]
Tell the world for me
Who'll miss me when I'm gone?
What's a fight without defeat
What's a day when there's no Eve

Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone

[Verse 2]
Remember like a permanent scar
The feeling I had when you said I wouldn't go far
I knew how to shine but life kept me in the dark
Dreamin I'm the moon, 'cause the world's too hard
Goals with no plan, runnin through quick sand
Thought I'll go under but I'm still breathing
Not afraid of war so I keep fightin
I'm worth a lifetime, no one nice in
So I go back to the lab again, grab me a pad and pen
Write a legacy for my children's children
Build a world for everybody to live in
And who would me I'd gladly do it again
Wouldn't believe, now I know that I'm chosen
And everyone that kept it G, I owe them
Treasure my heart so I always stay golden
Live for the dream and I'm lovin the moment

[Chorus]
Tell the world for me
Who'll miss me when I'm gone?
What's a fight without defeat
What's a day when there's no Eve

Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone

[Verse 3]
Hey, there are many moments in life
That make you feel the only option maybe is to fight back
And it feel foreign to you 'cause you ain't like that
Never let nobody steal your powers, now's your right back
You gotta be the person you was born to be
I learned the only person I could control is me
And maybe they will see your style I mean eventually
And even is they don't you got the right to disagree
Now listen, I ain't got the answers or the plan
Me, I'm tryna figure out, tryna understand
Tryna be the best woman I could be for a man
Love is to be shared so I give mine

[Bridge]
I'll go hard, I'll go hard
And this time I won't miss
I'll go hard, I'll go hard
On top of the world I'll live

[Chorus]
Tell the world for me
Who'll miss me when I'm gone?
What's a fight without defeat
What's a day when there's no Eve

Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone

[Bridge]
I'll go hard, I'll go hard
And this time I won't miss
I'll go hard, I'll go hard
On top of the world I'll live

[x2]
Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone</pre>
