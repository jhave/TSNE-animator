[Intro: Knoc-Turn' al]
Ahhh!
It's a good day in LA, yes it is (yes it is)
Motherfuckers can just wake up and relax
And smoke a fat blunt or some shit
Buy a fifth a Henn and get drunk (yes)
Hey, bring that over, call them up
Order me some motherfucking (Knoc-Turn' al) Hennesy

[Verse 1: Knoc]
Wu-Tang got mansions in the hills
Hoe squat thick, hoe squat paying bills
Red &amp; Meth on hot wheels bumping down Sunset
La Maridia, sky balling, what is this?
My eyes, they caught up in the sea, look at Jay-Z
At the Source's Swap Meet getting Memphis Bleek some fitted khakis
Yeah, well real niggas get passes sometimes
Out of bounds in the land of the sunshine
Even Biggie said he was coming back (coming back)
And if he did, we would accept him because a nigga is black
You bleed just like us
Picture me being scared of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
You bleed just like us
Was a song I did, bumped on blocks and beaches with beat in my trunk

[Chorus: S-Dog, Knoc]
[S-Dog] Night and day
[Knoc] Where 80 percent of the population gang bangs
Most of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love
[S-Dog] LA!
[Knoc] Yeah
[S-Dog] Night and day
Welcome players we'll gangster step
[Knoc] Some of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love
[S-Dog] LA!
Night and day
[Knoc] Sraight up (what?)
[S-Dog] Welcome players we'll gangster step

[Verse 2: Knoc]
You can catch LL on Venice Beach on Sundays catching sun rays
I is playing this little game
Like watching ass sway back and forth (what up, girl?)
Macking the most, stripes on my coat, a bragging boast (West Coast!)
Jennifer Lopez and Puffy at Miyagi's eating sushi
Now, tell me what else does your eyes see
A lot of other Coast niggas pass through frequently and it's cool
Because y'all pay dues and I pay them too

[Chorus: S-Dog, Knoc]
[Knoc] Some of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love
[S-Dog] LA!
[Knoc] Yeah
[S-Dog] Night and day
[Knoc] Turn it up
[S-Dog] Welcome players we'll gangster step
[Knoc] Some of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love
[S-Dog] LA!
[Knoc] We in the land of the sunshine where bitches have good times
Palm trees and sea breezes
And I'm out to find a fly fine girl so I can try out my new mack lines

[Verse 3: Knoc]
You seen The Lox? (yes), Ludacris? (no)
Too $hort? (yes), that's my dog (so)
I did a rap with him to increase my (dough)
Was he dope? (yes)
Is he fake? (no)
Weak game? (banging), hop ('64's)
Four or five deep with three or four (hoes)

[Chorus: S-Dog, Knoc]
[S-Dog] Night and day
[Knoc] Where 80 percent of the population gang bangs
Some of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love
[S-Dog] LA!
Night and day
[Knoc] Straight up
[S-Dog] Welcome players we'll gangster step
[Knoc] Most of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love
[S-Dog] LA!
[Knoc] In the land of the sunshine where bitches have good times
Palm trees and sea breezes
And I'm out to find a fly fine girl so I can try out my new mack lines

[Outro: Knoc]
Yeah, fly is the weather - I feel the breeze
L.A.C. night and day
Inner city living with inner city game
Casuas fat laces on some new Chuck's (yes)
I got my running shoes on
Gangstered out from head to toe (head to toe)
Fucking hoes and patroling the hood
Heat on my lap looking for a light
Because, uh, I just rolled up a chronic sack
That's some, that's some good shit</pre>
