Never not enough for you

You saw you at the bar
With a couple of your friends
Thinking you can bring them all
Soon as I hit the door
To hit the floor
I'm on some star shit
Before I know I got a bad pitch up in my car
I pull out my cigar hit the gas
And I'm gone
She know what it is
So ain't no need to ask where we goin' (goin')
A glass of patrone
Out the slider got you ready
I'm feelin' make it hot (hot)
So you don't forget
I tell her (what you tell her)
I can make you famous (yeahh)

Wanna know if I can get you home
Hope we don't wake the neighbours
She lick her lollipop
And I'm her favorite flavor (yeaahh)

You know who I am
Girl I'm in the spot

All your little friends about the cars

And you ain't like them same girls
Or my only one
But I'll make you my main girl
When nigga call your phone
You like click (click) click
We posing for them cameras like flick (flick) flick
What can I say but

And I can have you when I start to roll
Just like you should be (like you should be)

And you a pop bottle top model beauty queen (yeahh)
