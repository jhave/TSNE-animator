[AMG]
When I first met you, you ain't have love for me
Now you got rug burns, and sweatin' out your perm
Tellin' your friends how I got it good
Spreadin' my name all through your hood
And I'm glad you ain't got a man
And I'm glad you ain't quit the band
And I'm glad you ain't nobodys baby mama
Cause a nigga don't want the drama
Sittin' lookin' pretty in my silk pajamas
Blowin' me kisses, eatin' left-over Benihana's
And I can't wait 'til you're through
Cause I got somethin' that I wanna do, ooh

[Chorus]
Soak me baby, give me that good thing
Make it go round and round
Make it come all way down
Soak me baby, give me that good thing
Make it go round and round
Yeah yeah

[AMG]
You got the kinda look in your eyes
that makes me wanna marry you
But first let me carry you... to the California king
How many carats do you want in your ring?
Do you like ice cream?... Let me licky-licky
It's gettin' sweet, cum 'til you sleep
Later you can beep me or leave a voicemail
With your lil' moist tail
And you know I'll be back 'cause I love the act
of makin' love, fly like a dove
Intelligent lady with class
You make me wanna tattoo your name on my ass
Cause I love the way that you do it all
Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
And you look so good to me
Sometimes I wish that I couldn't see, ooh wee

[Chorus]
Soak me baby, give me that good thing
Make it go round and round
Make it come all way down
Soak me baby, give me that good thing
Make it go round and round
Yeah yeah

[AMG]
I wanna get you wet like you wanna get
When I dip between your hips with a thousand licks
No tricks, no hands, AMG is the man
with the plan while I'm hittin' the back and, prepare for the mackin'
I'm stackin', but it ain't your business
I'm goin' up in this - from the CPT to Venice
The 'G got a thousand sluts, that can get these nuts
From they face to butt, say what, say what, ah ah

[DJ Quik]
I used to get sex up in my NSX
Now it's a four-door Benz, for you and my friends
And you got us playin' musical chairs
Baby could you drive while I lick yo' pubical hairs?
I like your pretty freckles, pre-cut speckles
Droppin' player 'phernalia while you lick the genetalia huh
So come out of that sweater and don't worry 'bout the stains
cause I got a gang of black leather in the back, make it wet

[Chorus] - X 4
Soak me baby, give me that good thing
Make it go round and round
Make it come all way down
Soak me baby, give me that good thing
Make it go round and round
Yeah yeah</pre>
