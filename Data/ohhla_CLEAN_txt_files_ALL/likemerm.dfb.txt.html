[JD]
One two three
Hazardous plain to see
I go by the name of Jermaine Dupri
Dope Man Fresh in the place to be, and uh

[Chorus]
Oh I think they like me
Oh I think they like oh I oh I think they like me. (Repeat)

[JD]
Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
so its only right that I hit you with a (imitate record scratching)
Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
so its only right that I hit you with another one

[Verse 1]
Yeah niggaz like me, hataz wanna fight me
Yeah ya bitch mad cause I came up ova night B
Now I'll switch it up, I got a 9 cuff tightly
So you'd better do the right thing like Spike Lee
Yeah I'm super clean, rock jeans wit a white tee
Niggaz fuckin soft but them niggaz wanna bite me
If you had 6 figures you'd be just like me
Yeah these niggaz mad cause I'm shinin like a light B
Niggaz talkin bout YEP in they mother fuckin throw back
He aint real you know that, Muhammad where they sold that
We steppin on these niggaz like a mother fuckin door mat
When I hit the scene they take pictures, call me Kodak
These ho's goin crazy, yeah I think they need some prozac
We the hottest thing on the market and you know that
Ya bitch chosed up an she don't wanna go back
We stackin big faces cause we still spendin all that

[JD]
When I do it, its somethin like thriller in manilla man
Known as a killer man, fresh from the dealer man
So So niggaz, aint no crew illa than
10 acres of land and I got about a million
Dollaz worth of cars in my front yard
I'm from the place in ATL where young niggaz sling hard
Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit you with another one
Remix, we gets busy over here, no sleep
Niggaz stay up on their grizzy ova here
We young, we fly, we gon flashy till the day that we die

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
They don't wanna fight me
I'm snatchin ya ass up
First nigga act up s' the first nigga gettin bust
Majestic gettin shredded while I'm twirlin and switchin so
T-shirt stravaganza, (Franchise, dem white tee boyz)
Self made self paid
We lounge around in our white tee
Ashy black shirt well deep down to ya brown tee
My hundred throwback who sport a jersey by Ali
And if he make one, hell naw they dont sike me
I'm all about my cash ride around wit a nice piece
Ear piece ice piece they straight like me
You heard pimpin playa (yeah they shine so brightly)
Don't stand so close vision blurrs when ice blings
Respect my whole squad no you can't even touch us cuz
Role out the red carpet high 5 and show us love
Carry barrettas count cheddar we trendsettas
I'm a franchize nigga have a mil or betta

[Da Brat]
Six 0, six fo fo, six nine fo
blow dro' wit the windows up on deuce fo's
candy paint, brand new, think I aint
same chick, same clique, mo' bricks in the bank
Know now, no ho-down, throw down like Brat
It aint no show down for no crown I'm holdin that (thats right)
they ???? pay great till this day
been in love with the mic, since Run DMC said "walk this way"
I talk this way cause I'm gangsta a shi-town legend
I'm not ordinary people it's a star in your presence
I'm so icy that my earlobes hurt for what its worth
Don't test me I got the four fith under the skirt
Thick in the the thighs cant touch that
Stay on my grind, I bust back if I must act and empty a stack
Its B to the R-A-T trust that I'm crazy, JD pays me, I'm such a fuckin lady

[Bow Wow]
I'm Bow Weezy, prince of the O-town
Just got the wheels clean, so I'm ridin slow now
I'm in a fast car, somethin like a nascar
If you wanna know how much it cost you should ask pa
As far as the watch and chains
I dropped some change, its easy for me to cop them things
And I don't stop, I got rocks an rings, you know
The same size as a boxing ring
Swimming pool in the front, in the back yard, I aint gotta act hard
I'm under 21 with a black card
And yea I know that was kind of a low blow
But the do' for the So So don't come slow

Chorus (repeat JD's part "oh I think they like me when they heard...")</pre>
