Typed by: AZ Lyrics

* Summer 2014

If you live for something
You're not
Alone, my friend
So fill up your cup and
Lift your lighter
And toast to life

Luda!
They say what don't kill me
Can make me stronger
So two drinks a night
Should help me live longer
I blow some smoke
Just to give my lungs a test
Cause why tip-toe through life
To arrive safely at death
I'm on a journey
Yeah, I'm on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes
Just to open my soul
And tonight is the night
I gotta feeling that I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks
Me and Usher are about to break some rules

That's somewhere to go
But the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke
A lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

[Beat break]

For the rest of my life

If I got one life to live
I'm a party 'til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth living
If it's not on the edge
Tryna keep my balance I'm twisted
So just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say
Women, weed and alcohol

That's somewhere to go
But the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke
A lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

[Beat break]

If you live for something
You're not
Alone, my friend
So fill up your cup and
Lift your lighters
And toast to life

Yeah, I'm stuck in this moment
Freeze the hands of time
Cause I feel inner peace
When I'm outta my mind
And you can call me crazy
But I like to roll the dice
So I'm willing to bet that I'm a be crazy
For the rest of my life

For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

For the rest of my life
