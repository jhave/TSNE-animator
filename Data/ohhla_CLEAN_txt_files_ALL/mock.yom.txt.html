(Yeah!)

Gimme some bass

[ radio reporter ]
We have here the members of the group Yomo &amp; Markie
And they'll be speaking on R&amp;B selling out to rap
I'm Leslie Burell
And we'll be right back after these messages on K-DIS

[ VERSE 1: Yomo ]
Down here in the ghetto there's a new 33
Shakin and fakin, and just takin
Corrupt, and twist around
A sound that the ghetto found
It's time to step down
R&amp;B usin r-a-p to make cabbage
On the average I gotta start static
Can't sit back, lounge and watch them get paid
Probably with a style I played
Sittin atop the highest limb on the loom
Boom! - while I'm in a man-made tomb
But litte did they know that the axe was sharp, y'all
And Maulkie on the creep with a chainsaw
Set the trap to shake this thang loose
Now on bruise, tighten up the noose
Tryin to survive as mainstream is bull
Playin thick and strong, but can't pull
I ain't goin for it, I ain't even
Get a nudge to budge till it's leavin
Flyin south for a long-ass winter
Stayin south, cause I ain't the beginner
The old soft tale trick ain't real
This is a plot to kill
A mockingbird

[ radio reporter ]
So Mr. Yomo, what do you have to say about R&amp;B sellin out to rap?
[ Yomo ]
Well, you know, we really don't appreciate R&amp;B taking...
[ radio reporter ]
Wait a minute, we'll be right back after these messages...

[ VERSE 2: Maulkie ]
I heard there's a bird that been shakin and schemin
And for a style been fiendin
It's a pree that's known as R&amp;B
And the hunter is a brother named Maulkie
As I scope I peep what they doin
Tryin to speed my process, and ruin
An artform that they claim is a trend
Remember this when you hear my record spin
I ain't a token, flingin a verse or two
Yo, they just wanna exploit you
It's a shame that it's black against black
Now I know where my people's head is at
Stations, claim they're hip-hoppin
I tune in, the rhymes ain't droppin
But it's cool when a singer plays a rap
Check it, Maulkie can't dig that
Sell out, hell no, I won't go R&amp;B
I let the R&amp;B come to me
My angle's laid, amplified to be heard
What it's to kill a mockingbird

[ radio reporter ]
The public would like to know, Mr. Markie
Why are you two attacking R&amp;B?
[ Maulkie ]
Well, we feel it's exploitation of a rare artform, and we are just like...
[ radio reporter ]
Now tell us, what does 'mockingbird' really mean?
[ Maulkie ]
Well if you just let me answer the question...
[ engineer ]
Cut take 5

[ VERSE 3 ]
[ Yomo ]
Now R&amp;B done straight took thangs to the max
Singing over hip-hop tracks
Mockingbird, shockin birds, rockin birds
Gimme the lane, I start clock and verge
Clippin your wings
Straight clippin your wildest dreams
Yeah, that's my theme
Now everybody wants a little nest-egg
How you get a nest-egg without a litte nest?
Guess 
Most of my brothers are like illegal
Can't compare a mockingbird with an eagle
That's what I am when it comes to them and me
That goes the same for Maulkie
[ Maulkie ]
The bird is in the air, and he's hard to hit
Infrared on the brain, I gotta get with him
As he dumps on you and the industry
Nobody cares, it seems, but the Styler
On a mission, me, myself and yo
The suckers gotta go
Gold records and things don't get me off
I get off by schoolin suckers that's soft
Ruthless does the retailin
Like Marley and Tosh, we're just wailin
When we attack, the pigeon plays dumb
So run, little mockingbird, run

[ radio reporter ]
One last question: what's in the future for the both of you?
[ Maulkie ]
Well, in the future for both of us, hopefully we'll be doin some tourin...
[ radio reporter ]
Anyway -
[ Yomo ]
Now wait a damn minute, what the hell you mean: 'anyway'?!
We ain't answered a question from the get-go!
[ radio reporter ]
But -
[ Maulkie ]
But this!
( *scuffle* )
[ Yomo ]
...get em, Mark, get, get...
Yeah, we takin over the station
Yella, kick it</pre>
