[Diamond Shell]
I was walkin down the street a brother bumped me
A really bad way to confront me
So I glared at him he got pissed
He stepped back and started flingin his fists
So I dodged to the left and then went for mine
Reached in my camouflage, and pulled out my nine
.. then Hobbes took a chill
I said, "Freeze black, and stand still
Don't make me do you in the street because I will"
Yo so, at that note he stood still
.. he had his hands up
I coulda killed him but I didn't that's just his luck
I said, "Yo, you got til ten
So turn slow like and start steppin"
So he did as I said, so slow he turned
He took off so fast I smelled the sneakers burn
But the smell from the smoke was his brain
.. in which I branded my name
I am the Diamond Shell, I rock on

I'm in my crib sleepin but I'm still strapped
So I heard a strange noise
and grabbed the nine from underneath my pillow
The nine in my robe, crept down the hall so slow
I see two beautiful girls, robbin all of my dough
I watch them as they move, so smooth like cats
They took the dough, TV VCR and all that
One of the girls I knew, could this all be a joke?
I had to move quick 'fore I wind up broke
So I stepped down the steps and then reached for my gun
They both tried to run but I grabbed one
Her eyes were blood red and packed up with fear
She said it wasn't her plan it was her friends out there
I felt a warm spot in my heart that night
I told her, "Yo you got to piss and you best take flight"
She did as I said, so slow she turned
She took off so fast I smelled the sneakers burn
But the smell from the smoke was her brain
.. in which I branded my name
I am the Diamond Shell

I'm chillin in my crib, the telephone rang
{*BRRRRRRRRRRRRING*} Hello?
A girl around the way, I won't reveal her name
to protect the innocent from a lot of shame
Now before the girl said even two words more
I hung up the telephone and was at her door
I made the first move just to show her who's boss
I kissed her on the mouth with crazy force
I must have turned her on cause she stood right up
Dropped her gear and stood there in her butt
Then she kissed me on my face and then she grabbed my hand
Led me into the bedroom, the promised land
I cleared my head and then I went for broke
I knocked the boots so hard I smelled the sneakers smoke
But the smell from the smoke was her brain
.. in which I branded my name
I am the Diamond Shell, I rock on
.. I rock on
Cause I'm the Diamond Shell, I rock on
