[Lecrae]
For better or for worse
Make it work
I ain't goin nowhere

Yeah, I messed up, but you hurt me, Blew it like it's yo' birthday
And you love it baby on Wednesday, but I make you sick on Thursday
And I know I'm wrong and you shutin down, and I touch down like "What now?"
Why we going through all this? Why things gotta be rough now?
But, you had so many break-ups, you can't believe
You go and break my heart that I forgive and I ain't leave
Don't define you by your faults, ain't gon push your buttons either
Everyday we startin fresh, this is how it's s'posed to be
Never try to take advantage, you respect me as a man
But every once 'a while you get to poppin off and say stuff you shouldn't be sayin
But I'm witchu, I ain't playin, if it's thick or if it's thin
Both the times and your figure, girl, this is who I am
I love you baby, that's real talk, and this life we live is a real walk
I ain't goin nowhere, tell your girlfriends that it's still on
I love you baby, that's real talk, this life we live is a real walk
I ain't goin nowhere, tell your friends that it's on

[Chorus]
For better or for worse
Sometimes I make you sick, and you get on my nerves
Make it work
I ain't goin nowhere, and I give you my word
I will be right here
So though push my buttons
I ain't leavin
You can keep on pushin
I ain't leavin

[Lecrae]
I be makin you mad, girl
But you said you'll never leave me lonely
So I had to put a ring up on it, 'cause our commitment ain't no game
Yeah we laugh, but we ain't playin, I'ma always be yo' mane
And I know sometimes I upset you, be pushin all o' you buttons
We be fussin, fighting over nothin, you can try to leave, but I'm comin
We gon work it out with no runnin, pushin ,shovin
I know sometimes that I'm selfish, but I jump in front of yo' bullet
Cause you everything that prayed fo', plus a little bit extra
Even when you getchu an attitude and you act a little bit extra
Listen, you make better, babe, you make better, babe
You got my heart and you can have it for forever, baby
And though we'll never break up, I hate it when we mad
But love it when we get to make up, no lines that I could make up
To let you know how much I got you covered, girl
And I only be pushin yo' buttons because I love you, girl</pre>
