[Biz Markie]
Everybody just clap your hands {"no stoppin"}
Uptown {"no stoppin"}
Brooklyn {"no stoppin"}
Queens {"no stoppin"}
The Bronx {"no stoppin"}
Long Island {"no stoppin"}
New Jersey {"no stoppin, say no stoppin"}
Yo V, bring it in
Aight, this this a special dedication
To my man DJ Hollywood
Because he was one of the first ones out there
And I-I-I'd like I'd like to sing a little song
A little something like this
To all the ladies out there, this goes out to you now
Check it out

[Verse One: Biz singing]
Ooooh, whoa-whoa
No wayyyyyyyyy, no wayyyyyyyy
For you to stop me now
I'm the kind of guy that could really turn you on
Give you so much lovin, and treat you on
Just hold me close and hold me tight
And let's make love tonight
And I swear to you baby, I'll treat you right
If you're the kind of girl that I've been lookin for
Be real good to me baby, let me be adored
I don't stop the way I'm feelin
Just keep on turnin me on
And I swear to you baby, I'll love you all night long

[Interlude One]
Somebody say well (well) - WELLLLL! (WELLLLL!)
There ain't no way to stop me now, come on
Let me here you say welll (welll) - oh well (oh well)
WELLLLLLL-LLLLLLLL-LLLLLLL

[Verse Two: Biz singing]
Did you ever see a girl, and thought she didn't care
Did you ever feel like cryin, and think you'd get nowhere
Did you ever see her comin, when the lights were down below
Did you ever whisper GOD I LOVE HER, but how much you never know
Did you ever look into her eyes and see a little prayer
Could you sew a spot, flow to her heart
And think that you were there?
Did you ever wonder where she is, or wonder if she's true?
One day you'll be happy
But that next day you'll be blue

[Chorus]
That's why I say well (well) - it feels so good to me
WELLLLL (WELLLLL) - you know just how to set me FREEEEEEE
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
LET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh

Whenever I see her face (where you goin brotherman?)
I take a trip to a beautiful plaaaaaaaaace
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
LET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh

[Interlude Two]
Whenever we're up close
It's your perfume I love the mooooooooooost
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
LET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh

[Verse Three: Biz singing]
When all the other fellas try to run that game on you
I wanna show you baby a love that's true
A love that's good, and a love that's fine
Somethin to blow your mind
Talkin bout a love of the freakiest kind
Because you got eyes like a-water
Lips so rosey red
Everytime I see you really turns my head
And I'm the kind of guy, that love you all for me
And everybody know my name is (BIZ-MAR-KIE)

[Chorus]

[Biz singing]
Say, well, WELLLLLLLLLLLL
Well, well well welll
Well, well, well!
Let me let me turn you on, ooooooooohhhhh
Let me.. let me turn you on
Please baby, let me turn you on
Welll welll welll welll welll welll
Let me let me turn you on, ooooooooohhhhh
Yeah, yeahhhhh
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease
Let me let me turn you on, ooooooooohhhhh</pre>
