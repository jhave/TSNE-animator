Some people tell me that I need help 
Some people can fuck off and go to hell 
God dam why they criticize me 
Now shit is on the rise and my family despise me 
Fuck em and feed em cuz I don't need em 
I won't join em if I can beat em 
They don't understand my logic 
To my gat, to my money, and I'm hook on chronic. 
I never wanted to hurt a nigga 
Unless you come flexing that trigger 
I'll dig ya that grave on the east side of town 
Now your six feet underground 
From man to the dust to the ashes 
All I remember tell me where the cash is! 
Click clack barrel at my dome 
Give all your loot or you ain't going home 
But I ain't going out on a bang 
Wa dada dang wa dada da dang 

(Hook) 

I'm having illusions all this confusion's 
Driving me mad inside 
I'm having illusions all this confusion's 
Fuckin me up in the mind. 

Mother fuckas be driving me up the walls 
Hoping that I fall but they can lick my balls 
Straight jacket strap it 
In the padded room where some punk niggas can't hack it 
Distracted from all reality now I'm let out 
On a minor technicality .... They all fucked up now 
Cuz they let a nigga back on the street some how 
I'm looking for some one like me 
Living in my own world to my own degree 
On the loose in the city looking at the ho with the titties 
Looking at me and I feel shitty 
A lil tensed up getting hot 
Cuz she looks like my girl who got smoked at the crack spot 
I'm trying to find ways to cope 
But I ain't fuckin around with a gage or a rope. 

(Hook) 

I'm having illusions all this confusion's 
Driving me mad inside 
I'm having illusions all this confusion's 
Fuckin me up in the mind. </pre>
