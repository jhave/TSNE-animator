[ E-40 ]
Yeah, fresh up out the Sick Wid It umbrella
You got the M-o-double s-i-eeee
Your boy E-40 Fonzarelli from the C-l-i-c-k
Comin your way
Kaveo and Yeezy Meezy tap that ass
Check it out

[ E-40 ]
I was raised on powdered meat, shackles on my feet
Chowtime, S.O.S. tatoos on my chest
Zoom-zoo-zoom-wam-wam's was self-explanatory
Homies had sob stories, 'man, we doin bad'-stories
Think quick, been a hustler since carriage
Pen pal might want a marriage
Misses - ugh, everybody know my name
Used to - ugh, be a factor in the game
But I - ugh, owe about 10 grand
By the time I touch down I'ma be a old man
So I marinate and wait for the laws to change
Get out and wait for the stock exchange
Fresh off the plane, meet me at the baggage claim
Jackson limousine, holdin up a card with my last name
"Good evening, Stevens, what's upish, watch your tail
The man's around, man, ??? your partner ??? bails"
Ugh

(Nobody can be you but you)  --&gt; Steve Arrington
Cause can't nobody be you but you
(Nobody can be you but you)  
That's right
(Nobody can be you but you)
Cause can't nobody be you but you
(Nobody can be you but you)
That's real
Check it out

[ Kaveo ]
Seen many different things such as homicide
By older folk was passed out game on how to whoride
Laced my boots, schooled me on my ghetto roots
Get inside coupes, four-doors is what they swooped
Cadillacs, no 15's, just 8-tracks
Who's that mackafeezy with the heezys in the back?
Got that sack of Mary Jane and powdered caine
And every word ??I was bein rubbed at?? the game
[ Mugzi ]
Hard time battleship, Chevy mob
.45 pistol grip, "Get a job"
Poppin off at the lip
"That's all you do is eat, sleep and talk shit"
Attendin college so damn difficult
You ??? I was believed to cope
Mannish nada, come down trampolina
??? open down magazina

(Nobody can be you but you) 
Cause can't nobody be you but you, ugh
(Nobody can be you but you)  
That's true, straight true
(Nobody can be you but you)
Cause can't nobody be you but you, ugh
(Nobody can be you but you)
Straight true, straight true

[ Kaveo ]
Keep your butterfly open, never go for the okey-doke
Rope-a-dope and keep your eyes up under the scope
That's what they spoke when I was knee-high to a fly's eye
Listenin to Sly and eatin sweet potato pie
[ Mugzi ]
Ridin high with the whole Click in the club
Just in case the feds wanna plant a dub
Goodness grace, ????
In your face with a ???-sippin mean mug
Spaced, put a N.S.R. in his place
Chase high speeds makes ??? wanna ??? young...
[ Kaveo ]
...dumb niggas get snatched out the spot
Popped for tryin to get what Miss Jones got
Through - fell out the sky without a parachute
Who - is gon' ever save the next fool?
You - better do what you gotta do
Cause can't nobody be you but you

(Nobody can be you but you)
Cause can't nobody be you but you, ugh
Straight true
Can't nobody be you, ugh
(Nobody can be you but you)  
Cause can't nobody be you but you, ugh
(Nobody can be you but you)
Be true, stay true
Can't nobody be you but you, nigga, ugh

Ugh
Yeah
Sick Wid It
40 Fonzarelli
The whole C-l-i-c-k
The whole umbrella
98, 97, 98, 97, bia-bia-bia-biatch

(Nobody can be you but you)
Come on, give it, give it to me
