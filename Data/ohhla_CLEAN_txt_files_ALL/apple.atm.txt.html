Hi, my name is Sean Daley and you might know me from such films as 
"I Can't Sing, But Neither Can You."

Haha yea, heheheh what are you lookin' at?
Don't look at me, don't even talk to me
Oh you rap too? Heheh I should've known
I ca, I can tell. Nah, it's in your eyes

Just cause you're an emcee doesn't mean that you get to be an asshole (asshole)
Just cause you're a man, doesn't mean you get to act like a bitch (like a bitch)
Won't you stand over here do a favor use your head to hold this apple (apple)
And on my twenty pace take, aimin' shots, swear to God I won't miss (I won't miss)
See I've been around the world without moving and I've met a lot of people (people)
And they all play the same little games the only change is the date (is the date)
It's all fame and respect a little money won't you help me build my ego? (ego)
Without taking any time to think about how it might affect fate (checkmate)
You see we've come a long way just to find that there ain't no place to lay down
(break down)
And we waited all night for the light, but the dawn never broke (never broke)
And if we let the song play we can lead all the children to the lake now (take down)
Because it seems as if most would rather choose to sit back and let 'em choke
(don't choke, don't choke)
Just cause you're an emcee doesn't mean that you get to be an asshole (asshole)
Just cause you're a man, doesn't mean you get to act like a bitch (you bitch)
If you stand over here do a favor use your head to hold this apple (apple)
And on my twenty pace take, aimin' shots, swear to God I won't miss (I don't miss)

I ain't gonna say no names..
