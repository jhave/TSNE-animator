[Verse One]
Everybody in the club in the heat
Pussy get to poppin when we holdin the beat
Bitches throwin up they posin hands
Ass keep poppin out these female pants
Every motherfucker sippin on liquor
See the crunker they be gettin when they be drinkin a beer
And they be pullin on a mmoma like, "Bitch come here"
Pullin on a momma like, "Bitch come here~!" {*scream*}
I'm Santa Claus, didn't you hear?
Tell Johnny Saint Dick what you want this year
And we might get it to yo' ass by the summer
Who, Peter Pancakin with a thumper
You, know we crank the club
Black magic in here, so drank it up
And you gon' be just as drunk as us
You gon' be just as drunk as us

[Chorus]
Fin' to take it to the stage - "DRRROP!"
Put it all in the face - "DRRROP!"
Make it flow in the place - "DRRROP!"
'Fore a little buddy gotta bank - "DRRROP!" just to see you
Drop that motherfucker! (Drop that mother-fucker)
Drop that motherfucker! (Drop that mother-fucker)
Drop that motherfucker! (Drop that mother-fucker)
Drop that motherfucker! (Drop that mother-fucker)

[Verse Two]
Now let me put you up on somethin different
All female need to pay attention
I wanna see you gyrate on the flo'
Move your body body like you want this dough
This one right here for the sexy girl
with a two-piece on, go on work it girl
She'll make you keep comin, spendin yo' money
When yo' mind need to be on yo' woman
But the way she move you hypnotized
Now you got pussy all in your eyes
(AY~!) Bartender, bring another round
Tips shorty on the pole, start slidin down {*KA-CHING*}
Fuck it, might as well make it rain
Cause pussy all around you callin yo' name
They know what they got and they know how to use it
(Drop that motherfucker!) To the music

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
When you see her on the flo'
You know, she droppin to the music
(Yup-yup, we like that)
(Yup, yup yup-yup, we like that)
Put it all in yo' face
And still be droppin to the music
(Yup-yup, we like that)
(Yup, yup yup-yup, we like that)
Drop that motherfucker! "DRRROP!" {*"Aww, aww yeah"*}
Drop that motherfucker! "DRRROP!" {*"Aww, aww yeah"*}
{*"Aww, aww yeah"*}

[Verse Three]
Breakin it down and makin your rounds
On my house, see you the baddest bitch in the town
Layin it down, they like the way she screw up the ground (screw up the ground)
Round and around she went
Representin for the rent and the presidents
Hella thick, quick like some instant grits
Boy that's it, hot out the motherfuckin oven
Buzzin, plus she doin the shit that you lovin

[Chorus]

"DRRROP!" {*8X*}</pre>
