Up and down that lonely road of faith 
I have been there 
Unprepared for the storms and the tides that rise 
I've realized one thing, how much I love you 
And it hurts to see, see you cryin' 
I believe we can make it through the winds of change 

God is great indeed 
If you believe, in the everlife 
Yeah we gotta 
Make some sense of the piece that's not defined 
And if you just hold on, I wont let ya fall 
We can make it through the storms and the winds of change 

Though I walk through the valley of darkness 
I am not afraid 
Cause I know I'm not alone 

And if the wind blows east, would you follow me 
And if the wind blows north, would ya stay your course 
And if the wind blows west, would ya second guess 
And if it blows to the south, would you count me out 
And if the sun don't shine, would you still be mine 
And if the sky turns grey, would you walk away 
Would you say I do, if I say I'll be 
And walk this road through life with me 
You know I love youuuuuu 

On this lonely road of faith
