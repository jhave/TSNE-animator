(We were stripped from our land
they took our families and deliberately broke them apart
took the father one place, the mother some place else
and then they had the child whose mind was white
once they indoctrinate him with all this inferiority talk)

(...in Africa with your blood relatives)

(I'm mad as hell and I ain't gonna take no more)

(This business of justice is not new)

No justice
No peace		(2X)

What is the world comin to?
What are we gonna do?
I'm disgusted, so we must get
Ready to become militant rebels
Cause there will never be no peace without justice
I'm tired of my people treated unequal
That's why I'm ( ? ) I gotta face this
So I speak out and those who don't like it, they freak out
And they label me a racist
I'ma keep sparkin, me and brothers like Al Sharpton
We don't like what they did to Yusef Hawkins
Why was the trial prolonged for so long?
They shot him in cold blood, they knew they was dead wrong
Let a brotherman shoot the other man
Nowadays they lock em up in a second and throw the key away
Hold up, you think I fold up? No, I'm geased
Without no justice there'll be no peace

No justice
There will never be...
No peace
Without...
No justice
There will never be...
No peace

See, I'm a programmed warrior, built to last
A Five Percenter who descends from the Lost Tribe of Shabazz
Barin the truth, I'm not scared of ya
Is this the United States or the United Snakes of America?
This is a livin hell and I'm not ( ? )
I refuse to burn in America's melting pot
I'm angry, you can't refrain me, I make em all see
Word is bond it was wrong how they did [Name]
As far as I can see her privacy was exploited
They beat her and raped her, put her in the back of manure
Engraved 'nigger' on the stomach
Up to this day a lot of people think she fronted
Is it a lie or is it incidental?
People who are raped names' supposed to be kept confidential
But she was exploited at a young age, it's such a shame
I never heard the Central Park jogger's name
But straight to the point and on the ball
I be the universal true Son of Man and and a ( ? )
I pity you idiots like Arsenio Hall
Jokes about our sister, he thinks it's funny, y'all
It's sad to see ( ? ) so much as a minor
I'm glad to see the Nation of Sslam refined her
You want peace, well, let the unjust stuff cease
If we don't have justice, there will be no peace

No justice
There will never be...
No peace
Without...
No justice
There will never be...
No peace

Break it down

(I think that the solution rests with the people
it's a mistake to rely on professors
racism is learned
nobody is born a racist
and some people have Ph.D.'s in racism)

The Mighty Maestro created a beat that was lethal
The source to bring forth power to the people
The rhythm was made to be rolled by the host
So I'ma ride the rhythm from New York to the West Coast
Brotherman takin a stand, demandin respect
I'm not with the situation in Teaneck
They said he was dangerous, well, I'm concerned
How could he be so dangerous with his back turned?
They said, "Freeze! Halt!" The brother stopped
Threw his hands in the air, yeah, and still he got shot
They said he had a shiny object in his hand
So they killed the man
And is this justice, no way, José
He didn't get arrested, he was suspended with pay
Talk about armed and dangerous, accounted
How come I never heard nothin else about it?
I'm dead up, I'm goin head up, see, the buck stops
Here, I'm sick and tired of corrupt cops
I gotta drop cause I don't think it will ever stop
My brain is a Tec-9 and it's kept cocked
And it's got just a few more rounds to go
They're goin pound for pound, blow for blow
You want peace, let the unjust stuff cease
If we don't have justice, there'll be no peace

No justice
There will never be...
No peace
Without...
No justice
There will never be...
No peace

No justice
No peace

Peace to Allah's Nation
