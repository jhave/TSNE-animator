[Daz] *screamin in the backgroung*
And the party don't stop

[Usher] - repeat 5X
Tell me what you gone do
What you gone do what you gone do

[Daz Dillinger]
I met her back in high school, used to dig out her homies
She never snitched on me cuz baby was in love
I was all she would dream of all she would think of
She worked nine to five, I rolled up smokin bud
Independent baby loved to live life exqist
From Atlanta G.A. and plus she new how to kick it
She wan't an erotic stripper
Dancin that's where I first met
Sayin' to myself "I gots to go get her"
Waved a hundred doller bill in the air
Said come here baby pulled up a chair
Got you shakin my very dear
That's when I said baby you the one work it the best
I say you the bomb and stuck a five down her chest
Buzzin lovin the scean was all what it seem
For me to get inside her world was all aplayers dream
She picked me up in a six hundreed 
Music bangin and thumpin and the only thing she had to say ha ha

[Chorus 5X: Usher]
How you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you 
This is what you do
Thinkin bout her and the thangs that come long ways
You make me you make me

[Daz - talking over the chorus]
Yea, that's how we be doing it baby
Ain't no fakin over here
Know what I'm sayin
Yea,
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Come chill with you know what I'm sayin
Girl, cheack it out

[Usher]
At this point a situation I controled
I never ment to hurt her 
but I, gotta let her go (gotta let her go)
and she may not understand
While all of this is going on
I try I try to fight but the feelings just to strong

[Daz Dillinger]
She said you Daz what's your fantsay
but you ain't ever had a pieace of pieace of ass like me
and when you get it once baby you can laugh at me
and then she worked it on a player so drastically
Baby got nasty when we least expected
The one who get so drunk and get butt naked
We don't be trippin when we walk inside the club
Chillin like a villain sayin what you thinkin of
Houl, houl tell me what you gone do
What you gone do, what you gone do</pre>
