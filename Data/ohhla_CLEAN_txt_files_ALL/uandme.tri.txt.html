[Chorus]
You and Me
We can make it last
You and me  
We can make it last
You and me
We can make it last
You and me
We can make it last
You and me...

[Verse 1]
It was me and you Trina who shared the hard times
Still in love wit niggas who was serving some hard times
Or involved wit niggas who lost their lives
When Hollywood passed I nearly lost my mind
I then rolled wit the traffickers worked in the Maximas
When D.A in back of us, I'm stretched out nervous
Asking myself, "Bitch was this really worth it?"
What's my purpose I gotta keep searching
It was me and you Trina who asked the same questions
we decided when and which hoes we would fuck it
shop wit thug wit get into some thug shit
turn 'em on to niggas who deep into that thug shit
get money fuck a little let a nigga touch a little
had to make moves our home was so fucking little
Feel that? I know you do, guess what I wrote it too
Please recognize this is a hip hop quoteable

[Chorus] + (over lapping the chorus)
(And even through the loneliest time
 we survived through our loneliest nights
 Just think about the struggling times
 when we survived through a nickel and dime
 And even if I had all the bread in the world
 I'd give it all up for one shot at
 You and Me, I'm that same bitch)

[Verse 2]
You and me were best friends but I'm the one you talk about?
I showed love to everybody before I walked about
the parties the club the function
I leave you bring up discussions on who I'm fucking
You and me were best friends we talked about abortions
As little girls hair braided o the same porches
We promised each other we would share the same losses
Ya baby daddy passed we share the same losses
It was you and me hoe getting c-notes
bell hoppers to the death while Irish hoes deep throat
Yeah it's beef in the air and why she know
If anybody do she know how we flow
Miami bitches you know how we go
Nice entourage lock mints wonder bras
Sit in the club I miss how it was

[Chorus] + (over lapping the chorus)

[Verse 3]
You know it's really funny how the tables turn
I moved forward and thank God for the lessons learned
I used to strip clubs as a stepping stone
Hit the stage got paid it wasn't my second home
Ask somebody Trina been the shit on the streets  
Roll wrap late nights been the shit on the beach
Brought blue baby jeans just to shit on the ?
Keep tall body guys just to sit underneath
Sit back pop bottle ya'll sit on ya'll feet
Screaming my name tryna get in V.I.P
I don't own the club boo
I'm just showing love too
But every time I see ya face I think of me and you
It's disappointing that you fell off well not fell off
I just can't accept you not being well off
It wouldn't be me if I didn't tell all
I even tried to call you but ya cell off

[Chorus] + (over lapping the chorus)</pre>
