[50 Cent]
Yeah, Sha-dy, Aftermath - G-Unit!

[Intro]
Damn baby all I need is a lil' bit
A lil' bit of this, a lil' bit of that
Get it crackin in the club when you hear the shit
Drop it like it's hot, get to whippin that back
Girl shake that thing, yeah work that thing
Let me see it go up, and, down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go round and round

[50 Cent]
I step up in the club I'm like "Who you wit?"
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my click
Yeah I'm young but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch
I ain't tryin to beef, I'm tryin to get my drink on
And my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'ma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'ma get in shorty ear and I'ma let her know

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin and touchin a lil' bit
Get to lickin and {fuckin} a lil' bit

[50 Cent]
This is 50, comin out your ster-e-o
It's hard to tell though cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get, your bitch, she on me dawg
She must, ta heard, about the dough
Now Captain c'mon and Save-a-Hoe
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
#1 on the chart all the time mayne
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like ohh man
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin, party jumpin, I said loud and clear

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Baby you got me feelin right, you heard me?
My momma gone you can spend the night, you heard me?
I ain't playin I'm tryin to {fuck} tonight, you heard me?
Clothes off, face down, ass up, c'mon, ha ha

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
