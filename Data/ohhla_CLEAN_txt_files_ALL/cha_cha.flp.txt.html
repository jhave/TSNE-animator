(Intro / Spliff Star):
Hah...
Rah Digga...
Spliff Star...
Flipmode...
In ya face nigga...
You wanna battle nigga...

(Spliff Star):
Yo, Yo, Yo! 
It's my time to shine and I'm a shine bright
Sodomize the mic 
Get the crowd hype 
Make 'em want to fight
You see the rhymes I construct 
The flows I conduct 
It fucked up the party like somebody got bucked 
Nigga word!
I lays it down flat like a door mat 
Get head in every state wherever I toured at
Spliff ah spliff 
Duh-ty nigga what the undisputed
Counting traps 
Taking trip out the cacilac
Smokin' quan-quan 
Doggie style chicks in the Montreaon
Cracking many bar 
Fuck it 
Nigga grab an Averon
Me Spliff, be the fucking tailor of my fashion
Fuck what niggas think
Watch a nigga turn platinum

(Chorus / Busta Rhymes):
Ya'll niggas wanna get down 
Ya niggas wanna battle
Eh, what ya'll wannna do 
Let's cha cha cha cha cha

Ya'll niggas wanna get down 
Ya niggas wanna battle
Just what ya'll wannna do 
Let's cha cha cha cha cha

Ya'll niggas wanna get down 
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Ya niggas wanna battle 
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Eh what Ya'll wannna do 
Let's cha cha cha cha cha

(Rah Digga):
Digga, Digga 
First name Rahshea
Sweetest person had no idea
Just like that honey flipped three times
With nickles and dime staking rhymes by the eon
Situation around the way with my women
Looking spiffy wit the vendi type linen
Totin' herbals 
We got papers like staples
Marla Marples 
Didn't think I could take you
Confrontation now niggas wanna run up
Trying to flex muscle on a bitch tring to come up 
Rhymes hotter than concrete statues in Eygpt
Roll they ass out like they parapilegic
Boy! I got shit for the brain
You faker than them new heads calling me by my nickname
I shatter an ego quick 
I be that chick
The wrong niggas gonna be round to see that shit

(Chorus / Busta Rhymes):
Ya'll niggas wanna get down 
Ya niggas wanna battle
Eh, what ya'll wannna do 
Let's cha cha cha cha cha

Ya'll niggas wanna get down 
Ya niggas wanna battle
Eh, what ya'll wannna do 
Let's cha cha cha cha cha

Ya'll niggas wanna get down 
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Ya niggas wanna battle 
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Eh, what Ya'll wannna do 
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha


(Baby Sham):
Get the royal blue nab and swing my way 
On some real party shit if you hold your way 
I can hold mine 
You wanna battle blow some lines
Rocks gleam on the top of my wrist 
You want this
Be the same dude that hop on the pubic splits 
You can't hold this 
You jealous cause ya shorty want this
Dig her back out in front of my crib 
Her man staked out
On the rare the cloud sh...shut your mouth
What you chap 'bout, the same shit 
Been on for chris
The style got you twist up 
Walk wit face ice grilled up
Some cat pulled up in a black surburb
Let me move first so I can park my shit on the curb
Ya moves slow get bashed in from Q.B. to Aspen
I'm short for reason 
You spoke and should have passed that
Don't ask my age cause the world made me like that
Blast a hole in ya face soon as my nine cock back

(Chorus / Busta Rhymes):
Ya'll niggas wanna get down 
Ya niggas wanna battle
Eh, what ya'll wannna do 
Let's cha cha cha cha cha

Ya'll niggas wanna get down 
Ya niggas wanna battle
Let's, what ya'll wannna do 
Na cha cha cha cha cha

Ya'll niggas wanna get down 
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Ya niggas wanna battle 
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Eh, what Ya'll wannna do 
Let's cha cha cha cha cha
Cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha
