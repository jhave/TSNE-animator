[Hook: Pimp C]
Everybody rapping like they ballin and they rich
I see 'em in the streets, I ain't believing they shit
Every-everybody rapping like they ballin and they rich
I see 'em in the streets, I ain't believing they shit
Every-everybody rapping like they ballin and they rich
I see 'em in the streets, I ain't believing they shit
If they diamonds ain't shinin and they rollin K steel
While I'm grippin on the grain, sippin lean, and poppin pills
Every...

[Pimp C over Hook]
Check one two, one two, bitch!
I see your lips quivering but I don't hear nothing!
Knalmtalkinbout!?
Man these niggaz is Mr. Magoo man
Uh!!!

[Pimp C]
Everybody wanna be on some "Superfly" shit (shit!)
But I'm the closest thang to Priest that you gon' see bitch!
I'ma pretty yellow nigga, keep my finger on the trigger (trigger!)
Y'all know the scope, Polo FUCK HILFIGER! (fuck Hilfiger!)
I see you niggaz on the slab, ya jewelry lookin funny (uh!)
Y'all ain't seeing no rap or no +Dirty Money+ (Dirty Money!)
I be in the streets lettin my nuts hang (hang!)
Boys wanna 'bang bang', nigga it ain't no main thang (main thang!)
Coward niggaz makin death threats (death threats!)
I leave ya pussy and ya chest wet (wet!)
I ride around in P.A. one deep in a Bentley (uh!)
Bitch if you 'bout it, come and fuck with me (fuck with me!)
But bitch you better bring an arsenal (uh!)
Because if you miss me you ain't gon' make it to the hospital! (bitch!)
And if ya hit me, they gon' kill ya family
Pussy nigga ain't gon' win, bitch do you overstand me?

[Hook]

[Trae]
Everybody actin like they ballin in this bitch
Until a nigga get up outta the drop and simply fallin on that Benz
83's, I'ma swang a swanger, with ice the price of a house
And I'm the truth, muthafuck the rest, look at this 30 in my mouth
You in the presence of a playa, keep yo' cool 'cause I might go off
When I hop out, suicide roaring Gators, fuckin yo' toes off
And I walk with a attitude like, "Fuck them niggaz, they can't see me"
I guess they love to ride my dick 'cause they watchin me like I'm TV
While these niggaz out here rapping and capping 'bout what they got
or be the reason they get punched in the mouth and ran off the block
I ain't gotta say I'm ballin, bitch you see it on my wrist
Grippin grain, VVS on my fist and these haters pissed
They ice don't even shine like the watch that I got
Then again they never seen the size of the rocks that I got
Now getcha mind right, nigga you a simp
Real recognize trill, so I'm fuckin with the Piiimmmppp!!!

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
I ain't believing that... knalmtalkinbout, let's handle business baby!
Yeah... grippin on the grain (you know what it is!)
Geyeah!!

You ain't the truth and I'm talkin to you, ya jewelry sho' actin funny
Get it appraised for less than me when I'm wearin no ice ya dummy!
Better not think ya thinkin of ballin 'cause ya showed up at Johnny
Wrappin them hundreds on top of ones like it's a whole bunch of money
My golds white and sunny, you equivalent with "it depends"
Whether or not you knows the seventy thousand dollar difference
Fix ya lens, getcha spend, ya game been up and still pretend
that ya spend, dividends, don't pretend that yo' whip's a Benz
You talkin 'bout they slang and even got no thang
Niggaz be talkin 'bout they swang and even got no swangs
Spent my broad, leave a complaint, I ain't gon' charge her to the game
Tellin that hoe to release a Visa, then I'ma charge her for a ring
Me and Pimp be ridin candy 'llac, that's a Cadillac my nigga, matter fact
And I sold it to 'em, plus he had a track
So he grabbed the deck and then he added that
Them boys was frontin like they had the stacks
So my nigga told me that they had the Jag
I picked the phone up and I handled that
That's multi-jewelry, let 'em have it back
[Hook] - repeat 'til fade</pre>
