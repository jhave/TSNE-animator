[Verse 1 - G]
We be 6 deep creepin'
In a Deville sittin' up on D's with the suspension squeakin'
Got us some P, runnin' the D's so we gon' smoke this weekend
I'm with my G's, if we got beef, we gon' commense to squeezin'
Bullets commense to skeetin'
Give my whole clique one reason
Why we shouldn't slang crack and cocaine, nigga my pockets weak and
So I'ma bring in everythang, then my G's ain't eatin'
So the result is layin' you down with them Tec-9 bullets skeetin'
That's all we know so that's how we go grab the ski mask for disguisin'
Can't let him see me cause he gon' know me and it'll be too surprisin'
Fuck this nigga cause I'm ridin'
Tryin' to come up so quickly
No time to stall, lickin' 'em all, got a whole team that's strictly
Ready to ball, stand up tall and they all move so swiftly
Them niggaz ain't scared, they do it for bread
See they gon' come go with me
Bustin' up heads and lettin' loose lead
And what do yo rhyme even matter
After you licked you ain't worth shit we get what we got and we scatter
Back to the crib, divide this here, my pockets is gettin' fatter
Yours getting flatter
When you heard the glass shatter
That means me and my niggaz done gathered
Now you bout to feel the wrath of
Somethin' that you wished you hadn't of
And all I can say is back up because I'm bout to act up
I get the stash from the back from the move
I got a good alibi we could use
We took the dead bodies off in the pool
And put the gloves that we used in the stool
Shit, you gon' have to flush that too
Make sure that you see what you do
Cause if the PIG find out then we through
Then it's off to the County for a few
But that's not how the story is told
Shit, one of us gon' have to go
Cause if them PIG's find out that we stole
We gon' have to bust back at them hoes
So get yo glock ready to reload
Haul ass real fast not slow
Cause on the block is 3rd patrol and they'll beat ya till yo body swole
We need to find somewhere to hide this dough
Shit, what about behind the school
We can come get it later on man just wait for the spot to cool
Got back get the money any way
Split it up, give them niggaz about a eighth
I hid a couple G's down by the lake
Hell yeah I got 'em but they'll be straight

[Verse 2 - Pimp]
We be 6 deep creepin'
In a Deville sittin' up on D's with the suspension squeakin'
Got us some P, runnin' them D's so we gon' smoke this weekend
I'm with my G's, if we got beef, we gon' commense to squeezin'
Bullets commense to skeetin'
Give my whole clique one reason
Why we shouldn't ride a car full of ki's, we got children we feedin'
Comin' from Texas through New Orleans it gets thin and I'm lickin'
Mack 'em and leave, they gotta eat, either it's grindin' or pimpin'
Never get caught slippin'
Need a Cadillac to dip in
Do you niggaz wanna pitch in on a gallon of beer or hard gin
Getting drunk before we start lickin'
I know a nigga we can hit for 10 10 ki's in his grandma den
The back door finna get kicked in
It's another way we can get in
Cut the roof cause it's made out of tin
4 niggaz jumpin' out the shit then
2 niggaz in the car waitin'
Pitch black so we can't see in
Get off my hip nigga stop pushin'
We get caught, we goin' straight to the Pen
One fluke, then we all turned in
Getting life for this Devilish sin
Move slow nigga so we can hear 'em
Where the flashlight so we can see 'em
If they woke then we gon' have to kill 'em
That ain't the reason my folks came here
The old lady came out on the porch
Took her in the house, sit on the flo'
Man, what you came out here fo'
Now I'm gon' have to tie you with rope
We hit the safe then we up out the do'
We done got what we came here fo'
Crank up the car, move nigga, let's go
I here (Whhooop!!) nigga there go the folks
Move slow, cut the clutch, let's roll
I grab the dough then I hit the back road
I was high but now it's low man somethin' told me to kill that hoe
Runnin' through the woods, my feet got so'
Too damn dark, don't know where to go
Smelled barbecue by Cassy's store
Hit the train track by Smiley Co.
Tryin' to get to my grandma's house
Way on Goode Street, man that's out
We 6 Deep, we look suspicious, man we need to spread out
Me and T runnin' side by side
Me and he, both of us so tired
Fly wide open through Cedar Park tryin' to see if we can find us a ride
Ain't nobody standin' outside
Whole damn neighborhood too quiet
See the police so we still tryin' to hide
Cross Mobley Highway when they ride by
I  need somethin' I can try
I  see a nigga right now
Standin' up at Domino's waitin' for his food outside
We  took that niggaz Caprice
We  took that niggaz supreme
Large pepperoni pizza, ham with extra cheese
If I'm liein' bitch I'm flyin'
We full plus we ridin'
10 Ki's in the trunk headed straight to Riverside
It's time to get real shiesty now
A bag with 10 bricks
Me and G hid 4 and split 6 with the clique
Now we 2 deep creepin'
In a Caprice sittin' up on D's with his music beatin'
Got us a trunk full of them Ki's so we gon' cook this weekend
Bustin' them Ki's down to O-Z's cause it's cocaine season
So don't get caught sleepin'
We be 2 deep creepin'
In a Caprice sittin' up on D's with his music beatin'
Got us a trunk full of them Ki's, we gon' cook this weekend
Bustin' them Ki's down to O-Z's cause it's cocaine season
So don't get caught sleepin'</pre>
