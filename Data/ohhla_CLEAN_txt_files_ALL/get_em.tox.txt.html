[Sammy Sam]
I bet'cha wont hit a mother fucker,
Hit 'em, hit 'em
If a nigga disrespect get 'em
Nigga mob up like the Mafia
Ain't no stoppin' us we can swab up
Mafia, they ain't fuckin' with us
Without an Big Oomp alert,

Every kind of Whichway we hit 'em, we shot 'em!

[Shawty Beezelee]
Ridin' down Simpson with the Cadilac wood grain,
First phase, phase two, finna hit it up mane,
Real players from the South, ride triple G mane,
This is how we do it cut 'em up on the free way
Loko wanna swerve on me, put it up mane,
Fleetwood Big Body, with the dubs mane,
Comin' with them flows, fully Major,
This is how we do it in the ATL so,

[Chorus-2x]

I break yo back and bust yo skull to the white meat,

Try'na hang with a playa, try'na smoke my dank,

Gangsta Boo where dem dollars at? I got to get 'em
