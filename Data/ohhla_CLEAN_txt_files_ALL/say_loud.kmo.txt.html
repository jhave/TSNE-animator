(Ugh!)	--&gt; James Brown

(Ugh!)

Some say we got a lot of malice
Some say we got a lot of nerve
But I say we can't quit fighting
Until we get what we deserve
Just as sure as it takes two eyes to make a pair
Brother, we can't quit
Until we get our share
Come on

Say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
Say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
Come on, say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
(Louder!)
Say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)

Now I worked on jobs
With my feet and my hands
And all the work I did
Was for the other man
We demand a chance
To do things for ourselves
We're tired of beating our heads against the wall
And workin for someone else
Come on

Say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
Say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
Everybody, say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
(Louder!)
Say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)

And yes y'all
Rise and shine
Brothers and sisters, it's that time
As the modern day prophets speak in rhythm and rhyme
Under the influence of the benign
Our rise as the weakest decline
So stick together and keep a positive mind
And sing this song one more time

Come on

Say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
Everybody say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
Brothers and sisters, say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
(Louder!)
Say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)

Now we been whipped, chained
Beaten and scorned
We been treated bad
From Knowledge to Born
Now we've got African Pride
That runs deep as the Seven Seas
We'd rather die on our feet
Than keep living on our knees
Come on

Say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
Say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
Say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
Say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)

This ain't the sound that you hear
It's gonna be music to your ear
You have no fear
Cause God is here
As the righteous get it in gear
And the wicked step to the rear
You're outta here

Feel the power in the rhythm
As our souls move vocally
Come together in a montage
A collage of harmony
Spirits manifest in our voices
As our hearts provide the beat
For a source of inspiration
When we speak in unity
Though it seems like it's a dream
This is as real as it gets
Controlling your environment
Through chanting your concept
Breathing life into lyrics
You can hear it, loud and clear
You can almost see the spirit
From vibrations that you hear
I'm a brother of color descent
From the mother continent
And I been sent with the intent
To rectify the hell-bent
From the line of the devine 
Of those way before my time
Like a star I'm chosen to shine
As the God of Rhythm and Rhyme
Comin strictly from an Afrocentric point of view
I talk to you in a tongue that relates to the young
And if you can't relate, it ain't meant for you
This is strictly for the restoration of pride and enterprise
Esoteric knowledge - essential to our rise
Come on

(I'm African proud!)
He-he-he-he...
(I'm African proud!)
Come on, say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)
(Louder!)
Say it loud!
(I'm African proud!)

(Ugh!)</pre>
