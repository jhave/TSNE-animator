[Chorus]
Slow motion for me, Slow motion for me, Move it(Three-wheeling)
I like it like that, she working that back I don't know how to act(2x)

Me and my girl got this thang going on
Every time we hit the block and get are roll on
She be fully hooked up, Turning heads and necks
Mo niggaz and latinos on her then county checks
Especially when the relatives and cousins come around
Paparazzi get to popping its a buzz around town
The downiest bitch I every had
Niggaz call her hot motherfucker, I call her fifty-seven rag
We be swanging city to city, off the sticky icky
Drinking dark coming through slow motion at the park
thirteen's feet on deck, ass so wide
watch her front back and side to side
Like Uh

[Chorus]

My girl talk to my girl, a freak with sixteen batteries
And a gang of bitches in her family
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty-three, sixty-four
Niggaz be pimping paying like hoes
A dime piece with switches, fully stacked in the romp
She a stallion, she hit the block with pumps
In all the beauty contest, she keep stealing
The way she be seesawing pancaking and three wheeling
Some like her with a candy, some with a pearl
Me I like her longer with a five twenty swirl
Im a ghetto rich nigga so I stay dropping cash
She high maintance I be gorilla hopping her ass
Like an erection I make her stand up
When a gang of niggaz whistling throwing they hands up
Fuck the american dream, its the ghetto nigga dream
So street niggaz hit the switch and sing the ghetto theme

[Chorus]</pre>
