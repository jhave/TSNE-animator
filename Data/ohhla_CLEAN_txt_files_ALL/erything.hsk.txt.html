[Sean Price]
Yo, Malcolm X before we converted to Islam
House burglar, wake up and your shit gone
My life is a movie, better yet a sitcom
Planet of the Apes, I blam the cannon in ya face, P!
Overstand the underhanded ways of Sean P.
Set trap, get clapped like the nigga on Saw 3
Dirty Harry gun, the four-four clap strong
Put a hole in you, in your bullshit rap song
I, man, my flow is so spectacular
That moms, you mad, be wishing I go back to Africa
Hah, joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
Like I smoke my coke in a cig, you dig?
P, I be the first to burst the heat clown
Wrong mask niggas catch a universal beatdown
Sean is the best
You ain't a close second peep the bronze on his neck, bitch

[Chorus]

[Rock]
The black rap Lurch, true
Real tall, real deep voice and I serve you
You rang? Bang, patience ain't only a virtue
That's you and your mans at the hospital, I will hurt you
Beat you out your shirt and your shoes, punch ya chin off
But a pound put your face on your chest like Rick Ross
Bitch boy, you nigga Jill Scott anyway
Gun clear the lane, like Proactive clear Diddy face
You beefing, but you vegan when it's about to cook
Time to ride, your bitch ass in the mirror, like 'how I look?'
Like a God damn snitch, like a clown
Like you bout to go tell on somebody right damn now!
What you told 'em son? Overstand your underhanded ways
Understand my overhand right'll break his face
I seen ya posters, they a waste of space
This shit look like it suck like Macy Gray
I like Macy Gray, but ignorance is what ya'll like, bar fights and shit

[Chorus]</pre>
