[Freck Billionaire]
I'm gettin money is my explanation
The lambo's milked out, No expiration (haha)
And I ain't ask for a estimation
I just pass the cake off, No hesitation
Ya see I'm nothin like ya'll guys
I just do the stuntin, Ya'll niggas fall guys
And everyday I get the benny wash
It's Deja Vu like Denny Wash
Budget too big, Billionaire a hurt a label
Play it tight, Spray the creed on the purple label
Pave settings, Jacob got me linked up
The Bentley wag bulletproof like a Brinks truck
C.B.L, We don't care what ya homies sell
Rubberband 'round the stacks like a ponytail
I could meet a hoe sweeter than Damita Joe
She act conceited tho (what), her numba get deleted yo
I'm not a musician, But I play an instrument
The ragin bull handle any kind of incident
The black latex, D's can't get the print
The flyin spur so fly, I had to get the Bent
Got initails on the door scrap (what else), Initials on the floor mat (what else)
I ain't braggin homeboy, this my format
The 22's look like they ridin on 4 flats
Young octopus, I carry arms I charter challengers
With cavali carry-ons Freck the Billionaire
I'm the 1 with the bling
Got canaries on the wrist, not the ones with the wings look
A real hood nigga, I got a lavish flow
I could put you in the theaters like Magic though
You don't want beef, You just want raps
I get ya lil ass smoked like a blunt wrap
C.B.L spray, What da fuck did you thought
I tote the cig, But I don't mean Newport
I wash my money up the laundry way
I stay Gucci down even on my laundry day
The linen clean, Splash ya grenadine
Double blue 62 smash ya limousine
You could set trip, But I got the ammo near
Like a bad alibi, switchin up the Lambo gears
These other rap niggas, They couldn't hold a candle near 
They got it all screwed up, lLike chandeliers

[Fabolous]
I'm gettin money is my quotation
Family man, so I need the Lambo station
Slick talk will put a chamber into rotation
Director style, I shoot em on location
My hoe's hatian, trini and croatian
Ass clap louder than an Oprah ovation
Double D's on her chest like Daredevil
Her shoe game's at a $900 a pair level
I'm in P-RADA, The color of Ricotta Cheese
Please you can't tell me nada I don't share keys
Nor do I give her codes
I set run through records down on river road
Then I switched up, posted on Palisade
The Denali stay, Smellin like Cali grade
I come through a couple bar, Numba 9 squirts
Osama rich, That's the hard to find shirt
Ya rocks keep 2 they selves, well mines flirt
They 2 clean, Board of Health couldn't find dirt
I'm rich bitch, And I'm screamnin it like ashy larry 
They call me Brinks boy, Maybe it's The cash I carry
Rubberbands pop, you gon need a scrungee for me
if She a jump off, Bet the chick a bungee for me
I came a long way, And I still stroll the avenues
Move and style, Louis V roll and travel
Local nigga, You never been to Poland have you
So you couldn't judge me if you was holdin gavels
And I used to get the raw from Bolivia
That was back when Raven Symone was Olivia
I did the take-out, meanin that I ran orders
I had the transporter sittin by the land borders
The rocafella a make you rather do a manslaughter
They goin in juniors, comin home with grand-daughters
So homie if you got a weapon tote it
You can't jump ship, niggas won't accept and vote it
When I was doin it 4 TV, I kept it loaded
Cause these hatin niggas try 2 final episode it
A half of clip in ya hip, will make ya Elvis shake
You'll more then moan when the bones and ya pelvis break
Bentley drop cost two hundred and twelve to take
Red gut, White paint, Red velvet cake (Yessss)

[Fabolous talking]
Now that's what you call getting ya cake and eatin it to
Hahaha</pre>
