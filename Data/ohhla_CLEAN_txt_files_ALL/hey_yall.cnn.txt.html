(INTRO) Capone (Noreaga)
CNN won y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)
CNN won y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)
CNN won y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)

(Verse 1: Noreaga)
My ice go bling, when you see my shine
And Flex got us spinnin joints like seven times
Chicks look at they ass, then look at they tits
Thinkin it's they turn they know I'm rich
I like a hood rat make a hood book of my bitch
Ay yo she get what she get don't ask for shit
And I told y'all niggaz that I bust to the sceddene
Y'all niggaz is wack like the cops solid cuisine
Fuck that yo, all them niggaz is straight wack
Blow holes through they chest slugs go through they back
And what got me mad is that I really wanna dump off
I say M.U. see if y'all wanna dump off
I was a little kid when I went up north
But now I'm grown an, I got a benz and a land
And hoes wanna give me head right in front of my mans
And when I got the plan I stay wit fams
While y'all coke head niggaz still sniff on grams

Chorus: Capone (Noreaga)
CNN won y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)
CNN won y'all (Hey y'all)
Hey y'all, hey y'all (Hey y'all)

(Verse 2: Capone)
Yo, yo, yo,
Now first of all I'ma send this out to y'all the thug niggaz who brawl
Playin in halls making cellular calls
On a run from the laws wit a gat in they claws
Wit a pack in they draws
I ain't even threw the cracks in they paws
Bang Bang we love to settle the score
Shift from me in the fourth these guys is ready for war
I say the kingdom of the fame once more we reclaim
Either a cop, slug or twenty thou threw on a chain
Niggaz simplistic I been flipped it pumped through blizzards
Clutched the gun on my hip, survival of the fittest
I runt this shit like business
C.E.O. crack merchants tell me when it's dark like guiness
Fly son'll do I run a few
Piss on the world we number one, you shitty niggaz still number two
Gunnin you down bitch you frontin you
Like "Oh shit" tried to run, I put one in her too

(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Algado Shoballoti)
Ay yo,
Now holla at me like hey y'all
We let it spray y'all
Front and y'all pay fall
Tried to flip the game like an eight ball
You speedin
I got the guts to pace y'all
Haters they ain't lovin you
I'm trying to live comfortable
Fuck it like Cliff Huckstable
Gettin cash what a thug'll do
Fuck hoes and never call once so they could never call me a bugaboo
I reign from the sky to the concrete under you
My team known to break beats, pussy and mugs too
I'm down where the crips play criddaps
And bloods scream bliddap
CNN fall back let us get that
We get your kids kidnapped
If its feed back be like that man from cuba beggin for your seed back
And if you don't see me wit CNN or F.C.
Thats like the hood with nobody named Wise or Kiki
And my mics sound nice next to Joe Twenty
We snatch you right up out yo fake fendi, hey y'all

(Chorus)</pre>
