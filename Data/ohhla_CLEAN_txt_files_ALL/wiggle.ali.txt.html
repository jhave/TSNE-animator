[Chorus: Nelly]
Oh, baby girl like to shake a lot, wiggle wiggle
do your thug thizzle we'll make it   
Oh, baby girl like to shake a lot, wiggle wiggle
do your thug thizzle we'll make it
Oh, baby girl like to shake a lot, wiggle wiggle
do your thug thizzle we'll make it
Oh, baby girl like to shake a lot, wiggle wiggle
do your thug thizzle we'll make it

[Verse 1: Kyjuan]
I really hate to see her leave but I love to see her walk off
Imagine what her *oooo* looks like with her clothes off
I'm rolling with the top off, see tops come off
When the streetlights go off I heard shots go off
I'm a humble show-off I'll be beating when I roll off
Pumping Jill Scott number seven in front of the seven-eleven
Grab some magnum protection gonna be some sexin'
Wrap some hemp and L's its gonna be a session
She stressing the fact that we gotta stay at the best western
I ain't cheap and that's on everything   
Put her pants to her knees don't take off everything
I pay for her chains staying near her cain's   
Sipping on her cane I'm forgetting everything
My name Kyjuan, yeah Kyjuan left none
Boy she wouldn't have been with me if you wouldn't have left her
I left her sexed her stressed her and left her

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
My sex steno cus I'm taxing it I smack it a little
Stir it up like mother fuckin coffee then back to the middle
Lift over some pounds some way my hitters nod away   
You damn near caught a Charlie-horse to make your dick stay in the hole
Oh we fuckin now pumping like all my pow
Ass up face down I'm going to town
Round and round here I go pumping for nothing
Cus she wiggle and wiggle and wiggle just know when I'm coming
I'm like *Ohhhh* I can't take it no more
Move it one more time and watch my knees buckle
She tip drip type quit to get her dirty, hype, and aroused
Always see her nipples through her blouse *Owwww*   
Watch it wiggle just like the Harlem dance
Look at all that ass in those *itty-bitty* pants
Damn, hey Ms. Parker I make that ass come on down like Bob Barker

[Verse 3: Nelly]
Baby girl shake it like a paraplegic please believe it (Wooo)
Knees bent, and back arched just how I need it
Call her "Billie Jean," I like the "Thriller" before I "Beat It"
Conceded when she shake it but I like it like that
Throw it at me even harder just to see me react
See if it's wack, in fact see what Nelly about
I thought that ass was a fluke until I went to her house
You see mama got ass too, her sister Keesha and Sue
Her cousins, aunts and nieces start walking in by two
Like who's trying to keep they composure now
I'm feeling it can't nobody hold me down
Nobody told me how crazy groupies and coochies can get
In the back side under the stage trying to hit
And I'm like "Baby girl I ain't that kind of guy"
Let me at least let me go get a condom I ain't trying to die
I might be high but I'm not that damn high!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Ali]
Oh lord my dick hard call the nurse (why?)
It's getting worse fat asses I gotta flirt
It was me Mo and Murph, Kyjuan was with his earth
Playing pussy it hurt, smoking, passing the smirks
Popping bottle after bottle I'm like "Here we go again"
Posting it up in the club thinking "Is he got a win"
My chrome shoes went from Barry to Larry Hughes
Emmitt's 22's now its Jordan's I cruise
But anyway Fo Sho I'm from the show me let me show you
To drunk and out of town trying to kiss you like I know you
In the middle of the dance floor caught the man's attention
Wiggle Wiggle do your thug's hydraulic suspension
Did I mention long Ohhh, "What the fuck is going on?"
Your body banging ma' I got to take you home
Cool lets break, to the house on the lake
Man this is great I'm dealing with high stakes

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
