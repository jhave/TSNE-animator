[Verse One: Lockness Monster]
They like Lockness Monster man who that nigga?!

Hundred percent hip hop and i'm the truth ass nigga
And I go harder in the booth better than you ass nigga

Tried to rhyme most days fam I boo at niggas
Then George Bush a motherfucker throw my shoe at niggas
Sick of these lames I ain't got nothin to do ass niggas
