Uh, uh
I'm bout to freak this
Ha, ha, ha, ha
What? What? What? What?
Uh, Big Will, uh I'm bout to freak this
What you want me to freak this&gt;
Just peep it while I freak this,
Aight, aight

I'm bout to freak this full out the king of the hill
Big Will keepin' it real knees in da grill
The whole set all locked down, making you flock down,
Where I'm at they here my rap,
I be that cat to set trends
Where y'all at
On the corner with your friends
Heard you screamin about cream in your rap kid
Yo my last check for Wild Wild West came on a flat bed
Once and for all lets get this straight
How you measure a rapper what make an MC great
Is it the sales? 20 mill
Is it the cars? Bentley's
Is it the women? Jada
Is it the money? Please
Mr. Clean yet the fact remain
Got girls that don't speak English screamin' my name
All you rappers yellin' bout who you put in a hearse
Do me a favor write one verse without a curse

I'm bout to freak this (yeah, yeah)
What you want me to freak this? (yeah, yeah)
Don't sleep I'mma freak this (yeah, yeah)
Yo it's smooth when I freak this (yeah, yeah)

I don't wanna see y'all sittin around
Don't wanna see y'all sittin around
I don't wanna see y'all sittin around
Don't wanna see y'all sittin around

Aight one more gain deja vu
Up the chart yo y'all see the way I flew
Can't nobody do this the way I do
You like how I freaky freak this say I do (I do)
Haters sick of the hits like the witch of the west nobody wicked as this
I read in Rap Pages they refer to me as soft
Yeah, more like Microsoft
Will Gates of the rap game
Quintessential mega maniac what's my rap name
Big Will I'm the man
Not conceded I'm as good as I say I am
Dang, diggy, dang, da-dang, da-dang, diggy, diggy
Back with the Trackmasters
The bang, jiggy, jiggy
Yo, every time I shoot I score
So many awards I can start Grammy chess board

I'm bout to freak this (yeah, yeah)
What you want me to freak this? (yeah, yeah)

Uh I'm bout to freak this
I'm bout to freak this
I'm bout to freak this
Tone and Poke lace tha track
I lace the rap, Jeff do the cut
Yeah what, Rob do the mix, tape to JL
Then Tommy Mattola put it on sell
Then come da moment of truth
Hot off the press to the DJ booth
(Ay yo here it comes y'all that brand new Will Smith cut)
As soon as it drop watch the phones blow up!
BOOM then ship a mill
Quick to the store
What sold out?
When y'all gettin more
Finally get it, bump the track
Then come the multi-platinum plaque
Now I'm gonna leave it up to you
I bang the hits out just for you
And then my dream come true
(This year's American Music Award goes to)
