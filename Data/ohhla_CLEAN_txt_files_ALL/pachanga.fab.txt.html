Uh, uh, uh
Yeah
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Chorus - Fabolous]
A thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, Pachanga
P-P-P-P-P-P-P-Pachanga , P-P-P-P-P-P-Pachanga

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Yo everything ain't love love, 'cause if it is
My definition of love must differ his
I mean every friendship has its differences (yeah)
But these Young Bucks remind me of Fif' and his (damn)
They hear the good life, wanna see what the difference is (okay)
Some just wanna smoke, enjoy the piff-leges (haha)
He unwrap a cigar like it's a gift of his
He a funny little nigga like Eddie Griffin is (what?)
Between smokin and jokin then you got to live (uh huh)
So I gave him a chance and that's a lot to give
You 'posed to make the most of what you was paid to gross
I gave you bread and butter you supposed to make the toast
Fifteen years, FIFTEEN YEARS!
And now when we say "what's up?", the shit seem weird (so weird)
But there's a question I prepared for you (what's that?)
How could you fuck the only people who ever cared for you?
A thug changes

[Chorus - Fabolous] - 2X
A thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, Pachanga
P-P-Pachanga, P-P-Pachanga

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
There's a parallel path 'tween friends and enemies (uh huh)
And whenever you cross it you make frienemies (uh huh)
There's no remedies for these sick memories
My doctor said there's no cure for the Emilys (damn)
Had a +Crush On You+, now we Kim and Cease
We don't even talk no more, it's no Biggie
I was so Biggie, you was Faith
I let you slide in my home, you was safe
I thought my ability to provide you stability
Was what was really G, okay silly me (silly me)
I was Billy Dee, smooth cat but really street
Really she attract niggaz like the +A Milli+ beat
And I happen to rap but somethin 'bout this beat strange
Soon as I try to flow with it, the beat change
Never thought she change (never)
But what you thinks a upgrade really just could be a seat change
Love changes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
See when the love is gone then it's just B.S. left
Just niggaz with chains on tryin to be S.F.
That's when your ace boom coom ya B.F.F.
Who Pachange ya like they was a P.F. chef
+D-D-D-Danger+, it just feels Mystikal
I miss the cool nights sittin in the Carlo
Now it's like "boooo" we sittin in Apollo
It used to be all good, then shit just went malo
And that's bad, matter fact that's sad
'Cause when you lose a friend it's hard to handle the loss
They do some bitch shit, gotta give ya man a divorce
End up watchin "Friends" like Joey, Chandler and Ross
Ya see, most of these niggaz ain't never love 'em (never love 'em)
And these bitches just think whatever of 'em (whatever of 'em)
So maybe playin dumb was kinda clever of 'em
And less friends are your best friends become strangers
