Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Standin' on the couches blowin' on some ounces
Shit from out the country can't even pronounce it
Another 100k I got that all from tourin'
Throw it in the air just to let em know I'm ballin'
Get the hotel treat it like its residential
Classic wit no diamonds in my presidential
Take a look at me and you can tell I'm paid
Makin all these faces no stevie j
Smokin weed, my hoodie and my leather on
I got a mill just need some shit to bet it on
I got some tree to smoke so they gone let us burn
The waitress bringin bottles I'm just yellin church
Standin' on the couches blowin' on some grass
These niggas talkin' shit but hate will never last
Look at my section vip we showin class
Kush in every joint pierre jouet in every glass

[Chorus]
You know I'm about that shit
Niggas hatin every day thats why they doubt that shit
If we smokin need a ounce of that shit
And I never ever leave the crib without that shit
You know I'm about that shit
Niggas hatin every day thats why they doubt that shit
If we smokin need a ounce of that shit
And I never ever leave the crib without that shit

[Verse 2]
You know I'm about that
Ain't never worried bout fallin off cuz I'ma bounce back
Uh, where yo ounce at?
You talkin bout yo fuckin car but where house at?
Yea, I'm gettin cheese thoe
Walk up in the club they treat me like I'm nino
Uh, sippin moet
Got a couple cars that I ain't even drove yet
Yea, wheres the champaign?
Told my jeweler put some diamonds in my damn ring
Club lookin dry make it rain for em
Face another drink call that a brainstorm
Tatted from my feet up, vip we meet up
Gotta pour some liquor, gotta roll some weed up
Then feel are face we get are plates and eat up
Keep bringin ace this ain't a race but if it was we'd be first place

[Chorus]
You know I'm about that shit
Niggas hatin every day thats why they doubt that shit
If we smokin need a ounce of that shit
And I never ever leave the crib without that shit</pre>
