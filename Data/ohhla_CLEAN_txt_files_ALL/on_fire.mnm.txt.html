Yeah, haha
You know, critics man
Critics never got nothin' nice to say man
You know the one thing I notice about critics man
Is, critics never ask me how my day went
Well I'ma tell 'em

Ah, yesterday my dog died
I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blow up try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog, try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole 
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the 'dro
Better hold on a little tighter here I go
Flow's tighter, hot-headed his ghost writer
Cold-hearted it's Spider-Man throwin' a spider in the snow
So you better get, lower than Flo Rida 
Inside of a low rider with no tires in a hole 
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the ho's?
Listen dog, Christmas is off
This is as soft as it gets, this isn't golf
This is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt
So get lost, shit dissin' me is just like pissin' off
The Wizard of Oz, wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it grab the scissors and saws and
Cut out your livers, gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with Jaws
So sip piss like Sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tas-ted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

You're on fire
That's how you know you're on a roll
Cause when you're hot it's like your burnin' up, everyone else is cold
You're on fire
Man I'm so fucking sick I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
You're on fire
You need to stop, drop and roll 
Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip hop shop to blow
You're on fire (yeah)
You're on fire

I just put a bullshit hook in between two
Long ass verses if you mistook this for a song look
This ain't a song it's a warning to Brooke
Hogan and David Cook that the crook
Just took over so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writin' and kill it
I'm lighting in the skillet, you're a fucking a flash in the pan
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease 
Splashing the fan, Mr. Mathers is the man 
Yeah, I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in the can
Come back and whoop your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulphuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic so for you to think that you could stand
A fucking chance is asinine, yeah ask Denaun man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him 
Color inside the lines or get hit with a flyin' crayon, 
Fuck it I ain't playin', pull up in a van 
And hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'
"Vietnam Vet", I'm out my fuckin' mind man
Kick over the can, beat his ass and leave him nine grand
So if I seem a little mean to you, this ain't savage you ain't never seen a brew
You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke on a piece of fuckin' corn-and-peanut-poo
Sayin' you sick, quit playin' you prick
Don't nobody care, and why the FUCK am I yelling at air?
I ain't even talkin' to no one cause ain't nobody there
And nobody'll fucking test me because these ho's wont even dare
I'm wasting punch lines, but I got so many to spare
I just thought up another one that might go here
Nah, don't waste it, save it psycho, yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair 

You're on fire
That's how you know you're on a roll
Cause when you're hot it's like your burnin' up, everyone else is cold
You're on fire
Man I'm so, I'm so hot my motherfucking fire truck's on fire homies
You're on fire
You need to stop, drop and roll 
Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip hop shop to blow
You're on fire (Yeah)
You're on fire (Oh, shit)
You're on fire</pre>
