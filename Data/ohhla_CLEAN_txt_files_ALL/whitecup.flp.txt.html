[Lil' Flip talking]
I keep a white cup nigga
It's Fliperachi
a.k.a. Mr. I Can Do Dat, a.k.a. The Number One Fly Boy
a.k.a. I Ain't No Sony No More

[Verse 1 - Lil' Flip]
Hey, I keep a white cup
I gotta get my lean on (lean on)
I got a fucked up attitude once all my green gone (green gone?)
Gotta put my jeans on (jeans on)
Gotta put my rings on (rings on)
Hit the button, crank the motor, and put my screens on
Shorty P roll the dro
Damn you see them hoes?! (you see them hoes?)
I don't know where they 'bout to go, but shit I wanna go
Before the show I pour a four and then I mix it up (mix it up)
I take a old school car, then I fix it up

[Hook]
I gotta (I gotta)
White, white, white cup
You see my (you see my)
White, white, white cup
I keep my
White, white, white cup
I love my
White, white, white cup
Now let's drink niggggggaaaaa
White, white cup in my hand
I gotta  (I gotta)
White, white cup in my hand
You see my (you see my)
White, white cup in my hand
I keep my (I keep my)
White, white cup in my hand
Now let's drink nigggggaaaaa

[Verse 2 - Lil' Flip]
I never lie to my fans not one time
These niggas wanna hit the cup, but ain't drop one dime
What kind of shit is that?
Nigga I'm sippin' that
And on my lap is my strap
That's where my weapon at
Come get it, you want it, you know I got my heat on me
Come get it, you want it, you know I got them keys homie
They go on cheap homie, they on the streets homie
I'm a gangsta so I never run from beef homie
I'm sippin', flippin', grippin' woodgrain as I roll (roll)
I few platinum chains, but I love gold
I like the way it shine, I like the way it glisten (glisten)
I got the real drank, you niggas need to listen

[Hook] w/ Mike Jones ad libs
Ayyyyyeeeee
Ayyyyyeeeee
Say Flip
Let your boy Mike Jones get some of that purple stuff in this white cup nigga
Hahaaaa
Hahaaaa

[Verse 3 - Mike Jones]
I stay iced up
I gotta get my bling on
A million buzz plus before I put my ring on
Before my ringtones
I was gettin' my green on
I told Flip pour me a four to get my lean on
Pass me that Sunkist
Pass me that purple stuff
One hand on woodgrain the other on that white cup
Mike Jones and Fliperachi
Ain't no one like us
I'm rollin' Phantom, he Maybach and we both iced uuupppp

[Hook]

[Lil' Flip talking]
I know you hear that right
That's a white cup
A money white cup
When we say we got a money cup
That mean we poured up a strong... soda
You dig what I'm sayin'?</pre>
