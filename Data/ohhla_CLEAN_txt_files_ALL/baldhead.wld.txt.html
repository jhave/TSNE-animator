Haha, y'all thought this was Dragnet didnt you
Wrong answer again
This song is for all the mutherfuckin chicken head bitches
And we kept the mutherfuckin names the same
Cause we think being a bald head bitch is a god damn shame

[Verse 1]
What the fuck is goin on in this god damn world
What are you bitch a boy or a girl?
I can't tell cause your shit on the sides is gone
You remind me of that monkey lookin bitch Grace Jones
Fucked up is how you look to Willie D
I just gotta have a bitch that has more hair than me
Some try to cover up by weavin it through
You ain't foolin nobody
We know your bald headed too

Chorus:
Bald Head Hoes
Whatcha see D, w-w-w-whatcha see D
I see some bald headed hoes
Bald Head Hoes
Whatcha see D, w-w-w-whatcha see D
I see some bald headed hoes

[Verse 2]
There should be a crime against bald head hoes
Why they want to be bald
Nobody knows
Being bald makes a gal look like a beast
Stupid ass hoes ain't ya heard of grease
Hell naw
Cause if you did you'd have some up there
Like your pussy you gotta give it proper care
Every time I look around I see a damn disgrace
Motherfucking wig pieces all over the place
Its from them Bald head hoes
They just so damn mean
The meanest ass hoes I ever seen
Ain't got no hair so they act crude
And wanna go and pick a fight with the girls who do
Am I right? (you right)
Hell yeah Im right
Ive seen this shit night after night
Instead of wearin other peoples hair you dumbass bitch
You need to buy some dog mane and grow you own damn shit

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Now I just can't go with a bald head hoe
You ain't gotta ask why for me to tell you so
If I cant run through her hair with my hand
Somehow it seems like I be fucking a man
So stay away you bold hickies
I know you out there
Talkin to you hoes who ain't got no hair
Your sister bald Zanny
Your mamma bald Eddie
I bet you even got a bald headed ass granny

Chorus

(talking)
Now this is how you spot a bald headed hoe

[Verse 4]
Hair spots on a hot sunny day
Too many gaps in the scalp is a dead giveaway
I saw no hair Clair
Yesterday on the cut
Today I saw the girl her hair was down to her butt
I hope that she now, that I know it aint real
But I wont squeal not even on Andrea
Kim, Shawn or Merylinn
Nor Tamika and Rika the famous bald head twins
Something must be done
About these citizens
You ask
what will I do to support my fellow man?
Im proposing a bill
To capital hill
To kill all bald headed women at will
