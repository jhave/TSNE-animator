[Chamillionaire - Talking]
Paul Willigan, you already know

Look..
You might think you got her, on lock like a locker
I already got her, comin' out of her boxers
If she's hot and got curves
don't let me spot her, cuz you will spot her hoppin' into my dropper
Whenever the phone rings ya girl never be home
*BEEP* nigga leave a message after the tone
"Baby, I know ya home, you were right I was wrong
Let it be known, Chamillion is incredibly thrown
You know when he show and open up his trunk when he glowin'
Never go over a penny of gasoline when he po' it
I'ma fan, Koopa's insane he's almost perfect
Never polite grab a wood-wheel, he always hurt it"
Sue me, for all my bills or my 20 inch wheels
If you feel that you can still say the lizard ain't real
after I steal you in ya grill and force you to deal
With the pain all you can say is that nigga to real
Koopa..my accountant calls me Mr. Discount
Cuz I throw him his money back and say take dis count
Me and my nigga Tigga is some thuggin' guerillas
Dub-Wheelers, footlocker never nothin' in Dillards</pre>
