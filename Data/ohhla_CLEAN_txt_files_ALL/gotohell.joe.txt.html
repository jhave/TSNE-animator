[Intro - Joe Budden - talking]
Joey!
Tahaha
That N.J. bullshit, I'm on it
I'm on the same shit I've been on really
Niggaz probably just ain't know I was on it
Amalgam, look here
I mean (oh!)

[Verse 1 - Joe Budden]
Still regular, just stuck in a rapper's body
Made some bread off this shit but still rap's a hobby
I never got an invite, I had to crash the party
Now it's just models inside, I'm at the after party
I set trends, here's somethin for the fags to copy
Succeedin, everybody from the past get's salty (but I)
I get in the booth and own that bitch
Won't stop 'til all my brothers are Jonas rich
Or wealthy, not rich, fuck it, see I aspire to be Mr. Buffett
Warren, not from just tourin
I used to grind, hustle hard for some hot Jordan's ('til)
'Til my mind went beyond and all that got borin
The streets watchin but it's outlook is not important (nah)
I'm tryin to pocket a fortune without the stocks soarin
If you ain't into gettin paper, let it be (just know we)
Just know we too parallel to every meet, think about it now (oh!)

[Chorus - Sample from "Go to Hell" by Alice Cooper] - 4X
You can go to hell

[Joe Budden - talking over Chorus]
Ya mean?
I never really cared for what, mother, other motherfuckers had to say about a nigga
I ain't never really gave a fuck
I got a place all you niggaz can go
A first class tickets for all you niggaz
Not even coach (goin), cocksuckers

[Verse 2 - Joe Budden]
They say he can't come to the hood, he got ran out
How's he livin so good? His money should've ran out (nah)
Figured he'd be thirsty for a hand out
Or livin at his man's house, none of that ever panned out
Call him fake ass
Say "he as fake as, his girl's fake ass"
Say "we don't hear him on the radio and he ain't been out in so long
Dude can't even rap", you couldn't be so wrong (Joey!)
Got a different type of censorship
So whatever I'm blessed with, I don't mention it (I don't even mention it)
That shit is soft (plus)
And my motto is when you get inside the end zone, act like you've been there before
Says somethin about your character to always brag
So if you never had, act like you always have, for real
Here's somethin to adhere to, be careful
'Cause with so much dick in your mouth, it's hard to hear you, pause

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden - talking over Chorus]
Look what you niggaz made me do
Had to pause somethin
Ya mean?
I don't even be on no pause bullshit neither
I'm a grown ass man, I ain't even got time for it but
Every now and then you gotta make an exception!

[Verse 3 - Joe Budden]
Look, they say don't argue with fools, me I do it for debate sake
I'm the nigga that embrace hate
Take a minute, think about how much ya cake weigh? (and then)
Then know I'm on your mind havin a great stay (and then)
Actually, I hope to never have to vacate
You see I'm much more vaca than AK
How you premeditate hate? (nigga at least)
At least have the balls to nay say when a nigga face to face (let's)
Let's see if you still wanna disrespect the King, savior (I doubt that)
I'll introduce you, in case you never seen a razor
All that mean behavior
Have whatspoppin.net at ya wake and use the pic for my screensaver (nigga)
See I ain't losin no sleep
You a small piece of bark and I'm on to the whole tree
And please, know there's never been a nigga more "I don't give a fuck" than Joe is
Even before show biz (oh!)

[Chorus]

[Outro - Joe Budden talking over Chorus]
'Cause what I always try to explain to a nigga
Niggaz like a small thing to a giant
It's like minute, it's like
I'm lookin at so much other shit like
Fuckin mental midget niggaz man
