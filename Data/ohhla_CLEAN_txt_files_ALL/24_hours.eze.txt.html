24 hours to live...
24 hours to live...

Seven-thousand, four hundred, twenty three grains
of sand drop from the hourglass
It's how much time I got left on this planet
Some motherfucker's gotta die!
I'm an evil motherfucker ready to tear shit up
I'm gonna put these things on you, and never let up
See, my momma...she was wrong when I was born
That a nigga like E should'a never been born
Too late, big mistake in '72
It's '92, now the year of code blue
15 hours..11 minutes..30 seconds
I'm a motherfuckin' wreck
Gonna pay back niggas who did me wrong in the past
My days ain't long
I'm comin' strong and fast
Lock up 8 niggs..kill up 10 pigs
??? and fuckas are ?altered? by a 2
Now what else can I do?
Fuck, fuck, fuck and plant my seeds
Leavin' kids in this world like me
The lunatic psycho mutherfucka Eazy-E

Chorus (sang)
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die

Sky diving, scuba diving
To Evil Kinevil stunt car drivin'
Bungee cord jumpin' off a bridge
It's hard to breathe with a fractured rib
I can't take this shit
Let me see how much more time I got to spend
Hit more skins
Back up in her pussy
Up in the back
I gotta let off
A few more nuts
I'm starting to panic
I'm starting to sweat
'Cause I don't really wanna die yet
Dizzy spells, flashbacks in my head
Niggas ain't want me to bein' happy when I'm dead
But I ain't goin' out unless 30 niggas die
I'm dying anyway so I'm thinking suicide
Run into a crowd of niggas dyin' by the pistol
Took the motheruckin' whistle

Chorus

To sweep with the feet when he hit the concrete
Chop him up, dice him up and sacrifice his meat
Drag him by his ankles to the cemetary
(Screams)
Shut the fuck up nigga
'Cause you ain't seen shit
I'm 'bout to take this ???? and staight up grip
I'm holdin' the neck of the devil and drink his blood
Allowing my soul to be polluted by his evil root
And now I'm mad insane, red as ???? as I strain for my hearbeat
To thumpety-thump to pump, it might burst
False alarms, and no harm that will commit to the E
But now I'm down to an hour 23
Time is moving fast, but not that slow
I thought I had an hour, but it's seconds left the go
I ran into the office
No more time is left
I ran up to the doctor with a bomb to my (BOOM)

Chorus


Spoken:
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
As time winds down to it's last 24 hours
in an earth that weighs 60 trillion tons
Travelling 1,037 1/3 mph, how do you define time?
What is a minute?
How important is an hour when 24 hours becomes a lifetime

Oooooh, so define how do we define time?
Now you choose
How will you spend your last 24 hours?
C'mon..talk to me

3X Chorus ("must die" is faded into next chorus loop)
