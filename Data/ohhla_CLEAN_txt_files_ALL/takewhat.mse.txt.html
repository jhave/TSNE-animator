[Mase] 
Yo, I be that young fly fellow, got thorough 
Down for denaro, hit everything in the Triburo 
And I'm the newest member of the Bad Boy team 
And I'mma bring this nigga Puff mad more C.R.E.A.M. 
With hooks galore, leave this city shook for short 
And I'mma take 'em back where Biggie took 'em before 
You stay a playa' 
Since you can't stay up with the Pope
And stick to what you do best, stick to wearin' coke 
You lookin' for excuses, ways to say you're broke 
Can't keep a whip, cuz you can't pay the note 
Fuck the side, I'm waiting for you on top, Mercedes drop 
Black 380's cops, 'till the day I get knocked 
All I ask when I die, dress me fly and neatly 
And brush my waves so I'm handsome when the bitches greet me 
Word from the wise, niggas jerk pies, we hurt them guys 
Bust lead, to skin they head and leave them circumcised 
So how you wanna settle this? 
Rappin' or on some ghetto shit 
We can do it yo way, with mics or with metal shit 

1 - 	[DMX] 
	Niggas wanna shout, I'mma make noise 
	Niggas run they mouth, I'mma break jaws 
	Mase is comin' out, we gon' take yours 
	Harlem World uptown baby, we make wars 
	Niggas wanna shout, I'mma make noise 
	Niggas run they mouth, I'mma break jaws 
	Mase is comin' out, we gon' take yours 
	Harlem World uptown baby, we make wars 

[Mase] 
Yo, yo before it's all over, lot of blood gon' be spilled 
We ain't discriminatin' even thugs gon' be killed 
We early inheritors , born into C.R.E.A.M 
If a nigga' get sheist then we form as a team 
Bullshit if you want and it be on for this C.R.E.A.M. 
The weatherman don't even know the storm I'mma bring 
But yo, I'm not the man with whom you interact 
So before you grab gatts to jack, remember that 
You take dough from Mase, you might as well send it back 
I got thugs everywhere, where you going spending that 
When clicks come to brawl, everything I hit fall 
Niggas play sick wid y'all, wit me they ain't sick at all 
No matter how big or small, I get rid of ya'll 
And shit I spit at y'all, come in one size fit all 

Repeat 1

[Mase] 
Yo, yo if you think I'm on some sweet shit 
Then won't you creep quick, I let the heat spit 
Make a nigga "G" flick, classic criminal 
Keep a gatt by my genitals, thugs love me 
So don't get splashed for the minimal 
We never vest up, be in a double breast tux 
Plus keep a fresh cut, picture me getting lefts stuff
I let one lose, to show you I ain't the one do 
And I ain't puffin' nuthin', make all my gun shoot 
You let your gun loose, none o' 'em niggas gun proof 
Watch them niggas drop, when I pop one in they sunroof 
And we be lead bustin', leavin' niggas head gushin' 
You niggas talkin' 'bout guns like you said something
I'll be lacin' 'em, hollow tips, I be wastin' 'em 
That's what you faggots get, tryin' to fuck with Mase and 'em 
Bad Boy, '97, front, there'll be none o' that 
And all you cats, running your trap, one in your cap 

Repeat 1 until fade
