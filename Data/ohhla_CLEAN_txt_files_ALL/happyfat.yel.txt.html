[Intro]
Yeah
I just thought it was appropriate to uhm
Just to give a shoutout
Or show my appreciation to the fathers
You know I hear a lot of rappers say
Or, brag about not having kids
Well guess what? I do
So I'd like to send this record out
To all the daddys
You know, the real daddys
Taking care of shit

[Verse 1]
This one's for the skateboarders, emcees
B-boys like me
Street artists in magazines, DJ's with babies
Working hard, you never sleep
Never get to spend that time at home
Send that money, but you never see em
Always workin, daddy's gone
To the brick laying, dirt digging
Burger flippin in the fucking kitchen
Just to get that cheque on Friday
So you could bring back home what was missing
Everyday is feed my kids day
End of the month is rent day
And if you don't get back to work on time
They tax you for that lunch break
For the D-boys holding weight
And for the daddys who are locked away
Doing time cause you was doing grind
But you was only trying to put down a plate
Maybe to get some baby J's
In the 80s, hey, that's how we raised
And then we'd feed our friend's child
When that friend has passed away

[Bridge]
Yeah, I gotta say
Yeah, to all my closest friends
You know, all the father figures in my life
You know, I really, I just wanna say thank you, you know?
For real

[Chorus]
Happy Father's Day
No matter how you're getting paid
We hustle hard
We show the way
Happy Father's Day

[Verse 2]
Tell my mama not to worry about me
Cause I ain't ever had a second to forget my daddy
I can't help but to believe in myself
It's not really a choice but a matter of being a real daddy
When I came to the world, I knew I had a talent
But I never did imagine I would be a young daddy
And I grew up like a wheel in a night night
Through a crack in the concrete, look at me - young daddy
Tell me how to walk away from a child
And I'll tell you how to walk away from a million - dumb daddy
If you can walk away from a million bucks
Then you never gave a fuck, you a dumb-luck daddy
To wake up and see a man above you
To tell you that you ain't invisible, that's a motherfucking daddy
So I need to push you and teach you how to fight
If you need to fight, fuck a right, that's a good daddy
Gotta take a second now, show love
To the trailer park, apartment, hood daddies
A man who ain't got a lot
But in a minute he would drop it all, do anything he could daddy
Jesus, when I go to sleep I feel every baby mama who never had a real daddy
Go take it out on the baby, or maybe even the man when he's only trying to become a real daddy

[Bridge]
Yeah, cause it ain't easy man
But it's a blessing man
It makes you work hard
For all the hard workers out there
I just wanna say

[Chorus]
Happy Father's Day
No matter how you're getting paid
We hustle hard
We show the way
Happy Father's Day

[Outro]
Yeah, that's from the heart
The heart of dixie
The heart of dixie</pre>
