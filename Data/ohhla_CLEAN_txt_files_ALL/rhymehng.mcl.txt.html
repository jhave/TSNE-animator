[MC Lyte]
You've heard the hard side, the rough tough side
Now it's time to hop aboard for a pleasure ride
And yo, I suggest you don't resist
This voyage, you don't wanna miss this
It makes you woozy and feel kinda dizzy
Fantasies wild and imagination BUSY

Why would you want it? {*2X*}

Go ahead spin the rude moves around
If it's faint you feel, then you oughta sit down
and let the beat just seep through the cracks
and crannies of your brain - you can't remember your name
The beat'll tip-tap and takin over your mind
A cure for this hangover, I doubt you can find
So seek if you wanna, cuz imagine your position
If they say there's a potion well then they're probably competition
Lyte has no fear because it overcomes evil
My plan stands strong, not a one is feeble
With no hesitation here's the incantation

Why would you want it? {*2X*}

Open up your ears and rev up your gears
This is MC Lyte's train, not ol' steps and stairs
And like I said, I knew you couldn't hack it
So I'll pull out the stretcher and the white straightjacket
You can talk to the fly, for more than a night
but when they ask who put you here, you tell 'em
MC Lyte - crumbs!

Why would you want it?
Why would you need it?
Why would you want it?</pre>
