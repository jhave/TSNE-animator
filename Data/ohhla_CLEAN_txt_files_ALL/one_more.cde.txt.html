[Off Topic]
Here we go, one more time
New life, new beats
New book of rhymes
Still no sleep
Head bangers butt heads and lock dreads
Over sticker-fame backpack raps that I said
In an old life
Said I wouldn't live the night
But I was never the forfeiting type, right?
Never quit, never die, never say goodbye
Without a master plan to keep the hand of my wife tight
In a skater's grip
Split a hater's lip so he can kiss my mic, twice
Been there, done that, heard that song
I wrote that track, I lived that long
Got a box full of empty pens that I been emptying
Since M.K. tagged up the gym
Patience pays in a million ways
Breaking ten years down day-by-day

[Phase Fate]
Once again, it's on
The dawn breaks on desert sand
Hold On
As the sun stares at me
Blinded burned iris sets my mind free
Now time's behind me

[Off Topic]
I found strength in the strangest places
Where the champions hang from their Timbo laces
And they chant to the bang of the army bases
'Cause I code my slang and they can't break it
Not bullet-proof but I could dodge a raindrop
J. Moore, Code Poet #1, Off Top
I'm the hand of God
Watch the cradle rock
Til the angels fall like rain on the rooftops
I been depressed on my best day
And bang my chest when death looks my way
But I'll be that rock for my bebe
We're airtight, couldn't be split by sunlight
Fresh out the box like a pair of Nikes
And clean up nicely when life gets on me
Teflon psyche
This is your brain on rap
Now who you heard better than that?

[Phase Fate]
Once again, it's on
The dawn breaks as craters in the shadow fall face
More memories replaced by past mistakes
But fuck gold, ghosts, and haste
Do not a life make
Once again, it's on
The dawn breaks on desert sand
Hold on
As the sun stares at me
Blinded burned iris sets my mind free
Now time's behind me</pre>
