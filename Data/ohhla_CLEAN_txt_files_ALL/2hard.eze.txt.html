[Eazy-E]
Yo Dre where's the goddamn drum machine?

[Dre]
Aw shit I left the muthafucka with Poog

[Eazy-E]
You dumb muthafucka 
what the fuck we gonna do now?

[Yella]
Hey, man I got some drums in the back

[Dre]
Man what the fuck is he talkin' bout

[M.C. Ren]
Yo does it look like we can play some fuckin' drums?

[Yella]
Man I can play the drums

[Everyone except Yella]
Bullshit!

[Yella]
Man I used to fuck it up at Compton

[*Arguin'*]

[M.C. Ren]
Give this nigga some sticks....
Yo Fuck it up Yella

[M.C. Ren]
Yo were two hard muthafuckaz
takin' out any punk ass suckaz
can you believe this or so be frightened
were strong as fuck, with the power of a titan
settin' a mark of destruction get it
so don't front, and say you ain't with it
you wanna rumble with us you can't hang
cause were something like a two man gang
start some shit is what we do best
scared by the suckaz say fuck the rest
so yo Eazy bust it and shoot to kill
and tell these stupid muthafuckaz the deal

[Eazy-E]
I look you dead in the eye and I spit
tell you to your face punk you ain't shit
I don't give a goddamn about feelin's
I'm just as a happy as long as I'm killin'
a 187 is in progress nigga
just as soon as I pull this trigger
automatic heavily I start firin'
and the kids on the block 
I'm the one there admirin'
a bad mouth nigga on the violent tip
I catch you talkin' some shit
and I'mma bust your lip
now who you gonna tell that I'm makin' ya soft
the police ain't shit cause I pay 'em off
I move slow always ready to go so fuck it
and bitches on my dick they know they can suck it
I'm a hard head, always havin' a fit
when I'm not allowed to tear up shit

[Eazy-E &amp; M.C. Ren]
I'm a hard muthafucka

[Chorus]
2 Hard Muthafuckaz! (x4)

[M.C. Ren]
Now look at me I'm a crazed bitch
with a case to a profanity pitch
Ren is a nigga that don't give a fuck
to pussy ass fool tryin' to press his luck
I'm ready to scrap that's if your ready to go
I take you out goin' toe to toe
E saw the conversion and hit you from the back
while you gettin' fucked by a ruthless jack
critical condition is what you recieved
thinkin' up some back up to go on retrieve
but Eazy tell what would happen my man
Eazy-E: "they would get fucked up by a ruthless clan"
so it's simple we don't give a fuck right
so you and ya boys can get the fuck out my site
I'm on tilt with class gettin' ready to blast
cause I'm a hard muthafucka

[Chorus]
2 Hard Muthafuckaz! (x4)

[Eazy-E]
Eazy and Ren is fuckin' it up again
schemin' up a plot before we begin
cause niggaz like to stare like a bitch sometimes
they say how can them niggaz have some a hell of a rhyme

[M.C. Ren]
It's simple tell 'em what we mean
when the two baddest muthafuckaz step on the scene

[Eazy-E]
Now this is some shit

[M.C. Ren]
Yo what are you sayin'

[Eazy-E]
you stupid muthafuckaz they think I'm playin'
talkin' all kinda shit of shit but I'm crackin' it up
I can afford to laugh cause I'm backin' it up
I'm not a busta I'm more like a hitman
so if you don't wanna throw then you can get down
you don't like the fuck away from me
so you can stop the shit, tryin' to fuck the E

[M.C. Ren]
You heard what he said 
it's the truth so whats up
so if you want me to go then I'mma bout to nut up
the 2 baddest muthafuckaz alive
so I don't think you and your boys can survive
you gotta girl, well if she's good to go
I bet me and E already fucked the hoe
a train was in effect and your bitch was rott
by a hell of a nigga that was hard to stop

[Eazy-E]
Yo Ren lets jet lets get the fuck on out

[M.C. Ren]
because everybody knows what where talkin' about

[Eazy-E &amp; M.C. Ren]
Where two hard muthafuckaz!

[Chorus]
2 Hard Muthafuckaz! (x4)</pre>
