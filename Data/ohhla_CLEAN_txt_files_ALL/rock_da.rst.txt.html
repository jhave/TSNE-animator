[Chorus]
Rusta came to rock the party

Smoke up the weeeed, drink down the hennnn
Once your done with that do it all again
Rusta came to rock the party
so slam down shots of that bacardi
Smoke up the weeeed, drink down the hennnn
Once your done with that do it all again

[Verse 1]
Here we go I'm gonna get it poppin
I see all the broads pop, lock, and droppin
And they ain't stopping, til there pussy poppin
And I'm not stopping, til I get them bobbing
Maaannnnnnn I just want some hear
I could careless how you act in bed
Don't get me wrong I'd love to have sex
But I'd rather blow a load all over your face and neck
Dripping to your breast to relieve all my stress
You'll get curressed after you get undressed
Yeeeeeeahhhhhhh you know what I mean
Naaaaaawwwwwwww I'm not trying to be mean
Only thing I want is just to blow my load so
Take a hit of this dro, then suck on my pole
Whoaaaaaaa now thats what I call deep throatttttt
Soo swowwwww when she goes down lowwwwwwww

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Holla mommacita chu can call me poppy
I'm crem' de la crem' you can call me cocky
Me gustara mis chicas to be naughty naughty
And I like my girls to party parrtyy
Shorty, come on grind on me
I got two freaks to grind on me
And yeah they look good, but they fine on me
So here we go, lets do a line on me
Coke, Pills, or weed, whats the drug that you need?
If your stressing cause an ex dont mess with me
But if your tripping on some x, sit next to me
I got all the things that you think that you need
Theres no need to stress, let me curress your breast
And yes I confess you look HOT in that dress
So why settle for less, you deserve the best
Lets make your hair a mess, and get you wet!!
