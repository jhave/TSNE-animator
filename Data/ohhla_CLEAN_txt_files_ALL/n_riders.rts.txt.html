[Slick Rick]
Rap battle one two, one two, check it out
All alone, gold song, like Mike Corleone
Get a little ? while in the pen, still hold the throne
Blood is the same for us to spill
I give off the impression it's no thing for us to kill
Around the way with -- street corner game, Pat Sajak
Got kids to feed, you can't stop the paycheck! (Mhmm)
A lettergram said that you're ahead of him
Nowhere on the planet nigga can't rap better than
So know that I'm the flyest, bypass
by you and your tired-ass bow down to my ass
I shit on a kid wanna vic wanted KITT
What's ??  Slick Rick, this one is dead
Life's finished, this rapper ??
Me and Rahzel on the record no cat career finished
Jump in my car, better buckle up
KITT, hurry, get me 'cross town to wreck another club

Chorus: Rahzel and Slick Rick

"For all of y'all, keepin y'all in health (to what?)
 Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself"
Rahzel, what's my name?  {Ehh-ehh, ehh-Slick Rick}
What's the timeframe?  {SIX MINUTES TO DESTINATION}
Set the hydraulics {Awwahha, "Ohh my gosh!"}
and the low mileage, make sure the car's polished
Got all the girls screamin just to hear me flow
{Aha-wweeh, "Hereeeee we goooooooo..."}

[Slick Rick]
No not rich, old boy bougie
Car KITT known to get Rolls Royce pussy
In front of y'all opponent, the man be arrogant
Is there some part of "I can slaughter anyone" that all you don't get?
My records, are ??, how dare announce attack us
Jack shit suave more debonaire about your black ass
Slick pose with another gold hit
By self eliminate a motherfucker whole click
.. All assume in the cut
Motherfucker even question if I'm human or not!
Who that swingin in Seacaucus?  The gorgeous, of course it's
thoughtless, c'mon KITT, the King of New York is
And now it's gettin kind of dark, ??
Westside Highway, park by the Tunnel
Bad car horn oinks off the man's points
Walk in, niggaz havin a ball off of Rah's joint

Chorus 3X</pre>
