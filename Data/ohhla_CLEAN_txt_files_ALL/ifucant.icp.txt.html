Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Come here man check it out
You know there laughing at you man
Fuck them man you know what im sayin come down here man
And join the carnival man

Gangsters bangin nuts straight hangin
Freakazoids baseheads spareing changes
Homelss hobos pushing dead bodies in a cart
Listen to the good part
Poke around doors roamin the land
Chewing on somebodys head I dont understand
Its to much for my nugget to process
So I stop the car to get undressed
Then climb the trees and kick it with the owls
You dont like that you can suck my balls
It's just me and my homeboy large you see
No they cant nobody can see them but me
Lunatics zombies and goons roaming underneath
The 17 moons of delray hellray suicide person
It cant be the fuckin I might as well join him

Hey bitch boy were the fuck are you going
Dont you know they dont like richies were you goin
You dont belong here I think you best leave
Before I grab your chicken neck and squeeze
I tighten up the sewer caps and dive in
I pray for dead chicken boys for my little friend
To snack on his name is willaberags thanks you know your not a bad guys shaggs
It rains only twice a year around here
The streets are dry because of the sky
Its filled with smog and fog and fuck
I finally had it im gonna jump! (is he dead?)
No I bounced my shits made out of rubber
A toxic waste freak show mutha fucker
And im part of the circus show
If you cant beat 'em join 'em like I did yo

Nobody wants you got no were to go
Come down and join up with the carnival show
Your a addicted to crack and you dont have a back
Here at the freakshow we dont care about that
You might have 2 heads and you might have 10
You might have a finger growing out of your chin
Here at the carival you cant go wrong
It donsent it matter if your neck bone is 3 feet long

If you cant beat 'em join 'em
If you cant beat 'em join 'em
If you cant beat 'em join 'em
Just join them muther fucker
If you cant beat 'em join 'em
If you cant beat 'em join 'em
If you cant beat 'em join 'em
So just join them bitch boy
If you cant beat 'em join 'em
If you cant beat 'em join 'em
If you cant beat 'em join 'em
Just join them muther fucker
If you cant beat 'em join 'em
If you cant beat 'em join 'em
If you cant beat 'em join 'em
So just join them bitch boy
Just join them
Cause you cant cant beat 'em
So just join them motherfuckers
Cant beat 'em just join 'em
Cant beat 'em just join 'em bitch boy</pre>
