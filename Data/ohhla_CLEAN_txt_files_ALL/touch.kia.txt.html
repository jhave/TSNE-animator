[Intro]
This goes out to my folks in the club
Put your hands up in the air if you feel me
Grind all day, party all night
When it's time to rolllllllll

[Chorus 1: repeat 2X] + (Wifey)
We gon' touch when we leave the club
We gon' touch when we leave the club - is she ready?
(We gon' touch when we leave the club)
(We gon' touch when we leave the club)

[Chorus 2]
Is she ready? Ay ay, take one of these
Ay ay, drink some of this
Is she ready? Ay ay, pop one of these
Ay ay, smoke some of this

[Kia Shine]
Is she ready? She ready to pop
My name Kia Shine and she want me to knock
Aight, aight; already
She ready to go and the gal just missed me
Don't sweat me - just, let me breathe
Ahhh - in a second, we gon' leave
I got some tricks rolled up my sleeve
I got some {dick} you about to eat
Now momma hop in this quarter tilt (tilt)
Don't pop you another pill (chill)
And make sure you drink yo' water (water)
I'm 'bout to hurt somebody's daughter (daughter)
She said she feelin my swagger (my swagger)
I said I'm feelin that ass (that ass)
She respect my fresh
And in a minute she gon' respect my sex
I told her!

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Kia Shine]
Kinfolk! Now this groupie chick was so deceptive
Actin like she ain't never heard my records
Knowin damn well that her whole objective
Was to find Kia Shine and try to sex him
Club closed now she ready to go to breakfast
After that she wanna get a suite at the Westin
Hopped in the whip so she could follow
She said she love girls and she love to swallow
Promiscuous girl like Nelly Furtado
Like a Shirley Murdoch, I'll be gone tomorrow
One night stand like a, comedi-an
You not my girl and me not your man
I'm sayin, ain't no sense in tryin to pretend
Check out time, Kia Shine is in the wind
All good things must come to an end
But if I catch yo' ass again babygirl bring a friend
AIGHT~!

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Jack Frost]
I'm somethin else with myself, the one night bandit
I burn a broad head up - and then leave her stranded
See her next week again - this instant replay
But this time she got a friend - well we gon' do a 3-way
I'm from Memphis mayne so the game come easy
I pop 'em, in LAX, lotus or the prefix
Well if you know Jack Frost, well then you know I love snows
Especially the ones that wanna hit me with the dough
I'm on Ro-se-mo', two rolls in haze
Lookin for strange love, like Brigette and Flav'
If you wanna get saved - girl go to church
But if you wanna get laid - then it's time to twerk
So drink one of these, and smoke one of these
You ain't scared is ya~? Well pop one of these
Drink one of these, smoke one of these
A blonde and a brunette, I'ma knock both of these
I told ya!

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Outro]
This goes out to my folks in the club
Put your hands up in the air if you feel me
Grind all day, party all night
Then it's time to rolllllllll</pre>
