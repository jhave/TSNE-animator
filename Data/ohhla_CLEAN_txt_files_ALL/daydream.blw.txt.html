Looking back through time in the corners of my mind
I see you standing here
Oh baby how I miss you
And how much I need to kiss you
Run my fingers through your hair
But then again,it's just my imagination
Being close to you was such a sweet sensation
But then we had to have that terrible confrontation

Daydreamin' takes me where I want to be
Daydreamin' lets me have you here with me

Oh,girl if you knew all that I've been going through
You'd have a change of heart
But come rain or shine you're foverer on my mind
Of my life you're the part
But then again,it's just my imagination
Being close to you was such a sweet sensation
But then we had to have that terrible confrontation

Daydreamin' takes me where I want to be
Daydreamin' lets me have you here with me

Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
You stole my heart and I belong to you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
You are the one and I will be true

D...D...D...D...Daydreamin' (x4)

You know I want you girl
You know I miss you girl
Come back,come back baby..oo-wee,be my lady
You know I miss you girl
You were my only world
Come back,come back honey
Make my day bright and sunny...yeah

Come back ...honey....</pre>
