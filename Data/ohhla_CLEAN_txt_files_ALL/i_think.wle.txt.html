Song:   I Think They Crazy
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

If I ever disappoint ya'll
Then appoint me to the lord right now
Cause right now
I'm ever so closer to exposing a culture, an unmarked source
An untapped market
My target consumer's consumed in the music of Wale's movement
Love day coming soon, as soon as it drop
I'm a bring back June
That's fire, and I ain't even lying
My revolution is not televised
The betterment of music
I do it for the lovers
The ones opposed: muh'fuck 'em
They can't touch us
Can't fuck with the flow
Selling better rap to an elephant
Hold up, a rat to an elephant
An elephant's fierce
So I elevate here with the presence of a rat
So every time I rap, big niggaz get scared
Hey, rewind that back
Yeah, I think I might lose em
Apparently they all Terrence Newman
You can't cover me
You like a newspaper blanket
Used by the bums at the station
Insufficient to the winds, a nigger get it in
The city on my back I will carry till we win
A 2 year plan to resurrect rap
A Grammy for my man while I elevate the cap
I meditate fast and pray that one day
We'll hold it down now too siempre
When they say they hate me
They say cause they ain't me
But niggaz can't faze me
No, cause the radio play me
On heavy rotation
And those niggaz hatin

[Chorus: Gnarls Barkley]
What's the problem is you dumb or stupid
Nah, ya'll just crazy

They say I'm too shallow
And my material is so materialistic
That when I give them that conscious
They subconsciously don't acknowledge my comments
So I've opted to subliminally slip content that's somewhat conscious
Every so often, so it's really subconscious
Under the surface it work like gospel
And top if it, my topics is
More relevant here to the common man
There's a lot more common man than there's hustlers
Notice how my commons ad I got bucks up [? ]
I got bucks on
I love shoes and my MTs get it, if you don't get it fuck you
I love food in a metaphorical sense
When it's money on the plate, I shake, I'm gluttonous
They loving my composure
My composition book's golden
I leave my competition hopin'
Soaking in defeat like pedicure
Get it? Nevermind, you wasn't ready for it
Machete sword flow
I get into when the pen do what the pen do, bitch move
Skip school, nigga I ain't got class
That's why I grab ass every time I watch it pass
I meditate fast and pray that one day
We'll hold it down now too siempre
When they say they hate me
They say cause they ain't me
But niggaz can't faze me
No, cause the radio play me
On heavy rotation
And those niggaz hatin

[Chorus: Gnarls Barkley]</pre>
