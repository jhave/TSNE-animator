[Chorus 2X: samples from "Knife Edge" by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]
"Just a step, cried the sad man"
"Take a look down at the madman"
"Only fear breaks the silence"
"Take a look down at the madman"

[Sean Price]
Take a good look, at a mad man
I got mad plans, I got mad stans
I used to rap, but I deaded the plan
With up town, cop hard, twenty seven, the gram
Yo, I ain't with that, this and the third
I'm only with fat dick in ya bird, you know me bitch
Slap shit out ya word, must look like a joke to ya
Pull out the knife and watch it poke through ya
Lightin' the dope, fuck pops, fighting my folks
Walk the street strapped, extra clip inside of my coat
I'm a motherfuckin' mad man, off the chain
Cranium crap, when gun clap, off with ya brain, bitch

[Chorus]

[Sean Price]
I'm all tight with it, you all right with it
You type nice but not, Sean Price with it
You got a ring in the rolly, but that ain't ice tinted
You coppin' pies, don't get mad when I slice in it
Cee'lo trip six bitch, throw some dice on it
Four chicken wings, throw some fried rice on it
Get a car, and I throw some two o's on it
Dick is hard, so I throw a few hoes on it
Yo, it's nothing you can tell me or say
You funny nigga, Bill Bellamy, gay, uh
Yo, I'm a mad man, off of the chain
Cranium crap, when gun clap, off with ya brain, bitch

[Chorus]

[Sean Price]
Aiyo, I need dollar, so I'm beefin' niggaz up
In the game, with a tat, like Rasheed Wallace
Lovin' rap since Afrika Bam'
But that ain't stoppin' me from clappin' ya fam
Wrapping crack in Saran, stackin' macs up in the van
I'm packing, what the fuck is the plan, yo
I'm a two face snake in the grass, call me a klepto
Who dick get hard from watch Money Love on Metro
I rock, Mecca, Polo, Iceberg, Fubu, but Ecko I rock
Better solo, fight, hurt, shoot you and jet yo
Get it, I said, I rock Mecca, Polo, Iceberg, Fubu, but Ecko I rock
Better solo, fight, hurt, shoot you and jet yo

[Chorus]</pre>
