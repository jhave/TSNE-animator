[Ryan Leslie] (Slim)
YEAH! (Hey! Hey! Hey!) Let it rock! Uh! (Baby!) Just feel it for a second 
Come on! (Now your rockin this!) Yeah! (Hey!) Yeah! 
Uh! Come on a come on a come on!

[Verse One: Slim] (Ryan Leslie)
Tell me why your here tonight
Are you lookin for someone to do you right
Yeah,I see you standin by yourself
And I had to step before somebody (Came up to you)
So I approached you on the wall
I Started off by sayin beautiful (And then I saw)
That you already had a man
Cause I noticed the ring on your hand
So I thought to myself slow it down, cause I don't want it to get the best of me
But I'm startin to get closer now, cause I'm feelin that this might be destiny
And Im dancin with you though its wrong, and I can't help but notice your feelin it
And there's really no use holdin out, cause I know it's that good love you need
I can give it to you baby

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie] (Slim)
If  it's, good, love. you need, I, give, good, lovin (Oh yeah, good lovin baby)
How, it's supposed, to be (Awww baby)  All, night and it won't slow down
(Let me give it to you)
If  it's, good, love,  you need (Good love) I, give, good, lovin
(OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!)
How, it's supposed, to be, all, night and it won't slow down

[Verse Two: Slim] (Ryan Leslie)
Imagine if you came with me
and imagine all the things that we can do
Me and you,  can make it work so easily
baby I can see it in the way you move (The way you move)
I get it from the way you dip
from the way your bitin on your bottom lip (I know you want it)
Cause even though you got a man
you're still takin me by the hand
So I thought to myself slow it down
cause I don't want it to get the best of me
But I'm startin to get closer now
cause I'm feelin that this might be destiny (Get closer noooooooowww!!!!)
And Im dancin with you though it's wrong
and I can't help but notice your feelin it (Though it's wrong)
And there's really no use holdin out
cause I know it's that good love you need
I can give it to you oh oh

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie] (Slim)
If  it's, good, love. you need, I, give, good, lovin
(Oh good lovin baby)
How, it's supposed, to be (Awww yeah you love, the way, I'm a love you baby!))  
All, night and it won't slow down
If  it's, good, love,  you need (Let me give it to you oooh oh!)
I, give, good, lovin
How, it's supposed, to be, all, night and it won't slow down
(Good lovin baby!!!!)

[Verse Three: Fabolous]
Yo! I got that good love
You ain't heard of me by now well you should of?!
What you been under a rock or your just outta touch
I know you work, go to school, and don't get out as much
So if you let me baby, I'm a let you what's good
A TV with HD wouldn't show as good 
I got that foggin up the windows in the back of Jeeps
Yeah I wake that thing up, and put it back to sleep
You put it back to sleep? That's what I said right?
They do it wrong baby come get your head right
And I think everybody know what Biggie said right?
If it's right is on tonight like headlights
And I don't slow down, not even for red lights
You cant stop this G double O.D.
We can both try to fight it like codeine
But you need this Loso, in case you ain't know so
Slim take us outta here

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie] (Slim)
If  it's, good, love, you need, I, give, good, lovin (Girl your beautiful)
How, it's supposed, to be (Saw you standin by the wall)
All, night and it won't slow down (Take you by the hand)
If  it's, good, love, you need (Good love is all I need)
I, give, good, lovin (Baby come with me)
How, it's supposed, to be, all, night and it won't slow down
(Good lovin baby!!!!)

[Bridge: Slim] (Ryan Leslie)
Slow down, slow down, and it wont slow down
Slow down, slow down (And it wont slow down)
Slow down, slow down, and it wont slow down
Slow down, slow down (And it won't slow down)

[Outro: Ryan Leslie)
If it's good, love, you need, I, give, good, lovin
How, it's, supposed, to be, all, night, and it wont slow down
If it's good, love, you need, I, give, good, lovin
How, it's, supposed, to be, all, night, and it wont slow down</pre>
