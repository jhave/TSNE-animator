[Verse 1]
We smoke everyday
On an average 9,10,11,12 even 13 blunts
But when we on our last
And we aint got no mo grass
Its time to re up 
Got to hurry up
Go and re up

[Chorus 1](2x)
So we just looking for the weedman
The weedman the weedman
And we just wanna smoke (smoke)
We just wanna smoke (smoke)
We just wanna smoke (smoke)

[Verse 2]
Hey I'm getting closer 
To the weedman
I think he's somewhere close
Smell it on his clothes
Look! There he goes
Now you don't got to smoke with me (with me)
But if you wanna smoke my tree (my tree)
Just reach into that right (right)
Pocket on yo thigh (thigh)
And show a nigga five

[Chorus 2](2x)
We don found the fucking weedman
The weedman the weedman
And we about to smoke (smoke)
We about to smoke (smoke) 
We about to smoke (smoke)

Yea this yo boy Lil Jon

Aye man hold on  this yo boy Lil Bo man (smoker)
And I hear music man
Aye  we gon take dis shit to 12 play

Three I got a fluffy bag of this weed

Twelve damn this weed good as hell yea</pre>
