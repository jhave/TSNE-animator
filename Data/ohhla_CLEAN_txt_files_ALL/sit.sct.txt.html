Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Street niggas got some in a situation
Thank God I made it through my situation
My situation ain't life saving
Transaction lead me into this situation
Street niggas got some in a situation
Thank God I made it through my situation
My situation ain't life saving
Transaction lead me into this situation

[Verse 1]
Thank God I made it through my situation
I pray my cousin make it out this situation
The judge try to hide you by some pistol cases
But you're a street nigga, you need your pistol daily
Sometimes money can even be the situation
I got a son and a daughter, two different situations
Two different baby mamas, plus I got open charges
I got street problems, I'm a jugg regardless
This a situation, my situation paper
My situation fax, my situation plastic
My situation fault, my situation streets
My situation in future, a quarter mil' a week

[Chorus]
Street niggas got some in a situation
Thank God I made it through my situation
My situation ain't life saving
Transaction lead me into this situation
Street niggas got some in a situation
Thank God I made it through my situation
My situation ain't life saving
Transaction lead me into this situation

[Verse 2]
You ain't ever seen me faded, don't you say that, nigga
The wrong transaction and you go to the bad intention
Get caught with that dog food, you know who is it
My situation with them bails, I get like seven million
Dirty streets I live it, I told them bricks I live it
Hope you run to the nexty, hope you run to the sixty
My mind is so ridiculous, I got money vision
All about my business and my situations
A lot of niggas hate me, my baby mamas hate me
Got hater situations, yeah, my life's crazy
Some on free drugs I don't know what I'm thinking
That's the situation, money situation

[Chorus]
Street niggas got some in a situation
Thank God I made it through my situation
My situation ain't life saving
Transaction lead me into this situation
Street niggas got some in a situation
Thank God I made it through my situation
My situation ain't life saving
Transaction lead me into this situation

[Verse 3]
Better than make it home everyday pray for your situation
I'm a stay dope grind nigga that's my occupation
I refuse to tie it and robbing it, yeah, that's the situation
I never talk in a room of interrogation
That snitching any bitching, but that's your situation
I'm certified in paper chasing, I'm down that paper taking
That situation for street nigga, they tell me scoot
You niggas ain't no big dog, they're just some oversized plush

[Chorus]
Street niggas got some in a situation
Thank God I made it through my situation
My situation ain't life saving
Transaction lead me into this situation
Street niggas got some in a situation
Thank God I made it through my situation
My situation ain't life saving
Transaction lead me into this situation</pre>
