Holiday, Holiday, slow that shit DOWN~!
C'mon now, they done.. they know I do it
They know when I do it it get done
Two sticks in my bun, but, but first of all
when I say two sticks in my bun, I mean
that when I put a bun in my hair
Like when I put my hair in a ponytail
and I wrap my hair in a bun
I put two Chinese sticks in my bun with the Chinese bang
Cause y'all y'all minds is in the gutter
That's what two sticks in my bun mean, okay?
But Holiday you already know, y'knahmsayin?
They heard that hard spittin, they heard that fast shit
NOWWWW, y'know, you gotta slow it down for them y'know
Umm, they wanna hear me sing
Y'know behind every bad bitch there's a really sweet girly, girl
There's a really sweet, Harajuku Barbie, and umm
Now it's time for them to hear me {*inhales*}
get all nice and soft and, moist
I I mean, I'm-I'm sorry I didn't mean, I didn't mean to say that
I meant, this is the portion of the tape where
I just wanna be more, y'know, delicate and... wet
{*SPLASH*} I'm I'm, I'm so, I I, I didn't mean to say that
I meant, that y'know, Holiday just slow it down daddy!</pre>
