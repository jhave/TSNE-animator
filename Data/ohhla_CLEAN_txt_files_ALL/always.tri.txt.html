Uh, yeah
This goes out to all my girls
All around the world
You got a good man
Y'all feel me on this, uh yo, yo, yo

I'll always
Come back to you
I'll always
Come back to you
I'll always
Come back to you
I'll always
Come back to you

[Trina]
Yo I used to think I ain't need a man
Had one ain't see the man
I was so conceited then
But I'm older now
Doing my thing, what ya told me now
Brought closer to show me how
And I'm in love with a baller now
Treat him right cause that's all I got
The good dick had me falling out
And I love the freaky things he be saying
And the names he be calling out
Yeah and he knows how to treat me
Eats me when he freaks me
The real one and his cum tastes so sweet
Rough sex to a slow beat
As he holds me and pokes me
And the beat won't stop, the bass don't drop
Till I climb on top of his cock and close shop
Make his toes lock
While y'all hoes jock
See you got me callin'

I'll always
Come back to you
I'll always
Come back to you
I'll always
Come back to you
I'll always
Come back to you

[Trina]
Yeah that nigga don't bought me things
But that nigga done taught me things
How to maintain, respect the game
Save my change and even showed me some crazy things
And we exchanged our favorite things
I got inside his fantasies
Cause them things was the middle of me
Climaxin' on the canopy
Well this freak put his hand inside of me
Unsolved mystery
Thinkin' 'bout gets me all wet
And I'm pissed he ain't called yet
I guess good sex is what you call it
And I'll know he'll call back
So I'mma just go cook for the man
Shake up crooks and do the books for the man
Makin' the cheese you done took from the man
If the sex is good I'mma hook the man
Even if he's a veteran

If I go on my way without you
Oh how can I go?
If I go on my way without you
Oh where will I go?

I'll always
Come back to you
I'll always
Come back to you
I'll always
Come back to you
I'll always
Come back to you</pre>
