[Bun B]
PA is the town,w here it's goin down
Westside to the east, it's off the chain (chain)
I'm bangin my surrounds, swangin on these clowns
Candy paint is driippin, leavin stains (stains)
You see the diamonds grippin on the grain (grain)
Chrom-ed lady sittin on the grill (grill)
Leanin down the fifth, smokin on a piff
Drop the top and let 'em see the trill (trill)
UGK 4 Life, you betta ask yo' wife
She'll tell you Bun and Pimp the re-al (re-al)
Light, mag, the knife, so if you actin shife
Then I'ma give ya somethin you could fe-el (fe-el)
Don't make me have to go and pull this ste-el (ste-el)
I cock it back and den I let it go (go) 
And put one in ya dome, 'cause I be puttin' on 
fo' my city, betta let it know (know!)</pre>
