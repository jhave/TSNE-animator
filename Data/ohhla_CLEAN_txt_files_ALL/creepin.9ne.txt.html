Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[INTRO: (spoken)]
Areola, that shirt came off, that bra came off and...so crazy
What a day. What a motha fuckin' day. I tell ya
Baby, I'm home! Hey, baby!
What's that smell? Smell like..like my baby's pussy
What the fuck?! (Oh, shit! Sorry! Shit!)

[CHORUS]
What do you do when you're workin, come home, and I'm creepin' out the back door
Pants on the floor and you're lookin' at her sayin' "Whatcha doin' that for?"

[VERSE 1]
This is how it goes when you're hard at work (hard at work)
I'm with ya lady and I'm all up in her skirt (all up in her skirt)
She chose a rapper 'cause this rapper know how to tap her
Strap her down and attack her while you sneak in, watch pornos and jerk (watch pornos and jerk)
And ya can't be mad at me 'cause your thick bitch wanna ravage me
Got my big dick in her cavities then it's spit spit I'm in anatomy
And ya can't come badgin' me 'cause she sick wanna insert half of me
Straight addicted to the master he whips the sticks up without batteries
Poetry in motion
I make her water 'cause I'm a scholar I father her twat and bother her I got her
She'll eat anything I want her to eat, she'll swallow anything I want her to swaller
she'll go down &amp; chew on my dog, doin' anything that'll make me holler
And you the victim don't even know whats ya comin' home to, I'm bangin it out &amp; she's screamin like we doin kungfu
Im feelin' right cuz you the one she do the wrong to
Now that you know your lady is creepin' - whatcha goin' do??

[CHORUS]
What do you do when you're workin, come home, and I'm creepin' out the back door
Pants on the floor and you're lookin' at her sayin' "Whatcha doin' that for?"

[VERSE 2]
But it aint no need though, cuz I'm a G tho..
I find em, then fuck em, feed em &amp; I let him repo
I understand you're punchin that clock
but while you're punchin man, Im punchin that twat - gonna get that overtime
BG Bullet does step over the line, gotta key to the crib, this pussy's suppose to be da line
this bitch too old to be lying, she done told her husband things suppose to be fine
you da bigger man, and I'm her clover leaf now, what about the clothes that he found:
did you tell him you love him, did you tell him you wit it
did you tell him you this love his dick every time that you get it - I don't think so
so Ima keep things low, keep pullin these strings close that pop that El Nino - (yes!)
Cuz Im the best at it, your lady's sex addict - all in the spot when ur not, getting my head patted
But Ima keep this thing respectable homie
I'm using condoms in your festival homie, no need to killa nigga!

[CHORUS]
What do you do when you're workin, come home, and I'm creepin' out the back door
Pants on the floor and you're lookin' at her sayin' "Whatcha doin' that for?"

[VERSE 3]
What would you do if your boo crept on you-with me
new tattoo with the letter "P" - all over her humps like the letter "B"
Trip if you want to, scared nigger - never me: your girl has been land-marked
that means that I marked her - that means that I skidded sperm all over her twat fur:
that means that I got her, where you never had her- sex game critical, now she is a master
You never got ur dick licked, mine is getting tongue-kissed
she could suck a orange thru a straw - call her Sunkist:
Man, she a cold chick, yeah I know you miss that: bank account access- ya- you know I did that
Put it where her ribs at, then I let her slip on it
if ya like it then ya shoulda put a ring on it
Cuz Paul Mussan had that pussy with a sling on it
And I aint even poppin' E homie, but the question is

[CHORUS]
What do you do when you're workin, come home, and I'm creepin' out the back door
Pants on the floor and you're lookin' at her sayin' "Whatcha doin' that for?"</pre>
