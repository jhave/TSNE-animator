Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I've never been a slave to a whole lot
Except staring at the hands on the old clock
Around and around we go til one day right from the ground we grow
How could anybody ever act like they are all that
When everyone of us used to live in a ball sack
No matter which way your ball cap tilts
At one point we all thought that santa clause was real
The world has shifted me but most of all funny
So lately the dreams I have don't involve money
I just wanna pay my bills and write new songs
I'll never be a millionare, fine move on
I started flying when I detached myself
From the friends that just relaxed upset they don't have wings
I never turn my back on you I just never looked back at you
Because I don't think selfish is a bad thing
So here's a little gift set from me to you
The manifesto we are the black clover crew
This is more to us than singing in a booth
We're coming down the chimney and bringing you the truth
So here's a little gift set from me to you
The manifesto we are the black clover crew
This is more to us than singing in a booth
We're coming down the chimney and bringing you the truth
Like skipped out on a vacation after paris
Like maybe I can go when I'm a thousand dollars richer
Bored as hell all winter
I ended up spending more than a thousand dollars on liquor
Now pull out that chair for your grandfather boy
In fact your grandfather probably built that chair
Youngin, tell 30 years old I'm coming and I'm no longer fearful of earful discussions
Maybe I'm alone but I can sit home and die
When the message that I sent doesn't get no reply
Wow pretty girl you're so fly
You've been single forever saying you can't find a guy
But every guy you meet you don't talk you don't speak
He's a little too sweet or he don't have enough mystique
You're alone forever as a paradox in heels
Looking for another nice candlebox to steal
Don't rub steel wool on your own skin
Or act like your made of steel and you wont bend
Let a guy steal your heart then accept him
Its not love if there ain't a single imperfection
So fuck it
So here's a little gift set from me to you
The manifesto we are the black clover crew
This is more to us than singing in a booth
We're coming down the chimney and bringing you the truth
So here's a little gift set from me to you
The manifesto we are the black clover crew
This is more to us than singing in a booth
We're coming down the chimney and bringing you the truth
Like merry christmas everybody merry merry merry rotten christmas
Just kidding be happy</pre>
