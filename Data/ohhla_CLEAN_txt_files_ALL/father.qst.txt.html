[Verse 1]
Some knew my uncle Roc as a mob figure
But to me he was much bigger he was like a father figure
All that crooked shit he did he never let us see
Welcome me into his home givin' me family
A man to me closer than my own pops
My cousins ain't my cousins, they're my brothas and that lovin' wont stop
Never wanted the come I would never throw ya name
For personal gain, too much respect in my veins
Grow to me like your own and I never got to thank ya
Angry when I saw what they printed in the paper
Offered to take me in when I lost my mom
That's why I respect you more than any mafia don
I didn't know that man that did the federal bids
I knew a man who give the whole world to his kids
Knew a man who was funny and he had a good heart
And I'ma treasure you forever I'm a miss you uncle Roc

[Chorus]
In my life I never had a dad
But you we're right there to guide me down the path
Given me the things I woulda never had
Even though it's hard now that 'cha passed
I still move on, try not to be sad
I had you in my life I think god for that
And I just hope that I can be
Half the man you have to be

[Verse 2]
Grandpa you did a better job wit me than your son
No disrespect to my father but you got the job done
Taught me how to win respect that I'll never forget
Working hard all your life poured blood, tears, and sweat
Taught me honor and pride, and I feel hollow inside
Wit out 'chu in my life I'm so sorry you died
Took me from a boy to a man, and you raised me
Not just for me, you did the same thing for Jamie
But you were the glue that held the family together
Never thought after you passed that the family would sever
All of our ties, and just stop communicatin'
But without ya love I guess we started hatin'
But we was all there around the hospital bed
We were prayin' and cryin' I said goodbye then I kissed ya forehead
Watchin' my hero trying to breathe on a respirator
Yesterday the pain was even greater watchin' as you fade away
Right before my eyes, wishin' I could save you
Right until the end you were so strong and brave too
Named my son after you and you were so proud
Told everyone you knew about 'cha great grandchild
You held him in ya arms broke a tear couldn't speak
If only I knew, you woulda passed the next week
I woulda told you were my world thank you for your love
I hope your lookin' down watchin' over us from above
Because, you were the one who played the role model
Without 'chu in my life my hearts filled with sorrow
I guess what they say no one is promised tomorrow
Its true, Gods mysterious ways would always follow
You taught me life lessons I'ma carry for life
Pass it on to my seed, and try to bring him up right
Without these influences I don't know where I'd be
In the cemetery or in the penitentiary

[Chorus] - 3X</pre>
