Every nigga out there wanna be down with the crew
Some ain't got enough heart let me ask you this
Would ya be down like a soldier
Loyal, and do everything I told ya
I can mold ya into a warrior
Down for your neighborhood
Workin up to a G with the flava
Criminal behavior, on the mind
When I got ya back ya know I got ya back each and every time

Throw ya set in the air (c'mon)
Wave it around like ya just don't care

Throw ya set in the air (throw it up homes!)
Wave it around like ya just don't care

[B-Real]
It's time to exit that busta nigga
Get ya hands out ya pockets and your finga on the trigga
Let one fly, we don't die, we multiply
Throw yo set up in the sky
I ask you ?? cause you can't fuck wit this
Nigga when I got the Glock ya betta duck quick
Cause I ain't havin it
If ya got ya gat ya betta start grabbin it
I can handle it
Soy numero uno, mero mero
You know I run wit Muggs and the perro
Firin up that heater 
When I'm throwin up a set I got my nina millemeter
Los scandalous, killafornia, where I'm from
Dum ditty dum ditty ditty dum dum
I'm buckin on ya ass now ya know where I'm from
Dum ditty dum ditty ditty dum dum 

Throw ya set in the air (c'mon)
Wave it around like ya just don't care
Throw ya set in the air (throw it up!)
Wave it around like ya just don't care
Throw ya set in the air (throw your hood up!)
Wave it around like ya just don't care (got c'mon on!)
Throw ya set in the air (give it up!)
Wave it around like ya just don't care

Nigga throw your set in the air, nigga you know I'm sayin'
If you're scared nigga take your muthafuckin' punk ass to church
Cause this one from a nigga on the east side
Every muthafuckin' day is a job nigga
Gotta handle your business, niggas you get don't
You muthafuckin' cap on get peel back
And it ain't no bullshit
If you wanna test a nigga, bring it on nigga, you know I'm sayin'?
Fuck your muthafuckin' set up in the air

[B-Real]
Let me take ya to the dark side of the moon
Tell mama that ya won't be comin home anytime soon
Cause I got ya under my thumb
Nigga what set ya claimin
Betta be the same set I'm claimin
Take a look around count this amount of soldiers
When I'm chillin on the east side of town
And it won't stop till I'm done
Dum ditty dum ditty ditty dum dum

Throw ya set in the air (c'mon)
Wave it around like ya just don't care
Throw ya set in the air (throw it up!)
Wave it around like ya just don't care
Throw ya set in the air (throw your hood up!)
Wave it around like ya just don't care
Throw ya set in the air (give it up!)
Wave it around like ya just don't care
