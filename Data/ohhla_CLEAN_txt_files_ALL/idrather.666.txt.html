[repeat 2X]
I said I love havin sex, but I'd rather get some head
But I'd rather get some head, but I'd rather get some head

[Intro: Unk]
Hypnotize Minds!!
Three 6 Ma-fee-UH~!
And your boy DJ, Montay
And this another {Oomp Camp production}
Goin down

[Chorus: Three 6 Mafia] + (female) + {both}
I said I love havin sex, but I'd rather get some head
But I'd rather get some head, but I'd rather get some head
(I said I love havin sex, but I'd rather get some head)
(But I'd rather get some head, but I'd rather get some head)
I said I'd rather get some head, I said I'd rather get some head
I said I'd rather get some head, I said I'd rather get some head
{I said I'd rather get some head, I said I'd rather get some head}
{I said I'd rather get some head, I said I'd rather get some head}

[Verse One]
Ridin down the street man I whip my big car
I scoped a little sexy little minx, little bra
She make my dick stand like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
I hit that brake so hard, that I dropped my cigar
Pussy print fat like cash in a wad
I'm lookin like, "Damn baby girl, don't start!"
I'ma take you to my crib girl and screw you like a fraud
Or maybe get some head while I'm ridin in the car
Either way it go man a nigga gotta bust some
Storin my dollar, a nigga got some dust some
High as the moon, I'ma a goon like Plies
Spray it like Big Oomp spray, dead in your eyes
In your eyes

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I'm the one that supply that D
I'm the one that keep freaks with me
I'm the one that be ridin clean
that be on the scene with that Texas tea
I'm the dude that took yo' girl
I'm the fool that changed the world
I'm the mayne with the twelve inches
she love to lick and it made her earl
Always fresh when I'm at the club
Sippin Goose the plan keep a buzz
From the hood so I throw it up
and the other side they don't mess with us
Love a girl that do it right
Make my toes like curly fries
In the bathroom or in the car
or behind the bar she dy-no-mite~!

[Interlude]
Give me head {*4X*}
In the dorm room make me pass out, make me dead
Give me head {*4X*}
Wake me up then put me back to sleep, I ain't scared

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Unk]
Ayy~! Three 6, what's happenin, yooo
Hold on, hold on, hold on hoe! Stop lenme borrow yo' lips that's what I told her
Girl got that Aquafina with a good head on her shoulder
She whispered boy I'm hungry, so I told her she could come
And I didn't feed her nothin but some dick and bubblegum
She want mo' I give her some, I keep them magnums, I'm strapped
And if she tired, lay down, just place yo' head in my lap
Ay Big Oomp Records on the map, we keep that mouth wide open
I Clarence Carter that pro, from the East to the West I'm strokin
From the North to the South I'm pokin, every time this a hit it gets greater
Two choices that she got to make, she can chew me now or later
I'm 'bout that puh-puh paper, but see I love havin sex
And the mo' puh-puh paper, I know that head is the best

[Chorus]</pre>
