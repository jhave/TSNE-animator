[Verse 1]
Well..
(HIGH TIMES) what I experience when I hit the blessin
(LIFE LINES) Cuz this is serious, we will kill your best friend
(WRITE RHYMES) like no other being, spit awkward morbid shit
(BRIGHT WHITE) Lights what you see, keep walkin towards it
(SHINE HEIGHT) Web Entertainment, I'm gon' get famous with a
(FINE LINE) from arrogance, David (?) forgot what's in this
(LIGHT CRIME) I love eatin, livin, eatin, and breathin
(FIGHT MINE) Dumb bitch for repeatin the things that she did

GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY

[Verse 2]
Armed and dangerous, AKs turn your brains to mosh
Mix my weed with angel dust, feds label us notorious
Van Dyke nigga that love to bust. You laid to us
That nigga thats baggin and tacklin
Coming with strings and violins
That violent shit
On them beds we lyin in
We like to sin
High off speed and nitrogen
So much dope, it's toxic shit
You try to go to sleep - oh not again
I wouldn't snooze if I was you
You know what Gordy gon do to you
King of these dreams since '92
Look at all the hell I've took him through
Can't lay down cause you know who
comes right in and haunting you
Really wanna know what death like? Well, I'm the nigga to fuck wit
You niggaz can't bust clips (cuz) me and Fat Killahz love the dumb shit
Fuck the dumb shit, get the 'K
All the intentions to hit your face
Hit your waist, grab your shit
Peel this gat, spatter quick
I don't think you wanna fight, son
Blood will spill all of the night, punk
All these hoes, I have to hit once
Crack or blow, you got to try one
Got ten blunts, I got to light one
So what you gonna do, get high or what?

[Chorus]
Don't let me fall asleep
Gordy will come for me
He shows up in all my dreams
Chasin and hauntin me
GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY!
GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY!

[Verse 3]
(I'M A LIVE WIRE) Burn up the stage with high adrenaline
(FLYIN HEIGHTS) That purple haze, go cop some switches then
(LIGHT TIGHT) Son his ass, punch him by his ear lobes
(KNIFES SLICE) Cut his ass, gut him right in here yo
(MAD BITES) Don't let your parents know you blow crack again
(NIGHT LIFE) Got you sellin your soap mouth and ass again
(QUITE NICE) with these hot rhymes that I allure
(MINE MINE) Your not inside, but I'm in yours

[Chorus]
Don't let me fall asleep
Gordy will come for me
He shows up in all my dreams
Chasin and hauntin me
Don't let me fall asleep
Gordy will come for me
He shows up in all my dreams
Chasin and hauntin me
GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY!
GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY! GORDY!</pre>
