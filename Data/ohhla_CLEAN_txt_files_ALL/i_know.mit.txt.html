[Chorus]
I know crack, I know rap
Load a track, load the mack, flip the Lac, flip the Jag
I know, I know, I know a hustler's motive
So I make shit for em to slump while he's rollin
I know, I know

These niggas wanna beef in the west (be the best)
It's obvious I peep it in their swagger, talk, and their dress
I know Quinn, I know Mess, I know Juice they SS
Northern Killafornia hustler's they can tell why I'm stressed
Thousands of records sold out the trunk, they tilts the SS
The squaly with fake breasts, Denali wit paint wet wit
Sound scans that shoulda easily got us deals
But these square labels don't know how the streets feel
Cuttin them eyes on it through my relevence
Then use it for niggas that bang or be out sellin fits
Hear my shit and I got the buckets with them chickens in it
Check any whoopin on the yard and I bet you Slick is in it

[Chorus]

I know Kurupt I know Kokane I know 40 Gloccs pain
I was with Big Country BK until the federals came
Hip hops now pop I guess the gangstas done changed
It's cool for every nigga except for a west one to bang
Low lows in the video but can't hit the switch
Nigga can't believe he's singin &amp; makin mills of his shit
But it's cool I guess everybody fam gotta eat
But while you're shoppin your demo nigga I'll be squooshin this D
Slept on any nigga in a Bentley GT
Pull a C-Bo sell a mill without the TV
So fuck what they say, I aint tryin to hear it
They took out Ts and khaki suits and just changed the lyrics

[Chorus]

Gang brand baby of the west coast
Lace the game by Sir Jinx and Crazy Toones yea they made me the lefts most
Go promotin places only the crips go
Do shows with C-B-O and G-Malone
I know Snoop, I know Bad, smoked a blunt once with Daz
40 Water my mentor even chopped it up with Chaz
Miko and Lil Cyco yea they fuckin with Slick
Dego the Sacremento 6 1 9 1 6
Big Wine, Young Hooty yea they climbin with me
Tryin to help these Bs free from this conspiracy
But fuck it, I think I'll stay in SD
But don't come here lookin for none nigga cuz the city's all me

[Chorus]</pre>
