Chorus: Kristen Mari
He's callin' me
He's callin' you
But he's callin' me
That he loves me too
What would you do if you were in my shoes? (In my shoes)
Well, would you tell me cause I'm so confused
He's callin' me
He's callin' you
But he's callin' me
That he loves me too
What would you do if you were in my shoes? (You let him know)
I got a hole in here cause I just wanna know the truth

[Kristen Mari]
(Verse 1)
Turnin' a daze
Caught me by surprised
I try and hide the pain
I'm cryin' all the time
I'm sick and tired of being lied to (Lied to)
Really, girl (Lied to)
Really, girl (Lied to)

Hook: Kristen Mari
When his tendency tell you he's out workin'
Did he buy you some diamonds and say you're worth it?
Does he say that you're beautiful and you're perfect?
That's what he told me, too
That's what he told me, too

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
He's callin' me
Callin', callin' you
I just wanna say
That I think I'm through
I don't want him, I don't need him, you don't neither, girl
You can have him if you want him, you can keep him, girl

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

[Rap Verse: Baby Bash]
I got
Two lovers and I love 'em the same
But now, they got their phone numbers, so I'm callin' the game
And I don't know how to explain, but I keep it simple and plain
From this point on, thangs won't be the same, but hey
I had to do what I do to stay with both of you
Guess you can say that I want my cake and I wanna eat it, too
Ain't no lie, ain't no lie, ain't no lie (No lie...)
But oh why, but oh why, but oh why (Why...)

Repeat Chorus Twice</pre>
