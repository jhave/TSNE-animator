[Fredro Starr]
The pussy one, who is he?
He ain't gettin busy, ah, I'm gettin pissy
I'm havin fill nigga, shout muthafuckas
Bringin 96 to freeze in December, fuck all of y'all

[Sticky Fingaz]
Punk ass niggas make me fuckin sick
And I can't take it no more, gettin tired of this shit
If ya stupid ass muthafuckas don't quit
I'm have a fit, and ya gonna flip

[Sonsee]
Hardcore galore is what I'm for
And breakin punks jaws, let me hear yea y'all (yea y'all)
I'm the kind, that's swingin ya mind
Or play it, takin KO, and plus, wit verbal hay makers
Connections, whatever I'm flexin
Ain't no question, punks, prepare for more stressin
