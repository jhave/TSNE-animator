(do you ever have bad dreams?  All I have is bad dreams)

I knew a man with a son
Who bought him a gun
And learned shorty just how to use it
Taught him hunting and skining
Right from the begining
Built himself a mighty fine killer
But shorty got picked on
Beat on and kicked on
And all his classmates wanna punk him
So with tears in his eye
He catch him in a ride
And told his old man he went hunting
And he felt so free
Like his destiny
Lay somewhere out on the horizon
His heart went cold
He felt a hundred years old
And started pulling back on the trigger

[Chorus]
I think I'm gonna die today
And everyone who hurt me's gonna pay
How could such a short time be so long
How could such a young life go so wrong

(what's it gonna take for you to really make it in life?)

See me
Hear me
But don't touch me
You should fear me
Lived your life dearly
'Cause I'm seriously disturbed
That's my word
Straight to my mother
Wayne, my brother
Who found another one to play sucker
'Cause I ain't the one
Who put shade in your sun
And took all your shine
Watch me get mine
Feel my love burn
Me for my sins
Watch the world turn
The saga begins
Losses and wins
Angels and sins
Dancin' on top
Ahead of the pit
Don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
I can't hear a sound
I clapped a full round
I came to get down
I came to get dirty
I came to get even

[Chorus]

Momma, don't cry
Please, momma, don't cry
Momma, don't cry
You did nothing wrong
