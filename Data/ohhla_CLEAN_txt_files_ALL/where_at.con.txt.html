Three, two, one, four in the morn,
Gettin' the job done, tryin' to beat the sunrise, surprise,
Killas in disguise between your eyes lies your destiny,
For testin' me, hey, stop stressin' me,
Sick or psychopathic,

Leave your home accident prone,
If you leave your strap at home go no further,

Leave it to Beaver, man I ain't leavin' this,
Until your Mama grievin',
And you no longer breathin' trick,
You done messed up, 86'ed the wrong G,

Third Verse (Master P):

UNGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!
Creep up on the set and start checkin' fools bout my mail,
Cuz every fiend I miss, is a missed sale,
And the young playa ballin',
I got G's on the pay roll from Baton Rouge to New Orleans,
Across that damned West Coast,
Mister Ice Cream Man done hooked up with young C-Loc,
And runnin' game like a choo-choo train,
I got chicketts, seventeen for five, I'm the man,
And them haters still hate me,
One time on the grill but the rollers can't take P,
My little brother told me watch my back,
When I'm rollin' black,
(Why?)
Cuz Down South they quick to pull a jack,
But No Limit soldiers swell like B-12,
And life in the ghetto I mean is a livin' Hell,
So call us gangsters, keep one up in the chamber,
Big man got that Tec-9 and V, will strangle ya,
UNGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

And we bout it, bout it, so welcome to the terror dome Trick!!!
