Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Yea, ay, look
When she talk she so closed minded all she want to do is shop she so clothes minded
Wanna cop the latest before them other hoes find it
Material girl yet somehow I don't mind it
Probably cause she so fine it will blow your mind she black and Pocahontas
Laid back and blow that grind
Ass so fat wanna tat my logo on it so any other nigga that a tap, will know it's mine
I put in work overtime, let me cut mow the lawn
Guarantee I blow your mind
She try to play me til she learned I wrote a rhyme
That's that nigga from the Ville that I heard that Hova signed
The rap form Lebron, "Oh girl that boy the bomb!
No chain around his neck but better watch out for the charm
Your not my daughter um, but you can be my baby
Summertime, wintertime, anytime we looking for them ladies

[Chorus]
Ay with your fat ass booty and your curly ass weave!
Yea, I ain't tricking but I got a couple tricks under my sleeves
Yea now clap your hands one time if you know you look good
Yea if your from the suburbs of the hood

[Verse 2]
Yea, she said I got a man
Well baby I don't give a fuck
See me I understand, and I ain't trynna spilt you up!
Okay give me your number
And later I'm a hit you up
If you sleep I get you up
Ride over and pick you up
If it's clean I'll lick you up!
Yea do you research
I'll rock that ass to sleep and have you sleeping in my tee shirt
Just came home from getting my South Beach on
You know I ran the streets like a dog without a leash on
She tryna get her freak on come up on his ski jet
You scared of that water of you just scared to get your weave wet
Barely got your feet wet
Guess I know where we headed
Tryna see throw it back let's check your reflexes
Good Lord, didn't know what I was in for!
You can be my cuddy buddy - baby what are friends for
I spend up the tempo them other niggaz lazy
Can't fuck with nothing younger than the 80s I'm grown and I'm looking for some Ladies

[Chorus]
Ay with your fat ass booty and your curly ass weave!
Yea, I ain't tricking but I got a couple tricks under my sleeves
Ay now clap your hands one time if you know you look good
Yea if your from the suburbs of the hood
(Ladies, beautiful Ladies, ohh Ladies, all of you ladies)</pre>
