[Verse 1]
pass the gleco, baby get it poppin

Fox 5 guys in the club, with a fresh white tee
crist poppin to B.I.G.
I got my goons in this muh-fucka

I'm B.K. til I d-i-e (eeh eeh)
that's my word, bitches mad at me
'cause I won't get on a song with 'em
ain't perform with 'em
my bread stands on 'em

I got the Fox Brown fur, with the velour tag
and I don't drive 6 quarters, been gave it to Gav
let me ask y'all haters this, why y'all mad at Gav
because y'all see the young homie in the Mingle Jag
