Typed by: janis@betatesters.com

[Intro]
What's so different? (Uh huh)
Baby (Say what?)
What's so different? (Uh huh)
Yeah (Bom, bom, bom, bom yeah)
If you cheated on him
How I know you ain't gon' do it to me?
(Can you feel this? Bom bom bom bom, yeah)
I need to tell you something
Check this out
(Uh, Ginuwine, check)

You say you love me
But at one time you loved him
So what's so different?
Tell me if you were in my shoes
What would you do or think of me?
Would you trust me?

But you feeding me all this rap about
How it's different 
But it's not mentioned what you're doin' is wicked
Now I'm having second thoughts about you and me
Cuz this not how I want it or it should be

1 - 	You say you want my trust and
	Told me you were leavin'
	How am I to know that you won't do it to me?
	You're tellin' me it's different
	But what the hell is different
	If you cheated on him you'll do it to me

	You're creepin' on him for me
	But you say just trust me
	How am I to know that you won't do it to me?
	You're tellin' me it's different
	But what the hell is different
	If you cheated on him you'll do it to me

(Check this out)
Like the saying goes, you reap what you sow
And what goes around comes back around
To you five times harder
And I'm pretty sure that he's thinkin'
That you're totally his 
But you're here in my rimmed-up drop top wit me
All hugged up and all over me
Kissin' all of me
Is that to get me where you want me to be?
Don't want this to happen to me
So I'll drop you off, go back to your man
Cuz really, this ain't me

Repeat 1

Baby, uh uh uh, uh uh uh (Say what?)
Uh uh uh (Can ya feel me?)
Uh uh uh (Can ya feel me?)
Uh uh uh (Can ya feel me?)
(Can ya feel me? Can ya feel me?)
(Can ya feel me? Can ya feel me?)

(Uh, ya see?)
Don't tell him baby
(You don' went too far now, baby)
You won't do this shit to me
(Yo G, bring the bridge in)

Baby tell me one thing
How could yo do it?
What did he do to you?
Does he know he blew it?

Or is it just that
You wanna get even
Baby, if that's not it
Please tell me the reason
(Tell me, tell me)

I just don't wanna
Get caught up in drama
If you don't want him
Just tell him, don't cheat on him
(What?)

If you don't tell him
Me and you can't be
Cuz tell me how I'll know
You won't do that shit to me?
(Not to me baby)
You would do it to me

Repeat 1 until fade</pre>
