Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I've been working every day
I'll be waiting for turn of play
Call up my people
Lets play to town
Bring the fire
Lets burn it down

I've been serious all the time
And tonight I lose my mind
I wanna go out and have some fun
I've been working all week but right now
Getting dumb

Yeah we getting dumb
Get-Getting dumb
Yeah
We go out, get dumb
We drink, get dumb
Turn it up, get dumb
We all getting dumb. [x3]
We all getting dumb dumb

Watch out for the dumb dumb, watch out

Watch out baby its the next shit

Got so much soul like my home city

So we can party like an animal, animal
So come on, come on baby

Turn it up, burn it up
All my drinkers, just sip it up
I see nothing in your cup
Come on baby, fill it up
Lets fill it up, lets get it up
Got the purple heated up [?]
Where's my table; set it up
I got my crew, we rolling up
You know the name, no shame to mind
I got that, mhm hm, all the time
I can do it anytime
Me and my crew on the grind
Girl you know what time it is
So keep it rocking, marvelous
We stay on top like finalists
Burn up the floor like oxygen

Cos I know, I know
That you been waiting for the weekend, weekend
So we can party like an animal, animal
So come on, come on baby
Here we go, here we go
And check it out because I

I know, I know
That you been waiting for the weekend, weekend
So we can party like an animal, animal
So come on, come on baby
Here we go, here we go
And check it out because I

I've been working every day
I'll be waiting for turn of play
Call up my people
Lets play to town
Bring the fire
Lets burn it down

I've been serious all the time
And tonight I lose my mind
I wanna go out and have some fun
I've been working all week but right now
