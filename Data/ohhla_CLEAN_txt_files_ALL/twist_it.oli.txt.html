[Olivia] I make it hot

[Lloyd Banks]
Olivia, let's go
What's up ladies, I'm back baby
The boy wonder got the club goin' crazy
I'm two-steppin' in my armor in my 80
But I ain't in the VIP unless they pay me
It's like I practice stuntin', ma I have ya matress jumpin'
And I know it sounds like I'm frontin', but I ain't
Jerk jerk ya body, and work work 'em proudly, go and hurt somebody if i don't hit that
If you don't see 'em wit me don't ask bout 50
Cause if he was here he'd be standin' right here
And if you don't care so much about my fame
Then why you keep starin' at my chain? I'm doin' my thing

[Lloyd Banks singing]
From the club to the telly on a late night
Box of Magnums sippin' hen, finna get right
Checkout time ain't til daynight
From the club to the telly on a late night

[Olivia]
Ooh babe you know I like when you feel on me
Pullin on my waist I'm feeling energy
Gettin' kinda hard to keep ya hands off me (yeah right there)
So slide a little lower put ya hands on my thigh
Maybe i know you like it if that right
I'ma show you how to make it last all night
Now let me see you shake it

[Hook-Olivia]
Twist it, shale it, bend but don't break it
Work that body gettin' so crazy
Don't hurt nobody up in this party
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it
Twist it,shake it, bend but don't break it
Work that body gettin' butt naked
Don't hurt nobody up in this party
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it

[Olivia]
Mix a little hypno with some hennessey
Like the way this jig goes when it goes through me
Think I need to stop because I'm feeling' tispy (one more drink)
Baby now I can't stop cause I'm in the zone
Shorty keep it comin' boy I'm grown
I don't wanna finish this dance slow
Ooh I wanna see ya

[Hook-Olivia]
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it
Work that body gettin' so crazy
Don't hurt nobody up in this party
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it
Work that body gettin' butt naked
Don't hurt nobody up in this party
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it

[Bridge]
Go, go, go, down low, shake it fast for me
Work your body, don't hurt nobody, up in this party
Now let me see ya go, go, go, down low, shake it fast for me
Work your body, don't hurt nobody, up in this party
Now let me see ya

[Hook 2x-Olivia]
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it (ohh)
Work that body gettin' so crazy
Don't hurt nobody up in this party
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it (And let me see you shake it)
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it (ohh)
Work that body gettin' butt naked (oh yea)
Don't hurt nobody up in this party
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it

Twist it baby
Gettin' crazy (ooo ohh)</pre>
