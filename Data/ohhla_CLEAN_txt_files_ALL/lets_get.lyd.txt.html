[Chorus: Lloyd]
I wish I had time to get to know you but I don't

So let's get it innnnnnnnnnn!!!!  Girl!!!!
So let's get it innnnnnnnnnn!!!!  Girl!!!!

[Verse One: 50 Cent] (Lloyd)
I bet to you it might may feel like I'm in a rush
Give it to you how you want it 'til you feel you've had enough
Bottles of champagne will have us all in this position
A grown ass man now I need an intervention
We could make tonight the night baby if you just listen
Start it out slow yeah then we could get to kissin
'Cause all I need is, just a touch of your love, a little bit
(The spotlight on us ain't bright enough baby)
(Thinkin about you is drivin me crazy)
I do what I gotta do to get it, I admit it
The way your movin makin me lose it, let's get to it

[Verse Two: Lloyd]
So take my hand don't fight that feelin
It's alright to roll with me we just chillin
Your wildest dreams is 'bout to leave the buildin
Don't you wanna roll with me? 'Cause I.........

[Chorus: Lloyd]
I wish I had time to get to know you but I don't
I wish I could be here in the mornin but I won't
So let's get it innnnnnnnnnn!!!!  Girl!!!!
So let's get it innnnnnnnnnn!!!!  Girl!!!!

[Verse Three: Lloyd]
Hey, girl, I'm pickin you let's go
You gotta be the baddest in the club so on that note
Tell your friends, I'll see you tomorrow
And tell them that young Lloyd done taught you the backstroke
Now wait a minute, there's somethin you must know
I'm a blow it out but in the mornin you must go
'Cause as bad as you are, fine as you are!!!
I can't make you my girl!!!!
So take my hand don't fight that feelin
It's alright to roll with me we just chillin
Your wildest dreams is 'bout to leave the buildin
Don't you wanna roll with me?  'Cause I.........

[Chorus: Lloyd]
