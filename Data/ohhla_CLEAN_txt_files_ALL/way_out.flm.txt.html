[Verse One]
Everything that ya'll did we done done before
And the measure ya'll did it in we done done in more
Cats didn't just start livin' grimy
Death didn't just start tryin' to find me
Vest didn't just start gettin' slimy
Been in the streets and we know it's real
Been in environments where cats done got killed
Over some drug money, see now it's time to change the men-tal
Brothas is sellin' they soul over bout ten thou
It's goin' down, we scream Jesus who is the soul saver
One who experience pain death resurrect as the price payer
We need you now cause you're the way out
Left death and then stayed out
Look over life as the layout
The big picture, for so long afraid to accept what we need
One who would come down except He would bleed
Inject His seed in us, so many issues have been left untouched
So when Jesus left He left it to us
And I'm ready to bust

[Hook]
We need a way out
Take a look and examine the streets
The famine in streets
Young cats just be handlin' heat
Don't speak another word on how it's hard
Unless you pointin' me in the direction of the Lord
We know it's real thats why we need a way out

[Verse Two]
I done been through hell, and then hell again
Most definitely been rejected I just held it in
So now I see what you see, plus I feel what you feel
So it goes without sayin' that what is real is real
I done seen a cat lose his life
I done seen my mom lose her mind
Escape death like so many times
I live for Christ now, livin' life is nice now
I live that heavenly lifestyle in my life now
So hard to see through you with the truth cause you tellin' lies
And I can see to your heart straight through your eyes
That you frontin', drug money is stealin' your joy
Now you huntin', lookin' for somethin' to give you some joy
Now peep game, call His name and He'll save your soul
Watch you grow, slowly let go of struggles befo
And it'll show, other brothas will follow your lead as the Holy Ghost
Draw you in close, and teach you His creeds
Cause we need a way out

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
You speak a lot about my area
Been here lately? It's gettin' scary and scarier
Tryin' to tear down these barriers
In the midst of this I found Jehovah
I shout now before the storm's over
They all drunk but I remain sober
Remain a soldier, in this ghetto livin'
won't say I told ya, if you die un-forgiven
Offered you salvation, this crime we facin' dawg is so real
Without Jesus dawg there's no shield
Just open field, don't have to leave so I can find peace
Mercy and grace follows behind me
Covered by blood keepin' my mind eased
I trust God on a daily basis, in my ghetto places
Til I see better cases, off in my ghetto places
I must stay focused on the mark of the prize
Jehovah Shalome is where my faith lies
It's crunch time, so don't speak about the struggle
You share with us nothin' unless you show us how to escape the hussl-in'
In this war zone
