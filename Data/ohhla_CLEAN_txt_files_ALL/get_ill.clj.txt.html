Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

I'm the Ladies Love, legend in leather
Long and lean, and I don't wear pleather
Last of the red hot lovin MC's
Lookin for a little, that's my theory
It goes quick like lightning, too exciting
Lover of ladies, don't allow biting
Level-headed leader, toy boy feeder
Good love life and a rhyme biter beater
Looking, learning, the one you're liking
Listen and you will love what I'm writing
Ladies love, long, hard and lean
And now you know what L.L. means

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Come on now

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Everybody

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Everybody

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Lightning in the sky, L.L. don't lie
I can hold a larger load than those other little guys
My literature is the land's highest law
The man of the brand, one you look out for
I'm loose like the lace in your brand new sneaker
Release the bass in your face like a large Vega speaker
Li-li-lis-listen to my rhyme
Here to satisfy the listeners who stood on line
Bought tickets to see me kick it and wasn't late
The love every little bit of the cuts he creates
First not last, leader of the class, see
&gt;From London, Long Beach, and down to Tallahassee
Ladies are pleased, I'm not wearin Lee's
The Kangol is mine, the godfather is E
I bust your lip, my level won't slip
Clockin crazy dollars on the L.L. tip
Come on!

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Come on

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Everybody

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Everybody

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Loose with the ladies, loud like a ref
When I die, there will be no lovers left
I'm the little girl liker, legendary writer
Let's see, I never lost cause I burn like a lighter
My love is long and my lyrics rock loud
Lurkin shadow in the shadows like Little McLoud
I'm the Ladies Love, lyrical lord in the club
Ladies Love, the man you dream of

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys ]  Let's get ill!

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Everybody

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Everybody

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Never ever lost, not lonely or alone
You can call me the last Capone
Not a little kid playing with garbage can lids
Don't need a legal lawyer, I ain't doin no bid
Cause the ladies know my bass is low
Rockin L after L ever since the intro
Liberacce couldn't rock it like the long-legged pro
Two legs, not four like Lassie, I don't eat Alpo
Come on

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Everybody

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Everybody

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Everybody

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

All over the land they listen to my jams
Like a cherry lollypop when you're lickin your hand
I'm poppin and lockin, so I can give you a list
All of my lyrics are swift, so the losers never riff
I love givin em bliss, havin my name on the list
I'm the life of the party and my rhymes are priceless
Each jam is like a lesson other rappers must learn
Cold laugh cause they don't like it every time I return
Come on

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Come on now

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Everybody

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Everybody

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Come on now

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Sing along now

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

Everybody

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!

L.L. Cool J wants you to get ill

[ girls ] Aaaahhhhhhhh!
[ guys  ] Let's get ill!
