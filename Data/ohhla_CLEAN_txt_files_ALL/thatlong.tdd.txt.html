You gon save that?

Na na na na naaaaaa
Na na na na naaaaaa
Yea

Thug niggas don't live that long
(Thug niggas don't live that long)
Before they gone they'll be dead and gone
But I'll be waiting 'till they come back home
(I'll be waiting for you)

I wanna buy me a Benz but I'm fifty-grand short
I got to get this cheese without a nigga getting caught
2 freaks is in the jungle now
I'm taking care of mama now
My lil' dog caught a case, I got to bail him out
I got you bobbin' to this real shit
So reason why a nigga kill shit
That's how it is shit
See papa was a rolling stone
He left mama alone
She raised us on her own
Them bitches curious
Why I'm soo motherfucking serious
Hard times got me pumped up and furious
I want y'all to free all my dogs
Before I get my gun and start killin' your halls
Call me the butcherman
I take my beef straight to the man
I put it so only thug niggas understand
Keep bitches out your game get paid
Just remember and respect what the old girl said

Chorus

I got some niggas on the other side
One day I got to take a ride
And let them know I still represent the Southside
No more shopping at the flea I'm rolling D's and Lo's
I'm getting head, feeling bread from these sleezy hoez
And can't nann bitch forget that nigga Hollywood
Big ends steering wheel made of wood
I heard it was four niggas three shit, one ho nigga
I'm out the pen with you Howdy folk
Who gon die next
Who mama gon' cry next
Who sister get to wear the black dress
That's how we living though
Dead and gone before he twenty-four
Or in jail, but y'all don't hear me though
As I continue with this thug shit
With all this blood and shit
But all us thug niggas love this
For the love of greed and riches
But money don't need no bitches
So I'm killin' all snitches

Chorus

I'm doing this one for the thugs
and the niggas on the corner selling drugs for the thugs
Yes sir (repeat 2x)

If I was a hundred dollar bill
I'd make you niggas kill for me
Go to prison do about a hundred years for me
Get a gat and go jack robin steele for me
Just to pay a bitch bills with me
I'm dissing every nigga who got me fucking
A bitch better fuck for pregnent nuts
You see it be them same niggas
'Cause coochie ass lame niggas
(Last time) Learn some motherfucking thangs nigga
Now picture me as a killer
Young black dope dealer
I'm doing this one for my niggas
Who ride for this
Who even lost they life for this
And them niggas who survivin this
They don't live that long

Chorus 2x

Thug niggas don't live that long</pre>
