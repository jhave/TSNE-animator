Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Work work work work
Yeah you know I got that work
I'm why baby mamas leave
I'm why baby fathers kirk

[Verse 1]
Made it big with gogo
And I made it with that dough flow
This one right here for dc
This one right here for polo
Tee my pa palace flow hugo boss new balance flow
Here they keep a rachet close
And tend to think irrational
Bait bait bait bait
Bet I get like 8 of them
They clapping and we balling
No outfitting we at stadiums
(Bait bait bait bait) boa lil g, moco, cobain and tre
Floor seats at that wizards game
So close I could give flip a play
Ha my mojo back
Majors gon' bring hovo back
Shout out chicken getting chicken
Like my north east homie fats
Who that nigga she fool with?
He don't do the same
Babygirl I just move them
I got that goodman game

(Bait bait bait)
Who's on my line
I'm blowing up these bitches calling me (bait bait bait)
I'll snatch your girl if your tripping
She's on my line like I'm fishing

[Chorus]
(I got that) work work work work
Yeah you know I got that work
I'm why baby mamas leave I'm why baby fathers kirk
(Bait bait bait)
I'll snatch your girl if your slipping
Talk a little g not to mention we got that

[Verse 2]
Uh riding round I got some towson bait
She said I'm her hideaway I get her off like a holiday
Yeah that girl is top heavy for days
That bottom half is fishy. what you a mermaid?
Getting on my level joe nuvo new and yellow too
They not pulling indo green like smoking whent that rello broke
Never did I pedal coke but tony louis said I'm dope
And tony jr. said I'm the hope
Big homie hov said I am flose
And I got that bait they all bad
And they gonna fall in and out of love like my partner taz
They need something to keep I need something to grab
That's the end of my speech, I'm a need you to clap

[Chorus]
(Bait bait bait)
Who's on my line
I'm blowing up these bitches calling me (bait bait bait)
I'll snatch your girl if your tripping
She's on my line like I'm fishing

[Chorus]
I'll snatch your girl if your slipping
Talk a little g not to mention we got that

[Speaking]
Dc, maryland virginia this the part where I need all my sexy ladies to report to the dance floor
This bounce beat shit

[Chorus]
Work work work work
Yeah you know I got that work

Work work work work all my bait I got to work
Aww your slum that got to hurt this summers mine I got to work

Work work work work all my bait I got to work
Aww your slum that got to hurt this summers mine I got to work

[Verse 3]
I ain't stopping till the town gets on
These joint here not found at the mall
Shorty I'm a dog don't handle no broad
I be calling out game like miles dfarms
I'm stuntin' yo shawty from 124
Make her come a bunch of times she buys be a bunch of clothes
Girl stop being falatious this mercades is spacious
Black and white through the city guess this is gentrification
That fire flow the finest women I adore
I'm cool with all these broads in here but I do not date lucaya hoes
Bait bait who's on my lets go lets go

[Chorus]
(Bait bait bait)
Who's on my line
I'm blowing up these bitches calling me (bait bait bait)
I'll snatch your girl if your slipping
She's on my line like I'm fishing
I got that (bait bait bait)</pre>
