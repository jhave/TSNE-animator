[Jazze Pha]
Ladies and gentlemen
You are now tuned in to the very best
of the Phin-vale Anton-tindale{?}

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
You can't stop the boss - like a runaway train
You can not stop me (stop me)
I'm on go and still in the game
You can not stop me - you can't stop the boss
This ain't no red light district
Green lights I fly by
She say we look like pimpin
I say baby you know you can't stop the boss

[E-40]
The definition of a boss, let me put you up on it
B-O-S-S, Bread Over Sucker Shit
Ain't too many left all the real ones done went away
I'm built from a different brick, I'm carved from a different clay
Be careful what you wish, play the game for what it's worth
Cause bein a boss can be a gift and a curse, uhh
Hope for the best but expect the worst
They'd rather see you in a hearse than see you come in first
I'm gettin gouda my nigga, I'm havin paper my fella
Man I get to it my nigga, man makin revenue hella
I'ma tell you like dis, like Kenny Red said
I'm havin everything that a king should have (beitch!)

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
I sell a dream
I'm hella clean, this the life you wish fo'
I'm comfortable, you can bump the flow
Brains blew out, it's convertible
White walls, plush seats
I'm a boss at all costs, I must eat
Vintage statute, grinnin at you
Gold ones, continue spinnin at you
I'm a heavyweight, look at how I levitate
and perpetuate the rate of the Golden State
My cousin Earl knew I'ma set it straight
and set a date and meditate and regulate

[Chorus]

[Too $hort]
You can try
But you can't stop me, I'll be doin alright
Can't dilute cause I do it all night
I've been rappin on the mic my whole life
It's like I never stopped flowin, I keep goin
like a river where it ends you never knowin
I don't even think about it, I'm a workaholic
I date pretty young girls with perfect bodies
We bosses, gettin head in the office
All I do is cash checks and take offers
Ask Phalon, Calvin or Earl
When you see me they be countin the girls

[Chorus]</pre>
