[Chorus - sample from "Manslaughter" by EPMD] - 4X
First suckers disrupt the frame of a sucker MC
That can't count one, two, three

[Verse 1 - Mr. Lif]
I break sinks, eat for micra right away
Rip a side filet
Quick think of Paris Reich a day
With the flair disappear for a century
Come back to present time through a rhyme in your memory
Krueger maneuver, Hans Gruber Luger
Slide through the guard dogs, more than you could do
But Hoover Dam versus Redman
Outcome? Rapid water, rabid author
Louie Pasteur's your pasture
Peace, catch you in the after
Bloody acetate's risin out the acid lakes, lucid
New dimentia inventor, with improvements
You kid, walk two blocks, make a right up on Euclid
Get the team waitin, I'm impatient
Neck down, deck sound
Lazy, hazy, waitin for the next round

[Verse 2 - Akrobatik]
Feel your chest pound, the next sound you hear is splinter and bones
And all your broken down crew members' different moans
I got 'em locked down for kickin insignificant poems
The Perceptionists, a legacy that's writin in stone
Overthrowin so called Kings, that's sittin in thrones
A +Coup d'Etat+ to your fortress, we scorch shit
We roam the underground with a splif and a torch lit
Bringing light to those who be supportin that horse shit
Scramblin transmissions in your so calm headset
We got y'all little pansies shook and leavin your bed wet
They beefin up security like government death threats
When I roll through cowerin for cover's your best bet
Let's get it straight (let's get it straight), I've been hittin y'all off since '98
Here's a motherfuckin pass if you late
I'm more likely to hit you with the on time rhyme that's raw
Spittin lava hotter than the Earth's core

[Verse 3 - Mr. Lif]
Welcome to Hell, hear the bell? Time for dinner
I'm eatin mashed potatoes with Kato, that's my nigga
Laser beam, I made a fiend cry, I seen die
I mean death, hurry 'fore there's nothin left
I vaporizes, the vaporizer can't disguise
Into the midst with a list of things that fate defies
The saint describes a faint disguise
Really concealin the row more boaters, hope across the skies
This angel cry, when the mangel sigh
Cons to get the watcher with the Gothic eye
Get off of the hog and fries
And here's a ceiling
The virgin Connie squealin, a boat sailin
On the seven seas, inhalin
Some real plush green from Na Mean, she said 
A trap was set with factors that were not seen
Perhaps you couldn't catch her with the tractor beam
Next time I might attack you with a blacker theme
But shssh, the children have to dream

(*scratches*)
