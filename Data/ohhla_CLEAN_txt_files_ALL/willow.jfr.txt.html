(Chorus)
Willow is a player
She's got me going crazy baby
She's got me wrapped around her finger
She's got me going out of my mind
Playing all the the time
Willow is a player
She's got me going crazy baby
She's got me wrapped around her finger
She's got me going out of my mind
Playing all the the time

(Verse 1)
Everytime I see her
Can't help but to smile
And everytime I touch her
She makes me feel like a child 
She got me locked down
Got me locked, locked down
I'd do just about anything
To stay on her good side
And when she wants something
From me she won't be denied
Can't even go shopping
Without buying her a gift
Every eye tied to her
As she steps out the crib
She keep me up all night
On my knees as I pray
Cuz I can't sleep till
I know she's okay
She got me locked down
She got me locked, locked down

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
I saw another man hold her
Just a friendly hello
I know that it was nothing
But he took too long to let go
Boy you better let her go
OOOOHHHH!! Let my girl, girl go
I try to be tough y'all
Sometimes she make me so mad
Her eyes diamonds
Make me forget she's so bad
She's my angel
This world she's not of
Sent from the upstairs
Taught me that new kind of love (Love, love, love)
I can't tell y'all
What she means in my life
What make it so crazy
I met her through my wife
She got me locked down
Got me locked, locked down

(Chorus)</pre>
