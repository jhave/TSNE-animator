Uhh, yeah - today is Easter..
So what?  Uhh, yeah

When I rock the beat it sounds so incredible
When I put it down it's so unforgettable
Shootin this gift is just so enjoyable
Truth of the matter is so unavoidable
Right over the track you can hear my flow
But watch, for the train, cause it doesn't move slow
I like to gain mo', mental men blow
I know by the symptoms, the system is malfunctioned
But, how can you function without any plan
to put it in your own hands - but I doubt it
See we was all put here, so you could put a foot here on my neck
You better bring a TEC/TECH-
-nician cause permission was respect when I kick
For the mic check, and the almighty intellect
So let's take time to reflect, they haven't got me yet
Place your bets, rapps on deck

When I rock the beat it sounds so incredible
When I put it down it's so unforgettable
Shootin this gift is just so enjoyable
Truth of the matter is so unavoidable
Motherfuckers walk with they NOSE UP
And they all-seeing third eye CLOSED UP
And the green-eyed monster waitin IN THE CUT
Just to FUCK 'EM UP, I know the streets gon' SUCK 'EM UP
Turn on your television, check out the media
And let it captivate you, follow the needier
There's no experience, in your interview
30 words a minute, we won't be needin you!
So let your hustle guide, and don't you be afraid
And if you come up sho't, that's how the game was played
First it's Dr. Jekyll, and then it's Mr. Hyde
It was a groovy ride, now kiss yo' ass goodbye
And you can make it through, and you can make away
I'll keep on mockin you, until the break of DAY!
Yeah, uhh - uhh yeah, rapps on deck

When I rock the beat it sounds so incredible
When I put it down it's so unforgettable
Truth of the matter is so unavoidable
Shootin this gift is just so enjoyable

Uhh yeah, rapps on deck - rapps on deck
... Happy Easter
Alright cut it</pre>
