[Chuck D's Intro]
It ain't nothin but an us thang
And it's time for us to
step it up and respect
That level of sisterhood
That's been holding up
our neighborhood
And if it wasn't for our mothers
There would be no brothers
And if it wasn't for our sisters
There would be no misters
So it ain't nothin but a us thang
She's strong and that's a fact
Now it's time for us to
take up the slack
Step it up, step it up,
time to go to work

History hidden from me
To hide my identity
So I'd never feel
I am somebody

You've gouged my eyes
I see more clearly
You've tried to rob
My humanity

My spirit you tried to break
My soul you tried to take
There's no need to be afraid
Cause I won't do unto you now

[CHORUS]

Amen
All that we've been through
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due
Amen
It's time to know the truth
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due

(no no)
Because of my gender
(no)
I've heard no too many times
Because of my race
I've heard no too many times
But with every no
I grow in strenght
That is why
African-American woman
I stand tall with pride

You want to know what it takes
To rid yourself of me now
There's nothing you can do
Accept me for who I am now

[CHORUS]

(Chuck D)
Time to step it up, step it up
Better check yourself
I get vexed to protect what we got
Left her alone
Lookin for your own
Here it is I know what I'm sayin
But the klan ain't
playin at the range
Gotta step it up us to
discuss a must
It ain't nothin but an us thang
Rewind back to the time
Where the color of our mother
Had 'em call it a crime
Brother what in the world?
And the world says where
is the black man
Support the woman and children
Time to step it up, step
it up, it's playoff time
And the rhyme go to check
so check yourself

Amen
A new agenda's due

[CHORUS (2x)]</pre>
