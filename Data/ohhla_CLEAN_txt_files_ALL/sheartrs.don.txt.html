[Intro]
Yeah!
Kasinova Tha Don
This goes for my little brother...
Hehe, locked away facing charges
All the dead homies
Everybody that hadn't get they chance
Hope everybody can roll a blunt up to this one
Its kinda crazy how things wind up
You just gotta stay strong you feel me
Yeah...
I see yall (hehe)

[Verse 1]
(Wusup...)
How you doin baby boy I know times is rough
Momma really started buggin when they put you in cuffs
A lots changed since the day you got locked away
I hope you got an open mind I got a lot to say
Listen up I got a secret to tell
Momma had another baby and shes doing well
Named her Kaya she got a smile to set your soul on fire
I ain't lyin she had me blushing like my younger days
Looking like Miranda in her own ways
Its kinda crazy how people change
They wanna be in ya life but never will remain
Kimora getting big
You know she handle her biz
Running wild with the other kids
I hope you get the letters and the picture
To let you know your brotha still with cha
And I won't forget cha
So stay strong while Im focused on this hit song
I know your feeling all alone... It won't be long

[Chorus]
(Im missing you)
How could this world be so cruel and just take you away
I shear tears through the year's cuz you promised to stay
I pour out liquor every time your picture pops in my dome
I swear to God I know I miss you
Just wish you were home
Kinda figured it was comin
But why so soon
I wish I coulda stopped the blood from coming out of your wound
I get the picture you no longer put this call on my phone
I swear to God I know I miss you
Just wish you were home

[Verse 2]
From the first to the 9th grade we got it then
Livin this life we made was it supposed to end
From the cradle to the grave
You was my closest friend
I kept you in my head daily but its hard to pretend
You was the only one who kept it real
To my surprise we was 5 riding big wheels
When you cried I had to cry because the pain I feel
I puffed a lot to get me high do or die so you alive still
Remember school days
We packin goodies in our lunch packs
On the porch screamin punch buggie no punch back
I got cha picture and your love in a sacred case
Niggas can sweep with your blood
But they can't take ya place
When I hopeless wasn't focused at the moment you noticed
You was the oldest but you still demand not to show it
I kept them lyrics in my head
A mastermind and poet
Spittin nothing but the raw in your heart cuz

[Chorus]
(Im missing you)
How could this world be so cruel and just take you away
I shear tears through the year's cuz you promised to stay
I pour out liquor every time your picture pops in my dome
I swear to God I know I miss you
Just wish you were home
Kinda figured it was comin
But why so soon
I wish I coulda stopped the blood from coming out of your wound
I get the picture you no longer put this call on my phone
I swear to God I know I miss you
Just wish you were home

[Verse 3]
We went from whites to willie stunts
To lights and Phillie blunts
This life you really want
When nights get really crunk
Sippin Henny with many hoes
On the semis with plenty foes
They tell me I let em show mines empty you let it blow
For the love of this Blood shit
Got me thuggin n pluggin
We were rugged they couldn't cut it
Wrong brothas to fuck with
Then we ride because the moon light shines on us
My rear view caught a nigga creepin ready to bust
I hit the gas begin to flash and then glass gets shattered
I let the shot back from the mag and then his ass has scattered
Im hearing heavy breathing whats the reason
I handed him a slug to his chest and now my mans bleedin
And now I'm reaching just to stop the leaking
Im praying to God don't let him die on this weekend
So cold
That's what I'm told
The night begins to fold
A tear drop and then his heart stops
(man)

[Chorus]
(Im missing you)
How could this world be so cruel and just take you away
I shear tears through the year's cuz you promised to stay
I pour out liquor every time your picture pops in my dome
I swear to God I know I miss you
Just wish you were home
Kinda figured it was comin
But why so soon
I wish I coulda stopped the blood from coming out of your wound
I get the picture you no longer put this call on my phone
I swear to God I know I miss you
Just wish you were home</pre>
