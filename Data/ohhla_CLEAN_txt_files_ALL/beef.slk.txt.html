[Chorus] 
What 
Do ya'll wanna do (what ya'll wanna do, what) 
Do ya'll really want beef (do ya'll) 
And do ya'll want it with me (uh-uh) 
I don't think sooooooo 

What 
Do ya'll wanna do (what ya'll wanna do, what) 
Do ya'll really want beef (do ya'll) 
And do ya'll want it with me 
Nooooooooooo 

[Silkk the Shocker] 
I thought I left, all that drama dog, back in the streets 
I gotta result to riding low, and my homies in the back seat 
See, you know we the type of  boys that burn blocks 
I aint fucking wit them boys, them boys done turned pop 
They should of turned and run, but now they turned and come 
They wanna turn to gun, I gotta turn to none 
See, ya'll gone fuck around and turn me back to the old Silkk 
And them boys who know me, ya'll know Silkk 
They know I'm the Shocker, that means I don't play no games 
I say it directly, but this time I aint gone say no names 
Uh, my whole click, they with it, with it 
And you know, no ski mask on who did it, did it, (did it) 

Chorus 

[C-Murder] 
Now, Check this out 
Now what you wanna do, cause too many niggas are feeling played 
'Til I check 'em and correct 'em, and totally disrespect 'em 
Like bitches, they snitches, motivated by nigga's riches 
And want be satisfied 'til they die, or lost in ditches 
Bury me TRU nigga shit No Limit Records 
Respect us, and never check us, real naggers we causing ruckus 
And the 504, the boot, the south, the gutter, and the swamp 
Fake naggers can't hang or slang cause they get banged and even stomped 

[Krazy] 
You can tell these bitch naggers, don't want war with me 
I'm A Iberville nigga 'till they bury me 
Recognize, I'm a motherfucking soldier nigga 
Hearing screams from your family while I'm clutching my trigga 
My whole click, straight up scandalous, if it's beef, you will see 
Naggers heads getting bust, if they fuck with me 
These naggers don't wanna fuck with us, they betta get out tha way 
Holiday gotta "k", he knows where you stay 

[Chorus] 
(suga bear) do you really wanna mess with me 
Fool around and be my enemy {*repeat 3x*}
do you really wanna mess with me 
hand me the thang so we can handle beef </pre>
