"For those that know me..." [Rakim]
"For those that know me..."
"For those that know me..."
"For those that know me, indeed I like to flow"

[Encore]
Authentically raw wit it, see I augmented this industry
To submit to my will, all attempts to limit me
Can kneel, peel caps wit ill raps
Nothing convenes here till your camp gets smeared like pap
What you tryin to tell me, skills never found me
Workin for peanuts amongst jelly MC's, really ain't my steez
Peep game
I plot on different ways to make these styles ricochet through main frames
The day-to-day theme is turn these fake teams gangreen
My main vein's the only thing about me mainstream
You doubt me like the foes of Noah, embarkin in this Ark, the soul controller
While fools caught up in this Del used to blow up
You're inundating wit the out-dated
See all of y'all fall when this cascade hits
Yo D, watch these watered-down clowns get drowned
And lounge sound broken down in Cuba
Tryin to build ships off shit they bit
I spit that major play saliva, taylor-made for cypher sole survivor
Pay the piper if you plan to go inside my covenant
Better come in two's, matta fact come a crew to get you back
Executives, we wet you wit the hymns that leave you and your man
Packin, attackin wit verbal cataclysms
Leavin the average rapper drenched and grab a trench 
Guard against my El Nino lingo
A labyrinth of keen flows, concealed within the single
This is Waterworld

"For those that know me, indeed I like to flow"
Waterworld
"For those that know me, indeed I like to flow"
This is Waterworld
"For those that know me, indeed I like to flow"
Waterworld
"For those that know me, indeed I like to flow"

[Encore]
My scripts consist of H20, Hip Hop and Oxygen
I flip commission doctrines that make me Shake-Speare's pier
Upon this here tear I fear not
Killin furious wit the superior onslaught
On top of this isle solo, like Giligan wit a million styles
To throw yo' way wit capital A
We make waves, causin tsunamis to your armies
Splashin like the cracken on Clash of the Titans, writin calmly
Call me Aquarius, each full page a new age
I'm on a crusade to ranter your parade 
See 'Core is more than three-quarters of what this rap world secure
So this is Chinese Water Torture for MC's to endure
As I restore this reservoir wit my repetoire of metaphors
Step into the 'Core, better have your life insured
For supernatural disasters, I'm quick to cast a flame to your astral plane
It's bitch-made, get played like Conasta
Waterworld

"For those that know me, indeed I like to flow"
This is Waterworld
"For those that know me, indeed I like to flow"
Waterworld
"For those that know me, indeed I like to flow"
This is Waterworld
"For those that know me..."

[Encore]
What's an MC without concepts, I speak easy comin to offset your plumbing
Like leaky faucets, runnin my dungeon wit aquatic contraptions
The fifth fold's a fish bowl, kick hard as contractions
Wit skitzo-memos closed-captioned
Your lip's sewed cuz hardest to your fraction try to test me
You wouldn't tip-toe through Moses parted Red Sea
It's bound to collapse
So now what makes you think the sound of these raps
Is something different, I'm even pitchin the kitchen sink wit comin with it
Liquefied rhymes rhyme wax
It's time for jack-fakers to vacate, they take up space like the Great Lakes
Makin a great case for me to hate
Paint a picture clear as Evian, raps on tap like Savion Glover
Undercover, peeps wonder, why he became the arcitecht cuz none love us
We spark the shit that makes the blood cometh
Wash away your blockade plus your brigade
Tryin to sandbag clever words together 
The weather, the storm, porn's poured on cassette wit Architecht sweat
In the cores of us form when he pass Tech-12's
I delve deep in this abyss, inspect hell
Tell a fallen ang-el to eat a dick if he gets pissed cuz this is Waterworld

"For those that know me, indeed I like to flow"
Waterworld
"For those that know me, indeed I like to flow"
This is Waterworld
"For those that know me, indeed I like to flow"
Waterworld
"For those that know me, indeed I like to flow"

"Flow" *echoes*
