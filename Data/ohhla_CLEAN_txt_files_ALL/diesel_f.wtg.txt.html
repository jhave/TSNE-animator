[Method Man]
Meth on deck man, on DECK!
For e'rything routine right here
Routine, Gambino, that's that shit
The party is over, yeah, yo

I'm in the weed spot, pounds of purp, bowl of cereal
Cartoons is on, my favorite shit is The Smurfs
Now I don't slip when I'm down in the dirt; cause by this time
I done seen life, and figured the amount that it's worth
It's the first, cops is lookin for work
Got my niggaz all cuffed up, sweatin like a hooker in church
This old woman on her way to the church - she said
the neighborhood's fucked up, and we the ones that's makin it worse
Now that's fucked up! I hit the block hard, Timberlands is scuffed up
No justice in the system, look around, it's just us
They tell me only God can judge us
But they ain't ever met Judge Kufner
I'm looking at this cracker on the bench
Don't understand, I only sold crack to pay the rent
But that's possession with intent
Player, I ain't stressin, I'm a pimp
My bitches love the cocktail dressin with the shrimp

[Chorus: Trife Diesel]
(Killa Hill!) Cause we do it like how we do it
This is big truck style shit, diesel fluid
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang
Staple-TOWN, Park Hill, we just doing our thang

[Trife Diesel]
C'mon, yeah~! You fools don't have a clue, do you?
Moving them ki's crucial, troopin like Isuzu
Nigga your weed doo doo, we burn that Cali kush
My flow be on steroids, that shit that Barry took
Hurtin the game like the corns that's on your daddy's foot
My niggaz carry big guns, y'all niggaz carry books
You shook niggaz get stripped, beated and wiped out
ConEd status like Fab nigga, it's "Lights Out"
What your life 'bout? Nigga my life plush
I lost both of my parents, my nigga life sucks
Us Billy Boys hold toys cause they don't like us
Raw like the nose on a fiend sniffin that white stuff
Moving with the semi, eggplant pennies
Hoppin out the Bentley lookin like I just won an Emmy
Never been a sloucher dog, cause I'm an alpha-
-male got that product on sale redeem your voucher
Leader of the gang, I'm Spanky, you Alfalfa
Little Rascals, with no hassle, I will out ya
Sincerely doubt ya, and I will house ya
Posted out in front of your crib just like a scalper

[Chorus]

[Cappadonna]
Every time pick up the mic, I put work down
Cops don't like me cause I live in the murder town
My high school homies sold crack, through songs
You can't get right through the team like two wrongs
Mad criminal minded cream motherfuckers
Type of subliminal rhymes scheme muthafuckers
Can't shake the monkey, life is a bitch
Jake tried to jump me, wifey a snitch
Killa Bees wild like C-74
New York bitch, adolescents at war
Fuck the government, yo they made us this way
You a faggot - listenin to what that chick say
Escape route, gotta be free like furlough
Fuck hoes, nigga I don't care if the world know
Hardcore, move with or without Clan
Diss me in the cab and they murked your man
I'm a general, don with the crazy hype game
You don't like me, wanna feel my knife game
Killa Hill son, they don't like where I live at
Came from Hollywood so I fight to give back
Real talk, hard jeans and hard dick
Move in and out of state like drugs and garbage
Nigga feel me, or nigga feel that blast
ATF bitch, just guns and cash

[Chorus]

[Trife Diesel]
(Killa Hill!) Cause we do it like how we do it
Trife, Meth and Cap yo, nuttin to it
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang
Staple-TOWN, Park Hill, we just doing our thang

[Outro: Trife Diesel] + (Cappadonna)
(Straight up... Wu-Tang Killa Bees)
The best that ever do it
One-oh-three-oh-four, you know how we do
Legendary Weapons
Come in our section, get a blessing
Cause we don't play</pre>
