* deluxe edition bonus track

[Chorus]
And I ain't looking to the same, no more my nigga
You will never be the same no, more my nigga
I don't wanna play the game, no more my nigga
You will never be the same, no more my nigga
Now look you're the same, no more my nigga
You will never be the same, no more my nigga
I don't wanna play the game, no more my nigga
You will never be the same, no more my nigga

[Verse 1]
And I say this is for the hustlaz and every nigga like that
Married to the game, I'm here to tell you though, wife dead
You can go to jail or go home, it's your choice
Every nigga from the ghetto dream is the wrong choice
Countin' dough on the top floor, bad bitch cooking
Head it from the back another bad bitch looking
Champagne dreams, Cadi, yeah I wishin'
Almost done with the game beggin' up
What's the distance and all the niggas seen is things
And broken dreams, broke niggas styles
And there's triple Benz
If we're dancing with the devil at least
Teach us how to dance when the son of making dollars
Is like we never had a chance

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You niggas think you know, you have no fucking idea
Look at how I made it here, I have no fucking idea
See I started with a down rock flippin' through a down spot
Heat it so hard then a nigga need a time clock
Nigga over time, over grind, yeah you know
You know me I'm tryna overshine
Yeah that's brighter than the stars and the sky
And even brighter than them flakes in the pie
Luxury cars I lust them we can discuss them
Talking that convertible hard top shit and discussing
Pack a dubs for my niggas behind the wall's sick gang
Got my dogs locked behind the wall's sick gang

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I say now what they hittin' for
Cause you know they sky high
Niggas do, bitches do what them numbers don't lie
And forever do these words, real niggas do die
Even thing even birds a real nigga gonna try
The penitentiary ain't never scared me
Either I'm goin' or I ain't, that's just how it's gonna be
They want top dollar and the shit getting stepped on
Got âem niggas feeling like he being slept on
Sleep is for the weak when the work ain't cheap
Nah, so what's sweet but you can't be weak
They say what don't kill us only makes us stronger
Until they build a better case so they can lock us up longer

[Chorus]</pre>
