[Chorus: W.C.]
If you was born in the '80s then I'm probably your papa
Cause 9 times out of 10 I fucked your mama
9 times out of 10 she gave me drama
But, fuck that shit, I'm all about the dollar

[Ice Cube]
When you see me in the streets you can call me daddy
When you go see your mama know I hit that fatty
Back in the day, before she got ratty
I, had her ass in the back of my Caddy
And, you know I done it, I'ma keep it 100
Back when she had more ass than stomach
Back, before her looks started to plummet
She would call me everynight, beggin' she want it
I would go pick her up, then dick her up
Then stick her up, for some gas bucks
For some lunch money, and some fast food
Nigga was a pimp before a Nigga With a Attitude
And when you picture that I know you wanna get your gat
Understand atomic dog always get the cat
And if young motherfuckers ain't feelin' that
I wish she can open up, and put ya back

[Chorus: W.C.] (Ice Cube)
If you was born in the '80s then I'm probably your papa
Cause 9 times out of 10 I fucked your mama
9 times out of 10 she gave me drama
But, fuck that shit, I'm all about the dollar
(If you was born in the '80s then I'm probably your papa
Cause 9 times out of 10 I fucked your mama
9 times out of 10 she gave me drama
But, fuck that shit, I'm all about the dollar)

[W.C.]
Stomp down, bang loose for the cash figga
It's the candypaint blue '6-deuce ass lifter
Talk trash off of liquor then we kickin' yo' bitch ass up
wipin' the grass off your back nigga
I'm one of the few of the true last y'all
Reppin' the G's and I ain't easin' off the cash y'all
Disrespectful ass groupie new nigga
Can't do shit but shut the fuck up and salute me nigga
Lench Mob, Big Swang the chrome eight arms
Been doin' this since Magic was playin' at The Forum
When Boogie Down and Scott Laraque dropped
I was at the Raising Hell Tour fuckin' your mama in the parking lot
When LL was rockin' the bells, before Cardia and Chanelle's
I was skeetin' on the Gazelle's, in slow motion
But only if a nigga knew she was havin' you
I would have made the bitch get an abortion

[Chorus: Ice Cube] (W.C.)
If you was born in the '80s then I'm probably your papa
Cause 9 times out of 10 I fucked your mama
9 times out of 10 she gave me drama
But, fuck that shit, I'm all about the dollar
(If you was born in the '80s then I'm probably your papa
Cause 9 times out of 10 I fucked your mama
9 times out of 10 she gave me drama
But, fuck that shit, I'm all about the dollar)</pre>
