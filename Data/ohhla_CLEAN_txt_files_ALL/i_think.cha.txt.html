Mo' money mo', mo' money mo', yeah mo' money mo'
Yeah having money, is like a relationship know I'm saying
Ery'body, always gon get in your bidness
Try to break it up, try to get involved in it
But they really, need to mind they own bidness
Money don't do nothing, but bring you trouble
But for some reason I keep chasing you, I must be in love

[Chamillionaire]
You so bad that we getting mad, somebody that they wish they had
You're a dime and you know you mine, flipping with you right in my slab
Relationship ain't the same, as the others back in the past
See I tried to have someone like you, but didn't add up to half
Cruising it with my queen, the jewels the wrist and the bling
We moving and hit the scene, the movie the flick a dream
Painting the city green, like green is the coolest thing
You're oozing up in the jeans, we doing it as a team
I hopped in a different slab, that ain't got the easy take
But you looking so good to them, that they told me tell me pass
Never told me slow it down, the rims keep on moving fast
When I'm driving I almost crash, when I stare at your sexy ass
The longer we stay together, your appearance is looking better
Not better off with the fellas, you gonna be mine forever
They always loving the yella's, that's why I nicknamed you Cheddar
But they'd better not touch ya, or better see my baretta
You'll never leave by my side, even though they all try to take ya
Never turning on me, even though they all try to make ya
As long as you by my side, there's nothing I couldn't pay for
We'll make up and never break up, I stay in love with you paper

[Hook]
Money can't money can't, buy me love
But she's acting like she love me, cause I'm riding on dubs
Money can't money can't, buy me trust
But my money is attracted, to the backstabbers
Money bring money bring, plenty haters
It be looking so good, that I'ma prolly fall in love
Money, you bring me trouble
But I still think, I love you

[Chamillionaire]
She's as black as a African, but they call her American
Very thin, yeah she be messing around with married men
When he comes home, she's never asking him where he been
Cause ninety-nine percent of the time, she was right there with him
Chances of him losing her, in this life are very slim
Think money doesn't grow on trees, you ain't checking every limb
She gon be around for a while, she wants to marry him
She gon still survive when he dies, she'll have to bury him
When you know you're with a dime, they'll treat you like you're special
Broad that is sleep and you're sick, because your's left you
Bring her to the church, and the pastor says God bless you
Bring her round your boys, but be careful they gon get you
The cash in a hidden place, ironically called it safe
And you prolly leave it in the safe like it's safe, in the realest place
I hope you gon stay awake, cause they gonna enter and break
And the safe is the first thing, that them haters gon try and take

He introduced her to his mother, his mother said that she love her
And after that he discovered, his brother done tried to cut her
They messing with one another, saw her under the covers
And now he gotta show his brother, the meaning of keep it gutter
And all I know is I love her, I mean he loves her
Tried to control his temper, as he leaned in and hugged her
Just enough to get close to her, he screamed as he shoved her
Out of the exit heard his brother scream, you's a buster
Don't touch her, what you better slow your roll quick
Naw matter fact back up, right now before I click-click
What's this, told you to stop playing with me boy
Hurry up girl let's go, you bring me trouble
She's falling to the floor, he picked her up and he's grabbing her
Yelling out like he's mad at her, sounding like he's an animal
Pulling and grabbing her, now he already damaged her
He throws her in the trunk, and the talks to her like a passenger
And that's when uh, he hearing the tires peel
He's speeding out of the driveway, approaching the highest hill
Everytime that you called me, I came like I served you
Even the boss I use to work for, had the nerve to
Tell me I wasn't good enough, and didn't deserve you
Told me I wasn't good enough, and didn't deserve you
I fought to keep you in my life, and this the thanks I get
Well thanks for all the good memories, I think I'm sick
