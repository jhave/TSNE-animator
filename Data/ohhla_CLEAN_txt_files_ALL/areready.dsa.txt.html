[Soopafly]
Ay yo, if ya don't know now you know
I shine bright, Willie Dynamite, sit back watch the show
I'm forever rockin' the mic, sometimes two times a night
Examples for niggaz who can't get it right
I shook suckas and fleas, buckin' up cheese
The last thing I told a bitch nigga please
it's a brand-new day for me
Way too G from A to Z, not where the haters be
I feel it's my time to shine
Bling in your face until you're blind, matrix your mind
Visualize, look what you'll find
No more time, these uh days niggaz die for rhymes
I cock back-forth, with told the force 
I u-turn 'em off they course and run 'em from South to North
Huh, East-West, each chest get wet
I'm not biased or vexed, I'm just tryin' to keep it in text

[Chorus]
Ya bitch nigga, I came to fuck up your day
(Are You Ready?)
I'll make it hurt like oww-oww
I got somethin' to say
(Are You Ready?)
It's about to get raw, for bitch niggaz
I came to fuck up your day
(Are You Ready?)
I'll make it hurt like oww-oww
I got somethin' to say
(Are You Ready?)
Are y'all ready for this shit?

[Soopafly]
Bitches only want me for cash, I know it
I quarterback like McNabb, don't like to throw it
Keep it run my selection
I just like to fuck for free 'cause payin' for it's no fun
Trick bitch, stay out my car
Cause this bus pass will take yo' ass just as far
Don't fall in love, I'm not with you, I pick and choose
I'm on your screen daily like Pikachu
Beat it, you are just a hoe
These words comin' from a cutthroat nigga just to let you know
Here it go, I'll flip the game
Watchin' bitches shake they booty is the reason I came
Let it go, there's nothin' to blame
You talk about pimpin' a bitch but she got yo' last name
Let a hoe run game on you, shame on you
I came on her, that means I came on you

[Chorus]
I came to brighten your day
(Are You Ready?)
I'm not blind bitch, I know your kind bitch
I got somethin' to say
(Are You Ready?)
I keep my hoes in check, I got they panties wet
I came to brighten your day
(Are You Ready?)
Oh it's me girl, what you wanna see girl?
I got somethin' to say
(Are You Ready?)
Y'all ain't ready for this shit...
