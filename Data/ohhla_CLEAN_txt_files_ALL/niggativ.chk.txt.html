[Verse 1]
No buddah bliss
She musta missed it
Still bangin wit the anger
Kissed a soul sanger
Class of 78 sunset strip
Cause I been outta high 20 years with 30 somethinish peers
What a trip
Never drank beer with the boyz
But the love we shared was for the art of noise
Dump puff a smoke make me cough
But I'm not a chimney
So you can't call that shit soft
What turned me off
Swore their breath stunk
Plus/I never got out rhymed by a drunk
Now a style is your hair or something you wear
Who said it's getting zooted
Till your brains polluted
I ain't playin
This mainstain stayin rooted
Instead of be'in pimped &amp; then prostituted
Won't be the last time
Cause it ain't the first
So do I dare disturb the universe?

[Chorus]
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
--Goin' down, diggy diggy down--    ---Method Man

[Verse 2]
No U turn
I pumped up, hittin switchez
But all this talk reflect niggas &amp; bitchez
Where did that come from
Only the labels can explain
But they play dumb while they take from
I hit em up the rhyme uppercut
Tell me what have they done for me lately but hate me
Attack me might as well be damn Pataki
This hip hops in me
So they can't stop me
The rhyme animal has resurfaced
Wreckin all elements destroyin all irrelevant
It all comes down to this
What good is talking bout the hood
When you got mutherfucken madness
Am I ringin those senses
Brothers drinkin worse shit
Then they're be pourin in their benzes
I give a damn so I curse
So do I dare disturb the universe

[Chorus]
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
--Goin' down, diggy diggy down--    ---Method Man

[Verse 3]
See I always been a rebel
Now I got my own kind blind
Brain trained on the devil level
You don't measure a man by what he got
It's what he does, what he left &amp; what he takin care of
A brother like me annoys em
But I'm +Kool G+
When I +Rap+ about em it's +Poison+
Everybody wanna be Big Willie
Chasin down loot Dole &amp; Newt
Who do you shoot ?
I'm fingerin targets
While ya figurin
Figgaro Figgaro
Soup opera for the niggaro
I ain't chasin no movies like Jason
Or Loolapalooza cause I ain't no looser
Ruff stuff to the babies spread like ravens
To the heads of heads but I ain't crazy
Chorus to the chorus verse to verse
But do I dare to disturb the universe?

[Chorus]
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down</pre>
