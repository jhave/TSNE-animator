[Verse 2: Baby Cham]
Wow wow!!! I got my clip to di rear of mi, punks live in fear of mi
Dudes on di block wid dem glocks runnin scared of mi
I keep my tool near to mi, so don't just appear to mi
Neva touch my money no my money's near to mi
I'm in di club ballin in di V.I.P. booth
Shorty starrin at mi cause di kid's cute
This is why I'm hot you know it is di truth
She waan to get some lovin from a hardcore yute
So she made it very clear to mi whisper in my ear to mi
In har soft voice she seh hi in my ear to mi
Chicks who neva dear to mi, bringin over beer to mi
Girls throwin there underwear over here to mi

[Chorus: Mims]
This is why I'm hot (Hot) This is why I'm hot (Hot)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot)

[Bridge: Mims]
Aiyyo Blackout!!! Yo you know we got to kill this beat once and for all
Matter of fact this is how we 'gon do it
Light the fuse for me though, they got one minute to go
Mims!!!!

[Verse 3: Mims]
Now if you take the sun and multiply it's heat
Ten times over then what you find it's me
I ain't the reason why crack turn from cocaine
I light it up then burn slow on that propane
Yes I'm a don but not the Juan from Soul Train
Teflon don I'm a boss in my own frame
I could flip it if you need it I got it for real
If you don't see it then they probably ain't got it for sale
I got the East Coast bumpin me hard
I got the West Coast bumpin me hard
The Dirty South show me love I get aired out the trunk of they car
The Midwest like homey you large
So when I pull up in the car, with the invincible roof on the coupe
And them doors swing up homey all you hear is swoosh
That's a swish, I don't miss when I'm aimin for the shot
This is why, this is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot</pre>
