[Mary J. Blige]
Can't wait 'til we make real love
Because these conjugal visits just ain't enough
I'm really looking forward to a future for us
Baby don't worry 'bout it
I'ma beeee right here, waitin on you

Even took a second job
So they won't take the clause and put a lean on the house
I know it's gonna be a while before you get out, ooh
Baby don't worry 'bout it (don't worry)
I'ma beeee right here, waitin on you

And them dudes you ran with are foul
They been tryna get at me, ever since you been down
Even my girls are tellin me, I should end it all now
Baby don't worry about it
I'ma beeeeeeeeeee {*cell door slams*}

[The Game]
All I can think about is that honey complexion
And the way your skin glow when you slippin on them Dior dresses
I know you wonderin why I got you a Smith 'n Wesson
Cause them niggaz in the hood is the reason we stressin
I miss that gangsta love and that lil' affection
Them butter soft lips when you kissin my chest and
Mary I put nuttin above you
And behind that vest I got a heart ma gangstas need love too

[Mary J. Blige]
Some think the worst of you
They portray you as a man, it's not that far from the truth
You were caught up in the game and now it's, caught up to you
Baby don't worry about it
I'ma beeee right here, waitin on you

[The Game]
It used to be caramel skin tones, Sprewell rims on
Glass house, ass out, Jacob watch, gemstones
Bandanna, Nike Airs, tennis bracelet, wife hair
Black rag, do or die, .45 right here
Every time I was down, you was always right there
Whenever visitin hours came, I know my wife there
So pink diamonds right here, chain hang, ice there
The reason for my tattooed tear - I need you to hold me down

[Mary J. Blige]
I'll be waiting on you (I'lllllll)
I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here whenever you call me babe)
I'll be waiting on you (ooooh-ohh)
Baby don't worry about it
I'ma be right here, waitin on you

[The Game]
I'm locked up countin the days down
Tryna hold my head cause the penitentiary ain't no playground
I'm dyin in here and I don't know how you stay down
in the shootin range twice a week bustin that trey-pound
I would never ask you to wait around
But how do a white sandy beach in St. Tropez sound?
And no more outta town trips on that Greyhound
Just me hittin like a beat from Dr. Dre, out

[Mary J. Blige]
I'll be waiting on you (I'll be waiting)
I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here, for you ba-by)
I'll be waiting on you (I'lllllllll)
Baby don't worry about it (don't worry babe)
I'ma beeee right here (I'ma beeeeeeee) waitin on you

I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here waitin for you baby)
I'll be waiting on you (you know I-hiiiiiii will)
I'll be waiting on you (whenever you need me baby)
Baby don't worry about it (I'll be right here, I'll be right here)
I'ma beeee right here, waitin on you (don't you worry)

I'm lookin for a future with you baby
Wanna see you real soon, real soon, real soon
I'll be right there, I'll be right therrrrre
(Baby don't worry about it)
Don't worry, don't worry
(I'ma beeee right here, waitin on you)
Don't worrrrrrrrrrrrry...</pre>
