[ VERSE 1: Tung Twista ]
Intro, I break a, break a brother ten fold
Oh, 10-40, stomp em like a dinosaur
Poor excuse for an MC, so-so singers
The things I bring'll snap like fingers
Rugged hip-hop, I'm gettin funky like a cheap perfume
Doom, take em from the womb to the tomb, whom
It may concern, I return from the mentally dead
To fly a sleep sucker duck's head
A thouroughbred in this talent, I be snappin like I'm coo-coo
Try to fade my spade, you made a boo boo
Suckers say 'ooops', troops, I spank em if they rap happy
Never calm, cause I'm snap happy

[ CHORUS ]
Am I snap happy? (mh-hm)
Tell me am I snap happpy? (mh-hm)
Tell me am I snap happpy? (mh-hm)
Yo, tell me am I snap happpy? (mh-hm)

[ VERSE 2: Tung Twista ]
Snap happy - snappin on those who think I rap crappy
The Tung is snappy, rougher than nappy, you can't outrap me
Punk, with suckers I toy, I'm stronger than a droid
I don't avoid the noid, I destroyed the noid
So I gotta make a scrub pay hay
Suckers I slay, they lay stinkin in the subway
Focus, my rhythm will scrub, say rub-a-dub-dub
Cause I'ma step into em like a bathtub
I make em run like waterfalls, use your eyes for pool balls
Then run through rappers like school halls
I'm breakin sucker punks' backs
Facts on wax, when I step, instead of footprints, I leave tire tracks
My rhythm be delicious while
I flow, the skunk of this, funk of this with a dramatically vicious style
I destroy your phoney hip-hopness like the Lochness 
Monster, just because I want ta
1 to 2, I'm comin through
Swig em like a brew, ooh
You think I bit off more than I can chew?
I break a sissy up with no twist
Don't make my tongue flappy
I still can be labelled as snap happy

[ CHORUS ]

DJ Jihad get loose

[ * DJ scratches* ] (Hit me)

[ VERSE 3: Tung Twista ]
I snap and make em yield
Spin my tongue like a windmill
And crack your skull like a windshield
Show me where a sucker makes a error, I give him terror
Be smooth as Aloe Vera, they run like mascara
I turn em over like a page, engage
I eat em with rage and trap the duck behind my rib cage
Flow, my jock'll make em blow
Want me to take em slow
I flow speed till they can't take no mo'
Get the urge to see what I'm servin, bee
I make an emergency for the sucker to get surgery, word to G
You thinkin what I said'll miss
But I'm the head of this, what I said'll diss
Cause it's a mega-diss
If you sleep get into bed of this
But if you wake up, I'ma fly that dreaded head like Pegasus
I'm a son, but for some reason they wanna call me the rap pappy
I guess it's cause I'm snappy

[ CHORUS ]
