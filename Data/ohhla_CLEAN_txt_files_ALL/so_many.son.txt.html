Hey sport is a thought from the old school crew
a serious situation that we all go through
it deals with our feelings so dig what I say
It's like a day when nothing seems to go your way
Yo bust this two people that really like each other
he says there's no one else and she claims there is no other
Yo Slick Rick hit me with that teenage love
bout that same way I'm a hit you with that songodsuns
I remember you dancing in my room to Sean Paul
much more than a summer run as you were my baby doll
I loved you under my wing much more than anything
The way you made me see the forever and everything
dancing in rhythms that I couldn't't understand
If only I knew I would of never let go your hand
And a but then you left me probably for your ex
You can't keep on running from one onto the next!
You disappeared in the night to bomb trains
Had a fear I wrote these songs of pain
Dedicated to the night you didn't call

Write your name on the wall its like over and over again
there's so many more words
And some of my friends don't like you there's
So many more girls and a
I feel so lonely that I'm a earl but
tonight I fall in love with you over
And over again

I heard you got a tattoo of some stars on your side
hoping that guys think that you're a star inside
But they just wanna get inside and I know
because I wanna get inside your head
And find out how you made me feel so dead
I slowly bled the ink runs away from me too
You jocked that fool from blink 182
But I'd rather kill myself than have you think I'm hating you
We used to laugh and say well never be apart
And a my other half in fact my better part
You got an autograph from saber on his art
now I wanna a autograph a saber through my heart
And its like your too young to know love
I'm to old to say no to love
I was hoping you would grow to love
something that wasn't there at all

Write your name on the wall its like over and over again
there's so many more words and some of my friends don't like you
there's so many more girls and a I feel so lonely
that I'm a earl but tonight I fall in love with you over and
over again

The day you made yourself less accessible
was the day I began to stress these decibels
I first started hating myself around the time you started hitting
freights by yourself
It's like part Puerto Rican and part Cherokee
your heart is what I'm seeking apart from therapy
I say I need better but I still need you
spray you close to my letters like my heart that bleeds through
I could never be a writer or a bomber
to many words and its not for me to farmer
But then again I probably could too
I seem to be stuck on you

It's like over and over again
there's so many more words
And some of my friends don't like you
there's so many more girls
And a I feel so lonely that I'm a earl
But tonight I fall in love with you over and over again

saw you at the show
You pretended that you never knew me
I don't know I guess ill act like I rented you like a movie
You always have guys around to fall all over you
I can't believe I hit the ground when I fell in love with you
And I got up cell phone rang it was this girl named *******
she was ready to hang
like BSC said boy do the damn thing
cause your boys back again
It's like over and over again
there's so many more words
And some of my friends don't like you
there's so many more girls and a
I feel so lonely that I'm a earl
But tonight I fall in love with you
over and over again
there's so many more words and
some of my friends don't like you
there's so many more girls and a
I feel so lonely that I'm a earl
But tonight I fall in love with you
over and over and over and over and over and over again
there's so many more words and some of my friends don't like you
there's so many more girls and a I feel so lonely that I'm a earl
But tonight I fall in love with you over and over again</pre>
