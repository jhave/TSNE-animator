[Snazz D]
Electronic clout support for remote control sound guards
Khoisan with a Walkman using hertz memory cards
Digital accents for CD language
Perceptions managed by a modern day savage
Eating food for thought processes of elimination
Real time rhymes versus artificial insemination
Visions in DVD technological landscapes
Flocs of robo-pups, microchipped handshakes
Hottentot Hop, drum patterns for ritual meditation
Put souls on internet, release infrared
Computerized gardens, electrified trees
Virtual weed, wooden condoms enhance your needs
Sippin' uMkomboti through a Walkie-Talkie
With my wi-fi electronica on a hologram
Through my third eye scanner I write laptop hieroglyphics
Satellite appetite for a homemade image, (it's the Hottentot Hop)

[CHORUS]
It's the Hottentot Hop Bantu 1,2
Khoisan walkman, gumboot kung-fu
Kalabash cash, tribal wars indoors
Telepathic ancestors for traditional dancefloors
(repeat 2x)

Bantu 1,2,... (Ba-Ba,..)
Bantu 1,2,... (Ba-Ba,..)

[X-Amount]
I'm runnin' with the spear of a nation these days called a AK
Gunpowder scent the animal spray, make me the prey
It's a jungle in here, a desert when it comes to money
A Miracle, know a mirage in the Kalahari
Hottentot hop graphic design safari
Taking pictures of a monkey with keys to the golden city
Swinging from tree to tree, I'm sick of smoking leaves
Save them for the tea curing every unheard of disease
Like anxiety in my reality
See murder diamonds aren't the only things that be stressing my prosperity
I'm eating roadkill, drunk drivers be serving me speed
Aim efficiency means MC's can't arrive alive lately with rhymes
This time it's real paper now, nickels and dimes
Shine like silver killing vampires, take your life back from these killers
Living off the empire trying to survive in nature rock hard
But perfectly round like the equator, no borders my passport's scared
My skin's indigenous, this trip begins &amp; ends with ass the size of Sarah's
Crushing your cranium, Megabrain draining these lies
For the truth about platinum it's money sellouts, bling for they buyers

It goes Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Bantu 1,2
It goes Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Bantu 1,2
(repeat 2x)

From a Homemade image (X-Amount)

[CHORUS]
It's the Hottentot Hop Bantu 1,2
Khoisan walkman, gumboot kung-fu
Kalabash cash, tribal wars indoors
Telepathic ancestors for traditional dancefloors
(repeat 2x)

Bantu 1,2,... (Ba-Ba,..)
Bantu 1,2,... (Ba-Ba,..)

[Fat Free]
I'm drinking 80 proof beverages with my elders under thatch-roots
When looking for truth, tribal groups tap into ancestral roots
Artistic youth paint rocks with ancient crayons
Applying warpaint on my arms to perform a seance
It's tradition, african drums beat in unison
Bushman aborigine &amp; peep each other wisdom round the bush fire
The north star light in the sky, the Hottentot gatherer lets his corners dry
Cause each gives to native tongue, babylon is advanced
Fore-glance of tabu, who is who at the week dance
My peeps plan and got mad cattle per capita
Lobola from a face of Africa, chibuku rump shake shaker
She fell for this man from Botswana land, we deep
Kiwi sweet now she got diamonds on the soles of her feet
Celebrate with the Kalabash, walk long distance for water taps
My grandma gramophone use banana peels for slip mats
and now the Hottentot.. yeah.. hm.. and now the Hottentot Hop!

[CHORUS]
It's the Hottentot Hop Bantu 1,2
Khoisan walkman, gumboot kung-fu
Kalabash cash, tribal wars indoors
Telepathic ancestors for traditional dancefloors
(repeat 2x)

Bantu 1,2,... (Ba-Ba,..)
