Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Done ran all through the club
Tryna leave a nigga for nothin'
I used to see me as your husband
Even though I'm out here thuggin'
I'm missing all your touching
Ain't fell in love with no pussy
Ain't fell in love with no pussy
Done ran all through the club
Tryna leave a nigga for nothin'
I used to see me as your husband
Even though I'm out here thuggin'
I'm missing all your touching
Ain't fell in love with no pussy
Ain't fell in love with no pussy

[Verse 1]
You want all my money
You want all my fame
You wanna run to the pole
Tryna fuck up my name
Ain't never been dishonorable
I took a chance on you
I even took you around my homies
Something I never do
I'm drinking and flashing the Rollie
Either you stay or you're going
I'm never gon' toast you
But from the beginning knew I could afford it
Here, carry my forty
And you thought I would... oh, baby

[Chorus]
Ain't fell in love with no pussy
Ain't fell in love with no pussy
Tryna leave a nigga for nothin'
I used to see me as your husband
Even though I'm out here thuggin'
I'm missing all your touching
Ain't fell in love with no pussy
Ain't fell in love with no pussy

[Verse 2]
Fuck you on your bed
Fuck you laying over
Fuck you just there
Fuck you in the car
Fuck you in the club
Fuck you in the studio
Never made love
Fuck you on your knees
Fuck you in the butt
Fuck you drunk
Fuck you, beat it up
Just fuck you everywhere
Fuck you everywhere
Fuck you from the back
Fuck you, pull your hair
Fuck you when you choke me
Fuck you like a teen
Fuck you like a king
Fuck you like a queen
Fuck you like she done
Fuck you like she livid
Fuck you like I'm rich
Fuck you like I'm broke

[Chorus]</pre>
