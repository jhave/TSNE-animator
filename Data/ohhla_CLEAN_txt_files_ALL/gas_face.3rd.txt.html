[MC Serch]
Aiyyo man, my labelmate Don Newkirk
Man step to him

[Don Newkirk]
Thanks Serch!
And now... for the Prime Minister
Sinister.. Pete.. N-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hice!
Nice Nice Nice

[MC Serch]
Kick em in the grill Pete!

Verse One: Pete Nice

Gas, past tense, made facially
3rd Bass'll express, KMD
Three blind mice on sight
Zev Lover, gave it the first light
A grin shows a trick up a sleeve (HUAHAH)
What a tangled web they weave
Deceivers, stupefied through fable
say Let's Make a Deal at the dinner table
Put you on tour, put your record on wax ("Trust me!")
Sign your life on the X
You eXit, X-off, but what you really get:
A box of Newports, and Puma sweats ("Damn!")
Tex feeds and frowns upon Emus
To give up Gas Face he drinks from a Thermos
Sub Roc cut at you with a clipper
Gas Face given, I beg to differ

[MC Serch]
Pete that was real def man but I gotta get serious now
Aiyyo Don, step to em again

[Don Newkirk]
Everybody.. MC Serch!

Verse Two: MC Serch

Black cat is bad luck, bad guys wear black
Musta been a white guy who started all that
(Make the Gas Face!)  For those little white lies
My expression to the mountainous blue eyes
Then form a face, and shake my skull cap
Dismiss the myth, that evil is not black
but opposite spectrum, this done by red man
with horns on his head, laid down the ill plan
Got all his helpers, said, "Make it snappy!
Tell all the people that their hair can't be nappy!"
Blonde and blue-eyed, or dark-skinned half a G
A disease, created by leprosy
Don't speak of bleach, bend them to right
Say, "It was night WAY before the light"
Put aside spooks, Serch leaves a trace
I've set em correct with the effect of the Gas Face

[MC Serch]
Next up Don

[Don Newkirk]
A *SPECIAL* appearance by KMD's.. Zev, Love, ehhXssss!

Verse Three: Zev Love X

A Gas Face, can either be a smile or a smirk
When appears, a monkey wrench to work one's clockwork
Perkin his brim to the rim of my cup
Don't tempt me, you're empty, so fill'er up!
Is I'm talkin coffee or cocoa, is you loco?
Cash or credit for unleaded at Sunoco
KMD and 3rd Bass is just ace in the hole
I mean soul, so make the Gas Face (HUAHAHA)
Damn, if looks could kill
You look like host was a ghost from your grill
But still, what's the new fed, to recollect
to our passing phase to facades to Eddie Decker
for my label reads Hood, street might have a tattoo
Don't pick any card or no rabbit from my hat
Never a magician if I ever tricked em
"Oh shit!"  Another Gas Face victim

[MC Serch]
There it is, yo fellas man
Why don't you step to the mic man?

[Zev Love X]
That's how I kicks it, for 80-deca
