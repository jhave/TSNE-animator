[Scarub]
I float with the sensation of flying underwater
Aqua acrobatics like dolphins hittin' backwards tuckin' in
And then returning or plungin' in
Swimming deep in the sky
Diving got a eagles eye to keep a close watch on you watchin' me
Watch it now
We futurisitic
You could miss it if you blink
Some shootin' stars will fall with this pad of ink
If we were in the same crew yo i'd have a fatter link
Just sit and think about it while we push it to the brink and route it
Through your city through your town come on now we rip it down
Dynamic duo shining like a jewel
Deep within your pool of thought come on just rock with me

[Raashan Ahmad]
I float with the elation of sunshine and rain
Similar gain frame the aim on point we rock
Citizens I'm hittin' them and gaining momentum
When spittin' truth and venom all these suckas is sickenin'
A yo scarub (it's like a bodyblow)
Crown city fa show interlock with the four-four
Makin' it grow rockin' the show hittin' the floor dance fever
People let me see ya started on the kick but then I ended on the
I know you love it so I do it one more time
The flow and vibe feelin' blend rollin' up the skin I'm in
H20 and cinnamon flavor and some vitamins

[Chorus]
We came to give you what you want
Counterbalance it with what you need
What you want
What you need
What you want
What you need
What you want
What you need

[Rashaan Ahmad]
It's the end of the world as we know it
Yeah it's the changing of times
For better or worse or which way you're hopping the line
Will you find yourself victorious or on the side of the dying
And when it's all said and done was it fun or wasted on crying
We got them hot compositions for them cold city nights
When ain't nothing going right and you searching for the light
See as the planet jumps through orbits like elephants through hoops
Peep the circus of affairs best be aware of this troop
We combine to give you what you want
Counterbalance it with what you need
The outcomes alternative medicine open up let us in
Soothing with music so y'all take heed
Plant the seed water and weed
Marinate with some spice we ready to feed
I be backpackin' all alone lost in the zone
Lost in my dome getting grown movin' along
Pondering the universe while I'm hitting up dag
Poetics I've had to slave to the system I tag
It ain't all bad
Balance got this dude so rad
Words inspire so I love vocab
Just a baby on this earth but through hunger and thirst
I got girth and on a steady quest for worth come on
First we all in together now come on
Move with the rhythm we can work it out

[Chorus]
We came to give you what you want
Counterbalance it with what you need
What you want
What you need
What you want
What you need
What you want
What you need

[Rashaan Ahmad]
Firewater and grape soda
I said a haircut and sunshine
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Los Angeles
Oakland and frisco
Scarub and crown city
Long time comin'
But it's what you need</pre>
