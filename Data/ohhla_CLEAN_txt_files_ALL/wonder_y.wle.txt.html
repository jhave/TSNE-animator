"Wonder why" [x3]

[Intro] [Wale talking]
Back on my hip hop shit ladies and gentlemen. Yeah

[Verse One] [Wale]
Don't wonder why my hours long and I never tire
Because a nigga grind, well exceed a 9 to 5
Who fear of 9 to 5, seein' me again?
I came through with the Z's seaman on my pen
That's A.I.D.S. to the ill
L.A to the Chilly
East coast steal them W's that's raised up for real
Fellatio fetish broads know me, where I live
Brought dimes from Brazil, fuck the currency ya dig?
Still they wonder how I seem so confident
One can seem pompous, meanin' you just need to talk a bit
I ain't your regular rapper who just be talkin' shit
Listen to it a little closer, hear the gospel in it
I rhyme a noodle through the studio it's hallelujah 
You dudes peep too early like ?
I should rhyme in the sewer
Pepé Le Pew my music
You ain't the reason why they came like the fries at Hooters
I'm beside the future
They can't get rid of it
I'm past/passed present, everyday is December 25th
Jolly ol' St. Nicholas take a pick
Admire my style, flier than kid Icarus 

[Chorus] [Mike Posner]
Just because you know me, you don't know me
I've been tryin' to do it big since '03
And I got a little big keepin' low key
Tryin' to keep up in my mind and you wonder why
Oh my mind
Don't wonder why
They're stayin' on my mind

[Verse Two] [Big Sean]
Better than whoever nigga, as is
I'm always dressed up but I never slack shit
So good I feel like I could be the 8th Wonder of the world
And the 9th is on the track bitch
I don't track until I go hoarse
Hear my voice and they pray that they never hear the chorus
Cause thinkin' logical to me was illogical
So I took a 'possible' and turned it into optical (look)
Seen blood, sweat and tears like a locker room
But you should take a look at where it got us to
We grind so when we shop out, we cop out, like precincts, even if it's not out
Bring your whole stock out
We ain't on the court but everything is gettin' boxed out
We got it on lock, you just locked out
Skinny jeans but a nigga's still hood
I bet they never thought they'd see a B.I.G. gone good
But I swear to God my bitch Bad Boy
And that's word to my nigga Bab boy
I saw Puff
I was finna speak
Nigga turned around and he recognize me
Damn
Now that's what the fuck you call dedication
Gettin' money? You still waitin' on your reparations
Weight of the world, I lived without preparation
And it's type to make a real nigga separation

[Chorus] [Mike Posner]
Just because you know me, you don't know me
I've been tryin' to do it big since '03
And I got a little big keepin' low key
Tryin' to keep up in my mind and you wonder why
Oh my mind
Don't wonder why
They're stayin' on my mind

[Verse Three] [Kenn Starr]
I used to be the most humble until
I figured out that it don't matter for real
Not one arrogant, ill as a blood born pathogen that can kill
The reason why they had to give me a deal
Cause I'm gettin' it in
Like this the joint that can get me the spins
You get the point? Listen, this what it is
Here's the lesson, I'm a force to be reckoned with
Why would you question it man?
The course is a definite
I'm raw as I ever been in
You soft and you delicate
You should have a flower logo
I power awesome like Austin Powers with his mojo
Cross the powers, all devoured in a heartbeat 
Sharper than Sharpies, I'm sharper than shark teeth
Start beef?
You could get it or your spouse
You'll be harder to find than diggin' in your couch lookin' for your car keys
Give her back with a sensitive mouth and some hard knees
From gettin' the jimmy like a car thief is
Wale and Kenn Starr, we
Outta ya league, we grand slam fans outta they seats
Let's get paper
And caked up like six layers of thick make up 
On a self conscious chick overcompensating for A cups

[Chorus] [Mike Posner]
Just because you know me, you don't know me
I've been tryin' to do it big since '03
And I got a little big keepin' low key
Tryin' to keep up in my mind and you wonder why
Oh my mind
Don't wonder why
They're stayin' on my mind

[Outro] [Mike Posner]
Ohhh, wait till I get back to campus
Everybody and they momma's gonna chant this
I'ma make a pretty bitch sandwich 
Haha, yeah</pre>
