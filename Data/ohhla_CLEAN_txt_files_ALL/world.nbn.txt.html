Intro:
Check it out. I heard this track right here and I kind of felt a lil'
somethin'. You know. It took my mind some place it ain't been.Search deep
into another world. So I'm trying to figure out what make this world go
round. For real. People are stressin'.

Treach:
Oh how oh how come everytime we have problems they nix none
Sending people to other plants when they still ain't fix this one
Victims from a distance prections of affliction
Some faction cause frictions fractions need fixinng
Mixing making music man to make it work
Some sticking shakin' bruisin' damn just ta brake a purse
It's worse misguided some guttered locked on the block
Cause the cops can't be trusted
Busted trusted frustrated frustrations of no more patience
Insides are cold and vacant check how we lay it
Why when we speak they try to stifle our breath 
Cock a rifle to chest 
Then ya have the party of your life at your death
Oh I wanna know I wanna know
Oh why, oh why is it the good that have to go
And they tell us that's just how this life goes
So I look at the kids and wonder where their life might go
Get high to tell ya low that's how its done on the bricks 
We all mad at the world when the world ain't done shit
Just the people in it and the scavengers who function
Who destroy the earth then blame the earth for its malfunctions
And getting maybe a tad bit too deep to follow
But the black form is strong and far from being hollow
Why do we get so much into this Freeing Willy
When Willy is already free
He and them ain't doing shit to free my city
And it's a pity for those who can't get the nitty gritty
That's when the gritty gets grimy and the wicked gets witty
So much pain on the brain can't restrain 
Place the comma too much drama but I'll bleed to please my momma
So I'm a strive to perfection leave pride in slum sections
Keep wit my crew and make all due connections

Hook:
But but but but but that's what makes the world go round
The axis like a carouse

Treach:
Oh how the ways? 
Nowadays baby's coming from spitting out momma's nipple
From the cradel to the killa leaving corspe and cripples
A Brooklyn boy dies shot by a cop for a play gun
Our kids days are up even if they ain't stray ones
You lay one or two on the more now the merrier the day's dumb
When crews war and now streets get scarier cops hit blocks saying we'll
beat 'em
Into freedom then we feel robbed like there's no God
When we need him
So we act accordingly cause we dont' see enjoyment 
The only line ofbusiness I'm offered is unemployment
So we gots to get ours and ours gotta get it
And it is what it be so see that I'm with this
Media haas us believin' they hype 
Don't pull out ya new shoes cause only the bad news is good news
Farrakahn wants us to take the streets back time to take it
Before our whole race is stripped naked

Hook
