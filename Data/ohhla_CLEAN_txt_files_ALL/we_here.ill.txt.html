[singing]
We here~! I said we here
Let's buckle up and enjoy this crazy year
It's clear (it's clear) the check is cleared
We poppin bottles like it's first day of the year
Get ready (get ready) get set goooooo
Punch the gas, hold the wheel and don't let gooo
We flyin (we flyin) flyin on our own
I'm in another country I will call you when I'm home

[Chorus]
Yeah, so this is for my people with (ice to rock)
(Ice to rock because it's nice to rock)
Yeah, and this is for my people with the (pricey watch)
(The pricey watch, cause it's nice to rock)
So throw your hands in the sky if you (livin the dream)
(Livin the dream, you know we're gettin this cream)
I stay fresh and the ladies call me (Mr. Clean)
(Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean)

[Illa J]
This is Mr. Clean, Mr. Listerine
Krispy Kreme "Donuts," go nuts, oh nuts - nuts
Don't rush, don't bust, gotta enjoy this
"Let's Go Crazy," you saw +Purple Rain+
I'm cold off the chain, gotta get a bodyguard
Get hoes off my chain, need to get away
Now we travellin off to Spain
Just checked my bank account, I can't complain
It's me, Stacy and Frank-N-Dank
Rollin through the gates of the illest old palace
Got crazy whips, got our soul balanced
The money is nothin, it's all about the journey
It's all about the challenge
I'm schoolin these wannabeez, put your mouth under these
Here's a nice teabag to clear your throat
I'm out here in Cali I don't need a coat
All I do is stay high and let my mind float

[Chorus]

[singing]
I'm so icy hot, hot, yeah yeahhhh
I got that pricey watch, watch, yeah yeahhhh
These crazy diamond rings, rings, yeah yeahhhh
I love the way they bing, bing, yeahhhh

[Illa J]

[Chorus]
