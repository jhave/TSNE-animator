[Intro]
I'm a boss

[Chorus]
I'm ridin through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars {*2X*}
I'm worth a million dollars
I been worth a million dollars {*3X*}
I'm ridin through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars {*2X*}
I'm makin women holla (holla) {*2X*}
Makin women holla (holla)

[Rick Ross]
I just left my momma house and it made me feel good
I just paid my momma bills, you would if you could
You see I'm from the ghetto where you gotta go to prison
Cause niggaz in the ghetto always end up in the system
But I'm ridin through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars (dollars)
I'm ridin through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars (dollars)
Convertible Impala, wouldn't drive what I'm ownin
Plus I'm ballin like them brothers smokin on that California
Hit the freeway! I'm the new nigga not my brother nigga
Got our lives in it {?}stalkin the whip{?} one of the toughest
Gotta handle my business, I came up with a plan
and my mind active, I'm in a lime green Lamb'
Yeah them hoes wanna ride with us
I love to drive on them two wheels, yo they love us
Got 'bout 20 stacks up in my jeans
Hit the interstate, we gettin sucked in between, you see

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
You gotta understand the feeling baby
It's like comin to the crap game, clearin 'em out
Nigga done came up, feel me?
Now I'm a billionaire, big boss
Let's say I'm comin down on some shit that I
I paid four hundred thousand for
I paid that with a smile~!
I'm comin down, mines be all I drive
It's all the way live
Boss about, boss, and I love to floss
It ain't even that deep
You gotta follow close
When I saw that PF Changs we can do some thangs
I'm a real nigga though
Ha~! We the Best, so fresh
I'm higher than a muh'fucka man
And I'm TRILLA! Trilla... Trilla...</pre>
