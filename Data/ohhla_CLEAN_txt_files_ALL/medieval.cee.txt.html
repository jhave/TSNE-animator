Well...
I'm a species so rare the human eye's hardly seen
A thin line between divine and killing machine
A dark side of the light that no one should ever see
Oh, I feel for the foolish for fucking with me
There is a war inside me but the water is still
You'll be safer every time assuming it will,
But to lose my composure I don't normally do,
I just thought that you should know
I've been sicker than you

You don't know me
A record can't tell ya
Uh-oh, I'm the Great Pretender
(repeat)

You say you want my pain,
My own personal pain
A lot hurt, heartache, and hard times it's hard to explain
I can feel the anger starting to happen again
I'd bust your head and break your brain for five minutes of fame
A-ha ha
My heart beats with unconditional love
But beware of the blackness that it's capable of
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
You got to travel the road of a troubled soul
I'm trying so hard not to lose control
Oh yeah, Oh yeah

You don't know me
A record can't tell ya
Uh-oh, I'm the Great Pretender
(repeat)

They said in life you shouldn't worry
Just got to let the wind blow
Ha, ha, ha
You see every day I'm struggling
For the strength to let it go
Ha, ha, ha

You don't know me
A record can't tell ya
Uh-oh, I'm the Great Pretender
