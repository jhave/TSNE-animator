[Drake]
Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm having a good time, they just trying to ruin it
shout out to the fact that I'm the yougest nigga doing it
cap on, brim bent, Denzel, Larry time (?)
she ain't trying to pop that sh-t for pimp okay well never mind
I I I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cards saying fuck ya life
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
and if you dolled up I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy getting rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double
famous like a drug that I've taken too much
I never ever trip
just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

[Chorus - Drake]
I'm about whatever man..
Fuck what they be talking about
They opinon doesn't count
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night..
whole crews in here
Cause I don't really know who I'mma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team. Man I love my team..
I would die for these niggas..

[Nicki Minaj]
Yo, Drizzy sayin' get her I'ma get her
I get the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?
that was just a keep sake
bought the president the louie presidential briefcase
never been a cheapskate
we got the Hawks I ain't talking about the Peach state
man for Petes sake scratch that, sweep stakes (hahahaha)
fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you like no
Im a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed
M M M6 from a M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu
but I collect 100 thou at the venue
pop bottles with my team, Young Money till the death of me

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Nicki and Drake talking]

[Nicki Minaj]
I mean we don't even rock them shoes if it ain't got a comma on the price tag
I mean, I mean but then again who looks at the price

[Drake]
Oh yeah we in this bitch
oww, oww, oww</pre>
