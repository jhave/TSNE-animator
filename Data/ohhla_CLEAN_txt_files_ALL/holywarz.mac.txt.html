[Intro: Timbo King]
Maccabeez, I don't care what beat it is
We stil gon' give you jewels
Jewels... hehe.. come on

[Timbo King]
I said the most important space is between your ears
It took, years, months and days to release this here
My black people, think, value and price is the same
We were shipped to America and given slave names
Like, John and Harry, crons we carry
I was born out of wedlock, my moms ain't married
Battery thug, run up in the courts with gats
Even the news reporter doubt it was a terrorist attack
Free Mumia and all of our political leaders
Since the, fall of Rome, we've been carrying heaters
Fuck, Julius Caesar and his whole empire
Maccabeez here now to set the game on fire, come on

[Chorus 3X: Killah Priest]
Ya'll don't really want war
We come like outlaws

[Hell Razah]
I've been dragged to the face of a judge, came up with thugs
Give thanks to the OG's who gave me they love
Maccabeez, hold our cups up high, and drink blood
Of the Sunz who be carrying guns, all through the flood
Like the red sea, empty clips, go 'head and tempt me
You be like Kennedy, shot, inside a Bentley
We slip in the AK clip, spill blood on your Nazi outfit
We come in the house shit, it's like Hitler
And Malcolm X, three five, magnum techs
The Pharaohs of the projects, nigga

[Chorus 3X]

[Killah Priest]
Me no like anything, oh me no, hammer ring
In my hood, triggers pull, niggas fall, kill 'em all
Fuck police, kill a Bush, caught Saddam, still a crook
Best to cop, free my block, squeeze that glock, he don' chopped
Drive away, we smoke haze, relocate, esses
SK, let's spray, wet back, nigga's back
Cool's gat, hood rat, fuck 'em all, grab my mack
Ridiculous gun, ridiculous clips
That's the, vehicular shit, predicted a hit
When I, draw my four, call for the lord
Handcuffed by God, brung through, heaven's doors
Thrown in, spiritual jail, locked the gates
Cuz when I'm, down on this Earth, try'nna cock my K
Try'nna bring on Armageddon, scream up on to wet 'em
Fuck 'em, just embalm 'em and dress 'em
When I'm the don in my pressure, rhyme to perfection
Leo Angel, muthafucka, Priest in his essence, come on

[Chorus 3X]</pre>
