Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Vado]
All I wanted was my time flooded
And to be one the next TIME cover
These niggas don't know the grind of it
Far as painting pictures, I let my mind brush it

[Verse 1: Vado]
You never know a man till you play cards with him
Could even show his hand if you play smart with him
Casino game in the park with him
Chess table, black label, sippin' dark with him
Surrounded by OG's and old fiends
High dub, like sittin' in the nose bleeds
In the half I move the whole thing
There's no thing make a sound on every phone ring
Get a little fame, they gon' hate
See you in a chain they gon' say your cross fake
Success is a due, you can pay it just cost fate
They say I need me a [?] the walls' draped

[Chorus: French Montana]
Look me in my eyes, I was built for this
Got a hundred guns on me, don't get killed for this
Niggas say they riding, you ain't riding on my will for this
If I die, hope the lord forgive this shit
Look me in my eyes, I'mma keep it 100
I see you fuckbois coming, look me in my eyes
[?], now you fuckbois running
Look me in my eyes

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Pull a Bentley to the block, ribbon on the hood
Just to let you niggas know who winning in the hood
Got the Benz, got the Rolls, the Acura Audi
12 mill on the floor, she vacuuming around it
I'm at that big money Pacquiao payout
Hit Puff for a mill on the way out
Me and Pharrell charter jets from the same boy
Swear to God I had the SK in the clearport
Double M, we're known to hit your ass up
Shooters jumping out of their mask like we Daft Punk
Fat Trel, Stalley, nigga (Rockie Fresh!)
We the best, real nigga, rally nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Vado]
No need to front, these hoes know me
I'm Kobe, I'm know for scoring a bunch
Having a bunch in the Plaza, top floor on the Trump
What you grabbed the whole year, I bagged more in a month
Hah, that's right I'm mad nice
Posted in front of corner stores like bag ice
I know your whore, she blow the horn like bagpipes
I'm in baby's shit, cleaned up like ass wipes
Bugatti parked, be Gotti sharp
Like the Tin Man, steel on me without a heart
Been with them soldiers, boy, before Collipark
Surrounded by sharks in the ocean with body parts

[Chorus]</pre>
