[Chorus]
Kandi girl (kandi girl)
You are my world (you are my world)
You look so sweet
You're a special treat
Kan-di girl
You are my world (my world)
You look so sweet
You're a special treat

[Lil' Briana]
Wow ta dow watch out now  
It's lil' Briana no I'm not Bow Wow
I'm that candy girl that lil' Miami girl
Sweet like cinnamon with the candy swirl  
I'm like sugar and spice
My flow so nice
Colorful ice like rainbow bright
I'm that candy girl sweet like a life savor
Got more flavors than a pack of Now or Laters
Ten years old the baby diva
The kids at school call me baby Trina
When I step on this track it make your fingers snap
And do the peanut butter jelly with the baseball bat

[Chorus]

[Trina]
I taste like candy a candy treat
So sweet from my head down to my feet
This song's dedicated to my candy girls
The life of luxury the candy world
With candy benz's marble floors
Cartier kisses and cash galore
With candy toys candy yacht's
Candy verses and candy four dots
No it don't stop and we on the rise
To slip and slide and diva enterprise
We drop candy hits that's how we bring it
I'm a candy girl come on Stef sing it

[Chorus]

[Lil' Briana]
I'm a candy girl and my flow too hot
Sweet like lollipops and gumdrops
Gummy bears Skittles and Kit Kats
I'm a young girl running this game you with that?
I got more flavors than Starburst
I keep my penny candy in my Prada purse
If I act too sassy pardon me y'all
I be playing with Barbie dolls in my carnegie hall
I'm a good good girl a candy girl
The baby Diva with the baby doll pearls
If you ain't come to party we ain't having that
So do the Donkey Kong and the cabbage patch

[Chorus]</pre>
