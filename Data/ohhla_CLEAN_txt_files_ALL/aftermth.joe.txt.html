[Intro - Sample from "Rocky Balboa"] (*echo*)
You ain't gonna believe this
But you used to fit right here
I'd hold you up, and say to your mother
"This kid's gonna be the best kid in the world
This kid's gonna be somebody better than anybody I ever knew"
And you grew up good and wonderful
It was great just watching you every day, it was like a privilage
Then the time come for you to be your own man
And take on the world, and you did
But somewhere along the line, you changed
You stopped being you

[Joe Budden - talking over the end of the Intro]
It's, it's, it's that On Top Music!

[Verse 1 - Joe Budden]
Look, look, look, shout to all my fans, glad I can inspire y'all
Got a couple haters, still tryin to acquire more
You're prayin to a higher power, hopin I should fall
But even my writer's block, ends in a firewall
Everybody acts reckless, judgin by they past efforts
If they ran shit, why it won't show up on they track records? (talk to 'em)
How could the critics ever hear me and say I'm a suffer?
How when they play with words and I make 'em play with each other?
Choppers over the booth, ready for prime time
Become one with his thoughts, intertwine with his mind
Go toe to toe, blow for blow or do it rhyme for rhyme
Be competitive coke heads and go line for line
Honestly that crap of yours, you should raffle off
With me they gettin Genius Bars without the Apple store
Under the microscope, I rebut' the scrutiny
If I'm to be compared, it's only to who I used to be
Take a closer look at rappers and you might discover
This faggot's talkin boxing, avoid the Mike Buffers
Now you the type to cuff her, me I get tired of her
See you the type get hyped to hug her but won't try to fuck her
Them pencil thin bitches, me that ain't the style he dates
Mine sit on the bed and leave an imprint of a smiley face
To introduce the newcomers to my habitat
The calm's before the storm, this the debris from the aftermath 
(aftermath)

[Break - Sample from "Rocky Balboa"]
Let me tell you something you already know
The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows
It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are
It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it
You, me or nobody, is gonna hit as hard as life
But it ain't about how hard ya hit
It's about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward

[Verse 2 - Joe Budden]
Check it, check, check it, let me change pace
The alternate route's a long one but you'll ultimately end up in the same place
So I tell aspiring artists "think beyond greater"
I know some niggaz with platinum plaques and bronze paper
But better livin should be earned, never fed or givin
So I traded my recognition instead for a vision
They always told me that I'd end up dead or in prison
Who ever thought that same dude gettin head while he whippin
That the chicks would hang up on? Give 'em the dial tone
Now buyin wild homes, straight cash without loans
I always managed to do better when there's doubt shown
I'll teach you how to turn them diamonds into milestones
Class is in session and look who's come to tutor
They passin the fake off as real like Brian Pumper's jeweler
Where I'm from niggaz with fear gettin slumped by shooters
But my equal to dumpin Rugers is done by computers
I'm gettin bread, every verse like the lotto
Give 'em substance but they treat every word like it's a hollow (blaat)
My niggaz off parole, I'm tryin to give 'em somethin pure to follow
'Cause he ain't have a pot to piss in, just a urine bottle
I come from where so many people were raised with neglect
Cops tryin to meet they quota, thirsty to make an arrest
All my wrongdoings did, was put my faith to a test
Which made me much stronger, guess my mistakes were correct (oh!)

Ta ha
Ta ha (ta ha)!

[Outro - Sample from "Rocky Balboa"]
Now if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth
But ya gotta be willing to take the hit
Not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of 
him, or her, or anybody!
Cowards do that and that ain't you!
You're better than that!</pre>
