Serious motherfucker balls, spit my dime, fuck the sidewalk man

Watch them die over the drug and the white bitch man, the white bandit 
Watch them die over the Cocaine (*CHOKE*) faces of death man 
In the ghetto, projects what ever you want to call it 
We all the same man, we all in the same shit (S-P-I-C-E) word-a 
We say the 187, the 187 (jealousy got me strapped) callin the murder 
The 187, the 187 is in the fire (nigga)

The 187, the 187, the 187 
The 187, the 187, the 187, the BLOAW! 

(Spice 1) 
Murder from the mind of a sick nigga 
Thinkin bodies, dirty money, bloody Cocaine and Tech clips 
I play with pistol grips, dead niggas and lolly tips 
Suicidal sick shit, a psychopathic lunatic 
Caught up in murder man, dirty up in this dead fool 
Faces of Death, hog my dreams out of drains fools 
Pullin pistols, tellin niggas to get the fuck back 
I'm regulatin shit, there's money up on my dope track 
See I'm a soldier in this game, ain't nothin strange 
Got a nigga lyin on the floor with half of his fuckin brains 
Murder and crazy it's just a part of the game 
Niggas won't kill ya, just don't fuck with their Caine 
Mack 10 silencer all ya heard was screams (AHHHHHH!!!) 
All I seen was the gleams from the Infra-Red beams 
Another motherfuckin walk-by in your hood 
Better pack two clips up on your hips and it's all good 
That nigga Death, he got more faces than a motherfucker 
So don't be shocked if you're naked, bleedin in your gutter, niggas 

Ay bwoy, ay this is... in this mother... 

Faces of Death is an way gone past 
Fuck up all of your hoes, all up in your bed, in your bed 
Faces of Death is an way gone... 
Fuck all of your hoes, all in your bed, this is... in your bed, in this... 
Faces of Death away, fuck up all your hoes all in your bed, in your bed 
Faces of Death is an way gone... (all right) 
Fuck up all your hoes in your bed (Twilight Zone to 1999 yet, Spice 1) 
Don't you ever... in your bed
East Bay Gangsta, gangsta hoe, ooh (well all right, can you hang?) 

Can you motherfuckers hang, I mean slang them thangs as they go? 
Well, all right, hoe, hoe, hoe, well I'm wrong 
Say no, sing a sad song ohh, cause a, 
cause a hoe's are gon' lay on, we all gon' hash one day 
Well all right on, uh sayer, sprayer, East Bay, well on Willie 
Mother pimp in the game, 187 faculty thang hey, well all right
