Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You're a street nigga
Cook that dope up
You're a water whipper
Cook that dope up
You make an easy million
Cooking that dope up
Every project buildings
Cooking dope up

Every project I go in
These niggas cooking dope up
It's free dope Friday and I'm giving Jay's wake-up
The line at the spot the shoot straight up in the shape up
Early mornin' workin' me and juice cookin bricks up
I'd like to broke my wrist trying to cook a beans trunk
VVS diamonds all my wrist got me ice stunt
This nigga hit my jug phone, he wanna brick cooked up
Just give me 6 zips, bro, and I'll whip the rest up

Stretch the pot,nigga
Stretch that dope, boy
You can't cook, nigga
What you sell dope for?
You're a steet nigga
Cook that dope up
You're a water whipper
Cook that dope up
You make an easy million
Cooking dope up
Every project building
Cooking dope up

Scurr... scurr... scrap the sides
Scurr... scurr... cookin pie
I'ma tell no lies
Most of niggas small fry
I'd done sold more chicken then Churches and Popeye
Million dollar trap not only in my eye
Pull up on the block, tall rims with some dean ?
Pluged in with Freddy but young Jue man got them mall ties
Smoking up the gas take a look in to my eye
Got the trap hotter than a Motherfuckin wildfire
Straight drop gag... got the hood n the pile drive
Remix on a fish,let me hit it with a screwdriver
Jug,jug,jug keep tryin' to make my money back
First forty ate a brick, left it up on cold file

You're a street nigga
Cook that dope up
You're a water whipper
Cook that dope up
You make an easy million
Cook that dope up
Every project building
Cooking dope up</pre>
