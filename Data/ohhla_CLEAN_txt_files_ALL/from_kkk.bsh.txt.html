Song:   Letter From KKK
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

[ VERSE 1 ]
I got a letter from the muthafuckin Ku Klux Klan, man
They say they wanna give us a helping hand
With pulling that goddamn trigger
And killin off 4'000 other niggers
Since 1975
Yeah, that's how many of us died
And these peckerwoods ain't frontin
Cause they know that we're killin each other over nothin
Steady givin em the power
Cause we're fightin each other over streets that ain't even ours
Cause we wanna be slingers
And oh yeah, congratulations to all you gangbangers
Cause everytime you pop one
Might be killin a future black lawyer or doctor, son
Or a future black businessman
That the white man has to compete with in the end
We're havin fun with the gun
Wipin out our next black generation to come
Cause we don't listen
And that's why niggas get the most time in prison
Cause they judge is on their payroll
And day by day steady gainin mo' control
They got us up against the ropes
A letter from the Ku Klux Klan to us black folks

[ CHORUS 1 ]
Will a East Coast brother ever go for that shit?
(Hell no, the muthafuckas gotta go)
Will a West Coast brother ever go for that shit?
(Hell no, the muthafuckas gotta go)
Would a brother up north ever go for that shit?
(Hell no, the muthafuckas gotta go)
Would a brother down south ever go for that shit?
(Hell no, the muthafuckas gotta go)

[ VERSE 2 ]
They're claimin that they're winnin
And pretty soon they'll go back to rapin our women
Cause they'll be at home alone
Cause they figure all us niggas'd be gone
So gangbangers, keep up the good work, guys
Cause they love to read about the drive-by's
How we kill our family and friends
They love to hear how many niggers died over the weekend
Because they don't need us
But for now they can tolerate these niggers with jungle fever
And it's a disgrace
Cause they're helpin them further break down the black race
Till we can't fight
And if they keep it up, all of our black kids'll be white
And we can ?wait for it or dispise?
Because we're too blind to open our damn eyes
And all our dreams go up in smoke
A letter from the KKK to us black folks

[ CHORUS 2 ]
Will a 5th Ward brother ever go for that shit?
(Hell no, the muthafuckas gotta go)
Would a South Park brother ever go for that shit?
(Hell no, the muthafuckas gotta go)
Will a Northside brother ever go for that shit?
(Hell no, the muthafuckas gotta go)
Would a Southside brother ever go for that shit?
(Hell no, the muthafuckas gotta go)

[ VERSE 3 ]
And all you gangbangers they say they don't love ya
But they can appreciate they way that you slaughter
Other muthafuckas in the street
Killin up a different gang of niggas every muthafuckin week
Makin the graveyards bigger
You're doin a wonderful job eliminatin us niggas
Without our men our women can't reproduce
Unless of course we let the white man shoot his juice
And then it'll be over, brother
Thanks to our helping commitment to kill each other
And we can't go out like that
So we gotta reload that gat
And hunt down that white ghost
And get to ?waste? their muthafuckin ass from coast to coast
Cause I'm a fool on the trigger, I like to pull it
I'm sendin that muthafuckin letter back with a bullet
Bang-bang, there you have it
Now I'm just waitin for you prejudiced muthafuckas to grab it
So you can see what I'm talkin about
Then you can see which goddamn race gets wiped out
Cause Bushwick's fed up with you hoes
And you can keep your fuckin letter

[ CHORUS 3 ]
Will Malcolm X ever go for that shit?
(Hell no, the muthafuckas gotta go)
Would Martin Luther King ever go for that shit?
(Hell no, the muthafuckas gotta go)
Would Farrakhan ever go for that shit?
(Hell no, the muthafuckas gotta go)
Would Mandela ever go for that shit?
(Hell no, the muthafuckas gotta go)</pre>
