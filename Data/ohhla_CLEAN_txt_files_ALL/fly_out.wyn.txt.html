HEY! HaHa.Yea

[Verse 1]
I got the game on ball and chain
I threw the key in the train
I'm like the key in the truck
I spent a G on these frames, though my vision is priceless
Seeing through you niggaz like a fuckin psychic
Hearing through the grapevine, niggaz wanna hate mine
Say my name and die in the daytime
You catch my drift, man you better be Peyton
Boy the heats on, they make a peace bond
I'm in this bitch, throwing up the seventeenth sign
Straight frowns, no daps, strapped three times
A Tec-11, AK 47, one Beretta, ready for whatever
Tell them pussy niggaz come together
Heavy wetter, nigga super soaker wetter, nigga
Six feet under flowers, you ain't nothing but a petal nigga
I'm just a little nigga, trying to be a civil nigga
Thirty years old, shit that'll be a different nigga
Quit it Wayne, your Mom is listenin
But she ain't really trippin, 'cause the pots is piston
Them niggaz trippin, unitl the shots whistling'
Hear them bullets sizzle, like a cobra at attention
I gotta bitch, and quit callin women bitches
As long as she don't worry 'bout the coke in the kitchen
No preventing the crime, I gotta get it
I'm admitted to the game, true playa, no quittin
There you go shittin on a way a nigga thinkin
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin
This is the future and crime is to no one
I live everyday like this is the sure one
Train in the tidal wave, this is the ocean
Stand in the heat, 'til the mother fuckin snow come
And it feels so fuckin good
Throw my dope like a rope, let them tug and pull
No hope for the hopeless, rats and roaches
Runnin cross the porch, in the attic there's a fortune
Come and get it, automatics in motion
We bangin for the bread nigga, even the molded
I got my loaf, I got my toast
Chaperone of the south, I got my coast. Yea
And unll I die I'm Da. Da Da Da Da. Da BEST RAPPER ALIVE</pre>
