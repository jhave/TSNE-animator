Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[CHORUS]
I'm no stranger to shame
I've got little to blame
You sent for me and so I came
I'll come runnin' when you call my name
Cuz I'm no stranger, I'm no stranger to shame
I said I'm no stranger, I'm no stranger to shame

I might stagger and I might sway
I might stutter just a bit but that's ok
I'm not walkin' too good that's true
I got a broke ass limp that'll pull me though
I might appear to be a pile of rags
But I'm a stack of hundreds in a paper bag
I've been around this world and back
I made a million bucks and put it all on black

So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away
It's not the first time, not the last
You can leave me where I lay, because
So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away
It's not the first time, not the last
You can leave me where I lay, because

[REPEAT CHORUS]

I've been known to wake up in some dirty places
The sun only shines on deserving faces
The mind erases, forgets the stars
See each and every city has corner bar
That's where I am in a world so grim
The lights are as bright as the day is dim
See I'm priceless in a class of my own
I used to stay out late but now I don't go home

So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away
It's not the first time, not the last
You can leave me where I lay, because

How do you feel when the birds are chirpin'
When your in bed and everybody is workin'
Are you down with the non believers
Make the slackers look like over achievers
The dogs scratchin' on the door again
The cat's out but he don't wanna come in
You got a bed and you got a floor
But the couch is closer to your front door

So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away
It's not the first time, not the last
You can leave me where I lay, because

[REPEAT CHORUS]</pre>
