[Intro: The Dream] (LL Cool J)
LL!!!! (LL!!!) I see you J!!! The American Dream!!!!
Radio killer!!!!! Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
Yeah! (Yo I don't think they can handle this one man)
Alright alright alright, call the radio and tell them it's your song
It's your song, it's your song, it's your song, it's your song
(Sing it with me baby! Dream! Uh!)
Girl come on, girl come on, girl come on (Shorty I'm your)

[Chorus: The Dream] (* LL Cool J &amp; The Dream on adlibs)

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
Met this lil' girl she was off the hook
I got cold chills when her body shook
Hot Sex on the platter, no need to cook
I let her steal my heart like a horny crook 
Had her grindin and windin against my leg 
She messin with my head, wanna play in the bed 
Sexy pumps on, toenails red 
Your body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead 
It hard to hold you when you movin vulgar 
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta 
My Pulp ain't Fiction, it's an addiction 
to see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen 
Nasty girl, taught me all the lingo 
While mama play bingo, she ride mandingo 
She don't give a damn if I'm married or single 
She makes me TINGLE! Shorty I'm your.....

[Chorus: The Dream] (* LL Cool J &amp; The Dream on adlibs)
Cause I'm your baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby
I'm your baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby
I'm your baby (*HEY!!!) Your baby (*HEY!!!)
Your baby (*HEY!!!) Your baby ( *HEY!!!)
I'm your baby, your baby, yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
She likes Hip-Hop and R&amp;B 
Her lifetime goal is to be on TV 
She lookin for a man that could give her a break 
Like Usher or Justin Timberlake 
I'm really not sure if her breasts are fake 
Cause with whipped cream on 'em, they taste just like cake 
We drink some beer inside of daddy's '64 
She shot me in the back with cupid's arrow
We finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back
Pulled up her dress and she let me peep that
Im Drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty
Truck stop bathroom at 7:30
Bought her some dessert, give a damn if it's early
Head spinnin around like roller derby
Everything about her says you dont deserve me
I hope im worthy, cause shorty I'm your...........

[Chorus: The Dream] (* LL Cool J &amp; The Dream on adlibs)
Cause I'm your baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby
I'm your baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby
I'm your baby (*HEY!!!) Your baby (*HEY!!!)
Your baby (*HEY!!!) Your baby ( *HEY!!!)
I'm your baby, your baby, yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!

[Bridge: The Dream]
You need somethin like me? (Yeah!)
Cause he ain't nothin like me (No!)
You can search but you never 'gon find (No!
A love that's quite like mine (No!)
Need a man that can love you good
And treat you like he should
With me shorty you the shit
He might be good but he aint like this
Cause im your baby

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
In the back of the pickup clothin ripped up
She see my chrome wheels, it gets more real
Runnin and laughin, music blastin
Side over the road bent over crashing
Mouth all dry, I can feel the urge
If you see my mama, dont say a word
The cops wanna know why my words are slurred
Dont ask me officer ask hurr
Wanna another drink baby she like surr
Wanna hit the club she like I dont curr
She all in the rearview doin her hurr
Hairspray and lip gloss everywhurr
This all happens on an average day
Your life is a trip girl i'm here to stay
Never had a girl make me feel this way
Even though I had to pay, shorty I'm your....

[Chorus: The Dream] (* LL Cool J &amp; The Dream on adlibs)
Cause I'm your baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby
I'm your baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby
I'm your baby (*HEY!!!) Your baby (*HEY!!!)
Your baby (*HEY!!!) Your baby ( *HEY!!!)
I'm your baby, your baby, yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!</pre>
