Song:   Back Up
Typed by: Cr8tivemindz@aol.com

(Chorus)
Haters in the club (back up)
Gold Diggers (back up)
Broke niggaz (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

(Verse 1)
I'm in the cut in the club
Scopin the scene
Cup half way full
Smokin the green
She got her hand on my nuts
What does that mean?
Pointed at her freind
And she said, they'll tag team
Now who said dreams dont come true
Its like I'm dreamin
When I come through
I always find something to run through
Speak into the mike mami
Mic check one two
Drunk in the club
Off the chain
But who gives as fuck?
That's why I came
So pour it up
And get down
Ya'll have no choice
But to listen to Pit now

(Chorus)
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It dont involve money then (back up)
Dawg, get from me and (back up)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggaz (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

(Verse 2)
Everybody knows
Pit's got tight raps
When I'm in the club
DJs bring it back
With no questions asked
But the number one question is
"Does he got cash?"
Lil Jon's at the bar
While me and them eastside boys smoke out
Roll another one
No doubt
Get a couple hoes
Roll out
Beef, you dont want none
To go down
Dum diddy dum dum
My times now
The city Im from
Is covered with federals
That'll make your crew run run
Your crew run run
Its next to come

(Chorus)
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It dont involve money then (back up)
Dawg, get from me and (back up)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggaz (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

(Verse 3)
I convince mami to creep on the DL
Even though my head spinning
Like some sprewells
Skip the details
Its the vodka bottom line
Thats testin my patience like doctors
I'm not impressed by the cool shit
Or those chains or that ice or them cars
All thats bullshit
If thats what your lookin for
Keep lookin hoe
Cause you got the wrong one bitch
I'll let you know
Mami's like damn
That Cuban's shot out
Bitch I came to the club
To wild out
If you came to act up
Then you need to get from me bitch
And back up

(Chorus)
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It dont involve money then (back up)
Dawg, get from me and (back up)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It dont involve money then (back up)
Dawg, get from me and (back up)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggaz (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggaz (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)</pre>
