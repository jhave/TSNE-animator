[Blaze]
Look into my mind, tell me what you see, what you find
Can somebody tell me what's happening this time?
I don't know
I break it down again, losing control
With these demons inside still pulling at my soul
Still reaching for my coat, I choke and black out
Without a lung to pump anymore oxygen out
Am I doomed on the Earth with these ??? symptoms
Cause your church won't grant the dead an exorcism

[Violent J]
Let me get two turntables and a microphone
Black rain, bloody murder means spike your dome
Why, I, don't know why
Pressure released from my head when you die
(Ali Baba)
Empty pill bottles on the shelf
Got this hunger and a sexual drive to end your health
Fucking aches (ouch)
You gotta die, I'm sorry but you gotta die

[Chorus]
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump off, damn
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again

[Madrox]
Fall in through emotion and passing through memories
Descending into dark with my hands in front of me
Waving and screaming, falling like a way through Hell
What's at the bottom? I don't know
But I'll find out when I get there
Hands grabbing at me, but I'm dodging them all
Slicing each and every wrist with my hatchet as I fall
And if I reach the bottom with my life intact
I'm a climb right to the top and go right back and do it again

[Monoxide]
If you can see what I was thinking then no one would have to die
It would be as simple as looking inside of my mind
And through time all the pressure has come to a head
And I release it on the innocent and leave 'em for dead
Could be a chemical imbalance where I blame it on this challenege
And remarks, so I waited in the dark where his car was parked
A couple whacks with the axe to his back
And he was down, and then I hit the ground
Somebody catch me

[Chorus]
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump off, damn
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again

[Shaggy]
If you listen too close you might lose your mind
If you look too close your head could explode like mind bomb (boom)
Did Blaze really get shot the fuck down? (Still bleeding)
Did Twiztid really sell they soul to the underground? (What?)
After the 6th, will ICP kill theyself? (fuck off)
Is ABK a real warrior or something else?
I don't know and I don't care
Just remember me with my fucking Lotus in the air (Lotus)

[ABK]
Keep talking mother fucker, do it again, don't push me
You fuckin with a old school cat that ain't friendly
So take it to that level, go ahead keep pulling my chain
Cause when I get upset I get strange
You have no clue
Check this out, I be fiending from mood swings
Ready to throw down and knock the shit out of soft range
Hard list, ready to live out whatever
So if you're in my path, we better best be walking together
(Mother fucker)

[Chorus]
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump off, damn
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again..</pre>
