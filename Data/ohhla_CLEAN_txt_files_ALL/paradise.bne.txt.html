Life, life, life, life
(What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do, what ya gonna do?)
Or death, death, death, death Life, life, life, life
(When murda, murda comez foe you, murda comez foe you)
(murda comez foe you?) Or death, death, death, death?
(Leave me alone) Ringaling, ah ling, me alone
Ringaling, ah ling me alone
(Leave me alone) Ringaling, ah ling, me alone
Ringaling, ah ling me alone
(Leave me alone) Feel tha thunder in tha sky
We party overtime No more Evil Paradise We party overtime(x2)

[Krayzie]

And this will belong in time, can ya feel tha painz of our life
been in wined, and ya thought of dyin', my my my
Have ya thought of dyin'? Let's not visualize
If you feel me! Then ya betta wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
If you feel me! Then ya betta get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Can you visualize your own pain, could ya imagine
breathin' yo' last breath, I bet ya, ya can't you don't wanna stay
Dear Lord, cannot stand, goin' to hell. It's comin', yes it's comin
No look what we've done, what have we done?
Amongst our sin, why here, we follow people for starez, don't stare
No mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy
Evil is lurkin', lurkin', lurkin
We can run but can't escape tha beast, no
Tickin' by that snake in tha grass, that snake in tha grass
by that snake in tha grass. Better sticked, and missed his ass 

[Layzie]

Fast blast, I leave my cash
Cause my dayz of livin' broke is all in tha past
So I gotta keep my mind up on my money, it's survival of tha fittest
could I. One of tha realest are ya dayz of drug dealin
Like in '89, now it's almost 1999, new Millennium
Fuck the luck, cause they be gettin em
Sendin' demonz str8 to hell, let them burn in Hades
Worried enough, we called in jail, Lord bless our babies
Lord pleaze bless our babies

(Wish): Who it be, givin you that new shit ya love?
Who it be, givin' you that new shit ya never heard of
Clap yo' handz foe Bone everybody, clap yo' handz foe Bone everybody
St. Clair we speak, we speak, wishing wishing...
we're takin' over, over
Betta run with this shit, with this shit
Or get road over, road over
So we, puttin' it down for me
Anybody wants to get, my mama trust the army, we deadly
(Leave me alone) Ringaling, ah ling, me alone
Ringaling, ah ling, me alone
(Leave me alone) Ringaling, ah ling, me alone
Ringaling, ah ling, me alone
(Leave me alone) Feel tha thunder in tha sky
We party overtime No more Evil Paradise We party overtime(x2)
Life, life, life, life (What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do)
(what ya gonna do?) Or death, death, death, death?
Life, life, life, life (When murda, murda comez foe you)
(murda comez foe you, murda come foe you?)
Or death, death, death, death? (Leave me alone)
Ringaling, ah ling, me alone. Ringaling, ah ling, me alone

(Leave me alone) Ringaling, ah ling, me alone
Ringaling, ah ling, me alone. (Leave me alone)
Feel tha thunder in tha sky We party overtime
No more Evil Paradise We party overtime(x2) </pre>
