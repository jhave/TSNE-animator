[Background: A Milli, A Milli, A Milli]
Young Money!!!!!
PD, yea, Mack I'm Gonna

[Verse 1]
A millionaire
I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a veneareal disease, like a menstrual I bleed
Threw the pencil and leak on the sheet of the tablet of my mind 
Cuz I don't write shit cuz I ain't got time
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of the ch ch ch ch chopper
Sister, Brother, Son, Daughter, Father Motherfuck a copper
Got the mazzerati dancin on the bridge pussy poppin
Tell the coppers hahahaha you can't catch him you can't stop him
I go by them goon rules if you can't beat em then you pop em
You can't man em then you mop em
You can't stand em then you drop em
You drop em cuz we pop em like Orville Redenbacher
I'm ill!!!!!

[Verse 2]
A million here a million there
Sicilian bitch wit long hair with coke in her derierre
Like smoke in the thinnest air I open that Lambourgini
Hopin them crackers see me like look at that bastard Weezy
He's a beast he's a dog he's muthafuckin problem
Ok you're a goon but what's a goon to a goblin
Nothin nothin you ain't scarin nothin
On some faggot bullshit call him Dennis Rodman
Call what you want bitch call me on my Sidekick
I won't answer if it's private damn I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch?
Yea I ate a shy bitch an she ain't shy no more
She ain't shy no more she changed her name to my bitch
Yea nigga that's my bitch
So when she ask for the money when you through don't be surprised bitch
An I ain't trickin if you got it
But you like a bitch wit no ass you ain't got shit
Muthafucka I'm ill not sick
An I'm ok but my watch sick
Yea my drop sick
An my glock sick
An my knot thick
I'm it
Muthafucka I'm ill

[Verse 3]
They say I'm rappin like BIG, Jay an Tupac
Andre 3000 where is Erykah Badu at
Who dat
Who dat said they gon beat Lil Wayne
My name ain't BIC but I keep that flame mane
Who dat wanna do dat boy you knew that chew that swallow
An I be the shit now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
An I'd rather be pushin flowers than to be in the pen sharin showers
Tony told us this world was ours
An the Bible told us baby girl was sour
Don't play in the garden an don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowry
Even Gwen Stefani say she couldn't doubt me
Muthafucka I say life ain't shit without me
Chrome lips pokin out the coupe look like it's poutin
I do what I do an you do wat you can do about it
Bitch I can turn a crack rock into a mountain
Dare me
Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me I'm illi
