Artist: Brand Nubian f/ Positive K
Album:  One For All
Song:   Grand Puba, Positive and L.G.
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Grand Puba] Two times for the drummer, 'fore I start it I say, "Hit me!"
             Puba's kickin flavor, and I brought somebody with me
[Positive K] Positive, the gentlemen, the rapper
             Suave blase, you know dapper
[Grand Puba] See this is not a song about friends
             because we make ends, and then we spread the skins
[Positive K] This song becomes a well known tune
             And my mic's gonna bloom like a flower in June
[Grand Puba] We kick much flavor and you know that
             As smooth as the head on a Fed named Kojak
[Positive K] Grip the mic til my hand get calloused
             And I'll tell you like Ralph Kramden told Alice,
             "Bang zoom!"
[Grand Puba] It's up up and away
[Positive K] Grand Puba
[Grand Puba] and Positive K
[Positive K] Lyrics real sweet like candy
[Grand Puba] It's just like a condom
[Pos &amp; Puba] WE KEEP ONE HANDY

Go Puba, go Positive (4X)

[Positive K]
To my adversaries, I'm not ordinary
Not the Godfather, or the Tooth Fairy
Not Jack Spade or Engelbert Humperdink
Listen to this rhyme and tell us what you think

[Grand Puba]
One two three Grand Puba's on the count
Rhyming gets me papes in very large amount
Brother you're wrong, if you think crime pays
Don't like gays, and take vacations off of holidays

[Positive K]
Practice safe sex to prevent strange diseases
Wear my hat, on one night skeezers
I roll dice, but don't bet on the horses
Punks take losses and I don't reveal my sources

[Grand Puba]
So umm, take the fifth if you're planning to riff
The rhymes spread like Jif to make your loose knot stiff
Kick up your feet if you're feeling kinda queasy..
Relax.. (ha ha) take it easy!

[Positive K]
You're in good hands, Positive is a survivor
I make rhymes of anything, I'm like McGyver
If I were a computer rap would be my program
Since I'm a righteous man, I don't eat ham
I wish more people was alive like me

[Grand Puba] But Positive..
[Positive K] Whattup Max?

[Grand Puba]
See the vocab is lovely, girls be thinkin of me
Other rappers try to be me, competition can't see me
so hey, whaddya say, I got the flow y'all
If you don't know the time then you better check the Seiko
or Timex, I suplex, get biz on the co-ssacks
Put em in a line then I ask, "Who's next?"
Grand Puba, guaranteed to make a big hit
Doin much damage on this two man skit
Trying to hold me back won't harm me
And when the gear gets too small it's for the Salvation Army
So mami, or mida, a way I say, "No one's sweeter!"
(Now that's funky!)
You see the style I kick is rugged, I shine like a nugget
Present tense means you dig it, past tense mean you dug it!
So dance, to a light tune, my lit-tle doll
Da-nah-nah, da-nah-nah, da-nah-nah, dah
Rock me wit, vi-bra-tion
Give me a deep med-i-ta-tion
there is none betta than Grand Pu-ba
Baby be get it all togetha
You see the second time around I hope the label don't flake
And if they do I go to Drake and say, "Give me a break"
Like Toyota say, I say (Oh what a feeling!)
I bust the foots of Lionel Richie
I caught him dancing on MY ceiling!

[Positive K]
Pass me the mic, cause I wants to blitz
I'm the best thing that came since grits
The Prince of Rap, lookin for Cinderella
If you see her.. why don't you tell her
I got the shoe, in the car out back
And if she makes the fit, she's IN, LIKE, THAT
and as a matter of fact
I'm not an actor, but the main factor
Pinpoint and his rhymes is like a protractor
I'm intricated, complicated
Definitely musically related
Rhymes so fly never been outdated
Gots to be fly by the way I state it
Now of myself, I say I'm a big fan
Got more rhymes, than words by the Letterman
Positive K, you can say he's low key
You might know my name but now look you don't know me
I can be nice and flip like the Son of Sam
Nobody knows exactly how I am
I'm the next and everybody knows it
Open tours this year, next year I'ma close it
I've got the skills that pays the bills, now
here's a quote from Stephanie Mills
Don't put a rush on me cause my tempo's slow
And if I don't tell you, then how would you know?</pre>
