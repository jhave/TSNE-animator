[Slick Rick]
Back in the day, we slow kiss
And man, I did search for an interior motive
Cuz all your look is sound hype
I wanna see if your worthwhile, settlin down type
God knows there's bigger
So, absorb to see if you gon sweat the next nigga
Oh help me make green light furriers
You know in life you can't race around with no worthless
So continue the sequel
You weighed in the scale and we lived as free people
Then disagree and erupted too
I don't feel my standards are being lived up to
So erection conquers, I ran out, went and had sex in Yonkers
God knows that flakin, jerkin her and not the replace
Great is lookin for

[Chorus]
I thought you said you loved me, didn't he? (lay hey hey)
I thought you said forever, to decease (lay hey hey)
I swore you were dishonest, do you believe (lay hey hey)
I'll search this world forever, are you real? (lay hey hey)

[Slick Rick]
Low is my time of honor, friend material and not that type of barner
So myself out of chump
Would the problems with having worth that type of jump
Commitment, rig, act cruddy, and regardless, move made and back studyin
Still screamin, thrown and elegance
Grown, don't play, growned intelligence
Fix what bother, and another
If speed's on made, once again, who gonna suffer? Stubborn fools came
The mule came over here wit a girl from the old school name
Though hit and all though back's about wit, memories
And that's about it, Cuz

[Chorus]

[Slick Rick]
And uneasiness kept here, even after we made this big giant step here
Womanhood, somewhere in the basement
Slowin down again, so I'm lookin 'a replacement
Music poundin a slow jam
Wit a girl knowin and down wit the program
Although the honey aim style king
Wit a took broom and taimin the wild thing
Loud, uneasiness brought out
Still tried to shove my tongue down the bushy broad mouth
Speedin, chasin after vaccine
Tried to string along, but I didn't have the patience
Learned from cussin and confusion
Breakin Commandments wasn't a solution
Though a few minor clicks in relationship
Still time to fix things

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
