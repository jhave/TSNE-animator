DPGC, You know what I'm throwin' up

[Daz Dillinger]
Yeaaa!
Y'all niggaz know what time it is, yeah
You know we about to get stupid in this motherfucker!
Yeah, all my motherfuckin' gangsta's put your motherfuckin' hands in the air

Who's the nigga that you love to hate?
Don't debate, bust you - dead in your face
Hold up! Wait a minute as I get down and dirty with it
Smokin' my spinach, Dat Nigga Daz is a menace
And I'm finna get gangsta with it
I'm outta the cut with some shit that I wrote
With my Dogghouse niggaz, so you know I must be dope but I..
Rat-tat-tat-tat that ass
What the fuck, Dat Nigga Daz won't stop
Til' I get the cash
I mash for the cars, and I'll bash your jaw
Blue and grey khakis with the All-Star's
Ten years of this gangsta shit
Bumpin' your system front and back and you know that it's crip
One nigga left the crew, somethin' we grew
To my monumental niggaz that draped in all blue
Greyed out, with the white trim Nike's
With my first cousin Bigg Snoop Dogg right behind me
Wanna die? Try me
With them AK twins drop like siamese
Get down to grindin', yo nigga, fuck signs

[Snoop Dogg]
Suge Knight is a fat bitch! HA HA

[Daz Dillinger]
I be the nigga with an all gat tucked in my drawers
Why nigga? Cause I'm down by law
D-O-double-G P-O-U-N-D, G-A-N-G-S-T-A C-R-I-P
Tell me what time it is cuh, ???? ???
Showin' y'all ???? niggaz there's no love
I thug it up, I slug it up, I tug it up
I DPGC nigga, you know what I'm throwin' uuuuup!

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
DPGC nigga, you know what I'm throwin' uuuuup!
Yeah, and you know we gonna keep it gangsta up in this motherfucker
Shit, I see my nigga Goldie Loc, what's up cuh!

[Goldie Loc]
Still ridin', Eastsidin'
Hittin' switches, slappin' bitches, makin' my riches
Cold crippin', stay dippin', still rippin'
Dippin' my cigarettes, fool I'm still trippin'
Kick on back and ease your cool
Cause everybody know that Daz and Goldie actin' fool
Snoop in the Cadillac, rollin' up the whole sack
I'm sitting in this motherfucker, holdin' on this mini-mack
So say it ain't gangsta..
You one of them Rollin' 21 five boys, nigga ain't ya?
You got that right, now back your ass up here come them Criptonites
I'm from the land of notorious gangstas (Long Beach!)
With a big "Eastside" always crip hard and stay anxious
Spittin' the heat, movin' the street

[Daz Dillinger]
Goldie Loc and D-A-Z, motherfucker!

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
DPGC nigga, you know what I'm throwin' uuuuup!
Yeah, Dat Nigga Daz is most definately in the motherfuckin' house
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about, HA HA

[Daz Dillinger]
I can't quit givin' you niggaz the blues
Double barrell shotty knockin' them niggaz right out their shoes
Solo's and crews
I...cock the tool and rebuild the nigga whole frame and burnin' this fuse
I wasn't born to lose
I know your mind, your heart, your soul ain't what it seems to be
When the cannon explode you and your boys is history
I told the story of a lifetime, came back with the right rhyme
2003 yeah it's all mine
So bow down and recognize to a boss
I made the shit up nigga, so how you talk
You better walk the walk before your ass get chalked
See I stalk the street nigga day and dark
I spark the flame, I'll leave you niggaz all ashamed
With The Gang motherfucker we blast and maintain
You on the wrong side of the set, motherfucker roll it up
DPGC nigga, you know what I'm throwin' uuuuup!


Yeah! HA HA, you know what I'm throwin' uuuuup!
DPGC nigga, you know what I'm throwin' uuuuup!
And it just don't stop, Dogghoused the fuck out
Like to say what's up to my cousin Bigg Snoop Dogg
Goldie Loc, Tray Deee, my nigga Soopafly
Mr. B-A-D, Mr. Kane, Latoia Williams, my nigga E-White
And I am Dat Nigga Daz
And we gonna keep it Dogghoused out motherfucker!
So all y'all can suuuck these nuts

[Snoop Dogg]
Now...you understand what we sayin'?
DPGC...Dogghouse
Dat Nigga D-A-Z, L-B-C
Eastside for lizie
Can you dig it?
Oh ya, by the way, Suge Knight is a fat, dick suckin', hatin' ass bitch...fucker!
Oh ya, fuck your wife too
No singin' ass bitch
Got Dr. Dre's dick on her breath</pre>
