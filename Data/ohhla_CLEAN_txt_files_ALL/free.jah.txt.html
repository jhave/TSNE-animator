[Chorus: Ashley Joi]
Gotta let me live, gotta let me do for me
Gotta let me learn, gotta let me finally be free
Even if I'm scared and it ain't fair
Gotta make it clear this heart here will be repaired
[x2]

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Follow in my foot steps and girl if you ain't scared I'm gonna be right
there, I'm a be the nigga you lean on, go on, let your mind state run free
Their ain't nothing but your open arms that can hold me
Like when I'm runnin, runnin hopin the world will keep up wit me
or when I'm runnin, gunnin wantin the world to stay away from me
Pray on, but your heart still wit me
Ain't nothing but your open arms that can free me
You know, that I'd miss every part of your body if you were gone
How the hell can a nigga be so surrounded and feel alone and why would I be
so selfish in helping stoppin your growth... I gotta let her go

[Chorus: Ashley Joi]
Gotta let me live, gotta let me do for me
Gotta let me learn, gotta let me finally be free
Even if I'm scared and it ain't fair
Gotta make it clear this heart here will be repaired
[x2]

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
How can I move on get alot together she can do better than me anyway
But she kept on callin me sayin Your so wrong when I'm wit you everyday
and I put up wit your bullshit, Your gonna make me lose it
Hold on when you know the bond between us is so Strong
But I had to let my angel spread her wings, and let her live and when she
did she sped off
and a nigga ain't seen her since. But I, I, know a kitten got nine lives and
I hope she stay on her feet and eventually come back to me her foolish is
pride when I look in her eyes I see shes the only one that's meant for me

[Chorus: Ashley Joi]
Gotta let me live, gotta let me do for me
Gotta let me learn, gotta let me finally be free
Even if I'm scared and it ain't fair
Gotta make it clear this heart here will be repaired
[x2]

[Hook: Ashley Joi]
I'm comin back
all of my love
Lovin you is the best thing I can do

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Every time I look in your eyes I see pain
and all the time that you spent away from me, babe
It's obviously driving the both of us crazy
even though you left me I know you don't hate me
(Your still my baby)
But I'm still runnin, runnin hopin this time you keep up wit me
and you keep comin comin back But baby this time don't leave
I gonna be right here wit you
(I know you'll be right here wit me)

[Chorus: Ashley Joi]
Gotta let me live, gotta let me do for me
Gotta let me learn, gotta let me finally be free
Even if I'm scared and it ain't fair
Gotta make it clear this heart here will be repaired
