[Intro: Layzie]
Yeah, I dedicate this one, to all the buddah lovers all across the world
All over the globe, from Amsterdam, to Humboldt County
Miami, Atlanta, Seattle, L.A., New York
You know how we do it baby, Montana
Blaze one up, sit back, and ride to this shit man (ssssmokin)

[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
This is for my weed heads, strictly for my weed heads
This is for my weed heads - the weed don't do no harm
This is for my weed heads, strictly for my weed heads
This is for my weed heads - it works just like a charm
Roll it up, smoke it up, you wanna get high you can toke with us
Nothin but bomb when you fuck with us - take two hits and pass it
Roll it up, smoke it up, you wanna get high you can toke with us
Nothin but bomb when you fuck with us - off two hits you're blasted

[Layzie Bone]
Man I can't believe it, I'm tweeded
Full of Grey Goose nigga I'm fried
Decided that night to drive
Fucked around and caught a DUI
Too much intoxication
Fucked up and I'm on probation
It's a jacked up situation
and now my P.O. is who I'm facin
Gotta take piss test after piss test
I'm so stressed that I might break
Another mistake I can't take
Can't violate my probate
In jail is no good
But smoke free I can't see
I'ma smoke 'til the day I D-I-E
That's just keepin it real about me

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
You want me to give up Indonesia
Hydroponics and chocolate thai?
Oh me, oh my!
I gotta get high, high, high
Mowie wowie, blueberry
Purple haze, don't tell me
You want me to give up smokin
You jokin cause you can't help me
Any raspberry flavored blunts
Steady yet, make that a Cognac
Hit this weed on contact
I'm high and I'm ready for combat
Can't believe this happenin to me
Got me doin community service
Got a thug got caught up in the system
Paranoid and I'm livin nervous
And you ask me is this worth it?
Look dawg, it's mandatory
That I creep and I smoke my reefa
That's me and this my story 

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
If they just legalize the weed man
it'd minimize our crime rate
Everybody be doin they own thang
with nobody have no time to hate
Saddam and Bush would blow a blunt
and I bet they wouldn't be thinkin 'bout war
They'd be gigglin with the munchies 
thinkin of ways that they can feed the poor
Shore to shore, sea to sea
We all want peace but it's in the leaf
That's my belief, it's in the leaf
and all you gotta do is smoke it with me
Roll it with me, toke it with me
Goin fifty on this pound
I'm tryin to get the world to smoke
So blaze it up and pass it around 

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
Take two hits and pass it
Off two hits you're blasted {*fades out*}</pre>
