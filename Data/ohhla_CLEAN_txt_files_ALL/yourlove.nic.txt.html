[Chorus]
Shawty Imma only tell you this once, you the illest (dat for dat dat dude)
And for your lovin' Imma Die Hard like Bruce Willis (bah ba dah dah oh)
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got something all the girls want
You're like a candy store
And I'm a toddler
You got me wantin' more and ma ma more of
Your love, your love (yeah) {repeat 4x}
Your love, your love {repeat 4x}

[Nicki Minaj]
He the type to pop tags and be cockin the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a du rag, keep his wave on swim
Wa waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S' on my chest cuz I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him, just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubberband
Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lam'
Hot damn make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
'S' on my chest let me get my cape on
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon
Convict, just like Akon
Cuz you know the snitches be putting the jake on

[Chorus]

Find me in the dark
I'll be in the stars
Find me in your heart
I'm in need of your love</pre>
