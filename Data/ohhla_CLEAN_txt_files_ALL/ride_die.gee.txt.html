[B.G.]
Uptown is my home, thats where I do my dirt
I either hurt or get hurt
It's me or you on that shirt
Cant let no nigga fix me
Cant let no nigga get me
I'ma draw and hit first, I cant let no nigga split me
Had my momma upset
Nigga, leave my ho pussy wet
I'm goin out with a fight, my chopper bullets eject 
I gets blowed and start
Ready to unload at war 
No witnesses 
You cant get on the stand and say you saw nothin bout nothin
Keep it shut or you dead
If you cant hush, open your mouth and you'll get ten in your head
That's how I play it nigga, I'll blackmail you wit you rown life
It aint right, disrespect you die on site 
That aint no might, that's a fact
You can believe that
Instead disrespect, i promise to be back
And clear the corner, you cant run, dont try
I'm high, bout mine ready to ride or die bitch


[Lil Wayne]
Load it up with black gats and macs
Pay attention to gun blastin 
And fake buster harassin
Smashin, dashin up yo street wit all the lights out 
Two choppers cocked ready to knot 
And chop up yo block
Lock all doors and keep windows closed
Cause we done rolled before
So stay on the floor
We ride deep in the all black camaro
Sittin on mo's 
And we rolls tokin on fat optimos
You chose to test those uptown boys
You done got on a straight ride and cant get off
Lets all get a stolen car
And roll through they ward
When it's dark
We spark, pull up then draw
You done falled in war
Got in a big brawl
Thought hard but you wrong
So you still get scarred
Y'all boys done played wit some all out kill niggas
Jump in hot cars, cut the deck then deal niggas
Still niggas for testin these big lil niggas
Still niggas for messin with these real trill niggas
Young niggas, chopper totin big gun niggas
Front nigga and live your life on the run nigga
Stunt nigga and get plugged, drug through the mud
Puddles of blood flood
You cant swim so you done
Niggas start to look
And see the all black crook
Some booked, some get high
Some hot on one foot
Spots gettin took, whole bodies gettin dropped
Niggas hop, jock, and flock  
When I hit they block

(Chorus)
So ride or die bitch
Chop or get chopped ho
B.G., split or get split
Play the game how it go(4x)

[Juvenile]
Why is you sayin them words, bo janglin, why dont you show yo face
Would you dust me or somthin, you must know you gonna catch a case
I'm a straight head bust ya
Seperate and destruct ya
Dont wanna have no Juvey wanna make a ghost or few
What am I'm supposed to back down or somthin cause you got a lil click
All that frownin and reppin shit
Gone get ya down in a devil ditch
Never miss, I be drivin niggas wit cleverness
Momma used to say this
Use your mind and stay rich
Pops used to say boy dont let them niggas see your weakness
If a fool get outta line with you knock him off his feet quick
Why is you showin yo teeth you dont speak
Stay on your side of the street, you cant be mobb'n with me 
I cant have no bitches followin me
Gotta Mac-10 and you aint even bust back
And your boy got hit in the back 
What type of nigga is that

(Hook)
That's why I stay in all black
Get the Mac and go back
You done fucked wit C-M-R-ah
They'll be no tommorrow(2x)

(Chorus)

[B.G.]
Get you a chopper and tote it
Dont just buy it to have it
Nigga have it to use it
Better grab it and shoot it
Better know one thing nigga will do it to you
Before you do it to them to survive, gotta be true
Nigga think just cause we squashed that beef, thats it
You might be thinkin like me, I think forgive and dont forget 
I gotta trick under my sleeve
Ridin four deep wit artillary
Me and Tootie, Papa, and Cleeve 
It's an unsolved mystery
I'm a fly til I got ya, yo peoples eyes watery 
I hit a artery
Bein real to CMB, it's a part of me 
Cross me I charge you wit some flamin hot heat 
Two twenty-three blazed all in yo chest
Brain waves you dazed up
You see death stare you straight in your face
Get waked up cause I left ya stretch for the hurse
I take no chance for you to ride, nigga I ride first

(Chorus)</pre>
