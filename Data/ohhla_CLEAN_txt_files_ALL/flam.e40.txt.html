[Baby]
Now look - Mercedes wagons with buck eyes 
Lorenzo Kits with TV's inside
Twenty inch (*bling, bling*) that's platinum
Jumped out the hummer nigga with the fist to mack em
This is a parking lot pimping and bitches

And we gap 'em twenty inch couldn't fit - adapt to slap 'em
Get the matching house at over east that's platinum

Straight up ghetto star "Star"- Darnel from 310 (OHH)
Niggas (???) glove compartment for my strap
Climate control, Air-Conditioner , A/C in tha back
Interior (?) with a typey on my lap
Officer Smokey and Mr. Johnny Law swear I sell crack

With the black screens, dash and who order the sunlights? 
 
[Baby]
Everything black or silver - I'm macking
Weezy We gat a Beamer thats platinum 
Supposed to be a Low-Low on 18 and adapting
Bitch thats not a movie and nigga we ain't acting
Cadillac truck got hot - I paint it platinum
And I know a bitch in oakland named Platinum
Talk about how she could eat the dick off the platter
I'm the #1 stunner bitch and I'm Mack
(And I'm Mack, and I'm Mack...)
