[Chorus]
I been in this game for years
It made me an animal
I fallin and I cant cant
I been in this game for years
It made me an animal
I been in this game for years
It made me an animal
I fallin and I cant cant
I been in this game for years
It made me an animal
Animal

[Verse 1]
These lil niggas
Got no idea bout how I got here
Hard road traveled nigga
Blood sweat gravel
I done seen niggas battle
Knew the dirt and neva tattled
OG's know I'm solid
Imma concrete statue
Never got an earring, gold teeth, nor a tattoo
Wolf in sheeps clothes
Curren$y in creep mode
Even though it's strength in numbers
I tend to fall back in my world without my brothers
Figure out what my purpose on this earth is
Because I know it got to be about more
Than stuntin and fuckin whores
I done drove every car
And bought everything out the store
Crib with marble floors
But i still get bored
I figure that I escape the madness
Cuz I'm rappin
But I'm just as stressed out as my lil homie who trappin
Smoke and got asthma
And I know that's ass backwards
Fly and spit fire I'm a dragon..

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Night fall I'm in the whip
Or I'm in the club
In the vip
With my paws on anotha niggas bitch
Knowin that I got my own
She's at home
But still I roam
Cause I don't know what she doin when I'm gone
It done happened before
And I prolly got more shit commin
From fuckin wit my old homeboy woman
And I don't even know why I did that
He'll prolly try to kill me
If he knew where i lived at
Prolly neva speak again
And I cant blame em
Last thing he said was that I'm changin
And I ain't even halfway famous
But once this hustle becomes apart of you
It hardens you
Puttin darkness in the heart of you
Homie I only got 1 in my heart for few
And that's my crew
And with those dudes
I hunt for food
Candle ass niggas betta move
Forreal

[Chorus]</pre>
