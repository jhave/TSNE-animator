[Chorus: Ellie]
Where do I begin
To tell you all the things I feel when you're with me?
The day we met I knew I'd fall so easily
You must believe you're givin' everything I need
Never to much..

[Ghostface Killah]
Snatched the Princess
Tricks keep searchin for the glass slipper
The first time the brides maid zipped the zipper
Then walked down the aisle, look at little pretty Roxanne's smile
That's right, she big head child
Spot the glass on the hand, white valor laying across the floor
Draggin' damn, she got a good man
Family in the back, one half on both sides of the church
Look at Keisha in the tight ass skirt
Mom Duke in the front row, Grandma Pearl sittin right next our row
Beside Uncle Joe, then right before her eyes
The preacher ask, "Would it to death do you part if one dies?"
She replies, "Yes", the winnin words that described best
Grandma pinned sittin 30 on the right breast
Now she searchin for the slob-down, the block's slick vitamin joint
Mad water in her eyes at this point
The man holdin the Bible announces, "You're married for life
Sign my cheque, peace to the bridal"
Recall this one girl's marriage, one girl's carriage
One with the lucky fingers, grab it, she attracted to magnet
She might have cracked the safe, seen the cabbage
Now it's one love in the tablet

[Chorus: Ellie]
How do I begin
To show you I love you anywhere, it ain't no sin?
This love will outlast time, I can't remember when
I thought I lost you but now that you're in my arms
Just say you'll stay

[C-Wiggs]
Cobra popped, a bottle of black Burgundy, coversated
I stared at your green eyes stagnated, your butter milk skin
You smelled good but you taste even better
Eye ball walk/talk was first on the agenda
I 'member the first time we engaged in the act, in the ac'
You jumped on my lap and pushed the seat back
Passionate thoughts, I knew you would be the wiz
Now you hold my kids, my divine little wiggs
The grand souflan cuz of your presence
So I'ma take it back to the essence just like Valentine presents
Long tongues and wet kisses, sex positions
Buy habista, siesta key, Florida visits
You exquisite young heart, I held you by afar, unchained
Our physical's 33 within the Range
Things have changed over the course of time
But you are mine, and I'm yours
I'm lookin forward to you after tours

[Chorus: Ellie]
How do I begin
To show you I love you anywhere, it ain't no sin?
This love will outlast time, I can't remember when
I thought I lost you but now that you're in my arms
Just say you'll stay
Lalalalala, whoa, whoa, whoa
Lalalalala, whoa, whoa, whoa
