[Andre Nickatina]
Rap cat, like that
Top of the line freak, I gotta get scratch
Don't waste time on a rat
Mickey Mouse ho step back, Mickey Mouse ho step back
I'm in high pursuit for a prostitute
In my baby blue suit, in my new leather boots
The game gets sticky wanna know about mines
I live my life through your car Alpine
Don't talk back, ho you thick
In this club ho who you wit?
Holla back, don't be fake like fruit
I spits my game if I think you cute
I talk about the izm with Sugar EQ
Anybody else well I don't know you
You love that freak cause you dress real fresh
She said good night but she don't rest
She might say daddy after twelve A.M.
Don't even play bitch, go and paid that pimp
Roll around the Bay bitch get that bread
In-call, out-call, freak go 'head
You can even walk down San Pablo
Let a player tell you what your mind don't know
I'm Fillmoe down everyday
I might laugh bitch but I really don't play
Roll my whip, spit my gift
Bitch holla back, but don't talk back
I could see the ho lust in yo eyes
You got it past him but couldn't get past I
I dress like Cody Jerrett when I gotta knock somethin
The beats start bumpin when the freaks start humpin
Bring home somethin, don't make no mistakes
Why you talkin to the suckas buyin you dranks?
They lookin for a dream, you lookin for the cream
Holla at me freak yo Khan nah mean
You can realize bitch a big surprise
I can see a picture frame in yo eyes
I see Van Gogh, I see Picasso
I also see a rap cat from Fillmoe
That's a nice style let me lace your boots
This game is so official like a referee's whistle
Chicago, Fillmoe, Milwaukee, O-A-K, Frisco Bay
Hey! Area Bay love Mac Dre</pre>
