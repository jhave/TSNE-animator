[Intro: Peedi Crakk]
Yea, uhhh
SP, Peedi muthafuckin Crack
CPR

[Verse 1: Peedi Crakk]
Every time I'm in the buildin', they feelin' me all crazy
Just made a million and spent it with yo lady
Re-coupin, chilled and V couped it
White Nikes duke swoosh shit that's how I do shit
Listen to my new shit
It's way betta than that dirt that yall producing nigga
The hood rich bent on good shit for a minute
Naw I finished I need that GT Bent, I can see me all in it(all in it)
Couple TV's breezin' light tinted
SP representa
Local husky on the fender nigga
Ya I'm back like I live in this bitch
I bought a gat, a couple ounces of lick
It's P. Crack, ain't nuttin' changed
I'll burn a pound in this bitch
And for my change, I'll bust a round in this bitch
SP prince of prop, put my crown on my shit
My hand in a brick
I'm runnin' wit the ROC and my handle is sick
Biatch
Nigga, nigga..

[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]
Cuz every time on my grind it's like gangstas fuckin' wit us (wit us)
Ok, ok and they run up and bust (up and bust.. up and bust)
Cuz every time on my grind It's like gangstas fuckin' wit us (wit us)
Nigga.. nigga

[Verse 2: Peedi Crakk]
Crakk in the kitchen, position with hot agua
Caliente yay bubble like hot lava
Coke problem ho.. and my revolver knows..
About the size of ok coral ohhhh..
Factious bastard mashed with the mattic
Half black half Hispanic you a faggot
Blast gat, trash that, metal with the side and back at it
Jackrabbit style no condo, no one behind him
Gangstas done signed him
Shined him, refined him, thanks for the fine wine, nigga
Peedi Crakk holla back no problem
Them thousand stacks, have it back in an hour
Hit the block with powder, like shower to shower
Stop all that nonsense boy
I got you sniffin' on that Johnson &amp; Johnson crack.. holla..nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Sparks]
They say its a white man's world (white man's world)
I'm steady shootin' at my own kind rather fuck the next man's girl
Instead of going home to mine with a polluted mind
I guess going nuts others saw how they get down
Picked up on the game and left behind follow the sign
I kept my head to the sky even when I was down like everything was fine
Kept a smile (smile nigga)
Like the first day I was introduced to dinin'
And got to sipping and thinking all sorts of shit start going through my mind
Like State Prop. get it on until the end of time
The strippers and the numbers then I started thinking bout all them little bustas
That done crossed the motherfucka got to peeking at my burner
Snatch my keys off the dresser ran through the door and I hopped up in the squada
Started creeping through the heat of the night on these jokers
Don't I paint the perfect picture that's how the boy get down for the figures
Holla back nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
