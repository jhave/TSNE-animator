[Intro: Chest Rockwell]
Now come over here, and let me give you a tongue kiss...
on yo' hot pocket

[El-P]
Me and Mike'll go Twin Hype and do a dance on your windpipes
Put your fuckin jazz hands back in your pants or get them shits sliced
Caught the ghost when I was yay high, so today I stay way high
Do not worry 'bout my habits, without sin I'd prol'ly hate life

[Killer Mike]
This is dope as that hard white you stuff in a crack pipe
A hit of this, a kid with Tourette's will chill out and act right
I'm fat but I dress nice, and bitches finesse Mike
They suck the dick and squeeze on my belly like bagpipes

[El-P]
I slap and I suck clits, I fuck in my church shoes
Humblest guy in the room and I am in the room too (get it?)
I'll bend you over on the roof while whistling Audio Two
They say that once a girl go Brooklyn no more soft dick'll do

[Killer Mike]
I'm so Rakim and Eric B, bitches check out +My Melody+
I might Slick Rick on a fella - FOUL! Catch me a felony
Hey, I might Shyne Po a hoe - POW! Catch me a case
Producto must have rolled this L because this blunt feel laced!

[Interlude: Chest Rockwell]
I must say you do look stunning
I mean, you're the kind of girl 
I can really see myself artificially inseminating
Oh I'm sorry, I'm being a little aggressive, right?
Can we start from the beginning? 
My name is Chest Rockwell, right? 
And I love to make LOVE... to yo' booty...hole
Bad Boy

[El-P]
This is born alone die alone, so my dialogue's dastardly
Life's a tragedy generator operating at max capacity
This is porno for piraters, to the crooks it is relaxing
I am foreign to that soft talk, you can tell it from my accent

[Killer Mike]
This is arrogant fat black, it is what it is
This that stingy with dick, bitch, not a fuck do I give
I'm no respecter of person, I'm no respecter of rules
I catch the prince of England slipping, he gon' run me the jewels
I could wake up brain dead tomorrow and my soliloquy still'll be
The illest there'll ever be cause I be what you'll never be
My pugnacious rhyme patterns prove pitbull in my pedigree
And dogs fight to the death, you say you better, you better be!

[El-P]
Not one shit given, El-P's chillin
Raised in a shack in the back of the village
Trained by the wolves in the woods to avenge 
on the men who elected themselves my killers
Mike's a villain, Nick Hooks chillin
We don't have a need to know your feelings
We don't believe in the same shit anyway 
Run the Jewels in not for your children

[Outro: Chest Rockwell]
How you feeling now sweetheart? A little more relaxed?
Maybe it's that half a molly I put in your Mountain Dew
Yeah, works like a charm 
Just chill out for a second, relax, RELAX
I got it under control, I got you a glass of Beefeater
I got a brand new deck of Uno cards
Oh yeah baby, the night's just getting started...
Okay, how 'bout I come over tonight 
and pick you up in my brand new Segway?
We can go over to Long John Silvers, get a fish platter
You can take me home and massage me with butter all on my neck
I love you!</pre>
