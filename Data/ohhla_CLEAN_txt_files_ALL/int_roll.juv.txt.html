Look a here, look a here, look a here
New Mannie, Louisiana up in here ya heard me
With the Project English album,
And I'm gonna let young Mickey start this thing off, ya heard me
The New Orleans shit, the new stunna, the new shiner, the new reppa
Walk over here and get cha' shine on

[Mickey]
Uh oh, Chicago's with those N.O. niggas
And we stock indo nigga
Ya see the amount of blood in my kinfolk niggas
And I don't think y'all really understand what y'all in fo' nigga
When a nigga got tens he got two blocks on em'
Catch ya mob street walkin' put them foo fights on em'
MC rodie around, we say fam or pharaoh
Both our families mo' gangsta than the damn Sopranos
They spit choppers and k's, we spray itchies
But we both quick to spray fifty, stay with me
They rock tees and Rees, we rock furs and Nikes
But we both well known for flippin' birds and ice
They stay stunnin a hundred, we say flickin'
They say that shit is fire, we say sendin' fendin'
Get little, that mean we about to leave
The cake is baked whodi, that mean y'all about to bleed

[Mannie Fresh]
Uh oh, shit got damn, you know who I am
I'm as gangsta as Capone in this nasty ass fam
Where the fuck I'm from and where I represent
Platinum plaques, Bentleys, and presidents
Now wait a minute man, I done bought a choo-choo train
Don't chu' have a helicopter, yeah and a plane
You got a two-way pager, well I gotta phone
You gotta a million dollars, well I got I don't know
They say a nigga like me bling too much
Why, cause this watch, this chain, this ring too much
Make them dollars, pop them bottles
We zoned up in Caprices and Impalas (Errrr!)
Disregard that law, pop that car
Step up in the club and buy out the whole bar
Pay attention lil' daddy to the song I'm sangin'
I'ma put cha' on some other shit besides that blang
Daddy truck sharp, mama house bangin'
Brian Williams, just keep on brangin'
Check after check every time ya move ya neck
Nigga if i want it dog I'll buy respect

[Baby]
There you have it nigga, Project English nigga (Uh, uh, uh)
Hood rats and bling blingin' nigga (Uh, uh, uh)
Know what I'm sayin' let's get this money nigga (It go choo-choo)
Hey steppa, hey Mike, stick, pass that bottle motherfucker
We gon' drank till we ain't got no mo' dollars motherfucker
Let's go get this money Fresh
Project English and whatever it come with next
Cash Money, Hot Boyz let's ride nigga
Go to the next tune or something fucker

[Mannie Fresh]
The only plaques I have, are platinum plaques, ya heard</pre>
