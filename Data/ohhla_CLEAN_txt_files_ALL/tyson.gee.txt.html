(Mighty mighty)

Now
I'm gonna tell you a little story 'bout a man I like
He goes by the name of Mighty Mike
Tyson is his name, boxing is his game
Well, he's the greatest, goin straight to the Hall of Fame
He don't float like a butterfly or sting like a bee
But he's the hardest damn puncher you'll ever see
He don't stick and move, he don't weave and bob
But there ain't a heavyweight that can do his job
He do damage to your body, do work on your head
You wind up flat on your back like the canvas was your bed
Well, you can dance around, or you can go toe to toe
But if you fight Mighty Mike, he's gonna lay you low

Mighty Mike
(Mighty mighty)

Well, he's the king of the ring, knows how to do that thing
And he'll knock your butt out just like it ain't no thing
He'll pop you, stop you, then he'll drop you
You wanna know who's gonna win? Sure not you
Well I'm takin bets, 10 and above
I haven't lost a bet yet ever since I discovered

Mighty Mike
(Mighty mighty)

Now my friends keep tellin me, my girl keeps jealin me
She seen Mike fight and got excited, then fell on me
Now I don't know what it is, but maybe you do
When Mike fights, it's just like voodoo
No matter what you do, you'll always lose
I'm not the preacher, but I've got some good news
About Mike

(Mighty mighty)
Mighty Mike

(Ladies and gentlemen
The undefeated
Undisputed
Heavyweight
Champion of the world
Iron Mike Tyson)

He's very soft spoken, but the man hits hard
Don't sleep on him and don't drop your guard

Cause he'll pop you, stop you, then he'll drop you
You wanna know who's gonna win? Sure not you
Well, I'm takin bets 10 and above
I haven't lost a bet yet ever since I discovered

Mighty Mike
(Mighty might)

Go put your best dress on, girl, and look real pretty
Tonight Mike's fightin at Atlantic City
Got my white Tux on, chauffeur's outside
A Caddy stretch limo's gonna be our ride
When we get to the fight, well, we won't be beat
As we watch Mike fight from the front row seats
Now I can't look into the future, I can't tell how long
The fight will go, but this I know, and I won't be wrong
When the bell rings and the deal goes down
Mighty Mike will still be wearin his champion's crown
He's Mighty Mike</pre>
