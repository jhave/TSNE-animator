Freaky deaky, Trick Daddy and Yours truly Buddy Rizoe

J.T. Money
Yeah, and that nigga, J.T. Motherfucker check it out

See I'm a pimp, you motherfuckers better know
'Cause when I find out my bitch ain't shit I MIGHT let her go
'Cause a ho gon be a ho, nigga that's in the game
So all you niggas that be taking them out and buying thangs
That's less I got to do plus that bitch fed
I get her for half of everything plus some of that smokin' head
So what the fuck? You'se a duck.  Nigga spend your flow
See I know you just want to say you fucked my ho
But that ain't shit 'cause I ain't never been a sucker
I'll let you have that hoe, nigga I bet you I can still fuck her
Better recognizer, I'm the bitch-izer
Next time you see your hoe your bitch'll have her thighs up
On a flick with this dick off inside her
Show you how to ride her
I'll make that pussy wider
You marks ain't got nathan for me
I'll make your baby mama leave you and tell you she love me
So who's the motherfucking man now?
You can never outdo me dawg and never understand why
This goes deeper than just dollars and cents
You keep breaking off them hos and that money keeps getting spent
'Cause I'm a pimp, now let me hear you say it

Other creeps can't compete with this pimp in me
I'm chaufered round In this '97 photo fleet

I'm getting bread out you bitches 'cause I'm able
You got me looking like a million bucks
Turning tricks suckin up dicks and lickin hella nuts
'Cause I'm the real
Ain't no need for you to bill me

If you see me walking down the street, and I'm lookin fly-hy

Walk on by

Trick Daddy
Yes sir
I wear my pants hanging off my ass, a Class A pimp
And I walk with this gangsta ass limp
Some call me sir Trick, or even mack baby
I got these girls down south going Trick Crazy
Now come take a walk with your future mack
So we can discuss all our future plans
This is my lady never disrespect her
Or your sure to get fucked up
If you see me with another ho
Baby just let it go
'Cause it aint worth getting your neck broke
Bitch, I'm wearing the pants, I'm the law man
Just put your money in my gotdamn hand
'Cause I'm your pimp, pimp, now let me hear you say it

Spoken
Pimpin hoes ain't dead, 
My eyes is red mother fucker
Smoking trees and B's
I got many hoes on they knees
From pittsburgh to mexico
