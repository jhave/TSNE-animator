Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I had to be like 15
My dawg ain't have his ills but copped a Cutlass Supreme
Clean from an old white dude, he got a deal
And at the gas station where he got killed
Late night filling up
Niggas shot him up
Asleep when the call came, news when I woke up
17, carjacked, dead at the Mobil
I swear I shed a tear every time I see a photo
Now I'm all grown up same spot [?]
Old school Chevy check the rear view mirror
Give a bum a buck, show the hood niggas love
Pocket full of kush so I hit them with a nug
My homie left the hood, I ain't seen him in a minute
Pull up smoking reggie with his bitch in a rental
He said "I just got out" and can I let him hold something
I told him that I'm broke, man I ain't got nothing

[Chorus]
And I'm out (aight then)
In a '87 Cutty about to go pick up a light skin
And I'm out (aight then)
Blowing on some kush the color Minnesota Viking
And I'm out (aight then)
Catch me swooping up a freak and I'm knowing how my night end
And I'm out (aight then)
Saying killa has some lightning [?]

See this is all we know
Just running round the hood dawg with nowhere to go
Wanna grab some swishers but the narcs at the store
So we parked at my man's, put the chronic on hold
So now we just posting, drinking on some 40s
My nigga got his 40 said drop him at his shorty's
Told my nigga chill, about to roll one with hash
Soon as the hook leave then my nigga we can smash
All in rotation, puff puff passin'
Eyes like cherries through magnifying glasses
Think I got the munchies, my nigga, you hungry?
Bout to ride to courttown grab us some munchies
The blunt turned to ash, gave a [?] and laughed
Drunk the rest of the 40, threw the bottle in the trash
Made sure I had my phone, grabbed a square out the pack
Gave my homie that, jumped in the Cutty and I smashed

And I'm out (aight then)
In a '87 Cutty about to go pick up a light skin
And I'm out (aight then)
Blowing on some kush [?]
And I'm out (aight then)
Catch me swooping up a freak and I'm knowing how my night ends
And I'm out (aight then)
Saying killa has some lightning [?]</pre>
