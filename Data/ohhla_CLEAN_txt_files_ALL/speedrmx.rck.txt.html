[DJ Khaled]
Remix, Speedin' Remix, the movement
I introduced you to the projects, I introduced you to the hood
I introduced you to the ghet-to, I introduced you to Rick Ross
The Boss is back, Trilla
This the remix, Speedin' Remix (Ross got me Speedin' baby)
We the best

[Plies]
This for all my goons, workin' on pills
Speedin' to make me run in yo crib
Put they 'opper behind yo ear
Monkey suit, black mask, City Boy gear
Slippin' got a lot of niggaz whacked this year
Been up two days straight homie, no sleep
Ridin' with choppers lurkin' fo' deep
Jumpin' out on the first thing, look sweet
Double 'stangs got the goons grittin' teeth
Car full of throw away big boy heat
Two brand new K's hangin' off seats
Yeah it got me Speedin' all week

[Birdman]
G4 straight from the N.O.
We get money, stay fly till the next show
We got money, stay fly till we get mo'
We got bitches, high rollin' with this cash flow
Put the H in the hood
Put a one on the good
Put a slab on the wood
Shit, me and Ross doin' good
One hundred million dollars nigga, hangin' in the hood

[Busta Rhymes]
Check, I'm doin' donuts in the streets (Streets), pedal to the glass (Glass)
My lord have Murciélago max on the dash
Speedin' niggaz can't see me in the blink of a flash
You got to slow motion to flick so you can see me when I pass
You know just what to do when you see me give me my cash
When I pull up drop the bags of bread then I'm doing a dash
No confusion understand no gimmicks
Duke is like the Autobahn, disregardin' the speed limits
Fast life, fast broads, let's get it fast buddy
Fast food, fast cars, we gettin' fast money
Fuck the talk we been doin' this, heat it up
And when you bringin' me my cake you better speed it up

[Hook - R. Kelly with DJ Drama ad-libs]
Fast life, I live, big cars, big cribs
Speeeeed, Speedin'
Speeeeed, I'm speedin'
I can't stop it's all I know
From a young'n I was taught to get dough
Speeeeed, Speedin'
Speeeeed, I'm speedin'

[Webbie]
It's all a big ricky in my brand new Bentley
Doing a buck fifty finna to get another meal ticket
I ain't bein' funny I don't see the competition
Since a young'n get the money all I ever comprehended
Business hall ass, ball 'til you fall yeah
Y'all sit on y'all ass, now I see why y'all mad
I'm leaving y'all ass, I ain't seein' y'all ass
Ever cross that line I'm puttin' three in y'all face, speedin'

[Gorilla Zoe]
Seventeen five, god damn lie
Country niggaz payin' damn near twenty five
Who gon' pick 'em up, pick 'em up first flight
Call Ricky Ross, hell yeah high five
Throw them in the trunk (Trunk) I'll tape them to the fender (Fender)
Scrapin' off the plate like a nigga's eatin' dinner
I'm speedin' shorty you trippin'
If you see the blue lights homie I'm dippin'

[Fat Joe]
Niggaz want hood rep the hood back
Shit Joey the Don they call me Cook Crack
If you look at 'em wrong you get it pushed back
From rags to riches and never look back
I'm watchin' pelicans fly me and Rick racin' Diddy on boats
Throwin' money in the air and you niggaz is jokes
New York, New York big city of dreams
I'm a hustler baby I'm addicted to CREAM
I'm talking money, cars, hoes, bitches
Cap a damn suit let the feds take pictures
Eighty eight pose just me and my niggaz
Thank god for that white if you feelin' religious

[Torch]
I grew up on the crime side the New York time side
Nickel and dimes to survive
Fresh out the can, million dollar plans
Tryin' to triple up that weed money Know'm sayin'
Precise with the white pirates a job my job to make it hard
Only way up out the hood rap, crack, or playin' ball
Ain't nobody touchin' the plate if I ain't eatin'
Fuck it hand me two twenty on the dash let me see it, Torch

[Gun Play]
Rest in peace Chad Butler, I'll see you when I get there
But for now I'm doin' ninety in a cigarette with bitches
Lookin' back on last year laughin' at the mirror
I'm on TV, I look a little clearer
You look a little worried, chill and come and smell the money in the bag
I'm a crash, too many hundreds on the dash
Killer come ride with me, know what I mean, holla at me
Trilla, Gun Play, triple c I'm outta here

[Hook - R. Kelly with DJ Bigga Rankin ad-libs]

[Flo Rida]
Flo Rida, I was born to digital dash
I go ghetto miles per hour, no speed pass
A Dale Earn knock out my momma pregnant as fast
They said that he my daddy
It's "Good Times" Junior NASCAR but in a caddy
Speedin' this time the snitches won't tell
I was MTV when the ball dropped playa
Tila in my tequila before I struck out the twelve
Big Apple with apple bottoms the haters can go to hell
Number one on billboard, Mr. Rubber Band boy
Like a boy-yoy-yoing, bounce back in my tom force
Got the nitro in the Ford, Alicia Keys with the chords
Fast cars, I want more

[Brisco]
I'm livin' life in the fast lane with no L's or brakes
Why should I care about tomorrow when I'm doin' it today
No insurance on the Chevy but it's OK
Tell them catch me if they can while I'm speedin' away
Ridin' H.O.V., I'm sprayin' nitrous so they can't see me
See me I'm P.O.E.
Everytime I come around
And I would if I could but I can't slow down

[Rick Ross]
What they need just to give a nigga life
Give him twenty years just to feed a nigga rice
Put me in a hole just to let me see the light
Cuz some niggaz out here free ain't even livin' right
Five star G's, my car lease
If we gotta eat puttin' H on the streets
Heroin haven, heroin graven
You would think I was a heroin baby
It's a new year, new year, new money, money
New Louie shoes and they cost a few hundred
Left the tip case still bought them new Tommy's
Got mo' scrilla for niggaz with new drama, Boss

[Lil' Wayne]
Young Money, hookin' up with Ross
Top way back left foot up out the Porsche
Right foot flat, I'm good up in the Porsche
Err, there go Shaq tryin' to pull up on the Porsche
But I burn that cop on my way to Opa-Locka
Brisco holla back, I'll be at here in fact
Like I left somethin' soon as I left somethin'
Told me go to Damon's and just go and Weezy F somethin'
Ferrari F run Lamborghini test run
They call me weather man I make it rain and my chest sunny
Yes honey I don't give a damn about the rest honey
Cash Money, Young Money never ever less money
All we do is get money, all we do is bet money
All we do is let money, go and get money
Now that's money, Young Weezy
[*Beat stops*]
Baby, ha ha
And this was the remix baby</pre>
