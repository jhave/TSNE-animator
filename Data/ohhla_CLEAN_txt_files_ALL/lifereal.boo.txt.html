These are the words of a real nigga
NIGGA
Figure of speech

Boosie Bad Azz
Look Look Look
The way you live the life of a real nigga
Be a real nigga

All the way gangsta

Believe that
Da words of a real nigga
Talk to 'em nigga
Look nigga

From sun down to sun up
Be bout ya come up (be bout ya come up)
Ya wake up to get ya cake up
Be bout ya paper (be bout ya paper)
Never snitch 
Take your silence to tha grave wit ya (grave wit ya)
Give back to tha hood
If you a made nigga (made nigga)
If you a daddy then you got responsibility (nigga)
Dead beats close your ears 
You aint feeling me (pussy)
You say you thuggin'
If you thuggin' live or die by it (we live or die by it)
You say you hustling
Teach your click to be wise by it
Keep ya tool on ya mane
You know tha rules (know da rules)
Them real nigga in college 
You gotta wake up for school (they real to)
Hustle
What you doing for a living
You satisfied wit the money you getting
You aint no real nigga (they say you aint no real nigga)
Respect ya elders
Believe me you'll live longer (yes mama)
My nigga kids, my kids
That's how we live homie
Tha pin don't make you realer
Then the next nigga (pin life)
I'm straight G this fuckin' jeweler don't make me (Fuck no)

No man or women shall separate us 
That me shit

Forgive me god its G shit
I lay down law
I keep it real wit niggas
If gonna play games

Buck nigga

Chorus(2x)
Money don't make me
I'm straight G, I'm straight gangsta
The words of a real nigga (real nigga)
No man or women shall separate me ( my nigga)
The words of a real nigga

Ole school ran into me
Told me even when ya bread low (bread low)
Nigga never keep ya head low (head low)
If that's ya girl, love ya girl
Fuck what ya nigga say
But he suppose to speak his mind
If he feel that way (my nigga)
If you a boss break it off
When its bond time (my bond)
Cause you know it was fucked up one time (fucked up)
One time already know
Shid call my lawyer (call him now)
Tell him I plead the 5th (plead da 5th)
And they done bugged my charger (bugged my charger)
Hustle harder wake up early and get on your grind
If you a soldier be a soldier till it came yo time
Niggas jealous in this world and they dirty to (dirty to)
For a lil fame and a big name they'll murder you

Chorus 2x

Boosie Bad Azz

I told all my niggas
No man or women shall separate what we create
Some niggas died
Some niggas joke
Some niggas ball and make it
Some niggas fake and say they real in every fuckin' verse 
Them hope to bees and wannabees 
They gone say it first
Don't it hurt deep inside
When a nigga turn bitch
Let a bitch take his figures
Separate his niggas
Aint it funny wit tha money 
Everything change
You keep it real wit yo nigga in tha chain gang
When it all fall down can you maintain
Stay real stay silent without no fuckin' violence
If a nigga crossed the line
Would you solve the problem
I got yo back nigga 
I got yo back nigga

Real niggas
I'ma send this motherfucker here
I'ma send this bitch to all my real niggas
Cross the world
Who live by or die by whatever they do
Weather hustling rap hustling
going to school hustling 
or block hustling whatever you do
this for my real niggas
money don't make boosie bad azz 
Torrance Hatchet
Just me just me
That's it
imma take all this jeweler off right now
still me</pre>
