[Dee:] Ice, I would like to ask you a few questions!
[Ice-T] Yeah, yeah, what is it? - what is it? Come on
[Dee:] Is it true, that you and your organization still have under world connections?
[Ice-T] Haa, absolutely not! - where did you get that information from?
[Dee:] Is it a fact, that most of your lyrics were true?
[Ice-T] Noh, it's all fantasies, you know, you just make the stuff up, rap is fake!

[Dee:] 
Ummm.. well, government officials still say 
That you're connected with major crime figures?

[Ice-T] 
I don't know what they talk about, it's a joke!
I make movies, I make records

[Dee:] 
So you swear to the public and deny any and all criminal ties?  
Even though, your music states other wise!

[Ice-T] 
Absolutely! I mean totally legit
Never done anything wrong, you know what I'm saying?
It's all a fantasy, that it's making the stuff up
You know, cause I'm a black man, they're trying to keep me down!
Hey, I'm totally innocent, you know what I'm saying?
Give me a break for life!</pre>
