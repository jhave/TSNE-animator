[Verse One: RBX]
Cannabis Sativa, ha ha, or in the heart of L.A. known as the Chronic
Not to be confused with the Bionic
Even though, it does cost six million dollars
Man, understand, ah, ha, ha
Now, we're working with some new improved shit on this track
Nevertheless, not no stress, sucker ass niggaz!!
So now we're gonna move on and uhh...
Light a big fat one up for the world; and hit this
Once or twice and you'll be twice as nice, get it?
This is the Chronic, ahh, hha, hha

[Interlude #1: Ruben]
Play that motherfucker out there, nigga!!

[Chorus: Emmage, Daz Dillinger &amp; Jewell]
Make my Bud the Chronic, I wants to get fucked
Make my shit the Chronic, I gots to fire it up
I want the bomb, I want the Chronic
I gots to get fucked up
Make my Bud the Chronic, before I take it home

[Verse Two: RBX]
Stay in my last joint, don't fuck with me fool
Pass the bud, Who got the dope sacks?
WooooooWheee, this is shouting a motherfucker, man
[Snoop Dogg] You can take it or leave it, nigga
But I need a spliff right now
[Lady of Rage] Roll this shit up then, nigga
And I don't want no Sess, brother
It's got to be the Chronic, you know what I mean, nigga?
(*Inhale*) Yeah, that's the Chronic
That's the Chronic, that's the Bomb bud
[Lady of Rage] You ain't never lied, nigga
Now, get me a motherfucking Zig-Zag and we're straight
[Snoop Dogg] Yeah nigga, I got some of that
Or better yet, a motherfucking blunt 
[Lady of Rage] I got that shit 
A Philliy blunt that is
[Lady of Rage] See you dog

[Chorus: Emmage, Daz Dillinger &amp; Jewell X2]
Make my Bud the Chronic, I wants to get fucked
Make my shit the Chronic, I gots to fire it up
I want the bomb, I want the Chronic
I gots to get fucked up
Make my Bud the Chronic, before I take it home

[Interlude #2: RBX]
God, damn, I'm fucked up!!
[Lady of Rage] Damn, I'm fucked up too
That shit ain't no joke, awww, shit
No, I want no more, I want shit
Just leave me alone, just let me chill out
And listen to this shit, I'm high!

[Chorus: Emmage, Daz Dillinger &amp; Jewell X2]
Make my Bud the Chronic, I wants to get fucked
Make my shit the Chronic, I gots to fire it up
I want the bomb, I want the Chronic
I gots to get fucked up
Make my Bud the Chronic, before I take it home

[Verse Three: RBX]
That's fucked up, what they put in this weed?
That's why they call this shit Chronic
[Lady of Rage] I think your ass is high
Uhh, damn, damn, damn, shit
Fucked up, fucked up, fucked, raises the fuck up
Really though, really though
Now, I'm cooler than a motherfucker
That shit, that shit is, that shit's crazy, man
I'm high, damn, that nigga Dre served some shit now..
Oohhhh, I'm ready to fuck some shit up now, baby
[Emmage] Ohh, you can come on and fuck me up
Hmm, hmm, triple cheeseburger
[Emmage] Awww, you're just talking about some food
Some fries, and motherfucking couple of Sodas and shit
And.. hot apple turnovers and all the old shit, nigga
(*Yawn*) I'm ready to get my mind on
The Bud smells good than a motherfucker too
I don't want hit no more of that old shit 
That shit is nice to be fucked with
Nice to be fucked with, I'm hiiighh
Ohhh, nigga, you pass that shit to somebody else
Nigga, I'm through for the night
Really though, really though, nigga
Let's go and get some food and get up out this motherfucker
Cause uhh.. no nigga, don't be trying to pass me that shit
Nigga, I told you I'm cool, ohh, maddness!

[Outro: Ruben]
