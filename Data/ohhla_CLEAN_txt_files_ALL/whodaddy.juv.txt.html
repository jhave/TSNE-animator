[Juvenile]
Girl you're lookin' like a '4 dropped low to the ground
Ooh, I like it when you shake it up and swing it around
Don't stop, ooh, you servin' it now
Have a nigga lookin' for you, searchin' around

I tried to pass you up but you're lookin' so hot
Got my dick gettin' stiffer than a robot
You not lookin' concerned about what a hoe got
You just layin' it down right there in yo' spot
When you pass a nigga, come to a slow stop
Wonderin' how I'm lookin' when the clothes drop
Fresh out of the fingernail and toe shop
Lookin' real, I gotta get her when the hoe pop
She got a shape, ain't nothin' fake, she in the race
Her pretty face, I'd give her a 7 or 8
Or maybe 9 if she really fine
Side and behind with a lady mind
Diamonds, she genuine...

[Chorus]
Let your hair down girl, you already know
(When I grab ya ass) I ain't gonna let it go
Ooh, I'm the shit and you the poo poo
Let a nigga fuck you with that uptown voo-doo

You my lil' mamma mia, and you already know
Who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy hoe?
You my lil' mamma mia, and you already know
Who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy hoe?

[Juvenile]
Your big, fine, don't be scared, put your hands up
Give me a minute, you ain't gotta give your man up
In a relationship, I understand, and what?
He ain't focusin' right now, so we CAN fuck
Move - shake - bounce - pop
Pancake it, pull it over at the bus stop
Swing it back around, stop it there and make it wiggle
Put it in reverse and back it up just a little
It ain't your birthday, nope, it ain't your birthday
But I'ma treat you like that, if you can serve me
Girl you a stallion, let me take you to the derby
I bet a hundred that you gon' be up in first place
(Pose - move - stop - walk)
Shit, I think you more finer than the block talk
Ladies, put your hands up if you need to get dropped off
Up even higher if you wanna leave in my car

[Chorus]
Let your hair down girl, you already know
(When I grab ya ass) I ain't gonna let it go
Ooh, I'm the shit and you the poo poo
Let a nigga fuck you with that uptown voo-doo

You my lil' mamma mia, and you already know
Who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy hoe?
You my lil' mamma mia, and you already know
Who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy hoe?...

Uh-hu... uh-hu... uh-hu...

[Juvenile]
Like it when you be dressin' all fancy
And your lips be lookin' like candy
Come here and get you a sip of this Brandy
Let me think a size off of what I can see
You musta been eatin' by grannies
Cause that ass lookin' phat in them panties
Tryin' to treat you like one of my family
And I won't be actin' like your man be
I'm the shit lil' mama, just chance me
Cause you're lookin' at a more advanced me
Now drop it, and pop it, and shake it like a dog
Look back at a gangsta when you're catchin' the wall

[Chorus]
Let your hair down girl, you already know
(When I grab ya ass) I ain't gonna let it go
Ooh, I'm the shit and you the poo poo
Let a nigga fuck you with that uptown voo-doo

You my lil' mamma mia, and you already know
Who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy hoe?
You my lil' mamma mia, and you already know
Who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy hoe?</pre>
