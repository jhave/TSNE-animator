Yo, you ain't driving alone right now yo...
then ride with me... we're in this together...

[Chorus]
If I live long enough
To see my kids grow (I just want to talk to you)
If I'm strong enough
To let my past go (yo, yo I just want to talk to you)
If I live long enough
I beg forgiveness for the game that get me pissed I just want to feed my kids
If I'm strong enough
I keep from doing bids, puff a little herb in the meanwhile and live
If I live long enough
I create some works of art to last for years and end a couple of careers
If I'm strong enough, I'll ignore the finest bitch
If I live long enough to see how real that Chino is

[Verse 1]
Yo
Is it possible for me to succeed?
Without selling my soul, for the wrong price?
Time spinning backwards, my life in turnaround
Am I worth less when I'm not dissing?
I got so much more beneath the surface!
If you would listen you'd become immersed with
Words of one of the most thought-provoking cats you could converse with
Break bread and share a verse with
If we die share a hearse with, it's my 15th anniversary
Of my passion for writing
But you deem perfection in its own right
Or when I'm in the zone tight
Holdin' on with all my might, kneeling clutching rosary beads
Write and inscribe, fighting to keep my manchild inside alive
But I'm...too lost in anger
Trying to harmonize and become one with the moments
That I'm standing in abandoning aborted theories of life
Fury and strife, pestilent landscapes in the deserts of my mind
Trying to find the oasis.....my flow so racist
I don't want to die holding these 4 aces
I'm known in most places (for what?)
For having lyrics that can fill 8007 whole book cases
But still I don't speak!
I hate people more and more each day
But today I hate them like it's next week!
And still I didn't peak, verbally
Kind of like I'm playing hide and seek
Who will be the one to murder me?
I take it back to Jersey, where I'm treated like clergy
Rhyme through a stethoscope in my open heart surgery
I make the sky bleed Burgundy
I'm about to change my name to Earth
because you niggaz think the world of me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
There but for the grace of God go why
My life is a series of multiple-choice questions
How will I die? How can I survive my guilt from B-Wiz death?
My eyes reach streams of fire that's scaring my flesh
I try to make peace with the monster inside
Strive to infinite miles of pain like nature when it's sad
Angels in the path to teach you
The cemetary is the only place where the strong and the weak are truly equal
I walk in honor, watch you get murdered by karma
I'm ill, I'm outstanding in my field like a farmer
Without a father to control my universe
Rappers put me on a pedestal and I dove off head first
I speak for the latin MC's, speak for the thugs
Speak for the single mothers not hanging in clubs
I speak for the fatherless men that's breaking the trend
Even tho some bitch done forced them to be fathers themselves
I speak for the forgotten artists with dreams and talent
But due to record company bureaucracy remain silent
I speak for children on welfare when they are embarrased
I speak for that anger they're feeling plus the pain in their parents
In the name of the pharaohs I speak to you through poisonous arrows
I speak for the black ancestors that's hanging from gallows
Almost decided not to rock again (why?)
Because the only thing I've got in common
with these rappers rhyming is breathing oxygen

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
