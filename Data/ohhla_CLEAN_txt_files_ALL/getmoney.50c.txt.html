I get money, I get money, I get I get I get money (50)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I get money, money I got (I I get it)
I get money, money I got (I I get it)
I get money, money I got (Yeah)
money I got, money I got (I run New York!)
I get money, money I got (I I get it)
I get money, money I got (I I get it)
I get money, money I got (Yeah yeah)
money I got, money I got (I run New York!)

[Verse 1]
I took quarter water sold it in bottles for 2 bucks
And Coca-Cola came and bought it; for billions, what the fuck?
Have a baby by me baby, be a millionaire
I write the check before the baby comes, who the fuck cares
I'm stanky rich, I'ma die tryna spend this shit
Southsides' up in in this bitch
Yeah I smell like the vault, I used to sell dope
I did play the block-now I play on boats
In the south of France baby, St. Tropez
Get a tan, I'm already black, rich, I'm already that
Gangsta, get a gat, hit a head in a hat
Call that a river rat, shit, fuck the chitter chat
The baker, I bake the bread-the barber, I cut your head
The marksman, I spray the led-"Blood clot, chop your leg!"
Do not fuck with the kid
I get biz with the cigg, I come where you live, ya dig?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You can call this my new shit, but it ain't new though
I got rid of my old bitch, now I got new hoes
First it was the Benzo, now I'm in the Enzo
Ferrari, I'm sorry! I keep blowin up! (Oh!!)
They call me the cake man, the strawberry shake man
I spray the AR, make your whole click break dance
Back spin, head spin, flatline, your dead then
9 shells, Mac-10, "Who wan' get it crackin?!"
I was young, I couldn't do good, now I can't do bad
I ride, wreck the new Jag, I just buy the new Jag
Now nigga why you mad? Oh you can't do that?
I'm so forgetful, they callin me cocky
I come up out the jeweler, they callin me Rocky
It's the ice on my neck man, the wrist and my left hand
Bling like bloaw, you like my style
Ha Ha-I'm heading to the bank right now!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, I talk the talk, and I walk the walk
Like a teflon Don, but I run New York
When I come outta court, yea I pop the cork
I keep it gangsta, I have ya outlined in chalk(I-I Get It)
In the hood if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya I'm about my bread(I-I Get It)
Round the world if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya they love the kid (I-I Get It)

(50 Cent)

Whoa Hey
(Yeah, yeah)
Whoa Hey

Whoa
I get money, money I got
(I'm back on the streets man)
I get money, money I got
(I'm bringing the heat man)
I get money, money I got
(I'm on my grind)
money I got, money I got
(Like all the time)
I get money, money I got
(Tryna' stop my shine)
I get money, money I got

Don't get outta line)
money I got, money I got
(I said don't get outta line
I I get it
I I get it
Yeah, yeah)</pre>
