[Chorus: Neo Da Matrix]
They call me Paperman, I get that paper man
Your shorty starin homie, don't make me take her man
But I'm just on the low, and you already know
Yo' bitch choosin Pimpin, that's just the way it go

[Fabolous]
They call me Paperman, Paperman, in that brand new Chevy Sedan
My money stack up so tall, like New York skyscrapers man
I keep me a fresh taper man, Rich Young on the bases man
This player is good at home, like Kobe in Staples man

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
They call me Paperman, Paperman, in that brand new Chevy Sedan
My money stack up so tall, like New York skyscrapers man
I keep me a fresh taper man, Rich Young on the bases man
This player is good at home, like Kobe in Staples man
He be tryin to lock her down, she tryin to escape the man
I pick that paper up in the mornin she is like my paper stand
They say money shapes a man, keep them squares out your circle
And work yo' money nigga just don't let yo' money work you

[Chorus] - 2X

[Fabolous]
I'm a man to blow two grand or so on sneakers made from animal
Even if they don't understand the flow, bet them hoes understand the dough
Every motherfucker on this planet know, money keeps the world on spin
If I put the spur on in, ain't no doubt yo' girl gone grin
They like my shine... they like my grind
I take yo' girl, I bring her back, ain't like she mine
Your hoe's to blame... you know the game
It's 'Loso Rich but if you wanna know the name I say

[Chorus] - 2X

[Fabolous]
Now I dip through strips in a whip
On black 22's and chrome on the lip
Don't slip, don't trip cause the tips are hollow
in this chrome on my hip
I lean so mean, so clean
that there ain't a stain on these clothes
Hoes run don't stunt the ones
We makin it rain on these hoes
I ride through slow, just hide yo' hoe
Don't let yo' girl see 'Loso
I think I'm this, I think I'm that
Man I don't think I know so
I let them know, we let them go
So please don't play wit them boys
She wanna come, just let her come
over and play with them boys

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
