[Lil Wayne]
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try but I'm cursed so never mind
And it's worse but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher, the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryin to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But, soon for a nigga it be on muh'fucker
Cause, all this bullshit done made me strong muh'fucker!
So I

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Pick the world up and I'ma DROP it on yo' fuckin head, yeah
Bitch I'ma pick the world up and I'ma DROP it on yo' fuckin head, yeah
And I could die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth motherfucker
I'm gone.. motherfucker I'm gone

[Lil Wayne]
Uhh, I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside
So I could

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
I'm gone... I'm gone, I'm gone
It hurts but I never show, this pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream fuck 'em all
Man it feels like these walls are closin in, this roof is cavin in
Up it's time to raise it then, your days are numbered like pagers and
My book of rhymes got 'em cookin boy, this crooked mind of mines 
got 'em all shook and scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin clock I took the time
And I, came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up, fuck this fame that ain't what
I came to claim but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'ma make these fuckin haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words so your fuckin heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently bitch it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah prepare to die!
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, incredible, hoe you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin head'll spin dawg
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives
I'll fuckin

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
I'm gone... I'm gone, I'm gone</pre>
