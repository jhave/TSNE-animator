Joker
Bruiser

Yeah
Burn an ounce to this
Bitch I put my house on it
That if I pull my dick out
You gon' put your mouth on it
I know you wanna bounce on it
And look back at me with confidence
But if you don't spend no pounds on it then
We gon' have some consequence

Bitch show me what that mouth do
Spit all on it like "achoo"
That boy Ra like Afu
That bitch nasty like dog food
Pulled up in the old school
But them clothes is all new
Them hoes be like who you
But them white hoes they already knew

Now she all up on my thang
This Alexander ring
A couple grams of cocaine
Now we up in P.F. Chang's
Keep going back to that bathroom
I said snort that shit off the bar
A couple shots of that Cuervo
Now she suckin my dick in the car

Now we chewin' on a pill
'Bout the size of this bitch nipple
And when that wind blow hard
You can hear that asshole whistle
That's the type of bitch I like
That's the kind of ho I love
A blond hair blue-eyed ho
With some dried up blood in her nose

Now I know nothin' 'bout you
But I know a whole lot 'bout me
And one thing's for certain
I ain't paying for that pussy
So if what's in your knees gon' cost me a fee
Call me cheap and give that head up for free

Now give me head for free
Head for free, head for free
Cause you ain't gettin' my money
Give me head for free
Head for free, head for free
Cause you ain't gettin' my money
Give me head for free
Head for free, head for free
Cause you ain't gettin' my money

Style!
Now give me head for free
Head for free
