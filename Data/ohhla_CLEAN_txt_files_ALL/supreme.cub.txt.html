You can feel me, you can feel me

(verse one)  {1:09}
I be the one that you love to hate
I be the one that's from out of state
I be the one with the nickle plate
I be the one with the mean face
I be the one with the bad taste
I be the one that you worry 'bout
I be the one that make ya hurry out
I be the one that make your mama shout
I be the one that's the cleanest (fo' sho')
I be the one with the niggas and guns that's the meanest (let 'em know)

(chorus)  {1:32}
Supreme hustle (uh huh), I got supreme muscle (yep)

Supreme hustle (uh huh), I got supreme muscle (yep)

(verse two)  {1:43}
You be the one that we laugh at (ha ha)
You be the one that can't have that (uh uhn)
You be the one to get your ass cracked (crack!)
You be the one that's takin' live rounds
You be the one thats got to run from them bloodhounds
You be the one with the eight babies
My seven ladies, still dressin' like the eighties
You be the one that just checked in emergency
You be the one thats a die, in need of surgery

(chorus)  {2:06}
Supreme hustle (uh huh), I got supreme muscle (yep)

We be the ones that your woman love
We be the ones that your fellas hug
We be the ones that you jellous of
We be the ones with the big guns
We be the ones with the six-uns
You should get one
We be the ones with the dirty spirits
We be the ones with them bomb ass dirty lyrics
We be the ones that your kids like
We be the ones that make you beat your wife
And hate your life (tell 'em)
