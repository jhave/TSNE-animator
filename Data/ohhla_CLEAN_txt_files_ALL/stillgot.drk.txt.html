[Drake]
I feel good, I got some time off girl it's been so loooong
Did you have fun? Cause I'ma need a cab just to get me hoooome
And maybe you could call in sick
And bring it to the crib and get all this (all this)
I know, I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feelin back?
Well you should know

[Chorus: Drake]
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya {*3X*}
And even though we let it go, it's better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya {*3X*}
And even though we let it go, it's better that you know
I still
