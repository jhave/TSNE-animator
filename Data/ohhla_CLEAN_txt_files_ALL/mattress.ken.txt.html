[Paul Wall]
Yeah, Paul Wall baby
Swishahouse
Jamie Kennedy whattup Stu
Yeah, it's some mattress macks baby
You already know

[Jamie Kennedy]
Yo, I'm the mattress mack
Touched down in H-Town with a glass of 'gnac
I got a glass of sizzurp, pass the lean
Me Stu and Paul Wall on that gasoline
I'm swangin and bangin, comin down in the slab
Still tippin, lookin for a girl's booty to grab
Yeah we parking lot pimpin girls, sit and dey watch
Pop trunk, Getty 4's with invisible tops
I'm throwed, so cold, ice grill in my mouth
Had a dream to be a rapper now I'm livin it out
So we party with the girls, take 'em back to the crib
I'm the mattress mack baby, that's the way that I live

[Chorus 2X: various samples]
M-m-m-mattress mack! (I got a king size mattress that's good for yo' back)
Matress mack! Mattress mack! (I got a king size mattress that's good for yo' back)

[Paul Wall]
Steady posted up, grindin baby, stackin up this bread and cake
Chasin after Benjamin Frank, every dollar that I can make
I'm comin down candy, nuttin but that apple gloss
Flip the switch, weighted trunk, breakin all these suckers off
I'm at the Club Blue, lookin for a freak-a-leek
Gotta be a thick chick to ride in my passenger seat
I got the cup full, J Kennedy passed the lean
Gettin full of that George Bush, Texas oil know what I mean
I'm with my partner Stu, ridin on that candy blue
Tellin these broads what it do, tell your friends to come on through
Holla at my partner Gu', call me Viagra man
Breakin off these girls proper, baby I do all I can
Cause I'm a mattress mack, screens down in my Cadillac
Speakers bumpin, swangin comin down with my trunk cracked
I'm Paul Wall, Swishahouse baby, Houston Tex
Live from the gridiron, I'm on the grind, collectin checks

[Chorus]

[Stu Stone]
Stu Stoooone, Stu Stoooone
It's Stu Stone baby, the last mack remaining
And trust me when I say I ain't a mack in training
Yeah I'm down with Paul Wall, Johnny Dane done grilled me up
I'm in the club with some lean up in my cup
Homeruns in H-Town like my name was Berkman
Trust me it didn't come easy I put in work man
It's workin, the sizzurp'n is got me feeling money
Drink this hurr Crist' and my piss is worth money honey
When you got 4 20's then you ridin on 80's
Call me What It Dew Stu for what I do to the ladies
Swangin and bangin on Richmond, stoppin traffic at Max's
I'm just tryin to pull an actress back to mack's mattress

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, mattress mackin!
'Til the day that I die
H-Town, real fly</pre>
