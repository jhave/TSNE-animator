Ladies in this place go, ladies take your skirts off
Ladies in this place go, ladies take your skirts off
Lady, I tell you bout my baby, hey, hey
I said lady, I tell you bout my baby, hey, hey, yeah
I'm a tell you bout my home girl, everytime I go up she look so good
I know what to do cause he from the hood
I'm a see her at the party and I was good
I'm a hit it from the back a little how I should
Based God fuck my bitch cause I know you could
Based God fuck my hoes cause he nasty
Shout out to no, cause I'm classy
I'm a tell the girl this, I'm a tell her that
I'm a tell her bitch my mama stay facts
I'm a tell her go hold or you gotta go
Pop that pussy on the wall for chris Jericho
Bitch you know me you know that I'm from the hood
Got 56 bitches so you know I'm good
Everyday is Christmas with a bad bitch
Man that girl out the club and I'm smashing

Lady, I tell you bout my baby, hey, hey
I said lady, I tell you bout my baby, hey, hey, yeah

Let me hear you scream ok, ok
Is she ever gonna stop man, no way
Damn you look so good, shake it from the back
Bitch I'm acting like a dog, I know how to act
I'm a gig for my nigga howl in the booth
West side, east side, south side too
In the middle of the full bitch take it off
You fuck the nigga in the club and she lick my balls
Like girl, oh my God, how you gonna do that with no proms
Say it ain't no thang, but it
A round that girl with the belly rang
She got a blue girlfriend named kesha,
But I really start to think that it's lisa
That's what happen when you smoking on the reefer
Start to mixing up the bitches that meet ya

Lady, I tell you bout my baby, hey, hey
I said lady, I tell you bout my baby, hey, hey, yeah</pre>
