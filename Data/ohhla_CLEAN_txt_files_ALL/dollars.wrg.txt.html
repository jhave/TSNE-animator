[Kurupt talking]
Y'all don't know nothin about this HEE-ARE
Hahahahahahaha, yeah! It's Kurupt Young Gotti
Hehaha, sup Warren G? It's my homeboy, huh?
With my niggas Crucial Conflict, huh?
Chillin, huh? Bumpin, puffin on a little bit of that Hay
*TOKE* Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

[Warren G]
Dollars make sense, it's all incorporated
I'ma get it all, since a BG I done did it all, was in it all
When I first thought I was in the wrong
Couple tokes, alcohol
Got everything I need, Hennessey and weed
Since my arrival, based on this modern-day survival
Evrything is technicality, everything based on reality
So how do I get paid, all these licks nowadays
They want me laid, dropped and plagued, AK mouth is sprayed
It's like I'm blind, and I just can't see
Warren G, I'ma holler at the homey Shorty B
"Shorty B IT'S ME!", G Dove, I'm out to make a grip
So call Crucial Conflict and let's make us some bomb shit

[Wildstyle]
Look at me on the M-I-C
Tryin to stack my tips, comin in a big ole ride
With all that bumpin side, livin up in your eyes, surprise
Hangin on the corners where the young brothers be comin up
The gangbangers be gunnin up, the type of brothers that roll with us
High tech with much respect, with all that G's swarmin
Like G-Funk in your eyes and make you see we about that cashflow
Put em in a lasso, don't try to sweat, no joke
We illa your side, in the back we get hot, trade bump and hit em up
With the jigs up, 
freaks from the West to the east to the South where they chief
Kurupt in the mind, Young Gotti down with the raw dog Flict
I ain't no tricks, nigga Wildstyle, enemies get closed down
We rock the shows, slammin do's, Cali to Chi-town

[Coldhard]
So chop it up, I'm gonna kick some shit about what's goin on
Have to get my loot up so I suit up
looked in the mirror said to myself "It's gon' be gone"
I'm sick of goin thru the things that I have to do do
Cops are happy to jack fools, I'm strictly ever gon' gank move
I hate to be the one that have to take it
But you best believe I'd die to make it
anywhere in the world I'm standin with my pockets naked
Set it out set it out, that's what I'ma holler
On some slick, tryin to come up quick, witta trusty ole dollar
Watchin you watchin me, hope I slip and bust my knees
I'ma have to greet you at the pond, you should just be thinkin C's
Comin out at ease, no matter what I'm still hard to please
Flap flappin sky, be real til the day I leave so sneeze

Chorus: Reel Tight

Talin bout that money, dollar
Gettin that money, gettin paid
*repeat x3*

[Never]
We, smackin and stackin, packin, strappin, what's happenin? Rollin
Cruise-controllin, the fo' and Daynes swell up
Get the hell up, trump-tight click just in case I'm lavish
Tryin ta fade me, you crazy ladies, babies created
Men are shady, straight make me drink til my thoughts get swavy
I think, maybe if I blink things will get back gravy
But loccs in the hood they lord be makin it hard so lately
But I gotta stay at the table, cos that raw dope is that will pay me
Westside of California, on these corners pimpin daily
Retire out on the lakefront, smokin blunts
Takin the sale G, trap me like the male be
To the Westside I'm a mental, all the regulators trail me

[Kilo]
Don't kick it out, let's do this
Comin out the do', we down to wall
Gotta get in the business, 
tell me waht's the call, we to the fall to ball
We can't just fold up, 
gotta whole bunch of homies dependin on this, sho'nuff
This only hustle is for brothers,
feel to bring the business so slow up
And we still up on a mini gold rush
Ready to make the world go down
Bound to get it cos I'm down wit it
Now shitty the city, Conflict's causin critics to bite tongues
Ain't the one, with the shotgun, showdown
My town to your town on the rebound for them papers

[Warren G]
It's like brother brother brother how you make em get down?
From the LBC to the Chi-town, Westside straight gettin down
Hittin switches and we checkin all snitches
Gettin all riches, and flossin in our pictures
It's time for some new hits, one of us
You know I spit some coast to coast love from your homey G Dove
