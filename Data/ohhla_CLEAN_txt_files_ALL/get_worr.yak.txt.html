[2Pac]
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggaz are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, we Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes
Let the punks know

[Verse 1: Yaki Kadafi]
Guess it's this felonies hobby
That got me here thinking robbery
Day to day all year long
Teflon protects my body
It's such unimportant in this criminal cartel
I'm caught in
Supportin' me
So in these streets of hockey
I play the goalie
Secrets to war licks, and score shit shared
Between clients and homies
Remember what Pacino told me
Before he past
Watch them clowns with them crocodile smiles
Cause they phoney
I get that cash, stay lonely
And I'm on point like a thorn
And it's survival of the strong
Livin' outside the laws of this crooked world
I was born touched

[Chorus: 2Pac](x2)
Young niggaz in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still livin child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggaz better slow down
Cause you can be touched

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
I'm on a twelve o'clock cruise to Brooklyn
And I'm lookin' for the third
Let's see no barrel ready to get his life tookin
So where yo killas at and fetti
Trick don't test me to leave yo coward ass stripped
And a full clip empty in yo stomach
Choosin all
Yeah nigga runnin'
Poppin' all you cowards that be jockin' a nigga behind you
You done just about made it on impossible to escape
Another emergency visit to the hospital
I can't wait to meet up with all you bitches in the streets
So I can leave all you cowards bleedin in yo fuckin'seats
When we hit 'em up

[Chorus: 2Pac](x2)
Young niggaz in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still livin child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggaz better slow down
Cause you can be touched

[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]
I bring the lingo to the click
Tasty like a Pringle
Sneakin through your chimney like Kris Kringle
On some shit
Get me free to let my ice click
Ka-pling, ka-plow
I been a thug shootin slugs since a child
And still wild

[2Pac]
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggaz are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, we Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes</pre>
