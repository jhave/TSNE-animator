[Intro]
Check it out
I want you to feel me baby
I want you to understand me baby
This is it yo, no bullshit
No jokes, no games
This is it yo, fo real
I see it happenin' man
It's about to go down
For all of us (fo real)
I see you swinging, I see you noddin' to it
It's about to go down for us, word up man
We almost home
We almost at the finish line nigga
It feel good, don't it? Oh!
And it's ova!
I can go home and chill
(Feel it, yo)

[Verse 1]
It's a long process from bar 1 to bar 16 and
Writin in my notebook from morn' to evenin
But my fam still not believin' - in my bed late
At night with my eyes closed often dreamin'
And zoned out I'm goin' out fuck it I'm home now
Arrestin' the rhythm I'm a rolling stone now
Making my own way from stone cold days and long nights
But who could feel my sacrifice
Cause they ain't half as nice and couldnt' understand
How I feel when I'm on the track board turnin the knob switch
Moms keep talking that old "get a real job" shit
And that's the kind of thinking Phonte got a prob with
Solved it - my blood fam on the bandwagon
Can't believe the man put his plan into action
They rather that I choose a different plan for my passion
Couldn't understand I demand satisfaction

[Hook]
They say you might be crazy
and sometimes I agree
You and I know that's not all that you are

They say you might be crazy
? baby
You and I know that's not all that you are

[Verse 2]
Yo, it's a new day it's time to see
I got a seed, Amaya, the love of my life
Best believe, plus I still got love for me
I'm doin this for her and me, take mics and make currency
Steady worryin' yo, I wish I had a clone of me
Man this ain't the way it supposed to be
My daughter's mom wishin she was close to me
Holdin' me, instead she's lonely - and loathing
Complaining that her life's competin' with mine
Cause I be out of the house for weeks at a time
And she be stuck at home playing housewifey with an attitude
Before we had a kid, we should've had a clue
I fell asleep with this beat on repeat
Repetitively, life seems to grip me
I'm trying to be a better man, please believe me
Ready and god willin if you ready to teach me

[Hook]
They say you might be crazy
and sometimes I agree
You and I know that's not all that you are

They say you might be crazy
?
You and I know that's not all that you are

[4 bar bridge]
(Real talk, yo)

[Verse 3]
Everybody gotta way to try to be the man
Some write rhymes others move kilograms
You ain't tryna play yourself with me neither man
Because I was dealt I can play 'em with either hand (c'mon)
I gotta be the plan, put it in motion
A nigga on the grind I'm proceedin with focus
I know that makin my moves ain't a part of your plans
But understand that that ain't all that I am
I was lost in the ?
Got a call from a man with a studio he bought with a grand
Feel like destiny was in the palm of his hand
Real shit we can all understand (check it out yo)

[Hook]
They say you might be crazy
and sometimes I agree
You and I know that's not all that you are

They say you might be crazy
?
You and I know that's not all that you are</pre>
