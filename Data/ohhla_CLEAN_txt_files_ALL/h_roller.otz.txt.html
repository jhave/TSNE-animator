[Joell Ortiz]
I'm talking to you!
Don't look to your left and right
Yeah, you
Oh now you shook, tryna get low
You scared

Come out, come out, wherever you are
Don't hide now, I see you at the end of the bar
Looking all pretty, got your friends around
Got your hands on some gwap, now you sending rounds
Can't nobody tell you nothing cause you know you hot
and you say they hating when they say "No you not"
Cause they mad how you be looking in them clothes you rock
Or they don't like how you walk in and others hoes just clock
But if you ask me, you're a bit conceded
You shouldn't be in that magazine, you should read it
and learn a little something from someone that really matters
I laugh at y'all so hard I got to pee, it hurts my bladder
You're hot now, but blink, abracadabra
You disappear from everyone's mind like "Who that was?"
So make investments with that little change you gather
cause in a second there'll be no more room for you HOE RAPPERS!

Yes, you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Looking all around and tryna dip and get low
I'm talking to you pal, jerk</pre>
