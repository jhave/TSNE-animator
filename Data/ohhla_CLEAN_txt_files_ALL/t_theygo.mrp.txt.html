Album:  Ghetto Bill
Song:   There They Go
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: Master P - repeat 2X]
Where them thugs at - there they go
Where them thug girls at - there they go
Where them ballers at - there they go
If you came to get buck then throw yo' hood up

[Drumma Boy]
I pull up at the club, drinkin and I'm gettin loose
I'm V.I.P. I ain't thinkin how I'm gettin through
I'm chillin with P and I'm actin the fool
When your girl see the Tank then I'm snatchin your boo
I'm in the 'llac, Halleluyah in the Coupe
My dawgs in the back with the gats and the food
Yeah - it's young Drumma, straight from the slums of
where niggaz shine to stay on the come up
Niggaz jealous from the ice on my neck
Don't be alarmed nigga cause I'm nice with the tec
Shorty lookin right in her dress
When I took her home, skipped talk, right into sex
Yep!  I'm the truth, you the other man
You think you're hot but I'll prove you're like an oven fan
I got them broads sayin dude so wicked
Straight from the South man, New No Limit, yeah

[Chorus]

[Master P]
You can find us on the block with that rock boy
I'm a New No Limit Soldier, not a hot boy
Put my name on the ward, I'm a legend like Hook
Posted up on the block with the killers and crooks
Ghetto Bill could never be no stunna nigga
What I got, cars for the winter and summer nigga
You don't know me keep my name out your motherfuckin mouth
'fore I send some fuckin killers to yo' house
And the game get real, so niggaz pack steel
When some shit pop off you better get it how you live
From the city, where we don't give a fuck about snitches
We in the club V.I.P. finger fuckin some bitches
So where them ballers at, shot callers at
I'm like Warren G shorty, gimme alla dat
Before I leave baby girl, you could slip me the digits
And later on you could play with the lizard, you heard me?

[Chorus]</pre>
