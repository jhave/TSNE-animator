You better be careful where you go 
Be careful where you go 
Be careful where you go 
Be careful where you go 
Ahh, you'll never or you'll never grow 
You better be careful where you go 
The army's on way 
Ahh, you'll never or you'll never grow 
The army's on way 
How does it feel that way, feel that way, the army's on way 
How does it feel that way, feel that way, the army's on way 
Ahh, you'll never or you'll never grow 

(Bizzy) 
You better be careful where you go 
What am I supposed to do? 
What? Telling me ya'll feeling me 
Been livin' up in a material world 
Ya'll killing me, ya'll killing me 
Really, really, act so silly 
Til he hit 'em in the middle of the kidneys 
And he fall, all over a sin 
Letting it feel that way, feel that way 
Get yourself killed that way 
Victorious-ous-ous-ous 
And put him in cuffs, fucked him up, up, up, up 
And wake up, wake up, wake up 
By the caffeine and green and nicotine and a Ute Ferrari, aye
Come around our way (yeah) 
You always wanna party 
You gotta handle your business 
Can I get a witness? 
Mmm hmm, what part of the game is this? 
If we were in the islands, I would fry your whole tribe 
Sicilian style while add enough break wide 
As I come back with the vibe 
And I throw up near side 
Grimy niggas I can feel ya 
I've been here the whole time 

(Chorus) 
The army's on way 
The army's on way 
Ahh, you'll never grow 
The army's on way 
The army's on way 
Ahh, you'll never grow, you'll never grow 
The army's on way 
Ahh, you'll never grow 
Ahh, you'll never grow 
The army's on way 
Ahh, you'll never grow 
Ahh, you'll never grow 

(Bizzy) 
Where your friends ain't your friends 
And your foes ain't your foes 
Where these niggas turning us bitches 
And these bitches turn into hoes 
Where the women at? 
Baby I'ma getcha back, getcha back 
Sit cha back, lick ya back, split ya back, picture that 
If you don't know my story that's a more the reason to get the seasons 
I'm stressed but I'm still breathing 
Cleveland, the city we come from redrum 
And murda mo I can feel some 
Dumb idiots, hideous, fiesty, insideous 
Some say I'm the prettiest thing 
No need me rapping? 
Fuck that! 
Wind up just like a muskrat 
Hut one! Hut two! And bust back! 
Cuz that's just how we do in fact 
How do I feel me? 
Fuck that touch molest two 
And what's that little lesion on me? 
Jesus, why did I do that? 

(x2) 
You better be careful where you go 
What am I supposed to do? 
You better be careful what you do 
What am I supposed to do? 
You better be careful who you use 
What am I supposed to do? 
You better be careful who you choose 
What am I supposed to do? 

(Chorus)x4 
Ahh, you'll never grow! 
The army's on way 

(Bizzy) 
See, we can ride and fuck a cop 
Oh no, let's walk and fuck 'em all 
We can pull out all our guns 
Or we can talk and help the cause 
Silent weapons watch your step, step 
Squad hit your set yet? 
Ain't nobody snitching 
But I see one of your niggas is itching 
Soon as pinched 'em I connect he gonna tell 'em 
I'm gonna tell you, you gon' get that ass wet, wet, wet 
We talking about non-profit organizations 
Travel with the Lord all over the nation 
Unmasked situ-, love and trust have some patience 
Keep the faith 
Even if Satan is face to face then keep hittin 
Remember Joe before value of gold broke, but I know 
Whatever you facing keep on chasing, chasing 
Can't runaway you gotta face 'em, erase 'em 
Get to the finish get to the spinach, and keep blazing 

You better be careful where you go 
You better be careful what you do 
You better be careful who you choose 
You better be careful who you use 
What am I supposed to do? 
What am I supposed to do? 
What am I supposed to do? 
What am I supposed to do? 

(Chorus til fade) 
Ahh, you'll never grow 
Ahh,you'll never grow 
The army's on way 
You'll never grow 
Ahh,you'll never grow </pre>
