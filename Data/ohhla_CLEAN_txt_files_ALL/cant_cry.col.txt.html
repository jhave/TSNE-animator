Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Need y'all niggaz to feel me yo
Feel my pain..
Said soft niggaz can't last hard times yo
Believe that shit
Real niggaz don't cry..
Look
Yo..

Was just a youngin' with that fresh fade
Bird chest, legs skinny
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny
Fresh pennies on my feet
Momma paid for everything I'm wearing
At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world
Aw. nigga, but shit done changed since "Mayne" was my nickname
A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game
Now I'm a man worried about my fam'
Let me explain
Its like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shits sprained
And so I rap for my niggaz trapped in the struggle
Feeling like the world's on your back so you stumble
And it feels like a quarterback get sacked, and then you fumble
Jobs don't call a nigga back so it's back to the hustle
Niggaz praying for they moms
At the same time they moms pray for them
Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way
But damn a nigga been a lost fate
It hurts on the usual
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no

I sit back and watch the news every now and then
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash
Even the weathers bad
It be the same shit, got my brain twisted
Like damn it's '06 and niggaz still up on that gang shit?
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split
Only seventeen, he was finna graduate in like three weeks
some stupid niggaz got him for his chain
But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped
Some dude snatched her and she was standing at the bus stop, wait
man she just eleven!
What the fuck is up with this world
got these grown niggaz fucking with girls?
Plus the cops harassing us
every week be blasting us, on accident, or so they claim
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain
They killed her only son
Make her wanna blow her brains out
Change the channel man I can't watch this shit..

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no

Take a ride through the city man and tell me what you witness
Poverty, richness, crooked cops and misfits
violence, hatred, real devastation
neighborhoods looking like there's still segregation
welfare, single mothers, no jobs
tryna get a piece for yourself, but they hogging up the whole pie
fiegns in the street so high off of that crack shit
this nigga thirteen with a gat under his mattress..
White folks got the road to success mapped and that's all good
but why don't black's got that same atlas?
I asked the same question a million ways
and it seems like I had prayed for a million days
Still the ills remain - just bills and pain
Shoot outs and project buildings, children slain
skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why
Its enough to make a nigga wanna cry
but I can't though..

Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no</pre>
