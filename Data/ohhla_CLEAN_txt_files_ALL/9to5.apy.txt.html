Typed by: kamerj@hotmail.com

[Chorus] 2X

[Lady voice Sample]
I kept tellin' myself...

[Jay-Z sample]
9 to 5 is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it alive

[Emilio Lopez]
Picture Emilio plotting cashing checks
Living life is a square taking average thefts
I can't see that, multibillionaire, I wanna be that
Fooling bitches on the beach, tell me where the weed at
Never liked school, college, I don't wanna do that
Some niggers told me I was nice thinkin that I do raps
Still live amongst fiends, so I might move that
Swallow pride 9 to 5, I ain't going through to that

[Apathy]
It's something about knowing my mother is still working
And it's certain that her back hurting, and it'll probably worsen
That lengthens my hustle, strengthens my struggle
Stacking up dough until the banks are in trouble
So call me a capitalist, consider us savages
Cause we rob and kill and live lives lavishness
Broke mind state only get me mad
I rather be a sugar daddy than a deadbeat dad

[Chorus]

[Apathy and Emilio together]
No matter how hard it gets I won't stop 'til I'm gettin it

[Lady voice Sample]
I kept tellin' myself...

[Jay-Z sample]
9 to 5 is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it alive

[Apathy and Emilio together]
No matter how hard it gets I won't stop 'til I'm livin it

[Lady voice Sample]
I kept tellin' myself...

[Jay-Z sample]
9 to 5 is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it alive

[Emilio Lopez]
Check this, gotta have dough to pull a bad bitch
Some cats swish, others throw a fast pitch
Motherfuckers like me, just prefer a fast flip
Life get bigger, the bigger the cash get

[Apathy]
Cash get, motherfuckers in trouble like asbest
Past depths, put expensive suits in caskets
Cause some cats get gats and blow their ?????
When it comes to getting money, study all the aspects

[Emilio Lopez]
Assets liabilities, gotta get business wise
Labels wanna jerk us, dont get victimized
Records gotta sell so the raps gets simplified
But I do what I gotta, as long as the chips are high

[Apathy]
I know better but I want the nice whips and buy
Mansion enhanced with wifey and the kids inside
MTV would think the crib is too big and wide
I strive to be rich, always throw some chips aside

[Chorus]

[Apathy and Emilio together]
No matter how hard it gets I won't stop 'til I'm gettin it

[Lady voice Sample]
I kept tellin' myself...

[Jay-Z sample]
9 to 5 is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it alive

[Apathy and Emilio together]
No matter how hard it gets I won't stop 'til I'm livin it

[Lady voice Sample]
I kept tellin' myself...

[Jay-Z sample]
9 to 5 is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it alive

[Bridge]4X (Apathy and Emilo Lopez)
Cause when the money comes slow
Life moves slow
When the cash comes fast
Put your troubles in the past

[Apathy]
I used to never really sweat it, now wifey got me fixing my credit
Cause in the long run, you live to regret it

[Emilio Lopez]
Then you bank is pathetic, your schedule is hectic
And 9 to 5 is always the state of being perfected

[Apathy]
As a child we were living off government cheese

[Emilio Lopez]
As a teen I was living off hustlin trees

[Apathy]
Nowadays being broke is a fucking disease
[Emilio Lopez]
So I stay clutching them G'z
[Apathy]
And brushing my sleeves

[Chorus]

[Apathy and Emilio together]
No matter how hard it gets I won't stop 'til I'm gettin it

[Lady voice Sample]
I kept tellin' myself...

[Jay-Z sample]
9 to 5 is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it alive

[Apathy and Emilio together]
No matter how hard it gets I won't stop 'til I'm livin it

[Lady voice Sample]
I kept tellin' myself...

[Jay-Z sample]
9 to 5 is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it alive</pre>
