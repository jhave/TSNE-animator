[Intro/Chorus: Drake]
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I'm at home, yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feelin faded, well me too
The smoke is gettin blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they ain't gettin money like we do
So it's on, I was lookin for the one
Now I'm feelin dumb for thinkin it was you
I was wrong, now I'm back up in this bitch goin harder than I did
Watch me do it, and I'ma do it all
Feelin like the old me, you don't even know me
I'ma do it all, I'ma do it all
It's probably why I'm back up in this bitch goin harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Drake]
Tonight I'm into breakin up, somebody's home
I'm drunk as ever, I'm not alone
I-I-I-I'm with my people, I know you love it
I don't just do it, I over-does it
I been gettin money so long it's just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce, when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair and Pinot Grigio baby forget about it
I'm headed wherever this motherfuckin jet is routed
You can't have my heart, the doctor told me I'd be dead without it
My judgment's never clouded
That's why I'm steady yellin weatherman weatherman, I'm 'bout whatever man
I'm tryin to fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland
But I'm polite about it, baby after you
I've had a glass or two so

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Tryin to get the green like I'm waitin at a long light
Broke just doesn't suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where'd I put my bowtie? Millionaire, multi
Rest in peace to B.I.G. and praises to the most high
Gettin stupid paid, off of smart decisions
I'm the man now, I guess that part's a given
Someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask what's up and they just always say "The cost of livin"
I learn from it though, I been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light yo' spot up
And me fallin and landin in love I don't think should happen
because everything's easier to get into then get out of
But someone show me to the owner of this city
cause the owner's always seem to be the only people with me
I'm still the mafia, still run the committee
N.Y. forever nigga Diddy, uh

[Chorus]</pre>
