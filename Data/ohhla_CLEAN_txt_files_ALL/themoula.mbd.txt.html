[Havoc]
Yea I want you baby, I'm glad you here
I'ma take good care of you, I'm gonna put you right there
I ain't letting' you go this time, nah you gonna stay right here
I'ma call you money baby, money

[Verse - Havoc]
It started bout 7 when I realized ya worth
Sold drugs to put you all alone with this purse
Took a backseat, cause family came first
Holes in my sneakers and shirt
I turned 13, now lil' niggaz sellin' coke
50 4 1l's yea I copped 'em for them hoes
But you left without warning, I guess it was a lesson
I had you but you showed me no affection
Got withdrawals, took you to the malls
The more I got of you, the more I got spoiled
Now my toes curl, lets have a baby boy or girl
Had you in Switzerland, half across the world
Grew up an investment and you can't be doubled
Came back around when I bubbled
Now I'm in trouble, took the wrong turn
Let my homie borrow you, now he wont pick up his phone

Where you goin' baby where you goin'
Talk about money this is money baby where you goin'
I can hold you baby I can hold you let me hold you

[Chorus - Prodigy - 2X]
The thing about you is you make me smile
You build me up when I go down, you give me strength, you give me power
May no one come between this thing of ours

[Verse - Prodigy]
You give me sex, you give me gifts
You give me head from every baddest bitch
You make me happy you make me sick
Cause baby you my drug and I need my fix
If I ain't have you how would I live
To get you I'd risk that time in prison
To get you I'd take risks that'd mean death
I'ma love you until the end
Its all about you my precious,
I'd never ignore you for a bitch again
I'd put that on my honest,
Got these other nigga jealous cause you all over me
In public, you be all inside my jeans
Took me all over the planet, places like Europe
Taught me new tricks at them banks out in ???
These niggaz, back in the hood
Could never have you like how I do

[Chorus - Prodigy - 2X]
The thing about you is you make me smile
You build me up when I go down, you give me strength, you give me power
May no one come between this thing of ours

I need you, I need you in my life
stay right here with us
Ain't nothin' over there for you
stay right here with us you in good hands right here</pre>
