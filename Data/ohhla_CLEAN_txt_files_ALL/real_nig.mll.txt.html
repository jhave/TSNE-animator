Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro:]
Yea, see real niggas come first cuz we made to respect and we do what we want in these streets
And dope boys come second cuz money make the motherfucking world go round
And fly niggas come third cuz he might aint got no money but he still could pull the baddest bitch in the building
Killin these streets nigga
Treat the motherfucking ghost like a grand marquis
Walk up the leash, 20 deep and we order a feast

[Verse 1:]
I come straight from the ghetto, Im ballin hard as I wanna
And Im thankful as ever, that we aint out on a coma
There been death in system, hear the ref with the whistle
Cuz these suckers is fowl, they disrespect us, we hit em
Niggas claiming they real, they wrist and neck game aint official
They got me out in the field, a nigga back on his grizzle
Going hard with the hammers, my niggas all in the slammer
Niggas want catch me slippin but I dont walk in banana
Im outchea strapper than velcro and no I dont sell dough
But I spit that raw shit, its like I sell coke
Put one in your hand nigga, like right where the shell go
Got one in a chamber yea we on point like your elbow
Bulletproof range when I pull and shoot things
Hit em close range, let em feel the blue flame
Every month I buy a new car, a new chain
And I dont never fuck no bummy hoes then count the loose change

[Hook:]
Real nigga come first (first) and dope boy come second (second)
Fly nigga come third and I keep birds all in my words (in my words)
I keep birds all in my words (and them people tapping my line man that shit bad for my nerves)
Real bitches come first (first), fat bitches come second (second)
Freak bitches come third and I keep birds all in my words
I got purchase all in my system and apple juice in my syrup
And these suckas talkin this money shit, yall niggas got some nerve

[Verse 2:]
I try to keep my bitches all on lay away (lay away)
And if you fuck me good you getting paid today (paid today)
Thats 40 on my wrist, you caught me 80k
And I aint got no ice in it, rollin out the light tinted
So these niggas see me (see me), sway em like graffiti (fiti)
I get what I wanna (wanna), like I own a genie (genie)
Niggas hatin on me (on me)
Know they wanna pin me at the table with my niggas, he is locked in with linguine
And that pussy smell like Fiji
Boy, I just go swimming
Everything but foreign from the porches to the women
Up early in the morning, with the coca, tryna flip it
Nigas say they want the money but they dont want go and get it
Thats why real nigga come first (first), dope boy come second (second)
Fly nigga come third and I was out there on that curb
With that mailbox so in close with me, Im picture red that Im worth
Talkin late nights you dont play right, that kitchen wearin that work
Go!

[Hook:]
Real nigga come first (first) and dope boy come second (second)
Fly nigga come third and I keep birds all in my words (in my words)
I keep birds all in my words (and them people tapping my line man that shit bad for my nerves)
Real bitches come first (first), fat bitches come second (second)
Freak bitches come third and I keep birds all in my words
I got purchase all in my system and half a juice in syrup
And these suckas talkin this money shit, yall niggas got some nerve</pre>
