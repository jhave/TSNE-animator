Comin crunker than your average
Makes you wanna grab it
Cause you gotta have it
See Dawg Child will make it very spiced and Tasty
You really cant help but to move your body crazy
You feelin suntin and I know you jus cant help it
And I know what you're relievin

[Hook: Lloyd]
Thats why
You'll never ever meet anotha playa
As fly
Thats the one with the dubbs on slant
Thats right
So pretty mama please dont let your chance

Starin so hard I didnt even see the
Stop sign
Hit the ground so hard made me
Realize

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Once you get to know me
You will put me
Your in a trance baby
Promise that you aint know no one like me
That puts you in a trance like me
You keep on wantin more and more to please me
