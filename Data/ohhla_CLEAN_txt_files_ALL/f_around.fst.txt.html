"Don't let your baby catch you foolin' around
You just might lose the best thing that you ever found"

[Intro] [Rhymefest talking]
Aight we cool. Myspace, nuhuh. Facebook? Haha. Black Planet?
Oh no! You know what you know what? I lost one or two of 'em
Catch you foolin' around. Look look look look look look look, now now...

[Verse One] [Rhymefest]
Now I was blessed with a brain and a dick that's fine
I only got enough blood to use one at a time
If you into givin' head, we'll be usin' our mind
But my girl get home at six we can't be losin' the time
All men cheat
Don't act like it's a new thang
I got numbers and try to disguise them in dude's names
Like Anthony/Angie, Timothy/Tammy
I be back I'm goin' to see my homie "Pat" up in Miami (bye!)
Get back from Miami
My girl got a jammie
"What the hell is these cause they ain't Timothy's panties!"
I'm like, "I-I bought 'em for you." 
Lies I got caught in a few
I got a girl and fuck as often as you
All men cheat
Hit strip clubs, trick dubs (make it rain!)
Lap dances and dick rubs, forget love
Once or twice tricked the rent off
Showers two in the morning
You ain't gettin' clean
You washin' the scent off
 
[Dres speaking]
Listen. This is Dres. And I'm tryin' to let you know seriously
You like your flavor of the month. You gotta lick it correctly
I myself, I done licked all kind of flavors
I mean, otherwise it's just gonna run down your fingers
And uh, you know what that's called? A mess

[Verse Two] [Rhymefest]
You said your man got you candies and flowers last weekend?
(Awww, he's so sweet!)
No, THAT nigga cheatin'
No wonder he be comin' home, smilin' and cheesin'
You should fuck me now, he gave you a reason
Don't leave him
Or try to key up his van
On the real baby girl, he's just bein' a man
What? You want you a faithful compan-ion?
Well you should run and get a dog cause all men are hogs
And we gonna say whatever it take to get in them drawers
If you don't cheat you must be gayer than the Kids In The Hall (HEY!)
How the hell you expect me to survive
Look at how fine them girls is, half naked down on Lake Shore Drive
And you want me to stay in line when
They playin' Clipse in the club and all the girls get up and start +Grindin+
Jewelry on my neck, swingin' and shinin'
If you got a tape deck homie, start rewindin'</pre>
