Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Come here, I'm 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a lil' gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one I desire

Come here, I'm 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a lil' gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one..

Hey uh, what up girl tell me how you feelin'?
You look sweet enough to make a nigga need a fillin'
If you got a man, do that nigga need a fill in'
She said, looks kill and I'm tryna make a... killin'
God willin' I be chilling on a boat nigga
Love is a gamble, I ain't dealin' with no broke nigga
Down in Miami with a super whole team
Tryna bag a brother with a Super Bowl ring
Oh she, down in Dallas at the all-star game spittin' all-star game
Tryna get a nigga with a all-star name
Somethin' like James, somethin' like Wade
If you something like K you can fuck tonight
Yea she said, fuck some nice Jay's
What about you're life savings?
Won't spend her life slavin'
So she graduated rich nigga wife train
And if you got money; man the head is amazing

Come here, I'm 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a lil' gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one I desire

Come here, I'm 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a lil' gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one I desire

What up girl, tell me how you been?
Ain't seen ya since the 12th grade, even back then
Thought you was a cutie though yer booty mad thin
But you done got thick on a nigga- GOT DAMN
Hey now I got a thang for you
It's been a long time comin' I should hang with you
Cause see way back I thought to fuck with you was impossible
Count your baby daddy's, now 2 ain't impossible, uh
You still got it though, yea you still got it though
Girl your body lookin like a fuckin' pot of gold
You got your mean lil' walk with the model pose
You got your hair did, you got designer clothes
You still got it though, yea you still got it though
You got your nails did, damn girl you're on a roll
Do you give brains? Did you make the honor roll?
Don't worry bout your man baby he ain't gotta know

Come here, I'm 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a lil' gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one I desire

Come here, I'm 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a lil' gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one I desire

I get so bored so fast that they won't last
But girl you're special like I met ya in a slow class
Cause yo ass got me feinin' for you so far
My life is like a movie would you be my co star, like Halle Berry
You're old nigga act like a bitch like Tyler Perry
You caught him down in Memphis cheating like Kale Perry
I see you like to stay up on your ESPN
If your mind is on sex, you must got ESP then
Had a crush on way back, I wasn't VIP then
But I was plottin on you
I really wished that I had got to know you
Before we grew up &amp; I blew up with these Benjamines
That way I know for sure, you're love is really genuine
Is you my homie go show me what kind of friend you is
What if it's phony and only cause I could give you ends
Too late for turnin' back fuck it we continuing
Get your ass in that position I love to bend you in

Come here, I'm 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a lil' gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one I desire

Come here, I'm 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a lil' gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one I desire</pre>
