[Bomshot]
one-two one-two
Yo, check it
Bomshot, yeah, Jus Allah, Shabazz the discple

[Verse 1: Bomshot]
We Recline on thrones
Rap the self-growns(?)resiting poems carved in stone
Unrole the ancient scrolls
Translate the words of Allah, so you can hear them
And thrive down the narrowest path, to be near 'em
I place the seven lamps
Upon the seven miles cause the EARTH to comforth(?) from the North, producin violence
Sacred like a virgin wield in white cloths
The wise are attracted to the light like moths
If all the trees repent and the ocean fills with ink
You still couldn't write the amount of rhymes I think
My words form rivers for vessels to float on, strong enough to hold on
More rhymes than the Qu'Ran
Accurate Arabic, the angel starts to sing
Glory be to the new-born king
Hollow be thou name demons follow a flame
I talk to the dead and continue to heal the lame

[chorus: Shabazz the Disciple] x2
Take a look through the eyes of a disciple
Walk inside of my footprints in the sand understand the lessons of the bible
It's been long suffering since my arrival
Let my life struggle and what I accomplished be the compass for your survival

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
My name erase everything your brain pretains
The date's the same, nothing but the fates have changed
The strength is drained you feel faint indescribable pain
Like a needle full of paint in your veins
Wishing you hell, get sick, never get well
Knock the motherfuckers out, the sound of a bell
While Allah keeps smoking like an ounce per L
Maybe more, I never keep count to tell
I'm Allah's best, you motherfuckers eat hog flesh
That explains the savage ways and the dog breath
King of all things, big and small
The Islam I control with the motherfucking chips fall

[chorus: Shabazz the Disciple]
Take a look through the eyes of a disciple
Walk inside of my footprints in the sand understand the lessons of the bible
It's been Long suffering since my arrival
Let my life struggle and what I accomplished be the compass for your survival

[Verse 3: Shabazz the disciple]
I'm like the one crucified with the thieves
In this land where men are persecuted for what he believes
So gather away, from the sinking ship, or face the pentaly
Change the way you be thinking man cause y'all ya enemies
Control the population with drugs and deseases
Got my people acting evil strung out with needles waiting for jesus
What's made in the image of god?
Who turns savage is get murdered by the government gang with silverbadges
The mob ??? for Juliani
MC you hang slang your bang bang like punani
Word to old spirits above me
One day y'all motherfuckers gonna pay be cause Allah don't like ugly

[chorus: Shabazz the Disciple] x2
Take a look through the eyes of a disciple
Walk inside of my footprints in the sand understand the lessons of the bible
It's been long suffering since my arrival
Let my life struggle and what I accomplished be the compass for your survival</pre>
