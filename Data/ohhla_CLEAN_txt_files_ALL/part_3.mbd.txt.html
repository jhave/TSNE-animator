[Magic]
Now this supposed to be a party right
No Limit Soldier's reputation's gettin rowdy right
You heard the stories, Mo B. Dick turn up the fight ma naga
And when we leave I bet ya whole bunch of thugs follow
Believe that

Now where my downtown peoples at? (Here we go, here we go)
And where my uptown peoples at? (Here we go, here we go)
And where my eastcoast peoples at? (Here we go, here we go)
And where my westcoast peoples at? (Here we go, here we go)
Let's get rowdy nigga.

[Mo B. Dick]
It's really going down
Time to represent my round
Got calio that water town
If you can't swim you bound to drown
Gotta get it off my chest
Say what's up to the midwest
Witchita, Chicago, St. Loius and all the rest
What about them soldiers, No Limit Soldiers
Like Master P and Silkk, Mia-X and C-Murder
Ya'll better recognize the tank doggs is on the rise
Read the source and defie
Billboard, we bout it bout it

[Mo B. Dick-Chorus]
Bout it bout it
Rowdy rowdy x2

[Mo B. Dick]
We doing everythang, videos to picture shows
Design the clothes and panty hose
Sport agencies for professionals
We total loss, Lexuses and all the stars
Escallades is just a part
Living like a superstar
But still we keep it real
And all my homies know the deal
Wasn't easy getting here
We had to work and persevere
I said all I had to say
No Limit's here to stay
Don't even think about stepping in our way
Cuz we...

Chorus x2

[Mia X]
Now who wants to start it
And be the next dearly departed
Cuz when you war with gorillas like us, you gettin' ripped up
Lyricly or in the streets we come out, been bout it
We the first to make you shout it
I'm proud it, ride the tank up your block doing damage
Bank account on swoll, we roll like the ghetto, clapiss and manage
To make it happen even if we all deceased
Gotta problem, put a price on your fate, are you weak
Believe me when I say it's going down
Red light then kaplow, Part 3

[C-Murder]
Part 3, I been bout it, been rowdy, now how you feel
It's ninety nine and No Limit still coming real
Bossalinie, Mia X down with Mo B. D
For the radio straight from the studio
Can you feel a vibe coming straight to ya brain
And much love to the club cause we runnin' things
Now get pumped, and get crunked, while we get ya drunk
Cuz No Limit have a party pumping like a trunk

[Mo B. Dick]
