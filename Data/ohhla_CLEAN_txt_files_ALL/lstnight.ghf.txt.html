[Intro: Ghostface Killah (samples)]
*phone rings 6 times*
Yeah... I don't know, that bitch bugged out and shit
She fuckin' other niggaz
("Hello?", "Hey!") Hey ("Who was you up last night?")

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, she didn't pick up, guess she was gettin' her clit ate up
I let it ring a whole bunch of times, before I hung up
Now mind you, I just got finished diggin' her out
With my boxers on, and I had my joint in her mouth
Gaggin' and shit, lookin' down at the bitch, laughin'
I'm about to smash that pussy like baby Aspirins
I'm fuckin' her, like I had feelings for the bitch
I caught feelings for the bitch, fuck in Pretty Tone's whip
If I wasn't whipped, why I keep givin' up my dick
Like it's voodoo on the kid, I keep suckin' on her clit
From the bed to the bathroom, Toney dickin' her down
Sweatin' bullets like we in the ring, goin' some rounds
Miss Lucy, eatin' sushi, playin' with her cucci
On some Lil' Kim shit, tattoo right up on her booty
That said "Bet you five beans, you can't even move me"
Know how to work the pussy muscles when your dick is in that cootie
That's right, yeah her nookie's the bomb
She had niggaz wrapped around her middle finger, like the female Fonz
But anyway know what, I'mma call her again
Dododododododo, if she diss me, I'mma fuck up her Benz

"Hello?"
   "Hey woman, this is the second time I've called you!"
"So what?"

[Chorus: sample]
I decided to update my crew..
Partyin' hard and stayin' on the move..
Playin' it cool, takin' it as they come..
Not rushin' into love with anyone
Last night changed it all.... I really had a ball
Last night changed it all.... I really had a ball

[Outro: girl (Ghostface Killah) and Theodore Unit]
Damn, nigga, stop fuckin' touchin' me
(Come on, ma, I thought you had an ant on your leg)
Man, you know I ain't have no fuckin' ant on me
{This nigga Starks got ants in his car!}
(Muthafucka! You got ants in your mouth, bitch!)
*Aiyo, Tone, aiyo, Tone, watch the way you drivin', man
It's snowin' right now!* (Muthafucka, I got it, nigga I got it!)
*Your drinkin' and drivin' and shit*
(Muthafucka.. give me another shot of that goose
I mean come on, give me some more Goose nigga!)
*Aiyo son sweatin' bullets back here and shit, g*
Yo roll the window down, yo, he bowling ball head, he bowling ball head
(Yo, aiyo, I nigga, thrown over my shit)
Man, fuck that shit, Starks who the fuck record over it
(Yo listen, baby, I camp real slow right now) Man fuck this
Muthafucka we in the Bronx, man! Be quiet, yeah you right (hold on, hold on)
Oohh shit... that's that Theodore shit right here, g!</pre>
