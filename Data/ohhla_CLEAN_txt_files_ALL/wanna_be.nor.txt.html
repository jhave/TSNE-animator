[Intro]
N. -is for that nigga, who keeps banging.... banging
O. -is for outstanding everyday....... everyday
R. -is for ridiculous crazy....... so crazy
E. -is for extraordinary ways....... everyway "rideout"

[Chorus]
They want to be like you, smoke like you, live like you
But they can't fuck with, thug like him, dro like him
If you forgot the name, and you been wondering it's
N.O.R.E, N.O.R.E
They want to be like you, smoke like you, live like you
But they can't fuck with, thug like him, dro like him
If you forgot the name, and you been wondering it's
N.O.R.E, N.O.R.E

[Verse 1]
Ayo these chicks love me, and even though I got chubby
Mommy see me in the club want pop bubble
I'm like yo ma stop it, cause I'm a smirnoff rocket
I'm loving my life, and never out of pocket
I fuck dogstyle chick, I'm thugged out and rich
I drink henny that's the same shit that i piss
And I don't care about a ice wrist, I got a ice pick
Plus a ice chick, she suck ice dick
God favorite so the stay attracted
And you could fuck with the guard or get subtracted
I'll have you hideout, like when thugged out slide out
These niggaz listen like when swizz scream rideout
N.O.R, twenties on rims on ill car
You could ask Def Jam they inherited a star
You see I take flicks, and we hit the knick chicks
Bag twenties and sell them in the hood for Nick's

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It's still bang bang, yeah mommy it's still the samething
And you could feel on my jock, and see I'm all cock
And we could chill on your block, why not
Niggaz love me anywhere, a hood I'm there
I told nigga last year, that I ain't care
You acting like the little nigga break yo, still don't care
Whoa so if you with it, I can hit it and go
And call you from the hood later, after hugging some doe
N.O I keep it all good, I smoke more wood
And as far as my chicks, I keep them all hood
One time jake chase me, I started to dip them
And when I ran by shortie, she started to trip'em
Damn shortie "what" we've been through a lot together
I even had you on the block slinging rocks together
It's not a stress day, so i'm hit the expressway
Meet you at your crib in a hour, with a dress tray

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm from Q.U. double E.N.S
The first nigga selling crack with a black g.s
I like the lex, nigga so I copped the shit
And now it's summer time now, so I dropped the shit
Whatever, you want beef, better get it together
Cause I can have niggaz follow you and blast your leather
You see we thugged out, and got whips with dip dishes
Go head and keep fronting, you could sleep with the fishies
It go...</pre>
