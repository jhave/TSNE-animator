Song:   The Wind of Revolution
Typed by: j_relax@graffiti.net

Fuck, the city streets are raining bullets 
The wind of revolution screams: "come on do it" 
Hey, looking at this rawness upon us 
Makes sick soldiers enter the darkness 
Begin a circle around the center 
Of power then break down the whole tower 
The winner will be the man 
That grabs the steel by the hand and pulls the damn trigger 
I warn you when the worldwide weather report gets shaken 
What-cha gonna do? 
I choose to be deadly unpredictable 
Earthquake weather forever
