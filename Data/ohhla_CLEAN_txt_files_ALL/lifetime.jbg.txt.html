Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Well I met this girl from the country
She wants to know everything that's about me
Are you single, what is your age, she's kinda hesitant cause everybody plays the game
But meeting you was so surprising I was a stranger in your town you walked by me
Now can we just talk, just take a walk, one minute and you will see
Whoooa La-da-di-de-die-day
I can tell by your eyes you wanna swing my way
Be your love that or will will miss laday, come unwind with me, me now baybay

Well she knows I got the remody, the real thing, not only physically
I need a lifetime lover, not a nighttime lover
Now it's getting kinda serious, don't be scared don't be delirious
I need a lifetime lover, not a nighttime lover

She got me hooked like nicotine, can't eat or walk or talk or look, or sing or do anything kiss
It was a one night thing, well I know you know what I mean
The way she cried I felt we made love, knowin I did was strong and she just can't sha shake it off
It was a one night thing, well I know you know what I meannnn
But end up wonderin whys whys gotta be this wayyyy
I guess it's that chance you take, wonderin if, wonderin if you are the one

Well she knows I got the remedy, the real thing, not only physically
I need a lifetime lover, not a nighttime lover
Now it's getting kinda serious, don't be scared don't be delirious
I need a lifetime lover, not a nighttime lover

Well I met this girl from the country
She wants to know everything that's about me
Are you single, what is your age, she's kinda hesitant cause everybody plays the game
But meeting you was so surprising I was a stranger in your town you walked by me
Now can we just talk, just take a walk, one minute and you will see
Wooo a laaddaadiiidddyyydddaaadiiiddayyy
I can tell by your eyes you wanna swing my way
Be your love that or will will miss laday, come unwind with me, me now baybay

Well she knows I got the remedy, the real thing, not only physically
I need a lifetime lover, not a nighttime lover
Now it's getting kinda serious, don't be scared don't be delirious
I need a lifetime lover, not a nighttime lover

Well she knows I got the remedy, the real thing, not only physically
I need a lifetime lover, not a nighttime lover
Now it's getting kinda serious, don't be scared don't be delirious
I need a lifetime lover, not a nighttime lover</pre>
