Intro:
Big Black A&amp;B representitive. Blaze It Up remix like that.
What? Blazin' it up across the land to Japan. Like that.
O.K. it's goin' down baby. No doubt
word up. A-yo Honda spit some hot shit. Blaze it up son.

A&amp;B:
Yo Black Attack yes indeed 
Read to set this off no matter what the speed
Cause I flips my delivery 
Uncontrolably foul on you son duke why you holdin' me?
I guess it's the way I brake ya ankles with the lyrical
Like Allen Ive shakin' Mike down somethin' hysterical
You believe in miracles (what?) well good
Cause If's gonna take that times infinity to keep me out your hood
(Slow down) I can't I'm blazin' like fire with no wood (oh)
You brakin' shit down so it's all understood
Ha ha bring that back
Funkdafied like Da Brat Black Attack flipppin' the track
Representin' like that let me find out y'all cats
Don't know (y'all don't know) black about to blow like Po (like Po)
Without the doe (without the doe) so yo fast or slow
I glow like a three double 0 
Vergo's in the house now flow

Hook:
Blaze it up up up up we gon burn it down "Blaze it up"-Onyx
Blaze it up up up up Honda brings it down
Blaze it up up up up we gon burn it down
Blaze it up blaze it up

Sean Black:
They use to call me Sean Black 
Known for being a Trooper like Isuzu
Not worried about what you do
Black magic like voodu 
But still proceed to shoot my lyrics right through you
You ask for a battle son I bring it right to you (oh yeah)
Rep to Roosevelet Island run with A&amp;B 
Got props all over the world like the B.C.C.
We be the illest, strong arm like Kevin Willis (Willis)
I feel it's time to let them know who be the realest
Fake cats play the back while get this doe
You can bring your best but you can never match this flow
Black the new kid, the one you never heard of (heard of) 
Nigga that's on some cool out shit but lyrically commiting murder
Touch tracks upf rom the back up 
Niggas betters top slackin' off and twist this sack up
This the Black Attack shit what?
Y'all niggas know how it go y'all could never stop the flow
That's my word baby bro

Hook

Sure enough funky DJ Honda oooh.
Black Attack in the house oooooh</pre>
