[Sean Price]
Oh...
Oh shit yo (yo)
Yo son whattup it's Ruck
Oh shit yo (yo)
Yo son whattup it's Ruck son
Whassup with them Boost Mobile shits son (oh word?)
Peep the verse nigga, peep it

From the South to the West to the East to the North
Go off, Sean P go off, a go off
And yes yes y'all (y'all) you don't stop (stop)
Ruste Juxx, Boot Camp, Big Ruck and Rock
Aiyyo emcees and my niggaz call me Sean
When I empty the 9, then yo' shine is gone
Perennial felon, quick to throw a shell in your melon
With a gun so loud it sound like, elephants yelling
BONG~! Big guns we squeeze 'em at y'all
Now Ruckus is +Out For Justice+ like Steven Seagal
+Marked For Death+, +Hard to Kill+, double-oh-seven
Hockey neck, spark the Phil', nigga
So easy to snuff a nigga up in broad daylight
'specially when niggaz bitch more, more gay type
Yo, ain't flashin, grade A smashin
Deebo wanna fight, give the nigga brain a bashin
My occupation is rappin, your occupation is hatin
So rock with the God and stop hatin with Satan
It's the, passion of Price, not the passion of Christ
But the God Christ like when I be rockin the mic

Hello? Yo P?
Yeah bitch ass nigga hung up man
P!!</pre>
