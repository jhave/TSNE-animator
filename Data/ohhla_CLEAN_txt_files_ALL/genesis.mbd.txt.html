Respect this right here nigga.. I-M-D
You must play this.. I-M-D, word up
Yeah, you know, Infamous Mobb Deep
It's real.. check it out tho'

Respect the I-M-D
Fresh out the car in the R-A-double-P, E-R
P-E-double, when I speak it gets real
Flakes try to tell me, "Yo Dunn, nah chill
You can't come out, wylin out like that
Rhymes so vivid Dunn I see what you sayin"
But you gotta understand how I feel
The pain and the hardship it took to build
Years of frustration, some got killed
Others fell vic' to the gates of steel
Most try to instill sanity still
stuck on this rock where we don't belong
I wanna go home not sing this song
but I'm forced to perform speech napalm
Calm, surrounded by all types of harm
Dogg man fuck your screwface I watch hands

Watch your hands nigga, I see that, word up..
Word up, peep y'all cats movements
Laid back in the cut like what?
Pay attention.. check it out Dunn

I'm bein watched by snake eyes
Peep them shed skin plenty times
Surrounded by crash dummies and empty minds
Get your shit together Dunn, see between the lines
Stay awoke, to the ways of the wickedest kind
Infamous - cause of the way, I write rhymes
Plus my story's more foul than your newborn eatin swine
(Stupid) Catch a seat, it's about to get deep
like squeezin flouride on your brush for your teeth
or, takin your seed to get shots every week
We need to pay more attention to our surroundings
Busy wildin, all for the wrong cause
Put that same strength into somethin that'll pay off
Don't forget your soul's involved
That same energy you put out, comes right back it revolves
I smash you, Dunn only if I have to
I would hate to, but I'll be more than glad to
The positive and negative war has now begun
P helps you seperate both the sides
Let the truth arise, black devil don't hide
You can't hide from me, you might from the others
I've been employed to pull your ass out from the covers
You walk like you got hooves and talk like you 'sposed to
Trickin my brothers into followin you?  Yo
Potential energy is easily made kinetic
I turn 'em all back where they belong, don't wet it
What? Set it..

Set it nigga, fuckin fake-ass motherfuckers
Take your mask off nigga what?  (what.. what..)</pre>
