[Bono](Wyclef)
Midnight she's on the street, she can't sleep
She's afraid to dream
Ten years old, my Spanish rose
You see things you never should have seen
Midnight she's on the street, oh she can't sleep
She's afraid to dream
Ten years old, my Spanish rose
You see things you never should have seen
(Let me do the guitar solo right here)
(I want all you kids to stand right now, come on let me hear y'all)
