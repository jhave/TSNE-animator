[Joe Budden]
Once again it's on
And we gonna ride out
Once again till dawn
Cut the lights out
Once again till morn
Keep the lights out
Till the end of the song

[Christina]
You're feelin' me
And it's got you all fired up
Tryin' to walk away
'cause you don't want your heart tied up

[Bridge]
But I can feel the proof when you're holdin' me
Like to let you think you're controllin' me
Even thought that ain't the deal
When I want I take the wheel, and I know
Can't hide that you're really into me
Hold is so tight I can barely breathe
'cause you know I keep it real
Giving you what you can feel

[Hook]
Whatever you want I got it
Whatever you need that's me
Feelin' the flow, don't stop it
Whatever you need I'll be
Whatever you want I got it
Whatever you need that's me
Feelin' the flow, don't stop it
Whatever you need I'll be

[Christina]
You're frontin' like
You don't want no one to know
But it's in your eyes
That you don't want me to go

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Joe]
We're gonna get it started, OK
Now go get the party jumpin' like me
Who crunk it like me
Lotta of guys here but none is like me
Though some could try to be
With two or three chains up under the white tee
And I got two or three dames that's comin' tonight

See 'em, done tonight leave
Like one, aight peace
Only Mike puts up numbers like these
And he's no longer playing
But neither am I, so
What I'm saying is hop in the deuce seater with I
'cause you know with them boots
And that beater you fly
Other dudes act to cheap with the pie
Won't drop a few pennies
Or cop you a guinea, but I'll cop you as many
Toast till the bottles all empty
Like pardon the Bravado in me
Us two that's a plan somehow
Get to know each other later
Let's dance for now, c'mon

[Hook x2]
Whatever you want I got it
Whatever you need that's me
Whatever you want I got it
Whatever you need that... that's me</pre>
