[Posdnuos]
Yo, and we won't stop rockin 'til we retire
Since the economy is such in them dire straits
That isn't an option, our theme is to be currency kings
Throughbred, NYC borough bred
We barrel through dirt and cracked open cement
These lines with pen, while I was semi-bent
The innocent Smilez {?} broke when he shook it
Remind me when my grandma used to say my way need a brace
'cause my ways used just seems so crooked
THe little black terror had a ball-bearer watcher
Bear Mountain skater, peace out
Premier take us out with the ("Forever")
...Peep out the transition 
The ammunition that we shootin is ambition
and implanted inside every history book
We the crew who travel to every cranny and nook
of the free world, freeing girls from they mate
Fill us all with hate, I know if I answered and slide
She move ahead back and forth instead of, {*Dave enters in*} side to side
{*both*} This be that one to ride to

[Dave]
The one that jump inside of and make love to your mind
I'm like that {nigga} baby
A Vancouver lady, Amsterdam boy
Sent to the earth to ambush at five point 1ne
Radio decks I revamp cassettes 
It's that digital age, ma, protect your credit card
Plastic dope on lasso rope on
Cowboy-style like giddy-up, she get {?}
Perky like morning coffee
Skin dark like coffee, {bitch} get off me
Fixed her mouth to mouth off and she lost me in that
Eve of the night, a plate of Monte Cristo, skip the disco
We leave in the night, rules don't apply the theives in the nights
Steal hearts like crooked card decks, with more facts
Show her more moeny on the budget, you gotta love it
Screams take flights liek spaceships at nights
Now count it off - "T minus..."
Reunited after degrees on September
The leaves begin rushing, the earth'll felt for it
Scores of faces, so we rock the bells for it
Now the horses shouldn'ta done me like that, I make sure we got 
glue for the summer, make due for the summer
Nine hundred horns, we done blew a new number
Drink with the king, I'm holdin on to 40s forever...
Forever...Forever...
Forever...Forever...

Forever...Forever...
Forever...Forever...
Forever...Forever...
Forever...Forever...
Forever...Forever...
Forever...Forever...
Forever...Forever...
