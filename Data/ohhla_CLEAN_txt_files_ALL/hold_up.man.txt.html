[Biz Markie]
Aowwww!... this joint is funky!
Aowwww!... this is funky!
Yeah, yo Kurt this beat is funky
You know that right?
Yo, and you know me, I'm the Biiiiz Markie
I'm with my man Motion Man
You want me to kick a funky rhyme?
Okay, I'll kick one just for y'all...

Hello everybody, and how do you do
I'm here to rock the house without further a due
I know you like the way my rhythm sway
Me, rock parties on down to the break of day
The way I be doin' my rap technique
No matter who you are, you can say it's unique
My perpendicular, my New York slang
I'm more popular than Spanky and the Gang
Never rode a motorcycle, never flew a kite
But a lot of women fight for my delight
Chillin' the most from Coast to Coast
For breakfast I O.Eazy-E.'s, eggs and toast
Blood, sweat and tears in every rhyme I write
Have your body jigglin' like cellulite
If you wanna get down with the rhymin' tech
Get on the floor, shake a leg and break ya neck

[Chorus: Motion Man] (Biz Markie)
Hold up, we done did it
"He's Biz Markie"
(Hold up, wait a minute!)
"Motion Man with these things"
Hold up, we done did it
"He's Biz Markie"
(Hold up, wait a minute!)
"Motion Man with these things"

[Motion Man]
I'm a bold and cold, do a load and unload
A round of raps that'll pap smear
The organ mouth rapper, his gap's wide, gates open
Gynecologist? No, Motionologist - and 211's my thang
I'ma snatch the work from all you poppies and mommies
Like the stock market low did to several dot commies
Look at this, it's the diabolical Biz Mark' kids
he friends with the Mo-Shhh-on Man
Big events, Biz and the Motion, the hecklin' starts
out the crowd, clownin' MC's like D.L. Hughley
Regulate 'em, megalo maniac'n today
Then commentate the medley, steadily reppin' The Bay
So pass the Old Gold this way, I'm all day mayne
Nice in the gym, no range, shootin' sprees
from the nose bleed section, the teams and referees
Man the whole damn crowd is now my poster child

[Chorus: Motion Man] (Biz Markie)
Hold up, we done did it
"He's Biz Markie"
(Hold up, wait a minute!)
"Motion Man with these things"
Hold up, we done did it
"He's Biz Markie"
(Hold up, wait a minute!)
"Motion Man with these things"</pre>
