Night life, hey girlie don't ya frown 
That's right, Saint's parents are outta town 
Night life, and you know we're gonna do it right 
That's right, cuz kottonmouths in the house tonight 

Well I'm sittin at Saint's, gettin' ready for the party 
Sippin' on a tall cat (?), callin' up the hotties 
come over here and get a rip of this dank 
I love the lovely herb so i loaded the thang (the lord i do thank?) 
The stereos bumpin' got some freaks on the way 
Man i need another tall one to get in my sway 
The freaks show up we're gonna look like no other 
Hey dude watch out she's got a big ass brother 
No need to worry, don't even stress 
Look at honey over yonder in the tight black dress 
Damn you ain't lying no need for dissention 
Now check out my skillz as I get her attention 

Hey shorty, hey shorty, hey shorty 
Girl don't act like you don't know me 

Night life, hey girlie don't ya frown 
That's right, Saint's parents are outta town 
Night life, and you know we're gonna do it right 
That's right, cuz kottonmouths in the house tonight 

We forgot our box of smokes so off we went 
Are you alright to drive? Nah bitch i'm bent 
When i heard that man i knew it was trouble 
Bitch was stompin on the brakes like hes Barney Rubble 
Back to 22 (??) when we got to the liquor store 
Slide on my shades as i walked through the front door 
Cuz yo, i was steady blazed, i felt like i was in Jimi's purple haze 
I bought a bag of chips cuz you know i got the munchies 
And some ruff riders for all the freaky honeys 
Hey yo, stop barkin' you're fuckin' up my high 
And i got the freak with the light brown eyes 
Man pussy ain't got a name on it 
Every time loc's drunk he tries to put a claim on it 
So if yer gonna crack man you better do it right 
Cuz theirs 3 kottonmouths in the house tonight 

Night life, hey ladies don't you frown 
That's right, Richter's parents are out of town 
Night life, and you know we're gonna do it right 
Kottonmouths in the house tonight 

When we got back to the party the place was packed 
Look at all the hotties, I'm about to mack 
Should we take the back door? No lets cruise the front 
Oh yeah - and Dloc fire up that phillie blunt 
Look over there, bitches straight kissin' 
Tongue rings and all, what the fuck we missin? 

Lesbos, the best lay in town 
Lesbos, they like to play around 
Lesbos, they're really freaky chicks 
The only problem is they don't like to play with dicks 

Now the cops just arrived and they're ringin on the bell 
Everybody keep it down, i put some clothes on my self 
You see here son we've had a few too many calls 
There's far too much noise knockin' off these walls 
You need to break it up, you're disturbin the peace 
Well, I'm sorry officer, fuck the police! 

Night life, yo bitches don't you frown 
That's right, Daddy Richter's outta town 
Night life, and you know we're gonna do it right 
That's right, cuz kottonmouths in the house tonight 

Night life, hey girlies don't you frown 
That's right, kottonmouth is in your town 
Night life, and you know we're gonna do it right 
That's right, kottonmouth in the house tonight 

Kottonmouth, punk rock </pre>
