[ VERSE 1 ]
I roll hard (Oh-oh, oh my God!)
That's right, baby, I run the yard
Got the bass for your bottom, if you feel it in your butt
Do your dance, and I tell you what
When this party is over, there'll be no more rappin
You and I can spread out, and anything can happen
If the party's not enough, and you still think you're ready
You ain't gotta clap your hands and dance, but we can still rock steady

Rock steady
Rock steady
Rock steady, baby

If the party's not enough, and you still wanna rock, say...

Rock (rock) steady (steady)
Come on, rock (rock)

Rock (rock) steady (steady)
Come on, rock (rock) steady (steady)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Am I a trooper? I'm a super scooper
I enlist girls like I was a recruiter
Gettin ready for an all-out war
I'm a lover, that's out to score
I wanna see you at the party, we can dance a bit first
And if you really rock your body, we ain't even gotta converse
After the party, all I wanna do is come over
And tell you that I want you
And if you don't wanna go, just listen to the drums
Feel the beat - and it'll make you come
And don't try to front, cause I'll call your bluff
Don't kick me no bass, cause I got enough
Just let the music keep flowin, watch your head start goin
Up and down, suggestin 'yes' without ever knowin
You'll be soaken wet and drenched, sweaty and ready
But not to clap your hands and dance, but you can still rock steady

Rock (rock) steady (steady)
Come on, rock (rock) steady (steady)

Rock steady, baby

[ VERSE 3 ]
Ladies, if you've been gettin the short end of the stick
Come over here and get some of this real di-
Different kind of lovin that I call rockin
Oh boy, can I rock? All night long
Cause my rap is strong
I betcha I'll rock your socks
Cause I'm a super lover, undercover
Watch your sister and your mother
Scream, dream, cream, kick, bite and fight each other
I make em drool, cause I'm so cool
I got the tool to rule, and I guarantee you'll
Encounter a night like never before
If you ever walk through my party doors
You come over and over, again and again
And next time you'll bring a friend
Because at my party you gotta be ready
Cause I'm takin no shorts, baby doll, I'ma make you rock steady

Come on, rock (rock) steady (steady)
Come on, rock (rock) steady (steady)
Rock (rock) steady (steady)
Everybody, rock (rock) steady (steady)

Rock steady, baby</pre>
