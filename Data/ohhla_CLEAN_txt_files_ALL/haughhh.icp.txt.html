I'm Violent J
I breath toxic fumes and throw my lungs up 
all over your brand new patten-leather penny loafers
You fuck!

I'm 2dope
I got sick ass sewer sludge stuck in my throat
And I live in a big pipe on Sog Island
So stop by and have a bowl of rust, you fucking bitch-ass faggot

Faggot, you bitch ass faggot
I'm in the south-west detroit, Del-ray
In a city, ghetto street-gang
I got people who want me dead
But everytime they run up on me, I get scared
And my skull explodes
All over those motherfuckers

Sometimes I get hungry, man, but it ain't nothing
But it ain't nothing in the box but a brick sandwich
So I start hurting that motherfucker
And I chew on that bitch until my jaw breaks
Which don't fade me, cause I'm a hoodlum
And I don't exist to you fucks (you fucks)
You green-grass fucks

Fuck me, and I'll fuck you, fucker
We comin', motherfucker
We coming to get ya
Coming to get ya
How ya see me is what ya get
How ya see me is what ya get
Carnival of carnage is coming
How ya see me is what ya get

I was snookin' good in my bed
Woke up to find my brain fell out my head
Stuffed it back in with a screwdriver, I'm that much liver
I can walk on my hands on a tight rope
But then I always fall, and bust my ass.
But it really don't matter (really don't matter) (don't matter) don't 
matter, cause I'm in the haugh

In the haugh, in the haugh
Violent, Violent J's in the motherfucking haugh
I'm in the haugh, you's in the haugh
We in the motherfucking what? Haugh!
(With the wiked town, south west gang, wicked joker's 
kill, southwest thrill)

Get off me, dog, I'll shit face
I mean I ain't got shit on my face, but ya know
People in the suburbs hate me (why?)
Southwest carnival crazy (hiii)
My mind ain't nothing but a lemon
But I mean it's fucking yellow and shit
I don't know man, fuck off
You can't fade me, vato, cause I'm in the haugh!

In the haugh, in the haugh
2dope Shaggy's in the motherfucking haugh
I'm in the haugh, you's in the haugh
We in the motherfucking what? Haugh!
(With the wiked town, south west gang, wicked joker's 
kill, southwest thrills)

I'm greasy, and I can moonwalk
But I don't, cause that shit's so fucking played out
Instead, I just grab this wang, and tell you that I'm in the haugh, bitch!
Parachute pants, and moon boots
Chilling on the corner butt-naked hurting fruit loops
Fuck a hill billy goat
Sitting in the tub, I let my nuts float, cause I'm in the haugh

In the haugh, in the haugh
Granny's all in the motherfucking haugh
I'm in the haugh, you's in the haugh
We in the motherfucking what? Haugh!
(With the wiked town, south west gang, wicked joker's 
kill, southwest thrills)

Southwest is in the haugh!
D.C. is in the haugh!
I'm in the haugh, in the haugh, in the haugh
Hamma, hamma, hamma
East dogs in the haugh
Jump steady in the haugh
Hammer in the haugh, too!
Mike Clark in the haughhh!
Mr. T's in the haugh!
Hamma, hamma
