Mami mira

[Verse 1: Mr. Criminal]
It's Saturday night, and I was up in the spot
I
Looked at my watch and it was eleven o'clock
So, uh
I looked up
And what did I see
About eleven to twelve ladies in the V.I.P.
A couple of hundred of the people havin' fun like me
All at the bar, sippin' on Hennessey with no ID
So I creep
To the back, just to post up
Sippin' on Coronas with some liquor in my
Cup
I see some ladies on the dance floor, gettin' down
Dancin', shakin', movin', makin' love to the sound
There was this one that caught my eyes, she turned around
With no surprise, "Excuse me, baby girl, I like what I found"
Mami mira, tu eres muy bonita
Chiquita linda, mas, mira, I would stunt when I see ya
I
Hit the bar, took two shots of tequila
Grab the lady by her hand
And I had to tell her

Repeat Chorus

Bridge: Nate Dogg
Something about you, mami
I'm feelin' you, girl, can't you see that look in my eye
Something about you, mami
And the way you move, you just keep blowing my mind
Something about you, mami
I could see me and you spendin' some quality time
Cause you're so fine

[Verse 2: Mr. Capone-E]
Don't Get It Twisted, poppin' up in the club
All eyes on us, ladies showin' us love
Mr. Capone-E, Criminal, Nate Dogg on the cut
Stretched limousine, and we livin' it up
Don P., baby
You should Be A Model
We're lookin' for some video hoes, that want a bottle
And get faded with the greatest in the club
Chica bonita, muy reina, lovin' that butt
Lovin' that rush
Now throw it on up
We're havin' a parle
And gettin' laid is a must
Waitress on hush (Sshhh)
Tip her a G
Big Nate Dogg, tell her what we're up out, ma

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Mr. Criminal]
So what's it gonna be
I got a spot
Oh, you live at the ocean for you and me, you wanna come and see
We can get away, just set a day aside
Call on me, girl, any day and night
And I can't be your Superman, but you can be my Playmate
Checking into hotels, checking out a day late
Makin' love from night, or
All the way til day break
Baby girl, that's just my style, never will I hesitate
So take a run with me, girl
Won't you come with me
Life at its finest for you, baby, that's what it comes to be
And I ain't tryin' to put no ring on your finger
We just havin' a good time, Nate, sing it to me

Repeat Chorus

[Nate Dogg] You wanna hang with big Nate Dogg
            And Criminal
            It's in your eyes you wanna get
            Us some
[Fingazz]   {*scratching*}
            "Fingazz on the track..."
[Nate Dogg] It's in my eyes, you know I love
            That lady
            I'm looking for me a Spanish
            Girl</pre>
