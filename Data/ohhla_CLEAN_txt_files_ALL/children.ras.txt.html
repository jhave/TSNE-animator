(Rasheed talking to his kids) 

Verse 1 

Remember back in the day 
Parents givin us a thrashin 
Diggin in that ass like its some kind of passion 
And now I understand why 
Just watchin my children growin up 
Make a hustler wanna cry 
Cause everything weve been through 
They must experience 
Will they learn the hard way? 
Or come up with common sense 
But what about the baby lyin lonely in the dumpster 
Never given a chance 
Will he be a victim of hunger? 
What have I done? 
Why am I here? 
But little do this baby know 
This happens year 
Little Ray made it pass the pacifier 
Now he a passive liar 
Smoke fire 
A murder for hire 
Little John his gang initiation 
Infiltration 
Findin in the enemy location 
Cut em down 
One round 
Soldier got his stripes 
Comrades hype 
Hopin and dreamin to sterotype 
Undercovers penetrated the G cult 
Caught a youngster 
Trailed him as an adult 
Now he doinlife 
Young flesh turned fool 
This is the world through the eyes of a child 

(Rasheed talking to his kids) 

Verse 2 

Ever wonder why you keep finding Barbie dolls dismantled? 
Cause your husband got his step-daughter watchin the porno channel 
Touchin her in a way 
To 10 years she rather live her life gay 
You call your son stupid 
Then he gone think he stupid 
Put that word in his head 
And his brain will loop it 
Over and over till he find love in this wicked world 
Left home in search of diamonds and pearls 
Heart in a twirl 
Met a girl 
Put his mind in a swirl 
But no one gave a referal to her husband Mr. Earl 
Caught him early in the mornin 
Lookin at this young punk 
Heart couldnt take it 
Suffocated em put him in a trunk 
Wife kept quiet 
World I beg your pardon 
But thats why so many of our babies endin up on milk cartons 
I hold my babies with the grip of a anaconda 
Stare at em closely 
Put the emotions inside my binder 

(Rasheed talking to his kids) 

Verse 3 

I wrote this outta love for the kids of the Earth 
Surfin this tough turf 
For what its worth 
To all the new born 
I give my soul for the Lord to bless 
And to all my homies with infants up in this wickedness 
Birth control 
The worst control miscarriage 
No lullabies 
Unborn babies in disparage 
Let the semen enter the center inside the placenta 
When the child is born 
Watch him grow to anos cescenta 
60 years but I will live to see it 
I made this tape for planet 
If it happen so be it 
Baby Bambinos to Godfathers 
If I lose my faith 
I lose my space 
Never misuse my pistol on my waist 
My little nephew tears in eyes askin me why 
His best friend makin bullets fly
