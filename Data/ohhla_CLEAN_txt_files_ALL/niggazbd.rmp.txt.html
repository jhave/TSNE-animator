Chorus 4X
Simma rhyme, simma love, do these niggas iz bad
I was sure to suck a nigga, whose the dick iz bad

[Serious]
Yo yo yo yo
In ya face, in ya face, in ya face
Come taste the paste their is inside the hell's place
Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up and give me space
I set the pace in the race
Gloom I count baroom baroom and then soon
Like a local mountain hard explosive
Rims that's reem and concrete, yes an asphalt
Guess it's my fault, no It's a Earth shattering experience
To get strangled from ya clearance gon sample as an example
What make ya creep or make a croak
O must fall into the yard, guess it
Yes it, yes it, yes it, yes y'all
Feel the vibe of the wall
Step in, step real like a record reckin' reckin ball
That's how I deck the halls
Just check ya skills, you don't got the balls

[arguing]

[Rampage]
Simma rhyme, simma love, I'm a show brothers
As I walk thru the valley of death, check the sonic boom
Pass the lighter, I beat ya down like Street Fighter
It's the Boy Scout, true game
I'm the A-1, the out the world
Now I'm goin trial, cuz the Boy Scout fit down ya girl
Know I'm the heavy weight, the Brooklyn Bomber
I got to represent, word to Scout Sana
I got my hat turned back, nigga don't say that
I bet ya catch ya contact, cuz Boy Scout is all that
Aiyo Ra, flip the drums, I'm gonna break gums
I peep for MC's, with the sa sa swollen thrums
I'm a broadcast, yo a brother I'm a bast ya isle
It's the Boy Scout, doin the desk
Now I got the broadcast to represent
I'm lettin brothers know the Boy Scout don't give a fuck
Cuz I'm a rock rock rip, too young to slip
Rollin down with a nine clip, plus I gotta rip a rip
I break it down to the dozen, I be with awesome shit
I even live with all my fuckin girl cousin
I lived in mountain nigga, Rampage is the bomb
Cuz I'm tell ya, Rampage is the brom
About to break two, 1994
Flipmode is the Squad, raw
