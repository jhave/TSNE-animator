[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm on a paper chase for the doe
Promoters better get my doe
After the show
There's like no
Reason to be in a situation where
Fists and Tims is flying in your faces, and
Body parts get ripped apart
Don't think because I'm underground you won't get got
I'm cool
Relaxed throw back
The Cognac
You fool
I drink from the bottle and not the glass
Live Hip-hop, flip-flop's, drop top niggaz
Barber shops, stups, blocks, hard rock niggaz
Keep grilling me
It's just a part of game
It's a part of the landscape and the terrain
I maintain
Vision is clear
Studied my peers
No longer will I waste a whole night on beer
I spent years
Crafting the art, write from the heart
And most niggaz need to return to the start
It's alright
Rappers won't all see the light
Rappers won't all get chance on the mic
But most like-ly., they get in a Bar fight
That's just not me
That's not my life

[Chorus]
I'm not trying to fight black
I'm just cool, calm and relaxed
So won't you do your thing, son and I'm a do mine
I put my life on the rhyme

[Verse 2]
Recorded on a Tasc 4-track
Tapes, adats, adats to wax
Niggaz act
Like I ain't be dropping 'em gems
Like my hands ain't been on the ASR 10
Nigga
Like I'm a virgin to this
Like me production ain't the murderess shit
Like you ain't a dime a dozen
Cousin I'm ill
Appeal
With unmistakable rhyme skill
It's real
I built it from the underground up
How dare you tell me that the underground sucks
I spill my life, my guts
My feelings on music
Not only do I show, son I prove it
Niggaz pack ruggers, nines, knives and such
A severe case of bad luck
Must of struck
How fast can you get a buck
Quick for the dollar
A rope on your neck niggaz quick for the collar
Life's bitch, but the bitch don't sleep
You spend most of your time in the street
That's weak
I spend most of time with the beats
I'm really hard to reach
In the studio my time is increased

[Chorus]</pre>
