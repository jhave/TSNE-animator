[Intro]
Yeah (yeah), Rapper Pooh back at it (y'know)
Hah, servin up, servin up the classics for you addicts
(Serve it up man, give it to 'em)
Yeah, (feels good don't it), I'ma give it this time Khrysis
Check it out, everybody just listen, yo, uh

[Verse 1]
Oh my God, yes indeed
Who got the knack to give you what you need?
Move with speed, legendary emcee
Born in VA, transport to NC
One year removed from a classic LP
Two years ago we started up LB
Ay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I'ma flow till there's ain't none left in me
You got a problem with me? Homeboy step to me
Show you more than verbal weaponry
Cause I walk with a..., I talk with a...
Remember little young'n, play your part and uh
Everything will be ok
Rapper Pooh old school like Eddie Levert singin with O'Jays
There's no way y'all could lift like me
Pooh Ferrigno, the master MC

[Hook]
Rock to the rhythm, they can't see me
Chillin in the cut, yeah that's where they find P
Rock to the rhythm, they can't see me
Chillin in the cut, yeah that's where they find P
Rock to the rhythm, they can't see me
Chillin in the cut, yeah that's where they find P
I bare it all, even more I can take
You couldn't find another nigga who could carry this weight

[Verse 2]
"It's the world's greatest!" I know it put a dagger in your heart
For your child, I have to say this
Off hiatus, I'm back with the latest
Put me on your playlist, they feelin me Young
Got the whole game sprung, not fingers and toes
Everybody's all froze like heroin's in their nose
Addicts, I suppose say my product is lethal
My pen been compared to a hit of that diesel
My flow's been compared to a trip off wet
These words been said, they ain't figured them yet
When your boy Rapper's here, ain't no need to fret
Don't worry bout givin cause I'm takin respect
Big Dho cut the checks cause it's time to get paid
Drinkin Evian, lay back in the shade
Special like air, findin ways to get paid
And won't stop till that whole money get made
