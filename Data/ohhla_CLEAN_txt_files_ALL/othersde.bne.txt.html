[Layzie]
Lil' Lay, hey (Yeah, yeah)
What's up playas (What's happenin' out there?)
Thugstas, and hustlas?
(Yeah, yeah, it's all real, yeah)

[Felecia]
And I want you to know (I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Oh, you know it ain't easy
yeah, you know it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(Don't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(Don't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game

[Layzie]
I lived in darkness for years
And barely can see through the smoke
At the end of my rope from sellin' that dope
Been makin' them dum-dums out of soap
And I hope to be a better man
Never did I understand what I had
My attitude mad, young and bad
Fila, Levis - still sportin' the sag
Walkin' the streets, lightweight thinkin'
Plottin', worryin' my Mama to death
Wanna go home, but somethin' won't let me
'Cause I know she got problems her chest
It's a struggle, a puzzle - the pieces so scattered
We find 'em, take your time and put it together
Nigga, quit walkin' around like you're blinded
Put your mind on your money, thug
Don't worry about what you got
Open your eyes, and peep the plot
Say your prayers, achieve a lot
Nigga, don't stop 'til you drop
Somewhere in a box, locked and buried
Other than that, my nigga, just smile
And don't worry (don't worry)

[Layzie] (Felecia)
And I want you to know (I want you know, yeah)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(You know it ain't easy, you know it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks

[Thug Queen]
Bow my head, askin' the Lord for change
Since I started sellin' 'cane
Shit ain't been the same
Began to acknowledge my bang ways
Who can I blame?
Maybe my pain, dealin' with it by callin' it a phase
These are the last days
Carry no shame, everyday thangs
Went from sellin' cocaine to rockin' the stage
The otherside of the game
Where you're rich, my aim to fame
Strange - tradin' places, you're dealin' with races
Just wouldn't it be fate
Runnin' with thug, me never replace this
The Lord, I'd like to thank you for my Mo Thug family
Sincerely yours, Thug Queen (Thug Queen)

[Scant]
I remember my first day out of prison
Y'all: it was just me and my cousin
Takin' a ride in his car
We just went puffin' and sippin' on brews
Trippin' up old trues
Layzie asked me, "What you gonna do? What you gonna do?"
I said, "I don't know. I'm gonna take it slow
So gimme a couple of days, and I will let you know."
I had to collect my mind
Knowin' one day I'm gonna shine
Until that day, I will pray
And try to parlay with the struggle God done dealt me
I know that He'll help me
Through the stormy weather
Our families got together and stay strong
But you gotta keep your head up high
'Cause there ain't no reason
Why you got to let it down
Just look around, we platinum bound (bound, bound)

[Layzie] (Felecia)
And I want you to know (I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(It ain't easy, you know, you know ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain to the otherside of the game

[Sin]
Everything I ever knew since the day I was born
Consisted strictly of some type of a hustle
While my Mama workin' nine-to-five
On some nights, I be sittin' home alone
'Cause she'd be workin' doubles to survive
Makin' ends meet the best way she knew how
Keepin' food up on the table
Teachin' me the ways of the world - pick your friends
Like you do your fruit
Keep your distance from the playa hater
Pray you never have to shoot
I remember also on somedays there'd be nothin'
In our refrigerator except for a box of baking soda
And empty jar of pickle juice
I often wonder why the Lord
Had to create me in a world, oh so, so cruel
It's dog eat dog, I don't know what else to do
Except for call on God
Put my trust in You
No more, we're warriors.

[Ken Dawg]
I remember I went to school
With only about three pairs of pants, holes in my shoes
I guess I know what they mean by cold city blues
Ken bagged the stores
Tryin' to get money the best way I know how
How? Me and my brother up there
'Til hustlin' was no longer allowed
I know it's hardtimes
I'm learnin' this early to be a man
But since then, Ken Dawg flipped a whole new masterplan
Damn, don't nobody understand, but my family
But look at us now: the plan was to create jams
Ken Dawg, do or die, Mo Thug all the way to my dirt
I know it hurt--the way we put in work
Can't do nothin', but ride with it, 'til it's over
From Novas to Range Rovers, we're still soldiers

[Flesh-N-Bone]
You see a fellow like me
Done had it through all the wicked madness
Everyday I gotta fight this demon
Sadness take over my world of gladness
Then they wanna ask me,
"Why do we all stay so high, fiendin'?"
Come kick it the way we roll
That's if you can handle it, baby
Without you tryin' to hate me, never
No more, so fuck 'em, look at this hate
Now stroll and get on my hustle
To keep my pockets swoll for sure
I collect more of those
Still we prefer takin' bills that fold
To hoes, me and my trues decided
To plot you for your dues
Come through with the battle
Ran through your house
And robbed the people next door
Moved out neighborhood
Now, who would you blame it on?
The ghetto?
Why this old crooked system set up to mess us up
But we come up and never fade the soldiers' ghetto

[Layzie] (Felecia)
And I want you to know (ooh, I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy *it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks (just ask my folks)
And I won't blame it on the rain
(We can't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain (oh, no, yeah...)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game.

[Mo! Hart]
Stormy weather tossin' my boat to and fro
Often to the point of shatterin' senses
I don't know which way to go
Somethin' inside persistin' me to move on
Just maintain, hold on, but my son, just keep it strong
Everything gon' be alright
Keep you're head to the sky
Just as long as you keep it real
And strive to reach the golden prize
Did what I had to do to make it this far
A lot of people got stuck
And I took enough battlescars
Took refuge worldwide to replenish my thought
I was not ready to accept them devilish clout
Drop to my knees, and began to do nothin' but pray
Gradually, life began to change
I'm in this Mo Thug game
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim

[Krayzie]
Would you forgive me, Lord
If I killed that man - that man
That tried to run up and rob me blindly
And leave me for dead was his intent?
But, Lord, I may be like that on the outside
Inside I'm one that's searchin' for peace
Right, as we ride deep
And seek holy scriptures, believe
Rollin', nobody knows what it is or who we approachin'
Just strollin', trustin' in the Lord (in the Lord)
As we struggle to make it each day, baby
You can believe that they keep gettin' harder with the time
With haters and evil
And sometimes it's even my people
And it feel like I'm losin' my mind
Fire, you need to burn this entire evil, evil empire

[Layzie] (Felecia)
And I want you to know (to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Through the rain, through the clouds
Through the thunderbolts)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(And we can't blame it on the rain, no)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(We can make it through the pain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game</pre>
