[Hell Razah]
She was raised in Jamaica, skin tone chocolate Thai
Green eyes like Northern Lights, smelling right
Might be the same fame in the fortune type
She went on strike to legalise her birth right
Most artist's can't memorise their verse right
We call her Bamboo because she love the roll tight
Easy mamma, lick it like easy ___
Sucking up my brain cells made her even wiser
Died her hair purple haze and orange peel
Had a voice that reminded me of Lauryn Hill
Said she turned out Red and Meth in Cypress Hills
She was sweater than a Philly, the plenty of big wheels
She got raped by a Dutch Master
Be the reason that you come faster
I heard Garcia Vega had her, bagged her in California
They broke up 'cause of paranoia
Had the neighbours call the cops on her

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Your love it keeps me high
And I can't lie you got me hypnotised
That's why I never let-let you go, check it
Your love it keeps me high
And I can't lie you can look inside my eyes
That's why I never mixed it with blow
Your love it keeps me high
And I can't lie you got me hypnotised
That's why I never mixed it with blow </pre>
