Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Remember when my first meal was school lunch

Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch
Remember all for dinner all we ate was Captain Crunch
Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch
Went from good fella to commissary slips
Now I got back up man every time I slipped
Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing
Teacher always ask me, what was I doing
Scribbled in my notebook and never did homework
Low attention span, guess these Adderall worked
Rocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat
Rockport kicks way before we even smoked
Used to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it
Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting
Remember back then we thought we growed up
Rushing at a kid just to be grown up

[Chorus]
Rushing at a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up

[Verse 2]
I can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters
Burn up fire and drown drops of water
Son, I told you I got them beans like Goya
Gone off them pills got me jumping off the sofa
Hotter than a Hot Pocket out the devil microwave
Model bitches begging just be a nigga's sex slave
Exotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made
And when these bitches see me man they wetter than the everglades
Everyday same ish, me getting paid
Waking up, new bitch, it's me getting laid
Used to take bottle back, waitress bring the bottle back
Now they see me shining and they looking like a Sour Patch
Nigga Catch a heart attack, Newport soft pack never blow blunt wraps
But these blunt raps sewn up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up

[Chorus]</pre>
