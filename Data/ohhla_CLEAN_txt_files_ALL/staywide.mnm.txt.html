[Intro: Eminem]
Yea, yea (yea)
Follow me (follow me)
Come with me to the dark side, of the force (force)
No man would boldly go, to this place
The devil only knows, of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold
Oh so cold, ohh

[Chorus: Eminem]
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark (stay wide awake)
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go (stay wide awake)
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows (stay wide awake)

[Eminem]
Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, put my car in park and approach her tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider; hi there girl, you mighta
heard of me before, see whore, you're the kind of girl that I a-
-ssault and rape and figure why not try not to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian, yeah now let's see her have triplets and I'll di-
-sintegrate them babies as soon as they're out her with formalde-
-hyde and cyanide, girl you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
No need for no gunpowder, that only takes all the fun outta
murder and I'd rather go vinn-vinn and now you see just how the
fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uh
Shit wait a minute I mean skull, my knife seems dull, pull another one out, uhh

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-ens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin me play hide-and-seek, like Jason I'm so hungry
She's naked see, no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient, see I try to be but gee, why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep and I creep right through the front see
So blatantly but silently cause I know that she's sound sleep
"Who's wakin me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin me," she tries to scream, "Somebody please get him off me
He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughing like it's funny"
She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratchin like some dumb freak
Escapin me, no dice you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
or Satan, gee what a sight to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's all right with me, man life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause I'm dancing to quite a different drumbeat

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Better try to stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep it's your soul I'ma try to take
Pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?
Scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement, now ya
must've just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there
Prowler, there's no one fouler; bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub I drown ya with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how ya cower
Jump out on you now like I was Jawa from fuckin Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt, beddy-bye-bye, beddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
Oughta not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not ya everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nothing like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt, there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hackin 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1, someone's comin in from the back

[Chorus]</pre>
