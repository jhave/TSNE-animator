[Verse 1]
Yeah, I cut my heart open for you so I can feel it bleed
Fuck who you like, I'm the only rapper that you really need
Most people don't follow their dreams and they feel fine
It's probably why I don't I stalk, rape and kill mine
I took her handles off, shot her up and she miscarried
Fetus wasn't hard to bury, what comes next is arbitrary
Glad I recorded this, found out what haunted is
It turned out to be the ghosts of my aborted kids

[Chorus]
I don't need you, sure you do
I don't need you, you sure do
I don't need you, I'm sure you do
I don't need you

[Verse 2]
They led me through a catacomb where they conducted business
Ropes and torches in a fortress, some are begging for forgiveness
A language that I didn't understand was spoke a bit
Recognized every face in the room and started thinking "Holy shit"
And when I exited that night I was followed home
Snuck into bed with my bitch left pearls on her collarbone
There's no one here to free, though it appears to be
You don't have to believe to drown in the conspiracy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Refuse to drink the Koolaid and lay inside the tomb and
I talk to people who think that the God's like human
Only prey will pray, at best you can hope for nothing
Turn to anarchy so many times this shit just opens something
From the beginning until the death of my alliance
Wether we're in the ground, cremated or donated to science
I hope when I'm dead that my memorabilia
Will keep on touching the kids like pedophilia

[Chorus]</pre>
