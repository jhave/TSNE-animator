They call me Pillsbury Dough-bwoyyyy
Cause they know I really get that dough bwoyyyy
Dropped "Lean Back," it was so propers

Mo' guns, mo' nines, whole lotta, money
Mo' Biggie sing it with me, "Mo' Problems"
Uhh, it's the BX finest, Cook Coke Crack
Baby please rewind this, and yeah I know I'm hot
You don't need to remind us, ladies!
"Your royal penis is clean, your highness"
Uhh, I can't do nuttin right these days
Got chicks mad at me cause I lost some weight

And we 'bout to haunt the town in the sky blue Ghost
New York!  Damn I hate to brag and boast
But "I'm RICHHHH," Timbaland bring in the chorus

[Fat Joe]
You about to witness, greatness at it's prime
You should tape this
Matter fact, go 'head, congratulate us
Rucker, three-peat champ, see us Lakers (whattup Reem?)
Homey please don't hate us
She said that she was single, yo leave or make up - DAMN!
I'm out in L.A. within a week
Honies go to {?} from and they cut (aowwww)
V.A. is you wit me now
Couple bricks of that yay and it's Philly bound, feel me now
I'd rather die in prison, than to be a broke nigga
Live my life in the kitchen, into bakin pies
One of my addictions, on the mound
95 mile per hour pitches, volleyball servin 'em
The iron is itchin
To straighten any nigga out tryin to diss on... Crack

[Chorus 1]
[Timbaland] Everybody get up!
[Chorus 1]
[Timbaland] Everybody get up!
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 2]

[Fat Joe]
She's bad like MJ's sister
I ain't gotta talk fast, give a day and I'll twist her
Ain't gotta be celebrity to get with me, shit
I fuck bitches that look worse than...
As long as they head right and ass fat
I put a pillow over they face and ass that - Crack
'Bout to cruise down your avenue
In the back of that Cad, think collateral
Ain't no tellin what this clip and the Mac'll do
Ask Timb, I got the beat by kidnappin Maganoo
In other words don't fool with us
Aiyyo Timbaland, tell 'em what to do

[Timbaland] Everybody get up!
[Chorus 1]
[Timbaland] Everybody get up!
[Chorus 1]
[Timbaland] Everybody get up!
[Chorus 2]
