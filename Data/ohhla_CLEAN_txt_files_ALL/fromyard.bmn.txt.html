[Intro: Beenie Man]
Likkle Kim longside Beenie Man (Zagga zow zow zow)
Buuuuuummbaaaaa!!! Star!!! Yo yo!!!
America, carribean, a matter a fact the world, were comin at you
Kim, where you at babe?

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Gal flex, time to have sex
Jump in a your lex steam a blunt pop a Becks
Now you know that my style is rated XXX
Just lookin ain't a gal you no have nuff respect
I use to rock Sergio Tacchini, C And G bikinis
Now I'm hot steppin in my Queen Bee collection
Got gear to match my whips from monday to sunday
Designers give me exclusives straight off the runway
That's how it is, my shit is laid out
Some of y'all show up but like jeans y'all fade out, whatever
Fly out the crew hit the beach in Miami
Niggas watch me shake my fanny in my iced out panties
Beenie Man and Likkle Kim callin out (Beenie Man: Shout!!!)
People from east, west, north, and south
Say I'm the emcee with the nasty mouth
Put that on my unborn kids, we do it way big

[Chorus: Beenie Man] (Lil' Kim)
Gal open up the legs dem wide
and let me get inside that, and wuk you all night
A who this gal yuh waan bite
and kick up and a real like a man she waan fight alright
Open up your legs dem wide and let me get inside that, and wuk you all night
A who this gal yuh waan bite
and kick up and a real like a man she waan fight alright
From you a toppa toppa (Then throw dem bows)
Toppa toppa (Let the diamonds show)
From you a toppa toppa (Mi look good inna mi clothes)
Toppa toppa (Badgirl nah fi pose)

[Verse 2: Beenie Man]
So mi go so, hear mi dappa man a nuh rapper
Entertainer, worst man a real toppa toppa
Do wah, pop your collar, no bother holla,
Spend a thousand dollar, buy ganja and liquor cau wah

Chickenheads, and bout twelve hoochie mama
When, car hot, clothes pop off, get it together

[Chorus: Beenie Man] (Lil' Kim)

[Verse 3: Beenie Man]
