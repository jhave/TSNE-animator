[Eazy-E]
1,2,3, and to the 4
Eazy muthafuckin' E  
With the chrome to your dome
Cruisin' in my '64 rag top
I got a lot of juice
A lot of fuckin' block
Now when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
Keep the gat in my lap
Cuz I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers
Fuck no hapsters
I pack a Tech-9
Plus a AK-47
Send a one way ticket to my hell
Or maybe heaven, peep
Nigga I don't sleep
Burry muthafuckas in the concrete
You try creep kinda slow in a Astro
But I peep you niggas out in my left window
So I blast and I blast til I blast no mo
Yo, they call a muthafucka John Doe

[Chorus] x 4
Cuz when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'

[Roc Slanga]
Be a witness to murda
Niggas bustin' out of a '64 Chevy
Straight callin' my city
Niggas be winnin' and gettin' busy
Wit a tizy
Through my city
Chalk lines hang
Niggas bang
Chevy's swang like it ain't no thang
The gangs bang
So nigga tuck your chain
And try to buck this thang
End up gettin' one stuck in you brain
To refrain from this game of stressin'
Smokin' on water
And fin to bang your daughter
All up in the Best Western
She like the way that my '64 hop
Drop the top
Grab a rock
Now she's givin' me top
Non stop on the R-O-C
Like the made me screen
So I two-wayed my nigga Eazy-E

[Chorus] x 4

[Eazy-E]
Old nigga E still cruisin'
Punk stay up on the nuts and the bone
Pussy nigga had beef knocked out of his teeth
The muthafucka should have stayed his ass home
Hey yo peep them bitchez in the Honda
4 deep with the proper ass sounds
Now every time that I meet a fine cute bitch
She got a friend from the fuckin' Dog Pound
Hey yo bitch
Here's the seven digits
Call me if you can
Only if you want it
Let a nigga know
Can I dig like a minor, 49er
Diggin' for gold from behind her
Watch this nigga do some diggin'
Pop that pussy on a platter
Watch this nigga do some diggin'
It's so tight it doesn't matter
YO!

[Chorus] x 4

[Hook]
Hit them swithez [hit them swithez]
Hit them swithez [come on nigga]
Hit the swithez [make that shit bounce man]
Make it bounce [make it bounce homie]
Hit them swithez [man come on homie]
Hit them swithez [make that shit bounce homie]
Hit the swithez [three wheel motion]
Make it bounce [say what]

[Chorus] x 8

[Roc Slanga]
That's right nigga
We back
That real gangsta shit
From one of the realest niggas in this game
You know his name nigga
