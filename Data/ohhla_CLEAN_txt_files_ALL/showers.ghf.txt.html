   One goes through this rhyme that you
   He made up his mind
   That every little thing he does
   Be designed to entertain you (yeah)
   Ooooh (yeah), his whole life through (that's right)
   He's been walking through the rain (rain)
   Until the day he rhyme for you (uh huh, uh huh)
   And the sun came pouring down (tell 'em girl)

(Ghostface)
Ay yo, my rolls be Liberace
And my bedroom is off the hook all day, designed by Versace
Y'all just watch me, this is how I blow up
Right when y'all finna leave the joint then I show up
Star-spangled up and my chain got cuts
Mr. T looked, saw my shit and went nuts
Starks stays in luck, truck
There's a new gangster in town and he's coming up
Staten Island's cap on hoes with most info
Crown Royal bottles in the back, blowin Indo
Fly shit like Curtis Mayfield and his intro
Throw this in your whip, convent, your tens blow
Yo' I kick the ill rhymes like this
Y'all niggas really never wrote rhymes like this
C'mon, stop frontin at a time like this
Pretty Tone in the house, you better hide your bitch

   (Chorus: *Singer*)
   Ghost showers just a sign of the power
   You feel in you, oh baby
   Ghost showers got you by the hour
   You're dancing, too, oh baby

(Ghostface)
Behind the wall action
Barely spaghetti jewels, machetes for y'all
Little Debbie say "I bet he do"
Big bellies to big tellies, Jim Kelly's, we flip cellies
It's Lils, dusted out heavy in the big Chevy
Kicked the ill rhyme, nah, nah, I said it before
I keep the club moist, ladies throw they panties on the floor
Action, Atlantic City lights, main attraction
Slick talk, jiggy at the door, got the gat and

   (*Singer*) + [Ghost talking]
   [Yeah, c'mon]
   Oooh, you know that rhyme won't end
   [We 'bout to slow this down right about know and...]
   Makes your day worthwhile
   [...you know, wait for the drop to come back in and all that and uh]
   It takes your day that's sad and blue
   [C'mon baby girl, sing that, uh, c'mon, didn't y'all like that?]
   On a ride to far and move
   [C'mon, didn't y'all like that? Yeah, say what, say what, say what]
   On that dark and troubled sea
   [Uh, ma', that's right now]
   Ghost showed you the light
   [Tell y'all, didn't I tell y'all, didn't I tell y'all, didn't I tell y'all?]
   And now you're dancing so fast and so free
   [Uh huh, ay yo, hold on, I got you baby]
   They're leaving stormy skies behind
   [Check it, I run it back people, let's go, here we go now]

(Ghostface)
Yo, who got the biggest burner?
Ask the Terminator, Wes Snipes shit plus Ghost meets Vegas
Stage show magician, dip with with a bunch of candy
I got a lot of babies, y'all ain't family
If y'all don't hear me, y'all don't feel me
My album is bulletproof, y'all can't kill me
In 2003 the lease is up
We on the block now, no need for y'all re'in up
Pop your seat up, chop the weed up, excuse me if I'm horny
No doubt, I might knock the beat up
Florence style, all up on the set freezed up
All player haters get swiss cheesed up
Muthafucka if you with me, throw your hands up
Look, money at the bar, pick your man up
Me and Reese Piece is like diamonds in the rough
I need Viacom money, but rhymin ain't enough

   (Chorus)

   [Ghostface talking through chorus)
   Yo, Starks Enterprise, yeah, c'mon
   That's right, you heard, party muthafuckin people, yeah
   It's like that, straight up, nothin but the top, bitch
   Yeah, that's right, that's my shit
   This shit make you wanna go...yo'
   Feel-Ghost, feel Ghost, feel Ghost, now flow it, now back
   Hop, hop, hop, word
   (talking to fade)

   (Bridge - *Singer* through 2nd chorus and Ghost talking)
   Where do we go, where do we go, where do we go, go now from here?
   Ghost showers got you by the hour, holding you, taking you, blessing you
   Ahhhh baby, the showers</pre>
