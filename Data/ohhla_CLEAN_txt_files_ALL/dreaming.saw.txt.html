Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yuh si you
Yuh nuh easy, yuh know, you a laugh
Yuh know yuh nuh stop pressure mi dream dem though
Every night, I a wake up wet
Soak ina sweat
Yuh si ina reality, mi want a check
Gi mi a test nuh, Gimmi a test

I've been dreaming of you every night
When we made love, it was like dynamite
My frenz told me that you got a wife
If she aint around, then maybe I might
Take the chance just to see what it's like
How it feels to ride on your bike
What I got, yeah baby, it's tight
You will be good for the rest of your life

By all means
Mi haffi, fulfill mi dreams
If mi even haffi hustle like on of the regimes
Stake out, mek a plan, tek it to the extremes
One way or another, bwoy mi mus be yuh queen
Mek mi scream yes and sing like the Supremes
Wet all over like a flowing stream
Join in, yes be a part of mi team
Mi dun come already, wah let off a steam

I've been dreaming of you every night
When we made love, it was like dynamite
My frenz told me that you got a wife
If she aint around, then maybe I might
Take the chance just to see what it's like
How it feels to ride on your bike
What I got, yeah baby, it's tight
You will be good for the rest of your life

Ina mi dream, mi si mi self sitting on top
Riding the wave, til the love boat rock
In another episode, yuh attack it from back
Then we change position and move to head top
Some boy whack, but yuh got it compact
When you lift me round mi waist, wid mi two leg lock
Strong back, from the school of hard knocks
Come gimmi some of that, cah yuh know mi all strapped

I've been dreaming of you every night
When we made love, it was like dynamite
My frenz told me that you got a wife
If she aint around, then maybe I might
Take the chance just to see what it's like
How it feels to ride on your bike
What I got, yeah baby, it's tight
You will be good for the rest of your life

Mine mi haffi sen mi likkle thugh fi yuh
Shine up mi new brand truck fi yuh
Lock down the dance and club fi yuh
Re-open mi bedroom door fi yuh
Spread out mi Persian rug fi yuh
Den mi set a bubble bath and scrub fi yuh
Drive inna di club and search fi yuh
Den mi tek it same place and dun wid yuh.

I've been dreaming of you every night
When we made love, it was like dynamite
My frenz told me that you got a wife
If she aint around, then maybe I might
Take the chance just to see what it's like
How it feels to ride on your bike
What I got, yeah baby, it's tight
You will be good for the rest of your life

I've been dreaming of you every night
When we made love, it was like dynamite
My frenz told me that you got a wife
If she aint around, then maybe I might
Take the chance just to see what it's like
How it feels to ride on your bike
What I got, yeah baby, it's tight
You will be good for the rest of your life</pre>
