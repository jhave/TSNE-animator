(Intro/Chorus: Wyclef Jean) 
Delivered straight from the temple 
Hip-hop ya don't stop 
One o' clock, two o' clock, three o' clock, ROCK!! 

(Lauryn Hill) 
Well as an infant I was born into religion 
My mother called me back - this brother she forgot to mention 
Was just one baptist - me! The stories o' God sent 
His only forgotten sooonnn who gave his life 
to make sure that I would have one 
As I learned in Sunday School, he's got to care 
of who's ready to disrespect, my mother and father would be Taboo 
But as I grew, I met a Jew, a Catholic 
and the pastor just couldn't figure out where baptist fit 
Hastily ya paid me that'cha make me sing 
Brother has confronted me, mister (????) 
I get Jehovah, a Buddha or shall I call you Adder 
or though rich for tellin' me brother 
I just like to be a scholar on the subject called realogy 
So that's how I might figure 
why they call themselves Christians, ya still call me nigga 
And off to store a black hole leaves no control over thought 
I leave my body to see the pits 
go high when the physical takes control 
No communications with the inner stealth 
The prize is the up the wise, wise who has a spiritual health 
Now to explain they had the problems/visions of gettin' along with herself 
She bought a corner, cornered herself and becomes a mourner 
Logic brothers... 
(Ahhh, yo sister can Praswell and Wyclef get some, check it out) 

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean) 
Delivered straight from the temple 
Hip-hop ya don't stop 
One o' clock, two o' clock, three o' clock, ROCK!! 

(Wyclef Jean) 
Delivered straight from the (TEMPLE), I had no time to (SAMPLE) 
My cousin's name was (SAMUEL), I wasn't allowed to use the turntables 
My dad was a preacher, so rap music was your devilism 
And if it wasn't say: Thank You Lord, I couldn't listen 
So why you s-sneak to listen to DJ Red Alert? 
To check the competition, a DJ Red Alert goes berserk 
Cause as a young lad, I had a big rap pad 
Cause he who wanted to practice would someday be the greatest guy 
So I checked them as they flippin' sometimes 
they're not flippin', they think they rippin'-rappin' 
the only rappin' they doin' is in they room before they packin' 
You gained the world sucker, but you lost your soul 
(The devil approach you us, all you do is tell a foe) 
Life after death could be eternal fire 
So some get blunted but you're back all on this when it's all over 
Mama said that blunt was a stunt to the brain 
So some say: I don't smoke but on a sneak-tip he sniff coke 
He won the lotto but now he dies of an overdose 
While the bum he picked a hole to sleep he wanted a deep throat 
So ask yourself the question: Who's really maxin'? 
Cause some check in but don't check out and either Hell or Heaven high 
But to some Earth is Hell and Heaven's death 
So they predict to be Haiti's and kill till there's nothin' left, hah 
But I'ma hit with a gun, that's harder than all guns 
Mic check from the temple, check the Tech 
(And start the nuzzle to get wreck) 
Can I get a witness? (Check the Tech) 
Get wreck (Check the Tech), check the Tech 
(And start the nuzzle to get wreck), can I get a witness? 
(Check the Techs), here we go yo 
Well I arrive let me tell you what I see in my third eye 
Many die they call a battle, they got crucified 
Justice, is righteous, in the eyes of the beholder 
While the, younger the better but the, older the wiser 
Mama used to read in deep from the book of powers 
But the bird said the word was absurd, have ya heard? 
Knowledge - I come to teach while I increase ya decrease 
Some say peace, but on a street a .45's my piece 

(Pras) 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise me two things 
try all my cheap - COME!! 
On the nineteenth of October I remember 
startin' my life as a natural leaver 
Cause I lick one-two-three-four-five-six-seven shots 
While any priest here builds his church on a solid rock, hit me 
So feel the spirit comin' from the Heaven above 
(Ay, Pras, how could you be a hood in full of so much love?) 
I said: On every man chest there breathes a heart 
Hip-hop where it starts, I tried to master the art, come on!!</pre>
