Typed by: AZ Lyrics

And some man live his life
For profits alone
That very same man
He lives his life all alone
And the road to life
Yes it goes up and down
Doesn't really matter
As long as the music goes on
Hey mister collie man
Why don't you come round no more
Hey mister collie collie man
Don't you hear me troubled call
Hey mister collie man
Look i didn't come to disturb
You best not be come 'round here
Unless you've got me sensi herb
I never needed any
Reason for me to say
Through all them troubled times
Yes me love you any way
And the roughest path
You know the rocky rocky road
You know that
Life and love is a
Heavy heavy load
Hey mister collie man
Why don't you come 'round no more
Hey mister collie collie man
Dont you hear me troubled call
Hey mister collie man
Look i didn't come to disturb
You best not be come round here
Unless you've got me sensi herb
You best not be come round here
Unless you've got me sensi herb</pre>
