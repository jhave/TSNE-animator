[K-Ci]
Your body's lookin' so fine girl, so baby walk this way
Come to check out all my lines girl, sure that I can make you pay
Come and talk for a minute and I can surely make you smile
Then you can jump right in it, I know I've heard it for awhile

[Chorus: Jodeci &amp; Missy x2]
Girl I'm ready (Girl I'm ready)
To get nasty (Wanna get nasty)
Said you wanna get freaky
But are you ready to get sweaty (HUH! SO KEEP IT GOIN')

[DeVante &amp; Jo-Jo]
I'll make ya, sweaty
Girl I'll make ya, sweaty
Girl I'll make ya, sweaty

[K-Ci]
Ooh, I know you like to have fun girl, I know you like to catch vet
You know that I'll be the one girl to make you love the sex
I'll give you all that you can take girl, if you go all the way
We don't ever have to break girl, cause I ain't hit you all day

[Chorus x2]

[Jodeci]
You can come play for awhile, for awhile, for awhile
Girl I know you will sweat my style, sweat my style
You can come play for awhile, for awhile
Girl I know you'll leave with a smile

[Chorus x2]

[Mr. Dalvin (Rap)]
Ah, whoa, whoa, whoa girl I got ya sweat

And let me freak the funky body all the way down to Manhattan, uh
In ya thang, we jet, we out the way I'm doin' my thing
I hurt ya feelings so good ya might think I'm kind of strange, what yes
But anyway it's Mr. Dalvin on the case
I got ya drippin from ya ankles, from ya thighs, to ya freakin' face
We're good and ready when all ya want is sweaty
Let me run around the party, just like I be witcha dirty, uh

[Chorus x2]
