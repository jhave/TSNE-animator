Yeah

1 - 	How many niggas that'll die for you 
	How many get a quiche like the pie, wit you
	I ain't talkin' 'bout those that get high with you 
	Niggas know, if a red's on ya head, then they ride with you 

 	How many niggas that'll die for you 
	How many get a quiche like the pie, wit you
	I ain't talkin' 'bout those that get high with you 
	Niggas know, if a red's on ya head, then they ride with you 

[Puff Daddy] 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Well,  I'mma ride for you, would you ride for me? 
Well, I'mma die for you, would you die for me? 
Obviously, we all know you type of cats 
Let they man get struck, never strike back 
Stay in the street, seven days a week 
Shit get hot, you never blaze your heat 
Stupid motherfucker wanna play me sweet 
So I keep 'em on his toes, that way he never sleeps 
Bigger than the king and the Pope, sling no dope 
Call me anything but broke 
When it's on, I guarantee my team don't choke 
Want a war, you niggas better bring yo' force
And when I say we won't quit, believe this shit 
When I talk about a Benz, let you see the 6 
And when I'm talkin' to a ho, let you meet my bitch 
When Puff talk, you niggas take heed to this 

Repeat 1

[Mase] 
Yo, if you down to act, we came to scrap 
We beef '89, still watch your back 
A nigga smack me, I'mma smack 'em back 
If it lead to the guns, then that be that 
And lately, niggas that snake me, just make me 
Wanna send 'em heat without AC 
Thinks I'm sweet, taste me 
How much you really want it? 
Enough to put a mil' on it or your deal on it? 
This year Cancun, guess who I'm going wit
My own niggas, see I pay my own trip 
Make my own chips, I copped my own 6 
I knock my own shit, like I'm on my own dick 
My day be short, need coke, raid the fort 
I'm knocked by the cops, come blaze the court 
And though niggas die for, go on the shelf 
Disrespect and spend like a man below your belt
Me, I always had, so I never go for self 
Had thousand dollar bills with Teddy Roosevelt 
Better slow down, tellin' you now, put the dough down 
Kick your door down, surround the block 
Where you go now? 
Fifty shots spit at you and that is not a whole round 
Way I leave the furniture, think it was co-found 
Here's the low-down, messin' with Mase gotta go down 
What more could I say but hey, guess you niggas know now 

Repeat 1

[Lil' Kim]
Motherfuckin' right I'mma roll with my motherfuckin' dogs 
Bitches ain't around when it's time to go to war 
This shit here, nothing to fuck with 
I'm the same bitch all ya'll wanna try ya'll luck with 
Lil' Kim spread like syphilis 
You think I'm pussy? 
I dare you to stick your dick in this 
Chrome 4-4, inconspicuous in the 6-0-0, shit's ridiculous 
Speak when you're spoken to and only with permission 
Like E.F. Hutton, when I talk, niggas listen 
So don't ya'll be mad at me, cuz I'm the Q to the B 
To the motherfuckin' E-E 
Copped my CD, now all ya'll wanna be me 
See me on the TV, beds will dip in 3-D 
Peep the CD, chromed out and phoned out 
My shit is paid for, your shit is loaned out 
I gets it on, money keep growin' 
Ice fully glowin', plus I'm bad to the bone 
In the danger zone, I hold my own when the pain is gone 
Like a splinter I enter 
So why should I throw my blows in those
Do a bit upstate and take the weight for your troubles 
My nigga B.I.G, I'mma ride for 
But it ain't too many niggas that I'd die for 

Repeat 1</pre>
