Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Count it up with my boys
Ran it up with my boys
Whipping damsels with my boys
I'm still in it with my boys
I cover for my boys
Pass squirters with my boys
Young Scooter be my whole name
And all that so you know that
You ain't fucking with my boys
I'm in it with my boys
I'm living with my boys
And Mac can tell you
I can't tell, I swear to God
I can't tell!

If you ain't my boy
You need to get the fuck from 'round here!
Don't need you in my presence, nigga
I can tell who you is
Snuggle, that's my boy
You witness me for a couple of whole miff
Money, nigga, I ain't got no fucking record deal!
Leaning like a fool, point punched from doctor Phil
Take a good look at my eyes
It's all real
I look back at my life
Don't know how I live
Let my boy, D.D. back to street, he kill

[Chorus]

I wen with the same niggas from day one
And the loyalty over royalty, we don't care about that!
Birds don't fly for the flocking, yo
Every right or wrong, we be still whatever
That B.U.G. shit, I put your face up to discretion
My nigga Young Scooter for neffa
Split pack with the ran, no presser
A lot of money in our pocket
Tell the bitch there is no pressure
Now, you can say what you want
But it look so we making note to note
Two part shit, ain't making shit without my boys!

[Chorus]

In my whole round, wammy, and my boys stop for me
The little pricks, they should think they cowboys how I fuck with them niggas
You a sissy for a half a zip, my boy have seven guns
Keep it real but you don't know it
Cut my heart with my right hand
Take a look, 'cause you are on hell's road now
I'm telling you, you can't trust no damn fool, so nigga
You been black, no bitch, never been no bitch
If they fuck with you, boy, I unload every stick!

[Chorus]

Skeet it up with my niggas
Get richer with my niggas
Fish scalfishes for dinner
Well, you see, there goes the winner!
Take a rhythm with my nigga
With your bitch on a crystal
She got a leaving with clubbing, blow it like whistlers
I'm a hurt nobody
I'm a nigga rocking like a canal stalker
Screaming freak it, no, ride it!
[?]
Came up with my nigga Willie
Stay, you ain't my bro, we ain't gon'fuck, nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
