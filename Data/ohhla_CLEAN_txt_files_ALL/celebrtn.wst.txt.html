[Chorus]
Yea, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that, I grab yo ass

[Verse 1]
Why you actin all, shy and all
Why is y'all - lyin fo'?
"I never did this before..." stop that
What you want, some Patron? I got that
I mean, I promise y'all, you fine and all
And yo girlfriend, she kinda raw
But she not like you, no she not like you
Right now, I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talkin is gon give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of y'all
Right now the Louis Vuitton Don is signin off

[Hook]
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor sto'
Got some Cris' and some Mo'
And we about to let it flow-oh-ohh-ohh-ohhh-ohh..
Had some problems befo'
But see we let 'em go
Got a ounce of that 'dro
And we about to let it blow-oh-ohh-ohh-ohhh-ohh..

[Chorus]
Yea, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that, I grab yo ass

[Verse 2]
See you know my style, I'm very wild
And I vow that my child will be well-endowed
Like his daddy, and tell him that yo mama had a fatty
He looked up at me said, "Daddy, that's the reason why you had me?"
Yup! We was practicing, 'til one day
Yo ass bust thought the packagin
You know what though, you my favorite accident
So go 'head, pop some Cris-tal for my newborn child
Cause now, "y'all"..

[Chorus]
...know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that, I grab yo ass

[Hook]
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor sto'
Got some Cris' and some Mo'
And we about to let it flow-oh-ohh-ohh-ohhh-ohh..
Had some problems befo'
But see we let 'em go
Got a ounce of that 'dro
And we about to let it blow-oh-ohh-ohh-ohhh-ohh..
