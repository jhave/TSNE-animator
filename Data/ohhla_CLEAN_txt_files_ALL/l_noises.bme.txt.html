"LOUD NOISES!" 

[Eminem]
Life handed me lemons, I jumped back in the public eye
and squirted lemon juice in it, by now you just wish I'd fuckin die
But I electrify, get electrocuted, executed by
the execution of my flow too quick for the human eye to detect zoomin by
{*vocal scratches*} Gue-gue-guess who? What's happenin guy?
They told me to shit, I fell off that pot, hopped right back on that crapper and I
said fuck IT with a capital I, look who's back to antag-g-gonize
You don't like it you can eat shit, fuck off little faggot and die
You right back like a magnet on my dick grabbin at my
shit better get to the back of the line
If you wanna get your shot at me, what kind of crap is that? Battle, what kind 
of rapper would I, be? 'Fore I let another rapper think he's hot
I'll bury my face in a stinky twat and go ah-ladl-lah-ladl-lah-ladl-LAH!
Girl my head space is limited, ain't even room in the back of my mind
So I ain't thinkin about you, I don't got time, I done told you a thousand times
So how could I find the time to put an Alkaline 
battery in Royce's back and at the same time put juice in mine? 
Goddamn it, Slaughterhouse is SIGNED!

[Crooked I]
SLAUGHTERHOUSE!!

I'm a - menace villian, my pen is sick and spillin, my lyrics killin
Then I let you witness shit when it hit the ceilin
A nigga's willin to give the listeners the sickest feelin
Like mixin some Benadryl and penicillin then I'm fillin
a clip with a written, can you picture my pistol drillin
a million women and children when I'm illin but it isn't real it's
a rap, on the real it's a wrap, how could you possibly stop the apocalypse
when I'm atomic bombin the populous?
Shock the metropolis, hostile as a kid, poppin a glock at his
moms and his pops then he hops in his drop, with his iPod rockin his 
Slaughterish documentation of lyrics, I write with confidence
Write like a columnist slash novelist
I'm in this game to demolish it, establish my dominance
over prominent rappers, you poppin shit to ya opposite
I can spit ominous so spit politics
Now I'm Haile Selassie, Gandhi and 'Pac of this hip-hop genre BITCH!
... SLAUGHTERHOUSE!!

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Lyrically I'm a cocaine Altoid (dope)
Ability so brain, it's a no-brain bout boy (fresh)
Physically I'm literally a Cocaine Cowboy, wait-wait
Did I just go almost four bars without talkin about my big dick?
The other day me and yo' thick bitch had a great date and we ate cake
And then we walked and then she tried to jack me off but she lost 
cause she couldn't handle my Shake Weight, I swear
The irony of Ryan is I am bi-polar 
while I'm rhymin standin beside a BIG OL', big ol' white bear!
Neither one of us fight fair - you are literally lookin at Woody and Wesley 
in a movie where the white boy ain't got to jump, nowhere cause I'm here
Nigga I'm on fire - yeah, and I'm every bitch's dream
One, two, I'm comin for you; I'm a BIG OL', big ol' NIGHTMARE~!
Nigga this the Slaughter, step it up
I'll pretty much slap yo' ass and tell you to shut the FUCK up...
After that, I'll slap yo' ass again and tell you to shut the FUCK up shuttin up
And that's how you body a fuckin beat! {"Goodbye.."}

SLAUGHTERHOUSE!!

[Joell Ortiz]
Uhh, I should be the one that goes slow
Nah, get a stopwatch clock my flow, hit the button on top watch your jaw drop, oh oh
Dat's dat oh, yaowa - when I drop I go outer space
Black out like Darth Vader's face placed in a molten shower
Say somethin and get done proper, momma poppa pourin out vodka
Mama mia, Em pass me the scee-ssors, there's vee-sitors in the Slaughterhouse casa
Better jet boy go home, better jet boy G4 chrome
Better +Jet+ boy Mark Sanchez, Santonio Holmes, I'm NOT your any old homeboy
Just - sittin in the lab, pickin up a pad
I be spittin bad, I'ma get you mad with this gift I have
Little duck sufferin sickatash when the trigger blast
I'ma put your beak on your fitted hat
RRRRAT! Where the liquor at? Sippin 'gnac
Bad bitch and a vicious track, I rel-idid-ax
Slide Pro-Tools to both, so smooth I coast to the West like where Crooked livin at
New York is a piggy-back ride to the motherland, hold on brother man
On the other hand get down, I'm gutter fam
Gun-butt you with the +Eagle+ handle Cunningham
I don't wanna talk, I just wanna beef, I don't want a piece
I want it all baby boy, I don't wanna eat, I wanna feast
Stuff my cheeks with rough beats and shit you done weak, I'm the one, capishe?
Yaowa...

[Crooked I]
SLAUGHTERHOUSE!!

[Joe Budden]
Uhh, insane what they call us
How you married to the game but you probably shouldn'ta came to the altar
Every bar like propane for the sawed-off, you try to hang and they'll fault ya
Eminem, Mr. Porter, Slaughter, my sentiments eminent torture, all of ya
Feminine marauders, they swim in that water
Men will assault ya, +Tommy+'s and bats to resemble Lasorda
Kidnap your tremblin daughter, at least a quarter
I'm a menacin supporter, it's got a aura more like Sodom and Gomorrah
Normally somethin's wrong with me, blame on the quantity of the porn I see
And they pawns to me, when I fix the game y'all think shit came with a warranty
How the fuck they gonna stop what I was born to be? Corner me, shit belong to me
Two choices, you can get along with me or sit your faggot ass right there in dormancy
Wait, all he missin is heels to be RuPaul, ain't nobody that's real ever knew y'all
Second to none and I'm dealin with bums 
who's time never comes, now deal with the blue balls
You ain't gotta fear me but you respect me, niggaz who never met me
threaten me, wanna Gillette me, comin to sword fight against a machete
Swingin spaghetti like it's heavy, some said he deserves an ESPY
In a Chevy like Andretti, put the desi where his chest be...
