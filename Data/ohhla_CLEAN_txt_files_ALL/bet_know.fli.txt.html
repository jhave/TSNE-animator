Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
It's like fucking four girls on the 4th of July
South central niggas ain't never told you lies
I make 'em choose sides, OpM 'til I die
Fucking with that westside, nigga bump that TeeFlii
Seat is on recline, I told her: "say what's on your mind"
She calling nigga daddy, I'm finna turn 29
Know that's that balling shit
I'm on some "take-my-number-down-but-don't-call-it" shit
On my EML, alcoholic shit
Fuck that Ciroc I told her shake it for some beer
Her nigga disappeared when I whispered in her ear
Been fucking her for years but never took her to the pier
Fuck it, I might just buy her car every year

[Bridge: TeeFlii]
The turn up is real over here, oh yeah
You ain't never felt like this, like this
We can see eachother in the mirror
In the mirror girl, girl
I can see that you been practicing
On the way you move your body
Body, you're naughty

[Chorus: TeeFlii]
Annie your bodies calling for me
Annie your bodies calling for me
If you want me, Annie let me know
And I will kiss and touch on your body
You better know, better know
Beg you to know, better know
You better know my sex game is real Annie
Yeah, you better know
Better know, better know
Better know my sex game is real Annie

[Verse 2: TeeFlii]
Smoking with you Annie
You fucks with me the long way
You know that ain't no time for games
It ain't no time for games
Annie throw it back and then look back at it
And I'm gonna beat it up
Annie your bodies calling for me

[Chorus]</pre>
