[Genius]
Mic trippin, from rock skipping
Off the local brooks, not knowing
Heavy weight, throwin vocal hooks
Ryming off Apache, the Rza scratch thee
Records borrowed from Home Alone kid known as latchkey
Break beat fanatic, crates deep in attics
Forty-fives marked up, looped with static
Rap ring heavy, each link in my chain, trucks Chevy
Flare ripped from the magic lair, of medley
But deadly I merge foward, with a sharp spear
He must return now his flight departs here
Like Sittin Bull, I lay with my bow pulled
Arrow poisonous cos my enemy clip's full
Stay in the venue, with the party promoters, life parolers
Half the crowd wild, 9 m&amp;m holders
Apply boulders, smash your allied soldiers
Intimate footage roll off the cameraman's shoulder
Many-a-die for fame movin like Leroy
Can't be one and the same, nah it ain't b-boy
The decoy, scan this with high tech radar
Til my mic strike, leave a state-size crater
I came into this with the writer's block
To prevent a sudden shock, on a large flock
Clips are uncut episode, invinciable armor
I blaze one, once I struck the match off my bomber

     <chorus>
Adjust this, til its EQ'ed like never
Watch a mega watt bang spot, raise the lever
Its operation cobra, its over 
Control the globe slowly, the bold soldier

[Genius]
My rough cut metal tapes, quick to break labelmates
Won't hesitate to negotiate your table stake
First lesson came from the session, room one
From the longest awaited, but the strongest made it
Complex, complicated, compressed elongated
Homicidial sub-title, Wu claw banga off the ocean shore
Kid jaw, cut with the jig-saw
Intern engineer, vest on the youth
Make the mic booth bulletproof from sparked wires
From autofire, rapid from the verbalist slangster's gat
Two hit Tucker she labeled it gangstar rap
Unseen heard, struck the vital nerves
of some sort, courts got papers to serve
Still bang em in the head, just lead no eraser
One shot, no chaser, who gonna replace her 
You punch-drunk swingin your keys on your index
Showin off your Rolex 
Didnt see the joe text, you filmed it on bolex 
Smashed with the largest full finger name ringer,life clinger
