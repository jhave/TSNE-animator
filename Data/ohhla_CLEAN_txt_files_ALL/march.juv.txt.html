Get that shit that get the club started
Get the nigga b'd'd'd'd'd-boom-boom-boom-boom beat down
Do that shit

[Juvenile]
You live that life...slangin' that iron off tha porch
When a nigga blow, you hit him up with tha torch
You got confidence; you got your chest pumped out
Is you ridin' Lex? You got your shit plushed out
Niggas know your name...'cause they done heard it in tha wind
Niggas know your face...'cause of tha places you done been
Your family straight - Is that goin' for somethin'?
You got your lil' man with ya; he ain't askin' for nothin'
Get rid of them roaches - you got a Cash Money toaster
ready for war - you got that iron in your holster
Full of that fire, Black Magic on your tires
You keep all of your hoes 'cause you a liar
You're swolled up; you just come home from doin' six
You done blowed up, and you already got them bricks
If they try ta jack, is you gon' put 'em in they place?
When you cock your shit, is you gon' hit 'em in they face?

(Hook [Juvenile])

You're full of that liquor - you just met a little freak
and you're ready to hit her...up in the car (???)
You're feelin' good
You're makin' money out the ass up in your neighborhood
You 'bout ta go buy you a Jag
You're quittin' the game
Everything is gravy cause ya made a little change...
...from bustin' them niggas' brains
Ya like how ya live
You got...everything ya need up inside of your crib
Like Hennessy and weed
You're runnin' with killers - You got that green shit with ya
You're slingin' them pillas - You don't know nothin' but guerrillas
You got television...up in your Lexus and your Benz
You can go and get 'em...showin' up in twenty-inch rims
'Bout 187
You put a finish to your beef with them mack-11's...
...while your suckin' your gold teeth
You accept your lick - Look, you protect it like a man
When you got that iron, is you gon' slang what's in your hand?

(Hook [Juvenile])
Well, grab your 2-23's, and march nigga step

You full of some diamonds - You got your Rolie iced out
You're steadily shinin'; you're livin' in a nice house
You gon' put your girl...up on tha next thing smokin'
If she think you're jokin', is she gon' get a quick chokin'?
You could take a trip...to tha Bahamas if you want
You could turn a trick...with lil' momma if ya want
You ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Tha game been good to you, so you done retire from hustlin'...
...or is ya still doin' somethin'?
You tired of them laws...tryin' ta take niggas ta jail
You tired of them boys...cause you got money for your bail
You got a reputation...cause you be bustin' them heads
Niggas be infiltratin'; tryin' ta give you up to tha Feds
You eat tha best of shit - gon' be ballin' at breakfast-s
Tattoos all on your stomach and your neck and shit
You 'bout ridin' up in them Vettes and shit, and them new Lexus's
You got nothin' but diamonds in your necklaces

(Hook [Juvenile])
