[Verse 1]
One night, I was stressed out from the world
I wanted to wild out and make the next man curl
Fetus style, right at my feet, my mind swirl
In a pattern of disarray, yo where's my girl
Maybe I can talk it out and get it off my chest
Wash my body fresh, got dressed and left my rest
Put to my mouth a get high, my first mistake
How you see clear, when everything's smothered in flame
Anyway, I'm in BK, in the PJ
Floor 13, on P, giving no leeway
Cause any day could be ya last, for the quick cash
Caught up in the lion's den, but them cats slept fast
The Lord had mercy on a man living dirty
Chose me for his will, even though I wasn't worthy
Rap on the door, kiss my girl, crack a smile
Animosity flowing through me, just like the Nile
Proceed to tell her that I'm fed up, word, dead up
My pride is broke, though I walk with my head up
These backstabbing cats, with their hypocritic acts
They supposed to be dogs, but the going out like rats
Our should I say snakes, my burden is gaining weight
Everything is fake, cause one love, has turned to hate
Every since my loot started to rise, with my pants size
True colors materialize, in my three eyes
Now I see the whole guy, before I saw him head up
But action speaks louder than words, once they mouths let up
I'm lost, I'm looking for wisdom at all cost
The Lord's knocking at the door, cause it's jack frost
And I'm thinking no way, a Christian walk no dayz
I'm too smart, too much to lose, seeking my own gain
I had a good plan but not a God plan
He dealt me with a hard hand, I reached my personal goal, forfeited my soul
To the enemy for what I thought was freedom
But that's a contradiction when you dancin' with the demon

Mental purgatory {4X}

[Verse 2]
So now ya got jewels, fly cars and fast women
Forty acres house, ballcourt, pool for swimming
But even these material item ain't satisfying
Ya conscious is happy, but in ya subconscious ya dying
Ya try to fill the void, so weed you exploit
Smoking trees back like cancer sticks with Lucifer's boys
Or should I say ya click, ya paid out the box committing vic's
What's the math on that, it don't add, see actually it's sad
Cause ya spirit is weak, ya lack true wisdom
Ya might be ghetto free, but in ya mind ya lock prison
Ya slippin', ya used to smoke trees, now ya trippin'
Till' you comatose the drug overdose blurred ya vision
No plan for the future, so money is wasted foolishly
And you the rap cat in ya rhyme supposed to be schooling me
Then one night, deep in the cut, ya own boys pulled the shank up
Stole ya idols, left you bankrupt
Ain't no money in the bank, cause it's all in ya lungs
Ya went from here, to there then came back where you from
Another set up by the devil, another sad song like Aaron Neville
But God does his best in times of trouble

Mental purgatory {2X}

[Verse 3]
He's mighty, here come the day to set the night free
Whatever's in the dark he exposes so that we might see
Clearly, he'll strengthen you in the time of fear, the divine is hear
Gave me a new lease, plus unbroken peace
Eat nothing but the unleavened yeast, I'm breaking bread
Enough to maintain the many trials of the day ahead
I'm strong in the Lord, power greater than street muscle
We hustle with a free gift, his name is Jesus
Just commit ya life, follow the code of His thesis
The written truth, real life tested, believer proof
Cause when gathered with more than two there's no telling what He's gonna do
So what the deal duke, it's on you
It's on you, so tell me what you gonna do
Ya body was old, but then the spirit made you new
Renew, ya spirit with the bloodstain
Now in the book of life inscribed ya full name
The world wants my gift but ain't got nothing for me
My rhymes my sacrifice, no more mental purgatory
Some sheep get consumed by the wolf, son its gory
Thank God for the shepherd, now I truly see his glory {2X}
