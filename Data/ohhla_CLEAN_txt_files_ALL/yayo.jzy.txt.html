[Chorus]
Yayo Good Mornin [x3]

Were he still won't give my spot
Cuz I'm a real street nigga still stuntin on the end gettin mad cuz the nigga won't stop
Gotcha girlfriend actin like a groupie

You know my life just like a movie
Ya know Ya know Ya know Ya know now
Everybody know what the truth be

[Verse]
My triggas my struts thats all that I need
With all my money and all of my weed
Kill myself baby Kurt Cobain
And I'm thinkin bout changin my name to cocaine
Step up in this bitch like 1000 grams
Bout to leave this bitch with 1000 pounds
In a brand new Rarri no D8
All cuz I'm use to sellin a retail
Don't you just love how i put it in deep sale
Tell many phone I have until he sell
So here we go two nines want split
So break it up that about 8 vits
Mo bricks mo chips
Mo money mo flips
Mo bread mo bitches
Got a ziplock bag full of 42 fitz

[Chorus]
Yayo Good Mornin [x3]
I know you been here to owe me
Yayo Good Mornin [x3]
I know you been here to owe me
Cuz I see you watchin
As long as you know
That I get it poppin
I see these hatin ass nigga just on my spot
Were he still won't give my spot
Cuz I'm a real street nigga still stuntin on the end gettin mad cuz the nigga won't stop
Gotcha girlfriend actin like a groupie
Ya know Ya know Ya know Ya know now
You know my life just like a movie
Ya know Ya know Ya know Ya know now
Everybody know what the truth be
Ya know Ya know Ya know Ya know now
12 D's in this bitch like ooo wee
Ya know Ya know Ya know Ya know now</pre>
