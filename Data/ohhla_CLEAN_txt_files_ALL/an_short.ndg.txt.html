Another short story
When he be acting bad, don't he make you mad
Wanna kick his ass, when he already showed ya
He ain't no good and that's a fact

Another sad story
She constatly says she adores me
Girl I'm all dog in love don't leave here anymore

Another short story
Her love was beginning to bore me
It doens't take long for my love to fade

Another sad story
I only call when I'm horny
But she acts like we kick all day
It's a quarter pass midnight
don't he make you mad, you can't find his ass
Seven hours past, since he called you last
Only to you he can do no wrong
Funny how time flies
Especially when you live a whole life
Looking for love is already gone

Another short story
Already gave you a warning
A one night stand homie look what I done

Another sad story
This girl was so soft that's so lovely
I cannot stay cuz she's to strong
I keep my mind on my monay
And everything else is just find someone else to play her game
I like new skirts yeah like bees like honey (honey)
You can have some if you want, hey no kissing
Oooh no, another short story
Her love was beginning to bore me
It doesn't take long for my love to fade

Another sad story
I only call when I'm horny
But she acts like we kick all day

Another short story
Already gave you a warning
A one night stand homie look what I've done</pre>
