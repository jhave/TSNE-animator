Typed by: g-gomez@edmail.com

Don't hold back, just let it go, uhh!  [Do what you feel, baby!]
Let it out, let the juices flow  [Do what you feel, baby!]
Come on, girl, if the feelin's right ... [Do what you feel, baby!]
We can do it all day, we can do it all night  [Do what you feel, baby!]

It's on, one more hit, baby
Lemme see you get low and dip, baby
Worlwide, young and old, snap them fingers, tap them toes
I'm back with another round, puttin' it down,
Speakin' my mind and layin' it down
C'mon, do what you feel, girl, let loose for real, girl
Just move your body, rock your body,
Don't you worry 'bout nobody
Y'all fellas go on and get up on it,
'Cause you know she really want it
It's all about havin' fun, it's all about keepin' it real,
It's all about havin' fun, keepin' it real, doin' what you feel!

If you wanna do it now, girl, why hesitate?  [Do what you feel, baby!]
If your mind say yes, girl, why you gonna wait?
[Do what you feel, baby!]
We can do it now, we can do it later  [Do what you feel, baby!]
If you don't wanna do it now, I ain't gonna hate ya
[Do what you feel, baby!]

Dance to the rhythm, da-dance to the beat now
Break it down, lemme see you get down now
Who said the party's over?  It just got started when I took over
Yeah, now wave your hands in the air
&gt;From the left to the right like you don't care
C'mon, it's the one and only Freak, Nasty as I wanna be
Shake it up, baby, shake it down
I wanna see you shake it when I come to your town
On the floor and dip, honey, no need to trip, honey
It's all about havin' fun, it's all about keepin' it real,
It's all about havin' fun, keepin' it real, doin' what you feel!

We can do it nice and we can do it slow  [Do what you feel, baby!]
If you wanna go low, girl, then go down low  [Do what you feel, baby!]
We can do it nice and we can do it fast  [Do what you feel, baby!]
If you want it, girl, just gimme that na-naa na naaaaa...
[Do what you feel, baby!]

Here we go, with Lil Mo, freakin' his hair from back do'
Yo, people in the front, yo, people in the back
Show me where your heart is at
Just do what you feel, don't be ashamed
'Cause bein' real is the name of the game
Do your thing, please yourself, 'cause it's hard pleasin' everybody else

First of all I'm gonna please me, the one and only Freak Nasty
I tell you now, I never sneak,
'Cause ain't nothin' wrong with bein' a freak
And girls, that's me 'till the day I die
A straight up brother, but a lil' shy
It's all about havin' fun, keepin' it real, doin' what you feel, come on
...

We can do it like this, we can do it like that  [Do what you feel,
baby!]
We can do it from the front, we can do it from the back
[Do what you feel, baby!]
You can touch me here, you can touch me there  [Do what you feel, baby!]

See, a brother like me, I don't really care  [Do what you feel, baby!]

[Do what you feel, baby!]  (8x)

I'm on a roll, don't get behind; if you missed it, just press rewind
Do whatever, do what you're gonna do; whatever it is, you gotta be true
Gotta be real and do what you feel, be king or queen of your own hill
I'm makin' music for everyone, so everybody can have a lil' fun
I'm comin' hard, I'm comin' soft, girl
How you want it? 'Cause I'm 'bout to go off
It's gettin' heated, I'm about to sizzle
People to the right, even in the middle
People to the left, to the front, to the back
Do what you feel, yeah, I like it like that
Yeah, from me to you, just keep it real
(Too sweeeeeet!)  Y'all know the rest

We can do it like this, we can do it all day  [Do what you feel, baby!]
We can do it like that, we can do it any way [Do what you feel, baby!]
We can to it over there, we can do it right here
[Do what you feel, baby!]
We can do it in the ATL, or New Orleans, it don't matter
[Do what you feel, baby!] where we do it, we can just do what we feel!

Too sweeeeeet!  For life.</pre>
