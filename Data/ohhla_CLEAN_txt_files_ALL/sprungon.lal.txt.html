[LaLa {The Game}]
Could it be the way he touch me (How)
He hold me (Why) {Come on}
He got me doin' all these things {Black Wall, Cross Money, come on}
La-la-la {LaLa, west coast, come on}
La-la, la-la, la-la

[Fingazz]
{*scratching*}
"Fingazz on the track..."

[Rap Verse 1: The Game]
She ride around in the S-5, that's me
She throwin' up the west side, nigga, that's me
Everybody know that The Game a pro at
Knockin' down everything, where the weed, dro at
Live where the dro at
Roll it up, blow that
So I can get high, while you lean the 6-4 back

Refrain: The Game
And I did this all for you
All I ask is you rep Cali right
When they call for you

[LaLa]
(Verse 1)
It was a low-key Saturday
This summer of '03
Me and my chicas chillin'
Feelin' fly in my favorite jeans
When this Chevy rolled up
Bouncin' four vatos deep
He was tryin' to get in me
In no time, I was all weak
In love

Hook: LaLa
Boy, you never acting right
But you got me acting right
And all my real homegirls
Don't know why
And neither do I

Chorus: LaLa
Could it be the way he touch me (How)
He hold me (Why)
He got me doin' all these things
Guess I'm sprung on this thug
And I don't know why
He's hustlin'
He's ridin'
He's out there doin' all these things
But I'm sprung on this thug
And I don't know why

(Verse 2)
Sometimes, it can be crazy
Sometimes, it feels so good
And if anyone disrespects me
You'll bring out the hood
But it's all this back and forth
With you twisted up in court
Always say you gettin' right
But you just can't leave that life
Alone

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

[Rap Verse 2: The Game]
Just me and you, somewhere, with a view
With our chinchillas on
Like we were in a zoo
It ain't about sex
I don't care what we do
All the bling and the cars, I'm a share with you
And when it is about sex, I'm a tear in two
Fingernails in my back, pull your hair, what it do

Repeat Refrain

Bridge: LaLa
All my mijas bang on me
But they don't understand
"LaLa, we ain't seeing you
You always with your man" (That's right)
They say he ain't no good for me
Is this really where I wanna be
"So why's he in your life?"
I don't know, but he works it right

Repeat Chorus Twice

[LaLa]
La-la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la</pre>
