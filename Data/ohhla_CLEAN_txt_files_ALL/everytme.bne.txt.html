Every time I, turn arouuuund {*4X*}

Every time I turn my head, man
Somebody's schemin on a bad plan
Tryin to deal a nigga a bad hand
One after the other, harassin a Thugsta
At first they try to bring me in court for child support
Women deception and they lies
I'd rather keep my jim' in my shorts than save a hoe
I have to go and serve state time
There's always somebody talkin 'bout you owe 'em
I made not a dollar, you didn't sell nada
Niggaz ain't even grateful that we let y'all ride
You better be thankful we even let y'all shine
Every time I turn around there's somebody straight trippin
Hatin on a mission, fakin on a nigga
They always talk with some dump in they mouth
like Bone Thugs won't really turn it out
Go down like snitches, sheisty like bitches
They gotta realize that it's five of the realest
Every time that I turn arouuuund
Somebody all up in my business
Actin like you know me, I've never seen homie
He try to lean on me I'ma put the beam on him
Tele-screen on me, really if he only
knew that we split him like a blunt then roll him
Every time I turn around I see another phony
Thug haters really seem weak for the moment
Bone Thug niggaz never beat, we told 'em
Guess they thinkin niggaz was weak but we showed 'em
We on top it ain't no stoppin us, the suckas wishin we would go away
so they can flood the game with that garbage
I'm poppin 'em, stoppin 'em, any day they wanna get with Kray

[Bizzy]  Every time that I turn arouuuuund
[Layzie] I'm duckin haters over here, haters over there
	   Everywhere I turn they everywhere
[Bizzy]  Every time that I turn arouuuuund
[Layzie] Duckin haters over here, haters over there
	   Everywhere I turn they everywhere

[Layzie Bone]
Every time I turn around somebody doin somethin foul
I can't turn my back without these haters tryin to shut me down
Plot and I watch, strategize, but the clock
is sayin time don't wait for nothin, it don't stop
Crabs in a bucket make me wanna say fuck it
Like pop-pop-pop-pop-pop, but y'all lucky
Eastside, front to back, we guard that
Don't nobody want you when yo' ass is broke flat
Yeah nigga all that, we livin in a cruel world
It's rough in the ghetto but we put family first
When friends turn to foes and the enemy's exposed
That's when you gotta move on and kick dirt
My wife and my seeds dependin on me
to make it home safe with them groceries
How it's 'posed to be, they ain't close to me
Yeah I'm in association but I'm playin for my own team
Too much division, head-on collisions
is blockin my visionary skills
Get back to the mission to pay my own bills
Stay on point and I guard my own grills
Skills I'm possessin, in my possession
Why they wanna rob a little nigga for the blessin?
Who is you helpin, the world or yourself?
Put it on the table cause that's the real question

[Biz]  Every time that I turn arouuuuund
[Lay]  Turn around (turn around) turn around (turn around) turn
	 Every time that I turn
[Biz]  Every time that I turn arouuuuund
[Kray] Every time that I turn arou-rou-rou-rou-rou-rou

[Wish Bone]
Keep it thuggin green, nigga sweet, come get it
I wouldn't even take it if I wasn't gon' listen
But look here, this here, some of y'all garbage
I know you didn't feel it when a nigga didn't call ya
Keep your CD, save your money, it's hard to make a dollar
You wastin your time, swallow your pride, be smart
You good to take advice? Alright, nigga get a job
And a message to the niggaz tryin to sue meeee
You make me hate the spotlight
Cause I really wanna do youuuu
Lazy-ass bums, in-the-cut cowards
Back door pussies stretchin them undeserved dollars
I know you want a taste, I'ma bring it to your face
Bring it to your face, say it to your face
I hear your little chatter sayin that the Bone done
Smilin in my presence hatin on that Thug love
But Bone got a category, fanbase thug love
Hit the avenues, never done, let 'em know it
Y'all niggaz chump change, chase fame, earn mine
Within the right to take mine
Take it to the top with a dream from the block
Didn't believe, now they got they hands out
Make me feel bad with the weight on my shoulders
Damn, every time I turn around

[Bizzy] Every time that I turn arouuuuund
[Flesh] Gotta watch my back from these haters, cops and fakers
	  Come with the drama, nothin can break us
[Bizzy] Every time that I turn arouuuuund
[Flesh] Gotta watch my back from these haters, cops and fakers
	  Come with the drama, nothin can break us

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Every time I turn around
Somebody givin me the rules, a new ordeal
The cops harassin, shakin me down on parole
and put a nigga through the whole damn spiel
This kid lookin polished
No wonder I got a rap sheet way more enough to fill an album
Stack keep it full throttle
They lookin for the heat, that's why they got 'em, C-L-E my motto
Within the Lord I'll abide
Example of a good role model I'm tryin to provide
But every time they pull me over, it's like I'm back on trial
They tryin to catch a thug dirty while I'm ridin
You see a nigga fully rehabilitated
Back reunited with my fam, still we are the greatest
Broke up then we woke up (woke up)
Spoke up, niggaz got it together and made up (made up)
Now we got 'em jumpin back on the bandwagon
When we gon' drop? That's all they keep askin
When we do this shit we'll hit the fan
Every sucka that hated on they gon' get a thrashin now
Every time I turn around 
these biters tryin to take our sound
But yo it ain't nothin that can fade our style, my style

[Bizzy Bone]
Every time that I turn arouuuuund
You lookin over here, got me lookin over there
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derrier-ier-ier
Every time that I turn arouuuuund
You lookin over here, got me lookin over there
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derrier-ier

Every time I turn around gotta listen to the sound
of the negative crawlin all over the ground
Like look what you did, let me enter in your kiss
Nigga save me, suck my what? I'll kill your babies nigga
So the wicked was the corner place, dweller place
Never gon' eat that, eat that
Satan the original serpent on his last track
Flat broke, dead on his back, crawlin on his belly
Lookin for his celly, I can call the telly
L.A., Kelly, Rowland, rollin
Next my ass, I know you bitch
You gets no ass, goin down like Nelly
Every time that I turn arouuuuund
You lookin over here, got me lookin over there
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derrier-ier-ier

[Lay]  Turn around
[BTNH] Every time that I turn arouuuuund
[Biz]  You lookin over here, got me lookin over there
	 The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derrier-ier
[Lay]  Every time that I turn arouuuuund...
[BTNH] Every time that I turn arouuuuund</pre>
