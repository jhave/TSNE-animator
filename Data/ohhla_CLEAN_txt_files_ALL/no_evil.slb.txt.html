[Hook]
I'm so fly, like an eagle
Live my life, so illegal
We gon ride, at your peoples
See no evil I, we do or die

[Snoop Dogg]
When we niggaz, ever learn
That time is money, and money gets your ass burned
Learn from the niggaz that done it, before I had a chance
You know the ones, with the Chuck's and the khaki pants
Use to tell me all the time, bang lil' man
Took your advice, now my life is a paradise
Half of it, ghetto fabulous
Established, since 1992

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
Make way for the Dirty South representer, who next to be
I'm from the H, where these niggaz'll hide ya under the streets
I remember coming up, from on the corner with thugs
The only love that they had, was lost and scattered with slugs
Never ever getting caught slipping, I'm packing my chrome
Come at me wrong, I'll have these niggaz packing your dome
Asshole By Nature, bitch better give me fifty feet
'Fore my thugs click up, and hit your block fifty deep

[Yung Redd]
I use to sit back, let them old niggaz hold the spot
17, when I worked my first dope spot
Now let me teach ya how to stunt, how to hold a glock
7-1-3, I can't sleep till I see a knot
I'm seeing y'all gangsta, for the time being
You wonder who gon save you, when I'm not screaming
Any time of the day, I'll let that drama play
You can lay low, but I know where your mama stay

[T.C.]
Know how we roll, bitch nigga can't get away
T.C. hit your block, won't see another day
Still in the game, running shop still making moves
Running with Suga Slim, bitch bet pay my dues
