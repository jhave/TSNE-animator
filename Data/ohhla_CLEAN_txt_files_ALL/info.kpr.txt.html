[Killah Priest]
Information, no doubt, ya know, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Information, literature, thiefs on the run, where ya gonna hide,
when the truth comes down on ya, you have to decide,
where ya gonna run to, where you gonna hide, information,
when the truth comes down upon ya, you have to to decide
 you have to to decide,
information, we have to come with the laser scanners and shoot ya,
in supermarkets and department stores, direct mail houses,
were to record every single items we purchase, data about ya,
daily habits, and movements will flow into the b system,
from spy satellites, constantly searching overhead, 
watching us like we're squirting, a suburban 666 database investigator,
entire race heading for a cyber-space,
riots breaks inside an em-pire states, every move you make,
is recorded on tape, some of us are white,
prisoned behind gates, getting minature videos in a brief-case,
recording our every activities, indoors, outdoors, day &amp; night,
obscenely invaded our policy, our prophecies,
star gazing, because Allah's far amazing, than any greater god or for pagan,
raised in synagogs of Satan, awakeing with the starvanation,
left beats, scared and shaking, god with education, my birth was foretold,
from deep within my wardrobe, imbrase the cross-road, we once wore gold,
but now we electric probes with silicon brains, sinthetic, 
all faces are strange, pathetic, check the eyes,
a man can't even recognise his family,
I blame it on humanity, for this insanity, spy satellites,
the last data for life, theres no day or night, CIA,
take samples of my DNA, new borns, grow horns, placed in uniforms,
shipped off to the military, with they killed and buried...
active tv sets will be watching us, just as we watched them,
they will also report back to the beast at computer headquarters,
out telephone conversations will be automatically wire taped,
and transcripted by the national security agency,
honesty, modesty, poverty, famine, 
sons of Amman, deal with reprogramming, irus scanning,
breaking out of Satan's bondage, with long garments,
like we bionic, no longer paying homage, remember after 9-6,
we wear biochips, now it's 9 fuckin', beware of armageddon,
bloodsheddin', and beheading, head on head collision,
in the valley of decisions, we locked the beast in prison,
here ya gonna run to, where you gonna hide, 
when the truth comes down upon you, you will have to to decide,
where ya gonna run to, where you gonna hide,
when the truth comes down upon you, you will have to to decide,
when that time comes, you will have to decide, information, information,
you will have to decide, information, where you gonna run to,
where you gonna hide, when the truth comes down upon you,
you will have to decide, information, information,
information....

(Movie Sample)
Can you help me?, I'm looking for a man..
[a man, what's his name?]
Jesus, I must warn him,
[your too late, even now he's before ?]
they found him,
[He was a betrayed to them, by one he loved and trusted, by his disciple...]
