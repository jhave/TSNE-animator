[Verse Five: Will Smith] (*Elephant Man)
But oh wait, whoa y'all forgettin
When I was, amateur spittin before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Burstin in, passin out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you binge, ring the alarm
Let me see you clap and spin, baby come on (*Everybody dance and switch)
