[Intro]
Let's get it hype, nigga
Let's get it crump
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Eightball]
Pass me then Swisher Streets, let's get it in crump
If a nigga disrespect me I'mma prove my shit and dump
Blast rhymes like I pump, turn your belly to jelly
Veteran MC, I don't think you rookies is ready
Three hundred and fifty pounds of pressure to deal with
I run with suave, always packin' somethin' to kill with
Feel this bitch, when I get rich I'mma still hustle
Go down in history, paper taller than Bill Russell
Kilo flows, I got 'em hid in the basement
Choppin boys up, on some puttin it in they face shit
Eightball, F-a-t M-a-c-k, known for layin' it down
And doin' shit the playa way
Callabo's of the dough ain't no secret
Space-age pimpin' means I don't do shit free
Time waits for no one, it ain't gon' wait for me
Yours truely, signed Eightball and MJG

[Chorus - MJG]
All my hardcore niggaz, what you want to do?
My real thug-ass niggaz, what you want to do?
All my money making bitches if you ride with me
I'm a pimp till i die and I'mma ride for you

Now where them real bitches at?
Where them real bitches at?
Where they at, where they at, where they at, huh?

Now where my buck niggaz at?
Where my buck niggaz at?
Where they at, where they at, where they at, come on

[Foxy Brown]
I ain't new to this
Damn nice bitch thats true to this
Money ain't never been a thing to me
Always stack my dough, holla back (uh)
Ass fat, thighs thick, titties perfect
Inhale the cheese from here to Tel Aviv
Y'all know it, shit I don't bluff
And no dough? I don't fuck 'em
Fuck I'mma fake for?
Make mine's, I'mma take yours
Cause I'm no nigga like love before
Make bitch scream like "Gimme some more"
If a nigga broke, what'd you fucked him for?
Waiste of time, it's like we playettes minds
Don't stop, get it get it
Bitches, take it from a real motherfuckin' pro
Y'all get that dough, we don't trust these niggaz
They gon' pimp if you let 'em
From NY to the dirty south
And them bitches dime tight
I got my mind right
And my ice got the shine right
And if it don't blind bitches
When them lights hit the wrist?
You won't be stickin' shit
You be lickin' this

[Chorus]

[MJG]
I'm the pimp motherfucker baby!
Ice cold, stories so high
I pimp the whole village twice
So tight fold crease right on the president's nose
Pimp clothes, drinkin straight Henny and buckstrum
Touch toed, hoes take a centerfold pose
Break a treat, make 'em pay to enter those
Pros, slam those
Game tied tight like bows, we never close
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four
Hand chose bitches a la mode, gettin' sold
Plus a load of killer, as Chronic gettin' blowed
Keep it froze, tucked up in a Tupperware bowl
Stick of gold, somethin' from the school of the old
Forever flows, I take it down as deep as it can go
Burn rolls, braids tight, blazed afros
We're pushin' hoes
Dicks get erect like poles, pay the toll
MJG is in control

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
Peep dis, you them boys need to slow down
Up in the mornin' in court, it's 'bout to go down
There's no remorse now, better expose rounds
Them jackets be on the lose until the dope is found
Juvenile's my name, bitch
I represent it to the end, the same shit
Niggaz don't be wearin suits on these blocks
All you is is your boys in Reeboks
A thin hat to the back with a strap too
Willin' to bust a nigga ass if he had to
If you feel the same my nigga, you's a hot boy
Blocka, blocka, blocka
Better get off the block boy
Call the cops boy, your mama and pops boy
Cash wasn't a million, never hit the spot boy
You want props ha, you sold to the cops ha
You in a cell block ha, cause you too hot ha

[Chorus]

[Too $hort]
Where the real ones at? Beyotch...
Oh, you know how we feel
About all you wannabe ass ghetto superstars
Wanna be like "me ass" niggaz
Tryin' to be like Foxy Brown bitches
I give a fuck about your intermureal status motherfucker
You ain't nobody
We ben doin' this, been doin' this shit
We go way back with this baby
Talkin' about this real shit on the motherfuckin' microphone
Pimps and hoes gettin' money
Motherfuckin' clothes and shit ridin' vogues and shit
Nigga ridin' on twenty's and shit
Nigga what you got?
Brand new-assed nigga
You don't know nothin' 'bout this game
Come on

[Chorus till fade]</pre>
