[Lil' Menace]
Whoo
Yeah
What, what
It's ya boy, Lil' Menace
I like them girls

Chorus: Fingazz
I like them girls with the pretty eyes
And them sexy lies, who'd be down to ride
I like them girls with the luscious lips
And that caramel skin that driving me wild
I like them girls
You know I like them girls, oooh baby
I like them girls
You know I like them girls, oooh baby

(Verse 1)
I like them girls with the caramel complexion
Damn, apple bottom jeans got me on stressin'
Mami, wait a second
Let me look at you
Closer, your eyes shine like ice, and flashing like a poster
She's my rider chick
She's dressed in Prada, slick
Now take a cruise with the playa down the Sunset Strip
Mami, we can dip in the jacuzzi tub
Late night
Sippin' on that bodily bub
Mami skips the chatter, starts making the love
On the top of my Caddy when I'm back in the club
She's a ride-or-die groupie, gots love for a thug
I drop her off with more
Than just a kiss and a hug
You know what's up

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
My shorty's a princess, she walks around with just
A sports bra and a thong
She be calling me her Don Juon
Her fragrence is sick
Smells like roses and cherries
From her head to her toes
Baby got it goin' on
And I'm not lyin', my mami is luscious
She wears a coach pumps
And dresses in that Louie Vuitton
Has a tattoo of a kiss in the back of her arm
She a Lil' Menace charm so she could brag to her moms
Mami is tasty
The kind of girl that I like
In the summertime, we drop the top, and just ride	
Mami is slick
And ain't afraid of the dick
And like vanilla and ice cream
We make the perfect mix

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
Me and you on West Palm Beach
Soaking in the water with ya sexy two-piece
Mami
I love the way you move that body up
And down when you're grindin', you're so sexy to me
Listen (That's right)
The way we take a cruise
Under the stars
Walking in the sands of Malibu (Yeah)
The way you shine like a dime
A girl like you
Is one of a kind
Mamacita

Repeat Chorus

[Lil' Menace]
I like them girls
I like them girls, oh yeah
It's ya boy
L to the M
Fingadelic
You know what's up
Mami, cruise with me
Come on
Mami, cruise with me
All night long
Yeah
I love them girls</pre>
