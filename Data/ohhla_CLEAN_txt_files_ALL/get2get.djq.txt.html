Uh, to the top dog

[Chorus: El Debarge]
Get 2getha (Hi-C)
I said, Get 2getha (AMG)
Get 2getha (2nd II None)
Get 2getha Again

[AMG]
Everybody wanna know where we been, what we doin
Do we still like each other?
Bitch, we muthafuckin brothers
And it don't stop till the coochies drop
Bust a nut in a hoochie's eye
Now I know it's been around since you've heard from us
Class of '91 now it's time for fun
It's too much drama, go ask ya mamas
While I'm in the silk pajamas
AMG the Don Won Hugh here for rap
Lookin for the ladies with big butts to slap
Everybody knows my name, knows my fame
Game recognize the one the lies
Those with the pretty eyes, pretty thighs
City to city call me worldwide
Back to with niggas cus it just don't stop
All suckas come an like the pop, chips, rock, trick

[Chorus](2x)
Said it's all, get 2getha
It's all right, get 2getha
All right, get 2getha
Aw, get 2getha Again

[Gangsta D]
Tha D baby got G-codes
Gots no time for no hookas with that floss mode
My niggas tell you how we like to do them yoyo
Up and down side to side like them low lows
You know, I know, these bitches can't crack us
Once met a trick that wa sittin by the jackas
Now she blowin on a flute sweatin on my mackas
Don't get it twisted trick we aint no slackas

[KK]
Aint got time to play Hollywood Squares with your bagged up
The only stars high in the sky
And on chucks, you got that what, who, why, where, when, show me
Don't tell me, I know you got gum bumpin at ya mic tryin to sell me
Straggla struggling, wannabe baby have a nut jugglin
Haters don't you crew try to separate
It's the K, but aint nobody fade

[Chorus](2x)
Said it's all, get 2getha
It's all right, get 2getha
All right, get 2getha
Aw, get 2getha Again

[Hi-C]
Now don't be surprised I'm the risin one
I got game for you like Allen Iverson
You see Hi-C five years from now
Bankroll still slow with that platinum style
I'm an 8-50 pushin light skin, good-looking lieutenant when I'm in it
I'm keep nut gushin, Alize, Ice-tea, mixed with Sunny Delight
And I'm fuckin somebody tonight, aight?

[DJ Quik]
Now first of all we did it like we should now
So everyone can recognize we good now
Cus we done been click the click
And watch y'all hit
And realize that we started some proper shit
Mista AMG the most clever lyricist
Hi-C the pearl rabbit never fear a bitch
K and D from 2nd II None my homies from elementary
To the new century

[Hi-C]
Well I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find the Don of nuttiest of the bunch
But that's okay, we still keep it strive
We put the homies back 2getha now we down to ride

[DJ Quik]
Now we gon' dip dip da to the niggy nine eight
As we sip one to the niggy nine nine
And if you thinking about humpin with the crew ya through
We works that nana till the pussy go

[DJ Quik](Speaking over chorus)
That's how we do it
For ever
My nigga AMG my nigga Hi-C
2nd II None, featuring El Debarge
Now can you fuck with that, huh?
Oh me? I'm a Capricorn
And my name is Charles

[Chorus]
Said it's all, get 2getha
It's all right, get 2getha
All right, get 2getha
Aw, get 2getha Again
Still it's all, get 2getha
