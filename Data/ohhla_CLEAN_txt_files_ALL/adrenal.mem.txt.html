[Chorus]
We gonna rock the whole crowd
Come to your town, Smash the door down
Trash the whole room
Kick the walls in, night to morning
Then we do it again, its adrenaline

[Verse 1: Prevail]
What we spit, beautiful and grotesque
Swim with us in the abyss to the deep depths, take a deep breath
Strike your lungs like a deadly pathogen, let the assassins in
Loss of oxygen leads to hospitals, loss of optical and audio optional
But not optimal, octagonal, box you in stronger than oxen friend
Accidents happen I'm a phenomenon
Looking at me is like staring at the ring too long, you have seven days
Witness one of the greatest efforts we've ever made
I'm a heavyweight swinging like Butterbean
I'm a cut you clean, like a sub machine
Gun and run its fun to chase someone in space the shots I pop a top a bass drum

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 1: MadChild]
You better believe I got a knife up my sleeve
Tell your buddies you ain't leaving 'til you bloody and cleaved
Then by the glory of a warriors code
I'm a destroyer roll with a Bavarian heart
I'm territorial, wish I could look the door
Aggressive localism with my dogs of war
Small man's complex you only get torn apart
MadChild kinda like Napoleon Bonaparte
Fornicate with porn stars, sluts, and strippers
But only on the internet but what's the difference
Cause everything's a memory once it's done
I can be my worst enemy just for fun
We urban guerillas, got friends with turbans that's killers
We go from town to town burn and pillage your village
I'm merely concealing a weapon kept inside of my brain
That's why I'm insane, desire and pain, fire and rain
Sexy beast with an extra piece of ecstasy
So this can work effectively
Connect with me, we'll have a chain reaction
I'm playing the same game, I'm the main attraction

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Moka Only]
I'm carcinogenic; my chemistry's a little bit off
You tend to be a little bit soft
Well I'm off on my tangent, detective agent
Lieutenant who's medicine you left with abrasions
Face the day like a vacation chasing
Fun, sun, and money then its back to the basement
Feels good taking it back to the basics
Like when I was hungry run around in my Asics
S &amp; M was like the new cool band
That everybody be buzzing about at new stands
Who's then, you wanna know, a lose cannon man
And it began with the tapes moving hand-in-hand
I'm writing under chandeliers
Something strange going on like langdaliers
This is one of them songs you can bang for years
Adrenaline through your heart we smash the unaware

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
