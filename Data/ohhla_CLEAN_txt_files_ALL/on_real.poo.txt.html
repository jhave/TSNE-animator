[E. Ness]
From the depths of the sea back to the block
Loch Ness motherfucker representing up top
Nuts in your mouth, sort of like a gumdrop
Drum roll, be-de-de-de-de-de-de, I'm gun ho
My story unfolds right before your eyes
Niggas swallow my career then read between the lines
You never will appreciate the vast amount of time
that I put into my craft, it's more than beats and rhymes
Confined to a cell with a pen and a pad
to discipline the potential I already had
Took a crack at this rap shit, go hard for once
Too many 40 bottles of beer, too many blunts
As the days turn to weeks, weeks turn to months
Been sentenced, you knew what I was doing from the jump
Fell into a slump, climb my way up out the hole
Damn, Devil tryna steal my soul

[Chorus: DJ scratches]
"Now I'm the average nigga in the street life God
I try to beat trife odds"
"New shit is real"
"Now I'm the average nigga in the street life God
I try to beat trife odds"

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, I hear the rumors, they grow like tumors
But when you have humor, you learn to laugh it off
Niggas cast you off then they toss you to the side
I'm a backseat driver just here for the ride
Been sick and tired, Rapper been denied
But I don't care now cause I ain't scared of hard work
Read a couple books, my vocabulary stretched
I think it's time now to put my seeds in the dirt
Do a track here, do a track there
'til I attract the attention of my rapping peers
Got a few cheers, heard a few boos
Gather up some tools, time to make a move
Time to make news, put my name on the scene
Get a little fame, make a lot of cream
I'm living the dream while you all mad
I just took advantage of the chances that I had

[Chorus: DJ scratches]
"Now I'm the average nigga in the street life God
I try to beat trife odds"
"New shit is real"
"The only way I can escape is by vocals"
"I try to beat trife odds"
"Nevertheless"
"Now I'm the average nigga in the street life God
I try to beat trife odds"
"Nevertheless"
"The only way I can escape is by vocals"

[Jozeemo]
Jo' Mo cock back, squeeze at your cantaloupe
That you can quote, plus I'm fresh off the banana boat
Violence is in my DNA, what can I say?
And the game is the only thing I know, I came to play
Damn right I got dreams... "But dreams don't keep the lights on"
Fuck being wrong, damn right I got fiends
Yeah I rap but the hood in me, I should've been dead
But I'm still here, God must've seen some good in me
I ain't getting the respect that you should give me
So my attitude like "I wish a nigga would", hear me?
Drugs, I done sold that, blocks, I controlled that
Ballers wanna shine? Nice chain! Let me hold that
Usually I hold back but now you need to learn about me
Those who've never hit the bottom shouldn't be concerned about me
Non-believer number two, it's your turn to doubt me
Fire to the fuel, how the fuck you 'posed to burn without me?

[Chorus: DJ scratches]
"Now I'm the average nigga in the street life God
I try to beat trife odds"
"New shit is real"
"The only way I can escape is by vocals"
"I try to beat trife odds"
"Nevertheless"
"Now I'm the average nigga in the street life God
I try to beat trife odds"
"Nevertheless"
"The only way I can escape is by vocals"</pre>
