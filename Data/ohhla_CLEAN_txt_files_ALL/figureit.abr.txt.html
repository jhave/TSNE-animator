[Verse 1: Jesse Abraham]
Holla back if you can figure it out
Hollow facts make me bicker and shout
Although that's what we're livin in now
We're driven to be givin ribbons if we're fiction and foul
It's got me livin in doubt and my mission's about the transition of
wishin that vision wasn't a cloud
Of dozens of clowns mumbling sounds they built a pile made of style
Then it all came crumbling down
I'm wonderin now
I'm tryin to find a reliable, viable person who is desirable, maybe
like Lion-O, it's undeniable
I'm excitable when I try to pull an idol who rivals definable features
It seems I'm tired of teachers
Who scream, I am prestigious!
Obscene, highly egregious
Cuz they should be trying to reach us
Your genius is your weakness
Just be trust, and lead us
So follow back if you live in the now
Not talking twitter
I'm talking bigger pictures, ya know?!

[Hook: Fresh Daily]
It's on, and life keeps goin
On
Them light keep glowin
Strong
But what are we all here for?
But what are we all here for? x2
Holla back if you can figure it out x4

[Verse 2: Fresh Daily
Holla back if you can figure it out
This great mystery, what livin's about
I'm too old to be livin in doubt
The sky's the limit, and I live in the clouds
A pure spirit if you're hearin me out
No gimmicks in this human experience that we're livin in
For me it's all peace, no beef like vegetarians
You attain that frame of brain; you see how clear it is
Therein lies the key to what makes life mysterious
But really there's no secret
If need be, reach deeper
Me on each beat?
I freak beats and speak ether
Jesse ain't an elitist, and me either
So we combine rhymes and climb high to peak speakers
As lyricist our theory is finding answers
You ain't kickin what they feel?
You might as well be rhyming backwards
This human existence I haven't mastered
Tryin to define that line between cryin and laughin, like

[Hook: Fresh Daily]
It's on, and life keeps goin
On
Them light keep glowin
Strong
But what are we all here for?
But what are we all here for? x2
Holla back if you can figure it out x4

[Bridge]
So whatcha sayin, huh? x12

[Verse 3: Jesse Abraham]
Holla back
Have some challah, I'll have half
Hallucinations in Holland	
A holy holograph
Hallelujah
Holidays they all go fast
Hollandaise and halibut are all just but a hologram
I have a halo
It keeps me safe in case there's hail or hailey's comet fails and
plummets to the earth I'll feel a rainbow
I never say no
Unless they ask me on a game show
Are there Barbarians out in Barbados?
As a kid my mom said, You wanna play with plato?
(No)
Not the toy, the philosopher.
Why didn't you say so?
I ain't no plain old lame-o John Stamos gone famous
My aim is hiatus
I ignore an ignoramus
I excel like Chino
I'm a bambino
I could start a generation with the mayo from my juevos
My rhymes are like my babies cuz they help me elevate
I sell a brat then I celebrate

[Hook: Fresh Daily]
It's on, and life keeps goin
On
Them light keep glowin
Strong
But what are we all here for?
But what are we all here for? x2
Holla back if you can figure it out x4</pre>
