My, my, my, yes, I must admit
That I have never knew love like this before
And I adore everything about you
I do mean every part of
For meeting someone this beautiful, have mercy
I wanna kiss ya father
You're the kinda girl I wanna get closer to
Become the most to you like love is supposed to do
Cuz I fell straight into your trap
And since they say love is blind
I'm the Ray Charles of rap
And I'm waiting for you to put me in your mix
Because ya got my nose open like a jar of Vicks
I'll be your king, baby, you can be my queen
Uh, let's stay together like Al Green because

CHORUS
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today my dreams come true
You need me and I need you
Love in us is very special
Things you seem to do devine
You look straight into my eyes
Oh, our love was meant to be
Cuz our souls touch tenderly
Love is life and life is living very special

Well I must admit that you know how to treat a woman
Don't stop your love, like Keith Sweat, keep it comin'
And our relationship won't ever get dull
Because you're always on my mind even more than my own skull
You're always givin' me respect and chivalry
And I can't wait for your enticing delivery
Staying together is a must
Those tropicana drinks don't blend as good as us
We were made for each other, meant for one another
Neither one of us needs another lover
And just so it can stay that way
Yo, I'm on your side like Jennifer Holiday because

CHORUS

I talk the macho talk and keep my real feelings hidden
But what about that "pimpin' ain't easy stuff"?
Aw, I was just kiddin'
Cuz if we unite, baby, I'd do ya right
Well I hope you meant that mushy stuff you told Barry White
Because I think I know you well enough to be understood
Well let's talk about sex, babe
No, not that good
But Spinderella, yes, Miss, I'll still persist
Well since you put it like that Daddy then we can do this

CHORUS

I wanna give ya my love
Cuz you're the only one I'm thinking of
I wanna give my love
Cuz you're the only one I'm thinking of
I wanna give ya my love
Cuz you're the only one I'm thinking of
