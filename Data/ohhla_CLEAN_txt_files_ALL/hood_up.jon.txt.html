[Chorus]
Put yo hood up! (4X)
Put yo click up! (4X)
Represent yo' shit muthafuuuucka (2X)
Represent yo click muthafuuuucka (2X)

[Verse 1]
Well shake yo' drink up and spray the muthafuckin' crowd (2X)
Throw yo' click up and say it muthafuckin' loud (2X)
Now drop yo' bows on em' and get buck ass wild (2X)
You supposed to act up with a black and fuckin' mild (2X)
Cuz' them eastside niggas don't give a fuck
Them westside niggas is quick to buck
Them northside niggas will cut you up
And them southside niggas will put you in a trunk 

Now jump jump jump nigga
Stomp stomp stomp nigga
Jump jump jump nigga
Stomp stomp nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If you scared to throw it up get the fuck out the club (2X)
If you don't give a fuck then throw that muthafucka up (2X)
I'm wit my niggas in this bitch, and you know we fucked up (2X)
We clicked up 30 deep and we always strapped up (2X)
Who you wit nigga? Who you wit nigga? 
Who you wit get crunk, who you wit nigga? (2X)
Well who run this bitch? We run this bitch! (4X)

[Chorus]

Aye, check dis out I need all my real niggas and bitches
To look around the muthafuckin' club
If you see a nigga and he throwin' up a set and it aint yo' set
Or it aint yo' click
I want chall niggas to tell dem' niggas like dis
I want you to get up in that muthafucka' face
And do dis shit...

Cuz' you don't wanna fuck wit' me
Cuz my niggas in the club will heat (2X)

[Chorus]

We some eastside niggas (2X)
We some westside niggas (2X)
We some northside niggas (2X)
We some southside niggas (2X)</pre>
