I step in the club, and I'm throwin' up my set
Cup-Cup at the bar, and ????
I got special effects surroundin' my neck

[Chamillionaire]
No-No you don't nigga, Dike Jones just got wrecked
When I step in the club, you breakin' yo neck
You know why I'm here, to take my respect
You can't get next, I came to plex
So call up Dike Jones and tell him he just got wrecked

(DJ Michael Watts Insert)
Hoe ass niggaz, guess I gotta remind you
All them hoe ass niggaz, guess I gotta remind you
(Repeat 4x - *Chopped Up*)

(Chamillionaire: Talking Over Insert)
Hoe ass nigga..I tryed to let that nigga slide..man
Got respect for Watts and the House man
But nah man, hoe ass nigga, niggaz gotta get dealt with man
Out there bumpin' they gums, talkin' all that noise nigga

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
-It's King Koopa..ay
I got em' scramblin', I know he feel the pressure to cheat
But I can handle him, that hoe gon' show respect to the chief
He the King of Who?, King of What?, Sesame Street
I lay you out over some beef like some sesame seeds
Meet you half-way, it's like I'm interceptin' ya beef
Await on my front-lawn, like I'm expectin' ya beef
I know that Dike Mike, wanna turn the plex into piece
But I can't (Why?), I threw away my weapon reciept
I'm bout to get him, just when he thought Koopa was in neutral
Scrap or keep it on wax, don't matter whatever suits ya
I don't know Dre, but ay I wouldn't introduce ya
I drop a beat down on ya ass like a producer
Future?, nah cuz I won't let you have next
I bet he e-mail me and try to send me internet threats
Go and pop some damn X, go and pop some Zanex
Do something better with ya life and go and have some hand sex
You ain't bringin' Cham' plex, you on a pharmaceutical
What type of fool is you? I'ma suit you for your funeral
A bunch of niggaz hit me sayin' what they wanna do to you
Don't worry, I won't let em' shoot at you, until I through with you

Hoe ass nigga..shoulda known that nigga was fraud man
Niggaz was tellin' me that that nigga was fraud, and I was defendin' that
nigga man
Shoulda known better man, should seen it, should seen it comin'
Fraud ass nigga, gotta new name nigga, Dike Jones!

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
-Yeah!
Chamillionaire the biggest threat to any nigga that think he doin' it
I gave you life, but I'll take it back, before your through with it
I gave you plenty chances, but now it's over you ruined it
Swishahouse before you, and Koopa was your influence kid
You was on Tidwell, tryna slang me your raps
Got in the game, and then you switched it to slangin' some crack
I ain't a pussy trust that, it ain't no thang to attack
And it ain't no thang to react, the heater sang and go clap
Ain't no explainin' for that, you get lit up like a candle
Give you more then a sample, bet that nigga get trampled
Make that dike an example, kiddie clubs gonna ban you
They gon' have to cancel his show on the disney channel
He hated on Magno, see people never noticed him
he talked down on his boy to me, while doin' shows with him
Said the streets ain't feelin' him, how could you even know it
when you got your wack ass rap style from Nickolodean
Who? Dike Jones, Who? Dike Jones
Wrote his name and his number on the Swishahouse stone
Who? Dike Jones, Who? Dike Jones
Ain't with ya team but still the King of the Swishahouse throne
