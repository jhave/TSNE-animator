[Tony Yayo]
Big boy Bentley, big boy semi
Niggaz wanna kill me, ain't worth nigga pennies
I drop a bag off, and the uz' will spray you
I need six pockets like a pool table
These hoes love me, these hoes love my pimpin
They in the Phantom, clickin on they Cablevision
Dope, I got the Chef Boyardee bags
Coke, I got it runnin out the rehab
Hoes like, "Why he actin so Hollywood?
Cause there's a chauffeur in his 300 Hollywood"
I'm hot, no ghostwriter for the mic
Basically the Hollywood writer on strike, YEAH!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
She got what I want, want (uh-huh)
She got what I need, need (that's right)
She rollin my blunt, blunt (yeah)
Bitch hand me my weed, weed... {*growls*}
I'm so ghetto, I'm so, I'm so ghetto
On the low, I creeps, I moves with my metal
I be's in the club with my burner like WHAT
I done did so much dirt, I ain't tryin to get CUT
I'm a bad boy, that bad boy they wan' fuck with
They like that black on black rims on the Caddy truck kid
I make that hard white flip, nigga since "Get Rich"
My jewels so sick, they talk to a bitch
Like, get in get in! You and your friend
He sold ten mil' twice, he fin' to do it again
ALL ABOARD! Bitch don't miss the train
50 that nigga, fuck wrong with yo' brain, huh?

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
I don't pay for kitten, are ya kiddin? Well it's the kid
A.K.A., in and out your sister's crib
Mr. So Fly, I O.D. the stores
My car damn near fly, it got eagle doors
Before you see me off, you'll see hell freeze
You got a V-12? I got 12 V's
It's only so many months, you do the math
I'm a smoker, it's so many blunts for you to pass on me
Girl you crazy, got on B.B., rollin
And your mouth'll be, foamin if I keep, keep goin
You might see, me, frozen cause I'm holdin I done told 'em
If yo' game can't control 'em, then she's as good as stolen

[Chorus]</pre>
