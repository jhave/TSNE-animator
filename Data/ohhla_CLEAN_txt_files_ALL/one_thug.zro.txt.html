This is dedicated to the motherfuckers
That think we don't go through shit, just one thug baby

[Hook - 2x]
One thug-one thug, lord showing love and mercy on one thug
Cause one slug-one slug, you know it only takes just one

[Z-Ro]
Now if I die tonight, would you cry for me would you get high for me
And if you know who did the deed, would you ride for me
Or did you squeeze the shot
Jealous cause I put my hustle to the fullest, making it hard for you to bleed the block
That's what my father, told me
Take care of your business nigga, but don't rush it move slowly
Undercover with a birds eyes view, behind glass that's tinted
No licensee plates and expired tags, ain't no telling who's in it
When you get paid, get another piece tell me what you gone do
When all them niggaz you've been capping on, get to capping on you
Would you cry like a bitch, run off in yourself like a man
Or call on Jesus, when you see that warm blood on your hands
If the sun ain't shining, you better try to keep breathing
You won't make it to heaven today, you just gon burn and bleed
But if you a soldier, who gon fuck around with you if you mobbing with Jehovah
Either making weight, your houpe could be a Range Rover

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
I'm addicted to sherm, all my problems got me chasing a high
But I don't cry, since mama lift me I've been waiting to die
Looking at my partners when they talk to me, I laugh to myself
Fake ass handshakes, I know they tend to be bad to my health
I was a nigga that was down to ride, and I guaranteed
The enemy layed it down to die ran out of ammo before he reloaded
I thought my nigga, would do it for me
The nigga that shot me ain't the killer he was suppose to be, I'm still here
I know your name and your face, and where you lay
I know where your daughter, and your baby mama stay
Is it a good thing to die, and my reply is automatic
Keep your plexing to yourself, cause static could turn into motherfucking havoc
Jesus, I don't know who to trust
But give me a choice between real and fake, I'm gon know who to bust
Lord have mercy on me, cause I'm gon always sleep
If I can't find him, and his family fin to feel me

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
The world as I'm seeing soaked, I'm 23 years old and I've been broke
And I would rather conversate with killers, than kin folk
Cause If I know the location, of murder I can vacate
But I'm still down for my pistol, like a playmate
Nigga, even my girlfriend don't understand
Baby don't you realize, I'm homeless when it's raining and thundering
I'm bout to take my own life, but I'm not able to self destruct
But for the right price, I'll pull the ak off the shelf and I'll bust
And if you wonder why my pants sag, I keep my pistol in my pocket
Cause motherfuckers, want to see me take my last dance
But they can't catch me, rather I'm breathing or dead
And they can't stop me from reaching people, put me in the FED
Guaranteed, I'ma be smoking weed pacing myself
Without a change in my schedule, steady chasing my mail
Until my life is at the finish, with no more breath in my lungs
I'ma put these bitch made niggaz, to rest alas in the sun

[Hook - 4x]

How many motherfucking times, I gotta tell you niggas

It's a new motherfucking millennium, you niggas can't fuck with us
I know god damn well, you niggas can't fuck with me
I know god damn well, you niggas fuck with my nigga C-Nile nigga
Fuck y'all straight up, thugs in the motherfucking streets

Up the god damn block, know I'm saying, going platinum and gold
Dollars gon fold, my nigga Dirty did the track

We had to pull no motherfucking return nigga, we going platinum
You niggas could kiss our motherfucking ass, know I'm saying

And it goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
Till the motherfucking break of dawn Z-Ro, S.U.C.</pre>
