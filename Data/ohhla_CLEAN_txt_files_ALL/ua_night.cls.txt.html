[Intro - Classified - talking]
(I've been up all night)
Yeah (whoaaaa)
Mic check, one, two (whoaaaa)
(I've been up all night)
I go by the name of Classified (whoaaa-ohh-ohh-oh)
If you don't know who I am, listen (whoaaaa)

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Uh, I was born on December 13th (ha)
At 3:23 by Michael and Kathy (whoaaaa) (yeah)
An ordinary child named after my grandpa
Donald Luke Boyd, yeah the guy with the sampler (whoaaaa)
"Hi, how you doin?  Have we been introduced?" (ha)
I'm the guy you thought would never make it in the group (whoaaaa) (nope)
But I've been overcomin obstacles since I was two
When my hearing was an issue and they filled my ears with tubes (whoaaaa)
I never talked 'til I was three years old
Then I had a speech impediment that kept me in the cold (whoaaaa)
Talkin with a lisp, I guess somethin like this (this)
Now I talk for a living, funny how life gets (whoaaaa)
I never drank or smoked weed in high school, I was a late bloomer
For me personally puberty could of came sooner (whoaaaa)
I always seemed to be a couple years behind
But I'm comin to believe that everybody has a time (whoaaaa)

[Chorus - Classified] - w/ ad libs
(I've been up all night)
Yeah, writin to the beat, tryin not to fall asleep
(And I know I'm gon' get things right)
Tell the story of my life in the middle of the night

(I've been up all night)
Lookin back at how it was, reminiscin growin up
(And I've tryin look back at what I've done
But I know that I've only just begun)

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Uh, aiyyo, on New Year's, I bought myself a SUV (uh huh)
Then I got into a car crash in less than two weeks (whoaaaa) (haha)
I should have took my own advice, bought somethin cheap
'Cause my car insurance doubled just to keep it on the street (whoaaaa)
And damn, I hope I never fly again
I took a flight to Texas and thought I was dyin when (whoaaaa)
We dropped a thousand feet in five seconds or less
Now everytime I get on a plane, I'm a nervous wreck (whoaaaa)
Back to my childhood, remember Big Wheels?
When I was a young boy, toys were a big deal (whoaaaa) (ha)
We cruised big hills (man, just go for it!)
Smashed my head wide open though, still got the scar to show for it (whoaaaa) (yeah)
But I never broke a bone in my body
And it's odd, 'cause my hobbies were skateboarding and hockey (whoaaaa)
I never had nobody sign my cast
But you never heard nobody ever rhyme like Class (whoaaaa)

[Chorus - Classified] - w/ ad libs
(I've been up all night)
Yeah, writin to the beat, tryin not to fall asleep
(And I know I'm gon' get things right)
Tell the story of my life in the middle of the night

(I've been up all night, I've been up all night)
(And I've tryin look back at what I've done
But I know that I've only just begun)

(Ohhh, I'm on my knees)
I need to say somethin
(From the world with a smile)
(On my knees)
You hear that?
(From the world with a smile)
You hear that?  You hear that?

[Verse 3 - Classified]
Yeah, the first time I masturbated, I thought I needed help
It was dark in my room, I thought I was peein on myself (whoaaaa)
(What the hell?!) Yeah, I never had the birds or the bees talk
I didn't know the joy that could come from my dirty thoughts (whoaaaa) (ha)
At age fifteen, I started writin rhymes (uh huh)
But I think I told this story many times (uh huh)
I like to believe there's more to me than MCing
But I write to the beat and that's what I end up being (whoaaaa)
This ain't a song with a meaningful message
It's me introducin myself to you through my record (whoaaaa)
I'm that tall, skinny white guy, rollin up the reefer
See ya, Classified, very nice to meet ya (whoaaaa)

[Chorus - Classified] - w/ ad libs
(I've been up all night)
Yeah, writin to the beat, tryin not to fall asleep
(And I know I'm gon' get things right)
Tell the story of my life in the middle of the night

(I've been up all night)
Lookin back at how it was, reminiscin growin up
(And I've tryin look back at what I've done
But I know that I've only just begun)

(Ohhh, I'm on my knees)
I need to say somethin
(From the world with a smile)
(On my knees)
You hear that?
(From the world with a smile)
You hear that?  You hear that?</pre>
