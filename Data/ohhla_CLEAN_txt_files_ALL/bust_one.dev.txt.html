[Intro: Devin Speaking]
What's up girl? Ha, it's been awhile huh?
Oh yeah, I be tryin' to do a little somethin'
Naw, I can't sing, I can't sing girl
I just be bullshittin' man
I'm gettin' high
Ha, want me to sing somethin' for you, what you mean?
Okay, let me bust one for you

Hey, hey what do you say?
Tell me have you ever been fucked this way?
Hoo hoo, what you gon' do
When I shove this dick in you?
Hee hee, what do you see?
Have you ever saw big nuts like these?
Ho ho, what do you know?
Let me bust one of 'em and then go</pre>
