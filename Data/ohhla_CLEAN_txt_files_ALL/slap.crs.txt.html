[Chorus - 2X]
I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sipping on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slappin a nigga today (slap slap)
Slappin a nigga today
I feel like slappin a nigga today (slap slap)
Slappin a nigga today
Slappin a nigga today

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
This morning, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed (bed)
I'm sick of people putting lies in my head (head)
I don't really wanna work, I'm tired
I hate my 9 to 5
And I'm thinking bout killin my boss today
Killin my boss today
I'm thinking bout killin my boss today (it's just a thought man)
Killin my boss today (yeah)

Yesterday my best friend died (died)
Somebody came and took his life (life)
Now I'm looking up at the sky
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
And I'm asking why did you take him away?
Why did you take him away?
I'm asking why did you take him away? (why'd you take him)
Why did you take him away? (hey)

I need some money please (please)
I can barely make it on these streets (these streets)
Cause I got a couple mouths to feed
My baby's in dire need
So I'm thinking bout robbin a bank today
Robbin a bank today
I'm thinking bout robbin a bank today
Robbin a bank today (real talk)

Baby mama's at home and fussin' (fussin)
Callin up my mobile cussin' (cussin)
Always yappin about this and that
But she really don't be talkin bout nothin
Somebody take my pain away (Take my pain away)
Take my pain away (please)
Somebody take my pain away (hey)
Take my pain away (I can't take it)

[Chorus - 2X]

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Somebody just broke in my ride (ride)
Snatched up everything inside (inside)
Even got my 45
How am I supposed to survive
When I know that my stereo's taken away
Stereo's taken away
When I know that my stereo's taken away (I need my music, man!)
Stereo's taken away (hey)

Gas prices are way too high
Rich people are way too fly
And I'm where I wanna be in my life
But why am I so behind
Is it cause I'm wasting my time away
Wasting my time away
Is it cause I'm wasting my time away (too lazy)
Wasting my time away (I can't help it)

My grandmama's nerves are bad (bad)
And everybody in the hood is mad (mad)
Cause President Bush could give a DAMN about our ass
So I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say (don't say nothin)
Shit that he has to say
I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say
Shit that he has to say (woo)

Troops gone and we still at war (war)
Nobody even really knows what for (what for)
Even more I'm scared to find what the world really has in store
Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (it's not promised man)
Tomorrow's not promised today
Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (live like today could be your last man!)
Tomorrow's not promised today (hey)

[Chorus - 4X]</pre>
