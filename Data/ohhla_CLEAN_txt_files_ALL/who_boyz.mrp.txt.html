[Master P]
I'm from uptown New Orleans
Straight out the hood
I jumped off the spinners saying "I wish you would"
Nigga walked up on me mean-mugging talking shit (What!)
I don't know this motherfucker I probably done fucked his bitch
Eyes hella red I just smoked me a nickle
I ain't feeling this shit, I put my hand on my pickle
The nigga started steaming but I'm cool as a fan
He wanna throw 'em up but I got a gat in my pants
I'm throwed off nigga, missing a few screws
And I don't give a fuck about putting your ass on the news
And if you ain't from my hood, you know you could get it
We roll hella deep niggaz screamin NO LIMIT!
I'm a thug nigga, I lean when I walk
My favorite drink is that Incredible Hulk (Uuuughhhh!)
I'm a soldier and I'm ready to ride
We got beef we, we could take it outside

Chorus

We ridin dirty smokin, windows tinted
Run up on the 'lac this ain't a movie but this the ending
I got a nigga rolling with me name Uzi
We stop on the block and this boy ain't choosy
The first one we see better, break me off
And if your shoes too big, take the motherfuckers off

[C-Murder]
Straight gutter, straight rough rugged raw
Wicked like you never saw (Uuuughhhh!)
Let's go to war
It's dark and hell is hot, my chance is 50/50
If I die I'm taking you with me, so come and get me
In my chest your bullets will never hit me
I'm vested up (WHAT!)
Touching retaliation nigga that's what's up

[Master P]
We demand respect, cause ya'll niggaz rookies
Don't make us act like cookie monster and take a niggaz cookies (Uuuughhhh!)
No limit boys rowdy and we don't give a fuck
C-Murder in this bitch throw your fuckin hoods up

Chorus

[Master P]
Yo, tell Liberty there's some girl out here for her

[Liberty]
Who them girls? (Fuck them girls)
You know them girls? (Fuck them girls)
Who them girls? (Fuck them girls)
I know them girls (Fuck them girls)
Who them girls? (Fuck them girls)
You know them girls? (Fuck them girls)
Who them girls? (Fuck them girls)
I know them girls (Fuck them girls)

I'm ready willing and able to ride at any cost
Down to spark feeling I'm Pedo and I'm from boat
Choking bitches with their weaves I'm all up in their throat
I suggest you think about it cause you don't really know (What!)
I can care less about your rep up in the streets
I got peeps in the streets that'll automatic sweep
No limit mommies don't be fooled by the baby face
I'm not digging your man, I'm just thugging for Benjamins
So stop the hating increase the radio cake
I'm not, familiar with you why you trying to debate
I'm in a light green Maybach (WHAT!), mirror glass tinted
You better keep your day job you'll never be in it uh hah

[Liberty]
Who them girls? (Fuck them girls)
You know them girls? (Fuck them girls)
Who them girls? (Fuck them girls)
I know them girls (Fuck them girls)

[Master P]
Who them boys? (Fuck them boys)
You know them boys? (Fuck them boys)

I know them boys (Fuck them boys, boys, boys)</pre>
