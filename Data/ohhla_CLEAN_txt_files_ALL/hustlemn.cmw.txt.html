Geah
I said geah
niggas bite my shit
Ge-ge-ge-geah
Geah
Original
Compton
Fuck with me on this one
Geah

As a young black teen I roam the blocks
With the sack and cash rats roam to joke
Y'all know the motherfuckin' game if you got dough
Enemies might follow
Hoes for sure
Got to recognize fools since the days of young
I represent the Compton every place I hung (geah)
Y'all can't get with this gangsta shit
Low riders, greedy rats, gats to spit (hey!)
All day everyday W-S turn play (W-S)
On the corner how I used to serve fiends for paid
Y'all walk this way I got your order (got your order)
If Feds get hipped
I'll cross the border (cross the border)
Like the ginger bread man catch me if you can
One-Times too slow from the spots I ran
Run game low stuff from coast to coast (locster)
Won't never getting closed always get ghost, geah

If you need me fast cash - hustle man
Bitch all in your stash - hustle man (ge-ge-ge-geah)
No cocaine mash - hustle man
Gotta - hustle man
Gotta - hustle man (geah)
If you need me fast cash - hustle man
Girl all in your stash - hustle man (ge-ge-ge-geah)
No cocaine mash - hustle man
Gotta - hustle man
Gotta - hustle man (geah)

I stay sinister, y'all to shiesty
I make the money y'all ?? like me
Got hoes at shows tryin' to fuck for paper
If niggas fall and sleep than catch the vapors
Always on deck I got that work
Come sure on the cash you might get hurt
No time like the present represent the thug
Since the days of ?? and bugs
That means I'm old school ran the blocks
That means I'm from the school of hard knocks
Top dollar for this blow
With this gangsta flow
On the corner where I served ?? to sure
I givin' it to you pure
X-ray Compton till I die so don't debate it
Can I bang for the thugs? Can I kill you for bitches?
Can I blow a little trynna stack some riches?
Geah

If you need me fast cash - hustle man (geah)
Bitch all in your stash - hustle man
No cocaine mash - hustle man
Gotta - hustle man
Gotta - hustle man (ge-ge-ge-geah)
If you need me fast cash - hustle man
Girl all in your stash - hustle man (ge-ge-ge-geah)
No cocaine mash - hustle man
Gotta - hustle man
Gotta - hustle man (geah)

All I know is I like livin' life in the West
Guess hoes do fucked niggas bang the best
Anybody try to test best duckin' dodge
Tryin' to exchange where my ??
With on the floor so don't y'all hate
W-S niggas do regulatin'
From San Quentin now right causin' back niggas
Cross the state line tryin' to build they stack
We pack more heat, too straight with aim
Got that bitch that cheat tryin' to play the game
In the meantime in the twin time
Hustle for dollars so check the rhyme
I ain't with small change so I works the block
Either from China white or the ?? I rock
That's true nephew Compton forever
If it's money to make I'ma keep it together, geah

If you need me fast cash - hustle man (geah)
Bitch all in your stash - hustle man (geah, geah, geah, geah, geah)
No cocaine mash - hustle man
Gotta - hustle man
Gotta - hustle man (geah)
If you need fast cash - hustle man
Girl all in your stash - hustle man (ge-ge-ge-geah)
No cocaine mash - hustle man
Gotta - hustle man
Gotta - hustle man (geah)

Y'all stop bitin' my shit
Original (hustle!!)
Like I said once again my friend
It ain't over till the fat bitch spit
In two thousand and one ain't nuthin' spittin' (hustle)
But the Half Ounce Records
Geah, ge-ge-geah, geah
Full clip nigga
Fuckin' with y'all
Y'all ain't fuckin' with us
We ain't fuckin' with y'all neither
True thug niggas from the West
Do it the best
And like I said once again stop bitin' my shit
Geah, ge-ge-geah-geah, nigga</pre>
