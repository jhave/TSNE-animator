[Verse 1]
I ain't wanna be your woman, ain't wanna be ya girl
I ain't wanna be your savior, ain't wanna be your world
Just wanna chill maybe spend some time wit you
Wit no strings attached, is that alright boo?
You could do what you do, and I keep how I swing
We can link up on the under make the heaven's sing
But you, got to promise that you won't get too deep
The heart's already takin but the lovin still sweet
Embrace ya wit the facts and wipe away ya pain
If only for the moment in my candy rain
Don't complain about the time we don't spend
If anybody ask say you just a friend
No pretendin, no need to run game
We'll keep it on the up and up, they're won't be no pains
So, think about it let me know how you feel
You either with or you not, let me know the deal

[Chorus 2x]
Do you wanna, ride wit me
Do you wanna be, down wit me
Do you wanna, roll wit me
Maybe once a week

[Verse 2]
Couldn't nothin be mo' eas-y
Then this proposition here, believe me
What's this?, you seem slighty hesitant
But the body never lies and it's evidence
That you want me, I see you watchin my hips
A senstual bad boy, what you think gon slip in
Maybe get possieve, maybe pull out your clip
Try and, put me in check cause you addicted to these lips
Why think such, that's tommorow not today
I dissapear like dust if you ask me to stay
Come and play wit me, relax ya self on the rug, come lay wit me
Treat you like Don, long as you mind the rules
Might go on forever if you keep it cool
So come on love,(why you actin so shy?)
Tell me what you want the night is slippin by

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3]
I lay it all on the line, cause I don't like pressure
You decide, it makes it more on the lesser
I ain't tryna sweat ya, I just dig how you vibe
The way you play it back, but still keep it live
See I,I, i'm tryna to make it happen
I'm all about my biz can't have no man steady askin
"Where I been, "for what, and with whom
Why I ain't call, and will I be home soon"
Use to be all about love me back
Till I learned about the game and had to subtract
Distractions and drama they ain't fittin my plans
So you could be my lover, but could never be my man
That's why we could hook maybe once a week
Take a ride threw the town, and take a walk on the beach
It's so breezy, the way it could go down
Here's my number, page me, i'll hit you back if i'm around

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
