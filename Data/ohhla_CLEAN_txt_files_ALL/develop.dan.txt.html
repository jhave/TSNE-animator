Typed by: AZ Lyrics

"Underground intelligent hip hop development
Progression is our intent, ladies and gentlemen"

They say possession is nine tenths
Well we possess mind vents
To filter the rhymes sent
From deep down inside
Hence the precision and timing
Essential to rhyming
If you wish to pierce the cerebral lining
You see image is nothing
Imagination is everything
Is there anything you wear that's more important than what you think?
I think not... as I bump Aesop
Cruise to Herbie Hancock and fuckin' rock out with Snot
You wanna look for me?
I'll be in charity shops
I ain't buyinÄô my shirts
I'm buyin' my damn pants and socks
Bitch-what?
This shit's inside of me
I ain't riding the beat
It's the beat that is riding me

I ain't an alcoholic
I just drink a lot
And maybe I'm a genius
Or maybe I just think a lot
My intellect in retrospect compared to some...

"Ay yo Pip you know that second verse was all straight garbage?"
What you talkin' 'bout man it's not that bad... it was alright.
"I know what I'm talkin' 'bout. Give these fuckers something new!"
What am I supposed to do? What...?
"Come on man"
Alright man, how about this?

I remember hearing Mos Def rhyme the alphabet
I just sat there in silence
As a sign of respect
I knew what I had to do
And that's what happened next
I rhymed the periodic table to stay one step ahead
See in the periodic table hydrogen is number one
'Cause hydrogen is what puts the shine in the sun
Through nuclear fusion and when it's done
It leaves element number two
Helium... helium is the second lightest gas that there is
So we use it in balloons we give to little kids
Then there's lithium often used to treat mental problems
Beryllium don't conduct electric currents, it stops them
Boron can be used to make things harden
And that smoke that's coming out of your exhaust, carbon
Carbon is arguably the most important element
And nitrogen in the air is almost eighty percent
The rest of the air is mainly oxygen
And fluorine is the lightest of the halogens
OK that's enough teaching
I ain't trying to bore ya
I'm just trying to be a positive role model for ya
'Cause in my town I'm blessed with many role models
So many that sometimes the mind just boggles
See KRS is my teacher
Slick Rick's my ruler
Chuck D's my preach'
I'm just a preschooler
I've still got growing to do though
I ain't trying to fool ya
But compared to all the other kids in my class
I'm much taller
I'm much taller</pre>
