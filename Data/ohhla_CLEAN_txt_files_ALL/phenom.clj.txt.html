Ah ah
Baby girl was draped in Chanel
Said she love Tupac but hates some LL
Seen her at the bar with anklets and toe rings
She can take a prince, turn him into a king
I was looking at her in the limelight, pearly whites
Said her man get paper but he don't live right
All these emotions flowing inside the club
Do you really wanna thug or do ya want love?
She gets the paper when it's time to get it on
She keeps these clowns thinking like Jack B. Quick
Honey smoke make you click, feel it in their throats   
No joke all this love, let it stay broke out
Behind every playa is a true playette
Bounce you up, outta there, push and check
Taster's choice, have you nice and moist
Or play paper games or floss the rolls royce

Something like a phenomenon {*repeat 8X*}
(uh huh)  (go ahead daddy)

He was king of seduction, cop a suction
Now she was the cat that worked construction
Starve her with the paper, abuse the mind
Dis a new lover, when you know it's on mine
that's on top, lap dancin got to stop
You play out your chick cause your game is hot
I give you two, Italian, ice my whole crew
He's banging on my chest till it's black and blue
You beefin, yellin on the cell of my 6
You reach it then you hear the cordless click
Now your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin
Use my chips and take the next man shoppin
Hell no, must be out Chicago 
on your knees and your elbows each and every time
That's why I love you mami, you
Run your mouth though your legs over the bed baby
Work me out

Something like a phenomenon {*repeat 8X*}
(uh huh)  (go ahead daddy)

He was all souped up, but played it just right
Mami I was full blown, my game was air tight
I needed to switch up and get it in gear
It's a whole new movie, a world premiere, yeah yeah
Keep it jinglin, no more minglin
A brand new year, me and you can bring it in
I'm sick and tired of the freakin, night to morn'
Moanin in the mirror with my cubans on
Let bygones be bygones, no more games
Hope all the chickenheads go up in flames
Now we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back
Got it all figured out, mami I like that
Collect tips, cop his and her whips
The voice a quarter mil'-on, close the safe
But you're worth it playgirl, it's real in the field
Say what you want, but keep your lips sealed

Something like a phenomenon {*repeat 8X*}
(uh huh)  (go ahead daddy)</pre>
