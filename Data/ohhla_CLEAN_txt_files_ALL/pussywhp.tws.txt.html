[Intro]
Pussy whipped, pussy whipped, pussy whipped
P-pussy whipped, pussy whipped, pussy whipped {*whip cracks*}

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Pussy whipped, pussy whipped, pussy whipped {*whip cracks*}
P-pussy whipped, pussy whipped, pussy whipped {*whip cracks*}

[Twista]
Now where she at? (Where she at?) I gotta text her (gotta text her)
I've been goin hard ever since I met her (since I met her)
She got me actin like a fool for the cookie
I ain't even 'bout to lie she got some good ass pussy
So I - know you could tell when she shake that shit
Trippin when a nigga lookin at the lips
Cause I normally got that piff, now I think I'm 'bout to go and take a dip
I was surprised by the way she can make it twerk
By the way she can work them walls, by the way she can make it squirt (squirt)
I'ma do whatever she want me to do (me to do) if she want me to take her shoppin
Tellin her no is not an option, cause I'm gone from the pussy poppin
She give it to me good so whatever, as long as I know she happy
When I get up in the middle I be feelin every ripple 
so I know lil' mama know she got me

[Chorus]

[Twista]
She got my nose open (nose open) cause she a star (she a star)
Gave her some money and I let her drive the car (drive the car)
Cause she a fool when she do it like that
She can make a nigga bust and I ain't gotta fuck her back
And I - be lovin it how she get it wet, how she work it in the bed like a vet
How she got me yellin out "You the best," so I gotta keep her dressed so fresh
Her stuff is so good when you get up in there forever she gotta stay one of mine
I bet you if you throw that pussy up in there I bet it will turn into sunshine
I really wanna hit it, even though she got good brain and I know she give it well
But she got a bomb, and lil' mama's sugar walls be tight like a prison cell
Give me that good monkey, some of that good nappy
Some of that good kitty, because you know you got me
