[Coko]
(Verse 1)
Lately, there's seem to be
Some insecurities
About the way I feel
Where I wanna be
But you know, it's with you (You...)
No one can do
The things you do
To me
Never to be mistaking
Long as there's love making
There's gonna be some rain
Gonna be some pain

Hook: Coko
But as long as I know
Boy, time will show
Our love will grow
And I know

Chorus: SWV
Love will be
Right here
Be right here
Right here
Be right here
No fear
Have no fear
No tears
Love is here

(Verse 2)
True love, some don't believe in
That's what just I'm givin'
I'm gonna keep it strong
I will hold along
To you (You...)
No one can do
Me like you do
It's true
Sure as the sun is shining
Our love will keep on climbing
There's gonna be some rain
Gonna be some pain

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

[Rap Verse: Pharrell]
Come
Come slip and slide (Slide)
Into the flipside (Side)
Of the hipside (Side)
Now let it drip inside (Side)
Your mind (Mind)
You're not
Alone, you're with me
And the S (S)
The double (Double)
The U (U)
The V (V)
I'll be your bread (Bread)
And I'll be your butter (Butter)
You never have to shed (Shed)
One slight tear (Tear)
So honey, hold ya head, from the dumps and the gutters
And remember to be there (There)
I'll be right here (Here)

Repeat Chorus Til Fade</pre>
