Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro: samples Capleton's "Danger Zone"]
We at war (gyeah) {*3X*}
We at war
"Livin in the danger zone, in the battlefield"
"Dem who kyan't hear dem a go feel!"

[Sheek Louch]
Yeah, rude boy stand up, man up, chest out
Get the cannon, time to pull that steel plate vest out
We don't play around, cock back, gun 'em down
Chase 'em all around town, you hear that sound ("WHO DAT?")
Uhh, straight yardie
Me and the notty head, inside the party
Outside the shotty, inside the ganja
and a big ass fonta, music all loud
Somebody tell the DJ ("WHO DAT?")
It's a danger zone (danger zone) you got police
If not police you got some batty bwoy, schemin on your piece
We street runnin, big whips we crash it up
Hit the block and mash it up, we in the danger zone
("WHO DAT?") Let's go

[Chorus: samples Capleton's "Danger Zone"]
We at war (gyeah) {*3X*}
We at war
"Livin in the danger zone, in the battlefield"
"Without a shield"
We at war (gyeah) {*3X*}
We at war
"Livin in the danger zone, in the battlefield"
"Dem who kyan't hear dem a go feel!"

[Sheek Louch]
Uhh, North, South, West, East
No matter where you from, we at war with police
We in the danger zone (danger zone) we in the battlefield (battlefield)
And the plan is to keep, all our people jailed ("WHO DAT?")
I'm in London, yeah, I'm in Kingston, yeah
I'm in New York, yeah, bad man right here (bad man right here)
Get a body in my way, I'ma make him disappear
I'ma wild out, until I get the chair ("WHO DAT?") Yeah
Irish malts, rice and peas, wash it down with a Guinness
and put somebody girlfriend on they knees
We street runnin, big whips we crash it up
Hit the block and mash it up, we in the danger zone
("WHO DAT?") Let's go

[Chorus]

[Sheek Louch]
Uhh, yeah, you can pray to whoever you want
That ain't gon' save you, from the AK out in the front
We got AIDS, drugs, and homeless kids
It's a danger zone where we live ("WHO DAT?")
And even still, somehow I keep my smile
Cause my skin grew tough, like a crocodile (whatever)
I got a army, a posse
Sheek strong like the great, Haile, Selassie (bless)
("WHO DAT?") Come and try to stop me
D-Block my ear to the ground, my blood in the dirt
Anything else, just won't work (nah)
We street runnin, big whips we crash and tuck
Hit the block and mash it up, we in the danger zone
("WHO DAT?") Let's go

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Light it up, ha
"Livin in the danger zone, in the battlefield"
"Without a shield"
"Livin in the danger zone, in the battlefield"
"Dem who kyan't hear dem a go feel!" {*BLAM*}</pre>
