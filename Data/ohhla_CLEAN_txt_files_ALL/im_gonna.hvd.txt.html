[Heavy D]
I'm gon' make you love me!
Word.. word..
Word, word

Pretty lady, can I have a
Second of your time, in order to deliver
This message that I've been keepin
Inside for a while since you and I been meetin
Now, I've seen girls, in many different places
Some were fly, some with okay faces
But all that you could do was stop and glance
But you really caught the eye of the Overweight Prince
That day that I saw you shoppin in Macy's
Tried to track you down, girl you drove me crazy
Now that I got you, in front of me
You'll never wanna leave Heavy D, I'm gonna make you love me

[Chorus]
I'm gonna make you love me, love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me, love me
I'm gonna make you... love me

[Heavy D]
It took weeks, tried to track you down
Spent a whole lot of time searchin all around town
It's like you disappeared, without a trace
Then one day I turned around BOOM you're right in my face
So just chill, cause this will only take a minute
Sit down relax while I start from the beginnin
See I am Heavy D and entertainment's my profession
There's no stoppin love when I start my caressin
I can make your day, much brighter than the sun
And if you like good times, I'm the one for fun
I won't try to buy you girl with my money or gold
Cause love can't be bought is how the story is told
But I'll treat you really good, give you all of my time
And each and every day you will be on my mind
All I want from you is truth and honesty
You'll never wanna leave Heavy D, cause I'ma make you love me

[Chorus]
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make YOU... love me

[Heavy D - over Chorus]
Yeah you see what I'm sayin?
Y'know, come to the crib, say about 9 o'clock
And I'll have the filet mignon
And Dom Perignon CHILLIN on ICE
And when you come, park, y'knahmsayin? Word</pre>
