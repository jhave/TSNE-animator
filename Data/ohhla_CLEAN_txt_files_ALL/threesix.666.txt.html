Triple 6 mafia, mafia
Triple, Triple 6 mafia, mafia
Triple 6, triple, triple 6 mafia, mafia
Triple 6, triple 6, triple 6 mafia, mafia

It's gonna be deadly night
Kinda silent, kinda violent as we stroll
These niggas got ammo 
But I found out that's just way it goes
The Triple 6 Mafia be like quick to ride on some tricks
While smoking on mega blunts
Hoe we take care of our business
The Koopsta the Knicca
The ci-zap peeler is on the scene
The dizevils daughter
Gangsta Boo be looking so, so mean
Call up Crunchy Blac
Get the gats
Let them bustas know
That fucking with triple 6
Yeah you young bitches gotta go (triple 6 mafia)
The cali the hundred
The tricks I wanted I bucked down
The killa man D.J Paul
The G with a evil frown
These niggas be talking shit
'Bout who and who they don't like
These pimp hating bitches gonna make a player 
Just take their life (triple 6 mafia)
Scarecrow is the nigga
The mystic nigga that so damn slick
A natural born killa
With no remorse on a funky bitch
The juice man be quicker
But with them things he'll be dropping ya
Ya bustas can't stand a chance 
(triple, triple, triple 6, triple 6 mafia, mafia) 
Triple 6 Mafia

Triple, triple 6 mafia, mafia
Triple 6, triple, triple 6 mafia, mafia
Triple, triple 6 mafia
Triple 6 mafia, triple 6, triple 6, triple 6, triple 6
triple 6 mafia...</pre>
