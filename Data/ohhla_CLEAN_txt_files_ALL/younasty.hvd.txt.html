[Heavy D]
Aiyyo Water's back, quarterback, thought of as a fat cat
I brought her that, slaughter that, trust that, I rush dat
Don divas dice game fevers and up
Malibu Sea Breeze in the cup, what what?
D the Dean, D the Don, Waterbed.com
Perignon Dom, hotter than Prada; hot now, hotter tomorrow
Hot as Nevada - Las Vegas
Lost wages then I shook it off
Strip club why don'tcha take it off, and then I break 'em off
Then I'm takin off, y'all know me
Low key, stogie
Brim tilt, shirt silk, screw milk, got Water?
Well you oughta - you heard me?  You oughta

You nasty Hev, you nasty

Go 'head baby
Go 'head baby!
Yo, go' head baby!
Aiyyo, go 'head baby!

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Heavy D]
Toss Cognac, the boss on dat, spit semi-'matic
Pimp habits, mack status
Black fabric, black magic, rap magic
Rap logic, Diggy got it, check D
On CD, now you fiend me
Big screen TV, now you see me, plush livin
Touch women - phenomenal flow
Bahamas with a momma to go, fantastic
Money stretch like elastic, wreak havoc
Chicks who speak arabic, latin and such
With the satin to touch
They brag about us, mad about us
Uh-huh uh-huh, we toss it up, c'mon

[repeat in background 4X]
You nasty Hev, you nasty

[Heavy D - over background]
Go 'head baby
Go 'head baby!
C'mon go' head baby!
Aiyyo, go 'head baby!

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Heavy D]
Black Rover, black Casanova, black on black Benz
Black upholstered, black chaffeur
With a black holster and chrome burner, head turner, head getter
Who better, new cheddar, handlin, chain danglin
New York to England it's D again they diggin me again
See me win again, hot like sun, bust like gun
Crush like Pun, rush this one
Trust me son, they lust this one, that's why they come/cum
Dame hitter, pretty thug nigga, flame spitter
Many loved by nigga, popular figure, stop 'em with glitter
Shock 'em with heat, rockin your Jeep
Rock 'em to sleep, Diggy unique, y'all hear me speak?

[repeat in background 4X]
You nasty Hev, you nasty

Tch, go 'head baby
Yo, go 'head baby!
C'mon, go' head baby!
Aiyyo, go 'head baby!

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Heavy D w/ background again] w/ ad libs + [Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Heavy D]
Go 'head baby
Go 'head baby!!
Go 'head baby
Go 'head baby!
You, can't, stop, me
Y'all, can't, stop, me
Never, gonna, die...</pre>
