[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
General I salute you
I put a hole in any nigga tryin' to shoot you
It ain't nothin' cause loyalty's what I'm used to
And what I don't do I'll have one of my troops do
Nigga we'll kill you
 
[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm ready for combat, a soldier on the front lines
Take it to the streets nigga mothafucker punch line
It only take one time for you to send a death threat
And watch these bullets have that ass singin' like Keith Sweat
You ain't met me yet, I been camouflaged in the bushes
And I'm co-signin 50 cause them niggas all pussy
Bustin' shots at ya convoy, you don't want war
No surrender, no retreat, this is Vietnam boy
Check my war wounds, I done took a couple for the team
Only niggas that been on the battlefield know what I mean
Take cover, we comin' pullin' pins out of grenades
You won't make it to the General without gettin' sprayed
Might as well say hello to my brand new little friend
Only time he come out to put holes in grown men
You can send your troops and get 'em all blown back
Walk up on 'em wit a deuce deuce, and nigga hold that
 
[Chorus: x2]
 
[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Look nigga, I suggest you go home
Cause I won't hesitate to let the chrome touch ya
Nigga I'm never scared like Bone Crusher
Stand alone, provide my own supper
Tell ya baby momma stop comin' around here or I'm gon' fuck her
We'll try to take up for them lames around you
He'll get shots for free like I flagrant fouled you
I'm on the road blowin' grade A haze and brown
Got niggas runnin' like the KKK's around
My album's comin', a new year's approachin'
My buzz gettin' bigger, a few ears is open
Can your team play in the game, without you here to coach 'em
There's a very fine line between a boo and a ocean
Sometimes I'm in Atlanta where the big head bounce
And you could come, but after you give Banks head bounce
These niggas really want war, cause if so put on your vest
Cause all you gotta do is just say yes
 
[Chorus: x2]
 
[50 Cent Talking]
G-Unit's like the Firm
Cause you can get in, you can't get out

[Tony Yayo Talking]
This is G-Unit life right here, know what I'm sayin'
We used to sell drugs, you know bust guns and all the other
Now we're laid back, now we doin' us, we live it up
50 got us right, got us kicked up right now</pre>
