Song:   2 Screws Loose
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Them niggaz is gangsters, them niggaz is Shady
Them niggaz got screws loose, them niggaz is crazy
Walk around with they boots loose, tuckin 380's
Standin in the trap screamin fuck you pay me

[Verse One]
Nigga I'm one-seven-five wet, movin like Deebo
Boxcutter like a nigga work at Home Depot
Rep for my people, a big Desert Eagle
Shootin at your bucket like a Marbury free throw
Bitches get nothin, zilch I mean zero
Tommy gun sprayed at them niggaz playin hero
Niggaz in the hood don't peep through no peephole
Cameras and motion scanners, try to creep hoe
Most of us iced out, some don't even rock jewels
They in the club for a purpose, and that's to bang the tool
Street smart, I'm far from that college dude
Love gettin good brains, bitches give me knowledge fool
It don't take much, a little weed and the dutch
Couple sips of that Remy, now she wanna fuck
Hoes see a nigga chain swingin wanna touch
Rocks used to be cubed up, now my shit is crushed

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
My pack came in, I want seventeen-five for 'em
Bricks go down when you get more than five on 'em
Packin down to eight, I was holdin that 'tel down
2006 and now we're breakin them bells down
Gucci you the shit, least that what they told me
Catch me in the 6 a nigga right where the show be
I fronted you a nine so five what you owe me
If you don't pay me then it's back to the old me
Cocallina same color the snow be
Haters get found in the Okefenokee
You trap that's cool, I trap to school
I'm trappin boo, but I'm rappin too
Not a role model, hit that purp'
I'm not a role model little shorty hittin up turf
I'm not a role model, hit that purp'
I'm not a role model young nigga cook that work

[Chorus] - to fade</pre>
