Where we at, where we at, M-F-C
M-F-C (for what son) for life
For life nigga, word up
Word up, Brick city (Brooklyn)
Where we at (ha ha)

[Hardcore]
These niggas got me fuckin crazy bitches
So I keep a ton of hats
Chillin wit these willies then I get them for they snaps
See them on the T.V. popin this and popin that
[Starang]
Don't say nothin when you see me I'ma pop a fuckin cap
[Hardcore]
In that ass wit the hash for the splif so I can twist it
M-F-C weed and hennessy packin biscuits
Brand new Jesus on my feet in a benz lifted
Fuckin wit Starang hollarin at all the bitches

[Starang]
Look at these assholes, made me cut off my afro
Blow up the spot, make shit hot like tabasco
Ay yo, I roped these bitches as if a nigga had a lasso
It's classical, snatchin jewels then I smash you
Ay yo, niggas wanna know why I act this way
I don't know, been like that since back in the day
[Hardcore]
Ay yo, pick a spot and my man Starang'll lick a shot
[Starang]
Yo, disagree or say I think not, they got it
(And it's on)

(chorus)
[Starang]
Yo, Dog and Hennyville
Feel the same way I feel
They wanna kill, then I kill
We all got whips
So when they peel, then I peel
[Henny]
It's like that, I suppose
Smokin tons of weed
L-B's of cocoa
My man D, yo and Will
Feel the same way I feel
When I kill, then they kill
We all got whips
So when I peel, then they peel
[Starang]
It's like that, I suppose
In GS three O-O's, hollarin at the hoes

[Top Dog]
Yo, I'm head strong, because I go head on
Wit any fool
Who try to test the O-G, you dead wrong (you dead wrong)
You been lead on, you stupid, you dead arm
Anyway, who's this minny man talkin
Thinkin he can keep walkin in this day and time
Didn't he know Big Kahuna, plus actions in nam
Ready to begin, put all the bullshit to an end
Put it down for Brooklyn, ain't no room for frontin
Makin mad moves in A-T-L, can't you tell
O-G-C's and Doc smokin these fat ass L's
Oh well, can you catch the sense a million breeze
Is it cocoa trees, or is it the green weed
Roll it up, ten seconds now smoke it up
Hold up, don't choke it up, I think you smoked enough
Lyin through ya teeth, sayin we have beef
Now you wanna shake my hand and smoke on my leaf

(chorus)

[Louieville Sluggah]
Son I be all in, for it, now I move forward
G-C's tourin, top dollar for it
Can't ignore it, send all my niggas all over
Don't like it, so at best you scoot over
Or get ran over
Ville out of sight like ??
Knockin at ya door like Jahova
Beast come in, son let me in
Pack it in like Mexicans, for next of kin
If any foot step in I'm throwin lefts to chins
Now any questions, no, so let's begin
I bust this shit
Get up on a track, then split on to the next gig
Hearin Pac say hold ya head
Mad shit gonna change, just stay arranged
At it all day like Pinky and The Brain
Maintain our composure and then we roast ya
And have our niggas screamin out ESHKOSHKA

(chorus)
[Starang]
My Heltah Skeltah niggas
[Henny]
Feel the same way we feel
[Starang]
They wanna kill
[Henny]
When we kill
[Starang]
We all got whips, so when they peel
[Henny]
Then we peel
[Starang]
Heltah Skeltah, word up
M-F-C for life
And all my motherfuckin niggas, where you want it
Ay yo, my Owtlaw niggas
[Henny]
Feel the same way we feel
[Starang]
They wanna kill
[Henny]
When we kill
[Starang]
We all got whips, so when they peel
[Henny]
Then we peel
[Starang]
Owtlawz, west side, word up (word up)
Till we die (word up)
My dirty south niggas
[Henny]
Feel the same way we feel
[Starang]
They wanna kill
[Henny]
When we kill
[Starang]
We all got whips, so when they peel
[Henny]
Then we peel
[Starang]
My dirty south niggas
Goodie Mob, Outcast, word up, word up, M-F-C
And to my M-F-C niggas
[Henny]
Feel the same way we feel
[Starang]
They wanna kill
[Henny]
When we kill
[Starang]
We all got whips, so when they peel
[Henny]
Then we peel
[Starang]
M-F-C, for life (M-F-C, M-F-C)
Word up, word up
(Starang, Louieville and Top Dog chattering as music fades)</pre>
