Song:   Hope for a Higher Power
Typed by: Pudge2k1@yahoo.com

(Chorus)
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo what about you   (x2)

(Verse 1)
Grandma told me the good book said
in the last days get ready for the ten plagues
1st the rivers will be ran with red
2, 3, and 4 dead frogs will cause lice and flies
sick livestock is 5 the living they must fight for their lives
6, 7, and 8 a boil storms a fire and locusts
9 is darkness so dark it's hard for you to focus
and 10 is death of the firstborn
If I said it was questionable the religions would make it a point
to get at me and battle me maybe have this verse torn
How will this curse form?
Well creation is a bendarwinism{?}
been at it forever bout at it I got nothin but hurt for em
Cuz really nobody knows when you live then you die where your body goes
if it's Hell or it's Heaven
6 or the 7 well I'll keep the nina for our be foes in a gamble
that's what life is and it's hard to handle
when the bible says worship this by the scriptures written by man though
So when man destroys us the word might not stand so
till that day I'm just gon protect my fam with ammo

(Chorus)

(VERSE 2)
Ive been looking for something supernatural for a long time now
but I never got proof that a spiritural realm existed wanted to find how
everybody sure of a supreme being, are people just seeing things?
wondering if we get wings, seems sick to believe in an extreme king
I know it sounds far fetched, every night i put knees on the carpet
then I pray to who's up with the star set
cuz the earth in its self is a target
for destruction, for cumbustion
cuz there aint too many you can trust in
think of all the women losing their husbands
in Iraq a lot of killing and suffering
what i hope for, seems folklore
when the enemy kills and gloat more
cuz they killin us off in this hoax war
then I wake up yellin and my throats sore
cuz the fight's there, its a nightmare
if it come to me I'm in my snipe wear
if a bullet give my lung a slight tear
I wanna believe that the light's there
so all you christians don't get mad at me
i just hope that your mystical, magical miracle's workin catastrophies
and this ain't blasphemy, but artilery is my strategy
I hope for a higher power when i look at all these tragedies

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
oh what a miracle, angels and demons
but the only miracle is that people keep believin
right hand on the bible, left hand on my rifle
keep that for my rivals and evil desciples
expand your mission, man to women
when they attack do you plan to give in
or do you do like i do and say praise the lord and pass the ammunition
people like us
piece and knife up
cuz we got evil to sweep and wipe up
devils and demons and humans, irrelevent
if they lookin deceiving i bust
I hope that the higher power is watching over me
cuz we young people don't see faith like most the older see
if he or she is listenin
a mere sign can spark me
but if the laws in the bible are bogus
then prepare for anarchy
worst case scenario is there never ever was a higher power
so in the midst of chaos now
the only real savior is fire power

(Chorus)</pre>
