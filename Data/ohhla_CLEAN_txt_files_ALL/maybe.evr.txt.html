Maybe you could take a little piece of my pain
Maybe you could make it all feel the same
Maybe you could burn this night in my brain
Maybe you could find someone else to blame
For all this pain, maybe, maybe, maybe

Maybe you could tell me about your worst fear
Don't say it out loud, whisper in my ear
Ain't never felt nothing like this here
Maybe you could see things a little more clear
Dry away your tears

I love you are just three words that are overused when we're talking
Love and friendship, situations get confusing so often
Maybe I should give this woman my name, a piece of my pain
Maybe, maybe, maybe

Maybe we could talk about all my dreams
Watch them all come apart at the seams
Sometimes when it rains it really teams
Sometimes they cut diamonds with laser beams
Whatever that means

I love you are just three words that are overused when we're talking
Love and friendship, situations get confusing so often
Maybe I should give this woman my time, that would be fine
Maybe, maybe, maybe

I love you are just three words that are overused when we're talking
Love and friendship, situations get confusing so often
Maybe I should give this woman my name, a piece of my pain
Maybe, maybe, maybe</pre>
