[DCT in effect!]

Now you were born right into a world of sin
Short of god, the lord of all men
From the jump on the sixth day
A breath of life embarked a nu way
All they could want and so much more
Satan made a move to settle the score
Threw out a bait that still don't miss
A human want whatcha cannot have fix

[Chorus]
No more givin' in
No more givin' in to this thing we call sin
I'm sayin'
No more givin' in
No more givin' in to sin

The fall of man cold lit the spark
And offspring gotta deal with a heart
Full of sin, all guilty at birth
Fight it like a habit for all you're worth
Until you find thatcha cannot stand
Super-natch defeats a mere man
But there's a way to get ahead of the sin game
Beat it down in the power of god's name

[Chorus]

(vamp)

This givin' in's gotta come to an end
Through Christ, we can say no to sin
More of god, much less of me
Is the key thought to a victory
But it can't be done with an unsure vow
And you'll fail til ya choose to bow your head
But when ya finally do
You'll find the words of god to be true

[Chorus] 2X

Word up people, we ain't about sin no more
As a matter of fact,
We cold boycottin' sin right off the face of this earth
Yo k-max, you down with that?
[I'm steppin' to that!]
Yo t, you got my back on this boycott sin thang?
[ya know it, holmes!]
Word up sin, you are history!

[Chorus]</pre>
