Yo, this is a story of a male female threat to society
You know being misjudged and not respected for what we are
But I want to send this special shout out to my girl Tawana Brawley
Cause no matter what we say or what we do
They'll always believe his story (Oww)

[Chorus]
His story (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
His story (Oww)
They're gonna believe
His story
His story

Why does it have to be that we get labeled for what we do
It's hard enough for us to be ourselves without being used
Girls have an image too
But when they get mad at you
There is no telling what they'll say to hurt you

This is a story of a male female threat to society
Why you wanna go and tell a lie on me? (Yeah, yeah, oooh)

His story over mine his story will be his story
And my story is a waste of time (Aaaah-aah-aah)
They're gonna believe

[Chorus]

Sometimes I feel like there is no reason for me to explain
No matter how much we complain
You know it all stays the same
They try to call us freaks
Why does it have to be
We can't get justified until we speak up (Oooh)

This is a story of a male female threat to society
Why you wanna go and tell a lie on me? (Yeah, yeah, oooh)

His story over mine his story will be his story
And my story is a waste of time (Aaaah-aah-aah)
(You know it's just a waste of my time)
They're gonna believe
His story over mine
So what you gonna do
Don't let it take over you (Hey)
My story is a waste of time

It's hard enough to be ourselves without being used
So yo take it from me
Don't be a victim of society
You can't put yourself in a position to be neglected
And disrespected
You have to do what's not expected
Alright
Or all be his story

His story over mine
His story will be his story

(This is a story of) how could you do this to us
They're gonna believe
His story over mine
His story will be his story and
My story is a waste of time
They're gonna believe
His story over mine
His story will be his story
And my story is a waste of time
You're gonna believe

This is a story of a male female threat to society
Why you wanna go and tell a lie on me? (yeah, yeah)
This is a story (Peace, love and hair and grease from TLC) of a male
Female threat to society
Why you wanna go tell a lie on me? (Yeah, yeah, ho)</pre>
