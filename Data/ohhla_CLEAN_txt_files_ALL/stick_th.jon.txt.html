[Intro - Pharrell Williams]
Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up! turn me up!
Yo! turn me up, turn me up! up some more!
Up - up some more! Up - up some more!
Yeah, up up some more!

[Verse - Pharrell Williams]
I walk in the club so dashin, in the latest BBC fashion
The light from the strip club flashing
Keep the sparkle in my ear rings dancing
We're hundred G makers till they cremate us
Skateboard P in the lime green gators
White chinchilla, million dollar neck glitter
Yeah I got security, see that gorilla
When you got money, it's hard to hide it
Took my hand out my pocket and watched her eyes get
Big, took a million to supersize it
All the bitches saying 'Heyyy' like my name was Issac
Why you put me on blast like that?
Shit why you shaking wit an ass like that?
Besides I wasn't really trying to smash like that
I got a girl - bitch I ain't fast like that
This Miami, time's wasting, bet that bass line keep you shaking
Look, end of the night all my niggas is waiting
Uh uh, not me ma, told ya I'm taken

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams &amp; (Lil Jon)]
(Stick that thang out!) Some more
Uh! uh! some more, skeezer!
(Stick that thang out!) Some more
Yeah - uh! uh! some more
(Stick that thang out!) Some more
Uh! uh! some more, skeezer!
(Stick that thang out!) Some more
Hold it!! Yeah - uh! uh! some more

[Verse - Lil Jon &amp; The Eastside Boyz]
I said ain't nothing but tutti fruity
Get on the floor if ya got that booty
Shake what ya momma gave ya, shake what ya momma gave ya
I said ain't nothing but tutti fruity
Get on the floor if ya got that booty
Shake what ya momma gave ya, shake what ya momma gave ya
Dance, too much booty in your pants
Dance, too much booty in your pants
I said dance, too much booty in your pants
Dance, too much booty in your pants
Well shake that ass bitch and let me see what ya got
Well shake that ass bitch and let me see what ya got
Hey! hey! hey! I said shake it, don't break it
It took ya momma 9 months to make it
I say shake it, dont' break it
It took ya momma 9 months to make it
Well scrub the ground, scrub the ground, scrub the ground

[Pharrell] Hold it! (okay)

[Bridge - Pharrell Williams]
Hey! She really likes to party
She really likes to dance
She really likes to dance, dance, dance..

[Verse - D-Roc]
I like a fine ass bitch, a down ass bitch
A money getting bitch, I love that shit
Cause she danced in the club, and yes she gon call
If you got a little money she taking her clothes off
She dance like a muhfucking dance machine
Taking her ass to the beat for me
Nigga ain't spending more money than a lil bit
But I really love that shit, I love that shit!

[Verse - Kaine]
Yeah! thick bitch wit a drive to fuck
Get her off in the truck and she bound to suck
The ho love to bump, she don't like knee pads
She scrub em up, her legs that is
Fat puddy cat wit a head that's trill
The type of bitch have a nigga not paying bills
Fo reeeaaalll.. by our God damn selves
Fuck thirty niggas and she don't need help

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams &amp; (Lil Jon)]
