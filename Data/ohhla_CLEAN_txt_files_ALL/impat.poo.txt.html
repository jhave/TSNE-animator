[Ms. Cris]
I'm growin impatient, I'm growin impatient
I'm growin impatient, I'm growin impatient

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I'm up with the roosters, niggaz ain't used ta
pullin ya own weight, your life needs producers
Won't be Medusaed, turn off the radio
I tried to warn 'em, Black, but they ain't ready yo
Aim, steady flow, rank confetti mode
People know about struggle then they gettin dough
You either get low or become a victim
Yo' peoples ain't good. better get 'em, here I come

[Chorus: Rapper Big Pooh] (Ms. Cris)
My mind keep runnin, niggaz stay frontin
Time to start somethin (I'm growin impatient)
My mind stay spinnin, why I ain't winnin?
Even though a nigga grinnin (I'm growin impatient)
(I-I, I'm growin impatient)
(I-I, I'm growin impatient)
(I-I, I'm growin impatient)
(I-I, I'm growin impatient)

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Bottle of Jack in my hand, stumbled off stage
Said a few words that I crumpled on the page
Discarded my shirt, baby this is work
That real rap shit, I ain't talkin 'bout a jerk
It's back to the room, and back to the ebb
'Bout a week from now, I won't remember I was here
The white people stare, fuck 'em~! I don't care
Let the tats on my arms explain why I was here
A fort for the share, yeah run your budget
Niggaz bein cheap, Hammer +Can't Touch It+
Couple hours down then it's back to the sound
One phone call and I'm back to the ground, runnin!

[Chorus]

[Rapper Big Pooh]
This is dedication, things that I'm facin
will never get the best of me, simply outpace 'em
Glass in case 'em, spoils at the end
They smile in your face but we are not friends
Why should I pretend when you will never extend
your hand out the end when I started to win? 
Hah, the rain is now comin to the end
The sun always shines on the sun I ascend - the end

[Outro: Ms. Cris]
I-I, I'm growin impatient
I-I, I'm growin impatient
I-I, I'm growin impatient
I-I, I'm growin impatient</pre>
