[Tech N9ne]
What's sizzlin
Demons, angels, and civilians
Welcome to my purgatory party baby
They say it ain't nothing but farms where we from
They think we can't do no one harm where we from
Gorillas and killers and thugs from abyss
Tech N9ne making 'em breathe like what like this
Kansas City (fade) wake up yo like this

[Tech N9ne]
One, and then comes the two to the three and four
Two-thousand Techa N9na is hardcore with a K
See me step up on the track like a thug
Make it pound at West end then make a dub
To the homies in jail
When you making bail
Time to act an idiot
A lot not just a little bit
Watch when Kansas City hit
Tech N9ne's gonna spit it
You want this record cool go get it
Hot when the flames lit
Gloc where the bane sits
Shock when the pain quits
Pac would've banged this
Instantaneous when I aim at the miscellaneous
Ask me ask ask why why I'm the strangest
Because
Nobody ever wanted me rapping
But I knew within me I could make it happen
Flipping hella different to get it cracking
Never biting nothing I was never jacking
Millimeter spitting ripping up a show
Got the people trippin' everywhere we go
And now we getting you to know that misery is coming
We were summoned now the haters running when we gunning
Yo you don't know
That I'm 'bout to blow K C M O
Better bang this
People make their jokes and say we're off to see the wizard
Well me and Dorothy and Toto's on your ass when you visit

(Hook - [Tech N9ne])
It's alive aw hell
It's alive dod gwamn
It's alive odd male
It's alive I am
Been in the dark a minute but now I made it through it
This Kansas City Imma show you how we do it

We say walla
Milli dollar
Then break a lot a jaw (2x)
Watch this rock

[Tech N9ne]
Who would bust like my style it's ruffcut and it's
True hood stuff bright hot wild mystic plus mannish
Alien nation invasion
Black white and even asian
Is gazing at the raised in misery faze ravin'
For the crazed heaven
Six six triple eight forty-six ninety-nine three
We back
Sick with nickel plates whorey chicks mighty mine be
We pack
Just when you're knowing where I'm gonna be I vanish
Step into my brain got it so dark that you can't see Godd dammit
Your flows come in your flows go out
My flows eternally coming out your mouth
Your makers in some haters doubt
And yes it's pitiful
Not even my pinnacle
Better know when I bust
I can do it everyday with a mind full of lust
If you really must
Get with a N9ne millimeter gun then trust
You'll get left the in the dust
Everybody better move when I groove Imma hit 'em with a bus
Anybody with a bigger mouth up in here better hush

(Hook repeat)

Kansas City City City
That's where I really wanna be grime and gritty gritty gritty
Back up when I throw that V up in the air air air
That's five seven R D V
And you know nare nare nare
That'll represent like me
Yo we did it in Kansas City yo we did it
Like Biggie say
Much love my left mind said Tech N9ne is iggy J
You can find me off in Kansas City on Saturday at Maniax
Or at the Motel 6 laying up with two chicks the Lenny and Squiggy way
Or jack
Tripper I'm Tech the rap
Ripper on Cognac
Liquor I'm Tech the gat
Clicker I'm up on that
Thicker than water track a whipper snap
Who's trying to bring Tony Kannedy Del Shawn and Chipper back
Signing off rhyming off the wall constantly
Timing off never that clever raps the comp can't be
Creeping seeping through crevices hella beefing
Thinking they can stop the heart of Kansas City
but the heart of Kansas City is beating

(Hook repeat)

We say walla
Milli dollar
Then break a lot of jaw (4x)</pre>
