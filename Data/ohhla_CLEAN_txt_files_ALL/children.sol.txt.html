[Sole]
Thank God I never made it to Earth, what a happy place
how I long to be depressed, to be a grouch, get away

Yo, Yo Here I stand in the desert sands 
There I lay in a dust storm, brain storms 
Some day we may form a massive collective mind with no bandages 
I kneel down to fantasy of what is real 
Thus far the only signs of freshness 
I came across upon this quest was nothingness 
Posessed to find truth at all costs elementally 
I walk a thin line of good and evil coincidentally 
We all believe in god and nature and higher levels 
Yet we dwell with devil's machinery in lower levels of raped scenery 
It's seemingly endless 
Demeaning and mindless, we're friendless and meaningless 
Living in darkness walking with candles 
And while I'm on the subject of difference is lame 
I've noticed the more things change the more things stay the same 
To stay in focus 
It's hopeless to go against the grain while new to this 
Till I'm menopaused and then ejected from the uterus 

Chorus 
And I've seen so far into the night 
And lingered in the land of no night 

Day two I've left the earth and all is alien and foreign 
Females are wailing and I'm swimming in a cest pool 
It's pouring 
It ain't dark no more, no more worth the fight 
My old candles turn to sunglasses, I can't stand the light 
Yet I can't stand the rain these bodies I live with are numb 
And I can't stand the pain these children I play with are dumb 
A figure points a finger and whispers, "leave" 
This small porcelain tomb
It will be all I will have achieved 
And I refuse to be excrement 
dash to the left and to try to and break for my life 
A large hand grabs me now, there's no escape 
I'm thrown into a whirlpool, spinning until infinity 
Grasping for an oxygen breath, but I don't breath that yet 
Inhale the H20 and thank life I'm still living breath 
Giving death a hell of a run until the movement stops 
Bubble to the surface almost dead ass out 
Starving cold and alone until I pass out 

chorus 

Living ain't all that, I wanna go back to non-existence 
The womb was not meant to be a tomb, but once I've gone the distance 
Won't sleep to see revenge for my dead sibling, I miss her
I watched my brother be impaled as I held the hand of my sister 
Kissed her when she was void 
Missed the missile, I'm docile
Amongst dead soil and fossil till I'm deployed 
None of it ever happened 
As far as I'm concerned I'm barred 
Should've died months ago in the condom 
and this wouldn't have been so hard 
Should'nt of, but it's not that way 
I fought that way 
I lay until I no longer thought that way 
None of this was worth the fight, I should have been disposed 
At night time, laying only half of the trash can 
Not white trash in a trailer park 
Or a dismembered rash lashing utter last sole 
member of a coathanger tailored art 
With no formed identity blanketed by newspapers 
Remedy be levity, life be the penalty 
This body in a mask grow fast carry out the masquerade 
I lay in the cut to hear lies, pawns, peons, and tricks of this trade
In this eon let me be on and beyond the next decade 
There I stayed remain of flux to be another child saved
