"Take a deep breath relax, don't push it on out."(x2)
Somebody please explain to them what it be about
"Take a deep breath relax, don't push it on out."(x2)
Somebody please explain to them what it be about

They can't sleep yet, too many re-grets
Got em running round in circles for the re-spect
They need the gossip, but where's the logic?
Voices in the box guarantee a better product
So here I sit now, and watch em trip out
Trying to pick a finger to put upon what its about
But if there was a point, you would still avoid
You should've taught the boys and girls how to take apart their toys
I stay up-set,with all the pup-pets
submerged in the drama cuz they love it
That if they can hold the pain, and then they complain

Why would you chase away the sun if you don't want the rain?
I never asked for the world, just a portion
Tryin to make a good soldier out of daddy's little orphan
But management called down, demanded that we turned the sound down
And with that, I suggest we start the count-down
Simplistic spiral and work your way backwards
'Til the bastards collapse and choke on their last words
And I'll be back when its happy hour
So just pour me another and ignore me my brother

[Chorus]
Breathe in, breathe out, the sign says "keep out"
Breathe in, breathe out, somebody please explain to them what it be about
Breathe in, breathe out, the sign says "keep out"
Somebody fill up my gut before I freak out

Low profile, no more smiles, til all of y'all quit acting so damn wild
Slow down child, you're gonna lose balance, too
overanxious, the goods will get damaged
Girl, how many stories can you fit into a tanktop?
How many wishes get spent on what you ain't got?
The youth want truth, well thank god
Tryin to keep it movin, while you're sittin in the same spot
Been in this cage for a long time (long time)
Been coverin this page with the wrong rhymes (wrong rhymes)
Got a strong mind, I got a weak will
I've got bad nerves and I can't keep still
But I stay humble, so when the meek take the planet
I can get a little piece with my name on it
The only problem is by then I won't want it
I'm in the backyard praying and hoping for the comet
Are you lookin to remember or searchin for adventure?
I guess it all depends on the agenda
Do you carry a grudge? Do you carry a gun?
I guess it all depends on where you come from
Surroundings are gonna dictate the needs
I'm out, I wanna live around lakes and trees
And I'll be back when its happy hour
So just pour me another and ignore me my brother

[Chorus]

Breathe in...</pre>
