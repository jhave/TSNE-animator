Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Future]
We on that drank we on that drank
I got 20, 000 on me by mistake
How can I not ball until everything fade away
How can I not how can I not

[Chorus: Future]
How can I not make a movie
How can I not do this shit that these niggas don't love
How can I not get the Xans and the mollies the percs and the drank and the drank in the Syrup
How can I not take my style back from niggas
When niggas was taking my style way before
How can I not how can I not how can I not
How can I not how can I not how can I not
How can I not how can I not how can I not
How can I not get this gwala and flip all this gwala
Because a young nigga was starving
How can I not make this music for dealers and killers and niggas who out there be robbing

[Verse 1: Future]
Run in your spot smashing your ho fuck on your couch
Quit Running your mouth flipping my pen beginning to end
Telling the plot look at my watch fuck all your thoughts
I appreciate you niggas I appreciate you bitches for keeping me relevant talk all you want drank all I want
How can I not make you niggas regret how can I not go and get me a check how can you not get hooked on percocet
How can you not be the one who was star how can you not be the one who was king
How can you not come around all these niggas and I stare at these niggas be rocking this bling
Cum bitch then cum again how can I not want to fuck her friend
Proper game make em all wonder how it feel being with a pimp
Everyday something different money cars clothes different
Me and money got a chemistry me and you a big difference

[Chorus: Future]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Gotta get this gwap set down that block scrape them pots
Gotta call this plug count this check how can I not
Gotta work them spots work them Glocks watch that clock
Gotta move these bricks I'm on probation bitch I'm hot
How can I not get all this money give all my niggas in the hood a block
Buy a drop and another watch then flex some more nigga how can I not
Them freeband niggas got all that money but bmg how we stamp them blocks
We remix bricks in Mexico you know we take a half off top
Jugg with my money nigga how can I not fuck you mean I got 20 spots
Niggas swagger jacking off of Future trying to steal his spot
Cause we make that million dollar music and we off the block
Drought season hit up hector phone nigga how can I not

[Chorus: Future]

[Outro: Future]
We on that drank we on that drank
I got 20, 000 on me by mistake
How can I not ball until everything fade away
How can I not how can I not

Before you got in the race nigga
I already lapped the niggas you with and
The niggas who coming behind me You Heard Me
Subliminal ass bitches</pre>
