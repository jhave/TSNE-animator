[Intro]
It's late in the headquarters, 2014
Everyday is a struggle
We dread the day and pray we make it through the night
Anything turn up we with it
So I buzz cut my hair
Put on my please-come-trip-with-me suit
Lace my boots tight and what
Ahhwoo ahhwoo ahhwoo
Turn up, turn up

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Hard times living in this bad land of mine
Everybody on vanilla skys by design
A lot of my brothers are buried, a lot of 'em in there prime
So take my chopper and stick it where the sun don't shine
Ahhh - please don't make me make you say that
Tripping cause momma ain't really happy where she stay at
I can't afford to move her away until I pay that
IRS a new Maybach, I'm tripping don't come my way, Jack
Son needs a way through college
Daughter too, harder, you gotta pay for true knowledge
Surised when a guy get layed off
Everything ain't payed off enterprise
Beam up, I'm finna die, and a lie, clamanime minimize
I'mm kinda tripping in my go clothes
Step up malicious and 10, I'm throwing boat loads
To my soul goes
The average person they hurting cause for certain everybody's dolo

[Chorus x2: Big Scoob]
I'm with the bullshit tonight
If they tripping I ain't tryna do right, uh, uh
I'm with the bullshit tonight
Let it loose on every devil in sight, turn up

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Yeah, tell 'em I'm tripping, I'm at war with these devils
Dumped that bitch in the gutter, make 'em get on my level
I give a fuck about nothing the way I'm strapped with this metal
I was tripping in the back of a truck that I done packed with these shovels
I don't want no problems, just want you to leave me the fuck alone
Before I end up inside of a cell and have a neighborhood inside of your home
My money be funny just laughin at niggas
And the hoes they got keep asking them niggas
How I'm crashing them niggas while I'm passing them niggas
Well, take your seat and fasten them niggas
Before I dispose the trash of them niggas, go to smashing them niggas
I'm on that bullshit, ain't nobody finna pull shit
D got my wrists rolls-es balling, I'm on some bullshit
Pay attention
They don't get any realer, hey there killer, about that drama
Terroristic, risk getting [?] Osama
If I don't get you The Boss [?] with that llama
Bitch this is what we do, believe it, downing niggas' mama's

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
Cocaine on my mind, my table, I'm out of line
Doing lines open wide, nigga suicide
Blood in my vein, hella drugs in my vein
Rap with the strap, keep the thugs entertained
All my foes I leave critical, they pitiful
I'm a 5 star general, East side cannibal
West side salute it, all these kids my students
Class still in session, the shooters I just recruited
Turn up - look I came to bust a motherfuckin head
Got some wild knucklehead killers bucking lead
I came from the bottom, now I'm on the roof
I'm big-headed so the coupe never had a roof
Thug life, got that 2Pac up in my boombox
Gassing on these pussies, no brakes, they pray I do stop
We all with the bullshit and I'm the boss
When I holla shake down we gonna set it off

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Big Scoob]
So with it, if you want it then you gonna get it
So terrific with this bullshit, the best that did it
The best to give it, get me livid then I'm diving in it
These pussies talk it, they don't walk it, they ain't never did it
Aim and bust then I bust then I bust and bust
Blood gush in the rush from the school crushed
Scarce thoughts being bought from these wars fought
Real talk, I'm a validated warhawk
History, this ain't shit to me, let's get it, V
Click the heat, no defeat, I need victory
It's meant to be what these villain niggas bent to be
Tendecies, stick this story, fuck the enemy
Snapping and losing it fast - Ruger, extended the mag
Fuck it, they wearing no mask - jump out and dumping the brass
Crushing, concussion these fast - a movie where Scoobie get mad
Jesus ain't helping your ass - leaving inside of a bag
I'm with the bullshit </pre>
