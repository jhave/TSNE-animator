Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Put on a gas
I am fast
Living...
I have no contra...
Now I am taking bad... with politicians
Helicopter feds I am... to get to know...
I don't want to brag but you ain't tried to hear about
The money drugs and women that I wanna add
Smoked so much that I am going brain death
Whores are made of me cause my phone...
I tell her wow slow down baby... lady
You drive by I... it's a couple of paper plans
Broadcasting my name over internet
Airways bitches... on twitter put my music on my space
If you smoked the role and played this I'm gonna hustle... </pre>
