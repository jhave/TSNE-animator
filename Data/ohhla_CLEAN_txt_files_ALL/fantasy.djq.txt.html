Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Who taught you how to do this shit?
Yeah, you bad than a motherfucker

Tell me, why are you so curious
And why you keep on starin'
At the motherfuckin' zipper on these jeans
That I'm wearin' cause baby what's in there
Is beyond your wildest dreams
And although it seems that I'm on the nigga hoe team
Girl, listen, listen, Mary don't you weep
I don't come cheap and I'm not just no nigga off the street
I'm a certified specialized pro
Who's got a lot of soul when you're swingin'
Off the end of my pole
But the matter at hand is the size
And how it makes ya act
When you get it up and in between your thighs
You could squirm and squeal and try to make a deal
That'll keep me on your jock
For whenever you get that feelin' for the real
And when it gets swollen
You think you'll be controllin' me
Because I put the pole in your hole, see
But however it's done, it's 68 and I owe you 1
I'm doin' it for the thrill of it
So tell me can you feel it?

Chorus:

Itz your fantasy baby, tell me if you feel it
You know you wanna feel it
Itz your fantasy, sing it if you feel it

Okay, let's find a place, somethin' out of dodge
Like the Quality Inn or the Travelodge
Since I'm goin' out of my way
Baby you pay for the spot
See it's only right since you gettin' the cock
Now tell me who's gonna get the rubbers?
First things first, yes I like a bitch
Who carries Lifestyles in her purse
So since you know the play
Close the curtains all the way
And get ready for a toss and some rib sauce
With a little weed I could do a good deed
And as long as you ain't bleedin'
I can give you what you need
But I got a little ritual before we make love
You gotta dish-a-dish-a-scrub
Wash-a-wash-a-wash-a-rinse in the bathtub
Hennessy and apple juice to sip on
Get a little buzzed and we can get our dig on
So don't trip cause when you
Takin' off your clothes to reveal it
I'ma make you feel it

Chorus:

Sing it if ya feel it, itz your fantasy baby
Touch me if ya feel it, I need to know if you feel it
Can you feel it baby?

Now put it where you want it, get in where you fit in
Cause when it comes to hittin' it, splittin' it
I ain't bullshittin'
See, you look so good you make me wanna go bare back on ya
But I ain't hittin' unless I use the whole pack on ya
Bitch didn't ya know I have more stamina than a horse?
So don't trip just let the Hen take it's course
Yeah right now your frontin', 
Shy, actin' like you nervous, naw, turnaround, lay down
And let me pound on your cervix
Yeah, it's the Log Ride, like at Magic Mountain
Take it out your mouth and shoot it like a fountain
Pull and watch it explode
Let me change my tire and I'm right back on the road
Now is this more than you expected?
You let me drive that coochie and I wrecked it
So even though I'll never get another chance to kill it
It's cool just as long as I made you feel it

Chorus:

Itz your fantasy, tell me if you feel it
You know you love it, sing it if you feel it
You make me feel it, I know you feel it
You know you feel it, tell me if you feel it
Sing it if you feel it
Yeah, you feel it, I love to make you feel it
Oohh, you feel it
