Uh-huh nigga uh-huh
Picture me never sellin' out cause I made it already
Imagine a lil' ghetto nigga ownin' everything
Picture me in the middle of the project and I'm worth all this money
To my foes  It's funny huh?
Okay, love this

[Hook]
I bet y'all love the way I flips 'em out
Funny guy huh?
Now watch how these clips come out
I done took it where y'all can't go now how bout that
We done turned straight up ? niggaz into stumblin' kats
And they mad at me cause they I say I spit it too rugid
And we throw it at 'em like a chick who don't get it enough
What is it x-ray vision the way I see through these kats
That's why I roll with thugs who ain't scared to squeeze a strap

[Verse 1]
I keep my hand on my glock now
Fuck still roll with the top down
I'm hot so they gon' jock now
Keep my pistols cocked now
Still don't give a fuck
Still hold the block down
Still close the shop down
Picture me ballin' and everybody'll flock around
Picture me makin' 2 mill bail when I get locked down nigga
Clip to the uzi's
I'm like No Limit shit
With DMX with Ruff Ryders with Lauryn Hill to the Fugees
Picture a ghetto nigga like me poppin' up in movies
Or a topless supermodel poppin' up in jacuzzi's
Be like I'm worth a couple mill but I still ain't shit
Be like I'm worth a couple mill but uh I'm still in the bricks

Hook 2x's

[Verse 2]
It's okay, niggas wanna play games
On the low niggas hoes, they wanna say names
Snitch right when they get in front of the Feds
Pull me over 2-seater Benz with my dog Sunny Red
Look we got some bad chick in front of the bed
You can have her dog I gotta get my money instead
You know I'm the type of nigga
Look ball till I fall
Ain't satisfied till the marble go wall to wall
Got money still be in T-shirts and khaki's y'all
And I'm right here if y'all got somethin' to ask me dog
Always move forward
Never go backwards dog
Baz, Turk, Jimmy, Nut
That's who's gon' back me y'all
I don't stay in one place
I move from state to state
And I don't believe in drive-by's
I believe in face to face
Ya heard me

Hook 2x's</pre>
