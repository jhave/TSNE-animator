[Lord Infamous]
Yeah it's John niggaz, a.k.a. Orville Reddenbacher
Yeah I'm poppin God damn it like popcorn all God damn day
Whether it's ballers or maulers or choppers
Whether it's tags or scalawags God damnit
Formerly known as Pancho Villa
The writer of the constitution for the prostitution
Yeah I just jumped out my 'llac
To jump on this motherfuckin track
To talk about you fuck niggaz and you broke-ass bitches
Yeah I ain't been broke since eighty-fo' mo'fucker!</pre>
