[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Pass it to A-pass it to A-pass it to A-pass, pass..
Pass it to Arab, I'ma pass it to Arab
Pass it-pass it to Arab, I-I-I-I'ma pass it to Arab
Pass it-pass it to Arab, I'ma pass it to Arab
Pass it-pass it to Arab, I-I-I-I'ma pass it to Arab
Pass it-pass it to Arab, I'ma pass it to Arab
Pass it-pass it to Arab, I-I-I-I'ma pass it to Arab
Pass it-pass it to Arab, I'ma pass it to Arab
Pass it-pass it to Arab, I-I-I-I'ma pass it to Arab

[Verse One: Arab]
Pass it to Arab, watch my feet and my hands
Peep these cap on my head, peep these zoos on my pants
Stunna shades on my face, rubber bands on my neck
Do yo' dance in the club, and you know that it's a bet
Do it, I did it when you see it you already know
Hit the merry-go and twist my body as I take it slow
I'ma crank it up fo' Soulja pass it on to me
What'chu flinchin fo', cause you jumpin off on D

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Arab]
Yeah I'm in this thang, check my chain
Club got crunk when they heard that your boy came
Man what you sayin, I crank that Robocop
And make my shoulders drop, this snap go by my socks
Get low (get low) do it folk (do it folk)
Superman (Superman) jig 'em folk (jig 'em folk)
A-rab, Stacks on Deck, read and write up on my teeth
Cross my feet, snap on beat, I'll make that dance look lo-ve-ly

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Arab]
I crank my bapes (I crank my bapes) I crank my dance (I crank my dance)
If you gon' hate (if you gon' hate) I crank these hands (I crank these hands)
Don't stop (don't stop) do it, do it (do it, do it)
Pool palace (pool palace) and shoot it, shoot it (shoot it)
Ohhhh~! Do yo' dance, rolls up in it, pop yo' pants
I did it, don't jock my dance, while me crank that kick the can
Throw it up, in the air, and we fin' ta catch it folk
Seventeen years old and took over the whole show

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Uhh.. uhh, uhh
Uhh.. AH-uhh, uhh AH
Now walk with it now, now walk with it now (walk with it now)
Now walk with it now (walk with it now) now walk with it now (walk with it now)

[Chorus] - to fade</pre>
