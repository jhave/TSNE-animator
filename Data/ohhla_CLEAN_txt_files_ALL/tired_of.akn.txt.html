I'm sittin on my porch watchin the law
As they ride past in they patrol cars
So tell me why I feel like the enemy
They're supposed to be here protectin me
I might have went too far
Helpin to contribute to makin they job hard
Servin fiends like these people ain't no enemy
I can't believe I'm out here killin my community
If you knew how far I came (far I came)
From where I am and where I used to be (where I used to be)
Don't want it, you can tell by the look at me
This gangsta life ain't no longer in me
 
[Chorus: Akon]
And I'm tired of the runnin, tired of the runnin
Tired of the runnin, runnin from the law
Baby you gotta believe me
Said I'm tired of the runnin, tired of the runnin
Tired of the runnin, runnin from the law
Baby ya gotta believe me
 
[Akon]
I know there's things I could've changed girl
I know there's things I could've done a lot better
Instead I'm in the streets tryin to make that cheddar
Thinkin in my mind that you gon' be there forever
I know I could've let it all go (let it all go)
But I was thinkin it would make life better
Instead I'm sittin in this cell writin this letter
Thought I wouldn't get caught cause I was way too clever
I learned there's no one to catch ya when ya fallin
And they'll be no one to hear you when you're callin
Do you know what it's like to wake up in the mornin
While you're starvin you're hearin bugs crawlin
Reminiscin on them days you was walkin
With pretty women on your arm while you're flossin
Thankful that I didn't end up in a coffin
Somethin you see too often
 
[Chorus]
 
[Akon]
Said I'm tired...
Said I'm tired...
I said I'm tired...
So tired, yeah
 
[Chorus]
