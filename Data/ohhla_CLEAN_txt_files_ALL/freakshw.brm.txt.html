Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
All a nigga want is some fuckin' lip service
All a nigga want is some fuckin' lip service
Suck a nigga dick, hoe
Suck a nigga dick, hoe
I got a stack for the freak show
I got a stack for the freak show
Suck a nigga dick, hoe
Suck a nigga dick, hoe
I got a stack for the freak show
I got a stack for the freak show

[Verse 1: Reek Da Villain]
Okay, I'm ridin' through your city blowin' Diddy's of that icky
Got that... (haha) King Tut collection, it be with me
See my chain all gold, and my thing all chrome
On the highway to that money, boy, your lanes all closed
I be ridin' in that Ghost, plates say "Casper"
Blow a loud pack now my swag on NASA
Higher than the stars, spaces shuttle for a car
Lead pop, red hot, come from Mars with these bars
Pink Friday, I'm Nicki Minaj with these broads
I ain't babysittin' bitches but like Charles I'm in charge
Grave dig 'em out, 6 feet deep throat
With her tongue out like she's Jordan flyin' from the free throw
Bitch!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Sorry sloppy-second-nigga, coochie kinda gooshied up
That's what happens after niggaz done torn all the pussy up
Pussy in my face, want me taste your little cookie, what?
Gotta put in work, hope you ready for this bully fuck
I respect it shorty, all that surgery, your Nip &amp; Tuck
Wrap both of your lips around that dick, go head and sip this up
Go to shorty thinkin' she a trick and then she click and cluck
Yeah, you know the goal, diggin' a hole until my dick is stuck
Okay, I'm wildin' on my style, give me the goodies, shorty
If you ain't ready to do me then bounce with your rookie ass
On second thought I'm 'bout to go fuck with your friend until the party end
'Cause I noticed it got some kind of booty rash

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: J-Doe]
I ain't perfect but these bitches think otherwise
A side piece ain't even lookin' at no other guys
Came to the suite with two bags and she left with four
Two in her hands, and two under her eyes
We was up all night and I was goin' in
Beat it up so long she wished she'd brought a friend
So she could take a break
I don't even take these bitches on a dinner date
Might send a tweet, follow on Instagram
Next day she in my ride and she goin' HAM
Damn, it's crazy
Get 'em and get rid of 'em so fast it's amazing

[Chorus]</pre>
