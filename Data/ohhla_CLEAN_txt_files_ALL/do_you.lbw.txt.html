[Bow Wow]
uh-huh, uh-huh, UH..
106 &amp; Park ain't been the same since I had it
So I'm back at it - freeze
Still a +juvenile+ at +400 Degrees+
Lil' girls still fallin' out, I'm still ballin'
Crawlin' out the hottest speeds on these ATL streets
From the Garden, to the box office, I shuts down both
And no matter where I go I'm still, O-H-I-Ohhhhhhh
E'rybody know this is MY turf!
Who had it crunk first, and had girls of all ages off one verse?
(YOU!) Ain't nobody else can name
Another seventeen year-old manye that do it this HARD
"Oh LORD", that's what them old niggaz say about me
Young niggaz play, can't go a day without me
If bling was a drug, I'd DIE from an overdose
Fresh Prince to Sugarloaf, Homey I'm the most you've seen
I got the same affects on both coasts
And e'rything hot on fo' wheels, homey I'm ghost

[Hook 1]
Do you - stop tryna be me, stop tryna be he
Stop tryna do what you see
Do you - 'Cause right here is my love homey
Go back to where you came from and get yo own homey
Do you - It's so-so sloppy and the fans know a copy
When they see one, I would neva wanna be one
Do you - As long as it sound right
E'rybody in town like it
Don't worry 'bout nobody else, else
Do you

Not just the rap game, the whole industry the same
E'rybody wanna look and sound like the next manye
But I'm definite there ain't another me
And I'm So-So-Definite, back wit J.D
Back to give these little imitators sumthin' to talk on
Breathe, Stretch, let it go, homey get yo walk on!
Black Beat, Teen People, can't forget Right On!
A lotta things changed since the young don's been gone
What chug on roll with? The future is me!
Only youngins that's movin' units is.ugh.ME
Young Ali, float like a butterfly
Get up out them stores quick, why wouldn't you wanna buy?
The carbon copy, not the copy
Imitators mimic, but them guys is sloppy, heh, heh
As for me, I'm the leader of the new school
I can just ad-just, so the rest of y'all just

[Hook 1]
Do you - stop tryna be me, stop tryna be he
Stop tryna do what you see
Do you - 'Cause right here is my love homey
Go back to where you came from and get yo own homey
Do you - It's so-so sloppy and the fans know a copy
When they see one, I would neva wanna be one
Do you - As long as it sound right
E'rybody in town like it
Don't worry 'bout nobody else, else
Do you

[Jermaine Durpi - talking]
See?!
It's rare to find people like us..
Everybody out there doin what I'm doin!
Or tryna do what I'm doin, you can't man!
At one point in ya life, man, you gotta get in yo own lane and stop swervin' in mine!
See what I do, I do my way!
What about you, huh?! HUH?! CAN YOU SAY THAT?!

[Hook 2]
Do you - stop tryna be me, stop tryna be he
Stop tryna do what you see
Do you - 'Cause right here is my love homey
Go back to where you came from and get yo own homey
Do you- [Choir singing]
Do you
Do you
