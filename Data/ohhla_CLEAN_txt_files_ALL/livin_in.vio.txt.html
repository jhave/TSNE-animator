[Chorus: Butch Cassidy] 
We been mashin on the scene, off of green 
All you other niggaz talkin the shit 
But you really ain't doin a thing 
Always stayin on my toes, all them hoes 
We keep it pimpin, ain't no time to be steppin 
So get my money girl, you know how it goes 

[R.C.] 
Uhh, yeah, yeah 
Aiyyo I'm about to wreck your body, they said 'Turn the party out' 
Me and G about to burn them Harleys out 
Anything goes to get that cream, playa 
Bottles up just to get that lean 
Niggaz try to get in my team and my cream 
I'm the doctor, I give shots like vaccines 
They said I couldn't do it, but I show 'em somethin different 
I'm odd, never catch me without my gangsta equipment 
Two rap shits and mafia tactics 
I cook coke, make you snap back like elastic shit 
and keep a lean esteem, the kickstand 
All-star five, no need for a sixth man 
I got chips, man the change for the quicksand 
War in the mix and the home of Tha Liks man 
I don't discriminate, my niggaz get rid of weight 
Even hoes get it - competition disintegrate 

[Chorus] 

[Gravy] 
Yeah, uhh 
Criminal minded, you've been blinded 
Lookin for a style like mine, you can't find it 
You know a nigga gotta get that cheese 
on the West side with Chuck Taylor's and khakis 
East side Airforce One's and white tees 
We right, you never seen no boys like these 
We murdered it anyway, cut balls off 
Y'all don't wanna get with them shots from the sawed-off 
Y'all get one hit then y'all fall off 
We so sick we spit bars 'til we cough 
We don't tell stories, we live 'em 
We don't, take strokes fucka, we give 'em 
With a crossover single like I'm bilingual 
Who you think you gon' see, at the awards? 
Cause I bring more drama than all three of them broads 
You sicker than me?  You sound sick! 

[Chorus] 

[Q. Pacino] 
Open up the do', and let them boys in 
They from the streets, they here to bring the noise in 
But don't let 'em know, they hustle in that poison 
That's how it goes, when we're livin in the city 

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
