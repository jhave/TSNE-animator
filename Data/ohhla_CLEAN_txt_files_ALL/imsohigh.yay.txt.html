[ad libs for first 10 seconds]

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
Man I, get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go?
Take two pulls, and then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that

[Tony Yayo]
It's the up North title taker, rollin lah
in that Riker's Island bible paper, high as a skyscraper
I'm fresh out of jail smokin pounds of haze
Duckin my P.O., cause I'm high for days
Hydro, weed-o got my mind in the zone
Don't fuck up my high bitch, leave me alone
Let it spread to the head, two pulls and pass
Stop steamin on the weed girl, make it last
I'm so high, Banks so high
Buck so high, Dre so high
We be gettin high smokin chocolate tye
That's why I got the cotton mouth and my throat is dry
Yo I'm out in L.A. at the cheeba spot
While you lightin up dirt where the seeds'll pop
And I'm chasin it down, with Henny and Hypno'
Two pulls and pass, you know how fast the weed go

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Tony Yayo]
I'm hittin G-13 in that 645
Eyes real low it's gettin hard to drive
And I pray to God po's don't pull me over
Cause the Coupe real smoky off that green Arizona
Smoke on Monday, parole on Tuesday
Golden seal pills, don't use that usually
But I be gettin high nigga doin my thing
So my eyes Chinese cause I'm high like Yao Ming
Roll up all night, head get right
The hash plant mixed with that Northern Light, right
White rhino, white weirdo
Light people roll up that indo
Jamaican people roll that Bob Marley
Wind up your body, stink up the party
And we be puffin hard 'til the weed is done
Cause we got love for that Cheech &amp; Chong

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Outro - in a P-Funk style]
Come smoke with me, come ride with me
Come toke with me, let your mind be free
This here ain't for no folks on asthma
My vision's like plasma
Come smoke with me, get high with me
Take a toke with me, let your mind be free
This here ain't for no folks on asthma
My vision's like plasma, whoahh-ohhh
So hiiiiiigh
So hiiigh, sooooo hiiiiigh
So hiiigh, sooo hiiigh
Soo hiiigh, hiiiigh {*fades out*}</pre>
