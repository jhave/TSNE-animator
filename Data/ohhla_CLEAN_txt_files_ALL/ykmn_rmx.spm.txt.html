[South Park Mexican]
(Verse 1)
I'm SPM
You know my name
I'm the one that came up, but never changed
I make my moves
Life is what you choose
I'm the one to smoke in different high schools
Stay off the streets
Homeboy, you'll never win
You're goin' two places
The graveyard or the pen
Contradiction on my chest
Lots of lipstick on my clothes
Can we ever be stopped
Only God knows
South Park
Sunnyside
I roll with the realest
Represent my area from Hillwood to the village
At the grocery store, they used to look over my shoulder
And saw a basket
Full of Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda
Conversation rules the nation
But in my hood
Talk is cheaper than a
Old wet
Piece of plywood
You boys is more phonier than cubic zirconia
Make you suckers
Pay the very day I get a hold of ya
My name is

(Verse 2)
Pass the greenery
Tweedle-lee, tweedle-la
Layin' in my spa
Takin' off my heina's bra
Me and the law
Had problems in the past
They smelled my grass, but could never find my stash
Who can it be
It's that boy, Los
I broke up with my chick
Cause my cash went up her nose
I tell ya what it was, and I tell ya what it is
There's ten year old men
And fifty year old kids
My flow is legendary, on the third of February
I wrote
This song at the old cemetary
I did my time
No sunshine
They must be gettin' bonuses for lockin' up my kind
My name is

Repeat Hook Twice

[South Park Mexican talking over Hook]
You see and didn't believe me, now look
The world is listenin'
The movement is here, the day is here
We ain't stoppin', homie
We just gettin' started
I see you jealous, hateful people wishin' the worst for us
You'll pay like the last ones did
You're pain is my freedom
We'll never be the same
You'll never catch up
I fight hate with love (Love...)

(Verse 3)
When I was young, I used to be a shoe shiner
And work
For a dime as a newspaper part-timer
Every now and then, my real dad would come around
Born and raised in Houston A.K.A. Hustle Town
My drop is on jock
And my game is on lock
My attic full of
Automatic weapons of assualt
The streets live in us
I think I broke a Guinness, last year
I took the record robbin' forty [{*dope*}] dealers
Dancin' with the wolves, man, my hood is jet black
But they had love for the only [{*wet*}]back
I got a sauna in my eighty foot bus
We don't chase paper
Paper chase us
You know my name

Repeat Hook Twice
