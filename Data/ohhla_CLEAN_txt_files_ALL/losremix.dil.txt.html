[Talib Kweli]
Brooklyn stand up, L.A. stand up
Matter fact, the whole planet rock with us now!

[Hook]
{*"Dazzlin - Dilated displayin' a new sound"*}
[All] We all live on stage!
{*"Run up in your venue like what what what!"*}
[Iris] Check it out y'all! [Evid] Check it out
[Iris] You're now rockin' with the world's best
{*"Dazzlin - Dilated displayin' a new sound"*}
[All] We all live on stage!
[Iris] And we do it for you
[Evid] We do it for you
[Talib] We do it for you
{*"Live on stage!"*}

[Iriscience]
Aiyyo, basic mathematics - add shit, subtract shit
Multiply, divide, break down shit to fractions
Equality - Not greater than or less than
Los Angeles, Brooklyn, connect to Manhattan
Expansion Team - Movin' through lights, cameras and action
Thoughts to ideas, designs to manufacturin'
??? to we blaze and make it happen
On stage I quote the bible then blast like Sam Jackson
{*"I jump on stage and change forms*}
Rock it, don't bug out, kid, my team scores
A lot of emcees out there with phony lives
They master the studio but never master the ceremon'
Check it live

[Hook]
{*"Dazzlin - Dilated displayin' a new sound"*}

[Iris] And we do it for you
[Evid] We do it for you
[Talib] We do it for you
{*"Live on stage!"*}

[Evidence]
You know we - break barriers, redefine the coast
Classic hits like Ice Cube's "AmeriKKKa's Most"
Dilated - extra extra, read the front page
Catch us live on stage - like Roxanne Shante
Straight out the cage - learn ya lesson
Yo, studio sessions are not shows
Learn ya lesson - in shows and studios
This here breath controls all I got to lose
But the architects respect it - live in House of Blues
Flow for my peeps - thats true
You know we take it live on stage
And new levels for you
Thirty bucks a ticket?
No, that's breads and breaks
So I'ma stay sharp and seperate the real from fakes
You know..

[Talib Kweli]
I got the crowd in the palm of my hands
It go like the dominant strands
Squeeze as hard as I can
Stormin' like that beach in Normandy
So just droppin' the sand
The way I'm rockin' the fans
Like when you take a homeless man and you promise him land
Understand I rock for Dilated
The longer you wait, longer you get violated
If words was notes, I say it the way Miles play it
I know my styles hated - you can't get nowhere near it
Instead of investin' in hate, you should invest in merit
Look at yourself, you monstrosity of hypocrisy
Tryin' to be the king of media, you the king of mediocrity
Chop your flow, disposable, like heroes of the prophecy
I got the evidence that me and Rock know how to flow properly
C'mon man!
