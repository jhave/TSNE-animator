[Intro - Classified - talking] (Mic Boyd) (*TV playing in the background*)
What time is it?
Man, what time'd you guys get back here?
(Ah, I don't know, six, seven, fuck)
What time is it now?
(Nine, ten, dahhh)
Here pass that over man
(*coughing*)
Yo, I ain't seen you guys since we got off stage last night
(I know)
(*yawning*)

[Verse 1 - Classified] (Mic Boyd)
Hey yo woke up, rolled out of bed, then I rolled up
Thought about the night before, how the whole show was
(Oh, you know what?) No, what? (Afterwards was so nuts), oh, what?
I thought you went to Subway, got a cold cut
(Nah, went to Tim's for a donut and a mocha)
Yeah, (then hit the after party with some hoes, who said they know us)
Oh those two chicks from the sticks, who were coked up?
(Yeah, bitch flipped, her and her boyfriend just broke up
Said she would do anything), oh, one of them girls
(No respect for themselves, yeah you know, one of them girls
Wanna get fixed up), uh huh, (stomach all nip/tuck)
Yeah, (tryin to get love but all I wanted was my dick sucked)
Man I stayed at the club way after the show finished
Had to listen to this fan tryin to battle me for twenty minutes
Said he respected me but kept disrespectin
Stupid MCs, will you ever learn your lesson?

[Chorus - Mic Boyd]
Now when you stuck in a van with seven of your man and you only got a gram
(Live it up! Live it up!)
And when you go to other places, get paid to get wasted (woo!), you know you're gonna take it
(Live it up! Live it up!)
And when you ran out of liquor, the bartender stiffed ya, what ya gonna do?
(Live it up! Live it up!)
And when you at the after party, never met nobody, what ya gonna do?
(Live it up! Live it up!)

[Verse 2 - Classified] (Mic Boyd)
So after the battle ended (yeah), with my number one fan
I packed up my CD's and merchandise into the van
Got paid, cash in hand, damn, short again?
(Man, that again? Fuck promoters and their scams
I had a great time at the party though), yeah? (Free liquor and weed
Like trick or treat, gather round, give it to me)
Oh shit, that must be nice, how you get the perks and all
Get the payoffs but never had to do no work at all
(Yeah, I can't complain), oh really? (I hate dealin with the crap in life
Even faked I was Classified for like half the night)
Huh? What? (Yeah, they thought I was you, it was quite funny
You should stop makin cartoon videos to save money)
Well damn, can you blame me? Promoters don't pay me (ha)
Said fuck it, hit the hotel, almost doin eighty
Cops pull me over (*police siren*) (oh shit), yeah man, I was gettin high
But they were from the Maritimes and the heard the song, so they let it slide

[Chorus - Mic Boyd]
Now when you stuck in a van with seven of your man and you only got a gram
(Live it up! Live it up!)
And when you go to other places, get paid to get wasted (woo!), you 
know you're gonna take it
(Live it up! Live it up!)

[Break - Mic Boyd] (Classified) - 2X
Night after night, we live this life
(Oh, one of them nights?) Yeah, one of them nights
(You know, one of them nights), another one of them nights

[Verse 3 - Classified] (Mic Boyd)
So bro last night was a little too much
Yeah, (it's 11 a.m. and I just threw up
Plus I'm runnin on three hours sleep and driftin out)
Man we gotta do this for another week, stick it out
Go get somethin to eat, we gotta leave, do it quickly
And put it on the promoter's credit card, who tried to stiff me
Got a long drive, so put it on his plastic
(Yeah, I'll grab some pillows and the TV while I'm at it)
So where we goin today? (Same shit, different town)
Another day, another show, on the road, different crowd
(Sound check is at six), the doors open at ten
Then we'll start this whole night all over again

[Chorus]</pre>
