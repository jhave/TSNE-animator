[RBX]
Tears fall from my face, they hit the ground and go boom
Nigga watch another youngsta lowered into the tomb
The good die young, you say it's all thy must
But he diiiied - caught up in a cocaine bust
The door busted open he tried to run
Failed to realize that the cop had a gun
Off the trigger goes, he dropped from his pose
Hit the ground and his blood FLOWED, mom's are cryin

"Woman lose her head and cry" -&gt; B. Marley
Mom's are cryin
"Cause her son, has been shot down in the streets and died" -&gt; B.M.
Mom's are cryin

A dude named Eligh, caught up in the driveby
Tears of a mother, watchin her son die
Set-trippin somebody slippin, bullets zippin and
Eligh gone for good, now his momma's livin
No need for cryin, not dyin, Eligh is dead
Point blank he took a nine cap to the head
Eligh, the wannabe gangsta from the hood
He wasn't that bad and he wasn't that good
All he understood is get crazy blitzed
So he bought some of that (uh) to get some of this (yeah)
This got him that but that went to them
and them, bein they who made his head lay
He didn't obey, he said he made this cash
CRACK from the gun, Eligh lays in ash
Smash, it hits the front page quick
Now business is conducted by this fool named Mick
Mick, fell for a trick
Soon to be dyin, and his mom, gon' be cryin

"Cause her son, has been shot down in the streets and died" -&gt; B.M.
Mom's are cryin
"Woman lose her head and cry" -&gt; B. Marley
Mom's are cryin
"Cause her son, has been shot down in the streets and died" -&gt; B.M.
Mom's are cryin

Back in the days, my momma used to cry
She ain't even think I was gon' graduate in high, school
FOOL, that's what I used to say
when them off-brand busters was mobbin my way
Nigga, whassup?!  This L.B.C.
Had shootouts in shop cause my focus G.D.
Back in ninety-three I still ain't gang free
I lyrical gangbang, "but it's just a G thang"
Now who wanna set-trip and flip?
I do my driveby of sorts with, hollow point thoughts
Don't get it twisted, foes ain't hollow, when I swallow
you into the hole, six feet under
I wonder, why you blunder then thunder crash
and ass gets burned to ash
Bullets are flying, asses are frying
and mom's will be crying, mom's are cryin

Mom's are cryin
"Cause her son, has been shot down in the streets and died" -&gt; B.M.
Mom's are cryin
"Woman lose her head and cry" -&gt; B. Marley
Mom's are cryin
"Cause her son, has been shot down in the streets and died" -&gt; B.M.
Mom's are cryin
"Woman lose her head and cry" -&gt; B. Marley
Mom's are cryin
Mom's are cryin</pre>
