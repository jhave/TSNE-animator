[Master P]
Motherfucker ask me what I think about a bitch
This ain't nothin' about a bitch nigga
I use a bitch like shoes you know what I'm sayin'
Bitch got old, get me a new pair

Chorus 2X

We dont love them hoes, can't trust them hoes
But just to keep it all good, just to fuck you hoes

[Silkk]
Just another day in a life of a G, drop the top on my I-Roc Z
Got dope in case the drousies got cash in my pockets
6x9 hitting just like Rockfords
Gold ones spinnin' as I pull out the driveway
Hit the backstreet cause it was too packed on the highway
Made a il-legal U-turn seen 5-0 coming my way
I thought they was gon' sweat, they said have a nice day
So a girl I haven't seen since Junior High School
say what's up with me and you
And she say it's all cool, well check this
I guess it's a date, picked up later on and hit it at the lake
Had a husband and kids but it ain't my fault
He must have not been hittin' it right
But she definetly got taught
Got ghost in my shit with the top down
Sideways, back to the town

Chorus 2X

[Silkk]
I'm at the crib just counting up my mon-ey
Ain't really tripping cause is a Sunday
I went to church girl and confessed my sins
And asked the lord can he forgive me for the things I did
I think of my children, so I call this girl up
Hello, is ya free in other words can I..
What, I mean can I see you later on a date
She said it was all good, so I guess I see you around 8
Grab my strap then i'm out the door
But before I go, Silkk sideways to the store
Walked in the store and grab some sheeking
Cause later on that night a brother went deep in
Woke up my sleep by some suckers dope, left on my answer machine
Why you stood me up
Pager keep going home but yo it ain't mine
Grab my clothes didn't waste no time
Left it like that, like a real G should
So next time, it'll be all good

Chorus 2X

[Silkk]
No a nigga can't trust no chick
A nigga can't trust a bitch
I can't trust a bitch as far as I can throw 'em
And that's about the same length as a nigga blow 'em
X to the next, no love just straight sex
And when i'm going diving I got to have my latex
Just to let you brothers know, don't put you life in these hoes' hands
Cause nigga can't trust a hoe

[Master P]
Can't trust a hoe or a nigga or a bitch Silkk
The game is crazy but that's just how the cards are dealt
I went to jail, you think this bitch love me
She used to write me, say she thinking of me
But she don't try to play me like a punk
But I refuse to be some garbage in a garbage dump
She met another nigga now he's getting paid
They try to play me like a old dirty fade
But I can't be faded, pre-meditated
Kill a bitch and fled with the babys to another set
Smoke 'em like a cigarette
Cause I'm in here deep like a bullet-proof vest
So I'm down for the count like who ride
Ain't nothing but my nina on my motherfucking side
It aint a bitch, got 17 rounds in it
Don't give a fuck about you hoes
cause I'm a run a fucking clown with it
On the set cause i'm a G bitch
You try to play i'm a play you trick, cause I'm deep
Fools gotta creep,
that's how it is from the 95 to the, 2003 motherfucker
Can't trust these old dog-ass hoes out here though man
You know what I'm sayin'

Chorus 2X

[Master P]
Yeah, but I can't forget about my motherfuckin ??? bitch
out the in motherfuckin Kansas
Livin' like a gangsta
Another hoe in Cincinatti you know what I'm sayin'
That's realer than real
A bitch down there in Colorado
Even got a bitch down there in Alabama fool
Milwaukee, Miami
I took one ???
It's all good though, you get a back rub</pre>
