[Tragedy Khadafi]
What I write is a haze dutch dipped in leak
Silence is a G's code so I barely speak
Like a Scorsese flick
Leonardo when 'The Departed' of Killaz Theme
Mentally ill, so retarded
By them liners, y'all niggas can't fuck wit my lines
Tear shit up like emptying clips from two .9s
It's just embedded in my artery
In my veins, you can say the game is a major part of me
Simple and plain
I got killaz on my left side, hustlaz on my right
Supreme Court indictments over my head when I write
Wishing life had a greater purpose
Niggas think the shit is all good
But that's the shit you see on the surface
I'm going thru the struggle life is a hustle, I ain't lying
Baby brothers in the can, sister is on the verge of dying
My soul is crying yet I still rep till it's done
Any song that I touch I embrace the track
The most intimate vision, what it is to be black
You know I write it so I live it and what's realer then that
