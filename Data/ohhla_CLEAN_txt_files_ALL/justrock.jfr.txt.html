Each and every day when I come home from school
Like clockwork I go up into my bedroom
I secure the door and it's the moment of truth
I flip on my sound system and let the bass loose
The earthquake bass makes the walls all tremble
A discotheque is what my room resembles
How loud it gets to me it does not matter
I open up the windows so the glass don't shatter
The blast falls off my neighbour's wall
My phone rings of the hook with complaint phone calls
But I just let it ring and I don't go near it
I turn the volume up so that I can't hear it ring
My ear drums rumble my lungs vibrate
I'm in my own world and this realm is great
We rock this power at my command
The decibels exceed the limits human ears can stand
The lower frequency better known as bass
Sitting nice with the treble at a jazzy pace
My neighbours complain they say they can't endure
They form a congregation outside my front door
Mothers who yell saying its too loud
Start banging on my door to turn it down
My response to my mother when she starts knockin
Is come on mum I'm just rockin

[Rockin']
[Ready, rock C]

This style that's mine is rarely heard
Suddenly there is an opportunity to observe
People gots my rhyme the super computer
The literary genius rhyme ruler of the future
I'm the fresh prince slaying all emcee
So hold the red cup when we take to your knees
Pay home submit you can't defuse my scheme
Cause I'm the fresh prince and this is my regime
To all other rappers you're being subdued
I don't mean to be rude but this is my prelude
This introductory performance has just one plot
A sample jeff and about me and my DJ rocks
I'm not listening to reason so don't try to talk
Do yourself a favour and take a walk
Or I'll amputate your mic and repossess your core
I'm the man salute to the prince the power lord
My friends I'll mangle you if we tangle put my arms in your asophogus and

I'll strangle you
I'm the messiah or rhymes the verbal gladiator
I'm like a bomb and my turbo is the detonator
The crown chief of the poetry industry
Vocabulary that to others is a fantasy
highly respected by the public at large
The prince will rock is taking charge
I'm like a tiger in a battle field I'm invincible
You want a battle me man be sensible
I'll never submit to any other emcee
Be a duel to the death either him or me
And as I verbalise to my DJ's cut
If we kill a wack crew or two so what
We just rock it

We just rock it
DJ Jeff
Break 2

On each occasion that I perform
The force captures my body like a magical storm
Suddenly I'm rendered helpless in a state of shock
But it is rather abrupt when I start to rock
Adrenalin rushes my ego swells
And the yells of the crowd make my hype excel
My metabolism quickens my body gets sense
That's when I metamorphosise into the royal fresh prince
And as I display all my lyrical beauty
You become a slave as your hype increases
And as I vocalise I can see it in your eyes
You stand up as your enthusiasm levels rise higher and higher beyond the

mark of red
You scream oh my to what the prince just said
As my energy is drained from being so crushed
All of a sudden I get another adrenalin rush
It happens each and everytime that my dj spins
More commonly known as my second wind
The spotlights are beaming
You are screaming
From my body all the sweat is streaming
Commanding the stage
And perpetually frayed
Giving my all to the pulse of
One hundred percent everytime I rhyme
When I step off the stage that's when the stop
And that has been the account of the evenings events
Reporting to you live by me the fresh prince
I'm the latest that you heard so you may seem shockin
(what does it all mean)
I'm just rockin
Rockin rockin rockin

Go crazy
