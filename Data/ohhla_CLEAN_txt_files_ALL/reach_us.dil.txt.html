Yo
I kill ciphers
That's how I went from good to God
I ain't perfect, yet n' still the hood is ours
And it's worthy, good people here work good and hard
But the news really only shows crooks and stops
It hold you for commercials and talk you into buyin shit
I was taught to learn from life and learn from my environment
Rocka walks the street as the son of a preacher
Who's the son of a preacher with people tryin to reach ya
I visualize the rise and realize the falling
High as time flies I recognize the calling
Went from lavish life to savage life back to lavish life
But never average, might be caught like Christ for the sacrifice
I still roll up my trees
For ? I meditate to roll up my sleeves
We adjusting readjust
I said I touch the world and the world said

Reach us
Reach us
Open up the world people ?

[Evidence]
You know these days ain't gettin any longer
Now, it's do or die
Now or never, time to hit the street
We on the move
Ride out with shit to prove
Everywhere we go they like:
It's a green light for you
Got lyrics about pleasure some about pain
From Southern Cali where they say it never rains
It's different dames that make me count blessings
We burn for our peeps that ain't here as we sing
Reach us
In God we trust no doubt that's a must
A hundred times see us but still catch the rush
And when we fly bless the sky
Let your mission unfold
You in the car we in the bus bless the road
How could I reach you if I wasn't real
Might have to go before you really studied the flow
And understand the deal
This year fuck before mad, loud  and clear
You know that's the truth they can't

Reach us
Reach us
Say this cause I mean it from the heart
Reach us

[Evidence]
Yo
What happened to me, nah what happened to you
The crew ain't changed the numbers the sames
The lack and the fools, the check for Cali dimes down to Georgia peaches
At our shows to book us, ? is how you reach us
Got ho's girls I see got queens
Got friends got enemies and in-betweens
Teacher are students, students are teachers
Low key or prestigious I reach you, you reach us
I see lines around the block in the snow it's cold now
I see people gettin hot when the shot is sold out
I see dime pieces to the front to rap along
To every word, word for word to every song
I raise every head and every arm
In every jam from every stage we stand on
People climbin over barricades and still
I tell security chill, they only tryin to

Reach us</pre>
