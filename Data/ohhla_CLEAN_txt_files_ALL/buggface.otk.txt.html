"Can I dance?" {*echoes*}
[unfamiliar voice]
Awww shit {*echoes*}
{*whispered*} Big Boi! Big Boi!

[Big Boi]
What if everything you ever knew or known was lost?
The knees'll tend to freeze when you gatherin yo' thoughts
You pause for the cause, try to recall and remember
but the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center
'Cause ya mind ain't free
Constricted by the muthafuckin boundaries, an ounce of fee
or a pound of 'dro couldn't place you on the planet where I'm transmitting
Life from Bro Bra, bruh Brother Braham
Cadillac on vogues, strike a pose, then the door slam
Wham nigga, wham! Don't they say that in their showdown?
Fo' sho' man, you acting like a tack pulled out of floor mats
You know I guess the truth, hit the booth, be makin more jams
Spreading strawberry preserves on ya nervous program
(Fuck the learning curve) We took our ramp to No Man's Land
Hello? Is anybody home? Is anybody giving dome?
Serve me up, I want some

[Chorus: 2X]
Buggface, toe jam
(Frown ya face up, 'cause we don't give a jam)
Jam to the jam, go jelly to the jam
(Imagine me not jamming, shove it up ya monkey jam)

[Big Boi]
When I'm left alone, I get to thinkin to myself
The mind is a terrible thing to waste, so use it 'til none left
Like everything is alright, clearly tight to def
I can see clearly now, analyzing every step (step)
Clearly you can feel me 'cause it's beating through yo' chest (chest)
And you can see me clearly through the window, paint drip but wet
With no tint, not deject.. clearly I'm a vet
And not no veterinarian but clearly pit bulls are the best (are the best, are the best)
Like the O.U.T.K.A.S. clearly nigga you know the rest
And if you actin like ya don't, then clearly nigga you tryna test
Crystal clearly I confess and I suggest you clear the runway
'Cause the ticket is a one-way, (clearly) back we won't be coming
Bugg!

[Chorus] w/ variations
"Can I dance?" {*echoes*}
Oh shit, Bamboo! You gonna break.. get outta here, you 'bout to break somethin!
(Stop!) Y'all just playing around now.. y'all just playing around
Come on Cross! (what?) You can hear the music from there</pre>
