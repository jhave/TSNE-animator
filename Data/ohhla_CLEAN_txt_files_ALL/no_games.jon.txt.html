[Chorus]
I ain't really here to play no games, Girl
You already know my name, Yeah
Freaky deaky cause it ain't no thang, Yeah
(Girl singing)
I ain't really here to play no games, Girl
You already know my name, Yeah
Freaky deaky cause it ain't no thang, Yeah
(Girl singing)

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Ain't no tellin' what a bitch will do
For the doe, She'll probally get on four and fuck the crew
Down south, Up north be the same ass bitches
Man locked up but mama watchin' the children
Talkin' bout my neck my back
Bitch you better learn how to chop rocks if you wanna get with Crack
Ughh, I been in love once, at least I though that
'til I fucked around and hit a broad back
Got burnt, Now you figure the rest
Dick hurt like I'm pissin' baugettes, now I'm livin' depressed
Should have known better than to trust a hoe
Especially she wanna know how much doe you hold
Cause there ain't too many real bitches
If you got one hold on, don't wanna be nobody's meal ticket
And you know it don't mean shit to me
Cause you know, Bitches ain't shit to me
What

[Chorus]
I ain't really here to play no games, Girl
You already know my name, Yeah
Freaky deaky cause it ain't no thang, Yeah
(Girl singing)
I ain't really here to play no games, Girl
You already know my name, Yeah
Freaky deaky cause it ain't no thang, Yeah
(Girl singing)

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
You see the problem is them busta ass niggas you been fuckin' with
Always bought ya shit, But never taught ya shit
Did he ever tell you some things that a playa do
And made you aware that life is more than a hair dew
Boy I tell ya, Best to deal with them real niggas
And stay far away from fuck niggas
Don't be a sucka, Hell atleast not from nothin'
All this suckin' and fuckin' a bitch better have somethin'
I need something that is compatiable
Not nothin young and dumb and full of cum, But one thats edible
I bet a, Nigga like T Double
Get it wetter, Suck and fuck'em better than the average nigga
I need a girl thats into tryin' thangs
So I can put it in her mouth, Fa real ain't into mind games
I know shes a mama girl and I'm a street nigga
Once we get together, I'll bet you she'll sleep better

[Chorus]
I ain't really here to play no games, Girl
You already know my name, Yeah
Freaky deaky cause it ain't no thang, Yeah
(Girl singing)
I ain't really here to play no games, Girl
You already know my name, Yeah
Freaky deaky cause it ain't no thang, Yeah
(Girl singing)

[Verse 3: Lil Jon &amp; Big Sam]
(Lil Jon)
A-T-L nigga, Shawty pimpin' how I put it down
Grindin' hard everyday, Chevy ride through ya town
23's on the truck, Ask me if I give a fuck
Rally's on that 75, Rollin' up 85
Lookin' for some cut like you
Tryin' to see what you gone do
Shawty I ain't playin no games
I ain't tryin' to be yo mayn
I just wanna cut you up, Slice you up like cold cuts
Lay you down and eat you up, Jonny slong up in them guts
(Big Sam)
See I'm something like a freak, Part time pimp
Big block Chevy rider all through Decatur
Wanna know my name, Well its Big Sam
And I play no games with these hoes cause the lame
Lemme break it down, Tell ya right now
If ya see me in ya town its goin' down
And all I want to do, Is cut you and ya crew
So let me know whats up with ya girl and you

[Chorus]
I ain't really here to play no games, Girl
You already know my name, Yeah
Freaky deaky cause it ain't no thang, Yeah
(Girl singing)
I ain't really here to play no games, Girl
You already know my name, Yeah
Freaky deaky cause it ain't no thang, Yeah
