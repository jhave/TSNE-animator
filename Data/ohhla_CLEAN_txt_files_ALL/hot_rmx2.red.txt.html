[Verse One: Red Cafe]
I'm the hottest in the hood, chick game silly
Chick hand in my draws tryin to Free Willy
Now all y'all really tryin to rhyme like me
Boy verse fly like I wrote in on the plane
Huh! Push weight no Royce
Now the check cleared Shakedown, Bad Boy
Hottest in the world, hottest in the game
Rap King James I'm a put it on the chain
Big hog at the valet DAMN
Get 'em on they toes like it's ballet DAAAAAAAMMMMMMNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!
Yeah! I get my 2Pac on
Thuglife hottest in the hood dot com

[Verse Two: Juelz Santana] (*Red Cafe)
Aight, I'm the hottest in the hood, yeah I'm that nigga
Ya girl wanna follow me and I don't mean Twitter
Said she got a deep throat and I'ma make her hiccup (HIC!)
I'ma make her feel me in her stomach like sit-ups (Ai!)
Take her to the crib, +screw drive+ 'er like Phillips (yeah)
Then I just hop in my hot con-ditcher
Back to the money, yea to drop off some pick-ups
First I do the drop-offs, then I do the pick-ups
Tryna get richer, quicker, the day I stop gettin it
That'll be the day they stop printin it, nigga
(*WHAT ELSE) I act then look like I'm really rich
(*WHAT ELSE) You act then look like an idiot 

[Chorus: Red Cafe]
And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on
And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on

[Verse Three: Lore'l]
I'm the hottest bitch, in the hooood
Ask around, I got that good
Make 'em say UGHHHHH, to the na na-nah
Behind the ropes so you know I don't fuck with y'all (Nah)
I ain't gotta turn on my swaaaaag ("Turn my swag on")
Tagged up, pink LD bag
Red Bottoms sick, make y'all hoes mad (y'all mad)
My man in the new GQ mag (Navy Seal)
I'm so fly that I got jetlag
That's your guy? - Oh, my bad
Yes I'm that, whip two-seated
He wanna lick the w/rapper, I'm gonna let him eat it

[Verse Four: Lloyd Banks]
Uh! Soon as it stops snowin I'm a pull out the 'rari
It looks like a spaceship sounds like a Harley
I'm brighter than a light highlight of the party
High like I'm a Marley all white in Bulgari
All type of Bacardi I'm a have me a orgy
Me, you, her and her to record me
Tomorrow mornin I'm a have a beautiful story
I ain't have to do much they was doin it for me
My formula proper I'm stronger than Vodka
Rose' copper I told her to chop her
My whip game proper my kick game soccer
Audubon driver I'm the six lane hopper

[Chorus: Red Cafe]
And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on
And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on
I'm the hottest nigga, in the hooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!
I'm the hottest nigga, in the hooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!
I'm the hottest nigga, in the hooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!
I'm the hottest nigga, in the hooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!

[Verse Five: Busta Rhymes]
Ay nigga, MY MONEY LOOOOOOOOOONG!!! I got a house on Jupiter, mayne
As a result of bein hotter than a nuclear flame
So hot wit it nigga, I'm disrepectfully blatant
I'm the hottest in the hood like we goin to visit SATAN!! (WHOO!!)
Hehehahah! - You ain't nicer than me, neither
Busta Rhymes, international fire breather
When I step in buildings, I'm something you gotta see
Here's a question from the fans - WHO THE FUCK HOTTER THAN ME?!
(OHHHHHHHH!!!!)
