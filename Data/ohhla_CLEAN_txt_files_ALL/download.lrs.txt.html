It's 2006, the consumer's still pissed
Won't take it anymore so I'm writing a list
Don't try to resist this paradigm shift
The music revolution cannot be dismissed
$18.98 Iggy pop CD
What if I can get it from my sister for free?
It's all about marketing Clive Davis see
If fans buy the shirt then they get the mp3
Music was a product now it is a service
Major record labels why are you trying to hurt us
Epic's up in my face like don't steal our songs Lars
While Sony sells the burners that are burning CD-R's
So Warner EMI hear me clearly
Universal music, update your circuitry
They sue little kids downloading hit songs
They think that makes sense
When they know that it's wrong

chorus
Hey Mr. Record man the joke's on you
Running your label like it was 1992
Hey Mr. record man your system can't compete
It's the new artist model file transfer complete

I know I'mrhyming fast but the message is clear
You don't need a million dollars to launch a career
If your style is unique and you practice what you preach
Minor Threat and Jello both have things to teach
I've got G5 production concept videos
Touring with a laptop rocking packed shows
The old-school major deal it makes no sense
Indentured servitude the costs are too immense
Their finger's in the dam but the crack keeps on growing
Can't sell bottled water when it's freely flowing
Record sales slipping down 8 percent
Increased download sales you can't prevent
Satellite radio and video games
Changed the terrain it will never be the same
Did you know in ten years labels won't exist?
Goodbye DVDs and compact disks

chorus
Hey Mr. record man what's wrong with you
Still living off your catalogue from 1982
Hey Mr. record man your system can't compete
It's the new artist model file transfer complete

You know we just wanted a level playing field
You've overcharged us for music for years and now we're just trying to find a fair balance
I hate to say it butwelcome to the future
