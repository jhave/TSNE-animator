Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Whack niggas sleep rappin' and woke up in trouble
Whack niggas with that sleep rap and then woke up in trouble
You were cool ten years ago, you fucking lex bubble

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Brand new tires, Rollin down the same old strip
New party same old chicks
I'm so sorry
If I don't look happy to be here
In your label office but they said I can't smoke weed here
Man fuck it I'm out black on
And I'm bout it fool
I got a studio in my house
Along with some the perks
That come with my work
Pretty twenty something sleeping in my Diamond Supply shirt
There is not a adjective to describe how I work
Hard is not enough brother I'm tougher
Whack niggas with that sleep rappin' and woke up in trouble
You was cool ten years ago you fucking lex bubbles, bubble
You gotta know when to hold em', know when to fold em'
Learn how to roll with the punches
Take em' to school give these niggas brown bag lunches
If it ain't the jets then it ain't nothing

[Chorus: Yasiin Bey a/k/a Mos Def]
Yo the king closed his cloak the set was overfull
Such a excellent moment, so emotional
He rushed out on the field, so devoted for
Final victory clutch they went postal cold
Glory overload, hold up hold my coat
Please remember this day
This changes everything we can do anything
Until you show anyway

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
My momma told me, "Son, always call a spade a spade"
Be like Chuck D never be like Flavor Flav
But that clock around his neck is so fly
And the way he complimenting Chuckie with that bow tie flow
Make me feel high so I'm gon' spit it my way
Excuse me as I do me cruisin' rudely down the high way
I'm young, black, intelligent, elegant, blasÃ©
Back to the thesis
Back to to shooting kraps and talking smack to the polices
Back to black and gold ballys
Dickes with the creases
Pulling youngins by the coattails
Schoolin' em' who the beast is
I pray this flow is dumb enough ugh
I pray my heart is DMC and Reverend Run enough
Cause I'm a throw my number up
I'm a throw some chicken bones and feathers on a hundred bucks
And summon up the thunder what?
The voodoo man is coming bruh
Can't see the forest for the trees
It's okay, I got my jigsaw and my lumber truck
Tell them boys their run is up

[Chorus]</pre>
