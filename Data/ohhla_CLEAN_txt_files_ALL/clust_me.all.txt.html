Remix! Let me get some of that
Remix! Clusterbombs are like rappers
You gotta rep this for me

[Alltruisms]
Clusterbombs are like rappers, we were all meant to blow
But didn't happen without enough spins, even so
One day, someone comes across a lost forgotten object
Picks it up long after the bomber first dropped it
C'mon, put me on kid, I know what you been thinkin
You wanna blow your mind listenin to cluster munitions
You're frustrated with the system, wishin people in power didn't hate you
This is different, I'm here to liberate you
I should have exploded on impact with the ground
But no one heart my sound until you found me here now
Freedom fighter from a new recorded world order
Four corners of the globe spread the message to your borders
No censorship distance or foreign army could stop us
Our weapons target hearts and make prophets
Which explains how realistically
Pop culture is the most successful export in human history
Hide new shit which is linked to I, year after year
We influence the world with our ideas
In cities and villages, you could live under the ground in a cave
and know our effort of love and pain
People are one in the same, we're not gonna stop makin art
A part of our lives, rock hip-hop soccer
Escape and love it, expression makes it human
And the old ways are okay but this is new and cooler
We're consumers, producers every hour
The U.S. is the best in the West the last global superpower
Now I find it encouraging, also a little scary
Power means to me as much as it does the military
Forever bend the world I landed after I dropped
However long it's been since the war officially stopped
You're about to feel me NOW God damnit
Alltruisms set to detonate recorded origins a clusterbomb rapper
