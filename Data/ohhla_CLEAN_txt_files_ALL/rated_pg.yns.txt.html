[Qur'an]
Parental discretion is not advised
You don't have to cover your ears and close your eyes
Cause this is r-a-t-e-d PG
If you ain't with it, see me
I drop rhymes, pardon me Sonny
Your style's gonna fizzle like Monopoly money
Steppin up -- is not healthier
Cause I'm a smooth brother from Philadelphia
The Q to the u to the r-a-n
Pass the mic once again
I'm a Youngsta, but I'm still live, man
Until next time I'm Audi 5 grand

(Kids don't need to hear all of that on a rap)
(Yeeaah boyeee)

[Taji]
First things first, before I kick a verse
I rehearse and make sure I don't curse
Try not to miss it
It's legit, of course not explicit
It's sort of dope, I hope you could peep this
It's rated PG, so you don't have to bleep this
I'm a juvenile, far from a criminal
This is straight up, nothin subliminal
Turn up the (volume) and let the bass thump
Give me the mic and watch the whole place jump
P-e-a-c-e
I'm signin out, little Taji

[Tarik]
Once the plug is in the socket, I put the mic in pocket
Suckers can't knock it, so instead they jock it
Style that I'm revealin will have you all feelin
Like you wanna dance and maybe wanna jump to the ceilin
This is somethin smooth, not too hard for your ears
This jam, I dedicate it strictly to my peers
So check it, you thought I couldn't wreck it
You probably would have never expected
A brother my age to rip the stage
So listen up as I turn the page
Rhymes comin atcha in 3D
Cause this is rated PG</pre>
