[Intro]
Oooooooo [4x]
Yeah, T-Pain, Bow Weezy
T-Pain sing to em

[Chorus]
Ohhh,
Baby, they can all say what they want cause you make it do what it do (Do what it do [3x])
But you just keep living ya life and they keep wasting time hating on you (Hating on you [2x])
They be hating on you, hating on you, hating on you
And they get mad when you win cause that's when they lose, that's when they lose, that's when they lose
And you got better shit to do with your time

[Verse 1]
They hating on ya, because they know you bad
Must be doing something right, if you got these bitches mad
She never met her pops he left when she was five
Now she 19 stripping enough just to pay the bills
A single parent mom know it gotta be hard
Plus her baby daddy never seen the kid
She searching for love and she say that it's tough
Because she dances it's hard to find a man
And between all that she still in school
Using college as a back up plan
And like Pac said, keep ya head up
I know it's hard at times, you get fed up
But don't let up, gotta stay strong
But whatever you do just don't give up
Don't worry bout em, just do you
Stay focused, get on your grind
Just know that you can call on me
Whenever them niggaz get out of line
And see a good friend is so hard to find
Somebody who down to ride
The best is yet to come for you
Don't let nobody steal your pride

[Chorus]
Ohhh,
Baby, they can all say what they want cause you make it do what it do (Do what it do [3x])
But you just keep living ya life and they keep wasting time hating on you (Hating on you [2x])
They be hating on you, hating on you, hating on you
And they get mad when you win cause that's when they lose, that's when they lose, that's when they lose (That's when they lose baby, yeah)
And you got better shit to do with your time

[Verse 2]
You done came up, that's why everybody done changed up
You would think you worked at Gold's gym
The way you done stepped your weight up
Got a new man and got a new life
She bout to become a new wife
Looking like a new woman
Feels like you been blessed twice
Done stopped dancing and graduated
All it took was a little patience
Never mind how you got here
Just know that you finally made it
I'm just living in it but it's your world
You deserve it, you worked hard, you ballin' now
Got a new car, no car note, cause it's paid off (Damn)
I'm proud of ya, (proud of ya) you came a long way (Yeah)
And if you need some inspiration
Just let this song play
Because a good friend is so hard to find
Somebody who down to ride
The best is yet, to come for you
Don't let nobody steal your pride

[Chorus]
Ohhh,
Baby, they can all say what they want cause you make it do what it do (Do what it do [3x])
But you just keep living ya life and they keep wasting time hating on you (Hating on you [2x])
They be hating on you, hating on you, hating on you
And they get mad when you win cause that's when they lose, that's when they lose, that's when they lose
And you got better shit to do with your time

[Hook]
Aye, let em, let em, let em hate
That's why they hating girl, you winning so don't pay em no attention
Let em, let em, let em hate
Jealous of ya cause they can't be in your position
Let em, let em, let em hate
That's why they hating girl, you winning so don't pay em no attention
Let em, let em, let em, let em hate
jealous of ya cause they can't be in your position

[Chorus]
