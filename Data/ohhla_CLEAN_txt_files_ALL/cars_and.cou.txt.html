[Boots]
Now if ya gettin' in my car don't sit down right away
Cause my passenger seat tilts sideaways
And don't even try to lean the shit back
The whole damn thang'll fall off the track
Stick your hand out, and signal for a right
My window's stuck plus I got a broken turn light
Naw I ain't dippin'! Sometimes I get a stuck brake
Got my rearview attached with some duct tape
Keep yo' knee right there!
I'm tryna keep that glove compartment closed playa!
The seatbelt don't work just tie it round your waist
If you crash through the window just cover your face
The radio gets one station on AM, it's Chinese
but if you listed you could catch what they sayin'
Stop complainin' -- I heard what you said
So what the seat spring poked you in the leg?
Didn't know it stabbed you, but what you stompin' fo'?
You finna put yo' foot through that hole in the flo'!
Now what you say - you gonna sue me?
Awwww, because the baby hurt his leg and got a booby?
Now your feelings hurt, you wanna get up out my shit
Cool motherfucker, here you go, get yo' kicks
You need to act a little older!
If you want that do' to open you gon' have to use yo' shoulder
Get the fuck up out fool, you lose - why?
My car is better than yo' shoes

Chorus: *sung* (2X)

Now if you get in my bucket baby, you gotta sit on the flo'
And I ain't go no license you know, I'm tryin-a duck the po'-po' 

[Boots]
See me in the town you might think I'm a star
Every three months in a different car
Like the other day in a '81 Datsun
wit' my alternator rollin' shotgun
Or in the fall in a '88 Seville
Pushin' it wit my foot down the hill
Once I did a job, the lady didn't wanna pay me
So she offered me a hooptie instead, I said MAYBE
Cause it looked like it went through a war
Missin' a door, three out of four
Ain't bad -- but is it safe to drive?
I'll wait til payday, then make it live
Fixed the beat first cause that's my choice
A bucket wit' the beat look like a Rolls Royce!
Next week it broke down on the Bay Bridge
And lemme tell you that motherfucker dang-ress!
Had a hun'ed so I hit the auction block off
Got a seven-six Pinto wit' some knock offs
Catchin' buses be gettin' me to work late
And you know that slow down my pay rate
Down to zero
No alignment make it kinda hard to steer though
They need to pay me for all these adventures
Tell 'em to my grandkids when I got dentures
Makin' a buck really costs a buck fiddy
It's only that cheap if yo' cars shitty
Motherfuckers laughin' but it beats the AC transit blues
Shit, my car is better than my shoes

Chorus
