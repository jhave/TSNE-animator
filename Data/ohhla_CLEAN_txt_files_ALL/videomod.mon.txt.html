[Intro: Christina Milian]
We be up all night, up all night
This is love...
We be up all night, up all night
Don't give a fuck...

[Christina Milian]
Got my hands up high, so high
In the club (all night, all night)
All my girls turnt up, cups poured up
All the boys wanna touch, they can't get enough
This is love..
Think I'm in love..

[Interlude: Christina Milian]
Turn up, don't turn me down, just let my body go
I'm about to work right now, like in a video
I might make you twerk right now, like in a video
Like in a video, like in a video
Like in a, like in a, like in a video
Video {"We gon' get on down now!"}

[Chorus: Christina Milian]
{She pop that, pop that} video model
She turnt up, sippin' red out of that bottle
She pop that, like a video model
She turnt up, so I hit it from the bottom (twerk twerk twerk)
She twerk that, and I'm puttin' in dollars (twerk twerk twerk)
She turnt up like a video model (twerk twerk twerk)
She throwin' that ass like a video model (twerk twerk twerk)
Stay twerkin' that ass like a video model

[Intro] + [Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Uhh, I run this bitch
Girl I let you run your mouth, she say "But I don't run from that dick"
Alright I go so hard I put it down, I put it down, I leave a dent
I am just tryna get my fuckin' mile.. out of an inch
My ho a psycho-pathic with a fashion, habit
Shake that ass, bitch, shake that ass, bitch; you a video model, action
And cameras don't lie, you the truth; Christina Milian, you the truth
So if your man screw up, you need a nigga like me, I'll knock every screw loose
I'm just sayin', I'm not playin'

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne - over Chorus]
Turn up! Haha! Yeah, Tunechi
Yeah, gotta a couple screws loose
I gotta a couple screws, I got a couple screws loose
Yeah.... Young Mula baby! Young Mula baby!
