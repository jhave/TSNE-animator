If you don't dig this you
Defiantly aint from down here
Bounce with me

I'm from across the state of crunkest?
Even haters love this
Some of the coldest shit that's ever been published
Let's ride
Get em up in the front in the back
We countrified
Get them boy you???
Why
Represent your side with pride

Hey baby
Let's get the headboards banging
Box springs squeaking
Damn a bunch of speaking
Common let's get to freaking
The next night
Next show next city
Damn my man gonna
Be hot bout this hicky on my
Watch your mount
No VIP we be by the bar
Conversating with the superstars
"What you drinking on girl"
No Champaign just a bottle of crown
Better yet make it three we aint fuckin around

[HOOK]
In here, situations get crucial
They got no love for us
And the feeling is mutual

In here

Different sides and sets
I can believe nobody's got to fighting yet
So common

In here

We defiantly gonna put it down
People from all different parts of town
In here
Good girls get real naughty
Hollywood faces with them south side bodies
In here
People Rollin so hard they can't even talk
Mixed that liquor with them pill
Now they can't even walk
In here
They jock you just cause you entertain
The people come up at ya dog
Do the damn thing
In here
Try to separate it from real life cats
Hey man you got a problem
"Nah it aint even like that"
In here
Smoke so thick you can't even breathe
Can't even see and it aint even bothering me

[HOOK]
In here, situations get crucial
They got no love for us
And the feeling is mutual

In here

Different sides and sets
I can believe nobody's got to fighting yet
So common

In here

I held it down
From Mayberry to New York
Nothing changed
But the day and the date
On my time port
I snore like eagor
Roll like reagor [regal?]
As usual it's for all my people
Blacks whites can't forget
The Mexicans and Asians
The radio station
That keep my records in rotation
The club dj's fans that hold me down
From the metropolis
To the lil ol one horse town
Now let me hear them engines go vroom
Let me hear them speakers go
Boom boom boom boom
When we step up in the room
Give us room give us room
Elbow room give us elbow room
We don't want no trouble
Just be cautious when I'm approaching
I'm some what paranoid
Slightly claustrophobic
We roll in the old old old school
Candy classics bumping my home boy
Andy Mathis, ugly

[HOOK]
In here, situations get crucial
They got no love for us
And the feeling is mutual

In here

Different sides and sets
I can believe nobody's got to fighting yet
So common

In here</pre>
