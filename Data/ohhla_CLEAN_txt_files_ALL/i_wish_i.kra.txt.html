Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]

I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me
Everything's gonna be alright
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me
Everything's gonna be alright

I've been lost in Boston, Austin Texas is always sweet
I stumbled around that Texas town but I never left Sixth Street
You know it's always hard to keep my feet from tryin' to run away
And it seems I spent a lifetime tryin' to make everything ok

I wanna go down to see her
She's my little queen
I wanna go down to tell her
She means the world to me
I wish I was down to watch her
Play that tambourine
She always brought a smile to me
I'd do anything

I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me
Everything's gonna be alright

I wish sometimes that I could say she never told me so
And I'd walk a million miles on down the same old broken road
Now you can always reap just what you sew I know that's true
And I pray some day that I wake and my poor feet won't fit these shoes

I wanna go down to see her
She's my little queen
I wanna go down to tell her
She means the world to me
I wish I was down to watch her
Play that tambourine
She always brought a smile to me
I'd do anything

I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me
Everything's gonna be alright

If I listened closely I can hear it oh so clear
Like a south bound train like fallin' rain like a whisper in my ear
Everything I'd like to hear you know I don't hear much no more
But I know someday that you'll come my way and you'll walk right thru that door

I wanna go down to see her
She's my little queen
I wanna go down to tell her
She means the world to me
I wish I was down to watch her
Play that tambourine
She always brought a smile to me
I'd do anything

I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me
Everything's gonna be alright
