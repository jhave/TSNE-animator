[Chorus: T.Q.]
Just like a sunny day, I'm gon' shine
You betta cover yo face, or you'll be blind
Oh big shiny blades, that's how I ride
Just like a sunny day, watch me shine

[Baby]
Hey, eh, uhn-uhn-ah, uhn-uhn-ah hold on, ro, huh
You see them chrome on dem whodi?
Oooh-wee, bad mother fucker, chrome pipes, and chromed out mufflers
Paint my cars, and dip these rods
Re-do the inside, cuz stunna gon' ball
Shine my teets, when I hit these streets
Call hot boy Elvin, to slide me a piece
Slipped it girl, fed her some gas
I buh-a burn, I buh-a, buh-a burn ya ass
Brawlers, bars, and marble's garage
Minks on the floor, with them platinum toys
Its 500 degrees, its hot as fuck (uh uh-a, uh uh-a)
Believe me boy, my shit diced up
I stay one way, I play every day
Its February 15th, stunna, hows the day?

[Mannie Fresh]
Now if you believe, like I believe
We can get to the mountain top
We can achieve what Martin was talkin bout
Whats all the barkin bout?
I'm a man playa, on my two feet, thats how I'm walking out
Alot of these chumps niggas say I just bling too much
But alot of yall ain't doing nothing, y'all just dream too much
And all of y'all niggas ain't coming up to nuttin but a big ole zero
And in case you didn't know nigga, I'm the hood hero

[Chorus]

[Gotti]
Its like a sunny day, plus I'm getting money today
With no funny play, cuz I got the gun at my waist
And like stunna say, feeling like a hunter today
Million, mommy fine, but she got bumps in her face
But  it ain't nothing but a G thang baby
So I'ma hit it in the back of my Mercedes
We on dubs, its all love, this shit crazy
And Cash Money is the label that made me

[Mikkey - overlapping last verse]
Mikkey take em church, its on you what you take from this verse
We like a cedar, we just straight from the dirt
So its in us, we stuck, like its in us to
cock..that..thang..back..and dump
Please, you don't want it wit us
Now they say money makes the world go round
But for the right price,
Stunna said yo girl done with the opposite of up
More than music this is rap hustlin
This is money mackin and publishin
Death before struggling, thats shine daddy

[Chorus]</pre>
