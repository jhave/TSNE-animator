[Intro]
Blac Haze
Represent (ah ha)
My whole crew getting down, my whole crew getting down, check me out

[Chorus]

Blac Haze, get on down (ah)
Merciless g's get on down, (check me out)
EKG get on down, (ah) playa hatin on us 
How we sound

[Verse 1]
Niggaz don't understand what we all about
Tryin to sell a million records first week out (uh)
I put it down with the EKG, mad niggaz got beef, c day b
Waitin on us playa hatin on us
Niggaz better recognize a nigga on the rise
Don't want no trouble yo,
A nigga smoked out in the 6 double-o, where you at
Gettting down for the green backs
See im all about loot, I mean that, check me out
I floss with the cream of the crop
Betta peep game till my team don't stop
If a nigga want beef, we regulate, why wait?
Florida keys up to the tri-state
Make it hot, everybody know my name
Blac Haze, real nigga true to the game (come on)

[Chorus]2x

[Verse 2]
In the past they all try to bang with us
Now everybody wanna hang with us 
In the club, strictly vip, 
Moay crystal fly hoes by the pound
Back on the scene like disco
From Texas all the way to frisco
Niggaz talk shit, that's kid stress 
And a shout to my shorty out in the Midwest
Got love for me, and the way I put it down
Smokin mad treats when im off in your town
What chu know about me and getting crazy pay
Carribean cruising on the lazy day
EKG, that's my niggaz
C day b, hockin math figgaz
Blaze the weed, getting down to my last philly
You think you can fuck with us, really

 [Chorus] 2x

Party over here it aint over there throw yo hands up in the air 
 Get on down get on down, get on down get on down (2x)

[Verse 3]
Now I got mad honeys pagin me, 1 fo 3
On my frequency but she don't know me
Hoes n shows, but still keeping me a dime
Niggaz don't understand, they love the way I rhyme
As I crown, Billboard charts lett em know
At the same time niggaz hatin my flow
Who rock the ice, Cuban cigars
Never knew one day I'd be chillin with the stars
Fancy cars, free drinks by the spas
Smoking out,niggaz  chillin in the spas
My whole crew, in the manli? keys
Whats my name, Blac Haze and merciless g's
Made niggaz, floss the e-class
Always knew one day I'd see cash
Comin up all the way to the top
Betta this thang and rock (come on)

[Chorus] 2x

Party over here it aint over there throw yo hands up in the air
 Get on down get on down, get on down get on down,
(Repeats till end)</pre>
