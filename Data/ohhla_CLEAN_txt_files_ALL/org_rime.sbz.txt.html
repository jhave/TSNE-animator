[Intro: Shabazz the Disciple]
Gotta organize ya rhymes...
In these last days and times...
Word...

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Yo, this one goes out to all my brethren doing jail time
To all the brothers in the Hook doing fed time
A gun salute to all my brothers doing fed time
My uncle Cliff, Supreme and Havoc, Godfather Kline
Judges is hanging brothers, giving brothers, football numbers
TNT is scheming to knock your empire asunder
Three time felons, maxed out with no parole
Cuz Guiliani Illuminati, want the black man soul
Pataki be trynna smack me with his injection
See the black overdose, it gives him an erection
I got my style locked down like an inmate
Doing a bid up in this rap game, waiting for my release date
The CEO is like my P.O., it's like I'm on parole
And A&amp;R's up in my ass like a C.O.
The game is organized rime, comitting crimes and rhymes
When this product hit the street, the whole album is doing time
Facing the lethal injection for trafficking weapons
You get caught with my tape on you and get charged with posession
Cuz hip hop, things like gambling, high stakes hops
It's my turn to roll the dice and the God got the bank stocked

[Chorus 2X: Shabazz the Disciple]
The Gambino like Nino, rolling cee-lo in a hip hop casino
Cooking albums, hustling it like a kilo

[Shabazz the Disciple]
The record shops, my lyrical crack spot and I got workers
Super Beat Street, Music Factory and Jackpot
And shipping keys, overseas, and trampeling the profits
Cuz out there, hundreds is worth G's
The Red Hook Rockerfeller, with lots of mozzarella
Number one hip hop, rock seller for my acapella
And C-12, my secret service hitman
Choco and Carlito, export my lyrical parico by the shipment
Freestyle and Bless, they be my co-defendants
And General Tso's, Wayne and Jeffrey Garfield, are my lieutenants
The lyrical kingpin like Sinatra, I'm rocking crazy jewelry
Like Liberace, Pavarotti of the opera
With lyrical leaves of coco, your style is so-so
All these kilos make workers who be fronting mafioso
They bootleg my music like whiskey, this game is risky
Traffic and verbal heroin that's imported from Sicily

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro: Shabazz the Disciple]
Word, organized rime...
Lyrical narcotics, my style be the big eight that I'm hustling...
No doubt... C-12... you got 12 ounces on the scale right now
Word up... lyrical drug dealers... </pre>
