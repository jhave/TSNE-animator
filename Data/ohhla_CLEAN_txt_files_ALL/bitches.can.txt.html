Hot lyrics loop the beat and rock wit it
Go head slam the door in my face ill lock smith it
My box cutter blades rip it
Toxemic the loop is out for lyrics when we out for fire spit it
Put a high speed on the electrons limit light like quick googol bowlers
Hitting the wicked get jig
Fix my aperients take you to Paris
Cook diner on a taros for you and your parents
First impression what they think of me
Don't they like legume
Won't let you commit to me
Tell them that you're live with me
Tell them I dig you out diligently
And you thinking about giving up anything just to have twins with me
Turbo 911 98 degree weather engines wined as I push the leather
Pin you to the leather I can prove I can love in 3 seconds
So let me pull over and check your P.S.I presser

New and improved updated sex pistols
Clamp your nipples
The betty ass sample
 Leave your kidney crippled
Cherry pickle lift you flip you like a nickel
Scream and stay word girl I'm a keep wiping you
 Eyes wide shout that word it's a dealy yo
At R Kelly show showing his home amateur video
Produced by a pinto at the house
 The custodian of recorders is me not Mari Cabal
 The best job in the world
 Besides touring around with Jagged Edge
With something whole coroner round
 Rhythm &amp; Blues get all the kuch kuch
 No doubt and when I'm singing R &amp; B this is how it sounds

[Canibus] Singing

Young lady you look so fine I cant turn my eyes away the way you look in the launderette and a... .

She wanna make it in her mouth
 With the ta ta busting out show her what's love about
 Spend the budget and bounds
 No one would know she is going down south it don't count
 Cause I never met a striper that respected her spouse
 Beat her ass as soon as she steps in the house
 What she a spec
 She kissing him with D.N.A we left in her mouth
 She blaming it on the drugs and the vine
Club seen is obscene I told you umpteen times
 You want to be an actress
 Why you proud of her haven't shit change but the dick sliding in and out of her
 Ain't nobody looking out for her
 The appointment with the casting coach counselor is really just about a nut
 Aint no photographer taking no snap shots of her
 With no car board cut out camera for 20 dollars
 Why that bitch telling you she got the part
 She got spit starch on somebody's boxer shirts you heard
