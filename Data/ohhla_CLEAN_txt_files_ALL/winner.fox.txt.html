[Intro - T.I. - talking] (Justin Timberlake) [Jamie Foxx]
T.I.P. (yo, uh)
Aye Jamie, JT [oooooooh]
I'm 'bout to get back hot again man
You know I'm fresh out that thang, let go (talk to me)
[You know you lookin at a winner, winner, winner]
I'm so up there and so out there, you so not here
Hey, hey, you see we so up there and we so out there
(Uh, yeah, let me get it right here first, hey!)

[Verse 1 - Justin Timberlake]
Im wakin, up in the morning
Hustlin to the stage, if I've been performin
Bustlin through the hay and bustin the door in
Lately nothin messes up my step and scorin
And speakin of the Misses, Im watchin 'em pour in (uh)
Just like a drink that Im enjoyin
And dont mean bottles, you welcome to join in
Just look at me soarin, feelin like Jordan

[Break - Justin Timberlake]
(Aaah-ah) hold up I aint finished yet
On the top but you just dont get it yet
I dont get cut, I make 'em cut the check
Cant hear me in the stands, let me say it again
(Aaah-ah) You ain't heard Im the shit
On the top but you just dont get it yet
I never got cut but I make em cut the check
So hate on but guess what

[Chorus - Justin Timberlake &amp; Jamie Foxx]
I feel like I cant miss
I know they want me to fall
But aint nothin bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you lookin at a winner, winner, winner
I cant miss, cant lose, cant miss
You know you lookin at winner, winner, winner
`Cause Im a winner, yeah Im a winner

[Verse 2 - Jamie Foxx]
Im steppin out in the evening
Keep winnin and screamin
You gotta be cheatin but Im so breezy
I make this look easy
And y'all thinkin Im seasoned
You gotta believe me
I went from TVs to screens to DVDs
To CDs to MP3s overseas
I got, no time, the talking is boring
Just look at me soarin, feeling like Jordan

[Bridge - Jamie Foxx]
(Aaah-ah) hold up I aint finished yet
On the top but you just dont get it yet
I never got cut, I make em cut the check
Cant hear me in the stands, let me say it again
(Aaah-ah) You aint heard Im the shit
On the top but you just dont get it yet
I never got cut but I make em cut the check
So hate on but guess what

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
That's right, you see the, Porsche Panamera, got 'em in hysteria
The turbo super fast and that McLaren even scarier
Hear me turnin corners, burnin rubber in your area
I'm hard to follow once I pop the clutch and hit the throttle
I'm recession proof, I don't run the money, money run to me
In this economy, guess I'm considered an anomaly
You got is Maseratis, new Ferraris, I got one of each
My future bright, tight like the bitch you got in front of me
Turn pain to progression in every studio session
Passion into perfection, to failure I'm an exception
Fuck if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessing
You couldn't die at the hands of a better man
I ran from the bottom to the best, no Auto-Tune
Been in the lead, say you seen King follow whom
Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that
King back, money long as a old Cadillac (*laughing*)

[Chorus] - w/ T.I. ad libs

[Outro - T.I. - talking]
Hey man, you thought a little vacation was gonna hold me back homeboy
Man, I'm back man, brighter than ever
You understand that?
If you didn't like me then, ha, you gonna hate me now nigga</pre>
