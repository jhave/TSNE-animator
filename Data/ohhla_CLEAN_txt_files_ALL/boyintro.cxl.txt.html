(We made a choice...)

[Intro: Chino XL]
Yo we made a choice
Yo, that uh, our music is worth much more than you know
We hold it very dear to us (that's right)
And as time moves on and we see it slippin away
and y'all try to, pump, that same radio bullshit down our ears
500 thousand times a day (all day)
It just makes us hold on to that underground shit that much stronger

[Chino XL]
Yeah (is it like gold?) Yes!
(Is it like silver?) Yes! (Is it like diamond?) Yes yes yes!
It's like a precious medal when we hear a verbal rebel
murderin 56 bars or more and we hangin on every syllable
And when it's pure (is it like gold?) Yes!
(Is it like silver?) Yes! (Is it like diamond?) Yes yes yes!
It still raises hairs on the back of our neck when I hear a rapper rip
straight from his heart for the respect, not the size of a check
And when it's pure (is it like gold?) Yes!
(Is it like silver?) Yes! (Is it like diamond?) Yes yes yes!
When a beat bangs and reflects what hip-hop was built for
That wack shit y'all spittin back in the day y'all would get killed for
But when it's pure (is it like gold?) Yes!
(Is it like silver?) Yes! (Is it like diamond?)
Yes yes yes {*static*}</pre>
