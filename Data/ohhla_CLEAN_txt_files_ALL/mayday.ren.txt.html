Mayday, mayday, we're going down

Niggaz screamin' mayday 'cause Ren is kickin' ass like Pele
Makin' fools run like it's a relay
But ain't no fools runnin' sprints in shorts
It's just niggaz shootin' dice on the basketball courts
Waitin' for the day to get revenge for the days
Of the slave ships, ya got the bloods and the crypts
Unitin' puttin' guns together
To give white people stormy weather
But they can't hide under no umbrella
'Cause we be breakin' niggaz out the motherfuckin' jail cella
Fella, so who gives a hell of a about the man
The KK Klan
So here we go again scarin' people to death
Knockin' niggaz out with the indo on the breath
On the old english because we use fuckin' english
So you can understand now who's the man?
It gotta be me, I got the shit organized
So when you see us comin' don't be actin' surprised

(CHORUS)(2x)
Mayday on the frontline
Mayday, mayday, mayday
Mayday, mayday, mayday

Oh my God, he's been shot in the chest
Yo he's a redneck, huh, throw him with the rest
Of the dead bodies we be buryin'
With 2 million niggaz got guns, and carry 'em
Shoot people first and ask questions later
Just like a nigga was a terminator
So niggaz know what they oughta do
I won't bring up that Rodney King shit, 'cause that's through
Now back to the blue prints, behind the fence
A gang a niggaz strapped and it ain't no coincidence
Now it's time for the camouflage
And all the niggaz I can fit in back of the Dodge
Bound to go to war but this ain't the Middle East
We're killin' motherfuckers for revenge, fuck peace
So if ya see us, this is what ya do
Grab your shit and come along, we're killin' cops in blue
Even if the black cops are down wit' 'em
Those sell out motherfuckers, yo, we're still gonna get 'em
Because it's mayday on the frontline

(CHORUS)

Now I gotta play run away slave like a fiend
Because they got me on the TV screen
They said they wanted me dead or alive
'Cause I don't talk jive, I try to survive
Tellin' niggaz what's the deal on the streets
So they don't get caught up in a gang sweep
They gotta let 'em have it
Shoot 'em in the ass like a motherfuckin' rabbit
Because we're losin' altitude
Because they're getting shot down by a nigga with an attitude
Turbulence up ahead, yo
The storms getting thick, 'cause I'm a man with a big ass dick
Throw a grenade in their program
Let 'em know who I am, a nigga can jam
A little black nigga from the streets, over hip hop beats
With a glare and we're wearin' black sheets
Hope we don't burn shit in your front yard
We'll beat your ass down on the boulevard
So a band of shit, grab your parachute
'Cause niggaz comin' in khaki suits and steel toed boots
Stompin' motherfuckers in the way of the process
Or they might get a bullet to the chest
It gotta be me, I got the shit organized
So when you see me comin' don't be actin' surprised
Mayday on the frontline
