What?
You mean I'm ya second favorite famale rapper..
You crazy?
I'm better than most niggaz...Suck my dick

[Verse one]
There ain't a bitch as ill as me, no bitch as real as me
Shit, I live where the stealers, drug dealers, killers be
Don't give a fuck what y'all mothafuckas think of me
So fuckin what, fuck a slut if she ain't feelin me
If you a real bitch, then you love my shit
Turn out the lights, get ya man and fuck to my shit
Ride that dick, make him eat yo shit
Bust ya nut ma, light a blunt to my shit
I think it's some truth to that sex sells shit
Cuz bitches is so pussy...niggaz is just dicks (shit)
I'm so sicking, don't think cuz I smoke a lil more
than alotta weed that I'm slippin
As long as hos is still strippin, my flow is still flippin
Jewels'll keep drippin
And I'ma keep comin' through in that six wit the seats back shipment
Stop trippin bitch, cuz when I stop you lookin
It's no need for the ice grill you not in Brooklyn
Go 'head and act fool like you really wanna step to this
And I'ma put the tool right between ya two breasttess
And ain't shit that you can say to me when you be breathless

[Hook]
Young but I done did to
Too much shit
I smoke like an O a day
Nothing but the Dro and Haze
So you know I feel no pain
Now I gotta go away

[Dude talking]
Remy Ma
Offcial fuckin beat bodier
Who the fuck want it?
Niggaz? Bitchez?
The fuckin Bronx savior
The Queen of N.Y
The game's changing
She be on the rap for ya'll bitches
This doobie ya heard
BX dont get it twisted
Home of the killers, the dealers, the bombers and Remy
Martin..Rep that

[Verse two]
See I be trying not to swear to God
But I swear mothafuckas gon hear the squad
Y'all betta say a Prospect and Joe the God
Armageddon, Tony Sunshine and Remy Ma
About to take over the worls alrady run the Bronx
And if it wasn't for P, we couldn't be
So bless his heart, bless his soul
Make he rest in peace
Can I get a lil moment of silence please...
I never let him see me stress
Don't never try to disrespect
Nigga I eat, shit, sleep and breath TS
And if I love a nigga, Remy love a nigga ta death
