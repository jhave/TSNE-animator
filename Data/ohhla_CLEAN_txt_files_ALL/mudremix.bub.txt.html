Oh, twenty, man that plenty but I still want more
In a big-body ? on them twenty-four's

Take it to the cha-cha, got your damn top drop
Two color flip-flop, tinted red Collipark
There's hoes in the parking lot
But I still got my glock

Wonder who they hatin' on, think that baby this him

Now I'm fin' to build a wall to put another plaque on it
Don't gong it, cause I keep relentlessly spittin' that shit you into me
Cause I'm pigmented differently
Plus behind Tim on twenty-three's
Wow, just call me Bubba the beautiful
I'm the boss around this office, you a scrubbin' the cubicle
This ain't nothing illusional, boy, they token the tags
But since they all wanna hate, I give them all the ?
You know what we after, the cabbage and long somes
The true county Georgia baby, that's where they come from
And y'all little dumb-dumbs is skatin' on thin ice
Love to creates it but it's hatred, it is life
