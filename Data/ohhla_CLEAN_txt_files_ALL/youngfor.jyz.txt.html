[Mr. Hudson]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watchin the skies
Hopin for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young, or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sand pit, life is a short trip
The music's full of sad men

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young; I wanna be, forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young; I wanna be, forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever young?

[Jay-Z  over Chorus]
Uhh, Young!
Ay may the best of your todays
Be the worst of your tomorrows
But we ain't even thinkin that far
Knahmean?

[Jay-Z]
So we livin like a video (video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold, and the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty-ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, cause, there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm, forever young

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Fear not when or fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for livin not livin uptight, 'til you somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye-bye
So now for legends I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks over kitchen stoves over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations while debatin up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, show that the nigga from here
With a little ambition just, what, we can become here (yeah)
And as the father passed the story down to his son's ears
Younger get, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, ba-by

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Just let it run..
Slammin Bentley doors, hoppin out of Porsches
Poppin up on Forbes list, gorgeous  hold up
Niggaz thought I lost it, they be talkin bullshit
I'll be talkin more shit, they nauseous  hold up
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet? I'm paintin you a portrait of Young

[Chorus]  latter half</pre>
