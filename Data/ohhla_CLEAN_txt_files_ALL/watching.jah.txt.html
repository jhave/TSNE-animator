{Ja Rule}
Yea
Rule
Are you a figment of my imagination?
Or am I one of yours?
Believe me baby, an hear me, fear me, feel me
That's why they all wanna kill me dead
True in the head but nigga not
As soon as I get the drop
I pull up the pop of the test
It's outta the prairie
Bitches style juice running through my head
How many wanna die nigga?
my concept It's irrational
My thinking now
I'm erratic like Mike W's whose falling down
I'm losin sight now I can hardly see
And smoking all this fucking weed 
I can barely breathe
I'm like tell a bitch bleed
Squeeze on D
Run up in the deli 
wrung up on D

Are ya watching me?
They be watching, niggas they be watching, keep watching
Keep watching me
Now don't look down
Are ya watching me?
They be watching, Bitches they be watching, keep watching
Keep watching me
Now don't look down
Whose watching me?

C'mon watch as I creep through your block
in the hard top drop
with my bead on knock
cause cops i ain't standing
and gangstas know 
catching before hanging
And my dogs keep banging
cause ain't shit changing
And hustlers ya'll keep slanging
We stuck in the game 
wit not a lot to gain 
but everything to lose
but we soldiers that front-line
In days to rule
We do homicide drive-by's
Cock and spray
If you the last man standing
You about to lay
6 feet underground
Watch me now
Stop me how?
Ya'll niggaz trying to cop my style
I spit nothing but hot ones
and pop guns
make it hard for niggaz to function
Who want some of the Rule baby? (None of ya'll)
I'm legally considered crazy
But if that's the way that God made me
This world can't change me
And that's the way it'll be
Caught in the dark
Until the light shines on me
I'm a slave to this game
But I'm break free 
So keep watchin me</pre>
