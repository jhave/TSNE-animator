Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's the coolest of the coolest
It's the smoothest of the smoothest
It's the crudest and the rudest of the stupid kids
Mr. Vicious with his misses
Blowing kisses to his mistress
And his misses blowing riches like some hooligans
I wasn't tripping I just listen
To these women when they sipping on them juices
They say "Jaden yeah he's too legit"
And I be flipping cause they slipping
And they dipping in the pool they saying pool
And they be drooling cause I'm super rich
I might be tripping but I'm living how I'm living
I'm fourteen I'll be forgiven
So forget it bro I'm moving in
I don't care how you be getting all offended
Cause I'm taking all the women
Well I'm sorry bro I do it big
So just listen when I'm spitting
It's the realest that you getting
Of these writtens if you messing with the stupid kid
But if you isn't never get it
Cause I didn't mean to push you
If you want it and you need it girl then come and get it
Yeah

It's the coolest

I'm the leader of the leaders on the leader boards
We be winning when I'm spitting I don't need the score
I just eat you like a cheetah and it's getting boring
Spitting bars check the blogs if you need some more
MSFTS in this man what's the deal
Me, Moy and Matteo yeah that's the trio
About to get up on the stage cause we feeling ill
Chilling with ebony crew depending upon how I feel
Yeah
Cause the youth is taking over
Baby you can cry up on my shoulder
Sixer season ticket holder
And my flows are only getting colder
And I told yer
Click
That there's no other
Please you ain't messing with my Cs in the Suburbs
Getting beats from Ace everyone knows that's my brother
And teachers tell me walk but I really rather hover in the jamfest

It's the coolest

It's the wanna be ghetto kid
Yes I'm about to level with
All of my homies, all of my fellows
It's crazy
Man you messing with the MSFTS
Man I doubt that we gon' settle it
That's because lately
I've been sipping on a soda
And I'm chilling with a hottie and she's really into yoga
My baby
Love notice what I wrote her
And she kiss me on the lips every time a joker show up
But they see
Just a bunch of kids who don't know what love is
And think that we should wait 'til we get older
Huh maybe
But I'd rather swallow throw up
Cause I'm chilling with my girl and I doubt I'll ever grow up
But you know what? They ain't gonna slow us up
We the youngest, we the ones that know what's up
I'm an alien my flow is just so up-ductable
Conspiracy theories never go as up
I'm done</pre>
