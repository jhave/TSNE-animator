[Chamillionaire - Talking Over Insert]
Mixtape Messiah mayne (This is a pimp drill)
Color Changin' Click (This is a pimp drill)
Yeah!, Ay (This is a pimp drill)
(Pimp Drill, Pimp Drill) Yeah, Yeah..

[Hook - Chamillionaire]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, All my ballers get ya cups up
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, All my ballers get ya bucks up
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, If you broke nigga tough luck
Yeah, Yeah..

[Verse - Chamillionaire]
Chamillionaire, Color Changin' Click
Callin' all the ballers, pull ya wallet out ya fit
If you are not a baller, and you ain't 'finna tip
Go to the back and sit cuz you ain't 'finna see em' strip
If you ain't tryna holla, just wanna get some lip
You gotta couple dollars, then you might get ya wish
Somebody better call a, waitress hurry quick
Cuz I need a couple bottles, some Hennessy &amp; Cris'
Don't wanna hear ya problems, just wanna see ya tick
If ya graduated college where you learned to break a trick
Then show em' how to spit a little game and tell her this
Go put on a outfit some lip-stick and make me rich

[Ying Yang Twins Insert]
That hoe fine, but this hoe a killer
(repeat 4x)

[Rasaq - ad-libs over Insert]
Koopa say..
Ay, Uh-Ay, Rasaq Say..
Ay, Ay, Yung-Ro Say..
Twin say, Color Changin' Click baby

[Chorus - Chamillionaire]]
All off in the club, 5 vogues and candy doors
Then you know it's a pimp drill, this is the pimp drill
You got some money better spend it on these hoes
Then you know it's a pimp drill, this is the pimp drill
When I come through they all gon' break me off a show
Cuz you know it's a pimp drill, this is the pimp drill
You gotta problem with it let a nigga know
You know it's a pimp drill, this is the pimp drill

[Verse - Yung Ro]
-G'Yeah, Nobody!, Wussup!, G'Yeah
Yeah this baby muthafucka come walkin' on stage
Them tricks spendin' money, so she bound to get paid
Some money she blowin', some money she save
She know he wanna fuck and that's how she want it to stay
Cuz that's how she get paid, she see's him and please him
She gotta boyfriend, but she really don't need him
Cuz half the time she feed him, he a muthafuckin' roach
She wanna baller baller, that nigga is broke
G'Yeah, now everybody in the club gettin' tipsy
I'm sippin' sizzurp, Rasaq drinkin' whiskey
They give me the group, they love when I'm picky
You pop X, have hot sex and give head, you comin' with me

[Verse - Rasaq]
I hit it from the back, said she like it like that
I hit it from the front, took off her baby phat
Platinum in my mouth, and a skirt on my lac
My trunk is on drugs, cuz you know it's on crack
Nigga got plex, then we can handle that
Twin got the mac, click-clack and cock it back
She say she like a thug with a mouth full of gold
(It's Rasaq boy) Upside down when she slide down the poll (for Rasaq boy)
Climb to the top from the ceiling to the floor
from the floor to the stage, from the stage to the door
Drop ya panties hoe, let me see the peep-show
Make a playa grin til' you see them teeth glow
Yeah it's Rasaq, cocky nigga from the south
V.I.P. room let a nigga get some mouth
Let me see ya show-out, know what I'm talkin' bout
Let me have ya number, can I call ya at the house
Don't act lame, don't play no games
It's the Color Change, got the cranberry Range
Take it to the floor, let me see ya get crunk
Pop, Pop, Pop it like my popped-trunk
Skinny hoes get gon', let me see ya badunkadunk
My niggaz in the back, and we blowin' on skunk
Man!, Yeah..

"No matter what I say, do not tip strippers..haha"

[Verse - 50/50 Lil' Twin]
You slidin' down the poll, ya butt muscles is jumpin'
Walk the dog and show me somethin'
gimme a reason to blow these hundreds
You crawlin' like a lion, tellin' me come with ya finger
Make yaself cum with ya finger, touch ya tongue with ya finger
So kinky-rink and blink-me, what you thinkin'?, what you drinkin'?
XO got me feelin' like a kingpin, I ain't trippin' I'ma keep my thing in
I'm no tipper or tippers, no up-lifter or strippers
But you sizzle fa-shizzle, won't you un-zip my zipper
I sipped a lil liquor, 'finna flip and get some fiddles
Got cash like Jed Clappet, tip a stripper, lift a little
-You too uptight

[Chamillionaire - "Yeah, Styrofoam cups up, Pimp cups up"]

[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
All off in the club, 5 vogues and candy doors
Then you know it's a pimp drill, this is the pimp drill
You got some money better spend it on these hoes
Then you know it's a pimp drill, this is the pimp drill
When I come through they all gon' break me off a show
Cuz you know it's a pimp drill, this is the pimp drill
You gotta problem with it let a nigga know
You know it's a pimp drill, this is the pimp drill</pre>
