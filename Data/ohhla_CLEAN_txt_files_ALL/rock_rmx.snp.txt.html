Blame me, think they wired up because of Bus
Back up in this bitch see I been quiet long enough

Alot of strippers in this bitch get on the pole and grind
You reach with a option of purchase while I'm ownin mine

Skatin like I'm roller bladin on this motherfucker!!!
Every single word I utter niggas know it's butter
If you uncomfortable you'll probably need to hold your motthhhherrrrr!!!!!

Get turf stomped, fuckin with the turf punk

This little rappin ass, niggas tappin out

My niggas peeled up, the homeys growin big
I'm all in the club rollin twenty crips
You see a G, you better know the deal
You see the fellas fool, I'm in the streets for real

'Cause I'm a dog, hoe, give 'em the dick and dash
Fuck whatchu called fo', if I ain't hit dat ass

And when I'm in the buildin, they get to poppin up
They get to spendin cash, screamin T.I.U.
