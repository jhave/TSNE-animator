Song:   No Love
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

She said she want to stay together
I don't think I can ooh

[Verse 1]
Red light
You know I can't make this thing that official
Believe we had a great night but I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you, shit
You don't like that I make this easy, leaving
After sexing on the floor
Baby I know you need me, like I need you
But I'm the one you wanna love

[Chorus]
So just wrap a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like
You use to them but ain't no loving me
I hear what you would say and girl it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You probably go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party till we can't, ain't no loving me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me
So don't come looking for love

No love [x9]
Don't come looking for love
No love [x9]

[Verse 2]
Shorty if you looking for somebody tryna settle down
Probably won't be around, nah baby
You should hit when you tired of playing up in the house and ain't nobody around
You need that
When you need that late night
We can both make love to the daylight
You got it girl, you got it girl
But you know I can't stay right? Nah babe
All I want is you so what you tryna do?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Until the morning we can freak but baby girl you gotta know, know, know
We can rubble in these sheets but after this you gotta go, go, go
Don't take it personal
When it feel so good we cannot get emotional
But that is when you find out that it hurts the most
Since then I've been like trust nobody, show no love

[Chorus]</pre>
