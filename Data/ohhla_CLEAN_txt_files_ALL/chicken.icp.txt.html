Chicken Huntin'

[Violent J]
Well, I'm heading down a southern trail, I'm going chicken huntin'
Chopping redneck chicken necks I ain't saying nothing
To the hillbilly stuck my barrel in his eye
Boomshacka boomshacka hair jumps in the sky
Why I never liked chicken pot pie?
Or the chopped chicken on rye?
So tell Mr. Billy Bob I'm a cut his neck up
Slice, poke, chop chop, stab, cut
What can you do with the drunken hillbilly
Cut his fucking eyes out and feed em to his Aunt Milly
Willy Willy chicken neck, chicken hunting gotta love it
Hit him with the twelve gauge bucket, chicken nuggets
Laid out all over the grass
Then his little hound dog will eat em up fast
Last as long as you can my man
Cuz when that chicken head hits the fan, you got
Blood guts fingers and toes (3x)
Sittin front row at the chicken show so...

[Chorus]
Who's going chicken huntin, we's goin' chicken huntin' (3x)
Cut a motherfucking chicken up, right!

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Let me get a chicken sandwich with manwich
I'm finna wreck on a chicken neck
Chopping up Hilly and Billy Bob Billy
Cuz I chop motherfucking redneck silly
Peeked in his yard and what did I see
I seen a chicken boy fucking a sheep
I say "Mister Mister, what the fuck you trying to do"
Ah, Billy Billy Boo
Barrels in your mouth, bullets to your head
The back of your neck's all over the shed
Boomshacka boom chop chop bang
I'm 2 Dope and it ain't no thang
To cut a chicken, trigger's clickin
Blow off his head but his feet still kickin
Last as long as you can my man
Cuz when that chicken head hits the fan you got
Blood guts fingers and toes (3x)
Sittin front row at the chicken show so...

[Chorus (3x)]

[Violent J]
Went to Kentucky, I got lucky
Met this hot-collared bitch named Bucky
Riding on a chicken, milking a cow
Hittin switches in a drop top low ride tractor plow

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Redneck fella, moonshine sella
Hang him by his neckbones, chicken bones
Locked in the cellar, yellow belly chicken plucker
You redneck fucker!

[Chorus (3x)]</pre>
