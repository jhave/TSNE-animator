Hook:
I had to say goodbye to Miss January
She had a hold on my mind for so long and
I learned a lesson in life from Miss January
The weight left on my heart is less heavy 
When the first light shines, the first light shines in June

[Talib Kweli]
I thought I fell in love once with a girl who loves blunts
And got fronts and she made me rise above lust
I thought I fell in love again with this one chick
Body so thick it was hard not to....
I fell in love just one more time after that
Shorty had me ready to settle down and make a habitat
The sad fact is I wasn't ready too
Give up my freedom
And so I let them go pretending that I don't need em
So here I sit at the bar amongst the star gazers
Caught in the crosshairs a target of the heart breaker
The radio was playing Neither One of Us
By Gladys, it's so ironic I chuckled ....
I reminisce on all the chicks that I ran thru
Now I'm dealing with this black magic one, man who
Stringing me along like the guitar that I'm rapping on
I ain't do the math, a Libra and a Capricorn

Hook: [Stro and Rez]

[J. Medeiros]
True love got the power to change any circumstance
I knew we were far from the same, but still I took a chance
Wish I could have look in advance to your advances
Knowing I'm the book that you read to your advantage
I understand it's not like we planned it with the worst intentions
Taken advantage, I was stranded in your first impressions
I know it hurts to question, what will be a curse or blessin'
I guess it's worth confessin', maybe then we'll learn our lesson
Searching for your attention, hoping you were doing the same
Pursuing the fame, knowing that only you were entertained
Using me, and I was new to the pain
Cause rejection I hadn't meet him, but I knew him by name
True I grew from the pain, in the days where I'd pay anything
Standing there like John Cusack from Say Anything 
Planning on you to call back but it never rings
There were so many things, there were so many signs
And now I'm chasing wings knowing it's a waste of time
Untill my God reminds me of what I truly need 
I take a look behind just before your beauty leaves
To get a glimpse of you hoping that you see me too
And know we staring at two people that we never knew
And probably never know, hoping I'll forever grow 
Into the one who finally gained the strength to let you go
You changed my ides of what true love is
I wipe my eyes clear and rise above this
