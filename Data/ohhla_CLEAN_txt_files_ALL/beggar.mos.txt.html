[Mos Def]
Woman you know I love you
Woman you know just how I feel
You try to tell me that you don't know
When I know you know the deal

Woman you know I love you
Woman you know I care... 
hey
You try to say
I'm running game
You try to say baby you don't play fair
Oh darling

If there is any doubt in your mind
I want you to be sure... 
heeeey
If you don't ever see me again
I want you to be sure
That I love you
Oh girl
Oh baby I love you
Darling I love you... 
hey
Oh darling I love you... 
hey
(Turn the lights down low)
(Turn the lights down low)

Oh baby
You got to understand how I feel
You need to understand where I'm coming from
Aint no need to be afraid
Aint no need to get up and run
Oh darling
Oh girl you know I love you
Oh darling
You know I know I love you
Oh baby

If you never see me again
I need you to be sure
From this moment right now
Till for ever more
Said I love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love
you, love you, love you, love you... 
babyyyy

Woman I love you
Woman I love you
Woman I love you
AAAAAAHHHHHH... 

Woman I love you</pre>
