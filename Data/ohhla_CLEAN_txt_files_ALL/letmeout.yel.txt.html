Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hey, somebody come let me out
Oh, somebody come let me out [x2]

How ya feeling Billy?
Catfish Billy's feeling good!
And I'm looking around this club like
Man I wish a motherfucker would!

Hey, somebody come let me out
Oh, somebody come let me out

Let's go, 1, 2, 3, 4, hey!
Motherfucker I walk with a crowd!
People yelling
Hey, somebody come let me out
(Yeah, tell 'em)
Oh, somebody come let me out
And I was sitting in the back, drunk in the parking lot
Drinking Jack while I'm thinkin' to the clouds!

Drinking Jack, holding pills
Fuck with my, motor skills
Can't drive, hold the wheel
Hey, somebody come let me out
Call me gay? Can't talk
Homie ya, can't walk
Marijuana, fuck y'all
Hey somebody come let me out
Ain't it beef? Meat racks
Kill em all, big macs
Shady bitch, quick raps

Tell your mama don't worry about ya
She'll be a couple of minutes
She's good to walk around the club with Yelawolf
Hey, somebody come let me out
(Just a little while mama)
Oh, somebody come let me out (hahaha)
Hey, somebody come let me out
Oh, somebody come let me out

Let's go, 1, 2, 3, 4, hey!
Motherfucker I walk with a crowd
People yelling
Hey, somebody come let me out
(Yeah, tell 'em)
Oh, somebody come let me out

And I was sitting in the back, drunk in the parking lot
Drinking Jack while I'm thinkin' to the clouds!

Alabama, neighborhood
Load it up, wish you would
Big body, grippin' wood
Hey, somebody come let me out
Cadilacs, Chevrolets
Famous, family
Country fresh, all day
Hey, somebody come let me out!

Cocaine, Eric Clapton
Rock n roll, what's happenin'?
These nuts, fuck rappin'!
I ain't vaine, I'm just sayin'
I'm saying something about a motherfucker
Who has been a value to something that I like
You can suck a dick, a lot
Whole bunch, whole bunch of them motherfuckers
Heart of Dixie
Dj Frank White, M16 let's go!
1, 2, 3, 4 hey!

Motherfucker I walk with a crowd
People yelling
Hey, somebody come let me out
(Yeah, tell 'em)
Oh, somebody come let me out

And I was sittin' in the back, drunk in the parking lot
Drinking Jack while I'm thinkin' to the clouds! [x2]

Hey, somebody come let me out
Oh, somebody come let me out</pre>
