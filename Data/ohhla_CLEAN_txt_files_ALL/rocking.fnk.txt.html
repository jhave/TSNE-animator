Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move

That's how it goes symbiose, for those who are down
Nuff respect to the pioneers who brought us the sound
We still keep rocking on and on to the break of day
Stay feeling good like you know you should, let me hear you say
We came to rock the party, so come on everybody
Pull up to the bumper baby
Groove with the bumps that make you crazy
This is how we do the do, rocking just to make you move
So pull up to the bumper baby
Groove with the bumps that make you crazy

Fanatic, we're mad it, cause to have it, that B-Boy style
Tremendous, eventious, you'll see us, on a mission worldwide
Fanatic, we're mad it, cause to have it, that B-Boy style
Tremendous, eventious, you'll see us, on a mission worldwide

Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking, rocking, rocking, rocking
Rocking, rocking, rocking, rocking

Crowd of people jamming the jam, ready to get the loose
Sound selector behidn the set, hit the turbo boost
We want the action, satisfaction, reach to the max
With funky breaks, boogie own grooves, dudes with Kangol hats
We came to rock the party, so come on everybody
Pull up to the bumper baby
Groove with the bumps that make you crazy
This is how we do the do, rocking just to make you move
So pull up to the bumper baby
Groove with the bumps that make you crazy

Fanatic, we're mad it, cause to have it, that B-Boy style
Tremendous, eventious, you'll see us, on a mission worldwide
Fanatic, we're mad it, cause to have it, that B-Boy style
Tremendous, eventious, you'll see us, on a mission worldwide

Make you move, make you move
Make you move, make you move
Make you move, make you move
Make you move, make you move

Rocking, rocking, rocking, rocking
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move
Rocking just to make you move

Make you move, make you move
Make you move, make you move
Make you move, make you move
Make you move, make you move</pre>
