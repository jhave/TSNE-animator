{"Nam Myoho Renge Kyo" - repeat 8X}

[Chorus One: Xzibit over 4X of "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"]
Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate, concentrate
Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate, concentrate

{"Nam Myoho Renge Kyo" continues to repeat in the background}

[Xzibit]
Meditate, levitate
Greetings from the Golden State
Mr. X, to the Z
Concentrate, come walk with me
Your shit sound so awkwardly
I don't rhyme I just stomp down beats
Real estate, section eight
Which one would you rather take?
Concentrate, move that weight
Show me how you regulate
Hold up, wait, that shit's fake
Get these niggaz up out my face
Shake the room, bend the spoon
Turn this up now, stay in tune
Hypnotized by the way she move
Take your time you might arrive too soon, hahahaha

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two: Xzibit over 4X of "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"]
Bring that back, what was that?
Oh my lord, she got back
So precise, so intact
Oh my God, who is that?

[San Quinn]
Look what I freak up, G's up, he's up
He's rough, all in my court never freeze up
They release us streets-less
Increase the rush of Californians speakin up
It won't be absent-minded
Still chasin money that I practice findin
Boy you know that Rick Rock beats is violent
You never been dumb, it don't hurt to try it
I'm the flyest gangsta, and I can do it
Better concentrate on the Hyphy Movement
X to the Z and the Quinn is live
Get some money out a ho so I can +Pimp My Ride+
Better take two, elevate and we're concentratin on booty shakin
and who you takin back for the bang (back for the bang)
I have a drink and pop my thizzle (pop my thizzle)
While you stop and drop and work your wiggle

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Xzibit]
Breath control, touch yo' soul
Just maintain don't lose control
Participate, congratulate
Cause everything else'll be seen as hate
Remain in place, the same mindstate
Get off yo' ass and celebrate
Congregate, associate
Don't fuck yo'self procrastinate
Dilate, to an all time great
Calculate the next move I make
Crack the safe, keep that ace
in my waistband just in case
I'm no rat can't run yo' race
Not too good don't fit my taste
I love the way she make that shake
Makin it hard to concentrate

[Chorus Two] + [Chorus One]

[28 seconds of instrumental]
