"Think what you wanna, I keep one in the chamber" --&gt; SCC's Servin' Em Heat

[BRONCOE]
Break it down or switch your blow, that's how we run this shit
Light it up, take a hit - and give it up your click
You know for sure I'm smokin' doja
My folks I thought I told ya
Twist my sack and give me over throw the Tec and ride with locsters
HAT GANG and ?? TOWN hoo-ridin' in HOLMES STREET
FRANKLIN SQUARE, FUSHED TOWN, NEW HOLMES and FRONT STREET
AVENUE, BLUE GATE, BEACH TOWN, '7TH STREET
10-LINE, 11-DUECE, BABY LOCS and GRAPE STREET
99 MAFIA, P.J. WATTS
You get your props if you can ride, if you'se a Slob you get mobbed
It's alright ??? cause it like props on my block
I run with locs that aint't broke which y'all get smoked and ?throw lot?
I got 16 shots with extraclips in my side
If you'se a trick you get the ducksicc cause I'm cool in your cock
Shake the spot, fade your black, you back you trip and I'm sayin'
You claim my style 'cause you too wild this ain't the time to parlay

[BRONCOE]
I'm servin' sess in the daytime, chronic at night
I'm dumpin' rounds around the car for all you folks on the block
I gotta sess in the daytime, chronic at night
All my job servin' Slobs and blast that ass all night

[BRONCOE]
You can find me on the East/Side, rip ridin' with the locsters
Swervin' five deep with the heat hittin' corners
Dippin' on dubs and Golds on Thunderbirds and doja
My colors flag my rag and sack my khakis like a soldier
Stay suckers free, you only see me with my - G's
I'm chokin' off the smoke with loc Big Freeze
What's up young Cuzz? Where you from? The Town
Where's at? On the East/Side, 10-5 by the Jordan Downs
Twist to my camp, come to my hood and
I guarantee that the loc'll gun you down when you stand
Off brand, other side better realize
Ain't no surprise out of the East Side Rip Ridaz causin' homicide
This is how we do it, check me out you don't hear me
It's do or die from day one, Compton and Watts can you feel?
My dick hard ??? down in the sperm
You grab your baby ?? and blast them bustas up outta there

[BRONCOE]
Servin' sess in the daytime, chronic at night
You dump rocks around the car for all the folks on the block
Sex in the daytime, chronic at night
All my job servin' Slobs and blast that ass on sight

[BRONCOE]
Always ready for the rumble, never stutter, never stumble
Wet him up, shut him up and watch his whole cookie crumble cuz
You loc ?? on the West Coast
?? low the YGB case in the raincoat
Fifty on your back ?? but flow is tragic
But who do the doo-doo with that all black magic
Grab the paper tell my loc
Murder folks with the do'
Double back up on my khakis, ready to strap you like I'm suppose to
The locster
I told ya, straight up out the Watts
From twenty-one-hundred, East Hun' and '7 Street block
Real niggas gimme that cause I freak a fuckin' track
I meet my brother from the Town it's goin' down and I stay strapped
And just all you know, that you fuckin' with the loc
Twist down 10-5 and that's for Young Broncoe
