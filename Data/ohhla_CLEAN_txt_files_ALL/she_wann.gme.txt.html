[Game - Verse 1]
Everybody fucking Amber Rose
Is the pussy good? Only Kanye/Cameron knows
And who this Tami hoe telling me and Trey shooting a video
In a month and she can get a cameo
SMH TTM five star we be them
LOL hide my bbm ain't got my bbm
Lou Vuiton he be in 'tron got em queasy and
My Money ain't Young that's my nigga Lil' Weezy and 'em
I keep one rolled like Wiz Khalifa and 'em
Got some college hoes what wanna smoke a swisha sweet with him
They ain't no Lauren Londons but they got that Megan Good
They use that Photoshop to get their ass up out the hood
And its all good with us niggaz mayne
I said its all good cause I'm a trigga man
Yeah she said she wanna have Jayceon kid
I told that bitch you better off with Jason kid

[Chorus - Trey Songz]
I do it cause they love it
If you hate it bitch who give a fuck I made it
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhhh)
Plus I do it for the ladies
Somebody say they wanna have my baby
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhhh)
She said she wanna have my baby
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)
Who tryna have my baby
She said she wanna have my baby
She said she tryna have my baby

[Game - Verse 2]
How many bitches in the club just to fuck a platinum rapper
Poking microscopic holes into the Magnum rappers
Hoping on the dick but I ain't throwing carrots at ya
You ain't gon' Worldstar me I ain't your average rapper
You drinking all the Goose then bitch I ain't finna pay
You don't look like your Twitter avatar anyway
Bitch you look like an Avatar anyway
And that's the same bitch that was stalking Fab' ain't it Trey? (Yup)
And this is how I know you're giving free head
If you was getting paid, the bottom of your shoe would be red
But it ain't, she claiming she a saint
But as soon she see Dwight she go hard in the paint
But her girlfriend the type you wanna take home
Throw a little Drake on it really shouldn't take long
Then she told me that she wanna meet Trey Songz
I told that bitch strip and start singing all Trey song's

[Chorus]

[Chorus - Trey Songz]
I do it cause they love it
If you hate it bitch who give a fuck I made it
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhhh)
Plus I do it for the ladies
Somebody say they wanna have my baby
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhhh)
She said she wanna have my baby
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)
Who tryna have my baby
She said she wanna have my baby
She said she tryna have my baby</pre>
