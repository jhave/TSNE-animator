[Big Ed]  (Da Diiiiiiiick)

I'm having a big problem, or should I say difficulty?
With my body's faculty
My wood ain't acting right, as soon as I got this girl to act right 
Seduced her to give up the ass on the first night
Her name is Cynthia, hell of a body that will send for ya
Backstage, D.C, had my niggas go send for her
She spotted me and she said 
"I was just wondering why they call you Big Ed?"
Now that's the million dollar question hon'
Let just say in the sack I'm known to make a run
Forget about it, cause I'll hit you with that pressure
Can't wait to undress ya, with your fine ass lookin' like Vanessa
5'11", light skin, green eyes and convacios
Defintely lickable in delicate places
Not tonight though, strickly just to dick down 
Got to the telly, honey laid down, pulled the pannies way down
Ain't got time to waste now, she's tuggin' at my waist now
Dropped my pants, dropped my drawers, and whipped it out
Inserted into her mouth, she wrapped her head around the ear
She let me watch my dick disappear, reappear
I rubbed the cat, finger fucked it, she grabbed my hand and sucked it
And in the other hand nothing but dick
I got my jim-hand but when I tried to put it on 
My hard-on was gone 
I told my dick "Attention salute"
But he didn't, insuborate motherucker
What happened to the rocka rocka motherfucker?
Then he spoked, spoked me I almost choked
On my spit, this is ricdoulous
I'm looking at my piece like whose dick is this?
(Who Am I? I'm the nigga that made you
I'm the reason why all the honies laid you
I got 'em doing all that freaky shit they do
Reprations overdue)
Nigga hold up, reprations? (Yeah I said it)
Now what you mean you got me pussy? (Oh I didn't get it?)
(Only thing you did was brag about me
Telling 'em how I'm hangin' like Nights of the Boogie
All in the your raps, all in your convo
you building curosity straight from the get-go
You know, and I know, that she wants to know
And she ain't gonna go, until she knows how long I grow)
Nigga I got it from the game I spit 
I enticed the mind way before she saw the dick
What you mean you made me? I'm the that bust the raps
Bust the gats (Yeah but I got the nuts to go do that
Hoes I run through that) 
Fool when I walk in the spot they be like who that?
(Nigga they be lookin' at the bulge in your pants
The size of your feet and hands, peepin' out your stance
Musclar, six pack, don't mean shit
They leave your stupid ass if you go impatent
Nigga you ain't shit without me, can't do shit without me
Cause every women loves a big fat stiffy
That she can sit on, direct and cream on
And if I don't rise up, best believe she's gone
Alot of women want their cats licked
But it takes a backseat to some bomb dick
Even money won't do the trick, she'll get tired of the shit
She'll start sneaking around hunting for some dick
The want from you to lift shit, fix shit 
You wouldn't be around if you weren't attached to dick
I'm in control, I'm the brain's extension
No matter you postition, just look at Bill Clinton
Dykes hate you but buy me off the shelf)
Man nigga fuck you (Nawl that's bad for your health
And while we on the topic, this bad hoe you wanna stab
Can't fuck with her dogg, she got crabs
And they'll get in my afro, oh hell no
Let's just bust from flacio, cause she'll go)
