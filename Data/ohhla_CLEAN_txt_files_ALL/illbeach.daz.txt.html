[Daz Dillinger]
With a deuce-deuce revolver, the game is a motherfucker
Time will tell if we all just go to Hell
Another sucka bite the dust, did so well
It's like I'm huntin' for whales, huntin' for mil
I lust for a light sex, that's what I need
And you know I stay heated nigga so what's up next?
It's flamable, that's when you're burnt
Get turned and spit up and down for nigga for what it's worth
So what you want?... motherfuckers 'round here get stomped
You can't tell me shit, your words are lies, I despise
You'll hear the battle cry, that's when it's all over, when you die
You're outta here - finished
You been a busta since I knew you
Until then and now I never knew you
Diggy run right through, take it for what it's worth
Get hurt, skirt out from all this dirt
Ripped his shirt with a 12-gauge shotty
You better stay alert cause I'ma hurt somebody
I caught him in my scope, so you know I yell "Gotti!"
And Dat Nigga Daz ain't scared of nobody
I lay down the rules and I lay down the law
The rawest you ever seen and the rawest you saw
So draw down and whip it out
I'll flip you up and then I'll flip you out
Get you outta the picture nigga when I empty out
Prepare for the trash, he just trash
I gotta be Dat Nigga cause that's just Daz
Nigga, so fuck yo' rhymes, and fuck yo' beats
And fuck y'all niggaz with no love for me
You're just a coward, a pussy, a bitch ass wussy
You push me to the limit and this is just what it does to me
I'm more than badder than ever, I'll throw these things in any weather
You whoopin' Dat Nigga Daz? - whatever!

[Soopafly talking]
Hey Daz, I told you this nigga was a bitch
Man fuck this nigga, let's get him cuh
(You know what motherfuckers - )

[Chorus]
I'll Beacho Azz, stomp you out
Get inside your grill, cold knock you out
You bitch ass niggaz what I'm talkin' about
Cause I'll Beacho Azz (nigga), stomp you out
Get inside your grill, cold knock you out
You bitch ass niggaz what I'm talkin' about
Cause I'll Beacho Azz, and stomp you out

We the real Dogg Pound around here
We don't hang with sucka niggaz who squares
Punk faggots beware
We the real Dogg Pound around here
We don't hang with sucka niggaz who squares
Punk faggots beware

[Daz Dillinger]
I hit him with the force of vengeance
And every sentence, every fuckin' line that I've written
(Who's that? - Dat Nigga Daz)
Come through like I do, on a hunt to pursue you, just to slang a few
Countless nights, me and my niggaz ridin' striped
But them niggaz that rap for death, cover your life
The ground that you walked on
The conversations you talked on
The same block you grew up on you're gettin' chalked on
Yellow tape, there's no escape (nigga)
I pray to Lord that your soul I take
If you should die before I wake
(Yet and still nigga you'll never see another day)
I keep dumpin' when them nines keep dumpin'
Me and my niggaz rumpin' when that bass start bumpin'
Like N.W.A. I'm always into somethin'
And y'all motherfuckers out here ain't nothin'
Cause I'll -

[Chorus]
Beacho Azz, stomp you out
Get inside your grill, cold knock you out
You bitch ass niggaz know what I'm talkin' about
Cause I'll Beacho Azz (nigga), stomp you out
Get inside your grill, cold knock you out
You bitch ass niggaz what I'm talkin' about
Cause I'll Beacho Azz, stomp you out (traitor)

We the real Dogg Pound around here
We don't hang with sucka niggaz who squares
Punk faggots beware
We the real Dogg Pound around here
We don't hang with sucka niggaz who squares
Punk faggots beware

[Outro: Daz Dillinger]
And you nigga is a motherfuckin' queer
And I'll beat y'all motherfuckin' asses
I ain't got to rap a motherfuckin' lick nigga
You know what time it is nigga
You know about Dat Nigga Daz nigga
You know I'll beat yo' motherfuckin' ass
You and that big fat head motherfucker in the background
Queer..
