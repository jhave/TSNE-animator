Song:   Middle of You
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
There's nothing like my insulated walls around you
It's so wrong?
Don't you want to celebrate it
You can find me, somewhere in the middle of you
Somewhere in the middle of you
When I'm looking for the truth
I find it in the middle of you

[Wiz Khalifa]
You know I keep that weed lit
Met her once, you let me hit
You asking for the remix, calling me cause this ain't what you want
She say, she need this, G-shit
Rolling Papers, told the neighbours
I be tryna keep you quiet, once we grown we sure to wake em
Roll this weed, before you leave, be sure to bake one
Got a man, but when he gone the boy replace him
Smokin' OG kush, that's Californication
On the phone you fusssin', while we fornicating

[Chorus]
Well, I'ma let you roll one
Let you light it nice
Car, let you drive it
Let you have the time of your life
Go on get excited
Got all your friends invited
My jewelry the brightest
Loud weed, I'm smoking Leonidas
On my team, only cause we the tightest
Shopping spree's, shit I should be your stylist
Them niggas try to be with you
When you with me I pound it
Get you so high you gon' need a pilot

[Chorus]

You roll one, I roll one too
You find me
Me in the middle of you
You roll one, I'll roll one too
No where I'd rather be
Then the middle of you

[Chevy Woods]
Bottle after bottle,
Got you ready for the World to see it
All 3am in the morning, I'm the one you call
Got the car keys, pedal to the floor, I'm on the way flow
I ain't on no kid shit but I stay with some play dough
Keep it Taylored, everyday she noticed that
Roll it up, light with my homies, sit and hold it in
That's the fact you chillin' too much
You need excitement
Now you sky high on some first flight shit

[Chorus]
There's nothing like my insulated walls around you
It's so wrong?
Don't you want to celebrate it
You can find me, somewhere in the middle of you
Somewhere in the middle of you
When I'm looking for the truth
I find it in the middle of you</pre>
