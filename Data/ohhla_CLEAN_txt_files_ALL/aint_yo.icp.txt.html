[Intro]
Rude Boy sittin pancaked on 23s
Clown love to Chicage Juggalos
We underground like Blaze (My Dead Homie)
And yours
We dead, we dead, no wait a minute......we don't die
We don't die. We Dead

(Violent J)
Maybe I like bloody, murder music
You know shit like "Stab Your Fuckin Eye"
Maybe I like eatin shit like Tylenol P.M.s
Cuz 5 or 6'll get you high
Maybe I like punchin people I don't even know
I knock 'em flat up fuckin out (PAHH!)
Tuck some money in they jacked with a note that simply reads
"I had to let some anger out" (Sorry)
Maybe I only hang with weirdos, and hoodlums, and junkies
I keep 'em by my side
Maybe mama doesn't understand a friend is hard to comeby
SO I keep what I find
Maybe I got 2 felonies, tattoos on my neck
And I always pain't my face
Can I still date your daughter I mean I think I outta
I like the way she taste

(Chorus) 2x
Ain't YO Bidness, how I act
Ain't yo bidness, don't get slapped
Ain't yo concern, what we do
Less you want yo, face slapped too

(Violent J)
Maybe I don't' even like you but I gotta front
Cuz your a record label guy (Mother fucker)
What if I dragged you by the hair into the street
And beat your ass, put a boot up in your eye (PUH! BItch)
Maybe I would rather fuck a Missy Elliot
Before a Toni... "Braxton"
Maybe I would rather fuck a Macy Grey
Before a Janet... "Jackson"
Maybe I don't' have no self esteem
SO I like to pick on everybody else
Maybe when I was a boy, underneath my shirt
I had bruises and welts "Oh" (It's OK)
Maybe I was hungry, bottom barrel poor
And my mom was always sick
Maybe I'm lyin, I'm just tryna find and excuse to be a dick
I'm a dick-dick
Maybe i'm upset that you left me
I'll hang myself right above your bed (YOu Should Try Suicide)
From the ceiling fan, so i'll be swingin when you walk
I, I might kick you in the head
Maybe I got 7 therapists, I been committed
But my manager got me free (Double A Y'all)
18 Pills a day, I get so dizzy and high
Sometimes I can't even see (I gotta sit down)

(Chorus)
