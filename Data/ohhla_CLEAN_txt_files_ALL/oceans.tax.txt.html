"To discover or not to discover, that is the question
Whether it is nobler in the mind to nurture growth or to ignore change
And by opposing, end evolution
To mal-educate, to uncommunicate no more
And by an uncommunicativeness to say..."

[Verse 1]
You know it's truthful when you hear me
Real name J Christie, born '73
Deep down I'm probably just like you
Deep down you're probably just like me
My ambition's to be free
My favourite colour's green like the land
Second favourite's blue like the sea
and the sky I see most
I have a vision of me sitting happy on the coast
The blue water crashes down, the ocean sound
By a lighthouse; image that I felt in a book
My children play together on the sand,
I look, can't see their faces yet
I love her deeply even though we haven't yet met
My future's far from set
At times I forget to live for here and now
I'm in a dream-world, cliff-top, my private sundown
And if the wind comes and tries to blow me off the ledge
I'll be falling still clutching my dreams until I'm dead
And how I feel today, tomorrow won't apply
Landed in a rock pool, survived cos I refuse to die
Now, what this Braintax thing is really all about is:
Utilising your brain can give you more clout
My mind keeps me positive when the world gets me down
I close my eyes and orange dots melt my stony frown
I stay looking ahead like a figurehead
My ship drifts, bouncing my physical while my mind lifts
It's all about a vivid life, more colour, it's a new day,
Snap your skull, chase the blues away
We splash lime, scales climb and diminish
Creating every image off the top of me
And time's never stopping me
Therapist tried hard to be a hedonist but only Earth's rockin' me
These drugs are good though they're blocking me
They're nice when they're free
And help ease the pain when it feels life's knockin' me
I'll get the roof terrace and the olive grove,
The swimming pool, home in the sun
Somewhere on the globe there's a place
So I'ma ship in the night
Weighing anchor in the place where my soul feels right
