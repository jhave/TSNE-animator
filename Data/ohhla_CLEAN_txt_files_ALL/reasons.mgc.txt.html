Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Their are many reasons, I'm in love with you
Make me feel so special, everything that you do
How you hold me tight, every day and night
And then you give me love girl, I just know your all mine
Cause you always show me, I'm worth more than gold
Cause your my forever, never wanna let you go
And with your kiss I feel, that our love is real
I'm feeling blessed my heaven, cuz I know your right here
These are the reasons why I love you

[MC Magic]
Has anybody ever came into your life and changed your world
More than a beautiful face, a special girl
Someone who really understands your soul
Even if we separated, I never let you go
I spend the rest of my days and nights
Living for the moment you came back into my life
Cause I can name a million reasons that I can't let you go
And the first one, is cuz your so beautiful
Oh girl, I just wanna let you no
That their is no one, in this whole wide world
And the moment that I die
I know that you will be, the last thing on my mind
So every time that you close your eyes
Remember that I'm always on your side
The only girl that ever gave me like a million reasons why

[Chorus]
Their are many reasons, I'm in love with you
Make me feel so special, everything that you do
How you hold me tight, every day and night
And then you give me love girl, I just know your all mine
Cause you always show me, I'm worth more than gold
Cause your my forever, never wanna let you go
And with your kiss I feel, that our love is real
I'm feeling blessed my heaven, cuz I know your right here
These are the reasons why I love you

[Ms. Krazie]
My crazy baby, damn let me count the ways
That you make me fall in love with you every single day
Don't hesitate to wanna stay I'm never leaving you
Porque theirs so many rasones why you keep me holding on to you
That's why I'm nervous, everytime you call me
The sound of your voice when you tell me that you love me
It's just so hard to say, so I'd rather show you
It's just so hard to explain what I feel for you
I just want to let you know
I love everything you done for me, I appreciate it
And I just want to let you know
Wanna spend my life with you, be your one and only lady
Toda la rasones por las cuales yo te queiro
Y varias otras cosas por que sin ti, yo me muero
No te vallas de me vida, baby quedate con migo
Ahora y por vida

[Chorus]
Their are many reasons, I'm in love with you
Make me feel so special, everything that you do
How you hold me tight, every day and night
And then you give me love girl, I just know your all mine
Cause you always show me, I'm worth more than gold
Cause your my forever, never wanna let you go
And if you kiss I feel, that our love is real
I'm feeling blessed my heaven, cuz I know your right here
These are the reasons why I love you</pre>
