[E]
Uh, and you dont stop yeah yeah
Uh Huh yeah yeah ha ha

[Slick Rick]
You know what I'm sayin so I said
(rick D)

Uh huh, yeah
Big Brown uh huh, yeah

You ready?

[Erick Sermon]
Yo, in the Y2K, my chips be micro, unlimited
Me and Rick D reap the benefit
Cars, girls, jewels, innocent 
Next year it'll be old, we get rid of it
Yeah like that, yeah we knock 'em out the box yo
Money's deep like the gold at fort Knox yo
Rhyme killer, kill an iller rhyme with no effort
At you trick a hole your crew (blao!)
You're mad now huh? You can't stand me
Now watch when I'm recieving a grammy
A Soul Train when I'm getting a Sammy
Davis Junior award, fans applaud
For me, Erick Onasis, top dog
The money folder, I'm like Don King's promoter
Ya'll can't see me I'm ariborne type tuskeegee
Wicked like the board of Ouija 
When I step in the door things change
Everything stops like ya freeze frame
It's mad hot now, Gettin ready to boil
(Rick the Ruler!) Me, the MC Grand Royal

Chorus:
[Erick Sermon]
ER, Ravishing
I, impress
C, courageous or careless
K, for the Kani's that I got
That I rock everyday, and why, why not?
[Slick Rick]
R is ravishing
I, impress
C, courageous or careless
K, for the Kangol's which I've got
What I wear everyday, and why, why not?

[Slick Rick]
Emotion and hope in the scope 
When the paw print on the button on my brand new garage door opener
"Ungh", as the double R rips through the gutter
Even 7 Day Advents scream "that shit's butter!"
You best remember who's the skipper
Remember who made girl's joint drop so hard it popped the zipper 
Illusion on no boozin confusion
Even ghosts like "Ruler I'm scared of you son"
As I lean and dip, dream might seem a bit odd
Lights just turned red turn green for Rick (ya know)
On the deacon, with my stuff in there blastin
Till the signs on the highway start to wop when I pass them (ohhh)
Mad bougeoui folk bent, perhaps offend
Chrome almost made another Rolls have an accident
The Ruler wildin, La Di Da Di Don is stylin
On his way to see green eyed buddy on the Island

(Chorus)</pre>
