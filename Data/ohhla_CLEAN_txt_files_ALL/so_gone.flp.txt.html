[Hook: Big Shasta]
Now we can roll some berry blunts
Supersize two feet long
And when it's done stuff the bong
So we can smoke on
You know we got the sticky trees
That's why we make smoke songs
One thing I know for sure
Is that I'm so gone

[C-Bo]
Yeh M-J baby you mean everything to me
I built all my raps and goals, and life around you
I don't care what they think, I ain't right without you
I don't dip whip shit, through the night without you
Swisha, ciguerilla, cause you just so potent
Put the towel under the do', cause you just so open
I can see me wid you all in my life
I'm in my drop top rollin' down Sunset all through the night
Cause when I, fire ya up right, they know you're the truth
I just look at them other niggaz, cause they want a hit too
But I ain't into sharin' mines, less you one of my dogs
If you wid us it ain't shit we blow one of my logs
I keep the dro loose, like it's supposed to
So when they hit it they just choke like they supposed to
You wanna blow to?, you gon' need dough fool
You hit my blunt I snatch it back like I don't know you

[Lil' Flip]
Imagine ridin' down the highway eyes all blurry
Cops pull me over cause they know I'm in a hurry
I ain't worried I ain't ridin' dirty but I'm high as fuck
I hoppin' out like damn, you wanna buy my truck?
It must've been my luck, for me to get stopped
It must've been your luck, for you to get dropped
I roll the creme of the crop, the best shit nigga
We ain't fuckin' around wid that stress shit nigga
I went to Amsterdam, in a tannish Lan
I ain't wear my fuckin' jewelry they know who I am
I Lil' Flipper, the nigga who was leanin' to the left
Just, freestylin' eversince Jazzy Jeff, and the Fresh Prince
Well I'm the fresh king, you wearing little stones
I got begets in my ring, I got green weed purple weed
No more commercial weed,  hah ha
That's how I do it smoke one G

[Hook]
