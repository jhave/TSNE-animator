1 - 	All day, all day, every day
	All day, all day, every day
	All day, all day, every day
	All day, all day, every day
	This is how we do every day, all day

Repeat 1 three times

Don't get it twisted
Make no mistake
I keep it real
With every jam I make

Tempo's down 
Bumpin' hip-hop beats
They feel me most
Out here on the streets

And I don't care
If you think I'm loud
I'm sensitive 
When my man's around 

My clothes stay baggy
That might be so
Dress like my brotha
But I'm sexy y'all

2 - 	With my style flow
	And Baggy clothes
	Loose style is how we go
	Every day and all day
	This way is how we stay

	Don't care what they say
	I stay right anyway
	Every day and all day

This is how we do every day, all day

Don't try to play me
I'm not the one
Might be a shorty
But I'm having none

Alot of people
They think they know
How I gets down
And how I flow

And I don't care
About Versace wear
Channel, Moschino
That shit is outta here

I got a dirty mouth
That might be true
No disrespect
But fuck you

Repeat 2
Repeat 1
Repeat 1	
Repeat 2
Repeat 2

This is how we do every day all day
Like this and like that

Repeat until fade</pre>
