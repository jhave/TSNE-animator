[Scarface sample]
I told you, don't fuck with me
Stupid fuck, look at you now
 
Yeah, ha ha, have you noticed like
When niggas go to the club, it's always
It's one knucklehead nigga always mean mugging and shit
Heh, he wanna, he wanna have contact with me
Have contact with men, all these bitches in here
Faggot ass, these for them hard head niggas man
 
[1st verse]
Now I don't wanna come across as a boss some type of mafia
But these are my thoughts, they awful, I won't argue with ya
But see, I got a cause a clause, that I live by
Keep the heater close because I don't want to die
You see I'm from Detroit where they dump 'em off in coffins
And often there's assorted men where bullets holes departed him
And I don't want no parts of them, crazy complications
So I keep the heater cocked up in case of confrontation
And I would just be fakin if I said I wouldn't erase him
If he blatantly, tried to take away God's creation
 
[Chorus]
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Running up on me, may he, rest in peace once released
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Yeah, look at ya now, for running ya mouth, ya stretched on the ground
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Ain't no way you can stop it, on that hot shit, we can get it popping
I'll kill me a muthafucka
{I told you, don't fuck with me, stupid fuck, running ya mouth}
 
[2nd verse]
Now I'm riding through the city in a Range with no tints
Just to show these muthafuckas yes I am a resident
I ain't stack up my pennies just to move out the city
So if you got a problem with me you should know where to get me
Niggas kills me, portraying that thug
My nigga, you's a crack baby, go smoke on some drugs
Before that hot piece of slug make you where you ain't budging
Don't even nudge him, it's over for cousin, he caught a dozen
Just for fucking with the wrong animal
Animated no more, off to hell, yes I
 
[Chorus]
 
[3rd verse]
When I'm down in ATL
Stat Quo keep my fo'fo'
So shawty know Obie for real
When I'm chilling in L.A.
Dre keep my AK, so I'm like an esse
When banging that steel
When I'm out in NYC
50 hold artillery for me
Watch me shut down son and dunny
Listen, O-bizzle, hold the Tek-nizzle
Holding ya neck if you, disrespect Bizzle
Sizzle up tissue, missles will not miss you
Maybe ya momma, when that pistol uplifts you
 
[Chorus]</pre>
