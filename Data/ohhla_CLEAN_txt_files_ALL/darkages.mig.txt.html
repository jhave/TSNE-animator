[Intro] [MURS talking]
I don't know where-where the sixteen is

[MURS]
Huh, here we come 
It's the California kid
A rugged raw rhyme spitter
Certified real nigga
Coolin' in Cali like Muggs in a blizzard
You, yesterday's news like Tommy Hillfiger
On the cover of Rap Pages
Rap is so primitive, we back to the black ages
Should I say it's dark?
Invaded by these marks
Busters and herbs
Gettin' just what they deserve when I thrust these verbs
It's a way of life when I slay this mic
You couldn't see me like ? whether day or night
Height, is not an issue
I still get with you
5'8 and three quarters of I-ain't-afraid-to-diss-you
Complex, Napoleon Dynamite
Rhymin' like you lookin' at your wrist
Tryin' to find if the time is right
That means checkin' y'all
Now inspect these bars
At the end of the day I want respect that's all

[Karniege]
One get's them warmed up
Two get's it started
Handicap your camp with kids retarded
Ninjas in the party disguised as crash dummies
Walked out, bust out with mo' mo' money
It's time for change like quarters on a clock
My finger's got minutes, I'm callin' the shoots
Big kids make moves
You can get rocked like mountain climbers
Avalanche dancin'
Tumble on the Earth
Survival? No chances
Whatever the season, my thoughts rain there like guerrilla monsoons
Loot of vixin' and Brandson
Spit a witty buck fifty that'll tickle you bastards
Bow and arrows verses rifles I'm both
Either way I'm makin' hits with eyes closed
Silly cats shootin' Billy Blanks, my Tae-Bo
Flows been psycho ever since high school

[Vast Aire]
Vast's flow can turn men to mice
If reality's a whore, I'm fuckin' her twice
And on the third time, she'll be screamin' my name
And her best friend Truth will tell you the same
I'm the same chubby kid with a Bruce Lee poster
That'll finger pop a bitch to check the odor
That's ill, they put coke in soda?
Naw, what's ill is I, practice with Yoda
My people rep the sun cause they're dark
Only in the skin, not in the heart
I'm a Nubian native
Indian archer
That'll do a rain dance for the Cherokee loss
Navajo loss
Apache loss
Shit, even the Hebrew that died on the cross
Remember black was first, so it's beautiful
I ain't 3/5th
I'm the millennium general</pre>
