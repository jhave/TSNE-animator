[Verse One]:

[Xzibit]:
It's a lazy Sunday night
Xzibit posted at the lab
Gettin' high as a kite
Proceed to rolll the light
It's real tight
In a paper Philly Blunts I don't need
It might fuck off the taste
Of this bomb ass weed
My nigga Tango and Breeze
Came thru we blaze a few
Together bored as fuck
Niggas down for whatever
Break left from the bomb
Phone call from Ron Hightower
Shower at his crib in a hour
All the women involved drop drawers
Don't say nothin'
Just a lota nuttin'
Fuckin' plus dick suckin'
Goddamn who was that?
Half black with the fat ass
Too much to ask if you can put them on the glass
[For me]
My name's Xzibit
I aint' tryin' to spit game
Just tell me your name
And the proportions of your frame
[38-26-32]
That's right
Xzibit now has it poppin' on Sunday night

[Chorus]: (2x)
I don't wanna save 'em
Pay em' or buy clothes
All we really wanna do 
Is try to fuck these hoes

[Verse Two]:

[Rass Kass]:
You knew the game
And you still ended up on your back...

[Xzibit]:
Bitches get laid like tracks
Break it down like that
With stacks of profilactics
Got ill tactics just to get you on the matress like yo
  [girl moaning in background]
With minimal conversation
No time wastin'
Only hard penetration
Gettin' shiners on recliners
Cummin' in your faces
Stop! Get on top
I take your mind different places
Won't be satisfied till I hit every race
Color and creed in deed
All I need is weed a fly steez
Who ain't afraid to take the lead
A little dirt on your knees
Looked over saw Breeze
Laid out on the couch about to let it all out
Nigga that's the kinda shit that I'm talkin' about

[Chorus]: (4x)
I don't wanna save em'
Pay em' or buy clothes
All we really wanna do 
Is try to fuck these hoes
