[Verse 1]
I'm just tryin' to build my army up
But these days they shootin' at me with a tommy gun
Carry the weight 'cause I'm strong enough
But sometimes the hate, make me feel like I'm pulling a Tonka truck
What's the fuss? I bought the murda bizness to all of them
They asking questions like I ain't talking about dressing
Are we talking about art, or are we talking about perception?
If it bangs play my record, if not, then shelf it
While others coming up shorter than elf limbs
I realize I may be the realest bitch they ever dealt with
And to be honest these rumours be all fables
See I don't get dropped; I drop the label
Let's keep it very clear, I'm doing just fine
I'm sitting on a million, your bank's flatline
Death to the haters, face it one time
You got your own dick bitch
Why you ridin' mine?

[Chorus]
Kick me down but I'm a champion
Heard them say that I'm not the one
Nevermind them, never-nevermind them
Nevermind them, never-nevermind them
Carry the weight like a champion
Go sell the dreams to the other ones
Nevermind them, never-nevermind them
Nevermind them, never-nevermind them

[Verse 2]
I never learned to fail, all I know is win
The haters shoot me down, can't help but crash land
I get up walking, they still talking it never ends
They build me up to break me down it builds me up again
On my Twin Tower shit, even when I'm gone
They gon' pay to see where I've been
I ain't do this shit alone but it ain't take many friends
Now I understand the song, many men many men
It's only so long, fake bitches can't pretend
I'm gone with the wind, they can't even catch my drift
The hate keep you from hearing, well fuck it read my lips
There's some things I never do: never lose, never quit
Never change who I am, never give a fuck who gives a shit
I'm drunk off life, of course I'm swerving in and shit
I'm in the zone throne empty I'ma take a sit
And like my girl Tiny all these haters on my Tip

[Chorus x3]
Kick me down but I'm a champion
Heard them say they can knock you off
Nevermind them, never nevermind them
Nevermind them, never nevermind them
Carry the weight like a champion
Go sell the dreams to the other ones
Nevermind them, never nevermind them
Nevermind them, never nevermind them</pre>
