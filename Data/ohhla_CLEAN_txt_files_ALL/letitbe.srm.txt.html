I love it when ya bounce bounce bounce, 
shakin the top, shakin the bottom
Can I pounce pounce pounce, 
chasin the boots and then I done got 'em
Can I go go go?  As soon as you thinkin I'm done 
I'm takin it slow, slow, SLOW
The butt-man's back puttin ?mauls on the mud duct?
Stab stab stab, Mitsubishis eat dust
Steppin on the way to a club
They had a big butt contest so I know I got pub[licity]
SMOOTH, STROLL, step into the club
I got MO, DOUGH, some jealous brothers
Got BEEF, THOUGH, got fourteen mamas
On my HIP, SO, don't do it bro!
Five hundred dollars to the skirt wit the most bounce
Mix-a-Lot is judgin so they let it all out
Wet T-shirts, itty bitty skirts
All my homies straight puttin in work (much work)
I call it sexy, some call it sexist
Can't tell a lie, Mr. Richard is restless
Pump pump pump, now they got me on ?skips?
The girly in the purple on the right is on hip
She got a body but she can't dance a ounce
To hell witcha dance moves girl, just let it beaounce

(Shake shake it mama)
<bounce> (Shake shake shake it mama)
Let it beaounce (Shake shake it mama)
<bounce> (Shake shake shake it mama)
Let it beaounce (Shake shake it mama)
<bounce> (Shake shake shake it mama)
Let it beaounce (Shake shake it mama)
<bounce> (Shake shake shake it mama)

So baby in the purple got paid
Now she's sittin in my car so it's time to check the age
Baby girl's age is the same as her waist 
Deuce-four ... my taste!  (mmh)
Thick soul sista wit the dookie braids
Fine young princess flamin wit the self made boss
I paid the cost so I'm the big hoss
When the skirts start to bounce I'm lost
Crazy bout thickness, I get 'em with the quickness
My game is straight laced, no slickness
Witness the system pimp, never been simp
Other wanna-bes just LIMP
A THICK, RUMP, will make a +Nasty Dog+ 
Wanna STRAIGHT, HUMP, and if you make it bounce 
I'ma ACT, DRUNK, and chase it all around 
Until I BUMP, BUMP, no fronts in the grunts
A LITTLE, MISTAKE, she got into my car
Now the SHIRT, SHAKES, I'm hittin potholes 
Like EARTH, QUAKES, nothin 'bout the game
Is FAKE, CAKE OR jake!
You can bounce ya sixty-four
But it can't hang with a hotty gettin wild on the dance floor
And if ya can't make Soul Train, girl, don't pout
Bring it to me baby, *slurrrp* and let it beaounce

(Shake shake it mama)
<bounce> (Shake shake shake it mama)
Let it beaounce (Shake shake it mama)
<bounce> (Shake shake shake it mama)
Let it beaounce, baby (Shake shake it mama)
<bounce> (Shake shake shake it mama)
Let it beaounce (Shake shake it mama)
<bounce> (Shake shake shake it mama)

I've been checkin out you other rappers' videos
Never lookin at the rapper, just the hotty in the skippy clothes
And I gotta admit this
Mix-a-Lot'll ZOOMA-ZOOM-ZOOM these skirts wit the quickness
All y'alls girls is fly so I'ma give ya props
LOOK AT THEM GIRLS IN THE DAZZEY DUKES POP
Shake that thang like a salt shaker
Indecent proposal from the bank maker
Doo-doo brown can make the girls in my group get down
They couldn't sit down, so let that booty bounce around
And they'll throw it in yo face, checkin yo manhood
Ya wanna touch it if you're only good
The SMOOTH, SKIN, on top of that
The booty is BOO-MIN, shakin like a leaf 
To keep it MO-VIN, you disagree wit me
Then where have YOU, BEEN, livin on the end?
SIS BOOM BAH, I'm lovin to watch the body
Of a SOUL SISTAH, they're shakin they booties and makin em bounce
To OOH LA LA, tryin to get deep in they panties 
Is the MACK PAPA, change up,
IIIIIII'm the one to come undone and get all sprung 
When her butt swung I'm gettin high-strung
And all the strike a pose Vogue, miss girl, get out!

Just let it BEAOUNCE! 
BEAOUNCE!
Let it BEAOUNCE!
BEAOUNCE!
Let it BEAOUNCE!
BEAOUNCE!
Let it BEAOUNCE!
BEAOUNCE!
