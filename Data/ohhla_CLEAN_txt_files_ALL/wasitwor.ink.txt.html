Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Kid Ink]
Yeah, you been out on your own
Now tell me was it worth it
I think it's time to come home
You've been out on your own
Now tell me was it worth it

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Yes, looking back on what we had
It's clear to see you've got it bad, it's just like Usher said
Let it burn, and watch just how the tables turned
Don't know what you've got until it's gone is what you're goin' to learn
Truth is - ain't no need to lie, girl
You the baddest on the planet
But I can show you a better world
Freak, what is you wanting? I don't ever get too jealous
I know we got a connection that is tighter than your leggings, girl
Why you actin' dumb when I know just where your head is?
Super freaky in the bedroom, bet you they ain't seen the half of it
Go on and bring it back to me
Just make sure that you really ready 'fore you start unpackin' shit

[Chorus]
Now tell me, was it worth it?
Stop messing around with them lames
On the same bullshit, ain't gon' change
Now tell me, was it worth it?
I gave you a little space and time
But ain't no more she should waste
You I can show you better
Show you better, show you better than that
I know you better
Know you better, know you better than that
I can show you better
Show you better, show you better than that
I know you better
Know you better, know you better than that
Now tell me, was it worth it?

[Verse 2]
A whole lot of women in the club look in my direction
But you the one that I want, know you want the same thing
Why you tryna front in front of your friends' old hating ass?
They like "why you take him back?" I just need another chance
Show you what you missing on - know the feeling isn't gone
Let me get you high again - baby girl, it's hitting strong
I've been on some other shit, but I know that you've been alone
Go on and bring that ass home (woah)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I know you better than that, I'll show you better than that
And don't nobody in the world get it wetter than that
I've got money on my mind but my head in your lap
Your legs and your back
Whole word hear you screaming'
(Baby, baby, baby, baby...)
Baby, baby...
I think it's time to come home
You've been out on your own

[Chorus]</pre>
