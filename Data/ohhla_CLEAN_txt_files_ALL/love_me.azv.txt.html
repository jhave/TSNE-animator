Uh huh
Word Up..........
Drop the beat right here
Yeah

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Loooove me in a special way what more can I say
Love me now love love me now

[Verse 1]
Since Illmatic this shit started that never departed
I flossed retarded for them lost in the projects 
I taught them logic gaining courses in college
Chased dollars but to me whats most important is knowledge
Know the ledge for ya'll niggas that so on the edge
It ain't nothin for an infrared to go in your head
Life in the streets schooled me well movin light on my feet
So deep had me jumpin up at night in my sleep
Hold ya heat if you that nigga that's influencing beef
I'm trying to eat dont have me put two in ya feet
99 ways i made out to never fade out never get played out
Got guns blast ya way out

Chorus

[Verse 2]
Saw the worst when I was growing
Unknowing my quest until I had reality thrown at my chest
Why would it stress it seem a nigga zone at his best
Is it a test at times I feel my soul is possesed
Flavors of Guess throw key at major connects 
Crazy respect goin through it made me a vet
Gettin down on grounds forbidden
Made bails from ?????? to the cells in Clinton listen
We could war till we no more either or 
Or just ball till we all score it's on ya'll
Did this one for the streets watchin
And the D's in the streets let them keep clockin
We clean got love for the whole game
To go change fake I.D.'s and the code names but no lames
3 op's and theres more to come we all as one 
Recognize I been this raw since young

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Was I sent for the sinners that never repent
Or just another thug bent trying to pay for his rent
Days in contempt I see how ya'll amazed in suspense
Ways spent catch me at the major events
So blow a herb on ya corner curb my word
Doe or Die I was born a swerve bet that
From 40 bottles to the champagne twist a pop
White Lables to the brand names kids on top
And let's toast for the lost souls
And pray enough to hope and meet em at the crossroads reunite
Hope I live to see 88 with crazy cake
In a baby shaped burgandy Bentley with Haiti plates

Chorus 2X</pre>
