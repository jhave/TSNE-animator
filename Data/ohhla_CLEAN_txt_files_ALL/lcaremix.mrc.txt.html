Shorty
Turn it around, let me see somethin
Come with me, and there really gonna be somethin
I'm talkin lights, camera, action
Have me sayin' "I'm sorry Ms. Jackson"
Turn it around, let me see somethin
Come with me, and there really gonna be somethin
I'm talkin lights, camera, action
Have me saying "I'm sorry Ms. Jackson"

(P. Diddy)
It's time for some action
Camera's flashin
Everywhere, main attraction
They react like I'm one of the Jacksons
I guess it's just my name that attracts them
Remix

And I stay on your radio stations
Cuz I'm placed in heavy rotation
Remix

Tell the bartender to send another round to that
