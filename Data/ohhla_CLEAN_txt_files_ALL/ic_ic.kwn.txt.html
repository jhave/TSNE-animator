[Intro - Murphy Lee - talking]
I-I-I-I-I-I see some hoes..
In herrrre..

[J-Kwon - talking]
Ayo TrackBoyz..
Its cool if I bring my other cats
From St. Louis on this one?
Come on..

[Verse - Nelly]
Girl as you came through the door, you heard it before
Errbody in this bitch better hit the floor
Your man got some money, but I bet I got more
I heard he got a Bentley, but I bet it ain't a Zoure
She braggin' bout his Cadillac, bitch I got four
She keep runnin' his mouth I might go climb in four more

[Verse - J-Kwon]
I like 'em heavily beated, conceited, you can't beat it
Bust some pussy like a cookie wit no milk I can't-can't eat it
Okay you love me? no lie, but watch it my charm bright
That don't mean that you can kick it, from grippin' my arm tight
Plus you lookin good, that-that I can't perform right
In a U.S. club, down the lot p-p-pourin' right
Jamaica born, I don't mean to toot your horn right
But ya ass super fat, w-w-was you b-born right?
And right now, I'm just chillin' with MURPH DERT!
Your girl's in the club, but feelin' on MURPH DERT!
And half of these hoes be askin' for Nelly team
I don't know where Nelly team, but I know where my ding-a-ling
Kwon the new cat, who on the scene of things
And I'm pimpin' HOOES! you really ain't seen a thing
Maybe a moon ring or maybe some jelly beans
I mention the Four Seasons, I'm hittin' by any means
Cause..

[Hook - J-Kwon] -x2
I.....I see some hoes in herrrrre
And I.......I see some hoes..
In herrrrrrrrrrre

[Verse - Murphy Lee]
Ayo I'm Murphy Lee +The Ladies' Man+, I'm Leon Phelps the go-getter
I've been pimpin' since pimpin', even was pimpin' my babysitter (You not no pimp!)
I beg yo pardon I've been pimpin' since Kindygarten
She had the nicest boobies and remind me of Dolly Parton (Tits)
My First grade teacher bought my first set of markers
My Second grade teacher, she kind of favor Ms. Parker
Third grade: I switched schools, then my teacher was a dude
He taught me how to pimp the teachers into breakin' the rules, shoo.
My Fourth grade teacher man she had a badunkadunk
If I would shot from a 'A', she would give me a couple points
Fifth grade: I exposed my first ass, Sixth grade: I skipped my first class
Seventh grade: is when I first smashed, Eight grade: I smoked my first grass
Uh, I'm not a bad dude been on more backs then tattoos
Girl's scarred to say "Hi" so they just blush and just ask you
To ask me, autograph, pictures and hugs
I see a whole lot of women on the parking lot but more in the club
What up..

[Hook - J-Kwon] -x2
I.....I see some hoes in herrrrre
And I.......I see some hoes..
In herrrrrrrrrrre

[Verse - Ali]
Now in the V.I.P. I see so many hoes its hard for a playa to make a decision
One in therre with an ass so fat I seen it with my pimp view vision (OOH!)
You ain't got no panties on, my rep name: The Panic Zone
(Ali, is you a pimp?) Till I die, and I'm standin' on
It's nothin' to a boss, you'll fuck on what it costs
I'm the type to lose at dice and rob for what I lost
God Glory Hallelujahs, you miss a call I knew ya
And what's ya name? My name Ali, I wanna stick it to ya
Now as I sit therre and check ya, ya lookin' kind of tight but you act too fly to me.
Push this thing in ya mouth and right before I nut I pull it out and get ya E-Y-E.
Now you know I go hard on them know, got a pimp card that I show
And a bourgeois bitch, I dump cigars on that ho
Give a model something to swallow, send her back on the runway
Day off bitch? please we gon' double up on Sunday..

[Hook - J-Kwon] [Repeat until fade out]
I.....I see some hoes in herrrrre
And I.......I see some hoes..
In herrrrrrrrrrre</pre>
