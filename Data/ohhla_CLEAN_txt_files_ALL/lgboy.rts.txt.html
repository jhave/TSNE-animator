[Black Thought]
My grandmother suits was tailor made, Sundays Mahalia played
Simple familiar ways, like how she kneeled and prayed
Willin, master forgive us, our trust pastors had us real afraid
I never listened yet I still obeyed
I got to see how Philly played at such an early age
What my father was into sent him to his early grave
Then moms started chasin that base, like Willie Mays
My childhood was all of 40 nights and 40 days
Trouble was my ball and chain, shorties would call me names
Humble beginnings but a star is what it all became
My journey from a dirty hallway, to the Hall of Fame
Music my therapeutic way to cope with all this pain
Was headed for the drain, soakin before the rainwater came
And chaos, into the order came
I started doin what I'm 'sposed to do in life
Tryin to move out of the dark, and closer to the light
They say if you get a chance to do it, overdo it right
Tomorrow isn't promised every time, you say goodnight
Knahmtalkinabout? Uhh, yo
