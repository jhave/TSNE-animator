(Professor X talking)
It was the best of times; the worst of times
It was once said what goes around comes around
Welcome to da gathering
 
*Sample scratches*
 
[Professor X]
You said - "bow-wow"
I said - "ma-ma"
Marking and barking to the song
Come to form Jackal crew's swords
Thrust, to come back that rush
That systematic push - kush
As he profiles and must you - hush
What would you do when Chaos God come for you rude dude?
To turn you from thug pranksta to pro gangsta
Like Mutulu or Assata; I once robbed the Ramada
Bring pink, cash, my Jags like that to da gathering, sissy
Red, black, green with the key, feeling me?
 
(Chorus) Da Late Kidco
Yo, we be J A C K A L; for those who don't know we see above hell
Only when the time tell, knowledge and wisdom is where the mind was
You better prepare; we're spitting rhyme shell
Yo, we be J A C K A L; for those who don't know we see above hell
Only when the time tells, knowledge and wisdom is where the mind was
You better prepare; we're spitting rhyme shell
 
[Killah Priest]
I start spazzing, I black out, I'm grabbing the magnum
Clap at the dragon, the beast, they padded my streets
Organizing the hood, where it's national teeth
I wake up gasping for air, stabbing my sheets
Sweat pouring in my sleep, I hear death calling
And when he knocks I'm beneath my desk crawling
And if he catch me
May I rest like King Tut with my spirits beamed up
And the emerald land of green dust
And I'm the mummy that rises out of the tomb
Inhale deep within my lungs and speak out to the moon
We're the Jackals, feel million hands grab you
Beneath the sands in our hidden castles
Priest and Chaos "The Overseer" like radar
And explode in space like quasars
 
(Chorus) Da Late Kidco
 
[Da Late Kidco]
Yo, stay well protected
Another quote with another message
My third eye bless my mind; the living essence
I jack for my looks and presence
To wanting to touch a mic
It burns through the pinnacle cord
It's just like a blue fluorescent
I'm all about success
My Jackal soldiers will put you to rest
And leave your body in a bloody mess
We're on the road vibing, the Natural high
We see the world through facts of the lies
That's why you see the black in the eyes
I'm true to this game, no actualize
Build track, place raps down with accurate wise
We out to keep the faith in the state
And plan against the Jakes
Take piece of the cake then run for the pearly gate
We're straight soldiers on the real mission
We fight till the death first to get my sisters out the shiesty system
Another symptom from this world explosive
I left you with a dosage, with high voltage
This is for my dock of vultures, what?
 
(Professor X talking)
That the introduction, be warned, protected
Thou be baby, now to the Temple on
And the Jackal wolves begin, if you dare</pre>
