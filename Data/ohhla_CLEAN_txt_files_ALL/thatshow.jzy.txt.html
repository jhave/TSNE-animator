Looking at you cause you got the big boy shoes on ya shit my nigga
Ay roll down ya motherfucking window nigga
Blow out that dro smoke nigga
Tell that nigga that's how the fuck ya feel nigga
Ya feel like ya look nigga
Ya feel good nigga
What's happening nigga?
Let's get it, ay
Ay, let's go

[Young Jeezy]
Red paint, inside's peanut butter (peanut butter)
They seeing me, but I don't see them suckers (see them suckers)
I ain't gon lie, man my shit tight (tight)
Hoes jocking, got em stopping like a red light (ay, yeeeeeeah)
Wake me up, this a sick dream (what)
Got the Alpine with the flat screen (that's right)
These niggaz ain't aware mayne (ware mayne)
12's in the trunk sounding like an airplane (ay, ay, jeah)
A 757 jet (jet)
He ain't know? You dealing with a fucking vet (yeeeeeah)
niggaz cold like banana splits (jeah)
That's why I cop the AR with banana clips (ay, ay)

[Hook x2]
Sitting 24 inches off the ground (That's how ya feel)
A young nigga sellin fruity by the pound (That's how ya feel)
And I got the best white in the town (That's how ya feel)
45 in my lap, it's going down (That's how ya feel)

[Young Jeezy]
I got a project chick with a lot of kids (lot of kids)
She say she like my flow but love my ad libs (yeeeeeah)
I was saying Yeah before Usher (what)
Never Scared like T.I. and Bone Crusher (that's right)
Any problem, Jeezy take care of it (jeah)
Them ugly hoes say a nigga arrogant (arrogant)
Real slow is how I drive past (what)
Got everybody looking, sweating like a gym class (let's get it)
I see you funny niggaz got jokes (jokes)
Disrespect the Chevy, still riding on spokes (ay, spokes)
You fucking with a player (ay)
We don't just say no, we too busy saying yeeeeeah

[Hook x2]
Sitting 24 inches off the ground (That's how ya feel)
A young nigga sellin fruity by the pound (That's how ya feel)
And I got the best white in the town (That's how ya feel)
45 in my lap, it's going down (That's how ya feel)

[Young Jeezy]
I'm a motherfucking problem, who wanna solve me dog? (jeah) 
Got six cell phones, who gon' call me dog? (yeeeeeah)
This ain't a movie, we are not actors (what)
Still use a duck ass nigga for target practice (ay)
Infrared beam on the Mausberg pump
Hit his ass with it twice, make him A-Town Stomp (A-Town Stomp)
In gats we trust (ay)
niggaz play a lot of games dog, but not with us (not with us)
Call me Jack In The Box, hop out with two clips (jeah)
Cook ya faster than a t-bone at Ruth Chris (Ruth Chris)
You still hating, looking stupid (looking stupid)
I'm in the SL, looking real Coupe-ish (real Coupe-ish)

[Hook x2]
Sitting 24 inches off the ground (That's how ya feel)
A young nigga sellin fruity by the pound (That's how ya feel)
And I got the best white in the town (That's how ya feel)
45 in my lap, it's going down (That's how ya feel)</pre>
