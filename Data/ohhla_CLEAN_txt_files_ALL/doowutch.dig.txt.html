Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh

Now as the record spins around, you recognize this sound,
Well, it's the underground, 
You know that we're down with wutchyalike
Yeah, with wutchyalike, yeah
And though we're usually on the serious tip, check it out:
Tonight we're gonna flip and trip and let it all hang out tonight,
We're gonna say what we like.
'Cause, yo, yo, we wanna know how many people in the flow,
Would like to just let yourselves go 
And doowutchyalike,
Yeah, well tonight's your night.
Just eat food, try not to be crude or rude,
Kill the attitude, chill the serious mood, 
And doowutchyalike,
Yeah, and doowutchyalike, 
Everybody doowutchyalike

Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Yeah, doowutchyalike
Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh

Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Yo, go whereyalike
Ooh, I see, I see, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh

I mean rich, poor, high, low, or upper-middle class,
Let's all get together and have a few laughs 
And doowhatwelike
Yeah, and doowhatwelike, yeah, and doowhatwelike.
And since you came here you gotta show and prove,
And do thatdance, until it don't move, 
Doowutchyalike, 
Sometimes I bite.
Now if you're hungry, get yourself something to eat,
And if you're dirty, then go take a bath.
Messed up the line?
Nope, sometimes I don't rhyme.
Help yourself to a cracker, with a spread of cheddar cheese,
Have a neck bone, you don't have to say please
Eatwutchyalike, yo, smellhowyalike.
Everybody doowutchyalike

Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Doowutchyalike
Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Yo, doowutchyalike, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Whatever you like to do...talkhowyalike
Ooh, I see, I see, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh

Just act a fool, it's okay if you drool,
'Cause everybody's gonna strip, and jump in the pool,
And doowhatwelike, yeah, and doowhatwelike.
Homegirls, for once, forget you got class,
See a guy you like: just grab 'im in the biscuits!
And doowutchyalike.
Now, red, white, black, tan, yellow, or brown,
It really doesn't matter, we can all get down,
And doowhatwelike, yeah, and doowhatwelike.
From a pink-skinned yankee, to a blue black southerner,
Ditch digger or a governor,
Just doowutchyalike, 
Lookhowyalike,
Now don't you know we're gettin' busy, it can't be corrected,
??? had to be deaf
I say whatIlike,
Like I said, sometimes we bite,
Even though you don't think it's right,
Yo, I like to bite,
Just havin' fun y'all, and if you think that it's wrong, 
You got to admit, it's a new type of song,
Doowutchyalike,

gathering, we will now allow the beat to continue, and proceed to give 
you more of what you like.  This message has been brought to you by the 
makers of the way we swing, and the underground talkhowyalike posse.

[Ah, ah, ah, I feel like a nice big bowl of cereal, icy cold milk]
[Daddy, can I eat some ice cream?]
[Look, I told you kid, eatwutchyalike, ok?]
Now the beat goes on 'til the break of dawn,
And just peep this, y'all, 'cause we're singin' a song,
And doowutchyalike, yeah doowutchyalike
And since you came here you gotta show and prove,
And do that dance, until it don't move,
And doowutchyalike,
Like I said, sometimes we bite
Now we're all gettin' stupid, and actin' a fool,
Anything that ya really wanna do is cool,
So, Goldfingers, cutwutchyalike
[Now let me tell you who I am...Ah shit...]
Now if you're hungry, get yourself something to eat,
And if you're dirty, then go take a bath,
And doowutchyalike.
Stetsasonics, adjust for the hip-hop fans,
And since we're not your average everyday rap band,
Yo, Pianoman, playhowyalike
{piano solo}

Just act a fool, it's okay if you drool,
'Cause everybody's gonna strip, and jump in the pool,
[Wait a minute, wait a minute, don't take your clothes off yet, not yet, 
wait 'til we get home]
Now if you wear corrective shoes and you got big bunyons,
Toenails smell and look like onions,
Don't doowutchyalike--
Go see a foot doctor tonight!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody doowutchyalike

Ooh, ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Yeah, doowutchyalike,
Ooh, ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, I see, I see, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Ah, everybody doowutchyalike,
Ooh, ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh

Straight hair, curled, casual and glamor,
A shy girl, or loud like a bama.
From Connecticut, or from Louisiana,
Bad table ettiqutte, too much chatter,
Very well spoken, or real bad grammer,
I minority token, a brother in the slammer,
A free civilian with a house in Santa Ana,
If ya got a million, and live in Atlanta,
If you got a weak bladder, or can't climb a ladder,
What we're sayin' is, it really doesn't matter,
I need a word that sounds like "atta"
Slipped on a peel of banana,
Doowutchyalike.
[Yeah, cool, gettin' stupid, once again, you got the sound of the 
underground.  Baby dope is in the house.]
[Boyyy!!]
[Are we puttin' things in check, Baby D?]
[Too stupid check]
[I'm wit' it.  Yo Dave, let's show 'em some old school]
It makes no sense just standin' around,
Come on everybody, let's all...[Hang out]
Yeah, and doowutwelike,
From a lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime,
Come on, young ladies, let's have...[Good times]
And doowutwelike.
Now, I can sing, I can dance, I'm the king of romance,
Are you sweet young ladies gonna give me a chance,
To doowutchyalike?
And get that thing packed tonight.
Vanessa Williams, ooh, you're so divine, 
Just wanted to put your name in my rhyme,
And doowutchyalike,
Yeah, everybody doowutchyalike.
[Hey, how 'bout you and me just go in the back room right now? Ok? just 
me and you]

Ooh, ooh
[Yo, don't take your clothes off, not yet]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
 [Gowhereyalike, and since you came here you gotta show and prove]
I see, I see, I see guys and girls dancin' 
 [Sometimes I blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah]
I see, I see, I see guys and girls dancin'
 [If you're fat, hungry, dirty, and need to take a bath: go wash your feet]
I see, I see, I see, I see, I see guys and girls dancin'
I see, I see, I see, I see, I see guys and girls dancin'
[Just buggin' in the place to be, you got the sound of Shock G]
End the record howwelike!
