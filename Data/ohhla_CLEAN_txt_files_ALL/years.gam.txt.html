Intro: C-murder (talking) with Porsha singing. 
This is a story about my childhood years. 
For all my niggas. 
For my life as a ghetto child. 
. Theres so much pain 

Verse 1: ???? 
I remember as a little kid. 
Growing up. Many of my friends didnt make it up to bricks. 
Punished for the shit that they did, it gets so hard to live. 
Mama cut the same tears, livin in fears. 
Wondering if their son died or survived. 
But mama, Im cutting the 45. 
I die, tell mama dont cry. 
Dry eyes, cause how I live. I know to smile. 
A young misbehaved child, running in the streets wild. 
Try to make my money, pop. 
My eyes are getting slim. 
And my life is getting down, and I feeling like death is near. 
And Im hoping that the heavens here. 
I cry, cause the Lord knows how m! any years Ive tried. 
But this lifes a lie. It aint not a hope unless a nigga die. 
Lord why!!, Lord why!! 

Verse 2: ???? 
My childhood years was kinda rough because my pops werent there. 
I was left to peer. Always pay but no one to share. 
These hard times, stressin to sell nickels and dimes. 
Had to support my family, no one else was puttin time. 
Reminiscing about on dead peers troughout the the years. 
No more tears, my childhood years with scrilla fifth. 
Whos the maycliff for all this fucking fight to stop a nigga. 
Just a price I have to pay, nigga. 
My childhood years 

Chorus repeated once: C-Murder (Porsha singing in the background) 
My childhood years, got my shit in tears. 
Its hella scary. 
Im trapped, and I dont wanna die in a cemetery. 
This ghetto ties got me livin in pain. 
Lord knows I dont wanna die in vain. 

Verse 3: C-Murder 
My childhood years was spend in cemeteries bearing my peers. 
Many tears, that I have shaded, for my niggas disappeared. 
In a bad year. Now with depressed in just memory. 
Drinking Hennessy. To dry away my misery. 
Trapped since birth, a ghetto child living in curse. 
Its getting worse, until Im covered up in dirt. 
The pain it hurts. 
That be the reason why my blast first. 
Cause I refuse to be a victim in the black hears. 
Memories up with child runnin wild. 
I couldnt smile, because my motherfuckin life was foul. 
A troubled child, stressin from his childhood years. 
Heavenly father. Could you please wipe away my tears. 

Verse 4: Reginelli 
I could remember way back, when a! nigga was sick. 
I just to watch my brother do some dangerous shit. 
Staying out all night, mama worrying sick. 
Wondering if he was dead or just play with a bitch. 
But when I saw this wild nigga came up like I did. 
When I eat dwellars, when the niggas start to slanging that shit. 
I tight up on my hustle. Start to paying the bills. 
Shading tills, cause my brother got locked up for three years. 
After that a nigga start to grabbin the mic. 
Write rap, on sheet of paper, making solider shit tight. 
Three years later, my brother came home from jail. 
Tellin me he wrote rap, when he was strapped in a cell. 
A week later, we was some No limit soliders. 
Gambino family, for all the readers and rollers. 
But you can tell a nigga been shading some tears. 
By the way I live. 
My childhood years. 

Chorus repeated once. 

Outro: C-murder (talking) with Porsha singing 

Childhood years. 
Shading tears. 
For ! all my dead peers. 
Hard time strapped in the game.
