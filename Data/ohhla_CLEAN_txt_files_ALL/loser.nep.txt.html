[Intro: Shay] + (Pharrell)
We gotta win (yeah) we gotta win (yeah)
We gotta wi-in (we gotta win)
We gotta win (yeah) cause I'm a win (yeah)
(Spymob vocalist: yeah yeah) (We gotta win)
We gotta win (yeah) we gotta win (yeah)
We gotta wi-in (we gotta win)
See I'm a win, I'm a win

[Chorus: Spymob vocalist &amp; Pharrell] + (Shay)
We will not be the losers (losers)
We won't won't leave till our job is done (noo)
We will not be the losers (losers)
Sorry but we're not the ones, yeah!

[Verse 1: Pharrell &amp; Spymob vocalist] + (Shay)
I will have my eyes focused plant my feet on the ground
I will run through the middle and lay them all down
I'm the carrier of the torch to make my path I will burn
The world (yeah) must learn

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
I know they are coming to do what they can
I'll stab 'em and smash them, I'll face them like a man
I know I must face my country, I have to face my town
So I can't, let them down

[Pusha T] + (Pharrell)
Look at me runnin', endzone I'm comin
One's on my back I be floatin' (Ah)
The stadium loud, my mother be proud
Her eyes is teary, she chokin' (Aaah)
We did this for who? the ones who were true
Supporting this dream that I'm livin' (Aaah)
And for my squad, the whole nine yards
The name of my team I'm defending

[Malice] + (Pharrell)
Sometimes it seems all wrong, I won't stop till it's all gone
As I leap for the long bomb (Aaah)
You know me, number fo' fo'
Blast through life, running back but in slow mo' (Aaah)
I'm a veteran, prize to the better man
Just like the medal lands, ran like I never ran (Aaah)
In this game of life, we gon' play ball
Us against them, we gon' lay them all

[Shay]
We will not be the losers
We won't won't leave till our job is done

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Pharrell] + (Spymob vocalist)
I'm prepared to go the distance and battle to the end
I will fight through the twilight to see my family again
But the desert is so cloudy and it is hard to see
There's chance that, and that chance is me (Yeah!)

[Outro: Shay]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah!
Cause I'ma win, 'cause I'ma win
Cause I'ma wi-in
Cause I'ma win, 'cause I'ma win
Cause I'ma win, 'cause I'ma win
Cause I'ma wi-in
Cause I'ma win, 'cause I'ma win</pre>
