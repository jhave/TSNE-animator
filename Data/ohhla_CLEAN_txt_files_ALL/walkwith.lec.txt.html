[Lecrae]
I get a little weak sometimes
Teach me the way, night and day

Oh, I'm under pressure, man, I'm under pressure
Been tryna walk it out I keep ended up a stretcha
Problems in life'll stretch ya', ain't got it all together
They say the change comin', but it's feelin like forever
Oh, I'm on mission, they probably think missin'
Some screws, but it's these three nails that keep me drivin'
If God ain't with me, I know that I'm gon fail
And ain't a wish in the well that can wish ya' boy well
Cells eaten by cancer got me lookin for answers
Doctors say my daughter won't grow up to be a dancer
Just walked out that funeral, I'm right back in my cubicle
Lord, I'm ready for heaven; I'm just waitin on the cue to go
Feel like givin up and just blamin it on my daddy
He never meant to have me, and problems keep comin at me
I wanna walk with Jesus, but my legs too heavy
I'm hopin prayer works 'cause the walls can't hear me
Come on!

[Chorus: Novel]
So I drop to my knees and I scream with my might
I'm know that these walls can't hear me
I say Lord, please won't you hear my cry?
I know that these walls can't hear me
Maybe if I plead and I sing out loud
I know that these walls can't hear me
Jesus come walk, come walk with me now
Cause I know that these walls can't hear me

[Lecrae]
Oh, D Wade died first, now my Uncle Skip gone
Then I lost my grandpa, and that's when it hit home
That people keep leavin me, this world keep deceiving me
They sellin me false hope, and I keep believing it
Come on! I promise I think I'm going insane
Come on! And gravity pullin me down the drain
Come on! My boys in Afghanistan goin crazy
Staring at them pictures of they babies
Bullets flyin everywhere, prayin they gon make it home
Lord, give 'em hope - without it, what else they bankin on?
Everything is fallin all around me, put yo' arms around me
Sinkin in my sorrows got me drowning
Tempted to empty bottles and throw 'em off in wind
Devils lurkin 'round the corner, just waitin for me to sin
I pray that you sustain me and keep me from givin in
Ain't gotta get me out; just get through to the end!!!
Lord Jesus, come on!

[Chorus]
See I need some healing
Cause I'm losing feeling
Lord won't you please hear my cry, yeah
Let your love rain from the sky
