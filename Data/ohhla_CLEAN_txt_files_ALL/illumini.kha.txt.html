(Imam THUG)
Yeah... that real shit... 
Imam Thug, burstin' out the coccoon, like that
Apples just droppin' from the tree
That's a'ight though...

Yo, yo yo yo yo
I'll be the last man standing in the middle of a major war
B.C. - cavemen and dinosaurs
Laws were unlike mine and yours
They got some type of shit they put up in your fuckin' drawers
Try to feel 'em out - figure out the major flaws
Thinkin' I could catch one in the back of Mecca halls
See my face posted in about a hundred stores
Missing - last seen at the ?lab? convention
Time-warp coincides with the mic cord
Savage beast - each trait meet

(Tragedy Khadafi)
We('re) like Neanderthals trapped in ice to be precise
Microchip in your body like Blood of Christ
I fast forty days and pray for forty nights
Return to the essence of Life for all life
Conceived in the Earth and placed upon walls
Resting in the pyramid, wake when night falls
Bless me with the gat and clips to be injected
To the next life it changed my whole perspective
Slaughtering my children - Gentiles and Romans
I'm holding - swords and gats for evil omens
Mark of the beast imprint were being sewed in
To the last day they say - world exploding
1999 ?null refined?
Internet web control your whole mind
My third eye shine insight to lead the blind
A hundred and forty-four thousand more crimes
A fugitive who's wanted by feds of all kinds
For waking up thugs and showing them true signs
True signs(true signs)
For the blind
Two-Five, forever shine

Been on this planet for 25 years but still bleeding
Internally - trapped in Hell but still breathing
Caught up in the Empire State - Garden of Eden
Millennia surround my life for wrong reasons
I didn't ask to be here, god, see I was placed
Amongst Canaanites with six carved in face
Holding all the gods up north behind gates
Amorites ruling the world and all states
True lies coming from tongues of true snakes
La ilaha la ila Allah
Gomar Oz Dubar
We shine like North Star

CNN - Two-Five forever
