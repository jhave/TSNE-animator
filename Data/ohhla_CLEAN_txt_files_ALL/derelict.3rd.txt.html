	The great will always soar, above, the mediocre
	They create, while others destroy

[Pete Nice]
Never had a wasted mind, had the time
Erectin rhyme I cause gifted lines
The flows I knows puts the papers in pockets
Swings of things, observed in my sockets
In ten spot I got stacks of LP wax
Couderoy slacks, loops and sales tax
On the racks but my label is Derelict
Spic-n-Span I slam, it's balls you lick
Ill missions, but doin us ain't even simple
Stereotype the rhymer as a criminal
Subliminal I put a noose on the necks
The sinister signs of my rhymes is sex

..

[MC Serch]
Smooth, set-up so slick 
as I set to move, all the great masses
Asses bounce to track that is all in
I'm droppin my quarter, I'm placin my call in
to my crew that's down with the street trends
Play around and you'll fall off the deep end
I heard your hooker she likes to do knee-bends
But I got a girl, so I called up three friends
And they called three friends (and I called three friends)
And so on, and so on, and so on..
So go on my path, and try to follow
but not step for step, cause I like to sidestep
You'll get swept like a broom and you'll make room for daddy
White boy in New York and I can't get a cab G
So take me to my rest so I guess I'll get wrecked
cause I'm a derelict of dialect

..

[Pete Nice]
Dialect spoken, in sectional lesson
The less you know, the more you gotta guess on
I press on point, some sweat my jizznoint
Playin themselves with the fingers the point
I speak slow, I carry a fat stick
Get your kneepads and reapply your chapstick
Step to this, as the Derelict reanimates
No jim hat as my mouth ejaculates
I stays mumble, I speaks jumble
Phonetics on phonograph'll prime your petrol
Retroactive, my knot scale is tipped off
I rip the head off, the Derelict stepped off
and left to show this, to those who typecast
Ill the rhyme-ass trickster or outcast
of intellect, I wreck shit with my own sect
The ace in the hole, I'm the Derelict of Dialect

..

[MC Serch]
3rd Bass, but not a bass for slidin
Foundation, for a nation who's mind is 
in motion, goin in fluid
Who did you just distrust? It's Serch and I crush this
mental need for oppression
Oppressed and all vexed and just placed a suggestion
Lesson or loss enforce those in
a spot who got your head frozen
Defrost the eye and spy on the serpent
On act two, he tried to close curtain
But intermission I glimpsed and I clock more
Derelicts watch act three and the encore

	Individuals who are never satisfied with the static standards
	set by the masses -- the masses have always been lethargic
	They have always opposed greatness for it is beyond them
	to even.. comprehend greatness</pre>
