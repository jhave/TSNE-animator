(Chorus - Swizz Beatz)
My blood pressure's buildin' (4x)
It's Cassidy trick
It's Cassidy bitch
It's Cassidy clique
It's Cassidy beeyatch!

(Verse 1 - Cassidy)
Ayo, what'chu know 'bout this world I'm in
Everynight I twist up and get drunk 'til I hurl again
Then i'll pour some more and start twirlin' then
And might go and get my pipes up by your girl and them
If you a thug, stop girlin' then
If I see a car in traffic, I'm a jacket like Burlington
It's Cassidy, who's thorough as him, nobody
I keep a gun tucked cause I don't trust nobody
I got plenty biscuits
And ya'll niggaz like skinny bitches yall ain't got nobodies
Watch how you talk to me man
Before you faggots get smacked with the dark skin part of my hand
Understand?

(Repeat Chorus)

(Verse 2)
I'm the best in building, a prospect destined for millions
Threat to civillians and my blood pressure is building
Catch feelings? You be wet, catchin' a steel in
Weapons directed, at ya' chest, neck and ya' grill and
Still, there's no regrets, but I confessed that I kill men
I spill men's blood on the rug next to there children
And if you wan' set it? Cass' bettin' his deal in
Yes I will win, when I spill extra appealin'
Come to Limekill, we got them exstasy pills and
Got the whip fully equiped except for the ceilin'
I got a stash in it, the Smith-n-Wessun can chill in
I might get arressted, but until then?

(Repeat Chorus)

(Verse 3)
If I hear you gettin' chips, pitbulls where you sleepin'
Everybody on the fuckin' floor, I'm squeezin'
Click the four, grip your whore by her weave and
Bitch, what muthafuckin' drawer is the keys in?
Got you on your knees like a braud and you pleadin'
(Uh, you got it dog, take it all, I don't need it)
I'll clap you and have you on your carpet, bleedin'
Throw your stuff in the trunk of the Ford then I'm leavin
Now I got a raw load more than I'm needin
And that's the reason, why you and whore is screamin'
Pull this, squeezed then if you holdin' them hammers
I'm focused like disposable cameras, nigga!

(Repeat Chorus until end)</pre>
