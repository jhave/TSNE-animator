Yall can't mess with us

[Pitbull]
This like mother nature
I really don't give a fuck
We can do it in the club
We can do it outside
We can do it right now what
Little buddie easie up
Please don't cross me like Jesus
I ain't got nothing to prove
As a matter fact I done proved everybody wrong yes sir
Only chico in the south yes sir that's putting it down yes sir
That would be me P.I.T. yes sir
Its all supply and demand
Me I supply the demand
I understand that y'all wanna be me cause I am the man
Mommie threw me on my back and I was like I was like dammit man
Then she jump on my mouth and I was like I was like Hum hum hum hum
One mo-gin
Mommie threw me on my back and I was like I was like dammit man
Then she jump on my mouth and I was like I was like Hum hum hum hum
Dam Jimmie I wish you were here now
Rest in peace to that chico name Screw
Thanks for believing in me this ones for you

[Chorus]

[Lil' Flip]
Yep yep
When I pull up they like dammit man
In that black Phantum man
Cause they can't stand it man
Chain 200 grand
Watch with matchin band
I'm rockin 3 clovas (Why?)
I'm from clova land
I'm drinkin grey goose
You drinkin redbull
I hang with Zero
I roll with Pitbull
28 we tip on
Candy paint we drip wet
I be in New York with Killa Cam and Dip Set
I'm packin2 bangers the other rapper ain't gangsta (Why?)
You had to say my name and you still ain't famous (Dam)
Clover G's don't take no shit we bake them bitches to come up
Keep runnin you lip my gun on my hip so don't run up
Creepin on a come up
With million dollar shoe deal
Old cars with new wheels
Yellow rocks in blue steal
You know Lil Flip got skills
You know Lil Flip got mills
You can ask B.E.T how the fuck I live
They know Im rich as fuck
So nuck if you buck
Cause down in Houston Texas
We jammit screwed up
We riddin 84's and we also poppin trunk</pre>
