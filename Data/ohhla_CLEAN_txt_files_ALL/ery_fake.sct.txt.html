Song:   Everybody Fake
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x2]
Seems like everybody's fake, all I know is big faces
I ain't got time for no safe, too much money in the way
So much vultures where I stay, they'll rob you bare face
I can't fuck around with these bitches, too much money in the way

[Verse 1]
All I know is that bitch fake
The Jackson grips and the Ben Franklins
Stacking up dead presidents, I got a graveyard in my big safe
Never hit my phone if you need to wait
You can slide through the trap if you need the bass
I be making bands like Diddy did
When I'm on the run for my cheese cake
Cause I chase paper like chasing liquor
I don't fucks with you hating niggas
Bitch ways  they relate the bitches
If I'm the shit then they play some tension
Let me look you up when they rollin up
We gonna press this on, they play quicker
That's why I paid my essays off
So they can cut my grass and you a snake nigga
Just every nigga you see me with
They grew up with me since day 1
I only fuck with my real niggas, that's thick sauce, they A1
I'm full of you fake niggas
You fake niggas can't stand the truth
For them chickens I'll bust yo noodles
And ain't talkin bout can of soup

[Chorus: x2]
Seems like everybody's fake, all I know is big faces
I ain't got time for no safe, too much money in the way
So much vultures where I stay, they'll rob you bare face
I can't fuck around with these bitches, too much money in the way

[Verse 2]
I'm ridin with all this money  that's probably why they hate
All that plottin, rattin on Scooter  gon get shot right in yo face
Nigga call yo self a real nigga but he turned his faith
I was pissed they would know he would probably have no cake
Fuck the police to prosecutor and everybody who's snitchin
Whatever you do in the streets, don't bring no hoe around no trigger
Cause bitches set up licks, they get caught with they snitchin
Nigga test it, get 30 year, fuck boy shoulda mind his business
Can't trust nobody in the streets no mo, right now this shit too fake
That's why I keep them same niggas with me every day
BMG and R6, got rich off pullin tricks
I'm a blow myself so I don't need nobody bricks

[Chorus: x2]
Seems like everybody's fake, all I know is big faces
I ain't got time for no safe, too much money in the way
So much vultures where I stay, they'll rob you bare face
I can't fuck around with these bitches, too much money in the way</pre>
