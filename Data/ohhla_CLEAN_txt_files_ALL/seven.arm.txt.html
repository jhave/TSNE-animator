[Verse 1: Planetary]
Yeah! Yo, uh
A lotta rappers try approaching the omen in my palm
So punish your people while I'm up on the podium
Pharaohs folding 'em, like washed clothes again
I'm a vulture when the flow go choke your kin
Broke, I leave most of them, slow, I keep my motionin'
Eye on the prize
I silence the wise, my lyrics make a scientist cry
Making a secret society expose their purpose
Making 'em release info and exploding my surface
I'm taking my time to birth this, rap entity earthless
It's show time, there's no time, we ready when the curtain split
I'm hurting shit, too powerful for painkillers
On the concrete jungle, we walk like trained guerillas
Untamed, and my niggas is kane
Kool G, Rakim, combine into one frame
We like the new mecca of immaculate rappers
Vinnie Paz, call the ghouls, now we back with the clappers

[Verse 2: Chief Kamachi]
Yo
The man silent, kill him with what I mentally says
Bloody Fez, choke you like and Indian rez
Kamach, animal Turk, sick with a cannibal smirk
Welcome, this where the murderers lurk
It's my mind, to make sure that the Sun can work
Scorch bodies, leave all of your gunmen hurt
Pharaoh sultans, create a serious cult jam
And my hand is where the tears and the pope ran
They stay watching like they keep me on a scope cam
I'm in heaven with the angels that smoke grams
You need God, that's why the earth so damned
International, trying to get my flow banned
That's cool, if I don't kick these prayers
A lot of flood and famines gonna hit these years
Kamachi back on the chapel stairs
Open the clouds, let the thunder clap your ears

[Verse 3: King Syze]
If you wanna put your money up then muthafucker then put it
for your family's sanity man, I wish that you wouldn't
Niggas got nice flows, just dont know where to put it
And I know your whole life your raps, unedited footage
And y'all mixtape niggas couldnt see my platoes
All up in my presence, why y'all actin' bashful?
King Syze cats and any clique they rap flo
Y'all little light niggas couldn't feed my shadows
From, city to city, intersection to section
But you reflexin', with or without a weapon
I'm always steppin', never scared
But always and forever prepared
Yeah the ones who drink gas man It's (??)

[Verse 4: Reef the Lost Cauze]
You now rocking with the foulest clique in the continent
Total dominance, rise to prominence
In my prime like Optimus, stand in astonishment
Actors can glamour it, and access the evil
I know where Osama is, he down in Camp David
Down and dirty like a damp basement
The champ must demand greatness
From himself, or be another contender
Theres 100's of niggas
Dead left under the river
From the days of slaves
To hurricanes in Orleans
See my people's grapes floatin' amongst the waves
It's hell to pay, what?
The devil don't take cheques
I tried to send a message to God
His phone don't take texts
I need a new plan, a crook with knowlegde
Times is hard homie, why I took them dollars
Man, my momma got a mortgage
And my little baby sister needs books for college
I rob all of y'all

[Verse 5: Doap Nixion]
Hey yo
They want the hood in here so they called me first
I get 'em rappers gatorade cause they ball with thirst, UH!
This is more then music
But these niggas is mad trash
That's why the stores refuse 'em
Yo, I'm out in Georgia, went straight to the block
I'm seein' cats motorcyclin' dawg, I'm doin the walk
I'm an O.G., I call my tire niggas a wop
Though their papers ain't right, but they got weight on the block
I love 'em uh
Hand to hand, see your hands ache
I drunk so much syrup dawg I stopped eatin' pancakes
Ya niggas cool dawg mine's absurd hot
Stop frontin' like you's a killer money, your nerves shot
Yo you's a paxel nigga, dumpin' zolof in coffee
AOTP what exhaust be
Can't keep it gear, cause I'm blinging with F's
But I got my mom right so swing your shit to the left

[Verse 6: Demoz]
Nigga, if I had 24 hours to live
Fuck, 24 hours, gimme 24 seconds
Vin I'm drivin' off a bridge
Broken rib, no windshield, covered in carosine
Gasoline, tank filled to the top
Magazines of these phony rappers ripped in pieces
No preechers, strong enough to take me out of my zone
I broke Jesus, broke niggas who squeal
Rob niggas who steal, kill niggas who kill
I'm too sick for a pill
Man these niggas ain't real, they're real fake
They say they a man but they fuckin' with real snakes
That's when you put 'em in a truck with their grill taped
Rip in reverse and run into a stealgate
I'm a suicide driver, never been a liar
If I don't kill you later, I'ma kill you mañana
You don't want no problems
You don't want no drama
Nigga I'ma take a trip with your baby momma, suicide driver

[Verse 7: Celph Titled]
Ya better cross your T's
Cause we'll dot your eyes
You can say that you're specialized but pharaohs will optimize
Backstage will get a bitch backsmacked there
The macplayer like dirty south pimpslapped clap snares, YEAH!
Holy paragraphs, what kind of shit is that?
I'm Jesus in the flesh so this is motherfuckin' christian rap
Y'all just Christmas wrap, must be the secret Santa
My reindeer aim near, pierce you with the antlers
I made 'em go easy, and called off the wolves on my AOTP radio CB
Cause y'all ain't worthy of grenades and RPG's
Slit throat, hope you float with sardines and seaweed
Cause this is C-E-L-P-H demonic symphony
Listen to the hell we make
In a year before your kids 10th birthday came
You didn't have to wait for candles on the cake to see the nine flame

[Verse 8: Vinnie Paz]
Respect a G, my clique clap at you excessively
I lay back and drink alcohol excessively
It ain't a rapper that's alive today that's testing me
I got degrees in being ignorant and weaponry
A 40 oz of Dutch Master is the recipe
That's my shit there, that'll be the death of me
Give me a death mask, better yet an effigy
I understand the math of death and it's complexity
I understand how you was violently murked
I understand how you was raised under the lies of the church (laughter)
But understand I recognize that I'm cursed
With the ability to end your fucking lives with a verse</pre>
