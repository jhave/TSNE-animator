[Intro]
Greetings boys and girls
(Greetings boys and girls)
My name is Petey P. 
(My name is Petey P.)
Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend (that's right, that's right, that's right)
I am your neighbor (I am your neighbor)
And I'd like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city (good kid, m.A.A.d city)
So grab your cartoons and cereal (and sing)
Your pop guns (and sing) and fireworks and sing along

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Sing along kids, sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah

(Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was...)

[Kendrick]
I've been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at 95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
we was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers to move
With nothing else to lose but a burger flippin' job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine this a mansion
Gold ballroom AK-47 dancing
Howling at the moon was a pack of hungry babies
Hope you feed 'em soon bite your back you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table of Sizzlers
But never made that visit, if better days was on its way
Then it made the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
(Oh yeah I remember that, it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?)

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (Am I right?)
Spend it all in front of the county building (oh)
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah

And all the ghetto children in the world say that's my car
All the ghetto boys say that's my car
All the ghetto girls say that's my car
When we grow up, when we grow up
Ghetto children in the world say that's my car
All the ghetto boys say that's my car
All the ghetto girls say that's my car
When we grow up, when we grow up

(Nig-nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?)

[Kendrick]
Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety (uh huh)
Played the passenger I think it's five years after eighty-
seven do the math ' 92 don't you be lazy (I won't)
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
of a block party that stop for a second then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle everybody got dental
Insurance 'cause we 'bout to floss
you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away probably had credentials
of a scholar but shit not today
them Dayton spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi I want them ten woo-woofers
Say that you got me if not I'll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bull's eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
Papa you really telling me we can just get some more of it if we run out?
He said lil nigga today the poor is rich
Don't tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don't forget
Bitches ain't shit, hoes ain't neither
Niggas gon' snitch watch the company you keeping
And one day you'll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots
(That's right the mothafuckin' Rodney King
you just put your daddy on Bullis Rd.)

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (that's crazy)
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Don't forget still sing along kids, still sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (Please sing)
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah
