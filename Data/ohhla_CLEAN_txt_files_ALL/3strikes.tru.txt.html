[Master P]
Yeah an I'm here to see King George
Is y'all gonna let that fool outta jail

[Tobin Casten]
Sit down just for that I'm gonna give that nigga 20 to life
Burn nigga burn

[King George]
Chillin' in the courthouse stuck in jail
Time movin' slow, just like a snail
Hand-cuffed to the rail, delt a bad deal
Quiet in the court when the judge said bail
Caught up in the system can't get loose
Mow wear jump suit and black stained boots
25 went to hell, that's what I get
No I don't smoke but I can go for a cigarette
Another black man in the cell doing time
My name's on my chest number 6639
If I gotta die, King George ain't scared
With a bald head, I be better of dead

Chorus 4X

3 Strikes and they tryin' to give a nigga life
My man is still in jail

[King George]
Don't stress on me, keep the money on the book
Any fool cross me mother fucker gettin' took
It's all going down, blame it on the white man
Spike in my hand, King George with a chain gang
Moving right ahead you heard what I said
You not gettin' paid, you wondering why you dead
In your blue jeans , mother fucker wanna know how I get mine
Don't do the crime if you can't do the hard time
Strapped down through a T with a sharp knife
I never seen more niggas in my whole life

Chorus x4

[King George]
God damn, what they got you for man

[Master  p]
Aww man shit, burglary, armed robbery, 187
Fuck it aww, assault and battery on the police
You know what i'm sayin', man shit
Man this snitch got me right, this snitch ratted on me man
I was like on Cut Boulevard, this nigga named Roy he seen me
I had the dope you know what i'm sayin'
I took the dope from the bitch, then this white lady came
I hit her in her head, dropped the bitch in the car
Chopped her fingers off man then I fled up that
And they caught me up in East Oakland man
Man shit, I ain't trippin' though dogg
Shit i'm a soldier like you , see this blue arm band I got on
Nigga i'm on Santa Rita, i'm on the side with the killas
I'm Joseph Wilson nigga
I ain't here with them hoes or the rest of them old hoe ass niggas man
Shh shh be quiet man here come the captain here come the captain

[Tobin Casten]
Listen up, when I read your name off the list
You gonna know where you gonna be at in the morning
Robert Jordan, your going to the Pen. son
King George, your going up the river for a very long time
And Joseph Wilson, yeah man your going to traffic court son

[Master P]
Aww nah that ain't me man
Look, they got me confused, I'm going to the Pen.
Say King man I'm</pre>
