got some niggas that's gone dis the treal niggas on the tape 
but them the ones who want the streets so they start to evaporate 
that's why them niggas ain't around no more 
cause them niggas could sell no more 
without the Hypnotize or the Prophet nigga you is no more 
got plaques up on my walls 
got twenties on my cars 
keep coming like you coming and I'm gonna show you 
I ain't fucked up bout no charge nigga

{Juicy J}
can you niggas feel my pain 
catch me standing in the rain 
holding on a rusty 2 
bout to act a fuckin fool 
is the 6 the devil though 
make you wanna powder your nose 
have you smoking hydro weed 
satisfaction guaranteed 
bucking wild and throwing signs 
knowing these niggas done loss they minds 
blame it on Coriddy and Ooh 
when we cock them thangs and shoot 
thinking somebody had seen my face 
now I'm gonna catch a murder case 
just gonna beat him round for round and leave him in the river

{[DJ Paul] Crunchy Black}

{DJ Paul: talking}

Hypnotized C-A-M-motherfuckin-P bitch 
come on come on keep it coming keep it coming keep it coming

{Project Pat}
so you wanna try a 
nigga with the nine-a 
creep up from behind ya 
like the macarena 
shoot ya in your spine-a 
strap ya like a minor 
patch out your hizead 
slug bloody rized 
staying on the low low 
hating that's a no no 
duck taping trick up 
in the trunk you go go 
you gonna shake and shiver 
pain I deliver 
kidnapping fools throw they body in the river

{Koopsta Knicca}
let get this on 
you think I just piss off them fuckin sluts then a 
the streets auto traffic gonna fuck you up but now 
I had to tremble quick cause he bump with it 
got some midgets in my clizick now I'm pimping bitch 
my friends have brand new teams 
twenties hundred ain't she motherfuckin funny 
North Memphis come we catching everything and money 
home at night keep my motherfuckin eyes open 
cause last night I'm dealing with the fedz in the corner store

{Crunchy Black}
yo yo yo yo yo yo yo 
I locked em in the trunk 
and dropped they bodies off 
see cash in B.Z. you get that sawed off funk 
point to your head and then left someone dead 
then try that with thugs and be half out your head 
see messing with me is like messing with the fedz 
see messing with me is like being halfway dead 
most niggas don't walk my path I done already laid 
put 2 in the gun and flex so I won't be in that resting place 

{Lord Infamous}
don't make me get ignorant, feel the incisions 
I shall make fragments, daggerous dragon 
poison and lashes, 2000 hazardous 
can you imagine, me with the Magnum 
fire breathing dragon, blow away the ashes 
what the fuck happen, torture and trap them 
Satan is digging, Scarecrow premonition 
the world is ending, please make a decision  

{LaChat}
mayn fuck that shit 
go get that bitch and throw her ass in my trunk 
that infrared net be getting her head 
she make more sounds and she dumped 
where the fuck the evidence bitch 
only heat for my witness 
you think I'm playing what you saying 
LaChat ain't bout her business 
I tote my glock I keep it cocked 
the .38 slug for a nigga 
could be my brother husband cousin 
fuck him I pull the trigger 
got no remorse wont sympathize 
ain't got no love in my soul 
don't fuck with me know who I be 
LaChat that murdering hoe

{T-Rock}
I got him running from my slugs wrath 
niggas get they mugs snapped 
licking shots from plastic glocks 
you marinate in blood baths 
ignorance leave my manner 
silently concealed with Anna 
hoe I pugulize your skull 
and split it with the snipers scanner 
insert the capping glock 
gunpoint faster props 
lock and load like master lock 
and hit you for an aftershock 
I'm a snake so meet your fate 
compensate the paper chase 
Triple 6 is running shit 
corroborate and we make you wait 

{Lil Pat}
you's out there thinking we just bullshittin 
about this shit gone whined up being 
the very motherfucker with they wig split 
laying there in the corner 
that you cant just see me come out of 
now you think a nigga still playing 
bitch what's up cuz 
like I always said 
I'm gonna tell you once and ain't no more 
I think I done made it clear enough 
about how these ballers like the road 
I ain't you hoe 
Lil P don't mess with me when I get good and crunk 
or you gonna find yourself locked in the fuckin trunk
