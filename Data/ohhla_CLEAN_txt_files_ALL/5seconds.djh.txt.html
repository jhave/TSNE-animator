What? "I represent no question"
"Entire life's a record" - Redman from Dat's My Word  

Yo I get hooknotic (what?) I catch that prey on they victims
Big black I hi-tech shit like radar systems
Unsecessfully they try to get rid of me
Shit on me you must be kdding me
Thinkin' I'm a let that float (never) so it's time I severly touch this
track up
Back up cousin I'm about to twist this next sack up
For real tho' I bang like steel toed tims
Watch where you park at my man might steal your rims
We in the dark at all time of the night steady cheefin'
Rollin' with the illest of niggas so stop beefin'
Occassionly (what?) you might find me blazin' 
The rawest of MC's to spice you like Cajaun
Flow straight nasty like stank vagina
And I keep my shit pumpin' from Chile to China
Rewind it one time let me kick one more rhyme
One more time roll one more dime

Hook:
We keep it tight right plus we keep it poppin'
On top of that we hip hoppin' and don't stoppin'
"I represent no question" "Entire life's a record"

I'm cross country like Sony triple like Tony 
Get nasty like bologny, Ginuwine so ride the Pony
Uncomparable, noncompatable to your whole shit
You got it how can you tell to go get?
Cause lyrically I'll twist your shit back
Without no hesitation or the slightest bit of procrastination
I'll blast the nation on some Black Attack shit 
What nigga don't try and stop me
You need to hit up your local record shop and cop this bit
I know you're sick of those nonsense cat's kickin' wack raps
Talkin' about traps it's time to face the facts
Perhaps you're trying to get doe like Suge Knight
All the real niggas represent your hood right

Hook

Yo we keep it on some hip hop don't stop
I pops the cherry 
Added a new edition to my shit so you don't have to worry
Toss rhyme flurries
Hot to Def like Keith Murray
I'll bury your words and crush your thoughts in a hurry
Mutilate your mental have your whole style up 
First A and B reach your card out then I pull your file out
Stay on top of my game
Moves be stratigic 
Battlin' don't fuck around I'll leave you paraplegic
I mean it I give props to those who climb poetically
Not those who take it personal when I'm speakin' hypothetically
I'm just reppin', flowin' steadily
Unforgetable like Natalie
Son switch up so incredibly
So my joints be the total oppostie of gun clappin'
Just blunts and rappin'
Beat box and finger snappin'
Who put the DAT in? 
I let my nigga DJ Honda cut it up live 
Spark up the lye

Hook
