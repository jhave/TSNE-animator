Typed by: no1wammy@hotmail.com

[Frankie J.] Yay, yay
[LSR]        Happy Perez
[Frankie J.] So quick
[LSR]        LSR
[Both]       Welcome to the hot zone

Chorus: Frankie J.
DJ, turn it up
It's burnin' up
Turn it up, it's burnin' up
One time
So tight

[Verse 1: Nino Brown]
You like
Big bossin' at the Hot Z-O-N-E
Dollar bills, crispy
So much sweat
It smellin' fishy
But mess me with that
Who be the pimps and macks
Me and my cousin, dirty dozen, though he wasn't
With them creased up
Khakis suits
Stacee boots
With my troops like G's (What you think?)
Bitch, please
(???) on the rocks
Platinum pinky rings and watch (Presidential)
Show my credentials
Homie, keep that hoe in check
Chrome .44 on deck
Holmes, I bet
Don't make me do it
But ain't nobody gon' be trippin' tonight
Nino Beez and Bash, Frost
We straight flossin'
Motherfucker

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Frankie J. (LSR)
Welcome to the hot zone (Where you can dance, drink and smoke)
You can get your rocks on (And hustlers)
You can get your boss on (Where you can dance, drink and smoke)
Welcome to the hot zone (And hustlers)

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Frost]
You say
You got a hot spot, but dawg, it ain't the hot zone
This shit's vivid
This the life and how we kick it, bad bitches
Half-naked
Two at a time, at the drop of a dime
With the bottle of wine
The '68 in rewind
Take you back to the top, and then it's back
On the block, where we be keepin' it hot
You know the spot
Where the parkin' lot is smokin' up
Man, summer's on we
And summer's all coked up
Some come loc'ed up
Blaze the weed and choke up
Baby came horny
Her and a man just broke up
She wanna eat tab
She got dropped off in a cab, roll over
Big Frost, turnin' the world a little colder

Repeat Chorus, Hook &amp; Chorus

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
We bendin' corners
Tailgate straight to the fiasco
Got my wifey wonderin'
"Where the hell did Bash go?"
Man, I'm fat linin'
Like Joey Crack timin'
With a big booty beezy, backstage, freestylin'
Mean wildin'
It's crunker than crunk-da-dunk dunkuh
It's that head stunter, lookin' for a head hunter
And I guarantee these chickens start actin' right
Playboy T.B., filmin' platinum spice
And hey DJ, since you got 'em on boppin'
Could you give your boy a shot
What's pop lockin'
Choppers keep choppin', and them rollies, keep clockin'
And ain't nobody in the hot zone, cot blockin'
I'm off the Hennesey
She off the apple pucker
She lookin' so famous, she a bad motherfucker
And oh, hubba-hubba
She on the floor, groovin'
Baby Bash, LSR, we gon' keep the chains movin'

Repeat Chorus, Hook &amp; Chorus

[LSR {LSR slowed down}]
Come on
{So tight}
Come on
{Come on}
Yeah
Lone Star Ridaz
{LSR
