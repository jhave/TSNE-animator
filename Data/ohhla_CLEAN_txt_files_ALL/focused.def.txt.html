[Defari]
Sleep on the champ, man you better read the scouting report
You doubtin this so I connect wit Mr. Alchemist
The Soul Assassin straight blastin, bringin heat
You marvel at my connects wonderin why you can't compete
You're not competitive, you're more like a sedative
You put me to sleep wit each line, are you the bedtime kid?
Yet in still, I remain crisp like newly printed bills
And watch for those money-hungry Anita Hill's
Lyrics are effortless, no matter how stormy the weather gets
Those who know me like Kobe say "he's proliferate"
The gifted kid, focused like triangular pushups
Why you claim to be hard when you a buttercup?
I fuck shit up, stutter step wit action packed mag
Don't pull no crap just hit the track like a fullback
Lead block, don't mistake this for no pop-rap, pop
But that raw deal feel, that real hip-hop

Chorus 2x

Chorus
We straight serious in this
The thicker the weather gets, it's serious business
Focused Daily

[Evidence]
I'm twelve inches, get under skins like splinters
Watch my blind side, catch a elbow to the dentures
Never drop dimes, I'd rather save expenses
Evidence, I'm the intense, pressure makes key decisions
This track hits like Sonny Liston for the Alchemist
Will someone give me an award, illest vocalist
I'll come wack when LL loses the hat
Better yet, catch me wit Feds when Jordan grows dreds
I own scissors for clones, kill mics and mega-phones
Loud, be me or beat King Shamiq, and do it to the crowd
I throw bucks under Daly like Chuck
Always focused, Evidence yo here's a notice
Of eviction, time to leave the premises
This albums is incredible, less are arch-nemesis
I feel better cuz I spoke my peace
Bout to cop a twine sack and smoke that piece

Chorus 5x

[Defari]
My lyric-als unparall-el
You couldn't even catch a line if I called you on your chip (sup?)
*Ring* in your ear, crisp and clear
This nigga Defari's marvelous like Chinese New Year
Occasions, leavin brains battered, bruised, and blazin
A statesman, in the sun, Herut the L.A. shogun
Show some, show many, that lyrics are plated for
I'm here to last in the late night, more longer than Arsenio
Defari, diamond in the rough wit hot stuff
So many niggas claim that they focused, but that's a fuckin bluff
Or a lie, you can't lie to a man with a third eye
I'm in tune wit this shit, like when the birds fly
It's not enough to be focused just in the mind
Like the locust, I swarm physically plus mentally
Which means compeletely, I connect wit the drums
There's grown men here wit seriousness, this ain't no play for fun

Chorus 4x

We straight serious in this
"When I rock straight kids rejoice" [Guru]
Focused Daily
We straight serious in this
"When I rock straight kids rejoice"
Focused Daily
*Cut and scratched* "When I rock straight kids rejoice" "Defari" (6x)</pre>
