Yo, My morning showers like a rebirth; reflections of the womb
Crazy sentimental floatin' in lukewarm placental
Now I chop a burden on the sink trying not to think about what
Lies before me but the sun just reassured me that
Everythings gonna be allright, the last thing on my mind is tonight
Its like a sintch and getting Zestfully clean not to mention
Scrub my ass and armpits for a bit and then I split over to the mirror
Wipe the dew to make my vision clearer
Then I moisturize my face with some aloe Vera
This is that type of day cause I can feel it that
You ain't letting bad vibes invade your spirit
Anyway it's time to get the breath right
So I grab the Crest and toothbrush, circular motions to the left, right
Just enough to see the teeth sparkle a bit
I fill my grill with Listerine and then it's gargle, gargle, spit
And now that's good hygiene, you know what I mean?
And my mouths the definition of so fresh and so clean (clean)
I feel it's only right, since my words all I got
And nobody wants to listen when your breath is hot
But that's a story in itself so I head to my bedroom
Throw on some drawers and pick out a costume
I think ill rock these blue jeans and this tee shirt
And whats a little polo sport gonna hurt?
C'mon

This is that day cause I can feel it
You know the type of day you ain't lettin' bad vibes invade your spirit
As the birds chirp your favorite tune
It's like I'm right back in my momma's womb
Cause everything is so serine
And the temperature is just right
Not a worry in sight
And plus the sun is shining bright, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day

Shall I continue where I left off?
I'm feelin' kinda lovely but my
Tummy is growlin' so I'm feeling kinda hungry
So I hit the kitchen and I'm wishin' there's some food in sight
What do ya know? I got that Cinnamon Life
And now I'm real happy, fill my salad bowl up with cereal
To my surprise it's Jackson Five up on the stereo
I turn it up my words can't describe my reaction to
Wakin' up and listening to prepubescent Michael Jackson
Open up the Frigidair what do we have here?
Seems like just enough milk to fill my morning craving
Peep out the window just to see if Izzy is misbehaving
He's staring at me with a grin like 'Yo, let me in man!'
So I begin to fill his dish with Kibbles N' Bits
Let him in so he can eat, and I'm eating my shit
So now we both full and well fed
Happier than that fat rat Templeton from Charlotte's Web
And now its time to get our walk on
Izzy can get his bark on
It's a beautiful day maybe we'll get our state park on
I know the lake is at its finest (you better take afvantage)
I'll grab my backpack, this leash, and maybe make a sandwich
I better grab my ghetto blaster and a few tapes
A thurmos full of water and a bag of fresh grapes
Some more tapes cause you know that music comes first
And what's a little Jackson Five gonna hurt?
C'mon

This is that day cause I can feel it
You know the type of day you ain't lettin' bad vibes invade your spirit
As the birds chirp your favorite tune
It's like I'm right back in my momma's womb
Cause everything is so serine
And the temperature is just right
Not a worry in sight
And plus the sun is shining bright, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day

This is that day cause I can feel it
You know the type of day you ain't lettin' bad vibes invade your spirit
As the birds chirp your favorite tune
It's like I'm right back in my momma's womb
Cause everything is so serine
And the temperature is just right
Not a worry in sight
And plus the sun is shining bright, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day</pre>
