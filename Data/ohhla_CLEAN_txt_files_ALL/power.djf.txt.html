Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We have got the power

To go minute after minute
To go hour after hour
We can't get this party started
Until we have got the power

To go minute after minute
To go hour after hour
We can't get this party started
Until we have got the power

To go minute after minute
To go hour after hour
We can't get this party started
Until we have got the power

DJ Fresh
Dizzee Rascal

To go minute after minute
To go hour after hour
We can't get this party started
Until we have got the power

I wanna party 'til my last breath
'Til there ain't no air in my lungs left
I wanna party to death
In the club 'til I'm old like Hugh Heff
Switching other girls like "Who's next?"
Yeah

I get a rise, switch it up like brunette
Look at Michelle, Kerrie-Ann and Juliette
Do I get involved? Yeah I buss a lil' 2-step, you bet
I'm just gettin' started, I ain't through yet

I'm looking for a girl with a body like an hour glass
She can shake her body on my body while I tap arse
She ain't gotta be a high class, just a nice arse
I just wanna see her rock her hips around the beat fast

Now I need a top up, gimme something for my beer glass
I don't give a ras', anything to make the night last
Now I'm feeling high on my rocket, ain't no stopping when I fly past
Money in my pocket, you ain't gotta ask

How we feeling
Oh, ahh, yeah
Now everybody put your hands in the air
Clap those hands and sing it with me

To go minute after minute
To go hour after hour
We can't get this party started
Until we have got the power

To go minute after minute
To go hour after hour
We can't get this party started
Until we have got the power

To go minute after minute
To go hour after hour
We can't get this party started
Until we have got the power

To go minute after minute
To go hour after hour
We can't get this party started
Until we have got the power

Let's get it

Girls on the right, fellas on the left
Party 'til the death, party 'til your last breath
Finger in the air if you couldn't care less
We're gonna party all night, we don't want no rest

Fellas on the right, girls on the left
Party 'til the death, party 'til your last breath
Finger in the air if you couldn't care less
We're gonna party all night, everything will be fresh

We can't get this party started

To go minute after minute
To go hour after hour
We can't get this party started
Until we have got the power

To go minute after minute
To go hour after hour
We can't get this party started
Until we have got the power</pre>
