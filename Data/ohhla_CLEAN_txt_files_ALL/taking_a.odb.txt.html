[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
This is the cleanest bathroom I've ever seen
I'mma sit my shit down
Uhh, ahhh, ahhh, oh shit *fart* uhh hold on, I'm good
Take my shit, now, boy
Nigga gotta shit! Nigga gotta shit!
Ain't nothing wrong!
What? What, wash the toilet bowl?
That look clean to me
Ahh, shit -- shit, lord
Oh... damn... ahh, ahh, fuck, man
Drinking too much of that damn wood, everytime
Shit... mmm rush no shit...
Ugh... ahh, damn... wipe my ass
I don't know why they don't just put one of them
protective covers over the seat
Fuck I might catch some shit up in my ass
