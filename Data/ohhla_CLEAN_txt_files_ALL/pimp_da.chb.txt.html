[Charli - Intro]
Yo, yo

Suave House, what (pimp da one you love)

This for all my ladies yo
All my ladies that are pimps

Yo

[Charli]
From the intro, nigga had me hooked like indoe
Shoulda kept my shit tight like homes with no windows
But women knows
Ballers, be sayin' that right shit
On some layin' that pipe-shit
But me, got right quick
Open, still kept my feelings tight-lipped
Trippin', all game was slippin'
Off the hyped bit, always been the tight bitch
Keep these cats in line, pay that rent on time
And we'll talk about extra keys to my spot
When it's extra V's in my lot, extra G's in my knots
So how I managed to get damaged on 'chill with one nigga' shit
I was to break me off with some more figures bitch
I don't know, just caught me at the right moment
Vulnerable, nigga jumped up on it
With mind games, took me out of my frame
I ain't even want his payback, my homey Tony Drapper
He pimped for the guts and I was givin' 'em up
Can't tell me I can't have any player I want
And I burnt myself out tryin' to turn his ass out
All he wanted was a fling and no strings
Slayin' me, on some less weighin' fee
One-half of his shit
But when it blew up, I said fuck this rappin' shit
Been sheisty all my life, and it came back
It happens when your minds attached to your perfect match

[Eightball] (Rodney)
Charli Baltimore put it in they face (pimpin' ain't easy)
Let 'em know that pimpin' ain't easy
Pimp ladies and pimp fellas (pimpin' ain't easy)
Gotta get the dough, no time for the jealous

Charli Baltimore put it in they face (pimpin' ain't easy)
Let 'em know baby, pimpin' ain't easy
Pimp ladies and pimp fellas (pimpin' ain't easy)
Gotta get the dough, yeah
Pimp da one you love

[Charli]
Yo, so what now?, after all this time has past
Just to find out, all along, it was just a gas
I asked my best friend, my dog for advice that got me
And I was twisted, haters got me
Yeah, no doubt, it's a nigga and shit
He was trippin' off the way I was OP off the trick
He said, "Yo, you can scoop any nigga you wish"
Just seperate the dick from your mind and shit
Make that punk recognize how your time was spent
How your time was lent, not how your mind was bent
Get yourself back from that cat
And rise above, only way to pimp
Is to pimp the one you love
Wise words, my dog got me trained right
Game tight, had to stay strong and to stay tight
Stay nights, with my doggie
Knew he had my back till the day I made eye contact
With my old boo, best friends, remember what I told you
Pimpin' ain't easy, gotta play sleazy
Went to his house, put it on him and bounced
Fucked him with my eyes open, got him groppin'
Tables turned, nigga stressed, nigga guessed
He could play a player
But I got schooled and fooled him
Ladies let me tell you how you get it and win
First shit on him and then say forget it on him, yeah

[Charli - Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'?
All these niggas go around talkin' bout they pimps
Ladies' is pimps, knwhatImsayin''?
We know how to get to niggas minds
With the pussy and then get they minds yo
It's a mind thing, you know what I mean?
Niggas runnin' around on some bullshit
Ladies is takin' over
Gettin' these niggas fucked up, yo
I'm tellin' you
The only way a lady can become a pimp
Is to start with that nigga that is always under you, yo
Pimp dat nigga
Make that nigga work for your ass
Yeah, yeah
This is the words of Charli Baltimore, 98 shit
You know what I'm sayin'?
