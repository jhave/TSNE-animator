[Frank Ocean]
I just wanna make love {*3X*}
Play a couple chords, jump on board
If you wanna ride out (if you wanna ride out)
Imma hit a few keys bring you down to your knees
So you don't wanna leave now (don't wanna leave)
I got you up in my house now (ow)
Fix you up another Mai Thai (Thai)
No sun on the horizon (on)
Let's make a song for the night time (time)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano

[Frank Ocean]
Stroke of harmony kiss you on your neck
I'm changin up your voice sound (changin up your sound)
I'ma do what I said and take you to the bridge
and make you climax now (ahh ahh)
Now we switching up the melody (ay~!)
We take it down to a minor stage (stage)
We making noise like we can't believe (ay)
Let's put this moment on replay

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
Oooooh
Girl what'cha you wanna - dooo
Back it up, back it up, back it up up up {*2X*}
I think I got a cluuue
Girl whatcha you wanna doooooo
You wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano

[Chorus]
