(chorus)
You can have a good time anytime that you wanna have a good time
You can have a good time anytime that you wanna have a good time
You can have a good time anytime that you wanna have a good time
You can have a good time anytime that you wanna have a good time
You can have a good time anytime that you wanna have a good time
You can have a good time

(verse 1)
It's Saturday night, I'm on the usual standing in the long line
Waiting for my hand to be stamped so I can get mine
It's never me and who, it's always the same crew
Me with a few ends rollin' with a few friends
Fake smiles, yeah we got 'em in the pocket books
For all them frontin' niggas with the rented cars that wanna look
Music blastin' in the cars while they passin'
Mini skirts high, hoping we can catch an eye
To get a duplicate number from the last week
You rap outside but inside the club you can't speak
Talkin' bout yeah, you wanna keep it real on the phone
But got me on the list just to bone
I don't think so, let me mingle, cause I'm single
Movin' to the next man, with a drink in my hand
It's all about a good time on the weekend
Party on the Sunday when you should be sleeping

(chorus)

(verse 2)
Gin, juice and tonics, stereophonics got me open
Swayin' up the crowd make you wanna go wild so high
Can't stop Cause you feel good
When you brushin' thighs catchin' eyes off the guys when you walk by
It's Saturday night, now can you see this
And if it wasn't packed in the club it wouldn't be this good
All the fellas from the hood
Be givin' out your number all night if you could
Relaxing, no pistol packin', now what's this feelin'
Temperature's risin', bass lines through the cieling
Time to get a drink, I think champagne will do
Pass a glass to me, and slide four bottles to my crew
Why I thought you knew, that Nonchalant will make you feel right
It's past midnight, and this funk's tight
It's all about a good time on the weekend
Party on the Sunday when you should be sleeping

(chorus)

(verse 3)
&gt;From inside to outside, fellas on the slow ride
Creepin' while they peepin' out the jeep an' damn
Yeah I feel like swayin',
And if you ever fronted all night yeah you know what I'm saying
But oh, what I'm feeling, and you know I'm willing
To give it to you like it is so you know you're dealing
With the true one, big fun, hell I 'fess
If I roll past you're house then you're best to get dressed
While I'm sippin', still trippin' off the last week
Honeyz makin' moves but they still can't catch me
Cause I'm swervin', been in ever curve an'
Checkin' out the scenen so I'm just observing
&gt;From a 8-50, ladies are you wit' me
And if you want's to roll, holler, can you come get me
Cause it ain't no joke when we creepin'
Yeah, just party on the Sunday when you should be sleeping

(chorus)
