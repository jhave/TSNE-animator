If you are offended.. by words..
If you are offended.. by, by words, by words..
If you are offended.. by, by word-words..

[Devin]
Don't come talkin that "shit", if your freak is a "bitch"
She's real easy to "fuck", she even sucked my "dick"
After I bust that "ass", didn't think of her as a "ho"
But she know after I "cum", then I gots ta go
That's enough for me she almost hurt my dick
And you gotta come home to this "dirty bitch"
She's a funky cock, "low mother-fuck-fucker"
And I'm a "nigga", who'll treat any hussy just like a "hooker"
But a ho is not a "slut", and a bitch is not a "tramp"
But what I like about 'em both is that they pussy get damp
And a "nigga" can "fuck" "shit" up, if they don't know
that a "dirty low slut", is a "tramp bitch ho"
Whatever!
Whatever!</pre>
