* [DJ Clue] &amp; (Busta Rhymes)
Yeah DJ Clue (Yeah)
Desert Storm (Yeah) Fabolous (Flipmode)
With Wilma M. Holla (Busta Bus alright)

* [Busta Rhymes]
Pay attention (Oh oh oh)
Let's all form a line and focus (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ha ha (Fabolous: I'm trying to save your life)

* [Fabolous] (with Busta Rhymes &amp; DJ Clue ad-libs throughout)
We can do it in the mix
I'll even raise the privacy shade if we do it in the six
Everything his and hers
I know you like sipping K, moving until your vision blurs
Exquisite furs, this preferred
You even got a set of keys to the Spiz in Jers
Get your man that ain't promise
I'm the kid that'll make sure you keep that tan from St. Thomas
It's no trouble at all
So you can imagine after I go double this fall
Most this player can do is retire
I know Gucci's newest attire
And shoes is required
I don't care who was your priors
Any man saying he don't want you is a liar
All they can do is admire
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S I do this Mariah

* [Mariah Carey] &amp; (Busta Rhymes)
Last night a DJ saved my life (Come on, ha ha)
Last night a DJ saved my life yeah
Cause I was sitting there bored to death
And in just one breath (Come on)
He said you gotta get up (Gotta get up, gotta get up)
(Yeah, just bounce around)
(Just shake that shit and bounce around)
You gotta get on
You gotta get down girl
You know you drive me crazy baby (M.C. Wilma)
Turning to another man (Talk to him Wilma, talk to him Wilma)
Called you on the phone
No one's home (Yeah, yeah)
(Just shake and bounce around, come on)
Baby why you leave me all alone
(Just bounce around, yeah)
(Just bounce around)
(Just shake that shit and bounce around)
And if it wasn't for the music
I don't know what I'd do
(What cha' gonna do talk to me and let me see it baby)
(Come talk to me, ha, come talk to me)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey &amp; Busta Rhymes]
Last night a DJ saved my life ooh
(Ha, shake that shit and bounce around)
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart (One time now)
Last night a DJ saved my life
(Yeah, where we going now, come touch me girl yeah, yeah, yeah)
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song

* [Busta Rhymes] &amp; (DJ Clue)
Yeah, yeah here we go now come on
Shake that thing and come give it to me (DJ Clue!) come on
(Fabolous!) shake that thing and come give it to me (Busta Rhymes!)
Come on, put your hands where my eyes can see (M.C.!)
Come on, shake that thing and come give it to me, come on (Come on!)

Mariah Carey &amp; (Busta Rhymes):
You know I hopped into my car
Didn't get very far, no
Because I had you on my mind
Why be so unkind
(Yeah, yeah talk to me my, Wilma where you at, come talk to me come on)
You've got your women all around
All around this town, boy
(Ha ha, yeah just shake and bounce around)
(Come on, yeah just bounce around come on)
But I was trapped in love with you
And I didn't know what to do
(Yeah, yeah pass that thing steaming over there)
(And give me that bottle of that Henny over there)
But when I turned on the radio
I found out all that I needed to know
(Just shake and bounce around come on, yeah) Check it out
(Just bounce around, come on)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey &amp; Busta Rhymes]
Last night a DJ saved my life
(What cha' want now, what cha' want now)
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart, from a broken heart
(From a broken heart, come on)
Last night a DJ saved my life, last night
(What cha' want now, what cha' want now)
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song
(Put your hands up high for me, come on)
Last night a DJ saved my life
(What cha' want now, what cha' want now)
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart (DJ Clue, M.C.!)
(Put your hands up high for me, come on)
Last night a DJ saved my life
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song, with a song
