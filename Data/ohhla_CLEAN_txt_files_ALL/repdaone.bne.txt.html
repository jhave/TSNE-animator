Ohh we represent the one, we represent the one
We are the soldiers, we are the soldiers cuz, c'mon feel me
Soldiers soldiers, represent the one, we represent the one
We are the soldiers soldiers, ohh we represent the one
 
Under surveillance, am I paranoid?
Never, I never need duckin the enemy off in evil territory
So why they comin off to bust on me
I got my homie out of the way, I think my lady got a crush on me
Somebody put the finger hush on me
Never put a plug in me, I'ma shake that dust off me
I got some mush on me, that was just that lust on me
But if you're, lovin me it's just a, plus on me
I'm tellin 'em only God judges me, Jesus Christ the savior
Bow down to the Lord, blow the trumpet on 'em major
Me no need no cell phone, me no need no pager
But we got some rules we gotta follow in the course of danger
But me no sign nothing unless it feel righteous
That's right just no pressure, play 'em, enlighten 'em
I'd rather have a palm tree, and a Long Island iced tea
And everyone can be happy and then, heheh
 
We are the solders soldiers
Ohh we represent the one, we represent the one
We are the soldiers soldiers
And tell 'em the war has just begun
The war has just begun! Soldiers soldiers
Represent the one, we represent the one
We are the soldiers...
 
Gather the peak, little children are caught
Need to be reared out quickly, comin out to the storm
And it's quickly I spit war, gettin it calm now
Spittin it war now, you ain't even seen no wild child
Get 'em up from the free seagull and fowl
And the flocks of birds of foul, I see 'em flyin around
And of course they take the wide path, homicide
Now who the motherfuckin soldier with the stubble now?
With the crowns now, beatin 'em down, baby we gonna
And when we come around, we never gonna be beat
We deep in the streets, and Heavenly with the one
Yes we represent it, and the war has just begun
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit c'mon
Changin the righteous, lightning quick yan
Yeah, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, heh
Changin the righteous lightning quick yan
We are the soldiers, we represent the one
Praise God, holla back, one</pre>
