Lil' Flip always smokin' that la la la
Will Lean always smokin' that la la la
Play-hef always smokin' that la la la
It's Clover G's and you know my lullaby, come on
Excuse me bitch, you know I'm rich
So don't snitch about how I hustle
Cause I got muscle, skip all that shit
Just gimme a brick bitch

[Will Lean]
I'm a gangsta, it ain't love at first sight
You's a freak so we fucked the first night
I'm in the back seat puffin' that la la la
Me and my niggaz gettin' high high high
You better ask around, that I smokes a pound
Four four desert eagle what I tote around
Nigga, in that Coup de Ville
Hit ya wit the steel nigga let loose ya grill
You choose to squeal, it's the truth I kill
With that infra red beam let loose ya grill nigga
Uh, and I take ya head off when I grab my shit
And start lettin' this lead off

[Hook]

Yeh, you know how we do it man
If you in ya motherfuckin' car
Cut this shit up nigga (cut it up)

[Lil' Flip]
Yeh, we got the dro fire it up
You want me to do it show you gotta wire it up
Go to Western Union and call me back
Gimme the tracking number nigga and I can do that
I need the dro nigga top of the line
You got clothes in yo closet but they not like mine
You got hoes in yo camp but they can't flow like us
You got weed in yo yard but it don't grow like us
Inhale exhale, Sprints and Nextels
Gotta write letters to my niggaz that's in jail (keep ya head up)
Locked up they baby momma knocked up
If niggaz play wid my money my guns get cocked up
I franchise like a Houston Rocket
Every eight months is when I usually drop it
Every eight blunts is when I usually stop it
Every eight glocks is when I usually pop it

[Hook]

[Play]
Ain't wid that huggin' and kissin' and lovin', bitch
I'm wid that smokin' and drinkin'
Cause I gotta keep it thuggin
And I'm bumpin' and grindin'
Got to put the snake to bite
R kel's I'm up all night put up a good fight
If you gon' jack somethin' make sure ya jack good
Cause if not, then I pop and I go get my guns
I rap for Clover G's and I rap for P-T-P
I rap for all them gangstas out there gettin' they cheese
I Double XL or Source to make bread
I need pots a few bricks to go slice my bread
Me Flip and Will will flip and lean on you
Take ya truck that's not ya rap and fuck a rap
After Lil' Flip album ya ass is crap
You know me Play-hef and the tracks we lacin'
Smokin' on that bubble that sticky Canadian bacon
Fuck a lil hand stamp that shit
