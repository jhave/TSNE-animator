[Ron Brownz: Intro]
Pop champagne, Ohh, We Pop champagne (Hey)
Pop champagne, Ohh, We Pop champagne

[Ron Browz]
Haha
Stuntin out of control, that's how it's goin down
Cage and Luda, Big Ups to Ron Browz
At the pool party chillin, she takin off their towelz
1 booty, 2 booty, 3 booty... POW!
And it's about to get wild, hot tub chillin with bubbles and crystal
About to do it kinky, manage with two girls
Double up a chocolate caramel swirl
Ooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Hot 16, you can tell I'm a freak
I'm a big boy girl, you can tell I like to eat
This is a grown man's game, lil boy go to sleep
But don't trip shawty, I'm so so street
Not the ordinary ordinary I.N.D
Just like I like to keep a flock of them dimes around me
I keep the four pound ready, hit them goons on speed
Na, Na, Na, Na, that's a hot 16
I only did 12 but that's a hot 16
Give me the corkscrew baby I'm a pop champagne
Na, Na, Na, Na, now that's a hot 16
Luda, Luda, Luda

[Ludacris]
Hot 16, They call me hot 16, I'm Mr. Hot 16
LUDA, Give you a hot 16
I made the Forbes list, Yeah I know you seen it
8 figures so if I say it you know I mean it
Every verse is fishscale, I triple beam it
Then I freeze my hand up and pinkie ring it
When from nobody on the block to super stardom
Now I got women in Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx and Harlem
Hit me crib on the Hudson, only if you worthy
I put 3 on their backs like an Iverson jersey, LUDA! haha
I Pop champagne, girl I really love it how you pop that thang
Tell the DJ to never stop that thang
So you can back it up and just drop that thang
Rock that thang, lock that thang
And not even Patrick Willis can block that thang
Got my balls on my back when I cop that thang
Take ya to home base and sock that thang
And that's my hot 16, they call me hot 16 (Hey) 
I'm mr hot 16 (Haa), give you a hot 16 (Ha)
My hot 16, (Hey) I'm mr hot 16 (Oh!)
Give you a hot 16, LUDA, that's your hot 16

[Jim Jones] (*Ron Browz)
When I go to the dealer you know I cop that (What's that)
Brand new 'rarri and the roof drop back (360)
Came thru Harlem like the rooftop back (Ayo)
Money In the bank man you know I stop that (Stop that, stop that, stop that) 
(*Ohhh) Now we tryin to get up in the club 
(*Ohhh) Tryin to tell me no because I'm rollin with the thugs (Got money bitch)
So I flash a couple of dollas, tell dem we only want tables and we buyin out the bottles
(*Ohhh) But ya'll know the order, tell dem ten Rose's and a few cold waters (Right)
Trolly tron and a couple of lemons (Let's Go)
Ten thousand dollars stuffed up in the denims (What else)
Standin on couchs, couple of women (Hey Baby) 
We was ballin' hard and it was just the ninth inning (It's early)
I told shawty we can be friends (Yup), your friends can meet my friends (What else)
We can do this on a weekend or a week day (Oh)
We can do this on the freeway, get it in the freak way, shit you can get it all three ways
Blackberry two ways, souped up cars on the thru way
We superstars no Lupe, we can do this on the duet (Oh)
Ya'll be the singers on the mic, let me dim the lights
This was in the car when I was stoppin at the light

[Ron Browz: Chorus]
Pop champagne, Ohh, We Pop champagne (Hey)
Pop champagne, Ohh, We Pop champagne
Pop champagne, Ohh, We Pop champagne (Hey)
Pop champagne, Ohh, We Pop champagne

[Juelz Santana]
Baby I wanna see you work, see you dance
Without no shirt, without those pants
Pop champagne ain't a damn thang change
Spread it in the air, make the champagne rain
Buckets of ice keep the champagne cool
Mami got a body see that damn thang mova
It's no sex in the champgane room
Says who? Baby I brake all rules (Yeah)
Bring it her and I'll brake off you
She see me in VIP wanna brake on thru (Face it)
When see with you, she bet she fake it
When see me with me, she like it she never fake it

[Ron Browz: Outro]
