[Fingazz]
If you think your hard motherfucker
We quick to pull your card motherfucker
So watch your back
Real gangstas smash
We be coming your ya

[Mr. Shadow - talking]
Yeah, yeah, watch your back
Shit, Shadow, Lil One
Finga Delicate, E-Dub, ha
Watch your back haha yeah

[Mr. Shadow]
Shadow's back with a whole new stack
Of that bomb ass shit that makes haters have fits
So shut the fuck up or end up in the trunk
You little bitch, kan't nothin come close
You all know it's untouchable
I won't send you home, I'll send your ass to the hospital
So now you know, Know WHAT? Shad and Uno
Rock shit and cock shit and unload
Hit chu hard on freeze mode
Real g's unscroll straight out of Diego
Southern Cal, Doing WHAT? in your mouth
So take notes boy

[Chorus]
If you think your hard motherfucker
We quick to pull your card motherfucker
So watch your back, real gangstas smash
We be comin for ya
If you think your hard motherfucker
We quick to pull your card motherfucker
So watch your back, real gangstas smash

[Mr. Lil One]
Back the fuck up, who is it, see me comin' and reveal you
It's the Reaper on your hood, I don't feel you
I see through you, kinda like stanks said
See me playin' dead leave that ass brain dead
Where the game went? I don't really know dawg
You the hog in the mob and all, Hm-mmm
Executed like the card and all
Ugh damn, who really be the man
Understand that the plan that I view is crucial
Living by the knife, and my life is the usual
That's how we live, take this shank to the rib
And peace the dead that be dwelling where I live

[Chorus]
If you think your hard motherfucker
We quick to pull your card motherfucker
So watch your back, real gangstas smash
We be comin for ya
If you think your hard motherfucker
We quick to pull your card motherfucker
So watch your back, real gangstas smash

[Mr. Shadow]
I'll make the hardest move you know turn softer than a pillow
Best thing to do, don't get caught in the middle
Why? the sicko click, WHAT? don't say shit
They just coolin' pimpin'
Step in you guppies, it's better if you don't trust me
You might hate me, but your girl and your kids love me
Life's a bitch, and then WHAT? then you die
That's on the real homie
You don't know me and I like it like that
A Name You Kan't Touch, you got a problem with that
Now mind your own, If WHAT? if you want to live long
That's how it goes hater

[Chorus]
If you think your hard motherfucker
We quick to pull your card motherfucker
So watch your back, real gangstas smash
We be comin for ya
If you think your hard motherfucker
We quick to pull your card motherfucker
So watch your back, real gangstas smash
We be comin for ya
We be comin for ya
We be comin for ya</pre>
