[Fatt Father]
Yo FK doe, let me get at you man. (Well who are you?)
It's Fatt Father, the invisible man
Known to enter the scene without being scene
Make you drop your chicken wings, giggle pick up 'em and leave
Skinny people mad, I stick 'em and I flee
The only thing they got for cops is "I heard that nigga breathe!"
Because I stall like I'mma sleep when I walk
Take from all the rich folks and give to the poor
A Fatt individual on which you can't get a visual
Come to your crib, get in and diminish you
They say my Father was nothing, we identical
Don't get caught, or be stomped with your own tennis shoes
You can't grab what you can't see
So when he grabs you in mid air, bow down and thank me
Bastard of the D like (?) to (?)
You saw what? Ahha, it ain't me!

[Chorus - King Gordy]
Here we come to save the day
FK. FK. FK
Fat-tastic 4
Here we come to save the day. (Start the riot)
FK. FK. FK
Fat-tastic 4

[Shim-E Bango]
They call on the Fat-tastic when things get drastic
I'm in your park swooping up your picnic basket
I give my arm a stretch. That a way
With the talent to tap ass from a block away
For all y'all criminals who lack the minerals
You're crew will get wet like my breakfast cereal
I'll shift my shape. My shape'll shift
Till you be like "Damn, what shape is this?"
I rock a lab coat and some crispy Air Ones
You thug will get plugged
Go head and flare guns
Bullets'll bounce off me
Go head try it
the Fat 4 got your whole crew quiet
(When it's a riot) I grab villain by the throat
like Spreewel, but don't release 'em till his necks broke
I mean hell, people are pissed the can't grab me
Suck in, puffin the wind like Trick Daddy

[Chorus - King Gordy]
Here we come to save the day
FK. FK. FK
Fat-tastic 4
Here we come to save the day. (Start the riot)
FK. FK. FK
Fat-tastic 4

[Marvwon]
Testin us when your crew done lost. (Who are you?)
It's Marv Wonder for the human torch
I'm burning wack rappers in the blink of an eye
They ain't been misled (but somehow, I don't think they can die)
Y'all employ guns, I retire heaters
I'm born to a full black girl and a fire breather
Give me five lighters, I can turn to a fifth
that'll punch your ass in the mouth (and leave you burned to a crisp)
When I spit its arson, they be hopin I quit
I burn writers and turn ciphers into bits
And then I love barbecue. You wanna start with who?
Ain't too many alive that can do what Marvin do
You trynna douse me? Bring whoever you got man
It runs in the family, my little brothers the hot man
So if you desire beef
When I scorch you, no police, caught on fire, g
I'm Fat-tastic

[Chorus - King Gordy]
Here we come to save the day
FK. FK. FK
Fat-tastic 4
Here we come to save the day. (Start the riot)
FK. FK. FK
Fat-tastic 4

[King Gordy]
Here comes the thing. With them two braids
He's always gettin high, drinkin a cup of Kool Aid
He listens to rock and roll and moshpits with white people
He wont get off of your soul, believe me, he's quite evil
You ain't heard none nicer. Will be absurd price for
Rimy, Kristyle, but for now get him Budweiser
In the club I'm rubbin heineys, bussin, they love it
then plug her with something that make her wanna run for her husbands
I break up homes. (What?)
Just cause I'm fat, funny looking you dont think that I can take your hoe?
I was made for drama, don't get crazy dog
Cause you caught my chillin on 32 inches parkin lot pimpin your baby momma
Gordy came out of a comic, take one look and you'll vomit
I'm comin hard than comets, bomibin your continent
FK got a lot of hits, they so appealin
Prepare to have you knees ate with corduroy fillin

[Chorus - King Gordy]
Here we come to save the day
FK. FK. FK
Fat-tastic 4
Here we come to save the day. (Start the riot)
FK. FK. FK
