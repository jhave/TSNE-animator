[Intro]
No surrender, right back at your monkey ass with
Krayzie Bone, Damon Sharpe
Is it me? (yeah)

[Chorus] (Krayzie Bone, Damon Sharpe)
Is it me? (Really) 
Is it me? (Really)
Could it be the way I kick my game? (I slang my thang)
Could it just be the money and my fame
(My money got your vision blurry, you don't see me)

Is it me? (Really) 
Is it me? (Really)
Could it be the way my Rolly blings (Bling, bling)
Could it just be the finer things you see (My money
got vision blurry, you don't see me)

[Krayzie Bone]
We in the club, and everybody showin' love
And I think that's because they recognize a thug
So there I was, mindin' my business chillin', doin' my thing
And I'm tryna drink, but some of my partners celebratin' the game, we came up
Pop the top off the bottle, light up the Hydro
Now I'm bakin', I'm ridin' home with me a fly ho
As a thought was  rushin' through my mind, she caught my eye
So fine, I'm thinkin' "Yeah she can ride 'The Line'"
She saw me lookin' at her 
She tried to stand up, tryna let a nigga know she got big titties and butt
But I just analyzed the whole thing 
She was starin' at my necklace and my rings, but it wasn't me

[Chorus]

[Damon Sharpe]
You try to hide, you try to cover up the lies
But I can see the dollar signs shinning in your eyes
(Ching, ching, ching)
Can't play me for a fool 
Here's a dub now give it up and...
(Drop, drop, drop it like it's hot) 

[Krayzie]
Since you think your so slick

[Damon]
Baby I feel you

[Krayzie]
Think your so independent

[Damon]
I like that in you

[Krayzie]
Well baby you can pay your own rent, and your
telephone bills, bills, bills, bills

[Damon]
Baby is it me?

[Chorus]

[Krayzie]
My money, you want it?

[Damon]
And you're never gonna get it

[Krayzie]
My jewelry, you want it?

[Damon]
You're never gonna get it

[Krayzie]
My Benz, you want it?

[Damon]
You're never gonna get it

[Krayzie] 
You better come up on it

[Damon]
You'll never, get it

[Krayzie]
I'm krayzie, but I am krayzie
So you can take that lame shhh 

[Damon]
Baby is it me your really seeing

[Chorus]

Right back at your monkey ass</pre>
