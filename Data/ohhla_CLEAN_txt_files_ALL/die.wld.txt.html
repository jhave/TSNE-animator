[Intro: Excerpt sampled from 'My Alibi']
Die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die!
Die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die!
Die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die!
Die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die! ----&gt; Willie D

[Verse One: Willie D]
Cause I'm sick of the weak-ass shit you've been saying
I'm sick of the weak-ass shit you've been playing
Make me wanna shoot my radio out
But I won't do such, because it costs too much
But I will do, is give you something brand new
For the DJ's, emcees and fans too
Some say I'm not mobbing
But look around, count how many heads are bobbing

[Chorus]
Die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die! ----&gt; Willie D
All I have in this world ----------&gt; Al Pacino as Tony Montana
Die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die! ----&gt; Willie D
All I have in this world ----------&gt; Al Pacino as Tony Montana
Die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die! ----&gt; Willie D
All I have in this world ----------&gt; Al Pacino as Tony Montana
Die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die! ----&gt; Willie D
All I have in this world ----------&gt; Al Pacino as Tony Montana

[Verse Two: Willie D]
I've heard your new song on the radio
Hated that shit, cause it sounded like a demo
Now if you're so pro back, punk bitch
Stop getting them white boys to mix your shit
You get a nigga like Crazy C
And your shit won't sound so sloppy
I know, you hate what I said
But if you run up, I'll put a gun upside your fucking head
Cause homeboy, I don't love you
You get your mama, or somebody else to feel sorry for you
Put your rhymes in a casket, bigger bed
Bury your heads, cause that shit is dead
I needed something that was holding
So I've called New Orleans, and caught up with Rollin
He said he had a boy who can play the piano
His name was Gold Finger, so this ain't a sample
Big Loc made the bass-line groove
He got paid, to sign with Stick-N-Move
So you better find some new ideas
And stay the fuck away from here

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Willie D]
Now, tell your so-cold super dope producers
You need to stop fucking with losers
And get yourself some juice
Call yourself a producer but ain't never produced (All I have in this world)
Saw you stepping like a penguin, this ain't Ringling
So you and your crew, can suck a mean one
Old School beats get ruined
Cause motherfuckers like you be putting weak-ass rhymes to them
I can't help, cause your bass don't boom
Your drums don't kick, and your horns are out of tune
Make a nigga just loose respect
Pushed out eject and snatched your shit out the tape deck
Cause your lyrics are way out
You should've stayed out, four tracks done played out
Your production is booty bro, save enough money
So you can work out of the studio, then practice on your vocals
And stop acting like you're universal, when you're local
So take your whack-ass style, your whack-ass songs
Your whack-ass girl and take your whack-ass home

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Willie D]
Yeah, this goes out to all you wanna be, ain't never gonna be shit
Rappers on a local scene acting like you're all that
Jealous-ass, ain't paid no motherfucking dues
Ain't sold no motherfucking records (All I have in this world)
But run around with T-Shirts with your name on
Yeah, you whores don't try to be friend with a nigga
Cause that big shit will get your wig splits

All I have in this world ----------&gt; Al Pacino as Tony Montana
All I have in this world ----------&gt; Al Pacino as Tony Montana

[Chorus]

[Excerpt sampled from 'My Alibi']
Die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die!
Die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die!
Die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die! ----&gt; Willie D

[Outro: Overvoice]
Haaaayyyy, turn that shit down!</pre>
