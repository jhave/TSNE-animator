Uh
I overheard talk is cheap (Uh huh)
Anyway that's the word on the street (that's right)
I don't talk if I'm forced to speak (Uh uh)
I speak the truth cause the world is listenin'

Mama told me there'd be days like these
I prepared for the worst, yeah it hurts
Cause my biological didn't bother
But what my godfather told me always made me go harder
My brothers told me if I don't fight 'em back
He gon' fuck me up, and I don't want that
Enrique say he give me 50 every reup
Put the drugs in the sneakers said take 'em to Maria

I overheard that talk is cheap (Uh huh)
Anyway that's the word on the street (that's right)
I don't talk if I'm forced to speak (Uh uh)
I speak the truth cause the world is listenin'

Lil' man only 4 but he listenin'
Quiet girl don't talk but she listenin'
I speak the truth cause the world is listenin'
(Listen to this, just listen to this)

Ms. Beckham told me that the world is mine
The bully at lunchtime said what's yours is mine
A tragic effect, I went and bought the nine
And reverse the outcome went extort his shines
Cutie told me no, it made me sour
Scarface told me, get the money, and the power
Then you get the chicks, I said OK
Called Enrique, hit the block with nicks

I overheard that talk is cheap (Uh huh)
Well anyway that's the word on the street (that's right)
I don't talk if I'm forced to speak (Uh uh)
I speak the truth cause you never know who listenin'

I was told my neighbor was a serial killer
3 bodies, 2 attempts, we cool, that's my nigga
Moms boyfriend was a violent offender
He said he never hit her, nigga lyin', I remember
How could you hurt somethin' precious and tender?
Protective it made me, my sisters husbands hate me
Niggas told me I'm the greatest alive
And I believe 'em and I don't need a reason

I overheard that talk is cheap (Uh huh)
Well anyway that's the word on the street (that's right)
I don't talk if I'm forced to speak (Uh uh)
I speak the truth cause you never know who's listenin'

Lil' nigga got a gun and he's listenin
And she's out to have fun and she listenin'
I speak the truth cause the world is listenin'
(Listen to this, just listen to this)

My little brother told me I'm a father figure
That made me mature now I want it even more
My sister put me on told me what the girls want
If I don't tell my friends I'll be the one the girls want
Mr. Eaton said I wouldn't be shit
Of course I didn't listen, I just kept writin'
But wound up in prison, he musta been right then
Nope! My aunt told me there's no one like me

I overheard talk is cheap (Uh huh)
Well anyway that's the word on the street (that's right)
I don't talk if I'm forced to speak (Uh uh)
I speak the truth cause the world is listenin'

Lil' homies on the corners yeah they listenin
She very curious and she listenin'
I speak the truth cause the world is listenin'
(Listen to this, just listen to this)</pre>
