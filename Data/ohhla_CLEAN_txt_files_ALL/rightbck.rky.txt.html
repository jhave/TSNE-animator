Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Yeah, this is for my niggas, my real niggas
Hood gossip, dinnertime

[Verse 1]
I came up with my niggas, I been through with my niggas
I ran the streets I hugged the block in them same shoes with my niggas
I rolled out with my niggas, we rolled up on them niggas
They put me out that four door and I'll never snitch on my niggas
Now I'm on the road with my niggas, gettin' dough with my niggas
Bankroll, videos, sharin' hoes with my niggas
I give it all for my niggas, got nuttin' but love for my niggas
And I can't trust them other niggas, so I'll just trust my niggas
Said I tried to go to church but it didn't do nothin' for me
Said I tried to pray but it didn't do nothin' for me
I tried to find me a job but it didn't do nothin' for me
So I had to hit the streets, go right back to my nigga

[Chorus]
Right back to my niggas
I go right back to my niggas
And I'm goin' right back to my niggas

[Verse 2]
Still I'll here with my niggas, I never change on my niggas
We hustlin', we gettin' money, we breakin' bread my nigga
I turn up with my niggas, VIP with my niggas
We pop bottles, we throw it up in the strip club with my niggas
Yea I lost some of my niggas, paid for the funeral for my niggas
(What up boy) 8 years and I'm still missin' my nigga
I understand my nigga, I've been through the same my nigga
Gotta feed the baby help out your momma, I feel your pain my nigga
Said I tried to go to church but it didn't do nothin' for me
Said I tried to pray but it didn't do nothin' for me
I tried to find me a job but it didn't do nothin' for me
So I had to hit the streets, go right back to my niggas

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I remember when we used to pitch them pennies my nigga
I remember when we talk about our dreams my nigga
And now we livin' well up in them hills my nigga
If it ever was to go away
I'm right back to my niggas

[Chorus]</pre>
