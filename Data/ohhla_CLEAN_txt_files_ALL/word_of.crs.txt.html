  Yea-uh, here we go here we go here we go
Talk about that Word of Mouf baby!!
  Yeuh, yeuh yeuh yeuh yeuh!  Here we go, here we go
Ludacris, 4-Ize, D.E. what you want now now now now

[Ludacris]
Check it
You see I live a life filled with chicken and malt liquor
And women that are real life scratch'n'sniff stickers
I shoot videos and get knobs slobbed in trailers
Then hit stage and break a leg like Lawrence Taylor
You pricks is all talk, and it's bad for ya health
See I ain't gotta say SHIT!  Money speaks for itself
With all models I make I'm +Great+ like five +Lakes+
You got rims on ya truck?  Man I got rims in my skates!
You rollin on dubs, I roll right into clubs
Dirtiest home with more rings than ya tub
You think it's all practical jokes and big bloopers
But I smack bitches with no titties that work at Hooters
Just get a couple of girls that shakin they thangs
Then I, put 'em on camera and cut two frames
With some gasoline drawers I'll be goin to hell
Ludacris, fuck like a nigga fresh out of jail!
I got junkyard dawgs, I'm rowdier than Rod Piper
And my baby's assed out, cause I rub my cars with her diapers
So you can pray for now if you sinned in the past
"Word of Mouf" time to wipe that silly grin off yo' ass

[4-Ize]
These rap cats is soft like R&amp;B singers
It's 4-Ize, I've worked for wings and chicken fingers
I rep Smoke Park so Chi-Town could get seen
I'm a Dirty Bird now but I keep shit clean
I rip meanface niggaz one by one
or two by two, I'll take 'em however they come
Instead of a gun, I'll pull out a stick from woodworkin
The black Hacksaw Jim Duggan stay lurkin
Creepin, I'm in the shadows, the nightshade
You want the tail in the back or, a light fade?
Cause Tony Scissorhands is the barber, the butcher
I kill ya smoke a blunt and forget where I put ya
I'm Superfly like Snuka, I smack hoes
The black rose with the dozen attack flows
I rock Shaq's clothes when I alter beast
Power up, get big, it's Disturbin' Tha Peace
