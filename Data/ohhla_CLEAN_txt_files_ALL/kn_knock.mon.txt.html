[Monica]
It's funny how the tables turn, turn, turn, turn

[Missy] (Monica)
Uhhh uhhh (ohhhh-ooohh) and it's sooo, woo
(Wooooo-oooo, yeah) This that hot
(Wooooo-ooooo, yeahhhh) Uh huhhh, yeah! New Monica!

[Verse One: Monica] {Missy}
It's funny how the tables turn
Now it's you running after me {huhhh}
Didn't wanna spend quality time
Didn't think I would ever leave {woooo}
You got way too comfortable {ohhh}
Now you say you want me in your life {huhhh}
Cuz I've packed up all my shh {woooo}
I'm moving in my new place tonight

[Chorus: Monica] {Missy}
So don't you, knock knock knock
Stop knockin' (stop knockin')
Don't come knockin' on my door (yeahhh)
(Oooo yeahhhhh) Ring ring ring (ring)
Let the phone stop (oohhh)
I don't want you calling me no mo'

{Uh huhhhh, soooo, sooo}

[Verse Two: Monica] {Missy}
Boy, it's a dangerous game
To try and play a chick like me {huhhh}
Wanna go out and do ya thing
I'll be out 'fore you count to three
So do just what you want
Any time that you really like
I put a payment on my place
You'll be sleeping alone tonight

[Chorus: Monica] {Missy}
So don't you, knock knock knock (knockin', ooohhh)
Stop knockin', don't come knockin' on my door
(Don't you come knockin' at, wooaayy)
Ring ring ring (ring)
Let the phone stop (oohhh)
I don't want you calling me no mo'

{Uh huhhhh, soooo, sooo} (yeah)

[Verse Three: Monica (*rapping*)] {Missy}
I used to be So Gone, you were someone I could lean on
My life support system
And I thought I couldn't breathe, uhh uhh
When you used to leave, yup yup (yeahhhh) {ohhh}
I see you got your clean on
Big chains, gold teeth and your gleam on
All night wanna be gone
Wanna tell me stay home like I got a uhh ring on {wooo}
Then you say I'm not your wife, right right {huhh}
So why should I be chillin', goodnight goodnight {huhh}
Now pack up my things for a flight {ohhh}
I got a place and it's fixed up nice {come on!}
So don't come knockin' on my door {yeah!}
I got company coming 'round four {uhh huhh}
So, whoa, heh heh, yeah {oohh}

[Chorus: Monica] {Missy}
I don't want you calling me no mo'
Knock knock knock {oohhh}
Stop knockin', don't come knockin' on my door
(Ring ring ring) ring ring ring
Let the phone stop (please won't it stop)
I don't want you calling me no mo'

[Monica] {Missy}
"Don't come knockin' on my door" {Uh huhhhh, sooo, soooo}
"Don't come knockin' on my door"
Ooohh oooh uhh, ooohh oohh uhh
