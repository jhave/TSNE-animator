Yeah, we balling baby
(As we proceed to give you what we need) thats right
Oh you dont know, we gonna tell you how it is

Chorus:

When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life
When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life

Verse One:

YOu thought it was a fad, you really cant understand rap
How these young playas come up and live fat
Big houses, cars, watch the homies bubble
Do a lot of good but cant stay out of trouble
?? cause hes the president, he bought a lot of stuff you could never get
Take us to the game you wanna see my bus, 
but all the little kids wanna be like us
When they get home, and turn the TV on, 
its Too $hort baby on the microphone
I see a lot of styles when im watching videos 
Looking at the backround talking at the hoes
Then they R and B cats incorporated rap into their program
(What happened to the slow jams)
We dropping platinum, numba one, bitch, thats how its done

Chorus:

When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life
When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life

Verse Two:

Lil homie went to school everyday, knew what he wanted
Wa'nt trying to be a thug wa'nt trying to get blunted
It was all a dream, but theres certain things 
You gotta do, like do good in school
His best friend wouldnt listen didnt make good grades
Coach kicked him off the team wouldnt let 'em play
So he stopped going to school and started hangin with some g's
Drinkin beer and smoking weed
Two years later one went to college quick he got a basketball scholarship
His homeboy was in the hood one day got arrested
Took him to the pen they say he got molested
Jealous cause his old friend took the right path
Watching ESPN I saw him in the draft
Now he got a V-12 sittin on dubs, thats how it is when ya what

Chorus:

When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life
When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life

Verse Three:

She used to be a nerd on the honor roll
A four eye conesour, books kinda short on looks
A latch key kid, best friend was her computer
In high school nobody wanted to do her
When she graduated from college she got paid
Got a good job, now she got it made
Gots some contacts, and let her hair down
She gots the legs and the walk that'll make you stare her down
You betta get youre shit together you running out of time
Something on your mind, you need to stop lyin'
You aint balling like her you cant get into the party
Out in beverly hills trying flip a ferrari
Butcha credit aint cool and you got declined
He said "Youre welcome" and "But to come back anytime"
But me, im spending cash for this bitch
And thats just the way it is

Chorus:

When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life
When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life</pre>
