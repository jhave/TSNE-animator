[Intro]
Geah, geah, Gucci
Geah, geah, Juice
Zay we eskimos
Whassup Juan T? Boss Lady?
Geah, E.A., E.A., E.A., I mean
E.A., E.A., E.A., I mean
This a block party nigga, you serve the blocks nigga
or you ain't comin nigga, geah, Atlanta

[Chorus 2X: Gucci Mane]
It's my party, buy a dub if you want to
30 if you want to, 40 then I front you
A block on a plate, take a line if you want to
You know that you want to, I know what'chu gonna do

[Gucci Mane]
10 and a half, 30 bags in a drought (Gucci~!)
Gucci run the 6 with a pot in the vault
Hey yeah I roll, hey yeah I steal
Hey yeah I smoke drink and pop pills (yeah)
Nigga this my party, where do you live? (Huh?)
Who let you in, how'd you get here?
Gucci go bonkers, man the flow's monster
Old folks wonder how I ride Hummer
Corvette, old school, Verte look like Tonka
Fo' deep gangsta, negro wood rocker
Chopper, flames jump out just like Flocka
Nigga drop us be missin like Jimmy Hoffa

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Eskimos baby, where the igloo at?
I'm double if you cut me my wet might leak out
Million dollar traphouse, and I just cashed out (whassup Juice?)
Got the red car cause it cain't mace{?} out
And I bring packs out, thrice house, sex out
It's my block, this where them feds get slammed out (yeah)
and issue that crack out (yeah) two chicks at my crack house (yeah)
Can I suck your dick? Hell nah you junkie bitch
Can't touch my work or dick your worthless piece of shit
I'm up three million, and that's just here licks
I sell white icks, on to that bass bricks
Save your compartment, save the deposit
Glock no safety, I already cocked it
Gucci two bands, can't fit in a wallet
I'm all 'bout the profit, the feds keep watchin
Gucci two bands, can't fit in a wallet
I'm all 'bout the profit, the feds keep watchin (Gucci)

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I turned my Glock, to a Mac, with a 30 round clip
Everybody step back, I'm fin' to let this fucker rip
Nigga don't slip, sniper rifle equal
Street sweeper hit that ass here the bill on the igloo
Buy the tips, and the Glock, bet that sink your battleship
Pussy bwoy, musta thought, Gucci Mane wouldn't rip
Who the hell you think I am? Musta thought I was a bitch
Last time I took a piss, man I knew I had a dick - PUSSY~!
