[Scarface]
Niggaz forget about the streets but when they rap they songs
They claim they tote the heat, they quick to clap they guns
In interviews be braggin bout the crack they slung
But when it's war, these cowards never blast, they run
The fuck you think you foolin dog? I live this shit
I know it when niggaz fake it - I live this shit
You can front it all you want but when yo ass gets hot
Then you can rest assured nigga - yo ass gets got
I'm sayin that to say this - I can plot those hits
I'm connected in every city on capo shit
I ain't even gotta say these niggaz know my ties
A nigga made, therefore whoever cross gon die
Money changin motherfuckers, makin hoes grow nuts
You a bad motherfucker, you don't give no fuck
Let me snap you back to reality dude, shit's real
You a target, niggaz in Houston want you killed
Facemob until it's over, Southside the pipes
Dirty Third in this bitch, J. Prince for life
Dedicated to these niggaz live and breathe that shit
Let the real niggaz shout it out, scream that shit

[Chorus - Scarface]
I never snitch, I never lie
I'm not a bitch, I rather die
Can't nothin change me, not even time
I make the money, money don't make me a dime (x2)

[Beanie Siegel]
Facemob! Yeah
B. Sieg baby, I'm back up in this bitch like what
Fresh out the pen, once again I'm here to grab my nuts
I am hell for real - you doubt it nigga? call my bluff
Only respect men that's real, you coward rat-ass fucks
Who raised you niggaz? Yo father probably hate yo guts
Mad he didn't double up, and that Lifestyle bust
Ya lifestyle fucked, ya duckin, every corner tryna clap at you
Plus fuck ya mother, the bitch ain't shit for havin you
What? If you don't like what I'm sayin, fuck ya attitude
Same lame probably showed these rap niggaz gratitude
Huh, happy they ain't snitch on you
Must I remind yo monkey ass what a bitch might do?
They act like they got yo back to infiltrate yo rest
Then have you talkin +Through The Wire+ like Kanye West
To all my real niggaz trapped homey, mind yo tongues
Cuz these cowards comin home after firin they ones (?)
I never snitch

[Chorus x2]

[The Game]
Snitch niggaz, bitch niggaz, they all the same face
No matter what hole you crawl in, nigga you ain't safe
All you niggaz is rats, nicknamed Jake
Sam, Curtis or Alpo belong in the same place
A penitentary cell block gettin gang raped
Coward motherfucker, now tell me how my name taste
I leave you bleedin like ya period came late
Red bandana on, call that my Game Face
Niggaz come in all shapes
Some snitches wear Reeboks, some wear Bathing Apes
Sometimes they Crip niggaz, other times Piru
And some snitch niggaz look just like you
I promise to never snitch, like some of my homies
G-Rock, B-Mase, and O.G. Tony
Before I have the police run in ya house
I kiss my son on the cheek and put the gun in my mouth, motherfuckers

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
