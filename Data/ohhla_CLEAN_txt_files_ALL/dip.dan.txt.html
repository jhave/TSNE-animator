Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Dip I dip you dip I dip
Dip I dip you dip I dip
Dip you dip I dip
Dip you dip I dip
Don't let me into my zone [x3]
You haters leave me alone
I say, don't let me into my zone [x3]
You haters leave me alone

[Verse 1]
Like Lieutenant Dan I'm rollin'
Back to back I keep on smokin'
Eyes keep shakin' and I can't stay focused
I don't give a fuck if you niggas ain't noticed
I'm sweatin' but I'm cold
Mouth all dry but I got a runny nose
I just bought me a water bottle
Chug that down but I think I need me some mo'
And I keep feelin' like I'm gon' faint
But fuck that nigga pass me that drank
I done drunk too much I might throw up in a hotel bathroom sink
Bitch I'm wildin, I'm zooted
Can't believe that I'm even movin'
Off a half a gram of molly we about to go party
And I don't know what I'm doin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now all these rappers talkin' bout that molly
Bet a million dollars these niggas ain't dippin'
Pure MDMA put it in a shot we talkin' bout crystals
Been dancin' hard up all day
Rest in peace to Mac Dre
Throw up the T
Scratch on my face
Do the Thizzle dance up in the place
I'm grindin on your bitch while I'm grindin' on my teeth
Don't give a flying fuck
So right now you don't want beef
I'm blown, I'm zooted
Can't believe that I'm even movin'
Off a half a gram of molly we about to go party
And I don't know what I'm doin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
She licked it off my index
Before that she been wet
Now she licking on her best friend
While they suck me watching sunset
That's right bitch we ain't done yet
Lifting her purse, undress
It kicked in she lickin'
Before I blink she undressed
Molly making her feel good
It's a feeling she can't explain
But obvious we got some problems
So bitch let's kill that pain
I'm blown, I'm zooted
Can't believe I'm even movin'
Off a half a gram of molly we about to go party
And I don't know what I'm doin'

[Chorus]</pre>
