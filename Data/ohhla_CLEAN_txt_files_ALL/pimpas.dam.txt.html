[Intro: Black Thought]
And yes y'all, you now rockin with the best
Black Thought from the legendary Roots crew in the flesh
I slid up in here with the brothers from the Marley family, crestin, we 'gon set for y'all

[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
Hey! She loves to party, have a good time
She looks so hearty, feeling fine
She loves to smoke, sometimes snorting coke
She's laughing when there ain't no joke, hey!!!

[Chorus: Stephen Marley] (Background Singers)
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was, now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was

[Verse 2: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley]
Cause coke was a thing that once she first tried
Was once a blue moon to once a blue sky
And now she's wonderin who else wants to go by
She don't got no money and wants to get high
Story sounds familiar like born to be wild
But she sillier, not quite the same but she similiar
A waste of a saucy perilier
Used to look good in the videos now she look hideous
Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces
Work the cold nights red district places
She seen more hotels then my tour suitcases
Or male customers than Old Navy
She love limelight more than John Swayze
Seen more miles than I rent an AV
She don't slow down then some day maybe
She lost then she can't find her way to safety

[Chorus: Stephen Marley] (Background Singers)
(Pimpa'ss paradise) That's all she was now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was, now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Check it out! She keep her head up in space like a satellite
Because she got a insatiable appetite
For stayin out late night with all the parasites
Plottin on the way to cop a little piece of paradise
Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice
Just get the monkey off her back and she be back in like
Five minutes, she stay on the move
She looked smoked up, and stoned at the buildin refused
All coked up, alone she ain't even in tuned
And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use
She was a pretty girl cleaner than the board of health studied than enjoyed herself
I don't know what drove her to avoid herself
Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay
And now she on the track workin while she wastin away
It's safe to say she lookin for some place to stay
Whoever got a lil' paper to play could get a slice of this...

[Chorus: Stephen Marley] (Background Singers)
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was, now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was

[Verse 3: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley]
For no reason a seasoned spliff was the first thing
One spring season while she's out flirtin
Now she season me and don't need rehearsin
And seen get a beaten life is uncertained
Ego need feedin now no one's mercy
Beneath the demons she's a one person
When she's not fiendin swearin and cursin
Behind the curtain she's really hurtin
And while her people don't even trust her at home
The dealer that bring and cook the rock down
And she without sinnin will spot the first stone
The feelin kicks in she's in the dark zone
Old friends walk pass goin bout there own
As if she is someone that they don't know
Then the King Of Kings lift her off the flo'
Sayin life is a thing when you learn you grow

[Chorus: Stephen Marley] (Background Singers)
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was, now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was

[Outro: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley &amp; Stephen Marley]
She rise and fall like a star, her ride off like a car
Her face full of all kind of scar, always with fist start a war
She can't keep herself up to par, she plays like a broken guitar
She always want take it to far
Although she ain't go make it too far
She rise and fall like a star, her ride off like a car
Her face full of all kind of scar, always with fist start a war
She can't keep herself up to par, she plays like a broken guitar
She always want take it to far
Mi wonder if she make it so far, wuy!!!!</pre>
