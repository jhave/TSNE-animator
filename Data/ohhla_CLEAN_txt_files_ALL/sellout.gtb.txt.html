[Intro: DJ Ready Red scratching quotes below w/echoes]
The Negro, the negro still.. is not free  

No Sell out!! ------&gt; Scarface

The Negro, the negro still... is not free  

No Sell out!! ------&gt; Scarface

[Willie D]
Here's another Geto Boys' release
I came to teach to those I didn't reach
On the G.O., with a clean cut so
Don't give me no junk about the radio
Kiss it where the sun don't shine
I think it's time the public knew the time
Rap Music, they're trying to ban it
Cause blacks are getting paid and they can't stand it
They say we're too violent for instance
But why in the hell is Rock still in existence?
I'ma tell you why it still remains, like a coat it'll hang
Cause it's a white thing
This attack on the black sound
Is just one more plot to keep brotherman down
I ain't with this, God is my witness
Somebody better tell those folks I mean business
And it ain't no sell out

[Chorus: DJ Ready Red scratching the quote below]
Black man, stand up!!
Somebody has to speak the truth against it
Black man, stand up!!
Somebody has to speak the truth against it

[Willie D]
Public Enemy was dissed by the industry
Cause the people they trusted sold out to the..
Opposition and superstition
The foundation wasn't sound for the mission
They said the group did something wrong
But that's a lie, you heard the songs
They encouraged blacks to excel
And when that happens, people'll get scared as hell
Call the Police they got rob
Right under that nose, it have to be an inside job
And who was that clown from Washington?
The son of a bitch who triple-cross them
I ain't talking about the provident brother
This particular chump was our color
Got a scoop on the group and he ran
Lock him up for impersonating a black man
Uncle Tom, you want some?
Rap-A-Lot ain't the one, find another son
PE give me five, show them what you got
FIGHT THE POWER!!       -------&gt; Public Enemy
Ain't no sell out

[Break:] 

[Scarface]
Yo D, I'm mad as hell, man
Every time a black man starts preaching the way up to the black community
Them folks get to messing with him

[Willie D] They call that Fear of a Black planet, get me?

[Scarface] I got you

[Willie D]
Well, why don't you get up there and tell these people 
what the Geto Boys already know

[Scarface]
Sure..
We as a people, are not yet free
The first amendment, only applied to the other race
We never had a taste
How can you see the light when you're maced?
Chuck D, Flavor Flav, let them rip
They ain't got enough wind in this trip
For every voice they try to quiet
There'll be another one, and another one starting a riot
If that's what it takes
Yo, I keep the faith, I gotta break
And despite how they sabotage, they gonna have to realize
That this ain't no sell out

[Chorus: w/ Variation]
Black man, stand up!!
Somebody has to speak the truth against it 
Black man, black man
Somebody has to speak the truth against it 

[Willie D]
The truth will set you free, someone quoted
Butt Griff struck a nerve with the jews when he told it
CBS was just looking for a reason
To get him out, and that was all they needed
I wasn't surprised by this tactic 
I knew it would happen, but I didn't know exactly
Triple-Cross go to hell
You think since you did that would start now narrating fairytales?
Think again sucker
If I was a belt you couldn't make me buckle
The Geto Boys, still bringing the noise
You're losing your poise, getting played like toys
Selling the enemy info
That's what got us where we was two hundred years ago
Saw Dollar Signs, didn't ya Captain?
Without sacrifice ain't nothing happening
The plan is to hold us back
The ulitmate gold is total control remember that, Jack
Griff, I got your slack, and I'ma hold it 'til you get back
Cause I ain't going sell out

[Outro: DJ Ready Red scratching quotes below]
Somebody has to speak the truth against it 
What do I care about anger in you?
Somebody has to speak the truth against it 
What do I care about anger in you?
