Wh... what do you mean what was my childhood like?
What difference does that make?
My childhood was messed up, so what?
Everybody's childhood is messed up
This is the nineties.
You find me one person that had it right
What does that got to do with me rhymin'?
What's left?

Now when my mother died, I had to take it in stride
There ain't room for pride in watching your father cry
And dad made it until maybe a year later
When they found his suicide inside of a grain elevator
Got over it, I had no other opposites or options
Thought about whether or not mom and pop was watching
Never bothered for caution, no time for fear
So my folks care-free for most my early years
And I learned from it, turned nuhhhhh! so many corners
Storm my burning sun waiting for the world to plumb it
Finished growing up under my uncle's roof,
He taught me how to count, all the way up to 100 proof.
&gt;From watching him, I learned how to gather nurishiment
Living off from different women that he had to nurture him
And on the surface I became a normal free teen
More afraid of nuclear war then state my TV stinks
My best friend was my TV, gameshows and cartoons
Subsituted for puppies rainbows and balloons
Now here I am, the shy type
And I think I'm doing all right
Considering what it was like within my life

It's all sunshine, It's nothing but sunshine
It's all sunshine, It's nothing but sunshine
It's nothing but sunshine...

Now it's been 17 summers since I've seen my mother
But every night I see her smile inside my dreams
When I was younger, I didn't actually see the accident happen
But every night I see her smile as if a shadow's against the screens
I can only imagine Dad's internal reaction
Straint, infernal burning baloney his brain
Once it takes to make the man that owns achres of land
Abandon the family plan, he drowns himself in his grains

I'm glad I left that farm in northern Minnesota
Where the time moves slower and the winters are colder
Became a city boy where everybody acts like they hold off
Where they stick to themselves and keep a chip on his shoulder

26 years of age, no longer full of rage
I think it's safe to say that I turned the page of my childhood days

Look Ma! I'm a productive member of society!!
When I'm drunk I make noise, but otherwise I live quietly
And on the weekend I go back up north to reminisce
Remember what it was like pretending to be a kid
Late at night I walk the fields, and lurk in the shadows
to get even with life by murdering cattle

MUHHHHHHHHH... MUHHHHHHHHH...
"Come here, yeah! Come here! Yeah! Yeah!! Uhhhh....
 I got sunshiiiiiiiine...  on a clouddddddy dayyyyyyy...
 when it's cold outsiddddddde... I got a month in Mayyy..."

It's all sunshine, It's nothing but sunshine
It's all sunshine, It's nothing but sunshine
(and I'm gonna be alright, you're gonna be alright
you ain't gotta hold my hand, just walk with me tonight...)
It's nothing but sunshine!
It's nothing but sunshine!!

and I'm gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright
You ain't gotta hold my hand
Just walk with me tonight...</pre>
