[Chorus]
If you hear me before you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
If you hear me before you see me (3X)
I got King Kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king kong
king, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
king, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
If you hear me before you see me
I got king, I got king kong in the trunk

[Jibbs]
A yo this beat is bananas
Gave king kong a tree and put 'em in the trunk of the McLaren
So when the doors lift up they fall off (fall off)
Take a look at my ride, you see the doors is all off (all off)
Cause the wheels look flat, trunk so heavy in the back
Got the speakers in the front and they be sitting on my lap
Got the bumper to the ground, cause the trunk weighing it down
They think it's a lowrider when they come from outta town
That's a king kong (in the trunk)
That's the gorillas behing me
So when I'm rolling through your hood anybody can find me
You can hear from the next block
When I'm on the next block
Headed to the next block
Got you jumping to the next block (yea!!)

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
Lil' Momma got you stopping and dropping
When a man stop walking
So I told her she wasn't talking about nothing and she just fronting
[Chamillionaire]
You can hear me from a block and you already know was up
With the women cause they feeling how it rumble in my trunk
I got plenty speakers up in my trunk and I turn it up
And all the ladies loving how it be bumping, they can hear it coming
[Jibbs]
You can hear me before you see me
I got beats up in my trunk
All the ladies want to chase me when they hear my system bump
[Chamillionaire]
Say Jibbs I'm about to head out to that Lou
And holla at you about some fetti, hit my celly soon as you ready
let's get this cheese like a deli
They thought I was a lunatic when I pulled up to the telly
I had that candy coated chevy showing it's grills like it's Nelly
And the ladies love me, why is that?
They love the way I be getting my lean on
Yellow diamond, and bring in my multi-colored diamond bling on
that king kong yea I bet cha this gon' be the theme song
Cause that king kong will have your ears ringing like a ring tone
[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
Yea, yea, yea, yea, them beats is knocking and I got it on lock
Cause I make hits like I'm boxing
Started it up and it sound like a block hit it
Then I have you hanging inside like a pocket PC
See the beats is beating you hear me before you see me
Before you even can reach me and the have you thinking
That this boy is a beast in the streets
While you blinking have you wobbling like you been drinking
I'll eat you, It's like I got speakers in my speakers
So when they speaking on it all that they gon' speak of is a beaster boy
So don't make me just treat you to a feast
A beast that just beats up both of your ear drums

[Chorus]</pre>
