[Fabolous - talking]
Uh huh, uh huh, Fabolous, 702
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh

[Fabolous]
Now of these other chicks don't even come close to you
Anythin less than a dime, ain't negotiable
There holla Fabolous when I swing the Testarossa through
Maybe cause I'm close to Clue, I be in posters too
I rock so much ice, you need shades for a closer view
I beep the horn, that's the most I do
Like what this player supposed to do
Fuck it, pack your bags, let's spend the weekend in Costa boo
You feelin that?

[702]
See he's my property and any girl that touch
I might just call your bluff
Cause I don't give a fuck
Who are you to call my cell
Oh I'm a wish you well
Cause any girl that tried has fell

[Chorus - 702]
Where my girls at
From the front to back
Well is you feelin that
Well put one hand up, can you repeat that
Tryin to take my man, see I don't need that
So don't play yourself

Where my girls at
From the front to back
Well is you feelin that
Well put one hand up, can you repeat that
Tryin' to take my man, see I don't need that

[702]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't you violate me
Cause I'm a make ya hate me
If you decide to mess with mine
Shrunk you down to size
Make ya realize
You done messed up this time

[Chorus]

[Break - 702]
You must learn the rules
Don't come close to
Anything that belongs to me
He is my, my property
So you must leave

[Fabolous - talking behind Break]
Uh huh, uh huh, Where my girls at?
Fabolous, F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S
Uh, uh, uh

[Fabolous]
Don't front ma, who kept you rockin all the stones?
Hit the mall, you can pick and roll like Stockton and Malone
Must of dropped bread on my skew, girls be flockin to my home
When I got a case, quick tryin to get Cochran on the phone
Chicks don't want you in karats, that make your pinkie finger glow
They wanna argue and are fightin on the Jerry Springer show
Yours friends want Fabolous, there's more fishes in the sea
Schemin since I put the deep dishes on the V
Just to let you know, it's nothin when you ask for green
Took you to Cristal, for them cats and cream
I'm the one that had you rockin Icebergs to affairs
Icebergs for your gear, Icebergs in your hair
I don't know how them dirty birds got the cell digits
When I come home you pat me down like jail visits
All I wanna do is stay close to you
Fabolous, Desert Storm, 702
Ya heard

[Chorus]</pre>
