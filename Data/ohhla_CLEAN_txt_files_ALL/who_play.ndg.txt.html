Just in case you didn't know, I blow (I blow)
constantly for dough
I'm sittin next to my heat (my heat)
Fuck peace, as I listen to the beat

We came to rock your body, ding ding dong
We came to rock your body, all night long
We came to rock your body, ding ding dong
We came to rock your body, all night long

Way back in the days when the hottest thang was Jherri curls
When you could always spot a gangsta
by the way his hair out grew his girl's
There lived a little boy who wore khakis everyday
He never would be broke he swore, always to get paid
Up jump the boogie the bang the bang boogie
Got them same ol' gangsta ways
Up jump the boogie the bang the bang boogie
And I ain't the one to get played

	[Chorus]
	Who's playin games man I really hope you burn
	Who's playin games when I'm gonna get my turn
	Who's playin games I don't wanna be left out
	Who's playin games you playin</pre>
