Handle it, handle it
You know, motherfuckers need to have some weed etiquete
True, true
You see, motherfuckers try to come up and bogard your weed
At the club, and they don't wanna share theirs
Can I get a hit of your weed [repeats in background 6X]

[B-Real]
You know I hate it when I roll a joint and give it to somebody
Who ain't got weed but they wanna be up in the party
Laughin and gigglin, sippin on a Heinie
Son you need a Tic Tac your breath is gonna blind me
Talkin about you wanna hit, spittin in my eardrum
Oh you new in the cypher, step to the rear son
Still they manage to hit it, and put they grip on it
That's when they wet the tip and put they lips on it
Then when you get it, forget it, it's been wetted
Who gonna hit it now, not me, you got me
Thinkin about these fuckin jokers, double tokers
Smokers who hit it like they suckin a dick, fuckers
Flippin it, lovin it, smokin it to the head
Givin it to me half way down, "thanks again"
Then when you see 'em later smokin they own stash
When you ask 'em for a hit, they say, "sorry this is my last"
I shared some with you, "Sorry that's not my problem
Talk to the hand but I got plenty if you wanna buy some"
These people piss me off, this is true indeed
But nothin's worse when someone's askin for some weed
What do I look like a tree where the bud grows
Here pick my left nut and smoke it in the bol
Or better grow your own leave mine alone
Here I'll give you a clone now raise up outta my zone
I know I got the best weed, but don't make me
Make your burnt chest bleed what you need
Is weed etiquette, please don't be offended
Cuz the weed costs money I'm the one who has to spend it

And that's just the way it is man
Y'all motherfuckers need to learn
You just can't come, askin for some shit and not givin none in return
What the fuck is that man? We goin into 2000 motherfucker
You need to learn how to smoke some weed with people
Pass it to the left motherfuckers
Can I get a hit of your weed [repeats to the end]</pre>
