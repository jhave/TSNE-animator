[Chorus]
They see me mowin', my front lawn
I know they're all thinking I'm so white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't you see I'm white and nerdy?
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
I wanna roll with, the gangstas
But so far they all think I'm too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
Really really white and nerdy

First in my class here at MIT
Got skills, I'm a champion at D&amp;D
M.C. Escher - that's my favorite "M.C."
Keep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea
My rims never spin, to the contrary
You'll find that they're quite stationary
All of my action figures are cherry
Steven Hawking's in my library
My MySpace page is all totally pimped out
Got people beggin for my Top 8 spaces
Yo, I know pi to a thousand places
Ain't got no grills but I still wear braces
I order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise
I'm a whiz at Minesweeper - I could play for days
Once you see my sweet moves, you're gonna stay amazed
My fingers movin so fast I'll set the place ablaze
There's no killer app I haven't run
At Pascal, well I'm number one
Do vector calculus just for fun
I ain't got a gat but I got a soldering gun
"Happy Days" is my favorite theme song
I could sure kick your butt in a game of ping pong
I'll ace any trivia quiz you bring on
I'm fluent in JavaScript as well as Klingon
(Here's the part I sing on)

[Chorus]
They see me roll on, my Segway
I know in my heart they think I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't you see I'm white and nerdy?
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
I'd like to roll with, the gangstas
Although it's apparent I'm too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
How'd I get so white and nerdy?

I've been browsin, inspectin X-Men comics, you know I collect 'em
The pens in my pocket, I must protect 'em
My ergonomic keyboard never leaves me bored
Shopping online for deals on some writable media
I edit Wikipedia
I memorized "Holy Grail" really well
I can recite it right now and have you "ROTFLOL"
I got a business doing websites
When my friends need some code, who do they call?
I do HTML for 'em all, even made a homepage for my dog, yo
I got myself a fanny pack
They were havin a sale down at The Gap
Spend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap
Pop, pop, hope no one sees me, gettin freaky
I'm nerdy in the extreme and whiter than sour cream
I was in AV Club and Glee Club and even the Chess Team
Only question I, ever thought was hard
Was do I like Kirk or do I like Picard?
Spend every weekend at the Renaissance Fair
Got my name on my underwear

[Chorus]
They see me strollin', they laughin'
And rollin' their eyes 'cause I'm so white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
All because I'm white and nerdy
Holy cow, I'm white and nerdy!
I wanna bowl with, the gangstas
But, oh well, it's obvious I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy!</pre>
