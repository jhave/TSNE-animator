It's getting late, I haven't seen my date
So tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a bar full of wino's
And his older lady she don't care
My sister looks cute with her braces and boots
And a handful of grease in her hair

Don't give us none of your aggravation
We've had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this town alight
Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright

P-p-p-p-p-p-packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a woman to see me right
I could use a little muscle to get what I need
I'll drink a fifth of Jack and scream out SHE'S WITH ME!
A couple of sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats from the bottom of a glass

Don't give us none of your aggravation
We've had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this town alight
Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright

Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Don't give us none of your aggravation
We've had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this town alight
Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright

Ooh, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright

Ooh, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright</pre>
