[Memphis Bleek]
Yea Memph Bleek(it's not a game)
Get this money(no doubt)
For the Nine double(and home I am wit no trouble)
I stumble thru the Jungle
Yea what y'all want?
Uh huh take it personal
That's right Check it out
Ey yo
I push the bum drop, the M-e-m-p-h man keep the gun hot
And now I live where you come ? I go to war where you bag chicks
Floss where you can't sit, what the fuck y'all want?
I do the thingz that you can't do, fly to the ankle, cock pick the shorty
You Asleep when I came through, it's fucked up what this game'll do
Next thing that's fucked up is when I aim at you, spit eight at your range rov
If you ever talk shit like I ain't know, you get it right, I Play corners 
Pocket full of drugz, two dollars from a dub, 
then I holla I don't really give a fuck
We raw, green you ain't seen before, 
chicks stink wit a ass you ain't squeezed before
Got gunz now, that hold 16 or more, 
for you crab ass niggaz who wanna meet the floor

[Chorus]
Yea I won't stop(for bitch niggaz, broke all yo life afiliate wit rich niggaz)
I won't stop(for bitch niggaz, broke all yo life afiliate wit rich niggaz)
I won't stop(for bitch niggaz, broke all yo life afiliate wit rich niggaz)
I won't stop(for bitch niggaz, broke all yo life afiliate wit rich niggaz)

[Memphis Bleek]
I'm the type to pull rank, hold shanks, project huss-elar
Walk where you can't muthafucka, for the Nine double
My S1 still bubble, test one, you gon feel the M-1 touch you
Gunz galore, smoke tonz of raw, how you ball before?
Never ran the floor, never run scrimmage, if you ever take my image
I'ma see to it you niggaz gon hemorage
Bleed from the waist down, leave you face down
For cashin the bricks, Bleek spray townz, this game of life
You on the line, I'll play foul, better pass the rock
Or jump outta boundz, I get techs in the game
I foul y'all flagrant, hurt y'all severely, you da type that be hatin
Sub Bleek These niggaz guard box time
Let the bench get in the game and spark that side, mufucka

[Chorus]
Yea I won't stop(for bitch niggaz, broke all yo life afiliate wit rich niggaz)
I won't stop(for bitch niggaz, broke all yo life afiliate wit rich niggaz)
I won't stop(for bitch niggaz, broke all yo life afiliate wit rich niggaz)
I won't stop(for bitch niggaz, broke all yo life afiliate wit rich niggaz)</pre>
