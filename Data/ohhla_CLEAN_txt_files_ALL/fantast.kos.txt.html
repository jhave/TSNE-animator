(K-OS)
Yo, uh uh uh uh uh
This is the mission out a small time thing
Let me tell you bout what happened when the phone went
I was chillin' at the crib with this girl named Wise
She was kissin' my brain, caressin' my third eye
When the phone rang, I couldn't believe it
Told myself to forget it, ignore it, leave it
But just when things started goin' great
It rang again, I said hold up, wait
Picked up the phone, "Yeah who the hell is this?"
Somebody said, "This is serious business
Hip hop is dyin' it's all Darth Vader
So pick up your mic and swing your light sabre."
The Skywalker, the fly talker from the T-dot
We got, beats and lyrics to get you up
Kick in the door, wavin' my ASR
Who got my back? In fact it's Figure Four
I keep it raw, cross the city just like gore
Rappers are claimin' to be hardcore
But never no more

(Chorus: K-OS)
Some just lost, they floss they don't get it
When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
If you love this life I know you'll get with it
Cause all in all it's fantastique
Some just lost, they floss they don't get it
When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
If you love this life I know you'll get with it
Cause all in all it's fantastique

(K-OS)
There's only two digits; zero and number one
But some get fooled by countin' bullets in a gun
I make a run, with that renegade Red 1
We so close you can figure us cousins
So step up if you want to get taxed
Hip hop used to be black, but now it laxed
The brick cause they mostly spit like demonology
My psychology not dependant on pimpology
Cause pimps just react to things, men make em happen
This rappin' dedicated to soul clappin'
If you got soul, than The Infinite's in control
Stop using mine, people to legitimize
Youself cause you raped the Earth and tell lies
My man positive intelligent and wise
I don't suck energy son, I energize
This is dedicated to make it live, bring it back

(Chorus: K-OS)</pre>
