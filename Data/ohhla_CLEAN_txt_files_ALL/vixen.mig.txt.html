Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Let's play a little game
Just between you and I
I'll be yours in physical
You gotta use your mind
We can be cops and robbers
Tarzan and Jane, Marilyn and Robert
But either way the objective is the same
To please and entertain

You will be my vixen
My bed'll be your stage
We will get the spotlight all night
Each and every time we play
You will be my vixen
As we improvise
Delivering a captivating performance every time

Why not be creative
Pull out all the stops
You can pick the scene
If I can pick the props
Do you prefer classroom or office
Masquerade expert or novice
We can play
The objective is the same
To please and entertain

[2x]
You will be my vixen
My bed'll be your stage
We will get the spotlight all night
Each and every time we play
You will be my vixen
As we improvise
Delivering a captivating performance every time

Baby together we can't lose.
And I know you're always down for something new
When we're making love let's put on a show
Until the curtains close

[2x]
You will be my vixen
My bed'll be your stage
We will get the spotlight all night
Each and every time we play
You will be my vixen
As we improvise
Delivering a captivating performance every time

Be my vixen
You always said you wanted to be an actress</pre>
