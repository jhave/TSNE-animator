{*a parody of House of Pain's song "Jump Around"*}

Pump it up, stick it in, let me begin
I came and went now I live a life of sin
It starts with the neighbor, she does me a favor
Could go down the block, but I'm savin' some for later
Find 'em, surprise 'em, tell the girl some lies then
If jimmy starts to rise then start lookin' at the thighs and
It doesn't matter where, she happens to be there
Drawers everywhere, pungent odor in the air
Skeezin', pleasin', hope there's no disease and
Her hair up my nose causes uncontrolled sneezin'
All you gotta have is a hole and a heartbeat
On second thought, who needs a heartbeat?
I came to get down, you came to get down
So get out your pants and sleep around

[chorus]
Sleep around (3 x's)
Wake up get up and go down
Hump hump hump...

I make a mess when I'm with somebody else
If the girlie says no I'm whackin' myself
The word on the street is that your momma likes meat
So I'm-a visit for a while see how much she likes me
But when it's your turn be careful not to get burned
Clap on clap off then you're all full of germs
'Cause I'm not sick but she may not be in the same boat
So if you're gonna splash wear a raincoat
But if you wanna lose reality and live in a soap opera
Take the first girl you see and then go bop her
I don't mean to gloat, but when I rock the boat
It reaches up her body to the back of her throat
I came to get down, you came to get down
So get out your pants and sleep around

[chorus]

I move in for the kill, I got a lot of skill
I'll never do a pig 'cause I'm not beastial
But one ho was hairier than a Brittish Terrier
Three's not a crowd, now I say the more the merrier
But I ain't goin' out on no date
Get used to one position, yo I might switch ya
Up, up on the wall, then back accross the floor
Put out for me and you may wake up underneith the kitchen sink
I'm lookin' for my whore, she's going to get sore
Knockin' up girlies then goin' to get more
I came to get down, you came to get down
So get out your pants and sleep around
