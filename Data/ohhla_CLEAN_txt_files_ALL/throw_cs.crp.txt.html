Yeah
East Side Avalon 45 Crip (CaRIP!)
88, 11-6, you know what I'm sayin' (right Cuz)
And we doin' like that you know what I mean (yeah)
B-K (yeah)
Slob Killer (Slob!)
Fuck Sway
You see me though
Or do you hear me though
We about to break it off like this
Loc'd out

[TWIN LOC]
Loc'd out in the brain from that motherfuckin' A gang
I bang with the down and remain for that money man
To jack me a slug, pull the trigger, blow his brains out
A tisket, a tasket, closed casket is wanna I'm talkin' about
I blast a Slob, leave him wealin' in a wheelchair
I really don't give a fuck
I really don't fuck and care
Crip in me
I take Slobs like cats
Givin' up Avalon, beat them down with bats
Check my tatts on backarm, forearms and neck
40 A.G.C. is what you get
It's the shit
I bust on Slobs on the regular
Fuck penicillin 'cause they need to get rid of that
Period collar busta I put that on the land
My homies beated down your homies with they barehead
A.G.C. enemies catch the blues
And I wouldn't wanna walk in no Slob shoes

[TWIN LOC]
East/Side Avalon nigga simply don't care
So if your ass straight crippin' throw them C's in the air
If you really wanna ride on the gangsta tip
Recognize that it's Avalon Crip

[TWIN LOC]
Chitty-chitty-bang-bang, Avalon Crip Gang
Do this to the fullest 'cause I do this shit everyday
To spray this slug quick in a hurry
Pop-Pop to your dome now your mama gots to bury
Another bitch-ass Slob
That's I'm singin'
Let me catch one of your bitch-ass niggas I'm straight sprayin'
Stayin' - down, A's up to my homies
Especially to my niggas Trouble Syke and Sneaky Tony
And all my soldiers in the motherfuckin' system
Ain't havin' no bitch-ass Slob tryin' to dis them
We in it to win it loc'd out Crips strong and when I die
I walk Crippin' graved in my tombstone
Realize a loc'd out real fuckin' rider
With real gangsta lyrics stickin' like a screwdriver, I provide a
Strap for my homies if you willin for a Slob massacre
Another Avalon killin' Cuz

[TWIN LOC]
East/Side Avalon nigga simply don't care

And leavin' busta down to the concrete
