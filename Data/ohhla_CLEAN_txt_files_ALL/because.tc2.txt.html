That's, boy Dat Nigga Daz, I approach ya slowly but surely
Oh shit! She stuck her fuckin hands down my pants
Oh shit! Whipped it out and grabbed it tightly in her hands
Oh shit! She got to blowin, suckin, give up
I finally bust a nut and said "I DON'T GIVE A FUCK!"

[Tha Realest]
You know I heard you got some bomb ass pussy, so do this thug a favor

You got me smilin, profilin and spendin hella cash on that ass (What?)
I try my best not to blink cos then I'm missin ass
I be a sex fiend addicted to some scandalous shit
Intoxicated the whole time while I'm up in your shit
So understand these rules before you play the fuckin game
Bitches are all the same, baby we ain't ashamed

[Kurupt]
Check it out
I want my dick blew off the hinges, homey don't you want it too?
Well I'ma tell you what the fuck we gon' do (What?)

Call me Big Poppa Rayfield, mashin the Cutlass, bitch rollin dirty
G'd up, rollin with an old 30-30, know why bitch?

Chorus:
