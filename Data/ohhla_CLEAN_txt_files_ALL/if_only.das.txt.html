"And it go a little something like this"     "Hit it!"

Verse One: Books

Shiggity shoz-bots, hots, I rocks
I kiggity-kicks the drama like a farmer picks the crops
Hops, I diggity-digs more wigs than John The Baptist
They call me Mr. Rapper so I guess I be the rappist
No practice, yo Krayzie (Diggity yes?), knocker
Don't bolo like Han Solo, come work like Chewbacca
So ease back, slick, or get kicked in the tush
Yep, I call ya Snaggle if your puss-
Ee gads, I rip shop, until the roof fell in
and plus I piggity-pop your shit like *?Jugglo Ellen?*
But umm, rarely does my crew get into beefus
I fliggity-flips the mould like the gold that's on my cheebas
Oh Jesus, I'm the youngest, Flipsy be the eldest
I'm hipper than the hip bone connected to your pelvis
So hickory dickory dock, diggity-don't your wish

Hook:

"If only it sounded like this"       ".....like this"
*repeat x2*
"like, this"	"like, this"
"If only it sounded like this"	".......like this"
"If only it sounded like this"	".......like this"
*scratching of "like this"*

Verse Two: Dray

Shibbity-bop, shibbity-boo, check out the way I drops the scoop
I'm kniggity-knockin butts out, daily, troop
I friggity-fry the funk that's why they call me Krazyie Drayzie
I giggity-gots more props than that kid named Beatle Bailey
The boogity-woogity Brooklyn boy, he's cool like Grizzly ruin
I swingity-swing more shit than Tarzan be doin
I heard that shit was thick that's why I spick like I was span
then I umm, flip my bit and take a dip like A-qua-man
So, umm, figgity-fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell blunts
I gibbity-got lines like Evil Knievel got bitch stunts
Ya dunce, I'm diggity-down with The Hit Squad, aight
I flippity-fly more heads than Benjamin flew kites
so I, stiggity-start the spliffin, give me your lips so I can rock
I got more skills than John Han got cock
So hickory dickory dock, diggity don't you wish......

Hook:

"If only it sounded like this"       ".....like this"
*repeat x2*
"like, this"	"like, this"
"If only it sounded like this"	".......like this"
"If only it sounded like this"	".......like this"
"If only it sounded like this"	".......like this"
"If only it sounded like this"	".......like this"
*scratching of "like this"*


Verse Three: Skoob, Dray

And a way we go, priggity-praise the Lord, Our Father
I kiggity-caught The Love Boat, ???? ????
I'm finnicky like the cap' but shoots more funk than Funkadelic
It's diggity-Das EFX umm, chum, can you smell it?
Yippity-yapper doozy, watch me ease on down the road, hun
So come on, baby, and do the loco-motion
Umm, so now what the fuck?

I give em a sugar smack then they crack like Daffy Duck
Schmuck, I'm kniggity-knarly, dude, hey swick em
I biggity-bangs the chunks cos they plumps when I cook em
I quiggity-quick-quick, diggity-dick-dick, tiggity-tick-tack-toe
So figado, figado, figado, figa-do
I'm niggity-not the herb but look at the burb, it's gonna stunt
I figgity-funk up Sanford, and his fuckin Son

So hickory dickory dock, diggity don't you wish
