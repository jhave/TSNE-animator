[Frank Ocean]
Oh, wait a minute baby girl can we just sit down
There's a couple things we need to talk about
When you get mad at me, do you really mean what you say?
Or is it just one of them days, when things ain't going your way?
Can we talk about it
without the shouting?

[Chorus 1]
I know we got issues, don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think it's time to rewind and start all over again

[Chorus 2]
Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
We two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm sayin is, there'll be ups and down
But it won't be the last time, can't be the last time

[Frank Ocean]
Can't be the last time, that you get mad at me
For forgettin every little anniversary
or somethin silly like me leaving up the toilet seat
And it can't be the last time, when you say I don't do this
When you say I don't do that, but you know I ain't perfect
Girl no way to explain it, but I know we can make it

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Frank Ocean]
Girl, I love the things you do
Reminds me of the reasons why I'm with you
Like when you walk, out the door
When your clothes, hit the floor
You were just about to break up
and now we 'bout to make up (yeah yeah)
Uh oh oh, oh
Oh ooh woah
Girl just say yeah-ey-yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Let's make up, yeah yeah

[Chorus 2] - repeat to fade</pre>
