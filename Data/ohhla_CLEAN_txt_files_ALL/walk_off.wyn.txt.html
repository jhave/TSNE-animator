[Lil Wayne]
Now put Lil Mack on the map if he walk it off

Say put Lil Fee on the map if he walk it off
Say put E.I on the map if he walk it off
Kay put Lil drew on the map if he walk it off
Say put lil monk on the map if he walk it off
I'ma.....I'ma

[Chorus]
I'ma good lookin rapper I ain't tryin to stunt
I'ma good lookin rapper I ain't tryin to stunt
Bitch I'ma good lookin rapper I ain't tryin to front
I'ma good lookin rapper I ain't tryin to front
Hoe I'ma good lookin rapper I ain't lyin to you
I'ma good lookin rapper I ain't lyin to you
You might see me in a Bentley painted royal blue
with the white interior on a set of 22's

[Lil Wayne]
I'ma jalapeno boy hot as Cayenne pepper
I'm from New Orleans City but ill take her to whatever
I'm tougher that leather
I'm smoother than Suede
always never broke cause I'm usually paid
Got the Rover with the cage
Kinda brown off beige
Everybody look at me like I'm riding on stage
Gotta woman named Sage
She twice my age
everytime she hit me up she send a picture with her page
I ain't tryin to fall in love I ain't tryin get engaged
you can meet me at the alter when a nigga really dead
Everytime I'm tryin to leave she beggin me to stay
and I politely fade away like my name was M.J.
and she wrote me a note, guess what that note said
When I hope still like me but I go both ways
and then I say Oh, then I say Okay
Stabbed them up and got the fuck like my name was O.J.
If you lookin for some money bitch my name is no way
Not tomorrow not today not yes-terday
I'm Mr. President as they say
and that phantom fits me like its tailor made
I can take on a war, nigga bombs-away
I been in the water fucking all the Marmalades
If you lookin for some money bitch my name is no way
Not tomorrow not today not yes-terday

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Last week I met a bitch but I forgot her name
Short sweet red cute ole vibrant thang
She got a earing in her pussy and everywhere else
She said she jog everyday so she can cum on herself
Then she tell me my love is the best she felt
and she sucked my dick like its about to melt
she drink vitamin water say its good for her health
she can wrap my whole dick around her waist like a belt
Then theres another bitch her name was Iesha
she ride that dick good and make a mean cheese pizza
One time it was so good I told her to order one mo'
She said its not Domino's its DiGiorno's
Theres another bitch I met her at the gong Show
Got her to the crib and turned it straight into a thong show
She do my dishes, was my clothes, and fix my corn rows
She do my dishes, was my clothes, and fix my corn rows
I can't forget about my bitch name Meaty-boo
shes a young project bitch I used to bang her on the school
so I brung her to the school and we standing on the yard
the bitch asked me if I was from the 17th ward
Niggaz came out the cut and started muggin me up
I grabbed the clip out my pocket and made them cowards duck
and I told my old lady ill be back to see
and hit me up on my cell phone if niggaz lookin for me, cause

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Now chicks gotta ride, twerk, jerk, giddy up
Jump, bounce on the dick and get the fuck, get the fuck
Chicks gotta ride, twerk, jerk, giddy up
Jump, bounce on the dick and get the fuck, get the fuck
My name is Lil Weezy
They say I'm off the heezy
and I tell the dog hoe don't dont you be greedy
My name is Lil Weezy
They say I'm off the heezy
and I tell the dog hoe don't dont you be greedy
dont don't you be greedy
dont don't you be greedy

Cuz its Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat on a dog hoes

[Chorus]
