[Hook with ad-libs]
I'll tell you what to do
If you got you a ho I'll tell you what to do
If you got you a ho I'll tell you what to do
I'll tell you what to do
If you got you a ho I'll tell you what to do
I'll tell you what to do
If you got you a ho I'll tell you what to do
I'll tell you what to do
If you got you a ho I'll tell you what to do
I'll tell you what to do
If you got you a ho I'll tell you what to do
I'll tell you what to do
If you got you a ho I'll tell you what to do
I'll tell you what to do

[AK]
She got ho tendencies
Plus she fucked the whole P$C
Gon' set it out pimpin'
Come on nigga keep it G
She got it from her momma
Oh yes she's a nasty freak
Plus she like 'em you like Boomerang's Lasy Eloise
And ya girl swallows till her voice goes hoarse
She had all kinds of dick tangled up her spinal cord
The laws of physics couldn't explain how her legs behind her head
While she givin' head hangin' off the edge of the bed
Thought she had a milkshake when her bang pop out her head
Pussy fat like Bone Crusher plus the ho ain't "Never Scared"
She licked all the dogs balls scratched all the pussycats
So she goes both ways, yeah she's a brainiac
Knowin' this information how can you be cuffin' that and lovin' that
Already they heard another one they hittin' that and gettin' that
I know you want the ho she like clothes, very trendy
But you need to set her out and stop being stingy

[Hook]
If you got you a ho, I'll tell you what to do
Gon' set the ho out, I'll tell you what to do
If you got you a ho, I'll tell you what to do
Gon' set the ho out, I'll tell you what to do
If you got you a ho, I'll tell you what to do
Gon' set the ho out, I'll tell you what to do
Don't cuff her, set her out
Don't cuff her, set her ou
If you got you a ho, I'll tell you what to do

[Mac Boney]
I'm ol' school Boney, they call me Frank the Tank
The footlong polish sausage boy, streakin' on that drank
I'm the one that get them panties off when they say ya can't
I don't feed a ho shit nothin' but dick and candy paint
I love it when they say they saints, bitch you must be from New Orleans
I'm from the ATL shawty that's what I said she out her jeans
Freaky, freaky wild things constitute for wettest dreams
A white mask and black cape tryin' to make these bitches scream
She nasty as a Luke record, mouth is a cum drain
She goin' up and down on that jeezy do that damn thang
She don't want a damn thing she do it on the face
And she do it all day cause she really love the taste
It's a waste if you tryin' to keep that action to yo damn self
We'll tag team me and shawty share the same belt
It don't really matter if you dig her or you dis her man
Do your boy a favor when you out don't kiss her man

[Hook]

[T.I.]
Any real pimp'll know
The kind of chick I'm lookin' fo'
Actresses in movies and the models in the video
Call me Deuce Bigalow, cold blooded gigolo
Give the ho the rod then tell her let my nigga go
Pussy pumper number one'lll hit the club and pick a ho
Let her hit the dro then swing her by the liquor sto'
Feed her ho snacks, everything you get you get to go
We ain't on no date what you eatin' drinkin' sittin' fo'
Walkin' through the hotel me and five and six or mo'
Any ho'll tell you he a balla he trickin' though
P$C around it's goin down you better get ya ho
Have her gettin' loose tongue kissin' on the patio
Well known groupie let her momma and her daddy know
First she yellin' give it to me then she yellin' daddy no
Man I feed her Oreos, you take your freak to Pappadeaux's
Me and C and Kuntry we be flip floppin' swappin' hoes
