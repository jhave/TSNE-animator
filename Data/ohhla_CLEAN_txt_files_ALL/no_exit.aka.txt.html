I wanna get out this relationship 
But I'm scared that my man will flip 
He always swears how he's gonna kill me 
And fill me with the bullets from his clip 

[Verse 1] 
I met her in Queens her personality was erotic 
She asked me where I come from, and I just replied "The projects" 
Love at first sight as she was staring 
Checking me up and down, yeah, at the gear that I was wearing 
I had an office jacket, Polo shirt, diamond on my hand 
Stonewashed pants ticked inside of some Timberlands 
Her eyes just stayed on my face 
She threw her hand on my hip and felt the four-fifths on my waist 
Yo, my name is Ak the hard rock shit that shot a cop with a glock 
Cause he tried to make the money STOP 
She didn't speak, she didn't START, she didn't TALK 
All of the sudden let's take a WALK through the PARK 
But it was dark, she didn't bother 
She probably thought I was trying to play her out 
Like a Central Park jogger 
But that's not my style that's what I'm telling ya 
Give me your number and I'll probably call you up on my cellular 
At night we spoke for hours and hours and hours and hours 
Hot convo turned into cold showers 
Monogamy, yo, increased to pornography 
Miss Astrologist because she looked like a star to me 
But I be dressing sharper than those brothers with Farrakahan 
Throwing a lucky charm without a leprachaun's arm 
Out on the streets dealing and sticking up 
I try to make her look appealing 
I went out and started tricking bucks 
I got her all dressed up, she used to look messed up 
Now all of her friends can't wait to be next up 
I need to get her thoughts fixed up 
She fell into a blender, she got the stuff all mixed up 
She caught me talking about a quits 
But that's that old bullshit 
It's ain't over til I say it's over, miss 
So if you wanna catch a fit, you catch a melon split 
Once you in there ain't no exit 

Chorus 

[Verse 2] 
I talk a good game of pain 
Put it in your ear and let it rain 
Benadryl can't stop the migrane 
Once my voice touch your brain 
So you can talk that fast slang dialect 
But I got a tec to keep you in check 
Other words make you come correct 
Think that to stop giving the loving 
You must be smoking pestacide because you're damn sure bugging 
After one hit you're ready to split 
What, are you test crashing cars? 
That's that ol' dum dum shit 
You don't flatter me tring to sign off 
You best to take the batteries out your watch if you want some time off 
I write my name on your street curb 
So you can scratchmy letetrs girl if you wanna mark my words 
I got the Calimyne BESIDE ME 
In case you wanna TRY ME 
And break out on my ass like poison IVY 
You better take it or ease, roll up you sleeves 
And prepare to go all out like New Year's Eve 
Trying to take my dough like a Swaggart 
Girl, I have to bag ya and fall on your head like Niagra 
Shit, you're bound to catch it, once I start flexing 
Ayo bum bitch there ain't no exit 

Chorus </pre>
