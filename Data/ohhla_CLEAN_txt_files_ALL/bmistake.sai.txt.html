Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Martin] Da da-da-da-da, da-da, da
{"Man, are you crazy!"}
[Martin] Da da-da-da, yeah, yeah
[Saigon] It's from the heart

[Chorus: G. Martin]
Girl I did you wrong (did you wrong) I hurt you bad (I hurt you bad)
But you must admit, I'm the best mistake that you had
I didn't mean to hurt you baby, I know I don't deserve you lady
Just know that I ain't perfect lady, but I gave you a beautiful baby
At first our love was strong (love was strong) then it all went bad (it all went bad)
But I must admit, you're the best mistake that I had
You didn't mean to hurt me baby, you know you don't deserve me lady
I know that you ain't perfect lady, but you gave me a beautiful baby

[Saigon over Chorus]
Look...
Look what we did, uhh
I did... look
Look what we did
Just look at our kid
Uhh, uhh, uh

[Saigon]
I done been called e'ry kind of dog you could think of
From a big Great Dane on down to a small Teacup
Reason I don't speak up, it's not a lot of truth in it
If I'ma get accused of it you gotta have some proof of it
How you gon' say Brian Daniel a Cocker Spaniel?
Like I'm runnin 'round with way more women than I can handle
This is like a +Scandal+ minus the Kerry Washington
Hard for me to breathe, it's takin my very oxygen
I got a reputation, it's all speculation 
Me and her wasn't goin nowhere, so I changed destinations
Only problem is we share the same offspring
This shit takin its toll and it's costing
Though she probably feelin lower than the Everglades
Though her life probably seen a lot of better days
Got to admit that when she look into that lil' face
She knew I was the best mistake she ever made (ha ha)

[Chorus]

[Saigon over Chorus]
I did, I know I did
Look...
Just look at our kid
Just look what we did
Uhh... I did...
But you, uhh, let's go

[Saigon]
I stabbed my teacher with a pencil in the second grade
Crashed a brand new Benz into an Escalade
But got to admit that when I look into that lil' face
(What?) I knew you was the best mistake I ever made
The devil gave me a lie detector test
Asked me if I ever loved my baby mom and I said yes
He said "You know that this is life or death
And if you lie you die so tellin the truth is what I suggest"
I looked at the devil and I said yes
Blinked twice then that nigga took my last breath
I guess, I never really loved the mother of my offspring
This shit takin its toll and it's costing
Though she probably feelin lower than the Everglades
Though her life probably seen a lot of better days
Got to admit that when she look into that lil' face
She knew I was the best mistake she EVER made!

[G. Martin] + (Saigon)
Girl we should try to get along (think we should try to get along)
It's hard because the love is gone (it's like the love is all gone)
You got mine, I got yours, and I thank God for lookin out for us
This gift that you gave to me means eeeeeeeeverything (sing~!)

[Chorus] - first 1/2

[Saigon]
If I was a mistake, and you was a mistake
Then how can two mistakes create somethin so great?
Every day I awake and I look in that lil' face
I see beyond the bitterness, it diminish the hate (yup)
For the next 18 years we gotta orchestrate (what)
A way to correlate, it's a fine line but I walk it straight
For my son and my daughter's sake
So when they get older they listen to this song and see OUR mistakes
It's fate

[Chorus] - first 1/2

[Saigon over Chorus]
I did, I know I did...
Look at our kid
Just look what we did
