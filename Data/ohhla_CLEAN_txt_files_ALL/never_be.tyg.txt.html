Song:   Never Be the Same
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Never will I be the same... since the money
And cars came with the fame
We just party cause, throwing parties cause I've got a name
For them life is the same
But man, I will never be the same

As I hail mary prayer, my wing to the stage
Grab a hydro oxygen, throw a little cool to face
Never afraid, lyrical grade, amj's win the game
Feeling like a mile, wishing things now was like back in the day
Got a big brick, seen a little... kick
Now everbody and they momma wanna hate
(Everybody and they momma wanna hate)
But what you... wait
Sleeping on me, you won't wake
There's a killer looking in my eyes, you will see thriller nigga

[Chorus]
Never will I be the same... since the money
And cars came with the fame
We just party cause, throwing parties cause I've got a name
For them life is the same
But man, I will never be the same

Rolling down the window on the new benzo
Hollerin at let these bimbos and my girl find out no more
Bring your car... out for me
Shit I was only nineteen
Fuck that by the race, spend these chains on chains (for less case)
More money, more money
Young money, your money
Others tell em' fuck off!
These new niggas all paused!
What's a dog with a bark
To a tiger and a shark
And you wonder why I'm off the raw bitch
Cause I'm bad, bad, to the bone

[Chorus]
Never will I be the same... since the money
And cars came with the fame
We just party cause, throwing parties cause I've got a name
For them life is the same
But man, I will never be the same

I will never be the same (you motha fuckers think you know me?)
I will never be the same (you don't know shit)
I will never be the same (you about me)
I will never be the same (you see, cause I don't even know about me)

I will never be the same
I rise standing on your ceiling that overlook wilshere
We don't gotta go into it rip shit getting into
Nigga, I'll be kinda hostile, I'm numb
Go to the bank, cause it's fun
What you think cause I'm gon send coconuts to a trump that I'm dumb?
Tell that girl kim get some
Two balls for the price of one
You can be my little soccer mom
When I' m done, take my kids, haha
Yeah yo like that, your keys in your lap
Don't get attached close to the king
Had to get it tatted on my back

[Chorus]
Never will I be the same... since the money
And cars came with the fame
We just party cause, throwing parties cause I've got a name
For them life is the same
But man, I will never be the same
I will never be the same
I will never be the same</pre>
