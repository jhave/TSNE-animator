I'm a earth soldier.. we're here
We're here!
I'm here to umm announce that we're
taking names.. putting names on a list..
Thinking about.. what you dream about..
And also what.. you do with those dreams..

"So much soul" --&gt; sample of Common Sense repeats

My life being held within the grasp of fate
Fingertips my ass, shackled to the hips in systematic racism
Facing caustic reefs spread across the concrete
I beat obstacles
Manufactured harass my soul and destiny
We three testaments to hope
(Even though the evil stole this motherfuckin misfit)

Copy referred upon as statistics
List it, test it, shit's burned
Analyzed by report cards, hard to live a life
when you're forced to.. 

UAHH, within the, PIPES of the system
Where as a vision with classism
which means the poor, die, while the rich live high

Taxing your ass I feel like SMACKING that ass
Live on CNN, simulacastin on BBC-1
Punk-ass, politicians gettin cracked with tomahawks
stocked, with my ancient feathers
Plunge you a leather rope, with each HIT
we symbolize hope

"So much soul" --&gt; sample of Common Sense repeats

Give us our freedom back!  Better not.. fall!

Ante up on them mic skills, I'm waiting so patiently
For someone to impress besides the ones who reside
up in my home zone radius, maybe I'm biased but
I think we the highest shit, you could ever purchase
Not to put a price upon the surface cause it won't help
Compare us to a Hummer/space shuttle combination
Age twenty-four earth years, musical relation
reach plateaus of Fugee, without a concert free
Now that's me, destinies trailed without a roadmap
of hardships and mic grips, jealousy, you name it
Get bigger without lettin my ego volcano interrupt
My personality into realms of asshole, you know me
or just want to, it's all cool
As long as you come and put my baby through school
I mean really now, all and together now
Crews 'sposed to put they minds together and make albums sounds HYPE
Living Legends upLIFT the mic, and when the album drop
You know the shit will sound right.. right..
Cause it's so much soul.. cause it's so much soul..
