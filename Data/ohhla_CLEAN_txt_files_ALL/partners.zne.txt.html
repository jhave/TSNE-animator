I told you nigga, she comin through
(Yo, whats up,what you talkin about?)
She gonna do all of us, I mean one by one
(I mean look, everybody?)
Now nigga, you know I got it all under control man
(I mean, last time you said this, she gonna do.)

Hey lil' mama what the dil?
I be real give it to you how you want
Millionaires in the house now
I'm hopin you'll bone it, my niggas that pose with me, buy clothes with me
Know they gotta roll wit me, fuck a lotta hoes wit me
These jealous niggas is mad and I can tell
But fuck 'em, free my niggas they got in jail
I  holla to the world with this pimp game, nothin changed
Catch me on the freeway, take it easy
And it don't stop with the freaky hoes
I wanna see you in the club walkin up to me wit no clothes
Then tell me how you love that, is your pimp game above that, how you love that?

Let me tell my partners come along too, they wanna bone too
They makin money off my song too
All around the world it's the same, meetin pretty women
Spittin game tryna get up in 'em (come on)
I wanna know
Can my partners come along too, they wanna bone too
They makin money off my song too (for all my dogs)
Can my partners come along (hey, hey)
Can my partners come along (hey, check it)

Look baby I can see it in your plan, you want me to be your man baby
(??) fan baby, fine I understand baby
I'm hittin everything I can, they been playin lately
And even though I'm stayin busy in the studio, they buggin me
We can all work together when we freak
You can meet me at the mall at 3, I be shoppin where them ballas be
And I like my women taller than me
And wit the Henney in you strong, Im sure to beat the pussy long
Don't want no babies put the condom on
A couple niggas on the tour bus, it's a small bus
Could you at least do 4 of us?
Let 'em know that you a freak for me,
call your guy let him hear me hit the pussy while I'm hot (I said)
Let 'em know that you a freak for me,
call your guy let him hear me hit the pussy while I'm hot

Can my partners come along too, they wanna bone too
They makin money off my song too
All around the world it's the same meetin pretty women
Spittin game tryna get up in 'em
I wanna know
Can my partners come along too, they wanna bone too
They makin money off my song too
Can my partners come along (hey, hey)
Can my partners come along (hey, hey)

Look baby aint no time to waste
See me rollin with the diamond face, damn its gettin late
And we been fuckin since a quarter eight
Know a nigga need a break, but before you leave set my dog straight
Look at it baby just get it, just me and you
But I been hearin 'bout your freaky friends bring 'em through
Actin out my fantasy, you heard my man and me
Shit, we all family
What you got that we aint see?
And you can tell when its the weekend,
cocktail at the hotel playa bring the freaks in
She wanna know, see a balla (big balla)
And then she thinkin will I call her

Let me tell my partners come along too (c'mon baby) they wanna bone too
They makin money off my song too
All around the world it's the same meetin pretty women
Spittin game tryna get up in 'em
I wanna know
Can my partners come along too, they wanna bone too
They makin money off my song too
Can my partners come along
Can my partners come along (hey, hey)

Let me tell my partners come along too, they wanna bone too
They makin money off my song too
All around the world it's the same meetin pretty women
Spittin game tryna get up in 'em
