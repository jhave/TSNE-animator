[Verse 1 - Mos Def]
With so much drama in the N-Y-C
It's kinda hard bein' M-O-S Def-initely
But I, some how, some way
Keep comin' up with funky ass shit with the Black Jack Jay
May, I, spit a lyric for my ghetto Pe-ople?
Show me 'nough respect when I breeze, through
Riders beep they horn
'cause I keep the party jumpin' like yo' mamma ain't home
I'm just a freak individual singin' my song
Shinin' bright on the mic like it's six in the morn' (six in the morn')
So peep out my manuscript
Reach up, sleevess up, for a second NOW BOUNCE
This is the one that make the party wile' out
Nigga...I said wile' out
Nigga, I SAID wile' out
Lemme show you what we're talkin' about (C'MON!)

[Mos Def]
Huh, ha, yes, hah, uh, hah, rock wit' me now
Uh, ha, yes, ah, uh, rock wit' me now
(You are now rockin' with the best!)
Uh, hah, yes, unnh, ha, uh, come check me now (Black! Jack!)
Uh, hah, uh, yes, hah, uh, uh, BACK TO THE BEAT, like

[Hook - Mos Def {Background Singers}]
{It's The Jump Off} Get it up now!
{It's The Jump Off} C'mon, push it up now!
{It's The Jump Off} Get it up now
{It's The Jump Off} and make it jump now!
{Raise your hands up, it's The Jump-Off}
Uh, push it up now

Nigga jump now
{Raise your hands up, it's The Jump-Off}
Push it up now
{Raise your hands up, it's The Jump-Off}
{Raise your hands...}

[Verse 2 - Ludacris]
Tables fulla hi-hat, a dash of drums
Sprinkle in a little keyboard, a pint of rum
With just a pinch of purple haze and a gallon of bass
Mix snares with rock 'n' roll and throw it all in ya face
Pre-heat the studio to about a hundred degress
Ludacris, Mos Def and your best emcees
You'll get BURNT just for thinkin' you can step to me
Unless the (?) of my (?) get a re-ci-pee
My des-tinies are rhythm, hit 'em with the rhythm
Hit 'em, click 'em, then HA, HA-HA strip 'em
Jump the fuck (back), no gun can pump (that)
I punch the engi-(neer) and slap the whole (track)
Then pop all the speakers and stip the wires
Blow smoke from the MPs and amplifiers
Here to spit truth for the LIAR, LIARS
I'm the hottest emcee, y'all a FIRE-FIRED

[Mos Def] {Background singers}
Huh, yes, uh, ah, yes, uh, yes, hah, c'mon
(You are now rockin' wit' the best)
Woo! Brooklyn, New York City
Hah, take 'em there, Doc

So incredible! Fantastic! (ohh!)
Freak Daddy shit....FIRE!!

C'mon (woo!) nigga, rock to it
Uh (uh), hah (hah), yeah (yeah)
{Clap your hands now, people, clap your hands}
Ridin' high (high)
Ridin' low (low)

Ridin' clean (clean)
