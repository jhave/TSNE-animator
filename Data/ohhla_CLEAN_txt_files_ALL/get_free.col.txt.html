Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[J. Cole - Verse 1]
Strictly for the survivors
The 800 number dodgers
Boy, what I tell ya ass bout picking up that phone
When the number unknown
Tell them people I ain't home
Half black learning white lies
Niggas broke her heart now she trying white guys
Too ashamed to bring around cause her homegirls'll clown like
"Girl I ain't know you like 'em bitesize"
She embarrassed now
On edge cause she gotta meet his parents now
They probably think I'm no good for 'em
Too dark, too thick, too hood for 'em
Now she sitting at the dinner table wondering what I'm doing here
They got me feeling like a job interview in here
They asking questions about a 5 year plan
She saying "who I'm foolin', they could never understand"
They could never understand

[Amber of Dirty Projectors]
Look at me
I Just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[J. Cole - Verse 2]
(Fuck is that smell)
I smell bullshit, it must be an election year
The more I listen man the more you sound less sincere
Still I'm wathcing CNN tryna keep up
In my interviews maybe I should speak up
Tell the world how I feel like you lying all the time
And keep 'em niggas walking blind all the time
But the same niggas think I'm fucking dimes all the time
Like I'm walking round with money on my mind all the time
And I feed into it
I'd rather make tracks where I bleed into it
The singles only the look to sell these niggas the book
I can only pray that one day you'll read into it
If not, fuck it, I got my own problems
Fuck ya beats nigga I produce my own albums
I zone out, that old sound that I've grown out of
Was born out of being broke with hope
But it don't matter I'm on Saturn now and I won't shatter
As long as this blood grows in my bone marrow I'm gonna gather my thoughts
As sharp as a bow and arrow
Back when I had no dough and no apparrel
My flow's thorough, now I'm more aware of the perils a nigga face
Loaded pistols with nickle plates, the nigga fake
That's why I call the shit a race
Tha gony of defeat, wish the elite could get a taste

[Chorus]
Look at me
I Just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[Amber of Dirty Projectors]
We're all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We're all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We're all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
Baby, you know me</pre>
