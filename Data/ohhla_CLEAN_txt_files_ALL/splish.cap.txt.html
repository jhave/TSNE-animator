I know a lot of brothers that think that they can flow
But when I come through, it's like everybody's slow
One kid told me he used to be a pro
Until he bump heads with new Cappachino
You might of seen my face in the old school arena
Dipped like a fresh kid sipping on Pina
I'm a felony, y'all cats a misdemeanor
Eyeballing, all on my dick like Gina
Smiling, you're not really ready for the Whylin'
Came up strong but you scared of Staten Island
All on my chest, oh the big fat medallion
What you don't really want this here rut
Rhyme ? 2 rhyme slut
Battle wit dancehall king, you get struck by the lightning
I tear mics up, y'all need to quit
The name of this rhyme is I splashed the shit
Some of y'all sing like never before
I sleep all day while y'all trying to score
Then I wake up like Alien 3
Coming at y'all niggas that stole the rhymes from me
Bitch, this is how the poor got rich
Lay on the track then insert the hit
Nine months later, the rap world is pregnant
Wu babies blow kid, beware the segment
Rumor has it, Donna darts create magic
Nobody in my team have it
You've seen my face on a $20 dollar bill
Then you hear my voice on an Iron Man reel
It's all tragic, rule not the bull shit-atrics
Your rap is swine, mines is like catfish
Birthday rap style, come on make a wish</pre>
