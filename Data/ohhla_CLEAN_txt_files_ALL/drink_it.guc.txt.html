[Intro: Trey Songz]
Tell 'em what you drinkin (oooh, oooh)
Tell, tell, t-tell 'em what you drinkin
Tell 'em what you drinkin (oooOOOooh-oooh)
Tell, tell, t-tell 'em what you drinkin

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I drink it straight (Hennessy) I drink it straight
I drink it straight (E&amp;J) I drink it straight
I drink it straight (got, Grey Goose) I drink it straight
Patron in my cup, go mix that up
I drink it straight (Gran Marnier) I drink it straight
I drink it straight (Absolute) I drink it straight
I drink it straight (Paul Masson) I drink it straight
Hennessy in my cup, go mix that up

[Gucci Mane]
Club night jumpin, baby roll somethin
Later we humpin, honey that's nothin
Somebody girlfriend in this party
Somebody stop me, the kid done got started
Somebody gonna get drunk this evenin
Gucci got skreet thugs, more than Cleveland
Million on my ice did it just to make a statement
Five hundred dollar tip, left it with the waitress
Shawty say she like me, really love my bracelet
Like my liquor white so you know I ain't racist
The other night to shine I bought the multicolor Jacob
I don't do the push-up, but I do the cook up
Chinnin on these niggaz so I think I need a pull-up
Blue diamonds blind you everytime I dig a booger
Gucci Mane concert, everybody on front
Shawty got a short skirt, man I gotta hit that

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane (Trey Songz) haters sick of me
Like the last thang I ate, they ain't shit to me
Eat filet mignon and it stick to me
Your friendly neighbor flypaper, girls stick to me
Yeah niggaz get rained on, bitches get rained on
So icy boy, everybody got a chain on
(What it do nigga?) I cain't call it
I'm Gucci Mane, Laflare, I'm addicted to ballin
Ballin in the club, drunker than a sailor
Double shot of juice got me standin on the table
Comin too late got me snappin on the waiter
He fuckin up the swag, he a motherfuckin hater
Yeahhhh, that's the business
Kush got me drowsy, pills got me lifted
Lean got me leanin, you can say I'm lousy
Gucci Mane, Laflare, and my stones never cloudy

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Twenty thousand dollar frames and they custom made
Clear diamonds on them thangs so it's hard to say
Got a girl at the blaze snort a ounce a day
She want a Amaretto cocktail but boy get straight
Baby say she want a party, I brought a cake
Told her clean the plate, she cain't feel her face
In the club you can spot us from a mile away
Diamonds in the rain look like Alize
Diamonds in my chain look like Ocean Spray
And the stones ain't cloudy, I make it rain
I got my girl comin in on a private plane
Soon as she touch down, I make her do it again
In the club Gucci Mane doin doin the dance
G5 yeah bitch that's a hell of a plan
Yeah suicide doors so we killin them bitch
Used to play the cards they dealt but now I'm dealin the bitch

[repeat 2X: Trey Songz]
Lean to the left, now lean to the right
If it's in your cup and you feelin alright
We gon' get fucked up, yup all night
Patron in my cup, go mix that up

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I drink it straight...</pre>
