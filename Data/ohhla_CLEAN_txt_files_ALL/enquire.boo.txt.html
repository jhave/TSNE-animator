[Guy] Ay ay
      Ain't you Gangsta Boo? 
[Boo] Yeah
      Why you wanna know? 
[Guy] Ay ay, you
      Ain't you used to go to Sheffield? 
[Boo] What?! 
      See, this is the prime example 
      of some enquiring minds
      Mothafuckas in my business
      Mothafuckas wanna know what I do
      What nigga?! 
      What the fuck you talkin' about?! 
      Why y'all in my business? 
      Enquiring Minds nigga
      Ya know what I'm sayin? 
      This the intro
      I'm bringin' it to you real
      Fuck you mothafucka
      They ain't talkin' 'bout shit
      Y'all know how they niggas is
      These some mothafuckin' playa haters
      What?! 

Nigga do you want me to fuck you up, so 
Hit you wit a low blow 
Jump dawg 
You might as well call it quits 
I be the bitch that's known for rockin' shit 
I be the bitch known as a lyricist 
So, what? You wanna fuck with me on the M-I-C? 
You betta call the police 'cause I'mma bring ya to your knees 
Me &amp; the Tear Da Club Up Thugs can't take enough 
Comin' thicker than the mothafuckin' U.S. Marines 
So if you wanna fuck with me, my favorite quote's 
I'mma take it as a joke ???
Got your ass wishin' that you can take me baby 
Got you hard up like a soap on a rope 
I thought I told ya we ain't gon' stop 
It's on 
So when it's on, life's on, then the bitch is on 
Early mornin'  ????
Enquiring minds wanted to know, that's why I wrote this song 
Wanna fuck me bitch 
Wanna wear my shit 
'Cause I got Chanel on it 
But in the projects you weren't really on it 
Tryin' be the one to flaunt it 
Stupid ass, know that my name is wanted 

Ay ay yo yo
Wassup niggas?
This the intro
Nigga you got 1
You got 2
You got 3
Yo yo
Uhh
Ay ay yo
Stop this shit, and play number 3
I'm outta here</pre>
