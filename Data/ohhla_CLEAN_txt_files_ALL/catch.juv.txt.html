[B.G.]
These hoes.. know.. I act.. bad
They say.. gone.. with your dog.. ass

All fuckin'.. day.. goin' through tha.. night
I fuck.. cousins.. I fuck.. friends
Juvie drive.. Jag.. Geezy ride.. Benz
I'll put that dick on tha ho, look, I'll bust four nuts
Then I open ta see if she can back.. that ass up
Bitch, my dick.. wanna.. feel your.. lips
Don't do it.. right.. go get some.. tips
Come back.. later.. try once.. more
Fuck up a-.. -gain.. bitch, ya gotta.. go
I'm.. gonna.. keep.. doin' my thang
Hot.. Boy B.G. don't play games
Either.. way.. ho, I'll get mine
I'll jack off lookin' you dead in your eyes
So,

(Chorus2x [B.G. + Juvenile])
Bitch, go.. 'head.. catch your.. cut

[Juvenile]
Spread your.. legs.. touch your.. toes
Soon as.. I.. come out these.. 'Bauds
I'm J-U-.. -V.. a H-O-.. -T
B-O-.. -Y.. from that.. three
Bitch, I'm.. hot.. sweaty, gettin'.. moist
Tha girl want me.. ta show her my.. choice
Ya know what I.. mean.. I wanna.. push
Dick in your.. ass like it's a.. dousch
Ya gotta be.. clean.. wash it.. good
Before I.. come.. and lay this.. wood
Eat this.. meat.. please, no.. teeth
Every.. day.. and all through tha.. week
I know whatcha.. need.. liquor and.. weed
A hour and a.. half.. I'll plant this.. seed
You do it for that.. I'll do it for.. game
Both of us.. straight.. ya can't com-.. -plain

(Chorus2x)

[Juvenile]
Look at that.. there.. she big.. find
She could be.. yours.. or she could be.. mine
[B.G.]
It ain't no.. thang.. bring her on a.. trip
Get her in tha.. room.. and she'll get it.. flipped
[Juvenile]
She'll do what she.. do.. and do it.. well
And me and.. you.. could make it.. swell
[B.G.]
I'm your.. nigga.. you my.. dog
We fuck.. cuts.. and there's no.. walls
[Juvenile]
It ain't no.. beef.. you could go.. first
Or both of us.. could go.. and hit that.. skirt
[B.G.]
Once it's.. over.. still don't.. stop
Find us a-.. -nother, and open up shop, nigga
[Juvenile]
I'm with.. that.. man, let's.. go
Out right.. now.. to smash some.. hoes

We play.. that.. just like.. g's
Nigga, I'm.. straight.. 'cause I done bust three
