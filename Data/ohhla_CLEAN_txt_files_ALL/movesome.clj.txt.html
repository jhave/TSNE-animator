LL..
N.O. Joe, hit me baby!

Push it out girl, arch your back
Them 17's is fittin like bubblewrap
Uhh, plus they low on your hips
You there, let me grab
That thing you do keep me brick
50 told you bout the "Magic Stick"
C'mon, lean on me
I'm in love with this scenery
Poke it out
'Pon de river, 'pon de bank baby stroke it out
Sweat for your man
Both hands on your hips for your man
Me and the boys is your biggest fans
Every time we see you we be like DAAAAAAAMN!
Work it girl
Move somethin, hurt me girl - oh!

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
C'mon, c'mon, move somethin
C'mon, c'mon, move somethin
C'mon, c'mon, move somethin
C'mon, c'mon, prove somethin

[LL Cool J]
Such a pimply aura
Way way hotter than I was before-a
She wanna sit courtside next to a baller
Where the paper's longer and cats are taller
Woo!  I'm off on my own
Do the math mami, L's on the throne
Now take it to the floor
Do a split if you really hardcore
Man listen here
I'm hot today, ain't concerned with last year
I see your lil' shorty ride shotgun
But I done left stoplights with a hot one
Made her hop out, and move somethin
Jump in my joint, and prove somethin
He-he, I laugh at y'all
Don't worry about the check, already cashed it y'all

[Chorus]

[LL Cool J]
Uhh, pull it to the side
Shake it for daddy, it's time to ride
Make it sweat 'til it slide
Do your thing like it's justified
Tease me a little
It's my turn to take it to the middle
Let me palm that thing
You got the bomb, I disarm that thing
Turn it around girl, I want that thing
You had to know the way you flaunt that thing
Your body's jumpin
Ain't no frontin when you provin somethin
Made eye contact with me
Now bring that thing back to me
You do your thing so naturally
I think I'm in love, actually

[Chorus] - 2X
