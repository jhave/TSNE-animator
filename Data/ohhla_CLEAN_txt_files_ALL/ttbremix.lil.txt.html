Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Don't nothing but the bass come out my mouth
Yea you know, you stay with me the beast
Don't nothing but the bass come out my mouth

Would you die for me? Make a bitch cry for me?
I'm not going shopping sprees, I'm just setting dreams
I'm just selling then I'm just flipping weed
Please don't tell on me, I got a fellow needs
You thinking this a game but I'm seeing other things
I'm sitting at the top while I'm spilling up this green
You looking in the mirror, what do you see?
A spitting image of me, we making history
I told my bottom bitch don't hesitate to squeeze
Shoot at the knees, just point the beam
If you need the help, don't hesitate to ask
I'm connected in the street so it's live on the gas
Live on the straps so I'm paying for whatever
You're putting on a shirt but you need to wear a sweater
You're putting on this but you need to wear a vest
I put you in the corner like checkmate and chess

Lil boss
Don't nothing but the bass come out my mouth
Don't nothing but the bass come out my mouth

Throw away Glock, switching up the spot
Watching for the cops, posted on the block
Paying for the drop, icing out the watch
Niggas keeping watch, paying for the rock
Like the NBA because you're paying for the blocks
Niggas love the cane, I'm the show you bout to rock
Look like Michael Phelps when he's swimming in the pot
You can make it drip, I'm a make it drop
I give up discovery cause I'm out to shop
Fuck a referee because these niggas never fly
Anything I done and I'm a do it til I drop
Even when I die, I never been shot
I got a purple heart because a nigga never cried
Cause when the nigga hate, bitch I never lie
Cake white my tears because a nigga never cry
Fuck all you suckers I'm a see you in the sky

Lil boss
Lil G shit
Don't nothing but the bass come out my mouth
Don't nothing but the bass come out my mouth</pre>
