[Lil Mo](Ja Rule)
Where would I be
Without you baby
So if you need me
If you want me to put it on you
Because I love you
And don't you forget it
Whenever you need me
If you want me to put it on you, come on
Oh, oh, oh
(Uh, uh)
And darling where would I be?
(Yeah, yeah Ja Rule uh uh uh)
Whoa, whoa, oh
(Where would I be without you)
Baby without you

[Ja Rule](Lil' Mo)
Where would I be without my baby (baby)
The thought alone might break me (ooh)
And I don't wanna go crazy
But every thug needs a lady
(Yeah, yeah)

Girl it feel like you and I been mourning together
Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a, part of me
Mind body and soul ain't no I in we BABY
(No, no)
When you cry who wipes your tears (you)
When you scared, who's telling you there's nothin to fear (you)
Girl I'll always be there
When you need a shoulder to lean on
Never hesitate knowing you can call on, your soul-mate
And vice versa, that's why I be the first to
See Jacob's and frost your wrist up
Now you owe me, I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me

Where would I be without you
(Where would I be without you)
I only think about you
(If what you're saying is true)
I know you're tired or being lonely
(I need someone to hold me)
So baby girl put it on me
(I will, I will, I will)
Where would I be without you
(Where would I be without you)
I only think about you
(If what you're saying is true)
I know you're tired or being lonely
(I need you to hold me)
So baby girl put it on me
(Whoa, whoa)

[Vita](Lil' Mo)
Yo, and I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me baby (ooh)
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80 (yeah)
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
(What would I do?)
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor (oh)
Baby boy we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in july it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never (hmm)
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever (hmm)
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely (lonely)
So baby boy put it on me

Where would I be without you
(Where would I be without you)
I only think about you
(If what you're saying is true)
I know you're tired or being lonely
(I need someone to hold me)
So baby girl put it on me
(I will, I will, I will)
Where would I be without you
(Where would I be without you)
I only think about you
(If what you're saying is true)
I know you're tired or being lonely
(I need you to hold me)
So baby girl put it on me
(Whoa, whoa)

[Ja Rule &amp; Lil Mo]
Since we met it's been you and I
A tear for a tear, baby eye for an eye
And you know that my heart gon cry
If you leave me lonely
Cuz you not just my love you my homie
Who's gonna console me, my love
I'm outta control hold me, my love
Cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world it'd be all yours, baby
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
Cause every thug needs a lady (yeah, yeah)
I feel you baby cause them eyes ain't lying
Wash away all the tears there be no more crying
And you complete me, and I would die if you ain't wit me
So baby girl put it on me
