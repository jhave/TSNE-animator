[Chamillionaire]
I know they gon' get pissed over
This flow that I did for ya
Forget what them tricks told ya
I'm slick with the pistol-a
No purple in his soda..but I'll sell ya the bar
16 bars cost 35 throw a dollar at ya boy
The next nigga that talk down, and say that ballin' rap ain't real
I'ma slap that broke nigga with 10 hundred dollar bills
Then I'ma ask how real is that? and I'ma let you keep the change
Waitress shinin' at IHOP, no tip Owl left you piece and change
Fedarelli think I'm sellin' syrup, swisher sweet and 'caine
But I'm really pimpin' hoes, want head? I'll let you lease her brain
Even hoes try to make me buy them 20 inch tires
Yeah I give them hoes the Visa, but you know that hoes expired
So the card get's rejected
And the braud get's rejected
When she try to get back on my sack, she'll get slapped
money ain't sex it's males and
Females can get it, gettin' money is tough
Cuz I got most of it already, the U.S. didn't print enough
Chamillionaire is no bluff, I ain't have no trouble to sell
Plus I go fed ex like overnight government mail
Thuggin' as well with Thugga-Man
I'm ready to cut a man
Put on my rubber and
Get off in your mother then..
Burn her off my rubber-bands
trunk is cracked
To hell with throwbacks
A nigga throwin' throwbacks back
I'm wearin' throw-ahead jerseys "Koopa what the hell is that?"
A NBA jersey with a College niggas name on the back
He ain't even hit the league, I got em'..in home and away colors
I'm ashamed of this rap game, like the mother's of gay brothers
Yall niggas rappin' gay..and the underground is mine
It's the Mixtape Messiah and I've come to get my crown
Spent yo money on platinum..I put my dough in my mouth
While yall niggas is eatin' cookies stuffin' dough in ya mouth
Even if Rayface recorded all my vocals low
You've got to hear it, I'm the best and you supposed to know
