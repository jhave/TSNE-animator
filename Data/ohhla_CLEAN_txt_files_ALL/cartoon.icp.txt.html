Welcome to Forgotten Freshness Volume 3

Draw something make sure you don't forget your red pen
cause we gonna need it when you draw the blood in
ps-ps-ps-psychopathic records baby all offensive powers
our plane's high-jacked, head for record label towers
drink of choice, Faygo, rock-n-rye with hennesey
i like marijuana that is sent from tennessee
I'm sick of rock guitars always lacin' our shit
we bout to get wicked for the sixth (the sixth), the sixth (the sixth)
I like cuttin' heads off, blood trail through the house
down to the basement where I hollow them out
(???) (???) dont't you reach for the phone
I'm gonna cut you up and voodoo drums with your bones

CHROUS:
Cartoon Nightmares!
Science fiction, brain incision.
Cartoon Nightmares!
Satellites and televisions.
Won't you draw me?
Liquid lines of (technicolor) color.
I will hurry right there.
(walk like an) Egyptian.

Im like Richard Remeriz (the stalker)
and I didn't even know it
Of course I mean without the ACDC and the money
Local Rappers from my city they wanna talk smack
But they be so wack they aint worth dissing back
(Worth Yo (???)) Nope
Break yo head, pull out ya brain
pass it down the line, we call it the train
Look at that girl (2x)
Booty in the pants (2x)
Shakin that thing (2x)
Like WHUT WHUT WHUT WHUT
If you were Andre The Giant, that shit would be slick
You could finger fuck a girl and she would think it's your dick
Blood ozes down the screen
Off the page and magazine
Off the table to the floor
Cross the tile out tha door

CHORUS

ICP headin back to St. Louis
Nelly scoot over, me and shaggy bout to do this
There's an arm in my trunk (Whaa)
An arm in my trunk (Where)
Underneath the tire there's an arm in my trunk
I've seem to recognize this plaaaace
up in county jail
yes I recall, STALE
Me and Jumpsteady killa hookers at night
check my bumper hell if (??????) and blood in the light
Me and Billy Bill, we put a arm in shaggy's trunk
He woulda never noticed, but it stunk soo bad...
There's an arm in my trunk ( HEY YOU)
Gimme a subway bun (Yeaaa)
knuckel deep in mayo like yumm

CHORUS
Cartoon Nightmares, (Walk Like An Egyptian)
Cartoon Nightmares, (Walk Like An Egyptian)
Won't you draw me
Cartoon Nightmares, (Walk Like An Egyptian)
I will hurry right there
Cartoon Nightmares, (Walk Like An Egyptian)
Cartoon Nightmares, (Walk Like An Egyptian)
Cartoon Nightmares, (Walk Like An Egyptian)
Cartoon Nightmares, (Walk Like An Egyptian)
Cartoon Nightmares, (Walk Like An Egyptian)</pre>
