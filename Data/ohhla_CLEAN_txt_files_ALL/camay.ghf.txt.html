What's happenin [love was never born to say, goodbye] what's happenin

(Smokin?) Yeah.
                [just another helpless] We gotta come smokin
                [fool in love is what I am] This is it
(We smoke baby) [just another helpless] another chamber baby
                [fool in love is what I am] slide y'all in

*Cappadon* You know how we do!
 
[Verse One: Raekwon the Chef]
Yo, what's the deal Goldielochs?
Ain't buttin I'm just hibernatin love that watch
Pour me some Scotch and cold Courvoisier out
No doubt, have a chair Boo lets get to pollyin
Who you wit?  Me and Molly and some trick from Yugoslavia
What fabric is that?  It's only woolen Rayon
Lipstick crayon fly, Vere on ice spray on
I'm gettin tipsy, I hope she read cocks like a gypsy
and transport bricks steal in many fifties
Fuck negociatin is you wit me is you waitin
Sweet as carrot cake, fakin plus you don't eat turkey bacon 
I don't get down like that, I don't get down neither
Cuban Linx skeezer, why you actin like a rap teaser
I'm like the jury exchanged plus arranged
Nigga you small change I only fuck with figaro chains
Analyzin Miss Clairol, fendi down mascara on
Assistant manager in Paragon

[Chorus: Teddy Pendergrass]
Say goodbye...
Love was never born to say, goodbye
Love was never born...

[Verse Two: Cappadonna]
Socializin, vibin with my eyes on dot
She this book cover lady that be blowin up the spot
While my heart was racin, like the hands on the clock
I step live I think she see me puttin out the pot
Peace Dot, I'm so happy to see you at the rendezvous
How's life today your hands are softer than Camay
too your hairdo way more class than Halle Berry
Caught visions of me and you ridin on the ferry
Plus your daughter Kiki talk to my man Merry
I order me a Sex on the Beach with the cherry
I order her a Vermidi on ice, sounds nice
She elegant, pretty eyes, glasses, inteligent
Whispered in my ear that she's celibate
Whispered back to her ear we don't have to go there
As I grab the hand set her politely in the chair
As we stopped to stare at one another
Black sister, the brother
I'm thinkin all the time how she could be my lover

[Chorus: Teddy Pendergrass]
Just another helpless
Fool in love is what I am
Love was never born to say, goodbye 
Love was never born to say, goodbye 
Just another helpless
Fool in love is what I...

[Verse Three: Ghostface Killah]
What's happenin brown sugar?  Say you look so good today
Ankle bracelet rapt around your leg 
Here have a seat, complementary drinks is on me
Bartender Chevalier chateaux at table three
Luxurious rings, eyes sparkling
What's your name sugar?  Juanita Cash Hawkins
Your complexion gives a reflection of
sometime a black woman just need to be loved
Quiet and shy, baby girl my gift got you high
Made you wanna hit me with the keys to that file
Just jokin baby, I have a sharp sense of humor
Wish I woulda bumped into your frame a lot sooner
What's your physical degree, thirty one, thirty three
Half Hawaiian with a slight touch of Chinese
Seen you workin at a law firm, on Fifth Avenue
Three blocks from the Gucci spot is where I trapped you
Yo, I'm all into older woman, who's happy livin
Love kids and, keep all up and this in the crib and
not afraid to doubt need a God on your side
We holdin hands til death do us apart and then we slide
Earring in the left side of your nose love my combo
Should have left wizard thousand times maybe tonight though
But you sexy mothafucka DAMN whats the recipe
You make a nigga wanna GOD DAMN
Can you cook darlin, at the stove you're revolvin
Bake macaroni, turkey wings, a nigga starvin
Here take my number let me pull the chair from under
I had fun plus your backyard speak with thunder

[Chorus: Teddy Pendergrass]
Love was never born to say, goodbye (5x)
Just another helpless fool in love is what I am (repeat to fade)</pre>
