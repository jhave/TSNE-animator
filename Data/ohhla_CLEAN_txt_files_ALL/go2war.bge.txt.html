Uhhhhh! 
Ha Ha.  
Big Ed, Full Blooded, and Mystikal.  
Whether it's in the bed with the hoes on these streets we go to war.

[Big Ed]
The battles begun heavy kissing on the front line
Strategic and bout it to explode like a land mine
So you wanna go to war huh
You brought the camoflauge panties and maching bra to get down huh 
Big Ed's a soldier and your a soldierette
Nuclear warhead in the trenches watch to get you hot and wet 
Bet that a war would last as long as Vietnam
Bet that when you cum it will drop like atomic bombs 
Bet that I pack a 50 cal. desert eagle 
That will leave you shaking in the trenches here comes the sequel 
Wondering what the gats and the blitz
Your grenade exploded so many times that you cant believe this
She look at me she swolled 220 and sewed up
&gt;From the size of the monument, chocolate and tatted up
It's going to be war when I hit you
Love to get with you
Strip for daddy now let me take your picture

[Mystikal And Big Ed]
Nah it's time to go to war
Time to go to war whicha
Time to go to war huh
Time to go to war whicha
Go to war with me, right now
Nah it's time to go to war
Time to go to war whicha
Time to go to war
Time to go to war whicha
Go to war with me, right now

[Full Blooded]
I make them niggas wonder 
Would I fuck should I
Could I fuck your old lady
Think I would you must be crazy
I'm a down ass nigga (nigga), dont ask me that
Cuz if I put up in her cat you'll be getting me back
The clock is that 
Don't let them tell you that money dont fuck
Put your trust in a bitch yous a sitting duck
Now peep this nigga peep this, peep this
Challenge my mack 10, I'm knocking you off balance
And its right nigga puttin a fight kill your prey
And a t-shirt go to hell with blood stain
And this TRU so too busy out for your loot
Enough surrounded by the stresses in black suits
Your girl polishes your shoes
Don't be mad you did what you had to do
The nigga died when you passed through
A half played the funeral around the clock
My first stop is the killa to the dangerous spot

[Mystikal And Big Ed]
Nah it's time to go to war
Time to go to war whicha
Time to go to war
Time to go to war whicha
Go to war with me, right now
Nah it's time to go to war
Time to go to war whicha
Time to go to war
Time to go to war whicha
Go to war with me, right now

[Mystikal]
Stop that dance, ohhh
Starting to make me feel like freaky Jason or Marilyn Manson
OK baby you better stop that
The dingaling I swing make me the king topcat
I give my props back but you try to block that
My rock at where you not at, my cock at where your box at
I handled my business I know what you did last summer
You trifling ass bitch I know what you did in that hummer
Now drop yo fucking draws bitch get lowballed crawled
I shut it down mike him with the small tongue
Incoming, I'm cumming, cool, I done told you to
But do you suck dicks are you a peter pumper
Drop yo fuckin self right now mother fucker
Bocka bocka, wacka wacka, blucka blucka
Chucka chucka chucka, I tear that ass up

[Mystikal And Big Ed]
