Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Who bring's it to you
Whoooooohhh

I laid cuts with Jay and rocked rhymes with Run
A couple mil in the bank and I ain't even done
I got platinum plaques, I write platnum tracks
I got it all from raps and that's the platinum face, Uh
All that and there ain't nothing I fear yet
Sippin champagne up in company leer jets
Five star meals, Caribbean vacations
Everything's plush deluxe accomodations
Nationwide, the stations vibe
To the cat who covers tracks like the lace on thighs
My ace is high, there ain't gonna be no guessin
And I'm the illest mother fucker on the block no question
I ain't destined I don't fuck with fate
Self made millionaire while your bussin plates
You see I've already done everything you wanna do
So what makes you think I give a fuck about you

Detroit to Texas
Texas to LA
Who brings it to you
Whooooohh
Who's your uncle?
Brooklyn to the bayou
Across the southern plains
Who brings it to you
Whooooohh
Who's your uncle?

I shot dice with the devil on many occasion
Drank shots with God in an old gas station
A couple accountants, that count my statements
Cribs all paid for, no car payments
Rocked in basements for gas and beer
And now I get all that and big loot to appear
I couldn't steer so I got me a chauffer
Hired a chef cause I was tired of stouffers
I got over and people showed envy
Cause I couldn't choose between a Lincoln and a Benzy
Fendi shades and topless maids
I don't worry about clothes cause thier custom made
I drink crushed up grapes that have been aged for years
Your smokin OP's, drinkin three-two beer
I've already done everything you wanna do
So what makes you think I give a fuck about you
Detroit to Texas
Texas to LA
Who brings it to you
Whooooohh
Who's your uncle?
Brooklyn to the bayou
Across the southern plains
Who brings it to you
Whooooohh
Who's your uncle?

Detroit to Texas
Texas to LA
Who brings it to you
Whooooohh
Who's your uncle?
Brooklyn to the bayou
Across the southern plains
Who brings it to you
Whooooohh
Who's your uncle?</pre>
