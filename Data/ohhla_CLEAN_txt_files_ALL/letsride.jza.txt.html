[Intro: Jadakiss]
World get ready for Josh, N-USA, D-Block
HA-HAH!!!!

[Verse One: Josh Xantus]
5'7 with a light brown eyes
Head to your toe this shorty was fine 
I, walked in and I gave her a smile 
I couldn't rush it depends I have to take my time
And, I couldn't make it so obvious
But this girl caught my eye when she moved the hips
I tried to play really hard to get
But this girl blew my mind when she blew me a kiss

[Chorus: Josh Xantus]
(Now baby girl let's ride!!!) Come and take a ride with me
Sit on the side of my passenger seat
(Now baby girl let's roll!!!) I know your feelin sexy
I wanna take you to my fantasy
(Now baby girl let's ride!!!) Tell your friends you ridin with me
So I can give you everything you need
(Now baby girl let's roll!!!) I know your feelin tipsy
I wanna be your fantasy

[Verse Two: Josh Xantus]
Girl your lookin nice, I drop the top and AMG
We could cruise at night, And no this ain't a room
Got you feelin right, girl you know it, cause you show it
I wanna give you the world, It's your lucky night girl

[Chorus: Josh Xantus]
(Now baby girl let's ride!!!) Come and take a ride with me
Sit on the side of my passenger seat
(Now baby girl let's roll!!!) I know your feelin sexy
I wanna take you to my fantasy
(Now baby girl let's ride!!!) Tell your friends you ridin with me
So I can give you everything you need
(Now baby girl let's roll!!!) I know your feelin tipsy
I wanna be your fantasy

[Verse Three: Jadakiss]
Aiyyo honey lookin real right, body real tight
'Bout to turn a fantasy into real life
Just cause I wanna know what it feels like
You know the first time usually a ill night
After you get it in, good girls swear they never sin
I wanna take her where she never been
Uh, yeah but patience a virtue
We could do the G4 thing or commercial
And I ain't tryin to overexert you 
So we could just chill in the crib, blow purple
Sip San Grier, then I'm a start on your ear
Work my way around to your rear
But now it ain't nothin but love in the air
Killin her from the back I got love in the air
Then I lit a few doves of sour
And make baby girl jump in the shower

[Chorus: Josh Xantus]
(Now baby girl let's ride!!!) Come and take a ride with me
Sit on the side of my passenger seat
(Now baby girl let's roll!!!) I know your feelin sexy
I wanna take you to my fantasy
(Now baby girl let's ride!!!) Tell your friends you ridin with me
So I can give you everything you need
(Now baby girl let's roll!!!) I know your feelin tipsy
I wanna be your fantasy

[Bridge: Josh Xantus]
Grab your bag and let's dip
Girl let's just dip, let's just dip
Take you straight to the whip
Girl to the whip, to the whip
Take you straight to the crib
Girl to the crib, to the crib
I wanna show you girl how I live
Girl how I live, how I live

[Chorus: Josh Xantus]
(Now baby girl let's ride!!!) Come and take a ride with me
Sit on the side of my passenger seat
(Now baby girl let's roll!!!) I know your feelin sexy
I wanna take you to my fantasy
(Now baby girl let's ride!!!) Tell your friends you ridin with me
So I can give you everything you need
(Now baby girl let's roll!!!) I know your feelin tipsy
I wanna be your fantasy
(Now baby girl let's ride!!!) Come and take a ride with me
Sit on the side of my passenger seat
(Now baby girl let's roll!!!) I know your feelin sexy
I wanna take you to my fantasy
(Now baby girl let's ride!!!) Tell your friends you ridin with me
So I can give you everything you need
(Now baby girl let's roll!!!) I know your feelin tipsy
I wanna be your fantasy

[Outro: Josh Xantus]
Now baby girl let's ride!!! Now baby girl let's roll!!!
Now baby girl let's ride!!! Now baby girl let's roll!!!</pre>
