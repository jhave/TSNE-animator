Verse One: Mondo, Vex

I can see your only eyes, locked into your skull
My backbone the zone and when I roam my mind is full
Guess who?  I'm swoopin through the air like pestilence
I know your nerves are shot and skin is tight from my presence
Got the aura of a gazelle and roll like an ox
I linger in the air and make my vocals bust shots
to your dome, I'm thicker than a junkie's nostrils or veins
the membrane, of a party, nucleus of the brain
The cytoplasma, is gettin phatter as it grows
and expansions of the soul so throw the trash below dig within
Your mental will extend upon arrival of the truth the spiritual
ya hear it nigga you'll get loose
So light the wick and let's get busy
Like a stick into your teeth
I override the threshold, and take it back to the sea
Who can it be?  Dance up in the party
Come and grab the microphone, come and move my body

Well I came through the door, I said it before
I never let the stress get me down anymore
So as we walk through the thresholds of snake in the grass
I thought of super vicious shapes, lyrics begin to mass
Feel the blast as the format of the rap smakcs the skit
No profanity but the tongue is rough spit
Verbal vomit, strings the atomic
Some electrospectroscopic storm, rising from the quorum
It's like what?  All up in your grill as we be strokin to the doom
Eliminating gloom as we walk in
With the WalkMan's on, turned up to ten
Apocalypse is comin, Boogiemonsters', transcend
With the
Dan-ne-na, dan-ne-na
Dan-ne-nanny-yah on your block
Rock the ill one for energy, blesses as the mess
Penetrates the thresholds of negative stress

Chorus: Repeat 2X

[Dan-ne-na, dan-ne-na] The recognized thresholds of negative stress
[Dan-nah-nah-neyaa] The recognized thresholds of negative stress

Verse Two: Yodared, Myntric

I like the bare back when I rip my rap on the track
MC's be beggin for mercy, but we don't be cuttin no slack, see
Yoda's on attack and Myntrick got my back
Peep the ver-nacular, cause I don't know how to act

Spectacular, back you up like Dracula
Feedin off the energies, flip em like french toast I be the spatula
My man my blackness, we're, comin through the fatness
The drifter, floatin to the mist of the wackness

Attack us like a virus, look into my iris
Save that Achey Breaky Heart stuff for Billy Ray Cyrus
Just one of four Jugganauts, breakin down the walls
I fall into my zone and I realize all

So bring the noise b-boys, cause we're back
Peep the naked flow, bust the dreaded afro check the track
and plus the microphone, when I take you back
Represent the Boogie Down, moster when the sound hold me black

Chorus:

Verse Three: Vex, Mondo

Well it's the taker of the took-en, the shaker of the shook-en
My head will bop and rock like the niggaz bop in Brooklyn
on the block, so you don't stop
And ya don't stop when I rock and the nine goes pop

Remember me, I be the kid with the Catholic uniform
But nowadays, ahh, the girlies just swarm
I don't know why, I'm walkin through the negative stress
Ghinga levi, is use-ful and still may get the thresh

Well I'm that little peasy-headed kid from back in the day
The one that could run fast, cut and go the other way
and run a three-eight forty, leave ya in the chills
Leave ya at the twenty standin still holdin ya dillz

I used to get frustrated with my Nike's
It never matched my wears, I used to be in tears
I used to be chillin, I used to roll dice
Nowadays I'm thrillin, my wears are twice as nice

And nice on the rhyme flip, watch how my rhyme tip
Just gets more complex, as we come, let me say my name is Vex
Fe fi fo fum, ho hum, yes I said it, before
But bring it in, Mondo, my man cause he got more

One day I be the rich and famous sittin in my Nova
Scoopin chicks, gettin chicks, to flip like bend over
Got my powerful, ice-ring, and everybody's witness
and the swing techniques, so flow you fly freak

So in ninety-four, yo, it's all about the music
Here it comes, spiritually, now you can, use it
So ah, eliminate the worst and the best
And eliminate the threshold, of negative stress
