Yo THIS is for my Ninjas
REAL ninjas
Who ain't afraid to get loony

Get LOONY!
Get up BITCH!
Get Loony

Pull it out snap it in, let me begin
Cut under the chin fresh out the loony bin
You don't want me to act up, punk you'd better back up
Swingin my axe everybody gets hacked up

Get up, stand up, bloodying my hands up
Can't control the feelin' here I come a wig peelin
I can chop a hater up even though I'm drunk
Yo, I'll stab 'em in the eye and then I'll take the punks home

Freak show, funk it, bodies in the trunk'in
Pullin drive by on the cops at a dunkin'
Donuts shop, My hatchet goes chop
Guts hit the floor and I'm losin it but I won't stop
I came here to clown, I came here to clown
Lets get lunatic and jump around!

Jump around
Jump around, jump up and down like a clown

GET LOONY

Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump
Jump,

GET LOONY

Jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump,

GET LOONY

I'll serve your ass like a rabid chef
If your girl steps up, I'll stab her to death
Word to your mother, A scrub from the gutter
That'll cut through your neck, hot knife to butter

I turn the moon off and dance in the darkness
Choke the life, right up out of your carcus
I got sick jokes for you, there not fun
Fuck you in the ass with a shotgun

I plead insanity, ' and shout to the death
Had to muster WOO with my last breath
Tell me to Chill.. I don't think I will
'Cause when I shoot the shit, I shoot to kill

I came here to clown, I came here to clown
Lets get lunatic and jump around!

Jump around
Jump around, jump up and down like a clown

GET LOONY

Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump

GET LOONY

Jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump
Jump,

GET LOONY

I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig but I eat pig slop
I swing a chainsaw through the brains and all
Veins and jaws, sip it all through a straw

But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one torture and yo then Im like SWITCH!
Then up up and around buck buck it down
Put your head up and you wake up in the dawn of the dead
I'm comin to get ya, My hatchet'll split ya
Twist off your head and snap a picture with ya
They found ya in a ditch and said you're a bitch ya
Just like me it was the rythem that hit ya

I came here to clown, I came here to clown
Lets get lunatic and jump around!

Jump around
Jump around, jump up and down like a clown

GET LOONY

Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump

GET LOONY

Jump, jump
Jump, jump,
Jump, jump,

GET LOONY

Dedicated to the FBI
In the ballsack
PUNKS
From the juggalos
