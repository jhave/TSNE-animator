[Verse One]
I've been patient
I've been a mental patient
I've been a parental replacement for kids sent to the basement
A has been
I've been had
I've become best friends with a pen and pad
Understanding the logic of an inadament object
Standing in the projects with a sign around my neck
Sayin' "Show Me My Respect!"
They thought it was a setup
Upset
I've been unusual
I've been an unusual, suspect
You're beautiful
Just check to make sure that you're musical
One sec
I'll be back in a minute
React to the limit and butt out if your ass is up in it
Ask if you can kick I say "No you may not. 
Cause your flow just ain't hot."
So you bust a straight shot
"Fuck the fuck do they got?"
Watch your mouth, what that kid say?
Sucka lied, no doubt, hit by the ricochet
Kids today, I just don't trust 'em
When I have mine
I'ma make him speak in rhymes, he'll think that it's custom
I'll tell him, "Daddy's Muslim" every Christmas
So on December 25th he'll be giftless
Then I'll convince this dumbass he's actually a Witness of Jehovah
Flip mad scripts til he's older
Have him bring fat chicks on over
Give 'em drinks if they're sober
We'll make some noise soon
If she stinks of an odor
Send her to my boy's room
This is my house, you don't like it, get the fuck out
Cause under my roof you live by my rules, son
I make you wanna bounce

[Chorus]
Bounce
Sage Francis makes you wanna 
Bounce
Joey Beat's beats makes you wanna
Bounce
Mythical, Non-Prophets
Whether it be concepts or battle rhymes I shatter minds
Bounce
The Secret Service crew
Bounce
What do all balls do?
Bounce
Mythical, Non-Prophets
If you're jumpin' up and down right now stop it

[Verse Two]
I've made a man mad
I've been a mad man
I've been a goodie two shoes who walks barefooted in a bad land
I've been to Mattapan
What's up to my Boston heads
I came to visit y'all but you know me, I got lost instead
I toss in bed
Keep myself awake at night
Worried that I might not fall asleep until I see the light
My friends wanna see me fight cause I'm a black belt karate master
I'd rather have my freestyle raps help the party's laughter
Plus I'm out of shape and haven't trained in months
Count the amounts of time my face has been punched
I feel my cranial lumps
Say thee old chump, "I'll F you up!"
Cross your mind language with sign language, is y'all def/deaf or what?
"Do you mean the D.E.A.F. kind?"
He must have read my lips so hard he was left blind
I've never been signed but I've been signed off
Cause I never rhyme soft or wore designer cloth
Every time I cough
I swear to God that it's a cardiac arrest
Feel my chest
Make sure it's not a heart attack
I'm stressed
It's rest that I probably lack
And yes, I'm a full fledged, over the edge hypochondriac
Obsessed
With cleaning the rims on my Pontiac
Rollin' through the plaza askin' where the party's at
Tellin' Hardy's hat they're hardly fat
But couldn't all be wack
To get him violent like a lush wanting his car keys back
My wife don't want me back I want to hold her
It's a shame, she ain't been the same ever since I told her
"This is my house. You don't like it get the fuck out.
Cause under my roof you live by my rules bitch."
She said I had to bounce

[Chorus]
Bounce
Sage Francis makes you wanna 
Bounce
Joey Beat's beats makes you wanna
Bounce
Mythical, Non-Prophets
Whether it be concepts or battle rhymes I shatter minds
Bounce
The Secret Service crew
Bounce
What do all balls do?
Bounce
Mythical, Non-Prophets
If you're jumpin' up and down right now you missed the topic
