[Lil Wayne]
God Damn
Nix gonna hit a nigga in his head with this one
I'm a paint the city red with this one
I'm ahead with this one
See you fucking with the boy with two toys way before Christmas
No assistance just
that persistance with
that commitment if
I don't get it somebody gonna die tonight
I know my vibe is tight
and I deserve the throne and if the kid ain't right
then let me die on this song
See I be riding just riding alone
With my daddy on my mind like you gotta be kidding
How the hell you ain't here to see a prince do his thing
somtimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king
Shall be
So I be who I be
That's me
That's Weezy F Baby and
Please say the motherfucking
So I be who I be that's me
That's Weezy F Baby and
Please say the motherfucking

[Hook]
Baby you gotta know
I'm just out here doing what I gotta do for me and you
and we eating
so bitch why the fuck is you trippin'
I'm taking these chances
My head to the sky
My feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge if the money don't move
Then I won't budge won't budge
No I won't budge no
Lord

[Lil Wayne]
Money is the motivation
Facing the avenue
Back touching the wall
Got the weed got the gun
Gotta run when I hear the bird call (Dad)
Hop in that thing and merk off
Swerve off
You know me they call me Birdman Junior
Anybody murderer if Birdman sponsor it
Phantom of the Oprah
All black crop tent locked in
I can let them shots out
you can't get no shots in
Bulletproof
Leave a nigga with a bullet-roof
Shoot ya' in your mouth Leroy
They call him bullet-tooth
I'm like
What it do What it do
There's a full court pressure
I'm just going for the two
If I'm open for the three
I'm a take it in a second
Even if theres one second
I'm a make it it's nothing
I don't take it for granted
I don't take it for nothing
I'm a take it for what it's worth
to the dirt motherfucker
Yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't never killed nobody I promise
And I promise if you try me he goin' have to rewind this track
And make me go back
That thing will go ratttttttt
That boy will lay flat
So flat that
Act is what I preform amongst you haters
Got Nina in my palm and I'm masturbating
Black Peter Pan fly till I die, what you saying
Bathing Ape, Eve Saint, Evisu what I stay in
And got me feeling like Scarface
Like the Cohiba
Streets reply I look right in a four-seater
You know I be out here right in a four-seater
Top Floor of the four seasons
Four of them whores
And they all know how to cook it up
and look I got some
And only one know how to bag
Bitch bundle up
See it's a cold world
So homie bundle up
We ain't on this grind for nothing
So get your hustle up
