Oh, Uh, Uh, Let's go, Uh, Uh

[Verse: Timbaland]
Hey yall, it's Timbaland with the jump off
I only got forty eight hours before my plane takes off
I got this girl ready to give me some face off
I think I need seven just to make the playoff
But I ain't gonna hit tonight, I'ma leave a good impression before I catch my flight (come on)
How I'm wrong when you ain't right?
When your dumbass will be right on my flight (stupid)
There goes my shenanigans, laugh with me
There ain't no need for panicking
Chill out, you on a private plane
Just lay your head back to this kirkle bang
Eat some peanuts, sip on some champagne
Your fly mileage go up as you give me brain
This is what Thomas do, piss on my mark then I get back to you

[Chorus] x2
Cause I'm leaving on the next plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Why don't you just call up all your friends
And let's get something started

[Verse: Attitude]
I'm only in town for two days, two nights only
I'm hoping that you wanna spend these two nights on me
I like your home girls you like my homies
We ain't really tryna spend these two night lonely
Shawty, really ain't much I'm asking for
A little conversation, a nice piece of ass to go
I like penetration, how you like it fast or slow?
Only a hip, nobody has to know
She looking at me, weighing up her options
She ready to leave, and go get it poppin'
What could be the fact that I got there
Drop top Benz or that single in the top 10?
I dunno but whatever it is gottacrunk
She grabbing her liquor, coming out of Prada
I told her I'ma pimp it, I ain't coming out a dollar
Let's go! I'm leaving gonna be out of here tomorrow

[Chorus] x2

[Verse: Magoo]
Girl you lookin' right in those jeans
You been eating colligreens?
That's obscene, your man don't help you make beans?
You have a house, 2 kids, and he working
There's rumors, he and your best friend been flirting
But I ain't tryna fuck you tonight
Your ass big, but your face hmmmm that look alright
I tell you what, I'ma make an exception
Clothes off, that's the truth
Clothes on is deception
Aw, yea, a macilent conception
Front or the back, hit in any direction
And baby you the cause of my erection
Stop at Wal-Greens I'ma buy some protection
Fuck that, go and put it in my face girl
I really have a need to give you face girl
You said you dreamed if sex with a star
Make up your mind, Oo be on a jet tomorrow

[Chorus] x2</pre>
