Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yo
I'm gettin older now
23 years old and half of me just wants to make the move and go and settle down
The other half's like, "Hell no, you better mess around
Don't let me down, especially when you got an album comin' out"
When I first saw you, I'm like "Aw shit, goddamit look what God did. Hail Mary Jesus!"
Three years later I'm sittin' in our apartment
thinkin' about all the places that my heart's been
I mean it's crazy right?
This is maybe wife [?] - the one that found me in a drought
pulled me out and made me right
Through the ups and downs we stuck it out and now you're leavin' town
Another couple thousand miles south, which leads to crazy fights
[Phew]
And I don't know how to deal with it, I gotta be real with ya
Uh
Each day I get filled with the - feelin' of realer love, I wanna continue, what
But, bhis ain't the same old love song
cause we been through the depths where all the trust is gone
For months on end all we have is phone calls
What

You know what makes it worth it?
To watch someone progress
To have them watch you
Someone that you respect and value and cry to
It's something so comforting cause it could bring so much truth
But then magic can be stagnant and the relationship doesn't move
The commitments to yourself
And that you're always learning
to acknowledge you're both perfect and still wanna keep working
To progress as a person but as an individual entity
and then come together as a unit but still maintain that identity
It sounds so elementary but it's so complex
it's the most delicate balance to get away from attachments
But it could work
I'm attemptin' it
Nah, we're livin' it
To keep defining and redefining what love and commitment is
Sing that, come on

Every time I can't ignore you
Every time I come around I see your face always movin'

Yo
Just workin on dependency
Sometimes the thing you love the most in this world you just gotta let it be
It hurts to have to set it free
And if it does, it doesn't work we both know that it was meant to breath
Can't hide from experiences
And there's so many people out there in this world were gonna find interestin'
It's only a matter of time before that right connection
Thousands of miles away, whatchu expect?
You see I'm wonderin' where are you?
Tearin' the label off of a beer as I'm sittin at this barstool
You would tell me not to call you, to never use you as a fall through
To sit with my emotion, but the lump in my throat builds as the heart rips open up
And not even your voice alone can shift to go and close it shut
So I just let it flow through me
Feelin' lifted from the spirit like the bag in American Beauty
And if your life truly flashes in front of you
when you die just know the best time of my life has been lovin' you
I love you, you know
Let's get em, c'mon

We been together but in my head
We would break apart; I would hold my heart, tied inside
But you knew that my soul could not be given to anybody easily
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
(Ohhhhhhh yeah)
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh

It's a beautiful thing isn't it?
One more time Ev

Every time I can't ignore you
(Feels good don't it?)
Every time I come around I see your face always movin'</pre>
