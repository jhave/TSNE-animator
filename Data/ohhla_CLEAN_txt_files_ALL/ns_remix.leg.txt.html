"Revenge!"

[Luckyiam.PSC]
I'm on top of this
Still bird's eye viewin' it
A lot of motherfuckers in this business ain't true to it
Slid 'em a single
Yes it wasn't major
And we still ain't gettin' no love by player haters (Fat Beats)
Fool we ain't ballin'
We just rip shows out of the country while you fallin'
Standin' strong and clown silly hoes
If you don't know who we is by know you'll never know

[MURS]
Most got the bump but what?
We got the slump niggas sellin' these tapes
Till I can dump figures down on my laptop
Laptop stay by me
Yes I'm bout the benjamins
But never assemble them 
In amounts more than ten Gs
Government satellites pick that shit up
Throw you on their TVs
Yes the metal strip, you thought they did it
To stop counterfeit
How they gonna put my ass out a job?
I jog cougar
RPC competition with the KF7 Soviet
Opponents get ripped inside of the basement
Chasin' down the wrong corridor
How many times?
Do the Legends go into 64 
Eight
More MCs 
Master Citizens
Slaughterin' buzz
You get plugged like live and direct from the Truman Show
A human though
Homo superior 
My syonic energy overwhelms thee inferior

"Revenge"

[Eligh]
Withering syllables spring lifeless
Timeless satirical laughter at your style 
Is screwed, failed to move the crowd
Serial digits
Been scratched off the wagon
So the dust becomes your company
Title "Some MC"
Rival enemies loud
Enemy cracks
? doesn't stat the facts 
So lax
Down to the deepest part of tax
Repeat the slack off
Let my reality slump
Without the bass
The mist they jack off
Float so endless in this time and space
Disgrace
In innovative excitement takes place
Energy level's low
Don't get the concept 
Reaping what you sow
So, the final blow
Remainders angered at the cost
Toss their luck to perfect strangers
But this pro won't take a loss

[Asop]
Virtually, the whole meaning of fresh rests within
The music that we blend in the background
Sounds tight
Yeah tight
Tighter than your show that we ripped up last night
Fight for your chance to evolve, I'll call your name out
You'se about a bitch ass
No rhymin' rapture 
Bout to get big off some wack shit, it'll never work
While I'm tellin' you
You better listen boy
Or you get rushed
Cup the mic like them other toys
While the beat's slumpin'
These niggas sayin' somethin' intelligent
Relevant to the elegant math have you highly out classed

[The Grouch]
Pressurized writing 
Skills igniting, thrill feeling from the inside 
Bring the slump quick ride
I'm sittin' on vinyl doin' donuts on the table when they go nuts
And I'm stable otherwise I'm insecure
But
Just a little bit, I spit it and get cocky
Geeks and weirdos jock me
Help me clock these zeros
These big ideas I draw close, saw
Most of y'all was peepin'
I came raw no flaws
A little if any
I'm not riddled to skinny
The pots there for the takin' who's slump is earthquakin'?
Makin' decisions my vision is too broad for that
Fuck just respect, I make you wanna applaud my raps
And ain't no dogs or gats
Makin' noise here
I'm poised, fear the sense it made
Call your defense brigade

"Revenge!"

[Sunspot Jonz]
These motherfuckers!
Is underground with no freestyle
Freestyles with no style
I'm smakin' cream pies
Trackin' curly fries 
Tryin' to french fry their way to the top of the cherry pie
Fools is slimy 
Like 106
Smoke a beadie and chill
Pray your chicken ass, the industry don't kill
4001 ways to kill your ass
Still the Legends
With mass appeal 
When underground tapes will end up deep
Producing ? see through poetic words a still leak
Like time after time
Every line you say you can't back up
Blow your track up 
You signed and wack as...fuck
Like airplane food
Brussels sprouts and ?
I'm gumbo and crawfish
Living words yellow back mule
Punk DJ
You're on the dick of your commercial radio station play
Everything but locals say
Run around and ask about some underground, love
Let's put on some boxing gloves
Gerry Cooney
I'm Julio Chavez
Body blow body blow
Awe yeah
I took a Rittlin and still in
And you bite so much you used to be thinner
There was a sinner 
It's a girl beginner
You're an evil captain
Penetratin' my shit up
Cause I keep my ear to the ground

[Bicasso]
Ha ha ha
Check out my Bizarre-o
So now some of you might be wondering 
What is this beat bumpin' 
This so called slump thing?
What I mean is
There's a million and four reasons so get with it
If it passed you up on the charts, we might just quit it
Shit, I mean spit it
At a show for the true fans
Or spin it on the radio while you scratch with your two hands
But this disc jock
Be commanding respect 
And if you ain't got service yet 
Then you best to go out and get it
Shit

"Revenge"

Where you goin' where you goin'
