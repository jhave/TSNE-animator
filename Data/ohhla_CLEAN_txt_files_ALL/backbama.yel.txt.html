Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Goin' back to bama, gonna take it nice and slow
Goin' back to bama, wanna see some ? roads
Take it easy Alabama and I watch my babies grow

Goin back
Alabama

Yeah I'm comin' home to my shepards lair and I'm a ride along
I'm coming round, to this old bridge and this small town
and I'm a cross this river bed, and bring every body I know
and I'm a show them the best side of this rebel flag that people hold
My cousin told me don't forget where you come from
Every boy I want I promise, how could I run from
What become so strong, a part of my childhood
where nothing could cheer me up like the thought of home and the wild woods

I hold up the name, cause we been through it all
I'm not afraid of change when Daddy said he'd do it all
I just shook his hand well maybe you're wrong
cause I found the whole world when I found my song in Alabama

Goin' back to bama, gonna take it nice and slow
Goin' back to bama, wanna see some ? roads
Take it easy Alabama and I watch my babies grow

Yes sir, I'm going to back bama with a bit of that jack
shotgun rested on the gun rack give me 20 bucks
and a six shot and I come back with a mobile and a 6 pack
Catfish billy got a piece of that pie, pie tell me do you want some of that?

Take my hand Dixie land, if you wanna rise, then I will stand
Hold my hand Dixie land I know your drive, I understand</pre>
