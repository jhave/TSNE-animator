[Chorus]
So can I get a price check, yeah can I get a price check
on your life and the side effects
Of the money, the greed, the debt, the schemes
Check one two, check two three
Get a mic check, yeah can I get a mic check
Derapht coming live and direct
from the West to the South, to the North to the East
Check one two, check two three

[Verse 1]
Mmmm man my mother was never made of the money
Iron maiden never running away from her sons and
daughters, always had food and water
Never knew how she afforded my Jordan's but bought em'
I wore them till water, would leak through the rips
Never looked poor like Oliver Twist, never wanted more
or knock on your door like I was a Mormon
Swore to never be down or caught in a rip
Ha, when money came it was gone with the wind
On a shopping list longer than the Lord of the Rings
Ha, a sunny day you ain't short of a thing
When ya born into a game holding four of the kings
Yeah believe it, my dad was a musician
But bringing a bass drum to cook up in the kitchen
wouldn't feed us, with all his get rich scheming
Feeding his deamons, life's a bitch
To sky rocket he forgot all the people in his locket
For a profit, leave another man rotten
Notes in his pocket nailed in his coffin
cos yesterday's pain ain't forgotton

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I knew this girl you would sell your soul for
She would control your world like the Cold War
No dole form, sworn from the riches erection
Oh you gotta rex or a Lexus
And this temptress gives you attention
Hence all you have to do is mention the money
It's like sex; you got none, you want it
Now she's all up in your wallet for the money so

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Was always taught that the root of evil
is he who steals from the pocket of his people
Eagle eyed survive in the dark
Ravenous sharks, welcome to the business
Oh I live this, knocked off the hinges
Our offspring addicted to syringes of money
Axe wilding civillian children kill for
some Paris Hilton million dollar money
Some of these kids live the sunniest life
Still running from the law like Bonnie and Clyde
Still deal, still pedaling pills and rock
Steal for what? You got all the dollar bills you want
It makes the world go round, it makes the world go
It makes the girls go down, it makes the girls go
It makes the world go round, it makes the world go
It makes the girls go down

[Chorus]</pre>
