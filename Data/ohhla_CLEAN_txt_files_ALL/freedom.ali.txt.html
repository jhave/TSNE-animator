[Hook]
Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free

[Verse 1]
If I don't like my life I gut it and rebuild it
Fuck it keep nothing but God and my children
I kill the devil wherever he resides
Even if he hiding in me he got to die
I killed little Jason he was only fifteen
Sewed his good traits together made Ali
Filled his lungs with the Qur'an until he breathed
Let him walk but kept him on a short leash
Here he stand now seventeen year old man child
Ain't asked nobody for a mother fuckin hand out
He trying to carry heaven on his back
Jumped the broom with a stranger ain't never look back
What he know about how the world spin?
Bless his heart he a virgin never even had a girlfriend
Want to be a man so bad that he can taste it
His family fell apart and he trying to replace it
You'll find in him a heart that's second to none
But I know also that his lessons ain't done so
I stand willing to kill him again
If to grow he got to shed his skin then let it be done

[Chorus/Hook]
Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord
Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free
You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free

[Verse 2]
One half of all the two legged's on the scene
Are too timid to dream cos failure is far too depressing it would seem
so they take whats given
Thats your decison I just don't consider that living
If I'm to die whether or not I try
I might as well let the dice fly
I'm hot knife through butter in the night's sky
It shouldn't take a genius to see this hunger in my eye
So I use blood and sweat to butter my bread
Cos this cold world couldn't give a fuck if I'm fed
I ain't curled up in my bed
If I don't set the world ablaze trust it ain't cos of nothing I did
Listen I dont think God's obligated to touch you
If your ass would rather live in shit than work a shovel
I refuse to let the sun set on me again
Til' the end I'm a one man army, friend

[Chorus/Hook] {x2}
Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord
Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free
You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free</pre>
