Song:   Ain't No Sunshine
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

Ain't no sunshine cause she's gone
I'm lonely cause she's away

My girl is gone and I can't fight sadness
How in the world can I stand this madness?
I thought it was love, supposed to last for ages
Now the book of my life's missin pages
Baby, I'm always faithful and truthful
Keep you smilin, happy and youthful
But now that you're gone ain't nobody to kiss me
I'm sittin here wonderin how much you miss me
I ask myself why, but I still can't answer
If all I tried to do was love and romance ya
Show you the right way, then why is it wrong?
But all I get is the words to this song

Ain't no sunshine cause she's gone
I'm lonely cause she's away

I been missin you for weeks and weeks
And my heart can't stand no more pains and leaks
Dreams and fantasia rush my mind
I feel like I'm movin backwards in time
I never look at your picture, cause I can't stand
To think of you never comin back to your man
When we made love in the whirlpool I looked in your eyes
That's when you cried
And said if I left you you'd probably die
But now you're gone and I don't know why
Baby, come back to me, I'll never leave you
Hurt you in any way, girl, and deceive you
I wish there was a way, I'm tryin to be strong
But all I get is the words to this song

When you was around I was always smilin
With you on my arm I was always stylin
Never ashamed of you, take you anywhere
Ex-girls were jealous, but I didn't care
A lady in many was and also smart
I had no other choice but to open my heart
You always took care of me and kept me fed
And even at night when we laid in the bed
You kissed me on my neck, then I hold you head
And we made lovef all night
It was over, I kept you till the morning sunrise
Kiss you on your lips, then you close your eyes
I never left, so I stayed and kept you
Watched you sleep cause I had to protect you
Everything about you, girl, made me strong
But since you been gone...

Ain't no sunshine cause she's gone
I'm lonely cause she's away</pre>
