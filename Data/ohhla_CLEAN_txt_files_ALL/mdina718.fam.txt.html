[Dreddy Kruger]
3G shit, 3G shit
John the Baptist, bitch
3G shit, 3G shit
Dark Denims, where you at?
Dark Denims, where you at?
Timbuktu, one-two
Dreddy Kruger, New York
One-two, one-two
Yo, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah
2G shit, 3G shit, one-two, one-two (Yo)

I can't see a thing, but I care
A mouse piss on cotton, my style is rotten
Spoiled by bets who Protect they Necks
Do the knowledge to the mathematical slang that's handsome
Funny hot dogs get played at the speed of fast forward
For comin toward me with that bullshit, I'm from Bushwick
718, get it straight
I slap the shit outta you with your own fuckin tape

[Timbo King]
Ocean Hill, Brownsville...
2G shit, 3G shit
Buildin 1524
2G shit, 3G shit

Yo, who wanna rock mics?
I stop mics, pull out plugs
Cuz thugs don't perform on stage they rob clubs
Take yo' drink money, yo' bitch mink money
You think you're funny? My team got rich and cunnin
Lionel Richie money, Dancin on the Ceilin
We high off a chief-13, beer spillin
Walk through the V.I.P., we know the bouncers
Sweet pussy Pauline, smilin, slingin ounces
Jew-els shinin off the strobe lights, gleamin
DJ biggin us up, while niggas' schemin
Party to the end of ninety-nine
I got ninety-nine niggas with ninety-nines
Power refined, it takes me an hour to rhyme
Way past my wiz, quality time, I'm pollyin mine
Strike in the middle, I shoot it through a cylinder
Pin-point accuracy, one dart dillinger

[Dreddy Kruger] (Timbo King) <both>:
