[Method Man]
Apocalypse Now
Mind over matter next batter be Tical
Put it on a platter how much uncut
raw shit we dealin wit, murder track what
Slang killin it, touched
You feelin it, in your bloodstream
deadly venemous elixir
Hammer like Sledge that be Sister
All and together now, follow me, the Mista
Meth Candyman, farewell to the flesh
Death come, in the scripture, two-thousand one
Bring the rap arma-gedde-on, let it be known
When you walk up in this Dead Zone
wit all that wack shit, now you know
you dead wrong, one thousand lashes

[Raekwon the Chef]
Detonate that, pussy Massengil rap cleanse that
The kids rank, snatch collars off, while ridin off
Float boat big boys, Oakland A's stashed away blades
Ventilation let the sharks, ani-maze
Somethin sheist like, seven butcher knives, rollin Rover style
twice, finger itchy like lice hair fell out somethin
to conquer, stomp ya like that cat Blanca
Toy Tonka truck ten carat on ya monsta
Ring Rocky like fuck switch sides like water rides
The DAT bubble life preserve the other guys
Now FUCK Y'ALL act wilda
The style wilda than a praying mantis
Chillin like *long inhale*

[Masta Killa]
As my brothers and I reign rebellious, changin
the courses of time, devils no longer exist
as God Cypher Divine, all minds one no question
Now check it...
Perhaps we can go through Lessons
Or might SHOT me a pussy protestin
Comin with that lip professin, you must take
Allah for fool, where's his Jewel
Was he usin Mathematics as a tool?
Tell me, the struggle is God and I came to build
Shit is so real, inside you distilled
Back in the form of mist
You wishin you did the Knowledge before speakin
Seekin, where you went wrong
And why would I bring you such physical harm?

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, mind arson, my squadren, surround the Sound-Garden
Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
Sniper in the cypher, I, Pied Piper
Move the housing by the thousand, I watched out the Chrysler
Bombs strike ya like the mighty Thor, blast the door
Recite a page like a tidal wave, past the shore
Two pulls, I'm wild like mechanical bulls
Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a hairful
Heavenly laced, stimulation make you feel slow paced
I motivate and await my sober state

[Ghostface Killah]
Magnificent, heavenly the God stay bent
Five Percent Range whippin soul controller of the lynch
Mackin phone rings, Stephen King trauma down at Danzine
My mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine
Coconut jewels, wore no color shoe, knife annual
Moses lost his sandal, hidin the manual
Blow the vandal buggin off of Bon Jovi hits
Grammer lo-ve, famous murder weapon was a trophy
Seize posin in Oshkosh, guzzle cries
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large
Wolverine Carnation Milk, Wu denim jeans
Thurston Howell the Third kid's back on the scene
Call it chopped meat, cause every word is choppy
My logic crunch all crows to death, Kobiyashi couldn't stop me
Gettin caught up in my world, Haagen-Daaz world
Backflip and then twirl, cave your whole world in
*gun blast*
