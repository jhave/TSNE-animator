[Adreena Mills]
Doesn't really get this cold in the summer
Doesn't really get this dark in the day
Boy they really turn they backs when you're talkin
When they lay somebody else's head where you lay
Though they find it easy to be hard
I find it even harder to be easy
You know sometimes I close my eyes and I wonder
If I ever left how much you'd miss me
Ohhh somebody told me, blood was thicker than water
If a man can say that he can recognize his own daughter
And if, hell is below would you pay the price to go
Then I can make it to heaven for sure

[Chorus 2X: Adreena Mills]
Cause this is a cold worrrrrld, cold worrrrrrld
Ohhh - if we make it this way
Ohhh - but we don't like it this way

[DMX]
WHAT! ... WHAT! ...
Cats don't know what they say when they talkin
So I just let a nigga say what he feel
Fuckin with the kid they gon' end up in a coffin
Cause I'ma say what I gotta say with the steel
Niggaz hatin cause I had a job
I know it's they job to be hatin
I'm a dog so I don't fuck with cats (nah)
Cause they gon' have me livin in the state pen'
'til 'bout time I reacted (yeah!)
Look at what y'all did to this rap shit (what!)
Knowin niggaz is wrong, c'mon with the cat shit (c'mon!)
Wack shit, get niggaz tore down, slapped quick
BLAM, BLAM, BLAM! Go down, that quick
Actin, like the, truth is gone
Had 'em say, y'all deal with the, ruthless one
This two-piece, leave your faggot ass toothless son
I go hard, "Dog don't do it!" Too late, it's done
Hold up~! I'ma show you why Dog is the illest, kill this
You might not catch it, but you'll feel this (yeah!)
The realest nigga that ever do it
The realest nigga to ever go through it
And y'all gon' bring me back to it! (woo!)
Y'all gon' make me, lose my mind (yeah!)
Middle name is grind, came from crime
Thought I would change with time? Niggaz don't know me
Let your man hold somethin, you ain't got it? Nigga show me

[Chorus]

[Adreena Mills]
The tunnel looks brighter from behind
but you gotta keep movin (movin) movin (movin)
Because if life stops spinnin in the right direction
who's losin (losin) losin (losin)
See in the night, I pray to keep me breathin
To see another day to give 'em somethin to believe in
Cause I know it won't always be this way
when you're tryin hard to make a change
