Verse 1:

Uh, fool sittin' all fat brat tat tat tat (bitch and its like that)
Well let me lift you to the sky
Just climb aboard the B-R-A-T ride
Those with no love I stay about like GOD
Quick to pull ya trigga nigga quick to pull ya card
And it don't stop and it don't quit
In ninety-fo I be the sho shot shit
And in years to come shit ain't gonna change

Verse 2:

Well yo, I ain't no joke never have never will be
Down your whole block you can feel me
All I do is keep fucking it up
The doper my shit the bigger my come up
Now tell me have you ever heard a female vocalist
Swift like this that kick shit like this?
I don't think so, I don't think you know
No hoe that can flow like I flow
And plus if you like it rough and rugged then you love it
Play it say it day to day you never ever get enough of it (WOOOOOOO)
Ain't I ridiculous its dat bad mamma jamma
