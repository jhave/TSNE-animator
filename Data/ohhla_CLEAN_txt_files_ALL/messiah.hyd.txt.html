*sample*
She sits on the window sill
Looking down it's quite a thrill
In the tree
Imagining what it is like to be dead
She walks on the ledge
Searching for the living end

[Mr. Hyde]
Mr. Hyde your messiah Necro on production brain abduction. Check it

[Chorus]
Your messiah's arrived prepare to fire your nines
Make up your mind and decide if you desire to die
By the tyrant of knives it's Mr. Hyde and I thrive
To put you dead in the dirt death acquired your cry

[Mr. Hyde]
I'm the scourge of the earth I've been a merchant since birth
The devil bobs his head to this the detergents of hurt
One insult is all it takes and my blade assaults your face
I'm feasting on sheep like the ape in Altered States
You can til I'm rolling hard til my nine explodes and charge
I'm giving broken arms like I practice yoda con
I'll blast your cabbage on nuthin near your average scar
Leave you for the scavengers a martyr with your salvage on
My evil slang consists I'm from the latin languages
Vanquish you with bangers after strangle you with blankets kid
Take a piss on you bitch and then I'll lace you with phlegm
Foul like Malaki and Howie puffin base behind a shem
Leavin you with belly pains headin into hell with chains
Beat the elderly with canes til I see their smelly brains
You're seekin to live because you're dreamin it kids
See what the sandman will bring ain't what the demons will give

[Chorus]

[Mr. Hyde]
It's Hyde the dream caster hide disease catcher
Receiving the rash exceed and breath cancer
Your pain's expected fuckin major wreckage
When I blaze my tech kid it'll cave your chest in
My blades connected with your face and left it
Greatly twisted gotta pay to fix it
I'll stick you through your scarf leave your neck with bloody scars
Gettin hectic like a baby fallin off the monkey bars
Anthem shreddin ya'll stuff myself til my lungs bleed
The jungle predator son I'll hunt better hungry
Dedicated to sins like separating your limbs
Desecrating your skin by decorating with pins
You're undressing confession gettin fucked by a priest
Ain't no rosary beads will have you touchin his peace
You keep on steppin to me you'll be receiving some props
I'll let my weapon release and now you're bleeding a lot

[Chorus]
