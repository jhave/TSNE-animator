We're all gonna die 

When I was a very young boy, mamma told me we all gonna die 
Mamma said son love can't be trusted, it's just another weakness 
We all gonna die 

Chorus 

Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie, 
We're all gonna die 
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie 
We all gonna die 

Now I'm grown, seen a lot livin', made a few friends 
Gonna get high, hoping I don't take more than I'm given 
Judgement day comin', we all gonna die 
If my wings should fail me lord, meet me with another pair 

Chorus 

Baby getting born, old man die'n 
Young lady laughn', old woman cryin' 
Leaving like a lamb, comin' back like a lion 
Babylon to Zion, we're all gonna die 

Praise the most high, we're all gonna die 
When I was a very young boy Mama told me, we're all gonna die 
Mama said, son, love can't be trusted 
Its just another weakness, we're all gonna die 
Praise the most high, we're all gonna die 
If my wings should fail me lord, meet me with another pair
