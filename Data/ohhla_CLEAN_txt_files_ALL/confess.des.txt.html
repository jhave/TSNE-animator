Thou shall confess

[Missy]
Uh, uh, oh

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, no, ooh
ooh, ooh, no

[Missy]
Verse one

[Beyoncé]
The day you pissed me off
I told Mike to pick me up
I told him you was buggin' and I don't like to fuss
He said he would look out for me
If I needed a friend
He took me to his house and then he invited me in

Then we sat on the couch, he put his arms around my waist
Knowin' I need lovin' and then he grabbed my face
He kissed me like a guy could never kiss a girl before
So you know what happened baby
I need to say no more

1 - 	I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did
	I might as well come clean
	What you feel about that baby
	I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did
	I might as well come clean
	What you feel about that baby

2 - 	I'm just guessing that you're through with me
	Cause I just came clean
	What you feel about that baby
	I'm just guessing, are you through with me
	Cause I just came clean
	What you feel about that

[Missy]
Verse two

[Beyoncé]
Remember the time you wondered where your money went
I called my friends and bought some clothes
And took them on a trip
I met a dude that had a Jeep
And we talked all the time
He asked me about my man
And you know that I had to lie

He thought I had no man and I was chillin' by myself
Don't get mad cause I feel sad
That's why I must confess
Too many times I wanted to let you know my dirt
But everytime you said you loved me
I knew it would hurt

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

3 - 	I was mad, what was I to do?
	Never had it in mind to play on you
	But look at all the hurt you put me through
        I can't tell a lie so I'm tellin' the truth

 	I was mad, what was I to do?
	Never had it in mind to play on you
	But look at all the hurt you put me through
        You know, you know

Repeat 3
Repeat 1
Repeat 2

[Missy]
Confess
Come clean, boo
Yo, what you feel about that
What you feel about, uh
What you feel about that
Heh heh, confessing baby
Misdemeanor, Destiny, uh uh

Repeat 2</pre>
