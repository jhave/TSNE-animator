[Killah Priest]
From her womb I went zoom
Through a misty gloom pass the moon
Through a gape in deep space
Finally I had room
To create, I shift shape
A single thought brought me through warps
I transport to a spiritual land but not loss
A strange cause
I circled around, driven by force
I lit up the night with light
Become one with the light source
Just like a hawk, with black wings
Black as the night, flapping
I go up, the stardust left in my trails
From a strong thrust
I felt the rush blowing through a gust
1200 spirits flying out of me
I see an odyssey
There was Enoch, Elijah, Emmanuel
The man with nails
Through his hands and feet
Blessed the meek
I felt asleep in the deep, couldn't speak
When I awoke, still a ghost
Still afloat, Assyrian folks I see starring at me
24 elders called the "Lord helpers"
Behind them were many more in white they all held doves
6 on the left, 6 on the right
Now let the 12 judge
Books were opened, I looked at the golden throne
For them that was chosen
I looked again, catacombs
I see scattered bones before this chapter close
Let me break it down for ya
Enoch represented that the black man is in us
Elijah meant the sun fire
That's why he was taken higher
Emmanuel showed us the black man's hell
This white man's jail is their heaven
Wait on the seventh
I'ma show you where we're heading

(Jeni Fujita)
I'ma show you where we're heading
And I'ma show you where we're heading

Enoch, Elijah, Emmanuel

Hero Emmanuel
Hero Emmanuel
Bring his captives home
Bring his captives home
Bring back the remnant of Israel
Bring back the remnant of Israel

[Killah Priest]
I heard the missile go "Ka-boom"
Saw the clouds like a mushroom
The whole planet in such doom
The Egyptian's opened up King Tut's tomb
Kawasaki went "Vroom"
My spirit outta body
Nail Cheselden Anunnaki, Godly
Eloi, Eloi, ah, Eli, Eli, rise
Seven plain, the unexplained
I don't change
Their continents were like lightning
The pyramids were like the Mayans
Beyond the Orion
Star followed by the Three Wise Men
Flying in the spiritual Zion
The Constellation showed the lion
The dawn to the horizon - their eyes on
And the angel has said "come with us
You need rest, where there's no height, no depth
There's no weeping, nor-no death
Nor-no bone, nor-no flesh
No blood, nor-no sweat
Can't enter all except thy Holiness"

(Jeni Fujita)
There's no weeping, nor-no death
Nor-no bone, nor-no flesh
No blood, nor-no sweat
Hero Emmanuel
Hero Emmanuel
Bring his captives home
Bring his captives home
Bring back the remnant of Israel
Bring back the remnant of Israel

From now on these men will revolve
around you like the planets around the sun.</pre>
