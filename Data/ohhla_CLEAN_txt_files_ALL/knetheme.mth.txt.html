[Method Man]
Ah-ahhowwwwwwwwww!

We are... here...
to lay this boy... to rest...
And so shall you... 
be put, to death...

[Method Man]
Beware of the six-six-six
So morbid and twisted I'm sick, sick, sick
Mad and sadistic, dark like sun when it eclipses
Grab your crucifixes and RUN... 
from the hellfire fiend, The Big Red Machine
Heads get chopped in the guillotine, burnt in kerosene
Now you don't believe in the unseen
By any means necessary back to the cemetary
IT'S KANE!

Chorus: Method Man

Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable
Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable (It's KANE!)
Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable
Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable

[Method Man]
I rise from the tomb
A quarter pass midnight, full moon
The theme music kicks in, you'rre doomed
Soon comes the bell, it's me against you in a cage match cell
You get a chokeslam from hell
LOOK OUT!  Great balls of fire, no doubt
My flame can't be doused, this is what pain's about
Lock all the doors and the windows in your house
Night of the Grim Reaper, tales from the Crypt Keeper
IT'S KANE!

Chorus

[Method Man]
Feel the tombstone piledriver
You hit the floor, thankin God you're alive-ah
Hail Mary take no prisoners and no survivors
Found scary like a convoy of drunk drivers, ahhhhhhhowww
Tragic, that old black magic
A-tisket-a-tasket, a coffin or a casket
Grateful Dead, nightmares that make you wet the bed
Visions of bloodshed dancing through your head
IT'S KANE!

Chorus 1/2

{*Method Man grunts and growls*}

IT'S KANE! (2X)

Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable
Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable

{*Meth babbles on until fade*}</pre>
