[Verse 1]
I woke up early in the mornin', hoes blowin up my phone
Ain't no use small talkin' when they know I'm tryna bone, fuck 'em
I'll holla later man, right now my mind else where
My mom's health care get her out this hell here a lot of niggas fail
Frail niggas won't prevail here
We seen it all man niggas can't even spell scared
A fresh prince but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air
Fuck if you would sell, I'm worried bout my welfare
So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid
Soon as my dough straight
I throw the wifey in some Dolce and put some chains on my niggas like own slaves
I get up, look out the window hope the sun shining
Down on my niggas outhere front linin'
I hit the streets and see them boys out here locking up some older head
So god damn homey hold ya head (and hold ya head)

[Refrain]
I get up
I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma ya son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl I'm a make to the end though, up to the top if climb my way
And tell em' I'm a rise I'm on my
Headed for the sky I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
Paint a picture to show the deaf what it's like to listen
And speak the words and tell a blind man what he missin'
For all my niggas doin' time man up in prison
Thought you had to resort to crime man fuck the system
We raisin' babies up in Hades where there ain't' no hope
Ain't no fathers don't take no scholarship to slang no dope
Politicians hollerin' bout problems but I ain't gon' vote
He talk bout change, still we floatin' in the same ol' boat
So tell me how I'm suppose to feel when the President spoke
When he ain't neva had to struggle ain't neva been broke
Ain't even roll through the ghetto ain't neva been close
Trustin' this government like trustin' the devil in oath
For rebel with quotes I get up
Life style of the young, black, and reckless
A generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions
Like tell me why I ain't got shit
I let this liquor fill my liver with them toxics
As I zip

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, to all my niggas paper chasin'
I pray for your patience
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cakin'
Takin' this shit one step at a time
That real shit is stuck in my mind
But to that bullshit I'm deaf and I'm blind
Destined to shine I'm a find a way
Cause hey
Dammit them jobs outthere ain't tryna pay
I pray
Granted 9 to 5 is how you survive
I ain't tryna survive, I'm tryna throw my momma in rides
I'm a provide for my seed I'm the soil
I teach 'em bout loyalty
I teach 'em that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
I show 'em all the things that my pops was neva showin' me
Treat 'em like a growin' tree with this poetry
I get up
And show the sons how to lead not to follow
The present is our gift but our seeds got tommorow
So please niggas raise your kids
And help em' overcome that bull shit they daze us with
I blaze the shit
