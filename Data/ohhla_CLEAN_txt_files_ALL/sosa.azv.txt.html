Minolta devil expousure wide lens view 
Check for dentals and niggaz next to push tha Benz through 
You know the glow iced out rings long dough
Spandex Mossino hoe bitches lettin they ass show  
I play the game took plenty paper still remain the same 
Asian name beval length chain lettin my piece hang
Domestic no more crime play but still connected 
It's ethics calculated steps through geometrics 
Ways spinnin double Shades of base linin 97' expidition
Disflavored all tha trimmins
Travel light push tha LS on casual nights 
Have you ever puffed tha tallas weed pipe
That shit will have you right 
I roll dice tryin to deforce from this cold life
Used to sell coke on tha strip now I hold mic
and plan soon to pack an vacate so were in Cancun
Escape to a cozy estate filled wit mad rooms 
?? too many foul niggaz time to turn it up 
Push it by the buck and shift gears burn the clutch
Cause it's like this for these chips I strike swift preciseness
Precious jewels a life thats priceless 
I payed my dues and through it all I never trade my shoes
Cash rules new crews who made the news 
We all for paper I guess greed is just a second nature 
Indeed shots an ?hebock? on weed to escalate ya 
Some mostly touch along the line crossed up
I took tha short cut puffin on blunts bustin off nuts
The night type love dime bitches and night life 
Casino dice sexy strip Dancers and white ice
I seen the movie most of you niggaz couldn't move me
Truly it's like a 6-shot ruger against an ozzie 
So bust ya run or cock back bust your gun but I fake none 
I remain like the sun bless tha stong livin
Intellect an long vision connects in prison 
and real niggaz wit recognition 
so respect the mission volume one 
Second addition the next dimension
