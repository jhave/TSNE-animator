Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Purp, purp, purp, purp
Yeah you know I got that purp
OG kush and girl scout cookies
Cherry pie, no not dessert
What up Wale

Smoking on the finest, got a crib look like a palace
And I'm still prince of the city, so approach me as your highness
Tattoos on my body, in my joint I got exotic
And don't question all the niggas I got posted up behind me, that's that
Gang, gang, gang, gang, yea you know I rep that gang
Diamonds in my watch and I got Cuban Linx up in my chain
Uh, Ok I'm balling like a hooping game
Should go on you lames but I got songs to do with Snoop today
Money getting stupid, I'm still rolling weed on my ipad
And these niggas mad that I'm doing good and they fucked up so that's my bad
I love champagne so 30 thousand that's my tag
Out in Vegas nigga roll some weed when you play this

[Bridge]
I got weight, weight, weight, weight
Weight, weight, weight, weight, weight

[Chorus]
Purp, purp, purp, purp
Yeah you know I got that purp
OG kush and girl scout cookies
Cherry pie, no not dessert
What up Wale</pre>
