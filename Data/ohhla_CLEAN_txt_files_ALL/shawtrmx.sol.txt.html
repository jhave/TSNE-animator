[Intro: Plies]
Ay, what's happenin homey?
This {?} Plies, man (shaw-tay)
Ay Pain, I want you tell 'em bout your shawty homie
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeaaaaaah)
and I'ma tell em bout mine, dawg

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Now, even though I'm not yo man, you not my girl
I'ma call you my - shaaaaaaw-ty...
Cause I cain't stand to see you treated bad, I beat his ass
for my  - shaaaaaaaw-ty...
And we ain't did nothin that we ain't sup'POSED to do
Cause you my  - shaaaaaaw-ty... (oh-oh)
Baby girl you know I be home, keep me on the ringtoooone
Shaaaaaaw-ty - sang it to me girl!

[Solomon Childs]
You make me feel so wild, you make me feel so strong
Girl, your sex appeal is real
Caress your body, so you can feel how real is real
Let's coast together, hot air balloon together
Lost deep in each other, love the fact
You never get jealous, never flirt with them other fellas
We don't got to limit the love
Outdoor kisses and hugs, haze by the dubs
Hot sex on the persian rug, practicing safe sex
So I never forget the gloves
He don't deserve you, you worth more than diamonds
Build better than Bentleys, baby baby, I ride with you
'07 Summer Love, the sound
He'd rather argue, I'd rather make you smile
When you come around I'm looking to hold you down

[Chorus]


[Interlude: T-Pain w/ Solomon Childs ad-libs]
Oh-oh (whooooooooa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (whooooooooa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (WH-OA-wh-oa, wh-oa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (whooooooooa)
Shawwwwww-DEEEE-EEEE, yeah...
Oh-oh (whooooooooa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (whooooooooa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (WH-OA-wh-oa, wh-oa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (whooooooooa)
(Shaaaaaaw-ty, yeah)
SHAW-DEE, whoa, w-w-wh-oa, OH!

[Plies]
I love to show her off, cause all the dope boys want her
Know why dey wanna beat badly, look at all dat ass on her!
Look how dat pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her
Love when she act like she bowlegged and bend the co'ner
She proud to be fuckin me, cause I'm stuntin on 'em!
It feel good to be fuckin a real nigga, do'nuh?
Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her
That's why I don't mind breakin 'er off, cause she ain't with the drama
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil' mama
You know she gotta be somethin, cause I done beat her hunda
Babe snatchin, not now, I'm tellin ya, I promise!
I exposed her to real and now she hate lame
'member she used to run from me, now she like pain
She call me sometimes just to ask is it her thang
Ever since I ran up in shawty, she ain't been the same

[Chorus]

[Interlude: T-Pain w/ Solomon Childs ad-libs]

Shawwwwww-DEEEE-EE-EE, yeah...

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (whooooooooa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (WH-OA-wh-oa, wh-oa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (whooooooooa)
