Where you from nigga?

[Layzie Bone]
Straight from the muthafuckin' land ah the heartless
Five true thugs from the double glock
Ready ta pop to the dome, eternally it's on
Yeah,

Verse 1: Layzie Bone

Staright Mo Thug nigga return from the Claire
Test this hustla betta not dare
We talkin' about distributing llelo
Little Layzie beat it
Daily collectin' me bank roll
Rollin' wid Trues, nothing to lose
Never the less ain't about that talking
Screamin' out murda coming ta serve ya
Nigga we told ya Bone be stalking, (we walking)
Number one assassin
Pick up the pump and it causing the 12-guage eruption
Let loose wid ah buckshot blastin'
Bone up outta the cut and we buckin'
Eternally here to stay in the khaki suits and the high tec boots
Oops I'm comin' wid troops, fools
Be ready ta shoot collectin' my loot
Blazin' and burnin' my grain
This year the same I crept and I came
Niggas that fell off that thought they could hang
Givin' up slang tryna' fuck wid ah chain gang BANG!
Str8 land ah the heartless
Where the thugs be thinkin' ah execution
Str8 prosecution little Lay go buck and start the fusion

Hook:

Keepin' em on the run widda me shotgun
I swang wid ah clip tight clan
Keepin' em on the run widda me shotgun
Swang wid ah clip tight clan
Keepin' em on the run widda me shotgun
I swang wid ah clip tight clan
Keepin' em on the run widda me shotgun
Swang wid ah clip tight clan

Verse 2: Bizzy &amp; Krayzie Bone

Come and follow me hollow point snub slug
Pullin' me body underground
Put 'em in the grave they lay away down
Claire Claire stay down
I'm one ah the thuggest muthaFUCKAS in yo city
Under me strap packed
Ride, ready me pap pap in broad daylight
You wid me roll well roll till the Bone drop hit that hydro
That's the way that we deal
That's the way that we steal
Well I really keep that high on, my mind ride,
Ride to the darkside feel the darkness
East ninety nine, mine the thugs I luvs 'em heartless
Yeah follow me now ride ride follow me commit some
You can run but won't escape the lie
So many tried but died

Verse 3: Krayzie Bone

Niggas be runnin' and duckin' them bullets
Ain't tryna' get scared or we all ah get sprayed
Gotta get away when the po-pos chase me
So me, runnin' wid me guage
Bang bang put 'em in ah coffin
Buck buck droppin' them bodies
(Come again) dumpin' them bodies
(Runnin' then) we finna posse
Thug what check out the glock glock
We to poetic for swang
Niggas claim they came and remain
Smoke bud all day and maintain
They come they gun they run
&gt;From the po-po jump the fence
Hit 95th and now
Nigga let's roll some shit
Let's smoke out quick befo' anyone ah them
That's them the po-po back up on me
Nigga me fucked up now
Little time they screamin' on 6-5
That's whenna me jumped up, I'm out now
Little nigga playin' wid them police in the Claire
Get 'em up wid, beware I take
Nigga need some weed

Really don't drink but it's for me Trues
Four crazy niggas wid nuthin' to looooose.

Verse 4: Wish Bone

I'm from the C-Town we beat 'em
Thug niggas done straight came up,

Buckshots all in that chest he's fucked up,
Killas from the nigga that's realer

Bendin' that dunn
Pop when they run dunn
Bodies gon' fall my Cleveland niggas what's up
Ya down for that thang gotta gang bang bang if you have to,
Beat ah nigga down in any town,
But don't let me catch ya
Mentality straight from the C-Town
Where everyday niggas get beat down
Betta think before you run up
I gun up but I think keep peep this game now
To the niggas that's just gone by that fuckin' wid Bone
Swang widda clip tight clan
It's all eternally flossed out
Nigga that's Bone.......
