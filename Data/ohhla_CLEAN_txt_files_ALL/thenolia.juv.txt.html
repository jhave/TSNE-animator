Say Bubba
I'm glad you, gave me the green light
so I can write some shit, for my hood
And talk about the shit I see
Y'knahmsayin? I've been waitin for this chance to do this
and express my motherfuckin self, and still make fun at the shit
Y'all ready to do this?

You might get flipped in the Nolia
You might get water whipped in the Nolia
And niggaz is a trip in the Nolia
They be on some shit in the Nolia
Them hoes be twerkin in the Nolia
Police be lurkin in the Nolia
My pockets be hurtin in the Nolia
You gotta be workin in the Nolia
I hit my first bitch in the Nolia
I hit my first lick in the Nolia
I opened up shop in the Nolia
I damn near got popped in the Nolia
I be up in the cuts in the Nolia
Hemmin them niggaz up in the Nolia
Oh yeah we stick together in the Nolia
Down for whatever in the Nolia

[Chorus]
Magnolia my home, and it's gon' always be
You get a trespassin charge when you fuckin with me
Magnolia my home, and it's gon' always be
You get a trespassin charge when you fuckin with me

[Juvenile]
Yeah I was strugglin in the Nolia
Came up on nothin in the Nolia
Nigga was hustlin in the Nolia
Junkies was rushin in the Nolia
I done had fights in the Nolia
Damn near lost my life in the Nolia
We play the porch in the Nolia
We hang out in the courts in the Nolia
We be on the flight in the Nolia
We be up all night in the Nolia
I used to live in the Nolia
Ever since a kid in the Nolia
Nigga gettin busted in the Nolia
Some niggaz can't be trusted in the Nolia
A nigga got jacked in the Nolia
Got stabbed in the back of the Nolia

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
Nigga shoot dice in the Nolia
We fuckin nigga wifes in the Nolia
We always act our ass in the Nolia
We always have a splash in the Nolia
Oh yeah we havin wars in the Nolia
Shootin at niggaz cars in the Nolia
We all go to ki's in the Nolia
We all wear soldierees in the Nolia
Dem hoes thick fine in the Nolia
We throw second lines in the Nolia
We got no cheap in the Nolia
Come and holla at my peeps in the Nolia
The shit don't ever stop in the Nolia
It's always pepper hot in the Nolia
We got a lot of thugs in the Nolia
But we got a lot of love in the Nolia

[Chorus] - repeat 1.5X

[Juvenile]
