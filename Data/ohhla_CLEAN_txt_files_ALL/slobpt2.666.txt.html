(Gangsta Boo)
Slob on my cat 
Cause you know it's fat
Check in with me 
And do that

(Juicy J)
Wait a second freak 
I know you from the streets 
My nigga Hurry T
Has seen you through his mean
They call you little red
The one who slobs on head
And drinks a niggas nut
Until you well and fed
To see what she's about
I creaped to her house
To catch her in her blouse
And see how big her mouth
She pulled me to her room
To get the fuckin soon
I didn't have a rubber
I fucked with two balloons
Lay on the bed 
That's all she said
Her pussy has one problem
Twisted tight in streads
The fucken sounds were tunes
I fucked her with a broom
She rode it like a horse 
The blood came rushing soon
When I seen that 
I didn't want the cat
So I found out 
And never came back

(Chorus)
Sucks on dick 
Does it real good
Sucks sucks on dick 
Does it real good
Sucks on dick 
Does it real good
Sucks sucks on dick 
Does it real good

(Juicy J)
My nigga D Magic
Had said he finally got it
The true and false blow
He said he had to have it
Know a little freak 
In big ham
Licks up nuts
Like lickin stamps
She'll grant your wishes
Blow you freaky kisses
House full of G's
Freak horse bitches
Had the little freak
In my niggas jeep
Try to spit some game
To get her suck some meat
Lay on the cover
My natural hair she loved it
Stop bitch stop bitch 
Please don't touch it
Took her trough some hoods
And let her hoe around
7 street 9 street
And street of walks and brown
Now she's in click
A pro on suckin dick
Until the rugged out
The bitch was smokin bricks
Straight trough the blow pipes
That's all she thought
Runnin from the rehab 
Never got caught</pre>
