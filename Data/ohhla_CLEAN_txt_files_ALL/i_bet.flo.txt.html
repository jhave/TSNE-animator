I bet that you can wine slow take it down low...
(shawty what you waitin' on)
I bet that you can wine fast you got all that ass on you...
(now what you think I'm 'bout to do)

[Flo Rida]
Hey, money on deck for the dying
Make it pop for me I bet you can wine
Look back at it coz shawty you're to fine
Lil' mama got a fatty I'm lovin ya waste line
Just like that you'll get them dollaz if ya wine
Twurk that nasty drop it a few times
Spot light flash me baby you're my kind
A lil' bit of classy workin' that's fine
I like it fast I don't mind if it's slow
I got plenty of cash if you take it down low
Call it music ma just what are you waitin' for
What it do get it fast I'm the man with the doe
Shorty gon' get it like your ready for the pole
There's no limit thanksgivin' I'm givin' you bankrolls
Since your back stage in it I see it it's all swoll
Give it just one minute I betcha you get yours

[T-Pain]
You can get up off that wall shawty come and make it pop for me...

Hey you wanna bet girl
I see you been blessed by your set girl
All that below your waist and your dress girl
I wanna know what it look like wet girl
If your strippin' while I'm tippin'
Henney sippin' call it big pimpin'
Keep it flippin' I ain't trippin'
Girl dem jeans rippin' cause your thick and
Ring the alarm cause lil' mama your on
Duck in the truck so I take you back home
I can't even front I'm a say you da bomb
Look how you suck with that ring in ya tounge
I just wanna show 'em watcha waitin' on
I can see ya thong I won't leave ya 'lone
I won't lead ya wrong keep ya sexy grown
You already gone you already on
Sippin' on Patron anybody home
This ya favorite song c'mon
