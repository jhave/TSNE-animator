(And now for our feature presentation)

[Intro - Various reporters asking questions]
We're live in New York City awaiting Loso
Oh there he is, there he is (Loso, Loso, excuse me)
Loso, right over here (hey, over here)
Loso, do you have any comments? (do you have a word for the Associated Press?)
Excuse me Loso, can I have one comment? (Loso right here, three questions, two questions)
One minute Loso (what is the verdict?) (hello?) (give me a second of your time)
(Anything you want to tell you fans?)
Excuse me, can we have one comment?
Loso, Loso, right over here (what about those papers?) (how did we do last night?)
(Watch your step)
Loso, can I please have one question? (excuse me, Loso, Loso) (over here Loso)
Loso, Loso (I got ya)
What do you have to say about the way you have been treated throughout your career?
(Just one question, one question)

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
I said, fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all
Y'all done turned a good guy into a Chuckie doll
I would a been your friend 'til the end bitch
And guess it ain't no friends in this shit business
Just a bunch of assholes in a shit business
But they won't flush me down the toilet bowl without my tissue
These bitches talk shit out the same mouth that kiss you
These niggaz kiss ass with the same mouth that diss you
Eww, you niggaz disgust me
And they ain't talkin 'bout shit unless they discuss me
Let's talk about how I'm killin everything I touches
Or how I walked in this game with no crutches
No Diddy, No Dupri, No Dr. Dre
No Cash Money from Baby and no Rocs from Jay
And I'm still here (still here), we still here (still here)
What does this break dude? It's still here
And dude talk, concernin New York
When I was runnin the city, you was learnin to walk
So I watched you niggaz take they first steps and I was happy for ya
Daddy was clappin for ya
But wasn't for me it probably wouldn't of happened for ya
So I rest my case, I'm a rappin lawyer
That's unless you wanna talk bad bitches
Section full of Bridezillas, that's mad bitches
No words, I describe 'em with letters best
They pretty as can 'B'/be, curvy as the letter 'S' (S)
They keep it 'G' (G), they sweet as 'T'/tea (T)
Look good in the passenger seat of 'V' (V)
They ride double 'R' (R), smell like double 'C' (C)
The bags are 'LV', 'D' or double 'G' (G)
Fly as hell (hell), shades, wired cell (hell)
On 'E', sippin 'PJ', high as hell
And please don't even talk about swag (nah)
I'm cool and collective, a fool with perspective
I'm far from being typical, my respect is reciprocal
I already came up, you still on the zipper pull
And I would say my style is 5th Ave. meets Brooklyn
I keep the hood watchin, I got the streets lookin
They watch what I do, so they know what to do
Little money never told big money what to do (nice)
Money talks, if you speak Guap-anese
A language better known if you gettin cheddar homes
If not get a loan, use that like Rosetta Stone
And that way you can holla 'bout a dollar
I hear 'em cryin broke, they holla like a toddler
Come holla at yo guala, don't holla at Savalas
You'll end up down under tryin to holla at koalas
I keep that nine on me, ala Iguodala (yeah)
We can get it jumpin like the 'drolics on Impala
I feel like Nino lettin them Rottweilers off the collar
Somebody tell me something, What the fuck happened? (huh?)
Somebody talk to me, motherfuck rappin (huh?)
They infiltrated the game but who let in the Pookies? (who?)
Kingpins is snitchin that shit is not Lukey (that's not cool)
So fuck new friends, Lefty stay solo
'Cause who gon' watch your back after you kill Manolo?
Isn't it ironic Santana's own fella stabbed him? (damn)
The "King of New York" died while they yellow cabbed him
No "Carlito's Way", when I spot a hater drop him like a hot potato
You won't hear he got me later
Yeah I keep it gangsta but I'm a do it my way (my way)
The new day of the week is called "Myday" (Myday)
So it's my say (my say), pass my K (my K)
I'm through talkin (*mimicking drum roll*)</pre>
