[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Hello world my name is not important
Today it's about (Tyga) yes sir
Lay you {lay you} lay you {lay you} down
Yeah, let's go
I'ma sit back and smoke
I might grab my guitar

[Chorus]
I got these bullets in the cham-ber
Don't make me, let off a round
If my life's in dan-ger
I'm gonna lay you down lay you down
Your life's in my cham-ber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in dan-ger
I'm gonna lay you down lay you down

[Tyga]
Uhh I ain't a killer but don't push me
Only soft shit I'm into {nigga} is {pussy}
Hard-head, from a city where really you blue or all red
Like, when it pop off {*boom boom*} better play dead
Ha~! Same day, catch me on some different shit
Front yard posted on some prison shit
Uh, even as a kid fight until you win
Life is kill or be killed, yeah

[Chorus] + {Lil Wayne ad libs}

{So like I said}
{Or better yet like he said}
{...}
{Get 'em boy}

[Tyga]
Uhh, I like to floss so momma told me be cautious (just be careful)
She know the cost, she tell me death ain't a option (that's not a option)
Too many lives lost, shootout on the boulevard
Gun drawn, pick a card, lucky me I wasn't home
Damn - I hope it, wasn't one of my homies dawg
His family called - I ain't even hear my phone
Now I'm lookin for revenge, swervin on this road
If I should die and never wake, pray the Lord take my soul
But you already know

[Chorus] + {Lil Wayne ad libs}

{So like I said}
{Or better yet like he said}
{...}
{Yeah! Got 'em baby, love you baby!}

[Lil Wayne]
A-hem, reportin live from the barrel (get 'em)
Two tear drops under that eye on the sparrow (uhhh)
I'm from a small place they call Uptown
where we {lay you} where we {lay you} ha ha ha! {down}
Like concrete in the driveway, shoot sideways
like O-Dog on +Menace+ leave yo' brains in yo' tennis
I'm the renaissance man, so put me in the book
and I got my pistol on the hook - sing it (ha ha)

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
When I say fuck y'all
I really mean mammy motherfuck all y'all
Tyga Tyga {lay you} Young Money {lay you} I thought you knew {down}
{Lay you, lay you, down}</pre>
