Killa Arm 9-8
this L.P.'s a banga
yeah

[Chorus]
Yo, Killarmy in ya Galaxy
in ya continent
in ya state
in ya city
take'em to war throw ya grenade
this shit is gritty
rollin' tanks, carry shanks
while ya'll niggaz shoot blanks
livin' gun powder roll black down
dealin' wit ranks
Yo, Killarmy in ya Galaxy
in ya continent
in ya state
in ya city
take'em to war throw ya grenade
this shit is gritty

[Verse 1]
Yo, What's the sign's on ya crab ass
niggaz out here in this rap shit
turning this shit into some fuckin' after shit
step into my chamber I hang ya
like a stranger out tah dry with the mic cord
rapped around your neck like 2 times
design to leave you breathless
to the pointt where you past out
flat lined simple mined ass cats
get ya fingers snap back outta place (what)
and dislocated reaching for that mic device kid I'm Nice

[Verse 2]
Yo, We never timid break the street limit
state laws and glass jars and fake malls, 
burst pause we take jobs wiseguys who want a prize guy
we snatch mics bitch right turn out the light
mathamatics strikes a site make me pull my fist tight
we wild every night bump shoulders clubs over
night crips start to fight wnet to Santalaw 
pulled out the dialog bashed his dome with the smearin' off
now he scramin' off razor sharp face off 
killarmy cut, pushin' through like what
always housted up double edge leave you with a buck
fifty three nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Terrorist arch nemesis this is my testament
eternal life is through the mind
the 1st element
the 1st to settle it
the 1st to pull the medal
the 1st to defeat the devil
the 1st to take it to that level
feel the valume ajust the levels
enjoy the treble, the 1st and last rebel
crush a stone into a pebble
they be trackin' holy water baptise
my rhyme is sort of ice mentora 
mental explorer my guardly aura
star bright light up your life like night light
heard you wanna fight return ya ass 
twice mental and physycal

[Verse 4]
Yo, the last star fighter Princelton soldier
northern exposer built with Noah
easy adtic aposer mic feel the black thrower
to retrieve renagade anroid seek and destroy
any man ??? paranoid ??? time zone at 1751
we bury a 100 course of rome prince of dogs
is cloned lyrical arthritus contain this to the bone
my rhyme battle star galactica  terrorist star detector
scarfaces are mass discourage weak lyricist are perish
I ??? courage physical fight ??? package
razor blazes so sharp to slice ya eyelashes
rap is gossip while I speak gospel like teachers crisis
with the apstols the mind and matter
people to the science smother Mc with a pillow
livin' dying science

[Chorus 1.5X]</pre>
