(Silkk)
For real, I know we from different sides and all
and I ain't even gon lie, I'm a thug
but i got a guestion for you
could you see yourself fallin for somebody like me
what's up?

[Chorus]
(Mya)
So what you wanna do
a girl like me, a guy like you
what we could do
it's whatever baby anything that we want to
will i fall for a thug like you

[Verse 1]
(Silkk)
Could you see yourself fallin for somebody like me and um
in fact if you could
i got money now
can you see yourself if you had to move back up in the hood
now during sex lay there i'ma have to ask if it's good
this rap stuff stressful let's go see if we can relax in the woods
when i first met you at the bus stop lookin all shy-like
tellin your friend how much that you hated my type
but I'm ready to change, 
I'm willin to put the game on it, put the range on it
put powerful things on it
sooner or later probably have tattos with my name on it
now look i like to live fast, addicted to cash, the 45 on the dash
and you know me, if you know me, o.g. i'm down to act bad
i need a more than a friend but not quite a relationship
a girl when i come off tour i can't wait to get with
not the stupid chick the one i probably could vacation with
you gotta go somewhere you know what boo go ahead
take the six
now you gotta make a choice either wrong or right
you tried before maybe you just need a thug in your life
what's up

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Mya)
You keep, keep on askin me
if I, say if I wanna be with you
the tough part is to think i could
fall for some body like you

[Verse 2]
(Silkk)
You advanced, took a couple chances and shit
chances with bricks, couple chances now you sittin in 
mansions and shit
you done gambled with this thug and won
you know what i'm sayin it's thug life
cock the glock, pop the glock, drop the top and run
I can't change I'm to deep in it so let me know if you wit me
can't make no promises but if we make it thru boo 
then sky's the limit
we on the west on the beach, we takin trips to the east
takin shoppin sprees 'til they damn near hurt our feet
got you a five when you like smashed the four
didn't even wreck it you just laid there and scratched the door
step out the house it's more like a fashion show
anything and everything you want you got that you ain't even gotta
ask no more...imagine that

(Mya)
It never really mattered too much to me
that you were just too damn ghetto for me
all my girls think i'm not quite ready for you
so now i try to sneak away to be with you

[Chorus]

[Bridge 2] 
(Silkk)		Every woman need a down man
(Mya)		Every man need a down chick
(Silkk)		Watch your so-called friends
(Mya)		Watch them niggas you hang around with
(Silkk)		I need somebody I can be serious with
(Mya)		I need somebody I can clown with
(Silkk) 	It's thug love and I think I found it

[Chorus]

(Mya)
Will I fall
for this thug
Will I fall for a thug like you</pre>
