[Verse 1: Guru]
Aiiyo, I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one is pointed at your weak ass heart
If I pull the trigger all these fully loaded rhymes
You wish you would have pulled the glock nine
I stop crime, drop dimes on fake gangsters and bitin ass niggaz
Yeah them studio pranksters, lookin at the situation plainly
Will you remain G or will you be looked upon strangely
I reign as the articulator with the data
Revolvin on task man yeah I'm doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle, tricky metaphors
I dig deep and torch both the true gore
Are you sure that your image ain't fantasy
What's all this bullshit you namin me
I ain't Superman but I stand here with proof
That you will meet your moment of truth

[DJ Premier cuts and scratches]
"I'm not Superman, I don't claim to be
	but you be done by the seven if you fuck with me"

[Verse 2: Guru]
Thug you caught out there with no clout here
The atmosphere grows cold, the alcohol made you boom
Lets take the way you live with confidence you lackin defence
So now your knees are bend, you prayin for forgiveness
You was kinda up in this materialistic, plastic masquerade
Your thoughts will twist it, now your ass is played
Way to the waters of a motion
While I walk above loungin with my ghetto love
You thought your games was smooth as lotion
But the truth comes to light and push comes to shove
Fans are lookin at you, wantin to smack you
And stick up kids wantin to stick you and attack you
The way you act dude, makes me cute I must refute
All comments from you, coops, my sly loops and singing hooks
With all the flavor, walk around with your suitable rudeboy behavior
Come on, what you think this is? Yo this ain't T.V. or the movies
And fuck all the showbiz put up the he(?) aligned divine save you
You got no hand skillz there's no security to save ya
No pager no celly no drop top Benzy
I came to bring your fake hip hop to an ending
I ain't Superman but I stand here with proof
That you will meet your moment of truth
