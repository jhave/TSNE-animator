The sun rises and sets on time every day of the year
But sporadically, the circles appear
Bafflin' all through the history of no man
Since fuckin' with the mystery of Stonehenge
Aliens, cults, witches with lawnmowers
Mind blowers, nobody knows what for sure
Bloody nose when I walk in the vicinity
But I can read em, and I believe that I need em
I'm runnin through a wheat field chasing a ghost
They love cicles, use em for portals and time holes
And dance backwards and chant with the crow people
At the crop circle, I come to know people
Under moon rays, lightin' up my new ways
The new lays, they mow em down in 2 days
A hundred years from now we'll pay for that mishap
With another motherfuckin' hurricane bitch slap

The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something
The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something
Something solely meant just for me
Circle something, circle something
The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something

[Violent J]
This ball of mud that we live on is alive
You try to wipe its mouth, it's gonna wipe us out
I lay in the field alone in the middle of the night
I try to get my life right and pray for bright light
Set flames to the wheat rows during an eclipse
And the spirits will come out and dance, catch you a glimpse
There like artist connect me the stars in rare fashion
Intricately placed with secrets of white magic
Im runnin' through the moonlit fields
Following a little orb light hoping it might reveal
Any secret, it's dancing and I can't catch up
And I almost ran headfirst into a truck
No compass will work, and I'm lookin' for answers
While the sands of my hour glass fall up backwards
Have I lost you? cause I've lost me too
But if your hiding in the crops I will come find you

[Hook]
The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something
The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something
Something solely meant just for me
Circle something, circle something
The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something

[Violent J]
Forty thousand years ago, the stoning of a young man
His story written in the crops near spoken
In England, The face of a dead woman
Shown, etched out a wheatfield uniquely woven

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Hierogliphics, mathmatical genius
Predicting the orbital patterns of Venus
In the grass behind your grandpa's wood barn
Complex designs dropped seconds before dawn

[Violent J]
Dead birds scattered throughout the patterns of earth
No explanations left by the shadows of dark
Batteries drained of there power in seconds
I'm laying in the crop circles countin' my blessings

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
And my no headaches and nausea will creep in
And your nose will bleed when your sleepin'

[Violent J]
Don't go near there don't dare beware
Unless your like us and don't care

The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something
The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something
Something solely meant just for me
Circle something, circle something
The crop circles are talking to me
Circle something, circle something
