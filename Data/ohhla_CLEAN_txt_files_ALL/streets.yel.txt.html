[Intro: DJ Yella]
Gangster!

[Verse 1: Gangsta Dre'sta]
A life time, a bad luck
It's sad but the nigga stayed strong
Pray everyday that my life goes on
Cause the streets ain't givin' the black man shit
So my attitude is; you can suck the fat man's dick
Tricks in my face, for my snaps cause I'm rappin'
I puts them in their place 
when I pulls up my strap and slap them
Backwards with the theory of my anger
Nigga's so crazy on the daily talkin' strangers
Wanna hit the stick, I'm scared of the Bombay
Andre, never was a Dope Fiend anyway
I'd rather lay back in the cut 
Be corrupt, and fuck shit up 
Because I'm stuck in the streets

[Chorus: Michel'le]
It's seems the streets, they just won't let me go
Just won't let me go
Sometimes I wish, I find some where to go
Gotta find some where to go
It's seems the streets, they just won't let me go
Let me go
Sometimes I wish, I find some where to go

[Verse 2: Gangsta Dre'sta]
Damn, it's a shame, I blame myself for my bad luck
A young buck nigga growin' up, gave a mad fuck
I'm rollin' through at night shit in papers
Give hoes the vapors, and live in skyscrapers
But I guess I tried to move too fast
So the lord had to stop my black ass with a blast (*Gun Shot*)
One shot to my back, makin' small tracks
Think of my life where am I tryin' not to fall flat
As I swell, people yell, Damn he hit Dre
My nigga Dale rushed me to MLK
Blankin' out, but still thinkin' about survival
When a nigga didn't even have my post on the Rival
I tell my mamma, yeah, I love you
Born to hug you not dug you 
Being able to death from the cradle

[Chorus: Michel'le w/ minor Variations]
It's seems the streets, they just won't let me go
I gotta go
Sometimes I wish, I find some where to go
I wanna find some where
It's seems the streets, they just won't let me go
Won't let me go
Sometimes I wish, I find some where to go
I find some where to go
yeah, Ooooh, I'm searchin'
searchin' baby

[Verse 3: Gangsta Dre'sta]
Now as I lay half dead I cried
And wonder why I'ma gonna die!
Well, how hard I tried
To change and rearrange my plans to be a man
Divided we fall, united we stand
But The Lord, helped the nigga through this mess
Even though, I still got a 9 Slug in my chest
But still the nigga can walk down Kimp
Even though, my arm trims and I walk with the limb
But I'm blessed to be alive and well
Doin' swell not in jail
And damn sure not in hot hell
So next time you're comin' down my row
If it sounds to flow, I'll be prepare to go
So y'all

[Chorus: Michel'le w/ variations]
It's seems the streets, they just won't let me go
The streets won't let me go
Sometimes I wish, I find some where to go
I got to find some where 
It's seems the streets, they just won't let me go
I keep on searchin'
Sometimes I wish, I find some where to go
Awwwww yeaaaaaahhhh
It's seems the streets, they just won't let me go
The streets won't let me go
Sometimes I wish, I find some where to go
Awwwww yeaaaaaahhhh 
I've got to go some where
I've got to get away
I've got to go some where
I've got to get away
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Hey-aaaayyyyy, ooohhhh
Cause I'm searchin, I'm searchin, searchin'
Got to find a way out, I'm searchin'</pre>
