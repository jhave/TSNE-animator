Album:  Things Fall Apart
Song:   Step Into the Realm
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Chorus: repeat 4X

Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life, you'll soon depart

[Malik B]
Yo, I walk a-cross this, world that's deceptive
Beats are perfected, the ghetto's infested
with more destruction, my vocal eruption
was speakin bout corruption with no introduction
Approach me with caution cause I spark losses
M-Illitant the rap arson, marchin
Leavin niggaz stiff like I'm starchin, departin
Hollywood Sambos and jokes just like Martin
I'm the type of nigga that belongs in a ward
with a mic and a cord, to hold your head with a sword
Some proclaim lames, callin theyselves bold
They shall be flawed, when the claps applaud
If this a point of life, one I can't afford
Then I have to get sheist and I deal in fraud
Now back to the topic of, the rap philosopher
With more drama than a soap opera
Who stops the propoganda, the hot block commander
Puttin a halt to all the backtalk and slander
Warn every challenger, about the silencer
Muzzle in your mouth for the days that's on the calendar

Chorus

[Black Thought]
I'm from the valley of the heavyheads, watch the ghetto pre-medical
undergrads, and steady red faces of stone
Eyes are crevices, life like a double negative
Philly crimin-al, I rhyme my, dirt Tariq already did
Buildin this, Fifth foundation in the wilderness
Thought-less, trespass and enter Thought's fortress
Limitless entrance, paid, to the order of the
cypher slaughterer, my mic slappin you senseless
Defenseless, niggaz never movin me inches
The beat Fifth, invisi-ble in the trenches
Afficiando, awesome hip-hop drug problem
Fuck stardom, and chickens up in Gotham
Poltergeist, slit or choke the mic, til it scream to me
STOP THAT, cash we conveniently got that
I stroll through your scenery cocked back
Me and Hot Mack, the nine-eight, El Dorado Cadillac Jacks
