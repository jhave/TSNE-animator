(ODB)
I ain't no nigga

My words can't be held against me
I'm not caught up in your law

All music must obey me
All pain must obey me
I cripple my enemies
Got that careful vocabulary
I can talk my way up out of anything
Nobody's words can go against me
I'm stingy, I want all that energy
Osirus, the best nigga in the place to be
I two hundred hot degree
Burning ya til you faint y'all
Y'all niggas shooting blanks y'all
I'm fucking my vest, drive an armored tank y'all
I dead niggas like a dog buries a bone
You could never set me up I raise the pain volume
Nominate me, as presidential MC
My career so intelligent unique physique
A nigga please!

(ODB and RZA)
(Chorus)
You could never fuck with the dog,
A nigga please!
Nigga I will bury ya bone
A nigga please!
I'm the one who burned ya home
A nigga please!

Watch your shit fall like Rome
I'm immune to all viruses
I get the cocaine it cleans out my sinuses
Just for slinging *nuh* I get a quarter a mil
I'll have it raining ice drops the size of automobiles
Kill all the government microchips in my body
I'm the paranoid nigga at your party
I kill all my enemies at birth!
Shut the fuck up!
Bitch and let my slide my hands up your skirt
Nigga please!

Chorus

Nigga please!(You could never fuck with the dog)(x5)

(RZA)
Straight up! ODB type shit
Y'all watch out for the Abbott and Crazy Monk
Coming soon
Splashed y'all with the organic hip-hop spazola type
Naw mean
Straight up!
For born in on</pre>
