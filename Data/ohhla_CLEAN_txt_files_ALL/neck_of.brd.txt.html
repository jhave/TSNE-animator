[Intro]
Uptown....
Yeah...yeah..nigga
Well let me take to to the neck of the woods
In my hood (uptown)
Show you wat we livin like (uptown)
Well let me take to to the neck of the woods
In my hood (uptown)
Show you wat we livin like (uptown)

[Lil Wayne]
Shhh
Gangsta to the core
Ankle wrap flamer
Paint your kicthen floor
Wit your whore
Shit you can't ignore
Things you indore when you fuckin wit the boy
All I hear is weezy don't kill me no more
I hear your bullshit
I play mat at door
I'm not a category
I ain't there wit y'all
I got a positive vibe but I ain't scared of y'all
Git the kid nigga did never that at all
That rat a tat go off
A black kak kak kak
I gotta bitch so fine her name perrion
She no how to stash quarters in a carry on
I blow outta town
grass when I'm outta town
Uptown in the buildin not a sound
Cuz killas don't get heard about
They get whispered about
Or you get murdered out (nigga)

[Chorus: Birdman (Lil Wayne)]
Well let me take to to the neck of the woods
In my hood uptown
Show you wat we livin like
(walkin like a man
Finger on the trigger got money in my pocket
I'm a uptown nigga NIGGA!)
Well let me take to to the neck of the woods
In my hood uptown
Show you wat we livin like
(walkin like a man
Finger on the trigger got money in my pocket
I'm a uptown nigga NIGGA!)

[Birdman]
The first shot
The first nigga got shot
We bust him open like a blunt on a marley nigga (yeah)
A hundred g's
Nigga score some keys
Then we went to the hood and then we started to ball nigga (started to ball)
We know them people been paper chasin
So we stay out the way then we pull out the hardest nigga
We keep the gats close, incase you wan know
You come to the hood I bet you a target nigga
Its all good till you catch a case
A nigga never escape cuz you edicted to money nigga
Well let me bring you back yesterday
I lil homie I know got full of that barma nigga
Fuckin round wit that kid and play
Nigga fuckin wit gs a nigga twisted his body nigga
Well let me tell you bout this game I know
You keep flippin dough homie you'll be ridin the flyest nigga

[Chorus: Birdman (Lil Wayne)]
Well let me take to to the neck of the woods
In my hood uptown
Show you wat we livin like
(walkin like a man
Finger on the trigger got money in my pocket
I'm a uptown nigga NIGGA!)
Well let me take to to the neck of the woods
In my hood uptown
Show you wat we livin like
(walkin like a man
Finger on the trigger got money in my pocket
I'm a uptown nigga NIGGA!)

[Lil Wayne]
Got it on your mind let daddy say sumtin
All that play buckin
Gon get your face buttoned up
Now when you smirk
You look like jay-z's shirt
Fuckin wit that turf, I'm puffin on that smurf
Fuck it come holla and tell that poppa put away your dollas
Your son got choppas
And if you got enemies (yeah)
Your son got enemies (believe that)
That's uptown energy nigga!

[Birdman]
Don't waste no time on no bullshit
If it ain't hood shit
We spend a lil paper nigga
Well if you catch 'em in the hood nigga
It's all good shit
Go head do me that favor nigga
Well let me take you down deep in the inside
It's where they hustle and the homies try to get it right
It's when you gotta ride
It's when the homie die
And the money can't stop the pain in the inside

[Chorus: Birdman (Lil Wayne)]
Well let me take to to the neck of the woods
In my hood uptown
Show you wat we livin like
(walkin like a man
Finger on the trigger got money in my pocket
I'm a uptown nigga NIGGA!)
Well let me take to to the neck of the woods
In my hood uptown
Show you wat we livin like
(walkin like a man
Finger on the trigger got money in my pocket
I'm a uptown nigga NIGGA!)
Uptown...[repeat]
