[Busta Rhymes]
Just get off my block 
Lord Have Mercy, Busta Rhymes, Flipmode Trilogy

A yo, we ain't familiar at all nigga
Don't like, go grab your gat and lets brawl at hall nigga
Straight fallin, when we use to chill up on park benches
My 20 block radius think we need some barb wire fences
Stop bitch niggas like you from easily trespassing
Nickel nine shine on your eye then you see fire blastin
Get off my premises 
Aiyyo Lord is you a friend of his
Mouth him back to John and show this nigga just who the winner is
The presence of a small town
I diminish and blemishes
And my player amps out like a game on my little sega genesis, ha
This inappropriate
Fuck is we talkin for when we ain't even associates
Ass lyrical beatings
Straight trick or treating
What ya eatin
I ain't got no words for you 
Fuck speakinm ain't part of my crew
Face look to brand new, who?
Niggas ain't even aloud to send my pass through
Can't chill on corner can't go up in my bull digger
Chill before I call Dinco to grab the qanco sinco
We don't give a fuck right now
We be hi caliber shit
Ya'll corny niggas must bow
We do unforgivable shit
We blow the spot any how, move
Ready for battle cause I'm refusin to lose
I'ma beat ya ass in front of nobody with nuthin to prove
Live nigga shit right there
Beware, stand clear
Many y'all niggaz is welcome here

[Chorus]
Fuck is these niggas son
 Get off my block
Yo I don't know none of these niggas du
 Get off my block
Them niggas wanna sell there weed here
 Get off my block
Yo how these unfamiliar corn balls
 Get off my block
It's one of these niggas off my street corner
 Get off my block

[Lord Have Mercy]
Now who the fuck you beeeeee? Landlord
Cradle la stainless for strangers
Vigilante, trigga stampedes
On the bulletproof hooded crews
That lade this nigga ta hand breath 
Move you off the block
The unorthodox general
Flash flood when a crowd
Patriotic for the intrepid style and wreck more kids than pedophiles
Niggaaaaaaa, for ever trapped in danger
Emaciate when I take my razor
Sharp heards that scare herds
Niggaaaaa, I'm from the wicked city
When chickens twist trees and dick tease
Breast feed, Betsy's with asthmatic chest wheeze
Lord Have, cardiac arrest freeze
Please, bastard handicap crews that stay soft
It's mayor, Adolf
School your army, ya squad weak
Remove four camps when I say
Pumpin arms like nor plants
I conquer and hold
Home sweet home down with monster control
Still they in the cut like runnin the coal
And still we must bring the ruckus to all you motherfuckers
Automatically, assault and battery
We battle thieves that get tragically slap to sleep to relax the beef
Collapse like weak cancerous lungs
Scatter, we numb
Blind feelin nap with jarred villain that alarm buildings
Con scrimmage, woke up a lot of children
Dirty-ass Vietnam village
I finish and outsuns
Then fold, like Mr. Malcolm at the venetian blinds 
By all means necessary I reach for mine and
lift golden showers from roof tops
And give orders, rugged pound acre 
Drown violators in buckets of piss water

[Chorus] - repeat 3X</pre>
