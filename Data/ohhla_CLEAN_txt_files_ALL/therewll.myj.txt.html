[Chorus]
"Oh you"
"I'm comin' for ya, comin' for ya"

[Verse One] [Sunspot Jonz]
I'm comin' for ya
A motherfuckin' black warrior
Don't need no Battle Axe, Def Jux, Stone Throw ya
Don't want a brother
I'm comin' straight for ya
Slappin' bitch lawyers and promoters on the foyer
Balcony, you gon' never stop me
Cock D, straight destroyed everything
Profile on this aisle
Live baby, get down
Like Columbia, high jack a stupid bitch now
So walk man/Walkman, like the plank's made by Sony
Or any other pirate
Drop 'em to the sea
O-R-E-Y
Breathe cause I'm so fly
My nickname's Boeing 
Ride till I die
Collide on 'em right, make 'em feel blue note bitch
La la la la
We do this every night
We a team
Cut so supreme
Fake fools go last like we Capitol's yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse Two] [Luckyiam.PSC]
Effect is on
Lucky I'm a son of uhh
Back to kill it
Naw, I didn't call her a bitch, time to get it
I'm comin' for ya
Runnin' under bridges they burnin'
Can't stomach bullshit, can't be concerned with
None of that
Nonsense, options, I'm crossin' T's
And I's/eyes be PSC on that hot shit
They make me nauseous
Guard up, cautious
Mashin' through a gang of these punks like a mosh pit
I need profit
Props can't feed kids
Cops don't want peace down where we live
We live day to day to day like day day's on eighteens
We still keep 'em clean like Friday
Next, next next time I'ma beat 'em up my way
But rappers can't chunk 'em 
So momma just punk 'em
On some King James, take the lane, just dunk 'em
Put 'em on a poster
Lucky's comin' for ya
Brushin' off the parasites, hangin' on my shoulders
Playin' real life Punch Out with promoters
I try to show this
Get my motherfuckin' money
Fork it over

[Chorus]

[Verse Three] [Murs]
I'm comin' for
Runnin' for, gunnin' for
Whatever for, editor of metaphor
Competitors, I'm your apex predator
Comin' for ya, got ya number, like the creditor
I said it's war and nobody drew down
So I laid 'em flat like the perm on Dru Down
Who now?
Who's gonna step up?
I heard Murs got a brand new bitch
Shut up
Pelican mouth on a hummingbird ass
Mouth wrote a check that your butt can't cash
Flash forward, you see you can't beat the odds
Living Legends, you can't defeat the gods
Believe in yourself, don't deceive yourself
Make a plan, stick to it and receive the wealth
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse Four] [Scarub]
Life's a gamble
Without Casino, street rules
Good Fellas, like Al Pacino
And these fools?
Keep laughin'
But I ain't no comedian
I ain't no ? though
Y'all don't wanna see me when it's stand up comedy
Becomes gut bustin'
Knock out punchline, to me slap or crushin'
Keep actin' funny with me it's gonna get hilarious
Explainin' to your family what happened through parodies 
Like ha ha, half chokin', part crazy, y'all silly
Dead serious with a smile like, "Naw really"
In Living Color and I'm A Get You Sucka
Major Payne like Damon Waynes 
And y'all Dumb and Dumber at your funeral
Def Comedy Jam
I be like, "Thanks for comin' out y'all.
God Bless, good night."

"Oh you"</pre>
