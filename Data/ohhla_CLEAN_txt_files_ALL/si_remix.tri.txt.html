[Lil Wayne]
Who's that making that funky noise?
It's Weezy baby and Trine B
And it's the remix baby

[Lil Wayne]
I know what I did
And how I act
And if I see you with a man I'm a get my gat
{woop woop}
I'm just playin'
It won't be that
I got enough legal wounds
And I don't need that
And I gave you a ring that I don't need back
Because I know one day you gon be back
Not today
But one day
And my friends say I need my Beyonce
Back, like my name was Sean
I mean you stand tall
But me I lean
What's wrong?
Everything
Wayne what's right?
Wayne and Trine B
Like a string bean
Girl I'm healthy
Girl I'm lyin
Girl just help me
Help my fly
But what flight are you on?
You might not be talking bout me in this song

[Chorus]
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again

[Rick Ross]
Hold up wait a got damn minute
It aint benz then the boss ain't in it
Yeah it's dark tinted
I had to red rim in
She got the same ones
Just add the red ribbon
Sexy, like she wanna breath again, leave again
I ain't ever need a friend
Yeah I'm in the thangs
Throw away money
And I'm in the range with Floyd May money
Lord Pray for me
I'm single again
Now look who I'm mingling with
Left my baby momma
Cuz she didn't get shit
You might see her ridin' in the street
Single again

[Chorus]
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again

[Plies]
You damn right I cheated
I couldn't get it from you when I need it
Cuz dealin' with you it ain't easy
Think I'm a let you talk to me greasy
I ain't one of them little lames sweetie
So you single again?
Well we even
I know you miss how I beat it
You'll be back cuz he don't eat it

[Trina]
Got six
Run you lips 'bout that
Say Trina still the baddest
April 1st I'm back
No April Fools Joke
Finna make the world lean, hah
Hold up she back on the scene
Weez and Trine B
Plies and Rick Ross
Like Hilary Clinton
I'm the boss
Dude came back
Cuz he know where it's at
Super bubblegum brain
Tell me how you like that
I'm hotter than fish grease
Hotter than a heater
Every magazine cover you gon see Trina
Black Men magazine
King, I'm Smooth
Sister to Sister
Crip, What it do?
Thought the grass was green on the other side
Millionaires over here
We say fuck the other side
While you was out shonin
I dont know why
I stayed so alone
You couldn't say bye

[Chorus]
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again

[Trina]
Diamond Princess
Yeah
I'm still the baddest
ha ha ha

I'm single again
I'm single again

[Chorus]
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again</pre>
