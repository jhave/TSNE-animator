[Chorus]
I'ma winner {*repeat 4X*}
("I'ma winner in bed")
I'ma winner {*repeat 4X*}
("I'ma winner in bed")
When I get you in the bed ("I'ma break 'em off")
Off a shot off Patron-ah ("All night long")
Takin yo' clothes off ("When I get you home")
When I pull the thang out ("The girls moan")
When I get you in the bed ("I'ma break 'em off")
Off a shot off Patron-ah ("All night long")
Takin yo' clothes off ("When I get you home")
When I pull the thang out...

[Twista]
Shorty when I saw your body
You was killin everything in the party
steady trippin while I'm sippin on Bacardi
Look at the fatty on the cute lil hottie
Let me whisper in your ear like Ying Yang
Let a nigga get a shot like King James
I hit it from the back and be the best
When it come to sex a motherfucker got a mean name
First I pull up in a Rolls
Then I get you up out them clothes
Strike a motherfuckin pose
Then I hit you in the hole with the soul pole
Do you like the way I suck them titties
Do you like it when you in my city
Do you like it when you giggle with the Twista
When I get you in the bed hoes be on flip

[Hook]
When I get you in the room I'ma ("Make you moan")
When I get you on the couch I'ma ("Make you moan")
Once I get you in the telly I'ma ("Make you moan")
I don't make you say ouch I'ma ("Make you moan")
When I get you in the Bentley I'ma ("Make you moan")
When I get you in the Benz I'ma ("Make you moan")
You be tellin all your friends how I ("Make you moan")
...
When I hit it from the back I'ma ("Make you moan")
When I hit it from the side I'ma ("Make you moan")
When I hit it from the front I'ma ("Make you moan")
If you fin' to take a ride I'ma ("Make you moan")
If you suck my {dick} I'ma ("Make you moan")
If I lick yo' {clit} I'ma ("Make you moan")
If I hit it like this I'ma ("Make you moan")
If you fuckin with the Twista girl you know that...

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Girl I bet you got a heart of fire
You make me wanna start a fire
Dish me the ass like Nash
I'ma go to the hole like Stoudamire
Fill it up if I'ma take it to the cup
If you feelin freaky take it in the butt
If you really wanna do somethin
Come an' deep throat me gul and take it to the nuts
I like the way you walk in Capris
You put a hurtin on all these fe's
Thick fat ass, make a nigga
wanna come up out the pocket with all these G's
When I tap it I can make you whine
When I tap it I can make you zone
When I tap it I can make you cry
If you want to I can take you home

[Hook] - sub "house" for "room"

[Chorus]

[Twista]
I like when you make that sound
I like how you take that down
I love the way you hit it a lil' bit harder
The way you make that frown
I like it when you backin it up on me
I like the way you ride it like a pony
I like the way you drippin it for daddy
Come and trickle it up on my homey
I like it when you trippin in the club
When you sip a little bub feelin good wit'cha homegirls
It's all the way queens dress nice
You be stricken off the ice, you can look but don't touch
I can make you feel good
when I'm freakin on yo' body and I get up in the womb
I'ma always love
bringin pressure to a girl 'til I get up in the tomb

[Hook]
