[Nelly]
Welcome to Nellyville, where all newborns get a half-a-mill'
Sons, get the tan DeVille, soon as they can reach the wheel
And daughters, get diamonds the size of their age - help me out now
One year get one carat, two years get two carats
Three years get three carats, and so on into marriage
Nobody livin average, everybody jang-a-lang
Nobody livin savage, e'rybody got change
Even the paperboy deliver out the back of a Range
It's not a game, it's a beautiful thang
Imagine blocks and blocks of no cocaine, blocks with no gunplay
Ain't nobody shot, so ain't no news that day
Ain't nobody snitchin, they refuse to say
Every month - we take a vote on what the weather should be
And if we vote it rains - know how wet we want it to be
And if we vote it snow - know how deep we want it to get
But the sun gon' shine 99 percent, in Nellyville

[Chorus]
There's no.. way.. I.. I could explaiiiiin..
the way I feel right now
There's no.. way.. I.. I could explaiiiiin..
the way I feel about livin in Nellyville

[Nelly]
I got that good at e'ry gas station, pull on up
Give me a half a ounce of that shit, fill it up
We got straws for the bottles, outlaw the cups
And we gon' make it happen, ain't no need for no luck
Ain't no lotteries, no pick 3's or pick 2's
Keep the money in your family, gamble amongst your crew
Cause the dice gon' do what the dice gon' do
And if you take a life, you gon' lose yours too
Ain't no trials, it's automatic, you drop 'em right where it happen
You do unto others if you don't want it don't do the cappin
Think that's cool?  40 acres and a mule
Fuck that!  Nellyville - 40 acres and a pool
Six bedrooms, full bath with a jacuzz'
Six-car garage, pavement smooth
Both front and back deck 'nough room to land a jet
And you ain't reached the city, that's just the projects

[Chorus]

[Nelly] Everybody, uh, now everybody say

[Interlude]
Well I want to go, please let me go
I need to go - down to Nellyville
I need to see, what I can say
Won't you and me - go to Nellyville
I want to go, so bad
I just want to go and look
Won't you please take me on in
I just know I gotta be there

[Nelly]
No unexpectancy, like teenage pregnancy
And physical mental attraction your only ecstasy
Your own destiny, create your own recipe
If you ain't livin accordin to dirty then you stressin me
"And who are you?"  Who me?  I'm the mayor
And any problems you got, I live up thurr
"Where's that?"  The house on the hill, welcome mat of fur
When you pass by that thang, be polite and don't sturr

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah
There's no.. way.. yeah
There's no.. way.. yeah
There's no.. way.. yeah
There's no.. way..</pre>
