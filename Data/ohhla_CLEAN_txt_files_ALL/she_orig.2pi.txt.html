I know she got it cause she lookin' at me like she want it (Want it)
She drop it low, maybe wanna throw some D's on it (Hey!)

[Verse 1: 2 Pistols {T-Pain in background}]
Excuse moi, let me talk to you for a second
Little mama so fine she got the whole squad sweatin' (DAYMN!)
"How you fit all that in them jeans?"
Was the question that I asked
Followed by "Let me buy you a drink" (Drink)
Young boss baby, I treat you
Treat you to the finer things
The neck bling, wrist bling
Wedding ring (Nah, I'm playin')
Might light ya neck or your wrist
But you gotta ride a nice dick and, uh
Take trips with the bricks (Hey yeah)
"She got it {She got it}
She got it"
That's what Pain said {She got it}
Them other niggas lame man, little mama, I got the game plan
2 Pistols, bein' your boss
I make it happen while they talk
Ridin' 6's while they walk

[Chorus]

Break:
[T-Pain]    Oooh (Hey!)
            Oooh (Hey!)
            She got it (She got it)
[2 Pistols] She got it, she got it
[T-Pain]    Oooh (Hey!)
            Oooh (Hey!)
            She got it (She got it)
[2 Pistols] She got it, she got it
[T-Pain]    Shawty know she's got it (Oooh, yeah)
            Got it, got it, got it (Oooh, yeah)
            She got it (She got it)
[2 Pistols] She got it, she got it
[T-Pain]    Shawty know she's got it (Oooh, yeah)
            Got it, got it, got it (Oooh, yeah)
            She got it (She got it)
            She got it

[Verse 2: 2 Pistols]
Damn, she bad (Damn, she bad)
Damn, she thick (Yes indeed)
Five foot five, hazel eyes, redbone, you da shit (Shit)
Make a nigga wanna stop and stare (Stare)
I just wanna pull your hair
Freaky shit, kinky shit
You don't need to take it there
I'm a young boss, girl (Girl)
Let me upgrade ya (Ya)
He's a worker, I get work out, what you 'bout, girl (Girl)
Trips to Venice (Venice)
What's the bid'ness (Bid'ness)
Bet this, swiss the digits
And the rest is history
