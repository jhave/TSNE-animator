There we go right there, ok were on the air
Let's go

We grew up with showbusiness on our mind
In hope to make a big name
Thats why me and my sister was a stiff competition
Show off when company came
Nothing but little, cause I was too shy
Stupid in front of the rest of the family
SHAKE THAT ASS!
Although my sister was the one with the beautiful voice
I still had to go last
Everybody wait, now I'm a cut the fools
The nigga laughing, acting goofy
I either came in the room when everybody go bye
And do the Michael Jackson and just act stupid
But lately, me and my people ain't been havin' to many family groupin's
Or maybe, it just some times heard a sweet melody of my baby who be
You was there through the struggle
As y'all come and try to reach the big picture
I'm tellin' ya
It hurt when you plan to do something with somebody you love
When it's time to do it, they can't be with you
I'm feelin' guilty to take it there, but better since you been gone
Well no matter
Must we fix up the furniture ain't the same when you ain't home baby
I'm 'a miss you forever, forget you never
But you gonna see the world through my eyes
And live what I never saw
So if you can see me way from Heaven, over the cloud
You could be proud of your little brother, so look down and smile

Shine my lady, I miss you baby
For your my baby, my love is crazy
Your my sister, I'll always miss you
No one can get ya', cause God is with ya'
Shine my lady, I miss you baby
For your my baby, my love is crazy
There's no other, it's from your brother
Your son and mother, cause we all love ya'

All the sad songs in the world
Probably couldn't express how much I miss my baby
I just thank God that I had a big sister
The 29 beautiful years that he gave her
Even the days when I misbehaved
And I knew she was gonna get that belt to pop me
I could see the aggrivation in your face
My momma said that they had to watch me
"Michelle, if you go somewhere, take Michael with you"
Know what that meant
All up and down the house trying to find how your time gonna be spent
Cause I was too hard-headed
Everywhere you said "Don't go", thats where I went
Always flipping, jumping around like a jackass, 
somewhere climbing a fence
Bring me my Rocking Robin, my double dutch bust
She had some song to sang for us, we had some name brands to discuss
Plus, I want to tell her I was sorry for leaving the toilet seat up
And not cleaning out the tub, and leaving peanut butter and jelly
And drinking out the Kool-Aid jar
I pissed you off, burned you up
When you told me "Cut that music down", I turned it up
Bickering conflict cause y'all doubt how we showed out love
You was my flesh and blood, we was brother and sister
And it meant so much
Now I'm doing it, you supposed to be here
We supposed to be righting songs together
I'm telling ya', that girl tore talent shows up
But owned Tina Marie records
What you left us with, never be in vain
You gonna be shining, and they gonna know your name
Too many damn things left unexplained
But since you was an angel down here, 
then an angel there you shall remain
And thats always until my time, you're my strength, you're my life
Shine
