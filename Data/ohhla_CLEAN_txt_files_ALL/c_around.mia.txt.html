[M.I.A. - Chorus]
Check my coat in and I paid the dollar
Sidekick rings - "What's up? Holla!"
Text the address - 'I'll see you later!'
Baby, come down!
Come down, come down, come down
Run down, run down, run down
Run, make a run, make a run, make a run
Make a run, make a run, make a run down
A dun da da dun da da dun da da dun da da dun dun 
Dun da da dun da da dun dun
Beat goes on
A dun da da dun da da dun, dun da da dun da da dun dun
Dun da da dun da da dun dun
Beat goes on

[M.I.A. - Verse 1]
In a faraway land, we got shit made
Ray-Ban shades, warheads laid
Babies born in air raids
My girls run The Everglades
Indian tribesmen, gamble spades
Indian chicks, they get men laid!
Milk and honey, smoke high-grade
Gold and diamond, gems and jade
Ride up on our tanks - Invade!
Blow up things to save our name
Mina, Rina, Tina, Sabrina
Being a super-Indian babe
We black market, we black made
We hit shit out when it rains!
Would you come down and catch my train?
Would you run down and play this game?

[M.I.A. - Chorus]
Check my coat in and I paid the dollar
Sidekick rings - "What's up? Holla!"
Text the address - 'I'll see you later!'
Baby, come down!
Come down, come down, come down
Run down, run down, run down
Run, make a run, make a run, make a run
Make a run, make a run, make a run down
A dun da da dun da da dun da da dun da da dun dun 
Dun da da dun da da dun dun
Beat goes on
A dun da da dun da da dun, dun da da dun da da dun dun
Dun da da dun da da dun dun
Beat goes on 

[Timbaland - Verse 2]
Hey, hey! 
Baby girl, you and me, need to go to your teepee
The moon is full, and I'm shining
Baby, I know you see me!
Put a hump or two on your back, just like that
Ooh, girl you're on fire!
I don't wanna be in love wit cha
I'mma just break you off and say goodbye
The night is young, don't make me wait
You just might miss your chance
I'm gonna tell you the truth
Timbaland, I'm the motherfuckin' man!
Today's the day - girl, let me get that!
Don't get mad - in fact, let me hit that!
I've been overkillin' them - I break backs!
Come down, run down - girl, where your place at?

[M.I.A. - Chorus]
Check my coat in and I paid the dollar
Sidekick rings - "What's up? Holla!"
Text the address - 'I'll see you later!'
Baby, come down!
Come down, come down, come down
Run down, run down, run down
Run, make a run, make a run, make a run
Make a run, make a run, make a run down
A dun da da dun da da dun da da dun da da dun dun 
Dun da da dun da da dun dun
Beat goes on
A dun da da dun da da dun, dun da da dun da da dun dun
Dun da da dun da da dun dun
Beat goes on

[Timbaland - Interlude]
Break! Ha! Ha!
Hands up in the air one time!
And bounce, bounce, bounce
Let me tell you somethin'

[Timbaland - Outro]
Don't get it twisted, baby girl
Baby boy, 'cause Timbaland ain't dead
Don't get it twisted, baby girl
Baby boy, 'cause Timbaland ain't dead 
Don't get it twisted, baby girl
Baby boy, 'cause Timbaland ain't dead
Don't get it twisted, baby girl
Baby boy, 'cause Timbaland ain't dead
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Bounce, 'cause Timbaland ain't dead!</pre>
