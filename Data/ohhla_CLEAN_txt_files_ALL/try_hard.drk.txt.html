[Verse 1: Drake]
Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get tosnapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
Symbolic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
It's a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected, people just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics 
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
Niggas wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
that you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town

Chorus: (x4)
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try

[Verse 2: Drake]
And the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spitting' isfresher 
than most of these rappers running the game
Concerned that people who copy what's in the past and turn the profit with cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a range, Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
and watched the gamefrom the bleachers
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
I wasted late out at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on thewinner 
so this album is a labor of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money onbeats 
That she can rest without a toss and a turn
Because she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned
But I'm gonna try to..

Chorus: (x4)
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try</pre>
