Doo wah diddy diddy diddy dum diddy doo
(God damn, it's some honkies in this motherfucker tonight
Doo wah diddy diddy dum diddy doo
Oh oh oh ah yeah
(You motherfuckers came anyway, huh)

[Brother Marquis]
I met this bitch standing on the block
Singing doo wah diddy diddy dum diddy doo
She'll suck on my dick if I buy her a rock
Doo wah diddy diddy dum diddy doo
Got the pussy (got the pussy)
She got jacked (she got jacked)
Punched her face (punched her face)
And I took my money back

[Luke]
I was walking down the street when I met this lula
Singing doo wah diddy diddy dum diddy doo
She had a mouthpiece and a nice soup cooler
Doo wah diddy diddy dum diddy doo
She sucked my dick (sucked my dick)
Licked my balls (licked my balls)
Kissed my ass (kissed my ass)
Goddamn, this bitch'll do it all

[Brother Marquis]
I met this bitch at a quarter past 12
Singing doo wah diddy diddy dum diddy doo
When I took her ass home the pussy smelled like hell
Singing doo wah diddy diddy dum diddy doo
Summer's Eve (Summer's Eve)
Massengil (Massengil)
Wash your pussy (wash your pussy)
Bitch kill that funky smell

[Luke]
I saw this bitch walking down the block
Singing doo wah diddy diddy dum diddy doo
Between her legs she had a big red spot
Doo wah diddy diddy dum diddy doo
Was it cum? (was it cum)
Was it blood? (was it blood)
My nigga (my nigga)
My nigga, I don't know what the fuck it was

[Brother Marquis]
I met this girl and she tried to act shitty
Singing doo wah diddy diddy dum diddy doo
She was from the projects of Liberty City
Doo wah diddy diddy dum diddy doo
Bangkok (Bangkok)
Rag top (rag top)
Cross me (cross me)
And bet your ass you'll get drepped

[Luke]
I saw this fag tricking at the bus stop
Singing doo wah diddy diddy dum diddy doo
I said you sissy motherfucker you know you oughta stop
Singing doo wah diddy diddy dum diddy doo
Spreading AIDS (spreading AIDS)
Punk bitch (punk bitch)
Watching dick (watching dick)
You know a real nigga ain't about all that shit</pre>
