Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yo 777 reasons why I don't need to talk to no other female
Everybody gotta a baby
This right here is for MINE
Cuz thats my baaaabbbbyyyy
Yeah come on
I was looking for a chick
Who was trying to have something
Stak somethin
Leave in the mornin bring back something
Old lady trapped in a young girls body
Body of a grandaughter heart of a grandmother
Found her and we stunted on the town it was cute watchin baby girl spend out
Ill have this one that one the white one the black one and do you have the slacks that match that one?
Little did she know that it was an investment Imma spend the rest of my life with this bitch
She call my name wake me up from nightmares
I return and feel her laying right there
Noone else can fatheron what I've been through
Let alone understand what it turned me into
I don't seek the apporveal of any woman but YOU
Ain't no two ways to explain it Baby
I just love you

Who knew the day I met you?
You would be the one
Who knew that be the day that our dating days were done?
Boyfriend girlfriend engagement wedding
And you must've went crazy thinking I'm playing bout my baby
Cuz thats my Baaaabbbbbyyyy
Thats my baby

Who knew the day I met you
You would be the one
Who knew that'd be the day that our dating days were gone
Boyfriend girlfriend engagement wedding and you must've went crazy thinking I'm playin bout my baby
Thats my baby shes my baby

Your heart doesn't beat it just pounds ur chest
What man before me knew the sound of your breasts
I fall asleep to the sound of your breath
Imma give you what time I got left

Through sickness and health
Till death due us part
No one can cross you
My baby my heart
No distinction between us together we're one
Two lives combined now look what we done
I drive to the house
Passing horses and cows
What cant be done with you holding me down
Put that ring on my finger and started it new

They say that I'm better
Then charge it to you
You fell in love with a plum damn fool
Then stood behind me like family Boo
From lora mays funeral to kew kews birth
It didn't matter what you wanted cuz I had to want it 1st baby
Who knew the day I met you?
You would be the one,
Who knew that be the day that our dating days were done?
Husband wife n house n children
And you must've went crazy thinking I'm playing bout my baby
Cuz thats my Baaaabbbbbyyyy
Thats my baby
Shes my babyyyyyyyyyyy
Thats my babyyyy
Your love makes me wanna make money but more importantly makes me
Wanna save money
If something happens to me give it to the babies for me
Your heart is mine and never let anyone take it from me
Your love make me wanna be careful make me wanna slow down
Cuz I gotta grow now
Cuz I gotta be here just to get old now
Never wanna see you without somebody to hold now
No woman in my life has ever affected me
Its not like I choose you
Its like you selected me
N you gonna spend life till the death of me
Success and we got the recipe
She was everything that I had to pray for
We get to fighting and she wonders why she stayed for
We prayed together stayed together
And went through it like mosley and mayweather together
But thats my baby

Who knew the day I met you
You would be the one
Who knew that'd b the day that our dating days were done
Husband wife n house n children
And you must've went crazy thinking I'm playing bout my baby
Cuz thats my Baaaabbbbbyyyy
Thats my baby
Shes my babyyyyyyyyyyy</pre>
