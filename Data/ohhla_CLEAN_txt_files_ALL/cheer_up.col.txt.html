Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I'm high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I'm getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know

[Verse 1]
Yeah school girl, cool girl
Your dress is sexy and your momma is a cougar
So she let you do the grown folk's thing
Let you hang with them boys and they play you like a fool girl
You got your new hair, it looks so good
You write the same nigga's name in your notebook
You know the same one from class, the one you let smash
Now you see him round school and he won't look
Now girl you is fine, ain't no doubt about it
But why else you think he hit it and forgot about it
That's cause your mind don't match with your ass got
But cheer up you gotta be your own mascot
You see you're looking for a man like you need somebody
Get your ass off of Twitter you could be somebody
A doctor, a rock star, baby live life
But you'd rather wet up all your pillows all night thinking

[Chorus]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I'm high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I'm getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know
It's all I know
It's all I know
It's all I know
It's all I
Ay cheer up
And lil mama cheer up
You got your whole life to live
Ay why you wanna tear up
Don't let them little boys... when they try to push up
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
Don't even wanna get out the bed
I got the glock to my head feel I'd rather be dead
And am I hopeless, raised with rats and roaches
Never liked the teachers, couldn't stand my coaches
Ask what's the matter but you can't relate
Living a life that you hate but you can't escape
Feel like I'm stuck here
That's why I don't give a fuck here
There's no luck here, nobody to trust here
My own mother yeah I love her but things I heard as a child under my covers
Left me with scars it was hard to see her suffer
Ducking my heart and I don't know if I'll recover
I'm going under and as I'm headed out the front door
She say she proud of me and I wonder what for
And once more

[Chorus]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I'm high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I'm getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know
It's all I know
It's all I know
It's all I know
It's all I
Ay cheer up
And lil mama cheer up
You got your whole life to live
Ay why you wanna tear up
Don't let them little boys... when they try to push up
Hey, hey...</pre>
