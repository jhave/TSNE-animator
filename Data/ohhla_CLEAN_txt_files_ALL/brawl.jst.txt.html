[Intro: King Just]
Ladies and gentlemen, from out the group from Shaolin
We have, his royal high, King Just

[Chorus: King Just (?)]
I make, you take, I create, you entertained
Make, no, mistake at all (We came back, cuz they had my back against
the wall, brawl)
What do you see in me (brawl), do ya'll think you can (brawl) crawl
(brawl, brawl)

[King Just]
They had me stuck on the corner, you know solo in the avenue
Where jakes harass you, and barbeques try to bag you
Where niggas snappin' you, you know bitches got attitudes
When niggas hustle like the life, like it's all natural
Blood attracting those that have love for the music
I taught em how to put it down, I showed 'em how to use it
Some did it to do it, some still persued it
And others that never had it don't know what to do with it
Losing it, before you get a grip on life
Raw nights, smoke mics like crack dude's pipe
Fuck tight, Mr. Exciter, making it nice
Shop light, how bright, me and Taylor's still tight
Got to fight for my life, for that sword that I got
Won't be satisfied til I gat a mansion and a yacht
Paid for, with my own KJ store
But until then, Monday Night Brawl, Brawl

[Chorus]

[King Just]
They say he's washed up, I guess that means he's clean
Cuz all I heard 'em chase was a dollar and a dream
A little cappucin', and a beam to steam
Early morning motivation to get this CREAM
Get the newspaper, huddle up and check with the team
To the left, hear your debts, now I'm talking to fiend
Got that dope shit man, it'll make you lean
Even got booster roosters that be bringing me jeans
By all mean, I stay in between the scenes
Now it's me that you see on your wide ass screen
Where's my canteen, man, I got a thirst to quench
Mr. All Time Scorer, why you off the bench
I can really care less if you take offense
My defense'll have you jump back over the fence
Intense moment, doggone it, like you really really want it
For my album, I got layaway, put five on it!

[Chorus]

[King Just]
I ain't had a good laugh in a long fucking time
And if time is money, then ya'll don't need to rhyme
Fine, I guess you got money to lose
How could you win this game, if a name don't rule
Still paying dues, and I ain't get back shit
Broke like Hammer, but I'm 'too legit to quit'
All in the mix and you don't know the flavor
Don't rap like Will Smith, but I want a wife like Jada
No more player, I signed up for the coach
Quote, Staten Island Ferryboat flow
Wrote what was written, once twice bitten
Stay shitting, while these hits keep hitting
Finger licking, and I ain't talking bout chicken
It ain't worth sticking, til the plot thickens
Charles Dickens of rap, the number one seller
You can brawl to the music or brawl acapella, but brawl

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
