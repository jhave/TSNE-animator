[Daz Dillinger]
Hey! What the fuck is up!
You know what time it is up in this BEITCH!
Dat, Nigga, DAZZZZZZZZZZ

[Chorus]
What'chu know (what'chu know) about that (about that) - {*3X*}
... about that, what'chu know about that

[Daz Dillinger]
When you see me comin nigga, you know it's not a dream
Get your guns out, blast at your motherfuckin team
Fuck a triple beam, it's digital now
I'm a real gangsta nigga, come check my profile
Chop it up, chop it up, chop up the work (work)
Everybody 'round here goin all berzerk (zerk)
Check him on the chirp, get a quote for it
Whether they rock it up, or the fiends snort it
Either way I'ma stay paid, whether or not
'Til then I'ma knock the hardest nigga on your block
Your homeboy got knocked out
The young niggaz 'round us, that's what they about (about)
We get {?}, get that, we die and we multiply
West coast, niggaz yeah we ride
Ride and let it slide, {?}
Motherfuckers out when we both collide, all y'all know

[Chorus] - 2X

[Daz Dillinger]
What'chu know about six-fo' dippin (dippin)
What'chu know about West coast rippin (WEST COAST~!)
What'chu know about a nigga on the grind
What'chu know about a nigga when he shine
What'chu know about gettin yo' ass beatdown
All the way down to the motherfuckin ground
What'chu know about cappin a rat
What'chu know about stackin them stacks
Tell me somethin different, I'll tell you wrong
Niggaz don't last long, niggaz gotta stay strong
This what I know, I'm back in the game
Since I peeped game, shit won't be the same
Don't you know about packin them gats (brrrrrrrrap)
Don't you know about bustin a cap
Don't you know about D-A-Z
Motherfucker, you know I'm from the D-P-G

[Chorus] - 2X

[Daz Dillinger]
Well I was walkin down the street boppin my head to the beat
While my JVC's vibrate the concrete
Dank fell out of my pocket and I picked it back up
The policeman said FREEZE, put your hands up
What'd I do, I think about that and I bust back
Fuck that, get this pig capped
Dippin down the boulevard, whippin and I'm hittin cars
Diggy Daz the rap star, up for a murder charge
In cell, {?}
What a fuckin threat, yo a nigga's soakin wet
What about it, you know I'm stuck between a hard rock
Me and the cop, or bein free just to rule the block
A lesson to be learned, the weak get burned
Whatever you didn't earn'll turn back on yo' ass when it turns
Now quit it I admit it that I didn't did it
If I admit it I wouldn't be acquitted

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
