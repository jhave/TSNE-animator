[Intro]
Don't, stop! {*4X*}

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, Bad and Evil is (BACK~!)

Uhh, we 'bout to get into a tale of a gunner that details the dungeon
Just as the pale moon illuminates the hail and thunderin
'01's the year where I fell from blunderin
Shady lifted his wing then I fell from under it
Now I'm free-fallin, my career has gone into recallin
Regardless of who's fault I was speed ballin
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Then Marshall double backed and got me from on top of a hearse
I'm alive nigga
Justin T. ain't got nothin on me cause I done cried Mary J. Blige rivers
I realized that God's with us
Soon as I decided to put that bottle down and, pick up my Todd Bridges
The writin's on the wall - since niggaz seen me 
at the baseball game with Shady and Jay-Z, suddenly everybody calls
Like, "I'm just checkin on you dawg"
While I throw up this message on the stall

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
When them bottles stop poppin and them dollars start stoppin
Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't, stop!)
I made a promise to my momma, I'ma out-live her
How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop? (don't, stop!)
I'm livin proof nigga, it's pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away (don't, stop!)
It's the worldwide American way
I'm livin proof nigga (don't, stop!)

[Eminem]
Your body language is sayin your confidence is gone
Well pick ya ass up lil' homie, come on
You just gon' sit there and take it or make 'em suck it?
Tell 'em where to shove it
Straight up, you gon' make love to the world or you gon' FUCK it?
The last time that life kicked me in the ass
I pulled down its pants and put a foot up its ass
Man what a catastrophe it'd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy
and not open a can of whoop-ass, let you pissants whoop me
would be the day I say I ate poop
Shit, the day that I don't straight shoot I'll drop out of my anti-woman hate group
Say I'm a sissy faggot, record it, play it back and put it on straight loop
You haters look like you ate a grapefruit!
You see me climbin back on that wagon, got my swagger back, I was draggin
Hopped back on it, grabbed the reigns on that bastard
and came back on 'em without remorse, man of course
I'm a one-trick pony, cause I'll be screamin on these whores 'til I'm hoarse/horse!

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Nah, I ain't fadin yet
I'd rather stay and rap, I mighta made a debt
But I find excitement in wonderin what I'ma write next
so I don't stay in debt
Me broke? You might as well cut the embryo out of my momma and play catch
with the baby with AK's with baby bayonets
I'ma get rich or I'ma die tryin
That's why it's either kill or be killed so call me suicide homicide Ryan

[Eminem]
There's a bomb inside my head, I'm a live wire
I am on the edge, teeterin on it like a totter, I might 
get on a nut like a tire iron; I have no desire stoppin
So why would I drop and roll? That's how much on fire I AM!
Rappers are fun and I'm the time cause I'm just flyin by 'em
And I'm laughin at 'em the entire time, why am I up?
Cause tribulations I have triumphed, bitch I'm fired up
So one time for me just let your fuckin lighters light the SKY UP~!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Don't, stop! {*4X*}</pre>
