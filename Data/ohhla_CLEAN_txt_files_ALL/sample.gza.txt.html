Verse one:

The amplified sample, will trample, the leading cancel
That vacate your vessel
Guide this, strenuous as an arm wrestle
Move swift as light, a thousand years in one night
Then flight with insight
Everything i thought of, I saw it happen
Then I rose from the soil to sun blacken
Then came rao czars, left tracks and scarred
A pair of brightness of exploding stars
Gave me goods to taste
No ingredients to traced
And remained stuffed trying to figure the shape of space
No edge or boundary, released 2 rounds or 3
Intimidate my razor scrape, phony clown MC
The physical shatter from the blast
Pierclastic flow sets of a tower of ash
Through ignorance and misplaced trust your world's crushed
Too late to activate hyperspace of thrust
Even wearing camoflauge the analog at war
He seen his high beems
The father came in accompianed by deadly rain and when
Mentally indowed when lighting hit the crowd
The warm side crushed the barrier
The storm side destroyed your area

Repeat verse

The amplified sample, will trample, the leading cancel
That vacate your vessel

The amplified sample, the amplified sample, the amplified sample
Will trample

The amplified sample, will trample, the leading cancel
That vacate your vessel

The amplified, the amplified sample

The amplified sample, the amplified

The amplified sample, will trample, the leading cancel

The amplified

The amplified sample, will trample, the leading cancel

The amplified, the amplified 

The amplified sample (fade out)</pre>
