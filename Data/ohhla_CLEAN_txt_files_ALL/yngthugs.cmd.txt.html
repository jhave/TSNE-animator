(talking)(popeye)
Don't real niggas die, in god we return, 
but respect the real though, feel that

Chorus: Young Thugs 

You better watch your back before you get yourself mugged
'Cause niggas 'round here ain't gon' show u no love
Them niggas ain't no friend to you
All them niggas wanna do is put a end to you
 
(verse 1: C-Murder)
Look at the future, look into the eyes of the men that might shoot ya
Even your best friend might do ya
Why take a chance on a man just because he shake your hand
Them same niggas kill for a grand and i don't understand
All that friendship shit is played out
You better wake up before you be layed out
I know u smoke weed with'em and you trust'em like your brother
But he ain't your brother 
Nigga listen to your mother
You walk around like you big and bad nigga
If you was in jail you might be fag nigga
How can i love you, you don't love yourself
You play the game raw fool and its bad for your health

(chorus) (2x)

(verse 2: Hollaway of the GC's)
Now whats a friend what a patner
How do tell who's an imposter
A nigga you see rarely could be diggin down your bitch daily, 
it scares me
My little brothers in that situation
Ther's clowns hangin' round because there's paper in this occupation
I done warned ya, the same one you tote wit'
Sell your little dope wit'
Or get your fuckin' throat slit
Wanna be a hustler nigga? holla at me, there's rules to the game
First of all don't FUCK wit' the lame
I used to hit the block, glock cock stone in my matchbox
Hollerin' at them hoes 
Pullin' flights on po-pos
But now im Hollaway
With the GC's until my diein' day
There's freedom on the streets if you cherish it try to stay

(chorus) (2x)

(verse 3: Popeye)
Think about when I stood that may be left when i was foldin' my few
Just tryin' to see who lyin' me when i was told that i knew
Boldin' my crew between the edge of my future with no return
On any hella-heart in the flesh but no concern, burn
Rainy nights and waterfalls
To walk away on a date my daughter call
Y'all tryin' make a way to slaughter y'all 
Even though we held up rukus before the battle
Made it through pistol poppin' unlockin' i saw your shadow standin'
next to me wit just a clip
Flallin' beside me couldn't resist to flip
You held me down but yet we missed a ship
Reachin' out abusin' my purpose to guide the night crew
Notice that I'm a part of your blood and what i might do

(chorus) (4x) </pre>
