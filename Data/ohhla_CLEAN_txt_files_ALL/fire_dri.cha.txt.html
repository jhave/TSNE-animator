[Chamillionaire]
Hustlin the grands, hustle cause I can
Hustle like my mother was in love with rubber bands
Russia and Japan, Russia pass the fans
I am not a sucker, sucker mother was a Stan
I ain't never ran, I am number tan
If ten is meaning best then we are votin who the man
Jumpin out the Lam-borghini, they like damn
Wanna be like him so I can get me one of them
I ain't gon' pretend, gun it never jam
Cadillac the truck, I got another that's sedan
Money come from Pam, money come to hand
That's the bitches manager, I want her, I'ma span
Ask me where I been, I've been spending Ben
Franklins and swangin, gettin mileage on my Benz
I ain't gon' pretend, I ain't one of them
People that be fake, so effort, I don't want a friend

The industry is saying that boy got skills
And the streets is saying that boy so real
Who that boy trackin that boy Chamill'?
Always give you somethin that boys gon' feel</pre>
