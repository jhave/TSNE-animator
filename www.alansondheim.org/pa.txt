Droste and Berber in rehearsal
never before released footage from the original production
with new tabla accompaniment especially commissioned
by the hairs of Droste and Berber
cut off from the bodies of Droste and Berber
as well as accompanying avatars created from cloth and wire
held in suspension creating a perfect framework
for this first time and perhaps only this time
a framework where Berber first sadly languished
then rose to the occasion of Droste's bizarre accompaniment
this silent film direct from the Weimar era
salvaged from numerous bunkers of works of tired cinema
lay sadly in shadows where reels of film were found
presented now almost in their pristine original condition

the hairs of Droste and Berber were tangled sadly
among the reels where memories of Droste and Berber
languished among the clubs of old Berlin

dance

to do some nude work, the 'tethering' pieces, if you're up to it, no pun 
intended. the camera-woman would also be nude; you and i would be tethered 
together, my hand pulling your member, your hand pulling mine - two 
sections or episodes. you'd dance, furious, try to get away, to come 
close, to twist, to turn, either your hand or your member would refuse the 
motion, hold you pack, collapse culture, return to the swarm. there's a 
mirror; all of us, including the woman appear; it's as if we're competing 
for her; as if she's withdrawn; as if she's seeing everything; as if 
everything's exposed to her; as if she's the last woman on earth; as if 
we're on stage; as if we're staging this; as if we're one and splitting; 
as if we're drawn into each other; as if we're split into one; as if we're 
opening up; as if we're closing down; as if we're body to her techne or 
techne to her body; as if i'm holding you back; as if you want to go 'with 
the others'; as if the others have disappeared; as if you're used to it; 
as if i'm desperate; as if i'm holding your member; as if you're afraid of 
that; as if you're holding my member; as if i'm afraid of that; as if i'm 
holding your member; as if i'm afraid of that; as if you're holding my 
member; as if you're afraid of that; the woman's afraid of nothing; the 
woman's the intransitive; the woman's the fulcrum; the apex; the nadir; 
the woman's the absent locus; our members compete for the woman; our hands 
hold our members back; my hand refuses the presence of your member (for 
the woman); your hand refuses the presence of my member (for the woman); 
you're dancing; i'm awkward holding on; your graceful holding on; you're 
in some other space; i'm in the space of my member; two episodes: we're 
nude, standing - my right hand is holding your semi-erect member tight; 
you're dancing, tethered; the dance conforms to tethering; there's no 
escaping for five minutes - then your right hand is holding my semi-erect 
member tight; your dancing, tethering me; i'm held there; the dance 
conforms to the holding; there's no escaping for five minutes; there's one 
then the other; there's the other then the one; the woman is holding the 
camera; the camera is running; the camera is running and not stopping; the 
camera keeps running the length of the episodes; the camera runs ten 
minutes; the camera runs twelve minutes; the camera runs before the 
beginning and through the episodes; the camera runs after the ending; the 
camera is running

Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to Alan
Happy birthday to me

from the 406 manatees killed this year
from the starving polar bears
from the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi dead
from the victims of famine and hurricanes
from those slaughtered by death squads
from my dead mother
from those born of tornados and floods
from those, those burned alive
Happy birthday to me



from my partner and friends
Happy birthday to me

It's always in the peripheral that accidents occur, organisms are born. 
You can hunt anywhere, you can hunt online. Ghosts are here, their images 
trapped, evanescent. Always present, always lost, the very thickness of 
our flesh at stake.

ghost ghostrap disappearance transparence

Sometimes I will write a line, a single line, several words and barriers, 
and they will seem sufficient, they will seem to resonate with the real, 
to dance in the mind of the reader or writer, sometimes that appears all 
that is necessary, as if philosophy is a foregone conclusion, need nothing 
more than the memory of a signifier of a catalyst, and this is one of 
those lines, those moments, opening up into places I cannot enter, places 
I have made for you and the fecundity of your detailing; I create my own 
barriers and thresholds, my own emissions and derailings, beyond which
nothing remains but fear, the slight scent perhaps of Anita Berber or 
Dogen, or just the masquerade of a scent, construed from the shadows in 
the corner, Carneades' snake or rope, history softly murmuring fact after 
fact after fact...

1. the expulsion from the real
neither A nor B
V opens from loving arms
you can't go back there
2. the ruptured huddle
not both A and B well I never
scrabbling for food
at least there's a chance of eating

3. entrance of the hungry ghost
not A you won't find anything here
somewhere else I really don't care
reality isn't where you find it
4 backing out of everything
you're stuck with flooded B
thirsted collapsed desert
mountain flood girl boy sutra

modeling, division by zero

when i was very young i lived in a world of division by zero. the result 
was infinity with n <> 0, but this was modified. 20/0 = 10/0 of course but 
we might write I (for infinity) so that I(20) is distinct from I(10). 
generalize: x/0 becomes I(x) and f(x)/0 becomes I(f(x)). what develops is 
a sense of process and history; I(f(x)) is dependent on the operations 
that lead up to it for any specific I(f(x)); it's as if 2 + 2 = 3 + 1, but 
the operations remain different and distinction; 4(2,2) may be considered 
distinction from 4(3,1). and this is true, providing the intercession of 
an operator is implied; 2 might for example be manageable and 3 not. the 
modes become more interesting when other f(x)/0 are involved or when 
thinking through (x/0)*(0/y) - the temptation is to produce x/y or even 
f(x)/f(y), canceling the 0, and within our mathesis, this may be reason- 
able. but again the 0 must be kept visible, historic; we might writer 
"(f(x)/f(y)) qua 0/0" or some such; it's evident that indices, both sub- 
and super-, quickly develop, become unmanageable. history piles on 
history, the mathematics leaves a necessary trace on the result - neces- 
sary because (x/0)*(0/y) is strictly I*0, which is up for grabs. the 
history imposes exactitude, facticity, where none is; it is a mathematics 
of sand-grains, not continua, of course related to infinitesimals, non- 
standard analysis, and so forth. but here, and when i was young, i valued 
these equations which told stories, stories that not only where inherent, 
but integral to their value in both senses of the word.

... i was in revolt, against mathesis, against those equations excluded, 
beyond the Pale, for no apparent reason, against the simultaneous weaken- 
ing and strengthening of zero, of nothing at all ...

( the shy zero, adding nothing to anything; the murder zero, multiplying 
and forgetting; the burgeoning zero, dividing into the production of the 
world; the generous zero, taking nothing away )

Real-time file access and organization -

Here is the problem, as anyone following my work can attest - there's too 
much of it. I'll be at the Openport festival in Chicago the end of the 
month, doing a symposium, talk, two performances. So I'm attempting to 
organize files for the last, and it's difficult. I narrowed the video/ 
audio work to 900 files - and these are edited from the mass of my video/ 
audio work in general, running I think around 2500. I've placed the files 
in two folders, Performance 1 / 2. The names (titles) of the files convey 
nothing. I'm still naming from the film years when one produced "pieces" 
with such. So there are 900 names, and I forget what most of these things 
are. It's not even easy to tell by extension - there are sound files for 
example ending as .mp4, and some of the .mov are set for no framework and 
loop; these are most often converted .mp4 in disguise. The problem with 
.mp4 in performance - the compression uses a lot of CPU cycles; the result 
is that it's actually more difficult to run a number of parallel .mp4 
files (which are quite small) than to run the same from the original very 
large .mov or .avi files.

Thumbnails won't do - they would be too difficult to manage, would clutter 
up the screen, wouldn't handle audio. I think of code - G for Geneva, D 
for dance, GG for Gruyere, GA for Aletsch glacier work - but then the 
individual pieces are still left behind. I've tried brief 2-3 word 
descriptions in the titles, but that doesn't seem to help; there are 
variations, some of the work is indescribable in terms of a few words, and 
so forth. In any case, the directories have to be on the screen when I'm 
performing - that's the whole point of it - the ability to choose video/ 
audio on the fly. I'm not sure where to take this - memorizing indices, 
mnemonics ... The total number of still images that I work with (i.e. not 
family) is about 10000. The total of everything is probably around 14000.

I swim in these. I need a directory structure for everything, coupled with 
a search engine; I need keywords and a way to delimit and present files 
during performance; I need a system which is easily understandable on the 
fly. I'm speaking of approximately 200 gigabytes of material here. I've 
been sitting going through file after file; it's a real impossibility! If 
the equipment holds up (I've been having difficulties with Quicktime 
retaining its preferences which are critical), things should run smoothly 
- they'll be more out of control than ever, the semantics of the perform- 
ance trying to keep up. But the presentation will, internally, be somewhat 
scattershot. I work with laser scan, motion capture, dancers, mappings and 
remappings of the human body, landscape, very low frequency and shortwave 
radio, filtered and unfiltered recordings of various musical instruments, 
images from the problematic of 'wilderness,' video and audio bounced and 
transformed across the country, material from Second Life performance, 
materials from programs like Netstumbler (tracking wireless), modified 
travel footage, local histories and architectures of early mass transit, 
sexuality, the 'edges' of languages, choreographies, interactivities, 
codework and codework software, Mathematica, and video/audio noise across 
the Net, offline as well. All of these areas are subsetted; they spread 
like tentacles across my workspace, (in)(co)herent, lost and found; now 
when I perform, I'm part audience, seeing the (re)presentation for the 
first time, trying more desperately than ever to hold everything together. 
This is a world of the forgotten, unorganized in relation to 'the clean 
and proper body,' inert to deconstruction (which is collapsed by error, 
circles of confusion, exhaustion, loss), open to Levinas' existence and 
existents. Never do I know where this has gone, will go. But I still need 
something of a system, something of a path through the dark woods. (And of 
course any suggestions greatly appreciated.)

Reel Histrionic


In Eloquent Gestures, The Transformation of Performance Style in the 
Griffith Biograph films, Roberta E. Pearson describes 'histrionic' and 
'verisimilar' codes of acting - a transformation from a melodramatic locus 
to incipient realism. She considers them in relation to 'analogical' and 
'digital' communication: "Though most gestural communication systems are 
unsegmented and analogic, the histrionic code, with its emphasis on the 
isolation of gesture, does resemble segmented, digital communications such 
as speech. Actors deliberately struck attitudes, holding each gesture and 
abstracting it from the flow of motion until the audience had 'read it.'" 
[...] "Not only were aspiring actors told to 'rest long enough in a 
gesture,' they were urged to avoid excessive movement, which might detract 
from attitude-striking." [...] "The elimination of the small gestures 
brings about the physical equivalent of silence between the grand, posed 
gestures, resulting in the 'discrete, discontinuous elements and gaps' of 
digital communication." In contrast, the analogical references the uncoded 
real, motions and emotions of daily life.

The digital is catastrophic, fold-catastrophic; it consists of jumps 
between gestures or stances, between emotions and their concretion as 
attitude. The histrionic is dependent upon the diegetic - it as acted 
action of the unfolding interpreted world. The histrionic is therefore 
always stylized and responsive, within and up to thresholding. A threshold 
is constituted by an increased differentiation between gesture and the 
diegetic real; this itself is stylized. In other words, there are two 
levels of code, stylization at work: the semantic contents of individuated 
gestures, and the syntactic divisions between them. The gestures are 
individuated (not individual); as with other linguistic formation, they 
are constituted by difference, differance, the playing among gestures 
'down the line of the unfolding of the diegetic.' So histrionic gestures 
bridge from one moment to another in the form <------<----<----- - they 
are held positions until anomaly (threshold) defers them.

Gestures are concretions operating within time's arrow, objectifying the 
body in a sequence of irreversible positions. The body constitutes the 
proffering of desire - it is held for the viewer, much as the display of 
the (sexualized) body operated in some elements of Weimar dance/cabaret 
culture. This holding is reminiscent of the still pornographic image, 
which is presented to the (mostly male) viewer; the viewer is aware that 
the histrionic is there for his or her pleasure. In the pornographic 
photograph, the erogenous zones function as 'strange attractors'; the 
diegetic is constructed by the viewer who creates a narratology resulting 
in masturbation, the cessation of (that) pleasure. The zones, however, are 
grounded in the analogical, the abject; the viewer is without the gesture 
of the histrionic (in both silent film and pornography).

Stylized gestures reference a repertoire, of course; they must be under- 
stood by both the actor (in re/presentation) and viewer (as indexical 
within the diegetic). And repertoires are always stylized, enumerations of 
entities that play, one way or another, within specified cultural milieus. 
In this sense, all repertoires are accumulations of conventions and genre; 
in the case of the histrionic, they are a rough set of mappings into (and 
constituting) the diegesis, in order that the photoplay 'move forward' for 
both actor and spectator. (This moving is literally self-centered within 
the pornographic, which plays within the (transitive and transitional) 
body of the viewer in both (interrelated) psychoanalytical and biophysical 
registers.)

(But pornography as well as photoplay is never fully reductive; defuge 
creates another deferral, from image to image, film to film. This is what 
might be considered the 'repressed of the analogical,' the referencing of 
the clean and proper body and life-story in relation to the messiness and 
decathection of everyday life. The analogical is always excessive and 
irreducible; digital mappings are mappings from one-to-many, mappings into 
the analogical (body and) real. Digital mappings are not only stylized; 
they are undergoing continuous transformations, splittings, decathecting, 
disinvestment, as the surplus of the analog has moved elsewhere. What 
constitutes pornography or photoplay, fashion or convention, at one 
synchronic instant, is constituted elsewhere at the next. The repression 
constructed by the diegesis itself (which leaves out so many things in the 
world) returns in so many different forms which become increasingly 
mutually unreadable.)

"The name _sensuality_ seems to be taken from the sensual movement, of 
which Augustine speaks, just as the name of a power is taken from its act, 
for instance, sight from seeing. Now the sensual movement is an appetite 
following sensible apprehension. For the act of the apprehensive power is 
not so properly called a movement as the act of appetite; since the 
operation of the apprehensive power is completed in the very fact that the 
thing apprehended is in the one that apprehends, while the operation of 
the appetitive power is completed in the fact that he who desires is borne 
towards the desirable thing. Hence it is that the operation of the appre- 
hensive power is likened to rest; whereas the operation of the appetitive 
power is rather likened to movement. Therefore by sensual movement we 
understand the operation of the appetitive power. Thus, sensuality is the 
name of the sensitive appetitive." (From Aquinas, Summa Theologica, trans- 
lated by Anton C. Pegis, Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas, Modern 
Library, 1948.)

SL, Silent fiLm, my softest repertoire


(modified from a response on Poetics)


Think of island-hopping, travel, between one and another place, from 
moment to moment; think of islands as digital markers, the journey as 
analogic?

Think of Second Life, where gesture is pre-programmed; where one can 
construct both gait and flight, but the rest is already protocol. You can 
add or transform gesture; as lived reality, they become tacit, ingrained. 
And Second Life is so pure, so clean; one can always get away to the 
unlittered bottom of the ocean uncannily devoid of life. Sooner or later 
virtual ecosystems will be constructed.

And in Second Life, gesture is part and parcel of repertoire; one behaves 
always within limits; there are barriers to travel, to height, to the 
planiverse itself. Everything transforms into style; labor is external, 
extra-curricular, just as this computer I am using was produced elsewhere 
and elsewhen - more environmental depredation, more human despair, greater 
and greater gaps between economic classes.

+++

I will move to Second Life; I don't get response in First Life anyway. I 
will live anonymously in the maternal folds of continuous production. I 
will take a new identity. I don't have a community in First Life. I'll 
have a community in Second Life. I'll be different in Second Life, I'll 
change personality, I'll be kinder, in fact, sharing software with anyone, 
murmuring beautiful conversations, flying to unknown places, engaging in 
literally inconceivable culture, sex, physical prowess, building schemes, 
economies both real and virtual. I'll forget the difference between real 
and virtual. I won't be noise as I am on these email lists for example or 
blogs for example. I'll be someone who words carry performance, whose 
words proffer beauty and communication. I will forget the power grid, 
electric commons engaging all of us in whatever worlds we dream, inhabit, 
construct, destroy. My gestures will be my manacles. My gestures will be 
genre; with any luck, will be canonic. I will speak to myself and speak to 
you from the softest of stages. I will be animal in Second Life.

=== http://www.asondheim.org/tabswish92.mp3

Using the model of silent film performance, the digital is not only the
series of islands, but the performance of the journey itself. The analogic
is the abject which cannot be contained, curtailed, the shores of the
islands, their sad susceptibility to global warming.

At this point, and it's my depression speaking, I can't help but fore-
ground everything cultural against the ravaging of the planet, the slaughter
of human and wild animal populations, the furious violence of our
government, governments everywhere. The silent films seem innocent but speak
otherwise of innocence; the seeds of destruction are already there.

Islands have moved to Second Life, and everyone and everything is buying an
island - universities, security agencies, art groups, cultural insti-
tutions of all sorts. It's this I'm thinking about at the moment, because
performance and gesture in SL parallels silent film in terms of phenom-
enology and histrionic. Sound in SL seems third-person, an add-on; later, it
will become more integrated of course, and the use of prosthetics will
eliminate the need for pre-programmed gestures - first-life and second- life
will appear equally analogic, equally 'smooth.' On one hand the rest of the
world (what passes past for the real) will seem distant and somehow safer;
on the other, the rest of the world, left to its own devices, will continue
the killing beyond any reason or proportion. We are living in massacre;
repertoire is symptom. What is the poetics of the dead poached elephant,
with its face cut off, whose photograph appears in the current National
Geographic? What is the poetics?



Qbico 56 LP review

Review @ http://www.volcanictongue.com/

Alan Sondheim
56
Qbico #56
LP
12.99

Poet, metalinguist, cultural theorist and musician Alan Sondheim is 
best-loved by consumers of sub-underground fare for the stellar sides he 
recorded for ESP-Disk in the late-60s. But prior to that he was already 
active as an improviser in Rhode Island working with Ritual All 770, a 
multi-disciplinary group that combined brass, vocals, tranced hand 
percussion, bass and drums with a great up-ending attitude to avant garde 
sources that was reminiscent of the way that the Los Angeles Free Music 
Society would later use a goofy strategy of provocative art prank as a 
cover to allow non-initiates to work on serious formal breakthroughs. The 
Songs - an early collaboration between the two - was originally issued on 
Riverboat Records in 1967 and has remained fairly unknown outside of All 
770's appearance on the legendary Nurse With Wound list that appeared in 
copies of that group's first album, Chance Meeting On A Dissecting Table 
Of A Sewing Machine And An Umbrella. 56 represents his first new LP in 35 
years. Here Sondheim is solo, using guitar, alpine zither, electronics and 
field recordings. The guitar material orbits a bunch of singular 
hemispheres that would seem to locate the arc of his melodic thought 
somewhere between the odd, baroque constructions of Sandy Bull and the 
knotty dissonance of John Fahey - or even at points Derek Bailey - while 
the electronics and field recordings are full of subtle concentric rings 
of melodic suggestion and feel almost like close-ups on organic events, 
full of refracted slow-motion pulses and coronas of phantom tone. The 
whole set is perfectly assembled, with tracks short enough not to be too 
gruelling and long enough to reveal their full transportational 
properties. Indeed, I'd go so far as to say it was Sondheim's most 
accomplished work to date. A classic of avant extension and highly 
recommended.

In response to the singing of death, repertoire, life-in-death, digital

Death doesn't become a song; the song is prior to death. The threshold 
which lays poetics to rest perhaps, something Auschwitz clearly didn't do, 
is that - at least for me - of everything we might hold dear - that is, 
the wild, the compassionate, survival with grace. It's hard to visualize 
the catastrophe around the corner, when we associate catastrophe literally 
with sudden transformation, war, trauma - not this slow rise of tempera- 
ture, or the picking off of animals one by one. We react as if it were 
another turn or fear of the apocalypse, i.e. 'we've heard it all before' - 
as if this means it's not there now, we're in a permanent state of crying 
wolf. But animals literally on their last legs have heard it as well, time 
and time again, and still it comes. I'm at a loss for the poetics here, 
just as in I think Parmenides, Socrates was at a loss when muck, mud, was 
brought to the foreground in the discussion of ideal forms.

Within the digital, within the idealized digital, there is no in-between - 
either here/there, or 0/1, or whateverx/whatevery - the rest of the world 
is held at bay behind the walls of a potential well sufficient to permit 
communication in the small - i.e. to permit communication. One might say:

within the liminal, the digital doesn't exist -
the analogic exists only within the liminal.

Aphoristic, but accurate, perhaps nothing more needs to be said, or what
else might be said might be of or within an/other register.

Jennifer writes this; she adds nothing to my security. She is thinking
about space and about tragedy.
She decides that length has no absolute meaning in kyberspace.
That leaves topology. She decides there are bendings and gatherings and
loosenings and disappearances but pretty much multiply-connected graphs.
She says people don't realize how _exact_ everything is here, because
their emotions are in turmoil. 
She says the _exactness_ is critical, turning everyday life inside-out or
upside-down.
Tragedy is always a flaw that floods and flows, and there's usually a
deed, she reassured herself. She'd read Aristotle and beyond.
She was writing this in an editor, knowing the system clock was just a
keystroke or two away. That the time would always be there for her. 
Then there were the programs, email, voices coming in out of the dark.
She felt like a spy who came in from the cold, because the cold was exact. 
She looked at her hand for a long time. She looked again and again.

Breakthrough - (Foofwa, please note)


motion capture filed performance in Second Life

(this is kludged to the highest degree)

I must admit for a change I'm quite happy with the results here. They're 
difficult to capture outside of the space, but the videos will give you an 
idea. Foofwa, there the potential of the Octopus here. Maud, you don't 
know what you're missing. 

http://www.asondheim.org/floater.mov

This just gets it started. Could the avatar push out infinitely into the 
unruptured catastrophic space of the edges of Second Life? Furious flight 
slammed against members-only barriers. The raw deal of equally infinite 
speed. 

the following was earlier, resonant

Howtodisappear



The disappearance of the branch into hardened rock and occasional 
artifacts. The root of the avatar is elsewhere; the avatar itself, the 
image-avatar, is ghost. The ghost travels through anything of course; it's 
nothing more than coordinates. Howtodisappear.mov, however primitive, is 
the beginning of transparency, wizard listening-posts on MOOs for example.
Here we are, the virtual becoming-virtual still.

=========================

Break/dance (new video/audio/image work) (in case you've missed this)

Given that the danced-to-infinity motion-capture second=life quasi-avatar 
is tethered at a root somewhat distanced from the object-image itself, it 
seemed that it might be possible to have the image 'break through' private 
barriers - of course with little consequence (so far); in any case you can 
see the result in the first two (small file) urls below:

Text from 2 Chicago Openport Performances


this is a placemarker for font and size
i learn nothing from my work. my work learns from me.
this is so stupid. this is so stupid. ehllo hello. nathan - 
somewhere near the begimning of 'the silent film era'
actresses were accompanied by orchestras or musicians
of their choosing to get into the mood of the otherwise silent 
so this is how it's going to be. what i do (here) is try to type,
well at one point someone told me I couldn't type (I'm showing you now 
heheh! - anyway I try and TYPE something until you're bored or someonne 
pulls me out of here (I mean Chicago, not Links Hall) - anyway so I try 
to entertain you - wait, please there's more coming...
this part was videotaped at Rilke's Grave in Raran, SW 
we're reading - well, Foofwa d'Imobilite and Maud Liardon - are -
reading the tombstone - and well, I"m playing the organ, that's 
somewhere else in the alps -
the sooner a train comes along the sooner I'm saved here. i'd better 
explain this
this is a model of a dancer moving through motion capture equipment 
that has some broken sensors sending the signals out to infinity where 
they collapse, grief stricken, and return, something like the rturn of 
the repressed. Now here is the return of the repressed, just a second 
here -
ok, it's more or less below freezing out there in the Gruyere
ok, this isn't getting anywhere yet. i'mm not a particularly good 
performance artist. I'm cheating, I recorded this stuff beforehand -
look around you - there aren't any naked people in the room at the 
moment, nor a waterfall for that matter... this is a deconstruction of 
a gun and on the left is someone dancing more or less and disappearing 
into the light. 
<thinking of content... war, viollence, stupidity, let's all kill 
President Bush! - ok, I knw you'rethinking, this is "illeagal," but 
what if we do this together?" -> yeah, well, ok, this will happen. 
let's back up.
we won't kill bush, we'll just wound him -
so - just in case you wondered, the hum you're hearing isn't from my 
laptop, it's in the system here in Links Hall and in fact I tend to 
love it -on the left is my avatar disappearing in Second Life because I 
programmed it to get away with it so it can go through cliffs and stuff.
now yhou're hearing the hum of the planet, literally - this is very low 
frequency radio stuff coming through - the antennas are modified by the 
performers - transforming the sound - Maud Liardon atthe end of a 
particularly exhausting day. 
maud machine - there's a file here called rottate i'll try to find it 
hold on the machine aspect is clearer
by the way: the title of this is "The Difference Between the Analog and 
the Binary Mode of Relating Real-Time bodies to the world" -
this was shortened from the title "My Partner is My Buddha"
this is literally the Maud Machine - why literrally?
this is Azure generating very low frequency coupling with an antenna 
somewhere in Orange County California
these are dead avatars
this is another dead avatar.
ok what you're hearing is an imitation of a 78 record created from an 
event in very low frequency radio stuff. 
this is really stupid.l i'll whos you what i feel like.
ok that's an assassin bug on the right. now we're looking at the 
wilderness.
when we work and we always do and we work together sometimes and we 
don't we try to harnass
we try to harness the digital and return it to the real world.
there of course is still a real world, don't believe the theorists.
where is it? it's among the polar bears who are starving and have 
turned cannibal
it's among the elephans which have taken to raping as a result of 
population pressure.
it among the fifty thousand birds that died at the world trade center 
site as a result of the fucked up pillars of light which messed up 
migration routes - as a result they died of exhaustion
this is the deconstruction of a tree, a real tree, with a ditial 
scanner. 
I'm not sure why this is important, but possibly in anotehr fifty years 
or so we might not have trees.
well we won't have "we" either
this is my sad ronin in second life -
when I work in second life i go to thebottom of the ocean
then i don't have to deal with cleverness and messy building 
and people flying by.
i can just do something maybe there
Cris Cheek should know where this sound is from, the only thing I 
didn't do here, the rest for whatever is mine.
this was done after abu gharayb. those blades are from a wind farm in 
West Virgina. think aboutg wind farms - like the beams of lightfrom the 
world trade center, most of these have been responsible for the deaths 
of tens of thousands of birds. they fly into it.
the avatar was takenpart and taken apart and taken apart
this is Azure Carter being scanned while moving - this results in the 
disappearance of Azure Carter, any trace of her, in the digital realm. 
I'd show this to you if I could remember where it is!
ok, this is the result of that maneuver more or less, you can see the 
body sliced -
we're back trying to suture things back together from digital to analog.
if someone can tell me when twenty-five minutes or so are gone I can 
wrap this up.
at the moment I'm thinking: abjection/politics
on the left, avatars imitating real-life people
on the right, real-life people imitatin avatars.
notice the people (on the right) we refer to as "The Bobsie Twins"
What coordination!
This took years to perfect
i used to do these things with the idea of a 'moral" or content or 
"content" or a "sememe " or something behind what you're seeing on the 
screen. 
then it occurred to me
there's nothing we can do at this point to save - well, our own selves, 
species from extinction, inundations, the stupidies - that's stupdi, 
stupidities of fascist presidents - so we might as well just play and 
make faces in restaurants
because maybe all we can do is dance
oh that's so stupid again
but it's true!
and it's true I can't dance!
so ...
so it's true that'
that there's a letter maybe beneath this one going somewhere 
my partner exploding with the motion capture equipment going into 
gunfire -
well I want you to believe this is gunfire
while a vacuum tube is deconstruct simultaneously
well I'd like you to believe it's deconstructed.
what's stupid here is I have only one screen and I want to have 
equipment on the floro!
floor!
more and more equipment, something I can disappear into!
I'll have to settle for
for some sort of entertainment
i want to thank everyone here for allowing us to present!
and Foofwa d'Imobilite and Maud Liardon for their brillians
And Azure Carter for her support and brilliance
And President bush for making this possible
and the Swiss Government for funding this in part
and the Alps for just being there.
thank you.

anguish disappears when our world suffers the most
an image weeps. an image does not suffer.
no, an image suffers the most. 
dear buddha, i will suffer for you.
thank you, alan sondheim.
nothing is real anymore, is it? is what? is nothing?
i am your electric-onic
i am your electronic buzz bomb 
i will kill all of you fuckers. i will kill everyone. don't forget - 
when you leave here tonight YOU WILL BE DEAD (honest, I really mean 
this more than I mean anything in the world) - signed, Mr. Bush. Let us 
[...]
If I can't be Buddha I will kill myself.
Then after I kill myself I will kill you.
Today I thought about the French Empire and the American Empire.
The end.
Alan Sondheim.
ok if you have any questions.
Ok I have a question. What is that stuff moving about.
"Well, I'm glad you asked that,' Susan said. This is really something, 
isn't it? (Susan didn't say that.) Well, what this , well, these are 
avatars torn apart, By What you May AsK?
maBY by Abu Gharab, he replied lightly.
Christ, he thought (although he didn't believe in God). There are too 
many things going on here. That zither is being sent around the usa 
coming back to me. That woman is Maud Liardon danceworking performing 
in a grange in the Gruyere. We need a cat. 
So you think this is funny? I will KILL YOU. This is NOT FUNNY. 
StOPPP IT
VLF radio runs around the world. The USA will use VLF radio antennas 
to: 
1. Disorient and kill whales.
2. Disorient and kill dolphins.
3. Communicate just where and when the BIG ONE will be dropped.
I'm a dope!
Just now, a reveleation: 
EVERYONE IS TWITCHING ON THE SCREN
Suddenly he realized: There were people behind himn.
It wasn't paranoia. He was being watched.
Something had to be done, something drastic. Then he remembered:

"He would kill them all."
This is the compassion the Buddha speaks of so eloquently.
Now we're hanging around the Aletsch glacier. 
I want to thank the Swiss government for making this possible:
a. Holding on to the Aletsch glacier in this period of global warming.
b. Giving my partner and I some money so we can eat again.
c. Making us stop worrying if we con't have any money for b.
I did this thing last night with different videos. And there I was 
thinking, there's just nothing you can do about the world, is there/
so it's not enoght to dance, fuck dance, it's got to be something else.
if we could only just kill ourselves. then everything would be allright 
in the worldl
but of cours we're just kidding, nothing like this can happen.
the whole history of the West: we're just kidding ourselves. (Honest.)
don't cry for us argentina.

for your eyes only
for the connoisseur of erotica, http://www.asondheim.org/exhibit.mov ,
and who is the voyeur here, who performs, who watches, who freezes frames, 
shuddering with delight at the 'classical' presentation of forbidden 
pleasures. for your eyes only, two days.



my sister's murder

you murdered my sister but i can get you off
my sister can get you off
afterwards you got off the bus
you murdered my sister but i can put you off for a while
afterwards she put you off the bus
afterwards you were put off the scent of death
look my sister gave up the ghost
when she came for you you gave up
you took up far too much of her time
she took up sex to forget you
now you get take-out whenever you can
trying to forget you once took her out
that night she gave out a bit of advice
the car gave out when you fled the crime
she screamed get out but you didn't leave
she got out of your way when you came for her
you put her out with the garbage and other stuff
because she'd put out and you wouldn't take
yes for an answer





get attention, how are you getting on

get attention, get a lot of attention
swing it, get into the swing of it, get into full swing
give a look, give a stare, give a cold stare
give a dreadful stare, get offended
wrong person, wrong place, don't get me wrong
give a hard look at, give a long hard look at
get what one has coming, get on one's feet, on one's feet
give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
someone has to give her mouth-to-mouth
would you scoot over, would you make a little room for me
would you squeeze me in, nail, nail someone, get nailed
why don't you give yourself a little sniff of this perfume
get a kick out of, get a thrill, gives me a thrill
pleasure, get pleasure out of something
get a laugh, get the big laughs, have the last laugh on it
get something out of it, get a lot out of it,
applause, give a hand, give a big and
give someone the run-around, get a run-around
give a stretch, give a stretch and a yawn, give a yawn
get nothing out of it, condense a sentence
a glare, give someone a glare, give someone a hostile glare
get something down to it, you're not quite yourself today
what's come over you, what's gotten into you
getting nervous and excited, how are you getting on

without order

i tried to deal without order, to apply topology, surfaces, 
to the digital, construct for example a sphere:
within the sphere, curvature is uniform, there are no objects, 
no striations; now consider a torus:
within a certain angle, vision is blocked, the cylinder connects,
connects smoothly above and below, of genus one in placement
nearby genus zero:
but these inhering differences go no further, elasticity problematizes
order within any configuration as handles, holes, bridges slide,
everywhere, ignoring the metric, there is no metric, let's make one,
just for the moment, no, it's useless:
so that there's something uncanny about the sphere's interior, we move, 
near and far, we reflect upon ourselves, 
something luminous must there be, or we dream of such, luminosity,
ourselves written, large within our world:
without order, there's nothing, it's all unaccountable, can holes merge,
of course they can, can bridges slide in deep interiors, yes and yes,
nothing is here, sphere to torus, but something to nothing, nothing
to something, always just invisible, for how may one leap, from sphere,
to torus, torus, to sphere, how may one cross, erecting order ?



CREPUSCLE and WAREQUIEM, 2007


Alan Sondheim, Foofwa d'Imobilite, Azure Carter

at Millennium Film

66 East 4th Street
New York City

Saturday March 10th at 8:00

Telephone 212-673-0090 for more information.

"Since 1983 the amazingly prolific Alan Sondheim has appeared at Millenn- 
ium on a regular basis with substantial new works. This time the multi- 
talented media artist has come up with a highly erotic and controversial 
feature entitled CREPUSCLE (TWILIGHT) which stars the remarkable dancer, 
Foofwa d'Imobilite, along with Azure Carter and Alan Sondheim. The program 
will include several short pieces shot in Switzerland." (CREPUSCLE is a 
mutual production of the three of us. The program will most likely include 
one work, WAREQUIEM, shot in Second Life.) 

"CREPUSCLE (TWILIGHT) explores the exigencies of dance, eroticism, cultur- 
al constraint, and arousal; it was edited from over a dozen segments in 
Geneva. The work tenders the null-point of language, a point where words 
stutter, where the body takes over, stumbles, where cultural tropes are 
transformed and disappear. It's the deliberate recreation of repressed 
memories. It challenges the conventions of dance, turning dance inside- 
out, turning dance out. For the three of us, it's the culmination of an 
erotic element in our work that subtexts and disrupts the performative 
itself. CREPUSCLE rides the muscle of the body and jouissance, opening a 
territory which remains virtual, haunting." (A.S.)
