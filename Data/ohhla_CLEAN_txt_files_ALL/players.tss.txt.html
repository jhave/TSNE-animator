Always can't be players
Players
Always can't  be players

-Too $hort-

Players are the realest time to go
If you don't understand I'll let you know
Players are the people who just can't stand
Having one woman and just one man
Players are the ones who always see
Players are the ones that you always meet
Couldn't fall in love, even if you tried
Couldn't be devoted unless you lied
It's the players in the world to the west you play
Fresh young tenders every day
Breaking hearts every time your love is real
Players say love just ain't the deal
But the old and wise couldn't tell you why
Players just don't live happy lives
So all you fake wanna be's I hope you hear
Players always can't be players

-Digital Voice-

Do you wanna be a player
Players
Always can't be players
Mother Fucker
Do you wanna be a player
Players
Always can't be players

-Too $hort-

It's Saturday night, it's time to have fun
Parties all going and players come
Sometimes in 3's sometimes in 2's
Fresh ball point pens, ready to use
It all makes sense, maybe it doesn't
Players just always use that lutten
Give it up everyday when the players play
Just don't act snoty when the players say
What's your name and number let me get my pen
Do you have any sisters too and that's to Kim
Cuz I rap to Kim, and that's the truth
And right now I gotta go rap for you
Baby, like players speak
Baby right there is a stone cold freak
Trying to be a player, but she don't hear
Players always can't be players

-Digital Voice-

Do you wanna be a player
Players
Always can't be players
Mother Fucker
Do you wanna be a player
Players
Always can't be players

Players are the bored I hate to say
Nine out of ten don't know the play
Falling in, Falling out, does it ever last
Players are the world, they're just too fast
Your life is at best when you lose control
Taking love from the way you know you told
You could love so much, just give you time
Your nothing but a player don't say your mine
Cause the way I love, is not your type
Trying to get everything you can for life
Too bad you don't know what I think you should
Too much of a good thing ain't so good
Your nothing but a player, whatever you feel
You can't be loved cause your not real
But tricks in the city could solve right there
Players always can't be players

-Digital Voice-

Do you wanna be a player
Players
Always can't be players
Mother Fucker
Do you wanna be a player
Players
Always can't be players

It's not only the men, it's the females too
Come out the shop with the fresh hair-dews
Working that bottom like it's on top
Looking so good you just don't stop
The guys can't help but to come your way
So your giving out your number 3 times a day
Your a player, baby, the real McCoy
Last week I saw you with my homeboy
Now you wanna tell me, I'm the one
And all I wanna do is just have some fun
Cause a girl like you, I know your kind
Think you look too good cuz your so fine
You'll be 30 years old still playing games
Giving out fake numbers and more fake names
But you'll find out, it may take 2 years
Players always can't be players
