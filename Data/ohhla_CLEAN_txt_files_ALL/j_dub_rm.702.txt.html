[702]: (J-Dub):
Hmmm,(yeah) come on,(you know we had to do a remix)
Yeah (J-Dub)

I'm gonna keep it real (Dent)
How you make me feel
Boy you give me chills, baby (Noontime)
I'm gonna break it down
You just drive me wild
(Las Vegas represents)
Whenever you're around (702)

1 -     You know how I do
        And you know how I flow
        Can I get your name and number
        Cuz I like your steelo
        And I dig the way you move
        And the way you do your thing
        Baby you can bring it on
        You can swing it this way

[Brad Dacus]:
Babygirl take a trip with me
On an exotic fantasy
I know your man will be mad
If he knew I was the best you ever had
On vacation, conversation is cool
Let's take a swim in the pool
Begin the romance, slow dance
You know the circumstances
Whisper in your ear
Making advances, giving glances
Picture this on the canvas
Sipping on pina coladas
On the beach in the Bahamas
Away from all the drama

Repeat 1

2 -     You stay on my mind
        Think about you all the time
        Got to get to know you well
        If you kiss then I won't tell

Repeat 2

Kiss me, oh, hold me, I say squeeze me, oh  squeeze me, whoa
Kiss me, oh, hold me, I say squeeze me, whoa, kiss me

[Missy]:
(Ha ha, ha)
One two, uh check it, check it, check it out
Follow, follow me, many, many, many miles
One two, check it out
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme break it down
(Ha, ha, ha)
One two, check it out
Follow, follow me, many, many, many miles
(Ha, ha, ha)
One two break it down
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, break it down

This track is nasty like pornography
Work the mommy I like Joe but he sloppy, dag
Poppy got a brand new bag, for real
I taking 'Quel O'neil like shaq, shak
Ask Michael Jackson who bad
He says I am but the queen not drag, dag
I'm bad enough to let my pants sag
I be in 'Vegas where 702 be at
Check it out

[Brad Dacus]:
At sight it's visual
Could it be physical attraction
I hear you're diggin' my steelo so come show me some action
What'cha gon' do, 702
I guarantee you'll be loving me after I'm through
Apparently you know what I'll do
Get it, get it, let me hit it you don't stop
We won't stop till I'm finished
Babygirl it's your world
I'll be your friend like those diamonds and pearls

[702]:
Repeat 1 (w/ J-Dub ad-libs)

[J-Dub]:
Remix, Noontime
J-Dub, Dent, 26-20 crew
See we out

[702]:
Kiss me, oh, hold me,(hold me) I say squeeze me, oh  squeeze me, whoa
Kiss me, (stop) oh, hold me, I say squeeze me, (hold me yeah) whoa, Kiss me</pre>
