[Intro: King Tee]
To all my real niggaz in the house, check me out
Without a doubt, Aftermath!
Ha ha

[Verse 1: King Tee]
See, back in '93 when Eazy-E was alive
Gs hit the spot to show the world how to ride
But ever since he died, man, I felt shit
But this time to get these fruads delt wit
Y'all niggaz got shaked, mad cause y'all niggaz is fake
I'm sick of all them lies telling you take
Known damn where you frauds are made, or wanna be
You'se a prankster, made a little money turned gangster
You're feeling paranoia? - yeah loc, I got something for ya
It's real life, triffling niggaz all up on ya
Now, who you're scaring? - who you're daring little whinny?
With your played out locs and beanie
I'll knock you out, let me show you what this Westside is about
Fuck them whores, get money, get clout
But so many boast about this and that
And what they would do with that empty strap
Load your gun, that's if you even own one
You're throwing up signs where you from, never heard of you
Kill the murderers and _Bust Verses_ at your way
Cause King Tee has set tripping on the bay

[Chorus: King Tee]
Y'all fools got drama, talking out your brain for fame
It's to put the Bitch Made for shame
These fools throwing up westside, known that they never gangbang
Much less "F" around with the hood they claim

That's drama, talking out your brain for fame
It's to put the Bitch Made for shame
These fools yelling out westside, known that they never gangbang
Much less "F" around with the hood they claim

[Verse 2: King Tee]
Extra.. Extra, hear the whole scoop about your group
They faker than them birds with whoop, it ain't real
The ship might sail, but when the truth hits the light
Your punk ass probably can't fight
Telling all your gangster tales over your played out beats
Woofing like you're coming from the streets
But when I'm at your back with heat, there's no room for explaining
Stripped like a bitch for campaigning 
I'm aiming at these fools who didn't pay their dues like W.C.
Experience to rough and hard times like RUN D
The Triffling King Tee is back with the twelve gauge
I'm finna act a fool, niggaz felt the rampage 
Worldwide, with Pooh and Bobcat and Black Devin
I've ripped _Pay Back_ in eighty seven
Swear it ends, I bring the real gangster Bis' unconcealed
Your whole background will be revealed

[Chorus: King Tee w/ minor Variation]
Y'all fools got drama, talking out your brain for fame
It's to put the Bitch Made for shame
These fools yelling out westside, known that they never gangbang
Much less "F" around with the hood they claim

That's drama, talking out your brain for fame
It's to put the Bitch Made for shame
These fools throwing up westside, known that they never gangbang
Much less "F" around with the hood they claim

[Verse 3: King Tee]
They call me Big Balling, suckers can't fade King Tipsy
Alkaholic gypsy, murdering these sissies
Diss me, I'll find that ass up real crispy
Glock Nine, talking to you now, baby kiss me 
Caution, let me dress that ass for your coffin
Often, I bring it to these fools quite awesome
I ain't nothing to fuck around with
Cause baby, I'll leave you worthless like thirst
I came through to break it down for my coast
The land of the big dogs and the C-Locs
Ain't to be trusted, so raise on up 
Before your punk ass probably get stuck
You little bitch..

[Chorus: King Tee w/ major variations]
You got drama, talking out your brain for fame
It's to put the Bitch Made for shame
These fools yelling out westside, known that they never gangbang
Much less "F" around with the hood they claim

That's drama, talking out your brain for fame
It's to put the Bitch made for shame
These fools yelling out westside, known that they never gangbang
Much less "F" around with the hood they claim

That's drama, talking out your brain for fame
It's to put the Bitch Made for shame
These fools throwing up westside, known that they never gangbang
Much less "F" around with the hood they claim

That's drama, talking out your brain for fame
It's to put the Bitch Made for shame
These fools yelling out westside, known that they never gangbang
Much less "F" around with the hood they claim</pre>
