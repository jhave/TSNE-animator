[Christina Milian]
Says he wants you, he says he needs you
Its real talk, then why not make him wait for you
If he really wants you, if he really needs you
Really got to have you

Take your time and feel him out
When hes a good boy, I mean a really, really good boy
Why not let him lay with you
Thats when you give it to him good

Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back roll
Pop, pop, pop that thang
Imma show you how to make your man say, Oh

Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back roll
Pop, pop, pop that thang
Imma show you how to make your man say, Oh

Youre gettin bold, hes growin cold
Its just the symptoms of young love growin old
You think its done
Then youre thinkin of leavin, but give it time

Its late at night, hes comin home
Meet him at the door with nothin on
Take him by the hand, let him know whats on
If you understand me up and move

All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move (Ooh...hoo...hoo...)
All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you wanna do (Show her what you got,
dirty)

All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move (How to move it on)
All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you wanna do (Ooh...hoo...ooh...)

Dip it low, pick it up slow (Oh)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back roll
Pop, pop, pop that thang
Imma show you how to make your man say, Oh (Imma
show you how to make him)

Dip it low (Ooh), pick it up slow (How to make it)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back roll
(Said Imma show you how to make it)
Pop, pop, pop that thang
Imma show you how to make your man say, Oh

[Fabolous]
Yeah, uh
Yeah, uh
Baby girl, I want you to pop, pop, pop that thang
I might stop to shop and cop you things
You know I drop the top and hop that thang
Sometimes I stop my bop to pop my thing
You sure know how to make a man say, Oh
And how in the world can a man say, No
When you wind it up on a wall, wind it up like a doll
And you know Im Bacardi, lime it up till you fall
Haul it up till you fall
And have those other chicks throwin vomit up
When they cant find it up in the mall
Like most men I love to catch up with a model
But I aint used to movin slow like ketchup in a bottle
And the best things come to those who wait for it
But Imma be straight for before its too late for it
I want you to Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out and make me say, Oh

Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back roll
Pop, pop, pop that thang (Yeah)
Imma show you how to make your man say, Oh (Oh)

Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back roll
Pop, pop, pop that thang
Imma show you how to make your man say, Oh

Dip it low, pick it up slow (Oh)
Roll it all around, poke it out (Oh...), let your back roll
Pop, pop, pop that thang
Imma show you how to make your man say, Oh (Oh...)

Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back roll
Pop, pop, pop that thang
Imma show you how to make your man say, Oh</pre>
