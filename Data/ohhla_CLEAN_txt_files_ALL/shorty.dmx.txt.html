*BEEP* Thursday, June 28th, two, oh-two, A.M.
"I just called you and you said Domino's Pizza but,
 and you said you were on your way but there's just one problem,
 I'm all the way to fuckin Rochester, New York.  Wrong ho!"

[DMX]
Uhh, yo yo
Yo, not this shit again
Dog gon' be a dog, y'knahmean?  Motherfuckin dog!
Don't GET a dog, you can't take care of a dog
Gotta take care of the dog, y'know? Y'know?
Take it easy lady, y'know? Uh-huh
Give me a motherfuckin break - will ya?

Shorty was the bomb, brownskin honey with a little dough
Come to find out she was a little ho, but still yo
I pushed up, shorty had that ass like BLA-DOW
Had me schemin on how, I could get that now
Was like GIRLFRIEND (what?!) let me drop a bug in yo' ear
She was mine cause I told her what she wanted to hear
Was like yeah, she knew how it was goin down
She said page me, code zero, cause I know you get around
Didn't have a man but even if she did DEAD
Cause my game is tight like a stocking cap on a nigga's head
I said - we'll get up like nine or somethin
Don't act like, when I say that ass is mine I'm frontin
That night was right, she let me get that, hit that
Rip that, bounce it off the walls, flip that
But only, one thing went wrong, the rubber bust
But I didn't fuss cause dog, shorty was the bomb!

[Chorus: DMX *singing*]
Shortyyyy, UH!
We only did it for that niiiight
But maaan the pussy was good (uh-huh)
But shorty's fuckin up my liiife, fuckin up my life
Shortyyyy, UH!
We only did it for that niiiight (just one motherfuckin night man!)
But maaan the pussy was good
(was gooder than a motherfucker, I ain't gon' front)
But shorty's fuckin up my liiife (uh-huh)
C'mon ma, give me a break

[DMX]
A few days later, I hit her up, just to keep it real (aight)
Was like - whassup Boo, how you been, how you feel? (aight)
She said - aight, but my friend's kinda late
Today's the 13th, and it shoulda been here on the 8th
I'm like - f'real?!  Don't stress it, it'll come
It better, cause I can't afford another, little one
She said - neither can I, I said - cool
cause I got mad shit to do and you still goin to school
So at least we had the same thing in mind (uh-huh)
Not to have this kid and, everything would be fine, BUT, I was blind
to the fact that she was settin me up, for the kill (c'mon)
Damn, why wasn't she, on the pill?
And I still, would check on her like, once a week
Sometimes I hit it, sometimes I didn't, but shorty was a freak
And whenever I would speak on the baby
Shorty would be like - I ain't havin this kid, is you crazy?

[Chorus: DMX *singing*]
But shortyyyy, UH!
We only did it for that niiiight
(man listen man, one motherfuckin night)
But maaan the pussy was good
(I ain't gon' front, pussy was good as a motherfucker)
But shorty's fuckin up my liiife
(Oh MAN this bitch is a fuckin HEADACHE!) fuckin up my life
Shortyyyy, UH! (Shorty was definitely a bomb dog)
We only did it for that niiiight
(One motherfuckin night, AND I was drunk)
But maaan the pussy was good
(The pussy, MAN! Let me tell you)
But shorty's fuckin up my liiife (Dog, this bitch is a problem)
C'mon ma, give me a break

[DMX]
By now, wasn't lookin too good
Cause she wasn't doin things that she told me she would
Like gettin the price checked out for what we had to do
And it goes up another yard for every month after two
and a half I had to laugh out of frustration (WHAT?!)
Now she's fo' months, I'm ready to hit the bus station (man)
If I was, still on that shit it woulda made me rob her
Told her friends - DMX? Yeah that's my baby's father (uh-oh)
Her lil' stomach is shown (uh-huh) so now the heat is on
Maybe she'll see the light, if I start to treat her wrong
Like if she thought that if she kept the baby she would keep me (what?)
So I played the game on her level, got sneaky (aight?!)
Let her have the kid, she said it was premature (uh-huh)
Found out, she was six months, when she said she was four (uh-huh)
So I left her with the pressure on the next man's arm
But she'll be aight, cause shorty was the bomb (f'real)

[Chorus: DMX *singing*]
But shortyyyy, UH! (was the bomb)
We only did it for that niiiight
(I mean what, one fuckin night? C'mon ma)
But maaan the pussy was good (man she sucked a mean dick)
But shorty's fuckin up my liiife
(Now this bitch won't stop callin, what the fuck man?)
Fuckin up my life
Shortyyyy, UH! (She was kinda cute though)
We only did it for that niiiight (All it takes is one night man, haha)
But maaan the pussy was good (mmm-mm-mmm!)
But shorty's fuckin up my liiife (This bitch, has got to go)
C'mon ma, give me a break</pre>
