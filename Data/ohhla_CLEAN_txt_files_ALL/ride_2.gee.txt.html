Verse One: Lil' Wayne

Head buster off top
Grab the chopper and chop
At the top is my spot
And nigger it's flip or get flopped
Let it drip or get dropped
I represent uptown
I 50 round on clowns I turn smiles into frowns
I from the place of places
I be the ace of aces
You can't beat the B.G.
I went the race of races
Solga box I lace it
Yo' spots in the world i takes it
Bulldog barrel I shakes it
Cashmoney boy paper chaser
Evil look in my eyes
Close shirts you die
Camofauge dark sky bi-bi-bye-bye you die
I make all rules in the game
I break all rims to blame
I swang benz with that thang
Ready to let my nuts hang
Nigga duck or ya' stuck
When the choppers releasin
Lettin' out them optimo demons screamin' red demon
From the uptown region and I'm here to represent it
Benz I'm spittin all black with a camafaluge ??
Seven gold darts street smart smarter than Eurkel
Let's go fist to fist knuckles turn purple when I work you
I ride a night rounds be tight 
I'll be light hotter than a candle, handle
Look, so shine the light
I just might catch you set so (Watch Out) 
you topped get chopped ya get wet so watch out
Um, me and you two for two what you gon' do 
You flex with two-two 
Watch a soldier shoot how you do
  
(Chourus)1x
Niggas goin' die tonight 
Heads goin' fly tonight 
When we ride tonight
  
Verse Two: Turk

Pimp niggas 
Fuck hoes
Split wigs if i have to be cool
Don't put a mask on ya' face just be yo' self
Try provin' ??? to yo niggas my get dealt
I got a click that's stronger that pneumonia bitch
Untamed Gorillas play wit' choppers ain't takin no shit
Don't underestimate nigga cause i'm young
Have you heard that age ain't nothin' but a num and nothin but a thang
So if you get banged that's all on u 
I spits more bullets than Bone Thugs speak to you
Leavin' blood stains in the middle of the streets
Stank niggas can't let them fuckin niggas sprankle me
Gank niggas i'm always labeled at the top rank nigger
I gotta chopper named Frank and it hate niggas
Stank niggas it gets the J-O-B done 
You better run cause when bust it's just like fun
Treat bitch niggas like a stepson
Unload reload bookah bookah the chopper come
The chest magaler
Neck strangeler
Uptown slanger
Brain untangeler, ya heard me
  
Verse Three: Bullet

Gotta uh chop with fifty shots 
Ready for combat
Fifty shots in my gak leave a bitch nigga wet
Flat wit a bars head what you know about that
A hot boy hittin' yo' set like a bad wreck
Wear a vest you could do that
I got some bullets comin' through that
Two clips take ?? full off highly tips
The glock nine automatic ? speed ??
I fuck wit' ballers and killers ask Suga Slim and B-3
Fresh ordered twenty keys turned them over to me
Hot Boys and i'm gonna put in that UPT
For shittie, get wit' me, og's falls for halves
A-T's kicked in the lab twenty G's worth of slabs
A-hundred G's and snaps two crazy AK's
My people got kayed so i'll be home in two days
Suga slim and Baby got the charges threw away
Gave the judge a half a minute told 'dem have a nice day
Suga slim and Baby got the charges threw away
Gave the judge a half a minute told 'dem have a nice day
Now i'm back street i'm doin the same ol' thang
A young nigga bout my change so i'm lettin my nuts hang
I run with ten ward niggas
Bout it all real niggas
In the steel for real nigga
  
(Chorus)
  
Verse Four: B.G.

I be quick wit choppers
Splittin heads for nothing
Big Tyme hustlaz flow short and frontin
I'm bout money and power
Nigga birds and bitches
Collecting riches and eliminating snitches bodies in ditches
??? keep a price it can't no better
You know you ain't never got a deal like this ever
Baby Gangster uptown representer
Cuttin' shit up chop you down off top you'll remember
I be spinnin the binnin 
No laughin no grinnin
Drop my nuts twerk it up bitch i'm all in in
I ain't cuttin no corner I come straight and direct
I'll put in a nigga chest you gotta give me respect
Fifty shots with an extra clip that's how i do
I gotta choosin menu and playa its all on u
Baby drop it to me on the DL
And I drop to all my niggas on VL
Put that coke in they life
Let them shine and floss 
Young boss get tossed 
If caught up in the cross
Hot Boys, fourteens and sixteens thuggin
Put the icin on the cake get caught up catch a sluggin, nigga
  
(Chorus to end)</pre>
