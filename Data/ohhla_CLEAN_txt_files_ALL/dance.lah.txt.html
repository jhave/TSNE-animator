Typed by: scott_rodkey@hotmail.com

It's a fact I'll attest to, mess around and I'll arrest you
I ain't playing, you know what I'm saying?
This ain't the best you've ever hear coming from a female MC
But you know what I mean? (Hail to the Queen!)
This MC stands for "Microphone Commando"
When I command that you take a hand
And throw it up in the air, yeah, just like that now
Chill, and watch me rap cause I'm flowing (Flowing)
Just like water I slaughter (Slaughter)
A battle, put me in it, I win it
The mission is music and rhythm
Rhythm backed by words, all in my system
System by techniques, techniques I got my heart in
Heart into the music, music I take part in
One try, one God, and one destiny
Just dance for me

	"Dance to the music"  (Repeat 2x)

Now understand that you must (dance) because this is a beat to clap to
My brother Lance said "Latifah you got to make them get up off their feet"
So I put my rhyme to a DJ Mark beat
Ample samples, this for example
Are made by the 45 King, so cancel
Your plans of moving to the front lines
He's a DJ, producer, and mind you a friend of mine
I hop, dip, and spend with the children
So get down with the sound and you will lend
To let me bring while I bring
Queen Latifah to the 45 King, creating
A new style in the name of the Flavor Unit
That's the way we like it, so I'm doing it
So if you want to know what the plan is to be
I order you to dance for me

	"Dance to the music"  (Repeat 2x)

My voice is your choice at a stage show
I do it for the Flavor Unit to make you say "ho"
With powerful lyrics I'm armed
To let a sucker step up and get bombed
By a beat created by my producer
To break you out of the stuff that you're used to
This here is a moment of truth
So take the record to the DJ booth
And let's start this, let the beat get dumb
Cause I'm a shake it all night and then some
People dancing, I can spot 'em
When I take control, you know I got 'em
Stop the music?  That's not a question
The Flavor Unit takes no suggestions
If you're not on the dance tip, here's your chance to be
I order you to dance for me

	"Dance to the music"  (Repeat 6x)</pre>
