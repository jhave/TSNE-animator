(talking)
Damn girl, (damn)

You got a tattoo right there (right there, that's a tatty, tatty)
I like that (ooh shit, a tatty, tatty)
Sexy than a motherfucker
Can I kiss that

[Twista] (Chorus - 2x)
Is it on your chest (uh huh)
Is it on your back (uh huh)
Is it on your leg (uh huh)
Is it by your cat (uh huh)
Show me where your tatty, tatty, tatty
Let me see your tattoo girl
Show me your tatty, tatty, tatty
Let me see your tattoo girl

[Liffy Stokes]
Hey there shorty, what you working with
Let me see you pop that shit for daddy
That's shining blowing big pound out a pro caddy pick up
Diamonds flick up protect your tip tattoo bezel that lift up
Blinding them booshy hoes
I bends through the Gucci store
Grinning, Sprewells spinning, but I'm standing still
Man trying to call up this zig-zotic hot mama out by the Ville then
I'm talking top flight, high priced brown sugar
With the curly butter, thick hips and all

With the E-V-E kitty cat paws, tatted above her bra
When the Twist sat down by her draws
With a bust that needs dusting off
Cause a man keeps on running off
Just dropping her cheese, but shorty got me's
Taking trips to the tat shop, come on the black top
Let her feel Anita while we smoke B's
Cause you really gotta get greed
Fish that pearl, and then show it off to the world
Thickness shorty got niggaz out here screaming
Let me see your tattoo girl

[Chorus]

[Bennie Franks]
It's Mr. Fat, freaky, black, nasty, damn near 4 hundred grams
It's something bout a red bone tattoo, god damn
You need a cover up, etch out your baby daddy name
Girl I know you love to fuck, just the way you took the pain
Check my name and etiquete, oops I don't mean to be rude
I got a fetish for oops I mean I love some tattoos
Let's get up on a room, everythang's on me
Ain't got no A in the ointment but I got some Vaseline
The brandy

[High Beam]
I said she suck me like a riiiiiiib
And then she suck me like a neckbone
I've been gone slap then I took the Milly that home
Since nobody needed to drive
I'ma be the one they gone put it on (put it on me daddy)
What's that, what's that
Another tat with the Playboy bunny by her cootie cat
Got one going in the crack of her ass
But she can't really see cause her booty fat
Girl you don't know what I'd do to that
Got little mo' scrapes right up on the crack
Put Legit Ballin all across your back, take that off and let me see that

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Can I see up your freaky body especially with a "Get It Wet" tat-too
If you ever think a tat' ain't sexy on a chick well homie I got news
We can see the top part of their booties out, blouses up
Girl lick her tittie even with a lil gut
Pull a cap off there's a tatty on her back
with a tail pointin down to the cunt
Illustration slick girls, thick girls
with the thongs on not really the ones that excite me
Stick ya wood in ya shouldn't but the one on her bossom says bite me
When I see the yellow girls it be over
Cherry by her naval, on her back, on her shoulder
Check out the girls with the neon ink
The glow in the dark ink and I don't know which one is colder
Had a bitch put my name on her chest, my name on her neck
My name by her custom tat, and the custom interior
have my name in the Vet'They beat my tat', see I'm laced
Spit a lil game, hope they take the bait
But don't let your tat' dry up, come let me rub a perferation H
A big butt freak with a butterfly ring on each butt cheek to cover her behind
When she pull her Prada pants down
I pop that thing and it look like the butterfly be flying
Look I be lyin, I put it on the B's that I pearl
Twista travel all over the world
It's such a damn hotties, with the tatty up bodies
Let me see your tattoo girl

[Chorus]

[Lenny Hooks]
Swig the cris and light the hydro'
Spotted a chick across the dance flo'Pimps like them tilt the kangol
Out the club she shotguns 6-0-0
Straight to the Mo' she came out, her clothes
She tattooed up like her a hell's angel
I'm searching around like I'm 5-0
I'm bout to put something on it this ain't no tattoo hoe</pre>
