Typed by: AZ Lyrics

What's up
Real nigga doin real stuff
Get a lot of money
You can never get enough
And you know the new shit sounds so tough
So-and-so just walked in, so what
I don't really vibe with a lot of these niggaz
I ain't really into givin more than one chance girl
I already tried with a lot of these niggaz
Fuck that
That team don't know real, what's that
That can't be from here
That can't be what they believe in
Is the best shit of the year
That's that fake shit, that's that fake shit
That's that top row of veneer
Just when they gettin impatient
Is when I make a world premiere
Ah damn, word, award show's comin
Make sure you spell the shit right
Make sure they give me all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff's still in that Sprite
They watch us, make this shit into a song
You ain't livin that boy
Stop stealin that life
Anything that happened when I do yah
I guess it all depends how I'm feelin that night
Okay, livin my life in hotels
Bitch better have my room right
If they kill me, bury me a legend
Bitch better have my tomb right
This is perfect for the women that I've loved before
I love em all
I just love you more

[Chorus]
I could bet all of the riches that I ever had
Rush in the night like a shock wave wouldn't be bad
If I had to ? cause of ? that run up my back
You must ?, nothing else can lead me off track

Hey, Yeah
You're like a wildfire
Got me risin high
Your innocence ?
Drowin in, would you save me
It's a crime if you don't
? by the throat

I could bet all the riches that I ever had
Rush into the night like a shockwave wouldn't be bad

Hey, Yeah
You're like a wildfire
Got me risin high
Your innocence ?
Drowin in, would you save me
It's a crime if you don't
? by the throat

[repeat chorus until end...]</pre>
