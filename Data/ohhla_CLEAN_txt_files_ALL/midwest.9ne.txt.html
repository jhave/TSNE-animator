Welcome to misery where the killers pop it up
whenever I say it and deal it at the turn of the gun
We can do it if anybody want it
where the rapper niggas will call up and tell everyone
Misery loves company so we done with thee
Enemy where he be energy sendin me the route
My negativity trippin wit me you runnin fo yo life
cause you ran your mouth MOUTH

[CHORUS]
We can sang or we can bang
It ain't no game we untamed
Whether its fame or we can aim
Release your brains it ain't no thang - MIDWEST CHOPPERS
know I sayin
We livin in pain
And it's a shame that you came and got drained
And listen mayn stay in your lane - MIDWEST CHOPPERS

Find it Murderers monolog come out of a sinister formidable place
I can let you kno the ins and the outs and I can spit it wickid
Twisted And you can see by the look of my face
Give me the mic and I'ma mangle it tangle it
Definitely people see that I got the hang of it
Pig you gotta try to make a mocery of a city, who
pock 'em pock 'em damn we dangerous
Came to get strange wit it bang wit it
Stop and get a little untamed wit it
Get the chopper like a fully bully wit a hoodie stop him take him out
So he can Spit cane wit it
Well the answer is right before your eyes
Who do you despies?
Killers who chop you we got to stop you
We gotta stop you pop you partner
Get up outta the way when techa nina be bustin
Gotta give it up I'm a veteran like I said so
I'ma light 'em up and get in your head again
Im better than ever
Never let 'em feather an
Hit the mic and get in again
Medicine ima
CHOPPA CHOPPA CHOPPA
Automatic kickin the ammunition
Killin the competition when it ain't nobody
HOTTA HOTTA HOTTA
Manage everything and everybody
You kno we never missin
Listen to me
How can I make you understand that I'm a general
Even if you poppin the competition in minimal
Cant see the killers and you can bet that we criminal
The thing inside of me keep telling me where to go
So I'ma keep reppin the mirror choppin freakin shows
And I'm about to be on top of this and truly be bustin
beggin for mercy you punk I ain't givin you NOTHING

[CHORUS]

We be the best We ain't talking about women we be talking about paper
Already made come and terrible
And the competition is the killa
With or with the buretta tight right under my sweater
And we hide it delopta be where my killas
But my dealers are betta
Like a blender leeroy like a guillotine
chop yo hands out and throw me out the window


Watch yo lyrical
Thru the atp
WHEN WE COME TO THE STREET WE DON POST ON THE BLOCK
For the killa I'ma lift my middle finger up to the cop
So On the way to the studio we be makin another hot track
They be lovin the way we spit it
Boy they want our position but they ain't never get it
In the hone of the pacific
We the definiton of a soldier
My opposition is the cultural
I spit like a tomic
Me and my killa are guerillas

Boy we tryin to battle cuz they want our position
But they ain't never get it
Man I told you
We the number one competitors dealin
Working the way to the top and get the millin
In the hone of the city you can never cross us

You can try to read us
You can try to beat us
Try to get your speed up but it ain't gon matter
Cause after were done bustin a nigga we don after
We takin after techa nina is the master

[CHORUS]

Whenever I'm reppin the city in the cane
Holla your brain cuz I'm a disaster
Dilemma get ready decibel comin atcha
We wanna Come atcha
Because I'm a style master  And I'm impressionable now
Just so ya kno now
I make 'em sweat
Cause the best with the flow
Whenever you wanna flex you can go
Keep stressing your code
And I make yo man go
Midwest will flow like
SHE'LL FLOW WITH MORE STRIFE
Cuz the energy is the bomb
I can tell that you fascinated by the way we rhyme
And we flow like with the mo like
Mo strike wit the fire
BABY I KNO U SAY IT OFF
Cuz so senemy enemys now
Irritate with the haters that be comin around so I kick it
Like a realla with the style
Im too set for a cure so and I don't need for a doctor to work
Late for makin yo nerves
Late cause he called ya
Hands down now I popped ya now
Lets take a trip to the back of your real gear
Strange the individual wit ill skill

TALK WIT IT
Let me act like you get tough wit it
When you get out of the truck spittin off the crane
Killers gon be the one to leavin yo bodies
Smoke ya but really
AND THE GAME IS DROP
Cause whenever I'm bustin its like
the full heart stopper
The techa nina get up the flow cause we
Midwest choppaz

[CHORUS]

You better Act right get right
Cause I'm the baddest nigga hookin up with the fastest badass
Hit you with the lyrical lyrical miracle whip incredible knock the head like a several
Diggy diggy down diggy down watcha diggy down
cook it clown and at the house hold it down diggy diggy_____ diggy down
And if you look for the sound you can be found
with the nigga in the crowd are you really wit me?
And when you hear it then nigga then zip it
These make you want to reposition and pivit
When we write it and spit it we makin somebody get it
And if they wont hear it then they wont get it, STOP
Oh we can keep babblin on
Or rapplin off at the mouth while we travelin
And we speakin on on the speakin on the things we be doin comin in to pop my mouth
And where the hell were u?
And I can stop with the drop
With the Caribou
And they see me pop I would say was you
And I wont hesitate to chop you
Until to you
While they doin you
And if you look at the better at the better to combust you got the Cali gun for fun
And if you throw me past the pack man you get it
They putting down the gun
CHOPPA yousa CHOPPA that techa ninaz a CHOOPA
We gon come and Knock your block off
You never see us comin hit yah run and walk off
Cause is more what we wantin
And we come in and headhuntin
Wont stop til we get to the top
It's the way we Midwest chop yah</pre>
