[Aesop Rock]
Sulking and bulking a half
Sulking a laugh crash test
Figure the mixtures digging up his last breath
Grief leaf thief briefly turned chieftain
The tap water is on the waters off the waters leaking

So this is blue
My frame reportedly spotted garden variety burners and lost to normalcy
My terms the memoir obligation in the boudoir crystallize impurities to zero 
on the autograph dirty catapult sponges my hunches hurling murder abundant lunches with the
City suppers punching (Hurdling!) tomorrow since 
I sit in consquence merging brings to
Bubble up along the edges of precious child fantasy broken, broken 
Hi, my name is Hazardous Tobacconist (Hi)
I'm hung on the brink 
I'm purgin dirt and spit my lung in the sink as for the
Product, well, it's drenched in a barren backward wasteland of shimmering moral tension
and venturing the plaza pleasant I saw it all from pixie dust to crepid pins and
Voodoo dolls and ninety dreams later the shooting gallery wall it's like not a wave crash
Similar to last or next heckle me not already doctored by regrets gray rain
Belligerent fragments bomb acid ushering the pixels till the image burned classic
Bliss in a barrel and motivation in a basket 
I'mma cast it out to sea and wait for my comma to grasp it 
I left my crutch over the rainbow with my riches and I know the rat
race of the bad taste once his grimace cringes an iron butterfly will float if given
Good condition but I'm still fishing the same worm 
from the same faulty position prosperity
I'm tryin to walk alone and miss the bliss inide the accidental meeting of the pencil
and the ceiling and the censures started meeting breathing at a rappid calibur at
Tat a line so gray will last forever more dusting off the dreams to be an autopilot
Still a silent understudy, funny how the opposite will throttle and the different
Stroke and model to the prison is innacurate portrayal 
of an adequate betrayal of a
Wish-gonna-wanna-coulda-shoulda-woulda did it isn't it amusing choosing and a plan of
Cybernating waiting till the mating means of motivation took a fine position dishing
only after every little kiddy has performed I just wanna be a general he said 
I just wanna, I just wanna be a general he said
I just wanna, I just wanna be a general he said
I just wanna, I just wanna be a general 
I just wanna sleep, yo, 
What a long capitol crust gallop my chariot burning and awful enigma sprung by the sling
of David appears gutter bug batch prior to hatch dismiss it as a soul condensing
Excuse to decorate maps with thumb tacks this gold star product pushing hate boogie
Themes enter the smoke screen blazing saddle remnants alive analyze pensive connect
All picket fences like chain gangs linked digging trenches to candy land image
Factory sold, ah, I wanna be an astronaut, I got the merits and heart and I bought a
starship with hard earned money from one hour selling dreams to dummies when they
Raise the lights Ja-ja-ja-Jesus christ I've never seen so many goblins in my life (Oh, my lord) 
Vibrate through the fog and then some dragging bent circuits on a short
Leash like organ grinder primates dancing for bread crumbs well did you touch that
Slugger banging on the table with an old tin cup thin luck I can raise the dead when
The shark settlers fled the place sprung out they bed of nails to spread the sails
Racing for milk and bread but I got big big plans I ride a big boat with a big ol'
Motor and I ain't really that big on helping you turn your leaf over (Let's sing) 
Bring out your dead a quarter pile sky high 
(Let's see) Run if your miserable saw the plant
Fly by my name is try to deny magnificent doom craft my ragged soul built and I'mma show
you why this fucking globe tilts

(Repeat 3x)
Take me where the air is clear 
I don't really know where but I know its not here and
every little step she takes makes me speak
cause I know I'll never have to sleep alone again</pre>
