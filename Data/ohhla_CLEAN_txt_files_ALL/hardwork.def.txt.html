[Chorus - 2X]
Hey this is dedicated to the hardworker
(Yeah dat)
Hey this is dedicated to the hardworker
(Yeah dat)

[Defari]
I walk with the black like Jesus
Every ounce of my blood be the reasons
that I live, for the heads that be knockin'
Everywhere I go, I get it poppin'
I hit with an intensity
That'll fracture your chest and bruise your kidney
I travel often, follow paths that pay me
Domestic international shows are crazy
One flag, one playlist
Full of .mp3's that get dragged
into Serato, the kush, a good bottle
The life of Defari a best selling novel
An apostle of hip-hop
Gospel, a promoter of throat and tonsils pretty girl
A double of Johnny Walker Green
I stay two things, in trouble and a king

[Chorus - 2X]
Hey this is dedicated to the hardworker
(Yeah dat)
Hey this is dedicated to the hardworker
(Yeah dat)

[Defari]
(Sss, ahh, this Hennessy)
I walk with the slaves like Moses
Every time I hit the stage fans know this - D's killer
I know you dope, you can freestyle forever
And that's dope that you have no catalog or cheddar
I wonder if they ever gonna realize I own this
Herut Music, shows be the bonuses
Feel like Shaquille, man I need more paper
I need more now and I need more later
Got a lock on my lane like the jaws of a gator
Overcome laws and flaws, I only get greater
When the pro's in your area I'm constantly shootin'
Like Floyd Mayweather, bink-bink man, he's movin'
And movin' and stickin' to the script like Bruce Lee
Gang of birds ask they boyfriends "Who's he?"
I'm like - Barry Bonds off that juice when I hit
Hip-hop is the shit and my foot's all in it

[Chorus - 2X]
Hey this is dedicated to the hardworker
(Yeah dat)
Hey this is dedicated to the hardworker
(Yeah dat)</pre>
