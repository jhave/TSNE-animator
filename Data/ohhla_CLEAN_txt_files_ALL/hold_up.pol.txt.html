[ VERSE 1: Masta Ace ]
Y'all rap cats is so bogus
That's why in the clutch all y'all choke like 'dro smokers
Just say the magic words like ho-pocus
And poof, your career is a blur like no focus
Y'all don't know me, but I ain't new
Got mad years in the game, but I ain't through
I could look a young kid in the mouth and rap like I live in the south
But the fact is - I ain't you
Look, it's just me here spittin some game
Hold up - did I just say 'spittin some game'?
Coulda rhymed that with 'in the drop gettin some brain'
Or try to make a claim like 'I'm shippin some caine'
But nah, I don't rap like a typical lame
Talkin 'bout how a chain got 'em dickin some dame
I'm such a fan of the game that I'm sick of the same
So I go back in the archives and listen to Kane
What

(A-a hold-a hold-up) --&gt; Rakim
(Ho-hold it right there) --&gt; Kool G Rap
(Because you might get shot) --&gt; Erick Sermon
(Ho-hold up)

[ VERSE 2: Sean Price ]
Yo, the pistol was chrome and the handle pearl grey
When I pop Kings I kill 'em, I'm James Earl Ray
Fuckin around, I ain't with the games girls play
I'm clutchin the pound, I know where your main girl stay
I'm rappin for real, you motherfuckers rappin for play
Packin the steel, actin like it's back in the day
Clappin a tray but actually ( ? ) with the caine
With a gun I get dumb like I'm back in the Bay
Listen, my vocab off the chain
Hold up - did I just say 'off the chain'?
Coulda said some other shit like 'I'm better than y'all'
Line 'em up, watch how fast my competitors fall
Niggas rap tough, but they fuckin sweater is small
Kinda funny like you work for Dave Letterman, paw
Listen, crackin jokes sell crack to folks
Roll it black, smoke it up till it scratch your throat
P

[ VERSE 3: Torae ]
Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
You should hold up cause you 'bout to witness some fly shit
My shit Sean and Ace allowed me to demonstrate
Styles buckwild, meanwhile yo ass I obliterate
Get it straight, the facts is right and exact
Do it for the love of the rap and the dubs on the 'Lac
Do it cause I'm lovin the fact you love what the spittin do
Brainiac dum-dums bust the scientifical
Nigga, it's just Tor here with two of the best
Hold up - did I just say 'two of the best'?
Coulda said 'the Double Barrel leave two in your chest'
Flamin your flesh, T'rae David Koresh
It's the off-beat on-beat man with the mostest
Y'all niggas sweet like the fillin in a hostess
This shit is heat, y'all can seal it in your holster
Brooklyn, we body the beat and then it's over</pre>
