[Intro: Troy Ave]
Aiyyo, they said it's 10 points higher up there
We got to go get that.. {La Musica de Harry Fraud}

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother 
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road (protect on this road)
From the rascal alf-alphabet boys
Trackin' choppers in the highway patrol (in the highway patrol)
It ain't right, but it's white and it's right
And I know once I get there that it's sold (ooh add it right - powder)
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road while I get this dough

[Pusha T]
One man cowboy, speed limit timid
Chevy Malibu; we graduated from them renteds
Lost 100 large on the last time we sent it
It's only four letters, I ain't worried 'bout a sentence (k-i-l-o)
Travelin' the distance, stayin' off the white line
Alphabet boys out prayin' what they might find
I hate the Carolinas, racial profiler
Say you smokin' marijuanas (lyin motherfuckers) - fuck you talkin 'bout
My piss is clearer than my mama's, with her church wig on
996 before I get my Big on
Thousand grams, thousand hands, thousand furs, thousand bands
Hundred thousand dollar horse all-star we stylin' in

[Chorus]

[Pusha T]
You niggas ain't takin' road trips for real (nah)
Route 13 with the vacuum seal
Pre-paid Legal on my window shield
The ice cream man's on his Jack &amp; Jill
Moving weight state to state; MACK trucks I deal
MACK trucks I fill; I feel better knowin' 
that the donor is anonymous; see, my diamond is growin'
Tugboat or car tow, we summertime snowin' (God)
Reasonable Doubt flowin' on your niggas
Been gettin' it since '96 in black AC Vigors
Snub .38 with the matte black trigger
When "How Can I Be Down" was filled with crack niggas
AHH!

[Chorus]

[Outro: excerpt from the TV show "The Wire"]
My name is my name! My name is my name!</pre>
