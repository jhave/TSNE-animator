[Verse One] [MURS]
I got my house shoes on and my white t-shirt
My basketball shorts, I'm about to get some Squirt
I brought my own cup with a little ice in it
Cause I might mix it up and get nice in a minute
They call me ghetto but I don't give a damn
Cause I'm standin' on the corner with my cup in my hand
Other hand down the front of my pants, scratchin' my balls
They sag a little bit so you might see my drawers
I'm on pause
Man, I'm in my chill mode
Just got paid and I got a little bill fold
I'm feelin' good man, you can't tell me nothin'
Then the homie Verbs roll up, yo what's up man?

[Verbs]
Nothin' homie with the spokes I'm on move
Tryin' to get some jerky and some coconut juice
Yeah
I just cranked a couple miles and the sweat is droppin' down
I was set around your town
To Supowida and Pico made a right by some hills
And now I'm at the store with MURS, we fienda chill
But now a nigga awfully thirsty, that's for reals
So Verbs spins till your thirst quencher on the grill
But I ain't got no skrill
But homie can you spot like we workin' on the bitches
Make sure you get some Optimos and Swishers
I'm about to go the distance with this eye
And by the way my nigga can you get a can of Sprite?

[Chorus] [MURS &amp; Verbs]
[M] What you want from the store man?
Let a nigga know
But hurry up fool cause I'm ready to go
[V] I want a Snicker bar and a Dentyne Ice
[M] Well if you kick your boy down with some ends that'd be nice
[V] What you want from the store man?

Let a nigga know
But you need to hurry up cause I'm ready to go
[M]I want some chips I want some drink
[V]What you think this is?
You better your ass up and come and roll with the kid

[Verse Two] [Verbs]
Let me tell you how this ish went down
Eatin' bags of chips and I'm in Mid-town
Meetin' pretty ass broads that I met in Santa Mon-
Ica, oh yeah and MURS 
And we ran out of the car
I have solutions
Let's walk to the store
She said it would be faster if we up and use my car
Aye aye aye aye, that would be a waste of gas and
These siddity girls actin' like they got classes
Two little group-ies
Actin' hella boushe
All they do is listen to Kid Cudi and Lupe
Hold up
I ain't even tryin' to clown but
What I'm tryin' to say is they from the other side of town

[MURS]
What's up man?
These chicks ain't never been to the hood?
They look a little shook like they think they too good
Like my neighborhood store ain't up to they standards
You can get a white tee or a new bandanna
A bag of Gummy Bears and some new tube socks
A pack of Trojan large and a fruit juice box
Some new 2Pac and some bootleg DVDs
Dominos, Doritos and some dirty magazines
What more do you need?
A nickel bag of weed?
My boy got them sacks but they got a couple seeds
And if that ain't good enough, you just ain't hood enough
Get your ass on before my home girls fuck you up

[Chorus] [MURS &amp; Verbs]

[V] What you want from the store man?
Let a nigga know
But you need to hurry up cause I'm ready to go
[M] I want some cupcakes 
[V] Bring me up somethin' fool
You still owe me from the last time that shit ain't cool
[M] What you want from the store man?
Let a nigga know
But you need to hurry up cause I'm ready to go
[V] I want an Arizona (What?!)
Homie, the mango kind
[M] That's cool but I'm gonna have to keep the change this time</pre>
