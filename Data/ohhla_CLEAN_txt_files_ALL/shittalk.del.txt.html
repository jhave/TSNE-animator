* "Pet Peeves" part two

Hey whassup man, this is D-E-L once again
I'm here to tell you a little story about this motherfucker 
who keep runnin his big ass mouth
You don't know me, motherfucker
Shut your ass up, 'fore I slap the lips off your motherfuckin face
Man, you got a big ass mouth!
You know what?

[Del]
Fools is hella talkative, saying how I walk and live
Always trying to start the kid, wishin that we all can give
a small interview, just a subterfuge
Wanna hook up with you so they can say 'whatchu do'
Get your own life, live your own legacy 
Why you wanna spread my rees, talking 'bout my girls pregnancy
Professor, I guess you never learned your lesson 
When you saw me out drinkin at the bar, 
you said I was sexin this other ho
Chuck D, what a brother know 
about my beeswax, runnin off with your feedback
Who I smoked weed with? Who I smoked crack with? (false)
How I sexed every girl you know without no prophylactic
Fool, I'll be in the house and that's it
On the rap tip or studyin, unlike you
You quite new, no game
I understand you a youngster, wanna be hustler
Undercover buster
Can't believe I trusted ya - but that goes to show
how fools fold getting jelly off the dough, yo!

[Del's imitation]
"Del's rich Del's bitch got zero, cause Del's a hero, 
 Del's a weirdo because he do heroin"

[Del]
Ain't got no idea where Teren's been
I should take it to pugilism so 
I can fuse your vision with some realness
Instead of these fake phony stories you be glorifyin
Don't you know that many more are dyin?
From the fatal disease, called runnin them choppers
in front of females, or on front of the coppers
You only do this shit cause you be wanting your propers
Somebody's gonna get steamed and run up and pop ya
You exercise your choppers really, choo choo choo
You exercise your choppers off some brand new news
Your molars bite, your canines tear, whether it's false or true
You exercise your choppers like some gossipin fool
You know what?
You get your little notices from bumpin your gums
When you should be concentratin on lumpin your sums
Got to show your little ass when company comes
Cause We From The Crew That You Wanna Be From
You get your little notices from bumpin your gums
When you should be concentratin on lumpin your sums
Got to show your little ass when company comes
Cause We From The Crew That You Wanna Be From!
