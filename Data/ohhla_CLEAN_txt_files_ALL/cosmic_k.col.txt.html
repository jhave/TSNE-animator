Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks no renovation
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that's flattering but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more
See my man Nate, ask me if I gain weight, I said nah
My pockets got fatter, that's all
Money was an issue but now that that's solved, I ball, I ball
Like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my man
And dog, my shows be off the handle
Take the proceeds, go to gamble, ha
Bet it all black, and pray I quadruple my salary
If I win maybe then I can pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealing with some real life shit
She be asking when, bitch, when I feel like it
Cole World, Cole life, Cole blooded
I be on my shit and look at all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club staring at me
How that feel? Very happy

Cole World, Boy, check the degree's
These lil niggas is trash go and get the Febreeze
That's why I blew up on you sucka's all that's left is debris
One soldier's all that's left is fatigues
Act like you know me boy, I'm Kobe
How the fuck you gon step in my league
Rapping bout bullshit, your message fatigue
Played out, phoney nigga probably only got arrested for weed
And out here talking that dime shit
Dom Perignon shit
Not gon cut it like some scissors on my lawn shit
Grown cause I own shit
This is what you won't get
Game so cold, bring the blizzard to the Palms
I'm a wizard, I'm a don and I put this on my mom
I'm offended, I'm appalled
If y'all ain't bowing
Claim you a monster but y'all ain't growling
Claim you a beast, why y'all ain't howling?
'Bout as sweet as a jumper on the gay Ray Allen
I'm 'bout fucking hoes like Ray J wylin'
Killin' niggas like K K K violence
I guess it's why they pay homage
Momma I'mma be BIG and I put that on the late great Wallace
Christopher, check my temperature, nigga my integers..
Whatever man..

Alone in my zone, tell me don't it sound stunning
Been fucked the world but she just now cummin'
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground runnin'
I ain't never been the one for fourth down puntin'
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I'm crown huntin'
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks
So I lock pick just to lock shit back
I want Money, Power, Respect since the Lox said that
Better stay up on your toes, this is not tic tac
Yet, I'm a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here
Ballin' like a Laker you should pray for next year
Cause I'm repeating and I'm 3-peatin'
And I'm knee deep in the game its quick sand and I keep leakin'
The label heat seekin', nigga ain't sign me, what the fuck was he thinkin'
They say I killed the game, that was only pre-season

I'm heavy
I'm Heavy

Man, I'm already hot, you can say I'm pre-heated
If money talks, mine telling your's "be seated"
Cut my leg off I wouldn't be defeated
Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it
Email the shit make sure you CC it
For these fuck niggas who don't wanna believe it
I be in the airport damn near bare foot
Security hollin' out, Cole we need it
Getting high as fuck and I don't even be weeded
No point drinkin' I can't even be faded
Real recognise real like they related
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated
Hatred is flattery I'm glad to be hated
Fuckin' bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just happy he made it
My money was running late now, now it's happy belated
I'm heavy, nigga I'm heavy</pre>
