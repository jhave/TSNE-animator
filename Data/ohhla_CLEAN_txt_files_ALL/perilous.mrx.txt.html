Verse 1

Face defeat when facing, the rawest that's alive
Faithfully I slay them and brought upon the tide
Breaking free from satan its like god is on my side
They been patiently awaiting for the marxman to arrive
The bomb is in the ride design to bring sure harm
I endure the storm this is I in pure form
This is not a test, rules are disregarded
A prophet in the flesh the movement has started
Step into the gauntlet, feel the soul burn
Veterans will forfeit there is no return
There is no excuse, lyrical abuse
If I drop another album I did that for my troops
Focus on the mission, schemin on the riches
Not a dream I'm gifted, fiends is in the district
My regime of misfits so obscene and vicious
Your team is on the hitlist marx I mean business

Chorus:

The name is marx
Tell em what I came for
Its hpr
Tell em what I came for
I face the odds
even when the rain pour
Tell em what I came for
I came to wage war 2x


Verse 2

Razor sharp state of the art the way of marx
Breaking hearts evading the sharks I play my part
The days are dark, the fleet is in position
Broadcasting live speaking for the resistance
Teach it to each infant the school of the gifted
True skills seperate the truth from the wicked
The lies from the message, the wise from the hectic
My cipher unaffected the style is authentic
Your signing a deathwish the craft is devilish
Outlast the flesh with this the tracks perilous
Masked terrorist tactics treacherous
I dare your regiments to travel the path weaponless
Half excorcist disturb the darkness
Deserve to forfeit dispersing words of carnage
Burnt offers Body of god
The art is filled with carbon copies and frauds
