[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I love the way you, put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful, all of the time, time, time
And girl that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind?
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day (today)
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day
No makeup today
And girl that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind-mind-mind-mind?

[Kendrick Lamar]
I know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
for you to put it on? It was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
From Heaven is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips, all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar] + (female)
I know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
for you to put it on? It was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
(Concentrating on the way my) eyeliner thickens
(He stand behind me and try to) figure her vision
(of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone
 My complexion in a direction) I've outgrown
(I feel like it's not enough
 I can never put on too much makeup
 Yeah I know) your imperfections (I be constantly stressing
 From him is where I get it from)
 They tell me I need to) smile (at least once in a while
 I hate my lips, my nose, my) eyebrows
(It's the beauty in me, but what he don't see
 is that I had a black eye) *beep*
To be continued, eleven

"Ladies and gentlemen"
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
