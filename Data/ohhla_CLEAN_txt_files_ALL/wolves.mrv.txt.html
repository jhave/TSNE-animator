[Messy Marv]
Awww yeah, yeah, yo
Young Mess struck the Mac and his lights went out
Then I knocked all the ice out his mouth
Check it out, one to the face, two to the neck
Hit the liquor sto', then went back to the 'jects
The fiends get credit, them hoes post up
The police patrol, feds take close ups
The block stay hot, it's work outside
Don't ride through stuntin, cause you niggaz might die
When the sun go down, them wolves come out
Say the wrong shit I put the heater in yo' mouth
Them boys sit on Tuesday, the money come fast
I'm on the block with like, 50-11 rocks in my ass, be cool

[Hook]
When the sun goes down, the wolves come out
The guns been outside, and we don't have droughts
The fiends get credit, them hoes post up
The police patrol, feds take close ups
When the sun goes down, the wolves come out
The guns been outside, and we don't have droughts
The fiends get credit, the hoes post up
The police patrol, feds take close ups

[San Quinn]
Night time is the right time to use that K
Two-two-threes ain't cool they abuse yo' face
I'm a stand up guy, I don't sit down
Killers don't talk, they break up crowds
Eleven to six, have yo' pumpkin covered
Your family won't love it when you turn up smothered
I give day away, on lay away
My shit so pure they can't stay away
Plates with the groove it be tearin your nose up
Blades so sharp they be tearin they toes up
Put ten on yo' helmet, Niner or Raider
Bronco or Charger, we will deflate ya

[Hook]

[Messy Marv]
Yeah, man fuck that Remi, bitch I'm on Gin
The O.G.'s say I'm on my way to the pen'
I don't give a fuck, its rocks in my low
The stones in my mouth keep my Metro froze
Fillmoe nigga, the belly of the beast
They love me out in Oakland from the Bottoms to the East

[San Quinn]
Some claim they thuggin, but they stay out clubbin
We outside waitin, got security duckin
Bullets fly past ya, hittin bystanders
Bout that gossip, you can die over slander
Jumpin out the Phantom, doors suicide
Gangsta's inside, and we don't coincide
