Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me, from me
Life's gotta always be messing with me
Can't it chill and let me be free
Can't I take away all this pain
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Freeling like a freak on a leash
Feeling like I have no release
How many times have I felt diseased
Nothing in my life is free, is free

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

You're such a bad girl, you can call me bad, girl
I'll break your spirit before you break mine
Girl you're so purdy, wanna get you dirty
Wanna get you naked, wanna make you mine
Freak on a leash, sex on the beach, girl I'll be all strung out
I'm high as a kite and I just might stop to turn you out
Cause when I'm a walking I strut my stuff
Why can't I get just one fuck
I guess it's got something to do with luck
I've waited my whole life for just one

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me</pre>
