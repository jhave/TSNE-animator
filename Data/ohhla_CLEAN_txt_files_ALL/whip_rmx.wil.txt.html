I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth

[Nicki]
I was on my way to school I do'z me
I hopped out the drop grabbed my juicy
I hopped, skipped and jumped past the hoopdies
But, wait I forgot to grab my loose leaf
I doubled right back b-back like who's that?
I did a little dance like cat boom boom cat
I love how the jocks be watchin me me
So I grab my crouch and say he he!
I be like bum diggety bum when I pop my gum
They lookin dumb diggety dumb
think they stopping something
I said excuse me honey
I'm b-bugs bunny
I'm bugs bunny
ain't got my carrots
you ain't got nothing for me
Cause we the mean girls y-yes we so fetch
And when we in the yard be jumping double dutch
We back to the future, pearl ya wit da best
(huh noise) hair, hair, hair

[Chorus]
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth (Just whip it)
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth (Whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth (Just whip it)
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth (Whip it real good)

I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth

[Willow]
Imma get more shine than a little bit
Soon as I hit the stage a-pplause I'm hearing it
Whether it's black stars, black cars, I'm feeling
but can't none of them whip it like I do
I...., I gets it in hmmmm yea I go hard
When they see me pull up I whip it real hard
I whip it real hard (whip it whip it)
real hard, I whip it real hard
(Whip it, Whip it real hard)

Don't let haters keep me off my grind
Keep my head up, I know I'll be fine
Keep fighting until I get there
am down and I feel like giving up

[Chorus]
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth (Just whip it)
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth (Whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth (Just whip it)
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth (Whip it real good)

I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
I whip my hair back and fourth
