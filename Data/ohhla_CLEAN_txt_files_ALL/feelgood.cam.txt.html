[Cam'ron]

Eh yo, why am I gonna sit here and let ya'll bug me
Cause I met a dime and the girl is lovely
And though we in love she ain't all luvy-duvy
Smacks me on the ass and says fast nigga fuck me
Don't worry if my babygirl trust me
I don't do nothing for her to bust me
I would love her if her rings were rusty
Feet were crusty
and arms were musty
Cause ain't nobody gettin that--just me
And ain't nobody hittin that--just me
If I cheat I know that she will bust me, crush me
Cause she know how many girls lust me
Back in the day they wouldn't even touch me
Now they say they don't want nobody but me
To tell the truth
Them girls just disgust me
Cause I already found the one that love me

Chorus
[Usher]

It's all good
Lovin somebody 
As long as somebody loves you back
2x's

[Cam'ron]

Mess with her?
I ain't have to
But player I was glad to
Brownskin dove
But her love won't pass you
Promised her a ring
Along with a shine
Never stressin my rhyme
All she wanted is time
Where she find me at
Cause I'm a grimy cat
Puffin dime sacks to see where my mind be at
And you know the game a nigga got, I told her yo
I don't always have to hit the twat, ust to get you hot
You don't believe me
Then pick a spot
But remember, I lick alot
Ayyo she likes to trick alot
Cause she got a bigga knot
Loves to see her nigga hot
Worries if I'm jigged or not
And her stuff--hot and divine
And the things she coppes--top of the line
Baby is hot and divine
Always poppin some wine
And then she told me
Cam, I got a rock on my mind

Chorus-2x's

[Cam'ron]

It feels good when you love em'
And they lovin you back
Go tit for tat
Never scratch your back
Matter of fact she touches and grabs
Not to lust you bad
Just to get you mad
When we alone she screams and moans
She don't front on me 
Cause she don't want to be alone
Come on
Everybody needs somebody
Spanish girls screamin out
Ay Papi!
Take her out 
Uh-huh no doubt
Then we lace her out
Uh-huh no doubt
Then we ski her out
[Usher]
Ski her out
[Cam]
Then we eat her out
[Usher]
Eat her out
[Cam]
Come on, where your man at?
Where's your plans at?
You ain't go away this year
Where your tan at?
Cause me and ma just came from the tropics
Wit her legs cocked
And she beggin me to stop it.
