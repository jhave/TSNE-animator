[Kid Rock]
Day by day my life gets colder
My ice grows thin, as I get older
Peace in peaces, bloody and bruised
I feel so helpless and confused

[Bridge]
Cuz I hear screamin on the left
yellin on the right
I'm sitting in the middle tryin to live my life

[Chorus]
Cuz I cant stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
I can't walk on water
I can't save your sons and daughters
I can't change the world and make things fair
The least that I can do
The least that I can do
The least that I can do is care

[Martina]
I pray and pray for life's salvation
Faith is tried and true in tribulation
Love is lost and lonely, check the news
And with these open arms I'll wait for you

[Bridge]
Cuz I hear screamin on the left
And yelling on the right
I'm sitting in the middle trying to live my life

[Chorus]
Cuz I cant stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
I can't walk on water
I can't save your sons and daughters
I can't change the world to make things fair
The least that I can do
The least that I can do
The least that I can do is care

[T.I.]
For the life of me, I can't see how the devil keeps enticing me
All you sees a felon, I know god can see whats right in me
How I can be labeled as a villain in the first place
When the worst case senerio is my birth place
Im just tryin to keep from fallin victim to the murder rate
Take my life lesson convincing the adolecents
There's a god up in heaven, sending down blessins
And your furture ain't brighter than ur present
Quit Stressin

They're screamin on the left
Yellin on the right
While I'm sittin in the middle trying to live my life

Cuz I cant stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
Cant walk on water I cant save ur sons and daughters
I cant change the world to make things fair
The least that I can do is care

Yeah I cant stop the war
Shelter homeless feed the poor
I cant walk on water
I cant save ur sons and daughters
I cant change the world and make things fair
The least that I can do
The least that I can do
The least that I can do
Oh is CARE</pre>
