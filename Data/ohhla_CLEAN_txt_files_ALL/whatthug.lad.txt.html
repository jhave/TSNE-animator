[Intro: La the Darkman, (DJ Rogers &amp; Puff)]
Yeah. Yeah. One. Two.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. (Oh)
Time for another cat get his money.
Ya'nah'mean? Let's just stroll alone.
(Havin money, havin money)
Word life. (Havin money)

[La the Darkman]
Yo, yo, life is hard, so I dedicate to God
Mad cats sell coke, tryin not to starve
Young girls sell vagina from Jersey to Carolina
Saw moms do it, she learned it as a minor
In poverty, life expectancy is short
Kids rob spots, push crack or play sports
In projects, single parents homes and techs
Islam, bass-heads and welfare checks
I'm tryin to eat, pushin wide-bodied whip through the streets
My whole fleet is wolves disquised as sheep
In society, the poor in America are miserable
Untrained, starvin like the children in Israel
First jewel since men spoke Hebrew
Now niggaz drink brew, guzzle Lucefer stew
Young E, only eleven, got a three-fifty-seven
And said he sold drugs by day cuz havin cream was heaven

[Chorus x2: DJ Rogers &amp; Puff]
What young thugs do for money
What young thugs do for money

[La the Darkman]
Yo, niggaz keep eyein me, my life is like administer society
I'm old dog, many fake thugs think of tryin me
Sorry, I'm the lion in this concrete safari
My Niggaz been in and out of jail since Atari
The street life is the only life I know
Puff trees, v12, my medallion glow
And I'm always gotti, but cats don't know me
My peoples run the island on Riker's and the Coney
I keep the new fresh, planned Clark's like Tony
I'm married to my guns in holy matrimony
With street raps, all the bullshit, you keep that
Rhyme for my niggaz on the corner that keep gats
Since school cats, niggaz incarcerated
All praises due to Allah cuz I made it

[Chorus x2]

[La the Darkman]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, as an adolestant, I grew up stressin
with a lust for jewelry, clothes and metal weapons
Based on the streets, life about cream and whip
Cells with the chip, big guns and big clips
A dime piece to strip and more bricks to flip
Ghetto novel, my lex shines like the Apollo
La songs, philosphies is a street Aristotel
It's policticians, catholics and christians
Kids who don't listen, on Riker's pissin
Life, can't play Cee-Lo with two dice
And you go through Hell just to come out right
Cuz we go through Hell just to come out right

[Chorus x4]

[Outro: DJ Rogers &amp; Puff]
Thugs that get that money (get that money)
Don't let money change you (don't let it change you)
(no, no, no, no) Thugs that get that money (ohhh)
Money, don't let money change you (don't let it change you)
(Ohh, no, no, don't let money change you)
(I'm tellin you, don't let it change you)
(Do you want the dollar? Got to have the money)
(Uh, got to have the money)
(Ain't worth the problem...)</pre>
