Yo bitch check this out

[Verse 1]
Woadey
Let me tell ya' sometin'
Bitch this ice right here, that shit ain't nothin'
Woadey
Check this out right here
Man I'm off that bottle and I rep that Bitch Mob
Now woadey
If you see me in traffic
Man I might have a thing and a few automatics
Now woadey
Man I'm off the showroom floor
Man I got that new shit cause I'm a bitch
Now woadey
I'm down to bust a head
After I caught that fake bitch my eyes is red
Now woadey
Nigga do your thang', man
And ask them niggas, man I swear they're crazy
Now woadey
You better call that bitch
And tell that ho you know Basedgod bitch
Woadey
I brought the strap like a faggot
And I lay I nigga down in that muthafucking casket
Now woadey
If I play with texts, man
I'm thinking about the bitch I'm a play with next
Shout out to Birdman
I'm off that lean with a 456
That mean I got a few bad bitches
That will do you down bad for the riches
You heard me?
An I'm not fucking playing
Badadangdangdang, Lil B is the mayne!

[Hook: x2]
Bitch suck my dick

Ho, go push the line

[Verse 2]
Do it up bitch

And the bitch know I brought the strap like a faggot
Lay a muthafucker down in that casket
