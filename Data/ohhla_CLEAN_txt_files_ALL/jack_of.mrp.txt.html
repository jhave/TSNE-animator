Typed by: IcyBlayze@hotmail.com

I caught you slipping so I took you with a gank move
listen up rap world its a new fool
a new gangsta, gangbanger, slanger, dope dealer
murdering motherfucker, headbanger
so listen to the tunes I tune up
its 91 Master P soon to come up
bodies and large lessons talk
you step to the P you come up short
the no limit mafia is out robbing
jack your beats, stealing and start siding
and you cant say shit, I bet you didnt
know your beak ill sound like this
and watch the ladies move
but the fellows ill laugh
cause they know you got took foo
haha another jack move

cause im the jack of the jackers
cause im the jack of the jackers
cause im the jack of the jackers
cause im the jack of the jackers

I kill for a gangsta beat, and ill snatch ya
to show my simply put a note in your casket
you just got dead by the jack of the jackers
in other words punk, huh, you aint a factor
the world is mines so I took it like scarface
you see a beat I ask for a funky 808
your style is out, its trying for a new trenz
you say real niggaz now were the fuck you been
you see real niggaz just dont sing
were im from we like to gangbang
ski-masks, catch a sucker just creeping
take a joury yo and leave ya sleeping
play ya like a fucking simp
fuck ya bitch and beat your kids with a tree limp
you see thats the life of crime
in other words you make yours
I like to take mine

*Repeat Chorus til end*</pre>
