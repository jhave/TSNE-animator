[V1]
Things move so fast and I can't stop them
Things move so fast and I can't stop them from moving
There's building swaying in the wind
Would you believe, it was just from passing them by
Things are moving so fast

So I keep on moving, and moving on
You know I keep on moving, and moving on, to keep up
Keep on moving on
You know I keep on moving, and moving on, to keep on
Keep on moving on

[V2]
I'm so lost inside my head
There's so many thoughts to contemplate
so many ways to move
And I don't know what to do with myself sometimes
So, I start reading the lines on my hands
And then I remember that fate is just a bullshit excuse for failure

Keep thinking you've got time
But there's not enough of it to spend to those you owe
And when they call collect
You still won't get the world to slow down
Things are moving so fast
So fast

So I keep on moving, and moving on
You know I keep on moving, and moving on, to keep up
Keep on moving on
You know I keep on moving, and moving on, to keep on
Keep on moving on

Keep treading; keep Moving on

Because time will fight against you
Because time will fight hard against you; work against you

Keep on moving, cause time is coming 'round</pre>
