[Intro: Kanye West (Ghostface Killah)]
It's ya boy Ne-Yo, we gonna do it like this
The Roc is in the building, yeah (It's the remix yo)
Kanye is in the building
(Yo, the monster don is in the building) we in here
(Kanye West is in the building) Ghostface (Your boy getting fat now
I got the fat stomach and laid up, eating good now
Other girl all stressed out, my girl got the fat ass
Shorty mad, pulling her hair out) Haha
Yeah, pardon me, if I lost my voice
I just got off stage, I'm in Japan right now
Sorry bout it...

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Bouncin' around, when I'm up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no

[Kanye West]
I'm high powered, put Eva Mendez to sleep
Yo pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week
But, back to you, mad gloss chick, you're way fit
How you have everything in this world and waste it
Prince told me it'll be ok, I'm so sick
Like Ne-Yo say, I'm laid back, like neo-soul
I holla back at this Creole hoe
She from the N.O., but she never told me, and oh so
We at the spot to chill, with a Fugee grill
So ordered the Kobe beef like Shaquille O'Neal
Second I walked in, the whole room got still
I don't know how to put this but, I'm kind of a big deal
And she conceited, she got a reason
She got her hair did, she got her weave in
And I'mma sweat that out, by the evening
You? I don't sweat that now, I got a new

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Oh girl, I can't believe you zoned out
Played me for this dude, nice shoes and a bottle of coast out Mont'
I'm that Don Wilson, first one
To put you up six suites in that Resident Hilton
Mink coach, colorful stones and big stacks
Yeah, I was fucking, but you don't get me back like that
Causing me grief, you know me and homey had beef
Now you got me losing my mind, out up in these streets
You'se flamingo, showing your true colors
Heard ya'll was ducking down low when you see my brothers
But it's all good, I move from ex to next
Got the baddest little chick to sign off of them checks
Fat bubble, her body's like one of the best
But I don't need to say nothing, ask Kanye West
She eye candy, smoother than Godiva chocolate
And you mad cuz you played ya self, it's your fault, trick

[Chorus]

[Ne-Yo]
Shot through the heart, the girl caught me
Shot through the block, with him shot gun
He lucky, I ain't stop, copped the shotgun
Killah type cat, you better be glad, I'm not one
Had a couple stars up in my sky
She was my moon and my sunshine
Dude ain't even fly, he just some guy
You blamed yourself, I'm done, peace, one

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
