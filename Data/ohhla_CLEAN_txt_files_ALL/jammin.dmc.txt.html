Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam

[Run-D.M.C.]
He's a one-man band, in his own right
Jam Master jams to the broad daylight
No instruments needed, just two record players
A stage, a crowd, and two rhyme sayers

[Run]
Ingredients are here, so have no fear
Definitely defy the position is clear

[Run-D.M.C.]
You couldn't be late, hesitate to debate
Jam Master is here and you could not wait

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
	{*half of guitar riff*}

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
	{*half of guitar riff + "WHOO!"*}

[Run-D.M.C.]
Now he's the Jam Master, and we're the emcee's
Like lightning and thunder, we're knockin down trees
While sucker DJ's, are bustin out Z's
My man Jam Master's stretchin hard 'cross seas
So why don't you listen, or you'll be missin
The cuts and the scratchin bass treble and the mixin
The force and the power comin hour after hour
So get up off the walls don't you be a wallflower

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
	{*guitar riff + half of "WHOO!"*}

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
	{*guitar riff + half of "WHOO!"*}

[Run-D.M.C.]
The alert is read, this is what we said
The meaning of Master means he's ahead
The meaning of Jam is ??
The records that he plays when the crowd's up on it
And when he comes on, the crowd goes off
It's all hard rock, there's nothing soft
..

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
	{*guitar riff + half of "WHOO!"*}

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
	{*guitar riff + half of "WHOO!"*}

[Run-D.M.C.]
He adds a little soul, to rock'n'roll
Every record that he touches, turns to gold
He's well conducted, self-instructed
His style's worthwhile, heavenly constructed
Mechanically inclined, and if you don't mind
He adds spice to your life time after time
I think it's bout time, to heed the long lecture
We rock our rhymes for the Jam Master

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
	{*guitar riff + half of "WHOO!"*}

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
	{*guitar riff + half of "WHOO!"*}

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
	{*guitar riff + half of "WHOO!"*}

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
	{*guitar riff + half of "WHOO!"*}

[D.M.C.] + overlaps last scratch
His name Jam Master, call him Jay
The crowd goes wild when he starts to play
Everything is correct, and A.O.K.
Jam Master's on the move but his sounds wills tay

	{*guitar riff + "WHOO!"*}

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
	{*half of guitar riff + "WHOO!"*}

[Run-D.M.C.]
From end to start, start to end
Not only does he scratch, but he's our friend
We could not wait, to let you see
[Run]	The things that he does for D and me

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
	{*guitar riff + "WHOO!"*}

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
	{*guitar riff + "WHOO!"*}

	Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
	Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
	{*guitar riff to fade*}
