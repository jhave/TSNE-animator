[Intro]
Flo Rida: I need a guarantee
Akon: eh, eh, eheh
Flo Rida: Akon are you with me?
Akon: Akon and Flo Rida
Flo Rida: The World is you with me?

[Chorus: Akon]
When I'm in the club Imma need me a few of the things that the bar can't bring
First it's money, second its me in the VIP full of guarantees
You gotta be down if I'm gonna spend amends on you
You gotta be down if I'm gonna spend amends on you
She gotta be down, gotta love, that's me
She gotta be down, for sure guarantee

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Be down for the cause, be my misses set it off, she can add to the po-po-po
had (?) some Betsy Ross, B-B-back up off the wall
satisfaction in my clause, satisfaction for my dawgs
I need passion from these broads
in the club do your strut guarantee me some love
I need answers, keep the questions lets agree to some touch
run the tab, let me grab, I don't need a paragraph
don't like talkin' on about flossin', only freaks on my staff

[Chorus: Akon]
When I'm in the club Imma need me a few of the things that the bar can't bring
First its money, second its me in the VIP full of guarantees
You gotta be down if I'm gonna spend amends on you
You gotta be down if I'm gonna spend amends on you
She gotta be down, gotta love, that's me
She gotta be down, for sure guarantee

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
All out all in, ninety-nine point nine percent
girl you can't be hesitant, love your ex? excellent
Want more x? lets be friends
unprescripted medicine, that's a problem I don't bother not even no evidence
I need to know,one, when you gonna go get it done hun
two you ain't gotta be my boo I got a buggati
I want when I'm at the bar, exclusive, shorty spit at me
no mucus, that don't mean I'll be your cupid
I ain't stupid baby, you can buzz

[Chorus: Akon]
When I'm in the club Imma need me a few of the things that the bar can't bring
First it's money, second its me in the VIP full of guarantees
You gotta be down if I'm gonna spend amends on you
You gotta be down if I'm gonna spend amends on you
She gotta be down, gotta love, that's me
She gotta be down, for sure guarantee

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Definitely a dime, right, when with me like flying kite
only cash, shows and ice
give Flo Rida sacrifice, shorty represent the night
stunting feed the appetite, say the price
paper tight, blow it like some candle light
VIP the whole clique, got the moon rock wrapped around my wrist
I'm about to waste, don't trip, like back in the day like 2 legit
where the love go, to my dub show
we're on the sexy ghetto, where'd your new patron get us

[Chorus: Akon]
When I'm in the club Imma need me a few of the things that the bar can't bring
First it's money, second its me in the VIP full of guarantees
You gotta be down if I'm gonna spend amends on you
You gotta be down if I'm gonna spend amends on you
She gotta be down, gotta love, that's me
She gotta be down, for sure guarantee</pre>
