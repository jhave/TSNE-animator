[Intro]
I will soothe your pain
That's what I say
I will ease your strains
But in real, but in real life
I got nuthin for you uh, uh
Nu, nu, nuthin for you

Uh, A black rainbow
Angel with a cracked hallow
I'll make you mine but you ain't taking up my last name though
God damn your smile is bloody uh
I guess I'll fuck you on a pile of money, Uh
You got the swagger of a woman with a dagger
And a crooked demeanor
But nah, I ain't lookin for neither
But I just love to watch you scratch your nails on the hood of your beamer
When I open you and push on the eather

[Chorus]
I will soothe your pain
That's what I say
I will ease your strains
But in real, but in real life
I got nuthin for you uh, uh
Nu, nu, nuthin for you
But in real, but in real life
I got nuthin for you to gain

Black rainbow, funeral, eclipse...
Black raincoat, beautiful, deep kiss...
Taste like DMT
Digging your bf a grave site secretly, secretly
Watch the stage lights secretly
Leave with me
In the grey night creep with me
I must, have an affinity for sick disease
Cause this affair is fucking
HIV to me
Alcoholic red wine
Aderal at bedtime
Make it so I have to call you next time
I just don't feel right every time I get you out your black gown
Your boyfrend's is textin in the back ground
God damn, you got the swagger of a woman with a dagger
That just stood under a ladder
Holding 13 black cats
And took each one threw it at a mirror till it shattered to the floor
My irises are blacker than before

[Chorus]
I will soothe your pain
That's what I say to her
I will ease your strains, yea
But in real, but in real life
I got nuthin for you
Uh, uh
Nu, nu, nuthin for you
But in real, but in real life
I got nuthin for you to gain
Nuthin at all...

Yo, Black double rainbow
O God it's luminescent
Are we being stupid?
That's a stupid question
I 'm just lookin at the diamond on your finger
Just Remembering the fact that I ain't buy it for you either,
But in real life
You make me feel like a slut
So I'm a make you kneel like I'm tut
Bow to me
Like a God
Cause this dude loves you like the goddess that you aren't and your with me
You should be proud truly
Actin like it's such a special occasion
Actin like it's such a clever liaison
I think you got the devil emblazoned
Under the fabric of your negligÃ©e
The way you look at me
It's like your practicing for wedding day
But in real life
He loves you
I don't even fucking know you
Wait a second; I should say that to myself again
He loves her
But he don't even know that you exist
So say goodbye
Blow her one more kiss
You wouldn't give crack to a crack addict
So try to be a little pragmatic
You should go find something true
Stop being taboo
Tell the dude the same exact thing too

[Chorus]
I will soothe your pain
I will ease your strains, uh
But in real, but in real life
I got nuthin for you
But in real, but in real life
Nu, nu, nuthin for you
Uh, But in real, but in real life
I got nuthin for you to gain
Uh, But in real, but in real life
But in real ass life uh</pre>
