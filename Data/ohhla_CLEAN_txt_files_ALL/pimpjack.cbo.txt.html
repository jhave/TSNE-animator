[C-Bo] (Too $hort)
Man, it sure has been a long time mayne... you know?
Got the fuck out the gate though
$hort Dog, check these bitches man
(Ay yo C-Bo) Ha, what is it my nigga? (What's up mayne?)
Ah you know, keepin' it gangsta fo sho' (Yeah)
(These niggaz out here tryin' to player hate on the West man)
Fuck them niggaz (Spit that shit nigga)

[C-Bo]
I give a fuck where you from fool I'm ridin' with $hort
If I step in the ring and scream kill they dyin' for sure
You better ask these niggaz, from high death to the top
I had to answer these niggaz, bone crusher blast at these niggaz
There ain't no fast in these niggaz, all my niggaz gotta eat
So it's a must that I crush ki's, if I'm smearin' I dust up many
Bustin' slugs up any, from The Yay to GA
Heard the fed's at the house, gotta use the spray with the 'K
Twenty pounds of criptonite on a plane (on a plane)
Ten metrograph birds on a train (on a train)
Ten years down the line doin' the same thang
Nigga fresh up out the pen bangin' the same gang
On parole, fo-fifth stay aimed to flame
Rearrange a nigga brain, bitch we bring the pain
$hort Dog my nigga, we ride 'til death do us
Only way to face death is to put a teflon through us

[Chorus: C-Bo]
Me and $hort forever stack doe, and keep it crackin'
If the music ain't stackin', he pimpin' bitch and I'm jackin'
On the track with a full metal jacket, yellin' fuck the world
Westside gon' have it, what?!
Me and $hort forever stack doe, and keep it crackin'
If the music ain't stackin', he pimpin' bitch and I'm jackin'
On the track with a full metal jacket, yellin' fuck the world
Westside gon' have it, uh

[Too $hort]
I know all about these nothin' ass hoes
Niggaz you can't trust and how this street life goes
I gotta hustle, that's all I ever think about
If I gotta stand on the corner when the fiends come out
If my raps don't sell, I'm pimpin' Sonia
Cause pussy never stop sellin' in California
Turn a bitch into a hoe...
Even had a bitch rappin' in the studio
Turnin' tricks, suckin' dicks in a video
If you see some money you better get it hoe
You know I gotta eat good, this ain't no joke
We got bitches, music, and we slangin' dope
Up all night, tryin' to make more cash
Police always tryin' to take your stash
They need to just let a player do his thang
Eat steak everyday and make some loose change

[Chorus: C-Bo]
Me and $hort forever stack doe, and keep it crackin'
If the music ain't stackin', he pimpin' bitch and I'm jackin'
On the track with a full metal jacket, yellin' fuck the world
The Westside gon' have it, what?!
Me and $hort forever stack doe, and keep it crackin'
If the music ain't stackin', he pimpin' bitch and I'm jackin'
On the track with a full metal jacket, yellin' fuck the world
The Westside gon' have it, uh

[C-Bo]
It's fuck a bitch, get rich, put a snitch in a ditch
Keep a clip full of hollow-tips that'll slang from the hip
Fo'-fifth flame and flip, bodies like a Gotti
Once my infrared spot him I rise and I got him
Fuckin' with a killer, stay on the chase for the millas
Fat house on the hilla, Benz truck, 20 inch wheelas
600 blunted, to the airport then scoop $hort
Fat heater on lap, I dare any nigga to step forth
Get smoked of course, blasted, in a casket
Murder them bastards, leave the whole scene drastic

[Too $hort]
Jumped in the car with C-Bo, on the way to the liquor sto'
Before we go get some more indo
So we can smoke and ride
Cause I'ma stay high for the rest of my life
Independent in a major way
I know you love the way us players play
I wasn't born with a silver spoon, but I stay hungry
Bitches hear what I say and everyday they want me

[Chorus: C-Bo]
Me and $hort forever stack doe, and keep it crackin'
If the music ain't stackin', he pimpin' bitch and I'm jackin'
On the track with a full metal jacket, yellin' fuck the world
The Westside gon' have it, uh
Me and $hort forever stack doe, and keep it crackin'
If the music ain't stackin', he pimpin' bitch and I'm jackin'
On the track with a full metal jacket, yellin' fuck the world
The Westside gon' have it, nigga</pre>
