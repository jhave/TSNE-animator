Good evening, This is Los Angelos 

A lonely teenage daydream 
Of things I just might be 
A surreal kind of thinking 
Keeps on drifting in on me 
My twisted body is lifeless 
Not so their twisted minds 
Peace through power their motto 
Power through peace their crime 

Product of our environment (x8) 

Maybe one day they will legalize weed 
In the year TWO "G" the planet could be deceased 
We plead to the fleece while we're beggin' on our knees 
In our hometown Cali with bears and green trees 
Birds and the bees, hot sand on the beach 
Shells in the sea and I'm living in peace 
Like a dog on a leash locked up with no key 
I gotta smoke under cover, Motherfuck the police 

Yeah, see the matching hand and they're robbing from the hat 
The laws an illusion to symbolize that 
Putting us in jail for the with us living tax tax 
I can see the wires in the levitating act 
I can hear the lies and they're calling them facts 
I can see the bars and they're lookin all cracked 
I read between the lines but the lines are all crap 
I can feel the knife turning in my back 

How would life be if the world smoked weed? 
Guaranteed there'd be peace not greed 
See, it's hell 
Living in a cell 
Legalize the plant only time will tell 

How would life be if the world smoked weed? 
Guaranteed there'd be peace not greed 
See, it's hell 
Living in a cell 
Legalize the plant only time will tell 

You are a sacred being of light 
Projected into reality for a purpose 
Demand the right to your moment 
In this holographic gift with no rules, no borders 
Except for those who you choose to accept and live by 

Abolish government is nothing to me 
Forget about god, he's not here to see 
We live by a system, a perfect mold 
People perfect people who are poor and old 
Lies were spent on a sad defense 
They said we're lookin for a method in this world ??? 
Presidents are named 
Presidents are labeled highest man on the government table 

America, land of the free 
Free to the power of the people in uniform (x2) 

How would life be if the world smoked weed? 
Guaranteed there'd be peace not greed 
See, it's hell 
Living in a cell 
Legalize the plant only time will tell 

How would life be if the world smoked weed? 
Guaranteed there'd be peace not greed 
See, it's hell 
Living in a cell 
Legalize the plant only time will tell 

Society, fuck it! 
I've had enough! 
The system's full of crooks, straight up corrupt 
You look like a decoy bobbing like a duck 
And your money keeps em smokin on a BC Bluff 
You're caught up in the headlights of my V-Dub bus 
TSOL and the Kings about to even things up 
Your birds will take all the air out the sky 
Bring em down to our level 
You can work, can't hide 

Product of our environment (x8) 

A lonely teenage daydream 
Of things I just might be 
A surreal kind of thinking 
Keeps on drifting in on me 
My twisted body is lifeless 
Not so their twisted minds 
Peace through power their motto 
Power through peace their crime 

The government keeps our control over the population 
While the schools teach the kids restricted education 
Murder, Rape, Sex, and Underage prostitution 
They got the war on pot, they got the wrong solution 

I wake and I bake, nowhere to escape 
Livin' life in a tank they invade my space 
Betrayed full of hate while they're shootin all blanks 
Society's lost in a paranoid state 

It's the illusion of ownership, It's take what you can get 
The banks are the loan sharks and everyone's in debt 
And if you get ahead how quickly you forget 
You're hanging from a burning rope without a safety net 
They tax you when you sell 
They tax you when you buy 
They take half when you live 
Then they take half when you die 
These are the lies that they are stating as facts 
I can see the wires of the levitating act 

How would life be if the world smoked weed? 
Guaranteed there'd be peace not greed 
See, it's hell 
Living in a cell 
Legalize the plant only time will tell 

How would life be if the world smoked weed? 
Guaranteed there'd be peace not greed 
See, it's hell 
Living in a cell 
Legalize the plant only time will tell 

I'm glad that I can read 
I'm glad that I can write 
I read their fuckin bullshit 
Every single night 
When off in my head went a little fuckin light 
It told me what was wrong it told me what was right 
World bank-Power and control 
Issuing the money and they're dollin' out the roles 
Charging what they want to with the money, the control 
Living in their nightmare, giving them your soul!</pre>
