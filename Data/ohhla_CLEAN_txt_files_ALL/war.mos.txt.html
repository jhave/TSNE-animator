War is a global economic phenomenon

Ain't a batch of guns on where, hellfire
Spittin', run up everything they hittin'
Some do they job to dodge the barrage
As sleek projectiles never stay bound
Fire bite invades the night with light
Loud, fighter planes shout shell rain
When they shot to kill cops on the terrain
And leave any brain that may remain stained
You god damn right this war goin' too far
Socialists think they converse with the stars
Wars found, my find the beauty in the stars
I level with death even beneath radar
I level with death even beneath radar
I level with death and she got pretty eyes
Nobody told me death was so damn fine
I go to sleep with that girl on my mind
Wake up in a sea, I wanna fire in line
Grab my heat, then it's get down time
One day I'ma make that girl all mine
But for now I'm a soldier abidin' my time
Writin' my rhyme behind enemy lines
Palestine, Kosovo, Cashmere
No different than the avenues right here
An increase in the murder rate each year
Paramilitary unit keep the streets clear
Curtains up on the theatre of warfare
Dramatic politics nightly preformed here
Worldwide from Colombia to Columbine
Don holders keep ya dollar signs on the line

"I don't want to rule or conquer anyone
I should like to help everyone if possible
Jew, gentile, black man, white
We all want to help one another
Human beings are like that
We want to live by each other's happiness
Not by each other's misery
In this world, there's room for everyone
And the good earth is rich
And can provide for everyone a way of life"

Fuck that

You know the drill
Fix ya face
I'ma hustle off the hill
Go get my money man
Go get my money man

See every hunter need to kill
Go get my money man

I'm old school from off the hill
Go get my money man

Go get my money man
I give a fuck what I do
Go get my money man
Go get my money man
Go get that money man
Go get my money man
Go get that money man
Gimme my money man
Gimme my money

Fuck you, pay me
Fuck you, pay me
Fuck you, pay me
Fuck you, pay me
Fuck you, pay me
Fuck you, pay me
Fuck you, pay me
Fuck you, pay me
Gimme the loot, Gimme the loot, Gimme the loot</pre>
