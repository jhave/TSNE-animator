[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
When you hear the song, role down yah window
Let the music thump yeah, thump thump thump thump
Take a walk in the club, thats how I roll
You look so so down, so so so so
Now when you step out on the scene, so fresh so clean
Lookin like a wet dream, yo know what I mean

Wind yah waist line to the base line
Slow it down now get the beat right
