When I was twelve, while checking the mail
I was admirin' the car of the man next door
And thinkin' to myself, man, one of these days
I'm gonna have me a house like that, with a big red door
And his yard was mowed, and his grass was green
And the driveway was edged and all the shrubs were trimmed so perfectly
I had a crush on his wife and I played ball with his son
I pondered how much money he made, went inside and turned the TV on

And he was layin'
In an overflowing bathtub of red water
The first and the last time he ever relaxed
And they said
He had a smile on his face, his final offer
The steam on the mirror said, I got one more thing to say

I was watchin' TV, havin' one of mum's famous rice crispy treats
Watching Tom &amp; Jerry, I heard a car, horn beeped
I ran to the window, his wife and son were home
With bags of stuff they had got at the mall
I went in my room and got my glove and ball
I leapt up the steps and asked his son could he play
And his son looked at his wife and his wife told his son I guess it'll be ok
That beautiful woman, she walked in that beautiful house
When I realised I forgot my hat I said I'll be right back and turned around

And he was layin'
In an overflowing bathtub of red water
The first and the last time he ever relaxed
And they said
He had a smile on his face, his final offer
The steam on the mirror said, I got one more thing to say

There was screaming, there was crying
There was silence, I thought I was dreamin'
And the sun was shining, it was a beautiful day
His wife was talking to an officer, through the noise I heard her say

And he was layin'
In an overflowing bathtub of red water
The first and the last time he ever relaxed
And they said
He had a smile on his face, his final offer
The steam on the mirror said

And he was layin'
In an overflowing bathtub of red water
The first and the last time he ever relaxed
And they said
He had a smile on his face, his final offer
The steam on the mirror said

And he was layin'
In an overflowing bathtub of red water
The first and the last time he ever relaxed
And they said
He had a smile on his face, his final offer
The steam on the mirror said, I got one more thing to say</pre>
