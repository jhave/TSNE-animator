Domm, doom, doom, doom, doom 

(Krazie) 
Killa 

(All Bone) 
Me killa, mi killa 
Drug dealer, scandalous nigga 
Lous nigga, -lous nigga 
Come again me say, me killa, me killa, me killa 
Gravedigger, scandalous nigga 
Lous nigga, -lous nigga, -lous nigga. 
Caught ya slippin' so I had to put a slug up in your chest 
Should've wore that vest 
Talkin' shit'll only get that ass put to rest 
A nigga, come, come flex 
Hey, get the llello, don't fuck with the Bone 
When I'm hangin' and bangin' and slangin' 
Swangin' blows to the dome 
Nigga, watch that chrome 
Bodybag that ass on, home 
Me killa, me killa, me killa </pre>
