My heart is broke, my will is gone 
Fell in love with a woman named Babylon 
She hook me to the gills all of her forbidden thrills 
I call her baby for short then I ramble on 
She'll forget about me, my soul is high, my mind is free 
Met a shorty with some back call her destiny 
She showed me all my fates, my stream of conscious navigates 
I orbit 'round the sun at high velocity 
Don't forget 'bout me, don't forget about sweet things 
Won't you save my soul Pretty lady, won't you take me home...tonight 
My arms are heavy, my body's tense 
Got the hot's for this honey named confidence 
She points out all of my flaws, breaking all of her favorite laws 
Never speaks a word in my defense, just forget about me 
My spirit's weak, my lust will thrive, got a thing for this bitch 
Said her name is a lie, she controls me with her fear, 
My prayers fall on her cold deaf ear, 
She says have a good time and take your dive 
Just forget about me 
Just forget about, sweet things, won't you save my soul yeah 
Pretty lady, won't you take me home 
Sweet thing won't you save my soul yeah 
Pretty lady won't you take me home... tonight 
I've got a Babylon feelin', I've got a Babylon feelin' 
I've got a Babylon feelin', I'm feelin' Babylon
My heart is broke, my will is gone 
Fell in love with a woman named Babylon 
Shook hook me to the gills, all of her forbidden thrills
I call her baby for short, then I ramble on, and I ramble on
I've got a Babylon feelin' 
I've got a Babylon feelin'
I've got a Babylon feelin' Feeln', Feeln', Feeln' yeah 
I've got a Babylon feelin' Feeln', Feeln', Feeln' yeah </pre>
