Big Benjamin's, my etiquette
Black shades on, black excellence
Big ego, less settlin'
Turn the lights on, Tom Edison
Oh, we on we on like we invented it
We on on on Tom Edison
Oh, we on we on like we invented it
We on on on Tom Edison
Turn the lights on, Tom Edison
We on yea yea we on

they wanna look at me y'all crazy
Alpha Omega, the NRBO baby
I'm so authentic that they don't think your boy did it
They must be at their noodles that they don't pen it
Alla rocka I'd advise you notta
Go against me I'm I'll like Foxy Brands Nana
We party hard, y'all funny niggas is har dee har
And hall it hard that top go where your bodyguard
Kevin Costner, fake phony impostor
All to do is talk a good game like Rob Custard
Rumors that they held my bro hostage
Stop us and this mafia, we got all the bosses in pocket
In New York gang who's popping and the Boston market
I may come across friendly till you cross the market
I'm a lover young cupid never lost a target
You ain't talkin' big things, you ain't talkin' my joggie

Big Benjamin's, my etiquette
Black shades on, black excellence
Big ego, less settlin'
Turn the lights on, Tom Edison
Oh, we on we on like we invented it
We on on on Tom Edison
Oh, we on we on like we invented it
We on on on Tom Edison
Turn the lights on, Tom Edison
We on yea yea we on

I'm a mastermind who mastered money
Niggas sayin' I can't rhyme that's a acid line
On a scale of one to ten I come after nine
You half of mine so that makes a Jackson Five
I'm a ambitious, all my vehicles match my drive
I' so strong like I could splash by tides
That's besides the point
You transgrammar with you glass disguise
Can't see that I'm the truth and need new glasses huh?
Oh it ain't fear, cha chea it ain't fear
Say I got a free ride, free ride no fear
I hear you never stood on the wealthy line
People be thinking just because I come from wealth I'm fine
No, I mean the money do help at times
Yea, I know you wanna judge for yourself that's fine
But trust me, you never know who's your friends
Upper class is phony, they all know how to pretend
I remember in school people used to be so cruel
Sayin' things like ya think ya cool because you're you
My reply was no, I think I'm cool cause I do
And I think I'm a pretty swell guy and so should you, cool?
But anyway, back to the matter
I be dropping signs on them fractions of matter
I do it for all the people who actually matter
Those who hated wanna say once I passed on a ladder uh
Now we on, no cut off switch
This beat thang why would cut off this this this

Big Benjamin's, my etiquette
Black shades on, black excellence
Big ego, less settlin'
Turn the lights on, Tom Edison
Oh, we on we on like we invented it
We on on on Tom Edison
Oh, we on we on like we invented it
We on on on Tom Edison
Turn the lights on, Tom Edison
We on yea yea we on</pre>
