[Verse One] [MURS]
Now why you gotta give me attitude for young lady?
Them lips and them curves will drive a grown man crazy
Wasn't trying to be rude
I was just thinking maybe 
We'd talk a little bit
And later on make some babies

[Eligh]
Then she stepped in my direction
Angelic face to my drunken sway
PSC led her to me 
Through a dark club in San Jose
Had no way to identify 
What was right in front of my eyes
Smoking beedies with my guys
MURS was there he can testify (Amen)
I was swallowed up by love 
and what followed up were doves 
In the garden of my bedroom where we frolicked
Pendulum didn't mean a thing
She put on one of my black t-shirts 
A polaroid in the back of my cabinet
Never throw it away
But now I can tell you fellas
Love is a weed when you don't water it properly
Stopping me in my tracks
Heart attack can't relax
The artifacts on the road to become a man are hard to take 
To face the heart break
These taste the hard steaks/stakes

[Scarub]
Sunday banana splittin'
Monday for chocolate fudgin'
Tuesday vanilla frenchin'
Wednesday cinnamon lovin'
Thursday neapolitian 
Friday let's lemon meringue ya thang with a twist
Saturdays we can do what you wish

[Chorus]
And if ya had ya heart broken can't find ya way back
And if ya
Teach me and love me then girl it's on
And if ya
Wonder where my heart is next to yours it be at
And if ya
Caught a deaf tone from being left alone
And if ya
Only got about a B cup then it's cool
And if ya
Show me yours then I'll show you mine
And if ya
Trust in me then I'll trust in you
And if ya
Come with me I know you'll change your mind

[Verse Two] [Eligh]
You seek my company but I'm not up for that
Just want to lay you on your back
Don't want to conversate in fact
Don't know if we should kick it at all
Don't want to cause your heart to fall
Don't want to be that man
I'm not the one
I'm not at all

[MURS]
The hardest thing I ever had to do was break your heart
Kinda knew our relationship was doomed from the start
Cause after we'd fight you would listen to Gwen
She kinda always knew she'd end up my ex-girlfriend
And now that shit's true
No Doubt 
Treated her like royalty whenever we'd go out
I bought her Hollister 
New Cenies 
Volcom 
Triple 5 Soul
And a bunch of other tokens
Trips to New York
Japan
Oakland
So when you say I never loved you it's insultin'
Cool as a couple maybe better not together
Plus I know I was a good boyfriends so, whatever

[Scarub]
I'm my father's son
Yeah a momma's boy
With some brotherly love
Love pretty girls oh boy
Got this half
You could make it whole
Let's enjoy 
Moments while they last
Let's play, you could be my favorite toy

[Chorus]
And if ya had ya heart broken can't find ya way back
And if ya
Teach me and love me then girl it's on
And if ya
Wonder where my heart is next to yours it be at
And if ya
Caught a deaf tone from being left alone
And if ya
Only got about a B cup then it's cool
And if ya
Show me yours then I'll show you mine
And if ya
Trust in me then I'll trust in you
And if ya
Come with me I know you'll change your mind

[MURS]
And if I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
I'm a single young man at his sexual peak 
Type to need a different freak everyday of the week

[Scarub]
Yeah, I use to know this girl as fly as Saturdays
With a wholesome type of soul like a Sunday
Had a straight up approach like a Monday
Strong head, long legs that stretched past Tuesday
Woozy 
I felt, knew it was love came Wednesday
I was hooked, yeah fuck what my friends say
My hearts a flower, her water Thursday I'm thirsty
Friday she left me and I withered in the worst way
Yeah, for her I was weak
Melancholy for months
Through it all learned how to separate my needs from my wants
And what I need is what you got
If what you got done front
Happiness, a journey not a destination
I'm willing to run

[Eligh]
For once
Everything's gonna be alright
Summer days will come our way
Morning comes to bring brighter suns
Clouds part for the weaker hearts
Camaraderie with your boys on a Sunday afternoon
What's better than that?
Staring at asses passing 
Hollering and laughing

[Outro] [MURS talking]
Hey, hey hey girl. Hey, did you see that?
She got an ass like hallelujah and a face like praise Jesus.
I need to go to Bible study. Get naked for Jesus!</pre>
