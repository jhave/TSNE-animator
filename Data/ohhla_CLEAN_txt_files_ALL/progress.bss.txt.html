[Bo$$]
Who am I to flip a wicked Bitch? 
Business is Business 
But now the revelation has revealed  
How the Bo$$ Bitch is trying to get rich! 
And doing a good job 
And rippin' up the pavement with 'nuff shit 
Aww shit!! 
I think I jumped into a maze 
And now I'm being surrounded by dead niggaz in a daze 
Some kind of way I have become a slave 
Yes sir Masta 
No sir Masta 
I work fasta, even if it means my brain being tampered with 
Fuck it! 
At least I got rid of the pamper 
Lata on I mix up with some G's 
Kickin' it on the corner curb 
Talkin' about expanding to Pittsburgh 
I'm out here on the cut smokin' bud with Macaroni 
Instead of us servin' niggas this fucka's tryin' to bone me 
But I ain't trying to hear this Bitch made elf 
I ain't in the mood 
Cause I don't fuck around with the help bastard! 
If it wasn't for the dope that we got stashed in the casket 
I'd have your ass hit 
Then watch the fool die trickin! 
While I be countin' crispy ass dollars  
Like Louisana fried chicken 
And takin a sip of his favorite drink 
At the grave as I stare through the shade 
Your shit still stinks! 
I wasn't tryin' to see an explanation 
Cause as far as I'm concerned the only way to progress 
Is through elimination! 

Hook:   
Got's to go yeah  
Got to go 
The Bo$$ no loss 
What ever the cost 
Elimination 
Got's to go yeah 
Got to go 

[Bo$$]
Time is running out I'm still self employed 
They talking this Pitt shit but I'm tryin to get back to DETROIT! 
Fuck it if I need to do these niggas I'm a do 'em too 
And step the fuck off as if I never knew them fools 
See ya! 
Now the shit is going my way 
I'm hittin' the highway 
No mo' drive by's  
In my drive way 
This is what's happening 
I'm finally at my destination 
I ain't one of 'dem bitches tryin' 
I gotta get crackin' fuck a curling iron 
I'll get that shit did lata 
Meanwhile I'm on some ol' 
Bucka a sucka quick shit fo paper and 
I'm disectin' at the same time progressin' 
Eliminating like a lunatic shootin quick 
Call it what you want but I'll be brief 
I don't trust a motha fucka 
Unless a motha fucka is me g! 
Getting' sweated is just an inspiration 
So I don't regret it when you get your BC date 
Cause it's all about elimination 
(got to go yeah, got to go) 
Fuck up and I'll have yo ass hitch hikin'  
From Idaho Yo! 
Bo$$ is knockin' out silly shit 
Let me hit this philly spliff 
Now it's time to really trip 
I gettin the feelin' that these niggas 
Is into my shit 
Plus the muchies got me wanting a burger 
But first the murder 
Knockin' em off was a cinch but I'm stuck 
And ain't no way that I'm a rest my head on 
Another bench Fuck! 
I'm sick of this shit 
Let me slip into this alley  
And try to fly as high as I can get 
With 200 blunts and 100 spliffs 
(tryin to make it to Detroit, Detroit) 
Now every member of my click is in his grave 
I'm truly the BO$$ bitch now 
Nobody's slave! 
How do I plea? 
Listen! I'll neva give an explanation 
Cause as far as I'm concerned 
The only way to progress is through 
Elimination! 

Hook: 

Gots to go yeah got to go 
The BO$$ no loss 
At whateva the cost 
Elimination </pre>
