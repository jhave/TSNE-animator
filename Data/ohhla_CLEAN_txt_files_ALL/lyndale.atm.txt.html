[Chorus]
We could try to change to make a new life
Don't mean we gon' do right tonight
We could try to change to make a new life
Don't mean we gon' do right tonight

[Refrain]
Hey mother, don't let them know you
They hunger to hold you down and control you
Hey lover, don't let 'em love you
They'll lay on top of you to stay above you

[Chorus] {X2}
We could try to change to make a new life
Don't mean we gon' do right tonight
We could try to change to make a new life
Don't mean we gon' do right tonight

[Verse 1]
We all need something we can stake the blame on
It can't be your dance that made this rain storm
It must be the alcohol, and you hate this place cos the town's too small
And everybody there's so fake
Be a brand new day if they was half awake
Smile'n your face like 'yes sir'
Waitin til ya turn your back so they can whisper
And you ain't tryin' to love none of 'em
Na, ya know better right? Ya learned something
But even If The first few burst through
They only pursue cause they wanna hurt you
It comes with a smokers cough
Gonna turn it on until it's broken off
Cos suffering didn't crush his 'just not enough'
They wanna hold you down until they lock you up

[Chorus] {X2}
We could try to change to make a new life
Don't mean we gon' do right tonight
We could try to change to make a new life
Don't mean we gon' do right tonight

[Refrain]
Hey sister, don't let them touch you
So friendly when they're close enough to cut you
Hey mister, don't let them break you</pre>
