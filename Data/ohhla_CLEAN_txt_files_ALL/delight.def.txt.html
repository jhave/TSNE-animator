[Redman]
I said a hip hop the hippie
the hippie to the hip hip a hop and ya don't stop 
A rock on baby bubba to the boogety bang
bang the boogie to the boogety beat
Now what'chu hear is not a test I'm a rappin to the beat
It's just me the groove and my squad we gonna try to move your feet
See I am the doctor spoc and I'd like to say hello
A to the black to the white the red and the brown
the purple and yellow
Well, first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
say up jump the boogie to 
Bang bang boogie let's rock you don't stop 
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Now, so far you heard my voice a but I brought 2 friends along
And next on the mic is my man E come on E sing that song

[Erick Sermon]
Well I'm imp the dip the ladies pimp
The womens fight for my delight
Cuz im the grandmaster with the 3 MCs
That shocked ya house for the young ladies
And when ya come inside into the front
And you do the freak spank and you do the bump
An When a sucka MCs tryin to prove a point
They trust this trio and wit a serious joint
And from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit back and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that lyricals never cease
I created a devastated masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist
EVERYBODY! I said it goes like this
See I was comin home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she heard stories and she heard fables 
That I Mrs. On the mic and the turntables 
This young reporter I did adore 
Start rockin through this rhyme like I never did before 
She said damn fly guy I'm in love wit'chu
Said that casanova led ya musta been true
I said by the way baby what's your name?
She said I go by the name of Lois Lane 
And you could be my boyfriend you truly can 
Just let me cut my boyfriend called Superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flyin through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he look like a sucka in a blue &amp; red suit
I said I need a man who got finesse
and his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But he can't rock a party through the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm 
But I can bust you out with my Supersperm
I go do it - I go do it - I go do it - do it - do it 
And I'm here and I'm there 
And I'm big bad E and I'm everywhere
So just throw your hands up in the air
And party hard like you just don't care
And just do it and don't stop y'all
A tick a tock y'all and ya don't stop
It goes ho-tel, mo-tel What'cha gonna do today(Say Wha'?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, I'm gonna get some spankin'
Drive off with a def OJ
Everybody go, Ho-tel, Mo-tel Hoilday Inn(Say Wha'?)
I say if your girl start actin' up 
Then you take her friend
I say Skip, Dive What can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust 'em out
And leave the rest to Master Gee 
So he can shock the house!

[Keith Murray]
Well I'm the M - A - S - the T - E - R a G with the double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Keith Murray 
Well, my name is known all over the world
by all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin down in history 
As the baddest rapper there ever could be 
Now I'm feelin the highs and your feelin the lows 
The beat start gettin into your soul 
You start snappin your fingers and stompin your feet
And moving your body to the shore shot beat 
And then DAMN! You start doin the freak
I mean DAMN! Right outta your seat
And then you throw your hands high in the air 
Your rockin to the beat and shake your derriere
Your rockin to the beat without a care 
'Cause the shore shot MCs from the affair
Now I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I gotta slim face and a pair of brown eyes 
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize 
I said a on and a on an on on an on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a on and a on an on on an on
Like a hot butta pop ta pop hippie hippie pop ta pop pop 
you don't dare stop 
Come alive y'all and gimme what'chu got
I guess by now that you can take a hunch
And find that I, am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep it strive
Cuz all I'm made to do is wiggle your behind
An sing a on and a on an on on an on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a on and a on an on on an on
Rock, rock y'all, and get on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gonna freak you there
I'm gonna freak you out of this atmosphere
Cuz I'm one-of-a-kind, I shocked your mind
Look what they did Gee, No diggity about your behind
I said a one, two, three, four
Come on girls a-get on the floor
Come alive y'all and gimme what'chu got
Cuz I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said a one, two, three, four
Tell me Dr. Spoc What are you waitin' for?

[Redman] 
I said a hip hop the hippie to tha hippie the hip hip a hop 
An ya don't stop a rockin to the bang bang boogie 
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogety beat
Skippity we bopp we rock a scooby doo 
A guess what america we love you
Cuz you rock &amp; you roll with a so much soul 
A you could rock till you 101 years old
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
But Def Squad's like butter on ya breakfast toast
A rock it out a baby bubba a baby bubba to the boogety 
Bang bang the boogie to the beat beat
It's So unique come on everybody 
Let's dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friend house to eat
And the food was just no good?
I said the macaroni's sour, the peas all mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
I said you try to play it off, like you thinkin' you can
By sayin' that chu're full
And then your friend says, Mom, he's just bein' polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, thats bull!
So your heart start pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you arleady ate
And then your friend says, Man, there's plenty of food
So he piles some more on your plate
And while the stinky food's steamy 
Your mouth starts a-dreamin' of the monent it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate, and your chicken's slowly rottin'
And the somethin' that look like cheese
Then you say, that's it, I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this Ug-ly food that stinks
So you bust out the door, while it's still close
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief from a bottle uh Kaopectate
And then you call your friend a two weeks later To see how he has been
And he says I understand about the food, Baby Bubba
But we're still friends
A wit a hip hop the hippie to tha hippie the hip hip a hop 
You don't stop a rockin to the bang bang boogie 
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogety beat
