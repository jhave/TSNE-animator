Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
At first they appreciate
And then you worth to appreciate, I'm good money
I initiate the break up, wait up
Ball player finger roll with him who she lay it up
So I stayed up, she pulled on the block
Round 6 o'clock nigga straight up
I start to giggle, she smell all sprayed up
She shocked to see me on the way up
She said she took a OJ, it's cold I'm heated
Thinking more OJ, in the cold just leave it
That's me and third person
What we about, your whereabouts, I heard you was workin
That's what you told me, wait, wait
Why your eyes watery?
What you mean hold me?
What we had girls gone in the wind
Just call my cabin never call me again

[Chorus]
So good, how the hell we get so wrong?
So together, how the hell we get so torn?
Fuck it, we throw in the wind or
Fuck it, we blowin in the wind
I ain't never ever felt like this for no one
But if you say it's over there but is it done done?
Fuck it, we throw in the wind or
Fuck it, we blowin in the wind

[Verse 2]
Now I'm in the presidential, all by myself
Presidential, Obama, self
Before it felt like wealth now all this weight on my chest
Kind of felt like Phelps
Meaning his medals
Before in any evening it was rose petals
And this the recovery stage, as Derek Rose petals
Planning his return
I compare it, it's sorta similar
I'm reminded that it burns
My concern are no longer there
To keep it sure, I no longer care
And you can blame yourself for that
Was giving you the benjies
You was stingy with your selfish acts
This from heaven from my boys
Well on me you was sending
Now I'm sending you to voice mail
What we had girl's gone in the wind
I can't call it, never call me again
Nah, for real

[Chorus]
So good, how the hell we get so wrong?
So together, how the hell we get so torn?
Fuck it, we throw in the wind or
Fuck it, we blowin in the wind
I ain't never ever felt like this for no one
But if you say it's over there but is it done done?
Fuck it, we throw in the wind or
Fuck it, we blowin in the wind

[Bridge]
Maybe we win to fight
Maybe our love is drifting in the end
Maybe I hurt your heart
How could your pride convince you not to care?

[Chorus]
So good, how the hell we get so wrong?
So together, how the hell we get so torn?
Fuck it, we throw in the wind or
Fuck it, we blowin in the wind
I ain't never ever felt like this for no one
But if you say it's over there but is it done done?
Fuck it, we throw in the wind or
Fuck it, we blowin in the wind
