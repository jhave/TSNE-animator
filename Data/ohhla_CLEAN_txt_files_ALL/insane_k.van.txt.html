[Intro: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Violent J, Shaggy, Insane Clown Posse, baby what
from New York to L.A
from Chile to Greece
from Uganda to your momma
We gives absolutely no fucks
Motha fucks
Natural born serial slaterers
Mass mothafuckin murderin muderers
Bitch, count to ten and meet your maker

[Verse 1: Violent J]
I'm scary like Michael Jackson up close
I like diggin up dead bodies, Look at me I'm gross
My name's Violent J but you can call me syphillis
Gonorrhea or the clap cause I infected this rap
You wanna know if I could ever kill somebody
Well thats like askin Charlie Manson if he's ever been to jail
I kill family, friends, myself
What, yeah, I'd kill myself if I could only survive
I tried to kill Rob Van Winkle, in fact thats how we met
I went up to kill him and he was thinkin the same shit
I pulled out a chainsaw, he pulled out and ax
I was like come-on, wait is that a stanley, Where'd you get that?
It's natural and to murder, you gotta have it in you
It's like a dick all up in you, although I wouldn't now
Look at us natural killas
The world's most playa hated rapper
And the most hated group together like whooo!

[Chorus]
Mass murders
Natural born killas
I'm not fuckin around
Icky icky ya ya
Icky icky ya ya

[Chorus] - repeat

[Verse 2: Vanilla Ice]
This ain't no Blair Witch, Beware bitch
I'll pick your motherfuckin brain with an icepick
Remember me? The V I-C-E
Well here's my trilogy, I'm outta captivity
The rap Cujo you know my flow is ferocious
The last survivor with a mouth full of cockroaches
I bring this hocus pocus
You're flying away
Like the last days of the motherfuckin Locust
I'm the redneck in the moshpit, 2 axes come in handy
To answer Violent J, Ya damn right its a Stanley
In the shadows of the dark with Darkman like spawn
In your dash blazin it up with explosive bombs
I spit homicides like major cities at 11PM
Assembling bodies in the dungeon like the line at GM
Ice mixed with blood is the killer's milkshake
Blended with the clowns from the underground it's a lyrical deathbreak

[Chorus] - repeat

[Chorus] - repeat

[Verse 3: La the Darkman]
Disrespect me, I'll run in your house
Like puffin Steve Stout
Break both your arms, gun in your mouth
Knock your teeth out with the nose of the fifth
Bullets bust through the back of your head ya die stiff
Fuckin with tha clan, watch what you say
We kill Niggaz like the KKK
Shoot you with an SK or a AK
Bitch, you gonna die either way
I'm a monster, Thoroughbred, Gun holding weed head
Cross me, Bet tomorrow you'll be dead
Catch you at a show, While you're chilling with your ho
And crack your skull with a bottle of Mo
I'm a Sing Sing killer, Gun room captain
Brooklyn home of the original gun clapping
Gats get brung, Niggaz get done
Sons lose fathers and mothers lose sons
I'm a killer

[Chorus] - repeat

[Chorus] - repeat

[Chorus] - repeat

[Chorus] - repeat</pre>
