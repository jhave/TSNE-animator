Song:   Got This Money
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus]
I got this money baby - I wanna spend it on you
I got this Sunday baby - I wanna spend it with you
We can do what you like - I promise then I'll be true
I got this money baby - I wanna spend it on you; oh

[Childish Gambino]
I don't really know where to go, don't know where to hide
Everywhere that I go, you'll be right by my side
You're the only girl that I have ever dreamed of
I wanna tell you everything but everything just seems dumb

[Bridge]
I kinda like you girl, really wanna dress you up
I wanna buy you for real
I kinda like you girl, really wanna feel you up
I wanna feel you for real

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
I got an upstairs downstairs in my loft
Check the mixtape baby - I don't talk
Yes I run this shit, like it's hard to walk
And you think that I'm dope like a mound of chalk
I'm recession proof - I work to relax hoe
Weird voice catch beef like a lasso
New Fresh Prince, you can chill in my castle
Spit real shit, so I must be an asshole
Right~? Nah
That's why I'm makin out in your car
These blogs are a dude's A&amp;R
Got a big tip for these girls at the bar
But I don't mean money
Ever since the money they just treat me funny
Girls look good she can take green from me
Ain't trickin if you got it, know what I mean buddy?
You've got your yellow sun dress on
I'm tryin to write you the best song
With your Wayfarer shades, you drive me insane
I wanna hold hands, and call you pet names

[Bridge] + [Chorus]</pre>
