[Verse 1 - Yung La]
You got to know your boy futuristic ay
My work can make the J's do the jumpman dance
You got to know this the remix right here
Grand Hustle baby, it's the kings right here
You got to know we gwoppy, pockets extra sloppy
Don't I love my vegetables extra cheese and broccoli
Don't Yung la like to kick it like karate
Don't I be with J-Money serving everybody
Ain't we up in Magic City throwing up the broccoli
Ain't me and Tip taking off like a rocket
Ain't my ain't my ain't my ain't my ain't my  money long
Ain't I ain't I ain't ain't I still putting on

[Chorus]
Ain't I x7
Ain't I smoking strong, ain't I putting on, ain't I rocking yays, ain't my money long
Ain't I x7
Ain't I'm in that ville, ain't I on the pill, ain't I on the hill, ain't I keep it real

[Verse 2 - Young Dro]
Ok my rims so big I'm at the tip top ain't I
Choppers in the trunk will make you do the maccerena
Cool to the flo, yea mother fucker ain't I
All black coupe, I can buy it bitch can't I
Remix, Yung La and T.I, this a banga
Dro be on that thang, you don't hear me trick ain't I
Big Rolles Royces, and I got them nauseous
We be in Ferrari's, the cars with the horses
Ain't I on the pill, riding down hills
Iced 30 below minus the wind chill
Ain't I packing chrome, ain't I going strong
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I got it going on
Young Drooooooooo

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
Ralph Lauren purple label
Ain't I fresh as I can be
Made it through my situation, ain't I blessed as I can be
Ain't I laughing at you haters trying to take a shot at me
They don't know which way to go, I'll make it easy, follow me
Honestly ain't I insane, that's the way it's gotta be
Ain't I so so superfly, boy ain't nobody hot as me
Ain't T.I. all on tv when he wake up and go to sleep
Everywhere the notice me, and for yourself just go and see
My community I'm serving though they hope I don't succeed
Hear me speaking, so intrigued, (ain't he snitching) no indeed
You come with that common flow, your show I have to commandeer
Since I see you cant take over, I'll just have to volunteer
Ain't I your superior, listen here bra you not up here
I'm so so wanted it ain't funny, twice the G that I appear
Rep Bankhead so loud and clear
Gon be gone for bout a year
So Paper Trail you gotta hear
But ain't that Ain't I outta here ayy

[Chorus]</pre>
