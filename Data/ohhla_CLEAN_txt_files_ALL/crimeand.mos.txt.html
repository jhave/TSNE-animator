[Talking]
It was so beautiful. It was almost unfair.
It's cold but it's true. It was so cold it got warm.
Kids out in the schoolyard and playing.
It was nice and calm. It was dangerous.

When the MC's came, live out the name
And to perform 
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane
Before they rocked the don
Now on to the mental pains, spark the brains
Building to be born
?? is on the track
Check em check chicka icka etta UHH

Strange Times
Everybody got their get high (Oh my)
Their get right, their get nice, they get by (Oh my)
They get open, get ready, get primed
The national pastime is victimless crime
You want your thrill and I want mine
As long we can get it we ain't got to say why
I don't mean to pry, you ain't got to lie
We ain't got to speak when it's written in the eyes
Whenever she was high off the sparkle in her palm
She had a young girl's smile and a hustler's charm
Dying from the city where the hustler's are born
Made, traced, murdered, replaced
Life-long residents barely feel safe
And the street's offer plenty taste and little faith (Break it down)
Little face, soft lips, little waist (Break it more)
Tiny hands (Oh god) fat ass (Oh more)
Big eyes like birthday surprise
Super dupa fly, born in 85
Repeat it to yourself: This is a victimless crime
Psyche your mind there's a victim every time
Your tasty little pill, your freaky little thrill
Pray won't leave you still, you wonder how it feel
It's real, pussy like some money that you steal
Eww

When the MC came, fill out the name
And to perform 
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane
Before they rocked the don
Now on to the mental pains, spark the brains
Building to be born
Give the people a new drug

Crime and medicine
Dead wrong and live in America
Off the block and right in your area
Fresh apples and peaches for the president
HA HA
Crime and medicine
Dead wrong and live in your area
From the street corner, right in your residence
Fresh apples and peaches for the president
Crime
Fresh peaches and apples for the president
Crime
Fresh chocolates and apples for the president
Crime
Fresh linens and apples to the president
Crime
Fresh</pre>
