(Jamie Madrox- chorus)
Here I am (I'm right here dog)
(can you see me?)
Well here I am (I'm right here nigga)
(can you see me?)
Here I am (I'm right here bitch)
(can you see me?)
Well here I am (and I'm runnin' with a hatchet)
 
(Jamie Madrox)
Here I am, a lunatic from head to toe
I sleep in cabinets with the dead but don't let nobody know
That I'm not your ordinary average every day type person
We keep it live while y'all niggas be rehearsin'
Cursin' us, hopin' that we dissapear
But we been in the game for so many many years
That we never gon' stop, and we never gon' fade
Twiztid in this bitch with the Juggalo serenade
Vampire, serial killa, with an axe,
I'm a maniac, scarin' niggas straight into a heart attack
Life is like a relapse, can you see that?
My name is Jamie Madrox, represented by the bat
Dark Knight, dark skies, milk white eyes
People of the sunlight better be advised
There's a new breed of killa on the streets today
Here I am, I'm a maniac, what you say?

(Blaze Ya Dead Homie- chorus)
Here I am (I'm right here dog)
(can you see me?)
Yo here I am (I'm right here nigga)
(can you see me?)
Here I am (I'm right here bitch)
Yo here I am (and I'm runnin' with a hatchet)

(Blaze Ya Dead Homie)
Where my dead thugs? Who jack fools and slang drugs
And call each other ???
Who ain't afraid to ride through the hood with a piece on they lap
I'm just a killa bitch, you don't want a nigga autograph
Ice-cold like a 40 oz
only thugs and killas be the ones down to ride with me
Where my killas at? Shootin' up right back
And all you bitch muthafuckas you can get the nutsack
Things change in the hood fast, can't think slow
Stay away from the busta-ass bitches and hoes
And for the 50, give me the slugs and the rifle
I turn the pig into a sloppy joe
No bitch in blue gonna tell me shit
I hope ya badge can protect ya from the shotgun, nig
From the cradle to the grave and the end of time
I hold it down, ask me where I'm at, nigga you know the time

(Monoxide Child- chorus)
Here I am (I'm right here dog)
(can you see me?)
Here I am (I'm right here nigga)
(can you see me?)
Here I am (I'm right here bitch)
(can you see me?)
Here I am (and I'm runnin' with a hatchet)

(Monoxide Child)
I rock the wicked wit' my nigga big Blaze and Madrox
You can try to shake my gates and can't fade my padlocks
You see me represent my hood and my homies for mad blocks
Here to slide at all you fake-ass Biggies and 2Pacs
2 blocks, it ain't enough you better hit the streets hard
And pray that I don't catch you and find you a graveyard
I'm a psycho thug, fuck ya iced-out mug
I spent my money on a casket and some fat-ass buds
I slip ya girl a little drug and now she sleepin' with me
And when she finally came around the bitch called the police
I'm a Generation-X reject from '85
With a pack of 'Ports, a fresh-ass mullet and 9 lives
I'm disguised and disgustin, don't get yo shit busted
And that one bitch that I trusted, I bucked her with my musket
Am I really hard to find? Well here I am
Count ya like the spirits and ouijis from other lands

(Blaze and Monoxide)
Here I am (I'm right here dog)
(can you see me?)
Here I am (I'm right here dog)
(can you see me?)
Here I am (I'm right here dog)
(can you see me?)
Here I am (and I'm runnin' with a hatchet)</pre>
