Shit god damn motherfucker I'm back
My name aint Jack Tripper, but I'm a day tripper
So watch me whip another funky rhyme
Black hoes sayin that honky's fine
Gettin mine, just like I'm supposed to
And if you fuck with the Rock, I'll roast you
A little toast to the real MC's
Aint no love for the wannabe's
So, hey ho dont call me Joe
Cause the Joe's I know, cant even flow
I can battle rap, and all that other crap
So if ya don't want none, better step to the back
I'm from the motherfuckin old school
Basement party's in the Clem fool
Talkin that trash, I wish you would
Come step to Rock, it's all good

Ya keep on
Rock the house
Rock...rock the house
Ya keep on
Rock the house
Rock...rock the house
Rock...rock the house
Rock...rock the house

Now it's the Marlboro smokin, fine hoe pokin
Kind bud, be the bud's I'm tokin
Hittin you straight with the fresh shit
Mid western funk, and I'm the best bitch
The K to the I to the chrome D's
In the Grand Marquees sippin O-E
Pimpin Rock, it's my name, my game
Servin you hoe's like it ain't no thang
I'm a kid when I rap, rock when I'm singin
I dont care who comes, but what the fuck you bringin
Shit, one time, one rhyme
Cause I'm, that motherfuckin ill one, with a steel dick
Hittin you hoe's with the real shit
Ya keep on
Rock the house
Rock...rock the house
Ya keep on
Ya keep
Rock...rock the house
Rock...rock the house
Ya Keep On
Rock...rock the house
Rock...rock the house

Now if you dont know hoe, I'm the man in the dark
I got more riffs than Stanley Clark
Or George Duke, shoot, I'm the kid with the funky loot
So if ya want some, get some
If ya need some, here's some
If ya don't, just step to the rear son
Cause I'm commin with the quickness
If you dis this bitch, you'll wind up on my hit list
I'll put a bounty on your head
McCough County bitch, aint a good place to wind up dead
Cause i'm a real relavent, elevent, type menace
But it ain't Rocky Dennis
Watch me bend this rhyme in half
I'm like Moses, with the mic is my staff
Layin down them 10 comandments
Thow shall not dis the Rock god damnit

Rock the house
Rock...rock the house
Ya keep on
Ya keep on
Rock the house
Rock...rock the house
Ya keep on
Rock...rock the house
Rock...rock the house
You keep
Rock the house
Stop it's a party
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock the house
Ya keep on
Rock the house
Rock...rock the house
Ya keep on
Jam...uh...jam
Ya keep on
Rock the house
Rock...rock the house
Ya keep on
Rock...rock the house
Rock...rock the house
You keep</pre>
