(chorus)
She's a dirty birdie, she's so flirty
Coming out the house looking all nice and purty
She's a whirly girly, she don't get up early
She like to sleep late and party like LaVerne and Shirley
(repeat)

There she goes, she's a freaky-deaky, thicky-mickey
She kinky, she stinky and she take the winky-dinky
She dingy and janky and she love the hanky-panky
She fucky sucky shucky ducky, screaming "Spank me!"
She itchy scratchy oochie coochie, Gucci luchi
She tooty fruity with the booty and she love sushi
Now who's she? Now who's she?

(chorus 2x)

There she goes at the clubby-clubby, rubby-dubby
Drinky-drinky bubbly-bubbly
Lovey-dovey in the cutty with the buddy-buddy, chubby-chubby
No they ain't fuddy-duddy, they like putty
Like to say "Daddy-daddy!" and blaze fatties
Make you go baddie-baddie for the meat patty
She like it real juicy-juicy and she loosey-goosey
You know she like Acey-Deucy and she work the poo-sy
Now who's she? Now who's she?

(chorus 2x)

There she goes, sweet honey-bunny she yummy-yummy
Always screaming "Money-money!" like it ain't funny
Put it in her tummy-tummy, she cummy-cummy
Yes she's a mommy-mommy but still stunning
Rum with the Coka-Cola, she like nola [?]
Talking on the Motorola, outta controlla
Make a homie happy-happy for the nappy-nappy
She said "I know it's sloppy, papi, but get at me"
Who dat be? Who dat be?

(chorus 2x)

There she goes she's big and pretty with the titties
Next to miss itty-bitty with the fat kitty
She like it bang-bang chitty, nitty-gritty
Dancing to "Doo Wah Ditty" in the city
Big booga wooga sugar, she my nigga
She don't stop get it get it, and I dig her
Now who is her? Now who is her?

(chorus 2x)

Girls the girls they love me
Girls the girls they love me</pre>
