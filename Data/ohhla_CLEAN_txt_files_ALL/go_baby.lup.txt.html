Where my ladies at?
I said where my ladies at?
Let's find somewhere we can go crazy at
And for you baby I'll be your maniac
Hey hey hey hey
And you don't have to worry 'bout nothing
Cuz everytime I see you baby you'll be rolling with me
Oh i'll be on the sidelines rooting for my dime
Holding up my sign and it say 

Go baby! (Hoo hoo) [x16]

There my lady at
I said there my lady at
That's my honey if I give her money she ain't gotta pay me back
No you ain't gotta pay me back
Hey hey hey hey
And I'll forever give you my love cuz
When I'm down you always put a smile on me
And when all of my strength's up, and I'm 'bout to give up
And I need a lift up, I hear her say

Go baby! (Hoo hoo) [x16]

She loves me, she loves me more
Amour me, she assures
She adores me
Even when it's up and down like see-saw
Surely, we can start from scratch like default
When they say you're not my baby like Maury
You can tell 'em that they're telling a story
Testify like you're telling a jury
And I'll repeat like you said it before me
We undefeated like a veteran army
And we as heavy as an elephant, aren't we?
Let's take 'em to the zoo, or better yet a safari
They want me to leave my Dame like the fella from Marcy (No!)
But we go way back like a set of Atari's
From baby fat 'til we skeletons darling
"Me" starring "You" is what it says on the marquee
So let's go give them a show, on my heart, get set, go!

Go baby! (Hoo hoo) [x16]

And you're my sure-fire, superstar, sure-shot, firecracker
extravaganza, fantastic, super-size with extra cheese
You best believe
That you're my sure-fire, superstar, sure-shot, firecracker
extravaganza, fantastic, super-size with extra cheese
Yes indeed!

Where my ladies at?
I said where my ladies at?
Let's find somewhere we can go crazy at
And for you baby I'll be your maniac
Hey hey hey hey
And you don't have to worry 'bout nothing
Cuz everytime I see you baby you'll be rolling with me
Oh i'll be on the sidelines rooting for my dime
Holding up my sign and it say 

Go baby! (Hoo hoo) [x16]</pre>
