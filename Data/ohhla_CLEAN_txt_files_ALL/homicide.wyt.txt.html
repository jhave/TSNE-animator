[Lil' Wyte]
Man I'm about to kill me a motherfucker
Any kind of motherfucker
Step into my face brotha
Bet this gang's gon' spray brotha
Laughing at the sight of ignorance I wanna see you fall
You the one that knocked me off when I was tryin to climb the wall
But that's all good, that's alright
I'm gon' keep on shining bright
You but devils in my path and in my path I'm seeing light
So fuck you ho, talkin loud
In the center of the crowd
I fucked up I know it that's my shit just sit the fuck on down
Actin bad, coulda been smacked
At least I didn't do all that
I just snatched my shit up, got the fuck up with out looking back
Called her up, bitch you wild
Yes I'm gonna see my child
You try to take that privilege away and you will never smile
Issues packin lackin yes Lil' Wyte be constantly smokin 'dro
When you see me greenery be all up in ci-ga-ri-llo
Ghetty green, that's my thang
Keep the skull around my brain
If it wasn't here I'd either be dead or I would be too plain

[Chorus]
Homicidal
Suicidal
Every day I live my life
Going crazy
In a daisy
Walk around real late at night
You guessin
I'm stressin
People wonder why I'm always high
You testin
Smith and Wesson
You the next on the list to die

[Lil' Wyte]
So you say you krunker than me motherfucker
Bucker than me motherfucker
Tougher than me motherfucker
Rougher than me motherfucker
Got news for ya
Not just for ya
Hope that you like gravity
This ones for ya
Will destroy ya
And will cause some casualties
Limp conditions how I'm livin if you wanna take a peak
Since you want her boy to be my dawg then get the fuck from me
What about her?  What about you?
What about me?  Well fuck you too
If you want to live my life you can but you a fuckin fool
Time was lost, yes it was
So I kept a fuckin buzz
Why you keep a buzz dawg?
Please to keep from fucking up
Life is short then we die
Some don't get a piece of pie
But I'm gonna get my slice even if I have to compromise
Stackin cheese is for me
Even if it's in these streets
Yes I said the streets because I have not reached the industry
But it's all gravy baby
I'm gonna make it off my crazy ways
Different ladies baby
Now I'm crazy that's the way I'll stay

[Chorus]</pre>
