[Crooked Eye]
Bullets rain as we killers post it up and took aim
Sellin dope, low and high, didn't notice he came
We was all strapped slippin, didn't see he was there
By the time I realized, bullets was hittin the air
Just then my nigga whole neck got hit
Saw he dropped and I knew we was in some gangsta shit
He was professional, see my nigga kept on his vest
Word was the killer was paid to put him to rest
Bustin rounds, bustin back, tryin to empty the clip
Tryin to move fast to save him, I knew he was hit
Everybody at the scene who swore they was hard
Had a strap deemin to bust, or squeeze out a far

[Billy Bavgate]
Ten figure niggas whippin gats and bezzles
Bavgate still ridin like a rebel
Bitches wasn't ready when the drama came
Or Bavgate down to die for the Mama mayn
I'm still heavy in the game, I'm the king of the Oak
It's still the same cause the rap game is like the dope game
I'm smokin a taylor, strapped down with my kaylor
I walked up and dumped on the haters, you suckas can't fade us
They mad cause we famous, money didn't change us
Ghost Town, 7th ward, we armed and dangerous
I'm thugged out with one in the chamber
If you disrespect No Limit I'm a bang ya

[Crooked Eye]
Chorus
Now tell me
Nigga would you ride or run
Would you crack under pressure when that drama come
(Drama)
Tell me would you live or die
When them choppers start to split and that hot shit fly
(Drama) x2

[Mia X]
Motherfuckers aint never gotta ask if I ride or run
I'm Mia X, alias biggest mama two guns
I done everything under the sun, been through it
I'm TRU to it, fuck who it gotta be
When the drama's goin down and I'm slightly affiliated
Bitches gotta get eliminated off top
When pressure drops I remain a hard knock
Bitch from off the block where everybody got they shit cocked
I rock that icy shit and roll with cut throats
Ghetto wise guys, Billy Bav and Crooked Eyes
Got to be a sad song blastin shit
For that No Limit click mama smashin shit

[Big Ed]
When drama came she sat beside me so I said fuck it
Whispered murder murder in my ear so I jumped in the bucket
Drama had a street sweeper and choppers and split em
Then she passed me them things and said let's get em (uh oh, ohhh)
Is all you hear nigga before I click clackin
Drama passed me the A-R with the full metal jacket
Kick the door off the brackets, drama took me in
Niggas know when I'm comin they see my dogs, ???
Drama taught me how to kill a nigga with fear
Bitch niggas shouldn't be here (Uh oh, ohhh)
Soldiers at war get the gats and bust
Big Ed brought the drama and in drama I trust
