Within 2000 years Christ shall return
And when I return I goin' to be king of kings
This one, this one, this one, this one

(Krayzie - 2X)
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, my soldier ride

(Chorus)
Revolution in my heart
Oh, they tearin' us apart
We been wastin' so much time
Revolution on my mind
Everyday problems in the world they maximize
Now tell me how much blood must be shed
Oh realize things and times get drastic
A revolution is the only way
Stop this  eternal warfare
Yeah, uhhhh
This one is for the revolution
Roll in a bomb, drop cry
This one is for the revolution
Soldier all positions

(Krayzie)
Wanna talk about revolution?
Should we talk about a revolution, a revolution?
Come on I think it's time, it's already 1999
This is real, we ready for revolution
We sick and we tired, we ready tonight
And we gon' ride, ride, ride, with the warriors
We makin' a push on Babylon the great better hurry up
We doin' it like that combat on contact so the police get bombed
That gunpowder from my gun got my palms black
As we run and we hit up the rest and we chase the police
We done flipped the script, and startin' a riot
We set 'em to fire, to flames, we heat and we hot
Cussin' while they flossin' shots
Marchin' double barrels barkin'
Mark the target ain't for talkin'
Squashin' every enemy walkin' and bomb 'em
We need to suit up in boots
Recruit us some troops to start mashin'
I'm packin' my sawed off and I'm called off, I'm called off

(Chorus)
Revolution in my mind
We been wastin' so much time
Revolution in my heart
The been tearin' us apart
Everyday problems in the world they maximize
And tell me how much blood must be shed
Oh realize things and times get drastic
A revolution is the only way
Stop this eternal eternal warfare
Yeah
This one is for the revolution
Soldier, all positions
This one is for the revolution
Green Beret cover formation
This one is for the revolution
Roll in a bomb, drop cry
I'll bomb down that institution

(Krayzie - 3X)
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, my soldiers ride</pre>
