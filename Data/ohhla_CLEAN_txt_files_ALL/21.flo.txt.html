[Chorus]
She just turned 21
Now she's all up in the club having hell of fun
She says she wanna rock all night
Go ready and give her some
Go ready and get a chunk

Shawty about to shut it down
Down, down, down!
Comes in the air, we can't put them down, down, down
We've got the pricks
It's going down, down, down!
Oh man, she looks like she's ready now
Yes man, let's shut it down!

Yeah, shut it down like gambling
Black Jack, show the bet, show her all the scheme
Go in there, she tellin about bring her friends
coming back like what's that happening?
In the morning, I'm patronin
Half the bottle cause she's probably a woman
Drunk up, feel better in the morning
Drank up, ran out like oh, oh, oh
Don't want the club to get closed
Around like mile 24
When she came to the door
the mama nigga like lets go
what happens in the spot tonight they won't know
The birthday girl is out of control
Kiss my world, I'll jump for sure
Cause she's 21 years old

[Chorus]
She just turned 21
Now she's all up in the club having hell of fun
She says she wanna rock all night
Go ready and give her some
Go ready and get a chunk

Shawty about to shut it down
Down, down, down!
Comes in the air, we can't put them down, down, down
We've got the pricks
It's going down, down, down!
Oh man, she looks like she's ready now
Yes man, let's shut it down!

O.K., you know that what happens at the 21st B-Day
Stays at the 21st B-Day
Gotta go hard, you don't wanna take it easy
Shut it down, get a [?] from the D.J
One drop on the birthday girl

The beat 21 is over!
Do you [?]
Real talk in the [?]
The momma don't [?] like it's all about her
She don't see nobody like it all,its a blur
151 the caughty got nerd
shots on
In the club telephone don't stop
Show her love, how to stay in the spot
Show [?]

[Chorus]
She just turned 21
Now she's all up in the club having hell of fun
She says she wanna rock all night
Go ready and give her some
Go ready and get a chunk

Shawty about to shut it down
Down, down, down!
Comes in the air, we can't put them down, down, down
We've got the pricks
It's going down, down, down!
Oh man, she looks like she's ready now
Yes man, let's shut it down!

I'm spending money tonight
Give you the time of your life
The after party is back at my house, my house!
I've got a present for you
It's waiting up in my room
But I wanna give it to you right now, right now!
Who wants another round?
We're about to take them down
I'm staying back [?]
How you're shaking that [?]
She's turning 21, the night has just begun
We gonna be living in a [?]

[Chorus]
She just turned 21
Now she's all up in the club having hell of fun
She says she wanna rock all night
Go ready and give her some
Go ready and get a chunk

Shawty about to shut it down
Down, down, down!
Comes in the air, we can't put them down, down, down
We've got the pricks
It's going down, down, down!
Oh man, she looks like she's ready now
Yes man, let's shut it down!</pre>
