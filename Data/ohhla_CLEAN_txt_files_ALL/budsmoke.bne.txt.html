[WISH BONE]
Some niggas be passin' that weed on
To them thugsta niggas from Cleve-lawn
Gotta smoke 'til it's all gone
Now what a BONE cuz a nigga be creep on
Call all my thugstas, all them niggas drink
Call all my thugstas, all them niggas smoke weed

[KRAYZIE BONE]
Gotta get some hydro
Gotta toke like a loc with a little bit of smoke in my throat
Can't let a me high go
I'ma broke Mo Thug got the bud and it get up up on me...inhale
Just split up a blunt and me roll up a fat one, make it POD'ed
They lable me killa, drug dealer and burn up nigga crazy weed and...

[LAYZIE BONE]
Blaze up a blunt, gotta have that hydro
Need me a hit of the tweed, make me drop to my knees
And I gotta give love to the green leaves
Steadily spendin' that cheese, feelin' at ease
Thuggin' on off in the cut now, when I'm checkin' on how this shit sound
In the Range smoked out with my nigga Tay
Smokin' that tweed 'til we fall in the grave

[BIZZY BONE]
Make up the dummy to make up me money, weed run me
And headed for broke, smokin' the bong
Hit that bong wrong, make a me cough and choke
To the real OT's loc strong BONE
I gotta C note to toke on, so choke on
And holdin' the smoke 'til it's gone, real long and stay blown

[KRAYZIE] (overlapping)
Wanna get you fucked up, wanna get you fucked up
(Haaay nooow)
Wanna get you fucked up, wanna get you fucked up
(Pass me some reefer)
Wanna get you fucked up, wanna get you fucked up
(Haaay nooow)
Wanna get you fucked up, wanna get you fucked up
(Pass me some reefer)

[WISH BONE]
It's the inventor of the green leaves, gotta get p's
Cuz I love this type shit, and it's never gonna quit 
Doctor told me better stop but man fuck that bitch
Me never gone stop me smoke 
Try to tell me, K to your throat
Gosta run me on, fucking with BONE
Loving this weed smoke

[KRAYZIE BONE]
Thuggin' with me trues, swiggin' on brews
Steadily losing me balance
Take a puff to the dome, trippin' on FLESH BONE
Showin' off me tal-ent
Smokin' 'til a me die, nigga gotta get high if he wanna come ride
Come with me smoke on a blunt and get nice
Nigga tellin' weed fiends it's fiiiyiiiire

[LAYZIE BONE]
Feelin' on tilt man, quarter o to the brain
Smokin' like blunt after blunt my niggas insane
Other niggas can't hang, it's a BONE thing
How a nigga like me smoke and maintain and remain
Number one here I come with the tweed in my chest 
Nigga got his weed to the curb, split up and serve
But fuck it gotta have them green herbs

[BIZZY BONE]
You got a bag of tweed well blaze it with me fool
And don't be stingy and please no pinners make it swollen
Cuz if I had me some weed you know I'd smoke it with you
Come come get with a me, me and my niggas blunts be rollin'

Budsmokers Only, Budsmokers Only...Onlaaaaaay X6
