Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I've seen a lot things in life that words can't explain
See we ain't any different but we just ain't the same
They never listen when we tell 'em, tell 'em
All they understand is venom, venom
People only use you when you let 'em, let 'em
Well if that's the case then I'm the one to blame

Cause there's a man over board
And the tides gonna drag him down
If there's a man in the clouds
Then tell me where the hell is he now
Why is the silence so loud
Have I thrown it all away
Lemme know, Lemme know
Tell me is that what happens just for having a good intention, tension ohh ohh
Look what happened to my Good Intention, tension ohh ohh
Why won't anybody answer my question
Why is the silence so loud
I think I've thrown it all away
I don't know, I don't know
But lemme know
Hear me out before you label me the bad one

Ahhhhhhahhhhhhhh

I'm walking through the desert but I'm drowning inside
No river runs deeper than the tear from my eye
You only went and made me bitter, bitter
I wish I wasn't such a giver, giver
Apologise to my liver, liver
Cause if that's the case then you're the one to blame

Cause there's a man over board (cause there's a man overboard)
And the tides gonna drag him down (heyy)
If there's a man in the clouds (whoa whoa)
Then tell me where the hell is he now (yeah)
Why is the silence so loud (tell me why is it so loud)
Have I thrown it all away (yeah)
Lemme know, Lemme know
Tell me is that what happens just for having a good intention, tension ohh ohh
Look what happened to my Good Intention, tension ohh ohh
Why won't anybody answer my question
Why is the silence so loud
I think I've thrown it all away
I don't know, I don't know
But lemme know
Hear me out before you label me the bad one

Am I wrong to think the worlds got it in for me
And am I right to say I'm longing for some sympathy
See I feel a sound, but I can't hear it
That's my heart strings getting played like a symphony
Yo, you know you turned me insane
Why you staring at window when I'm the one with the pain
You know you set me off the rails
And you'll be to blame
If you ever hear
I jumped in front of the train we're both fucked in the brain
(whoa whoa)

Cause there's a man over board
And the tides gonna drag him down
If there's a man in the clouds
Then tell me where the hell is he now
Why is the silence so loud (tell me why is it so loud)
Have I thrown it all away
Lemme know, Lemme know
Tell me is that what happens just for having a good intention, tension ohh ohh
Look what happened to my Good Intention, tension ohh ohh
Why won't anybody answer my question
Why is the silence so loud (tell me why is it so loud)
I think I've thrown it all away
I don't know, I don't know
But lemme know
Hear me out before you label me the bad one

Why is the silence so loud
I think I've thrown it all away
I don't know, I don't know
But lemme know
Hear me out before you label me the bad one</pre>
