[Chorus 4X]
Work dat pussy, work dat pussy
All my bitches work dat pussy
Work dat pussy, work dat pussy, all my bitches

[Kurupt]
Pussy makes the world go 'round, knock that pussy up and down
Get your money, get your cash, in and out, slow and fast
(Fuck em right) Fuck em Daz, work that pussy, slap that ass (Oh)
Put my dick right in her mouth, suck till all the nut come ouuutttt

[Daz]
This is what you need for hoes to get ill (ill)
Move it in and out and give em what you will
All the hoes actin moody, stick my dick up in her coochie
If that hole get played out, stick my dick up in her booty
Know em that, give em that, know em this, show em that
If the hoe wanna do me then the hoe know where I'm at
