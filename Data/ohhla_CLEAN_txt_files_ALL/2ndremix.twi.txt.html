[Jamie Madrox]
I represent the Eastside, no peace, fuck the police
We tell you to increase the deceased at least
A grown man tellin' you something that he believe
Practice to deceive, no more tricks up my sleeve
What the fuck bitch, chuck bitch, why you talkin' shit
Better duck bitch before your dome get hit
This shit is twisted, deeper than that old French braid
Stickier than jam and jelly phased, kick it

[Monoxide]
Everybody else real talkin' bout somethin'
What you thought you heard bitch, can it cause you're frontin'
Dead wrong, dinner table conversations
Leavin' you pistol whipped in the corner with abrasions
Call it a contamination of mind state
Sleep in a dream, hopin' it's gone when I awake
Mama think I'm a play on play serial killer
Fruit looped outta my mind like Godzilla
We survive like caterpillars in cocoons and caskets
Stretch the industry like elastic, so fantastic
Like the Newport cigarette that I smoke
Hit the motherfucker till I choke, I brag and boast
About nothin', death, dyin' and ho's fuckin'
So understand that he's sayin' somethin'
Never be heard, I'm underground with the dirt and grime
Smashin' heads be my reason for rhyme, I'm on time
Like a motherfucker leavin' you hangin' in the forest
Standin' in some comfortable shifts like Chuck Norris
Take the chorus, second hand smoke when you breathe
Remember what I told you, always believe
You relieve on the Monoxide Child and wild
Travel the world on nine cloud, screaming loud

Free your mind
Breathe it in, second hand smoke
Free your mind
Breathe it in, second hand smoke

You phoney bitches wanna shut me down, pullin' plugs on the microphones
Hatin' on the individual handle Mr. Bones
Hope your speaker's eight ohms or they dead blown
If they aren't, turn this motherfucker up and mash on
As we blast off bitch ass niggaz at fast rate
Growin' at a fast pace, made my heart race
Lookin' death in the face and I don't even shudder
If my woman starts cheatin', motherfuck her
Bitch I'm out for self, green weed, fame and wealth
So take your hopes and dreams and put that shit back on the shelf
Cause we rollin' in a ride far from stolen
Cigarette lighters, power windows, wood grade motors
And takin' curbs with ease, blowin' trees
Lookin' Chinese, hopin' that the cops ain't tailin' me
Tryin' to violate that glass house
Nigga pass the blunt before you pass out
Cause now it's on, pushin' hubcaps, patrollin' the hood so fuck that
Heard the shit and this shit is all wack, plannin' the attack
Cause we move when it's dark at night
Believe the rumors cause they probably all right
Outta sight like concealed weapons and drug trades
Barricading your door for the raid, and in the shade
Is a sawed off, double-barrelled pump
Lookin' for motherfuckers who wanna jump
Cause I got thirteen bullets in my pocket, I'm a mad man
My trigger finger turnin' suckers to sand

Free your mind
Breathe it in, second hand smoke
Free your mind
Breathe it in, second hand smoke

All distraught from head trauma, you can't even see the drama
I get the persona from marijuana
At night I lay stressed with no place to go
All by my lonely, screamin' out fuck that show
Cigarettes, blunt smoke, I love the smell
Player hate me cause I smoke, burn in hell
This shit ain't for everybody, I love to sever bodies
So melancholy, suicide is just a folly and I'm out

Free your mind
Breathe it in, second hand smoke
Free your mind
Breathe it in, second hand smoke

Free your mind
Breathe it in, second hand smoke
Free your mind
Breathe it in, second hand smoke

Free your mind
Breathe it in, second hand smoke
Free your mind
Breathe it in, second hand smoke

Free your mind
Breathe it in, second hand smoke
Free your mind
Breathe it in, second hand smoke</pre>
