"Dayaam, look at baby's hair over there and shit!
 Damn big 1970's Jackson's afro and shit!"

[Boots]
Damn... motherfuckers, always bein like that
Apply three drips, rub softly with your fingertips
And even though you flipped, don't trip cause now you're, hip
And now you slick it, you grease it and you lick it
and you're lookin really wicked but your hair is now called good
You moisturize and texturize and relax-ize and civilize it
but yo I got a 'fro, so a bro's misunderstood
Kitchen in the back, give me dap I got a knapsack
Knick knack Patty's wack, cause in her mind it's firm
that straight is in and out is black
cause black went out with tenament shacks
but beauty is a natural fact so I say, "Fuck a perm!"</pre>
