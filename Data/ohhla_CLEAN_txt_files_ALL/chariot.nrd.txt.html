[Intro - Pharrell singing with no beat]
Sorry that we took so long
You probably thought we forgot your song
It makes us smile just so you know
To see your eyes at our shows

[Verse - Pharrell sings when beat starts]
I wrote this song while I was drunk
I hope you don't mind that it was wine
But you called me and said you didn't want your friends to know
But what if you had to go
What about then
What about then Mildred
Excuse me I mean music
What about then

[Chorus - Pharrell]
Sweet chariot of fire
Gon' swing us all the way
Sing us a song today
Awayay, awayay awayay, awayay awayay, awayay awayay

Or maybe I'm in your car just driving away
And everything's ok

[Verse  Pharrell]
Float around where there's no need to walk
And there's nothing but thoughts and feeling no talk
Where there's golden bees and silver birds
And dreams are like shootin come true and heard
And every moment feels like a spin Mildred
I mean, a spin music
So what about then

[Chorus]

Or maybe I'm in your car just driving away
And everything's ok

[Verse - Pharrell]
Where every star flickers bright as sister
Just for the whisper commands your love
 The bright sun in the sky all the flowers harmonize
And that's where your starry eyes will stand above

[Pharrell talking]
(Mildred x 6)
The fuck I mean Mildred
How the fuck you gonna tell me it's Mildred (I'm sorry) and not music
(Music)
Fuck it

[Chorus]

Or maybe I'm in your car just driving away
And everything's ok</pre>
