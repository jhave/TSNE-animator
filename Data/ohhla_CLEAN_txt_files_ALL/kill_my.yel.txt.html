Happy Friday The 13th
Muthafuckers

Go to sleep little boy don't cry
Like shadows on the wall
Don't look under your bed
Hear footsteps in the hall
Somebody's gonna come get me
And take me to the woods in the fall
Don't look under your bed
Crucifix on the wall
Could it be in my mind
My time has gone by
Slayed in the field, left here to die
What if momma finds me like this
Wonder this dirts still alive
I don't know how to resist
All of these thoughts that are running through my little mind
Trouble on the show, scared for my life
Still I want war

In a world that could feel like a fucking cage
I just sit in silence
Instead of tryna to escape I became crazy and started smiling
Took a knife to the back when I turned around I held somebody close
But I bled just enough to live, half man, half ghost
And the dream is dark, fuck it, into the dark I go
You want me to be a monster and kill em?
You want me to be the one with the blade?
You want me to stand up and scream
You begged for me to go into a rage
Well, hand me the machete then right now
I'll walk into the house and lay 'em down
Bring you the head of every victim man, woman, child
I will not deceive you
God said I'll never leave you
And since I can't see you
Then I'll have to believe you
Yeah I've got a dream and I've seen many many nightmares unfold
But fear has no hold, on this dream that I control
I control
I control
I control

Goodbye nightmares
Bye bye nightmares
Goodbye nightmares
Kill my nightmare</pre>
