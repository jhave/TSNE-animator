[Q-Tip]
Shocka called me up to do this thing for Soundbombing
And I figured that I'd do it cause it wasn't no harmin'
Shine a little bit in case somebody was forgettin'
About that Queens motherfucker, y'all need to take cover
I'ma take position and y'all best to take sha-hida
Cause the shit that I spit is hot as hellfire, hotter
Sendin' this to Cross, Meniski, and Bay Vigi
Doug, Pretty Tone and the one that shoot the vidi
Y'all stay in my heart, while I dabble with the charts
Fuck the fame and my aim find the clarity in art
This cowards got it once cause he kept his lips zippin'
Now he in the news and he wettin' and I'm livin'
This Southern cowards life who I used to do my clues with
Subliminally this is me, I try not to assume shit
Let's not forget the king of Internet
Will assume another name while he tarnishes ya rep
And calls you Ziggy Starters but who the major charm
Who starts to elevate out the reach of his arm

[Q-Tip]
It's a great day fuck it
Ya probably hear the bundles overflowin' out of Ruckers
The name is Abstract don't confuse without description
Cause you lil' gremlins envy so just cut the fuckin' weak shit
Ride off in the night, V8 lost power
From a soundbomb killin' the lone ranger drillin'
You eager with ya mouth then just be a big proactive
Ya actin' with ya heart then start preachin' with ya fatness
The clear voyage psychic MC is a minion
You cornered and you bagged in so where you gon' run to
Used to get my mother's switches now I grant her wishes
Never superstitious breakin' mirrors with the pitches
Ya man is insane with that do-do on his chain
Funkin' up the joint he pain, that ain't a bling that's a blang
Besides can he rap about a real life vision
Success lies a struggle that's what most of y'all are missin'
Got so many sons I wish I had as many ones
Clown nigga's raps get converted into guns
Illuminati president it's a government official
They dogs and they henchmen is comin' out to get you
The age of Aquarius, the change is goin' on
We gotta keep strivin' movin' on

Ya dead wrong, ya wrong, ya know ya wrong
(Ya know ya wrong for that)
(Now why ya gotta go and do that)
Ya dead wrong, ya wrong, ya know ya wrong
And you know, you know you are ooh
And you know, you know you are</pre>
