This joint right here
It goes out for the fellas
Creepin in the lady's home when they man ain't home
Ladies help me say

[Chorus]

If you ain't treatin your girlfriend right
Trust me when I tell you this
One day you won't be missed
Someone will replace your kiss
You wanna be hardcore
Like the rapper Jadakiss
Or a thug like me will be up in your house
Cookin breakfast in the morning
I know you heard these words before
But you never heard em quite like this
You gon find yourself livin all by yourself
Who woulda ever thought wit a stranger she would share her wealth
Now a stranger like me is lyin under her sheets
This is a warning red alert emergency
If you can't find your girl that means she's here wit me
She said you had an argument
So I brought her roses
You know what comes next when the door closes
You don't like her smile
So you treat her foul
You only give her attention when I'm on the prowl
And now your guilty conscience got you actin wild
And now you wanna flip mode like you Busta Rhymes

[Chorus]

This is a warning red alert emergency
If you can't find your girl she's at work wit me
Yo we eatin brunch while you havin lunch
You don't even call to see what she wants
You don't like her smile so you treat her foul
You only give her attention when I'm on the prowl
And now your guilty conscience got you actin wild
And now you wanna flip like you Busta Rhymes

[Chorus]

This is a warning
It's a radar warning
My dogs I'm talking to you right now
You need to hold her and console her
Never, never, never be afraid to tell her that you love her

[Chorus]

Get on the phone and call your girlfriend right now
You shoulda listened to her
Shoulda listened to her
You shoulda listened to her
Shoulda listened to her
Oh, you should listen to her
Sometimes you should listen to her
Take her out for dinner
Shoulda listened to her
Take her to the movies
Shoulda listened to her
She lookin groovy
Shoulda listened to her
That kinda girl ready
Shoulda listened to her
Yo you should listen to her
Shoulda listened to her
Sometimes just listen to her
Shoulda listened to her
Listen to her
Shoulda listened to her
Sometimes just listen to her
Shoulda listened to her</pre>
