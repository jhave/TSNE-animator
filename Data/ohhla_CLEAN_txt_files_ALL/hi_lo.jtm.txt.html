Verse 1:

I only drop the hotness
Don't see haters cause them suckers can't top this
Ain't nobody in da game who can stop this
When it come to wicked flow's you know I got this
Every time I drop this
I come like an erect dick, ready to waste shit
You see them killers with me and them suckers jack quick
I put it down, like this shit is too heavy
I let you know I'm coming, you still can't get ready
We blowing pounds
Nigga fuck smoking them nickel bags
We big bossin', all you clowns looking fag

Verse 2:

I turn it off and on like light switches
Taking suckers out the game who ack just like bitches

You see a nigga violating better bust his dick
Got no luv for no snakes and no playa haters
Pushin' these fuck niggas buttons like they elevators
My shit too hot and I'm close to scorching yours
Fucking you up nigga like you at "The Source Awards"
Close shop, nigga don't stop playboy
Suckers swear they got game but I play none
Don't step out yo league into big tyme
Talking 'bout you wanna get mine
Split ya with time, nigga what
Bring the ruckus, taking out these suckers

You niggas scared of war, you don't want it to start
