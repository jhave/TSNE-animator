Uh, ah, da
(Are you ready for this) Err
The Ice Cream Man
(Are you ready for this)
It's bad like my high
(Are you ready for this)
ERRR, my No Limit Soldiers, trademark
Get em' up ugh, show ya domes, T-R-U
We TRU, ugh, ugh
Time to go to war, ugh

[Master P]
I'm posted up on the block, got these killers runnin' you sick of this
And chicken nuts, niggas slangin' with cuts
Ready to bust on you cluckers
On you niggas that sick cause we sicker
Niggas slangin' flickers
I'm in the projects ballin' with my niggas
I'm hustlin' quarters and thirty sacks
Niggas ain't fuckin' with dirty sacks
I'm hustlin' I got those ball sacks
But y'all niggas don't know that
I'm the mad killer, murder, lunatic
You fuckin' with a nigga that don't give a fuck about you
Or your bitch cause I'll go like psycho, ha ha ha
Like Michael, load this fuckin' rifle
Start blastin' at bitches motherfucker, yeah cause I'm a psycho
Out that 3rd ward, Calliope killin' murder
Lunatic, haven't you heard of a nigga not playin' with a full deck
Break ya neck, hustle on ya check
Get cho' get cho' neck broke
Fuckin' field cats and chat
No Limit nigga, real nigga, who
Don't give a fuck when you dead and gone
Motherfucker you feel my bucks from my chrome

[Hook]
UGH! back up off me, feel me ugh
Feel it, back up off me, my trademark
Ugh, feel it back up off me, ugh

[Master P]
Gon' pack me with a nigga with no bread
Nappy head, put chu' in a grave
Don't give a fuck about chu' niggas, piss on ya forehead
I'm from that Southside, we kill with that cut rock
But niggas they slangin' that hoo rock
But niggas they wanna boo dock, that buddha
Nigga a quarter, of water
But y'all niggas late cause I done took over New Orleans
In the Southside to the Westside to the Eastside to the Northside
Motherfuckers never realize the young gon' die on the streets
I'm killin' murder, the lunatic
Never givin' a fuck, I'm tryin' to make bucks
Before I leave this truck
Got these killers watchin' me
Niggas not pockin' me
V got that tech nine and Man got that uzi
Big Boz come with rah rah, niggas with sah sah
KR hooked up the track so what the fuck y'all didn't realize
We back to takin' the battle, scattle not rattle
Get my tic tac and make ya motherfuckin' head rattle
Like an ostrich, nigga you want some sausage
Meet me in the French Quarter
I'm kickin' it with them 3rd ward hustlers
And they bout it, niggas we rowdy
Never givin' a fuck, we started this bout it, bout it
Now why y'all sayin' y'all bout it bout it
Y'all scared of me, yeah y'all scared of me
Bitch talkin' shit, you and ya bitch I ain't afraid of ya
I'm hustlin' got them ballers, niggas we smokin' them quarters
Fiends be dippin' that water but we hustlin' like it ain't no tomorrow

[Hook]

[Master P]
Niggas comin' wicked, fools I'm gon' kick it
Be whippin' niggas ass like I'm cookin' greasy chicken
I'll pop off batter but niggas they wanna scatter
Niggas they talkin' shit, I be runnin' with them 17 round automatics
Up the trees, watch them niggas freeze
Don't give a fuck, take off my shirt nigga
No Limit on my back, back
But niggas they pullin' that sack, sack
TRU against my stomach motherfucker how y'all gonna fade that
The real fuckin' click, ain't no love for y'all dubs
Niggas think we slangin' dubs
Nigga we slangin' tapes to you niggas across the world
Niggas that squirrel, I got that girl
My lil' partner got boy, got the whirl
But I don't give a fuck cause I be sick like Suzy
Take these 32 round clips from my automatic uzi
Run and duck nigga you fried
Ain't no love where I'm from, from the outside to the inside
The projects from uptown to downtown
To across the river
Niggas slangin' that dope motherfucker get cho' head twisted
In the river, you gone, ain't no love meet the chrome
I be in the project ballin' like the black Al Capone
And if you come sick you stupid
Cause my click don't give a fuck cause they ready to shoot shit
Up but nigga you better duck nigga
Before you find your body floatin' up the Mississippi River
