Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[x2]
I turn something to nothing, in the cutless I'm buttless
Don't give a fuck if you pretty
Don't fuck with me less you fucking
If you ain't sucking I'm bucking, be self so cocky, I'm poppin
Will go claw hoppin in London, and if you fine take you shoppin

[Verse 1]
Man I got so much money, I swear my pockets is sloppy
I'm walking foreign designers, where everything is so cocky
My money winnin you jockin
All my hoes for a ride
I bought a Bentley a masterpiece, so the jet boys glockin
Red beam on your head, now you're home boy shot
I got a good one but is steady for every chain I got
And it's the pay with the give the niggas for all the brain I got
I be a multibillionaire, I have to explain this guap, this guap

[Chorus: x2]
Jugg finesse, I'm gone with the set
It don't need callin for your money bet
Jugg finesse, I'm gone with the set
It don't need callin for your money bet

[Verse 2]
I rap, I scheme, press down on jet
I work that triple bean, I'm the man in the trap
I'll show you shit you never seen, you get rich off that
I'm talking million dollar months, you could double your set
Smoke 200$ blunts, every boss that's a stay
Missin with the caviar, while I cook up the crack
3 65 I got a jugg, paper chasing the same
I got all these free bands, don't give a fuck about rep
All we do is jugg, me and Gucci getting it in
10 17, that's a brick with an extra 10
You buy a brick from me a 36 you get a 10
You shouldn't shot with Scooter, he done did that shit again

[Chorus: x2]
Jugg finesse, I'm gone with the set
It don't need callin for your money bet
Jugg finesse, I'm gone with the set
It don't need callin for your money bet</pre>
