[Abstract Rude]
Baby don't cry, dry your eye
This is my house, you get out, why am I outside
As the door closes
Baby I don't want to turn this into a war of the roses
Rock bottom to the lowest, I'm feeling hopeless
I hope you know this, my prayers dare us to stay focused
She don't know what broke is
I grew up in a rough ass part of L.A. where noone wants to live
Give us another chance to advance
Sorry Abby but I got to find another man
Damn, can a Scorpio get stung
Maybe I was young and dumb and full of cum
And Hell has sprung, no never that
Life is too short and you don't get it back
Roger that, she hanging up, I'm calling back
Later on we'll be making up in the sack

She's always right, we fuss and break up
We argue, fight and fuck to make up
Something seems wrong, but she don't say what
And even if she strikes me first I can't touch
You got to love it, though we never get to the bottom of it
It's like dealing with an alcoholic
When we're drunk off love, we just can't call it
And when we smoked off bud, then we'd both frolic
She's always right, we fuss and break up
We argue, fight and fuck to make up

[Moka Only]
I haven't fallen in love in a long time
To busy balling and calling the wrong line
Who was he fooling by doing that everytime
The joke's on you when Moke's on you, recline
I'm so much into me I can't be refined
When you touch me, it really don't blow my mind
If you call me, I ignore it half the time
If I offer you, forget it, it's asinine
I worry about it going to something that ain't be mine
Love is picture perfect but now ain't the time
You blame it on the mammal or you blame it on the sign
And the thing at the end of my tail that prevails
The sting is just a part of my male genital
And it fails to really keep the wind from my scales
Even a perfect ten will end and get steel
I'm the mystery with bad history up for sale
Her misery, no more kissing me, fuck the deal
I feel bad, but bitch's suck for real
Are you serious, nah, I guess I'm just stuck with you
Till I fall off my high horse with a bus to kill

[Abstract Rude]
She's always right, we fuss and break up
We argue, fight and fuck to make up
Something seems wrong, but she don't say what
And even if she strikes me first I can't touch
You got to love it, though we never get to the bottom of it
It's like dealing with an alcoholic
When we're drunk off love, we just can't call it
And when we smoked off bud, then we'd both frolic
She's always right, we fuss and break up
We argue, fight and fuck to make up

[Prevail]
The hardest part of this isn't the arguments
In front of the apartment with the entire neighborhood as the audience
Ignorance makes us both look like idiots
And I can't live with it, so lets figure it out
Before I'm back digging it out tomorrow night
Because ain't no sunlight when we fight
With those thin little rays between love and spite
Advantage, when you take it of me and say you love me
It's slanted, I think you got some problems with honesty
That hoams a little shining beacon of monogomy
If you cheat we both feel the heat
In love, there is no surrender so I run for retreat

You got to love it, though we never get to the bottom of it
It's like dealing with an alcoholic
When we're drunk off love, we just can't call it
And when we smoked off bud, then we'd both frolic
She's always right, we fuss and break up
We argue, fight and fuck to make up</pre>
