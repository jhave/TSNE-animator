[Intro - Pharrell]
It's her dark skin..
It's your juicy lips girl, ah-ahhh

She's bad bad, bad ass (uh)
She's bad bad, bad ass
She's bad bad, bad ass (you're so dark girl)
She's bad bad, bad ass

[Pharrell]
I've been all around the Earth
There no girls that kiss me first
But you just stand there with a smirk
But don't you worry about it, ahh - OWW!!
.. So BABY!! Don't fool wit me
If you don't wanna give it up
Don't worry about it
BABY!! Don't fool wit me
If you don't wanna give it up
Don't worry about it
I just wanna feel your (uhh)
You just wanna feel my (uhh)
We should just go feel our (uhh)
Imagine.. but fuck it don't worry about it
OWW!! BABY! Don't fool wit me
If you don't wanna give it up
Don't worry about it (worry about it)
BABY!!! Don't fool wit me
If you don't wanna give it up
Don't worry about it (worry about it)
Baby look at your girl starin at me
And her girl, in the next seat
They want a menage three, don't worry about it
OWW!! I said BABY!! Don't fool wit me
If you don't wanna give it up
Don't worry about it (worry about it)
Chocolate flower.. uh (worry about it)
See, I know I got them other girls
But I wanna learn from youuuu
There's a war going on outside no man is safe from
And I'm not trying to looossee, I need you
They say, damn Pharrell! you have a cold heart, will you move?
So when it comes to a girl like you, that moves me
What am I supposed to do? .. but admit it
You're you're you're bad ass
You're you're, c'mon sing it wit me

[Chorus]
She's bad bad, bad ass (uh)
She's bad bad, bad ass (girl you know you just a)
She's bad bad, bad ass (uh)
She's bad bad, bad ass (just)
She's bad bad, bad ass (I said she's)
She's bad bad, bad ass (she's!)
She's bad bad, bad ass (she)
She's bad bad, bad ass (she)

[Outro - Pharrell]
