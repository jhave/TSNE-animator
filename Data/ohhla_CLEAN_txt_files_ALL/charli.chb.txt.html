[Vocorder]
Charli, Charli
Charli, Charli

[Charli Baltimore]
What

(Chorus)
[Charli Baltimore]
Who got the 6 foot 9 niggas loving the thang?
Charli, Charli
Floor seats to the Sixers game?
Charli, Charli
Chicks screaming cause they loving the name?
Charli, Charli
Say my name
Charli, Charli
Say my name

[Charli Baltimore]
Flows tumble down like an avalanche
Who ride and murder tracks like an ambulance?
Still rap like I never stepped off for a sec
I'm back and this rap shit just be getting me wet
Y'all know Charli, sorry
For your unbelief
So much tude on y'all like a Diva
No nigga rhyme tighter
Flow sicker, limelighter
Fans need her (yeah she still off the meter)
Hating chicks sick like *cough* she a trick
What y'all know about me
To flow about me
Who be V.I.P
In films with Spike Lee
PHILLY, PHILLY
In case you wanna know where I be
Hold it down for the rest of the peeps
Blessing the streets
BANG, BANG
I'm next in the beat
HUH, HUH
Put your money on Chuck
Cause I'm destine to beat
The fuck y'all know about me

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
[Charli Baltimore]
All my thugs flipping pack money
Living it up
Angels taking it without giving it up
What the fuck
Sheer thongs and we big in the butt
What, what you know y'all feel this
Y'all know who the real is

[Charli Baltimore]
It ain't enough that I paid my dues
Learn the game 
Whole world learn the name
Talk greasy but I earn my fame
What Chicks don't know that the chick so low
Shit earning to claim 
Ain't drop but I'm sophomore in this
Like not that bitch Baltimore on this
Any hate, uh, give more the shit
More to spit, incase you don't know how I rip
Red head still, thorough bread streets West Phil
Left field, came from that, huh, blaze the track
My angels dust hot baby plain as that
Oh he wanna holler blame the rap
Again, second wind now
Back in the game
Still reign
Body parts still remain the same 
Feel me up
Fell the cupboard
Fill the cup with Cosmos, A laze, and such
Mix it up, we sick with it enough

(Chorus)

(Bridge)

[Charli Baltimore]
Play to win
Who got heat with it?
We can take it back to Vaseline on our face, you street with it?
Ride hard till I die hard like Bruce Will, whatever
A buck five hundred thou two mill
So long as somebody fuck with me and my Angels
Getting their wings long as the stuck with me
On my peace to those who occasionally waited for me
Screw face and any motherfucker hating on me
Got nothing but love
Ride burbans on nothing but dubs
No arena shows nothing but clubs
No sweet niggas nothing but thugs
Nothing I duds
Lame niggas say the name uh

(Chorus)
