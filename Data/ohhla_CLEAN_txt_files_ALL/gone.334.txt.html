(Sawed Off)
(Talking)

Now this shit fucked up
You still supposed to be hear man
What happened, what you told me man
You told me you was gonna be right beside me
Now you goooone, fuck I'm posed to do.

(Supa Star) (Chorus)
I just pour out some liquor (Pour out some liquor)
For all the niggas I lost (For all the niggas I lost)
I just roll in my chevvyy high (Roll in my chevy high)
Talking to the sky (Talking to the sky)
(REPEAT 2X)

When ya gone, you gone, you gone, you gone, your gone (Yeah Oh)

Alot of hard times in my door
Every day I pray with my knees to the floor
Like, why the devil have to take his life (His Life)
What the lord have to take him for (Him for)
When ya never call you got to go
Ya take ya last breathe, death knockin at yo door
Too many niggas I lost way before 24
To the point I want to die, don't wanna live no more
I wanna make it to heaven and see my kinfolk
Maybe then I wont cry no more
Cuz my life is going on
No casket going off
As soon as I get my ways I swear that I'm taking off
Like lord jesus, jehova help me, grandma gone, jessie left me, Reggie
gone, my godmother left me, thug can you help me
I'm stuck in the middle of nothin
And don't lead nothing that you ain't know ain't true
So everytime that I miss my homies, I just..

(Supa Star) (Chorus)
I just pour out some liquor (Pour out some liquor)
For all the niggas I lost (All the niggas I lost)
I just roll in my chevvyy high (Roll in my chevy high)
Talking to the sky (Talking to the sky)
(REPEAT 2X)

(Sawed Off)
Everythings going on in my life
I'm living wrong but I'm tryna do right
So many other niggas done passed
Six feet under dirt, underneath the grass
Try not to think about it just to ease the pain
Rollin out puff puffin on mary jane
Can't do too much but wonder why
As the tears still coming from both my eyes
Some niggas done passed, we deal with the past
Wonder if my nigga pooh gone last
Out of the slow line and right into the fast
Its hard to think of a better way
Tryna think about a better day
But my throat get dry my eyes watery, barely got shit to say
I know there ain't no way to bring a nigga back, but I wish I could
Alot of these fake niggas don't understand but I wish they would

(Supa Star) (Chorus)
I just pour out some liquor (Pour out some liquor)
For all the niggas I lost (All the niggas I lost)
I just roll in my chevvyy high (Roll in my chevy high)
Talking to the sky (Talking to the sky)
