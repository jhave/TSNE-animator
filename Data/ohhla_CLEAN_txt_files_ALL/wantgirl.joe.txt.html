Yo, the game is dirty watch how you playin' it
It's your bed watch who you let lay in it
It's your crib watch who you let stay in it
Cause when you think they want they just might
And it's hard to tell
So choose your chicks right
The real ones knowing you front
That's why you gotta know what you want
Walk with them show them the lounge
Conversate talk to them slow
Talk to them drough

[Joe]
Nowadays it's hard to tell
Where them girls is coming from
Are they in it to the finish 
Or just having fun?
I ain't mad at them girls doin' what they do
Out to get that money, but I ain't that good
whoohohooo

I want a girl, a regular girl
I want a girl only trippin off that iced out
I want a girl, a regular girl
If you're for real then lemme hear you holla 
I want a girl that can ride with me
Never get tired of me
That's the girl for me  (that's what I'm lookin for)
I wanna girl that can hang with me (hang)
Wanna do thangs with me (do thangs)
All I want
I want a girl like you

yeah
Uhu

Yo, let's go

[Joe]
Gotta watch how you play
Careful who you choose
Might find yourself in tomorrow's news
Cause some chicks can be scandalised???
You gotta know witch ones to trust
You're the kinda girl I would love to have
Just a little thug with a lot of class
Girl you ain't got no drama,
You must get it from your mamma

I want a girl, a regular girl
I want a girl only trippin off that iced out
I want a girl, a regular girl
If you're for real then lemme hear you holla 
I want a girl that can ride with me (ride)
Never get tired of me (tired)
That's the girl for me  (that's the girl for me) (that's what I'm lookin for)
I wanna girl that can hang with me (hang)
Wanna do thangs with me (do thangs) (my girl)
All I want (uh, yeah yo)
I want a girl like you

[Jadakiss]
I want a girl that look good, cook good
Don't listen to rap, but she still know when the hook's good
All she do is read so she know when the book's good
Love her 'cause she's from the suburb and she looks hood
Lady but in bed she's an animal still
Stick, shift or automatic
She can handle the wheel, uh
There when I call, there when I fall
I want a girl just like you and that's all (I want a girl)

I want a girl that can ride with me (ride)
Never get tired of me (tired)
That's the girl for me  (that's the girl for me) (that's what I'm lookin for)
I wanna girl that can hang with me (hang)
Wanna do thangs with me (do thangs)
All I want
I want a girl like you

I want a girl that can ride with me (uh, yeah, uhu)
Never get tired of me (that's right)
That's the girl for me  (that's the girl for me) (that's what I'm lookin for)
I wanna girl that can hang with me (hang)
Wanna do thangs with me (do thangs) (my girl)
All I want
I want a girl like you

I want a girl that can ride with me (yeah)
Never get tired of me (that's right)
