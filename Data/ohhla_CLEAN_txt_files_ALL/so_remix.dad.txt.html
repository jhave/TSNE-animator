Diddy
Cheri Dennis
Bad Boy
La Familia
The saga baby

Before I met you couldn't take stress
'Cause after BIG died my nigga Mase less
And that's when I started havin faithless
'Cause Black Rob he on trial and I escaped death
Still in your tape (yeah) still gettin hate threats
Still gotta take that
Still gettin sued for money I ain't even make yet
Without you girl I'm incomplete
I can't lie ma I'm in too deep
And yo I know we don't get to spend time together
Just you and me nevermind the cheddar
And though we barely speak on the phone
Could tell by your tone, you hate bein home all alone
And I wish I could sleep witcha
Roll around in the streets witcha
No fans hold hands on the beach witcha
Girl I'd do anything just to be witcha
On the real 'cause i feel so complete witcha
Yeah, talk to me girl

[Cheri Dennis]
I remember what you said
when you said it to me last night
We was talkin and you reassured me everything's fine
When I woke up this morning to get some lovin from you
I turned to one side
to my surprise, I wasn't layin next to you m'mm

Why did you get close to me
Thought it was supposed to be
Me you you me so complete
Why you handelin me this way
What was it you was talkin yesterday
Yesterday, I could say, I seemed to be
So complete so complete

[chorus]
Went away you said nothing
You didn't no kiss no lovin
You didn't it's a shame
But it brings about the weak in me
You didn't spend a lot of time with me
You didn't share things I wanna see
You didn't when ever you're around me it's so complete

[Cheri Dennis]
So I waited and I waited 
'cause I knew that you would call
Hours 1 hours 2 hours 3 hours not at all
If I'm dreamin wake me up
'Cause I just about had enough, I had enough
I cannot see how you would ever let this happen to me
oowoowoo

I still believe that it was supposed to be
Me you you me so complete
If you're sayin that you need to leave
Then be a man about it step to me
Step to me, tell me please
That without me it's so complete, so complete

[chorus]

[Cheri Dennis]
Won't you tell me right now what you want from me
What you want from me
'Cause it's been too long that you've held it in baby
Held it in
Thought you were the one but you just played me
You know you played me
Now I feel that I'm so incomplete
Yeah hoo hoo yeah yeah

[chorus]

[Cheri Dennis]
Please, give me the response I need
I want you to complete me, ohh baby
Pleas, give me all the lovin I need
Promise you'll never leave me whoa baby

[Outro]
Baby what more can I say
'Cause I want you to tell me
What it is you wanna do
'Cause I wanna be with you</pre>
