[TLC] (Jermaine Dupri)
Switch (check it)
Switch (TLC, I like that)
Switch (turn it up)
Switch (aight)

[T-Boz]
I ain't one to be questioned 
About who and where I've been 
I ain't one to be questioned 
About what time I came in 
Tryna squeeze, baby please 
Hit the road and don't come back 
'Cause I can't trust a relationship 
With no trust and that's a fact 

1 -	[TLC]
	Switch 
	Don't take no mess from nobody 
	Switch 
	If they act up just leave 'em alone 
	Switch 
	Don't take no mess from nobody 
	Switch 
	When you're done wit 'em you can send 'em home 

[T-Boz]
I won't answer to no one 
Until I feel I'm ready to 
I'm gonna have my fun 
Doin' the things I like to do 
See, I need space, get off my case 
Stop breathin' down my back 
'Cause we ain't got a relationship 
If that's how you have to act 

[Chilli]
Commitment, true devotion
Right now is not the way for you to come at me 
When I need it, I'm sure you'll be the first to know 
But for now, in my plans, no demands 
I'm gonna have to make a switch 

[Left Eye]
Switch, throw his behind in a ditch 
While my definition states, as it relates 
To us mates, one elimintaes 
And solely contemplates and de associates 
Like my neew drink was V-8's
Just as quick as I get in it 
I drop 'em in a minute 
Like the dollas in my pocket, Speedy Gonzales 
Couldn't stop the way I spin it 
I'm known for breakin' every speed limit 
This switch could be infinite 
I said L to da E to da F to da T to da E to the Y 
Because I'm so fly 
Bring it back to the E 
So come and see me 
At the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (say what?) 
I said if your man starts actin' up 
Switch and take his friend 
Erase, replace, embrace new face, come on 
Erase, replace, embrace new face 

Repeat 1 to fade</pre>
