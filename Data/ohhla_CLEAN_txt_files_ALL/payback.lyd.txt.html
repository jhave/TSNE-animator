[Intro: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah! Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah!!!
Uh! 'Yeah my music 'bout the money
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah!

[Verse One: Lloyd Banks]
Uh! I meet my Forbes at the corner store
The way you niggas rappin out here, I just want it more
Turn the music down you can hear my stomach roar
Bagged a hundred bitches last year just bagged a hundred more
They hatin, But everything that goes comes back
Sticky green funpack jewelry make me hump back
Backpackers want that, and it ain't about the diamonds
Shit! Home or commercial who the fuck you think you rhymin with?!
I got the drama kit, on my Obama whip
Bitches runnin up on my stage, Lil' Mama shit
And  lil' mama thick, and my time was slim
Gone by thirty minutes after I put the condom in

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'm gettin to dough, Louis on my foot put the pedal to the flo'
That's all a nigga know!!!

[Lloyd Banks]
Payback!!! Don't come around here disrespectin 
We don't take that!!! I'm on my letters every second

[50 Cent]
And my heart so cold, man I don't trust a soul
Surely know the bullshit goes you never know

[Lloyd Banks]
Payback!!! Don't come around here disrespectin 
We don't take that!!! I'm on my letters every second

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
They crown me with the punch hat who better?!
I hit Redskins, smoke green and spit blue pepper
(UH!) Benz blue leather (UH!) Jet cool weather
(UH!) Cool meanin hot, so I don't need the top
Calm down breathin stop I start I'm a skip your pulse
Mr. life's the shit Calamari shrimp and boats
C-notes, fly Ferrari different coast
Masseuse and butler I probably ain't gotta lift my toes
I shut my doors on 'em like Jehovah's witness
I done made it to the top like I said, I told you bitches
They don't really want me they just want my riches
So I'm a fuck 'em all, friends, cousins and sisters

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'm gettin to dough, Louis on my foot put the pedal to the flo'
That's all a nigga know!!!

[Lloyd Banks]
Payback!!! Don't come around here disrespectin 
We don't take that!!! I'm on my letters every second

[50 Cent]
And my heart so cold, man I don't trust a soul
Surely know the bullshit goes you never know

[Lloyd Banks]
Payback!!! Don't come around here disrespectin 
We don't take that!!! I'm on my letters every second

[Verse Three: Lloyd Banks]
I turn the club to TV and come Dancing With The Stars
Then I'm in your ear, in her ear, ampin the menage (Yeah)
Niggas they made their money but never knew how it felt
(UH!) In a hundred pairs of pants thats a hundred pairs of belts
Stress kills chronic helps, pussy is for the moment
Ballin like a hornet, see it get it I want it
Everybody know heat hurts you gotta show me first
Magician, but I can turn 'em to a Holy Ghost
You can bring two, three, four of them the war is won
Tip top 'gon make 'em all run, come on son
Think talk just talk, I let my money bark
Put my Ferrari in park, give 'em a runnin start
GO!!! 'Cause I don't feel a single drop of pressure
NO!!! Eagles drop a foreign gwop collector
He better stop pull ahead, he knows my ends straight
I'll clap your girl make the bed break leak the sex tape

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'm gettin to dough, Louis on my foot put the pedal to the flo'
That's all a nigga know!!!

[Lloyd Banks]
Payback!!! Don't come around here disrespectin 
We don't take that!!! I'm on my letters every second

[50 Cent]
And my heart so cold, man I don't trust a soul
Surely know the bullshit goes you never know

[Lloyd Banks]
Payback!!! Don't come around here disrespectin 
We don't take that!!! I'm on my letters every second

[50 Cent]
I'm gettin to dough, Louis on my foot put the pedal to the flo'
That's all a nigga know!!!

[Lloyd Banks]
Payback!!! Don't come around here disrespectin 
We don't take that!!! I'm on my letters every second

[50 Cent]
And my heart so cold, man I don't trust a soul
Surely know the bullshit goes you never know
