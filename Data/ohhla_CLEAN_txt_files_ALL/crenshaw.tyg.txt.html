Song:   Crenshaw at Midnight
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Tyga]
What this feel like (Crenshaw at midnight)
I know I ain't call but believe I ain't far
Somewhere (Crenshaw at midnight)
Really living that life little homie think twice
Niggaz shooting some dice, some niggaz pull at the light
Knew em now everything alright
Car clubs and bikes (Crenshaw at midnight)

[Verse 1 - Tyga]
Step in my Jordan 7'ss my kick game like Tekken
My presence ain't to be fucked with I ball like Gary Sheffield
You out like it's left field catch a nigga my glove real
Young kid, big wheels Daddy Dave's to Earlez Grille
Pick on my life your life shorter than an anthill
You Urkel like a Jaleel I work I morph like big bills
Pardon my drop a phantom park wherever it feels
You girl enjoy the park thrill intercourse the fore meal
Of course it's surreal keep it concealed take a chill pill
Barely wanting the problems cause he know he got em
She knows somebody he know, he know we bout it
Pop it when it get crowded enemies get surrounded
Los Angeles get lost never be founded
Greed have you on mountains lonely and now you drowning
Chill out, relax like lounges philanthropist
Enhancing advancing in larger mansions
Who pay this living insanity motherfucker

[Chorus]
What this feel like (Crenshaw at midnight)
I know I ain't call but believe I ain't far
Somewhere (Crenshaw at midnight)
Really living that life little homie think twice
Niggaz shooting some dice, some niggaz pull at the light
Knew em now everything alright
Car clubs and bikes (Crenshaw at midnight)

[Verse 2 - Dom Kennedy]
Some niggaz in gangs and some niggaz don't bang
Police be pulling us over they all just treat us the same
Never sold no cocaine but I'm as raw as they came
She told me she wanna hang I let her kiss on the chain
Told me she want a ride I told her get on the train
She just think I entertain these bitches don't know my name
For the love of the game I'm not in it for the fame
And if it don't love me back I guess I'm in it for the pay
Stress the fuck out but I just kill it with champagne
And I love driving down Crenshaw when it rain
It's a movie baby, I'm a late 80?s Gucci baby
Streetwear, I fuck with Stussy maybe
Never had much though I gave niggaz too many style
Don't tryin' to front though
I fuck 20 girls out the House of Blues front row
Leimert Park legend you know what's up ho

[Chorus]
What this feel like (Crenshaw at midnight)
I know I ain't call but believe I ain't far
Somewhere (Crenshaw at midnight)
Really living that life little homie think twice
Niggaz shooting some dice, some niggaz pull at the light
Knew em now everything alright
Car clubs and bikes (Crenshaw at midnight)</pre>
