[Kool Keith]
Yeah!  We here tonight, live on stage!
Quincy Jones.. James Brown.. Prince.. Madonna..
and of course.. Kool Keith!
Take it away, at the Grand Auditorium!

Now you're up late, can't get no sleep, I'm outside
Cruisin down 5th Ave., makin love in your ride
You want that baby, but I'm out here thinkin maybe
what if you flip - but it's OK when you're on my tip
Take off your shoes, don't spread my business news
Reachin for the rubber tips it's time to pay your dues
Two girls in the back, bring your friend, make it three
It's the big thing honey, that's the policy
I got to pull down and bring the steel home for you
Break the headboards and tell your girlfriends come over too
Put my motorcycle helmet on and feel the power
Rock and lift the boots, spank the lips for a hour
The mack is back, doin good and lookin fly (2X)
	Keith is in town, it sho' was good goin down
The mack is back, doin good and lookin fly
	Keith is in town, it sho' was good goin down
The mack is back, doin good and lookin fly

[Kool Keith]
Yeah, I must show up, scope the cheeks well with clientele
When a sister wants to see me, I should not really tell
I bought some movies, some strippin joint type of coolies
Boots and thongs, girls flip on my theme songs
They know I damage, with gloves my equipment's on
I got a cape, like Superman, I'ma put it on
Grab the vaseline, make your hiney shine like Mr. Clean
With a purple G-string, you wanna do your own thing
Girls dance for me, pumpin over me
Big sniff is back, word to honey's crack
The mack is back, doin good and lookin fly (2X)
	Keith is in town, it sho' was good goin down
The mack is back, doin good and lookin fly
	Keith is in town, it sho' was good goin down
The mack is back, doin good and lookin fly
	Keith is in town, it sho' was good goin down
The mack is back, doin good and lookin fly

Hello, Room 402
	What's happenin pizzimp?
Yo whassup?
Yo Menelik, I want you to go down the stairs
Get five cases of champagne, order two limousines
	Yeah, I got them honies
And check it out yo
Bring five freaks that's ready to do this
	Aight, let me just see, I'll be down in a minute

[Sir Menelik]
Late night, me Trev and Keith, leave the suite
Three limos deep, with honies greet us downstairs
Prepared to take us, anywhere, tonight's the Grammy's
Afterparty back at the hotel, we're poppin expensive Perignon
I'm the suave Don, this is the average evening
of the celebrities, the days are relaxed
It would seem to most, an expensive vacation package
The pay is good, in Hollywood
A hustler has to mack in fresh gear, my choise of Rolls Royce
and a duplex location up at Sunset and LaBrea
I'm mackin in your area

	Keith is in town, it sho' was good goin down
The mack is back, doin good and lookin fly
	Keith is in town, it sho' was good goin down
The mack is back, doin good and lookin fly
	Keith is in town, it sho' was good goin down
The mack is back, doin good and lookin fly
	Keith is in town, it sho' was good goin down</pre>
