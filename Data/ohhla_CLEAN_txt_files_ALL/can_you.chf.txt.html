[Intro: Uncle Sam]
Word up, word up...

Hear yee, hear yee
Uncle Sam, Stone Creek
For the 9's
Word is bond
I hope you paid your taxes
'Cause it's time to bring the ruckus
That's what's up
Yo Sam, bring it on

[Uncle Sam]
I'm gonna steal your love from your man
And put it in my pocket
Turn your heart around
Never let you down
And then I'm gonna knock it
For all you do, this bud's for you
And give you almost everything you want
Just enough to please you...

[Chorus: Uncle Sam]
Are you down?
Can you feel it?
I need to know now
What you feel
I got love girl
Can you feel it?
There's no need to hide
If it's real

[Uncle Sam]
Pop a little Cristall
Even though I don't drink at all
Put your mind in a vibe
Make you feel all funny inside
Hey, no need to worry
'Cause I won't hurt you
('Cause I won't hurt you)
Just wanna give you all the feel-goods you deserve

Girl I'm gonna be the one
To make this night a night you won't forget

[Chorus x2]

[Popa Chief]
Popa Chief threw the stone in the Creek
Can I tempt your tummy
With the taste of nuts 'n honey
Can I be your playboy
You can be my bunny
Take all my money
Treat me like a dummy
And in the morning, wake and rub me on my tummy
Tickle my fancy, and guess what
I'll tickle you back with something lacey
I'll massage and crack your back
The roughneck chicken needs a roughneck chickadee
The question of the day, is you down with me?
Time ticks, just me and you on the miss'
Grant your every wish
Be your favorite dish, plus dessert
Doesn't matter what time when I do work
Perform like a one man concert
Here's the plan
Pop in a tape of Uncle Sam
Then I'll show you how nice I am
'Bout to make your mate insanely jealous
And if he don't like it, he got to find us to tell us

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
