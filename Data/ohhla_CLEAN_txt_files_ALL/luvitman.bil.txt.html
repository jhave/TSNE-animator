I'm so, thoed in the game
Southside Playaz, Screwed Up Click mayn (love it mayn)

[Billy Cook]
Billy Cook, you know I'm a superstar
Riding foreign car, so fine don't bar
Mo City Texas, messing with the 3-2
BMG 1965, swanging hoo-doo
Who you talking down, on the Screwed Up Click
Keeping cash in the pocket, from pimping a bad bitch
It's the legend, and I'm throwed in the game
Popping my trunk, but man I won't change
Now niggaz owe me bread, and I'm getting fed up
I'm about to pull my pistol, leave a nigga edge up
Bitch be stinking, laying dead in a coffin
I'm a grown ass man, and I stay big bossing

[Hook - 4X]

[Mr. 3-2]
Big Boss, it's the Gov of the click
I'm a Southside Playa, and I don't love no bitch
Got rich lost it all, then I came back up
Riding Harley Dav' truck, bad bitches eat nuts
I flow top notch, break a bitch pocket
In a 6-4, on swangers watch I hop it
Girls bopping, ery'where I go
Ten thousand for a verse, fifty thousand for a show
I know how it is, so I grind all night
Blowing on top flight, pimping all through the night
I might just, knock off the Maybach
A nigga sitting fat, off cocaine and stracks
In a Lac sprayed red, system fin to knock
Never gon bop, and I beat's up the cot
G.D. motherfucker, and it's Screwed Up Click
I'm a Southside Playa, Mr. 3-2 bitch

[Hook - 4X]

[Billy Cook]
Man I'm so cold, man I'm so thoed
Throwed in the game, grip-gripping wood grain
Lane to lane, leaving platinum stains
Banging my Screw, hollin' what it do mayn
Swanging swanging, swang to the left
Pop my trunk, and yep-yep (love it mayn)
Southside holding, 24's I'm rolling
Slow Loud And Bangin', big faces
Man I'm so rich, man I'm the truth
Man I'm the shit, I know you smell me too
My nigga I keep's it real, trill at all times
If a hater get out of line I bring his ass, set this motherfucker off in this game

[Hook - 2X]

[Billy Cook]
Swanging swanging, swang to the left
Pop my trunk, and yep-yep (love it mayn)
