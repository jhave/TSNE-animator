[Fabolous]    Hey baby
              It's Loso
              One Block Radius
[Marty James] You got me (Got me...)
              No need to wonder why (Why...)
              Don't have to question (Question...)
[Baby Bash]   Baby Bash
[Marty James] So clear your worry mind (Mind...)

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Baby, you got me, nobody else gets me
It feels tailor made
Nobody else fits me
Sometimes, it hits me
Vladimir Klits me
I just shake it off, while the jet is takin' off
In like six o'clock (Clock)
I am straight up, shorty
I'm a be gone for a minute, so you shouldn't wait up for me
I'll call you when I can (Can)
Keep your ringer up (Boo)
If I ever get on top, I'm a bring you up too

Chorus: Marty James (MDA)
You got me... (You know that you got me)
No need to wonder why... (No reason to wonder why)
Don't have to question... (You ain't gotta question)
So clear your worry mind (I'm gonna make it all right)
You got me... (You know that you got me)
No need to wonder why... (No reason to wonder why)
Don't have to question... (You ain't gotta question)
So clear your worry mind

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 2: Marty James]
Now I don't wanna
Lose you
But I'm tryin' to do what I gotta
Do too
I know the style of my life might
Confuse you
And I don't blame you one bit (Bit)
I don't even say nothin' when you trip (Trip)
But I thought
I told you
You can put it on my shoulders
I can hold you
And I don't care who all believes me
I'm a show you
Mama, it's been a long time (Time)
I 'lieve ya baby boy's about to shine
I been on my grind
Gotta get this money while the door's just a little crack
I'm a kick it in and make some noise, baby, I'll be back
Gotta keep it movin', ma
That's how we do it, ma
We chasin' dreams and makin' wishes, I'm a shooting star

Hook: Marty James
Now I don't really wanna leave you right now
And I don't even really wanna go (Go...)
And I don't even wanna see you cry now
Baby, you should already know
So

Repeat Chorus

Bridge: Marty James
We can fly away
And start another life somehow
I love you everyday
I never ever let you down
Yeah
I know that it hasn't been easy
But I need you more than ever to believe me (Me...)
I'm a make it good (Good...)
I'm a set it straight (Straight...)
We gon' get it right (Right...)
So trust when I say

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
On the block, on the road, town to town, show to show
You should already know, you stay in my corazon
I ain't lyin', it's hard to find, something like we got it (Uh)
I keep a little picture of my chica in my wallet
Don't cry, dry your eye, I'm a be back, soon
I'm doin' this for you, baby boo, cause I have to
I'm tryin' to make a better life, so we can celebrate
And when I get home, baby girl, you gon' hear me say

Repeat Chorus

[Marty James] I'm gonna make it alright
[MDA]         You know that you got me (Got me...)
[Marty James] I told you (I told you...)
              So clear your worry mind (I'm gonna make it alright)
[MDA]         You know that you got me (Got me...)
[Z-Man]       Put my neck up there for us
[Marty James] I told you (I told you...)
              So clear your worry mind (I'm gonna make it alright...)
[Z-Man]       Put my neck up there for us</pre>
