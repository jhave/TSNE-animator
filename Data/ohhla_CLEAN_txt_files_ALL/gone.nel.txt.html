[Nelly]
Gone, gone - she got me gone
Girl you know you got me gone

[Kelly Rowland]
Nelly got me gone, gone, gone, gone
Boy you know you got me gone

[Nelly]
Yeah... uhh, ay
'Member that chick that used to live right up the block from me?
I seen her yesterday, and she's still fly
She's still right, still tight, still fine
Yup, I still wanna make her mine
And uhh, I want much more than just a moment
See I ain't tryin to lease or tryin to rent, I'm tryin to own it
Yeahhhh, this time I'll make my move
This time I'll show and prove, prove that I'm really irreplacable
Plus I don't know if she ever been told
But I got whatever she needs, yeah
And whichever way we go
No one could ever take what we've got
right here between one another
Don't care what they say, you gon' be my lover
And if it's in-love baby, I wanna fall
Just promise me baby, you'll be here through it all

[Chorus: Nelly] + (Kelly)
I'd do it all again if I have to, throw this money at you
Girl you know you got me gone
(I'd do it all again if I have to, you ain't gotta ask boo)
(Boy you know you got me gone)
Kelly got me gone, gone, gone, gone
Girl you know you got me gone
(Nelly got me gone, gone, gone, gone)
(Boy you know you got me gone)

[Kelly Rowland]
You know I still got the love for you baby (baby)
You still be drivin me crazy (crazy)
And all of my heart, will forever be yours
And no one could ever break what we've got
right here between one another
Don't care what they say, you gon' be my lover
And if it's in-love baby, I wanna fall
Just promise me baby, you'll be here through it alllllllllllllll

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
Look shawty I done told you once, pay attention I'ma tell you twice
I done been around the world but I never met a girl like you in my whole life
It's somethin you need to know, you make me wanna get physical
You make me wanna get intimate, into it, I'm fixin to blow
All my heart, and all my time
I'll give you everything that you wanted, baby just name your price
Mine is yours, and yours is mine
Trust me that's a fact girl; you ain't gotta ask cause
I don't know if you ever been told
But I got whatever you need, girl
And whichever way we roll
No one could ever take what we've got
right here between one another
Don't care what they say, you gon' be my lover
And if it's in-love baby, I wanna fall
Just promise me baby, you'll be here through it all

[Chorus]

[Kelly] + (Nelly)
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Boy you know you got me (gone)
Gone (gone) gone (gone) gone (gone)
Gone (gone) gone (gone) gone (gone)
Gone (gone, you know I'd) gone

[Chorus]

[Nelly] Uh-uhh, yeah!</pre>
