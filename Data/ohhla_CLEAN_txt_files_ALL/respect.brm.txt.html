[Intro]
Most people would consider this illegal

[Chorus]
Since we are the best and you agree with me right?
No need to debate.....the way we run shit
See were kind of like the government, so just repect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate

[Verse One: Busta Rhymes]
It's Bus Rhymes!!!! (HUH!) And I'm back
With the crack, and the thugs, and the drugs, NIGGA BLACK!!!! (OH!!!!)
The best to do it we only deal with the facts bitch
Blazin that I'm so amazin on the tracks BITCH!!!!!!
(BOUNCE ON 'EM!!!!) And I jump, and I skip
And I hop, and I flip over niggas like gymnastics (HEY!)
Watch the way and I'm givin the streets acid
Bastards niggas know I'm the king of the classics
Drastic measures, I'm spreadin like a rash bitch
Class is in session you 'bout to get yo' ass kicked 
Emperor, of every roundtable of the house
(AND WHEN I SPEAK) Niggas respect me as leader of the councilman
God rap, God persona, God scrilla (HUH!)
God body in the flesh call me GODZILLA!!!! 
Now you know you see we be the most prominent
Dominant niggas respect my conglomerate (AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!)

[Chorus]
Since we are the best and you agree with me right?
No need to debate.....the way we run shit
See were kind of like the government, so just repect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate 
Just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate 

[Verse Two: Lil Wayne]
Eh Em, Young Money we in charge
Yes it's Lil Wayne but the money's enlarged
Priorities Young Money and God
Now they wanna know how I be gettin money on Mars
Cause I be gettin paid like out of this world
Hip Hop is a bitch and I'm proud of this girl
But when the sharks come see how the fish curl
This is my day and you 'gon need a referral
I know more about tree then squirrel 
Me don't talk much but that heat so verbal
Brand new Marc Jacobs Pea Coat thermal
Gun outside of the gear external
I'm so fly y'all still at the terminal
I put you in the dirt yeah because I see the worm in you
Dirty South bitch! Admire and acknowledge it
And respect my conglomerate

[Chorus] (Jadakiss)
Since we are the best and you agree with me right? (Uh-huh)
No need to debate..(uh-uh!)...the way we run shit (Yeah)
See were kind of like the government, so just repect my conglomerate (Eh-HAEH!!!)
Just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate (Ha-HAEEEH!!)
Just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate (HA-HAEEEH!!)

[Verse Three: Jadakiss]
Yeah, uh, yeah, yo..
Workers, bosses, Ferraris, Porches
Dope fiends nauseous, crack spot
Race track, horses, big meetings at the
Round table, to discuss what the cost is
Money, change you, devils, angels
We the ones who say what you can and what you cain't do
Respect, power, kush, sour
Haze, airy, pills, powder
Gangstas, varmints, ice, garments
Don shit, real niggas who I get it on wit
When I'm around, my colleagues ain't comfortable
They all got a-sick with my verses for a month or two
(Uh) Yep - wrong nigga to have a problem with
The blade first, then the bullet gon' follow it
Yeah, if you lucky, I might hollow it
D-Block, just respect my conglomerate

[Chorus]
Since we are the best and you agree with me right?
No need to debate.....the way we run shit
See were kind of like the government, so just repect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate
