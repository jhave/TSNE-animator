Typed by: don_vaskez@freemail.hu

This sure is
I got that-a old crazy shit from round the corner you know
The homeboys and the brothers be slangin' this shit
But anyway, (everybody must get stoned (x4))
You over there singin' some shit, talkin' 'bout
Everybody must get stoned
I don't know but that shit sounds good to me

[Verse 1]
Hit the joint, up the bomb, take a puff
Till you just can't get enough of the skunk
A punk nigga named Doe wanna take control
But the primasso puff on the indo (keep puffin')
Let me take it in then I let it out (let it out)
One of you motherfuckers pass the barred owl
Peace to the niggaz in all the Budha spots
Slangin' fat bags o' weed and runnin from the cops
(runnin' from them fools)
I hit the leno then pass it on
To the cypha' of dreadlocks gettin' stoned
(All the dreadlocks lya')
Roll a fat joint, twist it at the end
'Cos I get high with a little help from my friends (from my friends)

[Hook]
Everybody must get stoned
I said everybody must get stoned
(Everybody must get stoned)*variations*
                   (x4)

[Verse 2]
Hit the blunt of the bong, take your dope
Now my head's in a cloud of smoke and no joke
Caught the up-tight motherfuckers puttin' me down
'Cos I talk about the green shit in every town (Everywhere I go)
You right in front of me, I can't see ya
I'm blind and faded and I got the G-rock
And everything's gonna be alright
When I pass that toochi from the left-hand side
Niggaz is havin' a good time tonight
Roll it up, hold it up, pass me the fucking light
(Gimme that lighter)
Indo or the home-grown
Light it up, everybody must get stoned (gotta get stoned)

[Hook - different variations]

You know how we talk the talk
We say, stoned is the way of the walk (x4)
