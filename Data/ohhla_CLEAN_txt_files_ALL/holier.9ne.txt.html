[Intro - Tech N9ne]
We been doing this for a long long time now...
this music thing... and touring, y'know...
and still... I ain't met one person that could maintain righteousness
Know what I'm sayin?

[Verse 1 - Tech N9ne]
A wise man told me evil was lurkin and if you found it
try your best to not put yourself around it
Cuz when you in it you tend to push it to the limit but
then when the sin beginnin you wish you would stay grounded
I went all over the world and I done been through it
at the beginning I knew I wouldn't give in to it
but temptation over the sensation
women I'm embracin, so many of them waitin
Contemplatin how to get fornication
and yo door when its late with the motivation of Satan
so they say, but things go they way
but its more then pay told her hey yo the phase for today
But lust it sets in, and crush your chest in
for dust your destined, if drugs are let in
Enough to nest in, probably make you punch your best friend
and next kin cuz you let s-e-x win
You mean to tell me you can fight this land
with brightness and walk the path of the righteous man?
Yo, I want to believe that, itching to see that
if a positive person can shake the negative feedback
that this life has to offer and its faster
What a disaster if you didn't obey the master
Cuz that's mutiny, it would be new to me
if you was on tour with Tecca Nina and you could be

[Chorus - Krizz Kaliko (Strange Lane Choir)]
(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world  would you
(Know me, know me) I know you be strong, but you been gone a
(While) I know you still my
(Child) So I'm pullin for you
(Hold your only) Your soul and if you know it wont you
(Show me, show me)  You can see me if you look up for a
(While) Holier than
(Thou) So I say it for you

[Verse 2 - Krizz Kaliko]
How can I move the crowd without losin out of my faith?
Lucifer out of the way  (way)
Or maybe he don't even exist
I ain't gotta trip
Gettin hookers out of my system (get you out of my system)
See thats how he tricks em
Let em sip then a big ol mickey he slips them (I wonder why)
Music soothes the savage soul
People could lose or win, but lack control
Wish we could choose to live and fast the soul
We smashin women then bypass the soul
They believin everything we breathe in
Half of us is Jesus, the other half is heathen
And how we get that bad half out?
We pray the lord would cast that out
Hope you got blessins let them pass that out
When we travellin and pass that route
Keep us under their grace is the place where we had that doubt
Where I stand, its pointin at me, but its with my hand
I need you, you holier than I am, I am

[Chorus - Krizz Kaliko (Strange Lane Choir)]
(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world would you
(Know me, know me) I know you be strong, but you been gone a
(While) I know you still my
(Child) So I'm pullin for you
(Hold your only) Your soul and if you know it wont you
(Show me, show me)  You can see me if you look up for a
(While) Holier than
(Thou) So I say it for you

[Verse 3 - Tech N9ne]
This verse was intended for a gospel rapper that we all admire
and he goes by the name of Da T.R.U.T.H.
All we wanted was a righteous man to lead us in the right direction
and maybe if he came we could change and regroup
So we laid it down and sent it hopin' we would rap wit us, track splittas,
Waited, and none of his people got back wit us
We kept callin' and they finally answered, when a month passed
We was prepared to do whatever, give it if he wants cash
but the lady who represent em would never send 'em a message from a secular messenger
Never be no nepotism, we supposed to be brothers, on the road to teach others
but the flow would be covered, don't wanna mess with Tech they know that we smothered
anybody who diss us, retire they weak flow
Cuz this is the pinnacle, nobody flyer than me, bro
If you didn't like it then I admire the ego,
And if they never told ya, then you better fire ya people
Cause fallen angels came for your help and then she pushed 'em
but Christians be the first to run they mouth about Muslims
but they always helpin in the hood, but y'all closed me out
y'all didn't even really wanna know what we bout
And we bombay, trippin on this on the don spay
and I had to spit on in cuz I couldn't afford Kanye
I needed help, your people showed me the wall
be lowly as y'all, I guess y'all wasn't holy at all... naw!

Much love to the gospel MC
J Blast for coming down in the midst of sinners to try to help us remedy our situation...
Even though most if his peers told him not to
cuz we secular MCs.
Thanks for giving me Da T.R.U.T.H. CD and bringing true Godliness to our circle bro...
God bless you, for being so...

[Chorus - Krizz Kaliko (Strange Lane Choir)]
(Holy, holy) If you live in another world would you
(Know me, know me) I know you be strong, but you been gone a
(While) WHILE, I know you still my
(Child) CHILD, So I'm pullin for you
(Hold your only) Your soul and if you know it wont you
(Show me, show me)  You can see me if you look up for a
(While) WHILE You're holier than
(Thou) THOU So I say it for you
(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world would you
(Know me, know me) Would you know me?
(While) WHILE, WHILE
