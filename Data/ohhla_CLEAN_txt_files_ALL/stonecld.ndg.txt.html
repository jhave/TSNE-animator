"And can no hood fuck with gangsta shit" ---&gt; Tray Deee

	[Intro/Chorus - x4]
	Stone cold baby
	Stone cold baby
	Stone cold baby
	As cold as can be

Hey let's party y'all
All I wanna do is have a good time
Tonight it's goin down
Hey just roll it up
It don't matter who's at the party
Somebody's leavin with me
Hey let's set it off
I see the girl that I want (that I want)
I see the girl that wants me
Hey it's gettin hot
But before my body gets bothered
Let me tell you this about me
Momma kicked me out when I was sixteen
Woke up the next mornin with some D-O-G's
I felt a little bad but I had money
Went and bought some dope and some blue khakis
While you were hangin out in the promised land
I was growin up on the Long Beach sand
So if you're intentions were to leave with me
Remember when I'm satisfied
I'm just as cold as can be, stone cold

	[Chorus]

Damn this is a cavi beat
I feel like takin time on this beat
To smash you all
But teachers are supposed to teach
So I'ma teach and you gon' listen or else you got to fall
To battle that's a thing that I've always done
Never lost a battle that means I'm number one
Don't hang with cowards cos they always run
If you be rollin with cowards don't forget your gun (ahhhh)
Damn I really love to compete
Another victim I would love to delete
Come one come all
Taste the agony of defeat
But I know how sneaky niggas can be
When e're they fall

Some niggas try to take my cash
Dumb niggas try to make me blast
These days it's kinda hard to laugh
I gotta host of new friends I never had in the past

Some niggas try to take my cash
Dumb niggas try to make me blast
These days it's kinda hard to laugh
I gotta host of new friends I never had in the past
Stone cold

	[Chorus - x4]

Hey let's party y'all
All I wanna do is have a good time
Tonight it's goin down
Hey just roll it up
It don't matter who's at the party
Somebody's leavin with me
