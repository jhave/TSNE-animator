[DJ Drama]
Ladies and gentlemen, it is quite unfortunate
That we have to gather here
for this, unjoyous occasion
I stand here before you, DJ Drama
and ask you for a moment of silence...
A lot of fallen rappers
A lot of fake emcees
Some, even your favorites
can no longer be with us
It is a trying time, it is a tough time
But because clearly there was no way
ANY of them, could stay alive
while 'Loso a/k/a Funeral Fab was here
We now, must lay them all, to rest
So sad... {*sobs*} so sad
We may now start, the funeral service</pre>
