[Bashton the Invisible Man]
Finally we see the God's head attendance
Mind over matter, body representation of the soul
Until the soul overcomes the illusion of mortality
Love

[Chorus (over a sample of "For every shell that fell, there's a story to tell")]
On the path of guts and glory
Bullets bless my flesh and now it's holy
My blood in a cup, you pour me
My body have ten stories
On the path of guts and glory
Bullets bless my flesh and now it's holy
My blood in a cup, you pour me
My body have ten stories

[MF Grimm, Verse 1]
Under fire, didn't know it
Ears ringing, something started glowing
Lungs collapsed, ribs all broken
Lit car up with slugs, now it's smoking
Bloody horror, leather seats soaking
God, you have to be joking
J's hit, I got to save him
Bullets ricochet in my head, I can't see him
Trying to grab his hand, I can't feel him
Out the car, maybe I can drag him
I'm shot again, for air gasping
On my own blood I'm gagging
Open door now I'm standing
Open fire at me blazing
Shot me in back, I fell
Lord did we deserve this hell?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
As I lay on floor dying
Passed away, spirit flying
Afterlife made contact
Then God chose to pull me back
Got a glimpse of Heaven, not on list
Open eyes, back on Earth pissed
Where I was, was so bliss
Why he bring me back like this?
Surgery on spine, bullet caused this
Slim chance to survive, but I take risk
Made it through, now I'm healing
Even got back all my feelings
I should be dead, I'm living longer
As time go on I get stronger
Lyrically some might better spit it
But remember the difference, MF Grimm Reaper lived it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
My own life is my content
Police had criminal intent
Rolex on arm was eighty thousand
Dollars disappeared, where our dough went?
Always plan for tomorrow
Meanwhile live for the moment
It can be taken in an instant
The road to glory has torment
Vastness of Heaven and Hell's the extent
Hearts get hardened like cement
It will turn you to a demon
So recognize your life is Hell bent
Increase size Jet Jaguar
Show the world you're a superstar
Lyrically some might better spit it
But remember the difference, MF Grimm Reaper lived it

[Chorus]</pre>
