Song:   Gettin' Gettin'
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's Tyga, bitch. (Oh oh oh)
Yeah, Tyga-man, Gator, GED
'07's been a great year
And uh, '08's gonna be a better one

[Tyga]
Hey, hey, what's going on in the world today?
Can it be a way I pronounce my age?
Like, hey lil' mama
Come my way
Heard you clean up good, baby
Be my maid
Oh, you got a tarp?
Black? Silver car
Pick one, plenty room in my shopping cart
But no piece of meat can hurt my heart
Translate: I'm in a veggie-race
All I eat is green-colored cake
If I fade away
It'd be the last thing that I ate
Oh my my
Dollar signs
It's alive!
Frankenstein!
Tyga
I'm
Einstein
Rappin' crimes
Flier guy
I'm make them angels tired
My whip talk
Baby like look at my fucking dial!

[Chorus]
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every day
I'm
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every day
I'm
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every day
I'm
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every dollar

[Gator]
Hey, yo, how you doing? My name is Gator
All around the room, I be gettin' that paper
Boy oh boy, I like to spin this
chick, and the tin it
then I kicked it
I pa-poo-pa-pa for that spinach
and it makes you feel like I'm trippin,' (I'm not)
'Cause you ain't taking the trips I'm trippin,' (I'm over here)
No nightmares, everyday is Christmas
I'll buy you what you want, bitch
Lay off the shit-list
I'm gettin' and gettin,'
And don't you forget this
Every dollar that I see
While my niggas pop bottles in the VIP
'Cause you don't know no better
But to get that cheddar
Hauntin' every day
Yeah, that's forever
Money, money, money
Yeah, that's my schedule
You talk too cheap
You talk to ever

[Chorus]
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every day
I'm
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every day
I'm
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every day
I'm
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every dollar

[Tyga]
The song is not over
We just have to take a quick intermission
Whoo, tired
[Music stops]
Bring it back
[Music resumes]

[Chorus]
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every day
I'm
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every day
I'm
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every day, (Oh, oh)
I'm
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every dollar (Oh)

Every
Every day
I'm
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every day
I'm
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every day, (Oh, oh)
I'm
Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every dollar

[Tyga]
I'm getting every dollar
I could do it with eyes closed
And I'm waiting on this check to come
When it get here motherfuckers going crazy
Like the thousand-year ten-thousand-aire
I ain't hurtin' no-one when I put it in the air
Them just self-made out of your age
Tell the old-head to go to bed
'Cause I don't hear your marketing highness
I hear cheese when I sing
Why Z, is your skill grade of a G?
I'm still on tour
Haters, you know where to find me
Haters, you know where to find me

(Hey, you know this ain't right, Tyga
This ain't right, man.)

Gettin,' gettin,'
Every
Every dollar</pre>
