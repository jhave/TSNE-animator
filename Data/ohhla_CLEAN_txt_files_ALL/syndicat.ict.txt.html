[+] Yo, what the fuck is that?... (*Gun Shots*)

[Verse One: L.P.] 
Now, nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga please
I scratch emcees like dog scratch flees
Grease, your competition, never finishing
Indo keep me high and I'm always on a mission
When it comes to kick it, AWWW I get the lowest
Bang like George Foreman, kick ass like Chuck Norris
Only fucking winner with these fools selling Gucci
Whispering MC H, just like Crispy down with Cooci
So those who wanna step into the steel like bleaks 
Come get this lyrical ass whipping that's gonna last for weeks
We got grease, Hardcore Hip-Hop gangster beats
Niggaz that'll do you'll leave you dead in the street
Recognize through this, this is how we do this
Barrel to your motherfucking back oozes (*Gun Shot*)
It's your lyrical rock Syndicate killer, and fuck all niggaz

[Chorus: Powerlord JEL]
Now you wanna fuck with us, cause you recognize game
You recognize real motherfucker
Syndicate forever, Posse of the clever ------&gt; Ice-T
Now you wanna fuck with us, cause you recognize game
You recognize some real motherfucker
Syndicate forever, Posse of the clever ------&gt; Ice-T

[Verse Two: Hot Dolla]
The Rhyme Syndicate will never die, well let me tell you why
Cause we're locs that's always on a Ho-Ride
If you hear me, then I know you know that danger
I snatch mics from emcees, I move around with anger
Behavior of the maniac, that's all I've had in me 
Bombs'll get brutal when I lock my mind, it's empty
Simply I'm in this, but Gangster found that Genus
The one last murderer that never served the sentence
Wise up than an Asian, that's holding to his books
I love them ghetto crooks, gave my banging for a hook
Now I'm much much longer when my pops was stupid flexed
I wanna get hex and bitches fuck with my set
Don't let 95 patty, produce it like a hearse
These such fucking little punks, they think they down cause they curse, man
Fuck you motherfuckers, you ain't shit, you ain't crazy
Cause Rhyme Syndicate be doing dirt on the daily

[Chorus: Powerlord JEL]

[Verse Three: Powerlord JEL]
Can I be destroyed? Like Roy with two niggaz long enough 
Now, I'm strong enough, to bust out handcuffs
Return of the rough, and rugged, so fuck it!
Rolling in a bucket, tracking down my dockets
It's a fact that I be busting, fools lusting
Throwing fools away like wind dusting
Hand rushing, like Head Hunters, so I hunt heads
Leaving fools dead in a red, hear me what I said
It's the Syndicate, I yelled from the day we call Eternity
Picture of all busters who ain't heard of it
I'm burning it with dealers, killers
Cars stealers, cap peelers, big wheelers
Cool like the Chin Chilla, living in a villa
So nigga pass the Nillas 
And let me take you back to the days of Crokersacs and Cadillacs
When niggaz broke their backs on the street to make ends meet
We roll deep; in a late night hour on the..

[Chorus: Powerlord JEL until faded]</pre>
