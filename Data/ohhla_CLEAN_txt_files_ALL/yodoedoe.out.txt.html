I love it when we do shows drunk for 50 G's
And have a hang-over the next day and half of what ya check say
Go straight to F-A, I shake and let the bed spray 
on my hoody how it should be
We sex and puff goody and waa
People live in my house be sharing tricks
Using girls, I make a chick buy me a thousand pair of kicks
And all beef we deadin with 357's
And if I bring the tec in kiss the bride like a weddin
The Outs we got cream ??? its my team
I love it when a plan come together
Cuz I'ma sex for years if I take a girl upstairs
Bring friends so after you suck mine you'll suck theirs
We out for one thing we run game like what
This my car, my joints just in his name
She love me touchin her junk be all the same
We runnin train on the low
Der der-der-derrrrr

Aiyyo the Outs compose music like Mozart
While you fags still takin turns ridin on the go-cart
I be bashin girls on limosine panelings, nut
They rub it in like aloe and lanolin
Bass hammerin, take sixty ?annisins?
And still feel the force like anakin its damagin
Sons vanishin and betta stay gone
Cuz for my cottage with cheese I'ma brake storms
Spit napalm, give a hardcore fan somethin to take home
Besides you fake clones
Outsidas, see us toe to toe
And bump ya horn and scream out loud yo doe doe

[Pacewon]
Yo we keep y'all penny less, cornballs envious
Four-five semi with a scope hurt any click
Anti-social niggas used to be the friendliest
Now even the cops don't come on south twentieth

Hook

[Yah Yah]
Turn the spot light up on all these rhyme biters
That bite our style to make they teeth shine brighter
When brian rap spit venom like a diamond back
Lying flat, attack y'all mice and rats
I roll a blunt light it up then I pull it
Pass it to little man knowin that I shouldn't
Soul parting self, sometimes I fart and belch
Yellin doe doe doe I got at chicks in garter belts
I walk through the white house lickin off five rounds
Threatening the president to lye down
I know spots that ain't chill where niggas stay'n kill
Leave ya brains spilled from ???
Naughty po-po ducks that wanna hold us
Claimin sold up all the cold cut
To a narco in a tow truck
You might think I'm crazy 
put me in a white room, let me enlite you
I'm haulin ass like zoom
