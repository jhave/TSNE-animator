[C-Bo]
Look at them looking like them know me that a bitch you can blow me
Gun in my holster proceed with caution when you approach us
Mob boss with a strong arm fuck the long arms
I swinging a ferrari bomb weed and Bacardi
Big fees now Shit be wild got the bullet proof hummer in a fifty cal
Bulletproof vest can't rest the west is death I stress
The armani with the merclessnes
Yea I flip ritz in a click
That comes with minis niggas gun till they done with them
I never flip the hair I smear
I can't draw the homies like eternal affair but on the down low
You know how the round go respect have a nigga wet up with ammo
You was then they let off more shots than big trick playa hate this
Cuz we labeled the shitness

[Yukmouth]
Labeled a boss a nigga with that make more moves than talk
When a nina busts with no discretion
Wet'em up they bark a nigga that said first a luny
Is what it cost to be the boss we floss the life is hard
These phoney ass niggas and fake ass broads
No laws hate that nigga that ball but fuck them all
They can suck the balls of a nigga that bucks the toughness
That calls of big as this we the mob for the village and 8 cons
Shoot up your squad with teflons I'm above the law
Just like steven segal I'm break their balls off in three
In your hall I can't be lost bitch I can't be tossed
Guns let off niggas and blue tape your money is lost
I control the start of the race these niggas about to do
I'm the boss

Chorus: 2x
I'm a boss bitch I spark you hood with a boss
I'm a boss can get tossed by niggas above the law
I'm a boss money talks and bushit walks
I'm a boss it takes hard to be the boss
I'm a boss bitch I spark you hood with a bitch nigga

[Daz]
You want to be a bitch nigga and die nigga
And get your muthafucking life lost and die on how you'd flossing
Ain't nothing I don't like snitches always fonting and bluffing
So let a real nigga know something Mama be yo dub less
Fuck around with us you get caught up without a vest
Scared out that sess smoke chronic or flex with a tech
Sweating your homie got checked caught a slug in his neck
I don't like niggas that be talking and hollering that bushit
I'm a gangster that pull quick yeah I'm already bitch
You don't want none of this that nigga daz be droppig all that
Gangster shit I pull a hit out sex you gone kill everything
In a hit out 100 spokes straight spit out bitch
Niggas to get out they gas shit straight out

[Dru Down]
I had to mp up to being a lil droopy in the hood
Fo sho it's dru down for the count making my blahhhhhhhh
Triple naked when I'm acting boom take a move every
Second thinking about my homie that figured me out
Mighty hard to leave you star
Cuz shit I see ya'll on stuck like in some tar
Balling fast cars and losing I get a new one
If lose my chain medallion muthafucka I get a new one
It a boss to pay the cost staticly back on track
Through a super duper jip I'm a gangster
And being a boss is just part of it
Dru down ain't no blow up till I pop your bitch

Chorus: 2x
I'm a boss bitch I spark you hood with a boss
I'm a boss can get tossed by niggas above the law
I'm a boss money talks and bushit walks
I'm a boss it takes hard to be the boss
I'm a boss bitch I spark you hood with a bitch nigga</pre>
