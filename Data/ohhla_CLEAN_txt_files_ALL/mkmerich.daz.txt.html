[Daz Dillinger]
I said bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch make me rich
Shut the fuck up bitch and gobble a dick
I had a bonified head demon
Certain enough to get the head screamin'
Damn, this head was screamin'
Please believe it, I had a skirt named Tammi
Baddest bitch I ever seen outta Miami
I had a bitch named Vivica, Fox outta Riverdale
She was an expert on coca cola and fish scales
Damn baby, won't you roll with a real rider
I'm in the Cadillacs, baby in the califlour
I'ma show you somethin' that's rarely seen
Baby girl givin' the califlour to me
I'm just a hustla, gangsta, pimp into pimpin' shit
Pimp with a diploma for pimpin' shit ridiculous
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch make me rich
Shut the fuck up hoe and get my grit

[Chorus]
I got all the hoes yellin' (I'll make you rich!)
Rollin' in my rag top, homies in the ???? ????
Bouncin' with an ounce not givin' a shit, said -
(Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch make me rich)
Bitch... bitch... bitch..
(Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch make me rich)
Bitch... bitch... bitch..

[Too $hort]
When I was young I had dreams of gettin' paid
I ain't sell dope to fiends back in the day
This little bitch that I knew from around the way
She believed in me and did whatever I say
Let's get rich so quick, you the hoe, I'm the pimp
Together we'll never be broke again
I put it down, big pimp right up out the town
Got another hoe, and every night I found -
A pocket full of doe, I do it so well
You can tell it raise hell but the pussy gon' sell
Fuck jail, I'm leavin' to the house up on the hill
And bought a new Seville cause the game is real
And now I'm known as a legendary player
Learned to pimp game and became a millionaire
I live this shit, I know how to get a bitch
But you don't need millions when your nigga rich

[Chorus]
I got all the hoes yellin' (I'll make you rich!)
Rollin' in my rag top, homies in the ???? ????
Bouncin' with an ounce not givin' a shit, yellin' -
(Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch make me rich)
Bitch... bitch... bitch..
(Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch make me rich)
Bitch... bitch... bitch..

[Daz Dillinger]
Beotch!
Hoe I don't give a shit though (hoe I don't give a shit though)
And then I made her eat a dick though (and then I made her eat a dick slow)
Bitch I don't give a shit though (bitch I don't give a shit though)
Because I know you just a clutter (bitch I know you just a clutter)
You just in need of some deepthroat (you just in need of some deepthroat)
Cause I got somethin' for that deep throat (cause I got somethin' for that deep throat)
It's like bitch, bitch, bitch, what the fuck you thought?
That I'd give you dick for free? (ha ha)
Now shut the fuck up bitch, and gobble a dick
And paid pimpin', always out from under me
I'm just a G by nature, yeah I'm gangstafied
I'm just livin' my life, pimpin' hoes day and night
You see that bitch $hort? God damn, you see that bitch?
The one over there with them big ass lips
With the rock on her hand, that mean she's engaged -
To the paper, hoe catch the vapors
Come and give a real nigga some of that paper your nigga gave ya
$hort don't play with hoes, it's like this -
I tell a bitch quick, it's like this you lil' dumbass beeeeeeooooootch!

[Chorus]
(Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch make me rich)
Bitch... bitch... bitch..
(Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch make me rich)
Bitch... bitch... bitch..
(Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch make me rich)
Bitch... bitch... bitch..
(Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch make me rich)
Bitch... bitch... bitch..

[Outro: Daz talking]
You dirty bitch!
Yeah, you know when you fuckin' with a bitch
And you fuckin' with another, and she know that you fuckin' with another
And she done did everything under the sun to fuck with you
You know what I tell 'em -
Not only that you gon' stay with this bitch and gon' get me a bitch
You gon' live with this bitch
Only motherfucker in the house gon' do some fightin' around this motherfucker is me
And if you got an allegory on my pimpin' and you tryin' to see my shit and skill
Bitch you ain't really tryin' to support me and you ain't tryin' to be with me
Now that's one level of the game motherfuckers can't even understand, you know what I mean?
And not only is I can't sexually please her, you gon' help</pre>
