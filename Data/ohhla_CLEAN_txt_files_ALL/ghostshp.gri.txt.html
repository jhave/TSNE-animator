Typed by: AZ Lyrics

The rain came down like a blanket
And insulated the street lights
Turned the gutters to rivers
And sailed away with my free time
Nowadays I got alot more to juggle

A monster to struggle
Down and lock to the rubble
Need to slow down
Cause I don't know if I can go out
And force a little sunshine

Out of broken bone powder
Crushed
Holdin on to the rocks in my gut
It's the blood around that
Boils that forces me to get up

Like jump
All of this is drivin me mad
I got a razor with a poem on it
Smilin back
It kinda feels like I'm under attack

With no boundries
Cannonballs drownin
And tied to my foot
Sunk

They'll probably find all the wreckage in the morn
Come runnin from they beachhomes
And watch it from the shore
All aboard
The new ship is leaving the port

I only sail now to calm that storm
To calm that storm

I'm floatin away
It kinda feels like I'm drownin
I'm floatin away
Drownin, drownin, drownin, drownin...

The belly of it creaks and moans
In the water like a monster tryin to eat my bones
I'm out here tryin to solve the problems
That has breached my hull

And got me jumpin off the plank
In every sea I roam
It's not OK no more
Drop the anchor tie the
Cap the whales to it

Let's die in the daytime
And cry to it's music
Yeah
I never thought that I could harpoon love
And watch the world turn red

With a drop of it's blood
Like FUCK
All of this is drivin me mad
I watch the water from the crows nest
Fighting the path

This whole things like a knife in the back
I can't grasp it
I feel like I'm floating alone
It's my casket

SINK
I don't think that I can go further
SINK
All of this is feelin like murder
SINK

They'll probably find the wreckage in the morn
I need to sink so I
Can calm that storm
To calm that storm

I'm floatin away
It kinda feels like I'm drownin
I'm floatin away
Drownin, drownin, drownin, drownin...</pre>
