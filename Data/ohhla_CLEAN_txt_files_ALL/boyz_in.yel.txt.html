Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Cause the boys in the woods are always hard
Some of them white-trash some of them ride hard
Knowing nothing in life but trucks and sticks
Don't quote me boy cause i ain't said shit

Now, I like my butter and greens, I like my plate full of soul
I'm the one who got that sloppy hooker holding my doe
I'm the king of the strip if strip means i get down
I'll pull trick and make em' put a dick in the fucking ground
I'm as smooth as it gets
I'ma move into this, Double-wide with a pouch and pay 200 of rent
When you run into this might as well run into bricks
I been learning how'da stack you, put a track on deck
Put a dollar on the table and stand up on your bitch
Holler if your able and let me see how dirty you get
If your feeling like a fighter put a plug in your clip
Cause if you empty ammo at me you got more to deal with
More relatives then a cat with kitty litter and piles
With motherfuckers born to give a cop quotas and files
Should i show you the style or should I show you door
I could show you how'da hide a pound of weed in the floor cause...

[Chorus]
Cause the boys in the woods are always hard
Some of them white-trash some of them ride hard
Knowing nothing in life but trucks and sticks
Don't quote me boy cause I ain't said shit

Wait up hold up a second who said the south can not kick it
Well I guess spittin' ain't shit when give ignorant tickets
Open up on your rhythm lables got to try harder
If you give the truth a chance you will go two times farther
Most guys don't bother so I fuck with KP drop a verse about me
Cause me is gettin' the cheese me is breezing in peace
Cause me a preaching MC
Too many sick in the beach, scratchin' and reachin' for he
Back so why do yelawolf is gotta buzz in the street
I ate a tuna sam-mitch made of bumble bee
Posted up on a corner with a rumblin' teeth
Are you and K, Catfish Billy are you they
Yeah I'am in the creekwater jumpin' on snake head
Never had I got it so I'm pumpin' them breaks yeah
Ain't ch'ya ever pull hunny frontin' them cars
this is why, this is why, this is why I am hard</pre>
