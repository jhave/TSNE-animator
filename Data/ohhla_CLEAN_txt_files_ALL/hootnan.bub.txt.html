[Chorus - Justin Timberlake] (Timbaland) - 2X
I could go number one ten times
Pretty girls that like my rhymes
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine
Guess what, what (don't really give a hootnanny)

[Verse 1 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Now I done banged a heap of +Betties+ in various modes of transport
And told them there's the exit, be sure that they close the damn door
The quiet country types is usually those I'm scared for
Some scared at first, but usually those demand more
Really ain't conceited, I just call myself the cutter bug
A horny little parasite that all these women love to love
Tell you what it is today, I ain't concerned with what it was
Bubba fittin to get it done, I put that on my brother Russ
Hear them in the closet, in the kitchen, just a whisperin
Bubba so psst psst, knowin that I'm listenin
I ain't got a chain, boy my pecker's all that's glistenin
What ya'll steamin on folk, ya'll in need of discipline
I ain't leavin nothin, this the house me and my people built
Huggin me and dappin me, buddy I can see your guilt
It's cold when you're wrong and you lookin like you need a quilt
Ya'll matter less everytime this margarita tilt

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 2 - Bubba Sparxxx]
A lot of ya'll was thinkin that Bubba would probably disappear
Get some show money from +Ugly+ and buy a keg of beer
Add another pig to give my other pigs some company
Rent a doublewide and just live it out in luxury
In due time, but there's business left to tend to
I need another farm to bequeath my next of kin to
And another track before my great aunt Missy
Yeah I've been drinkin but I ain't that pissy
Thinkin back to when my daddy told me what it's all about
He said "no matter what I do in life, some of ya'll pout"
I can deal with that long as all my folks is eatin good
Let that chowder pass over more than any Easter could
I'm on the roll again and I ain't talkin ecstacy
Tell them folks at Interscope they fittin to write some checks to me
Soon as me and Timmy finish up this latest pig schlop
Man I think you right, it ain't nothin but some hig-nop

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
I'm back off in the saddle with that smile and that cajolery
Momma always knew how big a stallion I would grow to be
Way beyond these suckers both lyrically and vocally
I doubted for a moment, now it's clear to me I'm supposed to be
An uncanny wit plus a time that is impeccable
Make the sharpest cat feel his mind is just a vegetable
How does Bubba do it, you won't find it in a manual
Confused them all at first, so this time is understandable
Starin at the ceiling fan, ponderin my future now
Wonderin what the hell to do with all this loot I found
Got my tractor polished up and I'm as drunk as Cooter Brown
Navigatin yet another one of Timmy's super sounds

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
