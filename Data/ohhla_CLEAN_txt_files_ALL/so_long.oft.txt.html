(MC Hammer talking)
Our Father, which art in heaven
Hallowed be thy Name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
And forgive us our debt
As we forgive our debtors
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory
In Jesus' name
Amen

(Chorus x2)

So long, so long so long
I hope to see you again

(Verse One: Busstop)
I never got a chance to say goodbye
I could've made it to the funeral, I won't lie
But I didn't want to see my homie laying that way
Now I regret not paying respects to this day
Cause its hard to accept I'll never see u again
Not only true homies, we were best of friends
I hope u understand my pain and grief
Cause I can feel u up there looking down on me
Now I need to get somewhere so I can think
I'm going to the graveyard to pour my homies a drink
I sip the liquor, snip a rose and lay it on the grass
And never in my life have I felt so bad
It's Saturday night, I'm at the gravesite
Sitting by the tomb stone holding a flash light
The scene is cold I got sweated in my palm
I'm hurting so inside I feel so i drop the bomb
Lil' Jay could of been more than nineteen
now it seems every night he's in my dreams
O.F.T.B. means operating from the bottom with a tribute to the homies that's gone

(Chorus x2)

(Verse Two: FlipSide)
A lot of my homies died from gang affiliations
While others die from, imitation
But I ain't tripping, I learn from my losses
From gang banging u got's to pay the causes
You only live once, so live it to the fullest
A lot of my homies, they died by the bullet
Tony ?? not a convict
Just a gangster who grew up in the projects
A big daddy, is what he drove
Back then, to me it was a Roll's
Top Gold, he wore it on his clothes
He had a gangster live on pose
Just keeping it real so don't set trip
Much love from the Low, the Bus, the Flip (O.F.T.B.)
If you ever in Watts take a look at the wall
Dedicated for love dogg for all of y'all

(Chorus x2)

(Verse Three: Low MB)
I remember everyday, I use to play
With my niggas Ros Bowlow and Lil' Jay
But now they gone and I forgot
And homies is crazy real, and still plotting
I know one day I'm going to have to meet my end
But that's the day I hope we all gon' meet again
And give each other big love at the crossroads
It's hell on earth so I'm hoping Heavens your World
I'm still chilling, with Flip and Bustop
I hope y'all chilling, with T.C. scoop with Chop
And all he other, homies that a nigga miss
For every candle, I blow out you know I wish
That we was all getting high, parle and trip
And have some laughs about the good times we use to have
Back in the days when we was all doing real bad
And right now a nigga trying to get his money right
But y'all know me yo, it's still tight
I never thought, we'd have to say goodbye
This kind of shit bring tears to a gangsters eyes
But the Low, you know I'm going to be strong
I won't say goodbye, I'm saying so long

(Chorus x2)

(Verse Four: MC Hammer)
I know we done all lost a friend before
A victim to the game in these street wars
But we gotta remember, we all gotta die
No matter what you do you can't escape your fate
David ?? was a warrior, a soldier
You had to pay attention to the game that he told you
A dark night when he lost his life
Full of than drink he couldn't put up a fight
So he slipped on over to the darkness
My homie, my Uncle, my dearly departed
I shed tears cause I wish he was here
(He never see his Nephew get to make it up here)
25 when he took his last breathe
He barley had lived, and he had to come and see death
I can't explain all the pain that I feel
?? yeah that's real

(Chorus)

So long, so long so long
I hope to see you again
So long, so long so long
I hope to see you again
So long, so long so long
I hope to see you again
I hope to see my homies one day soon

To my Grandfather Willie James, my Auntie Rest In Peace
To all my Nephews
(To my big homie Big Jay y'all rest in peace)</pre>
