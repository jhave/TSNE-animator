[Sleepy Brown]

Just got paid and I'm feeling right 
Bout X'd out on a Friday night
My girl paging me but she'll gone be allright
Cause I'm falling through later on tonight
Now looka here, before we go
We gotta stop by seafood galore
Two piece whiting and a shrimp to go
A Large lemonade now I'm out the door
Bob's car wash keep my white walls tight
Just put down on the Holyfield fight
Ride by the hill holla at E. Neil
East Point raise ya flag been hill been real 

[Chorus]
Weeastpointin'  x5

Tell me where you from baby (East Point)
Tell me where you from (East Point)
Tell me where you from baby (East Point)
Tell me where you from (East Point)
Tell me wehre you from baby (East Point)
Tell me where you from (East Point)
Tell me where you from baby (east Point)
Tell me where you from (East Point)

[Sleepy Brown]

Flying like a bird all thorugh the night
Ain't gone stop til the morning light
Suckers looking crazy casue they want my ride 
But lil do they know that I pack my side
Cause my 98 oldsmobile
With bullets chrome the real real
So split that peel and bump that joint
Forever hollerin East Point
I said my 98 oldsmobile
With bullets chrome the real real
So split that peel and bump that joint
Forever hollerin East Point, Ungh

[Chorus]

[Cool Breeze]

My name cool breeze and I can't lie
I'm still teacher's pet at Cutta high
And I'm real laid back and like one of a kind
And if I leave East Point it'll be to find
Rico used to tell me when I turned nineteen
That Imma be big in the south like buffalo wings
And I been blowing up the spot since the single came out
And I'm starting to make a lil money it's getting hard to count
And if I carry any with me it's in a small amount
And I keep the rest in a stash by my auntee house
So check the internet for when I hit your local stages
of the the dirty south pages under south coast phrases

[Chorus to Fade]</pre>
