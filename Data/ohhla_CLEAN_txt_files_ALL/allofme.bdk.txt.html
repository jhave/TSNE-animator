Let's.. get busy..
Daddy Kane

[Big Daddy Kane]
You know B.W. I've heard it said
that a woman is a man's greatest gift

[Barry White]
Sure you're right

[Big Daddy Kane]
And success ain't nothin unless you have someone to share it with

[Barry White]
Mmmmm, so true, so true
I've always felt that.. it's great to achieve in life
Not having someone other than yourself to share it with it is, uhh..

[Big Daddy Kane]
Sho' YOU'RE right

[Barry White]
.. quite sad

[Big Daddy Kane]
In my case, I may have found someone (mmm)
I want, all, of that someone

[Barry White]
Yeah, I know what you mean
Well I'll tell you my friend
Just, communicate with her
And always say what you mean and mean what you say
because, it's her that you want.. all of me
Aoww

..

[Big Daddy Kane]
Come here baby
Come bring ALL of you to me
When I say I want all of you
I mean I want all of you from your head to your feet (mmm)
I wanna taste everything from your lipstick to your toenail polish

[Barry White]
C'mere Kane brother

[Big Daddy Kane]
I want you.. I want you..
I want to hold you, I want to massage you
I want to comfort you, I want to sooth.. you (mm!)
You know the way you're standin still there
I just wanna lay on the floor and make love to your shadow
(A-heh) Sounds silly don't it?

[Barry White]
Not really

[Big Daddy Kane]
But for real, let me come on over there
Run my fingers through your hair
Hold your Nair, and undo that brassiere
My dear

[Barry White]

[Barry White]
Oh I can tell you're serious aren't you?
I'm glad to see that you feelin, this way
that there's somebody in this world that..
make you want to give up that kind of commitment
Love is such a beautiful thing when it's, equally shared

[Big Daddy Kane]
Tell em Maestro

[Barry White]
When two people, find the same common ground
They call it, having, so much in common
Making love is one of things that people, these days
seem to find too common

[Big Daddy Kane]
Communicate B.W.
