Song:   Blessed Are Those
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
It goes: life, difficult times, and mad crimes
Some pay the price while others do fine
Blessed are those who struggle -- God loves you
And Wisdom is the principle thing for Kings and Queens

[Killah Priest]
Many of our lives will end, it's like a sad song
from a violin, trapped like Daniel's in the Lion's Den
Tryin to pie-rce the iron skin, of Leviathan
Souls blowin in the violent winds
God help us, if we die in sin; I hear the trials
in the cries of men, that's when the riot begins
It's ike things never get better, we forever
servin Nebuchadnezzar, since the days of our ancestors
Slaves to a man pleasure, building great architectures
Sharp dressers, smart professors
Start my lecture, I build lyrics like a art director
Show it to you like the film projector
Blessed are those who struggle, from day to day we all hustle
Comin home with sore muscles, and scarred faces
Scuffed knuckles, we all share the same trouble
Separated couples, sometimes it seem like
there's no escapin, the clutches of Satan
Spendin years in state pens, awaitin patient
Dreams of a scholarship, ended by a hollow tip
Politics and number slip

[Chorus]

[Killah Priest]
Once, shoved in ships, now we Bloods and Crips
Thugs with clips, niggaz who love the clicks
Hit the clubs and shit, so they can rub their hips
Hugs and flicks, niggaz with drugs and whips
Cash Rules this Rotten Apple, it got a worm in it
Corrupt sinners, in my man's jeep
with the windows tinted, sippin Guinness
Observin all the clinics, and liquor spots
They make me lick a shot through the rooftop
I never seen the glory
In the ghetto it's the same story
Cigarette butts and cold coffee, black faces
and white mouths, they cry out, for the White House
Ain't no wealth shared, it's welfare
and poor health care, self scared
It's senseless, the way they got our black princess
on public assistance to end our existence

[Chorus]

	It's a blessing... to struggle
	It's a blessing...
	(repeat 2X)
	Yeahhyeahhh, it's a blessing, just a blessing
	It's a blessing... *fades*</pre>
