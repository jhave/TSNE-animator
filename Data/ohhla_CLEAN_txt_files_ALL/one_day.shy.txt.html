[Intro: IMF Blue Steele]
It's so gutter... It's like, yeah...
I always knew I was gon' be the best...
Come on, but it's like, I ain't really know I was gonna be the best
'Til I talked to the best, cuz it's like, what I said...
(We love you BIG, we love you BIG)

[IMF Blue Steele]
The greatest, how many niggaz could take this?
Rhyme that'll design ya facelift
By the time I'm in my prime I be robbing The Matrix
By the time I'm in my prime I be robbing The Matrix
Come on!

[Chorus: female singer]
All my life, I knew, deep down, one day, I'd make it
So I waited, and waited
For, my chance, to show, I knew, one day, I'd take it (take it)

[IMF Blue Steele]
Alright, the night before I repped it
BIG looked me in the mirror, he said "When you spit it, spit it with a vengeance
When I died, I wasn't happy, in my ride, the brothas clapped me
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, Sean was there, uh-huh, the Dom Perignon was there
Cristal was there, but that ain't saved me
My pistol was there, but that ain't save me
And that's crazy, cuz I'm dead right now
My baby, my lady is fed right now
And they ain't worried about no bread right now
Cuz they ain't worried about no feds right now
But listen to what I said right now
It's been three years, and my fans, ain't never dropped a single tear
Dropping bombs to old shit, wishing I'm here, come on"

[Chorus]

[IMF Blue Steele]
BIG said "Make ya sure vision is clear, son
You gotta change the game
Cuz everybody eating now, game is lame
If I was there, they couldn't even claim that fame
But what's ya name?" I said "Christopher Dallas"
"I like that, cuz my name is Christopher Wallace
You better follow, this way you might be going is hotter
And God pressured me harder, day by day
Cuz you sparked the interest about the things you say
But anyway, rock gold and ice
Fuck platinum, you acting like you know the price
You know that ain't right, you know it's damn wrong
And I'm hearing, more of me than you in every song
Pac still acting like he out of the cage
And when you gon' come take me out of this grave?
And tell the whole industry, get out of my way, come on"

[Chorus 2: female singer]
All my life, I knew, deep down, one day, I'd make it
So I waited, and waited
Now, my time, has come, I'm here, I'll hold it sacred, I made it

[IMF Blue Steele]
He said "I'm coming back home just to bring a plaque home
I'm fucking with you, you ain't gotta do all that
Just change this game back to the thing called rap
And I promise you, you will have a spot where I'm at"
I said "Damn, BIG, shit changed when you left
It's like, you should've took the game when you left
These niggaz ain't saying shit, they wasting they breath
They got, all these young niggaz wasted for death
And you know how I feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell and never rocked a cell
I know you glad to get up out this hell
But what you telling me gon' bring me lots of sales"
He said "I'm good, you ain't gotta be walking floss
Just go hard before you get ya point across
But this is how the story ends
I made it to heaven, let them show me in"
