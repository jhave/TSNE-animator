[Hook]
You balling
If you got Sprewell rims, and they crawling
If you got four five, Clarions balling
You hit the club on dubs, and your name
They be calling, calling, calling, calling
You balling
If you push a candy color, with butter on cutters
You got a flock of girls, and they all know eachother
With the command of your voice, they all
Become lovers, lovers, lovers, lovers

[Mike Jones]
I can catch boppers like Paul Wall, with the wood out my grill
I can do a girl wrong, and she gon be by me still
I can get caught cheating on my feet, maybe she will
Never leave, cause I be spitting my game so real
I'm Mike Jones (who), Mike Jones Jones
That's been a baller, before I even grabbed a microphone
Swishahouse, Swishablast no more minimum wage
Independently paid, living lovely and laid
I never ever cheap talk, cause I got a platinum grill
I changed the game over, with Sprewells on my fifth wheel
My album Who Is Mike Jones, coming soon
My album Who Is Mike Jones, coming soon
Already, I pull up on Perellis with wood leather and grape jelly
T.V.'s falling down, watching DMX in Belly
Swishahouse Swishablast, we come first not last
Police pull me over, so they could play my Dreamcast
And my XBox, I got stubborn rims
They keep going, even when I say stop (maaaan)
Mike Jones in your ear, they gave me MVP
And this is just rookie year (Mike Jones)
Is a baller baby, shot caller baby
In the Lex having sex, twenties crawling baby
I stay balling, T.V.'s stay falling, 23's stay crawling
I'm the definition of balling playboy (maaan)

[Magno]
My rims spinning, I swear I got me Sprewell shoes
I hop out, wearing And 1 Sprewell shoes
I'm moving slow like freewells move, I chop the block so hard
Them niggaz bopping, like them females do
It's Magnificent, I'm acting bad with Slim and Mike
I'm that boy that you see, rolling them rims you like
I'm pimping dykes, either wearing Tim's or Nike's
Haters see I'm trying to shine, they wanna dim my light
But can't do it, cause I shine too bright
(say man what kind of rims you got), whatever kind you like
And best believe, that twelve be in the trunk
Yo and if I'm in the Benz, it's a 12 with a V in the front
Wood grain, leather black seats
Magno with no cash flow, is like Luke without his gapped teeth
So forget, what my Porsche cost
Just realize I got enough do', to pay for R. Kelly's court costs

[Hook]

[Slim Thug]
I played a lot of blocks, so my cash stack fast
I got a lot of rocks, and I ain't talking bout crack
Slim Thug's a high roller, and I ain't talking bout dice
See I got a lot of cars, and they ain't nothing nice
When it come to balling, I'm a vet in this shit
Everytime I get a car, I'm wetting the bitch
Street rich young stunner, I don't play no games
I switch cars three times, and stay on swangs
I'm respected, got the cost of a house on my necklace
That boy reckless, straight out of Texas
I ain't gon talk about my Sprewells, y'all know I got em
I ain't gon talk about my diamonds, cause I know y'all spot em
Y'all wanna know what I claim, bitch read my piece
You wanna know if we ball, bitch read my teeth
Ha, I'm Slim Thugger, that name ring bells
Everything Slim touch, guaranteed to sell, bitch I'm
