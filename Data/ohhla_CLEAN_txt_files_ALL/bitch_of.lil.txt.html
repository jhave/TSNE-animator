[Intro]
If you want that real thuggin' shit, that gutta shit, that otha shit

And they fuck with a real nigga, ya feel me

[Verse 1]
Yea, I want the funk, bra

Cause I still got no fuckin' manners
I'm 22 I'm to old to be acting manish
Pick up yo camera, go ahead and take a picture
I'm a legend in the flesh (BASED GOD!)
And I'm high and, I'm cocaine (BASED GOD!)
Ion play no games bitch
