No one's home, I'll be there in a sec
And all I keep thinkin is wreck wreck wreck
Ding-dong goes the doorbell as I'm straight for the nightie
She said, "Hold on a sec," to make sure her crib was tidy
I steps in, with the Puba grin
And I say, "How ya been?"  But all I'm thinkin is skins
I said, "What's on the agenda for the night?"
She said HBO was boomin and Foreman was about to fight
Cool, I'm down to see him drop a body
So I, dim the lights and it was me and this hottie
Round one, round two and then the fight was through
And I was thinkin all the things that I can do
I threw my arm upon her shoulder, this is what I told her
"Baby grab ahold-a I'm as solid as a boulder"
She said, "Stop it!"  She tried to change the topic
I said, "C'mon honeydip because you know I wanna knock it"
Then she broke down in tears
And I've been waitin for weeks, but weeks feel like years
"Puba, I thought you was a friend"
I said, "What are you sayin hon, I gets no skin?"
I gave her some advice I put the shit on ice
And then I told her, yeah yeah

	C'mon honey, don't front
	Honey don't front, c'mon honey don't front
Ha hah, c'mon honey don't front
	C'mon honey, don't front
	Honey don't front, c'mon honey don't front
You know what time is it
	C'mon honey, don't front
	Honey don't front, c'mon honey don't front
Knock it off, baby baby knock it off
	C'mon honey, don't front
	Honey don't front, c'mon honey don't front
Huh

See hon was a good friend, I seen her more than just a bend
(What's a bend?)  A bend is when you spread the skins
Why pretend?  If honey bend, the God is in
She called me friend because she didn't want to see the Jim
Now now-now now now just wait a sec
In cases like this, the Puba usually gets wreck
But this night I settled for a little raincheck
Before I left I mmm-mmm'd all on her neck
I like to civilize em first before I run up in
Educate em then politely speak upon the skins
I'm the type of nigga to be careful of a digger
And I still can't figure how they try to play a nigga
So, c'mon honey cause I know you're not a stunt
But it ain't no need for you to front

	C'mon honey, don't front
	Honey don't front, c'mon honey don't front
Honey don't front
	C'mon honey, don't front
	Honey don't front, c'mon honey don't front
Ha hah, you know what I want
	C'mon honey, don't front
	Honey don't front, c'mon honey don't front
Yeah yeah yeah
	C'mon honey, don't front
	Honey don't front, c'mon honey don't front
Big kid flavor

Sha-ah, sha-uh, sha-ah
Sha-uh, sha-ah, sha-uh, sha-ah
Ha hah!  This is how we gonna move it on yo

Give me a mic and I'll wreck shit
Cause it takes less than a sec for me to wet shit
But I just do my shows and catch the hoes and wear my 'Bauds
And hang with those who I know are not down low foes
Oh my lord, climb aboard, here's the love train
Brother tried to hitch a free ride, back off shit stain
We got the lingo, hon stop look and giggle
Stud Doogie drops a beat and then we watch the ass wiggle
Oh my good, this is how it SHOULD be done
So c'mon hon
I'm not Luther Vandross, Babyface, or Freddie Jackson
That's OK, cause I still get a piece of the action
Don't worry honey, cause we got things covered
The best thing I left undiscovered
We can get this 40, step to the corner and get this blunt
It ain't no need to front

C'mon honey don't you don't don't don't don't
YaknowhatI'msayin?  Let's get it on
Ha hah, Stud Doogie Doogie Doogie
Yeah, Ala Ala Alamo, you know how it go
S.O.S., ha hah!
Yeah, c'mon, c'mon, ha hah
C'mon, c'mon
S.D. pumpin this shit on the reel to reel
Ha hah, let's do it like this
Yeah, yeah, on the bug out, uh
Yeah

Ha hah, and you don't stop
And you won't stop, and you don't stop
Baby Pop, in the thing, knowhatI'msayin?
