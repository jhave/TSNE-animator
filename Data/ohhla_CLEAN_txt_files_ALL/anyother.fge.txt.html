Hmmmmmmmm... mmmmmmm
Today is, not like, any other DAYYYYYYY
This one is runnin, turn a darker shade of GREYYYY
What, will, I, have, left (tell me tell me)
(Somebody tell me now)
When, this, hard, rain's, gone awayyy
There is a safe place, that I used to KNOWWW-hohhhh
It's the only place, that I want to GOOOOOOO
Where, else, could, I (tell me tell me)
(Somebody tell me now)
'Til, this, hard, rain's, gone (ah-ah-away)

[Wyclef Jean - repeat 2X]
Grandma, grandpa, mother, father
Sister, brother, Lord
Please help the child
I heard the preacher say it's okay, I heard the preacher say
I see the airplane
I hear the engine on the boat
But y'all can't see me wavin the flag
Somebody please wave the flag

[Norah Jones]
What, will, I, have, left (tell me tell me)
(Somebody tell me now)
When, this, hard, rain's, gone awayyy
Today is, not like, any other DAYYYYYYY
So I'm gone, I have to find, my own wayyyyyyyyyy
(People, we gotta find another way!)
Can, you, tell, me, how
When, the, hard, rain's, gone (ah-ah-away)

[Wyclef Jean]
I see them wavin the flag
Tell the chopper over here man we wavin the flag
I see them wavin the flag
Tell the boat over here man we wavin the flag
Man I'm wavin the flag
Tell the chopper over here man we wavin the flag
Man I'm wavin the flag
Tell the boat over here man we wavin the flag, wavin the flag, wavin the flag</pre>
