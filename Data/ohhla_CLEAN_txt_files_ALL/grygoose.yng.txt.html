Ayyy yup

[Intro 2X: D-Roc]
Y'all niggaz ain't crunk
Y'all niggaz don't bump
Y'all can't blow out the trunk
Y'all niggaz ain't crunk

[Chorus: Kaine - 2X]
If you don't give a fuck
Put yo middle fingaz up
Aint no kool-aid in my cup
Gimme that Grey Goose (that grey goose)

[Verse 1: Kaine]
This here for my alcoholics
What's that drink grey goose they call it
A big ol glass wit a bird on the bottle
A nigga wanna get more drunker so he swallow
Back up, buy two coronas, you'll tell an ugly bitch in tha club you want her
Gonna drink mo liquor than a drunk, get crunk
Til a nigga breath smell like skunk (Hanh!!)

[D-Roc]
Drankin everyday like gasoline in the car, you can find me at the bar
Or the liquor stoe, to get some mo grey goose so I can wet my throat
Walk up in the store, grey goose right there
How much that is, let me get that there
Put yo middle finga up if you don't give a fuck
Tilt yo head back, now finish the cup

[Chorus]

[D-Roc]
285 sip 75, 75, south on 75 to the turnpike (x2)

[Kaine]
Take that trip to the bottom, bottom (x2)
Just take that trip to the bottom, bottom
Take that trip to the bottom, bottom

[Verse 2: Kaine]
Alcohol seepin outta your pores
Smellin like a liquor bearer steady talkin to whores
Say that nigga so drunk, he'll fuck the floor (fuck the floor) fuck the floor
When the day start a liquor in tank
That nigga can't get a bitch, its like he ready to fight
But the goose got him loose so he don't give a fuck
He just whip it to the bar to get another cup

[D-Roc]
I drink grey goose, call me the ugly duckling
You ain't put in on this, you ain't drankin nothin
I drink by my goddamn self
Ima get drunk by my goddamn self
Turn up the bottle, drink it cowboy style
Sweatin like a motherfucker buck ass wild
Put your middle finger up, if you don't give a fuck
Tilt ya head back, now finish the cup

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3: Kaine]
G, gotta grab a bottle of that sheeit
R, right back at it with my click
E, everybody drunk then a motherfucker
Y, yall stay drunk than a motherfucker

[D-Roc]
G, mean that ya gotta be grown
O, ya gotta put a cup on yall
O, outrageously drunk
S, see I got something in my cup
E, everybody gettin fucked up

[Kaine]
But buddy on tha floor torn up
Of that goose get ya loose, and known to fuck up a crew x2

If you, If give a fuck now
If you give a fuck, give a fuck now
If you, give a fuck, give a fuck now

[Chorus] - until fade</pre>
