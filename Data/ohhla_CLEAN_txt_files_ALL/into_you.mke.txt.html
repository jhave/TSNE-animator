[Verse 1]
What it do, me and you boo a perfect match
They wasn't lieing when they said opposites attract
I've been peepin you for a minute trying to get up in it
You "Olive Oil", I'm "Popeye" on spinach (Mike Jones)
I'm in it to win it, I ain't in it to lose
Out of all the girls in the world you the one that I choose
You stayed down when I was broke and disgusted
So you know that you the only one that I'm lovin
I' ain't going to never cheat on you never beat on you
When times get hard I ain't gonna never leave on you
Like any other couple we got ups and downs
But my boo stay down, cause she know that I'm down
I'm Mike Jones (Who) Mike Jones Jones
And got love for my girl and can't leave her alone
She ain't worried about how tight my platinum teeth shine
She just want me to give her quality time
Yeah we brake up one day and get together the next
Who doesn't to us that's just better sex
Girl it's cold outside, here put on my sweater
Let me plug in your gloves so you feel more better
Just thinking about my name get you wetter than niagra
I go long hard and strong without the use of viagra
I'm the master and treat my female like a queen
But keep in mind lil momma I'm the queen Mike Jones

[ChrousX2- Fades] [Chopped]
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so Into You
