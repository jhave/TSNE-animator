Intro/Chorus: Le-Le, (Caffeine)

Hahahahah, c'mon, uhh
Reminisce, reminisce with me	(Grimey)
Come go with me	(So much shit in this ghetto)
so you can see the way that things they used to be  
(Grimeys, uhh, grimeys)
in the ghetto, reminisce, reminisce with me   (Starsky, corruption, grimey)
Come go with me	(Nigga grew up fucked up and some)
so you can see the way that things they used to be 
Yeahehyeah

I tak you back to reminisce on when the times was better
It was way before the cheddar
And niggas flossin big baguet-tas in their neck-lace
Ghetto wasn't so mellow at this time
Rewind and you'll find the year was '85....
We was dead broke, me and my brother and my mother
copped the one-room flat, no cover just a floor mat
The dresscode then was tuff skins and croker sacks
Hit the scene at 15 and then, copped me a sack
No joke, it seemed like then it was a crime to be broke
Watchin my people scuffle in the admist of gun smoke
Peer pressure got me fuckin bitches at lunch
then we're shakin them stunts to get high, blaze a blunt
Just to stay calm, I kept a pistol in my palm
just to breeze thru these concrete streets of Vietnam
Don't be alarmed, this fuckin world was built around a twist bit
Mama never told me there'll be days like this
Shall we reminisce......

Chorus: Le-Le, (Caffeine)

Reminisce, reminisce with me
Come go with me	(Can you think back with me huh?)
so you can see the way that things they used to be
(Can you think back to when you was in junior high?)
in the ghetto, reminisce, reminisce with me   
(Uhh, high school, brought up in this shit)
Come go with me	(Them was the days baby)
so you can see the way that things they used to be  (Love em)
Yeahehyeah

And fuck the suburbs and the meadows, baby we can party in the ghetto
where niggas keep their weapons concealed, it's all real
What happened to Joe? He got smoked two weeks ago
Wouldnt've died if he kept his eyes in his own vehicle
You know how the game goes when you caught up in the struggle
and got two jobs to juggle, wish my father was here
to reminisce it with me, a fuckin shame
I guess I gotta charge it to the game, but shit ain't the same
as it use to be cos it use to be
you could smile to get wild in your own fuckin community
Block parties, street fights, kids flyin kites
Big wheels flyin down hills on dirt bikes
Fool what happened to the love? It used to be so lavish
But now niggas parish over bitches, weed and cabbage
Flashy habits, imported fabrics and plush tones
We need to leave that bullshit alone
Now can you think back with me, c'mon?

Chorus: Le-Le, (Caffeine)

Reminisce, reminisce with me	(Now can you think back?)
Come go with me	(So much shit in this ghetto)
so you can see the way that things they used to be  
(Think back to when you used to play, play freeze tag)
in the ghetto, reminisce, reminisce with me   
(Play tackle football in the middle of the street with all ya partners)
Come go with me	(Ha)
so you can see the way that things they used to be 
(And then we, then we hit a lil', lil' girl scout down the street, ya
wanna)
Yeahehyeah  (Play hide and go get in this shit?)

Reminisce, reminisce with me	(Ha ha ha, uhh)
Come go with me	
so you can see the way that things they used to be  
(Sit on the porch all day)
in the ghetto, reminisce, reminisce with me  
(Niggas steal for the weekend, y'knowhutImean? Sunshinin)
Come go with me	(Run lights)
so you can see the way that things they used to be 
(We're here for the street lights, you know you, you know you gotta
be here for the streetlights)
Yeahehyeah

Reminisce, reminisce with me   (You know that shit)
Come go with me	(That's same shit that nigga's can't forget right)
so you can see the way that things they used to be  
(Ain't nothin like the ghetto baby, uhh)
in the ghetto, reminisce, reminisce with me   (That's right)
Come go with me	(Niggas was raised in this shit, y'know)
so you can see the way that things they used to be 
(Now niggas switchin for better thangs)
Yeahehyeah

Reminisce, reminisce with me	(Uh, better things, flashy rings)
Come go with me
so you can see the way that things they used to be  
(Wit deez, they bet-ter, ha ha ha
in the ghetto, reminisce, reminisce with me   
(Y'know, ha ha ha, flashy cars, big homes and shit)
Come go with me
so you can see the way that things they used to be
(Imported thangs, y'knowhutImean?)
Yeahehyeah    (More of them thangs we need, y'knowhutImean?)

Reminisce, reminisce with me
(Niggas ain't tryin to be greedy though, ha ha ha)
Come go with me      (I just spread the love with my partners, ha)
so you can see the way that things they used to be  
(Y'know, that's how we do, nigga we're from the ghetto mayn)
in the ghetto
Reminisce 	(yeah uhh)
		(Skrilliano talkin to you baby, uhh)
		(This how we usually do, this how we do now)
Reminisce	(All we do now is get money)
		(Seikos, and reminisce on those)
