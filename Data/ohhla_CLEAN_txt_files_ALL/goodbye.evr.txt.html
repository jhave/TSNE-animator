(Goodbye)

[ VERSE 1: Everlast ]
Goodbye, it's over, it's through and done
Our relationship is no longer one on one
So I quit, girl, I don't need this
I'm disgraced cause in my face you spit
I caught you steppin out with another guy
And after givin you my love I deserve to know why
How long has this been going on?
How long have you been doin me wrong?
You thought I didn't know?
You thought I'd never go?
Well, that's why I'm makin this song
To say goodbye

(Na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)
(Na na na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)

[ VERSE 2: Everlast ]
Pack your bags and leave, get out of my sight
I won't share you with another man on any night
You tried to play me for a fool
But now you'll find that you been schooled
By the E and it's plain to see
You thought you had luck like a four-leaf clover
Your luck just ran out, homegirl, it's over
I hope you had a lot a fun
Were you lyin when you said that I was number one?
Well, I guess it doesn't matter
It makes no difference
I caught you with a smokin gun
Or so to speak, girl, you're a natural sneak
And the hand you dealt me was really weak
But that's alright, you won't see me cryin
I brush a girl off when I catch her lyin
So when I toss you out, don't dare ask why
Don't try to return with a tear in your eye
It's just my way of sayin - goodbye

(Na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)
(Na na na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)

[ VERSE 3: Everlast ]
Using me, confusing me, inside you're bruising me
You think I'll stick around so you keep abusing me?
Wise up girl, I ain't playin
You try to make it better sayin let's hit the hay and
Make love, then I'll know that you're loyal
But I can't take the stress, don't need the turmoil
You told me that you love me but it was a lie
You know that I care but I must say goodbye
Who is it you're thinkin about when we're kissin?
And when we're all alone is it him that you're missin?
I couldn't stand the feelin that I got
When I seen another man standin in my spot
Next to you, so what you want me to do?
Forget about it act like it never happened?
Turn the other cheek and wait to get slapped again?
Or until you say when, you're through with me
But you will see I'll be the first one to say goodb-y-e
So when I toss you out don't dare ask why
It's just my way of sayin - goodbye

(Na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)
(Na na na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)

[ VERSE 4: Everlast ]
I must admit it, you hid it well
Did you get your kicks puttin me through hell?
Runnin around with your new found child
He's not a man, he can't get wild
But that's alright, girl, you made your choice
And maybe by now you're sick of my voice
But it's too bad cause you made me mad
And I'ma show you all the things that you mighta had
Then you'll be the one feelin pain and misery
Regrettin the past (goodbye) cause you're history
So when I toss you out don't dare ask why
Don't tug at my sleeve as I walk by
Don't try to return with a tear in your eye
It's just my way of sayin - goodbye

(Na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)
(Na na na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)</pre>
