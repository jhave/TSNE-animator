[Krayzie]
Kill me, son
Yo, it's on
Come follow me to the ghetto
(Dedicated to the hustlers)
Come follow me to the ghetto
(Hustlers in the hood)
Come follow me to the ghetto
(To the projects)

1  - 	Come follow me to the ghetto
	But this ain't a place that everybody can go
	(You got to be a thug to know the love in the ghetto, ghetto)
	Come follow me to the ghetto
	No this ain't the place that everybody can go
	(I say you got to be a thug to know the love in the ghetto, ghetto)

 	Come follow me to the ghetto
	But this ain't a place that everybody can go
	(You got to be a thug to know the love in the ghetto, ghetto)
	Come follow me to the ghetto
	Nope this ain't the place that everybody can go
	(I say you got to be a thug to know the love in the ghetto, ghetto)

What a wonderful day off in the neighborhood
G-double O-D good mornin' to ya
(Wake up) get up, hey there, whassup?
Let's take a stroll through this place we call home
And everybody be knowin' your name
The PJ, where we tryin' to survive
Of all our good times after workin' all day
So we hangin' all night, drinkin' 
Feelin' all right from the love in our community
You're a friend to me keepin' it real 
Is what we done to get by day
You watch my back, you back is got 
What a nigga from, it's like that
It ain't all good, then again, it ain't all bad
It's hard times, but some of the best times we don' had 
Now can you feel me?

Repeat 1

And I gotta give my love to the projects nigga, feel me
We should let him know we ain't forgot
It's about this on your block
When they got a fist full a rocks, runnin' from the cops
Keepin' it real, they try to come up with a hundred dollar bill
If not, anything to get a meal is all right
It's all about that bank roll
Cuz when you're broke low, only the strongest survive
I know people who vanish, so just do what you need
Just demand to sit public or when they get business 
And if it's illegal, just play with your fears
I hope I'm forgiven for robbin' and stealin'
Stickin' your butts up for 50s and 20s
Dollars, quarters, shit, even pennies, it don't make a difference
I'm hungry, just give me, y'all feel that?
Casualtie's caps get peeled back
It's wild down here where we live at
Real quick you could get killed, that's the way it goes
You never know
Givin' my peace to hustlers strugglin' in the ghetto, ah
Tryin' to make that money, what we'll do to make that money

Repeat 1

What you know about hard time?
What you know about the hard time?
What they know about hard time?
Say, what you know about that hard time?
I can feel it, feel it

Hard time
What they know about the hard time?
What they know about hard time?
Say, what you know about that hard time?
I can feel it, feel it

[O]
Supercat told you that the ghetto's real hot
But you's didn't listen
So we gotta deliver another rendition
For instance, everybody knows how it go
1st of the Month, don't front, you did there before
The place where random family confront you 
Cops will try to hunt you
Cats will try to pump you and stunt you
Nobody wants you to succeed, just fail
The crabs in the bedroom theory
Clearly the ghetto has it's ills, but hear me
The streets is where I learned to chase goals instead of my tail
Learned I wanted to sell lyrics instead of Yale
Studio time instead of time in the cell
I was compelled to excel
But to appreciate heaven, gotta see hell

Repeat 1 until end
