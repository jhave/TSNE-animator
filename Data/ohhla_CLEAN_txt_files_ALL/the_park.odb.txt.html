A thousand cigarettes up off the floor
Doin push-ups, all that bullshhhh
Yo I'm tryin to (SLAM!)
I just wanna give a shout, to all the jails everywhere
Cause you know, I know it's a game (Just SLAM!)
YaknowhatI'msayin?  The government got a game
Get all the brothers locked down
(This one, is a hit, it's called SLAM!)
But it ain't like that baby!

Yo, yo bust thissssssss! Yo white boy don't you got a shadow?
Black boy don't you got teeth, what the fuck is the beef?
Some tame buck nigga in the movie, said a little poetry
Had some problems with the cops, cause his man gun was hot
And of course, fuck that red tape
(*gavel pounds three times* "Guilty!!")

[Coolio]
I gotta spit at y'all, they runnin some shit on y'all
Or should I say yes, cause I'm still on the bus
So y'all is really me it's just, y'all is already you
I hereby do declare, all of us is we
Quit your silly-ass games and, petty-ass dirts see and put
greed to the side for good

[Coolio]
We live in a society created by an empire
that's based on terror, welcome to the One World Era
A complete interruption to your lil' paultry ass life
that you thought you was livin, and what you been given
No more Benzes to roll in, fat-ass stacks of money
Cause ain't no such thing as money
I bet y'all niggaz think it's funny
Put your money where your mouth or where your mouth used to be
Cause ain't shit on this planet, or in this life for free
We gonna do it like Osirus and The Warriors in the dark
Get your niggaz and my niggaz and some mo' niggaz
and have a meeting in the park!

[ODB]
Lost in the sauce, cause you think you got force
Get this across, there is only ONE boss
A NUH got it locked down, while NUH be dumbfound
and got alllll on the surrounnnnnd!!
Who you think own the ships planes and trains?
Now you got a white man's name!
