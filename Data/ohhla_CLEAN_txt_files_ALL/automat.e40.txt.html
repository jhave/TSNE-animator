[Chorus]
(Kokane &amp; E-40)
Automatic, Systematic
Do what you do playa
Just keep that money on ya mi-i-ind, (on ya mind)
In the traffic, Baller status, (baller status)
Do what you do playa, (what you do)
Just keep on hustlin' on the gri-i-ind, (on the grind)

[Verse 1]
(E-40)
???, Stackin' my mil
Avoidin' the law, Stayin' out of jail
Possesion of sales, Pocket all sales
Conspiracy charges, Hate betrayals
Payin' the rent
Cause I don't write nothin down I keep it all in my head, Intellegent
About my business, Memory like an elephant
Chasin' the dream, Suit up for cream
Special represented tactics team, They out for teams
And infared beams, Pointed at domes, backs, and spleens
Fire hydrons, Ambulance sirens, Spittin' licence, Police indicements
Rightiously what it all boils down to is basically who's the wisest
Ughhh, My heart made of granite
Slow down my spit so you squares can understand it
I didnt come in here empty handed
I came in here on business and yall gone retrospecit dammit
Been out the game, Did that mane
Valejeo I claim, Made the name
Feel my pain, Ghetto fame
Magazine Street hustla mane
Messin' around in the fast lane
Chevy, Cougars and Mustangs
Novas, Granadas, and Falcons
Project livin' and Public housin'

[Chorus]
(Kokane &amp; Fabolous &amp; E-40)
Automatic, Systematic
Do what you do playa
Just keep that money on ya mi-i-ind
(I got my mind on my money and my money on my mind, Ughh)
In the traffic, Baller status, (Ugh)
Do what you do playa, (what you do)
Just keep on hustlin' on the gri-i-ind, (on the grind)

[Verse 2]
(Fabolous)
Its ghetto F-A-Beezy
F-A-Sheezy, Bustas hate me cause I f'ed they breezies
Playboy, These techs spray easy
Like you don't know the hoodrat Hugh Hef play greasy
I get money on the grind
So if you ya mind on my money, I put some money on ya mind
Ya honey gone be mine
Cause ya diamond forecast is partly cloudly
The kids look sunny on the shine
I'm gettin' ticked off again
Ya'll must like ridin' in long black caddy's that they stick coffins in
The Click often been
Blowin' sticky, That come in the jars that they stick coffee in
I got chicks offerin'
But I play hard to get, Unless they suck me 'til my dick soft again
You lookin' at the way the coast to coast g do it
From the Brooklyn to the Bay
Bring the hook in by the way

[Chorus]
(Kokane &amp; E-40)
Automatic, Systematic
Do what you do playa
Just keep that money on ya mi-i-ind, (on ya mind)
In the traffic, Baller status, (baller status)
Do what you do playa, (what you do)
Just keep on hustlin' on the gri-i-ind, (on the grind)
To all you playas out there hustlin', (hustli-i-in)
And all my thugs that be thuggin', (thuggi-i-in)
To all you playas out there hustlin', (out there hustli-i-in)
And all my thugs that be thuggin', (thuggi-i-in)

[Verse 3]
(Fabolous)
It don't matter if you lokin' or bleedin'
Wheather its backwards or zig zags ya smokin' ya weed in
You slow pokin' or speedin'
All that counts to these motherfuckers is if you broke or suceedin'
I'm gettin used to strokin' and sweetin', pokin' and skeetin'
Stayin focused while feedin', so I don't choke what im eatin'
I'm lookin' for towns to put the coke and the weed in
To sit with white folks in a meetin', pleasebaleaveit
(E-40)
I used to sell tapes up out my truck and slang cain, (boom)
Respected on the streets before the fame, (boom)
Aint nothin' lame or game goofy about my game, (boom)
Paid my dues, Obeyed the rules
Stuck to the script, Made a Click
All a my fellows and all a my dawgs
Ridin' mustard and mayonaise on vouges
Feelin' em up, Sittin' em down
Flossin' and Bossin' all over the town
Hardest state benzes ya ever heardin ya life man write that down
(write that down)

[Chorus]
(Kokane &amp; E-40)
Automatic, Systematic
Do what you do playa
Just keep that money on ya mi-i-ind, (on ya mind)
In the traffic, Baller status, (baller status)
Do what you do playa, (what you do)
Just keep on hustlin' on the gri-i-ind, (on the grind)
To all you playas out there hustlin', (hustli-i-in)
And all my thugs that be thuggin', (thuggi-i-in)
To all you playas out there hustlin', (out there hustli-i-in)
And all my thugs that be thuggin', (thuggi-i-in)</pre>
