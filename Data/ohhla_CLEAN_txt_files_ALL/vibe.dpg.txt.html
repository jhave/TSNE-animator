[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Check this out baby girl
There's a few things I wanna explain to you, ya know
Now if you gon' be with me we gotta vibe together
Now that word means a whole lot to me
Now what I mean by that, it's simple as this
You gotta open up your head
Matter of fact, open up your mind
And let me put my head inside of your head
So you can think like me
and move like me and vibe like me
You know what I'm talkin' bout?

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
You can smoke, you can roll
You can move, you can groove
You can drink, you can ride
You can vibe with a pimp
You can bounce, you can tip
You can slip, you can ride
You can shake, you can slide
You can vibe with a pimp

[Kurupt]
You can vibe with a pimp, ride with a pimp
Dip when I dip, come by my crib
Post with a playa, let me show you what it is
I don't really want too much mama, just a little bit
I came to give you want you want mama, wait a little bit
Got this place I gotta get to, I'ma tell you what it is
You can roll, you can post, we can ride up on the coast
Just post with your folks, just vibe with a pimp
See what I see, she said I'm G'd up, I said I'm guilty
Now run up in the spot girl and throw on somethin' silky
Bad to the bone, pure redbone
Vibe with a playa, and show me what you're made of
Ridin' with the all chrome D's on the Brougham
Out to get the paper, sparklin' like my Dana's
Wide with the all gold hundred-spokes on
G'd as I wanna be, can't you see what I see?

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
You can smoke, you can roll
You can move, you can groove
You can drink, you can ride
You can vibe with a pimp
You can bounce, you can tip
You can slip, you can ride
You can shake, you can slide
You can vibe with a pimp

[Daz Dillinger]
C'mon and ride with a gangsta mack
Pimp, dip, slide with this
C'mon Snoop git, blaze that shit
We got these hoes mesmerized
Hypnotized, blowin' they mind
A real nigga like this hard to find
Fuck a smile, give me some money bitch, give it to daddy
In a 645 to a '7-trey Caddy
Got 'em ringin' my phone, they won't leave me alone
Stand on it just like a rock, I'll break 'em hard as a stone
Conversation, illustration, plus a whole lot of patience
I'll have yo' bitch ass sittin' at the bus station
It's pimpin', my money hold me down, I ain't limpin'
Everything I got is on these motherfuckin' bitches
I can gorilla and smooth mack her, dick will slap her
Professionalism, bitch this ain't no actor
Realer than real, it's hard in the field
You got to have skills to pay a pimp's bills

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
You can smoke, you can roll
You can move, you can groove
You can drink, you can ride
You can vibe with a pimp
You can bounce, you can tip
You can slip, you can ride
You can shake, you can slide
You can vibe with a pimp</pre>
