Yeah, Suburban Noize, those Kottonmouth Kings 
Freaks come out at night, the freaks come out... 

Well...  we're the freaks of the industry
Suburban Noize, Kottonmouth Kings 
The freaks of the industry
and when ya see us back stage be prepared to G 

Now they say that birds do it, bees do it
Time to freak, Saint Dog gets to it 
Not a heavy weight, but I'll go twelve rounds
With a jab of the stick, I'm going lick for lick
So give me the helmet, I'll be the stunt man 
Just relax, and I won't front like arena
I mean to get the cream of the crop 
And I'll be taking it slow, never missing a spot
Yes caress your back n chest 
You're kissing on my nose ring, I'll whisper in your ear 
Saint Dog Kottonmouth King
Oh big ST that's what you'll be screaming and  creaming 
But its not a wet dream its the real
The freaky dog, dog nasty
Never letting a kitty cat get past me
without picking it up, petting it, teasing it
Taking 3 home and pleasing it 

We're the freaks of the industry
Suburban Noize, Kottonmouth Kings 
The freaks of the industry
and when ya see us back stage be prepared to G 

Say you're G-in, nobody else is seeing 
And the freak that your with's in front of you
Bending over naked as she's leaning on the dresser
Boo-yeah!  You're looking at her from the rear 
She looks just like Rebecca, not Rebecca with the singing career 
But the X rated video queen, ya know what I mean? 
All right here's the scene, you're lying on your back 
With your head on the edge of the bed 
The booty's 2 feet from your head, should you 
A. take the time to find a condom
B. walk right over and you pound em 
C. tell her that you want her love
well the answer is D. all of the above 
So you're freakin, the furniture's squeakin, she's tweaking, 
Saying that she's weak in the knees, cheek for cheek, 
and pound for pound 
I'm taxing it and waxing it and working it around 
Till the booty starts making that clapping sound 
Which is cool but your friends are chillin in the other room 
The clap is getting louder, you don't want them to clown you 
In this situation, what do you do? 
A. plainly simply back up off her 
B. you hit it just a little bit softer 
C. you take it out and put it in her butt 
Well this for Daddy X yo, yo listen up 
I put a towel on the floor by the 2 inch gap under the door 
And now ya can't see me anymore, to the lock to the top, 
But they can't listen, there'll be no barging in, there'll be no dissin 
Get back to the mission, broke out the whip cream and the cherry 
I go through all the 5 positions
my head under her leg under my arm under her toe 
She says I like it when you scream, Daddy let yourself go,
I hit it, slid it, lick it, quit it
After the ride I put my clothes on I walk outside
And before anybody has a chance to speak I say 
Yo I'm Daddy X; I guess I'm just a freak 

We're the freaks of the industry
Suburban Noize, Kottonmouth Kings 
The freaks of the industry
and when ya see us back stage be prepared to G </pre>
