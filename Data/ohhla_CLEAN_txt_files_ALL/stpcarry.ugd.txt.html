[Intro: Ebony Burke]
I know you think you struggling
And everything looks bad
Over the hug, you can't get
And that just makes you mad
Can't trust the man beside you
And got no real true friends
Keep waiting on the day
When all your drama's gonna end

[Chorus: Ebony Burke]
Stop, look and listen
Life, is a blessing
Stop, all your stressing
You'll, find what's missing
Just carry on, just carry on, just carry on

[U-God]
Life's so short, but I'm suppose to do it
Sit back, relax and enjoy the view
Smell the fresh air, the morning dew
Let the sunshine come beaming through
Broken rules, beneath the crimes
We all god's creatures, the streets is mine
Forget your stress, release your mind
Take all your worries, leave 'em all behind
Now, peep my rhyme and you see my cause
We all got problems, we all got flaws
We all got heartaches, we all got sores
Just make sure you take care of you and yours

[Chorus]

[U-God]
I got jewels for the mind, more fruit to eat
You are exceptional, you are unique
You are truly special, to be on earth
You are really blessed, it can be more worse
Now feel my hurt, hear my lions roar
Reach for your dreams and try to soar
Push through the door, the lord's thy sheppard
Lean on the shoulders, when times is hectic
People got problems, try to accept it
No food to eat, baby need pampers
People in the world need cures for cancer
I got questions, I need answers

[Chorus]

[U-God]
This one right here, I compose this lyric
For your self esteem, to up lift your spirit
Take my kindness for weakness, and you try to smear it
All you dumb, deaf and blinds, ain't trynna to hear it
It's the jealousy, envy, lust and greed
Care less for what ya want, or more of what you need
And it's hard to believe and have faith in people
When you stuck in the battle over good and evil

[Chorus]

[Outro: U-God]
Yo, don't worry ya head, sweetheart
Everything is gonna work out fine
If it was meant for you to have it
You'll have it, don't give up ya dreams, never
Ever, ever, give up ya dreams, keep on pushing</pre>
