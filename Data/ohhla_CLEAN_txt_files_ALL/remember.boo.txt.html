Ha haaaa
Boosie Bad Azz

Hah Hah
Look Look

Now when I'm gone 
You gone remember me
For everything I said in songs
Everybody who I feed was hungry (Good Hearted)
For tha family, tha kids, tha homies
For all these niggas and bitches hatin' on me
So when I'm gone you gon remember me
From Baton Rouge, to Tenneessee, to Italy
To guarantee when I'm gone they gone remember
Da Coogi sweaters da fresh fade da sense of humor
Da heart of gold da bad side and all da rumors
Remember daddy love ya, that's to all my kids
Momma I gotta go fo you that's just the way it is
Guess da haters gone hate my kids
I can see it know
Tootie and his lil brother cold blooded
Might be 30
Might be 50
Might be 80 mane
Want my six figures, niggas a take me to my grave mane
Already know how I wanna go
But it aint my time
Never thought I'd see a couple mill fo 25
That's why I'm legendary 
I'm rocking these shows
Every label I was wit
I carried the load
Remember my flow remember my voice
Remember everything I rap mane
I spoke from the heart

Chorus

So when I'm gone they gone remember me
For everything I said in songs
Everybody who I feed was hungry 
For tha family, tha kids, tha homies
For all these niggas and bitches hatin' on me
But When I'm gone they gone remember me
For what, for stay being G'd up
For lifting up people
For my diabetes
For keeping it real when all my niggas went commercial
Thank you in, when you smell purple
So when I'm gone they gone remember me

Check this out
If a pussy nigga starch me out
Do you know how many niggas
Running up in yo house
Killing mamas killing babies I can see it know
Niggas can't even smoke purple
All they know is murder
Remember my struggle
Remember how long it took to bubble
Hugged my sister and my brother
Same for my mother
Every penny that or more 
Make sure my kids straight
Tell 'em stories keep smiles on my kids face
Cause I'm gone be in my own section like Pac
But I speak ??? every time that I drop
Remember how I used to handle the rocks
And stop and pop
Remember me the mane man on the block
Let the hoes that used to know
From way before
Kiss me from my head to my toes fo sho
Remember my cars my shining pieces
My long fight wit diabetes
Mane

Chorus</pre>
