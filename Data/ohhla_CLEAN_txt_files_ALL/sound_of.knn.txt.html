Song:   The Sound of My Breaking Heart
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Bombs are falling on me since you been gone
Shook my world feels like it's armageddon
It's not a earthquake ake or tsunami
What you hear is the sound of my breaking heart
The sound of my breaking heart
The sound of my breaking heart

There's nothing good at all
In saying goodbye
I look, I lie but dying inside
I win I smile I dance for my cry eyes

Boomerang let it send
If it's real it will vent
Come around with the wind
Tell me this is in the end
I'll be waiting everyday
There's a will, there's a way
Love look what you, you done to me

Bombs are falling on me since you been gone
Shook my world feels like it's armageddon
It's not a earthquake ake or tsunami
What you hear is the sound of my breaking heart
The sound of my breaking heart
The sound of my breaking heart

There's nothing sweet at all
About my sweetheart I hit a wall
I'm falling apart
Win lose or drag there's no luck in my cards

Boomerang let it send
If it's real it will vent
Come around with the wind
Tell me this is in the end
I'll be waiting everyday
There's a will, there's a way
Love look what you, you done to me

Bombs are falling on me since you been gone
Shook my world feels like it's armageddon
It's not a earthquake ake or tsunami
What you hear is the sound of my breaking heart
The sound of my breaking heart
The sound of my breaking heart

Shattered glass to the floor
Feel my pain now remorse
Battle cry, we're at war
Till I'm gone hear me roar
Shattered glass to the floor
Feel my pain now remorse
Battle cry, we're at war
Till I'm gone hear me roar

Bombs are falling on me since you been gone
Shook my world feels like it's armageddon
It's not a earthquake ake or tsunami
What you hear is the sound of my breaking heart
The sound of my breaking heart
The sound of my breaking heart</pre>
