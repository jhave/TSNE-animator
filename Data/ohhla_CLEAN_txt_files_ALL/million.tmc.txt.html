(Baby) (T-Mac) 
50 ain't shit, shoot the dice lil' daddy 
Yeah nigga', 263, Cash Money 
50 ain't shit, shoot the dice lil' daddy 
That shit to the death on the for-reala' 
50 ain't shit, shoot the dice lil' daddy 
Playboy, hell of shit, that shit gravy 
50 ain't shit........ 
Nigga' Rolex diamond infested 
Nigga', nigga' wassup 

(T - Mac) 
470 with that 99 black Bentley 
A seven-figurenaire at 24 with much women 
My lil' son Lil' T stay jeweled down 
Shit he even got two broads in the Charlie-Town 
But peep this out I'm playin' with bigger and better thangs 
This got that hovercraft the other day, shit I'm ballin' 
Playboy you lookin' at my Rollie, shit you want it 
I throw five away and buy ten another day 
Yeah nigga' all these gold and rubies on my teeth 
I keep my sweetheart on platinum down in the passenger seat 
German cars with Italian suits (humm) 
Gold buckle on my motherfuckin' gator boots 
Five platinum cards in my gator wallet 
I keep dem' broads geekin' like some fuckin' alcoholics 
Twenty inches steady flickin', diamonds steady blingin' 
Shit I'm buying up all kinda' shit like a mad man 
I bought my two daughters a Lexus 300 
They only six and eight and I buy them a drivers licensee 
Dom P and Cristal ain't shit to us 
Done made my own champagne.. T-Mizy-Rosy-Plus 
Dem' bezels cost enough for me to fuck ten niggas wife 
See a nigga' took his life cause' T-Mac fucked his wife 
Niggas call me a home wrecker 
Shit I tell em' look here boy I'mma reality checker 
In case these cars and broads and diamonds and shit ain't real 
Playboy take me out tomorrow, twenty inch deals 
Woodgrain and tweeters everywhere 
Shit, eight 12's in the back to knock out a bitch ear 

(Baby)	(T-Mac)

Stack me some g's and keep rollin' on the city streets 
Totin' heat, in case a nigga' wanna see 
Is these niggas that I fuck with really down for me? 
Makaveli got my back, with a tool thats an AK 
Quick to spray and bust a nigga' head any day 
I hustle on my block so my youngsters don't get popped 
I buy new cars so my hoes can shop 
50 ain't shit shoot the dice lil' daddy 
You can't fuck with this ridin' in a old Caddy 
You might find me in a Bentley with twenty inches 
With TVs, rollin' wit' lil' Brian lil' daddy 
Look I'm flossin' in my motherfuckin' Navigator
