[Intro - Rick Ross]
Billionaire yeah you feel me

[Hook - Trey Songz]
This is the life, this is the life
Ain't no stoppin it's champagne for poppin you ? from ?
This is the life, this is the life
Keep shit poppin these hoes they stay bobbin no stoppin us every night
This is the life, ain't no stoppin
? boppers serve it up for a hell of a price
This is the life, this is the life
This is the, this is the life

[Verse 1 - Rick Ross]
Uh I'm the man you wanna stand near
Damn near a hundred gram in jewels in my ?
Snitches stand clear can't no snichtes stand here
This reserve for them trill I'm red carpet every year
Take a picture canary stones so photogenic
No I didn't grow up with it so I had to go and get it
Started with a biscuit now I got a loaf
Hoes wanna slice I wanna tell her no
But I can't I get a rush blowin dough
I'm gettin bank I'm in a rush to blow the dough
This is the life I'm in a race to get money
This is the life I need a bad bitch to blow it for me

[Hook - Trey Songz]

This is the life, this is the life
Ain't no stoppin it's champagne for poppin you ? from ?
This is the life, this is the life
Keep shit poppin these hoes they stay bobbin no stoppin us every night
This is the life, ain't no stoppin
? boppers serve it up for a hell of a price
This is the life, this is the life
This is the, this is the life

[Verse 2 - Rick Ross]
Not that I'm arrogant I'm just extravagant
I'm a boss player check my ?
I got hoes in Memphis hoes in Maryland
White girl in Carolina let's call her Karoline
She love ballplayers hate the dope boys
'Cuz we fight dogs call me Jeff ?
Yea this the Superbowl of the street shit
It's all fast food my niggaz eat quick
When I seen a million it fucked up my life
Brand new twenty cars party for twenty nights
Fucked plenty wives crushed many lives
I wouldn't it change for the world
This is the life

[Hook - Trey Songz]
This is the life, this is the life
Ain't no stoppin it's champagne for poppin you ? from ?
This is the life, this is the life
Keep shit poppin these hoes they stay bobbin no stoppin us every night
This is the life, ain't no stoppin
? boppers serve it up for a hell of a price
This is the life, this is the life
This is the, this is the life

[Verse 3 - Rick Ross]
I'm camptin in the Hamptons
Chillin in a playstation
'Cuz I'm playin with them chips that you ain't makin
I ain't fakin trap ain't
California razors keep me feelin Jamaican
The block backin the blunt burnin
I'm in Trump Towers amongst earners
? sports for the ?
Fine lip servers for the Triple C
Words rhymin best
Can't spell well but I define success
I sell well so I make a toast
The fallen comrades hold the bottles up
We standin tall fam

[Hook - Trey Songz]
This is the life, this is the life
Ain't no stoppin it's champagne for poppin you ? from ?
This is the life, this is the life
Keep shit poppin these hoes they stay bobbin no stoppin us every night
This is the life, ain't no stoppin
? boppers serve it up for a hell of a price
This is the life, this is the life
This is the, this is the life</pre>
