No matter how hard you try, you can't stop this now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop this now

Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age for renegades
Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age for renegades

Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece 
On down through the Middle Ages
When the earth kept going through changes
There's a business going on, cars continue to change 
Nothing stays the same, there were always renegades 
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Payne 
Like Martin Luther King, Malcom X
They were renegades of the atomic age 
So many renegades

Hand clap, hand clap, the renegades 

From a different solar system many many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation 
And we're on this musical message to help the others listen 
Improve momentum and seek the electonic chance
Like astrology 
Like technology
Like God's Creation 
Like the Zulu station 
Like to the nation 
Like destroy all nations
Like militants
Like down in sand 
Like through changes ,nothing stays the same
Oh renegades

Now renegades are people with their own philosophy
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me 
You know they have their secret notions
And time is endless motion
All people of the moderate ages here in this twentieth century
You have to keep up in time with the moderate time
A state of mind and a sense of pride
A renegade, yes a renegade 
Of this time and age
So many renegades
Who's that 
Now hand clap
The renegades

We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
You know we're poppin', sockin', with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
(Repeat)

We're teachers of the funk
And not of empty popping
We're blessed with the Force and the sight of
electronics
With the bass, and the treble
The horns and our vocals
You know everytime we pop into the beat we get fresh

There was a time when our music 
Was something called the Bay Street beat
People would gather from all around
To get down on the Bay sound 
You had to be a renegade those days
To take a man on the dance floor
Like Afrika Bambattaa and the Soulsonic Force
We're talking about Mr. B, Pow Wow, G-L-O-B-E
Was a renegade, yes, a renegade of the atomic age
So many renegades
What's that
It's a hand clap
The renegade

Just jam sucker
Say jam sucker
Say groove, sucker
Say groove, sucker
Say dance, sucker
Say dance, sucker
Now move, sucker
Now move, sucker

Everybody say 
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

Shake that thing
That makes me swing
I got some great 
He's a renegade of funk 
Mr. Biggs
He's a renegade of funk 
Bambaataa
He's a renegade of funk 
Pow Wow
He's a renegade of funk
