[Lil Jon]
We gon' start this thing off right (say what?)
We got the Dirty South in the house tonight
We gon' start this thing off right (say what?)
We got the ATL in the house tonight
 
We gon' start this thing off right (say what?)
We got some sexy ladies in the house tonight
We gon' start this thing off right (say what?)
We got TLC in the house tonight
 
Chorus:
Baby, if I drop it down to the ground
Then put it in your face, now what'chu gon' do?
Shorty, if I shake it then turn around
Then back it up on ya, what'chu gon' do?
If you want some, come get some
If you want some, come get some
If you want some, come get some
If you want some, shorty come &amp; get some
 
[T-Boz]
Headin' to the club
You know I gotta get geared up
Make sure my hair looks right
Know I'm lookin' good
Wanna put my butt jeans on
Show 'em that my ass look tight
When my crew lights up
And we start doin' our strut
Wait till the beat kicks up
Don't think you really want none
But if you want some get some
 
Chorus
 
[T-Boz]
Girls from the South
Know how to turn the spot out
Feelin' soul what it's all about
Shake it in a club
Then take you out to the grub
Down at the Waffle House
In the A we get crunk
We know how to show you love
Can't nobody do it like us
Don't think you really want none
If you want some get some
 
Chorus
 
[Chilli]
If y'all don't know in the South
We keep the party jumpin'
From dusk to dawn we keep it crunk
We keep the masses bumpin'
Y'all don't want none
Y'all don't want none
But if you think you can hang with the A don't front
Come get some
 
[Sean Paul]
What's happenin', shawty?
Sean Paul from the East side
Want a grabbin' thigh baby lots'a replies
Love the way your jeans fit
'Cause your hips wide
I know you're from the South
I can tell from your back side
I'm from the slum
Let me show you how the 'Lac rides
Money ain't a thang baby
'Specially if you act right
A young stunna but I'm sure you got your own money
The only time you see me runnin' baby if them po' comin'
Shawty lookin' good do that dance
I'm pretty sure you know I know what's in them pants
I'm a G shawty give me a chance
And if you're thinkin I'll just pop it and I'll leave in advance
Oh no, shawty, I don't play
I can tell from the slang you born and raised in the A
So I'm pretty sure I know where you stay
Baby won't you hit me on the hip and I'll be headed your way
 
[Lil Jon]
Heyyyy...
Now right about now (what's up?)
We gon' break this thing down (well break it down then)
If you know how to stomp (stomp)
We need y'all to crank it on up (let's go)
Like this (like this)
 
Do the A-Town stomp!
Do the A-Town stomp!
Do the A-Town stomp!
Do the A-Town stomp!
