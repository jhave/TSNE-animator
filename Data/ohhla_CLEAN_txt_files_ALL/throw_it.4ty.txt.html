[Intro: Snoop Dogg] + (Roger Troutman in backround)
Yeeah, throw it up throw it up, (what what?)
Eastside (what what?), Dogg Pound, what what what what? (what?)
Yeeah, Snoop Dogg up in there, what up, what up? yeeah... D.P.G

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Dogg from the "Beach" Eastside on mine
I'm striking through the hood
While I'm slanging my goods
I'm hollaring at my folks (what up?), rolling up some dope
4-Tay from the Bay they say we West Coast folks, you know (you know)
We can't be nothing but that (but that)
And when you bust we bust right back
No play, 4-Tay tell them about the Dogg
I dip to the Bay then get the money y'all
I catch a plane with the gang, purple on my brain
That nigga, that nigga done done it again
Still my nigga, for real my nigga
D.P.G.C. it's a big deal my nigga
Wherever we go we represent the turf until it hurt
Long Beach niggaz will rush you to the dirt (nigga)
Eastsidaz, real riders
Throw it up like you know it up, throw it up

[Chorus (1): Tray Deee] + (Roger Troutman)
Throw it up, yeah (oooh ooooooh oooh, throw it up!)
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up
All the homies on the Eastside where the G's ride
Do your thug thing homie, throw it up (throw it up, oooh ooooooh oooh)
All the homies on the West Side, yeah (throw it up!)
All the homies on the West Side (throw it up!) throw it up throw it up
Throw it up throw it up, do your thug thing

[Verse 2: Rappin' 4-Tay]
Pressure bust pipes, we bust raps
Niggaz don't want funk cause we bust caps
Get off in the zone then I'm in and blaze up
You ain't about your cheese I'd advise you to raise up
Cowards can't kick it cause the game don't mix right
That's like bringing a butter knife to a gun fight
I kick it with the sickest from the Bay to L.A
We get the figures, squeeze them triggers if you stepping our way
4-Tay from the Sco (San Francisco) with Snoop D-O double
Players, gangsters, hustlers, you motherfuckers in trouble
Critically acclaimed, this men is his nemesis, ain't no end to this
My mind playing tricks on me - I'm seeing images
Fish tailing, inhaling, bailing, positive suspension
Don't hate on a player cause I'm staying on a mission
Nigga, get yours hit the billboards and bust
For Roger Troutman, we gone give it up, we gone throw it up

[Chorus (2): Tray Deee] + (Roger Troutman)
Throw it up, yeah (oooh ooooooh oooh, throw it up!)
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up
All the homies on the Eastside where the G's ride
Do your thug thing homie, throw it up (throw it up, oooh ooooooh oooh)
All the homies on the West Side, yeah (throw it up!)
All the homies on the West Side (throw it up!) throw it up throw it up
Throw it up throw it up, do your thug thing
Throw it up, all my homies on the South Side yeah, get live get live
Throw it up throw it up, throw it up
All my homies on the North, throw it up throw it up
Yeah just throw it up, throw it up throw it up throw it up
(Throw it up throw it up throw it up...)

[Verse 3: Tray Deee]
I keep it sparking, heat is barking, daylight to darkness
Known for doing wrong, getting ours regardless
We come up out the ghetto, never settle for chump change
We out there running things doing our thug thing
Game recognize and I been checking mine
Gang of suckers try, get them lame second tries
We G'd up, C'd up sipping, blazing weed up
Haters steady playing but ain't ready yet to see us
We bust big caps, restless with your chit-chat
Player, where your chips at?, broke?, you better fix that
If you ain't a hustler you must of been a buster
It's all about who falling out the game and who running
Done it all like a hog calling the dogs
Never sleep, never slip and not often I pause
Tray Deee, way G, known to flow and blow it up
And make everybody in the party throw it up

[Chorus (2): Tray Deee] + (Roger Troutman)

[Outro: Tray Deee]
Rest in peace Roger Troutman, this for you homie
All y'all throw it up</pre>
