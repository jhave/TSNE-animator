Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Triple six, five, forked tongue
Subatomic penetration rapid fire through your skull
How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control
Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight, what its like to experience - Takyon

Out of the blue, in through the back
Door coming through like fuck what was that
Man I don't know, but it made me feel so heated
How we creep without showing you jack
Shit from below, give a shit if you know
Cuz even if you did, you'd keep coming back
Back for more, need it man you're addicted to the heat
We make beats catch
Beat it til it bleeds to death, each track
Like EPMD snappin necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map

Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight what its like to experience - Takyon

Takyon, shot down your throat like a keg of beer
Choke on the smoke we in and exhale til the whole chamber is clear
Haters act so fucking weird
Try to stain this atmosphere
But they can't cuz its way too sheer
How to make a hater disappear

Take shit where it ain't never been
Fuck what you thought could not comprehend
This shit if I fisted your brain with it
10-9-8-7-triple 6-5-forked tongue
Criminal level crunk lightning storm
Get out the way or get up torn
Ain't a picture big enough to fit
What we dig up from the core
Of all that they forgot ever was
Militant march of this war

Takyon - taking them down
All we see is blood
Takyon - turning them out
How to trick out and freak that buzz

Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight what its like to experience - Takyon

Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip
Off the moonlit fire we spray
Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste
So here's the deal, if you don't feel ill
Don't want it nowhere near my zone
That shit is dead, can't nobody get
With that shit gets dial toned

Takyon - bitch slappin pussy clots and clones
Takyon - settin off unibombs inside your dome

Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight what its like to experience - Takyon</pre>
