Yea
Hey
It's your boy Fat Al
Hey. This song right here, know what I'm sayin'
For all my niggas that be comin' down
You comin' down and you play this song right here, I don't care who behind
you...the police
I don't give a fuck, the doors should be open
You need to be swangin', this how we do it in Cleveland

Hey
It's the Fat Al
And I'm from the slab
First nigga put 28's on the jag
20's on the Lac
24's on the cuddy
Pull up in the brown car look like a nutty butty
Now I got some buddies that love the cap and
They love the Fat Al just because the nigga rap
Nigga stay strap and I ain't talkin' about a gun
Look when I stop, how my rims just run
Niggas comin' up some niggas comin' down
Look at the tall trucks got surround sound
If you talkin' down then u get a beat down
Stop Sprewell spinnin' then I'm clappin' on you clowns
I am a winner far from a sinner
Look how I stop oh blind by my spinners
Look at the man better make a killin' man
When I stop 28's look like a ceiling fan

I done came down
I done came down
I done
I done
I done
I done
I done came down
I done came down
I done came down
I done
I done
I done
I done
I done came down
Niggas hate me now
Cause I done came down
I done
I done
I done
I done
I done came down
I done came down
I done came down
I done
I done
I done
I done
I done came down

Pull up in the Sunday these boys can't top it
Paint is vanilla while my seats is dark chocolate
When it comes to cappin' you niggas switch the topic
When it comes to this rappin' they know that I'm the hottest
Tryin' to make a profit boy you better stop it
Touch my hustle man these niggas can't knock it
I'm in the droppin' matter fact I'm mobbin'
Trunk hit so hard that I thought I did a drop kick
Look at the pie you know I'm a shine
Nigga riddin' in the cuddy with my nigga vibe
I said the cuddy don't forget bout E
Cause he comin' down slidin' in a grand prix
Earn got the Monty C and Mike got the 8 ball
Phil slide backwards that mean we got bars
Nigga hate on ya'll I think naw
Matter fact when I stop I get applause

(Repeat Hook)

Niggas from the 4 they be comin' down
Niggas from Detroit they be comin' down
Niggas from the 17th they be comin' down
Niggas from the 5 they be comin' down
Niggas from the Oh Shape they be comin' down
Niggas from Seta they be comin' down
Niggas from Superior they be comin' down
Niggas from Kansas they be comin' down
Niggas comin' down from ATL to H-Town
Niggas comin' down them Chevy boys is comin' down
Cadillac Gang man they be comin' down
Niggas from C-Town man we stay comin' down
They pop at H-Town but round here we swang doors
Niggas comin' down plus we ridin' on 4's
Nigga told you before nigga swinging doors
I don't give a fuck dog we stay gleamin'
Oh I told 'em
