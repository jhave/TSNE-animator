Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
You niggaz actin like you can't beat
You niggaz like it like it ain't me
See acting like y'all niggaz can't see
You motherfuckers all should thank me
You welcome, motherfuckers! {*4X*}

We let you talkin next snow, nigga bring that shit back
Gotta step in gotta flay then you know it's that bad
If he want my last 9 I'm a let that 9 go
If the nigga want it hard I'm a whip that nice slow
Nigga taking my time, nigga I ain't in no rush
Man you nigga know the deal my money longer than a bus
Man you nigga know the deal my choppers longer than a bitch
We hop up I pop your ass and even help me dig a ditch
If the nigga stay talking to the folks then he a snitch
If the niggaz stay going to the bank then nigga rich
If the nigga stay reading up the nigga on the shit
If we meet the day before tonight then I don't know the bitch

[Chorus]
You niggaz actin like you can't beat
You niggaz like it like it ain't me
See acting like y'all niggaz can't see
You motherfuckers all should thank me
You welcome, motherfuckers! {*4X*}

I said, all hail the young rich and eater of the plate
Broke the whole thing down left the paper full of shake
If you know it that mean that's a problem full of crumb
And you know what that mean, that's a trap full of bum
And you know what that mean that's a pocket full of cash
Say you want the same thing so I went up in this game
Don't be playing with my money if you do I'm gonna blast
Nigga thought of sweet here you know I had to last
If you smoke a hundred swishers everyday that swisher light
If you keep your 40 cal. everyday that's pistol light
If you set that white body everyday that crystal light
Know some niggaz keep that car key griming kryptonite

[Chorus]
You niggaz actin like you can't beat
You niggaz like it like it ain't me
See acting like y'all niggaz can't see
You motherfuckers all should thank me
You welcome, motherfuckers! {*4X*}</pre>
