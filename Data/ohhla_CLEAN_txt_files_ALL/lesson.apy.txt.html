[Apathy]
I'll make you motherfuckers break out like soda and grease
Devoted to speech and how it flows over the beats
We're rollin' deep holdin' heat like the code of the streets
Reloadin' my piece while faggot rappers go to police
Yo I use more force than even Yoda can teach
Try to counter my opponents but the total decreased
Flows released until every last foe is deceased
Build a throne from the bones of the bogus and weak
So if you ever pickup a mic to beef or to diss
You'll cease to exist before the metal reaches your lips
The reason is this: picture gettin' Jesus to spit
Multiply by six and you'll get me when I flip
Walk exotic beaches with bitches who fiend for the dick
They get exotic, freaky, and viscous, and eager to lick
Let my foes roll deep, bring toast to the beef
Fuck bullets, I could catch lightening bolts in my teeth
It's Apathy, the baddest rapper with the mentality
That's as savage as survivors of a nuclear disaster
Aftermath's as massive as asteroid crashes
Frontin' like your bad when half your boys passive
I pass that six-way shit, play slick
I'll be up inside your nose on some switchblade shit
Writing (?) style motherfuckers better be listening
I start spittin' and leave your brain like Jessica Simpson
Fresh in the flesh, now-a-days I'm better at pimpin'
Gettin' every single chicken, tryin' every single position
I'm top seated
Burn your stomach lining like there's crack rocks in your pocket and
You see the cops heated
Cannot be defeated
It's not an option I treat it like it's pussy, get it poppin' anytime
That I need it
If a bitch ain't wifey and she like me or I beat it
Then she's likely to describe me as being slightly conceited
The type to type your number in my phone and then delete it
Leave it alone, if you ain't givin' me dome then I don't need it
I got kinky hoes in skimpy clothes
With brain powers that could crack Da Vinci codes</pre>
