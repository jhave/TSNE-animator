Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

* I'm not entirely sure which guest rapper did which verse

[Intro/Chorus]
Whim, wham, thank you ma'am
Ayyeah, I won't mind off the top, cut the check
Done done, done did it what's next
Cut the check, dope boy slash rapper slash exec
Cut the check, I really lived the life
Niggaz look up to me, I am the sky
Clouds... yeah I'm so fly
Screamin Bankhead 'til the day I die

[Braski]
You lookin at the trap in its flesh, rap at its best
Bankhead nigga, Front Street is next
Don't hate me, nigga hate the game
I did it for the money, you did it for the change
Ayyyy! I'm a real go getter
Lo told me, Front Street, go get 'em
Two in the babe made me the babysitter
Got my eggbeater, now I'm fin' to go whimper
Yeah, I got crack on shiver
If the money right hell yeah I'll deliver
Deuce in the quarter, hook the wheel like Skipper
AC blowin and it feel like winter

[Chorus]

[Lil Mark]
I won't stop, I cain't stop
Baby girl I need mine off top (cut the check)
God damn right, I'm with the man right?
And this what money really look like (cut the check)
I got paper like Kinko's
And Shawty got 'em for the L-O
This ain't a Honda, get you a two do'
And 800, get you an elbow (yeah)
I got 'em dancin like Fabo
They geaked up cause I'm cheap like Maaco
Yes sir, I made moves for the peso
So they gotta cut the check when I say so

[Chorus]

[Shawty Lo]
I need mine pimp, just get him on the phone
I'm the man's Don, just call me Corleone
Tell them other niggaz, they better leave me alone
Bankhead nigga, but I'm from Bowen Homes
Yeahhhh, what's really goin on?
Ye ain't heard of him? I'm sittin on the throne
King, ayy, that's what's goin on
Me a stuntin man? You heard it in the song

[Chorus]</pre>
