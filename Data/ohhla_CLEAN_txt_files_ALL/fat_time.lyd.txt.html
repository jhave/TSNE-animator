[Intro]
Yeeah! I hear you!
NOW I'M A MAKE YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!

[Chorus]
They see me movin, they want me to stop, drop
Off the face of Earth but, I'm a make it pop, hot
These niggas are not, now, watch me take my spot, got
Money got, power and respect, baby I just hope
Time's on my side, I've been tryin, all my life
Every block, someone's dyin
Always high, here's our life, come inside

[Verse One]
Energy's my ammunition, like AK shells
So think about that when you plan on dissin, go straight to hell! 
Bred to be ballin since a baby kickin, I had to smell
{*Sniffs*}Brand new money ladies sniffin, you take a L
I take a shit on rappers all it's worth, can't die over must conquer the world first
Like a monster to media on my beautiful girls search
High and low I am no thing you tamper with
Made the plan you should cancel it make examples I trample shit
Drop you here I am cancerous answer this who can handle this?!
Scandalous I dismantles these ants and piss on a trucer
You think I seen the future how I wham, quick recouper
Fire hand, wham, turn a brand new man, big producer
Uh! Gift from heaven livin legend and I come from Queens
Robbin leggin.3-5-7 in my fuckin jeans!
Sufferin and fucked up schemes twin Bentleys
Matchin Beamers or a couple beams try my sentencin

[Chorus]
They see me movin, they want me to stop, drop
Off the face of Earth but, I'm a make it pop, hot
These niggas are not, now, watch me take my spot, got
Money got, power and respect, baby I just hope
Time's on my side, I've been tryin, all my life
Every block, someone's dyin
Always high, here's our life, come inside

[Verse Two]
Uh! Murdered half of y'all on my mixtapes, come rapped up in my wrath
Now I'm laughin look at ya rib cage, ya ass been in a slump
Cum blastin all in ya bitch face, success is what they want
Tongue lashin will get ya shit sprayed, have it how you want!
Blood bath I'm as sharp as switchblades
You'll be smilin for life love flashin I got the shit made
Forget where I'm at now, I passed 'em around the sixth grade 
Passion for my profession outlast anyone you could name
Hood fame got me ridin in wood grain look lame Staten, Harlem to Brooklyn
They know I'm cooked 'caine took aim rappin would bang
I could change but this sport ain't a good game I'm strappin
Back seat in the passenger, semi auto massacre
Shoppin while I laugh at ya, rappers feed my appetite
Metaphors'll tackle ya, these niggas ain't half as nice
Playboy in my afterlife, real nigga with cash and ice
Drop the bread, pass the dice, hope I crack twice

[Chorus]
They see me movin, they want me to stop, drop
Off the face of Earth but, I'm a make it pop, hot
These niggas are not, now, watch me take my spot, got
Money got, power and respect, baby I just hope
Time's on my side, I've been tryin, all my life
Every block, someone's dyin
Always high, here's our life, come inside</pre>
