[Tunji]
I'm sick and tired of dwellin' in the past, so I'm tellin' 'em the facts
See, I started on my journey and I'm settled on the path
My songs are from the soul although I'm sellin' em for cash
Dedicated to my homeys and my relatives that passed
....let's take a moment for their lost souls
If life's a road then I'm just swervin' through the potholes
If death is silent, then I'm livin' in surround sound
Speakers blastin' while maneuverin' through downtown
Feelin' like this is exactly what I live for
I wanna take less, I wanna give more
We came a long way from hand-me-downs and thrift stores
And it's like no matter what, success is what we drift towards
I wanna write my name across the night sky
'Cause I saw my future in the stars and let the lights guide
Sittin' back and countin' money as the price rise
Said I couldn't do it, but I always saw the bright side

[Kno/Tunji]
So even when I feel down, down
I keep looking ahead because I'm here now, now

[Kno]
I'm here now
Theres nothin to fear now
One day you will die
So I am killin it year round
Fuck a bucket list
I have had enough of it
Stuck off in a rut cus Lady Luck is such a summabitch
But that slut can suck a dick
For sustenence
I'ma fuck it up a bit
Chuck me the rock Ima tuck and run with it
Plus I'm havin fun with it
In a zone passin all the tests
And now I'm playin bones and I'm gamblin with death
The best 2 out of 3, 3 out of 5, 4 out of 7
A Bogus Journey until you going to Heaven
I always know where I'm headin
Cus I know where I been
Tell Mother Nature she can blow in the wind
And choke on my kids
Middle finger to Father Time while I'm holdin my dick
I'm takin life slowly homey and I'm soakin it in
Middle finger to Father Time while I'm holdin my dick
I'm takin life slowly homie cus I'm nowhere near the end

[Kno/Tunji]
So even when I feel down, down
I keep looking ahead because I'm here now, now

So even when I feel down, down
I keep looking ahead because I'm here now, now</pre>
