Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
You know what's real funny?
A lot of the niggaz we used to look up to, is lookin up to us now
See that's that astronaut status, nigga
DJ scream my nigga Future

[Chorus]
I'ma spaz on y'all (astronaut nigga. Saluters respect that)
We got to spaz on y'all, cuz a million mother fuckers wanna see me fall
I'm the strength of my hood, I'ma spaz on y'all
Got a real bad bitch come whenever I call
It's so hard for me to trust her, I can't give her my all
Got a gang of bitches in the club from wall to wall
I'ma get em by the stage then I'ma spaz on y'all
I'm bout to spaz on y'all

I'm on my rockstar campaign, eyes it's ours boy
Money just to burn, like a fire in a forrest
Holding on a card trick, hundred page magazine
Sippin on codeine so I can make my thoughts clean
I swear if it ain't calm my nerves, I click on niggaz (click on niggaz!)
I had a issue (what?)
I'm too ambitious (too ambitious!)
I paint the picture (what?)
It's very vivid (you see it?)
I play to guard the devil, don't get a hole in my spirit
Try to wash my hands, I wash my hands, I had so much dirt on em (whoa)
I grind so hard (hey)
Now I'm hot as a sauna (I'm hot!)
You'd rather see me suffer (you'd rather see me suffer)
My whole team under
Applying major pressure (on you niggaz)
With no conscience

[Chorus]
We got to spaz on y'all, (why?) cuz a million mother fuckers wanna see me fall (I know!)
I'm the strength of my hood, I'ma spaz on y'all
Got a real bad bitch come whenever I call
It's so hard for me to trust her, I can't give her my all
Got a gang of bitches in the club from wall to wall
I'ma get em by the stage then go spaz on y'all
I'm bout to spaz on y'all

My body full of ganja
The recipe, the farmers
Don't make me put it on ya, I recollect your memory
Finessing was a sport, then I turned it to a business
This ain't one LBG forever, get the fuck up out my business
That crack house life, (life!) it will teach you something you can't even witness
Or listen to, you gotta go through
Feel it in your kidney
She wishing, and it's my only chance
And I got bitches, they come in on command
No remote control, on demand
You wanna see me win? I go Taliban
Ape shit behind the free band logo
We go loco on that coco, I put that on my migo

[Chorus]
We got to spaz on y'all, (why?) cuz a million mother fuckers wanna see me fall (I know)
I'm the strength of my hood, I'ma spaz on y'all
Got a real bad bitch come whenever I call
It's so hard for me to trust her, I can't give her my all
Got a gang of bitches in the club from wall to wall
I'ma get em by the stage then go spaz on y'all
I'm bout to spaz on y'all

The planet ice sphere made me colder than Ohio
I get headaches everyday but you can't tell how hard I go
I'ma give it to you real, ain't no excuses I'm making
One word gets you through the bad days, having patience
They don't have no idea, how the haters try to interfere and steal what you done built up
To this point in your career
When you riding in the rairri, swerving through traffic with your diamonds
It's one word, gliss, cuz all your shit is is remindement
Bad karma, I put in when I was grinding
Hustle hard, taking money, it's called surviving
Down bat, take your anger, then you can bind it
I go to the booth with them thoughts, then start rhyming

[Chorus]
We got to spaz on y'all, (why?) cuz a million mother fuckers wanna see me fall (I know)
Got a real bad bitch come whenever I call
It's so hard for me to trust her, I can't give her my all
Got a gang of bitches in th club from wall to wall
I'ma get em by the stage then go spaz on y'all
I'm bout to spaz on y'all</pre>
