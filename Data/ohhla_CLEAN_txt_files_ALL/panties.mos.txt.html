I just want you to
Relax
Ease into it

Baby slow down, just take your time
You and me goin' be here for a while
Okay
Baby don't rush this, take your time
You and me goin' be here for a while
Okay
I got so much that I want to do
I just want to be close to you
Okay
I got so much that I want to do
That I can show you better than I can say

I don't wanna be no where but here
No where in this atmosphere
Stratosphere, ionosphere
Ain't no sphere that's bright like here
I don't wanna be no where but here
No where in this atmosphere
I'm good where I am

Baby slow down, take your time
You and me goin' be here for a while
Okay, hey
I got so much that I want to do
I can show you better than I can say

Let me show you
Let me show you
Let me show you
Let me show you
Let me show you
I wanna show you
Let me show you
Let me show you
Let me show you

Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Come let me take you by the hand
Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me show you how
Let me show you how
Let me show you now
Let me show it out
Let me show you how
I wanna show ya how
Let me show ya
Let me show ya
Let me show ya
Let me show ya
Let me show ya
Ohh

Baby slow down just take your time
You and me goin' be here for a while
Okay, hey
I got so much that I want to do
That I can show you better than I can say

Enough talk and let's move
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on</pre>
