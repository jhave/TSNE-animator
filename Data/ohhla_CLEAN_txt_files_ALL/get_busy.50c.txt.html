[Verse One: 50 Cent]
I'm insane, yeah, shit changed
I'm ahead of that BANG! BANG! Guerilla ryder gang!
Make it rain, trick, make it rain
I hold onto mind and buy more cocaine
I'm! Off the chain, nigga I ain't playin
I get in with the semi nigga stunt I make it rain
He rap, I rap but we ain't the same
He love her dame, I run a train
Canary yellow rocks in my rings
Everything private my hoes in my planes
Hurry now bartender more champagne 
I shine like chrome interiors on a Range
I stunt when I want I ain't never 'gon change
That gold lookin good in my Cartier frames
This what happen when the Bebe kids
Blow up I'm on out this bitch  

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Sample from "Pee Wee Dance" by Joe Ski Luv)
I ball out bottle after bottle 'til I fall out
I stunt I do it my way
I'm on now get my money long now 
Look a here nigga you ain't gotta like me
You don't like me (Get Busy Get Busy Get!) Do sum'n! 
You don't like me (Get Busy Get Busy Get!) Do sum'n! 
You don't like me

[Verse Two: Kidd Kidd]
Tell me why you don't like me my chain too icey
The diamonds on my bright lens strikin like lighnin
Throwin cake on your wifey she lickin the icin
And a, it's not even my birthday
She tellin me she love me I don't wanna be her hubby
And plus yo' ass ain't 'posed to be here in the first place
Nowadays they holla Kidd let he hold sum'n
Look nigga 'cause I know ya I don't owe ya nothin
(HUH!) With ya broke ass, hoe ass
Type a nigga go and get wild with no mask 
Ryder gang thang play the bitch then watch us ball
It's my night more better luck tomorrow (OWWWWW!!!)
I'm a boss plus barkin big ballin
Shit talkin Benz parkin wrist glossin Kidd flossin
Tell the waitress bring the bottles with the top sparklin
Say money talk, nigga my shit hawkin
I'M OUT!!!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Sample from "Pee Wee Dance" by Joe Ski Luv)
I ball out bottle after bottle 'til I fall out
I stunt I do it my way
I'm on now get my money long now 
Look a here nigga you ain't gotta like me
You don't like me (Get Busy Get Busy Get!) Do sum'n! 
You don't like me (Get Busy Get Busy Get!) Do sum'n! 
You don't like me</pre>
