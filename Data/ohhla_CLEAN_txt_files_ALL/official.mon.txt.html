[Pharoahe Monch]
Pharoahe's Official like Starter, hit harder than Fort Greene
Authentic, Nike, Adidas and Spalding
Permitted behind the back like makin em all fiend
From my intricate ways to shake ya whole team
Official, Starter hit harder than Fort Green
No authentic, Nike, Adidas and Spalding
Permitted behind the back like makin em all fiend
For my intricate ways to break ya whole team

My style, make the whole crowd Se-au
Like number 55 on the Chargers
I promise thee I Dodge a nigga like Raul Mondesi
Somberly stay calm, fighting Means like Natrone
The bomb, like Hail Mary's inflated wit napalm
RAP PLEASE US! Deliver scriptures similar to Jesus
That you couldn't catch if you was Ivan Rodriguez
So don't compete within the zone where the ? is
I'm on the phone in the luxury box like George Steinbrenner
The owner, makin you give your Diamond-back like Arizona
Winnin always Indian like Chief Nakahoma
Sock a nigga in his face, Pharoahe's the Sporting Authority
Blacks attracted to my rap like dames to sororities
You already fucked up when you stepped up to bat
Strike (one) strike (two) strike (three), that's that

[Chorus]
Pharoahe's Official like Starter, hit harder than Fort Greene
Authentic, Nike, Adidas and Spalding
Permitted behind the back like makin em all fiend
For my intricate ways to break ya whole team
Official like Starter, hit harder than Fort Greene
No authentic, Nike, Adidas and Spalding
Permitted behind the back like makin em all fiend
For my intricate ways to shake ya whole team

Yo the realness stuck, females Blauch my Knob like Chuck
Dispense to standing in count commence to rebound like Buck Williams
Triple Crown threat to score, plus the bonus strange
Without the Rover, more range than Rey Ordonez
One of the MC's flip my kind of grammar on the break
Three on one like Phi Slamma Jamma
Serve a slot, a curve-splitter-knuckleball-spitter-change
Every rhyme hid a bitter note, quote "Get a game"
Not Allen Iverson, forget crossin-over shake men
Similar to Troy, I bring the pain destined to Aik-man
Break men off, take men out, make me wanna slander
Prime Time, my rhyme defense beyond Deion Sanders
I walk the earth with my Rod in this Strick-land
Promise, people thought I was Thomas Hearns the way I Hit Man

[Chorus]

(Official)
Yeah yeah, come on come on
It's Lee Stone, Pharoahe Monch for real
Wit the Official hip hop to kill
Know what's the deal, come on check it
Yo yo yo
Pharoahe's Official like Starter, hit harder than Fort Greene
Authentic, Nike, Adidas and Spalding
Then hid it behind the back like makin em all fiend 
For my intricate way ta-ta-ta-ta yo yo 
Official like Starter, hit harder than Fort Greene
Authentic, Nike, Adidas and Spalding
The minute behind the back like makin em all fiend
For my intircate way ta-ta-ta-ta
Yo, I stick around like hockey, now what the puck
Cooler than fuck, maneuver like Vancouver Canucks
In ya speaker, destroy your woofer, mids and tweeters
Not Wolverine but still I hold Claws like Shameeka
Water Boys get slaughtered automatic like Bobby Boucher
Push ya wig back like Marv Albert's toupe
Blaze a Trail like Portland on a track that'll amaze ya
Omnipotent on the D like Clyde Frazier
Slide, phase ya, glide get off the uhh
I'm comin wit the *scatting*</pre>
