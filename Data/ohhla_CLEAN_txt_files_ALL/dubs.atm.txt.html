[Chorus: Beyond] + (Slug)
Beyond and Slug got the shit you love
So go to your tape store and pick up the dub
It's the barge baby (you can touch it if you want)
It's the barge baby (yo, yo, you can touch it if you want)

[Beyond] + (Slug)
Yo, check it out
After I lacerate, what you think you coming back to take?
You aggravate tryna bite me, but I don't feel it
My philosophy is to keep all the lock and keys
Everything I got, conceal it, so they don't steal it
I'm stuck in poverty, but I keeps my head banging
So my kind of life keeps me aware of the trifling
(Bitch, you bitch) Is that the only thing you pay attention to?
And if it wasn't then I probably wouldn't mention you
It's like that, listen (money) now to flock in
But I told you (use your brains) my SoundScan's dropping
There's only two options, huh, die while grovelling
or be a man and stand to these bitches and coward men
Now and then it's gonna happen, you can believe me
So retreat before the barge comes to street sweep
Slug and Beyond, thus dawn of the end
Snatch your family, your friends before the monster's descend
We've been planning to take the world for a long time now
(It's time now) so all opposition lie down
I'm dying to plague the world and every city and angel
Let's come in this pretty girl's face, and then jet

[Slug] + (Beyond)
First to beat the uncertainty
Working the verses free for the purpose provided by props
Personally, I never gave a fuck
for the mucky murky mass that you're walking through (to get some pudding)
Been standing here for eternity, for a damn long time, forever
Somehow my patience grew muscular
Must be a side effect to the mental exorcism
Maintain, warm up this torn up brain
Strain, struggle, painkilling guzzle
End in poison, just to push the progress of the puzzle
And I'm looking for a quarter-piece, got the corner pieces perfect
Forcing me to see there's more than meets the surface
Mercy me, check the level of the mercury
Must begot the fever man, my helmet really hurting me
Circuitry twisted by a bitch named greed
Now all proceeds is going to smoking more weed
Please, you need to force-feed your head
and set your sights straight ahead and hit warp speed instead
of the foreseeable hate that you've got aimed at my crew
Pull your noble gown and get your shit together

[Chorus: Beyond] + (Slug)
Beyond and Slug's got the shit you love
So go to your tape store and pick up a dub
It's the barge baby (you can touch it if you want to)
It's the barge baby (you can touch it if you want to)
Yo, Beyond and Slug's got the shit you love
So go to your tape store and pick up a dub
It's the barge baby (you can touch it if you want to)
It's the barge baby (yo, you can touch it if you want to)

[Beyond] + (Slug)
What you thinking? Wait a minute y'all, don't answer me
Cause by chance you'll be, the same as the other ones
I'd love come out and play with you, waste a day with you
But something's fucking up my life, I gotta say it's you
In a day or two, hopefully I'll be away from you
You're too dumb to see the roadway that I've been taking you
Blow away the ashes, throw away the trash kid
Everlasting to be the ones forever blasting
(Yo, yo, we crashing that party on the north side)
(Tryna have that shit the dame day as ours?) Look at how they played their cards
Quarterly, all you little bitches better report to me
This is our city, I ain't playing or you'll see

(Take off your bra) Or you'll see
(Okay now bend over) Or you'll see

[Chorus: Beyond] + (Slug)
Beyond and Slug got the shit you love
So go to your tape store and pick up a dub
It's the barge baby (you can touch it if you want to)
It's the barge baby (yo, you can touch it if you want to)
Beyond and Slug's got the shit you love
So go to your tape store and pick up a dub
It's the barge baby (you can touch it if you want to)
It's the barge baby (yo, you can touch it if you want to)
Beyond and Slug's got the shit you love
So go to your tape store and pick up a dub
It's the barge baby (yo, you can touch it if you want to)

They be asking (yo, you can touch it if you want to)
They be asking (you can touch it if you want to)
They be asking (you can touch it if you want to)
(Yo, you can touch it if you want to)
(Yo, you can put your hand down my pants)
(Rhymesayers, big dicks, big dicks)
(We got room for all y'all to fit)</pre>
