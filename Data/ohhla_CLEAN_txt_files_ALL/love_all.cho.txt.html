[Choclair talking]
Unnh!
Ha ha, it's gotta be one of 'em Baby Blue joints
Turn it up a notch and let me see them speakers rock
Choclair featuring Mr. Mims
Aiyyo, Mims, who's this joint going out to?

[Chorus: Choclair]
This is for my street misses
The ones who like to creep misses
In the back seat of my Jeep misses
This is for the haters, yo!
The ones who floss with no doe
We love 'em all
You know that we love 'em all

Now people say you want to go and bring it to the streets but they realize its too far
So I want to bring it where they are 
Where they are, is usually at home doing dishes with they mom
Go back playing ball with Paul
I don't hate, when its love and I'm only gon roll with real thugs 
And show love to niggas who came from nothing and rose above 
And broke they balls to be a star
Now they shine bright, now this hood got a brighter light
See how its funny for me, how people wanna go and bad-talk me
But in a few years they be putting chips in your skinny, get your I.D.
Yet you suckas wanna hate on me, get your priorities right
I don't fight, sit back with a Conyac spark at the heavel bright 
And give you more of the Suave Dawg thing you been looking for
Then screw my foot under the Impalla floor
Feel great dogg, shots give the funk that stank
That pumps the radio, that pumps the G's in my bank
Take your whole boat off the plank
Rookie niggas try to step up with shots, he pulls rank
Chop your Accord, take your award
Your uniform's plain, your stripe's been torn
Reppin for the T-O-R-O-N-T-O T dot O dot

[Chorus: Choclair]
This is for my street misses
The ones who like to creep misses
In the back seat of my Jeep misses
This is for the haters, yo!
The ones who floss with no doe
We love 'em all
You know that we love 'em all

[Mr. Mims]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, I'm just tryin to live
Only take what you tryin to give
I don't wait, just take you for a ride in the 6
I don't wait, you ain't the only one I'm tryin to hit
Plenty other chicks signin the whip
I don't take long, I just scoop 'em up
Especially when the roof is up
You can hop in the Coup or Truck, it's all the same
Just don't play no games, like "Sean, I really don't think this much"
I'm not a family man, I'm in your dreams like Candy Man
Plus I only touch girls in Candy Land
When I'm in Panty Land, sweet enough to eat it up like Candy Yams
So call me Handy Man, I never, take chickens to the Sandy land
Never hawk chicks that could land a man
I take a girl out on a family plan
That's why these girls can stand me man!

[Chorus 2x: Choclair]
This is for my street misses
The ones who like to creep misses
In the back seat of my Jeep misses
This is for the haters, yo!
The ones who floss with no doe
We love 'em all
You know that we love 'em all

[Mr. Mims]
This is for my ballers, my hustlers, my, my, my, brothers
Who like, like my sisters who love it but need the covers
For my thugs, my soldiers tryin to get them Rovers
Who won't stop for nothing you want it sweeter

[Choclair]
The type of man I am I just don't groove 
Whether you come through with a crew makin noise so they boost ya
Cause niggas just cruise for lose cause they think what they drop 
is a shot like a shoota
But I ain't what ya used ta, I'm a familiar lookin brusta
T dot, watch out the heat we bring, Suave Dawg betta spread ya wings and fly

[Hook 2x: Choclair]
This is for my street misses
The ones who like to creep misses
In the back seat of my Jeep misses
This is for the haters, yo!
The ones who floss with no doe
We love 'em all
You know that we love 'em all</pre>
