[Verse]
My man Dirty had to boot it
Just to put me in my right mind
I rhyme stoned, drop jewels and bright lines
Siked dimes a slice, closed eyes
I'm sliced so by, why you ain't to go
That given thrown so by
Laugh it out by the pole light
Show Shorty to the back room
Place your race she acting like a vacuum
Showed her to the door before the afternoon
She fell hard on the floor
So you know that she'll be back soon
Fake MC get their raps wrong
Young villans up upon a track
And the track doom, click clack boom
Ressurect and boom back from the tomb
Drags dope like crack in cocoons
Back in this move, back on the move
It's the motherfucking real, nigga, chill, act cool
Pay respect to the cat drew
And I'm way too blessed
To be dough with shots, that's true

[Interlude]
Big ups, Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups, Brooklyn, home of the realer

I'm trying to find my own lane
In this freeway life
Just remember homeboy
It ain't no free way to life
My nigga has gone haas
Tryin' not to lose his soul
'Til the rims holes are gone
'Cause once the devil drive on
That nigga ain't letting go
And I'm far from religious
I just know right and wrong
I know how to write these songs
I know how to light these bongs
I know how to rip thongs
And I'm pretty good and being bald
Nigga, I'm so crazy, Nigga I'm loco gased up
Like Scirocco pressed the pedal to the floor
But you out the door
Bitch loved it in here, no more
'Cause I weave low, faking in a Louie bag
Weap chick I tried to back, 'cause she had the nerve
To turn me down, heard the song and turned around
Now she want me to enter her pants
But I'm gone bitch, missed your chance

Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realer
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realer

[Verse]
I got sick in class started making classics
Now all I really do is get the grass lit and, bus asses
I'm sure they'll blow like bust acid
Puff acids, like Mav' chuchu Maverick
And I'm average above average on an average day
Doing bad shit but you still can't pass this
And his teacher still pass him
Though they adolescence, they be having rapping secession's over adding lessons
Like fuck trigonometry, I'm trying to multiply
Monopolies and tax the homies, then divide the cheese
Divide lexus to resize the lease
So my eyes could see through the ease
Shown you all how about decease
A part of see, after asses like apostrophes
You can't stand here unless you pay a posture fee
Part of the cheese, head at the spot and leave
Apologies for apology
