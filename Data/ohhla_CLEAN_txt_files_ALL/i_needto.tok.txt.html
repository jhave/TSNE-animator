Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
I miss you just like a rainy summer
And I don't think I can bear this trauma
Much Longer
Asking myself these questions
Over and over
I need to know

[Chorus]
How do you feel
Are you happy
Do I ever cross your mind
Are you lonely
Are you good
Or is someone loving you
Do you cry when you're alone
If you're wondering why
It's just I need to know
Are you missing me the way I miss you

[Verse 1]
Sitting at the corner of my bed
Wondering why I can't get you
Outta my head
Do you feel the same
Are you still happy with my name
Or have you moved on instead
Tell me if you really meant every word you said
And why did you leave
Baby why did you leave

[Chorus]
How do you feel
Are you happy
Do I ever cross your mind
Are you lonely
Are you good
Or is someone loving you
Do you cry when you're alone
If you're wondering why
It's just I need to know (I need to know)
Are you missing me the way I miss you

[Verse 2]
Do you miss my loving when the nights get cold
Or do you have somebody else to hold
Do you ever think we would have made it
If we really tried
Dash away yuh pride
Do belong here by my side
Do you miss my loving baby
Do you miss my kisses
Do you even know what you misses
Baby I'm yuh mister your my misses
So put me where me missing
If reality a fixes then we are foreva

[Chorus]
How do you feel
Are you happy
Do I ever cross your mind
Are you lonely
Are you good
Or is someone loving you
Do you cry when you're alone
If you're wondering why
It's just I need to know
Are you missing me the way I miss you

[Bridge]
I miss you just like a rainy summer
And I don't think I can bear this trauma
Much Longer
Asking myself these questions
Over and over
I need to know

[Chorus]
How do you feel
Are you happy
Do I ever cross your mind
Are you lonely
Are you good
Or is someone loving you
Do you cry when you're alone
If you're wondering why
It's just I need to know
Are you missing me the way I miss you</pre>
