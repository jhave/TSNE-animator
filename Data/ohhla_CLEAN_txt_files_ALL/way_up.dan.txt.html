Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Danny Brown]
Bitch, I'm way up here
Can't hear what you're saying
Gone with all that hating
So it's fuck you pay me [x2]

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Bitch, I'm way up here
You a tattoo to a statue
Run a mic like Michelangelo draw, too
While I turn this bitch into Saw II
Bitch, I'm way up here
And you down there on that totem pole
I'm on the road and I'll fuck your girl
And I'll put this dick up in a whirl
Bitch, I'm way up here
And you down there like a little nigga
I'll buy you up on that rent card
You still around here? You better thank God
Bitch, I'm way up here
I ain't worry about what's down there
I'll take a step, look on my shoe and you'll be splattered everywhere
Bitch, I'm way up here
Can't hear what none of y'all talking about
I'm on top of a mountain and you just started climbing rocks

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Bitch, Iâm way up here
Donât care what down there doing
âcause up here, up here, down there, down there
And you donât moving how Iâm movinâ

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Bitch, I'm way up here
Come on girls, you down?
You with it? I'm with it
Go on ahead, go down, uh
Bitch, I'm way up here
Puffing pot on a mountain top
Dipping in that bag
White girl on my countertop (Soulo)
Bitch, I'm way up here
Drop it like it's hot, ho
I ain't move no birds, but
She in love with my cock, though
Bitch, I'm way up here
Looking down on you little niggas
Got a 16 with a seal on it
Shot glass with a pill in it (Soulo)
Bitch, I'm way up here
Y'all all under my telescope
So much that I'm squintin'
You ain't snitchin', but you can tell 'em though
Bitch, I'm way up here
Hah, can't hear what you saying
Smoking on that strong, strong, like a super saiyan, saiyan
Bitch, I'm way up here
HiiiPower, Top Dawgs, all dogs, go to heaven, not y'all</pre>
