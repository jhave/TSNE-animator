Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Just one emcee and one DJ
We gonna break it on down in the old school way
So just rock with it just rock with it
So just rock with it the most defenedly
Cmon and rock with it

Once upon a time 2000 years ago
Well there once a guy that some yall know
He would rock the mic everywhere he'd go
They came from far and wide just to hear him flow
With the crowd packed tight every single show
And they just got hype whenever he came on
They would put they hands high and just sing along
Every word every line every single song
And everywhere he'd go and everywhere he'd be
They wanted to see how he rocked on the M-I-C
And everytime when he came to rock the party
He would roll with twelve guys in his posse
He was the true old schooler microphone ruler
Fresh with the lyrics bringing it right to ya
So if ya ain't heard we came just to school ya

Just one emcee and one DJ
We gonna break it on down in the old school way
So just rock with it just rock with it
So just rock with it the most defenedly
Cmon and rock with it

Ow the sucka emcees put him to the test
Used to call him names and said you ain't fresh
And they tried to throw down and they tried to mess
And plus they even tried to put him to death
See they tried and they tried just to stop this cat
He was crucified and died but it's a fact
That he was gonna rise but he came back
And that's word to the wise
Cause it be like that
And then he rose to the sky said he'll be right back
So ya better check the rhyme and be on track
If you're short or tall or skinny or fat
Or red or yellow or white or black
If you the dont on the mic or you're just plain wack
Without Christ in your life man you ain't got that
And that's the reason we had to bust this rap
One emcee on the mic and the DJ on the scratch

Just one emcee and one DJ
We gonna break it on down in the old school way
So just rock with it just rock with it
So just rock with it the most defenedly
Cmon and rock with it

Now I just told you what you must do
And I tried to showed you the only way that's true
But in the end my friend now it's up to you
See there's two choices left just for you to choose
So you need to get down with the freshest crew
Cuz they been running it now since the old school
So peace I'm out is what I say to you
And I pass it down to my man just do what you do

Just one emcee and one DJ
We gonna break it on down in the old school way
So just rock with it just rock with it
Cmon and rock with it
So just rock with it the most defenedly
Cmon and rock with it</pre>
