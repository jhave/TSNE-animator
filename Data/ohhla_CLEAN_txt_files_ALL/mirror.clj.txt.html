Uhh
Yeah, yeah {*whispered: "Oh my God"*}
Uhh (he's back) success (he's back)
{*whispered: "They love success!"*} (Where you been?)
Right here baby

[LL Cool J]
Look in the mirror while I tell you a tale
About a mogul named Uncle L
Sit on eight figures, man with a vision, move with precision
(He excels, they all fail)
Undisputed, the game got so polluted
that he turned his +Radio+ off
He +Needed a Beat+ so he could +Jingle+ them bells again
Watchin the plasma TV in the loft (with somethin soft)
with a leapord print outfit on
Cause he known to flood any mic he spit on
He's a (uhh uhh, +Phenomenon+)
Ice glistenin, listenin to +Break of Dawn+
He went from.. +Hollis to Hollywood+ in fact
Owned the Dow Jones and stacked the NASDAQ
Conference call with his broker, 'What's the yield on that?'
"Exotic Motorcars," we want a deal on that

[Chorus: sung] + (LL)
Mirror mirror (you go baby) speak to me (you flow baby)
What's this image that I see before me (you know baby)
It's a winner (you go baby) please believe it (you go baby)
I can see it so I can achieve it (you flow baby, you go baby)

[LL Cool J]
+Around the Way Girls+ be +Doin' It+ well
They love the way that man look on the (XXL)
On the Money magazine covers
When he stop at the light, it's like his Benz hovers
Smoke blowin from the chrome exhaust, of his Boxer Porsche
(Look at him, lickin his lips when his joint pull off)
Ever since +Boomin' System+, damn she missed him
She, couldn't resist him, dreamt she kissed him
In a, warm jacuzzi full of +Milky Cereal+
She said (I need love from the grand imperial)
I been his biggest fan since five years old
And now I'm 22, I love money (oooh)
+Backseat of the Jeep+, you need that
(Who do you love?) Baby repeat that
(Who do you love?) You need to keep back
Milk and +Pink Cookies+ he known to eat that

[Chorus]

[LL Cool J]
Tryin to get as much money as possible, no negative consequences
Knahmsayin baby?  I'm goin long, feel me..

+Hey Lover+, I'm +Loungin'+
+Goin' Back to Cali+, cop a crib on the mountain
Strobelights jumpin off, birdies is bouncin
+(4)-to-the-3-2-1+, he stopped countin
Eliminated competition quickly
Phantom of the Opera on the low where your clique be
He feel his flow deep down in your artery
Peep her man's checkbook (uh) that's where his heart'll be
+6 Minutes of Pleasure+ for +Jack the Ripper+
Young players fall quicker from chicks and hard liquor (ahahah)
But uhh, he's +Bad+, he got +The Power of God+
In the Four Seasons, laughin at the L'urmitage(?)
He been there, mini-bars, R&amp;B stars
Young groupies in the lobby on the search for (Bobby)
Young tycoon in the Steve Wynn suite
Readin e-mails with ten on repeat, I seen it

[Chorus] + (LL speaking over, can't be heard clearly)

[LL Cool J]
Yeah, 10, faith, power of God
Yeah, c'mon, work it with me baby
Work with me ma, uhh, it's been too long, 10</pre>
