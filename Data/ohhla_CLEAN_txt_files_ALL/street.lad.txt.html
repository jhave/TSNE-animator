*Chorus* Tekitha

Street life, is the only life I know
Street life, where we got no place to go
Street life, where the struggle won't let you be
Street life, where the drugs and thugs meet

Verse 1:

Yo, I bust shots out glocks wid kids that push rocks
Hol' glocks run in spots wid G's like Fort Knox
Rhyme excellent kill 'em wid intelligence
Get money like embezzlement, worrying as the president
LA the Dark coming, inheriting nature, Islamic
Stay loyal to my clan like Elijah Mohammed
That's a promise, creating them secrets be like amazing
Everytime I touch the track I swing my axe and stake it
Speed racing through life world class 
LA let the tech splash 
My lyrics hard as brass
Show 'em all-star, check me in the Source y'all
'98 Ford car purchased near Fort Bar
Damn I'm aways sharp man, accurate, sharp-shooter, marksman
Running through New York air painted like Al Sharpton
And sing, my guns be black and shallow ringed
Computerised thugs dropping checks in the bank
And then....

Chorus

Verse 2:

Yo, yo, yo
You on my dick
My life is like a James Bond flick
Mad bitches, mad bullets but I never get hit
Yo, from herpes to trees, Tv's and MTv's
Niggas in jail for life the strongest hurt to leave
&gt;From bloods at night in Kings, to bounce back to Queens
Drugs and dope fiends scream over the limosine
Pop the 2 fort kings sucking dick on porno screens
Vaginas some clean wid terrible hygiene
To survive on my block G is devils at halloween
The young son got guns wid 50 shot magasine
And digital web beams
Getting drunk off gasoline
Robbing niggas marked, die for this cane in this dream
In this.....

Chorus 

Verse 3:

Yo,yo,yo
I'm unstoppable 
Rainbow garment stay tropical
Jewels stay rockable
Crystal clear optical
My niggas got bodies 
Get watched like John Gotti in a mansion 
Wid a monk learning Wu-Tang karate
It's unfortunate niggas can't afford this
My 20 blew chords here
I hate eating sword fish 
Surrounded by 20 men cold-blooded at the amphibian
In the Benz puffing tree shit from the Caribbean
And sparking it....
