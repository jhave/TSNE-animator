[Intro/Chorus: Anthony Evans]
If this life has anything to gain at all
I'll count it loss if I can't hear you, feel you
Cause I need you, can't walk this earth alone
I recognize I'm not my own, so before I fall
I need to hear you, feel you
As I live to make my boast in you alone

[Lecrae]
With every breath I take, with every heart beat
Sunrise and the moon lights in the dark street
Every glance, every dance, every note of a song
It's all a gift undeserved that I shouldn't have known
Every day that I lie, every moment I covet
I'm deserving to die, I'm just earning your judgment
I, without the cross there's only condemnation
If Jesus wasn't executed there's no celebration
So in times that are good, in times that are bad
For any times that I've had it all I will be glad
And I will boast in the cross, I'll boast in my pains
I will boast in the sunshine, boast in his reign
What's my life if it's not praising you?
Another dollar in my bank account of vain pursuit
I do not count my life as any value or precious at all
Let me finish my race, let me answer my call

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
Tomorrow's never promised, but it is we swear
Think we holding our own, just a fist full of air
God has never been obligated to give us life
If we fought for our rights, we'd be in hell tonight
Mere sinners owed nothing but a fierce hand
We never loved him, we pushed away his pierced hands
I rejected his love, grace, kindness, and mercy
Dying of thirst, yet, willing to die thirsty
Eternally worthy, how could I live for less?
Patiently you turned my heart away from selfishness
I volunteer for your sanctifying surgery
I know the Spirit's purging me of everything that's hurting me
Remove the veil from my darkened eyes
So now every morning I open your word and see the son rise
I hope in nothin, boast in nothin, only in your suffering
I live to show your glory, dying to tell your story

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
Glory was solely meant for you
Doing what no one else could do
With all I have to give (with all I have to give)
I'll use my life, I'll use my lips (my lips yeah)
I'll only glory in your word
What gift to me I don't deserve
I'll live in such a way that it reflects to you, my praise

[Chorus]</pre>
