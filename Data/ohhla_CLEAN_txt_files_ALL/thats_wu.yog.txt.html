[Intro]
It been a long time comin' (Yeh!) and a lot of dope run-in' (C'monn!)
Hustlin' trynna dodge these cases (This ya boi, Yo Gott-Ayye!)
You niggas been tellin' and tha streets been beggin' (Yeh!)
So I had to go +Back 2 Da Basics+ (INE!)

[Verse 1]
This tha intro to my life, in-trip to my world
Ridgecrest Apartments, movin' dat white gurl
Posted up on tha corna, movin' dat marijuana
Glock .40 on my hip, holl'in out "Chu ain't wann' it!"
My glock stay cocked, rocks in a match box
Head guarlin' on lock - I'ma go getta!
A nigga raided ya spot, conviscated cha block
And he didn't git shot - you'se a ho' nigga!
And I rememba you, do you rememba me?
8th grade leavin' school, rockin' up a quarter ki (Dat's wussup!)
D-tops on dat 'Z', I was passin' ya
Fish tail swervin' witcha bitch on tha passenger, side
Shawty, let's ride (Whuddup!), rims still spinnin' so shawty let's glide (Whuddup!)
She askin' me why, I don't git, high
'Cause bitch, I make 50 off a 3,5
And dat's wussup!

[Chorus]
See me nigga, say "Wussup!"
Wanna be me nigga - dat's wussup (Yeh!)
'Bout ya dolla, pop ya colla then you holla - dat's wussup (Yo Gott-Ayye!!)
See me shawty, say "Wussup!"
Wanna fuck me shawty, dat's wussup (Yeh!)
Dat's wussup, dat's wussup, d-dat's wussup, dat's wussup (INE!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

Quarter million out tha pocket sayd promotion, fuck it
Whuddup Trap-niggas, scrapin' up dat durrti change (Whuddup!)

Regroup ya advance, take royalties and publish it
Putchu on TV and leave ya out there wit nuthin'
