Typed by: AZ Lyrics

In a room filled with holographic images
Path is limitless, death that's ridiculous
I'm a live forever cause a legend never die
See the world is simple, but complex in the design
I spent some time just thinkin'
Where did that get me?
High, more drinkin'
Now my head empty
So can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checking bitches off my hit list
Try and understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient, halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out the perfect world the lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal is a loaded gun
And I'm a shoot somebody in the face if they're too slow to run
Mac Miller I'm the only one
But I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium

Got my middle finger up with a cup
And a dutch split, hands on my nuts
While I'm wildin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America [x2]

Still in a room filled with holographic images
Crushing information into powder then I'm sniffin' it
Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed
I learn that the future death of you adjusting to the fed
Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest
Hop into a jag, get some rest to the things of stress
G this is what I do the best
Nothing that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest
Save hard, a brave heart, a warrior
I take caution, stay far from coroners
I heard some corny words said about my music though
Talkin' all that shit sound exactly like a groupie hoe
Most dope, got you hooked, yellow roofie oh
First you lose you mind then you lose your soul
So what you talkin' about? Given you're out of options
American border, pipper but formal, above and beyond, Medal of Honor

Got my middle finger up with a cup
And a dutch split, hands on my nuts
While I'm wildin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America [x2]

Yo chick live in Pittsburgh? bet I steal her,
Said I'm on my way to Mac Miller
Comin' up in a world full of killers
I'll be shaded up at the villa,
With a girl that know that know what the deal is,
Yeah they know I came from the illest
City on a map, we don't know that
Release young rap, go getters of America
Bad chick get tossed around like the merry go
CV and Mac meezy takin' off them PJ's
We the future so every night is a new day
Sittin' in the studio, chain on my hat low
Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show
I can trigger the wave in my sleep
Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat
Wake up shower, get paid and repeat
Spit one flow and got made on the streets
Welcome to the land where you never stay for free
Swag worth a mill, drive cass but the deal badges

Got my middle finger up with a cup
And a dutch put his hands on my nuts
While I'm wildin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America [x2]

Now to drop hot shit, running out of patience nigga snot sick
Rolling up the dankest loud plane going mach 6
Rise to the top and top a change the glocks in the stock
Exchange that watch the price of the life on the block
Drop insane, you can't stop this rain
Dope name drop in vane
In hells sides a lake from tropic strange towards aqua strange
Last week you was nothing boxers stain
Everybody love him and chicks offered top for fame
So the top I aim, testin' waters so up in the flow
No deal but flow so real keepin' in the scopes
Sun got shine, now he said he said but he never did but no
Still facing L's you would he the niggas wins was low
What you think I'm in this for? Won't stop till the nigga who invented dope
In the flow we'll be off by dropping prison soap
Begging for forgiveness but the spinnin's though
I'm record spittin' in these flows
Got it up as this snotty up in the stow</pre>
