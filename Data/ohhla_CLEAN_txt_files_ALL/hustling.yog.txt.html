Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I been hustlin' all my life
All I know is sell white, (live from the kitchen)
Know is sell white, All I know is sell white. (Yo Gotti!)
Young Blood on the green but I'd rather sell white, (that residue)
Rather sell white, (that extra shit) I'd just rather sell white nigga. (that extra rich)
But I ratha sell white, ratha sell white, ratha sell white (I'm a dopeboy for life nigga!)
Young Blood on the green but I'd rather sell white
Man I'll never change my life cuase I ratha sell white!

I know I'm gettin checks, but I rather see it cash
Pussy ass niggas out here workin for the task
And I'm just int he kitchen, like I'm workin with my last
Sweatin bullets over the stove, I'm just tryin to bring it back!
Put my city on the TV, call it 48 hours
Them fuck niggas be snitchin but we murdered the cowards
And we just in the hood selling crack, weed, and powder
Every minute, every second, every motha fuckin hour!
Dis my life, dis my story, feel my motha fuckin pain
You can rap about that work, me an you are not the same
Put my life into a pot, little rotation from my wrist and you get dis
My residue, that extra shit
My mexican just brought me 30 bricks in the Hyundai!
Do I look like I got time to check on motha fuckin Myspace?
And I be Gucci down, head to toe on a Sunday!
Just like a fuckin model like I stepped off the runway
Put on for my city like I'm Jeezy or Kanye!
Hundred-round choppers so you better not come my way
Me tool feel like them niggas who owe me checks
Big pistol down to die about my respect. CHEA!
Ain't no pimp, got a hoe outside
You lookin at 5 50, look like snow outside
WHITE ER'THING! My favorite color!
Cocaina Paint, represent the struggle!
We mafia! Stay ont he grind. Selling white shit that hipnotize minds
Rich park, they ball hard
MJ's on my feet, comin out hard
Momma worried, just prayin to God
That youngest son that live behind bars (NA!)
Stop the beat, where da Menphis Dro?
Fire it up! Dis my Southern Smoke!</pre>
