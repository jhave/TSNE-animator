Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro: Tyga]
Feels good don't it?
Stress, have a lot of stress to get off my chest
{Aww baby let me talk to you baby}
Y'know I think if sometimes we would have talked it out
{Ayy, sit dowwwwwwwwwn}
And said I'm sorry... but it never happened that way
So I went to bed with my music {now listen}

[Chorus]
Why do we fight, why do argue you
all through night, when we should be pillow talkin baby?
Make the wrongs, all things aside
Swallow our pride, and just love each other all the time
You got me, and I got you
What else could really matter but loooooooooovin
That's what it's all about
'til death does us part

[Tyga]
Dear Princess, remember, what I called you
Markin those calendar days away til that moment I saw you
And I fell, in love, from that very moment I saw you
Glad I, played on the phone and dialed them numbers to call you
Now I'm, thinkin about how could that go wrong?
You was so special to me like the music in this song
From my heart, I said 'til death, do us apart
But then, dated for only a month or so, how is this possible?
She she got me stutterin, my words beginnin to slur
As I say, I love her, but I'm lovin it, it feels so right
When I'm, huggin her, she sayin the same she feelin complete like
two way streets, ringin my phone, she never hear a beep
That means, I'm answerin, fulfilling her every need and desire
Your dream, this is life with me, continuous shoppin sprees
When I'm on the road, even gave you all the security codes
So baby, tell me, tell me

[Chorus]

[Tyga]
I thought it was more to what we had, her secret stash
Filled with bundles of emotions now I'm startin to notice
All that shit was bogus, all the dozens of roses
Thinkin, you was my golden token, now I'm feelin frozen
Lookin like my life is hopeless, no human
should ever experience what I drove in, now my car is broken
My engine hood I should have never left it opened
Lookin like I'm on E, no fuel I can't even eat
Don't even want to breathe if you ain't close to me; no friends
My only enemy is Cupid, how could you be so stupid?
Please tell me why love hurts, can you even hear me?
Can you even imagine if your arrow wasn't workin for weeks
I don't, think so, I'm just tryin, to think slow
It just ain't me, so please, play the drum rolls
And roll the red carpets out, as I wait for you to return
with an explanation, so baby start explainin

[Chorus]

[Outro: Tyga]
Heh~! I hope you heard the whole song
It was from me to you, somethin special
Heh~! I'm lovin this music
But I wish you was here with me
to love it too... {*fades out*}</pre>
