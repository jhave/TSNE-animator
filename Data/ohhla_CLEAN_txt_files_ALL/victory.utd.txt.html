[ Mos Def ]
This is for all of you

This is for all of you

This is for all of you

For all of you

ALL of you

ALL

[ VERSE 1: Mos Def ]
Ever since I was small I played the wall
The loner type, even as a little tike
While the other little kids were out at play
I was home wishing for a rainy day
I didn't have friends cause I barely even spoke
My head was mad out on a ( ? ) float
Surrounded all sides by thieves and crooks
I found a little peace in stars and books
My outside contact was limited
Cause I was different and heads couldn't get with it
I used to get mistaken for the stove
But all I really ever wanted was some love
Remember many ( ? ) many tears
That I kept inside for so many years
All the galactic intuition
I learned the skill of bein self-sufficient
Heads got live while I took the jay
I watched the sky and let the daytime fade
Go through a whole 24 hours of sorrow
Lay down and do the shit all again tomorrow
Keepin composure is a way ( ? )
I'm smilin in your face, all my chest is hurtin
I wanna be nice but that shit ain't workin
Turn off the light and draw the curtain
Will I find peace, son, I'm not certain
In dark, quiet places feelings go
Beatin you down all hard and slow
Oh-oh-oh-oh... oh

I'm tired of these devils
[ DCQ ]
Victory is not granted to the swift and mighty, you know what I'm sayin
[ Ces ]
That's what the devil wants
It wants you to be afraid
[ DCQ ]
You can get hot, but can you sustain the heat?
[ Ces ]
That's how you lose your power
[ Mos Def ]
Where is the power available to you?
[ DCQ ]
Things that rise too quickly, fall even faster
[ Ces ]
Maintain, maintain, maintain
[ DCQ ]
Things that rise too quickly fall even faster
[ Ces ]
Maintain, maintain, maintain
Maintain, maintain, maintain

[ VERSE 2: Ces ]
The night brings courage and solutions
Images and dramatic conclusions
I play back a hundred thousand scenes
Cut the proper sneer and practice bein mean
I've taken too many a loss
Man, fuck patience, it's time to excercise force
It's the last thing heads would expect
If they won't give it to me, I'm takin my respect
And I'm usin all means at hand
Cause apparently muthafuckas don't understand
They don't know the fury behind the meekness
Mistakin my kindness for weakness
Well peep this: It's a bright new day
And we gon' do it this way
Call me MD with revenge prognosis
I'm handin out justice in powerful doses
Comin out the deck with aces and jokers
Flushing whoever comes closest
Strictly hands over ears when you try to make amends
I got my pad and pen, so who the hell needs friends?
You think I'm on some shit? You're goddamn right
My area of peace is like mad airtight
Attempt to trespass my radius, and we gon' have to fight
My heart is too heavy for you to take me light
I exit sufferer status (aight?)
So if you thought otherwise, I'ma let you know
That when the tables turn, they movin hard and slow

Maintain

Maintain, maintain, maintain
When they resist, I persist
