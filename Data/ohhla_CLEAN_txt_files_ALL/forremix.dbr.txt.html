[Jermaine Dupri]
If anybody gonna shake the club, y'all know who, ya know
Do they know, ha ha, So So Def
Yeah, we couldn't let it go without doin' a remix
Shh, now club to club
I want y'all to bounce with me, with me, with me, with me
Bounce, Brat, Missy, J.D., come on

[Missy]
Yo, come here baby, let me kiss ya
Let me see what cha' bout when I'm witcha
Let me see what cha' talkin' bout big shot
If you got that dough, can I get some
Let me see that Benz, can I drive, dude
Can I have when I ride right beside you
Oh, side by side, I got my crew
Oh, you act a little funny nigga, fuck you
Cause I'm that bitch with the six shots
Six blocks, big knots, big tick-tocks
Drop tops and shit just won't stop
Y'all flop when Miss drop, I rock [* Dogs Barking *]
I'm gon' get y'all
Bang bang to the boogie, take a picture
Of a hot girl and big time
With a thong, it's on when I hit y'all
That's what I'm lookin' for

[Jermaine Dupri]
Uh, yo
I'm lookin' for a bitch that'll switch that thang
From right to left like no other
Type of girl that'll blow your (Brain)
Wanna rock your (Chain)
Make you wanna take to meet cha' mother
No matter what baby keeps it (Name brand)
Never let a nigga change her (Game plan)
Even though it might look like she switch up
Every night honey fucks with the (Same man)
Hit the mall, get fresh just (Like I do)
Wanna have wild sex just (Like I do)
Bottle to the neck just (Like I do)
That's what I'm lookin' for
She gotta be jazzy
But when she do her thang it's ghetto style
Tellin me, JD, nigga say my name
Like she a new member of Destiny's Child
I like those that got hair but still rock a weave
Know just what to do to make a nigga not leave (Oh)
Know just what to wear to make a nigga go dream
Know just what to say to get the bling
For others she won't but (Will for me)
Come in and pay some of these (Bills for me)
Not just standin' around lookin (Real pretty)
I'm talkin' bout a bitch that'll (Kill for me)

[Hook: J.D.]
Where my thong wearin' shorties at
Got the game down packed
Got they own car, little crib and a dough stack
[All: That's what I'm lookin' for]
They know just what a brotha needs
How to throw it and make him not wanna leave
When it's time to go down, they ain't scared to freak
[ALL: That's what I'm lookin' for]
And where my Proda wearin' shorties who
Claim they don't love you
But anytime you want something done, they do
[ALL: That's what I'm lookin' for]
Them 4, 5, 6 types
Down to do it all night
See that there, is the type of bitch I like
[ALL: That's what I'm lookin for]

[Da Brat]
Oh yeah
See me, I like a big, buff nigga, get tough nigga
Sex me rough till I beg to get up nigga
What's up?
You got a hot cars
I'ma need to ride find (What I'm lookin' for)
To bump these hot boys, let me get the Visa
So I can Discover your MasterCard
Let's cruise the beaches and then park the yacht
At the dock at the beaches
Don't stop, got nothin' but hot releases
A thug by my side cause I need em'
Forget any reason I give
He'll stop a nigga from breathin' cause he lives for me
Dedicated to Brat only
That sexy smile, personality, my (Complextion) give a nigga (Erection)
Condom in the bra for (My protection)
Tell ya at the end and begin it with Shawn
What's my name (Brat)
And I can fuck all night till the break of dawn
Lookin' for me, a thug that's ready to get it on
I'm like an athletic down to sweat
Cause he gotta get it
Cut, split it and wet it, servin' me cause he love to get it
And it tastes so good he'll never forget
Believe me when I spit
It's a party, move yo body, come on

[Missy]
1-      Move your body, move to the music (Yeah)
       Grab somebody, keep it movin'
       Get up on the dance floor, shake your thang now
       Everybody in the club
       [ALL: That's what I'm lookin for]

[Hook: Da Brat]
2-      Where my rollie wearin thugs who
       Claim they don't love you
       But anytime you want something done they do
       [ALL: That's what I'm lookin' for]
       The ball all night type, frontin', screamin' thug life
       That's the type of nigga I like
       [ALL: That's what I'm lookin' for]
