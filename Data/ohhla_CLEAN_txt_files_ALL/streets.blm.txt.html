[Buckshot]
On the block that I rest on, it's kind of hot
In the summertime, my niggas duck from shots
Even thou we wanna party man this shit go on
You can hear the most shots if you up at dawn
Five o'clock in the morning, nigga where you gonna be
Outside on the corner, mourning
More swarm in, like killer bees
On the target to kill up a lot of O.G.'s
Niggas see dying now-a-days come with ease
If you run into your enemies then freeze
Caught with your pants down, way down, you gotta lay down
Cuz if you don't, nigga could get buck by the spray down
Keep sayin that it can't happen
Now-a-days niggas stop flappin, and talk thru the black gat

"On the Streets"-Buckshot    "Where I be at"-Tek
"My niggas move with the heat"-Tek    "POW!!"
"Strollin thru my hood"-WC   "Ducking from bullets"-Pos of De La Soul

Niggas be bugging me out, swearing they the Dons of the street
Walking with they fake Cron's heat
Sometimes I think about the ones that bluff
And the ones that bluff, usually never get enough
It's a rough life, I gotta stay tight
Never let a nigga know where you rest at night
Too many plot like there your people from back
In the days, now you niggas don't know how to act
See me with a little stack and want to start assuming
That a nigga's cheddar is better and everything is moving
So yo, can I hit something, niggas retaliate
I tell them quick that I can't wait to jack something
Up in the grill, but not Jamaica
Niggas now-a-days try to blaze ya, to grave ya

"My niggas move with the heat"-Tek    "POW!!"
"Strollin' thru my hood"-WC   "Ducking from bullets"-Pos of De La Soul</pre>
