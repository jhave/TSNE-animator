Verse 1: Afrika

Now, I won't say that I'm a ladies lover
But if I was, you'd be under my cover
And not only that, you'd be under my wing
And me and you'd be doin' the nasty thing
Whenever you're ready, we can go steady
You can be my baby and I can be your teddy
It's cold out there, but it's warm in here
I know you have another lover, but I do not care

Verse 2: Mike G

Now, behind my bush, there's only room for two
Jimmy and Jane, that's me and you
Doin' it right 'til the morning light
A ittle moan and groan after some fuss and fight
Jungle love is all that I'm givin
Jungle life is all that I'm livin
Girl, I'm-a do ya the best I can
Lettin' you know I'm your jungle man
You can't front it off, you know it's gonna get ya
I'm doin' this (where?) live from Africa

Verse 3: Afrika

I want to be your hero
I want to be your man
I want to love you every moment I can
I want to take you back to the motherland
And listen to the sounds of a steel-drum band
Climb up a tree, just you and me
'Cause that's the way that I want it to be
Feel the breeze, put your mind at ease
See the pretty birds and the chimpanzees
After that, we'd step down to my hut
And together, we'd split up a coconut
Watch the sun set, watch the moon rise
And then I'd proceed to make your nature rise

Verse 4: Mike G

I'll be your caveman, I'll be a brave man
But most of all, I'll be a gentle man
Your magic man, alakazam
I put a spell on you that you can not stand
Sweat and want you, it will surely taunt you
To do what you want to do
And that shall take me behind the bush and do me, baby</pre>
