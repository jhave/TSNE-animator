Typed by: AZ Lyrics

How could you make right look wrong?
And wrong look right?
And right look wrong?
When your rights are gone
Your rights are gone
Your rights are gone
Your rights are gonnnne
Your rights

What chu gonna do when your backs against the wall?
Are you gonna lay down on the ground? Or be a man and stand up tall?
Seeking for a reason Always searching for the truth
You gotta fight, fight, fight! Cause we are the angry youth

I'm broke with no money trying to make some ends
Thinking about the situation how I'm gonna win
Be at the top of my game and have a little bit of cash
Nice court, nice house, fine wife with an ass
Angry youth pissed off at the government
It feels like punishment,They run from it
Dipping tripping trying to stay high
Laughing, joking just to get by

(Youth) What chu think he youth is just gonna back off? (Angry Youth)
(Youth) With your blatant lies, and your crooked views. (Angry Youth)
(Youth) Hate to be the bearer of bad news (Angry Youth)
(Youth) Time change, game over that's it your through (Angry Youth)
(Youth) Moving in like a bulldozer I'm plowing (Angry Youth)
(Youth) It's what we want, not what you're allowing (Angry Youth)
(Youth) We're all grown up now, the rules have changed (Angry Youth)
(Youth) It's time to interupt this whole world game (Angry Youth)

What chu gonna do when your backs against the wall?
Are you gonna lay down on the ground? Or be a man and stand up tall?
Seeking for a reason Always searching for the truth
You gotta fight, fight, fight! Cause we are the angry youth
What chu gonna do when your backs against the wall?
Are you gonna lay down on the ground? Or be a man and stand up tall?
Seeking for a reason Always searching for the truth
You gotta fight, fight, fight! Cause we are the angry youth

In the world day to day, I'm tired
When I feel alive, I'm Livewire
Rub out the fire, of another soul I get higher
And if I had it all my way, today, I'd fuckin' retire
&gt;From the life they created, people chasing ends
Shitting on they friends for a Mercedes Benz
Old rims, New Tims, get caught, life ends, what then? What then!?

What then, what why, what where, what how?
Lets say and flip this whole scipt on ya Now
Would you still be chasing, paper chasing, making enemies?
Stop just once, think twice, don't front, ugh

I play to win, stay away from all the bustas
Live my life, people say that I'm a hustler
Just get high, relax what offer could be better, figure it out or you're gonna be screwed

What chu gonna do when your backs against the wall?
Are you gonna lay down on the ground? Or be a man and stand up tall?
Seeking for a reason Always searching for the truth
You gotta fight, fight, fight! Cause we are the angry youth
What chu gonna do when your backs against the wall?
Are you gonna lay down on the ground? Or be a man and stand up tall?
Seeking for a reason Always searching for the truth
You gotta fight, fight, fight! Cause we are the angry youth

(Youth) When punk rock came around (Angry Youth)
(Youth) Was born this rebel sound (Angry Youth)
(Youth) The fuck you attitude (Angry Youth)
(Youth) No lies we want the truth (Angry Youth)
(Youth) Then hip hop hit the stage (Angry Youth)
(Youth) Police spit on their badge (Angry Youth)
(Youth) Respond the bastard sound (Angry Youth)
(Youth) The Kottonmouth Kingdom (Angry Youth)

Smoked out loced out, Whats my name? (D-Loc!)
Representing? (Kottonmouth Kings!)
Stay down for my Krown (Yea, yeah!)
Now put your hands in the air (Yea!)
Right now, who's down to ride? (We ride, we ride!)
Who's down to blaze? (We blaze, we blaze!)
How much you smoke? (How much you got?)
An ounce a day! (Not a little bit a lot!)

What chu gonna do when your backs against the wall?
Are you gonna lay down on the ground? Or be a man and stand up tall?
Seeking for a reason Always searching for the truth
You gotta fight, fight, fight! Cause we are the angry youth
What chu gonna do when your backs against the wall?
Are you gonna lay down on the ground? Or be a man and stand up tall?
Seeking for a reason Always searching for the truth
You gotta fight, fight, fight! Cause we are the angry youth

Are you gonna lay down on the ground? Or be a man and stand up tall?
