Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Gettin higher than the soul of little Shaniya
To the ones that killed her, hope you burn in fire
I'm burnin tires on the strip, tryna get a grip
Liquor in the cupholder, tryna get a sip
6 shots of Hennessey, I'm still goin strong
Please numb me from the bullshit that's goin on
That girl was 5 years old that they just murdered
And did some wicked shit to her that was unheard of
You fuckin coward
Ain't gotta tell em' go to Hell
Cause that's the shit that make them other niggaz sick in Jail;
So you gon' feel it
Travel the world reppin this city, know I'm gon kill it
But yet a nigga ain't got a clue... how I'm gon deal with
All the bullshit. Niggaz sendin shots my way
You put a hit out on me, think that I'm gon stop? No way
Gon have to kill me, or witness a nigga livin so filthy
Young, Black, and Wealthy, nigga for that I'm guilty
Still see all the fake shit
It's funny somehow thought the money could erase it
No matter how much dough you got you gotta face it
And to my niggaz gone hope you in a better place
If I make it I'll holla..

[Chorus]
See World (See world, See world)
You're no good
See World (See world, See world)
You're no good
No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds
Can't escape the pain that's trapped in my mind
See World (See world, See world)
You're no good

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah I got a chip on my shoulder the size of a golden nugget
The industry overlook me for that I be holding grudges
Wouldn't take a chance on me
Suddenly it's, oh you love it
Let's get a cole feature that's gon put you over budget
Picture being broke with no pot to piss in
And then suddenly your idols is your competition
Used to be God to me, slowly losing my religion
As these notes from my composition turn the compositions thin
Put it out and hope the World sing
We sippin' liquor for the pain that the World bring
We had dreams just to make it up the flag pole
Just to find out that out heroes were some ass holes
Y'all don't hear me, maybe you had the World figured out wrong
When these niggaz go from singing our songs to waiting on you
Bout a year later the same ones be hatin' on you
Every other record these rappers be faking on you
We singing songs but we know that ain't true
We know you gotta make the people pay you
Cause either you play the game or watch the game play you
And be that broke motherfucker talkin bout "I stay true"

[Chorus]</pre>
