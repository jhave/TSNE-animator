Yo baby
I see you lookin' at me
Word up, just talk to me
And tell me what's on your mind, haha

[Missy]
When I'm alone, I close my eyes
To think of you by my side
When I'm asleep, I always dream
That you and me were doing our own thang
So is it hard for you to stop by my way
And watch a little TV, lay back and conversate

[Sista]
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some time
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some time

[Missy]
Uh, it feels so good when I'm looking in your eyes
Bodies, huggin' it's warm, all this wrapped so tight
Lay back, fantasizing
Of me and you layin' together, realizing

[Sista]
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some time
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some time

[Missy's Rap]
Uh, Scooby-Scooby Doo's got me good in my duty
And I'm checkin' out these cuties
Let me have a man-man nigga booty
Yo I'm checkin' out the fly gear that my bigger nigga's sportin'
He got the new air ?, and I wanna
Yo, Mr. lover wants my body
Cause he see that I'm a hottie, surprise me
And I gotta make 'em cute
And make 'em wanna wanna uh, uh, uh, uh, down my boots
So you best be keepin' your composure
Or turn the motive, I told ya down town means lower
So if you got a problem sugar take your time
Cause if you don't mind baby I don't mind

[Sista]
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some, can spend some time
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some time

[Sista]
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some time
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some time

[Sista]
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some time
I don't mind if you don't mind
Baby we can spend some time</pre>
