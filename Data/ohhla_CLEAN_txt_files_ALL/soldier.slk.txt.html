1st Verse: [Silkk The Shocker &amp; Master P]

[Silkk The Shocker]
See, I'm a N-O, nigga L-I

And yeah, that's me
Tank dog all I wanna be, nigga I told ya

About face for a TRU salute, to my tank dogs

So don't flip me, cuz you'll end up empty
and then I'll reload
and reload, and reload, and reload, and load
whole barrel explode!!!!
Nigga I'm T-R-U, that means I'm TRU 2 Da Game

Now you can do what you wanna
but y'all don't wanna start

cuz y'all don't wanna go to war!!!

[Master P]
No Limit mercenary killas, nigga wit army fatigues

2nd Verse: [Fiend &amp; Lil' Gotti Gambino]

[Fiend]
All my rivals remember me, Fiend

Givin' you hobbies
Gettin' slugs at your own body
for my piece, or Sugar Hill, I'm New Orleans like Lolli
I'm fearin' no man, as long as I'm stompin' in these Broganes
there's no playin', soon as this army stop, ya' got no hands
Damn!!! Ready for war, and keep the weed lighted
if they ain't indicted still, blast it, Fiend the insighted prophet

[C-Murder]
I'm a No Limit soldier, nigga, it's in my blood
I started rappin', so I wouldn't have to sell drugs
We Bout It!!! Muthafuckas representin' them killas
TRU tatted on my back cuz I make moves wit thug niggas
You don't wanna go to war, cuz I'ma bring the brigade

Affiliated with game, totin' thangs that pain
on the corners we hang, and we slangin' the pain!!

Chorus

3rd Verse: [Mystikal, Mac]

[Mystikal]
A helluva, helluva nigga right chea

I'm a cold blooded killa comrade 
and a highly decorated lieutenant
I'm up on the front line, you all the way to the rear
but ya still gettin' injured
NIGGA DON'T YOU KNOW BY NOW THE TANK CAN'T BE DENTED?!!
And when we reach a hundred million cartridges

If I said it, I meant it!!
If I told ya', I showed ya'!!
I'll break y'all, outrank y'all, I'LL MAKE YA' BORN TO BE A SOLDIER!!

[Mac]
Whoa, murder, murder, kill, kill it's real

Nigga, soldier rag still on my eye, no lie

We tattooed, I done gone cashews, ain't no turnin' back

And it get trifer, but I'm a lifer
a camoflauge sniper, from the rooftop I might ignite ya

Chorus

4th Verse: [Lil' Gotti Gambino, Skull Dugrey]

[Lil' Gotti Gambino]
Gotti I told ya', I'm a muthafuckin' soldier

Nationwide exposure, for me and my brethren
for Fiend to bust'em, leavin' my enemies bleedin'
Being a soldier many fourteens, I be needin'
a No Limit soldier, till the day of my leave

[Skull Dugrey]
I been a No Limit soldier since 1994
them niggas know one thing, that Skull broked in the door
They watched me in Waco, as I bring the flow

You know one thing you can't be fuckin' round wit these niggas

You nigga!!! You think, you gonna get away

Chorus

5th Verse: [Big Ed, Mia X]

[Big Ed]
Nigga make some room!!! Nigga, Back up, back up
Forget that thing out the trunk, and act up, act up
Got my tank dogs steppin' camoflauge fatigues
I represent like a loaded weapon, paper bought wit P
When I get that thing, everybody look down and round and round
Got the M-1 spittin' fire, bring yo' set to the ground
Got the C-4 explosives in the black backpack
Big Ed be puttin' down like that!!!!!

[Mia X]
We come strapped in we roll thick
we represent that TRU click
Playa Haters, yeah we know who you are
make infrared shine on your head like the North Star
Bomb shit, boss bitch, mama set it off
let it be known cowards you don't wanna go to war
The hard hitta still be the biggest mama nigga
swallow yo' shit like a fuckin' Anaconda nigga
So, bring it, bring it on, how you wanna do it, what?
Cuz next to other's knees, I cover fuckin' dust
Anten-Hut nah, take it to the battle field
shoppers gon run, while we kick our enemies doors
I ask the lord, they don't want no more?
Mama, drama, told ya' No Limit done took over

Chorus

[Silkk]
I thought I told ya
Pass the doja
GAME OVER!!!!!</pre>
