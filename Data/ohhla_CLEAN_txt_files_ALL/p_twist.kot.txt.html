That's life, that's the way it goes 
Layin' down laws and taxin' ho's 
Sometimes I can't take no more 
Always leaving shows through the back door 

What you got D-Toke? 
Now what you got ST? 
Teach me how to get my mack to a T 
First of all, I put that pimp twist on her 
Then I let her know that I'm a P-Town baller 
Next thing you know, you see I get no rejection 
High in charisma, smooth-ass complexion 
I'm Daddy X and I come with correction 
You know there's infection, so wear some protection 
Ain't nobody slicker than B-Dub on the mixer 
Don't bring your girlfriend 'round because he's down to get with her 
Fool what you barkin', it must be the liquor 
I'm back on your bitch so stick around like a sticker 
Naw, but I'm quicker cuz I'm the D-L-O-C 
All the freaks know me, they call me Loc Daddy 
I rock shit on the daily, your girlfriend she paged me 
I bust you in the grill, then go chill with your lady 

It's the pimp twist, it's the pimp twist 
Yeah, yeah, pimpin ain't easy! 

That's life, that's the way it goes 
Layin' down laws and taxin' hos 
Sometimes I can't take no more 
Always leaving shows through the back door 

Yo I'm Saint Dub, and known to drink some brandy 
I gots the foul whistle cuz it comes in handy 
I once knew this bitch by the name of Candy 
But he kicked her out because the punani was sandy 
Saint Dog kicked her out, Daddy X took her in 
Massengil, Summer's Eve, then I sexed her skin 
No girlfriend because they're too damn hectic 
I only like the ones that are down to get naked 
Well Loc knew Candy, I knew that bitch 
I took her out once, made her think I'm rich 
Romance, slow dance, made her feel great 
And at the end of the night I worked that ass like a slave 
Loc did you call her? I didn't bend a wrist 
Fool, I thought you knew it's the fucking pimp twist 

It's the pimp twist, it's the pimp twist 
Kottonmouth is the crew that the ladies miss 
Yes, they down with this, and so they reminisce 
About the day they were caught up in the pimp twist 

That's life, that's the way it goes 
Layin' down laws and taxin' hos 
Sometimes I can't take no more 
Always leaving shows through the back door 

Now P-Town ballers is the name I claim 
Been through many cities and it's all the same 
I see a freak, I look in her direction 
5 minutes later she'll be licking my erection 
Now I'm not a cock blocker like you might suppose 
Just a game I run on these mother fucking hos 
Like I once knew this girl named Vanessa, I undressed her 
Last December, or November. Was it September? 
I'm a stoner reeking havoc, I don't remember, shit! 

Hold your seat 
Let me take you to another plateau 
Exhilaration of your mind comes with my flow 
Really though, I'll let you know I'm that boy ST 
Exposing your mind to the rhymes of a P-Town baller 
I'll make your girl holler my name in pain as I proceed to call her 
My versatile machine on my new found lady 
Hit it once and she'll be down to pay me 
No babies cuz I elect to protect 
From that HIV shit if my dick gets erect, so check 
After I'm through, it's out the door, I thought you knew 
I'm a P-Town Baller, fool I gotta tell the crew 

It's the pimp twist, it's the pimp twist 
Kottonmouth make a sweet girl turn a trick 
And yes, she's down with this, and so she'll reminisce 
About the days she was caught up in the pimp twist 

Perpetrator? Naw, educator 
Playa hata? More like a generator 
Hesitater? Naw, demonstrator 
Masturbator? Naw, masticator on you old lady's twat 
The shit was hot, the pussy got got, I hit the G-spot 
My other buddy ate it, his tongue got rot 
But he knew what he was in for when the booze got bought 
Now that's not a lot but that's food for thought 
You gotta bur up if she's hot to trot 
Like it or not you need to smoke more pot 
And think about your problems, connect the dots 

That's life, that's the way it goes 
Layin' down laws and taxin' hos 
Sometimes I can't take no more 
Always leaving shows through the back door 
With the dirty ho, through the back door 
Took the little skeezy to the mo-mo 
And now it's oh no about the info 
Gotta keep the shit on the down low 
On the down low, about the info 
Gotta keep the shit on the down low </pre>
