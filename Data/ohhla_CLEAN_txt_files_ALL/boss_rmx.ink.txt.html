Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Okay
Bossin' up
You, you can check we bossin'
Yeah

[Chorus: x2]
V-v-valet park my whip nigga (uh)
Hammer time for my chips nigga
Bossin' up, add it up
Your girlfriend choosin' so you mad as fuck, okay
Chillin' with my coalition nigga's rackin' up
Bossin' up, add it up
Bossin' up, add it up
A lil' Louis but my bitch wants some bags and stuff

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
It go, valet when I park it
OG when I spark it
Money speak when I'm talkin'
J-J's on when I'm walking
Stay fired up like arson
You can't touch my garments
Up late nights pass Carson
Drinkin' large proportions of that turn up, juice
Got your girlfriend, loose
Shakin' that ass listening to Luke
Give a nigga all hole no loops
Give a nigga all brain no lip
I be at the ball hanging no grip
Pants saggin' on four fifth
My security bullets like 4 inches
Kick that shit like four ninjas
Did that shit for my niggas who
Made it out the hood to the good side
B-bossin' up with no tie
You heard it through the grapevine
And I was actually there
Yeah, It's clear who's been gettin' to the bread like Panera, ugh

[Chorus: x2]
V-v-valet park my whip nigga (uh)
Hammer time for my chips nigga
Bossin' up, add it up
Your girlfriend choosin' so you mad as fuck, okay
Chillin' with my coalition nigga's rackin' up
Bossin' up, add it up
Bossin' up, add it up
A lil' Louis but my bitch wants some bags and stuff

[Verse 2: French Monatana]
You know it's Mr. Haaanhh
Ferg what's happening

Owwww, Hannn
Bossed up in this bitch
Got my golds up in this bitch
Don't get tossed up in this bitch
I'm like owwww, hannnn
Coke Boys in this bitch (hannn)
Got Kid Ink up in this bitch (hannn)
Got ASAP Ferg in this bitch (ay, ay, ay)
I'm like (owww) hunit on that stage nigga
Hunnit in them them K's nigga
In that Porsche, boxed up, stunting 'till-my grave nigga
Strapped with the 40, shit real out chea
Talking about the purpose smoking fills outchea (han)
Stingy with the money, but the shells I shed
And my nigga rip the gold off ya grill out chea
Pull up in a tank (tank), cup full of drank (drank)
Make 10 mill, stuff it in a bank (bank)
50 on a rollie, 100 on a lane (bling)
Think you an animal turn you to a mank (woo)
Throwing dust, throwing bullets (bullt), stunting on the po pull up
Top-off, car-hooded, this-South-Bronx-boogie
Owwww

[Chorus: (x2)]

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Uh
Hello nigga with the gold teeth
Hilfiger nigga, only OG
Hilfiger niggas, only 4D
But for real, a trilla' nigga bring the whole street
Four trill bitches on my Rollie
Montana hammer, like I'm Tony
Cocaina âtil her nose bleed
Make a girl wanna cuff like the police
That flacko nigga goldie
Me and Rocky like Apollo Creed
Relax to the max, no cozy
Big dogs on the crib but I'm low-key
Don't fuck with them niggas that be phony
Young B XXX don't even know me
She all on my wang, Alexander Wang
Yeah, Margiela feel the leather - 4G
These Ape's on my feet, make my cypher complete
Make girls scream "Lord" like I am a priest
I'm a boss nigga, climbing seas
Just collect cash while designing sneaks
Whip yo teeth every time I speak
3 thou for the smile, nigga I'm a G
Better talk to me nice, nigga I'm a chief
You dealing with a boss, so I need PC
Yeah, I'm bout this bread
I'm bout this dough
I'm bout this dough
Ooooo-ooo, ooooo, ooooo

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Kid Ink]
Keep it 1 hunnit
1 hunnit in one's
If you tryna have some fun
Funds up get you some
The sum of it all (all), all this money in my draw (yeah)
Draw these hoes to my car (egh)
Add it up, how I ball (go)
Yeah that's bossin' up, but don't bother us
Steady poppin' in, so popular
Love poppin' shit, its Rocketship
Might take off, so out of here (here)
Here we go again (gain), given in to sin
So sincere since last night, til 6 going in
Sun shine, see the glare (glare), no we ain't playing fare (no)
And you ain't really bout that paper, if it ain't enough to share (what)
Acting like I been on vacation, tell a mother fucker I ain't going no where
On my own, playing the cards like the game is solitaire, yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro: fading out] Bags and stuff [x6]</pre>
