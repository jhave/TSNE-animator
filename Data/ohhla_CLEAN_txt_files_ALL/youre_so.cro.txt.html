Baby you're so bad it hurts my heart
Good job god, shes a work of art
I observe your mini skirt

thats a perfect start

money with no quarter piece, what does it mean
Are you Beyonce's cousin, Ashanti's aunti?
A body like that, got a butt in your jeans
Baby girl just step in my little office
We skaten on 28's we real Bosses
my whips is so hot, she feel nautious
The Desert E on deck,  I'm still cautious
I thought I told ya, I hop out the Rover
These fly chicks love a Long Beach Soldier
Even these whiners offer me ??
Keep the sela ropa???!? lol

Girl the way you movin

But I know I can handle it
Baby Your So Bad
