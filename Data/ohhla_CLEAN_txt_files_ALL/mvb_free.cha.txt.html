[Chamillionaire]
You know that feelin' you get when you in love, what do ya call it?
I don't know but I only feel like that when I open my wallet
Wanna be hard..retards actin' like they ain't fraud
Open ya mouth so I can drag my feet and cut my yard
Broke niggaz always tryna tell ya how to get a dollar
Shut up when the heat holla, run hollow tips follow
Like prank callers..yall niggaz need to hang it up
I know Biggie, I'll take his Shyne like ya nickname was Puff
Ay, controversy sells..and I know I was wrong
But you bia bia's need to listen to that Lil' Jon song
This ain't no sisqo thong song, we the voice of the streets
So in order to keep the peace, gotta keep a piece
Just kiddin', don't touch guns, guns will kill
And that's real, when you still use ya dumb tongue to squill
Don't get mad, don't take everything seriously
But if ya rap and lookin' for a rapper to fear, it's me
Chamillion the Mixtape Messiah, get duct-taped and tie ya
to the table, open ya mouth and make ya eat barbed wire
sandwich, man this boy got to be signed
If he's not, then Russell want me to sign his dotted-line
Nope, maybe next time, underground I'm found
Sharks swimmin' in the dark, ya talk down now drown
So I'ma continue, to rule move get out the way
While the chrome metal 'copter blades keep spinnin' for days</pre>
