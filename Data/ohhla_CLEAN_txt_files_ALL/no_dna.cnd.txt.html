(Humpty Hump)
Yo Num, open up, hurry up, Humpty Hump mane
Unlock the door mane
I think she's dead, I left her on the floor mane

(Numskull)
I'm comin' nigga, damn, you too loud, shut the fuck up
I got neighbors nigga

(Humpty Hump)
Fuck that!  You gotta save a nigga!

(Numskull)
What?  The fat thing I gave you?
Where the fuck you take it?

(Humpty Hump)
That's what I'm sayin'!  Let me in!  She ain't make it!

(Numskull)
Dude, I thought you took her home?

(Humpty Hump)
Uh-uh, that bitch is gone

(Numskull)
WHAT????!!!!!

(Humpty Hump)
Aight, we stopped at Burger King on the way home
Both of us get high, while we was waitin' on the food
Yo, you won't believe this Dude
I took her in the bathroom, did my thug thing in her mouth
Then she went limp and passed the fuck out!!!!!

(Numskull)
I'm down, let's go get her and bring her here

(Humpty Hump)
But she had no pulse, her heartbeat I couldn't hear

(Numskull)
What the fuck you mean no heartbeat and no pulse????!!!!

(Humpty Hump)
She's DEAD nigga!  That's why the fuck I got GHOST
I noticed somethin' though
She was on somethin' yo
What you gave her?

(Numskull)
She came over with some high-ass behavior!

(Humpty Hump)
Well I'm bout to go and get her
My D-N-A up in her
I would ask you to go, but fuck it you know, you ain't hit her

(Numskull)
What you gone do with her?

(Humpty Hump)
I'ma dump her in the river

(Numskull)
What?

(Humpty Hump)
Uh, uh, uh, I don't know what to do, I'm stank

(Numskull)
I'm goin' too, you can't just take the case by yourself

(Humpty Hump)
You fucked?

(Numskull)
I wanted to help her with her health!
I gave her Vitamin C, D, E, and F too
Throat was so laced, she couldn't have even caught the flu
But she really wanted you, when I got her from Clee
I just did what I had to do and got a quickie

(Humpty Hump)
A fuckin' quickie?
You in it with me
And if you got her from Clee
That hoe is probably full of Hen and ecstacy
And if I know Clee, that's D-N-A sample number three
The only way we'll know what's up, we gotta get Clee

Chorus (all):

Can't be leavin' D-N-A,  No way!
We gotta carry her and bury her
There can't be nothin' scarier
Then we get the fuck outta town, on the next United Shuttle
Aight, who got the shovels?

(Humpty Hump)
Which way?

(Numskull)
You know where Clee live
Right there, knock on the door

(Humpty Hump)
Shiiiiiiiiit

(Numskull)
Ay Clee, we in some shit, what you do to this chick?
She dropped dead on Hump, nigga where you bump this bitch?

(Clee)
Man I ain't bump this bitch, a friend of mine knew her
THE FUCK YOU MEAN SHE DEAD?  WHAT Y'ALL DO TO HER????

(Humpty Hump)
All I did was tickle her

(Clee)
Nigga put that on your pimp coat!

(Humpty Hump)
Well my dick did the ticklin' in the back of her throat

(Numskull)
Ay come on, let's go get the shovels man we gotta move fast!

(Humpty Hump)
My nut's still in her stomach

(Numskull)
Me, uterus

(Clee)
Me, ass

(Humpty Hump + Numskull simulataneously)
You what?  I ain't know you fucked???!!!!

(Clee)
Ssssssssssssshhhhhh!!!!!!!  Would y'all shut the fuck up???!!!
Gotta figure this shit out, come on we need a plan
I got some shelves in the basement, y'all gimme a hand
Now where this fat bitch at?

(Humpty Hump)
Burger King

(Clee)
What you mean?

(Humpty Hump)
You know....Burger King

(Numskull)
Stupid!
This what I'm thinkin' about, the scene already boilin'
He left the bitch on the Burger King toilet spoilin'

(Clee)
Somebody must've found her, that was hours ago

(Humpty Hump)
No, I closed the stall door and put her feet on the floor
But hold on, now how we supposed to get her to the car?

(Clee)
I bought three duffle bags, an axe, and a hacksaw

(Numskull)
Aight we here, Hump, you killed her, so you chop her

(Humpty Hump)
