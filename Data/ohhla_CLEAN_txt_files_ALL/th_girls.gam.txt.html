[Childish Gambino]
We are really close, and this party's really loud
We should go outside and talk, better yet let's take a cab
We're kissing in the back, my apartment's pretty close
Baby let me make you breakfast, an omelette with some toast
These girls are on my mind, wasn't my design
to be sitting here across from you pretending I ain't lyin
I know exactly how you feel, I wanna keep it real
I never thought that I'd be working for the start cause

[Chorus]
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
I know this thing will never last
I need to tear it all apart
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I can lose it all

[Childish Gambino]
I don't have the heart, fuck it I don't have the head
Every time that we're apart, someone's sleepin in my bed
I wanna be alone, I wanna be alone
This fame and fortune shit, shows me things I wasn't knownin
You're my biggest fan, I promise to be there
I wanna be that guy, but I don't think I can
I'm losin everything, I wanna let it go
I wanna take it right and slow; because

[Chorus]
