Have you ever been ambushed?

Chorus
Every time I write a rhyme
you know it's tight
People say B-L-A-Q you out of sight
Yo chiki chiki high chiko
comin' through 'bout to do the impossible
(Repeat)

Verse 1
Never test B-L-A-Q the six footer
you tried to call my bluff How could ya?
Frontin' when you ain't got straps
Why would ya?
cuttin' hard core &amp; ya tank's full of sugar
You can never compare to rhymes I write
my style is ferocious &amp; I'm gettin' ?? for tonight
Groupies in my hotel lobby I'm hittin' on 'em
niggas try to take my reign I'm shittin' on 'em
As is I'm trippin' on 'em tracks I'm flippin' on 'em
niggas ain't satisfied 'til my weapon is spittin' on 'em
Everytime I bust mine your soul burn
you niggas yearn to learn my flows spread the germs
Makin' you squirm any MC can get his ass beat
blowin' up the spot in spite of the last beef
Chiki ko ya highest title ya numero uno
My wife is Puerto Rican so we speak in ??
nationality noo it don't matter where you rest
you can still catch verbal slugs to ya chest
You niggas tryin' to front like you hard as cold steel
"The Sweetest Thing," I've ever known is Bourbon Hills

Chorus

Verse 2
Who the most John Blaze?
and who John Doe?
I'm too hot chiki chiki ahh chiki o
Unfadeable (Yo) top dollar
when I bark I bite rougher than Rottweiler
pull around here I'm buckin' your Impala
My entourage is large like Kamala
The women holler I lay my game down sick
Heeyyy stick it up in yo' girl so I'm quick
tickle it hee hee hee hee hee Who I be?
A    P to the I to the M to the P
Lyrically y'all haters should not test
I'm too laced ice on my wrist to chest
you talkin' shit when you never progress
I'm a excel until I have no goals left I'm gone

Chorus	

B-L-A-Q's gonna make you dance
Ambush gonna make you dance
What what come on
M-O double B's gonna make you dance
Dontell wanna make you dance

Every time I write a rhyme
you know it's tight
People say B-L-A-Q you out of sight
Yo chiki chiki high chiko
comin' through 'bout to do the impossible
(Repeat)

A to the M-B-U-S-H Ambush baby
A to the M-B-U-S-H never forgets (that's us)
A to the M-B-U-S-H uhh that's us that's us
Ha haa uh uhh uhh A to the M-B-U-S-H
