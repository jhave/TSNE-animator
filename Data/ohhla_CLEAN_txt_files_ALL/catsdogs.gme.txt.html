[Intro]
Welcome to the Republic, of Cali-i-for-nia
While you're here, you can get updates

at DJ Skee - I can't say his name!
Y'all ain't gon' get me in trouble, hehe
Facebook, Twitter, @TheGame
@DJSkee, follow us! As we lead you with this

[Chorus: Kobe]
Not what you feared then bitch
You gon' learn to shut yo' mouth
Cause we gon' eat now, now
Now, now
Fuck yo' feelings bitch
Just gon' huff yo' acid here
and roll this shit 'round
Hold this shit down
Come move them thangs for me babyyyyy
Across town, town
And make sure they touch down
Eeee, ahhh, just make it in town
Then make sure they touch down
Touch down

[The Game]
Uh-huh; I need a gangster bitch nigga I ain't lyin
I'm talkin when I fuck she scream, you hear sirens
No domestic violence (violence)
Just domestic diamonds
So let me ice you out so when you slidin down the pole
doin your Magic City thing yo' neck and wrist glow
I'm dreamin, she ain't a stripper, she a classy girl
Gon' off that Patron, she my nasty girl
First name Rachal, last name Jones
You related to Nas? Girl, Queens my second home
You know you, +Prince Akeem+ come with a +Semi+ we can tear it up
Weekend in Cannes, then we +Coming to America+
Wear them Jimmy Chus but she love that Gucci
Never been to A-T-L but she love that +Gucci+ (brrr~!)
She taught me how to cook Cajun, I taught her how to cook crack
and I chopped it on her back, now tell me where they do that?

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I put her on a Greyhound, she know she better stay down
Ride or die like my Bentley man this bitch'll never break down
She my "Bust It Baby," you should see her bust a trey pound
Love Roc-A-Fella so much she won't even call me Jay now
She roll my weed man, like she my wingman
Then we get high, play Tiger Woods on that weed damn
Love is four season, haters 365
In the game cats and dogs, keep your bitch by your side
Got a hardtop Lambo' when the rain start to pour
Not the rain outside, talkin the rain indoors
Her girlfriend told her, that I was creepin with a stripper
Told her I was courtside, watchin the whack ass Clippers
Bitch please! I'm a Laker fan, and Kobe that's my nigga
Keep my grass cut so I can see when the snake slither
Shit came out of nowhere like Khloe and Lamar
Kinda got a nigga thinkin maybe I'm

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I let her drive the Range on our first date
She the first one to put me on that Drake mixtape
"I just wanna be successful baby"
Take you out them Hudson Jeans and redress you baby
We can walk down Rodeo, turn around, you on Melrose
Fly to New York in the winter and try on some Timbos
or we can hit South Beach, fuck with Ross and Timbo
The world is cherry pie and we can +Slice+ it up like +Kimbo+
You cook the rock, I break it down, I wrap it up, you weigh them pounds
I make the car, you start the car, we can drive it out of town
I'm your nigga right? And you my bitch (yeah)
Even if they lock me up, she gon' get them brakes there
When we get tired, we hit the truck stop and sit there
And zip my 501's and, she gon' put her lips there
The memoirs of a perfect bitch
You gotta hold them down even if it's

[Chorus]</pre>
