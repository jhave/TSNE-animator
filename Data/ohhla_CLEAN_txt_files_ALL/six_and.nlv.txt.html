Chillin' on the set with the fully automatic tec
Never was caught slippin' that's how I got my respect

With a forty in my hand and about to get tore

For them jokin' mutherfuckers who be doin' drivebys
For them pussy ass niggas I've been try'na kill
I got a bullet proof vest and it's made of steel
For you sissy ass niggas thinkin' they hard

When a nigga's on the set we makin' money again
Drinkin' forty red bullets smokin' boo-koo weed

Third Verse
{Yella Boy}

Here come's an hard head rapper bout to crush yo phone
My name is Yella Boy no not Sylvester Stallion
Born and raised in third because that's my home
There's not another gangster set like 6th and Baronne
Because the bitches peepin' out seven days a week
I wait for the first and third to get paid ya see
My boys in rumors creepin' up but I just don't care
This is live or die sucker no not you thug there
I ride on other gangsters turf and need a gangsta's fit
Cash Money means ya got to stay legit
Throwin' paper in the air a quarter now an ounce
Then I call my dog bitch take her to Wall Street and make her bow
All the gangsters in the hood be up to no good
Pack the mutherfuckin' chrome smoke boo-koo weed now ya feel good
I'm down for a gangster strap can't you tell 
I know a buildin' down with me of the Melph a Mene and Del a Rell
Tec-9, Lil' Ya me myself Yella Boy we all third ward soldiers
Not no child or little boys I'm makin' big bank and packin' the chrome
(Why) Because I'm a gangster from 6th and Baronne

Chorus

I say boot up or shut up or
Get yo fuckin' life lit up

Forth Verse
{Tec-9}

Growin' up was hard but it all paid off well
I was only eleven when I started to sell
6th and Baronne was the set that I sold rocks
Drinks done went crazy because I'm servin' the block
Now I'm on the run I guess I got to go
I slipped and sold to an undercover five-o 
They say they got a reward if ya know where I'm at
But I'm gonna make it hard for 'em because I'm packin' a gat
Now I never was the type to run away from my home (why)
Because I'm a nigga from 6th and Baronne

I say boot up or shut up or
Get yo fuckin' life lit up
Yeah yeah yeah wootay

Fifth Verse
{Lil' Ya}

I was chillin' on the corner strapped with the fuckin' chrome
Makin' boo-koo money on 6th and Baronne 
All the junkies gather around and come see the man
I got big twenty flippers and za peter in my other hand
B 3 by my side he got dope to in a long fuckin' Lincoln
Yes he strapped with a twenty two 
Tec is in the house chillin' with Moe
While Kerri on the floor doggin' doggin'
Doggin' a ho Chella's in the house chillin'
With Lamb while Ronda with Keisha
With them bitches they don't give a damn
Gettin' her haircut from Sue Tyra got a bitch
You know what to do Baby is on there other end
Stun'n on the pay phone and I'm chillin' on
6th and Baronne

Sixth Verse
{Yella Boy}

I got to watch my damn back 
For the robbers and the gangsters 
Like in the fuckin' pin I draw my knife
Then I shank ya because I know I got to handle that
Because some niggas try'na creep up bests believe I got my gat
You will never catch me slippin' cuz the leather keep flippin'
Try to play and my product man ya must be trippin'
Cuz a gangster out that third pushin' to much pain
Comin' weak that ho shit bitch you a rookie at the game
There's a dollar to made so best believe a playa call it 
Disrespect my damn set watch yo back against the puppet
I'm takin' no shorts in the game of dope ya better come correct
Sucker cuz this shit ain't no joke that boo-koo money in land

Just to be then nigga again because I'm makin' big bank

From 6th and Baronne
