[Intro - J-Kwon]
(HRRR! HRRR! HRRR! HRRR!)
I can do it too, hrr hrr hrr
(HRRR! HRRR! HRRR! HRRR!)
I can do it, hrr, hrr! hrr!

[Verse - J-Kwon]
Now errbody in this place is high as me
So why the hell is you over therre eyein' me?
Peeps wit me, I know you ain't tryin' to leave
If you is, I'll show you how live I be
My bad... did I pull your freak?
Where my bird at? go hide, I'll seek
Yeah I'm signed, don't get caught in the hype
If you do, watch how quick I'll be like.

[Hook - J-Kwon]
MOTHERFUCK THIS! MOTHERFUCK THAT!
FUCK THAT BITCH! FUCK THAT CAT!
Derty, I ain't the type to like to talk a lot
I got somethin' for your ass in the parking lot
MOTHERFUCK THIS! MOTHERFUCK THAT!
FUCK THAT BITCH! FUCK THAT CAT!
Derty, once I get you to the parking lot
I got somethin' for your ass that'll spark a lot

[Verse - J-Kwon]
Seriously, we can be real with the flow
J-Kwon, deal with the flow
Want beef? 'cause I make money
All 'cause my watch's face is shaped funny
Look doggs, watch what ya sayin'
I put that on my mama and I'm not playin'
Trip, get hit when the time right
It's around 3 o' clock I don't know if the time right
Yo, why ya boy buggin' me?
Hell, gon' girl quit buggin me
Would've been hollered if you wasn't ug-ly
But dude fin' to get hit with this bubb-ly
Oh you buckin' up? bop, beep
Toss, cocked, quick it's gettin' ug-ly!
Trickin' wit' me, 'cause you want the spotlight
Not if it's got to be like.

[Hook - J-Kwon]
MOTHERFUCK THIS! MOTHERFUCK THAT!
FUCK THAT BITCH! FUCK THAT CAT!
Derty, I ain't the type to like to talk a lot
I got somethin' for your ass in the parking lot
MOTHERFUCK THIS! MOTHERFUCK THAT!
FUCK THAT BITCH! FUCK THAT CAT!
Derty, once I get you to the parking lot
I got somethin' for your ass that'll spark a lot

[Verse - J-Kwon]
Derty...I don't like to talk a lot
I got 2 words for ya: Parking Lot
He mad, 'cause the way we win in the spot
Our sidekicks came out, he got a 10 in the spot
Okay..he ran in the spot
Do they make him wrong or right? right to wrong
You hatin' because of hatas I invented this song
Mother...oh I supposed to keep going?
Idiot, we all know the album droppin'
I'm for real wit the clips, I got 'em on and poppin'
Dude, they can hit ya daughter like me
Just bought a gun, it's a new artist like me
Rare? forget ya the minute you step wrong
Fall down on the ground, you hear the step song
You wanna bang? we ain't even gotta fight
If we do, watch how quick it be like.

[Hook - J-Kwon] - x2
MOTHERFUCK THIS! MOTHERFUCK THAT!
