Well it's the super duper Snoopa once again I'm on the fly
Swoopin through I'm in my coupe and all the bitches want a ride
If it's trippin like I'm clippin I'm still grippin on my nine
We be Crip'n while I'm dippin with my C's up in the sky
And the East is still my side, I'm a reaper when I ride
Fuck a feature, I don't need a motherfucker, I'm the guy
I delete 'em, stampede 'em, straight eat 'em like some fries
Get a ketchup, get 'em messed up, turn the heat up let 'em fry
Ain't no different when I'm rippin, pimpin's still up in his prime
TV shows, movie hoes, pimpin's still up on his grind
Man these hoes don't know, I'm workin with a nine
I ain't talkin 'bout a gun, I'm talkin feel it in your spine
when I hit it from behind, if I go up in your mouth
I might hit you in the mind, you know what I'm talkin 'bout
It'll thrill ya, I'm the stealer that'll kill ya with the rhythm of a trigger
Motherfucker better duck before I hit her, bang!
 
[Chorus]
Dogg-y Dogg, is all, you need
So love, the Dogg, like we, love weed
(Breathe in) Breathe in (breathe out) let it out
(Breathe in) Breathe in (breathe out) let it out
(Breathe in) Breathe in (breathe out) let it out
(Breathe in) Breathe in (breathe out) let it out
 
[Snoop Dogg]
You niggaz mad cause I done came and crept up back up on the scene
This is bye, retire, I'm still spittin gasoline
I'm a gangsta motherfucker what the fuck you think that means?
Little nigga I'm the king, I ain't givin up a thing
If you want it come and take it nigga, I'll be sittin waitin
Make a patient nigga got the other ear and I'll bake a nigga
Fuck it put the gun down, and straight bank a nigga
Take it nigga, take it nigga fuck, you ain't this nigga
.. Slow down my turbo flow
.. Inhale my doe-doe smoke
.. Okay I let the fo'-fo' blow
And the po-po know, that's why they on my dick
And they at my crib, tryin to find my shit
Tryin to search my house, what the fuck that's 'bout?
I ain't givin up shit, you can search that bitch
I ain't got nuttin Jack; get the fuck on back
 
[Chorus]  2X</pre>
