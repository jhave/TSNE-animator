[K-oS]
My heart, creep show
Same old thing on the radio
Who's that coming 'round
Suffering popularity breakdown
I can't it's funny that
That I got stopped when I'm walking the streets
Walking down streets, walking down paths 
With the kids in the back way I said 
If you can't dance to this it doesn't matter
If you can't dance to this it doesn't matter
I was running around with my head in the sand
Looking for pupil in a new fan
She told me before, baby do your own dance
Stay off the highway

[Chorus: K-oS]
That doesn't mean you were born to run
Either we're vain or we're broken hearted
We don't believe in a heaven above
That's why we're back to the place that we started
That doesn't mean you were born to run
Either we're vain or we're broken hearted
As sure as the stars in the skies above
We're going back to the place that we started

[K-oS]
We fell from sky and universe
When we fell in love with the sound
Of the birds and all the ocean likes
And the gravity pulling us down
Time won't let you go
There are some things you'll never know
I'm hoping that she walks through the door
I'm in ?...
If the sky would fall 
Will it take that to bring us together?
Do we have to start all over again?

[Chorus: K-oS]
That doesn't mean you were born to run
Either we're vain or we're broken hearted
We don't believe in a heaven above
That's why we're back to the place that we started

[K-oS]
Born to run until we fell in love
Born to run until we fell
Born to run until we fell in love
Born to run until we fell...
My heart, creep show
Same old thing on the radio
Who's that coming 'round?
Suffering popularity breakdown
I think it's funny that
That I got harassed when I'm walking the streets
Walking down streets, walking down paths 
With the kids in the back way I said 
If you can't dance to this it doesn't matter
If you can't dance to this it doesn't matter
I was running around with my head in the sand
Looking for a pupil in a new fan
Told me before, baby do your own dance
Stay off the highway</pre>
