Yo, check me in
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now

[Lecrae]
Check me in
I know I'm sick and my addiction got me itchin
Everyday I need a fixin
I ain't quittin till it kill me
Ya hear me, I like the feel but hate the taste of the product
Like the numb on the tongue when you taste narcotics
The bass gets to bumpin
you can feel what I'm drummin
Death is comin', I'm tryna warn 'em
That's why I was summoned
I know that they don't want it, they want what they can't have
Euphoria come and go but it's something you can't grasp
Yeah, we're grasping for the emptiness, hoping we can catch something
Hand full of scars, cuts, burns, as the flesh wants
Verge of insanity, stop me 'for I'm gone
I say I'm gon quit but I'm at it in the morn
It goes on and on and on and now I'm used to it
This a lifestyle now and I don't know what else to do
Got a war inside my soul and it's wantin to break through
I'm ready for Rehab, jus' do what ya gon do

Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab

(Aye, aye, aye, aye)
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now

Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
