[Chorus: x2]
I'm checkin out yo lifestyle, oh you a trojan
I know you hopin' that you get chosen
I like 'em frozen, icy wit the platinum
I need a nigga wit a gold package magnum

{Verse 1: Gangsta Boo}
Aye sexy wetman you don't wan test me
Ride ya ass to sleep since you doin all dat flexin
Magnum XL, but I don't kiss an tell cut a few rappers but its cool cuz dats my business hell
Jeezy, T.I., Young Buck, Supa Fly
Dope boyz from tha trap raise ya hands real high
Lifestyle (uh uh) black package magnum
Thicky thick girlz in this jump Rasheeda supa crunk

{Verse 2: Rasheeda}
Gold pack or the black pimpin I can handle that
We can do the damn thang yean ain't gotta hold back
Lam skin boy naw, it's like goin raw dawg
Burn Rasheeda up mess around an kill all y'all
I kno wat the busness is XL, sensitive
Got me makin cut faces wit dat heat sensation (naww)
Playa we ain't got no conversation
Less ya rockin platinum, or wear gold magnum

[Chorus x2]

{Verse 3: Princess}
Step up in to club niggaz choosin tryna get in my jeanz
I'm too cute fo you but yo friend can come teach me some things
Fuck the motion in tha ocean cuz the niggaz gotta have a boat
If his dick too small then shit will sink and it can never float
I'm not tryna boast but tha shit like me ? ? ?.
Fuck a trogan I need magnums real niggaz can understand
If you can't fulfill my needs then hit tha road I gotta go, Rasheeda, Diamond, Princess, Booty tho we come back fo more

{Verse 4: Diamond}
(Yea) Spluge me, take me, Diamonds so sexy
I ain't even 18 and daddys wan date me
But I rather stick ta pimpin wit good grane grippin Im a mack
Catch a quicky then I'm outtie yea wont doubt he bring it back
Jus tha fact that I don't love 'em leads to trouble if he mean to me
Gold package magnum wit tha platinum cuz I need a G
This how it be, if you want to fulfill all my fantasies
I have you on yo bended knee you fuckin wit the baddest bitch

[Chorus x2]

{Verse 5: Rasheeda}
X L, Wrap it up
Then break a bitch off, dats what's up
Can you give it to me right

I ain't got no time fo kids
I don't fuck wit minutes men

{Verse 6: Princess}
I don't eitha please believe it
If you small then Im gon leave ya
Princess needa thug to please her
Put it down an be my teacher
Punish me but nicely
I'm sexy sweet an spicy
Niggaz love me
But them hoes always wan fight me

{Verse 7: Diamond}
Ya know I'm spicy (spicy)
I like my niggaz icy
They youngest out the click
But they I'm stading quite pricy
I might be the type chick ya wanna make ya wifey
Enticin, dat why yo baby momma don't like me

{Verse 8: Gangsta Boo}
If you ain't sized up please get tha fuck up
You be wastin all my time, I guess yo ass is outta luck
Time is up, now you stuck
You aint' a lifestyle
Movin real fast, ain't goin no where
I guess you jus a while child now.

[Chorus x2]
