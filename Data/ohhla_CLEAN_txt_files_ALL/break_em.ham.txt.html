Chorus (8x): (Q-tip)
If you say Hammer Proper
(Hammer)
We about to break em off somethin Proper

Once again it's on!
You nigga's tried to dis me
You missed me
Chill G, For real G
Man u nigga's kill me
Tryin to knock me off the top
Yo there's no contest G in the market
Ya'll hata's never ? me
As I deliver, hits too make em quiver
Make em shiver, Q-tip couldn't flow if he was a river
And me, I'm sellin milli like runnin the mill
And like Big Daddy Kane "I Wonder How You Gotta Record Deal"
Well everyday too make hits, you ain't got it
Til this day you never ? never had it
For me I tend to kick it like a partner
And must I remind you I'm the funky headhunter
I understand u bout as man as Rupaul
I come on your block and move you out like a U-Haul
So step right up and be the next contestant
A Tribe Called Quest Is A Bad Investment
I'm breakin em off with somethin proper!

Chorus (4x)

Like Hardaway boy I got skills
Like 7up you never had it never will
You talkin that mess punk
I see that Kriss Kross couldn't make U jump (now they don't want funk)
Your wack album out be doin
they done bullshit u gotta go gotta go
So pick the time and the place if u ever wanna Warren G
Cause you could stay if u was Jodeci (Do u wanna Just Stay!)
And get your sexual protection
Or I'ma have your head in that played out rapper's collection

(2 Bigg MC)
Just like pennies rap Lights Out!
I Advise u keep his name out yo mouth
Cause you probably dis hammer fast son
Get out when u can or catch a bad one

(Hammer)
You better believe that I'm droppin you

(2 Bigg MC)
Right on yo ass!

(MC Hammer)
We breakin em off wit somethin proper!

Chorus (6x)

Like the rest you was tryin to get paid
These days you walkin around the Raid
Cause I'm known to blow em away like a hand grenade

(2 Bigg MC)
We don't contest with them punks that ain't in our league
And with the slangity bees

(MC Hammer)
Fool please!
I'm a high speed B-boy nuff said
The funky headhunter so I can't get enough head!

(2 Bigg MC)
Dis me I'll sit your ass in the tortuary
I'm makin your home a mortuary

(MC Hammer)
I'm so hyped to make you seat like a sedative
You didn't sign to another crew had to be a relative

(Suge Knight)
You all about as real as yo gel fro
For you we had know use 
So we gone execute you like Death Row

(MC Hammer)
So don't misunderstand
I was a Menace 2 Society
When ya'll were Little Boys In Da Hood

(Suge)
I rearranged your effects like the doctor

(MC Hammer)
When you bust my badge
You better fell the raft
We breakin em off with somethin proper!

I'm sendin this to all my women!
All them girls that gotta say Daddy Hammer's name 
when they in the studio

Redman!  
You punk you trick I like the way u say Daddy Hammer's name

(Suge Knight)
