[Killah Priest]
A Heavy Mentalist and his penmanship took him to unlimited
Greatness some say
It was his spaceship others say
He was gracious in the way he spit
Brought God to an atheist
Bought wisdom to a pagan since 'Basic Instructions Before Leaving Evil'
Was formed from the Black Hebrews
But he trapped with his people selling crack living illegal
Strapped with desert eagles and would clap at judges, police too
Two sides to him, he would go to combat and was peaceful
This is more of his stained-glass writing on the Church window pane as a Viking
His name is Priest

(Outro)
The Michelvangelo stick
