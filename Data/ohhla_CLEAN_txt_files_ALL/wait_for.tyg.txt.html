Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah
Wait for a minute
Can wait for a minute?
Yeah, wait for a minute
Wait for a minute
Girl, just a minute

Well, if you walk with me
Well, if you take my hand babe
We can go to a place you ain't never seen before

Slow dance in the moonlight
I'm just tryna set the mood right
I'm just doing what a dude do
Do it over and over and over

Quickly wanna run with me now
Swiftly just come with me now
Foot steps go to the beat now
Over and over and over

It's just the way, that way, that way, that you do me babe
All, I can say, that say, that say, that I'd behave
But I'd be lying babe

Just wanna wait for a minute (wait for a minute)
Wait for a minute, babe (wait for a minute)
Just wanna wait for a minute (play for a minute)
I dream place for a minute, place for a minute babe

[Tyga]
Hold up, I don't need no love
I said that with a straight face, baby that's poker
Feel a lil sober, got it mixed in my soda
I clean up good, aropa, dopa
Baby I'm the shit but that's a good odor
I'm a young star but my money look Yoda
Crib on the ocean, backyard boat shit
You hating on the Internet, I couldn't even notice
Tickets no service, we at the top working
Pop-pops is lurking, told her "don't get nervous"
I don't swerve Suburbans, this a gold derby
Ferarri's and horses, I snap like Torres
No rug, I floor it, girl, come feel important
I'm all about a dollar, babe, banks call me Georgi
9-5 Rollie, 96 Kobe, tonight we gon' ball like Ginobili
You know me, I'm just tryna...

Slow dance in the moonlight
I'm just tryna set the mood right
I'm just doing what a dude do
Do it over and over and over

Quickly wanna run with me now
Swiftly just come with me now
Foot steps go to the beat now
Over and over and over

It's just the way, that way, that way, that you do me babe (oh)
All I can say, that say, that say that I'd behave
But I'd be lying babe (I'd be lying babe)

Just wanna wait for a minute (wait for a minute)
Wait for a minute, babe (wait for a minute)
Just wanna wait for a minute (wait for a minute)
I dream place for a minute, place for a minute babe

Just wanna wait for a minute
Wait for a minute
Just to wait for a minute
Wait for a minute
Girl, just a minute
Wait just a minute
Can you wait just a minute?
Girl, just a minute
Wait just a minute, wait just a minute

Aggh!
Yeah, T-raw, JB
Too fly never stop, know what?</pre>
