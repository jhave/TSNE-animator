Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
Mmmm-mmm-mmmmmmm

My... love's old fashioned
But it still works, just the way it is
This... love is classic
And not just, simple because, I say it isssssss

[Chorus One]
It's right on time (right on time)
And it's timeless (timeless)
And it'll be right here
For al-wayyyyyyyyyys

[Cee-Lo Green]
My... love's old fashioned
So be it, I'm set in my ways
Hush child! And just listen, mmm
Don't it sound just like, the good old days? Well

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two]
My love's right on time (right on time)
And it's timeless (timeless)
And I'll be right here
For al-wayyyyyyyyyys

Ohhhhh, people they gather 'round
And they wonder how... mmmm

Right here and now?

Cause true love doesn't go out of style

Ohhh timeless!
And I'll be here
For al-wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyys</pre>
