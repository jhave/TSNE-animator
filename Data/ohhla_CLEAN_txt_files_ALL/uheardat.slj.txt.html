[Intro - 2x]
Murder murder, murder murder 
Mo' murder murder
Murder murder, murder murder
Mo' murder murder
I'ma pop him, I'ma pop him uh-huh
I'ma pop him, I'ma pop him
 
[Hook - 2x]
You heard that...uh yeah
Fuck I look like wearing a toe tag, up in a body bag
My gun my bullets, my thirty round clip
I'm never leaving home without it, I don't slip
 
[Soulja Slim]
Ok I'm some'ing serious, I'm so serious from you not knowing
I'll cut your throat till the meat showing, motherfuck a rap
I hustle rap, like four or five birds of smack
Bag up in ounces half ounces, quarters and shit like that
You get the drift, I'm grown up you can take a sniff
Don't get in your whip, I'll make you hurl up in your shit
I was that flooded bag, that that lil' boy had
Went out like a soldier, O.D.'d with his soldier rag
You better believe, uptown niggaz sold him that
I'm some'ing serious I told him that, when I first started
Now you dearly departed, still I remain raw
In reality, I chop bags up with my chainsaw
I'm rapping for a reason, God gave me this gift
And made to where a nigga can't fuck with me, running real shit
One shot for fifty cents, she brought it back to the street
Now it's all on me, to get me right now in this industry
I ain't no friend of P, don't ask me bout that boy
He ain't no man, you think I'm lying then ask Pastor Troy
I pass the toy, and let my lil' dogs get the murder charge
They feel like he played me, so they gon' bring the fucking noise
I rap bout fifty bars, motherfuck a chorus
I can do this, I'm one of the world official flowists
Magnolia Projects, is the spot where I was praised at
Got love for Mac-90's, 223's and K's and
Automatic handguns, reveolvers I had some
Booted my last one, I bagged em and toe tagged em
It's a reunion, all my real niggaz home from the penn
If I start naming these killers, they'll get up under your skin
Give em the game, tell em it ain't like back in the days
If you ain't pushing Escalades, out chea' trying to get paid
We'll be ya beat, I remember when we was on that skeet
Now it's years later like a mo'fucker, 2003
 
(*talking*)
Yeah, KLC I been fucking with ya for a long time nigga
Ya understand I'm saying, a long time partna
I came in the game fucking with ya, ya dig (fa sho nigga)
But I wanna know what the fuck you using for the high heads (this 22 gun shots)
What you using for the snout, (nine milli buck shots)
Well what's with the kick, (twelve gauge)
What that is for the open high heads, (45 cocked)
And the bass, (twelve gauge one) yeah
