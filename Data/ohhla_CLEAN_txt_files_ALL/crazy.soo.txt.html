Hell yeah, Long Beach in this motherfucker
We got the Dogg Pound in this motherfucker
Yeah that's right...
I wanna give a shout out to L.A.
Compton, Inglewood, Watts, Pasadena
San Diego, all the way up to The Bay
You know what I'm sayin'?
While the rest of y'all take a trip with me
To the West Coast (West Coast!)

Welcome to the land of the killas, gangstas, hustlers, playas
West Coast, real life "San Andreas"
The real niggaz, jack suckas, fuck the haters
We got bitches, chronic, Lakers, Raiders
Ain't much to discuss, you ain't dealin'
with just some paper champs, you fuckin' with the greatest
Eastside, throwin' up Long Beach
I keep suckas at (gunpoint reach), niggaz can't fade us
Lay 'em down (lay 'em down) That's why you scary ass
square pants niggaz ain't never came around
I bang with the Pound, I serve 'em daily
Hurt 'em baby, why you wanna hang with some clowns?
That run when the rounds spit (can't spit rounds back)
Duckin' from that fo-five nigga with that all black
Killa, floss if you want but use caution
Watch it, hold your pockets, 'cause the whole West Coast goin' crazy

[*TV reporter*]
Thank you Jim, we're here live at LAX
Scene of what appears to be yet another
gang related, double homicide
The victim, not yet indentified
was apparently walking his daughter home from school
when gunned down by what witnesses say, rival gang members
("What you gon' play now?")
("Things just ain't the same for gangstas")
("You mean it's really happening?")

You better watch your front, back, side and your grill
Your ride and your riches, your platinum, your ice
Punk it ain't nothin' nice to get caught slippin'
Pops must have taught you different
He said boy you better think twice fuckin' with that street life
Huh, you better learn to work your feet nice
Heat nice, half down, double-up street price
Make it work, don't make it a burden
Snatch it up, lights out, it's curtains
For them niggaz that' can't handle this (West Coast) get dismantled
Most of these niggaz crunk, the rest don't give a fuck
Just gangbangin', number one way of the West
One chance, better make it your best
Better protect your chest, if you alive you blessed
Stayin' down, I'm survivin' the test
Cause I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta nigga
Don't get too anxious nigga
Wanna trip, bucket slip then you out Swayze, shit is crazy...

The West Coast goin' crazy...
The West Coast goin' crazy...
The West Coast goin' crazy...
The West Coast goin' crazy...
The West Coast goin' crazy...
The West Coast goin' crazy...</pre>
