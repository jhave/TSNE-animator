Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I used to say today sucks I hope it gets better
Now, I think life is like the dopest shit ever
My girl's off work, got her out of her sweater
And then we took a hot shower together
Steamy!

[Verse #1]
Yo, uh
See I've been thinking
A little too much from all the coffee I've been drinking
But really I've been thinking
It seems that the list of my admirers is shrinking
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna spend half my life sleeping, forever
People only discuss the weather when they're bored of small talk
And can't spit something better
I measure my friendships and leave if the drama never stops
Or the need for the pressure is endless
My sleeves are rolled up
I don't wanna rap this part
Speed up for the cake like a fat kid's heart
Speed up, hit the brakes, leave a black skid mark
Motherfucker this is passionate art
And I'm still getting bread though I get bread and crumbs
Gonna have Alexis Coop before it's all said and done
I don't love these hoes
I just love a girl that wants me to be comfortable
I'm so lovable

[Chorus]
I'll be your knight in shining armor in your armor in the shining night
I'm making use of my entire life
The only thing I ever wanted to be is the best damn version of
Me that I could be, now I
Wooooo!!!
I'm gonna win at life baby, I'm gonna win at life baby, I'm in the lead
Wooooo!!!
I'm gonna win at life baby, I'm gonna win at life baby, I'm in the lead

[Verse #2]
I'm feeling like a bob white
Singing the name of my species
Human, angel, halo, king me
Knee deep in idioms
On a 1920s old indian
I'm the pimp of the millenium
Yeah bitch, we about to go ham sandwich
You see I get money
But then I reinvest money
All the people that blow money, you're just dumbies
Here's some free advice
Every 10 dollars that you get
Take 7 dollars of that shit and put it away
Right up in the bank, don't you touch it
Now you never gotta worry about being over budget
You spending all your money on alchol and coke
And got the nerve to wonder why you're broke
Man stop, man quit
A DUI is 2000 dollars you don't even wanna chance it

[Chorus]

[Verse #3]
I used to say today sucks I hope it gets better
Now, I think life is like the dopest shit ever
My girl's off work, I got her out of her sweater
And took a hot steamy shower together, my god
I could swallow a rubix cube and shit it out solved
But I could never live without y'all
The black clover Mac Lethal fans
Uh, white people move awkwardly to my music and black people dance
Either way it's all good, all great, all fun
Just don't marry the wrong one
You see my dad used to tell me
The best divorce happens before the marriage even takes place
So get healthy and log off of match dot com
Go outside and say hello to the first pretty ass hot mom that you see
Get a date for tonight, and if she's good shit make her your wife
It's Uncle Mac baby!

[Chorus]</pre>
