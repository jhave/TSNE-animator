[Intro: T-Pain] + (Fabolous) + {J.D.}
I try to play cool
Actin like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin at home, all alone
Tryin to keep myself from goin crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about {T-Pain}
I want my baby back! {'Lo-so} And I thought it would be easy
but it's hard for me to let you GO~!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't) {y'all know what this is}

[Fabolous]
Now I'm better than your ex, gon' be better than your next
Baby Screwed Up so you better be from Tex-as
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out
Nothin to scream about just back your Beemer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to Kima house
Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?
Better do you cause I damn sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me
The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me
I don't wanna another you so I'ma slide (yup)
But I got another boo, on the side, bay-bay

[Chorus: T-Pain] + (Fabolous) + {unlisted J.D. ad libs}
I try to play cool
Actin like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin at home, all alone
Tryin to keep myself from goin crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about
I want my baby back! And I thought it would be easy
but it's hard for me to let you GO~!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't)

[Fabolous]
Through the time I been alone, time I spent on phones
Know you ain't lettin them climb up in my throne
Now, baby that lime with that Patron
Have me talkin crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above
It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick wit'cha entree and get over your side
We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love'll have you open though
I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show
So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The neck scratches show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'ma do somethin, it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us
Mr. and Ms. Smith, we both got the burners - UP~!
If you love your baby then turn this up
Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup
Relax, don't be tryin to perm us up
We already straight - yesss

[Chorus]

[Jermaine Dupri]
Fab we gon' have to make a dance to this song man!
Y'knahmean; ain't no WAY you can't dance on this
Uhhh, T-Pain!

[T-Pain]
I want my baby back! And I thought it would be easy
but it's hard for me to let you GO~!</pre>
