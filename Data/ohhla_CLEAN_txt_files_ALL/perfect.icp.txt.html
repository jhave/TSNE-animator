Song:   The Perfect Night
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Violent J]
On the perfect night the graveyard is lit by a full moon
Autumn leaves and stone often treated with an old boom
Here and there the night air carries bass drops
The soundtrack is something fast running through the crops

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
On the perfect night fallin' stars don't even get noticed
People throwin' holy water on they doors is scared of ghosts
On the perfect night the wind is blowin' hard enough to sway the trees
And it's about a hundred degrees

[Violent J]
On the perfect night the whole town shuts of its lights
And listens to the city; screams, sirens, howls, and fights
On the perfect night everything blends in with the shadows
Moon in the sky; rats, owls, bats, ravens, and crows
On the perfect night

[Chorus]
Iii...(Be sure to lock up and board all your windows
And doors and don't leave your home. Don't. Don't)
Love a perfect Night (Don't leave your home. Don't)
Perfect night (Don't Leave your home)

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
On the perfect night bitches get they panties pulled off and love it
The fuckin' moon is so low you can almost touch it
Bats rule the dark skies snatchin' mosquitoes
Possums diggin' through your garbage cans for leftover Fritos

[Violent J]
On the perfect night there's twenty-seven clowns in a minivan
And every one of us understands how we could kill a man
On the perfect night it's windy enough to surf clouds
Like the hawks and vultures on they pilgrimage south

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Street lights that haven't worked for years suddenly glow
Missin' children from a hundred years ago now they show
On the perfect night no reception, something's in the air
Maybe you can see it or ya can't but it's clearly there
On the perfect night

[Chorus]

[Violent J]
Fortune tellers and psychics have nosebleeds all night
'cause they're flooded with the energies attacken' 'em bright
A headless man on a ten speed in the middle of the road
He's swervin' a little but still peddlin' home

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
On the perfect night dead people get to sleep in
'cause when they wake up on a night like this its where to begin
The ringmaster's wagons can travel far and undisturbed
'Cept they show up in the dark for the town they about to serve

[Violent J]
The dark is perfectly upon us like a million piranhas
Swallow you whole like little dicks in big vaginas
On the perfect night you can bet that nobody's sleepin'
The darkness outside is thick and heavy got your walls creakin'

[Chorus x3]</pre>
