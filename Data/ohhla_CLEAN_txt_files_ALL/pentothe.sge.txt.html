[Sage Francis]
Condoliza Rice I don't need your lies your jittery when under attack
It's funny at least for you to lie through your teeth cause there's a credibility gap
Got big Saddam but we missed Bin Laden and Bush still ain't found no weapons
Headline "WE GOT 'EM" is still a big problem in Iraq there killing Americans
I thought the war was over we're sending more soldiers something just wasn't done right
Tell bush he could of, should of, would of, maybe next time bring a pen to the gun fight
MOTHERFUCKER

[Nirvana Sample]
Nothing on top but a bucket and a mop and an illustrated book about birds
There's a lot up there but don't be scare, who needs actions when you got words..
