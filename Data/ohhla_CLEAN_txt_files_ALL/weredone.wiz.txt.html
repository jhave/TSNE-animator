Song:   We're Done
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
We're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, out to the end of the day
It keeps getting better
Don't be afraid, we'll do it together

Started from nothing, ended up with everything
From the house, to the whips, taking trips to any place that you care to name
Champagne, skydivin'
EZ wider papers, no blunts, hit it once you mile high
Runnin' now I'm livin' how I'm supposed to
Laughing at you haters like I told you
I just tell the waitress keep pouring
Get infront of the camera keep posing
Too much bank to be rolled in, that's why I stay golden, till the cake gets swollen
And you just can't fold it. or it's old and molded
And the crust get golden

[Chorus x2]

You stay the night cause you say my life is exciting
Wake up still drunk not going to work cause you like it
Livin' with no regrets
Buyin' more bottles while we got ones I ain't even opened yet
Notice that first thought you wanna talk about your boyfriend
Now everytime he callin' you ignoring them
Somewhere tasting trees
Cat and mouse
You chase me I'll chase this cheese
While we're young, one

[Chorus x2]</pre>
