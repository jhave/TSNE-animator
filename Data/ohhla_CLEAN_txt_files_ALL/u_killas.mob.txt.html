[Intro: Raekwon]
Let's get a little, little, little, little drawing going on
Yeah, that's what it is man
Word up, A$AP Rocky, what up my nigga
Young king right there
Yeah, I see you, nigga
It's your big brother Chef right here, man
Raekwon, nigga
You know we got you all day, nigga
I know you got your big brother all day, too
Ya know, it's all real

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
At the dice game, on sleeze mode
Gun in the road, but count hunneds
Sit back my home on my stomach
Who the king boo, eating grapes
Send me to 50 states
I pump everywhere I go I thump
Plenty spaces, either I'm in the slums
Counting up ones, shaking down fiends
Hopping to the most and one
Besides bagging up, new ratchets
Always in hatchets nigga
The fly bachelor with all those classics
My gun is red eyeball brown
Run the town black hoodie sweats
No jewels a coupe with some specs
Matching in the million dollar mansion
With brans and it's always love love
Just bring your advancing
Bottles from everywhere, hoes run up
Niggaz in tennis wear I'm finish the menace
Get them yeah
Yo, we in the cut... dogs on them
Stay cocky, peace is real
Yo, rocky!

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg &amp; A$AP Rocky]
King of New York with these underground killas
Ride, ride, nigga fuck the niggaz, nigga
King of New York with these underground killas
Ride, ride, nigga fuck the niggaz, nigga
King of New York with these underground killas
Ride, ride, nigga fuck the niggaz, nigga
King of New York with these underground killas
Ride, ride, nigga fuck the niggaz, nigga

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
My uncle Snoop told me keep the biscuit on me
Said they got the scoop on me and they listen on me
Plus my bujy ass neighbors keep the bitchin on me
And the nosy bitch next door call the district on me
And they snitching on me, self esteem went missing on me
Chip off my shoulder, you can get it off me
But these bitches on me
The other fucker got a prison story
That mister reese just a missing story
Listen wardy, I was on them bitches
Pitching sipping, 40's, mory, kitchen...
Shawties kissing shawties
Keep division Brody, cold world, keep your mittens wordy
Go hard but you kill them softly
Pay attention Shawty
Wonder why I call you bitch a Shawty
The weight of the world gonna be tripping Shawty
Just get your picking Shawty
Hold your own, keep it pimping brody
Same shit, just a different story

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
King of New York in my hood we blow up houses
Grenades look like water water sitting on the counter
Silence all you will encounter
If you talking bout you badder
Tucking noise heating salad
Gripping up banger in...
Like pacs from the waynes
When I fire, switching lanes in the Porsche
Gotta catch up to my tires
Got cannons like Mariah, got... my Messiah
Put them to rest in his pajamas
Twin clips, push a t, that's for talking all that...
In your bitch, I'm a sneaker, she gonn need some new balance
Got franklins like Areta, see my money that be pilin'
And my money got teeth, you can see my money smiling

[Chorus]</pre>
