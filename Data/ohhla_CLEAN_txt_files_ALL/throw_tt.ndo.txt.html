(Hook, Indo G)
From Memphis Ten. to Chattanooga, yeah throw them thangs!
From La Fayette to New Orleans, just throw them thangs!
From Minnesota to Dakota, just throw them thangs
From Decatur to Atlanta, just throw them thangs!
From Chicago to Detroit, yeah throw them thangs!
From New York to California, just throw them thangs!
From Miami to Orlando, just throw them thangs
From Dallas Texas or to Houston, just throw them thangs!

(Verse 1, Lord Infamous)
Ain't no pities for the niggas of the cities, damn ya sign
You got a grind on your mind, I know you sick and tired
You better get up off yo knees, we don't cry nor die
And this time, we gonna go out on a while, with the boldest style
Rockin with the Scarecrow on this chariot of fire
And this time we shall prevail and build our own empire, and you shall learn
There will be no return, we'll watch the cities burn
Understand me, don't come at me, Lord the jammie
Take their mammies and their families and their families; slam
I'm the rudest tootist shoolist boolist "Silence of the Lamb"
Blaaay! Lord from Three 6 land, on a hostile take
Death to the damn fools, who refuse to cooperate
Rollin with this new clique, manage, then I fumble
Let me make this humble, welcome to the jungle!
-Blow!- this world to Kindom Come
I'm the leader of this one, scorpion of Armageddon

(Hook, Indo G)
From Mississippi to Ohio, yeah throw them thangs!
From Alabama to Montana, just throw them thangs!
From Oklahoma to Palomino, just throw them thangs
From clear up here to Nashville, just throw them thangs!
From Inglewood to the Bay, yeah throw them thangs!
From Miami to Orlando, just throw thangs!
From Memphis Ten. to Chattanooga, just throw them thangs
Why you lookin at me crazy, boy? Just throw them thangs!

(Verse 2, Indo G)
When a motherfucka mild wild n throw them thangs
See we maintain, gang bang, slang yo 'cain mayn
Just bring the pain
I'm out here workin these streets
Smokin my weed cause I'm beat
These player haters know better 
I'm bout my cheddar, you wetter
Drop it off yo ass, it's on now nigga
Put him in the trigger, you wanna be bigger, you figure
You wanna break me down, mossburg runnin around
Layin it down bitch, underground
Bounce with the bass foo, just bounce bounce
Everybody throw them thangs foo, it's on now
I stays up on my tippy toes, look out for foes
This nigga po', strike a pose at that red light
And throw them thangs at them po-po's
Land of the lost; Memphis Tenne-sin
We killas with that "Gorilla Pimpin"
Ain't no half-steppin, these niggas crazy
Gone, I'm in that zone, we breakin bread, welfare
A hundred grand, heard what I said?
See you can hate us or you can join
It's whatever mayn
Nigga, come and get'chu stomped bitch
We throw them thangs!

(Hook, Indo G)
Now Prophet Posse to them thugs, yeah throw them thangs!
From Head Flo Enteratainment boy, just throw them thangs!
From Triple 6 Mafia, just throw them thangs
From down south L.A. boy, just throw them thangs!
From East coast to West coast, yeah throw them thangs!
From up North to down South, just throw them thangs!
Why you lookin at me crazy mayn? Just throw them thangs!
From Memphis Ten. to Chattanooga boy, just throw them thangs!

(Verse 3, Gangsta Boo)
Blazin on some hella weed
Finest lady, yes indeed
With some down ass niggas entouraging in the street
If you wanna fuck with me, come and get me and you'll see
See yourself in a place that you do not wanna be
Oh my God, I'm feelin strange
Strange enough to throw them thangs
You can say that Gangsta Boo is sort of mentally deranged
Triple 6 got me like this, rasin me into the clique
Might as well say that I am a main ass bitch
First page on a magazine, mean muggin cause I'm crunk
Takin hoods by storm, down South gettin buck
What the fuck you gonna do?
Cause the homegirl Gangsta Boo
Gettin money by the lumps, ohh bitch I pity you
Ninety-eight come in on time
Knockin bitches out the line
Want the whole motherfuckin industry all mine
Aye yo kid what's goin on, lookin crazy in yo zone
Lord Infamous is gone, throwin thangs at some domes

(Hook, Indo G)
From Memphis Ten. to Chattanooga, yeah throw them thangs!
From La Fayette to New Orleans, just throw them thangs!
From Minnesota to Dakota, just throw them thangs
From Decatur to Atlanta, just throw them thangs!
From Chicago to Detroit, yeah throw them thangs!
From New York to California, just throw them thangs!
From Miami to Orlando, just throw them thangs
To my nigga BUCK BITCH, just throw them thangs!

(Outro)
