[Verse 1: KAM]
Yo, yo, yo
And these nerds got problems with my words cause they bluntly sate
And these crackers in the government that want me dead
Crooked Feds, sheriff police and Highway Petrol
All know I'm anti so why I even play the role?
I know, you hate to see us ballin, but fate is callin'
And Babylon the great is fallin'
My back against the wall, but see my faith ain't shaky
No matter what they do to try to put me to rot, they can't break me
I flash all the lane like the strap flame
And be smashin, ever since I came in the Rap Game
No suck dick in their crave fame
But I ain't gave up shit but my slave name
Unload through a fact, these crackers can't equal the brother character
I represent the poor black people of America
From the soldiers that's yell shot "TO WHOM?"
To the homies who be goin' through hell on the cell block
Representin' the street thuggin, tryin' to bubble 
To the single mothers tryin' to eat, strugglin' in trucks
Those that's weak and those that ain't
I feel the brother got to speak for those that can't
Deep in the bay, our coast, eastside, west coast
In the California rulers where they're doin' the most
Instead of livin' a skit, it's easy beggin' we quit
But nigga I don't give a fuck what they threat me wit

[Chorus: KAM]
These motherfuckers can't break me
Man, these suckers can't break me
These perpetrators can't break me
Man, these haters can't break me
These interrupters can't break me
Their penitentiaries can't break me
These treacherin' girls can't break me
Man, this wicked world can't break me

[Verse 2: KAM]
Ten precent blood, suckers start to lay me down
All they did was fuckin' around, and get in mainly clown
With the sound of the lost, found the tribe of Shabazz
I expose these whores like the wizard of vibes
Lord knows man, these crackers ain't make me known
So I'ma bang this black thing 'til it take me home
Hear the cry of the small fry when we pray
I'll be the fall guy, fuck it, we all gonna die anyway "That's right"
They might scratch your body but they can't break your mind
Fuck wealth find, I do it for myself and kind
I'm makin' a few dollars but I make a gang of cents
Know what to bang for and who to bang against
Diggin' past, present and future in perfect tense
Stand strong in back whenever straddle the fence
So this enemy can't prevail
Cause I don't buy their shit and I ain't for sale

[Chorus: KAM]

[Verse 3: KAM]
These niggaz wanna shut me up, break me down
Stir me away, turn me around, storm me out
Stop my fight, bite me off, stop my life, make my fate
Make me die, Kill my spiel, hurt me out
Fray my heal, vers' my squad, make me curse God
Give up hope, retreat
I can't cope, be sweat
Sell out, switch hit, make me do some bitch shit
Quit ride on bang, go soft
Just intertain, turn Pop
Stay calm, stop droppin' Islam
Transaction in the bar go blocked and white Bobby
Prosecutin' my Tupac and Biggie small me
Call me Anti-white cause how I get at them
Sellin' crackers, but when we call each other nigga that's platinum
Man, we gain no sins, and we ain't no mucks
But make no mistake, Muhammad don't make no punks
We kill snakes and skunks, so you can call me a sinner
But dead or alive, I'ma still be the winner

[Chorus: KAM]</pre>
