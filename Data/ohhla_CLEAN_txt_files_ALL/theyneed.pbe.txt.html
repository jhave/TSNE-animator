[Intro]
Our society is fucked up, they're fucking our brothers and sisters up
These white motherfuckers have fucked us up...
This ain't by no goddamn accident...

Cameras, action, lights
What, lookout, civil rights
Whiplash, po-po, fed-lillers, killin' kids
Crisis, c'mon, get it now, sound
COINTEL, going down
Projects, pop offs, issues, payback
Sickness, lockdown, get it
Free Mumia and H. Rap Brown

Before you get what you want, gotta give the people what they need

What you know about Soul
If you got's none then we'll loan ya some...

C'mon!

Flow on, the project, the pop off
Low tempo to go off, COINTEL better go to hell
Bout that time hear the bell y'all .. (c'mon)
Gotta lotta nerve never knowing Assata
Gotcha mind wading in the water.. contract.. Gotcha!
Motown, Stax, bring the beat back
(Bring that beat back!)
The Sound, free Mumia and H. Rap Brown
Sure enough going down now
Jamil Al Amin, nahmean? (yeah)
Y'all missin' this is like dissin' this
See your Uncle Sam pissing on this
He's running real low on my shit list
Take 'em all out with the quickness

Before you get what you want, gotta give the people what they need
Before you get what you want, gotta give the people what they need

Cameras, action, lights
What, lookout, civil rights
Whiplash, po-po, fed-lillers, killin' kids
Crisis, c'mon, get it now, sound
COINTEL, going down
Lookout!

Before you get what you want.. gotta give the people what they need
Before you get what you want.. gotta give the people what they need
Before you get what you want.. gotta give the people what they need
Before you get what you want.. gotta give the people what they need

New breed of MC and get the flow on
Body, mind, soul enough to go on
Ughh!! Better go on
Gotta get on so I can spit on
Guitar to get on the pick on (damn)
Shuffle now, the popcorn
Free H. Rap c'mon
Nothing new uhh.. better walk on
Ughhh... get my talk on
Never knew a {?} to get your money on
So on and so on
Do it like Mike - "Sha-mon!"
The original right here, Uptown Saturday Night
Uggghhh, get it, and get your head right...
Ya'll don't know nothin' about this ... ughhh
Real thing ughhh make your soul ring

Before you get what you want.. gotta give the people what they need
Before you get what you want.. gotta give the people what they need

Cameras, action, lights
What, lookout, civil rights
Whiplash, po-po, fed-lillers, killin' kids
Crisis, c'mon, get it now, sound
COINTEL, going down

Going down, going down, going down, going down
Going down, going down, going down, going down
Going down, going down, going down, going down
Going down, down, down, down</pre>
