[Andre 3000]
Walk it out like a usher
If you say real talk, I probably won't trust ya
If you want to go to war, the gun's my pleasure
Even Jesus had 12 disciples on the level, trigger, whatever
Peyimmmmp, you don't want nan day of three thou'
I'm like jury duty - you're new to this part of town
Your white tee, well to me, look like a nightgown
Make your momma proud, take that thing two sizes down
Then you'll, look like the man that you are, or what you could be
I can I give a damn 'bout your car, but then I would be
if it was considered a classic befo' the drastic change
in production when cars were metal instead of plastic
Value - is what I'm talkin 'bout, take two of these and walk it out
You'll be the reason they chalk it out, you can't be the king in the parkin lot
Forever - not sayin I'm the best but 'til they find somethin better
I am here, no fear, write me a letter, 'til then
I walk it out, I walk it out, I walk it out, I walk it out
I walk it out, I walk it out, I walk it out
I Westside walk it ow-out, I Westside walk it ow-out
I Westside walk it ow-out, then Eastside walk it ow-out

[Unk]
I walked it out the bank, with a lot of zeros
That's what my teachers called me, predictions like they Cleo
So I do my dance for 'em, then make my forty thousand
I do that in a month, I'm on resorts and islands
I make them walk it out, yeahhhh, it's me again
But I'm with Jones, Daddy Fatsacks and Benjamin
I roll with made men, that brake the stage in
And keep the girls happy, so y'all can get the nappy
Gangsters they do they dance, they do it to my song
See I was up in Cali, Crip-walkin it all night long
Drop twenty on my neck, got ten on they wrist
A billion doller look, a million doller kiss
I'm nationwide homey, you still at home homey
With no promotions on me, man that's balogna homey
The album off in sto's, I'm "Beat'n Down Yo Block"
Now 'gwan and walk it out, they still on my jock

[Chorus]

[Jim Jones - over Chorus]
Jones, DipSet, uhh
Jones (yup) it's DipSet Byrd Gang
Now come holla at me
You know how we get it out here

[Jim Jones]
Eastside walk it out (walk it out) Bronx walk it out (walk it out)
Queens walk it out (walk it out) you know Brooklyn walk it out (walk it out)
Now Harlem walk it out (walk it out) Harlem walk it out (walk it out)
Harlem walk it out (walk it out) Harlem walk shit out - BALLIN~!
Now we don't walk it out, we drop-top Porsche it out
I hopped out floss it out, I bring my Air Forces out (clean)
I'm blowin purple smoke, I cough it out, ball it up then ball it out
Tap the bottle, pour it out - BALLIN~!
Now do the fade-away, and throw some paper-way
And we can skate away, tell the office I'll be late today
Hoe I can thug it out, or starstud it out (fo' sho')
I take a trip with my bitch and Louis luggage out
I'm talkin Magic City, or even Body Tap
You know that money ain't a thing we throwin thousand stacks
Hoe yeah we toss it out, you know I'm talkin 'bout (fo' sho')
When capo status in the house you know New York is out

[Chorus]

[Big Boi]
I walk it out like that last shot of 'gnac at the club
Cause the package sto' was closed and I'm attached to my buzz
Been slammin Cadillac do's, you know what it was cuz
Stay jammin everything platinum check the status cuz cuz
Boy I side! Brimmin with diamonds but that don't mean shit
Designin fly rhyme patterns since I was seventeen kid
On "Southernplayalistic" intro listen close to Peaches
She said nothin but king shit all day, and they be bi-tches
It's like I'm at the dentist cause everybody got crowns
I'll change to ace of spades, cutthroats, and won't bow down
Not a king queen or jack fade this, come clean son
Swing from my 'sac like my babies
Actin like you crazy, Daddy Fat' don't like that misbehavin
A-Town's up and deuces down, and somethin else that be created
Tell Oomp, get the doomp, clear the booth it's now official
Droppin bombs like a North Korean nuclear missile
I'll walk it out, yeah

[Chorus]

[Unk]
Okay now do it how you do it, 'gwan and walk it out
I said do it how you do it, 'gwan and walk it out
Okay, do it how you do it, 'gwan and walk it out
I said do it how you do it, 'gwan and walk it out
Walk, walk, walk, now walk it out
Walk, walk, walk, now walk it out
Walk, walk, walk, now walk it out
I said do it how you do it, 'gwan and walk it out
Ayyyyyyyyyyyy~!</pre>
