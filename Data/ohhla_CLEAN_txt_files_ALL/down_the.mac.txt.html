Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hey!
And it's the best day ever..
So pack your motherfuckin' bags, cause we gonna go
So pack your motherfuckin' bags, cause we gonna go

Hey, I got a..
Cup of Henny
Joint of good
Not gettin' any sleep, even though I should
Catch a early flight
Hit another city
For a concert full the fans who be fucking with me
Countin' hundreds, fifties
Groupy hoes
That all love to show me how they drop they booty low
Two in ones
That's a Manaja twa
Watch they bras come off, have me saying LA-DE-DA
Rock and Roll
Living life
Gettin' head
Get it twice
It feels like I've been drunk for the 11th night
Don't know how I'm gonna wake in time to catch this flight
All these bitches in the front row try to dress alike
They do a lot of barking, but they never bite
They lookin' at me like I'm gonna have some sex tonight
And yes I might if it's alright

Cause I got what you need if you lookin' for a trip
Escape the world a lil bit, maybe go and get a grip
This all can be a drug, just please don't take too much
you can have it free of charge, though I do it for the love [x2]

Cause first I
Take a breathe
Then let it out
Hear them clap a little while, then I take my bow
I'm on my job
But maybe out my mind
Got some liquor and some weed, it's about that time
Anyway you name it, I'm entertainment, I make it, I'll admit I'm kind of famous
My life is like a vacation, cause day out and day in these hotels, day inns
Travel navigation, I switch up my location
They going without shavin', the road life's a bitch
But fuck it, this the good life, so for no life, I switch
Got my money coming faster than these women I get into
Can't tell me how to live my life, chill fool, I've been cool
I'm type of dude
Pretty cool, kind of nice, not rude
Cause some hoes who like my tunes
Get front row and show their boobs
Party every night, they worry that I'll blow the fuse
But I'm way too young and don't know rules

Okay (Cause), I got what you need if you lookin' for a trip
Escape the world a lil bit, maybe go and get a grip
This all can be a drug, just please don't take too much
you can have it free of charge, though I do it for the love [x2]</pre>
