Yeah, whassup? 
RIP, shout-out to my dead partners 

(Spice 1) 
My nigga went crazy he's trapped in a cell 
He chopped off his fingers and sent them back in the mail 
If life is a bitch, I'll pimp it just like a hoe 
I make all my money from slangin ounces of coke 
I shot up a bitch cuz she was fiend 
She's spreadin information tryin to run off with my ring 
I'm livin' in fear, motherfuckers wanna jack when 
A 187 nigga's best friend is a Mack 10 
Niggas be rollin up on me and loadin the clip and say I'm slippin 
but I'm in a fucked up state of mind 
and I'm packin a nine and I'm not trippin 
Cause I'm strapped thinkin about my nigga took out in the game 
R-I-P, plan B Jessie was his name 
So rest in peace, peace my nigga R-I-P 

(Chorus: Spice 1) 
R-I-P, R-I-P, rest in peace to dead niggas on the wall 
R-I-P, rest in peace to dead niggas on the wall 
R-I-P, rest in peace to dead niggas on the wall 
Yeah whassup Clean? 
I ain't forgot about you homie 
Johnny B whassup Clay? 
I ain't forgot about you either 
Hope y'all tear this thang knahI'msayin? 
Big Dave, Jr, Six-O-Mobb, yeah 

(Spice 1) 
When I was young I had the lust to pull the trigger 
So I know how it feels to shoot another nigga 
Take one of mine I'll take ten of yours 
You call up your posse I'll call up my boys 
The funk, it was jumpin', but why should it jump? 
Niggas with Uzi's and hella niggas with pumps 
Ready to spray do a nigga up proper 
Did my boy in good chopped him up with the chopper 
See some more from the north Johnny B from the crew 
seen a nigga get blasted his bloody foot in his shoe 
The bag the body the body the bag 
From forties to funerals from chronic to zag's 
I'm rollin up one for niggas that died 
I go out to forty and hit the strip in my ride 
And let down the top cause my top drop 
Handle my glock incase I gotta pop 

(Chorus: Spice 1) 
R-I-P, rest in peace to dead niggas on the wall 
R-I-P, rest in peace to dead niggas on the wall 
R-I-P, rest in peace to dead niggas on the wall 
Yeah fool whatta you know about my partners Mark Crowser 
Y'all know nothin about Erick Ason 
Y'all know nothin about Big Round Sink knahI'msayin? 
O.G.'s they got much love, Marcus Raine

My nigga had bomb we called him Big Dave 
Six slugs in the chest put my boy in the grave 
I went to his house to get me a sack 
His brother stood on the porch and told me the facts 
Strange how it happened he went out for a night 
Strange car drove up that's when the pistols went pop 
Should I pull on the trigger and we bell on these niggas? 
Should I roll up the Endo hit throw up drunk offa liquor? 
My memorials of my dead niggas on the wall 
And when I die I know I'm dyin with a bullet y'all 
But the nigga that take me out, he better have the clout 
Because my niggas gonna chop your bloody body route 
You know this nigga ain't afraid to die 
Just write my name on the wall: Gangsta S-P-I
C-E R-I-P - rest in peace nigga 

(Chorus: Spice 1) 
R-I-P, rest in peace to dead niggas on the wall 
R-I-P, rest in peace to dead niggas on the wall 
R-I-P, rest in peace to dead niggas on the wall 
R-I-P, rest in peace to dead niggas on the wall</pre>
