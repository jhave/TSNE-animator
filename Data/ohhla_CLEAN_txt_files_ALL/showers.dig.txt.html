Squeeze, release, in and out, hold, let go, rise, come down

Let the wet sensuality embrace your reality 
Moonstones drip slip bout it bout it see
Continuously we be gettin' freaky 
Rose petals cham-pag-nee come and see me
Positions run fluid honey ribbons create a quiver shivers  delivers
Ooh wee sweet haromony synchronicity the simplicity
Seven day kisses slide in you and me me me [Slide you and me yeah]

You messin' up my mind in the right way I'm ready to play and lay with you
Been savin' all my love for a lotta days I'm ready to spend what I saved on you
[Saved on you]

I wanna do it outside [I wanna go outside]
I wanna do it in the rain [Let's do it in the rain]

I wanna do it outside [I wanna do it outside]
I wanna do it in the rain [Baby let's get wet in the rain]

Don't know if rain drops or lust swellin' in my eyes
Want to stroke you and soak you but not just between your thighs
Your hips plus the way roll grips gets me swervin' 
Job site visit exquisite lunch time excursions
Kitty cats purrin' wet lips get near then...[Boo Yaaw]
Skin parts start disappearin'
Earlobes get chewed up Hennessy poured in two cups
Downtown is looking delicious audio schooled up
Let's heat the mood up say what's on your mind
When bones grind, lips to ??? sippin on wine 
Rhythmic tussles but not the struggle
Ever juggle raindrops strawberry snuggles?
Do what you want to 
Let's take it outdoors with out your
There's no one without beds without floors
Together explore, makin' the stormy breeze
Plays our body softly like piano keys

I wanna do it outside [I wanna go outside]
I wanna do it in the rain [Do it in the rain]

I wanna do it outside 
I wanna do it in the rain

Erotic beads of rolling water tricklin' 
And ticklin' swarms of moonlight kisses
Hips and thighs aligned in perfect nines and soft wet sixes
Wine and candy rain drop hor's devoures 
To be dined from deep within your curves
We merge devinely on liquid missions 
Climbing grinding finding climax with each position
Naked skin chills hair filled with rain 
Caressing erect body tips next to me
It's ectasy when we play 
Easing winds bring mounds of lust whisper three words we love to say
Dripping black laces, hidden places
Manicured hands around joysticks of passion
Splashing seeds of new beginning swimming on naked skin 
Or trapped within thin lambskin walls
Windchimes and bells, erotic smells
Breath becomes deep, desire swells, desire swells

You messin' up my mind in the right way I wanna play and lay with you
Been savin' all my love for right one, I wanna spend it on you

I wanna do it outside [I wanna do it  outside]
I wanna do it in the rain [Girl let me do it to you baby]

I wanna do it outside. [Let's go out and get busy in the rain] 
I wanna do it in the rain

Squeeze, release, in and out, hold, let go, rise, come down
