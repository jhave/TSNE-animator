Chorus-DJ Paul-(8x)
I'd rather die a soldier 
Than nigga live a coward

(Lord Infamous)
Bullets are spittin' alright
I will let the metal slide 
I'm layin wit' late at nite
The hindus state you will die
I know you lay petrified 
Cause Infamous set you right
Wit' shotguns and falsty knives
That blow you clear out of sight
You're wit' all your might
Your conscious is stayin' by 
You all in that sacrifice
I'm going off ignified 
The rope round yo' neck is tight 
You pop out your fuckin' knives
And that way you'll never cry,never cry

(Lachat)
Now nigga how you gonna act like 
You didn't fuck up 
So accept the fact 
How many times you've been warned
It's murder when ya fuck wit' Chat
Don't need your sorrow or your pity 
Should've thought before you did it
Ash to ash and dust to dust 
Ya'll rest in space 
You know Chat when a motherfucker run on up
Yeah youse a great bitch
Just letting you know got thoughts of red
Oh,no remorse I buck you down wit' da .44
Never see my cowards 
I got too much pride to let it ride
My nigga it's whatever 
We can buck it out til ???

Chorus-8x

(Project Pat) 
Comin' like a duck a
You know I came for trouble
Some thug wit' the crosser
Hollow let a bust a
The hood for da money
Comin' from a junkie 
Yo' nose kinda  runny 
You feel like a mummy 
Yo' car gets a crummy 
But mine's gettin' phatter
Yo' lips gettin' black a
To me it don't matter 
Ya pay whatch owe a
Pla-ya fashoa
True mentality of a ghetto soldier

(T-Rock)
Don't never get next to me 
Although platinum thuggin' is my pedigree
I calculate my weapons,to killin' is my recipe 
Bless it be my militant Memphis when in jeapordy
Testin' me I blast him in the opens like sesame
West it be a much bigger man than what they measure me
My mother and my rifle are my only 2 treacheries
Best believe a singular shot you plead heavily
Never breathe I guess a casket was his destiny

Chorus-8x

(Crunchy Black)
I got a problem
Money dividends gotta solve'em 
I heard you niggas they out to rob man
I can't let'em get me bro 
I can't let'em get me
No I gotta stand ten toes
I gotta keep a strap on me
I gotta make sure no phone dead catch me cornered
Out here on that streetlife 
I'd rather die a soldier than a coward any night 

(Gangsta Boo)
How you wanna do it 
How you wanna take it
You gon' wake up naked in the bed wit' satan 
Shakin',wakin' up and shit
Bitch I betcha when the tech be pointed at ya 
Maybe you will catch a fuckin' bullet 
Never pistol platin' never bent 
Bitch I'd rather be soldier than a coward any day 
Bitch I'd rather smoke a hydro watch my cash flow
anyway
Call me Gangsta,Gangsta never fuck me thank ya
If you ain't no man,wit' no cheese and some niggas who
knew me

(MC Mack)
Cm Mack contemplating,waiting for another bitch to
slip
I'm sippin' on the verve
That's where I stay try wit' those pistol grips
I never ever come up short 
When it's time to jack a rudypoo
Just place the thangs up to his brain
(Gunshot sounds)
Bitch,I'm MC Mack,I close yo' shop 
Trick you done found out 
I'd rather go out like soldoer 
Then even fuck off wit' you cowards 
Come up on me,run up on me
Nigga like you got some anna 
Play that role like you so buck 
And Kamikaze gonna find ya 
They better remind ya

(Scanman) 
Kamikaze start nigga 
Why nigga 
Don't play me nigga 
I don't give fuck nigga 
Test if you wanna nigga 
Slugs gonna hit ya nigga 
Leave you in a gutter nigga 
Police ain't gon' find me nigga 
Cause I'm long gone nogga

Called on by the Scanman
