[Verse 1]
Easy or hard way
Now you can choose the easy or hard way
Cole took the long way
A loser hardly I moved up to Broadway
With night time to broad day
Pregame to foreplay
Used to cruise up to Bojangles
In R Jay's lil Hyundai
Little bottle of that E&amp;J
Liquor all in my DNA
Shout out NC ANT where I found that TNA
Ain't seen me at the VMA
Nigga like me wasn't nominated
One month later fuck a hater
Nigga like me done dominated
Wanna ride to the top
Then roll with me baby
They was waitin' on me to drop
Like hov and B baby
Went from crappin' in diapers
To rappin' in cyphers
To doing more numbers
Then all them fuckin' lifers in Rikers
You see life is just like a box of chocolates
Never know what you 'bout to get
Take a bite rock wit it
And I love a bad bitch with confidence
Your smile nice yo style right
And girl you got some mean thighs
So this right here is mean time
In between time
Cole World

[Chorus]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Kirko Bangz]
I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mine bomb
Only if you got that sip type
Eat that shit like wonton
Jokin' baby, I'm pimp tight
I'm used to bein' that one and done
But girl you got that g-get right

[Chorus]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

H-town, oh yeah, I got this drink in my cup
I got this drink in my cup
I came down, hold up, hold up, I said hold up
Hold up, I done came down like hold up
Hold up, hold up, fuck, 'chea</pre>
