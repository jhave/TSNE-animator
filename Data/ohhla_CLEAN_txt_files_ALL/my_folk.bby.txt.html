If you like the dark breast and have no job, aight then my folk
Puttin on the ski mask going out and rob, aight then my folk
Coming through the folks house and the lights start flashing, aight then my folk
You high tail so you start laughing, aight then my folk
Got twenty seven doin serious no I.d., aight then my folk
