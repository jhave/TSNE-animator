Song:   I. The Party
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We gon' have a party
All my friends will be there
We drink all vodka
There's music everywhere
Now wait a minute (wait a minute) do you like to party?
Cause if you don't, don't come over here
We got smoking (blue dream)
Drinking (Cocaine)
Fucking
I wanna show you what it is

Thought I was done but that wasn't the case
Got a new stack that I threw in your face
Got a new girl and she look Mila Kunis
Infinity pool, and a statue that's Buddhist
Got bottles and bottles and bottles of Grino
Saw I was rich, now they fuckin' with 'Bino
Brown leather bag, the vacation Messina
The boat in the harbor, I rule the marina
10K for the drinks, now they say I'm insane
It's been that for a minute, now Hedi Slimane
I been black, lucrative, since Danity Kane
Who came back for a minute, now everything changed
High as a kite, lime in the light
Y'all niggas might whine every night
I invite all these people to my motherfuckin' house
Get the fuck out of my house!</pre>
