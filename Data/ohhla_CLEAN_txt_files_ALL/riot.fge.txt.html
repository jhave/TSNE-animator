[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Yo Serj, pass me that lighter
Yeah... yeah, yeah!

[Serj] Flowers, smiling through the battlefield!

[Verse One: Wyclef Jean]
The break is over man, I'm back with the ink pen
Like Ali bomaye okay I'm on my second wind
Used to roll dice when the luck was on my side man
Four-five-six, walked away with a grand man
Seen many blocks turn to the Twilight Zone
D.A. on the case like Sherlock Holmes
My old high school sweetheart started sniffin a bone
For the right bag she deep throat, deeper than a baritone
I caught you off guard, this verse is unexpected, check it
Like when I rhymed on Big Pun's record, check it
I got a swagger that cut any rapper mind over matter
Lyrical dagger like alcohol I'm bad for your liver
Quiver, shiver body temperature get found in Hudson River
Deliver a message to your miss you won't be comin over
And if you on the street tonight, see that ReFugee logo
We beam around the world like satellite

[Chorus One: Wyclef Jean]
It's them hip-hop boys, turn your radio down
It's the rock 'n roll boys, turn your radio down
It's them reggae boys, turn your radio down
Neighbors mind your business
It's a riot again! The world is getting nervous
So we travel again! Main journey's the unconscious
It's a riot again! The world is getting nervous
And so we travel again! Main journey's the unconscious

[Verse Two: Sizzla] + (Wyclef)
Come rooooooooock with me~!
I got the music on the block with me
Come chill on the spoooooot with me
And just laugh in spree
Yeah you're right, we got enough for everyone
So get all your friends and your families and come along
Move to the beat that's all we do we got Jerusalem
Everyday we offer praises like King Solomon
Ain't gon' hurt ye, don't be nervous
I'm your guardian angel, know you purpose
And if I look at you low, if I should make it
Believe me, I leave you, show you how to make it
(Hung up high, in the M-I)
(Double-S-I, S-S-I)
(P-P-I, three-piece tie)
(Wanna see me die so the heavens they cry)

[Chorus Two: Wyclef Jean]
It's them hip-hop boys, turn your radio down
It's the rock 'n roll boys, turn your radio down
It's them reggae boys, turn your radio down
Neighbors mind your business
It's a riot! Riot! Riot! Riot!
From the train to the plane, security check
From the bridge to the tunnel, security check
It's a riot again! The world is getting nervous
So we travel again! Main journey's the unconscious
It's a riot again! The world is getting nervous
And so we travel again! Main journey's the unconscious

[Verse Three: Wyclef Jean]
I was down in Texas; drivin wreckless
Police stop me, axe me for my license (oh yeah)
Registration so I played him some Elvis
He let me go, then I lit off the chalice
I said if things don't change, we headed for the Arma-ged-deon
And the great dragon with seven head, ten horns, at the Arma-ged-deon
Listen to the choir children

[Verse Four: Serj Tankian]
The matterings of all matter
Masters and their extended batters
Internet intelligence for investments for the natural world
Their divestments; truth is knowledge
Although bi-polar if it's attainment is equitable
Man's mirrors face the flesh but hide the spirit
in opposite worlds; vision can only be attained universally
Lamps of varied sizes and shapes carrying different shades
All having the propensity to illuminate
Let's ruminate on realization that the means is the end
The Earth's water is mirroring the stream-of-consciousness
The dead being reborn as flowers smiling through the battlefields

[Wyclef Jean] + (Serj)
It's them hip-hop boys, turn your radio down
It's the rock 'n roll boys, turn your radio down
(Flowers, smiling through the battlefield!)

[repeat to 21 seconds before the end]
It's a riot again! The world is getting nervous
So we travel again! Main journey's the unconscious
It's a riot again! The world is getting nervous
And so we travel again! Main journey's the unconscious</pre>
