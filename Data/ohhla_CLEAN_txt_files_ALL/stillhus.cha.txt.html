[Chorus]
I'm so tiiiired of this game but I don't wanna live life strugglin
(Life live strugglin), so I'm still hustlin (I'm still hustlin)
I'm so tiiiired of this game but I don't wanna live life strugglin
(Life live strugglin), so I'm still hustlin (I'm still hustlin)

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Still hustlin, check it
And now I'm movin on to bigger chores, now it's plenty city tours
Used to ride the Civic, now I'm doin business in the Porsche
First I open up the booth, then I'm walkin in the doors
Everytime I'm in it, I be feelin like it's intercourse ('course)
Went in it raw and they scream soon as I came
And Koopa was the name that every woman would blame
But I am not the father 'cause me and you ain't the same (why?)
The whole rap game is impregnated with lames (lames)
Showin off your little chain, rappin like your Lil Wayne
Actin like ya really bang, thinkin you the illest thang (uh)
You ain't on your business man, mostly of y'all should feel ashamed
Why'd you trade your soul, if you can't get a bit of fame?
And they argue that I was once in that position
But they liars, I never had to beg for you to listen (woo)
Muslim or a Christian but they on another mission
'Cause people treat ya like God when you in my position (Amen)
Soon as ya get a Rover, it's like everybody for ya (yeah)
And givin out ya number, it's like everybody mobile
'Cause everybody's spiritual when they the ones below ya (woo)
And even Jigga got killers that's callin him Jehovah
I got a little hate for all the fakers I confess ('fess)
And that's the reason that I'm steady switchin my address
Our test (yes), is tried to get paid like Artest
And yes (yes), I happen to be the best, I guess, I'm just

[Chorus]</pre>
