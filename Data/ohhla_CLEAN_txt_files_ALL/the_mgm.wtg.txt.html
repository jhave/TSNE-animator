[both]  Yo, up in the M.G.M. coked up
[Ghost] Sike!  Six niggaz walked in flashing they gems peace
[Rae]   Aight! One dark skinned nigga fifty-six inch rope
        wrapped around twice
[Ghost] Smash the Gilligan boat with ice
[Rae]   They threw sign language
[Ghost] Ordered hot coffee
[both]  wit a danish
[Ghost] Relax -- whispered, "They rap entertainers"
[Rae]   Had Lizzy on, two Japanese birds with furs look good kid
[Ghost] Laid back handlin hors d'ourves
[Rae]   It's like round three
[Ghost] We too black for BET
        You memorize the 1 to 40
[Rae]   I'm at the 19th degree
        If a civilized person doesn't perform, his duty
        What shall be done?
[Ghost] Pardon me God, that nigga gotta gun
        Bulgin out his sweatpants, check out his stance
        See the side of his grill?
[Rae]   Look like my cousin Lance
        Left hand rock a Guess watch
[Ghost] Yo I think I did his Clarks he wore the crush bone leather
        with the strings dark
[Rae]   Now I remember
[Ghost] He from Bear Mountain
        He and Mitch Greene shot the fair one
[Rae]   Near the water fountain
[Ghost] Seventh round, Chavez bleedin from his right ear
        Yo keep ya eye on that same nigga from right here
[Rae]   Popcorn spilling all on Liz Claiborne
        Ghost had the fly Gucci mocks wit no socks on
        Seen Deion Sanders in the back with the fat fur on
[Ghost] Workin dem hoes with the fly Wu shirts on
        Mixed drink session Dunn
[Rae]   Pour me some more
[Ghost] Chef leathered down blinking at Chante Moore
[Rae]   Tenth round Chavez tearin em down
[Ghost] Sweet Pea get ya shit off
[Rae]   It's like blacks against the Germans
[Ghost] Gettin hit off
[Rae]   Smooth and them walked in
[Ghost] Brownsville representin
[Rae]   They sent a bottle over, autograph blessin
[Ghost] Chef pull out the doodle twist the dank pink noodles
[Rae]   Yo I'm bout to roll one
[Ghost] Matter fact twist two of those
[Rae]   Yo they wound up stoppin the fight
        Steels took a point away from Chavez
[Ghost] Rematch scheduled on October Ninth
