To the beat...

(To the beat y'all
To the beat y'all
To the - to the 
To the beat y'all)

And yes y'all
This one goes out to all the homeboys
&gt;From the old school
Takin you way, way back
When we used to rhyme like this

Check it out
[ VERSE 1 ]
Ain't nothin but a party, everybody come along
Keep your body movin while I'm groovin with the song
I got funky rhythms, funky rhythms with a beat
Funk-funk-funk-funky rhythms for the street
Keep clappin while I'm rappin, while I'm rappin, clap your hands
Listen to the, listen to the, listen to the man
Turn the party out without a doubt I'm in the house
Kick it to the beat is what it's really all about
Party, party people, if you're ready, listen up
Cause I can get the lyrics, Easy Lee can get the cut
An automatic systematic rhythmatic sound
If you ain't with the program, you gotta get it down
Breakin competition, competition's ripped apart
Find another brother, cause L.L. ain't got the heart
I can take a rhythm, make you sing it like a song
This is To The Beat, you can forget Da Break Of Dawn

(To the beat y'all
To the beat y'all
To the - to the 
To the beat y'all)

[ VERSE 2 ]
If I'm mentally conditioned, then I'm physically prepared
To cold rock a party with the microphone I bear
I'm ready for action, satisfaction guaranteed
Give the people what they want, and what they want is what they need
Desperately to hear a brother kick a rhyme like this
Don't settle for another, cause you know what time it is
Time to pick your feet up, put your body in the mode
And listen to a real rap veteran explode
Other sucker brothers always comin incomplete
Forget about the lyrics, cause they only want the beat
And other punk brothers put a curse in every verse
Frontin cause nobody taught em how to rhyme first
Frontin like you're hard, but it's only a facade
And now you're goin out like a sucker like Todd
But I can take a rhythm, make you sing it like a song
This is To The Beat, you can forget Da Break Of Dawn

(To the beat y'all
To the beat y'all
To the - to the 
To the beat y'all)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Excercisin patterns, sowin up the rappin scene
Rockin for the people like a funky rap machine
Synchronize a party cause the party people watch
Only dancin when I tell em cause I rock round the clock
Masters of the ceremony's one and only one
Can rock it like a rocket, phoney homies better run
Cause I'm doin the damage and the damage will be done
Lyrics are the bullets, so I never need a gun
Just a microphone, speakers, tables and a plug
Sit back and watch the people cut themselves and slice a rug
And I'ma rock a party till it's time to bring it home
And when they pull a plug, then I'ma pack a microphone
Put it in my holster like a gun, and then I'm gone
Strapped, ready to rap and on and on and on
I can take a rhythm, make you sing it like a song
This is To The Beat, you can forget Da Break Of Dawn

(To the beat y'all
To the beat y'all
To the - to the 
To the beat y'all)

And yes y'all
As we proceed to move on
'To Da Break Of Dawn'
He-he-he-he-he...
Takin you all the way back 
The way we used to do it for you and yours
At the old school
