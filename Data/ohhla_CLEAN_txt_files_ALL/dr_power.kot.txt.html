Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Drunk with power (power, power, power)

[D-Loc]
Aye yo, D-Double you can call me dash
Dont talk no suck, bitch ass get slapped
pants sag, give a fuck like the president
drop a bomb smoke a joint quicker then a gangsta step
talk to me soft bout serve a muthafucka up
turn into the double when I spit
Cuz the heat from the fire burns ??
Fuck a pussy, dont make me start callin out names
Cause I dont really give a fuck about your claims
Calm down think before you speak
Put 'em in the state of mind now its plain deep
Its the D he gots no D
Stop fuckin with me I let the heat pop
let me in this punk muthafucka while the beat drop

[Chorus]
Drunk with power (power, power, power)
Pot resistance
persue the life of liberty
Drunk with power (power, power, power)
Propostition
resistance to the enemy
Drunk with power (power, power, power)
Pot resistance
you'll never get the best of me
Drunk with power (power, power, power)
Proposition
?? drug of industry
Drunk with power (power, power, power)
Pot resistance
you'll never get the best of me

[Daddy-X]
Lately daily its kinda crazy
once twice three times a lady
Mary jane-zee she makes me hazy
pigs roll bother dont wanna graze me
it dont faze me cuz rhymes they pay
I sing these songs till my dyin day
Lay stretched out flat in a cannabis coffin
So think of the offer when your packin your bong hits
(Pot resistance)
Daddy-x a last two rebel
horny white devil, on another level
(Pot resistance)
I roll through with the east side flyin'
change my sirens, politicians lyin
(Pot resistance)
I keep grindin, politics is grindin
In my vaporizer so I'm always vaporizen'

[Chorus]

[Johnny Richter]
Remember back in the day when they had probation
now its a plant that'll end you up in prison
whats your posistion on the status today
alcohols good to go, but smoke some weed no way
You get locked up they simpy throw away the keys
Sounds like someones got a grudge, if you ask me
it aint right, whos to say whats what
Call me wrong if I'm high while your drunk as fuck
(Pot resistance)
I aint givin in now and I wont give in never
(Pot resistance)
Alcohol takes lives, but pot no one dies
(Pot resistance)
I aint givin in now and I wont give in never
(Pot resistance)
alcohol takes lives, but pot no one dies

Drunk with power (power, power, power)
Pot resistance
persue the life of liberty
Drunk with power (power, power, power)
Propostition
resistance to the enemy
Drunk with power (power, power, power)
Pot resistance
you'll never get the best of me
Drunk with power (power, power, power)
Proposition
?? drug of industry
Drunk with power (power, power, power)
Pot resistance
Drunk with power (power, power, power)
Pot resistance
Drunk with power (power, power, power)
Pot reisstance
Drunk with power (power, power, power)
Pot resistance
Drunk with power (power, power, power)</pre>
