[Intro: Sample]:
It's New York! I can make my most fantastic dreams, come true

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz] (Swizz Beatz vocals scratched by DJ Camillo) 
(DJ Camillo scratching samples from the original version on "En Why Cee")
Where the-Wh-Wh-Where-Where The Bronx at?!
(Joell Ortiz: Yeah! Bronx, Manhattan, Staten, Queens and Brooklyn!!!)
Wh-Wh-Wh-Where Queens at?!
(Juganot: Got a walk with an awk-awk-awkward swagger)
Where Brook-Br-Br-Brooklyn at?!
(Uncle Murda: Drama in-in-in-in-in New York)
Where-Wh-Wh-Wh-Where Harlem at?!
It's showti-ti-ti-time!!!!!!

[Verse 1: Juganot]
Yeah! I'm from N-Y-C me on the ave
Turn your radio up be easy on the gas
This the remix we need it for the class
Of two thousand eight summer flew so fast
Juganot cookin they ass the whole reason
Cats get panic attacks they all wheezin
Tearin it down in each town do this for the people, this here is the sequel
Niggas is senile thinkin we ain't about it
The reason we stressed cause we so overcrowded
Word! That's the reason my city so violent
Word! We work two jobs to balance the absurd
Cost of livin your better give
A hundred and ten percent of an effort if, extra competitive
Kids stay in school, lay off the sedatives
Question the government in whatever they tellin us
We rebellious we back home we sayin leave Iraq alone! Uh huh! Yeah!
And put your hand in the air
If you wanna see your soldiers back at home
Come on!!

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Where the-Wh-Wh-Where-Where-Where The Bronx at?!
Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)
Where Queens at?! Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)
Where Brooklyn at?! Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)
Where Harlem at?! Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah! To give a fuck what niggas talk
If you ain't know my whole jewelry collection is New York nigga
From drug spots to the strips they holdin the fort
In front of Pancho's Deli burnin them phillies and Newports nigga
With the spirit of hustlers in hip hop was submitted
Home and origin and swag and the big chain was invented
The place is known I said it and light the fire and scorch
On some Statue Of Liberty shit we always carryin the torch
Block party properly put the speaker out on the porch
You know the type to dial up in the boroughs fuck what you thought
Tattoo and carve the city in my skin it could live with me
Out of town niggas rockin New York fitted religiously
It's all good I respect the way niggas live it
Frontin and follow what we do like New York all in they spirit
I don't think you niggas ready to play in this thug sport
Just get it right homey! It's! New! York!

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Where the-Wh-Wh-Where-Where-Where The Bronx at?!
Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)
Where Queens at?! Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)
Where Brooklyn at?! Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)
Where Harlem at?! Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
COOK!!!! C-R-A-C-K (K)
Started with the kush and moved the yay (Yay)
I can go on and on rap phenomenon cause I'm the don and ummm.......
Cocaine City, boat game silly
I've been runnin these streets like I'm Diddy
You've been one of the niggas that could kill me
But they not, I'm still hot
More money more mansions more yachts
More bitches more whips more rocks
Independence Day, jackpot!
You couldn't count how many m's I got
Hundred guns hundred clips get the swag up
Oh they callin you a snitch bet you that sucks
New York big city of dreams
Get money keep feedin them fiends and I'm out

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Where the-Wh-Wh-Where-Where-Where The Bronx at?!
Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)
Where Queens at?! Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)
Where Brooklyn at?! Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)
Where Harlem at?! Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)

[Verse 4: Reek Da Villian]
N-E-W-Y-O-R-K!!!! I'm from Strong I-S-L-A-N-D
Where the crackheads will stick you up
Take a hit of the glass dick
Come through with that fifth and lit you up
Five boroughs of insanity
And them Jersey mu'fuckers like family
Where the ugliest chick will tell you she look like Amerie
Like Grace Jones sayin she favor Vanity
So, we quick to hit 'em and diss 'em like get lost
Kick her out with her clothes on backwards like Kriss Kross
Leave her with, more shit on her than Rick Ross
Like Lil' Mama I enjoyed ya lip gloss
No matter the bridge the coupe will serve with it
Merge in it especially the CL to chirp in it
When we left the worms in it the apple was perfected
Now you smell the foulness in the air it's your city New York

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Where the-Wh-Wh-Where-Where-Where The Bronx at?!
Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)
Where Queens at?! Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)
Where Brooklyn at?! Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)
Where Harlem at?! Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)</pre>
