Song:   Hollywood Hoes
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus x2]
I'm livin' life fast, sometimes you slow down but I continue speedin'
The New York nights, Miami beaches, and Hollywood Hoes
I'm fresh out the air so you won't see me there
unless I'm weedin' (weedin)
That's all I know
Oh oh oh (oh oh)

I work hard, niggas hardly work
Smoke good Swishers, ya'll hit dirt
Talk bad 'bout that Taylor Gang swag (swag)
Now we hit the club in that small T-shirt
Hopin' that somebody will notice him
I'm chavo chasin', that money keep rollin' in
I step on stage and they say he's goin' in
Four hoes tryna leave with me and the motorman
I'm blunt roastin', on a cloud just coastin'
Shift once and I'm speedin'
On my way outer space
A couple niggas in this race
But its one that I'm leadin'
Hoes see me think they dream (dreamin')
I'm a star
Drive a space ship sweetie, not a car
Come on dog, we ain't gotta wait for the weekend
I'll hit the West Coast and be back for the weekend (back for the weekend)
Swag!

[Chorus x2]</pre>
