[Intro]
Yeah, that's right!
It's tiiiiime, to set the record straight

[Verse One]
Ain't nobody got to spell it for me
I said ain't nobody got to yell that can see
I said ain't nobody got to pay that can hear
But if I have to I'll yell in your earrrrrrrr!

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Time for livin, time for givin

[Verse Two]
Check this out
Ain't nobody got to spell it for me
I said ain't nobody got to yell that can see
I said ain't nobody got to pay that can hear
But if I have to I'll yell in your earrrr!

[Interlude]
Soul fire!! Soul fire!!
And we ain't got no water
We don't got no water

[Outro: repeat 2X]
Time for livin, time for givin
No time for makin up a monster to sell</pre>
