Song:   Roads Less Traveled
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way
I take the roads less travelled I'll see you again some day
I take the roads less travelled well I'm on my way

When I was a young boy people try to tell me what I should be
And then a wise man sang decide your own destiny
Aunty said choices you make chances you take
To be free to be free to be free I got to be brave

I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way
I take the roads less travelled I'll see you some day

Now my daddy had a lot of women and my mama had a lot of grief
And the brethrens that surrounded him became the enemies
Cause greed can't be satisfied by money and jealousy's a disease
Oh if you don't learn from history what a blind man see

I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way
I take the roads less travelled see you again one day

The more I love the more hurt I feel
And that's all right by me cause that's just how I be
I could be like a brother sold out for a million dollar
I could be like a brother despising one another

And aunty said choices you make chances you take
And to be free to be free to be free you got to be brave

I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way
I take the roads less travelled I'll see you some day
I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way</pre>
