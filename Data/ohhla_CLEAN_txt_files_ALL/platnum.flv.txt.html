[Flavor Flav]
Blat 'em, blat 'em, I'm goin double platinum
I'm goin triple platinum, I'm sellin crazy mad platinum
Everybody buy this record yo
Then come see me performin at my show
And watch me pack the house (say what?)
Everybody goin crazy yo without a doubt
Everybody come on and get up off the wall
Everybody come on and let's have a ball

[Interlude]
We rock, we roll
Oh yes this beat is cold
It gets deep in your soul
And makes you very bold
It makes you wanna dance
It makes you wanna sing

[Flavor Flav]
Everybody come on and get up off the wall
Everybody come on and let's have a ball

[Chorus]

[Flavor Flav]
I got the jam, I got the jam
Flavor Flav's got the jam
Everybody come on and dance this
Guys grab that girl and romance to this
You've only got one chance at this
I'm throwin 900 grands at this
Everybody get up and do the damn thing
Get down with Flavor Flav and sing

[Interlude]

[Flavor Flav]
Everybody get up and do the damn thing
Get down with Flavor Flav and sing

[Chorus] - repeat 3X

[Flavor Flav]
