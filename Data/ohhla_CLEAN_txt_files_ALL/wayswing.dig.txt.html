Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yo Shock man people be comin up to me sayin
"Yo man, what's up with the Underground, man?
 You guys old school, new school, R&amp;B or hip-hop?"
What should I tell em?

Now this is not your average everyday rap song
We won't be rockin bells that go a ding and a dong
The bass drummer hipper won't be lingering on
Check out the way we kick it on the microphone
The funky beat is playin and we're swingin along
The Underground is rockin with the hip-hop song
The drums are ringin with the serious tone
Ah clock this y'all, we're on the microphone
Ah MC's, you like the way we swing
Well listen close and make sure you don't miss a thing
Don't you know that we're the microphone masters
Known to MC's as the raw dog bastards
We bust rhymes, and write everyday
So listen close, to the things that we say
Triple-slippin MC's will get verbally raped
We'll send you home with that look on your face
And just rock this, you can't stop this
Ah just rock this, try and clock this (try and clock this)
The funky beat is playing and we're swingin along
The Underground is rockin with the hip-hop song
The funky drums is ringin with the serious tone
Ah clock this y'all, we're on the microphone
Ah MC's, ya like the way we swing (ya like the way we swing)
Cause America, likes the way we swing

MC's, you like the way we swing
I hope you do, cause if you don't it don't mean a thing
See we don't play for other hip-hop crews, it's not about you
We do the things that we wanna do
We're MC's to please the loyal followers
But you you're just a sucker hip-hop borrower
Your real name is probably Bradworth or Bennett
Your verbal baggage ain't got nuthin in it
You think that you're rockin but you're not hip-hoppin
So you best stop jockin at the masters
MC's, you like the way we swing (you like the way we swing)
Yeah, cause America, likes the way we swing

MC's, you like the way we swing (you like the way we swing)
The Queen told you that you're nothing but an underling
We're talkin trash, we kick it kind of cocky
You can't deny it though the drums are good and sloppy
The funky beat is playin and we're swingin along
The Underground is rockin with the hip-hop song
The funky drums are ringin with the serious tone
Ah clock this y'all, we're on the microphone
Ah MC's, like the way we swing (they like the way we swing)
Cause America, likes the way we swing
[whispered] You're triple-slippin you're triple-slippin
You're triple-slippin (yo man) you rhyme like a school teacher
About convincing as a preacher, who smokes reefer
Why don't you give it up just put the mic down
Get out of town with that noise, this is the underground
Not your average everyday rap crew
You can tell by the things we say the things that we do
The funky beat is playin and we're swing along
Ah clock this y'all, we're on the microphone
Ah MC's, you like the way we swing (ya like the way we swing)
Cause America, ahh, likes the way we swing
And ya don't stop

MC's...		they don't know
MC's...		they don't know
MC's...		they don't know
MC's...		what I know
DJ's...		they don't know
DJ's...		they don't know
DJ's...		they don't know
DJ's...		what I know

See we have no time for suckers
Who bite with their lowers and their uppers
We came here to play and what we really wanna say
is MC's, why don't you take the chill pill
You really need to listen to the way we spill
ah these rhymes, we don't have time to drop a dime
Everytime a sucker thief gets away with a line
Their mouths keep suckin cause they ain't got nothin
But they best stop FUCKIN with the masters
MC's, you like the way we swing (you like the way we swing)
Yeah, cause America, likes the way we swing
MC's, you like the way we swing
Cause Africa, likes the way we swing
MC's, you like the way we swing
Cause down in Australia, they love the way we swing
MC's, you like the way we swing
Yo, cause Zimbabwe, likes the way we swing (and ya don't stop)
Ahh, MC's, you like the way we swing
Cause over in the Phillipines, they love the way we swing
Yeah, MC's, you like the way we swing
Don't you know the UK y'all, likes the way we swing
Ahh, MC's, hah you like the way we swing
Even in Cleveland, they like the way we swing
MC's, you like the way we swing
Japan, likes the way we swing
(Kick it Shock) and ya don't stop
Ah keep on gonna rock til we hit the top
Ah one time, in your mind y'all
Get busy, get busy, get busy, get busy...
