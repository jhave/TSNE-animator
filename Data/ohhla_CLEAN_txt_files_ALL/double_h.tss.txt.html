[Intro]
Dubba dubba, dubba dubba
Dubba dubba dubba dubba dubba

[Too $hort]
Girl why you wanna bother me?
I already tried that monogamy
I been stopped datin young college freaks
But don't start tryin to Bill Cosby
Now get butt-naked let's fuck some mo'
Bitch, we cain't be the Huxtables
For me - that's like suicide
If I ever get married I want two rides~!

[Chorus: Wallpaper]
Fatty girl; go and grab a friend for me
One + one could equal three, satisfaction guaranteed
Fatty girl; you and her and her and me
Hot tub full of Hennessy, do it 'til we overheat
(One is fun, but two is better; dubba dubba dubba doubleheader) {*2X*}

[Too $hort]
Yo' wife is the warden
Stay out all night she might issue a warrant
A straight APB
And if you locked out the house you cain't stay with me
Musta got paroled cause you out now
Last few years you was locked down
Don't come to my house cause this different here
Better go back home and be Cliff and Claire
I never would marry no Wedding Singer
I want twins, that look like Brittney Binger
A pretty actress like Make More Money
You can have her - gimme two Playboy Bunnies
I tell my wives to cum/come to me
I know you not havin mo' fun than me
If you in love need to pop the question
If you a player don't stop the session

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Dubba dubba, dubba dubba
Dubba dubba dubba doubleheader
Dubba dubba, dubba dubba
Dubba dubba dubba doubleheader
(One is fun, but two is better)
Now get butt-naked let's fuck some mo'
(One is fun, but two is better)
Now get butt-naked let's fuck some mo'
(One is fun, but two is better)
Now get butt-naked let's fuck some mo'
{*"some mo'" echoes until fade*}</pre>
