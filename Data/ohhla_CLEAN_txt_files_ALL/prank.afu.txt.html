[Afu-Ra]
Back in the days, I never snatched pocket books
I just snatch ya mind up with the flow and the hook
That's right, be on alert, coming faster
Corny mc's, body snatcher with the rapture
Dismember ya body, like I was a raptor
Tuck ya eyes out, so you can't see my laughter
Don't care how many gold and platinum plaques you got
I put my foot in your ass, up in the spot
A beast break necks, that's right, you couldn't sit through
I'm bone crushing on the mic like a pitbull
Foamin' at the mouth, ferocious, to start again
Rockin' hardbody cardigen, with the timberlands
P.F. drop the beat, Afu drop the grammar
Was swift with the gift, old school like cold bangers
The five mic slangin', head bangin', chitty chitty bang bangin'
Name your whole rap crew, like I'm gang bangin'

[Chorus: Afu-Ra]
You ain't no gangsta rapper, you'se an amateur
I seen you back in the days, they used to laugh at ya
You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you just a poser
I grab the mic and do it like it's supposed ta'
You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you just a wanksta
I schooled you back in the days, you just a prankster
You ain't no gangsta, rapper, you'se an amateur
I saw you back in the days, they used to laugh at ya

[Afu-Ra]
Am I brothers keeper? Don't get swept beneath the rug
Stomp these posers out, like they water bugs
Tired of these rappers, with these ice mugs
Clamining that they spitting slugs, but they spitting duds
Tired of these fake thugs, that's lighter than feathers
With all that nonsense, they puttin together, screaming murder murder
I thought they would of learned from Biggie and 2Pac
That you can bring to life, what you spittin' in your art
You ain't no gangsta, nigga, you'se a wanksta
I schooled you back in the days, you just a pranksta
You ain't no gangsta, rapper, you'se an amateur
I saw you back in the days, they used to laugh at ya
It's Mr. Spectacular, tacular
Bout to swat that ass out the sky like he gammara
The flex of ego, on your little pedestool
In front of your people, now what you wanna do?

[Chorus]

[Afu-Ra]
You can't stop this hard rock, rock, ready to rock this
I got lyrical ability, to bring ya hot shit
I swat so many cats, it's raining birds
Cause I'm cold as ice, forget the ice in ya watch, kid
Spit more flames than the back of a rocket
Mic check, one-two, linin' up my targets
I be the mad man in front of the cam
That be stealing ya fans, yup, up on the red carpet
Make more connections than Nextel, ring the bell
On first connection, make ya fucking lips swell
Make more noise than a terrorist attack
I'm dangerous like anthrax, my voice burn up the wax
Against the way, I put my self up on the map
I'm a dope MC, I put the squeeze on the dope tracks
Body care free, on the dope tracks
A hundred round banana clip, leave you where you at

[Chorus]</pre>
