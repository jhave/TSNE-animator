Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Backwood of that good to the pain for the brain
A cup of lean for me to sleep see I be going through things
Music business got me stressed Xanax to maintain
Waking up on wrong sides got me writing in vain
Vicodin to numb me up help me cope with the struggle
Remember praying to get in there saying rap to my brothers
And now I got the whole world listening
Give your ear for a second a life changing decision
Every other minute thoughts run through my mind
About how bad I wanted this but I cannot waste time
So I'm trapped in the beat stuck on every line
Nothing else matters except my next rhyme
You can never understand all the pressure I'm against
Getting high thinking how to make it better than your last shit
Might have a mental breakdown
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on
Nigga I float on

[Chorus x4: Charli XCX]
I float on
Let's go
Hop up in the Chevy 4 door let's roll

[Verse 2]
Remember back when mommy sent me for the Wonder Bread
And niggas jumped me stomped on my fucking head
It's like I learned right then you either sink or you swim
And to beat your enemy you gotta think like them
So I was up late breaking day with the gremlins
Music in my heart but my thoughts wouldn't listen
Hood outta bye bye cause rap shit was sci-fi
So I'm tormented with the things I seen with these eyes
Can't get a wink unless I'm leaning off of syrup
Dreaming of my past like a nightmare so I wake up
Staring at the ceiling with this feeling that won't go away
Until the verse is done wrote all day but them shits throwaway
So I'm breaking day sniffing Adderall writing
And not for the money for the life after dying
Pray I get old just to hear I been the future
Just to see my influence in this genre of music
And might make it to see somehow
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on
Nigga I float on

[Chorus x4: Charli XCX]</pre>
