(*talking*)
EQ (yeah), Thug Dirt
What you thought, we was falling off
What you thought, the South wasn't gon come hard
What you thought, we was weak
Nigga this H-Town, nigga we run shit
Who you think, you listening to motherfucker
This the Screwed Up Click

[Lil' Keke]
I represent the S.U.C., I'm Lil' Ke'
I'm creased jeans, AF-1's and white T
The best kept secret, out the 7-1-3
From the streets of pistol play, cause it don't matter to me
If you searching for the Don, niggaz look no mo'
I'm in a tinted black truck, white cups and dro
Don't start no shit, it won't be no blood
I'm a Custom Made Gangsta, and mixed with thug
Herschelwood till I die, that's the name of my block
Battle scars and plenty wars, I did it rock for rock
I'ma smash on boys, when they play these games
Bullet wounds to the chest, when they say these names
My skills are boosted up, I'm getting scary
I tell these niggaz, that I'm already legendary
And fresh off the porch, it ain't no fucking with me
And I still'll bust a head, for the S.U.C

[Hook]
Don't start no shit, won't be no shit
It's the Don, I represent the Screwed Up Click
Don't start no shit, won't be no shit
It's Sensei biting the mic, I'm still a hard pit
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit
It's Boss Hogg Corleone, and I'm back in the mix
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit
It's the Screwed Up Click, it's the Screwed Up Click

[Big Pokey]
The money the house, the Jag the six
Call me Slick, I'm the dude with the bag of tricks
It's a drought, powder pack brick mad the bench
Took it back got a nug', now I'm back in the mix
I get mine on the edge of the booth, ready to jump
3600 block of the Yella', that's where I'm from
For really, I'm fin's to show these niggaz the dealy
Then wrap this bitch up, like endo in a filly
Fuck the keys to the city, I'ma pick the lock
If the jump boys raiding tonight, pick the spot
The niggaz that start shit, we trying to get dead
I twist niggaz dump em, and mail they mama the head
Sensei's in the building, start dropping your bread
My album's like bird shit, drop and spread
Y'all know how I play it, low to the ground
S.U.C. motherfucker, controlling the town

[Hook]

[Mike D]
See now they gon goon 'head, and make me hurt a man
C-walked off on em, and do the murder dance
See the print in my pants, that's my trusted 3-80
In your ass pocket size, so I can hit you in your cocky eyes
Grew up on Pac, don't know nothing bout me
I'ma ride and die, with the S.U.C
And it's Boss Hogg daddy, Miggity Mike D
Got these niggaz out here sick, like I let the pen let free
I survived long summers, in white suits and boots
Now back in the mix, in a 5-60 coupe
With a 50-Cal in my lap, ready to let loose
I got the game in choke hold, these niggaz in a neuse
The game done gave me my F, boys know what I'ma do
Get six down chicks, make six round trips
Make six dimes flip, talk cash money shit
It's Boss Hogg Corleone, Screwed Up Click nigga
