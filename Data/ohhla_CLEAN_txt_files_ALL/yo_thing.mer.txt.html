Mercedes, (Peaches) talking

Hello?
(May I speak to Mercedes?)
Yeah, this me.
(Is JaQuon over there?)
Who?
(JaQuon)
Oh.

Verse 1L (Mercedes)

Let me tell you about your baby daddy
Waking me up early in the morning, we gone and
How you know he's creeping with me
How you think I know you get off of work around three
I suppose you want to sit and chat 
Probably wondering where your man is at
So why you keep on sweating me, testing me
When it's truly plain to see where he wanna be
Right here next to me

Chorus: (Mercedes, Peaches)
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
Me and you come all over we can do this thang
(What you gonna do, what what, what you gonna do, if you get it huh
What you gonna do, what what, what you gonna do, if you get it huh)
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
Me and you come all over we can do this thang
(What you gonna do, what what, what you gonna do, if you get it huh
What you gonna do, what what, what you gonna do, if you get it huh)

Verse 2: (Master P)

Me tell no lies, yeah I like to ride
Keep your eyes on the prize, tell your homegirls don't cry
Say uhhh when you get it, I'm a solider when I hit it
Hoody hooo when I get it, I told you wasn't no limit
At four circle, I'm a V-12, girl can't you tell
I'll rock your bells from eight to twelve
Make you want like a dog, my name below your drawers
I know you want it all, ha ha ha ha, but don't fall

Chorus:

It's your thing, do what you wanna do
Me and you come all over we can do this thang
(What you gonna do, what what, what you gonna do, if you get it huh
What you gonna do, what what, what you gonna do, if you get it huh)
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
Me and you come all over we can do this thang
(What you gonna do, what what, what you gonna do, if you get it huh
What you gonna do, what what, what you gonna do, if you get it huh)

Verse 3: (Mercedes)

Let me tell you about your baby daddy
Waking me up early in the morning, we gone and
How you know he's creeping with me
How you think I know you get off of work around three
I suppose you want to sit and chat 
Probably wondering where your man is at
So why you keep on sweating me, testing me
It's truly plain to see where he wanna be
Right here next to me

Peaches:

Ohhh ohhh ohhh 
Ohhh ohhh ohhh
Ohhh ohhh ohhh
You got me twisted callin me about your man
You got me twisted callin me about your man

Master P talking:

You got me twisted girl.

Huh, don't hate the player baby, hate the game.
Matter of fact, why don't yall put these boxing gloves on.
I know you just got your nails and your hair done.
But uh, whoever win, it's your thing boo.
Ha, that's what I'm talkin bout.</pre>
