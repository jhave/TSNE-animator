We deadly
We deadly, ahh
We deadly, ahh
We deadly, ahh
We deadly, ahh
We deadly, ahh

[Mac]
My rap style is kill kill, never forget that
See the wig, you split that, you get that, it's that simple
Talk is cheaper then generic goods
We deadly apostiles, that means respected in every hood
The realest niggas be the illest niggas, he who whispers in the dark
You can see the black in my heart
But that tigers in my eyes when I come through, fuck what you been through
It's bout what you gone do when it come to
You ever dance with the devil cause we can take it to that level
I'm talking ghetto to ghetto just to catch you and wet you
Bless the soul of any nigga I cross
Somewhere in the shuffle we was lost looking for drama at any cost
Love changes, niggas is cut throat, especially when they snort coke
Mac's a minister, I was sent to replenish ya
Nothin can come between us, niggas who try to see us
Probably thanking me for sending them to meet they Jesus

[Mac/(Skull Duggery)]
Ya'll want this war nigga (war)

[Master P]
We riders and I done rolled with the best
See y'all started this mess, now who wanna get wet
I done changed my life and chill cause No Limit pays the bills
Now suckas banging on records, tryin to break down what I build
Before I started this I was a killer, a motherfucking drug dealer
Now who the fuck don't feel us, what's up to my real niggas (hoody hooo)
No Limit Soldiers we back, aim cock the Tec
Rat-a-tat-tat, I hope they got they gat
I'm the big fish, y'all cupcakes, run up on the Tank and get duct taped
Nigga look me up in the dictionary under motherfucking great
Cause I run Atlanta, North Carolina to Alabama
Detriot to Chicago, every ghetto, every slammer
Every dope dealer, every dope spot, from the Calliope to your block
I know why y'all bitches mad at us cause No Limit still hot

[Mac/(Skull Duggery)]
Ya'll want this war nigga (war)
