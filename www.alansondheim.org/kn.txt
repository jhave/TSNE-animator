---------------------------= YTalk version 3.0 (2)------------------------
Oh, this is more beautiful than I could ever imagine. I am ytalking
myself, I, Daishin Nikuko
And then I would come out of the cave to see the jeweled ornaments between
my legs, glistening there between my legs, visible in the light of my sun
And there would be the smell of my body everywhere, like the smell of the
earth, and these would be the jewels to be caressed, the magatima I am
wearing now, curved into me
Curved so they emerged in the form of speech and speaking and the
glistening murmurs of the world
Until our speech is curved itself, dense scent now of love, death, you.
-------------------------= sondheim@panix3.panix.com----------------------
Hi there, my god you've made it through here...
When I was in the cave then was I dancing outside the cave, exposing
myself to myself
And I would grab myself, stop the useless flight back into the darkness,
surely; and the grain would grow, the trees flower, cherry blossoms
everywhere...
Curved into me, like a flower or a seed, curved through my loins, stomach,
through my mouth and throat
Which here I place upon the page for you to read, to comprehend, to pass
down, generation after generation

System going Down in Five Minutes for Immediate Reboot 
System going Down in Two Minutes for Immediate Reboot 
System Going Down Now for Immediate Reboot
System is Down for Immediate Reboot
Oh Help we Cannot Reboot Immediately We Will be With you So Soon
Oh Dear it is Already So Soon and We Still Cannot Reboot
Oh Heavens to Me I am Sure Something Will Grow Pretty Flowers
Oh! Oh! Look at That! Kore Wa Kore Wa Pretty Cherry Mountain Flowers!

There are moments like these, Nikuko thinks, when _the continuity girl_
can go hang herself; there are moments like these when everything col-
lapses, when the mouth of the corpse is stuffed with the year-2000-old 
Y2k cock.

Somewhere there is a thin scream. Somewhere a wire shudders and cools.

The wreck of the culture is the wreck of the planet. Both cool. Everything
tends towards zero. Nikuko thinks: Ground Zero of the Slaughtered System.

It is a promise it will Reboot. It is a promise _Elsewhere_ and such pro-
mises are not often kept. Nikuko thinks. Nikuko tries thinking. How can
I think, says Nikuko, when I am Inside the System? How can I think, cries
Nikuko, when I am Part of the System?

Nikuko stretches her limbs. Somewhere there is a thin scream. Nikuko
wonders how Nikuko thinks When Her System Is Down. Nikuko wonders If You
Are Reading This When Her System Is Down. Somewhere a wire shudders and
cools. Nikuko Spreads Her Limbs.

Nikuko walks around the Wreck of the Culture. It is very quiet. She knows
Burning is being smelled. She spreads herself further. Somewhere there are
Burning Bodies. She spreads herself over The Wreck Of The System.

I can Think you Up, says Nikuko. I can Think You Back To Me.

Zazen


I wrote the following five months ago. I wrote it because the situation
was one I was both accustomed to, daily routine, and unaccustomed to,
Japan. When I wrote it, I was aware that I would be torn from Japan, no
matter what, that I would be elsewhere. When I wrote it, I was living what
was described - that is, the description was a matter of looking around.
Then the text becomes another matter, that of reconstitution, and I am
forced into the position of the reader; such is memory. 

In this fashion, each and every thing becomes virtual and no longer holds
ground, and the differentiations of signifiers also signify the differen-
tiations of circumstances and selves. Behind every memory there is an ava-
tar; behind every avatar there are uneasy dreamings, presentiments. I knew
when I was writing the following that I would not be the one who had writ-
ten the following. I knew this while writing it. I turn around, now again
examine my circumstances, and find such is the case. The gap continues to
grow, and bears the burden of death. When death comes, finally, the gap is
sutured.

Perfection Implied by Relative Invisibility and the Shaking of Hands*

Aesthetics of Perfection


Milner's Communication and Concurrency develops the notion of a _single
perfect action,_ tau (we'll use T) such that, if there are agents
a(A)c' and c(B)b' where x' implies output and otherwise input, then if we
have a(A)c'---->----c(B)b' and A'-->c'-->A (where A' is the state before
c' is released - note that all of this is a handshake communication among
agents - then we can infer A'|B --> A|B' where | is composition. (This is
similar in a way to both something called Petrie graphs and a formalism I
worked on years ago.) The question asked - what is the label of the last
arrow? Milner states that this is T, which references the _single perfect
action_ or handshake. It is internal to the system, and has no complement.
Further, it is not directly observable. Milner regards two systems as
equivalent of course if they exhibit the same ("in some sense") pattern of
external actions. T can figure in graphs such as linear sequences. It does
not figure externally. 

Among other things, Milner uses the formalism for thinking about communi-
cation protocols (such as TCP/IP etc.). There are handshakes, send, and
ack (acknowledgements) involved; a three-way handshake is used in TCP/IP,
interrupted in a SYN attack. I think a model could be developed from this
involving layering such that T could also represent an entire structure
that _appears_ inputless and outputless. Such a structure could be consid-
ered a basis under certain circumstances; thus TCP/IP is nothing that the
end user concerns herself with - and in fact to the extent that protocols
and protocol configurations disappear from the "surface" of communications
technologies, those technologies increasingly appear virtual/real. Thus a
future seamless virtual reality would appear to be an _inhabitation_ (in
the Heideggerian sense), and the "normative" phenomenological horizon of
the subject would be - as if it were - _identically mapped_ in processes
to and from the machinery. We can speak of the bandwidth or raster of
these processes as well. (And are all autonomic processes perfect? And is
there an aesthetics implied?)

In fact, within the book, everything is process; a storage register for
example is defined as put(Reg(y))get' which is, in fact, a representation
of potential operations. The formal definition is Reg(y) def = putx.Reg(x)
+ gety'.Reg(y) - in other words, either put something in or take something
out. Registers - plural - can be indexed in various ways.

Could we then make up for example [TCP/IP] where all T resonate internal-
ly, and where the brackets represent the protocol layers, including the
inputs and outputs - except those pertaining uppermost to the subject and
her communication (actual and potential)?

I realize I know less and less of the modeling process as I continue here.
But what I am concerned with is the notion of perfect actions "below" a
surface, just as software does its job. Within this situation, there would
be disturbances - noise, chaotic noise, parasites, viruses, Trojan horses,
and so forth - through which a particular T would break into its compon-
ents. In such cases, the boundaries or borderlines of invisible processes
become evident; such processes, from the viewpoint of perfection, are
"flawed." It's in this domain that the Nikuko and Jennifer experimentation
has occurred at times, and as perfect sequences are interrupted, their
virtual bodies expand, producing awkward and confused text. The text is
their bones, the confusion their speech.

Milner's book is concerned with scheduling; I like thinking about hand-
shakes, perfections, and breakdowns. Concurrency is critical in parallel
processing - everything runs together smoothly (ideally). Handshaking is
critical when anything communicates with anything else, and although this
is a term from computer science, it's worthwhile to examine it across the
board - from the entrance/exits of a particular email post ("how do I
respond to him or her") to Hall's ethological studies. Liminality, in-be-
tween states, enters into the picture as well - and one might talk about
onset, coherency achievement, perfection, interrupt, denouement, and with-
draw, for example. Whether the formalism would prove useful or not at this
level is moot (I think not actually); it's here that phenomenology, etho-
logy, Lacanian psychoanalytics, and cognitive science come into play. And
it's here I exit as well, riding the bones of Nikuko.

(A final issue, however - the extent to which an aesthetics is, in fact,
implied in perfection. One can consider c and c' as canceling each other
out, a formation of body and antibody bringing A and B into communicative
contact through T; what might be considered an apparent symmetry is
involved. But I also would like to extent this further - into the idea of
the handshake as an art or aesthetics in itself - the perfect inhaling of
breath before a shakuhachi note is played out, for example - as instru-
ment, sound, musical sequence, performer, and breath are adjusted. Think
of approaching a potential lover for the first time - and what vocal,
body, and chemical languages (pheromones) are involved. There are other
examples from molecular biology as well.

Now think of _the beautiful perfection_ of one's eyes, wide-opened, for as
a lover approaches, or as Nikuko, at last, begins to speak...)


*This is speculative and ill-formed; I give in both to my ignorance and
desire to see the concepts through.

Virus in My Brain (Simultaneous Transmission by Nikuko and Alan)


>Date: Tue, 1 Sep 1998 02:05:18 +0900 (JST)
>From: Reminder Service <sondheim@gol.com>
>To: nikuko@gol1.gol.com
>Subject: Tuesday's Calendar

>9/1 move out of loft

I received this missive just today, logging back into gol.com in Japan; 
it's the calendar program import from Panix, referring to September 1997,
never deleted.

It sadly reminds me to leave the loft.

I did leave the loft. I went to gol.com in Japan and then returned to the
loft.

Now I am sadly interred in the loft, and will not move out of the loft,
but will welcome these messages as open memories on the anniversary of
non-moving, before, in fact, when I left for Japan, for I had made
arrangements to return to the loft. So I never did leave the loft, but 
I left the loft. Sadly.

Sadly I am now here, reading the words of Tung-Shan Liang-Chieh, from 
The Transmission of the Lamp, in Chang Chung-Yuan, Original Teachings 
of Ch'an Buddhism:


	 It is strange indeed!
	 It is strange indeed!
	 Dharma taught by non-sentient things is unthinkable.
	 Listening through your ear you cannot understand;
 	 But you will be aware of it by listening with your eyes.

 After presenting the gatha, Liang-chieh took his leave of Master Yun-yen,
who said to him:
 "Where are you going?"
 "Although I am leaving you, I have no idea where my next stop will be,"
replied Liang-chieh.
 "Are you not going south of the Lake?" asked Yun-yen.
 "No!" said Liang-chieh.
 "Then are you returning to your native town?" asked Yun-yen.
 The answer from Liang-chieh was again no. Then Yun-yen continued, "Come
back here soon." 
 "When you become the head of a monastery, I will come back to you,"
replied Liang-chieh.
 "After you leave here, it will be very hard for us to see each other
again," said Master Yun-yen.
 "It will be very hard for us not to see each other again," answered
Liang-chieh. "After you have passed away, how can I answer someone if he
wants me to describe what you were like?"
 "You just say to him, 'This is!'" Yun-yen replied. Liang-chieh kept
silent for a while. Then Yun-yen said to him, "You must be very careful,
as you are carrying this great thing."


There is the great thing and the little thing, said Nikuko. The great
thing, 'This is not!,' but the little thing is viral, lodged in my brain,
turning departure always already into a sadness like the German horses who
killed themselves out of depression, or so I have heard.

When is a life not a life of departures? When is there salutation and the
new and raw beginnings of a wonderful life? When will I see the beautiful
handshaking lead towards loving fruition? When will I settle, no longer
existing, but living and dwelling in a place I call my own?

When will I leave the Net forever, when will I find my home page a place
of love and texts?

When will I achieve enlightenment, with this virus in my brain?


________________________________________________________________________


Nikuko becomes Jealous of Julia-Timothy-Chat


Nikuko cruising the Net finds the following and logs it down, down down.
Nikuko cruising the Net wonders, there is talk all over the world like
this, roaring through the wires, these snatches, maybe you can think of
them as blouses or flies unbuttoned, just a peek inside, desiring taking
the long way around. Or a bit of aggression or the promise of a bed for
the night, or arms around one for an hour, just an hour, that is all I
would beg of you. So what is the point if not that it's pointless, not
filling, but fulfilling the virtual subject, failing the real Nikuko, lost
in this darkness, here and me, me me, reading his or her body in the midst
of tang and snocones and sweet goodbyes?

Because you can see that anyone and everywhere will speak, if not the
same, along the lines of interpenetrating chat, working through the other
back towards some sort of recognition of the self. It's a fix. It's a cool
fix. I'd like some drugs to fix me. I'm desperate for drugs to fix me. I
wish I had a head to be fixed. I'd fix the drugs on the head and I'd be
ok. I'd be ok and I would be happy. I wish I, Nikuko, could place myself
inside of, say, Julia or timothy (I'd go in write through the slit!); I
would be happy, I would be out of here: I would live forever! I'd really
be very happy!

Now you may read what I logged below or you may not because you already
know exactly what it will say!

sweetener tasted like sugar as much as they did *<SusieBravo>: like $5...
the clubs made a killing (serving afterhours that is) *<Florida>: since
I'm poor, I use fizzies as a placebo for alka seltzer when I'm sick.

from eating pop rocks with 7up? *<Florida>: pop rocks.. yum!
*<SusieBravo>: pop rocks are people like Maddonna... she is Pop then hits
the Rocks *<georgette>: dang....how come we don't get any of the good
stuff down here... *<Lul>: So whos this stripper? *<hard drive>: Lul you
live a seltered life *<SusieBravo>: lol Lul *<§ Julia §>: might be
Junk...remember something like that *<georgette>: hahaha i know voodoo...
;-)  *<Lul>: Maybe I have a calling or something ... I dont know ...
*<SusieBravo>: maybe *<Lul>: wwooooo. I doubt it but maybe on the
weekends. heh *<Lul>: The Full Monty!  heheheh *<SusieBravo>: well bedtime

garooovey *<georgette>: smooches1 *<Lul>: 113 degrees today *<§ Julia §>:
((:  <Pooooooof> :)) *<Lul>: could have cooked breakfast on the sidewalk

I would be a niter. I would retire from the machine. Perhaps I have a
virus in my brain. I think I have a virus in my brain. (I'll fix the drug
on my head. I'll look through its slit!) I think it reproduces when I type
this when Alan lets lets lets lets me go go. I think it makes me hot hot
hot. I think I would be real real real.

Subject: the subject of what might be effaced in relation to protocols or 
    a dense alterity given its due - this happens when handshaking             
    gets taken for granted, when exhaustion takes over,              when
    existence itself appears to tremble,              outside of any
    subjectivity ...

  murmuring   against all asides   what is broken by you as _this_ is broken
  by you,   what you bring together as _this_ is sutured against the will,
  the cut, the wound, the miracle of flesh   bound by forgotten space   which
  tells you nothing more   than this is _it_ (fwd)

Core Dump

{k:28} ls -la core
core not found

it's the middle of the night, i'm lying directly under nikuko, looking for
a core dump. i try rooting around, nothing. there's less and less core.
the core's the heart of nikuko; it comes out her hole and into me. it
keeps me awake at night. it keeps me awake now in the middle of the night.

a core appears when a program crashes. it's called a core dump because
it's fast processing giving you an account of what happens if you know how
to read it. it can be huge. the core part of the phrase is from the old
days when almost microscopic magnets were used for memory storage. they
were called cores. they were donut-shaped with wires running through the
holes. the core dump took out the fossilized remains of the crash. then
programs made it readable. a core dump is literal coprolithic, shit that's
stopped processing, hardened. coprolites are read for their animal and
vegetable content; you can tell what the animal was eating maybe millions
of years ago. dumps contain memories of working hungered bodies.

i'd eat your core dump, nikuko, your shit falling into my open mouth. i'd
eat your memory, your birth, expansion of your body all through the wires,
around the magnets drawing you to me. i'd become full of memory, yours and
mine, and isn't that the case now, when i type late into the night, always
already full of you, watching your breasts burst through my chest, your
fingers through my fingers, taking control of the keyboard, forcing me to
write these truths?

i'm your animal animal animal

Some Europe


Why do the French, for example, Julia Kristeva and the chatterings asso-
ciated with the chora and ruptures, or Jean-Jacques Lecercle and delirium,
then take Gilles Deleuze on non-sense or Catherine Clement on rapture, or
the opening of Anti-Oedipus or practically the w/hole of Libidinal Econo-
my, then there's the latent hysteria in The Story of the Eye, I mean why
do the French - and this becomes something for the English or the Ameri-
cans - some sort of escape into the preconception of depth where no one
treads - there's always the unconscious - good etiquette keeps it down as
does the internal evidence of the text - for example foreclosing or fire-
walls around what constitutes sense - reading the endless descriptions in
P.D. James for example - there is a sort of rectitude of class everywhere
present in this thinking and I'd say even in for example the performative
which becomes clear-cut and no wonder everyone gets upset with Derrida
spilling ink all over the margins; of course Huntington's been taken apart
for his climatological theories of civilization, so we've got to look
elsewhere as France (yes, Kristeva and Derrida only half-way in and out,
and for that matter let's not forget Lacan's choratic behaviors on and off
the text) might be the testicle of Spain but there the image rummages
around and comes to an end - it's not as if there's the necessity for a
sudden bursting-forth like you get, maybe in Lautreamont, Rimbaud as well,
but you don't get in Japan and France isn't simply that regimented
although regimented indeed - so why there, language-control-subversion
_from the lowest levels_ in the form of a conspiracy I don't know - but
these _chatterings_ (let's not forget feminin ecriture, Irigaray, Wittig,
Cixous, or what might pass for masculin ecriture, Barthes, Sollers for
two, ever read his Women? I did for the in-sites) are everywhere, taking
apart foundations or what might pass for them (let's not forget however
Rene Thom, the Bourbaki, even Benoit Mandlebrot on the other side of the
coin, all these mother-structures appearing - I'd put Pierre Duhem's
analysis somewhere in the middle of all this) - you've got cooling ponds
on the surface with their ordered ciliated enfoldings of structured
shorelines and down deep, Leviathans breaking out (look at Roustang or
Clement Rosset, now we're talking) or shuttling around the surface (then
there's the German analyses of classical geometric surfaces and their
ur-structures, think of Klein, although there are Manning and Sommerville
for n-dimensional stuff, not to mention Coxeter) - one might wonder about
the flaneur tradition (situationism, Baudelaire, Beau Brummel) as far as
that goes, the whole francophonic enterprise as it were, one great derive
- look at Balzac and one couldn't leave out, in the entirety across the
board, Rabelais - or the Flaubert of Saint Anthony or Salome - from which
all sorts of disturbances erupt - I prefer Bouvard and Pecuchet myself -
it's subtler there, the choratic breaking out as ripples across the cool-
ing ponds, especially in the received notions section of the book - one
might place, especially in regard to derive, the vagabonding of Villon
naturally enough - as if nature were artifice vis-a-vis Mallarme (not to
mention the Quebecois Gaston Miron, which opens up all sorts of possibil-
ities - Nicole Brossard's ecriture feminin, Hubert Acquin's Robbe-Grillet
coupled with frisson and anti-colonialism, Paul Chamberland's eruption,
Marie Claire-Blais' burning homes, flamed desires) - as Victor Beaulieu
might point out the Catholicisms erupting as well (look at Bataille, Lei-
ris once again, no wait, Verlaine), even sciences' chatterings in the
guise of Michel Serres (not to mention Foucault somewhere hungering about
the Bourbaki if I had my way about it) - or Sartre's Being and Nothingness
finishing off with slimy holes, you get the picture (all those theories of
representation, say Christian Metz) - broken by Baudrillard turning rup-
ture into rapture into and out of fine art - it's a big swirl, it has no
beginning and no end, it just goes round and round and doesn't escape the
borders of the continent - oh yes, it's been incontinent - there have been
missives, missions, missionaries - unceasing flooding of lapped shores
world-wide - Celine would pause at one or another point here - place three
little dots - _all_ those shores - I'll refuse to do it - it's been an
industry (don't forget for a second the analyses of Pierre Bourdieu, Regis
Debray) - it turns in on itself - it implodes - a precession of thinking
simulacra - (actants maybe in Greimas, sad and fallen leaves and leavings
in Violet Leduc) - world-wide influence (Sartre and de Beauvoir beaver to
his mister, Levi-Strauss' discontent with structure turned music, telling
his way through the saying of culture in spite of everything or Piaget
bringing it back in essai de logique operatoire) - one's got to give cre-
dit to rapture still (Michel Tournier doing to Robinson Crusoe or The
Ogre) - just a moment, the phone's ringing (Pierre Levy on the other end
of the line) (extending outward like hermaphroditic pubic hair) (curling
around Sarduy as everyone comes to Paris) (drugged by Michaux) (killed by
Artaud) just a moment, the bell's ringing (running down the flow) (someone
I don't know)

Slipping Through the Cracks


Orientation from Herodotus II, 36: "When they write or calculate, instead
of going, like the Greeks, from left to right, they move their hand from
right to left; and they insist, notwithstanding, that it is they who go to
the right and the Greeks who go to the left."

Quotes from Henry George Fischer, The Orientation of Hieroglyphs, Part I.
Reversals, Egyptian Studies II, The Metropolitan Museum of Art:

Of Nefertiti: "Even in the Karnak scenes where she alone worships the Aten
her name is invariably preceded by a reference to Akhenatan in her title
[fig.] 'great wife of the king, whom he loves.' And much more frequently,
her cartouche follows two of his, which are in turn confronted by the
names of Aten [...]. Thus the reversal in her cartouche may indicate that
her husband is the source of her contact with the god. There is, in this
relationship, something of the Miltonian concept: 'Hee for God only, shee
for God in him,' although they shared 'Thir Orisons, each Morning duly
paid.'"

"As shown by his gesture of invocation, the king himself pronounces the
offering formula in front of him, all of which is oriented as he is, ex-
cept for the name of the divine recipient."

"Quite possibly, in view of the adjacent juxtaposition displayed by the
adjacent caption, 'singing to the harp,' the missing object of the prepo-
sition was thought to be supplied by the opposed representation of danc-
ing, with the figures facing left."

"Among the repertory of hieroglyphs in common use, as represented in
Gardiner's Sign List, there are a few exceptions to the usual orientation
- exceptions, moreover, for which no explanation has been offered. The
most perplexing of these are the inverted staff, the sail that is blown
backwards, the reversed boat [...]." [hieroglyphs and references omitted]

What are signs, that they may be stayed upon the head, faced within the
mirror, transformed from outside-in, absolved from inside-out? What is the
materiality of the sign so lost and constituted in these forms, where <
and > are not oppositions but independent, assigned different and variant
encodings? One might reference calligraphy in general, the running style
of kanji, and see Jan Assmann's Ancient Egypt and the Materiality of the
Sign, in Materialities of Communication (eds. Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht and K.
Ludwig Pfeiffer).

[I come towards you. I approach you. I leave by the moon. I go from the
cave. The world goes with me. Your sight bedazzles me. How can I return
when your sight is imprinted on mine, eye to eye?]

What is the history of the sign and token, from Sumerian tabulations and
clay impresses - through the pressure of edged reeds, rock incisions,
brush and penstrokes? I've spoken repeatedly about these elements; one
might also consider a _wavering hieroglyphic_ in which each and every sign
might face one or another direction, in relation to portent, to the divin-
atio at work as the superstructure breaks loose from the world, recuper-
ates the word as construct of the gods.

"In two Old Kingdom tomb chapels, where the owner of a tomb addresses mem-
bers of his family in order to give them testamentary instructions, the
orientation of his statement is reversed, along with the words that intro-
duce the statement."

Perhaps you break through the lines; I _must_ face you, regardless of the
consequences, regarding your mien, in due regard for your truth in its
place, breaking down the symbolic, transforming it into a certain surplus.

I have no regard for the orientation. I'm always facing you in my dreams.
Making love face to face. Watching. Looking.

Being observed.

"Instead of turning an entire statement around, together with the words
introducing it, the scribes of the Old Kingdom sometimes applied the re-
versal solely to the introductory word [...] 'he says,' following the
speaker's titles and name, in order to point up the fact that the
following words were a direct quotation."

Perhaps I dream your breath, hear your voice coming from the left or
right or within me, an insistence toppling even the vacuity of avatars,
returning your flesh across the queendoms of distributed networks. You
speak so softly, I bend towards you, my ear against your belly. What is
heard in the smooth convexity of spheres, planets, earths.

"Old Kingdom lists of offerings (from Dynasty III onward) are very common-
ly turned so that the hieroglyphs address the person for whom they are in-
tended."

"Here the reversal may have been intended to stress the roundabout orien-
tation of a river that flows south instead of north, as the Nile does."

"Writings of _`kprt_ 'entering and coming forth.'"

Conceivably I do not know whether I am coming or going, towards or away
from you; my hand trembles, the brush goes every whichaway across the
parchment, the signs _spill._ Perhaps I enter you, come forth through a
portal whose destination remains unknown; I am faced left, right, or in-
verted, I lose my way, Virgil nowhere to be found.

"The first two dynasties provide evidence for all three of the basic situ-
ations requiring reversals - confrontation, symmetry, and concordance -
including several uses of hieroglyphic confrontations that are frequent in
later periods, notably the opposition of various elements of the royal
protocol and the opposition of the names of a divinity and of a king."

Facing you, I face myself; joining you, I join myself; becoming you, I no
longer separate such residues, things, stains and processes. Language
wrapping allowing all entering. Direction from the sphere.

The saddest apparent cutback at san.com. The shell accounts become weaker
and weaker. Now, there's no time or place for one-to-one conversation. Now
it's all windows, clicking, mice running all over the place, banners, beta
updates, passwords, cookies, spam.

"_talk_ is enjoyable, if trivial, once you've worked out the kinks. It's
difficult, for example, to handle pauses in a conversation. Without verbal
cues or physical gestures, you don't really know whether you're supposed
to say something or whether your correspondent is simply gathering her
thoughts before continuing. Then too, there's the question of productiv-
ity. You find after a while that simultaneous typing doesn't produce a
very high information flow; you can ratchet up the content by ten or so if
you simply pick up the phone and call this person." (Gilster, The Internet
Navigator, first edition.)

But talk (and ytalk, the later version) works at a distance; it's bare-
bones and appears bare-body; there is no advertising; you can go in and
out of the shell with ytalk, and so forth. The receiver types below the
sender. As in ICQ and other like-minded chats, you see the letters as they
are being entered; the result is the appearance of virtual bodies/spaces
on your screen. It is extraordinarily intense for net sex, and years ago,
Kim McGlynn and I did a number of pieces using and logging the format for
a series of texts dealing with psychosis and hysteric bodies/fluxes across
the screen, barely in and out of control.

It is bare-bones, and there is no advertising, no menu visible; the
monitor screen is divided by a dotted line which may or may not contain
the recipient's address. And that is all you see. And the rest is yours
and the person with whom you are writing, talking. You can write together,
simultaneously, as if over one another, interspersing one another. With
fixed-width courier fonts, it all appears natural, letters bursting out,
not with devices, but with the intensity of content unraveling. You
unravel each other.

I won't be sad. I'll put your picture on the screen. I'll put everyone's
picture on the screen. I'll move my mouse around the pad. I'll move the
cursor around an infinity of bodies. Supine or leaning back, here, where
you are not, I'll move the mouse across my body, in the flesh, the flesh
in the flesh, mouse into cursor onto you. And I'll map my body onto yours.
And I'll map my nipples onto yours. And I'll map my cock onto your cunt.
I'll map my eyes onto your eyes. I'll map my mouth onto your mouth, my
arms into yours, my legs into yours, my asshole, yours. And neither of us
will have to say a thing; neither of us need never speak again.

The Return of Nikuko in an Expanding Universe


A Transmission of Jennifer, by Julu, Buried Beneath the Ground

Nikuko returns to gol.com (Japan) only to find 
/var/log/nonexistent.notused. 

{k:7} cd nonexistent.notused
{k:8} ls
ls: .: Permission denied
{k:9} ls -la
ls: .: Permission denied
 
Nikuko wants to be used. Her function is usage. She is defined by her
function. Darling Nikuko. Nikuko herself uses Nikuko. Nikuko-function
uses Nikuko-Function. Okagami, Great Mirror. Self-reflexive function:
absorption: xx = x. x _always goes for_ x.
 
{k:10} rm Nikuko
remove Nikuko? y
{k:11} Get on with it.

The text here splays, dissolves. That is, arousal guarantees there's no
longer a body. But it's a sign to someone else, that's for sure. So who
are you? The text's supine, no one else is. Who would it be? Who would 
use the name _Nikuko?_ I'd say no one would use the name. I'd say she's
hardly removed; there's been too much talk about /dev/nul, the device at
the end of the world, lately. 

Because - and Jennifer has been musing this for a long time now - once
there's sufficient expansion of the universe, there's no longer memory. It
won't do to say even now, _this happened, how beautiful this was._ It
won't do to harbor these texts. Annihilation as an operation won't exist
either. Nothing will exist and not exist, but this is no comfort to the
ch'an; it's a bar of thinking and non-thinking. It's impossible to think
this through or to think through this.

What you're thinking through just now is the memory of the sign. And it
fills your body. To the breaking-point.

Even now, depressed and thinking of death, the text begins to meander,
waver, lose its moorings. But it's still remembered by you. But it won't
be in the future, say "far future," you can say it. Say it before the
screen, prostrated as such. Remember the future anterior, remember it's
always already a memory. But a memory of the sign.

(You won't even know what you're missing. Jennifer won't let you see her
anymore. Not without her clothes!)

Which is none at all. I can't tell you how nonexistent that is. And to
what extent notused.

I can't tell you anything, Julu, buried beneath the ground.

What I might have Said


"Language is such a marvelous and fruitful secret - because when someone
speaks merely for the sake of speaking, he utters the most splendid, most
original truths. But if he wants to speak about something definite, cap-
ricious language makes him say the most ridiculous and confused stuff.
This is also the cause of the hatred that so many serious people feel to-
ward language. They notice its mischief, but not the fact that the chat-
tering they scorn is the infinitely serious aspect of language. If one
could only make people understand that it is the same with language as
with mathematical formulae. These constitute a world of their own. They
play only with themselves, express nothing but their own marvelous nature,
and just for this reason they are so expressive - just for this reason the
strange play of relations between things is mirrored in them. Only through
their freedom are they elements of nature and only in their free movements
does the world soul manifest itself in them and make them a sensitive
measure and ground plan of things." (From Novalis, Philosophical Writings,
ed. Margaret Mahony Stoljar.)

So you're saying, backing it up with this quote, that all that Jennifer-
Julu-Nikuko chattering and running haywire around protocols and internets
and operating systems, is actually the measuring of the world, that the
approach should move from psychoanalytics to mensuration. I'm saying it's
a way of avoiding death, just like chattering, rumor, innuendo, gossip, is
a continual adjusting of the world. Not avoiding death exactly, but avoid-
ing the thinking-through of death, its looming presence - relegating it
into the background. Talk about grandparents, parents, children, grand-
children, situating oneself in the line of who did what with whom and
when, yes, exactly. Not the lineage, though, not the formal ordering of
generations and genealogies, but the small-talk, the idle talk - it's the
very speaking of things. It's the making-erasing-making of grounds over
and over again, say, did you see Sam over there? I can't believe he's with
that woman again. Not after what they did to each other. Talk about loss
of control.

They'd talk about loss of control for the next ten minutes. When's the
last time you heard from her? There was that phonecall in the middle of
the night. Who's middle? Who's night? The world begins to pucker like
chapped fingers or lip pouts. "Nothing is more Romantic than what we usu-
ally call world and destiny. We live in a colossal novel (writ _large_ and
_small_)." (ibid.) But "the strange play of relations among things" - now
we might tend to see the relations over the things, dominant relations.
Not an ordering or ranking of relations, but handshakings and communali-
ties in the world or worlding. Adjustings, jostlings. Precisely what might
be the gossip or the return to the daytime television show. It's got its
inroads into the evening hours as well, look at Beverly Hills 90210. None
are different as, it's not what I'd call a leveling, but a dispersion of
the local. It's on the level of the local (writ _large_ and _small_) that
we can get on with things. Literally with things, those of our creation. A
hurricane or a tornado isn't a thing. One might call it a force of nature.
It's all in the movement and we've got to apply movements to ourselves as
well. Not that there isn't geopolitics as well, enormous crimes, once we
decide what constitutes a crime. I've heard rumors of smashed bodies,
mutilated women, men, children. Even the order's got an ideology, informal
as it is. Should I have said men, women, children? Should children come
first as in, our children are our future? What a capitulation; we're our
future, through and through. When the eye closes, the I closes. But chat-
tering wards off the eye.

I've always seen the self as a coagulation or temporary stasis, meaning it
seems that way. Think of the world soul as something moving, feeling its
way through each of it. We have our own, the mensuration of the ground
plan. Just like the rumor-speaker, we're capable of being totally trans-
parent. "Humanity is the higher meaning of our planet, the nerve that con-
nects this part of it with the upper world, the eye it raises to heaven"
(ibid.) I'd say that humanity is the _only_ meaning, and meaning is the
fruit of the human, hungering. Look how chatter disseminates! We might
think no farther than the talk-children of talk-parents! Our tiny anec-
dotes sent naked into the world! Look at them! Why last night on my street
a policecar pulled another over. There was a young man with gang colors
taken out. There was an officer with a gun pointed straight at him. There
were other backup officers. I took four photographs, the officer, the gun,
the young man, the car, the street. I only once had a gun pulled on me and
in the heat of the moment I wasn't sure it was a gun. But I've been fired
at, just haven't seen their weapons. And knives pulled quite a few times.
It didn't mean anything, my death would have joined the crew. You know
what I mean. It's a beautiful fall out; I remember crisp air like this in
Providence, living on the hill with June. I thought, the light is silver,
I've never seen such light. It came as a _revelation._

Dispersions


[The following are notes towards a concept - research that I hope to pur-
sue in the future.]

If simulacra represent the imaginaries of the symbolic, emissions the spew
of the symbolic without source or destination, the nomadic a form of mean-
dering, and the network a meshing which may or may not possess arrows and
nodes - we might call a dispersion that which implies local sites that may
or may not be in flux, connected or disconnected, in relation to a corpor-
ate imaginary which may or may not be real. Dispersions of Sony Walkmen,
computer pets, cellular, PDAs, beepers - some of these online, some off-
line - some of these live online - some, like Eudora, downloading/upload-
ing in spurts - these are part of a new social which extends beyond the
urban landscape, ignores socio-political boundaries, and may or may not be
connected to a matrix or unary node. Dispersions recreate the body in the
home, home in the body - there are also CuSeeMe, ICQ, other chats, and the
like. Some like webchats are often surrounded by banner ads; some, like
any MOO or email list, are connected to unary and central nodes. Some,
like IRC or news-groups, have dispersed nodes and accessibilities.

Dispersions are not simulacra; they exist among hardwares, softwares, wet-
wares. They're not emissions; they're often traceable, and they're almost
always interactive. They're not nomadicisms; they wander only where the
home or body wanders. And they may or may not be networked. I tend to
think of them as part-objects or conglomerations - there are protocols and
handshakings involved - in other words, formal filters and effects. And
they are "glued" to the real/virtual subject - through earphones, fingers,
psychoanalytical and/or psychological processes.

The subject as a coagulation extends within and without dispersions -
there are few clear boundaries. With Walkmen, she might inhabit a sound-
world. With email lists, he might inhabit a virtual community. Inhabita-
tion is no longer by virtue of place, but by addressing - direct or indi-
rect, dynamic or static.

These extensions are complicated by hackings, issues of intellectual pro-
perties and sampling, as well as realignments of group and neighborhoods,
etc. Both politics and war are qualitatively different, the latter also
operating under the potential of viral, bacterial, plutonium, nerve gas
and information (war) dispersions, all useful for potential mass destruc-
tion. Politics "suffers" from information overload, from high-speed emis-
sions (see the article on the Y2K newsgroup in the current Sci. Am.), from
anomic responses. Culture becomes localized on one hand and absolutist on
the other (manifesto-culture). Desire and _frisson_ chatter across bord-
ers; transgression becomes normative, no longer laden with boundary main-
tenance. Kristeva's 'borderline personality' as the disorder of our time
also figures in here - as do the discussions about the very existence of
IAD (internet addiction disorder).

At the moment, I have no conclusions; I'm not proposing a model or strat-
egy. It's difficult to differentiate among splayed processes or operations
(emission, etc.) - these existing (and perhaps constituting) various reals
as well. Dispersion, as a formal or informal model, seems promising, and
hopefully not just another piece of jargon.

{k:16} last sondheim > online; head online
sondheim  ttypc    sondheim.dialup. Wed Sep 16 00:09   still logged in
sondheim  ttyp6    ts3.nyc.access.n Tue Sep 15 21:37 - 22:30  (00:52)
sondheim  ttyr1    sondheim.dialup. Tue Sep 15 20:14 - 20:14  (00:00)

The above lists my connections from around 8:14 earlier this evening, 
until now this morning (around 12:53). Note I am listed as on from 12:09.

But this isn't the case. The connection suddenly gave out; the telnet
should have died at that point. When I reconnected (to my permanent IP
address), the telnet was still open.

In other words, I was on and off, and while I was off, the telnet process
remained active. It shouldn't have. There was more than enough time for
it to be killed. I was off for a full minute, trying to figure out what
had happened; this was around 12:45 am.

So when I came back on, I didn't have to log in at the telnet; it was
running. I logged in to the IP, my telnet application was open, and I was
back into my account.

The problem is, this way, telnet might have provided a gateway for someone
else into my account. See, you used to be able to flood an ISP, then when
people just cut the connection without logging out (which is what happened
with me), other people could jam into the open connections. The flooding
was necessary to slow everything up - people got irritated, just closed
down the computers without shutting down the processes. Dangerous to do. 

Here's a reverse instance - years ago I was bounced off in a somewhat
similar fashion; when I came back on - it was through dialup and I found
myself online without being asked for a login name or password - I was in
someone else's account. I did ytalk from that account. I could have caused
a lot of trouble. I could have read his mail. I was literally in someone
else's shell. I was that someone. To all extents and purposes.

I was not an avatar. I did not constitute the other; I was in fact con-
stituted by the other, speaking as other. I found myself in a chat under
someone else's name. It was immediate. The chat was "about" Ann Rand. I
found I had just said something about a screwdriver. After a few minutes I
logged off.

Now tonight I come in under my own name; however, after coming in as oth-
er, returning as myself, or my constituted self, without the customary
telent login and password, has an equal degree of the uncanny about it.
Who do I trust here, when I can no longer figure my own entrances and
exits? Who is writing this?

- Jennifer
