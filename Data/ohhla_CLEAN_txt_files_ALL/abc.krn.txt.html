Allah, yo yo yo yo
98 styles, 2000 styles, K-Rino, Ultimate, flow
Is my homies in the house (hell yeah)
Is my homies in the house (hell yeah)
All the hustlas in the house
All the sistas in the house
All the playas in the house

A is for the ammo
B is for the blood
C is for them crazy brothas shootin at the club
D is for the dope game
E is for the end
F is for the foo that'll fuck over his friend
G is for the gangstas
H is for the hood
I means I'm ignorant, but thinkin it's all good
J is for them jackas
K is for the kill
L is for the layed out victims of the steel
M is for the money
N I need it fast
O is what you say, when them bullets hit yo ass
P is for the pimps
Q is for the queens
R is for the rims on your ride when it's clean
S is for that South Park
T is for the Trae
U better run when them killas come your way
V is for my victim
W is wake
X marks the spot on whatever I'ma take
Y is for these youngstas
Z cuz it's a zoo
God kill America, the red, white, and blue
It's like that

Now what you know about that?
K is causin the pain, with the blood and rain
It's like that

Is my homies in the house
Is my homies in the house (hell yeah)
All the hustlas in the house
All the sistas in the house
All the playas in the house</pre>
