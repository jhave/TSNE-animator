[Verse 1 - Mac Dre]
Backwoods got me congested ain't rested in two days
I'm gettin' paid been on niggaz head like toupees
I'm a thug cause rob the blood out you gays
A cutthroat nigga, bitch I scam you if you daze
From school days I blew bays got ripped and fucked up
In new jays on two ways I scritched and scratched up
I beat that batch up when I found out she lyin'
Who she think I am, saving private Ryan

[Verse 2 - Andre Nickatina]
I make ya town move just by walking on ya block
Take the keys to ya city but I still pick the lock
Buy a car and a glock, put the cash in my socks
Flip the beat in the trunk so ya hear the shit knock
To hell with the law, the freeway's mines
So is yo freak radios and Alpines
Coke with a little bit of cherry lemon lime
Ya think of me ya think of big money everytime
Candy coat shine like the trigger of a nine
Orca was a whale but Pisces is the sign

[Verse 3 - Mac Dre]
I got split personalities, I'm bi-polar
You might see me with my Italian stallion or my chola
Rap rock and rolla, I'm dope as yola
If you don't pimp her, I might like Dola
I'm riding in a big boat like Noah
Wid two women of each races, boy I control a
A whole hoe stable I'm a mack and I'm ready
No dough hoe dead it, that's right I said it

[Verse 4 - Andre Nickatina]
I dream of dollar bills like my Caddy steering wheel
I'm not a chil pill freak do what you will
Heart ticking like a time bomb eating spicy crimes
Man it's the god of Khan check it baby right or wrong
Can look but don't stare it's the crime rhyme king
Wid braids like a juvenile Khan nahmean?
Wid Bruce Springstein in my Anchor blue jeans
Oh yeh I'm in ya city man what's up with the weed
Man call all the Gs, and tell 'em all freeze
Andre Nickatina sayin' nigga what you need
Hit the corna so narrow in a fly blue Camero
A sparrow dodge a arrow but not a double barrel

[Verse 5 - Mac Dre]
We in a seven series beama it's me and Nickatina
Ready to sexual harrass a bitch like Martin did Gena
Committin' felonies and hella misdemeanours
A dog in the yard where the grass is hella greener
Rap singer, pimp done slapped Tina
I mack nina from black to latina
Clean as Noxema quick to pop the nina
Got the money from the broad as soon as I seen her
Willamina, Tina and Trina got dicked by the bay on a burgen' Marina
Don't mean to point the finger but uh
She got pancake syrup and butter

[Verse 6 - Andre Nickatina]
Man the way I smoke weed it's like death of a genius
Reappear roll up rise like a phoenix
This is not a remix, Nino Felix
Put it in a capsule seal it deal it
How you want it Nicky baby four times five
A quarter ounce of weed and some cherry pot fries
Excuse me if I'm greedy cause I'm caught up in the lust
I'd lie if you want but I'm a tiger you can trust
Cause I'm on Fillmoe in a white Valor suit
In a blue Kangol, in my Wu-Tang boots
Wid a back like a cobra cursed by the mail
My manicured nails touch a triple beam scale
Baby is a athlete, body like a star
Ya talking rieal bad freak meet me by the car</pre>
