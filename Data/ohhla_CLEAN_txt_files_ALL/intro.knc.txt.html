[Old Leroy &amp; Nelson Brown talking]

[Knoc-Turn'Al]
Do you have any idea what I'm about to do to the rap game
Ain't shit changed, I'ma do my thang
If you know hustle game don't stop
It ain't about fame, it ain't about glory
It's about niggaz grindin' on the block
Ain't shit changed, I'ma do my thang
If you know hustle game don't stop
It ain't about fame, it ain't about glory
It's about niggaz grindin' on the block

[Old Leroy talking]

[Knoc-Turn'Al]

Nate Dogg, Dr.Dre, Snoop Dogg
LA Confidential is definetaly in the motherfuckin house
