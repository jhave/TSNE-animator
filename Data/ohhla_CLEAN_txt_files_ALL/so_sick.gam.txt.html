[Intro]
Uhh
Yeah~! This how we do this
+Sick Boi+
Gonna show y'all how I does
Childish, Gambino
Gambino, on the real
Let's do it

[Childish Gambino]
Girl show your wobble off
I'm not Queen Latifah but I +Set It Off+
I'm lookin like a tight rainbow, Kangols, got my blue ruse
Lookin like candy so I'm goody two-shoes
Call me +Spruce Goose+ cause my clothes so fly
I'm not Howard Hughes, but I'm not a sane guy
I'm a +Big Mac+, you just a small fry
Tryin so hard to get that swagger like mine
And got them steps off my head, I guess my mind wanders
Try to emulate my +Lifestyle+ like condoms
I'm fly on the mic, I'm fly as a DJ
I keep a thick chick on +The Wire+ like +Wee-Bey+
He say, she say that I so handsome
And Flay keep away from this girl like Ransom
Sorry that your girl all Europe like Tyler
You know him from the South, I stay dirty like Tyler

[Chorus: repeat 8X]
So sick with it that they call me ebola

[Childish Gambino]
My boombox handy, blastin that stank
You can Marcus like Quimby, they call me the Tank
Cause nobody can touch me, I'm fire with a fade
I ate a La-Z-Boy but I'm always gettin laid
I'm jack of all trades, I can do no wrong
I'm make a huge fart and it style like a song
I talk jibber jabber and it comes out words
I shit out cavities, you flossin my turds
I don't like ice; a little bit of gold and them Nikes
The Cool Kids understand my plight
I'm a simple Sam - I'm always thick with it
cause that's who I am - I keep that shit slick
like my name was Pam - and even if I did it
I'd be the flyest nigga drivin 'round in a Civic
And for those who didn't get it, you should play it back
I'm sick like a dog on crack, f'real

[Chorus]</pre>
