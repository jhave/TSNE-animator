(*talking*)
Balling is a habit over here, at Paid In Full
Want you to know that, g'yeah

[Hook - 2x]
Balling is a habit like Jordan, Bird and Magic
My life is fantastic, maculant extravagent
Got a high rise and a bachelor pad, rims tumble like acrobats
A buck sixty where the dash is at, platinum card no maxing that

[50/50 Twin]
Balling is a habit baby
Chinchilla, makes my jackets baby
I don't wanna get cash, from rapping crazy
I'm gutter I grind, stop acting crazy
Capping on wax, ain't really me
Ten G's a day, that's a brilliant week
Big faces breeder thee
Caugh nine packs, I sneeze a ki
Roll through Panama, floss the Benz
Wipe my Timberland's, off with ten's
50/50, the Lil' Twin
Leave the rap game, with a flawless win
Take a flight, in a G-4-7
Spend the night, in a East Coast setting
I'm so hot dog, I need more relish
2004, watch B.C. fetish

[Paul Wall]
When my car, is changing speed
I'm like Tarzan, swanging through trees
It's so much, ice in my mouth
When I take a deep breath, I get brain freeze
Millionaires wanna hang with me
R&amp;B girls keep singing to me
The FEDs think, I'm exchanging ki's
Everyday new car, I'm exchanging keys
Boys riding in 7-45's, that was cool last year
But I'm V-12 in a 7-60, Kenyon passing me beer
I step in the club cameras flashing, girls wanna take my pic
Which girls am I taking home, I can take my pick
50/50 in fur coats, so please no finger prints on his mink
I tip the bar tender more money, than I spend on the drinks
Lil' mama keep skipping and wink, she give me glances
I'ma make a move, on them sexual advances
And by the end of the night, I can garuntee I'ma be up in them panties
I ain't never slept in the same room, twice in my house
Frosty the Snowman can build a house, with the ice in my mouth
I got more diamonds than South Africa, flawless ice is immaculate
I'm flipping the game like a spatula, now these girls ex-boyfriends mad at us

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
No spending ends, in gentlemen's
Strip clubs, it's just for spinning rims
I want it now, I get it then
Cop it drop it, cop it again
Not him again, not Bennegan's
Treat a slut for what, not fin to spend
For bitter Gin, and dinner when
I can get up in, her little friend
Rewind, back to fact that you
Get attached, to the bachelor
Cause the fact, that I captured the
Green back, she unstrapping her
Bra strap, getting back in the
Jacuzzi, cause of my macking the
Water gun'll be splashing for
The girl that hops in, right after her
Riding mayn, in a Lac with the
T.V. screens, in the back of the
Seat, Ro got strack and uh
Strapped with him, and that's because
The same person, that's dapping you
Be the same, thinking bout jacking you
Stack, is what the girl asking for
My ad-libs, is gon laugh at her (ha-ha-ha)
Koopa got you Koopa will spot you, yeah right
All she gon see, is my tail lights
And choke on the smoke, from my tail pipe
Houton Texas, endacedar
Purple stuff, if that's lavendar
Major labels, that's not what I'm asking for
Hang up the phone, I'll get back with you
