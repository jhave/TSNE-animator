This is the fuckin shit I be talkin about
Half rappin' ass mothafuckers
You think it's a game?  You think it's a fuckin GAME?
Come on, uh, uh, uh
Come on, uh, uh
What'cha really want
What'cha really want, what
D-M-X, uh, uh
Come on, Ryde or die

Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo
What's my name?  DMX and I be the best
You see the rest they lookin like they need a rest
One more time, I'mma spit at you some shit
That's gon get at you be fuckin with your mind, stop talkin shit
Cuz you out there runnin' your mouth
And really don't know who you fuckin with
Here we go again
How many times do I have to tell you rap niggas?
I have no friends you still actin up
Runnin around here like some brand new pussy that's about to get fucked
The game don't stop, I'm still gettin down for whatever
Whenever that's why my shit is hot, can't keep it real
Now, some of us do but most of us don't that's just how a nigga feel
I shed blood, for my people that'll keep you lookin see-through
Whenever you try to creep through

[CHORUS] x2
D-M-X
If you want it we got it
Come and get it nigga we wit it
All you gotta do is set it baby
Ryde or die
What'cha niggas want, uh, uh
What'cha niggas want

You still playin games
You gon think it's a joke until they no longer remember your name
That's how we do em
Make cowards disappear into thin air by puttin shit through em
Never comin' back
Last time you saw that nigga is the last time you'll see that nigga 
(alright)
No more deaths
Cuz in a minute you gonna have grandma bein the only family member left
Bust my gun
If I gots to kill a nigga but I'm always down for the one on one
Dog for life
We gon get to the bottom of this shit if it takes all night
Stop drop
Open up shop (what?)
Fake up-north niggas screamin' for the cops
Ryde or die
What that mean is that a tell a nigga bye-bye and pop him in his right eye

[CHORUS] x2

Look at all these off brand niggas
Runnin' around yappin' about they be holdin figgas as big as Jigga's
That's that bullshit
Hope they know that around me talkin' about what you got will get you hit
I'm not a nice person
I mean I'd smack the shit out you twice dog and that's before I start 
cursin'
I stay flippin'
One minute I'm cool, the next minute I'm up on a nigga, rippin'
That's my style
I'm a cruddy nigga leave you all bloody nigga service with a smile
Suck my dick
And while you niggas that's been to jail before know it's about to get thick
Let's get it on baby
I'm gonna be goin' against 4 niggas in one and you think you crazy?
I've lost my mind
And I'm about to make you lose yours too from far away one time

[CHORUS] x4

D-M-X!
