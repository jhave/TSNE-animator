[Cee-Lo 1st verse]
Hey, the sun is shining looking like another wonderful day
Look through my sweet collection trying to find some good music to play
While I'm getting ready to face the world
Doing what I must do..know sugar
Nothing compares to waking up this morning to you

[Chorus]
Good morning
Baby, how you been?
Did you sleep well last night honey?
Well I'm off to work again

[Cee-Lo 2nd verse]
Listen I'll call you later
Maybe we can get something to eat
How about our favorite restaurant darling
Where we usually eat
I said whew! Umm um sure looking mighty fine
I can hardly wait for quitting time

[Chorus]
Good afternoon baby
I sure missed you while I was gone
But you know I got to work honey, Hey let's just do something later on

[Cee-Lo 3rd verse]
Let's go for a walk nothing gets you in the mood better than a little moonlight
Um hmm, or we can rent some movies and make it a blockbuster night, Hey
Does that sound interesting baby? Sound like an idea?
I would gladly walk you home but you're already here

[Chorus]
Good night baby
I spent the whole day with my friend
Hopefully God will wake me up baby to see you in the morning

[Bridge]
Oh child
Oh because you everything, everything, everything to me
Oh yeah girl I need your love each and everyday Hey
Hmm, child
Hhmmmmmmmmm
Good night baby</pre>
