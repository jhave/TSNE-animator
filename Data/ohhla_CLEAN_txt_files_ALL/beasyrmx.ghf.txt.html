"Don't fuck with Ghost, you'll feel sorry"

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Tell your crew to be easy, niggaz run around
With them fake frowns, sell 'em on eBay
Get word to the DJ, tell 'em Staten Island's
In the house, put the record on replay

[Ghostface Killah]
Colorful kicks and my closet like Baskin-Robbins
Central Park killings, stab niggas while they jogging
No shirt on, whilin' like I sniffed the eight
At the ball game, jumped down and stole the base
Some muthafuckas said it was bass
Silly me, thought it was a 12 by 12 inch Colombian snowflake
Mob Jacob slow cut 8 six, the semi have
Niggas running like Forrest when he broke his braces, pa
Scold a nigga like a pile of hot chocolate
Before I eat her, I belong on a bitch cartridge
Niggas kill me potraying that hard shit
Shove his face in the dirt like an ostrich
On some mob shit, no talking, like we resolve shit
Stretch a nigga out like an enlarged dick
That's one for you, one-two for me
I'm hoggin' and shit, y'all muthafuckas best to be easy

[Interlude: Ice Cube]
The pyroclastic flow, you know the side, bitch
You know the side, bitch, huh, ah

[Ice Cube]
Fuck you, if you don't think I get money
I get it all day, standing in the hallway
On broadway, bitches wanna call Shea
Over to the car, but hoe, I'm the superstar
Get your ass out, fuck if you pass out
Walk over to ya man, pull the cash out
Put it in my hand, watch a nigga mash out
Walk back to your car, with your ass out
Fuck a ghostwriter, nigga down wit Ghostface
I'm a killa, wit that chrome in ya face
Blow ya face back, turn you into a ghost
Hit you like Kenny hit Casper on the post
West coast, ya hoe, ya gotta love it
It's Ice Cube, yea, bitch, I got it covered
I got a movie for ya kids, a dick for your bitch
A four-five slug for your wig
They wanna put me out the league like Terrell
Til they CD smokin' double barrels
Ice Cube, will fuck off movie money
Then serve you on the mic, and make whitey feel funny

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah... what's happpening New York City?
It's ya boy Ghost in the muthafuckin' house tonight
("Don't fuck with Ghost, you'll feel sorry")
Nahwhatimean? We about to get it popping, let's go!
Yo! Yo!

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Get your nose blowned off by the fifth, uh
You wanna be there, layin' all stiff, uh
Everytime you go uptown, you get jipped, uh
That's karma, boy, running your lip, uh
You be fronting like you got a bunch of chicks, uh
You be at home, nigga, beating your dick, uh
I'm in the club with the chipped up wrist, uh
You at the bar, whoadie, drinkin' my piss, uh
The yellow shit, and the bottle ain't Crys', son
You turned your muthafuckin' head, nigga, we switched 'em
You just mad cause I'm hittin' your sister
You in the other room, huh, you couldn't sleep, uh
Pop a lotta shit without that liquor, yup
We mind seat up, so take our picture
I'm like the boogeyman, nigga, I'll get ya
Whether now or later, afterlife, or switcher

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, oh shit, aiyo Tone hurry up and get 'em, nigga
You knowhatimean, it's about to pop off!
Ya'll niggaz clear the fucking floor
Get the fuck out the way, come on!

[Chorus]

[Trife Diesel] (Ghostface Killah) {both}
Yo, it's Tone in the building (the teams in the building)
Niggaz wanna beef {what up, what up, what up}
We packed to the ceiling (we constantly chilling)
We can cause {we could, we shoot, we slice, we cut}

[Ghostface Killah]
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yea, now
Yes, my birthday, landed in nay, now
Peace to Dirt Dog, I'm back like deja vu
Leave your girl around me, I will bag your boo
Ahh, you bitch niggaz better listen up
Anybody front, paramedics gonna pick 'em up
They try to save you, sware to God, I hit the nurse up
Like "Nah, doc, he look better in a herse truck"
I tried to ignore it, his people saw it
I ain't the type of dude you go to war with
My polo gun yo, will crack the floor shit
When the heat's on, you know I draw it
I had his number down, Toney just called it

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, that's right
I like to thank y'all for coming out tonight
How y'all like that shit? Youknowhatimean?
You really run New York
This is that Theodore shit, muthafucker!</pre>
