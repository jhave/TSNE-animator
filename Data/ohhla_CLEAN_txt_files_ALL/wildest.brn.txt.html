[Intro]
Oh, never, hey
Never, oh, never hey
Never, oh, never hey
Never, oh, never hey

Out of an unknown place
Kinda like left field
You came in my life and helped me heal
Just in the nick of time
When I lacked the will to keep on moving on
You've been in my dreams, but from now
Couldn't figure out the reasons
I kept asking God why
And now I'm receiving abundance of love
And I get it,
But never could imagine it

Never in my wildest dreams, no, no, no
Did I think someone could care about me, oh
Not just the way you love me
You know I'm emotional (sometimes)
Not in, not in, not in, not in my wildest dreams
Never in my wildest dreams (never in my life)
Did I think someone could care about me
(It's so beautiful)
Not just the way you love me
You know I'm emotional (sometimes)
Not in, not in, not in, my wildest dreams
Never, never, oh, never hey
Never, never, oh, never hey
Never, never, oh, never hey

It's hard to hold back tears,
Whenever you hold me close
I think about the years I spent saying this is all I want
Just wanted someone real to love me for me, me
Just Brandy
It seemed I had it all, that's what they thought
But I was peeling like paint on the wall
Had to cover up the hurt (hurt, hurt)
Uh, I was told by many, that they loved me
But it wasn't love like this

Never in my wildest dreams,
(Never in my wildest dreams)
Did I think someone could care about me, oh
(so beautiful)
Not just the way you love me
You know I'm emotional sometimes
(so emotional)
Not in, not in, not in, not in my wildest dreams
Never in my wildest dreams,
(couldn't have came in a better time)
Did I think someone could care about me
(not the way that you do)
Not just the way you love me
You know I'm emotional sometimes

I'll give all I have, for exchange
To have someone who love me for me
(Anything can be replaced)
Not love
There ain't no replacement, it either is or it ain't

Never in my wildest dreams,
(Never in my life, no)
Did I think someone could care about me, oh
(no beautiful)
Not just the way you love me
You know I'm emotional sometimes
(you know how I get)
Not in, not in, not in, not in my wildest dreams
Never in my wildest dreams, never in my life
Did I think someone could care about me
Not just the way you love me
(It's not just the way you love me)
You know I'm emotional sometimes
Not in, not in, not in, my wildest dreams</pre>
