[Chorus: Chuck D]
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright now, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
ALRIGHT NOW!!

[Hook: Chuck D]
Fingers in the air, like you really give a damn
Peace sign up, let me hear you say: YEAH!! 
Power to The People, put your hands in the air
Peace sign high, like you really do care
Fingers in the air, like you really give a damn
Peace sign up, let me hear you say: YEAH!!

Peace sign high, like you really do care
COME ON!!

Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
ALRIGHT NOW!!

[Verse One: Chuck D]
Rather be sitting just to get in it
Power to the people not the governments
Capitalists, communists and terrorists
Swear to God, I don't know the difference
Making new slaves out of the immigrants
Want to know where all the money went
Another trillion spent by the government
Here the bomb go, sent by the presidents
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, CAUSE THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE!!
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, CAUSE THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE!!
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, CAUSE THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE!!
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, CAUSE THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE!!
COME ON!!

[Chorus: Chuck D]
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
ALRIGHT NOW!!

[Verse Two: Chuck D]
Tell the leaders, they got to feed us
Grand Theft Oil, gonna bleed us
New Whirl Ordor, doesn't need us
Call for peace, better heed us
Dictators, Human Haters
Hand on the bomb, Mass Debators
Finger on the button, infiltrators
MAKE LOVE, FUCK, WORLD, PEACE will slave us
Yeah, COME ON!!

[Chorus: Chuck D]
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright now, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
ALRIGHT NOW!!
Break it now, break it now

[Hook: Flavor Flav]
Check one two.. 
We want everybody to put this sign up in the air 
And at the count of three
Everybody tell me what this sign means: PEACE!!
COME ON!!

[Chorus: Chuck D]
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright now, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
ALRIGHT NOW!! COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright now, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
ALRIGHT NOW!! 
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, CAUSE THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE!!
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, CAUSE THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE!!
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, CAUSE THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE!!
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, CAUSE THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE!!
