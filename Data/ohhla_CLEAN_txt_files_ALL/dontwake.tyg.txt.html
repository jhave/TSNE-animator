Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uhh, Ambiens in my travel bag... fiji water first class destination France
Fascinated by my watch hypnotic trance we're on a coast jets skin
With exotic fish, I like a fresh seabass on my plate
Cruise ship dinner'cause the dollar levitate yours like a centipede
Slower than a turtle, face pop shake lap dance move your body like a snake
It's all Gucci when dollars is flowing poorin moette in bitches hair living in a moment
Tell your mother you're good, I'm a rap star... to pay the hood
Took the top off, batcave, bat car, bat man, mask off
Bruce Wayne in the flesh mister out front, house guest in bed with the genie look
Always winnin, when you don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
So don't wake nigga up, don't wake nigga up
Mother fucker I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
Don't wake nigga up, don't wake nigga up
Mother fucker I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming

Uhh, eatin taters waking up in Vegas
Some girl look like Katy Perry said we had her naked
The hangover can't remember shit we barely made it
House keepers said there's panties hangin from the ceilin tygas stripe, bed and penthouse guest level
We all got suites niggaz all thorough
Turn the jazz on said she 32 but she like em young
Real milf she blow me like bubble yum
Hawt, don't spit till a nigga done
Ten minutes recoop beating like a drum
We all getting laid tonight it's a laker night
Win it in over time, prime time on your satelite
YMCMB that's Tyga tight
Last king covered in gold, you see me dazin so nigga don't

[Chorus]
Don't wake nigga up, don't wake nigga up
Mother fucker I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
Don't wake nigga up, don't wake nigga up
Mother fucker I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming</pre>
