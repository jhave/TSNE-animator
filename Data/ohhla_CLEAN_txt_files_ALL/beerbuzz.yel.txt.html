[Intro - spoken]
Hey Supahot Beats, hey Jim Johnson
I need y'all to drop me some of that country-ass shit
I need somethin' that'll make Sheryl Crow go
"goddamn, that shit's raw right there"

[Chorus]
I like a good beer buzz, early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels off his bottles of Bud. [x2]

[Verse 1]
You know the sun shines real early in the mornin' time
through the window of my trailer in the pines
I need a little somethin' to shade that light, a beer buzz starts my day off right
Granny's in the kitchen, cookin' and singin'
Zoup get me up, look at what he brings in
Hey, ain't that a 12 pack, buddy? "Yessir, you know I ride dirty"
I ain't even got a shower yet, but I devour a 12oz. in 3 seconds
And its a alchy's weddin', I married the Bud and know I'm in Heaven
Sheryl Crow is the queen, I really I wish I had her here to drink with me
But for now, it's just me and Dixie
I'm one down, Transent hit me

[Chorus]
I like a good beer buzz, early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels off his bottles of Bud. [x2]

[Verse 2]
Well, the roosters crowin'. My boxers saggin' and my ass is showin'
Walkin' through the yard to get my mail
I'm feelin' good if I say so myself
Wave to the neighbor, sittin' on his porch
He hates my guts, yeah of course
His daughter hangs out with us on the weekends
But I throw the peace sign, cheers my friend
I ain't got no problems here. I drink beer, my head is clear
My eyes are foggy, I don't feel groggy
Will I drink more by 12? Prob'ly
But now I'm chilled out though, tuesday mornin' nowhere to go
Fire up the grill and call some bros, we four-wheel drivin' off the road, like that

[Chorus]
I like a good beer buzz, early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels off his bottles of Bud. [x2]

[Verse 3]
Chillin' on a monday, drinkin' my brew day
For another beer I'll gladly pay you on tuesday
Come on lets ride around, get high ride around
Six pack, twelve pack, we can all drink 'em down
Drink 'em down, drink 'em down, drink 'em down, drink 'em down
Six pack, twelve pack, we can all drink 'em down

[Spoken outro over chorus]
I like a good beer buzz, early in the mornin'...from his bottles of Bud, don't you?
That's right, early in the mornin'
Catfish Billy...from his bottles of Bud
Hey, you know this is the kinda jam you can just drink to
But then again, you can drink to all my shit
Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
Yo, early in the mornin'...yeah
Dixie Mafia, Supahot Beats...from his bottles of Bud</pre>
