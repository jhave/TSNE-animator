Yeah, better believe that slick
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha yeah
I Thought you said you was the G-O-D
sound like another nigger to me, ha ha, yeah
I thought you said you was the G-O-D
sound like another nigger to me, shit
What a nigger do, what a nigger does
and a nigger is what a nigger was
and a nigger done read history but yet his eyes didn't see
the only reason you a nigger is because somebody else wants you to be
well a nigger uneducated, intergrated, singin' "We shall overcome"
A nigger trying to be white is what a nigger seem like have become
and when they call me a nigger to my face' 
can't do nothin' but walk away
but here it is niggers call other niggers niggers each and every day
dividing and conquering 
when they say the lighter shade of black is okay
after the middle class and they passin' by 
the project land where we stay
since a nigger had got grown, had a little bitty of nigger of my own
should've known I couldn't show 'em no better what I was showin'
Shit, I could've hit the club as fresh as I could be
really, all for another nigger to see
you know how a nigger get when he see another nigger outfit 
don't want nobody to have what he ain't got
somebody get drunk, get mad, and get shot
that why the property value ain't no good in a nigger neihborhood
a nigger could overstand if he only understood
I'm sick of lyin' I'm sick of glorifyin' dyin'
I'm sick of not trying, shit I'm sick of being a nigger
destiny sent me to this dread and she said she felt led
to offer me some wisdom from this notebook she read
and it said that right then the black man's downfall
was not know that we were not ever niggers at all, hmm
and she looked deeply into my eyes and said brother don't you know
you complain about being black, 
when they mad coz they can't be black no mo'
so many black men out here trying to be niggers
keeping it real to the point that they dying to be niggers
when in actuality the fact is you ain't a nigger because you black
you a nigger cause of how you act
but, you don't want me to tell you the truth, so I'ma lie to you
make it sound fly to you huh, huh,
you don't wanna hear the truth, so I'ma lie to you 
make it sound fly to you, shit
The nigger experience

has been stated, it was created
