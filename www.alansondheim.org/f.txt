There fell a frost in the night of spring,
It fell on the tender blossoms young
And they are withered and faded.

A lad once loved a maiden fair,
They fled in secret from house and home,
They told neither father nor mother.

They roamed and wandered here and there,
They had nor luck nor guiding star,
They fell by the wayside and perished.

Er fiel auf die zarten Blaublumelein,
Sie sind verwelket, verdorret.

Ein Jungling hatte ein Madchen lieb,
Sie flohen heimlich von Hause fort,
Es wusst weder Vater noch Mutter.

All the characteristics of life may be defined by states and processes.
There must be an ontological framework capable of shifting from one world
to another, in order that the definition holds. Only if one insists that
life is a natural kind based on a material environment, material exchange,
does artificial life fail to meet the criteria. Worlding occurs within
ontological frameworks, attributed frames; the question is whether life
can occur within them, whether they would support a set X of fundamental
processes. Such processes involve exchange with imminent environment. For
example, one can create computer lifeforms which have no necessity to
absorb energy; they reproduce wildly and competitively. Conversely, one
can create lifeforms which do not reproduce, but horde, absorb, and
compete for food. Certain large marine worms near deep-sea thermal vents
absorb nourishment without the necessity of a digestive system. Energy
must always be present in an operational environment; in the case of
artificial life, the environment itself may form an ontological foundation
for existence; the two exist in entirely different worlds. One can, in 
fact, consider a _new topodynamics_ of lifeforms, in which _no_ specific 
attribute is necessary for an evolving definition of "life." Definitions 
then become a matter of degree within a holarchic structure, a consensus- 
situation or fammily of usages. These are important considerations for 
the philosophy of computer/human interactions. It is only to be noted in 
conclusion that we are still bound within the state/operator or noun/ 
verb model of programming itself; either this is to be taken as a funda- 
mental condition of the real, or one can look towards other domains for 
future implementation.

(Life and Nearly Decomposable Hierarchies, follow-up post)


Was it Simon who years ago wrote about nearly decomposable hierarchies -
that for example, Aristotelian logic (including laws of distribution,
etc.) could hold on a macro-level almost and in spite of its failure
within the quantum domain? One of the stranger characteristics of our
universe is the ability of levels, spaces, and times, to nearly foreclose
upon each other, seamlessly, much as the ego appears to do the same (and
yet is more of a coagulating/inscribing flow). In which case, life itself
exists as foreclosure, which is why I think we can talk about computer
life _and_ ignore the matrix which provides its energy. Clifford pointed
out that entities within a closed universe could still determine its local
topology and curvature (this before Einstein); whether computer life could
see "elsewhere" remains open to question. Anyone who believes in spirit or
other manifestations of apparent nearly autonomous (although perhaps
interpenetrating) realms would assume, I assume, that life is inductive in
such a fashion that its very gestural qualities take it beyond or beside
itself. But one in return could conceive of spirit _within_ artificial
life, in which case perhaps the questions continue to be asked. As in at
least some models of inflationary universes, there may be realms that we
literally have no access whatsoever to. We seem to have our energy problem
settled within the local universe; I am picturing artificial life that 
doesn't. And such life, in fact, may not recognize energy as a category 
at all, except for local conservations. I think this would vastly change 
the appearance of entropy, and hence, information, by the way - does any- 
one who knows these mathematical formulations (better than I certainly), 
have any ideas on this?

Metamorphosis


The neuron was added at random; I had no idea where to place it in 
relation to a network I didn't understand, and which was not mapped out 
anywhere in the program I was given. Only the addition was possible, and 
I found myself setting capacitance, membrane potential, and the like, 
more or less by chance. I'd return to the creature on the screen, a 
cockroach which had the ability to navigate a closed environment, a roach 
governed by a limited amount of energy, and a food drive when that energy 
ran low. It possessed six legs, antennae, and the ability to move through 
the space, somewhat clumsily. I do not know whether it had the ability to 
learn, but the movements were sophisticated.

My first try resulted in the stretching of one of the legs, never to the 
breaking point, since that wasn't built into the program; the leg would 
then return quickly to the insect. It hobbled across the screen, banging 
up against the corner, turning backwards and forwards as its antennae 
gave alternating readings of the situation. There wasn't any way in or 
out, and the banging continued, hopelessly I thought, until the energy 
ran out, the creature ground to a halt, the program read RIP.

My second try resulted in program crashes, one after another; the insect 
never knew about them, never was cognizant of the flickering of the 
environment, life itself, in and out of existence. It was there, always 
looking normal, the same, turned in one or another direction, waiting for 
the return-key in order for it to progress towards some new goal, that of 
merely staying alive overriding everything else.

And my third try, the last, before the final crash, resulted in legs
undercutting legs, legs on top of legs, a real hobble, what appeared to be
crippled behavior straight out of Charles Dickens. I couldn't watch it for
long on the screen; the schematic roach began to be a source of projec-
tion, not of fantasy, but of my own body, and the body of every living
creature; it was losing its somewhat symmetrical exterior as the legs
splayed almost painfully against one another. The vision was one of
empathy and horror; I had created the insect, wounded and dysfunctional,
and I wondered if this were always the case, the source of Frankenstein
and other golem _formations._ (Is this the sense of tampering with the 
"natural," sublimating childbirth, playing Faust? Are we always already 
damaging ourselves as biochemistry and programming simultaneously devour 
our boides?)

The computer refused to save the new neuron and its settings; they over-
flowed memory when the program was rebooted, overflowed again and again. 
As if the program refused to create the insect in its wounded state, at
least _that_ wounded, incapable of surviving, even alone with an
indefinitely large food supply. 

I learned a great deal from this, subject and object of my own experiment
and victim of a pursuit that could only turn back reflexively, as a Klein
bottle, without extrance or exit. Pain always resides in the other, iso-
lating the body, cauterizing it, dividing it from itself; a wounded body
is a piecemeal body. Objects float before and beyond the senses, general-
izing the phenomenological horizon to include extruded body-parts. As
Rimbaud said, I am an other. The roach couldn't _account_ for anything,
learned nothing. I envied Kafka. 

		And all men kill the thing they love,
		 By all let this be heard,
		Some do it with a bitter look,
		 Some with a flattering word,
		The coward does it with a kiss,
		 The brave man with a sword!

[These musings continue to touch on life, artificial life, and the arti- 
ficiality of life. I feel somewhat over my head here, but it's necessary 
for me at least to pursue this to the end. Forgive.]


AIAL


Can we differentiate artificial life from artificial intelligence? 
Clearly they are subsets of each other, the former occupying a bandwidth
ranging from robotics (interaction in physical reality) to computer 
viruses. In general, intelligence is currently aligned with the rich 
resources of the real; the Turing test depends on it. (A computer might 
know about the prime-number-world; a human knows more about politics, the 
weather, etc. - _rich-fields_ instead of isolated parameters.) But I may 
assume for the moment the self-containment of artificial life, existing 
within micro-worlds.

I think that the notion of a "seamless virtual reality," entirely con- 
ceivable to date as a gedankenexperiment, if not in real life, plays a 
role here as well. Inner and outer worlds begin to merge; our useless 
burning of energy, trashing of the planet, provides a clue towards our 
own ontological isolation. But this could be programmed as well; there is 
no escape, just as there is ultimately no escape from solicism, or any 
ideology that embraces negation, alterity, and the other, within its 
totalizing armature.

These issues, like Lacan's use of the Borromean knows, intertwine in fact 
hopelessly:

1 - the idea of a foreclosed and controlled environment 
2 - the idea of a set of attributes defining artificial or real life 
3 - the idea of a distinction among nature, culture, artificial, real 
4 - the epistemology and interfacing of the controlled environment in 
relation to a_meta-environment_ 
5 - the possibilities of closed topologies (mobius strip-like) bringing 
environment and meta-environment full-circle into indistinguishable 
levels
6 - issues of intelligence and artificial intelligence in relation to 
mind 

For this reason, again, my conclusion would be that _life_ possesses no 
specifiable definition, insofar as artificial life is possible; that one 
at best is referencing a family of usages; that there is no absolute 
determination of our own existence as self-sustaining and/or created 
within the ontic realm of the known universe; and that there is no 
_necessary_ relationship among mind, intelligence, and life-forms. 

That being said, it should also be emphasized that there is no reason in
the above to appeal to notions of spirit, deity, or totality - it is in
fact this _absence_ that fascinates me, that lends itself to the problem-
atizing of categories of the real and "artificial." 

(One ends, in fact, by appealing to the granular or obdurate nature of 
the real, its fractal quality, realizing as well that this is at best, 
from a certain viewpoint, only a matter of bandwidth.)


--------------------|

{ Penrose presents four viewpoints relating thinking to computation:

" A. All thinking is computation; in particular, feelings of conscious 
awareness are evoked merely by the carrying out of appropriate computations.

" B. Awareness is a feature of the brain's physical action; and whereas any
physical action can be simulated computationally, computational simulation
cannot by itself evoke awareness.

" C. Appropriate physical action of the brain evokes awareness, but the 
physical action cannot even be properly simulated computationally.

" D. Awareness cannot be explained by physical, computational, or any 
other scientific terms."

Penrose's view, based on Godel, is that of C; I would hold to C as well, 
but on the basis of modeling restraints - i.e. unsolvabilities and quan- 
tum states within neural operations. Penrose holds with the latter, which 
he develops at length; for me, unsolvabilities and the very nature of 
randomness question the ability to model brain states. This isn't to say 
that _input-output_ couldn't be modeled, but that the internal states, 
and internal consciousness, would be necessarily different (neither 
better nor worse, nor more nor less developed). 

C is clearly unnecessary for any definition of artificial life, which at 
this point in its development, can be modeled by A. }

Flake _Down-Generation_


Reading writerly Ovid always from the Augustan period couplets now into 
contemporary English always transfixed from what the Romans said and did 
around the beginning of the millennia holding forth into the positive 
integers - so of course writers always build on other writers - there's 
no death of the author, nothing but the concretion, stratification, of 
writers, writers upon writers, interpretations and reinterpretations, 
writer-cement - there's no death as I said of the author but in fact the 
birth of too many authors, indistinguishable, but there, present, fixed, 
fetishized, held in no or vast regard.

Take translation each from its own period or socius, in and out of dif-
ferent languagings, even the original embedded in the fractal associations
of inconceivably complex social landscapes - doesn't each audience find 
its translation, _its_ translation, up-to-date, all this writing and re- 
writing, scribbling in the ether, scribbling on every buried and dead bit 
of matter dug up no matter where, scribbling on burials upon burials... 

And doesn't each audience find _its_ translation the currency of good
design, well-met - the species exhausts itself with symbolic construction,
continuous modification, a tattered pipeline filtering a tattered pipe- 
line, self-same or similar, a spew so far endless, origins non-existent, 
uncanny, violating in their absence -

O the songs still resonate Ovidian whatever that means, from the 1960s
from the 1980s from the 2000s, just as they resonate now in their fullness
in their currency, in 2010, we're engorged with them, eyes blasted from 
the third millennium already, void tottering on abyss leaning into chaos, 
shore it up, shore it all up, virtual reality against annihilation, we 
bring our toys together, hounded by disease - aids seems naive in lieu of 
the current conflagration - there's nothing to learn -

The _down-generation_ in revolt, gen-Xers never even understood that at 
the center of their name was the same old crossroads, a continuous run 
dividing and dividing, continuous run to nowhere at all -

Subject: Burnout 




Recently, I've begun to feel burnout on the net, on ascii, on all the 
analysis, not being able to enter into the pleasure of the text which 
scrolls _exactly_ down the screen over and over again. So I thought I'd 
write about it. 

The dreams have stopped, there's no more scrolling _there,_ and they've 
returned to the troubled dreams of several months ago, anguish over the 
loss of an ex-girlfriend, real geographic cataclysms and terror on the 
streets. Administration takes up less time, but for me the growth of 
these lists has been slow, and we've lost a lot of people I've valued, 
although new ones come on. I seem to be one of the few constants here; 
I'm always here, public and private email both, running in the same 
circuits, watching the fragility of net relationships transform them as 
soon as real life comes once again to the foreground.

The integration isn't here for me; I've got a strong homing-instinct now, 
and finding myself without a relationship in the city, without suitable 
finances, without a place I _like_ living in, the net takes on burdens 
that make no sense in the long run. There's been a natural progression 
from thinking about nets and communities through third sex to artificial 
life; it seems to me if life succeeds in this space, it succeeds as 
_lateral_ life, that is life that recognizes itself _within_ the medium, 
not elsewhere. 

But if we're healthy we _are_ elsewhere, and it's in the complexity of
daily life that struggles occur over thinking the Oklahoma bombing
through, over thinking about alterity, over so much more. I find myself
constantly running back to books so as not to oversimplify my arguments:
for example, what's "artificial" in artificial life? 

But then some of the discussions _here_ do contain considerable 
complexity - it's not that.

Maybe it's the way the text burns through my eyelids, no matter the color 
of the words on the screen.

Maybe it's not seeing the shadow of someone disappear as she leaves, or 
the knock at the door before someone enters. 

The net proves insidious; part of burnout is watching real life itself 
become distanced, finding myself thinking through a relationship that is 
90% text and will always be that way.

Late at night voices speak to me, on unixtalk, on the phone occasionally. 
There has to be more to life than the wires, more central to life. It's 
interesting to watch Andy Hawks over on Future Culture (although I'm off 
the list now), beginning it, talking about feeling the wires, later 
leaving, then returning.

Is everything packaged here? Is that why I so easily relate (I won't 
speak for anyone else), yet feel that there is utter darkness surrounding 
the terminal? Maybe that's why the MOO anonymity or identity morphing is 
problematic for me, more packaging, more programming. I find myself 
on-line or teaching off-line moving from one program to another, here's 
the world wide web worm, there's veronica, here's unixtalk, there's a 
moo, here's a caucus system...

I'm going to stay on. I need something real, though. More and more I
understand addiction to drugs; it would be an odd relief to be forced to
relate to the grittiness of _substance,_ alcohol or cocaine. It won't
happen though. Instead, I find myself still retreating within the virtual;
instead of Warwickian bodies vis-a-vis Nick Land and the other Deleuze-
Guattarians, I'm sending a videotape, another virtuality to accompany the
Virtual Futures conference. Another effacement, distanciation. 

I feel crippled here, a sure sign of burnout...

originating huddling near the top of the screen; they're inscribed there,
already a totality or curtain-rod, mass lending itself to the procuring of
an audience, guiding the reader into the text's desire. compressed, the
curtain of opposing empty space falls from line after line; numerous, they
will end somewhere, leaving infinite and empty scroll pouring underneath,
effluvia of vacated thought. each domain of the text, each topography, is
guided by the tether to thinking, by the unfolding of cloth. there are no

texts refresh instantaneously on the screen, transforming into the begin-
ning of our thinking together, the terror and relief of the construct of
origin.  the screen begins to fill, Rabelaisian, and there are moments
when the flood runs itself in the vicinity of thought, thoughtless, work-
ing the bridges and routers of words of worlds, turning the cared-for
phrase until the liminal moment once again manifests itself. 

content gathers in the liminal, breath held or harvested, the horizon of
distance always a distraction. we plunge paragraphs deep, into always
familiar strata, sediments, always a certain relief as well that the
saying is occurring. 

the saying is occurring and developing, filling itself towards the
margins, huddled again constantly adjacent to the left-hand sheaf from
which everything proceeds: towards fulfillment, thought running out,
cloacal, urinary, the _thirst_ of it. 

the thought that <when a vinyl record becomes worn, it absorbs the world 
- cracks and hisses carrying a history of deterioration, old-age death. 
a cd on the other hand gestures hopelessly towards the eternal - the 
impingement of the world constructs absence, hiatus, diminution. there is 
no history in the resulting gaps or channel skips - only the absence of 
worlding, uncanny silence and invisibility.>:

which would not have been the thought or the thinking of it. beneath, the
text, still hanging, through skin sloping into exegeses of the labial,
through the weight of the line transformed into teats, begins to close in
on itself, an inverted trapezoid, clitoral, mute, abjuring climax or
effect. we'll see it cried, the pain of the letter itself turned forward,
backward, wobbling into the commonalities of expedient text. the screen
scrolls forth, words and lines shift uneasily, the rim of an infinite
wheel which returns, qua Nietzsche, only within an inconceivable future,
already inscribed, grinding inscription into the fundamental ground,
grinding of fundament, ground glass reticule of the terminal screen
screamed.

Hypertext, Gaps, Limbs, Architecture


The swollen internet is tumor-oriented, ruptured with the decay of
information, tethers, traces following through links which wind uselessly
through the history of the human. If hypertext provides gaps or hiatus in
relation to tunneling through the virtuality of links (which are notated,
for the most part, presenced on the surface), then gaps themselves are
hypertexts, _not_ the linked document, but the raw absenced and sutured
materiality of the hole itself. All texts become rim-texts; nodal sites,
in their vectoring, are intensifications rather than signposts, the accre-
tion of the symbolic to the useless. 

What is useless is the knowledge itself, beyond the domain of the _rat-
tler,_ the stuttering of facticity across the disciplinary panopticon,
frameworking knowledge at every level.

"These spirals of misprision and division are deployed across the highest 
and lowest levels of hypertextual discourse. This is what takes place at 
the hypertextual detour: a diachronic characteristic of narrative 
digression - the turn at the link - replays the turn at the synchronic 
level of the link as a signifier of _pure difference._ On each level, 
meaning is a function of difference: the slippage in the signifying chain 
at the level of the sign is articulated at the higher level of narrative, 
in the slippage between linked threads in the weave of a docuverse. The 
gap-ridden structure of the hypertext makes explicit the underlying gaps 
in the fabric of language from which it is constructed, and in which the 
consumer of the hypertext is constituted as a subject of language." 
(Terence Harpold, "Threnody: Psychoanalytic Digressions on the Subject of 
Hypertexts," in Delany and Landow, Hypermedia and Literary Studies.)

What Harpold constructs as "gap-ridden," is in fact over-determined, not 
slippage so much as _limb_ sliced thick, resilient. And in fact, the con- 
sumer of hypertext may be de-constituted through subjugation of language; 
it's within the epistolary-novel conditions of email lists, for example, 
that subjectivity flourishes through the hysteria of the text. The thick 
rupture of the hypertextual surface, ungapped but sloughing elsewhere, 
returns language-as-subject whose underpinnings "might as well be" any- 
where. Hypertextual _activity,_ the labor of the reader, is _varied,_ a 
question of choosing, setting-aside, standing back. But the freedom is 
illusory - and I feel compelled to return to this again and again, from 
Unixtalk through MOO through hypertext - as programming recedes. In this 
sense, programming imitates the discursive processes of late capitalism 
or hypercapitalism (Wired comes to mind), in which the simulacra of free- 
dom give way to... the simulacra of freedom. (It was Ben Hecht who said 
Hollywood is the place where you can scratch away the tinsel to find the 
real tinsel underneath.) 

But the labor of the subject, totally mediated in this format of reifi-
cation, nonetheless returns the subject to hirself, hardly constructed,
penetrated by language-substance which fills those deliberate wounds which
are discovered gaps by those who would still believe in architecture.

The Twenty-Six


If I have one point to make, it is only that we remain beholden to the 
twenty-six and their variants. That images of orphaned parents stand at 
the threshold of our thinking. That no one is comfortable with pain. That 
there are limited stories, that stories have their logics, that we play 
them out. That stories are orphans, beholden to the parents, thrust 
against the repetition of the twenty-six. 

That speech carries the weight of the world, mouths move armament. That 
no excuse is excuse. That the twenty-six are pilloried by the events of 
this and other worlds. That the worlds are filled with noise fluttering 
the twenty-six. That noise is not chaos, that worlds are underdetermined.

That logic never necessitates the impingement of the point. That "of 
course" follows its own course. That "gods have no hands."

Subject: Burnout but thinking about the Net as well, bit long


(A bit long but hope I made it worthwhile.)

Trying to figure out more about burnout. I _don't_ burnout on good 
discussion, on using the Net as a resource, at all. But there are always 
tensions between what is promised and what's really present, and this is 
true in terms of Net relationships - nothing can be real unless flesh- 
meets occur (and that term itself is painful) - and it's true of 
resources as well.

Doing research on the Net, I find huge gaps everywhere - try searching 
down invertebrate paleontology for example, or serious art-history 
research tools. There's almost nothing. 

There are good discussions in the less-known newsgroups and fun for a 
while in some of the others. Everywhere, I'm aware of programming, 
working within the narrow confines of packaged creativity; on the MOO you 
dig without a license or fear of destroying the environment; in the news- 
groups, structures and stars develop quickly. Community develops so 
quickly everywhere that I wonder about its depth or sincerity; some of 
the most committed members of Cybermind have left for example, sudden 
disappearances that in real life would be accompanied by mourning or 
suspicions of death.

I'm envious of successful cyber-relationships, love affairs. I find them
almost impossible to maintain, and the sheer weight of real life dominates
of course, ultimately either destroying them or making them leave the 
computer for the physical. But then I may not be built for this medium - 
my expectations are likely askew.

Hypertext too seems problematic to me; the disruptions again are
programmed and the holes in the text destroyed worlds with an automated
consistency. MYST doesn't do that; sheer visuality overcomes and
participates in the diegesis. But too often on text-driven web I've found
myself losing track of the investigation, with the continuous presence of
distractions. 

Gopher often deadends; ftp thank god made it to lynx where it's reasonably
fast and you can read on-screen. Try finding though the poetry of John
Skelton - it's there, hidden away - I stumbled upon it by accident - and
have seen almost no references to it. And it's in .html just as everything
here moves through the programmatic; if you read anything, it's by
courtesy of a program that may or may not have tampered with the original. 

A lot of us are hurting, are looking for love, are sexual in the space. 
For myself, when the appropriate application closes, the screen slams 
against the body, emptying it completely of affect; one's faced not only 
with mortality but absolute isolation. The only recourse is to return 
again and again - it's the appeal of pornography - the _next image_ will 
do it finally for me, there will never be the need for another...

And for me the email lists get closer to an ideal community; they have the
time and space of thought between the posts, and the ability to work
through reasonably complex ideas. They can present extremely long posts
which can be searched, replied to, and thoughtfully sent back onto the
queue. But the discussions often deadend early, participants leave, and
the constant morphing means that a community of discourse often repeats
its thinking, just as Cybermind might again and again bring up issues of
embodiment that were discussed by members earlier, covering the same 
points.

I find myself teaching on-line, editing on-line, loving on-line, being 
on-line, administering on-line. And trying to work through all of the 
above is ultimately trying to work through consistencies or stases within 
ascii text itself, posts by someone I really care about, or downloaded 
pictures of the Joshua Tree National Monument for example. 

I'm totally pro-Internet; the future is here, this is the frontier. But 
it's not miracles, it's not the edge of research (although on private 
email lists etc. it's a place where the edge is discussed), and it's 
exhausting. I don't think organic life was built for it. I don't think we 
have the radiowaves, the binary in our heads.

But things will change; we have to realize we're on the cusp of something,
and that's what keeps me going. The cusp is this: that the senses will 
_increase_ in this space, MOOs might actually reflect virtual architecture 
(_and_ the labor that is needed for any building), email lists might 
become capable of multimedia, and I can even look forward to the Burgess 
Shale fauna in a complete photographic catalog somewhere. At the moment, 
though, we should keep in mind both our privilege and our poverty, and 
the fact that this _isn't_ utopia by a long-shot. And if it's even going 
to approach real-life communities, it's going to take more commitment, 
maybe, than we're willing to give it.

(And maybe more money. I've yet to even approach multi-media, and can't 
afford it. Only by virtue of the New School do I have any Mosaic and 
Netscape access - and my god, compared to the rate I move, they're 
unbearably slow. Maybe I should take prozak, ludes, anything to match the 
endless stuttering of the image upon the screen.)

Path and Road


From Jabes, The Book of Dialogue:

  A young man went to see his Teacher and said: "May I talk to you?"
  The Teacher answered: "Come back tomorrow. Then we'll talk."
  The day after, the young man came back and said: "May I talk to you?"
  As on the day before, the Teacher answered: "Come back tomorrow. Then 
we'll talk."
  "I came yesterday and asked you this same question," replied the young 
man, disappointed. "Do you refuse to talk to me?"
  "We have been in dialogue since yesterday," replied the Teacher, 
smiling. "Whose fault if we have bad ears?"

From Jabes, The Ineffaceable  The Unperceived:

THE PRE-EXISTENCE OF THE LAST BOOK

    The last book is the book of God, a book which would have been 
  man's first had he been able to write it.

    Then there would be books and books all claiming to be the last.

    We shall never know the last book; perhaps because we have always, 
  dimly, known it?
    Likewise God.

    You do not write what you know, but what you are unaware you know and 
  then discover, without surprise, you have always known.
    As one knows that death is the end or that in a few hours it will be 
  day. 
    As if you were, in short, exploring a past diverted from the course 
  of your memory, but originally yours.

From Jabes, The Book of Resemblances:

  The book leans on the void.

From Jabes, The Book of Resemblances:

  Any book is but a dim likeness of the lost book.

  "In each of us," he said, "there is a book that transforms us into 
words, as blood forms in the blood.
  "To each utterance each word, corresponds a heartbeat.
  "The book's price is the price of an alliance."

(translation, Rosmarie Waldrop)

The uncanny (dis)ordering of the book, book and Book, letters fluttered 
against the desert like sand unto sand, the ordering is implicate, 
folded, folds upon folds, the skin of the body turned, sloughed in the 
sun of the desert, glowing in the midst of sand melted into translucent 
glass. O the book is singularity, encompassing trace, paths of glass 
sheeting, discourse of continuity, utterance upon utterance beneath the 
burning wires of the sun, O the book writes itself upon us, inscribes us 
one to another, the gainsaying of death, lost voice dying out before 
writing brings us to ourselves, Jabes, "No book is complete." Jabes, "The 
world is exiled in the name. Within it there is the book of the world." 
Jabes, "I am a man's wanderings, path and road." We are your wandering.

Artificial Life


I am still puzzling over entropy and information in relation to artificial
life. Consider a suitably large enclosed screen environment, steady-state
in terms of energy input from an "external" framework. Is it necessarily
true then that the degree of entropy remains constant internally? Note
that there is no _increase_ of energy in this model; the quantity E is
also constant. _Within_ the environment, one can imagine local areas in
non-equilibrium potential wells, and other areas remaining in equilibrium
with a specified degree of disorder. Within the wells, information
increases; this is ultimately a result of the external energy input. Such
input transforms into _time._ The question is what happens to the entropy? 
In a closed system with finite energy, entropy increases; in our system,
which may be considered _virtually open,_ entropy seems to decrease as
information increases.* Ultimately, can one consider the environment _to-
tally ordered,_ and what would constitute this? Would this be - or more to
the point _could_ this be a form of self-organization, self-conscious-
ness, and if the latter, would it conceivably involved the use of external
data-storage devices? If so, these devices would presumably be aligned or
internalized with the life-forms (I wrote a story about Travis in one of
the Internet Text files about this); there would be no mechanical move-
ment, no thought processes whatsoever, already a form of death...

*which is the opposite I believe of the definition of entropy in informa- 
tion theory.

horse sacrifice


Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Muller trans: "He desired, 'Let a second body be
born of me,' and he (death or hunger) embraced speech in his mind.' Briha-
daranyaka Upanishad, Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty trans: "He desired, 'I wish
that a second body were produced for me.' He, who was hunger, death,
caused speech to copulate with mind." Possessive "his" in the first trans-
forms everything. Continue with O'Flaherty; read carefully: 

"He desired, 'Let me sacrifice more, with a greater sacrifice.' He 
exhausted himself, and he generated heat in himself, and out of him as he 
was exhausted and heated came glory and virility. Now, glory and virility 
are the vital breaths, and so when the vital breaths had gone out of him, 
his body began to swell. His mind was in his body.

"He desired, 'I wish this body were fit for sacrifice. I wish that I could
have it for my own body.' And it became a horse (_ashva_) because it had
swelled (_asvat_). 'It has become fit for sacrifice (medhyam),' he
thought, and that is why the horse sacrifice is called the Ashva-medha. 
Whoever knows him in this way really knows the horse sacrifice." 

Muller in part: "He desired that this body should be fit for sacrifice 
and that he should be embodied by it. Then he became a horse, because it 
swelled, and was fit for sacrifice; and that is why the horse-sacrifice 
is called Asva-medha." Muller later: "He (who knows this) overcomes 
another death, death does not reach him, death is his Self, he becomes 
one of those deities." This is knowledge of "the sacrificial fire and the 
Asvamedha-sacrifice." O'Flaherty: "He (who knows this) conquers repeated 
death; death does not get him; he becomes one of these gods."

The "chief queen" lays in the Shatapatha Brahmana with the suffocated 
horse; the attendants "make the chief queen (Mahishi) lie down next to 
the horse, and they cover the two of them with the upper cloth as they 
say the verse, 'Let the two of us cover ourselves in the world of 
heaven,' for the world of heaven is where they 'quiet' the sacrificial 
animal. Then they draw out the penis of the horse and place it in the 
vagina of the chief queen, while she says, 'May the vogorous virile male, 
the layer of seed, lay the seed'; this she says for sexual intercourse.
While they are lying there, the sacrificer insults the horse by saying, 
'Lift up her thighs and put it in her rectum.' No one insults (the 
sacrificer) back, lest there should be someone to act as a rival against 
the sacrificer." The horse is then dismembered and then there is a 
restoration. 

There are seeds of the Kalevala here, the restoration of Lemminkainen,
Rune XV. Nasshut kills him: "There the blood-stained son of death-land,
There Tuoni's son and hero, Cuts in pieces Lemminkainen, Chops him with
his mighty hatchet"... and the pieces are thrown in the Tuoni. (John
Martin Crawford trans) There is the beginning of a thread.

Outside of Copenhagan, the reconstruction of a horse-sacrifice.

Who sacrifices who for which knowledge is gained, who possesses which 
attributed disembodied/bodied/foreboded body? These questions are always 
already silenced. Turn now to the Poetic Edda, Havamal 138-139, Hollan- 
der's translation: 

"I wot that I hung   on the wind-tossed tree
  all of nights nine,
wounded by spear,   bespoken to Othin
  bespoken myself to myself,
[upon that tree   of which none telleth
  from what roots it doths rise].

Neither horn they upheld   nor handed me bread;
  I looked below me -
  aloud I cried -
caught up the runes,   caught them up wailing,
  thence to the ground fell again."

Self-sacrifice again for knowledge, inverted, by one of the gods them-
selves. Hollander's commentary: "Othin sacrificed himself by hanging 
himself on the World-Ash and wounding himself with his spear." Now for a 
variant, Bellows' translation, Hovamol 139-140: 

"I ween that I hung   on the windy tree,
  Hung there for nights full nine;
With the spear I was wounded,   and offered I was
  To Othin, myself to myself,
On the tree that none   may ever know
  What root beneath it runs.

None made me happy   with loaf or horn,
  And there below I looked;
I took up the runes,   shrieking I took them,
  And forthwith back I fell."

He gains "nine mighty songs" and stanza 147 again circulates among the 
realms:

"Knowest how one shall write,   knowest how one shall rede?
Knowest how one shall tint,   knowest how one makes trial?
Knowest one one shall ask,   knowest how one shall offer?
Knowest how one shall send,   knowest how one shall sacrifice?"

The ritual/repetition enters into and among the realms. One may, if one 
desires, place the Crucifixion in the midst of these scenarios. The 
distinction of course is that the state mediates, which problematizes the 
act; why, if the mediation were necessary and desired by Deity itself, 
were the Jews repeatedly chastised for their complicity? 

Death itself weaves and sutures among the worlds, which are spoken and 
written; language pervades them. In cybermind, it is our own death that 
is sacrificed; on the rim, packets stutter, reminding us of the cloacal 
nature of the dead animal/chora where all is melange. Interpenetrations 
have no resolution; Othin connects from the tree, Mahishi through the 
lingam of the horse. Disembodiment can be dismemberment, the body trans- 
formed into the broken text; reassembled, the text remains. The body 
becomes its own tattoo, everything written in the irresolution, recup- 
eration of worlds. 

O'Flaherty: "Falling apart and coming back together again is seen in 
Vedic literature as the problem of creation." ... "In particular, things 
fall apart at their junctures or liminal points, joints; 'parvan' means 
both the joint of a human body (knee, elbow, and so forth) and the 
junctures or liminal moment of transition between one time period and 
another." ... "The problem of falling apart in the act of creation is then 
analogized to the ever-present fear that the sacrifice itself will fall 
apart or go wrong in some way, which makes necessary complex restorations 
(_prayashcitti_)" ...

Moving among/between the worlds, sacrifice, death, soul, writing, speech 
all tangle in a Borromean knot; a single mistake unravels the hole/whole. 

The joints shimmer as they connect across ontologically separated 
domains, cyberspace to physical reality, the dismembered body dreaming to 
dreams of the membered body. They shimmer as interstitial connections, 
the fingers upon the keyboard, death announced over the computer screen. 
And they shimmer as conjunctions, junctures, concatenations, screen after 
screen in cyberspace, mind after mind throughout cybermind. Things seem 
terribly wrong and restoration is always part of the process; it is 
restoration that sutures worlds, and restoration is always after death. 

Healing is ontology and epistemology both; the body tears itself apart, 
sacrificing for the truth, hoping beyond hope that enough remains of good 
sense and perception to comprehend the remnants of self and desire in the 
debris.

Opening of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Muller:

"1. Verily the dawn is the head of the horse, which is fit for sacrifice, 
the sun its eye, the wind its breath, the mouth the Vaisvanara fire, the 
year the body of the sacrificial horse. Heaven is the back, the sky the 
belly the earth the chest, the quarters the two sides, the intermediate 
quarters the ribs, the members the seasons, the joints the months and 
half-months, the feet days and nights, the bones the stars, the flesh the 
clouds. The half-digested food is the sand, the rivers the bowels, the 
liver and the lungs the mountains, the hairs the herbs and trees. As the 
sun rises it is the forepart, as it sets the hindpart of the horse. When 
the horse shakes itself, then it lightens; when it kicks, it thunders; 
when it makes water, it rains; voice is its voice." [O'Flaherty: "speech 
is his whinny."]

Troping Around Ecocyb


1. Depression. The tiniest little thing makes me cry. The world is filled
with clutter whose history is lost forever. Surely that doll made someone
happy once upon a time. Surely there was a once upon a time. The cup I am
holding was turned from a tree or fossil life before the existence of
names. Did australopithecines have events. 

2. The lot down the street
remains emptied; it covers several city blocks, and building has not yet
begun, politics or funds? The neighborhood suffers as a result; older
businesses have disappeared, and new ones haven't gained a food-hold as a
result of the shaky climate. 

3. I watch my body cease to be my own; it
desires to return somewhere, anywhere, outside of this realm of trashed
illusion. Capitalism invented trash; traditional societies invented the
kitchen-midden. Their archeologies are different; in late capitalism,
knowledge = consumption. 

4. I am never sick in cyberspace, but I _report_
my sickness. Environment sublimates hysterically into body. 

5. On MOO, I
say @dig and room exists, even if permits are necessary. Environment
sublimates hysterically into text. 

6. Do we have events. Fleshmeets are
events, deaths are events. On email lists, voices disappear with an
imminence that can only be described as uncanny, terrifying, if one
insists on listening to absence. The cloaca is always already substitu- 
tion. 

7. Here we are, clean and proper bodies; nothing oozes. What of 
this ultimate ideology of cleansing, with its dubious flight from the 
maternal, from abjection? One screams to whisper. Shower stalls. The 
lessons of Kristeva, Theweleit, come to mind. 

8. Chislenko's writings on 
filtering (again): we manufacture ourselves, the ultimate postmodern 
constructivism. Essence, Jim Reith's coreman, disappears for the glitter 
of surface phenomena. The core itself abrogates essence, but at least 
within the machinery, the trolls are visible, mind in and out of the 
waters. And at least in the machinery, labor and its political economy 
are of major concern. 

9. Learning magic _here_ is a form of separation; 
not only do we believe we are not killing species, but we also believe we 
can create new ones. Artificial life, character morphing. It's precisely 
in the obdurate nature of character/body in real life (with their atten- 
dent psychoanalyses, psychotherapies, surgeries) that negation or the 
con-fronting of the other occurs. In cyberspace, the other is consumed, 
subsumed, assumed, which is no other. How much of this problematic ideo- 
logy leaks _back_ into a foreclosing of the suffering of the real? 

10. 
Living within the safe environment of the screen or screens, delimited in 
ways we can never foresee. 

11. Depression: The tiniest little thing makes me 
cry. The world is filled with clutter whose history is lost forever. In 
cyberspace there is no history that is not the history of the real. 

12. 
Which world is this anyway? My life is getting smaller. I wait for a slow 
wind to meander through the room, the roof to burst, evaporate, silently, 
perfectly, as if it were never there at all.

Net Sentience


I want to go over, again, issues of Net sentience, emergent intelligence, 
which I find impossible, given the current configuration of the network. 
So please bear with me. Consider this as "why the Internet can't think."

First, beyond echo, there is no looping in the structure. There is hand- 
shaking among the computers, and reports on successful/unsuccessful 
transmission of packets, but there is no complex/holarchic organization. 
In fact, looping leads to black holes, to breakdown.

Second, the transmission is in the form of packets. Packets are sent 
independently of one another from site to site, reassembled at the site. 
They cannot act together in the midst of transmission.

Third, the Net utilizes the old NSF-backbone; everything is done to 
simplify connectivity. Neural networks rely on multiply-connected and 
interacting model neurons ("neurodes"); in the human brain, a neuron is 
directly and continuously connected to 10,000-100,000 others.

Fourth, the Net uses five protocol levels simultaneously, each encapsul-
ating the others; this creates a situation of "inertia" at the stage of
the symbolic (interpreted as content by the user - for example, the text
of an email post). Note that the text has _no relation_ to the underlying 
protocol structure. There is a deep division between content and network. 
Here is where confusion arises; community and community's interacting 
vis-a-vis message bases on the Internet do not constitute the level of 
interactivity that would be necessary for Net sentience. 

Fifth, there is no thresholding involved (with the exception of resending 
packets for a specified length of time, then reporting error messages if 
they do not get through). There is, in other words, no conceivable model 
of neural networks within the TCP/IP transmissions.

Sixth, on the other hand, sixth hand, the development of intelligent
search and filtering agents will leads to the implantation of neural
networking programs _on_ the Net, just as there are already intelligent
agents/bots on the MOOs and IRC. There is no reason why these would not
eventually become sentient (we're talking a decade or so), communicating
with one another. This leads to the notion of ENTITY spanning the wires,
not "in" them. 

In Naturally Intelligent Systems, Caudill and Butler define the following 
characteristics of neural networks; my comments follow in brackets:

1. A neural network is composed of a number of very simple processing 
elements that communicate through a rich set of interconnections with 
variable weights or strengths. [The processing elements of the Net are 
task-specific, complex, and use a very rich set of over 100 protocols, 
which do not have variable weights. Eventually a priority weighting may 
be instituted, determining the speed of transmission of specific mes- 
sages.] 

2. Memories are stored or represented in a neural network in the pattern 
of variable interconnection weights among the neurodes. Information is 
processed by a spreading, constantly changing pattern of activity 
distributed among many neurodes. [Memories are address bases at best, for 
routing. _Transmission_ is processed by a spreading...]

3. A neural network is taught or trained rather than programmed. [TCP/IP 
is programmed, not taught or trained.]

4. Instead of having a separate memory and controller, plus a stored 
external program that dictates the operation of the system as in a 
digital computer, the operation of a neural network is implicitly 
controlled by three properties: the transfer function of the neurodes, 
the details of the structure of the connections among the neurodes, and 
the learning law the system follows. [The Internet uses the stored 
external program model.]

5. A neural network naturally acts as an associative memory. That is, it 
inherently associates items it is taught, physically grouping similar 
items together in its structure. [Intelligent address routing may be
a possibility, using roaming agents to determine the fast path from site 
to site, depending on the health of the Net. Beyond this, associative 
memory plays little role in the organization of the Net.]

6. A neural network is able to generalize; it can learn the character- 
istics of a general category of objects based on a series of specific 
examples from that category. [This does not occur in any way on the Net.]

7. It is highly fault tolerant, or "fail soft." This characteristic is
sometimes also called "graceful degradation." A neural network keeps
working even after a significant fraction of its neurodes and inter-
connections have become defective. [This is true of the Net, and is the
major characteristic of TCP/IP, which is designed to continue working 
even if specific sites go under.]

8. A neural network innately acts as a processor for time-dependent 
spatial patterns, or spatiotemporal patterns. [This applies as well, 
considering the formatting and reassemblage of packets.]

9. A neural network can be self-organizing. [The Net is not self-organ- 
izing.]

(Some characteristics abridged.) It seems to me that intelligence will 
appear through neural networking approaches, rather than hard-wired, 
hard-weighted approaches; in any case, these more mobile architectures 
are coming into AI with real results. (The cockroach program I mentioned 
a while ago is based on a neural network.) The brain, any brain, uses 
somewhat similar but more complex systems; the Internet, however, does 
not. The Internet is redundant, but uses fixed programs, protocols, to 
ensure transmission. Intelligence may be _on_ the Net, may travel the 
Net, but the Net itself is passive, as passive as the phone system.

If this is the case, why does the spectre of Net sentience keep getting
raised here and elsewhere? I believe this is because of user interaction,
the amazing communality that develops on a human/languaging level. We tend
to believe that there is mind simultaneously within and beneath the words
(just as poetry and incantation carry a weight beyond the facticity of
protocol statements), that the mind is growing, and somehow manifest or
imminent. We also tend to believe in over-minds, even now, an inheritance
from science fiction (and religious transcendentalism), that there is a
Spirit which communicates with us, and that it is everywhere, in the midst
of our speech itself. Because the Internet is a multiply-connected global 
network, because it appears inexhaustible and an open architecture on the 
level of the user, it appears to be the (immanent) site for something 
else, something "driving it" ... This is, however, a result of our own 
projections/introjections (what I've called "jectivity" elsewhere), not a 
reality; much as we may desire it, Net sentience is better left to our 
minds and future bots.

Listen to this, Travis:


"In reality we ourselves make cinema by living it: that is, by existing
practically; that is, by acting. _All of life, in the whole of its
actions, is a natural, living, cinema: in this, it is linguistically the
equivalent of oral language in its natural and biological dimension._ 
   By living, therefore, we represent ourselves, and are present at the
representation of others. The reality of the human world is nothing other
than this double representation in which we are both actors and specta-
tors: a gigantic happening, if you like." (Pasolini, Empirismo eretico, in
Pier Pasolini, Naomi Greene, Cinema as Heresy.)

And this:

"Cinema is not a universal or primitive language system ('langue') nor
even a language ('langage'). It brings forth an intelligible matter, which
is like a presupposition, a condition, a necessary correlation through
which language constructs its own 'objects' (unities and signifying opera-
tions)." (Gilles Deleuze, Cinema II, quoted in Greene.)


What's the matter in cyberspace? Listen in any case:


Travis sat down facing the terminal.
He could hear the sea lapping on distant shores.

welcome to the pavilions of stuttering speech
the beginning of the mouth of the message
he had left cyberspace unannounced
no-announcement is a preparation
a preparation is always lost

his fingertips were damaged through hours of practice at the 
glass-harmonica 
it was a case of nerves as the bowls spun in their wooden frame
it was his habit his touch with something other than the keyboard
it sat in the corner an eighteenth century memory of his future

the lights blinked ceaselessly as he began the slow descent in the midst 
of the starfield
he thought to himself that sometime he would have to begin the process of 
memory
for what is the vain endeavor of the paysage of faces and lanterns

Travis thought of stars.
He thought of the matter of stars, enormous, inchoate, all culture's 
reversion to the molecular, along the fringes of solar storms.
He opened his mouth to speak but he had nothing to say.
The lanterns were beautiful and so were the illuminated faces.
He couldn't speak.

Carefully Read Before Anything Else!


... "whereas our whole art struggles to enforce the 'life,' the 'reality'
of fictive beings, the very structure of Japanese restores or confines
these beings to their quality as _products,_ signs cut off from the alibi
referential par excellence: that of the living thing." (Barthes, Empire of
Signs.)

To be sure, by way of a _necessary introduction,_ a capital surmounting 
the column of prose, to which I dedicate this post, from henceforth until 
two days following, write in and be included!

Fortune: You will become involved with the person who has written you the 
very text post; my lover frames it with the following post. If this is, 
in other words, post x, be assured that your future partner has written 
x+1, and that my current partner is to be found, alas, separated from 
me, in x+2. 

However, I am owed a great deal of money by the individual who has written
the _post before last_ - just so you know who you're dealing with... 

And happiness becomes me! Three posts down, immediately following my 
current partner at x+2, please note: My child has written a first post to 
the Internet! As a proud father, I am sharing this with you; please 
forgive my immodest behavior in this instance!

Alas, three posts before this, at unlucky x-3 (and luck always comes in 
threes!), the cause of my death - decades from now. Read back three 
posts, and all will be revealed...

But again, what concern is that of yours? It is _this very post_ that 
tells of _your_ good fortune, future happiness, and a life filled with 
joyous accomplishments!

I salute you!

Alan!

My quoting of text presaging the future presence of cyberspace - the
trace, filigree, found in these older works - as if disembodiment, era-
sure, effacement, distantiation, presencing, introjection and projection,
had an uneasy relationship to the future imaginary - the quotes from
everywhere and nowhere at all, magic, fetishization, unexplainable phen-
omena, all moving from the explanatory realm, hurtling towards the elec-
tronic highway, destination unknown, lanterns and ghosts, shimmering for
ests curtseying as the car disappears, the passengers holding the reins -
 

It's this kind of note that seeds a text, frames it at the level of the
curtain rod opening onto a senseless space. The space is as shallow as the
Net is shallow, not infinite information by a long shot, but selected
tropes depending upon the taste of someone carrying a book or document into
the electronic. I am aware of Ovid, the Icelandic Runic Poem, Lucan,
Kraus, Old Hittite, the Rig Veda, Manning on four-dimensional space, the 
list, irregular as can be, goes on and on. And I search for these roots, 
Barthes' writing on Japanese (which he probably got wrong) lending itself 
towards cybermind, this or that mathematics, Jabes, Bharata, Blake and 
Chatterton, all as if haunted, presaging...

And it's not that I trace these texts as historic curiosities, but instead
as a book of emblems constituting the discourse of cybermind itself, which 
did not begin with the Internet, won't end with it...

Alan, clarifying, thinking out loud -
