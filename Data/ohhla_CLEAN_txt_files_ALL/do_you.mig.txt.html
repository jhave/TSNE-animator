Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro:]
Do you like drugs?
Have you ever felt alone?
Do you still believe in love?

[Hook:]
But do you like drugs, do you like drugs
Yeah, Well me too, me too, me too babe
Me too, me too
Do you like Love, do you like love?
Yeah Well me too, me too
Its what we gonna do

[Verse 1:]
What about matinee movies, morning secrets
Midnight summers, swim private beaches
Rock, paper, scissors, wait best out of 3
My mama said the greatest things in life are free
What about lust, what about trust
What about love? she said, you know that I do
Oh you do baby, hope you do now
You do, do, do, do

[Hook:]
But do you like drugs, do you like drugs
Yeah Well me too, me too, me too
Me too, me too
Do you like love? Do you like love?
Well me too, me too
Its what we gonna do

[Verse 2:]
Tonight, so lets dance a little harder
Till I feel like I know
All the things

[Hook:]
Do you like drugs, do you like drugs..
Well me too, me too, me too
Me too
Do you like hugs? do you like love?
Feel like we got so much in common now
Right about now baby
Me too, me too
Its what we gonna do
Its you and me tonight
Tonight, you and me tonight
Tonight, you and me tonight
You and me tonight
You and me tonight
You and me yeah, tonight
You and me tonight, oh
Feel like Ive known you for so long
Right about now baby, yeah, yeah
I wanna do you like drugs tonight
Wanna do you like drugs, oh oh...</pre>
