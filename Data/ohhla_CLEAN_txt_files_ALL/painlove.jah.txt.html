[Chorus: Ja Rule]
Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain why
Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain why

[Ja Rule]
I sit alone in my four cornered room staring at candles
Gettin hot tryin to handle, this hand that's been dealt to me
I don't need, especially in this world overwhelmed with greed
See we cut from a different tree
Y'all niggaz hope and I wish a nigga would fuck with INC
Went through the troubles and the struggle of hustlin and runnin (what)
So the ones that come behind don't' run through nothin
They would fear no man but God and do a lot of frontin
And I'm here to tell the world that pain is lovin'
Like when I die I hope it rains
Cuz if it does, that mean the lord shared them niggaz pain
Here lie our man slain
And I would get out the game if I could
But I promised all my life to my kids I'd make good
Can't stand my father and love my momma
STILL I TRY, God can you explain why

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule]
I live my life under pistol, cuz lately love ain't been a issue
With who's gone miss you, when you dead and gone
Will my name live on? Or will I be the last to die and breathe and eat
Cuz I need a little love and affection and baby
I live like every day was my last one
Dang, I've been living my life... (haha, yea)
Like I'm a leave this world unmarked, smiles combed to horror
For all them days when it rains
And it feels like thangs ain't gettin no better for me
Nobody loves me, sometimes I wish God could come down and hug me
And wipe the tears from eyes
Cuz in my heart I know only the strong survive
And I die for my family, so they can live a better life
I try, God can you explain why

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule]
I'll sacrifice my life, fuck all the dumb shit
Cuz being black and broke's gettin redundant
My grow to be a world leader like X and King
If I can live a longer than Pac and BIG
What do river for us niggaz run red, you could tell by the lives we live
If it changes it'll be God's prediction, so pain inflicted, like Jane's Addiction
Live right like Christians, but dance with the death
It's like callin' stones a devil, the road is unlevel
Still I walk through the valleys of shadows of death gasping for air
Breathe in my last breath
My daughter told me first words, my son walked his first steps
And all through life we anticipate death
And if pain is truly love, for my family I DIE, God can you explain why

[Chorus]</pre>
