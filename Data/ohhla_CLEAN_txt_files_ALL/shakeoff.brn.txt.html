[Lyrics Born, spoken]
Man I keep having these nightmares
Won't leave me alone
I can't get a good night's sleep for the life of me
It's just so much drama
personal - professional - in the world
I need your help
Help deliver me from these
Hear me out, now

[Lyrics Born]
My woman left me out to twist in the wind
She just left on a whim
And ain't nothin I can do about it
She left me with a fistfull of bills
Not a crisp dollar bill
What the hell am I gon' do about it
We had our differences but I can't believe
This is how she would leave
We ain't even get to speak about it
Eleven minutes, seven hours and a week
That's when I was last asleep
It's When she left me, come to think about it

[Lyrics Born] (Joyo Velarde) *Repeat 2x*
One time (Shake it off)
Two times (Shake it off)
Three times (Shake it off)
(These bad dreams)

[Lyrics Born]
The other night ago the boss called me late
Wants to talk bout some thangs
Monday morning come and see about it
I feel it y'all my job's about to go
Feelin throbs in my skull
Oh my god i couldn't sleep about it
He told be lately that I'm lost on my tracks
Gonna cost me my job
Is there something we can do about it?
This motherfucker's got the balls to complain
After all that I gave
Said do what you gotta do about it

[Lyrics Born] (Joyo Velarde) *Repeat 4x*
One time (Shake it off)
Two times (Shake it off)
Three times (Shake it off)
(These bad dreams)

[Joyo Velarde] *Repeat 2x*
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take

-scratching- (Joyo Velarde)
<one...two...three...>
<one...two...three...>
<one...two...three...>(these bad dreams)
<one...two...three...>(these bad dreams)

[Lyrics Born]
Every night I toss and turn in my sleep
And it hurts when I breathe
And I'm gettin a little worried bout it
The combination of the stress and the strain
I ain't slept now for days
And I just can't get my head around it
With all the drama in the world that we live
Will we learn how to give?
I can't sit back and do nuttin bout it
I wanna know whatever happened to love
And compassion and drugs
'Cause it seem like we forgot about it

[Lyrics Born] (Joyo Velarde) *Repeat 4x*

One time (Shake it off)
Two times (Shake it off)
Three times (Shake it off)
