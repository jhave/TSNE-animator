[Intro: Michele van der Aa]
Hey baby, it's me
Just calling to say goodnight
And to send you congratulations
And babe, I love you and I miss you
Hope you have a good night, tonight
I might try calling you again in 20 minutes
But otherwise I'm going to bed, alright?
I'll talk to you tomorrow, bye babe

* Salah Edin speaking in Arabic *

[Roger Peterson]
I love you...

[Hook: Cilvaringz]
You're all that I need, I'll be there for you
If you keep it real with me, I'll keep it real with you
Loving your whole steeze, everything about you
On top of that, you always will keep it true, come on
You're all that I need, I'll be there for you
If you keep it real with me, I'll keep it real with you
Loving your whole steeze, everything about you
Let's go ahead and walk these dogs, and represent Wu, girl

[Cilvaringz]
I saw your eyes and fell in love on the spot
For all the beauty was mine, whether appearence or not
Hold by your fragrance, like the wines of Babylon and strong
Equality, eyes green like cheetahs of Lebanon
Queen, a king's daughter, bathings in the water
Your body caressed by sweet oils; divine woman
You can't even imagine what I feel for you, I'll kill for you
Forever shall I kneel to you, God
Answer my prayers, with a beauty beyond senses
And I will do anything for your love and happiness
You're so intelligent, quite humble and elegant
Make everything around me look so irrelevant
In my dreams, we used to kiss by the tree
And the purity of your lips, cooled the blush from my cheeks
Remember that, baby? (Michele: Yes, baby, I still do)
Remember when I came down to your town and said;

[Chorus 2X: Roger Peterson (Michele van der Aa)]
I love you (yes, I know)
I love you (I know, I know, I know)
I love you (yes, I will)
I love you (the will to love you)

[Cilvaringz]
So in the eyes of the beholder, creator of all
You came forth from the congo in Hong Kong
I was live, with the RZA on stage, doing my politics
It was the thing that would consolidate our minds and get
Stronger by the will of God, I fell in love
Deeply, you were kind and you would teach me
You were beautiful and true full supporter of beats
You sympathized with my people in the Middle East
And though we spend most our times apart
We would call every day and you would conquer my heart
I praise God for you come into my life, as my wife
But if you die once, that means I die twice
Always supportive to my music and dreams
Always understand the things are more difficult than they seem
Always by my side, your eyes, supreme, your smile, so kind
Your mind, my queen

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook]
