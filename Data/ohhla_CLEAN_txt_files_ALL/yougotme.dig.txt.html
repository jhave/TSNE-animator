Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
When you thinkin' bout the past starin' through the rear view mirror, mirror, mirror
Know I got you all through the pain
And I got you and that'll never change. No
You never cry when your with me
But don't worry cause you got me now. (Yeah you got me now)
You got me now. Ohhh

[Verse 1]
Hey Mrs. Beautiful there's somethin that you need to know
All your thoughts of past pain they need to go
I know its difficult and keepin your mind up may be hard
But know that I got you until the end, not only the start
So don't be lookin' behind you
Only to the future so hurt will never come find you
Tell me why your cryin' boo
No need to rewind back
To all of the times that
You been nevermind that
Cause it be hurtin' me probably close to as bad as it hurts you
My love is so strong that I cant subdue
All that you've been through
But its all right now
Cause every bad thought I will turn around

[Chorus]
When you thinkin' bout the past starin' through rear view mirror, mirror, mirror
Know I got you all through the pain
And I got you and that'll never change. No
You never cry when your with me
But don't worry cause you got me now
You got me now. Ohhh

[Verse 2]
Trust me when I say this
Never again
Will you gotta live a day when you gotta spend
Ya time being disrespected by the wrong man
Your my queen so I got some different things planned
For our future together we will never be severed
We're an inseparable force girl I'm with you forever
Your my only and ever
Keepin' you happy is a pleasure
Nothin' can measure or to me even be better
They see in those beautiful eyes
Great when you smile
Or when you blush so hard you put your head down
Its more than that you are the baddest around
Your a phenomenal person that I'm so happy I found

[Chorus]
When you thinkin' bout the past starin' through the rear view mirror, mirror, mirror
Know I got you all through the pain
And I got you and that'll never change. No
You never cry when your with me
But don't worry cause you got me now
You got me now. Ohhh</pre>
