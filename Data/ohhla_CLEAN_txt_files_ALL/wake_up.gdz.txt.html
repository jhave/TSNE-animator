[Chorus 3X: Frukwan]
Better wake up
Better wake up
Now's the time
You better wake up, yo!

[Poetic]
Yo, yo, aiyo
My country tis of thee, bloodshed and misery
Ain't nobody givin me, liberty, New York City
Be makin it, hard to cope God
They even built a bulletproof benz for the Pope
Hard screens, group piece to hang loose
Off of a noose, of a rope in a tree
And still we supposed to see
Equality especially these days, when we gotta fight
Just to waste our equality of life
See urb' children hung a pain cut like a knife
No dome for the lights, in a room full of cockroach' and mice
Dad runnin out of ways of fixin the hot water pipes
Bad plumbin, storms comin, the wind's hummin
The Farrenheit tonight is 32 degrees, Tony please
Wake up, go help ya pop fix the boiler
I hand him the tools outta the box
I watched doin the knowledge to the look in his eyes
Ate lies to protect, four sons, one daughter
And his wife, her father, and plus himself
I didn't comprehend back then, he was teachin me
How to survive in the cold world's refrigerator
I'm bein chased by the queen later
As I collect supreme data, as a teenager
The unseen danger of bein a crew chaser
It seems major, green papers
Causes gray hairs, blood sweat and tears for long years
Mom said "You gotta be strong, dear, press on, dear
The load is heavy but it's still one that you can bear"
As the tear rolled off her cheek, nothin to eat
She's makin miracles wit some flour and some heat
No meat, it's aight mom, I'm vegetarian
Half boar, half humanitarian

[Chorus 2X]

[Frukwan]
Burnin buildings, abandoned children
Splashed drinks, addicted fiends
Drop outs, cop outs, of nicotine
Sittin back and think how keen that it will be
Reverse the spinnin of Earth to Adam &amp; Eve
Day one, 445 apart
Feel it in ya heart, cuz it's so for real
In the mind, it develops and becomes the deal
Like my universal flag, everything's complete
Thinkin I ain't God, look and you shall see
But you won't, for so many fools that tried
To search for mysterious God and I
Thinkin back as a slave, wildin in them J's
Wit thoughts of bein free, was never the same
Some commited suicide, cuz times was harsh
And the ones who survived that got brainwashed
From lightnin, thunder, hail storm
I can never forget, I be a Gatekeep, Frukwan
Even thru my name, history will burst
Cuz I'm the maker, the owner, the cream of the planet Earth
Father of civilization, God of the universe
Yo slave is slave, that's why I they call that
Cuz the 85%'s yo, and that's a fact
They be wonderin why they eat so much pork
Cuz it taste so good, and that's how they was taught
Bein brought up in a world of Christianity
By your mother, and your father, most of ya family
We go to Church every Sunday, like you never did before
Gotta learn about someone that you never saw
The preacher is a mason of the highest degree
That's why I ain't have to go under Allah's study
The rabbis and the minester's are keepin ya blind
So you can die wit them in the last day and time
Like a child is born, wit no state of mind
And bein blind from the ways of mankind
But when you look up in the sky and all you see is blue
Yo, that's caused by the sun and the water too
Tell us, why the Devil does not teach us that
Cuz the black man is God, and that's a fact
Yo, original man was here ever since the day one
And that's when you can say, the Earth had begun
Cuz within the Earth, yo, exist today
The wisest group of indiviuals that always stay
And they are known, what, as the 5%
And for one, let me tell you, that's what I represent
So niggas out there, in a world of confusion
Powerful eyes of Allah will see ya execution

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
