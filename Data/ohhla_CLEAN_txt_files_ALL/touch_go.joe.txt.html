Joey, uhh...
Uh, one question

Now who rep Jersey like me?
Baby few dudes ain't worthy like me
You know I keep somethin pretty by me
Good pair of frames, Polo white tee
Y'all see somethin with a body have her my queen
Extra small waist, top lookin like D's
Y'all don't cuff 'em or make 'em wifey
Cause you ain't Coco and I ain't Ice T
So it's unlikely, I trick on her tryin to ball
Tattoo on her back said China Doll
Joey! Talk to 'em like Imus y'all
And give head to a brother, need a Tylenol
And let's keep what we do on the low
No entourage, just a one-man show
Let's break out from the club around 4
But it's just one thing that a nigga must know
Can we

[Chorus]
Touch, go, touch and go
Touch, go, touch and go
Touch and go, touch, go
Touch, go, touch and go - HERE WE GO!
(She said she had a man but so)
(There's just one thing that I really must know - can we)
Touch and go, touch, go
Touch, go (can we) touch and go  HERE WE GO!

[Joe Budden]
I mean I've been seen the broad, you just met her
I'm in the 'tel with her, you just text her
You just chase her, you just sweat her
She played you out, you just let her
You just peck her, you protect her
I don't even understand them gestures
I undress her, throw her on the dresser (and)
Normally the room like like Esther
But if she act up, gotta check her
R.L. +Next+ her, that's just my regular
Et cetera, my service like Federer
The Rodger cat, now do you roger that?
Let's keep what we do on the low
No entourage, just a one-man show
Let's break out from the club around 4
But it's just one thing that a nigga must know
Can we

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
How you doin tonight?
Matter fact, what you doin tonight?
If the answer's nothin
I'm hopin us two could get into somethin
So let me know what you doin tonight
Or, maybe I'm what you doin tonight
Call me up naked when she home alone
And make the tone long, now that's the phone bone
Look  I ain't gotta compliment you
Uhh, me bein me compliments you
So on the balcony or in the tub
On the plane join the Mile High Club
From the club to the bathroom stall
Whenever we'll hook up she ain't wearin no drawers
Ooh baby I likes it raw
But keep that behind closed doors, my door

[Chorus]  2X</pre>
