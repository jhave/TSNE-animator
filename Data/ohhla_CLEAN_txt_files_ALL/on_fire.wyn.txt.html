[Chorus]
Mama bad
Mama mean
Gasoline
She's on fire
Put her out
As a matter of fact
Take her out
Cause she's on fire

Got on my knees 
And asked my Lord to keep me clear from the devil cause my girl
She's she's on fire
Yeah now everything so cool
Yeah

[Verse One]
Now gimme them back shots
I want them back shots
I said shorty let me play up in them matchbox
Shorty she's on fire
Shorty let a nigga rub this stick against this matchbox
She's steaming
She's screaming
She's she's screaming
She's fiending 
I redeem it
I get between it 
Like a, like a remix
Now hit me
Now she's on fire
Yeah, I let the steam blow
But everything is cool

[Verse 2]
Uh
She hot as hell lets call her Helen
Fireman to her rescue like 9-11
Fuckin' right I make her hot
She got the Devil in her
I do whatever with her
Hells angel
I pluck her feathers nigga
I am the fire spitter
I start a fire with her
Ok her flames high 
But I am higher nigga
So high so I invite her up
Then I light her up
Uh

[Chorus]
Mama bad
mama mean
Kerosene
She's on fire
Put her out
As of matter of fact
Take her out
(Cause she's on fire)
Got on my knees and ask my lord to keep me clear from the devil cause my girl
She, she's on fire 
Yeah now everything so cool

Now hear it
She's on fire
Yeah
(She's on fire)
I let the steam blow
Yeah, And now 
(She's on fire)
