I'ma thug
I'ma shoot
I'ma smoke
I'ma walk up on yo ass and bust yo ass in the eye
I'ma roll this blunt up
I'ma I'ma

Chorus:
I'ma ride 2 da end (end)
Ball till I fall (fall)
I'm on the hunt for tha papa
Gimme s'more
I gotta get mine (hey)
All about the currency (yea)
And let my thugs and mutha fuckin' rydas represent me (woop woop)

And ya betta blaze the weed
And pass that shit to me
And I'ma cock da gat
And hold it down for my family
We worldwide
Leaving ya hatin' bitches
On the curbside
Bleeding and needin' stiches
Bitches ya got ya mouth wide open
On the wed and all your hatin' and roastin
Gonna keep me braggin' and boastin'
This shit is coast to coast
And I'ma ball till I fall baby
While punk ass bitches
Spend they money on that car neday
You can't even picture me rollin'
Money follin'
In an Escalade with twinkies and it's
Probably stolen
Crack my Newports, open
And I'm smokin' for a lickin'
If you got it
And I want it
Then you hittin'
You and your bitch
Foe Foe
Mister Mean And Hateful
Mister Free to ride
You and your fam
Can burn the cradle
Who wanna smoke?
Who wanna ride wit me?
We runnin wit da Rydas
Till the E-N-D
And I'ma

Chorus
(Yayeah)
Hit the east side
Intended to get groovy
Cruisin down the Ave.
Lookin' for titties and booties
Guerellis grippin' twinkies
See me sparklin' and shinin'
I'm like a diamond
As I continue glidin'
The ass drops down
As I hit the switch again
Heads startin' turnin'
Cuz they see that Shank is perfen
And swervin'
Pimpin
Please understand that if these niggas act up
They get ta leavin' in an ambulance
I got my hand curved around a heata
And if your bitch is on my dick
Hell yea I wanna meet her
I'ma playa
You don't see them diamonds through the windshield?
I'm eatin' steak and shrimp while you bitches splitten happy meals
Don't get your cat peeled
Actin' hard
I got a bullet for you
And everybody in your backyard (What the fuck you looking at)
And bitch if you don't know
You better ask a friend
L'il Shank Mutha fucka, I'ma ryda till the end

Chorus

Do I gotta tell you how much
That this watch cost?
Or do I gotta tell you how much dope a nigga lost?
Tryin' to come up in the game
Make a name for myself
But when this block get hit
It's hella bad for ya health
Gotta get back on your feet
Hustle on the street
Minimum wage don't make enough for ends meet
What's up bitch?
The name's Cell Block, ho
And one question, do you like dick in the throat? (FUCK YEA)
I be rollin with the rydas
Iced out on the street
Gold chain around my neck
Brand new NIKE's on my feet
And we livin' up yo block
Nigga always wit a glock
And a sack fulla rocks
For them thieves on my jock
Keep rockin' skrilla
Paper chasin' never ends
I be 45 and still slangin' rocks out the benz
I'ma pimp by blood
And a Ryda 4 Life
And I'ma ride 2 da end
Dumpin' clips all night

Chorus X2
(rydas)
And let my thug and mutha fuckin' rydas represent me
Uh...Bullet in this bitch, Cell Block, Fo Fo, L'il Shank, Full Clip
And let my thug and mutha fuckin' rydas represent me</pre>
