[Schoolly D]
Fast and steady, I'm like a jet plane
So many rhymes in my brain
So many things, complex
Waitin to see what School, will do next
All the while, you've been waitin
like a child, aggravatin
for Schoolly School, to come along
to put a dope beat into a rap song
I know, it's quite absurd
Like a school, I used to be a verb
but now I'm a bill, on Capitol Hill
So now, sit back and chill
Thinkin, a picture of Jesus
In my mind, I know that he need this
Tryin to hold back with all my might
I know damn well, he wasn't white
I look into the mirror, I say damn
Jesus was a Black Man

{interlude}

[Schoolly D]
Don't know where I'm goin, or where I'm from
All I really know is that I carry a gun
I keep dancin, to this rhythm
Don't know, just what I give em
Performin, an excism
Sit on back and listen, to my wisdom
You scream, dance you might holler
At the door cash money that dollar
Come on in, treat me like your father
Beats so dope, they grabbed you by the collar
This poem's, a lethal weapon
You don't tickle, keep on steppin
Schoolly School, too damn cool
Dope beats and dope rhymes RULE
Reach into my pocket, I say damn
cause Jesus was a Black Man</pre>
