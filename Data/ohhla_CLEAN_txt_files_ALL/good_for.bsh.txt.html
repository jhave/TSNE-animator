[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
It's all on me, I identify you
Lookin' ziplock fresh, girl, you stay on your tools

Rubberband full of cake, girl, you know I'm the worst (Worst)

[Verse 2: Baby Bash {Baby Bash *slowed down*}]
Spend it in Atlanta, girl, spend it in L.A.
New York City, girl, big bombay
Neon lights with the champagne flights
Ringside tickets to the big top fights {*ding ding ding*}
You know you wanna live
You know you wanna see it
You know you tell your girlfriends, you know they won't believe it {Hold up}
Hold up, I'm just sayin', though

Fettucinni, love to see me
Work for my candy, I'm a let 'em know

Repeat Chorus

On Tha Cool, she baby boo, and I'm a let her wear my chain
New Gucci shoes, new Gator blues, new platinum diamond rang
New whips, she could swang
Shoppin' spress out in Spain
Mi corazon, so you know it's on, cause money ain't a thang

Repeat Chorus
