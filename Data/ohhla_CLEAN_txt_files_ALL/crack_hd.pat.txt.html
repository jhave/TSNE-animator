[Chorus]
We ain't out here claimin' killer but we will, crack a head
CRACK A NIGGA HEAD! CRACK A NIGGA HEAD!
Naan one of y'all suckers wanna get some of this
CRACK A NIGGA HEAD! (we'll) CRACK A NIGGA HEAD!
We ain't out here claimin' killer but we will, crack a head
CRACK A NIGGA HEAD! CRACK A NIGGA HEAD!
Naan one of y'all suckers wanna get some of this
CRACK A NIGGA HEAD! (we'll) CRACK A NIGGA HEAD!

[Verse 1]
I'm throwin' Project hood haymakers, in the club, on the block
Swangin' 'til ya fall, then I stomp you wit' my Reeboks
Haters used to laugh when I was po', well chuckle this
Nothin' but, very chapped lips, chasin' knuckle fist
Knuckle this, up, in ya mind when you was lookin' mean
Hit him in his face, eyes rolled like a slot machine
All up in the club, nigga talkin' caught one in the throat
Fist to his windpipe, that was all, that she wrote
Hate to see it happen, but believe me, that it will
Violate us dog and, blood is, gonna spill
You gon' get some ackrite, reachin' for my Henn' bottle
Slap you in yo' dome, it'll send you right into tomorrow

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You young punks need to walk, off in si-o-lence
Bump into me, and experience some of this vi-o-lence
I'm raisin' chairs up and send ya head into concussion
Some nigga dissed North Memphis so we had to rush him
Talk all that noise, but you boys are some ??? lugs
You shall get beat down clown, by guerilla lugs
Some street raised but some knuckle punch, skilly lugs
Don't be amazed sayin' what you gonna do to us
'Cause we ain't takin' threats, layin' bets on who we whuppin'
If he got beat wit' one, all of us gonna whup him
Ya gal chose, so we manned, up like game time
Over a broad, you is bouts, to get flatlined

[Chorus]
