[Intro]
Fuck, fuck you, fuck you, fuck him
Fuck everything else I can see
I know, fuck you I hate you so fucking much
I know you think I'm crazy
Cause I think you're a fucking fag

[TC]
Sam the music sounds good man!
You've been practicing

[Sam]
Thanks

[TC]
Sam, this is Wolf
He's new here

[Sam]
Sup dude

[TC]
Wolf this is Sam
Sam and his band have been here at Flog Gnaw for a while
Sam's gonna show you around
while I fill out these last minute field trip slips, alright?
Now you guys have fun

[Wolf]
So you guys are into jazz?

[Sam]
Look, Wolf, Prairie Dog, Dontelle
Whatever the fuck your name is
We don't fuck with you or anybody else here, alright?
You stay the fuck out of our way and we'll stay out of yours
Capisce?</pre>
