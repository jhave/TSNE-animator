Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Hit niggaz off like Pepper Johnson
Oh, uh-oh, you ready L?  Aight, let's go
Uhh, uhh, uhh..

Ladies shout my name cause I'm sweet like sugar water
Some call me daddy cause I treat 'em like my daughter
They'll rush out my name and refer to me as Posi'
When I make love I come with like a kamikaze
I don't return 'til the mission is completed
And that's a treat when you're properly treated
Now don't - say I'm conceited, say I'm convinced
My momma called me nasty and I was ever since
At school they voted me the one most likely who would
But never realized that I'd be so damn good
Swift and interchangable, yet remaindable
Rhymes intoxicate ya when it spins on the turntable
And get you high, higher than a skyscraper
When I gets rough, it's rougher than sandpaper
The brother's still frontin, still front to flex
Wouldn't squeeze the trigger, on a bottle, of Windex
Uhh, and ya don't stop
