Go
Boom Boom Clap (12X)
Fre, Fre, Fre, Er, Fresh
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Chea...Let's Get It

[Chorus]
First I'm gone stack my flo' (and then what?)
Then I'm gone stack some mo' (and then what?)
Close shop then I do my count, hide the rest of the yams at my auntie house
(and then what?)
Get Fresh and jump in one of dem cars (yeah)
Hit the club and get one of dem broads (and then what?)
It's a wrap, we on the way to the house; by 3:45 I be kickin' her out (heyy)

Patty cake, patty cake, microwave
These suckas make a square, damn I'm paid (ha ha)
I'm so cool, but I'm so hot, and I'm, I'm so fly, and you, you're so not (nope)
Show me what you're workin' wit just like that (like that)
Turn around, bend over, bring it back (bring it back)
Slow Mannie, Mannie Fresh bring it back (bring it back)
It's Mannie Fresh and Snowman, it's a wrap
Wrapped up in the club, yeah I'm so crazy
These other rappers actors like Patrick Swayze (ha ha)
I tried to tell 'em but these niggaz ain't hearin' me
Mossberg Pump ridin' shotgun literally (daaamn)
Live from the projects, you know what it is
Ay, Snowman, (what up), can I get a ad lib?
Get the club crunk, can't take that from me
Ain't dropped yet, still got a lil' jon money

[Chorus]

I see ya lookin' (ha ha), with ya lookin' ass
Catch Snowman in the kitchen wit his cookin' ass (cheaa)
I'm so clean, but I'm so grindin' (alright), so dirty but yet, I'm so shinin'
Kiki B told me finish my meal, Def Jam, seven figures we can finish the deal (yeaaah)
Some say I lucked up, I call it perfect timing (yeah)
I can't lose, the whole city's behind me

Go
Boom Boom Clap (12X)
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Let's Get It

[Chorus]

I got million dollar dreams and federal nightmares (ay)
We pop Cris' my niggaz, and still drink beer (dat's riiight)
What did you expect man, I came from nothin' (nothin)
Real street nigga, wouldn't change for nothin'
Got my niggaz out the hood, it's such a wonderful feeling (chea)
Three car garage wit the twelve foot ceiling (ay)
It oughta be a crime just to feel this good
I swear it oughta be a crime just to be this hood (ayy)
