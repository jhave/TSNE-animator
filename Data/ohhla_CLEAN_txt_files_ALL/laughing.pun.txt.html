[Pun]
600 Benz 20 inch rims house on the hill hittin' mad skin
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
It was all a scheme i used to load the teck with the magazine 
so i was mean but i still had a scheme 
17 years young everything seemed fun 
still considered a veteran cause i feared none 
Pun's from the street where there aint no rules
but carried heat cause he ain't no fool 
Aint no wrong for dollars in negative digits
so debted followers and got rid of the quitters
that never forget us cause we've been down since the
Genesis 200 horse power  to 400 Pegasus
the messages don't sleep till its over 
next thing you know shorty seven feet
tippin' over i'm still in the water drownin'
Knights and murder till the immortal terror squad
threw me a life preserver now im ice forever
stomach bustin' out the white carrera 
life is better now niggas wanna rhyme together
ay que sera! what can i do but take you to strive
ay que hago! i hope the streets dont take me alive
you wasted your life and refused the struggle  while 
i aim for the sky pay dues and bubbles I WIN!

Chorus  

[Pun]
Now its not funny cause im hot and got a pot of money 
alot of hunnies around (Don't stop do the brown for me)
my every wish is her command call her bitch she understands
i reminisce how she used to dis me and my man
check part of the plan she told my son i wasn't the man
i aint gonna to stop till i got a heart in my hand
I can silence the lamb but couldn't silence her cause
she was as wild as a man with a bottle of liquor 
i'm not going to hit her i'm gonna debt her tonight
double platinum now shes one in the tribe well in the ride now
well in a fly gettin'  high now no more whiteout send the cubans 
to provide now  it's my world i demand my respect
give me your girl or get slapped in your neck
ain't nothin' change im still humble and modest
and im always proud to admit i came straight from the projects
hardy har har har

[Tony Sunshine]
Don't you forget about me now

Nah Nah Nah Nah....

Nah Nah Nah Nah.....Nah Nah Nah Nah
(*repeat 2x*)

[Tony Sunshine]
Don't you forget about me now
I said don't..don't...don't...don't
