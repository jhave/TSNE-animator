[Kool Keith]
Velvet robe, body like Hector Comacho
Kissin Puerto Rican girls on they earlobes
Victor Ramosa standin on Fermosa
Big whip, fat you own a orange Rolls Royce
Comin down Pico, up North Lenox
Heads with backpacks 
move like they try to act like they don't hear it
System bust, I don't rap freestyle no more
Stopped smokin angel dust
I bring drama to your tour bus, we comin all 800 of us
Project one, project two, project three
My Recena Houses, Jackson Houses, Webster Houses
How that sound to you mouses?
Jamaicans from ??, and Patterson Houses
"Lift up Star, Keith mon, let me know I'll cut 'is t'roat"
Other rappers standin around, jealous lookin broke
Need to be in double dutch, jumpin rope
Y'all Northtown folks - comin down to Manhattan World
Serious soul food made by black girls
Cornbread and beepers above your head
I'ma stop at the red light cause it's red

[Kool Keith]
Fascinatin with the quickness
I make models come to public housing and visit
That's how technical I get exquisite
Bangin on pipes
Lookin at cops walkin up the stairs with flashlights
Most MC's wearin leg-warmers and tights
I come with Dominican girls with bodies like Jennifer Lopez
Wearin tight shorts from Washington Heights
Ride first class with flights to Santo Domingo
with sombrero performin my single
with my hype-man Al Gringo
I'll watch you in the front cat don't let your face get wrinkled
Side effects miss you
Jump around you gonna need a napkin and a tissue
When I gross up the max you count the issue
Buy The Source cover for twelve months
and send other rappers over to pose
and take pictures for some potato chips and Cap'n Crunch
That's how I take suckers out to lunch
Forget the internet, the website, that's no way to step right
I ain't sittin by no computer, I'm goin to Bermuda
