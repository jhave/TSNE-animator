[Chorus - Young Dro]
Young Dro I ain't playin wit it (playin wit it)
Trunk got that Jackie Chan in it (Jackie Chan in it)
Sound like it got a band in it (got a band in it)
I'm the freshest in the Lamb' wit it (in the Lamb' wit it)
Y'all niggaz fugazzin it (fugazzin it)
Diamonds look like koolaid in it (like koolaid in it)
Different flavor Cartier wit it (Cartier wit it)
Big paint bitch play wit it (bitch play wit it)

[Verse 1]
I ain't playin.. IHOP blue Cutlass
24 inches... IHOP blue buttons
4-4 in my hand wit a snipe I'm armed Russian
Dro you from ATL nigga how you talk Russian?
Slugs start to bustin and my ammo got that serial
Catch a nigga slippin hit him in the equilibrium
SS Impala... shawty I'm darin 'em
Cartiers and Prada.. shawty I'm killin 'em
Look at my chain and my ice look triple blue
You poppin these nigga I'mma bring the triple through
And bitches be up on the block like "I'm sick of you"
And I'm like "bitch please I'm dickin you"
The 'vert Flipper blue the chirp bigger too
Hey picked out for a Bentley she a mini blue
Dropped in wit a bitch named Missy Pooh
Trunk bang and this the only thing she listen to
Dro

[Chorus - Young Dro]
Young Dro I ain't playin wit it (playin wit it)
Trunk got that Jackie Chan in it (Jackie Chan in it)
Sound like it got a band in it (got a band in it)
I'm the freshest in the Lamb' wit it (in the Lamb' wit it)
Y'all niggaz fugazzin it (fugazzin it)
Diamonds look like koolaid in it (like koolaid in it)
Different flavor Cartier wit it (Cartier wit it)
Big paint bitch play wit it (bitch play wit it)

[Verse 2]
Hey move through y'all tryna see how to do y'all
Chevy too tall I see a forehead and that's all
Two tone plus I'm on purple my yay's ???
My bitches bring blocks only thing I do is chirp 'em
Drop twerk 'em ostrich on my Chevy car interior
Plus I'm on that Remy so that shit make me imperial
Ridin down ??? no damage I'm serious
Plus I won't let a nigga have it I'm delirious
I'mma blast period don't question me don't mess wit me
Blue ice bue arm Superman recipe
Plus I'm in that brown Regal same color Nestle
Niggaz see me when I'm in the trey I be in tressa trees
Take the wrong step to me and death'll be yo destiny
I know how to do it so ain't nobody arrestin me
Polo I be dressin in man I be damagin
That fresh hoes be like "damn that's a mannequin"
Dro

[Chorus - Young Dro]
Young Dro I ain't playin wit it (playin wit it)
Trunk got that Jackie Chan in it (Jackie Chan in it)
Sound like it got a band in it (got a band in it)
I'm the freshest in the Lamb' wit it (in the Lamb' wit it)
Y'all niggaz fugazzin it (fugazzin it)
Diamonds look like koolaid in it (like koolaid in it)
Different flavor Cartier wit it (Cartier wit it)
Big paint bitch play wit it (bitch play wit it)

[Verse 3]
Hey summer time (summer time) look at my charm (look at my charm)
I'm iced out baby how can I be warm?
Watermelon Nova my trunk on Vietnam
TV's in the horn watchin Tip on VH-1
26's son wit a robocop gun
I'll blast a nigga from the ground to the sun
The sound of the gun that's when Young Dro chalkin it
Grape linen grape gatorfruit fruit walkin it
Know a nigga bossin it don't make me start chalkin it
I know how to shine cause my arm be on frostbit
Done son no shit my rides look like a parrot do
Know a nigga healthy cause my Cutlass look like carrot juice
Catch me when I'm mashin through I'm froze up I'm rolled up
Young Dro yeah but I am gotdamn Dro'ed up
Bout to put them doors up and crank that damn rose up
4:15 I'm bout to wake these damn hoes up
Dro

[Chorus - Young Dro]
Young Dro I ain't playin wit it (playin wit it)
Trunk got that Jackie Chan in it (Jackie Chan in it)
Sound like it got a band in it (got a band in it)
I'm the freshest in the Lamb' wit it (in the Lamb' wit it)
Y'all niggaz fugazzin it (fugazzin it)
Diamonds look like koolaid in it (like koolaid in it)
Different flavor Cartier wit it (Cartier wit it)
