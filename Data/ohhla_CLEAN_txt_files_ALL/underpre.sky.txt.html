[Intro - Sample from "Walk On By" by The Undisputed Truth]
If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry, each time we meet
Walk on byyyyy

[Skyzoo - talking over Intro]
To my other half
To my other half, huh

[Verse 1 - Skyzoo] (Sample)
To my other half or what used to be, what I used to know
How it used to seem and however it used to go
Never foresaw change as an all and all
But now I'm all for change, baby call this off (if you see me)
See my intentions were good with tryin to be in this
But I tried seein it and couldn't find me in it
And I was IDin it, lookin for a reason to fall back
But still daydreamin of call backs (if you see me)
I guess it was denial, I gave up the fight
Hopin you could downplay the down plays of my life
I sang "job well done", holdin banners in the stands
'Til you switched, now when I think of handin you a hand (if you see me)
I get, a little less enthused
'Cause everything should be the same if we've been true
But everything is rearranged and I'm lookin for a light switch
Wishin that I never had to write this
Knowin that (if you see me)

[Chorus - Skyzoo] - w/ ad libs
I'm tryin to be the best man that I can
But you fail to realize where I stand
And I'm, under pressure, the last thing I need
Is you tellin me, we can no longer be

Ma, I'm tryin to be the best man that I can
But you fail to realize where I stand
And I'm, under pressure and everything I do
I do for us two but you got me tryin to move

[Verse 2 - Skyzoo] (Sample)
They say you fear what you don't understand, try to bury it
And criticize the chances that you don't ever get
So from the outside scopin in
They look towards you to provide the hope for them (if you see me)
And they bein your friends, hate me yet again
But it's cool, 'cause none of them made me in the end
But as for you, I put you on a higher plane
So high it made it easier to fly away (if you see me)
See I ain't use no one opinion about you to out you
Never entertained a reason to ever doubt you
But leave it up to you to play follow along
They mad 'cause they don't have and you droppin it off (if you see me)
And the same ones callin you, sayin what you ought to do
Wasn't tryin to help you with everything that you thought you knew
And I felt for you, wishin I could be there
But no matter what I told you, you never really cared and (if you see me)

[Chorus - Skyzoo] - w/ ad libs
I'm tryin to be the best man that I can
But they fail to realize where I stand
And I'm, under pressure, the last thing I need
Is them tellin me, we can no longer be

Ma, I'm tryin to be the best man that I can
But they fail to realize where I stand
And I'm, under pressure and everything I do
I do for us two but they got me tryin to move

[Verse 3 - Skyzoo] (Sample)
He say, she say, they say, we say
Pointin fingers at anybody to earn leeway
All the things you didn't know but might've wondered
I was tryin to find an excuse to fight 'em under (if you see me)
I spent more time replyin instead of tryin
But could've spend half of that time and stopped lyin
Lyin to myself and tellin me what I wanna hear
Hopin it could erase the shit I've done in there (if you see me)
Heartbeat, runnin scared, outside, freezer box
Know I got the perfect but I still wanted to see what I could pull
So it was all tug a war
Missed calls replaced the rose petal covered floors (if you see me)
Miss Wrong, you was right and you deserve different
And yeah I work different but know that my hurt isn't
So no matter the weight, I'm willin to deal with it
And hopefully we still with it (if you see me)

[Chorus - Skyzoo] - w/ ad libs
'Cause I'm just really tryin to be the best man that I can
But I failed to realize where I stand
And I'm, under pressure, the last thing I need
Is me tellin me, we can no longer be

Ma, I'm tryin to be the best man that I can
But I failed to realize where I stand
And I'm, under pressure and everything I do
I do for us two but I got me tryin to move

[Outro - Skyzoo - talking] (Sample)
(If you see me)
To my other half
To my other half
To my other half
To my other half
(If you see me)
(If you see me)</pre>
