[Zack de la Rocha]
They say that in war the truth be the first casualty
So I, dig in selector, I, the resurrector
Fly my shit, sever your neck, wider than ever
With my, tongue dipped in funk arsenic
Burn this illusion, this lie with straight arson shit
Your arsenal stripped, power ain't full jackets and clips
It's, my ability to, define phenomenonal raw
Crenshaw '84, Boogie Down before
L.A. when the war break off
Where you be take off, stand-in full face off
With the M-1 millimeter, let the rhythm of the chamber hit 'em
Let the rich play catch with 'em
Better yet make 'em, eat 'em and shit 'em
'til they, so full of holes that they drown in their own
I'm like a, nail stuck in the wrist of they Christmas
Don't need radio, to leave they family a witness

[Chorus]
Muhammad and Christ, word life, would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert full of bullets let yo' body rot
With my chrome, with my verse, with my body rock
Both Muhammad and Christ would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert full of bullets let yo' body rot
With my chrome, with my verse...

[Zack de la Rocha]
In this era where DJ's, behave
Be paid to be slaves, we raid airwaves, to be sane
And, what's rainin, from the station
Cash fascination, like livin dead fed agents
Distract us fast, from a disaster's wrath for sure
Air war is flooded like the 9th Ward
On the AM, on the AM
Turn and face them, hatred and mayhem
Slay them, dangerous, I take razor steps
It's the swing from the bling, to the bang on the left
It's the murderous return, boom bap full strap
Your six that got clipped, you can't clap back
With minimal lift, and criminal flow
I'm killin them soft and billin them for, everything stole
And once again I'm that nail in the wrist of they Christmas
Watch me make they family a witness~!

[Chorus]
Muhammad and Christ, word life, would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert full of bullets let yo' body rot
With my chrome, with my verse, with my body rock
Both Muhammad and Christ would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert full of bullets let yo' body rot
With my chrome, with my verse, with my body rock

[Interlude]
International
International

[Chorus] - second version, echoes at end</pre>
