For the thugs
Yes sir, ha ha

Yes sir
My boy dooda, wa's up fool
(Down South)
Tut, ha ha haa
We've been seen (Aye yo C!), they on a roll 
hurry up nigga, come on, they got guns 
(I'm doin' this one for the thugs) 
They got big guns! 
They wanna go to war nigga 
Hah?(Yes sir, for the thugs) 
they don't wanna die, they don't mean that 
Hah 

[verse 1] 
If it wasn't for the Hennesey 
and thug livin' for my enemy 
my brother still be alive and apart of me 
so I, say a prayer for that playa 
and I, take my fire everywhere, see 
Its kinda hard when you missin' yo' dawgs 
another name on the wall 
they keep takin the fall 
yes I be livin though 
dead and gone befo' we twenty fo' 
or in jail but cha'll don't here me though 
is this world about to end 
if not then explain to me, how come I'm losin my friends 
and why I'm livin' wit my kid 
and why I'm fifty grand short from gettin' me a brand new benz 
its kinda hard for the black man 
I watch the million man march for the black man 
and through the sun and rain 
I love enjoyin' pain 
I know we be livin' strange but we'll maintain hey 

[chorus] 
I'm doin' this one for the thugs 
and the niggas on the corner sellin' drugs 
for the thugs yes sir 
For the thugs 
and the boys down south much love 
for the thugs yes sir 
For the thugs and the boys in the city much love 
for the thugs yes sir 
For the thugs 
and the dogs in the grove much love 

[verse 2] 
See, I, I, gotta called from the crib 
my dawg got killed 
gotta all my homies in tears 
and we don't know who the killas is 
it could of been the lick 
it could of been the hit 
I 'on't know we stayed in some shit so 
we put his face on a shirt 
and shedded tears for the game 
(a thug in memory boy) 
cuz it's hard to hide the pain 
they teach us some better thangs 
the shoes his mama a back cuz she could use the change 
thats how you ride for yo dogs, shit 
ride or roll take sides for yo dog 
suppose to die for your dogs, shit 
hard time in gangsta livin' 
and got us villian chillin' 
try to start no crossin' me and you so 
and you cry for yo' dogs 
Hell, I don't understand 
man, I say a prayer to all of y'all 
and for the cause 
for my motherfuckin' dogs 
Nigga! 

[chorus] 
I'm doin' this one for the thugs 
and the niggas on the corner sellin drugs 
for the thugs yes sir 
For the thugs 
and the niggas Overtown sellin' drugs 
for the thugs yes sir 
For the thugs 
and my Carol City niggas much love 
for my thugs yes sir 
For the thugs 
and my niggas out in Gouls

[verse 3] 
If it was a hundred dollar bill 
would ya, could ya ride for me 
start a fight, better yet, would you die for me 
under oath baby girl would you lie for me

well certified for me

or do it all for me 
Huh? 

[chorus] 
I'm doin' this one for the thugs

and the niggas on the corner sellin' drugs
