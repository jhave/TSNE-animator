Nasty
Nasty nasty
C'mon, uh huh
You know I like em when they're *nasty*
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

All I ever wanted was a nasty girl
to make a nigga hot and scream "Don't stop!" when you hit the spot
Ain't a treat wit me, cos you see me with the Lock
Ain't gon' leave with me cos you see me in the drop
Ooh I like that when it takes some game
justa, get your name, don't you see my chain?
Got a lotta ice and she like "Yeah that's nice
You Kasino right?", and I say "Yeah that's right"
"That was you that I seen on TV last night"
I say "Yeah", she said "I'm sorry, you ain't my type"
I want a chick I could holla at, throw a dollar at
If she wanna come chilly, tell her holla back
Got the Ac fo' in the lot, tell her follow that
back to the room, checkout time ain't til noon
"But I just met you" but it ain't too soon
Let's play house, you be the wife, I could be the ???

Chorus: Nite &amp; Day

All I ever wanted was a nasty girl
Someone who can go with the flow with the lights down low, oh
But she can't be easy, sleasy
Got to be based with freaky freaky
*repeat*

Excuse me Miss, you never heard me say I was rich
I just talk like this and walk like this
All I ever wanted was a nasty chick
who gonna strip when I say so, skip when I say go
Creep when I say no, uhh uhh I ain't think so
Party just beginnin, I'm thinkin bout it in us
As I don't drink or smoke, I'm thinkin bout women
in back of the truck, wit her legs up (That's right)
Sittin on 20's and she don't want money
She knows I'm a freak so she brung a friend for me
&gt;From around-the-way girls to a Playboy bunny
Use to be too thin to win but now I'm chubby
Just like a teddy bear, all the girls love me
Wanna play wit me, hopin, can't hit me
If I got enough money maybe she could stay wit me

Chorus

Tell me the truth, are you waitin after the show?
Cos you after my doe and an asskissin no
Let me know, do you want cash from the doe?
Is it sex or pay cheque you askin me fo'?
Pretty chick, don't you think that I'm serious?
I heard a lot about you, ain't you curious?
How you, shake your hips and you, lick your lips
Would you, give me a kiss if I give you my chips?
Ain't that type of girl, let me save you a trip
What if I was broke, all that I could give you is dick
I need a girl that's gon' still be, bout it bout it
No doubt about it, can't live without it
Sex me in the SC, so well
she need to ask me how she played, no replay
Playmate of the month, all she need is a pimp
I'm like the nastiest nigga since Larry Flynt

Chorus (x2)
