[Redman]
Whooooo! Yo yo yo, yo yo
Huh.. {*inhales*}..
Yo VANGLORIOUS
This is protected, by the Red

[Meth]	and TICAL
[Red]	Slap it down
[Meth]	Way out of bounds
[Red]	Throw in the towels
[Meth]	'fore we gun down

[Redman]
Yo, flipmodes, toilet bowls explode
When Doc, come drop a shitload
Grip fo's, mushrooms, did those
Dee pistolwhip hoes, a bitch owes..
.. money, bro I stick a zip code
Tiptoed, before Doc hit skid row
Thirsty?  Sniffin out a pig nose
My Benz built with wings and 6-0's
My flows is, North Pole cold
My hands got areas to fit snow
Doc, mixin hoes and disco's
My dogs, let em walk with ripped clothes
Shows, niggaz pack six rows
We're losin him!  His heart won't get pulse
Crack your backs off a ten percent dose
Lip closed?  I can hum and shit gold

Chorus: Redman

	[Meth] Tear the roof off the mother (repeat 8X)
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Back up, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't, want to fuck with us, you don't

[Method Man]
I gets down, rip sound, with this stick style
Pist-al, lick round, get off my dick now
Get crabbed, hostile, you kids is all sound timid
Scared to get in it, these dogs is Rockwild'
Unchained, untamed, you know my name
Act strange, pack flame, it's not a game
Just ill flows, that kills shows, you can feel yo
Kickin in you do', like a steel toe, for real doe
Y'all gon' learn, I spit germs
When you come short on Big Worm, you get burned
Punks don't get turned, they get done, and get sun
Come get some, the last vict-im, lie in a ditch
Now who wanna fuck with Hot Nikk'
Niggas chew gum with they ass and pop shit
Me and Funk Doc get, toxic
A bowl of rice and some chopsticks
Go make your Wu, just imposters

Chorus

[Redman]
Try to O.K. Corral with Doc and Meth Tical
Bar saloon fight, without weapons out (YEE-HAH!!)
Strech marks, like belly on Kevin ?Lous?
One yard to score, only second down
Hoes play wifey, wanna settle down
Tryin to lock cash?  Bitch better bounce
Boyfriend jump in, Meth shut him down
Pound to echo loud, bout seven miles
Doc, Dirty Jersey hunt em down
Uncut, rhymes won't even fit the file
Baddest man out the bunch, pick him out
Drunk with a gun, miss you hit the crowd
Snitches, someone kiss to stitch your mouth
Wilder then winos on liquor droughts
Mrs. Howell, Mary-Ann, dig em out
Ginger watch, with the gun in Skipper mouth
Love Da Ruckus, and love to dish it out
Pre-washed MC's, start rinsin out 
Get your whole camp put on the missin file
Pushin twelve out, bumpin digital

Chorus

[Method Man]
We Just-Ice, men or mice, ain't nuttin nice
(Fuck your life)  Your type just too light to fight
We move right, on Fright Night, when niggaz bite
We bust pipe, 'pon does that suck tight
We alright, you all hype and all tripe
In the Source with half mic, you half liked
and half dead, blasted on flatbed
I'm past dead, eyes red, the hash head
Burn somethin, earn somethin and learn somethin
Take my turn frontin, Def Jam ain't heard nuttin yet
Suspect, ruffnecks, book em Dano
You get bust-ed, never leave home without my mustard
Trust this, out for justice, clown
And caught on Judgement Day, call Joe Brown
Take MC's to town if they starbound
Ashes to ashes, they all fall down
Master you bastards with hazardous tactics
Semi-automatic full rap metal jacket
Blasted in plastic your brain on the mattrress
All you kids is ass-backwards and vice-a versa

Chorus

[Redman]
Come on, yo tear the roof off
Nigga, yo tear the roof off
Back up, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't, want to fuck with us, you don't
Huh..
Yo, you don't want to fuck with us, you don't
Yo, you don't want to fuck with us, you don't</pre>
