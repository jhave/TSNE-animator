[Chorus]
Time after time, find I question my life
How I went wrong, will it ever be right?
Will I rise?  Will I fall?  Stand tall
Continue asking, but I'm knowing only God know

Time after time, find I question my life
Where I went wrong, will it ever be right?
Will I rise?  Will I fall?  Stand tall
Continue asking, but I'm knowing only God know

[Verse One]
Growing up in the hood as a hard knock
I never knew nothing too much about young
My only concern was making my money and running these streets as a thug
Instead of the birds and bees, I always talk to murderers and the G's
That coldness inside me, but I ain't trying to hurt nobody
Temptation is keeping me steadily going under
And I wonder, if I could make it through the thunder
Cause I done caused so much hurt and pain to some that ain't deserve a thang
If I could change that, it would all be rearranged
But what's done is done and I paid the price
and now I'm like, Help me Lord, to better my life, my life
Just give me the chance to prove the world that I can be the man that I am
And I plan, on keeping it realer, really slow and steady

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
So now I'm headed to the chapel and I'm fin' to try marriage
It's goin' down yeah, yeah, yeah, but what do ya know?
Who woulda knew that would make situations worse
And my curse, nothing I've tried seems to work
And I drop to my knees and I pray, yes I pray
And I wonder if I'll ever see a better day  (I need a better day)
I've seen much in my time and I think it was too much for my eyes
The wickedness pulling me closer to failure everytime I think I'm rising, yeah
But you live and you learn and try to make better, gotta get control
Then follow the Lord and who knows where you'll go, for sho'
I can see how I've been sinnin
I'm asking the Lord for a little bit of forgiving, 'giving

[Chorus] - repeat 'til fade</pre>
