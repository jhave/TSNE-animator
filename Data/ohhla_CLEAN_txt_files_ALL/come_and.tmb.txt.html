[Timbaland]
Yeah!
Yeah!
It's Tim-Unit Nigga (HA HA HA)
Yeah!
You know I like how I sound on that nigga!
Huh!

[Timbaland]
Ugh, nigga, your time is up, I ain't come to kid you
I knew you niggas was dumb but how dumb is you?
Thinkin' you could see the king when you unofficial
You don't wanna go to war 'cause I launch these missiles
I'm a ride or die nigga, I be tearin' shit up
We ain't like them other fools, so don't compare 'em to us
All the hoes love a nigga they be backin' it up
But me, I love money, I be stackin' it up
When my band wagon pull up, they hop on board
They hop right on mine and hop right off yours
I get respect homie all across the board
I get a quarter mill a track without an award
Ever wanna test a nigga, then come see me
In the street, I hold my ground like I'm concrete
I know shit ain't sweet, so when shit get deep
I'm rich, I can pay to have you six feet deep, nigga

[Chorus: Timbaland] (2x)
I give it to whoever want it
If you want it come see me
You know where I'm at if you want it
If you want it come get me

[50 Cent]
Yeah!
Nigga, you violate, I regulate rata tat tat
Bigger shells they fit in that banana clip jack
Run and the bullseye form on your back
Hard to miss with a full clip in the mac
I got ammo, ammo, I load, reload
Cut a nigga quick, yeah my knife game lethal
That tough guy shit, nigga that's what I see through
You like a three course meal, motherfucker I eat you
You food, and I'm in the mood
So front I let the hammer fly
Nigga you could duck, run for cover or die
Your choice, you choose, I pop, you move
Like you ain't shot, you been shot
Nigga, your blood on the street
You up shit's creek, you can hardly speak
You startin' to get weak, your eyes close, your life flash
Your heart's slow, your heart stop, yo ass dead, you're fucked kid

[Chorus] (2x)

[Tony Yayo]
I'm like Nicolas Cage, Yay is the Ghost Rider
P89, yeah, I like my toast lighter
Costa Rica to Brazil I got my hoes in the Lear
While your bitch bald-headed like Britney Spears
I'm in the projects, gettin' dope and piff money
Two more flips that's Anna Nicole Smith money
Fuck a G4, I'm in a G500
G450, G550
That's airplane talk, I'm the aviator man
Baby AR shoot your baby out your hands
Spaghetti and corn bread mix got me blunted
This ho talkin' about she don't fuck on a empty stomach
Buy out the mall and hug the block
A hundered thou woodgrain in a Phantom drop
Then I cruise in the club, got my Rug' in the club
Pay the bouncer a buck, now my uz' in the club, yeah nigga!

[Chorus] (2x)</pre>
