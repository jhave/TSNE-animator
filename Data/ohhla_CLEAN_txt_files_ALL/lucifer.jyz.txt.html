{"Lucifer, don of de morning!  I'm gonna, chase you out of - earth"}
{"Lucifer Lucifer, don of de morning.."}

[Jigga] I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital

{"Lucifer Lucifer, don of de morning!  I'm gonna, chase you out of - earth"}

[Jigga] Kanyeeze you did it again, you a genius nigga!

{"Lucifer Lucifer, don of de morning.."}

[Jigga] So you need to change your attitude
[Jigga] 'fore they askin what happened to you

[Verse One]
Lord forgive him, he got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinnin
Them-a-murder me, so I gotta murder-dem
First emergency, doctors performin procedures
Jesus, I ain't tryin to be facetious, but
"Vengeance is mine" said the Lord
You said it better than all
Leave niggaz on death's door, breathin on
res-por-rators for killin my best, poor haters
On permanent, hi-atus as I skate
in the Maybach Benz, flyer than Sanaa Lathan
Pumpin "Brown Sugar" by D'Angelo
In Los Angeles, like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature
Ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been readin your Psalms and chapters
Payin your tithe, bein good Catholics, I'm comin

{"Lucifer, don of de morning!  I'm gonna, chase you out of - earth"}
{"Lucifer Lucifer, don of de morning.."}

[Jigga] I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital

{"Lucifer Lucifer, don of de morning!  I'm gonna, chase you out of - earth"}
{"Lucifer Lucifer, don of de morning.."}

[Jigga] So you niggaz change your attitude
[Jigga] 'fore they askin what happened to you

[Verse Two]
Yes, this is holy war
I wet y'all all with the holy water
Spray from Heckler-Koch auto-
matic all the static, shall cease to exist
like a sabbatical, I throw couple at you, take six!
Spread love, to all of my dead thugs
I pour out a little Louis, to a head above
Yessir, and when I perish, the meek shall inherit the earth
'Til that time, it's on and poppin, CHURCH
Like Don Bishop, the fifth or palm cock either
Lift up your soul or give you the holy ghost
Please I leave you in somebody's cathedral
for stuntin like Evel Knievel
I let you see where that bright light lead you
The more you talk, the more you irkin us
The more you gon' need memorial services
"The Black Album" second verse, is like
Devil's pie, save some dessert for us

[Interlude]
Man, I gotta get my soul right, uhh
I gotta get these devils out my life, uhh
These cowards gonna make a nigga right, uhh
They won't be happy 'til somebody die, uhh
Oh man, I gotta get my soul right, uhh
'Fore I'm locked up for my whole life, uhh
Every time it seems it's alright
Somebody want they soul to rise
I chase you off of this earth

[Verse Three]
Let me get serious for y'all, one second
I got dreams, of holdin a nine milla, to Bob's killer
Askin him why as my eyes fill up
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten, homes I still feel you
So, curse the day that birthed the bastard
who caused your church mass, reverts to crash
The first to blast then reverse the curse
The first to date and there you are, Bobalob
Lord forgive him, we all have sinned
But Bob's a good dude, please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the son of the mornin', thanks again</pre>
