[Verse 1-AZ]
Indecent thoughts, (???) niggas seeking support
Thief niggas never last, most sneak and get caught
Peep the cross, weak convos keeping it short
Shit shaky, shook niggas leak in they shorts
Who rule this, I run thru this unstrapped and foolish
Niggas is jeweless, feeble minded, young and foolish
New era, to me it's who whatever
Blunts, bottles, bitches, we could do whatever
I'm a made nigga BK, my trays is bigger
Niks is sick, dimes could eat away at yo liver
Live in the flesh
Two faced canvassers the best
Street repper, loved it (???) was the best
AZ and Ali, how we spit is how we sit and poly
It ain't shit, respect the game

[Verse 2-Ali Vegas]
Don't worry bout it A, I got it from here
Ain't shit gone change, I'm still the same nigga
Young face, old soul, powerful brian

Aiight
Back when Cat was running Queens, New York
I had a younger singer talk, gun slinger walk
Slanging chalk inside a Lincoln park, fiends and narks
Shine like a rainbow, A speak into the mic with a strange flow
Everyday that light in my brian glow, Brettas and white Drangos
Ever since Nikes and Kangos, rap was mine
I mastered lines to make old vets feel pass their prime
My staff'll shine off my shash of rhymes
Half the time you catch me cooking O's
Crooks and foe stand shook and frooze when Vegas open up his book of flows
I'm off the hook with thoose
Punching niggas, mushing hoes
Sosa copped a Velar jacket to match with the four-matic
Ali Vegas is a raw savage that'll squeeze off and let y'all all have it
Now here it goes</pre>
