[Master P]
Check this out Magic nigga 
A lot of niggaz be fakin like they have shit
like they doin this or that
but nigga you know here go the real

Chorus: Master P (repeat 2X)

The ice on my wrist shine like a light 
I can brighten up your day even at night

[Master P]
I'm just a young nigga hanging with the thug niggaz
Rollin with the drug dealers now they wanna mug niggaz
Ghettofabulous I mean we ballin
I represent the 3rd Ward, Calliope, New Orleans
If the price is on sale then I'ma buy it
Niggaz talkin bout they bigger than No Limit don't try it
No Limit don't stunt, or front, we got bank
I put that on the tank, and about 72 minks
in the closet, you want it we got it
Y'all leasin, we buyin, No Limit soldiers raise your Rolex high
My cousin Hot Boy just got out the pen
and check his wrist I mean he sitting on 1-10
Bling Bling with a 2000 big body
Hit the club and the girls get rowdy rowdy
Humvees on stretch, Ferrari's and 'Vette's
and a Rolls in the garage that I aint even drove yet

Chorus 2X

[Magic]
Shit I ain't got as much as P
but my Rolex cost me about 43 G's
Princess cut with a shine that will blind ya
You got platinum, but shit I'm right behind ya
I love diamonds, like I love rhymin
I need sun shades just to see the timin
Aww shit I done caused a fuckin accident
with a flick of my wrist man that wasn't meant
All this ice I got them hoes crazy
Keep the cat but I'll take some head baby
Last chance you better jump in this Mercedes
with me and P, smoking weed and drinking Hennessey
You know the real, who made the Forbes list?
I thought y'all was rich, man you niggaz ain't shit
You hate me cause I'm ballin
Everything that I drive is paid out (What)
A couple acres, man my shit is laid out (What)
I'm walkin around with a car on my arm
Shit they need to make a Roley alarm
Now I use my Roley for a mirror 
and what I see in the reflection is a rich nigga

Chorus 4X </pre>
