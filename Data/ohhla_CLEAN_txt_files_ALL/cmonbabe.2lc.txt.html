Intro:  (sound of woman being fucked)

Verse 1
[BM]  When the party's over, we can get together,
           Go to my house and fuck forever,
           And do whatever comes to mind
           Let me stick my dick in your behind
           You can pour me a glass of Dom Perignon
           Then suck my dick until I cum
           Soft is your body, tender is your kiss
           C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI]  No need to act stuck-up, pretty and seditty
           Got a funky disposition and you think you're witty
           You're not used to people saying things like this
           It's called criticism, and not a diss
           I only give compliments when they are due
           Now I'm gonna tell you all the truth
           You claim to be a virgin, I mean the purest
           I'll be gentle, baby, 'cause we can do this!

 Verse 2
[BM]   Love is the key to end all your woes
           You'll be my bitch, not a dirty hoe
           Together as one we will be
           I'll be fucking you and you'll be sucking me
           Then lick my ass up and down
           Lick it 'till your tongue turns doo-doo brown
           Don't try to be slick and give me a kiss
           C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI]  Bitch, it's time to spend the night
           Let's walk the beach in the moonlight
           Holding each other like lovers do
           When the pussy's wet, I'll know what to do
           Makin' love, holdin' you near
           Screams and moans is all I hear
           Quick is your tongue, soft is your lips
           Suck it, bitch, 'cause you can do this!

Verse 3
[BM]   Let's get it goin' on, let's act a fool
           Listen and learn while I take you to school
           You say you don't fuck on the first date?
           Then fuck you, bitch!  I ain't gonna wait
           'Cause my dick is hard and my back is strong
           I'll find another bitch to get it on
           'Cause now is the time so stop the bullshit
           C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI]  As you move your body, the shit you say
           Will make any man want to stay
           'Cause being with you is all I ask
           And fucking you will be my task
           My lonely nights will be filled with fun
           No more clubs and sex on the run
           Just suck this dick, while here I lay
           You can do this, so c'mon, babe!

(Mixx cuts "Fuck me, bitch!")

Verse 4
[BM]   Bitch, you say you's gonna give me some
           Now you wanna start acting dumb
           You wanna play cat and mouse
           When I catch you, I'ma stick my dick in your mouth
           Now stop the teasin' and start the pleasin'
           Just fuck me good until I skeet
           Bitch, stop fakin', you need to quit it
           C'mon, baby, 'cause we can do this!
[FKI]  Step to me and fall to your knees
           Suck this dick, put me at ease
           Do something special you know I like
           Smokin' head and please don't bite
           Slow and easy I pull the seat back
           Up and down, as I climax
           Steady in motion, I quietly say
           We can do this, so suck it, babe!

Woman's voice:
"I think that type of sexual activity is disgusting!"</pre>
