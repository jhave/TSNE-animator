[Erick Sermon, Verse 1]
Respect my views on this day and era
Keep your eyes upon me, and not the sparrow of berettas
I'm fly, than any bird on this earth
For what it be, my style is butter like Worth
I freak the beat like I'm lost in the twilight
a zone with no phone, looking over parasites
I pack the house like Woodstock when I rock
A three day event of me dropping the illest shit
From here to New Jerz, back to Brooklyn and Queens
To Uptown to Bronx River, I still deliver
The off the wall for y'all
Rearranged cameo-type strange pumping through your veins
What your mommy do, if you're not ready to die like Biggie
I'ma keep jamming like Ziggy
I got the arrows wiped down like Funkmaster Flex
Sway and Tech, and Premier, and we in here

[hook]
[Keith Murray] It's on like that! And everybody's welcome!
[Singer] You are welcome
[x4]

[Erick Sermon, Verse 2]
Now, it's on like that once again, it's getting hot
Now it's time to blow up the spot
For my niggaz out there on the block getting money
Playas whose hustling, doing their thing
But me, I've lounged without the stone
Do it for my peeps, take it to the streets
All day, everyday, I sets the mood
(?) Pile a bell of "Aye" (?), with new attitudes
I change not for the words, but for the better
And be a trend-setter, and bring the best ever
Yeah, teach me for the president
So I can bring the vibes through your residence (E Double!)
The ghetto blast, the green eyed rapper slash producer
And O.J. with the juice, uh!
Y'all know me, it's the E-R-I-C-K
So enjoy the day, and peace to Marvin Gaye

[hook]

[Verse 3]
Let's groove back and forth like Aaliyah
If you ain't got the vibe, then I wouldn't want to be ya
I threw it like a rap attack from New York to Hackensack
Kiss myself and jump back, surprise like a Crackerjack
The eye can bring the smiles without Shanice
And make enemies call truce, or even peace
Funk Lord fights back
again without the Force of Luke Sky, Chewbacca, R2D2 and the crew
The miracle worker (God praise him, praise him!)
All of them ready for the funk, you feel like you want like (blaaah!)
Whatever you requested, and you suggested
that I bring the pain like Method
It's nothing nice, cause I'm down for whatever
Me and my beretta, me and my beretta
Goddammit, don't leave your dog stranded
Who? Yeah, the Green Eyed Bandit
