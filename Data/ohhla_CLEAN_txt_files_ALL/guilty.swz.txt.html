[Verse 1: Swizz Beatz]
Now all my niggas stay dirty dirty, bust rounds by the thirty thirty

Y'all niggas know I ain't even got the leverage
Pullin out guns huh, never even usin 'em
Bounty we pull our guns and damn near abusin 'em
This goes out for my ghettoes in America
Real niggas stand if your fake I ain't hearin ya
And I don't need you on my album to sell
