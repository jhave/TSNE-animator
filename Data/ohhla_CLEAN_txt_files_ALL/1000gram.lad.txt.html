[Intro: La the Darkman]
Yeah...
This for all my niggas on the block...
Knawhatimean, word up... pushing that rock...
Knawhatimean, try'nna come up and get you a whole block
You know? Nahimsaying, yo

[La the Darkman]
I'mma state a couple facts, like to hear it, hear it go
Some people call it coke, some people call it blow
No matter the name, best believe it make dough
It's America's favorite rich drug, you know?
A sixteenth weight 1.5, probably pay
Fifty dollars for it, if you know some guys
An eightball, 3.5 grams, never pay more
Than a hundred fifty, for it, young soldier, if you can
Then you move to a quarter, 7.0
Two hundred to two fifty, you can get it, for sho
Now you on to a half 0, fourteen grams
You almost paid the rent, with this, my man
Cost you about 400, maybe 350
Might only get 12, if your peeps are shifty
I used to keep my scale with me, a small handheld
Nigga, tell me that it's weighed, I'mma weigh it myself
After that, come a whole onion, all 28
If you cop it for about 650, you straight
Make sure to scrape the plate, keep the razor straight
Do it right, bout 15 hundred, you can make
Then you copped one and a half, that's a little task
42 grams, cost eleven hundred cash
But if you flip it fast, you'll get four and a half
250 grams, now you ain't broke, fam
Pay 3,000 for that, you're slightly on the map
It depends on how much flip, you get back
But son, if your connect, is real like that
What ever you buy, he'll put on top, black
Now you got a half a brick, nigga, your hustle sick
But be careful homey, and don't buy shit
I know you thinking whip, cuz you seeing them stacks
But holmes, never show 'em what you got, relax
First cop a half and an ace, three quarters of a brick
You getting heavy, have somewhere to stash that shit
750 grams, boy, you're doing your thing
Watch them bitches, load them gats, serve the fiends
Feed your team, make sure, everybody eating
Once a week, you and your soldiers, have a meeting
Making sure nobody cheating, or stealing from the fam
You can build an empire, off a 1000 grams, my man...

[Outro: La the Darkman]
You knowhatimean, that's how it's done, youknowhatimean?
A ki, you know, that's how you get that
Once you get there, it can cost you anything or anywhere
From 16 to 24... depending on where you at and who you know
Take it from me, L.A.D., come up, nigga</pre>
