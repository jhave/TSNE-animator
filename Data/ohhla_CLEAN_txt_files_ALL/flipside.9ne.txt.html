[Girl] Only if you promise to smack me goddamnit
[Tech N9ne] I think I'm gonna do the uhh.. hook on this one. Yea

*Tech and girl moaning*

[Tech N9ne] Ok, turn around so I can hit it from the back
[Girl] No
[Tech N9ne] Come on!
[Girl] I don't want to..
[Tech N9ne] You don't want me to hit it from the back? Come on! BIANC!

[Tech N9ne]
I like to hit it on flip
Don't trip
I make it worth it
If you nervous I got the service
That'll make you work it
You deserve it
A sex spot
To flex wet spots
With grip
Stressin' now cause ain't nobody throwin tips
Ya hips
So amazin' I'm gazin'
You blazin'
Praisin'
That I'm no longer shriveled like a raisin
I'm stone - hopin that ya homegirl I entered is
I'm down, even if the ??'s degenerous
I'ma clown the punana
Pound the pupan
Hate it like a croutan
Wise words from ?God Zoutan?
The flip baby
No gip baby
Nina like the way you strip baby
No way you dip ladies
See me in your city be ready
When I'm looking for some fun
I be coming at ya
Five hundred worth of 1's
Just the trick off
Gather ya oils to lick off
You and ya homegirl rollin' with me, jerkin' my dick off
Not a rip off
Just gettin' it tossed
The lip gloss
Ya lips lost
So deep in it they callin' me the pit boss
I'm lovin' it the way you got me shovin' it
? Slip-slide. Watch yo ?
I cried when I hit it on the flipside

(Chorus)

[Girl] Which side
[Tech N9ne] Flipside
[Girl] This side
[Tech N9ne] Ladies so I ? die
[Girl] That's right
[Tech N9ne] Ain't nothin' thick about the way I like it
The jiggle making me fizzle when you make it make it wiggle a little
Stay on the Flipside
[Girl] Which side
[Tech N9ne] Flipside
[Girl] This side
[Tech N9ne] Ladies so I ? die
[Girl] That's right
[Tech N9ne] This ain't no ballad talkin' about how I'm in love
This is strictly for the strippers in the club, on the flipside

[Tech N9ne]
Meet me in Las Vegas, I'm stayin' at the Grand
Keys under Nina when you be fightin' with yo man
Into it - no undees
Get ready to bungy
jump me
Knew you meant business when you ripped out my aubercumby
Hormones hungry
Like to get me down under like Crocodile Dundee
Keepin' yo sex weapons from me
I'm grungy
?? I'm freaky like zombie
??
Yellin Tech N9ne I love the way you done me
And then I'm Solomon Grundy
You's a flower when I killed it
You wilt it
Who got power
Call me (Deep Space N9ne)
???
Cuz I rocked 'em all
With socks and all
Y'all 'iancs, I hit the lots of y'all
Slots
Show em, show 'em what you got
Girl you makin' it hot
???
Non stop
This game is silky
I hope you milk
I'm fiendin'
Not killin' me cause you can't touch my vibe
If you jockin' Kenin
I fly in semen
Ya cryin' ?
It feels so well
Get chills in Hell
Screamin' demon
Before you nut up
I want you to shut up
And give it to me face down, butt up
I just die
When I hit it on the flipside

[Girl] Which side
[Tech N9ne] Flipside
[Girl] This side
[Tech N9ne] Ladies so I ? die
[Girl] That's right
[Tech N9ne] Ain't nothin' thick about the way I like it
The jiggle making me fizzle when you make it make it wiggle a little
Stay on the Flipside
[Girl] Which side
[Tech N9ne] Flipside
[Girl] This side
[Tech N9ne] Ladies so I ? die
[Girl] That's right
[Tech N9ne] This ain't no ballad talkin' about how I'm in love
This is strictly for the strippers in the club, on the flipside

[Tech N9ne]
Can you feel it baby
(Do you want me to touch my waistline)
I can heal it baby
(?? trust, press and grind)
Bout to kill it baby
(Doin' the fucks, a good time)
I wanna do it baby, stick it baby
(Sex on the mind)
Enough!
Girl you drivin' me nuts
You and ya homie's hype horny comin back from peenuts
With hokie-pokie
On the brain and we can keep it low-key
? hot is when they comin' back from sokey
?? without the oppostry
Listen closely
Lap dance in the corner
I'm all up on her
Two more coronas
You leaving with me
Cuz I'm increasing the fee
You leasin to pee
Hella fat like Jackie, pleasening me
I got mine, what you do
Call girls, the way you dance and strip
Deck down to ya tips
Beautiful lips
Ya say that ya
Like it way betta
From a wild style
Nigga comin' sex crazed at ya
On the flipside

[Outro]
Can you feel it baby
(Do you want me to touch my waistline)
I can heal it baby
(?? trust, press and grind)
Bout to kill it baby
(Doin' the fucks, a good time)
I wanna do it baby, stick it baby
(Sex on the mind)</pre>
