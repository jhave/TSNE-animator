Bay-bay! Baby; right where I wanna be
Bay-bay! Baby; don't let love make a fool of me
Yeah, I want it AND, I need it
Oh my body just won't lie
And oh yeah, I feel it when you try and kill it
My body just won't die
Who knew that one to the head and then one more to the heart
can make you feel, al-right
Oh won't you come set me free, take me out my misery
and make me feel, al-right

[Chorus: Lauren] + (Cee-Lo)
Love gun! (sexy, sexy, sexy)
