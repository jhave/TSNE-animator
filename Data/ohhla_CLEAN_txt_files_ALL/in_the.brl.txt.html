The Plague

In the beginning
There was darkness
And then came the light
And everybody was happy
Then came the plague
And the siccness and the doom followed
Then everybody died

[Verse 1]
Funny funny,
Mad Dog for the money money
Grab y'all to the tummy dummy
Some of you listen im stable
It's nothin
Like bein in a cell with Doom niggaz
See a spell
WWW make a motherfucka smell.Plague.net
Real niggaz we bout techs
Hit you in the neck
Real gettas we buy guns
When the shit get funkadelic
Bound to hit you wit the ?? gun
Shots to the abdomen
Death becomes ???

[Verse 2]
We tore this Northtown savage
And I'm all about my cabbage
I pierce my dick 
And I'm quick to tell some shit about hoes and automatics
I'm equipped with a clique of rhymes
I'm equipped with a clique of bitches
I'm equipped with a clique of slugs 
Fo sho' to sink you with the quickness

[Verse 3]
Snake
Through the streets of south Nevada
Find me a simple minded bitch
And I lick my lips and then I'm out 
Playboy 7, Northtown Doomsday
Las Vegas homes
Soon as I go 
I'm bout to say get 'em

[Verse 4]
The shit that got me hot
Now I got my glock
And I got it cocked
So I'm a let it pop
Like pop goes the weasel
Motherfuck your Volvo horsepower
Nigga you fuckin with a diesel
That'll destroy your head up
In your darkest hour
Cuz nigga I'm a killa
Better known to your baby mama as the rapist
When I raise the people's hand and eyebrow
Watch real life embraces
So I put the smackdown
On your candy ass
And if you scared to get 'em up motherfucker
We still gone blast

[Verse 5]
Here's a lesson in demonology
I'm darin my enemies to size out chronologically
Make no apology
Trust no other motherfuckers
Except my doom niggaz I crush
Any punk bitch niggaz 
That wanna fuck with us
Known for croppin motherfuckers down to the bone
With a semi-automatic
Double-edged axe blade chrome
With an army like Anubis
We keep comin no matter what
So fuck a punk bitch that try to do to us</pre>
