Something had woke me, a thump on my roof
It was followed by crashing, more thumping ensued
I jumped out of my bed thinking I'd been invaded
Heard smashing, more pounding, the sound escalated
Looked out of my window, blood dripped down the glass
I see bodies lay twisted and mangled on grass
I ran into the main room and Shaggy was dead
So was Nate The Mac, Jumpsteady and ABK
Bolted out of the house to see if it's a joke
I heard hundreds of car alarms, saw flames and smoke
And the sky above red, I see dead bodies fallin'
It's raining with corpses, the blood is appalling

Mama told me when it rains, it pours
But never mentioned dead bodies, dead bodies
Mama told me when it rains, it pours
La dee da, da da dee, la da dee, dead bodies

I never seen so many horrified looks on people's faces
The blood is appalling
I hope I never see what all them people saw, and put them in their places
The blood is appalling
The sun was so hot, so hot
I was burning, yeah

Dead bodies lay randomly, some stack in piles
On all of their faces, pure horror, no smiles
I see children and elders and ninjas my age
All lay naked and mangled, most withered for days
I found safety, a shelter, I'm under a tree
Only fingers and organs come falling on me
I lay sleepless for days as the raining continued
The heat of the sun baking corpses like food
Then it finally stopped, I walk knee deep in blood
Over piles of bodies, through what was my hood
It was right at that moment the wraith had appeared
And the message it left me might sound kind of weird
But take all that I'm seeing and opposite that
Truth is I'm the one dead and this is my Hell's Pit</pre>
