Do they know? {*15X*}
They don't know shawty!

Sheeit
Give me a pen.. and some paper
Write a rhyme.. no flavor
You minor.. I'm major
Slingblade, I like fried taters!
I like pork and beans, I like pork chops
I like spamburgers, I like my ham YEAHHHHH
... fuck you say yeah for?
I don't know - fuck y'all niggaz care for?
You see my dirty shoes, and my dirty house
And my dirty spouse, I'm from the Dirty South
Peep the country grammar, I'm a country 'Bama
Funny pants, big shoes, I'm a country hammer
YEAHHHH, and that ain't cool (cool)
And cool ain't that (that) and bitch I'm whack
YEAHHHH {*laughing*}</pre>
