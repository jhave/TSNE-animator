INTRO [Saukrates]
Yes sir
When the man wanted to ride, what did he do?
Swing down sweet chariot
He told that sweet chariot to swing on down
And stop, you know what I'm sayin'
So he could get on
Now this is what we do
We playin' we playin' the role of that sweet chariot
And we swingin' down to pick you up
Know what Iim sayin'?
Ride, for real
Now, it's like, you wanna ride with me
You don't even know what ride is, look
You wanna get clean, you wanna get dirty
You wanna go left, right
This what we do

[Choclair]
Well it's the Nocka, The Chiz Rocker
Party while I'm wine drinkin'
My rhymes'll bust a hole right through your thinker
Re-think your stratagies when you battle
Interntational record sales
People try, but they fail
It's the Chizzo, or the Choco
Ran the street like a blocko
Before the shots ring out
People never seen or even heard
But we ran through your HQs
Like a pack of germs, people swerve from the gamer
Suave player, I'm all black like the Raiders
You wonder how I did it, album anticipated
Well it's the ninth inning
With two outs I hit a home run to left field like Carter did to Philly
Do you understand me?  Ha, really?
No MacGyver tactics can stop my theatrics
I'm making ladies back flip
Understand it's all about the Sexual eating up your set like a tropical
Stop it, my UVs will burn your skin, singe your optics
Twenty One years was ground work
People hear me coming, so hit up for mad work
But understand it's all about the suave, diggy-dog
Just ride

[Choclair] {Saukrates}
If you feelin' my vibe then we can all just
{Ride}
If you wanna get down then we can all just
{Ride}
All my people throw your hands up high and just
{Ride}
Where you from? Eastside to Westside just
{Ride}
All my people from uptown to downtown just
{Ride}
From Cali to NY, you know we gon' just
{Ride}
From the Florida Keys to Fiji just
{Ride}
All my people worldwide, how you feel, just
{Ride}

[Choclair] {Saukrates}
You see, I flow like an 850, the turbo
Down the lakeshore with po-po chasing
Then you be wastin' your time
  {Swing down sweet chariot, stop} X2 in background
If you try to check for flaws
If you bet against Chizz-nocks
Count your loss
See I don't care what you people think or say
What you do, I got a crew that run up in your HQ
Dissed by who, six foot one, sleppy eyed
Dark skinned glasses reflecting from the sun, nigga
Check that poster, I lay your girl down like a coaster
Drop my glass, slap that ass
Don't care about a thing
See it's all about the way Chocs makes the bells ring
People talkin' shit but can't do a damn thing
So understand this, it's all about the lyricist
No one can rock a beat just like I
Borough Side representer, C-H the I-Z
Knows how to ride, understand?
Just ride

[Choclair] {Saukrates]
All my peoples on Lockdown, you know we can
{Ride}
All my peoples on the corner hustlin just
{Ride}
All my girls in tight skirts, you know we gon' just
{Ride}
All my people pushin fat rides with illy rims just
{Ride}
If you can feel the vibe, then we can all just
{Ride}
All my dames in sexy belly chains just
{Ride}
All my people from the T-dot O, just
{Ride}
All my peoples worldwide, how you feel? just
{Ride}

[Choclair]
See I like the Chiquitas light and dark skinned
Me, I love Senoritas, that's where my hearts been
Now I be chillin' with my boys Paranorm'
Having freaks in the living room suckin' it hard
See I don't care what you think, nigga
Yo, I'm laughing at your bitch-ass
So niggas mind you speach when you talk
All these people gettin' mad and vexed
Sayin' all I talk 'bout sex
Make a fuss 'cause they nuts don't bust
So understand who I is {who you is}
I got an SDS smile, while your girl's got an ass like an E-class
I can drive it like a five-speed, stick shift
Understand the ill shit that I possess, nothin' less
If you stress, you be left blind, so read it up in brail
Hard rock's coming but they always come frail
Collobaration produced by Kardinal
Now if you wanna ride, everybody needs to understand
Just ride

[Choclair] {Saukrates}
All my Paranormal people, how you feel, just
{Ride}
All my FOS people how you feel, just
{Ride}
All my Cirlce mother fuckers, are you gonna just
{Ride}
All my peoples on Kneedeep, you know we just
{Ride}
All my peoples on the hill, how you feel, just
{Ride}
All my peoples in Hilltop, you know we gon' just

All my peoples from Rexdale, you know we gon' just
{Ride}
All my people from the T-dot O just

[Choclair &amp; Saukrates]
Swing down sweet chariot, stop
Swing down sweet chariot, stop
Swing down sweet chariot, stop

[Saukrates]
