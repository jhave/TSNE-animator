Words like boy what is you doin' you created that shit

Chorus:

Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy
You crazy because my baby ain't
Just a Lil' bad Ass yellow boy
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy
You crazy because my baby ain't
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble

First Verse
{Yella Boy}

Causin' my trouble seven days a week 
Mami couldn't find a nice neighbor just to watch me
Them people round the corner talkin' bout I'm just to wild
Grownups on my back bout they can never change my style
Ya said at a young age a nigga couldn't fuck
I'm peepin' out the girlie's up the block to get my dick sucked
Now I'm a hit the rope for three days that's the word
Call my aunti will you watch him he ain't workin' on my nerves
So I'm stuck with my mama bout to jet straight out of town
I was waitin' on a greyhound so you know I had to clown
Yes I'm array array oh it's late time to catch some Z's
Greyhound number seven all you heard was quiet please
Just diggin' around the luggage hopin' I can find a gangster gun
(Boy get out of shit) Suck my dick I'm havin' fun
But all my life I wonder if a nigga just behave they said

Chorus:

Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy
You crazy because my baby ain't
Just a Lil' bad Ass yellow boy
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy
You crazy because my baby ain't
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble

Second Verse:
{Yella Boy}

Now I reached double figures and I'm at the age of twelve
You can never beat my talent so bitch don't tell me to go to hell
I'm just a young and hard menace drivin' everything in site
If you got a lil' bet tell that sucker I want a bite
I went to Cargo Loofa with the polo and the jeans
Couldn't be no fuckin' hoe you had to strap to see this dick
Much trouble mo trouble that's all a lil' one know
It will never ever stop me and that's another thing I know
For all my life I always wonder what it meant to behave they said

Chorus:

Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy
You crazy because my baby ain't
Just a Lil' bad Ass yellow boy
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy
You crazy because my baby ain't
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble

Third Verse:
{Yella Boy}

A nigga is much older they got someone to content me
But I like just like that while respect you know I'm kickin' it
It was ruff back in the days I learned my fuckin' lesson
I went to jail as a juvie I caught with Smith and Wesson
Now have you heard that sayin' it'll be greater later
I know that sayin' true because I got Mannie on the turn table
I had to stop bein' a clown had to turn my life around
Signed with cash money you know the "U" is never goin' down
Still causin' trouble but this time it's done the right way
Rippin' the fuckin' mic up all you suckers better make way
I'm mad as a muthafucker in this bitch to win it
My pockets is gettin' bigger and this only the begin'
All my life I wonder what it was to behave they said

Chorus:

Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy
You crazy because my baby ain't
Just a Lil' bad Ass yellow boy
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy
You crazy because my baby ain't
Just a Lil' bad ass yellow boy
When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble


When I was young I wasn't nothin' bout trouble
