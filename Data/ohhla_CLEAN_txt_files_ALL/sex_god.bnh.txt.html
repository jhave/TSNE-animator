[Verse One] [Phonte]
Yo, yo yo yo yo
Call me a sex god cause I'm willin' to do what you only imagine in dreams
That triple lick, that you only see in scenes
That don't need little blue pills of ginseng
Just wanna see your booty pop out the inseams
Then we can do what we do
It's kinda strange isn't it
Cause on the streets we like Bill and Camille
But in the sheets we go to war like Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith
Phontigga got your love on lock
And everybody wanna ask me how
(Say what?!)
Cause I'm the only dog that tames your sex kitten
You pussy's the cats meow, rrrraaarrr
C'mon

[Brand New Heavies]
Baby don't take too long
Move too slow and I'll be gone
Make a move right now so I can feel you close don't hesitate now
Baby you're off the chain
Wanna hear you call my name
But I can't be a victim
Hurry up and make a play for me

[Chorus] [Brand New Heavies]
All I want to do is love
I want to know
Baby boy can get it low?
I want you now
Will you give me hello?
How bad do you want more?
Baby boy I could just eat you up
How bad do you want more?

Baby boy I could just eat you up
Knock on my door tonight
I can't wait for you to come inside
Knock on my door tonight

I can't wait for you to come inside

[Verse Two] [Brand New Heavies]
Hey there big and strong
I wanna be your baby doll
So walk across the floor and come and get me 
Come on now
You know that I like to play
It doesn't matter what time of day
So drop that shy emotion
Get a grip let's get it on
Let's get it on

[Chorus] [Brand New Heavies]
All I want to do is love
I want to know
Baby boy can get it low?
I want you now
Will you give me hello?
How bad do you want more?
Baby boy I could just eat you up
How bad do you want more?
Baby boy I could just eat you up
Knock on my door tonight
I can't wait for you to come inside
Knock on my door tonight
I can't wait for you to come inside

All I want to do is love
I want to know
I want you now
