Peace.. peace.. peace y'all!

Now move on.. move on.. yeah..
("Hey man are you ready to go?")  Yeah..

[Butterfly]
Boogie jive and rap is life where I'm from
Where I'm from, I might play with Izzy where I'm from
Where I'm from, it be like, "run your coat black"
Jupiter, keeps her fat beats by the pack
Where I'm from, nappy hair is life
We be reading Marx where I'm from
The kids be rockin Clarks where I'm from
You turn around your cap, you talk over a beat
and dig some sounds boomin out a jeep 
Where I'm from, cocoons hide the youth, swoon units 100 proof
You want some beef, they will cut you some
Where I'm form, the beats is infinite where I'm from
Voodoo, ashubani, gangsta lean where I'm from
I'm interplanetary, my insect movements vary
It's kinky if it's hair, G, where I'm from
The firehoses blow, it's purple wind and snow
I do a hit and go, SPLIT
It's hip, what's hip?  When hip is just the norm
Cause Planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all it's forms 
The kinks, the dance, the prints in all the shirts
My grandmother told my mother it's Africa at work
On vibes, we freak, them universal beats 
You find it at the spot you hit at ends of every week
We twist, exist, to spin the maddest hits
Up here funk is our neighbor so we paid her a visit
The lip we sip can't house the nine zips
For rock we can't do nothin, for this we come equipped
Off disc, off tape, rap blastin til from 8
The really truly fat the fly on the flip
Cocoa gotta know, how Planets, gotta roll
Speak the mega cool, get funky as a goal
It's calm, relax, we're only some new jacks
that acts from the funk but don't play the role
Where you from?
....

[Doodlebug]
Weekend "Dig Plans" got T's where I'm from
Where I'm from, it's Clarence 13 where I'm from
Where I'm from, brothers took the beat and got fly
(Why?) That's most asked by 85, where I'm from
Fakin the funk you get did
Projects, tenements, pyramids
Where I'm from, we're livin off the boom boom crack 
It's that hip hop rockers jazz when I max
Peace be the greeting of the insect tribe
Pestilent forces can't catch the vibe
We live to love and we love to rock mics
We speak in ghetto tongue cause ghetto's the life
Food for thought so get a buffet plate
The lyrics are so fat you might gain weight
So just watch me step alone, into the sunset
Left foot right foot 1-2 mic check
Brewin funk inside my soul kitchen 
So pull up a chair here's a bit have a listen
of hardhead intervene, damn I know you're fluent
Yeah, cause Doodle ain't havin it and Butterfly knew it
Where you from?
....

[Ladybug]
Venus acts a fool at the square right?  (Yeah)
Doctors engineer in apparel right?  (Yeah)
Hip-Hop made a point last year right?  (Yeah)
But Planets is the joint this year right?  (Yeah)
Planets got the dubs and live to grass-hop
Duck out from the fuzz, that sweat the hip-hop
Risin like we foam, get it from the dome
I'm from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
We can get a kit, without, no thread
Feelin funky beats go straight, to the head
Fall into a club, dig on what we love
It be past six, before we reach bed
Butter freaks on relics we say, those are fat
Doodle makin silk, LaQuan, where it's at?
We need to stack a sack, for rap to take us dap
So we treat our clips, just like, bustin caps
Rip it til dawn, kick it til dawn
Hip-Hop is the fix, or else, we be gone
People thought they canned it, rap is not by bandits
Digable Planets got it, goin on

{all together}
Everywhere, every every where (yeah) *8X*</pre>
