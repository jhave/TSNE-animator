Song:   Moment of Clarity
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Woo!  Geah, geah (Young), geah
Uhh, turn the music up, turn the lights down
I'm in my zone

[Chorus]
Thank God for grantin me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty - the world'll feel my truths
All through my +Hard Knock Lifetime+, +A Gift and a Curse+
I gave you +Volume+ after +Volume+ of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the +Dynasty+ by bein one of the realist niggaz out
Way beyond the +Reasonable Doubt+ - y'all can't fill my shoes
From my +Blueprint+ beginnin to that +Black Album+ endin
Listen close you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse One]
Pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well
Between him doin heroin and me doin crack sales
With that in the eggshell, standin at the tabernacle
Rather the church, pretendin to be hurt, wouldn't work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like damn, that man's face is just like my face
So pop, I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
It wasn't all your fault, homey you got caught
Into the same game I fought, that Uncle Ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re-meet each other
Save a place in heaven 'til the next time we meet forever!

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Music business hate me cause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be makin
I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars
They criticized me for it yet they all yell "HOLLA!"
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be
lyrically, Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
But I did five mill' - I ain't been rhymin like Common since
When your cents got that much in common
And you been hustlin since, your inception
Fuck perception go with what makes sense
Since I know what I'm up against
We as rappers must decide what's most impor-tant
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win/win
So next time you see the homey and his rims spin
Just know my mind is workin just like them...
... rims, that is

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
My homey Sig' was on a tear where no tears should fall
Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See in my inner circle all we do is ball
'Til we all got triangles on our wall
Ain't just rappin for the plat-i-num, y'all record
I recall, cause I really been there before
Four scores and seven years ago prepared the flow
Prepared for war, I should fear no man
You don't hear me though
These words ain't just 'pared to go
In one ear, out the other ear, no!  Yo
My balls and my word is alls I have
Whatchu gon' do to me nigga, scars or scab?
Whatchu gon' box me homey?  I can dodge a jab
Three shots couldn't touch me, thank God for dat
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back
And the whole BK, nigga holla back

[Chorus]</pre>
