Nicoderm patch and a Marlboro red
Wild turkey out the bottle, gauz covers where the wrists bled
I begged and pled and fled rocking a hospital gown brain dead
Hitched a ride with a guy named Fred

Hey Fred, fuck that, Rehab, shit
I don't know if I want peace that bad
It's that I'm so comfortable, uncomfortable and sad
Everybody else seems to get mad, yeah, yeah

Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear
I look half dead from here and I need bread for beer
They're probably discovering my empty bed about now
No turning back, oh my God
I turn up the radio, rain smacking the window
I'm the Mario inside the Super Nintendo
Can't hide when you're sick
And the chemicals are holding the joystick

Hey Fred, fuck that, Rehab, shit
Cause I don't know if I want peace that bad, yeah, yeah
It seems that I'm so comfortable, uncomfortable and sad
But everybody else gets so damn mad, yeah, yeah

Vegitation, euphoric hope, I'm graspin'
Walkin' out the methadone clinic, fuck it, I'm relapsin'
Heaped up on more snow than Asperin
Looking for fudge ripple, I got my rig
Life is good, oh how you fig
Pump up my dose to triple, yo, main line
Noddin' out, fallin' on my spine
CC's and cheap wine, back to the land of the blind
Rewind, opium dens knockin' out brain cells in the tens of thousands
Hookers and junkie hens and shitty housin'
How arousing, day six in the desert, on a horse with no name
Gradual suicide, but whose to blame
I guess it's nobody's fault, I'm just lame
Nothin' stops cause if I'm headed back to Detox
I'm drinkin' Clorox

Hey Fred, fuck that, Rehab, shit
Cause I don't know if I want peace that bad, yeah, yeah
It seems that I'm so comfortable, uncomfortable and sad
But everybody else gets so damn mad, yeah, yeah

Quick Fred, floor it, I gotta get away
Hands me a J, says it will be okay
Like an old friend is the smell and the taste
You know, Fred, I just couldn't take that place

Hey Fred, fuck that, Rehab, shit
Cause I don't know if I want peace that bad, yeah, yeah
It seems that I'm so comfortable, uncomfortable and sad
But everybody else gets so damn mad, yeah, yeah
Hey Fred, hey Fred</pre>
