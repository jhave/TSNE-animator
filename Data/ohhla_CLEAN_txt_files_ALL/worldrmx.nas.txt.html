"Who's world is this?" 2x

[Verse 1].....la la la, la la la
I sip the Dom P, watchin Gandhi til I'm charged
Writin in my book of rhymes, all the words pass the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin, mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin time like
'Pappy' Mason with pens I'm embracin
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Air the Nikes on my feet, keep my cypher, complete
Whether crusin in a Sikh's cab, or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, beats make me fallin asleep
I keep fallin, but never fallin six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Take money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Chorus]
"Whose world is this?"
The world is yours
Disciple of the projects slash verbal murderer
"Whose world is this?"
Yeah the world is yours
To the philly bluntheads, crackpumping drug murderers
"Whose world is this?"
The world is yours
To my niggaz coming home from lockdown with new plans
"Whose world is this?"
@%*#, the world is mine
Holdin' a stolen cop's glock with G-notes in my hand
"Whose world is this?"

[Verse 2]
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
My insight enlights vision
Words of wisdom, niggaz pay me intuition
To listen, to murder paragraphs of mysticism
Man plant seeds that brings forth multiple breeds
So many cultures in one planet but one culture's free
Son, I need weed to proceed
Change the flow speed and I'm getting vexed Guiliani and six six six
There's no days for broke days selling smoke pays
I toke the chocolate, potent phillies never roach spray
Shit is a hassel, the bridge is like a haunted castle
The mic's my religion, the system is the Devil's lassle
Hey yo, the trife life is the most influential
The colors on mens skins and pens is coincidental
How ya livin'? Large or broke uh
You're wasting time extortin papers from smokers
Cacthing court papers getting broker

[Chorus]
The world is mine
Persona of late Tony Montana yet gettin' mine
"Whose world is this?"
The whole world is mine
Who want it, I never front it, I'm forever blunted, gettin' lye
"Whose world is this?"

Ante up with the lye (La la la)
Never stop, we don't stop (La la la)
The hennylo, puff a lye y'all (La la la)
Don't stop the hennylo (La la la)
Who puff the lye? (La la la)
Everyday, puff the lye plus the hennylo (La la la)

[Verse 3]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down singlehanded
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside in a thousand miles from home
I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana stabbin bitches like the Phantom
The crew is lampin Ill Will style
Check the gold toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the fly clothes, burnin dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks wit a bop, checkin dames plus the games
people play, I check the dames plus the games people play
bust the problems of the world today

"Who's world is this?" 5x
(until end)
"La la la, la la la, la la la la la"

(Outro)
Yeah yeah, yeah Wizard, keep that lye in the air
Yo, I wanna give a shout out to the whole fuckin' Queens
My man Tipster on the boards, keepin' it real Lord
The Queensbridge nation, get it on
Fakin' no fuckin' jacks, fuck around and get your wig pushed back
And big shout out to my man Killa, ???? is on you
L.E.S. on another murder quest, '94 and we out
Keep the lye in the air, Hennessy everywhere
Keep the la la goin'...</pre>
