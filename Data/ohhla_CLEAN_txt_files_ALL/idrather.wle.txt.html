I'd rather beeeeee with youuuuuuuuuuuu

Rather be, rather
Rather beee with youuuuuu
 
[J.Cole]
Yeah
Hey
Ay though I love you hate that bitch that's always with you
aShame I gotta put up with her shit just to get you
She thru another fit you had to split because she was wit you
And now I'm at the crib all alone damn I miss you
Ay when we first met you was too tense for me to get through
And then I got you loose it's like a glove how I fit you
Your two lips they smell like tulips so official
My niggas'll probably clown me if I told 'em that I kissed you
But you clean as a whistle Wet as a tissue in the toilet
Love to hit that spot get you hot like I boil it
Even let ol' girl watch she enjoy it 
Even though she make it hard for me to see you
Knowing that I need you
Now look, don't make a grown nigga beg that ain't fair bitch
Just take them clothes off oh look you got your hair did
For me looks good She said oh you so sweet
Now get me while you can you bout to have to wait a whole week
Ah hell not the beast really I don't give a fuck
Well since you already bleedin' that mean I don't get to cut
Ay Look I'm already fienin' so just let me slide thru
Tell your homegirl relax and let me get inside you
Because that booty mad thick behind your juicy ass lips
I'm trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi in this bougie ass chick
The only reason that I put up with this moody ass bitch
Is... you.
 
Rather be, (Hey baby its... you) rather 
Rather be, (Now baby its... you) rather
Rather be, (Hey baby its... you) rather
(And I... ) rather beee with youuuuuu 
 
 
 
 
[Wale]
Yeah
She said I love you she talks tellin' me to kiss her up
But when her friend visits I doesn't get it much
Its soo-woo season and shawty dick teasin' now for that reason 
Now my shit is like a crip sneaker
Listen love of my life I'm tryin' to get some, uh-tention
You don't gotta listen just give a fuck
Your mouth I don't need your legs you can keep
Just tryin' to get up in your jeans re-sew your seams
And your pussy was the cameo but stole the scene
So I got my camera on your cameltoe say cheese
Two lips blowin' kisses, muah to my mistress
Goodbye to my girl when I'm in it
I'll take you out shorty but let me know its mine
I'll paint you with my tongue and stay in those bikini lines
See it's a part of you I gotta be a part of 
But every other part of you make me wanna depart and
Baby look at what you started, why am I working for it
Why are we still conversing when I'm sure you've heard the chorus
I'm sure you get the point and I prefer you throw it urgent
Your mind can say no but she can't control the urges
Because your booty mad thick behind them juicy ass lips
Trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi when I'm thru with that shit
The only reason why I put up with this stupid ass bitch
Is because of you.
 
[Chorus]
Rather be, rather
Rather be, rather
Rather be, rather
(And I... ) rather beee with youuuuuu
 
[Curren$y]
Uh, and how I wish I would've met you first
Never had a chance to try 
Cause your overprotected friend saw the lust in my eyes
So you she would hide
Because she thought of me as a typical guy
Which you know I'm differ-right
You listenin' to her
Leaving you with empty nights
Recognize shawty, be real with ya'self
Mama feelin' herself literally
And I wondering if I mention this to get rid of me
Cause every time you come by to kick it
And I open up the door you bring her cranky ass with you
Influencing your decisions I can't even get a minute
Without her making attempts to go and hog up all of my attention
She talk and I don't listen
I'm just picturin' me stickin' and movin' you moanin' 
Music on the counter in the kitchen
This better be that niggas bitch reachin' for my zipper
Cause they figure there is no way that my dick is big I beg to differ
If they let the research droop I so get it 
She know you'll never be the same if I hit it
You know you longing for the stroke so you drippin'
She smoking and that will be the scapegoat for sippin'
Oooo your booty so thick behind them juicy ass lips
Trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi when I'm thru with that shit
The only reason that I put up with this bougie ass bitch
Is... you
 
[Chorus]
Rather be, rather
Rather be, rather
Rather be, rather
(And I... ) rather beee with youuuuuu</pre>
