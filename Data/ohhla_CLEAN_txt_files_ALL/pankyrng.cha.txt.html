[Big Diamond Rangs 3x] Yeah, Rasaq boy

[Big Diamond Rang] Ay

(Hook - Rasaq)
Ay you could tell by my [pinky rang that I'm so throwed]
Ay, Uh-Ey - Ay you could tell by my [pinky rang that I pull hoes]
Ay, Uh-Ey - Ay you could tell by my [pinky rang that I'm so cold]
Ay, Uh-Ey - Ay [Chamillionaire: Diamond-Diamond Rangs 2x]

(Rasaq)
[Ay, Yeah, Rasaq boy]
Look at my panky, look at my ring [ring]
Presto-Elocazine when I step on the scene [on the scene]
That's a magic show [magic show]
watch the baguettes glow
My mouth like a garden 18 carrots in a row [in a row]
Propped on vogues 22's on top of those
Top down slow while my popped trunk glow
What them boys talkin' bout my doors aqua blue [aqua blue]
When I park in my driveway it's a ocean front view [front view]
When I'm on the street, 22's spin around
Call the NFL my slab bout to touchdown [down]
Grippin' on pine [pine], and with them dollars on my mind [mind]
Platinum in my taste, nickel plate in my waistline [waistline]
Look at my panky hoe, look at my rocks [rocks]
Diamonds cuttin' blocks [blocks] same size as a X-Box [X-Box]
Boys try to hate but they be fake and when they speak it's hater-ation
They too cheap to imitate him so they get the imitations
I'm demostratin' how to get Benjamin Franklin's
And red-bones achin' for immediate penetration
Presidential paper got me past the mayor
alligator in my Navigator anaconda in my LeSabre
Second-graders chase the slab like it's a new flavor
peach-cobbler on the door while my seats vanilla wafer [MAN!]

(Hook - Rasaq)
Ay you could tell by my [pinky rang that I'm so throwed]
Ay, Uh-Ey - Ay you could tell by my [pinky rang that I pull hoes]
Ay, Uh-Ey - Ay you could tell by my [pinky rang that I'm so cold]
Ay, Uh-Ey - Ay [Chamillionaire: Diamond-Diamond Rangs 2x]

(Rasaq)
Look at my pinky, look at my ring [ring]
Bet ya see it glow [glow], bet you see it gleam [gleam]
Diamonds cuttin' corners like the crease in my jeans [in my jeans]
Ice as a white as styrofoam when niggaz sip the lean [sip the lean]
Lookin' so cold in my throwed bezantine
I'ma pull a star when I step on the scene [scene]
Teeth lookin' clean [clean], it's not listerine
guls starin' in my mouth like it's built wit' TV screens [TV screens]
I asked Vanna White, to give my 3 V's
Vivica, VVS's, and a V-12 machine
The first ones a fox [fox]
The second ones a rock [rock]
The third is a coupe with a roof with no top [top]
I pull it off the lot, trunk gon' pop
Grip the steerin'-wheel with my pinky on top
It means that it's propped [propped]
propped in the air
Just so you can see it
yeah nigga get a stare [get a stayaare]
You should catch a glimpse, nigga I'ma pimp
I got princesses' so that makes me a prince
My collar gettin' pinched, I slide on twenty inch
I iced out my ring froze off my finger-prints [MAN!]

(Hook - Rasaq)
Ay you could tell by my [pinky rang that I'm so throwed]
Ay, Uh-Ey - Ay you could tell by my [pinky rang that I pull hoes]
Ay, Uh-Ey - Ay you could tell by my [pinky rang that I'm so cold]
Ay, Uh-Ey - Ay [Chamillionaire: Diamond-Diamond Rangs 4x]</pre>
