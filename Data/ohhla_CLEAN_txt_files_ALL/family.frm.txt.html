Intro: 
A tale of two cities. Right here.

Nature:
It's time we set it straight connect with Dre the correct way
Predicting platnum in less then a day
So for that we amound us while y'all lackin' hope
All I do is write raps stack relax and smoke
Seeing my dreams come true stayin' humble in the eyes of others
Politician with the wisest brothers
It's Nature one of the greatest peep how I play this
Straight from the Bridge one of your kids favorites
From not till the day that I'm stiff fowl flagerant pay the rent 
Always stay swift, stuck in my ways type shovanistic
Since a youth I had a thing for big jewels
Flooded rings and older bitches holding my riches 
In lump sums for trust funds fully recoved thugs lust to bust guns
While niggas get drunk beat wifes and cuss sons
A slow process called life, let's show progress

Dre:
Don Cortes, white rags cherry bently
Cop shines from Italy speak money language fluently
Never fuck with the nastiest flashiest
Bought a house as big as Scarface to show my happyness
Rackin' the 6 0's for those that want to get personal to home
Cock the heavy metal rollin' with my stones
Prominent with flashy garments spread a mill small bills
Bring a smile to an ill grill
Popular loved throughout the industry 
If they sue light a philly cause the judge has gotta Free Willy
Solute with chill Remy gently escort four ladies an arm
The four caesers at he club Pentleys condo sweets I'm fancy
20 floors up overlookin' ladies boomerang they panties
Bump the Firm Family's latest takin' trips to Las Dregas
That's how we do it Aftermath incorperated

Hook:
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon it's the motherfuckin' Frim Family ooh
Yeah, I better pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming
Ooh cause the way you make me feel I feel like ooh screaming

Nature:
I spit rhymes for the radio and spit for tours
Spend doe that I never thought I'd hold before
Now if you just wanna front, you know my styles tight
Niggas never should of plugged up the motherfuckin' mic
Sippin' Tangeray 60 inch screen when we hang with Dre
I just flew in from Queens no bag and plan to stay
In the heat park this Royals Royce up in the beat
Seeing topless bitches rollerblading in the street

Dr. Dre:
While I lounge in a jacousy sky cliff blue got the whole crew
Nas, AZ, Nature, Foxy there too, how we do?
Hit trees Cristal bottles, breeze tropical spread love till we wobble
It's time to give let the kids live comfortable
Anybody pumpin' between the East and West...fuck you
Make moves political hit this revenue
Set examples respect every individual

Hook (x1.5)
