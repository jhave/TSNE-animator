[Lil Wayne]
Yeah
She got that good good, she Michael Jackson "Bad"
I'm attracted to her, for her attractive ass
She got that good good, she Michael Jackson "Bad"
I'm-I'm attracted to her...

[Lil Wayne]
Uhh, she a monster, I'm her sponsor
She run through my head, Chris Johnson
I'ma tackle her, get in back of her
Bust it open suck that pussy like the Dracula
What your man doing? Tell him fall back
Throw that pussy at me, baseball bat
I kiss her where she point, I make her lose her voice
I see her when I want; call that Viewer's Choice
#1 lover, she want none other
Don't need another one, when we got one another
I take her out, then I take her down
I beat it up, twelve round

[Chorus One: Lil Wayne]
She-she got that good good
She got that-got that good
She got, she got that, got that
She-she got that good good, she Michael Jackson "Bad"
I'm attracted to her, with her attractive ass

[Chorus Two: Lil Twist - repeat 2X]
Ok I'm watchin you baby, and thinkin 'bout all of the things
that I can do baby, on top of the world
when I'm on top of you baby, spend the night with me
and get popular baby, po-popular baby

[Lil Wayne]
Uhh, she a monster, but I'm a beast though
Take her clothes off, with my teeth though
I beat slow, or I can hit it fast
I do it how she ask, and I cum last
I bust her ass, we tear it down
Then I gotta split, like James Brown
It's all love, I come back around
And if she back it up, then-then I back it down
Tell me somethin is you ready for me baby?
Take this beast up out my pants and let you pet it for me baby
My dick on Professor Klump jump on this Eddie for me baby
And when uou fuck with me they give you credit for it baby
Yeah

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Lil Wayne]
Uhh she got that good good, she Michael Jackson "Bad"
I'm attracted to her, for her attractive ass
So pack your bags, I fly you in
Soon as she land, we get it in
She love to put her legs around my neck
I promise if I fuck her hard then she gon' choke me to death
Heh~! And it's always wet
Don't know if she the "Best I Ever Had"
but she the best I had yet!

[Chorus Two] - one half

[Lil Wayne]
YEAH!!

[Lil Twist] + (Lil Wayne)
Hey, and you'll get popular baby (Lil Twist!)
And like a cradle I'll be rockin you baby (yeah)
I feel good when I'm on top of you baby
So I'ma stay on top of you baby, hey

[Lil Wayne] + (Lil Twist)
You'll be popular baby
Hey, I'll be rockin you baby (hey!)

And I'ma stay on top of you baby
Ha ha ha (hey!)
