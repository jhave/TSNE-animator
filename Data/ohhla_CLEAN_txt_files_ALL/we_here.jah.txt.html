[Intro]
Yeah,
Here we go, feel this shit,
Into the new world, the new day
Ja Rule, Irv Gotti, nigga,
Its Murda . . .

[Chorus by Irv Gotti]
Yea we here now, don't get scared now
Ja Rule nigga bout to tear shit down
What y'all thought y'all was gon eat forever
And my dog wouldn't blaze heat for chedda
We better eat together or meet at da crossroad
Cause the Lord knows It's Murda, hold those
When yo casket close and yo soul rise high
Remeber the DEAD dont die less they FUCK WIT I !!!

[Ja Rule]
Niggaz know who dope yo
Shit the flow is retched
And my gee too futuristic for you hoes to catch it
I'm a god send, the fallen angel and I do sin
Far from perfection but still considered a gem
Thank you lord for givin' me wind beneath my wings
When the miracle spittin there shall be no witnesses to da pain 
And my ignorance, I charge to da game
So many love and slain by bullets wit dead aim
I weathered the change.
Stormed through the streets in the range
Can't complain, a nigga live to die in da flames
Cause I torture, J to A  R-U-L-E
Niggaz cant be seriously fuckin' wit me.
What you Holla bout 
We can hit up an alley and air out
Bullets exit the barell, and enter your mouth
Dat's how I'm built
Under da floss there's nuttin but filth
Don't let it fool ya 
I still let these slugs heat up and cool ya
Off forever more, so help me,
Lord gona find a way to my grave just because I'm a Mur-der-a
Whole not part
Cut me open 
I bleed for da I.N.C. from da heart
When I start it's usually endless.
Pop one wit gloves on 
Make you check fo forensic, son 
In yo appendix, son, you got hit up HuH?
Fuckin wit Ja you know it's MURDAAA

Chorus

[Ja Rule]
Rule spits monotonous, hot as apocalypse
Now you eyin dis ferocious mic supremist
Whose limits is endless
This nigga here done risen
Murderous flowz killed suspicion
Niggaz is too light in the ass to be shittin
Hollis Ave. historical, Nigga respect tradition
Cause all I see is bloodshed and niggaz wanna see me dead 
Inherit dis style is sumtin like a million square miles (CHANGE IT UP)
Till I - find em and hit em and be done wit em 
Givin is gettin and niggaz get got for bullshittin
I'ma run up on niggaz gunnin em down
And you confess dat I'm da best so who's touchin me now?
Shipped three hundered thou wit a freestyle, fuckin you up 
And got you hoes in da back rows tossin it up
I got da touch cause my flow is bananas
Bitches can't stand us, we ghetto fabulous
Aim when I bust and blast on surprise
If y'all niggaz don't know you need to see me live 
I'm like two .45's spittin in every direction
Y'all niggaz is hoes in stilletos and thongs (NIGGA)
It's a break of a new day (yeah)
May-be you'll get to see violently (yeah)
What drives me (yeah) take 'em back to da gutter (yeah)
Smother the world in filth (uh-huh)
Rule's da name and now you gon see how I'm built.. nigga 
 
Chorus

[Ja Rule]
