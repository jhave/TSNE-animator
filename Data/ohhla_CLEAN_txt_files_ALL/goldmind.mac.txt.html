Typed by: Davida.b.

[Chorus 2X: Shabazz the Disciple]
We on the slow grind, moving as one, but it's four minds
Putting in that work from sound check to showtime
Fuck to po-line, the judge, the p-o's, the whole nine
Go head, go sign, man we about to peel a gold mine

[Shabazz the Disciple]
King of Israel, name rings bells, I'm here to fish scale
Play the hand I'm delt while lands ?holler miss deal?
Bring hell, poisen snow flake on some quick sales
Never plead ball, hit the bar and spen a ?spit pill?
Peep pimp tales, naked flicks with your chick's tail
Gucci smelling lipstick, she love how the dick feels
Keep scales, that shit fails, then we set sail
Empty out the fuckers, hit the coppers than we split sales
Plundered in prison, another soul of a brother has risen
Same gang up, some hang up over a judge's decision
Some niggas yank, spit shanks, others hug a religion
We spit it on a higher plane, agnets hover your vision

[Chours 2X]

[Timbo King]
Yo it's hammer time, from Atalanta all the way to Anaheim
Women stand in line, greet the king, meet the king
Don never hand cuffing hoes, left three daddy roles
Rocking Prada, popping lava, assalama, black pirhanas
Eat food, street dudes, keep tools
Word to your hower, black power, it's the final hour
I went from Martin to Malcolm to recording albums
Soul signing, so melodic, lemon kush, gold chronic
Reap profits, keep profits, keep your hands out my pockets
Yeah, Bo King kicking off, off top
You got to pay off, ain't no shots involved
Cus you don't want the 357 involved

[Hell Razah]
They want beef, we the Burger Kings
Maccabeez, we official, we murder things
Sleep, don't hurt our slang, no gang, we a family tree
From the seeds, to the roots, to the branches and leaves
Label me as a farmer that be growing them trees
Better yet, a carpenter, cus of them hammers I squeeze
Got tools like I'm Home Depot
Hypnotic and that Grey Goose make all them hoes deep throat
Take two pulls to choke shorty, pass the dro
Cross my line, guarenteed you rats is blown
I'm letting you know, you'll never be rich or out poor
I'm a restaurant, raising cooks styles to go

[Chorus 2X]

[Killah Priest]
King Tut rock the Gucci frames, my Uzi rings
Like it's '88, sitting on top of Section 8
Thoro, my step is my borough, spit out brimstone and fire
Apocalypse rap, go with the flow ?novel? through tracks
The marvelous is back, King David waving two gages
Dropping bombs like I'm Arab all over your radars
I'm the poet, the prophet, the preacher, the priest
Songs of survival are sinister, the sin is the streets
Powerful from a gangsta lip, two or three years
I live that Passion of Christ before we all leave here
It's leap year for you rappers who thought you had it
Millenium magic, that's the devil's work ya'll practice
My gat spits at your dragons, clips from a magnum
Call out niggas on the floor, they all crawl out</pre>
