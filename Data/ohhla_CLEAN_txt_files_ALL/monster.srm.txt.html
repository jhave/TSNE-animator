Typed by: DeRockus@juno.com

Run for the hills cause the mack is back
I'm hookin' up girls by fact
If you're stacked 
You can rub a big mack
I gotta gas 
So don't worry about scraps 
(no, no)
Five foot eleven with a seven foot game
Gotta big mouth piece and I show no shame
Monster kinky have no morals
Monster loves to get oral (ummmm!)
Got ten cars and the girls like that
I was born and bred to be a mack
Once your sign is played 
You gotta put a style in your game now a days
In the sixty's girls was all hot 
LSD had 'em given up thigh
The baby boom was on I drop
No more woodstock but now you got Mix-A-Lot
So put me in your CD changer
Watch your girl cause Mix's a re-arranger
Ooo, he's sexist 
Doo, he's sexist 
Keepin Rush Limbaugh restless
Well I'm da' mack and thats monster
Straight chase girls through the tail cause I wants to
You can call it wack
But you respect this black 
When it comes to game I'm a monster mack

-Chorus:
Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
Big Mack, Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
I'm a monster mack
Lookin for sex
Bih bih bih big big mack

Strike the pose
But she aint nasty as me
Cause Mix-A-Lot is stuck on freaky 
Can't stop tappin that tweety 
Give it to the needy
Nope, cause I'm too damn greedy
Here I go walking through the mall
Don't play ball
But I got game for 'em all
Focus on a victim, Focus on a victim
Mr. Richard is hot so lets sick em
And like a tomahawk jumpin on a skillet
Girl you got to gimp my puhh
The pick up king is back buddy 
Tryin to give lessons to these thick ass ballers and understudies
I'm not tryin to call you no bitch girl
Don't give a damn if your poor or rich girl
And we can play a pool
And I'm pokin that 8-ball cool
And the bootys
I still like the bootys
She got a little waist doin squats just to keep me on my duty
Giant size games what I droppin
Straight freaks with these thick ol' gluts is what I'm knockin
Now the right wing wanna test me 
If likin sex is a crime then you arrest me
But don't tell me who to sing to Jack 
Cause a third of your life is in the sack
I'm a monster mack

-Chorus-

Drivin my car by the bus stop
Till I spot a young cutie straight suckin down a soda pop
Baby girl's winkin
Mix-A-Lot's thinkin
Hope this girl's feet aint stankin
Here we go 
Swing by Franglors
Get a little Soul Food
Now you got a brother in the mood
Damn gotta get her home with the quickness
For this warriors a witness
No need to put my girls on tilt
Cause straight up game will get your milk
The nasty dog is back 
With straight pimp game black
Aint no shame 
I'm a monster mack

-Chorus-</pre>
