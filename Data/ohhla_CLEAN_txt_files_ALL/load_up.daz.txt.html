[Daz Dillinger]
Diggy Daz about to surface like hot air balloons
Leaves and platoons, hoes and harlots, hoes and Harley's
D-A to the Z, rock with that double-barrel shotty in the gangsta party
I'ma do what I'm 'bout to do, hoe what about you?
And them other two, and them other two
D.P.G.C. vital, liable to smother you (that's right)
Undercover in a bucket like fuck it
What them real niggaz got to say to them bitch niggaz boy?
This gangsta shit
And I'ma be the first runnin' up, blastin' with the gun tucked
Blastin' the suckas 'til niggaz get chipped
I'm a fanatic, somatic, 24-sev fool
Dippin' in a Cutlass, two P's in a bucket
(Yo Daz, homie won't you tell these niggaz somethin')
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party motherfucker!

[Chorus]
Load Up, Load Up
(Load Up)..
Load Up, Load Up
(Blast, blast, blast, blast, blast)
Load Up, Load Up
(Load Up)..
Load Up, Load Up
(Blast, blast)

[Daz Dillinger]
Chevy, with a buck-fifty horses for the forces
Breakin' homies and seperatin' like divorces
I'ma show you G, to a T
D-O double G the P-O-U-N to the D
We'll leave you motionless
D.P.G. and me, are the only G's these hoes came to see
Work that thang girl, pop that azz
You are now cultivated by the sounds of Daz
And - all my gangsta niggaz keep on smashin' on these bitches
And we hittin', hittin' switches on three in a 'Llac
If you're lookin' for us gangstas, then we in the back
With the all grey and blue on, D.P.G. on the hat
They call me Daz Dilly bitch, loco, more she intact
And at that get your lungs collapsed, perhaps you prefer that
(For my G's gleamin', candy paintin'
 ridin', rollin', smashin', dashin'
 indo hashin', any get wit me)
I thought I told you that

[Chorus]
Load Up, Load Up
(Load Up)..
Load Up, Load up
(Blast, blast, blast, blast, blast)
Load Up, Load Up
(Load Up)..
Load Up, Load up
(Load Up, Load Up, Load Up, Load Up)

I was about to hit these switches on low-low's
With Dat Nigga Daz, D.P.G. Original
Niggaz high as a kite
Got the whole world shakin' like a Dogg Pound Gangsta
Shit, yeah yeah

[Daz Dillinger]
Man, sit, let me spit - a little game to you
Let me introduce my homie to you
You're just a hype, mush me out
Unleash on these hoes
Turn into a motherfuckin' beast on these hoes
Get your head right, game right, aim right
Get everything right, with all your might
Or you might not see daylight, AK might spray your night
The total eclipse at night
The force is fly (high), shootin' out shit that scorch the sky
Stops at the sparks that fly
I'ma forcified, and I'm forced to try
With all my might to get the force to fly
Bigg Snoop, demands we stay on point like Stacey Adams (Dogghouse!)
I'm bumpin' parliament and then Yolanda Adams
I'm just dippin' that's all, I'm just dippin'
D-A to the Z on point and I ain't trippin', c'mon

[Chorus]
Load Up, Load Up
(Load Up)..
Load Up, Load Up
(Blast, blast, blast, blast, blast)
Load Up, Load Up
(Load Up)..
Load Up, Load Up
(Load Up... c'mon)
