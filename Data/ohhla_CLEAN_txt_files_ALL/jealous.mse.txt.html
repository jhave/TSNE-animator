[Mase]
You know, there's a lot of jealous guys in this town
And many other towns I go to,  (ah yeah)
But I'm afraid right now I'm so hurt
I'mma need 112 and Puff, to help me explain how I feel
So come on fellas, help me out

	[112]
1 - 	Ladies
	There's some jealous guys in our town, oh baby            
	Ladies
	There's some jealous guys in our town, oh baby            

[Mase]
Well, well, well
Now would you be mad if I gave back your girl
Or would it still be a problem with the entire Harlem World
At first you were singing that she was your ex
But you was ready to kill me when you found out we had sex
When I came and told you the deal
You wouldn't admit how you feel
Now you know your girl love me
Why can't you just let it be (just let it be)

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Puff]
I go by the name Puff Daddy
And I'm a Scorpio, check this out
Girl I really hope you find a new lover
Cuz Mase can't take no more of you fuckin' him and his brotha,  ut uh
And girl what make you think you could do what you do
And think that we'll be standing here fighting over you, come on
When I came and told him the deal
He wouldn't admit how he feel
Now he know his girl love me
Why can't he just let it be (just let it be)

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Puff Daddy]
As I said before, I go by the name of Puffy Daddy
And I'm a Scorpio and I'm not a jealous guy
Come on sing for me Mase

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Mase]
You see if we had more pimps, it wouldn't be no jealous guys
See me, I live by the four pimp rules
Number one, you control the situation
You get in they head before you get in they bed
And number two, girls run like buses, you may miss one
Catch another one every  hour on the hour, promptly
And number three, what that girl ain't willin' to do
You got a hundred more girls more than willin'
And number four, is a  new rule to the new pimp testament
You can't be a playa and hate the playas
That don't make no sense
I don't wanna see no more jealous guys at the end of this song  ya'll
I really don't wanna see no more jealous guys after this song  ya'll
So can ya'll sing along with me
I mean put your hands together, sing along  ya'll , sing along everybody

Repeat 1 until fade while:

[Mase]
I just really wanna come and let you know
Girl you just got to let them go 
Cuz there jealous guys, jealous guys, in our town
And it's gonna show ,love is gonna show
It's gonna show, oh baby it's gonna show, oh oh
It's gonna show, it's gon', it's gon', it's gonna show
And you is a jealous guy in our town
In our town, in our town
oh baby, oh yeah, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Well, well, well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well, well
Where do you go when there's jealous guys in our town

[Puff  Daddy]
Now that's the end of our discussion
To all the player haters and player hatetts
Mase, Harlem World, Puff Daddy and 112
Telling you to be a lover and not a hater, you'll get further in life
May God bless you  and good night</pre>
