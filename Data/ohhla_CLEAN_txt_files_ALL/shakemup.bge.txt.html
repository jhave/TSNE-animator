[Mac]
Nigga ride with me, ride with me, die with me, die with me
Kill with me, kill with me, bury me a soldier
Don't nobody cry, just keep my name in the sky
Tattoo me, retaliate on them niggas that do me
Back to life, this No Limit shit I represent that
You resent that, you meet my nigga dirty black, that's what I call the gat
Shell sheezie, ask my nigga B Neezie
Big Man, Big Champ, Big Hurt, don't make them killers go to work
&gt;From the south to the east to the middle to the west
Represent your hood, show me where them killers at

[Big Ed]
We some soldiers at war, some bout it bout it killers
Represent the tank dogs, street thugs and guerrilas
I aint forgot about my niggas, trigger toters and convicts
San Jose, Frisco, Oak Town and the Rich
Killer Cali be the shit, fuckin with these Down South Hustlers
Got Kane and Abel from the east, midwest be servin them cluckers
No Limit soldier at heart, got TRU on my veins
Now it's tapes and CD's, used to be herion and cocain

[C-Murder]
I'm a motherfuckin fool, respect everything a nigga drop
No Limit run the world nigga, we can't be stopped
Like a blast from my sawed off fool, ha, I'm deadly
Do you really wanna test me nigga, I said I'm crazy
Society done made my whole click go insane
I done seen so many thug figures die in vain
I'm protected by a motherfuckin click full of riders
TRU niggas don't fall off with that tank right beside ya

[Lil Gotti Gambino]
I'm a shake these motherfuckers up, believe that
With my family in this bitch niggas bustin with the mini mac
Flash backs of crooked niggas crossin my tie
Lord forgive me but these bitch made burn to die
Give me a forty five, I'm a let this pistol unload
And let the world know, I shake em up fa sho
And I ride with these Gambinos, ????? Feino

[Fieno Gambino]
Uh, shake em up, wet em up, pick em up
Fuckin with these made niggas who don't give a fuck
Now you stuck, layin on your back flat line
Fuckin with Fieno, do one the boss they call ???
Bullets be flyin, closed caskets from automatics
Lives be drastic, these niggas be endin up in plastic
Shit is drastic, mad these niggas ain't laughin
And they wonder why a nigga like me keep on blastin
