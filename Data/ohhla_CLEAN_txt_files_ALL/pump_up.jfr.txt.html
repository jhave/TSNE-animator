[Fresh Prince]
In the place to be
DJ Jazzy Jeff and yours truly the Fresh Prince
Ay Jeff, do me a favor, give em just a lil' TOUCH of the bass
Not a lot, just a lil' touch Jeff

Word word
Ay Jeff do me a favor man, Jazz it up

Now bring it all back

Yo man now break it down and let me go for mine

When I first started out, Jeff used to come to my house
Just as soon as school let out, he used to
come to my crib, and you know what we did?
We bugged out like two little kids, word
Jeff on the wheels, and me on the M.I.C.
A better combination there could never be
So let's go back, for old time's sake
Yo Jeff! (WHAT?) Pump up the bass!

I . like . my . music . loud!
The volume, pumpin, the kickdrum thumpin
The people jumpin, up out there seats
when this record comes on, you think something's wrong
The bass is too strong
You don't have to check your record, it's not defective
It's just the way we wanted it, pump it, get it?
We like it loud, strong like a magnum force
I am the lyricist, Jeff is the rhythm source
This combination, is virtually omnipotent
That means invincible, you know, dominant
So don't you cross our path, just stay out our face
Or we'll knock you down, pump up the bass!

Yo Jeff man, how bout a funky scratch

Now get funky with it

Now bring in the snare

Now break it down and bring it all back to me

Now pump up the bass!

I'm hyped -- psyched up
and I'm flowin, so come on let's go in
to the next segment, of this hip-hop fantasy
You say this can't be happening, why can't it be?
It's an equation, mathematically correct
It's Jeff + Prince, equals, hit records
Sounds too easy?  Word, I know it does
You wanna know why?  Well yo it's cause
me and Jeff, oh, Jeff and I, excuse me
blend like Kool-Aid, and flow like an uzi
That's why we can't be taken or broken or braken, whatever
And if you think we can, you're mistaken, we're clever
cause all we did to make this record a hit
was turn down the treble, pump up the bass kit
at the same time the volume was increased
adding more strength, to this masterpiece
of poetry, by now you know it's me
Poet, creativity, pushin, to out destiny
I am on the M-I-C, Jeffery is the Disc Jockey
? keep us company, the human beat box Ready C
Backed up by a family, and that is all we need
so that we can be successful as we want to be
The future is in front of me so here is a taste
of the future of hip-hop Jeff, pump up the bass!

Yo Jeff one more scratch man

Ready Rock C man, give Jeff a hand</pre>
