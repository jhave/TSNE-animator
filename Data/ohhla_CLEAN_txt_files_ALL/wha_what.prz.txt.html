(Pras)
Uh, yeah, huh, yeah
Yo, yo, yo, I'll do a double dish cleaner 
The funny ass cats remind me of a skinner
Now you listen up, now what, heat on spitter
A renegade with my blade watch you get cut up
Sucker ass punk, you used to get beat up 
Type of dude that'll smoke your weed up and eat up
Hold up, surrender your squad, it's a stick up
Fifty-two pickup, you high school drop-out, gives you enough float 
To succeed or get tighter, what up, your block, get up 
Shut up, or put up I'ma bout to let up 
Licky, licky here, two shots you gone lick up 
Take her to the news under: You should've eased up
Wha' What Wha' you got me fed up, get up or shut the f up 
You done f'ed up, 8 or 9 enough even if she has seven runner up
Like the fans, like your thumbs up, what up?
I make them bowl like Shopper Ranks 
I'm the Captain of the Ship, make them cats walk the plank 
What the f you think I'm point, point blank
Turn off my sound niggas, let... crank 

(Chorus w/variations)
East Side where you at, where you at?
West Side throw it up, throw it up
North Side where you at, where you at?
South Side throw it up, throw it up

See, blaze me above the game with no limit
Niggas nowadays can slick and pull gimmicks 
Cowber use roly well iced that been in it 
Mines is loose rocks and the Beverly spin in it 
Only place tin linid they cost a lot 
When no money on the game you sure talk a lot 
Never like a nigga car, you walk a lot 
See I make cream a lot, while you niggas dream a lot 
Can't you see it's all real, bras want to do me 
Get it attached to me like I'm starrin in movies 
Nigga Nor wanna do me, thing is I got none 
Wanna be my main chick, chill I got one 
If it's hot in a lady then I can cop some
Most players all fall, tightly tint
See me fly through the window cause it's lightly tint 
But its strongly minute got a fall so cats frequent
Hate weed peepin, best cats seekin
Wanna kill me in the daytime, look it won't happen 
You ain't a thug nigga this is some girls is rap, what
(Yeah you don't won't no problem)

(Chorus w/variations)
East Side where you at, where you at?
West Side throw it up, throw it up
North Side where you at, where you at?
South Side throw it up, throw it up

Yo my M-O is S-O-L-O... hello
Shake like Jello bionics and nice fellow 
Long hair, pussy's and pussy head too
In a room with the doctor, how the hell I stop ya?
The Rolex topper long as ya coppin them yo 
It means it's copper, don't need to stop ya 
When I'm speakin opera, which y'all don't understand 
That it's my channel Boo-Bionic mister man
Why y'all play Tennis we sway inventists
So our house can finish, wait a minute 
Change the color of my whips, despite you bastards 
Spit it green-cold on it, like you won the masters 
Flow... faster, speed it up, heat it up why don't y'all just heat it up 
Spit it on some feeder bust, slow it up, make the beat that we blow it up 
Ya niggaz ain't mine, better pray you throw it up 

(Chorus w/variations)
East Side where you at, where you at?
West Side throw it up, throw it up
North Side where you at, where you at?
South Side throw it up, throw it up
Now...

(Pras)
Yo I keep my mind on my riches snitches get snitches 
Cats on the low they all act like bitches 
So what up, where you at with the nine-sin?
Feel my triples please circle the violence 
Let me abolish this sh... like Nat Turner 
Drop by Tom Warner, peace to my crooked cop killers 
with the six shooter while fake niggaz getting drunk off of wine coolers
Yo, uh...

Yo she big on the game it's broke I wanna fix it 
Make hot... and get that down, we remix it 
He speakin, here we go your beef is nice
I'm from the gutter mother... best you think twice 
Now back to who's nice M-O-S-T-W-A-N-T-E-D
You niggaz can't see me I'm glad that you turn 
Poke that out of space shit, I bring you back to Earth, what 

(Chorus w/ varaiations)
East Side where you at, where you at?
West Side throw it up, throw it up
North Side where you at, where you at?
South Side throw it up, throw it up
East Side where you at, where you at?
West Side throw it up, throw it up
North Side where you at, where you at?
South Side throw it up, throw it up
