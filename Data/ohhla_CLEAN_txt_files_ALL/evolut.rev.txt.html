Typed by: Nature2QBC@aol.com 

*sample from The Matrix* 

"Which is of course what is all about... 
Evolution...evolution, like the dinosaur... 
Look out that window; you had your time 
The future is our world" 

"Evolution" "Is the day you're my target" *cut up and repeated 3x* 

[Evidence] 
I be the first to tell you when it comes to drum 
Turnin up your snare too loud wears out your welcome 
I'm not trippin on cats who wanna jack my hats 
I do the same, do solo on your shit, is open game 
I never understood those who sold out for Benz 
Some say I do too much, burn candles at both ends 
But still I play the back, cuz when I don't do that, attacks 
The fatter the cuts, the fatter the track 
And fat tracks important as clear mics 
Some are sureshots but most are prototypes 
Post your snipes all over Babylon 
You're too spaced out, sound requires air to travel on 
Pack the bags, another mission to complete 
But first I set my ground work here on the street 
Do you like the way I vocalize? 
Then bring it to a compromise 
My DJ won't settle till noon, it's evolution 

[Chorus] 
"Evolution" "Is the day you're my target" 
"Evolution is a cycle to turn, vital to learn" [Iriscience] 
"Evolution" "Is the day you're my target" 
"To evolve, please evolve with self respect" [Chuck D] 
"Evolution" "Is the day you're my target" 
"Evolution is a cycle to turn, vital to learn" 
"Evolution" "Is the day you're my target" 
"To evolve, please evolve with self respect" 

"Look to fuck some stuff up, and rip another rough cut" 
"Evidence" [Canibus] 
"And Revolution" 
"Wha-what what" [Noreaga] 

[Evidence] 
I tell em all',Too many words in a verse don't sound fresh' 
Instead... 
"I slow flows ya'll to death" [Jay-Z] 
And if you chillin where you are, 
then don't complain on how you got there 
"I get the paper so I don't care" [Milk D] 
Too many play it close but ain't really on the team 
US'd at twenty-six, Vietnam'd at nineteen 
"Nineteen" *cut and scratched* 
With my DJ like that, yo killin the one's and two's 
Got no choice but to 
"Grab the microphone and get loose" [Iriscience] 
Ah, crews say my name, respect the street fame 
Plus my tracks aim to 
"Blow ya outta the frame" [OC] 
And if you feel we done ya done wrong 
You can seek restitution, then 
"Spend three sixty degrees" 
For evolution 

Chorus
