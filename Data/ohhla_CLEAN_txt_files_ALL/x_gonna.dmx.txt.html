Arf arf
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Grrrr)
Uh, Yeah don't get it twisted
This rap shit, is mine
Motherfucker, it's not, a fucking, game
Fuck what you heard
It's what you hearin
It's what you hearin (Listen)
It's what you hearin (Listen)
It's what you hearin (Listen)

[Verse 1]
X gon' give it to ya
Fuck wait for you to get it on your own
X gon' deliver to ya
Knock knock, open up the door, it's real
Wit the non-stop, pop pop and stainless steel
Go hard gettin busy wit it
But I got such a good heart
I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it
Damn right and I'll do it again
Cuz I am right so I gots to win
Break bread wit the enemy
But no matter how many cats I break bread wit
I'll break who you sendin me
You motherfuckers never wanted nothin, but your life saved
Bitch, and that's on a light day
I'm gettin down, down like a nigga said FREEZE!
But won't be the one endin up on his knees (woo)
Bitch please, if the only thing you cats did
was came out to play - stay out my way

[Chorus 2X: DMX]
First we gonna ROCK, then we gonna ROLL
Then we let it POP, GO LET IT GO
X gon' give it to ya
He gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya
He gon' give it to ya

[Verse 2]
Ain't never gave nothin to me
But everytime I turn around
Cats got they hands out wantin something from me
I ain't got it so you can't get it
Lets leave it at that cuz I ain't wit it
Hit it wit full strength, I'm a jail nigga
So I face the world like it's Earl in the bullpen
You against me, me against you
Whatever, whenever - nigga, fuck you gon' do?
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
Only nigga that you know that can chill
Come back and get the streets open
I've been doing this for nineteen years
Niggas wanna fight me? Fight these tears
I put in work and it's all for the kids
But these cats done forgot what work is (UH-HUH!)
They don't know who we be
Lookin! but they don't know who they see

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Aiyyo where my niggaz at?!
I know I got them down in the game
Give 'em love and they give it back
Talk too much for too long
Don't give up you're too strong (What?!)
Dub to the wow wow honeys (yeah!)
Shoutout to niggaz that done it
And it ain't even about the dough
It's about gettin down for what you stand for yo

[Chorus]</pre>
