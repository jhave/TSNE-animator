What
Talked about who rips it right
Always keep a crowd goin like a schoolyard fight
Always hold it down lovely when it's time to bulid
Been doin musical chairs like Levert, Sweat, and Gill
Who doubt me niggas on the internet shout me
Playin me close or leave your bitter house stout b
Pullin chips if it's a bet you want
I'll demolish you and your fuckin debutom boy
Talkin bout she rap now y'all niggas is sick
I'll be milky like ways or milky like wick or
Whatever type phrase rappers choose to model
I'll take it right from you then have my peoples rob you
Flunky , all the stations gon pump me
Street shit I show another face like humpty
Niggas , that's my word is bon
We gon hit you with the heat like you motherfucking Spawn

CHORUS: Rampage and Rah Digga
This is what happens
When you fuck with my clique
This is what happens
When you bitin niggas shit
This is what happens
When you can't make a hit
This is what happens , this is what happens , this is what happens
When you fuckin wit my crew
This is what happens
What a nigga 'posed to do
This is what happens
We got street shit to
This is what happens , this is what happens

[Rampage]
Nowadays MC's get kicked to the curb (curb)
Rampage I'ma spark y'all that's my word
Me and Digga we in the game that's superb (perb)
Gettin all the money and plaques on reserve (uh)
When I'm in Y.O. with Swizz and the Ruff Ryders (or)
I'm chillin in the Bricks with Zee and the Outsidaz (sidaz)
All you other cliques be frontin y'all dick riders (riders)
You damn right I got the whole enchiladas (ladas)
Drinkin iced teas plus , pina coladas (ladas)
My Flipmode niggas we be the Brooklyn Globetrotters (trotters)
Now I'm seein chips like Erica Strata
Yo my favorite rap album was Tribe, Midnight Marauders (uh)
I'm takin you back like Afrikaa Bambattaa
I'm hittin you , hittin you with the force (force)
Catch me in the VIBE , Rap City , or The Source
Source , source , source
Motherfucker

CHORUS

[Rampage]
Rampage , I'm the biggest thing in life (life)
Don Juan , shut down your pentagon (gon)
Watch me get the millions , with my Flipmode affilions
Like Vodka , fuck up your liver watch I deliver (liver)
Your body decompose in the river
Pass through like cold breeze feel your body shiver (shiver)
Microphone killer, finga on the trigga , Ramp to Rah Digga

[Rah Digga]
Digga
Gotta stay focused can't lose the drive
Help my moms and my pops quit they nine to five
Get it now for the c case I don't survive
That's why (that's why) that's why (that's why)
I'ma take all the crap that be in this game
And don't think I'm a bitch or succumb to fame
If I'm puffin on lah don't remember your name
That's why (that's why) that's why (that's why)

CHORUS

This is what happens
