(backwards talking)

Hoorakoo, feed the rats
Hoorakoo, skin the cats
Meckle Heckle Lucifer
Heckle Meckle crucifer
Meditate, body weight, humiliate, casterate
Contemplate, hate, decapitate, segragate
Poision, venom, vixon, pleasure
Vortex, vomit, vultures, treaures
Hex of fire, hex of pain
Hex of losses, hell will gain
Blood of children, blood of pig
Dig, Solomon, dig, dig
Dig your grave, be my slave!
Alotta wicked spirits, wave

Black is Magic leave my soul
Give my angles all control
Black is Magic let me be
Keep your black tongue off of me
Black is Magic drop your chain
May you never speak my name
Black is Magic watch you cowar
Bite your tongue and Holy power

Why...(why) when people witness magic
They'll ignore it and say it never happened
Only thing they'll believe is whats tragic
God throws it, nobody wanna catch it

I go east, you go west
And the moon follows both of us (magic)
Pyramids, circle crops
Hundred-ton stone hedge blocks (its magic)
Volcanic lava, earthquakes
Weather causes aches (magic)
Music love, the unseen drugs
Fuckin' lightening bugs (its magic)
Hypnosis, E.S.P.
Mental telepathy (magic)
Amityville, northern lights
Blood-red moonlit nights (its magic)
Rings of Saturn, the black hole
Mind over body control (magic)
Exercisms, Marys cryin'
Unknown objects flyin' (its magic)
Chorus

Why...(why) when people witness magic
They'll ignore it and say it never happened
Only thing they'll believe is whats tragic
God throws it, nobody wanna catch it

Frozen fire, calm me down
Frozen fire, show me around
Candle wax, drip like tears
For over 1,000 years
Monkey blood, scream and hide
Take me to my spot, cave!
Wage, Devil has my tongue
Heavens bells have now rung
(backwards talking)

Blood of children, blood of pig
Dig, Solomon, dig, dig
Dig your grave, be my slave
Let the Holy spirits RAVE
(Chorus &amp; backwards talking)</pre>
