Everybody needs a glass of water today
To chase the hate away
You know you've got company comin over
So you scrub extra-hard
And everybody needs somebody to love
Before its too late
Its too laaaaaaateee oh
Dont nobody wanna grow old alone!

Everybody needs someone to rub their shoulders
And scratch their dandruff
And everybody need to quit actin hard and shit
Before you get your ass whooped (I'll slap the fuck out ya!)
And everybody needs somebody to love
Before its too late
Its too late

Love-hater
Love-hater
Hater of love {*repeat 2X*}
Love-hater
Love-hater

(whispered) Everybody needs someone to love {*repeat 2X*}</pre>
