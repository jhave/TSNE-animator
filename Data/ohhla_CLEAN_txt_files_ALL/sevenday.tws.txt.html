[Intro: Twista]
Uhh, yeah, ay

Yo Toxic, tell 'em what we talkin 'bout

[Chorus: Toxic] + (Twista)
Call my connect {"On Monday"}
(What you got? Now what you got for me?)
I pick it up {"On a Tuesday"} yeah
(Bring it back, now bring it back for me)
Ohh, I cook it up on {"On Wednesday"}
(Go to the kitchen, get the pots, hit the stove nigga)
Shut them niggaz down {"On a Thursday yeah"}
(Y'all can't serve around here, you gotta go nigga)
Yeah, we on the tip {"Come Friday"} yeah
(Cash them checks, uhh, we on the set, uhh)
Police tried to sweat me {"That Saturday"}
(They let us go we hit the sto' then hit the club nigga)
We still tippin {"On Sunday"} yeah
(Seven days a week, that's how we do it cause we gots to eat)
 
[Twista]
The rap for the hood, if you want 'em I gram 'em
I'm Twista, I came back with the hustler's anthem
And these are crack hooks that I spit, I hope my customers chant 'em
Spit for niggaz in Caprises that can't pull up in the Phantom
That's real  like rocks and blows when I'm rockin them shows
On the blocks with them O's when I'm droppin them flows, cockin the low
When the Twista hit the scene and that's like BLAKA explode
These lyrics to the tracks is like workin them pots on the stove
That's real
 
[Hook: Twista]
I got cocaine if you really wanna {"buy buy"}
I got ounces if you really wanna {"buy buy"}
I got 'dro if you really wanna {"buy buy"}
Rocks blows if you really wanna {"buy buy"}
 
[Hook]
 
[Twista]
Give me a look-up, I got the good hook up on cook up
If you low I'll front you to try to help you get a foot up
Police on my ass so I had to move a little bit quicker before I get shook up
Shit it's all the way I had to book up 
makin money for my good ki with a good cut
I spit that Cali kush, in the alley you can push
And the ki I stay low-key so Detective O'Malley won't look
Everybody be watchin my shows, everybody be rockin my flows
Got yayo and that's the way shit goes nigga, O's nigga
 
[Hook]  2X
 
[Interlude: Toxic]
It's a seven day thing man
We do it all week e'ry week, we hustlin
Let me tell you how it goes again, aight?
 
[Chorus]
 
[Hook]  echoes at the end</pre>
