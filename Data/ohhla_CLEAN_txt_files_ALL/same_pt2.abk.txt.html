Song:   Same Thing, Pt. 2
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm as crazy as I wanna be, ain't no stopping me
Buck wild, tearing up the streets in the D
Just a native with some war paint actin a fool
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too

Smoking weed like it's free and the first to kill a 40
Only one to shoot a pistol in the middle of a party
Hanging on the block without a clue what to do
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too

I'm not sayin we no good just a little abnormal
Underground is where we lay, the main stream is too formal
I'm learning things they don't teach in the school
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too

[Chorus x2]
If you do what I do (Yea)
And I do what you do (Yea)
Wouldn't that kinda make us all the same (Yea)

Wait for the right time, patient like a snake
Slither to your enemy then show his ass some hate
This is just something that I like to do
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too

Always down with a BBQ, drinkin brew with the crew
Up til the sun come, way past curfew
Talking about things that I wanna pursue
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too

Never sit and argue, squash it with my tennis shoe
Kung-fu a motherfuckas head into fondue
That's how it is, and I'll never improve
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too

[Chorus x2]

I prefer Yager bombs instead of Absolute
But I'd rather have a blunt packed with purple or blue
Red skin with the hatchet running looking confused
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too

Ever since I was a youth in pursuit to amuse
Crassin(?) Avenue I cruise to promote my new
I did everything I could to make my name break through
And some of ya'll be doing the same things too

I was showing up late cause I had to finish smoking
You know how the weed have you in slow motion
Thank god I'm not alone because it wouldn't be cool
I'm so glad ya'll be doing the same things too

(What time, um, I thought this was tony from the block
Tonys' on after this rap)

[Chorus x2]

You do (yeah)
I do (yeah)
Wouldn't that kinda make us all the same? (yeah) (x2)
You do
I do
You do, come on put your hands up just like this
You do
I do
Yeah you old lady in the back, shake them hips grandma
You do
I do
Somebody in this bitch get me a drink. I'm thirsty
You do
I do (applause)
Yeah yeah thank you
(I told you no fucking rap)
Bitch shut up
Yeah thank you except you bitch
And you motherfucker
Yeah thank ya'll
Thank ya'll very much
Thank ya, thank ya
(You're fucking lucky)
Hey man shut up
(Next time)

What what
(oh you're lucky)
You owe me money, pay me damn
(for this shit)
Come on man
(Well uh give it up for that um rapper guy, yeah yeah, uh sti-
