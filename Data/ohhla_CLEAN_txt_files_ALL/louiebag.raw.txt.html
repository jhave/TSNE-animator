[Intro]
This it right here homie (say it aint so)
They told me to get my swag up (bloodraw is that you)
New single on the way (Okk raw)
Know what I'm talkin bout

[Chorus X 2 - Bloodraw, Young Jeezy]
One thing about me, yeah I got swag
The way I count it up and throw it in my louie bag
Its in my louie bag yeah it's in my louie bag
Its in my louie bag yeah it's in my louie bag

[Verse 1 - Bloodraw]
One thing about Raw, Raw got swag
Raw hit the mall, then Raw pop tags
Raw stay clean, Raw stay french
You know it must be '87, denim jeans (are guess)
I bought 'em in Miami, ship them broads upto Duvall
Must of had 20 chickenheads up in that Uhaul
I move so smooth cause them jackboys backtrack
Half a quarter mill in the brown Louie napsack

[Chorus X 2 - Bloodraw, Young Jeezy]
One thing about me, yeah I got swag
The way I count it up and throw it in my louie bag
Its in my louie bag yeah it's in my louie bag
Its in my louie bag yeah it's in my louie bag

[Verse 2 - Young Jeezy]
Now these aint prada, costs me alotta
Pasta, spaghetti, you can send them we ready
Same color as our watches, call it karate
Make the dubs spin around and roundhouse somebody
Shoes by Louie, sippin on louie
Look I can't even lie I'm a bitch bout Louie
One thing about Young, young swag with it
The only nigga in the drought with a 19 ticket (Lets get it)

[Chorus X 2 - Bloodraw, Young Jeezy]
One thing about me, yeah I got swag
The way I count it up and throw it in my louie bag
Its in my louie bag yeah it's in my louie bag
Its in my louie bag yeah it's in my louie bag
One thing about Young, Young got swag
One thing about Raw, Raw got swag
One thing about me, yeah I got swag
One thing about me, yeah I got swag
Let me see you (Louie) swag, swag, swag, swag
Let me see you (Louie) swag, swag, swag, swag
Let me see you (Louie) swag, swag, swag, swag
Let me see you (Louie) swag, swag, swag, swag
Let me see you (Louie) swag
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie...</pre>
