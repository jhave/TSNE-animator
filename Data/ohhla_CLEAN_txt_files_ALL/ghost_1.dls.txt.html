[Pharoahe Monch]
How many niggaz who will actually kill still rhymin?
How many niggaz who are actually signed still killin? ..
.. and when it comes to killin a mic, they ain't willin
and I'm supposed to be shook?  That's the shit that kills me
Take a bullet for X in the ballroom and then vanish
Extinguish the sun when I drew, play pool with the planets
Triskadekaphobia lyrics, outlandish
My shit straight from the soul, god damnit
It's the one time only, vernacular original
Spectacular miraculous flow, computer digital
I ridicule the pitiful, piss upon the miniscule
Pharoahe Monch, better park that ass like municipal

*****

	You ripped that shit kid, killed it!
	That was dope, that was dope
	He kinda had that yo, he kinda had that
	Nah man, it did not sound like Pharoahe
	Hey, you need to congratulate
	It was the WEED.. it was the trees
	You need to congratulate, knahmsayin?
Ghost weeeeeeeeeeeeeeed!</pre>
