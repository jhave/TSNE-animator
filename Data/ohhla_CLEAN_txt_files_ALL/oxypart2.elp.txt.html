[El-P]
I met her last week, this insane tart
we been swimmin in eachother with the same heart
I mean I think we might be sections of the same part
And we don't seperate at all until the day's dark
And then she floats away
After zonin with me close all day
I don't believe some of the things we say
Using whispers speaking in the simplest of ways
Thinkin in a similar way
I mean, basicly strangers but we livin the day
Together in a serious way
Gettin blazed and escapin a sick play
So high that our faces erase
We go together through the spaces I trace
Man she looked me dead in my grill
With a hand out strapped for one pill
And I prescribed her fill
And we made love to the thought that life's ill
And how it's crazy that through all of this swill
How you can bump into the beautiful while jumpin from sills

(Hello?)  [Yo, what's up man?]
(Sleeping, what's crackin?)
[I wake you up?] (No I'm awake dawg what happen?)
[Still wont pick her phone up man] (The phone is probably dead)
[I'm saying she's probably buggin out] (C'mon I'm going back to bed)
[Why you frontin on me?] (Because you're startin to bug
And by the time I come to get you she'll be back from the club)
[I'm sayin..] (She still smoke?) [Yeah..] (Then they probably eatin
I think you're paranoid dawg, picture Molly cheatin
Y'all got a kid together man y'all live together
And man if she party too much, you don't raise a fist, you let her
You better! C'mon she running with her homegirls
And you knew when you met her she was stunnin in her own world
You think them oxies got her?) [Shit is so real
and in the past month a new number dominate her phone bill]
(Say word?) [I'm bleeding, I'm heated, and I found the key to her hunger
And I'm about to clap this mothaf..] (Aight dawg, gimme the number.)

I met her last month

[Cage]
..Yeah, That's great
Just Hand over the pills dawg you lookin at hate
face to face. If you observe my ways you see I ain't come to pay

[El-P]
Yo hold up man look around you I ain't gettin robbed today

[El-P]
..What Molly?

[Cage]
..That's the real issue
You know she got a man?

[El-P]
Hold up, I don't understand
Me and Molly, we got a thing, we made a lot of plans
Matter of fact, that girl loves me

[Cage]
No man, she's strung out
and her son's home asleep and his daddy's pulling his gun out


[El-P]
Wait, What you saying? You don't know me. Don't push your luck
I treat this chick like wifey, molly really likes me

[Cage]
Look, I don't care about your bleeding heart or who you love
if you eat or starve, she's still sucking you for the drugs
You're just a pawn, I've known her since we were babies

[El-P]
Whatever man, you know the drill, fifty each, pay me</pre>
