Black Walt told me if you wanna bonafide banga
you gotta start with a hard ass kick and a snare (yea)
Add some dope ass music around and a hard MC and you got

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Every night, it seem like we celebrating birthdays (hoooooo!)
Cause rappin on planet Earth pays
Smelling like versa (chaa) or is it Versace?
You got me sloppy from popping this oxys and shots of saki, copy (chaa)
All you ladies in here, I am sharing wood (chaa)
I just, wanna lay between ya and ram square into it (chaa)
Cause, when it come to women, ya man Aarons good
I done been inside-a more woman than planned parent hood (chaa)
I got more bottles, than new born babys, for youporn ladies
I want you drink up till you horn crazy and rape me (chaa)
Till im lazy and achey (chaa), wanna get shady and tape me? (chaa)
Okay baby lets say we tape me inflating your trakey (chaa)
Im just partying I ain't letting the tool spit (chaa)
I ain't tryan have you haters layin below the pool pit (chaa)
40 acres and mule sit, in my garage with a cool kit (chaa)
eat, drink and be merry mang and miss me with all that bullshit(?)
Aint not telling how drunk and how you'll get

[Chorus 2x]
(Hey hey)
We party and bullshit
Booze it with floosies (hey hey)
And that's how we do's it
Not the Biancas we choosing
Everybody lose it, listenin to our music

[Verse 2: Big Ben]
And they like, and they like, yup do that thing you do (I am)
What you mean? baby gurl I need some liquor too
Aye, she need a picture too, Big Ben she want a picture too
Im F-L-Y, so why not? We can flick a few (fuck yea)
Knock the lenses out my frames and start the ruckus (yes)
So when I scream through the scene you kno you niggas finna crush it
Max out on swagga, not your ordinary rapper
But I do my thing extra, like no ordinary madness (Gotya)
Keep that smooth movement so proper
They keep choosin on ya dude cuz I be's all about my dollas
On the baddest bitch swaggin through, its not a big deal
Shit I receive more tongue then a double stacked thizz pill
Its real, what you say you lose the crew and (e)scape with me
No need to slow it down you let them other suckas pace the speed, dig it? (yep)
Fuck it, imma party like a trap star
and probably get my ass thrown out for going that hard
Aye, Aye

[Chorus 2x]
(Hey hey)
We party and bullshit
Booze it with floosies (hey hey)
And that's how we do's it
Not the Biancas we choosing
Everybody lose it, listenin to our music

[Verse 3: Shadow]
Okay... you said 24 right?
Imma tell you keep it here
I go by the name of Shadow

Yo, yo flow miss me, buy vodka, get pissy
Roll with tech n9ne, bear arms and get grizzly (prrrrraaa)
Ever ready, a killer that flows angelic
Story telling and battle rapping who can't sell it?
Should I speed it up? Nah imma keep it strange
My inner voices told my outer voice to be deranged
The devil on my shoulder got a devil on his back
Who told em everytime I see Biancas give her ass a smack
I need a bumps rock, fresh pair of sucka duckaz
Its a party, im bullshittin with moafuckas
Shadow fly, look at bitches with a crooked eye
Battle me? I think your favorite rapper rather die
Who you know could spit a flow this clean?
My notesbooks to 10th grade, I got so many 16's
Please, I got a lot of hard tones, that'll fuck up your view with a view
like Star Jones
Yall clones, my style is the original
Half you wack rappers just opitimize pitiful
But me? Spittin classic is a ritual
I stopped liking rap when the lion got habitual
Im sick of you, the streets turned me to a cetinel
Im so not Common, but I still see the bitch in you
Shit, can't nobody out-rhyme me
So Tech, call Trav right now and tell him sign me

[Chorus 2x]
(Hey hey)
We party and bullshit
Booze it with floosies (hey hey)
And that's how we do's it
Not the Biancas we choosing
Everybody lose it, listenin to our music

Yea... throw ya cups in the air if ya drunk like me, yea
Tech N9ne, Big Ben, Shadow, X-rated vodka and sprite boy</pre>
