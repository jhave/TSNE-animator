Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

One time..
(There's really, nuttin, realer than this, realer than this)
One time
(This is it right here Dunn)
One time, before I go Dunn this is it right here
Right here, this is it right here Dunn
One time, right here one time
Aiyyo, you know how it goes, aiyyo

[Big Noyd]
Aiyyo, aiyyo, I produce threats, tecs
The underworld sweat when I rep for my set
I pull out tecs and let wet, ice drip
froze on my neck, explode when my 2G whip correct
Out of respect, M-O-double-B top shit
But logic, y'all niggaz know y'all can't fuck wit
From past incidents, shootouts, and fist battles
Scuffles through state lines, you can't stop mine
It's a crime to the dumb deaf and blind
Way before your time out of line niggaz walk straight
When I approach my I, rep my Infamous bloodline
Niggaz get your guns it's thug time
Came from no frills to skips, nights that gat clips
A cold cold world to this icy hot shit
(Nigga) Scars, bars, tappin niggaz shit
I'm cuttin 'em, buckin 'em, and fuckin they bitch
You like, "Who that nigga?"  A smooth cat nigga
Walk around with two gats too nigga
Straight like that nigga, smack that nigga
If I don't know him then blast that nigga

[Chorus repeat 2X: Prodigy]
(Aiyyo) The only way to live is the grimy way
The only way to get ahead is the gun way
We don't play, I can't let 'em stop me and shock me
They try it I pulled out and pop three

[Big Noyd]
This one right here Dunn, aiyyo aiyyo
This goin out to my dearest, realest
Coldest most closest holdin me down
Chrome double digit cali-BLAOW, never apart with it
Cock and spark with it
Get down on my knees and cross my heart with it
cause it's real, when I use it to protect my life
Shit was real when he shot a nigga over his wife
Them be the breaks, guns, drugs, (??)
Clown tried to give me pound I threw it down in his face
I get down - in any town, get down in any ghetto
(??) time spit rounds, what the fuck y'all niggaz thinkin?
Yo for the dough we can spit, my style flow sick
For them sixteen bars, I get in you God quick
You don't want none of this, shit I'm hot as a pit
Check the shit I got 'em shook now they ride on my dick
Don't forget I rock for those lovin it, those thuggin it
Holes in they clothes and the less unfortunate

[Chorus]

[Big Noyd]
Aiyyo, aiyyo
Aiyyo y'all niggaz can't stop me, watch me then
Catch me flyin in my Benz, lovin it
The trey-double-zero, thuggin it, I was born to floss shit
but never could afford it
But now I got ones and guns to re-insure it
Reach for my spine, pull out a fuckin nine Tourist'
The road to the riches, what I'm on it
All I need was the ones, and my Dunns
The motherfuckin beats, I'm makin choruses where my name be
Noyd Infa' nasty
Hoe you obsolete, why?  I got demons
That's what that D be, check me when you see me in the streets
Believe I got toast cause we close like uno dos
and floss and of course Q.B. nigga rep
See you ain't hear me yet, Q.B. nigga
Fuck bein affiliate with, I'm official
Die with the initials on my chest
Be damned if I don't rep the hood to the death

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
