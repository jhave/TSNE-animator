For The Maggots

[Violent J]
One for the maggots, pumpkin's light
Everytime his crew gets into a fight
If I somehow get stomped and kicked
I'm coming for your ass with an ice pick, prick

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
One for the maggots, two for the bitch
Three for the brick that smacks your lips
Cuz you's a sneaky creepy ho
So don't fuck around no more, yo

[Violent J]
One for the maggots, weak as pits
Who sell out they boys for a bitch they just met
And then try to come crawling back
Bitch, you can juggle my nutsac, ho

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
One for the maggots, punk, fuck you
Trying to be like everybody that you ever knew
Trying to be somebody that you not
Bitch, that's how ya get shot
And left for the maggots
