[Intro: David Icke's "Was He Right?"]
The greatest form of control
is where you think you're free
when you're being fundamentally manipulated and dictated to
One form of dictatorship is being in a prison cell
and you can see the bars and touch them
The other one is sittin in a prison cell
but you can't see the bars and you think you're free
What the human race is suffering from, is mass hypnosis
We are being, hypnotized, by people like this
Newsreaders, politicians, teachers, lecturers
We are in a country and in a world
that is being run by unbelievably sick people
The chasm between what we're told is going on
and what is really going, on is absolutely enormous

[Chorus: Block McCloud]
It's like we all know what's goin down
But no one's sayin shit what happened to the home of the brave?
These motherfuckers they controllin us now
But no one's talkin about it, made us proud to be slaves
And everybody's just walkin around
Head in the clouds, we won't awake until we're dead in the ground
By then it's too late, we need to be ready to raise up
Welcome to the end of days

[Vinnie Paz]
Everybody is slaves, only some are aware
that the government releasin poison in the air
That's the reason I collect so many guns in my lair
I ain't never caught slippin, never under-prepared
Yeah, they Shaitan army, they display it proudly
George Bush the grandson of Aleister Crowley
They want you to believe the lie that the enemy Saudi
The enemy ain't Saudi, the enemy around me
There's fluoride in the water but nobody know that
It's also a prominent ingredient in Prozac (for real?)
How could any government bestow that
A proud people who believe in political throwback
That's not all that I'm here to present you
I know about the black pope in Solomon's temple (yeah)
About the Vatican assassins and how they will get you
And how they cloned Barack Hussein Obama in a test tube

[Chorus]

[Vinnie Paz]
Whoever built the pyramids had knowledge of electrical power
And you know that that's the information that they suppress and devour
Who you think the motherfuckers that crashed in the tower?
Who you think that made it turn into ash in an hour?
The same ones that invaded Jerome
The ones that never told you about the skeletons on the moon (yeah~!)
The ones that poison all the food you consume
The ones that never told you 'bout the Mount Vesuvius tombs (brrap~!)
The Bird Flu is a lie, the Swine Flu is a lie
Why would that even come as a surprise? (yeah)
The Polio vaccine made you die
It caused cancer and it cost a lot of people they lives
Do y'all know about Bohemian Grove?
How the world leaders sacrifice their children in robes?
Lucifer is God in the public school system
I suggest you open up your ears and you listen

[Chorus]

[Outro: David Icke again]
The greatest hypnotist on the planet Earth
is a oblong box in the corner in the room
It is constantly telling us what to believe is real
If you can persuade people, that what they see with their eyes
is what there is to see, you've got them
Because they'll laugh in the face of an explanation
that portrays the bigger picture of what's happening
And they have</pre>
