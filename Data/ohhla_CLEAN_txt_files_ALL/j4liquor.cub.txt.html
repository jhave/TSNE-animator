[Intro: K-Dee]
Come here, come here
 
"I've been fuckin' help the crew"
 
Get that boy!!
 
[Ice Cube]
Give me that brew, fool
It's a full time jack move
St. Ides Malt Liquor make the back move
And I'll tell any Tom, Dick and Hank
Who bought Eight Ball, you got ganked
With the black mack the copper
Cause the St Crooked I is so proper
With the L-E-N-C-H-M-O-B toss a dope can and a forty
And that's how we'll greet you
Pass you a brew the first time we meet you
You feel dumb cause you didn't know
Ice Cube don't drink that other Bear no more
Drink some and you won't change back
You'll say - "I ain't never drunk a Bear like that"
Off the end of the bottle you'll choke
Short Dog is in the house - "Yo, pass the Coke"
And if you wanna come up
Pull to the store and get out and then run up
Go to the counter with your five
And buy a fourty of the St. Ides
 
[Outro]
Awww yeah
Awww yeah</pre>
