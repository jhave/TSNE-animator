and cant be having no other chips up in my dip with

from the back, cracked him back showed him the real world

(Da Unda Dogg)
Niggaz be always flossing like they getting laid

ripping my walet like ambanizza, from L.A. 2 da bay to around yo way
I stay breaking da skizza, leaving it in her pocket the hataz will knock it
while fucking my nine up bucking my nuts suck on lyrics and duck em'
I got none on it, cuz if I want it then nigga im taking it
by shaking and baking it no mistake it but I be makin' it
