[Brian McKnight]
This is a love, you're just addicted to what's addictive
Yes you are, baby
I made a big mistake and now you say I'm breakin your heart
Well well well
This is a love, you're just addicted to what's addictive
Mmm mmm mmmm
I made a big mistake and now you say I'm breakin your heart
Go on and tell 'em about it J, tell 'em about it J

[Juvenile]
Now when we first met I told you, it was a you thang, and it's a me thang
Whatever's goin on in your life I don't have nuttin to do with that
You go ahead on and do what you do, y'knahmsayin?
And whatever's goin on in my life
I'ma let that happen the way it's been happenin
Don't change what's goin on, y'knahmsayin?
And when we fuck, that ain't got nuttin to do with the rest of the world
You don't call me, I ain't gon' call you
When we hook up, we just hook up, but OH NO
You wan' take it all out of context, and you know what this really is
You know what the situation is, why you doin that?

[Chorus: Brian McKnight w/ ad libs]
This is a love, you're just addicted to what's addictive
I made a big mistake and now you say I'm breakin your heart
This is a love, you're just addicted to what's addictive
I made a big mistake and now you say I'm breakin your heart

[Juvenile]
Now here we go again
You're scratchin up my car, you're bustin up all my windows
You're callin my house, callin my cell phone
I shouldn'ta never gave you my number anyway
But I thought you was my friend!
I thought me and you was bigger than that, y'knahmsayin?
But you done lost all that
You might as well just lose my number and lose conversation from me, y'knahmsayin?
When you see me in public, don't say nuttin to me no mo'
Cause you tryin to wreck my life
And you know I got a lot goin on in my life right now
I got responsibilities, you understand?

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
So what you got my name tattooed on yo' body?
I ain't tell you to go do that!
You watchin MTV and BET, that's what you want
You got a lil' piece of that and you don't know how to act
You goin crazy!
You better get your mind together because you know what this is

[Chorus] - repeat to fade</pre>
