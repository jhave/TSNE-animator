[Verse 1: Suffa]
This is Suffa MC (Suffa MC) 
Hey I could say "lifes not all that it's cracked up to be"
And I feel like a dump trucks sufferin' back on to me
And its smothering me in a wealth of decay
And Im suffering me, and no ones ever felt the way I do
But I believe in something (what you believe?)
I do believe, I believe in life (well I believe)
I do believe that the sun is shining (is shining)
On the other side of the night
And if I believe long enough and my beliefs strong enough
And I believe in my own damn song enough
Then I can believe in myself, believe in faith
Crush my own anger, envy, even hate
Then we can make a new start free from hate
Believe in fate has a positive - even great
Proceeds away from our dreams, we need to make
cos I cant leave it late
We need to take the seeds that take our hearts and see them break
When we await to find ourselves freed by faith
And we can't wait to see the face, see them shake at this
See the hate, see them wait
for me to break
For he or she to break
Suffa MC with they
They need escape - see ya mate, now free the gate
See them run from the path they deviate
While this man elevates and alleviates

"I believe it's OK, I do believe I believe in life
I do believe that the sun is shining on the other side of the night"

[Verse 2: Pressure]
And by the way I do believe in myself
Not believing only things I can see for myself
Even believing that the air that Im breathing is wealth
Because we're guaranteed nothing except leaving this world
Im just trying to live, Im just trying to breath
Im just trying to give so that I can receive
Lifes positive cos universally weve got a lot to give
So when Im taking my leave I believe I should leave my mark
Before our own music is perceived as art
Soulful remedies to ease the heart
When grief is sparked
Beneath the dark skys I search to seek my mark
Friends come and go so I move on as the seasons start
Release the dark side of my mind to find peace at heart
Increase my smarts rather than walk on streets (where) theres mud
Nearly can beat the spark, needless this grief has marred
the whole world - clearly you know who the elitists are
Beliefs more unique, the peace laws are weak
Governments are sworn to speak the truth of born defeats
The pens are mightier than any mans sword that's shit
Argue we flaunt the fists, for war on streets
cause more than grief
Poverty strikes, people are torn beneath
cornered streets walked by people who were born deceased
I rise above this world and cease my defeat
I got faith in myself, contrary to your beliefs
