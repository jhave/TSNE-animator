[Jim Jones]
Now don't push me away, cause when the first time I met you girl you shook me in ways
You know the life of a nigga's cookin' up yay
And because you knew the pitfalls and the tumbles of the game
You've seen the spotlight watch niggas fallin' to the fame
And all the time you tried to tell me to stay hungry and maintain
When I was like lets go half on a baby, and if not then lets go half on a 'cedes
Drop top coup while we pumpin' sweet sadie
Flyin' up Lennox, doin' us, pushin' 80
The late nights, the road trips got you pissed
The road trips, the late nights got us rich
The clothes that we wear, the place that we piss
Run and get shot, we ain't what we sit
So if I don't get a chance to tell you
Now too often girl your hand so helpful
In this cold world girl every man needs help too
So baby Im'a ride and no plans to fail you

[Chorus]
Please, baby don't push me away
I want you (I want your love beside me baby)
(Please) Please, baby don't push me away
Cause I need you (Cause I need you)

[Jim Jones]
I had enough of the shucking and jiving, duckin' and hidin'
I'm tryin' to get to conversation and ridin' (Well)
Cause I'm feelin' your essence your presence
is just enough to let me know that its destined
And since the day that I found you
There's something about you that makes me want to lose it and pounce ya
But it's not just your body, it's your mind
Your spirit, everything combined
And while I got a chance, take my hand and let me show you something real
That love you can feel (Yeah)

[Chorus]

[Jim Jones]
Uh, now two years done passed, few cheers, few laughs
Coppin' Vs, shoppin' sprees gears in the bags
And who cares who's near, cause most of the bitches would just say you was there for the cash
And I ain't scared of your past, I prepare for the future
The one thing I ask is just don't tear a nigga coup up
You brang the bail when I was caged up
And back and forth the court to the lawyer now we case shut
You found the numbers in my phone, you was my face but
You know what they say the break ups to make ups
And I admit I'm getting better with the flirtin'
You know you dead sexy when you yellin' and you cursin'
You such a hell of a person so when I get home I'm gonnna tell you in person
Face to face, Im'a run base to base
And then Im'a slide home safe till I make yo body shake
You tell me every night that life comes with a twist
That I'm in the spotlight and I'm runnin' the risk
Hey you always say love don't come with a kiss
Its hard soakin' up game when its comin' from a bitch
But where's my manners, never take you for granted
Never take you advantage, most people don't understand it
Is you happy? Look inside humor
When you and I together what the fuck they gonna do wit us
Say ya prayer cause we destined for glory
And when the credits roll its Harlem's West Side Story

My vision of the lovin' is close
That's how I want us to be when we doin our thing (Well)
Kissin' ya, lickin' ya, touchin' ya, rubbin' ya, tell me how you want me to bring it
Because I know he got limits but baby I don't, and my feelins they won't
Let you get away from me, come stay with me
Baby, Baby, Pleeaaaassseee

Baby don't push me away (When the sunshine)
When the sunshine turn to rain, baby I can take away your pain
(I can take away your pain)
Just call me up when you need some time, I'll take you out, break you off like
Daddy come on
You don't have to settle for less and baby I can give you what you want
(I can give you what you want)
Just call me up when you need some time, and you can get it from me just like
Daddy come on

Shit, so don't push me away</pre>
