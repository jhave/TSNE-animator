Why they got to hate on me?
(I don't know, I guess they love my swag, love my swag, love my swag)
ha ha who? Mike Jones! Who? Mike Jones! Who? Mike Jones!
(? You a fool with this one)
I got a question:
(why they got to hate on me?) I wonder why
(why they got to hate on me) ay, ay (why they got to hate on me)
I wonder why (why they got to hate on me) ??

VERSE I
I swear to god I came from nothing to something
I ain't get no handouts I got mine from hustling
Hustlin from nothing to something
I had to get it no time to play with it, my money I was committed
And when I got my paper, my paper, I split it
When everybody ?? was down with it
But all of a sudden everybody start hatin (why they hatin)
I don't know, why everybody hatin'
They see me on them 22s givin boys the blues
When they see me shinin they don't have a clue
They be like who is that? I be like Mike Jones!
I'm like Pimp C - I got a +Pocket Full of Stones+
But it ain't work, homie it's my CD's
And I sold about 2 million in the streets
So why they hatin me? Cuz I pull up Jet Li
With the eighty fos and fos on that new Bentley
So I ask:

CHORUS (Tanya Herron)
Why they got to hate on me? Why they got to hate on me
(I wonder why) why they got to hate on me?
(I wonder why I wonder why)
Why they got to hate on me? Why they got to hate on me?
Why they got to hate on me?

VERSE II
I spent a half million in the city baby (how much)
A half billion in the city baby
'97 ? boxster know how much I spent
I swear to god when it come to paper I ain't got no mint
When people needed money they'd holla at me
I swear to god when they needed it they holla'd at me 
Club ice age I put everyone on they feet
Then they turn around and ? damn
I see yall out there hatin on me
But I got the world waitin on me
They waitin on me why are they haiting on me
I ask the lawd but I ain't trippin get inside the booth and press record
I'm a g and these streets said that I ain't got to answer to nobody
Especially the ones with no ? so far ahead that they can't catch up
Why they wastin os on me tryin to set me up?

CHORUS Repeats

VERSE III
Tell me, what have I done to you? What have I done to you
To make you all hate on me ay ay
What have I done to you what have I done to you
To make yall hate on me
They see me shinin in the limelight
They see me shinin by myself and they say that I ain't right
Why is it that I had to grind on my own baby
V12 yeah I'm rollin on that chrome baby
I know he mad cuz he lyin ? my name in your brain
I pull a wide frame I'm about to take your dame
I pull a piece of chain
pinky ring to the turning lane
why they hate on me mane
no need to explain

CHORUS Repeats
