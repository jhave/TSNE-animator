Once upon a time not long ago
When gangsta's sported gats and smoked dope dope
And all the fly tricks say they'd die for me
Cause I was raised in the hood as a little ass G
 
Once upon a time not long ago
When gangsta's sported gats and smoked dope dope
And all the fly tricks say they'd die for me
Cause I was raised in the hood as a little ass G
 
Twos, fours, hoochs and shows
These tricks only trickin with them real g dogs
Toutin' up on all the brothers insizignt 
She never had chippers on me, She chipped in on my cadilliac
I see cat with the bomb you can sniff appreciate
When I get your ass just like a gift, trick sniff, sniff
Hold up your spine
Now you better have my motherfuckin' tip o'nine
Like playin' on meditate so what's this pimp sayin'
I said that thing between your legs gots those tricks playin'
You think I'm some kinda sugar daddy
Next time we'll do it your ass on all the homies having daddies
 
(Snoop chorus)
Now I have touched one million flows
And I have done about a million shows
I'm tryin' to get about a million dollars in gold
While I'm dippin' with the homie Goldie Loc let's roll
 
Chickies these days be bootin' a whole lot
Messin' around get got
Pimpin' and never stop
No hope because she won't trust me
I'm little Goldie D and I'll be out for the money, money, money
 
But when I see something strange, I change the situation
Here's my thang trick, now you know what you're facing
And now that's how I greet'em, I treat'em, like bomb mixes major
Hold them on the hip like a mother fuckin' rager
But it feels real good to be single
When I hit the bomb clubs all it does do is mingle
Pass the hooch to me
Better pass it right back
I'm not gonna lock it down cause it ain't about that
But for a second she gotta see my spoon coon
With me she better be ready for swinging fatter than chrome so zoom
It might be the day that she wakes up
And realize that I got the girl shook up
 
(Snoop chorus)
Now I have fucked one million ho's
And I have done bout a million shows
I gotta bout a million dollars in gold
While I'm dippin' with the homie Goldie Loc lets roll
 
(voiceover)
I hear you little Goldie Loc. Sorry if I'm homie
Let'em know we don't play on the Eastside
But Dogg what's happenin' with these broads talking about bills, bills, bills
Callin us grugs and all that homie
 
(Snoop)
Honey child you need to chizill
I ain't payin' your biznill, on the riznill
Niggers out there from the L.B.C. Northside, Northside up
All the homies from the Westside. Westside up
Ain't no Southside Long Beach niggers
There's only Eastside. Eastside up... Eastsidaz 
This is how we doing it ya'll. Dogghouse
You didn't know. You do now
We outa this biotch. You know the rest
 
(Snoop chorus)
Well, well ya'll push me to the limit now its time to sail
But when the ship sails there won't be no ho's again
But as for right now I like the way you sound
Cause you're putting it down
So all you ho's out as soon as it hits the streets</pre>
