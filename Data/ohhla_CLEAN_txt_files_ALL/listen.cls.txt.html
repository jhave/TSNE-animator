[Intro - Classified - talking]
(Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen)
Class, yeah, yeah, yo

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Now when I speak truth (yeah), I get labeled as a asshole
Say what I see, talk what Class knows
Everybody wanna sit on the plateau
Never grow up, stay young and act out
Never back out, don't make assumptions
Tracks hit and I still spit substance
Yes y'all, straight killin the public
Over the top with next to no budget
Kid's tight but gotta stay focused
Rip mics, ripped off by promoters
Handle my bus' (okay), keep hands clean
I roll with a crew but I'm a one man team (and)
Doesn't matter if you think I'm hot or not
Just keep talkin 'bout me at the Barber Shop
No names drop, that gained you props
Don't be jealous, someday my reign'll stop
But until then I'm still gonna do this (yeah)
Without music, I'm basically useless (what?)
Stand here for another ten years
With a mic in my hand and a beat in my ear

[Chorus]
Now let me make myself clear (okay), been only here for a minute
Need to get this off of my mind, just let me handle my business (yes)
I'm takin it one at a time (ha), I've just begun so man listen
So listen (listen), so listen (listen), so listen (listen), listen 
(listen, listen)

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Never fall off, Class still spit it
Freestyle for hours, end you in minutes (ha)
Talk trash, kid I ain't kiddin
Ain't a funny guy but I leave you in stitches
And I'm a say it, MCs are bitches
Always complain every time we spit shit
Worse than women, gossip and dissin
Damn, I do it too but ain't afraid to admit it (ha)
Feels like the whole World just flipped around
I know kids used to hate, now give me pounds
Same time I know kids used to love me
Made moves, now they can't stop actin ugly
But that's hip-hop, your average fan
Stay underground, be the favorite band
Guess it feels like they found somethin new
But when other people like it, they start hatin you
And that's hip-hop

[Break - Scratched samples]
("Embrace my words, em-em-embrace my words")
("Word, word, word, words, word, word, words")

(Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen) - 2X

[Verse 3 - Classified]
And I know what I done (yeah), media ignores me
I done more than the artist in your story
Go ahead, don't bother to support me (nope)
So much hate in my own territory (haha)
I'll still lay tracks to rest
Live in effect, Class in the flesh (and)
I should teach rap in steps (ha)
Sell it to whack cats on paperback cassettes (yes)
I'll do what I need to survive this
Ain't goin back to the nine to five shift
(Smoke too much weed) and I'm tryin to be the livest
Tryin to make noise but I move in silence, yeah

[Chorus] - 2X

(Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen) - 2X</pre>
