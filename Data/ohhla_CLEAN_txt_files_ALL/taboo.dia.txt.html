Chorus: Diamonique
I don't know why sometimes I feel like
Loving you
And I don't know why sometimes I feel like
Hating you
I don't know why sometimes I feel like
Kissing you
Oh
Why, why, why, cause it's the
Sweetest taboo

[Diamonique]
(Verse 1)
Me and you
Been going through
This shit a long time
Ask God who's been on my mind
Since back when I remember, before November
Maybe September, who knows, but however
Been six months
Since we've last touched
And been six months
Since we've last fucked
Now I don't know how you feel, but what I'm feelin' is real
You got me all fucked up, you make me sick, I feel ill (Yeah, yeah)
From all the things that you say, and all the things that you do
But when it all boils down, though, I still love you (Oooh)
Don't matter what they think
Don't matter what they say (Oooh, oooh)
I'm a feel how I'm a feel regardless, anyway
So I can care less
Of what they think of our mess
And I can care less
Because it's you that I miss (It's you, I'm missin')
I want you in my life
I need you in my life
Taboo so sweet, that you know it ain't right (Oooh)

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
This love got me
Fuckin' up my whole life
I pray every single day (Yeah)
In order to make the shit go right (Yeah)
Tell me what should I do, I'm crying because of you
I've got so much pain and so much love for you
Damned if I do, and damned if I don't (Oooh)
But either way it goes, I tried to give you the most (Oooh, oooh, oooh)
All that I have, and all that I've got
I promise to give it all, I promise to keep a spot (Yeah, yeah)
In my heart, in my soul, I'm a never let you go (Hun, hun)
Cause you're the star in my sky, the apple of my eye (Oooh, oooh)
You bring me happiness, but mostly loneliness
Now you thinkin' what good's gonna come from this (Oooh, oooh)
A love tragedy
Is always sad to see
Are you made at me
Or do you still love me? (Oooh)
Do you still love me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I wanna know
Is this really how love is supposed to be? (I don't know)

Repeat Chorus

Bridge: Diamonique
Oh why
I try
Oh why
I cry
Baby I
I wanna stay with you
But you're no good for me
I don't know what to do
Cause it might be gone, but it feels like love to me

Repeat Chorus

[Diamonique]
I don't know why sometimes I feel like (Yeah)
Loving you
And I don't know why sometimes I feel like
Hating you (I, I)
I don't know why sometimes I feel like
Kissing you
No I don't, no I don't (Oh)
Who knows, but however
This is the sweetest taboo (Just say)
No, no-no-no, no, no-no
No, no-no-no, no, no-no (Street Light)
No, no-no-no, no, no-no
No, no, no, no (Uh)</pre>
