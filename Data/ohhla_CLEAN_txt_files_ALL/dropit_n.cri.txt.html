"Fi-fi-fi-Fingazz on the track..."

Pre-Chorus: Fingazz
I need a little mami
To call me papi
Need a girl that's freaky
Enough to rock me

Chorus: Fingazz
Let me see you drop it, mami
Show me how you rock it, mami
Hop it like a six-three Chevy
That's how you rock it, mami

Hook:
Let me see you drop it and rock it
Let me see you drop it and rock it
Let me see you drop it and rock it
Let me see you drop it and rock
Rock-rock-rock, rock it

[Verse 1: Mr. Criminal {Mr. Criminal slowed down}]
First off, girl, let me see you bounce with it
Like a six-three, drop and hit the ground with it
Let me see you, girl, drop it, don't stop it
Tonight, I need a freak, so that is the topic
It's Criminal with Joey Crack, I know you see that
We got the heat that's guaranteed to make you Lean Back
I Make It Rain on 'em
L.A. to New York
Hi Power, Terror Squad, droppin' game on 'em
It's gettin' hot
The club is gettin' packed now
Enough alcohol for everyone to act loud
Let me see you, girl, get it, don't stop
Pop it like a glock, baby, {drop it like it's hot}
Look, baby, watch me start this trend
I got a little dance for you, girl, you and your friend
I need a freak
Like everyday of the week
You wanna know, how to do it, listen now to the beat

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook

[Verse 2: Fat Joe (Fingazz)]
Damn girl, with that [{*ass*}] so fat (So fat)
Make it bounce like an acrobat
From the window, to the wall
She made it drop like a mean six-four
And your boy's sick, brah
L.A., where they takin' the wall
She loves me
I figure
She said, "Joe Crack's that [{*nigga*}]"
Backshots to make her hit high notes
Cubano
Mexicano
And this how the story goes
And you know, Joe Crack don't love these (OH!)

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook

[Verse 3: Mr. Criminal {Mr. Criminal slowed down}]
So tell me, baby girl
What you think
Like T-Pain, can I Buy U A Drank
Need a little lady, little somethin' like a freak
Drop it on the dancefloor, drop it as we speak
I heard a phone when I knew it wasn't my phone
And so, she made her body move like a Cyclone
All in my zone
She made it drop
Showin' everybody how she could make it rock
So I'm backin' up
To let the little freak
Do her thang, watchin' everybody watch her back it up
And now with Fi-fi-Fingazz on the track
All the ladies on the dancefloor, {baby, bring it back}

Bridge: Fingazz
When you shake, shake, shake it like that
Make me, wanna break, break, break a whole stack
And rain on ya
I can Make It Rain if you can rock it

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook
