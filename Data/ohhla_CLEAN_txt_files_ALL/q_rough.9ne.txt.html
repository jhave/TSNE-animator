Song:   Questions (Rough Draft)
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

The name of this motherfucker is called Questions (ha)
Rough Draft (ha ha, tell em)
QDIII did the beat (all day all night)
Whassup to everybody out there in L.A.

What's really goin on?
Why do I do the things I do?
Why so many questions?
What am I doing?
I talk to myself... when there's no-one to talk to

I wanna ask me a question
When am I gonna make it up out of a hellish and devilish way?
When are you gonna make mill-ions with the dividends;
when are you gonna make ends generate wait?
Who in the hell, left the gate open? Do you wanna sell?
Is everybody on wavelength like us?
Why do I rip it in half, doobie kick ass with backwards
Attach isssh like hap ut eallavik?
Can you wait a minute? Can you slow it up a little bit
Nina so I can get up in it?
But did you really wanna dabble in fanatical supernatural
Lyrically-radical milli minutes, I'm about to begin it
Can I get some, can I spit some, which one?
When am I gonna get off this trip?
Can I take another pill, why do I feel
Like I'm a sick individual in the room, poppin off at the lip?
Do you, feel me? Do you do voodoo really?
Did you get it? Did you want a real epidemic?
Will you let me run up in it?
What's the word; is it absurd? What is that is you hurt?
Was it real, is it real, was it really real?
Tech9ne in it to win it besides QDThird occurred
Who's the worst, who's rastafari?
You never livin never sure it's Selassie I the First
Brother on the planet Earth, who? Do you wanna flow;
What you wanna do?
How can I be in the zone like this, gone like this?
How can I break the obsession?
In the middle of it all, when I snap back, step back
And ask myself; what, why do you ask so many questions?

Why?
Do I wanna stick em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill em in this
Why?
Do I wanna stick em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill em in this

Do you understand? whatcha gonna do when Nina hit you
With the critical homidical lyrical killer flippin
Leavin you with boo-boo underpants?
How does it feel? Do you wanna come up and chill with an assassin?
Can you feel it inside, what?
The feeling of a commotion of two titans clashing
Why me, who are you, what I am supposed to do - what a nigga here fo'?
Who do you fear mo'? Is it the Nine, with a brand new joint?
Like to hear it, here go
What are you lookin at, when am I gonna get a dose of thorazine?
Can you give me a little something to ease the pain?
Ease the man, who's the man?
Tech-a-Nina with the Road Dawgs and the Midwest Side Crew's to blame
Can I get a little back with attack issh?
What do you accomplish, ever can't you diss, diss
Pitless bottom of aye, and you toss out nigga ass, bade mish
Hate a playa percenter a-hundred that is
Side West, Mid, down ever who off, what?
Hack it, did you know Tech9ne hot like a dragon?
Did you feel it baby? Can you give me a double dose
Of whatever the feeling I'm gettin is really pain
It's Kobain, for anybody want a piece of this, sickness
Is it a cinch to get with hot?
Who, when, where what why?
I'm at the pinnacle with a killer eye, do I wanna
Die no I just wanna dose of the most inner syringe
Up in my thigh, bonzai!!

Why?
Do I wanna stick em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill em in this
Why?
Do I wanna stick em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill em in this
Why?
Do I wanna stick em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill em in this
Why?
Do I wanna stick em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill em in this

Now do you know what the real is?
Does everybody think I'm twisted? Non-realistic
Or do you think that I'm gifted, I'ma lifted
Can you help me? Am I lookin at you
Can I be peepin you from afar, please, remain calm
Could you be the reason I'm a bomb
Straight out of Vietnam, ready to explode on Sa-tan?
Tell me what the problem is, I'm a'ight what the bottom is
Do you know what a empty column is?
Am I your worst nightmare? I feel sick right there
Should I blow it out, can I do without, do I need help?
Am I living within a pen of demons?
I'm stressing, can I get a blessing (from who?)
The one who cursed me with all these questions

Why?
Do I wanna stick em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill em in this
Why?
Do I wanna stick em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill em in this
Why?
Do I wanna stick em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill em in this
Why?
Do I wanna stick em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill em in this

Hey man uh, I can't man I gotta I gotta I gotta
