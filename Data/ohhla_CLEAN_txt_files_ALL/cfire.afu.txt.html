[Lil Fame] hey hey hey hey hey
[Afu-Ra] I don't want to be a rap dude no more
[Billy Danze] Nigga!

[Lil Fame]
Yo come back with that shit pause your argue lent
G's bang it out homeboy fuck the argument
Still on top of my game holding the fork
But the situation got me inpatient start blowing your torch
The fizzy move, the fizzy move
At fizzy (home) four O, no doubt
Cus I am a BK villain
And this year I 'm passing out brass knuckle ass wiping
Ten years in this bitch, fuck it, Switch speeds
I been spitting this venom since the age of fifteen
But you wanna be the Jordan of rap
An I' be catch you on the rebound slam dunk two in your back
You aint shit, never was shit, never gone be shit
I'm the cold Medina DP shit, AH (AH)
Authentic true blue believe it ill be back for the 2 o's 2

[Chorus 1]
(Scratching) Bone crushing, bone breaking
Now what you rock for
We in the making you move like is a dead zone
Steady.(Scratching) causing damage.
Now what you stop for
We hit you off for the brain that what we came for

[Afu-Ra]
You see I' m faster than you faster than anybody
Fast like a hottie doing a buck sixty on the Bacadi
You couldn't spare my rage F the Porsche-a
You know I squash ya'
Daddy yo I'm hotter than Chinese chilly sauce mixed with musavie
I'm sick in the head invisible fleds
I'm shooting the stars I'm blacking the whites to blues
That right yeah
I'm sickening with the kung fu
More complex then mixo flicks or were I yank a bitch
Supposing a remix stick with some sick shit
Pistachio absolute Tanqueray mix with tequila
I'm instillina a willina and killing ya' (killing ya')
Mother sucking fire breathing Godzilla
Ayo this party right here is straight fire, (FIYAHH)
Life Force, M.O.P we take it higher
(Scratching) Bone (Scratching) crushing
(Scratching) Bone (Scratching) breaking

[Chorus 2]
(Scratching) Bone crushing, bone breaking
Now who do you rock for
We in the making you moves that's why came for
Steady.(Scratching) causing damage.
Now what you stop for
We stimulating the brain thats why we came for

(Scratching) Bone crushing, bone breaking
Now what you rock for
We in the making you move like is a dead zone
Steady.(Scratching) causing damage.
Now what you stop for
We hit you off for the brain that what we came for

[Billy Danze]
Let's pop it off (yes sir who that is?)
William Danze one of the illest ever
That spit sparks with from both hands
I learn these criminal ways
Were criminals blaze at everything above waistline
You take mine you aint that bad you must be mad
You fucking faggot got mixed up with another dude
May peace and blessings be upon you
How you doing brother do, No
Look if I was in a position of giving us faith (Listen)
Osama Bin Laden would have been shot in his face (Missing)
Like every life he destroy in the World Trade
I aint got no patients for the faggot less great
Couldn't wait to hit the wake, with an O.G staff
Trained to shake'em, take'em and break'em in half
Using heavy caliber weapons for clearing the path
The same as we do in the ave nigga
Look (Look) is the legendary M.O.Piggidy back
Murdering tracks with Afu-Rigidy black

(Sratching)
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
(repeat twice)</pre>
