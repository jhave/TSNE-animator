Let's Make a Deal, pickle I'm pitchin penny dimes and nickles
You couldn't sell a sticker, on the tape your DJ tickles
I jiggle and juggle the rhymes like, I was to keep you suckers all waiting
My tub I rub-a-dub it with my rubber duck I play
with those quack MC's, someone's been sittin in my chair
And I'ma wash that crank right outta my hair
Shampoo but, I'm down with the Nubian Nut, Joe and go for self
You're buggin buddy doin somebody nosin don't know yourself
Peace to Sef and Jeff, Tae ?Deesy Dirty and Don Tanean?
Haste makes waste, so with the case is how my day begins
Hot in quarter vader shops the sports day market pelo
I'm think of my pap, the doctor slapped me in the hostpial with a G-O
Word is bond when I was born, and I took a breath
I never rhyme with busted rhymes and even the blind knew I was def
Respect to Chico ?Waller Al Kadee Roscoe Kalidjusome?
Poo-da, Ba Ba, Luther, the Baby B-Boyz always into some
Time for get me drunk, ?Stu and more my cousin adulay?
Fuck the bitches who dissed us and the hoes who wouldn't give Rash' a play
I'ma play, and which way, until I get my new props
Peace to Ricki Love the rockin shot to all the beer spots
The marks we used to stick up, the posse gets much thicker
To those who I forgot yo I'ma blame it on the liquor
That's my nigga list, to those who I missed
my ass you can kiss I gotta piss</pre>
