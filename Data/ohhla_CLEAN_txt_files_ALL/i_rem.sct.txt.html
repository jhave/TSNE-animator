Song:   I Remember
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
And I remember
The kind of full we had
Caught up in this situation
We getting high, I know that
And I remember
The kind of pain I felt
Sleepin free to a bed
I knew my mama needed some help
But I remember

[Verse 1]
My mama find I beat it pimpin 5 cases
Remember when I was locked down bad with no paper
Gambling with them OG nigga as a youngin
Grew up in a hustling family, I had no choice but to get some money
I'm askin bout my hustle nigga as a early team
'Cus I remember getting tricked by the dope fiends
When I jumped off the porch I used to give away the dope
I'm flexin mink coats now, I remember when it started coke
I got airplanes, now I fly to you with this dope
I got all kind of prices, 10 different types of coke
I ain't never had no license but I'm always on the go
And motherfuck my daddy cus he still smoking dope

[Chorus]
And I remember
The kind of full we had
Caught up in this situation
We getting high, I know that
And I remember
The kind of pain I felt
Sleepin free to a bed
I knew my mama needed some help
But I remember

The kind of shoes I had
I don't want the soul out
More all I want and I did
But I remember
It ain't no going back
'Cus I done ran the check up
So you can talk about that

[Verse 2]
Thuggin in apartments, sleepin with the roaches
This ain't a freeze watch, this a Rolex fully loaded
Get yo ass off that block
If ain't a 36, we on that
Doin 36 a hour, nigga I'm dope boy Patron
I gave you a brick a month ago
My nigga and you ain't still sell that
Used to dream I have a Rari, look at me now I'm a owner
Cold jail cells, I remember that
No bon fair, where the bible at?
Too much flexin, should've saved it
Ben Franklins had no racks
You a trap nigga, you better work that
I've been broke before and I ain't goin back

[Chorus]
And I remember
The kind of full we had
Caught up in this situation
We getting high, I know that
And I remember
The kind of pain I felt
Sleepin free to a bed
I knew my mama needed some help
But I remember

The kind of shoes I had
I don't want the soul out
More all I want and I did
But I remember
It ain't no going back
'Cus I done ran the check up
So you can talk about that</pre>
