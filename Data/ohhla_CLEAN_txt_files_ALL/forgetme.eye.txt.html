[Eyedea]
Would you believe there's only four more people in the world
And when you're not looking they change masks
Somewhere over the rainbow it's the same
Instead of needle infested train tracks
No matter how fast you run from the eye you hate
There is no escape (There is no escape)
So I wait for the heaven that I seek
Which makes everything insignificant differences
Innocence intendance the vision amongst religion
Visioning innovative criticisms are the state of mind we're living
Time is ticking
If you listen to the sign that wisdom efficiantly spreads
Sing a song that officially deadens the mission
They cling on the friction
I stand stiff in this position
Plans shift
Cause to me your man is in an issue of your ego tissue
Explicit to the point of non-existance
And life in the past is your only interest
I used to build forts in the backyard to hide from the daytime
Missing all the beauty of the sunshine
It's my fault
But I blame the world to a small degree
I've never seen the sky cause I been too scared it would fall on me
So what? You're mad cause I don't want to talk?
But you'd be even more pissed off if I told you what i really thought
So just walk away (just walk away)
You're better off never caring what I say (never caring what I say)

[Chorus][Eyedea]
I been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces
I don't miss none of them and they don't miss me
Fell in love with sensation
Now I'm high on mental piation
But that's the price you pay if you want to live free
Kill my dedication
Put me on your medication
Drop me off in space and never come to get me
Nothing that I say has ever been that amazing
So when I die do me a favor and forget me (forget me.. x7)

[Slug]
Well
Something in the air make me not want to care
Let 'em stare untill I'm riding on an empty spare
Follow the vein straight
As it drapes across the landscape and the sand and the lake
Off the beaten path
Learn the secret math
Keeping the laugh, smug
Too deep in the back of luck
Happy as fuck
But nobody's convinced
Play daddy to the love and try to drop a couple hints
Ever since I came to learn all the right turns
I was cursed with the cigarette burns and the lost words
Found inspiration inside your misery
Always trying to take an inch
More than what they're giving me
Dear God
Let me die on the rich people's lawns
Because I'm not so sure they're gonna learn my songs
Every morning he repeats that same shit
Spends the day trying to be famous
Well another day, shot
And I'm thinking this aquarium is deeper than the last one
My castle was never made of sand
It's one big aluminum can
The chateau of the damned
The shadow of the man you pretend you are
Had a rough thought that got caught and went too far
If I did have a car I'd go broke from the gas
On the shoulder of the road
As you roll past

[Chorus][Eyedea]
I been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces
I don't miss none of them and they don't miss me
Fell in love with sensation
Now I'm high on mental piation
But that's the price you pay if you want to live free
Kill my dedication
Put me on your medication
Drop me off in space and never come to get me
Nothing that I say has ever been that amazing
So when I die do me a favor and forget me (forget me.. x7)</pre>
