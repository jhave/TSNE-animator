Holding down the fort while we keep shit tight
Hit you with that bang shit that keep you live all night
Makin moves strong while we keep rockin on
Now the object is survival son so get your hustle on
Bust two shots while I blow up the spot
I make it hot, till the jam is packed, to the parking lot, now
Me and my mans feel like we astronauts
Cause we so high from off that weed we got from new knots
Certified stimulation got me open wide
Before we slide to side we grab the stash out the ride
We on fire tonight, and the place is lookin steamy
