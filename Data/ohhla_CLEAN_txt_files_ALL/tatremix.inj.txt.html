[Thrill]
Dat right, pull it up one time
We gettin' ready to get this main pumped (ha ha)
INOJ and 69
Bite up, bite, bite up, bite
That pulla joint, huh
See, it ain't no thang, you feel me shorty?
I know you be going through it what not with your man
Boo, you need somebody, holla at me
You got my number, just call me
I'll be there time after time
Feel me?  Sure!

[INOJ]
I'm lying in my bed, hear the clock tickin'
I think of you (uh huh, uh huh)
Caught up in circles, confussion, there's nothing new
Flashback, warm nights, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories, time after
Sometimes you'll picture me
I'm walking too far ahead (miss you all the time)
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you say (c'mon now)
And you say, go slow, I fall behind (you like that)
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after time
(repeat)

[Thrill]
See, me and you
We's was meant to be
Feel me?
So, it ain't now sense of you cryin'
Cuz I'm here to ease your pain
You feel me?
Country boy style

So you say you want a man, nigga, represent
You ain't gotta bring a guide, I know what you meant
Girl, you sick of these cats comin' atcha with the same ol'
Game mis-played out like a cango, hang around your arm like a banjo
Wreckin' the game straight up, spittin' the game
You wanna change but you don't know what to DO
You sick of waitin' for the right one to come THROUGH
Don't sweat it cuz cuz you come to the right place
Cuz I be hittin' like gin with a slight taste
Tight bass in the back with an inch mode
Dijuon to complete the mission
Anytime you need me just call me and I'll be right there to get witcha
Cuz I'm yours and you mine
Together forever, time after time

[INOJ]
After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray (check it out now (uh huh, uh huh))
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secret stolen, all from deep inside
The 808's on time

[Chorus]

[Thrill]
See it's me and you
It's us against the world (that's right)
INOJ and 69 (that's right)
Together forevea (time after time)
Time after time

You might not knew all that we do
69 and 50 crew and yeah we come through
If you need me, baby girl, hit me up
It don't take too much to get me up (that right, that right)
Just beep me up in your loose Impala
Or I'll scoop in the black Impala
And ride while I lend you my ear
Whenever you speak and I wanna hear
Tears?  Go ahead and cry 'em out
See, taht's what this thing called love's about
Sometimes you up, sometimes you down
Sometimes you smile, sometimes you frown
Sometimes you don't know WHERE to go
But baby girl, that's what I'm here for (that's right)
And you man ain't gotta know
Cuz I keep it on the low low

[INOJ]
And you say, go slow (check it out now)
I fall behind
The 808's on time
[Chorus]

[Thrill] + (INOJ)
INOJ and 69 (time after time)
Bite up, bite, bite up, bite, that pulla joint (time after time)
Bring it on, bring it on, remix baby (time after time)
That right, that right (time after time)
Pull it up, pull it up, let's ride (time after time)
To the break of day (time after time)
Take it out, I gotta say (time after time)
69 in da house and we represent (time after time)
Ughh, y'all know what I mean (time after time)
One time wit a girl, INOJ
69 Boyz, y'all we don't play
Bite up, bite, dat pump
Dat pump name and Lil Jon</pre>
