Satisfaction guaranteed
Uhh, I got it good (Neo)

I put product in the street
It sell quicker than weed
I spit it raw like I'm flipping a key
I got what ya'll need (I got what ya'll need)
I got pure for the fiends
Give you more than a freeze
Through your blood stream quicker than D
I got what ya'll need (Satisfaction guaranteed)
(I got what ya'll need)
It's what niggas waiting for (Satisfaction guaranteed)

I put the whole world in a dope fiend
It's still leaning
How many years away from the game
They still fiending
My hustle and flow sound like C-notes
Smoke like a pound hit the town like kilos
I bag it up and get it cracking in clubs
Go on tours like I'm trafficking drugs
(I got what ya'll need)
Who want musical narcotics that all got it
Bomb product, it's all profit when ya'll cop it
Any hood or any city I'm pumping in
Any slum I'm in my customers come again
Spit flow by the boat load like I'm Colombian
My shipments go out to bring the money in
Like supplies that fly to Peru to buy bricks
Go out my way so biters can't do what I spit
Like Freddy told priest in that superfly flick
Player you always got some superfly shhhhh

I put product in the street
It sell quicker than weed
I spit it raw like I'm flipping a key
I got what ya'll need (Satisfaction guaranteed)
(I got what ya'll need) (Satisfaction guaranteed)
I got pure for the fiends
Give you more than a freeze
Through your blood stream quicker than D
I got what ya'll need (Satisfaction guaranteed)
(I got what ya'll need) (Satisfaction guaranteed)

It ain't a city I ain't moving weight in
The world wonder my product got 'em hallucinating
Drop the heaviest rhymes known 'til every minds blown
Keep it popping until I'm clocking in every time zone
Uhh, time is money my grind is hungry
It's for my dudes and my dime honeys (I got what ya'll need)
Dames run up and ask where I've been
Nothing get 'em high as a bag of Rakim
I'm rare like Canadian kush with an opium touch
A fat piece of hash ? and dust
I've got it so good, I got the whole hood smoking it
Coke cookers kill for the flow to cook coke in it
The new form of crack turn fans to fanatics
Hip hop heads to addicts fiends hit off that
DJ's cut it let the streets step on that
Still a 100 percent pure King Heroin's back

I put product in the street
It sell quicker than weed
I spit it raw like I'm flipping a key
I got what ya'll need (Satisfaction guaranteed)
(I got what ya'll need) (Satisfaction guaranteed)
I got pure for the fiends
Give you more than a freeze
Through your blood stream quicker than D
I got what ya'll need (Satisfaction guaranteed)
(I got what ya'll need) (Satisfaction guaranteed)

I got about a million mami's that call me the X love
Cause I kept 'em X'd up, and f'd up like sex drugs
They never come down futuristic high
I leave 'em spaced out so they can kiss the sky
It's like Buda, mami's say man is he's blessed
It's ? in the flesh (I got what ya'll need)
They won't relapse go indeed he's back
My rap flow natural aphrodisiac
I'm a key to a user, piano to a dealer
Liquor to alcoholics and smokers I'm ?
The gospel for the ghettos to skip the gossip
Is he Moses of drugs? either way it's a prophet
Call me a drug loss spit commandments you hooked
It's the kingpin everyday I get booked
Playing my surveillance tapes I'm hot on the streets
Even cops on the beat get caught copping the heat

I put product in the street
It sell quicker than weed
I spit it raw like I'm flipping a key (I know what you need)
I got what ya'll need (Satisfaction guaranteed)
(I got what ya'll need)(been waiting for this) (Satisfaction guaranteed)
I got pure for the fiends
Give you more than a freeze (who cool as this right here man?)
Through your blood stream quicker than D
I got what ya'll need (Satisfaction guaranteed)
(I got what ya'll need) (Satisfaction guaranteed)
