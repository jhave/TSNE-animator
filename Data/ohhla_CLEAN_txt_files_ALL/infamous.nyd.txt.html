The Infamous Mobb 
Big Noyd on his job


Yo son you know what the deal is yeah, spark the lye. Do my thing kid. Yo
Big Noyd in the house for the motherfuckin' 380.

Havoc:
Rappin' Noyd takin' the world over
Universal the Mobb soldiers we explode like super nova
And implode your whole sculpture 
We make quota and cook up some big boulder
We gettin' older time flies we gettin' older
You play the sofa while we excel over the sky rocket
You flee we gonna drop it 
Now reminise over that time you felt some hot shit
We cash profit or for cracks we rock chop it and shot pop it
Desperate attempts to try to stop it
And you be callin' it quits or rappin' Noyd kick that locked up shit

Big Noyd:
I peep wild bucks comin' to jail switch they sex up
It's fucked up niggas get banked up others hang up
The thugs in population be reppin' steppin' for the phone piece
You ass you get splashed in the dome piece
Can't hold your own either
Pack up or get jacked up that's why I strap up with my back up 
Against the wall when it's time to brawl
I'm throwin' blows at devils like Prodigy 
Livin' underneath the roof with 50 thieves
And the ? is bound to get cha
Latin Kings wearin' greens runnin' teef from the island of the Sing Sing
Representin' Queens to the fullest I hold my own watchin' my dome
While I jones for they home they call me a klepto 
Cause I be leavin' niggas wet though
Dead and stinkin' constantly fully blown leakin'
I'm black half Puerto Rican hypothetically speakin'
Monocones gettin' blown sleepin'
I stay strappin' never yappin' that it can't happen
But when you bring it come prepared never scarred captain 
Don't never sain knuckle down spit our bangers do our thing 
Till one of us be bleedin' then be headed to the bing
I'm not bionic I'm just a convict puffin' chronic
Protectin' my way nigga dig it's irronic
Enought to make you bust make you wanna cuss
Nigga what the fuck you ain't tough shit ain't sweet shit is serious
You must be delerious you kidding me talking bout you gettin' me and
rippin' me 
Rather grab a mo and rip it slow like a penetentary 
Nigga please I been in and out the joint since '93 what 
So what the fuck you think you tellin' me nigga what what what
