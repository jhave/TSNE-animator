Jedi Mind Tricks, M.F.C.

[Sean Price]
Yeah first of all don't make me burst and brawl
Image is nothin you frontin see the thirst in ya'll
Think its fucked up now it get worst for ya'll
Assassinate your best friend now I hurt you par
Run up on your block wit dough and I curse you all
The fuck out you wanna wet duke squirt your four
Since birth I been raw hot like surface core
Kidnap your baby's mom straight earth the whore
See I do rhyme and crime so I can purchase more
If you ain't in it for that what the purpose for
Act like you don't give a fuck though
Good so I buck fo' shots from the roof
and my man Rock catch you up close
Never give a fuck about niggas ya'll not Nutso
Hype off of carbonated water then some fructose
Straight buck foes when the nigga Ruck pull the snub nose
Wait Ruck chill, what the deal its all love though
Look into my eyes and you can see there's something changed
Runnin gunnin things knockin niggas out like Clubber Lang
With the gun I bring its straight for beatin you down
Heatin you down leavin you six feet deep in the ground

[Vinnie Paz]
It's some real motherfuckers goin rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash gettin got tonight
Or somebody in the club gettin shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight 

[Jus Allah]
I'm the motherfucking ungrateful
My heart is hateful, my tounge ripped
Lickin on the blade that slayed you
You faggots act as bitch as Rupaul
Ya niggas share one milkshake wit two straws
Scrap wit no doors, four walls tighten
Seein the roof fall, feelin the floors heighten
Crushed and shit your bones and blood siphon
And put it to the jug we sip before fightin
I'm raw lightning my power extends
In the planet and out through the opposite ends
Black man travel through the universe and back
While cavemen still though that the earth was flat
But we kept the sacred plans, now we carry
Throughout the ancient lands
Before the separating of the sands
Of course all the power I create in my hand
He bear my G strength in replicating in man

[Chorus: Vinnie Paz]
It's some real motherfuckers goin rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash gettin got tonight
Or somebody in the club gettin shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm tasteless, there's beauty in strange places
I find beauty in strange places, I find beauty in razors
I find beauty in blood drippin from ya faces
I find beauty in the Qua'ron and all of its Aramaic equations
I find beauty in twelve gauges
I find beauty in teaching you what the definition of pain is
I find beauty stainless steel,
that can kill and reveal the front of your grill
Your brainless, ya'll don't wanna test Vinnie Paz patience
I crack jaws and swing swords of the ancients
Ya'll pretended to understand the matrix
Without attempting to overstand its basics
We dedicated to cats that's been thuggin
Vinnie Paz got more hoes then Jim Duggan
Ya'll been duckin for quite some time now
Vinnie bout to teach you how to write some rhymes now
We aim beams in between your eye brows
Jedi Mind, Sean P combine now

[Chorus]
