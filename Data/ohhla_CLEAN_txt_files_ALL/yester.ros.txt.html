We bout to hit em like this
DOGG POUND!!

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
Let em know that your fucking tonight
Let em now that you wont be hittin em raw I be hittin em (yah yah)
Aint no mystery I do shit right
got this bitch coming back for more (coming back for more)
All the ladies want my single ball out my nigga
Nate is steppin through the door (through the door)
Women remember when I freak them off the first night
you supposed to treat her like she a whore

Chorus: Nate Dogg

Yesterday in the LBC
A sexy stray tried to detour me
She said "Pardon me"
But could you be
The sexy piece that I'm gonna freak

[Verse Two: Nate Dogg]
Let em now that you wont be hittin her raw
let em now that your not gonna make her due (make her due)
Anything that I ask her too
watch her baby stick to me like glue (stick to me like glue)
And she aint sucking dicks ain't nothing funny
not a damn thing new (ain't a damn thing new)
We all the ladies I see on my flights
I can lay some pussy bout one or two (too one or two)
I just heard theres a party tonight
maybe me and my boys can slide through (me and my boys can slide through)
I think its time for me to get away I think I need me another boo

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Yesterday in West L.A
A sexy thing strayed on way
She tried to take me by the hair
She tried to make me her lover pair

[Verse Three: Nate Dogg]
Let em know you wont be shakin the spot
let her know she should be chasing her dreams (chasing her dreams)
Its been a minute you should know me by now
once I get I get up and I leave (I get up and I leave)
Ain't no need for no kissing tonight
you can kiss it but don't kiss me (don't kiss me)
Later on you'll be grippin it tight
just imagine you be grippin on me (you be grippin on me)
I ain't frontin ain't no hit me tonight
I hope you ain't that hard to please (ain't that hard to please)
I can give your body what it wants
as long as you can give me what I need

[Verse Four: Roscoe]
I really don't care about your hair
I like that birthday suit you wear
I think we make a sexy pair
My two-way loaded up with emails from gullable females
Tryin to get to know the Pound
The fuckin Pound
We are the best through it
Usually when the chick throws it out she catch to it
Nate Dogg break em off with a lil game
For they lil brain
A lil piece of knowledge of the instrumental piece
Show em how
We blow em out
We bomb singles
Make all the single women bounce
We all on the same page wid it
Same way wid it
Tryin to see the game change wid it
Baby let your braids hang wid it
Switch lanes wid it
Spit flame, get dames, get brains wid it
Its Roscoe making them all take notes
To Roscoe leaves your place toast
You better get a glass of cold something
Cuz Im coming with the heat
Watch mothafuckas drop like cops
We G'D UP!!

[Verse Five: Nate Dogg]
Let em know that your fucking tonight
Let em now that you wont be hittin em raw I be hittin em (yah yah)
Aint no mystery I do shit right
got this bitch coming back for more (coming back for more)
All the ladies want my single ball out
my nigga Nate is steppin through the door (through the door)
Women remember when I freak them off the first night
you supposed to treat her like she a whore

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Yesterday in the LBC
A sexy stray tried to detour me
She said "Pardon me"
But could you be
The sexy piece that I'm gonna freak

[Verse Six: Nate Dogg]
Let em now that you wont be hittin her raw
let em now that your not gonna make her due (make her due)
Anything that I ask her too
watch her baby stick to me like glue (stick to me like glue)
And she aint sucking dicks ain't nothing funny
not a damn thing new (ain't a damn thing new)
We all the ladies I see on my flights
I can lay some pussy bout one or two

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Yesterday in West L.A
A sexy thing strayed on way
She tried to take me by the hair
She tried to make me her lover pair
