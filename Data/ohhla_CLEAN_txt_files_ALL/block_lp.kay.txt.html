[Intro: DJ Kay Slay]
DJ Kay Slay The Drama King!!!! 
In the hood where I come from, we didn't give a damn about no rockstars!!!
It's about being a blockstar!!!

[Chorus: Ray J] (Yo Gotti)
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!! (Wife beater we just thuggin homey)
(What it do Slay! Yeah!)

[Verse One: Yo Gotti]
Where I'm from they don't even play the radio
Real street nigga let me give ya a scenario
Cocaine dream kush thoughts are superial
Baking Soda box no milk dry cerial
Good life, bad days homey I'm a blockstar
Money, sex and drugs I live like a rockstar
Baking Soda Gotti, my life in a glass jar
Favorite color white so I went and bought a white car
White watch, black shades, I need a 5 star
If she do the right thing I fuck around and wife her
I'm Straight Stuntin from North Memphis to N.Y.
I'm like the wind homey (Homey) I help the birds fly

[Chorus: Ray J] (Jim Jones)
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
(We hustle for that money, check this out though)

[Verse Two: Jim Jones]
Where I'm from we was taught to blow the cash
We was pullin out knots of money when the photos flashed (Cheese)
Gamblin then re-up on our cars we blow our last
Had a Panoramic Roof screen fallen on the glass (Thunder)
Baby mama screamin how long will it last?! (Fuck her!)
Need to slow down cause I'm goin too fast (Slow.......down)
Too fast summertime doin wheelies (Uh)
Blowin on that Color Purple like my name was Celie (Hey)
Silly, all we did man was hustle for it (Hustle for it)
Stay fly pray to God we not cuffed up for it (Thank You God!)
My man facin time tryin to cop up
I keep thinkin about all the cars that he had hopped out (Jones!)

[Chorus: Ray J] (Busta Rhymes)
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
(You already know Busta Bus got 'em!!!!)

[Verse Three: Busta Rhymes]
While you all busy tryna be Metallica, nigga
I'm in the hood whippin the Battlestar Galactica, nigga!
Smolov the {?} wild lookin shit with insane shine
A spaceship, strange and beautiful at the same time
Breakin them corners while I do the dip up on the cop car
The hood love whenever I pull up on the block, pah
No need to question the dos' that I did
Huggin the block and spreadin the money, a park for the kids
You throw a mil up on the stones, you see how we do them rings?
(You sell drugs?) Who me? NAW, we don't do them things
Now to the block. I bring the Phantoms and the maybachs stay wit 'em
Pull up and park front of ya and let the children play in 'em
Go abroad, international, rep the hood non-stop
Though I proudfully rep my city, I thoroughly rep the block
And I'm probably next to really just come and be blast the pop off
THROW IT UP!! - and let me SEE my fellow blackstars
Yeah!!

[Chorus: Ray J] 
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
