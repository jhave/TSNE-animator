(Say, Face .. nigga, I think I can fade you now)
What, fade me how?
(Sheeit, on this rap shit)
Come on, nigga..

I brought my chopper and my hard hat
The shit's fucked up now show a nigga where the war at
Cause I'm about to clean house
Stick this a.k. up your ass and blow that fucker clean out
Cause you niggas in the wrong
You came up short and now we fin to get it going on
I ain't your average motherfucker
You step out of line and watch a motherfucker bust ya
Cause you done came at me the wrong way
I ain't no Clint Eastwood, nigga, and you done picked the wrong day
So bring your ass to the battleground
Rat-a-tat-tat, like that is how my gat'll sound
Avoid no niggas cause niggas be human
I squeeze the trigger and niggas be moving
Cause I don't point it in the air and pull the trigger (why?)
I'd rather point it at your ass and watch the nigga die
I gives a fuck about your team mates
When it's all said and done you're gonna wish you never seen 'face
You shoulda seen that lil nigga Brad
James through here, seen Dave and, yo that nigga bad
And your homies better stand still
Don't make my brother Warren bust one of you bitches cause the man will
Don't bring your ass to my picnic
Cause I done had it up to here with all you niggas talking that bitch shit
So you better get your shit right
I'm from the state where you rarely see a motherfucking fist fight
It's all about the gun blast
So you can miss me with that bullshit you spitting with your punk ass
It's the diary of a born killer
Don't have to worry about me falling off this thang cause I'm a strong nigga
Doubt my regard of the hard
With niggas behind me from East Oakland to the South Park
I've got the mind of the man right behind ya
You can run, you can hide but I'll still find ya
Like I say there's no getaway
And I'm gon' have it where your family'll have to throw your shit away
It's the return of the real niggas
I'm prejudiced to a certain extent but still I kill niggas
I'll bust that ass on the fucking double
So push on with that ho shit, bitch, cause you don't want trouble
So get your ass up of my shoestrings
And let your shermed nigga do things

Ay, ay, ay where you fin to go, fool?
(I can't fuck with it, you got it, man)
Come on, man .. you wanna rap, nigga?
(I can't do it) Come on
You see, you see! That's how motherfucker is, dogg
That's how motherfuckers be, punk ass hoes
You motherfuckers better quit fucking with me like this
That's really doe</pre>
