[Ice-T]
How many bullets can your back hold, suckin from the HK
The red dot's on your dome, from the light ray
Boom bam bust oh shit kid, your head is a pile of puss
I'm kickin up much dust, the nigga ya can't trust
This is my shit, my hood, my turf
My gold, my grip, whatever the fuck it's worth
I don't need nobody comin in my territory
tryin to rip a nigga off and fuck your fuckin sob stories

[Ice Cube]
Take a good look at my motherfuckin jacker
About to feel the wrath, of a greedy ass cracker
Pale as snow, so you know the hoe stand out
Comin in my hood with his hand out
Tryin to get over on the black, but the motherfuckin mack
will put a fuckin slug in his back
And with the boom ping ping, it ain't no thing to blast
on greedy motherfuckers that trespass

Chorus

[Ice Cube]
Olly olly outcome free, here come the G
I'm saggin, and Enter the Dragon like Bruce Lee
I gots to get mo' money mo' money
Can't get pussy with no money
See I'm kind of greedy, cause all my heroes
got zeroes in back of a one
Here's my gun, about to get paid at last
But now I'm gettin covered, in dirt and grass, kick it

[Ice-T]
The madder I get, the higher the debt, the deeper you get
The thicker the sweat
Cause I'm a nigga with fat clout
But ya in, but ya gotta get back out
No easy job, for some suckers is out to rob
Crosshair on your dome and your mind's blown
You wanna go home... ain't that a bitch?
Cube, dig the ditch (yep)

Chorus

[Ice-T]
I got a full time job of takin suckers out
Breakin em off, yea word, I love revokin clout
Test me, stress me, who could the best be?
The teflon nine go through vests G
But when you're greedy you don't care about life itself
You're chasin extreme wealth
You can't be trusted cause trust ain't in the fuckin game
Scandalous is your fuckin name

[Ice Cube]
I'm the motherfucker you're stuck wit
Ice Cube -- "Wronnnnnnng nigga to FUCK WIT!"
I'm rich, pitchin a bitch about gettin mo'
The big fish, swimmin in big dough
The G backstabber, I got ta have a
Lexus Coupe, when I troop
with the ski mask, gotta get the cash
My homeboy ain't home, so fuck it I'll trespass</pre>
