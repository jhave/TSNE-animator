Automata


I'm reading a book describing automata in practical terms - Automata 
Theory: An Engineering Approach, Igor Aleksander and F. Keith Hanna, Crane 
Russak, 1975. This is prior to Wolfram's main work of course on cellular 
automata; it's classical theory. In any case, as far as I can tell, given 
states and transitions, there is no indication _how long_ any particular 
transition will take; i.e. this isn't queuing theory. So one might 
consider the transitions occurring in present - as if digital-in-present, 
collapsed across what might otherwise be temporal, analogic. Given 
Wolfram's reformulation in A New Kind of Science, I wonder about the 
ontology (mathematical, even within an engineering approach) and epistem- 
ology (perhaps fundamentally discrete mathematics). Automata may at times 
be partitioned into independent automata; the substitution property is 
important here and seems to have implications for labeling. Again I'm 
thinking in terms of temporal collapse, flattening. In any case: 
"Formally, a partition of the set of states of an automaton has the 
substitution property if and only if each of its boxes maps into a single 
block under all possible inputs." And:

"The crucial significance of an automaton and an SP partition is that as 
far as next-state mappings are concerned [...], the states within a block 
could be considered as a _single state_ and an automaton could be found 
which behaves in the same way as the original automaton, but with only one 
state per block. This property is used directly in state minimization, as 
will be seen later." Further: "Given an SP partition of the states of an 
automaton, each block of which is completely output consistent, every such 
block may be replaced by a single state, providing a state-minimal automa- 
ton."

At this point, I'm well over my head (I've not reproduced the mathematical 
apparatus of course). The two points I want to make are: the possibility 
of state-minimal automatons as a rough model for language (think of the 
emblematic), and the collapse of temporality in relation to presencing 
present.

To push this analogy etc. into the realm of absurdity - consider a state- 
minimal automaton network or sememe (holarchy); if we average across the 
transitions as infinitesimals, can anything be located in relation to the 
appearance of time (as well as subjective time); second, consider one of 
the chaotic cellular automata described by Wolfram; if we average across 
the 'landscape' as it develops, can we consider this the origin of the 
analogic?

I realize neither my mathematics nor my grasp of automata concepts is 
particularly strong, but I wanted to throw this out (not literally) for 
comment -

Commentary, Visuddhi Magga


"Next, after he has put on his waist cloth as one who hides an abscess, 
and tied his waist band as one who ties a bandage on a wound, and robed 
himself in his upper robes as one who hides a skeleton, and takes out his 
bowl as one who takes out a pan for medicine, when he reaches the vicinity 
of the village gate, perhaps the sight of an elephant's carcase, a horse's 
carcase, a buffalo's carcase, a human carcase, a snake's carcase, or a 
dog's carcase, awaits him, and not only that but he has to suffer his nose 
to be assailed by the smell of them." - from Visuddhi Magga, The Path of 
Purification, by Buddhaghosa, trans. Nanamoli. 

"And thus, bhikkhu, what is enlightenment, what is the cessation of suf- 
fering, in the body that suffers, that does not comprehend what it does or 
does not suffer, which no longer understands beyond the pain of the wound, 
the disease? What is to be done with senescence, with delirium, with decay 
within which the name is no longer spoken, the ears no longer hear, the 
eyes no longer see, the mind no longer remembers the paths of meditation, 
nor does not remember to forget them, nor forget to remember them? And 
what, bhikkhu, if I am not in my right mind, if I am subject to such 
visions that I am the subject of such visions, if such visions are the 
breadth and depth of my world? What is then enlightenment, all but forgot- 
ten in the quagmire of nightmare which does not abandon me in the light of 
day? What then? What if it is the decay of my body that forms the decay of 
my body and the decay of my mind? What if, near death, I am not conscious 
of death, not conscious of world and non-world, not conscious of Buddha 
and non-Buddha, not conscious of dhamma, what then? For are we not always 
of this path of deterioration, of mental incapacity, of sickness unto 
death, are we not always of this path of inconceivability, impossibility, 
of such illness that the mind no longer speaks, nor thinks, nor imagines, 
nor dreams? And what is an exception to this, and what is the norm of 
this? And what are the vagaries of fevers, that nothing remains in focus, 
that pain cannot be banished from pain, what then? And must we not drive 
our body and our mind, but drive them just so far, before the limit and 
degree of cessation, before right-mind is lost, before dependent origina- 
tion is no longer cause for concern, no longer understood, spoken, in and 
out of mind, present and non-present, remembered and forgotten? Do we not 
teeter on the edge of the abyss before all is lost, before sickness car- 
ries us to the nonsense of meditation, the absurdity of absurdity? Are we 
not driven by our own instincts to crawl upon the earth, to swallow it, in 
order to remain alive, our mind no longer thinking, no longer ours, yours, 
no longer not-ours, not yours? What is enlightenment, what can be done, 
when there is nothing to be done, no one to be doing, no thing, no doing, 
but not language, memory, meditation, state, paradox, consciousness, 
dream, unconsciousness, nothing, not even the annihilation of death, not 
even cessation, not even the cessation of cessation, what then? For then 
there shall be no speaking, no asking, no remembering, no chanting, no 
meditation, no dreaming, no forgetting? And what then? For then there 
shall be pain, no pain, and what then? Mind disappears into ignorance, 
ignorance disappears. Why, bhikkhu, is there enlightenment at one time and 
not another? Why must one be healthy, or unhealthy, or hungry, or of 
satiation, or thirsty, or fulfilled? Why must one negate all desires, or 
negate none of them? Why enlightenment? Why purity, and why not impurity? 
When impurity breeds impurity, when ought is pure? When purity breeds 
purity, when ought is impure? Of what use, what concern, bhikkhu? When one 
no longer speaks of these things, when one can no longer speak of these 
things, when one can no longer speak, when nothing at all, what then?

"There are here in the Victor's Dispensation
"Seekers gone forth from home to homelessness,
"And who although desiring purity
"Have no right knowledge of the sure straight way --"

And what, bhikkhu, given all that I have said and thought, what if there 
is no knowledge, no right knowledge, no false knowledge, what of sickness 
and unthinking, what of dementia and no rightness, what if there is no 
way, what if there is no straightness, if the eye cannot see, the ear 
cannot hear, the mind cannot think, cannot unthinking, cannot desire 
purity or impurity, cannot desire, what if there is no mindfulness, what 
if there is no home? What then, bhikkhu, what then?



Track 16 Performance Text May 27 06


(Real-time typing/improvisation laptop performance with A/V files. We
had a fine audience.)

ST this is an 'abrupt start' usually i begin outside a gallery context
or in some other context, this is a difficult situation, after all the 
gallery's overdetermined i went to the Joan Jonas show today and for the 
past few days hope you saw it - by the way the image above is the 
Ukrainian revolution - anyway - the show was about memory and display and 
masquerade and gender but it was also about $180000, I think that's the 
right amount of zeroes, well that doesn' t matter but I'd have liked to 
have a copy of the DVD - artists tend to exchange dvds and poetry books 
(we're all fucking poor) and here within the institutionalization (love 
that word, it's like deterritorialization) of the gallery system we're 
barred, so damnit we should go ihn, but the show's closed and then - oh, 
the mp3's almost over - and make a bootleg of Jonas anyway if anyone has a 
bootleg we'll pay about ten dollars for it that's twice the new york 
street price - so - the doctor piece usually comes up later - somehwere 
about halfway through the piece - it just appeared early this time, i'm 
sorry, i hope it doesn't throw you off - it takes a while, I'm beginning 
but just beginning -- to sink into the images - that is, it's cranial - 
something will emerge, it might just take a while, please be patient and 
if not, well you've waisted only a little bit of time - every so often we 
try and _get on the screen _ = make some sort of connection - what this 
work is about, this work in general, screen images, that's all you're 
seeing here - connected with bodies in displayed or inconceivable 
positions - bodies appearing out of nowhere - bodies representative of 
empire - of broken desire - of things gone horribly wrong - if you read 
the history of the late roman empire - it becomes a history of chains, of 
tortures, of factions each intent on ravaging countrysides - it's not true 
people can live through anything - agriculture must have been destoryed - 
all for foreign wars - these were in - these were in main for the most 
part - Iraq - Persia then - toomany resources - what was going onat home - 
rome wasn't the ceneter any more - there were lots of emperors doing the 
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED bit back then - most of them were killed falling on 
their own swords - the Goths came in - other groups - that was about i t- 
now - it's about the same thing - different weapons -d own from the analog 
to the digital - things coming apart in pieces - inconceivable fucking -- 
bodies in untoward positions - there's no return - you just can't make 
heads like this can you? unless you're at war in which case you can make 
them any way you want -
Azure (on the right thank god) is dancing - you can hear her footsteps - 
so what - so what you're hearing - what's coming through - is radio - 
radio waves - this show is about transmissions - emissions - radiations - 
pollutions - so you're listening - that's the radio - the white box - you 
can hear very low frequency radio - she's interfering with the planhte' 
planet's atmosphere - literally - changing the radio patterning - that's 
what you're listening to - this is the sound - all of this - of the field 
telephone - in the tent in front of you - connected to Leslie Thornton's 
tent in the other room - when the batteries are in it - I shipped the 
batteries - they exploded on the way here - i didn't know it - I unpacked 
them - my hands were covered with acid, well I thought, we should just 
LOOK at them - this is a true story by the way - I don't know if you're 
paying attention - oh oh the phone , the tiny phone in the tent, loves 
listening to itself, it can finally have a mirror, it can say - this is 
what I sound like, LISTEN TO ME! - across the country we looked for places 
to record very low frequency radio - you have to be away from 
civilizaiton, specificlly the power grid - the electircal grid which 
interferes with it - that's what we're doing - going wherever ther's not 
that buzz, that interfering buzz - in any case - and in this image - in 
this image - there's something taken aparet - there's - a distortion, 
tension in the fac e- the face can be pulled apart - whjen you play:
1. war
2. digital
you can pull apart faces. Now I'm not saying that
war = digital = botox
nothing like that - but that all of these - it's like character trates - 
this is the conclusion of a silent film which I thought you might enjoy 
since th eonly voice here is my own - if yo haven't been in the trolley 
car - but first, notice the masts in the water - this is a sunken 
lightship off brooklyn - this is an `897 trolley - that's eighteen ninety 
seven - trolleys keep following me - they're the subject of this space - 
of bergamot - this is being moved - it's an electricla trolley - a book in 
the case - actually case two I think maybe not - in the room on the left - 
is called Benedict Arnold and is part of the Electrical Series - I think 
1858 - not sure of the date - it's next to a very old 1897 or thereabouts 
telegraph receiver - these are I think maybe in the same case? as the 
spinthariscope which contains radium from 1903 just around when it was 
discovered - the thing still works - and in the next cage - older analog 
behaviors - there are slides, perhaps you've noticed them? of 
tuberculosis, diptheria, plague, I forget the rest - things that rot your 
insides out, parasites, dead men walking - I think the slides are harmless 
now - I hope so, I've been handling them - they've been leaking - it's 
always worth while: DOUBLE YOUR YODEL (this is an aside) (to what?) - here 
comes Azure and myself at home - you can see we're losing focus here - but 
at least, wow what modelling!!! - the performer on the right - she'll be 
out in a moment - she's not performing - she's tuning - the sound - is 
from work I've done - somewhere in NY - not NYC - somewhere else - it's 
Anja Schmidt - who - I think - can become trance/en-tranced/entranced 
quickly - you will have to wait - it's there - there's always smething in 
the ditgital domain - iv'e worked with dancers - continue to work with 
dancers - first, dance is something I can't do - I'm impossible, I can't 
move at all - I'm traumatized - it's like war - it's like Speer walking 
round and round the prison after the war - I admire people who can move - 
who are free to move - who don't worry about it - who don't think about it 
- so I hve these opportunities - it's as if the world were murmuring - 
somewhere else beyond slaughter - somewhere into water - that is Maud 
dancing below - she gets tired - she repeatss herself - she can't continue 
repeating herself - she falls out - falls over - falls into line - falls 
out of favor - what fascinates me - in other words - is always, 
everywhere, the inconceivable - what possibilities exist beyond 
possibilities - what nestings are possible - for example - within the 
tents - within the fabric of the tents - outside the realm - of any other 
possibilities - outside the realm of slaughter - if I could assassinate - 
if I had the courage - I'd put an end to things - but behind every killer 
is another killer - I admit freely here - I'm a coward - I'm afraid of 
pain - afraid of killing - I wouldn't know how - wouldn't know what I was 
doing....
- this is radio radio - this is antennta azure - this is the sound of 
atmosphere - this is the fury of wire - and this - moreso - this is Foofwa 
d'Imobilite - working the wire - the same wire - it's antenna connected to 
vlf to recording device to speaker back into room back into wire vibration 
-
so where were we = within the analog realm of the real, nothing but 
slaughter: NOTHING but slaughter - within the digital realm of the real - 
REAL not VIRTUAL - nothing but REARRANGEMENT - tensor calculus - 
inconceivability - it returns to slaughter with a longer loop -
this show is called em/bedded - em/bedded with slaughter, bedded with 
slaughter - embedded in Iraq - following the troops of Rome into Persia - 
into slaughter - into inconceivable analog torture - EM/bedded - that dash 
or hyphen of the typographical - dividing words - leading you on - 
crashing against itself - as if there were somewhere to go - there's 
nowhere to go - I do hope you like the show - why am I here at this point? 
- this is where I'd rather be - THIS is where I'd rather be - by the way 
we're NOT in the trolley car now - there are usually two more projections 
ther e- if you haven't wandered in - this is somewhere else - what I can 
do - while speices are being slaughtered (three to four an hour, the 
verdict's not clear) - I can combine things - just as here - as if babies 
could do that: think of it - babies can't do that - CAN'T do that - but 
dancers CAN do that - and I can't do much of anything - earl
Earl
Earl
Earlier today I saw the Joan Jonas shhow again and - what was amazing, I 
thought, she's an artist, it's made to look easy, she's breathing that way 
- it's that way so smooth - kind of like Coleridge in fact thought about 
Wordsworth but that's another sotry - and then I thought - kind of like 
Coleridge - perhaps I should give up art altogether - at least this THIS 
kind of art - which makes no money and is CONTRIVED in relation to Joan 
Jonas - at least in relation to her =- and is orders of magnitue smaller 
than one hundred eighty thousand UNITED STATES DOLLARS - so then, well, 
I'd give away the dvds...
that's US on the right, and PREFAB on the left....
AND THANK YOU FOR COMING AND HOPE YOU ENJOY THE REST OF THE SHOW -

Thu Jun  1 11:55:44 EDT 2006 my life so far in blog order

2006 Worked with Foofwa and his company in Geneve twice; Azure went 
over with me once. The dance was Incidences. The experience was 
incredible for me - the dance intense and brilliant; he continues to 
break new ground.
2006 Successful show at Track 16 Gallery in Santa Monica, with Leslie 
Thornton. Called em/bedded, it features 12 channels of video/audio, 
including five projections, deals with war, sexuality, memory. For me 
an encapsulation of sorts - distorted avatar work of the past five 
years.
2006 Played music in public again for the first time in years, at Tonic 
(NYC); I'm also recording again. Working with alpine zither 
extensively, as well as the usual guitars. Started a blog. Feel like a 
hungry ghost.
2006 For the first time I wonder about my sanity. I can't take the 
pressure of joblessness, bad family relations, bad health and bad 
healthcare, lack of money, fear, nightmares, depressions, any more.
2006 Azure and I are still together and it is such a blessing.
2005 so long since anything's been put here. It's incredible. Nothing 
to say.
2005 have a headache from Gary's hammering today!
2005 This is just too harsh, to self-loathing, too selfish. I haven't 
contributed anything for six years. It's time I formally abandoned this.
2005 Residency in Santa Ana, Grand Central Art Center, for the summer. 
Two cds released.
2005 In October, Joanna and Eugene Lim marry; it was a wonderful 
wedding, and I'm feeling close to both of them. Family problems at the 
wedding; I stopped speaking to my sister and my father - I couldn't 
handle their attitudes towards me.
2005 I think this is when Firestation released The Songs and met 
Bernard Stollman of ESP again at an opening at Grand Central Artist 
Center.
2005 I sell both my Kathy Acker manuscript materials and James Lee 
Byars sculpture - I need the money.
2005 I see Tamara Bowers at that opening; she seemed incredibly sad to 
me, somewhat lost.
2001 Azure and I marry June 14th, reception July 14th.
1999 Cheryl Ito dies near the beginning of the year, found alone in 
apartment
1999 Appointed virtual writer-in-residence, Nottingham Trent 
University, England, beginning September through February 2000
1998 Potes and Poets brought out The Case of the Real, which I then 
revised online; earlier, I visited Jerry in Canberra, and considered 
going for the Phd. I begin to work on ideas of 's/ms' and develop 
Nikuko, who started in 1997
1998 November 2-15, tour of Southern California then in Dec., MLA 
Conf., SF
1998 Met Azure Nicole Carter, 22, in Huntington Beach - we begin an 
amatory correspondence...
1998 Late April trip to Kyoto with Lexie; Feb 20-March 20 in Australia 
with her
1998 Kathy Acker and Christine Tamblyn die
1998 Finally around November, divorce comes through with Allison Ritch
1998 August 15 to beginning of September, Lexie comes
1998 April 30 left Fukuoka to return jobless to New York
1997 za, They're partial or transitional accounts. They come and go. No 
matter how much you condemn me, I further condemn myself; I love and 
work in corners. That I haven't learned: to navigate. That I've lost 
custom. That I've never had.
1997 z, I use you "z" for coda, denouement. This is the jargon of 
autobiography, screen or peripheral memories, asides, eyes or bodies 
locked. I think I've learned nothing. I remember dates poorly. I 
haven't grown up. I endure the stories.
1997 Wrote the first version of The Case of the Real in Fukuoka; the 
Jennifer book is published; rewrote the book for Saul Ostrow in November
1997 Today I received a carton of my older work from Ted Byfield; it 
was sent to Robert Horvitz over the years. Horvitz and I had a falling 
out when Ellen and I split; he felt that I treated her badly, treated 
him badly, and used him. Later he apologized.
1997 Stromatolites, cyanobacteria, tendrils.
1997 November went to Fukuoka to join Lexie Don
1997 Met Lexie Don and fell in love with her hard, in 2 days, in New 
York. Now I try to understand this, and will meet her in Seattle, 
travel with her to Victoria to my brother's family.
1997 Lexie and I make a tour down the coast of Oregon; she had come to 
meet me in NYC for lunch, stayed for a few days, and I joined her two 
weeks later. Then after two weeks, returned to NY; two months later, to 
Fukuoka
1997 Late, I think, my brother Mark comes over and joins Lexie and me 
for four days
1997 January 7-22 worked with C\CEN in Sydney for economic development 
vis-a-vis the Internet, listened to Lisa MacArthur play strathspeys, 
wrote about freighters while staying at Kristin's and Jason's, returned 
to comparative emptiness.
1997 I think I'm so smart.
1997 I return over and over again to this, in an attempt to reduce the 
noise in my head, clarify the strands of incomprehensible thinking. I 
think: "my life's like gnarled sinew." I think: rhizomatic. And: "I owe 
everything to you."
1997 I lived at 4-7-7 Chiyo, Hakata-Ku, Fukuoka-Shi 812, Japn, 
81-92-633-6048
1997 But when Robert apologized, it was too late, and our friendship, 
which had existed from the early seventies, was over.
1997 Back in Sydney again for a second round, dealing with a wider 
range of issues, but less grass-roots...
1997 After the book launch party, Doctress Neutopia took photographs of 
me masturbating while having Net Sex; she said she'd place them on her 
Web Site - I never wanted to speak to her again.
1996 thought of this program as a way to begin to create an 
autobiography, everything ordered through dates...
1996 Worked through Mike Gurstein in Sydney, Nova Scotia, on pilot 
projects wiring up the province for community development (Internet); 
fell in love with Natalie MacMaster and her music; the woman never 
knew...
1996 I think Allison and I worked through some of our differences, but 
it was/is very shaky. 
1996 I meet Allison in Sydney after the Perth conference. She begins by 
telling me I treat women badly. I said I treated her badly possibly but 
she shouldn't generalize; she agrees. I said she treated me badly. 
Seeing her was intense.
1996 At the end of November, attended the Cybermind96 conference in 
Perth, Australia, where I was keynote speaker and participated in a 
number of panels; I also showed video and spoke at Murdoch, met Kim, 
Antonio, Jason, and Summa, among others.
1993 My first cyber-relationship experience with a grad student in 
Toronto; I met her on Chris Keep's postmodern list. (Maybe it was 
Kingston?) She asked me if we were cyber-fucking. Later we met in the 
NS library and didn't get along - depressing.
1993 Finally started on the Internet with an IBM XT. My first post was 
to the Derrida list. I met Michael Current after going on Future 
Culture through a recommendation by John Frost (through Robert Horvitz 
advertising the Art Papers issue).
1992 Margaret walked out after my severe depressions; she told me she 
was committed to me the day she left. I remember the truck pulling 
away, the expression on the face of her mother. I was stunned... She 
met her future husband within the hour.
1991 Or so, found out the ESP records had been reissued as CDs by ZYX 
records who never got in touch - how could they? I didn't even have a 
contract with Bernard (Bernie) Stollman for the second; it didn't 
matter. The stuff was out there, remembered.
1989-91 During the years with Margaret I had the feeling we could get 
in the car and go _anywhere_ and we did. Even with depression, 
fighting, silences, the trips were ecstatic and moments of intense work 
for me - hours of video, film, audio, and writing.
1989 Margaret and I are driving through western North Carolina; it's 
summer or spring and I start crying. I've never been so happy; I know 
I'll never be so happy again. She's behind the wheel of the red Civic. 
I'm watching _everything._
1989 At the end of the year, Margaret and I left Atlanta for New York. 
I thought we'd last forever. We felt hounded out of town; everyone we 
knew "sided" with Nancy and condemned our relationship. People went 
silent when we walked in the room...
1988 I took up the Artistic Directorship of Hallwalls Contemporary 
Artcenter in  Buffalo, of which I have already written.
1988 I became Artistic Director at Hallways Contemporary Arts Center. 
The job was a disaster, and the position undefined. I fought it all the 
way, having arguments in particular with Chris Tebes, the new executive 
director. By April I had resigned.
1988 I also met Nancy Golden while at Hallwalls; this was the beginning 
of another disaster. She moved in the day we met, upon my invitation; 
we got along for the first two weeks or so, before psychosis and 
hysteria set in. I never behaved so badly.
1988 And I had never been treated so badly as I was with Nancy. She 
threatened to kill me when we split, after I had met Margaret, and had 
become all too close to Shellie Fleming, the film Curator at Image in 
Atlanta. I didn't behave well with Shellie.
1987 When she left me, Denise had worn a sore into her forehead, out of 
pure tension. She never disagreed with anything I said; we were both 
frustrated and mad with each other. She left suddenly; she had to. We 
were devouring ourselves.
1987 Denise tied me up, spread her period across me; she urinated on 
me; another time, she drew a perfect cunt between my asshole and prick. 
I was ecstatic, transported; I sucked her tampax. Images made a perfect 
grid on the wall, counterpoint to music.
1986 I first met Denise at a punk/industrial music night; her musicians 
didn't show up and she played with our group (Damaged Life). She moved 
in a week later. Her voice was incredible; she immediately replaced our 
singer and all the other musicians.
1985-87 I left Nexus, Allison left me, I went to University of Texas at 
Dallas, under Dean Robert Corrigan's multi-disciplinary program; 
fourteen of us arrived and eleven left by the end of the two years. I 
met Denise.
1985-6 Later Paul Celan's poetry would take off from where Theresa 
began; his poetry of elegy and holocaust related to the pure milk skin 
memories of desire I still retain - perhaps an afterthought, 
afterbirth, projection...
1984 At Nexus, we began the Atlanta Biennale; the first exhibition cost 
only $800. One of the few times I felt I did "good" for people. The 
show was hung salon-style and involved an alternative arts community 
that had rarely shown.
1983-85 After teaching for a semester at Ontario College of Art, with 
Allison staying in Amherst, New York, because she couldn't cross the 
border (we fought, were depressed), I took up the curatorship at Nexus 
in Atlanta.
1983 I take over the curatorial position at Nexus Contemporary Arts 
Center. Allison and I move to Atlanta. I get drunk at the first 
opening/function I attend, go home and have a horrific breakdown, 
putting my head through the wall. Allison freaks.
1982 In Queenstown we end up at the home of a Belgian hairdresser on 
the outskirts of town; the home is made of television set cabinets. He 
gives us whatever we look at. All of us I think are very close to 
breakdown. I don't remember where I got the time.
1982 I went to Tasmania where I met Allison Ritch and returned with 
her; before that, I wrote Tamara Bowers (who I had slept with at Irvine 
and who wrote back telling me to go to hell) and June, who never wrote 
back after the first letter.
1982 I left for three and a half years - to teach in Tasmania - lasted 
three and a half months, returning with Allison Ritch; I was asked to 
resign. The only time in my life I drank, and the closest I've come to 
a nervous breakdown.
1982 Allison and I left for Queenstown in the eastern center of the 
island. We were warned we might be killed; we got off the bus and 
traffic stopped. People pulled over to the side of the road and 
watched. We ran back in, dressed as punks, terrified...
1980-1982 I taught at UCLA for two years, in the art and art history 
departments. I met Sungja Lee and we lived together for a year, 
traveling back to Montreal. Allison Rossiter said I mistreated her. She 
spoke English badly, accusing me of everything.
1980 The year where my writing began to coalesce; I was 37 already. 
Lived with Laura Hayes for part of the year in Montreal and was there 
for the Quebecois referendum. I discovered Nicole Brossard, feminin 
ecriture, and Hubert Acquin; they resonated.
1980 I saw Vito for one of the last times, and stopped speaking to him; 
I couldn't take his notion of "my generation / your generation" and 
remembered all too well his sexism, mild deceit, and the feeling that I 
had been used.
1980 I get involved with women who are as crazy as I am; no one saner 
would put up with me. My relationships are characterized by extremes of 
intensity, hysteria, exhaustion, sexuality. I'm worn out, wear people 
out. A bad catch...
1978-1979 I taught for a year at the University of California, Irvine; 
I left Ellen and joined Laura Hayes in Hartford, commuting to Montreal 
weekly to teach at Concordia University, and University of Ottawa.
1978 Remembering Laura Hayes, who became an erotic image / imaginary 
for me, for almost a decade, remembering her in a garden, wooden house, 
parents, sunlight bright in Pennsylvania, her small breasts, intensity, 
eyes, eyes, eyes.
1977-1997 Relating to Joanna; I never see her enough; as she gets older 
I can relate more and more to her, an indication of my own failings. 
I've always been honest with her, as best I can, only when younger, 
keeping my work from her; it's disturbing.
1977 The Whitney shows the tape Kathy Acker and I made; there's a guard 
at the door. My parents go; I've asked them not to. I agree only if 
they never mention the show to me. Worlds fall apart. Over the years, 
Kathy and I make $2000-$3000 from the tape.
1977 Tamara Bowers fucking me, the first and only totally rewarding 
anal sex, her saying I've had my eyes on you for a long time, later - 
now, I remember, having written this before, and then, later, in 
Tasmania, her telling me to go to hell...
1977 Secretly, I think I know everything.
1977 Joanna was born; I was totally unprepared. Everyone's relationship 
to me immediately changed; I couldn't handle it, and Ellen wouldn't 
hear of a babysitter at this point. Tensions became really difficult; I 
left for Irvine, and Ellen came later.
1977 I taught for a year in Hartford, at the Hartford College of Art.
1977 Around this date I thought that if aliens came from another world, 
they would contact me, because I comprehended the world, as much as 
possible. I would dream like this, reminiscent of when a child, 
salvaging planets, desires, beings, being.
1976-1977 I work on the Structure of Reality, a text composed of the 
hysteria of information, network theory, annihilation in 
code-particles. It's printed in Halifax and Williams College, two 
editions. Parts surface later in an article in C magazine.
1975 Rosemary Mayer and I split vowing to remain friends. It didn't 
remain that way. During this period, I worked with Laurie Anderson; I 
was somewhat in love with her - that same kind of damaging worship that 
affected me with Margaret.
1975 Around this period, Laurie accompanied me at a poetry reading at 
St. Mark's On-the-Bowery. She borrowed a videocamera from me, and set 
it up in her loft, aimed out the window. An image was burned in; she 
had to replace the tube.
1974 Rosemary warned me about Vito, that he wasn't as good a friend as 
he said. He told her I was a pest, told me the same about Dara 
Birnbaum, told her the same about me, told me the same about Rosemary. 
Acconci was always in control.
1974 Logic of consciousness worked out, The Book as System of Military 
Defense (about Tina Weymouth), The Fourteen Stations of the Cross 
presented at St. Mark's Church (influenced by Rosemary Mayer), Two 
Suites of Figure Drawings, Acker/Sondheim tapes.
1974 I lectured all over the place, UCSD, Cal Arts, RISD (with Kathy), 
Yale (with Kathy), Wesleyan, etc. Kathy and I parted dubious friends. 
Later she told Allison I was crazy; Allison told me; I told Allison 
Kathy was crazy.
1974 Around this time, I remember living off and on with Rosemary 
Mayer; she left the loft one day, and I said Take care of yourself, and 
she said, I always do...
1973-1974 I went to Europe with Beth; we lived for a month in 
Copenhagan (where we made love with a voyeur watching across, from one 
empty apartment to another) and longer in Paris, where I was in the 
Paris Biennale.
1973 At the Paris Biennale I put up "The World's Smallest Sculpture" 
created with a scanning electron microscope; a piece based on an 
assassination of President Nixon; and diagrams relating to the "general 
structure" of the world.
1969 Vito and I in our dismally-cathected relationship, talked about 
swapping women (they never would have gone along); I already sensed 
something was wrong with June and me...
1968 I think June and I were married; it was a traditional wedding. I 
was afraid of her father's anti-semitism. Our fucking was unsuccessful; 
I had forgotten Noney who might have still been in the asylum. 
1968 I lived for a summer in Minneapolis with June.
1968 I had An,ode published by the Waldrops' Burning Deck Press in 
Providence. An,ode was my M.A. thesis - a work of experimental poetry 
(so-called); Keith Long from RISD did the cover. It was my first real 
publication, however slight.
1968 I bought a red IBM Selectric, my first real electric typewriter, 
which I used for years, did An,ode on. Later it went to Jerry and Joe 
in Dallas; as far as I know (1997), they still have it, almost worn 
out... I loved the feel and the sound and...
1967-1970 Did I speak of the Great Fear of country and anarchy I had, 
that it wasn't my own madness setting in, that it was elsewhere, the 
destruction of all good things, that I was doomed, cowardly, unable to 
cross the line, conservative secretly?
1967-1968 Put out three records with a group, two with ESP, one 
independent. Greg Johnson kept things under control (played flute); 
only later could I break out. The ESPs got a bad review later in the 
Penguin Encyclopedia of Jazz. They sung.
1967 Paul Geremia ran into the studio screaming Noney's just tried to 
kill herself and holding me responsible.
1967 Lost my virginity to Noney; she was 15 at the time and I was 24. 
She hung around the music group I was forming. I moved into her 
parents' house; they knew. Things began to go very wrong. She'd been 
abused at the age of 4. I owned a fire siren.
1967 It's around now I'm in Europe. I met you (I forget your name) - 
knew you from Israel. You saved me. I wanted to take pills, kill 
myself. You gave me some, said take them. Vitamins. I tried to fuck a 
black woman who wanted me. I couldn't, cried.
1966 Went to Europe for the summer; met Joel Zabor who became the 
drummer of the group; stayed at a Borstal in Dover (they thought I was 
on drugs).
1962-1963 Went to Israel for a year, living mainly in Jerusalem. Took 
an overdose of opium, had jaundice, saw wonders.
1962 was still, closed up once again. I asked my roommate what it was; 
he kept saying "a textile factory." But there was something else gone 
on...
1962 We managed to get shot at from an absurdly safe distance on the 
Galil in Israel, while witnessing a battle between Israelis and 
Syrians. At the UN, the former were condemned; in real life, it was all 
to clear that the latter had started the attack.
1962 Was it during this year, when I was in Israel, that my grandfather 
died? That my cat died as well? I returned home at a loss; I hadn't 
been told. My other grandfather died, I think, in 1953, the result of a 
car accident (maternal).
1962 On a trip through the Negev, I saw, from a distance, an atomic 
facility that was, we "knew" intended for the development and 
production of nuclear weapons.
1962 It was this year that I got beat up on the campus by two townies 
who broke my nose, left me covered with blood; I went looking for a 
friend of mine, hoping to scare him. I was an idiot. A guard insisted I 
go to the hospital. My nose is still bent.
1962 I watched the side of the factory open up in the middle of the 
night and a machine (I later identified as an atomic cannon) wheel out, 
run to the end of the valley in Jerusalem, its turret revolving, turn 
around, and go back. Next day, the factory 
1962 I think I remember fumbling with a student from RISD; she had me 
incredibly erect; I didn't know what to do and couldn't do it; these 
were suicidal ecstatic events.
1961-1962 My second year at Brown was miserable. I hated my roommates; 
one of them spent a semester making toothpicks out of a log. I felt 
tormented. My writing was horrible. I didn't know what I was doing; I 
wanted to escape. Hell.
1961 I almost flunked out of school. My life was a disaster.
1960-1997 Sleeping and waking: insomnia goads me my entire life; there 
are days I can't sleep, days I do nothing but; lowered body temperature 
is accompanied by horrific feelings of submergence and fuzziness; I 
never am fully awake.
1960 These dates, these beginnings are obscure to me, and always have 
been; I bounced myself off of every wall in existence, barely making it 
through the first year, hating the others, but it was at least better 
than highschool misery.
1960 The depressions continue for the rest of my life
1960 It's this summer I first go to Israel and almost have a religious 
conversion. I feel relieved that Jew isn't a dirty word, that the 
blasted images I received from reading the Nuremberg trials (medical 
report) have started to clear out...
1960 It was around this period that I had my only "attested" psychic 
experience, with Patti Rogers. She tried to kill herself at Syracuse; I 
was at Brown, and suddenly, walking back to Pembroke, realized I had to 
call her; I did, and calmed her down.
1960 I went to Israel for a summer, living largely in Jerusalem, almost 
became religious, meandered around the country.
1960 I volunteered for secret army tests as well - checking out reflex 
times; I came out extremely high.
1960 I remember reaching for Ann's breast; I was sick and at her 
grandmother's. I couldn't behave myself. At one point we yelled about 
breaking each other's arms. I was working at a Settlement House in East 
Harlem; her parents had arranged this.
1960 I just about flunked my first semester at Brown, collapsing until 
I learned to hold myself back, give the faculty what they wanted, 
hating it all the time...
1960 Barely made it to the senior prom with Cheri Kanjorski (sp?) who I 
think really hated me; we went over to Don Evans' afterwords and the 
lights were off and I knew secret sexualities were going on and I was 
jealous and Cheri went with me from despair.
1960 Ann Welsh or Walsh was my first real girlfriend; we tried to fuck 
and didn't succeed and I was impotent until I was 24. I was completely 
hysteric and insecure with her; her parents finally broke us up.
1959 I'd fall asleep dreaming of Platt Townend or earlier Margaret 
Hall, always saving them, somehow, desperately, they'd turn toward me, 
I'd take care of them, everything would be all right, eternal life and 
devotion, tears on my pillow, sentiment...
1959 I was probably a Junior at the Blue and White dances at Wyoming 
Seminary, hopelessly in love with Platt Townend, yes, dancing 
breathless with her, letting her go, fly across the room. She would 
never have had me, never wanted me, danced out of pity.
1958 Johnny Uhl and I were walking late at night and he threw at the 
neon inn sign and it fell like smashed glass and I didn't tell but was 
never so scared in my life. The world too smashed. I was a coward.
1956-8 I joined the American Forestry Association (or something with a 
similar name) and had images of trees on the walls; I flitted from one 
to another - I couldn't really identify with them. I also had the runic 
alphabet up. I cried myself to sleep.
1956-60 I cried myself to sleep, etc. I had a small box on the bed 
table; I'd keep a list of best friends in it as well as a list of 
"things to do" so I could surprise myself - some sort of obscene proxy.
1956 Later this year (or was it this year?), I masturbated ceaselessly 
in the shower and bathtub; sperm stuck to me, everywhere. I associated 
masturbation with urination, retaining the urine, spurting both on 
myself, ecstatically.
1956 I watched someone masturbate at camp; I was thrilled. Early 
homoerotic memories, not genitally-centered. He masturbated on the 
bleachers; I forget his name.
1956 I heard of Elvis. I loved the word "fuck." Someone showed me 
Elvis' picture in the paper. At camp, camp.
1955 Around this time, I had an operation to have my ears pinned back; 
it was traumatic, hideous; the novacaine didn't remain local and I had 
70 injections, ended up screaming; always felt I was deformed; still 
remember the cutting, the flesh, the sound.
1952 It was around this year that we moved from Reynolds Street to Ford 
Avenue. I don't think I was friendly with the Brennans any more. We 
used to fight with serrated pieces of wood. The screendoor had a tear 
in it.
1952 I remember a wonderful British tricycle with large wheels, painted 
black. I remember a red wagon. I remember...
1952 I really don't have a date but wonder about my early love for 
Theresa who worked for the family and who I think went to an asylum. 
All my memories are like this, vague dates, worried and blanked 
memories. I remember golden hair.
1950 I was given a small film projector with a crank on the side; it 
was crinkled black with a translucent window for viewing the animated 
cartoons.  All  of my work has stemmed from this.
1950 All through childhood I had to take weekly Saturday allergy shots; 
I was terrified; my arm would swell up like a molten hive. I had hives 
as well in my hair and in camp, once, a huge swollen lip from chewing 
on a plant stem. Grotesque.
1948 Or thereabouts - remembering crying in the car with mother, 
worried that if she kept kissing me, she'd run out of kisses; already I 
was frightened, gathering security and comfort where I could, this very 
early memory.
1943-1997 I have had my faults.
1943 There are early screen memories of _being carried_ on a medical 
gurney past rows of medication bottles; the lighting was fluorescent, a 
nurse pushing the cart - I remember everything from the position of 
_being behind_ her.
1943 I did not ask to be born.

For those who hate the way I am:
If I were otherwise, I could not produce the work I do.
For those who hate the work I do:
If it were otherwise, I would not be alive.

And for those who hate both:
You are dead to me. You are dead.

em/bedded mass - phenomenology of substance


The show em/bedded . 

There will be antennas and field telephones. The large room will be all [] 
There would be a small tent in the large room, possibly, off-kilter, 
conncted to a tent in the small room. I'm not sure yet about the Trolley 
Car. We want to put video in there, there are places to sit. It's like an 
underground. One possibility that would work - just field telephone calls 
[] Leslie work opens up into spaces that my work tends to close down. We 
share a sense of imminent catastrophe, as well as, to be honest, brilliant 
imagery, seductive even in its deadliness. [] In the small room, we will 
have memorabilia collections, whatever we can send across. These include 
photographs of Iwo Jima from Azure's grandfather (on the ground), a 
battle-map of Iwo Jima on site, things [] I want VLF radio somehow present 
- I'm not sure about this. I can bring or send the radios out; we can see 
what we might pick up around Bergamot, and to save batteries, we might as 
well tape the stuff and have it play from a cd player or some such. I want 
to possibly erect a signal kite in the central space with an antenna wire 
coming down - we might actually be able [] The VLF radio relates to the 
'primordial' of life, to actual fundamental particles themselves, to the 
resonances of particular spaces. The videos relate to histories, memories, 
sexualities, pleasures, absences, presences. The more we have going the 
better. We need to check on the []

The tents in the outer room are half-tents, partially attached to the 
framework of the building, partially floating. They are as nomadic as 
signifiers, language flushed out of its lair. But the tents are real, 
canvas; an air of depression hangs over then, a fog. They are in the midst 
of an image storm, a continuous splay, spew, emission, of violence, 
sexuality, cloned grotesques, the crackling of radio, electricity. The 
work occurs in the far future - mutations, extinctions, broken spaces of 
information. The work occurs in the past - organisms huddled as if 
protected against the fury of the world, primitive electrical machines 
tuned into atmosphere and universe. The distorted bodies are our own of 
course, in the present, of course. The work offers no solution - there 
isn't any - but presents a distorted beauty of its own. The field 
telephones connect the tents in the smaller and larger room. The kite 
connects the tent in the outer room to the atmosphere. The tents in the 
outer room are splayed, dysfunctional, as if attempting, and failing, to 
rise form the ground. The tent in the inner room is home to images, to a 
space of looking, watching. The tents are WWII tents, resonant with the 
materials in the smaller room, with the video and tent of Leslie Thornton. 
Think of the in both rooms as along a sightline, faultline. HELLO HELLO.

Antigone

Between the space of the lens and the screen, the trapezoidal space of 
projections, projective space; it's here that the body finds haven, that 
interruptions disturb, that flattening presences discursive spaces: you 
are the visible omen, content demarcation. This is the space of neural 
interiority against the scythe of the image from disk to di/splay. The 
thin edge of the picture splatters from the wall, reassembles at every 
junction of perception. This is another actant, drama. One reads the 
splatter as content; it's as if the thetic confined itself to a certain 
materiality. But it is within the intermediary space, for example the 
project/projections on the interference of the body, that the imaginary 
operates. Doesn't modernism itself play on this intermediary? In any 
case, the video below, ungainly and long, contains the seed of Antigone.
