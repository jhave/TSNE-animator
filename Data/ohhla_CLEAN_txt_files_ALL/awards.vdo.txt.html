[Verse 1]
YSL Duffle be my carry on, YSL buckle just to carry chrome (uh huh)
Watching niggas hustle, ya'll could carry on (I see you)
You cannon's in the crib like Mariah Carey home (whoo)

Like no lie give him 45 he bring 10
I mean when cause right now downtowns where them fiends been (real shit)
Time to turn up, that's your word nigga word up, (uh huh)

Roll some weed let it burn up (yeahhh)

Any beef that you heard of

Uh that port will spur off on some bullshit

I see your hand out but don't dap that's some bullshit

[Chorus]
Yo while ya'll was at the BET awards

Pinned him up from his shoes in a dark room nigga,

[Chorus]
Yo while ya'll was at the BET awards, I was was cooking up

While ya'll was at the BET awards, I waz cookin up

They talk fly but wasn't speaking up before, (nahhh)

[Verse 3]
Look his numbers 48 got him for 42 (yes)

Hope shorty straight he moved about 40 through, (I know)
he let the 40 spray but them niggas had 40s too (whoo)
Since a quarter two been moving caine from the bench, (uhh)
on the move only know the names through the prints (vado)
CL black same paint on the rims, chanel snapback gold chain on the brim, (yes)
Gazelles match that rocking pharrell napsack, (uh huhh)
gat strapped nose on your windshield tap tap, (haaaaa)
It's a fact that grinding is where you lack at
a stack stack ain't enough you'll be up in the trap trap

[Chorus]
Yo while ya'll was at the BET awards
I was was cooking up, fire high heating up the raw (haaaaaaa)
They talk fly but wasn't speaking up before

While ya'll was at the BET awards
I waz cookin up fire high heating up the raw (haaaaa)
They talk fly but wasn't speaking up before, (nahhh)
red carpet, suit, tie, sneaker strings is on the floor (floor)</pre>
