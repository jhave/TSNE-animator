[Big Scoob]
Big Scoob! That's my nigga rippin it up
Put the hood up on my shoulders man I'm lifin it up
Tip in my cup, still a nigga givin a fuck
You can get touched, pussy nigga spillin them guts
Man they wanna see the boss don, I be stompin on the hardest streets they walk on
Old nigga but my knuckle game is still on, it's still strong
You can test it nigga watch me get my vill on, yeah!!
I ain't changed nigga hungry for bread, left me for dead, duckin dodgin shakin the feds
What they missed nigga so I'm back searchin for mine, fresh off the grind
Still gutta sick with these rhymes, flippin these lines, you can see the truth in my eyes
Never no lies, leven vill screamin with pride
Till the day that they rest me, hog stylin gutta livin villain that's me
(Tell em who you talkin bout)

[Tech N9ne]
The way I, drink heavy when I party n shit, the way I disrespect a bitch and say sorry n shit
The way I, make it switch it from red to dookie brown, spot a curve and dope boss dogg and lay em down
On the roads and be no lost cause and wait around
Show them hoes there'll be no toss drawers till you pay the hound
The way I refrain, from hangin with simps and never fuckin with shrimp that ain't deveined
The way I smash for the cash, the way I mash harder (FLASH!)
Caught a broadcast on the blast with a last broader
Why I'm half martyr, The reason I take showers cuz I don't like sittin in ma ass water
My reason for red chucks and red laces, my reason for fuckin up and never catchin fair cases
The way I go so hard on the liquor, vill livin is a given and create it because of my nigga
(Scoob!!)

[Big Scoob]
Mayne I'm back and I'm hungry, big homie from the show me niggas know me
Only villain take a yic and then I cloning, Real talk I can give it how you want it
I can put you niggas on that 5-6, villain niggas movin the crowd, and I'm tryna make Strange
Put some hog in they style, dogg and I'm wild, vans left the bark on the ground
Stompin him out, pussy nigga runnin his mouth, but for now imma changed man
OG so I'm stickin to the game plan, takin papers makin moves like a grown man
Vill steppin in the seven first up for the field plan
And you can get it if you want it with me, definitely, I can give you more than you need
Gutta livin and I'm screamin the V, wherever I be, that's how you niggas know that it's me</pre>
