[Chorus: Kool Keith]
I drop money down, now get that money girl (ahh)
I drop money down, now get that money girl (ahh)
I drop money down, now get that money girl (ahh)
I drop money down, now get that money girl (ahh)
I drop it

[Kool Keith]
My beat go {?}, while she flip and grab the pole
Jump jump jump jump jump, move it like a dump truck
Face get fixed up, niggaz get mixed up
Who's the phone now, who's that pickin up
Dark face, mask on, everybody's stickin up
Everybody's quakin up, jewels start bakin up
Come to the back and count to the back, lil' kids love that
I'll be the first to say if you butt sound whack
Long-faced bastard, nothin you, mastered
Any girl you talk to, walk and try to ask her
She don't want you think, nigga what you faster
Tryin to top me, never will you stop me

[Chorus]

[Kool Keith]
You're skilled in surgery, you dirty B, you got no courtesy
You birded B, you heard of me, impressively
You got no style and me I'm smilin B you whylin B I'm ballin B
You silent G I'm bout it B you pout at me you doubted me
What's yo' name black-ass?  I'ma tame whack-ass
Make his beard grow, make it make his beard grow
Make his beard grow, make it make his beard grow
I'm on the corner sometimes, I'm on the corner with rhymes

[Chorus]

[Kool Keith]
You got your last chance last man, I'ma start to laugh man
Sweat like a hot room, now you gonna need a fan
Bust a verse for ten grand, bust a verse witcha man
Beginning to ending man, beginning to ending plan
Hustle the game, shuffle the game, my shoes scuffle the game
Kid average come around and they rhyme the same
The whore store get you caught up and burned up in flames
Flames, flames

[Chorus] - 2X (minus last line first time)
