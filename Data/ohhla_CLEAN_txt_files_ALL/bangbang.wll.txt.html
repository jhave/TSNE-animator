Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse]
I love her, can't leave her
Forever I'll always need her
She lie, but I believe her
Lovesick I got that fever
Love stupid, I know it
Love stupid, I know it
I know, cause I'm a fool in love

My baby shot me down again
Shot me down with the love and it go bang bang
That girl's a killer from a gang
Shot me down with the love and it go bang bang

And oh, I love her so, that's why I gotta let her know
That I'll be here for her to always love her down

And maybe that's the truth
The clock can tick and ain't no use
I wonder when my tux can see you when you're down

[Chorus]
Bang, bang
Got him with a bang
Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang
Got him with a bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang
Got him with a bang
Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang
Got him with a bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

[Verse]
I love her, can't leave her
Forever I'll always need her
She lie, but I believe her
Lovesick I got that fever
Love stupid, I know it
Love stupid, I know it
I know, cause I'm a fool in love

My baby shot me down, down, down, down
Shot me down with the love and it went pow-pow
I love my baby's freaky style
But my baby's always sneaking out

But damn, I love her so
That's why I gotta let her know
That I'll be here for her, I'll always be her man
And baby, that's the truth
You're my chick, bottlecruise
I got that roof, I put that diamond on her hand

[Chorus]
Bang, bang
Got him with a bang
Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang
Got him with a bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang
Got him with a bang
Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang
Got him with a bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah, I love my baby
Hey baby yeah I love you
Stupid is what stupid do
Tom and Jerry and Scooby Do
Oh baby, I'm a fool for you
Come here, baby, be my lollypop
I make it better, make the booty drop
Hey baby, can't get you out my brains
Damn girl, you're such a sexy thing
Pretty little lady
And my baby makes me go down down
My baby makes me go down down
My baby makes me go down down
My baby makes me go down down</pre>
