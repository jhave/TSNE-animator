Song:   Maybe You Can Hold Me

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Starve me, beat me, then chastise me
Love me never leave me, I see it super-sized
Work me, sculpt me, maybe you can mold me
Never spare your rod, maybe you can hold me, hold me

[Bizzy Bone]
Starve me, beat me, then chastise me
Love me never leave me, I see it super-sized
Work me, sculpt me, maybe you can mold me
Never spare your rod, maybe you can hold me

With the I.V. stuck in my arm, and I'm calm
Feelin at peace, through this madness, through this song
My darling's gone, and my family, is left in sadness
There is no more money to give, everybody's glad-less
This is the life, that I live, and my breath that we breathin
And I'm without any blood, and it's only blue bleedin
Just a wretch, and I just sometimes did wanna be alone
Lord God the Father will you please take me home?
Cause Jesus is our Lord and our savior
Beautiful Jesus your love is so major, born in a manger
I thank ya.. for yo' sacrifice
I feel my spirit is in danger (danger, danger)

[Chorus]  2X

[Bizzy Bone]
Starve me, beat me, then chastise me
Love me never leave me, I see it super-sized
Work me, sculpt me, maybe you can mold me
Never spare your rod (never spare your rod, spare your rod)

Defend me my dear Lord, that's when I need you
Make me pay for what I've done wrong ten-fold
And the love is still in danger, please let me not be a stranger
to the tender and the kindness.. {*echoes*}
Lift the shame up off me, God I feel so dirty
But Jesus is our Lord and our savior
Beautiful Jesus, your love is major, born in a manger
You know I thank ya.. for yo' sacrifice
Jesus our Lord and, Jesus our savior
Beautiful, Jesus, your love is major
Born in a manger, you know I thank ya
For yo' sacrifice, I feel my spirit's in danger
Starve me, beat me, then chastise me
Love me never leave me, I see it super-sized
I said this hospital isn't any place for yo' light
And regardless of the situation there's always love from life
And the charges of inception, failin inspection
Remember it's only one, it's only one
Jesus our Lord and, our Lord and savior
Beautiful Jesus, your love is major
Born in a manger, you know I thank ya
For your sacrifice, I feel my spirit's in danger

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Starve me, beat me, then chastise me
Love me never leave me, I see it super-sized
Work me, sculpt me, maybe you can mold me
Never spare your rod (never spare your rod, spare your rod)

[Chorus]

[Outro: Bizzy]
Starve me, beat me, then chastise me
Love me never leave me, I see it super-sized
Work me, sculpt me, maybe you can mold me
Maybe you can hold me
Maybe you can hold me
Maybe you can hold me, hold me, hold me
Just love me, never leave me
I see it super-sized</pre>
