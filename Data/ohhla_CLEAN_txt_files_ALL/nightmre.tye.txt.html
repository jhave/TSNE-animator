{So... you tell me that everythin just isn't goin well}
{Well, first off}

[Tyler, the Creator]
My only problem is death
Fuck heaven! I ain't showin no religion respect
Brain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret
Talkin to me is like a fuckin body missin a neck
But, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off
Life is a bitch and my cock's soft, the Glock's cocked
My hands trembled, my finger's slipped, the wall's red
Her life is fucked, she's sad now, her son is dead

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
or in your day dreams, that's how death seems

[Tyler, the Creator]
When I was younger I would smile a lot
I'm gettin older, gettin bolder, but a wiser top
Now I'm drunk drivin, lap's full of Budweiser tops
Life is a movie and you're just a prop
They begged me to stop, but I listen like deaf drums
Love? I don't get none
That's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some
My father called me to tell me he loved me
I'd have a better chance of gettin Taylor Swift to fuck me
Annoying and I'm ugly, most niggaz wanna punch me
I'm surprised the fuckin doctor even touched me
Feel like Humpty, you hopin that I'll fall? Fuck y'all
I'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant
Ignorant as fuck, offend people for the hell of it
because I am the devil, fucker get on my level
Doughnuts and ki's and kick-flips Supremes and markers
My life is Ms. Monique Parker
But a little darker
I'll see you in a couple
O.F.

[Chorus]

{Tyler, here's some water man, you...}
{You seem a little tense...}
{How's uh... how's Thebe?}

[Tyler, the Creator]
All because a nigga just don't give a fuck
Parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fuckin up
But fuck that, you're a shitty parent, face it, suck it up!!
That's what you shoulda did before that nigga bust, huh
Feel like I missed my little brother growin up
Feel like my little brother missed his brother growin up
But this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growin up
I got a little taller since the last time you seen me bruh
Now I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm po'n up
But I never had a drink (Sydney, Tyler's throwin up!)
My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough
I won't feel the feelings I be feelin when I'm sobered up
But that's a fuckin lie, why would he say that I'm
as emotionally straight as Travis when he's... {Tyler, calm down}
Don't look at me, I'm 6'5", about to fuckin cry
about another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die
I finally had a family
Domo's in another state, and where the fuck is Riley?
Now you niggaz wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
but before the co-signin and you fuckers couldn't find me?
Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death
One ear I got kids screamin, "O.F. is the best"
The other ear I got Tron Cat, askin where the bullets and the bombs at
so I can kill these levels of stress, shit
They say that I'm shock value
How about you hop off cock and turn volume down?
I haven't got around to tellin my mom shit {why?}
Cause I don't know how to... {whoa}
All I want is her support, whenever the fight's at home
when mommy cusses out cousin, some knives get shown
Now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown
And hit her in her fuckin neck, now her throat's all gone
Lookin like a fuckin monster from the Twilight Zone
Then they wonder why I stay at Travis' pad with a backpack
for the whole week, full of plastic-wrapped black tees
and deodorant like his house is my home
I could live with the same hat
And the same flat-screen TV watchin Flapjack
And the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday
where I skate with the same fuckin friends that
didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh
"Message from the GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat"
E-mail full of e-mails, I never write back
Ain't kill myself yet, and I already want my life back

[Chorus]

[Tyler, the Creator]
One shot, two shots, one gun, two cops
I'm blowin them flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers
You on the side of faggots and cock blockers
I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches
I'm +Barney+, +Dinosaur+ Harley of a human
Cause I'm shroomin with the bangers and the carneys
You niggaz can't harm me cause y'all know that
we at the fuckin Dirty like it's laundry {Tyler, calm down}
Nigga, get off me {Calm down, man}
Fuck off me man, fuck {what's gotten into you?}
I don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times
Sometimes I'm fuckin mad, sometimes I'm not {yeah, you...}
As though I got a fuckin voice in my head
Tellin me to do all this fucked up shit, man {yeah, what's this?}
I don't fuckin know, man {what's this person named then, Tyler, huh?}
He tells me to do this shit, that I don't wanna fuckin do
{What's his name?} Tron Cat</pre>
