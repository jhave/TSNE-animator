[Chorus 2X: Gucci Mane] + (Lil Scrappy)
I rob in my black tee
Hit licks in my black tee
All in ya house searchin for bricks in my black tee (Crank it)
I kill in my black tee
I steal in my black tee
I'm real so I gotta keep it trill in my black tee (O-kay-kay-kay)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
You can catch me all in a nigga house wit a black tee
Gucci Mane, lil flair got a million dollar mouthpiece
Black Tee, black rag, even got a black mask
Leavin out ya house, thirty pounds in my book bag
Black 'llac, black back, fin' to hit a lick again
You a head bussa punch yo hand wit yo fist den
Franchise hate me, probly wanna kill me
Remixed it wit Scrappy and now the hood feel me
Fresh on the scene wit the all black shirt
Gucci so gutta he'll steal money out ya purse
I lay up in ya yard, rob ya when ya go to church
Ya love white tees now ya face on the shirt
Black tee, black reed, trappin on the front street
Got a black pistol grip pump on the seat
Black tee, O.G., nigga don't approach me
Bubble gum wappin ass niggaz can't smoke me

[Chrous]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
It's Bun B in his black tee &amp; G in his black tee
Reppin UGK and BAT in his black tee
Pimp in his black tee, mack in his black tee
Free Pimp C on the back of his black tee
Gucci chain swangin on the front of his black tee
Cadillac swangin, smokin blunts in his black tee
Stunt in his black tee, ball in his black tee
It ain't jus me pimpin we all got a black tee

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
And I got a 1-2 Bun
Got 36 O's for the 2-1
Jeezy bout them green guys
Got H-town goin for the ten or five
I'm talkin cornflakes
Black inner tubes wrapped in black duck tape
Say it again dawg to make sure that ya heard me
Got my four-x black tee up under my jersey

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
I got the all black Chevy on all black rims
Keep a small black gat in my all black Tims
On the all-black leather there's a all-black mack
Tryin to snatch get ya black ass blowed the fuck back
44 to ya torso 4 in ya hat
Kick doja to ya house and put it to a cataract
Gorillas wit banana clips goin monkey in the back
They'll put yo ass in that black box, laid out flat

[Verse 5: Jody Breeze]
Look I slang in my white but I bang in my black tee
Gucci on the front, Jody Breeze on the back street
Chillin by a black Cadillac on sum black feet
Scrappy in a Chevy watchin Scarface on the flat screen
Told y'all constantly, ride wit the pump wit me
Yup in my black tee, wit the nine underneath
I ain't gotta keep tellin y'all niggaz I'm a G
I'ma just cock back and leave sum blood on ya teeth

[Chorus]

[Verse 6: 4-Tre]
I'm so stainless in my black tee
Remainin in my black tee
On the grind cause I like to shine in my black tee
Diamond glistenin cross plus the background is a black tee
Thieve then come back sprayin rounds in my black tee
4-Tre, I want war in my black tee
Fuck them, they probly neva wore a black tee
Workin in my black tee, smokin purple in my black tee
I'm lookin for twelve all out yo curtain in my black tee

[Verse 7: Lil Scrappy]
Fuck a white tee, I got my black tee and vest on
Fuck a sturdy shot, I'm goin straight for the bread home
I don't know why y'all niggaz dropped move B
Cause now Raheem'll show ya punk ass a tree
Bust nuts in my black tee, sluts in my black tee
Now I'm smokin nothin but blunts in my black tee
See me in Valve then tried to fight me
Jus the same monkey shawty don't take me lightly

[Chorus]</pre>
