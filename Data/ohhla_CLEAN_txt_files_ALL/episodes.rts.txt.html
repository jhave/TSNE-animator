[voice in background]
Yeah, you in tune to another episode in my area code
All sorts of episodes in my area code
Where the blocks explode, where the temperature is cold
It's just an episode in my area code
Another episode in my area code
All sorts of episodes in my area code
Where the blocks explode, ?? back and unload
I seen it unfold in my area code

[The Jazzyfatnastees]
Better believe it.. cause it is co-min..
You won't believe the site you see before your eyes..
You won't believe the site you see before your eyes..

[Verse One: Black Thought]
Just push the panic button on your remote control
Then enter the zone where our patrollers will get round cold soul
Diddly Bo leave her feelin a saga foretold
Who got caught 'pon the block for gold, got the old heads froze
They peepin outta closed windows
They not secure as they supposed I watched it all unfold
Witness another episode with titanic panoramic view
as this manic-depressin un-load with his gun hold
Wild like a son sold for cash
Guns traded for sensi and hash, crack for ass
Entire crews pass not makin the news flash
Brews pass a memory and spark not to blast
Whatever Ave. transform to the war path
Pure wrath from North down to 24th and Task
Game slaughter half, the niggas you were prayin with
Streets tainted with camouflage - guerilla sabotage
My cousin's Jarette and Todd, was livin type large
Got caught then blast crashed off on Broad and Lombard
So many so-called hearts scarred they buried in the yard
Lick shots at Babylon de one comfy bombard
Kids run far from traditional credit cards scams
Veterans is nipped in the butt with large plans
Stick up kids is jumpin outta plated Dodge Rams
to jam, you and your man it's mad drama and -

[Chorus: The Jazzyfatnastees + background voice]
Better believe it.. cause it is co-min..
You won't believe the site you see before your eyes..
You won't believe the site you see before your eyes..

[background voice]
Yo, the episodes to my area code
Just another episodes in my area code
Where the blocks explode, where the temperature is cold
It's just an episode in my area code
All sorts of episodes in my area code
Just another episode in my area code
Where the blocks explode, ?? back and unload
I seen it unfold in my area code, check it

[Verse Two: Dice Raw]
This is for all of my niggaz, that are R.I.P.'s
You ain't missin nothin, life ain't what it should be
I'll pass across soon, who know who's the enemy
Lots of shit has changed and it's kinda fucked up to see
You remember Tauseen nigga thick slice of dream
Go out fast for the buck do anything for the cream
Never seen a case like this, although it's quite contageous
He even got his little brother actin all outrageous
From dusk to dawn, and from dawn back to dusk
They do anything and everything, tryin to come up
It's kinda sickenin, how the cash is so fuckin addicted
And when I say son wild they say that that's conflicted
Ain't nothin but a contradiction in this world we live in
Cause the loot is for the takin, and not for the givin
Then the youngest one, will say "I'ma die hustlin
Fuck everybody except my brother who I'm trusted in"
I guess the young boy just did not know the truth
Cause the following week Tauseen threw him off the roof
And sometimes I wonder what the fuck I think about that
How nowadays kids get whacked for somethin less than a pat
But I guess that's how it goes when there ain't no more rap
Thought he was his brother's keeper, but fuck all that
Niggaz causin mayhem, from the P.M.'s to A.M.'s
America's worst nightmare -- guns in kids' hands

[Chorus: The Jazzyfatnastees + background voice]
Better believe it.. cause it is co-min..
You won't believe the site you see before your eyes..
You won't believe the site you see before your eyes..

.. in my area code
It's another episode in my area code
Where the blocks explode, ?? back and unload
I seen it unfold in my area code
Just another episode in my area code
All sorts of episodes in my area code
Where the blocks explode, ?? back and unload
I seen it unfold in my area code, check it, yo

[Verse Three: Malik B]
It was the year of '84 I was tryin to get in the mix
The year when niggaz rolled with sheepskins gazelles and kicks
Even got the patent leather Adidas snatched off your feet
Man that talk is cheap the crippled can't walk for weeks
The first sto was word to Penn and Teller's
Strolled in the dollar house parties; in search for Cinderella
Was just a little man real bold
Tryin to act grown and old so the respect'll be shown
A hip-hop a little pop and the breakdancin
When niggaz wore windbreakers plot to take lambskins
Remember Zigglers?  Uptown the bottom's not quite the same
St. Charles in South Phil the ooh mob gang
H-R-M Ogontz Ave. Brickyard to hollow
Niggaz was snatchin gazzeles and flippin pockets for the dallo
You wore your little wolf chain in West Oak Lane
And niggaz from Logan came to extort we know the game
You proclaim this gangster bullshit talk
And never even seen your man shot, or bodies in chalk
Aggravated assualt another weekend in the precinct
Takin everybody for their ring man that's how we think
Back then you catch a suckerpunch off guard
Niggaz will pull your card, tryin to walk around all hard
Niggaz quick to flip your pockets if you lip service
When you see fifteen niggaz deep - with scully's get nervous
It ain't no tellin what they could do to you
So you clutch up, thinkin and knowin you gettin stuck up
in another episode in my area code, episode in my area code

[Chorus: The Jazzyfatnastees + background voice]
Better believe it.. cause it is co-min..
You won't believe the site you see before your eyes..
You won't believe the site you see before your eyes..

[background voice over last line of Verse Three onward]
