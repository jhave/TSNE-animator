Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You know what it is when I do this
Come through I have these niggas asking what a roof is
Call the camera man tell him hurry we can shoot this
40 on the ceiling swear to god don't make me shoot this

Yeah, how you want it, hard or soft, get 'em in, get 'em all
AR flat screens in the front room
Quarter bricks half things in the back room (yeaaaah)
How you want it, hard or soft, get 'em in, get 'em all
AR flat screens in the front room
Quarter bricks half things in the back room

It's ovah. The real back
You niggas ain't running shit they can kill that
Kill that, yeah, funeral home
Take the brick got the casket yeah funeral home
How you want it, the more the merrier
Long shit been touched like the virgin mary
Got that bullshit step, it's been stepped on
If you people show you that then they dead wrong
Call the niggas up, get your money back
Come holla at yo boy, get this cadillac
In and out the back door, lock the dead bolt
bout to flood the whole block, need a sail boat

How you want it, hard or soft, get 'em in, get 'em all
AR flat screens in the front room
Quarter bricks half things in the back room (yeaaaah)
How you want it, hard or soft, get 'em in, get 'em all
AR flat screens in the front room
Quarter bricks half things in the back room

Cut the air condition on set the microwave
Chance to make it out slimmer than some micro-braids
How you want it it's on the stove nah
When you want it, it's one the road nah
Glade plugins - whole house stink...
fans run up in here, the whole house faint
Passed out countin' twenties, wake me up please
Running water in the kitchen, need some jet skis
Take the fork in the water, that's a water spoke
Y'all know I'm bullshitting, that's my water joke
You know this shit funny you can laugh nigga
It's all with that search warrant that's yo ass nigga

How you want it, hard or soft, get 'em in, get 'em all
AR flat screens in the front room
Quarter bricks half things in the back room (yeaaaah)
How you want it, hard or soft, get 'em in, get 'em all
AR flat screens in the front room
Quarter bricks half things in the back room

Money coming, money going
Serve my out of town niggas yeah that money foreign
Serve those latin niggas servin that [?]
We don't play them type of game, yeah nintendo
Y'all don't give a fuck weigh it on your iPad
If it's anything over then it's my bad
2005 2008 that's a new pair of Js another thousand straight
You know it's jumping out the [?] nigga come go
Coming back stupid big I'm talking dumbo
tell em meet me at the honeycomb hideout
bumblebee lambo. honeycomb ride out

How you want it, hard or soft, get 'em in, get 'em all
AR flat screens in the front room
Quarter bricks half things in the back room (yeaaaah)
How you want it, hard or soft, get 'em in, get 'em all
AR flat screens in the front room
Quarter bricks half things in the back room</pre>
