[Chorus x2]
I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood
I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood
I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood
Somebody say you was looking for me, I'm in the hood

[Brisco]
I be posted on the corner, twistin that good
I got that all black dickie on, I'm keepin it hood
What it is? I'm the Opa Locka goon
Got work in the trap, and the Chevy droppin soon
See, Cash Money rubberbands 'em, bands 'em
Since I got the deal, girls sayin he so handsome
I'ma Dade County, Yorker boy
I earn stripes, I got soldiers that'll flop you for it
Now I'm bouncin with a hood rat
She think I love her, but I use her for her food stamps
It's the ghetto, it's whateva, you cook it, I'll shoot it
And don't worry about them smokers, we keepin it movin (so we keepin it movin)
I know Cubans that knows O's
If I ask for it, they send it by the boat load
Weezy Wee, I think it's a wrap
And if you need me, you know where to find me at
I'm in the hood

[Chorus x2]

[Lil Wayne]
Uptown New Orleans, like always
Cash Money boy, shine like bald heads
Big Bezel make my watch look like a hog head
And all I do is smoke trees, call me a log head
I'm butter on the break like Parkay
And I am all about me like Doe Ray
I'm in the hood, I'm the hood like dope, yay
Nappy ass hair like Buckweed, otay
Hollygrove, Ether St. be my damn hood
Where you can murdered for free like can goods
I got 12 barbaros under the lamb hood
I can bring a Kentucky Derby to the damn hood
Sunshine diamonds help me tan good
And I'll let it blow like a band wood
I'll call Brisco, I'm on South Beach
30 minutes later, Opa Locka is where I'll be

[Chorus x2]

[Brisco]
Like Kroger cups, watered juice, pickled eggs, and pig feet
If you got beef, you know just where to find me
I'm in the hood, or better yet, the projects
Where baby mama's trippin, and them goons livin heartless
3 rules, get money, don't tell
And if that welfare check come late, raise hell
I'ma poor boy, I ain't got shit
And I hope they don't tell Baby, I'ma hit me a lick

[Lil Wayne]
Man, I'm so Hollygrove
Stand strong in that water like a commodor
Black holes in yo white tee, dominoes
Me and Brisco, Cash Money carnivores
I am New Orleans like carnival
And in the hood, call me Weezy the Honorable
These other rappers so ironicle
And if I ain't in the mansion, then I'm up in the Phantom or...

[Chorus x4]</pre>
