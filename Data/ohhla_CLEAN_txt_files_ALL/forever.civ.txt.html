Typed by: Cno Evil

To honor the world's greatest entertainer
The most succesful recording artist
In the history, of popular music, Michael Jackson

[Intro: Cilvaringz]
Yeah, come on, keep it real for the people, come on
Yeah, yo, I show my love back to you, back to you

[Chorus: Cilvaringz]
If you feeling me, show your love and respect
For the king of MTV, just please
Don't confuse any tabloid junkie, with his history

[Cilvaringz]
Yo, I was five when I seen him live, doing his Motown
Twenty five anniversary live showdown
He was hip hop, way before hip hop
In '84 thuggin' it, way before Pac, "Beat It"
And not yet, to see anyone, do what he did
And he lit up the fire in me to be this
Artist, that I am today
So to M.J., I show my love, respect, race and
God given talent, I always loved your ballads
Had me running to the store, spending my allowance
You stayed peaceful, media stay wilding
A bunch of money hungry fuckas trying to get you down and
God will punish 'em, Mike, you gotta represent
And never let, shit like this, be definite
It's evident, to the dumb, deaf and blind
Michael Jackson, greatest entertainer of all time

[Chorus: Cilvaringz]
If you feeling me, show your love and respect
For the king of MTV, just please
Don't confuse any tabloid junkie, with his history
You read, but what you read, is so false
And it's not reality, it's me
Show your love to the man, spin around and go "hee-hee"

[Cilvaringz]
Gone too soon, gone too soon
Mike, they want you gone too soon, but fuck it
Can't get no love from the tabloid junkies
And the Bubbles you speak, ain't Crystal, the monkey
From all the money, you, generously gave, Mike
To the wonderful, dances on stage, Mike
From the glove to the hat, plus the shiny jacket
The mystery and history, yeah, they might be laughing
They might be talking shit, but you be moonwalking hits
King of pop, no corporate shit
That's a black man, own the half of ATV
That's a black man, who got ya'll on MTV
That's a, black man, who did it five times diamond
He's a rich black man, who never rocked a diamond
Yes, sir, when it's down and prime
Michael Jackson, greatest entertainer of all time, come on

[Chorus]

[sample]
I'm so happy to be here tonight
Cuz I get the privelage of bringing up
A man that I grew up on, that I imitate, you see me imitating
This is the man, the greatest entertainer that ever lived
Give it up for the King of Pop, Michael Jackson

[Chorus]</pre>
