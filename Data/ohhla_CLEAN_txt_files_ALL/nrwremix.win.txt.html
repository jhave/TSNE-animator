[Intro - P. Diddy] (Mario Winans)
I like this right here
(I just need to talk to you for a second)
Mario Winans (It won't take me long)
This Bad Boy baby! (I gotta get this off my chest)
Hey yo Lil' Flip! Talk to em!

[Verse - Lil' Flip] (P. Diddy)
Uh! Half the time I'm on the grind
Now you wanna play wit my mind
You wonder why we never spending time
Don't you know I get paid to rhyme?
I took you out the hood and I laced you up
Now you a Cover Girl, I had to make you up
You moved in my crib and I caked you up
It's been a long time coming, I'm a wake you up
When I ain't wit you I'm clocking dough
Not popping Moe' wit a flock of hoes
Don't beat around the bush, just let me know
But deep down you don't wanna let me go
Uh! You know the kid got chicks for days
I push spliffs of haze, and my whips on blades!
But I ain't trying to break your heart
You just gotta learn to play your part
(Hey yo 'Rio, talk to em)

[Verse - Mario Winans]
I'm really glad that you can take out time
Cause I got a lot on my mind
I never thought that you would be the kind
To do the dirt and hang you head
Babygirl won't you make me understand
Why you would say the things you said to me
You made me believe, we would be forever
But it was all a lie!

[Chorus - Mario Winans]
If it never really was what you seen in me
Why did you say you believed in me?
It's all because of you my security
It's driving me crazy baby
If it never really was what you had for me
Why did you say that you wanted me, needed me?
If it never really was what you meant for me, tell me

[Verse - Mario Winans]
Now I know I've asked you time and time again
Were you sure you didn't want another man?
I would of understood it back then
But you had to wait until I gave in
Now I know I've been a sucker for your love
Baby tell me what the hell was I thinking of?
I should of listened to them when they told me
But I learned the hard way!

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Mario Winans] (2x)
Why would you play with my heart?
When I gave it all
It's tearing me apart girl
All you had to do is so say
I would of let you go
You're making it so hard girl

Tell me why why baby!!

[Chorus]

[Chorus - Mario Winans] (Tierra "T Baby" Brown)
If it never really was what you seen in me
Why did you say you believed in me
(I just tried to give you what you needed)
It's all because of you my security
It's driving me crazy baby
(Would you just tell me why you lied to me)
If it never really was what you had for me
Why did you say that you wanted me
(What am I to do?) needed me? (I will leave you)
If it never really was what you ment for me, tell me
