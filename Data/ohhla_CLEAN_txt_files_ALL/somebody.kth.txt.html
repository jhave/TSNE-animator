Typed by: obi1one@hotmail.com

I need a blunt 'fore I slap the shit outta somebody
Uhh, c'mon , get it up y'all
Uhh, c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon , get it up y'all
Uhh, yeah yeah , uhh, I know y'all like this one
Uhh, uhh, yeah, yeah, uhh, c'mon

[Keith Murray]
Yo y'all niggas will never see my level
Rap so hot I slap box with the devil
Tap a jaw, slap a bitch do what I like
Got a sociology and money like Reverend Ike
Yo here's your rap eviction , get out the jurisdiction
Before I hit that ass with a cross a diction crucifixion
Editorial, news flash, extra, extra
Let this blast wit yo stank ass
Face the ultimate challenge, style's got alot of knowledge
Come in violence, leave in silence
This beat's a b, so come on take a swim
MC's cant float don't worry about them
I'ma dupe like Patty, rich like maddie
Slick like a caddy, but not your baby daddie
Girls I got em locked, flavors come assorted
So pop that koochie girl I can double joint it

CHORUS
This is for the thugs in the clubs and the hotties in the party
Who need a drink before you (Slap somebody)
All my cats on the corner who's packed in the shottie
Who need a blunt before you (Slap somebody)
Rewind this jam and let it rock the party before, I
Slap somebody
I speak with more technique than karate cuz I, will
Slap somebody

[Keith Murray]
Ayo I'm strictly from the street, that's why I get love
Airin dearin niggas out in the back of the club
With the mic in my hand, just got paid
Take these suckers out till I get on stage
When the girls see my face and they all get excited
Dogs in the front row bout to start a riot
Too loud to be quiet, too wired to be tired
Yo E crank this shit up and get it started
Get the crowd funky like the whole place farted
MC's rest in peace like dearly departed
Then it's all in togehther now, let me show you how
I do it rock n roll style, and dive in the crowd
Murray aint the average MC, I got alotta things
But don't act conceited when you see me on the street
I hang with the rich, keep it real with the poor
Kick hard metaphor, cuz that's what I'm here for
Catch me east of the sun or west of the moon
Lookin butterfly like a caterpillar just cocooned
Smooth like Thug Passion over the rocks
So sporty they need to put me on a Wheaties box

CHORUS

[Keith Murray]
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today
In a special way to play on baby play
The way you shake that ass girl is somethin drastic
Fabulous , and fantastic
Fly like a B-52 hot stepper
Got Latinos yellin, "Wepa, ese loco, da le toto
Pese mi culo, pape chulo"
Whatever, the more the merrier, the longer the weave the scarier
My squad is Def and we aint hearin ya
B.E., to think quick with the speed of a cheetah
Strip down to my wife beater
Baby doll shake what you got, I'm not a playa hater, I just dis alot
And don't slam the doors of the Mazzarati
Because I, will, slap somebody

CHORUS

Bring me up somethin nice, cool to drink in this bitch before I
Slap somebody
Fix me somethin hot to eat before I have to go outside and
Slap somebody
Throw your hands in the sir from side to side before I
Slap somebody

FADE OUT</pre>
