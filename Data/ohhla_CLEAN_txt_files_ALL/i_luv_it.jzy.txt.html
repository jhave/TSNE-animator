[Intro]
Ride till I die, Lord knows stay high, and I love it
Let's go!

[Chorus]
We count hundreds on the table, twentys on the floor
Fresh outta work and on the way with some more
And I love it (yeah!), and I love it
I got gangstas in the crowd, bad bitches at my show
Parked outside, and sitting on vogues
And I love it (yeah!), and love it

[Verse 1]
Once again it's on, I'm back in the motherfucking booth
These niggaz still lying, I'm the motherfucking truth (YEEEEEAHHH!)
I don't believe I need some more fucking proof
I ain't want the four door, I copped the motherfucking coupe (HAHA!)
They tryin be me, I'm just tryin be G
And everything comes to 'em like you'll see
These niggaz in the dark baby I'll just shine (SHINE)
I do it from the heart homie they just rhyme (YEEEEEAHHHH!)
Check your watch nigga it's my time (HEY!)
Mind made up I was on my grind (THAT'S RIGHT!))
So pay attention yea you on my time
In that case time waits for no man
Do it again I done that before man (GYEAH!)
M.O.E., he ain't part of the program
Or maybe you niggaz ain't listening
Open your eyes I'm a blessing in disguise

[Chorus]

Yea I blew up, but they like that
They switched up on me, and I ain't like that
Sold my first brick yea, I came right back
Fast forward the tape, nigga look at me now
And I never turn back, so motherfuck that
Life is on the ground got my head to the sky
Smoked all day, Lord knows I stay high
Stay on top, Lord knows I'm gon' try
And live for the moment, Lord knows I'm gon' die
And when I get to hell, Lord knows I'm gon' fry
Woke up this morning so I'm still alive
36 O's I sold them all for five

[Chorus]

Been around the world, it's the same ol' caine
Been around the world, it's the same ol' thang (Dro)
All the real niggaz either dead or in jail
And if you're looking for me homie, I'm in the A-T-L
You gotta play it how it go, you can't cheat on life (YEAAAAH!)
Ya better drink a Red Bull, you can't sleep on life
I ain't tryna do you, I'm tryin' do me
Last album did two, I'm just tryin' do three
Fresh out the block yea the work was hard
Ride with the top down so I'm closer to God
My P.O. telling me I need a 9 to 5
But I already got a job, and that's stayin alive

[Chorus]
