[Intro]
Take how you want it
Take, take it how you take it
Take, take it how you want it
Nigga, nigga...

[Ray Cash]
Shall I speak on my niggaz behalf
You niggaz want drama, I'ma get off in yo ass
How you love that, easy come, easy go
Oh you want me to flow, so you stressing the raw
Yeah thats what you looking for
See all my niggaz know is pain, put me in the street
And you see all I know is gain, why, yall niggaz is lame
I only fuck with dogs, cross me now you see my niggaz is raw
You fucking with a god, see I got nothing to lose, but you go all out
See you got something to prove, ooh I ain't fuckin with you
So if I do a show, and get the crowd hype and you ain't got my dough
I'ma up pipe, so now you know the deal, now you know whats real
Shit I spit is ill, I know my niggaz kill, but you can..

[Chorus] x2
Take how you want it
Take, take it how you take it
Take, take it how you want it fucka
However you want it man


[Ray Cash]
For dollars I would send you for a ? to get Excursion with Eddie Baur
? Impallas and problems plus my gun will show my power
Picture me rollin', heavy Chevy oh no it ain't stolen
And plus this dick that I'm holdin got these hos wide open
Stick my finga up to the world, hold em to my scrotem
Niggaz think I ain't gonna rep, well I guess I gotta show em
You gotta know when to hold em', gotta know when to fold em'
You gotta know when to pay em, prasie em, play em or blow em
You gotta know when to drop you a nigga or chop you a nigga
Say fuck hip-hop and flip-flops you a nigga
I'm dope, you cook me up I'm rockin it nigga
I'm A-1 Ivory put stock in me nigga, but you could..

[Chorus]

[Ray Cash]
I've been poppin my collar, since poppin a collar been popular
Cuz I'm fresh to death and popular dont mean I wont pop at ya
I know niggaz who run and hide, boys who bust shots at ya
Choose your side of the field, you pick mine I'm gonna ride with ya
Last beef I had, really couldnt bust a nigga head
I just signed my papers, Manolo went to get my bread
I know this gonna be heard by the police and the feds
But I'm gonna kill that mothafucka you tell em what I said
Cuz he could..

[Chorus]

[Ray Cash]
What my niggaz want?
Hos!
What my niggaz need?
Dough!
What my niggaz love? (what)
Hennesy and weed! (yeah, yeah)
What my niggaz want?
Hos!
What my niggaz need?
Dough!
What my niggaz love? (what)
Hennesy and weed! (yeeeah)
