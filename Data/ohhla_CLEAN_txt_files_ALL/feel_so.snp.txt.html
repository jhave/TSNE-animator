(Snoop Dogg) [Talking]
Eastside 
Yeah 
Fell good we got homeboyz out there that look out for 
That's on the real
I mean the real homeboy it's hard to come by now days
Ya know what I'm saying 
That's real

(Snoop Dogg)
Joy and pain 
Pain and joy
I'm trying to do right and united the homeboyz
Eastside rip ride
When we dippin' ? ?
We do it to ya in this side 
That's right 
That's' how we do it in the L-B-C
All we know is that "G" and we 
Trying to get somewhere 
I gotta get somewhere
I can't fail (Why)
Nigga ain't made for jail
I remember when I had a million dolla bail
On my head
Left a nigga straight fo' dead
Fuck a Fed
My homeboy Tray Dee once said:
"You gotta crackin' with this rappin'
Nigga, take it to the head"
I'mma mash for mine
Down for the grind 
I got to get my hands on some paper times mine
Specially with the homies on mash with me
I'm independent in a minute 
Nigga come get me
Yeah!.

(Chorus)
It's all good in our hood 
Happens so damn good right
You always give some back and that's a fact
It's all good in our hood 
Happens so damn good right
You always give some back and that's a fact
And havin' a rider on your side.


(Swoop G)[overlapping the last line of the chorus]
I'm outspoken 
My language is broken into a slang 
Just expressing 
Thirty eight choice of my weapon
I say I die for under oath 
Niggas will take you for your bread 
Man! The whole loaf
Everything in a twist 
Where everybody trying to get rich
The hardest nigga, the first one go out bitch
Hustlin' for survival
Scoop my 5.0
Book'em, down on nigga start sayin'
Somebody got my back
I don't know who
'Cause run like he kick it 
I don't know you 
Player haters, every minute wanna ride with D
Every other minute wanna diss my clique
Ya'll niggas gotta raise up the ? ?
Runnin' round town lyin' bout you seen us
Is a trip, it don't stop and I wish it would 
Long as I'm chipped up 
It's all good
I got my back.

(Chorus)
It's all good in our hood 
Happens so damn good right
You always give some back and that's a fact
It's all good in our hood 
Happens so damn good right
You always give some back and that's a fact
And havin' a rider on your side

(Lil' C-Style) [overlapping the last line of the chorus]
I always got strach with hustle 
Like a Mack 
Khakis in my legs, T-shirts and some quarter sacks
Representin' Eastside to the fullest 
And keep me a pistol and won't hesitate to use it
Fools! I'm just tryin' to make music
Keep on movin' 
Buy me a yatch and keep crusin' 
Dippin' in my north star Cadi' Seville 
Makin' corner in the hood and still keep it real
Jumpin' out shootin' dice ain't no big ass deal
I got a deal 
So you know 
I got money to spill
Lil' Style is my name but call me Dolla bill
Wit a whole lotta money now that's gangster 
So keep it real 
So when you see me up in traffic 
Holdin' a heater on my lap and will blasted
R.I.P. to all my homiez in the caskets 
Having to ride outta your side in fantastic.

(Chorus)
It's all good in our hood 
Happens so damn good right
You always give some back and that's a fact
It's all good in our hood 
Happens so damn good right
You always give some back and that's a fact
And havin' a rider on your side.

(Crooked I) [overlapping the last line of the chorus]
Hey speakin' a rhyme or two 
That's what the hell I do
You player hatin' Crooked I nigga
Hold up
"W" get throw up when I role up
And the ho's that stroll up
Get the ho's that I ??
So what's the hold up 
Since I showed up I sew up: the game
With the flow bucket 
So rough show none 
So miss me with that ra ra
I'm just tryin' hit some na na 
Like her name was stack La La
But sho don't 
Ya'll don't know we makin' that paper pal
How!
With Tha Eastsidaz and Bow Wow
Really now!
You and "G" 
French braids and grimm
Makin' all the ho's saying:
"We like busting him"
Back in the West we life dangerest
Everybody was raised up gangsterish
We still sip on gnach, chip crystal
Make money and get back
Yeah we too tight for that.

(Chorus) [Women Voice]
It's all good in our hood 
Happens so damn good right
You always give some back and that's a fact [And that's a fact]
It's all good in our hood 
Happens so damn good right
You always give some back and that's a fact
And havin' a rider on your side. [Havin' a rider on your side]

[Women Voice]
It's all good, so good
Somebody got your back.
Yeah!</pre>
