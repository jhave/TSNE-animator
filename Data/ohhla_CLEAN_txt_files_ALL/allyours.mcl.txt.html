Song:   It's All Yours
Typed by: www.MC-Lyte.com

Our love is old-school like Mary Jane's
Boston baked beans and candy canes
Exchange a look on the number two train
Run catch kiss sunshine or rain
Jackson 5, good times the Jefferson's
Yeah Baby, you know I liked it better when
You lived closer, but then you moved
But that couldn't stop our groove
My magic-man, my Brooklyn-boy wonder
I rub your shoulders if pressure you was under
Late night rides out to sunrise
Catch a flick or two and then back to Bedstuy
You in the bubble goose me in the sheep skin
Cold as hell back then it wasn't mattering
Long as we were hand in hand your my man I'm your girl
Ready to conquer the world

*Chorus* (Gina Thompson)

This is for all the years you've been
My companion as well as my best friend
So tonight Baby I'm giving you what you want
It's all yours

Our love is like a Romeo and Juliette flick
So surreal but yet picturesque
There were problems I can admit
But we handled it and still the candles lit
So glad that we didn't just jet
Cause now we reaping the benefits
Who would have thought?
The cute little boy from down the street
Would fall in love with me
It's like a number one dream come true
To have somebody you love, love you
And that's all that matters
Is that we grow together make sure we never shatter
You're the reason I live
Because I want you to get all that I got to give
Long as we're hand in hand you're my man I'm your girl
Ready to conquer the world

*Chorus*

Our love is mystical like galaxies you can't touch
Around the world and back again I love you that much
Our love is destiny like Bonnie and Clyde
We'll die of old age side by side
Throughout the days I remain truthful
I keep it tight for you sexy and youthful
I told my mom when our days are through
If you have to go first bury me next to you
What I feel is unexplainable, 'I love you'
Just ain't enough to say to you
You've been there from the beginning to the end
My companion as well as my best friend
You got my heart now, here's my life
Yes I'm ready to be your wife
From here one know that you're the one

Everything you want it's done

*Chorus*</pre>
