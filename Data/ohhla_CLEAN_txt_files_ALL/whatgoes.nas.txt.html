Yeah.. aiyyo it's poison

[Chorus]
Ecstasy, coke - you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin us medicine - which is poison
Doctors injectin our infants - with the poison

[Verse One]
Religion misoverstood is poison
Niggaz up in my hood be gettin shot - given poison
In hospitals, shots riddle the block
Little, children and elderly women run for they lives
Drizzlin rain come out the sky every time somebody dies
Must be out my fuckin mind, what is this, the hundreth time?
Sendin flowers to funerals, readin rest in peace
You know the usual, death comes in threes
Life is short is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life - by how one lives and what he did
And funny how these black killer companies is makin money off us
Fast food, cola, soda, Skull &amp; Bone crosses, it's all poison

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Religion misoverstood is poison
Sisters up in my hood try to do good given choices
When pregnant, drop out of school or have abortions
Stop workin hopin that they find a man that will support them
Up late night, on they mother's cordless
Thinkin a perm or bleach and cream will make them better when they gorgeous
White girls tannin, lyposuction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips that's life destruction
Light-skinned women, bi-racial hateful toward themselves
Denyin even they blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods but I, overstand the mental poison
That's even worser than drugs - yo it's poison

[Chorus]

[Nas]
Religion misoverstood is poison
Radio and TV poison, white Jesus poison
And any thoughts of takin me down is poison
Who want beef now, my heat shall annoint them, plaow

[Interlude]
Never to worry
All the wrong doers got it coming back to 'em a thousand times over
Every dog has it's day, and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it comin back to 'em
Everybody reaps what they sews, that's how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken, it may get worse but we'll get through it
Y'all, be strong

[Verse Three]
The China-men built the railroad, the Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return the Pilgrim killed 'em
They call it it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday hell-day
Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggaz share gifts, e'ryday like Christmas
Slay bitches, and party e'ryday like this is the last
I'm with my heckles, connectin and we hittin the lab
This is my level, fuck if it get you mad
It's all poison, all of my words to enemies it is poison
Rappers only talk about ki's, it's all poison
How could you call yourself MC's?  You ain't poison
Think about the kids you mislead, with the poison
And any thoughts of taking me down is all poison
Who want beef now, my heat shall annoint them, plaow

[Hook]
What goes around comes around my nigga
And what goes up it must come down my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground my nigga
Just hold it down we older now my nigga
What goes around comes around my nigga
And what goes up it must come down my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground my nigga
Just hold it down we older now my nigga

[Verse Four]
This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey, light-skinned with herpes
Fuckin sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C.
This is the problem cause he never tell 'em he got it
from lettin fags suck him off, Rikers Island in nine-three
Drives a Benz, hangs at all the parties, all the concerts
Backstage where the stars be, rockin they shirts
in bitches faces like clockwork - what's your name, where you from?
Chain blingin, thinkin girls everywhere is dumb
Takin pride in ruinin they lives
So they could never have babies, and they could never be wives
He never used a condom, give him head he got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDS
I contemplate, believin in karma
Those on top could just break, and won't be eatin tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleepin on niggaz dreams, they leave
When that nigga blow, she the first bitch on her knees
Knowin dudes that's neglectin they seeds
Instead of takin care of 'em they spendin money on trees
I pray for you, deadbeat daddies
Cause when them kids get grown it's too late for you
Now you old and you gettin shitted on
It's all scientific, mystic, you know the Earth and the stars
Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas
What is destined shall be
George Bush killer 'til George Bush kills me
Much blessings be healthy, remember
