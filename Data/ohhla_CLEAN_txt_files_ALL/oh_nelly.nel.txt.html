[Nelly]
They said a country boy, came through and then - changed the game
If you what you got ain't hot then - check your flame
If what you spittin ain't hittin then - check your aim
Your record sales start to slip and then - Nelly to blame
Now who you know come through first time on the scene
No set-ups, no guest appearances in between
Fire like a nigga drinkin gasoline
I keep it hot, like my dirty down in New Orleans
The Rams won the Superbowl, bought myself a ring
Whether you sparkle or you bling, don't matter same thing
Thug drinkin mo', but Don the King
I'm gettin pissy, with Tissy, Missy and Irene
Real close friends that like to try things
Me and my dirties we like to buy things
Fuck around and give me a license to fly things
Look up in the sky and have a Nelly sighting, like

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Skurrrrt, oh! (Gon' break it down)
Oh Nelly! (Gon' change that game around)
And I bet (y'all really gon' hate him now)
Why don't you come ride with me?  Oooh-wee!

[Nelly]
First name Nelly, last name Nel
First letter C, last letter L
Six hundred fly by, what the hell?
V-12 full detail, sittin on Sprewell's
Who in?  Can't tell, too much tint
But why the radio so loud?  Too much spent
Never be a Bush man, too Bill Clint'
Both country boys, and if the head right, E.I.
Head for my residency, lovin my presidency
I do it like you never did see
Shady to them niggaz that's shadin me
Givin back to the ones that gave to me
Bought a Caddy for the man that created me (who?)
My daddy, call him Big Nelly (ooh!)
Pimp juice flowin through that bloodline cuz
Huh, see what it does?  Yeah, you feel the buzz, like

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
One mo' time!  N, E, dash L-L-Y
If you didn't like me then, gon' hate me now
Me and Murph' fogged out in the buggy I
With the, suction doors, two bad-ass whores
Holla at Yo, cause I need that custom made
Waves, fresh fade, brand new Band-Aid
Skurrrt, them boys ain't playin around
unless it's in to watch shorty (?) face hopscotch
Never tic-tac-toe, there's too many of those
I need a Rocky Dennis face - uhh, knowhatImean?
Then I'm good to roll; hey, out of control
New motto - never fuck the same hoe!
Tryin to catch Wilt, four more to go
From the bed to the flo', jackrabbit too pro
Knock 'em out, wake baby girl to let her know
Yo - you can't even stay here tonight, f'real, I'm sorry

[Chorus]

[Nelly - still talking over Chorus]
Y'know, cuz, my security they gon' be knockin on the door in a minute
and, if you ain't out ma it's, it's it's gon' be violence
Um, yeah, f'sure, nothin personal, fo'sho'

[Interlude]
Uh uh, uh, you come ride with me
Uh, uh uh, uh you come ride with me
Skurrrrrt! Uh uh, uh, uh you come ride with me
Uh uh, uh, uh, uh uh

[Chorus] - 1/2X</pre>
