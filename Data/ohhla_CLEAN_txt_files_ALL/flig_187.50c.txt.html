[Intro]
From the day you're born, 'til the day you die...
If you're one of the poor ones you just gotta work hard

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider

[50 Cent]
They puttin pressure on me son now they want me to snap
End up like X and Whitney in my mansion smokin crack
I'm paranoid, I'm feelin like niggaz is tryin to get me
Forget the kids I'm shavin off my fuckin head like Britney
Man Dre won't mix my records now I need to talk to Jimmy
I'm fallin back in my old ways I'm ridin with the semi
Who's callin me? It's Chris he's on the other line with Diddy
But I don't wanna talk right now, my day is goin shitty
Why's Jay rockin that Urkel look, man isn't he from Marcy?
They say he's growin dreads and now he's talkin like a Yardi
Man everything is changin, I don't understand a thing
I guess this is that bullshit that all the money brings
I'm on flight

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
My baby mama boyfriend like to talk like he can hurt me
I'm laughin cause she kissed him in his mouth and gave him herpes
That just makes him one of 50 niggaz wantin to murk me
Niggaz found my truck and burnt it up out there in Jersey
You can ask my son, he'll tell you "My dad's fuckin crazy
She filled his head with shit and now I think he fuckin hates me"
Shady didn't invent me but a star is what he made me
I'll blow your fuckin mind out if I told you what he paid me
He gave me all the pills he had left, that's why I'm so high
It makes me feel so good now that I'm not so scared to die
I wish a nigga would, I dare a motherfucker try
You get at me and miss you kiss yo' black ass good-bye
I'm on flight

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
My lawyers all contained cause every month I give 'em stacks
In case they wanna send me up for murder like Max
Man I wasn't the shooter, I was never on the scene
So if they do forensics they'll find out it wasn't me
There's no need for a lie detector, I ain't sayin shit
The more you talk the higher chances you're doin a bid
Today I read the paper, it said Tru Life caught a case
They said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face
I spoke to Michael Vick, I told him I'm happy he home
You tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on
When dogs are fightin in the hood nobody gives a fuck
So you get back and shake it on the field, show them what's up
I'm on flight

[Chorus]</pre>
