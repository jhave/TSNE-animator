[Chorus]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)

[Big Boi]
Sir Luscious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlo's
and El Dorados; I'm wakin up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print?
Teddy Pender-grass cooler than Freddie Jackson
sippin a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U.
We blew hay too, ath-letes might cake you
but you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make
Cause

[Chorus]

[Big Boi]
Canary yellow seven-nine Seville is on display
My nigga - Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' - dip my rims today
So a nigga can - ride out to the Honeycomb - Hideout
I'ma show you how to - wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snipples
YKK on yo' zipper, lick you like a - lizard when I'm slizzard
or sober; six million ways to fold ya
Like Noah's, I get two's of youse and you get pretty 'D'
But I'll call yo' ass round eight-ish I know you'll be there for me
Girl

[Chorus]

[Andre 3000]
Those huge baby eyes, get to runnin off at they mouth
and tellin me everything that's on yo' nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned in need of vitamin D
and invitin me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, love who you ain't; you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk
in double time the boy next do's a freak, ha ha!

[Chorus]

[Hook: Andre 3000]
	(And we are...)
The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
	(And my my...)
The sky is fallin ain't no need to panic
	(But ooh ooh...)
I got a stick and want yo' automatic
	(Ooh ooh ooh...)
Compatible created in the attic

[repeat Hook]

[Chorus] - repeat to fade</pre>
