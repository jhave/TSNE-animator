Yeah
Come on come on come on
We still in this
Alright

You know thier aint no party like a kottonmouth party
Cuz a Kottonmouth Party dont Stop
Thier aint no need to fuss or fight
were all here as one everybody unite
Because the Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight
you know the Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight
Now we aint out to do nobody wrong
we just some stoners gettin by high playin our songs
The Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight
you know the Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight

You know Kottonmouth come through all blazed up
pants sag hat high rolled in our raised trucks
Not givin a fuck we sparkin pot on the curb
smokin on cigars but they really filled with herb
Some nice green fluffy shit that we got from 86
always got the bomb chronic always got the bomb hits
We took our last rips and headed to the back door
straight to the stealth bar V.I.P. second floor
i say capt N Coke you know its time to get loose
DJ B Spinin' Snoop Dog Gin and Juice
and i was smokin on some indo
chillin in the corner straight mackin on a hoe
yeah she look good and she was good to go
so we hooked em up and we took em home
The girl had a twin it was the craziest shit
The party bout to begin when we get to Loc's crib

Thier aint no need to fuss or fight
were all here as one everybody unite
Because the Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight
you know the Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight
Now we aint out to do nobody wrong
we just some stoners gettin by high playin our songs
The Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight
you know the Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight

Now its last call the bars closin down
We got the girls and we headed back to town
Jumped on the 101 South back to the 60
The land of the rocks pits 50's and 250's
Wood floors indoors got a track outback
The bottles of jack fill up the wine rack
Bongs packed ready to snap in every single room
Fridge full of alcoholic beverages to consume
Now all the girls is been gettin naughty
Welcome to a Kottonmouth Kings at the party
Its 4 in the morning and it just start to pop
had this girl on my jock jock jockin in this hots
Non stop red rock to the sun started rising
she was suprising sex fantasizing
Hills tall Ass raw and it dont quit
D-Loc and Richter on some Pimp shit

Thier aint no need to fuss or fight
were all here as one everybody unite
Because the Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight
you know the Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight
Now we aint out to do nobody wrong
we just some stoners gettin by high playin our songs
The Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight
you know the Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight

Yeah we in the house aint no doubt about it
drivin backed up shit they had to re-route it
Like that Fed-X package left 3 states back
Daddy-X samplin flavors like my name was Craig Mac
Whose packin new flavors in my pipe
X is smokin mad flavors tonight
Its a 1 night stand stickin up your town
were ganna fire it up and burn the whole place down
and if the cops come round try and shut us down
we pack pounds and move on to the next town
then the next town we get the whole seen poppin' in the next town
all the way from Cali to Boston

Thier aint no need to fuss or fight
were all here as one everybody unite
Because the Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight
you know the Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight
Now we aint out to do nobody wrong
we just some stoners gettin by high playin our songs
The Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight
you know the Kottonmouth Kings is in the house tonight</pre>
