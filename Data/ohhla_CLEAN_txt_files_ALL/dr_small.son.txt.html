Everyday all of my dreams come true
Why?
Cause I dream small

Everyday all of my dreams come true
Why?
Because I dream small

Everyday all of my dreams come true
Why?
Because I dream small

Everyday all of my dreams come true
Why?

I saw you today
Dream come true
You looked at me in that special way
Another dream come true
See it's so easy to do
It's so easy to be into you
Sometimes when were around each other we act awkward
Is it cause your not used to talking to nerds?
I know I'm usually only walking with words
But were talking everyday
You know I'm jocking you
Word
Before you react with amazement
Just pack it and blaze it
Couple of green teas
Couple of chairs
A double of green weed
A couple of stares
Crush a little bit of hash on their too
For that little crush I got on you
I wanna be on you
Like Ron Burgundy
Yellow hairs green purple and burgundy
On the inside though don't change a thing
I know that being with me might be a strange thing
Maybe its
Something In the air
When you picked up that flower by the trashcan
And put it in your hair
Yeah that was it right there
Stop acting like you don't wanna see me
You swear
I don't wanna lock you down be in control
I just wanna walk around the park
Hit a bowl
Catch a make out session
And then break out
Wondering if my breath was fresh when our lips locked
I got a new stereo in my bucket rocks some hip hop
Put my hands on your hips
Feel your hips rock feel your hips rock
Uhh or maybe
Not were both so ghetto
Lets take it slow so that their be no pressure
Let go to the store and get a swisher
You look cute with that sweatshirt
Or rugged t-shirt
Just play it cool and none of us will be hurt
I'll pull up to your house
Will blow a bag it's so high
I wont know how to act I'm not tripping
I'll see you tomorrow in fact
I'm a roll home knowing that

Everyday all of my dreams come true
Why?
Cause I dream small

Everyday all of my dreams come true
Why?
Because I dream small

Everyday all of my dreams come true
Why?
Because I dream small

Everyday all of my dreams come true
Why?
Because I dream small</pre>
