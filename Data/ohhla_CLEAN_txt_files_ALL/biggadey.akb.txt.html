[ VERSE 1 ]
It's like this y'all, to the beat y'all
A black man, I stand about six feet tall
And I'm a trooper y'all, a real trooper y'all
I can take a fall and bounce back like a super ball
Yo, my name is Akbar, check me out, I'm not far
You want your party rocked? Chill, I got you locked, paw
Soon as I hear the bass I'ma tear the place up
Then pick the pace up; you pick me? You picked the ace up
Yo, I'm ready for war, I've trained like a Jedi
In a b-boy stance I glance with my head high
You couldn't find a greater man alive
A shot from a .45 couldn't stop my vibe
No man can withstand or penetrate my aura
I step through Babylon, Sodom and Gomorrha
Armed with a verse I rehearsed from the Tora
The Holy Qu'ran, I tread upon troubled waters
Where the Tower of Babel's the Empire State
The Statue of Liberty's the harlet that fornicates
With the whole world causin my people to sin
Deaf, dumb and blind are possessed by evil djinn
Police state under pad locks and metal glocks
Where the fiends dream of rocks the size of ghetto blocks
And thugs got a tendency toward drug dependency
Smokin blunts endlessly, downin bottles of Hennessy
My peoples pour liquor in memory
Of the dead, when I'm gone I wonder how many will remember me
My peoples pour liquor in memory
Of the dead, when I'm gone I wonder how many will remember me

(I find myself alone)
(Nobody knows your name)
(When I die)
(The city lied)
(I find myself alone)

[ CHORUS ]
Yo, bigger they come, harder they fall
Quicker they run, sooner they done, Jah a-go lick them all
Bigger they come, harder they fall
Quicker they run, sooner they done, Jah a-go lick them all
Bigger they come, harder they fall
Quicker they run, sooner they done, Jah a-go lick them all
Will spare none, I fear none but the Most High
So run and tell Satan Hell's waiting close by

[ VERSE 2 ]
New World Order, manslaughter son and daughter
No food, clothing, shelter or running water
Police bought a car for the special task force
Now they got big rockets ready to blast off
How can I hide from the genocide?
Jah provide alternate routes to get me out
And escape, Babylon fake, no doubt
There's only one righteous path, you do the math
While you hold your breath waitin on the year 2000
The government's busy taking your public housing
Wages kept minimum, it's a new millennium
Replace your ghetto with condomeniums
I met Satan standin there waitin
On the corner of 138th and Adam Clayton
It was 2 o'clock at night when he asked me for a light
And offered me a sip of his wine but I declined
He smiled as he spoke through a cloud of smoke
He said, "I gave blacks AIDS and made crack from coke
I made good seem bad and bad seem good
And bought so many souls now I control your hood
With promises of riches, fame and fly bitches"
His game was so good it sounded religious
Kinda remind me of the reverend
Who tried to tell me he could sell me a ticket to Heaven
What good is it for a man to gain the whole
World if in the end he loses his soul?
Swallowed whole but only Jah control my destiny
So when you question me you only bring out the best in me
He asked me to rock so I took him to the mountain
He wanted water, I broke the earth and made fountains
That flowed and brought forth an infinite amount and
I paid dues and served mad crews but who's countin
I kept bouncin, kept climbin, never stopped rhymin
He said, "It's about time," I said, "No, it's about timin"
I know some of y'all probably thought I wouldn't drop it
Until you seen it comin, then you knew you couldn't stop it
I know some of y'all probably thought I wouldn't drop it
Until you seen it comin, then you knew you couldn't stop it
