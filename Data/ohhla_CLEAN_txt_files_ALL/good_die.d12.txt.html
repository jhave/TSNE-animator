[Intro]
Dawg, I shouldn't have LEFT
They wouldn't have TRIED that shit if I was witchu
Maybe we would've, picked another time or, maybe chose another way
Or maybe my prayers would've convinced Him to, choose another soul
Shiiit, it's just me and man Tony now
Man, you look so peaceful right now
How can I argue with that?
They say that the good die young

[Chorus: Kon Artis  singing]
They say that the good die young (die young)
That's why I think that you should have fun (when you're young)
Cause time won't wait for no one (uh-huh)
When God calls, you gotta go home (go home)
They say the good die young (die young)
That's why I know that we gon' have fun (huh?)
In this life Cuz, you only get one
When God call for me don't cry, I just went home

[Kon Artis]
Yo, I'm sure that everybody heard they momma say it be days like this
When you see, one of your friends die in the mist
In the struggle, into the circumstances
A risk that they take, just to prove a point to a friend
Even then, accidents are prone to happen
to any man or woman that's dumb enough to pretend it
Huh, God will hold 'em accountable for sins
that they commit and they try to repent the sins to repent
But  I guess that's the way things go
I was blessed to see twenty-fo'
To wake up to that "Hi, My Name Is..." video
Motivated me to write what I wrote
And I knew my little brother sold dope
And mom and daddy wanted to move our row
I did it  I still got a lot to prove and show
I just wish we ain't have to lose Bugz through the struggle
Cause you know..

[Chorus]

[Bizarre]
I know you used to Bizarre on some silly shit
But niggaz in my clique - is dyin quick (for real)
In Detriot, niggaz don't party
They pull a fo'-fo' out, snatch off Ducartis
That's why I keep the pistol under the truck
I'm 27 years old, too old to be gettin jumped
And fuck rap, I miss Karnail Pitts
B-U-G-Z, tatted on my wrist
Me and you in the jeep, listen to {?} beats
It's a shame me and Fuzz don't even speak
I got married, my wife name is Dee
Peace to 31, and 5150 bitch

[Kuniva]
Yo.. I think back on that tragic day my phone rung
And Bizarre's voice tellin me Bugz was goin home
It was like a knife piercin my chest and I couldn't breathe
I didn't wanna accept it, didn't wanna believe it
I swear, at his wake dawg I cried so hard
Literally - Denaun had to carry me to the car
While I stand in this booth now, it's tearin me apart
But I had to let it out cause it was tearin at my heart
Cause he died over somethin so petty and so small
A human life is so very precious, I hope y'all
understand how I'm feelin cause I love you Bugz
I wanna rhyme witchu, laugh witchu, hug you Bugz
But I can't, and you were so close to see your dreams
A coward came along and took you away from the team
So don't mistake this track as just another song
This goes out to everyone who lost a loved one
Cause you know..

[Chorus]

[Proof]
They say it's never too late to have an early childhood
If I could turn back the hands of time, God should
forgive what I did as a kid that run blocks
Now my dreams is just scream "Cops" and gunshots
The fun stops when your homie's up in the box
My duty Bo, rest assure, snuffed by the cops
I used to court shit a lot, if there's a guy I'd pprobably say somethin
If you love him so much why ain't you gave nothin?
But he took my homie's slippers only in eleventh grade
Now I hope to see his face at the Heaven gates
It ain't never late in the game, Satan remains
with a grudge to see slugs break through my frame
My heart aches with the pain, the light limits breath
We gotta have fun now, there's only minutes left
And in death cause stress young'uns is sucked in
To get tats for my fallen homies, I ain't got enough skin
Yes y'all!

[Chorus]

[Swifty McVay]
When I was younger I knew fo' brothers that wasn't wise
That crashed and the driver died
My partner on the passenger side was paralyzed
And I'm surprised by the look of that ride, that the other two survived
Nine months later, another one dies
Somebody shot him in his side when he was startin up his ride (AHH!)
Three years go by, I made a hell of a run
And that's when Funky got done, Joey playin with guns
And Tookie over funds, Cardie was my man
And Reggie, I wish that I was witchu in that van
And Bugz, if it wasn't for you
You know I wouldn't be standin in this booth
And that's the truth - I miss y'all

[Chorus]  repeat 2X</pre>
