[Snoop Dogg]
Cold game (cold game), new twist (new twist).
My niggaz step back and let me do this (do this)
Cuz I'm that 5-0 with em, getting 5-0's, sittin getting in the wind
For all my homies in the pen
It's back on
My backbone, my wife in my life &amp; down wit a nigga before my paper was tite.
Boo, you's a real bitch
I write that real shit
That them niggaz just got to get with
I bounce in and out of town just like a basketball player
Pass weed with the G's
And pass laws with the mayors
See, that's the difference between 
You, me, and him
Nigga, I'm Silk the Slim
With the feather in his brim
I swim under water and don't get wet
Then bounce back to the hood and C-walk the set
I keep it gangsta all the time
An you can ask the Doug, Insanes, and One-9
Cuz I'm

[Hook]
Born gangsta, stays on the move (Keep it tru, dawgz)

Born gangsta, keepin it true
None of y'all can stop me now
Cuz I'm havin papers now (Dogg Pound!)

[Snoop Dogg]
I stay on em like cop cars
Man, you watch your rabid-ass nine 
Tryin to stop cars hoo-bangin this fast-lane game
It ain't a thang
I was learnin this game when you was servin your cane
It's where my shit's at
Flip rats tryin to get some get-back
Sit back, an holla at a playa bout cold game
I stay Bout It (Bout It)
A bitch'll have you crossed up
An niggaz get you crossed out
I cant hang and bang wit y'all no more y'all niggaz flossed out
An papers what I'm all about
It's down that bullshit roll with y'all or take the baller
I take the baller out, he take the small amount
Long-term big shit
That's what I'm all about
Call em out, stall em out
Fuck em, I twist em
The hardhead never listen
They never recognize and they never pay attention
I stay G, and by the way did I mention young nigga

[Hook]
Born gangsta, stays on the move (Move on, move on)
Dogg Pound just for the fuck of it (D-P-G Dogg Pound!)
Born gangsta, keepin it true
