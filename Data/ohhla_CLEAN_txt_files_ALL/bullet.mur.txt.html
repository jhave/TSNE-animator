[Verse 2: Uncle Murda]
Shorty got her mouth open like she yawnin, yawnin
I put my pipe in it that's all she wanted, wanted
I heard she's messin with a famous rapper
I ain't 'gon say his name he might go home and smack her
She told me he in love he be lovin her
Once I heard that out of spite I start crushin her
Brown hair homey handcuffin her
You know me one night with the chick then I'm dumpin her
I was gettin gettin gettin some head
Then I'm back on the block gettin gettin that bread
My fo' fifth fully loaded loaded
Man wherever I go I tote it tote it
These little chumps don't want no drama
I valet your baby mama and your mama
Then hit yo' ass up with the llama
Have you screamin out yo I need a doctor doctor
