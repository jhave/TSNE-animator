You used to be my man, we used to be in love
Since we parted ways things is gettin rough
Just because I got a kid by you
Don't give you no reasons to act like a fool

[ Ed ]
Yo, you used to be my girl, but that was in the past
It's a shame that that shit didn't last
And just because we got a kid together
Don't give you no reasons to change like the weather

[ Free ]
Sometimes I reminisce on how it was before we dropped a seed
I was your everything and you was all I need
Stopped payin attention cause I gained a little weight
Pokin all these hookers, layin up from state to state
My stress level's risin to the highest, you begged me
To have your baby, now you're tryin to play me
And so I choose to move away from this drama
No longer in love, now you just my baby's father

[ Ed ]
What's up, you needs to shush up and hush up
Everything you hear you believe
You're Loud plus you Rifkin more than Steve
When I come through you make me leave
If I roll up on you like a sleeve
Don't get it twisted like braids or weaves
No welly, I'm off to the bank telly
Plus actin foul when my seed was in yo belly
You ain't the eight one on the section
The problem is we ain't together but we still keep sexin

[ Free ]
You tryin to keep the upper hand just because we got a kid
Don't give you the right to try to monitor the way I live
Where I go and who I date ain't no business of yours
No need for you to player-hate, you still get the drawers

[ Edo ]
The love used to be there, I don't know where the shit went
We was young and wasn't ready for commitment
Young ways at a young age
Two teenagers with a young seed to raise

[ Free ]
You used to be my man, we used to be in love
Since we parted ways things is gettin rough
And just because we got a kid together
Don't meant that the shit is gonna last forever

[ Ed ]
Yo, you used to be my girl, we used to be in love, baby
Since we broke up you started actin crazy
And just because we got a kid together
Don't give you no reasons to change like the weather

[ Ed ]
See you been on fire since the baby, flamin up
Started changin up with the rah-rah callin my peeps and hangin up
Speakin in a different tone now
On that young shit, even though we grown now
You on your own, but ain't raisin her alone
We can't even hold a decent conversation on the phone
Yeah, we lay down like SMPTE
You want me to hit you so you tempt me
Turnin Red like Simply
Don't take it out on my seed cause you resent me
It's unfulfilling, so in other words we empty
You talk about things you prepared to do
I was there when your fam wasn't there for you
And yo, I'm pointin fingers, like triggers
Your sisters is a bunch of golddiggers
With they kids around a million different niggas
Fake tears you cried and wept
Baby, walk the same path and follow in they footsteps

[ Free ]
You try to say them hurtful things and threaten me with fear
But I cried my last cry and shed my last tear
I did my best to keep you out of court for child support
But you don't do your job, it's like I'm married to the mob
Your friends be on some spy shit, I'm on some do-or-die shit
Survive it, I got to, I can't depend on you
Watchin her on weekends, thinkin you the shit
Callin it a favor when you babysit
You'se a part-time daddy with some part-time love
And I ain't stoopin to your level, I gots to rise above
Appreaciate I demonstrate, my ways could be much meaner
You be a clown and fuck around, I'm servin you subpeonas

[ Ed ]
You used to be my girl, that was in the past, baby
Since we parted ways you started gettin crazy
And just we got a kid together
Don't give you no reasons to change like the weather

[ Free ]
Yo, you used to be my man, we used to be in love
Since we parted ways things is gettin rough
Just because we got a kid togeher
Don't mean that the shit is gonna last forever

[ Ed ]
Yo, you used to be my girl, but that was in the past
It's a shame that that shit didn't last
And just because I got a kid by you
Don't give you no reasons to act like a fool
