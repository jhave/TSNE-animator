(Rakeem)
Yo, this is sexcapades, the sexcapades

[Chorus]
Baggin ladies, drive 'em crazy
That's my everyday routine
I don't bug on this, we be lovin it
They be singin "Oh we love Rakeem!"
And as I get them, I just hit them
With the center of my love
And once they're afflicted, they're addicted (why G?)
Cause they're on you like a drug

[Verse One]
So let me speak, on a goal I seek
How many freaks can I bag in the course of a week
Yo get this they strip with the quickness
Cause they can't resist the Ra style of slickness
Once activated, right, they become captivated
Sexually infatuated (by who?)
By the slick majestic kid wit the braids
What is this? And this is sexcapades
Episode one - I'm down at a store
Saw a young girl that I wanted to explore
I said "Peace, yo my name is Rakeem"
She replied "Hi, my name is Charlene
But all my friends, they call me Cha Cha"
I said "Word, now you can call me Ra Ra"
She said "Why, are ya rowdy?"
I said "Nah-hah that's not my style see
When brothers wanna shoot and have gang fights
I like to lounge and get pootang all night"
That was the end of the convo
Next thing you know, we're back at her condo
She had a grill like an actress, catch this
Jacuzzi and vibrating mattress
Now the Ra was on a mission
To do the Humpty Hump in a vertical postion

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Aiyyo, yo, yo
Let's get on with the episode
Scene two, I'm walking down Clove road
A day, a gloomy day
The plants cold scrubbin for light because the sky was gray
But I was lookin dope if I may say so (you may say so)
Cause my gear was in there like Prego
And as I walked I saw up ahead of me
A girl, top choice breed like a pedigree
Now now now now, I didn't wanna past yet
I stayed behind so I could sweat her assets
She had credentials, influential body potential
Somethin I would love to slide into
So, without a moment to waste
I slid over like I was slidin to home base
Yes I was successful, usin my special
Wu-Tang slang, that captured her brain
Next step, was sex yep
Not to disrespect, but I must protect my rep (you got to)
And at the crib I told her to entice me
She played Michel'le and said that she was NICETY
I said "Yo listen baby check it; it's one or the other
Liar, lover, fronter or fucker?
And guess which choice she chose
The one that had her lyin in my bed with no clothes
And the Ra was all on her
Cause you can save that NICETY shit for ya mama
DMD dicks 'em down
And skips town like Casanova Brown

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah and this is sexcapades, the sexcapades
The sex the sex the sexcapades
The sexcapades
Yo what time is it kid?
Yo It's time to get laid
And this is sexcapades (Word)
Yo what time is it kid?
Yo It's time to get laid
And this is sexcapades
The Riza Ra,
cuz the keem is ah lizah lah
Strikes again never hitting below the belt
'91 gettin things done
Word DMD type thang and I say
Power Equality Allah C-ees Equality
And that means P.E.A.C.E.</pre>
