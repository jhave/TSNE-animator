My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying that the hell is that mean?

First it was the Glock going hand to hand
Then I got to moving the gram by gram
Your boy get bread, thats without a doubt
One by one, I knocks them out

I get that paper nigga, I get that paper
Benz on chrome shoes, crib sitting on mad acres
If I dont get it on this time, Ill get it on the next flip
Ball blowing them bottles and creep off with the next bitch
Its recreation all, when its nothing to do
Fuck up a hater or two, or send a nigga at you
Gem star will scratch you,  youre just a rapper
In fact, youre a regular rapper
Say the wrong line and Ill get your ass wrapped up
Bass line bumping, whole spot dumping
Like  to my niggas, get the pumping
I blow bread nigga, heavy bread
It was rip to big now heavy dead
Now all the fat bitches ask if it was something

My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying what the hell is that mean?
I get, gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread
My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying that the hell is that mean?

My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying what the hell is that mean?
I get, gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread
I get, gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread

And I be swagging all day, I be swagging all day
Im from NY, but I fuck with
When Im out in the bay feels like home sweet home
Now niggas cant fuck with the shit Im on
Warrupdont get it fucked up
A nigga spot pumping out, get you stuck up
Out of habit, I got bad habits
Sem autos, and fully automatics
Click clack it, ra-ta-ta-tat it
Clap clap shit, reload, clap clap shit
I been doing this I dont need practice
I been doing this I dont need practice

My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying what the hell is that mean?
I get, gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread
My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying that the hell is that mean?
My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying what the hell is that mean?
I get, gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread
I get, gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread</pre>
