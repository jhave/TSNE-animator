This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby
This, this, this is a warning
This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby
This, this, this is a warning

Back of the liquor store bout to blaze this joint
Got some dice in my hand, my man says six is your point
Trying to hit the hard way so I can break like Steve Millar
Take the money then I run son, I'm a lover and a killer

This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby
This, this, this is a warning

I feel like God and the devil, I'm a saint, I'm a sinner
I'm a hard rocking, hard headed, hard sick summer winner
I'm a cooch blazing, bush chasing product of the city
And I ain't asking for your love and I don't want your pity
So girl don't talk about me shitty, don't act all high and ditty
Cause if your man keep playing me funny I'm a come take all his money
And leave him holy from this blessing with my four pound Smith-N-Wesson
Better watch out who you're stressin', fuck around you'll learn your lesson

This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby
This, this, this is a warning
This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby
This, this, this is a warning

Back of the liquor store tryin' to break these chumps
Bunch of heads in a circle, daddy's handing out lumps
Trying to shake these bones, I'm trying to get these shoes
But yo they all think Whitey's cheating cos tonight I can't lose
They wanna take my funds but I'm a blaze my guns
With burning sensations and heart palpitations
Why you breathing so heavy, while your palms all sweaty
And if you thinkin' bout a stick move, word to God you ain't ready

This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby
This, this, this is a warning
This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby
This, this, this is a warning

This is a warning, this is a warning
This is a warning, this, this is a warning</pre>
