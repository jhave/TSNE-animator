Song:   That Was My Life
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I ain't that person anymore
That ain't just what I'm living for
I ain't that person anymore oh no oh no
That was my life
That was my life
That was my life
That was my life

[Dre Murray]
Potential sex addict Just living for the thrill
Creating wounds that I thought for sure would never heal
I got a hole in my soul this world could never fill
But yet and still, I lie in lust like it will
And yet and still I'm knowing this is not your will
Following my way, living like you wasn't real
But see I knew the truth yeah I had tasted proof
But knowing God is something that I kept concealed
See the world is pushing, yeah the world was lying
Selling fairy tales yep yep I was buying
But my soul was crying Friends thought I was flying
Cause outside I'm a lion But inside I'm dying

I had some bad habits potential drug addict
Cause when it come to messing up yeah I was good at it
And When it came to giving love I never could have it
I'm close to giving up I'm crushed battered so shattered
Nothing good mattered I'm staying up at night
I'm staring at the ceiling wish my skin just wasn't white
I'm feeling lost in life I'm feeling nothings right
I'm feeling tossed aside stop the thoughts that cross my mind
And I could not decide I'm running out of time
these spoken lies lust and pride went and caught my eyes
I'm almost broke inside I'm living broke but high
I'm crying out who saves me now from this broken life

That was when you came Jesus that is your name
Freedom just when I changed freed up from all the chains
Freed up from sin and pain I seen potential gain
My life begins again and deep within I feel a change
You took the sin and blame so I am not ashamed
I was not okay but now I'm standing wide awake
My Debts are gone and paid my help is on its way
That life has gone away and this is why I'm free to say</pre>
