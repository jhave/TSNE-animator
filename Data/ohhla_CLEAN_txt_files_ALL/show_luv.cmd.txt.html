[C-Murder]
Yeah, check this shit out.  This is for all my real tank dogs
My No Limit soldiers out there buying my shit
Ya know, this is for you, you hear me?

Show me love
When you see me on the TV, show me love
On the video

I got a tank around my chest representing my home
I'm asking all the haters to leave me alone
And uh, much love to the calliope
I'm at the Soul Train awards representing my court
I did a show up in Texas with facing the boys
South park, fifth ward, nigga bringing the noise
Front row, nigga tatooed with TRU on his arm
That's props, that's why I put it in this song
Went to Cleveland for a three day tour
At the party at the tele couldn't take no more
My autograph sessions at the main event
Thanking all my friends for the money they spent
At the radio they loving my beats
Ninety-three while we be mean green streats
And my success goes to the man above
But uh, I'd like to thank my fans for showing me love

Show me love
All my niggas on the southside
Show me love
All my niggas on the northside
Show me love
All my niggas on the eastside
Show me love
All my niggas on the westside

[Mac]
When I was underground everybody down
Everybody show me love, cause I share common ground
With those niggas that was broke they laughed and joked
Them niggas was broke too but I'm a rapper so they think I'm not supposed to
But they still on my team cause I got fame
And everywhere I go people be yappin my name
Yeah I know Mac, we go back, me and that nigga tight
As a matter of fact he slept at my house the other night
It's cool I let alot of shit go cause I'm ambitious
When I'm fed up, nigga, I'm vicious
Hard to stay focused around these motherfucking locusts
And not to mention all the cochroaches
Crab ass niggas hate to see you lead a barrel
Signed me a contract and got me a Camaro
And now they acting like I did them wrong by progressing
I'm guessing that they wanted me to stay up in sections with little pocket
money
To get a nigga who was going my way
Y'all niggas dont know, I got so much shit I won't say
I'm damn near breaking in tears as I'm speaking these words
This same motherfucker from the third, show me love nigga

Ya heard me, to all my niggas on the southside
Show me love
Ya heard me, all my niggas on the northside
Show me love
Show a nigga some love nigga 
On the eastside
Show me love
And all my niggas on the westside

[Mr. Serv-On]
It's four in the morning, mamma got tears in her face
Love from my tombstone try to relocate
But in my tank lord I got faith
Five hundred dollars or so for my block
Lord knows I couldn't stop
That's a long way from bad credit cards and selling rocks
For the love I've got and in return I'm putting it down
Chi town, on my gd's, on six and thirty hos 
And my vl's on the westside
I ride with jack time ballers
Drink alazay (?) and hennessee with Jakeville shot callers
I'm gettin love from niggas on Breakstreet
And Watts, and Cappanella park and LA
The thirties in the Bay, brown love for my esses
That's a long damn way from the parkway
So when I'm home, see a nigga drop a nigga from above
(Cmon, cmon) Show me love

To all my niggas on the westside
To all my niggas on the eastside
To all my niggas on the northside
To all my niggas on the southside
To all my bangers on the westside
To all my bangers on the eastside
To all my bangers on the northside</pre>
