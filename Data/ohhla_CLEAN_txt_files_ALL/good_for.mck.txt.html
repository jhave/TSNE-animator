Song:   Good For You
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Now you know what's good for you
Got that, not gonna warn you
We got that to make it right right right
You know all women, I adore you
Bodies {?}
The energy, melody life life life

Now you know what's good for you
Got that, not gonna warn you
We got that to make it right right right
You know all women, I adore you
Bodies {?}
The energy, melody life life life

See I don't know why I gotta go and creep around
You've seen me and my penis {?}
Not used to having to sleep without somebody
And I've been chugging alcohol and I'm leaving now
And I don't wanna go home alone tonight
I was freaking with some hunny named Lisa
She was squeezing alpha {?} Puerto-Rican Diva
Weaving her hair with the cleavage
{?}
She's flashing the keys to go peep the house
And then my phone rings, it's my girl on the line

It's like, I don't know what the hell to do
It's like women like this are subtle {?} and few
I'm fucked up in the club with a blunt and a butt
But my love will hang up if I tell her the truth
See, I can be a selfish dude especially when
I'm off a blunt and a brew but
But she's so sexy, now let me spend the night
It's like HELP, either way I'm screwed

Get it?
See if I lie, I got my conscience to deal with
But if I go with the lie {?} then I'm gonna get
To grind with a fine Puerto-Rican Brazilian
But is it really worth it? I don't know
I gotta ask myself that question
Booty's truly {?} an option but {?}
My girl Evan

Now you know what's good for you
Got that, not gonna warn you
We got that to make it right right right
You know all women, I adore you
Bodies {?}
The energy, melody life life life

Now you know what's good for you
Got that, not gonna warn you
We got that to make it right right right
You know all women, I adore you
Bodies {?}
The energy, melody life life life

I don't wanna do it but I can't help it
I'm so selfish
Lady, what you want me to say?
Foolish
The lies and deception
I tried to confess it
Committed, but I still wanna play

If I gave into the fact that you hate me and take me back
I'm saving face by staying at the bar
And embracing this Jack
She wanna leave, I can tell by the way
She react to the mouth piece
No more dollar drinks so she
Followed me with the house keys
And I know what I'm doing is wrong
Hoping that you were the one
But out 'til like two in the morn
With nobody you wanna know
It's comforting to know you're home
When I'm out on the road
I know you're lonely though
Or maybe got some flow of your own

In the looking glass, you shake your ass
I sat back and I watched
Then I took your hand, and we both danced
While thinking of the thoughts
It might've been the circumstance that hurt
This man - I'm a circus act at most
Nobody's perfect girl, it's a perfect world
But we don't have to know
And I'm not trying to justify it
But I might try to simplify it
One touch and I'm mesmerized
So I mess around in disguise
Flesh to the eyes, test to the lies
Sex gets my vote unless...
You're destined to die with the one
Next to your side
Fsho

I don't wanna do it but I can't help it
I'm so selfish
Lady, what you want me to say?
Foolish
The lies and deception
I tried to confess it
Committed, but I still wanna play

Now you know what's good for you
Got that knock {?} and I warn you
We got that to make it right right right
And all women, I adore you
Bodies {?}
The energy, melody life life life</pre>
