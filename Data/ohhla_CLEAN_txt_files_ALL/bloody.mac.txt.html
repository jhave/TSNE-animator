Chorus: [Mac/(Magic)]

Niggas really wanna die tonight 
You know you fucking with a rider right
We can all get bloody if you want to
You gotta crew, I gotta crew, so what you wanna do
( What you wanna do nigga)
Niggas really wanna die tonight 
You know you fucking with a rider right
We can all get bloody if you want to
You gotta crew, I gotta crew, so what you wanna do
( What you wanna do nigga)

[Mac]
Now what yall mean, niggas on my team, they all about the cream 
And my enemies, we take it to extreme,to get the green
Nahmean, turn the block to a murder scene
and I be screaming whoa, in the drop with my nigga Wop
Runnin from the cop who was trying to meet that quota
I'm young and I'm black so they be thinking I'm slanging that baking soda
You ain't heard about, nigga from that dirty south, keep a boot in his mouth
bitch everybody yelling bout it, let 'em know what you bout
Before you leave your house, cause at night, nigga freaks come out
Get the gat with the extra clip cause if you catch us slippin 
You might be the next to rip, get shot get stab you get cut up strip
you boxed up in a ship, thinking niggas on some retaliation tip
Then take a trip to the land 
where them niggas do the murder man dance on the enemies
And fake niggas that pretend to be friends of me, 
are the ??? nigga can't fuck with me
Won't buck with me the murda murda kill kill for scrilla
Cap pilla turned rap dealer chose the style
Your style, my style, our style
turn up the beat loud so we can all get wild

Chorus: [Mac/(Magic)]

Niggas really wanna die tonight 
You know you fucking with a rider right
We can all get bloody if you want to
You gotta crew, I gotta crew, so what you wanna do
( What you wanna do nigga)
Niggas really wanna die tonight 
You know you fucking with a rider right
We can all get bloody if you want to
You gotta crew, I gotta crew, so what you wanna do
( What you wanna do nigga)

[Mac]
Is your niggas in the air like mine
can they make a M-16 sound like mine?
Get hit with a stray from a big ole' K
get up say never die they just walk away
Nigga Mac got something to say
I get to bucking they better get to ducking and its getting to fucking 
It's real tell them niggas I'm back, heavy triggers that's fat
We got grenades now let a nigga hit you with that
You get gutted, throw in them dogs in the mud and get mudded
That's what you get when you fuck around with my buddies
Murda Murda and this shit is so love, man them niggas can't fuck with me
Won't buck with me the murda murda kill kill for scrilla
Cap pilla turned rap dealer chose the style
Your style, my style, our style
turn up the beat loud so we can all get wild

Chorus: [Mac/(Magic)]

Niggas really wanna die tonight 
You know you fucking with a rider right
We can all get bloody if you want to
You gotta crew, I gotta crew, so what you wanna do

[Magic]
So you want to get bloody
Fucking with my niggas is like fucking with my money, you think it's funny 
Twist ya, make your momma miss ya
Tell your baby momma bye and tell your kids kiss ya, dismiss ya
45 words that you spoke with your tongue
Mac pass the gun and his killing is done
You niggas aint heard, Magic from the 9th and Mac's from the 3rd
You don't want to war with me but you done went far with me
Put him in the trunk this punk is dead, I done hit him in his head 
with a .45 slug, now he coughing up blood
I'm a 225 pound nigga rapper slash killer cap pella grave filler
So what you wanna do, No Limit is my back bone
Slap a tank on your back if you say something wrong
About the clique I'm with, I'm a sick man 
Wanna take his 5 grand, I'll leave with your dick in your hand
And I'm a grown man, and I'm down with Mac
So all you so called killers better step back 

Chorus: [Mac/(Magic)]

Niggas really wanna die tonight 
You know you fucking with a rider right
We can all get bloody if you want to
You gotta crew, I gotta crew, so what you wanna do

Niggas really wanna die tonight 
You know you fucking with a rider right
We can all get bloody if you want to
You gotta crew, I gotta crew, so what you wanna do
