Yeah, yeah (Hey...yeah...)
Lil' J (I need love, love, love, love)
What

When I'm alone in my room or when I'm out at the mall
Or in the back of a limo I hear my conscience call
Saying, "J, you need a girl who's as sweet as a dove"
For the first time in my life, I see I need love
There I was giggling about the games
That I had run on many girls and I ain't sayin' no name
Then the thought occurred, memories made my heart hurt
As I said to myself, "Look what you've done to her"
And her and her and her, can't explain how it feels
Bein' J, see and girls knowin' nothin' is real
Playin' make-believe, pretendin' that I won't leave them
Catch me in the streets, I'm actin' like I don't see them
Tellin' them things I know they wantin' to hear
Whisper, then sittin' so close, like a ice in the ear
Let 'em know when you with me you got nothin' to fear
Usually feelings I'm fakin', now I'm makin' it clear
Baby, you know my word is down with platinum and gold
One of half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old
But the other half deserves passion and trust
Forever lasting crush, 'cause mami, it's just us
I need love

Loving you, love from you
All those others I can choose
Don't wanna choose to lose
I need love [I need love]

Loving you, love from you
'Cause it's you I can't resist
On my lips I want a kiss
I need love from you

She got immaculate hands, exquisite feet
Her eyes, lips and body make the picture complete
It ain't all physical though, her mind is real
Always wantin' to communicate, say how she feel
Never notice the whip, just playin' the wheel
Baby T is west tech spinnin' danger chill
Sun glistenin' on your skin, it's the prettiest sight

Smile bright enough to light up the city at night
So ma, where you're at, you're neither here nor there
I swear I can't find you anywhere
Damn sho' ain't in the studio or out in the club
This love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are, I'll add J on the scene
See, the image is plain, for every king need a queen
I'll search the whole world for my special girl
When I finally find her, cop her a Lex to twirl
I need love

Loving you, love from you
All those others I can choose
Don't wanna choose to lose
I need love [I need love]

Loving you, love from you
'Cause it's you I can't resist
On my lips I want a kiss
I need love from you

Soon as I wake up I wanna hear your voice
Callin' me on the phone
Tellin' me, tellin' me, tellin' me
That you need me, me, my love
I've gotta see your face, hear your voice
Baby, baby, baby
I need, I need love [I need love]

Loving you, love from you
All those others I can choose
Don't wanna choose to lose
I need love [I need love]

Loving you, love from you
'Cause it's you I can't resist
On my lips I want a kiss
I need love from you

Girl, listen to me
When I be sittin' in my room all alone
Fantasies run through my mind
And I come to see that I need true love
And if you wanna be there for me, girl
I need you to make yourself seen
I'll be waiting, I love you

Loving you, love from you
All those others I can choose
Don't wanna choose to lose
I need love [I need love]

Loving you, love from you
'Cause it's you I can't resist
On my lips I want a kiss
I need love from you</pre>
