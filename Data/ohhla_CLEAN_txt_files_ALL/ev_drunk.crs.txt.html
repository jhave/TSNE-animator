[Intro/Chorus: 8Ball sample]
"E'rybody with me drunk as fuck, break it down and roll it up" {*9X*}

[Ludacris]
Okay oh, okay now e'rybody with me drunk as FUCK, break it down and {"roll it up"}
Yeah, e'rybody get they killers wit 'em, rep yo' side and throw it up
Po' it up and it's goin down, light another blunt and it's goin 'round
Puff puff pass, you could toast yo' glass, later we'll +Screw+ and slow it up
If you make it fast I can make it last, and I'm a nigga that's makin cash
Eight figures in the bank and I'll pull yo' rank, what you think wit your hatin ass?
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee - heh, you think you fly I know you not
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee - you tote yo' knife I tote my glock
Big body Cadillac, women in the back seat, speakers steady pumpin as I pass these losers
Yo' car too small, I can't fit my women in a PT Cruiser
Get your cake up, get your weight up, way up to the top 'til you can't go further
These snitches is after my riches and yes I smell bloody murder
When I cock back better drop that, can't block that lock that, fools better stop that
Otherwise you could pop back, but after dumpin a round you'll be wonderin where the cops at
Where the cops at? Cause I'm drunk as FUCK, tell 'em I'm far from sober
Cause if the po'-po' happen to pull me over - I'ma just tell 'em

[Chorus]

[Lil Scrappy]
Ay Luda, you know niggaz over here, over here kushed out, iced out nigga
G's Up nigga, it's Scrappy, O-K-K-KAY!

E'rybody with me, bitches lookin tipsy, goons posted up case a hater try to tempt me
Pull out the roach, roll up the dough, money I'ma throw again holla at my folk
All I need is a bitch right now, to blow me away then take me down
I need another fuckin Conjure round, hot wing, Gucci, out to the lounge
You might just see me but I can't dig deep nigga with gold teeth
Nigga then O-D on VSOP, and if not now slowly but surely
Shake 'em like LeBron, shoot 'em like Kobe, if they say chill I just pay the police
In the club chillin with G-S-U-P, but after go down it's in D.T.P.
That's a rock, got you pissy and you dizzy, wanna hit me
But not really, please don't mix me, I'm a boss, my dogs bite quickly
If nobody's out here with me I'ma do this shit myself
Smoke and drink off for my health{?} like I don't need nobody else
Scrap's so true to smokin crucial, swishin on swishas with Luda
I'm, in the Playas Circle, this G shit you hoes ain't used ta
I got my own kush pack and got my own liquor
"Ay what you call that?" I call it Cleveland Now nigga!
