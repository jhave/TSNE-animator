(Let's do this, aiyyo it's like this man, aiyyo! (*Hold, you, down)

[Verse 1: Prodigy] (*Sample of "Hold You Down")
When it comes to teks, I'm similar to a menace
Like Ol' Dog sniffin caine couldn't fuck with the damage
That I do to a bastard keep playin around
Won't be nobody strong enough to (*Hold, you, down)
Yeah, I leave 'em in shock
People get sentenced to life they stressed in the box
Most of my friends got murdered and damn I feel lost
Wish I was there when they popped off to (*Hold, you, down)
Nobody but me, I got a whole gang of killers but that's how you gotta think
If you wanna make it alive in all in one piece
It takes much more of them things to (*Hold, you, down)
Yeah, yo sonny, I'm well connected in the streets
We loyal to each other when it comes to that beef we get (*Down)
Don't worry 'bout a thing dun dun I foreverly (*Hold, you, down)

[Chorus: Nina Sky] (*Sample of "Hold You Down")
(***Lil' Kim sample from "All About the Benjamins")
Even when shit gets hard I'm going to make sure that I'm around to hold you (*Down)
Will never leave your side until the day I die I'm gonna (*Hold, you, down)
Recognize that this game could be hard
Long as you roll with me, we are (*Down)
Here by your side always to (***Hold me down baby!) (*Hold, you, down)

[Verse 2: Alchemist] (*Sample Of "Hold You Down")
Yeah, yo, when the time is worst
Never leave my fam in a jam I'm dyin first
Never (*Down) to my last dollar I'm grindin first
Never take the stand on my fam I'm silent first (*Hold, you, down)
It's goin down, feel me The Alchemist in the flesh
And I love this profession but I throw it all away in a second cause I'm (*Down)
For the cause when my life is threatened
Taken this and that maybe that'll (*Hold, you, down)
Now you know how we cooks the pot up
You could get caught up in some things you would not wanna so slow (*Down)
And watch how I mold the sound so when I ain't around the music still (*Hold, you, down)
But I'm a keep my eyes open yo I don't even blink
Keep my pen movin down the line I don't even think, just write it (*Down)
On the paper get my vocals in sync
Check how it sound (*Hold hold hold hold you you you you you you you you down)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Illa Ghee] (*Sample of "Hold You Down")
To all my people I war for, blow the four four for, you know I gets (*Down)
Even if we trapped standin back to back I'll (*Hold, you, down)
No matter if you wrong or right you still right, for you I lay a man (*Down)
I don't care if it's the president I cock my heat, and (*Hold, you, down)
For all y'all chickens in the club
If you hop in the truck, first thing y'all gonna go (*Down)
And when we get to the telly I'm a bend you over and (*Hold, you, down)

[Verse 4: Prodigy]
Aiyyo! Mobb, thugs, drops and trucks
We got enough paper to front, you see our guns and duck (*Down)
Somebody fittin to get wigged, homey I hold your outfit a (*Hold, you, down)
I seriously doubt it, my chain cost a quart a mill imagine what I spend gun shoppin
Get bullets by the thousands they say that we whylin
And I'm far from recluse, we fight on front street with them fullies in the coupe
Before the drama and the shootin, then I take bullets and die to (*Hold, you, down)

[Chorus &amp; Outro: Nina Sky] (*Sample of "Hold You Down")
Even when shit gets hard I'm going to make sure that I'm around to hold you (*Down)
Will never leave your side until the day I die I'm gonna (*Hold, you, down)
Recognize that this game could be hard
Long as you roll with me, we are (*Down)
Here by your side always to (*Soon, you'll, un-der-stand)</pre>
