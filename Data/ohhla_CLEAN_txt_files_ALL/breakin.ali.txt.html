[Intro - Brother Ali]
(Hmmmmmmm)
Ha, ha, ha
Hey, hey, heeey
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha (another day), ha
Hey, hey, heeey, ah (Lord I just gotta find a way)

[Verse 1 - Brother Ali]
Old master had a leper for a child
Left him out to fend for his self in the wild
They laughed at him anytime he went to town
So he kept to his self and he seldom came around
Loved life and he loved his kin
But he couldn't understand why they ain't love him
Slept out in the shed all alone
And all he ever wanted was some friends of his own
A few hands saved him, took him in and raised him
Taught him about love and struggle and patience
Gave him the family comfort he was cravin
He worked when they work and he sang when they sang
He sang so clear and so loud
That the masters of the children could hear him from the house
They recognize his voice and ran out
Everybody wanna know what the ruckus all about y'all

[Chorus 1 - Brother Ali] - 2X
Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall, speak loud, boy that's the way
Them songs of yours, bring us a brand new day

[Break - Brother Ali]
Ha, ha (another day), ha
Hey, hey, heeey, ah (Lord I just gotta find a way)

[Verse 2 - Brother Ali]
See good Lord, I've been waitin so long
For y'all to come out here and take me in the home
The world's so cold with no place to belong
They said "come on in boy, sing your song"
He stepped inside and to his surprise
It was so damn fly, he can't believe his eyes
Ate and he drank and he felt satisfied
'Til he sat by the window and he glanced out-side
Loved ones out workin
Eyes got full and his heart start hurtin
'Cause them folk been singin for years
But ain't any one of them set foot up in here
Hold up, how you get so much
Livin off folk like us that got it so rough
The way you hold 'em in your cold clutch
Makes me think that you don't love your own soul enough

[Chorus 2 - Brother Ali]
Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall, speak loud, boy that's the way
Them songs of yours, bring us a brand new day

Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall, speak loud, boy that's the way
Them songs of yours, give us a brand new day

[Break]

[Verse 3 - Brother Ali]
Closed his eyes as he sang every note
The songs he was taught and the ones that he wrote
Stood up, cleared his throat, grabbed his coat
In those last moments, a few words were spoke
"I used to peak at this old house in awe
Imaginin what it must be like and all
And this the finest spread these eyes ever saw
But I don't mind sayin I feel sorry for y'all
All that gettin, so little givin
Led a lot of y'all to forget what's missin
Built you a big pretty prison to sit in
Strut around here, convinced that that's livin
But we gonna keep on singin
Keep on solderin, keep on buildin
Keep on teachin and keep on listenin
And keep, keepin on, 'til the whole thing's different"
In the shed, the sun start to set
Said all his prayers and laid down his head
Everything said that he needed to say
And one of these mornings we'll wake up to a brand new

[Chorus 2]
