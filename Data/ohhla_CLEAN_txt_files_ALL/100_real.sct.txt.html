Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Shout out to my essay, shout out
Shout out to my essays. (amigos)
Chip it by the low
Ship it by the low

Shout out to my essay
Man, that nigga got me stained
All these niggas can't know me
'Cause we keep a lot of money
Man, we stand on these niggas so hard
Couldn't look anywhere
Front whip, wouldn't pull up
Ew, awe, hey, take a trip
Flying out to Mexico
My essay's got it planned out
He sent 'em back
Got sending cash
Everybody come with their hands out
I'm shipping it all, I sell it all
Y'all niggas here, aren't worth it
You see why I came, said?
T H E niggas can't even see my essay

[Chorus]

Trunk full of bricks
That amigo gang got plumped prices
Free Mario, 94 bitch
Real dope boy, like my cousin, not a snitch
You know I know essay
And essay, he bring most stuff
It gonna cost you more if I bring
The finger for her
'Cause I don't trust my lawyers
This whole world is of lawyers
These bloods still in order
Most of them cost you
Everyday a payday
Counting with my essay
And we counting a [?]
I know the police watching
My essay got me toppling
I'm in the hood, shopping
You want some slag, I got it!
You want some bricks, then count it

[Chorus]</pre>
