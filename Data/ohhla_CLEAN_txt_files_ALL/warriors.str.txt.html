[Chorus]
Warriors...Come out and Play!
Warriors...Come out and Play!

[Verse 1]
Yo, come along this way, it's Burning Star all night all day
I'll put my vibes on play and never stop until they say " Ok Ok Ok..
Ok, Ok, Ok, those Words you say are true in fact
But don't delay talking that, the reasons why we co-created
Burning Star
We walk like Warriors, in Babylon my word is Bond
I know we've gone this far, but still we have to keep it on
Your word is Bond, Right or Wrong, they bring the War, we bring the calm
Just like a Storm, we rain Supreme, this ain't a dream although it seems..

[Chorus]
Warriors...Come out and Play!
Warriors...Come out and Play!

[Verse 2]
We intrigue all those who never discipline their deeds
And the chosen are few, so it's our destiny to lead
In physical form, we storm this world of conviction
We Love the Righteous and Poor and keep our lessons non-fiction
so listen and heed, you must build like a Slave
To live like a King, in these lands of the Brave
Where the Warriors run, not from Fear or from Gun
But from the call of their Spirit, ever chasin' the Sun!

[Chorus]
Warriors...Come out and Play!
Warriors...Come out and Play!</pre>
