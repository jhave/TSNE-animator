[Hook]
He gonna give you all his love
He gonna give you all his time
He won't let a minute go by
Without the thought of you crossing his mind
I be like fuck a bitch, I'm trying to stay rich
I'm trying to concentrate on hoes
Even if I fuck that bitch do the freakiest shit
By the mornin, I got the go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got all kind of bitches, a vet bitch, a beginner bitch
My phone ringing and I ain't answering cause I'm in a bitch
I'm more like a pimp than a trick, I send a bitch
50's and lead escorts, call me the runner bitch
If we going out we going Dutch pay for your dinner bitch
Look bitch, this is my life I'm on some different shit
Every different day I wake up to play with a different bitch
Bitches love me, just like I love me
Fat bitch, skinny bitch, short bitch, tall bitch
You wanna buy me shit, meet me at the mall bitch
In the strip club, let her lick your ass bitch
Get the cash bitch and then go back to your man bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got a ghetto bitch, a good bitch, a certified hood bitch
She with me to do the to the end, bitch fuck me and her friend
I said I'm headed to the top bitch I'm trying to get it all
A real bitch will be there for a nigga if he fall
The club pack front to the back up in this bitch
Got on my Louie checkers grey and black up in this bitch
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds, diamonds on my neck
Bitch niggas front if you want, we got swimmers on deck
Get your ass hit over a bitch
The bitch ain't shit she in a porno clip with a bitch
She can't suck dick but damn nigga use your head
She gonna find another dick to suck when you're dead

[Hook]

[Outro]
West side
This that shit right here!
Feel like it's supposed to be on that Detox!
Yeah
Niggas think they're better than me, but they're not!
Fuck that! I'm just gonna start over
So we gonna act like I ain't been that nigga for 8 years
And I'm a new nigga! Call me Ferrari! GGGGGG-UNNNIIIT!</pre>
