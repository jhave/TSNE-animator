Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus: Russell Lee]
She's in love with a hustla
She only messing with them suckas
Looking so good, little tight jeans on and G-string on
And I know that she be feeling me

[Baby Beesh]
She in love with a hustla, someone she could trust uh
Someone she could get down with, cause she don't mess with suckas
Sleep all day, and grind all night
Living in the fast lane, the game's nothing polite
So I'm laced up tight, cause I ain't into lagging
She love to watch me in the mirror when I'm doing my stabbing
And she ain't into punks, giving em bruises and bumps
And she know I blow big, so she be twisting my blunts
That's real talk, coming from a real hog on the block
She love the playboy lifestyle, the knots and the rocks
And even though sometime, it might seem strange
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs

[Chorus]
(*ad-libs*)

[Baby Beesh]
Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance
And end up with a over jealous sucka romance
Love to see me get the lapdance every now and then huh
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh
Now that's living like, who's the boss
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce
Even though she approached by them big time ballas
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa
And her parents just don't understand
What kind of man she in love with, but she don't give a damn

[Chorus]
(*ad-libs*)

One day we gone get it together
One day we gone keep it together - 4x

[Chorus - 2x]
(*ad-libs*)</pre>
