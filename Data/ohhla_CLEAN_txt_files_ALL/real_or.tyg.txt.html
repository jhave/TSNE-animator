[Verse 1]
Kill a flow cuckoomani, last king and on the daily
Call a mother fucker, buy the government, but call me crazy!
Yeah I'm on that fucking juice
Have a sip I'll fuck you later
Money on my table, pick it up, I'll call it tip the waiter
Yeah, I'm the first to last, alpha, omega
I ain't trying to talk, bitch I'm concentrating!
I'm the dopest nigga, word to Ronald Reagan
She don't play no games, she blow me like a Sega
Hundred thousand on my tax
Twenty thousand on my tats
No lie, I've got twelve hundred snapbacks
Go yard everywhere, bitch I'm ballin
Young money running shit, you niggaz just jogging
Shoutout Drizzy I'm posted in Toronto
Ice so bright, diamonds on vinalargo
Uh, wine bottles, Uh barely drunk
Shades on nigga don't be trying to say what's up!

[Chorus]
Cause you're real or fake, real or fake
Real or fake, real or fake!
Most bitches, niggaz gone be real or fake
Real or fake, real or fake!
Real or fake, real or fake!
Real or fake, real or fake!
Yeah, real or fake!
Most bitches, niggaz gone be real or fake
Yeah, real or fake, bitch!

[Verse 2]
Hotter then the summer coupe
South beach fountain blue
Cherry pie leather seats rubies on tomato soup
German shepherd in my engine, barking at you scary bitches
Best defense, nigga money kissin?!
Had a couple tickets, I was young into wrestling
Choke slam a nigga, big show pick em
I'm on my P's and Q's
I don't ask questions, I figure shit out
Multiplying decimals
Son of Hecklin in my denim, lick the bullet like a lizard
Couldn't see me with a sigma, definately ill autism
Hard alliance but its Tyga hotter then a fucking iron
Put that bitch on silent cause she talking like she tiring
Too much, Uh niggaz say they baby mommas love me
Crazy, I was on a tour with Diddy counting that Ciroc money
But it's young money, YM hoe
T Raw go, nigga they know!

[Chorus]
Real or fake, real or fake!
Real or fake, real or fake
Most bitches, niggaz gone be real or fake
Real or fake, real or fake, bitch!
Real or fake, real or fake, bitch!
Real or fake, real or fake, bitch!
Yeah, real or fake!
Most bitches, niggaz gone be real or fake
Yeah, real or fake, bitch!

[Outro]
I ain't got no time!
I ain't got no time!
I ain't got no time!
Stop blowin up my cellphone
I ain't got no time!
I ain't got no time!
I ain't got no time!
Stop blowing up my cellphone</pre>
