{*Projector noise stops*}
{*Ken Kaniff walks up to the microphone, grasshopper chirping is the only background noise*}

{*Microphone screaches*}

[Ken Kaniff]
Uhhh-nmm

{*He taps the microphone*}

This thing on?
Where'd everybody go?
Uhh
Guess who's back?
Back again
Ken is back
Tell some men
Rub my back
Rub my back
Rub my back
Rub my back
Oooh
Wait
Hello?

{*Voice goes faint, realising no-one is there to listen*}

Uhh
Goodbye</pre>
