Rampage:

Fuck all you niggas makin' minimal wages
Yo, I'm proud and on the street like my name was Larry Davis
The brown-skinned brother with the shelltoe flavas
People talkin shit it's yo' next door neighbours
About me n' KRS
Who rocks the best
Niggas wanna picket sign and protest
From Hempstead to Westbury
I'm 3 platinum LPs
Take off them Stobalees
Now who's the truckas
Boy Scout and Frankie Cutlass
Flipmode is da squad we brings da ruckus
Fuck all you crab muthafuckas
Yo I'm criminal minded
Boy Scout been let out the cage
I'm on the loose
I'm in the Flatbush town
It's goin down 
I still got my tre and my 4 pound
Warriors come out and play
I'm in the Bronco with O.J.
I'm comin' back around your way
Yo watch me sweep the nation if you black or caucausian
I'm nice with mine
Leavin the microphone blazin
From here to the projects
I'm droppin brothas all over the land
Like Tokyo did Japan
Let me take a stand
I'm the million dollar man
Ay yo, shit hits the fan

Doo Wop:

Ay yo, live from New York where niggas shoot to kill
Cutlass, bring da ruckus and ya looses ill
Keep it goin' by, I keep flowin' the same
And get open like the pussy on mystic rain 
Showin no shame cuz my name maintain
The cocaine weight rawest nigga on tape
CDs we bump by the key
Plus the LP
Is guaranteed lactose free 
Ay yo we got the yajo
Frankie, Beverley and Maze
Will leave the crowd in a daze before we let go
Wop rock the Echo
Unlimited gear with the Fubu
Catch me politickin' with Premier and The GURU
I be stickin' chicken like the colonel, Nocturnal
CD number 6 in my whip
Bounce is the squad that'll Flip
You niggas talk shit then abandon ship
All that lip but you can't back it
Fagot niggas get they wig splattered
Battered, rappers
Livin' in the shelter 
When they felt the 
Wrath of Doo Wop, Rampage and Heltah Skeltah

Chorus: Rock

Ay Yo who them headz keep the party live?
Ruck, Rock, Ramp, Doo Wop Feel the Vibe
Frankie Cutlass
Y'all can't touch this, we live
We keep the party live
C'mon Feel the Vibe
(repeat 2X)

Rock:

Hey Ho (Voice Cracks)
Here we go, better yet, here we come
Tawl Sean and Jab the bum
Call him Bummy Jedab
Smash dat his ass quick fast
1/45th blast
And make one drop and 10 more get whiplash

Ruck:

I be the T-A-W-L
Bringin' the trouble to
Couples who rap off track
Ya wack so I'm rubbin' you
Off the map with my gat black so I'm snubbin' you
Dubbin' you
The wackest nigga on the universe
You be the first to witness lyrical techniques I disperse
(Rock)Until the day we die
(both)Heltah Skeltah let the brainz burst

Rock:

We cooool
But not that cool like September 
Spring to Winter
I be turnin y'all Battlecats to Kringer

Ruck:

Contenders, he bend ya, then send ya to the
R-U-C-K-U-S when blessed off of buddah
I troop the terain maintain my composure
I fold ya, holdin' my sose then screamin' Eshkoshkah

Rock:
So um
Raise yo hand if you sure Rock'll smell ya
And if ya ready for the war scream Heltah Skeltah
(Ruck)Heltah Skeltah
Ruck n' Rock flip till we got it locked 
If not, we make it hotter than the glocks in lye spots bitch
