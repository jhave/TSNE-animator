Song:   Mind Playin Tricks On Me '94
Typed by: OHHLA.com

I sit alone in my four cornered room starin' at candles
Are we on the radio dukes?
Awww yeah, give it to me

Yeah, at night I can't sleep
I'm tossin' and turnin'
I still got the candlesticks burnin'
It ain't changed but it's a different time
And I'm still playin' tricks with my mind
My mothers always stressin' that I'm livin' wrong
But I got my Smith and Wesson so I'm gettin' grown
And their lookin' at your little boys success
And I been thinkin', I'm dealin' with too much stress
So I stay up on my p's and q's
And watch out for the G's and fools
Cause the homies that I thought I had 
See me stackin' up a grip
And they just started talkin' bad
So I stay away from outsiders
And when I roll through, it makes 'em open they mouth wider
I used to think that you was my one and only homie
My mind was playin' tricks on me
My mind was playin' tricks on me

Yeah

Dear diary I'm havin' a little trouble with my mind state
How many bullets would it take to change my mind? wait
Sometimes I want to end it but I don't though
They tell me see my pastor but I don't go
Cause they all be on this one street
So I take it on myself to thank him one deep
And give my money to the most needy
And never put it in the hands of the most greedy
Cause their puttin' a price tag on a man's word
And it's a fashion show, so the men flirt
The world is endin' so they try to make us switch fast
And they openin' up these churches for some quick cash
And usin' the money fo' they new cribs
While brother Johnson just got kicked out where he lived
I follow no man, cause man be phoney
My mind was playin' tricks on me
My mind was playin' tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't seem to keep my mind on a steady track
I'm all about gettin' mine so I study that
But it seems they want to get me
So I try to keep my nine millimeter wit me
Just in case they want to see a homies head blown
But I got to stay around to see my kids grown
I finally found a woman who could deal wit me
Back then I had a woman who wouldn't real wit me
And now she's back with her old lady
And now I got it goin' on and they sure hate me
Now I'm a gone and she's alone 
hahahaha, her mind was playin' tricks on her
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
Bringin' it back like this here 
1-9-9-1 all the way to the 1-9-9-4 and they me Face
My mind was playin' tricks on me
