[Chorus: DJ Paul - repeat 2X]
Got a nigga gone got a got a nigga gone
Got a got a nigga gone
Off that Hennessey and Hydro

[Verse 1: I-20]
I'm droed out dead drunk and even off them Ex pills
My foots alone could make ya groan and even give ya neck chills
I call Paul hit up Juice and now we on the Jazzy T
I got my heat in case they creep cuz that's just how these niggaz be
I'm slow motion slow ridin lookin for some slow head
You know 2-0 I'm eastside what I rep until I'm dead
7 deuce Catalina all chrome and candy paint
And got my nerve to ask myself I wonder why these niggaz at
I'm so street I love the beef ain't no way I'm endin it
So just in case it last long I bought me an extended clip
Three 6 my other click and DTP is who I love
I'm always hollerin bout that Dec cuz I'm in love wit where I'm from
So eastside throw it up rep ya side and let 'em know
Got plenty shells that I can give and ain't afraid to let 'em go
Hennessey and Hydro got a nigga gone dog
My muthafuckin lifestyle is more than just a song dog

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
I put the peddle to the medal then stop
Point it out the window boy a big ol plastic glock
Bullets richochetin man flyin through they car doe
Stoppin in they bodies and explodin cuz they hollows
Ballin off doin about a dollar and I got ghost
They was in a Regal I was in a Monte Carlo
Pissin on they CDs thought they really wanted beef
Now they back there bleedin from they head to they stanky feet believe it

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Playa pass me the green I'mma smoke it like a fiend
And I'm bout to pour some purple syrup and sip up on some lean
But its cool if you niggaz wanna take the weed and roooooll it
If you wanna buy the syrup and then poooour it
Don't be stingy wit the shit because I'm soooo legit
Ain't the type to take the weed and then hoooold it
Juicy J the type to lick a blunt and foooold it
You can come by my crib and get soooooo lit

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
