Somebody get the God Kane, I know he'll back you up
Kick a rhyme spectacular, I think the Nigga think he Blackula
I seen somebody trying to get him with sunlight
Somehow it wasn't done right, then he just laced him with one bite
Go for the jugular vein, that's my new thing
How did you do it with two fangs, think they were gold like Wu-tang
Your luck has been changed, you're left strucken with pain
Well good for your ass kid, that's what you get for fucking with Kane.
I creep on MC's like po' nine and take rhymes the whole nine
to dig in you rappers like a coalmine
Now look what I dug me, somebody better turn me off or try to unplug me
Ooh it's starting to get ugly
Don't miss this, hold on with a clenched fist
As I tongue the microphone down just like a French kiss.
Relentless with lyrics that be brutal, hip-hop I stay true to
Put it on you like voodoo

Chorus
Unda presha, niggas unfold and felt the heat
Possessed with the Brooklyn techniques we freak
Ay yo Kane, hit us off with that shit one time
They can't believe it, infatuated hardcore rhymes

Verse 2 
When you diggin' out your girl from behind, you're gonna find 
The reason that her eyes are closed, Black Caesar's on her mind 
Your royal smoothness, honeys out there know how it goes 
Even Cabesa de pollos that habla Español 
Dig this now, run for your life to get away but none do 
Even if you escape just tell me who can you run to 
Test the, stupendous, tell me what was you to gain 
Internal bleeding, due to Kane 
Boom bow bow, ooh, the pain 
Nobody's equal, keep it lethal, and diesel, to see to the people 
And reach your cerebral cause that's how we do 
The pain gets inflicted, fake MC's get evicted 
Face it, truth of the matter is just that I'm too hard to get with 
Since days of Pro Keds, I shined over mad heads, roll up on you like the Feds 
Rip your whole set to shreds 
A crash or a wreck, because I mash for respect 
Only thing I want to know now, is this cash or a check?              

Chorus

Verse 3
Ain't no question, 
I'm suffering a bad case of lyrical congestion 
Not the one for testing, 
come mess with and end up with your chest split 
No, not because of cardiac, but because how hard he act.               
I'm recognized as the microphone destroyer 
Competition minds in the state of paranoia 
I said if you're scared, get a dog 
So by tomorrow you'll probably see 20 rappers walking with Rotweilers 
Your gimmick is primitive, and impotent 
You won't win with it so limit it 
before I make your body start to hemorrhage 
Just when you thought that you was burning me 
You found yourself bleeding internally 
Now you heads is learning see
 I stay in there sincere,
You commence prayer,
Your heart begins fear, cause there ain't no wins here 
Never kid, even with leverage 
I can rock your headpiece worse than the wop ever did
I damage a amateur with a lack of stamina 
Petty grammar, leave you for the medical examiner 
You come talking bout some stay real 
I'll have you hitting high notes like Curtis,
 cause of pain that you may feel (Mayfield)
So many tried to infiltrate, but couldn't penetrate 
Now they disintegrate as money generate 
From who the living legend,  
True indeed, Hip- hop veteran, 
Whip ass is probably out there 
But I swear I never met him 
Gimme mine. </pre>
