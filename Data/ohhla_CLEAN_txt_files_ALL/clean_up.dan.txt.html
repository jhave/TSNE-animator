[Verse 1]
The thoughts all cloudy in the marijuana sky
But it started raining molly
It got me feeling sorry while I'm feeling on myself
Cause I don't know this bitch name
But I'm feeling on my breast
I know it ain't right, but in this state I don't care
A whole week done went past, I don't go no where
Hotel rooms crushing pills and menus
Daughter sending me messages saying "Daddy I miss you"
But in this condition I don't think she need to see me
Ain't slept in four days, and I'm smelling like seaweed
Problems in my past haunt my future and the present
Escaping from reality got me missing my blessings
Sent a couple g's but that make it no better
And now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy trying to get all together
Been stressing so long think depression done settled

[Chorus: x2]
It's time for me to clean it up
I came to far to fuck it up like...

[Verse 2]
Pops left mom when I was only 18
So rightfully that meant I had to be the man of things
And by 28 mom was damn near homeless
And now I'm 31 she 'bout to fucking cop her own shit
Triple beam dreams brought me nothing but nightmares
Thought that I was helping but the system don't fight fair
Cases had me locked up,
Mama always wrote me
Pops my only visit, they the only ones that loved me
That's why I feel bad, popping Givenchy tags
Knowing that this tee could feed my nephew for a week
For material I'm weak, acting like I don't care
I spend it all on clothes, then something is wrong there
I sent my mom some g's, but that makes it no better
Cause now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy trying to get all together
Been stressing so long think depression done settled

[Chorus]</pre>
