[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Whoo! Yeah yeah, excuse me
Is that candy paint, is that candy paint?
Them Bone Boys is back! (time to set it, time time time to set it)
Cleveland (time time time to set it, time time time to set it)
Full Surface!
Keep rollin rollin rollin, hey hey hey
Keep rollin rollin rollin, hey hey hey
Keep rollin rollin rollin, keep
Keep rollin rollin rollin, ah-what you said now?
 
[Chorus: Swizz Beatz] + (Autumn Rowe)
(I-I-I-I-I lo-o-o-o-ove you)
My Impala sittin on them two-fo's
(I-I-I-I-I lo-o-o-o-ove you)
My Cutlass with them suicide do's
Move, out my way; move, out
We make 'em move, out my way; move, out my way (loooooooooooove)
Wait a minute now, for a second now
Wait a minute now - ride on 'em, ride on 'em!
 
[Krayzie Bone]
Here come granddaddy always classy, ain't no nigga badder than that
They know I'm gangsta, 20-K Vogues on my black Cadillac
And as a matter of fact I flipped it and dipped it in some candy paint 
Suckers get mad cause they can't, can't
 
[Layzie Bone]
Your boy Lil Layzie comin though all in that black Monte Carlo
I'm switchin lanes, dippin lanes, like it ain't no tomorrow
I'm tryin to, get around cars with no regards for this traffic
Look how I yank it, yeah I yank it makin it look like it's magic
 
[Wish Bone]
If you see that dash strong you know what to do
You know what to do, you know what to do
Cleveland freeway rollin like it ain't we roll, our block and out we go
Watchin for them po-po's mashin down that 71
 
[Chorus] w/ ad libs
 
[Wish Bone]
Stomp it, bash it with my 350 Rocket, Cutlass
White on white it's tight, from bumper to bumper can't touch it
For a little more juice I super-charged it, yeah his ride's tight
But ain't tight like mine cause we workin on different squads, hey
 
[Krayzie Bone]
When I swing my do's open (my do's open)
My niggaz out in Cleveland swing them do's open (swing them do's open)
Big rumps, big bumps, big trunks
Whylin as I take it to the other side, let's get high
Pimpin while I'm deep into my vibe, roll by
 
[Layzie Bone]
I'ma come with the cleanest
I ain't gon' be seen these niggaz don't know who the team is
I love it I breathe it, Swizz and Bone, nigga that's who we is (we is)
Whatever the purpose it's a Full Surface, what you call architects
Too hard to check, and if you don't move we startin shit
 
[Chorus] w/ ad libs
 
[Layzie Bone]
And since I, gotta have it nigga my weapon is automatic nigga
Nigga stepped his game up when he came up, shoulda thought about it nigga
Cause these 24 inches spinnin is usually good for makin they heads twirl
Travel with me nigga, while I journey this world, yup
 
[Krayzie Bone]
Switchin lanes (dippin) switchin lanes (dippin) 
Switchin lanes (dippin) switchin lanes lanes
We rollin through your hood like Bone, Thug
And I doubt if we ever need to gangbang it's because (cause)
 
[Chorus] w/ ad libs</pre>
