[Chorus]
Opportunity in my face so I can't sit back and not take advantage of it
Man I can hardly wait got a date with miss success
and I can't stand her up no they don't understand us cuz
they say we too material (material) but money make the world go (round and round [x3]) yeahh
they say we too material (material) but money make the world go (round and round [x3]) yeahh

Wait they dying to get the diamonds off my plate
the more I give the more they tryin to take
like I be serving you this evening got the nerve
to wonder how I eat cuz while you sleep-in ima wake
aw man what is yull saying
money long yull's in like an on ramp
young boss man I be with a lot of goons
that know how to aim but dat chopper stay on auto-tune
I paint a perfect picture for it
so you gon need your high definition cord
they say I made it cause there ain't a thing I cant afford
and car service get me to my plane before it begins to board
aye they think they hell I'm on a highway
cause I treat everyday like it's a Friday
my situation straight you looking sideways
on my grizzly cause my crime pays

[Chorus]
Opportunity in my face so I can't sit back and not take advantage of it
Man I can hardly wait got a date with miss success and I can't stand her up no they don't understand us cuz
they say we too material (material) but money make the world go (round and round [x3]) yeahh
they say we too material (material) but money make the world go (round and round [x3]) yeahh

Three cell phones no home number
the shit that I be will take you out your zone comfort
quiet when I'm home but mention me when I'm gone
schedule getting full I had to I had to sync it with my iphone
and I cant get out of plane mode
cause every time I turn around I wake up in a different time zone (different time zone)
not concerned with all the fame but want the world to know my name when I'm gone
so just give me the light
quiet on the set show me where the cameras at (where the cameras at)
I'm telling you I'm ready (telling you I'm ready)
no I'm telling you I'm ready (im telling you I'm readyy)

[Chorus]
Opportunity in my face so I can't sit back and not take advantage of it
Man I can hardly wait got a date with miss success and I can't stand her up no they don't understand us cuz
they say we too material (material) but money make the world go (round and round [x3]) yeahh
they say we too material (material) but money make the world go (round and round [x3]) yeahh</pre>
