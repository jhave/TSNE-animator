[Intro] [Mark Spitz Talking]
Long Beach stand up. It's your hometown boy Mark Spitz and uhhh...

Now I've been fucked up all night long
This henny in this drink I got is almost gone
And I've been doin' wrong my whole life long
So here's my song
Here's my song

[Chorus] [Mark Spitz] (Kanye West):
Five pounds of dro
Five rounds or mo'
Tore from the flo'
Two sets of hoes
K. West to go
(Okay no more for me
Okay one more for me)
[x2]

[Verse One] [Mark Spitz]
Let me talk on this
Let me walk on this
Mark Spitz extra clips of hollow tips
I'm full throttle with Chicago trips
Hit's model chicks without the bread
Moet bottles flip, I'm out my head
Yeah
Okay no more for me
One more for me
Send another round around for all my Gs
Quarterback in the streets
Throw a zip for three
Mr. MC on the beats that still spin when I freeze
In the city by the sea
Feel the breeze
Hot head, I got steel to squeeze
See easy
The west is on my back, K. West is on the track
Okay?
Now we fiend to get it jumpin' like the jacks
Dimes and hood rats, get down on the flo'
And pop that pussy till it's time to go

[Chorus]

[Verse Two] [Mark Spitz]
I came to the club with a gang of drugs
But I left from the club with a gang of bitches
Just got my pimp cup now my name is Bishop
In a money green suit, ice cane and lizards
The P chain still hangs but it's changed to Spitz
The blues always authentic gangsta shit
Now take this and run with it
Go have fun with it
But make sure you bring it back when you're done with it
Long Beach done don' it again
It's been ten
And we've been it since then as little kids
You niggas can't tell me shit on how to sell with this
I'm hot as hell, we don' it again
The west is on my back, K. West is on the track
Okay?
Now we fiend to get it jumpin' like the jacks
Dimes and hood rats, get down on the flo'
And pop that pussy till it's time to go

[Chorus]

[Verse Three] [Kanye West]
You at the bar tryin' to ask what that Hypno hit fo'
If you gotta ask that you can't afford to get mo'
Dawg, slow down you can't afford to sip Mo
Leave the club now, come back when you get doe
Many hoes, many many many many hoes
Centerfolds, especially I'm in the Go
Cadillac back to back, red, black to indigo
Tell me that ain't pimpin' yo
Especially they in a row?
Keep a least two, that can't keep they cool
Cause I stay G'd up like the first week of school
Broke girls, I take 'em to they section eight
Where I pass the dick around like a collect plate
White girls said, "La Di Da Di, we love to party"
And that bitch ain't broke so they means she sniff coke
And she only 17 so that mean she can't vote
So if you do anything that mean you can't quote

[Chorus]</pre>
