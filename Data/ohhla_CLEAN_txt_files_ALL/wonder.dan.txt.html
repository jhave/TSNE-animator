Song:   Wonderbread
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Danny Brown]
On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Mommy gave me a book of food stamps
Said go get some bread and a pop and come back
Walk out the door first thing I see
A dope fiend standing there looking at me
Standing right there in front of the porch
With a pipe in his hand and the other a torch
I kept on moving ain't worried bout that
But a block later heard "rat-tat-tat-tat"
Next, some niggas from over there shootin'
Dog I ain't blinked just kept it a-movin'
Block later up: What do I find?
A junkie ho, I laughed at her cryin'
Flaggin' up cars, gettin' her bread
Guess what I seen on the way to get bread

[Chorus x4: Danny Brown]

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Mommy gave me a book of food stamps
To go get some bread and a pop and come back
Get to the store, first thing I see
An Arab dude just starin' at me
Lookin' at me like I'm bout to steal
But really though dog, you need to go chill
Grabbed what I needed, left out the do'
Two little boys in front of the sto'
Fiends runnin' up, runnin' through alleys
I kept on movin' nobody looked at me
Course some niggas stomped on my head
All because they wanted the bread

[Chorus x3: Danny Brown]</pre>
