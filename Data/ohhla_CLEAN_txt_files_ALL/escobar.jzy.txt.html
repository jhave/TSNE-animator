Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Last night I had a dream
Pablo Escobar gave me 10 bricks
And then I showed up on the scene
Looking like I hit about 10 licks

What's up my friend? como te amo my name is Jeezo
I heard you had them whole white squares down to the Medow
Give me everyone of them bitches you got I get 'em off
We can sit back and split up the profit minus the cost
Right now I'm on my "get money" shit, no time to floss
Man I'm talking so much money in the room I'm getting lost
And you know we do it face to face not on the selling
If you want 'em send them shots of the sea just like on belly
And this bad bitch I got from the plug she snort the eight
Told that bitch you should be same as yourself bitch wipe your face
On the floor my columbian nigga I told 'em Cubo
Say you 'bout to drop me a hundred I need 2 more
All I fuck was mucho, wait, I'm talking sumo
I play them cards just like they go I'm talking uno
Go to sleep in the hood, woke up in that versace
With the feds outside it's snapping like paparazzi

[Chorus]
Last night I had a dream
Pablo Escobar gave me 10 bricks
And then I showed up on the scene
Looking like I hit about 10 licks

We make a million, spend a million life is a fairytale
If they catch me in the crew they gon' throw us in the jail
If I think that they ain't right then I ain't making a sale
Yuppy ya DEA, shit how can you tell?
You know I'm kicked back, just peeping the conversation
Nigga set me up, get me to die it be complication man
This why I stay on top of my game, my shit is smooth
You know we ain't playing no games, my niggaz rule here
If they get you in, you say that you won't I'm just that dude
If he ain't get stopped then you won't make in the news
You know this shit was boom in the day, I made a kill, nigga
I'm sick of trying countin' these millions fuck is the billions
Got money in the couch, money all up in the ceiling
That sick shit bitch all we need is peniciline
Think I need to slow down the weed, I lost count
Ran through the first three point 8 and passed out

[Chorus]
Last night I had a dream
Pablo Escobar gave me 10 bricks
And then I showed up on the scene
Looking like I hit about 10 licks </pre>
