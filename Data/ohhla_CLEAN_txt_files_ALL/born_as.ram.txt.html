[Zack de la Rocha]
The hills find peace, locked armed guard posts..
Safe from the screams of the children Born As Ghosts..
Gates guns and alarms, shape the calm of the dawn..
Peering down into the basin where death lives on..
When young run foaming at the mouth with hate..
When burning batons beat the freezing who shake..
Under the toxic sunsets they dine and toast..
Of walls deny the terror faced...by the children Born As Ghosts..

[Hook]
BORN AS GHOSTS!!
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word...)
BORN AS GHOSTS!!
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word...)
BORN AS GHOSTS!!
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word...)
BORN AS GHOSTS!!
(We're the children Born As Ghosts! BORN AS GHOSTS!!)

One book and forty ghosts stuffed in a room..
Ah, the school as a tomb..
Where home is a wasteland, taste the razor wire..
And thought is locked in the womb..
The tales that tear at the myth of the dream..
(Myth of the dream, myth of the dream)
A suffering that shocks the lives off the screen..
(Myth of the dream, myth of the dream)

[Hook]
BORN AS GHOSTS!!
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word...)
BORN AS GHOSTS!!
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word...)
BORN AS GHOSTS!!
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word...)
BORN AS GHOSTS!!
(We're the children Born As Ghosts! BORN AS GHOSTS!!)

BORN AS GHOSTS!!
[guitar riff]

[Hook]
BORN AS GHOSTS!!
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word...)
BORN AS GHOSTS!!
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word...)
BORN AS GHOSTS!!
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word...)
BORN AS GHOSTS!!
(We're the children Born As Ghosts! BORN AS GHOSTS!!)
