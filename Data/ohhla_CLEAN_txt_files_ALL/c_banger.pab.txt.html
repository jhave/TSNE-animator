What's the dealy my nigga
You feelin' this and all of my fellas pimpin' from the dirty south
Out here to South Central, North Carolina up in here
Y'all know what time it is, this rock the party
Pass me some Belvedere, pass me a mic up here
Take it to another level
Focus, turn that beat up, give me bass with my trebble
Give me space for my fellas, yeah
I brought the west coast, Aftermath staff to the cotton picking south baby, whoo
Baby Bubba, I done figured it out
I stole the blueprints from the motherfucking government house
Hurtin' 'em now, sit down nigga, tonin' it down
And I ain't held a nigga hand since my daddy ran out
What you know about not having to remix shit, aha
If you made the original hot you wouldn't have to do that
You mad at me, ain't y'all
I don't care, I ain't gon' change it, I'm real, I'm trill
And this a motherfucking club banger

We need a club banger (aha), we need a club banger (fa sho)
We need a club banger, ok yo, yo
I want a club banger (aha), I want a club banger (fa sho)
I want a club banger, ok yo, yo
We need a club banger (aha), we need a club banger (fa sho)
We need a club banger, ok yo, yo
I want a club banger (aha), I want a club banger (aha)
I want a club banger

Front page, read that boy, He done did it again
Petey cheese steaks up with all that vinegar man
Damn, how they went there, yeah
I thought you knew that
I bootleg my shit on the street and sell it myself
Why you think I'm always grinning
I stay a step ahead of these niggaz
Motherfucker I'm up on these niggaz
Ain't tryin' to use it either
Baby I done revvin' it up
I got a money bucket on me, and I'm a fill that bitch up
So what if I wanna buy another car, yeah
I wanna get another truck
Ice my whole shit up, I can pay cash for it
As long as y'all ask for it, I'm a show my ass on it
I don't keep many spastics till the man put the tag on it
Yeah, halt the class, Michael Jackson bag
Good as some Sunday dinner country corn bread
Dope like a west coast Cali hallway
Give it like you wanna get it
Ain't that what Dogg said, yeah

We need a club banger (aha), we need a club banger (fa sho)
We need a club banger, ok yo, yo
I want a club banger (aha), I want a club banger (fa sho)
