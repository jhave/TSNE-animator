[Wyclef]
I'm just about done...
Yo, let me finish tuning this guitar...
Yo, y'all ready for the show?

[Lauryn "L-Boogie" Hill (Chorus)]  (Wyclef in parentheses)
Ready Or Not!  (Yo!) - Wyclef
Here we come!  (Uh Huh)
All the biting M.C.'s and the pirates, I go run!  (Come on, come on)
(Why?)'Cause they are old!  
(And...) And we are young!
(Uh huh...and)  And while we're young, yes we're gonna have some fun!  (Yo!)
(Here it comes)  Here we go!
Skippity bop bop bop, skippity whoa!!  Swing!  (Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo!)
Skippity bop bop bop, skippity WHOA!!!  SWING!!  (Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!)

[Wyclef]
You should've have died before you reach this station, Refugees we run the
border!
Ay! Ay!...Ay! Ay!
You should've have died before you reach this station, Refugees we all go
murder!
Now!!!

[Wyclef]

Yo!  Now that I escape, selling four million plates
My beeper vibrates, like California earthquakes
But I keep a balanced head, 'cause you're hot, they're not
M.C.'s go Hollywood, then lose their spot on the jukebox
Still ichi bang, wack M.C.'s get the gong!
Lyrical tongue
Wireless mics from Samsung
Wyclef, seduced once by an actress
Angela Basset wanted the head of Jean Baptiste
Meanwhile across town, I steal no money to Carlito
Mama always say don't gamble
I'm trapped in casino
No more money in my bags
Nightmares, getting closer
I slept on Elm Street, Freddy Kruger
Woke up with a German Luger
Black serial killer, man turns to gorilla
Provoked I change faces like Michael Jackson's Thriller
B-B-B-B-B-Boo! (Imitating young Michael Jackson)
And you don't stop!!!

[Chorus 1x]

[Wyclef]
Yo, L-Boogie where you at?

[Lauryn]
I'm just adjusting my mic

[Wyclef]
Come on, yo L-Boogie where you at?!

[Lauryn]
I'm just adjusting my mic!

[Wyclef]
Yo, L-Boogie where you at? Come on!

[Lauryn]
I'm just adjusting my mic!

[Wyclef]
Well won't ya, grab the mic and lead the blind to the light?!

[Lauryn]
If I could change the times, make rhymes, raise the babies
Give all the pigs rabies
Send biting niggas to Haiti's
Clothe young ladies
Chase the rainbow, find the pot
Free the third time offender once he learns to makes-a-lot
Lose the fame
Take the money
Play boys, just like the bunny
Find a man with a plan
Slap a chicken, If she acts funny
Break the bank, on tank
Stop niggas from acting stank
Take over your vouch free Rovers
Teach a man to find Jehovah
Own the stores, own the tours
Watch the record, pimps and whores
Make love, stop the wars
Cop the land, like the laws
Make the last be the first
Make the God respect the Earth
Change the murder rate to the birth! (Swing!)

[Chorus 1x]

[Wyclef]
Hey yo, Pras where you at?

[Prakazrel "Pras"]
I'm just adjusting my mic

[Wyclef]
Yo!  Hey yo, Pras where you at?!

[Pras]
I'm just adjusting my mic!

[Wyclef]
C-C-Come on, yo Pras where you at?!!

[Pras]
I'm just adjusting my mic!

[Wyclef]
Well won't ya, grab the mic and make the crowd react!

[Prakazrel "Pras"]
No more tours, no more scores
Por favor senor, I do the soundbite from here to El Salvador
Ready to take over, Like that! (Gun cocks)
Run your whole crew over, Like that!! (Gunshot)
Buffalo soldier!  Dreadlock rasta! (Lauryn in background)
Rather be slaughtered, than be captured!
Three refugees, one usual suspect
Trapped in the firm, 'cause he fell to two techs
Prospects have thoughts, blood in like outlets
I can read your whole flow, just like a pamphlet
Thousands and thousands of watts
High volt!
Body as a Q-Tip, right on the asphalt
Tell the truth that you shouldn't sky off
This is Mr.  Prakazrel, I don't take it as an insult
I grab the money, money!
Stash the cash-n-dash, peddle on the gas
I'm clear like Everlast! (Never seen a refugee movin' so fast!) - Salaam
Now catch me in Jamaica
Chillin' at the break of sunsplash!

[Chorus 1x]

[Lauryn]
(Ooo-wee!)    To Queens
(Ooo-wee!)    To New Jersey
(Ooo-wee!)    To Brooklyn
(Ooo-wee!) ...and Uptown
(Ooo-wee!) ...and Long Island
(Ooo-wee!) ...Staten Island
(Ooo-wee!) ...U.C. (University of Columbia)
(Ooo-wee!) ...Miami!
(Ooo-wee!) ...To Jamaica!

[Fades out]
