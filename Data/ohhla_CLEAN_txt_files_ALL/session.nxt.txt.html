[Grap Luva]
Yeah, 7th letter, alongside The Nextmen
"Just think"   "Thinkin' how can we exist through the facts"
Yeah, this is the thinking man's session
"Just think"   "Thinkin' how can we exist through the facts"
7 Heads, scenario, yo
 
I coincide with the rhythm causing y'all to listen
To real rap lessons, up in this Nextmen session
Transatlantic crews a part of the plan
Giving rule agreed by 7 Heads and one man
Now collecting grands, by supply and demand
Lessen dub plates, ripping shows in foreign lands
Pure potency, the way the people know it's me
Great rhyme attributes, positive emcee
Check out my melody, I'm the wigger's worst enemy
But I stick to my regiment, cause I'm heaven-sent
What I represent, should be beats and write rhymes
In these times like the sun, yo, I rise and shine
Prepare for combat with rediculous raps
Perhaps these cats don't understand I'm still the fan
So if the shit's hot, my support you've got
But if not, bring it back to the lab and don't stop
The session
 
(Chorus)
I don't write rhymes, I scribe the words of life
Use the truth like a knife when combating the strife
Learning lessons is therapeutic like counting blessings
A true confession, this is the thinking man's session
"Just think"   "Thinking how can we exist through the facts"
Yeah, this is the thinking man's session
"Just think"   "Thinking how can we exist through the facts"
 
Round two, yo, check it
I give thanks to the most high for giving me eyes 
To recognize the truth from lies cause in a world of demise
I shed light and supply mental ammo
Simply cause I figured out your plan, so
Now ya know, here's one young blood that ain't snoozing
Nothing's amusing when it's a war that we're losing
Sides are chosen, their minds are unfrozen
Prepare for combat with the spook who sat
Very close to the door, watching cats deplore
Weak flows that they possess sound like folklore
Leaving these people bored, and we won't have that
Leave it strong like tree roots, and stay in cahoots 
With those keeping the vibe right, cause we just might
Elevate the mind state, eliminate all trife
Situations, destruction to the false ones
They left the job undone, now it's time for some
Brothers who are true to what they do to come through
Bringing in original tracks and real raps
Snapping the backs of the fraudulent and in fact
Those loving wicked actions shouldn't look for protection
Disrupt the session, wouldn't consider it clever
Me fearing you for words, I say never
It's much more serious than that
I bust those real rhymes, nevermind them dime-store raps
Up in the session
 
(Chorus)
 
Cut it up
"Thinking all complex"  "Let me tell you what it's all about"
"Thinking all complex"  "Maybe you better work it out"
"Do it again"
"Thinking all complex"  "Let me tell you what it's all about"
"Thinking all complex"  "Maybe you better work it out"
"Because I'm kickin' it"
 
Unh, Nextmen (Nextmen) on the scratch
Grap Luva on the ill dispatch
Big up to my man Wes, 7 Heads, Big Ed
Scenario, know what I'm saying
from New York to London this how we layin' it down
Pete Rock, you know you foundation
Heavy D, you know you foundation
To all my family, you know you foundation
All my bredren, we foundation
Strictly thinking yo  
Use ya head</pre>
