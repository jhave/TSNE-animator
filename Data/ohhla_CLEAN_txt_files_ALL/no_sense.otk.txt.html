Typed by: sinistaboy@yahoo.com

Man y'all play too much
Now now Percival, don't fret
We're here to help you *laughs*
I told you to bring good songs... what are you gonna do now?
Look at the keys... well... you gotta do something
Keep your eyes on the keys... here's looking at you kid *laughs*
Okay okay... well... make up somethin... yeah right
You won't make sense... I don't know lets try it
Here we go *clears throat*

[Chorus]
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all

[Verse 1]
ABC, 123, Do-re-mi, out of key
(you got that right)
Out of touch, out of tune, butterknife, tea spoon
(now what was that)
Razz-a-matazz, Thing-a-majig, whatchamacallit, bullshit
So and so, such and such (bullshit!) pretty much
(I think I'm gonna throw up)

[Chorus]
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all (blah blah blah blah)
Makes no sense at all (blah blah blah blah)
Makes no sense at all (blah blah)

[Verse 2]
1 and 1 makes 2, 2 and 2 makes 4, 4 and 4 makes 8 and 8 makes 16
16 and, 16 makes (32 Percival)
Ahh makes no sense at all
Who needs lyrics anyway (ummm... YOU!)

[Bridge]
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?

(during bridge) (bridge continues throughout)
Hey! Hey little buddy where you going?
Come back man! We was just playin! Come on man!
See I pissed him off
