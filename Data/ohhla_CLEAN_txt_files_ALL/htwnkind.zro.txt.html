You know we riding slab, with that candy paint
Dripping off the frame, down 2-88
Sipping purple Sprite, mack a broad tonight
This is how we play each and every day, it's a H-Town kinda day
 
[Z-Ro]
We don't ride 3's, only 4's
With alligator seats, same thang on my toes
If she ain't a dime, she ain't one of my hoes
Since they go up in the sky, I call em heavenly do's
If the interior peeling, you ain't riding with Ro
Wood flo's sliding do's, I know you wanna roll
Screwed Up Click until it's over, I put that on my soul
Black candy paint and swangas, cause your nigga so cold
It's the high life, I don't need no dro
Spending money chasing a high, niggaz can't keep no dough
Rather spend it on some swangas, and a fresh set of 4's
Twenty sets of those, ain't even what I see at my shows
Back in the day, me and Thugger had beef together
Now we Bentley back to back, we share the streets together
Gon' be alligator, under my ass cheeks forever
Candy wet as a sherm head, it's gon' leak forever

Thug boss, show up and show out
It's Sunday in the city, time to pull the load out
I hit up my Hoggs, time to pull out them dogs
Swerving side to side, ain't worried bout them laws
Smoking on that Cali topless, broads bopping
Chunking deuces up, but I ain't stopping
Paint dripping, no mo' purp sipping
Boys getting knocked up for drank, y'all tripping
No cases, I'm with the bad bitch with the braces
Bout to head back, to one of my places
Give a thug love, then I might hit up the club
No VIP, I'm at the bar posted up
Pocket full of money, laughing at them dummies
Too drunk to notice, that I'm leaving with they honies
Thug's life, yeah that's how the Boss play
Different chick different day, down here we say

[Z-Ro]
Mayonnaise and mustard, that's how I roll
I bet you never seen a black Bentley, on 4's
Yeah the 300 got suicide, and Lamborghini do's
Like the wipers watermelon, that my pimping get chose
Six by nine's, like Kirk Franklin wire
You say I don't look clean in this thang, you a liar
Huh, wood grain what I'm holding on
And y'all already know, what I'm rolling on
Swangas, swangas, swangas
S-W-A-N-G-E-R
These are the gorilla pokers, these ain't bars
If you ain't got em on your ride, it's just another car
When we riiide
North East West and Southsiiiide
Couldn't be a buster, if I tried
H-Town niggaz, so liiiive
