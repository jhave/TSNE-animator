It's how it goes down
Hoodsta style
The Remix
West Coast killin like that! (One Shot Kill)
Y'all know what's crackin
The whole Roc-A-Fella shut down!

Enemy's goals come at me foul
I bust 'em in they bowels
For this rag 4 mag, bitch get shit bag
Watch me hit this fag with sack with this
Till I die "Crip or Cry" Mista Nice Guy's dead
Is in hood to the heart and his .47 to the head
Think you can scrap? I got scrap
But see it's only one thing, I got this strap
And they ain't goin for none of that
Comprehend like "You don't just wanna end your career here"
When the bullet hits your collarbone you know it's like "Fuck a career"
I drink a  ?? to ya soul, muthafucka rich roll
Hit you and ya man, you slippin, fuck up his stroll
Cuz, and that's just how these hoodstas roll
Talkin 'bout "Is he a blood or is he crip?"
Nigga I sock that faggot in his big ass lip
Put a straight jacket on me, cuz I'm throwin a tantrum
And all the crips across the world y'all gone sing this anthem

[Crip Chorus: Jayo]
We stay trued up! Blued up!
True fat laces, true blue chucks
We Crippin till we die cuz, and'll shoot you up
Cock the .38 from the G homie used to shoot up

[Blood Chorus: Baby Star]
We stay flamed up! Banged up!
Bright red laces, flamed up chucks
It's Piru till we die blood, and'll shoot you up
Cock the .38 from the G homie used to shoot up


[Baby Star]
Dulo, get names spit flames
Thought cus Pac laid off ya shit change?
Shit ranged, hell naw they bit game
Every time ya hit, bitch slang
Bit names, bustin other niggas shit can

You crossed the line blood, now the streets comin to get ya
It's over +H.O.V.A.+ prepare for your last thrill nigga
Was never a real nigga and know you aint tryin to be
Dulo the throne of dynasty
Thinking your reigning? It's time to see
We'll find you at Marcy unless you wit a film crew
With that scary ass Memphis Bleek nigga him too
I aint impressed that you done wrote your fuckin flunky some raps
But if Beanie is really a baboon then you funky for that
But it aint no dynasty dummy, just ya flunky and a monkey
And a broad that look like a fuckin recoverin heron junky
Put a straight jacket on me dog, I'm throwin a tantrum
And all my Bloods across the world y'all gon sing this anthem

[Blood Chorus: Baby Skar]
We stay flamed up! Banged up!
Bright red laces, flamed up chucks
It's Piru till we die blood, and'll shoot you up
Cock the .38 from the G homie used to shoot up

[Crip Chorus: Jayo]
We stay trued up! Blued up!
True fat laces, true blue chucks
We Crippin till we die cuz, and'll shoot you up
Cock the .38 from the G homie used to shoot up

[Jayo Felony]
Back in the day if I was 'caine cuz I would have been trippin
Like "Ain't no half crippin"
When it comes to this C shit, they gon' learn out here
I'll have Al Sharp, C-walkin with his perm out here
Niggas bangin the NY now, cuz I don't knock it
This fool said he was a blood but had his rag in the wrong pocket
Crips where it on the left and Pirus where it on the right
I'ma show you muthafuckas how to gangbang right
Ride back in the same night, how to slang 'caine right
How to keep them guns hot, and aim them thangs right
While ya DJ gettin sloped at the break beach spot
I'm smoking purple till my lungs light great street watts
C-walk on yo roof, it's over before you hit the vocal booth
Watch out, I threw up the hood and broke ya tooth
Put a straight jacket on me, cuz I'm throwin a tantrum
And all the crips around the world y'all gone sing this anthem

[Crip Chorus: Jayo](2x)
We stay trued up! Blued up!
True fat laces, true blue chucks
We Crippin till we die cuz, and'll shoot you up
Cock the .38 from the G homie used to shoot up

Bitch!
And you just lost!</pre>
