living in mediaspace 1 azure, foofwa, and i are living in media space. the
air is filled with electromagnetic discharge, cooling fans create a dis-
turbing hum, wires snake through the room, we're in the midst of the mach-
ine, the belly of it. living in mediaspace 2 there's no escape; the sound
and radiation continues through the night, matched only by the bleak sun-
rise and furnace roar, one toppling the other, the other toppling the one.
living in mediaspace 3 it's here we create our body movements, over and
over again, the irony of heavy labor in within the virtual, as we become
aware of big iron, even in the smallest appliance - of the need for clean
and proper protocols, as our body becomes increasingly filthy. living in
mediaspace 4 century-and-a-half old brick walls, wooden floors, skylight
and energy, wooden tables, several miles of tables, interoperability among
machines ranging from yesterday to forty years ago, analog and digital
regimes snaking into each other, patchcords and internal proprieties of
memory; we're here, turning knobs, pulling levers, plugging and unplugging
cords and cables, moving tripods, focusing cameras, aiming lights, speak-
ing, singing, walking, dancing, playing, theorizing, discussing, eating,
sleeping, excreting, shuddering, washing, dressing, typing, aligning, re-
aligning, transforming input to output, output to input, looping through
interruptions of storage media, replaying, rehearsing, recuperating. liv-
ing in mediaspace 5 my hands move across the six strings of the electric
guitar; they're not moving fast enough; when my fingers blur - then i know
something is working - something is laboring properly - the output roars
into being. living in mediaspace 6 intermittent taking of digital photo-
graphs through the obdurate regime of the real: everything returns to the
virtual; we're leaving our traces. living in mediaspace 7 thus tracing our
cords - where does this one or that one go - following the line snaking
among hundreds of others to the obverse side, interior, of the device or
patchbay: they go on with three switches half-buried among distribution
amplifiers and sync generators. living in mediaspace 8 the day is ready
when the machines are ready; some remain on, alert and vigilant through
the night; some sleep uneasily; some keep their clocks right on time. liv-
ing in mediaspace 9 we are sure to be activated; there's no uncertainty;
the bricks glow with data bombardment; we're becoming suffused; there's
not a moment to lose; the machines are waiting, tapes and disks running;
other storage media as well; there's always flash memory, wetware; the
room pulses to a single sync; you can almost hear us living in mediaspace
10; you can almost hear us breathing

synthesizer again for vocal switching, media21, while i'll play back the
live mirage sound recorded on the sony professional cassette player, not
dat, but with good plugin powered mikes, through the onkyo deck, while 
azure and i are working naked, shaved, elsewhere, dreams reflecting off
bodies against brilliant difficult dance taken from nikuko parable texts
and the problematics, media22, of ballet

we've finished fifteen pieces in three days. music sources include moog
and mirage, electric guitar and voice, shakuhachi and harmonica. video
processing includes adobe premier, an old titling program on an amiga, and
the analog video synthesizer. other media include the usual computer prog-
rams and everything's checked on the g4. shooting sites include a wildlife
refuge about two miles from here, as well as the interior of the loft.
other work produced includes about 45 digital photographs and a number of
texts. there are several strands to all of this - working with the nikuko
parables, working with a critique and sexualization of ballet, and working
through systems of signs and the body. for once the intensity has remained
through everything; we play back through premier, but also on cdrom, and
we're finding ourselves constantly astounded. the space and architecture
of the loft seem liquid, mobile; the movements and cameras are determining
the reading of worlds, not proscenia. the pieces are also fragmenting;
there may be several versions of each, and we don't choose between them
but keep them all.

burning them into cdroms which are write-once only gives them the perman-
ency of sculpture, of inert materiality, the grain of the planet. it's as
if we're there on-disk online re-enacting or recuperating the same move-
ments and the same firewalls against death, as ever; we're caught, to be
played backwards and forwards, repeatedly. you can see this in the seman-
tics of the work itself; one of the pieces is a parable scrolling in re-
verse, from top to bottom; through several loopings, the meaning, the time
of it all, become clear. last night i dreamed of my mother again, with the
same narratology - there is a traumatic interruption announcing her death,
that she is death; i wake somewhat later, almost in tears.  look at this,
this looping in wetware under constant mismanagement; it is inconstancy
which harbors memory, not the truth burned into microscopic tracks. it
takes the pure light of a laser to read them.

there seems to be a truth in nudity in all of this, something neither
machine nor inscription can touch. it's as if what's signified - the pre-
sentation of the naked sexualized body - converts only ikonically - that
is, through representation, into itself, looped through the viewer, who
completes the real. while foofwa is dancing, is a dancer, azure and myself
stumble or present differently, and the difference draws dancer and danc-
ing in; the fictivity of the dance is subverted by the labor and body of
the dancer, and everything reaches or lathers around or through the same
knot.

look at this, look at this, look at this.

Bridging


from Albert A. Bennett, The Interpolational Polynomial, in Bennett, Milne,
and Batement, Numerical Integration of Differential Equations, 1931.

"If, as often happens in engineering problems, a function is adequately
given by two separate simple algebraic formulas over adjoining parts of
the range, a single polynomial of low order may afford a poor method of
representing the situation even approximately. Thus if one is given the
table," [Which can be summarized: As x takes successive values from -5 to
5, y successively equals 0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,4,5.] "then, by the use of a
single polynomial, the value assigned to y at x = -6 is zero if one uses
only the data from x = -5 to x = 0 inclusive. Using all the given data,
however, one obtains y = 126 at x = -6. Similarly one obtains y = 798 at x
= -7. Similarly one has for x = 6 y by the polynomial the value 132. These
'unreasonable' values are not confined to the results of extrapolation.
The polynomial gives as the value of y at x = -4.5 the number -22. In
examples of this sort, the engineering practice of using an 'easement' or
'transition' curve or 'bridging formula' over a critical region without
regard to distant portions of the table is to be recommended for purposes
of graduation or subtablation, if the evidence seems to justify a smooth
graph. If a concentrated irregularity is to be preferred, interpolation
formulas should be applied to the two sides of the break separately,
ascending differences being used above the break, descending, below."

This very critical example is intimately tied to the bundling of heuris-
tics used in practice and salvaging natural law, described by Nancy Cart-
wright in How the Laws of Physics Lie. I often use the example of x =
0,1,2,3,4,... and y = 0 except for, say, x = 84927, when y = 1. This may
be the case on one hand with noise or random error; on the other, the
ratio is meaningful - generates meaning - in particle physics experiments.
(The whole phenomenology of meaning in relation to theory, organism, anom-
aly, and domain is at work here.)

Given the latitude of the real, in other words, meaning and interpretation
are found at the heart of facticity. Although this is clearly evident in
postmodernity studies, it's interesting to find it treated as a minor but
prevalent problem, circumscribed as 'bridging,' in 1931.

Think of it this way. There is no bridge, no gap; within the bridge or
gap, meaning is generated - and it is meaning which has generated (the
perception of) the bridge or gap as well. Resident in organsim, meaning is
the weighted, cathected, intended real. Think of it this way: the real as
shamed, smudged, spoiled - therein lies the boundary, culture and civil-
ization as well. The bridge as bridging transcendentals is problematic;
the bridge as meaning's interstice provides space and place for signifier
and signification.

It's the mouth. It's always the mouth.

We already have a good perspective on the twentieth century. It was a cen-
tury of mechanized iron, of massive wars resulting from global imperiali-
sms. It was a century of burgeoning electrical, then electronic, communi-
cations, a century of entertainments and the fragmenting of grand narra-
tives - national and otherwise. It was a century of amazing scientific
progress, and the exploration of the farthest reaches of the earth. It was
a century of terrorisms and bombs, the century in which the population
crises and world-wide pollution appeared catastrophic for the first time

It was a century in which we began to grasp the foundations of physical
reality and the foundations of biological existence, and it was a century
of knots and the problematizing of closed classical systems of logics,
mathematics, and everything else. It was a century in which the idea of
space and lived and inhabited space became worrisome. It was a century of
images, the imaginary, and anguish

Report of a talk


I gave a talk to a few of McKenzie Wark's students and others and stumbled
through the entire thing, the result of no sleep and even for the first
time an inability to focus; I felt sick. But I did manage to talk about -
taking off from Anthony Wilden's work of a few decades ago - the radical
moment we live in, a moment in which the digital regime begins to replace
the analogical. I talked about, apologizing all the while for exhaustion,
the relation of the analogical to deep identity, identity all the way
down, and the digital in relation to skittered surface equivalences - and
the differences between the two. Equivalence has no original; entities are
defined by attributes and solely by attributes, as if what it does in any
particular case, any other within the regime does in any particular case.
But from identity, nothing can be determined... I spoke about tolerances
as well as facticity - a tree represented by a single pixel in relation to
another pixel representing a second tree, the pixels equivalent - and what
that says about the identity of the referent, if anything. Half falling
over, I briefly described Tarski's work on truth (it was Tarski who cri-
tiqued Spencer Brown's Laws of Form, which I discussed briefly afterwards)
- as well as truth both in terms of deep identity (bringing in Saul Krip-
ke's theory of rigid designators, natural kinds, and possible worlds), and
equivalences - skittered and situational truths requiring almost a Tertul-
lian to look for grounding in absurdity - the alternative being proto-fas-
cism. I spoke about mediaspace as well, a combination of analog and dig-
ital regimes of projections and introjections. I talked about language as
performativity, and the different phenomenologies of linux prompts on one
hand and microsoft windows systems on the other - areas of the screens de-
fined as potentials, closed source vs. open source software (appliance and
structural/configurable models), and using programs as catalysts for writ-
ing. Utterly exhausted and swimming in seminar space, I spoke about the
Book/Ends conference in Albany I had recently attended, and how the mourn-
ful attitude of the Derrideans towards the book was based on notions of
deep truth and identity; it was this identity regime that was becoming in-
creasingly problematized, as evident from intellectual property issues,
privacy issues, censorship issues, and so forth, online. I also talked
about the media people at the conference, and their feeling of exclusions
- as well as excitement over working and skittering across borders and
protocols, working towards planetary distribution systems. I talked about
how the media people talked a lot about protocols and techniques and shar-
ing these things, all of which are, like intensely situated truths, skit-
tered equivalences, interoperabilities in computer terms. So that it was
in a sense an entire older vision of the humanities, of human-ism, that
was at stake here. Almost entirely asleep, the outline from the pda so
blurred I couldn't read it, I spoke about translations of analog into dig-
ital and digital into analog, and the notions of generations in videotape
- analog lasting with 3/4" for example maybe five generations at the most,
while digital can last thousands, with intensely slow accumulations of
errors, since the potential well - the plateau of writing - was much high-
er than the level of random noise (very high signal to noise ratio). I
spoke as well about fluidity, and the influence Brossard, Irigaray, and
Kristeva have had on my work, and how on one hand one might consider flu-
idity as a fundamental characteristic of the internet, and, on the other,
there are also hackers and others who find the net a domain of potential
and totalized power, not fluid at all but penetrable, able to be violated,
controlled. Stumbling near the equipment table, I mumbled about gender on
internet relay chat, and some of Nikuko's activities there. Nearly sound
asleep and shaking with exhaustion by this point, I concluded by reading
two texts from the mediaspace series. After dinner with a few people, I
returned with Azure to the media center. Foofwa has already left on a bus
and we continue here, living in mediaspace 67, for a few more days. I
write, still shaking, into the night. Azure is asleep. I think about fun-
damental ontologies and their relationship to the analogical and identity
- which I also talked about, deep ontologies - and problematized epistem-
ologies of digital partial-domains always already undergoing reconnection
- always already surface and skittered. Tonight I'll read in bed again,
trying once more to make everything whole, or at least livable for anoth-
er day. Tomorrow, I'll send this out.

68, azure reading, walking through the field
69, azure reading, walking down the path at a distance
79, azure reading, walking down the path a shorter distance
80, azure reading, approaching the camera from a shorter distance
81, azure reading, closer, walking down the path in winter 
82, azure reading, in the woods near a small gorge, trees, streams, rocks
83, azure reading, walking by forked trees by the side of the gorge
84, azure reading, partially hidden by trees by the side of the gorge
85, azure reading, walking along a circular forest path
86, azure reading, turned slightly closer along the circular forest path
87, azure reading, walking by trees uprooted near a frozen marsh
88, azure reading, walking from a distance in the forest
89, azure reading, walking, bundled up, reading and walking

the great forest towers above azure, azure is reading in the great forest
the frozen marsh surrounds azure, azure is reading in the frozen marsh

90, reading of this world and another one before one's very eyes
91, reading of other worlds, and this one before one's very eyes

i will stop death by placing a tiny pebble in front of me
i will stop death's hard breathing by placing a small rock
i will stop death's approach by placing another stone
i will stop death's reading and writing by placing a boulder
a hill and a mountain, i will stop death in its tracks
a mountain and a planet, i will stop death's hard breathing

-

among them or before them all, azure, a wild reading
a wild breathing, swaying, you can't hear a thing
azure's screaming worlds, and words won't come
azure's screaming words, and worlds won't come

-

death, forestall us in the forest, hinder our uneasy ways
death, caress us against moving grids and cyclones, turn our images
turn our images away from ourselves, the world erupts in desire
desire burns through the world, death save us, protect us, caress us

-

in the forest, walking across the tiniest leaves
the motions of light delicately walking and exploring the interior
of a camera

-

92, azure walking in the forest, reading
93, azure reading in the forest, walking

Crying of Wolf


Nikuko cried wolf when she yammered about being dismembered. Alan cried
wolf when he cried and scratched himself over deep depression. Jennifer
cried wolf over virginity and Julu cried wolf over Nikuko. Nikuko cried
wolf over murder and mayhem. Alan and Jennifer cried wolf over the spil-
ling of blood. Over and over again, the quartet cried wolf over rape and 
wound, death and annihilation, destruction and castration, the cutting- 
off of limbs, scraping-out of eyes, tearing-off of ears and tongues.

Nothing happened to the quartet as they cried wolf over and over again.
Then one day ...

Folg mich! Nikuko is my shtik! Emmis! I wanna shtup her all the time, she
says I'm a piece of drek, the gonif. Shush, she'll here you, I don't care,

fighting space

so far on one cdrom, edited, re-edited w/sorenson compression, mp3, etc.:
40 minutes music
500 images (gif, jpeg, bmp)
40-50 small programs
18 video pieces totaling about an hour
5000 pages print
5-6 flash pieces (collaborations all; i can't work flash myself)
2 websuites
40 articles
my own website which includes the pages print above as well as:
 dhtml and javascript work
 2 vrml pieces

still 25 megabytes left. you go from original video thru belkin to avi 
and from that to sorenson quicktime at 33%, audio kept 16 bit but 11k
at the top which does a good job getting rid of hiss.

original video shooting on hi8 and dv, edited on premier and soundforge.  
html stuff on dream weaver, hand type, netscape, corel. still images on
everything from alchemy through 2 photoshops, psp, display, corel, gimp,
about 25 other programs. polypore images direct from nikon 800. program
images originally run in qbasic. texts made in pico, as well as 3 ascii
editors from thailand, emacs, dos editor, and dana, among others. text
programs from display, perl, ti59 programming (years ago), and the various
small apps in /usr/games for linux/unix. music with moog, shakuhachi, wes-
tern flute, electric guitar, mirage; the guitar feeds through an effects
box to a small marshall amp which simulates tube design.

work stems anywhere from early 70s (pascal programming) through the most
recent double residency at the experimental television center, which pro-
duce most of the recent videos. cameras used were sony hi 8s and dvs, as
well as numerous smaller cameras, including some panasonics and quick-cams
- about 13 cameras in all. the residency was with foofwa d'imobilite and
azure carter; we produced about 100 images, 20 videos, couple of hours of

brief note

from Nikuko - "I can drive the voices out of my head temporarily by asking
them to shut up, be quiet; sometimes this leads to more and more chatter
as one objection after another is offered. It's exhausting. Sometimes
there's a break of a few seconds, though, during which I regain strength,
inhabit silence, rest. I almost beg them. I'll whisper to them, as if that
would make any difference. They go on about all sorts of things. They in-
sist they have nowhere else to talk. Usually it's about trivia - things to
do, events of the day, the latest gossip, revenge scenarios. I've tried to
take more control - I really have. If I start singing, one or another of
them takes over, and that's no help. I wonder who's making the requests;
I desperately need sleep, not these incessant voices ..."

Interference Theory of Dis-ease


    The curtain rises.

    She walks to the front of the stage

    She bows. She begins to speak.

There is no girl in my life. I watch you carefully. I learn from you. At
night I'm sleepless. I want to focus on theory. I want to write philoso-
phy. Instead, the sheets are trampled beneath me. I wake sweating with
uneasy dreams. Without theory I am lost. Without you, I am more than lost;
your limbs break my hypothesis. I am obsessive-compulsive. I follow you
everywhere, I inhale you. Your scent surrounds me. I dream of your cast-
off clothing. 

    She bows. She speaks again.

The boys tease me; I don't pay attention. They're not in my dreams. I am
writing an essay; I am writing about ontology, about epistemology - I am
talking to you. What is there to understand? I use the metaphor of eating
- I want to devour you, devour everything about you. Wanting is like brea-
thing; to want is to be wanton, think of nothing but you. It interferes,
this metaphor - your body outlined in the window-light. I can't speak
well, this emotion has surrounded me.

    She bows. She speaks again.

Breathing is a kind of focusing. My nakedness is a gift; I write, always,
naked. Ontology collapses in waves against the body; sight pries open the
darkest secrets. This is the job of the philosopher and the lover; there
is no differance. You duplicate yourself repeatedly; you are everywhere,
shuddering within the fragile domains of objects, outlined against stones,
trees, cars, radios, men and women. Are fantasies theories, theories fan-
tasies? Are we knowing? Are we better people?

    She bows. She speaks again.

I want to devour, want wanton, to devour more than ever, inhale flesh and
cloth, hair and necklace, nail and effluvia, eyes and thinking that makes
us human, against all techne, against all odds. It is my obsequious priv-
ilege, my humiliation, to devour. You show yourself to me; that is, you
walk in newer clothes. I show myself to you, naked and broken, written by
theory, writing you, writing theory.

    She bows. She speaks again.

I am afraid of nothing I devour. I am fearful of theory, of my dreams of
theory, of my theory of dreams, of your dreams. Thank you for listening.

    She bows.

    The curtain falls.

Calligraphic


Calligraphy fascinates because it conjures the impossible coupling of the
machine / incision / inscription - as if the world were divine (Foucauld-
ian divinatio) with style leaving space for thought otherwise. I am refer- 
encing Chinese or Japanese calligraphy - not pictogrammatic, but gesture 
which infiltrates the line and its endings in various pathways. It is the 
space or gap which reveals both the inertness of the world and the place- 
ment of writing as breathing, not harboring ontology or name the things of 
creation, but slowing their undoing. You might see affect in the layering 
of symbols, always, as if it impossible to speak without the body in mind, 
as if all creations are inequal, languorous and dependent upon their emo- 
tional originations. This is not the concrete poetry of the calligraphic; 
it is not the renaissance emblem or shaped poetics or signature. Instead, 
one might look to the writing as the slow movement of the earths absolving 
all denumerations, definitions, taxonomies - or the earths' quickness in 
asserting themselves through the releasing of signs into the earth, stone, 
metal, air, water, fire ... the ideogrammar of non-being, ideogrammar of 
this world's last creation ...

And this my own twisted stroke through all of it - the running writing,
grass writing, clerical, seal, etc. Or perhaps not the seal with, so oft-
en, its unnerving rectilinearity, already speaking confinement of the rim,
the contract. Certainly through the varying width of strokes otherwise.

In Seals (cdrom video), Azure and I demarcate each other's bodies, sealing
them with hanko stone and ink; our bodies tangle; the kanji are worn out,
worn through; exhausted, we're framed by the sealing processes; the ins-
criptions of the world disappearing into the flesh; in a certain silence
or background sound; you can watch in any order; there is also the clear
evidence of desire, erection going nowhere, seals just above penis and
vagina, the k/not of the writings - and presence or absence of the vacated
space of non-being, as if this were the next-to-last ...

Clearing a space, unnaming, all within the absenting of the frame as well, 
computer screen, software application screen, uncanny inertness of windows 
appearing and disappearing, inscription denying itself, an accumulation of 
protocols and languages tending towards their metaphoric dissolution ...

Fu Shan: "With painstaking care, he used a centered brush tip to make
strong, rounded strokes in imitation of the even, unmodulated lines in an-
cient bronze inscriptions. He also undermined the readability of the sutra
by littering it with strange characters. A religious text is seemingly
transformed into a magical charm by an unreadably archaic script further
confused by invented characters." (The Aesthetics of the Unusual and the
Strange in Seventeenth-Century Calligraphy, by Dora C. Y. Ching, in Harr-
ist and Fong, The Embodied Image: Chinese Calligraphy from the John B.
Elliott Collection.)

All machines of all languages and all words and all symbols and all subs-
trates and all texts and all utterances and all pauses and all sounds and
all worlds and all things and all non-things and all breaths and all mach-
ines ...

"And to dramative matters, Butor is an old friend of Klossowksi, and Klo- 
ssowski says: 'my syntax is Roberte's skin.' _My syntax,_ and not the sup- 
port for my writing or its eventual printing. And _Roberte's skin_ is the 
skin enclosing the volume of a discrete body carrying a proper name. Now 
isn't what Klossowski expresses here perversion? The hardness, the tension
of grammar and glossary operate like the production of a screen stretched 
to the breaking point. This screen closes upon itself into a voluminous 
body - the body of Roberte - amd this body can be connected to a subject 
who will inhabit its interior. Thus any fixed variation of grammar, of 
glossary will produce a sign, a shiver, a passing of intensity upon the 
body proper of the victim." (False Flights in Literature, Jean-Francois 
Lyotard, in Toward the Post-Modern, ed. Harvey and Roberts.) 

One might call forth the brush against the computer screen, stretched to
the breaking point across a skin wearing its display, immobilized, punc-
tured, hung. All machines and all languages and all protocols and all and 
so forth and all ... ... 

"Can there be speech, poetry, and thought beyond the letter, beyond the 
death of the voice and the death of language?" (Pascoli and the Thought of 
the Voice, Giorgio Agamben, The End of the Poem, Studies in Poetics.)

The imaginary of the sliding body within an inconceivability of the tech- 
nological (all technology is inconceivable), since, as for the calligraph- 
ic, it fastens itself (calligraphic ideogrammar)

"It is therefore not truly a matter of phono-symbolism, but rather a mat-
ter of a sphere so to speak beyond or before sound, a sphere that does not 
_symbolize_ anything as much as it simply _indicates_ an intention to sig- 
nify, that is, the voice in its originary purity." (ibid.)

The calligraphic fastens itself only in order to release; nothing gnaws
the end of the stroke or its delimitation, enumeration, against the radi-
cals which presuppose ruined and incoherent taxonomies. The stroke is the
weakest emission, however lending itself to techne, the rigorous ordering
of the remains of the world. In Seals, after the stroke of the hanko
against the rigorous skin, a drop of lubricant* appears at the tip of the
penis, as if the body might then, after all is said and written, continue
its slide elsewhere.

Calligraphic Legacy Applications and the Scrawl


unreadable calligraphic, the scrawl - one might think of the edgy brunt of
the symbol, borders unprotected, conjectural spaces. what occurs to read-
ing, paralleling outmoded tech - decades from now, cdroms will be as thick
- unable to be decoded. from the analog to the digital, decoding becomes
increasingly difficult. think of wire recording - this is readable at any
speed - the double difficulty lies only in direction and speed. with mul-
ti-tracking, an additional element - that of settlement of desired sounds
- how many might play control-track background in the distant future? but
all of this is relatively simple; helical-scan video - even scan-line vid-
eo already plays calligraphic havoc. with digital, the problem is close to
insurmountable - there are codes upon codes based on specific programs and
protocols; there is the requirement of highly-sophisticated machinery -
think of a 19th-century music-box cylinder without any other instructions
- without knowing the scale employed or even the means of sound production
- you're getting the idea. but the obtuse calligraphic itself is dependent
upon the knowledge that, not only is the substrate readable, but the fault
- if such it be - lies in the complex negotiation between writer and read- 
er - always already mediated. here again the unnerving, uncanny, unaccoun- 
table, is raised - as if the text has been cast loose from its overly fam- 
iliar mooring. think of xu bing or fu shan in this connection ...

calligraphic iii (the riddle)


calligraphic ideogrammar doesn't move, carries the dynamic within the
page, tendrils beneath the surface, holding the fastness of the ink, styl-
us cuneiform tending towards the impress of musculature upon the substrate
of clay, one follows the muscles in both, incisions, pronouncements, only
in writing can everything find embodiment - that is its primary, many into
one, in this instance even the proper name a universal, reading bodies in
the shimmerings, coalescence to unity, holding their own (obsessive-com-
pulsive neurosis of the name) - this primary as in, four arms of the mas-
culine body, as in - enshrouding mist, music and chant, sound and glad
tidings, sonorous quoting or citing, concealed and seal, addiction and
habitual craving, in the depth of the night, pornographic and luxurious,
loose and idle, feminine principle or moon, the shade of a tree north of a
hill or south of a river, the negative ion, private parts of a woman -
pressure of seal against the flesh of a screen, page of a body, screen of
a page - the speech of the writing crawling across the surface of a stone,
the cut of the crawl or double-stroke of the crawl, impress of the flow,
the residue of musculature, memory of the sign, sign of the memory - move-
ment of ideogrammar, movement of calligraphic - uncarrying dynamic beyond
the page, tendrils gone from the surface, ink spilling out

Internet Culture and Community

This course is designed to give students a broad overview of the past,
present, and future Internet, including its history, sociology, and
anthropology. We will focus on the development of online communities -
their ideologies, software structures, and demographics. Newsgroups,
chats, email lists, MUDs, MOOs, and text-based, graphic or 3-d meeting
spaces will be considered. We will also look at the construction of 
the "online subject" or user, and deal with issues such as "Internet
addiction," Net relationships and sexuality, and Net art/culture in
general. We'll pay attention to the ethos of hacking, the open software
source movement, and the Net from an international standpoint. This 
course is useful for understanding the Net in depth; it has practical
application as well for anyone working on on-line sites.
