Listen
I think they think they know me, I think they think they get it
Some holy water, crucifix 'n mix it with some lyrics
But this ain't that and that ain't rap, we're going in lock the front door if I ain't back
They feelin you, Crae, it's cool, I'm respected, but I won't be a slave to acceptance
I got my co-sign from the master, so maranatha
They like the flow, oh they go'n love the message (for real?)
Nah, I'm sure that they'll reject it, but that's what they supposed to do
Don't wanna see, they opposing views
Say they married to the game but mayne they souls stay itchin
She never hit the spot, I guess that's why they call her misses
My snap back fitted, the choir robe didn't
And I don't play church, partna, this is what I'm living
Hey Bun call from Texas, told me "'Crae, I get it
You are no impostor, you spit it how you live it
Them inmates tellin me keep spittin and don't quit it
Cause when that music play they ain't worried about the sentence"
25 to life boy the dead has risen
So tell Sing Sing, the king is coming back to get 'em
I'm so reckless with my message I don't care though
Call me a weirdo, but I'm an heirloom
And if I say it, then I mean what I say
Boy I live for the truth and I die for the way
And when that inspiration hit me I write it, while try to fight it
If I'm thinking too hard, don't try it, they'll never buy it
And if they don't buy it, they don't buy it, okay, I get it
They want inherited wealth, so I'm giving them the business
You are not your momma, your daddy, whatever happened
You are not the product of all of yo life's misshappnins
That is just a lie that you tell yourself when it's tragic
But I believe in miracles, I don't believe in magic
Made in his image, most of y'all don't hear me
Looking for identity in the things that you givin
The gift, not the giver mayne it's cold in the winter
When you face your life existence stop looking like you's a winner
That S class Mercedes, Bugatti, yeah that Bentley
Won't fit up in my coffin when I die, can't take em with me
But still I let em tempt me, and show me what I'm worth
But none of then can solve my problems or my hurt
Reject me

This is not the first time I'm far from just gettin my feet wet
And this is won't be the last time
I tell the world about your love and they tell me I'm a reject
Yeah, they look at me like a reject
Go and treat me like a reject
Cause if it's how they treated the king, then for Christ sake
All I wanna be is a reject</pre>
