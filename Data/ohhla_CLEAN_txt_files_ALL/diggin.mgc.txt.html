Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Killin them rocking them Icing
Im peeping the way you was looking at me
When I pull up rollin in my impala

Its ok (MC Magic)
I saw the way that you were looking at diggin on me
(Twista) (Snow white) (Just know that I am Diggin)
I gotta say you drive me crazy but its in a good way
Diggin Diggin on me

I like kickin one of my flows off with the guys
Da uh Strike a pose off cuz I am fly
Excuse me if I sound throwed off because am high
Are we taking each others clothes off without eyes
How you looking at me I wonder should a pimp should be at it
Is that your sister
Im Twista this is MC Magic
It should be tragic if I I don't get to call her
So I gots to let her know am a balla
Killin them rocking them Icing
I am peeping the way you was looking at me when I pull up rollin in my impala
Step up on outta and goin up into the club
And I know you was watching when I was in VIP throwing dollas
Now you be coming on closer
The you approaching contending your face
That you wanna just come on and holla
Just holla, just holla

It ok (its ok lil mama)
I saw the way that you were looking at diggin on me
I can see that you diggin on me (just know that I am diggin)
I gotta say you drive me crazy but it's in a good way
(it's all in a good good way)
Diggin diggin on me

I am trying talk to you mama
tell me where you from
Its arizona's best and Chicago's number 1 (number 1)
I like the way you got the body of a goddess
You and I together baby we can be the hottest
Pop champagne celebrate you the bestest
back at my place we the young and the restless
and I can tell that we about to have a good night
matter fact baby you can be my twilight
I'll do whatever so we could be together
Got me all hot like this arizona weather
Whats the first step babygirl to make you mine
and how many licks does it take to blow your mind
Esta mamacita me esta enamorando
Each and every day me la paso sonando
I can't control my behavior
Lil mama so cold 31 Flavors

It's ok (it's okay lil mama)
I saw the way that you were looking at diggin on me
I could see that you diggin on me (just know that I am diggin)
I gotta say you drive me crazy but its in a good way
Diggin Diggin on me

Um I think he saw me looking but I think he diggin me
But I got no problem with him calling me to get with me
He like the way I be wrecking them tracks
Ain't no one as real as me
And I be feeling the same way about everything we doing
So ima chill and see
Cuz he got the habit for having money to blow right
but I can imagine he gotta get with me Snow White
He telling me he feeling me I tell him hold tight
We both might hop on flights and ill show you what the West
Coast like
So we can go and you can show me how you treat a girl
We spending dough and makin more
Im trying see the world
But I ain't really in it for the diamonds and the pearls
Im trying see whats up if we can make this real love unfurl
See I am the girl that can change ya life
Im thinking I'm Diggin you
Im feeling the way that you talkin
I m thinking that we could find some things to do
Im up in the club and I am thinking that I could really get into you
I am getting a little more of a feeling that you don't have to think it through

It's ok (it's okay lil mama)
I saw the way that you were looking at diggin on me
I could see that you diggin on me (just know that I am diggin)
I gotta say you drive me crazy but it's in a good way
(it's all in a good good way)
Diggin Diggin on me</pre>
