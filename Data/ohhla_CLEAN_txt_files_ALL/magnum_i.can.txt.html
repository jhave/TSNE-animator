[Chorus]
Suivre Moi, come vibe with ya boy
With lyrics the whole industry silently enjoyed (Follow me)
Suivre moi, the leadership was annoyed
At lyrics the whole industry silently enjoyed (The MC)
Suivre moi, the leadership is annoyed
At lyrics the whole industry silently enjoyed
Suivre moi, come vibe with ya boy
With lyrics the whole industry silently enjoyed

[Canibus]
I was taught my heart was my brain in my past life
I was thrashed in a fight over my passion for the mic
Risked the ultimate sacrifice to rhyme, askin' Christ why?
He replied; "Passions like mine have a price"
They will grab you if you grab the mic
Try to squeeze the life from you, take away your life
There's only one way to fight
Zero gravity device, turn it on
Impale them on stalactites and stalagmites, alright?
I was hyped; he told me that every word I recite
Symbolically represents the whole world's kryptonite
Includin; but not limited to spittin' in the booth
Spit the truth; tell the leadership to listen to the troops
The leadership bleeds blue, we bleed red
In the end the only thing we can agree on is death
I beg you to get it together
To truly be clever you gotta be able to think ahead and remember
'Cause most of us have forgotten where we came from
Turned a blind eye to the energy that made us
I ain't the same Canibus I was
But I still get busy 'cause that's what Canibus does
The rhymes are relevant day after my development
Food for thought, beverages should be free but they keep sellin' it
The mixtape comes out today, announce the date
The potato gets off his couch to wait
'Cause he knows something wicked his way comes
They can hear the sound of the war drum,
Canibus save them!
I can't save you, but you can save yourself
We can save each other, I just came to help
The event you cant prevent no matter how much you spend
Your catalogue remains thin no matter how much you pen
I stand with my men, lookin' at the flag draped coffins again
Cryin', justifyin' what I did
There's no excuse cause nobody will ever know the truth
I will never get over the abuse - fuck you!...
*Pause*
I gotta keep Hip-Hop open, if they close it I'm homeless
If I lose it I'm broken, if I disown it I'm hopeless
I am a hopeless romantic Trans-Atlantic pimp
In the pacific stickin' dick to Los Angeles bitches
Bitch please!, be my guest
Shot her in the head while she slept
What would she dream about next?
I'm a maniac nigga, so fuck rap nigga
Bigorexia anxiety attack nigga
If you're loyal I'll murder for you
You disloyal I'll destroy you
Rhodesian Ridgeback will and turn on you
Keep Hip-Hop alive if you don't we die
We includes me, you, K-Solo and Nas
Keep Hip-Hop open 'cause if they close it I'm homeless
If I lose it I'm broken, if I disown it I'm hopeless
Focus!

[Chorus]
Suivre moi, the leadership was annoyed
