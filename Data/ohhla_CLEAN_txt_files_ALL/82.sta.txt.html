[Intro - Statik Selektah - talking] (*echo*)
Been a long time coming
The year was '82

[Chorus - Termanology] ["scratched"]
["Eighty-two"]
["Eighty-two"]
I'm the most underrated
We put it down in the streets (down, down in the streets)

["Eighty-two"]
1982
Alright let's get it, where's the headphones at?
1982
1982, the album comin soon

[Verse 1 - Termanology]
I was born in late '82, made it through, crazy crews
Beef in my shady zoo, over town, paper grew
Off of drugs, off of slugs, in your brain and who
Ever would of thought I rock in front of twenty-two
Thousand, proud when, I seen my face in The Source, 2005
Live, what a crazy ride
Took in from the precinct, locked for the weekend
To doin videos with platinum rap people
Bun B, Premo, Cassidy, had to be
Some of the most fun in my life, fuck wrap the keys
Now I just rap to beats, Stat' and me, pass the trees
1982, the album is a masterpiece
XXL, Source, Vibe actually
All the press, this shit is for y'all, download for free
You could do coke or E, Percocet, OCs
Still none of that gets you as high as when you quotin me

[Chorus - Termanology] ["scratched"]
Termanology
["Eighty-two"]
(Statik Selektah)
["Eighty-two"]
I'm the most underrated
We put it down in the streets (down, down in the streets)
Uh, uh, uh
["Eighty-two"]]
(1982), 1982
["Eighty-two"]
1982, the album comin soon

[Verse 2 - Termanology]
Hey yo, ten, eight, eighty-two, now you know my born date
More hate, from my enemies, more court dates
But it couldn't stop the kid, I was too populace
Popular, chocolate thai, let me cop a knick
Smoke lye like Alchemist, Evidence
Hella spliffs, hella piff, B-Real and Snoop mix
Cocky like 50 Cent, humble like Common Sense
Confident, doin pretty good for a Lawrence kid
Reppin NY too and my Hell Town crew
Beantown love, three's up homie (ew, ew)
Law-Town General, born in Lawrence General
Put me on a pedestal, better than anyone you know
I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far
Sub par motherfuckers better step up your bars
Yo I aim for the stars, so I might shoot a rapper
Get out the way or get introduced to the pastor
