[Hook]
Who hotter than me, who hotter than me (x6)
Got a question for the streets (huh, huh)
Who hotter than me
Got a question for the streets (huh, huh)
Who hotter than me (ha, ha)

[Verse 1]
How you feel haters, your hatin didn't work
Thanks to ya'll I'm the hottest thang on earth
Got the bitches and the goons I'm the first
Worth a couple mill, but still in the dirt
Catch me flushin thru the city shorty no shirt
I don't fall gonna come on the first
Blew life in the streets, had em rebirth
See me on fire hater, I know it gotta hurt
I'm so hood, classic verse
Wanna talk business, what's in the purse
Might gone die, won't get murked
Who hotter than me, nobody sir

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Betcha can't name a hoe, who don't want it
Like you can't name a city I ain't hot in
Make you rich, for about 30 grand
On fire dog, where my fan
Tell you what to call me, promoter best friend
Put cha money on me dog, if you want win
Lotta rappers sittin home on the weekend
Gotta waitin list shorty put cha off in
Can't move me dawg for under 30 grand
Try to give me 29 if you think I'm playin
Who runnin the streets where all the folks in
Streets done spoke, shawty I'm the man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Somebody put me out, I'm on fire
Please tell the feds, I'm retired
Know a lot of rappers for hire
Streets don't fuck with you, you a liar
Plies real, you're preachin to the choir
Yo buzz in the streets expired
Count a hundred grand I'm kinda tired
Keep yo hoe from around me before I buy her
Goons love me I'm they supplier
Street cred don't get no higher
Got the 40 homie cause it's lighter
Sincerely yours mr. plier
