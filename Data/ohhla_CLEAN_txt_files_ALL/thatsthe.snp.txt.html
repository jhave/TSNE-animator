[Chorus 1]
[Women Singing]
Big Snoop Dogg, nigga that's the shit
Cris on ice, nigga that's the shit
Llacs on dubs, nigga that's the shit
[Snoop]
Step into the party just to crack a biatch
[Woman Singing]
For all you players who don't know
Nobody pimp em like a gangsta from the LBC
[Snoop]
Pimpin ain't easy but its a whole lotta fun
East Side, Long Beach, thats where it all begun
[Woman Singing]
Nigga thats the shit

[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg]
Turn up the bass, hand me my blizzles I don't fuck with cigars
I got my own clothin line, and plus my own line of cars
I got a staple of bitches, and they all play they part
I got a gang of ruthless homies that gt loc'd after dark
Ya get it? (get it?) Get it, got it whatever
Got Snoop Dogg shoes suede, gator or leather
Ohhhhweeeee! and got a way to endeavour
Even if it ain't never I can give the bitch pleasure
My little white bitch Heather
She stunning, sly, slick and oh so clever
Never under pressure
Leave me money on the dresser
Give it to me baby so I can keep us together
Whether is cold, or it might be hot
One things for sure, I be takin alot
Givin alot, and when it comes to music I be makin it hot
Shakin the spot, takin the pot
Bringin it back

[Chorus 2]
[Women Singing]
Big Snoop Dogg, nigga that's the shit
Cris on ice, nigga that's the shit
Llacs on dubs, nigga that's the shit
[Snoop]
Step into the party just to crack a biatch
[Woman Singing]
For all you players that don't know
Nobody pimp em like a gangsta from the LBC
[Snoop]
And for you bitches who don't know
Till we D-I, we keep it P-I
[Woman Singing]
Nigga thats the shit

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
Do you remember the reign
Before you boy had Joey and gained growin pains
Know this game, I flow this game
I spit it, get it, knit it, thread it and sewed this game
(Say Wha?) They say I came in a shady way
Watch how I play this game
Bossin up, ain't he man
So do it do him Jazzy fizzle
My young nizzle for shizzle we keep it off the hizzle
Do me a favor, and blaze up another bleezie
and tell baby over there to come and please me
She won't believe me
She will for sheezie
Bitch, its the big Snoop D-O-double geezie
Bucket mouth breezie
I got a staple of bitches so take it easy
I'm only fuckin with your imagination
Try to give you a little small conversation
You know what your facin

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
[Snoop Dogg]
Y'all niggas better sit me down now
Welcome back to tippy tales
Snoopy got this shit crackin, these bitches wanna lick me now
Everybody minglin, dime pieces bring em in
I set the trend, fly from gators to trims
(WHY?) You haters begin to fuck around with the boss
You get nailed to the cross fuckin around with the boss
I'm too hard in the paint, might as well choke up the loss
Hey baby grab my longest mink so Snoop Dogg can floss
Toss, free is the cost, I don't pay for a damn thing
I just pop the champaigne, kick off a pimp and campaign
Man, I got the spotlight on me jack
Now I'ma act a damn fool and I ain't never comin back
King Mack-A-Hoe, Sir Break-A-Bitch
Grab my pimp glass and then I take a sip
I look around, pull it out and then I light it up
Take a puff, inhale it, bluff bitch now ya know it

[Pharrell Williams]
I walk with a limp, eat lobster and shrimp
Shine a spotlight down on a pimp
Pull up like a mack, in my Snoop DeVille
and ride on the side, and we's dressed to kill
You see me stoppin girl, get your ass to the side
It ain't enough room to fit ya all in my ride"

[Snoop Dogg]
Dave cut the record down to the bone
And Jazzy Phe got me rockin on the microphone
Now we talkin autographs, cheers and laughs
Champaigne, caviar and bubble baths

[Chorus 1]</pre>
