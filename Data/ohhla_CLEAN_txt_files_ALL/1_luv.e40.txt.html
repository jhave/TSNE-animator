This is the operator.  I have a collect call from
"Hey this yo' potnah main!"
who is an inmate in a California State prison
To deny charges, hang up now
To accept charges, press five now

Mmmmm..... welllll
One love (one love) 
ohhhhh (one love)                       The L, the L, the L, the L
One love (one love) 
welll (there's only one love)           The O, the O, the O, the O
One love (one love) 
ohhhhh (one love)                       and the V, the V, the V, the V
One love (one love) 
welll (there's only one love)           it's the E, the E, the E, the E

[Verse One]
Member that game Fat Bank Take Skinny Bank?
Well now we play Skinny Bank Take Fat Bank
That's because it ain't no work bein offered main
They act like they ain't even thinkin bout us main
I promise I swear the po-po threw my homey in the slammer
Did him bad, wish I had my candid camera, made me mad
Vanilla be swarmin like bees surveillance binoculars hidden in trees
Reliable sources copying keys, oh p-uh-please
One for the life, and two for death
Three damn strikes no chances left
Let me tell ya lil bout me
E-40 and the C-L-I-C we used to have to use
sheets for curtains, socks for washtowels
I was happy as hell when my cousin gave me his hand-me-downs
This ain't no happy Shirley Temple talleistic crap
This here is serious more Realistic than Radio Shack
Observe as I strike a nerve, reach out and touch my kind
Open up your photo album man, and I bet you find
Folks that passed away, potnahs that been blasted away
I miss you steal some liquor main, who got some tissue

[Chorus: Leviti and E-40] + (Geraldine Michaels)
One love (one love)                     One love
ohhhh (one love)
One love (one love) well well           One love
well wellll (there's only one love)
One love (one love)                     One love
ohhhh (one love)
One love (one love) well well           One love
well wellll (there's only one love)

[Verse Two]
E'rybody wanna shoot em up bang bang
Way I was raised we had to knuckle up and throw them thangs
We got em up and you know I had to check em swell
Cuz if I ran home and didn't fight back my mom'd beat that tail
Just received word from my folks upstate
They said uh, they tryin ta, they tryin ta take away our weights
And uh, no more beef and pork just muslim books and fish fork
and laps around the yard with my Walkman bumpin this
Now I'm bouts ta get married, is it clever
Thought it was, till I got the Dear John letter
Been down for ten bucks and got a eight year stay
And I just found out she had her baby yesterday
Ain't nobody been to see me yet, but I ain't gonna worry
Man ya out there ballin main can you drop a twenty up in my commisary
Uhh, my family thinks that I'm a thug homie
When you see my momma man give her a hug for me
And tell her

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Huh, thinkin back, you gotta watch your back and play it well
Enjoyed myself when I was out there tryin ta get in that mail
We used to kick it at the waterfront the whole Vallejo
Watchin the pervin contestses between E-40 and Del
That's what we did up under the bridge fools posted up
Choppin game conversatin gettin toast up
Leanin against my seamless convertible tops and boosted cleaners
Them Click boys mobbin deep in cuts, actin meanest
The good times, they gone, here in the can is my new phone
Guess in order to do some right I had to do some wrong
Picked up a package yesterday and I was HAPPY
It was a box and full of goodies from my PAPPY
Tripped me out ain't seen or heard from Poppa Duke in years
Sent me a picture and some fetti dang they sheadin tears
See first you born then you live then you die
One day soon I'll get another try, one love

[Chorus]</pre>
