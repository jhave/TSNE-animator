[O.G. Ron - Talking]
Yeah..Yall listening to the Chamillionaire's Greatest Hitz mayne
The real deal..don't get the bootleg
If O.G. Ron C ain't on yo shit mayne, you got the bootleg
Get the real shit

[Chamillionaire]
Mans from the state Tex
We treat plex like great sex
Look at my dresser..and I bet you gon' see where we latex
I'm not the woofer, ask Thug or E.S.G. and you'll discover
That I'm not Brandy's little brother
I'm as gutta as a gutter
They love the way the candy color..steady switchin' to another
Keep so much heat under the seat my starch is stickin' to the butter
Rap fans wanna dap hands cuz they know how we stack grands
But haters don't want no heat like Ms.Pink in Pac Man
Koopa

[Chorus: Chamillionaire (E.S.G.) {Y2 Twon}]
{This one for gangstaz}
(This one for thugstaz)
This one for my S.H. {what's that?}
Street Hustlaz
{This one for gangstaz}
(This one for thugstaz)
This one for my S.H. {what's that?}
