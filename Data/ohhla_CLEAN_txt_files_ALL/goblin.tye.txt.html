{You wouldn't do that Tyler}
{Kill yourself or anyone}
{You don't even have the balls, to begin with}
{What you need is... me~! Someone to talk to}
{Uhh it's been a while since our last session so}
{Tell me what's been going on}

[Tyler, the Creator]
I'm not a fuckin role model {I know this}
I'm a 19 year old fuckin emotional coaster with pipe dreams
Since Kanye tweeted tellin people he's bumpin all of my shit
These mothafuckers think I'm 'sposed to live up to somethin? Shit
I'm still jackin off and proceeding my life careless
but getting more pussy cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris {as you should}
L.A. to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares
at skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird
"Yonkers" dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
Now competition missin like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet {that's not your fault}
but that's a whole fuckin different argument, shit, I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy
a couple hot pockets and grandma can stop cookin
them nasty-ass collard greens
Pressure's on me like this top hat
"Bastard" intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?

[Interlude]
{Tyler, you'll top it}
{You'll top that, you're a very capable individual}
Okay, you guys caught me
I'm not a fuckin rapist, or a serial killer
I lied {You know you, you just want attention}
{You'll be fine} I try too hard, huh?
Hehe {No.. you don't}

[Tyler, the Creator]
Made a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet
The 'preme shit is free and I don't drink, so fuck a wine set
Nigga fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity
I'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity
Oh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshipper
cause I'm too fuckin ignorant to do some research?
I'm the star of the group {yeah}
So no one else gets the respect that they deserve {CAUSE OF YOU}
{Bastard was good though!} What you think I record it for?
To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
Like I didn't make" Parade" or "Inglorious"
cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fuckin feel?
Of COURSE they only listen to lyrics about me pissin off
in the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off {I bet}
Message boards are on my dick, I need a pissin waiver {here}
Let me bust one in they mouth, I know they feel the flavor

[Interlude]
{So umm, uhh...}
Can't they just be happy for me like
a kid with nothin, livin out his dreams?
Why they got to fuckin hate?
{I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature}
{Everyone loves you Tyler, you have to believe that}
I-I-I don't even skate anymore
I'm too fuckin busy... I can barely kickflip now
{Why? Why is that?}
{Do you not have any free time at your home?}
What the fuck you mean I'm not talented?
You see the shit that I've been doing?
{I have! And, I think you're a great person}
I mean, I'm not that great of a rapper but
as a whole, I'm pretty cool, right?

[Tyler, the Creator]
People excited, thinkin shit is so tight {what?}
Gettin co-signs from rappers that I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic? 
And start Jackson him off, until his cap blastin off? {No!}
Fuck that {yeah} these niggaz ain't fuckin with me
cause I don't listen to the +Immortal+ of +Tech+ of the +nique+
and all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week
I'd rather listen to +Badu+ and +Pusha+ the +T+
and some +Waka Flocka Flame+ instead of that real hip-hop
that's +bull+ of the +sheet+, but they want to critique
everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released
But they don't get it {they don't} cause it's not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rappin, it's made for him
But they do not have the mindset, that's same as him
I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him

[Interlude]
{It is, but Tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that "faggot" word}
{That's very, that's a bad}
I'm not homophobic
{I mean, I don't think you are but} FAGGOT~!
{Alright, well, since the last time we...}
The fuck is a good performance
I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can
{I mean, you you, it seems like you have fun}
{But your Twitter posts are just}
{I mean, they're really random, and it's ADD}
Who doesn't have ADD? Well, I don't!
{I mean, sometimes, you're just really out in the distance}
{And we just want to know, what's the problem for this?}
I wish Thebe was here

[Tyler, the Creator]
Therapy's been sinnin and niggaz getting offended
They don't want to fuck with me cause I do not fuck with religion
You see, that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen
Here, put this middle finger in your ear {I'd rather not}
When someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed
his AK-47 at 47 kids
I don't wanna see my name mentioned {I don't think anyone's going to}
{I don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you}
College wasn't workin and I wasn't workin
So I was at home jerkin off until my dick was hurtin
But I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait
Cause the four days that I went, I wasn't learnin shit
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since eight
and can afford to get my mother something on her birth-day
{Well, you explained to me that you were in school}
{But, I mean, I.. I..} They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone
My life is doin pretty good, so that date is postponed for now
Wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons, nigga, throw 'em at pedestrians
{So... what are you sayin take advantage?}
{I mean, you've been doing pretty good, I've seen that}

[Tyler, the Creator]
I still live in my grandma's house
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fuckin life, but when I make that announcement
my hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
and then I am confused if I want in or just out
My friends really think I'm playin when I say I need counseling
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout
And shout loud inside, sometimes I just want to die {no you don't}
Odd Future came from the bottom
And it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryin stop 'em {I believe you}
All you fucking lames don't have to like me
+The Devil+ doesn't +Wear Prada+
I'm clearly in a fuckin white tee!!!
{Whoa~! Umm, alright! Uhh}
{So you was telling me you went to New York}</pre>
