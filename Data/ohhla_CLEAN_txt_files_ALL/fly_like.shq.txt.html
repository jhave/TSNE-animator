(Shaquille O'Neal)
Yo Trigg

(Trigga)
Yeah, yeah diesel

(Shaquille O'Neal)

(Trigga)
Let's flow dog
Diesel, diesel

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Wha-wha-wha-wha

(Trigga)
Diesel, lethal
Diesel, lethal
Diesel, lethal

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Speed baller to Emblem ember shot caller
Natural born athlete, actor with a rap sheet
Contain live parts minority five stars 
See me on it g'z at your neighborhood ball park

(Trigga)
Spark explosives an LA way magic doses 
?Elopeses? minor league you can't cope kid   
We prime slack, twelve o' clock news a lot
Half time we gonna dedicate to Biggie &amp; Pac
Eazy just got rocked, forgive me if I forgot
Do believe we mourn till the traffics torn

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Till hip-hop's reborn till the youth is worn
Peace to all setbacks, time the key, fuck rap

(Trigga)
Ahead of the game I'll be better with fame 
Displaying one's name, cool legers get cheddar in vain
Nuff to make the sane insane, the tame untame
New rules, new opponents lost is no condolence 
And we ain't studying till we stable holding
You holding, you holding, you holding, you holding, you holding 

(Chorus)
(Trigga)
Flow diesel, so lethal need a sequel 
No equals oh fly like an eagle
Prime tracks making power moves with Shaq
Hold that, hold this Big Dogs don't miss

(Trigga)
Fans claim on the court torch the jam sport

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Millennium leader sip Gataray no trieve-a

(Trigga)
Focus physical soul-matic with the lyrical

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Crack balls with swords leave you in gay form

(Trigga)
Let me find out let me find out 
Pressure on you, you yell time out 

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Sports illustrated hip-hop affiliated upgraded
Killer rumors are being out-gated 

(Trigga)
Giant it's me in my alliance trade Mack for science 

(Shaquille O'Neal)
No long shot, chest pass when the balls hot

(Trigga)
Winners ingredients slow it up be obedient
Learning something, close attention might earn you something 
Sit on a plane, master the game, life of a cane 

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Rock the crowd like a cango, peep the lango
Old nil flow so ill from any angle 

(Trigga)
We switch while you throw bricks and air balls
Pay raps for calls, never make it to play-offs

(Chorus)
(Trigga)
Flow diesel, so lethal need a sequel 
No equals oh fly like an eagle
Prime tracks making power moves with Shaq
Hold that, hold this Big Dogs don't miss

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Score half a man, tour inner more than a clan 
Official fam, protect ya neck, T.W.IsM.

(Trigga)
Shizam generation X ask Flex
We ain't against the law guess it's cause you too tall
Too muscular, too busy with the sizzler
B-boy's can't stand so they hawk us 
Send an enemy to stalk us self-destructers 
I slam jam bring ruckus get you suckers 

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Seven man scissors like the ones I ain't planned 
Ball daily, hoops from the roof like Haley
(Twin tower blocks) me, Brian and Fox 

(Trigga)
Non-stop am, pm at the Coliseum
Players is timid when we get in its no limit 
Flow splendid a fast brakes how we end it 

(Chorus)
(Trigga)
Flow diesel, so lethal need a sequel 
No equals oh fly like an eagle
Prime tracks making power moves with Shaq
Hold that, hold this Big Dogs don't miss
Flow diesel, so lethal need a sequel 
No equals oh fly like an eagle
Prime tracks making power moves with Shaq
Hold that, hold this Big Dogs don't miss

(Shaquille O'Neal)
(Flow diesel) 
Big Dogs don't miss Big Dogs don't miss
Big Dogs don't miss Big Dogs don't miss
Flow diesel, so lethal need a sequel 
No equals aiyyo fly like an eagle

(Trigga) 
Yo, yo, yo you gotta drop me off at Coney island man 
(What?) You gotta take me to Coney Island man

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Nah dog, nah dog we on our way to Jersey the Brick city son

(Trigga)

I can't get on a train from here

(Shaquille O'Neal)
