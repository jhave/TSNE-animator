Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Get some brand new kicks
Couple hundred on the jeans
I been spendin all this money got me feelin like a g
Hand me down gear, some shit you never seen
Droppin three stacks now, so fresh so clean
See we never coulda dreamed of
All of the shit me and my team does
Girls see me like damn you look good now you cleaned up
Feelin fresh got my teeth brushed
Ima new kid been waiting to do this
They hatin up on my plate got some steak and its rocris
Been feelin like a true pimp Biatch
It's 05? I'm the steelers you the seahawks
This weed I keep hittin makin me cough
Jolly giant, I'm jack smokin the bean stock
I get hoes in boat shoes
Now I won't lose, welcome to the old school bitch

[Chorus]
Now my clothes look cleaner
And my kicks look fly
We be buyin more reefer so my crew gettin high
Now the girls keep callin and the money keep comin
I be jumpin off the bridge but, I'ma hit the ground runnin
When the fuck will I wake up
I ask em when the fuck will I wake up
Cause every single day their suttin new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin hit snooze

[Verse 2]
Hit snooze I aint tryna wake up yet
Ima keep on dreamin be the straight up best
And I'm blessed
Everyday and I'm getting straight up fresh
My homies like Mac damn you get your cake up yes I did
That's the life I live I grind all day
High School sellin mixtapes in the hallway
I bet they never thought I'd be this cool
Now they understand why I skip school
Had my dreams wasn't worried at all
This from gettin bored I go splurge at the mall
I got money, I got bitches
I got everything they dreamin of and I aint done shit yet
This major leagues big business
Used to have a wish list
Now I just give gifts
Shit would make me happy
Here's how to reach me
You can get at me

[Chorus]
Now my clothes look cleaner
And my kicks look fly
We be buyin more reefer so my crew gettin high
Now the girls keep callin and the money keep comin
I be jumpin off the bridge but, I'ma hit the ground runnin
When the fuck will I wake up
I ask em when the fuck will I wake up
Cause every single day their suttin new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin hit snooze

When the fuck will I wake up
I ask em when the fuck will I wake up
Cause every single day their suttin new to do
So ima keep on dreamin hit snooze

Now my clothes look cleaner
And my kicks look fly
We be buyin more reefer so my crew gettin high
Now the girls keep callin and the money keep comin
I be jumpin off the bridge but, I'ma hit the ground runnin
When the fuck will I wake up
I Ask em when the fuck will I wake up
Cause every single day their suttin new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin hit snooze</pre>
