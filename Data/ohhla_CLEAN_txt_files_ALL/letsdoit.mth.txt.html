[Redman]
Grab a - hold to ya seats, my style bulldoze the streets
I talk dirty, puncture holes in my teeth
Cavity creep, I'm young hung over thirty
You with it move with it, now shut up I'm cool with it
Doc-tor, Jurassic IV rap-tor
Wrap your head in a gorge in trenches where rats crawl
It's mine (brrrr) that's yours, my gun is bisexual
It's hittin male or female when I'm lettin go
This is a code alert; my truck rim size da number
on Jordan shirt, 23's got to work
We stick to the streets my shell toe's Velcro 
There I go - wearwolf standing with scarecrow s
Y'all niggaz barely move me 
'til you grow some balls like ms. Mann from Scary Movie
You banned from being mooly
I keep it black gutter, white gutter
Chinese gutter by these brothers
Here try these fuckers here
 
[Chorus: Meth and Red]
All my niggaz let's do it
All my bitches floorin that ass let's do it
Looks a crooked eye motherfucker let's do it
Meth and Doc we got it locked let's do it
My block let's do it
 
[Method Man]
I'm just too Kool and the Gang, it's a beautiful thang
Street pharmaceutical slang scoop loose in the brain
One mo' gen juice in my gin abusin yo chin
Be losing your religion again when the venom kicks in
Living with sin citizen X triple the threat 
Mad dog wreck a animal house send in the vets
There it goes picking my nose fixing my clothes
At the same time keeping my flows different from yourz
Low key with the gold teeth half a O-Z on my person
Lookin at y'all niggaz like y'all owe me
For certain I'm all that my fo'-mat
wearin out ya do'-mat I'm hurtin commercialized acts
It's a wrap pull the curtain, Long John be long gone
I pop shit and pop more bottles then Sean Don
I got chip I'm just too ghetto like Banton
Mike V it's all in my jeans like Sean John
 
[Chorus: Meth and Red] - repeat 2X
All my niggas let's do it
All my bitches floorin that ass let's do it
Looks a crooked eye motherfucker let's do it
Meth and Doc we got it locked let's do it
My block let's do it
 
[Redman]
Oow put ya ear to the train track I'm still comin
I +Stroke+ +Different+, after hours ya Phil Drummond
Peel lemons and put 'em in bitches Coronas
Hopin bitches will bone us, throw they lips on my shoulder
Where all my dirty fingernail tell her right hell
I'm a lay patient to play Jason and when you nightmare
STOP pop cordureoys and we order toys
Medulla oblongata mean on them +Waterboys+
Gorilla man do whatever
I'm bound to make a fan do the same thing Stan did in a letter
I bounce with a bitch with a ounce on a trip
Take her girlfriend, nut in they mouth when they kiss 
And I make em SCREAM - I go banana yo
With animal anecdotes with Hannibal hammer loads
You be ducking like the pope when he bow in
You get that for touchin pit throats when they chowin 
 
[Chorus: Meth and Red] - repeat 2X
All my niggas let's do it
All my bitches floorin that ass let's do it
Looks a crooked eye motherfucker let's do it
Meth and Doc we got it locked let's do it
My block let's do it
 
[Method Man]
Now that's that shit - that makes me zone the fuck out
in the club and get thrown the fuck out
Now ain't that a bitch - if y'all ain't with us then forget us
Miss Ebon ? hip hop guerillas
Damn just do the damn thing, ruin the game
For everybody bury the body, ruin my name
Meth man left hand Game Boy Advanced
Def Jam's employee of the month now let's dance
 
[Chorus: Meth and Red] - repeat 2x
All my niggas let's do it
All my bitches floorin that ass let's do it
Looks a crooked eye motherfucker let's do it
Meth and Doc we got it locked let's do it
My block let's do it
 
[Method Man]
Haha let's do it {5x}
Meth and Doc
All my peoples all my bitches
