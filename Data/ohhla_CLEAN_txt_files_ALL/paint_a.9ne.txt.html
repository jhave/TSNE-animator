Man lives
In a sun lit world
Of what he believes to be reality
But
There is unseen by most
An underworld that is just as real
But not as brightly lit a
DARKSIDE

I can write a verse and take the sun away... DARKNESS
Say good bye to light bcause it's gone today... DARKNESS
Ain't no smiling happiness is done away... DARKNESS
Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away... DARKNESS

[Tech N9ne]
I don't really give of fuck what you think of me I had it up to here. yep.
Follow me into another de-mention of insanity's right here. step...
I know your feelin it I'm lovin you
when I'm kissin n fuckin you n in a minute I'm a veer left
An by the pluck of the jugular see the blood of my lover
and then I finish when your near death
I'm sorry but I mean it cause when I got the tool on bitch
I got bulimic up in her like a gynecologist with a penis
And when they bled on me I was giddy and never squeamish
Bad as a demon I cannot get rid of her
I really rely on the feelin of the sex an the red of a woman
Can I take a bite of your cerebellum
I think it'll really get me up if I could be suckin your seratonin
Id rather just die than inflict any pain on somebody who truly put trusted me
Better yet I just make her the suffer who taught me mocked me n fucked with me
Maybe get up in the club and shoot it up and makem panic at the disco... (backwards)

I can paint a dark picture
You don't want me to start with, cha
Don't want me commin with the heart, hit cha
Chew you up and if you really tart, spit cha
After the brain I put the lemon moraine in
Blood of a dame is what I drain my fang's in
Takein the spirit and the body it came in
Away from the sun n forever you can remain in

(Chorus)
I can write a verse and take the sun away... DARKNESS
Say good bye to light bcause it's gone today... DARKNESS...
Ain't no smiling happiness is done away... DARKNESS
Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away. DARKNESS

I can write a verse and take the sun away DARKNESS
Say good bye to light bcause it's gone today DARKNESS
Ain't no smiling happiness is done away DARKNESS

When I'm all up on a pallet a pain with blood of my name in vain sun up in it
Imna break it down the walls n try to stop me from poppin my gun up in it
Skits onta me honor me for the time
never given to the rhyme in another mind lookin like a nice guy
Behind the face be the beast of another motherfucker that be heard the least
So many here me when I say they can
that I remember everybody that layd me astray. yo fuckem
Nobody but my closest know about my darkness and when they fall away. yo fuckem
I'm to sick that I never checked outa my mental-ward working in sweden
Burin the bodies this song made my memory feedm ghost made me loud and I'm proud I can see them
I don't even wanna talk about it but I do it for the demons and the devils alive
Hopein that the nonbelievers get a number two in the eye please try to die save me the time
When I make a move when I'm commin through I'm a stay devoted to rhyme [x9]
Devoted to mine hex sign ruda wicked I'm a be forever de-dine
Picture this my wrist silt pissed off I'm hangin from a meat hook
Yo I'm bangin on a meat hook it's the twist
this chapter ya miss the darker the venom of a main hook book
I'm tellin everybody I'm not doin so well
I'm feelin my noggin to you better watch ya self
Sub-noise when I'm bangin on a tech set
best believe the dark times are here my lips eclipse everything

(Chorus)

I'm your worst fear
I'm your favorite
I'm your acquired taste
Will you savor it
If it blood thirst will you run from it
No need cause I'm inside of you
When the sun is spit
You cannot escape me I'm your last resort your
When you have a evil you cannot report
I'm your royal sunshine malicious and heartless
If ever you need an alibi rely on me I am

DARKNESS
