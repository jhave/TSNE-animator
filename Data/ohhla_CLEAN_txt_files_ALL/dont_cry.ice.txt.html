"All praises due to the one Just Ice"
"Cos I'm bearing the truth and nothing less"
"Cos I'm bearing the truth and nothing less"
"Cos I'm bearing the truth and nothing less"
"Let's rest, so I can take a breath, cos I'm bearing the truth and nothing 
less"

[Just Ice]
Motherfuckers wanna be gangstas talkin all kind of shit
So I'ma take it to theses niggas show em how real shit can get
I get the chicks with the big tits, fat ass and the thick lips
The firm thighs, bright eyes, cute face and tight lipped
Cheddar balls in every pocket
Dick stay hard like a rocket
Ready to fuck any bird that move
I ain't got a damn thing to prove
Only take shit to the streets
Then I bring shit from the streets
Always make shit from the streets
Constantly break shit in the streets
Motherfuckers talkin that love shit
Like it's something you ever heard of
Soon as you turn your back
Say motherfuckers talkin murder
Talkin about your demise
Splitting up your pies
The nest nigga that's in line
That's the next nigga that's gonna rise
A sim showed me some love nigga
Who appeared to be nothin great
That was your man, who was your man?
Now scramblin got you wet
Get your vest and take it off
Nigga, that court room ripped you off
Livin in his home, suckin his dick talkin on his phone
Layin up in his bed
Fuckin around with his head
While I run the place in red
And you lay up there half dead
Talkin about this pain that you feel
You wanna die?
No, gangsta's don't bitch
And we never, ever cry
If you wanna run the streets like a thug
Fast car, fast life, girl, drug
20 inch rims on your brand new Benz
Platinum and ice on every other ring
If you wanna run the streets just like a thug
Fast car, fast life, girls, drugs
20 inch rims on your brand new Benz
Platinum and ice on every other ring
Cos I'm a gangsta</pre>
