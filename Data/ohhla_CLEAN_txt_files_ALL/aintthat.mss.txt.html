(Intro: Missy)
This is another Missy Elliot exclusive

[Verse 1: Missy]
I remember when yo ass was broke, so in love wit me
You were always at home, always talkin bout
"loan me this, loan me that, now gimme gimme"
And then ya got doe, and decide ya wanna leave
Gotta few chicks checkin for ya now, huh, you forgot about me
(Ain't it funny)

[Chorus]
When ya man gets money
I bet you can't find him
But when he come home beggin
You can't deny him
Where he at when you need him?
(he's out lookin cute)
But when he need a few dollers
He know who to run to

[Verse 2]
We would go out, I had to pay for everything
I never had to worry about you fuckin 'round
You used to tell me "Yea I love ya, No one above ya"
Then I bought you clothes, I made ya look like a king
Then the girls started flirtin wit ya ass, huh, and you forgot about me
(Ain't it funny)

[Chorus]

[Hook]
I'll be the one you runnin to
when yo pockets is low
And you outta cash flow
And the chicks don't want you no mo'

(Beat comes back in)

Be the one you runnin to
When you got no mo' gas
In those buses, catchin cabs
And the chicks don't see you no mo'

[Chorus]</pre>
