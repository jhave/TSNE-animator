I'ma bounce wit'cha though, yo
We gon' bounce everywhere we go
Make a nigga wanna bounce
Make a nigga burn a ounce

Get loose, get wild, now get set
Yeah it's the anthem, nigga it's the shit
You can get crunk, get hyphy, get fit
You can bounce like you're hoppin over a muh'fuckin fence
If you in the whip, ghostride the bitch
Slip into the liquor sto', sippin on a fifth
Yeah nigga, brang in the bag
Gangbang on you motherfuckers claimin the flag
West coast nigga, I'm a real go-getter
40 ounce sipper, the blackjack tripper
20 Cripper, 10-to-1 I flip her
Got the hook-up on the birds and the motherfuckin zippers
Go to the club with my thugs sell drugs
And I might get a girl but I ain't gon' tip her (uh-uh)
Get malt liquor, spit, mo' slicker
Put y'all hands in the air muh'fucker it's a stick up
Naw nigga eat a dick up
You say you a pimp, but you in love with a stripper
Just bounce to the beat, and don't pay me no attention
Just bounce to the beat, bounce bounce to the beat
{It, it makes me want to bounce!} To the beat
{It makes me want to bounce!} To the beat
{It makes me want to..} bounce bounce bounce to the beat

E'rybody in this muh'fucker wanna mean mug

Make a nigga wanna bounce {BOUNCE!}
Make a nigga burn an ounce {BOUNCE!}

My nigga Short Dawg in the house
Yeah make a nigga wanna bounce {BOUNCE!}

Nigga Short Dawg in the house

[Too $hort]
Beotch! I told the DJ play her song
Watch her choose up, put a player on
Put her in the wifey zone
She can be my girlfriend all night long
Keep bouncin, the floor is sweatin
I'm all on her booty, I know I'm gettin it
We from the West coast, we live fun lives
Freak these hoes 'til the sunrise
What time is it, late night
Send her back home when it's daylight
Her nigga at the house with a cake like
Captain Save-a-Hoe, but she ain't right
She like to play hard to get
She don't wanna dance she wants some hard dick
Well give her what she wants
Stick it in the hoe, and watch her go dumb {DUMB}

Make a bitch wanna bounce {BOUNCE!}
Short Dawg turn 'em out {BOUNCE!}
Bitch, don't you wanna bounce {BOUNCE!}
My nigga Snoop Dogg in the house
Make the bitch wanna bounce {BOUNCE!}
Short Dawg turn 'em out {BOUNCE!}
Bitch, don't you wanna bounce {BOUNCE!}
My nigga Will.I.Am in the house

[Will.I.Am]
I'm in the house and I ain't movin out
The girls keep more of my name in they mouth
I like breasts best when they poppin out
So girl bring 'em out, bring 'em out, I make 'em bounce
{"Keep, keep bouncing!"} Yeah just keep them bouncing
Open up your mind and accept what I'm announcing
If we have a President's Day and a Veteran's Day
Let's have a Titty Holiday
And lick on nipple everyday through the weekend
I like tit like fish like sippin
Watchin boobies bounce is my favorite tradition
When I'm up in the club just sittin and wishin
them boobies was bouncin on my head (my head)
Them boobies was bouncin on my head (my head)
Bouncin, bouncin on my head (my head)
I want them boobies bouncin on my head (my head)
Okay, now let me change the subject
I usually don't be gettin mannish up in public
But that's aight, cause I'm chillin with my folks
From the West coast Short Dawg's in the house ("Whattup loc?")
Snoop Dogg's in the house (in the house)
The nigga Too $hort's in the house (in the house)
Wuh-Will.I.Am's in the house (in the house)
Wuh-West coast make 'em bounce {"Keep, keep bouncing!"}
