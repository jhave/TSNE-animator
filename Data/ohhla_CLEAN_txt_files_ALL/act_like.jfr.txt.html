Uh, Big Will, and Tra-Knox, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Verse One: Will Smith]
JUMP, Move when I tell you make ya way up to the FRONT
Addicted to the way I kick it, I know what you WANT
The don jiggy, catering to what you FEELING
Pack it from the floor up to the ceiling
SHAKE, whatcha momma gave ya baby don't let nothin', BREAK
Ya watch, cause we both can't have much time it's gonna TAKE
Dance floor packed, it's looking like a LAKE
OF SEDUCTION, here's your instructions, SLIDE
Get up off that wall girl, stop tryna HIDE
Tracking aphrodisiac, don't be DENIED
Chill wit that cigarette, take it out SIDE
Messing wit my vibe, I DON'T LIKE THAT, BOUNCE
I'ma pressure playa Im'a hit it when it COUNTS
Party like a lamb and the whip about to BOUNCE
The don jiggy, catering to what you FEELING
Pack it from the floor up to the ceiling, come on

[Chorus: Tra-Knox]
Bring it on or nothin'
Ain't no time for frontin'
Come on, just let it flow
Jump off, act like you know
Get on the floor it's jumpin'
Ooh these girls are somethin'
Come on, just let it flow
Jump off, act like you know

[Verse Two: Will Smith]
I, I, I, I called Jazzy Jeff on the PHONE
I said I'm downstairs waitin' joker COME ON
I told him it's this hot spot that we GOTTA BURN
He said man after last weekend haven't YOU LEARNED
Look here dunny last weekend was a MISTAKE
That mami tryna dish it out, when she COULDN'T TAKE
Come at me dancin' wild like as soon as a GAME
One little move on her, and she burst into FLAMES (Whoosh)
The whole club runnin', tryna ruin my NIGHT
I told roll around a little, she be ALRIGHT
Now everybody mad at me, all up in my FACE
Somebody shoulda told that girl to stay in her PLACE
Ya feel a little heat baby girl I'm BEHIND YA
And hopefully ya burnt Gucci dress will REMIND YA
How serious I am, maybe it's CRAZY Y'ALL
But if you wanna play honey, GO GET A BABY DOLL, holla at me

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Will Smith]
HUH, check to make sure I'm lookin' cute for her
HUH, check to make sure I'm packin' loot for her
HUH, cause I'm bout to shut down the bar for her
HUH, and later open up my car door for her
HUH, seven begin, my lead, the set and THEN
No more actin', BACK TO RAPPIN' AGAIN
Red carpet, hectic, gettin' ME IN
What happened last week, SURE CAN HAPPEN AGAIN
Mos Def, ON bump, WHEN YA, hear the BOUNCE, front
Looking like the Jet Magazine Beauty of the MONTH
Shades on now ya layin' low on the CUT
Told myself you the one to shake it up, with
BOUNCE, over to ya table came completely UNANNOUNCED
Observed the curves, body fat about an OUNCE
Though almost bumpin' out of dangerous AMOUNTS
Grab ya arm, turn around girl, JUMP
Move when I tell make ya way up to the FRONT
Addicted to the way I kick it, I know what you WANT
The don jiggy, catering to what you FEELING
Pack it from the floor up to the ceiling, come on

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

Come on
Jump off
Get on the floor it's jumpin'
Come on, just let it flow
Jump off, act like you know

[Will Smith]
Big Will, Tra-Knox
Foundation laid, to the vibe y'all
We out, what</pre>
