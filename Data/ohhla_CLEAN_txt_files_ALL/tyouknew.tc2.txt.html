[Mac-Shawn]
Beyetch! Young Daz, Mac-n-ac-Shawn and Forty Fonzarelli, bitch
It's all about the money in the telly
Gangstas and killers, mob and coke dealers

Mac-Shawn don't play games, I snatch a nigga by his chain
and make him drop to a lesser and kiss the pinky ring
You shouldn't played wit your life and now I really want it
Ya see we're bigger than smokin blunts and on the corner
Cos it's The Mob, The Click, The Gang
I bust rounds, I get down, I'm pound for pound
To 40 sellin, how you niggas likin me now?
Pack a Rueger P-89, gone on Carlos Rossi wine
Remember that, nigga we backed, still got money, sippin yac
Square ass niggas tip your hat
before I make that ass kiss the mat
One-one, nigga get done, cats should've never bought your tongue
Bitch ass niggas run for cops
Now we got to shut your block, DOWN...
YAKNOW...all the way down....YAKNOW....

Chorus:  Daz Dillinger, (Mac-Shawn)

I thought you knew				(I thought you knew)
But now you know				(But now you know)
Don't ever ever come around here no mo'		(Uhh)
And why's that?					(And why's that?)
And why not?					(And why not?)
This is our money and we mash for our block	(For our block)			
I thought you knew				(I thought you knew)
But now you know				(But now you know)
Don't ever ever come around here no mo'		(Uhh)
And why's that?					(Why's that?)
And why not?					(And why not?)
This is our money and we mash for our block

[Mac-Shawn]
I'm use ta choppers and AK's, stay the fuck out my way
It's that nigga Mac-Shawn, one of the bosses out the Bay
Represent cocaine, weed, speed, heroin, hop
Ride around town in a Mustang drop
My mug mean I'm lookin clean, sea pane gleam
like a white dia-mond, prince cut
My mackin is tough in the club and I stay fucked up
Jew-el dot, iced out and the Persianly
is wrapped tight around the palm
and on my back is a hog and dem rocks
Is that what makes me? A hog and stuff?
And my motto from day one was to floss and ball
and ride and side until the wheels fall
And this is for my hogs and all my doggs
[Daz] And to ya sucker ass niggas this for alla y'all
[Mac-Shawn] Motherfuckers!!!

Chorus:

I thought you knew				(I thought you knew)
But now you know				(But now you know)
Don't ever ever come around here no mo'		(No mo')
And why's that?					(Why's that?)
And why not?					(Why not?)
This is our money and we mash for our block	(For our block)			
I thought you knew				(I thought you knew)
But now you know				(But now you know)
Don't ever ever come around here no mo'		(No mo')
And why's that?					(Why's that?)
And why not?					(Why not?)
This is our money and we mash for our block	(For our block)

Glasses rarely hangin off my nose
You wanna smell me, lookin thru my (Lookin thru your what?)
Brand new Oliver peoples' lambses... (BEEYATCH!!!)
Marbles buried and me and Mac-Shawn grab Mob and em in the backyard
on the thingamajig and the cuttalufagus, drawin interest
Just to hop and hit fences
Now we rappin and scattin business
Off the hinges, some big time motherfuckers in the business (business)
Steady long, steady wrong
I was that sasqwatch pimpin ass un-estimated ass nigga
that most of you square dancin ass niggas slept on

Understand that, eh look here

My little cousin Mac-Shawn ya understand it
