[Mauberg]
Check me out baby, I'm Mr. Mausberg
As you can see I done got off that curb
Now what you think about me?
Never mind just keep watch
Cus what I want you don't got
Call me The Superb as I'm chockin on designer herb
Rollin with Suga free and Clue Dog, oh you didn't heard?
Now I can do magic, baby like abracadabra
Floatin like a butterfly, lovin when I'm stabin it
Check out the sequel, I'm the franchise and you the fries
Baby why you wanna start? You rollin wit your eyes
I was tripin when, you was the bomb and I was broke
Now it's (disc scratching) so it's anotha quote
Let me break it down to anotha compound
Rags to riches and this bitch got down
God bless ya, It's Mausberg forgive ya
You wanna give me some mouth? girl I'm down with ya
Ahhh

Chorus:[James Debarge]
I just wanna meet cha
I didn't wanna waste yo time
Cus we do it any way any way any way that you want to
I just wanna meet cha
I didn't wanna waste yo time
Cus we do it any way any way any way in a real way

[Mausberg]
Now I don't give a damn about a feline
If she don't give a damn about me, I'm from the CPT
And all the kissin ass purp and the fries be shakin the spot
When I'm rollin with my fellow pimp stackin a knot
I know I'm the bomb, and I know you do too
But yo attitude is stanky like some doo doo
And I'm international, gamin tricks like a poo stick
All my problems, I be solvin with my tip
Now you can break it down, to whatever compound
Mausberg the superb known to put the swipe it down
Hit it from the back, and make you moan and cry
Put your back in it baby, cus the pleasure is mine
It aint no fakin, just thug love makin
Tellin you to lay down and get up
Baby you got some good stuff
So I'm give you a pass
Make sure to keep you in touch, cus I'ma shoot you with??pad?? now

Chorus:[James Debarge]
I just wanna meet cha
I didn't wanna waste yo time
Cus we do it any way any way any way that you want to
I just wanna meet cha
I didn't wanna waste yo time
Cus we do it any way any way any way in a real way

[Suga Free]
I gots the have it
Even if I have to get up, kick rocks, 
collect hairs, and recycle me some plastic
In a real way, Baby can you buy this?
Yeah, okay, I didn't think you could
But I'm always talking expensive gifts 
and livin in a quiet neighborhood
Excuse me baby, but I think I feel like walkin wit you
Don't hold my hand
I aint gonna repeat my self 
and look at me in the eye when I'm talking to you
Suga Free ha ha
I tell you what, bet she handles her business though
Baby all up in my ?? and don't even know what the hell they wanna ?? though
Now when she gets mad and she do things(Yeah)
Cus baby have game, and she be havin her thang right?(Yeaheeeyeaheeya)
But don't be checkin with passion when we massion(Oh yeah)
Should I cyber slap me a mama?(Wow!)
Partner you better pause
From the pen to all juvenile halls
When game recognize game bangin off walls, for these hardheaded ass broads
Straight told the police I had her down in the sherm
They raided the spot
But all they smelled was nail polish, poparine, and brand new perm

Chorus:[James Debarge](2x)
I just wanna meet cha
I didn't wanna waste yo time
Cus we do it any way any way any way that you want to
I just wanna meet cha
I didn't wanna waste yo time
Cus we do it any way any way any way in a real way

In a real way! (Repeat till fade)</pre>
