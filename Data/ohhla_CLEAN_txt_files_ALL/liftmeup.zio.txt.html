[Verse 1-Zion]
Hey, I made a promise to myself, I said I'd trust me
Know that God done chose my wealth, I adjust, he
I was so stuck up in a funk, it was hard to just get up
But then I ate away the bump, then I was set free
Lawdy! I'm set free, nothin' can touch me
Even when the road of life, it get bumpy
I be chillin' with my trues, sneakers for my shoes
Never slip sideways, all I do is sing blues
Used to mash the gas, now controls set on cruise
Used to need a breezy, now it sound like old news
Years passin' by, but the faces in the crew
Man, they always stay the same, keep it tight, I thought you knew?
And I'm feelin' so thankful, my cup runneth...
Over, gettin' closer to the summit
In this lifetime, givin' y'all all that I can
Feel the memories and words in the heart of a man, yeah

[Hook]
It's so unusual
'Cause I feel so fly today
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's somethin' beautiful
Lifts Me Up, I fly away, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2-The Grouch]
Lucky labeled me the Duke of Earl
But now that seems like a past life, shoot, you could twirl
When eighty, but baby, me I'm not a ballerina
Maybe I was crazy, I learned a lot and seen a
Large portion of the globe, though
Old habits, rabbit like, now I enjoy it more and probe slow
Keep goin' up, I feel the synergy
Created with my woman since '98 'til Infinity
And Zion I, by and by, see eye to eye
A Legend's work is never done, we try and try
I heard it said, that things go in cycles
The way that I'ma work it, pay attention to the light bulbs
Be rightful, owners upon us
The next moments, check your vitals, the bone isn't so much
Don't go nuts before you turn to accumulate
Your greatest gifts, learn to appreciate

[Hook]
It's so unusual
'Cause I feel so fly today
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's somethin' beautiful
Lifts Me Up, I fly away, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's so unusual
'Cause I feel so fly today
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's somethin' beautiful
Lifts Me Up, I fly away, yeah, yeah, yeah</pre>
