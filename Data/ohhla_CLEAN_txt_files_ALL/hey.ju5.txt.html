Hey...hey, hey

[Soup]
Now, if theres a party theres about to be
Then let me start queing up the frequency
Six members, fresh spinners, we make the fly ladies say...
	Hey...Hey
The Shak-Zulu shot a rhyme right through you
Now your don't want static with my crew now, Do you?
C.A. all day, we make the party people say...
	Hey...Hey
Check it, regardless what you heard this year
The party atmosphere is only crackin' right here
And uh, we givin' you the theme that ya want
Cha come clean if ya want, know what I mean
If ya don't because...

[All]
We just wanna get you out
To the party everybodys talkin' bout

[Soup]
And you dont have to worry bout a fee
Ya see its all vi-a-vi
Because you're rollin' with me and uh...

[All]
We just wanna get you out
To the party everybodys talkin' bout

[Marc 7]
Yo, we thought we'd come a little different
Somethin' unscripted
Push up our percentage
Rip it like we meant it
Vintage verses
Sentence wordsmith
Here with no delay
Relax and don't decay
Turn to the DJ
He can make ya people say...
	Hey...Hey

[Akil]
Yeah, yeah, party people in the place to be
It's all live cause the party is packed
	(No straps, just raps)
Sweat drippin' ain't nobody set trippin'
All the ladies testifyin' to that...
	Hey...hey
Ay yo I'm feelin' the vibe
Take you on a natural high
Boogie wonderland cause we gon' party tonight, yo

[All]
Cause we just wanna party wit you...
	Hey...hey
Open up your mind and let the vibe flow through (Uh)
Cause you dont have to worry bout a thing
Let the rhythm heal your brain
While the party people sing (Hey!)

[Chali 2na]
Yo, the more you offer, displayin' your inner visions
Oral officers will be freein' your inhibitions
So skip an intermission and suddenly parlay
Cause movers are hot pumpin' in butter from parkay
You wonderin' what that prehistoric force is
Make you scream...
	Hey...hey
Like a heard of hungry horses
Yes, the music you approached me with was inappropriate
Cause me and my associates are closely knit shit
The main course on the menu for today say...
	Hey...hey
	(talking in background)
	Hey...hey

[Soup]
Now if theres a party for the gangstas here
The DJ's spinnin' records you don't wanna here
To have it your way
Participate and make him play...
	Hey...hey
I represent it, get wit it for the hood
The lights is turned low and the mood is all good
Whether you parlay
Or on the dance floor say...
	Hey...hey
Regardless what you heard this year
The party atmosphere is only crackin' right here
And uh, we givin' you the theme that ya want
Cha come clean if ya want, know what I mean
If ya don't because...

[All]
We just wanna get you out
To the party everybodys talkin' bout

[Soup]
And you don't have to worry it's enough
No guest lists and stuff because you're rollin' with us
Now if theres a party theres about to be
Then let me start queing up the frequency
Six members fresh spinners, we make the fly ladies say...
	Hey...Hey
C'mon, The Shak-Zulu shot a rhyme right through you
Now your don't want static with my crew now, Do you?
C.A. all day, to make the party people say...
	Hey...Hey
	(talking in background)
	Hey...hey, hey
	(talking in background)
	Hey...hey

(Sample)	**And all round you people are screaming,
		nation tan, nation tan, nation tan, nation tan
		shit, here it come again, here it come again,
		here it come again, here it come again,
                here it come again**</pre>
