[Chorus 2x]
Saw you on the dance floor and
I love the way you're movin'
You sure know what you're doin'
Hey girl you're turnin' me on

[Verse 1]
The girls all pause when I walk into the room
Baggied up with cologne
They're prettied up with perfume, I
Feel like I wanna, strut my thing
Baby girl, you wanna dance?
You got a nice small frame
Look at you, the way you move
You got some moves, but I bet you didn't know
I got some moves that don't lose follow me
Look at everybody's eyes, they're all on me
Spotlights follow me for all to see
Honestly, L-I-L-R-O-B
Be where the parties be, people wanna see me
Starring me, I see, It's true
I don't mean to sound like that
But check the soundscan mija, cause I sound like that
Now I don't wear a diamond ring
I just know the jams to bring
You're the type of girl
That I would love to be handling
Wait a minute, keep doin' what you're doin'
I love the way you're movin'
Girl where the hell have you been?

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
I'm club hoppin', ladies got their mouth's droppin'
Their heart's stoppin', ???
Been around since the beginning of pop-lockin'
Bad walkin', bad like back talkin'
The club is poppin', off the hook
Like I feel when the bed's rockin'
The night ain't done, till I'm lip lockin'
Got the chicks flockin'
Feelin' fresh, I got the zip locked in
You only live once, my time is only tick tockin'
Workin' it up, I'm livin' it up
The bartender and the DJ's are mixin' it up
I'm drinkin' it up, as now people start to show up
Asked this pretty girl to dance
And then I rip the floor up
Hey can I dance with you? Take a little chance on you
What a glance will do
Well look at the tight pants on you
Movin' so fine, you're lookin' so fine
Everytime we're partyin', you're blowin' my mind

[Chorus 2x]

Hey girl, I saw you from across the room and
I love the way you're movin'
Keep doin' what you're doin'
Girl where the hell have you been?

[Verse 3]
Let's leave this place and go to another place
???, baby give me a taste
I love your face, I love your waist
Shaped like a vase
You, I will chase
Why must I be like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
If you saw a girl as fine as you
Girl, you would chase that
Ain't nothin' but the Rob in me
Lettin' out the dog in me
Fools try to block it, I block 'em
There's no blockin' me
This happens constantly
This is constantly happenin'
Leave it alone or leave your ass home
I came to, rock the party and wake the dance floor up
What's the matter?
You ain't got no kind of class or what? Back up

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
