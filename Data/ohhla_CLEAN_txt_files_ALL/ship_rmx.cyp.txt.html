Typed by: dalyricalmaster@tupac.com

Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down

(B-Real)
Livin on phat pockets on flat wit tha gat 
Rollin around nine deuce Cadillac 
Still got my homies to watch my back 
And they'll smoke ya ass if ya wanna come chat 
That's why some pigs an tha kids come sweatin 
They follow a hollow point shells hard ta swallow 
Why wallow when ya come ta roll on I put tha clip 
An dust bring ya ass on
Kickin dust on ya head as tha gat busts my grip surrounded 
I'm about ta get rushed I brushed wit death 
How many shells stuffed in my closet (???) 

(Chorus)
(B-Real)
When tha ship goes down ya better be ready (when tha ship goes down) 
When tha ship goes down ya better be ready (when tha ship goes down) 
When tha ship goes down ya better be ready (when tha ship goes down) 
When tha ship goes down ya better be ready (ya better be ready) 

Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down

(B-Real)
I told tha boyz get tha sawed off glock 
And tha rest of tha gats as I strapped on tha bullet-proof vest BOOM 
I think I got one to tha chest hot damn I didn't want to kill a man 
Shit I still stand tall with tha hill clan y'all 
Better stand back niggaz bout ta fall I'm comin out blastin like Yosemite Sam 
Get tha cheese an tha bread for tha ham 

(Chorus)
(B-Real)
When tha ship goes down ya better be ready (when tha ship goes down)
When tha ship goes down ya better be ready (when tha ship goes down) 
When tha ship goes down ya better be ready (when tha ship goes down)
When tha ship goes down ya better be ready (ya better be ready)

Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down
Goin down, goin down</pre>
