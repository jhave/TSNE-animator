[Chorus: Barrington Levy &amp; Guru]
I don't wanna (2x)(Come on)
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna (2x)

Ohho she's the one for me
Fly sexy girl she's the one for me
Ohho she's the one for me
My pure ghetto princess
Ohho she's the one for me
Didn't (didn't I) I blow your mind, that's right
Didn't (didn't I) make you shine, true
Didn't (didn't I) make you mine, that's right

Ghetto princess she's the one for me
Ohho she's the one for me
The lover of my life she's the one for me

[Verse 1: Guru]
I took her out the club just to show her love
She said; there's no-one above
And right after we rubadub
All alone at her rest
She placed my head to her chest
She said I was the best, God bless
I like the way she's on-point
Turnin' heads every time when she steps in the joint

[Barrington Levy &amp; Guru]
Ohho she's the one for me, that's the girl for me
Ohho she's the girl for me, sexy girl she's the girl for me
Ohho she's the one for me
Fly sexy mama she's the one for me

[Barrington Levy &amp; Guru &amp; Jigsy King]
I don't wanna (2x)
I don't wanna lose her
I don't wanna (2x)
I don't wanna (2x)
I don't wanna lose her
Ohho she's the one (girl) for me
Pure ghetto princess she's the one (girl) for me
The sexy mama she's the one for me
Didn't I blow your mind, THIS TIME
Didn't I make you mine, THIS TIME
Didn't I make you shine
Didn't I oh oh oh ohho

(Verse 3: Jigsy King singing/rapping)
