[Verse 1]
In all black with the hard bottoms
Cop the daily news, skimming through the car columns
Making my way to the Pentecostal Church of Ebenezer with the grievers
They just killed Beaver for his sneakers
It's a fever on the ave, undercovers playing cabs
Raiding niggas labs, Lou Lav just got stabbed in his abs
It's sad, recession hitting niggas real hard
It forced a few jailbirds to go get jobs
Some'll starve, everything's a go in the hood
Sixteen little niggas sniffing blow in the hood
Set claiming, bandanas boosting their aiming
Shells ricocheting, shit ain't no use in complaining
Mama praying, the cancer done ate her calves
So the doc had to decapitate the leg in half
Do the math, it's over if I can't coach soon
Could have easily been the victim of a hot dope spoon, word to June

[Chorus]
Get money, motherfucker get right
Get a blunt, get a bottle, get nice
Get a grip cause as soon as you slip, that's it
Set trip nigga, get life
Get money, motherfucker get right
Get a blunt, get a bottle, get nice
Get a grip cause as soon as you slip, that's it
Set trip nigga, get life

[Verse 2]
So my options don't vary, I'm holding like Dirty Harry
In a truck like I'm supposed to marry, so savvy
Sadly, I'm like a sick psychiatric
Finger on the ratchet, the feeling's so immaculate
No attachments, it's ice in my veins
To put it point blank, I ain't right in the brain
Politeness remains though I strike with the fangs
So strange, at night you can see them when they hang
What a shame, murder on the quietest block
The specialist, like somebody hired a cop
It's syphilis, I'm just trying to do what it do
Metaphoric for the pulpit, the eulogy's true
The toolery's glue, in and out the sooner we through
I been about cars, money, clout and jewelry too
Louis the who? 13th, with nothing to chase
So why ask? Here's the facts, I'm a basket case

[Chorus]
Get money, motherfucker get right
Get a blunt, get a bottle, get nice
Get a grip cause as soon as you slip, that's it
Set trip nigga, get life
Get money, motherfucker get right
Get a blunt, get a bottle, get nice
Get a grip cause as soon as you slip, that's it
Set trip nigga, get life</pre>
