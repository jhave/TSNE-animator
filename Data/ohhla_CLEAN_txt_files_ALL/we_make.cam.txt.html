[Verse 1: Cam'Ron]
KILLA! YO!
I'm official nice (nice), y'all niggaz Fisher Price (price)
Fuck "trout" you bout....let's "fish for ice"!
This a risk that's light, get it right the vicious price ($50,000)
Plus my kicks are Nike...this what the bitches like
Like ya bitch and wife, and sister might get tonight
Mister right, kissed her right...make sure that her lips get white
She don't suck nothing, buzzen but she lick it nice
She a hummer, nah plumber she can "twist the pipe"
When I was fifteen, BANG BANG, I call my moms..
cell, she snorting long....that don't even correspond
All the Ganj, all is gone...just came from Autobon
Came back with the foreign palm.....I'LL HOLLAAAA!
Shit....before I go berserk, jerk when I sold it hurt
Eurth told me go to school....nah bitch go to work
And gave the coldest smirk, right after she stole my work
(where you going with my shit?!?!)
And the nerve to hold her purse.....I'LL HOLLAAAA!

[Verse 2: Cam'Ron]
Ok...here go the rundown, niggaz gonna run down, tell you put ya gun down
Puff puff puff, shutdown, uptown, in the house, hollaback, going around, done clown
I'ma do this fast or slow when I rap or when I bag a O
When I wrap that...pass that, catch that, fast that....motherfuckers had to know!
OH OH!...I'm about that cornbread, believe me I'm beyond dead
I do this for blood sheed, do it for Bloodshed, Derrick Michael Armstead
Me and him soul to soul, if you bowl ya fold, better slow ya role
Before ya role get popped and them hoes is hot from pole to pole! (WOOO!)
Lemme slow it up (why?), so y'all can cope in touch
I'm heroine and sex in one...dope as fuck
I'm hoping I'm roping the trojan
and go in the hole and open it up...if not dog I'm choking the slut
Am I poking or what? You got to figure dog
The game in a chicken wing, stupid "figure four"
I'm that nigga y'all......I just ball, best dressed, dress fresh, oh yes YES Y'ALL!
