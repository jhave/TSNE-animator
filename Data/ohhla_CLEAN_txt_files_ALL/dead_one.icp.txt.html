The Dead One

"You tried to stop me, remember?
You tried to deface your own creation
But I stopped you                           
Did it hurt, did you feel pain?"

[Violent J]
Guess it all began when the bullet finally struck
And I walked away harmless, it must of been good luck
Or maybe I'm dead, I'm sorry but you're dead
Maybe I outta go anyway

[Violent J]
Strange things have happened since this day accord
A can hear a cold whisper in my every word
It's telling me I'm dead, I'm sorry but you're dead (no)
Maybe I outta go anyway

[Violent J]
I'm feeling so stiff as I walk out the house
My tongue's so dry, think it's rotting in my mouth
Oh, tell me am I dead? I'm sorry but you're dead ("it hurts")
Life goes on for some
My boys all stare at me I wonder what they think
They don't blink and my teeth keep popping out I stink
Oh, tell me am I dead? I'm sorry but you're dead 
I don't wanna die, maybe I outta go if I'm dead

[Violent J]
My soul is so heavy that it draws me to the floor
I can hear these demons knocking at my door
They're laughing at the dead, I'm sorry but you're dead (no)
I don't wanna die, if you're dead, you're dead
I don't wanna die...you're dead, not yet now...
I don't wanna die...maybe I outta go
You're dead...I'm not goin' now...
I don't wanna die, maybe I outta go
Not yet now...
I don't wanna die...
I'm dead...
I don't wanna die...
you're dead
not yet
you're dead...
not yet

i speak

YOU'RE DEAD, BITCH HAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!
