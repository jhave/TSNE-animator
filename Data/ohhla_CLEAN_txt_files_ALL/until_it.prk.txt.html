[Mike Shinoda]
It goes a one
It goes a one, two, three
I was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when a competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I don't run the track, no I make the track run
My momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I hold 'em both together now, tell me what I got it's
Ia pretty smart weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it cause you clearly can't stop it, like that

It ain't over cause the shark's on the left side, the snake's on the right
And anything you do they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights
And as for me I do it like I got nothin to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier, I ain't standin next to you
I'll be layin on the ground before you're even in my view, like that

[Chester Bennington]
Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing
Bring me to kingdom come

[Mike Shinoda]
It's somethin for your people on the block to blackout and rock to
Give you what you need, like +Poppa+ "Who Shot Ya?"
Separate the weak from the obso-
-lete you meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all
Quit trippin I don't have time for your cryin
I grind tough sucker make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
Bang, bang, little monkey man playin
with the big guns only get you slain I ain't playin
I'm just sayin; you ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake shake down, money here's the break down
You can play the bank, I'ma play the bank take down
And no mistakes now I'm comin to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture? It's like that

[Chester Bennington]
We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more
So rest your head it's time to sleep
and dream of what's in store
The body bends until it breaks
and sings again no more
Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning, sings, no, more</pre>
