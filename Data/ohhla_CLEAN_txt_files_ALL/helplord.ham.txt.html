[Chorus 2x]
Tiddle-Dee-Dum, Tiddle-Dee-Dum
Help Lord, Won't You Come?

[Hammer]
I can't call it, But I know I got started
Cause my mama was broke, And I was broken hearted
I can take tears and tears for years
But the tears of my mama, Yo they get me right here
So i, Broke out in a military step
No deally, No dally, I walked, I crept
I slept on a plan that i'd make it all good
A young preacher if you could
A young hustler from the hood
Mama, Don't you cry, Don't you cry no more
Ya baby boy's blowin up and he's goin to war
My mind is playin tricks and my dad is too
High street bank boys, It's on, Fools!
Gonna make my moves and my moves I make
You betta not get broke cause if you broke, You break
I don't hesitate that you can't see me
It's gonna take the lord to save you from me

[Chorus 4x]

[Hammer]
I flipped the stress off, Good, I let it rip
Bank boys in the fat money grip, Yeah
Rollin 5 deep and on fools we creep
Half the town is down and you can't see me, Really dough
What's next? A young fool on a flex
Tryin to get a name, Some props, Or rep
I stepped right to him let em know it's all good
Lights out! Now his crib is wood
Broke for the dough, But now I can't see
It's blood on my hands my dog ''yo, g?''
I hit the flo, But my heart didn't stop
And noqw I see a vision of my son wit no pop
My mama's on her knees
Lord, Lord no please
And I feel cold and my health is cheatin
It's gettin dark, But yet and still
I'm half dead, Half life, What's real?
I can't breathe, But now i'm startin to choke
Off my own blood and not that indo smoke
No joke, Straight up, On a serious tip
I'm losin my life, I'm losin my grip
I slip, ssssslip deeper still
Help lord, Help lord, I'm losin my will
To live, Low, Stuck at the bottom
From winter to spring to summer to autumn
Help lord, The homies in the hood
The squares, The g's, It's all good
Help lord, Cause in the hood we sprung
And we stuck right here until you come
And bless the children of the ghetto life
No love, No hope, No hope, No life
Help lord, Help Lord, Help lord, Help lord
You hear me callin lord?

[Chorus Till Fade]</pre>
