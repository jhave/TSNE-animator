[Intro]
I'm the man 'round here, capiche?
Brown paper bag, ol' dope boy money
Ol' dope boy money

[Chorus]
I'm the man 'round here, capiche?
Small face hundred, ninety-fo' money
Brown paper bag, ol' dope boy money
Ol' dope boy money

[Shawty Lo]
Easily I approach
The microphone, yeah the kid's no joke
Tell your hoe to get off of my dick
Hypnotized by this shit that I spit
Yeahh, slow flow new flavor in your ear
I used to swear man talk was cheap
Now I'm gettin twenty thousand fee
DAAAAMN~! 20 thousand to speak?
Seventeen-five if you want a ki'
Get a 10-pack, 17 apiece
I'm the man 'round here, capiche?
Call me Big Bird like Sesame Street

[Chorus] - 2X

[Shawty Lo]
Shawty what'chu doin? Ain't doin nuttin
Cookin up a chicken cause the rent due, money
Fifty-five hundred, they ain't know money
Magic City money, still blowin money
Body Tap Wednesday, still throwin money
"Units in the City" I done sold another hundred
Small faced hundreds, ninety-four money
Brown paper bag, ol; dope boy money
Man I'm a stunna, nigga youse a fronter
Nigga youse a bitch and you get it from your momma
Real brick runner, nigga on the corner
On my grandmama, got more chickens than a farmer

[Chorus] - 2X

[Shawty Lo]
Early in the mornin, slippers and pajamas
Got 'em get 'em ready cause them country boys is comin
And I don't believe in karma, I believe in numbers
Add mo' zeroes, I need more commas
Back in Tijuana, mighty close to water
Can get 'em from the border, break 'em down in Georgia
Seventeen-five, make 'em where you can afford 'em
Where yo' peoples at? Tell 'em go on and place they order

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
