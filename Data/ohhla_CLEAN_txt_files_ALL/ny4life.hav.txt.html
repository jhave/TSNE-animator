[Havoc]
These niggas acting like a nigga never paid his dues
But all the while, these faggots would of walked up in my shoes
Exotic whips, they see me in, they think it's fun and games
Like I ain't have to struggle on the corner slinging 'caine
Crackhead short with it, pay me when it first came
And bet that ass that I was on 'em when the first came
A far cry from the fortune and the fucking fame
Snot nose rappers coming at me, is you fucking playing?
I got a icebox where my heart used to be
Shit, we can get into some gangsta shit, it's cool with me
Been through it all, ain't that much that you can do to me
I feel you baby, you just fronting for publicity
Front page pose for this nine milli'
I suppose, you know how it go, don't act silly
With a blow, leave 'em froze, yeah, it's a cold city
Only fucks with my homeys, stood in the cold with me
Now pour the Henny

[Chorus: Havoc]
Don't worry bout me, I'm right where I'm 'pose to be
Mad at me, cuz they not where they think they should
I'm here, I'm there, I'm in your hood
Late night creeping, cuz you know I could
And if we get it on, then it's meant to be
I'm smiling at the judge, when he sentenced me
My IQ, ain't no testing me
Straight N.Y., nigga, every breath of me

[Havoc]
The money and the drugs, freak hoes or the whips
I'm a boss, I can recognize how real the shit could get
CSI got 'em bugging, I ain't leave a fucking print
Not a shell, I ain't even tell my bottom ass bitch
If the world could talk, probably clap before the walls could talk
Call me crazy, Don Bishop in this muthafucka, boy
Get it right, get it twisted, they be knocking down your door
Early morn', at ya mama house, praying to the lord
What my baby done did now, your baby ain't a baby
He done left a nigga down, loyal money, no bomb
Quick he need a speedy trail, call my dunny, need to find out
Who running they fucking mouth, find that muthafucka
Cuz you know we gotta take 'em out, I ain't trynna sit around
Seeing how it plays out, I need some answers
And I need 'em for the days out, for they hammer ass
Up in super max, no breaking out

[Chorus]</pre>
