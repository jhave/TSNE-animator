Song:   I Got Da Feelin'
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

I got this feelin, and it's makin me break in-
to a cold sweat whenever I'm present
It doesn't matter how long
If you wasn't down from now on
You'll be around to count on
This feeling, put you down with the program
Like I am
So just dance till you feel how I feel now
Sweet Tee's cold rockin the crowd
Turn up the music, I'm a fanatic
Make it heard from basement to attic
Keepin you hooked like an addiction
Sweet Tee is fact, not fiction
On the records you hear me rhymin
On the charts you see me climbin
To the top of the deck, and I'm dealin
Sweet Tee's in effect, and I got the feelin

Now's the time, so check your timex
Hold tight while I take you to the climax
Of the music, yeah, that'll work
Get on the dancefloor, go bezerk
Tee is here to let you know
That you others got to go
I'm steppin hard, steppin strong
Step out my way or, get stepped on
I entertain, make you go insane
Stick with me when I'm on the mic, and
You'll feel no pain, I'll keep you up
Like a cup of Saeco
Get down like a sailboat anchor
I'm on a roll, and I'm wheelin
I'm Sweet Tee, and I got the feelin

Stop and - ehm, listen to the rhythm of
Sweet Tee, then fall in love
Cause I'm hype, Tee's on the mic
When I do it, I do it right
[Name] is on the cuts and
She makes party people shake their butts and
She gets busy, she ain't no joke
And with Tee on the mic - you know we dope
In demand, as I expand
I know how
So here and now
I'll take my stand
This ain't no game, I ain't playin
Listen to the words I'm sayin
At the top of the deck, and I'm dealin
Sweet Tee's in effect, and I got the feelin

Now what I want you to do is
Get wet
Let yourself perspire
Get hot like your body's on fire
Get ready, so you can observe
The man with the beats - make it funky, Hurb

If it feels good, then prove it
On the dancefloor, y'all, move it
Start sweatin, cause I'm lettin me
Be real good, no one's forgettin me
I'm good to go, yo
I'm not a amateur, Tee's a pro, so
I give no slack
Cause it's like that
I'll be back, jack
Cause I got the feelin

If it feels good
(She's got it)		(2x)

If it feels good, then prove it
On the dancefloor, y'all, move it</pre>
