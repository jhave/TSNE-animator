Psychopathic family baby, it's goin' down
Cryptic Collection, Twiztid baby

[Monoxide]
Karate choppin' motherfuckers like kiyah
Lord of the Rings, I'll make the dragon breathe fire
It won't stop till my heartbeat expires
And then I keep it going till the underground retires
We keep it darker than a vampire
With your body in my trunk, with my bumps and my spare tire
M-O-N-O-X-I-D-E
When disaster strikes, it looks just like me
I'm a controlled substance and I'm abused by most
I'm a plague that'll wipe out most of the east coast
Come with me, run with me, try to escape
We love, not hate, now can you relate
Burning me inside with the pain of never knowing
Can't explain why the rain don't change, it keeps glowing
I'm a lightning rod, rocking the dead
A little bit frigtening and odd but I never forget

[Jamie Madrox]
Twiztid in this bitch, double O, double O
Yeah we crash any nemesis, Jamie Madrox, got shaped like a jellyfish
Like a succubis, brain of a scientist
I'm the abominable beast from the east
I'm the walker of dimension X in search of inner peace
I'm everywhere and nowhere at the same time
Scales of the book, a savior of mine remains mummified inside
Inside, where all the negativity goes
Sprayed down with herbicide so love will never grow in this host
And I'm changing forms
Scared to death to come in view of great thunderstorms, thunderstorms
It hurts for worse, lightning never strike in the same place twice
You got to be precise to exist in the midst of the don't say shit
To the maniacs with eyes in backs of they head</pre>
