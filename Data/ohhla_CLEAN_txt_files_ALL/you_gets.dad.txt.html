Intro: Faith Evans (P. Diddy)
Uh, uh-uh, (There's another one)
What-what (And another one)
This is the remix (There's another one) Ha ha
I know it's not too ghetto (And another one, Bad Boy)
I know it's not too ghetto
Pedigree (Pedigree baby) I said I know it's not to ghetto
Donaway (Faith, Faithfully, the remix)
You better, check yourself respect yourself
You better go for self because I flow for self

[Verse 1: Faith Evans]
I'll tell you why there's no love, simply you're not cool enough
For what we had between us, don't you know you lost my trust
People ask me where you've been (Where you've been)
And I tell them were just friends (Tell them we're just friends)
Cause it's so obvious that it's never gonna work for us
No no oh no (No)

[Chorus]
Played with my emotions (Played)
You gets no devotion (And you gets no love, gets no love)
You can't get no love from me
You can't even be my friend (Be my friend)
And you gets no love again
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch
(You gets no love from me)

[Verse 2: Faith Evans]
Tell you why we can't hook up (You gets no love)
Cause I had about enough (You gets no love)
Hearin all the lies you tell (You gets no love)
Boy I thought I knew you well
People think that your my man (People think that your my man)
They don't even understand (They don't even understand)
Just because I let you get some that don't make you the one
We ain't even in love (You know you played with my....)

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Played with my emotions You gets no devotion
You gets no love, you can get no love from me
You can't even be my friend (Can't be my friend)
And you gets no love again
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch

Bridge: Faith Evans (P. Diddy)
(P.Diddy: Yo! Faith let 'em know!!)
You better, rock my shit don't knock my shit
Because I got the shit that make you cop my shit
I know y'all sick of this Bad Boy diva
That blows and plus got flows ridiculous
You better, rock my shit don't knock my shit
Because I got the shit that make you cop my shit
It's the chick from the bricks that got the hot shit
Left you sick from the single now check the remix
Boy you had a clue, thought we had a cool relationship
But you couldn't handle it (You couldn't handle it)

[Verse 3: G. Dep] (P.Diddy)
Yo! At the end of the day what a playa 'gon do? (Badboy)
You got love for me, It's how supposed to be
Same love I'm a land on you (Come on)
Right back at you it's only natural
So what I'm gon' do? Me
Everything love ain't always lovely
Leave it all up to me, I'll be livin in luxury, sucker free
Without no lies without no ties to those that patronize
That's why I don't socialize
I eat, shit, even sleep with open eyes
Just, give me that gasoline
I'll move in the jag few bags of green
Couple ads in the magazine
All freezy and I'm easy G Deezy one

[Chorus]
Played with my emotions, you gets no devotion
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch
You can't even be my friend, cause you gets no love again
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again

[Outro]
You played with my emotions and you gets no devotion
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again
You played with my emotions and you gets no devotion
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Played with my emotions You gets no devotion
You gets no love, you can get no love from me
You can't even be my friend (Can't be my friend)
And you gets no love again
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch</pre>
