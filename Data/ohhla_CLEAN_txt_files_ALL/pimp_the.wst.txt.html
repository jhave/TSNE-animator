Hold on let me see what this daddy here
Ok this the bitch here right now you know what i'm saying
Hey bitch, what's happening
Yea bitch, yea yea bitch I told you, I told you were gonna get it
I told you you were gonna be able to get it
Don't you worry about it
I already know what you trying to say bitch
Yea bitch yea bitch only thing you do bitch is just go to work
Had on my bussines, get my money and don't get me no problems
And everything gonna be alright
(Whooa, pimp the system)
Because it ain't easy man
It may look glamour to you cause you see me ridin'
Snake skin down to the floor you hear
Platinum shoes and more
Diamonds on fingers and watches on arms
I'm telling you it may look easy baby
But you gonna have to work hard
To get to this point
See you at the top

[Ice cube]
I never pimp a ho, nigga pimp a CEO
Be my He-e-ro, make me mad as ze-e-ro
Im that ne-e-gro making it like itchy-ro
Ain't got time for no bow ass bitchy ho
Go to G-e-sale fuckin with them e-e-mails
I'd rather get my shit wide nigga e-e-mail
Fuck a sex slavior make what I just made
That bitch had to sell her pussy for a decade
And that's too much time for the brainy one
I'm on a daily run
To crack your cranium
Wrap uranium
Ain't nothin else
I pimp the system
Bitch break yourself
If they got scrilla
Then I'm gorilla
If they figure
I'm a killa
Cause I'm a nigga
Your prostitutes wear high heeled boots
My prostitutes wear three piece suits
Count your money nigga

[Butch Cassidy - Chorus]
Pimp the system cause the game is grossing
Everyone listen to what we're proposing
Quit the quickness, we'll trick the system
Skills that will impress'em and make this slaves victims
Oh no no no
No more hesitation cause our game is stronger
Taking over
On top of the world they'll never take us under

[Mack 10]
Bitch I'm a pimp
Mack daddy looking for the dollar
And that thirteen I drove a 6-4 impala
Gangsta
Young motherfucker full of izm always dicking
I don't kiss them, twsting, pimping the system
So vp's and presidents wherever you are
Just cut a fucking check and I can bring you a star
Then read up on the deal, make them throw in the car
I got a young lawyer bitch she just passed the bar
See I'm a pure rare pimp, but I told them I got
Young homie pussy don't pay you like EMI
Mack find the ho
Then sign the ho
Then put the bitch out and steady grind the ho
Hit the radio jack and then just like that
Bitch bring money back when the ass on the track
A pro watch them come
And I watch them go
And if you don't pimp the system
Then you's a ho, whoa

[Chorus]

[WC]
Bitch better have my money nigga I'm starv-o
I'm hard on the game like I'm hard on the cold
I treat rap like a trick
Nigga the tag on the bitch
Wrap through you rich
King Kong
The can of the bitch
State your order
Wipe them off and put them on a corner
And if she good
I take her on tour bring me ebona
I'm a rider, gangsta, wall spray painter
True banger, got nam-e, taking out enemies with my fingers
Now feds and undies when the gummy thristy homies
Looking funny I converted the street like the rap money
And now is all about the benjis and with this pen
Like pussy I pimp this lyrics like pimping cane
Leaning in my cadillac
Buffing on a De la Hoya checking ? for neighboors and high power lawyers
Cause i don't trust a bitch
I'm trying to stay way rich
Break the bitch nigga
Break this bitch
Pimp the system

[Chorus]

[Ice cube]
My nigga Mack said
Pimp stands for put it in my pocket
So that's what i'm gonna do
While ya'll thinking about bitches in corners
I'm thinking about the beach and coronas
You know what I'm saying

[Chorus]</pre>
