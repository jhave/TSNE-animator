Easy easy easy come easy go
I don't want you no more
Cuz I been diggin, done dug myself a new hoe
Got me a HOT mamma mia, mamma mia
Got me a hot mamma mia, mamma mia
Got me a hot mamma mia, mamma mia
got me a me a me a HOT HOT mamamamam

You see that girl with the Gucci on
We be d-doin it on and on and on

That's my new boo, packin all that body
Caliente hottie is all I got to say
She call me her black star, nigga rico suave
Love her like a porn star every single day
but She be actin innocent like she ain't into sex
any other way then Missionary position
and but yo-

You see that girl with the Gucci on
We been d-doin it on and on

Uh huh uh huh I'm her new nigga now
Bank account bigger but that don't mean a thing- cuz
My new boo love the way I dig her out
Plus she got a job, makin figures like me, but
We ain't really into that, spendin cash eatin at fancy little restraurants
M'erfuck a restaurant, cuz
We dine in, sip on wine an get tipsonic an' do sex slow like

JB "Uh Oh!"

Easy come easy go,
I don't want you no more
Cuz I been diggin, done dug myself a new hoe
Got me a HOT mamma mia, mamma mia
Got me a HOT mamma mia, mamma mia
Got me a hot mamma mia, mamma mia
got me a me a me a HOT HOT mamamamam

You see that girl with the Gucci on
We been d-doin it on and on and on

That's my new boo, and I be her negero
She be packin body is all I gota say
She be lookin hotter than them girls in the videos
You can holler at her but there ain't no way
She gon' pay you any mind, give you seconds of her time
If you look close, you can see my DICK on her mind! so,

If You see a girl with the Gucci on
We be d-doin it on and on and on

On an on and on and on, on and on
Lovely lovin til the til the break break 'a dawn
Do it do it til we til we see the see the sun
Six in the morning and we ain't ain't done!

Baby we gon' keep it goin
Cuz we both don't gotta work in the morning

So we'll sleep in
til like three in
the afternoon, wake up, and do sex slow like

JB "Uh Oh!"
Doin it Doin it doin it and doin it
We do it, we do it
do it do it d'do it do it

Easy come easy go,
I don't want you no more
Cuz I been diggin, done dug myself a new hoe
Got me a HOT mamma mia, mamma mia
Got me a hot mamma mia, mamma mia
Got me a hot mamma mia, mamma mia
got me a me a me a hot hot mamamamam

You see that girl with the Gucci on
We be d-doin it on and on and on</pre>
