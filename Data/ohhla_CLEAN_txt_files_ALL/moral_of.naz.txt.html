[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo I'ma tell y'all a fable or prayers that'll upgrade and emancipate you
I listen to echoes and laughter to complete this final chapter
Reminisce on animation through a hospital patient
I know the world was tainted, but walk is so is the fainted
This pressured me into an existence of bearing hatred
Seeing you in the Clark Asian Basin had my heart aching
Like Lason cocaining already deadly medication
I'm standing by your side my tear duck stay up open wide
'Cause people try to flaunt, a mirage when you die
I denied your presence could disappear within a few minutes
Sat and stare at the flat line, the machine's beep continuing
You never knew how much I cared, never knew my life I woulda spared
We had an argument, a departed math, shoulda been scared
I kept thinking to myself
If I only apologized you wouldn't have left that night
Maybe you would still be alive
Having an easy feeling the night as I stared in the ceiling
After three hours of sleep started kneeling and prayed
Seconds later God brought me Angels in the form of Police Brigade
Banging in my domain, I knew soon as they said their name
"Open the door" "Shit, oh my God, what's happening"
(Kevlaar 7: "I'm sorry your girlfriend has been hurt in drunk driving accident")
Everything black and I'm walking to the car straight numb
Not admitting to myself that I'm losing someone
Waited for hours in the Hospital, this is gotta be impossible
Turned out the drunk driver only had his license revoked
I choked at the conclusion that me and you
But I was right there hoping you knew
When you passed out I was right beside you
And it be true when I saw you hauled off in the Hurst
I wanted to find a pet cemetery and dig you from the Earth
Took some time off work to deal with the stress of your death
Now all I got left is home videos when you was in health
Recorded your laugh and putted on this track so now I listen to that
And realize we shouldn't departed while in our heart's anger sat
I'll never do that again to appreciate everything I have
Even when I need it's your head stone that I grab
And bring flowers apologizing to you years after you pass
The ugly face of this world is a hard thing to mass
Word!

(Outro) Bronze w/ Rap samples
The moral of the story: is never leave no one when anger lies between
Stay true, know what I mean?
(Poetic of the Gravediggaz: "I saw the woman I love colored in blood")
For all those in streets say "Peace" ("The Lord he taketh away")
(Poetic of the Gravediggaz: "I saw the woman I love colored in blood")
We out! ("The Lord he taketh away")
(Poetic of the Gravediggaz: "I saw the woman I love colored in blood")
("The Lord he taketh away")
The Unknown, got this shit
("The Lord he taketh away")
(Poetic of the Gravediggaz: "I saw the woman I love colored in blood")
Hold your heads, alright! ("The Lord he taketh away")
(Poetic of the Gravediggaz: "I saw the woman I love colored in blood")
("The Lord he taketh away")
