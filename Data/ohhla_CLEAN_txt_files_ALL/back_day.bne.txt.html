(Bizzy Bone)
Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day
Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day

(Layzie Bone)
Yeah, I remember back in the days
When we was "Creepin on ah Come Up", we was tryin'a get paid
Before a nigga really came of age
We was walkin with a trench on, totin that gauge
High tech boots on, blue khaki suits on
Bailin through the snow, tryin'a serve them rocks
Got a "Pocket Full of Stones" like UGK
Little dudes gettin money up on the block
Runnin from the cop car, never really got far
'Cept for the time when they tried to knock sparks out-
-My aaasssssss
Got me thinkin to myself, how long will it last?
Movin so quick, shit, livin through the hit-list
East '99, we was young, black, gifted
Bone Thugs niggas, didn't want none niggas
Cause they already knew how them Thug boys kicked it
Pistols sick, when we was drunk and high
Little bitty niggas that loved to fight
If somethin went down, didn't rub me right
Still to this day, somebody gon' die
Bullets gon' fly, my word is my honor
'Round my way, you gotta walk the walk
On some real talk, have ya outlined in chalk
All I gotta say is, it ain't my fault
Can't be bought, takin no loss
Still to this day, I'm the bill collector
Come wrong to the Bone, and I gots to check ya
Automatic weapon is my selection
Don't need protection, we'll fuck you up
Big Buck is my nigga, don't press ya luck
And y'all still ain't ready to fuck with us
Cause in thugs we trust, and we mean it!

(Hook, Layzie Bone) [Bizzy Bone]
Booone, Booone, Bone, Bone 
[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]
B-O-N-E, we got it goin ooooonnnnnn, ooonnn, onn, Booone
[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]
B-O-N-E, we got it goin ooooonnnnnn, ooonnn, onn, Booone
[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]
B-O-N-E, we got it goin ooooonnnnnn, ooonnn, onn, Booone
[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]
B-O-N-E, we got it goin ooonnn

(Verse 2, Bizzy Bone)
Outta my mind, akin the way I think, to the main-frame of game
Bang-bang, gotta get down for my thang
Shame game, stuck in ruts, ready to fuck?
Put a simple sepena, but give 'em thumbs up
Seven is a sample, but a sign of the time
Fly fast, give me whip up in a cup
And a dime, and a bag, and a swisher for my nigga
In the middle with the Henny, with the heifer with the bald head, long hair
Some here, it's all here, all, yeah
Man I'ma call here, call here, it's all here, walk here,
Run here, gone with the wind, and never comin again, then shiiit
Give it on up, give it away
Kids, listen to the words I say
Pray like everyday, is the only way
I can focus through the pocus and the games people play
Run to put the "Money in a Zip-Lock Bag"
Up and away, better move yo ass
Too many jokes I smoke
Too many smokes, I know
Too many loc's that I passed, my past
Cocked in the set, like Aftermath
Slim shades, lemonade, and a nice squeezed breast
Balls, look at the close calls
I told ya dog, because I know ya, dog
Even when I know you're wrong
And I told the world, all about that hatred
Look at your small profits, they hate little Bizzy
And you know I'm gonna make it, just better watch that sissy
Slowly homie, cold and phony, ascended, splended, spend it shawty
Slowly, I'm more Holy and homie, and Jesus knows

(Hook, Layzie Bone) [Bizzy Bone]
Booone, Booone, Bone, Bone 
[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]
B-O-N-E, we got it goin ooooonnnnnn, ooonnn, onn, Booone
[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]
B-O-N-E, we got it goin ooooonnnnnn, ooonnn, onn, Booone
[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]
B-O-N-E, we got it goin ooooonnnnnn, ooonnn, onn, Booone
[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]
B-O-N-E, we got it goin ooonnn

(Verse 3, Layzie Bone)
How many more times have I got to tell ya?
I'm all about success, don't fuck with failures
Niggas is jealous, and too overzealous
Don't come in my face and don't talk to my fellas
We hellous, rebelious, and definately straight
Sound like we come from a Heavenly place
These are the breaks, better make no mistakes
cause little Lay ain't got no time to waste
I'ma face the truth, and I'ma raise the roof
Cause this shit here is mine
I done been around the block about a thousand times
And I done been around the world at least a couple times
My rhymes double times, I hit 'em with the rhythm
When we hit 'em with the rhythm, like we hit 'em way back in the days
Y'all niggas gon' pay, y'all niggas gon' pay
You can hear the Bone song, or the R n' B
Just listen to the radio, y'all will see
Anything go down that's regarding me
I'ma tell 'em off the rip what this chargin be
Or the target be, point it straight to ya dome
I'm tellin you know, just acknowledge the Bone
I'm sittin at home, and I'm polishin chrome
Ready to bring it onnn
I handle my business, can I get a witness?
Niggas is wantin to be me
Not Mike, but little Stevie
I'm the one that's makin it look so easy
Eazy-E, tell me can you feel me?
The best there is, the best there was
The best there ever will be, you'll see

(Hook, Layzie Bone) [Bizzy Bone]
Booone, Booone, Bone, Bone 
[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]
B-O-N-E, we got it goin ooooonnnnnn, ooonnn, onn, Booone
[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]
B-O-N-E, we got it goin ooooonnnnnn, ooonnn, onn, Booone
[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]
B-O-N-E, we got it goin ooooonnnnnn, ooonnn, onn, Booone
[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]
B-O-N-E, we got it goin ooonnn

(Outro, Bizzy Bone)
Church nigga, church!
