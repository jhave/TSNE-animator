Verse 1: Bobby

I'm paranoid of loiZOID
We fight like Guiver against the hyperZOID NOIDS
HIGH ACHIEVER mind computes like a THIEVER
Thoguhts connect like the quarterback to the wide receiver
Stay blunted drinking cokey nine hundred
Never fronting on my niggas on the battle zone
Thoughts flip before they change your whips on the
good ship Jesus before Kimet was called Egypt
Before the bloods and crypts tomahawks and pimps
Eighteen pumas spazed we still had balds and braids
Amplify the sound of the earth rotation
Who could pin-point the exact location in space
It's to see hear and feel the earth rotation
That's why knowledge is the basic foundation of
all days and creation, like man is the foundation of
his family and the sun's the foundation of the solar system
Wisdom is the manifestation when words and actions are put
into activation escape this captivation niggas busting
wasting shots like masturbation transforming like gobots
They created a race of robots our new rulers are 
computers Abbott's been known now come through to us
Heads drifting in space like asteroids,
Pass the roids, savages trading places like Dan Akyroid
The truth is ignored, these devils must be destroyed

Chorus: Bobby

Search for the better things in life
Beef wid wife make a nigga live a street life
We smoke blunts, throw weight, pay rent

Verse 2: Baretta Nine

Yo, check it out, yo, one two, yo
Soon to smooth litigating
Camouflage educating
Baretta Nines barating
Only smoke rounds a day and
Ain't nothing to overdo the shit
Ya'll niggas best to come up quick
We gonna start and finish it 
Cause I'm sure watch me murder it
Undersiege fatigue get bat at major league
Nine industry forms that be forced from catigues
We live righteous TC they go up do the same
Fuck the fame we hear the bill better keep your 
eyes peeled fuck around get killed it ain't safe no
fucking more C-Ciphers at my door and I got more
than one war, I'm gonna stay on my toes and do the one
to two timers, we gon' make this year our year to
beware peace to rhymers our life is in a bond-a
Sware we gotta find a, way out we took the crypt ride
we all about, on these streets trying to make ends meet
Stay on my feet gotta eat God you things is deep peep
the sleep, How you see camouflage these cats 
We on that bullshit, last days thinkings of snakes
and either pull it soft you know like an afro
other cats sit like Castro I murder that snitch ass
Donnie Brasco, We dissatisfied of your devils
running running high, my mind and my physical be unified
To the day we testify we wanna be penalised 
Form God Allah motherfuckers best recognise 

Chorus: RZA

A bag of dast mixed wid stress
Search for the better things in life
Beef wit wife make a nigga wanna live a street life
We smoke blunts, duck Jakes, pay rent, stay bent,
Attend wakes, baby make
Search for better things in life,
Beef wit wife, make a nigga wanna live a street life

(Sing first 4 lines of first verse)
