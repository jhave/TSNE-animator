[Verse 1: Gwen Stefani]
I heard that you were talking shit
And you didn't think that I would hear it
People hear you talking like that
Gettin' everybody fired up
So I'm ready to attack, gonna lead the pack
Gonna get a touchdown, gonna take you out
That's right, put your pom-poms
Gettin' everybody fired up

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 2)
[Diamonique]
Get
One on them whips, youse a hater, talkin shit
Didn't wanna say shine right from the get-go
But I'm lovin every minute of it, bitch
Say My Name, Say My Name like Destiny's Child (Whoa!)
How you like the way I taste in your mouth
Diamonique's blowin up like No Doubt
Yeah, I know you can't stand it
Wanna Boom Bap with the Queen Of The West
Well, let's handle it

[Gwen Stefani]
So that's right, dude, meet me at the bleachers
No principals, no student, teachers
Both of us wanna be the winner
But there can only be one
So I'm gonna back, gonna give it my all
Gonna make you fall, gonna sock it to you
That's right, I'm the last man standin'
Another one bites the dust

[Rap Verse 2: Diamonique]
Didn't think I'd ever make it this far, hun
In the streets, I'm a certified rap star
Now you mad, cause I won't holla back
Did you really think I wasn't gonna play you like that
You got the game all twisted like
Thinkin I was a celebrity over night
I been doin this, got it on lock now
There can only be one me, and I'm hot now
