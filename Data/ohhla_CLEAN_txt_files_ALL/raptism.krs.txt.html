Artist: KRS-One f/ Hezekiah Walker Choir
Album:  The Sneak Attack
Song:   The Raptism
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

* H.W.C. harmonizes a melody (no words) where this appears

So gather round now for the raptism
Cause if the dogs don't get 'em
the cattle get 'em, or the gat'll get 'em, or the crack'll get 'em
Time for spiritual activism, life is a journey
and Kris got the map with him
Teach latinos and blacks with 'em
It's amazing when whites and asians kick raps with 'em
Cause out of a thousand MC's, believe I taught half of 'em
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, I beam through many images
My origin is a mystery like capstones on pyramids
We live it kid, challenge the teacher you will regret that
I'm giving careers and taking careers away, did you forget that?
* Better check that, you can rock this track and the next track
* But when I correct the spirit hit, you'll always be set back
So gather round now for the raptism
Only those that got hip-hop in 'em
and not rap in 'em and no crack with 'em
Step up now and receive a holy dose
from a holy host, and take a break from these rappers that only boast
*
{HWC} Wake up, to make up
[KRS] Yeah yeah, yeah
{HWC} Wake up, to make up
[KRS] Huh, huh, yeah yeah, yeah
{HWC} Wake up, to make up
[KRS] Yo, yeah, yo..
* My intellectual battle will make your brains rattle
* I'll unwrap you and your crew from the same shackle
I'm on many different planes like a airport
Psychologically you be rethinkin your identity and cuttin ya hair short
Now there's a thought, that exposes your insecurity
You put no fear in me, I break the M from the C
* And reverse it to say "See 'em? See 'em?"
* They allow the devil to lead 'em, and they be givin up they freedom
So, huh, gather round for the raptism
{HWC} Wake up
When the spirit hear it the lyric long before the track get 'em
{HWC} Wake up
I spit 'em out, gotta get 'em out, the world I never been about
I see them glitter but their spirit's goin in and out
We see them fading, we also see them hating
We also see those living for musical chart ratings
Hear what I'm stating or trading for what you're paying
Replace fear with faith and you'll stop decaying
Gather round for the raptism (word)
Gather round for the raptism (word, word)
{HWC} Wake up, wake up, wake up
* Gather round for the raptism
{HWC} Make up, make up, make up
* Cause if the dogs don't get 'em
* the cattle get 'em, or the gat'll get 'em, or the crack'll get 'em
Yo, yo, gather round for the raptism
{HWC} Wake up
Word.. word..
{HWC} Wake up
Word..
{HWC} Wake up
the dogs don't get 'em
the cattle get 'em, or the crack'll get 'em, or the gat'll get 'em
{HWC} Wake up
{HWC} Everyday, when you wake up
{HWC} You got a chance, to MAKE UP!
Remember, you are not just doing hip-hop, you ARE hip-hop
{HWC} Wake up to make up
{HWC} Wake up to make up
Twice a year, hip-hoppers come together
to celebrate the unity of hip-hop
We come together, during Hip-Hop Appreciation Week
{HWC} Wake up to make up..
Which is every third week in May
{HWC} Wake up to make up..
Then, we come together in Novemeber
to celebrate Hip-Hop History Month
I will see you there - PEACE!</pre>
