(Get down)	--&gt; James Brown

New jacks, yeah, but never sleepin
Just stressin the mind and constantly keepin
You on the go, so let the knowledge flow
Where I find a friend, you have a foe
Think that we're crazy cause we like havin fun
Make it minorities but never simpletons
Don't hear us on the radio, but please understand
They don't want me talkin knowledge cause I'm a blackman
You ( ? ) and cant, rage and rant
And all they keep sayin is the music's violent
And what I'm sayin makes many of them sick of me
Matters in the least, I raise my hands in victory
One is a fist, the other is a peace sign
So let the beat run as I express the mind

7's for the stars, A is for Allah
The 3 is for us for we are the scholars
Rockin your body till your mind's content
I know you love it because it's evident
On and on and on and on
Product of the new school, for the old was strong
Runnin the risk, makin a wish - never
Because we're clever the name lives on forever
Makin history, yes, every minute
Creatin the future cause we're livin in it
Enjoy yourself, yet by all means
Hold up a fist: red, black and green
Yes, the two are blackmen, we are performers
Say you don't dance, tonight you're gonna
Cause I incarcerate you for the crime
Let the beat run as I express the rhyme

Yo, The 7A3 expressin all feelings, all charisma
through our rhymes, youknowmsayin?
cause we expressin anything that's in our mind

( ? 2 lines in Spanish ? )
Habla pochito Español
But makin you dance is what I'm here for
Don't have to make love to make you conceive
Watch the movements of the body and you say 'I believe'
Masters, at whatever we do
Commit a crime yo, but never leavin a clue
Young men, all wise, all seein
Talk to the people but never deceivin
Only one land that we call mother
Don't know what it is, look at the cover
As we move ya, groove ya and improve ya
Your girl is feelin horny? Well, we can soothe her
Make her jump for joy, so start to rejoice
We are the three, we keep the panties moist
Yo, I'm steppin outta here cause I'm out of time
So let the beat run - cause I've expressed the mind</pre>
