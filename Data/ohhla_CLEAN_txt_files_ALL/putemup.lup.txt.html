[Lupe Fiasco]
Put one in the air like the king's son
For the heir to the kingdom
That means I'mma be the king once the king done
If he don't wanna leave then I might have to guillotine him
I sing some but I rap a lot like the king's son
Microphone checker all across the board you should king him
+Diamond+ mine my mind make princesses like +King+ +Come+
Every second worth of thinking
Is enough to fill three rings like Ringling's
That's how I kept it on the air is like a re-run
And kept the kings comin in obscene sums
You see for me it's life or death like a king thumb
Mean something
That's why I don't play when I relay like a team run
And treat every single day like a scene one
Outlook on life like I ain't never seen none

[Chorus]
I keep my back to the past tell it bye (bye)
Face to the future tell it hi (hi)
Everything is super so is fly (fly)
Come and stick the fans up
Go on and get your hands up high
High
High
High

[Lupe Fiasco]
Post coast to coast gotta dose of every lingo
The latest famous 80's baby like the dingo
Who evaded pushing daisies, dodge bullets like Remo
Remember like Ginkgo when we used to play bingo
Used to be in awe with the pushers and the pimps oh
Now I flip cars like the ribs on the Flintstones
Haters got mad and as sensitive as shinbones
Had a Goodyear and my intention is to blimp on
Even if I'm injured I'm gonna limp into the end zone
From game one to the super like Karrine dome
That mean I went to Disney World and you just went home
It's Lupe and I ain't from there
But they root for the away
Yeah they stunned there
Beautifully I play
Gatorade the coach and tubas need to play now
Usually I stay, put em on the roof with more truth for me to say

[Chorus]

[Lupe Fiasco]
The laboratory happy for me cause I'm back with my belongings
Ferrari 'bout as red as when Carrie was the prom queen
Think outside the box like Larry Merchant, Don King
The glacier in Jamaica or a penguin out in Palm Springs
Yeah, keep em in the air like a swan wing
And Im'a keep it magic as a Harry Potter wand swing
And my little shop with my terracotta pot
You be talkin bout your kush, you should come and here my 'larm sing
So put them up like a robbery
A Derrick Rose lob to me
And watch and see I alley-oop it properly
Football or volley-b, hock-el-y, or sock-el-y
You just get the rock to me
Try and put me down like Gaddafi over Lockerbie
I'll lock you in a locker b
Like Bruce Leeroy, like Johnny in a locker see
Shock is the only thing that Tupac is toppin me
Hot as rocket bottoms or kill 'em where your lava be

[Chorus]</pre>
