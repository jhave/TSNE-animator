[Intro - Skyzoo - talking]
Shorty, I invite you
To get rid of that JetBlue dude
And jump on this G4 lifestyle
Get with the new, come on

[Chorus - Skyzoo] (Carlitta Durand)
(Fly away with you)
I could make it easy to fly
I could make it easy to fly
If you ain't scared of the sky
Baby, I could make it easy to fly, ya know
(Fly away with you)
Yeah, (you). yeah, (you), yeah, (you)
If you ain't scared of the sky
Baby, I could make it easy to fly, ya know
(Fly away with you)

Fly with me baby

[Verse 1 - Skyzoo]
Huh, higher than you ever been (ever been)
By a landslide baby, this a better win (better win)
And I can't lie baby, if I'm never in (never in)
I call it a day and we can start propellerin (woo!)
I'm talkin seven day weekends, same weather seasons
Pullin up in front of your crib like "how you need it?" (yeah)
Let you stretch out like you should
See I knew that you could
All you needed was a reason for good
And you can call me your reason, call me your favorite
Call me when you're through with your past and I'll erase it
And I know that you used to your past but shorty face it
You deserve different and me, I work different, so ride with me
Get high with me, is how it's supposed to be, when you rollin with G's
Let me Birkin your bag, Giuseppe your Nikes
And G4 you for the rest of your life, get it?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Skyzoo]
Look, look, when your phone rings and his name shows
Baby you supposed to be excited to say "hello"
So if your phone rings and your mood drops
Then all that means is you should make a move ma
'Cause see you could be bad dolo, what you got him at home fo'?
Let go of the baggage, what is you holdin on fo'?
Why run in place when you could just run away?
Meet me at the peek of your dreams and come and stay
Hope aboard the private, think of me as the pilot
Point where you wanna go and we can get to ridin
Mile high clubbin it, I can get to providin
And we can get to twistin the sheets like "where the time went?" (woo!)
They say life is what you make it, right?
so if he makin it dark, what ya days is like?
See if he makin it dark, you should break the night
Get ya passport and take this flight, fly with me

[Chorus]

[Break - Skyzoo] (Carlitta Durand) - 2X
Baby we could fly, so sky high
That you could look down on your past like "bye, bye" (bye. bye)
You could look down on your man like "bye, bye" (bye, bye)
Look at 'em and say it's a wrap - "bye, bye" (bye, bye)

[Verse 3 - Skyzoo]
Uh, we so better now (yeah), we so whatever now (yeah)
Meanin whatever you want, we go and get it now (yeah)
We so in tune with the new in you now
And so used to the climax that you lose count (woo!)
You good so far, that wasn't so hard
Told you fill up your Goyard
And not look back
And you did it, now how real is that?
Huh? Yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro - Skyzoo - talking]
Yeah, yeah
Come and G4 your lifestyle baby
I mean it's the better thing to do, ya know
It's the righteous way to go
Haha, yeah
