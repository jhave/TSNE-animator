"You see this motherfucker!" {*echoes*} 
 
[Frank Ocean] 
Blessings, blessings, yeah 
I see 
 
[Chorus: Frank Ocean] 
Elephant tusks on the boar of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast 
Mercedes in a row, winding down the road 
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo, before the Basquiat show 
And if so - well fuck it, fuck it 
Because this water drowned my family, this water mixed my blood 
This water tells my story, this water knows it all 
Go ahead and spill some champaaaaagne, in the water 
Go ahead and watch the sun blaaaaaze, on the waves, of the ocean 
 
[Jay-Z] 
Uh, dope boy still smellin like cocaina 
White boat, white robe, can he be more cleaner? 
The oil spill that BP ain't clean up 
I'm anti, uh, Santa Maria 
Only Christopher we acknowledge is Wallace 
I don't even like Washingtons in my pocket 
Black card go hard when I'm shoppin 
Boat docked in front of Hermis pickin cotton 
Silk and fleeces, lay on my Jesus 
Oh my God, I hope y'all don't get see/sea sick 
See me in shit you never saw 
If it wasn't for these pictures they wouldn't see me at all 
Aww, whole world's in awe 
I crash through glass ceilings, I break through closed doors 
I'm on the ocean, I'm in heaven 
Yachtin, +Ocean 11+ 
 
[Chorus] w/ ad libs 
 
[Jay-Z] 
Me and Ty Ty is like Pablo and Popeye 
Windin dirt roads on mopeds spillin Opus 
Welcome to the magnum opus 
The "Magna Carta", the best-sellin author Decoded 
Yeah, on the +Holiday+ playin "Strange Fruit" 
If I'ma make it to a +Billi'+ I can't take the same route/root 
Swoosh - that's the sound of the border 
Swoosh - no that's the sound of a baller 
Muhammed Hovi, my back against the rope 
The black Maybach, I'm back inside the boat 
Shepard Fairey, they finally gave me some +HOPE+ 
Can't believe they got a nigga to vote 
Democrat, nope, I sold dope 
In trouble waters had to learn how to float 
On the ocean, I'm in heaven 
Yachtin, +Ocean 11+ 
 
[Chorus] w/ ad libs</pre>
