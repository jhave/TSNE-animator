"Cali, Cali" - Notorious B.I.G.

[Intro - scratched by Statik Selektah]
"Cali, Cali" {*4X*}

[Kali]
Aiyyo one's for the money, two's for the hoes
From the two-one-ohs to the seven-one-fo's
I, come from the place where the kush gets grown
So, every single day I, stay gettin blown
And, I'm more ahead of them, somethin like a veteran
I catch 'em in they spot, "Late Night" like Letterman
I'm so sick and I don't think there is no medicine
I'm better than, all of the whack rappers you creditin
So STOP~! Please don't approach me with dumb talk
My brain can't breathe, I let off like a gun spark
I love where I'm from, I love where I'm at
I'm so killer California I am off of the map and
If they knock that it's, off with they hat
Like a 747 that reach heaven and back but
I won't slow down, nah not now
So switch up your frown and smile when I'm around

[Chorus]
When they see me in the club, all the ladies give me love
They run up and give me hugs because I'm "Cali, Cali"
When I'm on the East coast, in my big fur coat
Somehow I still think about "Cali, Cali"
Shit, what can I say about the place where I stay?
It doesn't rain one day in "Cali, Cali"
I got my six-four raised and my Eazy-E shades
It's just another day in "Cali, Cali"

[Kali]
Turn your ears up! I'm spittin but never written
Statik told me Kali you're up like Great Britain
My flow's off the meat rack, hot like a heat pack
My swag's like turbulence, it'll knock your seat back
1985 I was comin out the hive
Straight buzzin like a bee 'bout to sting you in the eye
See there's somethin 'bout me, that makes me different than you
And that's the fact that I'm determined, I know what I wanna do
So I'm dangerous, anything I'm on turns stainless
Stuntin like we're famous, but how could you blame us?
You walkin like a tourist, I'm walkin like I made it
Hold up! Somebody tell 'em what my name is
"Cali, Cali" I'm a one man army
Spittin like I gave it sin, y'all minotaury
My flows automatic, I'm a monster I'm a savage
We +Mobb Deep+, me and Stat's like Prodigy and Havoc

[Chorus]
