Song:   Take What You Take
Typed by: ÇexyÇy

A picture paints a thousand words
As one door closes, another door opens
And two wrongs don't make a right
Now good things come to those who wait
Take the highs with the lows dear
You'll get what your given and everything's gonna be alright

What the fuck do you know?
Just 'cause you're old you think your wise
But who the hell are you though?
I didn't even ask for your advice
You wanna keep your mouth shut
You wanna take your thoughts elsewhere
'Cause you're doing in my nut
And do you think I care?

Say what you say
Do what you do
Feel what you feel
As long as it's real
I said take what you take
And give what you give
Just be what you want
Just as long as it's real

Now by a horse, I once was told
That all that glitters is not gold
And all that is to fear is fear itself
This horsey also told me
I should keep my friends close but keep my enemies closer
So as to protect myself

What the fuck do you know?
Just 'cause you're old you think your wise
But who the hell are you though?
I didn't even ask for your advice
You wanna keep your mouth shut
You wanna take your thoughts elsewhere
'Cause you're doing in my nut
And do you think I care?

Say what you say
Do what you do
Feel what you feel
As long as it's real
I said take what you take
And give what you give
Just be what you want
Just as long as it's real

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Say what you say
Do what you do
Feel what you feel
As long as it's real
I said take what you take
And give what you give
Just be what you want
Just as long as it's real

Say what you say
Do what you do
Feel what you feel
As long as it's real
I said take what you take
And give what you give
Just be what you want
Just as long as it's real

Say what you say
Do what you do
Feel what you feel
As long as it's real
I said take what you take
And give what you give
Just be what you want
Just as long as it's real

Say what you say
Do what you do
Feel what you feel
As long as it's real
I said take what you take
And give what you give
Just be what you want
Just as long as it's real</pre>
