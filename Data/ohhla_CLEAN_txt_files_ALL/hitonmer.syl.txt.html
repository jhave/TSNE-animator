[Mos Def]
It's me and you, tribulations and trials
Situations is wild
Love, drama, stress
Love, drama, stress
Love, drama, stress
The Voice

[Syleena Johnson]
Just because I'm in love with you
Doesn't mean I'm gon' lose my life for you
I wanna be free from all this misery
Cuz you treated me so hatefully
You give me rain when my sun shines
You bring me pain when pleasure's mine
But I'm breakin' free cuz this ain't for me
Don't want me kids to see how you hit on me

[Both]
SJ: Why'd you hit on me?
MD: Baby I won't do it no more
SJ: You said that, you said that
    You said that, you said that before
MD: Baby girl don't want you cryin no more
    I realize I was wrong
SJ: Why'd you hit on me?
MD: Baby I won't do it no more
SJ: You said that, you said that
    You said that, you said that before
MD: Don't turn your back on me
SJ: Please, you raised your hand to me

[Mos Def]
Now, now wait a minute while I explain
I'll never do again those silly things
But you can't keep testin me, disrespectin me
You talkin to me sideways
Only a man can say so much
(SJ: But I'm your woman) Now baby just trust
I'm a do right by you and my sho is too
(SJ: Then show some respect and treat us as such)

[Both]
SJ: Why'd you hit on me?
MD: Baby I won't do it no more
SJ: You said that, you said that
    You said that, you said that before
MD: Baby it's like my mind in a storm
    I realized it was wrong
SJ: Why'd you hit on me?
MD: Baby I won't do it no more
SJ: You said that, you said that
    You said that, you said that before
MD: Don't turn your back on me
SJ: Please, you raised your hand to me

[Syleena Johnson]
And I ain't gonna take it no more
No matter how much you say you still ain't showin no love
Didn't your mama tell you not to hit a woman?
You know you wouldn't step to me if I was a man
And everyday I try to do right by y'all
Holdin down three kids, two jobs, and your beggin in-laws
Thinkin days would get better as I grew stronger
And now that I'm smarter I don't want you no longer

[Hook]
SJ: Why'd you hit on me?
MD: Baby I won't do it no more
SJ: You said that, you said that

    I realize I was wrong
SJ: Why'd you hit on me?
MD: Baby I won't do it no more

    You said that, you said that before
MD: Don't turn your back on me
SJ: Please, you raised your hand to me

Now baby girl it's no defense but our exchanges get so intense
And you get flyin, don't hold your neck, start holdin your hip
Then I get (Brooklyn, Brooklyn), go and flip, lost my cool
Bout to cold lose a jewel
Yeah of course I wronged
Cuz I don't wanna come to ?more rat home?
And I know you holdin down my gates
And hookin up my plates but you ain't gotta be all up in my face
I ain't a perfect man, I'm a workin man
But you be treatin me like Dante ain't worth a damn
But you don't understand my love and how concerned I am
Let's talk, more action ma, let's work this plan
Furthermore, you never know my hurt no more
But 'fore we work each other's curves some more
Let's hit that bedroom and work it off
Let me improve on the man I am
Sweet Syleena give me one more chance
That's your plans
