[Intro]
She say you be stuntin bitch that's everyday
She wanna chill with Sosa but not everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
She wanna chill with Sosa but not everyday

[Verse 1]
I be smokin dope shit, that's everyday
3hunna swole, bitch we be up in the place
Don't care what you say, shit that's everyday
Sosa always with this nigga shit, that's everyday
Can't compare eye, cause I'm hot as fuck
I'm buying foreign cars and some tonka trucks
No snitchin' but we'll line you up
Shoot them bullets, ain't nobody hot as us
I'm a leo but my fuckin' birthday everyday
Hope I be at the awards fuckin' Mary Kate
I'm a leo but my fuckin' birthday everyday
Hope I be at the awards fuckin' Mary Kate

[Chorus]
She say you be stuntin, bitch that's everyday
All my money, go of dope, shit that's everyday
She wanna' chill with' Sosa, but not everyday
Fuck on any nigga bitch, shit that's everyday
Everyday, Everyday, Everyday, Everyday
Everyday, Everyday, She wanna' chill with' Sosa, but not everyday

[Verse 2]
OTF, bitch I rep that shit like everyday
GBE, bitch I rep that shit like everyday
If you think it's chicken then it's bombs away
Ringin' down yo' block, make you run away
Man I get so high I can't pronounciate
Run up in yo' house where your money safe
We be makin' moves, shit that's everyday
I don't stack money, I spend it in everyway
Damn, all this money on my landline
Up all day, bitch we don't sleep we vampires
40 on my hip, click-clack then fire
We don't do this everyday, you's a damn liar

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
She wanna' chill with' Sosa, but not everyday</pre>
