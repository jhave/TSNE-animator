[Quint Black]
Sixteen hoes, sixteen cars
Sixteen stars, rappin over sixteen bars
You ain't never seen big rocks before
Sabotage the show make 'em change the flow
Cash don't make it, put it on hold
Stand back and watch the bitch go gold
(Candy paint, sittin on low)
Headlights shine, blowing for a hoe
You ain't never seen a freak hop to this
Rock to this, make your nuts fucking wanna pop to this
Too much to dream, tons of cream
Fucking in the limo, listenin my demo
Glisten by the pound 
Some smoke weed, some don't fuck around
But check it out, make you freak it when they all alone
The type freak that'll stick you when her momma home
Nigga huh?

Chorus:

Where the bitches and the hoes at?
At the studio
Thats where we make our fuckin money at
At the studio
Thats where the benz and the lex at
At the studio
Plus the cash and the rolex
Its at the studio
Where the bitches and the hoes at?
At the studio
Thats where we make our fuckin money at
At the studio
Thats where the benz and the lex at
At the studio
Plus the cash and the rolex
Its at the studio

[Quint Black]
Chillin, bangin, taking it slow
Short's at the door with some bad ass hoes
Bad Ass banks just around the way
Do it the Oakland way, with a G of Bombay
Whole mic room fuckin filled with smoke
Let Jeff have the gun so he watched the do'
Pushing D-88's, never no trippin
Move out the way and let Pit do the mixin
Keep it all smooth, no jackers and haters aloud
One freaky bitch turn the whole fuckin party out
Infatuated by the cheese
Had a group of hoes yellin out "Black please"
Gee, I'm in the mood for a good time
Every nickel and dime
Dike bitch in the corner tryin to take mine
Hustlin and scheming, puttin it down
Them hoes can't rap still hangin around
