[Snoop]
I get up early in the mourning and begin my mission
Brush my teeth then I creeps to the kitchen
Cook some bacon and eggs and put some braids in my head
Stash this pound, put the shit down then I head
To the spot thats hot, fuck a fed
I gotta clock this knot ya heard what I said
Im taking penitentiary  chances, dancin with the devil
Im in it to win it for No Limit nigga next level
A whole lot of y'all niggas out there walk around dead here take this 
shovel 
Dig your own grave, your pushin on them pebbles
Stand out there on that corner long enough and watch what happen
Quit yappin about what you aint got and get crackin now thats what

Now look at all the shit I been through and I'm 'fen to
Get what I gotta get cause I'm just stright down for this shit

[Chorus] x4

They say money is the key to end all your woes
Thats probably why I love it and cant stand them hoes
I chop trees with G's and take trips over seas
And pack a nine all the time and thats for all my enimies
What y'all thought, I cant get cought
It aint my mothfucking fault they call mister seasonig salt
I'm bringing Gangsta shit to this No Limit click
I'm way down south in a house and I'm bangin this shit
I got gold around my neck that will never ever fade
Rolex watch on my wrist nigga getting paid
Thats all I live fo , you dig it
Game is to be sold not to be told thats what my nigga P said can you 
feel it

While your bitch jocking me and clocking this doe
Boy that sound like the old Snoop Dogg, shit I'm trying to get paid
Papered up and trying to ball y'all feel me

And the fake ass snake ass niggas which is you nigga fuck you
