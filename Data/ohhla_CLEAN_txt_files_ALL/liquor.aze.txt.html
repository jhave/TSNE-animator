[Azealia Banks]
Look, niggaz really wanna beat they chests, for B-A-N-K-S
These niggaz be gorillas for the pin-k flesh
These niggaz be vanilla, the chips be legitimate
They just want the pumpernickel sis in the linens with 'em
So since you vanilla men spend
Can my hot fudge bitches get with your vanilla friends
Hey, I'm the liquorice bitch
You know I'm looking for these niggaz if these niggaz is rich
I make hits motherfucker
Do you jiggle your dick when your bitch pop singing on the liquorice hit, ya know

[Chorus]
Can I catch your eye, sir
Can I be what you like, yeah
I could be the right girl
Tell me if you like your lady in my-my color
Can I be your type, yeah
I could set you right, whoa
How are you tonight, sir
I'm living my life, ooh
Hope you feel alright, yeah

[Azealia Banks]
Hey, I'm the Liquorice bitch
You know I'm looking for these niggaz if these niggaz is rich
You got creme for your colors and a blue eye too
Hi, I wanna get the number to your 212 line
Maybe we could slumber, we could w-w-w-wine
Why I don't do yay, but if you want to, fine
Your fantasy could get that pitch black
Cause it's gon' erupt when ya slip in betwixt that black snatch
Ya like blizzack-ker-black-cat, ema-nem-manating
Where ya mizzat-mustache at
Huh, I bet ya been extra gassed
Bet you really wanna touch up on the molasses ass
Bet you really wanna tongue up on her kizzat today
Cause her kizzat sh-shaved
You wanna cuddle with ya bitch after, eh
But I gotta dip I gotta get at the cake
Lotta scrilla to make, and the dick don't fuck up any scrillac for Banks
No issues picking money over ha-ha, ya beige in her
She just wanna see the best in Greece with some gentlemen and check these beats in the sun
He just wanna see the wet-wet weave when I'm swimming in the West Indies
Then I sit up and catch these breeze
Sip a little bit of Rum &amp; Ting, nigga

[Chorus]

[Azealia Banks]
These bitches know that I be on that black girl shit
That black girl pin-up with that black girl dip
Put that black girl spin up on ya whack girl tip
Ain't official till it been up in that black girl kit
Pick out ya mans and attack real quick, I'ma hit him with that venom and that rap girl hip
I slip out the denims, know that black girl fit, get that Remy in a did and hit that black girl switch
Bitches better tan for the summer, and for the haters, quit that chit chat, and get ya paper
Quote the cinnamon
The cherry-melange bitch verbatim
When I speak about your face in the clam with the flavors
You get that
And stimulate her
Take a lick up on my genital, then sit to savor
Do ya man's and his licorice interest a favor

[Chorus]</pre>
