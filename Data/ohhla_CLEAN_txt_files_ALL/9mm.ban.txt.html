Konvict Music, Akon and David Banner
If niggaz wanna ride tonight, best believe we bout to ride tonight yeah

[Lil Wayne Shouting]
Young Money  Cash Money

[Chorus: Akon - 2X]
I got a nine millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gone make me reveal it ay

[Lil Wayne]
Tool on deck  why would I lie?
Nigga you a pussy  hope ya got nine lives
I can hit a nigga with the nine, nine times
Country ass boy  country like LeAnn Rimes
Mississippi D-Banner and Lil' Weezyana
Errbody got tools so you will need a hammer
I'm a pill popping animal  Syrup sippin' nigga
I'm so high you couldn't reach me with a fucking antenna
You fucking with this man, you can be this man's dinner
The nine gimme brains but the AK add liver
The rapper is insane flowing like a mad river
Make your ass quiver like you naked at winter
Hollygrove honcho  hard time giver
I'm a shark in the water, you just Long John Silver
I got a girl, you wanna meet her?
Her name is nine millimeter

[Chorus: Akon - 2X]
I got a nine millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gone make me reveal it ay

[David Banner]
If I got nine slugs, nine bullets gone fly
If I got a red beam, nine people gone die
Nine mamas gone cry, nine spirits in the sky
Nine preachers preaching nine sermons, telling nine lies
Cause each and every one of ya'll nine niggaz wasn't shit
I would have rather kept the nine rugers in the ruger clip
The index finger slipped, the nine let nine spit
I lick em all like eighteen tits on nine chicks
I'ma suicide risk, nine slits on each wrist
If I die nine times the next go-arounds a bitch
And if I come back, I'll throw 99 shows
And shove nine inches of dick in 99 hoes

[Chorus: Akon - 2X]
I got a nine millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gone make me reveal it ay

[Snoop Dogg]
I'ma west coast original  black John Wayne
Nigga where we from we like to pop that thang (bang)
You better stop that man, fat mouth to dogg and I'ma pop-pop-bang
Pigs wanna bust me, hoes wanna suck me
Niggaz wanna touch me - None of that, trust me
I'm too slick, too sly, never snitch, I let it ride
I set aside all my feelings when I'm killing like a villain
Move quick like a cheetah  I'ma killa
I ain't here to lock up  I flash the heater
Then lock your whole block up
Dip-dop-deeter Banner turn the beat up
Illa-fo-reala my nilla dilla never caught
You niggaz always acting hard
I keep a nine millimeter in my waist and got two more in the car
Yeah your all about to get it so quit it
Tryin' to conceal, you'll fuck around and make me reveal it
So killas kill it

[Chorus: Akon - 2X]
I got a nine millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gone make me reveal it ay</pre>
