[Scarface]
I woke up to a tune on the radio, check it
An old church hymn behind a breakbeat record (yeahhh)
Sounded kinda funky so I pumped it, right
but rudely interrupted by a neighborhood street fight
When will you motherfuckers quit?
Every motherfuckin mornin it's the same ol bullshit
I peeped to see the thrashin
Some nigga runnin with a butcher knife, screamin out "Assassin!"
He ran by a friend of mine, it bugged him
His eyes showed fear, that's the reason why he stuck him
Anyway, that's how I seen it
You rarely see a nigga kill another nigga,
and he doesn't mean it
So that's the way I took it
Anyway the boy is dead, no matter how you look at it
And life goes on..
I was feelin kinda funny - aiyyo something's wrong
I went to take a shower Duke
Bumped into the wall and I smooth went through
Now I'm thinkin I'm in trouble
I reached to touch my face, but I couldn't feel my beard stubble
I screamed, "Oh Lord help!"
Looked into the mirror and I couldn't see myself
I called up my mom's house
and realized somethin was wrong, no doubt
She picked up, said "Hello" in a low tone
I said, "Hey ma!" and she hung up the telephone
Sick and lookin weary
My cousin walks in, I said, "What's up?" but he didn't hear me
Started packin up my shit G
Looked at a picture of me, put it down and said, "Rest in peace"
Realizin what he said man
I can't talk, I don't exist, I'm a dead man
Yeah I guess I'm dead right?
I'm goin to the cemetary to peep out Action's gravesite
And sure enough, there it is
My mom and girl talkin, holdin on to Brad's kids
I look into the box G
Son of a bitch!  I don't believe it, that's me!
Momma kissed me on my head
Aww shit.. I'm dead (I'm dead)</pre>
