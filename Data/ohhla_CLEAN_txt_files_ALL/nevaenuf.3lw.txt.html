[Verse: Lil Wayne]
3L and Wayne, what up
Listen, I'm way better than that chump
Sorry 'cause I let her get her stuff
'Cause she shiftin' with a brother who could never get enough of her
I'd go tough for her, could never do enough for her
Mad love for her, mad thoughts of her
Days and days again
And I'm like Rocky, where's my Adrianne
Now holler back
Sweethearts bounce if you feel me
Little women love, little me never get enough

[Verse: 3LW]
Why every time I meet a guy who wants to try
To get my mathematics I deny
He wants to take me home, he's out of his mind
Will I ever meet someone for me

[Hook: 3LW]
He's gotta be the one
That I'm daydreaming to spend my time with
He's gotta be the one
With no chicks attached and that's my man

[Chorus: 3LW]
To all my girls that dream know what I'm talkin' 'bout
The ones that makes us cling to the thoughts of love
He's so fresh, he's so clean, yes, I call and he calls me too
That's why he's bad, my place, his pad, I could never get enough

[Verse: 3LW]
I, I'm so glad I came across this kind of guy
He didn't ask me for my number, I thought why
Then when I got the chance and now he's gentle inside
Now he's the one that's got me open wide

[Hook: 3LW]
He's gotta be the one
That I'm daydreaming to spend my time with
He's gotta be the one
With no chicks attached and that's my man

[Chorus: 3LW]
To all my girls that dream know what I'm talkin' 'bout
The ones that makes us cling to the thoughts of love
He's so fresh, he's so clean, yes, I call and he calls me too
That's why he's bad, my place, his pad, I could never get enough

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Mom, I stop to holler, not to bother
If you busy I'll wait out for hours
I'mma stick my wait out all the way out for hours
What you know 'bout bein' hot for hours and not from showers, shh...
Not yet though, how 'bout some flowers
How 'bout we hop the wild one, knock out some lobster
I could make your problems easy , stop jabbin' and slabbin'
Weezy never get enough

[Chorus: 3LW]
To all my girls that dream know what I'm talkin' 'bout
The ones that makes us cling to the thoughts of love
He's so fresh, he's so clean, yes, I call and he calls me too
That's why he's bad, my place, his pad, I could never get enough

[Chorus: 3LW]
To all my girls that dream know what I'm talkin' 'bout
The ones that makes us cling to the thoughts of love
He's so fresh, he's so clean, when I call him he calls me too
That's why he's bad, my place, his pad, I could never get enough</pre>
