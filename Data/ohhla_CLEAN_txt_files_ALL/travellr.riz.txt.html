Last week, I was passenger on a car seat
Thinking of decision that I made within a heart beat!
She used to make my heartbeat but usually alarms me my lungs are over
Working and I (cant breathe)
Yes I convinced myself I don't like relationship malarkey
And she's says wait, you didn't ask me... (How I felt!)
I said I love that your a (nice girl), and I'm sorry
But this really Wasn't time well
And it kinda feels like it may be a blur
Maybe coffee and telly is what I mainly prefer
Feel I gotta scratch the surface gotta break it to learn
And now I multiply the times in which the tables have turned!

I call this the traveller's Chant!
Whether you sitting on a train or in the back of a car
Thinking, Maybe it's me, Yes I do have places to be; and I'll be there
Do I start at the end or do I end at the start
And in this little bit of time will I get very far?
Maybe it's me? Yes I do have places to be!
And I'll be there!
Yes, yeah the other day I was sitting on the train but in another place
I was on my way home, or maybe some would say
I was thinking bout the days I wanna run away
I've only really gotta couple mates, Me, myself and I, How CLICHE
Looking out the window, feels like I'm in a film
Director producer and as it happens I'm the main (character)
Yeah my own little feature, length sound track being
What ever's in my speakers (Then)
I'd rather not be held accountable I bank on peoples feelings
It's no wonder why I'm feeling spent, yeah and in a deeper sense
Sometimes I need the rain it helps me kinda clean my head
The suns an easy friend, I'm thinking maybe the duration of my journey
Helped me reconnect my feelings then!

I call this the traveller's Chant!
Whether you sitting on a train or in the back of a car
Thinking, Maybe it's me, Yes I do have places to be;
Do I start at the end or do I end at the start
In this little bit of time will I get very far?
Maybe it's me? Yes I do have places to be!
And I'll be there!

(Oooaah oooah woaaah) [Repeated]

Oh yeah... Yeah, I'll be there, I got places to be and yes!
(I'll be there!) Yeah, Uh, Yeah, I'll be there... Said I'll be there
(And I'll be there!)
