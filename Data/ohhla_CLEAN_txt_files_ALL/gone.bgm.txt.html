        Push, push, push, push...
        Here it comes...
        It's - it's a girl

{Big Mike:}
1971 a young girl gave birth
Only a child, bringin another child on this earth
Only 15 years of age
But comin from the ghetto, it won't make the front page
See, that's the way shit go
And to the government she ain't nothin but another hoe
Thinkin all she want is food stamps
Give her a check and let her hang with the school tramps
And mama's gettin mad
Cause now she gotta watch her little girl grow up fast
Straight ghetto life, straight ghetto drama
Wanted a baby doll, now she's somebody's mama
And life is so confusin to her
Askin herself why is this happenin to her
So now she gotta choose
Between a box of Pampers and a pair of new tennis shoes
Never had to make that choice before
Never heard a baby's voice before
And the daddy ain't nowhere to be found
Too busy bein a hoe around town
He just fall into another statistic
Claimin black men don't do shit
But that's the way it is
And little do they know daddy also sheds tears
Cause he don't know what to do
Be a father to his child, or run with a crew
You might say: easy choice, be a father
But why should he do it when his father didn't bother?
Just another sample, I guess
Of black men settin bad examples
Thinkin deep about the whole thing
Takes his last bit of money and goes to buy a gold ring
And askes her to marry her
Promise to get a job, so he can carry her
Thinkin that's the way to do it
But little do they know that there's much more to it
Cos marriage is demandin
It takes lots of patience and understandin
But they go and tie the knot anyway
And they'll be gettin their own crib anyday
The first couple of months were alright
A new crib, adaptin to a new life
But then came the arguments
And the constant fightin got em thrown out their appartment
So now they gotta move in with her moms
And that just adds to the muthafuckin problems
Cause now he's feelin like he failed
And while they asleep he grabs his shit and bails
Smooth out the do', black
And never takes another look back
Now grandma's house is an unhappy home
Now that daddy's gone

{Scarface:}
Daddy broke before I stepped in this muthafucka
And left the job to be done by my mother's mother
Raised up by grandmother ???
Cause my mark-ass daddy never came around for guidance
So now I'm forced to stand up on my own two
Cause mommy dear had to work three jobs, duke
He didn't even want my friendship
I guess the mark-ass nigga wasn't down to begin with
Too lit to come around with his drunk ass
And beatin up my mom with his punk ass
And shit got dread
I guess I shouldn't talk so bad about my dad
So here it is, brothers
If you gon' have babies, you need to father them muthafuckas
Cause if you don't in due time
Your kids'll speak about daddy exactly like I do mine
So do yourself a favor
Take your kids to the park, buy em shit, and they'll pay you later
But payin's not the issue
If you'd die right now your little kids wouldn't even miss you
So put away your caddy
Call your bitch up and tell her to make room for daddy
Cause if you don't you'll be alone
And the only thing they'll say about daddy, is daddy is gone</pre>
