All the money I got I am gonna put it on the side
But you no I am gonna shine

Tall Big knots in the pockets like four socks pulling out more jock
More drops gotta watch for the ?
I am clean yeah you know me a veteran in the hood stand up old G
Low key oh (did I say low key) more keys in than boss in OC
More cheese in the weed in the indes

So cold they might bring Berry to her Knees

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I see shorty see me, so I see if Shorty wanna be with me (holla)

To test her heart, to react on him

And other pair of G Knotts sold in the store plus every pair of Ed Hardy that was made
Plus my Tru shoes, they made for them boyz that be breaking the news
You can fake with your crews, but you make it chose
If your late or your snooze, I am gonna drap you in blues
In my state I am fool
Black on Black Louis knapsack, fresh out the pack
You cant car jack (what)
We strapped in the Lac (what) we never give dap, to the homees who rate
