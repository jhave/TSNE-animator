Verse 1
[Wise Intelligent]
Students listen to the lesson I be teaching. 
Learn by Holy Intellect cuzz it's a blessing. 
Teachers study what is spoken through the speaker.
Weaker preacher there's no need for manifestin'.  
I'm the star soul controlin' all within the solar. 
Poor... So I'm a righteous teacher from the heart.  
Praise your god.  All praises due to Allah.   
Seven star the holy intellect being taught.  
Grab a hold I'm not here to promise any gold. 
Lessons told the story about a trader of that type.  
I tell this mic that I'm not here to feed your fantasy 
cuzz that ain't right.  
I guarantee ya everlasting life...Mentally.  
The holy intellect is infinite.

So I take this into consid' 
call upon the intellect to create what I did. 
Ghetto! Stay strictly ghetto is my motto 
I got em trying to place me as a role model.

Verse 4
[Wise Intelligent]
I work hard gonna slip to fall victim, 
Stick dem which tend not to shine. 
Blind anyone that laughs at my kind.  
Why? Because PRT is holy as the mind. 
Check What one must do to come next.  
Let's show holy intellect. 
Thoughts created from the crescent of the brain cell. 
Fell deep into this mic that  I be holding. 
I told them PRT is always soul controllin' .  
They laugh but listen to the lessons I be born I'm the teacher
Or am I subjected to the negative no.  
It's amazing how my thoughts can be wrote to perform.
[Culture Freedom] 
Pardon may I ask whats going on?
[Wise Intelligent]  
Word is bond the Wise is making knowledge born.  
Now I say yes or should one say 'Y' equals to himself  Y equals self
