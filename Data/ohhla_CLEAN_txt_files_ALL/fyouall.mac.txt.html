Song:   Fuck You All
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Dude, I'm starting to realize it's not my fault
that I can't have a good time when I go out
When I leave the house for that matters. Yo

For the chicks in expensive clothes
Looking for a place to stick their nose, standing there in a bitchy pose
With your arms crossed acting like you're too beautiful
To have a good time... NOBODY LIKES YOU!

To Gregory, the guy of my job
The two-faced snob, that will stab you in the back for a raise
And he starts another workroom on every other day
Man fuck him and say NOBODY LIKES YOU!

And to the frab boys
Racist; rowdy; violent; toxicated; acting real childish
Daybreak drugs, abercrombie, co-add
They get Dave Matthews band-fanshirts NOBODY LIKES YOU!

To the white girls that act like gangsters, and talk like:
"Aww hell no girl, that bitch keep looking at me
I'm a go get my motherfucking shotgun out the trunk"
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah shut up. NOBODY LIKES YOU!

[Chorus: x2]
I'm gonna die but it's not my time
I got a warm ass heart that I cannot find
But the pressure in the world is gonna break my spine
So I gotta let it out right now
Like FUCK YOU ALL!

There's a club in my city called "Blonde"
It's like a freaking nightclub version of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond
You got a fake tan 'til your skin turns bronze
If you wanna get in but uh NOBODY LIKES IT!

Cool man you got a new car
It's got a nice stereo in it. All the windows are tanned
You got leather seats and the rims were expensive
But shut the up about it: NOBODY LIKES IT!

To the guys, that manufacture XTC, thank you
It dehydrates you and fills your head with brain goose
Somebody created techno music on your dumb synthetic drug man
NOBODY LIKES IT!

Every four years the presidenticy could be different
But everybody's lazy and no one wants to listen
There's powers and numbers but people wanna play videogames
'cause man fuck voting. NOBODY LIKES IT!

[Chorus x4]

Ah, club sive
Ey yo yo yo yo
Hey man, complaining that you don't hear good music on the radio and you don't see good music on mtv and shit
It's like complaining that you can't get a good fucking steak at T.G.I. Friday's
Which you can</pre>
