[Verse - Dirtbag]
Call me dirty Dirty, but I shine so clean
Push birdy birdies, now I got a new scene
Me and Timmy T dropping out a limousine
While the girls fix they lipsticks, zipping their blue jeans
We sippin that blue thing, but it feels so good
I shouldn't have another, but I thank I would
My location, conversation, relation that made me hood
The rotation of my records every second made me good
I ain't trying to have relations, Dirt trying to wood
Strong penetration, it hurts when it's good
Should I - choose you or your girl? I choose both
Call Timmy and enforce my nigga, it's time to go

[Chorus]

[Verse - Dirtbag]
O-kay, what we have here me the middle of the club
All my killas in the rear, tec is sealed
I ain't fear, we jump up in the Caddy let's peel
I know you feel excited right beside me baby chill, okay?
You play it right everything be straight
Playa haters get jaw brokes
And I supply slips of bacon drive the block hot, we hate cops!
I'm the Hot Sauce in your Hip-Hop
So 'Up Jumps Tha Boogie' that bang bitch, it don't stop
Hot damn me, y'all can't handle me
I'm the first to drop the hits like DJ Caddy, YEEE!!.

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Dirtbag]
Your hips, your thighs, you make me wanna ride I say
Your hips, your thighs, you make me wanna ride I'm saying
STOMP! and grind, STOMP! and grind, you hear me?!?!
STOMP! and grind, STOMP! and grind, I say
That dank, this drink, it's got me feeling high I say
That dank, this drink, it's got me feeling high I'm saying
Sip baby - sip, sip baby - sip, I'm saying
Sip baby - sip, sip baby - sip

[Verse - Dirtbag]
Uh, Dirtbag my gators'll hurt ya
It don't matter the cost, we purchase
Your girl doing us all my dawg, that's hurting
You're too slow! Believing that ho a virgin
Roll out the carpet, open the curtain
Introducing Dirty, I'm bout to get this thang twurking
I'm bout to shine, I thought you known
Now check on Dirty Timmy new flow, here we go, here we go

[Chorus]</pre>
