My Love..
Come Back...
To Me..

[Verse 1]
I don't know how to describe it
Because I miss you
I wish I would've had the chance to hold you &amp; to kiss you
To keep you in my arms safe &amp; never let you go
I promise little one your momma loved you. (I loved you)
Don't you ever doubt it
I know you're looking down
&amp; I can't wait to see you
When the heavens bring you down
I mean I won't let you go for a second time
My soul couldn't take it
It's like take my heart &amp; break it
I think about you every time I close my eyes
&amp; I hold on to my faith so your memory never dies
I will forever be in debt with you
Because you showed me how to love a way I never knew

[Chorus]
(My Love)
I know you're never coming back
(Come Back)
&amp; My hopes are fading fast
(To Me)
I'm holding on to a feather cause my heart is filled with sorrow
(My Love)
Missing you is killing me
(Come Back)
But you'll always be a part of me
(To Me)
I need to find the strength to hold on til tomorrow

[Verse 2]
See the thing is
I wanna see you again.
I never got over the fact
I just can't play pretend.
&amp; pretend you never happened
when I heard your heart.
God had some other plans for you from the start
&amp; I try to understand but I really can't
I mean I wanted you so bad
What was so wrong with that?
I know I wasn't perfect
I was acting a fool.
I couldn't make a decision of what I thought I knew
Thinking I could live my life pushing God away
Until I got a big reminder when you couldn't stay
Then my eyes really opened
Something had to change.
I wasn't willing to go through something like that again

[Chorus]
(My Love)
I know you're never coming back
(Come Back)
&amp; My hopes are fading fast
(To Me)
I'm holding on to a feather cause my heart is filled with sorrow
(My Love)
Missing you is killing me
(Come Back)
But you'll always be a part of me
(To Me)
I need to find the strength to hold on til tomorrow

[Verse 3]
Wish I would've had the chance
To hold your tiny hands.
&amp; sing you lullabies before I put you to bed.
Wish i could've seen your eyes
Heard your little cries.
Held you to my chest &amp; knew that you were okay
I mean I gotta believe because if not i'll break down
I gotta know that you're in heaven &amp; you're smiling down
Trust that God had his reasons
I was blessed to even have you.
Even for a second i'm so glad that I had you
But that doesn't take the pain away
Even though it's been years I keep on feeling this way
I mean my heart remains broken
They tore my soul apart.
The day they took you from me will forever be hard

[Chorus]
(My Love)
I know you're never coming back
(Come Back)
&amp; My hopes are fading fast
(To Me)
I'm holding on to a feather cause my heart is filled with sorrow
(My Love)
Missing you is killing me
(Come Back)
But you'll always be a part of me
(To Me)
I need to find the strength to hold on til tomorrow</pre>
