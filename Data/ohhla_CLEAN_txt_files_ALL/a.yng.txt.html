Fuck them mutha fuckin niggaz and them hoes 
and them niggaz that be talkin that smack
Act on those pussy muthafuckaz or those hoes'll

Do you really thank that you gonna stop a, top a, drop a, NO
With a nigga in tha street (?) heapin at me, he a true city thug

[D-Roc]
You lay down low for hoes 
Get that mat out your nose
You heard the same story told 
From beginnin to old
I give a fuck no mo', bitch 'bout the cheese
Hangin round a nigga cuz he drinkin and smokin weed
Ridin on them D'z 
Thugs ride clean
Mo' gone mean, 
Just many peepin out that scene, gotta make that money man
So I'm headin to the trap
First hit the Micky D'z, dropped da crib to take a nap
Nigga! Nigga! Nigga!

Chorus: 2x

[China Dog]
You flip the script
I'm gonna kick the shit, for all of my thugs(echo)
Ask me was up, what you got on the dub, but I have no love for scrub(echo)
I gotta get mine, so I grab so Hennessy some weed so I can get crunk
If I get and itchy finger on my finger on da trig- 
I'ma put this nig- in da trunk
Don't waste no time, this killa be kill, I ain't fin to die by this shit
Don't waste no time, just walk up to em, squeeze, and lets get what I need
Drag the body in the creek getta burn rubber cuz I gotta fleed the scene
No time to go to jail for a murder case all the thugs, 
judge you know what I mean (echo)

Chorus: 2x

[D-Roc]
Some of these niggaz be fuckin' ya'll quick, nigga, 
what you taught my Ying Yang Twins (?) still runnin' up at the (?)
Some of these niggaz be perpetratin'
On the side-lines, instigatin
Nigga like me be concetrate, quick to start regulate
Grab yo' shit, ya gon' get killed, times up anyway
Fuckin wit the Ying Yang Twins don't you know the price you pay
Obviously you don't cuz you still wanna run ya mouth
When you hear that A!(echo) we tell em bout that dirty south

Chorus: 2x</pre>
