[Cappadonna]
Yo, You can't keep a good man down
I been through it all, I step on the ground
Even my best friend turned they back
And my label mate brothers wasn't cutting me no slack
Nobody gave a shit they wasn't even checking for Cap
Taking my kindness for weakness, Peep this the weak shit
Stealing my songs putting em out on the sneak tip
Label could never hold me, The Devil can't slave me
I'm thankful for everything that God gave me
I never really want shit but I'm happy I done shit
I hope to keep my life free from the guns and clips
Plus I'm still tryna get Momma out of the bricks
Come on now, Tell me that you praying for me
You should of known, That Christ was staying with me
Win or lose, Adding on to life be the life I choose
I use to sell crack, Now I'm just dropping the jewels
Why is life gotta be so hard, Why the street try to leave me scarred
Why is everybody looking for God
I had to leave Park Hill, I'm a traveling man
I don't stay in one spot that's why I travel the land
Whether I get a deal or not, I'ma still deal with the block
Yall biters try to steal my spot, Duplicate my music
Take my slang, Take cheap shots at me while I'm doing my thang
I'm more close with my seeds, A little older now, I learned to forgive
While yall kicking dirt on Don I'm building a bridge
Treading through the waters, Yall thought I would drown
But you can't keep a good man down</pre>
