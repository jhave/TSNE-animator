[Verse 1 - Freeway]
Uh, who's bad?  I'm bad (that's right)
I am Michael Jackson, Puff Daddy "Bad"
Boy, I will strike you with the belt like your dad (that's right)
I will +Rock Your Bells+, I am LL +Bad+ (Rock Your Bells!)
I am hard as hell
Got the semi on blast, call you on speed dial
You can't confine me to a cell
I injure competition, make the niggaz do the math
They always wind up losin, 'cause I hardly take a L
Take a smell (smell), sniff
I'm the shit like feces, the GT too quick (ain't that right)
You need 200 G's to move this (that's right)
I do this, I breeze past the DT's, so swiftly (swiftly)
Y'all dudes iffy, I'm him, men gotta send other men to get me
And the men that they send, get hit up
I dump the Calico and let off fifty in a jiffy

[Chorus 1 - Freeway] (Bun B)
Is ya gonna ride? (Sho' nuff)
If them niggaz try ya, pull a homicide (sho' nuff)
Empty fifty bullets right in they behind (sho' nuff)
I'm the meanest, toughest, mofo low down around this town
Ain't ya gonna move? (Sho' nuff)
If them niggaz try ya, will ya show and prove? (Sho' nuff)
Run up on them, empty fifty from the tool (sho' nuff)
I'm the meanest, toughest, mofo low down around this town

[Verse 2 - Bun B]
It's Bun Beeder, the heater cocked, show me the spot
I need a knot, whether the bread is for me or not
Leave the block, if I see the guap, I'm on the case
You got the base, I put the glock up to your face
Taste Bun metal, the color of gun metal
When the gun settle, you perish and then Big Bun pedal
Petty drugs, naw, hit 'em with the raw
Head-tie, kill 'em with the no, then we fin' to go (to go)
Split the shit, split the dough, then we hit the do'
Then we hit the blocks with the rocks, let these niggaz know (what?)
Then we fin' to sew up the corners with the blow
If you ain't down, then we hit you with the clip fo' sure (ho)
Let the trigger go, then the nigga go down
Talkin about this yo' town, motherfucker slow down (whoa)
Be easy pimpin, you too squirrelly
Me and Philly Freezy shut it down, early

[Chorus 2 - Bun B]
Ain't ya gonna move? (Sho' nuff)
If them niggaz try ya, will ya show and prove? (Sho' nuff)
Run up on 'em, empty fifty out the tool (sho' nuff)
I'm the meanest, toughest, mofo low down around this town
Ain't ya gonna move? (Sho' nuff)
If them niggaz try ya, will show and prove? (Sho' nuff)
Run up on 'em, empty fifty out the tool (sho' nuff)
I'm the meanest, toughest, mofo low down around this town

[Verse 3 - Freeway]
Nigga wanna war with me, I take 'em on live
I blast the 4-5, you have to pick 'em on up (on up)
He get mangled, I'm bilingual
Abdul Hadi taught me Arabic, I took him on Hajj (on Hajj)
Shaquan, Jazakumullah Hukhair
In the city we residin they warin like the Al-Qaeda
We're never warin, performin like Leonidas
Y'all dudes lazy, you bust a grub and get niggaitis
Put the burner to your gums like gingivitis
Floss with bullets, I'll pull it, crack your eye wear
Hell if I care, I handle business, leave you right here
Niggaz can't afford the lenses I wear
Look at my pair, they are Aviators, y'all are player haters
You can never fly or get a seat in my Lear, you need a high chair
You can try the one but it will get you done
You can go and get your duns, nigga it will get them aired, yeah

[Chorus 1]</pre>
