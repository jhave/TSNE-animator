Intro:  Mista Wells
1-2-3!  In the place to be!
As it is plain to see, we be the MC's!
On the microphone, and I do it swell
I go by the name of Mista Wells!
Standin' next to me, on the M-I-C,
Is my main man, Smile-Lee!
Standin' next to him, he do what he like,
He go by the name of Nephew Mike!
And last but not least, number one in the crew:
He goes by the name of Howard Who!

Verse 1
[Wells]  I know this chick named Tammy, a real fly shortie
         She gets real naughty when she sips on a 40
         And when she gets tipsy, she acts like a stunt
         'Cause a 40 and a blunt, that's all she really wants
[Smile]  I know this freak named Bertha, the town cum-slurper
         I fucked her in the ass till she screamed bloody murder
         And if you see Bertha, tell her I'm gonna hurt her
         'Cause she gave me some shit that my doctor never heard of
[Mike]   I met this honey named Anna at the Copacabana
         Sippin' Tropicana in a calm-like manner
         Just like a hammer, I really tried to slam her
         Man, oh man, she drained my stamina!
[H. Who] I know this dip named Jessica; Bimos used to mess with her
         It really didn't matter, so I still slept with her
         It was all good, in that she gave up the kitty-cat
         And when I was done, I said, "Good lookin' black!"

Verse 2
[Smile]  I met this chick named Nessa, who favors Uncle Fester
         I beat the bitch bloody 'cause she stole from my dresser
         Bruises, knots, and multi-lacerations
         I almost killed the bitch; my lawyer got me probation
[Mike]   I met this girl named Kim at the all-natural gym         
         Tryin' to push up was this guy named Tim
         Who will win, is it me or him?
         Gave her a grin and I was IN!
[H. Who] Check it, I know this dip named Chiniqua, she lives in Masapequa
         Got a body boomin' like a JBL speaker
         I tried to get her, my nephew had hit her
         So instead, I bagged her sister!
[Wells]  I know this honey named Brenda, she lives Down South
         Took her in the alley, put my nuts in her mouth
         And when she got finished, I bent that ass over,
         Pulled up her skirt and proceeded to stroke her!

Verse 3
[Mike]   I know this shortie named Judy with a really big booty
         Got howdy-doody in my jacuzzi
         The shorty got moody and that really didn' suit me
         So now I'm tutti fruitti with her friend named Susie
[Wells]  Now there's Christine, the freak of my dreams
         Who gets real freaky with a can of whipped cream
         Took her to the crib, I had to do it quick
         And when I got finished she was jockin' cool dick!
[Smile]  I met a chick named Irma, no ass firmer
         When it came to suckin' dicks she was a real fast learner
         She packed an automatic, she always had static
         People call her Irma, but I call her Hump-a-matic
[H. Who] I know this dip named Tasha, she worked at Red Lobster
         She wanted to get nice so I bought her some Vodka
         Gave her a joint, went to Huds Point
         Then I drove her wild like AJ Floyd
[Smile]  I know a freak named Lucy, her lips were mad juicy
         She got sent away because she ate a baby's coochie
         She was a real hottie, she acted kinda snotty
         She worked at the mall, but she stole a dead body
[Wells]  There's this honey named Angie with a fat ass-crack
         Killing Me Softly, like Roberta Flack
         But when I saw her sister, it really didn't matter
         So I had to step off, 'cause the booty was FATTER!!</pre>
