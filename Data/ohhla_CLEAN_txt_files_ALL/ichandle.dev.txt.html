Typed by: andreiberezin2010@rambler.ru

Baby... hey girl... Come here... Yeah, sit right here baby
Let me just hold ya... Yeah, let me see your hand
Yeah, come here, let me see ya hand
You feel how hard this dick is?
Let's not let it go to waste

We need to get closer baby
Just like we supposed to, girl
Sometimes I know your "no" means "maybe"
But it seems you wanna leave my world
And I can't handle it
Cause you know that I made you feel real good
When ever you were with me
We used to be so close and so coverly

Can't say how much I love and I miss ya
Wanna hug, I wanna kiss the lips
But you steady treat a nigga like Tisha
Always gone on these weekend trips
And I can't handle it
Cause you know that I made you feel real good
When ever you were with me
You used to be down more than any bitch could be

We oughta try to get it together
Maybe we can't add shit up
We've been thru the stormy weather
If you can't stand it baby that's what's up
But I can't handle it
Cause you know that I made you feel real good
When ever you were with me
We used to keep each other company

The loving that we used to make
I think about it from time to time
I know you prob'ly lookin for something new
Good luck on who you're tryin to find
But I can't handle it
Cause you know that I made you feel so good
When ever you were with me
You used to be down more than any bitch could be

Ohhhhhh...
Yeah baby...
Ohhhhhh...
When ever you were with me
When we had a little privacy</pre>
