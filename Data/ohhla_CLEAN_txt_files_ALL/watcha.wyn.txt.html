What
What?
Nigga, huh?
Huh?
Nigga, what?
What?!
What?
Check!

I'm shootin', flee
Pollutin' you and your niggas, betta run from me
Comin' through in a strap... with a 223
You be losin' your life when you caught up... in beef
What?  Nigga nigga, shiiiit!
Now, I'm ridin', ride
With a K on my side
50 shots flyin', fly
Nigga, you want beef with I?
I hope you lyin', but why?
In the middle of tha night, I be fatigued, camouflagin' by
Byy-bahda-by-by-by
Huh?  Nigga, what?  Takin' me for a joke, and watch me hurt cha
Boys there, they be commercial... I beat 'em 'til they purple
I'm a lil' bitty nigga, but I got a big ole chop, 2's that'll kill 50 niggas
Didja do it?  Thought it was cool?
But cha still in it, nigga
Your so ugly with your boys, but I'm still pretty, nigga
Lil' Wayne representin'
I cut like blades, I bust heads, and break legs
I tear up dreads, take our breads, now go figure
What?  From tha 17th, I back down from no nigga
Had me four deep in four cars on your block with four triggas
Man... ya'll niggas ain't up for this!!
Ya'll hatin' on me, you can suck my dick!
Didn't I tell ya ta chill?
Guerrilla, you can play if you want
Find yourself in tha back-a my trunk
Ho, feminine punk!

(Chorus)
Now, nigga, what?!  Huh?!  (What?!)
Nigga, watcha wanna do?!
Nigga, huh?!  What?!  What?!
Watcha wanna do?!
Nigga, I say what?!  Huh?!  Huh?!
Watcha wanna do?!
Nigga, huh?!  What?!  What?!
Watcha wanna do?!

Now I be Wayne Wayne Wayne... from CMB
50 shots, flame flame flame... from artillery
Bullets, they stain stain stain... burn like rubber on tha streets
(Screech!) If you can't hang, find your way from 'round me
Lil' soldier in all black off-a A.N.E.
I pullin' ego, my nigga, so ain't no playin' me
Yeah, I may be... a lil' small and all that
But I'm 'bout war, totin' a gat, flippin' a car and all that
Now freeze!  Me and my g's hitchyour hood like fleas
Soldier rag, black 'Bauds, white T's, and Ree's
Please, tell me that you was fulla weed
When you said you want beef
'Cause I don't think nonna ya'll famileez wan' see ya'll bleed
I know what tha hell it be
Ya'll niggas don't listen up when we speak
I be ten-deep
Lettin' 223's chop trees
(?) told me not ta be weak, and let a nigga play me
So he... who take tha biggest bite, lose all-a his teeth
Hook up wit Juve, Turk, and B.G.
Open niggas like ki'
G... I bet some g's, boy, can't wet a HB
Or Steve's... CMB's make tha scene off tha heez
All ya'll beef-b's be seized when we ride... g's!

(Chorus)
Nigga, what!  Huh!  What!
Watcha wanna do?!
Nigga, what, nigga, what?!  Nigga, huh?!
Watcha wanna do?!
I say what!  Huh!  What!
Watcha wanna do?!
Nigga, what!  Huh?!
Nigga, watcha wanna do?!


Look, dog... you can be stupid if want, watch, it be war
Or all you drive tha car, I hit tha block and.. cut 'em off
Whole nation gon' fall... when Wayne spins tha cut
Guns up, nigga, what!... I clutch and bust
Niggas duck and hide... when.. I.. ride
I load tha forty-five, and explode on your side
My niggas, Mike and Mario,  they got some 2's for me
And I spin a nigga ben until he use ta me
I'm on a 3000-dollar duck.. on your block, just waitin'
Nonna dem niggas could take me, I was too in-tox-i-cat-ed
But, nigga, if you want war with me, besta be 'bout your issue
Hit your set with.. my nigga with them things ta split cha
Picture a lil' nigga dressed in black... with a big ole gun
In front'chyour house, shootin', 'baahhh!!!'.. hollerin' out, 'Nigga, 
what?!'

Nigga, what!  Huh!  What?!
Watcha wanna do?!
Nigga, what!  Huh!  What?!
Watcha wanna do?!
Nigga, I say huh?!  What?!

Have me in all black, bustin' back at your crew!
Now I say, what!  Huh!  What?!
Watcha wanna do?!
