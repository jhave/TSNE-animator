[Intro]
These niggaz don't know who the fuck they fuckin with man
On the real shit nigga, this is Thugline nigga
And I'm that nigga Mr. Sawed Off Leathaface
And I dedicate this shit to all them motherfuckas who used to be down
Wanna be down, but can't never be down
And that's simple because we ain't fuckin with no punk pussy ass nigga
You know them niggaz that always talk the real shit
But they can never walk the real shit
Listen up this ones for you, for you

[Verse 1: Asu]
Soon as I hear these cheese
I'ma stick you like I took ya picture, Kodak smile
You know that number to dial when in need of work, I proceeds to lurk
Squattin and schemin plottin on demon
And It's a whole lot of semen in this dick
Packin bisquit, once the bisquits is baked
It boils down to the risk us niggaz take
Try Asu and leave ya loable to get floored
And if you ain't fully insured you ain't just asleep, nigga snore
I got somethin it (all things)
You got some Henny nigga pour it (we can all drank)
I done lost somethin I ain't tryin to find and I know it's love
Even though I'm dying inside, nigga is still a thug
The company I keep be wantin me to heat fuck boom
I don't really wanna scorn, how I'm supposed to warn?
My folk once provoked, It's on and not gradually
Casualties is random, and like I tell 'em I dump naturally

[Verse 2: K -Mont]
Ay, yo, ay yo whatever you, saw I seen it
Whatever I say, I mean it
Most of y'all bitch niggaz wasn't thugs until Bone screamed it
Recognize the wisdom fuck that nigga shootin clips
Matter of fact I'm tired of talkin, pull you pistol keep walkin
Catch me on the puly wearin a hoody
Or standin on nigga lines, stressin, conversation about dyin it's Thugline
That niggaz be askin who is he?
It's that nigga from Jerz, motherfucka it's K-Mizzy

[Krayzie]
Them motherfuckin thugs is in the place to be
Fuckin shit up it's T-H-U-G-L-I-N-E
Got niggaz in the club
Killas out for blood
Motherfuckas hit the floor when we lit shit up
Thugline, Thugline, Thugline, Thugline, hope you ready
Thugline, Thugline, Thugline, Thugline, we heated heavy (2x)
Do my thugs run this motherfucka (hell yeah!)
Do my killas run this motherfucka (hell yeah!) (2x)

[Verse 3: Wish]
Nigga, anyway you want
This is Thugline willin and ready to dump
Fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up
I got my Line right here, here
You can step and we can jump it off right here
Fuck y'all niggaz, fuck y'all niggaz
How many niggaz you roll with that you feel is real?
How many niggaz you roll that know you gonna kill, gangsta huh?
Fuckin with the Line It's about time someone took it over
I'ma get mine, can't wait for time cause it's almost over
I got wha'cha want baby
You can step, but best believe you won't play me
If you like that, throw your hands up
I know you like that, throw your hands up

[Verse 4: LaReece]
Chaotic situations got a bitch stressin, holdin the guns
Dumpin on these trick niggaz for funds
Titties bouncin in the lo-lo, creepin real slow
La Femme Nikita with my heater and they don't breathe no more
So trick, hit the floor
It's that boss bitch, Nina Ross bitch, know it cost bitch, floss bitch
Got your sister hostage {girl screaming}
You got my green if not, I lost it
I'm leavin a corpse absence
It seems you don't understand my pockets pitfil
So it's critical that I get the dough right now
All your wants I can't satisfy needs
Can't determine do's and don'ts amplifies my greed to multiply my G's
You want war nigga? I got somethin for niggaz
Quick to bust the fouth-fifth for more figures
Standin on the Frontiline with my fan bam, Thugline
Bloody murder all these haters tryin to take mine

[Verse 5: Krayzie]
Call me the boos fighter, Frontline rider
Leathaface'll catch a case up in this place, we'll show 'em who bout it, bout
it
How the dealer stole and cut it, police won't even touch it
I'm a rich nigga come to my show and bring your bitch wit'cha
Two Thousand niggaz all screamin out loud "fuck the law"
And all y'all niggaz mean muggin me and my niggaz is my car
Partna don't get me started
Y'all niggaz ain't seen me get retarted in that mode I'm harmless
When her bare arms we far from harmless
This is the bomb shit so ring the alarm
Takin over the yard, nigga Thugline's in charge
On guard a new clique, and we got new shit
These niggaz ain't nobody you wanna fool with either, so be cool with it
Then niggaz won't have any problems
357 revolver is all it takes to squash an solve 'em
We all in this business to get paid
But meanwhile, we gotta go fight off the enemies that hate us for these styles
Made us some cheese, now fuck the world
Tell 'em Krayzie said it, will I ever switch?
Get out the thug shit? nigga forget it
I'm real with these niggaz, I chill with these niggaz
I kill for these niggaz, cause these my niggaz...

[Outro]
That's right nigga, just do y'all niggaz know y'all fuckin with
The niggaz that's gone put the raw back in the game
Niggaz that's 100% pure thug-bred, thug nigga
Ya better believe that, roll call for the soldiers on the Frontline for the
Thugline
Roll Call
Asu, where you at? (hey, yo Thug On Da Line)
K-Mont where you at? (nigga, Thug On Da Line)
Wish Bone where you at? (what, Thug On Da Line)
