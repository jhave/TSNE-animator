[Daz]
I ain't got no time for no bitches
I gotta clock my dough clownin'
Hittin' switches in a green 6-4
With the drink in a on deck and the bombest indo
A car full of gas and nowhere to go
I gets a call on the phone - "what's happenin'?"
Pimpin', chillin' with bitches drinking Silver Satin
Is them bitches on deck, on deck to the fullest
Gots that type of game and I'm know just to pull 'em
Now as I stroll and as I pass by
Maxin' with my doggs feelin' dandy and high
Is that looney muthafucka that they call Kurupt
Ballin' out the house with some Gin in his cup

[Kurupt]
Now I found myself blowin' out smoke 
Bombed out looney and locced
Open up them doors let me see some of th hoez
it's Kurupt and I'm liable to fuck three or four
I'm hittin' hoes like I'm hittin' licks
But I don't love that trick bitch
'Cause bitches gettin' niggaz dick sick
I don't pay pay rent, my rent gets paid
I pimp hoes like silky train
On and on it goes
I thought thete muthafuckas knew, but now you know

Chorus:

Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch

[Nate Dogg]
1975 I was just a young pup
tryin' to learn to be a dogg
But in the process steadily gettin' fucked
I met this lil' sexie dame ya'll before I knew
All the rules to the game
It ain't no need to lie
A lil' nigga like me got played, and if she left me
I thought I'd die
Ya'll don't ask, I don't the reason why
Thought she was sent from the heavens above
Ya'll it's just a bad taste of puppy love

Chorus:

Puppy Love
Puppy Love
Puppy love
puppy love

Sometimes I sit and think of how I used to be
Before I got converted to a D-O-double G
I'd like to thank that girl
From way back in the days
Cause if it weren't for you I wouldn't pimp this way
