[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
Hey, how you're doin, it's me
The unforgettable incredible B
-i-z M-a-r-k-i with the e
I got more rhymes than Muhammad Ali
The way I get down you'll say
"Damn, the B-i-z always makes my day"
My style is untangible when you hear
Cause the brother on the mic is most debonnaire
On the DJ tip I'm like savoir-faire
Cause you can probably find me anywhere
I'm the best from the west, I'm the beast from the east
I am old school like a permanent crease
Like Scooby-Doo or a Chuckie doll
You better grab a Snickers cause you gonna be here for a while
For all the new schoolers, relax and chill
As the Diabolical just tell ya the deal

[Chorus]
Come party
With the Biz Markie
And ain't no party
Without Biz Markie

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
Now let me tell you how I started in '92
When I was deejayin in Jersey in Howard Hughes
I did homecomings from UVa to James Madison
I did the Tunnel with Flex and caught L in Patterson
Now I graduated with DJ Love
From ( ? ) Virginia, NC and the Q Club
People looked at me and said, "Why you deejayin?
I like Just a Friend and your rhyme-sayin"
So the transition from rapper to DJ wasn't smooth
But I still pursued cause I had somethin to prove
July 4th and Labor Day in Virginia was hot
Cause Biggie Smalls and Teddy Riley was in the spot
From the relays to all the Greek picnics
And all the football ( ? ) and Atlanta Freakniks
To all the girls in g strings and thongs
If you're with me, just sing along

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Biz Markie]
I got so much on my mind like my name was Chuck D
That when it comes to deejayin I'm a Public Enemy
I rock all colors, races and ages
When the crowds see me go crazy they think I'm outrageous
I rocked Sinbad, Essence and the Grammy's
All Magic Johnson joints, even in Miami
First Fridays from Philly to the Lou
( ? ) and Alex know what I can do
Chicago with Corey, Detroit with D. Archer
New York with Gator, Lenny Smith and Lenny the Barber
I rocked all the joints for Eddie Murphy and ( ? )
Still get down and dirty in Newark, Elizabeth
Rock ( ? ) Orlando
Even go across seas to London and Tokyo
I rocked weddings from Toni Braxton to Boyz II Men's Shawn
And this is what they say on and on

[Chorus]</pre>
