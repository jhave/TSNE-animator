Typed by: deephunk@aol.com

CHORUS:
I gave you fair warning, beware...beware...beware... (2x)
 --Mobb Deep sample--


Yo...what you thought punk, shit was sweet, now you can't sleep
Gotta keep ya eyes open wide and hide ya face from the streets
I'm like the beast with a warrant, far from alarmin'
Gave you fair warnin' now you on the stairs swallin'
I'm callin' out any rapper that I doubt, smack 'em in the mouth
Throw 'em in the yoke, BOOM!, then I knock 'em out
No doubt, Freddie Foxxx files 20-shot auto glock, BLAAOW!
Benny blind Puerto Rock style
Wit' a twist of black in the brow, twist ya cap and I'm out
Sleep wit' the fish-dips for yappin' too loud
What's happenin' now? Niggaz is hard as hell but they Gargamels
Pickin' on the smallest victim gives 'em heart to kill
My squad is real and holds it down the hardest regardless 
Besides of the largest, we polish the floor
with the rawest hardcore artists
Flawless victory you niggaz can't do shit to me
Physically lyrically hypothetically realistically
I'm the epitome of catchin' wreck, catch you when you cash your check
Smash you when you pass then jack you for your fuckin' Lex
Nothin' less than the best if the squad did it
Hard-headed niggaz better beware and fear like God said it

CHORUS (4x)

Ay-yo I warned you, now all niggaz could do is mourn you
I'm born to kill and still thrilled, I put it on you
There's no regrets, remorse, only results and loneliness
Only the strong survivors strive through life as warriors
All of us die, some of us kill, even massacred
Who wanna try?  Punisher will if you ask for it
I'm hazardous for your health and hell's your next stop
For real my shit's cocked the world has just stopped...
(pause)
I'm not the one you should be underestimatin'
Come test your fate an' I guarantee I'll be under investigation
You can't handle the whole, I'll slam you on your skull
Or we can go blow for blow like Evander and Bowe, ya never know
However tho' I still hold the title
When all my rivals the chance to dance who missed the homicidal
Hand on the bible I swear to defend my crown
I've been around since forever and never let it touch the ground
Don't fuck around and catch a rude awakenin'
My crew's basically waitin' patiently for you to move your patrons in
Then we'll surround you, form Desert Storm and pound you
Look around you, Terror Squad's everywhere like Soundview
The Boogie Down do it like nobody, who are we?
The foundation, you're facin' a whole army...

CHORUS (2x)

[Fat Joe]
yeah yeah yeah, whassup now potna??! Know I'm sayin'?  Think this
just some rap shit?   We do this shit for real...Terror Squad nigga!
Fuckin' shoot the place up!  Muthafuckas know the time.  This
muthafuckin' rap game.  Joe Crack, Big Dog Punisher, Full Eclipse crew
What da fuck...WHAT???!

BEWARE...BEWARE...BEWARE...
