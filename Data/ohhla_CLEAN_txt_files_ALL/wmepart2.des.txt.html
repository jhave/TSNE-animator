[Master P]
You're my destiny
You wanna be with me
So holler if ya hear me (Uhhh)

You're my destiny
You wanna be with me
Holler if you hear me (Uhhh)

You're my destiny
You wanna be with me
Holler if ya hear me (Uhhh)

You're my destiny
You wanna be with me
Holler if ya hear me (Uhhh)

[Destiny's Child]
Do you ever wonder when he don't come home 
Who he goes to see
And why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone
Cuz everything he like is with me

If I was in your shoes
I woulda had to let him go
&gt;From the first sign of him tryin' to play
If you want me to stay
Ya gotta let all that go
Oh no, you wanna stick around
And not believe in what you see
And while you're waitin'
Thinkin' everything's gonna be OK
I got him, I got him right here with me
(Holler if you hear me)
Oh, oh

1 - 	Do you ever wonder when he don't come home 
	Who he goes to see
	And why in the middle of the night
	He leaves you alone
	Leaves you alone
	(He's with me)

	Do you ever wonder when he don't come home 
	Who he goes to see
	And why in the middle of the night
	He leaves you alone
	Cuz everything he like is with me

I wanna call you so bad
And tell you he's sick of you, girl
What you put him through
Do you expect to mistreat him
And he still be with you
No no no no no (no no)
That's why he's here with me 
(Holler if you hear me)
I don't care what you say (no no)
You can't play with Destiny 
(Holler if you hear me)

As fas as I know
He's in good hands
So you can stop callin' all around
Sayin' 'Have you seen my man?' (Uhhh)
Ain't no need to fuss and fight
Tryin' to make it right (No)
Certain things ain't meant to be
And that's why, that's why he's right here with me (Uhhh)

[Master P]
Be right here if you 'bout it, 'bout it
Master P and Destiny could get rowdy, rowdy
See, holler here if ya even hear me (Uhhh)
All it takes, a beep to get near me, uh
And mama always told me
I could tell a real girl by the way that she hold me
I live the life of a G
But tonight girl, it's gonna be you and me
We be thugged out, Moet, Champagne, I'm eatin' strawberry 
She's callin' my name, you holler 'P never leave me'
And if you really wanna be with me, hug me and squeeze me
Real killa's like to ride (Uhhh)
So jump in my car and just go front, back, side to side, 
You can press just like a flower
And if you real good, your game all about the gizzal
But never mix business with pleasure
You really want me?
Prove to me that you're down for whatever
Put on your soldier gear, let's ride tonight (Uhh)
Thug love, bubble bath, it ain't No Limit tonight
Girl if you wanna be with me 
(If you wanna be with me)
If you wanna be with me
(If you wanna be with me)
Tell me you wanna be with me 
(Tell me)
If you wanna be with me 
(If you wanna be with me)

Repeat 1 until fade while:

[Master P]
If you wanna be with me
Holler if ya hear me
Holler if ya hear me
Uhhh
Hollar if ya hear me
Holler if ya hear me
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Thug love, soldier love
Master P, Destiny's Child
Holler if you hear me
Girl, feel me</pre>
