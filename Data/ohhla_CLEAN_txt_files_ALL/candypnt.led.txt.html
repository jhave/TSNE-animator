Chorus x2 [Slim Thug]
Candy paint drip look clean then a mug
Ca-Candy paint drip look clean then a mug
Got beat with chrome feet drop 24s on em
Drop 24s on em, put 24s on em

Verse One [Slim Thug]
Slim Thugga
That candy paint shinin', 5th wheel reclinin'
Rollin' on 4s grippin' wood with the diamonds
Yella and white in my mouf, got em blindin'
If you lookin' fo Thugga, 
I'll tell you where to find him
I'm MIA in that MIA, 
Fuckin' with my nigga Khaled and that Cool and Dre
Tryna play it how they play, 24s on the dump
Sittin' high in the sky, lookin low at the pump
Got a trunk full of beat, and a freak in every seat
On my way from freeway to the presidential suite
And b you lookin' weak without chrome feet
And if you ain' got candy then yo ride ain' complete
We 100 cars deep, down on South Beach
And I ain' tryna leave till I got 2 a piece
At least, that's how the south bossput it down
You can find me in ya town, with the cleanest suck around 
With the

[Chorus: x2]
Candy paint drip look clean then a mug

Got beat with chrome feet drop 24s on em

Verse Two [Trina]
Yep
Alot of people said that I would not last
Cuz I'ma Dade County off of 15th ave
You remember Mr. Wonderful, that's my dad
Kept my toes on marble flo's, swimmin' in cash
My mama name 'Nessa, taught me the game
16 ladies rollin with a fly ass chain
Use to ride through the city, in hollywood benz
God blees the dead, I'ma see you again
I was the baddest at the west, I'll take yo man
I sneak him into Strawberry's after pack jam
Or Miami Nights, at Miami nights
We was up all night, till they cut the street lights
But now I been crowned as the queen
M-I-YAYO home of the triple beam, ya' mean
DJ Khaled put it on
Diamond Princess, a star is born
I'm on my grown, yes

[Chorus: x2]
Candy paint drip look clean then a mug
Ca-Candy paint drip look clean then a mug
Got beat with chrome feet drop 24s on em
Drop 24s on em, put 24s on em

Verse Three [Chamillionaire]
Yea, Yea, Yea What up Khaled
Ay, I'm pullin' up in somethin' you should take a picture of
Liftin' up the lambo do's, go and give yo chick a hug
Paint wetter than the suds in ya kitchen cuz
Larger than a dove, and it don't feel like O.J. Simpsons glove
Reincarnate Picaso out of the grave,
And still couldn't compete with the way my ride is sprayed
Rims stayin' on the run like a runaway slave
The top is chop-chop, like a summer day fade
Vallet be slippin' slidin' when they standin' by this caddy
My paint wet(yup) watch it do the trick daddy
Me and E got fly rides, if you want it then get at me
If it fit then I don't want em they suppose to fit barely
I made straight As in spanish Khaled they must have forgot though
(Khaled:How many cars Koopa?) Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Add another cuatro, I got another drop so
I'm buildin' a garage on top of the one i got(oh)
Tell the maker of the Chevy that I'm ridin' silly(silly)
Turn it up, heavy bass'll make it poppa willy
I know my cheese is at stake but I'm not from Philly
Jackers watchin', plottin', so Chamilly went and cop a milly

[Chorus: x2]
Candy paint drip look clean then a mug
Ca-Candy paint drip look clean then a mug
Got beat with chrome feet drop 24s on em
Drop 24s on em, put 24s on em
