[Dr. Dre]
Y'all ready to get dirty?
Do y'all really wanna get X-rated?
Heh, bottoms up

[Mimi]
Just hit me up when you need
Sex, endo and Hennessey
Won't you just put it on me
I just want yo company
(Come on baby) Put it on me
Relax and come chill with me
Kick back I got what you need
Won't you just put it on me

[Dr. Dre]
We back, we mack, stay blunted
Knee pads, yo hoes they wanted
Penthouse two o'clock eleven hundred
It aint no fun if I can't reroute your hoes in this direction
Swerve in the intersection, I'm done she restin
No question, done session
Home wreckin, Doc motherfuckin Dre no guessin
Nothin less than, I mess when I'm sexin
Bang on the block
Even Asian bitches like to bang cock
Draws drop, she bunny hops
On it like a pro, she comes out the clothes

[DJ Quik]
But, uh, she flips the dildos
Whether in the Pumps, Nikes or the steel toes
Dre, you can spot it in the benzos
Squawtin real low, got me drivin real slow, she's a real ho
And even though her parents spent the fat chip
On that private school chip
She graduated, got some thug dick and flipped
No more checkered sweater, vest and plaid skirts
She's out here naked more or less and that hurts
But she's in good hands, cause Suga Free palmin
He sent her to the Sheraton with Thomas
If you need 'em they at 310-629-9755
You hit 'em and they let you know when she's arrived
Oh she okay she just runnin an errand
With this Portuguese dime piece named Karen
Bouncin through the mall, spottin 'em all
A sucker for a dick sucker ready to fall
For a daughter like yours
Got him pattin his pocket and comin out his drawers
Layin his jacket on puddles, openin the doors
All for what?
Because I promised her my name gave her the game and still aint fucked

[Mimi]
Just hit me up when you need
Sex, endo and Hennessey
Won't you just put it on me
I just want yo company 
(Come on baby) Put it on me
Relax and come chill with me
Kick back I got what you need
Won't you just put it on me
(Come on baby) Put it on me
Fuck everybody let's just go
(Come on baby)
We can get drunk, have some fun and blow some smoke
(Come on baby) My spot is close, c'mon lets roll
(Don't trip) I'll keep it on a low, ahh

[DJ Quik]
Now we just kickin back playin on some PS2
Contemplatin the game Dre and me best do
If you feelin froggies then leave when we test you
But I'm guaranteein you bitches leavin three less two
Never mind what that love and hate one pairs do
Y'all just snicker at that hooker when we all pass through
Dr. Dre and DJ Quik will probly outlast you
You're like see-trough pair of boxers nigga yo ass trough

[Dr. Dre]
Bitch, you need some good dick, I got that too
Speed bag the clit, leave it black and blue
Time of yo live, I got that boo
Creep late nights up in hotel rooms
We drank, eat shrooms
Kill something, crank the volume
Fuck in every room
You know your home girl want it, Tag team bitch
Why you being dick greedy? Tag team bitch
When she cums, she drips on mattresses
Bedroom time comes I handle shit
Wifey caught up me nigga
That's yo bitch, that's yo biz
That's show biz, that's how hoes is
With or without kids
Long as you keeping it on a hush she ridin dick
Aint been satisfied much, she's been fakin
That's why she callin me, guess what she's sayin
