Song:   American Me
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Chorus) Planetary 2x
It's the land that I love, God bless America
Puerto Rican heritage, Hip-Hop's the culture
We live life by the code of the street
This is us in the flesh, OS, 'American Me'

[Planetary]
Yo, one nation under God, indivisible 
Have seen the lavish loss, invincible
Trying to find a path that's righteous
Half my life is spent trying to find who Christ - is
I live in a country you can't sit comfy
I dance amongst thieves so one chance amongst me
One life that seeks salvation find my freedom
Wit four lives I'm meeting at home I'm bleeding
So I work 9-to-5 two times a day
Allow my pray building trying to find a way
Trying to find an answer and control my battles
But there's thin line between making money and talent
There's only so much that I can sit hungry and malice
There's only so much rhyme writing 'fore my hand get callous
Now some of my niggas don't understand my hustle (Why?)
But this is real life my nigga, don't step in the puddle
Cuz wit this life here, you might drown in fear
What you know about pounds of tears, drowning beers
America the beautiful, you treat me so cool
It ain't love loss; I just put love a whole now

(Chorus) Planetary 2x

[Crypt the Warchild]
It's now time to uplift my people
Give you a voice of clear thought I wanna give my people
Give you choice, real talk, I wanna give my people
I'ma start the revolution, be the one to lead my people
We gon' do this from Vieques to the South Bronx
North Phills, Southern County, ready when the time comes
All across the globe we ready cuz their time's up
And we been waiting too long to let these .9's bust
They wanna lock us up and throw away the key
They wann box us up and don't say it's me
So In God We Trust and it's the way to be
Because my mind is corrupt from all the slavery
I got issues wit fate, the pistols will wait
The whip that's following me got municipal plate
And I'ma high school dropout but I'm fit to debate
I know my mothafucking rights so put your pistols away
Always got love for a nigga if he busted a cop
Cuz I ain't neva get ova them cuffing my pops
Ten years of my life I inherited pain
It's the 'Point of No Return' cuz it ain't neva the same
That's why I neva take a trip down memory lane
I change the path wit the present, let my legacy reign foreva...

(Chorus) Planetary 2x</pre>
