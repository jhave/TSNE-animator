El Che is comin! Uh
Plug City! Yeah
The Best Kept Secret
Talib Kweli!
Elido, elido
Uh, yeah, yo, uh, come on

They say that there's some things you should never say (never say)
Cause you don't wanna offend and push people away
So we all just pretend like we with it
If you smokin, let me hit it, I admit it, I done did it
I done followed some dudes on some dumb shit until some dumber shit
Until the cops *siren* and they was runnin quick
Son of bitch, supposed to be gangster, holdin a hundred clips
With a ton of bricks up in jail straight runnin shit
But if the people knew the facts about it they would laugh about it
Police searched your car and only got two bags up out it
But how you yap about it, glorify and brag about it
I done thought you'd be so rich you wouldn't have to rap about it
Yesterday is history, tomorrow's a mystery
So all we got is the present and that's a gift to me
Literally, I was on the block, had an epiphany
Stop servin, take your ass home where your kids should be
But some of us...

[Singer]
Never can say goodbye, no, no, n-no, no
Never can say goodbye...

[Talib Kweli]
Niggas acting mannish, outlandish and so again
Before the get-go at the disco they panic, I take advantage
Of the opportunities that I'm handed before they vanish
Yeah your man is so hungry I'm famished, excuse my manners
As I cruise the blue of Atlantic waters within the borders
Of a foreign country standin on corners
Before the money for performance, fed my son and my daughter
Before the gas and running water, no I couldn't afford a
Automobile no, a train or bus ticket, wasn't a one to fly
Look my kids straight in the eye, never can say goodbye
Later played a fly on the wall, side of the halls in the industry
Decided to tour, quite consistently
Tear into the mic every night like a Grizzly Bear
Rippin into a fish, I spit it viciously
These rap niggas is more punk to say it vicious B
All them niggas from Harlem New York, the kids be missin me
The world is my home, but shit I still love New York too
The beat is my therapist, I need someone to talk to
Every city I walk through, they can speak Chinese, English or Spanish
I pull out the cash, they understand it
Any country on this planet, I guarantee got fans of Kweli
I do damage then they hand me her feet
Proceed to flip it, won't get into specifics
The how's, what's, when's and why's
Lets just say I can't say goodbye

[Singer]
Never can say goodbye, no, no, n-no, no
Never can say goodbye...</pre>
