Yes sirree (uhh uhh uhh) no he didn't (uhh-uhh-uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh)
Yeah they did (uhh-uhh-uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh)
(Uhh-uhh-uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh) yeah they did..
(Uhh-uhh-uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh) ..
(Uhh-uhh-uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh, freaky freaky)

Who just stepped off in this game and foresizin them WHITE THANGS
and invited y'all to test me wherever they MIGHT HANG?
Didn't need no Hannibal to see Betty got NICE BRAIN
Now they thankin I'm disturbed, believe me I'm QUITE SANE
See we managed to find them flows somehow it's EASY Y'ALL
Take the hardest Timmy beat massage it and MAKE IT SOFT
Go 'head take it off, I won't tell yo' daddy baby
I always had game but I've been extra savvy lately
You probably saw me at the corners in that candy Dodge Ram
Folks who ain't heard the news say, "Look at Andy, God damn"
That must be renowned fam cause I ain't even got a Dodge
But still that same raggy, quite import in my garage
I swear on every ounce of blood in my mama's veins
that I walk these dogs across this country twice to stop the pain
So I'm handin Tim the leash and when I do I hope you cry
Now tell these sons of bitches get this gate, OPEN WIDE

[Chorus 2X: Bubba Sparxxx]
Here we come so please somebody tell them to get, OPEN WIDE
Got three Bettys and I might go tell them that they OPEN WIDE
Got this thang out on the back country rollin is OPEN WIDE
It's what?  OPEN WIDE!  It's what?  OPEN WIDE, whoa!

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Now shit's, sorta changed, since I strolled, in this thang
Cause I froze, on your brain, like a nose, full of 'caine
Now I, try me a few drugs just to, find me a new buzz
But that, time gave me too much, thank God, I finally grew up
How could, I bring this so raw?  Pack up, sing your shit on law
You mad?  Well then that's yo' loss; that's why, yo' bitch is on toss
Drink up, if you really wanna run, y'all wild like Timmy on the drums
They know, not to get me on the rum
Four-fifth, that is heavy when I'm done
Y'all want me to bust?  Y'all sure y'all want me to bust?
I'm in the zone to bust - goin adjust to the home of the fuss
Am I versatile? Probably the best y'all heard in a while
Have mercy child - don't just shake it twerk it with style
Don't y'all love when I talk? How I sell it the way it was bought
The way I was taught - really I fought this battle for naught
And in conclusion - let me say that I'm on yo' side
To hell with Bubba - now show your pride and OPEN WIDE

[Chorus]

[Sebastian]
I was sippin pro, Remi slow, did enough to breakin the law
Flavors froze, songs I chose 'til I get the crowd involved
So I do shows and I lift clothes and point the mic to y'all
Which pistol, could get yo', eyes away from the bar?
Problem solved, stir and call the food court in the mall
And any chick, that I saw, I got her number and all
Help me y'all, if her closet is too small
for some domino drawers or a piece of her, bra
I would reckon that one of her damn digits is off
I legitamately call and end up with a pizza that's large
So I'm, sick of you broads and you, neighborhood stars
Don't care about your cars like Bubba get out the yard
Listen, damnit Bubba pay attention to my hoes with extension
Got my vogues on suspension, got my pushes in the kitchen
Got my streets, on a mission; got my corners with they trickin
There's no fam in this business - came in too fast (sorry)

[Chorus]</pre>
