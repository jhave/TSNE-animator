Shaolin shadowboxing, and the Wu-Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang, could be dangerous

[60 Second Assassin]
Well, what do you know? Another 6-0, no
Mountain be high, valley is low
River wide enough to stop my flow
You still will get burnt like a city, for sure
Call an apartment, it's a fire in the hole
City slick patrol, how far did he go?
Me shack a shack, wrapped and ready to go
From back off the boat, more shit to toss
So get your puff on right, fasten your thinking caps
It's going down all night
Bust on pipes, pressure's up without a pill in sight
Nothing but a deal and a mic
Ill type, you can't want none of this
First and all respect, God gave you the gift
So don't talk yourself from out of life event
Cuz I do yourself a favor and erase your shit
I packed a vest to get, the 60 Sec, conspicuous, and sick with hits
And this from Phoenix, you get pissed in Vegas
You favorites, have it your way, miss
Elected to finish, most, respecting the switch
Time just keep on --

[Chorus 2X: 60 Second Assassin]
Corners and avenues, it's all hot
60 Second, don't miss your spot
Living ain't easy, the streets is greasy
I fill in time, the streets don't need me

[60 Second Assassin]
I go way back, before history was known
Now ain't damn time to get a beat and then choke
From the written you wrote, all makes decisions and croaks
Rafts and boats, dry snitch, no time to dig a ditch
And throw skeletons and bones in the pits
Rise up, we pride enough, all prize up, rise up
To the King like Tut, the road we travel is rough
I watched the, royal turn to rust
Saw the society turn to guts
Maybelline, our facial cream
Now a day makes faces of queens
Fake city of dream, the truth they be lifes a scheme
They all in they pockets like Christmas of Eves
I put the business on sprees, got the Pippy Longstockings in threes
Only thing even is Steve

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: 60 Second Assassin]
Yeah, there it is
It's just getting rougher as the streets getting tougher
Yeah, 60 Sec, ill type, style is coming from the profilest of the wildest
Generated from the mind, then of the society grin
Everybody, huh, just take the train, better
The inevitable, beyond ever
So, I'm too deadly technical
That's why my scribe then get arise in a time before celestial
No being ever hit your sight
You know my corners and avenues stay hot
Youknowhatimean, I pop off with the mission, get a fruit addition
Of indiction, see and mixed all in the mixing
Eyes is suspending, animation, my face, facing the east
