You're the air that I breathe, you're the sun when it breaks through the clouds
You're all that I need, but I know that you're having some doubts
I'm down on my knees, I'm praying you'll stake this out
I'm begging you please girl, I'm sorry I let you down

I'm broken like a promise, I'm shattered like a dream
I'm broken with all my pieces scattered round for you to see
I'm broken like a record, I sing the same old song
I'm broken like the heart of a man that's run away from love too long
Girl what about you, what about you girl

It's so hard to speak, I can barely look you in the eye
It's so hard to breathe, but I know I ain't afraid to die
Your breath is so sweet, your kisses could get me high
My heart is so weak, but your loving could get me by

I'm broken like a promise, I'm shattered like a dream
I'm broken with all my pieces scattered round for you to see
I'm broken like a record, I sing the same old song
I'm broken like the heart of a man that's run away from love too long
Girl what about you, what about you girl

I'm broken like a promise, I'm shattered like a dream
I'm broken with all my pieces scattered round for you to see
I'm broken like a record, I sing the same old song
I'm broken like the heart of a man that's run away from love too long
Girl what about you, what about you girl
Girl what about you, what about you girl, girl what about you</pre>
