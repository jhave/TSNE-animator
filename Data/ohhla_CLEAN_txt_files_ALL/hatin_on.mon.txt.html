Typed by: AZ Lyrics

What they talkin bout?
Chop I swag it
I'm a coke boy yea
Swerve it
Aye aye aye aye

So what they talkin bout?
So what they talkin bout?
So what they talkin bout?

House cellars, diamond ceiling
We talk a hundred bags, you still gon smell it
Got some hoes with us, they go getters
Tat a coke boy on they head and ball with us
More fellas, I wear 4 letters
Stretching out the work, it was all Venice
Your boy stylin, your brother smiling
Red Ferrari, gotta call about it
Got a bad batch, too much puff around it
My bitch ass fat, you gotta walk around it
Made niggas, 80 figures
Call fresh up out of luck, pay stiggers

Mo fetish, niggas ball jealous
Heard they hatin on a youngin but I don't sweat it
I'll get it, I'll just go and get it
Heard they hatin on a youngin but I don't sweat it

I don't sweat it, so what they talkin bout?
Heard they hatin on a youngin but I don't sweat it
I don't sweat it, so what they talkin bout?
Heard they hatin on a youngin but I don't sweat it

I'm talkin snow mountain when my time off
I'll tell your main bitch get a climb on
I pull wingers, give me 4 minutes
In a stove top whip a full business
Wave flipper, pay strippers
Jack dealer, every sipper
My dough brother, co-pilot
Deep down fresher than 4 stylin
Niggas hatin from the side watchin
Got 40 grand in my side pocket
Just go and get it, your bitch ball hit it
Heard you hatin on a youngin but I don't sweat it

Mo fetish, niggas ball jealous
Heard they hatin on a youngin but I don't sweat it
I don't get it, I'll just go and get it
Heard they hatin on a youngin but I don't sweat it

I don't sweat it, so what they talkin bout?
Heard they hatin on a youngin but I don't sweat it
I don't sweat it, so what they talkin bout?
Heard they hatin on a youngin but I don't sweat it</pre>
