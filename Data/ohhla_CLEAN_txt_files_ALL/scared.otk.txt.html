[T-Mo]
Piece by piece, this puzzle comes together
Sever your ties with the bad guys, let the lies go
If you wanna be a hoe, go 'head and don't be scared
Many a bitch, represents, and is led
Whichever way no I'm not gay
and really don't give a fuck bout what you doin
Long as I pave the way
for my SouthWest GA warriors
To come in packs, to feed, takin what we need
to succeed, you know what we gon' do, on this road
We gon' explode, now are you ready for this territory
Makin our life one big story to tell
Reality amongst the youth, long as, breath is in my body
I got proof, I'm not scared

	If you scared, say you scared

[Gipp]
Who's scared?
In this world I'm Gipp, in second the mutant
The third the Geechee, how many ways can you reach me?
Now most be scully, went from clean to muddy
Polished to shine, the season to rhyme
Been down like brown, like dirt to the ground
Been lookin for love, now I bubble like suds
Others flew sky high, while others were duds
Live high up on the hills, to escape the floods
Situation they change, like faces and names
Went from cool to plain, from lame to flame
Man down or not, man plans or plots
Give a FUCK what you think, we ain't movin out this spot
And I'm out

	If you scared, say you scared

[Andre Benjamin]
Yo, paragraph indent, I make intense sense
Niggaz on that Gil Scott dope (hint hint)
At age fifteen they start smokin Billy Clint'
Now he's twenty-one and wants to know where the time went
Hey hey hey what's the haps?  Well see your time elapsed
Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trapped
Baboon on your back, but what's sad is that crack
was introduced to hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it
Maybe your son tried it, rehab too crowded
You scared, she scared, they scared, I said
they scared they scared to talk about it
bout it bout it bout it bout it bout it * repeats and fades *

	If you scared, say you scared

[Big Boi]
February 1st, 1975's my birthdate
The player the B-O-I, was brought onto this Earth on Thursday
I think see, my cap I twist it back from all the dank
But if you see me on the Ave, you betta believe I tote that shank
So what y'all though bruh?  
I gotta protect my name and what we fought for
Southernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer
No lockjaw, we got that raw shit and all the trimmings
Even though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning
The intro, the Goodie we kinfolk, nigga it's fin to jump off
But now it's time I lay low 
cause I believe the track gon' cut off
Psych, the track is bumpin like pussies on some dykes
So if you scared say you scared cause everybody can die tonight
Cause my heart don't pump no Slushee
You touch my niggaz you touch me
I blow up the micraphone like Marilyn Manson, you can't hush me
Yeah

[Khujo]
Heat'll make anything move
Even Tyson, can get laid down, with this tool
Just cause the name say Goodie, you take us for fools
out they rabbit ass mind, don't give me mine, I go off like mines
blowin suckers to smithereens, we was never folks
If we fell out over this lil' cream
Or let some soft legs come in between our dreams
We live like Kings, and die like fuckin men
I don't care how rough you roll, we can't be shut down
Ain't no openin up shop, we already established
You lap doggin, we boss hoggin
Grown men, don't beg for attention
Keep wishin, high heels clickin
Paper champions, leavin with they feet behind
Zap em for the pumpkin, at twelve
on the bottom bunk, holla at me
Six to the left, last one, can't turn over with dirt on ya
Slain dead, devils, don't have enough to purchase my essence
in da head, missin ounces, zip code, eight miles
Suckas, think I got they package
but they still eatin moo-moo, oink-oink
and fowl-fowl-fowl-fowl.. *repeats*

	The truth hurts, but you can't be scared of it
	So remember that, OutKast, Goodie Mo.B.
	still standin for somethin while y'all fallin for nothin
	Stop dyin over this lil concrete and lil paper
	We get this shit together our power's enormous
	You can deny the lie but you can't deny the truth
	You scared, you scared, say you scared!</pre>
