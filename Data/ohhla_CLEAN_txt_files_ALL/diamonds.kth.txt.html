Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Man it's been quiet in the Bronx since Kate Rich got killed
I heard some kid wearin a mink
fakin like he live in Brooklyn squealed
We gon' need Johnny Cochran man, I'm tellin you
Gotta get everybody out..

[Kool Keith]
Chill at home watchin the Mets
I'ma tell Suge Knight to call Big Kap and Funkmaster Flex
Tony Green is out of jail with a five billion dollar bail
I'ma hire two men with machine guns to do retail
Independent promotion, a couple of people got they legs broken
Record exec found dead, body in Hoboken
Autopsy explainin what parts remainin
New York police department, the F.B.I. 
said this guy wasn't playin
Tape around this punk's mouth, what is he sayin?
Turned the radio up and cut his arms off
and throw him off the top of the Waldorf
Call Fat Kat in prison
Tell him his right hand mand already did that
Ten cars, meet me at the Lincoln Tunnel with stockin cops
We're gonna count to the one-oh, put butter on the bun-oh
Black killed the program director but first let him sniff some blow
See the man with the suit?
Light up the kid with the bomber jacket and Timberland boots
Comin at you like Tupac in "Juice", I'ma get loose

Chorus: Kool Keith (repeat 3X)

We work nine to nine, we never sleep full time..
Diamonds, we bring violence!

[Kool Keith]
Send a coffin up to Billboard with flowers in the lobby
A picture of me with Gene Griffin holdin a hand-grenade
I'ma fax you a copy - and let you know my job ain't sloppy
Extort the industry cause Nicky Barnes is gonna be
in charge of every label's distribution
My street team is gonna be eight men with loaded tecs
Ridin around with Chrysler PT cruisers from a mental institution
Whip mob style, Tone Capone AZ in charge of publicity on the phone
Crazy Joe outside to meet the mixtape DJ's with carbombs
in the parkin zone - purple Cadillac lavender two-tone
A box packed up with a chopped off human head
with a murdered pitbull with a knife in his stomach
Federal Express to your secret home
Sonny D handle the Wherehouse and Tower
Take Coconuts and Sam Goody
and hire David Berkowitz as a receptionist for more power
Extreme impact when Uniter Parcel
bring bazookas and bombs in from Iraq
Close the George Washington Bridge when we attack
Carryin duffle bag sacks
Larry Davis is workin with a thirty-eight magnum
Big stations won't have any problem hearin the wax
(I'll play it!)  With Kingston, Jamaica
Sendin the video to HBO and Cinemax

Chorus

[Kool Keith]
Look at the bottom of your car, now start it
Wire on your doorknob
That's me across the street, wearin a pinstripe suit
with a (???), with black glasses talkin to Grandmaster Flash
Lookin at your black asses
