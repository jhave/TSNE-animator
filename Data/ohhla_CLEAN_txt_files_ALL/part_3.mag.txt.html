  YO KOOL KEITH YOU KNOW WHAT?
What Ced Gee?  Tell me about it
  THEM FUCKERS THOUGHT THEY HAD US MAN
  LET'S PLAY SOMETHIN FRESH
Aight, for the ducks...

Bet, who's the {?} - impeccable sounds
To your ears - you hear verbs and nouns
THAT'S DOMINANT, DESTROYING THE HUMAN BRAIN
INTO PIECES, THAT'S {?} BY THOUGHTS
WITH BACKING THUS, CAUSE WE'RE...

[Kool Keith]
.. of a mystical style, combined with common data
If a sucker can't catch it to me, it doesn't matter
A fact, equivalent to a stupid MC
I'm greater, than the rest of them
I'ma smack every deaf and beat the best of them
'til they die, and I'm tellin no lie
Fly native warrior from the Bronx, Cooley High
As my rhymes get tougher, MC's all suffer
from the consequence, in awe and elegance
Your girl's on my jock and it don't make sense
at all, because we're having a ball
Takin out all suckers, to soften up the troops
Cause you got too many, divide your big group
and get paid... and try to be like me
Not another sucker duck punk toy MC
Cause we're - Ultra (Magnetic)

[Ced Gee]
Ultramagnetic, here to emphasize
That we are wizards, sent to reply to
the fundamental, the skills of fascination
To evolve, questing, alluding
Transmissions, received from lower levels
Becoming, music {?}
We represent, our past tense
of rhymes of course, which make sense
But you claim to me you can't hear it
Because your brain is dumb and you're illiterate
to this article
Combined with rhythm made logical
Expanding your thoughts to read this manual
Study!!  Causing competition to follow us
This massive creation, of {?}, cause we're

{*scratched: "Kool Keith!"*}

[Kool Keith]
Well I'm amazing, more or less fantastic
I'm like steel, the others are plastic
That try, to deny
My eminent, thoughts emphasized
Above the unusual pattern
Rearranged in a rhyme... but sometimes
I don't, and I won't but keeping up the pace
As the bass kicks
At a positive height, excelling
To a higher degree of mathematical
Irrelevant terms, germs just stop
Release the mic... put it on the stand
Step back while I overreact and have a flashback
Breakin down the frame
and take part that you don't use - then abuse it
Throw it up and down, then confuse it
Leave you out of control, your memories
Of the wizard Kool Keith advancing energy
Cause we're

[Ced Gee]
I'm quite intelligent, smart and feasible
I'm the professor, with the high IQ
I've earned, a college degree
of studies, three thousand credits earned
Enter data release, obtained true knowledge
Effective when brought in place, or continous
Above the levels that, for the human brain
I've drained, a militant frame
You're a mechanism, for accumulating thoughts
While pertaining, to make my experiments
I'm analyzing suckers who are dumb
I'm enriched with vitamins son!
And if you mess with me, I'll sure you agree
that you will vastly see, that my velocity
is like a gun, releasing a bullet
... Cause we're
