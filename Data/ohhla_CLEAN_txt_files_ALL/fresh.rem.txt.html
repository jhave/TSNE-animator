[Hook:]
I'm fresh, fresh, fresh
I'm fresh, fresh, fresh
I'm so fresh, fresh, fresh
I stays fresh, fresh, fresh
My hair be fresh
My gear be fresh
Oh yeah, I'm fresh I gots to stay fresh
I'm always fresh and this is couture hip-hop
I'm so fresh its like I'm straight (Yeah) out the zip-lock

[Verse 1]
I'm fresh dressed like a million bucks
Got the Louis Vuitton goggles, Emilio Pucci pumps 
With the, Gucci Bra 36C cup
Both middle fingers up cause I don't give two fucks
And I'm fresh, fresh
Yes don't get mad
Bow-Legged stance crazy
Look at the swagg
Look at the bag
And its official look at the tags
And I ain't gay but goddamn my bitches is bad
And we fresh
You home depressed, you always stressed
You try to get fly but you don't never get fresh
I get compliments like Ma you fresh
And I'm just taking out the garbage damn I ain't even dressed

[Hook]
I'm fresh, fresh, fresh
I'm fresh, fresh, fresh
I'm so fresh, fresh, fresh
I stays fresh, fresh, fresh
My hair be fresh
My gear be fresh
Oh yeah, I'm fresh I gots to stay fresh
I'm always fresh and this is couture hip-hop
I'm so fresh its like I'm straight (Yeah) out the zip-lock

[Verse 2]
I'm back on the scene
Krispy with Kreme
I ain't OutKast but I'm so fresh and so clean
Said I'm back the scene Krispy with Kreme
I ain't have to say it twice but it just sound so mean
Yes I'm the queen
And I stay fresh
And I'm still sexy so I gotta get blessed
Ya socks is fresh
Ya boxers fresh
I'm still using condoms case ya cock ain't fresh yes
Tell the truth, I need no less than the best
Because I like to over do it, I'm extra fresh
And these hoes is stupid, they extra deaf
But you ain't gotta listen or hear me
I know that you can see that...

[Hook]
I'm fresh, fresh, fresh
I'm fresh, fresh, fresh
I'm so fresh, fresh, fresh
I stays fresh, fresh, fresh
My hair be fresh
My gear be fresh
Oh yeah, I'm fresh I gots to stay fresh
I'm always fresh and this is couture hip-hop
I'm so fresh its like I'm straight (Yeah) out the zip-lock

[Verse 3]
And ??? fresh
Petit Peton fresh
With the mean Gino Green hoodie on, I'm fresh
Everyday I get dressed, I pop tags, I'm fresh
Joe Jeans fitting nice on the ass, I'm fresh
In NY, I'm fresh
In the Chi, I'm fresh
In the A, M-i-A, and L.A., I'm fresh
Yes, in Texas I'm the freshest
Shopping reckless,
In case I dirty myself then I got refreshments
I'm fresh
The definition of fresh
On the phone, with my shorty talking to him all fresh
I don't re-do or re-use
I'm fresh
Looking in the rear view like "Oow, I'm fresh"
Yes, I'm so..

[Hook]
I'm fresh, fresh, fresh
I'm fresh, fresh, fresh
I'm so fresh, fresh, fresh
I stays fresh, fresh, fresh
My hair be fresh
My gear be fresh
Oh yeah, I'm fresh I gots to stay fresh
I'm always fresh and this is couture hip-hop
I'm so fresh its like I'm straight (Yeah) out the zip-lock</pre>
