[Intro: Trey Songz] + (50 Cent)
Ay girl, ay girl (ay girl) ay girl
Ay-ay-ay girl, you knooooow
And Dr., Dre girl, Dre girl
(It's 50) And Trigga

[Trey Songz]
Somebody pull the fire alarm, girl where you from?
Cause you got this club on fire
And outside I bet all they smell is smoke, all they smell is smoke
Girl, they tell it's smoke, all they smell is smoke, ooh-whoa!
The way your body roll, I'ma lose control
Cause you got this club on fire
And outside I bet all they smell is smoke, all they smell is smoke
Girl, they tell it's smoke, all they smell is smoke, ooh-whoa!

[50 Cent]
Yeah, uh, c'mon
Pink diamonds, pink sand, beaches Aruba
Blue sapphires on days when she feelin Hoover
She hood, and in the mood, when I'm in the mood
Erotic, so exotic, I'm psychotic about it
I don't want forever, I just wanna taste her love
Sample that product, I bet a nigga tongue go numb
She's a narcotic, that bomb shit burnin, we smokin
My old flame, my Mary Jane, we got a love thang
She ain't jealous, I keep Nina around
In the small of my back case some shit go down
Right under my Hermes, I'm hearin the word is, me
I'm a P-I-M-P
I let Trey hit some then Dre hit some
Then pass it to the homies 'til we all get done
Niggaz can't comprehend what this shit 'bout
Police comin {*puff*} put this shit out

[Chorus: Trey Songz] + (50 Cent)
You like smoke and you got me high (you know you make a nigga wan' put it down)
High (high feelin like I'm up in a cloud)
Girl what the fuck you've done to me?
You got me feelin like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoooooke - and you got me high (so high make your love come down)
High (one time have that ass turnt out)
Girl what the fuck you've done to me?
You got me feelin like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoooooke

[50 Cent]
Shorty hot, she full blown, she hot now
100 degrees, that's with or without the top down
But when she get to workin her hips, you know the temperature rise
Oh Lord, soon as she see the dick in her thighs
She like the stones in my cross, she flawless
I'm thinkin damn, why would God give one woman all this?
You know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me
It's complicated, my occupation pimpin ain't easy
Facts, I stack racks on racks and racks
Back when I was pumpin crack, now my cards are black
Nigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs
If I want it I buy it, I don't care what the shit costs
Luther said it, a house is not a home without her
I had them panties on the Greyhound filled up with powder
But when she showed me what she'll do for me, has no limits
Her wantin is temporary cause fo' sho' she gon' get it
What's up?

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz] + (50 Cent)
Everybody showin the love, when she at the do'
Burn this bitch down, that's fire in the hole
I'm tryin to hit it and hit it, don't wanna pass that
Got me addicted, I'm trippin, where the stash at?
Lady, baby - don't you know?
Lady, baby - just like smoke and got me high
So high; girl what the fuck you've done to me?
You got me feelin like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke and you got me high (ring the alarm, it's on)
High; girl what the fuck you've done to me? (ring the alarm, it's on)
You got me feelin like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoooooke (ring the alarm, it's on)

[Outro: Trey Songz] + (50 Cent)
Smoooooke, you're like smoooooke
(Yeah, my nigga what's up)
Girl you're like smoooke, smoooke
(Ha ha! Fuck with me!)</pre>
