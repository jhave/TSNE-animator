[Afu-Ra]
Blackie Chan too incredible
Molars crushed it, cause you edible
Pedal to the metal, shine lights up in the ghetto
I'm playin' my voice, on the streets, just like a cello
Modern day Othello, my bello, hell no, will never stop
Wanna get high from my mind? Got them yellow top
Fly around the earth, I'm all polite just like a smack spot
I chop stick it to death, while trynna hit the jackpot
Lyrically open, just like a crack spot

[A-Sun]
Fire burn, call me the solar monk, I got ya
Heated up, sweatin' from the lava
Oozin' out the system, volcanic eruption
I'm a natural disaster, sound clasher
Like stone love, illegal, broadcaster
Just because I spit, other people want
No comp, I don't walk, I stomp
Like ?Ole-Ah-Sah?, fire music, makes me high

[Chorus 2X: Perverted Monks]
So what's it gonna be, gonna be
Nigga, back up of me
Steadily, steadily
Locked you like a felony
Readily, readily
Bust shots, that's heavily
Poetry, poetry
Jump off the melody

[Ca-See]
I took change, but gave dollars
My innocense, laid on record
Spillin' sewers per second, plug it in and check it
Thug ride, natural order, of selection
Star child indeed, I heed, the best suggestion
You can bust all your weapons, I take all your shots
Power in my heart, yo, it's too hard to stop
Child, so I'm only takin' steps up
Every day something new when I press my luck

[Respect]
You see a nigga like me, sees all that I be in
This mindstate, illin', drillin', for a schillin'
Yo, I'm fine as a villain, so it's tossed up
We hum bangers at your drums, I'm the cage monk, what?
My focus, on skunk, while my fam set it up
Now I step off and erupt, P-Monks, what I'm ruckus
Spit jewels like fuels, floatin' through exhaust fumes
Wicked with these pens, grab a stick, transcend

[Chorus 2X]

[Afu-Ra]
Contested, bust caps, just like a western
Lyrical futuristic, like the Jetsons
My jet suns, spazzle, dazzle you lateral
We bleech through hover crafts for the collateral

[A-Sun]
Like a splish spash, tidal waves are splatterin'
Acid rain at the gathering, I'm traveling
Young master, aqua, and ravel ya
Bounce sparks, soft from my flow, and let it shock ya

[Ca-See]
Feel me now, scorchin' hot, the solar sound
Fire breathin', I'm releasin', lethal pounds
To the brain, information, increasin' pain
You lost in the moment, another man folded

[Respect]
See, what's smashed, mouth tactics, I blast ya cabbage
Spit concrete captures, to, match the masses
Lames, Respect crack back then peel
Gorilla warfare, store lead, like steel</pre>
