Typed by: timbaland01@juno.com

Uhhh, shhhh
Don't say nothin' just listen (For all y'all ghetto people out there)
Through like all the bloodshed
And all the tears and all the homies I done lost (Calliope Projects)
Ain't nothing like the ghetto
If I had to do it all again
I probably wouldn't change a thing

Master P:

I live my life homie, but not for greed
Picture young sistes and brothers planting their ghetto seeds
Ain't nothing promised in this ghetto but we lost cause we black
Picture 5 kids in the project in a one room shack
I had big dreams of making it big
I caught nightmares of fools splittin' my wig
I couldn't change for the guppies that tried to hate
Picture me a ghetto child with a house by the lake
Ain't nothing promised but we not to blame
Sinning, uhh to make some change
I wish the society feel my pain
Empty me underneath we all the same
High construction on penatentiary bars
They main focus is blacks with fancy cars
And they beat us on high interest loans
Repossess our property cause we don't think to own

Chorus (4x):

This ghetto live got us hustlin' and scufflin'
I said penatentiary chances keep us thuggin' and muggin'

Bun-B:

Now I was known for walking on the wrong side of the tracks
Slanging, smoking and drinking yack, reminiscing and thinking back
A lot of facts have been changed we take the innocent and guilty
I played the cards that they dealed me
Went through changes that dealed me
Into a better man but most often I'm misunderstood
Call me a gangsta 'cause I relay consciousness from the hood
But alot of good comes from what you call negativity
We working with no leverage or incentive g
'Cause their nothing you ever give to me
On television or them history books
Got black kids thinking they only out on this earth to be crooks
See all these mystery looks, that's on the face of the boss man
When he can see a young black brother no longer lost man
They try to break your spirit, before you figure out the game
By the time you do you lost your fame, reputation and your name
But baby we can do it take your time do it right
You don't wanna be a superstar overnight
Trying to live that ghetto life

Chorus (4x):

Pimp C:

I live my life for my son so he can have something
Blessed just to see a new day so I'm trying to grab something
I been on top of the world and at the bottom too
When you up you got lots of friends and when you down it's few
The way we grew up was wrong, I'm the first to admit
I know God and just drop me here to be going through this
I lost D-Ray last year and it's just not the same
Just at the time in his life when he was trying to change
He told me, Pimp I need help, I want up out the game
I made a promise, I lied cause the next night he died
I guess our childhood is over 'cause man ain't nothing funny
And everythign that I love revolve around sex and money
I wanna have some more kids but in the 90's that's crazy
The woman's polluted so it ain't safe to make babies
And it's a shame cause Uncle Sam ain't got no job to pay me
But pay the mightiest 40 g's for every year they enslave me
It's crazy

Chorus (Repeat 'til Fades)
