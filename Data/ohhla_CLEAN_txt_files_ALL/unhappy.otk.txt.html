[Intro]
Drowning in the gray cell
To dwell in earthly hell
A pimp warrior fell

One-two! Sir Lucious Left Foot in the muthafuckin' booth!
Lucious! (Lucious!) Sir Lucious Left Foot has just entered

[Hook]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
and your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
and your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
and your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
and your goose is cooked!

[Big Boi]
First rule in this thang, never let 'em see you sweat!
Never let 'em be a threat and your feelings you must protect 'em
As well as your rectum! Must keep self out of harm out of danger's way
Let strangers play while you graduate and move on!
True happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale
Unless you're in jail and trying to get a bail
bondsman to go on and post that bail
You would be happy as hell! You thought you was happy
until that court date came
Couldn't abort that case, nobody to take your place
Family home is at stake, too late to escape and get on the run!!

[Hook]

[Big Boi]
Once upon a rhyme, one time when I was a child (Flip that smile upside down now!)
When I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli
It was silly, 'cause my mom and pop they worked for every penny!
Didn't have many, but had enough to get by! Enough to get fly!
Only to start the New Year off in debt now you forget
Your happiness came and went
Like mom and dad's relationship, take a trip
You got the potato chips? I'll bring the hot sauce!!

[Hook]

[Big Boi]
1979 Dirty South, Local Lounge (Flip that smile upside down now!)
I never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness
Now what used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit!
Graphic language, mild violence and the silence of the the fams!
No members to remember, but I know just who I am
I've grown into a man and like my nigga said we executed the game plan
'Cause we got that Hot Sauce!!!!
