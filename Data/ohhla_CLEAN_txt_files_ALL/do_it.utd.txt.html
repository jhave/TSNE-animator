[ Mos Def ]
I know the Brooklyn crews like to do it
I know the Uptown crews like to do it
Yo, still the Boogie Down crews like to do it
The big U gotta step up...

[ VERSE 1: Ces ]
It's the Brakalak bounce no doubt
Critical Mass be in the lab makin the bass push out
Perimeters and borders, come and test the waters
I'm regal, plus I 'speak no evil' like Wayne Shorter
Loud and clear to make the hometown cheer
I freak it for my peers and those with ears to hear
Style bring style from around the aisle
Nice with the verse so I keeps the fat purse
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Sometimes I get these ill energy spurts
I put em inside my lines and I make the shit work
Cause I got it like that, okay black?
Flexin on my stack, son, get off the crack
Your crew get stalled if they ain't on the ball
With the 1-1-2, yes yes y'all
A-yes yes y'all and you don't stop
A-yes yes y'all and you don't stop
A-yes yes y'all and you don't stop
I said you do it, do it, do it

[ VERSE 2: Mos Def ]
Now I'ma take it right back to the place
Crazy snare claps with the humming bass
I keep a steady pace cause nowaday heads be hyper
Be actin all wild like they name was Rowdy Piper
Turn it off, man, cause it straight up earsore
Your style ain't really raw, so why you yellin?
Just another case of infinite rage
It only makes me more determined to come correct
So hell yeah, come and swing the vibe over here
And Mr. Mos rock you all out the atmosphere
Get on the illset agenda of the paragraph blender
The steel pencil blender of the hard and tender
Remember, back in the day you gave me no play
But that's okay, I'm maintainin anyway
And just bangin out cuts, bangin out cuts
Servin up the stew to make your nana wanna cuss
Comin out the deck with the grand royal flush
Ain't in a rush, there's no need to fuss
I keep my flow slow like a 26 bus
And leave a chump crushed when I excercise the vocal thrust
So (shush) from dust to dawn shit'll be on
Me and my pad and pen have seen nuff early morn
I work to seperate the grain from the chaff
Treadin on a narrow path by many told don't last
But I keep on and, I keep on and
I said the show ain't done, so where you goin?
I let the war and peace wind blow and
And when the ( ? ) vibrates you will know when
And us brothers need to learn to ( ? )
Ah-keep on and, ah-keep on and
Ah-keep on and
Son, you you better do it, do it, do it
Come on

Do it
I said you do it, do it, do it
Do it
I said you do it, do it, do it
Do it
I said you do it, do it, do it
(East New York)
Do it
I said you do it, do it, do it
(Come on)

[ VERSE 3: DCQ ]
I can't deal with others, so I stick to myself
Word is bond, I can't trust nobody else
Cause it's a lotta devils and a lot that's been mislead
And I'm about to wake you with a smack to the head
So go ahead and take me for a joke if you want
Got the side, middle, back, front sewn
(So leave the nonsense home
Before you end up leavin with a swollen dome
It's Mister M-o-s D-- on the microphone
And the ( ? ) yo, check the vocal tone)
I'm rockin shit for the young and old
Rollin down, creepin down hard and slow
So chumps best advise to act like they know
I'm gettin mad heated and I just might blow
(Yo chill baby, chill, just slow your roll
It's time to be a man and excercise control)
True, so I'ma just relax
Despite the fact that punks deserve a smack
It's the 21st, it's like this, it's like that
Nowadays shit be like mind over gat
If you're havin problems, just step to it
Don't talk about solvin matters, come on now...

Do it
I said you do it, do it, do it
(Come on)
Do it
I said you do it, do it, do it
(And out in Philly)
Do it
I said you do it, do it, do it
(In Atlanta)
Do it
I said you do it, do it, do it
(In DC)
Do it
I said you do it, do it, do it
(In Virginia)
Do it
I said you do it, do it, do it
(In Carolina)
Do it
I said you do it, do it, do it
(And out west)
Do it
I said you do it, do it, do it
(In Miami)
Do it
I said you do it, do it, do it
