[Master P]

where the thug girls at claiming red and blue.

I heard you jockin' Master P cause he got a mercedes
A bubble eye hummer but the feds can't fade me
you just wanna ride girls jump inside
cause I'm a 3rd ward nigga til the day that I die
I only fuck with thug girls when I'm on tha block
and i don't mess with no hoes that say they hot
All my fighting girls grab da gat grab da gat
and all ya stuntin ass bitches step back (ya heard me)

Chorus: repeat 4X

where the thug girls at
(Over Here Whodi)

[Silkk the Shocker]
They wish they knew I want a girl like you
Well, girl gotta be from the hood, but you gotta know what to do
Like beta hold the bricks, beta hold the clips
but when night time comes u gotta ??? hold da sh....
Now from the streets give me the heat
you gotta know what to do wit it,
Taz hit ya you  be like  I dont know who did it
Take the ??? off you guys never be like you did it
Real chick only let you hit it
Respectin by my clique stayin by her man
In public business unload get wild and thangs
She's real thats why i took her money and ice her up
If a chick gets outta line respectin me she gonna slice her up
If I give her some money she gonna know how to flip that
and if I gotta go somewhere she gonna hold it down til I get back
so Hoody Hoo if you about doin somethin
and hoody hoo if you about doin no stuntin

Chorus 4X

[Krazy]
It's about a fight tho we can fuck Baby waste no time
What you like in your drink girl lemon or lime
The way you shake on the dance floor got me hot
Lets Drive around the lake til we find the spot
I aint suprised that you gotta man baby its cool
Gimme one night with ya girl I bet you'll leave that fool
He probably thank you went to work when you came to the club
you aint lookin for afection you need a thug
I'll be straight up with you baby dont be his lady
A nigga like big lips cause I love some head
and if your girl wanna join I'm down with that
she can lick a niggas nuts while i hit ya from the back

Chorus 4X
