Verse 1: Trick Daddy, The Lost Tribe

You can't catch me boy
Don't upset me boy
Touch me my dog a wet 'cha boy
Never disrespect me boy
Dog you better check ya' boy
Cause I'll never thirty-eight 'cha I'll tech ya boy
Pray to God protect ya boy
Cause when it's on it's like Electra boy
I know you wanna go home but we ain't gone let 'cha boy
And if my money ain't right you better stretch it boy
Cause when it's bout that bread I'm sweat 'cha boy
You see I'm riding round in a lexus boy
Cause we rob a lot like a Texas boy
And if ya aint Slip-N-Slide I'll wreck ya boy
Give me fifty feet stay out my section boy
Disrespecting hoes like we sexist boy
You know a nigga keep a Smith and Wesson boy
I don't mean no harm just protection boy
We can shoot it out like a Western boy

Chorus: repeat 2x

I suggest you don't be (fucking with me)
And if you don't wanna die (don't be fucking with me)
Don't wanna lose ya' life (don't be fucking with me)
And if you ain't slip-n-slide (don't be fucking with me)

Verse 2: (Trick Daddy)

I went ahead and bought that Benzo boy
That bitch with 20-inch Lorenzo's boy
And the big crib is hittin boy
Bought me rollie with them bulletproof windows boy
Cause them jack boys you know that got the energy boy
Fuck if I offend ya boy
Got a place I'll send ya' boy
And a clip I'll lend ya' boy
Tell the morgue that a real nigga send ya' boy
Cause I bend ya' boy
And I want every dime that ya' got boy
I need some D's on my drop boy
And two ki's in the spot boy
See the real niggaz just want stop boy
Huh, we on top boy

Chorus:

I suggest you don't be (fucking with me)
And if you don't wanna die (don't be fucking with me)
Don't wanna lose ya' life (don't be fucking with me)
And if you ain't slip-n-slide (don't be fucking with me)

Verse 3: The Lost Tribe

You can't fuck with the south boy
Watch'cha mouth boy
Fucking with the tribe in this game a take ya' out boy
In 95 south find another route boy
It ain't hard for us to show you what we 'bout boy
Leave ya' dead with out a trace boy
I'm at 'cha funeral and I can't see ya' face boy
Ya brain is a terrible thing to waste boy
And ain't  'cha way to fast for ya' pace boy
It aint no thang for me to catch another case boy
Stay in ya place boy
Cause I'll have ya' ass erased boy

Verse 4: The Lost Tribe

You better straighten up and learn how to act here boy

So I suggest you don't be (fucking with me)
And if you don't wanna die (don't be fucking with me)
Don't wanna lose ya' life (don't be fucking with me)
And if you ain't slip-n-slide (don't be fucking with me)
