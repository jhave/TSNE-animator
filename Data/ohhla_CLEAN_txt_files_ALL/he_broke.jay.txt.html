Song:   Because He Broke the Rules
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Grandpa Joe] Wh-When does he get it?
[Willy Wonka] He doesn't
[Grandpa Joe] Why not?
[Willy Wonka] Because he broke the rules
[Grandpa Joe] What rules? We didn't see any rules, did we, Charlie?
[Charlie shakes his head briefly]
[Willy Wonka: springs up from his chair, angrily]
Wrong, sir! Wrong! Under section 37B of the contract signed by him
it states quite clearly that all offers shall become null and void if - 
and you can read it for yourself in this photostatic copy:
[grabs a magnifying glass and reads]
[Willy Wonka] I, the undersigned, shall forfeit
all rights, privileges, and licenses herein and herein contained
et cetera, et cetera... Fax mentis incendium gloria cultum
et cetera, et cetera... Memo bis punitor delicatum!
[slams the contract copy and the magnifying glass down, continues shouting]
[Willy Wonka] It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal!
You stole fizzy lifting drinks! You bumped into the ceiling which
now has to be washed and sterilized, so you get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!

The handling of a heart's a very delicate art cause it's paper thin
One irrelevant thought that started out as a spark could be a poisonous dart
That leaves a permanent mark, that's ice cold in the day and burns in the dark
And makes you never wanna see her face again
Tee-hee, what a place I'm in
Lead me to the station
A one-way ticket, don't look back
One cold tear that froze and cracked
A whole lot of pain I'm holdin' back
Chav said, "Eff that, roll the sack"
I said, "If my skull was cracked
And blood ran out to the cul-de-sac
That could not match me where I'm at"
My memories flash me there and back
Yup there goes me right there in black
Holdin' hands, not starin' back
She starts cryin' I start denying, it's my fault
And I'm aware of that
Man, in hindsight signs be glarin' back
Where's the map to show you where you're at?
I can hear the crowd yelling, I can smell the tire smoke
I can hear the starter pistol where's the track?
Ring no answer came home late
Jane told Dick she had a date
But they was just chillin' and at that moment
The right brain says to the left just kill em
Make the headlines, make the front page
Wild out in the court house man thrill 'em
They'll say, "The boy dead wrong," but I feel him</pre>
