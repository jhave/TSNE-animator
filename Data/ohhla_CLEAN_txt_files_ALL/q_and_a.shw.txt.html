[Party Arty]
Question: why crime cats keep on testing?
Answer: cause dirt bitches keep on stressing
The dirty dancer, cancer, 9th of July
So I srtike only when I'm high, no lie
So why? I don't know why I smoke lye
And stay so high trying to be the multi-
Billionare, niggas ask, you feel 'em there
Pull 'em here, over here, kill 'em here
And send 'em there, over there, where you rest
I stay double busted, nigga, where's your vest?
Is it a test or is it that they stress these rats?
Or is it the trees that make me want to bless these tracks?
These cats, GD cats, we be cats
Giving niggas lessons in the rap sessions

[A.G.]
Ayo question: who's whipping the black Expedition?
With that booming system, that'll be me
With these chickens in the back seat holding gats for me
Toting, flattering me, open, chatting with me
I write these rhymes and stay high
Be rolling in a black stolen driving by
And I'm holding, the only thing that I'm smoking is lye
With no cup, full brew, no cup, smoke up
I'm so clutch in big games when big names choke up
I'm so tough over Show stuff now flow's up 

[D-Flow]
Question: why Flow smoke a lot of hydro?
Simple, cause I like to feel clouds in my fucking temple
Maybe you high, I've been to
Puffing more than one, on the run is where I sent you
Must have forgotten I cut like a Ginsu
Bust off a shot to ride the rock instrumentals
Show you the gat, now you figure it's subliminal
Holding down the track, just me and my criminals
On the move, production Show and prove
Be a ruse, GD go win not lose
Got jewels, pay dues, got crews
Want to blow with us, roll with us, think they getting dough with us
Not here, you niggas step to the rear
GD get dirty and blow some Hershey in the air, what?

	All this is is choruses
	Phat rhymes and beats with kicks like Norrises
	We trying to get the money for the kids so peep how raw it is
	How raw it is, how raw it is			   	      (Repeat 2x)

[D-Flow]
I got rock ready in vials, niggas kill me with their petty styles
Tie 'em to the Chevy while I drag 'em every mile
Let the cheddar pile, I need designer clothes, find the hoes
Watch how the diamond glows, time to go, wind the more
Dimes to grow, you throwing mine to blow, you trying to flow
You brought the drama slow and I'm about crime and dough

[Party Arty]
It's time to shine and glow cause I'm the kind to blow
I'm loud, y'all rhyme is low, blowe with my nine to go
Time to blow Five-Oh and knock you down like dominoes
Got the gat between your eyeing holes, make you spine flow

[A.G.]
Well I'm a flow, shine with Show, your mind ghost
See the man behind the dough, you didn't get it? Man, you kinda slow
We, holding down that fort lovely
Us three terrorists like Die Hard 3
Rock Mercedes back to back followed by half a G
Topless, like the golden lady, yo I got 'em going
Crazy, Billboarding, cause of my ill recording
Think it's sweet, let the nine mil stall them
Kill 'em slow like Lauryn, full of dough when I'm touring
Me, Party, and Flow create raps that pack the Forum, so warn 'em

	All this is is choruses
	Phat rhymes and beats with kicks like Norrises
	We trying to get the money for the kids so peep how raw it is
	How raw it is, how raw it is			   	      (Repeat 2x)</pre>
