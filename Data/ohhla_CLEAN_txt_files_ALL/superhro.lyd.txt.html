Oh Oh
Ooh Ooh Ooh
I loved you, I loved you
With all that's in my power
I was used and abused
Til I was sweet and sour

I kissed you and kissed you
And gave you all my sugar
You knew that I'd be useless
If I let you know what you were to me
I thought it would be OK
And we shared everything
No way

And I told you, I told you
How I was such a sad case
You said you could save me
I'm doing the saving
Went to sleep with superhero
And he woke up a villain
Killing and killing my love
Oh, what happened?
Oh, no, what happened
You got me fighting
Like wonder woman, woman
But...

I, I, I don't wanna fi-I-ight
Don't wear no ti-I-ights
And I can't fly-y-y
I'm no, I'm no superhero-o-o

Oh, oh, oh
I, I, I don't wanna fi-I-ight
Don't wear no ti-I-ights
And I can't fly-y-y
I'm no, I'm no superhero-o-o
Oh, oh, oh

Oh no, don't know what happened.
Don't know what happened.
Don't know what happened.

I keep trying and trying
To wrap my head around it
Crying so can't let nobody see how I'm acting
You hurt me, you hurt me
And no not physically
Ain't got no bumps and bruises
To show people what you're doing to me

I thought it would be OK
But you see I heard everything you said
And I knew it, I knew that you'd turn out to be a sad case
You said you could save me
I'm doing the saving

I, I, I don't wanna fi-I-ight
Don't wear no ti-I-ights
And I can't fly-y-y
I'm no, I'm no superhero-o-o
Oh, oh, oh
I, I, I don't wanna fi-I-ight
Don't wear no ti-I-ights
And I can't fly-y-y
I'm no, I'm no superhero-o-o
Oh, oh, oh
Oh no

You got me
Using all my Kung Fu tricks, tricks
Hit 'em with the round house kick to the tempo
1, 2, 3, 4 hung hi ho, T.K.O, Tae Kwon Do
You know
When you see that hand go chop
Everything stops
The flow so hot
Like steam from a coffee pot

Rush hour, no traffic
No Jet Li, just Jackie
You acting like you stay behind
Go read up on your classics
You ol' fake-o wanna be superman
Give Clark Kent back his glasses
Man I hit you with a judo kick so fast
You look back like what happened

Oh, no
I, I, I don't wanna fi-I-ight
Don't wear no ti-I-ights
And I can't fly-y-y
I'm no, I'm no superhero-o-o
Oh, oh, oh
I, I, I don't wanna fi-I-ight
Don't wear no ti-I-ights
And I can't fly-y-y
I'm no, I'm no superhero-o-o
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I, I, I don't wanna fi-I-ight
Don't wear no ti-I-ights
And I can't fly-y-y
I'm no, I'm no superhero-o-o
Oh, oh, oh
I, I, I don't wanna fi-I-ight
Don't wear no ti-I-ights
And I can't fly-y-y
I'm no, I'm no superhero-o-o
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, no what happened
Oh, no what happened
Oh, no what happened</pre>
