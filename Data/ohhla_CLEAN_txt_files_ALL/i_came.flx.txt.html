[Intro: Reek Da Villian] (Vado)
(HUH!!!) Yeah! Reek Da Villian! (MOST HATED!!!!)
Vado! Strong Island! Huh! (HARLEM!) Conglomerate!
Reap what you sowed nigga! (BUSTA WHATTUP?!) 
Real nigga shit! Listen!

[Verse One: Reek Da Vilian]
B.I.G. will forever be the best 'til I'm deaf
But you are now rockin with the best of the rest
Things wasn't goin right, and the checks wasn't prepped
So I made about face and took them steps to the left
Now I'm where I wanna be, thousand dollar garments
Ridin around with the garders and commercialized starships
McClarens vehicles foreign, castles McCormick
Rappin like I should be holdin the mic on some deformed shit
Copped oil since the balls for your mom's list
Hoppin out the Phantom junior senior high promed it
Be alarmed I don't get involved with all the nonsense
Got shooters underwing for every hair on my armpit
Have my youngins put some shots in your V
Them copper tops go pop and drop in your T
We move rocks from spots and clock for the G's
Not from Yonkers but I keep blocks on locks with the D
My saliva in antifreeze DNA Motorworld
Givin these amateurs my number so they can have a protocol
Get it, yeah so they can have some protocol
I hit the car lot and go shoppin call that the motor morgue
Strong Island we wildin the farm loud that we plowin
My palm pilot get malice when four cowards be blaowin
The don pilots be crowdin and mob talents we stylin
Them dark alleys be foulin so calm down or be violent
HUH! 'Cause I'm heavy with dough
A weapon of mass destruction so I'm ready to blow
And don't do this with the kid unless you ready to flow
And whenever you feel you ready I'll be ready for show
GO! GO!

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Came through in a drop top
Killin e'rything you know who run shit nonstop
Shit knock like when the heat pop
Got the streets locked on like a nigga got a padlock on each block
Came through blowin money
Came through throwin money lame nigga know he funny
Tryin to test this mess with
Been the best since niggas invented the guest list

[Verse Two: Vado]
(SLIIIIIIIMMMMEEEEEEEE!!!!!)
Aiyyo Reek, what's the word slime?
No free stickin when I make the birds fly
Clear lane, shirt tie, I be ner-vous
In the box I'm like a bum on the curb high
Had enough time, you gotta pay
Everyone and they callin I tell 'em not today
Shottie spray through the same reasons that Gotta tape
Yellow wrist peein on niggas like I ain't potty trained
Dropped out a building, he schooled me how to run it
Who the budget, from 8 to 12 I mighta moved a hundred
Broadway, broad day, my niggas rude in public
Heard he eatin, his belly fell, then you shoot his stomach
Getin money is all we really do
Penthouse Times Square, spiral stairs with a city view
22 CL, the 550 new
I went to court with a killer you gotta kill me too

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Came through in a drop top
Killin e'rything you know who run shit nonstop
Shit knock like when the heat pop
Got the streets locked on like a nigga got a padlock on each block
Came through blowin money
Came through throwin money lame nigga know he funny
Tryin to test this mess with
Been the best since niggas invented the guest list
