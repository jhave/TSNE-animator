[Big V]
Heyyyyyy!
One of em's fat and loud, second one's black and proud
Third one's drunk and wild, fourth one slim and sly
One of em's just shy, last one young and wise
Homegrown, battle tested, you gon' love these guys
Brotherhood all you got, the best story told yet
Bonded against all odds, ain't no tearin them apart
Swore, panic, vile, till death do 'em in
Even in reincarnation they would do it again

[Ron Clutch]
Who would ever thought six different strands would lock together, locked forever
Rockin +Leather and Wood+, told you +Chicken and Grits+ go good
with some +Watermelon+ albums sellin coast to coast, across the seas,
Gave everything we could, our tears, our sweat, our blood, cause

[Chorus - Nappy Roots] 
I am because we are, we are because I am
Everbody say (We are a holiday)
Now throw your hands to the sky, turn up the music just right
We representin, why? (We are a holiday)
We are because I am, I am because we are
Hey, it's Nappy Roots Day! (We are a holiday)
Now throw your hands to the sky, bounce to the music we write
We represintin, why? (We are a holiday)

[B. Stille] (R. Prophet)
Now we stronger than wood, playa (we tougher than leather)
Us yeaga's hustle together (uh-uh, not just for the cheddar)
Look here we trustin each other (say, "um you fuck with my brother?")
You gotta suffer the repercussions, we come from the gutter
(White Kangol, white classics, striking suit with the matches)
Capitals came from the ostrich, blowin smoke out the nostrils
(Prolly trouble with student loans, we struggle for too long)
But now we can move on, put that on my tombstone
WE ARE BECAUSE I AM, AIN'T HARD TO UNDERSTAND IT
Far from a shootin star (rather play on my planet)
Power, respect (demand it) to us nothin was handed
PLAY IT AS LOUD AS YOU CAN AND, SAY IT JUST HOW WE PLANNED IT

[Chorus]

[R. Prophet]
Bring out your kids and treat 'em, cotton candy plus freedom
Raise one for cows and feed 'em, sweet as Shirly Temple's singin
Clown on the carousel horse, spin on the ferris wheel
Its magic floatin, smokin, takin up a call from Fish Scales

[Scales]
Man, we livin straight, health plans and real estates
Weapons we put away, we reachin out with Nappy Day

[R. Prophet]
Sparklers light up the dark, fireworks in the park

[Scales]
We eatin - shrimp a la carte, red wine, holly tart
Like soldiers comin home, watchin after war's gone
Sky's rainin confetti, singin out the Nappy meddlies
Get rid of felonies, wash away with melodies
Irish to Ebonies, Haitians to the Lebonese

[Skinny Deville]
As I jot down in my notepad some days considered important to me
The birth of my son, the day I signed my first recordin agreement
It was sorta like my soul to the devil and I was kinda like allowin him to keep it
But the true essence of this art form can't be confined to temptation and evil
Lost some folks on the grind to this bullshit but my real yeagas stuck around
So this day's a tribute a celebration, I am because we all stay down
Shit, I'ma keep it Nappy 365 and 7 days a week
We fortunate to make it out that trap cause the forest roots stay runnin deep
Yup

[Chorus]

[Outro - Scales] (Skinny Deville)
Today I'm feelin so alive, alive...
We ride, ride... (September 16th)
Today I'm feelin so alive, alive...
We ride, ride... (September 16th)
Today I'm feelin so alive, alive...</pre>
