(Chorus)
Shes a fairy with broken wings
I used to watch her perform 
And if she hears me I hope she sings songs
That had me going right back
Couldnt find anyone in town to talk 
Bout how no one like that 
Should be confined to the ground we walk

She glides but just seems like she floats
And these folks decide to crush her wings until there permanently broke
She rides gusts of wind just by the way she spoke
She crys but loves to sing songs of freedom and hope
On the eastside hustling discussing things that we quote
In shallow conversation as if we have deep throats
We chokin on confusion
Now show up as a heat stroke of we need coats
Trading in our cheap jokes for her c notes
I see notes being passed
I ask to see what these creeps wrote
Define silly kids and flying privelages revoke
Ski slopes have been blocked off they cant transit 
Had weights tied to her ankles she most definitely cant skip
Down, shes held down by the transripts my hands grip
Tried to tie her wings back on before the ones again clip
Panic stricken, shell remain stuck
On a titantic sinken, shes tryin to stay up
Change her plan thinken its ok
See this is strange but
Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves in a way that kept them chained up
I'd like to see
Her take flight into the stars
Instead of letting her fly free they keep her in jars
Instead of letting fly free they keep em in jars
I put my hand to the glass so hard
It might break the prison bars 
It isnt hard to see why they keep her captive 
Shes naturally attractive 
Speaks with adlibs, shes uncommonly talented
Aint enough adjectives to do her dispotion justice
Kids are wishin for just a kiss and its a mission to touch her lipstick
Cant trust her with 
Freedom of movement thats a chance to loose her quick
If she ups and splits 
We might as well call that discussion quits
If we's to keep her down the government's underlinks 
Enslave people in this town especially if there cultures rich 
Exploiting talents making it do a bunch of tricks
With the rest of the wingless imports
Repeatedly told you aint a ferry just a bitch
Just a bitch, with a butt thats thick
So rub your tits, and thrust your hips
And suck my dick, and run your shit, and run your shit, and run your shit

(Chorus)
Shes a fairy with broken wings
I used to go watch her perform
And if she hears me I hope she sings songs
That had me going right back
Couldnt find anyone in town to talk
Bout how no one like that 
Should be confined to the ground

(Verse Two)
When I was down in New York she'd send me letters 
And I read her passages about how I left it to the savages
No matter how sad it is I didnt cry 
Cause it was only a matter of time 
Before they figured me out and tried to strip my pride
I knew the scoop 
Wish you could of seen the blueprints in my eye
When I flew the coop
Utilizing overground railroads in the sky
It was live or die let me let you in on the secret of mine
Me and you are different girl 
We dont even need wings to fly

We dont need wings to fly
Me and you... we dont need wings to fly
Keep on singing give it a try, give it a try 
Just keep on singing giveit a try, give it a try (5x)</pre>
