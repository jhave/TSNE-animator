[Kool Keith]
Tashan (Junkadelic)
I move in the area, for respect, Tashan Dorrsett
Draft pick by Seton Hall
Escaped convict out of Marquette, sonic I'm Stet
First man, to fly to the moon on a private jet
Rocketship Express
Exhaust pipes burn the hair off your chest
Brim over my head, cocked to the side like El. Ness
Chicago chronicle, move with Elvis
with Jaycee and Will, I'm bound to get ill
Hit the P-day Parade, my daily brigade
cooler than that glass nigga dressed up like a jar of Kool-Aid
I'm too fade
I'm cuttin your fame down to miniature size with two blades
I'm not out for fun, we don't have time to stargaze
Me and Ollie light up the street like Dr. Spocky
Girls hang on the jockey
It's all c'est la vie, well c'est la C
Two minutes to go

[Chorus: Ced Gee]
It's the international connection
We makin hip-hop perfection
It's Ultramag and Junkadelic dawg
We about to teach the whole world a lesson
about how to rap, how to make beats
How to walk, and how to even speak
And if you learned your lesson right
you'd be at the top of this game
You'd get all the shine you want, you'd get fame

[Ced Gee]
Oh yeah son, I guess it's time for Ced to go
So let me hear this track, oh yeah dawg, I like that flow
So I'm about to bless you with 16, just like a pro
You know how I gets down, I keeps it real simple
The swagger's incredible; son I always smash my foes
Son, I'm always, smashin hoes
Son, I'm always, collectin dough
So if you see me up in Harlem, don't even think about it
Cause me and my faction squad son, we bout it bout it
We take care of our business; beef, we don't forget about it
We squash your whole team, your whole squad get routed
It's like that in my hood dawg, don't even doubt it

[Chorus]

[D.Eazy]
(Junkadelic) I smoke Newports, don't fuck with Marlboros
I'm tryin to be in the streets, see the Marlboro
You don't understand you gotta live with the borough
Stand still nigga wanna act like he thorough
Missed his vertabrae when I sprayed ten times
and buckin, niggaz askin questions like they still duckin
The bug is filled with brains and cranium cracked
Never did give a fuck if the stadium cracked
I understand that's how you feel whenever you get jacked
But we still on the track, Ultra, Magnetic
Niggaz is askin questions but I'm just so pragmatic
Mathematic, sometimes I gotta come back on the beat
with two times five divided by pi you see
It's like this, inside of your eyes you open
Niggaz talk shit but the beam's still open

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah yeah yeah~! (Junkadelic)</pre>
