[Intro]
Oh, it's Plies again (I chase paper)
Hey I just had somebody come up to me and ask me (I chase paper)
"What do you do for a living sir?" (I chase paper)
What you told 'em? I told 'em
"I chase paper, what the fuck do you do?" (I chase paper)
If you wanna know what my occupation is homey

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I chase paper (twenty), I chase paper (fo')
I chase paper (seven), I chase paper (homey)
I chase paper (Monday), I chase paper (through)
I chase paper (Sunday), I chase paper (homey)

[Plies]
Hustle now, sleep when I'm dead
Niggaz with paper, they go fed
Grandma told me, that's where I'm headin
Gon' chase paper, can't be scared
All I know, I won't beg
Owe me paper, I want my bread
Don't wanna pay, I want yo' head
Yopper loaded, under my bed
Gon' chase paper 'til I'm dead
How much paper it's gon' take
Just for me, to be straight
Me to be rich, I can't wait
All I do is paper chase
I don't got time, I can't wait
Cause I need millions on my plate
I chase paper, all day

[Chorus]

[Plies]
Wake up early, lookin for a check
'Til I get rich, I can't rest
Broke and black, now that's stress
Wanna break bread with me? Be my guest
When I got paper I'm at my best
Only money can fix my mess
Tired of Chevies, I want jets
All I need is one big lick
I want now, I don't want next
I want paper, he don't want shit
I want mansions, he want a bitch
That's the last thang on my list
Without paper I am sick
Paper ain't there, I want it
I chase paper 'til I quit
The mo' I hustle, the mo' I get

[Chorus]

[Plies]
I lost it all, I almost cried
Can't sleep I got bags under my eyes
I need paper fuck bein tied
I need paper mo' than I do wife
If I go broke I would die
Hustle longer than nine to five
Can't be broke got too much pride
What's after broke? Suicide
Been chasin paper all my life
They hatin on me, that's alright
I need haters, they my high
Easy gettin the mo' you try
Paper chaser, that is I
Hundred mill', still won't retire
My brother in prison, chasin it now
Say I don't chase paper? That's a lie

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, I know all about chasin paper bruh~!
Three albums in sixteen months homey
I know all about chasin paper
This how we comin out the gates homey

What time it is bruh? What time is it bruh?

Either they hatin or they tryin to be just like me
Either they hatin or they tryin to be just like me</pre>
