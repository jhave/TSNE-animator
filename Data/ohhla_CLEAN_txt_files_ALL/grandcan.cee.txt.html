[Cee-Lo Green]
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh {*4X*}
Heyyyyyyyyyyyyy you!
If I build a bridge, could I, come on over?
And sayyyy
You look beautiful, even from so far away
Heyyyyyyyyyyyyy there!
I wish I was the winnnnnnnd that, blows your hair
Don't cryyyy
If I could, I'd walk right across the sky

[Chorus One]
I see the woman for me
On the other side of the Grand Canyon
Could that beeeeee the woman for me
on the other side of the Grand Canyon

[Cee-Lo Green]
I'm screaming, to to the top of my lungs
No one has heard a word, I had to say
The wind, blew them awayyyyyy
Heyyyyyyyyyyyyy there!
I love youuuuuuuu
And oh it's not fairrrrrr
Whyyyy, can't I flyyyyy?
Cause

[Chorus Two]
I see the woman for me
On the other side of the Grand Canyon (Grand Canyon)
I couldn't see clearly, the woman for me
on the other side of a Grand Canyon, ooooh
