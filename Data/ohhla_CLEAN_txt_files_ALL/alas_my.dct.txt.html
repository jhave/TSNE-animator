Alas my love, you say goodbye, Wipe the poison from my brow
Alas my love, this guilty night, It gives me up like a foster child
And in this moment I take my vow, These angels sleeping at my feet
And in this moment you do not know how, How my spirit wants to flee

You see it was one man against the night, Taking on a multitude
That had left him high and dry
No candle burning vigil could light the way
Darkness hit the ground like a fallen satellite
He wrestled until morning
With human souls and dark angels
And there he finished his work
On the third day</pre>
