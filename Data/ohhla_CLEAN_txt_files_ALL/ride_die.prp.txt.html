[Chorus: Spice 1]
Nigga we boss up, Ride or die
Look at us lay low ridin by
Fuckin wit us might cost ya life
Nigga we boss up, Ride or die

[Verse 1: Spice 1]
I heard one bitch nigga scream get the gat, Get the gat
So I dumped on his homie like blllat blllat!
Tryin to catch you slippin but I always end up pistol whippin 'em, whippin 'em
Hittin 'em, Stickin 'em, Puttin clips in 'em, Clips in 'em
Hittin 'em wit the 45, Motherfuckers be buried alive
I doubt that you and them bitch-ass niggaz you rollin wit gon survive
Bust in his eye, I'm comin, Steady pumpin the fire
Rumblin by, Niggaz run and stumble and die
Bitch, I'm savage, You niggaz is butter like popcorn
I hopped on the hood of his caddy and chopped on him
Through the front windshield, Nigga you should've been peeled
Snatch 'em out the seat, Put 1 in his dome, A done deal
We bossy, We ain't nobody's boys, Strapped and armed
When you so motherfuckin soft, Niggaz wanna squeeze yo charmin
Little honey blunt dipped-ass cupcake nigga
They knew i'd shoot it up, So they planned yo wake quicker

[Tray Deee]
Hit the do', When I open, When I came to get in
And i'dve kick the motherfucker straight up off the hinges
Nigga challenging my talents is a sentence to death
Cause I'm steppin in a battle wit a clip in the deck
Crip is the set, So you ain't gotta ask if I bang
Deadlier than threat, Be drivin long beach niggaz insane
Bringin heat to any table that I step to eat off
Top dogg of that street, 21st so keep off
When I'm on the mic, Other rappers just speak off
Matter fact, Shut the fuck up and just ease off
I'm mobbin wit my speezies from the bay all day
Catchin felonies, Cause my lyrics stick like shanks
While the funny mc motherfuckers spit like blanks
Droppin cavi out in cali, Shit that hit like quakes
Ball out, Crawl out, Before you catch these vapors
Dogg house, All out, Keep it gangsta, Gangsta

[Chorus] 2x

[Verse 2: Yukmouth]
Nigga we savage, Raggin tighter than lions, Crazy life
You know we violent, Niggaz get stole on like kobe's grindin
In this game, You gotta move in silence
Saw big on the news blind red sirens
That means yo crew dyin
Bulletproof 22's grind pick up grindin
Duckin and divin, Runnin for their lives, No shuckin and jivin
Outside, Where niggaz be hustlin runnin
Motherfuckers strugglin and strivin to be that next head bubblin
Tumble like me, In fatigue, Kamo kaze
Smoke weed, Until my eyes bleed, Kemo sabi
'Proach me, Tryin to rob me, I'ma bop he
Make 'em scream like Bushwick, I went and shot you in the body
Probly, But you a bitch, I'm a nigga wit a tommy
Copy, I'm a hustler, You a snitch like johnny
Copy, I'm that nigga Yuk, Sick as fuck
Gettin head in a nine six truck, Bitch nigga what?

[Jayo Felony]
It's summertime back in my city, They think they can see this here
But y'all gon have to get wit me and deal wit me this year
Yo career is like chump change, I'll put it in the cup drop
And give it to crack smokers fat back on 47 block
Ya had to put somethin wit it to buy king cobra
Catch ya smokin stress, Weeded bizarre, Then smoke ya over
Nigga, I ain't goin wit y'all, Cause y'all niggaz is gang bangers
And I ain't no gang banger, But now, You'se a gang banger
Fashion crip, You know you been afraid
You just tryin to let yo hair grow but the scalpel's too tender for braids
And if you was a baby, I'd smash my finger through ya soft spot
I'm hot, Dumpin out in the open on 1 shot
Catch 'em on 33rd street, Cut off his bird peak
Don't make me turn clay street into ak street
Ever since I blew up, Seems like these bitch niggaz is mad
But now, I gotta pull ya covers back bitch, My memory ain't bad

[Chorus] 4x</pre>
