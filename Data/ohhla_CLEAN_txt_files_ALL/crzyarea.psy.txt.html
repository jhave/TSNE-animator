Crazy ass Psycho City blocks street ghetto red hot 
Dangerous slums woods lost hoods burnt spots we live in 
Killing fields death fills 
Concrete jungles rumbles ill 
Sick projects swinging steel 
Real towns around you get killed 
  
The players in the scheme unfold and flash guns 
And fill our thoughts with fuck everyone 
Plots will involve action 
And leave crooks in hiding crime on the run 
Cops run around and patrol 
But cant handle the vandal big psyclone 
Crash wants me gone 
So we all fight and die and the crazy area lives on 
Welcome to wild raid zones 
Where sirens will pierce your ears like deaf tones 
Move fast and dont get smoked 
Cause echoes of a massacre flood the ghetto 
Stroll the roads downtown 
Where the residents are masked with sad faced clowns 
Come grab your straps and get down 
And drown the streets in murder surround sound 
  
In this jail cell we call hell and dwell 
In well kept project homes built to tilt whats real 
We manage to kill any chance with true skill 
Imprisoned until we give our lives as payment for bail 
We will feel the sting misery sings about a king 
Who brings angels with stripped wings 
Fallen rings turned cliques who click arms in wrong street nam 
Destroy calm and bring fatal winds that birth harm 
Create alarm by dawn theyre releasing the bomb 
And were unaware, numb, entranced like shakes charmed 
Fatal bond between us and bullets 
Give us better gods for premature death than Russian roulette 
And wholl pull it raw dog analog, mind fog, thoughts clogged 
Crooked action ration is camouflaged 
Passion is sabotaged were livings heartless 
But there doing dirt the ones who spark this 
  
Crazy ass Psycho City blocks street ghetto red hot 
Dangerous slums woods lost hoods burnt spots we live in 
Killing fields death fills 
Concrete jungles rumbles ill 
Sick projects swinging steel 
Real towns around you get killed
