Typed by: OHHLA.com

Let 'em know the funk bandit's back 
With more bounce to the ounce it's the brat tat tat tat 
The funk-keeper 
Competition's sweet but known for makin' speak 
Cause bleed smokin haloweed 
Givin' You what 'cha need 
Indeed I'm nice 
Jewelery full of ice 
The industry ain't been the same 
since I came to sprinkle my spice 
Tonight's the night and we gonna all get lifted 
Recognize the gifted and how there's no fuckin' around 
in the west-side district 
Get it twisted 
If you wanna choose your destiny 
Leave all that simple shit at home 
And bring your fuckin' best to me 
Cause right here playtime stops 
Okay, rhymes flop and all that real-deal shit hits tops 
See I'm the cream of the crop, head bitch in charge 
And there ain't nothin' or nobody that I've barred thus far 
Repitoire full of wicked shit 
Lay back kick a shit 
All the right shit to give a nigga a hit 

If you let's nuthing hold you back 
And your limit is the sky 
Throw your hands in the air and let's all get high 
Roll up a fat one and pass it around 
Lay back hypnotized to the funky sound 

Repeat 1x 

KRAYZIE BONE: 

Now roll up a sac so that we can smoke it together 
Now how high can you go cause you know we can choke 
Take it slow, We smoking junk 
Cause you rolling wit moe 
We having a celebration 
We doing this all night if you wanna get away 
You can play em other times 
And don't forget my niggas be doing this shit the thuggish way 
We have you thugging where the thug lately? We Krayzie 
But niggas don't drop we got the bud blaze-ay 
So if you get out. Better get with this crowd 
I bet you wanna get weeded 
Fuck wit your thugs out of Cleveland 
Stay peyoted and tweeded them thugs we blazing we fiending 
Now can you feel this connect with So So Def Mo Thugs 
My squad and yo posse my nigga we goin be alright 
So come around everybody party down get down 
And let that real shit hit yo' chest cause I know when I get that hydro 
My nigga thugsta come and give me some love 
Can somebody bang and slang yo' dog with couple of thugs from the
cut 

You wanna fly, you wanna fly, you wanna fly 
We could all get high, get high 
The shit we keep we got you hypnotized 
Ain't nobody dealin' with me 
My nigga J can get his smoke on man 
Cause if we go broke you won't feel bad 

DA BRAT: 

Yeah. But there's enough hundreds for that to never happen in action 
Certified platinum slashin' bastards 
Draw shit faster than eastwoods, I wish you could be like me 
I broke the Mo with fatality, visual shit that you can see 
These synthetic niggas usually smoke refos with my peeps 
Get deeper than any bitch 
Watch me and yo' nigga creep 
Sky's the limits, Damn them lights cause Krayzie got the Hydro 
Inject a deadly venom grinnin' and watch them all die slow 
We non-fictional characters carry grudges till it's dealt with 
Underestimate the wrong bitch and get yo' shit spend 
You better light a splife and mind yo' motherfuckin' business 
Or get that ass put in the witness protection program 
Till I'm finished, diminished 
Your entourage is my level 
Blindin' like the VVS rocks possessin' like the devil 
Pushin' custom drop-tops 
Keep Segante' in the glove box 
Puffin' with crooked cops 
And can't nuthing hold me back cause nigga my shit don't stop 

KRAYZIE BONE: 

You wanna fly, you wanna fly, you wanna fly 
We could all get high, get high 
The shit we keep we got you hypnotized 
Ain't nobody dealin' with me 
My nigga J can get his smoke on man 
Cause if we go broke you won't feel bad 

Repeat 3x </pre>
