[VERSE 1]
You don't wanna see these murder guys
Princess cuts hurt ya eyes
Got the chicks that work them thighs
Pull the top back on the prowler
Like the car ain't circumcised
Burglarize hoes
Leave ya eyes closed
Bricks in my truck while I ride slow
Smoke yo fire dro
No repercussions
He was disgusting
Turn my volume under ten
To keep my speakers from busting
If them people come rushin
Can't say I froze
Won't open the doors
Bout time they caught up
I done exposed of my outer clothes
Car in the garage
I say good God
My day was hard
Call two freaks up for the ménage trois
Parlaying hard
Sade was suave
When we was screwing
Sheets was ruin
If beef is brewing
I'mma put slugs deep into
Money they be pursuing
The nerve of these jealous bastards fo hatin
Master my patience
Them custom wood grain caskets is waitin
Passion for satin
They must have
Gave them a blood bath
Had to show them who really holdin shit down wit they tuff ass
We alias
They wishin they be us
Cant three eighty us
Cause we'll wreck everything within a ten-block radius
When ya see me betta speak with love
Or leak some blood
I got connections with all type of BM, Chiefs, and GOVS
Deeply plugged who gotta retire from crime
Bout to hit that big lick
So we gonna pull it

[CHORUS]
One last time
I got some good news man
Some good news
We gone come up if we just make this quick move
Lay it all on the line
Hit'em in the body and da dome
Left the after party wit the chrome
Come up wit a milly
Soon as everybody know that I'm gone
Cause I made it mama your son he's a success
Now you ain't got no reason to stress
Gotta keep it Gangsta
Cause I'ma Hustla
Do it like a balla
Cause I'ma a mobsta

[VERSE 2]
Cause it only takes a second to pop me a snitch
Call up my connection and cop me a brick
And he sent a chezovoceian chick
She was actin cocky and shit
She like watchin blow at the hotel
Wit big dreams to never stop being rich
And she wasn't too sloppy wit dick
Said when she get on she was gonna cop me a six
Platinum blue spreewell shoes
Detail smooth
On some Mickey and malery me and my female crews
Type of demo what's the beno
I gave her two six plus ten four
That's twelve five for the brick
And five hundred for the plane and limo
Plain and simple called my guy and told'em thanks and send more
Meditating plot on my lick when I smell them frankensen blow
Do my thugdizle I ain't scared of this
Fly ya head like peagus
Bloody up that necklace
Hoe I'ma Aries
Them terrorist fucked up the lick when sendin chicks on the plane
Put a major glitch in the game
But I'm get me them thangs
As I come wit new ways to travel watch my shorties get on em
Comin back wit pound and packages wit the scorpions on them
Of course we been on them
Niggaz know they two for forty and want'em
I done seen truck load wit more keys than accordion
And you think I'm past up that quick fast dust
let me mask up
That ain't a fast truck
Get yo ass stuffed

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 3]
I spit words that be gangsta shit
Make hustla tip and ballers rich
Hatters sick mobsta hitz
I'm the shit
You can't see me visit the optometrist
Cars I flip unorthodox like Dr. Bonovich
Prada lic but nigga got whooped
Should of seen shit was funny
My old connection he got reason to gun me
I know he took the money
Even if I probably wrong
Turn down the volume
Shoot him on plastic to lay his body on
Fuckin marcon
Two to the caveza
Pincha puto
That ring on your pinky was too cold
Got pinch for two O's
And a half brick my staff is sick
Had him confess like a catholic
Always thought things was funny now you don't laugh at shit
Stupid bastard bitch
Never fuck wit Twista, Turtle Banxxs, and Stokes
Coming up dro flowin slangin dope
I tried to chill
but when I see a lic to make the world mine
On the love
I think I got to pull it

[Chorus]</pre>
