Capone:
It takes nothin' but a hot slug to fill a villian 
Crook I'm about to make a killin' 
So weed to escalate the feelin'
I regulate the dealin' jealous niggas hate the feelin' 
I stack my safe appealin' jake on my trace I'm peelin'
And what a Mecca had whole fuckin' nation kneelin'
Embrace the wheel and hit a buck without crashin' fuck
My drug passion got a nigga stashin' fast what
One love to hill billys run forever out to Chile'
Playin' the cuts nigga what can't stop the willy
Cops harassin' niggas blastin' while the day' passin'
Time for action cock the mac what a satisfaction
Shoot laughin' slug caught up in the chest gaspin'
Nigga blanked out chopped before he start rappin'


Hook:
Khadafi:
Microchips in the celly the game don't stop (don't stop)
Tappin' in your bank funds with the labtop (labtop)
Wanna own a block before the ball drop (ball drop)
Arab natiz puttin' hits on the cops            (x2)

Noreaga:

Street niggas that' grown men 
Bold face gat in your face stay in your place
Yo crime lace catch more beef then Scarface      (x2)
Court case illegal minds too late 
Back in '92 (you remember Juice son?)

Cell block cold crop 
Go bagged up yeah by cream cop
(FUCK THE WORLD) The way the world cold dissed me

Collect all from Arab natzi the fowl motney
You were lat in jail gte what what what what
Them new jacks they comin' through 
Scared to death of the jail stories that's true
You cold weak live life on the street
While locked up homoed with pink sheets (bitch nigga)
Discrete and your cell shook to sleep
I wild out no doubt till the day I'm out
Me personally what I did three kid you weak
Your station and P.A.C. 

Outro:
