[Baby {talking}]
I got that work
(For sure)
I got that work, nigga
Hustle - death if you hustle with us
(I'll front ya, boy)
'Cause I'ma put that work on your life, lil' one
({too low to hear} if you're shined out with a nigga)
It ain't no secret

[Baby]
I'm that nigga, Baby
But my niggas, they call me Atrice
Every bitch I fuck gotta be above average
On another level, nigga - millionaire status
Just bought two mansions: one in Florida, one in Dallas
I'm a boss nigga
Buy whatever, don't give a fuck 'bout the cost, nigga
I like to floss, nigga
It ain't no secret: I'm the number-one stuntman
You come at me wrong, you'll be in the trunk, man
I'm a O.G. shot caller - Big Tymer
Cadillac, Hummer, Jaguar, Benz driver
Thirty-six-ounces-in-the-glove-compartment hider

[B.G.]
Don't test the water - look, believe B.'ll ride

[Baby]
Nigga, I'm a millionaire
Tote two guns 'cause I've been there
Lil' wodie, you don't wanna go there
I'm fuckin' all these hoes

[Mannie Fresh]
Y'all better believe!

[Baby]
And I'm tellin' the next rappin' bitch what's up my sleeve, wodie

[Hook (Turk)]
Bitches say we stunt too much (much)
It's okay 'cause we can back it up (up)
Know you gon' let us do what we do (do)
Rock our Rolie, ride drop-tops, too (too)

[B.G.]
(Look, look, it's a- it's a- a checkmate, checkmate)
Ain't it a bitch how I be stun'n - I know, but I can do that
I pull up, top down on a Prowler, they be like, "Who that?"
Common sense should tell 'em it gotta be a H.B.
'Cause don't nobody stunt like them niggas from CMB
Baby had me reppin' since I was in the sixth grade
'Cause niggas wonder how I'm eighteen and already made
I done been through it - from bustin' heads to doin' time
Now I'm on that level to where I got the right to shine
Me and my clique hit the scene - Ree's, jeans, and T's
Wrist, neck, and ears just shoutin' *bling*bling*
We be thuggin' to the fullest - stay handlin' hoes
'Cause all of 'em the same: straight scandalous hoes
I ain't trippin' - they can ride in the whip with a nigga
But put your head down and donate your lips to a nigga
Tossin' bitches is a hobby 'cause me and my niggas share
Gotta respect that's the life for this Cash Money Millionaire

[Hook (Turk)]

[Mannie Fresh]
(What, what, what)
I know y'all sayin', "Look here - what the fuck is that?"
A Space Shuttle, lil' daddy - made by Cadillac
Take that other shit out, and put Corinthian leather
Put a sun-roof top for sun-roof weather
They go, "Whooooo!", when I fly by they shit
They go, "Oooooh!", you diggity? Just don't quit
I like 'em one short, one tall, one a doll
I like 'em on their head in the bed against the wall
Turbo-charged dick slinger...
...pussy banger
...pain-bringer
Nasty in-and-out finger
See that girl that you're with - I did that shit
Any girl that you get, I'ma hit that bitch
Last year: helicopter playa - hello
This year: plushed-out, pimped-out Space Shuttle
You like gorgeous Lovely, I know you do
And if you're a real hot girl you'll let me fuck your crew
For real, though

[Hook 2x (Turk)]

[Turk]
Let us do what we do, let us do what we do
Let us do what we do, let us do what we do
Let us do what we do, let us do what we do
(Let us-)
What, nigga?
Let us do what we do
