[Intro]
Let's fuck his ass up! {*4X*}
We fucked his ass up! {*4X*}
Now call the ambulance! {*4X*}
Flatliiiine~! {*4X*}

[Unk]
Fo'-fo' ducked off in my Chevy, let's fuck his ass up
And if a hater buck, let's beat they ass up
I'm black ski-masked up, whatever is whatever
I'm watchin niggaz posted mixin fruits and goose together
I keep that black Beretta, I call that bitch my heater
And if you play me close just like a bitch man I'ma skeet ya
Them Western twins'll meet'cha, can greet'cha like a feature
And change up all your features, call the Red Cross to treat'cha
The club is off the meters, they crunk they doin they dance
Security better check 'em, or we gon' throw them hands
Now A-Town stomp that ass, watch me bow his ass up
(Ay, back up!) Call the ambulance cause now you fucked
Ready to pick yo' ass up, and take you on the stretcher
We fucked his ass up, I hope that God bless ya
Your team ain't here to help ya, you don't want it with us
I told you that we gangsters, let's fuck his ass up

[Chorus - same as Intro]

[Unk]
(Flatine!) Is he gone? (Flatline!) Lil' shorty dead
(Flatine!) He bust a move (Flatline!) We rocked his dreads
(Flatline!) Fo' to your dome (Flatline!) I split your wig
I'ma grown-ass man, I don't play with fuckin kids
These niggaz swear they hard, these hoes think they bad
But when it comes to beef, they all act like drags
Sissies punks and fags, yo' life is slippin fast
I hope you go to heaven, Tupac gon' kick yo' ass
I think you need to breathe, I'm cold so niggaz chill
Smoke you a blunt or kush, go try to get a deal
Niggas bustin f'real, Big Oomp we tote the steel
DJ Unk off in the 'llac, ready to twist yo' cap back f'real
