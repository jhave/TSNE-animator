Song:   Biz Dance, Pt. 1
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Verse One]
I'm the Biz Markie, I'm known for beatboxin and rap
And now it's time, to put Long Island on the map
And lettin you know, that it'll put you in a trance
It's somethin funny made by me and it's called the Biz Dance
I think the way I do it is so unique
By the way I move my hands hips legs and feet
But if you think that you can master it you got a fat chance
Cause it's very difficult to do, what is it called?

[Chorus]
The Biz Mark, Biz Mark.. the Biz Mark, Biz Mark
The Biz Mark, Biz Mark.. the Biz Mark, Biz Mark, Biz Mark

[Verse Two]
The Biz Mark Dance, is second to none
I'll explain at the moment how it should be done
Kick your legs 'til your pants almost rip
Shake from side to side, witcha arms and hips
While you're doin it, if you mess up your hair
Then you know party people that you're halfway there
They've heard of Biz Markie all the way in France
And the kids in AntARCTICA is doin my dance!

[Chorus] - 2X w/ ad libs

[Interlude]
Now everybody out there that wanna learn the Biz Dance
Come up to the front, all the ladies to one side
And all the homeboys to one side
And I'ma show you how you should do it
You should throw one leg to one side
And then throw the other leg up to the other side
Then throw your leg up above your head
And then, this the way you do it
One.. two..
One, two, three, here!

"Go Biz Mark!  Go Biz Mark!  Go Biz Mark!  Go Biz Mark!"
"Go Biz Mark!  Go Biz Mark!  Go Biz Mark!  Go Biz Mark!"
"Go Biz Mark!  Go Biz Mark!  Go Biz Mark!  Go Biz Mark!"
"Go Biz Mark!  Go Biz Mark!"

[Verse Three]
I'm the Biz Markie, I'm known for beatboxin and rap
And now it's time, to put Long Island on the map
And lettin you know, that it'll put you in a trance
It's somethin funny made by me and it's called the Biz Dance
I think the way I do it is so unique
By the way I move my hands hips legs and feet
But if you think that you can master it you got a fat chance
Cause it's very difficult to do, what is it called?

[Chorus] - 3X w/ ad libs

[Outro]
Now I know Fort Greene can do the Biz Dance
And Queensbridge can do the Biz Dance
And Atlantic turtles can do the Biz Dance
White {?} Lawanda can do the Biz Dance
40 and Baisley can do the Biz Dance
And Astoria Projects can do the Biz Dance
Everybody on Farmers Boulevard can do the Biz Dance
And I know Bayshore, C.I., Amityville, Wyandanch
Brentwood, Corey, everywhere in Long Island can do the Biz Dance
Hempstead, Shreveport, everywhere can do the Biz Dance
Manhattan, Lincoln Projects in Colonial can do the Biz Dance
Even the Bronx Co-Op City Bronx River can do the Biz Dance
But, they can't do it like me, HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!</pre>
