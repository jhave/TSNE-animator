[Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott]
Been caught up in the fame, a part of the glamour and glitz
Platinum rings and different things, how easy we forget
For it is Him the Lord Almighty, who allows us our success
We on top, above the charts, how easy we forget
Do you think without Him, you would be who you are?
For if He made heaven and earth, He also made you a star
So as we reach the year 2000, you know there's one higher than us
And I come to be that too, to tell you, in God we must trust
Love you...</pre>
