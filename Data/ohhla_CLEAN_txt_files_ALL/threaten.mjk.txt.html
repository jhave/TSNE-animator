{Rod Serling Intro}
Tonight's story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh yes, I did forget something didn't I?
I forgot to introduce you to the monster

{Michael, Verse 1}
You're fearing me, 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream it's 'cause of me
I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I know just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me

{Chorus}
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

{Verse 2}
You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me I'm everywhere
In one blink I'll disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you
I'm telling you, when you lie under tomb I'm the one watching you
That's why you got to be threatened by me

{Chorus}
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

{Rod Serling Rap}
The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear

{Chorus 3x}
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

{Rod Serling Outro}
What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly
terrifying nightmare. It isn't. It's the beginning</pre>
