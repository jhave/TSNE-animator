[First Verse]
If it's on I'll kill my own like a Civil War
This EBK, what the fuck should I be civil for?
It's over, pour into my bullet tips
Split you open like a pinata cuz you full of shit
Manana nigga I'ma do you non-believers bad
With heavy artillery like Sigourney Weaver had
Cuz you an alien or foreigner up in the town
Either you or I, do or die about to shut you down
Bout to hunt you down like elk in the woods
In the hood nothin' else expected
Accept it, it's what I protected
No excuse, nothin' else respected
Known to shoot whenever we tested
Shit is about to get hectic, Chaos!
You gone need the sounds to bring you back from where you rested
May God Bless it
I'm agnostic so keep that!
Pure toxic up in your eyes, nigga peep that
We know where you sleep at
As we speak my peeps is mashin'
And we know that you weak ass bunglin' bitches is who we snatchin'
She catchin' hollow rounds
Shots to the head make a hollow sound
Got away with murder, PARANOID!  I push this bottle down
One sip put the bottle down
And blaze a blunt this one's for you
Now you rest in peace, no hard feelings bitch I swear it's true
If it's necessary Black Market do what's called for
And best believe when it's time for war we all go
And we all know nothin' comes before this chessboard
Two knights and kings fightin' screens, yes Lord

[Chorus]
I'm spittin' venom like a moccassin
Grab a glock, CHAMBER, droppin' men
DANGER, in my RANGER, and I got to win
DELUSION, no ain't no killin' X-Raided cuz I refuse to

[Second Verse]
Bet all them fools'll know, funk if they want it they got it
All my proponents is riders committin' murders sporadic
We quick to get up inside ya blow out your thigh boy
Psychotic shootin' while yellin' "You got to die Boy!"
Never should've crossed me, flossy glossy like fresh made varnish
With a reputation too solid to be penetrated and tarnished
Harness rage, it's strong, let it loose and you flagrant
Produce a strap from my draws, introducin' slugs to the vagrants
Statements was made so foul, niggas is funny style
Tell a hundred niggas you hate me but when you see me you smile
But all the while, you thinkin' muthafuck X-Raided
But in your heart, you never really felt you could fade it
Debate it, what I represent nigga, this G.B.C.
Northern Cali freeway from the Sac-Town back down to the M.S.G.'s
So hit the freeway, no lee-way cuz this ain't your zip code
You keep your lip closed
Or you get those lips swole
We got your shit exposed, stay the fuck away from us
We'll light you up and disappear like we vaporous
My cavaliers, wearin' battle gear, run up in your fort
Put bullet holes in your shorts
Left you dead on your porch
Then we torched your spot, my cohorts got counts calculated
Shout out you hate it
That's what you get for doubtin' X-Raided
Deport your corpse in where the cops'll never bother to look
Rigormortis decompose you, served ya, bored, and now it's over

[Chorus] (2x)</pre>
