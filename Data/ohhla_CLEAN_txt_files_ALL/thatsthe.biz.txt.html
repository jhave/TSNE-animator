[Chris Barron of Spin Doctors]
When you take me, by the hand
Tell me I'm, your lovin' man, OH!

When you give me, all your love
And do the best, the very best you can (the very best you can)

When I give you me, in your home
When we're all, all alooooooone
When you whisper, sweet in my ear
When you turn, oh, you turn me on

[Chorus - Biz Markie w/ Chris Barron singing (Spin Doctors)]
Ohhhhhh, that's the way, (uh-huh, uh-huh)
