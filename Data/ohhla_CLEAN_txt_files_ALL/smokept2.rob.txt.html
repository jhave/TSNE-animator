[Lil' Rob]
This is dedicated to the 6-1-9
These are the vatos that been, but now it's my time
To kick the beat's, move suavecito
To all you fine chicana's, Lil' Rob is doing ?
Bumping the oldies, It's me Lil'' Rob
And the Brown Crowd homies, turn up the volume
Yeah, Natural High, a ?? for my friends
And Lil' Rob will cry for la raza
because we killin' off each other, it's sad
BOOM, there goes another, but we don't need that
Because tonight it our night, it's the Brown Crowd night
And everything will be alright
So get up, go out, and do the brown thing
Let's cruise, no need to gangbang
So get ready, dress to impress
Because you got to make this start your very best
Not just another night on the town
It doesn't brown ?? Chicano, were proud and be brown
Tonight were crusin' in your lowrider
Let down the back and put the front a little higher
And now your rollin' TJ ?? just be yourself holmes
No need to be fake because everybody out here
Is havin' a good time, Oh what a night..Oh what a night

[Lil' Rob]
Sup ese
What's up ese... what you know me man?
Simon I'm your best homey and you don't even know me

This vato came up and said "hey what's up holmes"
I said "you know me?" he said "simon I'm your best homie
You were born in September of 1975
You're already 20 I'm the reason why you're still alive
I watch everything you do I've seen everything you've done
I kept you out of jail because I told you when to run
You packed a gun at the age of 13"
This vato knows everything about me but this guy I've never seen
So I said "what you mean?" and he said "follow me"
I'm going crazy that's exactly what it's gotta be
He said "let's fly" so we took to the sky
He said "stop, look and listen pay attention
Now if you have a question then ask"
Oh by the way where you takin me?
He said "stop, look and listen and you will see"

Chorus:
Listen hear what I'm saying
Listen hear what I'm saying

1-What's up
2-I think I saw him standing over there just a minute ago
1-Who?
2-Lil'' Rob, he's pretty bad on the mic you know?

Lil' Rob...
Lil' Rob...
It's the Wicked wicked

Puto's slip and trip
I'll rip them open from the heart to the brain
I'm already insane, and I won't change
You can't stop this, so stop this nonsense
People got this, because they want this
So watch above this
Little cholo, oh no
Lil' Rob comin' with mi stilo
My lyrics are like a bullet, out of a cuete
It's time to reload (an reload)
And make sure I never run out of ammunition
Until I finish my mission, fix it
All the mistakes that these puto's make
Go and grow up, shuttin' door's in your face
So that you can't blow up
You know who your fuckin' with
Lil' Rob con Coneta (neta)
Leva you can bet cha bottle
Del la hando puente can I follow as I lead the way
And I'll say no to the bottles that you meet some day
Never fuck with the calm one, the one who like's to kick it
It's me the sly, the slick, the wicked wicked wicked wicked</pre>
