Song:   Good Girl
Typed by: cinnabunz82@hotmail.com

You just left a good girl (good girl, good girl)
A good girl you lost today
From such a good thing (good girl, good girl)
From such a good thing you walked away

Thought I was your guiding light your angel
Why didn't I know
Was prepared to sacrifice my halo
I was buggin out

Everybody
Would come to me
Tellin me
The things they seen
Your girlfriend
Who lives for the limelight
Well that's alright
If that's what you like

You just left a good girl (good girl, good girl)
A good girl you lost today
From such a good thing (good girl, good girl)
From such a good thing you walked away (you walked away)

How could I mistake us having sex with making love
Said I'll never know
How could I believe you knew what real love was
As real as you could know

Everybody
Would come to me
Tellin me
The things they seen
Your girlfriend
Who lives for the limelight
Well that's alright
If that's what you like

You just left a good girl (good girl, good girl) (oh, oh, oh, oh)
A good girl you lost today
From such a good thing (good girl, good girl)
From such a good thing you walked away

I reminisce to that moment
You held me close (you held me close)
Said we could rewrite history
So how could you blow it
Now this song has no notes (no notes)
So what will the angels sing (I guess nothing)

Thought I was over my life's biggest hurdle
But oh no, no, no
It seems destiny's arrangement's circles
But that's how it goes

Everybody (everybody)
Would come to me (come to me)
Tellin me (tellin me)
The things they seen (things they seen)
Your girlfriend
Who lives for the limelight (limelight)
Well that's alright
If that's what you like

You just left a good girl (good girl, good girl)
A good girl you lost today (you lost today)
From such a good thing (good girl, good girl)
From such a good thing you walked away (you walked away)

You just left a good girl (good girl, good girl)
(not really a jealous girl)
A good girl you lost today
(my heart opened doors to a place you could walk through)
From such a good thing (good girl, good girl)
(more pictures than any girl)
From such a good thing you walked away
(truly your best friend someone that you could talk to)

You just left a good girl
So I'm single now</pre>
