[Chorus]
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like
[Repeat 2x]

[Kelis]
Told him what I like
When he heat it up at night
Made him stand behind my door and watch me (uh uh uh)
And I couldn't believe the type
He was saying all the right
Whispers gettin' mami right, I was (uh uh uh)
So I had to get the ice
Homie wanna fly the kite
Had to show him what a pro I was (uh uh uh)
I was headed for the light
He refused to take a bite
Till I put my blindfolders on
I'm saying something like

[Bridge]
You just taking it all, what's gon' be left for me
I told you get it, but you're taking it all from me

[Chorus]
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like
[Repeat 4x]

[Kelis]
Hold up
Let me take this off
Just to see where I can catch my breath at all.
Hold up
You got a pretty strong team
Got somethin on the bench that Kelis ain't seen
Hold up
Why you treat me like that
Bout the 3rd or 4th time you ain't had to do that
Hold up
Won't you let me cheat once
And I promise you won't never make me keep this on

[Bridge]
You just taking it all, what's gon' be left for me
I told you get it, but you're taking it all from me

[Chorus]
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like
[Repeat 4x]

[Nas]
The last thing you get
Is a blindfold and a cigarette
You willing to bet
Like an ocean cruise
Mami, I'm so addictive
How long I('ve) been stroking you gives you motion sickness
Grant your wishes
I leave you four senses
Smelling, feeling, tasting, and hearing
One minute I'm gone
Next I'm reappearing
The bed is the bentley
I'm doing the steering
I got your eyes in the veil
With your hands all over my tattoos
Like your reading the braile
Like my wine
With a spicy aftertaste
Though you fine
I like to cover up half your face
If you blind and can't see
What I'm bout to do
The suspense so intense won't allow you to move
Gonna surprise you
Like Hugh Grant in 8 and a half weeks
Kelis and Nasty

[Bridge]
You just taking it all, what's gon' be left for me
I told you get it, but you're taking it all from me

[Chorus]
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like
[Repeat 8x]</pre>
