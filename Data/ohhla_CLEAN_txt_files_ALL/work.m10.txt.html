[Talking]
Nigga wanna hustle
Nigga wanna sell dope where we grow up nigga
Ride with me and learn something nigga
If not - stay away my playground nigga
Yeah! - this shit right here is for real hustle niggas
Real street niggas - y'all follow me
Squared niggas - kick back and listen how is shit really go
Uh!

[Verse One]
Cabbage work hoes goes spoke and pistols
Last in getting away hearin whistles
Scopin down map gestural back full of chips
A hot ass scraps ski mask and two in the clips
Scoop on 'em motophone let 'em know it's on
I pack use 'em draws homeboy - nigga we goners
Beep on 'em Mexican though - we won't work
No Baking Soda slides twenty on 'em for the dirt
Got 'em - strap on 'em my shell with ducktapes
See nervous - while the Greyhouse escpae across Interstate
Jumpin up in the friendly scotia down chicken weight
For the work show up - and really do - be straight
They pull up bread all the lookin flawless us a show dog
Twenty bird and rally car like she a mother law
Damn! - she'll need no duck the law
Bitch got us switch walkin with the work like motherfuck the law

[Hook]
That's the shit nigga ball fo'
How they dope that they wall fo'
Jumpin on ' em hoes
They floss the hoes
We carry choppers stole us on homies with calicos
With the funk kick - wishin y'all holy copy with those
Banged out, thanged out - everybody hangin' out
Whole crews anybody sayin we bust used
Go back - blast the gas about to shootin' us
For cabbage work hoes and hundred fo's

[Verse Two]
Now in the N and N.Y. talkin' to why dies with the bitch
And some load ki's me insider
It's now and never - turn back why should we
Let's turn this bitch upside down (how could we)
First to be unnoticed - I don't trust that bitch
She fine - but she mixed with rat the lil snitch
I don't feel right I know crass bustin bust pipe
And the fed I had up on punk ass snitch all night
Where we better do - is send that bitch to the ?
Take the ki's to the rally car and get that bitch the cap
She go be mad about it cause she getting cut out
But just let it know her job is done (bitch butt out)
Why we here for? - (nigga we here paper chasin')
Okay then - well let's made this put reservatoins
Bust - train or even train station
If you got motophone we can start this operation

[Hook]
That's the shit nigga ball fo'
How they dope that they wall fo'
Jumpin on 'em hoes
They floss the hoes
We carry choppers stole us on homies with calicos
With funk kick wishin' y'all holy copy with those
Banged out, thanged out - everybody hangin' out
Whole crews anybody sayin' we bust used
Go back - blast the gas about to shootin' us
For cabbage work hoes and hundred hoes

[Verse Three]
Now I'm the KING OF ROCK - for my work
One time shoot the block I did my sack about the dirt
Like a dream team - both feams tryin' around me like impressed
Takin' fifth G horse and spork the dope 'port
Like a hell is seen hot for shit - I ain't trippin'
Got folks in the bushes with the chop chop - so I ain't slippin'
None of these out of town C's and Beems
Niggas playin 'em gueens street they never seen the pontrees
Hobbed on the plane - I'm back on stinky greens
And Inglewood floss and faded the whole scene
1-0 back Ol' T  - dope grindin'
Fresh gear, big wheels, jewels shinnin'
So I hit Shall Sunday - watchin' with low-low's hot
Me and my N.O. partners - on the strippin' new drops
Bentleys, Warreys, Benzes, Hummers
With none full of fall for the next twenty Summers

[Hook]
That's the shit nigga ball fo'
How they dope that they wall fo'
Jumpin on 'em hoes
They floss the hoes
We carry choppers stole us on homies with calicos
With the funk kick wishin' y'all holy copy with those
Banged out, thanged out - everybody hangin' out
Whole crews anybody sayin' we bust used
Go back - blast the gas about to shootin' us
For cabbage work hoes and hundred fo's

[Mack 10 {talking}]
And there you have it - that's how it go
From top to bottom - half heart, half money nigga
Oh - don't get it fucked up
I still got money for my first trip out of town
Haha!... you dig!</pre>
