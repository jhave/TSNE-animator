Funk upon a time
In the days of vanglorious
The tri-dimensional houses of energy
released the original powers
to the translators of the interplanetary funk code
Funkin religion, funkin lesson
Key bearers, funkin to the East
Earth bound

[Professor X]
Mmmm
We are messengers, of Ra
Whispering the secrets of the ages
Vanglorious!  This is protected
by the red, the black, and the green
with a KEY!  SISSSSSY!

"It was nearly eleven, when I started to return.
 The night was unexpectedly dark.
 To me, walking out of the lighted passage of my cousin's house
 it seemed indeed black."

[Brother J]
What is.. we are..
Dum-diddy-dum to the God's new drum
Devils run, here comes the sun
Brothers travel for ages
Scroll and stake from planet to planet
I take a ride on the cosmos
The utmost toast of my raft
Now mortals want a dose of the voice of key
with the bass of the great war chant
So now it's on to the garden at a million vibes a second
The pyramid tries to beckon
The sands of time, survive the flood
The bricks of blood, the house of the heart
on the tri-dimensional level
On to balance with the feather
Funkin lesson vibes to earth, from Ra on to Jeb
My verse it bled, bring chaos to order
The abyss to the earth to the waters
Vanglorious sound on the rain comin down
Verbalizer with scroll, earth bound

[Professor X]
I am, the blood of the pharoahes
The spear bearers, the elephant riders
The everlasting conquerors
I AM, the original power of blackness
The strength exampled, in our people as a whole
I am the voice of unearthly soil
Earth bound, by will of the Creator

[Brother J]
From amongst the stars, in a universe plane
Great void, the funk code plane
Going back to the ending, the beginning
Degrees ever spinning, in a world of divisibles
Black is black and before that original
Great pyramids served as tomb, but power;
child in the womb
I awaken to raise the flag, ahh, from the zero
War, zoom, devils, doomed
Eternal souls, living as those who are chose
To live for the nose
My boots bear soil, in respect of the elders toils
Bearskin rug, walk in flames, vultures swoop on the boiled
I free my mind and my spirit follows
I bring words of the wise
Coming to the earth on the likes of rafts
coming from the moon to the Nile, earth bound

[Professor X]
In the land beneath, I come knowing the earth bends over
Wrapped it's legs around darkness
And black waters both glide (?)

[Brother J]
Let's take a trip through space, without no suit
I'm an Afronaut, I'm the original traveller, and unraveller
of all mysteries, I touched the world like a child plays tag
Speak the code then depart upon raft
Over moon with the chants of zoom, who are you?
You wonder, forever
Never never, a million years, key bearer
The cosmic storm, illogical coming of chaos
Again, earth dweller comprehend
Religion on wax
The facts of the living, the phoenix flies
Wings scrape the sky
and surveys the eys of two, zoom
On to the temple, zoom
Mortals fears, brothers tears, war is declared, zoom
Disrupting the devils convention
Paved in hell are the gravest intentions
but in my home devils burn, think about it
Til a Brother returns, to Zod

[Professor X]
I have come like a priest in (?) skin
Having crossed the Nile by boat
Having come through the gap in the mountain
Having walked like (?), restless
Like a rabbit from the depth of his hutch
Blinking at light, I have come
The mission, the Nile
The destination, the crossroads
And then.. (zoom, zoom, zoom)</pre>
