(Hook)
Red Cafe:
I'm so fly, so fly
You might see a nigga if you look up in the sky like
There he go, (there he go), there he go, (there he go), (there he go)
There go that motherfucker

Woman:
I'm so fly, so fly, so fly, so fly
You might see me when you look up in the sky like
There she go, (there she go), there she go, (there she go), there she go
There go that motherfucker

(Verse 1)
Fabolous:
I'm so fly they should put me in disguise 
My shits tight like they didn't put me in my size
I already know don't put me on surprise
They gone be like there he go if you put me in disguise
Only be with winners they should put me as a prize
And you pussy niggas should be put between some thighs
These diamonds here clearer than HD
Them niggas over there squarer then a H3
They can't reach us that is why they pointin baby
I'm on my job them bitches gonna need appointments baby
And if you suckas tryin to see me just look me up
I hope the first place you look be up 
Here I go

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
Red Cafe:
Ugnh I did it yup yup i did it
I'm super fly wit it paper arrives wit it
Get the magazine if you wanna vibe wit it
That rich young queen like I mixed Tide wit it
Now I be live wit it
I turns on my lovers the lollipop girls 
Now they are all suckas
And we are all gutta
The flyest of em all 
Light fi fire to em all
Yeah we airborn I took her airborn
Stones clear Like her mama was Liz Clairborne
I'm goin down down baby 
Your street in a Spur flyin you see the blur
Ugnh what else!

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
Paul Cain:
There he go!
Im doin my damn thing (there he go!)
Leanin off of that champagne (there he go!)
It's the homie they call cain (there he go!)
I'm gettin money you fools should do the same (there he go!)
Fly as a G4 plane (there he go!)
White and yellows all in the chain (there he go!)
Y'all niggas no I stay so fly 
Got the top down when i blow by
With the dough I am multi 
You know why

(Hook)

(Verse 4)
Freck Billionaire:
Ayo you see this the drop head coup I just added room
It's so crazy I should park it in "The Padded Room"
I'm with my bad young bitch she Israelian
Nigga, she so bad she got em staring like she alien
Philly B the one the bitches wanna deal with
Nowadays I just screw them like a drill bit
Straight Homicide and murder every verse rappin
Philly Freck bitch I'm flyer than the first captain

(Hook)

(Outro)
Fabolous:
I'll take it, no contingencies
No loans, no leases
Cash, Fabolous</pre>
