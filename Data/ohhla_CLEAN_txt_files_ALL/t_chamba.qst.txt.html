[Chorus]
Welcome to my torcha chamba
Welcome to my blood stained room
Gonna see your worst danger
Gonna meet your final doom

[repeat Chorus]

Lock me in with strange put me in a rubber room
It won't help a bit with when ill thoughts consume
My mind losing all rational thoughts in reality
Multiple personalities battle me
And I snapped cause I cant control the things that I do
I wanna hurt people when the fantasy's through
I walk in the dark and I look for my victim
Like a Pit bull I see them and I sick them
I get so much joy out of seeing people bleeding
They took my cat scan showed the vision of a demon
I fiend in blood like a crack fiend wants drugs
I love dead bodies with maggots and bugs
Yes I wanna stab, slice, stomp and beat
Freddy has nightmares about me on elm street
Where did I get all this aggression and anger?
I take it out on people when I'm bring em in to the chamber

[Chorus] - 3X

You walk through the hall you can hear the muffled screams
It aint a bad dream but its worse than it seems
Blood is splattered everywhere it don't matter
You afraid, piss in your pants cant hold your bladder ?
What's the matter did you see my cruel experiments?
I do all of this sick shit for my own merriment
People getting stabbed, people getting hurt
People getting shocked, people getting burnt
Nothing compares to the pain that I inflict
So close your eyes bitch I'm just too sick
No one ever made it out except this one nigga
But he left here permanently disfigured
Cause I pealed off his skin, took the skin off other men
And then I sewed it on him
Hispanics, Asians, whites and blacks
He looked like a quilt he had different coloured patches
Then I took all the skin that was left
I made a dope outfit and I sported it myself
No one knows the pain that you're feeling
Blood dripping down the walls and vital organs hanging from the ceiling
Come on down to the chamber underground
Ropes and chains leave you tied up and bound
No one gets out when you're here you're mine
Q Strange can't stop committing crimes

[Chorus] - 3X</pre>
