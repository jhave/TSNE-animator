Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
All the time that I see, give you my word that I be yours
A lot of niggas tryna catch up with that
But they don't seen what I done seen up in these streets
Crack addicts and dope house, how many you want
We grew up in the scrubs,
But now we at the dealership with all our friends
Holler that, how many you want
You electrical and exceptional and inside of you
Is an angel named St. Michael,
He say he's in there to protect you and never lie to you
It's so hard to be faithful, but you sing to me
You hold me down, I'm a try for you

[Chorus]
Come here, you swearing I be yours [x2]
You drink and I be yours [x2]
Gal, you in'hear what I'm sayn
You rockin', I be yours [x2]
Do that, everything that I need and I'll be yours
And you know that I will: one word, and I'll be yours [x2]
And you know that I feel, that's my word

[Verse 2]
Either your friend got my back
She just mem' it, but she feel it
And she goes to eat somebody's time and shit
We gon' kill it
Either mine on your wrist, that just somethin' for today
Driving Rolls for the week, Subaru for the skeet
Got that condo for the month
You get massages for an hour
Red lipstick on my body print
I can see the way you seducing, I promise

[Chorus]
Come here, you swearing I be yours [x2]
You drink and I be yours [x2]
Gal, you in'hear what I'm sayn
You rockin', I be yours [x2]
Do that, everything that I need and I'll be yours
And you know that I will: one word, and I'll be yours [x2]
And you know that I feel, that's my word</pre>
