Typed by: CruisinInBlue13@aol.com 

Yeah dog i ain't lying man 
One shot..uh 
Sometimes it's all you get though man 
One shot..uh..yeah 

[Chorus] 
You only have one shot its fatal 
All your chips on the table 
A baby boy in the cradle 
We'll keep you well enable 
Keep your family stable 
Stay up and stay the fuck out of jail 
??? 
On your on label 
Kick back and smoke 
Nothin but the KO 
World famous, business on pay roll 
Pimped out we just lay low 

[Verse 1] 
When i was young i did pay no 
I never listen to no say so 
I always bubble my centino 
Always keep it on the serio 
Crazy ass vato 
Spittin' nothin but veneno 
On a whole nother level ya mero 
Where it's a brown badboy in romero 
It's a whole nother hueco I'm dealin' with 
Gotta home in the ghetto where I'm livin' in 
If it's on then it's on 
Remember me taking out you suckas 
Especially if it's the enemy 
If you catch me on my worst day 
You'll be needing first-aid 
Three days later your lookin' ? 
Close casket in the valley of assassins 
When your quick to catch your last kiss 
Get a hit with a desas i got this rap shit mastered 
Same book new chapter 
Bring out the ghetto bastas to sign on 
With the Latin rap icon 
It's my turn so high my eyes burn 
Urnin for what I'm earnin' 
I rip it to god's ? 

Chorus 

[Verse 2] 
Look at the gangsta bitch 
My gangsta ride my gangsta rag 
My gangsta night my gangsta life 
A G model 
Holdin' the microphone like a bottle 
With only a minute until tomorrow 
? guns rapping' to the kick in the drum 
Bangin' with the click to tha one 
Grease, slugs, hoes, scrubs, shows, clubs, drinks, and drugs 
Riding' like a ? in the bloods 
I put my bud in the buck 
I took a blood to the dome 
With my mind on my money 
And my hands on my phone alone 
Ridin'i'm gone you know I'm drunk and I'm blown 
Bitch i shit on your motherfucking song 
You gettin' me wrong 
I'm to grown for gangs cadge 
And AK with ? 
Eating heavy like every day 
Best be ready to play 
Spray, ready da rage 
Stained bullets on ? 
So what cha gotta say? 

Chorus 

Hey no eyes closed allowed on the Eastside 
G's rides on 24/7 
And G rides gonna bubble to ghetto vest 
You never know 
Tech 9's to the chest watch bullets blow 
I roll with the 40 holdin' and rollin' another one 
In the lowered impala 
Gun shots to follow 
Hallow tips and bottles 
See arrest to get wet we smoke out 
On them bouncin' on half an ounce 
And bangin' on them 
Affiliated with the shaved heads 
We spray led 
You better offer is trying to play dead 
Or brained dead 
All you vatos that wanna be rappers 
I'm laughing at chu you 
Like your callin' your shots 
Your block is talkin' bad about chu 
Talkin shit but you down and you AIN'T BROWN! 
You ain't even fuckin' with my town 
Bustin' out with the los on the Glock 
You catch him one shot 
Down fuck up and get dropped 

Chorse 2x 

Yeaaaaahhhh 
Come on 
Pi...pimp out and just lay low 
Haha 
Celeb 2000 
Hehehaha 
That was then, this is now 
Part 2 </pre>
