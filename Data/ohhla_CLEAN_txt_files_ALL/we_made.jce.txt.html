[Juice speaking]
"They say there is no hope for the young generation. I beg
to differ. I feel like we gon' go there, you know. You all
just got to trust us. It's like they don't trust us. When
you think about it though, it's up to us to make it happen. For real."

[Chorus] [Kahea]
Don't worry about what happen then
Just know that we can win
Keep your head up and smile within
YOu know we gon' make it
Doesn't matter if they don't believe
You know we will suceeed
Got through the bad times to live the good times
We gon' make it

[Verse 1]
Now we possesing old souls but we young folks
I figure generation X will give us some hope
We all some lost souls, all seeking knowledge bad
It's all the same, whether dropouts or college grads
And 2001 was timulturous
Tith all these terrorist attacks on our culture, plus
In NY, we had to watch the buildings crumble down
And Lisa "Left Eye" is gone, so we humble now
To tell the truth, I still bug on how Aaliyah left
But if you look when it's cold, you could see her breath
"One in a Million" girl, and there ain't too many flows that I can do
But Ness, he made me hear the soul in the sample
Funerals, the only time the hood come together
And when a kid pass away young, he's young forever
Preserved in the image that the good lord made him
Generation Y, they can't fade him, No

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I'm chilling with this gangbanger from the west side
He ask me why am I alive and all the rest die
Little hustler, he had just lost his best friend
Somebody let the pistol blow like the west wind
I told him, death is like magic, homies dissappear
I mean, we know their spirits living, but we miss them here
I told him, "Player listen, you were blessed to be hear"
Finally, took a puff of smoke to make him see clear, see there
He been hustling for three years, spillin malt cheap beer for this tee's peers
Little chip, so I asked him "Where's your momma man?"
And he said, "Well, she's with Dr. King in the promise land."
I told him, "Do your thing but never lose your focus
My only hope is that you learn about what hope is."
And oh yeah, I know about what selling dope is
To tell the truth, we do the same thing in show biz
Now keep living

[Chorus] plus
Though we came to get paid, and sometimes it's not the right way
But if you learn something this day, we can make it

[Verse 3]
I used to hang on the block, with the glock
From six o'clock to six o'clock
I used to tell all the haters, forget me not
Then the whole world found out I MC hot
These old folks call us thugs right
Big rims and froze ropes, we love life
So I have to say something to today's youth
Whether you sipping grey goose or pray to Jesus, hang loose
There's nothing that can stop us, no crooked coppers
It's time to get our proppers, now's the time
Broke, I done been there a million times
Cheese that don't melt, little children crying
And that's why corrupt thoughts fill their mind
Cats come out the projects and still they shine
So whether MVA or NBA, call my niggas on the block
I'll simply say, keep hustling
