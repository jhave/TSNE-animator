*Patti Labelle "Somebody Loves You" plays*

[Chorus: 2x]
Somebody loves you baby..
oh oh oohh..
Somebody loves you baby..
ooooh, ooooh, ooooh

[Verse 1]
Wish I could hug every nigga who done lost a trial
And go see all the ones that ain't visited in a while
To all the goons that down, wish I can help 'em smile
To show my niggas I love 'em, I'll walk a hundred miles
Bless my dawg who got killed in his own house
Help him pull through if he on life support now
The only thang I live for is to make my son proud
My heart go out to all the young niggas runnin' wild
I said a prayer for all the mama's who done lost they child
That 12 year old who wanna fuck, GOD slow her down
In life all dis? Help her turn it 'round
Please reach out and help her GOD before she drown

[Chorus:1x]

[Verse 2]
I know that feelin', when it feel like nobody care
When you goin' through yo problems..
It seem like nobody there
I started to question myself, "If god really care"
Sometimes I cut off all the lights in the room and stare
Wonder if he brought me this far, to drop me off here
I know it seems sometimes that life ain't fair
The say the only thing you can count on in this world is prayer
I prayed so much, I thought that god couldn't hear
Cause I done been through some much bullshit this past year
It's hard to find mufuckas 90% sincere
The streets make it so hard for you to think clear
I'd give up all this shit to have my brother hear

[Chorus 1x]

[Verse 3]
I gotta call from my homegirl...her mama died
Somebody home invaded and took her life
And just held the phone and listened to her cry
She kept repeating herself, all she asked was "why?"
Could only imagine what she going through on the inside
Cause when my brotha went to prison... half of me died
Ain't nothin' but pressures in this world, homie they lyin'
You gotta take the good with the bad..
And take it and stride it..
The right amount of pressure could make you commit suicide
But imagine the pressure on a nigga who can't provide
When everything goin' wrong, it's hard to do right
You goin' through it right now
All I wanna say is...

[Chorus]</pre>
