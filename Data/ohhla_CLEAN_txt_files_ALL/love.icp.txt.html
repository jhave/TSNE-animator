Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Love, love, love, love, love, love
Think I'm in (love, love)
Love, love, love, love, love, love
I'm in (love, love)
Love! (Love, love)
Love, love
Love! (Love, love)
Think I'm in (love, love)
Love! (Love, love)
Love, love
Love! (Love, love)
Love, love (I'm free!)

I was released just that morning
I'm standing there thinking "Freedom's boring"
Leaning against a telephone pole
That's when I seen her and lost control
She was in her car waiting at the light
She looked right at me and I thought that I might
Be in love. But then the shit turned green
She quickly took off! I ran in between
The cars behind her, screaming for help
Opened a car door and yanked the seatbelt
Off some fat kid and tossed his ass
Jumped in his pickup and mashed the gas
Caught up to my love, pulled along the side
She was looking kinda terrified
But I rammed her car, I gave her a nudge
I screamed, "PULL OVER! I THINK I'M IN LOVE!"

I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)

I was bagging groceries, out on parole
Ten hour shifts and they taking their toll
I glanced up for a look at the time
And there she was, two lanes from mine
My stomach fell like a roller coaster
I dropped my shit and started walking closer
Introduced myself, and gave her a hug
Went in for the kiss, but I got no love
She yanked away like she was offended
But I know true love and she's pretending
She ran outside to the parking lot
But I was on that ass, she was fucking hot
I spun her around and I licked her face
She screamed, hit me with a can of mace
Two guy outta nowhere knocked me out
As if I don't know what love's about

I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)

[Bitch talking about a stalker]

Love! (Getcha, getcha)
Love! Think I'm in
Love! (You know you want this)
Love! I'm in
Love! (Getcha, getcha)
Love! Think I'm in
Love! (You know you want this)
Love!

I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)

[Keep repeating "love"]
I...
Think I'm in
I...
I'm in
I...
Think I'm in
I...
I'm in

I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)
I'm telling you girl (I know this feeling)
I'm watching you (I'm coming closer)</pre>
