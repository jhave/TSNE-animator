Babyyy you ain't gotta front .. shorty cause I want you
Babyyy you ain't gotta front .. shorty cause I want you
Babyyy you ain't gotta front if you want me ..
Babyyy you ain't gotta front if you want me, shorty cause I want you
Babyyy you ain't gotta front if you want me
I could get down if you let me, shorty cause I want you
I've never shown you (oooh) shake it on me
Baby, you ain't gotta front if you want me
I could get down if you let me, shorty cause I want you
I've never shown you (oooh) shake it on me

[Pitbull]
Yeah, yeahh, yeahh, hahahaha, whooo! .. Hahaha, uhh
I'ma tell you my thoughts mami then you could tell me, uhh, whatchu think
We could discuss everythin you wanna do baby over these drinks
You could tell me how you want it, don't fight it
You could tell me how you like it, I'm Mr. However You Want It
B-b-b-j-j-j-jump on it, I ain't here to sell you dreams
or paint you some pretty pictures
I just wanna get in those jeans and just like a robbery lick ya
Baby you got me feelin crazy, don't worry 'bout these haters
Wait up, wait up, I got room keys, come see me later
We gon' fulfill fantasies so call your girls
Don't be mad at me, excuse me baby, I'm freaky girl
Sugar check this out..
This gon' be a night to remember I can tell by the way you shake it on me

[Chorus: Oobie]
Baby, you ain't gotta front if you want me
I could get down if you let me, shorty cause I want you
I've never shown you (oooh, shake it on me)

[Pitbull]
Now I'm, feelin, a little, whoozy
It's like the, room, spinnin, and movin
I feel her, body, next to, mine
I'm so, fucked up, it's like I'm, blind 
All I feel is her rubbin my back, I'm lovin that
I'm so caught up in the moment, ain't no holdin back, never that
Mami ain't on E but I got her eyes rollin back (hahaha)
Mami it's all on me, let me show you how to play wit that
Now please, let me, show you how freaks tempt me
I know that, you're a, freak it's just discrete
Sugar check this out..
This gon' be a night to remember I can tell by the way you shake it on me

[Chorus] - 2X
