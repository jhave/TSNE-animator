Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You're one nasty girl, you're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl,

I can see that you like to be sexy, sexy
I can see that you like that you nasty girl
I can see that you like to be sexy, sexy
I can see that you like that you nasty girl
You're one nasty girl

Tonight I'm the director let me tell you how to move
Lights, camera, action let me enjoy the view
You don't gotta worry I'll make sure you're on cute
If you pay attention then you know just what to do
You, take my light eyes, you take my sexy thighs, do it we can get to know each other at my table
Do what you wanna do, what you wanna do
It's turning me on, you're touching like a nasty girl

You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl,

I can see that you like to be sexy, sexy
I can see that you like that you nasty girl
I can see that you like to be sexy, sexy
I can see that you like that you nasty girl
You're one nasty girl

You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're one nasty girl.

I can see that you like to be sexy, sexy
I can see that you like that you nasty girl
I can see that you like to be sexy, sexy
I can see that you like that you nasty girl
You're one nasty girl

I'm the kind of girl to bring them boys to the back
We'll be popping bottles open up and say hot
Lighten up the club cause there's been another sound
Everybody want it but they don't got it like I

You, take my light eyes, you take my sexy thighs, do it we can get to know each other at my table
Do what you wanna do, what you wanna do
As long as I can keep my eyes on you enjoy your lady

You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're one nasty girl

I can see that you like to be sexy, sexy
I can see that you like that you nasty girl
I can see that you like to be sexy, sexy
I can see that you like that you nasty girl
You're one nasty girl,

Cause I'm a nasty girl
They wanna take me home cause they know I won't say no
I'm such a free show, I'm such a free show

You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're one nasty girl.

You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you a nasty girl, nasty
You're one nasty girl, you're one nasty girl</pre>
