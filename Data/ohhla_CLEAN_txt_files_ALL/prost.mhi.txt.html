[ VERSE 1 ]
She's a price-tag prostitute, so I got to shoot
And if my game is right, man, then I can knock her boots
Because to me a girlfriend is of past tense
They fucked me good, and broke me for my last cents
I was a lemon treatin tramps like women
Never understood the reason why I couldn't go in em
See, a hoe will think twice before she choose on me
Cause all I offer is my dick and my r-a-p
But you new boys are simpin, thinkin you're pimpin
Wouldn't have a hoe stroll if you were starvin and limpin
All you're doin is pollutin and extortin the game
So you sell cocaine because you have no name
It's the Franklin, Grants and the Jacksons
Bitches at your door, rich dude givin you action
So you kick em down one, two, three, four hundred
And when I saw you with the broad, boy, you sure fronted
Loud talker like a father figure
But any punk can play her father if his pocket's bigger
And you hoes get treated like a child again
You don't work or go to school 
And get beat when you act a fool
Go home to dada 
255 pounds for you gladly 
You know you hate the sight of him
Damn, but you'se a tramp and if he pays you good, you might love him
Don't you have any self-respect?
Is the dollar that mighty that you trade him sex?
Well tell me, what does that price include?
Will you suck me and fuck me and dance in the nude?
Well now you got me trippin, baby
I could buy a freak, toss her up, and call her my lady?
Well that sounds pretty damn reasonable
I'll just pay her, if that's all that's pleasin the hoe
Everything I pay her she wants to screw
Now what would you call this girl? A prostitute

[ VERSE 2 ]
Check it out, I got a prospect, so I'ma test her
Showed my money, and played the hoe like Uncle Fester
Make her think that I'm her sugar daddy
She can lick me cause I'm full of candy
Man, I got her bitin, she thinks she found herself a sucker
But I'ma price her and see how much it is to fuck her
And if she got a cheap price range
Cool, then I ain't gotta buy her nice things
You see, her values are low, her self-respect is minimal
30 dollars is a steal, makes me feel like a criminal
10 for the movies, 20 for an entree 
Take her to the house and tossed her up the sautee
Strip her, then I flip her on her tummy first
Yeah, you know I gotta get my money's worth
You see, the rule of the game is, you pay to play
See, I call her up, and it's cool for me anyday
All there is is an initiation fee
Buy her one time, then the rest of it is free
But a sucker-punk mark keeps payin the freak
Got sprung on the pussy cause his game was weak
You better hope you can afford the hoe
Cause if you miss a month of rent, she'll be out the do'
Lookin for the highest bidder that wants to get with her
Punks lease her with an option to buy, but I rent her
30 dollars and I made you sin?
It was cool for a night, now I'ma trade you in
And let me tell you about the trade-in policy
You trade a freak in to get a woman with quality
One with values and high standards
Not a freak with no fuckin manners
I need more than a piece of meat
Most freaks can only fuck, beg, eat and sleep
What does that sound like to you?
Well for the right price, partner, you got yourself a prostitute

[ VERSE 3 ]
There's a fine line between a girlfriend and a prostitute
And you're a trick, you thought she loved you, but it's not the truth
It's always odd when you're fuckin your lady
That you always seem to fuck her on payday
So when you're 200 short, you never trip
A good fuck and "I love you" is some bullshit
It's a routine, not a new thing, every paycheck
She was bitchin last night, now she's alright
You never tripped on her attitude adjustment
On payday she be callin you her husband
I got a plead with my homies
Because when I was broke a lotta bitches didn't know me
Shit like this occurs cause punks like you
Give em money, pay they rent, buy they clothes and buy they food
The hoes get spoiled and sprung on the treatment
If you step to her broke, then you're turned down frequent
Yeah, you got your high-siders in the drop coupes
Let her ride front seat, then you knock boots
Girls try to play real sweet and innocent
But what they really want is salary and benefits
Damn, I ain't sayin I'm a stingy miser
But if you play me like a punk, you'll be layin in kaiser
Usin sex as a bargainin tool
So you can get my credit cards and charge em up, fool
Hoes posin as girlfriends tryin to get over on me
Playin herself just like a tramp, I do her like Rover and gee
Now I got another victim, so let me get a quick one
My pants on one leg when I pound and never kiss em
Shit, you wanna act like a hoe, then be a real one
I'ma treat you like you are and make you feel dumb
When I'm poundin I'ma yank it out 
Shove you in your ass, make you fall on your face so you think about
How cheap and sleazy and trampy and stragglin you really are
For some money or to ride in someone's silly car
Don't you feel like a jackass?
Man, on your hands and knees that fast
A little dinner and a movie is a joke
Cause when it's over, you're still goin home broke
Now to all the homeboys, let me ask you somethin
How many of y'all know you got a real woman?
Try to analyze and think practical
Cause if she's sellin you her sex, then you smack the hoe
And stop callin her your girlfriend
And treat her like she wants you to
Just like a prostitute</pre>
