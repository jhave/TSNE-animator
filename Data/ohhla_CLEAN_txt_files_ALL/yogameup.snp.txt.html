[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah Man What's Going on Man It's really really pimpin' up in here man
I know you ain't seen pimpin' in a long time man, I've been MIA
You know what I'm sayin' missin in action
I ain't been on no milk carton box
But I've been milking and boxing these bitches
'Cause they got to step they game up, you know what I mean

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg] + (Lil Jon)
What you lookin' at (step yo game up!)
What you waitin' for (step yo game up!)
Go on come on in the door (step yo game up!)
Drop it to the floor and just (step yo game up!)
You a kid (step yo game up!)
You drink gin (step yo game up!)
Is that your friend (step yo game up!)
Tell a nigga you with you better (step yo game up!)

[Lil Jon]
Break it down bitch, let me see you back it up
drop that ass down low then pick that motherfucker up [x2]
Back that pussy she's a motherfucker [x4]
Rub that shit it's yours bitch, grab his dick it's yours bitch [x2]
Now turn around bitch, put that ass on a nigga
Grind on his dick make it get a little bigger [x2]

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Bitch wanna act like she ain't never been with fast lane pimpin' om 'em
Nails with the French tip potato chip yup with a French dip
Say she wanna French kiss all on my diz-nick
It's cool, go on and break fool if you have to
What which you won't do bitch I'ma slap you
Stay in line ho it's a pimp affair
If you down to get low I can take you there
But you can't fake once you hit the gate
Shake till it ache, work that birthday cake
You say you wanna make it ho
Well quit bullshittin' and get naked hoe
Now you always got to be hot and vicious
So move them biscuits and hit them tricks bitch
Now you got about a minute to fix this
Cuz I'm trying to find a bitch that's bootylicious

[Chorus]

[Trina]
P-U-S-S-Y, run a world, I'm the girl in the flesh ah
Lookin' for a nigga that will suck me like a blow pop
Run that dick to the door, do me baby don't stop
Same nigga talkin' all that shit
Just a little bitch, little balls, little dick
Let me show you how to work your tongue like a hurricane
We ain't here to play no games, baby give me everything
I know you like me when I drop it down low
Show it from the back, look back, let it roll
Drop it to the floor like a g-bitch supposed to
Shake it shake it shake it make a nigga go postal
But that's for fucking with a Miami girl
Get your man, take his money, and then buy the world
So nigga don't front, cuz fat wallets and big dicks is all I want

[Chorus]

[Lil Jon]
Chuuuch, Breach, Tabernacle [x8]
