[Puba]
Yeah.. aight..
2000 representatives comin to ya
Yeah, here to talk about a situation you know
that makes the world go round, check it
It's on that love and hate tape, yaknahmsayin?
Be damned if you do, damned if you don't
But I'ma rap on it a taste, yaknahmsayin?
I'ma let honey take it away, check it

	[Valdes]
	It's a thin line..
	between love and hate
It's a thin line (yeah) it's a thin line (uhh)
	If you feel the vibe..
Yeah.. no doubt
	It's time to set em straight

[Puba]	[Valdes]
No doubt, check it
Well it's four o'clock, in the mornin
Just gettin in, baby love's askin
	Baby where you been?
Tryin to get mine
	But I've been sittin waitin all this time
I got to grab this cream, while I got the chance
Romance, without finance -- you know the rest, baby
	It's just a nuisance
I'm sayin, act like you know
Nuttin can't grow if the dough don't flow
	But I'm just tryin to get a-wit you
Baby I ain't tryin to bullshit you
Why we gotta beef on the same old shit?
	Because your friends you'd rather be with
But when I'm with my friends, I don't go through that
So you can pack your bags
	They already packed
Well you ain't really my skin
	And your friends ain't really your friends

Chorus: repeat 2X

	They smile, in your face
	All the time, they wanna take your place
	The back-stabbers
	Pocket-grabbers

[Puba]
I told my man that I gave my girl the outs
Crib to the head, king size bed
That love shit is dead, so let's call some chickenheads
Tell em do the spread while we bein handfed
We had it goin for the first two weeks
I bumped into my ex, and she asked, could we speak?
I told her made it quick, and this is what she kicked
Dig it

	[Valdes]
	Hey baby how you doin?
Fine
	I heard that you and your friends be havin good times
No doubt, he come through in the clutch
	That nigga ain't really your friend
What?
	I wish you wouldn't trust him so much
You got a problem?
	I think you really trust him too much
Cause he's the best friend, I got
	No he's not!
	The last time you went out of town
Yeah?
	Guess who came creepin around?
Yeah..
Whatchu sayin?
	He started sayin that you're no good for me
	But all that drama wasn't tryin to see
	Talkin bout all the other girls you got
Oh the nigga went out like that?  Oh shit!
	Steppin to me, tryin to blow up the spot
	Tell me boy, is that your friend
	Nooooo, nooooooo, noooooo
Damn
	It's a thin line, between love and hate
Love and hate, love and hate
	If you feel the vibe boy, it's time to set him straight
Oh I'ma set that nigga straight
	It's a thin line boy, between love and hate
	If you take your time, it'll be worth your wait

[Puba]
Boy I tell you these days
You don't even know who to trust, yaknahmsayin?
That's how love do, that's how hate do, knahmsayin?
It's all connected
It's all injected, knahmsayin?</pre>
