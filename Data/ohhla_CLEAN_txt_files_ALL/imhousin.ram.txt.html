[Zack de la Rocha]
Coolin' on the scene like a horse in a stable
A brother got ill, and tried to snatch a fat cable
I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing
I punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring
I had an ace in the hole when it came to that
Yo Z, you was packin? You know I was strapped
Posse kept rollin' it was hard to get with 'em
So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim
They kept coming, just like I figured
So I stepped back, and started sprayin' niggaz
What a way to go out, out like a sucker
But I'm on track, like a Long Island train
That can head up your mission, suckers who be dissin'
Always on my jock like a snake always hissing
Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross
Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast
Givin best wishes to the best MC
And when the spot is blown and yo you know it's me
Because I'm HOUSIN!! [Housin....housin'...]
'Cause I'm HOUSIN!! [Housin....housin'...]
Because I'm HOUSIN!! [Housin....housin'...]
'Cause I'm HOUSIN!! [Housin....housin'...]
Because I'm Housin'!

[Hook]
Because I'm Housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm Housin
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm Housin
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm Housin
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

Coolin' at a party, no better yet disco
Head feelin' mellow from a bottle of Cisco
MOVE..
To crush and fry a Sucker MC like Crisco
Gimme the cue, check one two
Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo
You treatin' me the Z to the D, like a stepchild
Let me tell you homeboy you're livin' foul
MC's, you know who you are
On the bandwagon, why Z? Cuz you a star
This is the year when the joker's are wild
When a fag can't hack it and try to bite your style
I get hip to the scheme, before it happens
If it gets wild, then I start cappin
But for now, since everything's calm
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Because I'm HOUSIN!! [Housin....housin'...]
'Cause I'm HOUSIN!! [Housin....housin'...]
'Cause I'm HOUSIN!! [Housin....housin'...]
'Cause I'm HOUSIN!! [Housin....housin'...]
Because I'm Housin'

C'MON!

[Hook]
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm Housin
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm Housin
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Because I'm Housin
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

Because I'm Housin

[*guitar riff*]

Hook 2:
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('cause I'm Housin!)
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('cause I'm Housin!)
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('cause I'm Housin!)
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('cause I'm Housin!)
'Cause I'm HOUSIN!! [Housin....housin'...]
'Cause I'm HOUSIN!! [Housin....housin'...]
