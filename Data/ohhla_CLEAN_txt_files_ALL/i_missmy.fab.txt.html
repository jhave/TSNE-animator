[Intro - Fabolous - talking]
I mean, I don't even know where to start like
It's like you find love, you lose love and then

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Met her up town on Dykeman, aight then, light skinned
Starin with a slight grin, I don't know, might been
'Cause I'm in this white Benz (*honk honk*)
Or the way the ice in the Breitling, flash brighter than the lightning
But I knew from right then
She was 'bout her money and how she fit right in
Knowin how I might spend
To make a story short, other than the tight end
Had a Washington Heights friend, who bring that white in
Set up a meeting, her dude caught a flight in
Sat down at Sole, popped a bottle of white then
Got straight to business like two corporate white men
The food came, before I could take a bite in
He said "you the type I usually don't invite in
But since we got a like friend, I could get you like ten" (ten?)
I told him I could move like ten by night's end
Put the white over the plate like I'm throwin strikes in
El Duque, got a dude in the UK, buy five bricks at a time, 22K
He send the Euros, I send the pure dough
Now that's the real meaning of a foreign exchange
He smiled, then finished his glass of wine
There's a van outside, pull your S-Class behind
My man'll pass a dime, at one five a pop
Tell shorty "make the drop, don't make no stops"
I gave him a hand shake, some dollars for the tab
Gave shorty the location then I hollered for a cab
I hit Mike told 'em "send the wire to the buyers"
Word got 'round like we was passin out flyers
And them things went as quick as they came
I'm back bein a hustler, this chick is to blame
I said them things went as quick as they came
I'm back bein a hustler, this chick is to blame

[Break - Female Voice - talking] - w/ ad libs
I miss you baby
I'll never do anything to hurt you

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
Twelve months in, turned a Benz to a Lambo
Everywhere the fam go, corks fly, cham' flow
I gotta celebrate (hey!), that's the way I am yo
In the past week I watched fifty thousand grams go
Pocket full of money, army full of Rambos
Trunk full of bricks, hand guns full of ammo
Even got detectives if somethin goes wrong
The money's so strong, they see it from my perspective
But with my shorty, a nigga so protective
And should be, she the one who know where the connect live
She don't talk much, real calm and collective
Seen somethin in me 'cause shorty's very selective
I tell her fall back, shorty still'll drive
She said the rush of the risk just make her feel alive
I listen at her fuss, sayin that I must
Let her do it 'cause it ain't too many niggaz that I trust
So now time is flyin, I've been kind of eyein
A ring for my queen, who got me diamond buyin
I'm in the G.T., headed up to CT
Lookin for a stone, light her finger like E.T.
I got there, got a call from a DT
Sounded nervous (what's up?) sayin "we need to talk now"
(What are you doin right now?)
I told 'em "chill out, I ain't in New York now
Any problems I got, get traced in chalk now
But when I get back, we can meet and chit chat
Better not be no bullshit, I ain't even with that"
Now back to what a nigga came out here for
This five carat diamond without near flaw
Then head back to the city, call up the committee
Get ready for tomorrow, they comin in with fifty
I almost forgot, I gotta stop and see a cop
I figured it was a drop, who must ain't get his gwap
Told 'em meet me by the bridge, I get there in a hurry
Got me worried and it's probably just a minor mix up
He said "nah Los', Feds done snatched ya chick up
Caught her at a pick up, scoopin them bricks up
She gon' cooperate and a fix up
Probably at the headquarters now hangin flicks up"
I asked him "Was he sure?" Shorty's mi amor
This happened to me before with my man Diador, over a ki of raw
My nigga got killed, caps got peeled and I still got guilt
He assured me, I was hot, she had put 'em on me
Swore to Jesus' peers that he was here to warn me
Normally, I would have just ended her life
But this was the girl that I intended to wife
So I went home to shorty, had trouble sleepin
Shorty kind of peepin, my sudden discomfort
She woke up mad early, so I got up with her
Got dressed and told her I would hit the spot up with her
She wanted to go alone but a nigga insisted
Like "baby it's been a while and truthfully I missed it"
We rode out but she don't know that I done made a plan
When she hit the spot, close shot, see you later man
I watched her in the building
Knowin it's the last time, seein her ass climb in and out of the car
Yo I even thought about gettin out of the car
But sat back, lookin at the ring about to be yours
I let one tear fall at an unfair call
Ya whole life can change in just one year y'all
Caught in a thought, then I heard a (*gunshot*)
Hi love, bye love, I will miss my love

[Outro - Fabolous - talking] (Female Voice) - w/ ad libs
(I miss you baby)
It's so crazy how it happened like
You know
(I will never do anything to hurt you)
It's just
It's crazy
It's just crazy you know?
It's just the way it happened it's just
One thing
Ain't no love in this shit
Ain't no love in this game
There's no love</pre>
