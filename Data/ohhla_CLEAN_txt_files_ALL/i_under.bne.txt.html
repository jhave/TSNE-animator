Shit- heh, friends- heh
A friends come and go I done learned that shit
Either through death or money issues
Or you know what I mean just time and space
Family sometimes you the biggest enemies man
Heh shit

Those that love me if you leave me
I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I'm a go get strong, return a better man

You better believe it you see me
How we creeped up out of Cleveland get your money baby
If not I'm gonna break even I won't let you play me
Your game ain't even season
It's that thuggish ruggish Bone I hope you know
Little B the reason see you creepin baby
But what are you really seekin
Are you weak, don't believe in me, believe in Jesus
I'm a freak, but baby that's for life
And all the weak I'm goin deep, and I can roll deeper than you
Half breed rock the mics to survive
And I might not make it out alive I'm spittin to save my life
Tryin a make it right welcome to the world that we live
And all that I did was crawl up out the stuff for my kids
So rest in peace to Little Eazy
But your paper work was sleazy and the black widow was horny
Baby was gettin greedy my boys is 'posed to be watching my back
Load up the guns and let's attack
But ain't nobody tryin to feel me with stack
For my baby's

Those that love me if you leave me
I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I'm a go get strong, return a better man
Those that love me if you leave me
I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I've returned, I've returned

Better bring my money baby nobody is gonna stop me
I'll fill 'em up with that hot shit
Bullets all in your body better watch me wicked posse
Yeah, automatic shotguns half of these rappers talkin
Ain't none of 'em ever popped one
Little kid from South View who would've thought that I'd make it
And the people ain't behind me my family's kinda freakish
That thuggish ruggish, nigga from Columbus
And this is the way we play spread your rumors
I just love it do it all day everyday
Ride to the rythme of the nickel put the pen in the pack now
And I know you fear me, I done been there
Done that, run that, fun that covered around
And let me kill 'em with the venom we killin 'em with the sound
Every city, every little bitty town
Everybody wanna break me down
Nobody gonna take me down East 99 has been abandoned
Cleveland they show me love, they still wonderin how
I made it up outta the famine better believe it baby, baby
Should a listened to my people, still runnin from demons and evil
War

Those that love me if you leave me
I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I'm a go get strong, return a better man
Those that love me if you leave me
I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I've returned, I've returned

I'm sick of the drama, sick of havin beef with my momma
And beef with my sisters my brother got murdered
Over marijuana bless the bewilders
Strugglin, hustlin all of my life, watching my back
They already tried to murder me twice
I smoke the herb that I like, I never done coke in my life
We buy but I lie if I did it I'd tell entertainment tonight
Ain't no slackin in my rack it ain't no shame in the game
It ain't no slippin and the pimpin ain't no crack on the brain
You gotta be jealous of me and my fellas
Ain't that what they tell us sell us anything
We helpless give me a little bit faq and help us
We strugglin, jugglin, thugglin, hustlin, thuggin up in the club
No one to talk to, you step on his shoes
You really fucked up, poppa you was a roller
But his pockets are all swollen, you met the dope man
And now we on the block ask who told 'em
Sell 'em  some soap man that's for all the times you played me
Old man this is your son with a blunt and a gun
Check out my slow jam

Those that love me if you leave me
I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I'm a go get strong, return a better man
Those that love me if you leave me
I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I've returned, I've returned</pre>
