Make ya,and Shake yo shit (woo Lord)
I am puttin poetry into motion my addiction is overdosing from a natural high

Supplyin the soul with that unmistakinable mystical magical feelin that your money can't buy
Becomin a slave to the rhythm there's no way that you could stop me now I'd like to see you try
Because I'm already long gone don't be scared for me baby just blow me a kiss good bye
I can't believe you'd rather stay behind then go beyond talk to me baby tell me why
Society won't set ya free now follow me programmin' your fear to fly
Best believe I'm a breathe and break ground before I die
I know it's live and let live but my love won't let me lie
Make me wanna do the

And we don't speak proper english when we walk we strut our stuff
We act like life is gravy even though it's oh so rough
My doctor diagnosed me and he said now here's the deal
You're coming down with a bad case of

The Crooked Booty (come on, everybody)
The Crooked Booty (I can't hear y'all)
Now everybody do the crooked booty,
Come on, I say the crooked booty (come on)
Come on everbody I say the crooked booty
Yeah, the crooked booty
Now everybody do the crooked booty
Yeah, come on, the crooked booty

Oh doctor doctor help me please 
I got this problem come over me
And I just can't shake it (I just can't seem to shake this thing off up me, now help me)
At first I was just fine 
Didn't really play it no mind
Until it hit another time (another time)
Cuz my chest popped out (my chest popped out)
And my back went in (I said my back went in)
Started movin my body
Like I had a nervous itch (ooow)
So the doctor gave me (say what?)
This remedy (what'd he say?)
He said, "Pop it to boy"
And feel the beat

It's the brand new craze
And it's comin your way
It was started in the slums
By the Dungeon Family
It's not very hard it's kinda easy to do
All you got to be is poor and broke and have no loot
It's called the Crooked Booty when it's only a test
It's like tryin to stop the IRS from takin your cheques
It's like tryin to soak your cheese and took all the rap
It's like tryin to stop a nigga from crackin your back on this track
It's like tryin to tell your daughter you can't chase the cake
It's like tryin to stop a boss jack from swangin his set
You just go like that (it don't matter)
You can be 400 pounds or be as tall as Shaq (come on)
Pimp get out your llac
And do the crooked booty
And do the crooked booty
Do the crooked booty do the crooked booty do the crooked booty (aaaaaaaaaaah)

Now everybody do The Crooked Booty (Everybody, come on)
The Crooked Booty (I can't hear y'all)
Now everybody do the crooked booty (a little louder)
Come on, I say the crooked booty (People in the back)
Come on everbody I say the crooked booty (People on the side)
Yeah, the crooked booty
Now everybody do the crooked booty (Yeah, y'all got it)
Yeah, come on, the crooked booty (A little louder y'all)

I ain't got no paper
I can't wipe my ass
But give me one lil' dollar
I'll show you how to make it last
I ain't got no paper
I can't wipe my ass
But give me one lil' dollar
I'll show you how to make it last (I'll show you how to)

And we don't speak proper english when we walk we strut our stuff
We act like life is gravy even though it's oh so rough
My doctor diagnosed me and he said now here's the deal
You're coming down with a bad case of the 

The Crooked Booty 
The Crooked Booty (A little louder now)
Now everybody do the crooked booty (do it like you can't do it no more)
Come on, I say the crooked booty
Come on, I say the crooked booty
Yeah, everybody do the crooked booty
Now everybody do the crooked booty

Now everybody do the crooked booty (yeah, everybody)
