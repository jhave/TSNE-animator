[Intro] + (Iyaz)
New Boyz! (Geah gal!)
(Well tell dem wussy boy)
(I-Y-A-Z be longside them one New Boyz)

[Chorus: Iyaz]
She make me wanna break my bank (my bank)
Give everything I got (got) just to get a shot (shot)
Make it rain (it rain)
Where my money at? Where my money at?
Break my bank (my bank)
Forget about the tag (tag) throw it in the bag (bag)
Make it rain (it rain)
Shawty wanna break my, shawty wanna break my bank

[Verse One]
Damn - girl! You look better than the videos
Think I wanna break my bank, hammer to the piggy though
All-all the groupie girls gettin jealous of what I spend
They tryin to chop it up, but I ain't The Karate Kid
Jaded! Everyday I'm spendin more on her
I don't buy shit, like I barely hold the door open
Every time I say this shit I always get her one more
When it's time for taxes a nigga gon' be done for

[Chorus]

[Iyaz]
Make me wanna break my
Make me wanna break my bank

[Verse Two]
Okay, the start of my day, I took her on a date
Had to scrape for some change so I went to the bank
But when I seen her she was so damn fine like that
So I headed right back to pull a lot more stacks
Overdrawn, low funds, it's-it's like I'm dumb
But I'll put it right back 'cause your boy is sprung
Man she is so damn fine got me spendin all this cash
Man it's goin too fast, I need to watch my ass

[Iyaz]
Make me wanna break my
Make me wanna break my bank

[Verse Three]
If you a bad girl, and you need a little change
Tell your man go break his bank (go break yo' bank!)
If you a bad girl, and you tryin to get paid
Tell your man go break his bank (go-go break yo' bank!)
If you a bad girl, and you need a little change
Tell your man go break his bank (go break yo' bank!)
If you a bad girl, and you tryin to get paid
Tell your man go break his bank (go-go break yo' bank!)

[Chorus]

[Iyaz]
Make me wanna break my
Make me wanna break my bank</pre>
