[Intro]
I'm sure glad you guys could make it tonight

[Verse One] [Guru]
Possibly
Nigga, you might try stoppin' me
But obviously
Boy, you ain't thinkin' properly
My philosophy
Is to keep the shit poppin' B
Showin' you stupid fuckers, how true hip hop should be
It's costed me
Sleepless nights, keepin' shit tight
Peepin' the madness, saddens me deeply, aight?
Gentrification
A new prison administration
Of a black man's struggle
I'm the livin' interpretation
This is my emancipation
Word to Zulu Nation
Still got chicks waitin' all sick and impatient
Now-a-days they all got game
All want fame
They all complain
So all I want is some brain
And to you industry sucker
Your girl she had some bomb shit I stuck her
You don't like it so I guess we got conflict

[Guy talking]
And let me tell you one thing

"Y'all want problems, pursuit it, let's do it" - Mobb Deep 'Quiet Storm (Remix)'

[Verse Two] [Masta Ace]
You can catch me shootin' dice in a dark alley
Rockin' Clarks and Ballies
Lot of niggas askin' me, how did I spark Cali?
Cats on my block, they stay wildin'
They stay gettin' thrown on the Island and cellular phone dialin'
Niggas walkin' round with gold teeth and old beef
It's no wonder why niggas lives is so brief
Lot of cats tryin' extortion, lie in a coffin
Got they moms thinkin' 'bout 'em
Cryin' and coughin'
It's conflict

[Chorus] [Masta Ace]
Conflict
Look, the drama is on, word born, if you look at me wrong
We got
Conflict
If you walkin' the streets or if in you in the club talkin' to freaks
We got
Conflict
I got a hit list and your name is on it
"But you don't want it" - Mobb Deep 'Shook One's Part II'
Conflict 
"You ain't got no shit for me"

[Verse Three] [Guru]
It's conflict
Souls at war
Forces at war
Countries at war
That's why that niggas dumpin' the four
Pumpin' the raw
Chumpin' the law
Uh huh, a ghetto superstar with fly cars
Now he's slumped by the door
Life gone
And now we lost another icon
Should he have squashed the beef and let the bygones be bygones?
Can't be weak in these streets
Gotta stay on some strong shit
A lot of niggas wanna rep
That's why there's conflict

[Masta Ace]
When I splash on these tracks like belly flops it barely stops
I knocks niggas out of the box like skelly tops
Niggas know
Spittin' this fire is the status quo
The baddest flow
I do it for free but I'm glad it's doe
My flows melt the wax like candles
Can you handle?
When I shoot you in your foot
Turn your Timberlands into sandals
And that's word to Bald Head Slick and my nigga Strick
You sick
If you thinkin' you wantin' this conflict nigga

[Chorus] [Masta Ace]
Conflict
Look, the drama is on, word born, if you look at me wrong
We got
Conflict
If you walkin' the streets or if in you in the club talkin' to freaks
We got
Conflict
I got a hit list and your name is on it
"But you don't want it" - Mobb Deep 'Shook One's Part II'
Conflict 
"You ain't got no shit for me"

[Outro] [Guru talking]
Every single day and night around the world there's conflict. Word up
Just gotta rise about it. Hehe, yeah. YouknowhatImsayin'? 
Only the strong what? (Survive nigga. Survive) It's the Illkid
AKA Bald Head Slick (what?) AKA The 7-21-18-21 (What?) 
You know the rest. Up in here with no other than the Masta A-C-E I-N-E.
We got Joey T in the house DJ Jay-Ef aight. (Whoa) Straight like did-at
Conflict (Conflict) conflict (Conflict what? Conflict, conflict, conflict.) 
"They never fuck with us again."</pre>
