  Let's get wild
  Yeah, Master Ace in the house
  The whole Action Posse's in the house
  Ice-U-Rock's in the house, DJ Marley Marl's in the house
  Steady Pace is in the house, and we gonna do it like this

So many New Jacks and Jills on the hill
But only one bucket, so fuck it, they get the dills
Cause you no frills, that means your name ain't household
Now watch that little mouse fold
You can't take the pressure from the cooker
Stood there looking soft, so I started hooking off
And took her, I know she used to be yours
Now she's riding on the bus with us and doing tours
Along with some other little runts
We call her a fall girl, she does so many stunts
And then she got liver, she did it with the guy that drives the bus
Now she's a screw driver
Master Ace is flipping
Your grip is slipping, it's time I start stripping
Young ladies and the titles that hold 'em
I treat 'em like a pretzel: bend, stretch, and fold 'em
And I can do the same damage on stage
Black, white, or beige, you're gonna feel the rage
The same way the sluts with the big butts felt it
I'm not a dealer but I dealt it
So if you plan on riffing when I spank ya
Be prepared to grab your ankles because

	(Ace is wild!) No, not really
	(Ace is wild!) Come on, you're acting silly
	(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just chilling
	(Ace is wild!) Come on, stop illing

For whom the bell tolls, it tolls for all of those
Who lost out, cause I was at the polls
And I saw the results as they came in
So many wild-ass ones that need taming
But I hold a whip and a chair
And I don't play fair, so you'd better stay there
Until I say "Jump through the fire"
But I won't get burned, I learned to admire
&gt;From way across the room first
And after I study, buddy, that's when I kick a verse
That's high powered, you got devoured
By the jaws of death, you little coward
Scared to step in this arena
Where the grass is greener, you're looking meaner and meaner
But your look ain't scaring me away
So I just stay and say words to make your head sway
Capital A-C-E, boy
Serving the masses, you'd better take some classes
If you want to hang with this here
And if you get near, I'll eat you like a pear (Crunch)
But I don't really eat a lot of fruit
So say "ahh" (Mmmmmmph!) Now don't you look cute?

	(Ace is wild!) Nah, no I'm not
	(Ace is wild!) I just like to bug a lot
	(Ace is wild!) Leave me alone
	(Ace is wild!) Turn up the microphone
	(Ace is wild!) Yeah...

Mr. Gangster, who you trying to kid?
Fake, flam, and fess and dress the way you did
This is a microphone war
You say you're well-known, but what are you known for?
A porno flick and a hard dick
And always bragging about the girls you stick
Title for king? Yo I don't compete for that
Paid your dues? Let me see a reciept for that
Somebody put you on yesterday
And you fess today, and that's just the way
A sucker is supposed to operate
Just turn on my mic and I'm straight
Now you fronting like you got a million G's
Just because you sold a couple of LP's
Now you walking around thinking you're the man
Cause you bought a little suit from Dapper Dan
But so what? You still ain't dapper
Holding the mic makes you look like a rapper
But you're just a sloppy copy cat
Front on me and I'm a hit you with a bat
Bottom of the nineth, two out, and I'm at the plate
And SMACK! Over the left field gate
That's where your head goes, you're Rudolph the Red Nosed
And you can't join in, you shouldn't have said those
Rhymes that sound so merrily merrily
Since you're soft like poundcake from Sarah Lee
I might cut a slice, then say "What a nice
Sucker to gobble up with beans and rice"
You fat little rat from the sewer
I eat you like a meal, pass you like maneuer
Put you in the garden where my flower grows
Then where's your power? Tell me where your power goes
Somebody does your dirty work for you
Throw up your hands like a man so I can floor you
And oh, if you pull a jammie
You can run from Brooklyn to Miami
&gt;From Miami to Nevada
You'd better have a lotta, I mean a whole knot of
Payola, cause I'm about to roll a
Mic like a cess joint, so brother here's a bowl of
Pride, now eat it up
Cause I get kind of wild when I heat it up

	(Ace is wild!) Nah, not really
	(Ace is wild!) Come on, you're acting silly
	(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just chilling
	(Ace is wild!) Yo yo yo, stop illing
	(Ace is wild!) No, I'm not
	(Ace is wild!) I feel kinda hot
	(Ace is wild!) But I'm not acting wild
	(Ace is wild!) You know that ain't my style
	(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just cooling
	(Ace is wild!) And also I'm ruling
	(Ace is wild!) I ain't messing with nobody
	(Ace is wild!) I just wanna have a party
	(Ace is wild!) No, no
	(Ace is wild!) Come on, yo
	(Ace is wild!) It's me and Marley Marl
	(Ace is wild!) And I'm the Music Man, y'all</pre>
