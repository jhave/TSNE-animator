[Intro]
From a nickel and dime ass nigga
to a top, top, top - (big rigga)

Check it 
Check it out, check it out, check it out, check it 
Check it out 
Check it out, check it out, check it out, check it 

[B-Legit]
It ain't a cell in this town that can hold me
And fuck the task force 'cause them suckas tried to fold me, scold me 
Told me if I move that they was blastin'
Got me to the station, hella questions they be askin'
Who's a big baller? Who supply your crew?
Who got them big birdies in the box, is it you? 
I never said a word, 'cause nigga I don't do so 
You fools got some questions, better ask the lawyer-ooso

[Kurupt]
I'm so international, and all about my cashional 
18 milly irrational, speak mice
What you want fool, dogg tell me what you need 
Bought a couple pints of Hennessey, an eighth of weed 
It seems time's gettin' shorter 
Time to elevate from nickels, dimes, dubs, to quarters 
Kurupt, B-Legit, and 40 Water
Niggaz oughta - get to swervin' 
Take a hit, hit the strip, then get to pervin' 

[E-40]
Uh squa uh, squab music, mob music 
Ride on a motherfucker and draw down on his ass in music 
The 213, the 41510 
Pull a hoe without a motherfuckin' tug of war 
40 Water, your playa partner 
Ever since the womb, I've been a tycoon
Actin' up (actin' up) 
Actin' tough (actin' tough) 
Actin' bad with all kinds of guns and stuff 

[Chorus] - X 2
From a nickel and dime ass nigga 
To a top hat ballin' big rigga
From a nickel and dime ass nigga 
To a top hat ballin' big rigga 

[Kurupt]
I got a half a ounce, and a 'four to bounce 
A half a brick to flip, large amount accounts 
Life as a young nigga with loot don't count 
Life as a young nigga with loot turned out 
You know it ain't nothin' to it but to do it 
Flow like fluid, you's included 
Pursue it, subdue it, and run through it 
Doin' what I do, it's hard to maintain my composure 
Ah man, they came through with the doja, it's on

[B-Legit]
The motherfuckin' County ain't the place for the savage 
A cock hound dank, smoke a nigga 'bout his cabbage 
But if I'm ever caught I'ma ride my shit 
Divorce my broad, but nigga keep my bitch 
Bury my mail in my momma backyard 
Steady poppin' cons to correctional guards 
They fucks with my crew 'cause they claim that we be trouble 
Them niggaz from the V to the H-I double 
I'm tryin' to get this party, tonight at this motel 
A gang of bitches there, some more on my voice mail 
Bathtub full of the ice and the fifths 
My homie K-1 rollin' blunts at the crib 
First I take a hit, strolls like a pimp 
The motherfuckin' savage with the million dollar limp 
Another big day for this timin' ass baller 
Hit the block, stock in my ninety fin Impala 
Let them pipes holla, I know I'm lookin' saucy 
Nineteen shots, sittin' next to my faulty 
Stash my notch, shake the spot and gets far 
Bitch, I'm a motherfuckin' rap star 

[Chorus] - X 2
From a nickel and dime ass nigga 
To a top hat ballin' big rigga
From a nickel and dime ass nigga 
To a top hat ballin' big rigga 

[E-40]
Open shop with a sixteenth of powder to a whole zip 
To a half ham, now I'm sittin' kilogram
Niggaz 'spect me to the upmost 'cause I'm highly spoken 'bout 
Niggaz love me 'cause they know I'ms 'bout my paper route 
I keeps my lawyers and my bail bondsmen paid
Shit, for all I know they might decide to raid shit 
Back in the day po-po was easily out-smarted 
But now they got some new and improved state of the art shit

[B-Legit]
Man, it's goin' down, am I livin' in the past?
This modern day slavery takin' toll on my ass 
You either take me in, or let this timer go 
Or if you got some charges nigga let this timer know 
I told you I'm a rapper, love to entertain 
Catch me on the stage with a mic spittin' game 
Legit's my name and you can even ask your daughter 
About Kurupt, B-Legit, and 40 Water 

[Chorus] - X 4
From a nickel and dime ass nigga 
To a top hat ballin' big rigga
From a nickel and dime ass nigga 
To a top hat ballin' big rigga</pre>
