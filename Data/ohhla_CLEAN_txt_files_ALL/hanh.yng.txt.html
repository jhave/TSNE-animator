[INTRO]
Ying Yang, we done done it again
and put it on the map like hahn!
......
Put it on the map like hahn!

[Chorus]
Think we aint crunk, they think we playin'
All around the world, is what they sayin'
[repeat 2x]
Hahn (Hahn)
[repeat 8x]

[Verse 1]
Took a pen and a paper, and we spit on some game
and flip the script, and got the world start screamin' our names
Ying Yang in this thang and its evident
(You dont really like us nigga?) You irrelevent
We brought hands to the game, and we takin over
mind control em',like a hypnotic potion
puff of smoke em',nigga we don't bluff, we rolls em'
curve ya stomach, you vomit on tha rollercoaster

[Verse 2]
We been around the globe, done seen the world
Now we still make jingles fo tha boyz and girlz
and they like when a nigga say hahn (hahn!)
Play a nigga song like hahn (hahn!)
Cause we keep comin wit tha shit ya like
I say you god dam right, you god dam right
Niggaz stay crunk like hahn (hahn!)
Nigga off the chain like hahn, Kane bring it back now (hahn!)

[Verse 3]
Niggaz in the club like (hahn!)
Bitches in the club like (hahn!)
We roll on dubs like (hahn!)
We straight throw it up like (hahn!)
Go slow like (hahn!)
Hit tha flo like (hahn!)
Ho, drop that shit to tha flo like (hahn!)
Pop it till' ya can't no mo like (hahn!)
Say them boyz is out of control (hahn!)
We gon' crank this bitch till' it flow

[Verse 4]
Say Hanh! (hanh!)
If you feel it motherfuckers say hahn! (hanh!)
If you dont give a fuck say hanh! (hanh!)
Aint no koolaid in yo cup say hanh! (hanh!)
Drank this motherfucker up like hanh! (hanh!)

We gon have a ball
And party like its Mardi Gra
Even if ya on the wall
Just clap ya hands
Ying Yang in this thang like hanh!

[Verse 5]
(suckyx23)
We was on Soul Train screamin hanh! (hanh!)
On 106 nd Park screaming hanh! (hanh!)
We was on Spring Bling screaming hanh! (hanh!)
We was on the bassment screaming hanh! (hanh!)
When we in yo city, we gon scream hanh! (hanh!)
When you aint wit us we still gon scream hanh! (hanh!)
All these years we gon scream hanh! (hanh!)
Even next year we still gon scream hanh! (hanh!)

[Verse 6]
When we take the description of the song
Just cuz we make it a jingle
That dont mean its a get along
See we make it like this
So you can learn it quicker
And find out why we concerned wit niggaz

The twins and we quicker a lil nigga
We quicker to drug nigga
We jump up on a stage nd kill a nigga
They wishin that the crowds would feel em nigga
The way  me and my mans and them nigga (x4)

[Verse 7]
Scream hanh! (hanh!)
Till you cant no more
After that start stomping da flo
Kinda like you got da holy ghost
Get crunk, start doin ya thang
Get up, start doin ya thang  (hanh!)

[Verse 8]
Think we aint crunk, they think we playin'
All around the world, is what they sayin'
[repeat 2x]
Hahn (Hahn)
[repeat 8x]

[Verse 9]
[DJ scramble] Ying Yang we done done it again
[DJ scramble]Put it on da map like hanh!

Think we aint crunk, they think we playin'
All around the world, is what they sayin'
