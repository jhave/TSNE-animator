[Chorus]
Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill
It's a muthafuckin barbeque for real
All these days already gone by
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Put a little gin in the punch
Grandma getting crunked, just fine
Nobody give a fuck
All these days already gone by
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time

[Verse 1]
The door's open, I might as well just stroll in
Got some Arnie Palmer in my pitcher: call it Nolan
Ryan, try it once and then you go there
I am hoping that we can kick it
Reminiscing only about the good times
I know there's moments
When you probably love me but you didn't wanna show it
Now I'm all around the globe
With everyone but you
I know you fuckin miss me
Chill and keep it cool! Never getting old mane
Grown, no Rogaine. Boy you play with all that food
You better eat the whole thing!
It's a family reunion, all the grandmas be moving
Running in 3-legged races people would cry if they losing
When I was 2, my fly was blue
When I was gone, my ice cream cone was a giant wand
When my, bike was all I was riding on
Jewelry from a Happy Meal, fuck it I was happy still

[Chorus]
Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill
It's a muthafuckin barbeque for real
All these days already gone by
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Put a little gin in the punch
Grandma getting crunked, just fine
Nobody give a fuck
All these days already gone by
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time

[Verse 2]
Come and, step inside the Electric Slide
Spraying squirt guns at you like it's pesticides
So why you buggin', lil man stop bugging...
I gotta, spend some time, with some friends of mine
Get away from everything, go and rest your mind
It's not nothing, lil man it's not nothing...
All my little cousins acting like some munchkins
Running in the trees and they're crying out their eyes
Have to rush em to the ER - maybe just a Band-Aid will do it
You can sing along please, let the band play the music
Always nice when you come back home
Your friends go up but then they come back grown
Nice to know that you're never alone
Family reunions whenever I'm home.

[Chorus]
Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill
It's a muthafuckin barbeque for real
All these days already gone by
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Put a little gin in the punch
Grandma getting crunked, just fine
Nobody give a fuck
All these days already gone by
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time</pre>
