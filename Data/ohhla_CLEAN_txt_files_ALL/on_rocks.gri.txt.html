Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I ain't no scholar, I don't write no books
I done spend my money on the last girl honey and she hates my guts
I paid my rent late, so my landlord's angry
And all this shit keeps piling up and tryin' to hang me

I give my lovin' on the run (on the run, on the run)
So don't you try to slow me down and walk around yeah
Sick of tryin' to strum along, wit' yo' love song
So leave me here to pour another drink on the rocks

[Chorus]
All of this will hold you
Down onto the ground until you're crawlin' on the gravel
Like a regular guy
Oh all of this will hold you, down onto the ground
Until you're drowning in your sorrows with a bottle of rye

[Verse 2]
I ain't got no savior, I ain't got no time
I know I'm stuck with a problem
That will come through and swallow up my last dime
All I wanted, was some peace and quiet
To take me out of here, before I start a riot
Lost my reason I done lost my way, I done sat here for hours
And heard all the songs that the jukebox plays
So keep your sunny days away from here
And I'll pour the liquor down and smile while I say

Life's been on the rocks, I've taken
My last shot at holding on to
Life's been on the rocks, I've taken
My last shot at holding on to

[Chorus]
All of this will hold you
Down onto the ground until you're crawlin' on the gravel
Like a regular guy
All, all of this will hold you, down onto the ground
Until you're drowning in your sorrows with a bottle of rye

Like a regular guy</pre>
