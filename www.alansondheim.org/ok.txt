Jonathan and Marjoram

Jonathan was driving, Marjoram (yes, that's her real name), was in the 
passenger seat. They were traveling through the port of Los Angeles. They 
were would-be terrorists. "Take a left here," Marjoram said. "We don't have 
much farther to go." The refineries were close by. Jonathan reached over, 
signaled left. http://www.asondheim.org/takingleft.mov He didn't want any 
trouble.

Marjoram was having second doubts. She replayed, over and over again, her 
childhood dream, walking down a wooden pier of some sort, looking left and 
right into the water. http://www.asondheim.org/takingstraight.mov There 
were beautiful sea-creatures, kelp, algal mats, of all sorts; the water 
was alive. 'Perhaps the world is, as it is meant to be,' she thought. 
'Perhaps we're making an error.' She dreamed herself into a better life, 
waiting and walking, there on the pier, happy children, innocent and 
unaware, running just ahead.



wallltz

bored with 2^a/2^b time, momentary turning towards waltz!
waltz? complex because so much rushes with that accented beat!
there's not much time to complete anything after it!
the swaying goes against the 2/2 of arms/legs for example!
there are no 3^a with bilateral symmetry!
any code can be re/produced by the binary!
binary groupings tend towards singing! even teental! yes even teental!
lumbering back and forth, swaying back and forth, retarding and catching
up hither and yon, moving and lumbering and changing those feet and those 
hands and those arms and those legs - everything gets its turn!
more simple than simple yet more complicated because compact!
just those two lagging beats, and that accent, tends towards heaviness!
the oom-pahpah! attacking the binary! problems with the digital!
zeroes ones and twos, ones twos and threes, twos threes and fours!
here here! there there!

Missive from 


This missive, having once been written and already destined for /dev/null, 
is written, once again, reinforcing the direction of the original, that 
the Net, our Net, as we know it, or as it is own, is not only ephemeral, 
but that our communality, communitas, so dependent upon it, might well 
disappear - replaced only as dreams, of alterities in other places, 
likewise dreamed. What might be cauterized, what finality, is nothing less 
than our own interiority: limbs become phantom limbs, voices become 
phantom voices, and the social matrix itself becomes figurative ectoplasm. 
Not only is this a real possibility; it is fundamental that our ordered 
socius tends towards the disorderly - addresses and url will disappear, 
permanently, and that communicable touch we take for grant will turn 
towards a state of unacknowledged, because uncommunicated, mourning. This 
may happen tonight; it may happen tomorrow; or a century from now - but it 
will happen. And with this happening, technology reverts as well towards 
the hyper-personal - out of touch with anything but those loops of 
secondary narcissism that carry, first and foremost, the effluvia of 
identity - the rest is nothing but cultural superstructure, dependent on 
capital, which may have collapsed as well. Or not collapsed - capital 
never collapses - but turned local, regional - a xenophobic capital like 
homeowner's associations, owing nothing anywhere - no international debt 
for example, which is alterity raised to an incandescent degree.

Equivalence, that primordial condition of the duplicated file, breaks: all 
typifications, standardizations, disappear, and no textual instantiation 
may be compared to any other. The condition is diasporic; only the 
diachronic remains as re/constructed memory, synchrony itself such a 
memory, useless, uncanny, the materiality of dreams, the dreamwork.

This will happen. All of this will happen. On one hand we witness again 
and again the fragility of the material-real, which is both inert and 
always already unique; on the other, equivalence and the Net are destined 
to cease as processes, becoming nothing than other disconnected, scattered 
artifacts. We should prepare for this. We should recognize this future as 
certain and (in)coherent within our present own. We shall not own it. We 
shall not recognize 'own.'

Abacus: The Pale


The abacus is generally divided into two sections - above and below the 
line. Below, each bead or token represents one unit. above, each token 
represents five units. Consider the units above indexical: the _position_ 
of the token represents either naught or five. But the units below are 
doubly coded: as ikonic, they not only represent one; they _are_ one. But 
in terms of position, the one is counted and accountable, or uncounted and 
unaccountable. Think on that.


text from Miami University (Ohio) performance tonight:

Once We begin we march to our deaths yes yes we do or or do we do we march 
to our death? Is our death collective? Universal? One or many? I'm sorry 
I'm much better at sound than visual. No wait I meant to say much better 
at ... not at writing ... I'm much better "not at writing." Wait, you have 
to see this. But I'm not so good "at thinking." How does one do something 
"at" writing or something "at" thinking? Excuse me, I'm cold; my clothes 
are lost in a suitcase somewhere outside Chicago.You're early, we're 
running tests here, although the performance won't be all that different. 
If you look for about ten minutes you'll have had enough and then you can 
leave and make room for the lines of people outside. Signed, "Henry 
Potter." "Man tries to climb so high and then He falls and falls ALAS" 
"Man likes to fire off his Thing ALAS" This is me playing a waltz. That 
was me stopping a waltz. This is Anja Schmidt. This is me and Sandy 
Baldwin discussing the phenomenological distinction between "analog and 
digital." This is me and Sandy Baldwin flying through the air across the 
river in New Jersey (from New York). "We can fly." I should tell you the 
performance won't be any different from what you're seeing now, honestly. 
I might be a bit more nervous, that's all. Graphics are graphics. Well, 
anyway these were done around the time of the scandal over the Abu Gharayb 
prison in Iraq. And some of the guards involved in that, they were from 
West Virginia. And this was produced near the area where the guards, some 
of them, were from. So it was natural for me to work with disturbed, torn 
bodies - here's another one - you might have already seen this last night 
- I'm supposed to start in six minutes but this is only forty seconds 
long! I've used up all my material! FUCK! Maybe you'd like to hear a kid 
screaming. This kid from West Virginia can do this! I can't. I don't know 
how he does it. His family "doesn't encourage him." You just can't get 
enough of screaming kids! Think positive, think MARTHA STEWART! (Have you 
seen Wednesday's The Apprentice? I had to show this stuff instead. I don't 
know who got kicked off. Pleas see me later and letme know.) - on the 
right, one of the major scenes of car wrecks in Orange County California. 
That curve sneaks up on you! Ok, me, age fourteen. I knew a girl. I "fell" 
for her. More of the West Virginia work. Somewhere between avatars and 
shamans and the torture at Abu Gharayb there lies a whole politics. I 
can't tell you the politicxs "but I can tell you this/" These figures were 
animated by using motion graphics - a motion graphic device - by messing 
with the mapping of the sensors that are placed on the body - rearranging 
them - just as figures are rearranged in torture - just as torture (and 
Merce Cunningham for another example) pays little attention to the natural 
attitudes of the body. So the body - with the motion sensor stuff - was 
divided and splayed and redivied and the result is a remapping back on to 
bodies that makes little sense but for a kind of emotional economy.... 
(TURN AWAY YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO SEE THIS BLUSH!) Instead of being 
introduced, think of this as an introduction: MY NAME IS ALAN SONDHEIM AND 
I AM NOT ON MY 
MEDICATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WWELL, hmm, that's 
enough of that... See, what happened, my baggage was lost by American 
Airlines (PLEASE KILL AMERICAN AIRLINES BURN THEM IN HELL 
HAHAHAHHAHAHHAHHHHHHHHHHHZ) and so I'm working without my 
PLENIPOTENTIARIES - part of what I'm doing, trying to control these images 
- so they make some sort of sense - at times they seem to take over, take 
control - I'm wll aware of the sexuality/politics of the images, I'm not 
imagining things...I'm spoiling things, this is the grand finale and it's 
hardly just started. Terrific, so much stuff to look at. I'll try and tell 
yo what's here - the antenna movie in the upper left - searching for 
places to set up low frequency radio antennas - they need to be away from 
civilization - in the wilderness away from power lines - the recordings 
you're hearing are fromm the radio somewhat modified - then the category 
of natural/industrial - two films going through my images trying to find 
those which fit (I think ) into oene or another - I've got two naturals 
running, gotta tkae one out - Let's listen to the kids. Okay it's like 
this, THE KIDS ARE OUR FUTURE> (hell, that's not me , that's the 
medications talking!) - well .... This is my partner and me being a happy 
family in Santa Ana Clifornia on a residency program going about our 
business and singging and dancing like any happy family there's also 
simulated sex of course but that's , ow I don't want to inerryot tg HELL 
interrupt the bowing...
Ok picture this... it's three in the morning and there's a huge explosin 
outside our loft in brooklyn and G comes runnin and in and says the water 
mains blown and sure enoughs o so we run out and watched it fill sthe 
subway and tear the street apart. Some of you saw this last night BUT NOT 
THE WHOLE THING.
well I'll dsappoint you again. This is all my work forthe past twelve 
years. Richard Nixon put it beest "When the tough get going the good get 
tough." Well, that's easy for me to say. What amazes me about the United 
States at this point in time - is how the social safety net has been 
totallyeliminated in the four or five years of the Bush administration. In 
NY where we live (Brooklyn) there are suddenly dozens of homeless people 
and the soup kitchens are overflowing and no one is giving to those 
charities because the war in Iraq and Katrina absorbed the funds. So 
anyway In Huntington beach california, there was this fourth of july 
parade. and it was like the parades in the Soviet Union in the fities and 
sixties, goose-stepping kids, lots of armor, lots of salutes to the 
military - at least for me - i lived through too much of that periiod - it 
was frightening - and it was all for the sake of oil - Huntington Beach 
was at one point one of the largest producers of oil in the US - and these 
grasshoppers - this oil rigs - carrry american flags on it as if it makes 
everything all right - in Salt Lake City, dusk settles in, turns to night, 
the landscape is fairly devoured within the city limits, there's a short 
path, "nature path" through it, the Jordan River, it turned night there 
-we saw a couple of foxes that managed to survive . these were dreams and 
nightmares of figures and it took about two hours to make this - no this 
one took an hour I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING (said GOD).normally at this point 
I'd BE ON A ROOLLL and everything would be working perfectly hin harmony 
that is, but now already things are a bit out of control. here's a bunch 
of films all at once - can you tell which is moving? If you were seeing 
this in a theater and it was a harry potter movie, you can be sure 
soething really remarkably dramatic would b e going on. So hmmm... I'm not 
sure how to deal with this - I think the figure on the right HAS 
DIPTHERIA. Just watch. The woman above - hmmm.... she's got CHOLERA and is 
writing (heh what a misprint) wrything writhing in her last moments of 
life. Oh god I just looked to my right ALL OF YOU ARE STILL HERE... fuck, 
I didn't think so many had come . If you arrived in the last three or four 
minutes, you're lucky, you'll think this is all NEW. So you don't have to 
see the DUMP MOVIE again, how idiotic! God I could just watch myself on 
the screen forever and ever. Back to politics. The next video was shot on 
the grunds of the World Trade Center and the soundtrack is modified from 
WIFI signals in the area. Hold onto your hats! THIS I could WATCH FOREVER 
- this is the inside of my brain..... Is there a doctor in the house 
(doctor = sysadmin). At night, for exaple the night before last, I dreamed 
of bodies like these. And this afternoon I was napping and I dreamed of an 
explosion inside the equipment, that is, inside the euqipmetn, the digital 
equipment, that I was using to make these images. And the explosion 
happened inside me and the explosion destroyed me and all that was left 
were these images but you needed to understand the protocols to make sense 
of the images and maybe you didn't know the protocols or the protocols 
were absent ... So if they were absent, you'd have these bits and pieces 
of things, but they'd only be bits and pieces of flesh or something like 
flesh - the secret codes - that make things move - these codes would be 
gone they'd be gone gone they'd be gone machines - there'd be nothing left 
- you wouldn't see the bits of flesh hanging off the avatars - the 
animations which were nothing more than digital surfaces stapled LITERALLY 
on human bodies, the screams would be covered up, by --- I really can't 
think this through any longer, it's all there in the BOOK THE BIBLE.
At night, as I said, these things mix, they mix with me, they mix with the 
political and the death of bodies - It seems, I'd think, you could tell 
with of these figures on the left - which was real. But I'd have you 
fooled.... men are so stupid... On the right, yet another scene from 
Harrpy Power... On the left, yet another sceeen from Irak Warrior online. 
I recognize the hour on hand...
the hour on hand... this is somewhere somewhere this is... coming towards 
an end... The idea (according to Schelling - rather the Idea - is that 
when you play beach volleyball you PLAY WITH SOMEONE. hitting into the 
voice is a pure act of a very different sort of creation.... I think it's 
this.. that I'm just fucked up, that I think if I can't do something well 
at least I can do more of it - and that will make it better. But it just 
gets preposterous....sometimes you just do this sttuff and it stops
THANK YOU FOR COMING. There will be some time for questions and answwer s

ok, the buddha stuff < my > is running out of steam.
so what if the real can be turned beautiful?
can you turn prisoners out of hidden torture camps?
interesting to watch shattered-usa try to get out of this one.
we don't torture but whatever we do we protect you.
buddha disappears into a blur of colors.
the cpu distorts the reality it creates.
nothing is distorted and everyone using a computer knows nothing is
  created.
misery becomes everyone in the world.

Pray for the Pigeon

the pigeons, rock doves, don't live long in new york. yesterday i
saw one, feathers i think covered in oil, in any case, they were all
askew, she was begging for food like the rest of them, many won't
live through the winter, those who do often lose toes to frostbite.
there was nothing we could do. if you believe in a god, pray for her.
i don't, i can't. it's enough to report on this dove which haunted
my dreams, it's selfish, this haunting.

we need another universe. perhaps arrange buddda next to buddddha,
run as long as you like. i can't meditate, i can only watch a cycle
or two, but the files aren't all that large.

Updated knowledge-flux theory (original Perforations 3, 1992)


Epistemologically, the very concept of knowledge flow questions structure 
introspective self-consciousness. Digitizing - a form _matrix_ or _sieve_ 
topology guarantees both totalized reproducibility formatted and its 
neutrality. The former refers to channelling knowledge, latter "inertness" 
in relation previously inviolate operations introspection. also insures 
that is flux; flux necessitates gating continued channeling; these 
necessitate gate-keepers data-locators. Introspections becomes matter 
location within cyberspace. Cyberspace contentless; last vestige 
anthropocentrism disappear postmodernism _meaning_ itself. Meaning always 
spills beyond matrix; it occurring subterranean investment, an excess 
which remains irreducible. What meaning _attribute-meaning,_ 
_meaning-sub-x,_ where x given cognitive domain issues translation. From 
_beings_ _Being,_ from _meaning-sub-x_ _Meaning_: ultimately are 
transformations digital analog, matrix continuum, object subject, 
inscription fissure. rootedness "ultimate" sense Quine, untranslatable, 
regional morphology. "message" current video computer worlds, however, as 
with McLuhan medium _is_ message, "content" replaced by (or equivalent to) 
production-value. production-value but fetishizatio representation 
production overarching "originary" style absorbs debris, seepage that, 
fact, _communicates_ value, value production? Everywhere cyberspace, 
Gibson _Bladerunner_ notwithstanding, occurs clean room dirt exists only

communication channel well; represents producer, product, corporation,

capital well. increases extent recognized such; maintained through

ostensible ideally foreclosed bureaucracy. Hence introspection challenged

Anniversary


( For me an anniversary as Google goes (temporarily) over 100,000 w/ my 
listings. Why should I care? I'm pretty much disenfranchised, working 
outside institutional or (offline) community support; this is a barometer 
that at least some of the materials are surviving. I'll die happy. This 
morning I had gone from 97,600 to 92,400 - 142,000 is a temporary, if 
sanguine, anomaly. )

glow

perhaps like bachelard, believing in the secret life of things.
but is a reference necessary? things have their own glows, lives.
these lives are my comfort zones

the mystery of the vacuum, filament glows, hearths, from bulbs, tubes,
unlike the flatness of lcd screens (their own colder glows, glacial,
nonetheless kindly, empathetic)

when i was young, i would make drawing after drawing, tiny villages
from above, surrounded by protecting walls, almost a maze to enter,
i was safe there, i could leave, return home against the onslaught
and violence of others

sparking in vacuums, closed glass bells, inert and noble gases, and
the orange hue, the promise of life in the heart of radiation, of
radiation in the beating heart of life

throbbing candle flames, lanterns, amplifier and preamplifier tubes,
delight of email, lives through wire-nerves, radiation-nerves,
speaking to me, whisperings from the planet through the hours of day
and night, distant glimmers of eternity

darkling protocols, your imaginary voices, voices of the imaginary,
here i am, here you are, there i am, there you are, thinnest of 
glass enclosures, rounded and subtle, skeins of lives and families,
murmurings of love, colorations

vacuum uncanny, our absence from visible space, emptied, but not
quite, the quantum hearth churns, there are radiations, gravitations,
crossroads of silences, rumors of darkness and universal endings

but cathodic, traumatic, heatings, warmth of instrumentations, that
slightest trembling, our passional heat, our soft sleepings within
the blanketings of worlds and lazy atmospheres



the seed - ( secret interior life / drawings w/ 
comfort zones / mysteries of the vacuum 
glass / throbbing )

( our universe tiny, our place smaller, we huddle against the cold 
to come, we will have gone by then, we will unremember )

performance text, Sarah Lawrence, 12/08/05


i is cold here are you is cold. arrgh. should there be rhyme? this is 
close to the apocalypse. it's daytime in iraq. the 9/11 commission: "we 
fail." this is live. "this is memorex." it's i'm not sure what time in 
pakistan. winter's coming in. winter's coming into thailand isn't it? 
perhaps thailand is in south america. i don't know. something happened 
there and a lot of people died.
these images... sometime after abu gharayb i began dreaming of torn 
bodies. no that's not true, it happened a lot earlier, but abu gharayb 
confirmed things, that the united states was as capable of as much 
slaughter as any fascist country, thank you condaleeza. however you spel 
your nam. when you take a program and run it to its limits, you get these 
figures. the program tries to makesense of the files just as i try to make 
sense of the world but the world is going much too fast. every time i wake 
iin the middle of the night my entire life flies before my eyes. or rather 
i hear it before or within my ears. it's fast and furious. it's mapped 
everywhere. when i showed this work recently someone said it was just 
likie bush torturing people. i walked ou on him and almost came to blows 
but i avoided blows later someone else said i was closer to the apocalypse 
than anyone he knew.
how close can you get to the apocalypse? answer: 1.3 yards.
we are learning new ways to march which is all to the better. imitation is 
the best policy in guiding our young people in their future choise of 
carerrs.
what is surprising is that one wants to write anything these days. given 
the world-wide slaughter going on, it's hard to concentrate on a proper 
metaphor, what would work in a reading/writing, what wouldn't. even 
sending these images to the sky, absolutely a failure in the guise of 
someone on the ground just shot or blown up in iraq or on the streets of 
new york city.
i just can't get enough of drumming.
maybe if it wasn't so cold i'd be better able to think. welll i was away a 
few days ago and sat at harriet beecher stowe's desk where she wrote uncle 
tom's cabin so i sat at the desk and wrote to my uncle hymie.
this is the wolf at the door. after the bombing of the world trade center. 
shot obviouslly in the 'bathtub area' of the ruins. well i'd write some 
lyric poetry but my uncle adorno said i wasn't allowed to after auschwitz. 
well, i don't know whether i can agree with him or not but at least at 
this point i've forgotten how to rhyme. this is gerald edelman at a recent 
conference explaining how the brain works. well, i was jealous and all i 
could do was destroy his speech. heres an island for you. its reallly oil 
derricks off of long beach in california. people live out there. you could 
swim out to the derricks and the water is clean. or at least i think it 
is.
gary came to the door at 3am and said the water main broke and we went out 
and filmed it as the water went throgh the subway system and flooded 
through the cracks in the street. now... you might not noticve it, but 
this war, these wars, now they're continuous, there's no break, in 
war/terrorism/disease, whatever your pleasure, but these wars, they're 
really about the body, they're econsconsed in the body, i think that's not 
the way it's spelled, all this torture, lydnie englang posing with 
capitves.... all these signals, secret signs, the beheadings, if nothing 
else, you might want to watch one... on the internet, they're there, show 
you what's going on, someone else was killed, how? , today, bodies are 
turned into substance, that's the way apocaypse works - these were 
produced in west virginia, near ground zero of abu gharayb - i've tried 
god kknows i've tried to make sense of the world! i'm doing it at the 
moment it's impossible, too many things, what you're hearing now, this 
isn't the nuclear family, these are sounds... emissions.. from auroras, 
lightning, cosmic rays, magnetic storms, sunspots, the fury of the 
universe picked up by these antennas, now you hear the family now you 
don't. in any case, as you know, ahem, sexuality has increased on 
television something like two hundred percent since 1750!!! what a waste. 
iin fact, there were very few instances of intercourse or other naughty 
bits during the whole nineteenth century... it wasn't for lack of trying, 
certainly high definition came in around 1830 buit the studios were 
slow... on trying to decide what exactly to show...
it's ot silent, it's music for your ears.... i always love this one, it's 
west virginia at it's best, this kid can do this and it cn be heard for 
mielles, or at least into the other room -
now here's a poe.m someone called me a poet recently and i almost killed 
him. what's a poet? if we're not working at the edge of things are we 
doing anything at all? this is all my visual work for the past twelve 
years, i wanted to present something to you showing hmmm... my entire 
oeuvre, i hope you're not disappointed, it's really the only way... to 
guage the life of an artist, his/her works, what he/she is capable of, for 
example you might notice even at this speed that most of the photographs 
are in focus what you're hearing now is the dawn chorus, honestlyh, that's 
what it's called, it comes around dawn, very low frequency radio, just 
about the frequencies that you use when you talk, you can hear it 
sometimes, i'm not sure wht atht that it's exactly known,,, whatsproducing 
it.... but it began before humans ever hit the surface of the earth, even 
hit the surface of the earth running, one might say primoridal, since, 
since at least the beginning of the big bang, all the way back then, these 
crackles, this almost=whispering, some people think it's ghosts, aliens, 
it's just something to do with the ionosphere and the channeling of 
particles within it ... i took everyhthing i every made, it's cold typing 
here, i'm losing a bit of control, you can tell, the words just aren't 
flowing, but they really enver do, anyway, there are two categories from 
my images, natural/industrial, i went through... a little rorsach test... 
figuring out what i was interested in... why, becuase i made the images in 
the first place... someone had to do it... i can't stand the dawn much 
longer. that's better... almost human, something to listen to... i'm 
searching for something else to show you.... let's see, perhaps degas' 
dancers will open... some of the files have disappeared ALAS but that's 
what happens when you work on the internet....j oh god please turn 
away!"sondheim's show was seriously awful," not "awfully serious" as he'd 
like you to believe! anyway, you can only imagine... going into a museum 
and sneaking BENEATH the metal dress of one of Degas' dancers, shooting 
up, there were guards all around, i bet they never looked! actually there 
wasn't much to look at, to be honest, degas was naughty but not that 
naughty..
the best thing about landscapes is that they're unsteady - the 'ust' was 
created for an online site dealing with tsunami stuff - you can destroy 
whole towns with the click of amouse, or at least corrupt a file.... maybe 
not even that - in any case what you're hearing, this isn't earthquake 
proof this is the sound buildings make when you raise the pitch a little, 
i forget what building made this but i'll never forget her voice...
and this was done thinkingabout mining in pennsylvnia, wwe were just 
talking about that, something like 50000 dying every decade from the small
counties and towns in northeast pa...  - do you ever wake up in the 
morning or the middle of the night and say to yourself"
i want my work to MEAN i want to make a DIFFERENCE in the world and you 
realize no one is thinking
 (shut up! i'm in the middle of a bad poem)
and you realize no one wants to hear what you're saying anyway
and there are os many things you migth say or write
but then you think
IT"S ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE (now I'm REALLY ON IT HEH!)
yes, everyone has heard EVERYHTING BEFORE, just like that but then (THANK 
GOD FOR MULTITAKSING) but then ... it's oddly quiet here... i'm on my 
own... i'm not sure what else you migth want to see, the surfrod movie 
just died on me, shouldher is still runing, the willat sond is mubmbling 
in the background, that's more building stuff slowed up
NOW WHAT YOU'RE hearing really isn't sound recorded by a microphopne - it 
just sounds that way - these are antennas that are coupled to radios - 
you're hearing radio interference - Azure's stomping, coupling with the 
antenna, generating static electricity, the mandolin strings are coupling 
with a second antenna. so h.... it's not like, it's not like the real 
labor of music, O THE BEAUTY!
this is foofwa' d'imobilite dancing as fast as he can and i'm playing as 
fast as i can and azure' ignoring us. we did this twice in performance, we 
lasted about ten minutes, it doesn't look fast but honest.. it is ... 
wait, i'll show you later. please note: the image on the right is 
something to entertain you.
you can do neat stuff with it. it's a kind of sex-machine but it's really 
nothing but a two-dimensional projection of a bunch of polygons.
btw by the way this isn't sped up, foofwa dances like that, eats fast too.
ok, as you can tell i'm trying to figure out how to end i'll play some 
fast guitar and show you , well, his presentation sucked, it was all over 
the place i didn't get a damn thing out of it but he sure can play fast 
guitar
...and people thought that hippies were dead....
what's interesting btw about this series, these visual echoes of my work, 
that one picks out, the bodies stand out, the nudity appears almost 
foregrounded, it's the way the mind works, almost imprinting, well most 
likely instinctual impriting, against everything else, the chaos of 
everyday life, sooner or later this soundtrack will run out and i'll be 
done, we started with moments of apocalypse and torture, ran through a 
whole middle section of nothing much happening at all, but i think i saved 
it with some really terrific guitar playing, something like yo've never 
heard before, there goes a whole blues! just like that, i wish i could 
type that fast, it would make for a much ore interesting evening,, thank 
you, good bye
