(Bob Marley)
If dem want to win the revoloution
Must win it, wit rasta!
Can't win no other way
Because if you win other way, you go fight again
If rasta win, den no more war

(Busta Rhymes)
Yeah

(Bob Marley)
Hear the words of the rasta man say
Babylon your throne gone down, gone down
Babylon your throne gone down

(Busta Ryhmes)
And it goes like that what you talkin about
What you talkin about, what you talkin about
Yeah, yeah, what you talkin about
Yeah, yeah, what you talkin about 

(Bob Marley)
Did I hear the words of the higher man say
Babylon your throne gone down, gone down
Babylon your throne gone down
Did I hear the angel wit the seven seals
Babylon your throne gone down, gone down
Babylon your throne gone down

(Busta Rhymes)
Whatchu say? Whatchu talkin about?

(Bob Marley)
I say fly away home to Zion (fly away home)
I say fly away home to Zion (fly away home)
One bright morning when man work is over man will fly away home

(Busta Rhymes)
Take it back to the home land 
Where the holy sacred and pure is at
Na'mean?

(Bob Marley)
One bright mornin when my life is over I will fly away home

(Busta Rhymes)
Yeah, yeah
Fool, fool boy you must fe wan't die 
Anyhow you try disrespect King Selassie
Bruk two ah yuh foot and tab yuh in ah yuh eye
Wit proper information bout rastafarai
Make sure you read bible and salute the most high
The ones who don't know be the ones who ask why
That His imperial majesty really get crucify
Allow'll real get the colour blue in ah the sky
Why after you feed the youth the baby still ah cry
You need Ja, in ah yuh life, me nah to yuh no lie
Betta believe the I and I really verify
Spirit of salaseai will take you very high
They want me stop this time sit down the other guy
Long time we ah wait to see we people unify
Clean out we self and real's start purify
We done uniform you know it's straight mulitply
Straight multiply, know it's straight multiply

(Bob Marley)
I say fly away home to Zion (Fly away home)
I say one bright mornin when my work is over I will fly away home

(Busta Rhymes)
Ay, yo, Spliff where you at?

(Spliff Starr)
I hold my glass up high, and I toast to the most high
Since my B-day up to this day is close by
Watchin over me, while Babylon scopin me
From my mother's womb they took my mind started mouldin me
Like Mookie on the crock I heard the devil callin me
By the powers of Ja, he took the devils off of me
I can see clearly now, I'm stepping with authority
God blessed you, I got the whole world supportin me
Ja, is my friend different from the enemy them
I talks to him shoutin out lookin up to heaven
Gave me a call he said I want you tell them all
That you shall witness when Babylon fall
All you shall witness when Babylon fall
All you shall witness when Bablyon fall

(Busta Rhymes)
Yeah
Street chronicle for the evening
The truth, the undisputed Flipmode Squad
