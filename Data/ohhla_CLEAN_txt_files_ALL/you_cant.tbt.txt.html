[Mannie Fresh]
Ahhhhh
True Story
Fo shoeezy

[Verse One: Mannie Fresh]
Who rock shit that you neva seen befo?
The charge goes to me, then Mike, then the store
Two way beepers with built in speakers
Three inch woofers one inch tweezers
The one and only
Mac like roni
Sharp like my bitch and pretty like Tony
Trucks big leather room table beds
(cat meowing)Siberian tiger spreads
The call me Emmit cuz I only ride twenty two's
Emmit Smith numba twenty two get it dude
Smoke so much body smell like... WEED!
Get cut Cristal is whut I.... bleed
Got money then bitch come early
Got a Benz that come out in 2030
Cardel frames that make me look nerdy
Now who's the baller now WHARDIE!

[Chorus 2X: Lac]
Go on hate me
You can't break me
Usta ride new shit but not none lately
Wassup nigga? still ride old schools?
84 cutlass with the European light fools

[Verse Two: Baby]
Give me a dove and watch how I flip the bitch
One, two, three, four, five slick
Uno, dose
Bentleys and Rovers
Jags, Hummers, Rags its over
Put the kit up nigga lets break it down
Hit the curb bust the tires Im fucked up now
Whip my wheel twenty inches
Catch my thrills I've been pimpin
Look ice my life
Fuck what's right
Twenty on the four wheel will fit it tight
Do..noughts in a truck
Corvette lights on a pickup
Baby girl on the bus.... jump off
Step on Ealton and Cleave.... break her off
Bentleys on Gold D's
Nigga say I'm trippin but you niggaz gotta let me be me
Wodie
Let this life
Wodie
I done earned my stripes
I'm Goldie
I'm a pimp for life
I'm Platinum
Let me shoot the dice

[Chorus 2X: Lac]
Go on hate me
You can't break me
Usta ride new shit but not none lately
Wassup nigga? still ride old schools?
84 cutlass with the European light fools

[Verse Three: Stone]
Look
I push a kitted tinted Lex
Steering wheel on the right
Bubble eye eggshell with the extra pipes
Rich nigga I got money to buy an extra life
Now I'm gonna mind hell tryin to live trife
So its my life to life with three strikes on me
With a four five on my six to get the lights off me
Like I'm a seven figga nigga drinkin ice on me
And for eight to nine years ten been the price for a key

[Verse Four: Lac]
I got some shit
Why not stunt?
This is much bigger then broke niggas with gold fronts
Big rocks in my watch like 'Montz got
Quarters on my trucks and a Hatch full of punch
Got a Bentley and a Jag nigga
With some twenty inch Mag nigga
License plate says bad nigga
Got a new bike chromed and stretched
Got a 50 for my son that I love to death

[Chorus 4X: Lac]
Go on hate me
You can't break me
Usta ride new shit but not none lately
Wassup nigga? still ride old schools?
84 cutlass with the European light fools</pre>
