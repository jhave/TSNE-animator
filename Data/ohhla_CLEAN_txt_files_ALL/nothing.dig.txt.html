Recognise this colour

[Shock G]
Yeah, all-Atlantic, all-Pacific, all-City
Yes, the Shuttle continues to reach out and explore
To boldly go where No Face has gone before
Soon it will be obvious that when we taste the colour
We shall finally see the picture

Can you feel this colour?
I'm feeling you, my brother, can't you colour me funky!
Can you see this flavour?
And if you miss me don't dis me, just colour me funky!
Do you taste this picture?
I'm feeling you, my brother, can't you colour me funky!
D-Flo is still witcha
So if you miss me don't dis me, just picture me funky!

No, nothing has changed
Even the day remains the same
I'm still down to clown around
Still coming from the Underground
Still kick it real smooth
Is the way that you perceive me
Has it been coloured
By the way you've been treated
In a situation that comes to mind

I hope it ain't, and make sure that the paint
That you use to paint me with has got funk in it
See nothing has changed except for you and I
Don't let the lights from the TV change the way you see me
Takes a lot of time to go from town to town
And very seldom can a brother settle down, G
We need to funk! Don't be alarmed, ain't nothing changed
We been around the world but, yo, we still can drop the bomb

[Chorus]
Nothing has changed except for you and I
Nothing has changed except for you, oh no, no
Nothing has changed except for you and I
Nothing has changed

Can you feel this colour?
Yeah, I'm feeling you my brother, won't you colour me funky!
Can you see this flavour?
And if you miss me don't dis me, just picture me funky!
Do you taste this picture?
I said I'm feeling you my brother, won't you colour me funky!
D-Flo is still witcha
So if you miss me don't dis me, just picture me funky

Nothing has changed except for you and I
Please don't let the lights that blind
Change the way that you see me
It takes a lot of time to go from town to town
Spreading the funk around

[Chorus]

[Shock G]
No Face will be coming through for you
No Face will be coming through for you
The D-Flo Shuttle will be coming through for you
P-Funk is still coming through for you</pre>
