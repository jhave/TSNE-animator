(Intro)
Yeah, aight
See, what I want y'all to do
I want y'all to open up y'all Bacardi's

(Hook)
The way the women keep watchin us
Well gimme some will power, Bacardi
In this New World Order
This New World Order
This new world
In this new world
In this new world
In THIS new world
Women Keep watchin us
Well gimme some will power, Bacardi
In this New World Order
This New World Order
This new world
In this new world

(Verse 1)
Better move ya body-ody, uh
We doin it thug style, we in the party
Women are buck wild, turnin around
Interior, show me what'chu workin with-workin with
You be on that erkin-jerkin, you be on that twerkin, quit it
You got to admit it, that'chu on a mission to have a good time
With a pocket full of paper, keepin a pocket full of mine
Twenty fours, that's mine
Caught spinnin 'em blind
Came in the club off the bus and spent mine, divine
Gimme Kalu and I'll maneuver little Henny and wine
I stepped back in the rap game, passed my prime
Chain swingin like the links, up in prison we shine
Like Katt said, "Grind baby, one more time"
In the corner at the table, surrounded by glock babels
Get'cha gangsta endurance, and y'all just represent the label
And um, and um, and um
Better move ya-better move ya body-ody-ody

(Hook)
The way the women keep watchin us
Well gimme some will power, Bacardi
In this New World Order
This New World Order
This new world
In this new world
In this new world
In THIS new world
Women Keep watchin us
Well gimme some will power, Bacardi
In this New World Order
This new world 
In this new world
In this new world

(Verse 2)
Better move ya body-ody
Three step, two step, walk wit it
Cha-cha, slide to the side, baby get it-get it
Square there, hit that, get back
Move kitten move! You can do you too when the mood's hittin
Baby you don't need no permission, get real close
No bullshittin, keep up the rhythm and make a choice
Now move with it, what shall I do with it
Through with it, you can act a fool with it, watch my toes
Oh, you did it
Sway to the side with a true fitted
Put it on, meet me at the table
That's where you sittin
Mmm, give me attitude
Gratitude, peace, wait up
Before you flee's, may I buy you a drink please?
Class and I'll show you a glass
You can thug out in the corner with a flask
Watchin the cars pass me by
With my tipsy eyes, be at the club at the party
And my word the wise is
Better move ya body

(Hook)
Keep watchin us
Now gimme some will power, Bacardi
In this New World Order
This new world
In this new world
In this new world
In this new world
In THIS new world
Women Keep watchin us
Well gimme some will power, Bacardi
In this new world
In this new world
In this new world
In this new world
In THIS new world

(Verse 3)
Better move ya body-ody
Laughin over bud, but feelin lovely
If your women wanna touch me, then hand cuffs
Enough and bust playa smooth shit
Pass by then we outtie
Get rough with me, rowdy
She still gon' come around me
Fresh like Cool Water, flip collar, Downy
Khaki's freshly creased like I'm fresh out the county, howdy
Tell the truth, catch a candle, relief
Now it's me and you, so my dogs don't doubt me
Do what we do over drinks, club closin
Last call, last song, stay calm, now how do I know
I hit the dance floor, once we get on it, we on it
Shake hands at the party, keep a number and I'm goin um
Better move ya-better move ya-better move ya body-ody
Better move ya-better move ya-better move ya body-ody
Better move ya-better move ya-better move ya body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody

(Hook)
The way the women keep watchin us
Well gimme some will power, Bacardi
In this New World Order
This new world
In this new world
In this new world
In this new world
In THIS new world
Women Keep watchin us
Well gimme some will power, Bacardi
In this New World Order
This new world
In this new world
In THIS new world
In THIS new world
Better move ya body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody
Better move ya body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody
Better move ya body-ody-ody
Let's ride
The way the women keep watchin us
Well gimme some will power, Bacardi
In this New World Order
