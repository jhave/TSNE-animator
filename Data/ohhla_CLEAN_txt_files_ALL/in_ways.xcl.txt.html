[Professor X]
(In the ways of the scale)
The plug has been lifted from the unjoint jar
All cascade of black, perfume of the hour
(In the ways of the scale)
The past has been written, rolled and sealed in a scroll
(In the ways of the scale)
The eyes of the hawk ranges the sky unblinking
OPENED
(In the ways of the scale)
PERFECT

[Brother J]
Once again, the illogical one
Bring your mind state to dark side of the sun
Music for creators to give no slacks
So I stepped from the board to keep my eyes on black
Now my religion is reality come take a drink from the great verb stick
Coming with authority grouping the majority this is not your gimmick or your fraudulent trick
Now I see children of originals doomed to lose
Teachers and preachers remain confused
Talking about humans in true black ways
Talking revolution and you're out to entertain
Ignorance, I grab you by your crackhead neck
take you back to Egypt where you'll learn respect
And on one knee and through one way
You'll follow out the path of the new sun way
Let it click, here comes the royal of authority
Grooving up the masters of majority
People have a problem with my step
But you see I'm an example of the X
I travel with my bag with my books and fruits
Rose up the ?frowl? not jeans and boots
Tip from the sundial time for the drum
Dum-diddy-dum funk coat has begun to the scales

[Professor X]
Above all of ? I rise like the sun
Like the moon above day palms
Where there is light I enter absolute
Where there is dark there is none of me 
Like the moon above day palms I rise
I am sworn to life, I am bound to death
I take my oath under the sword


There's no beginning and there is no end - - &gt; Tom Tom Club

[Brother J]
Scale of ? speak ballads
I never ill, I never will,  I won't have it
You see queens are of men and real men don't play
It's like moon for the night time and sun for day
I am an African, I don't wear Greek
Must of we be reminded of the legendary thief
Who tried to make peace in comparison to Egypt
But they got gypped cause their minds not equipped
I see a cave boy and they try to play black
Give a +Gasface+ and you're bound to get slapped
And don't play stupid I'm a pyramid stalker
Witness my soul on the bas-? road
Chilling with the pharaohs and my ages has been
 Doing this forever and you asked since when
Time is but a word and of little concern
And not another second will we red burn
To walk one way and to walk one path
Ways of the scale of the aftermath

There's no beginning and there is no end - - &gt; Tom Tom Club

[Brother J]
Welcome to my science now seems you're always with it
Brother J, funk me, I come again, I stick it
Some say it's too deep and some say strong
Some say the truth hurts and I say wrong
Awaken Osiris, it's time for war
 Mount your chariot, I can't take no more
Life or death, it doesn't matter I come again
There's no beginning and there is no end
Popped the stage, turn the page
Coming of Isis, Queen Mother Rage
Witness the sex Overseer the X
Verbalizer funk and listen give a taste, what's next
Show and improve, what's the true move
You come inside and present the strong groove
It's really about time for a kick like this
Ways of the scale scientific fist, have a kiss

[Professor X]
By the way, vanglorious!
This is protected
by the red, the black, and the green
at the crossroad! SISSSSSY! 
With a key!
