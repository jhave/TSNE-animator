[Intro] [Bishop talking]
The following view expressed in the recording
in no way reflect the thoughts of my label
It's just me. Stacee Adams, every motherfuckin' hood in America
Every ghetto in the world. Niggas feelin' the same way

[Verse One] [Bishop Lamont]
So on huff, niggas think I'm roided
This west coast shit, you punks almost destroyed it
Wack ass, backwards niggas always spill it to spoil it
Take a shit in the sink and wash they hands in the toilet

[Stacee Adams]
Man it's the pinnacle
Five star general, slash criminal
With guns on the hunt for the cash, a hundred mil or two
Ask Adams and Bishop
Same difference
Two of the best, come from the west on the same mission
Blood or Crip, I got love for this shit
We can all buy cribs, throw dubs on the six

[Bishop Lamont]
But see, niggas like him, I can't fuck with them
+Follow The Leader+ is classic, but I don't follow the trends
Niggas do whats ever out cause they say that it's in
Hmmm, if you don't get it, nod your head and pretend
Goin' out like that, being a bitch to get wealth
I'm a vampire in the mirror, I can't see myself

[Chorus] [Bishop] [x2]
Niggas say they the truth but can't handle the truth
They say they keep it real but homie where's your proof?
Real recognize real no matter the distance
Go all around the world, it's the same damn difference

[Verse Two] [Bishop Lamont]
The president got guns and sell drugs like the gangstas and thugs
But all you see on TV is us
The Terminator kid took you for political advancement
Damn I wonder why they still ain't killed Charles Manson
Or Richard Ramirez
Ain't they murderers?
I guess ex-gang bangers are worse than Satan worshipers
I'm like, "God damn. He was writin' children books.
They writin' pentagrams in they hands"

[Stacee Adams]
They try'd to give a nigga 20 years for a gun without a trail
All the while
The pastor at church is a pedophile
What kind of sick fuck violates an innocent child
Same nigga pull a K out and shoot in the crowd
Like a bitch fuckin' niggas for free, she's still whorin'
Same difference
Might as well get paid for it
It's like a race against time, who can die the richest?
Whether it's crime or you get it legit, same difference

[Chorus] [Bishop] [x2]
Niggas say they the truth but can't handle the truth
They say they keep it real but homie where's your proof?
Real recognize real no matter the distance
Go all around the world, it's the same damn difference

[Verse Three]
I love Pooty Tang but fuck Chris Rock
John Lennon was assassinated, what about Pac?
And Biggie
Didn't all three get shot?
It's the same damn difference, they just niggas off the block
The plot
Get's thicker if you want it to
Shit, I think they killed Eazy, I'll explain on part two
It's a story about power and greed and dividends
And how they did Eazy Ruthless when he made ?

[Stacee Adams]
Shit, they might as well said, "Fuck it"
Put the gauge to this chin
Same difference
Another legend lost in the end
They tell me, keep my friends close and my enemies even closer
For the bread?
Your own brother will butter you with the toaster
It all revolve around money and power
Arrest us for sellin' cane when they supplying the powder
It's contradicting
Dollars and cents
Politicians just as crooked as the niggas in jail
Same difference

[Chorus] [Bishop] [x2]
Niggas say they the truth but can't handle the truth
They say they keep it real but homie where's your proof?
Real recognize real no matter the distance
Go all around the world, it's the same damn difference</pre>
