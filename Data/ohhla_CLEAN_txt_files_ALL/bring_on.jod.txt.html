[Jodeci]
I beeped you, baby ya have to clear me from the dance floor
Trying to look in my window, but you just couldn't see me though
You attracted me with all your body, uh do you wanna roll with me
Through uptown

[Timbaland]
All I got is that old funk
So let it bang and boom in ya trunk
Girl I know that's what you want, that, that funk

[Jodeci]
I know you want it, and you know I got it baby
Anything you want from me baby
Girl if you want it, just come get it from me
Anything you want from me, I'm trying to tell you bring on that funk
Bring on da funk, bring on da funk
Bring on da funk, bring on da funk
Bring on da funk, bring on da funk
Bring on da funk, now

[K-Ci]
Now you know, you really do fit my steelo
You can flow, I just got to know
Do you wanna roll with me, sweet lady in my Jeep
Let's keep it all discreet, I'm just a simple freak babe

[Timbaland]
All I got is that old funk
So let it bang and boom in ya trunk
Girl I know that's what you want, that funk, that funk
All I got is that old funk
So let it bang in ya trunk
Girl I know that's what you want, uh that funk

[Jodeci]
Girl if you want it, just come get it from me
Anything you want from me, I'm trying to tell you bring on that funk
