[The Game]
Aye 50, get them niggaz some iced out badges to go with them used cars you bought 'em nigga
I am the West Coast nigga, and ain't shit that can change that, hahahaha

[Chorus - The Game]
Here come the G-Unit Crips, call the cops
Here come the G-Unit Crips, call the cops
Here come the G-Unit Crips, call the cops
Nigga's runnin with a motherfuckin snitch so its g-g-g-unot
Here come the G-Unit Crips, call the cops
Here come the G-Unit Crips, call the cops
Here come the G-Unit Crips, call the cops
Nigga's runnin with a motherfuckin snitch so its g-g-g-unot
You niggaz ain't crips, you niggaz ain't bloods
You just little G-Unit run around thugs
You niggaz ain't crips, you niggaz ain't bloods
You just little G-Unit run around thugs

[Verse 1 - The Game]
Yeah nigga I'm loco but not like loco
Red rag in my pocket, got gangbanging in the chokehold
Red spokes on my low low, oh no
Nigga call the po po, Game got a fo fo
Guns by the boatload, niggaz rappin so so
Def like Jermaine, talking bout they gangbang
Whats a West Coast nigga from a East Coast gang
A free 300 C, and a G-Unit chain
Now he running with the po po, nigga even BO know
50 starts singing like KC and JoJo
Catch me slippin nigga I hope so
You wanna go to war, we can do it on both coasts

What's up cuz, what's up blood
What's up cuz, what's up wankstas
What's up cuz, what's up blood
What's up cuz, what's up wankstas

[Chorus]

[Verse 1 - Techniec] 
We loadin up clips, handin out slugs
Out the 645 sittin on dubs
With some real crips, and some real bloods
I ain't with the bullshit, nigga easy up
I ain't with the bullshit, nigga easy up
High in the air, got the wrist freeze up
Same nigga that don't bang
But you could back ya ass up nigga, cause the 5th gon flame
While you at it, move ya eyes off my wall street chain
They say we movin like an organized street gang
All hues of blue, all shades of flame
New west coast we doin the damn thang
This year we make power moves
With O.G.'s that been home, niggaz still bathe in their shower shoes
Grown full, I never move how a coward move
Never heard of defeat bitch, I don't know how to lose
Thought it would end, but it seems we ain't done
Boy wagin war on the coast he ain't from
Tryin to pit niggaz against us, cancel Christmas
It'll be a lot of sense ????

(Chorus - The Game)
Here come the G-Unit Crips, call the cops
Here come the G-Unit Crips, call the cops
Here come the G-Unit Crips, call the cops
Nigga's runnin with a motherfuckin snitch so its g-g-g-unot
Here come the G-Unit Crips, call the cops
Here come the G-Unit Crips, call the cops
Here come the G-Unit Crips, call the cops
Nigga's runnin with a motherfuckin snitch so its g-g-g-unot
You niggaz ain't crips, you niggaz ain't bloods
You just little G-Unit run around thugs
You niggaz ain't crips, you niggaz ain't bloods
You just little G-Unit run around thugs

[Verse 3 - The Game]
See Game in the streets, see Game with his chain hangin
Hood tatted on his neck, nigga I'm gangbangin
Blood, this is Piru, nigga I told y'all
*Menace to Society*, never met O-Dog
Time for the roll call, homies come in handy
Taeda and Row from Mafia, Big-Y from the Family
BIG T from Grape Street, 60's that's Titta-Rock
Mob got Tammy-Ru, Face run Cedar Block
Don't fuck with me homies, I know Jova from T-Flats
Downa from the 18th Streets let the heat clap
Tre-D from Insane, Bg Woody from Nutty Block
Main Streets got Dell-Dogg, Wood, and Stutter Box
Got this motherfucker locked, try to move how I do
Might run into Wacko from West Side Piru
K-Dog, and T-Money, Mansfield Thugs
2-Ts and Du-Dog from Bounty Hunter Bloods
Magic from Avalon, Twin from Santana
Bird from Hoover know for the Orange Bandana
Rick James from Fruit Town, Bam in the Denver Lanes
Big-T, East Coast Crip Gang
Big Fish from 1-9, DUB C from 1-11
Big Sharp from Playboy, J-Box from 9-7
Candy Man from Swans, Steve from PJ Watts
you call 'em G-Unit Crips, I call 'em cops

What's up cuz, what's up blood
What's up cuz, what's up wankstas
What's up cuz, what's up blood
What's up cuz, what's up wankstas
