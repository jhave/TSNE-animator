Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Yo.. just.. count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Better count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Better count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(I say to thee well count your blessings)

I remember when I used to get depressed
Overwhelmed by the stress
Feeling my life was the illest mess
Always dwelling on the stuff that wasn't right
And staring at the four walls in my room all night
Searching for a way to cope
The situation shaky like I'm walkin on a tightrope
But now I see it's time to get a handle
and take control of things
So for me, I'ma light a candle
And other people got it worse
I get a lot of love, so I ought give my thanks first

Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Better count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(I said you better count your blessings)

Too many times I asked, "Why me?"
And I recall when things weren't goin how they 'sposed to be
Yeah I know you dig what I'm relayin
And now I find myself devoting more time to praying
I ain't saying that I don't do no wrong
I'm saying I ain't trying to sing no more sad songs
I got mad responsibilities
I'm building with my family, my loved ones depend on me
I've got no time for envy nor for hate
My inner power's too strong
to let such evil penetrate
The world around is in chaos
But I'd rather seek the truth to be found
than to be lost
Experience is always the best teacher
Look at the signs, feel the vibes, I'm tryin to reach ya
I see how much now that one should be grateful for
And we must help the others who can't find a open door

Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Better count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Better count your blessings)

Now as we head into the year 2000
and more and more people can't even get decent housing
Poor education in the schools
and poor employment structures, so some choose illegal tools
By all means, you know we must survive, but think
the energy we give always comes back to us in time
We must decide to make the proper choices
Or the only thing we'll hear is the cries and the screaming voices

Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times
Too many times, too many times

Too many times I felt bad
Too many times I couldn't see what I really had
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Better count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Better count your blessings)
Too many times I felt bad (count your blessings)
Too many times I couldn't see what really I had
(Better count your blessings) .. *fades*</pre>
