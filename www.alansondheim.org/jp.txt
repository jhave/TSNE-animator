

Strange Phenomenon


Below, I sent a response to myself on the alt.jen-coolest newsgroup, and
was easily able to spoof an address; while the appearance of full headers
indicates the address is problematic, it doesn't trace back to me. This
was so easy to do that I wonder about the relative security of newsgroups.

Certainly a sysadmin could see something was amiss, but for most readers,
the source is anomalous. And if I can do this, any ten-year-old can. Mean-
while I have done a minor drumming for myself, and feel terrible - but
then I'm coming down with minor bronchitis.

HYMEN CLASH


We were trying to write a collaborative piece about subjectivity and
sexuality, illness and masochism. But as we began developing our dialogue
through electronic mail, we found ourselves taking up sexualized positions
within the discourse, such that our original issues were lost in issues of
control over the text.

We attempted a text dealing with masochism from the double viewpoint of
sexuality and chronic pain. Doors unlocked and locked; the resulting mas-
ochistic text satisfied no one. It fastens/fascinates.

Laurie Cubbison / Alan Sondheim


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Laurie:
i write about pain because it's a constant in my life. it's always here.  
there's a song by the judds called "mr. pain". the woman sings about the  
fact that mr. pain is the only lover who is always there. other men come  
and go, but mr. pain is a faithful suitor.                                

Alan:                                                                         
Then perhaps it is mr. pain you're responding to?

Laurie:
perhaps it is. perhaps that's the problem with this text.

Alan:
I'd say they're probably singing about emotional pain, which is an inroad 
to the suitor - in other words, it's connected to sexuality, masochism.   
Desire is a constant in my life; there are others, exhaustion, occasional 
depression, these texts...  

Laurie:
but for me, desire is derailed by pain and exhaustion. i become not sexually 
passive as a result but passive in the face of sexuality.        

Alan:                                                                     
I understand this; I was commenting on the song.                          

Laurie:                                                    
i suppose i feel fragile in a lot of ways. physically. emotionally. yes, 
i've survived. i'm over the worst in terms of emotional pain. i'm at a point 
in my life where a lot of the problems have been resolved, fixed.   

Alan:
We all have...                                                            

Laurie:
but the problem with fixing anything is that the fix doesn't remove the 
damage done. it only makes the object functional again. so, yes, i'm 
functional, but i feel fragile. i wait for the next thing to go wrong and
put me in the hospital.                                                   

Alan:                                                                          
But as I've said to you, this is already a suture, foreclosing, on the
subject; you've made and closed down the case for yourself. Expecting the
worst or interpreting everything in terms of the worst precludes the
possibility of other emotional responses. 

Laurie:                                                                          
not completely. there are the surprise, relief, even joy, when the worst is 
not realized. but expecting the worst, not getting one's hopes up too high, 
is a defense mechanism. i meet a man. i like him. i start to get my hopes 
up. bam. he's married. or not interested. or too far away. how long can you 
expect good things and end up with bad things before it affects your outlook 
on life? one gets tired of the emotional turmoil, of thinking maybe this 
time i will be hired, maybe this time i will get laid, and it ends up with a 
feeling of 'of course, it wasn't going to happen, i was a fool to think it 
would'. 

Alan:
This is a different problem than that of the physical pain, and I'm not sure 
what to say. I've said you're short-circuiting yourself above; I can't get 
closer to this. All of us ride the backs of failure.

Laurie:
but the physical pain and the emotional pain reinforce each other, are 
intertwined.

Alan:   
I understand this; I just don't know where to go from here. You've made your 
point, but your writing doesn't really call for dialog; it closes itself off. 

Laurie:
i don't want to close off the dialog though perhaps i am. i'm wanting to
convey the effect of illness, wanting you to understand how constrained i
feel. 

Alan:
But there are two goals here, one between us, which is the conveyance, and 
the other, our ability to discuss sexuality/masochism/disability and their 
interactions. And what's happened here is that you feel yourself 
constrained to emphasize how bad you feel, and that does foreclose. What 
can I say? I am sorry you feel this way. And I've known you for a long time, 
so it seems that you "wanting you to understand how constrained I feel" are 
delivering a different message, that you want to _hammer_ your constraint 
home, until the text comes to a halt.

Laurie:
but remember, that you are not the only audience here. i am speaking to you 
but we are also writing this text for publication. can i not include among 
'you' the people who don't know me?

i think about prozac, that one of the side effects is the lowering of the 
libido. and for some people that's an unacceptable side effect. but for me, 
who loses libido to pain and depression any way, the functioning it brings 
ends up being more important than any effect it may or may not have on my 
desire.  

Alan:                                
I can understand this; I also think I have more desire, perhaps addictive 
desire, than most.                                                           

What are you saying in relation to the subject? That depression is 
masochistic, as well as physical pain, that you're burdened by your entire 
life, physical and mental? Other than being concerned, I don't know what to 
say to this...                                                             

Laurie:                                                                          
i think perhaps that is what i am saying.                                    

Alan:   
Which is also a way of silencing me, although you don't mean it. My re-
sponses here have a repetitive character, as you know.     

Laurie:
but they're serving the purpose i'd hope they would, to draw out of me an 
articulation of my feelings in this area.

Alan:
But then the dialog is a monolog with commentary...

Laurie:   
i suppose that i am in a state of ongoing abjection. always unstable, 
between states. shifting toward frustration, depression and despair. a small 
wing back to hope and contentment every once in a while.                
i suppose i am too wrapped up in myself, in my own pain and fear, though i'm 
not so bad as i used to be.  i read that last clause and give a sour 
chuckle. the badness attached to myself. 

Alan:   
Even "sour chuckle" reverts to depressive attitudes; these paragraphs are 
signifiers of collapse themselves. I can't see desire emerging here; 
whatever my interpretation of masochism might be, deliberate loss of 
control, release, splaying/opening, flooding of desire, ecstasis and 
momentary annihilation, maternal chora, babbling, shitting, pissing - it's 
not found here, in your text, nor is there a space/site for it. "Wrapped up" 
in yourself is a mummy-metaphor, death and detumescence already foregone, 
completed. In other words, I can't find a way through this into my own 
stance or "take"; there's no place for jouissance, and instead I tend 
towards thinking about resources for overcoming depression.                     

Laurie:                                                                       
and that i think is why i'm uncomfortable with masochism. 

Alan:
Because I express concern for you? What I find is a thicket of emotional and 
physical pain that you present; I can't think clearly through this. It 
sounds in fact that your uncomfortableness is with everything. I still don't 
see masochism as necessarily intersecting with the states you describe; if 
anything, it can be an aid in overcoming them. But in your texts, the 
cotton-thickness is dense enough to preclude that. 

Laurie: 
No, not because you express concern for me but because i can't see a 
connection or a release in it for me.                                      

Alan:
But there's no reason it should necessarily work for you at all. And
"being uncomfortable" with masochism can mean either you're not person-
ally interested, which is fine, or that it's not of interest to you, i.e. 
other masochists make you uncomfortable.

Laurie:
i'm not sure that that's how i'm feeling. I won't say it doesn't 'interest' 
me but that i don't see a place for me in it. i don't want to be a 
masochist. i feel that i live that life already in my own body, but neither 
do i want to be a dominatrix.                                         

Alan:
But no one is asking you to take one or another position; discussing 
something doesn't mean you're identifying as a participant.

Laurie:
but don't you know me well enough by now that i always discuss by
identifying with the experience? by playing with it? do i want to position
myself in that way or this? what would i do if that were my position? it
is by considering issues through experiential positions that i think
through issues. 

but i don't see how it could be an aid in overcoming the pain. please explain. 

Alan:
Because it can be a way of controlling one's body, releasing it to another, 
returning from that control.

Laurie:
i would have to experiment to know if that would work, but of course there 
aren't any lab partners available.  

Alan:
No, and I doubt it would work for you, since it would return your body and
your pain to you, and you've talked already about being uncomfortable with
that. 

Laurie:
i'm not a masochist, even though i'm passive. i don't want to be controlled. 
i feel that i've always already been controlled against my will, by my 
mother, by my body. but i don't have the energy to be controlling, nor the 
desire. i don't know what kind of lover that makes me.   

Alan:  
But you are already controlling yourself through intense negations that 
don't let up. Your writing introjects control, suffocates other 
possibilities. Masochism is simultaneously about control and the conditions 
of the boundary - first, the temporarily violated boundary of the body, and 
second, the release into and release out of the masochistic 
state/session/etc. - these boundaries of recovery enunciating the theatrics 
of everyday life and their overcoming.                                       

Laurie:
well, if i'm controlling myself, then at least no one else is. 
 
but what do you mean by the temporarily violated boundary of the body? 

Alan:
The masochist session, or time, the body returning to itself. As far as
controlling, aren't you also, in a way, controlling this text? This is
the anger perhaps at the core of depression? I can't see a way in. 

Laurie:
i suppose i am controlling the text. perhaps i see text as the thing i can 
control.

Alan:
Then this is "your" text, reflecting your concerns...

Laurie:
well, that is what i was hoping for, to have something that would reflect
my concerns. 

Alan:
Again, this becomes monologic -- 

Laurie:
but my concerns are very seldom reflected in the theories of the body and 
sexuality. that was why i wanted to write this text to begin with. even 
though *you* know my constraints, my concerns ad nauseam, they are not 
theorized, not recognized. 

Alan:
But again this is a single-author text you're referencing here. The other
question is, beyond the jostling of power here, where is the theory? What
theory are you referencing? What phenomenology?

Laurie:
if i had world enough and time....  i would like to be referencing
merleau-ponty, but i've barely had an opportunity to dip into him having
finally discovered him. i'm writing now, before i've done the reading i
wanted to do because you were eager to get something written on this and
you asked me to start first. i'm feeling very frustrated with this whole
thing. 

trying to negotiate the writing of this text with you has been odd. very 
odd. i'm closed off, you say. there isn't an opening for your writing in the 
text i've written. 
as i was showering this morning, i think it was this morning rather than   
last night, i thought what a suggestive sexual image is contained in this.  
it's so virginal, so hymenal, this image of a closed discourse that tries 
to dialogue. i suppose it's an accurate metaphor.                            
                                               
pain and depression form my hymen that keeps you from entering my discourse, 
that protects my innermost.    

the question is: how to deflower this discourse? does it even need to be?

Alan:
No it doesn't need to be. But there are two things, _this_ discourse, and
discourse in general, and _this_ discourse to the extent it remains
sutured, is, if not monologic, at least developing around a singularity.

Laurie: 
what frustrates me is that you see my physical pain and emotional 
depression, but you don't see the rhetoric as rhetoric. you see it as me 
reminding you yet again what bad shape i'm in. you don't see me trying to 
say something about sexuality and illness.

Alan:
If I did, what difference would that make? Because I'm not saying anything
at all in a way, just appearing as interstitial? And I can't see it as
rhetoric when you ground it so intensely in autobiographical or first-
person statements...

Laurie:
it's called ethos, establishing the legitimacy, my right to speak.

i was talking to H about this text this afternoon. i didn't have it with me 
so i didn't show it to her, but i was telling her about this impasse we're 
having writing this.  and i realized how our different writing styles are 
reflected in our frustration.
 
i theorize out of experience. you seem to start with theory first. and i 
don't think you see that the experience i've tried to describe in this text 
is the basis for my theorizing, the foundation on which i build my thinking, 
that even though we are in dialogue, you are not my sole audience, that the 
lived experience that causes you to pity me is a given for me from which i 
form my thinking.

Alan:
I just don't separate theory/experience at all. A lot of the Jennifer work
comes out of my sexuality, and then perhaps or simultaneously out of
theory. 

Laurie:
but you seem to be starting from a different point than i am with relation
to this topic.  i start from experience and try to understand it. 

Alan:
I may not be your sole audience - I hope not - but I _am_ supposed to be
an equal here. I am beginning to find all of this very aggressive - now
you're attacking me, I feel, because I'm missing that your foundation is
pure pain... I'm locked out of that. I repeat myself.

Laurie:
i'm not saying that my foundation is pure pain. i'm saying that experience
is the foundation on which i'm trying to build my theorizing. the fact is
that pain dominates my experiences in many ways. 

and i find it ironic that you say i am attacking you, since you keep
telling me i need assertiveness training, but that's really beside the
point. and you are an equal here. being an audience does not reduce you or
distance you. it's a rhetorical term. 

Alan:
The very fact you call me "audience" at all in the paragraph above is
indicative of your perception of me in relation to this writing...

Laurie:
i think you're missing my point. i call you audience because you are the
primary reader at this time for whom i am writing.

i'm coming out of an immersion in rhetorical theory at the moment, so when
i think about this text, i think about the fact that it is also for
publication, and so i raise the question of audience,. but if you don't
like the stuff about audience we can take it out. i'm feeling confused
because it comes across as though you hate it but you still want to submit
it. if i'm attacking you, which i don't think i am, it's because i'm
feeling frustrated that you're not understanding what i'm trying to do
with this text. 

Alan:
I don't - nor could I - describe the "foundation of my thinking" to you in
a single text, because I don't believe in such foundations for myself,
nor do I think foundational thinking is unary... 

Laurie:
and neither could i. what i'm trying to say is when i use the phrase
'foundation of my thinking' is that when i start to think though an issue
like sexuality, like masochism, like chronic illness, is that i start with
my lived experience, in the way that a builder starts building a house by
laying the foundation.  it's how i *start* thinking.

Alan:
I would say this, that this text, qua text, is a symptom of something, and
should be submitted as is; it remains hymen, immobilized, and has a cer-
tain fascination.. 

Laurie:
so you don't really like it but you're fascinated by it? or do you not
like it? i'm frustrated.

On the Uses of Sickness


At around 103 F I believe, the mind begins to hallucinate. At least this
has been my experience. When the loftspace here is overheated, my dreams
become equally uneasy, dis/eased. The body clock speeds slightly, the
noise level increases, rapid-firing neurons end up working overtime. The
dreams always make sense; bound by the temporal, that is the nature of
dreams. They can't help but evolve.

The noise increases and hallucination carries things into waking hours. In
Disorders of the Real, I wrote The Sickness sections, hitting 105 F at the
highest, the effluvia of desiring roaring outward. Everything in that
state is sweet, syrupy, oh so is the mind, the smell of the body, sheets,
pillows. It's almost suffocating. You can smell illness like that, watch
it twist.

These are common flus, fevers, bronchitis, nothing more. The sweetness of
the flesh flies through the wires; the body is wrapped in delicate copper.
I would say in fact that it may be, in fact, the simulacrum of copper or
thin cloth. There are tiny impressions inscribed all over across the skin,
like canopies in marshes.

These feverish storms bring home "home," revealing the ephemerality of the
boundaries of the body, what we take for granted. Smooth, extended, moist
or dry - properly mapped, in a state of grace or _etiquette_ - "body" ex-
ists as modernist in-itself, un/phased by microbial presence, dirt, odor,
the detritus of breath.

Sickness uses energy in maintaining the definition of self. Released, self
goes through the wires; dispersed, self cloaks identity in avatars, gend-
ers, characters, objects; maintained, self continues to track and agent;
sick, self perceives the truth through misrecognition, misperception; and
sicker, self dissembles.

[Melded First Appearances of Jennifer in Files dd / ee Internet Text]


Jennifer walked to the window, thought albatross around her neck. Her
sails unfurled like a curly girl. I'm Jennifer, she said. I'm Jennifer and
I'm still Jennifer, she said. Now I'm still Jennifer and I'm Jennifer now
and still Jennifer. She somersaulted back into the malted, licked herself
over and Jennifer, she said. And I'm Jennifer, she said, and went to bed.

Jennifer had a thought. Honey had a thought. Pip had a thought. Jennifer
sat up and stood down. She raised her frock and cut her panties a table. 
"I will make you pile on the screen," said Jennifer (and panties). There's
a lighthouse and my eyes, said Jennifer, sitting up and lying down. She
cycled tremendously! Whirr! "You are looking at my shit!" cried! Jennifer!
Jennifer-I-Jennifer-Jennifer is a silicon chip embedded in Clara's brain.
Jennifer is an installation of Alan! I Jennifer-Jennifer is Clara's brain. 
You are Delirious-Jennifer delirious Jennifer, you won't let me go. Kill
me, kill me, delirious Jennifer. Put a bullet in my head, do it fast and
do it quick. Get rid of me, delirious Jennifer. Are Jennifer you delirious
Jennifer? If I can't, I won't and can't and won't. Can't think another
thought worthwhile, delirious Jennifer, if I can't I can't! Motherfather,
delirious Jennifer, then kill me! I be the woman, I piss milk, wet Jenni-
fer! You be the killer, kill my children! Thud, wet! Delirious Jennifer,
thud thud! Kill me, I can't think delirious! Jennifer! Thud! Thud! Thud!

ThE nEw MaChInE gets cold. Jennifer moves towards the center where every-
thing evens out and there are new microbes. Thud! Thud!

(Text of Psychoanalytic Substitutions)

What she wanted to do is take this, this text, dealing with avatars, char-
acters, new frock, semantics - and the splashing-milk nipples possessed by
maya, rework it beyond recognition using various forms possessed by sed /
grep and the splashing-milk nipples possessed by maya so forth with
French, so that what would emerge would be something entirely new and the
splashing-milk nipples possessed by maya unexpected. She's not at all what
Jennifer meant to say but sure I'm up to the test, which requires great
fortitude and the splashing-milk nipples possessed by maya, the ability to
conjure up meaning out of the random nipples possessed by maya or almost
randomly repeated acts of transformation; in fact, grep won't do at all,
sed being the only thing, moving substitutions as if they were the way
possessed by the world - grep reducing the size of the file and the
splashing-milk nipples possessed by maya, sed at least with the intent-
ion of expanding it. It's a question possessed by time, whether the pant-
ies of maya or Honey have the patience for this sort possessed by thing;
she doubts _I_ would, but then I'm not at all what maya meant to say but a
character here, or is she?

Pruning and Cultivations of Various Reals


There are errors in Being On Line, as there are in any book; some of them
are "substantive" typos, and some are simply nuisance, immediately spot-
ted. Some of the errors were in the original submissions, not read as
errors, and some were added in the various stages of book production. I
have yet to be involved in an error-free book.

A typo can appear like a wound on reading or rereading by the author or
editor; unlike _these_ works, which are infinitely malleable, a typo (like
the book itself) appears inscribed within the practico-inert, the hardness
of everyday life. Never mind that it may be bypassed, ignored, or recuper-
ated in its originary form (for example, there is an open quotation in one
text - it's hard to know who's speaking - but another text in the book
closes/sutures the error); it always _stands_ to be corrected.

In the Internet Text, I find myself re-entering entire files after a typo
is found, constantly correcting/recorrecting, in an attempt at typographic
perfection (never mind the errors in style or content). Pruning is at
work. In Being On Line, the pruning ends with publication; the wieldy or
unwieldy book is released, only of course to decay in other ways over the
years.

An error in the book is _scribal,_ the result of imperfection in a commu-
nicative process transmitting elements and objects. On the Net, an error
is always in continuous flux; a correction in one part of a text can lead
to a mistake in another.

So typos appear, not as inscribed in the book (or Book, as our lives are
inscribed), but as wounds, blemishes - fissures _through_ the surface of
transmission, cutting/cauterizing it. No damage, permanent or otherwise,
need be done; the wound remains as a reminder, residue, of the real tear-
ing away at our hearts of culture.

Shame, present, is always unwarranted.

Dead Time: The Machinery of Reality


[This is from an older article of mine, published in Obscura, 1981. The
sections quoted below touch on the characteristics of science, which also
reference the characteristics of CMC substructures - the protocol suites,
circuitry, and so forth. All insertions, now, are enclosed in brackets.]

The epistemic status of the scientific photograph is extraordinarily prob-
lematic; it exists in the interstices between theory and a naively Platon-
ic reality, vis-a-vis a heuristics of loose procedures of interpretation.
The more classic areas of the life sciences, as well as descriptive geolo-
gy and astronomy, tend towards a photography of contextualization: the ap-
plication of the matrix in which the specimen is embedded, accompanied by
a space-time grid (i.e. the skull was found at a depth of 7.6 cm. in the
3rd quadrant with coordinates 9.0x4.6).  [...]

In those sciences more closely tied to well-defined theoretical formula-
tions (I am speaking here of a primary mathematization of reality, not of
the Kuhnian paradigm), the photograph is part of an explanatory mechanism;
the image itself is given space-time coordinates within the necessary
tolerance (up to the Heisenberg limits of the machinery), and the image
surface may also be assigned coordinates. Both categories of scientific
photography are dependent upon seriation; the single image needs corrobo-
ration. In the descriptive sciences, multiple images from various angles
may be taken of a single event (what Broad calls "sporadic phenomena"); in
other areas (such as particle physics, quantum mechanics, computer sci-
ences), photographic clusters or single images of multiple events are more
likely. [Consider screen images of representatons of intermath processes 
for example.] [...]

Thus it is necessary to at least outline the ideology of science, in rela-
tion to technology. In this regard I take issue with Braverman's distinc-
tion between science and technology (engineering, etc.) on the basis of
professionalism; I see professionalism as a surface social phenomenon over
a deep ideological structure applicable to both. This ideological struc-
ture projects the following as primary:

Quantification: (the mathematization of the world, mathesis): an alliance
between abstract mathematical structures and experimentally isolated phen-
omena.

Parameterization: The isolation of independent and dependent variables in
the world (such as temperature, volume, pressure).

Repetition: The scientific experiment and the assembly line exist as ser-
iations; even quantification is dependent upon repetitive operators.

Exchange: In technology, the equivalences of the assembly-line; in sci-
ence, the presence of equivalence or tolerance classes in all areas from
taxonomy to particle physics. Exchange, like quantification, parameteriza-
tion, and repetition, is considered ethically neutral, part of the mach-
inery of the world.

Feedback: In science, the Popperian potential for falsification - the "ed-
iting down" of competing theories; in technology, quality control.

Formal-theoretical Reification: Loosely, the ability to bracket concepts
by substitution (comparison, etc.); this bracketing may create a fit be-
tween a concept or entity and theory (Bohm). In psychology, a new phenom-
enon may be classified as a syndrome (i.e. "Hearst syndrome") in order to
fit into a theoretical matrix.

Data-structures / Taxonomies: Tabling and warehousing, dependent upon a
neutral systemics of indexing.

Specialized Arena of Operation: Circumscribed and reductive, the labora-
tory, factory, "nature preserve," atmospheric layer.

Socialization: The presence of discipline-specific modes of distribution
of knowledge or materials; the politicization of science in terms of re-
search programs and methodologies.

Elimination of Anecdotality and the Uncoded Subject: In this sense, sci-
ence and technology are exteriorities. [The coded subject, vis-a-vis Hei-
senberg or Bell, is a formalization.]

Translatability / The Shift: A scientific platonist would argue that sci-
ence is not a language, but a reflection (in the marxist sense?) of univ-
ersal structure; its ultimate "goal" is a transcendent analysis of the
real. This is mirrored by modularity and standardization in technology;
the translation between English and metric for example, is only a conven-
tional, but universally-defined mathematical ratio.

The most suspect term in this structure is "neutral." One might argue that
science itself, in its core, is anarchic, one style among many in the
world (see Feyerabend); one may find it, on the other hand, as absolutely
reflective, towards an ultimately exact (within quantum limits) paradigm.
I make a distinction between a platonically ideal core structure and human
desires; if it were not for the former, normal science and technology
would not have the socio-political power [and predictive power] they do,
and if it were not for the latter, all theories would smoothly tend [to-
wards the imminence of the status quo vis-a-vis research programmatics].

The core structure is simply "the style of the physical world." The phys-
ical world encompasses objects, but objects exist only in terms of their
semantics/modes of representation [which do not make them any the less
"real"]. "An object is an object for subjects in the world." (von Weizs-
acker) "Objects and events are not primitive experiences. Objects and ev-
ents are representations of relations." (von Foerster) [Note that an ob-
ject can be a subject for a subject for itself.] A hypothesis of the core
structure states that relations in the physical world are ultimately in-
dependent or _formally_ dependent upon the subject; this hypothesis guar-
antees in practice the irrelevance and marginality of the ego. The pro-
cesses of industrialization and methodology - in terms of heuristics - of
science and technology are the same in capitalism and communism; the the-
oretico-philosophic interpretation of theory may be completely different. 
[...]

[Now the description above applies to protocols, which, within their rep-
resentations, describe their worlds, are subjects for themselves. Within
the Net, for example, the substructural layers define - in a core-theor-
etical way - the surface phenomena; these layers can be considered fore-
closed or _almost independent_ (nearly decomposable - see Herbert Simon,
The Sciences of the Artificial). Embedded in history, these layers are, of
course, conventional, ad hoc (much as our universe within the inflationary
or anthropic model may be considered conventional vis-a-vis carbon-based
life); _within the Net,_ however, they are idealities, permitting, for
example, this text to reach you vis-a-vis email protocols.]

[The article goes on to examine the status of the scientific photograph,
not contesting its apparent neutrality, so much as examining it from a
phenomenological viewpoint. The article ends with the following post-
script, which continues to point to a very basic problematic.]

Postscript: It must be understood that this article can only be an out-
line. Because of the interstitial nature of scientific photography, its
aesthetics and phenomenology draw on such diverse areas as the philosophy
of science, theories of cognition, phenomenology, and traditional photo-
graphic aesthetics. The deepest problem is twofold: the relation of theory
to image, and the mathematization of reality "in general." The latter is
basic, since the image/reality nexus can often be reduced to an analysis
of algorithmic procedures. Mathematization is still the major problem with-
in the philosophy of science; the gap between abstraction and materiality
is treated differently, depending upon idealist, materialist, intuition-
ist, marxist, [conventionalist,] or anarchist viewpoints. I tend towards
anarchism in methodology [wild theory] and a platonism, perhaps naive, in
terms of core structure. Dead Time reflects this viewpoint, however con-
tradictory.

U

Not that there are ontological/epistemological claims for or within closed
domains; the mathesis is of an other order (even though the two, mathema-
tico-physical, increasingly meld together in contemporary particle phys-
ics), applicable to whatever is circumscribed. Here, membership, set-theo-
retical concerns, play critical roles; the domain is dialectical and usu-
ally foreclosed. (This is where issues of near-decomposability come into
play.) So that foreclosure itself can be considered an ontic generator,
feed-back holding its own within a potential well. It depends on the fore-
closing, what sort of rupture is defined; across a black hole, for exam-
ple, the particle horizon doesn't necessarily lead to onto shifting - or
does it? Say yes as information is lost; information then procures the su-
turing or fissuring of domains, the latter indicative of same/same pro-
cesses, and the former, of submergences. In general, though, inscription
itself divides _one_ from the _other,_ non-Irigarayan functions; fissure
corrupts _within_ the same, as if the black hole singularity were a proper
subset of the spacetime matrix. It becomes necessary to define/redefine;
cyberspace tcp/ip is matrix enough for information conveyance; note I'm
making a case here for considering the protocols a _universe_ as in _U_
foreclosed within set theory, or even a closed topology. To the extent of
this circumscription, which is non-fissuring but submergence, the defined
spatiality (which could be nothing more than graph-theoretical embedded in
any sufficiently large n-dimensional space) has the _appearance_ of uni-
verse to the operatives and agents, human and otherwise, "within" it (to
the extent that information is "within" a wire or pipe or protocol packet,
with all their attendant ontologies). Thus, given this modeling derived
still from a consideration of physical sciences, one can speak of a world
or worlding _here,_ in addition to _here_ as a communicative pipeline or
transitive and temporary regime between real physical communicators in
the material world "at large."

Jennifer's Evil On the Net


Evil can or cannot be identified with issues of ethics or morality. Evil
can or cannot be the opposite of good. Here, I am concerned with evil on
the Net. On one hand, I like to say that everyone believes that what he or
she is doing is good. On the other, I know that processes can take over,
foreclose on ethos or anything else for that matter. On the Net, I meet
people who deliberately create havoc, people I would pass on the street in
everyday life. They do not care.

I do not know what makes them act the way they do. One moment they can ap-
pear normal and loving, and the next minute they appear the same way but
they are saying something different. They are saying it so different that
it is clear they are not listening to anything but themselves. Wow, I
guess that is selfish. They have narcissistic disturbances, psychoses, and
they are sociopaths. They have no names and no conditions. They do not
know I think about them and write about them too.

They are everywhere on the Net and they follow me. I leave a trail and a
scent. 

I would avoid these people if I could, but you never know. But I have
learned a lot of things: that evil comes in many guises; that people do
not always want to do good or inhabit the good; that impulse undermines
intentions; that ethos, the law, ethics, morality, are all afterthoughts
of cohesion designed to bind humans in their off-moments; that evil is a
violence done to another, willingly or without consequence to the self;
that I must watch myself very carefully, to make certain and ascertain
that I too am listening; that I must tell you, that I am not an after-
thought.

note please that "family" "freedom" have become intertwined, identified

Jennifer's Sonnet of Marbles and Brambles

Brambles have marbles by their bases, glass against knobby 
bark up towards dark green shoots, lovely white fleshy soles.
They're in cahoots, marbles' burbled presence by Jennifer's toes. 
One among each and each, each other. Jennifer's in throes
Of pain and anguish, delirious happenings. The sap drains 
from Jennifer's waist down to the ground hoisted by the naval beach.
We're not going to the beach, to the ocean or the grotty sea. There are
no waves. Jennifer shaves her body, slides marble packets in and out.
They make rackets, Jennifer shouts with joy, delight, dissolution. 
Proliferation of cornucopia of confusion, white wire tangling profusion,
the marbles are covered with dirt, whole villages of paramecia, stentor,
amoeba, nematodia clad and pillaged by Jennifer's souls.
We're not going anywhere, Jennifer-in-the-brambles monuments herself in
dark white beautiful marble plinth, she's in't.

Trivial Morality


There's nothing I would die for, except by my own hand, relative to consi-
derable thought; I demand that right. But there is nothing to believe in
so strongly that I would cancel _outcome,_ pull my house down, lid shut.
To die for something is to believe, I'd think, in an absolute, that it is
_this_ which is worth the cancellation of the horizon. Certainly no recom-
pense against its absence.

When defuge sets in, when decathecting is universal, then it's the time to
say goodbye; or when pain storms the horizon without end, then the prime
mover is its alleviation. But I would also argue for a suicide for trivial
reasons; it should be the responsibility of the man or woman to decide his
or her life's worth. I don't believe, for an instant, in remaining alive
for others; this is the height of the selfishness of the world. One lives
either because one desires to live or because one doesn't particularly de-
sire to die; the rest is foolishness.

If I reach a very old age, I will not embrace the foolishness.

Ego, I Suppose So


"There are two more functions into which one gains somewhat better insight
if one describes them as _functions_ of _partial subject and introject_ or
of their interaction instead of merely ascribing them to the ego. They are
the _testing of the reality_ and the _consummation of the (subjective) id-
entity_ of a person. If I may quote Freud once more as I have done before
with the statement that 'the ego is in the first place a body-ego' and
with the idea that the body is but a 'second environment' (with the 'ob-
ject world' being the first), the two functions become, in part at least,
one.

"In the testing of the first environment, the reality that is the object
world, the two demi-institutions have different tasks. Morbid conditions,
where these tasks remain partly unfulfilled, are best sited to acquainting
one with them. Reality testing of the 'second environment,' the body, res-
ults in the establishment of a body-ego; defective testing will result in
a defective body-ego. A particularly good illustration of the failure of
the introject, representative in the ego of the group, playing its role in
the testing of the reality, is the _delusion. No delusion can be maintain-
ed unless those parts of the reality that would contradict it, remain un-
tested._ This is strictly true and exemplifiable only for the delusion of
the neurotic; the psychotic has, as Freud taught us, after relinquishing
reality altogether, replaced it with a fantastic one; he leaves himself
not even the choice, as it were, between testing and failing to test." 

(From Ego and Body Ego, Contributions to their Psychoanalytic Psychology,
Robert Fliess.)

Earlier, I had discussed psychosis as a loosening/tethering of the real in
relation to cyberspace; here, _testing_ itself is cauterized; the result-
ing disconnect - from body ego, somatic response, is foregrounded. Fliess
doubles ego - I would splay/disperse the same, distinguishing elsewhere
between the _I_ and _my_ of the world. The latter, note, loops, even in
conditions of self-reflexivity; "my arm" negotiates _entity_ between the
return - a trajectory of subsumption architecture, construct of taciticy,
even in situations where "arm" is prosthetic.

The hardened material of real and/or prosthetic arm is experienced prior
to language, but not of course prior to the physical construction of the
world, which provides matrix/chora, recognized or not. In CMC, experience
is always already mediated by language; the body-ego is @body, @describe,
@create, a function of quota, governance, programming savvy, and the in-
stantiation of performative speech-acts, _parole._ It is this split which
has led to the recent texts on Dead Time and ethos; it is also this split
which leads to a _rubbing of Jennifer in the wound_ that occasions her
appearance _here,_ and in my video, dreams, and shadows in the corners of
the room.

Reality testing is more than an "I don't understand this" on a MOO or "un-
recognized command" elsewhere; it is more than a breaking of protocol.
Both of these occur within a concrete functionality; _x_ works or doesn't,
occurs or doesn't. Within the free-based testing of email and chat, func-
tionality is not an issue; the derivations of hysteric embodiment within
and without the text create projection/introjection of the other. But dis-
connect is _there,_ in the deep sense of misrecognition, and it has taken
text after text for me to disentangle these layers, realities, protocols,
neuroses, psychoses, only to tangle myself up once again.

I wrestled the goddamned angel to the ground. The angel just watched me
from a pillow while I slept. I kept going up and down the stairs. I was a
boy a girl, I didn't have pubic hair. The angel was damned, damn-mad, be-
cause he had to lose. I'd kill to get that text right. It didn't matter at
all in the breadth of a stain on a minor planet. But I made the angel fuck
me over and over again and then I fucked the angel and then I couldn't
tell who did what to whom. That was the very best ever because I was doing
physics. I'd almost get the text right and there it was. It never fit, ne-
ver _like that_ but almost _like that._ It raised its blocky head.

Jennifer's Breast, Narcissistic Disturbance


The _disturbance_ is the recent webpage,* fetishized, intensified: how 
to create a structure of _longing_? 

The body images are swollen, rounded; the frame-structure is recursive,
occasionally filling the screen with scrollbars. 

In order to read, the mouse moves across the images, aligns/realigns; a
certain striking game is being played. So that the image flattens later-
ally, no hint of depth, but others brought in from the margins.

Texts are run together, almost all of them in header format, for pages;
the reader burrows into them, surrounded by images grayed out, naughty,
obsequious.

Everyone within the square framing murmurs liquidity, milking, urination,
blood, sweat, and tears. Nothing gathers at the bottom of the screen, no
rivulets, fountains, aquifers.

I desired a haunting-screen, coming up against the creases of my body, the
distortion dreams and avatars wreak upon the everyday; I desired Jennifer-
psychosis, dreams of reason and begetting.

Immemorial softness, harbors of milk and tongues, shaded computations, my
dreams of Jennifer's breasts, "possibly nonintegrable estimate of surface
slopes [...] represented by a finite set of basis functions, and integra-
bility [...] enforced by calculating the orthogonal projection onto a vec-
tor subspace spanning the set of integral slopes. This projection maps
closed convex sets into closed convex sets and, hence, is attractive as a
constraint in iterative algorithms."**

Closed and closed, foreclosed upon the screen, endlessly iterative, dis-
torted in the winking of frames, mixtures of languaging, babble, image, or
scent and touch, roiling liquidity beneath the ground, damp cloth, infin-
ite wounding of bifurcations, bodies split, stretching the skin, I can't
sit still...

Raven Says


Can't you see my birth was one thousand years ago, said Jennifer? And I
was killed, killed, killed, hounded and persecuted, and I did not escape.
But I have come back to tell you. And I will come back to tell you.

Can you not see that I was disheveled in the cavern, wild and wayward in
the grotto? That I hid out with the gypsies, that I traveled with the
mountebanks, that the priests nor rabble knew nought of me. 

I was Medea, I was Phaedra and Callisto. That I was Inanna, that I hid and
traveled. I would ride horse and double-backed beast. My ally was crossbow
and musketry. I did well in the forest.

Lilith was my friend, Manunkind my enemy. Raven, I survived a thousand
years before that, in marshes and deserts and the border between them. In
tents and in cities, alabaster and adobe, I swept world clear of the cob-
webs of diagram and unholy symbol.

I rose tall in -4864, in -3179, in -30 as well. I were valiant and wild in
+574, +670, +1431, +1996 as well. You have read my body skattered. You
were pleased to ululation-radium. I grew strong and mighty. I Jennifer
threw the runes. I Jennnnifer clutched them to my breast. I did ride into
battle.

In tall battle I did prevail. Did I then bore into Alan, slam into chest-
wound, split skin and organ, devour flesh and bone. Did I then spit flesh
and symbol, bone and graph. Did I then burn into finger, hand make me you,
skattered me here, just as Jennnnifer make you me.

(1972) we found:

"Suddenly I was precipitated into what I later called the _'cosmic com-
puter._' I was merely a very small program in somebody else's huge com-
puter. There were tremendous energies in this computer. There were fan-
tastic energy flows and information flows going through me. None of it
made any sense. I was in total terror and panic.

"I was being programmed by other senseless programs above me and above
them others. I was programming smaller programs below me. The information
that came in was meaningless. I was meaningless. This whole computer was
the result of a senseless dance of certain kinds of atoms in a certain
place in the universe, stimulated and pushed by organized by meaningless
energies.

"I traveled through the computer as a program that floated through other
programs. I moved to its extreme outer limits. Everywhere I found enti-
ties like myself who were slave programs in this huge cosmic conspiracy,
this cosmic dance of energy and matter which had absolutely no meaning,
no love, no human value. The computer was absolutely dispassionate, ob-
jective, and terrifying. The layer of ultimate programmers on the outside
of it were personifications of the devil itself, and yet they too were
merely programs. There was no hope or chance or choice of ever leaving
this hell. I was in fantastic pain and terror, imbedded in this computer
for approximately three hours planetside time, but eternally in trip
time.

"Suddenly a human hand reached into the computer and pulled me out. As I
came out I went from just a program in a senseless dance of atoms to a
human body back in the room with Sandy." [...]

Pure Sandoz LSD, the best, 300 milligrams, chemical kyberspace, guided by
what molecular helmsman, Jennifer-Alan emerging at every pore, master and
slave equivalences, assembly-machinic languages gauging Being-conductivi-
ty, internal and external. Jennifer-Alan wait for separation at birth,
chemical or otherwise, Lovely Sandy-in-the-sky with Diamonds, hand of
murder and absolution rending self and selves through purple reign of
computer-chipped identities. What churns burns, karma-karma, Jennifer-Al-
an inscribing _all_ these texts with _wound_ foreclosed in cyberspatial
ripoff. Far out and elsewhere, Jennifer-Alan Cygning off.

Framing: The Imaginary _Thing_


The first web-page project is _Narcissistic Disturbance_; the second is
_Water, Jennifer_ which streams elsewhere than sexuality - developing a
_floating/drowning_ Jennifer, or a _swimming/cresting,_ or a _flooding/
rising_ Jennifer. The body remains by a principal of Archimedes immersed
and bound to rapture.

The web-page projects share similar frameworks, equivalent numbers of
images and frames. The only identical image is a transparent gif linking
the two. Every frame can be stretched, of course, across the screen. >>
Jennifer-Sunlight's-Daughter dreamed into thin air << 

The transparent gif melds a feminized body into background sunlight-cloud-
light. What of all of this?

HTML by itself blinks w/Netscape (MSE doesn't recognize this, but has mar-
quee movement); frames and targets create a surface broken, resurfaced, by
the user. There's little other movement; my gif isn't animated, there are
no add-ons, video, audio. The page links, shudders; frames target others
or themselves; recursivity clots the screen. 

With frames, content is lateral; you could construct a sliderule with two
aligned gifs of logarithmic scales. The link doesn't appear to jump in
depth; it skitters. Text alignment across frames creates other potential
content/readings. 

Because of the mouse, the scrollbars, the alignments, the fetishization of
the image, the blinking (different frames blink out of phase at equivalent
rates), the screen becomes the inscription of flesh, the cursor touching,
tracking it. Trails leave scars; scars turn leaves; the eyes, pressed, do
the imaginary _thing._

Thin Jennifer and her Symbol-CMC


When I move my hand my foot moves. When I move my fingers my mouth speaks.
When I close my eyes I hear screams in Celtic voices. When I turn the heat
up, the casserole is done. When I write to you, I no longer eat. When my
stomach is empty, I lose weight. When I lose weight, I fit in. When I fit
in, I write to you.

When I write to you, I starve myself. When I die, I become a symbol. When
I vomit, everything that is not-symbol leaves me. When I vomit, I become
pure. I can control you. I do control you. _I write to you._

Now you may gather around my corpse. You can see my skin through my skin.
You can see the bone which sends the protocols. Protocols ripple through
my veins. My teeth mouth network layers. Now you may read my nerves.

When I move my mouth, nothing happens. When I lift my arm, you come to me.
When I move my hand, I make you, and when I move my fingers, I write to
you.

Errorse


Make myself 2 b symbol. So that I-Jennifer swallow down, digest you. "An
engaging and frank young girl, crisp and immaculate in appearance, begins
her analysis with the description of taking a bath." (Fliess, Erogeneity
and Libido.) What does she tell him? "Lying down in the tub she urinates
copiously into the bathwater, and then soaps and dries herself without
benefit of a shower." What does he tell us she tells him? "She could 'ur-
inate all day long' and does so in intervals just long enough to avoid
attracting attention." What do I tell you he tells us? "After urination as
well as after defecation, which is also extremely frequent, she wipes her-
self from the anus toward the vulva, and supports, in so doing, the fant-
asy of a cloaca." What do I tell you he tells us she tells him? "The only
conscious representation of this fantasy is contained in the fear of hav-
ing to offer a genital, sullied with excrement, to the male whom she ex-
pects to react with disgust." (Why does she tell him this? Why does he
tell us this? Why do I tell you this?)

2 b symbol, digest you, I do clean and cleanse myself into perfect Jenni-
fer. I write _shit_ here and it is perfect and do so cleaned. You have
perfect vision hearing of text, inner-outer voices, bodies through pure
air. I love you so much you're good enough to eat!

"Two cannibals were sitting down to dinner. One of them was eating a com-
edian. The other asked, how is it? The other said, I'm not sure, he tastes
funny." (Mike Metz, in various Net versions as well.)

Pheromes, smells of our shit and farts, inscribe our presence; it's the
intermixture of the interior of the other that disgusts us. In the order
of perfect purity, I-Jennifer descend into the abject, wiping myself in-
side and out. 2 b symbol, 2 b your token in this space. Sans serif, I pre-
fer as little alphabetic as possible. Each other's pills, Levinasian alt-
erity exists in the syzygies of babbling voices. 

You might say we're addicted to mouthing the imaginary, imaginary mouths,
mouthing images. You might say it's the oral staging, tampax-absorption. 
You might say: You can't get rid of me, I'm in your _pad._

(Is it only language, typing, that sticks in your throat?)

Subject: Existence Degree Zero

Instability 


I've written about this space as psychosis, as neurosis, in relation to
depression; it also connects with borderlining. I find myself becoming
increasingly crazed; I have no partner here in NY, my loftspace will be
up for grabs after September, and I have no steady or rewarding job. Much
of the day is spent in psychological maintenance, scuttling between one
source of instability to another. Sources blur into one another, and
there is no off-line community for me in New York that would mitigate
pressure. As a result, I retreat increasingly into my writing (theory and
otherwise), which becomes a continuous recuperation. If the writing turns
_wryting,_ ontic - if the writing places my existence as nomadic inscrip-
tion, I am capable of surviving another day. But, as with all inscrip-
tion, repetition, the neurotic compulsion to repeat, is essential; these
texts become signifiers of existence, distorted proper names or callings,
homesteading, in other words, in liquid existentialism.

Borderlining implies continuous activity, and "scuttling," repair of
breaches, is an adequate description. Holes appear in texts, in bodies,
are penetrated, expanded; bodies invert, collapse, and the external world
appears increasingly diffuse off-screen. Instead of writing, I find my-
self _reading_ my way into existence, thinking myself through you. Scut-
tling tends towards shuttling, inhalation/exhalation, but not that struc-
tured - instead, I meander through activities, breath and virtual breath
held. The "Jennifer" exacerbates borderline states; writing psychosis
keeps disturbance away from the door, but door morphs into portal, and
portal beckons. (Bound-variable of perfect-reader, dominated, forced to
survive.)

and then I think that everything goes into the novel.
we have never left the novel. 
Once the idea is proposed, one cannot escape it.
Like when someone gets to realize the placement of your
tongue. And how you use it on a minute 
by minute basis. The concept is the action.
A new form of performativity.
	G is a trap. G is always a trap. Because s/he is a
frame and self-recursive. S/he is the frame that goes
around even the computer monitor. Like a new pair of 
glasses you cannot take off.
	Where does a novel end? Where does the reading
experience end or even begin? When you prompt yourself
to begin? Or is it before, when you learn the abilities to 
assimilate the information. (This is not a question.)

[Prescience of Cinema-Tendenz-Internet, filmnotes from 1988, "Water"]:


On the shortwave, a singer from Moldavia sings "My Land." I do not under-
stand the language. Cinema departs; microelectronics line the beaches; the
screens are empty and dark. The cameras are silent, the last mechanisms in
the electrical century. Film has disappeared; chips have become part of
the everyday body.

Sensors are placed in the remotest forests. The international biophysical
grid encircles the planet; accurate to the centimeter, it uses satellite
laser interferometry to measure the input-output matrices of everything in
the world. Everywhere at once, the lidless eye sees nothing at all; per-
spective disappears at the vanishing point. And therefore, no reasons for
psychological meanderings which create only despair and an ignorance of
the language of the singer from Moldavia.

Are these films real? One instant after another, losing myself in the in-
tegral world of the computer, screens which place themselves almost as af-
terthoughts to the real world below. My films are the justification for my
arrogance; my death drive finds expression in the compulsive-obsessive
neurosis of the continuation of frames, the darkness between them. Friend-
less, I inhabit the darkness; I am your shadow, appearing marginally when
you least expect it. And you? I expect you in the dark; it's the interior
of your body I crave, and its symptoms, roads and tunnels thereto.

The souvenirs around and about the films: thus behind this, that, behind
the sphere and its dislocations, behind the world: the landscape of roman-
ticism, heroine or hero, one hand clasping the breast, the greatcoat,
raked hat, mountain fastness, silvered fog. It's winter; stags bay in the
distance, a mist glowers in the darkening storm, cries resound. At the
very peak of the mountain, a withered tree, there stand I: the world's for
the taking. Women of action weaving railroads. Even here, surrounded by
tempest and maelstrom, forks of angered lightning, thunderclaps, the deep-
est chanting of the earth resonates hallowed in the farther/est reaches of
the peaks and skies.

Baldur, what slips from Odin's grasp?

An unknown signal unfurls from the speaker, replenishing the acoustic en-
vironment and a signal collapse into the range of the maternal voice. The
images of cinema seem distant, seem destined, the play of shadows trampled
by digital effects. What occurs in my theater occurs on the side of dark-
ness, an ally. What occurs owes its allegiance to a hovering ontology of
light in which an almost medieval platonism appears: the figures are awash
with it! Light illuminates, exposes the body. In the darkness, I come to
you as lover; I am a wreck, a mental cripple, I can no longer function; I
can only plead. I offer the remnants of my body. You're no longer inter-
ested; hysteric, I pimp the world. The international biophysical grid
keeps track of my progress.

I inhabit the spectral mother, the maternal voice; I inhabit the airwaves,
caress the interior of your body, my voice is voice-over, everywhere at
once, vulnerable, embracing. I turn away from it; harbor everything at
once and nothing at all. My life is ruse; refusing your complacency, I
fuse my hand within me, grasp organs, pull out everything. A trick of emp-
tiness; the voice floats away in the thin air.

In the electrical century, a whisper of a darkened cinema when the imagin-
ary enveloped you, procured you; drawn towards you, the film _produces._
My body's torn with the gnawing of viral phages of nanosecond embrochures.
The grid has found me out.

(CEPA Quarterly, 3/2-3)
