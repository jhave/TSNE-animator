Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Okay so what's a Barbie to do, I mean?
It's like, it's like I'm the baddest Barbie in the fucking world
I mean, this is some vintage Nicki Minaj shit, throwback shit
I mean come on now it's Barbie bitch!

[RU Spits]
I don't got a dollar tonight, I'll just borrow
Please let me in I'll bring you back tomorrow
I'm tryna leave here with America's Top Model
And I ain't got to spit no game I pop bottles

[Nicki Minaj]
I ain't got a man sometimes I do borrow
Don't care about your cars, your jewels, or your cash (nope)
Make my own ends in a bubblegum Benz
I ain't feeling your style but I'll fuck your friend (whoop!)

[RU Spits]
Trick you crazy
Tryna play me
Way cooler than AC's
Your boy be cakey
Roll hard like Stake Key
Dimes embrace me
Lace me, they bring the whip cream to taste me
If I buy you a drink you gotta compensate me
Damn girl you bootyful, I mean beautiful
Me and you together ain't no telling what we could do
Flee for a week or two, you can bring your peoples too
Bullshit or not, I ain't even got a reason to
When I smoke clear my dear I'm tryna leave with chu
Slitho B's the keys, I get the vehicle
Pull up to the front
I'm a roll another blunt (whoo!)

[RU Spits]
I don't got a dollar tonight I'll just borrow
Please let me in I'll bring you back tomorrow
I'm tryna leave here with America's Top Model
And I ain't got to spit no game I pop bottles

[Nicki Minaj]
I ain't got a man sometimes I do borrow
Don't care about your cars, your jewels, or your cash (nope)
Make my own ends in a bubblegum Benz
I ain't feeling your style but I'll fuck your friend

[Nicki Minaj]
Listen play boy, boy
I don't know why you tryna play the girl like a toy, toy
I don't care 'bout your ends that you spend boy
I'm tryna holla at your friend he a ten boy
Look, you see Christian Dior on my tits
I don't care if you spit, I don't care if your name RU Spits
Nicki you still a brew chick
But I rock with cha fella like the S Dot Kidd
Niggas wanna know her but a bitch so cocky
"Miss bow for her" 'cause my wrists so rocky
Who gon' top me?
Who gon' stop me?
Nickname shippy TV that where they watch me

[RU Spits]
I don't got a dollar tonight I'll just borrow
Please let me in I'll bring you back tomorrow
I'm tryna leave here with America's Top Model
And I ain't got to spit no game I pop bottles

[Nicki Minaj]
I ain't got a man sometimes I do borrow
Don't care about your cars, your jewels, or your cash (nope)
Make my own ends in a bubblegum Benz
I ain't feeling your style but I'll fuck your friend

[RU Spits]

I need a chick that me rip right in my homie garage
You know the type?

[Nicki Minaj]

[RU Spits]

[Nicki Minaj]
Look family, I don't think you understand me
Hold on a minute tell you what the plan be
Think it's 'bout time you moved on to plan B
You can catch me, where your man be

[RU Spits]
