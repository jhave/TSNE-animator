Song:   Still Missin
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus]
My lawnmower home, but my hoe still missin
My hoe still missin, my hoe still missin
My rake in the shed, but my hoe still missin
My hoe still missin, my hoe still missin
Plowin the world but my hoe still missin
My hoe still missin, my hoe still missin
I'm 'bout to lose my head cause my hoe still missin
Like it's greener on the other side...

[Flo Rida]
I take care of the yard, everyday, I don't know why my hoe got missin
My rake in good condition, my lawnmower in position
I ain't done a damn thing wrong for my hoe to get up and get missin
Now I'd be wrong if I was to dig up the dirt I done saw for myself and witnessed
Boy I'd tell you about my hoe, never had restrictions
I guess more green was her attention, I shoulda kept that hoe in the kitchen
Got me on a mission, left my shed without permission
I'm sheddin tears messin up my vision, this hoe gon' make me go to prison

[Chorus]

[Flo Rida]
That hoe cost me my job, I'm afraid I shoulda learned mo' 'bout the business
A hoe is good for diggin, I shoulda known this from the beginnin
I done got caught slippin now I'm trippin
Out the do' somebody else found interest
On my hoe until I found out until I find out different
Better to know then have intuitions
Who been in my yard, why would anybody split us apart~?!
I never thought that hoe would get to my heart
I found out right off a bitch can't pull apart
Why this hoe went in somebody garage?
I was a gentlemen right from the start
Ever since I put the hoe in my Dodge
Now this bitch won't even spare me the rod

[Chorus]

[Flo Rida]
Seven years now it's all over, now hold on go on you gotta feel me bruh
Left my home no sign of luck, I try to drink Patron so all the memories gone
All the pain I'm trying to pour it in my cup, bought the hoe my last couple of bucks
Lost a hoe I never felt this crush, like kush in a dutch - never this much
If I woulda known my hoe was just temporary
And I ain't talkin 'bout the hoe you find in the dictionary
I feel like goin to war like the military
Somebody gon' have to visit the cemetery

[Chorus]</pre>
