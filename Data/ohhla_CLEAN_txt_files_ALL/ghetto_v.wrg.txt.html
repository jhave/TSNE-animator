[Chorus]
Would you like to go with me, down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me, to village ghetto life?

Let me tell you bout the village where I dwell, it's a...
Living hell still tryin to make a heaven outta this right here
Watching fo' the postman hopin fo' paper
Please stop the bus mister driver, wait up we got...
Rock fights where the dead end meets 
The stop lights is out so it's dead in the streets
The countyline look long, but I'm kinda hungry 
So I pack a sack lunch, and got on
Late for class again, it's half past 10
And moms gonna whoop ma ass again
Now and then I get the feelin that the world is mine
I start sittin back watchin time fly by
But uh, I'm so proud to say
That the ghetto is the reason that I'm loud today
And you come get a glimpse of what's happenin
See for yourself how it is where I live at

[Chorus]

It shouldn't take long to see, the place that belongs to me
It's all good, ain't nothin like home to me
No Diplomas but I, got some knowledge out of
My other partners that made it up outta here
And now not a whole lot of us get rich
But like the old saying goes "Ain't life a bitch?"
Ah shit, the Landlord just raised the rent, fuck that!
Dem old days that came and went like this
There's more ways you can use your time instead of
Looking for shit that you used to find
By the age of 16 ya finally come to grips
Livin life like this and nothin else mean shit
Looking for a smooth getaway 
Cool, cuz soon I'll see a better day
And if not - then I gots to deal with it
I ain't makin this, up hell naw it's real nigga

[Chorus]

No more suprises hopin I can open your eyes
And so I'm trying, instead of lookin up in the sky
I'm in the fast lane speed dreaming 
Nappin on cruise control please believe it!
In my city when you see it at night, look different than it does in the day
Ain't no tellin what'd happen if it wasn't this way
I ain't trippin off of shit it's a good thing
I made a name off the local neighborhood gang
And at that time I started rhyming 
And, set up a hill without help to start climbing
And I've been around this for a minute
You gotta get your own mix and get wit it
I made myself, learn to pay myself 
Nigga the game don't wait so I'ma stay myself
And now you can go and tell another nigga
On how the real ones is livin in the ghetto

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
