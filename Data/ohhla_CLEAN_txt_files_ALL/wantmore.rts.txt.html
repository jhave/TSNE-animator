Black Thought:
Well I'm a fly Philly nigga, finger on the trigga
MCs repent from sins, God's comin again
Original (what?),  visionary individual
Original (what?),  visionary individual
I proceed, as I give ya whatcha need
Like I'm a medical doctor, watch the damage 
I inflict properly, ain't nobody risin on top of me
I be droppin more plot in my mic monopoly
Got to be, got to be reality, Stevie Wonder see
Black Thought be me, I groove ba-by
Or I clue they say baby
Would you get with this? Not even maybe
It's the mister gravy and shit
To explain what's goin on inside my brain
You're scared, jealous
No analyst can maintain or handle this...
Mind train, yo
I'm on some old snap a rapper neck shit
You know what I'm sayin?
So niggaz best get out of my path
Kid, I'm on point like a gat
The basket case, I waste MCs with rapture taste
Facing these leads to cats diminished
They be pullin the mic out that ass when I get finished
Administrative assistant I'm not, yo, I'm the principal
Nigga, takin shots, like I'm invincible 
Figure me to be hardcore, my input cuts your jaw
For real, for short, do you want more?!!!??!
