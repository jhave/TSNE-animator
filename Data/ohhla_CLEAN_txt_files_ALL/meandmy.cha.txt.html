[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
Hold up, mayne
Watch me come down and do my thang
Watch me swang while I'm out ride change
Colors it ain't a gang
We twistin' and grippin' grain
In love with my money mayne
And my name is Chamillionaire and I'm ridin' swangs
From Shreveport to Little Rock and Talabanks
Grindin' is in my range
And that will never change
In love with my mayne

-Yeah
I show her off and let the groupies know that she's in my life
When I'ma billionaire I make a permanent be my wife
It's a period every month, when I don't give to touch her
But after 4 or 5 days it's over fiendin' to clutch her
Schemin' to bust her
Nut please don't be a nut
Cuz only a nut, will try to put his hands on my sluts
See boys know I'm wit' her but still try to holla at her
Alot of guys had her, but them other guys don't matter
Them guys with chatter, to tell the truth I would rather
Let them dream but at the end of the day I would have her
Her size is phatter but truthfully I like her thick
I'm in the club holdin' her takin' pictures with my chick
Forget a groupie, she's there after every show
We makin' love after the club, she tell's me I'm so
good at gettin' her to cum, and she comes often
She comes when I'm grindin', she comes when I flossin'
You haven't figured it out yet.
my money is my honey, my honey's my money
In God We Trust, tatted on her tummy
You can never take her from me
I'll never decieve her
Her last name is Franklin, her cousin is Visa
Believe the relationship I speak on is real
I'm in love with my money, my girlfriend is the dollar bill
Hold Up..Hold Up..Hold Up..It's Koopa

[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
Hold up, mayne
Watch me come down and do my thang
Watch me swang while I'm out ride change
Colors it ain't a gang
We twistin' and grippin' grain
In love with my money mayne
And my name is Chamillionaire and I'm ridin' swangs
From Shreveport to Little Rock and Talabanks
Grindin' is in my range
And that will never change
In love with my mayne</pre>
