[L]
Make like Moses and part my pussy like the Red Sea
And slide your fat tongue inside of me
Eat this motherfucker like it's a raw dish
[Man]
So what you want me to eat?
[L &amp; TM]
My pussy and shit
[L]
Before my pussy like a fresh ripe mango
And drink it on down like a wino drinks tango
You mumble "tell me when you're about to cum"
But don't stop, motherfucker, 'cause I ain't done
So get the whipped cream and the blueberries
No need for a cherry, 'cause I bust one already
You said you never felt it when I came
'Cause you was swallowing my discharge like a goddam drain
Slurping and  licking, licking and slurping
You ain't getting no pussy, so you better start jerking
'Cause this lesson here might take all night
So on your knees, motherfucker, and eat my pussy right
I take your legs, wrap it 'round your head
Suffocating this bitch 'till he's almost dead
I don't give a fuck, cause I'm trying to get off
Homeboy, himself, wasn't taking a loss
When I looked down, he had his hand on his dick
I could not believe he was masterbating and shit
What a day
[L &amp; TM]
What a day
[L]
Top rate
[L &amp; TM]
Top rate
[L]
Like Frosted Flakes
[L &amp; TM]
Like Frosted Flakes
It tastes great!
[L]
My pussy was gooping like cottage cheese
His mouth was dripping as he stood to his feet
Now the motherfucker wanna bust a nut
What do you tell him?
[L &amp; TM]
He out of luck!
[L]
I got my shit off, and now I'm done
So get your funky ass out 'fore I get my gun
He started dissing 'cause he had to leave
He said, "fuck you bitch, and your hair weave!"
So before he starts out in the middle of the night
Make sure you taught that motherfucker how to eat your pussy right</pre>
