Chorus

Niggaz live wit it, money drugs and murdah for life
Bitches deal with it, only lovin them hoes for the night
If your feeling it, get high its alright
but you can't get it, until the day of our demise

(repeat)

(Memphis Bleek)

You can holler at the dog haters wanna see me fall
Bitches wanna too see me ball killers they don't wanna see me at all
If I wasn't rolling with the rock
Will you niggaz pass rock share birds or flash glocks
I walk around wit two Mac's, razors and icepicks
Just cause you niggaz want to see me hurtin like them
Its all about the benjamins money cash hoe's 
livin through this shit i'm in nigger stack doe
Street scholar, eight figure nigga white collar cat 
ain't the M-E-M-P-H man, bitch holla back 
I'm a creature smoking on hay since it was reefer
Drug ass flow like I was cut wit ether
Mark ass nigger don't want a part of this nigga spark with this nigga

Ain't the type to buy you, mommy how you, slide cock inside you

Chorus (2x)

(Ja Rule)

Witness what it is to be real niggaz
