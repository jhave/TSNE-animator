[Baby]
Yeah

Ya know what I'm sayin
If you from where I'm from
Ya know what I'm talkin bout

and I feel couldnt nobody do it the way ima do it

so, here we go world, I'm bringin it to your world from my world
ya know what I'm talkin bout look I say

[Chorus: Baby]
Get your shine on {*3X*}
So nigga stop hatin'
Get your shine on {*3X*}
You know we gonna make it
Get your shine on {*3X*}
So nigga stop hatin'
Get your shine on {*3X*}
You know we gonna make it

[Baby]
In one you trust, the neighborhood is us
And everything that I ride is 22s and up
And everytime that I slide, you know I'm platinum plus
Make the hood understand that we trying to come up
24s on trucks, just the neighborhood lust
Tell Lil' One be cool everybody coming up
Cause everybody wanna ride, everybody wanna shine
So how ya love that people? Everybody on the grind
And these projects cuts ya, ya hood rich livin lavish
Those 14s, you know we had to have it
Once upon a time it was nothing but magic
Hustling right in front of my mama, Ms. Gladys
Chasin paper paper chasin, look thats all we know
Comin through the neighborhood on them 24s
Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand, nigga up it some more
Fast money, Cash Money, thats all I know One

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
They say I walk around like I got an S on my chest
That be that Cash Money Piece, flow rest in the deck
I'ma specially set, No testin the best
Be in class, no pencil, no test on the desk
I'll make ya mouthpiece so beast like Delereese
I'm from the south streets of beast like Lil' Weez
E, F baby for the team I rep daily
I come to the defense like Jeff Bailey, I'm gone wit it
A chrome kitted, A foam pit in the back of it
Phony tittie bitches come home with me, get the business
I made bling bling, I'm like a lighthouse
So shut that ice in cause he ain't iced out
Pay attention closely, You niggaz can never roast me
Cause the maker of the testerosta knows me
Oh hes so arrogant, the cocky kind
But you always looking cause I'ma shine, thats right

[Chorus]

[Baby]
Loud mics and big rims, nigga thats my life
Come through the neighborhood with my homeboy price
Lets get it understood, nigga thats my price
Come through the neck of the woods, you be alright
Cause I'm pimpin, I'm pimpin pimpin, I'm comin thru
And I'm dippin, I'm dippin dippin, them 22s
And they spinnin, they spinnin spinnin, them sprewells nigga
them sprewells nigga, we makin mail nigga
Don't need no introduction in this
I can grind in every ghetto, trying to stay hood rich
You can ask a nigga bout me, you know I'm bout my shit
I was made by guerillas, raised the hot boy click
Cause I'm the birdman and I'll do you something bad
You heard man that I been slangin them slacks
Thats my word man, I won't stunt nigga
I won't stunt nigga, I'm gonna stunt nigga, One

[Chorus]</pre>
