[Chorus]
Dump! Dump! My bedroom is such a
Dump! Dump! I like livin' in a
Dump! Dump! I can't help it it's a
Dump! Dump! Uh-huh, uh-huh

Don't try to compare this to another mess it's the best
Of the trash, lots of class, livin' in junk and don't take nothin' less
Because I start, chart, rip and tear it apart
'Cause I have taken the act made it into an art
Don't try to come inside, 'cause you just might die
Some old underwear everywhere you know why
'Cause everything is piled up where the odor lurks
Take one sniff and it's (choking to death)
I beat the nation with pollution and my radiation
Most people think that it's Hell, but this is my vacation
People pass out in my room 'ause they can't breathe
Most peple can't find the doorway so they never leave

[Chorus]

Uh-huh the room's pungent, (pungent)
I lock 'em up and use it as a dungeon (dungeon)
the D. E. V. O. S. P. I. C. E. Yeah you know me
I got you gaspin' and passin' out and squirming all around, G
In the mess so many kids got lost
I think they got burried underneith my dirty socks
In the back you find things that you can read about in Gorezone
And like L.A. it has been turned into a war zone
In my room there's a floor I ain't never seen
Don't feel sick, but I think my skin is turnin' green
When I'm bored I count the dead bugs on the ceiling
I'm tellin' you, man, nothing beats this feeling

[Chorus]

Now, my room is filled with this and that
No one knows for sure what happened to my cat
And for all y'all suckers who still don't understand
Check it out..
Some of them tried to clean it but they died whenever they tried
Some of them tried to clean it but they died
Some of them tried to clean it but they died whenever they tried
Some of them tried to clean it but they died
'Cause I love makin' a makin' a makin' a makin' a mess, baby
I love makin' a makin' a makin' a makin' a mess
I love makin' a makin' a makin' a makin' a mess, baby
I love makin' a makin' a makin' a makin' a mess
I'll make you're room a..

[Chorus]
