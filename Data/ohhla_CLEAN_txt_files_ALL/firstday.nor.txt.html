Hook (2x):
I juss came home 
I aint got no loot
I aint trin' 2 sell drugs
I aint tryin 2 shoot
I'm tryin' 2 be a good nigga even wearin a suit
But the only job I got is 2 make hot soup

Verse 1:
Open day
Now you release
Peeps
Bacc on the streets
You don't want no peace
Need a job or sumthin'
B-4 you start robbin sumthin'
Tryin 2-b made 
Like you in the mob or sumthin'

Activities swift
You can't 
Hit the streets cuz dese niggas a snitch
See yo foul nigga 
And he on yo ass

You thought he a homo
So baliff analyze

And juss pissed out your St. Ines
Reinact it always gotta take attractive

On the regular 
So what I aint got a haircut
