[Cee-Lo]
Huh, yeah.. hah hahhh ahh, oohh ahh
Get it, freak it down, oohh - ho yeah!
Ehhhh eh-ahhhhhhhh, hey nowwww

Hey now what it is party people
Shuga Baby got a brand new dance
It's just a little excuse to get loose
instead of sufferin from circumstance
But first let's do this party right
A little Hennessy and Sprite, baby how that sound
Now gather round, get ready cause it's heavy
Hush your mouth while I break it down
See what you do is find a freaky little thang
Talk to her, take her out on the flo'
Then you grind 'til your body catch fire
Talk nasty or nice and slow
You say, "Come here" and talk softly in her ear
Say it's almost time to go
And in the mornin when you're about to leave
you say, "I hope you enjoyed the show"

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
They call it the - sexual chocolate
Eh, good God y'all - sexual chocolate
Ho, take it easy now - sexual chocolate
Hey, eh-eyyyy now now - sexual chocolate
Oooh, and they call it the - sexual chocolate
Ho, good God y'all - sexual chocolate
Huh, take it easy now - sexual chocolate
Ahhhh-hah hah-ahhhh-ahhhh - sexual chocolate

Hey hey (I feel like freakin tonight)
(I feel like freakin tonight)
Whatchu wanna do (I feel like freakin tonight)
(I feel like freakin tonight)
(I feel like freakin tonight)
(I feel like freakin tonight)
Ooooh-oooh (I feel like freakin tonight)
(I feel like freakin tonight)

[Cee-Lo]
See I'm talkin bout enhancin the dancin, romancin
  You really want your freedom can't be scared of takin chances
It's kind of funny how the bumpin and the grinding's remindin
  How everytime you dance it's yourself that you're findin
And then the music got me movin and it's groovin and it's soothin
  You got to grab somebody's hand they'll tell you they know where to use it
Ohh, sweet-talkin and touchin and kissin and rollin
  What's life without lovin?

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
They call it the - sexual chocolate
Eh, good God y'all - sexual chocolate
Mmm, take it easy now - sexual chocolate
Eh-eyyyy - sexual chocolate
Oooh, they call it the - sexual chocolate
Mmmmmm, good God y'all - sexual chocolate
Mm, take it easy now - sexual chocolate
Heyyy hey hey hey heyyyyy - sexual chocolate

Heyy heyy heyy (I feel like freakin tonight)
(I feel like freakin tonight)
Oh (I feel like freakin tonight)
(I feel like freakin tonight)
Mmm (I feel like freakin tonight)
(I feel like freakin tonight)
Whatchu wanna do (I feel like freakin tonight)
(I feel like freakin tonight)
