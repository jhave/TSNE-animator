Roll that weed bitch
Roll that roll that weed bitch (bitch)

[Verse: Chip Tha Ripper]
(Roll it, bitch, Roll it)
Just copped me a o.z
With your bitch and she all nosey
She askin' to many questions
I told her we bout to blow trees
Than after that she gone blow me
Than I'm just gone smoke some mo' tree
Leave the dressing room smokey
Wear all black cause I'm low-key
Keep the.40 cal. on me
No nigga I'm not ya homie
These rappers is some jabronis
Some actors, a bunch of phonies
Slap the shit out you homie
Act like you got some sense
You nigga's try to play tough on them songs but I'm not convinced
My Cleveland niggas some killas
No fighting we want ya soul
No fussin', cussin', no talkin'
Just pop and you hit the do'
Than break that bitch of the hendges
And than you hit the flo'
You nigga's ain't on my level
You never got to my flow
Yo elevator don't make it
This how it be cause you's a ho
That lemon g in my 'rillo
The coldest and you should know, and
Baby girl say she want to hang with the crew
I say "Bring a zip bitch and make sure you wanna screw"

[Chorus: Chip Tha Ripper]
Roll that weed bitch
Roll that roll that weed bitch (bitch)
Roll that weed bitch
Roll that roll that weed bitch (bitch)
Roll that weed bitch
Roll my fucking weed bitch
Roll that weed bitch
Roll that roll that weed biaatch!

Roll that weed bitch
Roll that roll that weed bitch
Roll that weed bitch
Roll that fucking weed bitch
Roll that weed bitch
Roll that roll that weed bitch</pre>
