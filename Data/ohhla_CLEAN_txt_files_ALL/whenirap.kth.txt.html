Verse 1

When I rap competition perform disappearing acts
I jam suckers like smuckers
My squad is funky like a six pack of motherfuckers
With conversation my creations will collider nations into confrontation
Competition couldn't stand a chance
I'll wear you out like if I had one pair of pants
Murray emphasises cadarac poetry meaning you blind bats can't see me
Throughout my career I rip year to year sucessfully
Dragging debree in my vicinity
My symbol is the sickle like the Grim Reaper
My style is the greatest invention since the speaker
A pyschopath with a knife in my voice 
The lyrical homocidal madman is top choice
The scene I scope it first because I'm homophobic
And then I rope-a-dope it
And dominate the sight of  bloody red
Coming out my head leaving rappers brain dead
I come through like POW! and BAM!
Reppin' like the lyrical version of Shazaam (Damn!....)
When I rap

Chorus(2x)

[L.L. Cool J sample] Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
[DMX sample] Believe what I say!
[Keith Murray] When I rap

Verse 2

When I rap one hand can't clap
So lets squash the beef cook it and we all can get fat
Try to swallow a line and you'll find
I'm one hard act to follow rollow in my vibe
Swallow and your throat will explode
Sending you through schizophrenic episodes
My style is so well off on it's own 
I leave it unattended and go see my dog about a bone
When I'm the microphone ( When I rap )
And biting niggas will leave it alone
I go together with the rythm like a sentence and some verbs
And herbs so check out every word
I kicked a verse for Father Time
He put the world on pause cause I fucked his head up with a rhyme
Diamond studded rough and rugged fuck it
There's nothing left for you to do now but kick the bucket
Dummy who's ever flipping
It better be a round-off back hand-spring arabian summy
With more concentration then an acrobat
When I rap

Chorus

Verse 3

When I kick the gift of gab and I'm grim and I'll be god damned
If any mortal or immortal man can withstand
And not slam my jams cause I take them on a trip
And flip the script with legit manuscripts
Fogging up the mic with real legit compounds
Mass mic Murray man flurries in the bound
Oh what the fuck you fall and can't get up when I erupt
So pass the buck cause you've been struck
With the will I learn will I burn
Off carbon dioxide cause I'm on the flip side
Word conducter emcee destructer
Millions be saying "That Murray's a motherfucker!"
I dip and dive punch you in your eye
In a battle if you try to lie in your rhymes when we socialize
I'm beating Mother Nature down to her knees
While making more papers than trees
You can't be serious that's impossible
I leave niggas laid up in the hospital
Bandaged from head to toe and hat
My shit is intact when I rap

Chorus(4x)</pre>
