[Pharrell]
Hate when they call me superstar
Do I look like a superstar?
Yet unreachable and very far
Ever noticed I'm right here wit' ya'll?
I cover my face because they do not need to see
I ain't no gangsta or no thug, I am just being me
The world smells of drama
So I cover up my nose
The faces like film leavin' out too long, gets overexposed
Getting praised by magazines
From the girlfriends in my clothes
I hope they still love me when I shun away cause I am afraid to blow

[Chorus: Pharell]
WANT WAR?!!
Well! WAR WE'LL GIVE!
We'll be rocking this BANDANNA!
Well! You/So You
CAN'T SEE SHIT!

[Pharrell]
Now the fear of blowing up
Definitely takes it's toll
It sends it's demons down to your mind to take control
If it thinks it's got my mind
It better think again
I got the pleasure of the piano and this powerful pen
But you (You!)
You want fifteen minutes to shine, what's your concept? 
What's so interesting? What's your desire?
Soon as you get your cover story
And your precious headlines
So sorry, so sorry, so sorry
They'll just fuck you from behind

[Chorus: Pharell]
WANT WAR?!!
Well! WAR WE'LL GIVE!
We'll be rocking this BANDANNA!
Well! You/So You
CAN'T SEE SHIT!

[Pharrell]
I don't wanna blow up
I'm smiling cause I know
All the pieces that make me me will glisten from my soul
My self-esteem is not a fake
It comes from within
Come and take a picture,
I'll sign whatever you want my friend
Still.. (Still..) Still..(Still..)
Yeah!
...War

[Chorus: Pharell]
WANT WAR?!?
Well! WAR WE'LL GIVE!
We'll be rocking this BANDANA!
Well! You/So You
CAN'T SEE SHIT!

...WANT WAR!??!</pre>
