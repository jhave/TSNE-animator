Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Cock back, lock and load
I got my aim, I'm ready to go
I hit the target
Right where her heart is
I'm a killer, love killer, love killer

The way she move like Shakira
Clock's ticking, there's no time to give up
Had one, two shots of tequila
Thanks for a good time I feel ya
The way she move like Shakira
In and out of love I'm a killer
Killer, killer, killer, killer, killer

Now tell me do you like it, you like it
Tell me how you want it, you want it
Tell me do you like it, you like it
Tell me how you want it, you want it

Tell me do you like it, you like it
Tell me how you want it, you want it
Tell me do you like it, you like it
Tell me how you want it, you want it
Killer, killer, killer, killer
Killer, killer, killer, killer

In another magazines, load up
What you saying to me Hun? Hold up
Ya keep saying there's no man above me
Do I love her, but she love me
Silence, I never start lying
You fuck the night in the car till she start coming
Set a man who get gassed of a girl
But say the wrong thing then the wrong chicks start coming

The way she move like Shakira
Clock's ticking, there's no time to give up
Had one, two shots of tequila
Thanks for a good time I feel ya
The way she move like Shakira
In and out of love I'm a killer
Killer, killer, killer, killer, killer

Now tell me do you like it, you like it
Tell me how you want it, you want it
Tell me do you like it, you like it
Tell me how you want it, you want it

Cause I'm something like a killer, killer, killer
Go set me free
I'm something like a killer, killer, killer
Go let me free
Killer, killer, killer, killer
Killer, killer, killer, ki...

Killer, killer

Tell me do you like it, you like it
Tell me how you want it, you want it
Tell me do you like it, you like it
Tell me how you want it, you want it

Cause I'm something like a killer, killer, killer
Go set me free
I'm something like a killer, killer, killer
Go let me free

Now tell me do you like it, you like it
Tell me how you want it, you want it
Tell me do you like it, you like it
Tell me how you want it, you want it

Killer, killer, killer, killer
Killer, killer, killer, killer</pre>
