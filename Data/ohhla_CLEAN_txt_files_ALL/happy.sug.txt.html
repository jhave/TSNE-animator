(Put your panties back on baby)

Hey...
...Suga Free the pimp how do you do?
...Good Evening

She will never ask me, Baby who's that bitch?
She will never ask me, Who you going with?
She will never ask me, When will you be back?
She will never ask me, How did you get that lack?
She will never ask me, Where that money come from?
She will never ask me, Why did you run?
She will never ask me, why you got the pen
Cuz I'll slap her in the mouth and say shut up bitch

I seen you walking down the street, could you be for me
Girl your so petite, I just want to see
Your the apple of my eye, make my nature rise
Don't wanna waste your cunt, tell me could you be
Could you be with me tonight, I promise little lady that I'll do it right
I already know whats a man to see, after warming up you can smoke with me
Could you be with me tonight, I promise little lady that I'll do it right
You gotta let me know baby I'm a G, if you got a nigga he aint fuckin with me
Don't you know, That you, Do really make me Happy, Happy
Don't you know, That you, Do really make me Happy, So Happy
When I'm rollin on my sprees, bumpin Suga Free
candy paint so clean, check my gangsta lean
Poppin Bottles every night, before I rip the mic
Would you come with me tonight, Tell me could you be
Could you be with me tonight, I promise little lady that I'll do it right
I already know whats a man to see, after warming up you can smoke with me
Could you be with me tonight, I promise little lady that I'll do it right
You gotta let me know baby I'm a G, if you got a nigga he aint fuckin with me
Don't you know, That you, Do really make me Happy, Happy
Don't you know, That you, Do really make me Happy, So Happy

I, Step, My, Game, Up, so if you disrespect me get outta pocket and you can get fucked up
Cuz I, Cant, Wait, For, You, Cuz I'm a pimp baby and I gotta do what I gotta do
Don't you know, That you, Do really make me Happy, (Really, really though) Happy
Don't you know, That you, Do really make me Happy, So Happy
Don't you know, That you, Do really make me Happy, Happy (So Happy)
Don't you know, That you, Do really make me Happy, So Happy (You Make me so happy)

Don't you know, Do you really make me happy, happy
Don't you know, That you, Do really make me Happy, So Happy
Don't you know, That you, Do really make me Happy, Happy
Don't you know, That you, Do really make me Happy, So Happy (Girl Leave me alone)</pre>
