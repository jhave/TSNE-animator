[redneck]
( *coughing* ) That sweet's killer, man
I'm high 'like an eagle', and like the Steve Miller Band
I'm a smoker, a midnight toker
Get the Adidas box top under the sofa with the joker
Then let's roll a big old fat
Square like this here, smell like a ( ? )
[Devin]
Man, I bet yo weed ain't better than mine
[redneck]
Oh, that's bullshit
[Devin]
Take heed of my weed, man, all you need is a little bit

Reefer and beer
Can you say that?
[redneck]
Reefer and beer
[Devin]
Put some soul in it, make it like...
Reefer and beer
[redneck]
Reefer and beer

[Devin]
High, yes I am
Smokin this weed again
I had one sweet left, I broke it down and rolled two
And sold them hoes and scored a three for ten
I spend my cash and time on grass and wine
You ask for my opinion, I say it don't make
A lot of hoes hope you choke and stay broke
Or smoke coke but nope, I bend but won't break
I made major mistakes but hey, they're all mine
You gotta learn how to get up when you fall down
Lived in a small town throwin rocks at cows in a field of dreams
Hopin it will amount to just more than a hell of beans
I feel the need for beer and weed
[redneck]
Why don't you smoke some here with me?
And we can ride through the ghettos and trailer parks
We can drink and spark until it gets dark
[Devin]
I wake up in the mornin and I roll me a square
Sweet or whatever, I put that hoe in the air
( *inhales* ) Hit that muthafucka couple of times
Sit back and recline and try to relax my mind
With some

[Devin]
Reefer and beer
Reefer and beer
Reefer and beer
Reefer and beer

[Devin]
It's a brand new you, I guess it's time to start anew
Time to get our shit together, think about things we gotta do
Stay close to all our family, keep in touch with all our friends
Last year was kinda shaky, it's time for makin some ends
Take care of our kids and then
Go and get some

[Devin]
Reefer and beer
Reefer and beer
Reefer and beer
