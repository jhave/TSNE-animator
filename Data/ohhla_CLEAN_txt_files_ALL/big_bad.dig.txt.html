Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I won't look back
I'll take my chance in the world
Out in the big bad world
I'll fall but I'll never burn
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Are you alone in the big bad world?
Alone in the big bad world

Made a vow to the game
That I'll never get caught up
In this thing called fame is what shows us
Just to hold out, to get tow up
And forget about the way you was brought up
From the floor up, put you together to get in like coke
Cause then you get spit out the mouth like reflux
And you want reduct
Man, this game is thicker than Niptuck
But you can't let it kill ya
Why don't you look at the side that's realer
Not the fast life, not the parties
The reason why ya here, your career
Little thing that made you V.I.P
The reason why they never need to see ID
The reason why the bottles on the house every week
Save me a friend but when a day's bleak
Not sittin' right by ya side
They just got one thing in mind
Never yo best interest
Just best send you up out every night
What's this, talking to life
Cause this one's got you close
To the edge it's li-like a drug
You better learn not to overdose
Speedin' in the fast life, pullin' out the champagne
Livin' every night like you don't give a damn thing
Look at you now and how things did change
Lying within you is pain
Never got hell something you wanted
Could make you feel so ashamed
In this world you just gotta say

I won't look back
I'll take my chance in the world
Out in the big bad world
I'll fall but I'll never burn
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Are you alone in the big bad world?
Alone in the big bad world

Yeah, yeah, we all livin' in a big bad world
Boy meets girl, everything is greasy
Used to pick her up, beep beep
Put her in the backseat
Stop in the lot, then skeet skeet
He was a thug, she was a love
That's how she thought it should be, be
He was sellin' em drugs, bustin' em slugs
She's runnin' all around in the street, street
Let's fast forward, nine months over here
Come a baby around in a stroller
"That's not mine" is what he told her
Now her world just got much colder
He said it was through
Then what she gon' do?
Mom skeets around in a baby too
She gotta hustle for money
To put food in the tummy
Shake her booty for dummies
In that room that they come in
But there ain't no one by her side
To let her know it's all right
She don't have much, but she tries
To stop her baby from cryin'
She's a lady of deny
You can lay with per bribes
She would've made a beautiful wife
But now she can't because she's
Growing in the fast line
You's pouring champagne
Gvinin' up her body like she don't give a damn thing
Look at you now and how things did changed
Lying would do you some change
She forgot that she is a woman
How she's degraded is a shame
In this world you just gotta say

I won't look back
I'll take my chance in the world
Out in the big bad world
I'll fall but I'll never burn
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Are you alone in the big bad world?
Alone in the big bad world

They say you should have whatever you like
But does that mean that you get what you need?
Maybe the world could be yours in time
But does happiness grow on trees?
Does happiness grow on trees?
Does happiness grow on..

I won't look back
I'll take my chance in the world
Out in the big bad world
I'll fall but I'll never burn
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Alone in the big bad world
Are you alone in the big bad world?
Alone in the big bad world</pre>
