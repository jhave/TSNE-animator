On fire now!
I love to stand up in corners
With thugs, holdin' it down
Or be in golf courses
Sippin' on somethin' poly and contract
Love to floss heavy with shine for that ass
I love to hit and drop bombs right on top of that ass
Wassup
I like to watch my whole crew break bread
We thug marraige, select chicks
Give me this head
??, stack for my crew
Not whips, it's just some of the wild shit
That I be lovin' to do
Wassup

[Keith]
Girl it's gettin' 'round
Heard you wanna get down
Find out for yourself
How I really put it down
And maybe since you're curious
Take a ride and find out what
I do to make you fall
Deep in love
It's the things I do

1 - [Keith]
    The things I do, the
    Diamonds I wear, the
    Bentley, I drive
    And the things I do
    When we're makin' love

Repeat 1

[Keith]
One night
Is all I need to make you see
Two nights
Why don't you come home with me
And I'll give you everything your body needs
Mya, Mya, Mya, Mya
I want you to see

2 - [Mya]
    Lemme get my handcuffs
    Baby put your hands up
    Lemme get my blindfold
    Gotta keep your eyes closed
    We got all night
    Comin' three or four times
    So many things I wanna do

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Rah Digga]
Yeah, I like to keep heads guessin'
Give 'em a test and
Blow they whole mind if I find 'em interestin'
Best in the business
Lyrics came as a blessin'
Why you be on the block
Tryna guess who I'm sexin'
Cool type of mami like Thug Castradami
Take a few years to get near the punani
Now, see me with a apple or vanilla Martini
While I get the biggest kicks
Outta chicks tryna be me

[Keith]
(So many things) so many things, so many things
(So many things) so many things, oh yes we are
(So many things) so many things, so many things
(So many things) so many things, so many things

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Repeat 2

Repeat 1 to fade</pre>
