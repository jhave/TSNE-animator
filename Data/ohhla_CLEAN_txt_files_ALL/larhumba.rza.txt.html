[Intro: Ndira]
Here we are..
Bobby, I was just wondering, you know
About me and you, tonight
If we could go to a little Rhumba
Dance, you just think about it and let me know

[Chorus: Ndira]
Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Ven baila conmigo en esta Rhumba
Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Ven baila conmigo esta Rhumba

[RZA]
Rhumba? What's Rhumba?
I'm sayin' though, what?
I'm sayin'..

Yo, what up Butter Pec'? Girl, you got me shy to speak
You the same dime piece that I saw last week
On the dancefloor, yo, the way you bligh
Make a club of thugs do the Electric Slide
Pretty in pink, come here, let me buy you a drink
Armaretta sour orders put us both in sync'
My name is Bobby and I don't usually dance that much
I play the wall, but girl, you got that magic touch
That lured me in like a fly into the spider's web
Not these everyday hoes sweatin' ghetto celebs
Powerule, I heard you got the good Power-U
Let's slip to my crib for an hour or two

[Chorus 2X]

[Method Man]
Hey, hey, hey..
Uh, uh, uh, uh..
Eh eh eh eh eh..

Hey Butter Pecan what's that lingo you speakin'?
It sound like, let's me and you slide for the weekend (True)
I got drinks and tasty treats to sink your teeth in
Your popi two-way beefin', let him know that you cheatin'
Runnin' 'round indecent exposed without no clothes
There it go (*plug*), Moby Dick and there she blows
You got me covered, girl, and it shows and I suppose
We can play doctor soon as I drop out ya bows

[Killa Sin]
I don't wanna dance baby girl, it's like my legs is on strike
Boogie that ass to the bar, snatch a Remi, no ice
I'm in the corner, we can vibe all night
Polite, I need a bag of that grass
To blast me out of sight like a satellite
Bigga what up? Yo, long time, good to see you
Look at shorty ass shakin' like the system in my vehicle
Clubbin', twenty deep, buggin', all types of funny freaks
Mouthes wide shut, we let our love for the money speak

[Chorus]

[Beretta 9]
Yo 
Open season, open fire, Beretta barbed wire
First platoon strike soon, scud-missile on the whistle
Up in the club with the pistol
This chick bumped into me like, "You Dig', you ain't official"
Indeed, so? Blow out your back, yo
She was like, "Yo, nigro, nigro"
Puffin' all that trash, you best to see so (so so)
So I introduced her nightcap, she was like, "I like that"
Later on tonight, you know, I gotta spit that
Flow and a half, blow at her back
I like it rough, and I hope she's rough back
She was like say her name
I was like, "Say mine back"
She was like, "Yo, daddy, daddy, daddy"
I love it like that, Beretta stay givin' it
Power-U so good, I just might have to jizz in it

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
