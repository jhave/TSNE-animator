Uh 
What (Hang on) wherever you at 
Hold your head 
Put your head to the sky 
For my ankle bracelet niggas (Hang on) 
25 to life niggas 
Outlawz hang on (Hang on) 
Hang on 
All my thugs hang on (Hang on) 
Hang on (Hang on) 
Yeah 

Verse 1: Young Noble 

For all my thug niggas I got on the block (Hang on) 
For all the little homies running from the cops (Hang on) 
If you a fiend around the way coked out (Hang on) 
If you a ex-drug dealer smoked out (Hang on) 
If you a soldier locked down in the hole (Hang on) 
No heat in your house and its cold (Hang on) 
No job just got laid off (Hang on) 
You did your verse but we taking you off (Hang on) 
You had your ears all ready for the Lawz (Hang on) 
And if you think about sniffing that rock (Hang on) 
You about to hop in your homies stolen car (Hang on) 
You got a dream to be a big rap star (Hang on) 
You gotta hustle but you keep getting robbed (Hang on) 
And now you paying for protection from the mob (Hang on) 
Your baby mama want half of your check (Hang on) 
And your little homies give you no respect (Hang on) 
And now you waiting for your time to come around (Hang on) 
Be offered work and you turning it down (Hang on) 
And now your homies looking at you all funny (Hang on) 
You been clocking for 12 years and no money (Hang on) 

Chorus: Young Noble 

Hang on 
If you're out in the cold with nowhere to go you gotta (Hang on) 
You 15 and you feel real old youngster (Hang on) 
You only 21 and you ain't even coming home soldier (Hang on) 
Four kids and make enough to feed one homie (Hang on) 

Verse 2: Young Noble 

Hang on 
If you a thug (Hang on) 
You on drugs (Hang on) 
You took slugs (Hang on) 
You shed blood (Hang on) 
You got it bad (Hang on) 
You niggas mad (Hang on) 
You unprotected 
Hand on 
And now she pregnant (Hang on) 
You pop shit and you don't even got a glock (Hang on) 
You from the streets and you don't even got a block (Hang on) 
You got the nerve to try to criticize me (Hang on) 
Trying to judge the Young N-O-B-L-E (Hang on) 
My homie Swift locked down right now (Hang on) 
You got dough for some pounds right now (Hang on) 
Too many niggas on your block for you to eat (Hang on) 
Them out of town niggas steady trying to creep (Hang on) 

Chorus 

Verse 3: Ya Yo 

If you single 'cause your man ain't shit (Hang on) 
Independent ain't pressed for the dick (Hang on) 
Kool-Aid money with Cristal taste (Hang on) 
You ain't think that I will punch you in your face (Hang on) 
All my ladies in the struggle like me (Hang on) 
All my ladies trying to bubble like me (Hang on) 
You go to school or you strip for a living (Hang on) 
Only 20 and you got 3 children (Hang on) 

Verse 4: Mil 

If you got your test back and it's positive (Hang on) 
If your bitch left you 'cause she know you got it (Hang on) 
You friends disrespect you for not riding (Hang on) 
You did for 3 years and couldn't call nobody (Hang on) 
You caught another charge in jail added to the robbery (Hang on) 
You in the county can't get a visit from your family (Hang on) 
Your baby mother fucking one of your homies (Hang on) 
You in the ?? (Hang on) 
Don't nobody give a fuck about me 
Little Nob hold on 
I'm a young G 
I always stay strong 

Chorus 2: Young Noble 

You signed a bogus contract now wanna get out you better (Hang on) 
Your mama kicked your ass out 'cause you chose that route you better (Hang on) 
And if you wonder how long we gonna be on top you need to (Hang on) 
You niggas wish but you never gonna be like Pac they better (Hang on) 
They better hang on 
They better hang on </pre>
