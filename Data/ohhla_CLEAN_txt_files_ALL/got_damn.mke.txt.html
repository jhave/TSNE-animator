[Mike Jones]
Who came in the game
and ran the underground just by sayin' his name
Mike Jones-Jones, the dude that's so smooth
In 7 months he blew, split haters in 2
I started off movin' rocks, til' I got my name hot
Now my plot is to jump in rap and wreckshop
Some said I'ma flop, now they scared cuz I'm hot
I'm on top and they not so they wanna hate and knock
I'm in demand, thanks to all my fans
How he blew up so fast, some don't understand
I'ma man with plans, I hit the road for grands
Depend on self, never depend on man
Cuz man 'll leave you stuck, fucked with no bucks
Outta luck, want some cash you better hustle up
Cuz ain't shit comin' free cuz it ain't come free to me
So you gon' have to grind hard just like me
To get paid, either that or minimum wage
My advice I'm bout to give you take this here to ya grave
You don't work, you don't eat, you don't grind, you don't shine
No if and's or but's, bottom line-line
You don't work, you don't eat, you don't grind, you don't shine
No if and's or but's, bottom line</pre>
