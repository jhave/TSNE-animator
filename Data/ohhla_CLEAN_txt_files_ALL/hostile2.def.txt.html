Yo, yo, yo...
Ow! Motherfucker, sneakin in your backyard ??
Wit your daughter, naked, ha ha
What you know about it, what you know about it

[Redman]
Yo, why you buggin?
I stick a 16 shot slug in your ear
Put it to my dick so you hear me comin
I.C.U. critical, up on a stretcher
The 45 undresser, put on the pressure
You need a bulletproof overall suit to protect your neck up
You dealin then shuffle the deck up
Fuck the IRS, I'm the NRS
Nigga Revenue Service, talico inserter
Murder, a six letter word to convert a
Beef you better off flippin beef at Fat Burger
Yo Keith, pull out the burner
(he won't move any further)
Yeah, tannin your body more than white boy surfers
I carry tools like Sears Surplus
So when I spit you catch heart murmurs
Word, you sweeter than cupcakes
I concentrate to blow blocks where your crew pump weight
Each generation, rules the nation
Rock more spots than a hundred one dalmations
I'm not a hog I'm a big dog wit big balls
Lock it down like pit jaws to Crenshaw
Then y'all be like
He's jiggy like fat bitches wit cellulite
Chicken might dine like cops
First of the month these thugs
Will leave your bones in harmony from the slug
I beat pussy down when I'm smokin the la
Bitches leave the room screamin "Oh na na Oh na na"

[Erick Onassis]
E dog the mic demolitioner
The black superhero Def Squad's the clique, we rock shit
Cuz we flossiest
No thug cats show us often this
We the boss in this
Why think of double crossin this
Your first joint so wack it made me confused, forget who I be
I'll catch you eye then, ya heard
I live the life that's quite chill
On the hill wit a glass of water and 20 mil
Believe you me, E
I got a fresh flow I keep it blazed like dat fo' sho'
Some cats are sheisty, so I pack toast
My name aint Next and, y'all Too Close
The rap emperor, scorchin hot
Be the temperature, let's see, think I'm funny
I make you laugh goodfella
I smack you down in front of your fans
Then watch the show, in the stands, nigga
Don't fuck around that's what I mean yo
Def Squad comin through again, El Nino

[Keith Murray]
And why should we listen to you, anyway
You's a sucker MC wit a sucker DJ
I hit you with the all in the hammer
Cocksucker, niggas in DC say bammer
Master thrasher, on a binge for revenge
Make a hardcore nigga cry when I kill all his friends
And force destruction wit my coalition
Bang a nigga in the chest for frontin when he should be listenin
I comes through too true
Like a half pit, half man, HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO!
Shut the fuck up, fuck you part two
I kill a rock and put a brick in the hospital</pre>
