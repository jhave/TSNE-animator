[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
Lights, camera, action (smooth)
The extra blazin' I push
Is like Moses talkin' to the burnin' bush
Face the furious meltdown of underground bugs
The kingpin racing all my thugs, hear
When I set the flossing overhead now
With the click that makes you die for the family and god
No doubt we're facing this and guard ya radius
When I come with the squad, that would dead it instantanious
Arms grab me, out to kill and fail to force fire
Just to put me in change behind Bob Wire
Keep a strap on his lap, son the gate is fat
Bless 'em, it's done
The dragon make it for blocks, til you open up the safe box
For new glocks my revolution is cold as every hour
My firepower is aimed at your control tower
True that, I thought you knew that
My swerve is out of hand
Introducing scatter black
My stiffness

[Verse 2: Kenny]
It's on, hands of the pocket wanna gun slinger
The street linger holdin' the dead bringer
Poppin' your dirty finger
Scatter, niggaz fear the mercenary corner vet
Deep like the projects, America's threat
Walkin' nightmares shots wolves packed
And cray burners and switch blades
Havin' brothers runnin' like slaves
The warning five, generate pies, niggaz will die
Trap the lost souls in the game that we specialize

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
We hittin' your set in a posse
A legendary man it's the plan
With main land, approachin' ghetto celeb status
Guns for hire movin' keys of my empire
The source is, niggaz beat you for their own forces
A Wolf In Sheep's Clothing and snakes that rattle
Plus your ultimate fear, is being cut down and babble
Blessin' with the team an' then get the creamin'
My bloodline is fiendin' to slay the demon
So what you want dunn? Tonz O' Gunz
Hoe's most goes in addition
Rollin' in the crew for position
Damn to my terror the cruel love etcetera
Warrior, competitor a step ahead of ya
Fruitcakes front like you're from the penintentiary
Cause outside ya "full" inside ya "empty"
Tempt me, to break your manhood and whip you like a mule
Cause the world has no pity for the fool
Meet the press, now don tell us really what it represents
Any man should die for turning state's evidence
Who you facin' the extra blazin', conversation
It's probably why they hold me in for tax evasion
Hold my click knock the bricks and my family-e
Preparin' all my enemies to fall before my feet
It's sweet to see the black man rise
Open your eyes C.L. Smooth specialize

[Verse 4: C.L. Smooth]
Take 'em to streets where fleets and fool runnin
Trapped of, in the Holy War where +you don't want it+
If the few would escalate and the drama can't seize
Take this cueball and the sock to the headpiece
The crime iller for realer the hunted bounty killer
Trackin' something sinis'(sinis) then confess to your minis'(minis)
I want seven figures, we pull the biggest triggers
Or bring the lynch mob back and start hangin' niggaz
With brute force I show no remorse
Break you off like sexual intercourse
Dig it, the connection
For you to start to pay me for protection
And make no mistake, we want all the cake
Do your pull-ups and dibs in the cool out
Muscle and buck with midnights strides
All my players start hustlin'
What you wait all the skill
and made you supplies
To buck these drugs we specialize
