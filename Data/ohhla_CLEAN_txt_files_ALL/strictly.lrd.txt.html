Song:   Strictly for the Ladies
Typed by: scott_rodkey@hotmail.com

This is stricly for the ladies, no ifs ands or maybes
We can chill together but hold on the babies
Let's have fun with this, I stand thunderous
Any girl I get I work wonders with
Most try to step to me and then get upset with me
Cause I read them up and down like mental telepathy
Now, I settle down but not necessarily
With a girl who wants me for a Cherokee
Or other things that I have in the background
When I cut 'em off they go (Oh it's like that now?)
Yeah whatever, get yourself together
Cause ain't nothing change with Finesse but the weather
Trying to go all out baby? You'd better sidestep
You're on some new stuff that I ain't even tried yet
You might think I'm insane or crazy
Yeah, I know, this is strictly for the ladies

Now I give a girl more than she's asking for
I take them 18 and up, and that's for sure
So when you're done or you're bored with your stupid zero
Contact me and I'll save you like a super hero
Please your needs and get all close to you
And do you right like a man is supposed to do
Knock your boots until I begin to sprout
Give you something to brag to your friends about
After a date I'm the type to get pissed
When y'all girls want to front on a kiss
I let 'em know I'm not slow or work late
Y'all front the role (I don't kiss on the first date)
Baby please, don't give me that feedback
Straight up and down, you expect me to believe that?
I'll take a kiss or a peck with a tight hug
I'm not the type to go out like a lightbulb
Or get crazy or go insane or get fed up
I'll get smooth and fuck your whole head up
Get you open so I could get in, you see
The next day I might lose my memory
(Finesse, remember last night's action?)
I don't know nothing and ain't nothing happened
(But last night you was kissing and hugging me!)
Sorry to disappoint you, but it wasn't me
Now she's embarassed, astounded, and hurting
The fly girl a whole different person
So see, how I dissed her and played her
Just to get the odds in my favor
You may think I'm out of hand or crazy
Yeah, that's why, this is strictly for the ladies

	"Now girls step up to this" - Cut and scratched 4x

Now I'm fast, quick, legit cause I'm slick
Look for a girl, which one will I pick?
Rhyming, writing, I'm exciting
I like the girls that are short and light-skinned
Or dark and lovely, short not chubby
Keep your distance if you are ugly
I'm esquisite, pay me a visit
Tell me your name, don't front on your digits
I'm calm, cooler, I'm the rap ruler
Don't mess with the girls that mess with the rulers
Keep intact, stay off the crack
Now if you have a fight then I got your back
Mean, strict, don't yell or riff
Don't play too hot to trot or hard to get
Don't drink beer but soda, I like Coca-Cola
I take my girls 18 and older
Not the ones that are younger, they be acting dumber
They're always fonting on their phone number
Now I'm 19, before I was 18
I'm not faking, I'm just stating
That I'm greater, I'm a creator
If you are ugly then I'll check you later
But if you are bigger, got a nice figure
Contact me if you don't have a nigga
I'll be waiting, conversating
Rhyming on the mic like this is frustrating
But I can rap longer because I'm stronger
I'm no kid that plays with Transformers
I'm not sloppy, I don't get snotty
Rhyming on the mic like this is my hobby
I don't get wacker, I get better
See a fly girl in the crowd, go get her
And I'll be rhyming and not flaking
And that girl will be mine for the taking
I'm no theif and I'm no meanace
But I'm gonna say something before I'm finished
Now y'all may not like the rhymes that I'm sporting
But practice safe sex cause that's important
These are the things that a real brother might say
Protect yourself and do things the right way
Like that y'all, bust a rap y'all
Now before you have sex wear a hat y'all
Here we go now, and that's the end of it
Yo, do these things so you can benefit
Now I'm getting loose with the skills God gave me
Dedicating stuff like this strictly to the ladies
