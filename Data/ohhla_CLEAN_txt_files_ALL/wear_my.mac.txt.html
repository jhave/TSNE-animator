Song:   Wear My Hat
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat
But now she think she got it like that
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat
Mmm I think she think she got it like that

Baby you could wear my hat
Just make sure you give it back
Baby you could wear my hat
If you got somethin' to match

Baby you could wear my hat, just twist it to the back
We drinkin' out the bottle while you sittin' on my lap
Then we could go outside, let me take you for a ride
With the top down show you off to people you my prize
Nothin' like a girl who likes to wear a pair of Nikes
Shinin' like my high beams cooler than some ice tea
Yeah I got a female, who like to send some pictures to my email
Professional with shop and you would think she worked at retail
Snapbacks make 'em look so cute, and that girl know how to blow
Somethin' like she played the flute
That long hair and it's fallin' down her back
I put on my hat and she reach and try to snatch it
Baby you be hotter than a match stick, bad bitch
Make a snapback look fantastic but sorry you can't have this
She smiled big, kissin' on my cheek
Baby you could wear my hat make sure you give it back to me

Baby you could wear my hat
Just make sure you give it back
Baby you could wear my hat
If you got somethin' to match

Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat
Just make sure you give it back, Just make sure you give it back
Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat
If you got somethin' to match, If you got somethin' to match that

She like to play her stupid games with me
She never seem to have enough
She brought some friends for whoever came with me
So, my homies sayin' that's what's up
And I hear her name's pretty from different continent
Tellin' me she's single but to tell the truth I'm not convinced
It's all good I'm used to boyfriends always talkin' shit
Thinkin' that they players but I'm coach call me Popovich
Baby I ain't doctor rich, but I'll probably show you a good night
When girls come out with me they make sure that they look right
She used to be so grounded, all of a sudden she took flight
And we ain't seen her since so tell me what does that look like
I'm the type to bring you right back down to earth
And for what it's worth I'll put that Louis on your purse
She like to wear my hat make me laugh so I'm guessin' she a keeper
I think she stole it though I keep tryin' to reach her

Baby you could wear my hat
Just make sure you give it back
Baby you could wear my hat
If you got somethin' to match

Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat
Just make sure you give it back, Just make sure you give it back
Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat
If you got somethin' to match, If you got somethin' to match that

I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat
But now she think she got it like that
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat
Damn, I think she think she got it like that</pre>
