[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, you got the best toes
Petite nose, wit a fresh glow
Hair done in a cinnamon roll
And seein' me as the God Cypher Divine, is major
For you did the knowledge, so you did me a favor
Got my mind right, back tight
Walk wit a brand new talk, ecstasy, owin' ice
It's really too much you write about me, is you
There's nothin' in this world that I won't do

[Tekitha]
You would of known you would come back out the blue
But I knew, cuz it's been years that I've known you, a young you
Strivin' for good life, true, a young you
You, you, our love can clear down through for me, you
When seasons change you came out when Cap' ran out of my face
I would share all of your pure praise, your pure praise
Shinin' upon my face, your pure praise, pure, boy
Your light is shinin' down on my face

[Chorus: Tekitha]
You, make my life right
You, challenged the flight
You, made it all right
Truth is the lights were shining leakin' through
You are my guiding light, you, you, you, you

[Tekitha]
One life to live if you're in harm, my only life, I would give
Sweetness with strength, you love it, it's my own wit
Wisdom and strength, your love, come full wit, I give
My life is your life, strength, I need it
The time has come to prove my love, and give it's wings
You taught me to rise above us, our challenge
Sincere wit eyes of love, I do trust, real love
And you complete my life, the loved one

[Chorus]

[Tekitha]
You are... you are..
You shine your light on me
Bright like The Sun
My star, and in me, you are, the one
You shine your light on me
Bright like The Sun
My star, and in me, you are, the one
You told me I was strong, told me I was wise
You told me I was love, you told me I was strong
(You) Told me to stand tall, (you) stand tall to make it all
The gifts that I posess, came from the breath above

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Tekitha]
You, you, you, you...
You, you, you, you...</pre>
