(Shaquille O'Neal)
Enter the mind of a rhyme extroadinaire
Opposition crumbles under the wear and tear 
I'm slamin emcees like Ric Flair
Chillin in the city where it's sunny but the Mic I don't share
So if you step up like a stair it's guaranteed to get hectic
Cause my style is electric like the chair 
Whoever wanna test just STOP!
Before you catch the diamond in the back with the sun roof top
If you come on stage you get got
I think I need to stop droppin roll cause I'm burnin hot
Stay grounded keep my visual pointed to the sky 
Lyrical wise keep your eardrums high my CD's you must buy
Sky rocket in pocket and my publishin points and politics
My Benz is straight strugglin, bubblin like about on the moat 
Control crowds with the flow melt the Mic like snow to get the dough

(Chorus)
(J-Flex)
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Timber the room I need space give me mad BOOM
Blowin up the spot like you blow up the bathroom
Like a lady with a bad womb brothers in producin
I got the noose around your neck and I won't loosen
Style biters title gets took like barge fighters 
Barney Rubble bomb tracks nobody can come tighter
I came to make meals and came to peel grills 
The secret of my style is concealed I still real 
You ?overcome? with comics with phonics
And under M-I-C I'm a black belt with the fifth degree
Came to California horney-a didn't know
Got a sack full of rhymes and I'm ready to unload 
Fly like an eagle or a superhero 
Watchin over the ghetto smashin the gas pedal to the floor
I'm even movin like a world tour 
Opportunity not so I kick down the door

(Chorus)
(J-Flex)
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss

(Shaquille O'Neal)
My X-ray vision see right through your skis 
You got pinto pockets and Catalac dreams 
And no game plan to put the cash in your hand
So ya grab your glock and try to take it from the next man 
No doubt the ruckus you took out like shout
With somebody quick on the draw see what you about
I chose to make my fortune from Mic scorchin
Leavin emcees stuck like two dogs in a coarsen
I save the day with eighty ways to slay
All I need is the pad eight pens to pave the way
If you want to pursue then do what you gotta do
And I'll knock yourinto two thousand-two
You'll be time travellin throw a bird javelin 
Nice, precise think twice before you're battlin (WHY?)
Cause in your city zone I pimp words like pretty Tone
The street corner is no microphone

(Chorus)
(J-Flex)
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist (everybody know)
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss (Shaq supaman)
