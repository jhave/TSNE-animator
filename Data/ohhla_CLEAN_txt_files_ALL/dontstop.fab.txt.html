[Verse 1]
It's been a year and some change
And I've been hearin' some things
That there's some motherfuckers tryin' to be me
But ain't none of these motherfuckers tryin' to see me
So I won't stop, and I don't stop, yeah

It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go
I'm hearin' muh'fucka's tryin'a steal my flow
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga J.O
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'
Now I done been so many places and seen so many faces
But none of these motherfuckers do it like me
Don't no motherfuckin' click do it like we
Guess I'm doin' the right thing like Spike Lee
See they talk like they some ho's, I walk like I'm supposed
But if they get in the way they get stepped on
It's the hundred-thou with the bling kept on
Dippin' on my semi-automatic weap-on
I ain't playin' no games, and I ain't sayin' no names
Nigga put the shoes on if they fit you
Well there's two things that I'm gon' admit to
That I won't stop, and I don't stop

[Chorus]
It don't stop
And it won't stop
And it don't stop
It don't stop, it won't stop
It don't stop
And it won't stop
And it don't stop
It don't stop, it won't stop

[Verse 2]
I take whatever come wit the wealth, and even humble myself
But I ain't the kinda nigga you can style on
I got a coupe that I'm finna' put some miles on
And I ride on these niggaz wit a smile on
See I'm 'bout stackin' money but when they start actin' funny
I fall back and all a man do is laugh
I'm the kinda player that ain't gotta do the draft
Buncha hits, couple plaques nigga do the math
But a nigga must be gone for gettin' his hustle on
So I had to come through and take the corner back
And I'm back wit the rubber bands on a stack
Nigga quit or take what I give on a pack
Girls still think I'm fly
Blow kiss and wink the eye
And tell me they wanna go somewhere and freak off
I tell 'em I would love to stop and take the week off
But I won't stop, and I don't stop

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I listen to niggaz flippin' my lines
And be grippin' my nine
Like damn niggaz flip and only spit game
Niggaz comin' at me tryin' to get names
Niggaz lookin like me tryin' to get fame
See first it didn't matter, and I was a little flattered
But now these young boys they gettin' too grown
Like I ain't show 'em how to rock jewels two toned
But it won't stop, and it don't stop
Yeah

[Chorus]

It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go
I'm hearin' muh'fucka's tryin'a steal my flow
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga J.O.
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'</pre>
