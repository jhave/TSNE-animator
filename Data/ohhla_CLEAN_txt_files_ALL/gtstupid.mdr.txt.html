[Verse 1]
When we pull up to the light, the people all stare
Four niggaz in the Benz with the dreadlock hair
Smoke everywhere, waving it madly
On the woodgrain ? with the license plate rattlin'
Doin' what we want to, hangin' out the sunroof
We mental, we ignorant, boy we go dumb dude
Gas Break Dip, we call it yokin'
Do a doughnut in yo' whip, we call it doce 'em
Get stupid, it's what we do good
Ghost ride the whip while we dancing on the hood
I'm amped feeling good, I'm hyphy
In the fish face (?) with the thizz face off of Nike
The women like me, I'm dipped in butter
I'll rob your brother, pimp the blood out your mother
I'm Mister Stupid Doo Doo Dumb
Something terrible, tell 'em how we come

[Chorus]
We S-T-U-P-I-D
When we go to the club we don't need ID
Everywhere we go it's a party y'all
We gon' get it crackin' like the mardi gras
Get stupid (X4)
Go stupid (X3), come on go stupid with me

[Verse 2]
I'm a dog, hound, Crestside clown
Gig so hard make my pants fall down
This be pound, cuddie where'd you get it?
Oh you 'idn't know, Dr. Dre did it
I come wit' it rappin' and rhyming
And dancin' pantomimin' acting like I'm drivin'
Then switch it up dance like I'm fishin'
See in the Bay Area we dance a lil' different
The Bay bounce to Thizzle
The West Coast Wizzle
Doo Doo get stupid, come fuck with Drizzle
Call the hospital he's having convulsions
No he's getting stupid and hes loaded, yokin
And is the store s'til open? We need Heen
That's a privileged thing, Ya-da-da-mean? (Yadadamean?)
All in the door like yeee! S-T-U-P-I-D

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Alrigh' let me tell you why we call this thing stupid
Cause when I dance the chick say "you stupid"
You can do it ain't that hard
Baby get dumb, act like a retard
Shake your hair make it blow in the air
You gotta get into it growl like a bear
Now say Whaaa! (Girl: What?) No, Whaaa!
Do the damn thing girl cut that shit up
Fill ya cup don't be no punk
It don't look right if you really ain't drunk
Come on now repeat after me we go S-T-U-P-I-D (Girl: Stupid? Hahaha)
