Time to get paid
Time to get, time-time to get, time to get paid
Time to get..
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid
Time to get, time to get, time to get, time to get paid
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid
Time to get, time to get, time to get, time to get paid

[DMX]
Money, money, money
Bitches, bitches, bitches
All these fucking killers but a jail full of snitches
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is
Got a crew of guerillas, start chickens like roaches?
Put niggas lights out, buenos nochas
You can go to the left, but don't lose the focus
Whatever the fuck you do, don't lose the focus
Ain't nothing changed, nigga throw them R's up
Come through on a higher boost, light them cars up
Vato's Locos, man we are nuts
You know that's us when we tear shit up
We get's it in, no muthafucking doubt
Ain't got to pop a nigga, I punch him in his mouth
Got ya soft like funeral music, cut it out
For real, fuck is all the noise about

[Biggie: Juicy Sample]

[DMX]
When you walk like a duck, I'ma treat it like a duck
If it look like pussy than it's gon get fucked
See, we get down for real, blam niggas from the truck
And we can keep talking slick but you don't get stuck
Cats making funny moves and I don't know what you up too
But keep talking slick and you gon make me say fuck you
I'm a grown ass nigga, walk alone ass nigga
Bring it to you, ain't no beefing on the phone ass nigga
Nowadays there's so much (?)
I wouldn't be surprised if there was (?)
They don't make 'em like they used to
But y'all better get used to a nigga keeping it real
Just because he choose to
They know I'm in some pain because I go against the grain
Go against the game and show a nigga that a
Throw a nigga the (?)
Keep nigga talking, Double R for life, we deep nigga, what!

[Outro - DMX]
All my life, I've been struggling
I've been struggling, but I will be alright
All my life, I've been struggling
I've been struggling, but I will be alright </pre>
