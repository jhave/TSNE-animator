Ya see I could make a mill, and don't have to sell drugs
I could smoke a roach, and do have to light bugs
I could pack a bowl, but I'm not Cheech and Chong
Not Cypress Hill, but I like hittin' bongs
I can be fat, and don't have to gain weight
I can be a legend, and don't have to be great
I don't have to take a plane to fly high
I don't wanna live my life just to die
I can be a DJ, and don't have to scratch
I could spark my cigarette with a lighter or match
I can have a gun, and I don't have to shoot
I can get a job, and try to earn a little loot
I could be a bum and live in a box
I could move to your neighborhood, stayin' on your block
I can like tricks, but I'm not a silly rabbit
I can't stop smokin' because I can't kick the habit
What is a jam if you don't come smooth?
What is a beat if you don't have a groove?
I could be the President, and legalize weed
I could grow a field of bud with a hand full of seeds
