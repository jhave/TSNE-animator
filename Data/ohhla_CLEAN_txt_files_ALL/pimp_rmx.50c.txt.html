[Hook: 50 Cent]
F-I-F-T-Y C-E-N-T and S-N double O-P

F-I-F-T-Y C-E-N-T and S-N double O-P
We internationally known and locally respected
Now I know you done heard about me
I'm a P-I-M-P

[1 - Snoop Dogg]
I don't know what you heard
But a bitch can't get a blunt up outta me
I drive a Cadillac, wear a perm cause I'm a G
And I'm a motherfuckin' C-R-I-P
I don't know what you heard
But a bitch can't get a crumb up outta me
I drive a Cadillac, wear a perm and I'm a G
And I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg]
Yeah bitch I got my Now and Later gators on
I'm bout to show you how my pimp hand is way strong
Your dead wrong if ya think that pimpin' gon' die
Twelve piece with a hundred hoes by my side
I'm down with that nigga Fifty like I down with blue
Fuck cuz, nah nigga motherfuck you
G-U-N-I-Tizzt, fuckin' with me and the D-P-Gizzy
Niggas in New York know how Doggy get down
I got my niggas in Queens, I got my bitches Uptown
I got my business in Manhattan, I ain't fuckin' around
I got some butter pecan, Peurto Ricans from the Boogie Down
That's waitin' on me to return
So they can snatch these braids out and put my shit in a perm, word
They love it when I get to crippin'
And spittin' this mag-ah-nificent pimpin'

[1 - Snoop Dogg]

[50 Cent]
It's G-Unit and the D-P-G
From New York City to the L-B-C
I'll break it down for ya, I'm a P-I-M-P
When my gun go off nigga ask about me
Nigga look what done happened since yo bitch done chose
My wrist done froze
I'll show ya how I get them hoes
I spit that G that be fuckin' with they brain
Have em' on the track when it's freezin' in the rain
Spring on a bitch with the nerve to complain
Like ??? you catch a date, you be warm
You said you want the finer things in life, you gotta go out and get it
And I'll be right here waitin' when you come back with it
Ya see I was born to break a bitch
My instructions'll make a bitch
I got me a New York Knicks, Celtics, and a Laker bitch
I got that G that make these hoes have a change of heart
I'm a natural, I been good at this from the start

[Don 'Magic' Juan]
It's goin' down now with Fifty and Big Snoop Dogg
And the archbishop, Don 'Magic' Juan
Ridin' shotgun with WhooKid
The straight up pimp is crack-a-lackin'
It's pimps up, you know it's hoes down
It's green for the money, gold for the honey
We off and we runnin'
With Fifty and Snoop Dogg and the mackelineum
Keepin' it down playa
Pimps up, you know the rest
