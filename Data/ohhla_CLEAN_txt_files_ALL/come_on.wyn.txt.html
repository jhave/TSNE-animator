Verse 1:
where my niggaz at, it's play it raw time baby
load up the guns guerilla war time baby
light up the blunts, light up the block time dawg
choppers with drums, ozzee's, and glock time dawg
whoever he with, they better stay cause they to nice
and whoever and hit, jump out the window and get it right
then we run in his house and hit the body and haul them out
then we empty the clip and let the Lord sort em out
bust it really, it ain't no stopping me cause i hang up to that ville
and now i'm tieing on my bandanna and i'm cocking back
jump out the Hummer and say lil shorty wear your stocking cap
dawg we got automatics, two shooters, six shots, and 50 round drums
hit your daddy, you suki, you son, your wife and move your momma
cause i'm off the wall, off the hook, off the chain
got a sawd oil tec and i'm bout to knock off your brain

got a sawd oil tec and i'm bout to knock off your brain
