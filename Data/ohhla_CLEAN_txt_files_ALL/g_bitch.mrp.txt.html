Song:   Gangsta Bitch
Typed by: timbaland01@juno.com

Chorus (2x):

If she ain't a gangsta bitch 
Then I don't want her don't want her
And if she ain't a gangsta bitch 
Then I don't need her 
You can keep her

Master P:

I need a bitch to hold my stash, a bitch to give me some ass
And when I'm on the run I need a hoe to send me some cash
I'm a ball 'til I fall and that's the first right
I need a bitch to watch my house while I live the streetlife
And I know it sound crazy
I want a gangsta bitch to have my baby
And pack a 380
And ride calm by the po-pos with dope in the Mercedes
And known to be a lady
And massage me with hennessy and weed when she bathe me

Chorus (2x)

Steady Mobbin' #1:

She gotta be a gangsta bitch bout that gangsta shit
I'm living this gangsta life doing this mob-style shit
I smash like Clyde but need that Bonnie on the side
To hold my straps and busts caps at niggas naps
We can sip hen be homies and best friends
Smash off X-O get his and hers M-10's
Collect my cash, conduct yourself with class
Get respect from my soldiers everytime you pass
When I can't be seen you can inform my team
Call that shot to keep the block on pop
And can pop, more chickens than K-F-C
Lay down organize crime be my d-o-g

Chorus (2x)

Steady Mobbin' #2:

I need a gangsta bitch, I need a gangsta gimp
I need a top notch shorty to hold my clip
And don't be afraid to fall in love with a thug
All you get from this lesson baby girl is true love
She was dapping me, coronel, on my jump when I was locked down
My black queen's sendin' me Lex to the carpound
She see me now she closer than my bitch
She my boo cause she down to do some gangsta shit
And if a bitch trip
She down to boot her for free
My little mama go to work everyday
I run the streets she's a G bitch

Chorus (2x)
