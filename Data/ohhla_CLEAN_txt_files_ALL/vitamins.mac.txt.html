Well

Take your vitamins

Well I was on my way to meet up with this woman that I met the other day
While I was on my break, smokin' cigarettes
I hit her up, she had some weed and told me "come through, we should smoke"
Bring a pair of Lungs dont bring no money, baby I aint broke
So I'm walkin' up the stairs to the porch
Knocked against the door, heard some feet against the floor
The door had opened up and it was her
She told me hurry, come right in
Leave your shoes up by the FRONT CAUSE we just put new carpets in
She asked me 'bout my day and sat me down told me we should have some fun
There ain't nobody around
She got this crazy pill the other day when she was on her way to work
Told me it will make my problems go away and fix the hurt
That I had, well, that don't sound bad, down the hatch
Kinda nervous, just relax, she said rubbing on my back
Well I ain't really into drugs but fuck it
I'm a take a trip and I'm a love it (love it)

I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free
It took me to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back

Well I left right after that and started driving to my house where I reside
I was high and possibly a little fucked up in my mind
Can't remember where I live, it ain't like I just bought this house
I said fuck it, took a breath, opened my door and just jumped out
And it's funny cause I didn't even hit against the road
I just went right through the ground and started floatin' on my own
I see colors, different colors, like they glowin' in the light
They was glowin' like they glowin' in the dark but it was bright
That's alright, this shit crazy, what the fuck she had me take
If this kill me I'm a come back, haunt her every single day
As I wait, sittin' somewhere that I've never seen
Feel like I'm forever dream, just imagine, set a scene
Power in imagination, got all my surroundings changing
Found a place to drown my brain to something like it's outer space
But nothing like the pictures of the astronauts they show me back at school
When they told me drugs were bad, oh man, oh man they had me fooled

I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free
It took me to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back

[Excerpt from "Requiem For A Dream"]
I'm somebody, now, Harry. Everybody likes me
Soon, millions of people will see me, and they'll all like me
It's a reason to get up in the morning
It's a reason to smile
It makes tomorrow alright</pre>
