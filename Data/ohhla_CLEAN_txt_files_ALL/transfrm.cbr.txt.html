[Verse One] [Lil Wayne]
Go hey lil mama
I can transform ya
No, I can't dance but I can dance on ya
Swizz on the beat
Chris move ya feet
And baby I can transform your "him" to a "me"
I can change you life
Make it so new
Make you never want to go back to the old you
Ciroc and lime
Give it little time
And she gon' transform like Optimus Prime

[Chris Brown]
Need a ride I can Range you up
Money I can change you up
You can ride your own, no longer be the passenger
Swag low, I build you up
Knees weak, I can stand you up
Red lips, red dress, like 'em like a fire truck

[Chorus]
What you need, you can have that
My black card they won't decline that
See potential in ya
Let me mold that

I can transform ya
I can transform ya
I can transform ya
I can transform ya
Anything ya want, I can get it for ya
You're my baby girl so you know I did it for ya
I can trans, I can trans, I can transform ya

Shoes you got it (got it)
Bags you got it (got it)
Cars you got it (got it)
Money still got it (got it)
I can transform ya, I can transform ya
Anything you want I can I can get it for ya

[Verse Two]
See me in the video you can have it really though
Iced out everything
Frigid like an eskimo
Wanna fly, we can go
Anywhere you wanna go
Jimmy Choos in Italy
Louie V in Tokyo
Something like Pinocchio
If you lie then I'ma grow
Wanna see me do it big
I can show you how it goes
Take you from an amateur to being a professional
(I can have you swag surfing)

[Chorus]
What you need, you can have that
My black card they won't decline that
See potential in ya
Let me mold that

I can transform ya
I can transform ya
I can transform ya
I can transform ya
Anything ya want, I can get it for ya
You're my baby girl so you know I did it for ya
I can trans, I can trans, I can transform ya

Shoes you got it (got it)
Bags you got it (got it)
Cars you got it (got it)
Money still got it (got it)
I can transform ya, I can transform ya
Anything you want I can I can get it for ya

[Verse Three] [Lil Wayne]
Okay
I can transform ya like a transformer
I can turn you from a human to a Carter
Take you off the bench 
T-turn ya to a starter
Then take you home and put you on a charger
Th-then my cars transforms to a charter
And we can fly to wherever you ever thought of
Haha
I take you to where it's warmer
Then I gotta rip off your dress like a warm up
Haha
But I'm just getting warmed up
So tell your man he better get his Voltron up
I transform her to a Ducati 
And then I transform me to a Bugatti
Cause her form put's me in a trance
I transform smaller and she puts me in her pants
Swi-Swizz on the beat
Chris move ya feet
And Weezy transform a good girl to a freak

[Chorus]
I can transform ya
I can transform ya
I can transform ya
I can transform ya
Anything ya want, I can get it for ya
You're my baby girl so you know I did it for ya
I can trans, I can trans, I can transform ya

Shoes you got it (got it)
Bags you got it (got it)
Cars you got it (got it)
Money still got it (got it)
I can transform ya, I can transform ya
Anything you want I can I can get it for ya</pre>
