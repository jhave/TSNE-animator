Song:   The Room That We Hide In
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm not a person of my words anymore
I exist inside the dream that was started by a child that now lives
Inside of me
I can't play anymore I'm falling off the edge
I'm fighting every urge I've ever had to strike
It down and leave it dead
I make music, pain made me wanna take to it, fate drew it right in front your
Muthuhfuckin face use it, right? But there's a different way
you view my life so meet me in the middle and
Throw rocks from the room you hide in
I get inside it, how sicks it's mind that it's got me reaching out to
Something like it thought that I was trying to find it
Lost and it's harder than expected, spotlights burn
The side of me that shouldn't be affected
And I try to be simple, don't put me on a pedastle
I'm twice
As fucked as everyone and scared like all the rest of you
Please, all I want is peace when the sunsets, and to
Breathe and taste what hasn't come yet
Listen to my words

[Chorus]
Once upon a time, a long time ago before I lost my mind
I was fine, I was good, I was faithful, but now I'm crazy
And I'm lost and I hate you
Because you took it all away from me

Once upon a time, a long time ago before I lost my mind
I was fine, I was good, I was faithful, but now I'm crazy
And I'm lost and I hate you
Because you took it all away from me

I chose my own path and left home without a roadmap
dressed for sunshine, I should have known better to pack
For those days that would turn rainy, cold, and black
See I heard the stories but I didn't know the facts
I assumed all was perfect from the photographs
until the light hit the surface to expose the cracks
What's worse than not knowing if your still on track?
Paranoid and having thoughts about turning back
I've seen dreams transform into the worst disease
and almost let the doubt kill my will to succeed
But, I've traveled too far to turn around and leave
get angry pound my fist into the ground and bleed
I'll, never break my creed to sit at a table with thieves
tricks up their sleeves saying how my music should be
I keep on with the profits and build it with Grieves
knowing one day I'll prove what I've always believed
Eventually I know that day will be ceased, I know that day will be ceased

[Chorus]
Once upon a time, a long time ago before I lost my mind
I was fine, I was good, I was faithful, but now I'm crazy
And I'm lost and I hate you
Because you took it all away from me

Once upon a time, a long time ago before I lost my mind
I was fine, I was good, I was faithful, but now I'm crazy
And I'm lost and I hate you
Because you took it all away from me</pre>
