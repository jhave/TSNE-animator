[50 Cent]
Yeah, Shady, Aftermath
I - guess - you didn't know
I - be - back for more
Every-body's - on the floor
Goin goin outta control
Set it off on yo' left, dog
Set it off on yo' right, dog
Set it off
Nigga I said set it off! (Set-set-set set it off)

[50 Cent]
Ha ha...
Sick with it, boy better get with it, what?
In the club I get it goin, goin, uh
Just movin to the music it's on
And the sounds of 50 and D-R-E
Everything's calculated and sound precise
Another move another mill', let's get right aight?
Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life
Feelin lucky enough to bet it all on the dice
Shorty do what you wanna do, hit the dancefloor
And move how you wanna move, later on
we can cruise if you wanna cruise, it's whatever you want
The fact is I got more than I flaunt, yeah

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I do my thang, in the club
Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dancefloor jampacked, look
I got 'em goin goin outta control
Set it off on yo' left, dog
Set it off on yo' right, dog
Set it off
Nigga I said set it off! (Set-set-set set it off)

[50 Cent]
System thumpin, dancefloor jumpin
We 30 deep in this bitch, we stuntin
That's what you get, you in my hood
"I thought you understood" - you know me
V.I.P., no ID
Bottles of DP, I do it real B-I-G
Bitches break their neck to be where I be
Take 'em to ecstasy, without ecstasy
I'm a chef you need the hit I got the recipe
Doc got the antidote, it's in the drugs and the notes
Can you feel it?  Em said for me to make you feel it
And remind you that you rockin with the realest

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I'm hot boy, I'm burnin up
I do my thang in the club with the burner tucked
'Til the speakers all blown, we gon' turn it up
And do that damn thang, yeah do that mayne
Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
Get to poppin and shakin that thing on the flo'
A little dose of it, now I want some more
Nobody put that thang on me like that before
I be a fiend for it, it's the way you move
But I ain't payin for it, cause I ain't no fool
If you okay with it, tonight I stay with it
Hit the telly play with it in a major way get it

[Chorus]</pre>
