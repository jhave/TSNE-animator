Verse 1:

What I gotta ball?
Just to get all up in them draws
And get the Benz with the 20' inch Lorenz's
And put TV's in it and all
Shit, cause these my dawgs and dem
Keep letting me know
You ain't ready for that
Don't hang in the hood no mo'
Guess you too heavy for that
Don't even go to school ho
Thinking everything is cool ho
I made up a name especially for you ho
A noodle
Look bad with the Prada bags
Take it in the mouth or the ass (mouth or the ass)
Only see the Benz's and the Jags
Anything less than that you gotta show her some cash
Cause every nigga with bread you probably done fucked 'em
And anybody in the game who doing they thing

Waiting on me like I'm yo WIC
Bitch please
You still waiting

Ol' foot dragging ass, nasty stinking ass bitch
Stop worrying about what I got and get yo own shit

All you good for is some head and a back massage
A lil' suck and fuck when I nut up, cut up, shut up, bitch get up
What up
Its bad for me on some nuttin ass hoes keep harassing me
On how I do
It don't pertain to you
So bitch stop asking me
Now pardon me on the words I used
See young ladies ought to be excused
And when u see one
Point that noodle out so my dawgs don't get confused
I'm talking bout
