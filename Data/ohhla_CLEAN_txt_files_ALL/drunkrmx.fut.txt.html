Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I've been drinking, I been drinking
I'm off that vodka ain't no telling what a while
Nigga thinking what he thinking, yeah
Ain't no thoughts all I know is
I won't judge you no I...
Baby I won't judge you
Ain't no police around here baby I won't judge you
Wee-ow-wee wee-ow-wee
Drunk in love
That's how ya feelin', that's how ya feelin'
And I'm decided 'bout your comfort level while I'm drilling, while I'm drilling
Fuck them bands girl me and you going for a million and a billion
And I can't keep my fucking eyes off you
I won't switch you, no no
Just tryin' creep but your boyfriend here he won't let you

[Bridge]
We woke up in the kitchen screaming 'how this shit happen to us?' oh baby
Drunk in love
One thing I remember that beautiful body off inside one club
Drunk in love

[Verse 2]
Get the flame in that lighter
You gon' get the pussy and diaper
You done got me all inside her
When a nigga get the pussy I bite her
You call me the young Mike Tyson
Ay, I'm pouring that drink on top of you
And I'mma sip it all off of you
Sip, sip, sip
Sipping on some champagne
Fucking up the bitch brain
Changing up your last name
Fucking in my gold chains (woo)
Got you higher than an airplane
You get that hyping on that dick, Soul Train
Mix that Spade in that syrup
If I do say so myself
I pour a cup of dirty Sprite
And I drink it by myself
Pussy soaking like some ally water
Did it on the steps
We done did it everywhere
And them other place that's left
