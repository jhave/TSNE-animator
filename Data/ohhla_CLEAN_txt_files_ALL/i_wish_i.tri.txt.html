Chorus: 1x Shonie
I wish I never met you boy..
And its killing me to know that I can't have you in my world
I wish I never met you boy..
If I could turn back time, then I make it so that you were my boo
I wish I never met you boy..
Everytime I'm with my man, all I do is sit and think of you
Don't wanna feel the way I feel about you
 
Verse 1: Trina
When we first got together I saw us chillin' forever
A lifetime bestfriend for worse or for better
Then you switched up the weather, sunshine to clouds
I found a condom in your dresser and you know how we get down
You fuckin' clown now I wish I never met you
I should've listened to mama, she said you wasn't nothin' special
So now its to the left, to the left...
And everything you own is on the porch, nigga step!
And tell me...
 
(Shonie)
What would you do if you were in my shoes?
Would you make it work or would you wanna choose?
Between the one you love and between the one you hate
'Cause thats just how it is...
 
Chorus: 1x
 
Verse 2: Trina
Maybe I'm trippin', or I just can't figure you out
One night you say you love me, the next you flippin' out
But you can bounce, you know I don't need a man
I'm sorry I met you I could do bad by my damn self
I can't let you disrespect me, I'ma queen..
And all my real boss chicks know what I mean
I bet you still trickin', you ain't learned your lesson
Now let me check your text messages...hahaa
Now tell me...
 
(Shonie)
What would you do if you were in my shoes?
Would make it work or would you wanna choose?
Between the one you love and between the one you hate
'Cause that's just how it is...
 
Chorus: 1x
 
(Shonie)
Picture me and you together
Everything about you make my whole body shiver..
It's you I want in my world
It's you that I adore
 
I said I picture me and you together
Everything about you make my whole body quiver...
It's you that I want in my world
It's you that I adore
