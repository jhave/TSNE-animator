[Verse one rp2x]
all my niggas who be chargin
bitches and ya got blue beads fallin
out yo glass ol' man dont wantcha
in the club till ya start hoppin startin
fights in the club if ya come through
and you in a car niggas might know that you a star
if ya come wit 4 or 5 hoes down to fight
anything straight out the doors
all my niggas who be chargin
bitches and ya got blue beads fallin
out yo glass ol' man dont wantcha
in the club till ya start hoppin startin
fights in the club if ya come through
and you in a car niggas might know that you a star
if ya come wit 4 or 5 hoes down to fight
anything straight out the doors
