[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Can you count?
Cuz Bitches
Same old shit
Different town
Same old shit dogg (they got money, they holla and shit)
My nigga Ke'Noe
Yeah, you know these hoes and shit
You know a nigga talk bad about 'em
Check this out nigga
Pull up a chair

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
It's like, every time I turn around
It seems some clown is pulling me down
Snakes, cut throats, and short dough
And all kind of traps that's made for po folks
No joke, now you could quote what I say
If I may, display dialogue
So come on dog, we like to hustle and ball
From the streets to the suites, what's your name baby doll?
Get in, sit in, where you fit in
All that ass first class, baby slid in
In cool with Snoop and now we groovin up the blocks
Headed up the spot and now we bout to get T'ka
Just because she fly, doesn't mean she's not a rag
Betta hit the liquor store and get some Jimmy hags
Cold game ain't it, especially when you famous
These bitches out to get ya for your cash, that's what they game is
Ke'Noe

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't Shit
I said it before and I say again
Nigga, shit bitches ain't shit
They only fuckin with a nigga cuz a nigga got bread

[Verse 2: Ke'Noe]
My uncle Snoopy told me nephew watch out for these hoes
They call me cute but that shit don't even matter no more
I'm like new money, when they come through they be catching a fit
We call 'em gold diggers and groupies, cause they loving a dick
Now follow me as I take you back to my life as a mack
I was a scardy little nigga wearing baseball caps
And every girl up in the city knew that I had snaps
I used to slam niggaz wives and they gon take me to nap
They like a G with the big bank and tight ass ride
They like to smoke up all your weed and try to ruin your hide
I been a mack baby, since I was 10 years old
And now i'm in my early 20's now, i'm still mackin these hoes
I'm a million dollar nigga, so I treats myself
They oughta ban gold diggin cuz it's bad for your health
Snoop, you the player of the year so i'm the mack of the year
That's the end of my freestyle, and i'm out this biatch

[Chorus 2x: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't Shit
I said it before and I say again
Nigga, shit bitches ain't shit
They only fuckin with a nigga cuz a nigga got bread

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg, Ke'Noe]

All a part of my freaky tales

[Snoop Dogg]
Don't tell dogg, keep it on the low low
Said it was your first time, bitch you's a professional

[Ke'Noe]
Soon I listen I call Snoop on the celly
Then I ditched that bitch at the fuckin' telly

[Snoop Dogg]
Cum on her belly, pussy smelly

[Ke'Noe]

And we never hesitate to put a foot up your ass, Biatch

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
