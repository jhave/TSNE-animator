"Somebody warn the west, nigga ain't runnin"

"The Legend of Nigga in color, rated PG"

[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Uh...yeah..Fa sho'
Niggaz be comin at me like,
"Yo, yo Fred man... You a real nigga, dawg"
Real nigga (Real nigga)
I be like (from front to the back), "Respect man"
(Respect) These fake niggaz done lowered the bar, ynahmsayin?

[Freddie Gibbs]
Niggaz be like "Fred, you ain't never lied"
Fuck the rap shit my gangsta is solidified
Still do my bih'ness on the side
Bitch if you police-ses, then pay me no nevermind
I was thuggin -- Black and red laces in my number 3s'
Take a pull up off the wood and let that motherfucker breathe
Sit outside a busta crib and let that motherfucker leave
Walk his ass back in and put him on his motherfuckin knees
Thuggin -- Never takin no for an answer
Might just take a loss but bitch I'd rather take my chances
This liquor got me lurkin where you livin in the night time
59Fifty to the left but I'm in my right mind
Thuggin -- Pants gon' be saggin 'til I'm forty
Still lyrically sharper than these "+ShawtBusShawtys+
Them phonies ain't gon' throw me in this minstrel show
These labels see how far up in they mouth my dick could go
So gon' and, choke on this meat and throw my song on repeat
Might move away one day but I'm always gon' belong to the streets
I'm straight thuggin

[Chorus]
And it feels so good, uh and it feels so right 
Yeah, and it feels so good uh, and it feels so right
Cause motherfucker I'm thuggin

[Freddie Gibbs]
Sellin you the science of the street rap
Every motherfuckin show I do is off the meat rack
I done been in jail and did my best not to repeat that
I'm tryna feed my family, give a fuck about yo' feedback
Critically acclaimed, but that shit don't mean a thang
When you rockin mics and still in microwaves cookin 'caine
Never trickin on a dame, I'm too cold for you broke hoes
Don't let the knob hitcha booty when the door close, BITCH~!
She let me hit it cause I'm thuggin
Squares need not apply, I'm so fly I might fuck her cousin
Swiftly 'bout to stick a sweet dick in ya sweetheart
Then get some groceries off, might geek a EBT card
Why the Feds worried 'bout me clockin on this corner
when there's politicians out here gettin popped in Arizona
Bitch, I'm thuggin'

[Chorus]

[Freddie Gibbs]
Yo, yo, we're not against rap, but we're against those thugs
Can't be legit when every nigga in ya clique sold drugs
Predicate felons in my faculty, real killers can vouch for me
Teach a kid at the crib or your children might cop an ounce from me
And smoke out in the Chevy with us, cause in the past
My low-class black ass would serve my own fuckin family members
I hate to say it, ain't no need to be discreet
If she don't cop from me, she get it from a nigga up the street
Cause he thuggin -- And yo she'd probably suck his dick for it
She turned out so it ain't shit to turn a trick for it (That's a bitch)
My uncle last bitch, put him on the glass dick
Tried to rob a man to feed his habit, he got blasted
I live on borrowed time, my expiration date I past it
So lock me up forever, but this shit is everlasting
I'm thuggin

[Chorus]
