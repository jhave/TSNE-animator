(Tone Loc)
Attention all ladies
The Candyman is on the prowl
And for those that wanna get busy
You gots to speak up now

(Candyman)
This rhyme, this time
Is one of a kind, blowing yo mind
Like only the Candyman can
Like a heavyweight champion
Knockin'em out, another bout without a doubt
Once again you can scream and shout
When I rock the bells
Yell out my name
This is what you've been missing
Listen to my heart beat, while I'm whispering
I know your suffering
So sweet a Candyman sweet nothings
Hugging and tugging and rubbing
Loving it all, having a ball
All ya'll girlies next to me
Talking sex to me
We can't do that yet, but I bet will chill
(Candyman telling'em the truth)
Will still end up knockin the boots

(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you

(Candyman)
At each and every show, thers's this groupie
Artis knows what she wants to do to me
She knows my name, knows every rap routine
But how she get in my limousine
Don't act fool, don't drool
I'm just a performer
I was cool but the room got warmer
Norma cornered me in
Her and a friend named Llynn, then
They checked me in to the Holiday Inn
I didn't let'em win, said my pockets was thin
She blew me a kiss
I knew she wasn't new to this
I didn't want to, but the devil made me do it
To the tic-toc ya don't stop
We knock boots till 6 o'clock, as we lay
All night long
And early in the morning she sang this song

(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
(Girl I do)

(Candyman)
Tunnel of love is what I'm entering
When I mention it, you're surrending
Giving it up like a good girl has to
Living it up
Eventually you ask to stay
You're gonna pay for this
Just rest your breast on my chest, yes I'm impressed
With the way you cold love me down
I don't wanna sit down, I just wanna get down
I'm on the ground, down on my knees
Like James Brown singing Please, Please
Round two, I'm down to
Do, what it takes to make you
Understand I'm the Candyman
And I melt in your mouth, not in your hands
Hard as rock, yes I'm no sucka
The boots I knock make me one bad mutha
(Unh Unh...giggling) *2

Knockin, while I'm a hip-hoppin
Many people say my lyrics are shocking
Just because of the simple subject
Everyone should love this
Cause everybody does it
Whether they admit it or if they deny it
You betta keep quite
Or else you might have to see a few skeletons
But girl thats irrevelent
Break out the bottle of Vosties per Monte
Pop off the top and rock wit my posse
Fila Al, Big Dill, and D Fly
We ask the questions, you give the reply
MC Chip, Big Rob and Bud
Rockin on the waterbed, knockin on the rugs
I'm just playing, what I'm saying ain't ill
Girl you should know I'm real
(Unh Unh..giggling) *2</pre>
