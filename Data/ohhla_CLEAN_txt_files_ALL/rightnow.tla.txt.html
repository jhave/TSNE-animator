I want it right now baby
I think I want to you much
And if you don't know what to do
Let me show you what to do wit it

Verse 1:
It was this chick named Latasha met her at the Cashab
She was no one doin a dance I'm like Latasha
Dis da wanna knocka I know it's kinda aqua
Yea I know I'm a balla but cho'll I kinda like ya
When I met her I was to high rollin a new ride
But she didn't give a damn about that cause I was to fly
Switchin lanes ova in a Range Rova got the name ova, change ova, then I came
ova
She got her own place on safe
Crome face hole lace she got new way taste
I'm like damn can't believe what you doin to me
Proceede to give me the weed to make my chest bleed

Verse 2:
My girl Cheng Chang with the gold rang
Half black japanese lived in japan
Just came back from greece doin big thangs
Had a shoe with a lee, that's what Lidge claim
Sex on the beach dinner with the flame
What we wearin this weak lynon by Caron
Glarin starin at the views in sight
Bermuda wit skubas gonna smash tonight
So I drink a little rim take a little swim
Make a little film can you shake it like a limb
No lights on him candles keep it dim
Take you to the gym and work you out like a pimp
Icing on the cake for the escape
Baby wait come here look at the moon make love to the lake
Feelin great pas porse out the steak
Me and my date we some heavy weights, a steady weight....

Chorus: x7
I think I want to you much
And if you don't know what to do
Let me show you what to do wit it</pre>
