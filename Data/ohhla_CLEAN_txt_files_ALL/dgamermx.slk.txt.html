Chorus: 
What's up playa? You looking slick with that 
Hundred G chain with the bracelet to match 
Check this out here whodi lay on the ground 
For I show your clown ass how the hot boys sound 
They going click click blow, blow click click blow, 
Click click blow, blow click click blow 
Click click blow, blow click click blow 
Click click blow, blow that's my style 

Verse 1: 
Popping wit terror take it straight to guns 
Or we could keep it corporate give up your block and run 
Too much paper here to try and count my ones 
Over here cross me our hollow wall is young 
For our haters on the streets tryin to measure my blow 
If you've seen the new whip know they add nine 0's 
Now I'm up to 2 bricks, a seventy two 0's 
If you counting by the whips than it's eight different flows 
I'm heavy luva, with the diamonds and broads 
Too heavy luva, with the cocaine and cars 
And what I hop in, it's my option 
To shift the mash quit tryin to get in the dash 

Chorus: 
What's up playa? You looking slick with that 
Hundred G chain with the bracelet to match 
Check this out here whodi lay on the ground 
For I show your clown ass how the hot boys sound 
They going click click blow, blow click click blow, 
Click click blow, blow click click blow 
Click click blow, blow click click blow 
Click click blow, blow that's my style 

Verse 2: 
Now if it's on with the bricks and the bag BABY 
You come short, I'm a bust your head BABY 
They name a dope man whodi 
Yeah that's me, I'm out that 5-0-4 plus that C-P-3 
Give me an ounce and I'ma flip it to a brick figga 
You got my scratch, if you snitching you a trick figga 
Hit the pen, you probably gonna be a misfigga 
So here's a glock for your chest I mean your tits trigga 

Imagine, all the bricks in the projects smeared with cocaine 
I be the richest young soldier in this rap game 
All my money come in armor trucks 
More cars, more houses, more freaks to pluck 
You wasn't work, when I was local playa 
I'm worldwide, you haters can't take it you petrified 
Then let me lose after I reveal thuggin with p 
It's no limit till I die y'all can't get with me 

Chorus: 
What's up playa? You looking slick with that 
Hundred G chain with the bracelet to match 
Check this out here whodi lay on the ground 
For I show your clown ass how the hot boys sound 
They going click click blow, blow click click blow, 
Click click blow, blow click click blow 
Click click blow, blow click click blow 
Click click blow, blow that's my style 

Verse 3: 
I don't like violence but ha that's no shy logic 
Don't like material stuff either, but sho got a lot of it 
Just to make money off tha street na, I make it off the beat 
Walk my rott off the leash right off the beach 
Talking shit I'ma big spinner so I don't really talk to much 
Got guns, really big ones, think rap softens us up 
See I love my fans but I don't love them haters 
I don't really like the fame much dog 
But I show love to paper uh-huh 
I want something bigger cause I love the dough 
Niggas talk shit, Shaq's out 
Leave them looking like Mugsy Bogues 
Zoom Zoom, 1100's I still ride it slow 
Not the type that's gonna floss 
But I ain't gonna hide it though 
Learn the game from my big brother 
C-E-O now, Made Man, Shocker well..C-E-O sounds 
We the type dog, go to sleep, wake up and ball 
You know what's up what us 
Now what's up with y'all, uh-ha 

Chorus: 
What's up playa? You looking slick with that 
Hundred G chain with the bracelet to match 
Check this out here whodi lay on the ground 
For I show your clown ass how the hot boys sound 
They going click click blow, blow click click blow, 
Click click blow, blow click click blow 
Click click blow, blow click click blow 
Click click blow, blow that's my style
