[Intro]
So I met, this girl, at the club
And I just wanted, her, to suck my dick
and that's cause
(She's a boppin' bitch) {*4X*}
Now she's drunk, and talkin, to me a lot
Until we go, to, another room
and that's cause
(She's a boppin' bitch) {*4X*}

[Tyler, the Creator]
This little slut whore, sucks cock for
a little more bucks than them other sluts fuck for, real easy
Cause I didn't even knocked on the front door
I used the welcome mat as a cum rag
And all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she's a cum bag
Filled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store
Four more +Dora+ lookin sluts let me +Explore+
until my cock got sore and started growing cold sores

[Chorus]
Now she thinks, that, I like her
But all I really, wanted, was that mouth
and that's cause
(She's a boppin' bitch) {*4X*}
Now she text messages me, every day
And I don't ever, hit, that bitch back
and that's because... that's because
(She's a boppin' bitch) {*4X*}

[Tyler, the Creator]
This little hoodrat, started jockin at my jock strap
until my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped
Flappin up and down until the cack finally go splat
Now you gotta spat and spit it out until you do scat
Then you gotta sat and shit it out {*pbt*} Ungh~!
Bitch, fuck yo' feelings
You wasn't feelin shit when you was down there kneelin
Now shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with

[Interlude]
Now, now why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')
Wait, tell him why we can't fuck with this bitch? (That bitch she boppin')
What is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')
She, what do she be doin? (She boppin')

[Chorus]
Now I'm at, a, fuckin clinic
Cause my dick is, swollen, and keeps itchin
Nigga, I'ma kill this bitch
(She's a boppin' bitch) {*3X*}

[Outro]
Where's my gun? (She boppin')
I'ma kill this bitch (that bitch is boppin')
To all my niggaz out there listenin
That bitch (she boppin')
And don't let her suck your dick
or you'll get hurt</pre>
