[Lauryn - Singing]
Can you tell me how to get......how to get to Sesame Street?
(Check it out, here we go!) - Wyclef

[Lauryn- Singing (Chorus)]
Be yourself (Just be yourself)
Easy as A-B-C (A-B-C)
Can't be no one else ( No one else!)
Just happy to be me! (Yeah! Yeah!)

[Wyclef]
Hey yo, the "A" is for achievement

[Prakazrel "Pras]
Hey yo, the "B" is for beneficent

[Wyclef]
And the "C" is for committment

[Pras]
And the "D" is for diligent

[Wyclef]
What about the "E", the "F", the "G", the "H", the "I", the "J?!"
I'm in my P.J.'s, I'm drinkin' O.J.! Ha Ha!

[Lauryn]
The big city, just like I pictured it (What?!)
Millions of people rushing around real quick (Real quick!)
Each one's originale, one of a kind, unique (That's right!)
So, kick back and listen while L-Boogie speaks (While L-Boogie speaks!)
Not trying to be different, just doing they own thing (Own thing!)
So come on everybody, clap your hands and sing (Just sing!)

[Chorus 2x]

[Pras]
Hey yo, the "K", the "L", the "M", the "N", the "O", the "P"
for "Prakazrel" in the place to be!

[Wyclef]
Hey yo, the "Q's" for quiet

[Pras]
The "R" for riot

[Wyclef]
The "S", the "T", the "U", the "V's" for vowels (Vowels!) - Prakazrel
The "W", "X", the "Y", the "Z's" for Zorro! Yo! See you tomorrow!

[Pras] 
Yeah, fly like an eagle...
Well it's the Fugees
On Sesame, clap your hands do a dance with L-Jiggity!

[Lauryn]
Now Snuffy and Big Bird are having a good time (Time!)
They're walking and gawking and trying to talk to a mime (walking-n-gawking),
here, in the square where they just seen it all
But they ain't never seen a yellow bird (What?!) seven feet tall! (Seven feet
tall!)

[Chorus 2x]

[Wyclef]
It's a lovely day in my neighborhood...
It's all good...
Prakazrel, L-Boogie up in here....
In my neighborhood

[Pras]
Refugee Camp Allstars....yeah....yeah</pre>
