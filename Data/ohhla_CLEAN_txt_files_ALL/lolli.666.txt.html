[Verse One]
Now lawdy lawdy lawdy (lawdy) please Lord have some mercy (mercy)
This girl is throwin Judy (Judy) I think she 'bout to hurt me (hurt me)
See she went front to back (back) then she went side to side (side)
My thumb up like hitchhikers (hikers) I think I need a ride (ride)
One pocket full of pills (pills) and a little bag of that cola (cola)
The other one full of weed (weed) and a semi auto pistol-a (tol-a)
See I ain't no dancin dude (dude) but I can lean like a cholo (cholo)
See ma you go with me cause I can't be goin home solo (solo)
Ya dig?

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
They call me the Juice when I'm at the strip club
I put down a hundred or a du-uh-uh-uhhhb
It don't matter to a player I'm a stu-uh-uh-uhhhd
Cause when I leave the club I'ma fu-uh-uh-uhhhck
You can ride with the mayne if you givin up the brain
Little scared to ride wit'cha I don't even know your name
There's a whole lotta room in the front of the Range
Like Barack Obama said yeah it's time for a change
Pull over on the road on the back seat (back seat)
Pop that body now you got me (got me)
You a fine chick kinda classy (classy)
Said her name was Tina, now I'm grabbin (grabbin)
Cuz she got grip on the whip
With her big round booty with the silicone tits
See she bouncin on my lap and she tryin to unzip
I whispered in her ear "Yeah +It's Hard For a Pimp+"

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
All my ladies with a body, put yo' hands in the URR
Youse a good lookin hottie, put yo' hands in the URR
Project Pat, lookin for a model, poppin that booty, I'ma pop bottles
Your girl's a cutie, know she gargles, don't get mad, I keep them hollows
Shorty hot, watch her rock, let me see that lolli pop
Body rock, don't you stop, I love the way that booty drop
Sideways, front back, up and down I like that
Cherry lolli, chocolate lolli, I wanna see you pop that lolli

[Chorus]</pre>
