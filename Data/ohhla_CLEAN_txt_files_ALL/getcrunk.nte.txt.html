Yeah that's what I need, to get a nigga buzzed
I does the damn thang, y'all can't hang
I'm falling asleep off this drank, that me and my homie drank
Give me two pints of that syrup, two pints of the swisha
And mix it together, and assort the conditions
Sprite me up po' me up, po' me up (po' up)
All my motherfucking niggaz, throwing up (po' up)
She's a girl that I love the most, Mary Jane
Fuck it I'm hooked, so we just spark the flame
Light the candle blaze it up, because we doing it right
She got the kush she got the bomb, she got me high as a kite
I roll it tight, inhale it with all my might
Look at my eyes hypnotized, and done blind my sight

Bitch I ain't fronting, you got what I want

[Hook]

[D-Red]

Fuse box in the back, full of endo
On a cloud in the town, that's how we play yo
That's how we ball bro, yeah it's them boys and we back in the lane
Aiming for your fitted cap, yeah slashing your fame
For playing games, you got us fucked up and tucked up

But on some playa shit, we keep it bossy homie

Botany is the block, the block that stay crunk mayn
We keep it cracking, cause we love stacking hell-a-change

And keep it gutter keep it real, cause I'm a team player
And stay crunk at all times, full of Henn yeah

Don't want you niggaz round me, sniffing them drugs
