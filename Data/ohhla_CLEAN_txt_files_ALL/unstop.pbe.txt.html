[Flavor Flav]
Aiyyo man, ya yo yo yo
I'm tryin ta stay away from it but it won't stay away from me

[KRS-One]
You better ask yourself
What do you want, what do you need, what will you find
Don't be afraid, don't fall asleep, open your mind
I hope this rhyme gets you in time and space, come to a different place
Where you hear spiritual lyrical knowledge and you're face to face
like welfare, and these rappers lyrics they need help there
Does KRS represent heaven?  Hell yea
Let me take you elsewhere, where you stand, there's a curse there
for sure, unless you're mature, grow up
If you're immature, then you're livin sinister
You reject the words of the minister
You better get witcha Qu'Ran or bible, you won't be livin long
if you're livin idol, the t'cha, that's my title
Shakin it up, wakin it up, makin it up, breakin it up
Takin it up higher, no liar, you can't deny the
Public Enemy, with the public enema
I gets way up in your buttocks, I rocks cause it's hip-hop
The long-laster, Chuck D with BlastMurderer
I know you heard of the word I be swervin and servin ya
Alertin ya, while splurtin a divine speech
Slow the party down so I can spit it
To each I teach mystic lyric, don't stop, you can get it
You better hear it.. battle?  Quit it!

[Chuck D]	Unstoppable, Public Enemy on a disc
[KRS-One]	Unstoppable
[Griff]		Runnin the game, Chuck and Kris
[KRS-One]	Unstoppable, bet you didn't know they had grip
[together]	Unstoppable
[Chuck D]	You don't wanna take this risk
[Chuck D]	Unstoppable, Public Enemy on a disc
[together]	Unstoppable
[KRS-One]	You don't wanna take the risk!

[Chuck D]
Can the black hear his stepchild, run the mile
Forever like a juvenile, to stay alive
Survivin in the freestyle, yo hold it down
Walkin on the wild side, to live or die
Damn another slow song
Yo Money put the recrod back the FUCK on
No respect for the Usual Suspects, mad teens
pourin fire on the gasoline, defeat fiends
Feelin like fever, I'm gettin warm
Chalk marks in the rainstorm, children of the gone
lost and forgotten, minds rotten
The arcade shot em, Channel Zero on the TV got em
If you don't love yourself you can't love nobody
If you don't know yourself, then you nobody
Do your thing, no bang, in the same damn gang
I never sang, I'm back, but I transmit slang
Silence in the face of violent crews
My rhymes and news be blacker than most blues
Troublein, it all come tumblein, for the strugglin
occupations, daily operations stimulations
causin mental violations, minds on vacation
In the middle of Revelation is a nation
