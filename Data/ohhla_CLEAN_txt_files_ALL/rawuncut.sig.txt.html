What
Spit what man
Man I don't know where that shit be comin from dawg for real
Ain't no fuckin rapper man
16
I don't know jay
If you don't believe me then

[Beanie]
Who you know who can spit till he pop the real
Never thought about rappin till he coped his deal
I really held down my block for real
All I do is crack rock and how to pop the steel
How to box niggas in where they can barely move
Roll wit straight thugs never scary dudes
Keep bodies on them guns and we share our tools
Duece 1 ball for philly like Larry Hughes
Keep the desert eagle wit the beam tucked by the scrotum
Get locked in jail run a block sell open
Mind went to jail I get dro el's roll em
Rookie nigga clippin niggas like L odom
I got dough I choose not to spend it
Catch me in avis &amp;budget in somethin rented
Long as the windows tented (I don't give a fuck)
I'm in it 
I was holdin wit music rollin in the gold infinit

(chorus)  

[Jay-Z]
We keep it raw &amp; uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it 
It might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thats how life goes
But nigga this is the life you chose ya heard me

[Beanie]
We keep it raw &amp; uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it
It might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thas how life goes
Thas just the life we chose

[Jay-Z]
We don't complain thas just how it be
I shuffle back against the ropes like ali
I hustle through the alley through the valley of the death
And I never play fair in the eyes of the ref
Fuck it give me a tech and i'll come back right
Can't go inside the game ain't got enough strikes
Come at me wrong i'll come at you the same
Come at me sideways i'll come blastin your brains
Come at me direct and i'll come back wit names
I'm hot like boilin water I'll come back wit cane

(Chorus)

[Jay-Z]
Keep it raw &amp; uncut for all the bitches and hoes
The first time you sniff it 
It might hurt your nose

[Beanie]
But only the strong survive and thas how life goes
I know I'm outta control
Me and jay same track you gotta be kiddin
Its like that nigga Jordan i'm Scottie Pippen
Its like Magic Worthy
Parish Bird an
Stockten Malone shit
Who gonna stop and hold this
Game like Doc and Moses
Full court press and the rock control this

Chorus

[Beanie]
We keep it raw &amp; uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it
It might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thas how life goes
Thas just the life we chose

[Jay-Z]
We keep it raw &amp; uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it 
It might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thats how life goes
But nigga this is the life you chose ya heard me

[Beanie]
I use to catch that train and snatch that chain
Do anything for a game to catch some change
Whether it was shootin the dice or clappin the gauge
I was a nigga wit a strong arm like satchel paige
I'm tellin you dawg I'm the wrong one to fuck wit at all
I'm the type that'll set a broad day in the mall
Up in glocks wit body shops takin a fall
Fuck you cock swats feds and all

[Jay-Z]
No no no homie I didn't say I could hit you wit dirty o's
But I said if I can supply 30 of those
ding ding homie come holla at the kingpin
The gods are reapal the carters is leathel
Hang wit psychotic people who like so fuck niggas
Came up singin that god was evils
Slang Heron to cats is like revolvin a eagle
And I blew to the point I bought cars for the people

[Jay-Z]
We keep it raw &amp; uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it 
It might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thats how life goes
But nigga this is the life you chose ya heard me

[Beanie]
We keep it raw &amp; uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it
It might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thas how life goes
Thas just the life we chose
