It's the city of jackers, swindlers, pimps and hoes,
and niggas that bang and slang in kilo's.
Where the rule is 'fool we don't play that'
Bomb to your mutherfucking lip, watch it get fat.
4 deep in a car on a mission.
Load up the glock and watch it start spittin'.
Nobody understands the gang mentality.
I don't give a fuck, just want to see some casualties.
And we'll beat your ass down with the quickness.
Busters know that they can't get with this.
Put the sweat down on a fool at the bus stop.
Wrong set, wrong move get smoothe popped.
Gots to make our money on the corner.
Try to sqeeze, nigga please, a straight gonner.
Survival of the fittest with a gun or a knife.
Geah, cause its Compton 4 Life.

One more 'Drive-by Miss Daisy', 
Its for the hood and nigga, we straight crazy.
Fools can't cope when we belling.
Throw up your hood cause its Compton we yelling.
Still selling that yayo, oh know.
Watch out for the tape thats made by 5-0.
Look into the eyes of the 12 guage barrel.
My t-shirt and khaki's with house shoes is the apparel.
Just call me a nigga with a problem.
Better yet a trouble shooter cause I'm a shoot the enemy
when I see the white of his eyes.
You'll have a funeral every night cause on of your homies dies.
Geah, It don't mean nothing to us. Ready to buss
A thousand mutherfuckers and we kick up much dust.
Another dead, chalk up one for the hood tonight.
Geah right, nigga, cause its Compton 4 Life.

Its the city where everybodies in prison.
Niggas keep taking shit, cause aint nobody given.
So another punk fool I must beat.
Learned the tricks of the trade from the street.
Anxious to put the jack down. Ready and willing.
One more Compton driveby killing.
One more nigga that got jacked cause he's a dummy.
One more fool that got smoked for the money.
And we got evil ass bitches, just like witches.
Got to keep the hoes because they set up snitches.
Niggas run off at the mouth here goes the nine.
Peel your cap if you wanna drop the dime.
Go to jail, hell might as well. Be off with the
head so I bail from the police officer.
Cause if I surrender from the fight.
It won't be no more Compton 4 Life. Geah!</pre>
