[Krayzie Bone]
Take me
Higher, higher, baby
Can you feel it?? (feel it, feel it, feel it)
Do you feel the same weed high that I feel??
Cuz I'm so high (reefer makes you feel that way)
And I feeling so right
Roll (roll), let's smoke, I got to get high
I been high since the last song (off that la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
And i just been smokin' and smokin'
Smoke another blunt, roll another up
You know that weed can really ease your mind
Every time I smoke good reefer that indo high makes me fly
If everyboby smoked a blunt, relieve the mind, the world could
be a better place
If everybody took a break and we all just got wasted
Toked out (out, out out), smoked out (out, out, out), 
choked out (out, out, out), pull another O (out, out, out)
Let's get P-O-D-ded (P-O-D-ded, P-O-D-ded)

[Chorus]
[Bizzy Bone]
The weed can't get no better (no better baby)

[Bizzy Bone]
20 dollar hollars, all day, everyday
Come around my way, you gone want to stay
Weed makes me hungry, happy, and all I can say
Sure I need some more
Don't make we wait, stay awake, fake sleep,
got the weed between the sheets
Catch me, Mary J. blessed me
Open up the dime, stimulate your mind, slide my thumb up the blunt
Open up and what you'll find in there (you don't really want)
I never been in High Times (I never been in High Yimes)
I never been in High Times 
but can you tell me that I've been so high all my life
Am I high enough (am I high enough)
Am I high enough (am I high enough)

[Wish Bone]
I remeber being a little thug
Weed, really didn't know what it was
Then I took a puff and I realized
I should always, stay high
The weed (the weed), makes me feel alright (alright)
If you feel like i feel, I got half on yo dime
If you got weed smoke it, I'm a real weed smoker
If it's mine then I would
since its yours you could, you should
If I ain't there when you blaze a blunt nigga huh, please think of me
Cuz you know I nigga like to get high (high), high and free
Smokin' all night, feelin' all right
Bone Thugs get high, so high
High, high, all night, high, high
So high

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my my my my
I know you wonder why I do it. Love the sky
And I soar up so high
This mornin' I was in my bed
Bangin' and ringin' inside my head
I wanted to make love to you baby, but last night I got P-O-Ded instead
So please don't go away, that's all I got to say
Is I gotta have you mary j
Such a heavenly feelin' I get when i'm taking fat ass blunts to the brain
Oh darlin' I'm goin insane, and I really wish we can
Kick it at home in America, like it was on in amsterdam
You heard enough, you heard it all, nothin' but a, a really thug nigga
Nothin' less than a killa, I'm out in front makin' my scrilla
I'm happy to know , the slide is the ball, and kick as strong as me
You rippin' the bone like me, can get it as long as me

[Layzie Bone]
And when I need to free my mind
I can find, satisfaction in a bag of weed
Everything I need, leave it to the trees
It can make me feel better, and every day I wake
Niggas rollin' up blunts, and mo blunts, and mo blunts
And I keep a case of Swisher Sweets in the trunk
So when I'm rollin', smokin', chokin', just floatin'
Through the city in my drop top
Glock cocked, rollin', just rollin'
Me and mary jane
Its my world, its my thang
The way she penetrates my brain
Buddah, done blessed me with game
Good game, you wanna chop it up,
we can kick it, smoke a fatty to the dome
Nigga lay high, thugged out, smokin', all, night, long
