*the first three notes of Taps plays*

[guard] C'mon c'mon this shit's over with.
*commotion breaks out*
[girl]  I'm not done talking to him!
[guard] C'mon boy, back to your cell.
        Shut that shit up bitch! He's outta here, c'mon.
[guy]   Don't be callin my woman no bitch!  I'll fuck you up!
[guard] Yeah yeah fool, what?  Yeah yeah that's what they all say fool.
        You institutionalized, and this is your home...

Guess who's back, and ready to knock off a cop or two
Cause me and the crew could still get our rocks off
The penetentiary don't stop a nigga cause he's in jail
Hell I'm makin more money on the street from here in a cell
I'm livin proper, the coppers is havin fits
I just made the profit, you punks ain't stoppin shit
I still remember my momma told me
Find the cop who killed your brother
send him to Hell lookin homely
Cause a real nigga love the law
What's raw is a nigga that's above the law
Keep pressin your luck and get fucked, huh
Think a nigga don't know whassup cause he's locked up
But in the meantime, it's get swoll get clean time
Concentrate on gettin green time
And as the years go by, they forgot
about the small time soldier from the block, huh
To kill the crook they threw the book at me
Don't worry be nappy, don't even look happy
Put me in the hole, gave me cold cuts
Did push-ups until I swoll up
And then they offer me a furlough
But what they don't know as soon as I get free I'm killin five mo'
They asked me if I changed much
I told em 'Yeah' even though I'm still the same nut
They started askin my questions about my brother
And makin remarks about my mother, hmm
Wait a minute, hold up
Makin jokes about my folks'll get yours blown up
They sent me back to the hole for what I told em
I guess he didn't believe me, so I showed him
He went home to find a tragedy
Nigga, that's what you get for tryin to badger me
And anybody else that wanna sweat me
I'm already in jail so you punks can't get me
You better pray they never see me
Cause if they let me free, prepare for trouble on the streets.
When I get free

Chorus: When I get free (3X)
