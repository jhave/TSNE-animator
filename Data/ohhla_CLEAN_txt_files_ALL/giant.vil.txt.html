The Moment of truth, from the flow in the booth
Is it a classic to blow through the roof
Just ask 'n let me show you the proof
We stronger than ever along with the pressure
Longer then lesser, we bonded together
Like a song belongs with a measure
We pawnded ya treasure, a thing I wont do for the chips
And this be speaking from my heart, so I ain't using my lips
Like a ventriloquist, and as I stand killing this
While this rain, critics wont admit, how I can and still exist
Its a introduction, discussin the info
stuck in my mental window, thats meant to function
Let the people be the judge
We know and expect it, you holdin the record
Way before the needle even budge
The most hated on, and I stayed alone, was rated wrong
And its a headache, like yankin domes with a straightening comb
When our bread brake, articles of artists who aren't as hard yo'
Partners by fathers, regardless they are a star you know
Soon as it politics, with dollars become a prince
Be honest, if not I promise, I'ma just switch the style of it
With possibly what the game needs, with the same greed
You fakers is with,making a hit like when you playin we...indeed

[Chorus 2X  -  Elzhi + T3]
We areeeeeeeee
V- Villa, V-Villa

They say a nigga fell off when my nigga [Dilla] exited
3 albums later I kill 'em gotta represent
2 albums back [Baatin] had left
Kinda threw me off balance, put a limp in my step
But I pray for my nigga you know its one love
But let me tell you some shit thats kinda fucked up
Besides the 'Tin thing, we wasn't the in-thing
With the bling bling like mista ching a ling
So we didn't get a second single, or a video
So I say fuck 'em get the dick like a pretty ho
I guess we didn't need 'em, thanks for the freedom
And every time we see 'em, we let the finger greet 'em

[Chorus 'til fade]</pre>
