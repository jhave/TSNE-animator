You know there's one single to root right? Hebrews 12:15 check it out
You know there's a few things in my life that cause me to be bitter and, I'm just asking God, I'm like

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter... so take it all away

Anybody know the feeling of rejection?
Feels like you was kicked in your midsection
When you feel like you simply just lost your best friend
Everybody play the game of love, you ride the bench and
You start thinking she's chilling with other men, and you getting jealous, start beefing, and harboring harsh resentment
I'm asking Jesus to keep me from being bitter, go skeeming on twitter, get mad and post it on my statuses
Bitterness can make a heart numb
But hope is like a star you don't see it shine bright until the dark come
So don't just scoop the dust, remove the rug
If I got unforgiveness in my heart, then there really ain't no room for love
Plus it's stupid cause, I've been so forgiven
That if I hold a grudge, I don't show He's risen
But I know my sins removed since Jesus came
With no reason to forgive me but He did so I do the same

Ugh

Sometimes things just happen in life that don't make any sense, but, bitterness is a choice

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter... so take it all away

Yea, I gotta tread softly
Don't wanna be a hypocrite plus I got some bitterness I wanna get up off me
Where should I start, well I feel like I'd be sorta frontin'
To say that when my father calls that I don't hit ignore button
It's probably cause we never kicked it at a younger age
I know when he's calling but I don't have got his number saved
I keep dodging him but I'm just being honest
All he wanna do is talk football and how I should play in college
I get bitter, kinda cold like the winter
It's so hard for me to forgive him then I remember that I'm a sinner
And Jesus forgave me and washed away my sins
When I didn't deserve it then I could forgive him
His power in such amazing love like when Jesus forgave the ones that pinned him up on that cross as he was hanging from it
Holy Spirit, teach me to be just like the Son
Remove the roots of bitterness don't stop until your work is done

God I don't wanna be bitter, teach me to forgive, let me see my own sin

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter... so take it all away

Bitter, bitter, bitter

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter... so take it all away

Bitter, bitter, bitter

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter... so take it all away</pre>
