[Verse 1]
All right stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back I got a brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop? Yo - I don't know
Now turn off the lights (huh) and I'll glow
And to the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

[Chorus 5x]
Too cold, Too cold

[Repeat until next verse]
But you be talkin' that shit

[Verse 2]
Dance, bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, now as I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gain way
You better hit the bull's eye, the kid don't play
And if there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby!, Ice ice baby!
Ice ice baby!, Ice ice baby!

[Verse 3]
Take heed, Cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, That created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
Cause my style is like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and know you wanna step with this
Swamp plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast, other DJ's say "damn"
If a rhyme was a drug, you know i'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic and when I kick my juice
And if there was a problem, you know that I would solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Chorus]
Ice ice baby
(throw your hands in the air, let me know you're out there)
Ice ice baby, ice ice baby
(throw your hands in the air, let me know you're out there)
Ice ice baby, too fuckin' cold
Too cold, too cold, too cold, too cold
Ice ice baby
Too cold, too cold
Ice ice baby
Too cold, too cold
Ice ice baby
Too cold, too cold
Ice ice baby
Too cold, too cold</pre>
