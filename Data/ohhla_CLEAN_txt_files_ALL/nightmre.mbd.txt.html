Yea.. Amerikaz Motherfuckin Nightmare bitch

[Havoc]
They wanna know, where the hood at, nigga we right here
Live in the flesh with the Tec's they never scared
Them guns we holdin, claustrophobic, we'll let 'em in
Dump Dump, reloaded the Amerikaz Nightmare
They wanna know, where the hood at, nigga we right here
Live in the flesh with the Tec's they never scared
Them guns we holdin, claustrophobic, we'll let 'em in
Dump Dump, reloaded the Amerikaz Nightmare

[Havoc]
Dogs, I think smarter, reach harder
slugs travel much farther
Niggaz stomped a Timberland wearing face carver
With the box cutter, top gutter
I hover over you lames, Run for cover, end in your brain (yea)
You did your thang but not very good
And by the looks of things, You can't come back to the hood
This is not a good look for you my nigga
Wus really poppin, Inquirin minds wanna know
How you rocking them new guns, we cope those
Invoke, like we bought 'em in Costco's
Don't get yaself murk'd, wet shirt
Said it first, hurry this that red alert
You ain't gotta get buck to know that this letter hurt
The sight of my Hammer, gotcha heart pumping
Nerves twitching, Eyes jumping, heads will roll
when the pound starts kicking You be missing
Moms will be wearing that yellow ribbon
While I'm somewhere in the Carribean Islands, chillin

[Chorus]
They wanna know, where the hood at, nigga we right here
Locking the flesh with the Tec's they never scared
Them guns we holdin', claustrophobic, we'll let 'em in
Dump Dump, reloaded the Amerikaz Nightmare

[Prodigy]
YeaDun..You know we keep them big thangs ( big thangs )
That make dead people when we hit brains (hit brains)
It's a wrap for the sequel get yo whip spray'd (whip sprayed )
Tho I rather hit you walkin, get yo shit shaved ( shit shaved )
Plus showered up, talkin then we split, EY (woo wooo)
Wont catch me gun smokin, have the cops think
There was drugs that provoke it while we rollin, EY
Baby girl, I see you, can I get a taste
Of that thang, heard its lethal in a good way
Just so you kno I ain't the one that get yo clit ate
But hope you got a strong back, I'll make yo shit break
You'll be walking like a penguin for a few days
Yo Bitch, you know we got BIG CASH
Money fallin out our pockets, give you whiplash
When we drive past your project, ain't nobody can stop us
Infamous they can't stop us, They want our spot
Yo fall bak nigga we got this

[Chorus ]

[Prodigy]
I got love for my niggaz, love for my niggaz
Love for my niggaz, got love for my niggaz
I bust thugs for my niggaz, thug for my niggaz
Thugs for my niggaz, bust bloods for my niggaz

[Havoc]
Yo slugs touchin, medics will rush you
Jay dusting for Prince, make shift
Morgues made for you pricks
You know wuts on my hips, you know the hood that I rep
You know we dumpin' them clips
You in the valley of death

[Prodigy]
Get comfortable nigga, you runnin out of breath (outta breath)
Ya blood is spilling thru the sealing of the necks (of the necks)
Floor or have you flood the cement
Ouside somewhere on the streets, no longer in the flesh

[Chorus]</pre>
