Aiyyo P man, it's that shit!
That real shit!  That's comin back around
And we've been on it.. for a long time now!
You know who started this shit
So you know who gon' finish it..

Yo, I don't give a fuck who lookin or starin at me
Get your gulliest nigga, fuck it and send him at me
I got the recipe to make paper, they wanna clap me
Misery love company and they see we happy
They even dap me but I see right through the bullshit
Word to the tally hope my hammer clap, more than a lil' bit
You fuckin with lil' bitches I'm fuckin with grown women
And fuck if they golddiggin, as long as I'm hittin
they gets nathan, afraid not for penetration
A little tongue and some cock, they say I'm nasty
But I only freak with my main shorty
Thought she had me handled cause she tattooed my name
I see you niggaz schemin my niggaz I see you comin
You lookin at a nigga whose stomach is used to touchin
What's really good with you homey, you think you know me
That's a problem, they say at the top, it get lonely
I clap the chromey, you niggaz beter step lively
They say life's a bitch, but don't remind me

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Fuck waitin for you to make a move - clap first
I gotta do it my nigga win or lose - clap first
When these slugs hit you 'member they was meant for you - clap first
Ain't nobody on this earth invincible - clap first

[Prodigy]
Yea yea yea yea, aiyyo
I pledge allegiance to our flag, may no man put asunder
Gun in my pants, make my shit sag
Tougher(?) letters on my hand, spells what I stand for
Flip on you and your mans, for speakin on my thugs
Hop out the trenches on niggaz, they runnin from us
P hoppin fences and benches, avoidin them slugs
Real slow when they back out, you cockin shit back
I got one in the head and I'm turnin ya hats
Then I spit what I want you to know with these raps
Albums sellin like drugs, we gettin it back
Bodies wrapped in Versace quilts, home invasions
Bitch-ass niggaz is found in the basements
Smoke with the family, and spill drinks for our dead
Drive in the backseat, fucked up your lady head
Rolled back up the window, and then we slid
As I roll what's left of this, triangle bag man

(See, that's what the fuck I'm talkin bout)
(Niggaz can't FUCK with us!)
