Muscle Cars- yeeeeY'!..

[Chorus]

[E-40]
Not out of the local news paper, but out the AutoTrader
Cleaner, than virgin cuchie, my nigg', one on her Cutlass, playa'
The beat wrapped in monster cables, the speakers thump'n
Trunk sound'n like Godzilla, and King Kong, back there thump'n
All we do is wic, and get high and petal and push!
Organic weed, mysterey weed, just purple cush!
I cut the the rear weld, on my whip, and filled that bitch up
and now muscle car sit'n up high like a monster truck
Monster up', suck up to none, don't be no poodle
Split his pack open like pack of Top Ramen noodle
In the heart of the soil, where you can find me
Try me fuck boi', and get your face put on a white tee
40, Turf Talk and Keak the Sneak
They maynee' ass voices, and they styles is hekka unique
High speed chase's and run'n lights
Water in the duals, make loud glass pipes

[Chorus]

[Keak Da Sneak]
Thumper, and carburator. four speed Trany
Dual exahust dipped in sauce
My car is a beast, catch me in the streets side ways
Threw the East Side-Boi', crunk like Lil' Jon
Show 40, and Mac Keak the last don
East Okaland the land of the side show
Richmond, Frisco, to the Valley Jo'
I'm ridin side ways, this way and that way
Doors open, while in traffic
Hold the door open, (Hello!)
Shit'n on em', no front'n
455 got me run'n up on Aston Martins
We run from dem on streets, not the freeway
B&amp;M shift kit (kirrrk) me and Danny Phea
On my celly cell stright lace with no fuck'n dew
Mobb'n in my Ol' skool, like Lil' Bruce'

[Chorus]

[Turf Talk]
Four 15's, beat supreme
Told niggaz fuck Rally's, ride gold one's mayne'
Mother's off candid, don't hate cause I ain't me
Race, foo, smoke in yo' face, foo'
Super charger, push this botton and my engine start up
Pistol tucked
Might be pirmiered, but my engine souped up
Quick to the floor, when you open yours
Don't scratch my doors. 350' I push heavy
Not a Ford it's (Chevy), (Chevy), (Chevy)
First owner, not too many miles on her
We rep the BAY, we don't rep Califronia, (I'm lie'n...)
I'm run you for your car note
Why you don't got SS's in front of your Monte Carlo?
Residence full of white folks
I'm leave fresh tire marks top of they asphalt

[Bridge]
You got muscle car? You fuck'n wit' dem Muscle cars?
