[Verse One: Oobie]
I'm sittin knee on top of you
Doin' things that lovers do
But I don't belong to you
What's a girl suppose to do?
You give me one night with you
To make all our dreams come true
You could never be my man
You can be my one night stand

[Chorus]
Boy I know you've gotta a girl
And you know I've gotta man
So lets's both respect the game
And have a one night stand

Everybody wanna know
But they wouldn't understand
So let's keep it on the low
And have a one night stand

[Verse two: Oobie]
Well it's about a quarter to three
And no one's lookin it's just you and me
You know I'm down for whateva and I aim to please
But it's only for this one night

Boy I hope that you'll come well prepared
Cause I want you to know that I ain't ever scared
You just wanna fuck R.S.V.P and I'll be there
But it's only for this one night

[Chorus]

[Verse three: Lil Jon]
Shawty let me know what's up wit it
Won't you let a real thug hit it
Stop playin' with these lames ain't got not shame the liquor is the blame
I just gotta tell you this
Those lips I wanna kiss
That ass I gotta grab
Yo shit I gotta stab
I've got my baby momma
You've got yo baby daddy
We ain't got all night lil momma get it right yo shit is good and tight
I' ain't bout' them games shawty
You know my name shawty

Just use yo brains if you know what I'm sayin'
This one night stand shawty

[Chorus]

{Bridge One}
If you know how to keep a secret
You can get it fa' sho'
Just make sure you get enough
Cause you can't get it no more

If you know how to keep a secret
You can get it fa' sho'
Just make sure you get enough
Cause you can't get it no more

[Verse Four: Big Sam]
Come and ride out wit' cha' boy
Big Sam big filled with Almond Joy
Like I told you I'm somethin like a freak
So keep the games for the middle of the week
Girl you look so pretty
Wit' cho' big ol' ass and yo tengo bitties
Red bone 5'7, 5'9
For one night I gotta make you mine
And I know you gotta man shawty
And you know I gotta wife shawty
So let's strap it up I hope the pussy's tight
Cause I got one night shawty

{Bridge two}
I'm not tryna' be yo girlfriend
Let's have a one night stand

And you can never be my boyfriend
Let's have a one night stand

[Chorus]

{Bridge three}
Can you be my man?
(Only for one night)
And I'll be yo girl
(Only for one night)
If you be my man
(Only for one night)
Then I'll be yo girl only for one night</pre>
