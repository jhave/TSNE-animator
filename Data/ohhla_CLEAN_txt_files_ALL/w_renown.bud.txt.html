[Crave] (Juice)
A and B C, I squeeze the D.E.
I'm a F'ing G, niggas H on I
(J, I'm 718, deep in the grind
Four five six keeping the nine, stay on my tools)
In school I was dip and I was fly
65 was the grade and it was getting me by
(Kick in cafeteria tables, Harachi kicks flicking the sable
Sick with the lines, I'm a bad man)
I earn figures, learnt, never burn bridges
Get my cock licked, by these bird bitches
(I conserve figures, feeling cake on real estate
Donnie Bake elite, we burn niggas)
I'm advanced in the mind, I'm so deep it's like
I'm felt by the hands of the blind
(So let's see, let's see if my gun is empty
Test me, impress me, you best respect me)

[Chorus: Buddha Monk]
Bitch I, won't stop, rocking the rhythm
Cuz, um, we get down, cuz, um, we get down
Cuz, um, we get down, cuz, um, we get down
Cuz, um, we get down, do you really wanna get down?

[Floorless] (Mello)
Yo, if I ain't hustling, I'm probably cutting up work in my ride
Cuz I can't see working with a button up shirt and tie
(I'd rather be my own boss, cuz nowadays
It ain't nothing that I can name free, even loans cost)
I'm trynna bone whores that hop in they own fours
And when it's war, they own guns pop and they own pause
(It's only right, me and my homey's tight
We run trains on your wife on a lonely night)
I clap 'em with his bird kids (then I ask 'em where his birds is)
If he don't confess, I dump 'em from the Willis Burg's Bridge
(Mello pose where the curb is, on the realest block
Son stay on the vacant strip where the nerds is)
You don't want feel pellets racing where ya nerves is
(Your name should be perfect example of what a herb is)
He don't want it with the O's (niggas'll beat him down and kick 'em out)
He like damn, all I wanted was a O</pre>
