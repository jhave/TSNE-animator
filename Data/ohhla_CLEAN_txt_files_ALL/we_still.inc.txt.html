[Ronnie Bumps]
Alright...get your motherfuckin guns up (Throw them guns up)
Fuck that (And my motherfuckin two)
This is hows it going down this is how it's goin motherfuckin big
We still don't give a fuck (You know)
For life (You know) For death (You know)

A knife will your frame or (I gotta gun)
What the fuck you think the things for (shed blood)
Man I keep it gang when I it's time to give it
Understand we run bank who colidin wit us?
I'm knee deep in the game, plannin the block in the rain
Tell your mom dog ain't shit gon change
The world don't trust us, one whore gutters
POV City hustlas, Ya gun motherfuckers

[D.O.]
Hit the gun away bumps man I got these niggaz
Tell Caddillac to chill I'm about to rock these niggaz
Got your game sharp man cuz you watchin niggaz
Now I'm back on top, can't stop me niggaz
It's hard like life, man dog I'm holdin the dice
I'm ain't trying to poke your wife, man I'm gunnin for ice
When you see me on the streets pray for your life
It's murder motherfucker now your payin the price

[Merc]
Yo, yo, yo
Get it right cuz we ain't the type for all the bullshit
Nigga front give him the full clip
I back down your whole strip,  Let off six
Get low re-load quick Stand up and fire again
Never test Merc You could be a foe or a friend
We don't give a fuck if it ain't murder you can get it
Ya nigga young, doorag under the finit
And I'm labeled as a problem for all y'all niggaz

[Jody Mack]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Who y'all know who to come to when twenty three shoe slow
The gangsta Mack I kill dudes fo-sho
I ain't the game nigga, I be poppin them thangs
At anyone of y'all niggaz who think we locked in this game
Ya motherfuckers must be ready to die
Fuckin wit the murderous I
Knowin that the murder was right
(So la la la) who wanna get at me nigga
(Who am I?) Ten Mack I clap you nigga

[Rah]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It was bad enough that I live a thug life, shit
I had ta crush it up and throw it in bags and pitch
Night in and night out, now I'm a clear it out
When I spit outta my mouth, niggaz know what I'm about
It's no lookin back, tryin to get out of time to stack
Workin and puttin it in and waitin to get it back
Bloods thick and when money comes that's real phat
In tens and thin and a bitch then look at that

[0-1]
Who am I, 0-1 livin the time
Befo the time I be pushin the five
So ya niggaz better (Get it riiiight)
Or get it real fucked up
20 or some odd shots flyin threw your truck
What the deal, wanna know how I feel right now?
Ready to kill motherfuckers and lay niggaz down
Fuckin wit niggaz that's clown, fuckin wit niggaz that's wild
Be lost, can't be found
Be found somewhere drowned, motherfuckers

[Charli Baltimore]
Knock knock who is it?
The fuckin esquisit
Chuck spit for my bitches on federal visits
With the weed that cop smugglin
Baby daddies are not jugglin
Cases, time faces
Twenty five bitch ride and bitch lie
Cuz real chicks do their bid to wit kids to
And that's murda for real
Bitch thug me, hood niggaz lovin me
Gangsta ass touchin me, Chuck

[Caddillac Tah]
Yo, yo
Whenever 'llac hotwire the 'lac
Niggaz better get the fire and get the runnin
When the fifth spit gunnin, I'm leavin em numb and shit
Now he can't feel his legs, fifteen minutes away from death
Let us pray
I've been cut, remied up
In the box, the porshe
On the eighteen they ain't thugs but I keep em clean
And dope fiends, off the nine and a half board off they leanin
Whoever think shit don't stink I leave em stinkin
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder

[Black Child]
What, yeah, yeah, nigga
And we don't bang and ball
We burry the bubble and buy another one tommorow
Die motherfucker a head full of hollo's
Close your casket, them basterd in those apollo's
Wanna lock us up, stop our rush
Pop the clutch, split a nigga back like a dutch
That's what's up
Nigga, we still don't give a fuck {*echoes out*}</pre>
