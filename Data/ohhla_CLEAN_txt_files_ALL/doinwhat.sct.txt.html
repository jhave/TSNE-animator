Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Pre-Hook]
Titanic wrist, I got water diamonds
Gigantic money, all my money pilin
BMG numbers got that hood shinin
New Mexico City, yea we over grindin

[Chorus]
I'm just doin what I wanna do
Doin what I wanna do, doin what I wanna do
I'm just doin what I wanna do
Doin what I wanna do, doin what I wanna do

[Verse 1]
Walkin in the club and you know K Blacka blowin free
Niggas right beside me now and they got a scrapper too
Stick a nigga up, man I guess that's what you wanna do
But you better not try on me cause these niggas cock and shoot
Doin what I wanna do, I walk when that scrap pop
Trap out of cemetery, call that bitch a body ho
Doin what I wanna do, key niggas round me ball shit
They do what I say, if I say it then you all acquitted
Snitchin on a nigga, man I don't  that ain't what I do
Don't put that in my lifestyle
Man that shit'll cost you
Ridin in a hoopty backseat for the top a toy
Doin what I wanna do, I'd do it for them cowboys

[Pre-Hook]
Titanic wrist, I got water diamonds
Gigantic money, all my money pilin
BMG numbers got that hood shinin
New Mexico City, yea we over grindin

[Chorus]
I'm just doin what I wanna do
Doin what I wanna do, doin what I wanna do
I'm just doin what I wanna do
Doin what I wanna do, doin what I wanna do

[Verse 2]
Bitch I'm Young Scooter, do what the fuck I wanna do
Me and Bambino go in the gutta pullin moves
You know I got them water diamonds worth a lot of free bands
Fact you sell me 100 thousand, yea I get them racks in
Fuck out the truck, yea Scooter getting them packs in
You run out of money, I could front you a package
You ever seen 20 birds? I could make that happen
Got gigantic money, shit taller than a mansion
Put yo hands in the air if you got brickfair
Put yo hand in yo pocket, throw some free bands
Every day I wake up another pack land
That lean got me leaning like a kickstand

[Pre-Hook]
Titanic wrist, I got water diamonds
Gigantic money, all my money pilin
BMG numbers got that hood shinin
New Mexico City, yea we over grindin

[Chorus]
I'm just doin what I wanna do
Doin what I wanna do, doin what I wanna do
I'm just doin what I wanna do
Doin what I wanna do, doin what I wanna do</pre>
