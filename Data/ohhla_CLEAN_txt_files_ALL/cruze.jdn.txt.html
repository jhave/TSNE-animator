Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's the lucridis stupid kids bout to raise the roof again
They let us in the booth again
It's distained socks and dry crocks
Get out of the clique if you're not hot cause I got that cootie illness
Tell me if you feel this
Even though we'll soon know we the realest
Cause we run this
See me up in Cali, see me up in London
A penny bought and I'm skating in style cause I'm still rocking my Jordans (duh)
Louie V, we can't afford it
But I'm still rocking MSFTS cause all of that stuff is boring
I rep MSFTS to the death of me
J what's to my right of me
Isaac to the left of me
All these rules, sorry they ain't getting me
I'm a skate forever and these jokers never bother me

I just wanna cruze with my dudes
We ain't got nothing to lose
Breaking all the rules
Talk about the news
Talk about the cliques and the crews
Messing up our shoes and we kick flips

I just wanna cruze with my dudes
We ain't got nothing to lose
Breaking all the rules
Talk about the news
Talk about the cliques and the crews
Messing up our shoes and we kick flips

I don't care about the rules
Barely in school and the chef isn't cool
But I ain't got a problem in the world
Cause I got my top down and I'm ridin with my girl and
Now that uh... I'm just living life
I am not a true
I'm just tryin to live cool
We the freshest
Dip up in the pool cause it's cool and refreshin
Shouts getters to my freshmans
And my flow is hotter than the clothes that you dressed in
Girl I'm chillin with my best friends
We could call yours, we could knock up on some doors
Take you to some stores, talk about all of our tours
And we chillin for the night so ladies we all yours
We just livin to the fullest
But soon as we go broke you be dodging us like bullets

So I just wanna cruze with my dudes
We ain't got nothing to lose
Breaking all the rules
Talk about the news
Talk about the cliques and the crews
Messing up our shoes and we kick flips

I just wanna cruze with my dudes
We ain't got nothing to lose
Breaking all the rules
Talk about the news
Talk about the cliques and the crews
Messing up our shoes and we kick flips

Let the track breathe for a second
Got some nice bars, you should check em
MSFTS life if you with it
But if you're not then just forget it
My windows stay tinted
Dippin from the paparazzi
You don't understand if you're not me
They got me
Jockin from the photos
You already know though
Well little joker keep it on the low low
So stay out of our business
Or tag along is you with this
Cause I could spit this
And you should chill cause you're messin with the MSFTS

I just wanna cruze with my dudes
We ain't got nothing to lose
Breaking all the rules
Talk about the news
Talk about the cliques and the crews
Messing up our shoes and we kick flips

I just wanna cruze with my dudes
We ain't got nothing to lose
Breaking all the rules
Talk about the news
Talk about the cliques and the crews
Messing up our shoes and we kick flips</pre>
