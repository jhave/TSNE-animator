[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Who got that ya-yo off the boarder
We got that, yeah

We rock that, huh
And all black with 23's on 'em

Who got that ya-yo off the boarder
We got that, yeah
Who shut cha' down in New Orleans
Nigga we got that, huh
Them white tee's and them b's on 'em
We rock that, huh
And all black with 23's on 'em
Nigga we rock that, yeah

[Baby]
I got my prada joggin' suit with my B's on
We alligator the seats with white tee's on
I'm in my Escalade niggaz tryin' na' get paid
I got 'em for 10 5 we do this like erryday
I hit the mall tear it down with my bitch nigga
And let her spend money like it ain't shit nigga
I hustle 10 ways we do this like erryday
we stay up on the grind nigga know we got ta get paid
I hit the club V.I.P reppin' uptown
We poppin' bottles in this bitch that how we put it down
And every bitch in the club wanna be down
they know how a real nigga do it and wanna get down
So where ya' at, where ya' at throw ya' sets up
We stay fly in the hood when we coming up
I got the baddest bitch go head and check the list
You mighta' seen her on T.V. so how you love this (yeah)

[Chorus]

[6 Shot]
Different day nigga same ole' shit
Ten years I been fuckin' with it, huh, Fuckin' with it
Catch me ridin' in the bucket with it
I rather be caught with it than without it
Cause New Orleans niggaz is bout it (no doupt about it)
You can get it sold for solid
Keep my Impala 20 inches polished (styleish)
Gotta ------------------------------ when she want it
Gotta Ostrich (snake) Loabster (steak)
Watch I (take) a half and flip it to a whole and
Keep it white tee Girbauds
Keep the neck froze
With the ear lobe and the pinky
In the super sprot smokin' on sticky (don't think it's a game)
No baby I ain't playin'
Gotta deep stroke if ya' deep throat-------
------------ get it play by play
Step by step rep nigga day by day Yea

[Chorus]

[Baby]
We rockin' Polo like it 1993
And these nigga actin' like it just hit the streets
We had the Dome bumpin'
We the Place jumpin'
We got this money nigga and that's when we went the stuntin'
We wore those Bally Compitions when we put it down
And every nigga in the hood wore they own crown
And John Law taught a nigga how to duck clowns
Cause evertime came round they laid the mutherfucker down
I saw some niggaz with the ice and then they put it down
But let me tell you homie I ain't gone never out it down
I'm worldwide gettin' money reppin' Uptown
And everytime hit the hood nigga I'ma shut it down
I got the mink with suade on them 26's
I ridin' high in the Benz I'm with some bad bitches
And Weezy F followin' me in a CL nigga
And when you see me you gone always see my lil nigga (Yeah)

[Chorus]</pre>
