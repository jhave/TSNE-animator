Where the fuck you at?

[ VERSE 1: Opio ]
Women are so connivin but they liven me up
Inviting succulent breast bustin through that dress
Impress me and Phes
Hold up, turn around so we can see the rest
Yes! What a dame
A motherfuckin shame
What's your name?
You look fantastic
She responded enthusiastic
Was it the fame? (Nah)
They all the same
What's the difference if it's plastic?
No drastic measures, just for pleasure, laughs, kicks
Conversation was simple, she liked my dimples
Asked me when will I be leavin town, it's goin down
I said tomorrow, a look of sorrow crossed her face
But I'm a ace, skate 'em, shot 'em to the hotel for the satin lace
Treatments, Victoria's Secrets
Get me weak in the knees, baby please don't tease me
She put the squeeze on me, had me whipped
A tight grip, the perfect fit, I flipped
I couldn't handle it, shot 'em out but now I want 'em back
Baby doll, tell me where the fuck you at?

[ VERSE 2: Phesto ]
Yeah, now this shit here sound like some interlude shit
So let me kick some lewdness, slackness
I wish I had a bitch that practiced gymnastics
And when I hit it from the back this
Girl would twirl and twist them fat lips
And make the Johnson vibrate like a tonsil
Plus on the tonsils honey boom be on the job
But if I tried to hang she'd be like a bat out of Hades
Fuck around, get with a nigga, my lady
I want a bitch that's mangy
Maybe glaze me in some cherries and heavy sirup
But never no rain, see, and never no stir-ups
Nah, none of that S&amp;M, just undressin when
It's appropriate and even when it's not
Cause she's hot, so

Where the fuck you at?

[ VERSE 3: A-Plus ]
I knew this nigga that was bigger than life
Pullin the trigger and knives
He'd stick up in ya in fights
And he was the kinda nigga causin pain and static
When you seen him he would make you wanna aim yo 'matic
But that is not happenin, that nigga got backin
Cause if you shot at him 80 niggas will be on yo block cappin
He had family, understand me
And he know po-po, no, he make his dough sellin candy
He got friends in high places
Right in 'em skyscrapers
I bet they help him beat his five cases
Untouched, a true mack indeed
He pull a Mac, you bleed
He made his stack from crack and weed
He fucked up, the fact is
The nigga tried to duck taxes
Now he at that argument you punks static
Federal pen with non-hetero men
Climbin you front to back
Aw, nigga where the fuck you at?

[ VERSE 4: Tajai ]
I like them wide hips to slide in
After the shows we rocked with ease, I'm captivatin
Hoes are waxin and they attractin
I see that lookin at mine's with fascination
Mesmerized so I'm bookin them thighs for a visit later
She replied yes to see her undressed
I just couldn't deny that she possessed the most voluptuous
Ass and D cups, it was almost too much for just me
I said, 'What's up with us?'
We got in the cut and let the lust erupt
Scandalous and she did me justice with them luscious lips
Givin a nigga rushes with the slightest touches, but bust this
Now I gotta live with the repercussions, corruption
She raised up when I dazed under the assumption
She could be trusted, now I'm like what's this
Flustered left for broke I'll cuss this
Hoe I'll probably never see again, had a motive and
Got me for my dough, so all I really wanna know is bitch...

Where the fuck you at?

(So all y'all hoes and skeezers, yo bust this)</pre>
