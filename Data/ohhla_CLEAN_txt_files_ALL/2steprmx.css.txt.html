All the bottle poppin'. Patron we rockin

[Kanye West]
Uh uh uh uh yeah
Me and Cass got flows until the beat run out
I told you motherfuckers before we in the house 

And we standin on the couch
With my drink and my two step my drink and my two step
Three glasses in a row you start to think I was Q-tip
Bartender pour a round I took a few sips
Stubblin', fallin' down, I ain't drunk that's my new step
Now why would I listen to bullshit they shovel
When they taste level ain't at my waist level
I'm fly get on a plane jet lagged already
I'm tired, the go yard bags is heavy
I'm fire the flow hard as a Chevy
I told her me like Ye, she said she like me, ha
But when she see me with a C. L. like Pete Rock 

She just wanna grab a microphone and beat box
Even in high school I was already the special kid
First pack of condoms I asked for extra big
Now I got a flow they sit me right next to B.I.G.
And all these old rappers don't know where the exit is
But but but but no buts nigga 

What nigga
We fired motherfuckers, Donald Trump nigga
I'm killin' these niggas can't front niggas
Now let's drink to that until drunk niggas

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
I got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
Got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
It's on, it's on, it's on and I'm home
Get the patron and tell them that it's on
All the Bottle poppin
Patron we rockin
All the Bottle poppin
Patron we rockin
Err Everybody drunk
Err Everybody drunk
And I'm home get the patron and tell them that it's on

[Cassidy]
It's remix time
We rich time
Shine like sequence time cause he did time
But then he came home grabbin' the Mics and bought rap back to life yea he that nice
I'm rocky like a package of white
You see that ice
Nigga please you never seen canaries that bright
I shine I make it look like day time at night
I could never turn the lights off until I take my ice off
Yellow and white chain Yellow and White cross
I been a boss ever since I took my diapers off
I like to floss I can get you and ya wife divorced
Ya'll separate before I take her on a second date
You can speculate who comin' in second place
Cause I got the number one record out check it out
I got my drink n my 2 step
It's on now
November 6 is the day that it's goin' on

[Chorus]

[Ne-Yo]
So many shots that I can't see straight
All these women around me cats still sayin he can't be straight
Give me ya girl and some platinum patron
When she come home you can ask her is me straight
She might smile a lot but she won't speak much
Yawnin' cause last night she ain't sleep much
She won't even talk about what we did
Just smile close her eyes and say yes he is
I'm on my Rick James and it's a celebration
Neither are you little mama and here's another
Celebrate the return of the hustla

[Chorus]

[Cassidy]
Yeah I go by the name of Buzz
My album be in stores November the 6
It's celebration time
Ne-Yo, Kanye, Swizz Beats, I appreciate y'all comin through doin' what y'all do
Y'all know we made history this time around
This one of the biggest remixes I ever heard
For real for real
This goin down real major
I'm out</pre>
