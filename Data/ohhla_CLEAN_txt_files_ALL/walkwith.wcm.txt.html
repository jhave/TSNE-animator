Ha-ha, yeah
Will I make it to see tomorrow
Ain't no tellin
This one right here, for all the riders
No matter what side you on
Peep game

Welcome to the killing fields
Nigga, the home of the G's
Land of the nymphos and murderers
Still G's and never C's
Careful of what the jaw breakers
Paper chase, parole piss test takers
To make us all the roof makers
Playas, best to keep your crew tight, and game in check
Cuz haters it's getting harder and harder to protect
I be peepin the animosity, how these niggas be watchin me
Ready to catch me slippin so that they can cut the glock on me
Gots to be clever, when now they grindin for your cheese
Cuz when it be comin to drama, my city's under siege
Watch who you're talkin to to, and keep your eyes on em
Cuz the closest nigga to ya is the nigga with wise on em
I rise on em, so now they label me a menace 
But they don't understand the wicked shit that I done witnessed
187's, 211's to drivebys
While most niggas divin for the Z-25, come on

[Chorus:]
Walk with me
As we journey through the land of the C's and the B's
And the crooked ass police
Walk with me
On this suicidal mission through the central
We gots 44's for cresidentials
Walk with me
As we journey through the land of the C's and the B's
And the coward ass police
Walk with me
On this suicidal mission through the central
We gots 44's for cresidentials
 
Now as I look to my riz-ight and to my liz-eft
I see my siz-elf starin face to face with hisself 
Will I live to see my little one grow to be a G
Like his daddy W from the dub S C (look at that)
I keep the guts to keep the heat on ya
And watch your enemies cuz they creep on ya
Now when time comes around for my name to be called
I'd rather die with it on me then not have it all
Stalkin, walkin in my big blue Chucks
They take this man, maddogin, ready to biz-ust
Yeah I walk through the valley of late nighter homicide
G riders into the makers of a buckin Impala
How far will I make it
Cuz I'm related, I know I'm highly hated
Affiliated, tomorrow ain't promised so at night I pray
I live to give it up for the hood another day

[Chorus:]
Walk with me
As we journey through the land of the C's and the B's
And the crooked ass police
Walk with me
On this suicidal mission through the central
We gots 44's for cresidentials
Walk with me
As we journey through the land of the C's and the B's
And the trigger happy police
Walk with me
On this suicidal mission through the central
We gots 44's for cresidentials

Drama more drama more drama more drama
Niggas are goin crazy for this mother fuckin dollar
I done seen em turn G's to snitches
Browns to kissers, niggas like used to consider reel to reel bitches
Niggas done switch-ded turn from killas to powder
Bust up, I'm pumpin, crack and tore that ass up and
Bitches I used to fuck in 96
Is now turnin tricks for hits cuz they addicted to glass dicks
Suckin niggas off for the green 
The ex-class felon notorious now the deadbeet queen
Check out her body, take a look at how the crack took toll
Went from being fine as hell to look at my guest or roll
I'm swoll, a boss with a perm and a frown
They say chicks don't run for witness partic a clown
I'm tryin to stay strong and mantain my stroll
But the neighborhood just ain't the same no more, uh-uh

[Chorus:]
Walk with me
As we journey through the land of the C's and the B's
And the crooked ass police
Walk with me
On this suicidal mission through the central
We gots 44's for cresidentials
Walk with me
As we journey through the land of the C's and the B's
And the scandalous ass police
Walk with me
On this suicidal mission through the central
We gots 44's for cresidentials

Uh, yeah, uh
Mother fuckers better take heed 
Cuz love don't live here no more
South Central L.A.
The modern day plantation
Where every nigga's guilty by affiliation
