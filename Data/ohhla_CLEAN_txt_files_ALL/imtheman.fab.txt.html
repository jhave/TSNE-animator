[Chorus: Red Cafe]
Excuse me! I happen to be the boss man
Excuse me! I happen to be the weatherman
Excuse me! I happen to be the ice man
Excuse me! I happen to be the dopeman
And I'm the man - yes, shorty I'm the man
I'm the man - yes, shorty I'm the man
And I'm the man - yes, shorty I'm the man
I'm the man - yes, shorty I'm the man

[Fabolous - over second half of Chorus]
That's me
The motherfuckin man, 'Lo-so
Due to the present in your past
In present where your man bitch?

[Fabolous]
Yes, I'm the man, yes shorty I'm the man
I'm so fly there's no tellin when I'ma land
You tryin to come up on somethin mami I'm the player
So play the cards you was dealt baby I'm the hand
Young Denzel, I'm the inside man
They open they legs to let me inside man
I work the middle, call it an inside job
The hey mon, I got ten side jobs
The boss man, the ice man and weatherman
The weed man for Redman and Method Man
The dope man, the gun man, the mailman
The spokesman, the cheer man, the salesman
Used to spread the white shit like hail man
And I moved more bags than the bellman
Now I'm the man of the da-da-da-da-damn
If you ain't get the message let me tell you who I am (BITCH~!)

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
Yeah... I'm the man - yes, shorty I'm the man
Lookin for some good shit, then I'm your man
Just say my name three times like Candyman
I pop up, fix it up like a handyman
You know how the man do, Coupe is all mad new
Ginoblis, but the truck is on Kobes
Through the bulletproof when you're in the Sport man
The slugs come through your window like grown man
Aww man~! There go your man again
I fifth him up, stiff him up like a mannequin
I ain't trippin but dude think he the Man of Steel
He slippin up and he don't even see banana peels
And one night I made plans to do him
The bitch is so easy a caveman could do it
She know I'm the man of the da-da-da-da-damn
But F-Y-I, let me tell you who I am (BITCH~!)
