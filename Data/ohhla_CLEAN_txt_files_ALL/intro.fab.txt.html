[Fabolous]
Ladies and gentlemen
I now welcome you to the Gangsta Grillz {"Gangsta, gangsta"}
{"DJ Drama!"} Drama! You know what this is right?
{"Gangsta Grizzill!"} This is that
The, the Grillz, the the, the Grillz {*4X*}

You see I come from the bottom, but I stay on the top
You might need a ladder shorty cause I'm way on the top
That's right I'm rich and I'm young like it say on my top
And if you ask my bottom bitch, bet she say I'm on top

"You see I come from bottom, but I stay on the top" {*scratched*}

You see I come from the bottom, but I stay on the top
You might need a ladder shorty cause I'm way on the top {"Gangsta Grizzill!"}
That's right I'm rich and I'm young like it say on my top
And if you ask my bottom bitch, bet she say I'm on top
I got no patience for slow hoes, so catch up bitch
The best be comin to those who wait but I ain't ketchup bitch
I flip fast as lightswitch (hey) that's right bitch (hey)
I don't swing at e'rything, just the right pitch
You're over a 8, you're over the plate
Send her over send her over I Red Rover your date
Tell your boo boo don't get cuckoo go 'head over the hate
You know how many people end up dead over they dates?
She's a GROUPIE, when I head over it's late
But pull a LUPE, soon as the head's over I skate
Yeah, I'm "Kick Pushin," leave they ass whooshin
I just push for the head, you can say I'm mushin
Slide on these Nikes with my name in the cushion
Same style as the plane they fly President Bush in
(Okay okay okay okay) And I'm gone with the wind
Mixtape bullshit, I am on it again, yes

We back baby~! It's Loso
I told you so, so you know so man
Street Fam, the city slicker's back baby
Ay Drama man
Help me let these muh'fuckers know what's goin on man!
(I don't think they know baby)
These niggaz is a lil' slow or somethin out here
I'ma slap these niggaz upside they head
Fin' to catch these niggaz up real quick, let's go
This is that {"Gangsta Grizzill!"}

The, the Grillz, the the, the Grillz {*2X*}

[DJ Drama]
I mean, it was only right
New year, new money
We had the connect! Why wouldn't we?
They try to compete?
The fuck outta here, haha
I ain't gotta tell y'all niggaz my name no more!
AMG! Street Fi-di-di-damn!</pre>
