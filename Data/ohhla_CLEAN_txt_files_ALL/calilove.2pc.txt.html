California love!

1-California...knows how to party
  California...knows how to party
  In the citaaay of L.A.
  In the citaaay of good ol' Watts
  In the citaaay, the city of Compton
  We keep it rockin!  We keep it rockin!

[Verse One: Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west  
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest  
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
the state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens 
lean mean money-makin-machines servin fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin rap tunes 
ever since honeys was wearin sassoon
Now it's '95  and they clock me and watch me 
Diamonds shinin lookin like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to tha Bay  
Your city is tha bomb if your city makin pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way  
Dre puttin it down for 
Californ-i-a
(repeat 1)

2-Shake it shake it baby
  Shake it shake it baby
  Shake it shake it mama
  Shake it Cali
  Shake it shake it baby
  Shake it shake it shake it shake it...

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Out on bail fresh out of jail, California dreamin
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin hoochies screamin
Fiendin for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
where cowards die, and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearin Chucks not Ballies (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grands
Worldwide let 'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecranz
Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam, it's Westside 
so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre 
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down, give me love!
(rpt 1)

(dre) now make it shake...

(rpt 2)

[Outro: Dre, 2Pac]
Uh, yeah, uh, Long Beach in the house, uh yeah
Oaktown, Oakland definitely in the house hahaha
Frisco, Frisco
(Tupac) hey, you know LA is up in this 
Pasadena, where you at
Yeah, Inglewood, Inglewood always up to no good
(Tupac) Even Hollywood tryin to get a piece baby
Sacramento, sacramento where ya at? yeah

Throw it up y'all, throw it up, Throw it up
Let's show these fools how we do this on that west side
Cause you and I know it's tha best side

Yeah, that's riight
West coast, west coast
Uh, California Love
California Love </pre>
