Ask yo mama!

Ask your mama
She know, she used to do it too
You can ask your mama

Ask your mama
She know, she used to do it too
You can ask your mama

Mama used to say that I would never change
I bet your mama said it too
Mama said that I was fast for my age
Daddy said that mommy was too

Well, ask your mama
She know, she used to do it too
You can ask your mama

Ask your mama
She know, she used to do it too
You can ask your mama

Mama, tell me why are you ashamed of me?
Was I conceived at both your will?
Sometimes I wonder was I meant to be alive
Was I just a slip of a pill?

Well, ask your mama
She know, she used to do it too
You can ask your mama

Ask your mama
She know, she used to do it too
You can ask your mama

She was a skeezer!

Mama, all I get is B's day after day
I think you want me for yourself
Why, go 'head bitchin 'bout the time I'm comin home
Daddy's bustin nuts somewhere else

Ask yo mama!

Ask yo mama!

Ask yo mama!

Ask yo mama!

She was a skeezer...</pre>
