[ CHORUS ]
I been to every city, state and street
From what I see
These niggas don't want it with me
So now I'm comin for the love that y'all were keepin from me
Finally
These niggas don't want it with me
And I'm a whole lot bigger than I look on TV
So physically
These niggas don't want it with me
So if you feel how I feel come and say it with me
Loudly
These niggas don't want it with me

[ VERSE 1 ]
Yo, who this little boy that's tryin to rhyme like me?
And worship me like Jon B worship black pussy
He pushin me to the point I wanna smack him, yo
(Yo duke, he tryin to steal your fans like Chico did D'Angelo's)
If imitation was acid, I'd have nothin
Left but jewerly, 52 teeth and a belt buckle
(Nigga, your skills are to die for)
During writers block I still create (what?)
Words of wisdom like they passed the lips of Buddah
And who the sharpshooter that claim he gonna kill me when he see me?
But wouldn't aim remote at a 100" color TV
Nigga, I'm off at the heezy, you see that?
Your record company done hired Chino XL to come and repossess they deal back
So now I put the fly in your eye like an Ethiopian starving
Life the game that you will no longer take any part in
You shouldn'ta start em, y'all done done it
You have to buy a microscope to read the list of rappers' names that want it
What

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Yo, shake my hand, I snap your wrist off
Been God on Earth so long the one in Heaven's pissed off
You soft, I'm up the echelon
The only other hot cats I seen on a plate was at a Chinese food restaurant
I get the raunch sex and didn't need the Range
I fuck your bitch for free and she can keep the change
I'm pretty as a bitty but my gats make noise
Yeah, with more female fans than the 'Blackstreet Boys'
I'm known for stealin niggas' wives like I stole niggas' huffy
Play tuffy, get beat and boxed like Doug E.
You lucky I shot my last slug in a club 
I'm Alizé and Hennessy in reverse, I got a passion for killin thugs
You're askin for spillin blood useless
I turn the most popular rapper from 'That's my muthafucka!' to 'Who this?'
I survive whole clubs jumpin me
But nigga, you halt cause I'm a Ryder like the moving truck company

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Bzzzzzz... you're shocked with Chino electricty
I'm black when it's convenient like Mariah's ethnicity
Considered a major at literature when rhyming
I'm diesel, horses goin Chino backriding
Dissin XL for wealth is bad for your health
But I'ma do me like a took Ecstacy with myself
They been keepin me on the shelf for ages
But me retire, it'll be easier to change every light bulb in Vegas
Yo, my brain deserve its own infomercial for how it thinks
You can't be saved by coppin Tae-Bo with Billy Blanks
I turn on sinks and rock to the rhythm of the water drops that come out
Then freestyle till the whole New York reservoir run out
And walk with gun out for cats that wanna start somethin
I shine like I control the sun's off-and-on button
MC's are mini-me's, my clones at 1/4th the size
(Yeah baby...) rappers try to shag me for my rhymes
