Prolog: Well, let's get started! Let's make a gender! That ok with you?  
disgusts me; forget it! But anyway... Let chemical love be our primary
descriptor! chemical love. taking viagra, makes me wet 574 times! But what
is chemical love here, its category? Do you feel your gender is close to
chemical love. :In any case, you must contact me about this...

what is the point of this useless, trivial, and murderous exercise?
2002 sticks in the maw of 7 / 11/ 13. what a terrific mouth!
2003 bottoms out, what is called a "prime" as in "steak."
and 2001 comes, what? close to the grain of 23, 29?
better to perform the head-first luge at 80 miles an hour down a chute
than to worry about the palindromic which remains only for a year.
in 6009 we will be upside-down again, better not to perform downhill
ski racing which last killed a world champion smashing into the 
machine.
the ski forms its own track within acceptable bounds or boundaries.
leaning against the object of the head-first luge, one comes to the
conclusion that factoring might not have been useless after all.

proper moment and solution. if i were younger, alcibiades, i would 
attempt one or the other, but certainly not both." - apollonius of rhodes.

Azure and I bought wedding rings today. I'm still reading Lacan's Feminine
Sexuality again, Bachelard's The Poetics of Space, Dirac's The Principles
of Quantum Mechanics. I found an anthology of Erasmus' works; I'm continu-
ing with Rabelais but the old Modern Library translation incorporates
notes from the French edition into the text which creates vortices unknown
in the original. O'Reilly sent me a copy of Dreamweaver in a Nutshell for
Dw4, which I highly recommend. I also received Albert Ayler's Spiritual
Unity and Bells on cds (I was with the original company) as well as Orn-
ette Coleman's Town Hall, 1962. The Ayler are my favorite jazz recordings
of all time. Traded some books in and found Essays on Sino-Korean Music-
ology: Early Sources for Korean Ritual Music by Robert Provine. I wonder
how much aak and gagaku are related. Also traded for Peter Hay, Broadway
Anecdotes; I know nothing about Broadway and am frightened of musicals.  
Tomorrow we're seeing Kevin Magee and I'm bringing him copies of Archive
4.2, Et2, and a pamphlet on the Miccosukee language. I heard from the FIU
teacher's union today; they talked about publicizing the termination,
since my situation establishes a bad practice for faculty hiring. They
seemed also confused about my one-year tenure-track first-year contract,
but I haven't spoken to them directly; I heard in email. Yesterday Azure
and I trekked the 14 miles to the Shark Valley overlook and back. We're
going out with Gerald Jones on Sunday, but only half a mile or so; I want
to use a 35mm camera and telephoto for closeups of birds; reptiles and
fish I can approach, but not woodstorks which are fabulous and fabled. I
haven't started Solzhenitsyn's August 1914 which I bought a few days ago
(all my books except for the Dreamweaver are 2nd hand); I can't remember
whether I read it when it first came out. I'm still trying to think the
relationship between the mailart network (I have an old issue of Art
Papers devoted to it, and I've corresponded years ago with Ray Johnson and
James Lee Byars and Jon Held was my landlord in Dallas, his stamp-making
machinery next door) and the Internet and I'm also trying to think why
this sort of recuperation (which also involves the NE Thing company)  
matters. I wonder if the discussion of the _lu_ in the Sino-Korean book
might help me think through issues of fundamental ontology - the deep
structure of sound in relation for that matter to raga/rasa - but then
even with this I return and worry about unemployment, returning to New
York instability once again. I take pride in my students at FIU, and I
think they in me, but then that doesn't guarantee work in a period of
football and budget cuts. The union representative wants publicity to
prevent further cases, not to further my own. I need a copy of Dream-
weaver4; I only have 3, and 4 sounds terrific; I could finally clean up my
ratty homepage which doesn't run some of the scripts on the newest brow-
sers. Yesterday I revised my Archive 4.1 cdrom - now Archive 4.2, cleaning
out some of the older graphics, adding new ones. Kevin will get the first
copy; he's been in Siberia. I'll have another sleepless night first,
worrying about health and jobs, and we're having a cold spell. The car 
works after we replaced the battery. Something will get us there.

New Media Terror Course:


Please note attendance is mandatory and part of your grade. You will be
hung. You will survive scorpions. You will survive Survivor. You are also
required to have an anonymous email address - and to check your email at
least several times a week. Some of the class participation is online. You
are expected to spread at least one virus/week across the campus.

Assignments:

a. If you have not taken the course before - there are two projects - one 
due at the end of the course, and one at the midway point. If you don't 
live past the midway point you get an A.

Midway: A piece in any non-traditional medium (performance, sound, video,
cannon, computer, tank, html) dealing with either: Issues of self; or:  
Light; or: Shark Valley in the Everglades; or: why WE are better than THEY
are; or KILL FACTOR: SPECIAL EDITION.

Final: A work or works in any non-traditional medium dealing with a sub-
ject of your choice involving firearms and torture (water not included);
you should have decided this by the mid-February, and you should be
prepared to report on your progress during the class periods, to the
remaining students.

b. If you have taken the course before - you may continue working on your 
projects, as determined previously. If you are able to continue, your 
grade is a B maximum.

This course will consist of several components:

1. Going through the Michael Rush book in the beginning; looking at other 
work; looking at work on the Internet and Net.Art. Assignment: Why is 
Net.Art dead? If you think it is alive, kill it off. If you cannot kill it 
off, you may use firearms and torture as above. This is necessary for a 
passing grade. Note that Net.Art is tricky: Turning off your machine does 
NOT kill the webpage for everyone else!

2. An overview of the Internet and the work presented on and through it; 
this involves the history, demographics, and culture of the Net, presented 
in brief. Assignment: Begin a commercial Website which deadends at least 
15 trillion email addresses. Create a form that replies with at least 15 
megabytes of broken higher ascii to every "please unsubscribe" email 
address.

3. Learning the components of the digital video studio - these include:  
Premier, Imovie, Movieshaker, Moviemaker, and FinalCut Pro. You do not
have to know these in depth, but if you are working in video, you should
try and learn at least one of these well. Assignment: Naked sex involving 
at least one consenting animal to be presented live in class and on the 
Net. No children, but if you lose a limb you automatically get an A. If 
the tape makes money, you get 25% of the profits plus hospitalization.

4. Learning about the other components available: audio including Audio-
mulch and Soundforge; imaging including Gimp and Photoshop; 3d modeling
with Blender and Mathematica; and anything else that might be of use to
you in your projects. Doom and Quake are permitted providing a parallel
course setup is created with live ammunition and human targets. Any
killing or injuring of animals strictly prohibited. Mathematica may be
used in the design, development, and production of small-scale nuclear
weapons; we can use the populated parts of South Florida for trial runs.

You are not expected to be an expert in any of these programs; you are 
expected to be self-motivated if you want to explore or use any of them in 
depth. Please note that the course is not program-based, but is concerned 
instead with the entire new media area. Assignment: Create a work based 
entirely on Allah/Christ/Buddha/Confucius/God/Nothing/ or the (non) tran- 
scendence of your choice. The work must prove beyond the shadow of a doubt 
that this transcendence is really _it._ A second and shorter work should 
define _it._ A third work should portray the resulting carnage. If the 
third work cannot be carried out because of sudden death syndrome, you 
receive an A. If you cannot get a grade, you receive an A. 

5. Learning how to use microphones, anthrax, digital still cameras, plas-
tique, crowbars, small-scale nuclear weapons, Internet spam and video
cameras. We will cover camera/sound/planting/fertilizing (see sex above)/
harvesting/coverup techniques. Learning how to hide violations of civil
rights; learning how to hide suspected terrorists; learning how to hide
anyone; and learning how to eliminate civil rights/terrorists/anyone for
extra credit.

6. Learning how and where to distribute new media work and what to do if 
your audience no longer exists. What to do if you hate your audience. What 
to do if your audience hates you. Last gasp: What to do if your audience 
loves Net.art.

Please do not expect this course to be highly-structured! It isn't - it
depends on you, and your ability to survive or court death (for our
purposes the two are equivalent). The length of the course is inversely
proportional to its success; it will be best if we no longer make it
through the year (or if hospitalization is a MUST).

Good luck.

i'm using the program to write what with difficulty is only obscure - the
relati on of standard pitch within the Korean aak, dependent on
measurement, the cycle of fifths, Chinese and Korean sources, to construct
a _length_ that is uniform a nd in harmony, so that the emperor, not the
people, will exist in the complete c oherency of the cosmos, the
measurement related to grains of millet "which did n ot agree with ancient
measurements." for the rulers, ministers, people, affairs, and objects
must all be in proper order, the music must be proper for rites and
ceremonies, the length of the tonic or base or fundamental, the ground

thenceforth carried throu ghout the land. instruments may play in octaves
or unison, always referencing th e tonic, not wandering too far away in

Lacan, "Any speaking being whatever is inscribed on one side or the other.
On the left, on the bottom line, For all X thetaX indicates that it is
through the phallic function that man takes up his inscriptions at all,
except that this function finds its limit in the existence of an X through
which the function thetaX, is negated there exists X such that not
thetaX." ... "Opposite, you have the inscription of the woman share of
speaking beings." "These are the only possible definitions of the share
called man, or else woman, for anyone who finds themselves in the position
of inhabiting language." but the woman might equally take up the man,
there are sides and resides, sires and desires. the functions of the _lu_
are grounded in the material of the world; in this discourse, this
inhabitation, they are grounded in the abstractions of psychoanalytical
metapsychologies. :perhaps one misses this, misinterprets the formula, in
which everything gathers on the side of the masculine which is thereby
deconstructed within Lacan; the _lu,_ the standard pitches, are neither
totality nor bifurcated; the harmony is such that Lacan resides on the
fact of an automatism that considers a unary viewpoint in perspective, and
aak, the ritual music, continues in the manner of the perspective of Fan
Kuan or Kuo Hsi, that is entering and leaving everywhere upon the plane or
matrix of the image itself, the dream screen without the metapsychology.
:within Lacan's Feminine Sexuality, edited by Mitchell and Rose, in God
and the _Jouissance_ of <strike>The</strike> Woman. A Love Letter,
consider For all X, thetaX; there exists X such that not thetaX (both on
the side of the masculine); not there exists X such that not thetaX; not
for all X thetaX. one runs into totality dispersed among the matrix such
that thetaX need not descend from X; there is no ladder of descent; there
are logical operations beyond the cycles of the fifths which are recursive
and cyclical productions; there is the potential with this calculus for a
semantics rendering everywhere into all dominions; the universe of
discourse surely may be externally defined; it is the affairs of men and
women; the side of the woman is not there exists X such that not thetaX;
not for all X thetaX, or so one interprets the formula with the usual
petit-a/crostics portending / contorting biology.::

Your soldier / dissolves my in both cases one tries to understand the
language and concepts, the therapeutic of reading, listening, hearing.
this is the domain of ignorance of the extensions of logic, of the
phenomenology of _lu,_ of the readings and rereadings which accompany this
annotation, what can only be an annotation /naked-woman in war-time fuck

Story


The older man turns to the woman and says, "I don't know why you're making
such a fuss over this. I did speak to your son, and I thought there was an
understanding. He seemed to agree that there was an understanding between
us."

The older woman turns to the man and says, "I don't know where this is
coming from. We spoke about it a long time ago, all three of us. I have
eyes which are looking in your direction. I can see you clearly from my
perspective but I cannot see behind me."

The man says, "I can hear you even when I'm not looking at you. I will
take the memory of this conversation out of the room with me."

 He waves his hands around the room.

 He says, "I will be seeing other things when I walk and will take care
 not to fall anywhere."    

 She walks towards him and turns. 

  She says, "When you leave my vision will continue and I will hear as
  well. I will be hearing other things and seeing the same things but I
  will not be seeing you. Tomorrow I will remember this conversation and I
  may well remember it for a long while. I will be walking in other places
  and my steps will not be as these steps."

  He says, "When I think of other things I do not see them or hear them,
  but I continue to see and hear you when I am looking in your direction.
  When I am looking in another direction, I am seeing other things. I
  continue to hear you. When I think of other things I imagine them but I
  know where my feet are and I am keeping my balance at all times."

  She says, "It is a shame my son will be in the theater so soon. He will
  have to memorize what others have said, and will have to see in some way
  what others are telling him to see. Also he will have to hear."

  He says, "He will have to hear what he already knows. He will remember
  what he sees and hears. He will leave the room and will see other things
  and hear other things. He will think of more and more things. He will
  think of a great many things."

  She says, "He will be thinking of far more things than I am thinking of.
  When I leave you I will be thinking of other and different things, and I
  will be keeping my balance at all times. I will be seeing where I am
  looking, and I will be looking where I am seeing. I will be hearing in
  every direction, what is near to me."

  He says, "I will also be looking where I am seeing and I will be hearing
  other things, and we will not be hearing your son or seeing your son."

  She says, "We are not hearing or seeing my son. My son is not here. My
  son is keeping his balance at all times and he is seeing where he is
  looking."

  He says, "Yes, we are not touching him, and we are not touching each   
  other. I am not feeling the outside of your skin. I am looking where I 
  am seeing."

  She says, "I am feeling my skin from the inside and the outside. I am
  looking at my skin. I am seeing my hand touching my face. I will carry 
  this touching with me. I can touch in every direction, what is near to
  me."

  She walks towards the door and leaves.

  He walks towards the door and leaves.

THEY GO INTO ANOTHER BRIGHTLINE SHOOTING SESSION:old julu-program, hold me
in good staid, in the glade azure and i with stubbles, she's mouthing
bubbles, her cunt's a brilliant light against the ferns, my face burns
with rubbles and anticipation, drools, i'm pissing in the saw palmetto,
my bellies huge, like rouge her labia, i'm all wet drowning in her stream,
that part's a dream, her tunnel's lit, did i say at night the flashlight
shows us path and swath, my cock's cut on spanish bayonet, i fuck a pine,
she's mine, she says i'm your hole, use me, her skirt's hiked up, she's
all smiles for miles, my thick lips drool on my tool, we're rattling in
dark dank muck, we fuck :4:2 i hold her asshole open next to saw grass cut
to hold the dew in two, we're like glue, stuck in fuck, the cameras
chatter, our holes spatter the last drop or plop into each other's eyes,
shit's no surprise, we wallow in the hollow, old julu-program lie me like
your maid, don't let me fade, azure's been made and made again, i'm her
maid-man and then :blown bellies out, her crack's blurred against the stem
or trunk, a hunk, you might miss her ass, she looks a lass, shaved, i'm
perfectly behaved, my balls are thick and musk, my cock a tusk, my laugh
is long and hard, she's my bard, she's tearing at my skin, she wants me
in, the glade's wet with piss and semen, it smells like perfect water,
azure looks a daughter, i'm her rutted father covered with her lather,
just wet hair everywhere and bare there

alan and azure spend themselves, exhaust themselves. they turn 
themselves into debris, into excretion, detritus. you will know 
them naked, know their lesions, their gonorrheas, syphilis, their
hiv, their herpes, their disjunctions. you will know their torn
bodies, bodies on the brink of war. you will know alan's flaccid
cock, his aging body, azure's young tumescent body, their
bruised breasts and necks. when you see them you will see
through them. they will confuse this with politics, with exile,
with refugee. you will know alan's heavy belly, azure's small
labia, alan's asshole aureole, azure's small tight hole. you will
know shoulders that bear the brunt of worlds, minds discarding
clothes, their pathetic truths, the groping in their eyes. you will
grope them in confusion. you will fall for them. they are just
like this, lesions you will fall for. they are ruined. they ruined 
each other. you can have them for all they care.

Timothy Leary, in his Introduction, page 26, in LSD: The Consciousness-

little bee, you are hurting no one but yourself, don't you see how large i 
am, you will die soon, you are protecting yourself, you are protecting 
everything in your world, little crayfish, your claws hurt every so 
slightly, don't you see how big i am, i will place you carefully back in 
your world, you have protected yourself, your claws have said to me, i am 
in my world, i am protecting everything in my world, little fish, i see 
you are suffocating, i see you are gasping for breath, trying to return to 
your water, trying to protect your young, i will place you back beneath 
the water, little snail, do not walk across this path, i will pick you up, 
don't you see how great i am, you return deep within your shell, you are 
protecting everything in your world, i will place you in the garden, i 
will take you to the wild, little turtle, don't you see how dangerous this 
is, you will try and claw me, don't you see how big i am, you withdraw 
your head, you are protecting everything in your world, i will place you 
in the pond, i will place you in the stream, little bird, don't you see 
how large i am, your wing is not broken, your legs are not broken, you are 
protecting everything in your world, you have protected yourself and your 
nest, i will walk quietly away, little frog, little mouse, i will walk

[Analysis: within a hyper-complex ecosystem of intersecting biomes, "muck"  
or "swamp" or "mire" translates into "mess" or "mass" as if substance
lacked striation, or as if the striation were random, indecipherable. on a
micro-level, however, interpretation is clear; from this, the level of
periphyton or still lower (organic molecular transformations), the mess
dissembles, devolves, deconstructs, into interrelationships - these are
readable as if nearly decomposed from the lower strata. does Hoelderlin
ever leave the All? the dank chained unity of Greece and Germany in his
texts overlooks the depth of difference. my greatest fear, recognized by
Hoelderlin himself, is of this all; the translation of the epigram is
poorly rendered by Hamburger, as if it had to be grounded in utterable
prose, resolving muck. slough slog - Everglades off-trail walk through
resolving muck.]

cancer

returning again to a writing space, blank screen, words messaged across
2000 kilometers. an occasion of cancers; it is surrounding us, killing our
friends and relatives, killing people we have known, many of them young.
suddenly, there are triple narratives coming in, triple stories of diagno-
ses, radiations, internal organs, contusions, exhausted on the brink of
death's seduction. the human condition always reduces to the same old
tired situation of wisdom come too late; the elderly are wise but organic-
ally weakened, and it is the stuff of young muscle, hormones, and force
that dominates the world. give the lie to this among elderly generals,
heads of states, murderers all. but young and broken we are with the heat
of revolt and the slaughter of innocents, and old and catastrophic we
become, sliding into inchoate silence and isolation, comprehending the
world, with no one to listen, less reason for speech. now cancer takes
away whole universes on the edge of understanding; messiahs are elderly,
silenced with truth bubbling from their tongues. everything is confused as
wealth buys power at any age. i am still, even now, surprised that it
cannot buy health, that slaughter takes rich and poor alike, that diseases
of long suffering cannot be siphoned off by technologies of the upper
classes. the world is increasingly lesioned; those who have cancer are in
the vanguard of devastation. it is our failure as a species that we have
not the time to grow wise, but only the time to kill, only the time to 
die.

Seals the signs are early Chinese ideograms for breathing, circulating, 
soul, the sign just above the genitals is negation, still in use today:
working through a form of deconstruction

{in window 1 i continue to write:}

people lose their identities here. the screen jiggles as if broken. their 
names are separated from the descriptions of their lost belongings

{in window 4 i continue to write:}

i work with broken things, code as if it wouldn't work, bodies as if 
they're falling apart, text that has bones in it coming to the surface 

{texts in window 1 and window 4 mix}

it's as if they're amputated, as if they're blinded, in the middle of
human artifacts, human designs
they're sentient, they can't read the codes, they have so much to tell us,
they're silenced by zeros and ones
they don't understand the vast landscape of binaries, they have no feeling
for addresses, they murmur softly to one another
their understanding is beyond our comprehension, their knowledge
unsurpassed, our coding is our own, their coding is their own
the wires are humming, as if carrying sensibility multiplexing beyond our
wildest imaginations
organisms of such intelligence, bridge the great divide, please, we beg
you, come to us come to us

by virtue of the indent, language becomes stuff
 it sits there, gnawing at the margin, as if something else were going
 on. it continues in this fashion - there was a pressure applied, a
 sliding effect 
  no such thing exists in any form whatsoever. someone thinks: it's a
  conscious choice, the words were put there, they were arranged in
  such-and-such a fashion
  in reality it could be anything at all. but it gnaws, slips, slides
  forward, just about to topple, this substance of language, this
  phonemics which sticks in the throat,
   the most vulnerable part of the body. there is no stopping speech, nor
   syntax, once language moves from protolanguage, protosyntax, to this
   incipient point,
   then back again, as now. a conjuration 'in print' of language's
   foreignness, its other of any other. as if we're faced of a sudden,
   faced of a night, with this determinative
   (indicated by a push
   (indicating by a toppling, or what appears to be an arrangement
    perhaps a contract made by someone or something)
    perhaps the very nature of a contract itself)

Bodee, Sonnet of Eschatology


Do Come In and Look Around! Hey! See the Body.
You see Bedei, #1, Girl, Boy, Bodi, Bodi, i#1, iBuda, iBodei, iBedei,
iBudi, iBedee radio here.
iBedee radio: This is the same as Mountain Time. You are listening
Mountain Time.
iBudi radio: This is Eastern Time. This is the last radio. You are 
listening to the last radio.
The last radio: Hello. Now we will play you a tune. Once there was a
mountain. Now there is no mountain. Will you go away. Will you go away.
You see #1. You see i#1. {i#1}^2=#1. This is a sonnet of apocalypse.
This is your imaginary. State the Galois group of the imaginary.
The Body rising up, the Body rising up. This is Western time. This is
the last Western. You are listening to the last Western.
Now we will play you the Silver Bullet Overture. Do come in and end.
