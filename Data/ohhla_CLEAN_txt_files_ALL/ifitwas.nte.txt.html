Ah, Ah, Ah, Father live my life (2000)
Tryin' to do what's right, Ah

If it was meant to be, I'll store a whole key, and push a Bentley
Build my own mansion on Mars, go down in history
If it was meant to be, I'd go platinum in a day
An If it was meant to be there'd be no po-lice where I stay

[C-Note]
Oh well, I live in Hell
I'm trapped up in this ghetto
Crack sales, we livin' well
But still ain't nuttin' to let go
If it was meant to be, so set yourself free
If we ever make it out this ghetto I sold my shit to C, that's on me
I'm jus a G, I'm tryin' to get my life together
I know through all the sunshine there be some frightning weather
I ever, you gotta live your life slow
If ya ass in a rush you might get trapped in the snow
With, nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
An if, it was meant to be, I'd be nation wide (nation wide)
Give me the world an all that's left up in it
Bump-in nation, ridin' broke while rich an independent

[Revised Hook]
If it was meant to be then everybody I know would be a G
An all the homies doin' time in the pen be set free
If it was meant to be, I'd go platinum in a day
An If it was meant to be there'd be no po-lice where I stay

[Godfather]
If it was meant to be, I'd be a millionaire the next century
It's '99, Juelzie's out the penitentiary
Drug game done crashed, jus like the stock market
But weed'll never stop sellin, give me the blunt an spark it
If it was meant to be, God'll let me see tomorrow
Gotta go work for mine, I never had to borrow
And as for friends, that's somethin' that I never had
I love my mother to death, but what about my dad?
If it was meant to be, none of us would have to struggle
I pressed my luck with the Sotas to make my money double
A man of life, no stress no bills
I know some people that's broke, that wanna go an kill
If it was meant to be, you would have fame and fortune
Die a sinner, you'd go to Hell where it's scorchin'
So when the y2k, I found a new way
I make my own decisions, Don't care whatchu say...

[Revised Hook - C-Note]
If it was meant to be, I'd be known world wide
Four or five differnt Bentley's, parked outside
If it was meant to be (meant to be), I'd be locked behind bars
But still I'd rather ball with young ghetto stars

[Bun B]
Say man I'd already be platinum
An I'd already be rich
I'd already be in a house on a hill with a bad bitch
An I'd already be settin' trends in a 2001 Bendz
Lookin' at super models through a Cardy LN's
An I'd already be at the top of billboard for a month
An I'd already be on stage in the Summit with a blunt
I don't tool wit Lauryn Hill, not even bar an steel
Man I'd already know how to inside of a foreign field
An I'd already know how much they love me over seas
And how to blow a grand in quilla in Amsterdam wit clover G's
An I'd already know how tight my name in lights would look at night
While blowin' chocolate mixed with hash mixed with flight
Man I'd already know who killed Malcolm X and Kennedy
An who my real fathers was from niggaz who pretend to be
I'd already be readin on everybody who hate
If it was meant to be man I wouldn't even have to wait

If it was meant to be (x3)
