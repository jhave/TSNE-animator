Yo J. Rob
Gimme somethin that these niggaz can ride to

Lift it up! (Ahhh) Lift it up
Lift it up! (This goes for all the riders) Lift it up
(out there that's liftin up) Lift it up! Lift it up
(Gilla House) Lift it up! (LAD-IES...)

Aiyyo I can't explain, why I do it big
I shut 'em DOWN DOWN and I don't care who it is
I'm from the hood nigga, uhh, I take it there (YUP~!)
Windex on my windpipes, make it clear
Your lady naked here, put that cologne on me
That can of five grand, daddy yeah roll on me
She called her girlfriend, I said you're so phony
You cats stackin me, record through the phone on me
Go 'head, record baby, I ain't never scared
I stay sinnin, I'm from Jersey where the +Devils+ is
Go 'head LIFT IT UP, you know what the hell is
Come get your groove back BITCH, like Stella did
Aowww!

[Chorus]
Lift it up! Lift it up
Lift it up! (Six-fo') Lift it up (fat ass)
Lift it up! (Yamaha) Lift it up
Lift it up! Lift it up

[Redman]
You can smell that marijuana comin out of my veins
(Get your smoke on nigga!)
I'm just lookin for that hot chick to give me some brains
(Yeah, yeah, ay, ay)
I'm from the nine-zero, yeah I know how to ball
I whip a ride that's still on protocol (you lyin nigga!)
Psych I'm lyin nigga, I'm as broke as y'all
But I'm a HUSTLER and I don't sell dope at all
I just LIFT IT UP (lift it up) lift it up!
You got that kush rolled homey go on lift it up
Baby you got back, momma go on lift it up
You got that Yamaha, nigga go on lift it up
Aowww!

[Chorus]

[Redman]
You can smell that marijuana comin out of my veins
I'm just lookin for that hot chick to give me some brains
(Yeah, yeah, ay, ay)
LET'S GO~! {*echoes*}</pre>
