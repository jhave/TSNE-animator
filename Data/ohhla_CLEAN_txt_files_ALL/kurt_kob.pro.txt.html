[Proof talking]
This my last letter right here
Fuck this world, lets get the fuck outta here

[Proof]
I put my soul through the ink
Bless a path with thoughts at my thoughts
Before I grow extinct
My back-bone disowned by zone
Why roam? called home
But now on I'm all alone
Just Proof, no shine, no friends, just fans
No wonder my hands, tight where the Internet ends
I take back most of the flack
The stress smokes, press me close to the crack
Like my pops, the ghost of my past
Thyme and Mudd, Jay Dee and Stuckey
Lately I'm lucky, I don't hate me to touch me
Maybe I'm ugly inside, but smiling to make it
I love y'all dawg, and that's how ever you take it
The fame is an illusion, I'm still losing
In this game, with the rules and..
I feel clueless, the streets with the hills blue less
Cops knocking at the door, got me looking real foolish
But I still do this, like I love it, even though I thug it
Keep flossing lights in public, the subject y'all don't know
Stars won't grow, who would dream that scars would show?
Minus the MTV videos with slim
"Up in Smoke" D-12, and many shows with Em
It's still me dawg, no change for change
It's strange, when it pours it rains
I take it back..

[Chorus]
I wish I could take it back, I wish I could take it back
But it's too late
I wish I could take it back, I wish I could take it back
But it's too late

[Proof]
Always talking to Snuk hopin' he speak back
Wishin' my first son was here to reach at
Feeling detached
My brother Earl, and Wayne, that bail money for jail, y'all can keep  that
I've been deep before, ask Stillman
My hearts melting, tell the truth, I need help man
I hearts big but by sins bigger
Fuck the world, I don't feel like I can win niggaz
It's like I'm lost and I find only demons
I wanna quit, its like I'm tired of breathing
So my stress confess to a famous song
Em I love you, don't let this money change us dawg
1st Born, when I'm gone, grab the sign
Leave Naeem with the cream and his mom
And dear mamma, I use to hate you
Now I relate to, everything you did to make Proof
I love you..
Take it back

[Chorus]

[Proof]
All y'all see is Free from 106 and Park
Y'all don't know I risk my heart with this apart
From the streets, the groups, the friends, the foes
The jewels, the dick lickers and the hoes
What about me?
Sheltered with no guidance
Look at the finest, royal highness on some hot shit
Still living with the liquor and bud
Sometimes I wish for my demise, so I can kick it with Bugz
I wish it was real between us all
In the past, you should of seen us dawg
I die for Em and save Hailie, brave maybe
But just let them tears roll off my grave Shady
Kuniva n' Swift, how live does it get?
I meant to teach y'all niggaz to survive in this bitch
If we die to be rich, that makes me happy
And on another note, shit, don't hate me pappy
It's just that we look the same, you let the game take you
Your son game along and took the game
Since I took my own life, y'all feel a killa fo sho
Bizarre on the real, you the realest nigga I know
Strapping and busting ain't real, just tell your mans the truth
And that's why you've always been friends with Proof
Answer to all, I've always lied with truth
And before I pull the trigger, Denaun, I'm proud of you..</pre>
