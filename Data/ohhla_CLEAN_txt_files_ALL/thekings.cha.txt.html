Hey, we lit 'em up before Smallz, time to do it again
You ready?
Yeah, you know what it is
Chamillionaire also known as King Koopa
Also known as the Mixtape Messiah
And now also known as the Man on Fire
Reporting to you live from the gritty streets of Houston, Texas
And what you about to witness is something phenomenal
