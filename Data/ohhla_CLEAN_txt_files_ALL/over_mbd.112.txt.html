What is this? 
Numbers in your pocket 
I remember when you 
Used to throw those things away 
Why do you wanna keep in touch now? 
Who gave you a reason? 
To act so shady 

Baby you know 
You can call me anytime 
Anything you needed I would give it to you 
Ooh, that's how much I care for you 
You wanna act now 
Never call me back now 
Turning off your cell phone 
Girl you know that ain't cool 
Yes I don't understand baby 

(Prodigy)
Let's do it, come on
Listen, what ever happen to us
The love, the lust
We don't even kiss no more
It's nuttin like before
Now it's more pain than joy
It's makin me sick
Who'd evea think we be goin through this
Sunny dayz, everybody loves dem
But can we get through this lil bit of rainin
Damn, we stay arguin
So I guess this is it, it's so foul
How we can't work this out, it's over now

Chorus:
Baby it's a shame we gotta go through this 
We can't even talk 
Girl we don't even kiss 
I never would've thought 
We'd be breaking up like this 
But it's over now 
It's over now 

You think that I don't know what's going on 
Cause you're always home alone 
And I'm always out of town 
You need to stop trying to play me 
Cause you can't even fade me 
I know you're messing around baby 

Baby you know 
You can call me anytime 
Anything you needed I would give it to you 
That's how much I care for you baby 
You wanna act now 
Never call me back now 
Turning off your cell phone 
Girl you know that ain't cool 
Oh I don't understand baby 

Repeat Chorus (X2) 

Baby it's a shame 
A shame that we go through 
The things that we go through 
When you're in love with me 
And I'm in love with you 
I think that we should talk about our problems 
Instead of running away 
Oh baby it's a shame 
We couldn't work it out 
Forgot what love was all about 
And the feelings we had from the start 
My heart will always be with you, oh
Girl it's over 

Repeat Chorus till end</pre>
