[Young Buck]
Heyyyy! I gotta slow down
I said we gotta slow down
 
Let me take you back to high school, ninety-fo'
When at least when a nigga had time to go
Walk to the bus stop, sellin rocks on the way
Lil' bad motherfucker with a pocket full of yay
Fell in love with a shorty that was bad
I would go and skip class just so I could see that ass
But she was too fast, and I was too slow
Cause she wanted a nigga who already had dough
She found her a man who was like twenty-fo'
But what she didn't know that he had plenty hoes
She was too young; so now he got a new one
Cause shorty went and bought her a new gun
See when she catch this nigga she gon' do somethin
Not fight, but shorty gon' shoot somethin
But she never got a chance, a change of plans
Shot herself in the back puttin the gun in her pants
 
[Chorus: Young Buck]
Live life young nigga, quit tryin to be grown
You gon' miss momma when she dead and gone
So slow your roll  slow it down my nigga
Slow your roll  slow down my nigga
Live life lil' mama, quit tryin to be grown
You gon' miss daddy when he dead and gone
So slow your roll - c'mon gotta slow down
Slow your roll  think you gotta slow down
 
[Young Buck]
I got a graveyard tatted on my arm
So I'ma just start with my uncle William Hahn
My momma only brother, he served in the Navy
He lost his life because the war made him crazy
My nephew Shannen, 15 years old
When I think how he died I get real cold
Cause they found him in a field with some crack stones
There was no flesh, it was just bones
I was just home, with my cousin Craig
And then I got a phone call said they found him dead
So what's next, ain't went to Bizz funeral yet
Instead of one casket I need two of them shits
It don't quit, just when you think I'm seein better days
My auntie just find that she got AIDS
And it's fucked up, cause her life don't end
And she locked up, so she dyin in the pen', damn
 
[Chorus]
 
[Chester Bennington]
This can't be life, we're living
Cause I don't wanna live no more
I don't wanna live no morrrrrre
This can't be life, we're living
Cause I don't wanna live no more
I don't wanna live no morrrrrre
This can't be life we're living
Cause I don't want it no morrrrrre, no morrrrrre
This can't be life we're living
Cause I don't want it no morrrrrre
No mooooooo-orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre
 
[Chorus]
