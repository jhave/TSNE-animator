(Hook, Belo)
God help me out here
Cause I'm off my square
Please show me love, cause they don't care
Peepin' out the po-po through my rear-view
And I can still feel you

God help me out here
Cause I'm off my square
Please show me love, cause they don't care
Peepin' out the po-po through my rear-view
And I can still feel you

(Verse 1, Belo)
Ridin' late night, on Roosevelt road
Half a moon, still chilly, so I put on my coat
Lookin' up at the stars, so I grabbed a Newport
Ch-chhh... then a conversation started...
"God are you listenin', cuz I'm feelin' a little awkward
One of my oldest brothers died, and I feel I'm going backwards
Just a little confused, so I need some spiritual guidance
And if I can't add it, then I won't divide it
And if I can't seek it, then I won't find it
But my homie got killed, what should I do?
Hold on, I got revenge, his time is due
The pain is un-explainable, keep my eyes on You
I position, talkin' crazy, should I blast or stay cool?"
Damn... I gotta stay focused

(Hook, Belo)
God help me out here
Cause I'm off my square
Please show me love, cause they don't care
Peepin' out the po-po through my rear-view
And I can still feel you

God help me out here
Cause I'm off my square
Please show me love, cause they don't care
Peepin' out the po-po through my rear-view
And I can still feel you

(Verse 2, Chilla)
I gots to give all mine, to the capital, G-O-D
Because without Him, there'd be no me
And plenty times I was tempted in the past
To ask my daddy, was it his?
But my shorty's never trip, this house and Caddy's for the kids
Pray they carry on, even when I'm buried and gone
Bussin' and chillin', feelin' every area wrong
At thirteen wit' a bud habbit
And never learned shit, but how to toke B's and drug traffic
My biggest fear was bein' sober
Keep duckers from jackin' and gettin' over
Plus we mack's in the back of the green Nova
I'm labeled sniper, had 'em fallin' fo' they saw the beam
Don't make me strike, and leave 'em hopin' that it was all dream
But nah it ain't, homies been scopin' ya all day
Now what's the outcome from smokin' shawtay?
Seem like death is gettin' in me
I can feel it when the coppers stake out (Can you hear me)
Yeah sometimes, but sometimes I blank out
It's kinda blurry tryina pick ya homies and kick the snakes out
They only wit'cha when ya dishin' the bank out
But fuck that, I'm stayin focused

(Hook, Belo)
God help me out here
Cause I'm off my square
Please show me love, cause they don't care
Peepin' out the po-po through my rear-view
And I can still feel you

God help me out here
Cause I'm off my square
Please show me love, cause they don't care
Peepin' out the po-po through my rear-view
And I can still feel you

(Verse 3, AK)
Release these demons, secretly be kept, and locked inside of me
Hauntin' me for years, and even added to my diary
"Murder was the Case", that left this nigga in an abandoned building
When the Lord come and get me, I'll be ready and willing
Enough with the killin', Lord please, I'm down on my knees
I saw him at ease, it's either or I'm ready to leave
But pick up ya sleeve, you chosen me to carry the weight
I pain and I ate, forgive my sins and open the Gate
I'm knowin' bout fate, you gave me love and all that'cha got
Been blessed with a shot, I took the homie then use a rock
What chances I got? Love sippin' Hen and smokin' on Pot
Put my seed into this world, and I'm tyin' the knot
I'm tyin' the knot

(Verse 4, N.A.R.D.S)
Thug changes, day in, day out
The same game in this
While we keep treatin' eachother like we was strangers
One of my homies from the block, same game in this
Found dead at seventeen, now he's a memory
Hopin' that when it's my time, you'll remember me
Keep yo eyes and closed tight for the cold world
All I can vision is the pain of my old girl
Lookin' down and don't fall in the same line
Fuck ya locked up in the pen for the same crime
I fought the world, for the smaller ones to climb rocks
And when yo daddy dead and gone, don't you ever stop
Hold ya head up high, baby move on
Cause I been fightin' against the world on the same song
Same song, thug changes, day in, day out
The same game in this
While we keep treatin' eachother like we was strangers
One of my homies from the block, same game in this
Same game in this, thug changes, keep ya head up
Stay focused</pre>
