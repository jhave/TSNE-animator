Whattcha know bout them Mississippi Memphis boys, ballin boys?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, one time for them Southern boys
Y'all boys can't mess with us
Y'all boys be stressin us, y'all girls be testin us
While we drive outta town, doin thangs in them Navi' trucks
Got major dough, y'all boys be hatin yo
Tell them boys, roll them D's and lows
Can't stop it yo, cuz the five be hot ya know
Bust shot till ya drop ya know (bah bah bah...)
T nasty, I don't think y'all ducks wanna see me
Cuz it's sweet till ya see P, letcha girl watch while I pee-pee
Drank Henny, smoke trees, have her feelin like ecstasy
I represent for my southern playaz
Hell with all them other playaz
Choked out with my brother playaz
Choke, choke, pass it around - pound for pound
round and round, where'd it get down
H-Town, lay it down, tote big thangs round
One time for the underground
Trees for days, freaks to play, M-I-A
Lay back and switch the days
Still piss on the chick, while the girl kiss on the stick
Southern Hospitality clique, that's real boy
Slow down, ya need ta chill boy, down south we get ill boy
Come on!

[Verse 2]
Whattcha know about box Chevys, Yukons, mirror-tint
Infinitis on platinum D's?
Cadillac Escalades, Navigates, Cherokees on triple D's?
The realest G's, gold teeth, lots of money, lots of trees, Miami
Whattcha know about strip clubs, Rolex, CoCo's...
Whattcha know about 3rd Ward, how it kept a playa hard
and they'll pull ya card, take ya life in a minute?
Dig ya grave, drop you then put you in it
Whattcha know about buyin yoke, cuttin yoke
Settin shop, then sellin yoke
The Dirty South, gats all in yo mouth, walk you in yo house
Lay ya rump down, give that money up, we don't give a what
The realest playaz, if y'all gon' get us, yo girl's my girl playa
Let them know girl, play this game for days, M-I-A today
Candy toys, soulja boys got gats that's hot and burn boy!
