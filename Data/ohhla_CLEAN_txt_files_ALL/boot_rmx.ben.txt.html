[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I bet cutie wanna freak
Don't matter if she on covers of Maxim or Jet "Beauty of the Week"
Give 'em wet cooties when I speak
I usually flash thousands worth of invisbly set jew-ies on a freak
It's likely I'm a take boo in the cut
Take her back to Spike Lee &amp; have her doin' the butt, and I'm a mention
Just the way you shake it make my little soldier stand at attention
My hands gon' be inchin', cause I'm standin' there flinchin'
Tryin' to hold my hand back from pinchin'
But, ma I can't follow too long
Unless you look like a model who on, and swallow boo bons
I'm the kid in the XL Model Yukon
That get more numbers than a lotto coupon
Yo, F-A-B go scanty
Ma, you know how many I meet with no panties?

Boottee (*5 Times*)
I see boottee, I see boottee

[Verse 2: Benzino]
Benzino, if you can't stand the heat get the fuck out the kitchen 
Chauffer driven limousines straight outta prison
In jewelery, man listen
Masterpiece was out to long I never wore presidentials
Still payin' for the shit Jacob lent you (Bootee)
Still waitin' for the check the label sent you (Bootee)
I'm still doin' things you can't imagine (Bootee)
That's there for blastin'
Bangin' on wax that's bootee 
Face it Teddy banged tracks
Zino lace it
I like the chicks with the big fat ones
When you back that ass up all you feel is my gun
Hourglass ass you a mo'fucker boo
So please believe it I'm leavin' with you
&amp; if you want 3 I'm freakin' with you
Benzino smashed bootee more than a few
Ha, ha ha

Bootee (*4 Times*)
I see boottee, I see boottee

[Verse 3: G-Dep]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Aiyyo 8 classes, champagne glasses
V.I.P. passes lettin in all the asses
Got move fastest, cheek to cheek
Move from freak to freak, speak the greek
Shorty with the sleek physique, lots of stylin
The way you move I can tell you got some talent
Intelligent &amp; she fuckin' with seniors
I need brains &amp; you probably a genius
Bein' the Bad Boy you know I be
It's all ages you ain't gotta show ID
Too young as a man in China
So what if she can buy a gray goose with a loose vagina
Forget Azure's, I'll take her to court
Catch me on the dance floor tailgatin' a broad 
I don't care is she ain't a cutie, ask fruity
When I see boottee, I see boottee

Bootee (*4 Times*)

I see boottee, I see boottee

[Outro]
Aiyyo my party people dance to this (boottee, boottee)
Party people dance to this (Feel me, feel me) 

Repeat 3.5 Times
