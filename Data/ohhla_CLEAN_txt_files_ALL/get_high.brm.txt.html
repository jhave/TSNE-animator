Verse 1:

Before I set it off and show what I'm gonna do to ya
Possess the bomb chocolate from off Lynden and Utica
My real live niggas in the place and no queen
Wave your splif high son
Fuck the bullshit
When your arms are open
My palms release the bomb 
Reviving the alarm
My word is bond
Scream at niggas through the intercom
Up to date, let's roller skate
Yo my whole squad smoking aint straight unless we smoking at eight
High rate, I always produce the potion
Weed smoking got me moving slow motion like we floatin on relax ocean
All my peeps who feel high
Dont want you darkin shades, there's to much smoke up in your eye
Keep it swingin listen to all of my bells ringin
My get high has niggas wantin to start singin
And this goes out to those that smoke out the bong
And all my bitches in the place who roll they own draws

Chorus: repeat 2X

Buy a nickel bag
Smoke a little lye
Get high tonight
Get high tonight

Verse 2:

Yo, bounce back you just caught the contact african black overreact
Charge
I'm bout to bench the whole wack must interact on every track
Blow this spot down niggas break fool and smoke across the world almanac
My sons that don't smoke and get high 
drinkin Cognac, Hennesey, Cristal but wait
What's goin on with dat?
With the deal done sometimes I sip Jamaican white rum 
Taste with a little milk, I know y'all niggas want some
Represent where you from needing some tic tacs and gum 
So a nigga breath don't blahhh!!!
Get high, then i get fly
When i be shopping at the atrium 
Smoking in the center of Yankee stadium
Stand strong, yes we rock on and on
The Flipmode stamps all of my songs
They get a place them niggas must perfrom
Smoke till your brain fry
So high you can't open your eye 
My niggas need to just

Chorus 5X</pre>
