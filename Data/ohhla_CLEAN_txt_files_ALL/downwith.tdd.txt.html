[Intro]
From the South to the bottom
It's the brand new Trick
(M.I.A., down South, yo yo College Park)
And if you never been down South before
We bout to show y'al how we ridin' (Get up, get up)
(Let's...let's go)

[Hook]
Be like down South show a lil' change
For the girls in the club that be shakin' that thang
And got the young players comin' up, wanna run thangs
Y'all see them girls when they in them g-strangs
Now everybody wanna be down wit da South
(Now everybody wanna be down wit da South)
Now everybody tryin' to get down wit da South
(Now everybody tryin' to get down wit da South)
Cause in the club (In the club)
All them girls that be shakin' in the club
In da club (In the club)
All the thugs they be playin' in the club (Ooooh)

[Trick Daddy]
Yo, I'm from the state where the sun shine
Where the women are pretty and they so fine
Where the dudes are rude but they so cool
Listen good weather is better for a good fella
And every ride will probably be on twenty-two's or twenty-four's on T-0's
And you know like I know, we gon' represent it everywhere we go
And every time we drop hits
For hittin' everything we spit it gots to be the shit
So give me a fresh white tee
A pair of Preist jeans and some j's yall never seen
an I can't help but win on heavy rotation
On all of your stations
Down South takin' over all of the charts
We just got started and will not stop

[Hook]

[Trina]
You ain't never seen a big ol' ass like this
And you ain't never gon' run across a badder bitch
I'm Ms. Trina, Miami's finest
And you can ask your man who has the flyest
Players who millionaires try to buy this
And I ain't got shit to hide
I like to squat and ride
Go front and back, side to side
Bend me over show me what you holdin'
And oh shit, now give it to me, give me that big ol' dick
First suck me up, and then buck me up
Go deeper, deeper, beat me, beat me
Let's make a sequel for the naked people
Your whole click against my click
Now shake that ass, shake that ass
Shake that ass and make your baby daddy mad

[Hook]

[Kaine]
Here we come to fuck the whole floor
Ying Yang Twins kickin' in your door
Scat like a rat when a cat comin' out the house
Dirty South

[D-Roc]
y bad, we done did it again
Trick Daddy and the Ying Yang Twins
If you don't know, Let me fill you in
I hope you know we in it to win
You didn't know we the super friends
We done did another song again
So I just know it's on again
We gonna put a joint to win
Y'all gonna get rolled over like a bulldozer
I hope you know the game over
Dade County the fullest county
We still run these got damn streets
I don't think I'ma change
In ten years I'ma be doin' the same damn thang

[Kaine]
Nigga fuck hoes
Nigga do shows
Nigga get in trouble, uh oh
Will I smoke if it ain't dro
Hell no player so fuck no

[Hook]

[Trina]
Now shake that ass, shake that ass
Shake that ass and make your baby daddy mad
Now shake that ass, shake that ass
Shake that ass and make your baby daddy mad
Now shake that ass and make your baby daddy mad
Shake that ass and make your baby daddy mad
Now shake that ass and make your baby daddy mad
Shake that ass and make your baby daddy mad</pre>
