[Intro: Redman (Method Man)]
Straight up, nigga
Brick City on fire, nigga
We on fire, nigga
(Beast shit) yeah
(Oh yeah, my mic sound real nice, check it)
(Yeah, uh, ok) yessir
Hot off the press, yo, yo

[Redman]
Check out the, main attraction, black man in action
The orangutan that remain a captain
You need a boost, I'm the right thing to tap in
Cuz hip hop is lame, the whole game is lacking
I make my commission off, weed and shows
Chicks wanna spread rumors like Club New Vogue
But I pimp it like my ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff, we don't love them hoes
Each flow that I'm spitting sound mall nutrition
But it's phat when the clip in, boy, I mean business
We got beef for the teeth, with soy bean niggas
Redman &amp; Method Man, stay in the lab
America meet the new Tango &amp; Cash
Hip hop is in trouble, I stay on the pad
Rappers wanna feature me, I'm like give me a math
I'm like "nah", I'mma keep it funky, nigga
Talk 20, cuz for money, I"m a junkie nigga

[Chorus: Method Man (Redman)]
I'm dope, nigga (yeah, that's what the say)
(Frank Lucas with the pen, get at me, ok?)
I'm dope, nigga, dirty needle stuck in the arm
Hustle til the package is gone, never tuck in my charm, cuz I'm
I'm dope, nigga (now I'm out to my dope)
(Nino Brown takeover, that's how I roll)
Now let me smoke witcha, hard when the kid on the job
Keep a step ahead of the law, push the peddle and floor

[Method Man]
I got that small change, my nigga, quarters, nickels &amp; dimes
I might cop a little shine, favorite pistol, a nine
I can't deal with fickle minds cuz I'm too official with mine
Put your nose in my notebook and go and sniff you a line
I'm dope, nigga, I'm heroin in it's prime
While the game is on it's decline, bitches on my define
I fine rhyme and easy, but I ain't easy to find
Number one on my to do list, please believe me, it's crime
Ain't with the tom foolery, Meth, if you don't know that
I'mma bet on what to do with me, yet, go 'head and Google me
Your boy flow fluently, yes, still got that Wu in me
Screw it, let me do it to death, minus the eulogy
Ah-hah, I'm ahead of the game, ahead of these lames
I'm a head case, the head nurse is getting better with brain
Let me network, the rest of you niggas stay in your lane
Know your network, now back to the script, like I was saying

[Chorus]

[Redman]
The hip hop Yogi Berra, New York, let's get together
It took a '90's boy, to flow in your era
Niggas never saw me when I write, and signed in a letter
I was born the son of Helen Keller
My skin is Old Yeller, but a bitch dig a fella
She like the way car wheels flip the propellers
I 'stay fly' like Three 6, someone tell her
Doc &amp; Meth tough like Run-DMC leather

[Method Man]
I'm the 'king of rock', dimes, grams and ki's
Cuz the world don't give a fuck if I got a fam to feed
This a heroin dream, smash up a fiend
You can see this pack in my jeans, put you back on your lean
Yeah, back for a fit, back on my shit
Got my ex from back in the days, even back on my dick
This is crack shit, ya'll do it big, I super size
Coke Classic, my nose in the 'cane, like Super Fly, cuz I'm

[Chorus]</pre>
