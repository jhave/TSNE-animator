[Nas Escobar]
Yo whassup man this is Nas in yo' motherfuckin ear
Knahmsayin, I be chillin 'round with the Alkaholik niggaz man
Knahmsayin, them niggaz gettin drinks yo
I be like, yo y'all I drink the Henessey shit
Mix it with the champagne, shit like that
See I smokes too though, but when I drinks
Me and my niggaz sometime we get that, what's that shit
That Tequila shit, put some salt on your hand
suck a lemon and drink some a fuckin shot of Tequila and I zone
