Lets take it back to the old school

Ah yeah
Here we go
As I flow
To this slow tempo
And go off
To make her dance
So get out your seat
'Cause this is your last chance
To rock on a song that's hype like this
'Cause can't nobody else write like this
Or rock the ill on the mic like this
Or make a dope beat that's tight like this
Or come with the funk that pumps
In the bass that drops
To get the crowd pump
And make you jump up out yo seat
And hump to the double to shot DB
So ladies drop to the sound get down
Grubs in Miami up to the A town
Just work that thing girl
Please don't ruin it
Please don't stop
Do it, do it</pre>
