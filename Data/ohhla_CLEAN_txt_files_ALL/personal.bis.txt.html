[Chorus] [Vanessa Marquez] [x2]
I can be your personal chauffeur
Call me up and I'll drive right over
And pick you up
For your funeral

[Verse One]
I wonder, wander, ponder, fonder
Read epiphanies entities killin' my enemies
Violently, silently, neatly, quietly
Or out in the open for all who have eyes to see
Your murder
You're leaving
Hating profusely til no pulse or breathing
That's why I don't beef with no rappers
I just send Angels &amp; Demons to clap ya
So I minx you here then worse in the after
Send you to Hell
Dante's Inferno
Seven levels to dwell eternal
These pages here are ripped from his journal
Beef up security
More guns to carry
I'll still be right there just like in Hail Mary
Preparing your bed
With shovels to bury

[Chorus] [Vanessa Marquez] [x2]
I can be your personal chauffeur
Call me up and I'll drive right over
And pick you up
For your funeral

[Verse Two]
With men writing, then light, my pen write like M. Night
Rappers too scared to sleep
Stay up all night
Just kill yourself
Please, you'll be alright
Just face your gun, squeeze, you'll see the light
Refuse to, I use some Jew Juice
Same suicide scene
M.O., the usual
Don't fuck with the new crypt keeper
Cause on speed dial I keep the grim reaper
I push the phantoms, no not the ride
The kind that float and dart in the sky
The kind that find anywhere you can hide
Make you see things
The dead come alive
Make you fly off the freeway, your family inside
Trapped, burned alive
Witness your ending
Now open your eyes
Death is the beginning

[Chorus] [Vanessa Marquez] [x2]
I can be your personal chauffeur
Call me up and I'll drive right over
And pick you up
For your funeral

[Outro]
That's some real shit man. That's Vanessa know what I'm sayin'? 
Doin' her thing, Khalil on the beat. Let's get onto the next shit man</pre>
