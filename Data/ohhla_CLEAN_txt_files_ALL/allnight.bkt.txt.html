Listen
Shit just aint the same
When you slide through (Whoa)
I get distracted every time you in my view (Yeah)
Plus I hear you kinda single right now boo (True)
And I got a perfect spot for a tattoo (Oh)
I get ya name more than once if I have to (Yeah)
Me and you up at a classic then buy you
Cause I got a few places you can fly to
Bring ya partners cause you know I'm bringin' my crew
(Yeah)

[Brian McKnight]
Girl don't you walk on by
We're not leavin' one more time
Shorty's got her back to me
Show me what you got for me
Watch you move from side to side
Lick your lips then close your eyes
Like something from a fantasy
Good for you and good for me girl

So we can talk about the things you want (Talk about the things want)
Or we can talk about the things you like
Girl I don't just talk to hear my lines
You've heard it all a thousand times girl
And we can talk about taking it slow (Takin' it slow)
And we can talk about taking our time
Girl how can I get you in my ride
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Baby let me love you (Baby let me love you)
All night long (All night long)
All night long (All night long)
Baby let me please you (Let me please you, yeah)
All night long (All night long)
All night long (Mmm hmmm)

We can take a ride in my ride
We can get it on outside
Hit it of like 1-2-3
The moon and stars is all we need
Then we can take it back to my crib
We don't have to say that we did
No one knows that we just met
What you see is what you get

So we can talk about the things you want (Talk about the things want)
Or we can talk about the things you like
Girl I don't just talk to hear my lines
You've heard it all a thousand times girl
And we can talk about taking it slow (Takin' it slow)
And we can talk about taking our time
Girl how can I get you in my ride
Who's gonna drive you home tonight

Baby let me love you (Baby let me love you)
All night long (All night long)
All night long (All night long, yeah yeah)
Baby let me please you (Let me please you)
All night long (All night long)
All night long

Oh baby whenever you say
We can be out
I'm not in a hurry Ma
But we can go now
There's so many ways
We can get down
I'm gonna give all the lovin' to ya
Oh girl

[Nelly]
I wanna be your stability
Physically finance and mentally
If willing
I'll be fulfilling anything you reveal to me
Like ya fantasies
Ya dreams
Peaches and cream
You name it
You pick
I lick
That's the thing
Time don't mean a damn thing in this case
So unplug the clocks
And close the drapes
I got it all planned out
Me and you goin'
Until we both scream ouch
We both pass out

So we can talk about the things you want (Talk about the things want)
Or we can talk about the things you like
Girl I don't just talk to hear my lines
You've heard it all a thousand times girl
And we can talk about taking it slow (Takin' it slow)
And we can talk about taking our time
Girl how can I get you in my ride
Who's gonna take you home tonight

Baby let me love you (Baby let me love you)
All night long (All night long)
All night long (All night long, yeah yeah)
Baby let me please you (Let me please you)
All night long (All night long)
All night long

Baby let me love you (We can be out)
All night long (Hurry Ma, but we can go now)
All night long
Baby let me please you (We can get down)
All night long
All night long</pre>
