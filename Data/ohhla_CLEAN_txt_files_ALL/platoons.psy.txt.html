CHORUS (x1)
Time is short and my life is sick 
That's how it is man look at this shit 
You get abused by street platoons 
Hit you like wind and what-cha gonna do? 
We break circles of enemies blocks get shot with defeat 
They say no drive-by's on the street 
So mutha-fuckas run rival sweeps 
  
Sick platoons flood the streets of Los 
Like a sick typhoon 
Mutha-fuckas drive by world wide 
And everybody you and I know dies 
The only guarantee in life is death your last breath 
Come when your famo least expect it 
Soldier run wild in your song 
Red dawn strikes your back in dead 'nam 
Your mind's flipping but the scene's dead calm 
And your whole world's thrown and wrapped in psyclone 
Alright ride through the city like that 
Pants, T-shirts are creased and stole gats 
LA undercover shoot to kill 
Child of the streets run wild in war fields 
Scheming on pigs that start shit 
Guilty treat us all dirty filthy 
  
The streets are flooded with budded corrupted minds running 
Those who can't cut it 
Leave the hoodlum studded ghetto wondering what is 
The excuse or reason for high treason 
In blasting season leaving one of your color bleeding 
Repeating never stopping body dropping 
'Hood rocking window glocking zone shocking 
Defending pavement attacking, facing arraignment 
Jail's enslavement shackled for justice to the plaintiff 
When the charges stick that's it you get hit with some bid 
For what you did prevent and rid some kid of his chance to live 
'Cause of the block he lives in 
Not giving a fuck just trying to win your block ribbon 
Glock driven joining street platoons like it's some fashion 
Going out of style so you catch it for some action 
It's no joke homeboys get smoked, poked, 'cause they provoke 
Locked on dope no hope for growth that's why we're broke 
Short pocket street criminals fail to lock it but crime sky rockets 
So where the fuck is the profit? 
Maybe in hands of those who supply drugs and weapons 
Let's take that shit back by forming neighborhood connections 
  
CHORUS (x1)
