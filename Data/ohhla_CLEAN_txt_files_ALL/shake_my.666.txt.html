Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I've come to shake my ass
I've come to shake my ass
(Three 6 Mafia)
I've come to shake my ass
I've come to hypnotize my ass

I've come to shake my ass
Need anythin', I'm gonna give it real
Just wanna shake my ass
Mean when I drink cuz I'm onto you
So can I shake my ass?
Meanwhile I shakin' make 'em sing, sing
With the bang, with the bomb, with the bomb

Yeah, a bomb in the club
Fresh off of the crash
Freshen up tail like an old mouse trap
Tell me what it is, how the 88 sound
I'm gonna take you to my crib for a lil' night cap

But then the slap, ghetto clown
Tap, tap, tap to the pretty little gal
Pump and burn to Knicca
Pump and burn to Knicca

Take a little break to hit me, hit me back
Go unless you make it now
Body moving like, there she go
Make me snap, already get me hard
Like high school jock straps

Let's recap
There's nobody 'ro those cute little shorts
If there's that love
If you ain't no tither, you better get drugged
Party shots, like wat, wat?

I've come to shake my ass
Need anythin', I'm gonna give it real
Just wanna shake my ass
Mean when I drink cuz I'm onto you
So can I shake my ass?
Meanwhile I shakin' make 'em sing, sing
With the bang, with the bomb, with the bomb

Once again in the booty club
Trying to get some love
Imma do what I gotta do, Imma be a bum
Wanna touch, even wanna cut
Down there like a butt
Black and white, mixed like a mutt
Imma frustrate

Imma pimp walking with a limp
Got her to a pinch in my pants
I've got her in a clip held by a chimp
I'm the man when it come to this
So an artist made her hips, it'd make her flip

I prefer a lift of my chopsticks
Oh stop it
Let the dancer take money outta your pocket
She can move it and drop it
With her clothes on, it makes her topless

She a hot girl in her own world
On the spot, girl
Body tease, body all grease like a S curl
My dizzies get my face made kinda sleazy
Pop it, shake that thang girl, please me

I've come to shake my ass
Need anythin', I'm gonna give it real
Just wanna shake my ass
Mean when I drink cuz I'm onto you
So can I shake my ass?
Meanwhile I shakin' make 'em sing, sing
With the bang, with the bomb, with the bomb

I'm a real role figure, lemme tell you what I think
I like women, I like steaks
I like cars with the candy paint
And an iced out booty with an iced out make

I like girls with their goodie-good-good
Woodpeckers peckin' on the woodie-wood-wood
She love a go on the hoodie-hood-hood
Takin' the whole thing like I knew she could

Pimp who?
Baby, you sexy, scratch my back
Bite my lips, just like that
Baby, you sexy, scratch my back
Bite my lips, just like that

I've come to shake my ass
Need anythin', I'm gonna give it real
Just wanna shake my ass
Mean when I drink cuz I'm onto you
So can I shake my ass?
Meanwhile I shakin' make 'em sing, sing
With the bass, with the bomb, with the bomb

On the floor, in the rave
With the bomb, with the bomb
On the floor in the pocket with the bass, drum
Over here, I do my business like I'm dumb, dumb
I'm the boom with the bang, with the bomb, with the bomb</pre>
