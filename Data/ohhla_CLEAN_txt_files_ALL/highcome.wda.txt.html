High
Come down

(Verse 1)
[Coolwadda] Hit the coast with a sudden impact
            Royals in the eight-pack, zip in the zip-pack
            Heat packed for the whole trip
            {*Niggas*} don't emcee
            They just say they do until I spit
            {*Shit*}
            Get lifted with blunts, snap once
            Pssh
            Limit the bounce like bad bungee jumps
            Parallel, on the hunt for the chips
            Flash
[Chico]     Take a walk with it, pointed on ya hip
[Coolwadda] {*Fuck*} it though, that's me
            Who is you?
            I'm down with Dirty Jerks, and R.C. and A.P.
            But who is you?
            Juan, simple vetta to the rest
            {*Niggas*} seem to have a vendetta on the West
            Serve you Ghost Rider cause you not versin'
            The Scouting Report
            Says, "Hot person"
            So watch who you {*fuckin'*} with
            You {*fuckin'*} up my high, little {*bitch*}

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Chico]
You can't explain this
Cause I'm a carry out my due
Chico hood's the chipper
Chip with chrome buster
Ugh
For pickin' up the phone
Well, I used to {*fuck*} that {*hoe*}
But now
{*Fuck*} that {*hoe*}
Like I want her back
{*Nigga*}
{*Fuck*} that {*hoe*}
See me in the breeze
Underneath the palm trees
Holla at you now, please, spit it from the throat
This west side neighborhood, I'm a low
Now A.P., if you ever need some get back
Call me
I'll make sure it get back
Catch a flight
Pssh
Catch 'em in the night
Parallel double barrels
{*Fuckin'*} right
In fact, the impact gon' be sudden
Five times, bloke
All through his buttons
Please believe
Said trip you'll receive
A exit out this universe
On me

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Chico]
My Bible wouldn't been preached
Been the beast, I been the prey
Parallel park in here
And get towed away
Stowed away
In the back of the trunk where the tool be
Fools be actin' like I won't bust this uzi
Cool, he proves me
Over yonder
In that little white
Honda, Civic, they thought that street {*shit*}
Well then, I can get to livin'
Let me out here
Pivot post
I'm chippin' in {*shit niggas*} up close

[Coolwadda]
I bust the uzi so you can bust one
Must've brought your high
Down, to get you on one, Chico
So you know I'm on one
And when they scatter and run
Hop out the cut with the pump shotgun
Just in case
I got to come on y'all like eight minutes
Ride for the chips, parallel
Til we finish
Rearrange rap with the rare raw flow
Not feelin' y'all, bringin' down my hydro

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Nate Dogg
Just hit the eastside
Of the {*fuckin'*} L.B.C.
I don't associate with haters
How mother{*fuckin'*} gangstas be
Just hit the dope
Spot
Just picked up some bomb ass {*weed*}
Man, I'll holla at you later
I'm about to hit these streets
As sure as my game is tight
Just spotted a real dame piece
I thought my day could not be greater
That's about the time I peeped
There go Mr. John N. Law
All in my rear view
The next thing I heard was sirens
Tell me, what am I to do?
