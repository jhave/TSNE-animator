Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Uh, shiit
Meet me at the top floor
Too hot; so I high roll
Tell 'em you for Kirko when you pull up at the condo
Super bad; she super fine
She super mine, and she super dope
Super man; I save the day
I save the night and I give her hope
Call her up when I wanna fuck
Red bull and I hit the dope
Tell my friend to go pick her up
From the lobby don't get too close
If your friend says she wanna fuck
Then you know we gonna flip them hoes
If say she don't wanna fuck
Give me a minute and I'm a fix it ho
Simple nigga, instrumental killa
Bout' to make a movie; I'm Ben Stiller
Skin Vanilla, Hey deala
My dope nuts like Jade Dada
She hit the sweet then she hit the drink
Then she was giving it up in eight minutes
I hit the sweet then hit the drink
Then I was writing my name in it

[Chorus]
Meet me at the top floor [4X]
I'll be waiting [3X]
Yeah
I'll be waiting [3X]
Yeah
Meet me at the top floor [4X]
I'll be waiting [3X]
Yeah
I'll be waiting [3X]
Yeah

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
2 Chaiiiinz
I'm on the top floor
Presidential suite
Monica Lewinsky; presidential freak
Look at my rolley; presidential piece
And I got connects like two swisher sweets
I am getting to the money you should join a nigga
If your baby daddy hatin; you should warn a nigga
Yeah that bitch bad tell her phone a nigga
She dark skin but she brought a yellow bone with her
2 chainz yeah they fuckin with my ad libs (2 chainz)
My garage, is bigger than your damn crib
Top off, dip the swag in hot sauce
Hit the elevator, headed to the top floor

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
Meet me at the top floor
Super high so my eyes low
I don't smoke that much, but shit
Tonight I'm up on that Hydro
Posted like a black crow
Posted up on a scare crow
Little nigga, I don't king shit
And she thinking I'm a pharaoh
Call her up to my hotel, Bone her up, marrow
Hit that shit tonight and I'll be hitting till tomorraw
Beating it while she singing, yeah, call that a collabo
I'm her favorite rider, call me a Camaro
One deep that's me but I'm hoping she isn't that shallow
Three deep bring two freaks that will do me in the bathroom
Young B-A-N-G is on point like arrow
Meet me at the top floor while I'm counting cash flow

[Chorus]

We on the top floor waiting on you niggaz! Haaa!</pre>
