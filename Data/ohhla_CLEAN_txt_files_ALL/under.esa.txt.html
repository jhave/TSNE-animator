[Esau]
All these kids today screaming underground, do they know what it means
To make 7 albums, work everyday and go hungry just to chase your dreams
To be #1 in Gavin, CMJ, Impact and BRE
Then have to beg a promoter to open up for Run-D.M.C.
Nah, I don't think so, my shit's fat too, so is his
But is there room for all of us in the shady rap biz
Put your 12's out yourself, push it, beg the pd
to play it and chart it, then maybe some kids will hear of you in NYC
Or LA, or college in Tennessee or maybe it'll reach overseas
To Italy and maybe even to the heads in the military
If you're lucky, you're website will get 10 hits a day
and Pizzo will sell your stuff online the hiphopsite.com way
Even them cats at footwork will rock it or play da record in t dot
Mr Bongo in London or all the HMV's in Oz
But until then keep posting up at Davy D and rhyming over others beats
Until you get the knowledge kid, you won't know what underground means

HOOK

You ain't underground cause you're white, or just cause you're black
You ain't underground cause you recorded your album on a 4 track
You ain't underground cause your beats are wack, or even if they're fat
You ain't underground simply cause your shit is abstract
You ain't underground cause you don't cypher, 
you ain't underground cause you do
You ain't underground cause you can freestyle and roll with a tight crew
You ain't underground with no airplay
You ain't underground with MTV play
You ain't underground cause 4 kids bump your shit out in Tampa Bay
You ain't underground cause you don't buy mixtapes
You ain't underground cause you do
You ain't underground cause you own every tape by Touch and Clue
You ain't underground cause you're on the net
You ain't underground when you dub cassettes
You ain't underground cause you buy vinyl to rock on your 1200 set
You ain't underground cause you post lyrics
You ain't underground cause you dis them
You ain't underground cause you hate EPMD or even if you missed them
You ain't underground cause you're unknown
You ain't underground if you're unsigned
You ain't underground cause you analyze lyrics in Company Flow rhymes
You ain't underground cause you like Sugarhill
You ain't underground cause you keep it real
You ain't underground cause you do or do not deal
You ain't underground cause you use big words
You ain't underground if you don't curse
You ain't underground cause you get creative with your adverbs
You ain't underground cause you use metaphors, or if you bore
You ain't underground cause you don't have product in any major stores
You ain't underground, yeah I said it
You ain't underground, don't forget it
You ain't underground because your wack ass CD ain't selling
