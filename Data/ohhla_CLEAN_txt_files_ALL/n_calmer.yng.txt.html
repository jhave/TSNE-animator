(Kaine)
The nerve calmer
The nerve calmer
The nerve calmer
The nerve calmer
The nerve calmer

(D Roc) [Kaine]
I'm kinda antsy in my mothafuckin pants
The average bro might not understand, bitch I'm a man (Man!)
And I mean it from the heart
I just hate it when you make your lips part
All you do is [nag, nag, nag]
Make a nigga [mad, mad, mad]
Gotta smoke me a [bag, bag, bag]
To keep from kickin yo' [ass, ass, ass]

(Hook)
I need mo' weed
Just to smoke, so I can calm my nerves
Say I need, mo' weed
Just to smoke, so I can calm my nerves
Yaeey!

(Kaine)
The nerve calmer
The nerve calmer
The nerve calmer
The nerve calmer
The nerve calmer
Yup!</pre>
