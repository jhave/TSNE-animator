We got the hook-up

[Chorus]

Who rock this bitch

Who run this bitch

That No Limit click
That Wu-Tang click
That No Limit click
That Wu-Tang click

[Ol'Dirty Bastard]

Yo, yo, yo I demolish emcees in the south go south
Sound few projects that really don't doubt
Well as I remember I was 12 years old
Didn't know about fronting or playing a role
Yo thought I was slick, felt harder than bricks
With my Mr. duh and my uptown kicks

[Mystikal]

Its my time to come in this bitch and put my foot down
I'm getting ready to fitting knock your mothafucking door down
Cause when Ol Dirty Bastard doing something you know its bout to go down
All them motherfuckers that didn't know I bet they know now
Bitch you better slow down before you get tore down
The click I roll with, weak niggas can't go round
(Ya'll what)
Nigga we hot bring your ass to the ground
OWWWW, hard to pronounce

[Chous]

Who rock this bitch
We rock this bitch
Who run this bitch
We run this bitch
That No Limit click
That Wu-Tang click
That No Limit click
That Wu-Tang click

[Ol Dirty Bastard]

Watch cha waiting thru your rap fatigues
If the mc world was a minor league
See would niggas cease where it is unique
Tear itzzzz up from an old antique
Don't inspect the project, bet on you frees
Hardhead, startin that said siamese
I never like rhymes that's incomplete
Then again obsolete, shall I repeat
Its an easy street for a nigga who earn
Learn so dern and a nigga return
Add intelligent, positive messenger
Experiment negative Lucifer
I'm intelligent so excellent
Girls wanna talk to me I don't give you know hint
Will I wait a moment give you a compliment
Bitch do you think this is some sort of entertainment
Forget about that, that's just experiment
Damn a nigga blew a fuse off the things I invent
Allow myself, my fresh reducement
Better step to the left of the rap lightning
There's no replacement for my supplement
Of the new testament cause what I say is what I meant

[Chorus]

Who rock this bitch
We rock this bitch
Who run this bitch
We run this bitch
That No Limit click
That Wu-Tang click
That No Limit click
That Wu-Tang click

[Mystikal]

Motherfucker WOO SHIT I'm a stomp you bitch
H-bomb on a nigga cause you can't do this
When I pull up my bitch we all spray, bitch be gone its gone be on
It'll be a motherfucking murderer on this microphone
I ain't gone die no hoe BOY, I'm out the N.O
I'm a 5-0-4 BOY, you a fucking fool
I'M A 5-0-4 BOY, No Limit and WU
I'M ROWDY ON THE FLOOR BOY
Huh nigga what

[Chorus]

Who rock this bitch
We rock this bitch
Who run this bitch
We run this bitch
That No Limit click
That Wu-Tang click
That No Limit click
