DMX:
URRRRRRR
Uh huh
Y'all motherfuckers ready or what?
Is y'all motherfuckers ready or what?
I don't think you are
I don't think so!

They got my back against the building
I'm the villian that's creeping around corners
Like shorty you see them niggas creeping around, warn us
We might be coming through, gunning through, running through
So be careful what you do
Or the slugs might come to you
As long as I can remeber, the streets have kept me safe
And ever since that time in December, the heat's been in my waist
I need an extra set of eyes so I keep my dogs with me
Doctor says let them die said his fucking dog bit me
I don't know whats wrong with me
But it seems like since you heard of us
Y'all niggas turning into murderers
Couldn't fuck with a third of us
Still against me
And wanting to see me in the box
Grilling me all crazy when you see me and the L.O.X.
Leave you Red like Foxx
Ain't nothing funny about that
I see you in a coma, ain't coming up out that
You hold on for too long and they ain't pulling the plug for you
I'll run up in the joint myself and bust another slug on you
It's murda
It's murda motherfuckers

Jay-Z:
I take a squat then post up with the toast up
I bring beef to a closure
Know somethin?
&gt;From cats stackin four-somes
I'm loathesome 
I scream out fuck the world then I throw something
Niggas scheming hard but fuck it, it's the god
I leave bullets lodged leave you leaning on your broad
And our punks leave you gagged up in your car
Slumping Kennedy-style with your memory out
What the fuck y'all want?
Daddio with the calico 
Let the gaty blow leave you bleeding on your patio
I leave rivals on their backs looking up at the sky blue
Not only do I leave you I hide you
I before you
X and Ja-Rule
Death before dishonor now and prior to
Boss man spy on you
Conspire you
Me die before you?
You liar, you
Niggas is dead off the hits I approve
Fuck it, I got the feds wearin wired suits
Y'all niggas don't listen
Whether in streets or in prison
When we find them we twist them
They fucking up missing
Y'all don't understand we want y'all all to hate it
It's murda
Murder incorporated
It's murda
In crime we all related
It's murda
See if y'all can take it

Ja-Rule:
I'ma murderer and murdering anything that moves
Through ya nine niggas
Straight do or die niggas
Caught up and fall victim to the worst shit
X, Jigga, and Ja as expected
Shot on the world and reflect it
Niggas don't respect it
So get it the worst way
Fuck with the wolves you get hunted like prey
Shot up in broad day
Now everybody want you
I'm feeling like: stupid didn't the inc. warn you the first time
It's murda
Whenever you see blood
It's murda
Lay you down for the love
That's us 
Leave the lights on
Knife through your windpipe
Cause most of your niggas ain't cut right
You thinking it's alright 
But it ain't
I'm paralyzing clowns up and down from the waist
Giving niggas facelifts and taking it
While making you bleed
And if I got a taste of the shit I'm taking more than you need
It's nothing but love between me, you, and these slugs
Hit him up wrap his body up in a area rug
Who holding the heat?
Who leaving niggas cold in the street?
Y'all know me, ya Co-D, Ja-Rule the O.G.
Niggas better watch me closely
Get a grip, it's hennessy that fuels all that murderin' shit
When I look in the mirror my reflection is killer
Jigga, X, Ja niggas 
It's murda
