Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
They say the road hot, I'm still road runnin
I told my plug fuck it, I'm a keep it goin
They say the road hot, I'm still road runnin
I told my plug fuck it, I'm a keep it goin

[Bridge]
You tripped and left yo money on the highway
I gotta thank God for making spress way
Caught a ticket, put it on the road every day
The road ain't hot, I drive it my way

[Verse 1]
I'm gon start that road runnin, juggin for this cash money
Every time I put em on the road I may go toss the money
Young Scooter always blow them racks, I got that actor money
Roadrunner rappin 1 time and never leave a odor
Ridin past the state trooper, I'm just dope boy patrolin
Whiter tan plus I got em cheeks just like Mexican
100 thousand, get yo seven on, remix that for them
Bring them bricks to yo city, nigga you know what it is
I know I'm facing time, my daughter needs some Pampers
My son 6 years old, already like to gamble
Every day I'm in the streets, nigga taking chances
Them all white bricks, run up whole clear view

[Chorus]
They say the road hot, I'm still road runnin
I told my plug fuck it, I'm a keep it goin
They say the road hot, I'm still road runnin
I told my plug fuck it, I'm a keep it goin

[Bridge]
You tripped and left yo money on the highway
I gotta thank God for making spress way
Caught a ticket, put it on the road every day
The road ain't hot, I drive it my way

[Verse 2]
60 grand, fuck break up boy
Half a million I'll take a charge
Drug dealer for no movie, ah we'll go to jail before we start
Love strong around the blow, make you catch a contact
That's why nigga live in Mexico, we'll bag ya out ya country
Bust yo head and hit the road
Throwin bands on the interstate
Give me coke, I make it grow, roll it off the interstate
Talkin my daddy fuck it, I need mo food on the diner plate
My brother up the road, he got no zooish, you know that's off the gate
First I got my money up
Then bulletproof my Hummer truck
Get around and switched the license places, shooters come light you up
I started from a four and a half pound brick
Hold it with that cocaine, roadrunner in that dope game

[Chorus]
They say the road hot, I'm still road runnin
I told my plug fuck it, I'm a keep it goin
They say the road hot, I'm still road runnin
I told my plug fuck it, I'm a keep it goin

[Bridge]
You tripped and left yo money on the highway
I gotta thank God for making spress way
Caught a ticket, put it on the road every day
The road ain't hot, I drive it my way</pre>
