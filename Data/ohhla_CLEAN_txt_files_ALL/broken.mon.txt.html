"A broken heart"

Her apartment was wallpapered in 2Pac posters
She used playing cards as coasters
Rusted pipe cockroaches
Voted most likely to succeed
They was right all she do now is suck-seeds
Clutch-clit, suck-dick while she puff weed
In the bathroom, bandaids for her scuffed knees
With her hand chop a mountain down, you know where her nose at
Running where them hookers and them hoes at
Before the Paxil and the Prozac
She used to beg a nigger for the bozac
Now all I ever hear is where the doughs at?
The prada bags, Clothes at
Took my heart, froze that
Promised that if I opened it up it would never close back
It was a love so solid
Plans to deliver the ring like Frodo the Hobbit
But you cut me off like Lorena Bobbit
on some bullshit, when we was just getting started
And I can see it inside your face I'm in your space
right people just need to move at they're on pace
But my advantage is, Seven spiritual laws and anger management
Seven spiritual laws and anger management
Seven spiritual laws and
"A broken heart"

I saw you at the knicks game
Damn you look good now
Your new man is a bitch though
Shoulda seen the way he switch-yo
From my head I might remove this gun
Live my life to the fullest have fun
Some Dr. Atkin shit no fun's cause
99 problems and a bitch ain't one
Streets of new york walk into the sun
On some Martin-luther King we shall overcome
Dismantling biz, he's back on his grizz
Dismantling stress, he's handling his
Plans for some attords? and for various projects
I'm so focused now I can see through objects
Show how I can make some positive progress
Time is now, Oh so obvious
