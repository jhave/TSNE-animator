Crackin' niggas jaws
Runnin hoes into walls
Niggas yellin "North North!"
Hoes screamin "North North!"

[Project Pat]
On the north side of town (North North!)
Lurk the killers and the thugs (North North!)
Those who never show no pity (North North!)
Come up short, feel the slugs (North North!) 
Upper tone to ya dome (North North!)
When it's over then that's it (North North!)
Ain't gon' be no comin' back (North North!)
You's a victim of this shit (North North!)
Heard the clique (North North!)
Then the gun blast (North North!) 
Then yo' body fall (North North!)
In a hood (North North!)
Where this gang shit wrote all on the wall (North North!)
You can call who you want (North North!)
But the police ain't gon' come (North North!)
Till the killers leave the scene (North North!)
And the shit's already done (North North!)
Any one of you lames dumpin stolars to yo' fo (North North!)
If it's anna on yo' chest, I'ma bring it to yo' do' (North North!)
Heidy ho, like I'm ?? (North North!)
Like I'm Lone Ranger (North North!)
Hollows in the chamber (North North!)
Now yo' life's in danger (North North!)
Project not a stranger (North North!)
To dra-ma-ci-dal life (North North!)
Get yo' ass blowed (North North!)
Off in front-of-kids-and-wife (North North!)
Nigga what's beef (North North!)
You can see me in the street (North North!)
I'ma show you what's real (North North!)
When the glock's in yo' grill (North North!)

Chorus

[Project Pat]
You can die out here (North North!)
