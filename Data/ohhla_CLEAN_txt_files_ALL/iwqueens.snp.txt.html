[Verse One: Lil' Kim]
Ev'rybody want a female rapper like Kim
None of these bitches got swagger like Kim
Don't believe that Biggie movie, that's not Kim!!!
Girl that's portrayin me, that's not Kim!!!
I got it covered like a Phantom umbrella
Waitin on me to stop I plan like never
I love it they never stop hatin boy I tell ya
So today I'm slashin them in all Donnatella
It's like money is my kinfolk
Y'all trippin thinkin I'm a stop gettin dough
Oh boy I get a rush as in the battle of the enzo
Yeah it's Kimmy, AKA forever bad
A hundred large in my forever bag
They might be in denial, but y'all know who the queen?
Call me dope girl, I got that new mean
Oh yeah I'm in my bag, who want the drama though?
I slam my checkbook down and tell 'em vamanos

[Chorus: Sample courtesy of "It Takes Two"] (Crowd Chanting) (*The Lady Of Rage)
I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now
I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now

(HEY!!! HEY!!! HEY!!! HEY!!!)
I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now (*Right what? Right now)
(HEY!!! HEY!!! HEY!!! HEY!!!)
I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now (*Right what?)

[Verse Two: The Lady Of Rage]
It's ya homegirl Robin and I don't need Batman
Comin off the head crazy, think I need a CAT scan (what?)
No imposters, put you Oscars' in a trashcan
I +Dropped the Bomb+ on you harder than the Gap Band
'Cause I, am, such a effin lady (effin lady)
Ha! Out in space like Weezy F'n Baby (F'n Baby)
{?}, you know my style is hardcore
The roughness is neccessary, fuckin with the legendary
Now let's address this (c'mon), who's the bestest?
(Who?) This brown dame, the Lebron James with breasts-es (UHH!!!)
Nutty when I spit it, like two steps from kookie
CRACK -- and I wanna rock right now like Pookie
Mama got a brand new swag and it's the freshest
Mo'Nique on a beat, don't make me touch you, Precious!
I spit a sick spell, like a shaman knows
I slam the bottle back (and tell 'em what?)
and tell 'em vaminos!

[Chorus: Sample courtesy of "It Takes Two"] (Crowd Chanting)
I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now
(SNOOP!!!!! DOGG!!!!!)
I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now
(SNOOP!!!!! DOGG!!!!! SNOOP!!!!! DOGG!!!!!)
(HEY!!! HEY!!! HEY!!! HEY!!!) I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now)
(HEY!!! HEY!!! HEY!!! HEY!!!) I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now)

[Verse Three: Snoop Dogg]
Boss Dogg chillin, lookin like a million
Yeah, nigga got it, I'ma leave it to my chil'ren
Tonight I'm on some other shit, and baby lovin it
Hella fast, grip dey ass like the oven mitt
I'm gooned up, boy! Rich as fuck, boy!
Black and gold brakes, that's my truck, boy
I'm on my Eastside, shit I'm workin
I got the party goin, and it's jerkin
My niggas all long, we rollin out deck
Hoes gettin in, you betta pick a bitch
'Cause when I shut it down, the party's over wit
She call me Superman, I'm on my +Soulja+ shit (YOOOOOOOU!)
Boss Dogg, get 'em, I sick 'em and take 'em home
West Coast bitch, I'm on my fuckin throne
I'm giggin on these hoes, do 'em like dominoes
And slam 'em on they back, and tell 'em vamanos
