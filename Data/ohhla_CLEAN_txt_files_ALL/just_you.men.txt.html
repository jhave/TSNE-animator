[Benzino]
Ladies and gentlemen, right now
We wanna bring forth to the stage
A very special guest
The undisputed Made Men

[Antonio Twice Thou]
Ayo don't run up on me, wit dat rah rah, 
Smoking lah lah
I'll blow holes in your dada, you nada
I toke a lotta, choke a lotta... from Havana
And stroke skins in the Ramada, I open drama
Told the lamas in my bomba, word to mama
Ready to war in pajamas in these cold streets
I hold heat... I'm a known thief, with gold teeth
Matching custom made gold  jeep
Croam rims, brown Tim's plus a Benz gettin' flown in
Equipt with shit to make domes spin
You average, we set standards
Trend set, Made Men wet
Anything moving in front of the Tek
With a maculet, acuret aim, crack the game 
With a homerun, blasting lames wit they own gun
And its on son, my air crowds got the spare gat
By the gear shaft, with the clear gats out like tear gas
The wrong ones since a young gun 
Notta unson hero with a filled sombrero
Gimme arms Memph, bomb threat phenomenom shit 
I get (Uh!) the doe (Uh!) 'cause I want it (That's right!)

[Benzino]
Made grams makin' alright 
While we push big cars under moon light
Be those 20 inche mirrors on Mercedes
Nigga knock for those niggas actin' shady
Never ever turn my back on my Made Men
Nigga when its time to set it, just say when
But for now we gonna ride like its do or die
And when its all set and done its just you and I

[Mr. Gzus]
C'mon, let the game break "G"
Even though its da grain 'cause of Made Men
Sellin' drugs with pistols just to get papes
211 your spot, leave you an 87
And a pen and pad be my only weapon
Aproachin' Armageddon, care to learn a cautious lesson?
Second guessin' in this life can be costly
When the bangs brokin' leave a nigga frosty
Frozen stiff from the 40 mill mega lift
&gt;From a game played out like a Sega gift
For the streets, shit take a major wiff    *sniffing*
Of the high ponent, seedless, canibus and teva, I believe that
It takes a lot of pain away, I do this everyday
It gotta be a betta way, lookin' for rider
Tomorrow been sufferin' the sorro
Took the heat, took the lead, now you follow 
Every road has two paths
Ones fun and laughs opposite of blood bath
I chose the better half, run with the cheddar staff
Avoid the garbage, recycle the trash
To get track cats slapped up and kidnapped
'Cause we rappin' don't mean  it can happen, see the gas clappin'
Atease, you been clear from the homicide
Nuthin' ta fear 'cause we here (Just you and I!)

[D Quest]
Here I go again (It's just you and I!)

Here I go again
That keeps us alright
Lets ride</pre>
