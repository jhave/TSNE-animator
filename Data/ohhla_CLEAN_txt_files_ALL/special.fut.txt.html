Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Freeband Gang!
Its only the chosen ones
That come from nothing and make millions
And can tell you doing it

[Chorus]
You ain't even trynna be special
You ain't even trynna be special
You ain't even trynna be special
I thought you was someone special

[Verse 1: Future]
You keep breaking down in front of me
How thats gon' look to my niggas when they honor me
I set the tone of this i can't let no one intervene
You can't take my pressure you probably be done blowed your brain
These bitches wanna' use everything i worked for the fame
You know the dues i paid but the money drive em' insane
They wanna go to court and sue me and take everythang
This double working on yo niggas and they taking aim
Im on the hide and imma stay up here right with the planes
You got a grammy and young nigga on that purple drank
Im a motherfucking astronaut and I'm untamed
I made a million off of metro ask the dope game
I booked the show up and rock the show up like some cocaine

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Future]
I bag bitches Burkin bag on bad bitches
Rags to riches I had it never lost it
I stayed at it i stayed flossing'
I been sleeping' in dope houses
My mind wasn't even there nigga
Im rare nigga
I been there nigga starving
My confidence been there nigga
When i was serving off them quarters
You wouldn't even though we had a plug
You wouldn't even think we had a plug
From corner bricks I been special
From corner bricks I been special
We here nigga
They counted us out we bounce back nigga
Now they back round with us
Like they was hustlin' back wit us
When we was puttin' that real on top fake in the middle
Turn that cake into some ice nigga
Its black migo for life
Black migo gang we here the original salute!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Future]
His momma hate me her mamma hate me
They hate I made it
They love when I struggle they love when I suffer
I got all the scars to prove it
I took my scars and made a movie
I got all my niggas with me through the bad and the good
I got all my jewels on me and I'm still in the hood
I can never stop from grinding cause I made it out the mud
I can never forget when I was on the block selling drugs
Codeine calm my nerves I was getting high since a kid
I took all my problems and I turned it all into hits
I can channel my anger now I can go make me some billions
They trynna' predict my next move but I say fuck politics
Long as I stick to the formula I'm never gon' switch
Freeband gang for life thats the blueprint

[Chorus]

[Outro: Young Scooter]
Juug!
