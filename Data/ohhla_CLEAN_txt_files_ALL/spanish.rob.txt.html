[Black Rob]
Yo look clown I come through bully down
Keep thinkin that you hard take a look around
I got soldiers stationed up to bring pain
And when it go down my hoes do the same thing
We all in the same game, we all willin to bang
Ain't nobody going against the grain, so take aim
B.R.'s evasive, cut all the faces, catch all the cases, this real 
You rather bet'cha life than face me
I mean I got this rap game locked with more cake than Tastee
Black the feindest, this title I hold I won't relinquish
And this type shit you shouldn't sting wish
And one phone call and I'll extinquish, I mean this you seen this
Blue steel fo-fo the caliber, Excalibur, Im'a destroy my next challenger
B. Rob high post MC, quick to spray Raid on the roach MC
So don't be apporachin me without the cross and rosary
Who this nigga 'pose to be, I blast him in the open beef
Damn Black, how you do that der?
'Cuz we..dont..care, I'll take 'em there

Chorus: Jennifer Lopez

Last night, I dreamed of some more dough
Some crystal, sixty thousand, and ten dimes of 'dro (I'll take 'em there)
Last night I realized I'm dreaming
Too late now, guess I'll finish what I started baby

[Black Rob]
Y'all niggas heard the first verse no doubt shit bangin
Verse two make sure none of y'all left hangin
Got honies lovin this shit too, one wit'choo
Long as you know my pants don't fit'choo
Money good look, understand why he shook
Shit I'm rich, face all up in the Guiness Book
Check, all the records I set, its major
Check, that the sets I wreck with flavor
Fuck that cajun, guns stay bond cock
?Boiler on lock? hold shit down like Fort Knox
Man, knock the rhyme unorthadox
What'cha barely understand, shit I deal with the L.O.X.
Give me the props, Im tryin set a mark this year
And bring the equipment out to the parks this year
So y'all could see how it used to be 
I'm lookin towards the future see
Black here to stay, its time y'all got used to me
Puff said Black ain't tryin to fit in
Up and down the coast can't count the spots I've been in
Put'cha bid in

Chours

[Black Rob]
I hit a ??? if my name was Teddy Bender
hot beats and hot rhymes tossed in a blenda'
I want ch'all to feel hardcore, nothin tenda'
Blessed this mic for as long as I remember
Y'all can't see the Rob, uh-uhh, y'all must be stupid
If I owe Shawn Combs any money then I recouped it
I looped it, this fly shit from ?Nebogada?
Me and Yogi and Hard Pierre from You Dont Know Me
I dare you to come against me, run against me
Use your gun against me, you finito, finished
I've seen wild cats diminished, foldin for, Bad Boy's known to ball
Internationally, I'm sayin actually 
I have to be the next cat to go and sell a million records casually
So, prepare yourself for the storm, Nineteen-nine-nine its on
And I'm just gettin warm
