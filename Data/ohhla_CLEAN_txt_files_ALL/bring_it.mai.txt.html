[Intro]
Bring it back DJ!!! Bring it back DJ!!! Uh!
Y-YEAH!!!! Y-YEAH!!!! MAINO!!!!

[Verse One]
You already know, move when I come through
You could run with winners, or lose if you want to
Mami here's your chance just tell me what you 'gon do?
Doin what I can now I'm doin what I want to
I be on that next ish diamonds in my neckless
Keep about thirty two shots in my tek clip
Holla at my thugs in the club livin reckless
Yeah it's lunchtime eat these lames up for breakfast
Nuvo sipper, I'm a Benz whipper
Shorty playin hard actin funny I'm a diss her
'Cause I'm a bread getter LV on the sweater
Droptop Phantom put that one on Twitter
NOW!!!!

[Chorus]

You already-you already-you already know, move when I come through

Mami here's your chance take a glance let me show you
Everything is real keep it thorough like I'm 'posed to

Bury me in Brooklyn I'm a black angel

[Verse Three]
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can move on, or you can bring it back
Look at how we roll mami this is where it's at
But if you got a man he don't do it like that
Baby I ain't no actor, black bandana
Can't get rid of me, baby I'm cancer
Life is a movie, look at all the cameras
People say they heard of me from here to Atlanta
This is how we play, one more time on replay
Standin in the DJ booth.... (Bring it back!!! Bring it back DJ!!!)
Let me hear that hit again, pkease play that hit again
Yeah Unstoppable, Maino, got another hit again

[Chorus]
Bring it back DJ!!! Bring it back DJ!!!
Bring it back!!! Bring it back!!! Bring it back DJ!!!
Let me hear that hit a-let me-let me hear that hit again!!!

Bring it back DJ!!! Bring it back DJ!!!
Bring it back!!! Bring it back!!! Bring it back DJ!!!
Let me hear that hit a-let me-let me hear that hit again!!!
Let me hear that hit a-hit-a-let me hear that hit again!!!</pre>
