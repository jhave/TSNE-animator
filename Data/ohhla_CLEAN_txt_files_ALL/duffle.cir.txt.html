[Hook]
If I don't nuthin I'ma ball
I'm countin all day like a clock on the wall
Now go and get your money little duffle bag boy
Said go and get your money little duffle bag boy get money
And I ain't ever ran from a nigga and I
Damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin
Look honey I ain't never ran from a nigga and I
Damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin get money

[Verse 1]
tha beat so hot the flow is so ice cold
walkin to the gucci store honey I'm home
I am on my shit I need a pamper on
toilet paper on the side for example hommie
I... get... money
I know you niggas ain't heard no shit like this and
while you wishing on that fallin star I'm in a foreign car
smoking out with the doors ajar
suede sun roof hangin out the big top
we leave the dealership head to the rim shop
you niggaz bearly dressin I got thousands piling
That's that salad dressin I'm on my thousand island
wildin... stylin... I be I get so much money its my i.d
Don't try me and if I don't do nuthin I'ma fuckin ball
and I ain't bout to start runnin nawl nigga nawl

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothin to a boss we ballin when you see us
we hear them haters callin they too far off to see us
unless they got they glasses on get your bifocal game
class is now in session now try to stay focus mane
your boy ain't good enough style ain't hood enough
would've could've should've wont do with us true enough
need a hoe break a hoe never nuthin new to us
turnin hoes to house wives never been cool with us
soon enough all these dealers are gonna catch up
till then fuck it I'm winnin so I'ma stack up
flows like a river the current is so rapid
hit with the wrachet thats how shit happens
next time you're yappin make sure it be about that big money talk
let that lil money walk call me what you want but don't call me for front
southside I got wut you want come holla at me

[Hook] - repeat 2X</pre>
