[Count Bass-D]
Four minutes and seconds, is all that we share
You've got dope high hats, ill kicks, and fresh snares
Though it's hard to resist, EQ and the bass til it eclipse
But no other sound's gonna do
So I'm saving all my rhymes for you

[Tock]
On the 4th day of February, a star was born
Bound to be legenday, and perform
Miracles from 24th Street to the jungle
Coming you to reach speak cause I'm humble
I wonder, if I take your crew
Evaluate your freestyle and make ya, stand alone
Until he break ya, leave your mind in pandemon
Me, I'm a break ya, spirit mind in flesh and bone
Up this, black fist activist
Polygamist rap tactition, young guns pugilist
It's on a mission, so all hail funk and listen
Buck the system, we running up and in the prison
Incarsarating wardens and releasing prisoners
Sip the Rimi Martin, shhhh, is for the listeners

[Count Bass-D]
Four minutes and seconds, is all that we share
You've got dope high hats, ill kicks, and fresh snares
Though it's hard to resist, EQ amd the bass til it eclipse
But no other sound's gonna do
So I'm saving all my rhymes for you

Ha ha ha, check this out, it's how we do it
Used to be on Sony now I'm taking a Spongebath
It's a long story, all y'all brothers don't know the half
This is mental telegraph from phonographs my epitath
Cause I'm sick of the riff-raff
I don't mean to offend all the citizens
But I extend my blends for friends that get bent
Only that got sent, I'm scheming on a way to pay the rent
With computer accompiament
And to you, I present a present
It's raw talent at it's finest
I kicked it with Schroder, you kicked it with Linus
And there's no need to define us cause that confines us
You wasn't down when we was riding the bus
So don't align us with you, you, and all of you
In the back, and in the middle, and in the front, yo
Y'all miss the pesos, we gets the spinach queso
I'm Kadeem Hardison, y'all ???

Four minutes and seconds, is all that we share
You've got dope high hats, ill kicks, and fresh snares
Though it's hard to resist, EQ amd the bass til it eclipse
But no other sound's gonna do
So I'm saving all my rhymes for you
