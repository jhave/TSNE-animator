Cause Ima straight up pyscho sick in the head
Lynchin them demons wit a bat
Cause them Christians understand I be that straight up pyscho
Lynchin them demons wit a bat, rat ta tat tat
Goes my gat, when I be pushin up 
on that trigger that be on my steel
And thats for real, I be knockin them demons out like Holyfield
Well buck buck buck, yea them demons be gettin struck
Cause a demon tried to do my wrong
He's lyin to me tryin to tell me 
that Jesus didn't love and He wasnt real
So I stole up on his grizill
I got up on my knees and startin 
lynchin that demon wit a spiritual prayer
Just like in the rugged rhyme sayer *mixing sounds*
Demons try to step they get struck on the dome
Or grill so chill before I get bucked wild
Cause Ima straight up pyscho kinda like Micheal
Myers, I'm eatin up the devil like Dryer's ice cream
If you know what I mean
And I got a bald head just like Mr. Clean
Cause I'm clean from the sin
Got the Holy Ghost within
My soul, so I won
Cause the blood of the Son
Was shed and red so that we can be forgiven
Now I be slayin them sucka demons like a turkey on Thanksgiving
Word is bomb, I broke the devil's arm
So ring the alarm, I conquered demons just like Babalon
Conquered Judah, I don't praise buddah, don't smoke that huddah
And like Das Effects I'm comin straight from the sewer
Who knewa, stuff that I had last year wit no fear
I step up to that demon and I beat him down
Wit a rugged sound comin straight from the underground
Demons dry to strike, I peel their cap
 
[Chorus]
 
[T-Bone]
Its like that when I got my strap
So whats it to ya, boo ya
Another demon got blasted 
And now its time to get drastic 
Like Jurrasic Park, demons try to creep in the dark
But what they don't know is that I be waitin around the corner
Wit my heater, down to beat a
A demon til he's screamin and afraid
Demons can't fade cause I got my King James switch blade
In my hand, jaded that be B I B L E
The Basic Instructions Before Leavin this planet
And like Janet, Jackson God is in control
So act like ya know
That I be that knick knack paddy wack
Pyscho dog T-Bone, buckin demons upside the dome
Wit the chrome, cause I'm that lunatic from Frisco
And I'm still down wit E-Dog and Bisco
So loud up the clip and spray
I smoke demons and leavin em in an ash tray
Cause I'm that brother that really don't care
Got no hair, go ahead and dare
Me to put in work, those demons are hurt
I'm be doin dirt, cause when it comes to demons I'm steamin
So I'm down to catch a body if the body be the devil's
Wit the bass and treble, yo I'm takin it to a higher level
Mutalatin demons when I'm on the mic I'll
Then shoot em wit my riffle
Cause Ima 
 
[Chorus]
 
[T-Bone]
I don't know how to act, cause I'm goin insane in the brain
This is one lunatic that they can't maintain
Cause Ima pyschopathic latin causin racket
Demons couldnt calm me wit a straight jacket
Packin the Bible every single day of my life
Cause 1 2 3, the devils' after T
Bone on the micra-phone
Everyday, so I pray pray pray
Til my hair turns grey
I turn away from sin and chose a path thats narrow
Duckin and dodgin the devil's arrows
That he be throwin in my direction
Put my protection is in Jesus Christ
So I do not need a gang or a crew
So whacha gonna do
Cause the devils' after you
Patna, yeah
 
[Chorus]</pre>
