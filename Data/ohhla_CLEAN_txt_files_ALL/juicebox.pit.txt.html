I'm Cuban - I'm good with the water - salt or the soda
I've been raised on valium, I'm beat
Pera roba, gun shine state - Florida!
Now hold up!
You know what it is, what it aint when them boys there roll up
Yeah we got it sewed up
We got a toe up from the floor up, now so what

I want, I need, I like, to get - Money, money, money, money
I want, I need, I like, to get - Money, money, money, I like
Her right there and her friend over there, I like
Her right there and her friend over there, I like
Her right there and her friend over there, I like
Her right there and her friend over there, I like
That juice box wet, she keep that juice box juicy, I like
That juice box wet, she keep that juice box juicy, I like
That juice box wet, she keep that juice box juicy, I like
That juice box wet, she keep that juice box juicy, I like

My life - Vincent Van Gogh couldn't paint it
And I love that you hate it (hate it)
I fuck em, you date em
I'm hotter than Satan, look partner just save it (save it)
I went from Opa Locka Boulevard to paradise - Point Drive thats right
Now I walk in the club, look in dey eyes and tell em lets ride... DALE!

I want, I need, I like, to get - Money, money, money, money
I want, I need, I like, to get - Money, money, money, I like
Her right there and her friend over there, I like
