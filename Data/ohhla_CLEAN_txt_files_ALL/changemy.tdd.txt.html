[Hook]
Gotta change my life
Lord knows I ain't livin right
Yall know I ain't chillin right
Smokin out everyday and night
Gotta ease my mind
Gotta find time to rewind
Cause I'm fallin way behind
Me and my dogs we known to ride

Gotta watch my back
Represent for the 'Sota
Die couple years older
Have boulders, in the 'Sota
Get rich with a motive
Now shit done changed
Niggaz gunnin in the rain
On straight cocaine
And it ain't no thang
Since the game in his arm
Straight aim at his arm
Gotta watch my back
Gotta stack my flow
Gotta pay my bills
Leave bread in the will
All to the old girl 
See yall hoes betta chill
Now back to the game
Lotsa niggaa been dying for this
Done lost they lives to this
Got me on this survival some type of AK rider
Na I started with thug
A thug with a heart
Took a trip with some heart
Had a dude he was scarred
See his maom in the park
Tears dried up
Mom what's wrong (what's wrong)
Your son's gone 
Is he ever comin back home
She said you straight young nigga 
Take a look in the mirror 
I was there when you was gone
Now back to the streets
Where young niggaz like me
Gon do what we got to do
You ain't nuttin without ya crew
Betta light in the night and I'm thinkin bout you
In the bedroom tied uo
With ya mouthpiece wired up
Just shaped on the floor
Had none of ya guns keep muthafuckaz fired up
An see that's the truth
I done told my nigga this street shit ain't a game
But it seem the same
Young nigga get slanged 
For a lil bit a fame and cocaine
Try to do thangs
Just for the benzs and beamers and bithces
Thinkin riches gon take care snitches
And niggaz wit triggaz
Niggaz betta watch they back
Cuz the same time I'm tryin to speak to you and realease to you 
Some shit ya need 
Young nigga wit greed gon try to put the heat to you
speed to you

[Hook]

They callin in the gat
In the dunge with a guy
Ski mask and a vest
Let his heart do the rest
Thuggin, broke niggaz be the best
Yes, and gon die if ya buck
So get fucked right up
Come back if ya like
Bring ya gat if ya like
And get stacked if ya like
On ya back if ya like
All I neded was a chance
A MAC-10 and a benz
So I can clown with my friends
Show the world I'm a man 
Then broke but those in the pen
When I'm off in the club
Much love for the thugs
See hennessy in the clubs
Got all these rabid ass, maggot hoes
they love the thugs

[Hook] - 2X

Now bout dem hoes
Try to find them a man
That can pay they bills
And yes they can
Weight 28 grams
Take a tour of the land
ain't got no plan
They'll wait for a thug
Go give em a hug
Show em how to be loved
Then suck em up
Straight fuckin em up
Then get in his benz
Get with all his friends
Take all his ends
Then send him to the pen
Then do it all again
Amen
But lord forgive em
Have mercy on they're souls
For livin like hoes 
And say a lil prayer for me and my life
Cuz I ain't livin right you know I

[Hook] - repeat until fade</pre>
