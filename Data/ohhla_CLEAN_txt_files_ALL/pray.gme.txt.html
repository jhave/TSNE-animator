She got on tights with the leather skin
She a rock star, bring the heavy metal in
Girl shaped like a +Coke+ bottle, Medellín
In love with her 'til she went and let the devil in
She pop pills like medicine
She probably gon' die, it's startin to be evident
I told her, "Slow down, girl you're heaven-sent"
I'm a thug but I got a +Hart+ like Kevin them
And I can't let this girl throw her life away
Kick the door in her room and I told her put the knife away
Took her to the hospital like right away
She a angel with demons, the girl like night and day
Stressed out, parents gettin divorced
Girl love 'em both, she ain't tryin to sit in court
She a square so it's hard to see the angle
and that's why God gave her an guardian angel
It's me, and I'm here for her
Swear to God that I'm here for her
Last nigga got her caught up in the airport
She ain't had no pride so she went and did a year for him
She a +Ryde or Die+, like Eve and them
Make home-cooked meals every evening
Start strippin on the side, now I'm tippin on the side
Love life like Joseline and Stevie and them
Am I wrong, for bein the best, that I can to her?
Takin her son and tryin to be a man to him
She don't wanna pray but I told her put her hands to it
I done came a long way from that tan Buick
Yeah, grandmother would be proud of me
Almost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me
Remember momma knockin on the door HAM
then he bought her a car and a crib even though she doubted me

[JSMN] + (Game)
Yeah yeah, when I wake up every day (even though she doubted me)
I thank the Lord that we are safe (even though she doubted me)
Again, yeah yeah (even though she doubted me)
That's why you should pray for me

[Game]
That's my momma, and I love her
with my heart, like I love you
If you strugglin, baby daddy ain't takin care of the kids
Girl you can get a hug too
I'm here whenever you need me
Gon' reach out, it's that easy
I love women, cause without women
wouldn't none of us niggaz be breathin
So let's (pray) bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head

[J. Cole]
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Cole
Good girl at heart, I remember you well, I remember you well
Got a husband and kid but I flirt
Hope you do a little dirt cause I'm diggin you still
That's real, but nah you don't text back
And deep down I respect that
Cause even though a nigga wanna tap that shit
I don't wanna be the one to wreck that shit
So, so I fall back
Year go by I got more plaques
Just to get a call from you tellin me you miss me
and you wanna see me next time the tour's back
Damn, well what changed then?
She tellin me her nigga had her caged in
Every time she think about me on the road
She be cryin realizin all the places that she ain't been
Well it's cool, I'll pick you up
Hold you down, lift you up
These other niggaz try and fuck
I'm the only one who cut and still came back to stitch you up
So we fuck, say what?
You ain't been home lately, you ain't heard that nigga
Her man left cause she cheated on his ass
Found her pills in a bag, yo she burned that nigga
She burned that nigga
Say what? She burned that nigga
She burned that nigga
Say what? She burned that nigga
Dawg - she burned that nigga
He beat her ass in the crib
Then he went and did a bid all cause the bitch burned that nigga
Now dawg, that's real ass shit
That's word 'round the Ville ass shit
Get the strap up, get the strap up
Please tell me that you strapped up nigga
We could kill that bitch
if you want to, I'm cool
I strapped up, played by the rules
Damn, while I'm sittin here blessed
She at the crib all alone and she's stressed
So nigga I pray, bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Just bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head

[JMSN]
When I wake up every day
I thank the Lord that we are safe
Again, yeah yeah
That's why you should pray for me
Ohhhh when I wake up every day
I thank the Lord that we are safe
Amen, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh
That's why you should pray for me
That's why you should pray</pre>
