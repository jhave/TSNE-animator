[Chorus-Magnif]
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats

[Verse 1-Griot]
I'm from a place where the agents send
It's a age of sin, no matter what grade ya in
Not the muscle, it's the hustle that's made within
Dyke ten's, Bangor rims persuade the grin
Hustle up in the PJ's, no time for relay races
Gettin' big money, that's how we change faces
Never been ill with a pill like Mike
And sound ill on the mic, matter fact, yo, I'm realer than life
Gee and crate niggaz still on the mic
Break niggaz who be feelin' they hype, aight?
Clown ass niggaz makin' my profession a joke
I drown ass niggaz up to they throats, choke on a quote
Talk six to the God is blasphemy, they ask from me
The lesson that blow, the answer to the question is "No"
While ma' fuckas keep testin' the flow
LE be in the D, we blessin' a show

[Chorus-Magnif]
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats

[Verse 2-Big Tone]
Yo, we don't lean up at the bar, niggaz, malt liquors
Spillin' off in a cup, Grenadine Corona from a small pitcher
Pertinent Rip Hamilton jersey half tucked
Jake's Porter house thick, tossin' 'round hits
In the city of Boom, hit my city with tunes
That instantly bloom buds before a industry move
We bust, anything move, leave it right where we seen it
Leanin', rap shit, D shit reachin' ya region
Air One's crispy enough to squeak on the cement
Hood rich, sharper than the crease on my jeans is
Savage beast to a beat, one son of a mean bitch
Genetic make-up in trade of a Lizzy street kid
I watch destiny, from the shot to the ebony
Waitin' in the wings, patient with a dream
Poppin' out a collar, them sleeves bust, wavin' at my bean
With them characteristics right there in the Mitten

[Chorus-Magnif]
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats

[Verse 3-Phat Kat]
Ugh, the stripes I got from the game will fill up both of my sleeves
I sit yo ass down for good like Christopher Reeves
Situations like this, better to give than recieve
Four wolves 'll bite that ass, homes, so please believe
Eat you down to the bone and bring some back to me
Around the cassy, some be better than the last nigga
Put down them guns and bet I'll whip yo ass, nigga
Don't get it twisted, I'm just provin' a point
With the raps gloryfiyin', doin' time in the joint
In the land with ya man got yo ass locked up
While yo woman in the free world with her ass knocked up
Where Blacks with crazy years fuck cocaine rocked up
Turn on the TV, all you see is people slain, chopped up
We in Iraq fightin' for oil, still price shot up
And around election time, watch Bin Laden pop up, yeah, yeah

[Chorus-Magnif]
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats
Motown, Motown, that's where we be
Stand up, get live for the D
It's Big Tone, Phat Kat, LE
Kill 'em with the rhymes and with the beats</pre>
