Ass droppin, titties floppin
Coochie hole poppin

[Verse 1: Kaos]
Papi's wit that nah'jae on top baby the fact is
That I done get up in more pussy than a taxman
You hurr me on the radio bringin that heat up
Through the speaker but what you don't know is
That is goes deeper, bring me that basket fruit and
You can see just how I suck on my melons and
Eat the shit out of my peaches
In my past girl I done things to numb things
Mmm-hmm I see you beat to sellin tongue rings
Wit me 2 minute feezy and KemoSaubee keeps em
Down the lobby cuz they done heard about that nah'jae

Ahhhh go 'hed mama pop that ass and that body shit

Girl I can't let you lick my cock if you ain't swallowin'

So imagine how my brain be racin when shake it girl
That ass fat, them titties right but in a harder truth

Tellin me you can take it but you cannot hardly go
But I can't fake it girl you rode me like a Harley slooow

[Bridge: Kaos]

Doin ya thurlthizzle, baby fo-shizzle
Yes'ir
