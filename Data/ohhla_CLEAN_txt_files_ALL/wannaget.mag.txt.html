Makes me wanna get away
(I wanna get away)
It makes me wanna get away
(I wanna get away)
It makes me wanna get away
(I wanna get away)
It makes me wanna get away

It's not a day go past I don't get a call, somebody need me
And I glance and I see my niggas on the TV
Lying dead, front page of the paper
I close my eyes, wishing I can wish this shit away, but I can't
Four other people died that day
And I know thier families probably feel the same way
Four other families felt the same yesterday
You don't think that's enough reason for us all to pray
Two girls got raped and they lost their virginity in my viscinity
Six more of my niggas on thier way to penetentaries
Just watch the news, every day it's fuckin problems
They feeding evil to our people, making promise
Quick to point the finger at the mama's
But what about the men's, 
they always making promises to make it better
A bad plane crash, J.F.K. Jr.
That was the world, my heart goes to ya

[Peaches/(Magic)]
Makes me wanna get away
(I wanna get away)
It makes me wanna get away
(I wanna get away)
It makes me wanna get away
(I wanna get away)
It makes me wanna get away
(I wanna get away)

Another morning, ain't nothing changed, devil's still at my door
So I embrace myself for life as I pick my glock up off the floor
Got so many words, Lord when will my mind be free
Everything that look gold just ain't gold, 
shit yall would like to be me
I always thought that money would make me happy 
but it seems to add to my stress
Believe me I ain't complaining, cause yall know this life is a mess
I mean I'm blessed, must confess, brought me from the bottom to the top
But was it a test, the reason I was put in this spot
I lost my daddy when I was only eighteen years old
And I found out that same year this world is colder then a polar bear
Dig that advantage, life is stressing me out
A nigga got to go through all this bullshit just to make him some clout
This world is like a puzzle and I'm just trying to fit
Without putting myself on that road to that bottomless pit
Forgive me Lord, yall know that I ask something rich
It's just a shame that this life is a bitch

It makes me wanna get away
