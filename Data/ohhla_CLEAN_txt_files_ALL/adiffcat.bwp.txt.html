Verse 1:
[L]
This is the way I know you love it
So you want something, I took it I fucked it
You came, I know what's funky
You lose juice, now run get a juice
So yo, don't compare me with another
It's not the average everyday motherfucker
Sucker, the bitch, headed before shit
I heard enough of that bullshit
I'm a turn it around, tear up the town
Mark sex, drop the sound
Don't try and diss this, you'll a miss
In a toilet, I'll flush you like piss, bitch
No time to battle, no time to waste wars
Just ride and slamming to the goddam floor
Kick it, live, no half stepping
The posse's in effect, your best bet checking
The B, W, and the P
It's not just a crew, it's a whole damn posse
The rhymes I throw, flow like low
Crack, speed, yo, it's all dope
Do ho, slow, slander my name
You poo-butt wannabe sucker searching fame
Slamming, to a different swing
It's a 90's thing
And since you is a wannabe, here's the story
I'm in A Different
Category
So kick this one here
Kick this one here
Kick this one here for me and my bitches
Verse 2:
No fucking or sucking, bitch stop bugging
Go on and tender my clit for a lick
[L &amp; TM]
Damn, ho

But I'll start the show,  that's if you're ready  to go
Step to B.W.P., you'll get your head blown
Mama spit you out her ass, make you a rapper
For doing stupid shit like that, I should have slap her
Put me to a test, compared me to the rest
