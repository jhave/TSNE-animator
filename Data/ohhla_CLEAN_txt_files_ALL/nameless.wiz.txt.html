Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Lifestyle of the rich and famous
While I'm rich and Famous
If you don't your Nameless

Yeah.... 84 that 3 in a pot
These niggas jealous I'm something they not
Its all good shit I expected that
Shit I been sleep since I lifted off where we left at
Yeah its cool to you
But its what we deserve
Needle on the track, I'm dope
You niggas got some nerv
Thats drug talk
88 volvos
Gold bbs man rip macho

Shit where I'm from even kids know da call
Hit it with some ice
Just to cool it off
I was working up on that corner like I had a job
Up in that corner serving I ain't have a prob

I still feel like I'm sleepin
With all of this happenin
Am I dreaming
But shit I'm high and I'm wide awake
And wat I want I can afford
Ain't that an escape

Life styles of the rich and famous
While I'm rich and famous
Well if you got money
They know what your name is
If you don't your nameless

Uh.... talking raw papers and long leathers
Niggah my drawer fill with couture texters
Killing these niggahs bring more stretchers
Amazed at how I'm in that new
Mason martin margela
With my team
Where my car dealer

Smoking big green I'm talking godzilla
You talking money then you sound familiar
The suite wasn't big enough fo me
I bought the villa
The whip was sick enough
I went and got the ill one
Your tree wasn't enogh good thing
I brought some killa
Bitch I'm the king and all my team
Is loyal niggas

My wifes a queen with diamond rings
And full of chinchillas
And I was raised with niggas
With get money intentions
Lot of young niggas gettin made
But I'm the realist
Give a fuck about if a niggah hatin
My dollar accumulation
My only motivation

Life styles of the rich and famous
While I'm rich and famous
Well if you got money
They know what your name is
If you don't your nameless

Life styles of the rich and famous
While I'm rich and famous
Well if you got money
They know what your name is
If you don't your nameless</pre>
