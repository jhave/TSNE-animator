Yeah
[ CHORUS ]
It's my block, my hood, my turf
Them gangstas be doin dirt, them hustlers be movin work
(On the turf)
It's my block, my hood, my turf
Them killers be doin dirt, them niggas be movin work
(On my turf)
In my block, my hood, my turf
Them gangstas be doin dirt, them hustlers be movin work
(On the turf)
It's my block, my hood, my turf
Them killers be doin dirt, them niggas be movin work
(On my turf)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Yeah
Nigga, you call it the block, I call it the turf
Whoa, you call it a rock, I call it the work
Yeah, you call it welfare, I call it the first
Niggas call it granddaddy, but I call it the purp'
Yessir, you call it a ki, I call it a bird
Word, you call it the street, I call it a curb
Yessir, you call it the hills, I call it the burbs
And niggas call me (?) cause I stay all in the dirt
Like Tyrese knee-deep in the dirt, beefin like Smurf
High-tech hustle, fiends beep when they chirp
I'm that nigga that the feds wanna see in the dirt
Cause I be beatin up the block while I be bleedin the turf
The turf is what we call the hood
George Bush is what we call the good
And gatorbacks is what I call the wood
It's understood, I boss up like a baller should
This for my turf niggas trappin out in all the hoods

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Nigga, you call it the ghetto, I call it the 'jects
Whoa, you call it a gang, you call it the set
Yeah, you call it Cali but I call it the West
Niggas call it brown weed but I call it the cess
Yessir, you call it the sherm, I call it the wet
Whoa, you call it a thizz, I call it a x
Yes, you call it head, I call it gettin some neck
And niggas call me Ice-T, a O.G. in the flesh
I got connect with the Mex so I sell them birds wet
Kanye Workout Plan, I make the girls stretch
Catch me in my turfed out van puffin on a bless
And I can get that work out, man, you fuckin with a vet
Yes, 65 100 block, the Ville, that's the turf
Where you see me runnin from the cops tryina get a 100 knots
Now I run the block and I run the spot
The work on the turf, the money at my underspot

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Nigga, you call it the slums, I call it the trap
Whoa, you call it a gun, I call it a strap
Geah, you call it bread, I call it gettin some scratch
You call that snitch an informant but I call him a rat
Yessir, you call it a pound, I call it a pack
Whoa, you call it brown, I call it the 'yac
Geah, you call it dice, I call it shootin some craps
And bitches call me Max Ju' cause they be choosin the Mack
On the track you find hustlers, pimps and hoes
Gangstas liftin weights on the porch gettin swoll
My hardballs was high, I had to pitch 'em low
Pitch up slow so all my goons could get this dough
Hit the 'dro behind tint grippin on wood
My turf is like yo turf, we live in the hood
Live on the block, live on the streets, live on the ave
This for my turf niggas gettin that cash
On my block
