One, two
To a nigga nature
Hehe

[Verse 1]
No need to cry now, go wipe your tears
Be a woman, why you actin' surprised?
You showed the bullshit; commin' fake hair
fake nails, fake eyes too
So why you bound to fuck wit fake guys too
Aint nothin' hard about it
Why you lookin' sad, should'a though about it
Say you learn, i truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
Gettin' freaky with the thug niggaz up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Don Perione (spellin?)
Knowin' I'm a cash dealer, still I, remain calm
Let you chill with me
Plus you was smilin' 'til the bill miss me
That's what you get for trynna dick me
Missed me with that "buy me this, buy me that"- syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
Gettin' mad 'cuz i cursed and i screamed i hate'cha
Introduced you to a nigga nature, feel me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Probably too nice at first
I lettin' you kiss where it hurts
Me and you gettin' busy, slangin' dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, toungkissin', you was trouly with it
Little Exstacy, Hennesey, mix with me
Picture me pray for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggaz at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet
Pointin' at the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the room, call the cops
Nigga, hit them walls til the bastard drop
Label me: Makaveli - Thug Nigga with pipe
Livin' life as a Rock Star friday nights
Make money, get pussy
Always keep a pager, cell-phone in the ride
To complete my Nature now!

[Chorus] (That's a nigga nature!)

[Verse 3]
Started as a seed from the semen
Straight outta Papa's nuts, lustin' for creamin'
Bitches wit big butts, curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno fleeks
Sneak weed in, helped a nigga passed the time
With my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood
Follow me, I got a gun on me
Goin' for nun on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when i be thuggin' til i die
Picture of nigga in heaven high, of weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies with the phonies that died
Hit the weed and hope it get me high
Dear God, understand my ways, livin' major
Blessed with a thug's heart
In a realla nigga nature!

[Chorus x2] (That's a nigga nature!)
	    (Just be a nigga nation)
	    (It ain't my fault, that's a nigga nature)
	    (A nigga nature)</pre>
