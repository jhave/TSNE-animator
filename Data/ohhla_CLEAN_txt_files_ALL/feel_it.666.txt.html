[Juicy J - Verse 1ne]
Say, I'm at the bar, gonna have a barre
Sippin Ketel One, stumblin to the car
But I don't wanna leave 'cause it's too crunk
And these girls got a lotta junk in the trunk
Red bones (red bones), black bones (black bones)
white chocolates (chocolates), big tones (big tones)
Breakin them backs, it's on
I'm a gigolo and it's gone
A freak of the week, tryna get a piece
She better know how the boom stay wit the beat
All on the floor, I gotta get this
Shakin that ass and I'm all in her ear sayin
I'm in the club, gettin wasted
Drink so much, I cain't even taste it
Girls on the floor, I gotta get this
Shakin that ass and I'm all in her ear sayin

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
I-I say DJ turn the music up (Up!)
and send another round over to my cup (Cup!)
I wanna FEEEEEEEEL it (HO!)
Oh, oh, ohhh-ohh

[DJ Paul - Verse 2wo]
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah~!
She-she went face down (down!)
And she went ass up (up!)
I seen her gettin it for free, so I put my money up
But we hit that bar hard
The drinks keep flowin and flowin
She make that booty pop
It just keep growin and growin
You know I had to get 'er
Gotta hit 'er up on {?}
'Cause ain't nothin in the world
Better than a drunk and hot girl
that'll break it {down Down DOwn DOWn DDDD-DOWN DOWN DOWN}
to the {ground GROund GROUnd GROUNd GROUND GROUND GGGGGGG-GROUND GROUND}

[Chorus]


[Flo Rida - Verse 3hree]
Heeeey~! I gotta stunt like it's the first of the month
in the projects, just got paid
DJ, keep it comin, keep on breakin 'em off 
and bring it back just for the hood sake
Still spendin gwap for the women, they fly
Reppin the bottom, ain't got it, no lie
Travel the world in the G4 alot
Poe Boy the family and we get it hot
I got the beat where the music is live
Rock to the beat like my {?} catch a vibe
Give me that heat 'tll we all feel the fire
I'm in the streets, but the club get me high
Partaaay! Get shinin to rock the body
The fellas on the jock, the shade's {?}
We do it non-stop, get on Barcardi
