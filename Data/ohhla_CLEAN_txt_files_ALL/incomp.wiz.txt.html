Song:   Incompatible
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Incom, incom, incom, incom, incompatible, (Oh)
It don't matter though (Oh)
Cause someone's bound to hear my cry (Oh Oh Oh Oh)
Speak out if you do (Oh)
You're not easy to find (Oh)

[Verse 1]
They say I'm on some shit, but I'm just workin hard
If you ain't on your job, then we can't get along
I'm smokin everyday, my money getting long N niggas gon hate
That's why I made this song
Shorty blowin up my phone, she say that she in love
No matter how much I give her, she say it ain't enough
Hold up it's not a game, no I'm not the one to play with
You see the ice and lights on my spaceship?
Yeah, I'm out here livin, nigga famous in my songs
My paper too right, I can't do wrong
You think too small, I see the big picture
N I fuck with real niggas, so I can't do ya'll
Too gone, I be reppin Taylor Gang, who ya'll?
N that talkin you doin can't do harm
Cause I'm on, nothing left you can lie bout
but it only took once for me to find out
Pussy nigga we're..

[Chorus]
Incompatible
It don't matter though
Cause someone's bound to hear my cry
Speak out if you do
You're not easy to find

Incompatible
It don't matter though
Cause someone's bound to hear my cry

[Verse 2]
She say I'm on some shit, cause I don't be at home
She called her daddy down, but I be on the road
Gotta get this money, so I gotta do these shows
Text me every day, but I don't even call or respond
Got the nerve to say I don't do you wrong
Look at my picture every time you hear my song
I tell you all the time, I get it together
Shoulda listened to ya girls, you can do better
I'm gone when you need me, busy when you're alone
It's hard to believe me, when I'm in the studio
Groupie hoes on a nigga, follow anywhere he go</pre>
