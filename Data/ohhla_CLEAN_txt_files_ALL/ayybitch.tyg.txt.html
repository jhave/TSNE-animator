Song:   Ayye Bitch
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ayye bitch, T-Raww
Bad bitch, fuck her better with the lights on
Me go psycho in the pussy she don't mind at all
Me high off a molly, now I tell her fuck Big Sean
Psycho might go, niggas don't like no
Nigga getting money, want me dead like Castro
Jump her on my lap, then go yonkers to my odd flow
Top flow, telescope, watch her and die slow
(Fire flow) animal, cookie eat a rookie, I'm Geronimo
The diabolical, carnival
Eat the shit now I got holla toast
Halitosis I'm dopest nicca you ain't know this
Drop 150 on the yacht
Master, Im a massacre, let the ice kill the watch
Fucking two bitches while my other bitch watch
My conceited bitch in London, she speaks so posh
Nigga is that Ti-na, nigga is that vo-ha
She fucked the whole crew, now the hoes wo-la
These days, too many lies, too many rhymes
Cashing out getting mine motherfucka, then I'm out
W-W-Well Done</pre>
