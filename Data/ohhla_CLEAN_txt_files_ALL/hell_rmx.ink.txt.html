Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus 2x]
You can tell them that
I've been from hell &amp; back
When the heat is on, I fire back
In this cold world, where your lighters at
Let's burn it down, f-f-fire back

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, let's burn it down underrated
Could never say I was underground
Maybe a little misunderstood when I'm just riding round
In all lanes like all OJ
Doing big things, no small change
We ain't going nowhere like wine stains
You see me with the Arsenal
Welcome to the Austin show
Alumni, lace up, don't trip, I got it, bro!
Sold out in my city, overseas, in your state
Wore XXL white T's and freshen to the XXL 2012 freshman
Damn, I rose up, in the front like Rosa
It's been a roller coaster, now I'm riding in a Rover!
See the camera's out, bitch you gotta stay focused
They expose us, but it's still so much
I swear that you don't notice man!
You can tell them that I've been through hell and back
But I'm home, yeah, took a little time getting here
But I'm finally in my zone
So gone off that loud you can hear it in my tone
Put your lighters in the air
Let's start a fire storm!

[Chorus]
You can tell them that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on
I fire back
In this cold world
Where your light is at
Just burn it down
Fire back
You can tell them that
I've been through hell and back
When the heat is on
I fire back
In this cold world
Where your light is at
Just burn it down
Fire back!

[Verse 2: MGK]
As we bow our heads
Amen, praise God for everyone
That made it out of the dark like cave men
And is this my moment? Shit cause I've been waiting
Came in the game the least favorite
Made it through rain, now it's hailing
I'm just saying!
Hell and back there ain't no trip for me
Please Satan don't hold me back
God said this ain't it for me
But these haters done got me trapped
Shit! And it's these haters that got me strapped
Paranoid by my friends, cause these favors done that got me jagged
Consequence a bunch of all the misdemeanors that I was willing to do to get some rougher ends until the cops, woop, woop
Then I'd hop the fence
You still owe me an old-school like Das EFX
Another call collect and it's sad cause
Those are the friends that you grew with
Telling me they knew that they knew I'd make it
And now you got the chance to go prove it, gone
Pay stubs, cold cash, work this and I sold that
Wrote this in my notepad
Spill more ink than my whole tatts
Spill blood on that stage, uh
I'm the truth, and they know that
Critics lie, but these numbers don't
Say hello, to this gold plaque it's Kells

[Chorus]
You can tell them that
I've been through hell and back
When the heat is on
I fire back
In this cold world
Where your light is at
Just burn it down
Fire back
You can tell them that
I've been through hell and back
When the heat is on
I fire back
In this cold world
Where your light is at
Just burn it down
Fire back!</pre>
