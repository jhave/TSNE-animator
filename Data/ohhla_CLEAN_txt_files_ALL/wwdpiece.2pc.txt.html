[Open Skit: Some Woman talking]
Shit!
Ain't nothing wrong with fucking with a nigga from the east coast (Coughing)
Ain't nothing wrong with getting a little piece of the east (No Doubt!)
You know I stayed on the West Coast and I'm the queen with the most
UMM, I fuck with the East Coast nigga and that's for damn sure

[Guy]
Hey, hey baby I'm from the east and I recognize shit I'm from the east 
And you know and I just got a call from my man Pac
And we were talking about how we like to toss them up
How we like our bitches you know? (Mm, hmm)
So uh I mean, so I loooove me some Cali' pussy

[Woman]
Alright nigga you don't know nothing about Cali pussy though (Yeah yeah)
You couldn't possibly know nothing bout this west shit right her

[Verse One: Greg Nice]
Ugh ugh ugh ugh (shit check it out)
Yo, money don't grow on trees
Everybody talking about they're moving Ki's
Probably, they're getting dirt on their knees
No time for bull or crap, I got to get these
Soon as I step my feet up in the jam
Eye balls on me wanna know who I am
Fail to realize I'm the same man
Made it funky for you, with the pure blim blam
A jelly fish, uh, you know I can't stand
Hung out with my crew, Jerked more than a grand
Fronting ass nigga ain't nothing but a fan
I know we can make it, yes we can can, Greg N-I-C-E 
Game player get dough and buy land
Expand and help my brother man
Check me out y'all, ah check me out y'all
Ah check me out, ah Check me out, ah check me out y'all y'all

[Verse Two: Capitol L.S.]
Let me lick you up (Word is bond) 
Let me lick you down (Behind the fat bushes)
Come on baby, let me lick you all around
What do you do? when the pussy leaves you stranded?
Nine times out of ten I escape like the bandit
I took this slanted dime bitch for granted
I couldn't understand it the ass broke out like mass transit
I was with it cushy, was with the freaky deeky
The dickey dickey equivalent to the dickey dickey
My mushy pushy was all up inside your cushy pussy (Alright)
Aiyyo yo, you make sure she gushy gushy 
Without a doubt, yo I'll be all on top of that
My dick stays strapped, with a top hat
I peeked your nipples, protruding through your negligee
And hey you say we can do this shit here everyday
Lets works this out like Jane Fonda
Over turkey Lasagne, or we can take this to the back of the Honda
You need to feel warm nut on your breasts
Ain't nothing fucking with them bitches from the west

[Verse Three: Tupac]
Eternally thug nigga, heal figure, made by Tommy
So when I speak hope to reach my bi-unique mammies
Or come to poppy, I love it when it's wet and sloppy
In and out the mouth piece until I cum no one can stop me
My bump and grind will do you every time
Come get a blast of this thug passion, it'll blow your mind
Hey, throw up your legs, wrap them shits around my back
It's a West Side thing, fucking whores around the map
Walking down 125 while I'm peeping out hotties
And they.. seduce my jimmy I'll be screaming give me body
Make them all scream my name out, give me my props and don't you
Love how this thug nigga beat up the cock
I'm at the weekend parade, I'm watching caramel bitches play
Get with real niggaz, bullshit will never get you paid
This is the dream of a young black teen
I fiend for whores across country like a dirty crack fiend
Now come on

[Verse Four: Asu]
I get my shit off like clothes before sex
Stepping to bitches like cortex
Matter fact you're next - on the agenda
So I'ma send a fucking head if you say the wrong sentence
Sprint like long distance
Hit some laps baby, I'm busting raps baby
Chilling with them niggaz that's fucking peeling caps baby
Mad love, bring shoulders across through Time zones
Trying to catch a cyclone, you'll get your mind blown
I show them, how I attract, all shapes and sizes
All eyes is on whatever makes it rises
Once she come through, I'ma show you just what lumber do
You got a man, I'll your the pencil and your number too
It's all the same wherever you go
Whores is whores, foes is foes, pros is pros
Yeah y'all niggaz know
From East to West it's all the same
Once they hit the mattress, bitches catching dyslexia
Screaming my name, backwards, Usa, Usa ohh

[Outro: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Ain't that so? 
Umm, now I done been around the world and ayeh yah yah
Yeah, I done had some bad bitches and I can't deny
I had some bitches in New York, some Puerto Rican bitches
Puerto Rico, hey, Puerto Rico 
Come on!! Puerto Rico, hey, hey Puerto Rico
That's what the pussy said When I got up outta it, that felt good
I've even had some whores in D.C. - you know what I'm saying? 
Some college whores, I had some whores down South
Umm yeah southern hospitality
I even had some whores up north, in Vallejo
Gotta say what's up to all my Vallejo whores
I even had some whores down in Idaho
Gotta say what's up to all my Idahoes
Oui, I mean I even had some whores overseas
The pussy was, pussy was, pussy was, pussy was the bomb
We got off (echoes)</pre>
