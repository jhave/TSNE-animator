Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Megan Rochell]
We both know, that our love will grow
And forever, will be you and me...

[Method Man]
Give me a woman that get down for me, my one and only
That don't fuss or fuck around on me, or leave me lonely
Not just a honey, but a homey, just wanna hold me
Cuz she got alotta love for me, and put it on me
If I need that, plus she understand me when I beat that
It's sweet like candy, this time, I might just eat that
You steal my heart, sweetheart, then you can keep that
Let's bar hop and find us a spot where we can chief at
Push the seats back, you got the kinda body niggaz beep at
Try to speak at, but get no feedback
Sophisticated, Miss Highly Edumicated
Living well, lady that made it, type of woman you stay with

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
Give me a queen that respects a "king", just like Coretta
Get everything except the ring, for worse or better
Even through the stormy weather, rain, sleet, snow
Whatever, see if it go down, we go together
Like Twix bars, ain't no problem that we can't fix, ma
You ain't gotta sugar my tank, or key the kid car
Cuz broken hearts leave big scars, when emotions get hit hard
Niggaz get drunk and hit the strip bar
But that ain't even ya man's style, even back as a manchild
That's where I stood, and where I stand now
I'm throwing rocks at your window pane
Trying to bang, girl, like injure pain, you know the game

[Chorus]

[Megan Rochell]
No matter what we go through (what we go through)
I'll be there for you (there for you)
I'll never let you down, I'll just hold you down, oh-oooh
No matter where we be (where we be)
I'll do it all again (all again)
The ups and down, I'll hold you down, oh-oooh

[Method Man]
Give me a woman that get down for me, my one and only
She don't fuss or fuck around on me, or leave me lonely
Not just a honey, but a homey, just wanna hold me
Cuz she got alotta love for me, and now I gotta
Lotta love for her, might even take a slug for her
And everywhere we go, pull out that red rug for her
Yeah, them back rubs in the bathtub, got me cleaning my act up
I'm ready to shack up, now that's love

[Megan Rochell]
Nobody can love you like me boy
I'll promise to be your only girl
Don't ever leave, just stay
You will be down for me, anyway
Ahhhhhhhhhh, you and me together, baby

[Chorus]</pre>
