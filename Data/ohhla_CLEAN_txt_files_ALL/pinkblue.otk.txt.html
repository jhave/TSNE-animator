[Andre 3000]
Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby
Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby

Miss lady
You could have been born a  little later but I don't care
So what if your head sports a couple of grey hairs
Same here, and actually I think that's funky
(In a Claire Huxtable type way)
Miss lady
It looks to me like you need a little juice in your life
So call me when that big ole house gets lonelyfied
And I'll teleport from here to there
You show me how it's supposed to be done
I'll make sure you have young fun

Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby
Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby

You're sophisticated
Just me and miss lady
You've got me talkin like a baby
You make me talk baby talk
She's so sophisticated
You make me talk baby talk
Just me and miss lady
She makes me talk baby talk
Got me talkin like a baby
Like ga ga and goo goo
Oh momma
You're so sophisticated
Make me talk baby talk
Just me and miss lady
You're so experienced
Got me talkin like a baby
Teach me somethin new
Teach me somethin new
You're sophisticated
Just me and miss lady
You got me talkin like a baby</pre>
