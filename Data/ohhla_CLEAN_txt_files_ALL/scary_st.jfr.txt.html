[Willow]
Daddy can you tell me a story?
[Will]
Oh you wanna hear a story? What kind of story you wanna hear baby?
[Willow]
A scary story

[VERSE 1]
Oh, ok
Once upon a time there was a kid who wanted nothin' more than to rhyme
Almost like he was born in the rhyme
He thought of his rhymes almost all of the time
And he fought with his mom
His school getting caught with his rhyme book
And he knew he shouldn't of took it there in the first place
At least he shouldn't of been sittin lookin there in her face with it
Teacher told him get it out of her class
Wicked witch, trick told him that's probably why you won't pass
Now if you shy you won't last but you're new
So underneath his breath before he left he said I'm a be richer then you
What you say? She said
What you mean? He said
Boy don't you play, she said
What you mean? He said. Damnit
Ten minutes later standin up in the principles office
Getting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking
And he was pissed he wasn't listening to his son
You testing me? You messin up again
You done boy

[CHORUS]
This is just a story about a young man comin up in the rap game
A real scary story
Went from rags to riches it has goblins in it haters and witches. Uh

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[VERSE 2]
First thing he did was find somebody to give him some money
He wasn't stupid but wasn't using his senses honey
The guy's he meant was a little shady, a little funny
But they gave him the money so they played the record company
It sounds silly but when he grew up in Philly rhymin wasn't what it is today
Deals wasn't a dime a dozen
Today every sister, uncle, or mom or cousin gotta record deal
But for real it wasn't like that then
As you could imagine when he started risin to fame and fortune he was
havin Started antagonizing the guy's he was with
At the same time he started realizing
The deal he got from them guys in his eyes didn't fly with size of his hits
He called a meeting to find a solution
He said I'm gettin beat out of my loot
And I'm not recording no more until we find a solution
The dude's said we found a solution its this .44
He ran for the door a little shaken
But the next day he found a lawyer, told him the situation
He said I'm breakin this contract for ya
He said how much the lawyer said I'm a charge you a quarter cause I like you
Just do me a favor
get your life in order
