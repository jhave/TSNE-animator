(Intro)
Love 'em all
Haha gotta be one of them Baby Blue joints
Turn it up a notch
Let me see them speakers rock
Choclair featuring Mr. Mims
Aiyo Mims, whos this joint going out to?

(Chorus)
This is for my street misses
The one's who like to creep misses
In the back seat of my jeep misses
This is for the haters (woooah)
The ones that floss with no doe
We loves them all you know how we love 'em all

(Choclair)
You know we say we wanna do is bring it to the streets
And realize that its too far
So wanna bring it where they are where they are
You all niggaz at home doin' dishes with their ma (yo)
Or back playin ball wit pa' I don't hate
But its love and im only gonna roll with real thugs
Who show love to niggas who came from nothing and rose above
Who broke their balls to be a star
Now they shine bright (no the stores got a brighter light)
See it's funny to me when people wanna go bad-talk-me
But in a few years they be puttin' chips in your skin
To get your ID
Yet you suckers wanna hate on me? (get your priorities right)
I don't fight I sit back with Cogn-i-ac
Spark the Cohiba bright, give you more
When it's a Sauve Dawg thing you been looking for ???
Chocs is the funk that'll stank
That pumps your radio
That pumps the G's into my bank
Take your whole 4, fuck the plank
Wookie niggas try to step up but Chocs he pulls rank
Chop you on tour, take your rewards
Your uniform's plain, your stripe's been torn
Reppin' for the T-O-R-O-N-T-O T Dot O Dot Dot (fades into Chorus)

(Chorus)
This is for my street misses
The one's who like to creep misses
In the back seat of my jeep misses
This is for the haters (woooah)
The ones that floss with no doe
We loves them all you know that we love 'em all (yo yo yo yo yo)

(Choclair)
I'm just trying to live
Only take what you trying to give
I won't wait, I'll just take for a ride in the 6
I won't wait, You ain't the only one I'm tryin' to hit
Plenty other chicks eyeing the whip (you know)
I'm gonna take 'em and scoop 'em up
Especially when the roof is up
Either hop in the coup or truck
It's all the same just dont play no games like
(Sean I really don't do this much)
I'm not a brandy man
I'm in your dreams like candy man
Plus, I only touch girls named Candyland
When im in candy land sweet enough to eat it up
Like candied yams, call me handy man
I never take chickits to tandy land
I never Hawk chicks like Atlanta man
I'll take a girl out on a family plan
Thats why these girls can't stand me mannn (fades)

(Chorus - repeat 2X)

This is for my ballars my hustlers
My my my brothers who like like my sisters
Who love it beneath the covers
For my thugs my soldiers who try to get them rovers
Who won't stop for nothin' you want hits we bust 'em

(Mr. Mims)
Now being the type of man that I am, I just
Don't coo wheather you come through with a crew
Makin' noise so they boost ya
Cause niggas just cruise for a loose
Cause they think what they drop is the shot like a shooter
But I ain't what you used to
I'm out for millions like I'm Brewster
T Dot T Dot
Watch out, the heat that we bring, Sauve Dawg spread your wings

(Chorus - repeat 3X)


(Outro)
Mims yeah private party 2
What's up y'all, It's gotta be Kid Kut the voice of the vibe
Check it out, the party's jumpin', ladies bumpin'
Fellas is havin a crazy time
So drop us a line at www.babybluesoundcrew.com
Cause you know we comin' to your town to get down
We get down c'mon (baby blue dog in backround)</pre>
