[Heavy D - intro]
Alright
This one goes out to all the lovers in the house, knowI'msayin?
I'm gonna express my feelings right about now
on the way I like to do things
T-R, bring it in

	[Chorus -sung]
	Is it good to you - I like it
	Is it good to you - Ooh I like it
	Is it good to you - I like it
	Is it good to you - Ooohooh boy

[Heavy D]
How would you feel if I worked you down?
Made your head spin like a merry-go-round
Take control like Charles In Charge
I really can't wait, let's stay in the garage
Oops, let me run as I get the whipped cream
Can't have ice cream without whipped cream
Plus an ice cube, to make you swing
My main man did it, eh do the right thing
C'mon let me tickle you in all the right places
Keep my eyes open while I watch ya make faces
Feelin quite dandy, comfortable and cozy
Let me draw the curtains cos my neighbours are nosey
So make a little room, here comes big daddy
Big like a truck, satisfyin like a Caddy
Many will call but the chosen are few
and all I wanna know, is it good to you?

	[Chorus - sung, (Heavy D)]
	Is it good to you - I like it
	Is it good to you - Ooh I like it    (Is it good to you)
	Is it good to you - I like it
	Is it good to you - Ooohooh boy

[Heavy D]
Make a move, make a move, my lollipop cutie
Lay down on the cover, let the Lover do his duty
It looks like rain, but rain doesn't matter
We can take time, hold hands and chit-chatter
And what about love? Love's a possibility
but let's make sure we share the same mentality
Close the door, dim the lights
Everything is okey-dokey, cos we set it alright
And how bout oil? Warm from the heat
I can slick ya body down from your head to your feet
Make ya smile from a simple kiss
Close your eyes and I'll grant your first wish
Open your arms and wrap me tight like a teddy bear
then take your fingers and run it thru my hair
Many will call but the chosen are few
but all I wanna know, is it good to you?

	[Chorus - sung, (Heavy D)]
	Is it good to you - I like it
	Is it good to you - Ooh I like it    (Is it good to you)
	Is it good to you - I like it
	Is it good to you - Ooohooh boy yeah (Yeeaah, lay back a little)

[Heavy D - bridge]
You know when we kiss
I really wanna make ya feel right now
I mean, is it good to you?
Cos believe me when I tell you, it feels good to me

[Heavy D]
Check it
Roll over my lover, the sun is beaming
The hot water's runnin and the bathroom's steaming
Champagne bottle in the corner half done
Room's still bright from the morning sun
Yeah, we're snuggled up now it's time to buckle up
So call me later cutie, and I'll pick you up
Many'll call but the chosen are few
and all I wanna know, is it good to you?

	[Chorus - sung, (Heavy D)]
	Is it good to you - I like it
	Is it good to you - Ooh I like it yeah (Is it good to you)
	Is it good to you - I like it
	Is it good to you - Ooohooh I like it yeah (Is it good to you)

	Is it good to you - I like it (I wanna know)
	Is it good to you - Ooh I like it yeah (Is it good to you)
	Is it good to you - I like it yeah (I'd like to know)
	Is it good to you - You got me singin oooohhhh.....
