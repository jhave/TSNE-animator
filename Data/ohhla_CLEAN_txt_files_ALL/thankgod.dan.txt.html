Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ain't no more food stamps, man they been stopped that
Give it to you on the card if you follow these steps
And my girl got one, mean we gon' eat good
A week out the month mean we gon' be full
And it's so hard, we depend on that
But who cares if generic brands in the cabinet?
So I'mma hit the hood, and see what's up though
Maybe try to cop some gan, hopefully I serve some custos
But if it don't work, I ain't gon' trip
Cause when my girl get off of work we got to hit the market
And I got to help her with the boxes out the car
Yeah boxes, boxes out the car
And it might sound hard but the stakes so soft
And I love the way she cook, hook the rice up with the broth
Yeah, pour another glass of pop y'all
And thank God for a Bridge Card

[Chorus x2]
Let's bow our heads, hold hands, and thank God
Let's hit the market my baby and go hard
Let's hit Save A Lot and we can buy it all
Thank God for a Bridge Card (hey!)

They say the hood starving, but we be eating
Frying wing dings with the fake Lawry seasoning
Yeah Larry's, but it's still good though
Just one swipe, we barbecuing in the hood, bro
Eating cheese doodles, don't let the size fool you
Tonight we eating shrimp, take a break from the noodles
Yeah, and you know we out of place
When welfare the only thing that put a smile on her face
So baby cook some breakfast, I need my energy
I hit the block fresh, time to serve these fiends
Just trying to catch sales, you know how I do
And she got the WIC Card, so that's mad Juicy Juice
And I pipe her, call me the plumber
Even let me hit the store, told me her PIN number
Took the kids with me, told 'em go hard
Yeah, and thank God for a Bridge Card

[Chorus x2]
Let's bow our heads, hold hands, and thank God
Let's hit the market my baby and go hard
Let's hit Save A Lot and we can buy it all
Thank God for a Bridge Card (hey!)</pre>
