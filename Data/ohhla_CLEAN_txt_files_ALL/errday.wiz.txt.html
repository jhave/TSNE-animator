Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa (Juicy J)]
Foreign cars, that's errday
A million off a tour, that's errday
Hundred broads, that errday
Gettin' this money livin' large in every way
(Smokin' dope) that's errday
(Run through yo doors) that's errday
(Pullin' hoes) that's errday
(Get money mo') that's errday
(Smokin dope) that's errday
(Run through yo doors) that's errday
(Pullin' hoes) that's errday
(Get money mo') that's errday

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Rappin' ass nigga
There go Wiz he a rappin' ass nigga
I'm in a Benz gettin' brain from a centerpiece
Before you can mention my name I need 10 at least
I know they hate 'cause of the paper that a nigga see
Light a J and say a prayer for my enemies
Yeaa, made men, bunch of made ass niggas
When you paid then you with some paid ass niggas
I heard that money grow on trees so I grew one
Left my old bitch at home, got a new one
Said that I quit drinking but I'm back at it
I said that I quit drinking but I'm back at it
Yo bitch leaving with us nigga that's tragic
The roof go in the trunk that's magic
She rollin' weed and she don't even smoke
Come to your job and make it flood you goin' need a boat

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa (Juicy J)]
Foreign cars, that's errday
A million off a tour, that's errday
Hundred broads, that errday
Gettin' this money livin' large in every way
(Smokin' dope) that's errday
(Run through yo doors) that's errday
(Pullin' hoes) that's errday
(Get money mo') that's errday
(Smokin dope) that's errday
(Run through yo doors) that's errday
(Pullin' hoes) that's errday
(Get money mo') that's errday

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I'm 20 years in and I still win
Hangin' with the Taylors drinkin' Gin and I'm dancin'
Sunday I will ride the Bugatti, Monday I ride Benz
Any chick and all of her friends you know I'm tossin'
Big money spend, lil' money fold
You got 1 grill, Juicy got 4
Only club that I like gotta have poles
Only fuck with model chicks but I play with hoes
My mansion sittin' on 40 acres, who the neighbors?
Kobe Bryant from the Lakers, now that's paper
An Aston Mar' through the hood I don't need no waiver
'Cause if you niggas get wrong, I'm a see you later
Blaooow, blaoow, bloaw

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa (Juicy J)]
Foreign cars, that's errday
A million off a tour, that's errday
Hundred broads, that errday
Gettin' this money livin' large in every way
(Smokin' dope) that's errday
(Run through yo doors) that's errday
(Pullin' hoes) that's errday
(Get money mo') that's errday
(Smokin dope) that's errday
(Run through yo doors) that's errday
(Pullin' hoes) that's errday
(Get money mo') that's errday</pre>
