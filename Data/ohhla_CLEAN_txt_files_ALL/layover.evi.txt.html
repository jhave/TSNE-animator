Not a worry in the world when I started
Still young and restless
Hurry up and wait
Tell my people nowadays a missed call is just as good as a message
Weve come along way from brick phones to flip phones
I remember the day my homie Freck-one had the first chip phone
We was callin long distance runnin up corporations tabs
Like god damn the world gone mad
And little did I know and did he know we was not gonna
see the future together now here no more (rest in peace) 
93 was not til infinity, 93 was more like 20 years of legacy 
In Venice Beach, Santa Monica, Freck-One ring bells
Jade-one they know the name well still 
They goin huntin 
Theres 8 million stories in the city
They forgot the 4 million in the country
I'm going where the people want me

(Worldwide)

Uh
This is the layover
airport hanger 6 hours with a hangover
I bang over the best when I fly we goin ride
Got my peoples on my side
Its to the sky 

(Worldwide)

Lets call the whole thing off
Nah I call your bluff
If you callin it luck
I'm up to no good, I'm up to something
I'm plottin my peoples still come first I never pass the buck
I never asked for nothing I couldnt get back even during set backs
I called everyday your doughs on the way
When it comes I'ma put something on top make sure you get that (with interest)
Dont forget about the rain the suns up now
But when its wet I'm back in my lane 
Dont forget about the pain
I ain't been the same since April 04
This shit is insane not a game this a limited run
Dont second guess an operation from an armchair son of a gun
Loudest in the room ain't the smartest in the building
Quitting while I'm ahead ain't the same as quitting is it?
