"Don't be a good neighbour to her
I'll send a love letter
Straight from my heart, fucker!
You know what a love letter is
It's a bullet from a fuckin' gun, fucker!
You receive a love letter from me
And you're fucked for ever"

[All]
L to the O to the V to the E, love!

[B-Real]
Is the word that I'm thinking of
Sometimes I sit back and try to figure it out
How it can break the strongest man down 
To his very last compound
I took a fall 'cause I went out for the love
That I shared with a woman who didn't care
I tried to give her my all and change my shit up
But she didn't give a fuck about that when she decided to get up
Fuck all the good time, just remember the bad
Fuck me and fuck all the love we used to have
Chillin' at the clubs, your friends and my friends
Hangin' out all night, driving around in the Benz
Fuckin' off all my ends but I can't pretend
Not fell the pain inside, suicide crossed my mind 
Every time I heard your name
But I got strong and realized it's all about the game
Now you're all just the same

Chorus: [All]
L to the O to the V to the E, love!
L to the O to the V to the E
L to the O to the V to the E, love!
L to the O to the V to the E

[Duke]
Fuck love, I just can't get enough of your freaky ass baby
Sexy mothafucka, when you walk by and I wanna go for a ride
You hit like drugs, or red wine I'm blind
Drivin' through your world sky high
Flyin' through your town like wind sex triangle
Circels of his begin, spinnin' I'm happy grinnin'
Sufferin' over pussy I'm fuckin'
He's stuck like a truck and I'm like you
Scandalous slut what's up
Where's your man probably with the puta that says she loves me
My heart grows cold and hard as stone
Time goes by and the last laugh is mine
