[Daz whispering]
This nigga to give it all to me with the cut
*door knocking*

[Kurupt]
Get the door

[Daz Dillinger]
Yo wassup? What you need?
Hmm? Yeah
I'm out

Hop in the '6-3 Chevy, countin boutin the heat
Scapin thru the streets with my niggas bumpin hellafied beats
See us, niggas play for keeps, kill the strong and the weak
&gt;From the Eastside of Long Beach, that's 2-1 Street
See we, live and die by the gun and the knife
And I, high as a kite, corrallin thru the night
Haha, stackin hundreds, we kept the drugs and hoes comin (Come on)
Young gunnin, tortured, no need to be punished (Yeah)
All we have of the system is big cabbage
Lifestyles is lavish, livin my life from Dallas
It was a challenge, livin my life like a savage
To have or to not to have it or nobody can have it
Un-touch-able, inde-struct-able
Get in my way and we're dustin you
As a kid this the type of shit that we dreamed of
Money, cars, bitches and drugs
I prevail, the crack sales then got in jail
Couldn't post bail now my home is livin in a cell
Thirty years with no parole as I grow old
You won't see me on the streets til I'm 60 years old

Chorus: Daz singing

Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
do we live in dangerous lives?
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
It's just the gangsta life we live
Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
do we live in dangerous lives?
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
It's just the gangsta life we live

[Warren G]
It's the A, Team, operation regime
Money and dreams got me hooked with schemes
&gt;From the Time Square walk to America's best
Long Beach is the spot, got a lot of respect
Cos I'm a vet, regulate and never hesitate
I stay hungry so fill my plate
I'm just a young black nigga tryin to flip an end
Five year probation, nigga fuck the pen
Whattup, Uncle Kev doin eight upstate
I heard you're benchin ten plates, knockin out inmates
It's just a way of life, nigga shootin the dice
Now you hit all craps, now you payin the price
Livin the thuggish life

Chorus:

Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
do we live in dangerous lives?
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
It's just the gangsta life we live
Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
do we live in dangerous lives?
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
It's just the gangsta life we live, we live, we live

[Kurupt]
G, Dove, we, mob
Killin all y'all, that is our job
And if you thought it was The Gang then you hit it on the knob
Slide and flip like cocoa bricks, takin your 6
and leavin it on the side of the freeway on bricks
Schitzomanic, automatic, schizophrenic, six
It's just a psychosomatic, original
Dogg Pound criminal, ya ever heard of me?
Kurupt, Young Gotti, motherfucker D-P
Why is life fucked up? Toe-up
scrapin from the flo' up to the ceilin, the fo's bust
for my children to grow
We live to let go, nigga

Chorus/Outro:

Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
do we live in dangerous lives?
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
It's just the gangsta life we live
Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
do we live in dangerous lives?
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
It's just the gangsta life we live

Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
do we live in dangerous lives?
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
It's just the gangsta life we live
Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
do we live in dangerous lives?
	[Snoop] It's only for the money
It's just the gangsta life we live, we live, we live</pre>
