[Woodie]
As I'm 'bout to blow up
Your knot and barrel fuck your brains
I kinda take in a back
And think about how things changed
We used to be homies
You flipped the script and now we rivals
I hear you gettin' punked fuckin' with them outsidaz
A ridah you?  
Hell naw more like a bitch
You's a non loyall backstabbing cowardly snitch
My homies [?] fighting 25 to life for doin' dirt
So dont try to deny it sucka
He's got you paper worked
Should of kept you homies tight  
And played your cards right
Instead you try to be that baller
End up owin' your life
And ain't no thang for me to rearange
Your friends of L.A.
The Yoc [??] pretains
So I maintain on the names
And everything has gone strange
But I'm still up in this shit
Even though my gang's diminished
To a five member click
And Blackbird is gone
But you never know how long
That muthafucka might just creep up
Leavin' two in your dome
And it's on

[Chorus]
Blackbird is gone
But the funk don't stop
As I'm 'bout to blow up
Your knot and barrel fuck your brains
Blackbird is gone
But the funk don't stop
As I'm 'bout to blow up
Your knot and barrel fuck your brains
We used to be homies
But you a rat infested rodent
As I'm 'bout to blow up
Your knot and barrel fuck your brains
We used to be homies
You flipped the script and now we rivals

[Lil' Los]
As my mind falls blind
To a cloud of smoke
Stroke chambers with my fingers and hope
Dirty blood spills tonight
Nine mills spit tight, hit right
Make your fade
When I set the flight
Good night, I reen
I mean not dreams
When I let loose
Induce 16 in your spleen
And produce another murder scene
My bullets fiend the teams of scream
From an auto machine
And put your ass to sleep, tweak
When I creep, peep
These sticky situations
Conceration's what I'm facin'
But there's no hesitations
When I relieve frustrations
The case is huh
You bruised my pride
But I refuse to loose
So I'll choose to ride my side
My folks no joke
Leave you smoked, toked no doubt
And I [?] move that you choose
[????] single doubt
Man there's lessons to be learned [learned]
Tables to be turned [turned]
Treason is the reason  
For our bridges being burned
Scraps earn when our hollow tips drip
From the clip bitch
No shit, when my twist spits
And wipe you off my hitlist
And witness a bigness
And homies that will witness
At one time, but fuck why
He'll switch up with quickness
Your rediculous
And giving Northern Cal a bad name
Homies gonna get some grain
Damn shit's gone strange

[Chorus]

[Woodie]
Blackbird is gone
But the funk don't stop

[Lil' Los]
Homies gonna get some grain
Damn shit's gone strange</pre>
