Ohhhhhhhhhhh.. I like the party life!
The city in bright lights
Little girls dressed in the skintight

[Jay-Z over samples]
Break out the red lights, welcome to the party life
Welcome to the 70's... sah-wweet~!

[Jay-Z]
Ordered some Patreezy, while talkin to this breezy
Brushin off my three-piece, I make this look too easy
So tall and lanky; my suit, it should thank me
I make it look, good to be this hood Meyer Lansky
Mixed with Lucky Lefty, gangster effortlessly
Papa was a rolling stone it's in my an-ces-try
I'm in a whole 'nother league, niggaz never catch me
And I sport fly shit, I should win the ESPY

[samples]
When you're blue, and got nothin to do
Welcome to the party life
If you're feelin low, we got to see the glow
Head into the party life

[Jay-Z over samples]
Hehehehe... baby I said I-I sport, fly shit
I should win the Espy
I'm really in another league, babe
I got a slick mouth, you might wanna roll with me

[Jay-Z]
I'm on the bra strap, she's on my dick
Ain't nothin' wrong with that, that's my biiitch!
I be the boss of that, I'm on her shiiit
So all you niggaz fall back, I'll split ya wiiig
She's my little quarterback - ya dig?
Cause I'm all that in the sack; yeah, ya dig?
I spoiled her, foiled it if you fakin jax
She's used to million dollar vacations
Fuck y'all gon' do with that?

[samples]
When you're blue, and got nothin to do
Welcome to the party life
If you're feelin low, we got to see the glow
Get into the party life

[Jay-Z over samples]
Ay baby, see
When you're used to filet mignon
It's kinda hard to go back to Hamburger Helper
It's your choice though baby
Head into the party life

[Interlude]
(Is you rollin, rollin, rollin)
Yeah, baby, is you rollin?
{Head into the party life}
You can stall out or ball out
(Is you rollin, rollin, rollin)
Make a choice
{Headin-headin to the party life}
It's so gangster, baby

[Jay-Z]
Sippin on my vino got me cooler than Pacino
and DeNiro put together my real life is like "Casino"
They should pay me for some B-roll
Takin G-strokes through the ghee-to
When rap-pap-pap-pid fire's just a neccesary evil
Hola Ho-vi-to, cooler than ze-ro
Be-low, fresh one blade, no chemo
Art with no easel, please it;s no equal
Your boy's "Off the Wall" these other niggaz is Tito

[samples]
Ohhhhhhhhhhh.. I like the party life!
The city in bright lights
Little girls dressed in the skintight

[Jay-Z over samples]
DAMN~! Ay baby I said I'm
I'm "Off the Wall" I'm like a young Michael Jackson
These other niggaz is Tito
Shout out to Randy, hehehehe
Real talk!

[samples]
When you're blue, and got nothin to do
Welcome to the party life
If you're feelin low, we got to see the glow
Head into the party life

[Jay-Z over samples]
I'ma just let this ride out
I might let it ride out for like seven minutes
You can groove to it, whatever
Get your two step - AOWWW!
Guru, turn the lights down
Let's keep it smooth
This that shit you roll up, like a lil' tight J to
Sip your lil' wine, whatever your vice is y'know
Whatever you like to do
Get into your comfort zone baby, get into yo' comfort zone

[samples]
When you're blue, and got nothin to do
Welcome to the party life
If you're feelin low, we got to see the glow
Head into the party life

[Jay-Z over samples]
Head into the party life
I don't even want it to stop though, f'real though

[Jay-Z]
Step into my bedroom, I, call it the red room
Cau-cause it gets hot hot hot hot...
I trust you gon' like it; see, why are we talkin all this fly shit?
Cau-cau-cau-cau-cau-cause I'm the flyest
Hovito, baby, no equal, baby
Sold perico, beat the RICO, now I'm leg-al ba-by
Hovito, baby, no equal, baby
Sold perico, beat the RICO, now can we go crazy

[samples]
When you're blue, and got nothin to do
Welcome to the party life
If you're feelin low, we got to see the glow
Head into the party life
