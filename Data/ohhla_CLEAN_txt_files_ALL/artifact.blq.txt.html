(The LOX)
Is you doing the sticking or is you getting stuck
Is you doing the fucking, or is you getting fucked
And that's REAL

(Styles P) (Hook)
It aint a game no more its a sport
If you aint got heart to play then stay off da court 3x

(Jadakiss)
It's the life shit, raised in a crisis
Love is priceless, respect tightness
React on the night shift
If it wasn't for the flow, I'd probably have to double back
Bubble crack, see my niggas floating in the bubble ac(ura)

(Styles P)
That's logical, psychological, diabolical
Leave you in the hospital, remarkable
When you write the Butta they be mocking you
Clocking you, rocking jewels they think of poppin you
Think of poppin them, ask young bloods and pop and them
I be watching them, rocking them
With the Butta bars, it's the LOx and them

(Jadakiss)
We touch judges and tease DA's to be beat cases
And squash beef with erasers, change paces
Back and forth for bad urine, it's getting boring
It's especially when I'm blowing before court in the morning
The Jew lawyer, the true employeer
That will destroy ya defense like the Hoyas
Linen suit with a mean goya
Who stand by my side while the bailiff screams out "Court in Order"

(Styles P)
Nigga, move your feet, lose your seat
We in it for the cream of wheat and everybody's gotta eat
You on chow line, we got the last piece of meat
Getting bailed about twelve, right back up on the street
Crushed rocks on my neck, plush under my feet
I be on some life shit, til God put me to sleep

(Chorus)
Huh, we on some life shit
Niggas on the right shift
My whole camp keep it tightness with vice grips
And I ain't going out God with the light switch
Cause when I'm gone I ain't going out like this 

(Sheek)
Who me? I never wanted to be a doctor or an architech
Fuck a lawyer, since 8 I wanted to be a drug connect
With fast dough, for teen, I push the palm green Milano
Rocking top designos, hitting chicks but never loving
A Willie, what made me like this? 
I feel in love with cuban icesis  
Taking my pops advice, stacking dough from doing heists
Flossing bubbles, my shorty, she keep the Marquis
At the Garden drinking beer next to Spike Lee
My staff holding, we out here trying to lock it
No doubt I keep a grave yard in my fatigue pocket
Of dead presidencies, my street game is thorough
Ask the Willies in the borough, LOX getting that Deniro
For real

(Rufus Blaq)
I know how it is, every sec you gotta show up to court
Robbing every spot you see to make child support
Eating every meal slow, cherishing every bite
Putting pelish on your Nikes cause your shit ain't tight
We be running scams just to see your mobs in some minks
We don't care what society thinks
And I ain't trying to do time cause prison ain't good for my health
But if I got 25, fuck hanging myself
Nuff respect to the niggas making money however
Cause it's hard trying to live without the mozzeralla
Cheddar, cheese, that's what that bes
Certain things you need, necessities to slang kis
Accumulate a hundred Gs, keep your eyes on your stash
Cause you could miss something important from watching ass
And you ain't hitting to it, never front like you hard
Niggas will strip that ass naked, have you fucking a dog
Is you doing the sticking or is you getting stuck
Is you doing the fucking, or is you getting fucked
And that's REAL

(Styles P) (Hook)
It aint a game no more its a sport
If you aint got heart to play then stay off da court 4x

Stay off the court, stop balling, retire nigga</pre>
