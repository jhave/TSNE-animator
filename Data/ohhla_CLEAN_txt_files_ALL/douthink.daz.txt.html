Typed by: fywhla@yahoo.com

[Chorus] - X 2
Do you think about me?
(Yes I think about you)
Do I think about you?
(Well I hope you do)
Because I never met a type of thug
that love me the way you do

[Daz Dillinger]
Do you think about me, do I think about you?
Love the way you fuck me girl, yeah I'm talkin' 'bout you
Ride the dick up and down baby, make that sound
This for you and every girl lookin' good in the town
Music bumpin', now we humpin' to the beat, now the booty all mine
As we fondle through the sheets, so sweet
Bodies heatin', now I sweat 'cause I ain't done yet
I bust 1-2-3, just out of respect
She licked my neck, we connect, Diggy Daz is a vet
I'm fuckin' the pussy 'cause nigga yo I'm killin' this shit
From the back, side to side, 'til the sun start to rise
Just before you know, huh, I'm back in them thighs
Goin' "ah, ah" tryin' to catch that feelin'
Cause I love the way you do it, sincerely Daz Dilli
Come on and do it just like, girl get wit it
And this for them pretty pretty girls that's in the city

[Chorus] - X 2
Do you think about me?
(Yes I think about you)
Do I think about you?
(Well I hope you do)
Because I never met a type of thug
that love me the way you do

[Daz Dillinger]
Dark skinned and light skinned, yo I'm all up in it
Just let me hit it, let me make it hot from the beginnin'
Bend it over, let me show you how Diggy's supposed to -
fuck that pussy when a nigga come over
Hard as a boulder, let me grab your shoulder
Been waitin' for this pussy girl, now you're older
Lay with a nigga, won't you blaze up a blunt
I wanna give it to you girl, just like you want
No need to front, slow and fast when I pump
Baby girl let me tell you, this ain't no stunt
Squeeze it tight, make it right, give it to me all night
Yo we drunk, feelin' buzzed 'cause we high as a kite
Give it to ya five minutes 'cause she started to suck it
Can't go wrong so I puts on rubber
Cut it open like mamba, you start to wonder
Cause I make it hot like July summer

[Chorus] - X 4
Do you think about me?
(Yes I think about you)
Do I think about you?
(Well I hope you do)
Because I never met a type of thug
that love me the way you do</pre>
