Clinton Clinton Clinton Clinton Sparks
"Hold on there, hey you!  Wait a minute"

[Nature]
It's nuttin new, I started with Steve Stoute
'Round the same time B.I.G. first put Cease out

[Noreaga]
Same thing, but I started with Penalty
"L.A., L.A." the West coast was the enemy

[Nature]
But we still found a way to link up with Dre

[Noreaga]
And recorded The Firm album, out in L.A.
Now that shit squashed

[Nature] Got guns in the strip bars
[N.O.R.] Stay on rims faster than you get your shit squashed
[Nature] Y'all lil' niggaz ain't cut like that
[N.O.R.] You niggaz move out the hood then you move right back

[Nature]
And get surprised when we move like crack and amphetamines
No more chocolate, smokin on the better greens

[Noreaga]
Yeah, from Flint Michigan to Pensacola Florida
Got a shorty borrow her, and I bail horror

[Nature] Yeah, wind and rain like back to back hurricanes
[N.O.R.] Ivan and Francis, feelin like it's hurra same

[Chorus: repeat 8X]
[N.O.R.] Load it, cock it, aim it, let it go

[Noreaga]
Funk I had to smash I'ma smash back
I got a elevator in the crib, cause I got a bad back

[Nature]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, premier after scared as "Fear Factor"
Niggaz cannot see me clearly with glasses

[Noreaga]
Ha, so you niggaz moved back from the boss
Dat dat, dat, da-dat's when you're lost!

[Nature] Check his medical reports and the dental files
[N.O.R.] All you need is one-two for a simple smile
[Nature] I've got a shorty givin brains so I'm always gon' brain her
[N.O.R.] And man I'm gettin fat I'm 'bout to hire me a trainer
[Nature] Fuck a low carb
[N.O.R.] Cause now I'm like pro-God
[N.O.R.] Fuck a diet nigga cause I'd rather get a blow job

[Nature]
I got a gun but don't need to use it
Fuckin up the world like Serena losin

[N.O.R.] Load it, cock it, aim it, let it go
[N.O.R.] Load it, cock it, aim it, let it go

[Chorus]</pre>
