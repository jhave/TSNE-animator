Ahh in the motherfuckin house!
This is the Pretty Tone Capone
And I'm here with my motherfuckin man, motherfuckin Apache
And don't give a fuck!
Here to let you motherfuckers know how to make money
So whassup with that?  Loot for your pocket troop!
Y'knowhatI'msayin?  Wouldn't you rather be a rich bitch
than a fuckin broke hoe?  So bitches listen up
and take heed to the motherfuckin word

[Apache]
Yo I sleep all day, stay up all night scramblin
My palms got an itch, fuck a bitch, time for gamblin
Cee-lo, 4-5-6 with the quickness
Flip trips, flip your script, and dump on my shitlist
I doubt if you got the clout to outlast
Time to get money, don't make me crack a can of whip-ass
I'm kind of shady - rugged relentless and rude
I'm cessted, drunk, plus I'm in a real fucked up mood
Since the dough is low and the arsenal's thick
I got a few tricks, I'm quick to pick a vic'
Pick 'em up, time to stick 'em up it ain't funny
Listen honey I want MO' MONEY MO' MONEY
Make a move, try to swing, I knew you wasn't
Wanna live God forgives Apache doesn't
So to borrow 'til tomorrow just find a car shop
Pop the lock then drop it off at the chop spot
Like Robin Hood, no fuckin good, that's what you wanted
Instead of robbin the rich, I rob my bitch then go get blunted
My pockets are gettin thicker quicker I want more
Here's the scoop troop, more loot than a money store
If you're broke, shut the fuck up (HO!!!!)
I thought so - and I don't need a break hoe
Speakin of hoes and dough, they know how to spend it
Ladies listen up, let me talk to you for a minute, c'mon

[Lady]
Yo wait, hold the fuck up
Yo Apache, how the fuck you gonna tell the niggaz how to get dough
and not tell the BITCHES how to get some money?
The fuck is wrong with you, you crazy or somethin?

[Apache]
Here's a few ways to get paid, proceed with caution
Tell your man you need money for an abortion
Check his pockets while sleep, creep, don't get caught
Don't want him to take back all the shit he already bought
Keep a stash, strictly cash, and think hard
See somethin you like?  Fuck it, put it on his credit card
Tell me who do you prefer, a man or a mack?
On the flip-flop, don't stop to shop at Jack's
With sex appeal, be real I don't understand
fake hair and nails, and you're lookin for a real man
Some dance for dollars, holla cause I know you know
cause some plain old hoes just FUCK for dough
Use your imagination, why think small
Instead of takin half, fuck it, why not take it all?
Don't be a dumb broad, a fraud, a phony
You just end broke, no blunt to smoke, and lonely
Use your pussy as a tool, that's how you want it G
Don't waste it, put it on sale, but never free
Fuck your way to the top, don't be a slob
If none of that shit works, then fuck it, buy the job
It takes more to be a rich bitch with big tits
If your man is broke, don't listen to his bullshit
Speakin of men, we know how to make the money
But it's up to you to take it honey

[Pretty Tone Capone]
Word to mother my motherfuckin man just told you what you had to do
So if you wanna just lay back and be blazed
you'll damn sure play the fool
You think we won't fuck the shit out of you bitches?
You better get real, word to mother
What the fuck's up, what the fuck is goin on with that shit?
A crook is 'sposed to have his hand in your motherfuckin pocketbook
Play yourself out
