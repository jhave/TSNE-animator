Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Uncle Kracker]
The days seem so familiar
There's something about the evenings
Even though they change every now and then

[Kenny Chesney]
Well I can be myself here
I can free myself here
I can't believe it's last night again

I see things go down
I hear the talk of the town
Like an echo in my ear
If you should look for me
I'll be right here
I can leave myself here
Or I could use some help here
I can't believe it's last night again

[Kenny Chesney]
It's a lonesome sound when this bar shuts down
So I guess I'll have one more
Nothin' out there I ain't seen before

I can leave myself here
I could use some help here
I can't believe it's last night again
I can't believe it's last night again
I can't believe it's last night again</pre>
