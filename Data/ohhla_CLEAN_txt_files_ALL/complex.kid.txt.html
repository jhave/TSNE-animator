I need somebody won't you help me
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am
I've been livin a lie so long it seems I've lived a life time
If you could see what I feel it would make your ghetto lood like heaven 
And I believe it stems down from my family situation
I never liked my old man
I couldn't stand to be around him 
Sometimes I sit all alone just starin at his picture, yeah
My heart turns to stone and I think of this 

I need somebody won't you help me
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am
You never loved me, you never held me tight
Instead you shook me like a beast to wake me up at night 
You tried to make me think that your ways were best
When all I was was an outlet for all your stress 

Life it's the ultimate sin
A game with no rules that you're expected to win 
My personal hell's hidden with a grin 
Dad take the stand and let the trial begin
You said that oil and water don't mix though it seems cool
Keep with your own and don't fuck up our gene pool 
UYoushould've went to school like your bigger brother
But you played the fool with a different color 
Runnin' ship with a whip
I tried to keep up but I kept getting tripped 
Money made you so wise
How could you look thru my face and not see your own eyes 
Do as I say and not as I do
But I can't cuz when I look in the mirror I see you
And oh the pain how it hurts
It was always your home and your business that came first 
You said a man is as good as his word
But your mind was closed and mine never heard 
My visions blurred, thoughts obscured
And with my blinders down I strain from the heard
They say the nut don't fall far from the tree
Look at u then look at me... 

You ain't nothin to me you've never been to me
And all you ever gave a damn about was money see 
So now fuck you man you ain't shit to me
And it's the day that I die of this hate that I'm free 

Now I know growin up son that it ain't always been easy
And I know at times I was not always there for you 
No we never spent much time just talkin or havin a good time
But understand growin up son I never had a dime 
So I worked my ass off and I put myself through college
And everything I have to this day u know I built it all 
Oh I wish I could go back and change the years that's lost between us
I wish I could take back some of the things I said to you 
Son I said I'm sorry but still you resent me so
Son I said I'm sorry and why do you resent me so

I always loved you I always cared for you
Just never wanted you to go through what I've been through 
I tried to raise my fuckin family just the best I know
And now I'm hated like the devil and for why I don't know 
Dahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Alright, get down baby
Yeaaaaahhhhhhh

I need somebody won't you help me
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am 
I need somebody please, please help me
I need somebody you must tell me who I am

Hey, hey, hey
Tell me who I am
Hey, hey
Tell me who I am
I am, I am
Tell me who I am, am, am
Tell meeeee
Tell meeeee

If it looks good, you'll see it...
If it sounds good, you'll hear it...
If it's marketed right, you'll buy it...
But if it's real, you'll feel it...</pre>
