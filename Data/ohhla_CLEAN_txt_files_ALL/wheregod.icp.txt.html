Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Innocent... folks
Innocent... folks
Folks..
Innocent... folks
Innocent... folks
Folks..
Innocent folks wrong place at the wrong time
Doing bids or drawn in a chalk line, little kids crossing the bridge too young
Some tortured before they come, {damn}
Evil is here, the boogie man too
You  don't own a gun, man you should plan to
Am I looking at shxt negatively
Crib death mom ain't got shxt left
How the fxck is shxt fair out here
Homeless family froze on the stairs, where's God bumping his ipod
It's odd, I'll be the lightning rod
I wanna know
Where's God? {pitiful that}
Where's God?
Where's God, when shxt goes down?i wanna know
Where's God? {pitiful that}
Where's God?
Where's God, when shxt goes down? {it ain't right}
Are we all be tested fail me then
So much fxcked up shxt where to begin
Some kids are born with a silver spoon
Others born with a needle &amp; a world of doom
Little girl found duct taped &amp; raped, &amp; the killer escaped God give me a break
I want to keep believing but it's a struggle
Let Jake &amp; jack jeckel juggle
Drunk drivers killing Iraq survivors,  he can't interfere, then why's he here?
After years of feeling like nobody cares
Most of us switch gears on Him, Cheers
Cheers..
Where's God? {pitiful that}
Where's God?
Where's God, when shxt goes down? {it ain't right} cheers..
Where's God? {pitiful that}
Where's God?
Where's God, when shxt goes down? {it ain't right}
Children fire, everybody dies
As a preacher explains &amp; I roll my eyes
This game tryin' to make sense of madness
For a ray of hope in a world of sadness
I get it,  we all need hope to cope
But collection plate money goes to dope
I cling by a finger &amp; I'll admit it
Most of it is bullshxt, &amp; I don't get it
If he was up there chillin'
Lettin' this happen
Doin' nuttin'
He'd be in need of a slappin'
But we're all clueless to how it works
There are no experts &amp; that's what hurts
Where's God? {pitiful that}
Where's God? {we need Him here} where's God, when shxt goes down? {it ain't right}
Where's God? {pitiful that}
Where's God? {we need Him here}
Where's God, when shxt goes down? {it ain't right}

"There's not an individual who's ever confessed Christ
who has not but one time or another, said the wrong thing
thought the wrong thing, done the wrong thing, &amp; I don't care how saved you are"

Where's God? {pitiful that}
Where's God? {we need Him here}
Where's God, when shxt goes down? {it ain't right}
Where's God? {pitiful that}
Where's God? {we need Him here}
Where's God, when shxt goes down? {it ain't right}
{pitiful that}

I still believe...

It ain't right
Pitiful that
We need him here
It ain't right</pre>
