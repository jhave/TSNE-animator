Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Ever since the jet I have my own style
Did my own thing sold my own caine
What the fuck these niggas think? Money not trill?
East Atlanta Shawty, boy I'm too real
BMG the shit, we takin over things
And I don't wanna hear these niggas mention money name
I got a problem with me nigga come and check me then
I'mm be right here on this flap, I was born to win
I'll say yo ass a dummy in a heartbeat
So geeked off this molly I don't even go to sleep
I'm chastising niggas bout this fuckin paper
Kortney Money been a real money maker
Don't hear shit that you said cause you's a fuckin faker
You was raised around them haters, you don't got no paper
Nigga that's why you mad, Nigga that's why you mad
Cause street fuckin with me and we getting this cash

[Chorus: x2]
Word on the street  BMG the shit
And ya'll niggas playin but we run this shit
And we taking orders, nigga what you need?
Black Migo Gang, yea we run the streets

[Verse 2]
Word on the street  VL signed with Scooter
BMG we turnt, bitch we rappin but we shooters
Everywhere we go I ain't lyin, it's a movie
Snap 100 pictures, actin bad on the groupies
Truck load situation boy, fuck yo re-up
Pug out in little school, show you how to pull up
BM all the muscle, BMG the power
Thumbing through the check, boy I took a whole hour
Make hoes break they anckles, you make it rain, I make it shower
That astronaut status man, not Austin Powers

Word on the street  BMG the shit
And ya'll niggas playin but we run this shit

[Verse 3]
I'm not in the street, I'm in the streets
Word is that we're signing with streets
Flip birds just like Hermes
My diamonds yo can't see
They go dumb just like Skreet
I cook up, I don't teach
Multiply yo salary
That ain't even half for me
Got a boat load, got a truck load
Got a new plug  that a cargo
And I don't have to touch it
Once you seein it's already sold
BMG in beast mode
Swing sweals for a tip-toe
Choppa chop yo body
Yo best thing is to get low

[Bridge]
It don't make dollars, don't make sense
Word on the street you just pay yo rent
I just thought you ain't know, gotta test this shit
Word on the street  they say it ain't over with
Black Migo Gang, we can make some plans
We don't sell them A1, we got remix
I got plug ties with Columbians
I'm black amigo school but the cross the line to Mexicans

[Chorus]
Word on the street  BMG the shit
And ya'll niggas playin but we run this shit
And we taking orders, nigga what you need?
Black Migo Gang, yea we run the streets</pre>
