Album:  The Drought Is Over Pt. 4
Song:   Breakin My Heart
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hey baby look here, I got this new song I wrote
it's got that nice slow groove that everybody dancin to
and when I play it, it kinda remind me of me and you
I mean, there's one more thing I want to talk about
It's time for you to come home, everybody got their problems
I'm dealing with mine
I done gave up them narcotics, I'm a changed man

[Bridge]
She loves me, she loves me not.

[Verse 1: Little Brother]
How many ways can I say I'm done fishin
You wanted the role, smash the audition
Havin a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen
Still I got a taste for that fast food, foreign cars, many women
And some say it's the life I was given
I say it don't matter if I work at Mickey D's
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees
On a new broad, you still one to one
Every once in again I like havin some fun
No disrespect intended but what's done is done
Women steppin out for love, men do what to come
Not a playa like Pun, but when shorties get the grabbin on me
The last thought I get is Koobie run
To them girls wishin on a star that's will stun
But I gotta tell it like it is hun, one

[Chorus 2X: Lil Brother First, Lil Wayne Second]
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go
But if you're thinkin of leaving you need to let me know
We better together then further apart, so darlin don't go breakin my heart

[Verse 2: Little Brother]
We was high school sweethearts, talkin since we was teens
Every morning, and every evening
Ten years later she eatin that mean cuisine
I'm on the field, straight gone of that creatine
In the NFL which mean Not For Long
City to city, all the groupies they hop along
Word get back to wifey, she like "Stop the song"
I'm takin the kids to my mommas, I'm out, I'm gone
Momma was like Baby now I hate to see your tears
But I've been with your daddy for 'bout 35 years
And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating
But I ain't never had to wear no black eye from beatings
As long as he doing right, by you and your kids
How you gon expect that man not to be who he is
I ain't sayin that it's right but we often pay the price
Cause a womens life is love, a mans love is life
And he gon live it to the fullest, and I ain't tryna pull you down or sound like a broken record
But you should know by now that all niggaz is dogs
Better to have a rich pit then a broke german shepard

[Chorus: 2X]
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go
But if you're thinkin of leaving you need to let me know
We better together then further apart, so darlin don't go breakin my heart

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I say I don't have nothin if I don't have you
Like Shadai, we got the sweetest taboo
And my game is skin deep, like your first tattoo
I gets all in ya head just like shampoo
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices
I don't want a broken heart because I lose the pieces
Hey, girl don't play with my gangsta
And have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger
And I know cheaters never get crowned
So I play "fair" like roller coasters and clowns
You gotta hold ya soldier down
Even when the war is lookin it is right around the corner
And you don't want to leave me, believe me
Cause I could turn you on like a personal TV
It's young weezy, I know what ya thought
But I'm just here to play my part, so don't go breakin my heart

[Chorus 2X: Lil Wayne First, Lil Brother Second]
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go
But if you're thinkin of leaving you need to let me know
We better together then further apart, so darlin don't go breakin my heart</pre>
