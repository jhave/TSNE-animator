[Chris Brown]
All day, girl, I had you on my mind
And I'm thinking about maybe later
Me and you can spend some time

And you can spend my money
Me and you can feel alive
And let's forget about the world
Cause baby, this is you and I

[Chorus]
Let's get crazy, alright
Come on, let's go
Crazy, alright
Come on, let's go
Crazy, alright
Come on, let's go
Crazy, alright
Come on, let's go
Let's go, Let's go
Let's..

Dancing on the dance floor
Girl, is you I adore
Step off stage, I scream for more
My nated junk I love gold
Snap my fingers, make you mine
If not, I snap a second time
After that I guarantee you will be standing next to me
My baby, baby, baby
You're sexy, drive me crazy
I feel like I've been blazing
Buffing purple hazing
Well girl, this love is natural
Forever unintouchable
So, what you're waiting for, what you're waiting for
What you're waiting for?

Let's go
What you're waiting for
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?
Let's go
What you're waiting for
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?
Let's go
What you're waiting for
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?
What you're waiting for
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?

Let's get crazy, alright
Come on, let's go
Crazy, alright
Come on, let's go
Crazy, alright
Come on, let's go
Crazy, alright
Come on, let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's..

Love you like my boom-box
Make me wanna moon walk
No, this ain't no old love
Lamborghini coom touch
Mrs Maseratti, hop inside my Bugatti
Girl, I'm a make you mine
Hot damn you're fine, I want your body
I want, I want, I want you
Love me, damn, why don't you?
Girl, this ain't no puppy love
Grown man shit, no youngster
I would love to touch you
I ain't trying to rush you
But what you're waiting for, what you're waiting for
What you're waiting for?

Let's go
What you're waiting for
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?
Let's go
What you're waiting for
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?
Let's go
What you're waiting for
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?
What you're waiting for
What you're waiting for, what you're waiting for?

Let's get crazy
Let's get crazy
Let's get crazy
Let's get crazy

Let's go
Let's go
Let's go

All day, girl, I had you on my mind
And now I'm thinking about maybe later
Me and you can spend some time
And you can help me spend my money
Me and you could feel alive
And let's forget about the world
Cause baby, it's just you and I</pre>
