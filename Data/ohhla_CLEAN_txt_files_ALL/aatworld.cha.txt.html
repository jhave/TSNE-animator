(This goes out to girls all around the world)

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire - rapping]
Black watch, black shirt, starin through my locs (locs)
Lookin at you lookin like you know I'm goin to approach (approach)
We could do a uh, well we could do a toast
While you sit across the table tryin to figure out my gross (gross)
You out your mind, if you ain't mind makin (mind makin)
'Cause I ain't got the time for time takin (time takin)
Money doesn't grow on trees but I'm thinkin (but I'm thinkin)
You ain't never seen the millions I'm rakin (millions I'm rakin)
In, get a garbage bag
I be talkin trash, let me throw away my swag (let me throw away my swag)
I be talkin math baby, they be talkin half (half)
I be talkin yacht language, they be talkin raft (raft)
Where you want to fly?? Give you wings like Red Bull (Red Bull)
We'll be flyin on the jet skies like Jet Blue
You freaky I could probably give your knees a schedule
You freaky I could probably give your weave it's next pull (woo!)
And I got plenty of sky miles (sky miles)
The four is goin to come after the G, when I'm out (when I'm out)
And she already knowin what I'm 'bout (I'm 'bout)
The paper boy, it's only G's on my route
If you want to (want to), then we can do whatever ('ever)
Whatever is clever or whatever is never (never)
Whatever is green, baby whatever is yellow
That's whatever is G's (cheese), whatever is chedder
I promise the card ain't got a maximum (maximum)
Stacks with 'em, so he goin to have the straps with 'em (straps with 'em)
They be like you look exactly like it's him (it's him)
Car dashin/Kardashian, it looks exactly like a Kim (like a Kim)
I'm in a zone, she ask "can she hold me?" (hold me)
I won't let her, I'm just tryin to score like Kobe (score like Kobe)
And you just tryin to block like goalie (block like goalie)
But I'm a give her D like my first name Moby (first name Moby)

[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
(All around the world, girls all around the world), haha, get 'em
(This goes out to girls all around the world), yeah
(All around the world, girls all around the world), get 'em
(This goes out to girls all around the world), all around the world
(All around the world, all, all around the world), get her
(This goes out to girls all around the world), know what I'm talkin 'bout?? Yeah
(All around the world, all, all around the world)
I know they be tryin to talk about my singing, but (get her)
(This goes out to girls all around the world), let me do it, let's go

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire - singing]
I used to not know why haters would try so hard to hate (why they hatin baby?)
Until I moved up from Ramen Noodles to shrimp and steak
Ewww (I know you like that steak)
Girl (filet mignon)
You can order what you like (haha, it's on me)
You can order what you like (haha, it's on me baby)
'Cause we'll be on a yacht, starin at white beaches and waves (that's what I'm talkin about)
And you'll be tannin topless tellin me you're feelin great
Ewww (you're feelin great baby) 
Girl, I'm a help you clear your mind
I'm a help you clear your mind (Chamillitary mayne)

[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire - rapping]
Uh, yeah
She said "Hakeem, we should pause for a quick flick"
Seen my jewels, I remind her of Slick Rick
Dough that'll grow like we heatin up biscuits
Chamill got a mil that's as cheesy as it gets (I don't get it)
Cheddar, Velveeta with the money
I don't break a sweat baby, even if it's sunny
Ladies they love me, I'm Fresh like Doug E.
I hated being broke so I made money my buddy (haha)
I promise I don't say it just to spit it (spit it)
Go to Saint Martin and tell 'em I already did it (did it)
French or the Dutch side, tell me if you with it (with it)
Cook like the Curry goin be finished in a minute
Steak's so large, she goin to say she want to split it (split it)
Passport fool, you would think I run the city (city)
Put me on the stand, I'm like "ah, damn (ah, damn)
I promise there's a witness that saw me gettin in that - pool
Yeah, the Thrilla in Manila (woo)
Thrilla in Manila, naw I'm trilla than Manila
We could catch a flight, maybe we can get a dinner
While I'm bumpin that "Trilla", while I feel ya in the villa (villa)
Business man, do whatever stop no ma'am
BlackBerry's near, always lookin for mo' grands
Ronald Isley is the sound of the slow jam
If sex is a weapon, then I'm ready to go BLAM! (hah)
Get a two day tan
'Cause the other two days, me and you stay in
Turn backwards like Kriss and them used to do they pants
Your homegirl just mad, 'cause her dude ain't Cham
The kid goin to prevail when it come to the skills
Like LL "I be doin it and doin it well"
But right now when I do it, I don't do it for sales (oh yeah?)
When I do what I be doin, I just do it for self (haha)

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs
All around the world, girls all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world
All around the world, girls all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world
All around the world, all, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world
All around the world, all, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world

[Outro - Chamillionaire - talking over the Chorus]
Yeah, we in Dubai on a peninsula baby
Not an island, a peninsula
An island is completely surrounded by water
and a peninsula is almost all the way surrounded by water
Haha, we do it big like that
Hugh Hefner's next door too
What up Hef?</pre>
