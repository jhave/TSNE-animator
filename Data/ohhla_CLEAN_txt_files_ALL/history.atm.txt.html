[NWA airline attendant]
Welcome aboard ladies and gentlemen
This is Northwest Airlines flight 7-7-7-7 (echo)

[Old vinyl sample]
Real love
It's the real love
It's the real love

[Slug]
What is history when it's being made?
C'mon help me make it, you come here help me make it
What is history when it's being made?
Girl help me make it, come here help me make it
What is history when it's being made?
Brother come here help me make it
What is history when it's being made?
Everybody, let's make it
Since 1972-72-72 (echo)

Please take a moment to locate the exit nearest to you
Using(?) in line, cause they may be behind you
With our cabin unpressurized at a high altitude(?) during flight
We should be arriving safely (?) in dropdown compartment above your seat
Neatly pull the mask firmly toward you
Start to suck oxygen (?) with the mask over your nose and mouth
turn you on your locking strap over your head
over your head - over your head (echo)</pre>
