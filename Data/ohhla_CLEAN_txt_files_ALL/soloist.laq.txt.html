[ VERSE 1: Laquan ]
Soloist, yo, I'm a pro at this
Lay back and relax, that's how I go at this
You gotta be dope, no joke, you must go for the kill
Cause only the strong survive in this field
What I'm a new jack? Well, you can call me that
I'm not new to the skill but I'm new to the wax
Lett's on the mix, does tricks with his hands
Stretch the flex, then I expand like a rubberband
Chumps that drip will get stomped you bet
Get out of line, step up, I fly your head like a jet
I gotta protect myself and what I rightfully own
It's mine, you try to steal you get thrown
You're in my zone, the lone zone, so make a U turn
You're messin with the flame you're gonna get burned
Call me Laquan the superior vocalist
Identified as a soul soloist

(My only weapon is the)
Soul

[ VERSE 2: Laquan ]
Listen up, the concept is rippin up
The mic I'm grippin up, I refuse to let up
So shut up, you're like provokin me to nut up
DJ's sweat when Let begins to cut up
My tolerance is limited, so watch your mouth when you speak
Step up, you get swept up off your feet
Petrfied when I ride, the mic is amplified
So you can hear me with clearity
I peel caps in my rap, I pack a mic like a pistol
My weapon's my pencil, a poet's utensil
And when it's empty I fall back and reload
Let it build up and let it explode
Dwell inside my pattern, brother, you're stranded
Handcuff the bandits, they're like scandalous
Get into this, deep into this, step to this
And like the wind I'ma breeze through this
Jam and ride with it as it slams
Cool Laquan, yeah, that's who I am

(My only weapon is the)
Soul

[ VERSE 3: Laquan ]
We're still in movement, so don't stop stoppin
The pace is kept in a swing perspective
A mellow swing is how I like to go when I flow
Because I'm comfortable with the tempo
Often I'm asked what's the reason for this
Because you're teethin for this and it's the season for this
Questions, questions, I'm hounded with questions
So I throw the answers at your direction
Draggin the suckers for not movin enough
You think I'm puffin a bluff, well keep pressin your luck
Real with this is how I deal with this
Straight as a drill with this, I show skill in this
Stay on the look-out, fall asleep, I take your head out
If that doesn't work I step back and let lead out
Now I'ma show that I can do what a crew can do
As a soul soloist

(My only weapon is the)
