[Lil Debbie]
Hey bitch, what's up?
You know what, I'd really like to do that
But I don't have any fucking money
Like I don't have any fucking money

[Kreayshawn]
Ey bitch, do you really really really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib, steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like
La la la la la la la la la la la la
We have to
La la la la la la la la la la

Hey bitch, I see you workin at the mall
At Forever 21 selling tanks and shawls
You wanna quit your job
You need a place to go
Girl run your own show, but don't be on some hoe shit
Bounce with something cute on
I kiss into a fog zone
I be really off
In searching for some water doeeee
What it do, let it go
And go hard
Lemme see you do it, go hard, like real hard

Ey bitch, do you really really really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib, steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la
We on the
La la la la la la la la la la
We on the
La la la la la la la la la la
Do it like, do it like, do it like
Let me see you go hard, go hard, go hard

Girl you need that new
Bottles on chill, I got gold chain flu
Little lady on my side
Show me how you ride out
Be a good one and I'll take you to my hideout
Pretty little bitch, dripping like some water though
I be on that strong and coming for that low, low
What I did, let her go
She's back now
She went real hard til she threw her back out

Ey bitch, do you really really really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib, steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
We on the
La la la la la la la la la la
We on the
La la la la la la la la la la

Silly girl, take your jacket off
Get off the floor
Go hard, go hard
Go hard, go hard
Do it like, do it like, do it like
Let me see you go hard, go hard, go hard
Go hard

Ey bitch, do you really really really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib, steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
We on the
La la la la la la la la la la
We on the
La la la la la la la la la la

Do it like, do it like, do it like
Do it like, do it like, do it like
Let me see you go hard, go hard, go hard
Go hard, go hard, go hard
Do it, do it, do it
Do it like, do it like
Let me see you go hard, go hard, hard, hard
Go hard
Go hard
Go hard</pre>
