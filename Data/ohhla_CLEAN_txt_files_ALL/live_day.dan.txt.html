Song:   Live Every Day
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Bitches in the kitchen, roaches in the cereal box
Front open but the screen don't lock
We just live everyday, we don't go no prob
Piss in the alleyway we ain't got no pot
The hook want us all, law harassing us daily
Pyrex pot still feed our babies
Crackhead moms sell dick for fixes
Forced to sell rocks, do two a rendition
Now a hundred, ninety-nine die in a million
Still hiding work in my grandma's ceiling
Old school stash in a crown royal bag
Thinking of the future cause the past is the past
Pain in my heart cause my daughter miss her dad
Wanna get my life straight, give her what I never had
Pain in my heart cause my daughter miss her dad
Wanna get my life straight, give her what I never had</pre>
