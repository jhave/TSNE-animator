Chorus: Three 6 Mafia

There's some cowards in this thang, if you see em point em out (4X)
There's some cowards in the South, If you see em point em out (4X)
  
[Juicy J] 
Act like you know me, when I tell that I'm from the North
Act like you know me, when I ask ya let me hit the shorts
Act like you know me, if I holla and front ya boy a ki
Act like you know me, when I'm on the track in evergreen
Act like you know me, when you see the platinum on my wrist
Act like you know me, when you know that I done took yo bitch
Act like you know me, if you know that I been husslin'
Act like you know me, rock for rock the record business man
Act like you know me, if I pull the strap and bring the pain
Act like you know me, if you see me on them twanky thangs
Act like you know me, when that fire shit is all we smoke
Act like you know me, if I tell ya nigga hit this dope
Act like you know me, when I'm winnin in this dice game
Act like you know me, if I tell yo' hoe dont touch the grain
Act like you know me, if I tell you niggas bring it on
Act like you know me, point'n in yo face a fuckin tone
 
Chorus
  
[DJ Paul] 
Act like you know me, cause I'm armed with guns and ready to bum
Act like you know me, cause I bring the war like Vietnam
Act like you know me, when you see me cruising were you lay
Act like you know me, cause with bitches I dont fucking play
Act like you know me, cause I'm super serious with this evil
Act like you know me, in my Regal - chrome desert eagle
Act like you know me, I hate say it but when I'm on some blow
Act like you know, I turn gorilla might rape a hoe
Act like you know me, I'm from straight fucking Black Hav.
Act like you know, that I bet that I blow that I aint afraid
Act like you know me, 'fore you say that on yo CD's
Act like you know, once before I caught you in the streets
Act like you know me, cause these bullets know no fucking name
Act like you know, I brought you in and take you out this game
Act like you heard of Triple Six is bout some bigger bussiness
Act like you heard if it's a murder, you can be the witness
  
[Lord Infamous]
Act like you know me, when you got pounds of the green dough
Act like you know me, when you want to hit the ski slopes
Act like you know me, when you got gallons of alcohol
Act like you know me, when you braking down the bowling balls
Act like know me, when you got a load of freak hoes
Act like you know me, when you got the pearl to touch her toes
Act like you know me, when I tell you that my name is Lord
Act like you know me, when I tell you Lord will cut your cords
  
[Crunchy Black] 
Act like you know me, cause you know I like to wear black
Act like you know me, cause you know I like to tote a gat
Act like you know me, cause you know I pop up on ya set
Act like you know me, cause you know I came to get it wet
Act like you know me, cause you know you got to call the cops
Act like you know me, cause you know the fucking blocks hot
Act like you know me, cause you know I took yo fucking spot
Act like you know me, act like you know me nigga, NOT
  
[Gangsta Boo]
Act like you know me, got you niggas saying I'm the shit
Act like you know me, when you see me with my fuckin clique
Act like you know me, when I creep and sneek up in yo house
Act like you know me, when you hear, I done cleaned the house
