Now, don't get me wrong the 10 Commandments is cool,
See once upon a time I too believed in the Golden Rule
Unemployment figures at an all time high
(?) nation dwindled, so the (sauté?) swindle
Got tossed the fuck out the window
You know what I'm saying?
Kottonmouth kings still blowin smoke rings
Keep your head up

It's a high society

It's time for some realization,
Not fueled by media manipulations
But the manifestation of the last generation, legalization
Fuck your pensions if you're paid, pay attention
Teachers of this land, yo your all on detention
You failed to mention about this everyday struggle,
Placed me in a bubble but it popped on the double,
Now your in trouble cuz I'm older now I'm bolder now,
Bitch, I'm a soldier now
Been raised to blaze in the simple place,
Like a greyhound's race to brace this of disgrace
I've seen people starved till there no life left,
I've seen heads kicked in for the words that they said
Police crackin skulls with no questions asked,
A suicidal shot from a shotgun blast
It didn't have nothing to do with (?)
It didn't have shit to do with the ones that they dropped
It didn't have nothing to do with the land that got stole
believe me motherfucker, I see right through your mind control

I won't drown, drown, drown in your society
High times, it's a high society
Lies, lies everyone keeps tryin me
Why wont they just let me be? It's a high society

First of all lets get this straight, this systems full of shit,
They say 'In God we trust', your a fuckin hypocrite
Crooked politicians lying out their ass
Money hungry whores behind the doors smokin grass
No trust in the nation, trust in the nation
Spending all the money on the fucking immigration
Walls caving in it's getting hard to breathe
51-50's what this system's done to me!

Money don't mean shit to me, it grows on evil trees
It breaks up families, it's more like a disease
Cuz it's tension, did I mention it's the governments invention,
Dollar dollar bill ya'll
Currency a money dollar for 20 bucks,
You can make somebody's daughter suck a (hooker-holla?)
Turn a boy into a baller, watch his chips stack taller,
Dollar dollar bill ya'll
You'll see all or nothin in this game of survival
Gots hustlers holdin on to the scams,
They can (watch?) their bible
But I'm viable for me to stay tribal,
And keep making these flows undeniable
But I'm viable for me to stay tribal,
And keep making these flows undeniable

I won't drown, drown, drown in your society
High times, it's a high society
Lies, lies everyone keeps tryin me
Why wont they just let me be? It's a high society

Now a nation that's stolen, can never be golden
Compassion's not true in, in this (shallow amount?) of ruin
Modern industry, the industrial complex
A system of no balance, and not enough checks
Disease bred, transmitted through sex
Revelation (to for wishin'?)
Can you pay the tuition? Can you make the grade ?
Is life really all about getting paid?
Money can't buy nothing buried in a grave
Slave driven, unforgiven
The more you make, the better your livin'
So it's all role-playin, playing roles, grave diggers diggin' holes
Genetics strange, passed down through years of pain
So the cure you seek for the mentally weak is just the norm
As we weather the storm, so it's conform or suffer</pre>
