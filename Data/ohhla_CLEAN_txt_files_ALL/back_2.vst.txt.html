(Intro)
Uh-huh
We make regular music

(Hook)
What goes up must come down
Sorta like balloons when you let go of 'em (Let go!)
Jealous ones wanna knock my style (Style!)
Put a hole in ya head and let out the helium

[Vast Aire]
I came up with cats that ain't give two shit
We grew up in the projects with elevator piss
Dad ain't there, moms is cranky
That's why she comes home yells and spanks me
This shit ain't cotton candy
And if it is the taste is shady
Be all You Can Be - but this ain't the Army
You will get tossed it will not be gravy
New York, New York, I'm in Uptown baby
Now I rest in Brooklyn, the city is crazy
Buildings fall down, that's friction homie
Elevate the camp wit a bunch of Shinobi
I'm not lying (I'm not lying)
I can form a sword like Red &amp; Green Lion
Knowledge is grand like a G in my hand
I'ma hustler but I don't cook coke in the pan
You know!

[Break]
I'm not a rapper I just talk a lot
I'm not a rapper I just talk a lot

(Hook)

[Vast Aire]
And that wouldn't be cool if you called my name
Cuz you'll be soft like video games
Same shit different day, new toilet
You got a card on the table, I might pull it
Texas Hold 'Em, watch me fold 'em
Off the wall but my skin ain't turn white
You just entered the chamber of a thousand falls
Shit, we gon' be here all night
Peace to Metro, he gave me the insight
Me blessing the mic that's my birthright
Style's so ill it'll turn rocks to sand
Come a little closer and I'll show you unseen hand
Son, we on our own Pig Latin
We be on some infe kimpe
Now everybody sounds like Jay
And everybody loves moving the purple and ye'
You know!

[Break]
I'm not a rapper I just talk a lot
I'm not a rapper I just talk a lot</pre>
