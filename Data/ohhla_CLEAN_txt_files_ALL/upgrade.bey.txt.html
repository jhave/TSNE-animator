Hehehe, yeah B
Talk yo' shit heheh (partner let me upgrade you)
How you gon' upgrade me
What's higher than number one
You know I used to beat that block
Now I be's the block (partner let me upgrade you)

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I hear you be the block
But I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a
Leash though
I'm known to walk alone
But I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing
Believe me
Come harder this wont be easy
Don't doubt yourself trust me you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or an ego
But what you think they all mad at me for

[Bridge]
You need a real woman in your life
That's a good look
Taking care, home is still fly
That's a good look
I'ma help you build up your account
Thats a good look
Better yet a hood look
Ladies that's a good look
When you're in them big meetings for the mills
Thats a good look
It take me just to compliment the deal
Thats a good look
Anything you cop I'll split the bill
Thats a good look
Better yet a hood look
Believe me
Ladies that's a good look

[Chorus]
Partner Let me upgrade you
Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you
I can (up), can I (up)
Lemme upgrade you
Partner let me upgrade you
Partner let me upgrade you
Flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things &amp;
Upgrade you
I can (up)
Can I (up), let me
Upgrade you
(partner let me upgrade you)

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I can do for you what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equal
Still play my part and let you take the lead role
Believe me
I'll follow this could be easy
I'll be the help whenever you need me
I see you hustle wit my hustle I
Can keep you
Focused on yo focus I can feed you

[Bridge]
You need a real woman in your life
That's a good look
Taking care
Home is still fly
Thats a good look
Ima help you build up your account
Thats a good look
Better yet a hood look
Ladies that's a good look

When you're in the big meetings for the mills
That's a good look
It take me just to compliment the deal
That's a good look
Anything you cop I'll split the bill
That's a good look
Better yet a hood look
Ladies that's a good look

[Chorus]
Partner let me upgrade you
Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck tie to purple labels
(Have you rocking purple labels!)

[Jay-Z]
(Uh HOV, Uh, HOV, uh huh huh!)
I B the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lauraine Schwartz sorta dude
It's big balling baby when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads and rooms at the Bloomberg
And rumors you on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger is like a tumor
You can't put ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me they watching
We just yachting off the island hopping off
Amalfi coast
Mafioso, oh baby you ever seen Saturn
No, not the car but everywhere we are
You sure to see stars.
This is high level not eye level
My bezzle courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow now look how much I saved you
Mama let me upgrade you

[Hook]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
You my project celebrity
I keep your name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star
Unless your flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me
Partner let me upgrade you
Audemars Piguet you
You switch your neckties to purple labels
Upgrade you
I can up
Can I up
Lemme upgrade you
Partner let me upgrade you
Partner let me upgrade you
Flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things
And upgrade you
I can up
Can I up?
Lemme upgrade you
Partner lemme upgrade you

[Outro]
Audemars Piguet watch
Dimples in ya necktie
Hermes briefcase
Cartier top clips
Silk lined blazers
Diamond creamed facials
VVS cuff links
6 star pent suites

Partna let me upgrade ya grade ya
Partna partna let me upgrade ya grade ya
Let me let me let me upgrade ya grade ya
Partna partna partna let me upgrade ya (huh...)</pre>
