[Da Brat]
It's Tim and Bob again
Chante Moore again
All up in that, oww goodnes
What'chu talking about?
It's so hot
We can't be stop
Come on

[Chante]
Baby before you go
Hanging out tonight
Something you already know
Don't let them get you caught up

Every thing that you do
Could come back on you
I'm not saying that you're playing
I'm not saying you're gaming me
But all your boys don't have a lady
Looking for someone just like me
Be careful
(Be careful, be careful)

1 - When you're out there having fun
    Just remember I'm number one
    Take care of
    Take care of me
    Gotta do what you do
    But if you gamble you could lose
    Take care of
    Take care of me

Just before you go
Know I'm open, wide open
(I'm open)
You outta act like you know
Even when I'm not around
(You know)

Every thing that you do
Could come back on you
I'm not saying that you're playing
I'm not saying you're gaming me
But all your boys don't have a lady
Looking for someone just like me
Be careful
(Better watch it, watch it, watch it)

Repeat 1 (2x)

[Da Brat]
Just realize any time you choose to hang
How I throw that thing and you scream for Chante
Splish, splash, gush, push
Take care of this platinum bush
I was born, Chante Harris
Warning Tim and Bob that I rockin' with Chante Moore
So take care of me
When it rain or even on sunny days
When you hit the club with your boys looking for ladies
None of them niggas ain't got a woman like you
That can take care of home and the bills too
Cook up a hot meal and make you feel good
Get you hot with it, not trip about you stickin' it
Just keep the conversation limited, with them hoes
It could get serious when it come to
My money, my music, or my nigga
Better take care of me

Repeat 1 till end</pre>
