Well, let's do this, come on

Uh
Yea
Real Smooth,  you know what I'm sayin
Like that there
Baby, baby
Really, though

Hey, come on and warm it up
Since all them playin' hatin' niggaz wanna swarm my nuts
You got the rumor wrong, so let's fix it
Cause, it's still dangerous ??? so, don't get it twisted
Just another level, they keep clockin' some G's
And, ain't another crook you know that keep 'em droppin' like fleas
On the real-a, nigga from the gold to the platium
And, all you jealous motherfuckers wish that you had one
So, dream on, gotta work your shit, and bring your team on
But, don't you disrespect me with this infra red beam on
Cause, it's ready to get loose, I ain't playin'
Cause, rappin' is just a hobby, if you know what I'm sayin'
I gots to come with the real
Let's these niggaz know the deal
Cause, my skills pay the bills
And, my thrills get fullfilled
With fat checks
Fuck respect, I ain't trippin'
A nigga can't live off props while you're bullshittin'

[Hook]
No time fa bullshit
Just trippin' on the money
Don't be two-faced
Stop playa hatin' on me
No time fa bullshit
Just trippin on the money
Don't get it twisted
Cause, I'm the one and only

A-N-T, just trying to get his fuckin' foot in the doe (door)
While these niggaz bullshittin', puttin' dick in my hoe
I'm in the motherfuckin' studio, I'm puttin' in work
While my motherfuckin' baby mama's doin' the dirt
I got a rap to show my skills, my kids needs meals
While you bullshit, my motherfuckin raps pays the bills
Look at those rims on my Benz, I just bought a boat and bought a house
That's what you said the next time you opened your fuckin' mouth
Sippin' on some motherfuckin' Don Perigon
Money talk, bullshit, or walk a motherfuckin' marathon
And, all these niggaz straight be ph balance
Smilin' in my face, behind my back, they livin' scaredless
But, I'ma pimp, and don't keep it a secret
Cause, when I check it, I talk about the shit on the wreckit
Never comin' fake with this shit I be spittin'
Stayin' true to the game, while you motherfuckers bullshittin'

[Hook]
No time fa bullshit
Just trippin' on the money
Don't be two-faced
Stop playa hatin' on me
No time fa bullshit
Just trippin' on the money
Don't get it twisted
Cause, I'm the one and only

The pimps and the playas ride ??? to shit
So, when you representin' game, nigga, then, it's a hit
Naw, but some niggaz luck up
Like, hoes, they be stuck up
Be larger than life, off some shit that sound fucked up
What is this industry comin' to?
Promotin' all that garbage, while the real shits in front of you
Ready to break off a couple of mil
While you ??? thinkin' that it's to much trouble to bill
The new name on the charts, that's game from the start
You be sayin' that it's weak, when it came from the heart
But, now it's time fa a new twist, holdin' up my two fists
Tightnin' up all my loose fits
Cause, playa haters tryna hold me back
When all my niggaz kept tellin' me, and I told ya that
But, I ain't trippin', peep the game I be spittin
Keep the money on my mind all the time, while you're bullshittin'

[Hook]
No time fa bullshit (No time fa bullshit, baby)
Just trippin' on the money
Don't be two-faced
Stop playa hatin' (Don't be two-faced, no) on me
No time fa bullshit (Naw, naw)
Just trippin' on the money (Just trippin')
Don't get it twisted (Just trippin')
Cause, I'm the one and only

No time fa bullshit (No time, no time)
Just trippin' on the money (Come on, baby)
Don't be two-faced (Don't, don't be two-faced, no)
Stop playa hatin' on me
No time fa bullshit (No time)
Just trippin' on the money (You're just trippin')
Don't get it twisted
Cause, I'm (Don't get it twisted, no) the one and only</pre>
