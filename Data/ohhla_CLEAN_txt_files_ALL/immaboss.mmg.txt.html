[Meek Millz]
Look I be ridin' threw my old hood
But I'm in my new whip
Same old attitude, but I'm on that new shit
They say they gon' rob me, see me neva do shit
Cause they know that's the reason that's gone end up on a news clip
Audemar on my wrist... BUSTDOWN!
We poppin' bottles like I scored the winnin' touchdown
Memba meek dead broke?
Look at me up now
I run my city from south philly back to uptown

Thank God all these bottles I popped
All this paper I been gettin'
All these models I popped
I done sold 100, 000 before my album got drop'd
And I'm only 23, I'm the shit now look at me, look at me
I'm a boss like my nigga Rozay
Shawty ask'd me for a check, I told that bitch like "no way! "
Cause I made it from the bottom, it was neva no way
And I neva had a job, you know I had to sell YAAAAY!

Bitch I'm a BOSS!
I call the shots
I'm with the murder team
Call the cops
We in the building
Ya'll are not
You short on the paper, you gone ball or not?

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm a BOSS!
[x2]
I plan the shots
I call the cost

We in the bitch'
It's goin' downnnnnn
Yeaa I'm the king
Now where my mu'fuckin' crown?

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm a BOSS!
[x6]
I plan the shots
I call the cost

[Ricky Rozay]
Got so many shades, they thought I had a lazy eye
Shorty rode me smooth as my mercedes ride
No love, cry when only babies die
And when I go that casket, better cost a hundred thou
I pray to God I look my killer in his eyes
Snatch his soul up out his shirt, let's take him for that ride
O.g. is one who standin' on his own feet
A boss is one who guarantee we gone eat
Fuck a blog dawg cause one day we gone meet
I'm a spazz on yo' ass like I'm on E!
Or a double stack, better nigga, double that
Jerry jones money nigga, you a runnin' back
Hershall walker, bo jack, ricky waters
Better run that dope back
BOSS!
And I put that on my maybach
Fo' hundred thou, bitch you wish you saved that..

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm a BOSS!
[x2]
I play the shots
I call the cost

We in the bitch'
It's goin' downnnnnn
Yeaa I'm the king
Now where my mu'fuckin' crown?

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm a BOSS!
[x6]
I plan the shots
I call the cost

[Meek Mill]
Couple cars I don't neva drive
Bikes I don't neva ride
Crib I ain't neva been
Pool I don't neva swim
Fool you ain't better than, I move like the president
Err'thang black on black, you know I be strappin' that
Ratt'n ass niggas walkin' round wearin' wires
Fuckin' up the game, got the hood on fire
Bitch I'm a king, call me sire
If you say I "don't run my city"
You a mu'fuckin' liar..

I'm a BOSS!
You a fraud
You cross the line, I get you murdered for a cost
Out in Vegas, I twist them laws
At the fight we watchin' Floyd, we on the floor
YEAH! Scared money don't make no money
If I eva go broke
I'm a take yo' money
I ain't neva dropped a dime
You ain't take nun from me
In the hood err'day
Bitch I'm good, what I say?..
Bitch I'm a BOSS!

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm a BOSS!
[x2]
I plan the shots
I call the cost

We in the bitch'
It's goin' down
Yeaa I'm the king
Now where my mu'fuckin' crown?

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm a BOSS!
[x6]
I plan the shots
I call the cost</pre>
