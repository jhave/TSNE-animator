[Verse 1]:
Dear ma, it's your little boy speakin to you grown
It's been ten years since I first left home
I'm off on my own learnin life and its lessons
No grandchildren for me, no weddings
Met a nice girl hold off the excitement
When the time comes your the first one invited
Never did thank you for the way that you raised me
Thinkin back how I used to say you were crazy
On punishment when my birthdays came
Report cards, how I'm drivin you insane
Police escorts leavin you in pain
For you little boy never felt this shamed
And I apologize, I really do
For everything said that was really untrue
I had no clue what you was really goin through
But everything I am right now because of you
Her strong work effort, procrastinates some
Got love for my fam but you still number one
Whatever you need let me know when it's done
I'm ending this letter with love, yo' son

[Chorus]:
I just want you to know, that your always close to me I feel you holdin me
In the world still moldin me, I know you proud on your face I see
You can smile mama (You can smile mama)  
I just want you to know, that your always close to me I feel you holdin me
In the world still moldin me, I know you proud on your face I see
You can smile 

[Verse 2]:
Waddup pop? A lot was said when I wrote "All for You"
And every feeling I expressed, it was true
We have no ideas what emotions really do
'cause they pinned up inside 'fore they take control of you
But, I just know I'm a better man now
Regardless of the fact how it all went down
Plus me and your relationship is on solid ground
Your boy better off simply havin you around
From man to man talks, and man to man guidance
Fatherly advice REAL man be providin
No analyzin where we are in our development 
Appreciatin times spent with the other one
Anticipatin for the day that I have a son
so I can tell him what we been through
It don't matter where I'm goin, where I'm at, or where I'm into
You much more than my kin, you
You much more than my friend who, wish me nuttin but success
and it's that I'ma hand you
Am I ending this with love? Yeah, I plan to
Pop, I think I finally understand you, f'real

[Chorus]:
I just want you to know, that your always close to me I feel you holdin me
In the world still moldin me, I know you proud on your face I see
You can smile pop (You can smile pop)  
I just want you to know, that your always close to me I feel you holdin me
In the world still moldin me, I know you proud on your face I see
You can smile </pre>
