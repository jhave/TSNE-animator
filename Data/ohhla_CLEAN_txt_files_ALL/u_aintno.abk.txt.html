Song:   U Ain't No Killa
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
See most motherfuckers is scared to kill a motherfucker
It takes three of us working on this track that ain't scared of shit
Killa give it to em motherfucker

[ABK]
You ain't no killa bitch, let me show you how it's done
Cut you with a slice across the neck and when they scream rip out the tongue
I really don't give a shit cover you up with the blood of a pig
Then drop you off in the woods at night, for the animals to hunt while you sit
You ain't no killa, we beneath the streets, that's what we do
Running with a hatchet, screaming motherfuckers, swingin right at you
This for my real killas the quiet midnight creepers
The ones you see yellin' over, give your whole damn crew the jeepers
(I ain't going near that painted up freak)

[Chorus x3]
You ain't no killa
Let us show you a killa

We going to show you, we going to show you, we going to show you how it's done
Hey J, this motherfucker thinks he a killa

[Violent J]
You ain't no killa, being grounded ain't no hard time
You dove in(?) with no shine, you cannot borrow mine
You makin stories up, you talkin helli crimes
But your ass all bitch, no panties lines
You need an arrow bucked between your eyebrows
You playin Russian roulette and loading live rhymes
You ain't a killa, couldn't kill a mosquito
Talk enough shit to fill the streets of Toledo
You ain't no killa
(You all ready, I got the bb's)

[Chorus x3]

We going to show you, we going to show you, we going to show you how it's done
Shaggy the clown show em how us real killas put it down

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
With these bare hands I can put you in a coma
That's what I told you right before I choked ya
Don't wanna say that I told you so but I told ya
You talk that shit like you hard you about as hard as a scrotum
I don't get it, why you lyin won't admit it baby
Softer than a baby hoot (?) that someone granulated
You ain't a killa you about as hard as creamy vanilla
I grab my hatchet and use you back for target practice for realla
You ain't a killa
(Stick em up, motherfucker,) smack Bitch (Ahhh) you trying to rob me (sorry)

[Chorus x3]
We going to show you, we going to show you, we going to show you how it's done
[Chorus x3]
We going to show you, we going to show you, we going to show you how it's done
[Chorus x3]
We going to show you, we going to show you, we going to show you how it's done</pre>
