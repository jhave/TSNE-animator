[Doc Brown]
My generation talk of money and ice
They want it all, but they don't wanna learn, read, study or write
It's like, see rappers flossin', I don't care what they spend
I'm goin' shoppin' for food and tryna pay rent
Needin' bucks for them utility bills
Cuz to get ya heat cost enough to give ya the chills
I'm bringin' the real deal not a fantasy
Still it has to be said that I'd rather be livin' happily
ever after instead of disaster
Half the youths don't even know which bred is their father
Boys becomin' men without the men around them
And when men are around them they're breakin' in someone's housin'
I came up out the cracks of the pavement, my life is real
Despite that I ain't the type to steal
Thinks it's very rare we write to kill
And the mic is still the only weapon that I like to feel
In my firm grip, learn this from other word smiths
Who roam the Earth before the Hell fire burnt it
Earn it, even before Tottenham turned mean
Toxteth, St Bulls, race riots in Burnley
Everybody's Crazy and somebody will get it
I stress it, even if Nas already said it
Cuz man are actin' like it ain't happenin'
But we always bring it to the surface, that's the power of this rap thing

	"In my life" --&gt; The Beatles
	   "Wickedness is all that I see around me"
	"In my life" --&gt; The Beatles

		but they dun say it's hard" -&gt;Klashnekoff

Rappers like me don't always break through
Cuz we dedicate tunes to somethin' you can relate to
I don't know no one wearin' platinum fronts
Rollin' through the hood on twenty inch rims, ain't happen once
But I know about ridin' the trains, takin' the bus
Plus I know about hidin' the pain, makin' a fuss
Packin' my shit and havin' to move
Like when my mum started crackin' the whip, I started rappin' for food
Then I learned to make cash in more ways than one
Without crime or government time payin' me none
Don't watch me, I'm relentless
If I'm rappin' Sundays, Mondays I'll fund raise for young offenders
All my life my eyes been on the grime
Like a target that people wanna sweep under the carpet
The so called rotten eggs, bad apples of the bunch
But that's why our music pack a little punch cuz

[Doc Brown]
Got educated so I bring down the system and over stand it
So if there's a twisted bigger picture I know who planned it
My peers cuss me, sayin, "jeez don't study"
Call me sell-out cause I'm tryna be somebody
Sayin', "look if you a rapper you can't chat that shit", what?
"That Martin, Malcolm, Mohammed, flat shit", shut up man
"You need to keep it real, keep it gangster like me", why?
"What's the matter Doc, too much time with wifey?"
Nah listen up, save all that talk for someone who give a fuck
I got avenues, big plans man different stuff
As for you, when all of your rappin' shit dry up
You'll be in the greasy spoon cookin' my fry up
I'll tell you somethin' straight from the heart
Don't let a man try and make you think that you should feel ashamed of bein' smart
How are we gonna be embarrassed of that
Just because I read a few books doesn't make me and aristocrat
I'm listenin' out for classical rap
Gettin' opinions on what it's like to try and be a man if you're black
I feel like every album's lackin' a track
Positive, peace, purpose, progress, what happened to that? Cuz
