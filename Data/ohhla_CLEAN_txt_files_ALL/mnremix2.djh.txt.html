[Mos Def]
Yeah
Yo, yo

[DJ Honda]
{*scratching*}
"Rock on..."

Hook 1: Mos Def
I'm leaving
On the next plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me
Like you know I'll never go
Even though you know I will

Chorus 1: Mos Def
I'm a travellin' man
Movin' through places
Space and time
Got a lot of things I
Got to do
But God willin', I'm comin'
Back to you
My baby boo

Repeat Chorus

[Mos Def]
I'm leaving

(Verse 1)
Well go 'head and leave
The call heard around the world from the wives of emcees
These cats is payin' more than half a pound, my garment bag, I snatch it down
Ain't got the state, but we could prob'ly run a back a town
Scenarios like this is tear jerkers
For the modern emcee
I.E. the blue collar worker
Cause this thing called rhymin' no different from coal minin'
We both on assignment to unearth the diamond
When you start climbin' in them, I start shinin'
You be strugglin' and strivin', and they think you prime-timin'
Maintain and keep silent, make note
An observation
This confrontation
This is the daily operation
My concentration
Stay focused on my recitation
'Bout to reach my destination with no pause or hesitation
Baby make the preparation cause this ain't no recreation
This is Pro Ball
And we lettin' you know y'all
At the show y'all
Doin' this for dough, y'all
Get the phone call
And I'm ready to blow, y'all
'Bout to go, y'all
Been a pleasure to know y'all (Y'all)
And I'm lettin' you know

Hook 2: Mos Def
I'm leaving
On a jet plane
I don't know if I'll be back again
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me
Like you know I'll never go
Even though you know I will

Chorus 2: Mos Def
I'm a travellin' man
Movin' through places
Space and time
Got a lot of things I
Got to do
But in sure long, comin'
Back to you
Baby boo

Repeat Chorus 2

[Mos Def]
I'm leaving

(Verse 2)
But God willin' I'll be back home
To drop these heavy ass bags up off my backbone
Around the world with a catalog of rap songs
My baby girl is walkin', been away for that long
But no, you haven't, well, at least that's how it seem to me
My home town is like a whole different scenery
The old timers on the stoop, leaning leisurely
The new jacks up in the bar, smokin' greenery
Easily taken for granted when you up in it
But it's sweet scented
When you been down for a minute
Move around city limits, breakin' down with the vintage
The innovative
Classical B-Boy image
Collect the winnings
Cause that's the reason that we came here
This thing is not a game here, the fortune, not the fame here
From New York to the Cakalaks
Cali in the Cadillacs
Chicago know we innovate
Infiltrate Virginia State
DC make me stimulate
Philly know we penetrate
Georgia make us generate, let's set a date to get the papes
They celebrate to my jams in foreign lands
Even your mans in Japan know who I am
Minasan
Like everybody out in Nippon
Say "Ichiban"
May God man well where you're getting from
Phenomenon
'scuse me, that's a phone call
It's a show, y'all
Tryin' to get this dough, y'all
'Bout to blow, y'all
Been a pleasure to know y'all
And I'm lettin' you know

Repeat Hook 2

Chorus 3: Mos Def
I'm a travellin' man
Movin' through places
Space and time
I got a lot of things I
Got to do
But in sure long, comin'
Back to you
Baby boo
I'm a travellin' man
Movin' through places
Space and time
Got a lot of things I
Got to do
But God willin', I'm comin'
Back to you
Back to you

[Mos Def (DJ Honda scratching "Rock on" in background)]
I'm
Leavin'
I'll be back, to you
I'm leavin'
I'll be back, to you
Over the world we go
DC, all over the world
We go
VA, all over the world
We go
The Cakalaks, all over the world
We go
London, all over the world
We go
Japan, we go over the world
We go
Paris, we go over the world
We go
Shake your money maker
Shake your money maker
Move your money maker
Move your money maker
Move your money maker
