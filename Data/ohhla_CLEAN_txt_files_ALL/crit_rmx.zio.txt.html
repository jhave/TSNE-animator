[Zion I] 
Yo check out the superb tech 
Casinh checks through dialect 
Dope as the gold around your next 
This is my manuscript to spit lyrics like I'm fat spliff 
I show the whole damn world my gift 
From pirates to speakin the pawn 
Powerful just like a pawn 
Positioned in the proper placement 
Focused like militants 
Deep in concentrational cabins 
Devise the secret plan to split atoms 
I verbalize, lust to bust, just as dangerous 
As watchin Mt. Vesuvias erupt 
Corrupt your data disk 
From the super soul powered slums 
Zion I, Planet Asia make it bump, bump 
I'm deep off in the trunk 
SWATS call it crunk 
The fifteen inch woofers make the beat go thump 
I dump clips to pros 
Orrator of goals 
The chilling is killin us with the illest type flows 

[Interlude] 
"Ah yeah, right about now 
See what we don't wanna do (uhh) 
We don't wanna do...just do shit, get up here 
That's seen and did, and you know 
Just wearin shit we wore before, things like that, ya know? 
We come out to give ya a little something different 
Alright, we gonna get into a little something like this 
Whenever y'all ready...." 

[Planet Asia] 
Yo yo 
Vocally blessed to beat you into submission 
I paddle units with pro-??? from the underside, the train 
Do not touch, I'm high voltage like the third electric 
Emergency phones needed in every tunnel for this murder method 
You're dealin with the armed forces 
We wave warmed torches 
Through the trenches of the onslaughtness 
G up, we up next, I'm an-ticipated 
Post my plan is to stand behind my ever line stated 
Delux, Aeon Fluxuate/fluctuate what I pronunciate 
Cold verses be lookin out, but ya'll people got months to wait 
*Life As It Is* baby, Zion I got me flyin high 
My mind inside music symbolic to INI 
This ain't the Sci-Fi channel 
We livin legends of the speak freak committee 
Clash The Titans through the vinyl 
When we splash the atlas with the rules of the game 
We out the old school and came to drop a jewel on your brain yo 

[Interlude 2] 
"Since we are folks who has this mad passion for observance of music" 
"I am the art" 
"Beats" "Or just rap" 
"We're going to do something 
 that's a little bit different right now already" 
"And as we put it together, you probably be able to dig what we mean" 

[Zion I] 
My brother hit me on the game 
Said that we original, man 
And we manifested here to spit slang 
I thought a minute 
And let it sink deep like the Titanic 
We wider than the Ocean of Atlantic 
This typical mythical style in the West is gettin Wild 
I'm chillin like a space upon the Nile 
Reverberatin, why is you hatin, hip hop we creatin 
Across the desert sands, we be bakin 
My melanin, the key to lock, rock spots in flocks 
Off the rugged avenue with my b-boy bop 
It's evolution, toss a pebble at the devil and smile 
I'm rebelling while propelling freestyles 

[Planet Asia] 
From the bottom to the top, I made alot of em drop 
Hip hop's the lifestyle of urban civilians and even cops 
No it don't stop, once again another classic 
Fantastic rap shit that make y'all MC's wanna practice 
How to lock shit down like Daddy As 
I blaze mics for days 
Hit the page like stage then burn sage 
Then engage, this ain't a phase or some played out gimmick 
That's word to Kemet for the fact that most of y'all cats is timid 
Vivid fuels, of the do's and don'ts don't apply 
To the non-compromising Planet As and Zion I 
Worldwide we're known, zones as the chosen few 
Verbal shots, I cypher rhymes to leave holes in you
