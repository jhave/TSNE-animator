Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hu$$le]
I got all this lucci, you should come seduce me
I ain't never tricking but I could buy that coochie
Balling that's my routine
Real niggas do things
Like double park the 600 Benz in front of Stussy
Always fuck a new bitch, always buying new things
New cars, new rims, new watch, new rack
I'm fly, drop this new thing, you can't pop if you sing
You're thirsty for that lose change
We grind, flock, and shoot things
I got all this lucci, you should come seduce me
I ain't never tricking but I could buy that coochie
Real niggas do things
Like pull up in that new Range
White beamer, 2 chainz, smoking with your boo thang

[Chorus 1: TeeFlii]
Excuse my liquor, but it's some bad bitches in here
Excuse the smoke in the air, but it's some bad bitches in here
And they on the stripper pole
Yeah work it girl, work it girl
Money on they mind
Yeah, they do it for their team
Yeah, they tryna see a million

[Verse 2: TeeFlii]
Do it like a thug do it, thug do it
Put her on the wall that's the way she like it
She like it rough, she wanna fuck
It's too many bad bitches in here and they acting up
Bottles popping, my niggas we throwing money
Models at my table but we geeked up
Get it how you live, Annie live your life
Let that body move girl don't think twice

[Chorus 2]
You know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
You gon' act a fool with it
I'm gon' act a fool with it
Girl keep grinding on my Louis, grinding on my Louis

[Chorus 1: TeeFlii]
Excuse my liquor, but it's some bad bitches in here
Excuse the smoke in the air, but it's some bad bitches in here
And they on the stripper pole
Yeah work it girl, work it girl
Money on they mind
Yeah, they do it for their team
Yeah, they tryna see a million

[Verse 3: TeeFlii]
Annie R U O'tay, U O'Tay
Tryna fuck with me your turn up better be real
You gotta do the things that a nigga like, to make a nigga spend it
You got that walk and you got that talk
Ass so big I'm putting extras on it
Drink got a nigga vision kinda blurry
Now girl it's two of you, two of you

[Chorus 2]
You know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
You gon' act a fool with it
I'm gon' act a fool with it
Girl I'm tryna see you get it, Annie is you with you with

[Chorus 1: TeeFlii]
Excuse my liquor, it's some bad bitches in here
Excuse the smoke in the air, but it's some bad bitches in here
And they on the stripper pole

Money on they mind
Yeah, they do it for their team
Yeah, they tryna see a million</pre>
