[Monteloco]
(Verse 1)
It's Monday
I wish it was a Sunday
That's my fun day, I-don't-pack-a-gun day
It's cool
We do what we do
Work hard
Gang bang and go to school
True
I'm rude in Recida
I need another shot of Tequila
I see her
Only that I know
What's up, Tom, got the chron' bronze
He said, "Loco, I got you a gift
Two tickets to the Sunset Strip"
Trip
We dipped
In the ranfla
On our way
To check out these capas
Shake that ass, take off them clothes
Break some, dash, you know how it goes
Front row
Adult entertainment
All the way nude
That's my favorite
Shake it, butt naked, on the stage
Diamond girl, dancing in her cage
Glancing my way
To the slow dance
Lap dance, last chance for romance

Chorus:
(Simon Sez in background)
[Female]     Lap, dance
[Monteloco]  All to rub at the (Strip club)
[Female]     Lap, dance
[Monteloco]  Falling in love at the (Strip club)
[Female]     Lap, dance
[Monteloco]  Spend a hundred bucks at the (Strip club)
[Female]     Lap, dance
[Monteloco]  Broke as [{*fuck*}] at the (Strip club)

(Verse 2)
How can I resists those hips, those lips
Gettin' hugs and rubs with her jugs
Up and down like a rollercoaster
Esa una hermosa, doing what she's supposed to
Closer, closer, then a french kiss
What's this, I'm carressing
Miss
Diamond, perfect timin'
I'm in heaven
Just then
I heard my zipper go {*zipper sound*}
She starts to blow 'round and 'round
Guess I'm a lucky dog like Greyhound {*Monteloco howls*}
Stay down
Right here on the couch
She said
"Put it in my mouth"
Oooh!
She looked like Mariah
With the perfect tan from the playa
You can call me a liar, liar
Pants on fire from the telephone wire
Only I know that evil men do
It depends on you
If you got game, fool
She gave me
A four for one
And in my morn'
Just for fun

Repeat Chorus

[Monteloco]
Yeah...
Give ya a shoutout...
To all them dancers out there...
Keep doing ya thang, girl...
Yeah...
