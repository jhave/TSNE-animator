(Jodeci) 
I see ya movin baby yeah 
And you're lookin good, said you're lookin fine 
Everything's gonna be alright, yeah 
Let the music take control of your body tonight 
Whoa, everything's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright 
Let the music take control of your body tonight 
Father break it down 

(Father MC) 
Well I begin the weekend with a groove 
Roll about eight deep now what's my next move 
Waitin to nightfall so I can enjoy 
System pumped by four Jeeps, runnin like a convoy 
Roll to the park, kinda crowded, what a scene 
Pullin up with Jodeci blastin out the fifteen 
So I park my ride, girls see my ??? 
Notice my grill that cause the pointin and starin 

(Chorus-Jodeci) 
Everything's gonna be alright 
Let the music take control of your body tonight 
Ooh, everything's gonna be alright 
Let the music take control of your body tonight 

(Father MC) 
Now I sign a couple autographs, take a few flicks 
Order Don Perionne and lay back with my chicks 
Michael's on the left of me, Smooth is flippin 
Took ??? away, I'm on the dance floor rippin 
?? is for the cutie, the ??? I'm tryna' find 'em 
Tim is in the front and Mobat is right behind him 
And me, I'm just layin on the prowl 
Got' say what's up as the girls cry out 
She grabbed her man, I think she tried to play him 
My only thought, was to step to the A-M 
'Cause I came to have a good time 
And at the end of the night, no doubt, I'm gonna get mine 
'Cause I don't have to raise my voice to be seen 
I maintain, if you know what I mean 
Understand I'm not conceeded, Father's just mellow 
I'm a smooth, dark Romeo, freak kinda fellow 

(Chorus) 

(Father MC) 
Do that dance, do that dance, baby 
Do that dance, let's work it out 
(Both) Do that dance, do that dance, baby 
(Both) Do that dance, let's work it out 
Do that dance, do that dance, baby 
Do that dance, let's work it out 
(Both) I said do that dance, do that dance, baby 
(Both) Do that dance, let's work it out 

(Father MC) 
Loungin on the DL, this type of night is rare 
I glanced to the right, oh who do we have here 
Puffin Sweet, gettin ripped, what the hell 
I see Mr. Uptown, it's Andre Farwell 
Conversatin with his boys 
I say stop and barge straight through the crowd, 
it's time to get charged 
It's kinda mellow so I leap, 
to the center where the soul's rollin five deep 
Mark Currey, a ??, kin and nephew 
Doin the wild thing 'cause the soul is true 
And everytime I see bodies gettin biz' 
Girls are gettin wild 'cause Father's known for his 
And everytime ya hear the music thumpity-thump 
And all the girls gettin bumped right in ya rump 
So everybody who feel the mood is right 
Get on the dance floor tonight 

(Chorus) 2x 

(Jodeci) 
Everybody dance with me, ohh yeah 
Everybody move with me, everybody 
Everybody dance with me 
Everybody move with me 
Everything's gonna be alright 
Let the music take control of your body tonight </pre>
