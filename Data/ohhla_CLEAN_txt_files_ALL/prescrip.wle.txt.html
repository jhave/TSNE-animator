Artist: Wale
Album:  Attention Deficit
Song:   Prescription
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Simply out of this world by choice
The world's too much for the soul to enjoy

I focus on the void and I fill it
Hopin' the depressed ain't give in and give up
So listeners give up your ears, it's your hero
From here on a heroin like high, I give off
Live off my lie and my lullaby
They itchin' for a new breath here's the calamine
And I refuse to camoflauge with other guys
You see my mind is amused of they head noddin'
I so got 'em, as hypnosis of hip-hop
'cause, when I talk they don't just watch
I make 'em feel it, the feelin's' unfamiliar
A rush of your adrenaline you can pick up a buildin'
You can become a killer, if properly scripted
The first one's free, next time I'll be billin' ya

Here go your prescription [x3]
Take your prescription

Don't let the pain getcha
I swear my lane will provide as a painkiller
A painkiller, a 16 of Percoset
Just let it chill Joe
That lil' burn that you feel, feel good don't it?
Just sit back and relax and take it easy
And let the beat play
Close your eyes, whoever uninspired
Pay me no mind, I put Adderol in y'all's
Riddle them with Ritalin, attention deficit
Niggas start listenin', and what I'm givin' them
The drug that they brain need
Them niggas sick of hip-hop so they appointed me
And I invened but the IV inside of me
And ignorance was drug of choice but they OD'd
Couldn't alone leave 'em
I am the sole leader
The young soul that the OG's still believe in
And if you not convinced keep on promotin' them
I breathe life in the game, they are Kevorkian
They provokin' suicide but as soon as signed
I drew designs for consumer's minds so in time
I do it for all y'all, do it for all y'all
Don't gotta wait long
The doctor has arrived just be patient
Please, please

Here go your prescription [x3]
Take your prescription

[Talking]
See, they say one has to know the past to last in the present
So I, bask in the weather while the presence
of these laggers lend me they rappin' to give gifts to my brethren
My nigga this is more than a vocal booth
this is my, only truth, this is my risin' up
So you can ask Black Thought if I know my Roots
Shit, before you? uest my Love for this
just know we would play Q-Tip in the Q before you knew T.I.P
And before you knew T.I.P. I was tippin' strippers properly to Pussy Poppin'
So, when you ask me "What you know about that?"
ironically I'm askin' you the same question partna'
I am hip-hop. Past, present and future
I can rap on some old Primo, sound like the present Sigo
and make it feel like a sequal to the new me, bitch
I'm Wale, the prescription</pre>
