[Drake]
I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit last
Don't make it too easy girl, don't take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that
Only you could do it just like that
And I love it when your hair's still wet cause you just took a shower
Runnin on the treadmill and only eatin salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard knowin you
Weekend in Miami tryin to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Mighta been a time when I loved her too/two
but you take that away and you always been the one, one
I wonder why the moon looks nice girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
Used to niggaz comin on too strong girl
They want you in they life as a wife
That's why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protest
Why you wanna fight for your right
Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run e'rything, fuck that noise

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard but girl you got it, girl you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they lookin at you everywhere you go?
Wonderin what's on yo' mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muh'fuckers wanna waste yo' time it's just amazin girl
And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you {*3X*}
Everything's addin up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you

[Nicki Minaj]
Bet-bet-bet-bet-bet I am
All of them bitches I'm badder than
Mansions in Malibu, babblin
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row your boat
It's Pink Friday Records and O.V.O.
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It's Mac, OPI, and a fragrance too
Apparel, I'm dominatin every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, lil' gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I fl-fl-fly, I'm flyin high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch!

And baby, if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
Be a million, billion, trillion miles awayyyyyyyyy
Ohhhh
He-he-he-he-he asked my sign, I said a Sag'
I'm a STAR, sheriff badge
What's the point, if I'm guarded?
Double D up hoes, Dolly Parton

[Chorus] - last line "That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are"

[Outro: Drake]
And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you... {*echoes*}
And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so...
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you {*3X*}
Everything's addin up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are</pre>
