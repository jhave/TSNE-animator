[Intro: Junior Reid] 
Don't take it there, don't take it there 
Kay Slay, don't take it there, Papoose you ready? 
This is my place, this is my place 
This is my place, my place 

[Chorus: Junior Reid] 
You don't wanna go there with me 
You don't wanna war with me  (No) 
You don't wanna go there with me 
Make sure you check up on my history 
You don't wanna war with me (No No) 
You don't wanna go there with me (No) 
Before you go there with me 
Make sure you know you fuck with real OG's 

[Verse 1: Papoose] 
There's only one boss in this town and 
He ain't dark skin or light skin, he brown skin 
He don't like none of ya'll hangin around him 
Cause ya'll the same people who ain't wanna crown him 
They said I put out two hundred songs they whylin 
Three hundred and fifty five but who's countin? 
Def Jam offered me four hundred thousand 
Slay said we 'gon get a mill for your album 
I told him I can't fly I'm not a falcon 
But god damn it, we 'gon make it over this mountain 
Do it for my shorties who go to the island 
Openin their legs up, putting an ounce in 
This is my house, I'm protectin my house then 
Standin in the window with my gun like Malcolm 
He gettin his feet wet cause I allow him 
But if he come in deep waters, I gotta drown him 
Thug-A!!!!!!!! 

[Chorus: Junior Reid] 
You don't wanna go there with me 
You don't wanna war with me  (No) 
You don't wanna go there with me 
Make sure you check up on my history 
You don't wanna war with me (No No) 
You don't wanna go there with me (No) 
Before you go there with me 
Make sure you know you fuck with real OG's 

[Verse 2: Papoose] 
Moet bottle upside yo' head {*glass shatters*}
Cristal bottle upside yo' head {*glass shatters*}
Hennessy bottle upside yo' head {*glass shatters*}
Woulda hit 'em wit the Dom, I'ma drink it instead
Why you worry 'bout how I spend my bread?
Man you ask a lotta questions, I think you a Fed
Chill, 'fore you get stoved on, you know you not a killer
Stop nigga, I stole on you like a shoplifter (No)
Under the cover, y'all ride with the ratchet
This nigga asked me what size is my jacket
I don't think you could fit this, that's kinda small
But you can fit in the graveyard, 'cause it's one-size-fit-all
'Cause I'ma lead to violence, you better believe
So the only thing I got on the arm is a sleeve
Why would I tell a man give me work on a arm
when I could stick his ass up and take the work out his palms?

[Chorus: Junior Reid] 
You don't wanna go there with me 
You don't wanna war with me  (No) 
You don't wanna go there with me 
Make sure you check up on my history 
You don't wanna war with me (No No) 
You don't wanna go there with me (No) 
Before you go there with me 
Make sure you know you fuck with real OG's

[Chorus: Junior Reid] 
You don't wanna go there with me 
You don't wanna war with me  (No) 
You don't wanna go there with me 
Make sure you check up on my history 
You don't wanna war with me (No No) 
You don't wanna go there with me (No)

Make sure you know you fuck with real OG's 

[Outro: Junior Reid]
Why the hell they think that they can mess around me?!
