[Verse 1: Lil' Fame] (Letters in caps are both Lil' Fame &amp; Billy Danze)
Look! The first nigga that scream G-Unot to me

Somebody talk to homey tell him I don't play ball
You fuckin with them Saratoga hackers off a St. Marks

The First Family is Fifth La Familia, all day y'all
So go 'head and start a beef, yo' ass'll get popped
With a hot one cause we ain't blazin hip hop and r&amp;b
I ain't a New York City ho that get pistol whipped
Then stripped for your jewels then I'm a rock 'em in the next video

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I'm up early in the morning, tryna make a move
You comin in when ya shorty take ya lil one to school
Even though she caused the drama, you love ya baby mama
I hit her wit the lama, to get this cake
Give us the coke, the cash, the combo to the safe
If she don't know it...Damn! ok we'll wait
I'll play wit yo kid on the couch while ya bitch on the phone
Wit the gun to her head sayin "Daddy come home"
You was rollin poppin bubbly, didn't think it get ugly
Had the whole shit is lovely until it go bad
Now you can pray for a miracle, and God might be hearing you
And the nine'll jam, right in my hand

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (M.O.P.)
I'll whip yo' head boy!!(BONG!!!!)
You know I will....
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)

Yo' cap could get peeled
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)
Yo' ass could get killed...
I'll whip yo' head boy!!(BONG!!!!)
You know I will....
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)
Wit the back of the steel....
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)
Yo' cap could get peeled
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)
Yo' ass could get killed...

[Verse 3: Billy Danze]
WOO!!! From the midst of the dark barkin it's Bill Gates
From the behind the bodega with two eights
I mean, with intentions of settin yo' ass straight
I mean, yo' ass leakin, bleedin reachin for faith
I mean, you barely breathin, with your soft survivin ass
What happen to your hood vibe with your good ridin ass
What happen to the gangsta that you see on TV
(It was expected!!!) That's cause it was projected in 3D (Come on!!!)
And you don't wanna see, me comin lettin that Mac spit
(BONG!!!!) Send a nigga to a semi back flip
(BONG!!!!) Saratoga Ave nigga act sick
(BONG!!!!) M.O.P. doin this rugged rap shit

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (M.O.P.)
I'll whip yo' head boy!!(BONG!!!!)
You know I will....
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)
Wit the back of the steel....
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)
Yo' cap could get peeled
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)
Yo' ass could get killed...
I'll whip yo' head boy!!(BONG!!!!)
You know I will....
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)
Wit the back of the steel....
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)
Yo' cap could get peeled
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)
Yo' ass could get killed...

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
Ooooh!
I got his homies screamin "Buck you need to calm down"
Niggaz be gettin killed everytime you come around (Yeah!)
We ran up in his crib, made his momma kiss the ground
She askin God "What my baby done did now?"
I'm taking everything, jewelry, I want it all
Duck tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall (Give me that nigga!)
Fuck waitin, we gon' start waitin on tomorrow (Huh!)
So ask satan if he got a car that I can borrow
I'm impatient like a money hungry rap star
Jack him for his chain and I can get a new jaguar (Whoa!)
The mac'll have his brains all over the fuckin sidewalk
And I'mma be on CNN again, it ain't my fault
March nigga step! (Step!)
Right nigga left! (Left!)
G-Unit soldier, I'm thuggin to my death motherfucker!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (M.O.P.)
I'll whip yo' head boy!!(BONG!!!!)
You know I will....
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)
Wit the back of the steel....
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)
Yo' cap could get peeled
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)
Yo' ass could get killed...
I'll whip yo' head boy!!(BONG!!!!)
You know I will....
I'll whip yo' head boy!! (BONG!!!!)
Wit the back of the steel....
