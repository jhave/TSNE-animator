[Devin the Dude]
I didn't come, I didn't call ya
Matter fact, I forgot it was your birthday
I didn't check, my messages
I guess I was drinking, thirsty in the worst way
I didn't realize
That you wanted me, just as much as I want you
Tried to get between them thighs
You asked me to wait, but I just didn't want to

[Chorus]
Probably should have, when I could have
Spending time, worrying when you gon' put out
Thinking with my third leg, with my foot out
Now I'm sitting round here, in the shit house

[Devin the Dude]
I forgot to, thank you
For all the thangs, you done for me
I didn't bother, to help you
With your rent, when you asked me for a G
I can't be playing a fool
That's what I thought you was all about, money
Now you with another dude
I want another chance, but you don't want shit from me
I didn't tell you, how much I needed you in my life baby
I didn't tell you, how much I care for you but I

[Chorus]

[Devin the Dude]
When you were gone, I was all alone
I met a girl she was fine, and submissive
She was cool, she wasn't you
She only fucked didn't cook, didn't do dishes
But that ain't what it's all about
Realized, she was just like them other fake bitches
Slamming do's, and throwing shit in my house
And now she's cutting up my shit, man what the fuck is this
I sometimes, think of you
As I toss and turn, at night
Now you gone, with someone else
And I lost the yearn to fight, probably shoulda treat you right

[Chorus]

(*talking*)
You know most of my time is, pretty much thinking of you
I even look at the pictures we use to take
Realizing, that I made a huge mistake
I wish I could, turn back the hands of time, I'd do a lot of things differently
Respect your body and your mind, so I can have both at the same time

I didn't tell you, how much I needed you in my life baby
I didn't tell you, how much I care for you but I

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
