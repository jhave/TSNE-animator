[RZA and Diaz conversating on a boat]

[RZA]
Yeh, this some good motherfuckin weed man, fo real
Niggaz got me out here on the Norwegian sea
Yo Diaz, I'm sayin what, we gone see a whale fo real?

[Diaz] Of course, of course
[RZA]  We gone do, let me see that motherfucker
[Diaz] When we get that motherfucker, kill 'em
[RZA]  KILL 'em
[Diaz] We gone eat that shit
[RZA]  Oh, ya'all niggaz eat whales?
[Diaz] Hell yeah

[RZA]
Nah nah, I cant, I cant kill no whales
Oh man, I heard thet were here before us man
What the fuck is that right there comin close and shit
Oh we gone se Moby Dick

[Diaz] Finn fram harpunen'a. (Find the harpoon)
[RZA]
Hey damn, hey yo, nigga, one right there
OH SHIT, OH OH, HOLD ON NIGGA HOLD ON, HOLD ON

(The beat starts)
[Diaz]
D-I-A-Z
And the R-Z-A
yo yo yo yo

I'ma turn my aim up, cause I spit overseas now
My head's supplece now, got a new rease now
I've been local, but my rep's gonna increase now
Prevent that, find ya self in a tight squeeze now
I really feel, we all need some hip-hop police now
It's all about C's now, too many MC's now
Please now listen, I'm takin somebodys place
Fuck who that be, ya'all cats can't hold it like me
Though I'm not from no famous, borough or state
I've spent years in this shit, more than eight
I'm more than great, I cross more borders than weight
I serve you 24/7, ya'all can order this shit late
And choose the language too, just go ahead
You want norwegian or the spanish row instead
Toma, para los que pueren entender (Spanish)
Til de som står og ler, vi får bent dem ner (norwegian)
(=For those who are standin there laughin, we bend them down)
Nei(=no), I can't compare, ya'all shit this hot
Ya'll can't flow like Diaz, or make peace like RZA

[Chorus][RZA]
Ta ra ratta Ta ra ra ratta
Yo, yo
We like to get, get high
Chase ????, chop
Ski, feel the breeze
Y'all cant fuck with this cat from the northeren sea

[Diaz]
Heard ya'all Mc's talk alot, let's get back to this
I dont know if ya know this, but ya facts are twist
Up and coming motherfuckers just act as if
What they need to learn about is what practice is
Ya'all should get a teacher, who you lack is Chris
It be funny to see how you react to this
I'm like that +Activist+, I run up with bombs
While screamin 'fuck rap', with C-4 in both palms
I keep spittin after I blew off both arms
RZA came through, I'm used to flow over tarms
Beef that is, I'm tryin to reach these kids
Go head to head with these labels, beat their bids
Do whatever it taes, I never shit slide
Bout to switch on they ass like Jekyll to Hyde
Nobody takes me for a ride, put it to side
That's not an option, time for me to go outside
Hard to knock loose, cool with that much pride
God's my witness, I dont got too much to hide
That wasent the truth, Virgin Mary would I cry?
Peeped it with closed gates and I've would've fried

[Chorus]

We like to get, get high
Smoke, smoke, lah, lah
Trees, and feel the breeze
Y'all cant fuck with this cat from the northeren sea

I might, get my, my big, big G-A-T
And start the squeeze, 16 shots at you crab MC'z

Nigga, we can get high, high
Chase ????, chop
Ski, feel the breeze
Y'all cant fuck with this cat from the northeren sea

I might get, get my, my big
And squeeze 16 at you ????? rappers wanna touch my team

Nigga, we smoke, smoke lah, lah
Can, can get, get high
Ski, feel the breeze
Y'all cant fuck with this cat from the northeren sea
