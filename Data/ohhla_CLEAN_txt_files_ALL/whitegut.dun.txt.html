(Big Boi)
Yeah
So fresh so clean, when I step in the booth they scream
Like All Temperature Cheer, dungeon D-boy here
In effect mode like Who's to  Love it? so slow motion
like 3 wheels and triple cheeseburgers ATL coastin (say no more!)
But the pimp is one of the coolest but I (pay no more)
Been known to rock the big blocks and colorful ga-tors
with the flip-flops, and the silk socks and a Kangol to the tip top
I flow hard you drip drop
Cleaner than the urine of a two time felons piss test
I'm sitting in some Monte Carlo curse right in the headrest

(Bridge)
White Guts
White Wall tires
Floor plush
It's so fire!

Fire meaning breathing like a dragon and it's seeming that I'm
falling into a world of my own (2X)

(Bubba Sparxxx)
My own world too
white thangs can't complain
Bubba on them white guts
custom made ain't a stain
0-2 Z-7-1 on them Mickey T's
standing with ya man wanting me to sign your hickey please
I don't need no worries keep ya white guts
how I'm riding these days keep me with the right sluts
he's just Bubba happen to love the  D.F.
you in the midst of history Betty take a deep breath
sitting on the tailgate polo to the boxers
Bubba is the truth you a homo if it shocks ya
reppin loud and proud with my buddies from Atlanta
you trying to live cleaner here's a study and example

Hook:(2X)
White guts
white wall tires
floor plush
it's so fire
brains blowed sittin on dubs
come through could never be loved

(Gipp)
Sitting on 400 wides that's what they love
Incense swingin from the mirror that's what they love
Six course licked with the glaze that's what they love
drive with the dealership tag that's what they love
hairbone strayed on my shoulder that's what they love
the smell of new leather in the cold that's what they love
strawhat V-neck t's that what they love
moonroof open blowing smoke that's what they love
Romeo cologne every week that's what they love
that's what they love
that's what they love
go from 12 to12 Monday to Sunday
take the first two days and sleep like mummies
and I'm out

(Khujo)
Who in the spot you move!
play games with us you lose!
mercy rules beat you make you say he mean as hell
but the cutest nigga out the group
gotcha head spinnin like tread on a spool
clean as a fool
with them gold shoes oooooh!
and I got that pool
make you wanna HOLLA!
Seen in my impala hear them flow-
masters duals amp tweeters and twos
stay alert on this dirt
don't be no fool
I take you to school
shoot you like pool
rep with his I don't do
expenses I dumped you! ????
Outkast, Goodie Mob Dungeon Family
I thought you knew

There's this one in my stable
Saville so motherfucking clean
It's got a soda shade around the mean green
these youngster have never seen
it has a signature wood grain steering wheel such as yours
but oh my God what are harder are the hard wood floors
it's not coincidental all the glass was kept clear
who's worried his or her first shit it's freezing it here
the only heat is my piece to make it even at least
I'll go to work without even catching a crack in my crease
I guess the dubs out there do what they 'posed to do
I'll ride 15mph to make a believers out of you
I got a lawsuit, pending charge for wreckless blade spinnin
I was riding through west end and killed two women UH-OH!

C-a-d-i-l-l-a-c you and me will grey so cleanly
C-a-d-i-l-l-a-c blowing smoke so high and freely
C-a-d-i-l-l-a-c you and me uh
blowing smoke so high and freely</pre>
