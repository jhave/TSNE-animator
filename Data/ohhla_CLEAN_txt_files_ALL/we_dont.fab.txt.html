Sick motherfuckers!
Go head, throw up nigga
Yea yea ok, I know you
I know, I know

[Verse 1]
Even when I had smaller digits
The kid was never, a playa hata or baller bigot
Every week, pay em all a visit
I bring Pamela Lee to the P's so we all can dig it
I popped enough alcohol so we all could swig it
Guns, stand them up they be as tall as midgets
O.k, I'll rap a little faster
But do I really sound like I turned from a rapper to a pastor
I'm like you except I date supermodels
The cars that I drive, the state troopers follow
We get the same parties probably
My stones look like sunshine, yours probably cloudy
And I dont front for nothin'
I likes, I gets, I want for nothin'
I'm givin' ya straight answers
And I'd rather be dead than livin wit hate cancer

[Chorus]
Say wha you wanna say, talk wha you wanna talk
WE DONT GIVE A FUCK!
Look how you wanna look, grill if you wanna grill
WE DONT GIVE A FUCK!
Act how you wanna act, front if you wanna front
WE DONT GIVE A FUCK!
Live how you wanna live, try if you wanna die
WE DONT GIVE A FUCK!

[Verse 2]
I just used to post on the corner, roast marijuana
I'd be on the coast of Tawanna
Bitches who look, close to Madonna,
Dosie cabanna, toast by a ?
I 'posed to be wanna of those dudes ridin in Testaroastas upon ya
Not the ? but I'm gonna, I keep toastin the armor
for niggaz who supposed to be drama
I mostly just wanna, get fed garlic toast and lasagna
Get head while I'll roast in a sauna
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S, how can you hate that?
And I aint concerned wit the scandals
Cause its all bullshit my attroneys can handle
Ya insides be burnin like candles
Rippin down posters, turnin' the channels
You wanna end up on the ern on the mantle nigga, yea

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I look at these brothers and laugh
Jealous niggas dont hate havin, just others that have
I still got love for the av.,
Come through to give ya niggas girls baby mothers my math
I speak on others behalf, only hate makin money
and gotta give the government half
You know this brother live last
And not even Mike seen Jordans in the colors I have
I used to run from undercovers like Shaft
That was until this young playa got shoved into the draft
Now I'm covered in ice, like Bruce Lee's body
Niggas is scared, to lose these hotties
Talk if you wanna talk, grill if you wanna grill
We dont give a fuck nigga
Front if you wanna front, try if you wanna die
If you live its luck nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
