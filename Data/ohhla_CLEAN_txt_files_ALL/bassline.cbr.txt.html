[Intro]
Leggo

[Chris Brown]
The wheels on the Bugatti go 'round-'round-'round
Tappahannock in V.A., yep, that's my town-town-town
If you wanna, we can do this, girl, right now-now-now
You're a model? I got bottles, pour it down (yikes)

[Chorus One]
Ay girl, tell me what you're taught
Pretty motherfucker, I'm a put you on the wall now
Ay, girl, you can get it all
Cause I know you like the way my beat go
Beat go beat go beat goooo
Ay girl, tell me what you're taught
Pretty as a, pretty as a picture on the wall now
Ay, girl, you can get it all
Cause I know you like the way my beat go

[Chorus Two]
(Bassline)
Girls like my (Bassline)
Girls like my (Bassline)

Gonna shake it to my (Bassline)

(B-b-b-b-bassline)

[Chris Brown]
I-I-I-I'm winning, you heard about my image
But I could give a flying motherfuck who's offended
T-t baby, if I go any harder
I'm get you out your guarda, but you're somebody's daughter
But I just wanna know you wanna get it the way that I do
And if you with it, just bring your friends, cause they're loving the crew
I like your piercings, your attitude, girl, and all your tattoos
So come get it with it, leave with me and take this key to my room

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Chris Brown]
Yeah, I'm getting money, I'm a name my price
Thousand bottles, on these models; nigga, this ain't your night
Frank mule got a nigga chillin', how the bitch feel with ice
My bassline to her waistline, a nigga 'bout to bust them pipes
I'm wildin', money piling, two dime twins when their thighs bend
In a way I can make Bruce Lee want to throw the towel in
Man, life is just so glorious, you could never worry us
You niggas just be playin' then gravy in notorious
I said them girls in the front, bet that Breezy make 'em jump
Over here we got that loud, over there they got this bump
Boy, we do this every night, you got to save up for a month
And you just say I'm blowing smoke, but nigga, I'm just being blunt

[Chorus Two]

[Outro]
Do it
Go
