[Chorus]
So I'm outside of da club and you think I'm a puuuuuuuunk
So I go to my loaded tech 9 that's off in the truuuuuuuunk

I ain't never scared (westside!)
I ain't never scared (southside!)
I ain't never scared (northside!)
I ain't never scared (southside!)
I ain't never scared (eastside!)
I ain't never scared (westside!)

[Verse 1: Bone Crusher]
Let a choppa go PLOOOOOOWWW! to yo melon
Now the plasma is oozin outta yo cerebellum
AttenCHUNNNNN! Fuck nigga, now you swellin'
You ain't talkin hardcore, now is ya? Lil' bitch!
Got'em runnin scared of a... BIGGA NIGGA!
Cuz I put the heat to his ummm... HILFIGER!
Now on dat drank and on some of dat dank
My pistols gettin' thirsty now it needs anotha drank

REPEAT CHORUS

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I got a hot 4 fever, call it bitch Benita
Knock the apple off any bum or the hollow heat seaker
Redcross bitch niggaz, fuck the pint, she take blood by the liter
I'll never leave her, my viscous vixen
On liquor, send dat ass to God quicker
No matter yo religion, you Muslim, Hebrew or Christian
She indiscriminate with punishment, she send'em missin'
My gun's my favorite bitch and
And she got permanent PMS so she stay bitchin!

REPEAT CHORUS w/ ad libs by T.I.

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Noooooo, I ain't bad, just don't kiss no ass or take shit
And I'm a grown man, find you somebody to play with
If you'on like me when you see me, betta not say shit
I'll choke yo ass out like Dre did that bitch
You betta tell these pussies they ain't fuckin wit no rookie
I'm a Bankhead nigga, I'll take yo cookiez!
So don't make it a me or you situation
I'll have yo partner down at I.C.U. visitation
Like, hope for the best, but I'on think he gon make it
Not the way he was shiverin and shakin on the pavement
I'll tell you wha, if you make it, call'em grace cuz he amazin
Find out these verses wasn't the only thang blazin and
Just when you thought that I was done I was savin the
Best for last, nigga kiss my ass
Like Della Reese, they my folkz, itz best you just let'em be
Cuz I do the shit precincts and them FED's just ain't never see nigga!

REPEAT CHORUS

[Bone Crusher yelling]
YEA NIGGA! Just break'em off muthafucka!
We the real niggaz! All you hatin' muthafuckaz, underachieverz...
Step back, hoe nigga! Listen closely...
We ain't neva scared of none of you niggaz!
