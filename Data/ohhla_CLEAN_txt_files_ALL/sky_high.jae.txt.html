Higher than we ever been
Higher than we ever been

[Verse 1]
Thinking fiending on
New York state of mind
I'm forever in it and forever on my grind
I'm good, fuck what they're doing I'm good
Wish a nigga would
Bad rap on, blowin up my phone
Now we ain't in love we just kept sleeping alone
She said she love my voice, I said I love your dome
She said you're such an asshole, I said you're shitting on
I'm am uptown nigga till the day I'm dead gone
Smoking that major strong
Call it razor ramone
Say hello to the bad guy
Shawty I be mad fly
That's that 1990 slain
You scullers call it swag ha?
I gotta rebuild my game from OGs
You be surprised where a couple grams a coke could lead
She said I smoke too much
Hoe please I still get the job done cooli high
Come chief

[Chorus]
It's a good day come through spend a band
We blowin loud baby tell a friend to tell a friend
We getting higher than we ever been
Higher than we ever been
It's a good day come through spend a band
We smoking out the pound tell a friend to tell a friend
We getting higher than we ever been
Higher than we ever been

[Verse 2]
Sunset nigga, off the jet nigga
And them clouds boy, putting it down boy
Paint your motherfucking town boy
We pitching off the mount boy
Hard shoe when we pull up
Open the doors we shining when we show up
Big money shit flossing makes the doors up
Them hoes up and them bottles up
With my alligator sway nigga
Swag so crazy I'm getting paid nigga
With my leather so soft
Fly any weather birdman is the boss
10 5 just a ride fly
25 just for one pie
A hundred thous' just to blow bitch
On my YMCA beat shit

[Chorus]
It's a good day come through spend a band
We blowin loud baby tell a friend to tell a friend
We getting higher than we ever been
Higher than we ever been
It's a good day come through spend a band
We smoking out the pound tell a friend to tell a friend
We getting higher than we ever been
Higher than we ever been

[Verse 3]
I live a great life I don't know where to begin
That's just my make up in the morning go and buy a benz
Last night was a blur think I fucked some twins
I know I had a scratch fur I'm a start a trend
I got a bitch so bad I know she a 10
But I'm a heartbreaker choose I don't recommend
And every time she with him she thinking of me
She live a driving free meat at least twice a week
I don't love you girl I love convertibles
But I can't lie your sex is incredible
I ain't living here bitch you're here be scared of me
'Cause the way you put it down it's a miracle
I pull up in the cartels unbelievable
To put some rounds on this shit it's unconceivable
Got your girlfriend asking where my top at
Canary yellow diamonds where my watch at

[Chorus]
It's a good day come through spend a band
We blowin loud baby tell a friend to tell a friend
We getting higher than we ever been
Higher than we ever been
It's a good day come through spend a band
We smoking out the pound tell a friend to tell a friend
We getting higher than we ever been
Higher than we ever been</pre>
