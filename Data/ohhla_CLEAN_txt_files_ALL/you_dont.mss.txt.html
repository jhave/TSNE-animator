[Missy]
Now see, the one thing I like about the niggas
Is that they can fess up to one of they boys
That they been sleepin wit the same chick, and laugh about it
But see, a woman, could never admit to another woman
That she been sleepin wit her man
Cuz if that ever happened to me
I would call your house and be like, yo 

Dont you gotta man
Why you fuckin wit mine
See, I been through bad times
Get yo' mind off mines
You must be lonely
Why you messin wit me
But it wont be easy
To get my baby

	[Missy &amp; Lil' Mo]

	Im so pissed, you gon make me flip
