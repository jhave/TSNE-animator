I'm DC Talk and I'd like to say
I rock the mic in a kickin' way
With the def track from Valet Beat
I know it's hard to keep from movin' your feet
So hyper fundi don't be dismayed
Check out the lyrics when the record is played
Not a borderline tune but I got a case
Of puttin' God's Word right up in your face
You see D's for Decent, and you will agree
Quite explicit yet rated G
Because I rhyme hard, and I speak facts
And there's no need to curse when I bust a rap
And C for Christian, 'cause that's what I am
Not a soft sissy, I know how to jam
Pack a party for the Father above
Intense rhymes tell of ultimate love
Talk is for the lyrics, they're full of Spirit
If you are athiestic, you'd better fear it
They're from the Word, you ain't heard
It's my decision that your vision is blurred
So come on rap fans, clap your hands
Take a stand for the Lamb, it's Time Ta Jam
And remember... keep praisin' the Lord, keep servin' the Lord</pre>
