[Man talkin]
I'm sick and tired of muthafuckaz
Keep on lookin' at me round here all strange and shit
Cause I'm on the corner
Shit they on the corner, they do what they wanna do
Shit I'ma do what the fuck I wanna do
My brother Rick man he was callin' it in 1988
Shit I'ma keep on doin' every damn thang I wanna do man
I-I-I'm, man shit I'ma serve mine round this muthafucka man
I ain't scared of no muthafucka
My name Willie, my name Willie

[Bennie Franks]
I don't give a fuck who you is nigga, fuck what you got
I don't give a fuck how you live shawty, fuck who you shot
I don't give a fuck if you had a 30-pack in yo drawz
Come around here tryin' to slang, nigga get jacked for the raw
Yeah I'm clappin' at y'all
Niggaz ain't what they claim to us
Learned the game from us 
And try to slang cain from us (Man it was only weed!)
I don't give a fuck if it was weed, heroin, or angel dust
Don't let it happen shawty (Or what man?)
We clappin' ya shawty
We ghetto Sopranos
Us niggaz pack metals in our flanel
And go against what I said, you'll be headlinin' every channel
I got niggaz I done lost here, niggaz in the Fed's
Niggaz who swung out on them dummies that'll pull they guns out
And you wanna sneak and serve round here (Man I ain't sneakin')
I put ya down (Okay) if I catch ya, yeah part of the curb round here
It's blood, sweat, and tears round here
We was all born here, we all'll clown round here

[Hook - Bennie Franks (High Beam)]
Nigga you ain't from round here (Get the fuck from around here)
Nigga you ain't born round here (Get the fuck from around here)
And you ain't finna serve round here (Get the fuck from around here)
Nigga you ain't blood round here - catch a slug round here
Now who you say you know around here (Get the fuck from around here)
He wasn't even raised round here (Get the fuck from around here)
I ain't never seen yo face round here (Get the fuck from around here)
Man we don't play around here - we shoot AK's around here

[Bennie Franks]
What yo name is, tell me what yo name is
Who gave you the okay, you told ya you could slang here
(Man my brotha Rick, remember he used to call it around here)
Who dirty Rick, man that nigga been barred from round here
We ain't honored shit round here
You ain't heard, it's anybody's cut around here
And try to serve, you can lay out on the ground here
Know what I'm sayin'
I'm from the 51st Ward nigga them K's we sprayin'
We bringin' them guns round here
We bringin' them funds round here
You better listen up shawty, it ain't no fun round here
You ain't leavin' round here
With shit stacked from down here
But doctor bills lil' boy you get clapped around here
(Man don't hate on me)

[Twista]
Nigga where the packs of dro
Well I heard you got them blows
Better not come up on my tip servin' nothin'
I'ma get to bustin' at you hoes
You gotta go with the Calico
And a baby .380 for playin' me shady
Get a bullet to the neck not payin' they gravy
I'm crazy, see death in my scummy eyes
Flip a 15 over here, muthafuck if we ?? 25's
You about to get pissed
I'm mad doggin' you like the Grinch
I ain't gon' roll with this
Catch you servin' on this tip, I'ma steal you like you stole Christmas
Leavin' no witness, got plenty tanks
You got fire green and plenty bank
Thinkin' you bout to put some work down here
Did you ask High Beam and Bennie Franks
Them niggaz must have shut you down or somethin'
Heard you was a hoe and whooped for about 34 pounds of somethin'
Buck at you, runnin' this buildin' and tryin' to get yo cash on
I'ma scoop through the tip in a 1300 with a black mask on
Tryin' to set up shop, these shorties on my block will be so glad
Come and buy one sack, I'ma strap, stick dude up for that whole ?
Don't talk no shit, we got dum-dums round here
Get put in trunks around here
Standin' on the front smokin' a blunt and get caught around here
