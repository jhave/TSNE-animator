[Ann Peebles sample]
He's my sunshine, and the love he give, yeah
Gonna set me free, yeah

['Fist of the North Star' sample]
Alright, if you're that eager to die, I'll oblige you
Anytime you're ready

[Li-Mouse]
Knickolist, Cno &amp; Mouse, we come in three
If you roll with us, you know you rolling with these
Hip hop assassins, niggas, keep asking
How we murder MC's, just by rapping
Zero Gunz clapping, don't ask what happened
By the time you get answers, we already laughing
I kill mics, the style, unnoticed
Like peace in the Mid East, your chance is hopeless
Against someone with the, style like such
I keep shit moving like you stepping on the clutch
Rapidly, scatter through your mind with time
To scramble your thoughts, shit must be a crime
Fucking faggots, heh, ya'll can keep at it
I leave your whole shit framed like Roger Rabbit
Ya'll can't see me, you a bunch of a rats
I'mma ask that frog to give you a bunch of 'smacks'

[Cno Evil]
Get smacked in slow motion, smooth silky white lotion
Leave your brain sprained and drained, wet like an ocean
What's the commotion, move, get tossed off my track
There's no room for the filthy and the wack, nope, nope
Just the elite, three man team move on the scene
Martin Luther King dreams, wear our hearts on the sleave
With our adrenaline up, 'cranked' up, like Jason Statham
Transporting track sensations, to your radio stations
Cno Evil, move with the Mouse and the Knowledge
Your rhymes is liquid, mines is hard solid
Birds wings get chopped off, fucking with the rock soft
Struggling the locks off, breaking
I'm done with lecturing, I'm entering your brain
I'm entering your dames off the stength of the name
Observation (sample: Come on!) look and observe
Wonderful words, blurs coming in thirds, you heard?

['Fist of the North Star' sample]
Death shouldn't be rushed, one should savor it like fine wine
And enjoy it's aroma, but if in consideration of your impatience
I must kill you now, so be it

[Knickolist Knowledge]
You know Knick had to come through, with the crew, crack the brew
Get on the mic and spit, what he do for me and you
The Knowledge is here, products seem to be everywhere
Like old scent in your atmosphere, move underground
With The Rodentz like Splinter's lair
On the sounds that's priceless and rare
Triple power bar charges first verses to share
Three kings with golden bars, similar to street
I for two spar to get better, now every letter
So listen as we get nice on the device
Display raw talent, spit precise
Four hundred fifty six ways to kick it like the dice
Knickolist, change visuals with verbal miracles
Animes heard for the third, speak, peep it with the words
To get ready, you heard? </pre>
