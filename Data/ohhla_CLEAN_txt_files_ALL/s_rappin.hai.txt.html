Song:   Still Rappin'
Typed by: Jamalytuh@yahoo.es

[CHORUS]
"You know when the day comes I'll still be rappin'
You know when the night comes we'll still be rappin' 
Way back in the past days people were rappin'
Way up to the last day's we'll still be rappin'"

[Abstract Rude]
Underground news updates on the hour, 
they come around the crew I see the great rhyme power
freestyle, Improv, Impromptu,
bob your head to feel the rhythm so bomb you
want to dance we let the mic change hands
like a hot potato our attraction to hip hop is fatal
we're connoisseurs on tours in a Winnebago
lick shots for my spots in Diego

[Aceyalone]
We came up learned those ways living in a time 
when raps and shows paid trifling days everybody
got to eat but we all need food for thought
caught up in a real live struggle to the grave
some are just sick cause they wanna' be saved 
by the preacher man but 
I'm ah reach you men open them up way back when
African we was still rappin and beating on skins
what the people say gotta' shed a little bit of light
my insides is a beauty that is way beyond comparison
and I just wanna share it all with you

(Chorus)

[Mikah 9]
Let your mind be free let your heart and your soul 
Just grow and let your life succeed as you wind on down the road
and let it be open your eyes so you see
open up your ears and what appears it's something true and clear
and I hear transprojection is love metaphysically here it is
I'll keep it in my soul, so I will show no fear were transmitted
I'm loud and clear as for those who see the light
behind the rhymes of Mikah 9 they know the time
And I see you and you make it through some of you don't hear me
All I can say is it's all love and that's the way it gotta be
Must we rob, rape, and murder one another for eternity?
As concerned to me
I would much rather we try to help each other
Allthe way down the road but almost every time I turn around
I hear the sound of bullet rounds fly through air
I'm well aware we're not prepared to
have conversation with celestial anatomy 
of Hereon and day by day we study in astronomy
and converse in astrology and Hereon
Live my days so let's partake so let's all take flight
We used to love light to guide your way through fright
and all of those spy satellites
It's called love, my friend
I must transcend on wish and waggle will
and this is where my story ends

(Chorus)</pre>
