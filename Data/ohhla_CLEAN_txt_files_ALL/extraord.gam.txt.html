Song:   Extraordinary
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I ain't your ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya

[Childish Gambino]
Bam-B, the one like Neo
You didn't see it comin, reverse Miss Cleo
I'm C-P30, or better yet Anakin
when it comes to lightsabers that I'm handlin
I used to be king of the whack look
Now I stay king of the MacBook
Yes MacBook, where you write your numbers down
Yeah boy, I got girls in and out of town
You got it wrong like saying OJ, IJ
Stop the rumors; Asian girls don't got sideways
I gotta fuck every shade of latte
I gotta flow like my mouth to Kanye's
These niggaz think that I'm playin I ain't sayin nothin
I'll fuck your girl on the burner, I'm so top stuffing
You can't stop nothin, I'm +The Juggernaut+
That's why your B's sweet on me like I'm butterscotch
Yeah we run a lot, boy the Track Runners here
I'm Elroy we jet sun out the atmosphere
Let me make it clear, I'm your inner fear
And I'm taking over please don't interfere

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
Ungh~! I'm the streets desire
You gettin too old man, please retire
Don't make me carry you like I'm liar liar
Bring the heat like a monster, I'm +Elmo's Fire+
I'm too busy spittin shit with a socialite
I'm too busy sittin bitch with some model types
Yes sir, my girls look like Rihanna twice
with some packed bags, yeah, they ain't goin home tonight
Get your camera phone, prove you seen me
or else you'll be with friends like "Please believe me!"
I'm +All That+, I am +Kel and Kenan+
Nigga I come hard like I'm filled with semen
These rappers bore me, gun talk with black clothes
Y'all let me know when y'all let 1998 go
Y'all niggaz scared to grow! I'm never scared to go
anywhere that's new I go outside y'all niggaz stay at home
But that's alright dude; I'm a special guy
Y'all been wantin to rap since you were ankle high
And I've been wantin to rap since like what, '05?
Do the math man, how are you one of the best alive?
Bam-B, yes me, best out there
Tryin to get universal like healthcare
So fresh, so clean, like a new pair
When you get to the top, what'cha do there?

[Chorus]</pre>
