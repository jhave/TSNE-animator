[Chance The Rapper]
Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker
Cocky khaki jacket jacker (IGH!)
Slap-happy faggot slapper (BRUH BRUH~!) Iraqi rocket launcher
Shake that Laffy Taffy, Jolly Rancher/raunchy rapper
Bang, bang, bang - skeet, skeet, skeet; she do that thing for three retweets
The album feel like '92, now take that bong 'fore he three-peat
Chance, ho, acid head, cruisin' on that LSD
Asked Joseph about my deal, he looked back said "hell yeah, let's eat!"

[Chorus: Chance The Rqpper]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bounce that back (AHHHH~!)
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam (IGH!) I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam (IGH!)
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam (IGH!) I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam (IGH!)

[Chance The Rapper]
Young, Rascal Flatts - young ass kid ass could rap (IGH!)
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat (IGH!)
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack
Fourths of weed, I'm back to pack on hands with young Cletus to pat my back
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right (IGH!) just here to rap them songs (IGH!)
Rag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds (IGH!)
Sang a song, oh you don't know? (what?) Well, I still bang with you
Hang with you, sip drank with you as long as I can sang with you like (IGH!)

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
Young, ay
Niggas please be focused - that 'Bino (uh), you know this (uh)
He rep the home of Sosas, you know I'm from that Zone 6
You know I rep that Stone shit, you know your 'hood is so clit
As God as my witness, this Will Smith spit real shit
I'mma be that - CG busy gettin', where the weed at?
Bought your girl some new kneepads, you're fuckin' with the Fifi bag
My stars, egad, she said "this my favorite song"
"Hold my purse" - now she on the floor, droppin' like it's hot
You blast this shit in Abercrombie when your work is finished
Your mom won't play it in the car cause it's got cursin' in it
Your boy like "I'm the one who showed you," he want his percentage
Cause you were like "this ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it?"
Two-step - white dude's Harlem Shake
Why you laughin'? Cause you Harlem Shake
I was never fake, I was just too good to be true
That's acid rap, we killed the track, you had your +Chance+, and 'Bino too - ooh

[Chorus] w/ Gambino ad-libs</pre>
