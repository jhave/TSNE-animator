We know the game, like we know time
We know biz, like we know crime
we know a tech, like we know a dime
We know fat, like we know whack
And how to make a dope stack
We know, we know

This years money and thug affiliation
Wu-Tang Clan, Dupri colabiration.
AT ya'll?, New York, real live creation.
No busters, niggah what no imitations.
If one things not for cash and gold rings
it's real shit you can feel shit, no basin'.
Hot bitches are rich, plenty ass chasin'
This be that bomb shit, stop player hatin

We know the game, like we know time
We know biz, like we know crime
We know a trick, like we know a dime
We know fat, like we know whack
And how to make a dope stack
We know, we know

We know bad, like we know good
We know the wold, like we know the hood
We know young, like we know old
We know platnum, like we know gold
And how to get the fat dough
We know, we know

We know how to blow this weed, how to toke it up, take a smoke with us
Ya'll wanna get a hold of me, if you let me of, we know how to pressno
Get fucked up, cant you tell by the way I talk
It's the bitch in me that dwells from my head to my socks
(queen when I crock?), pop any niggah like, red (buck?)
I like sexiest crop more than ever, no mather how you wait, n' I seen us pray.
And when I slay niggah's, I butaly burn'em
I turn them into church goers, then they'll die by serving?
Pray for all ya, run for cover, When a disaster is behind us
on the lose like mine and passing others?
Dust, cuz we dont give a fuck about him.
Were's the blunts, we can't live without'em.
We know how to get the money and hussle, we know
how to split a niggah dawg, for fucking over they're dough.
We know, not to let a motherfuckah get to close
Cuz in this world we know, there aint shit free so why work niggah?

We know the game, like we know time
We know biz, like we know crime
We know a trick, like we know a dime
We know fat, like we know whack
And how to make a dope stack
We know, we know

We know bad, like we know good
We know the wold, like we know the hood
We know young, like we know old
We know platnum, like we know gold
And how to get the fat dough
We know, we know

We know this trouble, like we know hoes
We know the style, like we know clothes
We count bank, can we get dough.
What? Money and fast cars
we cant let it go, Dupri and cappadonna kid
We got the flow, shot callers
ya better be low, so what's on player?
Your money with the Wu, it's all about paper.
What the fuck you wanna do, champagne all night.

We know the Streets, like we know heat
We know what's right, like we love ice
We know what's ill, like we're getting bills
What? know what's love, like it's love is love
Push, come the shove.

What's ya'll gonna go with this shit?
Yeah, play it, it's the Wu.
Four of us buyers, money on the lable
No fucking around, Gats on the table
Getting money for life, That's how you say it's stable

We know the game, like we know time
We know biz, like we know crime
We know a trick, like we know a dime
We know fat, like we know whack
And how the make a dope stack
We know, we know

We know bad, like we know good
We know the wold, like we know the hood
We know young, like we know old
We know platnum, like we know gold
And how to get the fat dough
We know, we know</pre>
