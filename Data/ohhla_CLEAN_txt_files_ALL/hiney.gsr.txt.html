Nah you know what we gotta do?  We gotta do - HINEY!
The bitch said, "Panch stand behind me
And put that monster in my hiney," HI-NEY!
My dick about killin, never been about game
When there wasn't pussy, there was always my haind
Nine and a half-'ll get you in a dame
Anything less is just a GOD DAMN SHAME!
Check my balls, my shit got blue wrinkles on the face
.. for them bitches who had the nerve to put me out they place
In they HINEY
The bitch said, "Panch stand behind me
And put that monster in my hiney," HI-NEY!
I come through your block, with that one-eye whistle
One hand on the whistle
One.. one-eyed monster hit you
Make it slick, BITCH, my dick game's OFFICIAL!
Lose your weight and, I don't leave you waitin
The world is earthquakin
My balls got yo' ass shakin - it's hiney jack!
UH-OH!  HINEY!
The bitch said, "Panch stand behind me
And put that monster in my hiney," HI-NEY!

{*imitating the beat*} When I bust a nut, it say
{*imitating the beat*} On her HINEY!

{*laughter and applause*}

(That's some brilliant shiznit, yo!  Aiyyo!)</pre>
