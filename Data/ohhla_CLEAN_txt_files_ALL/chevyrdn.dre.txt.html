[Intro]
This is, This is, This is, This is...
Chevy Ridin' High... (Ross)
Chevy Ridin' High...
Chevy, Chevy Ridin' High

Today...

[Hook]
Chevy Ridin' High boy, Chevy Ridin' High boy
Chevy Ridin' High... Bumpin' gangsta music
Chevy, Chevy Ridin' High boy, Chevy Ridin High boy
Chevy Ridin' High... Bumpin' gangsta music

[Rick Ross]
I'm a real thug so my rims scrub
No black and milds the blunt filled up
I got a V-12 sweeter than the female
It feels like intercourse bucklin' the seatbelt
Picture all black down to the shoes man
Brought it from a Don gave his ass two thangs
Know him as the boss I swerve two lanes
Picturing Ricky Ross me and Dre do thangs

[Dre]
Listen up nigga I got an idea
I aim this K at you and you come off the pies nigga
I ain't playing fool this ain't X-box
But I can take you to the morgue and you pick out the best box
The rover ridin'(Dre), the chevy speakin'(Dre)
Yo' hoe she vibin'(Dre), She gonna let Dre hit it
I'm from North Miami ain't no secret homey
Quit acting hoe and walking like that chick Naomi

[Hook X2]
Chevy Ridin' High boy, Chevy Ridin' High boy
Chevy Ridin' High... Bumpin' gangsta music
Chevy, Chevy Ridin' High boy, Chevy Ridin' High boy
Chevy Ridin' High... Bumpin' gangsta music

[Dre]
Me and Ross back at it ya'll ass backwards
My homey Dirtbag (yesss) he got don status
Epedemic is an army Triple C is a navy
We combine and take over this state shiiit
My partner D. Wade keep a heat jersey on em'
I just tot heat from haters that try to hurt me homey
I got monopoly chesse I work the streets hard
Try to dodge the snitches with get out of jail free cards

[Rick Ross]
I sold food like ruby and gene's
I'm telling' ya my whole crew rock rubbies and g's
Put me in power when he threw me them thangs
I came back money bags and louie in seams
Crystial rosey yeah I poe that
We connected with Cali we back door that
You see my wrist man keep your pink wrist bands
She can't believe I'm in a chevy even though I'm rich man

[Hook x4]
Chevy Ridin' High boy, Chevy Ridin' High boy
Chevy Ridin' High... Bumpin' gangsta music
Chevy, Chevy Ridin' High boy, Chevy Ridin' High boy
Chevy Ridin' High... Bumpin' gangsta music</pre>
