Yeah, kill 'em, how we do it dun
Get your gunz nigga, we killing 'em
Getting real up in here y'all
What like, is like, is like, is like
How we do it dun
Murder muzik
Big Noyd, Big P
Get your gunz nigga

[Noyd]
Yo, you know who we be
The R-A double P, E-R
Niggaz fuck with this
And they get sent to the E-R
I see y'all flashing, diamond, dancing, shining
Keep your head up
Cause you'll get wet up
Flashing diamonds, dancing, shining
But thugs like me, repping QBC
Is a place when is cold out, niggaz go all out
Make the dogs bark, you know nigga the gunz spark
Drama we into, and bring it to you physical
With four-fives, four nines
Gunz aint a thang duke
You know what them thangs do
Swing and lay whole crew
There's tension in the air
Better chill when I'm telling you
I know you down from eighty-five live
You ain't scared to die
You getting dough and getting by
Yatti-Yatti-ya
But its real when the H-N-I-C
And the R-A double P
Strap with them G-U-N-Z

[Chorus]
My gunz popping, your gunz pop
We could go out shot for shot
We can do it to the gunz go lock
Bust none stop, y'all niggaz want a gun play
My gunz popping, your gunz pop
We could go out shot for shot
We can do it to the gunz go lock
Bust none stop, oh niggaz want a gun play

[Prodigy]
Really, lets do it here and now
We dont negotiate
We dont settle out, we pull a heavy metal out
We make niggaz shit, make niggaz piss
Niggaz humble when my duns rumble
Go ahead pop your gun
We got those too, this ain't nothin' new
You aint a threat
Whatcha a gangsta, you a vet
Whatcha you a thug who demand respect
Like I give a shit
Nigga I'll give a clip to your abs
You get torn up fucking with P
You'll get it bad
Its like the same old song
Let nigga front, blow his top off
And I'm not in the wrong
Cause nigga deserve every piece of death they get
Every piece of bullet, every chunk of flesh they lose
You knew the rules, you knew what you was getting into
You touch me, so its mandatory that I hit you

[Chorus]
My gunz popping, your gunz pop
We could go out shot for shot
We can do it to the gunz go lock
Bust none stop, y'all niggaz want a gun play
My gunz popping, your gunz pop
We could go out shot for shot
We can do it to the gunz go lock
Bust none stop, these niggaz want a gun play

[Noyd]
Yo, yo, yo
We aint shooting doors
We kicking doors down
Bucking your broads
Dont let me catch you, eye you up
And then draws, we murder y'all
Criminal minds, pack nines when they rock
Foul way y'all sound
Thats how we get down till they rot
If your gunz pop nigga, my gun pop
Do the maths, somebody ass gonn be up in a box
Its not me, no days, no nights
And you, no more rocking your wear
Guccis with your Nikes

[Prodigy]
True, no more fronting like you larger than life
Nigga I'll terminate your days, cancel your nights
It's not a problem, holla at my dawgs
Show you how to work them guns
Fuck a spare clip, we got extra drums
That'll handicap your team
Till y'all bleed all over the street
Whiles I, get the fuck up and outta here quick
And if ur man wanna ride, for your bum ass
The shit nigga

[Chorus]
My gunz popping, your gunz pop
We could go out shot for shot
We can do it to the gunz go lock
Bust none stop, y'all niggaz want a gun play
My gunz popping, your gunz pop
We could go out shot for shot
We can do it to the gunz go lock
Bust none stop, these niggaz want a gun play

My gunz popping, your gunz pop
We could go out shot for shot
We can do it to the gunz go lock
Bust none stop, y'all niggaz want a gun play
My gunz popping, your gunz pop
We could go out shot for shot
We can do it to the gunz go lock
Bust none stop, these niggaz dont want no gun play

Nah, faggot ass nigga
Clap 'em down, clap 'em down, clap'em down son</pre>
