[Verse 1]
You can't help of the way that flow
When he leave the club ladies be like, "did you see which way did he go?"
That will wraps a coop out from a radio though
When my single drop I'ma charge 80 a show
If you droppin' with me you ready for a pitfall
When my shit hit stores I'm charge a ?
Man, I'm tryin' to cop my toys in too
And stay away from the boys in blue
Just 'cause I'm gettin' dough the beast are made at me
But these cops are jokes like "Police Academy"
Too much stress and I ain't blew up yet
When the 7 tring to the lax got you upset
I never stress over a chick I'm slick like blue balls
If I was Papa' Smurf you couldn't give me blue balls
Big dick playa, rip through balls
Balls so large they couldn't fit into jars

[Hook]
It's my club 'cause I say club
(Club, club, club, club)
Yo, this my club song this my club song
If you wanna blow then you gotta make a club song
It's my club song, did he say club
(Duh, club, club, club)
Yo, this my club song this my club song
Everybody got one so I had to make a club song

[Verse 2]
Throw your hands high, reach for the sky for my piece of the pie
I'm a beast I ain't speakin' no lie
I'm freakily hot, freak a bunch of freaks in back of the Jeep
Hope on reachin' to speak
I put 'em to sleep, ain't no reason to speak
Way I creep got 'em say; "Gotta leave in a week"
Poof, be gone - I won't miss you at all
Not ain't sayin' I did you wrong; I ain't ditch you at all
Got a passion-o for gassin' hos
Live my life like everyday is a fashion show
I ain't playin', you know what I'm sayin'?
I wasn't talkin' about your IQ when I told you to give me some brain
Fam, you better play your part
'Cause your girl, she about to have a change of heart
When I come through find me in the cut like a stitch
Chick get wild up 'cause (I'M RICH JAMES BIATCH)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm playin' PlayStation brogan
In the back of a gray station wagon, (?) jean saggin'
Can't used to the club, what am I thinkin'?
Only tunnel I've been to is a Harley and a Lincoln
Problem when I'm drinkin'; I get tipsy easy
Leave the bartender a hundred-dollar tip; leave me
Shorty on the dance floor I'm down to get side of it
Since she sale of it I say, "Cool, I don't be buy of it"

[Hook]

[Hook II: 2X]
I'm in here pimpin' fam
Why else would I walk up limpin' man
And me beein' the pimp I am
Shorty order what you like 'cause it's on me
