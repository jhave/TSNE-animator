[Hook: Inspectah Deck - repeat 2X]
To anyone whoever lost one
Survival it may cost one

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, what up kid it's been a few years
So many blood, sweat and tears shed
Ya name still appears in my head
It seems like yesterday we floated to Queens
Holdin' cream, only 16, 'bout to load up the triple beam
Paper chasin', gettin' thrown in the pens over and over again
Comin' home sittin' low in ya bed
If ya stairin' down on me right now show me the path
So I know that havin' my people can close the gaps
Me, daily I spar as I tour this world bizarre
I've been hit pretty hard, suprised I made it this far
Seen your daughter yesterday, she's such a beaurtiful girl
Besides today, ain't nothin' really new in my world
So I wish you was here, we had a vision and the picture was clear
We'd both get rich off this and disappear
Your life is over but your legacy's just begun
And that is said, only the good die young
I guess it's all good

[Chorus: Mojehan (Inspectah Deck)]
Cradle to the Grave (from the Cradle to the Grave)
Don't throw your life away
Such a price to pay
I still feel the pain
I remember when
Things were so different then
But I'll remain ya friend
'Til we meet again

[Inspectah Deck]
Is Heaven any different from Hell? Is it worth the battle?
In search of Heaven I can get trapped too
Sometimes I wanna join you, take my place upstairs
But I'm not ready to leave my family in despair
I know if you was here you'd be rockin' the latest Nike Airs
All the fires gear burnin' one, totin' hardwear
Or we hit Lennox, check precise set of Lexus
Check the message on the pager; "it's two bucks the next chicks"
I had to do this, for Earnie Sayon and Aaron Lewis
And all my families that have been through this
And I know my days are numbered too because of you
Aiyo you got it locked, hold me a spot for when I come through
'Til then I gotta be strong, a time bomb
One step from doin' life, my rap sees miles long
But like simply when I keep holdin' on
But I can only hold on for so long

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
It's a Cold World kid, you ain't really missed much
It's hard just to get up, it's hard not to give up
I struggled tryna move up, I might lose touch
Been fightin' all my life for my right to do such
To all my single mothers strugglin'
Life bitters to the thugs out hustlin', here me
To all who walked the long road and met the end of the route
I miss you all so I send this out

[Hook]
