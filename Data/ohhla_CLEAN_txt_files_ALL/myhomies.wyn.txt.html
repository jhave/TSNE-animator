"PUMP THAT BASS!"

[Lil Wayne]
Man fuck y'all with a sick dick, semi-automatic no click click
We don't feel you, like an elephant, gettin fucked with a tick dick
Little nigga with a thick bitch, and before I fuck this bitch
I gotta put that patch over my third eye - Slick Rick
Trukfit, t-shirt, talk second, skeet first
Boy yo' girl a jumpoff, I hope she land feet first
She give me brain - research, and I prefer, reefer
But if you want some coke..
That's cool, cause my homies still...

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
("Pump that bass!") 
Yeah, my homies still - ("Pump that bass!") 
Ha, my homies still -  ("Pump that bass!")
Yeah my homies still -  ("Pump that bass!") 
("PUMP THAT BASS!") Don't make my goons 
go stupid, go stupid, go stupid, yeah 
Don't make my goons 
go stupid, go stupid (go dumb), go stupid, yeah

[Big Sean]
Boy.. Okay!
My girls and cars both skirt off (Swerve)
I like the pussy so wet that I can surf off (Go)
In a hot spot cause a nigga never chillin (chillin!)
I do it for my niggaz, I just do it to these bitches
Boy I overgrind (whoa), overshine (whoa), ain't another nigga over Sean (nope)
I'm gettin paid, it's Oprah time, I'm rollin pine, I'm so divine
I'm Westside, Westside, dark glasses on like I'm goi' blind
Lookin like Eazy-E, it's just me and Lil Weezy-We
Get off my dick!

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Look, I'm Eastside, them haters 90 goin West
My niggaz pumpin so much bass, motherfuckers goin deaf
Weezy F., I'm Eastside them haters 90 goin West
My niggaz pumpjn so much bass - ("PUMP THAT BASS!")
Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, I don't love them hoes
Got so much coke, you gon' need another nose, man
And I just play my hand, but I am not the dealer
You see I got them teardrops, I cry yo' ass a river
I got that Trukfit, t-shirt, listenin to Rebirth
I skate until my feet hurt, Hot Boy, FREE TURK
Pussy for dessert, put yo' hands beneath Earth
And I don't sell drugs, but if you need work
My homies still...

[Chorus 1/2]

[Big Sean]
Whoa, okay! 
Boy, this here's what I do-do
Got yo' sister dancin, not the kind that's in a tutu (No)
Got me in control, no strings attached, that's that voodoo (Go)
She said, "Cin't nobody do it better," I tell her,, "True-true! Yep, it's true-true!"
My, my, my bro-bro say these bitches ain't shiiiiit~!
I got the girl you came with and the girl she came wit
She leakin and drippin, whoa there, I might just come slip in
And now yo' misses went and gone missin and she addicted to what my dick did
Boy, I get it!... LIL' BITCH!

[Chorus 2: Lil Wayne] (Big Sean)
("Pump that bass!") (Finally Famous in this)
Yeah, my homies still - ("Pump that bass!") 
Ha, my homies still -  ("Pump that bass!")
Yeah my homies still -  ("Pump that bass!") 
(Lil' nigga, make my goons go...) 
Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid (Boy) 
Don't make my goons 
go stupid, go stupid, go stupid, yeah
(Boy, go dumb!)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Look, I'm Eastside, them haters 90 goin West
My niggaz pumpin so much bass, motherfuckers goin deaf
Weezy F., I'm Eastside, my nigga Sean from the West
And niggaz pumpjn so much bass - ("PUMP THAT BASS!")
Yeah... ("Pump that bass!") 
Uh-huh...  ("Pump that bass!")

("Pump that bass!") ("PUMP THAT BASS!")</pre>
