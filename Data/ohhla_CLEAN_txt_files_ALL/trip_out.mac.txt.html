Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Louis Frames hide my bloodshot eyes
My disguise from this world outside
Get the description
Paint some pictures for the wise
Got me on my serve exhibitions
Slowing down

I hit them from the...
Listen every line
Put the black light on close to blinds
Walk on the clouds
Turning water into wine
As I travel through your mind
Now you see me through your guts
Crip outside the lines so you live within the box
You're gone...
So gone Michael Jordan starts missing shots
Acid... down the hall... water from a cactus
Sniff that on and on from my head... shit
Got the Earth spinning off it's axes
Feeling like the shit no diaper
sippin apple cider
Going back and forth like a windshield wiper

Its gonna be another all nighter
'Cause I'm trippin' out
I'm trippin' out

Got a bottle of water
Couple of tablets in the half of zip
Pack your bags
We're going on an acid trip
Don't mean to scare you
Just get inside the car
And the driver say where to?

To the top please hear it from the news
And paparazzi and wake you up like coffee
Now I'm lyin' in my strawberries fields
Appeal to my senses and it seems so real
just a figment of imagination and I hear your prior allegations
And it's true, bitch I'm higher than you
Maybe go schizo open up the window
Could be like the music of Nintendo
So good bro', roll some endo
I'm trippin' out</pre>
