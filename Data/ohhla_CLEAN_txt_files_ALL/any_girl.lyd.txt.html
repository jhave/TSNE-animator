[Intro: Lloyd Banks] (Lloyd)
Uh! Turn me up! (Whattup Lloyd!)
Huh? Ha Ha! YEAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
(Long time in the makin huh?)
I, I got em like! Like!

[Verse One: Lloyd Banks] (Lloyd)
Uh! L. Banks baby baller of the year
Got about nine, ten dimes, and all of them is here
It dont matter cause before the night is done I disappear
Tell my new one Im leavin out of the side meet me there (OH! YEAH!)
Yeah, weed and bottles everywhere
Metal full of hollows I dont mind a petty stare
I dont need a favor baby Im a millionaire
Got a show hoppin out of the leer in Tanzania (OHHHHHHH!!!!!)
You aint gettin nothin you aint gettin money
Money make a mack more, more Henney more honeys
Hundred dollar bills fifty dollar bills keep the twenties
Dummy Im a go getter, bitter, old nigga, spitter (OH YEAH!)
Golddigger couldnt dig yourself a chip
Dig yourself a hole told em I was cold from the rip
Zero zero man need more of those in my shit
Hoes in my whip Mo till Im lit, Im rich!

[Chorus: Lloyd] (Lloyd Banks)
Ladies, they love me, they eyes are on my money
They pay me and I stunt, and I can have any girl I want (I got em like!)
Go shawty go shawty go!!! Go shawty go shawty go!!! (I-I got 'em like)
Go shawty go shawty go!!! GO! GO! GO! GO!

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks] (Lloyd)
Uh, black Beamers, blue Benz, red Bentleys' (Ohh)
Audemar's sporter y'all, all of y'all petty
Heavy metal hangin chain, danglin on me while I'm boppin (Yeeeeah, yeah)
I can, see the whole crowd watch-in while we rockin (OOOOH-WHEE!)
Copp-in, bottle-poppin, pop a cork like a sport
Hit a hater in the nose when I open my Rosé (Yeah)
LVs' and Gs' all over my clothes (Yeah)
Bank rolls everywhere Banks goes, she ain't yours (She ain't yours!)
As far as flows, mine's like an automatic
Mack 11 a dum-dum'll quiet all the static (Ooh yeah!)
I gotta habit, I'm fuckin like an addict
Area code scattered from the way I work magic
So tragic, nigga run up on me wrong
Grown-ass whippin bout 2:30 in the morn'
Cases of white brown and bottles of the Don
The chrome, chron', and girls on my arm, it's on
Yeah!

[Chorus: Lloyd] (Lloyd Banks)
Ladies, they love me, they eyes are on my money
They pay me and I stunt, and I can have any girl I want (I got em like!)
Go shawty go shawty go!!! Go shawty go shawty go!!! (I-I got 'em like)
Go shawty go shawty go!!! GO! GO! GO! GO!

[Bridge: Lloyd]
Go shawty! Let me see you go shawty
Show me all the things you do with yo body
Baby this is yo party, come and get this dough from me, shawty!

[Chorus: Lloyd] (Lloyd Banks)
Ladies, they love me, they eyes are on my money
They pay me and I stunt, and I can have any girl I want (I got em like!)
Go shawty go shawty go!!! Go shawty go shawty go!!! (I-I got 'em like)
Go shawty go shawty go!!! GO! GO! GO! GO!

[Outro: Lloyd Banks]
