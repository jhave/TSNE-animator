("G'd Up" by Tha Eastsidaz beat)

[50 Cent]
I stay gangsta'd up, niggaz ain't got shit on me
And I stay wit my gat in case I gotta pop somebody
G-Unit clique, you're blind if you can't see
That, we run the streets, nigga you better ask somebody

[Tony Yayo]
I got a rifle with a scope in the trunk of the Viper
So I shoot off the roof like the D.C. sniper
I just bought a Bezzle, and a brand new piece
And a level two vest and a brand new piece
Y'all hip hop niggaz don't want no beef
Y'all get shot and rat to the hip hop police
Nigga two guns up, I run up in ya label
Why your guns in the house like a couch potato

[50 Cent]
I stay gangsta'd up, niggaz ain't got shit on me
And I stay wit my gat in case I gotta pop somebody
G-Unit clique, you're blind if you can't see
That, we run the streets, nigga you better ask somebody

[Lloyd Banks]
These hoes want me stop, but this is the worst part
I was born with this game like birth marks
I don't trip, but I'ma get a little watch from my modelin' chick
Cause she spent a lot of time on my dick
I get a new fan every single time that I spit
Green, blue Ben' lovin' every diamond I get
Fast and fury in the Red Rove' cause my bred folds
Beef, I hit your necklace turn your jewelry into red gold

[50 Cent]
I stay gangsta'd up, niggaz ain't got shit on me
And I stay wit my gat in case I gotta pop somebody
G-Unit clique, you're blind if you can't see
That, we run the streets, nigga you better ask somebody

[50 Cent]
I'm from the bottom man niggaz know I came up hard
I got a temper man I'm looking for some shit to start
Man my tax bracket change, I'm sittin' on some change
Yo hoes man they changed they don't treat me the same
It's not my looks that's got me all up in them drawers
It's the new M3 with the Lamborghini doors
Man them D's they dun turned them dogs into dope fiends
They smell a leak in my clothes so they barkin' at me, WHOA

Yeah, that's gon have to be good enough
I lost a friend tonight
Jam Master Jay, rest in peace
I send my love to his family, 50 Cent y'all

[50 Cent]
I stay gangsta'd up, niggaz ain't got shit on me
And I stay wit my gat in case I gotta pop somebody
G-Unit clique, you're blind if you can't see
That, we run the streets, nigga you better ask somebody</pre>
