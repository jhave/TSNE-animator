[Pastor Troy]
They had me dodgin' the law, while I was serving my raw
Though I was young in the game, a lot of things I saw
I just bought that fifty pack, and just believed in me
And with barely could ease, that fifty pack fit the peas
I got mo' cheese than Kraft, but teachers laughed at me
They asked me what would I be with out my damn degree
I told them they would see me on T.v. and videos
I'm all about that money, y'all can have them hoes
And I got goals, I know that I can do all things
Cause now I make my beats, I write, I sing
And pain was my stepping stone
Help me realize shit, even my own'll do me wrong
But y'all a never stop me, 'cause see I got this game in order
Started off with a fifty pack, with dreams of a quarter
Catching that thing from the border, and leave my enemies crying
I will never be stopped, so you can stop ya' tryin'

Chorus:  Stop tryin' nigga <repeat>

[Pastor Troy]
Okay my money was mandatory, the glory of wealth
It's plenty niggas with promises, I keep them myself
I'm 15 on this grind, but my age don't matter
All they want is that butter, from whoever come faster
And I was after a monoply, ambition to rule
Be the Hitler of this game, if I keep my cool
I'm counting money every morning from the previous night
Go and spend, ten with Twin, heard he packing 'em tight
I'm sitting right, I'm right where I wanted to be
Ain't no mo' fifty packs for me, give me the whole ki
And I'm sure that you agree that I be hard to stop
In the three, yes three, years, I went from block to block
And now these haters are hot, cause I done locked the counter
Got the calibur glock, because I know that they 'round me
Found me laughing at these pussy boys, making me sick
While y'all be shooting for attention, I be shooting to hit
And who I'm with don't matter, cause I'm gone handle my own
Got them DOWN SOUTH GEORGIA BOYS in case you get wrong
It won't be long 'till doctors doing autopsy
Cause reason for death, its' gone send back to me
Cause y'all can't stop me, nigga, shit, this game in order
Started off with a fifty pack with dreams of a quarter
Catching that thing from the border, leave my enemies cryin'
I will never be stopped, so y'all can stop ya' tryin'

Chorus

[Pastor Troy]
Shit, fatalities get numerous, smother with cover
Send a dead rose to his mother labeled that hustla'
And they say that that's a small price, I disagree
If ya' stuck between a small life, unlike me
I can't see myself going out, without a battle
Put the bomb on the stadium, aviod the hassle
Flip the tassle, I'm a skull cap, I graduated
From the school of hard knocks, nigga, others ain't make it
So I make it my duty to be richer than Rudy, yeah Ramo
Cause this here pay way mo', you decide
And ain't no mo' lettin' me ride, hell nah shawty
Be starrin' down the barrel of that autie
Don't test me, arrest me, I'm out like Gotti, without a clue
Tell the judge that they besta pop me, or die too!
County blue, not my forte
I'm only comfortable when I got on that grind with what, with a a.k. And with a couple of banana clips, dip in ya lip
Better hush when I hit that hip, and disconnect it
Perfect it, from day to day, I take game and call it stayin'
And watch em' pay, I ain't the one
Many come up, until I dump 'em, but then they scatter
I leave ya' mamma asking ya' baby what's the matter
I'm after ya' ligaments, no movement
From Down South Georgia bitch, I REPRESENT!!!
Convince the jury, we done payed them off
Evidence don't matter, since they paid, you lost
I'm the boss, that cost ain't even worth conversation
Pastor Troy, the pastor of the true congregation
Blood wasting if ya' cross me, ya' lost me cuz
Was a eye for a eye, now its' SLUG FOR A SLUG!
June Bug know I lay 'em low, that 44, he got's to go
Shit, he got's to go, shit
Nigga stop tryin' nigga, stop tryin'</repeat></pre>
