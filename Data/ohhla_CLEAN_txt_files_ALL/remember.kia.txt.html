Remember me
The bitch that you used to see
The bitch you told yo lies to
The bitch you planned to be with
I, I always dreamed that one day we'd be ya see
I would be with you, yeah and you with me
But no
All ya did was told many lies to me
Fucked with them other hoes in the clubs ya be with
All ya homeboys lookin, lustin me
How could you not see what I had in me
Cuz now, look at me, I'm ballin ya see
But no you was s'posed to be on the side of me
Ya know it still amazes me
How you could be with ho
Fuck ass hoes not as bad as me
But oh respect is due to her cuz its not her fault
Ya know you the one to dog in the game will caught
But oh its all over now
Yeah its time to clout
I'm ridin Lexus, Benz, Bentleys, Hummers, Limos, and Towns

[Chorus]
[Hook in background]
Remember me, the bitch that you used to see
Yeah, now its me sittin on top of the world
Oh, I wasn't nothin nice
I couldn't cop ice, but now its diamonds and pearls
Now hoe why ya talkin bout me?
Yeah, now its me sittin on top of the world
Yeah nigga, I wasn't nothin nice
I couldn't cop ice, but now its diamonds and pearls
Remember me

[Verse Two]
Remember me standin out
When there was only little loot
Little cash in the pot
But I was shinin on y'all ass
Now I'm shinin some more
While yall was worried bout a bitch
I was writing my words
Thought it was all about a nigga
I was praisin the Lord
And thanking him for all the blessings
All the things that he taught me
Dealing with the problems and the worries in life
And the joys remember me
I done shined on you twice
Remember me
The one you thought wasn't gon be shit
But a little whore
With your man be creepin
That's what you thought
But I wasn't peep this
Now I'm a star on the TV blingin
House paid for and my car exceedin
A hundred g's or more
And the kids is eatin
Shrimps from store not wanting needin
Shit from a bitch or a whore
Believe

[Chorus]
[Hook in background]
Remember me, the bitch that you used to see
Yeah, now its me sittin on top of the world
Oh, I wasn't nothin nice
I couldn't cop ice, but now its diamonds and pearls
Now hoe why ya talkin bout me?
Yeah, now its me sittin on top of the world
Yeah nigga, I wasn't nothin nice
I couldn't cop ice, but now its diamonds and pearls

[Verse 3]
Remember me
The friend that I always was
Yeah dog we're finally livin good
Yeah dog the kids got it all
Ain't got to worry bout the rent
Or the lights or the phone
Ain't got ta worry bout a nigga
Cuz we stay with our own shit
Party in the club with the Hotboy clique
Yeah we're livin large
Got our own whips
Jags on dubs
TV's, homes, rich
Remember hollin nothin
Now we havin it all
Remember me
Mm

[Chorus]
