[Drake]
Yeahhhh, yeah, uhh
High Rollers, what's up? Drink Houston, what's up?
Onyx, what's up? You does it baby, you does it baby
Harlem Nights, what's up? Treasures, what's up?
Legends, what's up? Just love me baby, just love me baby
Yeahhhh (yeah) to all my Houston, Texas country muffins
Baby let me hit that liquor and that blunt you puffin
And after that, I'ma throw that fuckin Young Money up and
we can both watch it fall like it's bungee jumpinnnn
Man, I'm so high
Next time we won't smoke all of the ounce you buy
Ooh, I almost forgot to blow the candles out
Cause I don't really wanna fall asleep and light this house on fire
Good night, I'm still up, I told my girl to lay down
I see the bottle is full, I'm 'bout to drink it way down
What up Bun my nigga? Man you know we stay down
And I'm a honorary resident in UGK town
I'm on my way... yeah I'm on my way
I never give a fuck about what any nigga say
The music all slow and the bitches all pretty
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city in this thang

[Chorus: Drake]
What uuuuuuuuuuuup, what uuuuuuup
H-Town in this bitch
What uuuuuuuuuuuup, what uuuuuuup
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city
What uuuuuuuuuuuup, what uuuuuuup
What uuuuuuuuuuuup, what uuuuuuup

[Pimp C]
Uhhhhhh
Money by the ton (ton) bricks from crumbs (crumbs)
Millionaire from nothin (nothin) mind on hustlin (uhh)
Pussy's a commodity but dick sells better
Wearin Dickies and high shoes to a Cashmere sweater (uhh)
Paint done got wetter than it was in nine-fo' (fo')
The drank done got thicker and the dirt weed rolled (rolled)
Nine-six Impala with the stick on the flo' (flo')
Now it's Bentley fo' do's with my 'dro all on the do' (do')
Gas light wood nigga Polo, fuck Hilfiger ('figer)
Jammin Slim Thug (Thug) belly full of drugs (drugs)
Young hard nigga (nigga) underdog nigga (nigga)
Yellow lights on the ground cut through the fog pussy nigga
Yellow diamonds on my finger, playin in the car (car)
My dick wanna fuck but my pockets say stop (stop)
Not cause they empty I'm just greedy for some mo' (mo')
I need some mo' dough, I'm a P-I-M-P fo' sho'

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
What up doe, Young Drizzy
Sweet James Jones, Bun Beada

Well it's the Trill O.G., I got the neighborhood soul
Kushes kid I'm gettin blowed, ride and bang and get throwed
And the candy painted low (low) chrome grill in front of it
Belts on the back of it, my chromey shoes runnin shit
And shorty on the side of me is straight up off the King cover (cover)
Don't care what anybody say long as the king love her (love her)
Wish I could tell her that I don't but it would kill her
I just keep on grippin grain (drippin stain) bein trilla
Ain't another brother realer, blowin thousand dollar killa
with that Filipino flow that I just got in from Manila
'Bout to snow up in my city - so let me put on my chinchilla
In the 'rari doin +Donuts+ like my name was J Dilla (Dilla)
All about the skrilla so just point me to the dealer
Keep the work up in the attic and the money in the cellar (cellar)
Your girl up in the second, automatics for the fellas (fellas)
You see us in the back then all you gotta do is tell us

[Outro: Drake]
What uuuuuuuuuuuup, what uuuuuuup
H-Town in this bitch
What uuuuuuuuuuuup, what uuuuuuup
H-Town in this bitch
What uuuuuuuuuuuup, what uuuuuuup
H-Town in this bitch
What uuuuuuuuuuuup, what uuuuuuup
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city</pre>
