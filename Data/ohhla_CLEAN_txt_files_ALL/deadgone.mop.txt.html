Intro:
Firing Squad...To the Death

Hook:
When I'm dead and gone, you won't be alone
When I'm dead and gone

Verse 1:
O.G. Boom Bang (that's my nigga), that's right
I told you knuckle build with skil, love you after life
And since your death, everythings changed
The family ain't the same, shit seems strange
I started beef with you, use to eat with you
Sleep with you, creep with you, I got use to seeing you
But I ain't smashed up, I ain't mad at cha
I know some day we all all gonna be up in that pasture
But anyway, we finally got some ends
Princess Imani will be blessed with them diamonds and gems
Just like we always planned, so salute, to ya troop
Tribute from your man Billy Danz I love you

Hook:
When we get there you won't be alone, when I'm dead and gone

Verse 2:
Yo, the whole scenery is packed in, people dressed in black and
The whole place is flooded with tears, I'm surrounded by my peers
There I lay, day after day has been a struggle for the man
But when I'm put six feet under, will my son understand?
This is some, ILL shit, that we DEAL with, because
Caps get pealed QUICK, and we be dealin' with some real shit
It's like a universal cycle, I'm a disciple
You could be left not breathing even if you walking with your bible
So when m body hit that soil and sinkin'
I'm gonna be lookin' right over my son, even when I'm dead and stinkin'
A legacy is left behind, for mine
So he can stay strong, so that he can move on, when I'm dead and gone

Hook:
The way the world is going it won't be too long, when I'm dead and gone
I'm on my way home
Just give it up, just give it up, just give it up

Verse 3:
So kid, don't think you alone, when your daddy's all gone
Cause I won' be resting in peace till I see you grown
Carry on, nothing else could come above you
You best believe I love you, I wouldn't of brought you in this world of
struggle
There's only two places to go, heaven or hell, well only God alone
Will know, where I dwell, so stay tight, keep your head right
It'll be alright, you'll never be alone, when I'm dead and gone

I be amoungst the fallen members of my family tree
(Baby Boy Brimmer) and my man Spuds McKenzy
Princly Roy and Big Mal, Lameef caught a beat 
A cat with that Danzine smile
After I stopped breathing, I ain't leavin', cause I belive in
Achievin' goals, through spiritial soul (REMEMBER)
Death is just a heart beat away
And if you live by the gun, you gonna die by the gun I love you

Hook:
When I'm dead and gone, when I'm dead and gone
The way this world is going it won't be to long
I'm on my way home
Just give it up, just give it up, just give it
