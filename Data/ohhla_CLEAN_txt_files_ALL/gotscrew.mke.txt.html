Hoe-(hoes) peep when I creep up the block
Dope fiends beep me when they need some rocks
Add-(add) 20 subtract the top [REPEAT 3X]
I'm pimping hard in the parking lot
Screen-(screens) fall when I lean in the truck
Candy paint, fo' screens on buck
No game needed to pull a slut
I just open mouth and show princess cuts
I platinum mine at all times
I shine a lot cause I grind for mine
Hate-(hate) on me and far-(far) behind
Waste-(wasting) time by talking down
You can still trash and I'm in my prime
You feeling bad and I'm feeling fine
Who-(who) is Mike Jones? is here
Who-(who) is Mike Jones? is here
I get you crunk when I open my mouth
My diamonds shine every time I talk
I spit a verse here straight to the folk

M.O.B. 'til the day I go
Got a Range Rov' on 80 4's
On the microphone I shine and glow

Can-(candy) blue when with-(with) my crew
I represent, we drink and screw
I represent, we drink and screw

Co-(cocaine), I'm rocking it up
Yo' gal fine, I'm knocking her up
Yo' gal fine, I'm knocking her up
I got a plan, got in demand
Now hit the road and start stacking grands
Run-(running) the game with my master plan
Run-(running) the game with my master plan

[Mike Jones]
Purple drank I'm a grip and sip
Anything illegal you know I'll flip
I roll the slab with my pistol grip
Diamonds shine from behind my lip
Hit-(hit) the club hun-(hundred) deep
A hun-(hundred) sweets a hun-(hundred) freaks
On-(on) the mic you can't compete
Cause Mike Jones is in the streets
I'm gripping grain, switching lanes
Causing pain in the turning lane
In 7 months I'm running the game
Just ask the streets what is my name?
Grip-(gripping) grain, switch-(switching) lanes
Cause-(causing) pain in the turning lane
7-(7) months I'm running the game
Just ask the streets what is my name?

[Chorus - Mike Jones]
Purp-(purple) drank I'm a po' up, got-(got) the rap game sewed up
See-(see) my grill and like hold up, invisible set, prin-(princess) cuts
Purp-(purple) drank I'm a po' up, got-(got) the rap game sewed up
See-(see) my grill and like hold-(hold) up, invisi-(visible) set, prin-(princess) cuts

[Archie Lee]
Mista Masta Archie Lee, Cootabang, Swishahouse
Look, yeah, watch me, yeah

Fo' sheezy, breezy, look mayn please believe me
Stopping me ain't gon' be easy, the rap game needs me
Got freaks that wanna sleaze me, please me, and freak me
Niggaz wanna bleed me, shoot me up and leave me
Archie Lee flow nice, plus my ice is icy
You can call me nicey, my lifestyle is pricy
I like expensive things, cars, clothes, and pinky rings
Popping champagne with Paul Wall and Cootabang
Buy the bar out (yeah); pull them cars out (yeah)
Let me show ya how we represent the Swishahouse (yeah)
Paid in full like E.P.M.T., so whenever you come to Texas look it's all on me
We got the brown; we got the purple and green
In a 765, with them feez (wit them feez)
Sixteen, interior clean, plasma screen
Archie Lee and Swishahouse bitch we living our dream (yeah)

[Cootabang]
Okay look, it's Coota Capone
I'm mob style status, call me Coota The Chrome
Fuck in my pasta, slouch in my posture
Hot guns and butter, bread, cheese and lobster
Probably be on lock the day before my album drop
Hop out the next day, go platinum, diamond watch
Cootabang, Swishahouse I'm in my right zone
Paul Wall, Mista Masta: Archie Lee, and who? (MIKE JONES!)
T. Farris and Red, Watts and Dash
I maneuver towards rocks and cash
I'm that bastard, I'm that hazard
Ay, pay attention I'm that ball-diculous disaster
I'm that nigga that's ill with the flow
Probably ride through the manner, probably chill with ya know
I'm Swishahouse stomping, Nashville stomping
Shut the fuck up if you bitch niggaz bumping</pre>
