[Intro] [Bishop talking]
Yeah. What's up Rev? Haha. Bishop Lamont. This is for them niggas out there
The wack niggas...perp-perp-perpetratin'. Bishop drunk again. Hahaha, yeah

[Verse One] [Bishop Lamont]
Some cool shit for the Bishop's anthology
And when I'm done don't expect no apology
Stupid motherfuckers shoulda stepped when I warned 'em
I'm from the east side of Carson, California
I'm just anxious to whoop some ass
Wack rappers talkin' shit I'm smackin' you fags
Rainbow strip down the side of your whip
Lyin' rap magazines how you used to be a Crip
Oh what's the word?
You fulla shit
And you light skinned hairy tricks stay off 'Pac's dick
The nerve of niggas
There's too many to diss
Yeah, murder you niggas but all the rhymes won't fit
Backpack niggas up on 5th Street dicks
Now they back, wack rappin', claimin' 6-0 Crip (L.A.)
You got a problem
No problem I'll solve it
But my name, motherfucker don't involve it
Cause it can get ugly, turn Whoopi, here's The View
No sherm but I'm Tookie, put tips on you
Magnum .357, knock it I can group the heat
Cock the hammer, pop any too big MC
West coast, I'm runnin' it holmes
I've raised you kids
You come out my group home
You crazy kids, I got too much ammo
So start beef with me and get played like a fuckin' piano

[Scratch chorus]
"Funky piano"

[Verse Two] [Crooked I]
Do rae mi
But I don't sing motherfucker
When it come to lyrics I'm the king motherfucker
Crooked I's clockin' some cash, rockin' a mask
And if you run up
I'm glockin' ya ass
Put your ugly face under an oxygen mask
"Damn who did you like that" is what doctor's will ask
Who's the king of the coast? Nigga you not
I'm real enough to ghost write for the ghost of 2Pac
My brother caught a couple slugs when them dude's shot
We shot back and them dude's drop
We hit the emergency room, blood drippin' in his tube socks
I hit the studio (made a banger for your boom box)
Cause that's what me and Rev do best
We drop DJ's and MC's and started the new west
Another hit for you Sambo's
You gay Liberace niggas get played like a fuckin' piano

[Scratch Chorus]
"Funky piano"

[Verse Three] [Stylztik Jones]
Stylztik give you more bars than a Vegas strip
I evaded a squad car just to make this shit
Fightin' agent to the law like it's Matrix 6
And I'm amazin' by far with a sacred gift
From a ancient hood where the hatred is
Puttin' dead vagrant bodies in a vacant crib
I'm probably playin' Miles Davis
Black &amp; Mild blazin'
Leave a nigga achin' from the ankles to the cranium
It's crazy round here so I act bi-polar
Polar bear Express over tracks I ogre
Eat ocra, keep doja, teach cultures
End a nigga career if he need closure
Go dumb on beats like I'm from east Oakland
But I'm from the A-1-A, my people stay in motion
Motivated with music and I'm so emotionless
Flowin', open oceans up just like Moses did
I'm appalled, you rappers that say you hard
And I clap at you niggas just like it was applause
The Fats Domino, Stylez playin' the keys
All you fat head niggas wanna play with Steve
Rev said he's sick of MC's, I'm the antidote
The rest of y'all rappers gettin' played like a fonky piano though

[Stylztik talking]
Yeah. That's right. Rev you playin' these dudes like Herbie Hancock
On the keyboard. But you on them Techniques
Cuttin' and scratchin'. You understand. Hahaha</pre>
