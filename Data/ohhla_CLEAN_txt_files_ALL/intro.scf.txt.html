Yo 'Face, let's set it off
{*gunshot*}

[Scarface]
It was the day that hell had broke loose, demons in the sky with the {?}
Take over the heavens and burn it over
It's darker than the hearts of men, but I ain't scared cause I'm a soldier
I walk with my weapon across my shoulder
Refuse to live, yet impossible for me to say I'd rather die
Cause I'm a killer with the devil's eye (uh-huh)
I want the world to feel my heart, my heart, my set, my set
And these niggaz who contested me regret that
Poisonin my own breed to terminate yo' offerin
And may they die young and never live to cause {?}
I'm just wrapped up inside a homicidal mindstate
Destined to outrun the time it takes to catch fate
The day that shall come, that thou shalt be done
The day that I run 'til then I smile with the gun
Let off a shot and make the whole world hear it
Murder, I've written in blood, y'all fear it

[Outro]
As I walk through the valley of death I shall
Fear no man but God</pre>
