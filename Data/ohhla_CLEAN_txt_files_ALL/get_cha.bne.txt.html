If you come my way, you might hear buckshots in the air, Yeah, Yeah
But we like this thug shit, 
that's why we kick in the hood where thugstas play
If you come my way, you might hear buckshots in the air, Yeah, Yeah
But we like this thug shit, but we like this thug shit, 
but we like this thug shit, but we like this thug shit

Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on

Let's go, Now we down to ride
Everybody, swear to God that I'm down for mine
But I feel the Lord done bless me
We marchin' soldiers [soldiers]
Can't fuck with nothin' but them warriors [warriors]
What you thought, nigga?
And if they can't sit down with the buck to the bang, bloody redrum
And I make a little change. 
Gotta watch for the cops, there will be some, [damn!]
Duck that ass when I shoot, no longer and I just let loose
No longer can I just buck buck at you
Cause law got bitches bulletproof
Got shit to prove, got shit to move, 
make a move, playa hater, and we watchin' you
But don't you think I won't pull my shit, split your shit
That's how y'all fuckin' with thugsta's shit
Better quit that shit
Or we come and come, shit gon' be hummin', hum
And I know you don't want that, feel my warning..

Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
[Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha..]
Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
[Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha..]
Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
[Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha..]
Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
[Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha..]

It's so amazing [amazing]
I can thug forever and ever
You can't really blame me, baby
It's just the thugsta in me [in me]

Now, that's not all we do
Cause thugstas still, true
We like to ride around floss a little bit, 
smoke a little bit, drink a little bit. Nigga, don't you?
Now, we got to make these millions
We got to look out for these Bone thug children
Rest in peace, Baby Boi
Amen. Damn, shit everyone breakin' with this money, man [money, man]
But Jesus gave life on the cross so we could maintain [maintain]
Hear a voice keep tellin' me that it's gon' be alright
Just keep yours tight, and pray at night..

Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
[Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha..]
Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
[Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha..]
Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
[Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha..]
Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
[Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha..]

Thugstas, it's time for warfare, yeah [Can ya hear me now?]
Thugstas, and it ain't gon' change, so we better prepare [prepare]

If it comes my way, I'm a prepare to spray, any day. . .
If it comes my way, I'm a prepare to spray, let 'em lay. . .

Shots might be fired, 'cause everybody got guns
But ain't nobody runnin', Bone
Cause Bone niggas don't run
We marchin' heat. Indeed you bleed
But don't nobody fuck with Bone, Please

And you can get ya thug on, [thug on]
Said you can get ya thug on, [thug on] 
And you can get ya thug on, [thug on]
Said you can get ya thug on [thug on]

Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
[Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha..]
Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
[Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha..]
Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
[Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha..]
Getcha thug on, Getcha thug on
[Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha.. Getcha..]

[Tre]
If this comes your way, baby, prepare to spray, let 'em lay
[Wish]
If it comes my way, I'm a prepare to spray, let 'em lay
[Tre]
If this comes your way, baby, prepare to spray, let 'em lay
[Wish]
If it comes my way, I'm a prepare to spray, let 'em lay
