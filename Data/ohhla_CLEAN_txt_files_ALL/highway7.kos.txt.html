Peace!

...Hey, hey...
I was down to my very last song
Didn't even know which way to go
Couldn't believe that this was happening
I said, "God please don't put me back
I didn't even see there was blood on the tracks
I was still compromising"

[Chorus: k-os]
And then the rain came and the sun went down below
And the city arose from the water it was off the shore
And I realized what was happening; I had to pay the toll
It's true that you lose your mind when you gain control
But I was a fool to think I could play this game with you
Cause I was born to walk this higher road forever
There's no understanding all the things that people do
Cause when this higher road comes down we'll be born together
I said, when this higher road comes down we'll be born forever

[k-os]
Yeah...
I was down to my very last friend
I was on "Highway Kevin" again
Tell me why it's so hard to stay
In your place in the arms of the one
Seems I got too close to the sun
I was burning
Burning, burning, burning...

[Chorus: k-os]
And then the rain came and the sun went down below
And the city arose from the water and the water flowed
And then I realized what was happening; you have to pay the toll
It's true that you gain your soul when you lose control
Fool to think I could play this game with you
Cause I was born to walk this higher road forever
See there's no understanding all the things that people do
But when this higher road comes down we'll be born together
I said, when this higher road comes down we'll be born forever

[k-os]
Hey, hey...
At night I toss and turn, cause it seems that I haven't learned
That the more that you fight and the more that you try
That's the way that you making the storm
If I had my way, I would bring you back to stay
But you're gone
All I got is the crown that you wore
Is the crown that you wore (Repeat 8x)
Higher road!! (Repeat 3x)
Hey, hey, hey, hey...</pre>
