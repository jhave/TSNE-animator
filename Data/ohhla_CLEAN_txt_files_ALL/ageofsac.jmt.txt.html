[Vinnie Paz]
I make you bleed with knives
I was born with all-seeing eyes
I can snatch a rapper's heart before he even dies
The caveman still believe in lies
You don't want no blood or no beef like you was Vegan Reich
You like to sleep with guys
You a gay maggot
Listening to fucking B2K faggot
Go to raves faggot
Put a hole in your heart
Destroy everything that you know and you thought
Destroy everything in Babylon
You fucking fake rap, I hate rap cause you babble on
You fucking fags are gone, I'm a hate monger
That's reason why you talking to the jake longer
Put the snakes on you, let you die there
And who gave you the fucking impression that I care?
I can thrive here, but I choose to die
On a fucking steady diet of booze and lye!

[Vinnie Paz]
It's the age of the sacred terror
A communist revolutionary Che Guevara
Take your cheddar, take everything that you care for
Murder everybody that's what they was there for
And therefore you getting wet from the heat
Take the food from your plate, ain't letting you eat
Ain't letting you do nothing that I don't want you to
You a crumb and that's why I like to fuck with you
I don't care about anybody except me
Until my main man Mafia is set free
You waiting for the revolution to start
But you ain't on the frontlines taking two in the heart
Elusively smart, that's why I hide from the feds
Jason Vorheese style, 5 severed heads
5 corpses, 5 state troopers dead
Lickin shots in they face till the Ruger's red

[Vinnie Paz]
If you serve God for money, you serve the devil
Claim to been in war, never heard the metal
Yeah, never even been in combat
Never even felt the supreme love from a warm gat
I'm on another plane
You can stand in front of your fam
But I'm shootin right through your mother frame
I got knuckle game, but I don't use that
Fuck a fair one, where the 22's at?
Where the nitrous oxide and balloons at?
Where my motherfucking Uncle Howie goons at?
This for everybody holding hammers
If you coming to our shows and you go bananas
And holding banners, and supportin Mumia Jamal
Run up on you fuckin pigs with the heaters n' all
I'm decieving the law, thats what I'm here for
The reason why I'm drinkin all the fucking beer for</pre>
