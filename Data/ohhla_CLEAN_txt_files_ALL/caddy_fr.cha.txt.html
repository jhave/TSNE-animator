[Chamillionaire - Talking]
Uh-Huh, (G'-G'-G'-G'-G'Yeah G'Yeah)
Color Changin' Click cutty, (G'-G'-G'-G'-G'Yeah G'Yeah)
(G'-G'-G'-G'-G'Yeah G'Yeah)
It's that..damn..Ro' (Ay, Look)
Lew Hawk (G'-G'-G'-G'-G'Yeah G'Yeah)
Koopa baby (G'-G'-G'-G'-G'Yeah G'Yeah)
Tell em' mayne (G'-G'-G'-G'-G'Yeah G'Yeah)
Yeah (G'-G'-G'-G'-G'Yeah G'Yeah)
(G'-G'-G'-G'-G'Yeah G'Yeah)
It's..King..Koopa

-Ay, Ay
You say that you want fire, come hire the messiah
You say that their's one higher then Koopa, there's none liar
I got athletic compadre's that'll run by ya
And pitch that white thing in ya hand like a umpire
Come try a nigga like me, the flow is so complex
If you hatin'..don't come cuz after that comes plex
in the form of 2 ladies who act like they want sex
Put her tongue in ya mouth no, put the heat to your chest? yes
I call em' ho watts, take orders like robots
Then come home with all the dough you got hiding in yo socks, G'yeah
(Hold up, my mind movin' to fast for me..lemme catch up with myself, yeah yeah)
Head-bustas lurkin' while I lurk
Put a squirt in that guys shirt
Cuz they know how much I'm worth
And go bankrupt if I'm hurt
A laundromat holder to go put that iron to that guys shirt
Don't matter where you plant your foot on the earth you on my turf
Got boys in Oakcliff, that's deep in that drug zone
That'll go put that glove on, then go put that snub on
Then put it to your dome, and won't miss you when you're gone
"It's So Hard To Say Goodbye's" in there song
So don't think it's gon' be no apology
My dough alot of G's plus I know alot of G's
Better do it D'Bo style and snatch yo Impala keys
No back talkin' nigga just unload ya pockets please
Do I look like Al B.Sure to you?
Keep a gat and next time I'll be sure it's 2
I'll have ya matchin' the blue view a little more then who
That nigga Killa hit a nigga and that boy 'll be blue
Like the color blue you know I'm royal
Something for you, I'll destroy you
Heat so far in ya cheeks the lava in ya cheek 'll boil
And I hope ya tongue burn, gon' learn that no perm
Can get ya head hotter then what I got if my dough turn-up
missin', I'm wit 2 cheeks and I ain't gon' leave no firm
I get in hoes like dudes with a handle on a low turn
Yeah, if I turn rapper or run with a hyp deal
Lose the right, or move not Chamill just a (King Of The South)
G'Yeah G'Yeah
