[Chingy]
What's up y'all?
It's Chingy slot a lot in the house
We got Jackpot The Pimp in the back
We came herre today to address a certain issue
That all you young playas need to know about, for real

[Hook: Chingy]
Juice these hoes (what)
Juice these hoes (say it)
All my playas grab ya nuts
And juice these hoes (c'mon)
Juice these hoes (what)
Juice these hoes (say it)
All my playas grab ya nuts
And juice these hoes (you tell her)
Trick get back (uh)
Trick get back (you tell her)
Trick get back fo' yo ass get smacked (you tell her)
Trick get back (what)
Trick get back (you tell her)
Trick get back fo' yo head get cracked

[Verse 1: Chingy]
You can't fool me ho, wit that movie star role
Take yo ass to the sto', get a job and blow
Why should I love ya? why should I kiss ya?
Gang of cats banged ya, that's why I diss ya
I'ma paint a picture, didn't them gang hit ya?
Now you want me to play Sugar Daddy all wit ya
Crazy as a mental patient in a wheelchairr
Take that weave out, and go get some real hairr
Let's play Truth or Darre
Is it true that you gave head in a phone booth
Girl that shit aint you, but oh, you don't carre
When I'm out I see you sharre
I don't wanna fuck, I wanna get in them pockets
But first I gotta G, aint too fairr
I claim Dip, my set, your strip, your check, my grip
Trick, set out them lips, and them hips

[Bridge: Chingy]
Ho you can't get a dolla from me (Not one dolla)
A playa is yo man-to-be (That's me)
You are the weakest link, girl you I don't need (go on bout ya biz)
All my cats, won't you say it wit me, we...

[Hook: Chingy]

[Verse 2: Chingy]
Go on wit that depressiveness, young minded aggressive shit
Last in a tension click, really don't know who you messin' wit
Nah I don't see no sensual shit
Un-dis-respectful bitch, take a look at my neck-a-lace
Bother them when you get up fo' break-fast
You can let them pansies hit, 'til you reach my man still miss
Never delt wit pressure pimp, I retire don't never simp
Girls talk, dudes do it, I aint herre to impress a chick
My lesson is never sweat a chick, put em up front just like Letterman
I'm a better Cris, she better than the last freak that exit chick
She liked to be rubbed wit Panathan
Talk what you like and get her ends

[Bridge: Chingy]
Ho you can't get a dolla from me (Not one dolla)
A playa is yo man-to-be (That's me)
You are the weakest link, girl you I don't need (go on bout ya biz)
All my cats, won't you say it wit me, we...

[Hook: Chingy]

[Verse 3: Chingy]
They done did us so many times I gotta do these hoes
Quit lookin at me, y'all funny I don't carre if you these hoes
This how I view these hoes, hatas use these hoes
Use these hoes for what they worth then lose these hoes
Pimp's spelled wit 2 P's hoe, I know that you see O's
In my checkbook and my neck huh, it's usually fro's
I like ya groupie hoes, just come to me show
Gettin' rub without child support, now sue me hoe
Cuz..

[Bridge: Chingy]
Ho you can't get a dolla from me (Not one dolla)
A playa is yo man-to-be (That's me)
You are the weakest link, girl you I don't need (go on bout ya biz)
All my cats, won't you say it wit me, we...
