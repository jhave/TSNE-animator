[Obie Trice]
Every man determined his definition of realness
What's real to him
Everybody's got their own definition of gangsta man
Okay, this is my definition of gangsta

Surprise motherfuckers
You thought I never would arise motherfuckers
It's Obie Trice motherfuckers
Look in the eyes of a real guy
I ain't got time for lies
Niggaz frontin like they lyin
Nigga ya not tough
Decease the bluff
These streets is too heated up for you to front
Dre laced the beat
Heated up for you to bump
Real name no gimmicks give my niggaz what they want
Fuck the image of the blunt
That ain't rap dog
Be who you wanna be but let it be fat dog
We'll never let a nigga tell you how you should act dog
Specially when you're fuckin wit automatic gats dog
These niggaz ain't playin
I'm sayin
I'm sprayin
I do my dirty work wit my hands
I'm a man
Layin a nigga down he advance
You fuckin wit my plans
I'm lookin for the tooth

[Chorus  Nate Dogg]
Look in my eyes
Sayin there's a love I can hate
Cuz it's a thin line
Walk around wit my chest out
Like I got 9 lives
Never will get to your strap
Before I find mine
Wonder what the future is like
Look in my eyes
Look in my eyes
Real Gs anticipate
They got to have mine
All the hos shoppin me out
Say it's all about time
Niggaz never open they mouth
Cuz they know my kind
Find it hard to figure me out
Look in my eyes
Look in my eyes

[Obie Trice]
Now when Obie's up to bat
They asked Obie
How you cope wit dat
Cope esthetically man
I Kobe Bryant rap
I'm so defiant that
The lungs uninviting my rhyme
I swear I'm outta my mind sometimes
Out on the grind
My kind
Nickel and dime niggaz we ain't rich yet
We on the corner wit a 40 and a biscuit
Ready for bitch shit
Have you drinkin
We ain't got good sense
My hood so tense
Niggaz so dense
I see through the life you invent
Slow up on how you niggaz vent
You niggaz ain't representin shit
I represent school crowd killas
Detroit nigga
My nigga what
The realest
Exploit niggaz
My nigga what
What's the point in avoidin your feelins
You niggaz fillas
You drillas
You a lyrics motherfuckers
Real life experiences
Eminem gave the clearance
So I here to show you niggaz brialliance
Build it
Shady marine no civilian
O Trice you fuckin wit a real one

[Chorus  Nate Dogg]

[Obie Trice]
This is what the streets done to me
Hungary
Gun on me
Hopes high only keep change up community
Give it up in unity
Raise future mes
You look in my eyes that's the dream Obie see
Man it seems
It's as easy as the rhyme Obie brings
But my eye shows things intervene
All or in between
It's like losin my team
Losin my freedom, losin my mind, and the being
The being I'm a being
Graduated from rights of beings
To a beance
Congratulated on life's irenes
On your biatch
I done came to far to go backwards
My aim to extreme for y'all

[Chorus  Nate Dogg]

[Obie Trice]
Look in my eys man
It ain't shit but real talk over here nigga
I would never send you elsewhere
I got hair on my nuts nigga
Grown man shit
That's how a nigga get into clubs nigga
When I ain't got no ID
Flash my nuts on they ass
They walk me right in nigga
Ha ha ha ha ha
Yea
