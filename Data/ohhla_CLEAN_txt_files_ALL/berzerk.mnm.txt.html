[Eminem]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes' on the ra-aaag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to - kick it!
Like a magician, critics I turn to - crickets!
Got 'em still on the fence whether to - picket!
But quick to get impaled, when I tell 'em - stick it!
So sick I'm lookin pale, oh that's my - pig-ment!
'Bout to go HAM, ya bish, shout out to - Kendrick!
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim - BITCH!
The art of emceein mixed with Da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend - BITCH!
Been +Public Enemy+ since you thought P.E. was gym - BITCH!

[Interlude: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
And {"go berzerk"} all night long!
Grow your beard out, just weird out
And {"go berzerk"} all night long!

[Chorus One: Eminem]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down so turn the volume loud
Cause it's, mayhem 'til the A.M.!
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself {"GO!"}
Let yourself gooo-ohh-ohh!
Say fuck it, before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
{"So everybody, everybody"} {"Go berzerk"}
{"Grab your vial, yeah!"}

[Eminem]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced, so I guess it ain't
that aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, checkmate
But girl your body's bangin, jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yessiree Bob, I was thinkin the same thang
So come get on this +Kid's Rock+, +Bawitdaba+, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chka-pow-chicka-wow-wow!
Got ya gal blowin up a val-v-v-val-valve!
Ain't slowin down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel!
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how how!
Least I know that I don't know, question is are you bozos
smart enough to feel stupid? Hope so
Now hoe

[Interlude]

[Chorus Two: Eminem]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down so turn the volume loud
Cause it's, mayhem 'til the A.M.!
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself {"GO!"}
Let yourself gooo-ohh-ohh!
Say fuck it, before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
{"So everybody, everybody"} {"Go berzerk"}
{"Grab your vial"}

{*scratched 2X*: "Everybody" - "Go berzerk"}

[Eminem]
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep, and woke up in that Monte Carlo
with the ugly Kardashian, Lamar oh
Sorry yo we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though
that's the past but I done did enough Codeine to knock +Future+ into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin to find a way to get you a-loan, CAR NOTE!
OHH~! Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangols and Car-heart-less cargoes
Girl you're fixin to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd ma'am; you bird-brain baby
I ain't called anybody "Baby" since Birdman - unless you're a swallow (haha)
Word Rick? Word man, you heard; but don't be discouraged girl
This is YOUR JAM, unless you got TOE JAM

[Interlude]

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]
