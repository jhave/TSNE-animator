The world, the world, the world is very diffrent now
The world, the world, the world is very diffrent now
The world, the world, the world is very diffrent now
The world, the world, the world is very diffrent now
The world, the world, the world is very diffrent now
The world, the world, the world is very diffrent now
The world, the world, the world is very diffrent now
The world, the world, the world is very diffrent now
The world, the world, the world is very diffrent now
  
Everybody want some paper [I want some]
Thats why we fightin over Paper [I know you want some]
And when you die, I bet you die trying to get some paper 
[I bet you would die, I bet you would die]
  
Shame shame
A fucked up game without the green
Mighty might dollar bill y'all, bill y'all
Have ya sinnin eventually in a coffin one day
But you came back to hustle 'cause niggas got bills to pay
Strugglin, strive
An try to stay alive
But in the meantime I'm gonna get mine
Everything will be fine when I can eat and get high
I may eat but I want to purchase some weed
And have a place to P.O.D. when I want to
But tryin to make the paper hate it on the world
I gotta keep my glock cocked
Niggas be plottin on me trying to hurt me
So I stop
But nigga whats up I'm in a hurry
No time for conversations with niggas just thinkin to murder me
But I pin them everytime [everytime]
Time after time
Just try trickin be deceased
No more your life
Friends, is usually your foes
You know you're just like evrybody I trust
Nobody, 'cause....
  
Everybody want some paper [I want some]
Thats why we fightin over Paper [I know you want some]
And when you die, I bet you die trying to get some paper 
[I bet you would die, I bet you would die]
  
Money money money
Make your, make your cash flow
Money money money
Make your, make your cash flow
Money money money
Make your, make your cash flow
Money money money
Make your, make your cash flow
  
My niggas don't you think it's funny sometimes
That you could be so quick to do a crime
You can come up and get robbed and shot
But you got the same job
Treat your buisness
Sometime you get your wig split
But shit
For the chedder I guess we just be willin to risk it
This is a stick up
Give up the cash
And while the purse nigga dash
Turned around and put a bullet up in your ass
Desperate ass niggas don't play
Me and my niggas it ain't al day
And you can go to the grave for mear play
Niggas play dirty 'cause we're out here hungry
We just want a meal on the table
And a mil in the pocket
You die if you cannot pay for your life
Niggas is fightin
And thats why....
  
Big hundred dollar bills y'all
Would you kill for them hundred dollar bills y'all
Big hundred dollar bills y'all
Would you kill for them hundred dollar bills y'all
Big hundred dollar bills y'all
Would you kill for them hundred dollar bills y'all
Big hundred dollar bills y'all
Would you kill for them hundred dollar bills y'all
  
Would you kill, would you kill, would you kill
For them hundred dollar bills y'all
Would you kill, would you kill, would you kill
For them hundred dollar bills y'all
  
Everybody want some paper [I want some]
Thats why we fightin over Paper [I know you want some]
And when you die, I bet you die trying to get some paper 
[I bet you would die, I bet you would die]
  
Better make your cash flow
Nigga better make your cash flow
Nigga make your money man
[Better hustle up and make your cash flow]
  
Fuck being poor</pre>
