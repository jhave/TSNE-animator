[Rev Run]
I got rhymes so def, and rhymes galore
Rhymes that you never even heard before
It's like this y'all - it don't stop
It's the surrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre SHOT! {*echoes*}

People want me rhymin must be out of they mind
They say I do it well and my rhymes are so fly
Gotta lot of bottom and my highs are so high
And when I tell 'em I don't wanna they just wanna know why
With a boom ditty ditty with the ditty the drum
The kiddies lookin for me cause they lookin for Run
I'm all up in the city, but you know where I'm from...

The H to the O, double-L I S
I know the boom batter 'bout to shatter your chest
The beater leader heater 'bout to make you go numb
With a boom ditty ditty, ditty ditty, ditty ditty...

[Chorus]
Boom ditty ditty with the ditty the drum
Boom boom ditty ditty boom ditty boom ditty ditty
Boom ditty ditty with the ditty the drum
The kiddies lookin for me cause they lookin for Run
Boom ditty ditty with the ditty the drum

[Rev Run]
Now I'm up and down the boule' and I'm fully aware
People lookin for me and they want me to care
They all up in my business and they thinkin it's fair
Can't a brother just retire, throw his mic in the air?
I pass it up to Diddy and the kiddies to come
My mic up in the kitty, no more rhymin for Run
Like a b-boy bangin slangin son of a gun
A gold chain hangin, no more bangin for Run
Boom swagger top bragger battle badder for me
Y'all beg a top batter make a fatter LP
The Rev'll never do it 'less I do it for delf
I gotta let'cha have it, go and manager yourself
Your army can't harm me, it ain't good for your health
So it's best y'all pass it on and put the mic on the shelf
With a

[Chorus]

[Rev Run]
Rhymin for my momma and the drama to come
Rhymin for Bambaataa and I'm rhymin for Run
Rhymin for my people up and under the gun
And when I'm rhymin for the money people know that it's
Done... done... done... done... DONE!</pre>
