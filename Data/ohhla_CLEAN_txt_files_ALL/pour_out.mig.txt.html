Song:   Pour Out the Seal
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Quavo]
We pour out the seal, we pour out the seal
I ran out of lean, I need a refill
We pour out the seal, we pour out the seal
I might call Pedro, I might call Phil
We pour out the seal, we pour out the seal
I ran out of lean, I need a refill
We pour out the seal, we pour out the seal
I might call Pedro, I might call Phil

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I'm drinking on this Actavis, my diamonds are immaculate
In the kitchen and I spilled the work, I made an accident
Kush smell like [?] my wrist retarded
Pull up in the party, wearing a carbon
You lookin' like you starving, my team we eating
20 bandz on my rollie and my wrist is speeding
Got Versace like a jungle my goons is hunters
And my momma said don't fuck with [?] stay away from ya
All these baby bottles and no toddlers in my house
And my nigga keep that Razorback like Arkansas
Lil mama mixed with black and white I call her Mickey Mouse
I'm trapping out the bando pull up at a leanhouse

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
That actavis, I'm smoking on cannabis
Lean, lean, lean, that's my medicine
My perfection of finnessing is excellent
Versace Versace Medusa my jacket no Letterman
I'm drinking on lean by the liter
You drink margaritas and sip on tequila
I call up the plug for the [?] in Spain I'm taking trips don't need Visa
[?] Tila Tequila
I'm walking with cash no Visa
I pour out the seal, I drink it for real, I do it you niggas pretenders
You niggas send message subliminals
The Audi, the Mazi you rented 'em
Dropping in Florida State I'm a seminar
Feds got my handcuffs on like a criminal
Lean, lean that's all I need promethazine codeine
Pull that chopper out he want to violent [?] the king

[Chorus]</pre>
