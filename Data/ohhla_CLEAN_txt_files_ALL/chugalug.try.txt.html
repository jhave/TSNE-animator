[Pastor Troy talking}
Pastor, disaster
I'm just laying down my bass shit
You know my bass my bass one
Y'all God damn (well UN-huh nigga)
Crank that bitch off the chain
Yeah, ya'll niggas know what time it is
PT in the house (nigga)
A yo and this is for everybody bustin' bottles
Give me a P, give me an A, give me a S, give me a T
Give me a P, give me a T

[Verse 1]
Hold up, wait a minute
Let PT, with gangsta in it
Fin'sta win it
I'm talkin' 'bout the trophy
Got me chillin' with this bitch name Sophie
She say she know me from one night in the Vail
Then say I was smokin', tellin' her to inhale it
Now that sounds like me
The mutha fuckin' Pastor nigga the ole G
DSGB tat' across my chest
And hell yeah nigga I put that shit in my flesh
The be for best, but these bustas just keep on poppin' 
Know when they play my shit the club rockin' 
You niggas watchin'
My thirty-two is in 'tact
Got that tuck between my dick and nut sack
I bet security didn't keep steppin' 
I'm on the dance floe' wit' my weapon
Chug-A-Lug

(Chorus 2x)
When I step off in the club we Chug-A-Lug
When I step off in the club we Chug-A-Lug
I'mma role up wit' these thugs that Chug-A-Lug
Puts a back in that mug we Chug-A-Lug

[Verse 2]
Nigga, yeah (yeah)
Ever seen a remmy bottle this big?
Just an imagine how it gone feel against ya' wig
?? pussy ass nigga, my nig'
Take another swig
Throw up my set
Dog tags hanging like a Vietnam vet'
Some bitches sweat
And some niggas looking dirty
Mad wit' me 'cause they in the club thirsty
I'm talkin' 'bout tongue hanging down to they throat
Broke ass nigga talkin' 'bout they saleing dope
Look hea' folk, let us leave the bar
If you ain't got no money, then take ya' ass to ya' car
Ya' dealing' with a star
Far from sulfa
Ya' catch me in a Benz or the Rover, it's ova
I buss a mutha fuckin bottle wit' my cuz'
Toast each other and Chug-A-Lug

(Chorus 2x)</pre>
