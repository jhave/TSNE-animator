[Intro] It's showtime!

[Chorus]
She ain't got no money in the bank
She be walkin round actin all stank
Now she at the party lookin at me
Hopin she could get saved by me
I'm lookin at her like I ain't tryin to save that girl (NO SIR!!!!)
I ain't tryin to save that girl (NO SIR!!!)
I ain't tryin to save that girl
She got her hand out but I ain't tryin to save that girl

[Verse 1]
Now... what y'all wanna do?
Wanna be ballers?  Shot-callers? Brawlers?
Give me your number I bet she 'gon call ya
Come on dog she want you to spoil her
Christian Dior or them new Fendi bags
Anything is good ccause it's better than she had
She sittin at the bar and she's lookin so sad
Talkin about, uh, I wanna ride in your jag
Uh uh uh, I wanna ride to your house
I said easy chick I fly to my house
I, live so far think I live down south
Why don't you pull it out my pants or put it in your mouth!!!

[Chorus]
She ain't got no money in the bank
She be walkin round actin all stank
Now she at the party lookin at me
Hopin she could get saved by me
I'm lookin at her like I ain't tryin to save that girl (NO SIR!!!!)
I ain't tryin to save that girl (NO SIR!!!)
I ain't tryin to save that girl
She got her hand out but I ain't tryin to save that girl

[Verse 2]
I see ya, you got the good shoes on
And your good dress on I mean you got your best on
I'm sittin at the back drinkin Vive and Clico
The Roselito, you know how we do
Before them bottles came you wasn't fuckin with my niggas
My homey say what's up you sayin nothin to my nigga
Come on girlfriend why you frontin for my niggas
It comes to the paper it's nothin to y noggas
Don't you know we got that(Money in the bank)... (I repeat)
D-D-D-Don't you know we got that (Money in the ban)
Man you ain't gettin nothin from me or my (Bank)
Better get you own, g-g-g-get out my face 

[Chorus]
She ain't got no money in the bank
She be walkin round actin all stank
Now she at the party lookin at me
Hopin she could get saved by me
I'm lookin at her like I ain't tryin to save that girl (NO SIR!!!!)
I ain't tryin to save that girl (NO SIR!!!)
I ain't tryin to save that girl
She got her hand out but I ain't tryin to save that girl

[Verse 3]
It's started out soft and warm
Don't get excited I've been invited to the quiet storm
And, now it's out of hand cause she told me she hate me
And then she said what the hell i done lately
First she said all she need is love and affection
Let me be your angel, and I'll be your protection
Took her out bought her all kinds of things
But it wasn't enough, so this the song I sing cause she broke

[Chorus]
She ain't got no money in the bank
She be walkin round actin all stank
Now she at the party lookin at me
Hopin she could get saved by me
I'm lookin at her like I ain't tryin to save that girl (NO SIR!!!!)
I ain't tryin to save that girl (NO SIR!!!)
I ain't tryin to save that girl
She got her hand out but I ain't tryin to save that girl</pre>
