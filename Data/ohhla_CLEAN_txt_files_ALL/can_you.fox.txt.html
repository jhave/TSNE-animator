[Pretty Boy]
My peoples is watching you, watching me
Lots of envy and hate is what it got to be
I heard you tryin' to destroy my whole monopoly
But if I take it to your face, you 'gon cop a plea
I know it, but it's cool, I know to watch you close
And if it comes to extremes I always got my toast
But you don't know that I know that you's a evil nigga
Cuz I'm laughin' and frontin' like I believe you, nigga
You be thinkin' you fresh in your Moschino wear
And if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be nowhere
Huh, even ya crew knows you just too soft
I'm just waitin' for the right time to cut you off, for real
So keep thinkin' forever you'll be down
But if you know this 'bout you, you betta kill me now
I'm sayin' 50 percent of my niggaz think it's them
And if you think it ain't you, you betta think again
Uh... 

1  - 	Niggaz I roll with
	Niggaz I stole with
	Niggaz that hold shit
	Niggaz that blow chicks, can you feel me baby?
	(When you inside me Pretty)
	Can I trust you baby?
	(I never lie Pretty)
	Plus you stay jiggy
	(You keep me fly Pretty)
	And I'mma treat you like my fifth on my side baby
	And I'mma take you on some trips to the sky baby
	And no matter what we do (ya know ya mine baby)

[Foxy Brown]
If it ain't my dogs, I ain't fuckin' with 'em, shit
Bitches ain't my crew? I ain't fuckin' with 'em
Think I trust ya'll canivin' bitches, starvin' bitches
Always got ya eyes on my wrist-ass bitches
Think cuz a bitch rap I won't lay out bitches
Down with the 4 pound, and spray out bitches
Everything ain't rap, ya'll is some snake-ass bitches
I ain't playin' with all ya'll hoes, OK, ya'll bitches?
Swing back through the hood, got the game back
Niggaz front the bodega, yellin' "Fox get ya name back, baby"
Brooklyn nigga, bet our stash you
Young chicks ballers since tailors and Lee patches, 'member that?
Quarter juices, 3 quarter buy my gooses
Two finger rings with ya two-tone jeans, frontin' like it's nuthin'
When everybody was born, now ya hold's fallin' 
And wanna knock 'me for mines

Repeat 1

[Pretty Boy]
Uh, now I wonda, am I at my peak?
Is it just a dream or are they really after me?
Is it real? You never know what lies ahead of you
I'm kinda young but my heart beats irregular
What do I do? Do I sit here and die slow?
They tried to kill me mixin' angeldust and hydro'
My eyes closed, what I'm sayin' must be sinkin' in
And if it didn't nigga, take ya time and think again
Uh...

Repeat 1 until fade</pre>
