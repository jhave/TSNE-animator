[Warren G]
Sometimes I sit back and think about how it was
When I was young, I used to think it was you I couldn't live without
Somehow, life took a sad route
Sometimes the wind blows bad enough to take a plane down
Your straight bullets killed children on playgrounds
Bullshit got me about to smoke a whole pound
Meanwhile, I smile, hoping I can rebound
Somehow the LBC streets ain't the same now, without you
Things ain't been the same since you ain't around
But I stay strong game tight, hold it down
Warren G, I never played a blackground
This song is fucked up, because you gone

[Chorus: El DeBarge]
Oooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
Oooh, It makes me reminsce
Over and over, again and again

[Warren G]
Nothing means more to me, than family
When one lost, its sad to see, damn its me
A friend you will always be
Above all things, you taught me to persue my dreams
With joy it brings, at times when I sit and think
I know inside you smiled down, proud at me
I just need one more drink, damn
At night I can't sleep, I admit that its hard to eat
It's all good, I ain't trippin'
Tried to show me the right laws and guidelines
But I ain't listen, I'm sitting here lavishing and living
And I'd give it all back because you still missing

[Chorus: El DeBarge]

[Warren G]
Lord please hear me, ease my soul
I woke up one day and my mom was gone
I'm in the zone wishing I could call your home
Sing your song, tell ya that I'm out on tour
All alone, I just needed to hear your voice on the phone
Mother and son, though I'm grown
Life moves on, I need you mom, a quiet storm
Differences and right and wrong
As I move on, since Warren G ain't gone
The stitch is on, set the tone, the page I'm on
Is having fun, having a ball, living life
I'm still here, wishing you was home

[Chorus: El DeBarge]
Over, over, over, over, over
Again, again, I miss you
Ohhh mama, don't know, don't care
How I keep it strong, keep moving on
Keepin' it strong, keep movin' it on
Keepin' it strong, keep movin' it on
Keepin' it strong, keep movin' it on
Keepin' it strong, keep movin' it on, mama</pre>
