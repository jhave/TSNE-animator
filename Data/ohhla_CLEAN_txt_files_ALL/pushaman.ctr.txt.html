[Chance The Rapper]
Ten -- damn -- days
And all I got to show for it is shoes and shows and chauffeurs with road rage
Still the same damn ad-lib: IGH! Old, ways
Still gotta letterman, no practice; still gotta burner man, no lackin'
Still outtin Jams nigga, no Jackson; no Jordan and we toe-taggin'
I'll take you to the land where the lake made of sand and the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance and the money ain't yours
Now its just a red pill, got a blue and a hand full of Advils
I'm the new Nitty, fuck it Nitty the old me so I'mma tell the buyer what Nitty told me

[Chorus 2X: Nate Fox - second time chopped and screwed]
I got that mmm-mmm, I got that Goddamn
I'm yo' pusha man, I'm yo', I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm yo' pusha man, I'm yo', I'm yo' pusha man

[Nate Fox - chopped and screwed]
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm yo' pusha man, I'm yo', I'm yo' pusha man

[Chance The Rapper]
You a laaaaaaaame, and your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets, in the tweets and a Reader or a RedEye if you read Sun-Times
She got blisters on her knees, she's a fiend for the D even though I only beat one time
One time, it was one two times, it was two plus me equals threesome time
Shouts out to Nate, I jackball and I bop, I flex
Got neck from all these thots I sex; Rastafari them shottas yes
House safari, mi casa, yes; poppy fields of that popeye
She came to party, she popped a Molly, said "come to papa", she said "papa, yes"

[Chorus]</pre>
