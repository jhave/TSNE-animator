[Playa]
We can go on and on

[Erick Sermon] 
Ah ha, one two y'all

[Too Short]    
Uh uh, nobody, ah

[Eric Sermon]
Woo, woo, this is E, Short Dog and Sweat
We vets
Coming through, hot to death, place your bets
Baguettes swing from the neck
Make wanna-be playas show us mad respect (word up)
Yo, dog (whassup?)
He daughter said it's cheaper to keep her
If she gets fly then, hmmmm
(leave her)
E, G hooked it up, Short dog and Sweat
Got the average girl wanna inhale and catch her breath
(What, what, what, what)

[Playa]
1 - 	We can go on and on
	We can go on and on
	Don't sleep on 
	Our love jones
	Cuz we got it goin' on
	You know it ain't wrong

	We can go on and on
	We can go on and on and on and on 
	Our love jones
	Not to be sleepin' on 
	We can go along
	
[Keith Sweat]
In the morning when the sunlight hits my eyes
I just lay there thinkin' how your lovin' keeps me in a jive
Ain't no question, you can love me baby
Like nobody can
What you do to me, my baby girl
I just don't understand
Now we can go on

Repeat 1

I would never ever, baby do you wrong (ha)
In the midnight hour I will always keep this lovin' strong
Just surrender your love, baby girl, and I'll surrender mine
All I wanna do right now, my girl, is baby, take my time
(Huh, nah-mean, word up)
So we can go on

Repeat 1

[Too Short]
Hey, yo baby
Ain't got no tatoos
But when I walk in the room they pose like statues
I size 'em all up, I used to take my pick
But now I'm on some high powered new improved shit
Deep down inside, it never goes away
I just might knock a few hoes today
It's ok, I really get pay makin' phone calls
Told you once before, I'm in it for the long haul
The last in the business, make the transition
Do I have what it takes 
Or do you have the right intentions to git with a playa
Even if it means you gotta play the back ground so you can see some green
No video's or groupies, who ever got the talent
Rush her to the house and let her pose for the camera
Don't let the freak in you keep you up all night
Get your money on girl, don't waste your life

Repeat 1 until fade</pre>
