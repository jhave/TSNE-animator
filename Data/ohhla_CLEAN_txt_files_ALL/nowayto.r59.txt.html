[Intro: Royce]
From as far back as I can remember
Me and my man Vishis
We was always taught to shoot for the stars
The game is ours, M.I.C. (c'mon!)

[Chorus 2X: Royce Da 5'9"]
Can't nobody stop me, uh-uh
No way to stop me, uh-uh
Can't nobody stop me, uh-uh
Ain't no way to stop me, uh-uh

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Long as the checks stay ill and the records stay real
I'ma definitely never see how second place feels
I'm a striver, I learn from my father to burn like lava
I am a survivor, the problem
is that, even as a kid I've been meanin
to be the, heir to the chair that the king's in
I vowed to myself that, I wouldn't melt
I will rise to the top, of the pile myself
{"C'mon!"} Can't nobody stop my wealth
My dreams or, team up without my help
For sure it's better to chase ya
I base this, on pure competitive nature
Waitin, for the day that we make plans
to compete, win or lose shake hands
These are the views of the dudes of tomorrow who will win 
cause they shoot for the stars and refuse, to lose!

[Chorus]

[Kid Vishis]
Yeah, yeah
As long as the checks stay ill and the records stay real
I'ma definitely never see how second place feel
Got the mind of a rhymer, conquer your roster
Squad full of mobsters as hungry as a hostage
Yeah, I will never fear
cause I need to succeed, you could tell in my stare
that I care if I lose, I'm a winner so I move with a vision
Never fool with the timid, rather learn so I listen
{"C'mon!"} Can't stop my mission
Too vicious for you who step into the trenches
Raw, talent - never back down
Bring the challenge, I'ma leave standin
Laughin at y'all faces cause y'all mad
But dirty looks, will never shake this man
Full steam ahead for the cake, for the bread 'til I'm fed
Go hard at 'em all and refuse, to lose!

[Chorus]

{"C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!"}

[Royce Da 5'9"] + (Kid Vishis)
Long as the checks stay ill (and the records stay real)
I'ma definitely never see how (second place feel)
The league (the teams) fatigue (breathe)
Believe in song {"C'mon!"}
For sure it's better to chase ya
I base this, on pure competitive nature
(You can lose your shoes) Givin crews the blues
(Go hard at 'em all and refuse, to lose!)
