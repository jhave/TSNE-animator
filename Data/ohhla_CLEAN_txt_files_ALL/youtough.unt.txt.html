[Hook: 50 Cent]
Yeah
Nigga you so tough
Tough until your heartbeat stop
The tre pound pop, your arteries shot
You bleed into shock, get in the pine box
Damn you's a hard motherfucker
You so tough
Tough until your punk ass hit
The 4 fifth kick, the Hechler spit
You in deep shit, oh now your ass sick
You supposed to be hard motherfucker

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Bury all your hatin, cuz hatred will bury ya
Learn not to talk tough talk through your cellular
Fucked then beef, the president and senator
There is no peace, youre the prey or the predator
While you plottin on me, I'm 10 steps ahead of ya
Black 40 caliber I put a infrared on ya
Nigga I'm special, you mad cuz ya regular
Man I don't want your bitch, I damn near remember her
Refresh my memory, oh yeah I slept with her
No wonder she ain't mention you when I met with her
Mind on my cheddar, they'll remember me forever
The groundwork I put in made my lifestyle better..and better
I like the fuckin street, bright in the phantom lights
Montana light, two women in {?} lights, they round the planet twice
But I don't forget where I come from dum dum dum

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
For that china white I lay a nigga mama down
We can shoot it out like Frank White did in Chinatown
You know I got that hard white, you know I got that tan n brown
Automatic tre pound leave a nigga man down
Murder murder, homicide, real right niggas ride
Gangstas they never hide, thank God I'm still alive
My pocket look like theres cracks on me
My waist look like I got the MAC on me
These hoes on my dick I got that ass on me
You a RN: regular nigga that rap homey
I'm crack homey, I'm dope money
I wake up and wipe my ass with dope money
C Back, Maybach, my shit two tone
Nigga run up on that, your ass a tombstone
I'm hood like a group home, ghetto like a pay phone
Jake The Snake I'm low in the hood from em

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Yeah I got a knife for a tough nigga, 9 for a hard nigga
Don't make me empty the chamber
Even if I'm locked in the cell-block, they fallin' the shell shock
When I open your head with the banger
I cause a riot in the yard, make a mess in the mess hall
I got just blew trial and I ain't got nothin' left
Whats todays mathematics? shit ain't addin' up
Get knocked with 10 machine guns only get 12 months
Ooooh weee, don't talk to me, you talk to him, you talkin' to them
I got the best lawyers money can buy
They said they would've got me 10, or maybe 9
I said "How do you explain how homey breeeze?"
They said keep ya mouth shut or you eatin' the cheese</pre>
