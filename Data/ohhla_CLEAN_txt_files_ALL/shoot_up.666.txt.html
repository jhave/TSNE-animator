[Chorus: Crunchy Black]
Ain't no hoe up in me nigga bitch stay out of my fucking way
Ain't no hoe up in me nigga bitch stay out of my fucking way
Ain't no hoe up in me nigga bitch stay out of my fucking way
Ain't no hoe up in me nigga bitch stay out of my fucking way

[Crunchy Black]
I went to the club
Fucking with a scrub
Wanna tote pistols
And smoke bud
Went inside just for a minute
He was like Popeye he had to eat his spinach
Then the police they had to get in it
Just my luck my windows was tinted
Security saw him
Him put the junk
In the stash spot
Mane he should not have got jumped

[Frayser Boy]
It's a late Sunday night I'm at the club posted up
Got them thangs in the car
You get wrong and get fucked
Kinda drunk kinda high
On the edge so don't try
Show your ass in the club
When you leave you gone die
Besta dip before I dip
Please don't let me leave first
When you come out it's like summer when I let the heat burst
Put you underneath work
You gone swear you need church
You the first up out the club
You the one to bleed first

[Chorus]

[Lil Wyte]
Run up in this motherfucker
Shoot it up from roof to floor
Make the bullets scatter through the crowd
And hit them head to toe
Where it will stop nobody knows
That's the beauty part of it
You mad about the drama we inflict but bitch you started it
I roll with HCP
And that's the only gang I claim
Think I ain't serious about this bitch
It's tatted in my veins
And that's for life
Get your shit right before you get fucked up
To start a fight
Get your click tight before you hit the club
I spit the facts and that's for real
And I ain't just running my mouth
Once them bullets start ripping I bet your click run to your house
Now your all alone
With a bunch of killers in an empty building
Should have listened to this song before you left your wife and children
Pay attention
Maybe living can be worked into your schedule
Playahatian got you waiting to be dancing with the devil
Life is crazy when you tamper with the ones that keep you float
Keep your ears and eyes up in it
And don't forget to guard your throat (Bitch)

[Chorus]

[Juicy J]
Memphis niggaz tearing your motherfuckin spot up
Memphis niggaz bucking AKs burn the block up
Yeah we be wild as a fool in the courthouse
But in the club we have the clackup clackup thangs out
Mane this shit ain't funny
Cause niggaz need money
And club owners making all the cash gimme something
I'm riding down Poplar it's a club to my left
A little mix junt
I think I'll jack it by myself (Bitch)

[DJ Paul]
Now when they talk about Memphis and who represent it
They talk about The Hypnotize Minds and the Grizzlies
A lot of rappers in my city want my crown
But they ain't sold no records and they pockets ain't round
The only thing that they can rap is Reynolds
The only new cars they can ride is rentals
I got three houses in Memphis and one in Florida
A condo in Cali bitch can you afford us
Hell naw

[Chorus]

[Juicy J]
Nigga North North niggaz ain't barrin' that shit
Nigga South Memphis niggaz ain't barrin that shit
Nigga West Memphis niggaz ain't barrin that shit
Nigga East Memphis niggaz ain't barrin that shit

Nigga North North niggaz ain't barrin' that shit
Nigga South Memphis niggaz ain't barrin that shit
Nigga West Memphis niggaz ain't barrin that shit
Nigga East Memphis niggaz ain't barrin that shit
