[Into: (Memphis Bleek)]
Ya know, it's the... ROC (bounce)
Yea I see ya, let's go... drop one
Yeah, Yo, Yo..

[Chorus: (Memphis Bleek)]
1, 2 y'all, you know I rock ya
Step in the rounds of the ROC mafia

Yea... Yea... Yea

[Memphis Bleek]
I tote P89's on me all the time
My rhymes is serious I'm kill'em every time
While I'm... sunk in that 745
I am... feel like a jet when I ride (when I ride)
So I ride nigga feel me on cruise control
Game tight nigga lose your hoe
I smoke... take a few pulls of the refer
Ridin under the tint doin the duece fever
Need some so I check the beeper
Before B.I.G. pasted he passed the number to Katrina
Get it right the game still remain
And I'm married to the shit, you niggas still engaged
Nothin change, twelve gauge still POP!
If you niggas wanna jump at the ROC!
You can come witcha BLOCK! If you want to
Yea Ease the same
I bet it all on dice so I could freeze the chain (now thats game)
All you hoes is a show (your truck come with a chaffeur?) Ma fa'sho
You know Ease the truth, they say sex is a weapon
You'll be dead when I shoot

[Chorus: (Memphis Bleek)]
1, 2 y'all, you know I rock ya
Step in the rounds of the ROC mafia
1, 2 y'all, you know I stop ya
Dirty Get Low nigga we gotcha
1, 2 y'all (y'all) uh

1, 2 y'all (y'all) uh
Yea... Yea... Yea

[Geda K]
Yea... Yea..
It's Get Low and the ROC ain't a click out touchin'em
Doe doublin bitch niggas not discussin'em
Block tick rabbit when I'm finger fuckin'em
Fuck a vest, tell ya boys have a bullet proof truck with'em
It's Geda K the young horse, and M. Ease of course we gettin cheese
Draw we don't squeeze, and SUV's on two-fours with t.v.'s
Probably with your bitch, playin the backseat
And you know I hit it, ain't the type to chill with it
Type to get rid of and never go to the crib with her
Shit, I move according to plans and still visit... park
And still kick it and pick my niggas up
And you know we be dro smokin, toten, loc'n
Live from PR or Oakland, bitch its Get Low let me know whats up
If you get it the truck get in postion to fuck
I'm ghetto, Hero Flynn, hot like heroin, young pimps thoro'in
I pimp through their boroughs in
Ya better keep your chicks intact... cause I walk like a pimp, talk like a mack

[Chorus: (Memphis Bleek) + *Lil' Cease*]

Hand gun with silencers, ride up on the side of ya
Flash this gun up in ya face like photographers (camera flash noise)
Stay in the hood with ice, ain't noboby robbin us
When it come to rappin ain't noboby stoppin us dog (Ha Haaa!)
It's ROC mafia who live as us, Jay ridin on side, B.I.G. on top of us

Uh Oh..
Raps in trouble, HOV bout to double back
And lock the streets again,ain't no police and him
Got cops on the payroll, killers on the lay low
Niggas becareful what you sayin on LayYy LowWw
Are nextel radio niggas have'em at the radio before you exhale nigga
The cats out the bag, but blast out the mag
Send them words back in your mouth... out ya ass
Talkin shit, all you get is cleaned the fuck up
I ain't steamed the fuck up either
Hire the team but me, myself, and I-rene
I come through and lean you fucker, I'm tryin to keep niggas from killing you
You still talkin shit to me, you now as smart as you appear to be
I got dum-dums for dumb-dumbs
I'm a right man, got a educated left hook in a right hand
Fuck like whoa, got a flow like damn
The new thug life be the Roc-A-Fella fam
No disrespect intended
But if you offended can't take it back...  handle your business
I'm just staten facts, the whole worlds against us
And we will not surrender, and we will survive
Turn out ya lights like Teddy Penta-Grass
Get ready for the coldest winter ass, I proceed..

[Chorus: (Memphis Bleek)]
Yea, Yo, Yo..
1, 2 y'all, you know I rock ya
Step in the rounds of the ROC mafia
