YEAHHHHHHHH
I'm chillin wit my nigga tonight
I'm chillin wit my nigga tonight
YEAHHHHHHHH
I'm chillin wit my nigga tonight

My girls goin' out tonight, (YEAHHHHHHHH) but Ima fall back tonight
Me and my man takin it in tonight... yea we gon get it in tonight
We gon smoke something, drink something, toast something
So he can beat the pussy up like it stole something
Get it poppin all night til like 4 somethin
And then we right back at it 'round 6 somethin
It's supposed to be girls night out
So you know he got my girlfriends cursing me out
Sayin that I'm whipped and he turnin' me out
No need for the gym cuz he be workin me out
For me, he got a huge appetite
Lick my ice cream like a tasty delight
The bond between us is tight
I heard Duve poppin tonight but...

I ain't goin to the club or hangin wit my girls
I'm chillin wit my nigga tonight
R. Kelly got a show, but I cant go
I'm chillin wit my nigga tonight
Victoria Secret lingerie on
Layin up wit my nigga tonight
We bout to get it on, turn off the phone
It's all about my man tonight

Tonight its just me and my boo
Candlelight dinner, sippin some wine too
Lingerie see-through you know how I do
Playin slow jams to set the mood
Some Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, a little Anita
In the bed laughin at Martin and Gina
All eyes on us like we Brad and Angelina, no one can come between us
The things he do give me the chills
Like writin out I Love You in hundred dollar bills
He don't even think about playin the field
He in ecstasy without takin a pill
He treats me like a queen I love the way he courts me
Makin love in the Ferrari he just bought me
Playin play station, fight night
I heard Stereo poppin tonight but...

I ain't goin to the club or hangin wit my girls
I'm chillin wit my nigga tonight
R. Kelly got a show, but I cant go
I'm chillin wit my nigga tonight
Victoria Secret lingerie on
Layin up wit my nigga tonight
We bout to get it on, turn off the phone
It's all about my man tonight

From the bed, to the kitchen, to the living room couch
We done blessed every room in this New York penthouse
Miami estate, house by the lake
We ain't watchin pornos we watchin our own sex tape
I pour the Henny all over his jimmy
So when he stick it in me, he's drunk off of Kimmy
I make a nigga bust faster than a semi
Cuz Kimmy get the jimmy rock harder than a penny (UGHH)
Full body massage, champagne bubble bath
Then we make love on a bed made of cash
He can't get enough, he's always ready to smash
He love how I'm shaped just like a hourglass
His niggas is tight he chillin with his wife
But they don't come before the love of his life
We in the crib havin a pillow fight
I heard Lotus is poppin tonight but...

I ain't goin to the club or hangin wit my girls
I'm chillin wit my nigga tonight
R. Kelly got a show, but I cant go
I'm chillin wit my nigga tonight
Victoria Secret lingerie on
Layin up wit my nigga tonight
We bout to get it on, turn off the phone
It's all about my man tonight</pre>
