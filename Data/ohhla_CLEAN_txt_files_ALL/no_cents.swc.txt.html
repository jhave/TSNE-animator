[Master P - Intro] 
Whatsup niggaz? 
This the colonel(hu-haha) 
Mr. M-P(nigga)(haha) 
Come 1 come all, TRU niggaz ball(I told y'all) 
I know there's niggas out there waitin' for the fall 
(Y'all can't stop a motherfuckin' Tank) 

[Hook - Master P] 
After Dollars, no cents 
From Chev's to Bents 
From cheddar to cheese 
Tryin' to pay the rent 

After Dollars, no cents 
From Chev's to Bents 
From cheddar to cheese 
Nigga tryin' to pay the rent 

[Master P - Verse 1] 
I'ma hustler, baller, nigga G'z and cut ki's 
Gats for enemies, freeze! hundred degreez 
Kill, robbery, soldier- born to ride 
Killer- born to die, Mama- was born to cry 
Wild like a long fuckin' ranger 
Niggaz from the South keep one up in the chamber 
Lord knows, when your enemy is quittin' 
That's why niggaz watchin' nigga's back, 
cause they gone on that powder shit 
Caine, nigga's gang, heroin in the vain 
Fuckin' with they brains 
Who the next nigga to get popped by a cop? 
Who the next nigga in the hood to get shot? 
I hope it ain't me, so I'm strapped up in bulletproof 
Nigga on my stomach see - Motherfuckin' T.R.U. 
Soldier til I die, fuck it I won't cry 
Look my ENEMY, in the eye 
Fuck every nigga that ain't real, cause we bout it 
And if I have to die, cause a nigga gone shout it 
I was born a No Limit Soldier, from heart 
Cowards run they mouth, but killers don't talk 

[Hook - Master P] 
After Dollars, no cents 
From Chev's to Bents 
From cheddar to cheese 
Tryin' to pay the rent 

After Dollars, no cents 
From Chev's to Bents 
From cheddar to cheese 
Tryin' to pay the rent 

[Master P - Verse 2] 
You know Kriss, I'm Kross 
Y'all ran, we walked 
No Limit niggaz got ghetto dope by pounds and bults 
Blowin' tapes up in flames, like weed 
Got box albums up like ki's, from the South to overseas 
Niggaz independant, and rowdy 
Nigga check billboard, number 1 and bout it 
That's why niggaz tryin' to get us on the radio 
Now niggaz might see the P. on the video 
But a nigga, still TRU to the Gizzame 
Cause I, represent the hood and every fuckin' nigga that gangbang 
The streets is so real, fool guard yo grill 
Smoke one for the homies that done made it over the hill 
Cause we..... 

[Hook - Master P] 
After Dollars, no cents 
From Chev's to Bents 
From cheddar to cheese 
Tryin' to pay the rent 

After Dollars, no cents 
From Chev's to Bents 
From cheddar to cheese 
Tryin' to pay the rent 

[Silkk The Shocker - Verse 3] 
After...Dollars no cents, we representin', No Limit 
Put a dime rolex presidential, nigga ride everythang ??? 
Nigga I went from riches to riches 
Not motherfuckin' rags to riches 
Cause I, always had money 
Cause I, always had bitches 
Yeah a motherfuckin' nigga tryin' to get mo' dough 
Nigga act like you know the motherfuckin' sco' though 
I pull a ice solo, hit a 40 G lo 
Lay-low pro, get a Benz, too dope 
??????, gold Tank, crush diamonds, and mo mo's 
Nigga runnin' from the po po's, hidin' from a lo lo' 
Takin' trips together to the ??? 
Fa'sho though, puttin' a vest up under my Polo 
Nigga strapped with the 4 when I'm solo 
To test the best, then that's a no no 
365 days, 24/7, I'm bout my riches 
See money, is a must, everything's a plus, includin' weed and bitches 
It went from 18/5 a ki, not 18/5 for me, C and P to do a show 
Act like y'all know, Ghetto Millionaire, 
shippin gold out the do', you know?
