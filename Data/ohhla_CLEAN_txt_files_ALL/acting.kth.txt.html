Report to the Commi$$ion, yeah!
The motherfucker's in the house
Black mask... knahmsayin long coat... trench~!
Bitch rapper female rapper or male rapper I don't give a fuck

[vocal sample]
Far as gangsta rappers man I'm not feelin that
It's hard for me to turn around and feel anybody that front like they a gangsta
Y'know I y'know I put some unnecessary work out there
From 69 all the way to 85 a little past that
Y'knahmean so it be hard for some guy to come in the 80's
talkin 'bout he a gangsta, they all need to turn around and come together
and quit actin like lil' ol' broads
Act like lil' ol' broads and shit like this here, and leave all this stuff alone
If you gon' make music, y'know c'mon, bring it on home
Y'know when a nigga turn around advocatin all that
Y'know kinda shit like they so hard and shit
It makes a real soldier know man that you nothin but a whore

[Keith - voice lowered]
Whore, I got the Halloween streets
I can deal with the toughy rought niggaz, actin like they own these streets
Spittin on gay producer tracks
Everybody's fans all shrimp
Niggaz, dress hard and act grimy
but they rap on top of Vagisil cream beats
I refuse to get on yo' shit
Pull my pants down, and shit on whatever you spit
I love the agony, you fucked up! With the dragon B
Tail fifteen feet long, fuckin with dragon B
like Spot under the stairs, blowin fire at Herman
Aunt Lily makin peach cobby
Watch Dennis Roddy rebound over the green gobby
Fryin people with Mazola corn oil is my hobby
Fuck females rappin rugged with hair on they face
Chicks need Cortizone 7 motherfucker you ain't fly
but your stomach is sloppy, I'm in the streets catchin sales
Out the ass they call me Shoppy McGroppy the best hip-hoppy
Fuck your shoes and your socky, dinner table reserved
Appointment to eat I cancel my order
Pickin in your nose you wipin on it with the skillet you fuckin creep
Ugly bitch with an elephant booty
Thought she prolly knew me

Spend the winter workin out with Milwaukee, let me call Bry-an
Turn off the faucets, let me talk to your girl, with dry hands
I'm more fascinatin than 600 live bands
I don't want your Viper I'm searchin on the web over, Pontiac demands
When you perform only I see three hands
You make four to add to the collection, I ship rappers
Ground transport, wrong place, here your zip code correction
Fuck your selection... BITCH~!</pre>
