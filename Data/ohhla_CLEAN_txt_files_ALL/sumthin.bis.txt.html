[Intro] [Bishop talking]
Lucas, Gripsta, we gonna keep it rollin' man, hit after hit nigga
It's called +Sumthin'+ man
There's somethin' about the way these bitches be doin' what they do to me
Lord have mercy. Bless you hoes
Bless you hoes, I mean that, I mean that in the most spiritual sense I can
Bless you hoes for the gifts you've been blessed with
Let's get into it nigga.

[Verse One]
Awe yeah here we go
1, 2, 3 all the freaks to the flo'
Even though I know you heard this befo'
Bend over to the front and touch your toes
A little stretch exercise
The bend will get you nice when we got crushin' in my ride
Don't be ashamed to shift it into drive
They can't see, my truck too high
I love it when you do it on the freeway, freeway, freeway, freeway
I love it when you do it on the freeway, freeway, freeway
Swervin' in and out the lane
I'm mean Borg, gettin' crazy brain
I'm your Motrin when in pain
Come take me, I'll kill your migraine

[Chorus]
There's somethin' about the way you do that dance
There's just somethin' about the way your ass looks inside those pants
There's just somethin' about the way you rub yourself with your hands
There's just somethin' about the way you're starin' got me in a trance

[Verse Two]
Life can be such a bore
Let's talk about sex 'nuff about war
Bin Laden this and Bin Laden that
How 'bout a new story on asses to fat
Yeah
Let's see
An interview with Trina, Buffy and Cherokee
Now wouldn't that be fresh?
And all three competin' in an ass tappin' contest
Let's go live to the strip club, strip club, strip club
I'm gonna get my dick rubbed, dick rubbed
Come over here and strip love
On all four 
Make love not war, war
I ain't no politician, I'm a ballatician, you got me wishin'
You and me can try a brand new position
You know what she was doin' walkin',  ass swishin'

There's somethin' about the way you do that dance
There's just somethin' about the way your ass looks inside those pants
There's just somethin' about the way you rub yourself with your hands
There's just somethin' about the way you're starin' got me in a trance

[Verse Three]
Jessica Alba
Jessica Simpson
Your little sister too if she's out there listenin'
Gabrielle Union
Eva Mendez
Tyra, Janet show me the other breast
Pretty please
With sugar on top
Pretty please
I promise I won't touch, I'll just watch
On your knees
When you crawl over to the couch
Pull your undies to the side, let me turn you out
Got the camera set up if you wanna make a flick
Got the pole over there if you wanna go and strip
We home alone, you got me singin' like Thick
I wanna fuck you girl, I wanna fuck you girl
Excuse my rudeness, excuse my lewdness
But I'm just a freak who really loves to do it
Do it so good your whole body get the jitters
When I ask you how it was you say, "Excellent Smithers"

[Chorus]
There's somethin' about the way you do that dance
There's just somethin' about the way your ass looks inside those pants
There's just somethin' about the way you rub yourself with your hands
There's just somethin' about the way you're starin' got me in a trance</pre>
