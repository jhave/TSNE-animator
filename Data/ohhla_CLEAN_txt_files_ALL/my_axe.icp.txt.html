(Violent J)  
I love my Faygo, I love pills, Shaggy, 
I love my buddies, my hatchetman but I love my axe 

(Violent J) 
My axe is my buddy, I bring him when I walk, 
Me and my axe will leave your head outlined in chalk, 
My axe is my buddy, he always makes me laugh, 
Me and my axe cut biggots spinal cords in half, 
My axe is my buddy, and when I wind him back, 
Me and my axe will give your forehead a buttcrack, 
My axe is my buddy, I never leave without him, 
Me and my axe will leave your neck a bloody fountain, 

(Violent J, and Shaggy 2 Dope) 

Chorus: 
Everybody, everybody, everybody run, 
Murdering, murdering, murdering fun, (everybody dies) 
Swing swing swing, chop chop chop, (everybody dies) 
Swing swing swing, chop chop chop, 
Everybody, everybody, everybody run, 
Murdering, murdering, murdering fun, (everybody dies) 
Swing swing swing, chop chop chop, (everybody dies) 
Swing swing swing, chop chop chop, 

(Violent J) 
My axe is my buddy, we right planets wrongs, 
Me and my axe leave biggots deads on richies lawns 
My axe is my buddy, he never make me cry, 
Me and my axe will leave a bivot for your eye, 

(Violent J) 
Ouch, Ouch, Ouch, Ouch 
Ouch, Ouch, Ouch, Ouch 
Ouch, Ouch, Ouch, Ouch, 
Ouch, Ouch, Ouch, Ouch 
Tylenol, Tylenol, Tylenol, Tylenol 
Tylenol, Tylenol, Tylenol, Tylenol 

(Violent J) 
My axe is my buddy, don't take him for a chump, 
Me and my axe will leave you hopping on a stump 

Chorus: 

(Violent J, and Shaggy 2 Dope) 
Look into the deadest tree, tell me baby what you see, 
Dont't you hear the branches cry? Asking for the reasons why, 
If they hang so many men, from the branches off of them, 
Why did humans make them play, with them in their evil way, 
Look into the moons beam, can you fathom what its seen? 
Bodies draging from a truck, driven by a biggot fuck, 
Why you think that heavens cry, acid rain and blizzard sky 
Ain't no covering tracks, and thats why I'm here, and oh yes.. 

(Violent J) 
My axe is my buddy, he'll thump into your head, 
Me and my axe will make your white pony's red, 
My axe is my buddy, you let that ditzy wave 
Me and my axe will fuck your mother on your grave 

(Violent J) 
Ouch, Ouch, Ouch, Ouch 
Ouch, Ouch, Ouch, Ouch 
Ouch, Ouch, Ouch, Ouch, 
Ouch, Ouch, Ouch, Ouch 
Tylenol, Tylenol, Tylenol, Tylenol 
Tylenol, Tylenol, Tylenol, Tylenol 

(Violent J) 
My axe is my buddy, we both cry with the trees 
Me and my axe will bring the devil to his knees 

Chorus: 
Everybody, everybody, everybody run, 
Murdering, murdering, murdering fun, (everybody dies) 
Swing swing, chop chop chop, (everybody dies) 
Swing swing swing, chop chop chop, 
Everybody, everybody, everybody run, 
Murdering, murdering, murdering fun, (everybody dies) 
Sw-ii-ing , chop chop chop, (everybody dies) 
Swiiiiii-ing, chop chop chop, 
Everybody, everybody, everybody run,

Swing-a-ling ling , chop chop chop, (everybody dies) 
Swi-ii-ing, chop chop chop, 
Everybody, everybody, everybody run, 
Murdering, murdering, murdering fun, (everybody dies)
