Yo, yo

[D'Angelo]
I see you dancing right now
I don't need to tell you that you know how
Baby you do, oh
I say you belong
And if you dream, you'd be free
I can take you there
Just follow me
Baby I won't, I won't steer you wrong
And it seems like to me
You want someone to treat you like their queen
Babe I do
So what'cha want?
Smack your ass, pull your hair
And I even kiss you way down there
You know I will
Think I won't?

[D'Angelo]
That's the way we do it
Left and right
Keep it moving
Up and down
How we do it babe

Up and down
Love it went you do it

Yo D how we do it
[Redman]
Hey yo D how we do it

Hey yo how we do it
All day how we do it

[D'Angelo]
Yeah
I hear you calling my world
Make you feel like a pearl
I'll rub your back and fulfill your needs, yeah
So I would suggest you get undressed
Fingertips touching and you'll come back
As I want
Why don't you give it to me?
I will have you believe
There's no reason for you to leave
Stay right here (stay right here)
In my arms (in my arms)
Bring you fears stay secure
Here with me you can be sure
There's no faking you turn me on

[Method Man]
Yo D how we do it
Funk Doc how we do it
[Redman]
Yo Stallion
[Method Man]
This is how we do it


[D'Angelo]
Why don't you know?
The sexy little things you do
(The sexy little things you do)
Oh, oh why don't you know?
The sexy little things you do, ooh

[Redman]
Yo, yo
My flows remarkable
Doc walk like Kane from Kung Fu round the globe
Throw obstacles I'll hurdle them
Herb and whack MC's, drum racks
To the rims to the caps
Yo Meth, Tical, and D
I'm ASAP, I'm crack a don chicken hunting at KFC
In '83 I was that scrub TLC talking bout
Now I rock the house
Chalk em out

[Method Man]
Yeah no doubt who gots the biggest ass in the house
Young miss fillet-a-fish
Salt water trout, pretty young thing
Got a tongue ring and dirty mouth
And she whispering them sweet nothings
I hear it out
Baby you got me like Joni had Cha Chi
Until she got high and went and fucked Potsi
Lady Godiva
&gt;From day one a dick rider
Liar, liar set your pussy on fire

[Redman](Method Man)
Yo Doc be off the wall
We keep a Marly cheap
Pulling a Harley deep with a jar of grease
Come 1-5-1, straight endo, the spot
I fuck brown sugar behind the fiber glass window
Its Doc not guns don't sling weight
The only thing I sling is condoms for spring break
(Fuck em) How we do it?
(Leave em) How we do it?
(Get the money) The pussy
(The weed) Now do it

[Method Man](Redman)
Now take your coat off and stay a while
Now honey child if you're gon' be acting funny style
Then I don't need ya
It's Saturday, this night fever
Shit is popping, Acheeva my mouth cotton
Tis the season for draws dropping
And heavy breathing
You ain't skeezin' you dick teasin'
I'm leavin'
Acting rotten, I got no time for games
I'm no joke
Drop that ass when I'm finished
And watch it smoke
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)</pre>
