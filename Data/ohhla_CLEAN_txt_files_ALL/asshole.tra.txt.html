[Trae]
I'm a asshole nigga, and I'm running the pack
I advise that you clear the set, cause I'm about to attack
It's been a lot of niggaz hating, on the shit that I'm bringing
But fuck what you talk, Guerilla niggaz perfect with aiming
I'm bout to lean on the market, trying to leave me for dead
Cause all that hopping fire with Trae, will get your bitch ass bled
So everyday it be the same, it's just me and my dogs
Back then I couldn't focus, I was blinded by the fog
And Donnie I ain't forgot you, ain't a damn thang changed
It's SK to the death, I'm still repping the game
So I'ma ride for the team, when I fuck up the game
And now the whole Spring Branch, fin to respect the name
And it hurt, when the judge said 1 to the 5
If they ever let you free, I hope I'll still be alive
Why these bitch ass niggaz, wanna see me a goner
See I'ma swing from the heart, and slip they ass in a coma
They don't want it how I'ma give it, I mean what I say
And I say what I mean, they bout to see me strapped with a beam
And they don't wanna get it gangsta, we can go with the fists
And as soon as they drop the gun, I bet I get in they shit
I gotta tell it like it is, and I ain't holding back a thang
So if they ever hear the name, then bitch I guess I'll be to blame
Only thing I got to claim, is my balls and my word
Disrespect, and watch how niggaz run your head to the curb
I'm a Mobster, looking for the worst of thangs
Retaliation is a must, for all my niggaz in pain
Z-Ro, I tried to chill but they got me wired up
And all these niggaz leaching your name, done got me fired up
These niggaz ain't real, I swear to God that they hoes
Let's see how much they got to say, with a 4-4 to they nose
I'm bout to bring it to the face, when they fuck with the Maab
It's like we been against the world, since we left out the yard
And I don't trust, nan nigga Ro
The only reason they around, cause they know we gon blow
But everything will be revealed, in a matter of time
I'm constantly on a mission, until I'm laying em down
I only ask for the Lord, to forgive me for my sins
But everyday is the same thing, all over again
Shit done built up in my chest, so now I gotta let it free
Everybody and they mama, want me D-E-A-D
That's why my attitude done got me, with another reputation
But fuck jail, and tell the judge suck my dick fuck probation
I'm a soldier, and only for the streets I ride
You bitches got my brother every hour, with 3-65
Everything is coming soon, so get ready for the war
We gon come for the war, and I ain't leaving with a scar
Only way that I'ma leave, is if I'm in a pine box
And you gon know that it be real, when you hear the nine shots
Dear mama, I feel like your son is going for the edge
They should of never let me wake up, on the wrong side of the bed
And I got no understanding, cause this world is a trip
And I don't wanna be a victim, so I'm loading a clip
Ready to mash like a lunatic, with my mug on
And ain't no need for me to rest, cause I'm in a slug zone
It ain't no fairy tale my nigga, so don't try to be cool
You don't wanna get involved, with that A.B.N. dude</pre>
