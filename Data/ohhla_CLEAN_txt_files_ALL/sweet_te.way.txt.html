Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Duty calls, the forest right outside, right outside
Ain't no love, but I can't find my life
Temptation to see all that we find
I don't mind cause the party never ends, in the after life

It's plenty bread out there, I wan a slice
In the stool all night, play with white boys like
Plike, part my cartney and mick jack
Me and mick jerz bring the right beats, right words
Together I put the c in the work clever
All my niggas scripping appreciate that, no death
I'm a muslim not a banger, but if you want danger
I can definetly situate that, asap
I'm just tryina come up, I was tryina lay back
But drug money ran out and niggas try to run up
But we had one up, left them niggad done up
They speech, blood money and lawyer fees, had to pay that
Wish I would have knew that, probably would have throw back
Chuf guy's the new raps, what they do that
On top of that, niggas with tight slacks is the new rap
I'm bout to grab a plane ticket to Africa and move back, yeah

[Chorus]
Duty calls, the forest right outside, right outside
Ain't no love, but I can't find my life
Temptation to see all that we find
I don't mind cause the party never ends, in the after life

I've been a jurist since the public school era
Biggy smalls era and wa era
Now I'm bringing chairer to the new era
And some fresh phone, deposit snap back new era
And I was confused now I see it clearer
Just as clear as when I'm seeing my son I'm seeing the mirror
Married to the streets, that's the ring bearer
I had a few bitches before I was sit the pharos
And I cheat on her every time I see Paris
See switzerland and bvlgari, yeah
My old head told me fuck her don't marry her
Cause if you marry her you gonn have to carry her
And them young niggas that wanna, gonn try to bury her
It's the same dude that told me protect my area
I'm stubborn won't let them mess my marriage up
She about to pull the carriage up

[Chorus]
Duty calls, the forest right outside, right outside
Ain't no love, but I can't find my life
Temptation to see all that we find
I don't mind cause the party never ends, in the after life</pre>
