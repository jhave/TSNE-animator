(Silkk talking)
Ok P, I think they done fucked up now, right?
We have to bring the headbusters down
From that 504, ya'll know wha w bout, ya heard me?

chorus [Krazy] 1X
These bitch niggas can't fuck wit' us
We bust
I guess I gotta show you niggas you could be touched.
Me and my souljas, we be bout, 50 deep
The life that we livin' we can't slip or sleep

[Halloway]
I'm from that 405 backwards
WhereI fell in these tractors
Where niggas ride around wit' 20's spinnin' on adaptors.
I'm from the Terrordome
Where niggas sport hair and bone
And there's one major label in this city, and each is own.
No love for hos
Cuz they'll leave you wit' your shit exposed
Set you up
And get cut
And act like they don't know fuck
I'm from that dirty
Where niggas will kill behind that birdie
We use words like say brah and bitch you heard me.

[G-Spade]
War and collide
Fuck wit' us and fo'  sho die
HIt yo' block from both sides
GC's sick and tired
These niggas don't play
Thinkin' it's a fuckin' game
Bitch hide you rear, but too, we struck to your fuckin' brain.
Better ask them niggas do they really want war
They'll tell you ah, nope, not wit' Spade dawg
Shit's real
Get your cap peeled
Feel your blood spill
Keep this snub, no steel
Cuz these thugs will kill

[Valario]
It's war wit' this six slugs
Known to sell drugs
Down south, thugged out, never gave a fuck
Everybody in this muthafucka down to bust
504, nothin' but murderas among us
Ghetto Commission rippin' them niggas up alone the choppers.
TSO know that the ghetto niggas street stoppers.
504, the Westbanks comin' real
504, them other niggas know the deal

chorus 2X

[Silkk the Shocker]
 Nigga can't be fucked wit', dawg, nigga, no way.
We make niggas go to the FEDz, so they can relocate.
While ya'll do it for a couple of hours, we do it for the whole day.
If I gotta do somethin', shit, you know I gots ta hold weight.
War, we about that nigga
Fuck wit' my clique, I doubt that nigga
Leave the keys in the car, hop up out that nigga
Cuz we about the figgas
Still about the triggas
To myself, type of nigga that'llstay in the cut
Lil' quiet ass niggas, really don't say much
Hatas, confrence calls tomorrow, tryin' to make up.
No pistols play slim nigga, hardly lift no weights up.
Project nigga, sip Henny in a cup
19 on the Sedan, come through 20's on the truck.
Thugged out
NIgga, I love this clout
Put it down for my niggas, plus I love the South
See these niggas that I roll wit', don't gotta second guess that.
They'll put it there, where your chest at
Tank around my neck, ya'll better respect that
I don't fight, if you got hands (guns fire) you'll catch that.

chorus 2X

(Krazy talking)
Now
Fuck it
Murder your muthafuckin' ass nigga
Ghetto Commission nigga
And that nigga Silkk
Haha, and Krazy
I'm just thuggin' 
It's all love, babay
This No Limit shit deep nigga
You niggas can't swim 
Don't get in the muthafuckin' water
Cuz you'll get a bomb bitch
We don't give a fuck
It's ain't no love
Nothin' but thugs
