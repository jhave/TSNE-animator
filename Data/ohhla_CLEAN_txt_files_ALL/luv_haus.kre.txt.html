Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Too early, it's morning
Some reason it's blinding
Just think that we're rolling
How high am I going?
Can you recognize, familiarize?
Tell me how you picture us polarize

Hey hey hey ah ah ahh
Hey hey hey ah ah ahh

One love cause I'm hooked on the feel
Back then I used to have it for sale
Reach out and put your hands on the ground
I'm in the sky but I feel like I'm down
You take the time, you make me lose it all
You build me up and then you let me fall
You take the time, you make me lose control
You had me high and then you take it all

Hello barber
I'm sitting on the moon now
You take care of my problems
You take care of my broken heart

Hey hey hey ah ah ahh
Let's end before we start
Hey hey hey ah ah ahh
Let's end before we start

One love cause I'm hooked on the feel
Back then I used to have it for sale
Reach out and put your hands on the ground
I'm in the sky but I feel like I'm down
You take the time, you make me lose it all
You build me up and then you let me fall
You take the time, you make me lose control
You had me high and then you take it all

Now, I change my mood when I see the moon
Now, I change my mood when I see the moon

One love cause I'm hooked on the feel
Back then I used to have it for sale
Reach out and put your hands on the ground
I'm in the sky but I feel like I'm down
You take the time, you make me lose it all
You build me up and then you let me fall
You take the time, you make me lose control
You had me high and then you take it all

Now, I changed my mood when I seen the moon
Now, I changed my mood when I seen the moon</pre>
