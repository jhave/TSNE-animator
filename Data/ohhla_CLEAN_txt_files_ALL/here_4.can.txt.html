Girl! Look over there...is that Canibus?

[Female #2]
I Don't Know

[Female #1]
It looks like him

[Female #2]
I think it is

[Bouncer]
Is your name on the list?
Who you here to see?

[Canibus]
I don't think I'm on the list
I'm just here for free

[Bouncer]
You got a video out?
You got a platinum LP?

[Canibus]
Yo why does that matter?
I just came for free

[Bouncer]
Alright Bis
Let him through

[Female #1]
Where's he been?

[Canibus]
Damn girl look at you now, huhh
On T.V.
With that pretty smile, huhh
Truth is I miss you and I wanna tell ya
But I ain't got no numbers, email, or nothing
You know I seen you at the Bad Boy for life shoot
You was wearing a tight light blue Nike suit
I remember when I connected eyes with you
You winked at me, I thought that was really nice of you
I remember once staying up all night with you
Writing with you, talking bout life with you, it was exciting too
I'm assuming you did the same cause you cared
Girl, don't you remember all the laughter we shared
We used to talk about why Pras failed so bad
And why the hell Wyclef's breath smells so bad
Okay, I know I don't need to tell em all that
But we was kinda feelin each other, you can't deny that
We worked on records together, you murdered them tracks
I think it was sexy how you said the verses like that
You said, "Free be the one rockin shyt, special operative, specialize any
weapon diagnostic"
Just thinkin about it got me souped up
I wanna hug you in your birthday suit, what
Damn, this record is getting out of hand
I'm crazy, you probably already got a man
In that case I hope you hear this song
Sincerely yours, see you at 106 &amp; Park</pre>
