[Sean Price]
I'm such a failure, hehe, ha hah
P!! First of all I'd like to say - nothin really
This beat is just so cool, you know you just wanna relax and
say some old cool shit (word) but that's not me (nah)
P!! Let's go

Aiyyo, supersonic chronic got my mind ease
But, never think that the God won't squeeze
Sean is the man, and I'm doin all that I can
When I rhyme, feel like the world's in the palm of my hand
All I is is all I am
And, all you is, who gives a damn?
It's like, wop-babalu-bop-doo-wop-bam-boom
The glock, got a few shots, you popped, drop - oooh
I'm buck with the words, I went to school
When I pop you with the tool, catch a slug from a nerd
That's my word to my mother
You act stupid duke I'm hurtin your mother like "WHAT BITCH~!"
Commence to smackin her face like a pimp
Then put the old bitch back in her place
The beat is smooth, the rap is hard
Just the way I like it bless the mic of the God
It's violent

[whispered] It's violent, it's violent, it's violent... {*3X*}
Bless the mic of the God, it's violent
[whispered] It's violent, it's violent, it's violent... {*2X*}

Yeah... aiyyo
Timberland boots I got stomp out your grill
Sean Price, the nicest nigga in Brownsville
Word bond, y'all niggaz can't rap worth a damn
The nine burst blam and earthslam your fam
Word to mother, my shit raw dog like fuck rubbers
Motherfuck literally, I fuck mothers
2006 I got a new bag of tricks
Boot Camp, J. League, new improved rappin shit
I'm a certified, fortified, forty-five holder
Been like that way before "Eshkoshkah"
We the best in the in-dus-try
We the worst when we in-the-streets
Got a verse nigga where's the beef?
Burger rappers screamin "Where's the beef"
You're soft, get lost, 'fore you scream where's your teeth
The beat is smooth, the rap is hard
Just the way I like it bless the mic of the God
It's violent

[whispered] It's violent, it's violent, it's violent... {*2X*}
Bless the mic of the God, it's violent
[whispered] It's violent, it's violent, it's violent... {*2X*}

P! Aiyyo

[repeat 2X]
This goes out to my Brownsville crew
Put your guns up in the air, don't kill me!
Buck 'em all day, buck 'em all night
We let off fo'-fo's

P!!

[whispered] It's violent, it's violent, it's violent... {*3X to fade*}</pre>
