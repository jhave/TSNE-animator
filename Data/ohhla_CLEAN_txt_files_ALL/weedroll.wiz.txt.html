Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's Young Khalifa man Taylor Gang or die (ahyeah)

Shes my weed roller
And when I'm with her guarantee I'm never sober (sober)
she know exactly what I need she keep them swishers (swishers)
the way she rolling up that weed I gotta keep her (keep her)
I gotta keep her

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
That's good weed and she knows so she don't fuck up my swisher
she roll that thing that hit hard like a kicker
I hit the bed and then I get to twist her (twist her)
like my swisher (swisher)
and she my weed roller (roller)
a 50 box she rolled 'em I was like damn (damn)
she lit the first one up like you know who I am
my weed roller she only good for three blunts then it's over

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Shes my weed roller
And when I'm with her guarantee I'm never sober (sober)
she know exactly what I need she keep them swishers (swishers)
the way she rolling up that weed I gotta keep her (keep her)
I gotta keep her

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
She know I need that weed as soon I come home
off the road to make it easy on me she got one already rolled
a nice long swisher (swisher)
and shes a good twister (twister)
yeah I got one that will roll my weed for me
(and she don't smoke so that's more weed for me)
No I can't front this shawty got me impressed (yes)
make a cigar look like a cigarette

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Shes my weed roller
And when I'm with her guarantee I'm never sober (sober)
she know exactly what I need she keep them swishers (swishers)
the way she rolling up that weed I gotta keep her (keep her)
I gotta keep her</pre>
