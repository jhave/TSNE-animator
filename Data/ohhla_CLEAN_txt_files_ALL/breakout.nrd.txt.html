[Verse - Pharrell Williams]
It just happened, so what
But they're all laughing, wassup
Why the tears? have no fear
We are here for you
But I know how you feel
I know how you feel when no one cares

[Pre-Chorus - Pharrell &amp; (Shae)]
If you feel just like I feel (push people)
Everythings plastic, nothings real (push people)
Fuck your lover face, not steal (push people)
We're just dancing, no big deal (push people)
Hey just let the bullshit pass (push people)
Or we'll skateboard your ass (push people)
Got more bombs, more wheels (push people)
We're just dancing, no big deal (push people)

[Chorus - Pharrell &amp; (Shae)]
Breakout (push people) breakout
Breakout (push people) breakout
Breakout (push people) breakout
Breakout (push people) breakout
Breakout (push people) breakout
Breakout (push people) breakout
(Push people) break awayyyyy (push people)

[Verse - Pharrell Williams]
All you can be is just you
Cause you're real, not the plastic type
But reality sets in this dark and this plastic life
Why the tears? we're all here for you
But I know how you feel
I know how you feel and I do care

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Pharrell]
Hey (shit happens) hey (just blow it off) (WHOOOOO!!!!)
Man, well don't it make ya feel GREEAAATTTT yeah, GREEAAATTTT yeah
(WHOOOOO!!!!) Hey! (shit happens) uh huh (just blow it off) (WHOOOOO!!!!)
Yeah, well don't it make ya feel GREEAAATTTT yeah, GREEAAATTTT yeah
(WHOOOOO!!!!) .. just as long as we got the same thing in our veins
You and I, we are both the same
I'll bail you out, show you what you seek
One love, N.E.R.D, peace</pre>
