Yo Boss, hey turn them headphones up for me my nigga
Trae the Truth, Young Chill told myself I wasn't gon get back in that zone mayn
It's like this track you did, keep calling for it though
I feel it's one of these motherfuckers, make this song cry
Straight up shit never fail mayn, this motherfucker got me in a zone
It's a lot of you motherfuckers, that did a nigga bad
You got me fucked up this time

[Trae]
No matter what happens, I promise I keep it real and never be fly
Something like Jigga, cause I gotta make this song cry
Never no emotion but I feel I need to share my pain, come on stand in the rain with a nigga
See how I feel on an everyday basis, when hard life took aim at a nigga
I never thought that I'd ever see the day, the people I got love for turned me away
But it is what it is, the only one left to trust is Trae
I got a child on the way, and it seem to me I ain't gon see it
My baby mama wanna see it dead, cause she say she don't need it
And I be wrong, to play an eye for an eye
But see her devilish ways, can stay and see me rolling on by
Hateful bitch, loyalty is what I know and I don't know too many with it
Homies left to click to kick it, with niggaz in higher digits
And I ain't mad, I was hurt for a sec
But I learned, that I gotta be strong and hold it down for the rest of my set
Plus my baby Neeko, getting older now
You and Jared relax, cause I got you on my shoulder now daddy on his way up
Nobody finna bring me back down, it's war and I won't back down
The weight on my shoulders prolly weigh too much, but I won't slack down
I click and I drop the Lac down, and mob as I'm thinking
I'm unable to cry, so it make it hard when I'm thinking
No way to thin out, but I thank the Lord for leaving me my family
A.B.N. and M.C.G., the only one living to handle me
My nigga Dougie free, to see me make it through them gates
When I get my chance, I'ma come back and guide you to the plate
It ain't never too late, we just gon hope that we can get to see it
And I'd give my last breath, and my last smile to get to see it
Danny Boo, I know that you lost your mama and your daddy gone
But know I'm here to be your guard until Dinkie come home
I've been feeling it lately, I'm getting shorter than life
These niggaz try to stop my day, but I came through the night
And if I gotta go, just know someone gon keep me living
And this is all that I'm giving, ain't nothing else I'm feeling</pre>
