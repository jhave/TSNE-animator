Ya...Ladies I'm Back
Got What You Need...Got You Ready
I Want You To Fluff My Pillow For Me

I'm out wandering, watching while you're looking bored
Rappable powers, half my life is on record
Where the record shopper for anal swap meet cats
Or pulling off the rigid panties from your young auntie
Entrepeneur maneuver, rappers, Inspector Gadget
Pager digits for slim, honies who got the money
Gang flipping magician, you call me David Blaine
Sex first is worth my girl, peep that yellow skirt
Deranged sexual launch, short of a comic
Cookies and milk, honey's pussy felt like warm silk
I bought the coffee maker, listen to Janet Jackson
Food in Tampa, the beach, was it really happening
Sweet G went to Vegas to check the burger joint
Emergency, beautiful sandwich with the handle shit
Calculator work, I got a safe budget
Soft sofa, leather floor, fucking read the warrant
Human afternoon, A/C in the Caravan
The moral street passes shoppers, second hand meet
Partial people, drug induced, reproduced killers
I sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla

"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"

Partial delivery, DJ with that care package
Actual racket makes attacks, break her backbreaker
Jawbreaker, assign all keys, super sweet tooth
Your lady blew her time with me in the vocal booth
Empty the ATM, switch account to city bank
Bank of Montreal, BLT with pickles, the waitress giggle
The '86, my deal the, was sold to get
Nowadays, I save my memories, I don't forget
I have fun as my alias, my stacks grow
Dark slacks, amtrack, I just relax bro
Stress is for the seagulls, I peep some more finesse
Making lasagna, so people can't afford a dress
My address, attached to a mellow smooth location
When it's time for vacation, ain't no Greyhound Station
I don't like to fly, but hey I do it all the time
Hit on the stewardess, is that a Valour dress

"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"

Paper enhancer, the quiet man with all the answers
My style is dreamscape, coffee with the cream cake
Casual observer, the underground rapper server
I'm not the hip-hop authority, who's a lead murder suspect
I'm slashing their careers on the torso
Didn't think it was, my nautica is hot also
Middle of the day, send me up some mellow Tony
I got melon and rappers lack if they pistol packing
That's if they forget to call, but won't it happen slowly
She'll come back, she cut off, strut off, end of story
Triple my D-head, welcome to my seargeant's honey
More of some sweet G, from here to Boston dummy
Mammal is durable, expression of executiveness
Buy some land, eat a porno tape and dry my hand
Lottery luck, Lauterdale sipping Gerry Hill
Canada Dry, amateur born looking in the hill
Antoinette suck my sweat plus my clarinet
I go to K-Mart, fuck around and hit the strip
Most exciting got you fingernail biting
For real, I sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla

"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"</pre>
