[Verse 1 - Skyzoo]
Survival of the fittest, posted where it's probable for pitchin
And suicide doors is the object of the mission
You either outdoors like "I got it, come and get it"
Or stirrin upstairs with a stop watch in the kitchen
Followin the minute hand
Like "Lord help us", good pot, bag full of bottles and a ceiling fan
Good block, ain't nobody similar at all for a minute
So should of get the click until it's gone if you with it
Get it from when it sizzle to it yawn in a scrimmage
Coffee cup early in the morn' with the business
So fuck if you slow, money never waits
And dreams do got wings, they could levitate
Sleep now and you starve later (starve later)
But two seaters turn divas into soft layups (get it?)
Same song, different DJ
It's downloaded if you need it on a replay

[Chorus - Skyzoo] - 2X
Call it the necessary evils
I ain't tryin to get by, I'm tryin to speed through
Nah I ain't tryin to get by, I'm tryin to speed through
We tell this corner goodbye as soon as we through
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)

[Verse 2 - Skyzoo]
Fast cars, fast broads
Fast money, it really ain't that hard
But every dollar you make comes with a set of eyes
And a set of loose lips if ever you ever hide
And everything that's should is residin that far
And everything that good is right in your backyard
And everything that kills is typin you back hard
And everything that will depends on the backboard (woo)
But we "Trill", somethin like Ross is (Ross is)
Short sleeves in the winter for the flossin (flossin)
Twenty degrees on the wrist, no defrostin
Cost two whole weekends, you gon' see this
And you the next contestant
Your life could go from Mickie D's to Benny Hannas, Tameka to Rihanna
Huh, same song, different DJ
It's downloaded if you need it on a replay

[Chorus] - 2X

[Break - Skyzoo]
Get it once (get it once), get it twice (get it twice)
Get it two more times in the same night (same night)
Get it once (get it once), get it twice (get it twice)
That money buildin and you feelin kind of nice

Get it once (get it once), get it twice (get it twice)
Get it two more times in the same night (same night)
Get it once (get it once), get it twice (get it twice)
But you blinked and now you sprintin with blue and whites

[Chorus] - 4X

[Break - Skyzoo] - repeated until fade
Get it once, get it twice
Get it two more times in the same night</pre>
