Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Am I changing right before your eyes?
Becoming someone you don't recognize
As if I was disguised, I'm on that shit as if I was the Fly
I'm touchin' skies, no puffin' lie
Man these songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Gon' finally give a nigga leg room and a whip
From a Civic to a Chevy must've died and went to heaven
Like a passenger on 9/11 - please go find a reverend
You see I promise that I'd never change
But that was way before I made the dough and met the game
Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow
And even white women want a nigga - Othello
I'm ballin' with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmello
Now the crib got much room -Portobello
She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow
I sit yo ass down like you was playin' a cello
See, you niggaz hated and I levitated further
Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder
So if it comes down, may the best man win
No sweat like a head band

[Chorus]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me

[Verse 2]
I'm a kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm givin' out life sentences
Like keep grindin' boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I pay dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggaz feel me
Light-skinned so the house niggaz feel me
She catch me creepin' out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth it what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke, you would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings 'cause now all the chicks feelin' him
You gotta adapt though never goin' back

[Chorus]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me

I can't keep running away
I can't keep running away
I swear I'm coming back today
But if I'm wrong
And I ain't got what it takes
Then all dem people that was counting on me
Boy won't you climb down the mountain for me</pre>
