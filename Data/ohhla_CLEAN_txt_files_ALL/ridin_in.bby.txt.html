Baby D:
Dip in a plane 
Naw looking smooth in a chopper boy
In a Chevy baby
I'm gettin richa boy
Let me rub ya lady
What have you been doing?
Have you been freakin lately?
No stuntin or frontin 
Because you I want it 
So back it up
Cuz you know i'm on it
You drive me crazy
Not lettin lately
Big bout it Benzes
Ballin wit my friends
We pulled up to da club
Wit a Chevy on dubs
Come give me a hug baby
Ya see me on some dubs
Swervin crazy
I know you wanna cut me up baby
But first of all we gotta hit da club baby

(Chorus)
Ya see me ridin in a Chevy baby
Ya see me on some dubs
Swervin crazy
I know you wanna cut me up
Baby
But first of all 
We gotta hit da club
Baby

Sammy Sam:
I see in yo eyes you wants to lay me
But baby you gots to pay me 
You see cleanin doolie
But later we can get crazy
We can hit da club or somethin
Get drunk or somethin
End up at the tail
Where we cuttin or somethin
Ain't no cares 
Bout this playa
They want the fame or somethin
Association wit a youngsta
that love havin fun
Aye it's Mr.Freddy Major Fred from G.A slum
Enjoy swervin
And spittin all that game
to those that wanna hear em
Hit the club and watch me in that thang
Straight from the real

(Chorus)

Lil C:
I'm ridin in a Chevy been da hit
Atlanta live
I'm doin da bills 
Speedin down 2-85
Swervin bouncin on some dubs
Watching out for deez hattas
We got on Iceberg
Carty A's
And some gators
Navigator,Yukon
Suburban,Tahoes
Tight clothes
We swervin
In a Chevy baby
Flip flop changing colors
For da club 
Know that
Next weekend
Wegone be back
Doin it again
And again
In a big bout it Benz

(Chorus 3x)
Ohhh-ohhhh(fading out)</pre>
