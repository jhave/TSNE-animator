Yeah
Bring in the drums
PackFM!
I'm on the list, bitch!
Bring in the drums!
This is for my muthafuckas up in VIP... who got all their shit free...
Listen up..

[Verse 1]
I'ma tell you all somethin very simple and plain
I ain't a pimp, I don't walk wit' a limp and a cane
I ain't a hustla makin dollars from a dime and a nick
I ain't a balla, but my jersey always matches my kicks
"When Pack's in the mix..." I impress chicks
Name on my necklace, skip the line, get in free
And I ain't on the guest list
VIP status, people showin' me love
Shit's free, I ain't spendin' 50 cent in the club
Now if it ain't for free, then it ain't for me
These ladies came for me and I aim to please
And every - day of the week see me doin' my thing
She trynna move like a freak, come and prove it to me...

[Hook]
Somebody's havin a party and I don't know who, but I'll ask somebody
And it's Qn5 all up in this bitch, and if I ain't on the list, I ain't
fuckin wit this

[Verse 2]
Last call at the bar, everybody outside
Got the traffic on stall cuz you double parked the ride
Hurtin' somebody's pride wit the size of your rims
I ain't licensed to drive but I got the nice Timbs
I don't rock it like him tho, shit be exclusive
Everytime I walk out the door it's some new shit
Stay dipped in head to toe, courtesy of Ecko
"Man, how he get in? I thought they had a dress code?"
I get treated special, I laugh at you clowns
I pass through wit a pound while they pattin you down
And no, I don't drink liquor, but I got these drink tickets
And my whole crew's here, let's have a few rounds...

[Hook]
Somebody's havin a party and I don't know who, but I'll ask somebody
And it's E-Famm, all up in this bitch, and if I ain't on the list, I ain't
fuckin' wit this

[Bridge]
Somebody's havin' a party and I don't know who, but I'll ask somebody
And it's .... all up in this bitch, and if I ain't on the list, I ain't
fuckin' wit this..

Now everybody in the spot, you wanna get in for free say "I ain't payin"
I AIN'T PAYIN'
Everybody in the spot who love VIP say "I ain't payin'"
I AIN'T PAYIN'

[Verse 3]
Now I ain't playin', listen up, I ain't payin'
And if the DJ's wack, then I ain't stayin'
Fuck what the list say, I'ma find my way in
You know the kid's in free like the Holiday Inn
Half the time I lie sayin' I'm performin'
And it works cuz the fans on line start swarmin' (oh my God!)
This bouncer keep grillin' me, like he ain't really feelin' me
You take this too serious you beefed up doorman
It's just a party, why I gotta know somebody?
I'm prolly older than you, let me see some ID
You ain't a cop and this ain't a crime
There's more people on line than there is inside
So I really don't see what the fuss is about
When they hear that I'm here then they all rushin' out
Instead of cussin' you out, we gon set it right here
Fuck ya list, I don't care, party over - We out!

[Hook]
Somebody's havin a party, and I don't know who, but I'll ask somebody
And it's The Plague, all up in this bitch, and if I ain't on the list, I
ain't fuckin' wit this
Somebody's havin a party, and I don't know who, but I'll ask somebody
And it's PackFM, all up in this bitch, and if I ain't on the list, I ain't
fuckin' wit this

It's PackFM, and I ain't payin'. I'm on the list. Nah, nah nah nah.. it
should say PackFM. I'm wit Mike. Go get Mike! Dog, go get Mike, for real! I
should be on the list. It ain't my fault. C'mon dog - stop fuckin' wit me
I'm on the list....</pre>
