Light it up! Yeah
Put it in the air (high lights, high lights)
(high lights, high lights)

[Aceyalone]
Bubble kush, cat piss, purple rain
Hash plant, thai stick, white {?} the train
Indo, outdo', to the brain
Orange brown redhead, green, the potent strains
Bongs, blunts, and zig-zags
Bubblers, bowls, blowin out of big bags
Twist up, roll up, pack up, hit that
Scent so strong in the air, where you get that?
Afghan, Pakistan, lamb's bread, skunk
Acapulco Goldy, hydro funk
Blueberry, chronic, chocolate chunk
Northern lights, buddha bless, cannabis cup
And that's what's up

(high lights, high lights)
(high lights, high lights)

[Aceyalone]
The legislation wants regulation
Want to interfere with my cultivation
My personal usage for meditation
And medication to help the patients
Cancer, asthma, emphysema
Back pains, migraines, grass is greener
Glaucoma, arthritis, epileptic seizures
Medicine man make me a believer
Cheech &amp; Chong, "Reefer Madness"
"Half Baked," _How High_ heal the masses
Light that, puff that, dump the ashes
Take 2, take 3, take 4 and pass it

(high lights, high lights)
(high lights, high lights)

[Aceyalone]
Super silver, Hawaiian haze
Sativa, indica, Solomon's grave
Genesis, chapter one verse twelve ways
Marijuana, hashish, everybody blaze
Fuels and fibers, energy saved
When the natives met the travelers, guess what they gave
All praise due to the seeds they raised
And the people all over the world that smoke J's
Kings and queens, musicians, actors
Everyday, working class, stoners, slackers
Low key blazers and green bowl packers
If Mary Jane is in the house then I'm gon' mack her

(high lights, high lights)
This is dedicated to everybody in the world that smoke weed
Legalize it
(high lights, high lights)
Eat it, use it for fibers, Aceyalone</pre>
