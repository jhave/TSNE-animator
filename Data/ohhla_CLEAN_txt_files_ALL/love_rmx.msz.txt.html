[Missez]
Boy you make me want to sing you a love song

[repeat a couple of times during the song]
"Blame it on the bass y'all, Trill on the bass y'all"

[Paul Wall overlaps as Missez harmonize]
Swishahouse...fo' real..
Paul Wall...Missez...

[Missez - Verse One]
Step into the club the, place be-ing so loud 
Boy I see you peep-in, me through the smoke cloud 
Gotta play it off, I gotta keep my cool, I - 
Gotta know your name because I'm feel-in you 
So I walk up to you slow, said,
"Baby would you like to get to know me?" 
Then you put you hands up on my body, baby don't let go 
Anything you want boy you can have, I'm yours 

[Chorus 2X] 
Uh, ahhhh, come on baby give it to me 
Just like that, boy you know exactly 
what I need from you, yeah you really turn me on 
Boy you make me wanna sing you a love song

[Verse Two] 
Temperature's a-rising, you got me hoping 
that your love is hypnotizing, to the next level boy 
with you is where I wanna go, but if I'm movin too FAST 
Baby just let me know...let me know.. (just let me know...) 
There something 'bout the way you move that makes me wonder 
how you work it 'cause my sheets I want you under 
Don't STOP 'cause I LIKE what you DOIN' babe 
Keep it goin right there, you make me wanna say.. 

[Chorus 2X]

[Paul Wall]
Aye - excuse me misses, I see you peepin me; what it do? 
Gone and give me a minute or two, and you gon' be wantin' to call me boo 
Paul Wall baby that's my name; in the bed I'm off the chain 
I'm comin at you rough and untamed
Can you keep up, can you hang? 
Trust me girl you won't complain, the bed springs gone stay squeakin 
Yo insides gon' stay creamin, 'cause all night I'm gon' stay freakin 
All night it's gon' go down, but hold on baby, I don't go down 
I keep yo head spinnin around and have you makin all kinda sounds 
I have you moanin, have you squealin, baby ya ain't never had this feelin 
You can call me the Love Doctor 'cause I'm gon' give you that Sexual Healin 
I'm known for back breakin, I'd slip you up outcha weave 
and when I'm finished, that next mornin' 
Lil' mama ya ain't gon' wanna leave 
I tell the truth I don't deceive, I'm discrete I don't kiss and tell 
I put it on ya just like a spell, I do the do and I do it well 
No minuteman baby I go long, I go hard and I go strong 
Lay it on ya and I'm gon' have you wantin to sing me a love song 

[Chorus 2X]
