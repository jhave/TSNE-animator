Not another +I Miss My Homies+ song
I don't expect y'all to understand this
Cause y'all ain't never lost nobody
But imagine the closest person to you
See everybody feel it
But some of us
Feel it more than the rest
Just think about it
It only add 
More to the stress
I try to live my life day by day
And ignore the rest
It's so FUCKED UP
I can feel life
More than I feel death
Split second
And picture
The family's being torn
I gotta tell my little nephew
His dad wasn't around
To see him being born
When we get older
Playing with our kids
He just sittin' all alone
You know what his last birthday wish was
He wishes daddy come home
And while I'm at the funeral 
Contemplating sittin' in strap
He looked up to me
Gave me a hug and asked me
"Silkk, where my daddy at?"
Question I couldn't answer
Tell him a vacation
And somehow I wish
If I tell him this enough
Maybe one day 
He just might forget

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I guess I'll be seeing you
At the end of the road (end of the road, I'll see y'all there)
You know it ain't easy
Lettin' my homie go (end of the road, I'll see y'all there

Now I learn ??
I miss my homies so 
Even though
My homies gone 
Try to be strong on my dawgs
Used to hit me
But I'm home alone
All the memories I got of you
Shining like the sun
I used to invite you to my house
We used to fight
Who gone sleep in the top bunk
We used to
Throw rocks
To the cops then we'd run
We was so tight
We got caught
Both of us
They got just one
I remember dawg
We just like
Kick back and laughed
We grew up a little bit
Life made us choose a 
Different path
You chose to get a job
And I sold and dealed
You choose to go to school
And i chose the streets
I was the one that
Always lived fast
You used to want to live slowly
As I look in the casket
I though for sure
It was supposed to be me
Damn I lost my dawg
It's cold but its fair
And I contemplate to myself
Would it have been different
If I would've been there
I guess we'll never never
Never know
But I know one thing
Why's it always the good ones that got to go

[Chorus]

[Silkk]
It's never easy 
To let your loved ones go
Tomorrow now promise me
Tell me something that your loved ones know
A straight bullet in the neighborhood
Got a little girl
Holdin' her breath
In my arms I closed her eyes
She died while I was 
Holdin' her chest
I couldn't change
Even though the game was file
Through all the pain
Maintain
Still find ways to smile
And grandma(grandmama got sick)
And they fixed her to bed rest
The family was fightin' over who? left the money to
Picture this you won't even dead yet
And I'm sick of this east and west coast crap
This east and west coast trap
Lost two of the biggest mc's
To east and west coast rap
Rest in peace Biggie
Rest in peace Pac
And all them other soldiers
Make us see it??</pre>
