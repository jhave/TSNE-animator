  "Huh huh huh, now what was I to do?
   She's crying over me and she was feeling blue, I said" - Slick Rick (Repeat 4x)

I was walking down the street, just a minding my biz
I saw this young lady, the ultimate
She had a pair of jugs that was so fine
Then I took a look at that behind
36-24-36, I looked to her and I said "I need a fix"
I asked her the same blahzay, blahzay
Her name, where she live, and how much she weigh
I got her digits and gave her my 1-800 beeper number
You can leave a message under the name of Rhumba
I know you're bugging off, then I will be too
But every time she be walking, she turns the heads of the crew
Word is bond, I wouldn't be messing
With this girl if I knew she was an adolescent
To all the guys over 21, here's the news:
It's the hip-hop version of the Young Girl Bluez

  "Huh huh huh, now what was I to do?
   She's crying over me and she was feeling blue, I said" (Repeat 4x)

As the story goes on, I get a little deeper
I got a strange message on my 1-800 beeper
Call my looney, crazy, psychotic or dumb
But I got a good message from a girl named Rum
Come and get me from Mickey D's at 8
That's where I work after school, pick me up for a date
I was so excited that she called my pager
But never thought to ask if she was a teenager
She mentioned going to school, but I didn't think it was high
If you saw what I saw, then you know why
You wouldn't believe or even think of
A bird like that could be a dove
I picked her up in my Lexus coupe
Only God knows what I'm doing is an oof
Am I robbing a cradle? I'm very confused
I'm stuck in the middle of the Young Girl Bluez

  "Huh huh huh, now what was I to do?
   She's crying over me and she was feeling blue, I said" (Repeat 4x)

Now I was seeing her for about half a year
Everything was fine and dandy without shedding a tear
Age ain't nothing but a number, that's what Chi-Ali said
Okay then why don't you get that through the judge's head
Proceeding along, I must have to say
It was coming very close to her birthday
I asked "What do you want?" She said "A pair of earrings"
I never knew what an avalanche the future brings
Her birthday came and she gave a party
I arrive kind of late to the place to be
People was excited for seeing my face
If my mother ever knew I would be a disgrace
"How old are you now?" to Rhumba-reen
I was in shock when they screamed "Sixteen!"
I felt like falling apart when I heard the news
This is the never-ending saga of the Young Girl Bluez!

  "Huh huh huh, now what was I to do?
   She's crying over me and she was feeling blue, I said" (Repeat 4x)</pre>
