You know they say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
So vengeful, and mother Earth has been done wrong
And I think she sick, yo, she's pukin' up lava
Her nerves tremble along fault lines ready to drop
An entire city of filth that's been forced upon her
We built these towers of Babylon and feel remorse for nadda
The momma divorced the father, the children are dropping bottles
The rich get richer, poverty's hot under the collar
Takin' prayer out of schools and we tryin' to raise scholars
Creationism versus the theory of evolution
Air, water and mind, body and soul pollution
Kids steppin' on landmines, from wars we all losin'
We chasin' false idols and racin' from our bibles
The golden rule, the youth are becoming more suicidal
Who teachers 'em, you and I do, no wonder they wanna fight you
Raised by hipocrits you've been lied to

Graffiti the land with skyscrapers
Graffiti the sky with airplanes and satellites
Graffiti the mind of children with your manmade love
Graffiti the world, I saw the writing on the wall

We got ABC, NBC, MTV, TNT
The BBC, DVD, VHS, DSL
A&amp;E, XTC, MP3, SEC
THC, NRA, JOB, ADD
The fight for free speech, lack of responsibility
Seizin' positions of power, Internet pornography
Guns in the hold for fear that the next knock at the door
Could be death, the terrorists are in the White House and overseas
Racists, seperatists, vicious, malicious
Buddhists, the Hindus, the Muslims, the Christians
Could it be our biggest barrier is language
Or is oil that important that one would inflict anguish
So cars could deplete the ozone on highways
That stretch across the land where Indians once raised
Families, we're in denial, the world is afraid
And you say there's no more slaves

Graffiti the land with skyscrapers
Graffiti the sky with airplanes and satellites
Graffiti the mind of children with your manmade love
Graffiti the world, I saw the writing on the wall

We're addicted to planes, trains and automobiles
We're addicted to addiction, we dig living in fiction
For money, power, respect, the army gotta go kill
They under contract, so let the blood spill
It's sorta morbid, ain't it, the picture that I just painted
It's an epiphany I had, I realised just how tainted
I think it really is, while in New York I saw
A teenager being arrested for taggin' a fuckin' wall

Graffiti the land with skyscrapers
Graffiti the sky with airplanes and satellites
Graffiti the mind of children with your manmade love
Graffiti the world, I saw the writing on the wall

Graffiti the land with skyscrapers
Graffiti the sky with airplanes and satellites
Graffiti the mind of children with your manmade love
Graffiti the world, I saw the writing on the wall</pre>
