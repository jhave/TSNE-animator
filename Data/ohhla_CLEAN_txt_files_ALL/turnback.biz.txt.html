Song:   Turn Back the Hands of Time
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Verse One: Biz Markie]
This is a story about without a doubt
When I'm done, you will all scream and shout
They always say time is on our side
If it is, why is it a rough ride?
If I could save time or return to the past
I would bring back the good times, hate to last
Like when I was the size of Jay-Z
Back when Ra was still with Eric B
Remember when friends was friends, and LL had a Benz?
And cell phones and beepers was the new trends?
When Koch was the mayor and Reagan was the Pres?
We listened to what other enemies said

[Chorus: Lil' Kal]
I wish there was somethin made, or somethin designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin made, or somethin designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time

[Verse Two: Biz Markie]
I know y'all remember goin to Great Adventure
On Labor Day on the Beach in Virginia
The beginnin of the summer, at Jones Beach
When t-shirts, were ten dollars each
Didn't matter if you had a Lex, Beamer or a Benz
As long, as you had room for, all of the friends
Mr. Softee came through, or the Good Humor truck
When ice cream, was less than a buck
If it was up to me and I could turn back the clock
I'd bring Masterdon, Buffy, and Scott LaRock
So - please listen to my song and rhyme
If I can turn back the hands of time

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Verse Three: Biz Markie]
If I could turn time back in a rhyme
I'd bring back Bird, Magic, Jordan - in their prime
Remember the days OH, remember the days
When they had the high-top, fade craze
Want back Big Daddy Kane, Fresh Prince and Kid &amp; Play
"Ohhh, what a beautiful day!"
When parties was parties, and clubs was clubs
You could tell the real MC's from all the scrubs
When havin your own style and originality
And your character and real personality
But I have to go, and off I sign
If I can turn back the hands of time

[Chorus] - 2X w/ ad libs

[Biz Markie]
I wish there was somethin made
Bring back Aaliyah! (Jam Master Jay)
I wish there was somethin made to bring back Biggie and Tupac
I wish there was somethin made to bring back Scott LaRock
I wish somethin bad, I wish there was somethin made
to bring back, Left Eye (Barry White)
I wish there was somethin to bring back my man Dahsil Masterdon
I wish there was somethin made to bring back my man Keith Cowboy
My man B.O., my man Step from Baltimore
I wish there was somethin to bring back
all the strange people that I knew that, was a part of my life
(For all of our loved ones that have passed away)</pre>
