[Geechi Suede]
Pink lemonade on my mink
Link Minute Maid sink get my drink
Then I blink I'm a burn the scene
Suede; he's a shooting star
Chee; he's a movie star
Ski; Hollywood get you stripin'
Probably would then
Hottest emcee
Red and yellow 'zay feelin easy
Mami wonder wild sex
How it feel?

[Sonny Cheeba]
Not feel ya ma, Pimp fire
Shot vodka gotcha
Get higher
Bang on chest, King Kong flame mya
Tap my cane swing long magic wire
Straight out the Congo
Disguising condo
Red light
Bongos, cobra Damillo
Sex night
Nobody's gonna drip on my poncho
That right
Kissin' the gorilla walk broads

<chorus>
[Sonny Cheeba]
If you Gorilla Pimp drag it on the floor
Grab her by the hair and drag her on the floor
Tilt that cock and drag it on the floor
Take them rim stockings and drag it on the floor

repeat

[Sonny Cheeba]
Spin on twin eagles face
Crimson
Toss it, Classic, Automatic
Clinching
Walk on my tip-toes, cell holds
Pimpin
Here's a little mary jane
Now them dames
Swimmin
Satin Water World
Women on Women
Lo-a in between them
Just Gorilla Pimpin'

[Geechi Suede]
Malibu white
Nirvana glimmer glitter at night
Spending these breeze on green
And swimmin in the daily's electro light
Blow Tiajuana
Lubricate my number nine
Slow when you wanna
Glide make this stallion ride
Aaaaah
Manoeuvre v's and be switching lanes
Yoooou
You mezmorized on the candy cane
Weeeee
Smile off Henney inside my Suede-a cave
Lo blow
Slo-mo
Poo'? No
Oh No

<chorus>

[Geechi Suede]
We style Lo
Make this slither off the tongue, mama
We style Lo
Spillin Asian Rum
We gon' make you numb
Fly high
Blend sky like Thai
Never end
Cross t's
Dot i's
On Gorilla Pimp shit

[Sonny Cheeba]
Gorilla Pimp
Gorilla Pimp
Gorilla Pimp
Ha  Gorilla Pimp
