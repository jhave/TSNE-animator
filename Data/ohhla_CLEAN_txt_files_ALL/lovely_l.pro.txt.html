[Intro: Scotty]
Lovely lady, I like the things you say
The things you do, that makes you a
Lovely lady, through the ups and the downs
Smiles and the frowns, you always around

[Prodigal Sunn]
I take you back when I first met her, I had the leather
New better, than a sweater plated, smooth as a love letter
Checkin' the action, pretty eyes, attractin'
Sunzini in the place to be, ladies, what's happening?
Lights, cameras, baby, I'm not your amateur
Put it on you, good hood, P-Sunn the damager
I called a glimpse and from a distance, and in an instance
Approach her a like a queen, show her that my chi is king
Manueve a piece on the scene clean, pardon me miss
Excuse me, I think I seen you in a magazine
Peace Queen, I be the God Sunzini
She said I'm Irene, a pleasure to meet you, but only love I greet ya
All smiles, plus she dug my demeanor
She can tell I was a lover on reefer, we got deeper
Conversation fascinatin', spectacular
Energy post-satan, she was feeling the flatula

[Chorus: Scotty]
Lovely lady, I like the things you say
The things you do, that makes you a
Lovely lady, through the ups and the downs
Smiles and the frowns, you always around
Lovely lady, and you starting it right
Beauty's tight, girl you light up the night
Lovely ladies, yeah, and I must confess
You do it the best, and pass all tests

[Prodigal Sunn]
Good loving from beginning to end, through thick and thin
Together we in, indented like juice and gin
Tighten the loose ends, notice Sunn will stay producing
Skip the illusion, she screamin 'Zini do it again
Gaspin' for action, psyche, attackin' with passion
Bitin' the neck, squeezin' her chest, romancin'
Hit her fast, slow, keep it on the low, Assassin
Sixty Seconds on the clock, and I'm still mashin'
Shape-shape, bodily fashion, pussy's smashin'
Couldn't get enough of the dragon, the sea captain
You know the happening's, for now I'm strappin'
First rules of intercourse, get no bear backing
Smackin', hit her with the monkey wrench
Shorty had bank, like Merrill Lynch
But she loved to get her nipples pinched
Pardon my French, I love them ladies
I got admit, sometimes they drive you crazy

[Chorus]

[Prodigal Sunn]
I love 'em sweet, sexy and smart, sparkin' with a lot of soul
And baby, if you left me, I can be your pot of gold
I show you how to roll it, Sunn, will never fold
Silent as a rocket, completin' in control
Alotta rockets sold, did my thing around the globe
The greatest story never told, written in the scrolls
I treat you like a rose, let you know I'm hear to grow
Forget so and so, selfish jealous silly hoes
Lace you with precious, stoned, amazed by your pretty tone
Baby girl bone, mommy got it going on
Boo, I treat you right, I never ever treat you wrong
You listen to the words of this song, love you long
And I'm keep it strong, slide it up in them thongs
A rump-a-pump-pum, hit it up, like a drum
Fe-fi-fo-fum, here I come, come
Come get some, girl, if you want some

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
