(J-Dawg)
Let's get it straight, boy off top!  I ain't no bitch and you know it
Cuz I'm the type of nigga to cock my shit, pop it and throw it
No serial number so FUCK IT
Jump in the bucket and mash
I value life, but when I ride tonight I'm bustin' yo ass
FUCK A NO MASK!!! Look at my fuckin' face when I blast!
Play the role of Schwarzanegger and start erasin' yo ass
I know you, claimin', but I'm bout to see if you bout it for real
Got a thirty round magazine that's crowded with steel
Now I'm about to see how you respond, under pressure
Like elastic, in a big nigga draws, I'm bout to stretch ya
Tryin' to wet'cha, from the neck up, ain't no vest up there
Ever heard of a gang of niggas who don't give a fuck?
Well that's us playa
Better roll or get rode on, too late to be hollerin' peace and some truce
I'ma jack ya, before I wack ya bitch now reach for the roof
Hit 'em up with the B-double-M that's, Black Menace Mafia nigga
Ask them lil' Providence pillars, Dogg it ain't no stoppin' them niggas
Bitch I'ma, solja

(Chorus: Tim Smooth)
Pimped out how you define us
HARD IN THE BOOT
Real niggas is on the line-uh...
CALLIN' THE TROOPS
Spanked is how they wind up
DARK AIN'T FOR YOU
You gotta respect my mind, bruh
TIME'S UP

(Threat)
Hey partna, pump yo brakes and stay the fuck outta mine
Keep that gossip goin' on and Threat'll be up in that iron
For you that's nothin' to find
Niggas begin rushin' time
Fuckin' with mine you outta line believe I'm bustin' for mine
Only I trusted my nine
Still a-ddicted to crime
On the grind, duckin' the swine
Can't put no trust in my kind
Straight up it's all bout design
Don't let it fuck with your mind
Dolla sign be the reason niggas be stuck in the blind
Dog, we so far behind, some still is findin' the block
God as my witness I'm prayin' for this nickel and dime shit to stop
Pour out some wine on the spot, for the ones who couldn't be here
For me here
It's hard as a solja, tryin' to stay sober
Feelin' like life is over
Debatin' with too many haters
Gotta look over the shoulder to say, not too many players
Lay me down to sleep, but I'm just not ready
To rest in peace with no bitch niggas
My figure's not steady
Camped out nigga!!!

Chorus

(Tim Smooth)
I gave you life, what you do?  Forget what I did
Made you tight, that's the type of BITCH that you is
It's splittin' my wig, how you even live with no guilt
But hoe shit is what could get a hoe killed
NOTICE, how you jockin' my style cuz I'm a classic
You ain't Tim!  You're like Mit trick, you're backwards!
And after, your skirt is exposed you'll get to see me
Hit'cha with these, cuz you're just a bitch to me
Picture this'll be a blow for a hoe
Whoever catch it
It's meant for you sucka, push it up ya and wet it
And set it off when you see me comin'
I'm bout that
Yank that bra off, cuz he a woman
I doubt that you want this here, cuz you just appear to be hard
But'cha lackin' action like a security guard
Hearin' the noise you're talkin' plus I don't see nothin' happenin'
I'm ready to bust your back in more ways than fuckin' rappin'
Cuz you askin' for somethin' that's too much to consume
On the front line or in your front room
I'm downin' you, then I'm duckin' out
And I'm replacin' my name, with my dick in your muthafuckin' mouth
Camped out!!!!
Camped out!!!!
Camped out!!!!
Camped out!!!!
Camped out!!!!
