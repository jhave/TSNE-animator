[Missy Elliott] 
Hey mommy what a playaaaaaa? 
Yo, yo, yo yo yo yo yo (x4) 
Black, black, black 
(Ms. Parker what you suckin' on?) 
Standin' on the bus stop suckin' on a lollipop 
 
[Static (Missy)]
Hey, hey Ms. Parker what's you address? 
(Yo Yo, whatchu say, Static?) 
Hey Ms. Parker can I caress? 
 
[Black]
Mmm Ms. Parker glad to meet you 
Mmm mmm Ms. Parker I do need you 
Tell 'em now 
 
[Chorus- Playa] 
Listen to my heartbeat 
Feel my wet lips 
Ms. Parker don't you trip 'cause 
Girl I know you want me 
Listen to my finger snaps 
You dig the way I roll 
And the way a brotha act? 
And your ex can't top that 
 
[Smokey (Playa)]
Oh oh Ms. Parker what's that up your skirt? 
Oh oh oh Ms. Parker you know I'm a flirt 
Oh oh oh Ms. Parker can I ride with you? 
(I've never seen this side of you) 
And if you've got time to listen 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Missy Elliott rap] 
Y'all know 'bout Ms. Parker 
Capital P-A-rker 
Lived at the corner of Fort Ruckus and Walker 
Always a talker, late booty caller 
Big squeeze them nuts, them spaghetti meat 
Baller stalker watch Ms. Parker get freaky 
Smoke too much reefa 'til she cheeky 
Ms. Parker got the mara weekly 
Give me funk 'til I'm stinkin' 
And if you wanna battle come and see me 
Check it one time 
 
[Chorus to fade]</pre>
