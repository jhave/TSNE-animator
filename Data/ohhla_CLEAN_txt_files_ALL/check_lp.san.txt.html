[Juelz Santana]
I been paying attention to what's going on out there man (yep)
I been watching you niggaz stealing my ways and shit (uh-huh)
And it's getting out of control now (out of control)
I'ma telling you dudes like I tell my woman (listen)
Don't watch me, watch TV This is pay-per-view you gotta pay for this Aye!

[Verse 1]
First, let me take time to brush my shoulders off
Wait...I had to dust my shoulders off
Thanks, y'all been waiting, been patient, been anxious
Now I herefore bring back me, your greatness (yes)
The rap Ali, jab I weave
Then come back with the same jab times three
I blow smoke to the heaven I'm so close to perfection
Rap's one big casino, I'm plotting Ocean Eleven (ay)
I might have sold the least
But I still manage to be most feared by most emcees (good)
Who holding me Who close to me
For sho papi, nobody yeah that's how it's supposed to be
Now listen you can either comprehend it or compliment it
It's all authentic (yep)
But you better believe whatever I say
Guess what you can bet it all I meant it (AYE)

[Hook]
Mic check one two one two (one two)
Mic check one two one two (one two)
Mic check one two what is this
Santana's back to business, let's go (ay)
Mic check one two one two (check)
Mic check one two one two (check)
Mic check one two what is this
Santana's back to business, let's go

(Verse 2]
Bad news, rap dudes, I'm back fools
Give the thrown up, this is that jack move (jack move)
Ha-choo I just sneezed and the track moved (ha-choo)
God blessed me, yes that's true
So bright, throw lights up for me
For life married the game, throw rice up for me (yes)
So nice, throw ice up for me (yes)
Two pieces for B.I.G. and one piece for tha kid (yes)
I am back yup put a stack up
Let it down set it down now I'm 'bout to act up
For you to get rid of me you'll need about 50 G's
In army fatigues ready to bleed please believe (Wow)
If you catch me pushing a whip
It's a new coupe wit a lip
Or something foreign I'll never forget
Yes I'm the man bet I'm the man
Am I here to save the day? Oh yes I definitely am

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Look homie quick homie
Get a camera get a flick (yes)
Get a load of this homie
I spit homie the flow so sick homie
Once again I'm back this is it homie
The album's done, which mean the album's coming
Spent a while but (fuck) it
This time around I'm fronting
I done styled and stunted
I done wild in public I done paid my dues
Did my hundred miles and running Now I'm back (ay)..</pre>
