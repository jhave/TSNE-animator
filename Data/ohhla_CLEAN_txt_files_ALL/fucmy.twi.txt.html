Demons and ghosts from outta the dark
Is it just my mind cause they keep rippin' me apart
I gotta deal with this, that I'm not everybody else
And they're all just better than me so fuck myself
Livin' to die, dyin' to live, hatin' to give
Into the bullshit, I wish but it won't quit
Can't somebody stop this, I need some fuckin' help
Cause they're all just better than me so fuck myself

Everybody spits in my face
Everybody spits the same and it really hits on the vein of me
This is the very meaning of hate
The very reason I been committed and labelled a technical basket case
Please, I just can't take it anymore
Attackin' me from every angle soon as I walk in the door
Harder and harder, you just kept pushin' and pushin'
Till I was farther and farther away from all of the bullshit
And now I'm the person you always wanted me to be
A loser just like my daddy to the highest degree
Well it ain't for me, that I go out and go away
Before my life is just a repeat of that motherfucker's story
This shit is legendary, you can like it or not
Say what you say, the other way or handle it on the spot
And my feelings are irrelevant to all the games and jokes
Sometimes I feel a little provoked to step down

Demons and ghosts from outta the dark
Is it just my mind cause they keep rippin' me apart
I gotta deal with this, that I'm not everybody else
And they're all just better than me so fuck myself
Livin' to die, dyin' to live, hatin' to give
Into the bullshit, I wish but it won't quit
Can't somebody stop this, I need some fuckin' help
Cause they're all just better than me so fuck myself

I don't respect you or expect you to
Die for me, even though I would die for you
Cause life tries to manipulate and dominate
Bringin' no one aroudn you in emotional state
Man I know that I ain't shit, it ain't no fuckin' secret
I never had shit and I'll never be shit
But I'm cool with it, I ain't even trippin' a bit
I'm a fake, I'm a phoney, and the biggest false prophet
But you're lookin' in the mirror and you're seeing yourself
Better than me, better than you and everybody else
You're a high horse ridin', oh so judgemental
Complex motherfucker, and I'm so simple
But that's ok too, and other than hate you
I embrace you and change the mood you relate to
My feelings are irrelevant to all the games and jokes
Sometimes I feel a little provoked to step down

Demons and ghosts from outta the dark
Is it just my mind cause they keep rippin' me apart
I gotta deal with this, that I'm not everybody else
And they're all just better than me so fuck myself
Livin' to die, dyin' to live, hatin' to give
Into the bullshit, I wish but it won't quit
Can't somebody stop this, I need some fuckin' help
Cause they're all just better than me so fuck myself

You're better than me, you're really better than me
You can't be better than me, I never wanna be, fuck me
I'm better than you, no I'm not better than you
I can't be better than you, nor do I want to, fuck you

You're better than me, you're really better than me
You can't be better than me, I never wanna be
I'm better than you, no I'm not better than you
I can't be better than you, nor do I want to

Demons and ghosts from outta the dark
Is it just my mind cause they keep rippin' me apart
I gotta deal with this, that I'm not everybody else
And they're all just better than me so fuck myself
Livin' to die, dyin' to live, hatin' to give
Into the bullshit, I wish but it won't quit
Can't somebody stop this, I need some fuckin' help
Cause they're all just better than me so fuck myself</pre>
