[Nelly]
Now if you gonna ride 
Get inside lets roll
If you runnin yo mouth then
Shit then shut my door 
I ain't got nothing on my hands but time
Tell me were you the one that's on the grind
If you gonna ride 
Get inside lets roll
If you runnin yo mouth then
Shit then shut my door 
I ain't got nothing on my hands but time
Tell me were you the one that's on the grind
Check it was it you that was on the grind dirty

They actin like they really want it with me
Trust me they don't really want it they just want to be seen
They wanna disrupt my team with these publicity schemes 
Tryin' to dismantle my panel with lies rumors and scandals
But uh I pull through it like I'm tuggin a war
I tell ya the situation like I been here before
I'm still popin dirty still smokin point clickin 
Watchin the doors open 
No jokin e'rything remotin
No chokin or bleedin this ride is for free
No matter what u got your dying for free
Automatically I'm focused like 35 millimeters
All of the sudden like such and such wanna meet us
All of the sudden like such and such wanna greet us
The same will you believe us 
Now they all tryin to cheat us 
In real life they can't beat us
Some time they try to repeat us 

[Hook]

Why is they yackin like they fuckin with these? (I don't know)
Why is they stuntin like they holdin the keys? (tell me)
Them type of people don't be holdin no heat (naw)
Then how the fuck they gon be rollin with me (uh)
Dude how the hell you ain't gonna waste yo time (wait yo time)
Yo mouth gonna fuck around and gonna waste yo time (ey)
I don't them nigga that ain't gonna grind
When its peso time come out and take yo shine dirty 
I'm the same nigga that's outta control (outta control)
I put a little malinger out on the roll (ey)
The bigger it just got the calico I been cockin and loadin
I been poppin in fours (uh)
Set that aside cuz I gotta get those (gotta get those)
The finest shit then what you proud of me for (tell me)
The dirty either you gonna ride or you don't (uh)
Inside there's more shit if not we're gone nigga

[Hook]

uh uh uh uh uh uh you tell em
Watch me now I'm spiffy now
Smoke sticky now and the Mrs. pick me now
You tell 'em watch me now I'm spiffy now
Smoke sticky now and the Mrs. pick me now
Well if said it I done it if I done it I did it
And if I, And if I want it if don't put it against it 
The way that I should spend it to get just how I should
All money ain't good money but no money ain't good
I took the hood tactics and plot with musical talents
Tryin to create a balance
In between Minnesota and Dallas
Never matters when I'm speakin
If you peepin just let me know
I'm guaranteed to keep it crackin just like eggs hittin the flo
I'm dottin just wanna be I ask
Clippin the wings I wanna fly ass
Only Q and D. Miles can look down on me
Maybe I should bee bee in my head 
I puts it down homie

[Hook x2]

You tell em watch me now I'm spiffy now
Smoke sticky now and the Mrs. pick me now
You tell em watch me now I'm spiffy now
Smoke sticky now and the Mrs. pick me now ey</pre>
