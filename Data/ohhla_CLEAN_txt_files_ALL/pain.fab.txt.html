Song:   Pain
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a fuck
Rather hold my high and die then live and duck
If you're cool being taken down and giving up
Your lifestyle's a blow job, the way you're living sucks!
I done felt pain, waited but no help came
Went through some crazy shit still kept myself sane
You ever been dying of thirst and smelt rain
Ever been told "go to hell" and felt flames
The water's to your neck and only gets deeper
Its all down hill and it only gets steeper
Gotta get over it, be a hurdle leaper
It cost to be the boss, it ain't get no cheaper
But there's a man above that we all under bro
No bread truck but he work wonders though!
After you wake up, everything is wonderful
You can overcome anything you undergo
As an artist I'm just tryna paint the perfect picture
But see where tryna wait for somebody that's perfect gets you
That usually lead to nothing like virgin kisses
And I be tryna cut, surgeon bitches
Dreams of splurging riches, pretty but curvy misses
Chef to serve the dishes, driving to swerve the ditches
I'm just another kid on the purple wishes?
And the streets is tough, on the verge of viscious
So I sold weed and crack, business
That white girl helped a nigga, Fergalicious
But getting money bring jealousy and verbal disses
So when you killin' shit watch out for the murder witness
An old head told me, let nothing disturb your business
Beef is only good when you in the burger business
So I chilled, but loaded up the steal
Like I wish a nigga would, But I know a nigga will
But for real you loaded up to kill
Cause soon as a nigga could the sooner a nigga will
And I don't owe these niggaz nothing
Put that in a nigga will</pre>
