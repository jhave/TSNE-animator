Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I need all my money
I want all my cash

She said I was her cousin
... nigga was her man
... see all I want is
... show all the signs
I was looking for... time
... never talk about it
After party
No man with a...
You all nigga wanna have some fun
She wanna love me...

See that's bad for business
Therefore I had to lie
Therefore she got to learn
I ain't going no where
For your concern girl

[Chorus]
I need a respirator
I need an ambulance
Girl I'll die without you
[Repeat]

Black girl put you bottie on the floor
Don't stop now
Girl I'll die without you
You got a body that will kill
Keep dancing
Girl I'll die without you
[Repeat]

I wanna place an order
You're number one you can keep the change
Yes shorty I got the...
She works... you can leave with me
Miss independent
Til I stop breaking...
... the girl I met
Uuu back and further she can't go...
Gave me your body
Got me thinking I'm the only one
Now baby girl get the...
Should I be... my twitter
She got a man
But I wanna be with her

[Chorus]

Girl drop it low
Pick it up
Don't stop
No no no
Take your love
And my heart my stuff
No no no
Falling in love
Up in this club
Watching them bring me
Bottles of love
Baby are you taking me home?
Girl if you don't I'll...

[Chorus]</pre>
