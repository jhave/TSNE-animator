I'ma bust it off like this for Compton
Yo! Whassup? Yo.. what's happenin, what's happenin?
E-Swift, you cuttin the records nice boy
DJ Pooh whassup man? We all chillin
Yo, yo, J-Ro's in the house, we all cold coolin out y'knahmsayin?
And I'ma bust it off like this for Compton
Look who sprung up, comin the fuck up

I came in the place to let you know what's up
with a bunch of trunk jewerly
Two or three fat gold chains, ring plates with my name on 'em
Yeah I rhyme fly, real fly Hobbes
I wear Nike's cause I run from the cops
Pops taught me lots he said "Toys are for tots"
At four, bought me a box, when I was six I wore a jock
cause, my jimmy was gettin kinda big
At nine I was a kid but I took my first swig
Hugged that Olde English beer
So my peers wouldn't think that I was queer
Yeah, right off I got the title of a gangsta
Pranksters run because they know that there ain't a
person, runnin a verse on like this, hahahaha..
Whassup?  This at your own risk, sucker

"This at your own risk.." This at your own risk!  Uhh!
"Marley Marl remix.." This at your own risk SUCKER!
"This at your own risk.." This at your own risk!
"This at your own risk.." This at your own risk!

People always say, "Are you the King of the West?"
But there's always some pest who try to put you to the test
even though, they know I'm King, I'm on a higher level
I even dust the church and sold they soul to the devil
I mean really, how you think I'm livin?
On the strength I'm livin like Thanksgiving
So yo, whassup turkey, tryin to jerk me?
Your rhymes don't work see, you can't hurt T
The almighty individual, you said you knew
but I don't think you really know about
the K-I-N-G super cool mack daddy
I drive a Caddy, and I'm livin fatly
Had me on stage in a rage
Yellin was what ya know, that's how I get paid
Made my mark but rappers still insist, to diss
but yo it's at your own risk sucker

"This at your own risk.." This at your own risk!  C'mon, SUP?
"Marley Marl remix.." - "Marley Marl remix single of.."
"This at your own risk.." This at your own risk!
"This at your own risk.." This at your own risk!
Bust the break!

Verse three!
Is another one for those to remember 
King Tee is the champ, smashin all contenders
For those who disbelieve, just step in my direction
I'm snappin arms, legs and even necks and
suckers who thrive to drive me crazy
You know the ones who front tryin to amaze me
Take it as a warnin cause I'm hopin that you don't diss
But get a load of this, it's at your own risk..
sucker!

"This at your own risk.." This at your own risk!
"This at your own risk.." This at your own risk!
"This at your own risk.." This at your own risk!
"This at your own risk.." This at your own risk!

{*Marley Marl cuts and scratches*}

C'mon get funky, get, get funky
C'mon c'mon get funky
