[Intro]
Wooo! Rk... Rk what!?
We're the believers, do you believe us?

[Chorus]
I can find my place in my dreams
(In my dreams, in my, in my dreams)
Yeah I can find my place in my dreams

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's that kid with the British accent
Still kicking and bringing us wicked raps when
Other rappers lack sense, innovation absent
Take that in to the count like your bank said
Yeah, let me set the rhythm
And these texts are spinning
We be best in Britain
When I say best, I mean best at livin
As the best decision
To see lesser limits

We aim higher
Higher than Mariah in a choir or the guy who chews up bubbles in a wire
Desire, to leave behind, the reason why
As little as, read to find, our recent times
I'm paying what I wanna be like a portrait
You let other people paint you (portrait)
All day, I have more faith, than what you'll say
But you're foretelling to talk straight
And I know

[Chorus]
I can find my place in my dreams
Said I can find my place in my dreams

I don't care what you choose as fact
I'm gonna take myself to the moon and back
In my dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams
(My dreams)

Straight up me to the sand, Imma spaceman
Yeah, with a suit to match
In my dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams

[Verse 2]
Yeah, imma grafter
Check it or the grit on my Nike's
Delivering these lyrics like I'm big in the 90's
I love rhythm, and I sit on it nicely
Your chicks' lips, take it cos she Rizzle's it nicely
Yeah
It's far from a mission to find me
Kicking it in Camden
Spitting with Hynze
And if you like, I'd just listen to high beats
well i'll leave you swimming with fishes you Pisces
I'm getting ready for stress days
How I rap now ain't the best way
To earn money and tea
It seems like rapping like you're dumb as (woo!)
That's how you get paid
Well, I'm not on that
I'm different, I love rap I'm living
Wrong that, you're kidding
All facts considered
You made me believe your make-believe
[?] in a Batman figures, Yeah!

[Chorus]
I can find my place in my dreams
Said I can find my place in my dreams

I don't care what you choose as fact
I'm gonna take myself to the moon and back
In my dreams
(My dreams) [x4]

Straight up me to the sand, Imma spaceman
Yeah, with a suit to match
In my dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams

[Bridge]
I can find that place, up in my dreams tonight
Where you and I, don't have to fight
Over what is right or wrong
It's not you who decides
Oh this is my life

[Verse 3]
I said think of all those stupid things that you've ever said to me
Put it in perspective and then tell me that you don't agree
I'm not telling you to think what I think
While your point of view just really ain't my cup of tea
I wish everyone could all live in harmony
When people made decisions
It was always made impartially
I find it hard to speak
Suppose I'm always half asleep
Doesn't change the fact that I've never made a half a speech

Yeah I'm feeling spaced out
What
A place for the believers
That don't becue then leave us
We need some dreamers to feature
(I'm feeling spaced out)
Spaced out
Yeah, I'm feeling spaced out

Yeah, now I wanna stomp on the moon
Stomp on it
Stomp on the moon
Stomp on it, stomp on it [x4]

I don't care what you choose as fact
I'm gonna take myself to the moon and back
In my dreams
(My dreams) [x4]

Straight up me to the sand, Imma spaceman
Yeah, with a suit to match
In my dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams
(My dreams)
