(Esham Talking)
Got my boys back up in here,
We had to time warp back in time,

(Chourus)
Whoa,Whoa,Whoa,Whooooa, (x2) (In the 50's)

Verse One:
Know, I lay me down to sleep,
I pray to the lord that my bird wont creep,
And if she do, Before I wake,
Please let her have more bread to break,
Like a house on a lake,
For goodness sake,
Her name is Little Debbie, and I love her cake,
Make's no diffrence to me,
A key to a "G", still adding up money,
Lovely, keep ya water on bubbly,
What would you do If you was me,
Probally, G of or key-off,
And sniff it all up,
Until you blow your fucking head off,

(Chrous)
Dream, Dream, Dream, Dream, Dream, Baby (x4)

Verse Two:
I thought I saw a pussy-cat,
I didnt, It was a dirty rat,
In fact, it was a snake, bitch kiss it,
Spitting venom, always dissing, missing,
the whole point of whatimsayin',
Because your bling,
Dream, Dream, Dream,
When I rode by on bleem,
You see me clean,
Looking at me like a fiend,
It was obseen,
With a beauty of the week out of JET magazine,

(Chrous) fade away!!!!!</pre>
