[Eminem - Intro]
A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit I don't know
But I do know, I'm back now
HAHA

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me
I'm underground

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me
I'm underground

[Eminem - Verse 1]
Dre I'm down here, under the ground dig me up
Broken tibias fibias, yeah fix me up
Sixty sluts all of 'em dying from asphyxia
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeves sippy cup
dixy cups toxins boxes of oxy pads
enough Oxycontin to send a fucking ox to rehab
wack job in the back with a black stocking cap
jacking off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
[you can't say that] yes he can
I just did faggot now guess again
better text message your next of kin
tell him shits about to get extra messy especially when
I flex again and throw a fucking lesbian in wet cement
So faggoty faggoty faggoty raggedy Ann and Andy
NO raggedy Andy and Andy no it can't be, it can't be
Yes it can be the fucking anti christ is back Danny
its Satan in black satin panties
this is Amityville calamity got damnit insanity pills
fanny pack filled with Xanax
through every nook and cranny
lookin for trannys milk and cookies spilt on my silk negligee looky 
Razor balades wit me to make you bleed
cases of Maybeline make up lay on the table of weed
slim shady shit sounds like a fable to me
until he jumps out the fucking toilet when you're taking a pee

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me
I'm underground

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me
I'm underground

[Eminem - Verse 2]
Six semen samples Seventeen strands of hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot at Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe with canopy beds
With glad bags, yeah glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dab in rehab
Fucking doctor I didn't understand a damn what he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I aint enlighten
Bitin' into a fucking Vicodin like I 'am viking
Oh, lightning strike it might be a fucking sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck Jason it's Friday the nineteenth
That means it's just a regular day
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fucking Lesbians shouldn't of had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay
Missing both legs and begging to stay

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me
I'm underground

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me
I'm underground

[Eminem  Verse 3]
Tell the critics I'm back and I'm coming
To spit back an abundance
Hit a fag with onions
Then split a bag of Funions
Mad at me understandable
Cannibal shooting animal
Out of a cannon and have him catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back to a Trick of Treat holiday
Have Michael Myers looking like a liar
Swipe his powers replace his knife with flowers and a stack of flyers
Hit Jason Voorhees with a forty                  
Stuck a suppository up his ass
And made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lecter a fucking nectarine
And sat him in the fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture
Walked up elm street with a fucking whiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too
And came out with a little scratch oww
Looking like I got into a fucking pillow fight with a triple fat goose
INSANITY CAN IT BE VANITY, WHERES THE HUMANITY 
IN HAVIN A TWIST OF FANTASY WITH A ARM AN LEG AMPUTEE
straight jacket with 108 brackets
and a strap the wraps twice around my back then they latch it
cut ya fuckin head off and ask where you headed off to?
get it headed off too? medic this headaches awful
this anesthetic's pathetic so is this diabetic waffle   
and this prosthetic arm keeps crushin my hard taco</pre>
