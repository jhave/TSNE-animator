[Hook: Chingy]
Throw yo hood up if you representin
(Northside, Westside, Southside, Eastside)
All my fly day numbered, hustlas baby
Throw yo hood up if you representin'
(Westside, Northside, Eastside, Southside)
All my fly day numbered, gangstas baby
Throw yo hood up if you representin'

[Verse 1: Chingy]
Gangsta as a Cadillac DeVille wit fo's
This for all my thundercats that feel my flow
To slang weight, my young guns will steal ya o's
Catch a bellin down Lukerson &amp; Hunt de-real a ho
In ya top piece, suburb mart, ya not street
I know fools from Wilson that'll whack ya, ya got beef
Used to go to Skate King back when bangin was in
And if the fiends aint have 20, we would slang it for 10
Drankin' the gin, posted on the corners at night
Sparkin pound while my homies in the street, slapped right
Ride bikes, patrolin' the hood, keepin' out cops
Regals and drops, reppin' cuz beak in my block
Wild like rocks, my mentality got from my pops
And saints, bustin back in '90 hope you got from the shots
Put it down for the town and I gang wit us
St. Louis did it derty, throw yo hood up did you know we from the.

[Hook: Chingy]
(Northside, Westside, Southside, Eastside)
All my fly day numbered, hustlas baby
Throw yo hood up if you representin'
(Westside, Northside, Eastside, Southside)
All my fly day numbered, gangstas baby
Throw yo hood up if you representin'
(Northside, Eastside, Southside, Westside)
All my fly day numbered, playas baby
Throw yo hood up if you representin'
(Eastside, Southside, Westside)
All my fly day numbered, thugs baby
Throw yo hood up if you representin'

[Verse 2: Tity-Boi]
Tity-Boi, Southside
Bad limp, fo' 5's on the hip
Don't know why I'm known to slip when I get high
One time but no more, won't sleep until the mornin'
Somebody need to take the trash out and I'ma do the chores
Softer than a cactus, put it on like actors
Hustle in the shadows on the bricks and they couldn't catch us
Gat still tucked, in my waist by my price time
Cuz my chain hang so low my tongue bang wit my pipe line
Walk around, all day wit this beam like it's night time
You can see em a mile away, but it'll touch ya from blind side
Flipped it, first to finsih to the car, that's a nice ride
Dig it, they spin they puchase round here they get kite high
Deal it, it's my description, my picture, my composure plot
This is how I get through 2 d's, niggaz!
My side we ride my crew's, iller, iller!

[Hook: Chingy]
Throw yo hood up if you representin'
(Northside, Westside, Southside, Eastside)
All my fly day numbered, hustlas baby
Throw yo hood up if you representin'
(Westside, Northside, Eastside, Southside)
All my fly day numbered, gangstas baby
Throw yo hood up if you representin'
(Northside, Eastside, Southside, Westside)
All my fly day numbered, playas baby
Throw yo hood up if you representin'
(Eastside, Southside, Westside)
All my fly day numbered, thugs baby
Throw yo hood up if you representin'

[Verse 3: I-20]
Who done bust through the vapon yeah I'm hopin' to fight
Start a brawl, I'll shut that bitch down on openin' night
Let's fate, pull the bitches titties start on them dipes
Cause we leavin' wit some hoes and yeah we startin' wit dykes
Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand if you holdin' that bank
I got the game on lock, you barely a holdin' tank
Get drunk, get to shootin bust the whole club out
Us thugs out, I'm tryin' to dumb out, 'til I get drunk out
That's just the way I am, don't look down on me
My gun's a open bar, free rounds on me
And I'm an eastside nigga so I aint no punk
I make the crowd get it crunk and do the eastside stomp
Young Chingy let em know, that the deal is a fool
And I'm a carpenter's dream, I'm in love wit the tools
Lay low when the heat bust, off in the airr
DTP, Cris squad and we runnin' this herre, it go
