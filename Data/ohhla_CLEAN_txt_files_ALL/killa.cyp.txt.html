[B-Real]
Living in the city of the Scandalous
Shisty motherfuckers, can't even trust my own brothers
So who can I choose to trust, me, that's who
Niggas want a piece of the pie, fuck off and die!
Jealous, envious fools want to rush this
Loco, trooping ass nigga with the cash, shit
Motherfuckers just get your own, and leave mine alone
Forty-five places to get done
Send out your invitation
To the party of your elimination
I got peeps that play for keeps, (Hardball)
Now I'm laying your ass down to sleep
But every hustler wants to be bawling
But I got the balls for the shot calling
I pull strings, the Don King, only in America
Then I hustle, and flex my muscle

[Hustlers]
--Yeah, man, I've been out here 
  running game for eight years
--I know I'm getting tired of standing
  on this corner
--Nigga, I want a fat pad, and fly ass pool
  Finest motherfucking bitches, jewels 
  and all that shit, if I got to take it
  from a nigga
--Shit, let him run for me then
--I can work for myself, don't have to 
  work for nobody, I'll be my own hustler

[B-real]
Where can I roam to get my hustle on
Killafornia, stacking the chips, got the full clips
Loaded and cocked, I'm used to running with the Glock
Nina Millimeter, lighting up the fucking block
Now, who you gonna trust?, who can you trust?
I don't know, but if you coming on my corner
I think I'm gonna bust
You can't handle us, devious, dangerous
Criminal mentality, insanity
I move weight, from state to state
All the niggas moving weights, can you relate?

[Hustlers]
--Damn, what's up, I see you 
  pushing that big time weight
--I told you, I wasn't bullshitting
--You coming up, aight!  
--When I seen you three or four
  months ago I told you
--Got respect for a man now
--Handle your shit!

[B-Real]
Where can I choose to get my hustle on?
In the alleyway, lighting up all night long
Fuck working at McD's, I'm rolling with the O.Z's 
In the QP's, puffing on trees
Who can I trust?, who can you trust?
Not that shady motherfucker in the city Los Scandalous

[Hustlers]
--Well, well, little man came up a little bit
--It feels good having money in the pocket
--Fuck that nine to five bullshit, right?
--Yeah, kick that shit to the curb
--But you got to look out for the scandalous motherfuckers
  Cuz niggas is tricky than a motherfucker
--Yeah, but motherfuckers got to look out for us too
  You know what I'm saying
  I'm just as shisty as a nigga
--Shit, set me up and niggas are gonna die
--You get set up back, cuz we ain't having that bullshit
--I got your back, you got mine, that goes without saying
--Twenty-seven and mo' baby, twenty-seven and mo'
--Let's get the fuck out of here"</pre>
