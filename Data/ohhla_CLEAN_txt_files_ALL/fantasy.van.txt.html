Oh yea...In my dreams I envision myself at the ocean
Beautiful girls rubbin' me down with some lotion
Even though you know I flow as cold as an ice cube
Let me tell you how it is to make love on an inner tube
Floatin' on water while splashin' waves on your body
Flowni' and goin', now pump it, pump it, Hottie
See, I wanna get loose with you, is that all right?
Girl, I wanna' do it outside, under the moonlight
And get on down so we can make that love
You be the hand and Iceman'll be the glove
This is your fantasy, your highest dream
Fulfillin' all your pleasures the utmost extreme

Yea...Life is just a fantasy...Yea..

Now, let me take you out so we can wine and dine
As I pull you close you pull your lips next to mine
Oh yeah, you like it like that
You like it like I do and that's where it's at
So later on that night as we got in my car
It started up again we didn't get very far
You made it very clear that you were not in fear
Leaned over to me and started kissin' my ear
Oh girl, you feel so good
You couldn't wait to get home and I understood
As we got busy, then I pulled up in the driveway
You said follow me 'cause we're gonna do it my way
Walked in the front door you startin' strippin' clothes
Turned off the lights and assumed the pose
Closer and closer, hot anticipation
You walked into the closet, came out in some lace and
I almost lost my mind, but I kept it in tact
The lace you was wearin' ohhh, I got an attack
'Cause this is your fantasy, your highest dream
Fulfillin' all your pleasures to the utmost extreme

Yea...Life is just a fantasy
Yea...Life is just a fantasy

Come on baby and let me be your toy
I'll let you do as you wish just to give you joy
And get down, I know you wanna' get loose
Let's do it like a train and I'll be the caboose
Or better yet, I'll take you higher, I think that it's time
To make love to you baby on cloud number nine
As we start pumpin', sweat pour down my chest
And that's when you know Vanilla Ice is the best
You say ooh, ah, ooh, ooh, ah
I don't know what it means but I like it a lot
This is your fantasy, your highest dream
Fulfillin' all your pleasures to the utmost extreme
Yea...Life is just a fantasy
O yea...Life is just a fantasy...Oh girl...</pre>
