(Sample)
"Our skin and blood, the iron bars of confinement.
But fear not. All flesh decays.
Death turns all to ash.
And thus, 'Death Frees Every Soul'."

[Planet Asia]
My body is a Bentley
My soul is God meaning you rolling wit Allah if you riding wit me
The mystery is death to most
When niggas get clapped and come back believing in ghosts
Some niggas come back and don't remember shit except the incident
Some niggas come back and turn religious
They say the flesh is a just a vessel for the spirit
And the brain is antenna to teleport thoughts to ya vision
But in the mean time we living
The criminal life until they gas us in prison
Back to ether, ashes and urns
Now you just a container of dirt sitting on the speaker
Or somewhere in the Ocean scattered
I was taught heaven or hell was understanding 'Mind Over Matter'
So what's the meaning of death? Nothingness
Most ask by the 85 are like the 25th alphabet
RIP, sent to your doorstep
We miss you very much but your soul is free
From all the pain and the suffering we all must share
So save a spot for the family till we all upstairs

(Sample)

[Sick Jacken]
My body is a six deuce
My soul is old like a classic from all the shit I've been thru
My conscious is infinite tho'
Now I know so I'm taking it slow
I'm 732-to-life and it's taking its toll
Secure my bloodline wit seven seeds
And I put my stories in palm scrolls to bone and skulls
Is all that's left, I'm shine death
I came close but I guess it wasn't time yet
And I wander thru the ages like this
Believing life is a hell and my death would be bliss
While religion promises a heaven
I enjoy what I have now wit no guilt cuz that's what I'm giving
Ashes to ash trays and dust smash brains
I'm just a lost soul navigating path ways
I gotta get it right cuz we're in the last days
Soon we'll meet death, the mysteries of black age
