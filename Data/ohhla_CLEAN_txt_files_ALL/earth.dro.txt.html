   Verse 1
   
   First patient, pull out the skull, remove the cancer
   Breakin' his back, chisel necks for the answer
   Supersonic bionic robot voodoo power
   Equator ex my chance to flex skills on Ampex
   With power meters and heaters gauge anti-freeze
   Octagon oxygen, aluminum intoxicants
   More ways to blow blood cells in your face
   React with four bombs and six fire missiles
   Armed with seven rounds of space doo-doo pistols
   You may not believe, livin' on the Earth planet
   My skin is green and silver, warhead lookin' mean
   Astronauts get played, tough like the ukelele
   As I move in rockets, overriding, levels
   Nothing's aware, same data, same system
   
   Chorus
   
   Earth People, New York and California
   Earth People, I was born on Jupiter x4
   
   Verse 2
   
   Now my helmet's on, you can't tell me I'm not in space
   With the National Guard United States Enterprise
   Diplomat of swing with aliens at my feet
   Comin' down the rampart through beam on the street
   Obsolete computes, compounds and dead sounds
   As I locate intricately independent
   Economic rhymer got savoury store food
   In Capsule D my program is ability
   For a reaction and response to a no-one
   Identification Code: Unidentified
   I got cosmophonic, pressed a button, changed my face
   You recognised, so what? I turned invisible
   Made myself clear, reappeared to you visual
   Disappear again, zapped like a android
   Face the fact, I fly on planets every day
   My nucleus friend, prepare, I return again
   My 7XL is not yet invented
   
   Repeat chorus
   
   Verse 3
   
   Space Ranger, contact tubes, send synthetics
   I program one and go to Earth through the fax machine
   My number's Seven-Oh-Nine Seven-Five-Five Six-E-L-Three
   Computer File: Nine-Three
   Digital level, standing on the terminal
   Upside down through polygons fightin' pentagons
   Changin' blue skin, my brown colour's comin' back
   I'm psychedelic this time, come in rainbow
   Look at the green lights and y'all see my brain glow
   Five colours: yellow, black and red and green...purple
   
   Repeat chorus
