[Declaime]
I'm Declaime running thangs, rock your whole body,
I gotta "Break dat party, Rip dat party"

[Wild Child]
Yo, I'm Wild Child with the style that'll wreck your body,
I'm here to "Break dat party, rip dat party"

[Madlib]
Yo, it's Madlib the beat conductor with the beat to take you under,
I'm gonna "Break dat party, rip dat party"

[All together]
It's Lootpack, Declaime, taking out wack MC's,
We're gonna "Break dat party, rip dat party"

[Declaime]
So you choose to dance with I, the rhyme wise
Who flies by over all heads at a fast rate, from the west state
South Cali poet, you know it to be a Madlib Invazion
And it's gonna take a nation
To hold me back when I attack from all angles,
Setting out traps that entangles, strangles
All you got chokes, can't cope with slow folks,
Break you down like po' folks
Mad agression while in session, never slip or sleep
I be Declaime when I rain down with pain
Cool with these ways of rhyme, at the drop of a dime
My niggas creepin' from behind,
Here's where I draw the line, you dare cross it
I think you lost it ya losing your mind, also your soul I control
Got ya tranced and confused, burnt, battered, and bruised
Simple minds get used when they snooze

"Break dat party, rip dat party"

[Wild Child]
Hahahah... my fantasy is to line MC's in chronological order
Tell 'em I'm mad at all of ya brothers, check out my strategy
The time shifter as I inflict this rhyme constructor,
You all are illusions so, peep out my mind state
My agenda is to round you up and cause mad friction
Take out you fiction MC's and then bring it back like treason
I'm talking realness, everyone's speaking hip hop, but can't feel this
I yield with my vibe cuz I'm insured like Blue Shield
I'm the Wild Child, I hear wack styles, time to get agile
I'll come back with thumbtacks cuz hip hop's mad fragile
And then I'll cause accidents, mind state of a chameleon
So I can come back and say Larry Parker got me one million
Now Lootpack and Declaime represent MC's
That'll set it off for Oxnard and my whole posse
Wild Child with the style that'll wreck your body,
I'm here to "Break dat party, rip dat party"

[Madlib]
Hey yo, niggas always trying to figure out what this style is
Cuz we go the extra milage cuz your lyrics skeptic so just forget it
It's Madlib the bad kid to bring the antiseptic
My chemical warfare letting off hydra right beside ya
Inside ya, it might ride ya
Off the atlas, out this atmos, rappers becomin' like actors, the fact is
You take a risk if you copy like a disk
You stand alone if you tryin' to be a clone
Rule number 4180
It ain't only the record companies that's shady
But they are a big part of this watered down art form
Till Lootpack release the storm wave
To ya commercial slaves
I engrave my name to show you who's to blame
For this '98 rain

[Declaime]
I'm Declaime running thangs, rock your whole body,
I'm gonna "Break dat party, Rip dat party"

[Wild Child]
Yo, I'm Wild Child with the style that'll wreck your body,
I'm here to "Break dat party, rip dat party"

[Madlib]
Yo, it's Madlib the beat conductor with the beat to take you under,
I'm gonna "Break dat party, rip dat party"

[All together]
It's Lootpack, Declaime, taking out wack MC's,
We're gonna "Break dat party, rip dat party"</pre>
