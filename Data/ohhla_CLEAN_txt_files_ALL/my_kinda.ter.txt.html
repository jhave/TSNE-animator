Boriqua, baby
Word up

[ Tony Sunshine singing ]
I know this girl
The bitch you fucked for free
As long as she knows that you're down
Then it's alright with me
So come on over
And run this train with me
We get her pissy drunk
And roll a dutch and blow some trees
But anticipate this
The girl is on some shit
I guarantee this bitch'll
Suck the skin right off your dick
She gon' make you squirt yo goods (squirt yo goods)
She gon' make it hurt real good (hurt real good)
She can make it last all night (last all night)
Hold that ass real tight
She gon' make you squirt yo goods (squirt yo goods)
She gon' make it hurt real good (hurt real good)
She can make it last all night (last all night)
Hold that ass real tight

And I know this girl
She'd bust a gun for me
And I'm about to send her
Out of town with half a ki
This bitch is crazy
But baby's crazy cute
She's known for packin a .38
Round her Daisy Dukes
She don't be creepin
Because she's down with me
She got my name tatooed
Across her chest as r&amp;b
Let's get his money
Now let's do it, twin
I got the product
You supply the grin
We chop it up, bag it up
Hit her with the raw
Terror Squad, now come on, baby
Let's get his money
Now let's do it, twin
I got the product
You supply the grin
We chop it up, bag it up
Hit her with the raw
Terror Squad, now come on, baby
She can make you cop a plead
She can make you drop to your knees
She can bust a gun all night
The bitch'll flip and fight
She can make you cop a plead
She can make you drop to your knees
She can bust a gun all night
The bitch'll flip and fight

[ Cuban Link ]
Yo, this shortie's naughty by nature
Always horny, runnin orgees for paper
Till we take her to my place and lace her with a few chasers
Make her scream for the team, me and you gon' break her
Shake'n bake her, we two players with more game than the Lakers
They can hate us all they want to, baby, it's the Bronx Zoo
Comin through to hump em down till they call us huncles
So what you gonna do when Big Tone and Cu
Run a triz on you, skip the singin, hit them with the 1-2

[ Tony Sunshine rapping ]
What up, boo, how are you, wanna troop with me?
Take you back to the crib, show you ecstacy
Sip Beck's with Hennessy, or maybe Alizé
We can jump in the shower and then we parlay
I roll the buddah sack, I hit you from the back
I make your booty clap, Terror Squad is true to that
We the cats who be layin em flat, breakin they back
Whether rappin or singin, I still be blazin the track
It's like that

[ Tony Sunshine singing ]
She gon' make you squirt yo goods (squirt yo goods)
She gon' make it hurt real good (hurt real good)
She can make it last all night (last all night)
Hold that ass real tight
She can make you cop a plead
She can make you drop to your knees
She can bust a gun all night
The bitch'll flip and fight</pre>
