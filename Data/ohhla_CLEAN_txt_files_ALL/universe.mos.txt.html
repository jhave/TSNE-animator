[Mos Def]
Yeah, ha ha ha
A-B-boys rock the world
CD's and tapes help generate papes
E-F is the important Def
G-good, H is what style be
When I grab the microphone and MC
Roll off the tongue like L-M-N-O-P
And when I am done you will agree
Mos Def represent most definitely
Jesus what I used to rock it in '83
Drank up all the Kool-Aid at the block party
Used to wish I could break the Rock Steady
Wash this be the brown shoe on TV
But now it's not dis and it's on like THIS
My name is Mos Def, this is good as it gets
Baby I make you rub your lips like sardines and grits
My what still hits even when the record skip
Even when the record skip
Even when the record skip
I don't quit, I don't quit
We bout to make this one a sure hit
Sean J. make the party people feel it

(Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to introduce a very
Interesting young man that has traveled from very far 
Away to be with us tonight)

[Mos Def]
Ha ha ha, what uh-huh
There is such a place, that creates such a melody BROOKLYN
No ladies it's a living dream, it's a living dream, it's a living dream
LOVE LIKE THIS
Recognize all area crew, whether you speak Japanese or Goony Goo Goo
Son when I come through, other rappers boo-hoo
Cuz they know they style's soft like baby doo-doo
I will continue, to hit like a fifth of stolen Naya
Puttin jokers on ice to get the cream like Breyer
No secret, Mos Def is the one that hunts a Mya
I get in my stance and set the dance on FIRE
Spread out my wings and I take the world HIGHER
Peace to the fam magnetic in the Chi
Job-on, top Sean and my man Ahtu
And all my other clan who reside in the Zoo
Got a celebrated oatmeal broadcast crew
Mos Def gon keep it naked like Um Fu-Fu (ANDY!!)
Put it here to the tape like crazy glue
So when they bounce out of speakers they stick to you
The way that I communicate is non-typical
But high level like a 3-D visual
I hold the mic extensive, exhibit level and dimension
I radiate the space like a up-right bass
Son I leave crews laced and escape wit no trace
Sound official like the finish time at a horse race
Here to put it in place, for the nine-uno-seis
Mos Def set the pace, make your fam give chase

Raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it
Universal Magnetic b-boy, scientific
It's like that and you don't stop
It goes onto the rhythm you don't stop
Raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it
The Universal Magnetic B-BOY, scientific y'all
You don't stop, it goes onto the rhythm bust it

Baby it's in my chromosomes to ROCK
Microphones sets who wanna test the M-O 
Best to leave that *nigga* alone
I make no bones or poems about droppin bars
I make the world full swing under the Mos Def YES
I ring the alarm like tennis sore
My style hella-raw, I keep it raw bone like Skeletor
And you should go and tell your clientele
That they need to get The Message like Melle Mel
I got the -- locked like a Death Row show
And if I ain't a b-boy, Premier never used a bell (ding ding)
So tell your boy, (what) crew to retire
Before I make they *ass* catch fire like Richard Pryor
Nondescriptive fiendin for riches, callin earths *bitches*
But most of y'all brothers is livin wit your mothers
Your Boogie Man yankin up your covers
Sharper than some new box cutters, on Parkay's and butters
And Stevie Wonder's, to make you run and tell the others
The beat lovers, and play my jam like the numbers
Son I rock the globe like I rocked your boat
I'm bout to tap it on your shoulder cuz you got to know

Now raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it
The Universal Magnetic b-boy, scientific
Like that, and you don't stop
It goes onto the rhythm you don't stop
And raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it
Universal Magnetic B-BOY, (hooo!!) scientific 
You don't stop, it goes onto the rhythm you don't stop
Raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it
Universal Magnetic b-boy, scientific
Like that, and you don't stop
It go onto the rhythm you don't stop
Now raise your hands in the air everybody get wit it
The Universal Magnetic in a b-boy stance</pre>
