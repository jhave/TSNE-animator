MR. I'ma shock the world
If you can't find your old lady
MR. I got your girl
MR. Versache wear
MR. I got you there
MR. infared
Where ever the dot go
MR. I'm gonna pop you there
MR., MR., MR. who I be
If you can't call me MR.
DON'T CALL ME!

[Chorus x3]
MR.
Call me what the fuck you want
MR.
As long as you got MR. in front

See I be quick with them hands
So you can call me
MR. handy man

MR. honey taker
MR. funeral director
Turn a nigga off
MR. under taker

Got girls from California like Oakdale
You might see me here
You might see me there
But I be in like two places
I be mugging
I be smiling
MR. like two faces
I got a house thats white
And D.C. ain't my resident
It's like I run the whole world
So I don't know why you call
MR. president
MR. like cocaine
MR. key but never dope
MR. if I had a drugstore be a pharmacist on the block
MR. dopeman
MR. like glock hood
If i was army

To my block
MR. black hole
MR. if you ain't got my money
MR. shop closed

[Chorus x3]

Bitch I ain't no boy man
I don't play with toys man
Unless you wanna count this AP 9 sitting up in my draws man
Take a pause man

How you know that shit nigga?
Ask your girl
Last night I was up in them draws man
MR. like tough that
MR. like rough neck
MR. break head boards fool

If your sac ain't fat fool

MR. Lexus
MR. diamond ring and necklace
MR. hoopties and wreckless
MR. like Bone
Bigger than Texas
Never no MR. peace keeper
Move like the MR. grimreaper
When I come looking for you
MR. heat seeker
And when I find you
MR. street sweeper

And when you see me
You best not be tripping
You bet it be Silkk
Or you best call me like MR.

[Chorus x2]
