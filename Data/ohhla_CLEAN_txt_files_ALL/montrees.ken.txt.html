[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, me and my niggas trying to get it, ya bish (ya bish)
Hit the house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish (ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (was persuasive)
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (ya bish)
Dreams of living life like rappers do (like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (wasn't cool)
I fucked Sherane then went to tell my bros (tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on (burn came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (ya bish)
Park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish (ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (see dollar signs)
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish (ya bish)
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish (ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (we never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue

[Chorus One: Kendrick Lamar]
It go Halle Berry, or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one, in front of the gun lives forever)
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel

[Chorus Two: Kendrick Lamar]
Nah, nah; a dollar might just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
Nah; a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
Nah, nah; a dollar might just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
Nah; a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel

[Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of living life like rappers do (like rappers do)
Bump that new E-40 after school (after school)
You know "Big Ballin' with my Homies" (my homies)
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational (thinking rational)
Back to reality we poor, ya bish (ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (ya bish)
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (Tony head)
He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish (ya bish)
That Louis Burger never be the same (be the same)
A Louis belt will never ease that pain (ease that pain)
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerking (day is jerking)
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirting (Pirelli's skirting)
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish)
Hoping all of em offend you, ya bish (ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (a pot of gold)
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Interlude 2X: Anna Wise]
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes? No way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No way

[Jay Rock]
Imagine Rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whippin', ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, everyday I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em, get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking, blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

[Chorus One]

[Outro/Skit]
"Kendrick, just bring my car back man. I called in for another appointment. 
I figured you weren't gonna be back here on time anyways. 
Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house man. this man, on one,
he feeling good as a motherfucker. Shit, I'm tryna get my thing going too
Just bring my car back. Shit, he faded. He feeling good. Look, listen to him."
"Girl, Girl, I want your body, I want your body, cause of that big ol' fat ass.
 Girl, Girl, I want your body, I want your body, cause of that big ol' fat ass."
"See, he high as hell, and he ain't even trippin' off them damn dominoes anymore.
 Just bring the car back." 
"Did somebody say dominoes?!"</pre>
