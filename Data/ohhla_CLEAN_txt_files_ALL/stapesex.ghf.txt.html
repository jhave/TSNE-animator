[Intro: girl]
Mmm, oh, ugh, put it in
Yeah

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
You can put my, dick in your mouth and play with my nuts
But before I bust, babe, I think I'll cum in your butt
I got my, gun on the floor and I'm ready to fuck
Like it's nothing, it's nothing

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo my, face is wet, got hair on my tongue
Cuz I'mma greedy nigga, absorb pussy juice like a sponge
Feel the pretty warm dick, rub it on your clit
Oh, right before I bust, I spray it on your tits
Switch you over, throw you to the side with one leg up
See the head slide in your hole, he stay up
Dick all shiny, helmet head bulging, smack it on your tooshie
When I hear the *click*click* it's wet and it's gooshy
From behind, I'm a master mind, hundred fast ones
And slow it up, because I know how to fuck
Keep your pussy right there, don't move, ooh
Holla at your boy, baby, do what it do
I love fucking you, your pussy's the bomb (yeah)
Think about fucking this shit all day when I'm gone
Get up, suck that dick, spit on it, slob on that shit
More bubbles at the knob of that shit
It's my word, you'se a whore, taste good, right?
Turn around, get on all four
(You pulling my hair) Shut the fuck up
(Why you fucking me like that?) Shut the fuck up
This ain't no R&amp;B dick, this hood
My slow jam dick is on Thursday's, if my sugar high
My dick don't get up, you know I'm the best
Just, shut your mouth up like you under arrest
I'm ready to cum (you ready to cum)
Yeah, keep it right (oh my gosh, my pussy is numb)
OK, just rub it up against your hole
Put your thumb in your mouth, and fuck me real slow
Look at me, yeah, baby, I'mma let that go
Tell me you love me (I love you, baby) Oh oh

[Outro: Ghostface Killah (girl)]
Oh shit, don't touch me, don't touch me
I said don't touch me, chill
Let me get a cigarette (you don't smoke, nigga)
Oh yeah, I forgot (haha) I love when you fuck me like that
I'mma go put up some work at the studio, though
But when I get back, have a little nurse outfit on
With the hat to the side, so I can bend you over
In that little desk we got in the room
In your thigh highs, word up, and I'mma stop at the Adell store
And get one of them little screaming O's
So you can sit your little clit on it and just
Let it buzz off all day (yeah) Knowhatimsaying, ma?
I'mma get the nine and move</pre>
