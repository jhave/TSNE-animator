[The JBeez, the JBeez...]

10th round,
And still catching that beat down
So I retreat back to my old stomping ground,
Regroup and lounge,
Put on a couple of pounds,
And make plans to create the raw, homegrown sounds
Without love and support,
I might come up short,
But I dare not resort, to the low-life sport
Young bucks nowadays,
Even kids my own age,
Making front page
By getting locked in the cage
Pumping, self-destruction
And self-reduction
Souls get sucked into the evil corruption
The odds are against me
And the world won't present to me
Bad thoughts on my mind
But I won't let it tempt me
Organized confusion, negative illusion
I throw up my guard to combat intrusion

Say what say what say what

Cuz I'm a Jungle Brother [Jungle Brother]
True Blue [True Blue]
Cuz I'm a Jungle Brother [Jungle Brother]
True Blue [True Blue]
 
Cuz I'm a Jungle Brother [Jungle Brother]
True Blue [True Blue]
Cuz I'm a Jungle Brother [Jungle Brother]
True Blue [True Blue]
 

Now if I worry to much about all my have nots
I might not recoginize just what I've got
I've got control of my soul and I gotta firm hold
And if I keep on holding, I'ma reach my goals
When I'm walking through the streets
I see all sorts, BIG wasn't lying about them drugs and sports
Gotta keep my head up and everything is alright
Cuz if I want to get this cash, I got to be game tight
Baby girl is at home and she's screaming "Daddy"
Momma don't know, just might think I'm out pimping in a nice caddy,
But it ain't like that
Trying to keep that rogue status up off my back
So when the loot come through,
I do what I gotta do,
Cuz indeed I'm Jungle Brother, just to stay true blue.

Cuz I'm a Jungle Brother [Jungle Brother]
True Blue [True Blue]
Cuz I'm a Jungle Brother [Jungle Brother]
True Blue [True Blue]
 
Cuz I'm a Jungle Brother [Jungle Brother]
True Blue [True Blue]
Cuz I'm a Jungle Brother [Jungle Brother]
True Blue [True Blue]
 
[The JBeez, The JBeez...]

Ya
For all my peoples out there, in the NYC
JBeez is the initial, got to keep it official,
Ripping up the game plan, and send it off like a missile
Business is intact, now we come back strapped
So if something go down, we rearrange contracts
Coming bite and exact
To take your mental out the shack
Dunk your cookie in my milk 
And let it soak in my rap
On the mic I talk about the blight
To reach new heights 
Put up a fight with everything in sight
That blocks my light
Label my generation 
X marks the spot
We make it hot
We don't stop
To bust back, we just keep
Busting the [Blam blam]
Bulletproof brain cells
The name spells out success
That will remind you of the place where the JBeez rest

Stay black and rhyming
Till the day that I'm dieing
Death defying
Shaky eyeing
And God I'm relying
Test up my import, make a million or more
Keep the radio rocking, fill up the dance floor
When we come to the jam
No glissening gimmicks
Break it off on your right
See my style has no limits
Handle BI like a true blue jungle GI
Make the ladies reply with the wink of an eye
Rhyme writing, counter lighting
Emcees like this make hits for competition
Like slitting your wrists
Each sequel's so lethal
That no other can equal
Spark it up for the jam
But rock it on for the people

Cuz I'm a Jungle Brother [Jungle Brother]
True Blue [True Blue]
Cuz I'm a Jungle Brother [Jungle Brother]
True Blue [True Blue]

Cuz I'm a Jungle Brother [Jungle Brother]
True Blue [True Blue]
Cuz I'm a Jungle Brother [Jungle Brother]
True Blue [True Blue]
 
Every day, all day, it goes down like this
