(Fiend)
Now now what's happing lil mama

Dicking my boys in the romans of Cali corn
Don't want the position of wifie on my arm (straight

High fiven and give it clappin
Get freaky as you wanna be

What I don't know
They don't wanna tramp to be an hoe
Keep it on the down low
Long you bringing that paper for show
Ahh, Ahh know
What you call secrets
Who day freaking, silly source cause they be leaking
Primetime open the curtains 
Let your lights shine
You blowin dick 
Like you having a nice time
Gobble Gobble thanks is giving 
She just swallowed
Drunk so much  splash
Your throat is hallow
Show your ass since 12
You been hella fast
Gone off that drank, marijuna, and hash
I'm glad that bash( show was an nice fuck)
But I wanted to last
