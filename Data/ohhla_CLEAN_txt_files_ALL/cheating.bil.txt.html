[Hook]
You were cheating
See your services, I don't need no mo'
You were cheating
Get your grip get your hat, get your coat you gotta go

[D-Block]
You a cheater, come on how could this be
My best friend, the one who was close to me
Keeping me company, you was right by my side
You my Bonnie I'm your Clyde, tight that's how we ride
We were in fine tune, like a big ben clock
Like Ashford and Simpson, we were solid as a rock
Everything must stop, but why did it have to be
My relationship with you, when you promised to keep it true
How could you, do this though
Build up enough confidence, to stoop so low
It's crazy yo, I guess the myth is true
That some girls just do what they do, but who knew
It would be you, I guess that's how it goes
I fell for a witch, and she closed I'm supposed
You think I'm gonna, take you back
Here's your coat your grip and your hat, get to stepping girl gon back

[Hook]
You were cheating
See your services, I don't need no mo'
You were cheating
Get your grip get your hat, get your coat you gotta go
You were cheating
See your services, I don't need no mo'
See your ass, is out of line
Now you gotta, ride the pine

[D-Block]
Now you all cried out, and wonder if my feelings have changed
Hell naw, they remain the same
And who's to blame, couldn't keep your hands to yourself
To busy creeping on the down low, loving somebody else
Come get your britches off my shelf, and bring my key
My ring, and everything else that belongs to me
See I'm throwing you the deuce, you can kiss my caboose
Keep on trying to holla girl, but there's no use
This here ain't bout to leave the states, and you get left behind
Only picking up one passenger, and you second in line
Erase you out my mind, what love there was was gone
I'm not trying to be too rude, but it's a must you move on
So so long, siarnora adios
Vamoos, holla at ya girl get ghost
You just lost the most important thang to ya, and it was me
Enough with all that, cause what we had is now history

[Billy Cook]
And you got a problem girl, you need to change
Bouncing up and down like you happy to see a nigga, smiling right in my face
But game reck and nice games, that's why I'm switching lanes
Now your ass is lucky to cold fo' at the bus stop, standing in the rain so fuck you

[D-Block]
You could ride the pine, catching splinters in your butt
Thought I had a star player, but even the best get cut
Now what, you all alone looking stupid
Last arrow didn't work, now you searching for cupid
Look what you did, you need to change your ways
Get yourself together, quit running all them plays
This is not a game, quit acting like a quarterback
Tried to get too sneaky, messed around and got sacked
Smacked real hard, now you out the game
Missed a good chance, of walking down the isle of fame
Sharing my last name, giving birth to my seed
All because of one thing, and it had to be greed
That was a need, to go looking for love
When I have so much love right here, thought I had made that clear
I guess the feelings in me, weren't even on your mind
And that's the very reason, that your ass is riding the pine
