Song:   Organic Electricity
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[uncredited spoken word poets form the song's intro]
    "After a week of smoky nothingness.."
    {*voice SLOWED down*} ".. the stars had returned"
"The mountains were blue now, and purple along the upper reaches"
{*SLOWED again*} "And as the sun left off,
 the moon took up her reign over the true blue spaces."
    "It was very solemn."

[Aceyalone]
As I stand in place, as the center of my galaxy
I AM, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY
My eyelids expose - the circumfrence
My mind tends to bend - irreverant!
Unparalleled - chaotic!
My fairy tale - psychotic
Lifespan - infinity
I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY
Equality and harmony - transmit
Contact shockwave - I'M HIT!
Program exchange - compute
Reformat hard drive - comply
Quantum leap time travel - exist
Exiting the exodus - connect
Brainchild nucleus - reality
I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY
All that has ever been - I shall be
And all that will come to be - I will become
God word radiate - authenticity
I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY

Cocooned in ignorance, silence and darkness
Blessed with intelligence, keenness and sharpness
to explore the seamless dreamless nightmarish illusion
Enhanced by your perception but, no conclusion

Mainframe access - DENIED
Password G.O.D. - supplied
Universal guidance - odyssey
I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY
Divining at the power source - intensity
I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY
Beauty of the inner pain - experience
Struggle of the forces - serious
Stargate pathway - enlightened
Thought process - engaged

Completing composition but imperfect intuition
I orbit in position, gravitational suspension
Past the 3rd and 4th and 5th dimensions
The extensions of, the pieces of, the essence of this power
And carve the earth, mountains, land and seas
Rivers, lakes and valleys, and deserts
YOUR EYES'LL NEVER HOLD IT ALL AT ONCE - just the small pleasures
My everlasting backspin, around the solar system-atic
AUTOMATIC CONTROLLER, fold in place by space and time
Tear down the walls of nothing
WE ARE ALL FULL OF INDIVIDUALS AND INDEPENDENCIES
CAUSE I AM, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY

As I sit in place, as the center of my galaxy
I AM, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY
My eyelids extends - the circumfrence
My mind tends to bend - irreverant!
Unparalleled - chaotic!
My fairy tale - psychotic
Lifespan - infinity
I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY
Equality and harmony - transmit
Contact shockwave - I'M HIT!
Program exchange - compute
Reformat hard drive - comply
Quantum leap time travel - exist
Exit to the exodus - connect
Brainchild nucleus - reality
I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY
All that has ever been - I shall be
And all that will come to be - I will become
God word radiate - authenticity
I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY</pre>
