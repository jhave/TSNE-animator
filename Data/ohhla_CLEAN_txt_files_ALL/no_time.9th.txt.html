[Rapper Big Pooh - Intro]
Yeah, yeah
YEAH, WHA
RAPPER! Uh, Phonte
Mr. Dream Merchant, yeah!
Uh, I know you see me
Yeah, I know you hear me
Sh'yo, I know you fear me
Listen, sh'yo...

[Rapper Big Pooh]
My pen packin a venom, heart pumpin the sound
Ma, I'm pimpin the system, my catalogue is the hound
Got a problem we air 'em, intellegent and I scare 'em
Beat knockin they hear 'em, why in earth did they pair 'em?
Niggaz spittin that fiction, addicted to my diction
Wanna know what I'm fixin, try peepin the kitchen
What the game's been missin, not a thing if you ask
 Been here for years, you decided to pass

[Phonte]
Uh, I'm here wit Pooh in the lab, Khrysis on the boards
Still spittin all the real shit the ladies adore
When he come in the door, all eyes on moi
Frustrated cause they cain't believe we came so far
Butt dick ridin niggaz, it's a big faux pas
Niggaz axein Pooh like, "'ey, is that 'cho car?"
But I tell 'em to chill, let my niggaz just breathe
cause by that look on your face, you got your heart on your sleeves

[Chorus: Rapper Big Pooh] (Phonte)
Yo, it's time to live, and a time to die
It's a time to laugh and it's a time to cry
It's a time to break, and it's a time to build
But no time to waste, no time to chill
Yo, it's time to live, and a time to die (Cause it's the real....)
It's a time to laugh and it's a time to cry (Hip-hop, hip-hop....)
It's a time to break, and it's a time to build
But no time to waste, no time to chill


Fo' REAL (fo' REAL), fo' REAL (fo' REAL)
Fo' REAL (fo' REAL), fo' REAL (fo' REAL)

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I decided to stand, it's all a part of the plan
Broke free from the suits, no longer part of the scam
Cause you called it a FLIM, but you part of the flam
They like, "Pooh, you fo' real?" Muh'fuckers I am
Cause I mean what I say, and I say what I mean
You either right or you wrong, it ain't no "in between"
There's no 'us' in machine, still gettin that cream
Still makin a record, still livin a dream

[Phonte]
I'm still in your magazines, all your Vibes and Billboards
Still got the hater niggaz sayin they still bored
Still got the real niggaz sayin, "He still raw"
and still goin places that you niggaz would kill for
This rap shit is natural to me, dawg it's like breathin
It's like candy to a baby, dawg it's like teethin
It's like all you niggaz crazy, you are not even
on this level, homie stop dreamin!
Fo' REAL! (Fo' REAL!), Fo' REAL! (Fo' REAL!)
Fo' REAL! (Fo' REAL!), Fo' REAL! (Fo' REAL!)

[Chorus]


[Phonte - Outro]
(Cause it's the real...) Let the windows down, niggaz
Let them down...(Hip-hop, hip-hop....)
Let the windows down, I promise it's gon' sound better...
Let it GO...</pre>
