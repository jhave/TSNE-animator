Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Cage]
Hands under his little armpits holding him up
Squeezing him tight unaware of what's growing in his guts
Two feet tall, he can run and fall in his diaper
Hitting himself in the head with his father's lighter
Watching in disgust, it cries, he tries to ignore it
What nature had intended for now would ruin his courtship
The girl has a kid, the girl won't abort it
This empty vessel adoring, you filled it with pure shit
Mostly from resentment or perhaps he was neglected
Now has the fever in his arms and they were black and infected
When they spoke, they told him leave the girl and kid for dead
So he picked him up with one hand, held him up and said

[Chorus: Red Bank Kids Choir]
That you were not supposed to be inside her
Listen now you have a life and a brain
No wait, you had two strokes, you were going to die sir
Now would you kindly move out of our way?
Beat kids, beat kids, we keep shoveling sheep shit
Line us up, we don't believe it
But while we sleep they count sheep

[Verse 2: Cage]
Don't know how she made it but she's amazed that she did
Come fifteen years with no help, she had raised a kid
A couple marriages later this is the last one
The wedding band on his hand balled up and he blasts his son
Doesn't wanna know where all his bruises are from
She takes her husband's side and this just confuses him
Tragic, the magic of fertility, the ability to have another child
While one rots in a facility
Desperate to be happy but something stalled her heart
Unable to see a future with him and it falls apart
She sleeps on the couch, she puts food in her mouth
Loses her girlish figure, he figures this is his way out
She packs up and leaves with her daughters, in need of help
Violent streak, he's so abusive, just knows that there's someone else
Returns to get some things, he throws her to bed, she starts to brace
Smacks her, hold her down and has his way

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Red Bank Kids Choir]
And as he forces himself inside her
Her eyes dart around with pain
He says, "You can talk but no one listens to liars."
But you will surely get yours one day
Beat kids, beat kids, we keep funneling sheep shit
Line us up, we don't believe it
But when we sleep they beat kids
Beat kids, we keep shoveling sheep shit
Line us up, we don't believe it
But when we sleep they beat kids
Beat kids, we keep shoveling sheep shit
Line us up, we don't believe it
But when we sleep they count sheep</pre>
