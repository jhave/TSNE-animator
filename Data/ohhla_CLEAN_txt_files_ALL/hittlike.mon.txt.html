[Intro: Chanel West Coast]
Chanel, and Shanell, y'all already know
I told him I wanna know, where ya are

[Shanell]
Bet you want to know what it feel it like?
What it smell like? So good you what to call it your own
Take me out the hood, put me in the hills
Giuseppe huh? You like that huh? Cause I go along
It don't matter who you are who you are turn it up
Pass the caviar, dinin' in, come and get it (come and get it)
Hey-yeeeahh, he want it 7 days a week cause I give him what he needs

[Chorus: Shanell]
Cause he's always thinkin' about my body, ohh
Runnin' tellin' everybody, damn
Got him so gone, g-g-gone
Can't nobody turn him on, o-o-on
Cause he know what its hittin' like
He know what its hittin' like, hittin' like - ohh!
What it's hittin' like
He know what its hittin' like, hittin' like - ohh!

[Chanel West Coast]
Hittin' like, hittin' like
Hittin' like, hittin' like
Young Money, W-W-W-West Coast

Nobody like me, do him better (uh-uh)
Love the way I'm hittin' -- Mayweather (eyyy)
I'mma heat it up, wool sweater
Watch you beat it up, you better
Talkin' 'bout his biz he want to air it out
I'mma show you what it is when I wear him out
Agent provocative, satin sheets
Got him wantin' more mad that we got to pass

[Chorus]

[Shanell - repeat 2X]
My, love, be hit-tin' right
I'll, send, him to his crazy
My, love, be rock-in' like
He, want, to make me his lady
