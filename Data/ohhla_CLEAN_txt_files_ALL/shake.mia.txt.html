Mommamia
Momma got sum education fo ya young ass shakers
If its on his mind make him mash dat wit sum cash
Fakers stay up in da club try ta speak dat weak game
Dont be tryin to show no luv
Nigga fuck your pocket change
See its a new day and a new situation
Started off flashing 20's in your safe combination
Same nigga dats livin dat ballin life
Could be dat same nigga dat make a lap dance of his wife
Keep your combo tight
And every line so smooth
[voice]
Den why u dancin den?
Im payin my way through school
A golden gurl smile
Maken dem ends and I
Fuck around and get a doctor or a lawyer tunite
High maintenence bitches
Make tha world go round
But we'll go down and suck tha life up outta that thang
Fo sho now
Have yo ho while
This lightened touch gon make u melt
Cuz we dancin fo tha benjamins and fuckn fo tha Roosevelts

[Mia X]
Candy colored G-strings Gon keep da big willies hard
38 double d's got em screamin good lord
Money waivin everywhere
Gun smoke in the air
Hennesy and absolute got em wantin to go dere
Some of deze niggas gon call us hoes
But most of deze niggas gon tip us mo
Some of deze niggas gon play dat role
But all of deze niggas is good to go
Hold ya hand through tha club till tha curtains close
Been down for dis private dancin since dey opened tha door
Dont you like tha way I move
Yeah I see u startin to sweat
Thank u boo your time is up
Leavin wit his pants wet
Aint no shame in my game
Whatchu tryin to do
I bet I leave this motherfucker
Wit mo cheese den u
Push a e thats paid fo
Got a condo 2
And all dem hoes dats talkin shit
Wish dey could where my shoes
