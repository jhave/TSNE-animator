(x4)
Ouija, are you with me?
Mo murda, mo murda, mo murda me now

(x2)
Dear Mr. Ouija
Could you please tell me my future?
Will I die of murder? Will I die of bloody murder?
Come, come again

Will I die of bloody murder mo, bloody murder mo
bloody murder mo, bloody murder mo

(x2)
Tell me, will I die of murder mo?
(bloody murder mo, bloody murder mo
bloody murder mo)

Ouija, are you with me?
(bloody murder mo, bloody murder mo
bloody murder mo, bloody murder mo)

Tell me, Ouija, are you with me?
(bloody murder mo, bloody murder mo
bloody murder mo)

I'm here. I'm here. Are you with me?
(bloody murder mo, bloody murder mo
bloody murder mo, bloody murder mo)

I'm here. I'm here
(bloody murder mo, bloody murder mo)</pre>
