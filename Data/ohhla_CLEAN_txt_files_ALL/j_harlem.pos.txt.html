[ Shaheed the Poster Boy ]

Poster Boy.. Yeah
Harlem World.. I'm here baby!
First avail, this ones for the block..

I'm just sitting in the coupe bumping Jay to the Izzo
Going up to Brance and I'm trying to get the drizzo, you know
Straight out the gates, twenty for the shizzle
Drop a hundred G's and take her for the klizzo
I'm wild like them MA's sitting on death rizzo
And see the same dude from Freestyle Friday for shizzo
Negro, 20's on my bicycle
I'm the second coming, cock-sucker I'm official
Sixteen's is hot, from the mouth or the pistol
Keep the silencer from my gun so it whistles
Holler at ya boy if you want your song tighter
I'm the best new artist, and the best songwriter
Don't care if you ghetto or sophisticated
From the east to the West, im anticipated
Play your part before the nine come out
Niggaz is cool, they be nice, around the time Shyne come out
I was a regular nigga, before I bounced to stardom
I'm the reason all the tourists, bounce to Harlem
So it got to be Poster, live la vida loca
Money, hoes, cars, chocha
Ma sees the five and she run right to it
All she gets is hard dick, and some white fluid
BET put me out for real
The first nigga who ripped the basement, without a deal
Let's Go!!!

[ Hook ]
Yeah.. I'm gon' change the menu on this one
You know, turning things
Put it in fifth gear, so everybody listening, to ride with me

My name is Poster! Poster! I'm a rider
Similar to Destiny's Child I'm a survivor
Jump in the five troy, the designated driver
(Rollin!!) Sticky icky, an easy wider
Still on the block making a stack
Ten hollows in the nine, keep hating the mack
And you know I aint taking a gat
If the cops pull us over, the chauffer is taking the rap
We gangster! Nigga I don't run to the south
My 16's move the crowd, from the gun to the mouth
Poster, see money from diesel
Can't sit on the rims, unless they over 21 and legal
I'm the same nigga 106 &amp; Park retired
Smack the world with more hits than Mark McGwire
How you think I stay fly? In them different vasses?
When I copped 5 Benzes, all different classes
Shaheed play hoes like, music chairs
Only if they suck dick and swallow pubic hairs
So, get it right before you get it wrong
It's too bad me and haters don't get along
Already three albums done
I'm a change the game and go three, off of volume one
I don't know how the public will feel
I ain't even signed yet, about to close up a publishing deal</pre>
