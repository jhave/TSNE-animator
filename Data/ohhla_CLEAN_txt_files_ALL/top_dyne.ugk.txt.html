Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town

[Chorus]
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town (swangin on fo's)
Top drop down, top top drop down
Top top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town
Top drop down when I'm ridin through the town (swangin-swangin on fo's)
Top drop down, top top drop down
Top top drop down when I'm ridin through the town

[Pimp C]
When the top starts fallin the bitches start callin
My trunk start bangin and the fo's start crawlin
The drank mixed up, in the cream soda bottle
Her lips, hit my dick that's why I smashed on the throttle
Swisha Sweet candy, Robert Davis in my cup
I'm swervin like Bootsy but I couldn't give a fuck (fuck)
You see this car? (You see this car?) 
You see this truck? (You see this truck?)
They both for me now watch them girls get buck (buck)
Ain't shit friendly but we still have fun (fun)
UGK for life, you know the Pimp and the Bun (Bun)
The great state of Texas, candy in the Lexus
Dick for them hoes jaws, pistols for the flexers
Somebody asked me why I'm ridin on the East
All I did was told the truth, the bullshit niggaz cease (cease)
If you ain't hatin nigga why the fuck you mad?
If your records ain't sellin, get your fingers out ya ass, bitch!

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
Well it's the king of the trill (trill) wood wheel in my palm (palm)
Yeah I'm sittin sideways on suedes smokin that bomb (bomb)
The granddaddy kush mixed with a little O.G. (fo' sho')
That's my breakfast, off top I gotta blow three
Not to mention codeine, liquid and the pill (pill)
Bloats on my grill with my hand on my steel (steel)
Just another day in the life of a King
So while the candy paint drip, and the Cadillac swing
I'ma gon' and pop the trunk, surely but slowly
Let you see my name in lights, just so you know me
I'm gettin more points than Kobe, for my G-ness
Regardless of who's comin after me you gon' see list
Rims ain't big enough, paint don't glisten
And your trunk don't even rattle from your garbage ass system (no)
Your slab ain't holdin, ain't no use to you frontin
And I'm fin' to shut the game down when I push the button
And the.. {*echoes*}

[Chorus]

[Cory Mo]
Swangin on fo's nigga, uhh
Back on the slab for the first time, I'm full of that purp' nine
Boys mad at me cause I know what I'm worth now
Droppin them tops down, beatin the blocks down
Leavin 'em with they mouth wide, stuck at the stop sign
Blow-Pop candy paint glistenin off my panky rang
Listenin to some old school Underground Kiiiiingz
So you know I'm sittin on swaaaaang
Cory Mo about to do the damn thaaaaang
In the butter guts with the diamond in the back
King Kongs in the trunk, hit the switch and watch it crack
I'ma let my paper stack and quote nothin but facts
So don't "ax" me nothin partner 'less you droppin some cash (cash)
Now she hoppin it fast (fast) that's just how I like it (like it)
Turn around and show me somethin girl I'm gettin excited (oooh)
Ain't nobody trippin cause the money already made
I done said it befo', so I'ma say it again
And let my top drop dowwwwwn
