[Intro - Chamillionaire]
I'm lookin in my rearview
And I can see a clearer view of you
This is the remix...
I see you waitin, I know you hatin...

[Chorus - Akon]
I see them watchin, they waitin
For an opportunity to ride up on me
Hopin they don't roll up on me
Cause today I'm ridin dirty
And if they stop me I might be goin to jail tonight

[Chamillionaire]
Ch-Chea! Chamillitary mayne... uh, yeah
I got 20 grand in my pocket and, I'm ridin around with my pockets crammed
You the one that got the contraband, and you smokin that like you in Amsterdam
Before I know it, I see them sirens, I'm pullin over - aye, we just ridin!
Don't talk back, won't be no violence, just shut up, and sit in your seat in silence
Now the police is searchin who? They searchin me and then they searchin you
They smell the breeze and you smell like trees
cause you hit the blunt and hit the purple too
Now the lie is irreversable because you just told 'em we were ridin clean
They question you, but they ain't question me yet
I'm thinkin the police ain't find a thing
Standin on the side of the freeway, wishin they would just hurry up
And I can see, you walkin up to me, like he about to put me up in them cuffs
I turned around and I look at you, and you look away like you feelin sick
I'm goin to jail for what I didn't comit, I must admit, that I hate a snitch

[Chorus - Akon (Chamillionaire)]
I see them watchin, they waitin
For an opportunity to ride up on me
Hopin they don't roll up on me
Cause today I'm ridin dirty (Cause I'm ridin dirty)
And if they stop me I might be goin to jail tonight (jail tonight)

[Chamillionaire]
Ever since they heard the song ridin dirty
The whole world been listenin I'm glad you heard me
Some cops that representin the badge
been showin me every cop ain't bad or tryin to scurr me
A year after "White and Nerdy"
On the grind, still tryin, still flyin birdies
That stuff still in ya cup, still drivin swervin
Ridin dirty like the vehicle inside the derby
A little inspired by U.G.K, and the rest inspired by the life I'm livin
Seen that Impala, he was drunk
And that's when I saw the red lights go get em
And it's ironic that during the chase
Seen Murder Chase, and this kid was Christian
Movin target ran across the street
And unfortunately the car didn't miss him
And now the family is soon to know, that they gon have to do another funeral
The angels ain't singin to ya tune no more, don't move too fast, baby move it slow
Cause one day ya here, baby... next thing ya know, next thing ya know
Everything that used to move don't move no more

[Chorus - Akon]
I see them watchin, they waitin
For an opportunity to ride up on me
Hopin they don't roll up on me
Cause today I'm ridin dirty
And if they stop me I might be goin to jail tonight

[Outro - Chamillionaire]
This is not a movie, it's real life, yeah, yeah...
It's real life, it ain't just a song, it's a message
Nobody ever opens they eyes till somebody gets killed
Rest in peace to Sean Bale
