[Mistah F.A.B.]
Ha hahhh~! Too $hort
This one of them new thangs, mayne
Some of that thang, that thang, knahmtalkinabout?
Trax Music, look

This what it is, never been nothin more
Any time I hit the bar, believe I'm gon' score
I got me a chick, believe she gon' whore
I'm original, never seen me before
Let's roll, roll wherever you want to
Eye to eye, what'chu wan' do
I'm pimp to the Bay, ask the king himself
$hort look at me, hey see yourself
So I dosey-doe, and then I hop around
I shake and bounce, and then I rep the town
This is for the kids in the scrapers with doors up
Dreads in they head, got the lean in the cup
Top of the car and they hit the gear
Hop out of the car and they pop the thizz
THIZZ?~! Oh yeah, thizz what it is
If you from the Bay then do it like this

[Chorus]
Turf dance, turf dance, air walk, air walk
Ghost ride, ghost ride, pimp talk, pimp talk
That thang - do it, do it! That thang - do it, do it!
That thang - do it, do it! That thang - so fast!

[Mistah F.A.B.]
In the club, this is where I do what I do
Thizz face on like I smell doo-doo
I don't need no clique, I'll dance for me
Feelin myself like D-R-E
What is it?~! I know you see it
Look at look at me, I know you wanna be it
MISTAH FAB, OH MY GOD YOU'RE GREAT
I LOVE YOUR SONGS, I BOUGHT YOUR TAPE!!!
Thank you very much, I appreciated it
Get on the yellow bus and procede to scrape it
Dip and yoke it, roll it, smoke it
Hit the sideshow while you goin through Oakland
WHEE! Start yellin out WHEE!
WHile you at it, throw up that T
T, what's that for? Thizz!
I already told you, it is what it is

[Chorus]

[Mistah F.A.B.]
Rollin down the street smokin purple
Sippin on Grey Goose
Fin' to do the fool!
Like a kid in June when he gettin out of school
Turf dancin, in the middle of the street
Ghostbusters - they the police
Rippers, they prove to bangers
You ain't gotta trip, whole crew can bang up
Sliders, they expensive scrapers
Stunners, have you lookin like Darth Vader
On like shit, that mean you high
Wet you, bet that mean you fly
Fast, that mean so quick
A.O.B., that's all on a bitch
When you come to the Bay this how we speak
And turf, that mean yo' street

[Chorus]</pre>
