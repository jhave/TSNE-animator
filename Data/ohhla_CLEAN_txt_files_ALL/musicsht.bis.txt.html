[Verse One]
How many hip hop niggas you know is so gangsta but ain't one
Bump +Planet Rock+ and got a handgun
I used to break dance now they dance like they break somethin'
Me? I'm just me, industry niggas stay frontin'
I was born in '78
Watched crack kill the 80's, bought my first rap tape
Could been Life Is or We Want Eazy
I never heard a motherfucker talk so greezy
Used to sneak and bump the tape when my momma would leave
11 cussin' like motherfuck, you wouldn't believe
My brother bumped Guy, it was some real fly shit
Especially +Piece Of My Love+ when Aaron said "Dumb bitch"
Had the Fila's and the Lottos with my Lee jeans on
Playin' That's My Car till the lights came on
Friday night's, pump it up then watched The Box
Same time 'round the corner, little homie got shot

[Chorus] [x2]
Yeah
This music shit saved my life
Coulda did wrong but I was tryin' to write
A lot of homies dead and gone or they facin' life
For tryin' to hold them thangs while I was holdin' a mic

[Verse Two]
How many hip hop niggas you know that's so gangsta but ain't one
Bumped Das EFX and got a handgun
I used to rock a Gumby round shirt with big pants on
Step up in the house party, finna get my dance on
+Ice Ice Baby+ through the speakers was thumpin'
Niggas diss it now, but back then it was bumpin'
My momma and this music shit is all that I had
Growin' up through a divorce my brother move with our dad
And
Due to not havin' a dime
We'd have to move at least about five more times
From Inglewood to S.C., Bueno Park to M.V.
We picked up and moved so much I felt like a gypsy
Bueno Park is where the bullshit would start
Racism let me know what it means to be dark
Fightin' everyday on the way to school
Cause X-Clan and Chuck D told me, "Fight them fools"

[Chorus] [x2]
Yeah
This music shit saved my life
Coulda did wrong but I was tryin' to write
A lot of homies dead and gone or they facin' life
For tryin' to hold them thangs while I was holdin' a mic

[Verse Three]
How many hip hop niggas you know that's so gangsta but...
Awe fuck it, let me get to the point
Morena Valley, dippin' bikes, might share floor space
Poppin' wheelies, hit a ditch, fucked up my face
Flash forward, finally we got to move back
With my granny in the Pueblos with the roaches and the rats
Come closer, I hope I ain't lost ya
For fun I used to make 'em scatter out the dish washer
Moved to Compton, that's when I heard Quik
Beefin' with Eiht on +Dollars &amp; Sense+
Death Row was poppin'
Snoop Dogg was rockin'
West coast dominatin', everybody was jockin'
Hooked up with Lee and the Hub City Committee
My nigga John John and Joey taught me to get busy
Around the same time my homeboys started to bang
Thank God, Silicone put me on to Wu-Tang

[Chorus] [x2]
Yeah
This music shit saved my life
Coulda did wrong but I was tryin' to write
A lot of homies dead and gone or they facin' life
For tryin' to hold them thangs while I was holdin' a mic</pre>
