Re Re Re Mix

[Chorus]
We do it all for the
Stage lights
Oooooooooooo oooooooooo oooooooooo ooooooooooooo oooooo
Just for the
Stage light

[Verse 1]
Yeah and we got that trunk music yep
Lincoln continental rumbilin shit is over yep
So did you over shlep
Over sleep bonus that ghetto visions a boulder yep
Drunk motherfucker I need to take me a sober rest
Fuck it give me the whiskey bottle and throw the rest in the trunk
And let the 808 hit the shoulder net
Row the best do it screw it hold it in hold it chest hold it up
Yelawolf got the shit make you come for ritz
He control the deck
Smoking ciggarettes
Rollin Chevrolets on the start killing shit from LA to bouldercrest
So you need a break and for the rest
Fuck you turn blue hold your breath
Call a penalty into me going shoulder ref
We winning anyway homie you must be going deaf
You know we going left field and we grow the best skill cut it down from the goal so you can hold the net
If you ball in the grow a set show a check
If you wanna win fit us in in the Rolodex
Hater why you looking so depressed
Excuse me I got a show to wreak
And its back to the

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I put a dent in that rental buddy back to the fender
Sack a track I'm back I'm bagging sacks of this timber
Come get you some
Ricky go ricky bobby here ricky comes
Sportin a hicky from hicky chick-ies who give me some
Rolling the sicky stick give ricky the sticky thumb thumbs up
Pull up to the party with fifty some bucks
Driking not trippin cum fuck
Wit a born hippie done crump
I get rythym like a hippie drum son
I'm from the bottom believe it people the freedom eagle
Americas inhaling the bible pale when I feed um
All I wanted was to lead them to the light and see um
Now all I'm living under the lights of every colusium

[Chorus]</pre>
