[Intro: Sample from an interview with Notorious B.I.G.]
'Cause I know how niggas is when you in the streets and you hustlin you know how niggas is
'Cause you was one of them niggas you know what I'm sayin?
You on the corner and tryin to get your money you see a nigga rollin a ride a benz or a beamer
You be like fuck that nigga youknow what I'm sayin? 
'Cause I'll, I'll murder that nigga I'll rob that nigga you know what I'm sayin?
Now I'm the nigga in the benz and the beamer you know what I'm sayin?
Drivin that other corner so I know the same speeches comin up you know what I'm sayin?
It's all good though, I ain't trippin, I'm that nigga

[Verse One: Fabolous]
I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a fuck
Rather hold my head high and die, than live and duck
'Member I was down to die just to live it up
But life's a bitch and that judge is quick to give her up
They say life is short, instead we lookin through them bars
Gotta keep yo' head up, I be lookin to the stars
I've been through alot, wasn't lookin for no cars
Didn't kill me though, now I'm hear lookin at the scars
Sometimes you get caught by people lookin from a far
That's how it is when you out here takin cookies from the jar
That's what my son said they came and took him in his draws
He support the family they took his mama favorite bra
The feds snatched my favorite boy
These the rainy days they say you should be savin for
But when sun shines no one carry umbrellas
And if they did we would look at them as dumb fellas
I'm tryin to become somethin they probably become jealous
Have alot to say about it but afraid to come tell us
I'm hear to beat the odds that was set against me
Wish the worst luck to anyone who bet against me
I wanna be somebody somebody that's never been
No squares in my circle best shape I ever been
I'm growin up my daddy planted a seed
My mama wanted me with a plan to succeed
I was that kid in the ghetto hand full of seeds
But I'm here now and I don't plan to recede
Sometime I think I lucked up at the right time
Imagined I would have fucked up that night slime
It hurts to even think about it
Would be in these streets thirsty tryin to get a drink about it
Black hoodie, I'll pull that quatro cinco 'bout it
Put that iron to yo' clothes like I'm takin wrinkles out it
Take every Franklin, Grant, Jackson and Lincoln out it
Look you in yo' eyes and tell you don't you even think about it
So as you hear me droppin this rhyme
Know my opportunity could have been stopped at a dime
The life you chose come from lack of options sometime 
Gotta do what you gotta do, even optin to crime
And who am I? without name droppin it I'm...
Someone who saw the top and didn't stop he just climbed
Someone who get money without droppin a dime
And transform to yo' leader in my Optimus Prime
So, for dinner, we stoppin at Prome
'Round of yo' patron, topped with a lime
Hold 'em up, look at yo' niggas and say
There was no way out but we figured a way
And now we chill, load it up and steal
We just wish a nigga would but we know a nigga will
But for real, good is how you feel
But soon as a nigga good is as a nigga will 
And we don't owe these niggas nothin
Put that in a nigga will
Yeah!</pre>
