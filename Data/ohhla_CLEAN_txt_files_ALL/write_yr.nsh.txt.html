'Write Your Name across the Sky'

[Verse 1]
Uh, for my name these niggaz'll die
It's only one name write mines across the sky
I gave Cheeba to escape all the true lies
I blow the smoke and lye
See the cloud spell my name in the sky
It's Nashawn!, dippin' in the lambo, Rambo, Commando
Slugs that he can't handle, he a clown
Costume jury down
Play the part in the movie he think he Out-po
Bitch!

[Hook]
'Write Your Name across the Sky'
Nashawn!
'Write Your Name across the Sky'
Bravehearts!

[Verse 2]
If I killed one of these rappers, somebody'll snitch
I ain't gon' hit 'em wit one
I put the whole Clip, .4/.5th's so sick
Head split hoe-less
I'm here to write my name to boldness
If you fuck 'Cam bitch let me know this
Cuz I think he got A.I.D.S, full blown kid
Jenny Jones don't wanna split whole Wig
Nashawn put the Murder Game down
Slugs in his Pink fitted, Coward!

[Hook]
'Write Your Name across the Sky'
Nashawn!
'Write Your Name across the Sky'
Bravehearts!

[Verse 3]
Wit a Spray can and Red paint, I ain't goin' nowhere
Been through it, Nashawn all across the Hemisphere
Spit Coffins, live off it, all these dead Corpses
Rappers rift talkin' shit, I'mma take 'em off this
Wit not problem, I'mma get mine
leave a nigga 3-piece suit, shoes spit shine
Spit .9, holdin' his chest, grabbin' his chin
I'mma put this fake rap beef to an end
Say Somethin'!

[Hook]
'Write Your Name across the Sky'
Nashawn!
'Write Your Name across the Sky'
Bravehearts!

[Verse 4]
Hands Up! - my gun is on his forehead
His man stuck, leave it to me they all dead
Nash - command demand I go in his Pocket
Hit his jaw wit the side of the glock, it's poppin'
Snatch watch off chain Yach, hard as possible
You Roc-A-Fella nigga rock you
Profit a dude leave 'em in the cut stinkin'
Write my name in his chest wit a Knife leakin'
You Homo!
