We be the untraditional metaphorically medicinal
2nafishypoo decibal peaks be my ritual
One condition though, We laying law like a municipal
Lyrics habitual, wit puffing buddha, get your crew
And Imma do the opposite of peace
And go to war so go prepare your boys for floor show
Every morsel, I'm your corporal, rather resourceful
Ripping rappers from their dome piece to their torso
No remorse for imitators, my crew be innovators
Paying homage as well as returning favors
Learning flavors from the path pavers
Now Ozomatli be makin new hits from past data take it

(Super Sundae)
It's a Super Bowl Sundae, hey

Yo, I'm Chali 2nafish, ain't no fucking twist in my posture
Lickin shots cause a brotha gots to get my propers,
Shrimp and lobster on my dock like a mobster
Givin shouts in states to sustain my stature
Altered chemically, ain't no gimmick behind
The way that I'm designing my rhyme
Line for line you'll find in your neighborhood
There's a flavor flood, whether you're a ghetto star
Or if your name is mud
I speak the truth rather courageously
And I act rather contagiously
When the stage is free, the rage in me is contained
Now the got me, Chali 2nafish and Ozomatli
