[Chorus]
Nobody wants you, they're all gonna laugh at you. (Laugh at you)
Cuz in reality, everybody hates your guts. (Yeah, they hate your guts)
I never loved you even though I know that you loved me
Gordy, you're nothing. Gordy, you're nothing. Gordy, you're nothing
Yeeeeeaaaaaah

[Verse 1]
Nobody loves me, nobody likes me
Why am I rhymin? Ain't nobody gon buy me
Can't even get nobody
No woman wants to hold me, I'm lonely. I'm a big nobody
Nobody smokes with me neither
Nobody's there to put five or get high off of my own reefer
Nobody to chill with
Get tipsy when I get rimy, kill fifths
Ain't nobody with me
Ain't got nobody to slide with me
I got a cut list on twenties, nobody rides with me
We copin with the loud sounds
Nobody give a fuck, cuz I'm the nobody around town
Don't even beef with nobody
I'm nobody to beef with, e, I got heat with nobody
Can't even sell yay on my corner
Fiends wont buy me like they ain't see nobody, guess they ain't want him

[Chorus]
Nobody wants you, they're all gonna laugh at you. (Laugh at you)
Cuz in reality, everybody hates your guts. (Yeah, they hate your guts)
I never loved you even though I know that you loved me
Gordy, you're nothing. Gordy, you're nothing. Gordy, you're nothing
Yeeeeeaaaaaah

[Verse 2]
I used to hate myself. I hated everything about me
I hated everything that breathed around me
But I'm also the most hated
When I roll on chrome they so hate it
Which one of y'all got the most hatred?
Can't get a record deal. Major labels hate me
I got no sex appeal, that's why no ladies will date me
Plus lately the daughter of my baby's been kind of crazy
Sayin she never loved me.. Aw bitch quite hating
I just hit that a week ago
Then you see me with a chick and you become a hater
Swing and hit the hoe
You got too much hate in your heart, I seen this before
Once the hatin in you starts it just eats at your soul
Will the hatred in you stop? I think not
Until you drop all your hater ways, put down the haterade and drink pop
I classify you as a hate monger
It makes me wonder if anybody ever told you they loved you or hugged ya

[Chorus]
Nobody wants you, they're all gonna laugh at you. (Laugh at you)
Cuz in reality, everybody hates your guts. (Yeah, they hate your guts)
I never loved you even though I know that you loved me
Gordy, you're nothing. Gordy, you're nothing. Gordy, you're nothing
Yeeeeeaaaaaah

[Verse 3]
I guess I'll never be nothing
They say nothing from nothing leaves nothing
I'm blind, I sees nothing
My mind forsees nothing
I'm racing, running into nothing
Trynna make me something, I am nothing
Nothing ever goes my way
You try fucking me, it's nothing
The shit you took was nothing any way
Or maybe I was just never nothing to you
Like our friendship meant nothing and I never did nothing for you
Evidentally I been nothing since the beginning
From out the womb until my funeral, I'll be nothing
I never wanted nothing
Then again nothing ever wanted me
Now we are a couple
Two nothings marry happily
Untill she divorces me ending it horribly and leaves me with nothing
It's just so sad to see..
I'm such a nothing, everybody laughs at me. [*Crying*]


[Chorus]
Nobody wants you, they're all gonna laugh at you. (Laugh at you)
Cuz in reality, everybody hates your guts. (Yeah, they hate your guts)
I never loved you even though I know that you loved me
Gordy, you're nothing. Gordy, you're nothing. Gordy, you're nothing
Yeeeeeaaaaaah</pre>
