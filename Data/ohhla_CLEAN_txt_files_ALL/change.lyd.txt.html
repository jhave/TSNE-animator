[Intro: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah.. Uh
(Yeah) I like the way that sound
Uh Uh N-N-Now (Low Down..)

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Check, nigga ya feelin like a frog in a jump
One weed will bring you from the bottom the trunk
From the trunk to the dump
I'ma rain on em, put the chump a slump
Like a rib shot, that's what the customers want
Don't cha, this ain't the typical story
Therefore I don't fall in the category
I'm cool calm and collective
You con'in a Lexus, blew chronic for breakfast
It match with the necklace
Nines only down til' the rats wanna check this
Reckless, born treacherous warn specialist
Especially if you rest next to me
Nigga come testin' me, you get the gun recipe (Pop)
These old niggaz want the new born sound
Actin' like they don't know who holdin' New York down
Yeah I used to buy Nick's
Ten years later now I'm superfly slick
Without a roof on my whip, shit
I sip a hundred-proof til' I'm ripped
And wave at the haters who got a root canal sick
Tell niggaz 'Like to make a scene' so the llama's close
That kind of shit don't fly like mumma jokes
So they got em long-short, Old kinda toast
More out of left shit, trailers all around the coast
To places you get around by boat, I get a pound I smoke
I put em down them dope
I'm real scope when I pass the block
I make traffic stop, a prodigal wave thing that make the apple rot
This apple jacks, be long before the platinum plaques
The pro tools and the wax
Take a step back before you catch a contact
The flows like an M16 with an arm-strap
I'ma bomb on niggaz until they can't bomb back
The Hiroshima demeaner, microphone crack

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
All of shit changed since a came
Alot came round here, fuckin' up the game
Therefore I ain't servin nothin but the pain
You playin, I'm hungry than a mahfucker' mayn'

Rob a store before you walk around poor
Cuz' you ain't gettin' nothin' from me you grown more
You fuelin' up the fire when you hate
So I'ma lean on ya' til' you make a mistake (I can't wait)

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Until the curtains close
It's just me and Tony, in them purple O's
Indoor overload, Drive like I own the roads
These niggaz is pus' that's why my shoulders cold
Mac by the toted bow, I'm ridin' filthy in the Beamer'
Cuz' I can have Limina Calina bring to a mister meaner
You drown in deep water, any nigga around come form the street corner
Where you need your heat on ya
I'm on the climb, 'til my next CD climbs
Southside, Greedy Dine, red wine, DB9, NYPD grind
Why, it ain't an easy grind
A nigga try to get mine, I'ma feed him nine
And it's graffiti time, niggaaz sprayin ya mural
For try'na by a motherfuckin' hero
I'm fresh, fly and flashy, Best guy if you ask me
Jet by on the nasty, nigga you in a taxi (I can't wait)

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
All of shit changed since a came
Alot came round here, fuckin' up the game
Therefore I ain't servin nothin but the pain
You playin, I'm hungry than a mahfucker' mayn'

Rob a store before you walk around poor
Cuz' you ain't gettin' nothin' from me you grown more
You fuelin' up the fire when you hate
So I'ma lean on ya' til' you make a mistake (I can't wait)

[Outro: Lloyd Banks]
Ha-Haa! Yeah! Uh!
G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!
