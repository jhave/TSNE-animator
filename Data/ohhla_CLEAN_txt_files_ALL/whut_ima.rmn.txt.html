(We be kickin yo' fat funky ass, on WKYA)

What I'ma do now, huh?  What I'ma do now, huh, huh?
What I'ma do now?  It's all fucked up now..

[Verse One]
Yo.. excuse me muh'fucka, I'm tryin to get through
When Doc loaded, I'm like a STUD missile
A STUD six-two, I'm huntin down hoes with
no drawers on and, buttoned down clothes
Don't brownnose just join it
Ecstasy pills, with Buddha Man signs stamped on it
Jam on it, the +Blair Witch+ wouldn't camp on it
I block and shine like suntan ointment
You do a dance when the lead is clipped in
Only dude with a bike with air conditionin
Fuck the Feds your door, Red'll kicked in
So prepare to wear SCUBA gear equipment
I wet it, my tape underground leakage
It hit the air and you'll swear you found Jesus
The man who turned out the Summer Jam
Not with a mic, I brrrrrrrrrrrr, tuck it in
The noise keep the helicopter hoverin
Your boys is dead weight when I muscle in
I need a +Hot Girl+, a +Ryde or Die+ chick
Mainly a hot chick ridin Funk Doc dick
Smell it, when the odor airs in
The gorilla shit, hoes in polar bear skin
The chronic stink up the overhead bin
When I.. yo, Redman struck again!

[Chorus]
What I'ma do now, huh?  What I'ma do now, huh, huh?
What I'ma do now?  It's all fucked up now..
("Can y'all hear me out there?" -&gt; Puffy)
What I'ma do now, huh?  What I'ma do now, huh, huh?
What I'ma do now?  It's all fucked up now..
("Can y'all hear me out there?" -&gt; Puffy)

[Verse Two]
Nigga, we go - oops, upside your head
+Simon Says+ leave you hogtied instead
On the floor with ya shirt like I dyed it red
Wild wild Bricks, eighty foot spider legs
Doc in, double-oh, learned to drive it
I'm, on the roof, guns under the armpit
Yellin out, "Yo sawed off, hand on the pump
and I'll pump a cannon first man that jump" {*clik-clik, BLAM!*}
I got a punch that'll cut your beard up
Doc is like warm when you touch my earmuffs
I wild out, throw blows
_Somethin about Mary_ rode me in a Ford Explorer
The pressure at time five remind me
that y'all can't eat like it's Ramadan week
My mascot was built for kamikaze
If it fails, L.O.D. right behind me

[Chorus] - 2X

("Can y'all hear me out there?  Huh?" -&gt; Puffy)
("Can y'all hear me out there?" -&gt; Puffy)
("Can y'all hear me out there?" -&gt; Puffy)
("Can y'all hear me out there?" -&gt; Puffy)

I need some weed muh'fucka..
We need to smoke muh'fucka..
We need weed muh'fucka..
We need to smoke muh'fucka..
Light it, roll it, light it up
Say light it, roll it, light it up
Say roll it, light it, light it up
Say roll it, light it, smoke it up
Say roll it, light it, smoke it up
Say roll that, light it, smoke it up
Say roll it, light it, smoke it up
Say roll it, light it, smoke it up
SAY ROLL IT, LIGHT IT, SMOKE IT UP
