Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Daughtry]
Traveled all around the world to be with you
You never know where the open road will lead you to
I crawled before I walked and still got nowhere fast
The other side still has the greener grass
Oh-oh-ohhh.. you win some and you lose some, yeah
Oh-oh-ohhh! And things look so much smarter from up here

[Chorus]
I hear it's such a lonnnnng wayyyyy down
And the climb back up ain't as easy as it sounds
I hear it's such a lonnnnng wayyyyy down
And the climb back up is just somethin I can do without!
Somethin I can do without!

[Timbaland]
C'mon
I walked until I didn't have no energy
I bought until I didn't have no bite left in me
I died so that I didn't have to live in the past
But the other side still had the greener grass

[Daughtry]
Oh-oh-ohhh.. you win some and you lose some, yeah
Oh-oh-ohhh! And things look so much smarter from up here

[Chorus]

[Timbaland] + (Daughtry)
Ow ow-ow ow ow-ow-ow (somethin I can do without!)
Ah-ow ow-ow ow, ow ow (somethin I can do without!)
Put your hands up yeah! Hey, put your hands up YEAHH!
Yeah, put your hands up yeah, hey! (Somethin I can do without!)

[Chorus] + ad libs

[ad libs]

Ah-yeahh, it's just somethin I can do withouuuut
Yeah-yeahhhh
It's just somethin I can do without!

[Outro: Daughtry] + (Timbaland)
Yeahhh yeah, just somethin I can do without!
Oh yeah, somethin I can do without!
(Frikki-frikki-frikki yeah yeahhh!) Somethin I can do without!
