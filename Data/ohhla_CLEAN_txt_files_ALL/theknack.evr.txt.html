(You got it)
(You) (you) (you) (you got it)
(You got it)

(You got it)

(You got it)

Get up everybody and listen to this rhyme
My name is Everlast and yo, I'm always on time
I got what it takes to make this groove complete
And when my DJ is cuttin, he's never missin a beat
I'm down with the Syndicate and they're down with me
I'm also down with Divine, Bilal and Quincy D.
Tairrie B., DJ Lethal and my brother Kool Nick
Kid Jazz, Scratch, Bango and Cutmaster Quick
I've worked hard and long to master this trade
And to quote my other song yo, I'm just out to get paid
So sleep on me now for my time will come
Everlast lasts forever, that's why I'm number one

I got the knack
(You got it)
(You know I feel alright)
I got the knack
(You got it)
(You know I feel alright)
I got the knack
(You got it)
(You know I feel alright)
I got the knack
(You got it)
(You know I feel alright)

Everlast is in effect
Gettin big respect
Then I collect big checks
1's, 5's, 10's, 20's
100 g's and I'm pullin honeys
Left and right, day and night
You gotta see it to believe it, it's quite a sight
They're all on my tip to get a sip
Of this poetical performer that's fully equipped
But I'm out to get paid, not to get laid
All across the country my records gettin played
On radio stations, clubs and on tours
And after every show I make three encores
Sleep on me now for my time will come
Everlast last forever, that's why I'm number one

I got the knack
(You got it)
(You know I feel alright)
I got the knack
(You got it)
(You know I feel alright)
I got the knack
(You got it)
(You know I feel alright)
I got the knack
(Ah yeah)
(Hit me)
(Alright)

Step up, place your bet and I'll serve you fortune
But first I must issue just one word of caution
Dope lyric presentations are my sole notoriety
Everlast is on the rise movin through society
My voice is moist recitin choice vocals
Respected worldwide and feared by locals
Poppin junk out your punk mouth makin bets
It's too late for regrets, it's time to pay your debts
E-v-e-r-l-a-s-t is the name that I bear
A poetic demi-god with skin that's fair
So sleep on me now for my time will come
Everlast lasts forever, that's why I'm number one

I got the knack
(You got it)
(You know I feel alright)
I got the knack
(You got it)
(You know I feel alright)
I got the knack
(You got it)
(You know I feel alright)
I got the knack
(You got it)
(You know I feel alright)

Now there's too many people in this world tryin to play me
Like I'm some kind of sucker constantly they disobey me
Tellin me what's sellin, what kinda records get charted
Sound like him, sound like her - but they all sound retarded
Takin very little time to write down a rhyme
It's confusing to see so many people so blind
Some think that it's a sell-out rhymin to this beat
But Everlast can take any groove and make it sound complete
I got the knack</pre>
