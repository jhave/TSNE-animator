The G-O-D
Aiyyo, check it out...It's God's Son
I know I always give you clowns a little lean to come out
Cause I drop every two years...but it's over now, you know? Hah

[Chorus]
The G-O-D S-O-N
K-I-N-G O-F N-Y-C
That's me [x4]

[Hook]
Is it because I got the city on smash now
Oh woe woe
Or is it because your time's up and it's a wrap now
Hey hey hey hey

[Verse 1]
In the papers you read that Nas is crazy
Lost his mind as he leavin Sony
The INC got him signed
It's only a figment of your imagination
Went to way with New York's Hot radio station
Lost my patience, had to zone out
Rappers blown out, I have the throne now
The real shall reign, I feel your pain
You R&amp;B, follow me, spell my name

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
God's Son across the belly
Pardon, I'm hardly a bully
But what y'all done to hip hop is scary
Nas'll be truly the, last soldier to roll with
Holdin it down, my proteges are over with now
A producer like Swizz Beats, on fire
So is the control room, soon as my vocals are down
Nas - God's Son, and y'all my little children
So bounce with it, if you can pronounce the correct spellin

[Chorus x1]</pre>
