[Chorus x2]
It's gonna be alright
Keep your head up to the sky
[Z-Ro] Cause everything's gon' be alright

[Z-Ro]
Too many problems in my life I find myself unable to maintain
The nigga that was takin over my brain
Redesignin my main frame
Developin so much hatred I feel like fuck all of y'all
And for the slightest disrespect I would gladly touch all of y'all
Dedicated to doing bad and addicted to drama
People think I'm missin manners at home training but I'm just missin my momma
It's like I don't fit in this bullshit world
Surrounded by bullshit boys and bullshit bitches
Better murder they own people before they come up
And that's why I be mean muggin every son of a bitch that walk or run up
I'm paranoid my nigga, I keep one in the chamber
Willing to trade my freedom for life and live among strangers
My goal is to become one hundred and ten years old
I found myself but I can't grow until I find my soul
Stuck on 25 but hopefully I'll survive, I'll make it
Receiving hard pain from L.O.V.E., but I'll take it

[Chorus x2]

[Z-Ro]
Dear Cookie I know you looking at ya son from heaven
Totally clean and blessed without ???, drugs, and weapons
Wish I could open up the pearly gates and see your face
But I gotta sinful life momma and I may not get to see that place
I just can't keep my cool, mother fuckers messin with the wrong weapon
I pull out my Jimmy Bone switchblade and start cuttin'
Nigga you aint never known pain, you don't want this in your ??? vein
Rusty blades make aim cream spread like mayonnaise magn
I can't think of nothin' that ever made me feel like that dro
Not even a woman, cause as quick as she comes she out the do'
Can't put my trust up in Eve, cause she got tricks up her sleeve
All I wanna do is live until I'm D.E.A.D.
Of natural causes I don't need nobody knockin' me off
Just let me fall bitch get out the way you blockin' me off
Stuck in the same spot but hopefully I'll survive, I'll make it
Disrespected by the people I love, but I'll take it

[Chorus x3]</pre>
