I've been sittin' here trying to find myself
I get behind myself I need to rewind myself
Looking for the payback listening for the playback
They say that every man bleeds just like me
And I feel like number one yet I'm last in line
I watch my younger son and it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain
I made a couple of dollare bills still I feel the same
Everybody knows my name they say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me it's hard to hang out in a croud
I guess that's the price you pay to be some big shot like I am
Out strecthed hands and one night stands
Still I can't find love and when the walls are tumbling down
I will always be around
Yea.....

And when the walls are tumbling down I will always be around
People don't know about the things I say and do
They don't understand about the shit I've been through
Its been so long since I've been home
I've been gone, I've been gone way too long
Maybe I've forgotten all the things I miss
Oh, somehow I know there is more to life than this
I've said it too many times and I still stand firm
You get what you put in and people get what the deserve
Still I aint seen mine, no I aint seen mine
I've been given but just aint gettin' I've been walkin that thin line
So I think I'll keep a  walking with my head held high
I'll keep moving on and only God knows why
Only God, Only God, Only God knows why
Only God knows why,why,why,why
Only God knows why
Take it to the river, hey..
Take it to the river, hey..</pre>
