Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It ain't nothing now cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing now cut that bitch off

So what you saying, hoe?
You Know I'm the man, hoe?
Nothing but a bird, I'mma leave you where you stand, hoe
Heard you got a man, hoe
Hope he understand, though
You ain't nothing but a creeper, I'm just saying, though
Saying, though

It ain't nothing now cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing now cut that bitch off

Creeping on the low, hope your man don't see
She will bust it down for some damn limeritas
Chew me like some bubblegum, something like Rasheeda
Gotta get my partner some, she on me like Adidas
Baby, you can't hold, better stop flexing like you might
Your man tryna patrol then I guess he is a cop
But he really can't cuff if you busting at my spot
But I done had enough 'cause you making my shit hot
Blowing up a nigga phone, what I tell yo ass 'bout that?
Tryna hold something, hold my nuts, can you do that?
Can you play around with that mouth while he hit it from the back?
You can't say nothing now 'cause we all been through with that, through with that

It ain't nothing now cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing now cut that bitch off

So what you saying, hoe?
You Know I'm the man, hoe?
So what you saying, hoe?
You Know I'm the man, hoe?

You know that ain't a real bad bitch, that's a knock off
When I get that work I get jerkin' like hot sauce
Outdoor pool like front, hit her from the back real ranger likes front
Stuntin', Tattoos on my neck and on my kidneys
If I don't like that hoe I turn her ass into a Frisbee
If I don't like your diss I turn that hoe into a Frisbee
I throw it at them all net white about a Wendy's
Three cell phones and all of them junky
I can see your hoes and all of them nothin
Yeah I'm a done done, Jeetle done Cornelius Watch the done spill
Pockets fat as done caught a Jeeta nigga done deal

It ain't nothing now cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing now cut that bitch off

So what you saying, hoe?
You Know I'm the man, hoe?
So what you saying, hoe?
You Know I'm the man, hoe?

Baby, I'm ashamed, why you acting this way?
Heard she 'bout that action, you can bring her this way
Hit her on yo mattress, make her feel some type of way
Pass her to my migos, they gonna bust it, on delay
Please don't play no games 'cause I know just what you like
Knock it off the frame, baby girl, it's alright
Yeah, that pussy bomb, I just call it dynamite
You ready? Here I come, I can do this shit all night

It ain't nothing now cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing now cut that bitch off

So what you saying, hoe?
You Know I'm the man, hoe?
Nothing but a bird, I'mma leave you where you stand, hoe
Heard you got a man, hoe
Hope he understand, though
You ain't nothing but a creeper, I'm just saying, though
Saying, though

It ain't nothing now cut that bitch off (Cut That Bitch Off) [x2]
