[Chorus]
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya

[Kurupt]
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
I'm the motherfucker they callin' to take care of ya
From the A (from the A) to Bulgaria
Pimpin' bitches all over this area
Don't act hard now motherfucker
Cause your homies with ya now motherfucker
Cause I'll lay ya down motherfucker
And every nigga with ya, this the Pound motherfucker
So original, diabolicle individuals
Retarded residuals, criminals, indivisible
Enter invisible, ready to dump it out
Me and D-A-Z rollin', blastin' and dumpin' down

[Chorus]
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya

[Daz Dillinger]
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
We run the hood, ain't nobody here scared of ya
One-time can't hold me back
Motherfuckers better get the gat and show me where it's at
We bust on 'em at point-blank range, niggaz small change
Niggaz bring the fire, I'll bring the pain
Burn up the block, destroyin' what you're made of
The way we did your homies, we showin' the same love
Pistol grip, blood will mash, you know that we shoot 'em
Creep on his bitch ass and you know that we do him
Money, dope, blowin' too - we takin' the whole pie
No lie my nigga, the whole house gotta die

[Chorus]
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya

[Kurupt]
Bomb on his homie so the function is official
Run up on the next nigga, keep pressin' the issue
Take off on that nigga lookin' at you all funny
Nigga what he wanna do, it's murder or money
Seperate every one of 'em, I'm murderin' money

[Daz Dillinger]
What the fuck you lookin' at, nigga you want somethin' from me?
Rollin' in the 'Llac, with the gauge in the back
Nigga say somethin' smart I'ma lay his ass flat
I ain't for that bullshit when you're yappin' ya mouth
You'll get fucked up, "Aiyyo" and all that fuckin "What's up"
Step another step I'll erase your rep
He didn't listen so well so he got his shirt wet

[Chorus]
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya</pre>
