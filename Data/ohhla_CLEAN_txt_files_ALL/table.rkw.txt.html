[Raekwon]
Moet got me actin like a fuckin goat in here
Yo god, remember back in the days god?
When we came a long way and shit, man?
(No question)
Supposed to be blessin each other on our physical days and shit
Yaknowimsayin, it's like basically
I wanna hit my family wit like land and all that
Diamonds and all that, we ran through that chamber dunn

Mainly stack mine, indeed it's been a long time
Let me feed y'all, fruits of life, shut up and eat y'all
Flavors for neighbors, Wallee's down to gators
The whole configuration stackin paper
Yo we do this, on the low though
If so, we runnin John dolo
First thing, you need if you don't know
We carry cuz it's a real world, show and prove
In ill words, all my herbs know the slurge
Dress nasty like fuck, keep my bird on the job yo
You got to straighten up, do the worst thing to hurt her heart, damn
Took care of that, shared, even shed a tear for that
Bust my gat to throw gear on her back
Damn son, why she takin you through that?
She's a part of me, pardon me flow Allah, we sworn we
Wisin up, take care of home bases
Then we slide to another part and start more hatred
Life is sacred
The other side of that paw, you lie naked
Clothes in the box, go 'head take it
Flash back Jew status, salute moms and get ya boots splattered
Batting average, ya moms had it
Just a broke young dumb, full of cum
Ready to haunt something, takes something of yours
Here you want something
Growing up around fifteen
Watchin how the big niggas rollin wit big cream, big schemes
Quick to flash ya gat, laser beam
Pool table action black, hundred stacks made my niggas leave
Some be sayin "Let em breathe"
The others wanna deceive, how we gonna make it if we don't achieve?
Right now, catch it from a vertical degree yo
We startin showin our asses, committing burgularies
One got caught, threw us all off
Threw us in the hell section near the boardwalk
Wonderin how the sword talk
Did he fall off? Did he stand like the hawk that he was in New York?
Kept the waves spinnin on the cross, of course
Come back a little cutty endorse
Risked it for his kids the pain is lost
We sittin back on a better note
Yellin "Peace god, I love you love you to death, you thoroughbredable"
The Robbin Hood of the hood
Sit back, it's all good, won't spoil it if we call it, we all hood
Ha ha

[Masta Killa]
I make knowledge born to save self, you know?
Who gon' live it, gon' live it
Be is to be a born, knawmean?

Soaked in degrees of knowledge, polished by sun rays
Carving by nine swordsmen to a needle point of perfection
It's a blessing to deliver this lesson
While travellin the planet, extending development
And vote for the mind, never ended
We now send it long winded, descended
Infital, Bobby Digital, Abbot of the Shaolin now
Wit knowledge and wisdom
The original sword style begin, birth of the Wu-Tang Clan</pre>
