[Guru]
You ain't livin right punk, I'll have to school you
Not rule you, but I'll say yo you fool yourself
When you try to deny and defy written laws
This means your cause has lost
Think about it, take the time, and even ponder longer
Then let your mind start to wander
Go black and track the facts, about all of your mistakes
It only takes to one to make fate
Pick up your life, clean up your act, and get a legal plan
You can, or be an evil man
Caught, and then you claim you're not responsible
The choice was yours, when the fun's gone you will realize
that you don't get somethin for nothin, why you bluffin?
Others even brothers are stuffin their pockets
with honest cash, they'll laugh, so don't knock it
Jock it, cause the Guru must stop it
I'll jab you, smack you, crack -- you're demolished
You must acknowledge -- life is like a college in itself
Get a degree in reality
Or you will be upon it like a lawn you'll be walked on
Gone, never to see or be the same again
Friend, cause the time you spend
Bringin down yourself, bringin down the pace
Bringin down your friends, bringin down the race
will have your life in a wreck
And homeboy life is cause and effect

[Guru]
Exactly what you put in boy, you will get out of it
The energy released comes back, there is no doubt of it
So when you thrive to connive and contrive foolish deeds
This means you'll bleed from greed
Dig the rhyme dig the thought, of what'll happen
You're nappin, you're gonna fall off the map 'n'
lie out, and cry out, why?  You got the short end of the stick
Cause you're too quick to run tricks
Open your mind, widen your sight, get out of your rut
MOVE, and get the lead out of your butt
Cause you can't live without a plan to get freshed chump
and you shouldn't stand to let
anything sway you from the path you know is truthful
Chill, cause you know the chosen youth will
take over, and control the whole so don't blow it
Know it, cause the Guru must show it
I'll teach you, reachin each so you're enlightened
Emcees are frightened, by what I write in my songs
Cause I express what I manifest
While some of you fall down to the ground with breakdowns
never to see or be the same again
Friend, cause the time you spend
Bringin down yourself, bringin down the pace
Bringin down your friends, bringin down the race
will have your life in a wreck
And homeboy life is cause and effect

[Guru]
You're still playin games lame, I'll have to end you
Straight to the gate of fate, so you can claim your doom
Will you decay as you pay in repentance
I light my sentence like incense
Breathe in, expel your fears as you marvel
Heed what I feed, you won't starve you'll make it
But if you don't, you will be finished
You'll dissapear, you will diminish
never to see or be the same again
Friend, cause the time you spend
Bringin down yourself, bringin down the pace
Bringin down your friends, bringin down the race
will leave you bugged and upset
Cause homeboy life is cause and effect
Cause and effect!!
