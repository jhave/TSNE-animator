Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
The only kiss I ever need, it comes from you
I always love you in my dreams, then you came true
the only lips I wanna kiss, belong to you
cause there ain't nobody else like her
in this world. this is why I need you baby girl!

[Verse 1]
When we first went out together we barely knew each other
but in no time at all we were messin up the covers
kissing every where at anywhere like secret lovers
I knew from that day there will never be another
and this is why I dedicate you my life
so we can be together til the sun don't shine
and we can show the world nothing will come between
to be without you girl I'd rather not breath

Hey Girl! In your eyes I see the diamonds in the sky
the kisses from your lips are like strawberries in a way
the sweet smell of your perfume
we on the phone makin plans for when daddy comes home
I know its been long, I know I've been gone
but honestly, I wanna thank you
for your loyalty and that's why I spoil you
and treat you like royalty, baby your the world to me

[Chorus]
The only kiss I ever need, it comes from you
I always love you in my dreams, then you came true
the only lips I wanna kiss, belong to you
cause there ain't nobody else like her
in this world. this is why I need you baby girl!

[Verse 2]
I need you mamacita y tu sabes la verdad
I love it when you tell me ill always be the one
that ever since you met me your life is not the same
and when were not together, theirs like an empty space
I feel the same and I can't hide the feelin'
like I'm in Vegas and I finally made a killin
so tell the world I'm never gonna let you go
and Ima love you until your heart beats no more
my heart will never stop, for you, for you ill never stop
I miss your love, your kisses like a cherry drop
see Ima rida, and ridaz never ride alone
so trust me baby, come and let me take you home
I know you waitin', I'm tellin' you I'm here to stay
lets come together, together we will never part
just say I do girl I'll love you with all my heart [echo x3]

[Chorus]
The only kiss I ever need, it comes from you
I always love you in my dreams, then you came true
the only lips I wanna kiss, belong to you
cause there ain't nobody else like her
in this world, this is why I need you baby girl!

[Outro]
This one is for you baby!</pre>
