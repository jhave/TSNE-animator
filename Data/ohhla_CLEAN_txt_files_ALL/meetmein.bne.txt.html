(Hook: K-Young &amp; Layzie Bone)
You can you meet me meet me in the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky
You could meet me in the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky 
Cause we flyin' above the haters! 
They done gave me wings
Lets fly, high, high, high, high (4X)
Cause we flyin' above the skyscrapers!

(Verse 1: Layzie Bone)
I done made it up the mountain lookin' down on the valley
and I'm feelin' I can fly so I dive off the cliff
Hear the little kids scream they don't know I got wings
til I sprinkle them with the dreams and I hit 'em with the gift
Say bye bye to them haters, haters, no more lies
they can't fade us, fade us why they wanna test
Now you rockin' with the best and my whole fam fam is the greatest, greatest
Moves countin' like a calculator evaluate the master
playas operation stack your paper captivatin money makers 
Feel the love from above he's an eagle he's a dove call him Bone's emancipator
Everybody's a congratulator
Come and ride on this elevator 
Better yet take this escalator
Graduate to the new skyscrapers

(Verse 2: Flesh -N- Bone)
When we put 'em on a level that's if you can deal with!
We take it to 'em runnin' nothin' but realness!
Surely livin' in the life it's for the thrills 
We went up and over the hill 
Went through the whole drill 
Haters try to kill with kindness but there's nothin' they can do to the finest
Though they won't dare cross over the line for tryin' 
Y'all know what's gonna happen so they might as well remain behind us, way behind
We on the hardcore grind
I never take my mission for granted since I'm cool they go and take it for weakness
Better take it in stride
They don't wanna see us alive but yet we steady creepin', reapin', weepin'
Niggas went and got in way too deep in (deep in)
You gotta practice that before you start preachin' (preachin')
But ain't no way that they can keep up (keep up)
Cause we keepin' the heat on it really don't matter where we can meet up

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Wish Bone)
Nigga had it bad
Cause I never had more than plenty cash
Thinkin' that the rainy days was over
Livin' in the past livin' ghetto fab
Never lookin' back
But the fact is that I never wen nowhere
The truth is me and my own ghetto got a love affiar (love affiar)
It's so real things we did my conscience outta here
I don't care I deserve everything I earn
Hell yeah I deserve some pain
I know I hurt
Stop talkin' night walkin' real night stalkers, zoners, hungry heard it here first
Don't believe me
With wings I'll meet ya

(Verse 4: Krayzie Bone)
Playa, hater, hate 
They can hate me but they better stay away or see Krayzie loc' insane
So if they wanna hate me let 'em hate me from the bottom, way up underneath my feet
Cause really I done turned a new leaf
to never ever let the suckas rise or let them bustas kill the high
Cause they jealous in the mind
they remind me of gravity always grabbin' at me, pullin' me down
Bad storm for the flight, keepin' me on the ground
Still I rise and when I takeoff they fall (they fall, they fall)
Raise to the ceiling, try and stay away from the pretender
You don't really even get involved (volved)
We play em all from afar in a distance (distance)

(Hook)

(Verse 5: Bizzy Bone)
And when I met him in the sky
He had a body like a man and the lower body tellin' The Lord
that he had a plan to make Him sure I wasn't evil
But i'm comin' with my people ain't no sequel ain't no women ain't no vessels
I'ma settle with a scepter and a lethal dosage
I will live forever with a serpent on my head
Little glory that's my man I'll be damned
If I comin' through i'm runnin' with my pistol 
Weren't for Moses ima die but ima come back wit' ya (wit' ya, wit' ya)
That's the way to get ya (get ya) 
Picture sinister plots
I'm not nigga with no land I imagine a strand of lightning bolts and tightened ropes
I'm fightin' folk with no hope
Earth got me loc'ed now chillin' in the smoke house
No doubt, no clout, now we're goin' all out
Earthball that's all
Never let the devil call
Revelations little Biggie nigga so long, go long
Metal was so precious I was resurrected, why?
Juniors fly to The Creator
And my brother be, brother be 'C', throw it up
Uncle 'L' comin' straight from the sky what
