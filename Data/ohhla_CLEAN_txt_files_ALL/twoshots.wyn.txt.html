[Lil Wayne]
Uhh! Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryin to pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure leave my money on the dresser
Goons in this bitch, leave a nigga on a stretcher
It's all there poppa, you ain't even got to measure
Laughing at how my old bitches look jealous
Well what goes around comes around - propellers
Mon-money over bitches, M.O.B., goodfellas
Cut her ears off, ain't shit she could tell us
Write your name on the bullet that's a fuckin love letter
If I ain't a trendin topic, I'ma fuckin trendsetter
Hehe! Uhh

[Chorus]
I'm on two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
Man it's like tug-of-war, tryin to pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure leave my money on the dresser

[Lil Wayne]
If you're scared, go to church, Mason Betha
Sometimes the paper chase could be like chasin a leopard
The pussy wetter, we-wetter than it's ever been	
But she gon' probably try to cross the line like a Mexican
I ain't on that bullshit, shawty fine as fuck though
Now she kiss me on my neck, I hope she ain't cutthroat
Cut down on the syrup, cause it made me fuck slow
Shoot so many times, I'ma choke off the gun smoke
Life, death, love, hate, pleasure, pain
Pay me no mind, but I don't have change
I cock back and aim at your membrane
Broad day, no mask, close range
Bop bop! Ha ha...
You can get two shots from wherever, two shots from whoever
It be like a puzzle tryin to put you back together
I should probably do better, but probably whatever

[Lil Wayne]
Your bullshit is stinkin up the place
Me-me no take bad up, me a done de place
Cain't let these bitch niggaz slide, and touch base
I make her cum so many times call her Nut Case
It's Young Money baby, take your clothes off
Give me them three holes - uhh, bowling ball
Ha ha~! Two shots of whatever
Keep them bitches comin, and she gon' do whatever

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever</pre>
