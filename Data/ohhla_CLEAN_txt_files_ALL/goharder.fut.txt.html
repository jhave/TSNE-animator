Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I done been lied to
I been neglected
I done had all kind of people turn against me
You try to break me down I'ma go harder
You try to break me down I'ma go harder
I done took losses
I done been crossed I done heard all kind of rumors that were false
You try to break me down I'ma go harder
You try to break me down I'ma go harder

You can't break me, I'm solid
I go hard Bout It
Can't break me down I break laws
Don't never abide by it
I let my hater be my motivator and keep grindin'
I make my moves when I wanna make my moves cuz I ain't even tryin' to
Listen to no nother nigga talkin bout
Wat he gon do and he lyin'
I see it if I want it I'ma get it straight up buyin' it
I learned dat free band shit cuz free band shit clothing line I designed it
Ain't thinking bout da 13 years to see bout a young nigga to finally
Dis G5 G6 classified I don hit da bullseye
When you spread da rumors make sure you tell em I'm a multi millionaire
Ain't playin' fair
Touch ya bag Ion even care cuz I can wake up any day travel anywhere

[Chorus]

They try to show approve
You'd rather see me lose
But I refuse to lose
I run off jet fuel
I'm makin' major moves
You tryna peep da move
I dropped 10 hits
I got a refuse
I hear they my enemy
I make em in my sleep
Dats all you want from me
I know I'm makin' history
I know you greasy and you greedy
But I'm a genius and I been feenin' to set da streets on fire
You catch me flying by
Ain't got no time to stop to kick da bobo wit ya boy
My time is precious dats right every second
Too many hard times I'm thinking bout investments

[Chorus]

You watch me go thru hell
You seen me run thru dem bales
You know I hit dem corners everyday and caught dem sales
You hatin' muthafuckas don't wanna see a kid prevail
Got hit up wit da shell Now my CD on da shelf
If I can take a bullet then I can take take da rumors
Thru all da losses I never lost my sense of humor
I kept pushing You kept lookin'
Hoping I fall even at my worst I'm at ur best
Laws and all thru scars and all
I'm standin' tall I won't fold
I got money coming out my pores, music, and my soul
I run da globe I'm in my mode dis ain't no flow
Throughout da riches I know dat road

[Chorus]</pre>
