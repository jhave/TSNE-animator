[Intro: Juelz Santana Intro]
Okay (Jazze)
We in the motherfucking building (Dip Set bitch)
I heard my man T.I. is the motherfucking king of the south (uh huh)
Well I'm the the motherfucking prince of the city
(you already know)(Santana)
And when the king and the prince get together it's nothing but royalty
(roll the mat out)
So we going to get down like this
YEAH!

[Juelz Santana]
Now if I ain't gangsta who is
You is truth is you ain't I am who this clown ass nigga

Up north hustler with a bank head nigga now bounce!
That's just jazze on the beat again
Tappin on machines again its cracking threw your speakers in
That's what it sounds like when I'm in the South right
Put it down put it round bouncing threw your town like
Uh bang first play second aim first prey second make dirt day heaven
I'm a crack baller straight sevens mack holder spray seven at your back soldier

Got them super clean with dubs on that
Hey! First nigga put my name in a rap
Getting robbed on the spot at hard getting shot

First thing first start with a glock
Then step it up to choppas, gauges, then elevens mack 10's

[Chorus]

[Juelz Santana]

Hold up we senseless make you throw up your breakfast
Me and T.I. hold the connection

[T.I.]
Me and Santana from Harlem to Atlanta
The cocaine managers hoe brain damager
I'd be god damned if a nigga wanna cock hammers
and split bandanas on niggaz with bad manners
You wanna kill me you willing to ride the hell with me
Seven shot revolver I'm taking my shells with me
You don't want no trouble with niggaz like us
Try me I'll fuck your whole life up
To the group of haters that don't like us
Dip Set fuck nigga now what

[Chorus]</pre>
