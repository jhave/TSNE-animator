[Ice Cube]
I went to the free clinic, it was filled to capacity
Now how bad can a piece of ass be?
Very bad, so I had to make the trip
and thank God, I didn't have the drips
I was there so a hoe couldn't gimme that
Just to get - twenty free jimmy hats
Now look who I see
Ain't that... yeah, that's the bitch from up the street!
With the big fat tail
who always told Cube to go to hell
She thought she was wiser
Now she's sittin in the waitin room, burnin like heat-mizer
Yeah I see ya
First Miss Thang, now Miss Gonorrhea
Man it's a trip how the world keeps turnin
It's 1991, and look who's burnin

Chorus One: various samples (repeat 2X)

"Does it get you hot?"		"It's got me hot!"
"This is a girl playin hard to get.." -&gt; Slick Rick
"Burnin up, burnin!"
"What have I, done stuck my dick in?" -&gt; Kool Moe Dee

[Ice Cube]
Now everybody is a victim, you can go see 'em
and you'll hear more claps than the Coliseum
Sittin there all quiet and embarrassed
Whup - there go that bitch who was careless
I remember - she wouldn't give the cock
to anybody who lived on the block
Now hoe, look what you got
BEND THAT BIG ASS OVER for the shot
Cause somebody is pipin hot
Drippin like a faucet, I'm glad I didn't toss it
Got you a college boy, who was worse than me
and he probably fucked the whole university
Still wanted him to dick you down, kick you down
with some bucks, now who got fucked?
With a nigga for the money he's earnin
but ask for some water bitch, and look who's burnin

Chorus Two: various samples (repeat 2X)

"Does it get you hot?"		"Can you get that?"
"This is a girl playin hard to get.." -&gt; Slick Rick
"Burnin up, burnin!"
	"Why is my thing-thing burnin like this?"

Interlude: more samples

"It burns.."	{*man moaning in pain, urinating sound*}
"Fitfully, sputteringly to it's end.."	{*aww shit!!*}
".. at which there is, a little surprise"
	{*That stupid ass..*}	"BITCH!!!!"

[Ice Cube]
Yo, it ain't my fault you got the heebie-jibbies
but you still try to act like you didn't see me
So I walk over, and say "Hi,
bitch, don't try to act surprised!"
You shoulda put a sock on the pickle
and your pussy wouldn't be blowin smoke signals
Man, this is gonna kill 'em
Guess who got a big fat dose of penicillin?
They'll ask, "Who?", and I tell 'em you
The new leader of the big booty crew
And after the day, I'm sorry to say
You come through the neighborhood, you couldn't give it away
To a nigga, who's out to get major paid
but you'll have him, pissin out razorblades
But a bitch like you..ll be returnin with the H-I-V, R.I.P.

Chorus Three: various samples (repeat 2X)

"You can't trust a big butt and a smile.." -&gt; KRS-One
	"I'm burning up!"
"You can't trust a big butt and a smile.." -&gt; KRS-One
"You can't trust a big butt and a smile.." -&gt; KRS-One
	"I'm burning up!"
"What have I, done stuck my dick in?" -&gt; Kool Moe Dee

[Outro]
".. done stuck my dick in?"
	"I'm burning up!"
"It's hot.. I'm burning up!"</pre>
