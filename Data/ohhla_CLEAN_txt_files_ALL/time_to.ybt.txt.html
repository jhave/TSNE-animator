Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

It's time to make the dough nutz (*repeat 8X*)

[Verse One]
You see it's off to the store I got to go it's how I make the doughnutz
This way at the end of the week yo I collect the bonus
Sunday Monday Wednesday Friday the wrath is risin in the kitchen
The rest of the week I'm zonin - THE SKINS ARE FINGER LICKIN
Big brothers owe me the loot and some are frontin from the stoop
It's bounty huntin time and someone's gonna catch the boot
in the ass - no questions, don't tell me no more lies
Don't be steppin onto the block, the price you pay is high (how high?)
I'm crackin 'em up and beatin 'em down as verily we roll along
Brothers know my style, my grip is just TOO strong
So figure it out yourself and you'll soon see that I don't sweat 'em
His back's against the wall I say spread 'em then I wet 'im
So hi-ho hi-ho hi-ho, it's off to work I go
I figured I'd let you know, here's the flow
It's time to make the dough, nutz, the dough, nutz
I hear the funky beats and I go, nutz

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
It's time (what time is it?) It's time (what time is it?)
It's time (what time is it?) It's time to make the dough nutz

[Verse Two]
Yes rappin again the flow I've got no time to sit and pause
Cause when I cook the steel I hear the suckers hit their jaws
I flow from the tongue to let you know just who is up next
Firstborn just slayed the rhythm the opposite of breakin necks
Cause I can rip the best like use the glock to mix the batter
Flex the same ingredients I went to (?) it doesn't matter
Splatter, scatter, if you move there's nothin left
Petrified by the dough nutz cause the beats are made to death
So after that you're left a hole in the middle
So hey diddle diddle, the Kamron's on the fiddle
So who's got the blunts with the booooom?
Make room for the zoom of a Y.B.T. tune
If your brain is still drownin then you're dooooomed

Dough, nutz, the dough, nutz
I hear the funky beats and I go, nutz

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now I'm bringin it back in so let me spark it for the crew
The oven is burnin hot, so look out we're comin through
Cause the funk is on, MC givin livin up the cookies
Tossin up the styles as we bake it for the rookies
Playin hookies from the back, what does it take to slam a hit?
I'm missin dunkin the donuts is it really worth the trip?
To the top, they go pop, halfway up, we get stopped
But we keep it hip-hop add a little twist of rock
So it's up and away, it's up and away, it's up and away we go
We're opening up the bakery, it's time to make the dough-di-oh</pre>
