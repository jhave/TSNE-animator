Roll out!

[repeat 6x]
Roll out! Roll out! Roll out! Roll out!

   [Chorus - "roll out!" in background]
   I got my twin glock .40's, cocked back
   Me and my homies, so drop that
   We rollin on twenties, with the top back
   So much money, you can't stop that
   Twin glock .40's, cocked back
   Me and my homies, so drop that
   We rollin on twenties, with the top back
   So much money, you can't stop that

[Ludacris]
Now where'd you get that platinum chain with them diamonds in it?
Where'd you get that matchin Benz with them windows tinted?
Who dem girls you be with when you be ridin through?
Man I ain't got nothin to prove, I paid my dues
Breakin the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin a CRUISE!
Tell me who's your weed man, and how do you smoke so good?
You'se a superstar boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that BAG, what you got in that BAG?
A couple a cans of whoop ass, you did a good-ass job
of just eyein me, spyin me

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Man, that car don't come out until next year
Where in the fuck did you get it?
That's eighty-thousand bucks GONE!
Where in the fuck did you spend it?
You must have eyes on your back, cause you got money to the ceiling
And the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin
The better I'm feelin, the more that I'm chillin
Willin, drillin and killin the feelin
Now who's that bucked-naked cook fixin three-course meals?
Gettin goosebumps when her body tap the six inch heels
What in the world is in that ROOM, what you got in that ROOM?
A couple a gats, a couple of knives
A couple of rats, a couple of wives, now it's time to choose

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Are you custom-made, custom-paid, or you just custom-fitted?
Playstation 2 up in the ride and is that Lorenzo-kitted?
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just yo; main bitch?
You take a pick, while I'm rubbin the hips
touchin lips to the top of the dick and then WHOOO!
Now tell me who's your housekeeper and what you keep in yo' house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in yo' mouth?
What in the world is in that CASE, what you got in that CASE?
Get up out my face, you couldn't relate, wait to take place
at a similar pace so shake, shake it

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Get out my business, my biznass
Stay the fuck up out my biznass, ah
Cause these niggaz all up in my shit
and it's my business, my biznass
Stay the fuck up out my biznass
cause it's mine, all mine
My business, my biznass
Stay the fuck up out my biznass
Cause these niggaz all up in my shit
and it's my business, my biznass
Stay the fuck up out my biznass
cause it's mine, all mine

Ahh ahh, Timbaland, Ludacris
Disturbin' Tha Peace, whoo!</pre>
