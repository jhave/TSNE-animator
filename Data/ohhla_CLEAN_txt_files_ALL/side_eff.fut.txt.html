Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse]
You pay my team
Hold down my crew
You wash my clothes
You buy my grocery
You stay up late
You say whatever
That's whatever it take
You fucking slick stuff
It ain't hard to tell
Ask so know how it feel
But read my mail
Baby, I suppose I take you serious
Keep talkin' dirty, I love to hear it

[Chorus]
Cause I never took nothin' from you
Just tell me what it cost
Bonds to the fire
And when we run to the finish
No screens, no cake
Cause I gotta be honest, if you want it all
I give it to you
Side effects, no side effects
No side effects, I give it all to you
Side effects, I give it all to you

[Verse]
My nigga stay floating across yo water
I give you pleasure, you play your part
I smoke too much, say you don't mind
At least you make, make up for your time
You fucking superstar, you fucking up
Ain't bout that talking, hey girl, are you sure?
Giving me some, never taking it back
Ain't no side effects, remember that

[Chorus]
Cause I never took nothin' from you
Just tell me what it cost
Bonds to the fire
And when we run to the finish
No screens, no cak
Cause I gotta be honest, if you want it all
I give it to you
Side effects, no side effects
No side effects, I give it all to you
Side effects, I give it all to you</pre>
