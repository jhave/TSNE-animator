[Let's get it on, I'm open real wide!]

Chorus {2x}:  Mr. Mixx
I wanna do the damn thaaaaAAANG! (Then do the damn thing!)
I wanna do the damn thaaaang! (Then do the damn thing!)


Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
I'm a bad motherfucker bringin' hoes to their knees
Fresh Kid Ice, long dick Chinese
Always on a mission 'cause I like to fuck
The way I hit the pussy is in the buck
Strokin' up and down, always takin' my time
Doin' it all till I make you mine
I rub your body with motion lotion
Lick you down like waves in the ocean
Do it till you're satisfied
Have you moan even though you're tired
I've fucked many bitches across the land
And no one slangs dick like the Chinaman
You ain't been fucked 'cause your pussy's froze
Many are called but few are chose
Bust them guts like it ain't no thing
So bitch stop frontin', let's do the damn thing!

Chorus

Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
Bitch, do you wanna swing with me?
Sex is the best with Brother Marquis
All hoes let my record show
All my bitches come back for more
It must be the way I throw my thang
It must be the way I spit my game 
Look 'em in they eye, tell a quick lie
Kiss 'em and they cry, I don't know why
Game so strong, yet so convincin'
Give me a minute, I'm up in it
Talk 'em out they draws real cool
"Bitch, give it up smooth, you know the rules!"
True love ain't so hard to find
It's right between your legs and mine
None of my bitches, they never complain
They like the way I do the damn thing!

Chorus

Verse 3
[Marquis]  I love it when a bitch be like pro-per
           A hooche with a coochie that'll let me pop her
           The "Blac Vagina Finda"
           Once I'm inside I must remind her
           Pussy's deception, dick's a weapon
           After I fuck, I'm steppin'
           Damn right, ain't nothin' changed
           That's the way I do my thang!
[Kid Ice]  Let me do it, like nothin' before
           I don't need a friend, I need a whore
           I need a bitch who'll fuck all night
           Take plenty of dick, and the pussy's right
           She'll keep me goin' till she gets me off
           And bring me up, when I'm soft
           Let's get together 'cause it ain't no thang
           You and me, baby, doin' the damn thang!

Chorus

Mr. Mixx:
(Do the damn thang!)  Hey, I'm doin' it, baby!
(Now rub the damn thang!)  Damn right, I'm rubbin' it, baby!
(Kiss the damn thang!)  Mmmmm-kissin'in' it, baby!
(Now do the damn thang!)  Then turn around, baby!
UHH!  UHH!  Now throw the damn thaaAANG!
Throw, throw it!  Throw, the damn thang, baby! {2x}

Chorus

[Come on girl!]  Do, do it!  Do, the damn thang, baby! {2x}</pre>
