You was my girl, we had a good thing
Never thought that things would change
Cuz you would always say, the only one for you
Everything was great, the love we made was great
Never thought I would see the day
When you would slip away, run off with somebody new
I tried to understand what I did wrong to make you leave
But I did the that best I can
There's no other guy who's gonna love you like I did
Now you know that I'm doin' good
Heard the buzz about me blowin' in the hood
You made a mistake
You played the wrong man so:
I won't lose sleep over you
I will not cry over you
I won't save no shit from you
But instead here's what I'll do:
I'll date every girl I see
And make sure that you see me
And you'll regret that you're no longer the one standing next to me
I won't hate on what you do
When you find somebody new
And realize you were a fool
But instead here's what I'll do:
Shake my head with such disgrace
And throw my success in your face
To be back with me is what you wish
I'll make you hate yourself for this
Gonna make you hate yourself
Regret the fact you ever doubted me
At times I felt like we would would never ever part
But I don't really care anymore
Cuz thinkin' 'bout the things that you did u didn't really care
Like when I was with that group Code 5
You used to act like you was by my side
I trusted, I needed you
And all you ever did was mess around with my fam
And talk behind my back
Damn I really hated that
But see now you're gonna pay for that
And live with the fact that we'll never be one again
Unless I choose to, bitch I'ma be cruel too
And let you know that I'm the shit
And that's just somethin' that your gonna have to learn to get used to

I won't lose sleep over you
I will not cry over you
I won't save no shit from you
But instead here's what I'll do:
I'll date every girl I see
And make sure that you see me
And you'll regret that you're no longer the one standing next to me
I won't hate on what you do
When you find somebody new
And realize you were a fool
But instead here's what I'll do:
Shake my head with such disgrace
And throw my success in your face
To be back with me is what you wish
I'll make you hate yourself for this
Nowadays I gotta change my cell phone number every week
Cuz somebody's always hittin' my Nextel askin' me whats goin' on with XL
Mami I know the reason that you reachin' out
Cuz the secret on the street's been leakin' out
Heard different people speakin' 'bout XL
And you seemin' to be left out, oh well
Don't hate me, you should hate yourself
Cuz you tried to play me and you played yourself
And now lately you been feelin' the blues
You was eager to play the game and ain't know the rules
Fouled out which means I found out
You wasn't really ridin' was you?
And now because you, heard that I'm heavy in the streets
You wantin' me back but uh, it's a wrap for you!
I won't lose sleep over you
I will not cry over you
I won't save no shit from you
But instead here's what I'll do:
I'll date every girl I see
And make sure that you see me
And you'll regret that you're no longer the one standing next to me
I won't hate on what you do
When you find somebody new
And realize you were a fool
But instead here's what I'll do:
Shake my head with such disgrace
And throw my success in your face
To be back with me is what you wish
I'll make you hate yourself for this
It's a wrap
So what u need to do is
Take my numbers out your phone
Don't be callin' my crib no more'
Don't be tellin' your friends to tell my friends to tell me nothin
And tell your lil' brother when he see me on the street
Dont be runnin' up to me givin' me dap and all that cuz we ain't cool like that
Oh yeah, remember that time I told you I loved you?
I LIED!</pre>
