Chorus: 
We just rock to the rhythm
We rhyme when we rock
Getting these women sweating and them lift up them frock
We just locked in precise
So we rhyme when we rock
Keeping the music shifting your weight and rocking hard
We just hit it harder
When we rhyme how we rock
Shit's changed but we never gonna stop (come on)
We rock rhymes over beats
Yo, it's just that simple
So just rock to the rhythm
We rhyme 
When we rock

Verse 1: Mas D
I don't know how many years
It's been a long time
Collected my thoughts
Now they ain't all rhymes
If I had it to give or not
I've taken the time to think
Boots on, treading in the current of the drink
Fuckin' fall guy props snatcher
Scholar to street person to thug in a minute cuz
Best believe it, bub
And like the city, I ain't leaving love
Only a hiatus could separate us
Sprinkle out my pocket lint
It's made of debate dust
The cake was great and the crust fabulous
So how we bust?

Verse 2: Rheturik

Status excellence
You possess sad, petulant eyes
Why's that?
You set to give it up, you haven't heard my raps yet
Crept through streets unswept
These unkempt sheets have dealt with tears unwept
Kept cheeks unwet
Built up this inlet from the onset as an outlet
A place to scream and shout at
A place for people to get loud at
I want to rock with you, so where's my crowd at
Hope you didn't get patted down
We got it down pat

Verse 3: Mojo

We slide in the spot
At nine on the dot
My thoughts are interplanetary
Your mind's on the block
You should've left it at home
The nine or the glock
Like Jig said, niggas don't go to shows to get shot now
I pledge allegiance to the stars and stripes
That I see after nights of smoking bongs and pipes, so listen
You could twist up a cigar and fight
But then you might get your eyelid
Buss up shut tight
'Cause we rhyme when we rock...
