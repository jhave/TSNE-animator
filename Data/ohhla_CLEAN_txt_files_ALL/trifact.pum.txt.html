Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro]
We're in the final seconds of this all-star game
It's a tied score, Supastition passes to Wordsworth
Wordsworth with the assist to Pumpkinhead
Two seconds left, and Pumpkinhead hits the trifactor!

[Chorus 2X: various samples scratched]
"They gon' have to mention me among the best"
"You ain't innovatin, you're regurgitatin"
"They gon' have to mention me among the best"
"When I step in the place, you get nervous"

[Pumpkinhead]
You got three dudes on hand that spit it the best
You're small in the game, at best you're reachin my chest
I'm deeper than sex with Tabitha Stevens
Usin a 10-inch long dildo and she ejaculate semen
I mastered the reason, perfected the answer
You're just not believable, like a Mexican Santa
Philly loves me, and I get respect in Atlanta
Pumpkinhead puts it down like Thor with a hammer
My grammar is Grammy status, I'm thankin the Lord
I get to the point like Young Buck's knife at the Vibe Awards
So when I step foot in the arena
You break a sweat like Ruben Studdard, eatin buttered Farina
So your nervousness is fully understandable
You're facin an animal, that'll erase your face with a cannonball
Tough break, how you makin that duck face
when you're Martha Stewart's inmate at Camp Cupcake?

[Chorus]

[Supastition]
Yeah, get nervous...
Just forget about the small talk nonsense and all of it
Niggaz better be ready, I ain't about to call it quits
Though people knew that I was mad innovative
I was caught up in a trap in a bad situation
But I'm glad niggaz waited cause I gradually graduated
Certified and takin rap cats back to basics
I knew that I would shine one of these days
I'm ready as ever, prepared for the comin of age
An unfuck-wit-able flow, though some'll debate
If anybody better tell 'em step in front of the plate
And rest assured, I'm bringin the best, the pure product
like the number one Columbian dealer of narcotics
I should be a household name but y'all caught up
in the buzz and the hype; but niggaz love what I write
And I does what I like despite, whenever somethin's said
The franchise player with Words and Pumpkinhead
Let's go

[Chorus] w/ scratched variations

[Wordsworth]
Yeah, uh-huh, yo.. yeah, uh-huh, yo, yo
You never will win, bein said off the head or the pen
Like a stillborn baby you were dead to begin
Rhyme 'til the record ends
You can't make a mixtape with me, featurin a verse that you edited in
We set it again; start from the top, my margin'll stop
is when the numbers won't revolve on the clock
I shine outside, and provide light outdoors
When I blackout with my rhymes and you white-out yours
My mood behavior, the flows and the moves I made up
Cater to schools, studied by music majors
The rules is straight up to keep you from losin labor
For you and usin paper is like euthanasia
Just heatin up, every day doper I become
Scientists think the Earth is gettin closer to the sun
You got Words and you have the rest
Don't mention me among, mention me AS the best
You know the truth

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

{"Step your lyric game up bitches"}</pre>
