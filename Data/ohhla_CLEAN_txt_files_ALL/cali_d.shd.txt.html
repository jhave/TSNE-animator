(Chorus)
[Nate Dogg]
Every time Ifeel the music
Man I loose it
Every time 
Every time Ifell the music 
Man I loose it
Every time

[Shade Shiest]
Yo, check it, check it out
Yo, uh-huh
Shiest the vet, fresh out your ghetto tape decks
It's me and Nate back at it with another for your neck
Another for a check (means), Another for the set (green)
Is what I need to get, Cali's where I wanna be
And I ain't got to lie about the hood or the city
Shade straight from the sue of Jerry up where it's shitty
I got a mouth on me, farthest thing from being pretty
As I cash a check compliments of Nate and Dogg Pound-dation
Shade move the feet of every nation
Kids got the beast now, Trey about to eat now
We both got a plan to leave them haters in they sleep now
Soakin' in the sweat from the heat from the speaks now

(Chorus)

[Nate Dogg]
There ain't, no way I'm missing my call
Suddenly fall fucking with y'all
Homie can't you; see me trying to get paid
Everyday any kinda way
There ain't, no way you taking my bang
Let your ass think your pussy don't stank
Hell no, you got it all wrong
You need to move on, I'm singing my song
Tell me, can you feel the beat
Is it, moving your feet?
Cause it, surely moves me
Well then, ok let's be on our way
Shade Shiest and big Nate
Just let the beat bang

(Chorus)</pre>
