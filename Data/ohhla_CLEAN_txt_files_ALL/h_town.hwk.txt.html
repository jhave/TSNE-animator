[Hook]
Ery'body in the club, get crunk
Move side to side, and do the H-Town stomp
Ery'body in the club, get loose
If you feeling good, and you on that Grey Goose
Ery'body, in the club, get crunk
Move side to side, and do the H-Town stomp
Ery'body in the club, get crunk get pumped
Smoke a blunt get drunk, and do the H-Town stomp

[H.A.W.K.]
Now ery'body in the club, here's your chance
To go and participate, in this brand new dance
This dance, is a little advanced
And you can even do it in tight pants, let's go now
Start body rocking, side to side
Slide your feet, from the left to the right then stomp
In H-Town, we gon do it with pride
But this dance gon be nationwide, get crunk
Get crunk with it, you can even stunt with it
Do a jump with it, but don't forget to stomp with it
Smoke a blunt with it, go on get drunk with it
Get crunk with it, go on shake your rump with it
And I'm really, not a dancing dude
But this track'll make your body move, put you in a groove
Now this track, will make you lose your cool
So go on ahead and act a god damn fool, and do the H-Town stomp

[Hook]

[H.A.W.K.]
While ery'body in the club, getting tipsy
I'm trying to get do', like Eminem and 50
And I ain't even, on Aftermath
I'm just a nigga that's after cash, so I'ma show my ass
I'm representing, for the Lone Start State
And I couldn't wait, to put a end to all this hate
Big H.A.W.K., about to set things straight
Make some'ing shake, as soon as this record break now
Look at here now, I'm making thangs clear now
It's my year now, I'm coming from the rear now
Can't nan nigga, block my shine
I'll smash an offensive line, and that's the bottom line
I'm a nigga, that's built to grind
And y'all boys gon give me mine, gon give me mine
I done patiently, waited my time
Now it's time to put my damn foot down, and do the H-Town stomp

[Hook]

[H.A.W.K.]
Now I'ma take it, where it all begin
That's the 12000 block, of the Dead End
I was still, bout my bread then
Seen dead men, and many friends go to the Penn
And for my niggaz, doing time in the Penn
I can't wait, till I see y'all again
See your boy, about to set a new trend
Once I get a few radio spins, here we go now
Please believe that, I'm waiting on some feedback
Where the weed at, homeboy I need that
Where my G's at, my niggaz with the cheese at
Girl that booty fat, go on let me squeeze that
And this rap shit, it ain't no comp
I'm not Ashton, but chumps get punked
Get out of line, your ass might get jumped
All on the ground your ass gon get stomp, with this H-Town stomp
