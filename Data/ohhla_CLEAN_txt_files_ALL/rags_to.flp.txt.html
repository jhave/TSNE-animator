[Verse 1]

[Lil' Flip] I push a drop-top
[Will-Lean] I push a Maserati

[WL] In my black Denali
[LF] You know the ladies love us
[WL] You know the niggaz hate us
[LF] We learn to make the money
[WL] Don't let the money make us
[LF] We can't fuck with you fakers
[WL] We keep a gat for jackers
[LF] Them shots will hit ya ass
[WL] BOOM! Harder than a linebacker
[LF] I got a chip on my shoulder
[WL] I got three clips in my holster
[LF] Let's get it on nigga
[WL] Before I spit ya dome nigga
[LF] I'm nominated this year
[WL] We need a Grammy nigga
[LF] I'm at the Source Awards
[WL] Down in Miami nigga
[LF] I used to be broke
[WL] Now we paid in full
[LF] We back to back (back to back)
[WL] Like the Chicago Bulls
[LF] We came a long way
[WL] You shouldn't have made a left (made a left)
We made a right (made a right)
[LF] You went the wrong way
Now we coming up

[LF] We got our own weed
[WL] Y'all still borrowin' smokes

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

[WL] I fuck with mad hoes
[LF] You already know
[WL] I got three chicks in Pensacola

[WL] And we thuggin
[LF] Rollin' on dubs
[WL] I can't quit like Snoop
[LF] We smokin' our stuff
[WL] Nigga, you not hard
[LF] You just a pop star
[WL] You sweet in the middle
[LF] You remind me of a Pop Tart
[WL] You had a head start
[LF] But you in last place
[WL] That's what you niggaz get
[LF] For movin' at a fast pace
[WL] We number one for real-uh
[LF] Just fire up the killa
[WL] And if you wanna show
[LF] Just wire us the skrilla
[WL] We came to bring the pain
[LF] And Johnny bring the chain
[WL] What about the watch?
[LF] We got special rocks
[WL] Cause we got extra glocks
[LF] With a few extra shots

[LF] And we extra hot
