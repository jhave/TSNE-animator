[Eazy-E]
Now I'mma Break it down and tell a story
about a nigga in the wrong territory
Sharon and Shide is who he had to meet
he made a right turn down the wrong street
now whatta whatta whatta whatta pitty
a new jack in my muthafuckin' city

[Dr. Dre]
Compton that is 
they say it's niggaz pimpin' 
gangsta limpin'

[Eazy-E]
But back back to the nitty gritty
bout this nigga slippin' in my fuckin' city
by the time that he realized that he fucked up
the stupid muthafucka got a foot in his ass
now this is how the story goes
don't you ever bring your ass 
in my neiborhood fuckin' my hoes
cause they my hoes and I knows 
when they've been fucked

[]
"Who's ready to get up and do my thang!"
"Doin' it you know!"

[Eazy-E]

and tell how this kid went from right to riches
now he's drivin' fancy cars gettin' bitches galore

[Dr. Dre impersonating Mack Romey]

shoes plad pants and nappy ass hat under

but he can do that cause he's that nigga
from Eazy Street on the road to riches

story goes and if the nigga stays up you
