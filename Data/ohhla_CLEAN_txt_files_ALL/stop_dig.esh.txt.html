Song:   Stop Diggin on Da D-L
Typed by: ringmaasta@hotmail.com

Can I dig ya on the D-L
Pure satisfaction
Tricks be real
Time for some action
I'm one of those niggas that don't smile
But fuck that pussy like it's goin out of style
For a while I've been gone, but I'm back
I kept the super sperm trapped in the jimmy hat
I gotta bitch I been dyin to fuck
So many niggas tryin to fuck
In line to fuck
Baby girl, you got it goin on
Hit the motel, to the break of dawn
Late night with my late night freak
Nigga on the creep once the city falls asleep
I like to dig these hoes, dig this here
I bust a nut in a magic trick then disappear
But you still unaware, cause you blind hoe
You out yo mind hoe
So stop diggin on the down low

(Chorus X2)
He wanna dig it,dig it
She wanna dig it,dig it
We wanna dig it on the down low

Now it's alot of hoes in my city
And this shit's true
Everybody's fuckin
But who's fuckin who
I gotta watch the bitch with the big, fat butt
Cause she want the nigga with the big, fat nuts
A man is measured by the things that he has
And if you ain't got shit
Well I guess you ain't shit, unless
Yo game is tight
Yo name is right, wrong you can get the bitch for the night
Cause cash rules everything Around Me
Money make a bitch pull her panties down, G
And yo, you just don't know
It could be your hoe, yo
So stop diggin on the down low

(Chorus X2)

Niggas wanna dig what I dug when I dig it
Some wanna squig what I squg when I squig it
So dig it
I'm wicket
And ain't nothin like cheap sex,love is free
But a bitch gotta pay me
Ain't nothin goin on but the rent
Love's like time cause it all gets spent
On bullshit day in and day out
Some hoes think trickin won't play out
Now who's that nigga bust a gang of nuts
In a gang of sluts
But you still don't hear me, though
Relax your mind and tricks unwind
Check the Morris Day, cause it's time
Stop diggin on the down low

(Chorus X2)
