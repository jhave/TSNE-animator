Right now if you raising some children that don't belong to you
But you know you're taking care of them
Please report on the dancefloor, let's go now
Do the stepfather dance (to the right)
Do the stepfather dance (to the left)
Do the stepfather dance
Baby mama don't hurt nobody, come on

[Wyclef]
I ain't that baby's daddy, I treat him like he's my own
But sometimes sit and wonder how can I father another man's son (oh)
When argument breaks in the pad
Shorty wanna scream 'I ain't his real dad' now
I may not be your father
But I'm the closest thing to him

[Wyclef]
Girl I love you
And ain't a thing that I wouldn't do for you
You my boo and we be sticking just like glue
But your kid's got me losing my mind
Wanna know if I want you
And if I do then you just gotta come to
Now the family be fighting through hard times
But I'm gon' treat them like they're mine

[Wyclef]
I ain't that baby's daddy, I treat him like he's my own
But sometimes sit and wonder how can I father another man's son (oh)
When argument breaks in the pad
Shorty wanna scream 'I ain't his real dad' now
I may not be your father
But I'm the closest thing to him

[Wyclef]
Fresh pair of Jordan's you had it
When you want a Playstation you had it (Vendetta)
First day of school you had it
Even when I didn't have it
Once upon a time, not long ago
Before the dreads, when I had the afro
When in school I used to pass the love notes
If you like me check yes if not check no
Flip the page now everything changed
The kid don't even have my last name
Sometime I feel like I'm paying child support
Someone please call people's court

[Wyclef]
I ain't that baby's daddy, I treat him like he's my own
But sometimes sit and wonder how can I father another man's son (oh)
When argument breaks in the pad
Shorty wanna scream 'I ain't his real dad' now
I may not be your father
But I'm the closest thing to him

[Wyclef] (Redman)
No, (come on) I can't seem to take this pressure no more (come on)
And ? told me young man that life's too short
So leave ya kids at home, meet me on the dancefloor

[Redman]
Yo Wyclef you a wild boy, check it out

[Wyclef] (Redman)
Do the stepfather dance, to the right
Do the stepfather dance, to the left
Do the stepfather dance (yeah)
Jersey's in the house

[Redman] (Wyclef)
We go, Redman, ganjah the smoke
Listen to the sounds of my nigga funk doc, oh
Wyclef, you know you rule hip-hop, oh
Yo let me handle my bidness (go ahead)
If you love your sons like I do, dress like you and
Air's on his feet, and shinin' his jewels
Brag when he get back to school
Saying my daddy bought me Vendetta 2 for Gamecube
You know kids that try to get fast
That's when I open up a can of whoop ass
Listen, I'm the boss, if you do what I say
Like Nas, the world is yours, let's go

[Wyclef]
I ain't that baby's daddy (Redman)
I treat him like he's my own (we in the house)
But sometimes sit and wonder how can I father another man's son (oh)
When argument breaks in the pad (aha)
Shorty wanna scream 'I ain't his real dad' now (aha)
I may not be your father (ey)
But I'm the closest thing to him (come on)

[Wyclef]
I ain't that baby's daddy (I ain't that baby's daddy)
I treat him like he's my own (like he's my own)
But sometimes sit and wonder how can I father another man's son (oh)
When argument breaks in the pad (breaks in the pad)
Shorty wanna scream 'I ain't his real dad' now (you ain't my dad)
I may not be your father (aha)
But I'm the closest thing to him (yeah)

[Wyclef]
Do the stepfather dance
Do the stepfather dance (eh)
Do the stepfather dance</pre>
