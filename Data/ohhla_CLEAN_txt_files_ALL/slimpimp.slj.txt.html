[Soulja Slim]
Yep, I need a top boss bitch in my factory, ya heard me, my boss bitch

They say dat we was of tha same kind &amp; ain't lyin'
But at dat time I did shit to fuck ya like you was mine
Turn tha ghetto bitch boss &amp; let her floss
It don't make dollars it don't make sense dat pussy cost
Break it off &amp; when you get it brang it to me
Split it down tha middle, you get 2 I get 3
I wouldn't call it pimpin', they thank pimpin' played out
Still tha same cept Soulja Slim shit layed out
Put cha on your feet to keep ya neat, nigga speak
Not only dat she make a nigga wanna eat
Nigga tweak for a big booty &amp; a smile
Might hurt me later on but don't hurt now
Sendin' good pussy on this mission to fuck this faker
Figure maker, perpatraitor, a soulja hater
Thank he boss cause he fuckin' my ghetto hoe
But I'm off in his baby momma &amp; tha nigga never know
An I'm slick side doggin' it at random
Met her at Bayou Classic, when Southern played Gramblin'
She was pushin' yo Expedition, tell me if I'm wrong?
Tha bitch tinted, grill fitted, sittin' on chrome
Followed me home in yo shit, tore tha pussy up
Bust a nut, left a soulja rag in tha truck
remember dat, dat was me, actually
I did it on G-P for tha dog nigga up in me

[Chorus 2X: Soulja Slim]
All hoes get layed, boss bitches get paid
I see somethin' in ya, we can blow up like tha world trade
Slang dat ass, make dat cash, brang it back to me
You be tha top boss bitch up in my factory

[Soulja Slim]
Now back to my hoe I lie to, said I die for,
My whole life I thank I cried enough
Still hype enough to keep my paper steady comin'
Heads up, where they at? I hear 'em drummin'
I'm hotter than tha gun dat killed Martin Luther King
That why tha fuck I can't floss on Narizen
Dat light green sticky sticky got my vision blurry
Head buried underground, feel like I smoked a pound
Shake down, give it up, drop it like it's hot
Me &amp; tha Bossalinie close &amp; open up shop
It's understood dat you ain't nothin' but my boss bitch
Double cross me get cha head knocked off bitch
To tha river ya go buck naked wit out no clothes
Bullet lodged to ya dome, bust open asshole
Disrespect tha code get ya self fucked over
Got cha pysched all tha way out there behind Soulja
I played them hoes, I'm a cold blooded ass nigga
I done it to ya girl, look here don't get mad nigga
I done dat bad nigga but fuck you know what's happ'n
I lay ya down, I'm a dog here besides rappin'

[Chorus]</pre>
