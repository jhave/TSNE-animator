[Timbaland]
Dance with me... yeah, tango with me (repeat 4X)

[Shaunte]
In suspension like a sports car
Shaunte got big lips and handlebars
Put it on Tim like a porno star
Run back the tape in the VCR

[Timbaland]
I'm comin baby like the big black, Kahuna
I wish you woulda humped me just a little sooner
Now rich, like silver-spooner
Now here's the finger now I got you moonin
I wish you woulda did that two years ago (go, go, go)
Let me feel the body hit the skins yo (yo-yo, yo, yo)
Now you see a brother makin a little dough (dough-dough, dough, dough)
I really hate that mess, but I love you yo (yo-yo, yo.. uh-huh)

Chorus: all together

Oooooooohhh, luv 2 luv 2 luv ya, luv ya, luv ya! (repeat 4X)

[Timbaland (talking over the chorus)]
I love you baby
I love you, uh-huh, I love you baby
I love you, I love you baby
I love you, uh-huh, Maganoo..

[Magoo]
I dream bout Leah Lando, make all the luchiano
And girls with condos, Chanel with Guitano
Girl my persono, I share like Sonny Bono
Black and white keys, lay girls on my piano
Me, Missy and Timbo, rap in any tempo
Huckleberry Finn, Magoo the South Pimple
Caught up in my lingo, be not girl, I'm Bingo
Help I see a Beatle, cool out that's only Ringo
Missy sang a jangle as I commence to tango
Ginuwine ridin on a Pony, put Monie in the Middle
Check the riddle, got your girl pants hot a little
Thinkin that she dime when you only just a nickel
Take a tickle, cause your man, pickle green and resentful
Mag and two-ohh, from down South and here go
Black house shoes, my Kangol to match
Pimp crack game, take all your scratch
Girl, I'm the P see me on TV
Beep Beep, hook me up witcha girl CeCe
Female, lookie here, I'm Chip you Dale
Let me get one kiss, just don't go tell
You so obsurd I thought you heard
If you don't know, the bird is the word
Yes the bird bird bird, the bird is the word
The bird bird bird, the bird is the word

Chorus

[Timbaland (talking over chorus)]
Shhhhh, aooww-oooh, I love you baby
Uh-huh, I love you, uh-huh, uh-huh uh-huh
What?  Uh-huh, I love you, say what say what?
Is you in, or is you ain't, my baby... ahhh!

[Shaunte]
See I don't stop like good dick
Skypager's hotness when you need a fix
Big girls don't cry we take all of it
Doggystyle like George and the Parliament
Feel me now, see my lovin got you bedstrucken
Head is stuck in, the pillowcase suckin, Shaunte still handcuffin
Just me and you cause I'ma rock it all night
You can go fast or slow
but I'ma tell you when it's good and right, uh-huh

[Timbaland]
Look at you girl, talkin trash
Now I'll come around and swing that ass
Make you bend over, uhh, backwards, call me master
Have you sayin Tim do it faster and faster
Now I'm the man with the power
I get booty calls fifteen after every hour
So don't try to take it personal
I gotta get the cash, now you got to go, what?

Chorus

[Timbland (talking over chorus)]
Oooh, I love you baby

Go, go, go
Yo-yo, yo, yo
Dough-dough, dough, dough
Yo-yo, yo... uh-huh
(repeat 2X)
