[Verse One: Trick Daddy]
Anybody wanna motherfucking die, come see I
Who me? T-double D nigga
That's right that's motherfucking me nigga (huh)
And got damn it if I said it, I motherfuckin meant it
If it was fully I motherfucking spit it, fuck whoever I offended
Hold on!  Wait one motherfucking minute
Y'all ho's y'all know how the game go
Fuck everyday never hit the same ho
From M-I-A that's where I stay baby
Bout money and I don't even play baby
If a nigga ever was to go broke, click click
Y'all niggas seen this shit before
Real niggas know how to make a way
I make niggas who creep stay the fuck away

Hook: JV

You can't fuck with me or my dogs
Representing double S
Haters fuck y'all

You don't run shit over here

Cause we can both die right now
I don't fuck with you
So don't fuck with me

I'm just trying to get my shit together
I'm making money with my click forever
We all fam and we stick together

[Verse Two: Trick Daddy]
Huh, see back in the days before niggas like me
There was niggas like you infuriating my crew
I got sick of this shit
Say one day here's what a nigga gon' do
Staking out in hummers we spittin on 'em
All hating ass niggas fuck it we'll kill 'em
I'm sick of 'em
And they can't do shit for 'em
(They wanna go to war)
Oh well I got big guns
Its T-double-D y'all
Okay my AK's on full y'all
This one here on me dog
But the next time no cameras no TV dog
If you a real nigga just like me dog
And you like living just like me dog
You know when you rap niggas blow up and don't show up
And that ain't even me dog

Hook 2x: JV

You can't fuck with me or my dogs
Representing double S
Haters fuck y'all

Tout guns with
You don't run shit over here

Cause we can both die right now

So don't fuck with me

I'm just trying to get my shit together
I'm making money with my click forever
We all fam and we stick together

[Verse Three: JV]
It's a whole lot of niggas out here
Don't wanna see me JV flowin, Hennesey pouring
Knowing where a nigga came from, where a nigga going
Take a look, I'm the best thing showing, blowing
Smoking on the best thing growing
Tighten up
You don't wanna be for a nigga like me 
See that's where ya slip
Now I gotta slide in the clip
Flip, take another sip
Bust ya in ya lip with the gat
Man I don't play like that
We taking this shit back, right now
The game the same, the whole damn thing
Oh naw I ain't playin witcha man, I'll be there when I get there 
Oh shit yeah
Ain't nothing else finna be the same nigga

So don't fuck with me
