[Introduction:]
This piece was constructed
For the cats who even had the audacity to think a derogatory thought about myself
I shall not wait, be patient, nor sit any longer
Here, Fly come

[Chorus]
Here I come nigga
(And I'm coming to get cha)
Nowhere to run nigga
(And I'm coming to get cha)
It wont be fun my nigga
(when I'm coming to get cha
Hoe I'm coming to get cha
Bitch I'm coming to get cha)

You better run my nigga
(When I'm coming to get cha)
Go get your gun my nigga
(Cause I'm coming to get cha)
The deal is done my nigga
(And I'm coming to get cha
Hoe I'm coming to get cha
Bitch I'm coming to get cha)

[Verse 1]
Here comes the mister bitch
And I'm coming to get cha
No more balls and chains
So hoe now I can get wit cha
First you cough
Next you cold nigga
Now all the way out
You sold nigga
You know what's funny to me
I know your ass remember
Every time we hit a spot
I was surprised when I'm
Always doin my job
Ae yo we mob
Minnie mae raised
THE UNIVERSAL HEARTHROB
I walk the walk
See I was born with it
A lot of talk, Bitch
You was born scary
Shootin shit more deadly
Than the lead that was in my belly
Nightmares on your street
Like I am Kruger Freddy
So grab your bitch and hold her tight like she your favorite teddy
I come through with the crew
And leave you real messy
Ae yo I tried my best to even deal wit cha
Now here I come to get cha

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
The tension I'm sending
Will leave a lemon heartbroken
You just a reject who's nonprofit and penny-loping
When up in soakin and floatin across the muddy river
Is where you be better off
Dont fuck off wit me nigga!
How reluctant you be
To not come step to me
With all this hatin you doin
On my M 2 3
Act like you Do Not Know
About the Way We Roll
All those who oppose
Ms Minnie's Child of Gold	
Sho nuff Fly gon buck
On every mic I clutch
No matter when or where	
See Fly don't care too much
I just don't give a fuck
Expect no mercy from me
Tuck your tail, hit the path
And start runnin sonny
Try and get away from me
But boy you know I'm coming
I comprehend what you sending
So Flizy coming, gunnin
And I'm not gunning around ya
I got plans on hitting ya
Matter of fact I'm splitting ya
When I come to get cha

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You bitches might not be ready
For the final round
Cocked aimed straight up loaded
And ready to put it down
Put some holes in you hoes
Like I am many rounds
Here I come
And you hate the way that Lil' Billy clowns
Knocking down your stack of bricks
Like Fly a steel ball	
And more than 200 pounds
Will make a big fall
I say fuck all y'all
And yo I mean this shit
I'm bout to ball y'all
And flat foot run this bitch
Flat foot bump this bitch
Face first dump this bitch
Parkway stomp this bitch
Cause you a lounging bitch
Betcha Flizy wont miss
I beat cha hit by hit
Come get you some of this
But you don't want none of this
You'd rather smell like piss
Or either look like shit
Or whine and cry big bitch
Or just ride my dick
Ae yo I tried my best to get my meals wit cha
Now here I come to get cha!!!
