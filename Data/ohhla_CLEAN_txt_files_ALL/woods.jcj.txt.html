Album:  Stay Trippy
Song:   The Woods
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I wanna dedicate this song to that special chick
(Did you hear that?)
Trippy chick...

[Chorus]
When we go walking in the woods
Nobody can hear us
And you could be as freaky as you should
I love you at your weirdest
Unleash the animal, hear my mating call
I want you to be fearless
When we go walking in the woods
A natural experience
Go ahead...

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Hey baby let's fly away to a private place
So far away we get high and feel that we out of space
She keep looking back at it, we keep grinding like jack rabbits
All she want is this pipe, I turn her into a crack addict
Ain't nothing that a nigga can't afford
Louie, Gucci or Chanel, I'll buy the store
You and me on a new beach, sippin' champagne
Making love on a island resort
No need to pack luggage, hope on the jet like "fuck it"
I got everything you want and you need, I guarantee you'll love it
She the baddest woman you ever seen, she belong with King Magazine
You might seen her on a movie screen, she's so dope now I'm her fiend
Just thinking about her I don't need a buzz
We party hard, we don't need a club
Bring your passport we're making love in Persia on a Persian rug

[Chorus]
When we go walking in the woods
Nobody can hear us
And you could be as freaky as you should
I love you at your weirdest
Unleash the animal, hear my mating call
I want you to be fearless
When we go walking in the woods
A natural experience
Go ahead...

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I got a Rolls-Royce baby that's yours
I got a private jet baby that's yours
I'm balling baby, what's mine is yours
You can have all that and even more
I got a black card, go on a shopping spree
I buy you so much ice, girl you can ski
Your old man tryna lock you down
Come with Juicy J and you'll be free
She got her own, she independent
We at the lake, she skinny dipping
In the hotel we wake the neighbors
They knocking like Jehovah's Witness
Girl we can kick every chop karate
Out on my yaught we go island shopping
Back to my suit, ten grand a night
Just me and you, it's a private party
She's sent from heaven, mayne
She needs wings on her
I might have to put a ring on her
Damn she so bad, damn she so thick
I wonder how she fit jeans on it
For me she unleash her inner animal when we meet
And she a lady off in the streets
But a beast when we're in the sheets

[Chorus]
When we go walking in the woods
Nobody can hear us
And you could be as freaky as you should
I love you at your weirdest
Unleash the animal, hear my mating call
I want you to be fearless
When we go walking in the woods
A natural experience
Go ahead...</pre>
