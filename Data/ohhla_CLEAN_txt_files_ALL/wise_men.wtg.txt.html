[RZA]
Christians say that you can study all day
pray all day, and chant all day
But you get to heaven faster
if you hang with the wise men
Yeah I would say once you got inspired spark
Y'know, you strive, to, y'know
You gotta put, y'know you gotta keep puttin wood on it as they say
Right? Keep it burnin or whatever
You gotta find a way to keep it burnin
But then there's the optimum side of it
That's the burnin fire that's burnin but it don't burn
Knahmean? Just in life, like the sun
You know the sun is seen, like that
But it's like a eternal sun that
that it is on regardless, you just on
You just free from, y'know
Shit don't work on you no more
