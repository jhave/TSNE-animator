[T.I.] (Too $hort)
Ay shawty
(Whussup playa?)
Ay, you 'memba dat broad we met back on da road last year, bout '99?
(Da one up in NYC?)
Nah, nah, not the one from New York, I 'memba her too doe
I'm talkin bout the one from L.A.
lil bad bitch I met in da mall wit da big azz
(Oh, oh, dat bitch)
Here wha she said
(Whussup?)

[Chorus]
I'll meet you at the hotel, we can fuck all night
Do me how you want to, I won't tell nobody
(Shit, let'z do it... where u at?)
I said, meet me at the hotel, we can fuck all night
Do me how you want to, I won't tell nobody
(Shit baby, keep yo mouth shut we can do it, sho nuff)

[Verse 1] (T.I.)
One day in L.A., I'm at the mall
Pickin me up a coupla pairs of silk drawls
And I ran into this fine azz well built broad
She was in hard from a long way
So I'm finna go on swing shawty way
Just like da song say, cuz I don't play
Miss lady built like a amazon
A 5'9", light brown, wit some sandals on
Da kinda azz dat make you wanna grab a handle on
And fuck her all day in da hallway with the candlez on
So I wave, and I speak and conversation coo
She asked my name, where I'm from and why I talk the way I do?
I said "Cuz I ain't from round hea, I'm from Atlanta shawty, but anywayz
We can still get togetha, cuz I'm gon be hea fo a coupla dayz"
And then she say, she never been ta Georgia, she was dyin ta visit
Well, I'm in room 312, at the Sofatel, I'm sho that they listed
She got the digits, say she like me, and that we can be friends
If I ain't welcome shawty, don't invite me, ain't no need ta pretend
I'm wanna lick on ya neck, kiss ya earz, and make yo knee bend
Put ya azz in positionz you never thought you'd be in
Now, I'm tellin you shawty, fuckin wit me, like divin of deep end
Have you sneekin, creepin in Georgia, freak on the weekend

Repeat [Chorus]

[Verse 2](T.I.)
This time, it was me n KP, in NYC
On some Quevo and Hennessy, and 2 sweets with two freaks
Some of da baddest thangz in Times Square wit some long hairz, cute feet
One of'em say she wanna drive me to Coney Island so she can show me the new beach
Couldn't nobody ride wit me doe, cuz da car only had 2 seatz
Lil' cute freak, in da Z3, remind me of one of my hoez in da GC
Told me her name was Sharell but all of her friendz call her Cici
Say she up hea goin ta NYU, but originally she frum DC
Say she'd love ta freak me, reminisce while listenin to mah CD
Lay me out on the beach feed me strawberriez n kiwi
Shawty say she like wha she see, can't wait ta get down hea n see me
Round Freaknik, say soon az you hit da city all you gotta do iz beep me
And let me know whut itz finna be, the Four Seasons or the Embassy
Get a voice mail round 10 ta 3, and then wha she said ta me...

Repeat [Chorus]

Tell'em how you did the broad shawty
(I fucked the bitch... and forgot the bitch)

[Verse 3](Too $hort)
I'm havin fun... gettin pussy on the run
Bitches comin to mah room, tryna make me cum
In *Cleveland* last weekend, O-High Hoe, whuz really goin on?
She said "Stick it down my throat"
A lotta yall married... to mah ex trampz
She shouldn't worry, I sent the bitch to sex camp
Taught her how to fuck, she made you fall in love
I fucked her real tough, now you can't get enough
Knockin on mah door fo yo hoe, das no game pimp
I fucked all them bitchez DMX was namin
Fuckin hoez from Milly, bitchez out in Philly
Puerto Rican, Dominican, New York pussy, ya feel me
I been nationwide since '88
So don't clown when I'm around, keep yo lady straight
Cuz I'ma... beat her pussy down in the worst way
You waited six months, and I fucked her on the first date, at the Hotel

(T.I. &amp; Too $hort talkin through Chorus)
Meet me at the hotel, we can fuck all night
(Hoe, don't tell nobody... BIATCH!!!)
Do me how you want to, I won't tell nobody
(That'z right... we runnin' up in deze hoez...
Trackstarz baby, real playaz, ballin in da ATL)
I said, meet me at the hotel, we can fuck all night
Do me how you want to, I won't tell nobody
(You betta ask yo bitch about us
Take the game from Timbucktoo to the Kalimazoo
You know how a playa do...
... and one mo thang baby...
Check out time... Arivaderchi, capeesh? Bishhh...)</pre>
