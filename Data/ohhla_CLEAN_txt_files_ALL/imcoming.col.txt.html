Song:   I'm Coming Home
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
tell the World I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
tell the World I'm coming

Back where I belong
I've never felt so strong eh
feeling like there's nothing that I can't try
and if you feel me put your hands high, high, high, hey
and if you feel me put your hands high, high, hey

This is my story this is my song
if you aint got the heart, don't attempt to try this at home
it's just a poem from a man once living wrong
now I'm in the zone, tell the World I'm coming home
been a long time coming, been a long time coming
this song feel like the greatest of all time coming
cause I do it B-I-G, I remember we would be high
who'd have thought we'd be running rap when we was knee high
to appreciate the sun you gotta know what rain is
or cause I'm famous you don't gotta know what pain is
but I bounce back, would ya look at that
I take my spot at the top and I aint looking back

[Chorus]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
tell the World I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
tell the World I'm coming

Hey, confusion like I was losing my mind
but one thing I never lose is my grind
my closet need a lot of cleaning now
I can't sleep cause I dont like the sh-t I dream about
hey Dear Lord please help me get the demons out
and then help me get my genius out
and get back to what I had
if my good's outweigh my bads, do you think my mistakes is gon even out (even out)
I guess try and see, it's on my diary, I'm living for my kids
now they is just as fly as me
talk well, wonder if Andre Harrell knew how great I would be when he fired me

[Chorus x2]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
tell the World I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
tell the World I'm cominghome</pre>
