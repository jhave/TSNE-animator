Song:   Dat Feel
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
When I smoke it
I'm trying to get that feel
When I roll it
I'm trying to get that feel
When I light it
I'm trying to get that feel
I'm trying to get that feel
When I roll it
I'm trying to get that feel
I'm trying to get that feel

[Verse 1]
Floating on that kush while I brainstorm
Looking for a cloud to write my main mourn
Blow that weed con this trend strong
The motivation behind this damn song
I'm trying to get that feel you know that's piffa pill
Vanilla dutch stuffed with that cali kil
I'm talking that bubble kush with that warner label
Drift off in the sleep nobody can save you than I
Fall into a deep abyss off them trippy sticks
Dope don me quarters a better to make you feel and shit
Smoke whatever vein you like bitch inhale my piff
Laugh on the dispensary I'm on that potent shit
Crack a fifty box and I OZ with my potent clique
Then I rap a spliff saying where I rap the chip
Brown skin fire thing I grind the hit
Stoner life you know I keep one lid

[Chorus]
When I smoke it
I'm trying to get that feel
When I roll it
I'm trying to get that feel
When I light it
I'm trying to get that feel
I'm trying to get that feel
When I roll it
I'm trying to get that feel
I'm trying to get that feel

[Verse 2]
Roll it let that kush burn
I'm in the Matrix Larry Fishburn
Exotic buds I'm rolling up
That loud shit my lungs hurt
Since youth been smoking heavy
I do the source in that old chevy
Kill shit like Wayne Perry
Lynch Cinky my eyes cherry
All buds no sticks and seeds
Like my package all I'm green
TAC I'm a fucking fiend
Except hennesy I don't do the lean
Lemonhaze OG, sour D I don't do the green
Sell dime smoke out the pee
Lungs filled with smoke like a chimney
Heard your songs got shit trashed
Crushing buds on your LP
Dre talking about detox
I'm smoking till the death of me
Pop a little of that pow and this
The sack on me I smoke it quick
Dutch master full of piff
Cyphing with this model chick
Out the OZ this Mary Jane keep controlling me
Tryin to get that feel my truth smoke is on the deal
Wrapping doobies up smoking till a nigga stop
Shit ill I'm a stone off a real

Potent [x8]
Welcome to a potent life
Welcome to a stoner life
You in the world of a potent stoner life

[Outro]
Potent department
Super lid extra coasting
Floating on that extra strong
Girl ash is cash bad
We smoking out and have sex stoned
My marijuana comes from Oregon
Somebody's basement it was crowded on
Up but excel on
A cut boot steps beyond
That bullshit of them boys stealing
It's the potent department and they know derailing
Trained nigga, lame nigga
Put your bitch in my game nigga
We shake it in charge but operate it
But because that pussy been slain nigga
On the low down your girl dirty
And that's a fucking shame nigga</pre>
