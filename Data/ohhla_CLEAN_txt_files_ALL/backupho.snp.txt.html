Goldie Loc, remember this last shit
All these bitches wanting their bills paid
And just calling niggaz scrubs and shit
Shit we need to slide over 99 before the R2G
You know we got to come back on these hoes my nigga... That's real
With the DPGC Dogghouse Style... Eastside up, check this out babe

[Hook]
When I wake up in the morning
You give me breakfast in my bed
And when I need a little loving
You know you're quick to give me head

[Goldie Loc]
I woke up, gave it a good stretch
Call my nigga so I can see what's next
Big movie racking Goldie Loc slack-a-lackin'
Bump head in the morning had a nigga crack-a-lackin
So I call my nigga Clean Right
I know he gon have some bomb hoes tonight
But I got to get this work done don't trip the Loc is all one
Watch me get this second ??? bread with my ??? on
He tried to get with the money I was making
Tripping on my tricks now watch how they behaving

[Snoop Dogg]
You know what? Kiss me and I'll kiss you back

[Hook]
When I wake up in the morning
You give me breakfast in my bed
And when I need a little loving
You know you're quick to give me head

[Snoop Dogg]
It's six am she won't pay him but she will pay me
OG baby, baby on bullshit most of the time
Hoes did it fine, ain't she's like Ginuwine
I ain't got time to be messing around
Let's hit the hotel and straight put it down
You do me and I do you back
That's how a pimp player do it like that
I met you at the club so it couldn't be love
Come to find out you the motherfucker scrub on the dub
And now you wanna get in my tub and get a back scrub
With Snoop d-o-dub?
Hold on, put your clothes on, bitch you ain't bout to get your doughs on
Go in the kitchen and hook me up something to eat
And put the TV on BET
And toss me a LA Times and roll one of them dimes
And make sure the radio works
And get me some orange juice with the ice in a cup
I know I'm the man damn but I'm a motherfuckin pimp and I don't give a fuck
And when I wake up in the morning, bitch you know what's up

[Hook]
When I wake up in the morning
You give me breakfast in my bed
And when I need a little loving
You know you're quick to give me head
You're the sweetest hoe I know
And I'll never let you go
Ooh ooh (ooh ooh)
You gon be my back up hoe
Ooh ooh (ooh ooh)
You gon be my back up hoe</pre>
