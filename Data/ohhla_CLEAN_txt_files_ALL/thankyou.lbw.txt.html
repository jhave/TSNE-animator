Uhh, uhh

[Lil' Bow Wow] (J.D.)
Yeah, uh-huh (So So Def), uhh
   {*Jagged Edge harmonizing*}
If you ever bought a tape (yeah)
Purchased a CD (uh-huh)
Or a piece of vinyl (c'mon)
DJ'd my record (Rock, rock on)
Promoted my record (tell 'em)
I wanna thank y'all man from the bottom of my heart (that's right)
Secondly, I wanna dedicate this song to y'all man
cause without y'all, there is no me (c'mon)

[Lil' Bow Wow]
I could never turn my back on y'all (uhh)
Cause y'all put me where I'm at so when ya call
I'll be there, just like that (just like that)
Signin autographs, givin deps to all my folks
Tellin little kids, don't follow these dopes
See, I'ma keep barkin' long as y'all bark wit' me (WOOF!)
Y'all know the website, all y'all gotta do is hit me
As much as the girls like me, you would think it make the fellas sick
(yeah) but they be right wit 'em singin, not missin a lick
Hair braided, rockin somebody's jersey
From Up-top to Out-West and down in the Dirty
Can't forget about the Mid-West, that's where I was found (what?)
That's where I live and Columbus is the town (yeah)
I got the pen, you got the paper, a CD, a tape, I
sign it then leave it to get a nice big plate of
fish, which is my favorite dish
But without y'all, I couldn't kick it like this
I wanna..

[Chorus: Jagged Edge &amp; Fundisha]
[F] I wanna thank you
[J] For makin me who I am and puttin me where I need to be
    I wanna thank you
[F] For the opportunity to do my thing in this industry
[J] I wanna thank you
    For callin to your local station everyday to play my song
    If it wasn't for you, there wouldn't be no me
    And that's why I'm gonna ride for you
[F] Forever more
[J] Fo' more
[F] Forever more, forever more
[J] I just wanna thank you

[Lil' Bow Wow]
I wanna thank you for the groups that came befo' me (uhh)
All of y'all in the office that promote me in the streets
All the mom and pop stores that don't get a lot of credit
(yeah) The spots in the hood, the first ones that said it
(said it) All the mix show's DJs, please keep it bumpin
Thank you for your support and yes I'm gonna keep it comin
(yeah) I love how you love that, so I'm givin back
cause y'all the ones that kept this playa on track
The reason I'm seen is because of you
The reason I'm heard and my dreams came true
Now if you ever made a poster, or wrote a fan letter
All I'm tryin do is show you is some L-O-V-E
And let you know without y'all there is no me
J.D., J.E., the whole S.S.D. (haha)
Now if you ride for we, then I'm gon' ride for you
From the bottom of my heart, baby tell 'em what I wanna do

[Chorus: Jagged Edge &amp; Fundisha]
[F] I wanna thank you
    For makin me who I am and puttin me where I need to be
    I wanna thank you
[J] For the opportunity to do my thing in this industry
[F] I wanna thank you
    For callin to your local station everyday to play my song
[J] If it wasn't for you, there wouldn't be no me
    And that's why I'm gonna ride for you, forever more
