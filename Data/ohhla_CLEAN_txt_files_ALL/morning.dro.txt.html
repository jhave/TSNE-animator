[Kool Keith]
Let me adjust my binoculars real quick
She's puttin peanut butter all in the dog's mouth
The dog is wearin lingerie
Wow... this is different

[repeat 2X: sung]
It's the morning.. girl we're rhymin
Sparklin diamond.. it's the morning!

[Kool Keith]
Girl I wanna touch you with the pervertedness
Lookin at you through the keyhold in the gym secretly peak at you
I've become a bug-a-boo, sweat you constantly
like a psycho on the phone, the Bell system won't know
Neither caller ID, five o'clock in the morning
Hello it's me, you won't get rid of me
Lookin through the window at night wit'cha tights on
Flashlight, you turn your lights on
No TV lamps, your kids at summer camp

[Chorus: sung]
It's the morning.. girl we're rhymin
Sparklin diamond.. it's the morning!
Girl we're rhymin, sparklin diamond.. 
It's the morrrning~!

[Kool Keith]
When I think of you, the time late or early
AT&amp;T operators know my boundaries
Touch tone king phone lines connect around the equator
Break the code of your answering machine
You in the panic room, I'm in the bottom basement
Face mask between Uncle Fester and the Mummy
Stocking cap, facial hair gone
You see the cameras; boo, Mr. Clean
The security disconnected all over the house
That's me downstairs camera show me walkin with a ice pop
Layin down on your beige leather couch

[Chorus]

[sung]
Girl we're rhymin, sparklin diamond.. 
It's the morrrning~!</pre>
