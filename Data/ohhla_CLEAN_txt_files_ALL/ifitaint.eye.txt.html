What's up?
How you feelin?
Yeah-yeah
3rd Eye
Guess who?
(3rd Eye
Come on
Come on)
Come on!

What you say, what you say?
You know the format, baby

I wanna hear some 3rd Eye
(Some 3rd Eye, kid)		(4x)

[ CHORUS: 3rd Eye &amp; Troo Kula ]
Now if it ain't rough, it ain't right
If it ain't rugged (then it ain't from the heart)
If it ain't rough, it ain't right
If it ain't wicked (then it ain't from the underground)	(2x)

[ VERSE 1: 3rd Eye ]
Why you frontin, you only wanna rock a party
Why you frontin, you ain't really rugged and rough
Why you frontin, you ain't down to shoot nobody
Why you frontin, I can see your blind man's bluff
So why you frontin, baby, I know you better
You kick your ruffneck slang, but I know better
That's dead to me, in '94 we got the remedy
Best remember we, I burn any when you're 70
And I'll be damned if my flavor's not the flim-flam
I been hardcore before you ever learned to -
Don't play me, you wanna fake the funk, but I see through that
Now you wanna come back hard, but you can't do that
Now who that, tryin to cross back, boy, you blew that
Now your shit is wack, ain't got no love from your crew, black
You shoulda knew: once you crossed over you was through
You made your mad dash for cash, now your ass is trash
I'm not goin for it, now you're rough again
Fake rappers switchin back and forth, I had enough of them
1994 it's time to pull your card, you ain't really hardcore
Yeah, so what you play hard for?

[ CHORUS ]
If it ain't rough, it ain't right
If it ain't rugged (then it ain't from the heart)
If it ain't rough, it ain't right
If it ain't wicked (then it ain't from the underground)
If it ain't rough, it ain't right
If it ain't rugged (then it ain't from the heart)
If it ain't rough, it ain't right
If it ain't wicked (then it ain't from the ghetto, black)

[ VERSE 2: 3rd Eye ]
(Why you frontin?) You only wanna rock a party
(Why you frontin?) You ain't really rugged and rough
(Why you frontin?) You ain't down to shoot nobody
(Why you frontin?) I can see your blind man's bluff
Guess who's back up on the block? What?
Rippin up the spot while you're frontin what you're not
Creep, I never sleep, cause I'm livin too deep
I reap what I sow and I sow what I reap
Yes, it's the Kula and the West, did you see that?
Time to manifest '94, and you say 'who dat?'
Step into the back cause they lack where we at
Schoolin the class is the fella to the track
Man, do you really understand, do you know the program?
You take your daily dips in the quicksand
Why'd you say that your skit is mad tight
With the hype type of flavor the ghetto kids like
With the murder and the guns and the cocaine runs
Wake up, wake up, cause you're dyin by the tons
You think you're tough, kid, but that's a bluff, kid
Never did a bid, kid, so what you want, kid?

[ CHORUS ]

(Why you frontin?) You only wanna rock a party
(Why you frontin?) You ain't really rugged and rough
(Why you frontin?) You ain't down to shoot nobody
(Why you frontin?) I can see your blind man's bluff

[ BREAK ]

[ VERSE 3: 3rd Eye ]
When it comes to Eye, for the '94, man
Melt down the hollow points and dismantle the guns
Dilute the mishaps, livin in the bad rap
Talkin 'bout they got gats when it ain't like that
Now who's that claimin that they fat and all that
Get prepared to go to war, black, you know the format
And we raw, baby paw, when we be buildin
I'm skilled when I represent the ghetto children
We just bring it on back, oh yes, indeed
You wanna lick shots on my crops and my seeds
Cease that, black, time to get back this time, aight
Cause if it ain't rough, it ain't right
And if it ain't right, it ain't wicked
And if it ain't wicked, you can kick it 
To the curb, that's my word
Offending comin from the 3rd Eye
Put your boots on, troop, we're goin huntin
MC's that be frontin

[ CHORUS till end ]</pre>
