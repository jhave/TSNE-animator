[G. Dep]
Yeah...
Yeah, me and my man's and them
We gon' blast off
Bad Boy nigga, and we don't stop
Come on to the top, blast off
Yeah, yo

Aiyyo, I take it up top for my peeps
Cracks in they Jeeps, don't sleep till they 6 feet deep
No 'lax' in my tracks they potent
Fuck homicide, I'ma ride, keep smokin'
I keep smokin' till the bullshit filter
Like cigarettes, Dep came through, killed ya
When I swerve hit nerves
Number 1 contenders, I put 'em on injured reserve
And everybody know what's golden, matter of fact platinum, 
?mores trap to mold in?
Once I explode and I, burn up the road and
Cruise around the globe, the cops thinkin' it's stolen
Understand, the world's in my hand
G. Dep in this scam, no stunt
Bitch play the front
And I'ma show you how to lay back do a buck while you puff on a sac
Cause yo, I'm about to blast off -

Straight to the chase, cause everybody know what's the case
Aiyyo, I'ma about to blast off
Straight to the point, aiyyo, yo, light another joint
Nigga, I'ma blast off
Right to the top, aiyyo, no, I ain't gon stop yo
Nigga, I'ma blast off
Straight to the dome, you entered in the Bad Boy zone

[Mark Curry]
Yo, yo, uh
Who's a nigga harder than me?
On the boats, make it known how the slaughterin' be
Damn, Curry ain't the shit? Put the name in your mouth
Got it different? You ain't on what you talkin' about
Bustin' off in her mouth, catch me
I'm feelin' for whoever test me, pity for whoever second guess me
Know how to ?manhand'? it's real as it get
Feelin' my shit, straight through the cealin' with this
Bet your block love it, find me only with the grimy
Gutters of the street where my mind be
Play the game, get you a 'zil'
Forever, put you until, it fit me to kill
Heat, got it with me still
Flip the game over, see me, we be, untouched
Out like your motherfuckin' guns bust, BLAOW
Sure shot, hit again, spit it grim, anytime, anyplace
Bitch, I'm about to-

[G. Dep]
Blast off, yo I get it poppin'
When I rock, yo it's non-stoppin'
Yo, I'm about to blast off
See me at the show, when I rock everybody know
Aiyyo, I'm about to blast off
Bottles gon' pop, cause when I rock, everybody rock
Aiyyo, I'm about to blast off
Straight to the top, cause everybody know this is hot

[Loon]
Aiyyo son, I'm about to blast off, like an astronaut
Niggas don't wanna see a nigga blast the glock
Niggas don't wanna see a nigga flash the rocks
And pop up in the flashy drop - motherfuckers
Niggas know me, Loon's a gunslinger
Fuck fightin' a nigga, I'm usin' one finger
Catch one of you rap cats in the 'Humdinger'
Some niggas get shot, live and become singers
Expect to die, I'd rather sit in a chair, electrified
Than to stand here and testify
But, other than that though, we never get caught
We George Jefferson walk out of federal court
We gettin' bread in New York, ain't better the sport
So whatever you thought, you can use whatever support
But, I think it's best you go 'head and just walk
Or have the cops find traces of lead in your corpse
Yo, I'm about to-

[G. Dep]
Blast off-
Straight to the chase, cause everybody know what's the case
Aiyyo, I'ma about to blast off
Straight to the point, aiyyo, yo, light another joint
Nigga, I'ma blast off
Right to the top, aiyyo, no, I ain't gon stop yo
Nigga, I'ma blast off
Straight to the dome, you entered in the Bad Boy zone</pre>
