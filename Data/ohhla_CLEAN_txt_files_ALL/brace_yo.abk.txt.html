Song:   Brace Yo Self
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You cant fuck with us
nope not gunna happen and you can spend your whole life rappin BITCH!
we on a higher level
a bigger plateua way above lookin down on them weak hoes
we got the game locked ain't nobody comin through
no ones around to hold us down even if they wanted to
so take a step back (move aside out the way)
the underground is comin through the family is here to stay
Its time to recenize really whats infront of you
paranormal music with a rhythm you can boogie to
given you hot flashes
makin your body shake felling the bass between your toes like you in an earthquake
so keep your head bangin we know you like it rough
I feel the same sometimes I cant get enough that's how we do undinably the hardest
and garented to life to go the farthest

[Chorus]
BRACE YO SELF and hold tight because tonight is gunna be a long ride
NO ONE ELSE can do this like us because they mind ain't right
All I KNOW is when it comes to the hatchet we attach it
AND THAT'S FHO SHO
cause its impossible to fuck with psychopathic
(WHOOP WHOOP)

Heads Cracken when we rappen
brains melt and leak out
bout to fucken freak out
and put a bullet in your mouth
down south up north from the east to the west
be some downest mother fuckers that'll put you to rest
for me
cut
bleed
and die so very slowly
leave your body holey
cut my initials so you know me
homie
ABK and AMB Representing family that's the way its gunna be droppen haters rapidly.

Yo Yo Brace your self Brake yourself
take the 9 millimeter and erase your self
try save yo self from the tribe called crazy
AMB and ABK we fade your face piece
chop a little out of the top of your shoulder
take the engine out of a lawn mower
make an explosive
put it under your front seat for fucken with ottis..
don't act like a never told ya
to brace yo self

[Chorus]

Brace yo self and hold on tight if I were you I would not let go
you cross that line into are are domain now we have to kill you slow..
ain't no exscapeing there's no way out now you belong to us
Now your exposed to the underground so you can see who not to trust!

Psychopathic automatic fresh shit on the mind
ain't nobody cut this we stay hardest from the grin Brace yo self
cause when we hit your dome its goen Splat!
better be ready for the attack
with an axe
hatchet
or gat

You can never stop are face in with the boots I wear
I'd be surprised if they fit and I'm a size 10 playa
industries your name is chump change
you ain't worth shit!
Your whole life is just a joke like a comedy bit

Right Right 7 inches worth the butcher knife
stuck inside your hooker wife just cause she was lookin right
everytime we do a show I take the show and take a life
Brace yo self and say goodnight underground scrub life BITCH

We axe murdering the industries and killing anybody hidden in the alley
creepin through their lobbies red and black we at war and we ready to fight
so you better brace yo self and hold on tight!

[Chorus]</pre>
