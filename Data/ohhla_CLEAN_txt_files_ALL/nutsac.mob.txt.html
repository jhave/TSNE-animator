Ice Cube:
It's like push, push, in the bush (man fuck you)
You from the cluck crew
Nigga I got money like a black man (man fuck you)

Jay-Dee
Negro you and your payroll

Ice Cube:
Say ho this nigga got the yay-O
Pump that shit from L.A. to San Diego
Now do you wanna join my crew?

Jay-Dee
Man fuck you nigga, I thought you knew
Now I gotta lay you out, play you out
For sellin' that shit all about

Ice Cube:
Nigga I got clout
Throughout the projects

Jay-Dee
Yeah, for robbin' black folks for their checks
Now we gotta break necks

Ice Cube:
Black man don't flex on a brother
Unless you a plain clothes, undercover

Jay-Dee
Man fuck you
You can't get your slang on
But you got black folks singin that same song (yeah)

Ice Cube:
I used to get my bang on
Now I got money anythang's on

Jay-Dee
Man fuck you
Because your dead wrong
Use your mind black man 
I can tell that your head strong

Ice Cube:
So what should I do?
Work for $3.22?
"Welcome to McDonald's may I please help you?"
I don't think so homey don't play that

Jay-Dee
Yeah, but heres a gun,
Can homey say gat? (yep)
So ease back
Or we'll peel your cap
'Cuz you can get a smack for that, black

Ice Cube:
So do you wanna join my crew?

Jay-Dee
Punk, I don't work for nobody (man fuck you)

Chorus:
(Ice Cube) I can tell, your         all on my nutsac
(Ice Cube) Motherfuckin peasants is     all on my nutsac

Jay-Dee
Niggas never thought dope-dealin would play out
So now they move way out
But nigga you can stay out - the ghetto
With your little baggies and shit

Ice Cube:
But I gotta buy my silk shirt and my khakis from the swap meet

Jay-Dee
Yeah fuckin' with them defs you got beat
And whitey can't wait to see yo' ass in the hot seat

Ice Cube:
Man, fuck you 'cuz I got rocks in my pockets
Get you so high niggas call my shit rockets
Money parlayin', got my car layin'
Bendin' on the corner sellin' 
Crack to the corners motherfucker

Jay-Dee
You'se a sucker
I hope a good ducker
Looks like I'ma have to bust a cap on my brother (yeah)

Ice Cube:
So do you wanna join my crew?

Jay-Dee
I told your little ass before (man fuck you)

Chorus:
(Ice Cube) It's a shame, your       all on my nutsac
(Ice Cube) And it's apparent, your      all on my nutsac

Jay-Dee
Driving through my hood
Rollin in your crack car
Basehead's out the block chasing like a track star

Ice Cube:
I might let a few of them catch me
Fuck the police the motherfuckers wanna stretch me
Have a big nigga undress me
Call me sweetheart or even sexy

Jay-Dee
Now who's giving up the crack
And I ain't talkin' about the plastic sacs
Man fuck that, you gonna let Jack play the mack
Guaranteed to hit your ass from the back

Ice Cube:
Man fuck you Jay-Dee
You got three babies
Talkin' that shit 
Punk, you can't phase me

Jay-Dee
But my nine goes "buck-buck...pow!"
Bitch! (now look at you now)

Ice Cube:
Man fuck you!

Jay-Dee
A tiskcut a tasket
Now look who's in a casket
I knew I'd get your ass one day
Scandulous bastard
