[JD &amp; Lil' Bow Wow]:
(Dance) Don't nobody move till I say so
(Hands) Up in the air if you feel me
(And) If you like to party, make dough, and ball it out
It's all right it's a stick up

[Lil' Bow Wow]:
It's tha bow to the wow, ballin' it out
Get dough, ride low, that's all we about
In da house, talking 'bout its tha young BG
With the 1-2-3 run, quick, see
How I give it to you in many different ways
Gotta get paid put it down for my age, now
Hey who keep the shorties reaching for me
I keep the party on the up and up
I chill in the cut where them fools throw it up
And the crew give me love
Dogg Pound pup for all you ladies
If you rolling with me then you know how it be, just

      (And) If you like to party, make dough, and ball it out
      It's all right it's a stick up

      (Hands) Up in the air if you feel me
      (And) If you like to party, make dough, and ball it out
      It's all right with me

[JD]:
Well I came in the door spitting nothing but game
Came in making niggaz switch up their chain
Knowing they ain't see no parts of this hot boy
Keep something pop boy, stay on the spot boy
Only in the big toys with the chrome wheels
Making all kind of noise, dressed to kill
Me and my lil' dog with the girls ready to hit
So So Def baby we the ultimate
Now is they ready yet?
[Lil' Bow Wow]:
Nah J I don't think so
[JD]:
Well whatcha wanna do?
[Lil' Bow Wow]:
Let all these fools know
My goal is to hold
Get the green with the eagle
I'm all about control and I ain't even legal

Repeat 1 (2x)

[Lil' Bow Wow]:
Now what'cha wanna do
Bang or bark, I'm a DPP with tha gangsta bark
Give it up to them ladies who bounce that thing
Hit em up with the playas who got phat game
[JD]:
Hey yo but what's your name
[Lil' Bow Wow]:
Bow to the wizzow
Yippe Yo Yippe Yeah I'm up in da house
I'm a car knocker, jeep rocker, six locker
Girls stop for us and everything's proper
Drop it like this and then like that
Like that, like this for the ladies and gents who
Bump in the coupe, ride or you lose
If you wild, we wild
Let me holla at you too

Repeat 1

[Lil' Bow Wow &amp; JD]:
Dance, hands, and
Dance, hands, and
Dance, hands, and</pre>
