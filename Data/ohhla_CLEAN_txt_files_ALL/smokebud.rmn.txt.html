Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Verse One]
Aiyyo, I got a slight problem I smoke weed too much
Knees buckle the -uck up when I'm splittin my dutch
Back up back up!  Ain't nobody hittin for free
It's just E Doubl-E, Keith Murray, and me
It cost twenty if you're down with it
Aiyyo son I ride around with my hooptie tinted
to ride around blitted
Cause I be feenin for that pookie
I smoke the good shhh, save the backyard boogie for all groupies
And I be, smokin up the hotel lobby
Between mo' sheets than the Isleys, I'm high G
I'm holdin it down for the B-Rrrah-I-C
K, blaze, tell you to get bluhh politely
(Hit the funky if you're riding around gettin blitz)
Ask me if I love the rap game -- I, I'm loving it
Cause I can do what the OWW/-uck I feel is real
Blaze the poot with D. Don and tell UHH to get the dillz

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I smoke on and on on, ya don't stop
I'm gettin mad -ucked up and ya don't stop
To all my real dogs, all my real pals
who ain't smokin, get the -uck owwwwt

[Verse Two]
I just love tokin, blackin out like Tame in the open
Of course I got the raw dog no need to stick your nose in
Gave you a straight up shotgun when we was smokin
Froze you so fast -- you looked it like Madonna Vogue-in
AwwwwuhhhhH!  I got the shhh to get your whole click high
We can get high, but act funny and I'ma whip out
And they gon' whip out, and blow notes like Michel'le
Cause you tried to jump the cipher and it goes THISSAWAY

[Chorus]

[singing] Smoke buddha, smoke buddha...
