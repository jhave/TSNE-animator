Song:   Contradiction
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

The other day, me and XP opened for Souls Mischief
I'm like "Yo, let's get on some angry MC showmanship and hit 'em"
Rocked all the cocky songs and not too many soulful lyrics
Even a couple dissin' women callin' 'em groupies, hoes, and bitches
Got off stage, and I'm like "Yo, I know that we killed it"
Ran into a familiar face, a female who comes in and supports us
I said "Peace!" She said "Wait! Let me talk to you for a minute
I know it's none of my business, but I wasn't impressed by your performance"
I said "Word? Shit, I love feedback and criticism"
She said "I miss the passionate spirit, your political vision
Quite honestly I wasn't offended by those references to women
But you're only continuing society's conditioning"
It hit the heart of me
I told her that this was part of me
I stand up for human rights, and treat others how I would wanna be treated
But every song can't be seepin' with freedom
'Cause the other side of me is sexist then people will feel that I'm preachin'
"Everything's peace and love?" uhh, that's somewhat misleading
Because this world is fucked-up and I'm a pro-duct to what I'm seeing
Not to justify, but just to touch on my being
I learn from these verses and my purpose gets surfaced with demons
Now I am sexist, I'm prejudice, I put that in my music
She said she heard that perspective, but before she turned around
She said "We have a flame, your fire's ignited with sound
Are you building the empire up, or using your fire to burn it down?"

[Chorus: x2]
Consumption, contradiction. I'm conflicted with being a hypocrite
And through these songs you can witness it
The differences, I admit this shit, because I'm just like you
Walking a fine line between saying and living it

[Overvoice:]
Light it up to burn it down, light it up to burn it down
Light it up to burn it down, down, down
Light it up to burn it down, light it up to burn it down
Light it up to burn it... down, down, down, down, down, down, down

Now one thing that I've always struggled on
Is how to incorporate drugs and alcohol into my music
Outside of sober songs
'Cause on that perspective, that's all over my records
But the other side isn't represented unless it sessions with XP
How can I admit that I love to smoke weed
Knowing the kids are listening and many of 'em look up to me?
Not to say that I'm a role model
But I know that words are power
And if I condone bottles and chronic, I am sending out the
Message "It's okay," hey I believe that it is. Chronic can be medicine
But it's all about your relationship with it
See I'm either off in the wagon riding and everyday with the spliff
Constantly looking for a balance but habit turns to addiction
And hip-hop music &amp; weed: they're inseparable
So MCs that don't smoke or drink, talking about it to me seems questionable
It proves how much people just want to be accepted
And not seem straight-edge to their audience, so keeping it real is neglected
'Cause when I'm smoking, I wouldn't wanna bump a song like this
Put on some Devin, break out the Swishers and a bong and some licks
See that's a part of me too
And I know that I would make more money if I wasn't as true
To all the stuggles of the blunted consumption I'm going through
Make music for the party, and the people support you
I burn Brother Ali and buy 50, what does that say to you?
Bring it back around
Am I building the empire up or using my fire to burn it down?

[Chorus x2]</pre>
