How we gon' get in for free?

Now, I calculate the beatin for approximated speakin
Play it at your party for intoxicated freakin
One for the motherfuckers at the par-ty
Two for the DJ's bumpin this for me
Three for the girls with the fake ID
and a pound if you snuck through the back for free
See sneakin into shit probably always been my hobby
1985, in the Henry J. lobby
Ten bones for the Fresh Fest to me was like robbery
Tennis shoes squeakin -- security tried to mob me
People screamin so loud, they lungs got broke when
$hort grabbed the mic and started yellin out, "OAKLAND!"
Not the type of brother that's hard with a death wish
but one thing that I'll die for is bein on the guest list
I'm talkin bout a pissyfit, sayin loud explicit shit
"Can't you read my name motherfucker; ain't you literate?!?!!"
I be sayin this even if it ain't legitimate
Although it ain't considerate, I get in with no scrilla spent
Caught the 57 bus to the Coliseum
Run-D.M.C. and LL, gotta see em
Negotiatin with a guard out by the trailer
Me and twenty potnahs got in for a Taylor
Later in the game shit was much more elaborate
Motherfuckers rocked the spot, with fake laminate
Show em to security, and it was like BAM!
On stage with Ice Cube at the Summer Jam
I'm not a fronter and, this ain't a cover band
I'm always givin you the really and no other than
Alameda Drive-In, didn't wanna pay a buck
Five motherfuckers layin flat, in the mini-truck
Used to sneak in to the Eastmont Cinemas
Through the exit, sometimes about ten of us
But you know, I guess it was so easy
cause they playin movies that's already on TV
Most of them flicks I can't recommend
But back then, half the fun was sneakin in
See me in the alley, but nah I ain't no crack hoe
I'm waitin for my folks to open up the back do'</pre>
