Man if you know me, you know we homies
Itch, you're tied, demanding one and only
It's like the candy rain, all in the house of pain
And the one that hustle will survive, mane
When it comes to wrecking records, I'm like a bomb stealth
Freeze a ball, then torture him, then I watch him melt
I love being boss, I hate to take a loss
Keep my mind the same way as Microsoft
It's a conspiracy, and that'll never die
I opened up the sky, man to tell God hi
He said "What's up King Nicky?", I said "Man I'm parlayin"
He say I'm living reckless, I say "Lord, what you sayin?"
He said "I'm gonna have to take you to a better place
if you don't slow down boy, yo and cut your pace"
I got like hella quiet, I fired up the weed
Must a Tiga slow down his fast speed?
I hit the gas pedal, said I'm a rap rebel
And man he left me, had me hand-delivered to the devil</pre>
