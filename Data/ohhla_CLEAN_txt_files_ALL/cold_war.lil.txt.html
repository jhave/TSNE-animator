[Sample]
"This is a Cold War; do you know what you're fighting for?"

They tryna take my life
I guess I'm a human sacrifice
Lil B... what you gon' do?
Cause they coming for you, feel me?

What you gon' do?
Cause they coming for you, you feel me?

[Verse 1]
Most of the world live in blindness
Time after time, gotta replant, snakes is behind us
Plus they pocket-watching and they feeling like flodging
Make you wanna strap up and murder everybody blocking
What's really going on? You know, what's really going on?
Everybody want the throne and then you gonna die alone..
And the game is getting shady, outlandish
There's voices in my head and I can't really understand em
What they saying.. speak to me.. it's Lil B

[Verse 2]
They tryna kill me... haters want me dead...
Nigga, we dying over muthafuckin jewelry
Masculine niggas acting hard for reactions
All for the bitches, all for the fashion
Niggas 35 acting 25 while I sit back in my room and I think...

The world's all perfect: let me fantasize
What we fighting for? We dying to live
Going up, now we living to die
Put my hands in the sky, looking up man, asking for guidance
It's not the world's fault, it's the people inside it
This shit turned me shady
You seen the reaper inside him
Now they feel it in the air, see the evil inside him
Separate from the fake cause you sleeping beside them
Underground 6 feet nigga.

Uh, it's Lil B
What you gon' do?
Cause they coming for you, you feel me?</pre>
