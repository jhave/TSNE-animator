Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uhu, baby, I said baby
Let's talk tonight, baby,
I said, baby, well oh well, oh well
You bet me ready then top off like a fighter
When I get my snake you bite tip with your tiger
You are the crop and the cream, have me hooked like a fiend
And that's you girl so sweet
Everything about you is cool, and now I know is no fool
And her body's right, yeah
You make me think of some more
Like MJ said, that girl is mine
I take her back to the room, she want me tonight
That's when I said

Let's take it slow, slow, baby
Cause your loving is worth the wait
No more words cause my breath will take
Let's take it slow, slow, slow baby, yeah
Cause your loving is worth the wait, yeah
No more words cause my breath will take

See I don't wanna risk nothing baby
With you I will patiently wait
For the best part, you if it takes
Longer, than we know longer, I don't care the seasons come and go
Baby I will be here, with you through the years
So just let it flow, nice and slow
You will know, that I am for real, baby I am for real

Let's take it slow, slow, baby
Cause your loving is worth the wait
No more words cause my breath will take
Let's take it slow, slow, slow baby, yeah
Cause your loving is worth the wait, yeah
No more words cause my breath will take

Let's talk tonight, just me and you
Well oh well, listen, ya
You bet ready then top off like a fighter
When I get my snake you bite tip with your tiger
You are the crop and the cream, have me hooked like a fiend
And that's you girl so sweet
Everything about you is cool, and now I know is no fool
And her body's right, yeah
That's when I say

Let's take it slow
Slow, baby
Cause your loving is worth the wait
No more words cause my breath will take
Let's take it slow, slow, slow baby, yeah
Cause your loving is worth the wait, yeah
No more words cause my breath will take</pre>
