[Intro - Chamillionaire as Dexter - talking] (Charlie)
Hello?
(Hello?)
What's up, Charlie?
(What's up, man?)
Nothin, just watching "American Idol", just searching on the 'net
(Heard anything about Chamillionaire?)

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire as Dexter] (Dexter's Mom) [Charlie]
Heard he lost twenty million dollars, how'd he lose that?
Heard he got dropped from Universal, how he lose that?
Heard his new single and that +Creepin' (Solo)'s+ super whack
Anyways, Ludacris just wrecked him on his own track
Ha, he's the rapper that my brother hates
He commit suicide, so I'm a take my brother's place
Let me log on the 'net, I don't have no time to waste
I'm a log on Chamillionaire.com and rub it in his face
Chamillionaire sucks, Chamillionare's a square
He's drops a lot of mixtapes but I don't care
If he don't switch it up, then I know he's gonna fail
And if he does switch it up, then I just hope it don't sell
Hell, he's super boring, he has no swagger
He's part of a league of rappers that just don't matter
I don't know why DJ Skee or Drama even mess with him
Oh no, there he go, sayin he's the best again
Plus he had the nerve to call my bro an +Internet Nerd+
I'm a log on his Gmail and hack his f-ing password
Sure, he's got Internet fans
But I never heard nobody in the streets jammin him
Mixtape Messiah, HAHA!, better think again
His last one sucked, I never made it up to number ten
I couldn't even pretend, that I would ever get him
I'll never go to his show and not gonna get his album "Venom"
He sucks, what the heck are people even listening to?
His rhyme patterns are enough to, make me miserable
Make me want to enter in-to a mental institute
In the real commercial world, he is like invisible
On the 'net, they're sayin he got witty bars
I'm a say he's whack, post it under every Diddy blog
And plus I wonder overseas, is he really large?
He's probably on vacation, I don't think he really toured
My sister tried to tell me that he got fifty cars
Hi Chamillionaire, none of those are really yours
He's really leasin 'em but I'm the one that really knows
I'm a put ya on World Star and you're gonna be exposed
His personality stinks, can't stand the scent of it
Where's his website?  He didn't even finish it
If he thinks he'll sell as much as Wayne, then he's an idiot
I don't think he even made a song good as +A Milli+ yet
Chat rooms or something that I'm normally glued to
But I don't wanna conversate with none of you fools
'Cause you think he's good, ant wrong, you lose
Yesterday he wasn't even top 10 on YouTube
Yeah trick, just admit it, y'all frontin
Charles Hamilton, Joell Ortiz, even Joe Buddens
All of them are better than him (Dexter), y'all don't know nothin
(Dexter, come down here now), ha, my mom's callin me - I'm coming
[Why you mad at me man?]
