Hoo ha
Hoo ha
Hoo ha

I can be evil I can be good but I don't know if I really should
Be evil to those jealous MCs
That want to try and immitate me
Take you step into my land
Come immitate me like a foolish man
Enter your dreams like Freddy Kruger
Rip out ya brains the dark intruder
Hellraiser another dimension
Terrorise ya soul
Now that's my intention
Vampire Count Dracula
Bite your neck
Hoo ha ha
Hunt you down
I come tear out your heart
Werewolf I'm coming in dark
Zombified now mummification
You'll be if you mess with my patience

I can be evil I can be good but I don't know if I really should
Be evil to those jealous MCs
That want to try and immitate me
Take you step into my land
Come immitate me like a foolish man
Enter your dreams like Freddy Kruger
Rip out ya brains the dark intruder
Hellraiser another dimension
Terrorise ya soul
Now that's my intention
Vampire Count Dracula
Bite your neck
Hoo ha ha
Hunt you down
I come tear out your heart
Werewolf I'm coming in dark
Zombified now mummification-tion-tion

I'm dat bada-bad man
Mic MC digi-doin it right now yer bubblee
When I hold the microphone in my hand

Come with the bad bam
Mic MC digi-doin it right now yer bubblee
When I hold the microphone in my hand
