Typed by: IcyBlayze@hotmail.com

I dedicate this song to all the kids out there
Growing up without they father in they life
That's some real serious shit
Y'all listen
I know I'm not perfect but I strive to be
Feel it

I met you at only five months, spittin image of a one night stand
Between woman and man
Beautiful baby girl, not a worry in the world
I see the sun rise in your innocent eyes and I'm hypnotized
Lemme tell you bout life and bout the way it is
Oh this world ain't nothing like folks say it is
Lemme protect you from these years to come
Bout a fairy tale life far away from the slums
You'll be mines if I could rewind time
You know me so long though, you got them killer eyes of mine
When you get older you understand
Especially when your peers tell you Mac was one hell of a man
I never met your real dad
And I never meant for this to make a nigga feel bad
And that's my word, you couldn't understand the essence and this I know
Cause I was there to watch you grow
Is you feeling me

Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
This is what it sound like
Growing up without your godfather in your life

Young black male growing up without a father figure
Ha ha ha, makes it that much harder nigga
Trying to be a man with no example of a man
Mama doing what she can but she can't show you how to be a man
And this is where we break down
We used to be cops and robbers, turn into shake down
Now we living like rebels, born killers
We born to be kings and queens nigga, on the reala
I know that you and your baby mama can't get along
But there's no excuse, so leave the kid alone
Cause ain't nothing like the birth of a child
A blessing in disguise, the girls, the guys with they daddy's eyes
And think about this before you abandon them
The people they try and can't even having one
Before you say I'm preaching and you don't wan' hear it
Take a look in the mirror, can you feel it

Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
This is what it sound like
Growing up without your godfather in your life
Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
Daddy do you love me and if so
Why you wasn't there to hug me and watch me grow
This is what it sound like
Growing up without your godfather in your life</pre>
