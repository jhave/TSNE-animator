[Intro: Betty Wright]
Who is this callin me this time of morning?! 
Ohh.. Lenny! Oh! 
When you're with 'em they don't know what to do
When you leave 'em, then they act like they can't live without ya
This is the last time I'm answerin this phone..

[Chorus: Lenny Williams] 
Baby come back (Baby come back!)
You know that I miss you baby (You know that I miss you)
Won't you come back this way again? (Won't you come back this way again?)
I miss you old friend (I miss you old friend)

[Verse One: Betty Wright]
I just can't believe that there is 
no more left of all of those years  
We were the rock of ages, life stared turning pages 
Now I can write a thesis on how we fell to pieces 
I pray the pain decreases, ceases  

[Chorus: Lenny Williams] (Betty Wright)
Baby come back (Not this time)
You know that I miss you baby (Not this time baby)
Won't you come back this way again? (Not this time baby)
I miss you old friend (No..)
Baby come back (I don't think so)
You know that I miss you baby 
Won't you come back this way again? (Oooohhh...)
I miss you old friend (Ohh..)

[Verse Two: Bettyy Wrighht]
See I had an open vision of how we would be living  
So free from all dissention, like in our own dimension 
We were the model couple, it was like seein double 
And then came all the trouble, struggle 

[Chorus]
Baby come back (Oh...)
You know that I miss you baby (I really miss you)
Won't you come back this way again? (Back this way again)
I miss you old friend (My baby..)
Baby come back 
You know that I miss you baby (Ohhh)
Won't you come back this way again? (Oh no)
I miss you old friend 

[Bridge]
People won't let you be 
They can't stand to see you happy 
They don't want to see nobody happy  
Not really, no, not really 
They say we're too close to breathe 
Is that why you chose to leave? 
And the jealousy, it was gettin to me 
That's why I chose to leave 

[Chorus]
Baby come back (I don't think so)
You know that I miss you baby (And I don't think so)
Won't you come back this way again? (I don't think so)
I miss you old friend (I don't think, I don't think so)
Baby come back (I don't wanna hear it)
You know that I miss you baby (I can't hear it)
Won't you come back this way again? 
I miss you old friend 
Baby come back (That's just talk baby)
You know that I miss you baby (That's why I had to walk baby)
Won't you come back this way again? (He said and she said)
I miss you old friend (Thhey said, and youu said)
Baby come back 
You know that I miss you baby (I cain't tell)
Won't you come back this way again? 
I miss you old friend 

[Outro: Betty Wright] (Lenny Williams)
All I know is, I don't see no change (Hey!)
(C'mon) And I'm so tired of the PAIN (I miss you, darling)
Girls, do you believe he asked me (Oh..)
was it the talk that made me walk? (Ohhh oh-oh-oh-oh, baby)
Oh no, I was influenced, by what he was doin
(C'mon) It wasn't just no talk
(Sho' nuff miss you, baby) I got eyes and I see
I'm so TIRED, I'm so tired of it
I saw what he was doin to me
Oh yeah, you keep sangin-a, you keep sangin it
You keep playin and uh, ohh Lenny
(Ohhhhh oh-oh-oh-oh baby)
I've had dreams, I've had dreams...</pre>
