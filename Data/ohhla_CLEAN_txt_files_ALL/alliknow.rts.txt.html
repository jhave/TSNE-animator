Song:   All I Know
Typed by: NaztyMuney@aol.com, OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

And now, Ladies and Gentlemen in your right corner
Weighing in at an even 215 pounds
Residing from the South Bronx
Maintaning 39 wins, 40 knockouts, and no losses,
It's the undisputed beatbox champion of the world!!

Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X

All I know
That's a bad motherfucker
All I know
He's about to drop some shit now
All I know

[Rahzel]
When I first came out, many couldn't catch my name
Now worldwide, feel the affects, scratch my name
Rahzel, now rewind that, (Gargling) slow it down, you'll find that
the way I design that, and reverb behind that, not in my contract
I'm bustin all over this bitch, while your girl cums
Down with the Two-One-Fifth, Illadelph, Dy-Nast'
R-double-O-T-S, no need to remind us
You're far behind us, tryin to high beam, blind us
Catching shinas from a nickle plated niner (Gun sounds)
Blastin' holes in your designers
This is for you primadonnas
cause my persona's like pirhannas
I got you second guessin and sweatin like saunas
If you learned from the second lesson, no question you want it
Change your facial expressions from minutes to seconds to longer
God damn it feel good to see people up on it

Chorus

[Rahzel]
Who's the man, Rahzel's the +Man+, so yo, pass the +Method+
1200 styles, crush your crew without no effort
Let me flip my, vocabulary, vocal acrobatics
Smack up phone dramatics, I can jam like automatics
Nine millimeter, twelve rounds, one in the chamber
Russian Roulette, you can bet, there is DAN-JUR
Number five in the Billboard, with the bullet
One million, in my pile, you know the style, let me pull it
cause I'm about to blast ya, take the mic, then harrass ya
Switch up speeds, without the weed, then I'll pass ya
Nineteen-ninety-nine, octane, because I gassed ya
Watch me George Jet, on-you-son, like I'm NASA
God damn, like to ?? compare on blaster ??
(shadowboxing sounds) It's the sound affect master
"And I'll destroy anyone, who dares go against me"

Chorus

[Rahzel]
I got your mouth wide open, just like the Grand Canyon
I'm Trugoy, to this rap game, I got game
Call me Denzel, with the rap name, I got aim
"He's on FIRE!!" like a coal in a hot flame
plus my Posdonuses, produces, your prognosis
Kids doin the chronic from coast to coast kid
Death, what the doctor ordered, so say, "Ahhh"
Take you +Three Feet High and Risin+, like De La
C'est la vie, I'm yo' super MC
Got the S on my chest for you to buy my LP
Check the outlets for cassettes and CD
Sam Goody, Blockbustin' up your H M V
Nigga please, ask yo mamma for some cheese
Tell her need some restitution like them Vietnamese
in Vietnam, cause Rahzel drops the bomb
More complex than texts, in your Holy Qu'ran
