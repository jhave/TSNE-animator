[Intro: Joel Madden]
Ohh! (Ohh!) To the sects (to the sects!)
Ohh! (Ohh!) This the one right here!
Ohh! I'm the onnnnne

[Bizzy Bone] + (Joel Madden)
Through the fire wire, through the rain
Through the rain, through the rain
Through the fire wire, through the rain
Through the pain, through the pain (Ohh! I'm the onnnnne)
And only one can be the one, it better be
Get out of my way, say (Ohh!)

[Bizzy Bone]
Through the fire wire, through the rain and pain and pyre
The temperature hotter then lava, the medium, medium meetin 'em tedium
B.B. The Kid sire, Allah the king administer candles, kiss the ring
Dig in the brain and find the Ying, part of the negative there go the Yang
Thinkin they're deep and they're ready to get with the glory thang
Steady the people that think that we whisperin
baby we born in the sin and we bang
Steady the thugs and look at the buzz
I look at the drugs, I look at the buds
Out of their minds, you know what it is
if you're gettin mad you don't know what it was
Memory blood the duster, the dust in the wind, I don't need to cuss
If I was a woman I'd come as a woman
and give you an angel you never could touch
The spirit the light, the birds the flight, the bread and even the rush
I don't need nothin, whatever you're doin is makin my brain feelin the touch
Eliminate hate, open the palms and carry your babies, I sing this song
Walk in the garden open arms, disgusted, gotta stay calm
Look at the angst of angels, they walkin the earth, they miss their spouses
Humans homes and houses, mini-mansions and mountains, all will be found and

[Chorus: Bizzy] + (Joel Madden)
(Ohh! I'm the onnnnne) And only one can be the one, it better be
Get out of my way, say-ay-ay-ay-ay
(I'm the onnnnne) Yeahhh, and only one
It's only one, it's only one one one one
(I'm the onnnnne) And only one can be the one, it better be
Get out of my way, say-ay-ay-ay-ay
(I'm the onnnnne) Yeahhh, and only one
It's only one, and only one (Ohh!)

[Bizzy Bone]
Crush yo' ass..
I know what they're lookin for, huh, they never will find it though
Overflowin the cup, and then what? Shall I go further yo?
Shalt never murder though, shalt never covet another man's propert-o
Shalt never steal, never use thy Lord's name in vain and though
Many more to go, never act like you the Lord and you'll see
No adultery, gotta be all you can possibly be
And don't make out to be a lion, funny you think I'm lyin, it's me
And walkin the streets and ridin an ambulance straight to the bed and an IV
An eye for an eye, I never go by, you gotta forgive 'em and let it be
Think of the sign, the temple the mind, we get on the grind and decree
By any degree, feelin the burn, the family sayin they love me
Is that what I see? Is that what is after everything nothin but your greed?
Remember the vibe, remember the tribe, you never could murder me twice
Remember the pride, I got rid of mine in '89, still got a life
After all you handle your promises, it's so many lies, a smokin gun
I forgive you, but I know who is the one - Allah

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
How many men you know that can birth up a baby
and burpin my baby and don't have a lady
Come back from the walk and she actin so shady
and smokin with homie, it still doesn't phase me
And leave, it's nothin to eat, the baby is cryin
I walk him to sleep and he wake up as Bryon
No money, I crawl out the gutter
and tell me to whoop on the child
You better believe, when the beatin is what you receive
Wake up and you'll wind up in the beginnin
with no precious metals and demons are pleased
Now you in the breeze, why you fuckin with me?
You're visibly stripped to your knees
And givin yourself more credit then you deserve
I worship the Lord, you worship a dream
The triple the beam, the trinity, and eyein the fiend
The theory of rocks, you know what I mean? (The Big Bang)
You know what I mean? (what?)
Duster, with the dust of wind I don't need to cuss
If I was a woman I'd come as a woman
and bring you an angel you never could touch (woo!)
The spirit the light, the birds the flight
the bread and even the rush
I don't need nothin, whatever you're doin
you're makin my brain feelin the touch
Eliminate hate, open the palms, carry your babies, I sing the song
Walk in the garden with open arms, disgusted but I stay calm

[Chorus]  first 6 lines

[Joel Madden] + (Bizzy Bone)
I'm the onnnnne (yeahhhh, yeahhh)
Ohh, ohh! (Yeah, yeah)
One one one... one one one one...</pre>
