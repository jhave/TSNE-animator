[Chorus 2X: Badu and Bilai: sung in tune to "Hydralic Pump" by P-Funk All Stars]
I know you, waaaaaaant tooooo
Jump up in the air and stay there
Jump up in the air and stay there
Jump up in the air and stay there
Jump up in the air and stay there
Jump up in the air and stay there
Jump up in the air and stay there

[Erykah Badu]
Jumped, up, out my seat
I know you want, tooooo
Something musta got in me
I know you want, tooooo
Church never felt this good befo'
I know you want, tooooo
'Cept I was at the club - uh oh
I know you want, tooooo (Bounce - hey)
C'mon

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you want to, reach to the higher level
Much further from the devil, until you feel the weather
I know you want to, reach to the higher level
Much further from the devil, until you feel the weather

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Hi  G-H-two-oh, dial never
My level far from the devil, have some manners 
Say hello, to angels and watch out for Uranus
I go nuts like a Danish then vay-nish into thin air 
and stay in there
This is D. Carter, betta bring ya swimwear
Heh, but I'm shallow and when ya this high
Everybody else balow - oops, I meant below!
Mijo, zero degree yo, frio
Get into your +soul+ like Neo, whee-oh
Oh, I meant oh-whee - or is it ooh-whee?
Truly, I don't give a fuck 
I am on the ceiling stuck, like a fan full of dust
Like her hand full of bucks I'm, spendin like crazy
I'm in Wayne's World where the women like ladies
And you don't need a telescope to see Weezy F. Baby, hah!

[Erykah Badu]
We don't give a fuck (hey)
We on the ceiling stuck (heeeey)
Like a fan full of dust, like her hand full of bucks
We spendin like, cra-zay
We don't give a fuck (hey)
We on the ceiling stuck 
Like a fan full of dust, like her hand full of bucks
We spendin like, cra-zay
On the ceiling stuck (hey)
We don't give a fuck (heeee)
Like a fan full of dust, like her hand full of bucks
We spendin like, cra-zay
We don't give a fuck (hey)
We on the ceiling stuck 
Like a fan full of dust, like her hand full of bucks
We spendin like, cra-zay
