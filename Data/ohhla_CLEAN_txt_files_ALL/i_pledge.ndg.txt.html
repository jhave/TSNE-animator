[Chorus]
I, pledge alle-giance
to all my hom-ies who may ne-ver
lo-ove a ho and ne-ver will..
I, give my bo-dyyy
and I give my so-ulll to the funk
May the funk, never end

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
I pledge allegiance, to paper chasers
To hustlers who be steady pullin capers
Peace and blessing, may the sun always shine on you
I'm servin paper, see ya later
I guess that's one mo' thing, I can't be faited
You can test me, get discombobulated
Ain't no question I'm gon' fuck with this
I do it for the funk of it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
I pledge allegiance to my - homies who keep it gangsta
Fuck all the haters they can't stop this groove
I pledge allegiance to the - game cause it got me ballin
Game don't wait so I'm not stallin
I'm still dissin, she's still callin

[Verse 3: Pharoahe Monch] 
Uhh, what, what, yeah
Uhh, check it out now, uh
See this is front line, no turnin back now
I'm about to score, this is war on the track now (woo!)
Give me my vest and my ammo and my mac now
I'm 'bout to spit it, and Lord I'ma get it
in the worst WAYYY, slay - competition
Move the opposition, back wake the fuck up! (uh-huh)
Cause when I get beyond enemy lines
I might snipe that ass like John Kennedy's mind
Thou shall not get caught, that's the remedy
Disinfect gun wounds on my last bottle of Hennessy
Bleed to let the seeds remember my memories
It's killed or be killed here son that's the penalty
RIDE for the funk, CRY for the funk
In the heat of night, I DIE for the funk
Pharoahe, when I'm six feet deep there's no greivin
Salute the noblest troop and pledge allegiance cause

* 1st half alone, 2nd half mixes with Nate Dogg's [Verse 2]
