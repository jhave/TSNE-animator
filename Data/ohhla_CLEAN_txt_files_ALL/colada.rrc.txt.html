[Chorus 2x]
Where're my niggaz with the big dicks? -Ahh
Where're my niggaz with the hot whips? -Ahh
Where're my niggaz living better? 
We want Barettas and Amarettas, butter leathers and mad cheddar

[Sheik]
(Ayo Pun, I got you baby)
We play the front not the back, when there's beef I attack
Grab the guns and start lighting 
Ya'll the bitch niggaz behind cars scared to death like "yo, who fighting?" 
How the fuck you teaching me I ain't got no obedience  
Ya'll are made of shit I'm the thug's ingredients
And for my niggaz I peel like fucked up paint jobs 
Cover your block and put holes in you like old blankets 
Fuck a bitch use a sock and wipe my nut what? 
Run in your spot and use a Glock to get my cut what? 
Smack you in public and embarrass you slut what? 
Put you on punishment the same way I do to my son 
And the only bullets by my stomach be the clip from my gun 
And when my gun busts it's over so close the curtains 
My silencer's like ch, ch, ch like birds was chirping 
I like Boricuas ya know that Sheik be freaky 
I put coke in their peepee then stuff the bras 
Put some coke in the bras that look like coconuts 
That's what's up don't have Sheik's click clack this up 
Disload the back pack her bitch ass back me up 
You know double R and Terror Squad niggaz want they cut.

[Chorus 2x]

[Big Pun]
I'm well know like Al Capone, full blown like Tone Montana 
In the zone sitting on chrome stoned sipping on Champana 
Rolling ganja up in Bible paper 
A high that will take us through the eyes of Christ, John, Elijah, Jacob 
I make the kind of green that hustler's dream 
Busting out that custard cream 
Piper cause I'm piped up with the mustard team 
Plus the queen Fort Knox and hearts 
King of medallions Monty Guard 
Even Italians see my battalion prop the broad 
I got the squad over qualified pulling over Karl Kani 
Range Rover tilted three wilted hydraulic slide 
Spark the Live in the crowd ripping trough housings 
Like the Wu do in Shaolin 
John Blazing on a pound of buddha and all the mami chulas, 
They want to ride on my Honda scooter 
You know the red one from the video 
But really though she ain't coming and she ain't running the 
Trizzie yo!

[Chorus 2x]

[Big Pun]
Disrespect the Don word's bond I'm gonna shoot ya 
We can get it on maricon hijo'de gran puta 
Who you fucking' wit? 
Bitch ass nigga you ain't running' up on shit 
Talking' like you gonna bust yo clip 
nigga you ain't no fucking threat
You talk a lot but you ain't never realized that if you walk that block
Cock that Glock, think I'm pussy oh shit man! 
Big Punisher's off his rocker
What you got? Beef wit' me? Aight then papi, Sheik's with me
Thought you cats were gonna creep on me 
without some type of an injury.

[Chorus 2x]

[Sheik]
I see coward in yours, what you up in my eyes?  
Big dick between mine, What the fuck between your thighs?
Pussy, If I shoot, are you gonna shoot back?
I don't think so, your man's the thug you ride piggy-back
You're the one that passed the gat, told your man to bust that
You ain't making no money, you're a broke-ass cat
And once these pop, cops bring the chalk 
and the mop to get the rest of you off the sidewalk. what!

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
