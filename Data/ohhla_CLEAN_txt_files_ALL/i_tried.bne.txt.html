Bone Thugs...Akon, yeah

[Intro: Wish Bone]
You know don't nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard
I've tried hard, but I guess I gotta try harder

[Chorus: Akon]
I've Tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man i've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cuz I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you will come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
First let me explain that I'm just a black man (a black man)
And I come from the dark side so I'm having a hard time stayin' on track man
My mind be racin and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
I'm starting to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back
Prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really im wrong and again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane
Chasing me dreams
And then it seems like when the fame and cash came
It just got me goin' craaaazzzy lately
I've been so faded
Tryin' to erase it
But I just cant cuz the drama just grows greater
And I've been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off till later

[Chorus: Akon]
I've Tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man i've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cuz I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you will come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
It's like I'm taking 5 steps forward and 10 steps back
Tryin to get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And i keep runnin away from the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close
And uhh, I just don't know but I be out here fighting demons
And it's like a curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland
And Lord would you help me (help me)
And stop this pain I keep inficting on my family (my family)
Hustlin' and gamblin'
Trickin' and scramblin'
And losing sight of what I'm sposed to be handlin
It's hard to manage
Cuz everydays a challenge
And man I'm slippin'
Can't lose my balance I'm tryin' not to panic

[Chorus: Akon]
I've Tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man i've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cuz I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you will come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
I see that things won't change
I'm stuck in the game
As soon as I get out it keeps pullin' me back (pullin' me back)
Got me doin' dirty dirty
So used to this hustlin' money that I don't understand no nine to five work
Studied on the streets, hustlas know what I mean
Hustlas ballin' before us I'm tryin' to make it to that major league
So we will never leave
Until the sun came up
Gotta get it no nope not leaving no what
Today games they play
Gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you (on you)
Gotta watch what you sign to
Try so hard but I wont pull through

[Chorus: Akon]
I've Tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man i've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cuz I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you will come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough</pre>
