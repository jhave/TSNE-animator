Song:   We are the Horsemen
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

	As we search for black people and white people
	seeking the world of the four horsemen facing
	John, Henry, the robot, Dr. Smith, and Will Robinson
	Come in please -- on track for the remix

[Kool Keith]
Adjusting our systems the horsemen are ready to go
Our jets, should be ready for take off, any second

	Aheheheheheheheh!

I probe for evidence, movin, positive beams
Incite the first gadget, my atom explodes
Just hit the fifth planet, the X reload
Take a brother on a flight for the Alpha, Omega
I kick lyrics on Earth, you think I'm cosmic
A spacewalker, dippin in my spacecraft
Through molecules, a steel wall interphase
The Fourth Horseman, legendary universe
Dark shadow human rhymin on a funky verse
I'm level 7, Optimus pull back
Feeding the world of gamma data, to locate
You interlock, power 7 warp speed
Negative charge, biochemically crush
My own nucleus bomb, the great Menudo
Yo Wolverine I'm down, Cyclops, Rhythm X
X we can back up The Four Horsemen
Toronto Blue Jays, field, just like Dave Winfield
Pick up your bat and go to third
I see that man at the plate, he's waitin home

	We are the Horsemen -- ENTER YOUR SPACESHIP! (3X)
	We are the Horsemen -- ENTER!

	While, returning back to my spaceship
	on my galactic horse, this is what happened..

[Ced Gee]
I get super bionic
No my name's not Mantronix, but I'm 4-H-M
Kickin flavor so steadily, so wickedy wicked
Can I switchedy switch it, I saw my troops last night
They said, "Ced could you kick it?"
I got mega in concert
Then I wrote a deposit, I hit my mega-mini
Zoom back to outer space, ten nine EIGHT seven six
five four three - the chain reaction
triggered the mad flows, then the rhymin got hyper
Plus I knew what they like-a, so I ripped it and rock it
Frequencies in the pocket, one blast two blast
Yes approximate, green in the chambers
The lights came on, infrared and exciting
Most don't know what I'm saying, galactic come beams
beams beams beams beams beams beams
beams beams beams...
Now it's classic the atom, no I don't mean The Phantom
Molecules in the mix, with lots of protons to hand them
Plus I'm billin the workers, secret charts led to Persia
When they're reachin their pick-up, I'ma crossover bezerker
We turn to the galaxy, the universe bothers me
From the Wild Wild West, I have a spaceship mentality
When I chill at the planet, magnesium flip
So I shake up the myolex, so what's left?
