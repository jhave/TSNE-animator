This for everybody... Who doesn't have a lot of money
But you have a little money, and when you get that little money...
You spend that shit

I work hard for my money, so hard for the money
Every time I get a little, I'm gon' spend it like a dummy
If my money was a NBA team and I was the, head coach of the squad
I'd be Jeff Van Gundy, wastin all of my funding
My wallet stays hungry
Mad like Pooh with the pot and no honey
Money wouldn't be funny if I stuck to my budget, but my motto is "fuck it"
Buy now, cry later, hopin that everything works out in my favor
I keep my receipt should I seek a release
From this contract of commerce, speakin of which
I'm the most at ease when I spend {?}
But don't trip, I'm a retail slut
Stimulatin the economy so I can get fucked
When I go out shoppin, I go for broke
I mean literally, there is no hope

Cause I'm a big time spender, let me buy that shit
Put it in the bag soon as I eye that shit
My pockets so broke, about to cry and shit
But do you think I care, it comes slow and goes fast (It's just not fair)
I'm a big time spender, let me buy that shit
Put it in the bag soon as I eye that shit
My pockets so broke, about to cry and shit
But do you think I care, it comes slow and goes fast (It's just not fair)

December 23. 2002
Around midnight, where were you?
Me, I was out for them Episode 2 Star Wars action figures
(Wait, back up my nigga, you can't mean toys?)
Hell yeah fool, me and a hundred white boys
We was waitin in line
Some buy to collect, some to sell online
(Man, hold up, you can't rhyme line with line)
Man, that's not the point
I spent two hundred plus before I even left the joint
If my mama only knew
I was out droppin notes when I owe her a few
My ass'd be through, You wouldn't be hearing this song today
Can you say, buyers remorse
Now I'm prayin that my CD's sellin out in the stores
Cause I hate being poor
I may have dropped a couple hundred but I'm one with the Force

And I'm a big time spender, let me buy that shit
Put it in the bag soon as I eye that shit
My pockets so broke, about to cry and shit
But do you think I care, it comes slow and goes fast (It's just not fair)
I'm a big time spender, let me buy that shit
Put it in the bag soon as I eye that shit
My pockets so broke, about to cry and shit
But do you think I care, it comes slow and goes fast (It's just not fair)

I mean, it comes and it goes, making funds from shows
The next day I'm at the mall buying tons of clothes
Eve though I get free shit, hella LRG shit
I'm calling El-P: Quick! Send me some loot
I'm over budget, I'm recordin (??)
When that check comes, I hit the swap meet and I buy some new Jordans
I'm often as lost in, trickin of my chips of,
Bootleg movies and, brand new kicks
I'm scan-da-lous, but I just can't help it
Call me what you want just, don't call me selfish
Always think of others, moms and my little brother
It's the thought that counts, so I keep'em in mind
As long as they stay out of my pockets, that's fine
As for my girl? Shit, what can I say?
Bought her a rice cooker and some lingere
I know it's for my benefit, but that's how it is
When you

Big time spendin, let me buy that shit
Put it in the bag soon as I eye that shit
My pockets so broke, about to cry and shit
But do you think I care, it comes slow and goes fast
And it's just not fair, BT$

Born to shop
