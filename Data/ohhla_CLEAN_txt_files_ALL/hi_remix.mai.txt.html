[Verse 1: Maino] (*Women in the background)
Look! Don't hide I see you hater
I'm a wave hi when I see you hater
I've been dyin to meet you hater
Please don't leave me I need you hater
This is for the ones that's been prayin I'm 'gon fail
They hatin, rahter see me back in the cell
But i ain't in the jail my nigga I'm doin good
Brooklyn we did it I'm keepin it all hood
Keep hatin I'm rollin I'm goin past you
Chicks like oooh I like him you see his tattoos
(*Go Maino!!!) Look at me went from Smack DVD's to MTV
Pants hangin down on BET
Still in the streets nigga you see me!!!!!

[Chorus: Maino] (T.I.)
Hustle hard, stack paper, it's alright, y'all hate us
It's nothin, we major, you see me, hi hater!!!!
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!
Ay Maino, tell them haters get ready!!


[Verse 2: T.I.]
Ay Maino, tell them haters get ready!!
I ain't got time, too busy I'm flyin
Over the Atlantics, three or fo' Hispanics
Strip dancin, no panties, askin me to take advantage
Just imagine all the fun that I'm havin (It's scary)
On average, I'm travelin, gettin that cabbage
Performin in London, then I'm landin in Paris (Hahaha!)
If I was you, frankly I'd be embarrassed
You carry no weight, words hold no merit
I talk big money, you cain't understand it
My picture won't fit on yo' cameras
Go win two Grammys, build cribs for a few families
THEN you can come back and holla at me 
God dammit, it's SAD - but I could give a damn what a sucka thank
Hustle hard, Grand Hustle, call us Hustle INC.
Me and Maino, Jay'll ate it, just like brothers think
it's all about the music 'til it escalade to other things
Sucka seen the Bankhead-BK connection
You can hate it, but respect or else get dealt wit, bitch!

[Chorus: Maino]
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!

[Verse 3: Swizz Beatz]
OK! OK1 Hi! my name is Swizz, your name is, hater
So you see 'em, hi hater!!!
On my watch, the Patek Philippe
I don't lose no sleep, cause I don't fuck with y'all haters
My car, the SLR, the engine through them like it's a guitar
I'll leave y'all haters in the dust by far
I'm designin planes y'all lookin at cars (LAMES!!!)
Yeah! I try to keep the peace
If you keep talkin the hawk 'gon slide in 'em
What's up?! They all want the cake
But I'm a chef so I gotta show 'em how to bake (GET 'EM!!!!)

[Verse 4: Plies]
Nine outta ten rappers - HATERS
They get emotional when they ain't got paper
When you get bigger than them then they hate ya
FUCK 'EM! 'Cause I don't owe 'em no favors
When rappers hot - THEY PRAISE YA!
When rappers get cold, they spray ya
We smarter than most, ask my lab-el
My first-week numbers, real major! (Dayum!)
Two hundred fourteen thousand sold, playa
Take by the minute now, half be my neighbor
I got a show, so I'ma talk to y'all later
Forty thousand a show - now hater!

[Chorus: Maino] (Jadakiss)
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!
(Hello!!! How y'all doin?)

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
Yo! A million dollars worth the ice on
My wife beater show the pythons
Drug money kept the lights on, and besides the gunsmoke
The hate in the air is what kept the nights on
They 'gon hate anyway screw bein nice to 'em
Till you send 'em some hot ones or you put the knife on 'em
Hi haters! It's me Jada
Might see me in the D with pink gators
Or I might be in the streets with three shakers
Ten head cracks in a row with sweet paper
Yeah I'm just tryin to get my cash
The LP is on the way though, Kiss My Ass!!!

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
Let 'em show NY, like the folks who make PlayStation
Yeah, I'm back, fresh off of hatecation
I let the haters take a break
Now I'ma let it out the bag like Jake the Snake
If it's one thing for sho', two things for certain
I'ma keep it up 'til my middle finger's hurtin
Naw - I ain't had a brush with beef yet
Some of y'all wake up hatin and ain't brushed your teeth yet
I come through, haters gotta know that I am paid
I be wavin like I'm on the float of the parade
Hola, bonjour - hi hater!
I keep it movin on hoes, call me vibrator
Los'

[Chorus: Maino]
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!</pre>
