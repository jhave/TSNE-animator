* This is a remake of Ed O.G.'s "I Got To Have It"

We gonna do it like this, yo this is Aceyalone
Giving a big shout out to Ed O.G. and The B.U.L.L.D.O.G.S.
Yo whole rock this, look

Yo brown is my complexion, I got that electric connection
Now who needs some protection?
We rocking hip-hop, come in and turn your gun off
Gave you the mic and off the head you couln't come off
I only say it cause nobody wants to shoot ya
I'd rather teach you science and work on the future
Aceyalone ain't not a phoney not by any means
And by any means necessary be supreme
I am the poet to flow with and get lyrical
I write songs like Smokey and the Miracles
I'm from L.A., city of the Big Bang
But everywhere around the world they screaming "Get thangs!"
And at the same time I'm screaming out "I want mine!"
It ain't nothing really new under the sunshine
But sometime you got to put away the fun time
Get it cause you only living one time, I got to have it

	360 knowledge of self              (I got to have it!)
	Records all over the shelf         (I got to have it!)
	The wind underneath my wings       (I got to have it!)
	Money and fancy things             (I got to have it!)
	The food for my family to eat      (I got to have it!)
	The raps that can ride these beats (I got to have it!)
	My own piece of this Earth         (I got to have it!)
	For everything life is worth       (I got to have it!)

I got to have it in the 2 triple O
It's either work nine to five or you rip a flow
Or rob a nigga, but how low can you go?
I ain't a thief, I just want relief for sho'
I got to get mine, no different from everybody trying to get theirs
So I was getting prepared
Instead of spitting shots through the air, maybe getting the chair
Yeah I got ta got ta, have it have it
Like peas and carrots, broccoli and cabbage
Bread and butter, now did I stutter?
Don't you utter another word, you mouth is in the gutter
And I can't take it, don't want nothing from you
And I can't stay, I got this bitch something to do
And it's more important than Michael Jordan
Or Operah Winfery or Billy Cosby
To the death like a kamikaze, huh, I got to have it

	360 knowledge of self              (I got to have it!)
	Records all over the shelf         (I got to have it!)
	The wind underneath my wings       (I got to have it!)
	Money and fancy things             (I got to have it!)
	The food for my family to eat      (I got to have it!)
	The raps that can ride these beats (I got to have it!)
	My own piece of this Earth         (I got to have it!)
	For everything life is worth       (I got to have it!)

See I want everything that I don't have
So don't laugh when I tell you that I want half
But I don't want your half, I just want my half
And on my behalf, put it on a phonograph
CD's tapes, packaged with a photograph
And respect the ancestors when we walk the path
Talk the math, speaking like a genuine
Bless the Gods, bless the mic, and then you rhyme
And keep it going until you end up at the finish line
And when you see the light beaming, then it's time
We kick a four or ??? this without a space ship
Don't want to take your life, I know I can't replace it
So while you're sitting around the house getting wasted
You know you're not using your full potential now you're facing
And plus, ain't nothing wrong with riding the bus
So put on your Nikes and kick rocks, I got to have it

	360 knowledge of self              (I got to have it!)
	Records all over the shelf         (I got to have it!)
	The wind underneath my wings       (I got to have it!)
	Money and fancy things             (I got to have it!)
	The food for my family to eat      (I got to have it!)
	The raps that can ride these beats (I got to have it!)
	My own piece of this Earth         (I got to have it!)
	For everything life is worth       (I got to have it!)

Uh, all right, do it like that</pre>
