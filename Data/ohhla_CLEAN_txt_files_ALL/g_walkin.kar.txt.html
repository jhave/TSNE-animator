CHORUS [Glenn Lewis]
If everyone could see just how I see
They'd Function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets
If everyone could see just how I see
They'd Function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

[Kardinal Offishall]
My God it's a beautiful day to just sit and enjoy blue skies
And all the brothers in the streets gettin' high
Give thanks for your life bcause Yo - things will change
Ghetto people suffering will soon in-herit the game
The last will come first and the first will come last
And the good will take a seat in the holiest of mass
And blast out the world sin, hard times we living in
I am trying to do the best I can living with my breddrens
The world is filled with negative and positive
Never judge a man what he is is what he is
And I am an ill bro blessed with an ill flow
With an opportunity to rep the T-dot O
And try to spread some of the blessings, lyrical dressings
And I am guessing that your listening to what I am addressing
Especially since I'm rhymiing from my heart
Trying to supress the craziness before it even starts
Yo every gun man has to have a soft spot
Every thug nigga has gotta have some heart
It's these things that I hold to be true
So I don't have to pray that they won't blast you

CHORUS

[Kardinall Offishall]
Yo!  I was touched by the real the other day
If my pops was here he would tell me enjoy every single day
And support your family cause blood comes first - for real
Nevermind about trying to sign a deal
Just do what you gotta do and do it like the best
Even when it seems that people C-Bn' for no reason
Don't study the treason, function like a G'
And with that, the world is ready steady f-ing with me
Admiring who I be, I take it as flattery
I must exemplify just what it is to be an emcee
I breathe in the tragedy
And breathe out a song of hope
Free from government, politics, lies, plus the Pope
The 5.0 sells dope, Police make nuff sales
We're taken out of the hood and locked up with no bail
But either way we get out and try to turn it around
You can't see it
But you feel it in the sound
You know dat!

CHORUS X2

[Kardinal Offishall]
I'm not a reverend, a preacher, V.P. or teacher
But still I gotta reach, and none can impeach
But the most high spiritual, virtually physical
Higher power more than capable to make miracle
In every black home, and in every jail cell
And in everyone of us to let the righteous set sail
And accept positioning, whether you a Christian, a Jew, or Muslim
Yo have faith in him!
The G's in the street know what I'm talking about
The man dem on the corner, surviving with no doubt
The kids in the park trying to keep things real
Yo who don't hear muss feel - you know that!
