Typed by: janis@betatesters.com

Remember this signature sound right here, coming up
Two seconds, one, one and a half, two seconds

[Shaq &amp; Peter]
Uh, Peter Gunz like what
Uh, and Big Shaq like what
Uh, T.W.Ism Fam like what
Quick, uh
Yo, Shaq

[Shaq]
Now who's that bringing that heat like D'Nero
Ride through your hood in a six-zero-zero
Cruisin' at the low speed of 10
You could take a look
Make a U-turn and see me again
Big Shaq drop crews like Quick
Got a little more G's
The one get 'em slick like Rick
Makin' all you playa hata's sick
Ballin', actin', rappin', stackin' chips
Got a personal vendetta
For those who oppose my dogs
Shut your windows and close your doors
Hold the walls, watch how the clean get gritty
Seven-One coming straight from the Brick City
And I'mma be Frank like Nitty
Even if I lose I'mma still get fi'ty
And you can ask Peter, call 'em on my Nokia
Or you can find him in the Bronx in a two-seater

1 - 	Now they can front and they can floss
	But they never payed the cost 
	To be an inner city player ba-by
	I like the way it's goin' down
	I like the way it's goin' down
	Now everybody they can hate
	But they'll never take the place 
	Of an inner city player
	I like the way it's comin' around
	I like the way it's comin' around
	No hata's allowed

[Peter]
Yo, well I'm too hot to handle
Too cold to freeze, Gunz
Ya never heard no rhymes like these
Maybe that's the reason I see wild G's
Bought a crib in the hill
And still push wild V's
Back up, gots to make way for the illest of the earth
Who represents the Bronx to the fullest
Pete be the realest
Some come try test I
To the east side, to the west side, to the best
I burn like Left-eye
Represent T.W.Ism to the death
I rep I, maybe cuz you slept
I came up to wake that ass
Get your girl on the dance floor and shake that ass
Now, I'mma tell you playa hata's this
While you at the door gettin' frisked
If you don't wanna be lyin' stiffs
Go up in your wallet get your tips
And leave that other garbage in your wips

Repeat 1

[Both]
It's gotta be T.W.Ism for life
It's gotta be T.W.Ism for life
(Make 'em dance, make 'em dance)
It's gotta be T.W.Ism for life
It's gotta be T.W.Ism for life
(Make 'em dance, make 'em dance)
It's gotta be T.W.ism for life
It's gotta be T.W.Ism for life
(G1, make 'em dance)
It's gotta be T.W.ism for life
It's gotta be T.W.Ism for life
(No hata's allowed)

[Peter]
Now me and Shaq is like Batman and Robin
And I'm robbin, straight muggin'

[Shaq]
Hey yo, Gunz stop buggin'
It's all about the Benjamins
And the women in Benz'es
And the lex'es, the girls wit the Rolex'es

[Peter]
Now I hear what you're sayin'
But these hata's tryin' to stop my flow
Sabotage things and block my dough

[Shaq]
Yo, just rock your roll, dog
And kill 'em wit silence
You never get nowhere using violence

[Peter]
Yeah, I know and you right
I'mma parlay, chill' and get cheddar
Laugh while they fall and I only get better

[Shaq]
And you'll be the last man standing
Fannin', me and my man
With smoke coming out the cannon

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

Yo, Quick make 'em dance
