"I wouldn't lie to ya, I want you to get ready to on
'Cause I got some more nasty ass shit to talk tonight"

I met this little girlie, she said her name was Shirley
Went to her house, pulled down her pants her pussy hairs was curly
She asked me was I nervous, I said you must deserve this
'Cause this dick in my pants is all yours and it's at your service
She rubbed on my penis, I mean you should have seen this
'Cause then she put my dick in her mouth and sucked it like a genius
My legs started shakin', my back started achin'
The way she rolled my dick I thought my dick was breakin'
I flipped her over and fucked her like Rover
But just before I bust my nut her man pulls up in a Nova
I caught my nut, you know what's up, so now I gotta go
Her man came in the front door and I'm out the back window
sayin'

(CHORUS)(4x)
I met this little girlie
Not like your man I'm just a freak

I met this other skeeza, her name was Lisa
The girl's pussy piping hot just like pizza
I fucked her in my automobile, the bitch was really sick
'Cause after I bust my nut she started lickin' on my dick
She started playin' with her clit and started lickin' on her fingers
She stuck my balls in her mouth start hummin' like a singer
Then she jumped on my dick, rode it like a roller coaster
Actin' like a tramp, but I guess she's supposed ta
I dropped her off at home and kept her panties for some proof
I didn't kiss the ho 'cause she had dick hairs on her tooth
I said

(CHORUS)

I met somebody moma, she pinched me on her booty
She looked at me said chickadee, damn a young cutie
I'm thinkin' to myself this ho must be too hot to handle
The next thing I know, I'm at her house drinkin' Jack Daniels
She put her hands in my hair told me to close my eyes
And when I opened 'em I was neckin' up in them creamy thighs
Well after I bust my nut I said I'm sorry I gotta go
She dropped to her knees and said please stay please
Damn it's a hit and run ho
Well this concludes my story, so I'll see you next time
When Esham's on the mic, funky fresh with a sex rhyme
sayin'

I met this little girlie
I met somebody's moma
I met this little girlie
Only in the day in the life of me
I met this little girlie
Can you believe all this shit happened in the same day?
I met this little girlie
Nah, fuck it, break that shit down
Ok baby, come here, I'm gonna do you
I'm gonna do you how you wanna be done baby
First lemme get my condom back open
All right baby</pre>
