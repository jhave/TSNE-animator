Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You seen that big ass whiteboy? Let that be the joker to start up some shit

Bitch it's: H-A-Y-S-T-A-K
Haystak Mak Million
But if you can't remember all that, bitch then just call me
Big Ass White Boy
Now that you know who I am, check this out
I'm a time bomb tickin like tick, tock
I'm a 13 year old with twin glocks
I'm the streets that decide if you ball or not
I'm the rubber band around every ballers knot
I'm the judge and the jury when you fuck with me
I'm the pin in the grenade, go on pull it and see
I'm a target, everybody got a bullet for me
But I'm a tough kid and aint nobody bullyin me
I'm a battle ship, take the banana clips
I'm 150 bricks, over 5 thousand zips
I'm a fire truck, back up and let me through
I'm ecstacy, more sensational and deadly too
I'm a preminition, deja vu
I'm a human being mothafucker, just like you
I'm the sedatives you take when you need some rest
I'm the pills that you pop just to ease your stress

I'm a
Big Ass White Boy
(I'm down for whatever. We can do it when a pen and a pad
or we can do it with a strap on the street. I don't give a fuck)
Big Ass White Boy
(I'll have all y'all bitches hooked up to machines n shit
Sound like a bunch of dump trucks backin up, keep playin)

Now I'm a C-Dub affiliate who's not with that silly shit
I'm brilliant, I'm Mr. Mak Million
And I'mma vent my fuckin anger till there's nothin in the chamber
I'm the board, the booth, the mic, the pen and paper
I'm the blood and the sweat of every independant rapper
I'm the fugitive runnin, who refuses to be captured
I'm that tatoo on your neck that'll let these bitches know
Who you are, where you're from, every fuckin where you go
I'm that strap under the pillow, that dead bolt on the door
That voice in your head that says: Fuck em, let's go to war!
I'm the reason that that gaurd dog is chained out back
Barkin when he sees intruders like: "Daddy, go get the mac!"
I'm breakin news
I'm a rave reveiw
I'm a rock AND a hard place. Either way, you lose!
I'm a head-on collision doin 75 (Tires screech, cars crash) Nobody survives

[Hook:]
I'm a
Big Ass White Boy
I'm the leaves on the trees
I'm the stripes on the street, c'mon
Big Ass White Boy
Ain-Ain-Ain-Ain't nothin shakin but my god damn car keys
Big Ass White Boy
I'm the leaves on the trees
I'm the stripes on the street, c'mon
Big Ass White Boy
Ain-Ain-Ain-Ain't nothin shakin but my god damn car keys

I'm a mad man with a maniacal mind
I'm the beginning of the end, I'm a sign of the times
I'm an anomaly, you're no problem to me
I'm a 4 time vet, you're a prodigy
I'm a son, a grandson, a father, and a brother
I'm paranoid, "All of you fuckers are undercover!"
Schizophrenic, you're dealing with four people
I'm good one second and then I just turn evil
I'm a straight up cat, I hate a snake and a rat
I'm a threat to say the least, let's just leave it at that
I'mma stand by my word type, same puffin herb type
Represent these whiteboys who livin that dub life
(Cracker) I'm a (Hoogie) I'm a (Wedo) I'm a (Devil)
I'mma kill you if you pull out that 38 special
I'm a WHITE BOY till they throw me in the ground
WHITE BOY, ha, hold me down now

Big Ass White Boy
I'm the leaves on the trees
I'm the stripes on the street, c'mon
Big Ass White Boy
Ain-Ain-Ain-Ain't nothin shakin but my god damn car keys
Big Ass White Boy
I'm the leaves on the trees
I'm the stripes on the street, c'mon
Big Ass White Boy
Ain-Ain-Ain-Ain't nothin shakin but my god damn car keys
Big Ass White Boy</pre>
