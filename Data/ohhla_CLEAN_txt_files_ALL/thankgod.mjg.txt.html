[Swizz Beatz]
Comin hard for ya
We doin this right here man
Givin it back
Alotta thugs in the street,
can't even do this right here man
But you know how we do
Hold it down, get it right, keep it tight
And most of all..
We thank God

[Eightball]
For my three sons, for my mom
For waking me up and breathing air into my lungs
For health and wealth and lots of love for myself
The chances in life to take the right steps
I done popped that thang, and I done been popped at
Stole, cheated, and lied
Survived when I could have died
Or somewhere locked up, my niggas locked up
That's why I pray to you, say what I say to you
Thank you for Swizz Beatz, to him you bring the heat
He brought the heat to us, we burn the streets up
Thank you for family and everyone that stuck with us
Gettin it crunk, and layin it down, and gettin to buck with us
Thank you for not lettin material things make me
Thank you for givin me the talent that my peoples see
Thank you for lettin my niggas live after gunplay
Thanks for forgiving me, cuz I don't do this every day

[Chorus]
[SB] I thank God!
[EB] For lettin me make it out the club
    That night all that fightin and shootin jumped off
[SB] We thank God!
[EB] For lettin me make my money on the block
    And get away when it get hot, uh
[SB] We thank God!
[EB] For them babies with them mommas who don't love 'em
    and they have to grow up, fast
[SB] We thank God!
[EB] For everything, all them little things
    For givin me my dreams, know what I mean?

[MJG]
I thank God for havin a mother and a father
To rely on for guidance when circumstances got harder
I'm a part of a whole race who thank God
For being able to be free and leave the plantation yard
And, I thank God for givin me the understandin to acknowledge him
Notice his footsteps and follow him
I'm walkin today, I'm talkin today
I'm feelin today, but on top of that I'm livin today
And, I thank God because he gave his only child
Would you give your only child? Think about that for awhile
And, I thank God for givin me my baby daughter
A roof over her head, and fresh clean drinkin water
And, I thank God for not being afraid to love
So all the love I give, I get back major love
And, I thank God for givin me all the blessings
To put a little piece of what we all think into this message

[Chorus] w/ MJG instead of Eightball

[MJG]
For all the times I thought I was in the worst situation
that I could be in
God helped me see in, them cloudy times
Them, "I wanna get rowdy" times
One of them, "They tried to bring the devil out of me" times
I thank God, for keepin my mind solid
And I respect my elders, if or if not they went to college
And, thank you Lord, for makin my bin and I swored
And I'm glad I don't feel like I have to kill to pay the bill

[Eightball]
I was blessed to be a story teller, CD seller
My niggas be them shady fellas, chasin yella
Greedy with they eyes beady, lives easy
Dispise those who rise easy, talkin freely
Thank you for them tricks who be, talkin down
Hatin me and think that I don't, get around
The rumors and the talkin all it do is bore me
Trick I done been through a true Holly-wood story

[Chorus] w/ Eightball

[Eightball talking]
Yea, Eightball, MJG
Swizz Beatz
Know wha'm sayin
Just wanna thank God
Simply, with the talents
That he blessed us with
Thank him, for the good things we celebrate
For the bad things that make us strong
Yeah</pre>
