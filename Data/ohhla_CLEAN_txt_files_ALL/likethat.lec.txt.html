[Lecrae]
Why you let him get you like that? (like that)
Why you let him treat you like that? (like that)
Why you let him stone cold play you?
He's a stone cold player
That's a no no no no

I heard he drive you crazy, but come on girl let's face it
He got your heart deceived, and you ain't thinkin' straight well...
God love you lady, you'll always be his baby
But you using your body, to go out and disgrace him
You need to leave him shawty, and you should leave him shortly
After this message, I'm guessing you think you need him shawty
No but you need God, your heart it please God
It be his satisfaction, and live to please God

He'll never lie to you, you know his perfect love
You know he died for you, he's got the perfect love
So let him go go go go
To sleep with him is a no no no no

Why you let him get you like that? (like that)
Why you let him treat you like that? (like that)
Why you let him stone cold play you?
He's a stone cold player
That's a no no no no

Why you let him get you like that? (like that)
Why you let him treat you like that? (like that)
Why you let him stone cold play you?
He's a stone cold player
That's a no no no no

Hey, you know Satan like to play you girl
Bitin' at that achilles, tryin' to shake you girl
He's so pragmatic, he's always back at it
That's why you gotta flee temptation, tell him "you can have it"
He's a trickster, loves to tell you that you need sin
Make you think you still a slave when you a free man
Always see men, but don't be ignorant
And fall pray to the liar in the lion's den
If you wait 'til you're alone on a date night
To figure out what's wrong in the late night
It's too late, right? You got caught up again
And now you back in sin feel like you can't ever win
But that's a lie again, you gotta raise up
Knowing God is the only one who can save us
Satan played us, it shouldn't amaze us
Crafty, taking advantage of the way we crave lust

Why you let him get you like that? (like that)
Why you let him treat you like that? (like that)
Why you let him stone cold play you?
He's a stone cold player
That's a no no no no

Why you let him get you like that? (like that)
Why you let him treat you like that? (like that)
Why you let him stone cold play you?
He's a stone cold player
That's a no no no no

Ladies, if Song of Solomon had never been written
And you never saw how men were supposed to cherish their women
And look at Ephesians 5 where they nourish their wives
Is he really that type of guy or are you rationalizing?
Our God deserves glory, greatest of love stories
He's more than movies and TV, believe me he knows that
We be provided his only Son when we ain't deserve it
He loves you on your worst days, you know he perfect
So hold on, and be content, you got the greatest, you single?
Don't give it away 'cause your life was made for the maker

What you got is a gift, don't waste it
Temptation be lookin' good, don't taste it
I told you back in '05 you should've waited, waited, waited
Haha, you remember wait? hey, if you lookin' for love, you need to find God.

Why you let him get you like that? (like that)
Why you let him treat you like that? (like that)
Why you let him stone cold play you?
He's a stone cold player
That's a no no no no

Why you let him get you like that? (like that)
Why you let him treat you like that? (like that)
Why you let him stone cold play you?
He's a stone cold player
That's a no no no no</pre>
