[B.G.]
Straighting up bitch nigga fore my cake cut loose
You gives a fuck bout me I gives a motherfuck bout you
If it's trouble you like it's trouble I bring
I'm a bosser I ride at night and I'm gonna let mines hang 
I sho discriminate at all (at all) beef I eliminate I play the game raw (game raw)
Sleep I advise you not to do when it's walk time
I have niggas catching they cut when I be slinging nine (uh uh)
Lil Wayne, Juvie and Turk that's who I roll wit (who) 
If I gotta lick that's who I go kick in the door wit (who)
Baby is who I drink that absolutely no wit (who)
That's my nigga that's who I always toss a hoe wit (oh)
You know B.G. about that shit em up and bang bang (bang, bang)
You know them niggas that I roll wit bout the same thangs (same thangs)
We've been thugging since way befo I got alittle fame (alittle fame)
We ahead of you niggas cause we got alittle chain (alittle chain)
Get out tha way nigga
  
Chorus: [B.G. &amp; Lil' Wayne]
Come around the wrong spot you will get shot
We make you drop it like it's ah, ah drop it like it's ah, ah
Come around the wrong spot you will get shot
We make you drop it like it's ah, ah drop it like it's ah, ah
You better get out tha way, them hot boys on they way
You better get out tha way, them hot boys on they way
  
[Lil' Wayne]
Yo, yo 
Seperate me from the fake
I'm from Highly Grove (Grove)
Pop the trunk to get my cake, low, cock, and load
I'ma guerrilla nigga walking wit a pump in my hand
M-11 around my back wit two glocks in my pants
Load a bag of that bups so I could hit a nigga up
Jump out tha back of the hummer wit something that goes "brrrrap"
Better vacate the premises
Cause we wipe out you peoples leave no witnesses
They call me the number one thug
See I be all about that hum bug
You play around and catch a dumb slug
Cause I be all out, pants fold down to my ankles
Think I ain't about function you get stump like Kirk Franklin
You get got, flip flopped tossed and tumbled
I'm running wit your life in my hands OOPS I fumbled
I'm a nigga from the troubles started up in Ruse
Better get out the way let my clique come through 
You heard me
  
Chorus: [B.G. &amp; Lil' Wayne]
Come around the wrong spot you will get shot
We make you drop it like it's ah, ah drop it like it's ah, ah
Come around the wrong spot you will get shot
We make you drop it like it's ah, ah drop it like it's ah, ah
You better get out tha way, them hot boys on they way
You better get out tha way, them hot boys on they way
  
[Young Turk]
A hot boy that's who I be's wodie
And I stay geared up wit tee bo's and ree's wodie
Forever thugging is in me so I'ma do what I do
Keep it real fuck wit me or my dogs and you get yo shit peeled
On the real we pack steel that'll kill 
Loose lips ain't shit so keep yo shit sealed
When we come through, scit scat or get hit
Don't matter what size you is got bullets that gonna fit
Call me the young thugger, thugged out everyday
Bout slinging nine at anytime I don't play
I run wit guerillas out that wild Magnolia
T.C. six and wheelers knock your neck off your shoulder (come around the wrong)
I'm from uptown where niggas get lowed down
Dump bodies and miss you and in the back it can't be found (come around the wrong)
It ain't no game nigga it's that guerrilla war shit 
Shot's at close range starts when it gets dark shit
Get out tha way
  
Chorus: [B.G. &amp; Lil' Wayne]
Come around the wrong spot you will get shot 
We make you drop it like it's ah, ah drop it like it's ah, ah
Come around the wrong spot you will get shot
We make you drop it like it's ah, ah drop it like it's ah, ah
You better get out tha way, them hot boys on they way
You better get out tha way, them hot boys on they way
  
[Juvenile]
Now motherfuck that, you got my money I don't trust that
Look black give me what's mine fo you get bust at
Now up that cause my trigga finger's be starving
Depause them, niggas that be jumping over margins
Now call them laws for me like he had a big crime too
This ain't no warning you gonna have to 
It's a reason niggas be doing what they do
I feel like you feel when somebody playing wit you
All time, I don't stop, ya'll don't stop 
Like Jordan Block we hit em up wit dumb glocks
We run shop CMAR stamp of approval
My nut's drop on your partna just like ?
It's so many niggas out here trying to shine 
Fucking wit a champ, running off at the same time 
Haters gonna come and go cause I'm a strong little nigga
See and see tell me what's going on little nigga
  
Chorus:[B.G. &amp; Lil' Wayne]
Come around the wrong spot you will get shot
We make you drop it like it's ah, ah drop it like it's ah, ah
Come around the wrong spot you will get shot
We make you drop it like it's ah, ah drop it like it's ah, ah
You better get out tha way, them out hot boys on they way
You better get out tha way, them out hot boys on they way
  
Come around the wrong spot you will get shot
We make you drop it like it's ah, ah drop it like it's ah, ah
Come around the wrong spot you will get shot
We make you drop it like it's ah, ah drop it like it's ah, ah
You better get out tha way, them hot boys on they way
You better get out tha way, them hot boys on they way</pre>
