Cause I'm a specializer, rhyme reviser 
Ain't selling out to advertisers 
What you get is what you see 
And you won't see me out there advertising 
See I like to party not drink Bacardi
'Cause I'm not looking to throw up on nobody 
Known for my spiel - a wheelie one wheel 
'Cause this is like having a delicious meal 

And well moving the crowd, well that's a must 
I got some words that apply to us and that's 
Mesmerizing, tantalizing 
Captivating, we're devastating 

If You 
If You 
Wanna Know

The real deal about the three 
Well let me tell you 
We're triple trouble ya'll 
We're gonna bring you up to speed

Here's one for the bleachers and the upper tier 
Versatile All-Temp-A-Cheer 
If you wanna drink call Mr. Belvedere 
Run this rap game like a brigadier 
I got kicks on the one, seven and eleven 
Snares on the five and thirteen 
Rhymes on time and that's the given 
We're hot on the disco scene check it check it 
Slow down with I-me, got to stop stingin' 
The source of the problem is at the origin 
You've got lyrics that have got me cringin' 
You're like a fish-wife, quit your damn whingin'

BAM super nature god damn 
Cerrone on the microphone I am 
Adrock a.k.a sharp cheddar 
My rhymes are better 
What the Helen in Troy is that? 
Did I hear you say my rhymes is wack? 
I'm beautiful you can't touch me 
If you pick a rose, well you might just bleed 

We're originators you can't feign 
Ignorance or pass the blame 
'Nuff rhymes coming out the brain 
'Nuff beats to drive you insane 
'Nuff moves to make your neck crane 
'Nuff skill to make the rhymes ingrain 
'Nuff heat to leave you in flames 
'Nuff style that you can't defame 
You see I walk like Jabba The Hutt 
With the style so new y'all be like what? 
Turn the party out like a bon vivant 
With the skill at will that I know you want 
On a hot day with the iced latte 
Devious like Wyle E. Coyote 
Hot to trot-ay or maybe not-e 
'Cause little did they know there was a baby in her body 

We're mesmerizing, tantalizing, captivating, and devastating 

If You 
If You 
Wanna Know 
Wanna Know 
The real deal about the three 
Well let me tell you 
We're triple trouble ya'll 
We're gonna bring you up to speed
