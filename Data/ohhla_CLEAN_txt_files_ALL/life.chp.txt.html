Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Chip Tha Ripper]
Yeah, ambitions of a nigga tryna see a better life
And everything I do I take my time and do it right
No felonies no kids I'm 23 how did I pass?
Ain't proud of shit I did I ain't get caught but that's my past
A grown man lives with decisions that he makes
Lay low watch out for schemin' hoes who try to get this cake
And watch out for these groupie niggas, they be Hella fake
Slowin' down this rap so you can soak up what I say
But lettin these niggas know Cleveland is back on the map and you niggas can't stop it
My shit is so undeniable niggas can't hate me cause they will look awkward
Fuckin' stick out like a sore thumb
Me and three bitches a foursome
Fuck it let's have some more fun
Hoes all up on the tour bus
Livin my dream you niggas is still tryna figure it out
The problem in my hood is flood not drought
Taking full advantage of these opportunities in life
Yeah I hear your plans but you gotta do that shit iight!

[Chorus 1]
This shit'll probably never be the same again [x4]
This shit'll probably nevaaaaa [x2]
This shit'll probably never be the same again [x2]

[Chorus 2: Chip Tha Ripper]
Every corner blowin' never know my next move
Ridin' smokin' thinkin' bout some shit I got to do
Life, mothafuckin' life
And I ain't never see none of this shit coming, did you?
Just tryna get my niggas on the same shit too
Life mothafuckin' life

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper]
Yeah, just copped my mama a Mercedes Benz
Don't ever let a nigga tell you chip ain't got no ends
Searching for, peace within and not no extra friends
These raps will make you feel like I'm your homie next to Kin
So familiar, so mothafuckin' real
My niggas who gettin this paper watch out for the haters who grip on the wheel
Was brought up by only the realest the killas and dealas and taught by the best
I don't need nothing that you got to offer my nigga I'm set
Take a wift of this aroma smoke'll put you in a coma
Make it more than all my teachers I told them keep that diploma
Don't need it motherfuckers watch how quick I get this paper
A lot of niggas claim they great but we know chip is greater
And they less than what I was way back in the day
Listen up close bitch soak up what I say:
Taking full advantage of these opportunities in life
Yeah I hear your plans but you gotta do that shit iight!

[Chorus 1]
This shit'll probably never be the same again [x4]
This shit'll probably nevaaaaa [x2]
This shit'll probably never be the same again [x2]

[Chorus 2: Chip Tha Ripper]
Every corner blowin' never know my next move
Ridin' smokin' thinkin bout some shit I got to do
Life, mothafuckin' life
And I ain't never see none of this shit coming, did you?
Just tryna get my niggas on the same shit too
Life mothafuckin' life</pre>
