Dwamn
Everybody's off up in the place
Like Dwamn
Women throwin' booties in my face
Like dwamn
Am I teccanina you can bet that
I am
Down for wham bam thank you mam
Like dwamn
This is for all of y'all killers
Who buy my records supporting all my dogs
When I'm in your town
Can I pub crawl with y'all
Go back home with your
Silky drawers baby doll
Exodus insanus nocturnus
Never your clan cannot learn us
y'all dead cold and I'm a furnace
With hella hot burners
I vibe like no other man when
I'm in another land
Use a rubber band
I don't love her man
Bell till I bail ride till I die
Yes I'm that gang related nigga yellin' why
Haters find it hard for them to see
How hard nina be
Tell me who you came to see

(Chorus)
TechN9NE TechN9NE
Been on TV been on CD's
Who been that mystery
What's my name
TechN9NE TechN9NE
And what you gain from me
Is pain from me
Tell me who you came to see

(repeat 2x)

(2nd Verse)
Bout to bring it back boss doggin'
boss ballin' bigger than beitnam
We brop bombs
On the boulevard Bickin' it
With my biggas bubblin' bouncin'
Big bootie blacks and blonds
Ronnz from Berlin all the way
To Don Juan's
Kansas City's me front lawn
One man beyond bomb
Come with crazy shit
Get your ass on the dance floor
You lazy bitch
In order to bring the bread cream in
I got to keep them heads ringin'
You trip and you's a dead demon
No spread semen leavin'
Groupies on the bed dreamin'
Her newlywed steamin'
With the infrared beamin'
Do I have to get my gun
For this punk spit one for this punk
Villain I ain't bought
To have ta run from this punk I dump
Nigga what I keep it crunk
And cranked lumps in banks
Your girl's getting' pumped and spanked
Who you aim to be
Who you claim to be
Do you aim to be
Insane bane with me
Can you hang with me
Man claim strange with me
Dangerously
Then tell me who you came to see

(Chorus)
TechN9NE TechN9NE
Been on TV been on CD's
Who been that mystery
What's my name
TechN9NE TechN9NE
And what you gain from me
Is pain from me
Tell me who you came to see

(repeat 2x)

(3rd Verse)
You better blow that shit out
If it ain't greeny green
Better throw that shit out
Kind of funny
How I come nina stun niggas
Out of money
Then I run with a gun trigger
Get us in a club killer
When I am in it
Women give us love with 'em
I'm a damn menace
We keepin' it hot
Don't cock the glocks
If you came to make it hop
You're at the spot drop
We smoke weed
And we drink rum up teccanina
Sex we don't stop till
We bust nut teccanina
Ain't no change in me
Ain't no sugar veins in me
Ain't no petty kiddy games in me
If you're with me
And ain't ashamed to be
Flamed with me
Tell 'em tell 'em
Who ya who ya came ta came ta see see

(Chorus)
TechN9NE TechN9NE
Been on TV been on CD's
Who been that mystery
What's my name
TechN9NE TechN9NE
And what you gain from me is pain from me
Tell me who you came to see
