(K-OS)
(Masquerade) One two, see this?
Right here this is heat, yo, yo
Massive massive

(Hook: K-OS)
There's something deep inside
That's telling you that love's so much more
This is just a masquerade
When everything's alright
You know it's time for the writing wars
If it's just a masquerade

(K-OS)
When I feel the way of my lost innocense
Looking for emotions that are fallacy
Everything is waiting on that dominance
Hoping for new opuses and alibis
And I'm with you, oh ohohohoh
If I could starve from falling
And I bet you, oh oh silenced the
Voices in your head but there's no place to go

(Hook: K-OS)
There's something deep inside
That's telling you that love's so much more
This is just a masquerade

(K-OS)
I sit back with the microphone
Watchin' these MC's turn to actors
Producin' all the factors
That flip life, into a masquerade
We like a bunch of manakins
Battery operated, inoculated
With five sentences connect us to the Earth
Rich sinners since the days of my birth
For what it's worth, dissuaded love
I'm steadily spreadin' love over the beat down
Let's meditate and feel the heat now
Like beautiful rain, on the desert plain
Cause the sun parch the ground on the weak sound
I break it down, to elements H to O
A place to go, that you can't escape the flow
Does not exist, I love the truth so I persist
Intelligent men? Or just "Gorillas in the Mist"
Clenchin' a black fist, for the size of dollar bill
I leave the space so you can think about it now so just chill

(Hook: K-OS)
(There's something, there's something deep in)
(There's something)
There's something deep inside
That's telling you that love's so much more
This is just a masquerade
When everything's alright
You know it's time for the writing wars
If it's just a masquerade

Black shit, ration, tryin' to step up
But they can't even cash it
Kick that shit

(Kamau)
(First saved message)
In this venture, nothing gained
I've only just touched the surface
Once nervous, when writing for a worthless purpose
It was once more than this, before the heart left the beat
The soul left the speech, I'm still trying to reach
My niche, and teach the love again
Inside the hate of a present day
Got stepped after, being genuine we're swept away
Before the importance of diamonds, bells
And a platinum place, fallen from grace
Not my campus with another trace
Of the same thing I came in, this thing is worth saving
Standing in the pockets holding tongues of what I'm saying
Blaming myself only for supporting what they're playing
I may peek through the storm, but now it's raining
Unchanging of late, it's hard to be creative
Although creating is native to me, I tried to be
Even patience couldn't save it, from the days of pages
They couldn't believe I would say this
No longer without wings, Kamau is what my name is
Too many undermind, what I underline
Placing my poetry underneath their making of rhymes
It was a creation of frustration
Brown bricks or blank slates
Subway trains and cardboard bound with masking tape
It was the sound of the evening, the way the day grew late
Words tumble from lungs over my tongue
And gave a new taste to my fate
It doesn't even matter how the chatter would paint us
With love on our side they could barely stand against us
Um, what up? Uh Kheaven, what's goin' down?
Um I got your message, and uh yeah, basically call me back
Basically call me back and tell me
Sorry about the length of the message, but you know
You feelin' it? Aight man peace
