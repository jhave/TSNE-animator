Song:   Tea Time
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I sit and drink some tea with grandma
And talk about how much she isn't getting
We just pray, hope the blessings collect
Yesterday I missed the call from my cousin collect
He upstate, I hope I catch him on another day
But I ain't trying to see him, in a fuckin' round with the gay
One look at my granny, I thought for sure sinking
Damn... you know what I'm thinking
Nah... I see you're kinda slow
Cause I ain't serving shit, but this flow
And this beat is like a pack, flow like crack
I'm a do 'em one better, flip this sect
So these bars is fat nickels, got my first sale
Bought the kids popsicles, the game's so fickle
Got me going and my lawyer fair to cop swishers
Narcs pull us over, talking 'bout where's the pistols
And all we tryna do is just get a couple conies
Cause same shit in the crib man, you lucky we're baloney
Lonely inside living in a quarter house
Bunch a niggas pressed like a church lady blouse
Wonder why all these niggas running to the south
But in these 60's niggas came to where?
Wonder why all these motherfuckers running to the south
Cause in the 60's our elders came from there
Yeah...

I sit and drink some tea with grandma
And talk about how much we isn't getting
We just pray, hope the blessings collect
Yesterday got a call from my cousin collect
He upstate, said he straight, niggas locked
Wroten bars for the mixtape
But I'm far from paid, and the bills don't fade
So if you don't play might be locked in the cage
Nah I play the stage, and the hour's never flexible
Been doing this since granny made me eat my vegetables
Threw away my school schedule...
These niggas lack testicles...
Say what they want, don't do what they feel
Sometimes I look at shit like is it really real?
Same question Meth asked in '94
Had the hilfiger bubble coat...
Crushed on tiffany but she wasn't feeling me
Cause she was in the 12th grade sipping on hennessey
Now she a memory of what she once was
Now if you see her you wouldn't touch her with a buzz</pre>
