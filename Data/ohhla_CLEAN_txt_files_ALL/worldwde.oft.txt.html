[Intro: Flip Side]

O.F.T.B
1996
Low M.B
Bustop
Flip Side
Let's take it world wide
Serve 'em

[Verse One: Flip Side]
Suge Knight got the sack
Everybody on the streets and in the industry knows that
They use to say we was trash
Until we cracked them like this, and shot them like that
Now I'm starting to get my paper
Bumped it to some fool's who said we wouldn't be major
Player hatin' up and down
Not knowing there was Bounty 'ru's
All around
I know you fool's can't stand me
As I bail with Rondo with Sammy
In hopes to get a Grammy (That's right)
We ain't shaking Hollywood we still thinking about the shit that's jumping
off in the hood
I'm hearing cheer's from my family friends and my peer's
1996 O.F.T.B. we in here

[Chorus: Mich'elle]
Time after time
Day after day
Have to prove myself
I'll be the one survivor, last motherfucking left
Time after time
Day after day
Have to prove myself
I'll be the one survivor, last motherfucking left
Time after time
Time after time

[Verse Two: Bustop]
Got my checks now watch me take off
What's up now
(Keep it going Flip you coming off)
All my life I been surrounded by danger
Sneaky bitches
And fake banger's
Change my life and chose a new route
Lay down my thought's, know they being bought
Cause I don't want to be like him
Mind fucked, with no fucking ends
So day by day I'm on a kamikaze
Ain't no nigga, ain't bitch ain't no body fin'a to stop me
I'll leaving mystery, I'm making history
With every motherfuckin' word that I speak

[Chorus: Mich'elle With Kurupt talking:]
O.F.T.B. world wide stampede
Came to give these motherfucker's what they need
Outlawz
Till the day we die
From the streets of Watt's going worldwide (Wide, wide)
O.F.T.B. world wide stampede
Came to give these motherfucker's what they need
Outlawz
Till the day we die
From the streets of Watt's going worldwide (Wide, wide)

Time after time
Time after time
Time, after time
Time after time

[Verse Three: Low MB]
You niggas better realize
That I'm rolling with the Bustop and the Flip Side
And for you niggas not knowing
If it's fight fuck this mic's and these fist's start flowing
In 50 states they've been waiting for this bottom shit
While you be sleep we be up making fucking hits
And all our shit
Be true to life stories
No nut's, no motherfucking glory
It's a war in this industry
If you ain't down with me then you my motherfucking enemy
So I'ma have to bring the drama
fuck you, your whole family and your baby's mama
So are you with me or against me
I'm rolling with the whole
Death Row family
From the bottom to the top nigga
fuck what you saying, it's all about Watt's nigga

[Chorus: Mich'elle With Kurupt talking:]

[Verse Four: Yaki Kadafi]
See as the Outlawz we run the world
To my block getting that Emmitt Smith on cop's ditching rock's to the curb
And on the parties where we go or whiling on the streets with the shotty
sippin' the notty
As long as you niggas really know
And I hustle to get that dough
Fast money or slow
Even pill's lead to tab's
Or robbin' they rab's for blow
I dropped out and learnt my math's got to get the gat to mash and get that cash
From rap book to stash
For all my people's that passed
Didn't last to see us grow up
Two of us back on the block running from task's get your dough up
Cause see I
Managed to stay alert on point like Magnum P.I
I ain't scared to D-I-E
Cause there'll be nothin' on me

[Verse Five: Tupac]
World wide I'm a Don in my own rhymes
Got the call niggas gonna bomb with a strong rhyme
Watch me bank on motherfucker's run for cover
Outlawz till we die so we thug brother's
Let them understand it's a family thing
I hate the Fed's
Eating good drinking Champagne and breaking bread
This is for my dog's in Watts and shit
Tupac got your back who can stop the hit
And even with these cop's if they steer for me
I'll die screaming motherfucking M.O.B
Now did you hear me
Spitting clearly
Niggas fear me
Too next to me not to hear me
Slide on these other buster's
Ride on these motherfuckers please
Recognize Death Row G's
We can get wild
But understand just who got us
Rocking with that Operating knocking out the bottom

[Outro: Kurupt]
O.F.T.B. world wide stampede
Came to give these motherfucker's what they need
Outlawz
Till the day we die
From the streets of Watt's going worldwide (Wide, wide)
O.F.T.B. world wide stampeed
Came to give these motherfucker's what they need
Outlawz
Till the day we die
From the streets of Watt's going worldwide (Wide, wide)

And you don't stop, yeah
Kurupt from Tha Dogg Pound down with my niggas from the O.F to the T to the
straight to the B nigga what?
Death Row yeah, you don't stop</pre>
