[Intro/Chorus]
I hate that snitch, I hate that snitch {*3X*}
I hate that snitch, I hate that sniiiiiiitch~!

[Verse One]
Now listen up, all you hustlers - I got a story or two
I got to tell you 'bout these snitches, because they're snitchin on you
See we're known for 5th Ward and we take no jive
You're like a cat - but guess what - you don't have nines lives, and

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
NOW, you've, GOT, too
Beware of the snitch - homeboy they smile in your face
Within a few damn hours, he'll piss all over the place
You've got some snitches, homeboy and that's without doubt
But when the press comes out, he'll end up snitchin himself
Because I robbed, I stole, yo and Red got away
We all got got, you know why, because of snitchin away, and

[Chorus]

{*Scarface samples*}

[Verse Three]
And there's, snitches everywhere, and they brought in two
You got caught, crackin and they told on you
But me and dis homeboy was real cool you know
I took his girlie off with me and she gave me a blow
Now just imagine what happened, the very next day
The other fella snitched us on because they couldn't get no play, and

[Chorus]

[Verse Four]
This is the end homeboy, well it's last but not least
Jukebox is gonna hip you to the jams we seek
Do-do-do-do-do-do you know that dance - yeah they call it the wop
But those snitches have a dance they call the crimstop, and

[Chorus]

{*Scarface samples*}
"I never trusted him, I never trusted him, I never trusted him"
"For all I know he had me set up"</pre>
