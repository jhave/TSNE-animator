[Chorus: Juicy J]
We looking for them J-Lo booties big ol ass round and fat
Let me sqeeze it, Let me squeeze it
When she take it to the floor I want to hit it from the back
Let me sqeeze it, Let me squeeze it

We looking for them J-Lo booties big ol ass round and fat
Let me sqeeze it, Let me squeeze it
When she take it to the floor I want to hit it from the back
Let me sqeeze it, Let me squeeze it

(All you ladies pop your pussy like this) Yeah
(Move your body don't stop don't miss)

[Frayser Boy]
Mane she got me in the zone when I watch this broad pass by
Been becking at this bitch all night but this my last try
I am trying to see what's up
You know a nigga trying to fuck
If you are a girlie girl then I'll settle for a suck
You got a thug on the scene
In the club on some green
A nigga ain't Ginuwine
But trying to get up in them jeans
Frayser Boy that's the name
Fuck another I'm the mane
Get you drank after drank get you drunk I'm trying to bang

[Crunchy Black]
Where ya at whoa
Where ya at whoa
CB wanna hit you from the back whoa
And when I grab your girl don't holla let go
Cause I like a girl with a big back bro
I mean she stacked low
And when I jacked yo
I shoot that thang like I'm shooting off a Mac whoa
It ain't no game I play when it come to D
And if you get it from me then you getting dope D'd

[Chorus]

[Juicy J]
Juicy J is pimpy
Not always all friendly
I wanna get that chewin like from Monica Lewinsky
She can call me (papi) hanging low and (floppy)
When I get behind that ass she tell me (boy you got me)
I don't care for size four
I just want a size more
Big ol J-Lo booty what a wedding good she sized or
Bring it up (Bring it up)
Back it back (Back it back)
Make it wiggle (Make it wiggle)
Make it jiggle make it clap

[Lil' Wyte]
Let me squeeze it
Ain't no teasing
Go to get it
I done seen it
Soon as she drop it on the floor
It's over for this one this evening
I might leave it
Sticky drippin up out of the side of her secret
Victoria probably gone be pissed when ever she sees it
But once you got me going it's on
Ain't no reason for you be wanting to go home
You gotta give it to me nice and round that big J-Lo booty
I need it badly
I'll be happy
Drop it off she a cutie

[Chorus]

[DJ Paul]
(Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)
I'm looking for them J-Lo booties
But I ain't Ben Affleck
And I ain't Diddy
And I ain't the dude who taught her to dance like that
I'm just a dirty dirty down south gold mouth nigga
Can't remember the last time I only saw six figures
I bang a bad big booty thang daily
I did more stars than that boy Carson Daily
And if you nice you ain't even gotta pay me
But if you ugly hit the bank and try to save me

[Lord Infamous]
I know this broad
She lick the Infamous so good she make me wanna cry
And if she wasn't such a dog I'd hit her doggy every night
They put the "free" in freak
They put the "ut" in slut
They put the "amp" in tramp
And catch you when I take off the glove
She give brain insane
I call the dame a brainiac
Let me meet the family
All the women nymphomaniacs
She got the biggest brown round that you ever seen
Lord the maniac I make her hit the club and make that cheese</pre>
