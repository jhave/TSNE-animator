[Intro: Method Man]
Aight, Staten Island what up
Yeah, Long Island what up, Come on
Jazzy Jeff yall, Phillie what's good
Haha, New Jersey
Yo I just had a Phillie cheese steak, That shit was good as a muthafucka

[Method Man]
Yo, Yo, Who do it till the death
Let the magnificent Jeff go do it to the rest
You see the difference, Assumin we a threat
Yall just impotent, Aint no use of screwin with the best naw
I wrote a 16 a throw it in a tech
Shootin game at these fools now for foolin with a vet yeah
It's Mr. Mef really, Who did you expect
Another shit talkin MC, With booty on the breath naw
Let's smoke somthin, Let your dude hold somthin
And this dudes coke runnin till the blue coats commin yes
Cruise still stuntin, Radio still frontin
And the stuff they still bumpin got me numb, I feel nothin Jeff
So I'ma get it like I spit it
Get my glass you can fill it to the rim with the realest and
I'm talkin back when Biggie Smalls was the illest
And the boys from Cypress Hill said how I could just kill a man

[Chorus 2X: Method Man]
Already knowin how we go, Let's get at your people
I'm flowin these streets know, I hold it down
And for the channel, The G code Jeff
Just let the peeps know I'm reppin the east coast, So hold it now

[Method Man]
Until my niggas get room enough to breath
I'ma break down the leaf, My brotha crush the weed
Not Puff Daddy, No boy I puff the trees
In a room full of crackers I might cut the cheese
They called me Mr., I got what you need
And a bag of sour dezz, You aint gotta pluck the seeds naw
So hit the peddle, I'll bring you up to speed
Nearly smashed up to beamer, No more cognac for me
See I'm in my backyard still cleanin
All the fiends still fiendin, Better deal with the demons and
I'm just bein rash, I'm like what's the meanin
Cause as far as MCin I aint likin what I'm seein man
Nah, So M-E-F's on some other shit
Feel it like that first piece of pussy, Fell in love with it
Yall know what up with it, If I'm with my brother get
Money, Clothes, Hoes, 24s on the mother ship

[Chorus]</pre>
