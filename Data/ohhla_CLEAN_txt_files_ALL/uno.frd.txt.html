[Intro]
Yeah, fa'sho'
Uhh.. fuck the competition nigga
Yeah..

[Freddie Gibbs]
Uhh - fuck niggaz, spark the weed up
Shit been watered down, the rap game they need us
Real niggaz to intervene, they interject
Got a bitch naked, got some neck in the 'Vette and I'm fin' to jet
Fin' to get fucked up in this bitch that's on fiend
Poppin yoppers, fuck the coppers, sell narcotics, nigga we bring that on in
Bitch, I'm a problem, got your columns full of losses no wins
Gary gangsta, fuck with Chicago niggaz out that Low End
Much love to my nigga Mikey, threw muzzles off in they mouth
Nigga hittin licks where we reside for unspecified amounts
Stuff the mattress full of merch, .40 calibers in the couch
Guess I'm on the hot seat, rob me won't make it out
I could make her sharpen my attitude, might just make her pout
Find me charming 'til she really found out what I was about
My recreation, occupation, invadin a nigga house
Smokin and ridin, I ain't high when I'm drivin, I highly doubt
And I - don't believe these rap niggaz
You can front for your fans but I know it's an act nigga
Judge a man by his character and not by his wealth
A real G, I never kissed niggaz or shot myself
Gangsta Gibbs

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm number one, number one with a bullet
Bring your guns, fifty shots when I pull it
Make 'em run, make you motherfuckers bleed
Only fuck with real G's, public enemies

[Freddie Gibbs]
Probably be murdered for some shit that I said
I'd be a legend out this motherfucker breathin or dead
But y'all don't hear me, these uppity bitches they all fear me
Fuck a diamond on your finger, I guess it's the dog in me
Ain't no hog in me, I'm swine-free, suckers the Iron Sheik
Nine G's for the nine piece, how you define me?
A student of the thug nigga, drug dealer college
Majored in robbin and graduated with honors
Seein plenty dudes in Dolce Gabbana's and marijuana fog
Niggaz trying to vulture the culture, motherfuck all of y'all
Dick blowers, rapper reality shows
Y'all just attention whores
Don't give a fuck if I set a record or win awards
I'm just blessed to be out here livin life
Giving these niggaz hell, so records with everything I write
Shit got me wishin DMX had never hit the pipe
Pun ain't never died and Big L was still here to bless the mic

[Chorus]</pre>
