[South Park Mexican]
(Verse 1)
My sweet 'Llac fall back, just creeping on three wheels
A bitch to my right cocked giving me cheap thrills
I see meals
Coming down my path
In the ghetto cat's wrath, making math
I'm the last to blast, on that ass, now you the past
It's no joke, you get smoked like buddah grass
Who the fastest
Punk, I'm like Cassius
And when I crash this, you catch
WHIP lashes
Bitch, I'm on a mission, to listen
And give descriptions
Hung G's in my hood and their intentions
I hear gunshots ringing like hell's bells
I see drug sells, check out my thug tales
Fuck jails, bank swells keeps hella grip
And I can sell dope on ice
And never slip
They serving Kibbles N' Bits while I'm cuttin' bricks
Save my crumbs for the ones who sucking dicks
I may get rich on the ditch, you quick snap
I left that cut, now they wonder where the bricks at
My green shit stacks
Still clip packs
Thirty-six
Lead homies, so don't trip jack
It's the wetback, hittin' on the bongs
Son, in the long run, I'll be the strong one

Hook: South Park Mexican
If you step in my hood, bitch, you will get blasted
It's nothin' but that
H-Town G-funk
If you step in my hood, bitch, you will get blasted
It's nothin' but that
H-Town G-funk

Repeat Hook

[South Park Mexican]
Yeah, this for all them hustlers in Hillwood, South Park
Hun

(Verse 2)
I told ya
Boy, you must have caught amnesia
Tryin' to jack, now you're on your back, breathin' anastesia
You got blasted, cause you trespassed it
They never lasted
In the game I mastered
You stupid bastard, tell me what's your final word
Before I let this lead tip, hit your spinal cord
Oh, you was ready, just beggin' to gank me
Now your ass is just dead and stanky
I put my foot, in your shit like the hokey pokey
Leave the scene, now everything's okey dokey
Your homies know me
But they won't FUCK with this
Cause now they know
That I can sure BUCK a bitch
I'm the macker, plus the gun packer
So you little jackers
Best stick to [{*crackers*}]
Cause fucking with this Mex gets your neck broke
Stuck like Chuck
Straight fucked, and in check, loc
Cause I think fast, when I'm in the slow lane
Get in my domain, and fall back with no brain
So don't raid
Or try to rain on my parade
Cause I'm strapped from my blade
To my grenade

Repeat Hook Twice

(Verse 3)
My sweet Texas, restless
Wantin' to ride Lexus
Check this or flex this
I get wreckless
Unbelievable, lyrical, cynical
Here we go, Mary-go-round, I down critical
Street stamina, dammin' a cop
Slammin' a punk
And jammin' my
Funk
I'm the man with the skill, for real
Guard my grill with steel
On Sundays, I kneel
On my knees to Jesus, please seize us
Cause my boy's in trouble
And he needs us
Got a bat, my homie's on the double
Punks want trouble
I Bam Bam
Rubble
Still the son of a gun, havin' big fun
Come and get some
I leave you wet, mon
Fill your lead with an infra red
I put the best to bed, they call him Dead Fuckin' Fred
Shed my skin like a snake on a vine
Climbin' on the crime side, comin' around the blind side
We fall in ranks like a motherfuckin' pyramid
And I'm the top block, will I stop
Never did
Make it past the ninth grade
But got life made
Chose that dope, and I hope, I picked the right trade

Repeat Hook Twice</pre>
