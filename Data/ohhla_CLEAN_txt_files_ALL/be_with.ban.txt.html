[Intro: David Banner]
Ha Ha! Let's do it!

[Marsha Ambrosius] (David Banner)
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!! (David Banner, 9th Wonder)

[Verse One: David Banner]
One for the money yessir two for the show
Three for all the ladies that's standin outside my do'
Yellin OH!!!! It's that Mr. David Banner
If I say yes she want me to beat her like I got ani-mosity
Then walk to the bus with a pimp's velocity
Then open up my hand and say y'all all can come with me

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius] 
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Two: David banner]
I got a bar on the bus we could discuss future plans
Me and you and all your friends we could visit foreign lands
Like showers in Okinawa, barefoot in Thailand
Or we could sop up some biscuits and syrup with bare hands
That's back in Mississippi
All you gotta do is close yo' eyes and come with me girl

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius] 
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Three: Ludacris]
LUDA!!! I told her, I got the chips if you got the dip
She said when I dip then I better be equipped when you keep my hand on her hips
I told her gimme all you got until your givin is gone
She said her love's eternal and I won't be livin that long
Well! I'm not immortal and I swear I'm no wimp
'Cause I died twice and keep comin back as a pimp

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius] 
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Four: David Banner]
Too close for comfort too close for home
You too close to the front of the stage to be alone
Here's my number when I'm gone you can call me on the phone
I don't buy you bein shy you supposed to be grown
This is more than a pass Hail Mary's bein throwned
Line four up on the line and head to the end zone girl

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius] 
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Five: Ludacris]
Now put your hands up in the air yeah put 'em where I could see 'em
Put 'em up anyway 'cause where I'm 'bout to take you you don't need 'em
I treat 'em forever please 'em they screamin, squeezin and breathin hard
Believe in Luda like you a like you believe in God
Hallelujah!!! Please pass the offerin
You so wet that I be comin up for oxygen

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius] (Ludacris)
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!! (Don't worry baby I can swim)

[Verse Six: David Banner]
Those huge baby eyes, keep runnin off at the mouth
And they tellin me, how you love these rappers from the South
And I was thinkin how splendid I just wish that your girl wasn't so long winded
We could go to Planet Lack
Where the land is made of leather you could lay off on your back
When the clouds are made of tint so you it stays black, girl!

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius] 
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!

[Verse Seven: Ludacris]
Look! I was one of the best guys (What) Not one of your ex guys (What)
If you get drunk don't worry I'll let your sex drive
I keep my hands on the wheel if you put it in reverse
Buckle your safety belt, I'll put you in a hearst
Your frame will strain eyes to women the same size (OH!)
You so fine I'm 'bout to put you in my Fave Five

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius] 
I was meant to be, with you!!!!!!!</pre>
