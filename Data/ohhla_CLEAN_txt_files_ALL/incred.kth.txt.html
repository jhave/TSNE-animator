[LL Cool J]

I'm incredible, I mix up shit like cake mix
Keep it blazin hot, rhymes  burn to keep you frost bit
MC's is assed-out cause they lost it
Peep my foundation, the way I reinforce it
I monitor movements, precisely
Makin niggas hit high notes, like the Eisley's
Finally, some bitches I can touch up
Tie em to the grill of my Six, pop the clutch up
Hush up, I rush up, inside your cut
Make you puss up, then bust up, cause my shit bumps
This Don's Trumps, kill straight cats and all chumps
Cause "Life is like a box of chocolate," Mr. Gump
Uh, the ultimatum, lets abbreviate em
LL platinum again, don't you hate 'im?
A thin line between darkness and sunshine
Five Percenters that was raised on swine
Known to be wise, and you wise to understand
Bringin me drama is a handstand in quicksand
I've been hot so long, I'm immune
Your rap career get cut short like Poom-Pooms

Chorus: Keith Murray (LL Cool J)

Now, from the streets to the suites and all around the world,
 they all recognize we (Incredible)
We can stand in the water and can't get wet,
you can bet your last dollar we (Incredible)
We gets it on in the worst way
All the homeboys and the girls say we (Incredible)
From one brother to another
They agree with each other, lyrically we both (Incredible)

[Keith Murray]

Adios, mios, Montageune
We're too hot to hold and too bold to be controlled
Your only skin-deep, my ugly comes from the soul
I find the leaks, and E plug the holes
I have more beef than filet mignon
But got smart, and flushed the bullshit down the ?como?
Rappers just started rappin last week, get a deal next week
And go platinum next month
But pass the blunt, so I can stay hy- like -dro
Don't act like you don't know, I'm about to fly a flow
I'm three from three from a three-point land
With more devastation than a nigga can withstand
Remember me? Untouched by any emcee
I add verbal assault to your mental injury
Cause I'm the vogit, toat it, quote it
Five-0 said freeze, man I blowed it
Ryhme strategies, no one's bad as this
I sew up the populace like a seamstress
A prisoner, doing time and the bit
A grown man, and don't play with no kids; I'm incredible!

Chorus 

Lyrically we are both (Incredible)</pre>
