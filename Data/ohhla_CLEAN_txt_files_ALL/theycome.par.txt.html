Yeah, niggas come through
Niggas come through
They come through!
Niggas come through
These niggas come through
P.A.
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Mr. Mo]
First it's Billy, then it's Henny
My name Lenny, you don't get any
I knew this bitch, now she was good and plenty
But the only thing wrong: breath dirty as Kenny
You met her at the bar and you bought her a Remi
But little did you know, she the neighborhood crow
Hoe watched you flash your watch at the store
Bet you bottom dollar that this nigga got more
Now the plot has been laid down
This Busta Brown nigga straight from out of town
A Kangol hat is a hustler's crown
And these princes, southern dukes, you can't dust 'em down
When niggas come through, they come through
Little individuals fuck with you cuz you fuck-with-able
And when the situation critical
I push the gas to the floor mat
Slip through the cracks

When they come through, they come through
When they come through, they come through
When niggas come through they come through
There really ain't nothing you can do
But when they come through they come through

When they come through, they come through
When they come through, they come through
When niggas come through they come through
Be ready if you want to
But when they come through they come through

[Big Reese]
Now pimps, hustlers, gangstas, cops
What we got in common?  We all sold Glocks
Give me mine off the top
Remember how we ran the block till shit got hot?
Mom and them said "Y'all asses better stop"
Before somebody gets shot
Somebody got sprayed, them was the old days
These are new days, but ain't shit changed
Just my angle, learned how to hold a Ruger plus the Calico
I shoot up your Esco, plus your Regal
Wherever we go, its a CP party
P.A. and Attic Crew, we come through and get it started

When they come through, they come through
When they come through, they come through
When niggas come through they come through
There really ain't nothing you can do
But when they come through they come through

When they come through, they come through
When they come through, they come through
When niggas come through they come through
Be ready if you want to
But when they come through they come through

[Polow]
When they come, better hope it never happens
But when shit gets done, heater holders get to clappin
Your heart, pit-pitty-pattin, see Buddy?  He, he the captain
Safer in this motherfucker, later
But the fucker, Decatur to Da-Da-Dakota
Ski masks and Chevy Novas, we blast from the shoulders
Who's bad?  He got to show us
Shit, lets start talk about it
Toe to toe to Polow?  Hmm, I doubt it
I'm outta site, I'm dynamite, I'ma boom with these raps
And on top of that, I got my hoes 
Jim Crow on this track with P.A.
You don't play, 10 hoes in the back, Attic Crew, say it say it!

When they come through, they come through
When they come through, they come through
When niggas come through they come through
There really ain't nothing you can do
But when they come through they come through

When they come through, they come through
When they come through, they come through
When niggas come through they come through
Be ready if you want to
But when they come through they come through

[Cutty Cartel]
Outside the club, hear my jam in the speaker
Funk like a skunk, cologne, hen dog and reefer
The concrete stomping motherfucking dirt lovers
Heart slayers pimping, but the players good fellows
Lay on your toes, hoes, cause we are mackadocious
We wear out them dogs, when they bite, they ferocious
Take it like a man, sucker, don't go the chump route
Sport your girl like these shoes, toss her when she roll out
Ain't no niggas like the P.A. niggas, Jim Crow
And at the crib we don't stop
They come through!
Doing shows, fucking hoes, making doe, we A-Town thang on lock 
Yeah</pre>
