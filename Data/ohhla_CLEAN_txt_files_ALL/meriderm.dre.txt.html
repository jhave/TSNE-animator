Intro: Jewell

Uh no, ride with me, ooh babe
Uh no, ride with me, oh yeah
So many people wanna ride with me
Bumpin thru the streets gettin high with me
And if you're down to ride with me
Cos you're rollin with the Row

Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg

Creepin down the back street on Deez
I got my Glock cocked cos niggas want these
Now soon as I said it
seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a Tek 9
tryin ta take mine
ya wanna make noise, make noise
I make a phone call my niggas comin like the Gotti boys
bodies bein found on Greenleaf
with their fuckin heads cut off
Motherfucker I'm Dre
so listen to the play-by-play
day-by-day
rollin in my '4 with sixteen switches
And got sounds for the bitches
clockin all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by
Cos I'm too hard to lift
and no this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfuckin D-R-E
from the CPT
on a rhymin spree
a straight G
Hop back as I pop my top ya trip
I let the hollow points commence to
POP POP POP
yeah
cos if it don't stop
I have to put my shit in reverse
go back and take another stop
cos I'm

Rollin down the motherfuckin backstreets
wit my drink and my cup and my strap in my lap, see
Ain't nothin but the G Funk, bumpin in my ????
Hell yeah
[Dre] With all the niggas sayin


Chorus: Jewell

So many people wanna ride with me
Bumpin thru the streets gettin high with me (Hell yeah)
And if you're down to ride with me
Cos you're rollin with the Row!
(with all the niggas sayin)
So many people wanna ride with me
Bumpin thru the streets gettin high with me (Hell yeah)
And if you're down to ride with me
Cos you're rollin with the Row!

Verse 2: Dre, Snoop

Just another motherfuckin day for Dre
so I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists
It's just that gangster glare
with gangsta raps
that gangsta shit
makes a gang of snaps
Uhh, word to the motherfuckin streets
and word to these hyped ass lyrics and dope beats
that I hit ya with
that I get ya with
as I groove in my '4 on Deez
hittin the switches
bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on
bumpin like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
but before I hit the dope spot
I gotta get the chronic, the Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smellin like indo-nesia
bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
Cos my '4 on hit
pancake front and back, side to side
and all that shit
so when I crawl I comes correct
now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
as I dip a nigga trip to the south side
yeah

Right back up in you it's the D-R-E
Witta ounce as we bounce thru the CPT
Diamond in the back, gators on the wheels
This is strictly for my bitches, now we're hittin in switches
Niggas gettin jealous cos hos be on our dick
But Dre don't give a fuck and I don't give a shit
So the '4 won't blow
stoppin by the spot to get some indo
[Dre] With all the motherfuckin bitches sayin

Chorus: Jewell

So many people wanna ride with me
Bumpin thru the streets gettin high with me (Hell yeah)
And if you're down to ride with me
Cos you're rollin with the Row!
(with all the motherfuckin bitches sayin)
So many people wanna ride with me (check this out)
Bumpin thru the streets gettin high with me ( No hell yeah!)
And if you're down to ride with me
Cos you're rollin with the Row!

Verse 3: Dat Nigga Daz

It's like Long Beach, Compton, LA and Wotts
I come thru beatin down your block wit a million-plus watts
I burn double peelout, check it out, it's me now
it's young Daz from the pad, homie, watch me skee'd out
I'm on a mission to mission with tha time for the streets
Me and my homeboys clownin we be bouncin to the beat
I come thru rattlin and shakin plus I break down walls
Me and my doggs ain't breakin no law
Put the ???? in the verse, took a sip for the thirst
Swervin by the curb while blazin the 'erb, nickel bird
She got my sounds, the way I floss throughout the town
Me and my partners from the Row, partners from the Pound
Big Style, Joe Coomey and Snoop, Nate and Kurupt
Tray Deee, Technique, BadAss and Doggystyle
Put it work, day and night, night and day, but any day (hell yeah)
you come around the way you won't live the next day
Check it out!

Chorus: Jewell

So many people wanna ride with me (with everybody sayin)
Bumpin thru the streets gettin high with me 
And if you're down to ride with me (hell yeah)
Cos you're rollin with the Row!
So many people wanna ride with me
(Yeah)
And if you're down to ride with me
Cos you're rollin with the Row! (you wanna ride?)
