[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Ohh! Individuals
Individuals
Individual time!

[Chorus 2X: Drag-On]
This is hood hop, this is not pop
Need to keep your hands up, this is hip-hop
Put your hands up, put your-put your hands up!
Put your hands up, put your-put your hands up!

[Drag-On]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Drag dash, fresh out the kitchen pot
My shotgun pellets look like chicken pox
I'm a Capricorn GOAT mixed with a ox
And my box cutter's not really for a box
Them stains on the ground is too much for a mop
My momma said I'll spend too much for a drop
Cause, that ain't even the whole car
I use block money to buy up the whole bar
And muh'fuckers tryin to get rid of me mayne
My clip still look like Sega Genesis games
I'm in my werewolf SHIT!
Throw me in the woods I'll come back with a bull's head, no bullshit

[Chorus] w/ Swizz ad libs

[Drag-On]
Uh, uh
People sayin "Drag, hurry up and get back"
I eat rappers, drink 'em down with a Swizz track
Niggaz think me and DMX is just actors
Swizz found me in the forest tryin to pull the cactus{?}
My gun clap like...
Put a punk-ass rapper on his back like
I know you hear real rap comin back like
They say he the best? Oh is that right?
Told you I'm a beast, I'm an animal, at night
These rap niggaz keep beefin over cat fights
This is D-R to the A-G to the dash O-N
Still got you open, uhh

[Chorus] w/ Swizz ad libs

[Drag-On]
Uh, uh
I get 'em found, then get 'em lost
I just want his soul, you can keep his corpse
I put it to his mind, now I see his thoughts
You just see a Ferrari, I just see a horse
Blow kush, I'm high as the sky baby
My love's same size as a public library
Yeah my wrist heavy, and my clip's heavy
This is H-dot E-dot, you're so not ready

[Chorus]

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Okay, ohh! Ohh!
Got 'em, SHOWTIME! Ohh!
Bounce, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!</pre>
