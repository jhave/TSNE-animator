Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You are the reason why
Years fly by, and I don't find
The strength I need to grow
I know, I know

Enemies, they stand in line
I'm on my knees, and I can't find
The words I to let you know
I know, I know, I know

You are the reason why
Years fly by, and I don't find
The strength I need to grow
I know, I know

Enemies, they stand in line
I'm on my knees, and I can't find
The words I to let you know
I know, I know, I know

You are the reason why [x8]</pre>
