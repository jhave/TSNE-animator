This is the way we roll

[Verse 1: Elephant Man]
So mi waan everybody to throw dem up (Yep!)

You nuh give a damn about people (Throw dem up)
Yuh mad yuh got di keys to di vehicle (Throw dem up)

Run, wheneva yuh see we come rollin up son
Money true nuff we be foldin up some
Caddilac Jeep lookin stunned, girls wanna have fun step inna di Rolls Royce and dun

Mi seh yuh hear dem waan play dumb, drive out Caddilac inna di neighborhood we nuh play dumb

[Chorus: Elephant Man]
Inna di club sippin Cristal just come off a parole (This is the way we roll)
Inna di Caddy gal a call fi mi daddy tekin out di baggy haggy (This is the way we roll)

Inna yuh a watch di daddy baggy grabby and waan fi blow jolly, a so we roll cold

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Watch it how!!!! The way we rollin I'm sayin
We never fall and I get up all in your soul it's Busta Bus and Ele
So much diamonds it's gettin cold, we no longer be wearin gold
The way we mash it up request it when you want a celly
Come to us step it up in your face
Act it up while you just back it up I fuck up the place
Now listen, the game is to be sold not told
Just incase you might not really know when this is the way we roll

[Chorus: Elephant Man]
Inna di club sippin Cristal just come off a parole (This is the way we roll)
Inna di Caddy gal a call fi mi daddy tekin out di baggy haggy (This is the way we roll)
It nuh funny spend we own a money so we can shout it out loud (This is the way we roll)
Inna yuh a watch di daddy baggy grabby and waan fi blow jolly, a so we roll cold

[Verse 3: Shaggy]
