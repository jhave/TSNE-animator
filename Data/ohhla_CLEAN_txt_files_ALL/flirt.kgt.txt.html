(Oh yeah)
(Flirt) (flirt) (flirt) (flirt) (flirt)...

(Oh yeah)

[ VERSE 1: King Tee ]
Now girlies, ladies, just stay alert
I'm what you call a legitimate flirt
And if you don't know how to spell f-l-i-r-King Tee
The coolest of the cool, there's no one cooler than me
Because I talk to dames with no hesitation
I fill their heads with dreams and fascination
And when it's time for me to break that bone
(Oh yeah) I just wax, then send they ass home (See ya!)
Cause I'm a K-i-n-g, no, a p-i-m-p
I put pretty girls to work
Now if you wanna join my crew
You must listen to what I do
It's real simple, it's slick and real easy
I just (flirt)

(Girls will all wanna try)	--&gt; LL Cool J
(Flirt)

(Oh yeah)

[ VERSE 1: King Tee ]
Now don't get me wrong, I don't think I'm macho
I talk to girls and they get all hot, so
I just let em know that I'm a real cool niggaroe
Not a tramp, just your average gigolo
Close to Casanova, got the knowledge of Farrakhan
Stroll like a pimp or a black Don Juan
I play my role real cool cause I don't wanna scare em
(Oh yeah) I'm recruitin for my King Tee harem
Girls try to front messin with the pooh-put
I just tell em who I am and knock boots, huh
I diss a stunt after smokin a blunt
Catch a real fly girl cause they think I'm a hunk
But I'm a (flirt)

(Thought I was a)	--&gt; Rakim
(Flirt)

(Oh yeah)

[ VERSE 2: King Tee (&amp; DJ Pooh) ]
(Now wait a cotton-pickin second, King Tee)
What's up? (You're not a better flirt than me)
Wha-ha? Who are you? (Pooh, the pimp saga
I take the freak to the Snooty or Ramada
You take girls to a cheap motel)
Sh-shut up (Then run your mouth like Howard Cosell)
No, it's not like that, I'm a romancer
Skeezers like the way I do the cool dances
I got money to spend, I got money to lend
And if the girls don't want it, hell, give it to the men
I ain't a souped up jerk
It's either my way or the highway, the fly way
I'm a (flirt)

(Oh yeah)

(That's right y'all, his name is)	--&gt; Kurtis Blow
(Flirt)

(It can be done but only I can do it)	--&gt;Rakim

(Flirt)

(King Tee is) 	--&gt; King Tee
(one hell of a)	--&gt; Dimples D
(flirt)
