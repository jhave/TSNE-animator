[Hook]
[W.J.] If ya girl read ya two-way pager wanna know "Who's Tanya?"
(Ain't no need to fight tonight)
[C.O.] And my girl called me up said
she saw you at the bar buying drinks for Cassandra
(Ain't no need to fight tonight)
[W.J.] And for the thugs holdin slugs
ain't no need to buss, too many girls screamin "have fun"
(Ain't no need to fight tonight)
Everybody in the club tonight, c'mon
Two wrongs don't make it right, c'mon

[Wyclef]
Excuse me if you see me screamin'
For deep in my mind I'm only dreamin'
Cuz if I wake up and you're not by my side
I feel half of me is no longer alive (say what)

[Claudette]
If only, I give you one last chance (one last chance)
With the devil you can no longer dance (no no no)
You've got to be faithful (faithful)
So we could be fruitful (fruitful)
Cuz all I need is, looove

[J.D.] oh, oh - 'Clef, holla at ya boy

[Hook]

[Wyclef]+(Claudette)
They say two wrongs don't make it right
So if I'm wrong, I ain't tryna fight
I'm tryna have some dinner wit some candlelight
Lay up in the bed and make love all night
So we say, easy mami say, we say EASY mami say, mi say
(Easy papi, say mi say, EASY papi)

[Wyclef]+(J.D.)
Excuse me if you see me screamin'
For deep in my mind I'm only dreamin' (what's he talkin 'bout)
Cuz I've grown from a thug to a man
Build my castle with bricks and no longer with sand girl (ok)

[Claudette]
If only, I give you one last chance (one last chance)
With the devil you can no longer dance (oo-ooh)
You've got to be faithful (faithful)
So we could be fruitful (fruitful)
Cuz all I need is, looove

[Hook]

[Wyclef]+(J.D.)
It's been a while kid, since ya heard 'Clef flow (uh huh)
So here I go, here I go, here I go (alrite)
In the hood you brought me hope so I neva sold coke
The only dope I sell is the track when it smoke *cough* (yea)
Then blow into the skys say L-O-V-E, (uh huh)
Why owe you, when I can give it to you now (yea)
I mean right now, what happened to the ghetto love
Like "someone please call 9-1-1" (ha ha)
If two wrongs to make it right (uh uh)
And if I'm wrong I ain't tryna fight (uh huh)
I'm just tryna rub that cat tonight (that's right)
I believe I believe I believe I'm right

[Hook]

[Wyclef]+(Claudette)
They say two wrongs don't make it right
So if I'm wrong, I ain't tryna fight
I'm tryna have some dinner wit some candlelight
Lay up in the bed and make love all night
So we say, easy mami say, we say EASY mami say, we say
(Easy papi, say mi say, EASY papi)

[Outro]
Wyclef, JD, the world is in trouble
(Ain't no need to fight tonight)
Claudette, the world is in trouble
So So Def, the world is in trouble
(Ain't no need to fight tonight)
Refugee Camp, yo the world is in trouble
Run on the double, the world is in trouble (let's go)
(Ain't no need to fight tonight)
Everybody in the club tonight, c'mon
Two wrongs don't make it right, c'mon

[Wyclef]
Let's go! So So Def, peace! Wit da Refugee Camp
Now when we come through, thugs wanna buss they slugs
Ladies wanna rush us, at da VIP
They love when Atlanta, hooks up with Haiti</pre>
