Typed by: esco108@hotmail.com

This for you ma
I miss you so much

Just being real with it
I love you ma
We celebrating the life of Jana Taylor

I still love you we together

Ma where ya body is not where ya soul is
I understand this concept 100%
So it's a celebration...yes
Don't visit where you lay its not where you rest
You always told me this bodies a shell
We sons and daughters of god there's no heaven or hell
Its misguided energy
Never born never die
But some get led down the wrong path mentally
Too good for the earth
And when I say I love you now just don't know what it's worth
If you ain't here to hear it
I am I being selfish or being fearful
And some days don't even know what I'm here for
Cause all my goals were based around you
Every dream a son dreams for his mom he wants to do
I keep telling myself you're in such a better place
But I'm having a hard time not seeing face to face
First mother's day without you
Woke up feeling doubtful
A lot of hate and pain has been the outcome
It ain't been a year wounds opened far from healed
Starting to feel scars from scabs pealed
It's the worst hand you can be dealt
And if you make it past that shit you gon be felt
Not a day goes by not an hour doesn't ring
Bells and memories of the qualities you bring
You hear with me, beautiful voice I hear like Whitney
I'm on my grind ma till the angels come get me

I still love you we together
Jana Taylor is forever
