[Intro: Chamillionaire]
Chamillionaire's so - crazy
Look at the face of the media like you - crazy
You thought I'd fall, I'm sorry dawg ya - crazy
Mirror mirror on the wall, you are - crazy
I wonder if it's still called memory loss
if you can't remember the last time you lost, ha ha
 
[Chamillionaire]
Yeah, the only time I lose is when it's my memory
Haters comin around here, talkin about "Remember me?"
Nah, amnesia, Cham leader apparently
You are just a follower now I'm about to set a speed
that they can't keep up with, no one ahead of me
Victory is just, what I said that I can achieve
Bout to be trouble, you scared? I think you'd better leave
Hope you don't have asthma, ah-ahm, go 'head and breathe
 
Yeah, pull out your inhaler (go 'head and breathe)
You gon' have to catch your breath for this one
This the victory lap
 
Yeah, garage lift up, it'll create some enemies
Got the S-S in the middle of it like Tennessee
Sorry but the Ferrari there isn't friend-ly
The engine be runnin (PYOON!) like it's {?} keys
If she a freak don't handcuff her, just let her be
Get your G's like five letters after the letter B
Photocopy could possibly find a better me
Hot like two letters after the letter C
In the name of gang that's BEEN runnin the game
Help me explain and tell 'em, Chamillitary mayne
 
[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
I am a hustler, you gotta pay me
No time to sleep, I'm in the streets on the daily
When you a hustler, no bein lazy
I got it whenever you need it just page me
Hustler music, hustler music
Hustler music, I'm hustlin music
You thinkin, you thinkin I'ma lose baby
Either you stupid or you gotta be crazy, crazy
 
[Chamill] Ha ha (Famous) you ready Famous?
[Lil Ken] Hold up, I gotta take these 20 G's and take it to the bank G
[Chamill] Aight fo' sho' I got it
[Lil Ken] Hold up (YEAH!)
 
[Chamillionaire]
The Hype Williams to y'all rookies, you know that this is
a motion picture so SICK that I call it motion sickness
Jonathan Manyon the manuscript, so hold your pictures
Just like you're posin for strippers and tryin to show your riches
Materialistic I got a lot of material
Umm, I got a lot of... uhh, Cham-nesia
I probably break up with my own self and go solo
Versus for promo, oh no
 
[Lil Ken]
I'm a monster, up and cummin like dicks, no homo
A lil' too gangsta for them flicks, no photos
I'm high like gas, rose sticks and blow dodo
Hahaha, that Texas {shit}, fa sho' though
Fresh off the underground circuit
Straight into this overground circus (clown ass)
I'ma do numbers like the lotto
Shoot 'tron straight out the bottle
You not lookin at a role model
So, I say it one time and one time only (say it)
Not your buddy, not your pal or your homie
You know me (ha ha)
 
[Chorus] w/ ad libs
 
[Chamillionaire]
I'm like Bruh Man on the fifth flo'
'Cept I'm comin in through the front do'
I ain't gotta use the window - let's go!
 
Now please pass my passport because I'm it
I got groupies with longer hair than Cousin It
Brazilian ladies who tell me, "This bra just doesn't fit"
Twins in two rooms tryin to make me double dip
Shoulda known I would win, yeah, you thought you had it (what?)
Like my cars and my weapon that is automatic
 
This the part of the horror flick, where the white lady trips and falls
And me and Famous escape with the millions, ha ha
 
[Lil Ken]
Two heavyweights from the Lone Star State
And if 30's the new 20, I been hot since 8
Me flop just wait, not turn blue {nigga}
Tell 'em I'm FAMOUS, thought I was a new {nigga}
Thought you knew {nigga}, when I'm applyin pressure
The brothers play the back lookin like some rhymin extras
Cause I'm the star of the movie, can't move me
Don't try either, either
I'ma roast you then +Bak-er+ like Anita
{Fuck} hot, my records got the fever - stop actin like a diva!
They tellin Cham how they feelin me
I'm a universal asset, your whole team liabilities
So I ain't finna leave, so you ain't finna breathe
Cause I can cut it up or keep it cool like the winter breeze
My piece and chain symbolize respect
My mouthpiece symbolize a check, yup (Chamillitary mayne)
No kids here so how you gon' play me?
Boy tryin to cash out so how you gon' pay me? (hold up)
 
[Chorus]  first 1/2
 
[Chamillionaire]
No time to sleep I gotta keep goin
The hustler of all hustlers, I say it's somethin I borrow
Sell night to the day and then sell today to tomorrow
(No money don't even bother) Got some paper then call up
Call George Bush's daughter I sell her Katrina water (why?)
Just to get at her father, just so they have some evidence
I'm slick enough to take precedence from the president
America's worst nightmare is right here
I stay sizzlin like flares, look up, PYOON!
It's quite clear it's my year 'til I hear
Somebody's smoother then I'm the ruler, I'm like - where
is he at? Just let me know, I'ma bury him
under the rocks in the bottom of my aquarium
The chances of me losin this time are very slim
If he was bright then I'm turnin him down to very dim
If it ain't me in the sequel then there will be no sequel
You know the obvious reason is cause there is no equal</pre>
