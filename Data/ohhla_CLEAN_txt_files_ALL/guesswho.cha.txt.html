[Break - Bun B Sample - 4X]
No, no other bullet duck or get shoved 
Inside this game they better buck us 
Cause the cluckers they love us

No, no
No, no
No, no
Other, no, no, no
Other, no

[Break - Bun B Sample - 2X]
No, no other bullet duck or get shoved 
Inside this game they better buck us 
Cause the cluckers they love us

(*female voice harmonizing*)

[Chamillionaire]
Chamillitary mayne

[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
No need to worry, I already got my "Revenge"
Now that it's after the win, my platinum plaques are my friends (revenge, revenge ...)
You know who's back to bootleggin again
But I got paper to spend, so that's gonna come to a end (woo! woo! ...)
I'ma gonna show 'em how to attack with a pen
I'll get my victory win, I show it happened again
Because I'm back 
Yes (hold up, hold up) (*woman's voice screaming*)
That's right I'm back
(Chamillitary mayne)
It's the Mixtape Mivasa (he's back!)
(Cheah), Chamillitary mayne

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Yeah, and I went from platinum out rap 'em
Yeah they thought that that couldn't happen
On the way to the bank, yeah I'm laughin
See the hook's gonna hook 'em like grapplin
Many folks try to dap 'em, but Koopa got what ya lackin
When I come back I'm attackin, that means your future will blacken
Rap is conceited, but Ken is the only famous to us
Better put it in your face, so you taste the "Flavor of Love"
Rappers cartoons trust me, these dudes ain't slangin them dubs
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
You got Viagra for bullets, act like your anxious to butt
But you ain't gangsta enough, respect my paper I'm tellin ya
Pockets green as a vegetable, wallet sure lookin edible
Put a 1 then a 0 comma 0, a 0 with no decimal
Throw 'bout 4 more 0's, then you know my dough is incredible (yeah)
You might think your the greatest rapper of all-time
But I just think your the greatest rapper in your mind
(No, no, no, no, no, no, other, no, no, no, no, other)
Especially cause your time, don't look like it's on grind
Your music is guarded like Muslims do to a pork rind
Maybe it's cause I think too much, but each decision's the sure kind
If I think that I hurt you, you'll be the one with the sore mind
I schedule a beat down and adjust it to your time
Tonight, like the first words on Jay Leno's door sign (haha)
My accountant says that my paper's as huge as a mountain (*cash register sounds*)
The bank tells me this how my deposits usually soundin
(No, no, no, no, no, no, other, no, no, no, no, other)
Company that was bootleggin me, says they movin my thousands
That's as false as 50 executive producing my album (oh)
That's as false as magazine writers that said that I fall (uh huh)
That's as false as me beefin with Slim or Trae, they my dogs (dogs)
That's as false as me still havin a problem with Paul (naw)
I'm a problem, but the other problem that I have is y'all
I'ma let y'all talk while I aim at the industry and bang it
But this ain't no "True Hollywood" or no "E! Entertainment"
(No, no, no, no, no, no, other, no, no, no, no, other, no)
A, B, C, D, take out the A and the name is
The name of the boot L-E-Ggers, they wanna be nameless
I'm the king of the mixtape scene, so they call me your Highness
Why you think that they call me that? My debut was the highest
of hot, hot enough to light up the sky, so get used to the lighters
Spread like wildfires so you should get used to the fires
They some liars (liars) told me that Chamillionaire will be goneee
But it's obvious that the reaper didn't write it in stone
(No, no, no, no, no, no, other, no, no, no, no, other, no)
Resurrected, then I guess that they couldn't bury his bones (my bones)
I'ma stay on point like eyes starin at the top of a cone

[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
No need to worry, I already got my "Revenge"
Now that it's after the win, my platinum plaques are my friends (cheah)
You know who's back to bootleggin again
But I got paper to spend, so that's gonna come to a end
I'ma gonna show 'em how to attack with a pen 
I'll get my victory win, I show it happened again
Because I'm back (haha, I'm back)
That's right I'm back (cheah)
(Chamillitary mayne) (*sounds of fireworks*)
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? 
He's back! (Murderers)

[Outro - Chamillionaire - talking]
Came a long way since all the awards and all the plaques
But I had to come back
This time it ain't about a stack, it's about facts
Know what I'm talkin about?
Mixtape Messiah Part 2, I know y'all been waitin
I know a lot of y'all been hatin
But it's all good
(No, no, no, no, no, no, other, no, no, no, no, other, no)
I came a long way since them old Swishahouse freestyles
And when I go, you can believe I'ma be a legend
and you can bet that
