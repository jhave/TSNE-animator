[Mad Child]
Experiment with mind control, crowd convulses
We don't act on false impulses
Discipline with fierce conflicts of interest
Different opinions, but damned if we relinquish
Intentional exuberance, tolerate the turbulance
We attract the mentally disturbed and suburban kids
Peculiar forces, no time to take a breather
Talking cockyness, rocking with these awkward overachievers
Vicious sense of humour turn you into a believer
Either dig it or you don't, we won't settle for less
You should hate us with a passion or love us to death
The feeling of enchantment, this blissful rapture
Hits home for some, for others it's hard to capture
Adapt to interference with a sinister appearance
Get devoured by a powerhouse of perceverance

[Prevail]
The main concept to mochary is simple in its motives
You move when it moves, you plan out its orbits
The consequence to that, its heavy in its taxness
It spins your body around with units made for blasting
The thrashing of nationties on action filled streets
The more I stress it the less I feel complete
The heels of my feet are burnt up from walking
Up and down the pavement yelling slave auction
I don't praise those options, I'm not that innocent
I raise my opinions through the nemesis dominion
They ration the supplies through the big brother of this brave new world
Catching rye with the Lord of the Flies
The presentation of demise printed in thirty dialects
I'm early to rise, the connections of the monument
