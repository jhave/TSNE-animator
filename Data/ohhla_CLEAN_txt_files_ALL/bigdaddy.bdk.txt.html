Ahh yeah
We gon' pump this up one time
As we set it off a little like this, kick it!
Pump it up now (it's a Big Daddy thing)
As we send this out to New York City
Can't forget the posse down in Philly
Also in Detroit (it's a Big Daddy thing)
Chicago, Atlanta GA
Sendin this out to Miami (it's a Big Daddy thing)
Tampa, can't forget Virginia and North Carolina
L.A. and Oakland (it's a Big Daddy thing)
And the rest of the world as we go a little somethin like this
(it's a Big Daddy thing)

Let it rain let it rain to be put it pain
with nothin to gain under the wrath of Kane
Cause you can't maintain, I drained every brain
to leave a stain plain to remain in my lane
or path or road, until the next one be sewed
That the B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y explode
Just like a bomb in Vietnam, so hit the alarm
or be funky like a underarm
And allow, me to show how, the microphone should flow
Now, competition bow, to me like a Buddha
The teacher, the tutor
They come a dime a dozen but the Kane look cuter
And I ain't about that slouchin or crabbin
so save it -- cause that's one thing I ain't havin
Because the purpose I serve is to please ya
Rhymes will ease ya, like Milk of Magnesia
So bust a pimp without a limp
And I crush any wimp that would try to attempt to umm
get loose I put a boost and used to chill
the comp to Kane, I picked Beetlejuice

"Big Daddy thing" (2X)

I'm just that ruthless, to leave ya toothless
Cause you're useless, makin up excuses excuses
So never touch tap tangle or tamper
A fearless fly foe'll get slapped with a Pamper
Cause I can dig in your face like root canal
But I'ma chill, won't even dispute you now
Actin wild just ain't my style
Cause only the live will be movin the crowd but see
quiet as kept, not like a starter you
but I can roast an MC like a barbecue
In the Dead Zone, you shouldn't have left home
Steppin to the man, now get the head flown
I bring the terror, horror, there's no tomorrow
Child you shouldn't even bother
to press up, and get broken like a Lee nail
So let me school ya plus scoop your female
Just like a jiggalo but I'm much bigger though
I'm like a hitman, pullin the trigger slow
and smooth to the groove with lyrics that sooth
and improve with every move, that's why you've
been enhanced by the mentally divine
So play football, and let's go the nine
Shorts I take none, cause I ain't the one
In eighty-nine there's damage bein done
And for you to diss me, will be very risky
Cause I make this be, as strong as whiskey
To break and make my foes dispose in force
So y'all can see how me the Kane will just reign
superior, cause I ain't even hearin ya
Save the yang, cause it's a Big Daddy thang

"Big Daddy thing" (4X, then cut and scratched to end)

And this one here goes out to my man Mad Money Murph
Can't forget Big Sha, Big Therm
And also I got to say whassup to my man Horace
Got Nice and Smooth in the place to be
Mack Daddy Nick, know what I'm sayin?
Can't forget my man Ant Live
And of course the one and only Prince Paul, peace!</pre>
