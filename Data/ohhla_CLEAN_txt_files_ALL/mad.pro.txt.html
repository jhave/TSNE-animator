[Intro: Proof]
Drug nation, we know no denial
We are fuckin drug addicts, ha ha!
Don'tcha?  Yes!  Don'tcha?  Yes!
Don'tcha?  Gotta do it - Kurt Cobain!

[Proof]
Sex, drugs, rock'n'roll
Gave a little X, and I got some stroll
Can't tell I lit this roach it's too hot to hold
Turn that up, that's the Countin' Crows
Hy-dro, let's abuse it
Oh, no, that's techno music
Homos and sex abusers
Slow mo', hit the exit duty
A pill, bitch, and a room
Condom biz, takes balloons
Ass, tits, acid
Pass it (that's it!)
Puff, puff, and pass
(Puff, puff, and pass!)
The motherfuckin blunt that's stuffed with hash
Don't make me have to punch yo' ass

[Chorus: Proof] + (Rude Jude)
Mom and Dad! (I smoke weed)
Mom and Dad! (I do blow)
Mom and Dad! (I take E)
Mom and Dad! (I bang hoes)
Oh Mom and Dad! (I sniff paint)
I've been bad! (I drink 'gnac)
Don't be mad please! (I jerk off)
Mom and Dad! (I smoke crack)

[Proof]
My mind ain't where I left it last
I got an F in class; in fact, eff this class!
Why they call this a special class?
I'm gon' press an ass, not test to pass
I do what I want, I'm tired of bein bored
Pass the Corona and turn on some porn
Hand me an ambi' and I start snorin
And don't say it's too early in the mornin!
I'm horn dog but bad to the bone
Slick talkin teacher give me ass, I'm alone
Here, take these pills and pass 'em along
I don't wanna die in my casket alone
If I'm a gat in a room with a hand full of 'shrooms
Morpheus, I took the red and the blue
(Don't do drugs) No more
(Don't do drugs) No less
(Don't do drugs) Without me
(Don't do drugs!) {*coughing*}
That's Kid Rock's advice, Tupac alike
With a pregnant nun, dick slobbin dyke
(Aw come on Proof, man that ain't right!)
Man fuck you Salam, it's hip-hop for life
I'm a cutthroat killa with a butter knife
Man I got the dick that your mother likes

[Chorus]

[Outro: Rude Jude]
Aiyyo Mom and Dad
Thanks a million for raising me bang up job Dad
You left when I was 5 dickhead!
Yo, I got a secret for you Mom
I don't even like going to those family reunions
I just go there to bang my cousins
That's it, you think I like playing volleyball?
I'm lookin at their asses Ma
I'm tryin to knock up one of my cousins Mom
Yo Pop, I think you're a fuckin homo
Hey thanks for payin for my college, I'm learnin a lot
I'm learnin a million, I'm learnin a bunch of shit
Like how to put rufees in chicks drinks and fuck 'em in the face
Look for me at teabag.com bitch
Thanks Mom, thanks Dad you're great
Hey Proof, thanks for gettin me on the fuckin record
Pssh, college, I never been to college
Community college what?
I gotta say somethin else, what?
Fuck it, I'm done...</pre>
