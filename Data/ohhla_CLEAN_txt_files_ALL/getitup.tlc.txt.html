Hey ha ha
There it goes
Yeah
Cuz we's abouts to flow
There it is
For the fellas
There it is
That's it
That's right
There it is
For the fellas
Comin' back on the sexy tip
Ya know what I'm sayin'
But no more dresses for y'all
No more dresses
My brother (brother)
Get it up
Get it up
TLC is back on the mic
Ya know
Ha ha
Get it up
Woo wee
Get it up
Get ready for a real good time
I'm gonna try to blow your mind
Can't you see
You and me
It sounds so nasty
Get it up
Let your thang hang down
We could fool around
Don't you know
I want you so (yeah)
Make me happy (oh)

[Chorus]
Get it up
Get get get get get
Get it up
Get it up (yeah)

There is nothing wrong
With freakin' all night long
Me and you
We're need to groove
It feels good doin' it
Get it up
Leave your cares behind (just leave your cares behind)
Let me try to find
Find a spot (a spot)
To get you hot (ha ha)
Let me do you
Ohhhhh

[Chorus]

One time huh (ha ha ha)
Woo there it is (uh)
There it is
Y'all know what it's like
Y'all know what I'm talkin' about too (ahh)
I know y'all done did that nasty

Yo
And the Left is thinkin' about it
Just to think about it
Leaves your knees in tension
Easin' the tension loosen up enough to clenchin'
Whatever's mentioned (mentioned)
Not to mention what I hand you wit' in question
And a question at hand (there it is)
Are you ready to make me feel the definition of a man (man)
Man is it hot or is it me
Me I guess 'cause when it comes to feelin' free
You free villains on civility my sexuality
A formality of reality
So don't touch me in the morning and walk away (walk away)
As I commence to yawnin' commence to stay (come on)
Stay up for the rest of the day (day)
Just enough for my tongue to play (play)
Play me back back and forth (hey)
Like a kiss (come on)
As I go a little somethin' like this
Oh uh oh oh
Oh oh
You make me wanna sing
Uh uh oh oh
Ohhhhhhh
Uh oh oh
Oh oh
Get me get me up (yeah hey yeah)
Uh uh oh oh
Oh oh
I wanna love you baby
Wanna love you baby
I wanna love you baby
Wanna love you baby
Get it up
Get it up
I'll freak you all night
Get it up
Get it up
I'll freak you all night
Get it up
Get it up
I'll freak you all night
Get it up
Get it up
I'll freak you all night
But no mo dresses for y'all
No mo dresses my brother
You got to get down if you wanna be our baby baby baby
That's what I'm talkin' about
Know what I'm sayin'
Baby baby baby
They got to be some fish out the ocean</pre>
