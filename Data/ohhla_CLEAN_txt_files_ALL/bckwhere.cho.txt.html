[Intro]
{*"You don't have to worry 'cuz I'm comin'..."*}
Yeah! I see your hammer, see your car, see you Mr. Norm
{*"Back to where I should have always stayed..."*}
I see your circle, see your figures, see you're paranorm'
{*"You don't have to worry 'cuz I'm comin'..."*}
Eastside, Westside
{*"Back to where I should have always stayed..."*}
Eastcoast, Westcoast (yeah, Tom Mason!)
North, South (PD!)

[Verse 1]
You see, I'm grown up now
I got new thoughts
New parkin' lot, pennies in the shoe box
I got bank accounts
Things that I own up
A nice guy, but dont cross me for no push ova'
Remember high school days, winters was colda'
Rhyming at the bus stop to keep your hands warma' (hands warma')
The days seemed a little longa'
Back - when I had a fatha'
But - now why botha'?
I - I grew stronga' (what what? yeah...)
A little longer to a performa'
I said I grew stronga'
YO! (yo... c'mon.. yeah)
{*"Back to where I should have always stayed..."*}
I'll take you back into my teenage years
See, I did a little dirt
Don't talk much about it
But I was good at it, the cops had never heard about it
I had a few friends who broke up over ends
Man it's funny how that shit just stays a trend
But in the end
I wish 'em all of the best
And all the success
No time to give myself stress
My kitchen now only 1 chef
Left virgin, greenhouse, new success
So, don't stress, mess test us
Just leave, train, plane, car, bus
Circles still reign victorious
So when people try to bring me 'round all drama
I - dip and handle just a bit of the scandle
Then I bounce to the bahamas
Two first class seats, me and hot mama
2 weeks then, back to greenhouse headquarters
More albums on orda'
More hard drives on orda'..
{*"Back to where I should have always stayed..."*}
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Hook]
{*"You don't have to worry 'cuz I'm comin'..."*}
Yeah! I see your hammer, see your car, see you Mr. Norm
{*"Back to where I should have always stayed..."*}
I see your circle, see your figures, see you're paranorm'
{*"You don't have to worry 'cuz I'm comin'..."*}
Eastside, Westside
{*"Back to where I should have always stayed..."*}

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Slim fast be the size
Spec-tacs' on the eyes
Size 13 feet with the hooks
That got Marlin shook
I took that from an old notebook
My Principle grabbed at the Pope John Paul Cath
I struggled with no cash
No Bel-Air Prince
Just my niggaz gettin' fingerprints on the wall, on the clip
Yeah, I got your letter hommie and I did what you told me
No father to scold me, my brother only
Missed him for 6 years, so I'm raised by his peers
But I love my mama dear, so I chose a career
Now I travel often, condo, valet parkin'
I leave history when I'm in the coffin
Toronto I'll be laid so - y'all spread my name
I'm like 21 when I entered the game
7 years lata', now the weight is much greata'
Raise up the greenhouse antenna
Not just the weight now, but the pockets less thinna'
Got the whole circle with us
We monster trucks to you small fucks
We crush y'all chassis, for just bein' sassy (oh!)
Nigga its I, Choclair (Choclair, Choclair, Choclair nigga)
