This a wake up

[ VERSE 1: Scarface ]
Ain't nothing like the Sunnyside sunshine (sunshine)
Hitting corners ducking one-time
In my platinum color four dog
Tinted out roll rolls (yea I roll, roll)
I hit the beach and I say tops down
Girls with they tops down (whistle)
They got bikinis and they thongs on
Dancing to the thong song (thong song)

[ CHORUS: Tanya Herron ]
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you

[ VERSE 2: Scarface ]
I see that lately that my loves on
Stop at Papa Joes and get my grub on
I ran into my old fling Tasha
Still looking cute but she was knocked up (knocked up)
I'm like ay how you been girl
I see you finna have a kid girl
The funny thing about Tasha (what's that)
Is that she was destined to be knocked up (knocked up)
She twenty-nine and still a cold freak
But she got a baby in the car seat
She wanted to be seen in all the funk spots
Still getting crunk staying drunk huh (drunk huh)
The Friday nights are still the same things
Looking for diamonds and the chrome things (bling, bling)
I'm sitting in my Benz in a nice spot
I bet you want to be my wife huh

[ CHORUS: Tanya Herron ]
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you

[ VERSE 3: Scarface ]
And I been lonely for a long time
That's why I'm glad the baby ain't mine
Ran up to the door but left my car keys
I went back in the store and I saw Daffany
Lookin like she did back in eighth grade (eighth grade)
Just like she did back in eighth grade
We used to skip school and do the wild thang
And I'm like daffany was up man
I just got out law school
She said attorney for the criminals
I'm making six figures every six months
She said she had everything a bitch want
And been lookin for a nigga for her whole life (whole life)
Don't you want to make me your wife? (Uh, uh)
I guess my answer must have stunned her
(I don't think so)
I guess I must have stunned her

[ CHORUS: Tanya Herron ]
Bye, bye baby
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you

I guess I didn't know, I guess I didn't know

I'm calling; I'm calling not anybody just you now baby

Keep your eyes on me baby</pre>
