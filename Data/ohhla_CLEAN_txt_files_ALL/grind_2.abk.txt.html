Song:   Grind 2 the Flow
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yo, I'ma a little hipper than the average hop
I'm the type of motherfucker you can't stop
Especially those that make me mad
Cause I can be the worse enemy that you ever had
So if you knew me then, then you know me now
And for all the virgin ears, I'm so glad to bust you out
I be all in your face but hard to find
Underground living so this killer can hustle and grind

[Chorus]
The life that you live, is it real or are you fakin?
Those rules you make, are they from your heart or were you persuaded ?
So I'ma grind 2 the flow, grind 2 the flow, grind 2 the flow
So I'ma grind 2 the flow, grind 2 the flow, grind 2 the flow

You know, every time I spit it people get it because we connected
And every time we get together we wreck shit
I pay dues to make moves just like the next man
Soul of a warrior, come and catch me if you can
Some of ya'll recognize real shit
While other are influenced and just take it like a bitch
So if you real with the words that you spill
There ain't no reason you should feel anything you do is ill

[Chorus]

I got some courage in the heavy hitting heart beat
I got the attitude to survive in the streets
I got the wisdom of an old school cat
With my mind set on one thing, taken it back
I got the nerve to go do whatever
Cause there really ain't too many out here doing it better
So when you see me keep one thing in mind
That this motherfucking killer is always on his grind

[Chorus x2]</pre>
