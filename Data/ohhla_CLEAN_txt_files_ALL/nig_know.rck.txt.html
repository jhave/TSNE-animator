Song:   Niggaz Know
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Woo!  Yeah, uh-huh
Uhh, turn it up, turn it up baby
Brand new, world premier
Pete Rock, ahh, Dilla Dawg
Jay Dee, yeah
Bring your crew dawgs

[J-Dilla]
I got a crew we call K-boys - why?  Cause we like to get dough
The seaside boy be in the bar watchin hoes get low
Dilla Dawg and Pe-ter, skeet skeet
Spit shit on the track like Dog in _Beat Street_
When y'all need heat, just check the credits
Cause Pay J, gon' send a check next day FedEx
Yes J said it nigga, beats for trucks
Goin up in four months, need at least a buck
The way I rock ice you would think my name was Peter
Bitches tongues out like back in the day in the theatres (woo!)
And the heaters is kept where they supposed ta
Smoke ya like the welcome poster
And Dilla got killers that'll gat your boy like Reese's pop
Keep knots like a crumb snatcher boy
When these two niggaz collab', these niggaz collapse
Cause see it gets no hotter, holla at'cha boy

[Chorus: Pete Rock]
Yeah, I spit fire at that ass
Many often wonder will hip-hop still last
Cause I'm the one they call the Boy Wonder
Fuckin with J-Dilla, rappin niggaz, know how I feel-a

[Pete Rock]
Yo, this is not child's play
Similar to a gat when my mind spray
I spit rhymes like a pro son, rappin shogun
I lunge at you niggaz with a bolo punch
It's the, Boy Wonder at the cruise control
Are you really ready for some super dynamite SOUL
Relax, let me spark the L
And leave smoke on the track as the tires peel
When I rock what's real niggaz appeal to that
13 in the game, makin classic rap
And stay elusive, a lot of y'all fake-ass niggaz
wish you can do this, passion from the heart makes you true in this
Music, #1 sound, overground
Make haste on the freeway like the Greyhound
And avoid these clowns and let real niggaz know
Pete Rock blast off in 2004, uhh

[Chorus] - repeat 2X
