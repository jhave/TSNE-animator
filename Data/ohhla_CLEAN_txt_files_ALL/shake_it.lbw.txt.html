Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ah hah hah (show time)
Shake it two time
Shake it one time, shake it two time
Shake it one time, shake it two time
Shake it one, two two, one one two two two
One time, shake it two time
Shake it one time, shake it two time (ladies)
Shake it one time, shake it two time
Shake it one time

Let's shake it one time baby, your two times baby
I'm Bow Wow, you know how I do now baby
A new style, and I got a new sound baby
In my wrist, ear, neck, bling, {plow} (hah)
Easy on 'em, they sayin' be easy on 'em
I'm sayin' be Weezy, don't be playin'
I'm too freezy on 'em, I'm frozen
'Cause VBs on 'em, float with the TV on 'em
Floatin' the GT on 'em, floatin' like Jesus on 'em
They gonna go on and more on much murder
You can't resuscitate him
Who's fatal for hate forsaken, I keep the ladies waitin'
I keep the ladies paintin' and drippin' and change 'em
When I'm trippin', grippin' the grain and
Switchin' up lanes I make 'em shake it

One time, shake it two time
Shake it one time, shake it two time
Shake it one time, shake it two time
Shake it one, two two, one one two two two
One time, shake it two time
Shake it one time, shake it two time (ladies)
Shake it one time, shake it two time
Shake it one time

Shake it for me momma all around like you never shake
Shake it for me momma off the ground, make you levitate
I get you so wet bet you I make your levy break
(Drop it, dr-drop it, dr-drop it)
Yeah 'cause I'm a heavy weight
Flyin' up to levitate baby so I don't ever hate
I pop it off in there, stay baby so I don't ever wait
Money's not a problem Lil' Mama but I don't ever pay
Just wrap it up and shake your body like a Chevrolet
Impala, and you can smell the polish
The whip be stylin' like I took it to the beauty parlor
You know how we be right, this time I brought my partner
They call me Lamborghini Moss, swizz the monster

I say one time, shake it two time
Shake it one time, shake it two time
Shake it one time, shake it two time
Shake it one, two two, one one two two two
One time, shake it two time
Shake it one time, shake it two time (ladies)
Shake it one time, shake it two time
Shake it one

If you got your head done shake it one time (hey)
If you got your nails done shake it two time (hey)
If you keep your feet done shake it three times (hey)
If you don't need a man shake it mo' times
If you got your head done shake it one time (one time)
If you got your nails done shake it two times (two times)
If you keep your feet done shake it three times
If you don't need a man shake it mo' times

One time, shake it two time
Shake it one time, shake it two time
Shake it one time, shake it two time
Shake it one, two two, one one two two two (yeah)
One time, shake it two time
Shake it one time, shake it two time (ladies)
Shake it one time, shake it two time
Shake it one time

(Drop it, dr-drop it, drop it, dr-drop it)
Swiss, now bring it back like...</pre>
