Whassup man?
I think you need to back up off me brah
Cause right now, I'm not feelin too good
And I have a attitude problem
You might push that button to strike that nerve
So you need to just go 'head on and back up

[Master P]
WHICH ONE OF YOU WENCHES SCRATCHED MY 600??!

Y'all don't wanna step to dis, hah, whut? (repeat 4X)

[Master P]
I used to check domes, now it's platinum over chrome
Surveillance in my home, but they still tappin my phone
See I'm the thug of the century
Cause I done laid it down
from the streets to overseas to penitentiary
We got beef, diss 3rd Ward and get the soldiers
I represent the 3rd Ward Callio' I thought I told ya
See the eyes of the tiger in my blood
Ask TLC, am I a motherfuckin scrub?
We attack from the back whether it's a Jag or some cat
I'm all about my scratch -- you get that? (hahah)
See nuttin don't last forever
but Only God Can Judge Me, cause I'm down to do whatever

Y'all don't wanna step to dis, hah, whut? (repeat 4X)

[Master P]
Soldiers make some noise (HOODY HOO) whassup, where you at?
All my thugs in the front and all my thugs in the back
See I'm a soldier for life and that's real I keep it trill
Body full of tattoos and a motherfuckin gold grill
I like my Henn and my trees cause I'm a baller
Can I really hoop?  Fool, ask Vince Carter
Six million on top, now y'all suckers pop
When I close down shop, don't make me get the glock
From the South to the East, give it up
And from the West to the North we bout to tear the fuckin club up
(UNNNNNNNNGGGH) Lotta players wanna serve me
Cause I'm the ghetto Bill Gates but I'm legit, ya heard me??

Y'all don't wanna step to dis, hah, whut? (repeat 4X)

[D.I.G.]
Here come dem boys out the bricks, a-lil-daddy whassup
You say you bout trigger play, now show me that you a thug
I ain't wit that mouthin off, I'm out spillin your blood
Mess around if you wanna box, gon' stay in the mud
No Limit soldiers known for bustin it up
Better tell him it's real, we be tossin it up
So if you step to these soldiers I think you better show some love
Cause we 99 strong, and we nuttin but thugs
and pistols bein cocked at all times
and when you run up you gon' fall down
Cause I'ma hit you with the heat and make you calm down
You ain't ready to go to war with a real soldier
So don't step to me fool, cause the game is over

Y'all don't wanna step to dis, hah, whut? (repeat 8X)</pre>
