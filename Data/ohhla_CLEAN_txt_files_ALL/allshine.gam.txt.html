[Childish Gambino]
Yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah...
Yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah...
What the fuck do y'all niggaz really want? I went with realness instead
But all the real niggaz I know either crazy or dead
Yeah I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot
You niggaz keep askin on whether this dude's f'real or not
I'm not tryin to come hard, I'm tryin to come me
That's why these older songs that I used to make I'd release free
What's the point of rap if you can't be yourself, huh?
That's why I come first like my cell phone
I'm a role model; I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it's dumb, that's the fuckin reason I'm doin it
So why does everyone have a problem with talkin stupid shit?
Or is it real shit? Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend's baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
See, that's not even right
You with a different girl like each and every fuckin night
and kiss her while she's sleepin and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That's not life, dude
It's just makin up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
Cause I ain't Mumford, I ain't tryin' to have sons
All I wanted was some more like Ashton
I ain't the coolest but I know I got passion - I got passion!1

[Chorus]
I really wanna do right - and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine, we need to find
I really wanna do right - and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine, we need to find
"Baby, I'm okay" She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
I said, "Baby, I'm okay" She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
I said, "Baby, I'm okay" She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
"Baby, I'm okay" She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"

[Childish Gambino]
Am I serious? I don't even know
Are you hearin this? This shit is laughable
I ain't tryin I'm doin, these other rappers are foolish
I got fame, my A&amp;R's a computer
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes?
Who wears short-shorts and makes jokes sometimes?
My nigga like, "I'd get you MTV if I could, man.
But Pitchfork only likes rappers who crazy or hood, man"
So, I guess we gon' see, I ain't Curren$y
But if there ain't money in my name please murder me
Sometimes I feel like I ain't supposed to be here
Sometimes I wake up and I don't want to be here
My mom loved to text me Psalm verses
She don't look at me like I'm the same person
I used to be the sweet one, but things change
and I don't want them missin a son like Bone's last name
And all my uncles alcoholics, shame on me
I drink whiskey 'til I'm grounded, no TV
I wanna go inside the club with, no gold piece
And walk in with No I.D. and no ID
No matter how far the hood seems, we all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be

[Outro]
I really wanna do right - and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine, we need to find
I really wanna do right - and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine, we need to find
I really wanna do right - and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine, we need to find
I really wanna do right - and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine, we need to find
We need to find... ohhh, we need to find</pre>
