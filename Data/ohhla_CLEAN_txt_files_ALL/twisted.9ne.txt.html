Verse 1:
I gets
More trips than a
Little bit
I smoked
More dips than a
Little bit
I'm not that regular
When stepping
I can't wait
Till i can fly
Away from
My competitor
Yeah Santana
Can die
My psychosis
Hopeless
Focus
Notice
My metamorphosis
Folks is
Broke and jokeless
Picture me in a syringe
Inserted
In an over exerted
Felon
Antidote having 'em running
Eternally
Across the helland
Dwamn
Losing my sanity
Living up in
Les miserables
Fuck bitter broads
This shit is gonna have us stacking
If there is a God
Imma take the
X away from generation
Place it at
The end of S.E.
For the duration
Upon the level
Tell the devil to what
Skip a human
Imma tell him
Behold pale horses
Like us
Shame on a nigga
When he's feeling
Hella down
for a ninety-nine killing
Ain't giving a
Fuck I'm putting Nair
In your leave in hair conditioner
Now you Hari Krishna
To my listeners
In this rhyme
You will find
Psychotic scriptures
Saying it's something
Disrupting my mind

(Hook 1)
TECH N9NE
Your mind is fine
There's just not anyone
Like you
The whole wide world
Don't matter
No
They can't flow
Like you
Understand

(Hook 2)
My thoughts are twisted
So mixed up
(repeat x 4)

Verse 2:
A
I'm lifted
B
I'm twisted
C
I'm sick and sadistic
A,B, and C
Something's I do
I just can't stand
Up in my bathroom
I sex
Six women
Mentally
Just me and me
Me and my faithful
Right hand man
Tie up a Muslim
And shoot him with liquid pork
On Ramadan
With force
I'll make a Christian
Read their kids
The necronomicon
On Christmas
Don't trip on this lyrical syphilis
I flip this
So the yonks will catch vapors
Like menthalyptus
I'll feed a dominatrix patient
Pain pills
Give Wu haters permanent
Fang grills
Trick the artist formerly known
And give him
The same slave deal
I'll lift a couple of
Dr. Dre's reels
Sell 'e to Snoop
And No Limit Soldiers
Just so i can see
How paid feels
Hazy Shade
Of decade
Hookers with grave shields
Where AIDS fills
The carcass
Bet a milli on it
Techa N9na be the darkest
Heartless
I spark from the gut
So what the fuck
I'm trying to contain
The insane
But what

(Hook 2)

Verse 3:
Welcome to my
Asylum
It's hectic
They call me dyslexic
Rogue infested
More vicious than Cujo
Fraudulent tested
The punks arrested
Got the neck slit
Exit
I'm twisted
I know Hollywood backwards
Says doowylloh
Force feed me a
Sumo
For about nine weeks
Playing Club
Nuevo
Till he's blue
Though
Then stuff him in the front seat of a
Yugo
Body filled with beef and toaster
Strudel
Let up the break
And watch him race
To the intersection
Now he's through
Though
Yastuvo
I slide with a gang
Of twisted individuals
Somebody better be
Looking for the criminal tendencies
Never will they get us
In the penitentiaries
Killa
Millimeter N9ne rips vinyl
I know
Mix flow like Korean Albino
Wino
Once breeded an elephant
With a rhino
Called it the hell if I know
Throw Chuck Manson
Off in a pit
Of militant Jews
Banging hella opera
The real meaning
Of helter skelter
Is when they skin that
Forehead swastika
Am I twisted
Am I twisted
I'm twisted
Better keep your distance
Mama gotta call the Psychiatrics
For mental assistance
(Hook 1)
