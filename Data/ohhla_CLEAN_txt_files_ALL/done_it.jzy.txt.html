[Verse 1]
Guess whos back in da building, mind on a million it's some bitch from decater
She be holding my cash and I be holding her down
she be holding my work and I be dicking he down
just got a call from the other side of town

said I hope you aint the feds nigga ima do me
said he comin rite back

one nigga ooh wee, 17, 5, yea you know shawty low
anythang bout to blow bitch ask shawty

now I'm black tee wearing hell naw I aint caring
and I'll wreck this bitch and come back in a maclarin
you know da feds stareing, and I aint even caring
I left my 87's off nigga show them wat I'm wearing.

[Chorus]
I done done it all lexis, ice strokes, chevys, bitches, promices broken.
You aint never in your life seen a nigga this focused
and done done it all in a pair of air forces [2x]

[Verse 2]
If it's a UFO then it's the FBI and one more u

talkin about the whole, and you don't even know but half
I'm talkin lumpkin, dumpkin, macnabb, yea my partner got arrested I got a new lexis
and yea I told my girl lexis to buy a new lexis.

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3]
A real nigga on top yall should be glad to see let me ask yall a question
and don't you laugh at me, come things first but I don't knoe why
take them out the cage and they still wont fly
take them out the flap and they still wont sell
take them out ten times and they still wont smell
you can get a good lawyer but he still gone tell
and you can fix a car and it's still gone fail
I done did some buisness with mariah, lupee, usher
same ol j.young aint no buster, never said I was a usher
so how you gone act like I aint no hustler
I got bitches all round me young like usher
don't leave your bitch around me young might fuck her
catch me in the ballout, me and my shooters
in a white drop top, hooters, broad day big bag, getting money, 5 grand we had...
rent money, real nigga till I die, get money, 20 in advance big money

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
