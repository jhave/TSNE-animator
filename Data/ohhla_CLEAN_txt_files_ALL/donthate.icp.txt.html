I gotta tell him..
I gotta be a man and handle my business..
I know he's gonna hate me..
Ahhh I gotta call him

What up dogg?
What you been up to?
Oh yeah well that's cool, check it out
Me and you we been down for while, right?
We been here and there we been pretty tight
Something happened last night that you might get upset about
But hear me out
I didn't mean nothing by it, I'ma make this quick
I gave your mama this dick

I don't know how it happened
I just know my nuts and her itch were slapping
I was over there mowing the grass
And I could feel her eyes all up on my ass
And then, I went inside to make a phone call
And there she was with her titty hanging out her bra
One thing just led to another
Next thing you know, I'm butt-fucking your mother

Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately
Please don't hate me, I never said I loved the ho.
Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately
Please don't hate me, you never should've trust in a Juggalo.

Don't hang up, I still got more
Your momma gives head like a heroin whore
I wasn't thinking about how you was my bud
When she spreaded my butt cheeks and went for the Milk Dud
We broke out with your with grandpa's gin
Got drunk, I fucked her with a bowling pin
She's freaky
Her nipples look like peanuts
Your mama's one of my favorite sluts
She likes licking from the back of my balls 
to the tip of my dick with one big lick
She calls me her big teddy bear
Roooaaaaarrrrr!!!!!
I chase her around on my underwear
I'll admit I like spanking her butt
I used your sock though to catch my nut
Don't worry
I put it back, I knew you better
That's probably why your toes been sticking together

Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately
Please don't hate me, I never said I loved the ho.
Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately
Please don't hate me, you never should've trust in a Juggalo.

Your mom's ass look like oat meal yo
It's bumpy and grainy, I like to feel though
And I ain't trying to diss her either
I'm only saying that I'd wish she'd trim her beaver some
Every hair is like a foot long
Bitch looks like a werewolf wearing a thong sometimes
It's all right with me though
I don't mind as long as I can locate the V-Hole
And your dad's so dumb he's knowing nothing
Here I'm stuffing her muffin not to mention the pickle puffing
And I'm hoping you and me are still cool
I'm spending the night so she can drive me to school tomorrow
And we plan on fucking again
All right I'll talk to you later
Peace Eminem

Di-zam
Somebody just got fucked up
Nigga!
