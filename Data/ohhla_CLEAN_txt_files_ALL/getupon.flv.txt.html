UHH! Ah-yeah

[Verse One]
Y'all don't wanna make me war
What the hell is we fightin for?
I wanna make peace
In the South, in the North, in the West and the East
Everybody wanna listen to the President
Even though we ain't nothin but residents
Instead of goin for war
I'll get up on the dance floor
Get up on the dance floor
Everybody move your feet to the beat
Get up on the dance floor
If you wanna dance battle let's compete
Get up on the dance floor
DJ put that record on
Get up on the dance floor
Get up on the dance floor!

[Chorus]
(Get up on the dance, flooooor, c'mon)
Get up on the dance floor (c'mon) get up on the dance floor~!
(Get up on the dance, flooooor, c'mon)
Get up on the dance floor (c'mon) get up on the dance floor~!

[Verse Two]
I just now got off work (yeah boy)
I'm ready to go and hit the town (that's right baby)
My boss just gave me my check (hoooo)
I got crazy loot it's goin down (chop chop)
I'm goin to hit the first club (yeah)
Step to the bar, break out some dubs
Champagne, girls beats galore
I'll take it all to the dance floor
Everybody talk about how stupid Flavor Flav is
spendin his money in the club
But I'll rock, everybody in the party
This is my money, it belong to nobody!
Get up on the dance floor
Everybody move your feet to the beat
Get up on the dance floor
Get up on the dance floor!

[Chorus]

[Flavor Flav]
Break it down
Yeah Lord
Break it down
Yeah Lord, ha ha~!
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-HOOOOO
Get up on the dance floor
Everybody move your feet to the beat
Get up on the dance floor
Get up on the dance floor!

[Chorus]</pre>
