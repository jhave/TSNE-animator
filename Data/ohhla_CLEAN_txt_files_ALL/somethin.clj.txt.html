[Intro]
We're taking it back to the Coper
I'm your host, LL Cool J
We're gonna have a real classy sexy night tonight, you know what I'm sayin?
Everybody's dressed up real fly
Looking beautiful
Some beautiful people
And the healthy rock the house tonight
We have the great
Earth, Wind &amp; Fire
With Charlie Wilson &amp; Melody Thornton
Let's go!

[Chorus]
I love the world, there's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
I just wanna lay here with my arms around you
(Right there) There's something about you
(Something) There's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
We can lay here all day and baby just love your world

[Verse 1]
Let it ring
Love the ringtone, let it sing
Fall back under my wing
Let go of my mind, let it swing
Let em wait
Body language is how we communicate
I know it felt good, let it marinate
Multiple O's, increase your heart rate
So relax,
I put my lips on every inch of your back
Lookin good, I got plans for that
It's my pleasure to fall into your trap
Love the world baby, I was running lately
I did a 1-80, crazy

[Chorus]
I love the world, there's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
I just wanna lay here with my arms around you
(Right there) There's something about you
(Something) There's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
We can lay here all day and baby just love your world

[Verse 2]
Head in my lap
Massaging your ears, you like that
I bite your bottom lip, you bite back
I know it's good, I don't need you to tell me that
Kiss yo neck
Ignore the main spot getting wet
Pressure's built up high as it can get
So we flows like the pilot, press the jet
Let it stretch
For all the times you seduced me in the tracks
All the chasin I did so you can catch
Now all I do is shine and move back
Love your world baby, I was running lately
I did a 1-80, crazy

[Chorus]
I love the world, there's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
I just wanna lay here with my arms around you
(Right there) There's something about you
(Something) There's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
We can lay here all day and baby just love your world

[Verse 3]
Bottom out,
Kissing with your fingers in my mouth
I'm taking all different routes
Discovering the ins and the outs
You slide to the couch
I wanna see what that love seat is about
Work it til it looks like a pout
Too many climaxes to count
Love your world baby, yea it was born lately
Did a 1-80, crazy

[Bridge]
There's something about the way you do
The things you do
And when you do, oh tell me
I don't wanna go outside
I don't wanna go outside
I just wanna lay here with my arms around you night and day

[Chorus]
I love the world, there's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
I just wanna lay here with my arms around you
(Right there) There's something about you
(Something) There's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
We can lay here all day and baby just love your world

Sittin on the top of the world
Sittin on the top of the world
Sittin on the top of the world
Sittin on the top of the world
Sittin on the top of the world
Sittin on the top of the world
Sittin on the top of the world
Sittin on the top of the world yea yea</pre>
