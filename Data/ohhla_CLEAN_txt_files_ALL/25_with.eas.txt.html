(Intro)
Ski, don't foolin' with that piano man
Let's get into somethin' that's gangsta

(E-A-Ski)
And now what? What's crackin'?
25 with a meal ticket, yeah, and we ain't jokin' dog
youknowhatI'msayin'? Huh, all this perpetratin'
Who got this and who got what
Man, it ain't all what it cracked up to be
Look here...

(E-A-Ski)
Who's that G with the illest blood (let 'em known)
It's Mr. Ski (yeah!), spell my name correctly, fools wanna check me
Nigga wanna break me, ahh where the scrilla Be-M-W
3-25, oh he's a drug dealer
Huh-huh-huh-huh, mistaken identity, presidential Rolex (yeah)
Haters wanna rode next to me, maddoggin', shake the spot
But I'm down with the Heckler and Cock, ain't happy bout it
Hit 'em up with the SHOWDOWN, and every female that I see, they wanna get down
And you can bet that I'm gonna hit that (right)
It's my time and I'm gonna make up, for when I couldn't get down (gang-bang!)
Artist, producer, producer slash artist
Whatever you wanna call it, I'm legalized ballin'
Dog, you will never see the scrilla that follows me
Unless you hit the California LOTTERY!!!

(Chorus)
25, (25 with a meal ticket), believe that
Y'all wanna know why it's likes that
Just in case these niggas wanna hit me up
You know we gotta be the first ones to bust
(25 with a meal ticket), believe that
Y'all wanna know why it's likes that
Just in case these niggas wanna hit me up
You know we gotta be the first ones to bust

(E-A-Ski)
Can't believe that I fell for the oakey-doke, with these haters
Gave them love in the game (but's it all about the money player)
Tried to start a tight family, turned from my dog to a punk that's sheisty
Now, ain't gotta teach 'em about black balls (black balls)
Send your demos to the label never ever get a phone call
Mr. Ski be well connected, got a name in the game from the platinum records
Spell my name (M-I-S-T-E-R-SKI), and who else (C-to-the-M-to-theT)
And who else (I-to-the-M-to-the-G), representin' (O-A-K-L-A-N-D)
Get it straight, fool you can rap all night
But acapella ain't sellin' so your beats best to be tight
X wappin' your gums you better bow down
I hit my homies with the platinum sound

(Chorus)
25, (25 with a meal ticket), believe that
Y'all wanna know why it's likes that
Just in case these niggas wanna hit me up
You know we gotta be the first ones to bust

(E-A-Ski)
Money talk and VS walk, when I'm heated
Mess around and every rapper in this game will be deleted
(Puts it down), been waitin' for my album to drop
So you can check the sound scan to see if my album go flop
You're like a virus, spreadin' through the industry
Wishin' bad things on me, huh-huh-huh-huh... (uh!)
I can see the fear in your eyes when you walk through
it's Earthquake BABY until the day we shoot
Huh, you best to give it up when I'm bangin' (when I'm bangin')
tracks in your chest to keep your whole heart stayin'
Bout me, the dopest O.G. in this industry
And if you got tracks that's tighter, I'll put up 10 G's (10)
Better yet a meal ticket if you got it
You better ask my dog Master P, "How we rowdy bout it"
Back in the day when me and P used to kick it
In a minute, No Limit, days, we won a meal ticket

(Chorus)
25, (25 with a meal ticket), believe that
Y'all wanna know why it's likes that
Just in case these niggas wanna hit me up
You know we gotta be the first ones to bust
(25 with a meal ticket), believe that
Y'all wanna know why it's likes that
Just in case these niggas wanna hit me up
You know we gotta be the first ones to bust
(25 with a meal ticket), believe that
Y'all wanna know why it's likes that
Just in case these niggas wanna hit me up
You know we gotta be the first ones to bust
(25 with a meal ticket), believe that
Y'all wanna know why it's likes that
Just in case these niggas wanna hit me up
You know we gotta be the first ones to bust</pre>
