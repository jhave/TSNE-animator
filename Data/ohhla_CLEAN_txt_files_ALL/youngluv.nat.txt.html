Typed by: obi1one@hotmail.com

When you thought it was no love
It's always love around the world
When you think it's no war
It's always war

[Verse 1]
Ayo, ayo I almost got caught by this young bitch, a dumb bitch
I offered her ones, she wanted hundreds
She don't even drink, shorty sips SunKiss
Caught me on the one on one, always try to tongue kiss
She aint the type of girl that I'll have my son wit
Days are fun wit, fucked everywhere brought stuffed teddy bears
Told me that she loved me and she very scared
Up until now, she never trusted any man
She never knew about my other boo, comin through
My dimepiece teachin summer school, part time
At night, honey was a stripper
Givin cats lap dances, the money was quicker
Mid town Manhattan crib, shorty live by herself
Raisin little man, five and still shit on hisself
In the fridge, wasn't shit on the shelf
Roach legs and cheese
She was the head pro, you know she got a extra key
She met my dog, slept in my draws
Now she go in my pockets, intercept my calls
Like the other day, Young Love called me from school
She answered and hung up, arguments was brung up
For a hot second, hit me with tears, somethin not expected
Stared at my eyes like I got her pregnant
Said Nate, I never really ever want you to go
I said it's somethin that I want you to know

HOOK:
You're my Young Love
My lady (knawmean)
You're everything in this world there is to me
(That's the way it's supposed to be)
I gotta be with you, or someone
Fly Young Love, my Young Love

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, yo in the cut, Young Love still diggin her guts
In school sick, callin me to pick her up, jumped in the whip
Swervin on my way to Murry Bergdrom
I could tell by her voice phone call was kinda urgent
Lights I run through, she might be in the lunch room
I get there, sign her out, fakin like her uncle
Back to the rest, I give her Tylenol
The bitch supposed to be sick, showin no signs at all
Playin Sega, laughin cuz she made me wake up
My punishment, when all she really wanted was dick
Not thinkin 'bout my other chick, the one with the key
Off work at 5 o'clock, today somethin to three
Jumpin in while I'm humpin this freak, I heard the door lock
Nature I'm home, went straight for the phone
Call her friend up, talk ten minutes, me and shorty gettin dressed
No record, nothing more to discuss
She start flippin, put her bra on, she told her I'm wrong
The door opened, automatic time bomb
My lady blanked out, reach in her purse, pull a shank out
I side stepped, still she caught me on my bicep
My young shorty never tried to run
She stood there toe to toe with this hoe, and took alotta lump
Sheddin blood til one of them go
She a thug but I want her to know

HOOK

[Verse 3]
Uh huh, what, what, what
I woke up the next morning feeling guilty
10:30, the phone rang, shorty wanna bill wit me, chill wit me
Askin me to snatch her up
I couldn't tell it was fake, thought she wanna patch it up
Like it's all love, shorty's grill was all gauzed up
She tried to smile, though she sore as fuck
Apologize, tears ran outta my eyes
Not even one swear as I started to drive
Thought nothing of it, I put the tape on
See they caught up in some love shit, knowin they wrong
I pulled up right in front of the store, hopped out of the car
50 cent quickly got a cigar
Said we need to find a place where we can park and talk
Where police don't come, we can spark and talk
I know the spot, it's just about a block from us now
Comin up on your right, where we might could sit down
I never knew that my boo had a gun in her hand
Til she put it to my chest where she want it to land
Post up, before she let one of them go
I said it's something that I want you to know...
