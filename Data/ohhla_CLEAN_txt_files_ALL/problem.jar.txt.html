Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Wait a minute wait a minute
Ya'll don't know me like that nigga wait a minute
Wait a minute wait a minute
I'll crack your fucking skull bitch wait a minute

[Jarren Benton]
Yeah hit a nigga with an ice stick
Stab his heart with an ice pick
Soon as I get my royalty cheque Ima buy my bitch a pair of nice tits
Smoking dope and sippin ice slitch (cough) I'm sick
Your ho was choking up on my dick
So I hit the bitch with the Heimlich
Lurk the block for a trick of rock
Kick the door we don't twist the knob
Covering this bitch with a ninja mask start stabbing niggas with a shiskabob
Calamity the industry couldn't handle me
Am I the only guy who wanted to fuck Casey Anthony
I don't give a shit if she just killed the kid
And stuffed her in the trunk I'd still let that bitch suck my dick
Mad scientist rule with an iron fist
Fuck swag show up looking bummy I ain't on to shit
Jarren Benton pull your bitches hair extensions
Freebasing with Kevin Bacon
Popping pills with Paris Hilton
Twelve o' clock bitch where's your children
Stuff them in the stove and kill them
Take them out and throw them on your porch bitch now go and get them

[Chorus]
Wait a minute wait a minute
Ya'll don't know me like that wait a minute
I'll crack your fucking skull bitch wait a minute
Problem problem bitch I am a problem
I spent half my life just trynna make it out the bottom
Bottom bottom sickest from the bottom
I can't stop until I hit the top bitch got em

[Playboy Tre]
I got the Cadillac dippin
Brown liquor sippin
I'm a giant bitch my nest
Hanging from the fucking ceiling
Give a shit I don't give a fuck
Go ahead pull that up
Roll that up
Blow that pussy up C-4 in her gut
Drop the top throw a couple racks show these niggas up
Now they so agitated with my money maturations
I got Polo on my stitching bitches dripping while I'm ripping
Touch my family or my living I'll put bullets in your kidney
Kat-kat-kat just like that-that-that flat up on your back
Tell your folk to relax
Or ya'll gonna lose some partners back to back
Georgia's a rebel and you just a pussy honey buy my shovel
Cause our favorite rapper word till that diamonds in my bezel
Here we go Lincoln MKS
Panoramic view
Stomp the teeth up out mouth
I got some Nike's you can chew
Tre boy Play with my nigga Jarren Benton
Where we from?
East Atlanta that's the day
Bitch now where's my shot of rum

[Jarren Benton]
B-b-b-b-bitch I just joined the Illuminati
So drink some Jarren Benton fuckin' A dude its a party
Kicking with my kids we watching iCarly
And they always trash the fucking house with action figures and barbies
Yo momma said if I fuck her right then she'll buy me a Harley
I'm on that Breaking Bad shit doing meth in the back of an RV
Adidas on my feet I don't fuck with Ed Hardy
But I do endorse Bacardi
Bitch we do more coke then Charly
Sheen bling the telephone ring
It's TV-G bitch they cannot fuck with this regime
I'll break your fucking legs and then I'll wrap it in a sling
And bash it with a 2x4 and break them shits again
I'm crazy and deranged
Hey where the fuck is my brain?
They say these words that kill you so I spit like an M-16
They come equipped with an infrared beam
Got dust inside of my weed
And I was put here just to murder the game now bleed bitch bleed
Bleed bleed now bleed bitch bleed
We Freebasing bitch!

[Chorus]</pre>
