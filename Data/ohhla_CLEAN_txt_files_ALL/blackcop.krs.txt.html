Buck buck buck-buck-buck, buck-buck buck buck!
All rude bwoy lissen up!
Black cop!!  Black cop black cop black cop
Stop shootin black people, we all gonna drop
You don't even get, paid a whole lot
So take your M-60 and put it 'pon lock!
Take your four-five and you put it 'pon lock!
Lookin for your people when you walk down a block
Here in America you have drug spot
They get the black cop, to watch the drug spot
The black drug dealer just avoid black cop
They're killin each other on a East Coast block
Killin each other on a West Coast block
White police, don't give a care about dat
Dem want us killin each other over crack
Anyway you put it it's a black on BLACK
Black cop black cop black cop
Black cop black cop black cop
Thirty years, there were no black cops
You couldn't even run, drive round the block
Recently police trained black cop
To stand on the corner, and take gunshot
This type of warfare isn't new or a shock
It's black on black crime again nonSTOP
Black cop!!  Black cop black cop
Black cop black cop black cop

"Don't be the sucker..
 Don't be the sucker comin into my face..
 Don't be the sucker.."

Here's what the West and the East have in common
Both have black cops in cars profilin
Hardcore kids in the West got stress
In the East we are chased by the same black beast
The black cop is the only real obstacle
Black slave turned black cop is not logical
But very psychological, haven't you heard?
It's the BLACK COP killin black kids in Johannesburg
Whassup black cop, yo, whassup?!
Your authorization says shoot your nation
You wanna uphold the law, what could you do to me?
The same law dissed the whole black community
You can't play both sides of the fence
1993 mad kids are gettin tense
Black cop!!  Black cop black cop black cop
Stop shootin black people we all gonna drop
You don't even get, paid a whole lot
Take your four-five and you put it 'pon lock!
Take your M-60 and put it 'pon lock!
Take your uzi, put it 'pon lock!
Black cop black cop black cop
Black cop black cop black cop

"Don't be the sucker..
 Don't be the sucker..
 Don't be the sucker..
 Don't be the sucker comin into my face
 Don't.. don't be the sucker comin into my face
 Don't-don't-don't be the sucker comin into my face
 Don't-don't-don't-don't
 Don't be the sucker comin into my face
 Don't-don't, don't-don't
 Don't be the sucker comin into my face
 Don't-don't-don't!
 Don't be the sucker comin into my face with that yang-yang!"</pre>
