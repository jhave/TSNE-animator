[Lunch]
Whoo!
Highly anticipated
The wait is over
Diamonique, she here
Uh
Let's get it on

[Verse 1: Diamonique]
Just another night
And we headed to the club
I'm reppin'
I.E., so I'm throwin' up the dub
But it's all love
I'm bi-coastal
So don't trip with me
I might freaking have to go postal
Just tryin' to have a little fun, and do what no
Other emcee has ever done, and get a good
Run of beginner's luck, first time out
But my shit's still bangin' in the trunk
Question
Tell me what you know about sex
No doubt
I'll be putting y'all to the test (Freakism)
Ain't ya heard, mami know best
So tell your little friend
He can get a little rest
The night is young, and it's about to get hot in here
And my mind's so bling, my words spit like a blur (And I)
Talk with a slur, cause I'm all tow up
Fill me with Henessey, a glass of (???)

Chorus: Diamonique
Clap, people
Get ya clown on, baby, get ya bounce on
Players, get your talk on, white people, get your rock on
People all around the world
Holla at ya girl
We can get it on
Clap, people
Get ya clown on, baby, get ya bounce on
Players, get your talk on, white people, get your rock on
People all around the world
Holla at ya girl
We can get it on, freaky like The Thong Song

[Verse 2: Diamonique (Fingazz in background)
Even the Chinese, they got to feel me
Cause these words are deeper than all the seven seas
Fuck the bullshit
I came to get down
I came to act a fool
So put away the tool
Danger, danger, the club's full of strangers
Now what that man say, who was born in the manger
Love thy neighbor
But keep ya guard up
You can't trust no bitches, they livin' harder
Switch it back, now
Get ya mind right
One love ("Under the sun")
Nah, under the Street Light
This...
Is...
How we get loose
Sip gin, and sip goose, we'll call a big truce
And pack the peace pipe, like them indians who livin' well
Like you hit it big at the Sandman Well
Got Big Bucks, No Whammy, got chips, all that
Even one day, Demi, can buy a Grammy

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Diamonique (Lunch)]
Crouching Tiger, I smoke like a dragon
I'm all female, but my pants is still saggin'
Bags of reif', wifey, two braids, so unique
Say you freak, prove it now (PARTY PEOPLE!)
We 'bout to have a hoedown in the barn
Til the cows comes home, have fun, be alright
So pass the doochie, ya, pass the Oochie Wally
Wally, wally, bang, bang, walk, get ya gangbang

Repeat Chorus

[Diamonique]
Get it on
We can get it, get it, get it on, ma
Streetlight, get it on, now
909, get it on, now
Diamonique, get it on, now
Lunch, get it on, now
We might get it on, now
The Homeless get it on, now
Uh
Get it on now
Come on, now
You don't stop
Get it on, get it on
Get it on, now
You don't stop
You don't quit
Like, this
Uh

[Lunch]
That's Diamonique</pre>
