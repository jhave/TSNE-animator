[Verse 1: Kemo]
Chill lil' derty, I'm the nigga that'll make you grow
Take the cash that till them muthafuckas feel it and cant take it no mo'
Fuck a 10-4, I don't got a lil' ho, they call me lil' Kemo man
I bust through the do' ho wit a glock fo' fo', break up the whole crap game
Gimme ya change man, wit a ticket to ya mainframe
Watch a niggas brains hang, same thang every day, all day
Make the nigga a watermelon chain gang, slang 'cain
Watch a nigga gold chain hang, fuck a nigga matchin panky ring
Maintain, sub up a lil', play a lil' game of 20 mil a main frame
Off wit ya main thang, bitch told me the L truck pound gotta gain lane
Brains crammed, frame bitch gimme head cuz im a muthafuckin stage name
Hit the turnin lane, we put the foot on the left, what we did out here smokin Mary Jane
We be in the game till I heard a muthafucka talk about nigga needin our change
Well shit you did, plus not the real shit, pussy nigga get peeled quick
For a meal ticket, now ya ass dumped up cuz I know that you ain't gon kill no shit
Now kneel quick, put holes in ya heel fit, you fuckin wit a real nigga
Better chill nigga, one shot, one killed, 45 hundred tips in ya grill

[Hook: Kemo] - repeat 2X
Hit the turnin' lane, we put the foot up on left
What we did out here smokin Mary Jane
Turnin' lane, we put the foot up on left
What we did out here smokin Mary Jane
Turnin' lane, we put the foot up on left
What we did out here smokin Mary Jane
Turnin' lane, wit the foot up on the left
What we did out here smokin

[Verse 2: Kaos]
I'm that nigga that's blowin up the spot, makin everything hot
From my block to yo block, on top, ol' ballin ass nigga
Hmm me? hmm ho I think not ah, got skeet from 9 next to the block
There's too many niggas that I know from the block and uh
There's too many niggas that I know roll double O 1 drop tops
Urbody on the grind, urybody tryin to shine
Urbody sayin nothin bout time, urbody got a fine ass dime
Most of these niggas out herre can't rhyme, freestylin all day long
Talkin bout they label and all they songs, walkin around like the shit
But ain't made no hits, get ya pussy ass home, turnin on niggas on stage
Every four gettin paid, talkin bout the block and the yay and the hoes they played
Niggas in the crowd like "bullshit! fuck naw, no way!"
Nigga talkin bout they goin gold, on the road doin fucked up promo show
Check the sto' and never sold about 3 or 4 and the cd 4 months old

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Verse 3: Kemo]
Ah ah ah, hang out like double D bra, roll through the streets
Of the muthafuckin STL while the truck be calm, and a beatin ball
And you see me dogg when we be swervin to the curve in the bird
Got a couple niggas certain, fin to left the mo up in the urr (yes'ir yes'ir)
I'm in Atlanta on a fox now, rollin through Stone Mountain now
Drug addicts tryin to count the 9's, see roll like Kemo tryin to couple the one I'm foundin now
Many cases so I'm bound to find, so I'm gettin my ass off on 2 you feel me dogg
Rollin down 6 Drive dope fiend tryin to flick a nigga down tryin to get a 8 ball
Then they hit a rocky road, niggas over there clockin dough
Cops over therre tryin to stop the dope, in Kirkwood niggas say the herb would've
Ran out so nigga gotta constantly smoke
Caddie grill stop the flo', don't be talkin no stuff or the Bloods will get that smack
Real niggas from the ATL, stay up and represent the mirror or it makes you crazy

[Hook] - repeat 2X</pre>
