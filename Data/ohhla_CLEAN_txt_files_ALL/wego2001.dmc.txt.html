[DMC] One two three, in the place to be.. {*"be"*}
[Run] And this is Sugar Ray, and Run-D.M.C.
[R+D] HERE WE GO!

[hook 1: Run-D.M.C.]
D.M.C. and DJ Run
Dum-diddy-dum diddy-diddy-dum-dum
We're rockin on the mic and then you know where we're from
Dum-diddy-dum diddy-diddy-dum-dum
We hope y'all ready for the big beat drum
Drum-diddy-dum diddy-diddy-drum-drum
So people in the place here the big beat come
Here it come, here it come, here it kiddy-come-come

[Run]
Cool chief rocka, don't drink vodka
Used to keep cheeba inside my locker
Used to get to' down, now I slowed down
Hold the flow down from Motown to yo' town
I be the MC that rip it nightly
They said could be lucky, yeah might be, slightly
But if it's luck, then I'm the luckiest you know
I'm runnin this, king of rock yo, here we go

[hook 2: Sugar Ray]
In the history of the song
And the list be goin on and on
Since the days of rock'n'roll, Purple Haze, hip-hop'n'soul
So here we go.. {"Here we go!"}
Yeah!  Here we go now!
Yeah!  DJ Run

[Run]
Rhymes so def, rhymes rhymes galore lore
Rhymes that you never even heard before fore
Say you heard my rhymes, we're gonna have to fight
cause I just made the hot {shit} up last night
That's right I rhyme tight for cats on the block
Took it to new heights, look at Kid Rock
Y'all eat what I cook to put y'all on
So have a Limp Bizkit and a piece of Korn

[hook 1]

[both]
Deva-stating, mic controller
The word wiz-ard and the chief rock roller
[R] Bad b-boy made for the b-girls
Rock rulin rhymes as the turntable twirls
[R] Su-preme people who was born to talk
And over any corny rap king, we'll exalt!
[R] These are the kings from around the wayyy
{"Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay!"}

[hook 2]
