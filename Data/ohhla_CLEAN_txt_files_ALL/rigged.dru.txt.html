[VERSE 1: Knumskull]
I was hella drunk one night
Had a gang of dope in the trunk that night
And drivin with one headlight
Saw some hoes by the bus
Then hit a couple of donuts cause I like to have hoes on my nuts
One said 'fasten your seatbelt quickly'
That was a cap so that bitch could get with me
I was drunk and she knew it
When I speeded past police and that muthafucka T. Lewis
I tried to smash but they swooped me
I'm in first place, a high speed chase, I'm leavin em in my hooptie
The bitch mumbled "Let me out" (Hey, let me outta here!)
Took a second look and she was chewin a half a ounce in her mouth
I tried to pause and shit, she hit the fog
I had jumped out quick and got ran over by a sidekick
Task hit they brakes, too late
Ran straight into the sidekick, fucked up the bitch's face
I think the accident killed her
But that's the first time a nigga got away drivin a fo'-cylinder
They called for re-inforcement
I had a head-on collision with the police horsemen
Bounced, popped the trunk, got my dope
And my forty ounce, and went for muthafuckin broke
Finally made it to the spot, my nigga was hot
He had the clientele because he had the fat rocks

[CHORUS: Luniz (&amp; Dru Down)]
Sellin weight out your house (is a rigger)
Lettin a bitch keep your safe (now that's a rigger)
A fifth of gin to the face (there's a rigger)
(It's just another burial ground you muthafuckas gotta dig up)
Servin narcs in the open (there's a rigger)
A gang of niggas rollin craps (is a rigger)
Leavin your house without your strap (there's a rigger)
(It's just another burial ground you muthafuckas gotta dig up)

[VERSE 2: Yukmouth]
Kickin it with my niggas at the 'Twilight'
Zonin, must be on, this bitch won't let me out her eyesight
Cause she been starin for a long-ass time, gee
She's hella fine, a big behind, nice physique
Thinkin to myself: I gotta get her
Figured this top-notch bitch had a nigga
She said he just quit her
Her name was Sharlene and knew shit was she mean
With ass bustin all out her Guess jeans
Seems kinda sprung on that Oak nigga (Where's your broad?)
I don't have one cause all these hoes are gold-diggers
So I ain't lookin for a romance
She giggled a little and then she asked me do I wanna slowdance
I started grabbin on that ass, hops
But when I felt on that cock I musta hit the jackpot
Cause a nigga came out swingin
Right in the middle of a song that Levert fat-ass was singin
He snuffed the bitch in the mouth
I got bumrushed to the ground when security kicked us out
He had me trapped, I couldn't bounce
Picked up a bottle from the ground and cramped his ass with a forty ounce
Niggas buff as I park and hit
He was laid out on the ground with a lump in his dreads
My hands are red, I'm paranoid, man
The bitch had came out with some niggas to help her ex-boyfriend
My homie [Name] had got the sawed-off
I grabbed the bitch by her throat and damn near chopped her jaw off
I tried to scuffle but the nigga straight wrestled me down
On the ground, cause he had bigger muscles
My homie sprayed the shit like a chopper, gee
I screamed out "Help!" cause I had a dead nigga on top of me
Popped his homie, then we left the bitch
Buckshots blew his whole muthafuckin chest to bits

[CHORUS: Luniz (&amp; Dru Down)]
Sellin weight out your house (is a rigger)
Lettin a bitch keep your safe (that's a rigger)
A fifth of gin to the face (there's a rigger)
(It's just another burial ground you muthafuckas gotta dig up)
Servin narcs in the open (there's a rigger)
A gang of niggas rollin craps (that's a rigger)
Leavin your house without your strap (is a rigger)
(It's just another burial ground you muthafuckas gotta dig up)

So don't slip, nigga
Looney Tunes in this muthafucka
(Is we?)
Got to say what's up to my partner C&amp;H
What's up you ballin-ass nigga, you?
( *shout outs* )
That nigga Dru muthafuckin Down
(Givin that gat to them bitches, youknowmsayin?)
Still the Pimp of the Year, youknowmsayin?</pre>
