Regulators - we regulate any stealing of this property
We're daaamn good too
But you can't be any geek off the street
Gotta be handy with the steel
if you know what I mean, earn your keep
REGULATORS!  MOUNT UP!

[Warren G]
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
just rollin in my ride, chillin all alone

[Nate Dogg]
Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
on a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
all you skirts know what's up with 213

[Warren G]
So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
some brothas shootin dice so I said "Let's do this"
I jumped out the ride, and said "What's up?"
some brothas pulled some gats so I said "I'm stuck."

[Nate Dogg]
Since these girls peepin me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
On to big and better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

[Warren G]
I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
they took my rings, they took my rolex
I looked at the brotha said "Damn, what's next?"

[Nate Dogg]
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

[Warren G]
They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin in my own town
If I had wings I could fly
let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

[Nate Dogg]
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
now they droppin and yellin 
it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
if you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

[Warren G]
Now Nate got the freaks, and that's a known fact
before I got jacked I was on the same track
back up back up cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G

[Nate Dogg]
Just like I thought 
they were in the same spot
in need of some desperate help
the Nate Dogg and the G-child
were in need of something else
one of them dames was sexy as hell
I said "ooo I like your size."
she said "my car's broke down and you seem real nice,
would ya let me ride?"
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
the next stop is the Eastside Motel

[Warren G]
I'm tweaking
into a whole new era
G-Funk
step to this
I dare ya
Funk
on a whole new level

[Nate Dogg]
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble

[Warren G]
Chords
Strings
We brings
Melody
G-Funk
where rhythm is life
and life is rhythm

[Nate Dogg]
If you know like I know
you don't wanna step to this
It's the G-Funk era
funked out with a gangsta twist
if you smoke like I smoke
then you high like everyday
and if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate</pre>
