[Akon]
Said, "I ain't got time"
Ain't got time

Pre-Chorus: Akon
"Got no time to stop and speak
To friends, passing by" (Said, "I ain't got time")
"Got no time to stop and speak
To friends, passing by" (Man, I ain't got time)
"Got no time to stop and speak
To friends, passing by" (Pass me by)
"Got no time to stop and speak (Pass me by)
To friends, passing by" --&gt; The Glass Bottle

Chorus: Akon
Cause I gotta be
On my way (On my way)
I ain't got
Time to play (Time to play)
I can't go
Broke another day (Broke another day)
No way, jose (No way, jose)

[Akon]
Cause I ain't got time

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
My lifestyle's so cold
Holla
For the gold
Some say I'm too drunk
Some say, I'm too blowed
And rolling with kilos, and stackin' 'em C-notes
Watchin' my cheese grown, and blowin' on trees, though
And I really can't help it, I'm addicted to timin'
Gorilla grimin', no time for groupies or freestylin'
Want it green as a gecko, I'm respect for the summer, y'all
But some of y'all be frontin', I don't owe shit to none of y'all
I got bills to comprehend
Bubbles be poppin' in
Waitin' and watch 'em when
They can take my block 'em
I'm in, and out of track, supplyin' they bad habits
The game is gettin' graphic, but mayne, I gots to have it
Son of, a drug addict, but it ain't no excuse
I got these money makin' skills, I'm a put 'em to use
And I ain't doin' too much, y'all just ain't doin' enough
And I refuse to let a "so-called" ruin my stuff

Repeat Pre-Chorus &amp; Chorus

[Akon]
Cause I ain't got time

(Verse 2)
I'm movin'
Ain't got nothin' to say
Cause twenty fours ain't enough time in the day
So time, doesn't exist
Ain't no watch in my wrist
Def' a peck on the cheek, means death
Watch for the kiss
I stay calm under pressure
By any means or measure
Remember one's trash is another man's treasure
Business before pleasure, I'm disciplined and I'm focused
Why you rap cats battle to see who dopest?
I'm in the trenches, face down in the game, brah
And can't nobody know my real name, brah
Livin' in the season that killin' for no reason
If I make it past thirty, then I'm overachievin'

Refrain: Baby Bash
Believein' in the truth, believin'
In the way
The light, that I follow might bring a brighter day
In the truth
In the way
The light, that I follow might bring a brighter day

Repeat Pre-Chorus

       One day, I'm a get it together
[Akon]      Cause I'm a get it together
[Baby Bash] One day
       I'm a get it together
       One day, I'm a get it together

[Baby Bash] One day
       I'm a get it together (Go get it together)
       One day, I'm a get it together

[Baby Bash] One day
       I'm a get it together (Go get it together)
       One day, I'm a get it together (I'm a get it together)
[Akon]      Said, "I'm a get together..."

[Akon]
Go get it together (Gotta get it together...)
Gotta get it together...
Go get it together (I been grindin' forever...)
It's time that I get it together...
Get it together...
Yeah

Get it together...
Said, "I get it together..."
