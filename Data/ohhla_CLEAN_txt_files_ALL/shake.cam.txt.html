Killa! Jones! Freaky! Santana! Come on!
Shake, shake, shake (uh!)
Shake, shake, shake (Uh!)
Shake, shake, shake (uh!)

[Verse 1 - Cam'Ron]
Yo, who wanna mess with me, or come mess with me
Be a mess to clean, call me Mr. Clean
The way I glitz and gleam, trigger team
Click the Beam, hit the fiend (?) on me
Lookin like I'm nicotine
But it's all for the green like Listerine
Had to diss the queen thinkin I'm gon' get her jeans
I ain't Ginuwine, ma, my mission's mean
All my nigga team fix the fix get the cream
I sit in Bahamas, with Alyssa Milano
Got the Crist' and the ghanga and its gettin un-karma
Comma, now she cryin she missin her mama
Just a steppin stone for me now I'm hittin Madonna
And she twistin the fauna as we sit in the sauna
Guess it's just my persona, got her kissin my condom

[Chorus]
We're the Dip, so cut the shit
Ma twist your hips and lick your lips
We're the Dip, so cut the shit
Ma twist your hips and lick your lips

[Bridge - Cam'Ron]
Ma you straight frontin', let's get the date jumpin
See your booty panties, ma shake something
Shake something, shake something
Shake-shake, shake shake something

[Verse 2 - Cam'Ron]
And I got some girls, bout five or six
And a five and six, about five or six
I surprise the chick, that's when her eyes get lit
Let her drive the whip, see if she ride a stick
Who as live as this? My pool size is sick (sick)
But swim in my pants and dive for dick
They call me Moby, my pos-i-tive
Tell them free Willy if your thigs are thick
And your ass if fat and your head is right
And your dough is good, we can smash tonight
Right here in the car, ma, at the light
If you ask for cash, oh I'm mad for life
Kiss ass, you dyke, and I'm fast to fight
If you get mad, (??) grab a bite (what?)
Or I stab it light and we'll grab a bite
Is it crab you like? Lobster appetite

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3 - JR Writer]
In front of the club, drops, coups and trucks
I'ma front in the club with a hundreds of studs
A gun and some bud through the metal detector
The metal detect ya, settle and wet 'cha
I don't mettle with extra, you fakes and clowns
I walk in and get out of the club safe and sound
Silencer, dog, how safe it sound?
I got apes and hounds, he just pace around
And I'll lace you down, but I'm lookin for
A Manahttan ho or a Brooklyn whore
A Bronx biatch that'll let me look and explore
Up front but beat around the bush for sure
'Til the tush is sore, hit it doggy style
Get it doggy style, you know your doggy's style
I'ma mack or more and it's smash or more
A VIP up between the bathroom stalls

[Chorus]
