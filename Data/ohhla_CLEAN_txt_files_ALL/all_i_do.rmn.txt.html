[Intro: Redman] + {unknown}
Ay what's good man? {What's good?}
Yessir {Mm-hmm!}
Love hip-hop baby {Love that music baby}
Where all my peoples at out there?
All my ladies, all my fellas
Make some noise out there~!
I just love music nigga {Hell yeah}
Yessir {Uh-huh!}
Michael Jackson, we love you dog

[Redman] + (Faith)
Hey! I wake up, open my eyes, and light the aroma
And then I get my, ahh-stretch up and mornin yawnin
Yeah, I'm ready to grind wit'chu on my mind
Cause (all I do is for you)
Yo, I love how you make me feel when I'm broke
Make it clear when I smoke, my career on the ropes
So I, reappear and then I clear my throat
Nigga (all I do is for you)
Yo, since a DJ at 15, I was a young gun
Music disciplined me, now I'm a M-16
And all my dreams are turned into cream
Cause (all I do is for you)
Yeah, my heart's in it, weight up, shit and sleep in it
My pen put an end to any track you give me in the clinic
YEAH I, gets it in, rude bwoy I ain't finished nigga
(All I do is for you)

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
How, I listen to you when I'm drivin
Time and time you're always on my mind and
I'm talkin 'bout my music
(All I do is for you)
Keeps me lookin good when I'm barren
Hot as the sky when I'm blazin
It keeps me focused on my end
(All I do is for you)
Oh, it starts when I feel the flow
I'll be, into, overload
Talkin 'bout music
(All I do is for you)
It's sometimes critical
It starts when I feel the flow
I'm talkin 'bout music ('bout music)
I'm talkin 'bout music

[Redman] + (Faith)
Yessir~! When I fly, I got Dr. Dre headphones
playin T.I. and lookin in the sky, high
Think about when I land what I'ma buy
Cause (all I do is for you)
Yo, my boys hit the mall, I'm at the record store
I'm buyin my like 15th "Off the Wall"
MJ, hey! I hope you hearin this song
(All I do is for you)
Yo, I had the moonwalk down when I was 17
Now I rock and light blocks like Billie Jean
Whether you "Black or White" you gon' scream baby
(All I do is for you)
Yo, and I "Remember the Time" another part of me
was like "Leave Me Alone," I'm "B-A-D"
I opened up, now my music my "P.Y.T."
Believe that girl (all I do is for you) let's go!

[Chorus]
