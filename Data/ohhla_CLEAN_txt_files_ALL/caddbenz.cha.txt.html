[Chorus]
I look good in my 'Lac
Got that wood in my 'Lac
And I'm grippin' when I'm tippin' through the hood in my 'Lac
Yea I ride in my 'Lac
Open wide in my 'Lac
On 84s on them vogues when I slide in my 'Lac
Top dropped in my 'Lac
Got that knock in my 'Lac
And u can hear it cause I got the trunk popped in my 'Lac
Keep a glock in my 'Lac
Somethin' cocked in my lap
Just in case a hata trip tryin to plot for my (caddillac benz)

[Verse 1  Killa Kyleon]
From Houston to Chi-kango
Killa is the main ho
Rollin' wit ya main ho she lookin' like Jermaine ho
Caddy switchin' lanes slow
Hand fulla grain low
And the butta bucket to my button see my bang glow
Diamond chain hang low
Bricks of that Anglo
Saxan I ain't taxin'
for the low I let them thangs go
yea I'm the main ho
I do my thang ho
Might not be Indian but I can make it rain ho
I'll give ya fat kush that'll make them hoes quick
Ridin' dirth in my slab wit my Acres Homes chick
She from that 4-4
I got that .44
That'll leave yo shirt lookin'
Right where that boat low

[Chorus]
I look good in my 'Lac
Got that wood in my 'Lac
And I'm grippin' when I'm tippin' through the hood in my 'Lac
Yea I ride in my 'Lac
Open wide in my 'Lac
On 84s on them vogues when I slide in my 'Lac
Top dropped in my 'Lac
Got that knock in my 'Lac
And u can hear it cause I got the trunk popped in my 'Lac
Keep a glock in my 'Lac
Somethin' cocked in my lap
Just in case a hata trip tryin to plot for my (caddillac benz)

[Verse 2  Chamillionaire]
I'm pullin' up in the Benz
Hi Kappa like the fraternity
I'm the king of the currency
My money long as eternity
I ain't even a doctor but I'm really tryin to learn to be
Ridin wit the plastic givin' tha jacker
Plastic surgery
Now I'm lookin' glossy starin off and get a migraine
Lookin' like Sliver Surfer when I be slidin' on them wide swangs
I'm enjoyin my fame
Car ain't never dry mayne
Call me Superman
(YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU'LL) I'm super soaking my paint
23 inch shoes, who could be this smooth
doors doin' the suicide like you can be excxxused
plenty vehicles, so we creep wit tools
hatas lookin' for mechanics
trust that we them dudes

[Chorus]
I look good in my 'Lac
Got that wood in my 'Lac
And I'm grippin' when I'm tippin' through the hood in my 'Lac
Yea I ride in my 'Lac
Open wide in my 'Lac
On 84s on them vogues when I slide in my 'Lac
Top dropped in my 'Lac
Got that knock in my 'Lac
And u can hear it cause I got the trunk popped in my 'Lac
Keep a glock in my 'Lac
Somethin' cocked in my lap
Just in case a hata trip tryin to plot for my (caddillac benz)

[Verse 3  Killa Kyleon]
I pull a presidential I'm puffin that presidential
Money cup in my hand the other guidin' the double nickel (it's G2TM)
Yea ho I'm on my paper
I'm skipping through the city
Yea ho I'm on my racer
Choppin' choppin' up the corners
I give the block a shape up
That's right I kill a scene so go put the yellow tape up
(throwin' deuces out my ceilin')
some like I play my Jacob
that's right I'm on my job
I clock in for the hatas
Grown woman on my hood in that Superman pose
Big shiny grill like my car cant keep its mouth closed
Texan wire wheels
That's right, I'm on those
Don't got friends but I got 4s on my

[Bridge  Chamillionaire]
(Caddillac and Benz)
Drop the top slow
I can feel the breeze and let my leather seats show
(Caddillac and Benz)
For show
Leanin' on voughes and a set of elbows
(In my Caddillac and Benz)
hatas outsold
everywhere I go I got to grip my .44
(In my Caddillac and Benz)
I'ma crawl slow
I'ma crawl slow
Cause that's how playas roll
(In my Caddillac and Benz)</pre>
