Oh!

[Jeremih]
Hey
There she go
That's the one I've got to know
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you

How her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you

[Diggy]
It seems like for a while I've know ya
Nostalgic moments feels like magic don't it
Girl you killin 'em, my condolence
That's how you on it? Yea that's how you on it

And I'm gonna be with you no matter what it takes
Running with scissors in the traffic, tryna cut straight to the chase
Wanna be there when you wake
With no make up on your face
Not even gloss, before you brush
Love your dimples when you blush

It's the simple things in life we take for granted cause we rush
I just wanna gain your trust as well as me giving you mine
What's yo sign? I'm an Aries, I'm a 90?s baby clearly
I'll make sure to make some time for you though my schedule may vary

Hold up, hold up, hold up
I just wanna know ya
I heard 'em say that beauty's in the eyes of the beholder
Well girl my vision's bad so I'mma need you to come closer
Closer, now you right here where you suppose to

[Jeremih]
Oh!
Hey
There she go
That's the one I've got to know
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you

How her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you

[Diggy]
Excuse me Misses, may I spark your interest
Cause you sure got my attention, I just wanna grant your wishes (la la)
What you want you get it, I don't call it tricking
Not just cause I got it cause I want to, that makes all the difference
I'm about my business, and ooh girl you the business
We should get together soon so we can do some business
I got some things that I could teach ya, lemme show ya
Is you ready, what's the hold up

You ain't 'bout no drama, you remind me of my mama
Smelling like flower balm and Escada
Shut it down and you don't even try ta
You such a boss but carry yourself like a lady
The baddest out ya crew and that is not up for debating

Wait
Hold up, hold up, hold up
I know what they say
Every rapper only want that sexual healing Marvin Gaye
Don't believe it girl, I promise I'ma treat you like my treasure
I'm a movement by myself but I know you'll make me better

[Jeremih]
Oh!
Hey
There she go
That's the one I've got to know
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you

How her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you

[Jeremih]
Oh!
Hey
There she go
That's the one I've got to know
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you

How her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you

[Diggy]
Hey
Her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you

They don't do it like you
The prettiest girl I've ever seen by the way
Yeah, yeah!</pre>
