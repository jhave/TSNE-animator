Song:   The Crown
Typed by: playboy224@go.com

[Chorus: Sizzla] + [Ja ad libs]
They can't keep a good man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frown
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take may crown (let's get to the song)

Who Ja' Bless I say no man curse
Things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse
Here comes the officer askin for a search
They found no weapon, just only a draw first

[Ja Rule: Verse 1]
I know y'all niggas is second guessin the state I'm in
Bitch, I'm in to makin' hit records that spin like rims
So when "Flex" get it, he bomb it once, shit bomb it twice
New York city park your cars, turn off your lights
And "50" your hazards, cause when Rule' spit to the masses
I got yo attention like J-Lo's ass

[Jamacian Talking and Shots Fired]

[Ja Rule: Verse 2]
I know y'all niggas is second guessin the state I'm in
Bitch, I'm in to makin hit records that spin like rims
So when "Flex" get it, he bomb it once, shit bomb it twice
New York city park your cars, turn off your lights
And "50" your hazards, cause when Rule' spit to the masses
I got yo attention like J-Lo's ass
And if it's pussy we talkin' I come to smash em'
Personal foul like cole, when I sexual harass em'
Cause bitches want you beat it with passion
Niggaz want to you to clip up and clap em'
Hide the body like nuthin' happened
Niggaz need to get they money and stick to rappin'
Or end up like one of the Jackson's beware of your actions
Cause you don't wanna meet that desert e'
With that hair pin trigger so easy to squeeze
And no matter how you cut me I'm always chesse
Like "Black" said, It's a hundred and eighty-seven degrees
Muthafucka!!!

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule: Verse 3]
You know they can't keep a real nigga down (no)
Not what they niggaz can even wash up it's federal
Comin and puttin snicthes on a pedestal, glorify
Had to put niggaz in jail fo' life, ain't no blood in they eye
But who, Ja' bless 'em with tha sizzla touch
Thing's gettin better when they thought it would get worse
I bomb first, and breath in the heat, knowin to hell I send em'
And I ain't talkin' devils or demons, just be happy ya breathin
And cowards go to hiccupin' and sneezin'
leavin every soul cold, and bodies never a day old
Driving down on a yayo and dump it, like fuck it
Niggaz addict to hutslin, no one can ever be trusted
who told the feds' to rush ya
Why you fishin' for darken looking for sharks in the ocean to wise, coast to coast man
Just look around Rule' will never back down
And y'all can never ever take my crown (niggaz)

[Chorus w/Ja Talkin] - 'til Chorus fades
Yeah, Yeah, That's what the fuck I'm sayin..
Talk to 'em baby
Tell theses niggaz, what these niggaz know?
You know niggaz, no man touch this muthfucka right here
(Ya hear me?)
Niggaz going in they dreams to fuck with me, B
Murder inc (shit) Holla
Murder inc... yeah murder inc..
It's murder inc... we do this shit, we do this thang'
This thang we call drugs nigga
In the booth... lyrically
I gets the job done you know me baby
Holla back, Rule</pre>
