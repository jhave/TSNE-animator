Pull it pull it, Hey!
Pull it pull it, Pull it
Pull it pull it, Hey
Pull it pull it, Pull it!

[Bridge 1: repeat 2X]
See My Black Hand Piece Glo-Glow in The Dark
Go-Glow in the dark, Go-Glow in the Dark, Go-Glow in
the dark

[Bridge 2: repeat 2X]
Y'all don't know about me, y'all don't know about me
Y'all don't know about me, you better ask about me

[Hook]
I chase henny with henny, I'm Gooonne!
Baby I chase henny with henny, I'm Gooonne!
Baby I chase henny with henny, I'm Gooonne!
Baby I chase henny with henny, I'm Gooonne!

[Verse 1]
I chase henny wit henny, I'm Goooone!
It Got Me feeling like Heman, I Gets Groooowwn!
Came from the hood, where niggaz get Wrooooonng!
Where you get shot and die, cause the ambulance take loooonng!
Smoke on Grooowwn!, Ride on Chrooooome!
Get Drunk in the club but I still drive Hoooooome! I dooon't!
Stop at a mission, in a big ass hummer, not that H3 baby mama editon
But I didn't listen I sold rocks right in front of the
church and I had to Stop because my mamas a Christian
The more she prayed for me, the more that I kept sinning
I don't know how the hell that I kept winning, but amen

Cause I'm waaaasted!, I'm waaaaasted!, I'm waaaaasted!, I'm waaaasted!
I wont spill it on her cause I don't want to waaaaaste it!
I let the weed smoke chaaaaaase it!, Ho!
Cause I'm Waaaaasted!, that's the way I does!
Nigga we get drunk on the way to the cluuuubb!
The dash board looking like a table full of cuups!
Flats screens on the glass, got the cable in the truuunnk!

Same day we shoot the fair, same day you get jumped
