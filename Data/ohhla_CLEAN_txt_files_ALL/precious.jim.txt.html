[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
Shorty you precious.. and you gon' love how I put it down (yeah)
I see you watching.. so let's not mess around (no)
No hesitating.. cause I got what you're lookin for.. (Oh yeah, yeah)
And I got one word.. one word to describe ya..
Ohh, you're precious

[Rap: Jim Jones]
(Uh.. Jones)
Whoa, whoa, shorty
You know you precious (Sexy)
Hands down a little more then impressive..(Such a diva)
You could afford to be selective..
If you've got a man he needa be over protective.. (He betta watch out)
No game just telling you my perspective..(uh huh)
I would try to scoop you if I didn't even direct..(Without a deal)
She'll leave a nigga breathless, now who you came with is who they say you done left with.. (Jones)
You got a love her, every the morning you got breakfast
And she don't be goin through my phone like no detective (Babe)
Seeing me with you got them sicka than asbestos (Oh)
You aint gotta love it they gotta fuckin respect it..(You betta do that)
If I were you, I would get up on some neck shit
If I send the goons out somebody's gonna make an exit (Bird game)
She come and get me if I get arrested..(Oww)
lil' mama do the unexpected.. (Uh huh)
Cause Shorty's she's a ridah.. (Such a ridah)

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
Shorty you precious.. and you gon' love how I put it down (yeah)
I see you watching.. so let's not mess around (no)
No hesitating.. cause I got what you're lookin for.. (Oh yeah, yeah)
And I got one word.. one word to describe ya..

Ohh, you're precious

[Rap: Jim Jones]
Every Obama needs a Michelle.. (A first lady)
So little mama won't you be my Michelle..(Uh)
Michelle, my belle, I want you on my team.. can't you tell.. (Uh huh)
Wanna buy you pretty things like bags from Chanel..
Texting on the phone I got you laughin on your cell.. (You like that?)
SMH, LOL, with a smiley face (Nasty) talking dirty got me hotter than a fireplace.. (Go)
Whats the deal, is you tryna get baked, take you out the fridge and put your ass on broil.. (Go)
Treat you like milk I'll let your ass get spoiled.. (And?)
Said you wanna ride, I bought you brand new toys..(Take that take that)
So tell cupid that I seen my target, pretty face, and a body like a Greek goddess..(She's a dime)
A diva, closet like Neiman Marcus (C'mon) work on a new fashion before it hits the market..

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
Shorty you precious.. and you gon' love how I put it down (yeah)
I see you watching.. so let's not mess around (no)
No hesitating.. cause I got what you're lookin for.. (Oh yeah, yeah)
And I got one word.. one word to describe ya..
Ohh, you're precious

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
Shorty you precious.. and you gon' love how I put it down (yeah)
I see you watching.. so let's not mess around (no)
No hesitating.. cause I got what you're lookin for.. (Oh yeah, yeah)
And I got one word.. one word to describe ya..
Ohh, you're precious</pre>
