[Intro: Betty Wright]
This song goes out to all my nephews, sons 
and lil' cousins, you know who you are
Mmm... Try to tell you what to look out for
Y'know I got your back

[Chorus]
Get yourself a real woman 
So you can be a real man  
It's time to stop playing with girls!
You need a woman who will understand
Get yourself a real woman 
So you can be a real man  
It's time to stop playing with girls!
You need a woman who will understand

[Betty Wright]
There was a time when I was, wildin' out 
Hangin' with the crowd, talkin' way too loud  
When I think back to my, younger days 
and my, crazy ways that was, just a phase 
Now I don't wanna give you, wrong advice 
but you, got one life you can't, live it twice 
So when you choosing you just, take your time 
Ele-vate your mind, good you're, gonna find 

[Chorus]

[Betty Wright]
You might be stackin' money, mountain high 
so they're, gonna try, try to, catch your eye 
But all that glitters boy you, know ain't gold 
Some would, sell their soul, they're out, of control  
And I'm ain't sayin' that they're, all the same 
but they, all got game I won't, call no names 
So take my word I wouldn't lie to you 
'cause I love you nephew, here's what you gotta do! 

[Chorus]

[Betty Wright - Bridge]
I, know what you need (You need a woman who will)  
I, know what you need (You need a woman who will)  
When you get tired of playing in the sand box  
Want a woman who'll love you a whole lot  
You need, you need, you need  - you need a woman who will
Snoop~!

[Snoop Dogg]
+No Pain, No Gain+, this life the same thang
Been playin so many games, gotta find a slow dame
Sooner or later, no later, 'cause when he finally date her
He'll love her or either hate her, regroup or re'bilitate her
These are some real fly words from the wise one
I got my wife in my life, 'cause she's the right one
Better know it, better show it, everytime I step in
A real woman make a real man, and this is definite
Yeah

[Chorus]

{repeat in background}
You need a woman who will, you need a woman who will
You need a woman who wiiiill 

[Outro: Betty Wright]
Yeah, some of y'all just triflin'~! 
Do anything for a little bling bling
All of the green and gold diggin', yeah
That's how you make yo' dealin'
To all my daughters, the nieces, and my lil' cousins
You know I ain't leavin' you out
'cause I know some of y'all be tryin the best you can
But listen to this: 
{*sing a new chorus*}
If you be a real woman, then you can get a real man
I'm talkin' to you little girls
Tell me do you understand?
If you be a real woman, then you can get a real man
I'm talkin' to you little girls!
Tell me do you understand?
Tell me do you understand?
Tell-tell me do you understand?
{*back to talking*}
All you think about is blowin up ya whistle
But it goes like this: Use your wisdom
No schizm, no -ism, get your own blow-up-ya-whistle</pre>
