Here lizard, lizard...

Master P:
UUGGGHHHH!!!
Me and that nigga Mr. Magic together
We motherfucking bigger than life
Real niggas and bitches feel this

Real Soldiers gon' ride with me
Real killers gon' die with me
Real Soldiers gon' ride with me
Real killers gon' die with me

Look into these eyes of these thug niggas
Ex-drug dealers, love to plug niggas
Then we mug niggas
I know you fools wanna get us
But we rough like some lizards plus we bigger than Godzilla
So motherfucking ? and bury garden
So I'm the fire to this party and I came to get it started
So buda bu shuda, throw your motherfucking set up
Niggas player hate, motherfuckers get wetter

Chorus: (x3)
Buckle up nigga, knuckle up nigga
Who am I? The ghetto godzilla

Magic:
I'm gonna make it realest of real
For these niggas here ready to kill, bette guard your grill
Cause the weak get their caps peeled
Master P told me more money, more protection
So that's why when they signed me I got a tank and this ??
Many impotent families, but we don't give a fuck
We gonna put in our own work, wanna try your fucking luck?
Knuckle up, buckle up, and try your heart nigga
We all rowdy and bout it bout it from the south nigga
Only the real can feel this, if you listen you can here us
Ghetto superstars, bigger than Godzilla
We got the world shaking, I hope y'all ready for me
Only my thug motherfuckers gonna ride with me

Chorus x4</pre>
