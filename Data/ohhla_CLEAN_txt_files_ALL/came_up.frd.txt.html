Song:   Came Up From Nothing
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Man I came up from nothing
Turned nothing into something
Now my money steady coming
Man I'm chasing after money
Man I came up from nothing [x4]

[Verse]
Chasing after money I don't love no bitch
Only thing I love, Saran wrapping bricks
New plug, new connect, on the road taking trips
I'm chasing after money 'till my feet fall off
I'm headed to the top, I could never fall off
You say you want it hard, but I can give it to you soft
Make sure your family straight, the first step in being a boss
Sneak dissin', that shit get your head knocked off
Four in the morning and I'm still serving raw
Coming up you'd be surprised what I saw
Niggas dying every day where I'm from
Pulling up, black trucks with loaded guns

[Chorus]</pre>
