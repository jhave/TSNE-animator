[Verse 1: Tony Sunshine]
On the streets of New York [2X]
I was standing by the hydrin watching time fly by
Me and Crazy Lou, Tony Tuibe with them brown eyes
Conversating 'bout nothing just watching time fly
Nothing to do man except be with the crews and
That's when I seen the moon and the stars align
I'm talking 'bout when she walked on by
I thought I saw heaven, well

[Chorus]
I'm just giving it up for my baby
Giving it up for my darlin'
Giving it up for my baby
I'm thanking God that I found my darlin'

[Hook]
Make ya say well, (well) well well well
Heyyyyyy, we fell in love
On the streets of New York
On the streets of New York [2X]

[Verse 2: Tony Sunshine]
Now, If you wanna be my baby, darlin'
All you gotta do is call and I'll come running, well
Because all I live to do is be the one He meant for you
And what you want me to be I can be that honey, well

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Remy Martin]
You see I'm 21 sitting on them 23's so I
Guess I can see why a dude like you would like me
I got a box of duchess and a whole lot of weed
So why don't you and your dawgs come chill
With me and my b'z, It's really nice to meet you
See my name is Remi but if it wasn't then I bet
That they would call me Ice Tea because see
It's all frozen and then we both rolling so
Start rolling so we can start rolling tall
I'm the type to put ya trust in and I got a big
Truck that we can crush in and see I'm not
Scared to have a one night stand cause after one
Night guaranteed you're gonna wanna be my man

[Hook]
