[Verse 1]
Yo, I welcome New York to an extravagant event
And Blo and J30 got the Franchise bent
Low under tint, snakes, hustlers, and pimps
And I'm the main event at any event
Shit, I pop shit like "No he didn't"
Shoulda seen nigga's face when I four-five-six
Terror Keys parked longside of MPV's
Run the, light with me, part empty three
Yo quickest lyrical draw, that'd be me
A jewel to the hustler, stack your cheese
On the rise, on the come up, use less cut
Customers complain, you just fuck
Yo rackin your brain with that bullshit game
And beatin on yo' bitch don't ease the pain
Ok, back the facts like gats and cracks
And I'm hot fuckin quarters with my people mack

[Verse 2]
Miami, wave your drawers, break the door
Little finger up scream "Fuck the law!"
New York, flash ya lights, the party right
Rollies in the sky, hold 'em up high
Wave them platinum rings, from side to side
Show the bitches the keys to the six outside
Get it to poppin, get them drops to droppin
Sittin on twenty, representin money
Indiana ecstasy, sex is deep
Buy me a drink bitch the sex on me
DJ spin it back "Hell yeah" I'm feelin that
This party off the hook, Long Island off the hook
We do it like no one else, it's serve self
