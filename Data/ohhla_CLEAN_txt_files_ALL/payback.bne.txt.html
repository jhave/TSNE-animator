(Krayzie) 
Raw, raw, raw. . . 
Retaliation is a must, nigga 
The enemy must suffer the muthafuckin' consequences 
Deadly. . . 
Yeah, I want all of these muthafuckas dead 
I don't wanna see one muthafucka left breathin' 
Kill all these muthafuckas 

(Chorus) 
Them niggas be killas 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period 
Bloody, bloody murder. . . 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period 
Killa . . . . 

(Krayzie) 
I'm thuggin off in my house out in Cleveland 
Weeded, I'm sleepin', P.O.D.'ed 
Dozed off, but I was awakened by the telephone ringin' 
I picked it up 
Hello? At first, nobody would answer me, so I said it again 
Hello? Somebody starts breathin' 
Not thinkin', I hung up the phone 
Niggas be playin' jokes, I payed it no mind 
It could've been just my fuckin' friends 
Then I sat back and closed my eyes
no more than four seconds, it rung again 
Hello?   And why in the fuck is you playin'? 
Somebody yelled out, "You die!" 
Before I could even reply, 
some nigga jumped right through the window buckin' a pistol 
I jumped out of the chair, grabbed the bullets on the way to the stairs 
Feelin' hot bullets fly over my head 
Thinkin' for sure that I'm gonna be dead 
Scared? Oh yeah! 
So I turned around and ran out the backdoor instead 
Them niggas was steadily buckin' 
Whoever was dumpin', they surely did want me in the red.   
Continued to fled--hit a couple of fences 
Thinkin' 'bout who could have did this? 
Retaliation: I'll handle my business, kill 'em--as God as my witness 
I called up my niggas; they ready for war 
Kill 'em's the way that we even the score 
If you did not come for war, what in the fuck you come here for? 

(Chorus)x2 
What you niggas be?  Killas . . . 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period 
Bloody, bloody murder . . . 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period 
Killa . . . 

(Bam) 
Five infrared dots, trail by these steel toes runnin' in your spot 
You smokin' hot 
Gather troops, destinations be your block 
The stakes is high since '94 
Got your tightest G for ransom 
Maybe unhand 'em and let him go 
Hell no, you shouldn't've chanced it 
It's not essential, got smoked, only deaththreats on your boast 
So take it as a quote, get violent if you see me, loc 
We deadly--step, pay your sins, you'll die a thousand times 
He's found with open eyes, and mesmerized, no vital signs 
That's fifty mercenaries that blood money can't afford 
Jump out of new Accords 
??? got two swords 
A deadly ?, fate been chosen 
Get your eyes swollen 
I roll and dreams we're golden, and now your hood we controllin' 
You tellin' lies, caught you slippin' up at your Mama's house 
Should've took you out, but I told my homies throw you out 
Better thank your stars, relocate anywhere close to Mars 
Stop actin' hard, you got more than you bargained for 

(Chorus) 
You niggas be killas 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period 
Bloody, bloody murder . . . 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period 
Killa . . . 

(Bam) 
We leave 'em shell-shocked, forty glocks and dirty looks and pop shotz 
We verse 'em twice; murda books police, 'cause scared of heights 
It's cowards versus niggas, been shook
didn't recognize the way your body hangin' from a hook 
Thugline don't play 

(Krayzie) 
Shit! 
Dog, I done told 'em 
We'll rode 'em 
Ho ain't got no scrotum 
Slippin' in a clip and reload 'em, and when they jump 
Yeah, we gon' unload 'em, and hit 'em wherever, however they want it 
We gon' make sure no one's alive or left to identify me 
It ain't over until you die 

(Chorus) 
Them you niggas be killas 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period 
Bloody, bloody murder . . . 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period 
Killa . . . 

Them niggas be killas 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period 
Bloody, bloody, murder 
Don't be fuckin' with the killa, killa, killa, killa 

Them you niggas be killas 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period 
Bloody, bloody murder . . . 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period </pre>
