Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[KRS-One]
Get your hands up!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Where my people that's, over 20 now
Where my people that's, over 30 now
Where my people that's, over 40 now
Classic, that's what they call us now

[KRS-One]
It's your teacher, welcome to my classroom
Who's he, what's that, yo you better ask soon
It's the K to the R to the S One
By now, I think it's real, I'm the best one
Yes son~! I take it to the old school
I spit superrhymes cause "I am so cool..."
... a duel?
You must be fool, player you know the rules!
I take it to the old school quick
Get Fresh Crew, Doug E. Fresh, "The Adventures of Slick Rick"
It gets so sick, cause I ain't no joke
This song goes out to grown folk like Tone Loc

[Chorus]

[KRS-One]
I'm "Smooth" like Big Daddy Kane, no bull
Check out "My Melody," I'm "Paid in Full"
Before "The Chronic" I was Stetsasonic
Old school, true school, oh yes sir I'm it!
1985 bumpin Mantronix
1995 gettin slammed with Onyx
2005 doin shows with comics
2015 we still gon' rock shhhh
With dough, 'dro my flow in the pocket
I'm already 40 some say I need to stop it
Call ME when it's time to really hip-hop it
I'm true school, if you wasn't there don't knock it!

[Chorus]

[KRS-One]
Every year I get newer, this goes out to the future
Just like Slick Rick the Ruler, KRS a true schooler
You wanna be down man when I'm layin it down man
Place all packed I'm bringin the heat with soundman
C'mon lay it down man! Movin the crowd man
Television viewin is down man
Radio listenin down man; you can't say
you was doin it better than we was around man!
We was down for the Rage and we was Against the Machine
Now we turned the page and we the mainstream
Servin the same fiends, but are we on the same team
that was prophesied in Dr. King's dream?
No matter how things seem I stay with the original plan
Teachin our children original man
And who's the "Criminal" clan?
My '86 lyrics then you hear it helped you build and expand

[Chorus]
