[Chorus: Ja Rule] + (Ashanti)
(I wanna be your chick)
(I wanna be down for you)
Do you trust me? (Yea) Love me? (Yea)
You puttin it on me? You must be
(Your down ass chick)
(I wanna be your chick)
And only for the Rule baby
(I'll ride for you) Yea (And die for you) Yea
(Do anything you want me to; I'll be your down ass chick)

[Ja Rule]
Yo - this is no intention of bein offensive to women
By calling y'all bitches, my down ass bitches
Still my queen, princess cuts look clean
on that finger next to the finger you flipped at me
And there's no in between me and you, only me and you
Who else gon put it on ya, like the Rule
And God only looks after children and fools 
And you're not - so who gon' look after you?
Just Rule baby

[Vita]
True baby, it's only for you baby
Vita's thighs only divide, if you inside
Cause I, love the way you touch me nobody can get it
And if it's comin or gunnin just considered it's spitted
So when you gone fo' a minute, I just fantasize
Like if it's you that's all in it, then I'm satisfied
'til you come back to me, holdin stacks and jewels
V-I-T-A and my nigga J-A, Rule baby

[Chorus]

[Ashanti]
I'm gonna be here when you need me
Rule baby, can always count on me
And you don't ever have to worry
You know I'll make it in a hurry
Here for you and I will never leave
Shed tears for you, cause boy you got to me
There will never be another for me 
You'll always be my one and only

[Ja Rule] Baby girl, would you bust your gun wit me?
[Ashanti] Yea, yea
[Ja Rule] Lie to the Feds if they come get me?
[Ashanti] Yea, yea
[Ja Rule] And if I died, would you kill for me?
[Ashanti] Yea, yea
[Ja Rule] Do you trust in me?
[Ashanti] Yea, yea
[Ja Rule] Are you lovin me?
[Ashanti] Yea, yea, yea 

[Ja Rule]
Yea, let's get it gwenin' like we Ashford and Simpson
Or Ike and Anna Mae on one of they good days
You smile like sun rays 5'5 with brown eyes
and thick legs, only for the Rule baby!!

[Chorus]

[Charli Baltimore]
Now baby, I told you I can show you better than I can tell you
Blow trial, who bring commissaries and mail
you them sweet words and naked flicks?
I'm still that pretty down down ass 2 cars behind your 6
And I detest any clown that's clockin my round ass
Only a down ass, and it's ALL for you
I grown a tad bit since we've been at it like rabbits
The booty a lil' plumper and it's (alll for Rule)
Shit, who gon' love you like that?
Thug with you with it stacked to the ceiling or splittin a dub with you
Cause I play my position with cold D's, O.G.'s
Until that bloodshed, blood red, or we O.D.
Remember every word that you told me?
(Just show me!  Hold me!)
All you need in your life is Chuck, drugs, and dubs
Or 22's, now tell me who the honey for you? .. Chuck

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
