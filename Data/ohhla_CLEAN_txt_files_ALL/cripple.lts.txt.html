(Violent J talking)
"Scaryness....your butthole just spit in your pants...
Scaryness...what's scary is not knowing what "what" is...
Something...scary"

(Shaggy 2Dope)
When I start to think, my skull begins to crack
Could it be the infection in my head trying to get me back?
'Cause the more I look at myself, the more fuck I dunno!
The more I think about it, I think my fucking heads gonna explode

(Monoxide Child)
Wig splittin', leavin' all your family member's dead
I can't explain it, so I just blame it all on my head
Paranoid, shakin' in closets when I'm done
I think I'm hiding from the fact that I just slaughtered everyone

(Jamie Madrox)
I wash my hands so many time's that they crack and bleed
But water purifies, washes away and makes me clean
My soul is so dirty, I tried to wash it to
And get something together and figure out what to do

(Blaze Ya Dead Homie)
The voices in my head keep driving me crazy
I got my Glock cocked, and loaded with no safty
Empty trigger finger and I'm ready to release
Cause something keeps telling me "Increase the Deceased" (well come on)

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Something's talking in my head
I can't help thinking it hates me
Something's telling me I'm dead
It's going to cripple and rape me

(Marz)
They're telling me the secrets how to build a spaceship
Out of 2 bags of bar-b-que potato chips and rabbit shit
I gotta pocket full'a middle fingers, when I need good luck
I stick'em all up in my ass, spin in circles then I cluck
And if you try to read my mind, i'll call upon my Mockaloba
Have the energy of four dimensions fuckin' on your momma
Got the fetus on a freestyle, did you feed the pilot's?
Simple tip and keep a noose rised, call me Tripacoba

(Shaggy 2Dope)
Peekin' through the window, I think I'm falling for this chick
'Cause when I look down, somehow I'm dry fuckin' a brink!
Why is it when she see's me she's gotta scream!?
Now I gotta jump through the window and gag her with my stiffy again!

(Monoxide Child)
I just want to split my neck and back in half
And when the reaper comes to get me I'm a even go &amp; kill his punk ass
Post modern vibrator, scary like an alligator
Bitch your dying now, 'cause you aint even seein' later

(Jamie Madrox)
I was raised in a way that corrupted my mind
I watched my family abuse each other at the drop of a dime
And fucked my head up so I can't think straight
Who can I confide? who can I trust? who can relate?

(Blaze Ya Dead Homie)
Something keeps telling me to put you underground
And dump you in the river so your body never found
Then go home and call the cop's, and tell'em what I did
And when them suckers show up, MURDER ON A PIG!!!!

[Chorus]

(Violent J)
That dog is talking to me
They're dead dog's, they don't do that do they?
That dog is scaring me
Haahaahaahaahaahaahaa (*2X*)

(Shaggy 2Dope)
Shut the fuck up, quit telling me what to do
Blaze, J, Mono, Madrox, is that you?
No, it can't be, it's me sitting alone in the rain
Fuck this bullshit, and the pain!

(Jamie Madrox)
You can say that I'm different, and not a normal man
you can say you hear me but you really don't, just understand
Tryin' to explain, I like to yell when knifes fling
So you can understand how it feels to be in pain

[Chorus]</pre>
