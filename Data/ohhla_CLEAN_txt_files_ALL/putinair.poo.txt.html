[Intro]
Yea! RAPPER!
J-O! Hah!

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I'm rap's Lamar Odom, bunch of new niggaz 
wanna hang by the scrotum, peep what I told 'em
Dope shit find dope ears (oh!)
If you ain't dope, nigga don't shed tears
Don't ask yo' momma, she don't count as a peer
Don't ask ya boys, they just wanna be near
The money rollin, they ain't bein sincere
Got a hot line, nigga what about career?
Wanna scrutinize every move I engineer
As the world turns, I begin to see clear
I'm an art teacher, homie this is my craft
Can't fuck with me, you can transfer out the class (damn~!)
Just cause you young, don't mean you get a pass (nah)
Excuses y'all make make a nigga wanna laugh (HahAHA!)
Let out a big chuckle - hardy har har
I'm eight years in, will you make it this far? (Naaaw!)

[Chorus]
Don't com-pare (pare) me to your average
Know it ain't fair (fair) standin room money
So you know we in here (here) Reservoir Dogs
So you best beware - PUT IT IN THE AIR
Don't com-pare (pare) me to your average
Know it ain't fair (fair) standin room money
So you know we in here (here) Reservoir Dogs
So you best beware - PUT IT IN THE AIR

[Joe Scudda]
Chiddy Chiddy Bang Bang
Why do you remain on doin the same thang?
Ridin on the same lane, as I beez in 
You the 55, I'm doin a buck breezin 
Got all the haters wheezin, from the joint
that the weed's in, sit it down, let ya knees bend
Just don't compare to no regular cham
(No!) Joey just a regular man
Though would lend a hand for a fam
But damn! I don't fuck with stans
Tryin to see a buck or a euro
Me and Rapper, like Pacino and Deniro
Put it on a C-note, doin like "Casino"
Or maybe "Righteous Kill" and I might just peel - BAP!
Any rapper think he write this ill is wack
Yeah I said it and I don't regret it
So go and tell 'em 'bout it

[Chorus]

[Outro: Rapper Big Pooh]
Diplomacy season is over, muh'fuckers!
Diplomacy season is over! I ain't takin no more shit!
I'm 'bout to take this thing to another muh'fuckin level
HOJ, Reservoir Dogs, muh'fucker
Black Milk, waddup?! Hex Murda, uh!
All my Midwest niggaz! Heh... IT'S THE NEW ME, NIGGA!
You muh'fuckers better get ready.
"Dirty Pretty Things" is on the muh'fuckin way
This is what we do all day, nigga!
All muh'fuckin day, how you say it, J-O? Aw-riiiight!
Hahaha! Dey ain't ready, dey ain't ready
HAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA~!!!</pre>
