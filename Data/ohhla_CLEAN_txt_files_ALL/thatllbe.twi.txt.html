[Lil Wayne]
Now let me brush off my Pu..
Now let me..
Now let me..

Now let me brush off my Puma's
This is for the early birds and the late bloomers
My fitted cocked and so is the boomer
My money ain't funny, but they got a since of humor
And everybody dies, but snitches die sooner
Paint your shirt and room like a Oklahoma Sooner
I'm out of this world, lunar
I've got cheese cake like juniors'
The coolest kid on the school yard
Higher then a uniform, scared?
I got work at home, call it home work
I got paper in my backpack
I know you smell me, I'm the shit like an exlac... Oooh!
Diarrhea Dwayne
Bust your fucking head, souvenir your brain
You ain't talking about nothing
Got your girl leaving out my house, walking out of my house funny
Like her legs are telling jokes
I swear you would have thought it was like a DJ honcho
And we ain't talking slow, you just listening fast
Boy I'm sitting on green like piss in the grass
Just let me know, and the grass still grow, even if you mow
I'm so N.O
I hope I live until I'm five hundred and four
That'll be cool

[Chorus: x2]
Can I roll with you baby?
That'll, that'll be cool
Maybe with the Mercedes?
That'll, that'll be cool
With things that drive you crazy?
That'll, that'll be cool
And if you put that ice on my body?
That'll, that'll be cool

[Lil Twist]
I'm so two one four, you know Twist man
I get paper in my bag so bad like a mailman
So fresh, so dope
Head to the show
Sitting on a white and black car with Orealeo
14 is so nice, my flow is so tight
If you trying to see me leave left, go right
Me and Wayne on the same track, Ohh I just like that
With Bizzile on that Cadillacs, but as sharp as a thumb tack
I'm so Young Money, get like Twist dude
I can be a school boy and a "G" like Ice Cube
Like watching Next Friday
Move kid out of my way, it is my way, yes it is my day
Boy, look at her, It's Young Money roll
We just swerve Maserati
But a coke wadd with sizzle of those from Universal now
I ain't talking about the label
I'm in a different city but were connected like cable
Ya, we go straight, seven to sable
We put rhymes in your head, ya'll put money on the table
Weezy, thank you for blessing me "G."
Now all these girls steady asking me..

[Chorus: x2]
Can I roll with you baby?
That'll, that'll be cool
Maybe with the Mercedes?
That'll, that'll be cool
With things that drive you crazy?
That'll, that'll be cool
And if you put that ice on my body?
That'll, that'll be cool

[Lil Twist]
Now wait, let me brush off my Jordans
The ones and the now, I got them for recorded
Mr. Big Family, Young Money's on
Plus the bus is real sharp
Hey, Money's real tall
Yea that's right
Ball till' we ball
Steady grind hard
Young in the game of girls
Showing black harts and stars
The kid of the south runs things, they easy
Believe me, I'm running hard Obama to Hillary
It ain't over, got my green and celery
It's on my dice, it's on my body, young with a felony
Iced up
Wayne couldn't help but notice
He just bought a Lambo and got me a new Lotus
Rolling, straight strolling, we hold that
From (the "n" word) some of when of dat it's cold dat when it's cold that clothe that
Money on top, I ain't a Rockefeller, but I hold up the rock, and then ain't nobody going stop, me
From doing my thing in like big talk
On my body I can't catch a stain or something like that
Show some rumming[? ] cabrain[? ] the harts to ever do it
So haters step up your game for real man

[Chorus: x2]
Can I roll with you baby?
That'll, that'll be cool
Maybe with the Mercedes?
That'll, that'll be cool
With things that drive you crazy?
That'll, that'll be cool
And if you put that ice on my body?
That'll, that'll be cool</pre>
