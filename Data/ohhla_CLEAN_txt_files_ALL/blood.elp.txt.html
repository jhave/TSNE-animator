(Don't look now, we're coming..........)

I plug the ladies in
Mum kept the babies in
Do right Do right Do right Do right Do right {*3X*}

I plug the ladies in
Mum kept the babies in
Do right Do right ..... {*7X*}

I saw a dream flow slow
And saw youre haemoglobin
With jackles from every trade
With boogie faces from motors

She's walking beneath the rain
Connected by flesh extensions
While I've been through every puddle
My little walkers connected and....

I shout grate the biscuits
Grip the slip and repeat it
Baby boys in the puddle
And mothers sent us to pen again

This is the big fear
And I'm reaching up from the swamp in here
I'm taking away the trust
While the screaming can turn the a saint (?)

She wrote
Throw us out in a week
With a flash little man huddle
And infinate maternal wear
We used to sleep on cardboard

I stutter with chopped image 
Of rapping while she listens to playing
I heard of trouble funk
Wake me with a sentance

I saw you're dream flow slow
And saw you're heamoglobin
With teddy (??) cut daggers
And tusslin' with monster motors

You wouldn't stop water choking
He has that vein of magic
And I slip below the city far below the big eratic

I plug the ladies in
Mum kept the babies in
Do right.......... {*3X*}

I plug the ladies in
Mum kept the babies in
Do right Do right..... {*3X*}

When I say he I mean I
( Can prevail)
When I say you I mean we
(Will prevail)
When I say she I mean God
(Give us streangth)

Do right do right do right do right do right... {*5X*}

I saw you're dream flow slow
And saw you're haemoglobin
Wher emotions cause no emotions
A peddle door opens on
Mob smile
Dat style
The diss manoevers other little child
Look to the side lines where I shine upon mu time

The Physic declines through sharp finds and blood lines
Upon the heath the dew remains cold
Though the sun shines
The other
Speak not of it
The moon will drag the oceans tide and then my heart will split

Back hunch
Eyes well
Thoughts mutilate a slide show
The darkest thoughts were used in a row
Wher did the child go?

A kiss is floating throught the air but never landed
Will you accept all these excuses in exchange for understanding

We saw a dream flow slow
And saw you're haemoglobin
Wher our love resembles clothing
And the beats are human clothing 
And the thoughts of focus of consistence
supersidal magic
I slip beyond myself into the realms of bad magic

I plug the ladies in
Mum kept the babies in
Do Right...... {*fades out*}</pre>
