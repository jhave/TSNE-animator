Verse 1
[Kid Ice] Here we go, back to turn it out
          The nastiest niggas representin' the South
          With the freakiest bitches from the sunshine state
          Dissin' off niggas out to playa hate
          Butt-naked hoes is all we do
          'Cause no one got the freaks like the Crew
          Runnin' through the nation without a care
          Holler at your boys, 2 Live is here!
[Marquis] You're fuckin' with the best of 'em, fuck the rest of 'em
          After me there'll be no more left of 'em
          The last booty-shake gangsta
          Look at all the bread that the booty can make ya
          I got the booty doin' big thangs
          So bow down to the kings of the motherfuckin' booty-game
          Well-known worldwide,
          This is 2 Live, until the day I die!

Chorus:
(2 Live Crew) (They're back!)
(2-2 Live Crew) (Say-whut-say-whut?)
(2 Live Crew) (They're-back-they're-back!)
(2 Live Crew) (Get-loose-get-loose-now!)
(2 Live Crew) (They're-back-they're-back!)
(2-2 Live Crew) (Say whut?)
(2-2 Live Crew) (Get-loose-get-loose-now!)
(2 Live Crew) (They're back!)

Verse 2
[Kid Ice] We're Nasty As we Wanna Be
          They dropped the ban and set us free
          Lil' Joe turned us loose in the United States 
          To see how much wreck we'd create
          'Cause there ain't no party like a 2 Live Party
          'Cause a 2 Live Party don't stop!
          So come to the party and have no fear
          Holler at your boys, 2 Live is here!
[Marquis] Unknown whereabouts, somewhere smoked out
          Dickin' a bitch's mouth off in a trickin' house
          Ridin', lickin', peepin', blowin'
          Stop, pick up the bitch that's hoin', and keep goin'
          Marquis ain't gon' ever change
          I'ma stay in the street just as well as my name
          Shine like the diamond I'm named after
          When it comes to trickin' hoes, I'm a motherfuckin' master

Chorus

Verse 3
[Kid Ice] We're the first motherfuckers in the bass game
          Respect is due when you mention our name
          Representin' the South with the bottom-boy style
          Known worldwide with the Miami style
          'Cause there ain't nothin' better in any land
          Than the Brother Marquis and the Chinaman!
          Bow down to the best from far and near
          It's the Real Ones, baby, 2 Live is here!
[Marquis] Smokin' blunts by the pack, drunk off 'gnac
          Watchin' my ones stack, I got it like that
          Bitches know what's the time with me
          I fuck 'em 'till they skeet and leave they name in the street
          Brother Marquis ain't nothin' to fuck with
          So don't get mad if I fuck and I nut quick
          I'm off the chain, I'm off the key
          Uncut G, Nasty As I Wanna Be

Chorus

Clay D:
HEYY!  OWW, WORK IT! (DON'T STOP, DON'T STOP!)
PUMP IT UP, PUMP IT UP! (PUMP IT UP, GET IT UP!)
GET-GET IT, GET IT! (COME ON, COME ON!)
SHAKE, GET-GET IT! (OW, JUST WORK IT!)
WORK YO' BODY! (SHAKE IT, SHAKE IT!)
DON'T STOP, WORK IT! (DON'T, DON'T...)
OWW! PUMP IT UP, PUMP IT UP! OWW! (GET LOOSE NOW!)
A PARTY, BABY! (SAY WHAT, SAY WHAT!)
2 LIVE, BABY! (IT AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT A PARTY!)
IT'S '98! (COME ON, LET'S GET IT!)
JUST WORK IT ON, GET IT ON!
SHAKE IT ON, GET IT ON! (2 LIVE CREW!)
YO' BODY! (YOU KNOW WE GOTTA, GET LOOSE NOW!)
