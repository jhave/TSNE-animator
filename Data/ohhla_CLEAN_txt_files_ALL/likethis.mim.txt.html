[Intro]
Uh, You know what it is what it is when we do what we do

[Verse 1]
If good girls get down on the floor
Tell me how low will a bad girl go
She probably pick it up drop it down real slow
Either that or she's upside down on the pole
That's when I grab the knot throw it up in the sky
Let it come down slow watch it all fly
Front to the back then side to the side
Then we head back to my crib for the night
That's how it goes down, all night long
She whisper in my ear says she loves my song
This Is Why I'm Hot, she got it on her phone
Top ten download number one ring tone
I'm in my zone tell me what's good, what it be
Can't say I'm what you want but I got what you need
All night, it's alright
We can dance but ya gotta keep it up a lil somethin

Like this, Like this, Like this, Like this
(Girl tell me if you want it like this)

[Verse 2]
If you want to you can back it up
You say you like it rough won't you let me smack it up
Palm on your ass that's if you let me touch
I don't care 'bout your breast you can be an A cup
I know what I like, and baby that's below the waist
I'm a baller, baby I'll hold us safe
I got about ten lawyers to blow the case
So we don't gotta worry 'bout those who hate
I'm like the 2-0-0-7 Nino
Dropped a few G's on my shirt like Gino
Homey don't act like you know what I mean
Oh see I'm the freshest motherfucker on the scene though
Back of the club, all night long
Grand Monea pop a Case Of The Dom
Shorty says she love it when I let her call me Sean
So if you really down baby we can get it on

[Verse 3]
Gimme that all of that break it down
Girl shake it up now drop it to the ground
Your way too high go a little lower
Now baby beat it up like Rocky Balboa
Yeah that's what I said Shortie go 'head
Show me what you got here's a little more bread
You know how I shine a hundred on the wrist
If you like what you see then ya gotta keep it up a lil somethinn
