[Chorus: unknown singer]
It ain't my fault (let's do it, let's do it)
We had too many drinks baby (let's do it, let's do it)
Got you dancin on the bar (let's do it, let's do it)
Let's take this party to my hotel suite (let's do it, let's do it)
Yeahhhh

[Layzie Bone]
We're streamin live online for the world to see
It ain't me young G, your girl all on me
She chose me when she seen your boy buy out the bar
Told her, "Drink 'til you drop lil' superstar"
Better chill, be cool homie grab a drink
Cause you don't wanna play big bank take little bank
We at The Palms where it ain't no drama
Hugh Hef' thugged out wearin Layzie pajamas
House coat, pure silk, party hard for days
Pretty girls up in here wearin Lay-gerie
It's my brand new line, hot damn you fine
Picture perfect from behind sippin a glass of wine

[Chorus]

[Flesh-N-Bone]
I'm in the limosine bus, black tint windows
Smashin on the diesel, head-rush from the indo
Vegas - they say what goes on there stays
If you really tryin to gamble shake 'em up and roll my way
Nobody rock the way a Bone Thug show
We get it in overtime but they already know
Break out the money then we headed for the exit (exit)
Ain't no tellin what we 'bout to get next in (next in)
I'm on my tip-toes, steady I be floatin
Coastin holdin somethin that I'm sippin on slow (slow)
I ain't tryin to pass out overdosed
and fuck around wake up in the mornin naked on the flo'

[Chorus]

[Krayzie Bone]
I'm finna hit it like Kray Jackson tonight (Kray Jackson tonight)
I'm finna get it hype, Lay let me get a light
Bartender, let me get a shot of Henny, make it double
Mix a lil' Gin with it, gon' get me on the level
I see you girl, lookin at me, lookin at you
Feelin your drink, and feelin me too
It's the physical attraction baby, what can we do?
She want a little thug passion, roughness, harassment
Drink a little mo', while I drink a little Mo'
Let's get tipsy and forget where these feelings is finna go
To the room - that's where I'm tryin to guide 'em to
And yo I roll with them, but I can ride with you (with you, with you, with you)

[Chorus]

[Wish Bone]
Gucci bag full of cash, black card and all
Hood star, never gonna hate they love us, Bone's stacked
Table full of drinks from the bar, come closer
Make our way through, top shelf and we're blowin
Don't worry 'bout your business gettin out there girl
Come here, grown man, put some thug in yo' ear
You're drop-dead gorgeous, sip 'til we nauseous
And then we're gonna bounce, bounce, shake 'em
Room with a pool just one rule, get naked
Yeah you got a girl, your deadline's extended
One more drink to the face let's play
We can reminisce it over pancakes - ha ha ha!

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Women in the club, they focusin on the gentleman
(We in Vegas, we 'bout to kick it nigga)
We hit the dance floor, dance floor, dance floor

Take it to the medic, pack liquor to where we headed
You could read it right before that they set it to end the rhetoric
The veteran, the gentleman, the warrior, the better man
And Bizzy's just a thug gettin fucked up, get it?
Safe sex, never ever with the same sex (eww)
Yeah we at Vegas (hey) spend it like wild Roulette
Free drinks, hundred thousand dollar chips
Leanin back in the whip in the night-life strip

[Chorus]</pre>
