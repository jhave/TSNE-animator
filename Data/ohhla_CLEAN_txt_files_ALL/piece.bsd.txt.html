Song:   Piece of the Pie
Typed by: scott_rodkey@hotmail.com

	"Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share"
		"Taking care of business yeah without no doubt"
	"Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share"
		"And I'm a make a million dollars kid before I'm out"

[Esoteric]
Esoteric's world-class like Kerry Von Eric
Low pro the Kingpin, rap so comeric
Classic, how I rip the raps with the reference
Beating com head with a rap to my contestants
Questions, answered, shameless, expansion
I kick five lines and your headstone is planted
Frantic, knew it that the second you were greater
Battle me, lyric for lyric, I shall defeat ya
Meet ya, can't hold a candle to my ???
You organizing armies of swamies to call the dominies
Yo it's Esoteric, known as a mic expert
I bet you got my face Xeroxed on your sweatshirt
Cause I know I did, and you do what I do
There's one two many rappers out here that's acting cookoo
Riffing, grabbing a pen thinking you're different
Ayo, rappers better lay Lalo like Schifrin
If and when, time comes to send
A rapper to his grave, I do it with the soundwave

	"Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share"
		"Taking care of business yeah without no doubt"
	"Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share"
		"And I'm a make a million dollars kid before I'm out"
	"Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share"
		"I got a lot of things to do, a lot of money to make"
	"Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share"
		"I got no time for you and all the moves you fake"

[Count Bass-D]
Check it, I'm as rare as the "Life's A Bitch" twelve-inch
My life is worth about $150, too
Huh, my insurance policy is niggas watching me
Nobody gets offenses, just testing niggas in trenches
And when the beef commences, it's monsoons in trenches
Shells that propell fromy your tweeter
Y'all got 'em scared but my music's sweeter
If you running from the Feds then why you rock a beeper?
I don't own a Rolex watch yet talent is cheaper
But far more precious than the Hope Diamond, that is
Ayo I put that on my mother, my wife, and two kids
While mad rappers doing bids for pushing yeyo
Which I don't care though, when they get out you give 'em a pound
Herb like you get a share though
You let them in, control your mind like Jepetto
Roxbury, Dorchester represent, peace to Ed O.

	"Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share"
		"Taking care of business yeah without no doubt"

[Virtuoso]
Ayo Virtuoso's XXL, ripping records despite my 7L
Earn my respects so play this in clubs, to boost the record sales
It's big nigga heard I was coming in slick quicker
Than toboggans on ice tails, L's popping in your Walkman
Dropping the mic skills that hit your ear
Clearly Virtuoso's flow's tighter where yours is a slight spill
I find it quite ill that most people who think I'm cocky
Appear to be the same herb asses trying to mock me
Sick of my flows chop me, damn right you can chop this cut up
Heard you think you nice on the mic, so let's see what's up
You can't stand firm, you ran and squirmed
And if you touch the mic after ??? you get your hand burned
When I slide on beats I transform into gigantic sandworms
Crush your crain with undersound friction that makes the man burn

	"Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share"
		"Taking care of business yeah without no doubt"
	"Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share"
		"And I'm a make a million dollars kid before I'm out"
	"Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share"
		"I got a lot of things to do, a lot of money to make"
	"Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share"
		"I got no time for you and all the moves you fake" (Repeat 2x)
