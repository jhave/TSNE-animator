[Evidence]
Yo I got 24 bars to heal these scars
I'm a underground cat but still like money and cars
I'll introduce myself, check it out, ladies and gentlemen
The one and only Evidence servin' up your medicine
Varsity letterman, E on my coat
Every time I touch the paper, it's murder he wrote
I'm from a real big city called watch where you go
A place you think you know only to find out you don't
Born in L.A. it's hard to get star struck
Born in L.A. so I always keep my guard up
Born in L.A. plus still where I stay
Everyday, cats like Julio G paved the way
Me crew's thick, all sharp, take a pick
All ready to spit or sit down and write a hit
We learned both from the best on both coasts
Couldn't stress enough all the times we've killed shows
(Bounce) Problem here, problem there, got through 'em
Label here, label there, politics and bullshit
We rip, the mic's cocked back, a full clip
I don't preach I rap, I'm on stage, this ain't a pulpit
This is it, we're up and runnin', torches lit
Prepare for marathons, we don't sprint
I save my crew's name for last, injection's lethal
It's L.A.'s finest y'all, it's Dilated Peoples

[Chorus]
Y'all can't sleep now                      ("I rap caffeine")
Play for keeps, we play for keeps now      ("I rap caffeine")
Y'all can't sleep, y'all can't sleep now   ("I rap caffeine")
Play for keeps, we play for keeps now      ("I rap caffeine")

It's people you know, it's people you don't
It's people involved that shouldn't be, you gotta keep close
It's people you know, it's people you don't
It's people involved that shouldn't be, you gotta keep close

[Evidence]
I got that flow for the street
Stay ahead of the time, stay behind the beat
It's not what you know but what you can prove
Everyday they keep chasin' me down with little clues
It's Dilated, from Lost Angels
You didn't know, friends make better music than strangers
So far I've been misunderstood
Wherever I fall, I make the category look good
26 years young when I wrote this down
My whole life ahead of me, I was known in my town
Things started to change and started to stretch
The farther away I went the closer to home I started to get
(Yeah) My actions cause reaction
Some love or hate shit (I don't ask) It just happens
Either or, we came to get it started
Before the show find me at the bar drinkin' Bacardi
This is it, cats worked hard to have things
Here to keep the party up, I rap caffeine
I save my crew's name for last, injection's lethal
It's L.A.'s finest, it's Dilated Peoples

[Chorus]
Y'all can't sleep now                      ("I rap caffeine")
Play for keeps, we play for keeps now      ("I rap caffeine")
Y'all can't sleep, y'all can't sleep now   ("I rap caffeine")
Play for keeps, we play for keeps now      ("I rap caffeine")

It's people you know, it's people you don't
It's people involved that shouldn't be, you gotta keep close
It's people you know, it's people you don't
It's people involved that shouldn't be, you gotta keep close
It's people you know, it's people you don't
It's people involved that shouldn't be, you gotta keep close
It's people you know, it's people you don't
It's people involved that shouldn't be, you gotta keep close</pre>
