Intro: Lil' Cease
Uh, yeah
Uh, One-two
One-two
One-two, ya'll
Uh, Uh, yeah, Uh
Yo, yo, yo, yo

Verse One: Lil' Cease
It's Lil Cease nigga
About to blow charm like pop
In the Benz drop
I'm hot, you're not
Pedal to the floor
Four-fifth ?????
I'm the nigga you're bitch love to clock
Be the artist standing raw, gettin head in the lot
Outside of Justin's, in the parking lot
Keep the feds on the low, in the darkest spot
Like Jigga, my lifestyle is just hard to knock
A nigga with more juice than 2Pac
My crew moves spots
Three for my niggas in the yard in the box
?????????, all a nigga got
I'm a ball till I fall
Land on acres
Get this paper
Smile like Don Juan at Gators
If ya feel me on this, 
Then my words will save ya
If ya wanna talk to me, nigga talk paper
Shit, fuck em
I want potatoes, now fuck later????

Chorus: Puff Daddy
We won't stop, till you niggas come and stick me
And I don't stop, till you haters rock wit me
And I won't stop, till I'm dead here wit fifty
And we don't stop, we won't stop

And we don't stop, you know who run the city
And we don't stop, till my dogs rock for Biggie
And we don't stop, till the feds come and get me
And we won't stop, we don't stop

Verse Two: Lil' Cease
Uh, Yo, yo, yo
All a nigga need is 
One shot, one brick
Four niggas and four clips
Mo thugs and four-fifths
We car-jacked a few whips
Apartment on the hot strip
Feds come, we lose it
Pissy off of party and bullshit
Till we max out
If it's beef then act out, nigga
So fuck all ya'll cats wit ya ass out
Yappin bout ya crackhouse
Creepin on the low
C-Gutter tear his back out
I ain't scared a ya'll
Trust me, ya'll ain't ready
Ya need to bring ya bitch
Cause she more heavy than metal
My guns rock steady,
The more the merry
Niggas hall ass, break fast like Mob Berry?????
Before I land three like Dell Curry (that's real)
I'm tryin to blow like Kurtis
All that shit you doing, is makin me nervous
Nervous, join the service
That paranoid shit could hurt us
Kill us
Down at B.I.E. for B.I.
Nigga, it's reality
You wanna battle nigga, bring ya large salary
And ya whole team to tackle me, nigga
Who be the last to fuck after me
Money L, D-Rock
Niggas ain't fuckin wit me

Chorus: Puff Daddy
We won't stop, till you niggas come and stick me
And I don't stop, till you haters rock wit me
And I won't stop, till I'm dead here wit fifty
And we don't stop, we won't stop

And we don't stop, you know who run the city
And we don't stop, till my dogs rock for Biggie
And we don't stop, till the feds come and get me
And we won't stop, we don't stop

Verse Three: Lil' Cease
Yo, yo, yo
I'm a switch hits on niggas
Drop hits on niggas
Switch V's on niggas
Platinum to the quadrup on niggas
Two to the point to the five on niggas
Run hard with the wildest niggas
In a cut, can't find us niggas
Livest niggas
Ice be shinin niggas
Blindin niggas
In the four point six, reclining niggas
Bitches like "damn, I got to find this nigga"
If I give her seven digits, got to dial this nigga
And you know I'm on top, you got to watch me nigga
And my dogs shoot the ball till you foul me nigga
And when the beefs on, you gon drown, my nigga
I'm a rise for real, and wish death to the fake ones
This is for my niggas that was down since day one
That bid long,
Hang in and hang on
Hold ya head and stay strong, my niggas

Chorus: Puff Daddy
We won't stop, till you niggas come and stick me
And I don't stop, till you haters rock wit me
And I won't stop, till I'm dead here wit fifty
And we don't stop, we won't stop

And we don't stop, you know who run the city
And we don't stop, till my dogs rock for Biggie
And we don't stop, till the feds come and get me
And we won't stop, we don't stop

We won't stop, till you niggas come and stick me
And I don't stop, till you haters rock wit me
And I won't stop, till I'm dead here wit fifty
And we don't stop, we won't stop

And we don't stop, you know who run the city
And we don't stop, till my dogs rock for Biggie
And we don't stop, till the feds come and get me
And we won't stop, we don't stop</pre>
