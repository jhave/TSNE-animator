Click-click... bang
Hehehe
Yeah

[ VERSE 1: Scarface ]
I'm sick of niggas tryina shoot the big six
But when the shit jumps off the nigga plays the big bitch
And that's the problem with the nation of blacks
Too slow with your motherfuckin hands, so you grab your gats
And listen to the gangsta music
You got a Glock-10 in your lap but you're scared to use it
You's a motherfuckin stunt
Lettin all your homies know you bought another gun
Suppose they tried to pack you
Dropped your dick in the dirt, they'll know exactly how to send it at ya
Tryina work your way into the big clique
And that's the main reason young niggas die quick
Livin in this fast shit
And tryina have a bad bitch
But what you niggas know about a bank roll?
Trickin off the money you made with them stank hoes
Think about it quick
Quick, and raise up, bitch

[ DJ Domination ]
(Fuck 'em up)
Raise up, bitch
(Raise up)
(Bitch)

[ VERSE 2: Scarface ]
Now the niggas I run with are down brothers
And ready to die for a motherfucker
So when you wanna step, mate
I'ma bust you dead in yo ass with this 12-gauge
I ain't your ordinary villain
Some niggas were born dyin, I was born killin
So gather up your army, G
Cause that's what it's gonna take to stop a nigga like me
Cause I'm comin at you full force, nigga
I hope you got some real niggas on the trigger
Cause I be rollin like a hustler
And since you got gats you better use them motherfuckers
Sparkin nines at a drastic pace
Takin orders from a motherfuckin basket case
So when my nine goes pop
Boy, you better shit or get your ass up off the pot
(Fuck 'em up)
Listen to my glock click
Now raise up bitch

[ DJ Domination ]
(Fuck 'em up)
Raise up, bitch
(Raise up)
(Bitch)

[ VERSE 3: Scarface ]
So niggas don't fuck with me
Cause I'ma run the whole ninety-motherfuckin-three
And the rest of the years to come
So bitches bring it on if you motherfuckers want some
And I'ma break you off a big piece
Cause niggas can't fuck with the big chief
Attention motherfuckers, about face
Salute the one that the people call Scarface
Still quick to hit 'em up, quick to get 'em up
Quick to not give a fuck
Never bringin the false shit
I left the mic for a year and I still ain't lost it
Still runnin 'em down, gunnin 'em down
Yeah, cause real niggas gonna clown
So put your crown on since you're bigger
And let me take care of my business, nigga
The bigger the nigga, the bigger the cap
The bigger the bullet, the bigger the fuckin gat
So step up with that hoe shit
And I'ma empty the whole clip
Ain't no runnin like a rabbit
Cause I'ma let you motherfuckers have it
Let the motherfucker blast
And bring your hat to your motherfucking ass
Cause niggas ain't true to it, you're new to it
And don't know what to do to it
But I ain't never had that kind of luck
If you're scared to bite the bullet, then raise the fuck up</pre>
