[Chorus]
Shitted on 'em, man I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em
Shitted on 'em, man I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em

[Verse 1]
All these bitches is my sons
and I'ma go and get some bibs for 'em
a couple formulas, little pretty lids on 'em
If i had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em
Let me shake it off
I just signed a couple deals i might break you off
and we ain't making up I don't need a mediator
Just let them bums blow steam, radiator

[Chorus]
Shitted on 'em, man I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em
Shitted on 'em, man I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em

[Verse 2]
This stone is flawless F1
I keep shooters up top in the F1
a lot of bitches beggin' me to eff one
but I'ma eat them rap bitches when the chef come
Throw some fresh one's
more talent in my mu'fuckin left thumb
she a'int a Nicki fan then the bitch def dumb
you a'int my son you my muthafuckin step-son

[Chorus]
Shitted on 'em, man I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em
Shitted on 'em, man I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em

[Verse 3]
All these bitches is my sons
and I a'int talking 'bout Phoenix
bitch I get money so I do's what i pleases
I live where the muthafuckin pools and the trees is
broke bitches so crusty (disgust me)
gave the bitch a ride got the Continental dusty
trust me I keep a couple hundred in the duff' b
couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me (EW)
Im the terminator bitch talk slick I'ma have to terminate her
These little nappy headed hoes need a perminator
you my seed I spray you with germinator
Move back bugs matter fact you know the queen could use a back rub
If you could turn back time, Cher
You used the be here but now you gone Nair

[Chorus]

Shitted on 'em, man I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em
Shitted on 'em, man I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em</pre>
