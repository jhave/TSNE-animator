I would give my life for you
You mean the world to me
Baby Baby Baby Baby
Ooooooh!
You know that I love you
Uh-hu, yea come on
And I wanna be together
We can runway
Its NB Ridaz
Just me and you
Same click new title
Just me and you
Will you runaway with me?

(Verse 1)

The day I wrote these words for you I cried
Could of died that day
A happy and complete man
Cuz in the palm of my hands
Everything I dreamed of and more
And you know that IM down for yours forever in life
The reason why I made you my wife
Is because you see me for me
The real me
And love me unconditionally
And even with them circumstances that I had
You still gave me a chance
And that's why
I live and breathe for you and the kids and you give
Me more than this thing can ever give me
And now my life is satisfied and complete
Visions are coming true (Yea) of me and you
Placing rings on each others fingers saying "I do"
You stuck with me through my thick and my thin
To go back and live life over again (Nah)
This is my destiny
It was worth the agony to get the ecstasy

(Chorus)

We can runaway and spend some time
I'll always be the one right by your side
Tell the whole world you belong to me
You are my everything
Ooooooh
I wanna run a way with you

(Verse 2)

I never ever met a shorty that was quite like you
And even though it was wrong I fell in love with you
Now we sit here
Not really knowing what to do
But IM sure that you know I give the world for you
If I could runaway with you I wouldn't even think twice
(Uh-hu)
I promise girl I put it all on the line
I know forever seems to be a long time
But thats what I'm seeing when I look into your eyes
And it don't matter what your friends might say
Kuz I know deep inside you feel the same way
You can tell me what you want but I can read your mind
So quit lying to yourself and put your hand in mine
I get excited every time you come close
And being right here with you is what I love the most
So anytime you feeling lonely inside
We can runaway together leave this world behind

(Chorus)
    
(Verse 3)

Waking up the morning and you still not there
Can we runaway and escape somewhere
Missing your soft touch, your lips next to mine
Holding up your hands as you looked into my eyes
What must of happened to the love we both felt inside
Emotions were strong and the feeling was right
Now we don't speak any more
You went you own way
If that's what loves about then I was mislead
Go ahead and take your time if that's
What you need
My love for you is forever, my heart for you bleeds
Things happen for a reason so I ask myself
"Should I be strong and wait or move on to someone else"
I know you still love me I can feel it inside
You always kept it real, No games, No lies
If you ever feeling lonely feel the need to get away
Call me up, I'll be there together we'll runaway
(Girl)
