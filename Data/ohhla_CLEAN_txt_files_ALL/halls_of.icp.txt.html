Halls Of Illusions

[Violent J]
Ticket please, thanks, walk through the door 
Into the Halls Of Illusions, visit yours
And see what coulda and shoulda and woulda been real 
But you had to fuck up tha whole deal

"Lets take a walk down the hallway 
It's a long way it, it takes all day!" 

And when you get to tha end, you'll find a chair 
With straps and chains, we slap you in there
Lock you down tight so you can't move a thread 
And pull your eyelids up over your head
Cuz you're about to witness an illusionary dream 
It's just to bad it ain't what it seems 

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
You walk in and see two kids on the floor 
They playin Nintendo and he's got tha high score 
And sittin behind them chillin in a chair 
Is your wife, when ya look, oh, you ain't there
It's some other man in the hand in hand 
Now she looks so happy you don't understand 
See this is an illusion, it never came true
All because of you! 

[Violent J]
Back to reality and what you're about 
Your wife can't smile cuz ya knocked her teeth out 
And she can't see straight from gettin hit 
Cuz you're a fat fuckin drunk piece of shit
But it's all good here, come have a beer
I'll break the top off it and shove it in ya ear
And you're death comes wicked painful and slow 
At tha hands of MILENKO! 

[Chorus (2x)]
Great Milenko, wave your wand
Don't look now, your life is gone 
This is all because of you
What you got yourself into

[Violent J]
Look who's next it's Mr. Clark
The dirty old man from the trailer park
You got your ticket? Thanks take your coat off 
And later on, why not, I'll rip your throat off

"Lets take a walk down the hallway 
It's a long way it, it takes all day"

And when you get to the end you'll find a chair
You see all the blood, yeah your boy was just here
We get all different kind of people comin through
Richies, chickens and bitches just like you
In the Halls everybody gets a turn 
To sit and witness your illusion before you burn

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
What do we have here, oh yeah, no way 
It looks like your kids and they okay
Your daughter's chillin up in college top grade 
And your son's a fuckin doctor, phat paid
They got families and kids and it's all good 
They even coach little league in the neighborhood 
Is this true have ya really seen tha holy ghost? 
Nah, bitch, not even close! 

[Violent J]
Back to reality your son's on crack 
And your daughter's got nut stains on her back 
And they both fuckin smell like shit 
And live in the gutter and sell crack to each other
When they were kids you'd beat em and leave em home 
And even whip em with the cord on the telephone
And that reminds me man hey ya gotta call
Watch your step to Hell...it's a long fall!

[Chorus (2x)]

[Violent J]
Ah, it's time to pack up and move to the next town 
But we forgot Mr. Bigot, okay, dig it
We can't show you an illusion cuz we're all packed 
But I'll still cut ya neck out, hows that?

[Chorus (4x)]
