Song:   Marijuana Plants on Saturn
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yo I'm fallin through the ice
Yeah haha hypnotic molecules
as molly fuels these college fools
and in my brain the lava cools
and if it rains then ill be cool
like i just pulled a golden champagne bottle on some ice
Salvador Dali tools
blind lovers hard truths
blood bubble clouds in a sky
colored chartreuse
Raegen era babies slangin handmade crack
Flippin cakes writin songs
Call it pancake rap

They hate me as the pancake rapper
I made a half a million dollars bein the pancake rapper
You little pancake rappers tryin to diss me
when you've never even met me and I still give you a handshake after

I'm just movin' tryin' to squeeze a cup of juice
from out the Revolution never losin ever
Never loosen pressure, keep squeezin
Keep dreamin' the sweet sea breeze is only comin
for those drummin for those hummin without cheap reasons
The president is black, a second term, you gotta problem with it?
Fuck you, let it burn
Man someone that never grows is just someone that never learns
You shoulda dumped your blunt ashes instead you kept an urn

It's hard to earn. I'm goin' back in

Yo my wife is pregnant I got a son that's comin' soon
And I'm excited to explain the rain, the thunder and the moon
But I''m just frightened of the pain the blame the suffering the spoon
Of heroin that made dr. dre's son tumble to the tombs
So I'm guessin' the way to teach him health is life's essence
Is never make my presence be a present
And I can't be there every single second
But I'll bless him with the weaponry
to think, to guess, to search, to dream, to question everything

Question everything, question the world until you feel convinced
Question all your neighbors, if they bother you then build a fence
Question every woman, every hooker, every village wench
And if you get no answers it don't matter boy, you still the prince

And if they question you just throw an honest answer at 'em
My words are oozing with the visuals of ansel adams
I'm like a cancer atom, I'm like a marijuana plant on Saturn
As I vandalize your brain with frantic patterns
I got another factoid to spit:
Every time I see these little swag boys and shit
I find a stack of tabloids to rip
Then I kneel in my backyard PRAYIN FOR AN ASTEROID TO HIT
Just hit. Like you're Pacquiao punchin Cotto, just hit
Like you're trainin with Cus D'amato, just hit
When I adjust the motto, follow the buck that bought a bottle
Coulda fucked a model (what?)

No no no no that's wrong. You got it backwards

I'm just movin' tryin' to squeeze a cup of juice
from out the Revolution never losin ever
Never loosen pressure, keep squeezin
Keep dreamin' the sweet sea breeze is only comin
for those drummin for those hummin without cheap reasons
The president is black, a second term, you gotta problem with it?
Fuck you, let it burn
Man someone that never grows is just someone that never learns
You shoulda dumped your blunt ashes out, but instead you kept an urn

Like that

I'm gettin' money
Hey hey
We get that forty hours every week money [x4]

Y'all want a third verse?

I'm like a hominid takin psilocybin mushrooms
Creatin' language, I'm rappin' from a place of anguish
High roller, bitch! I bank roll Vegas
It's industrial poison like all the rainbow agents
This ain't homophobic man but fuck your homo prada coat
I would rather put you in a fuckin go go plata choke
I would rather be your bitch or give you the drawls
I'd rather do a song with Nicki Minaj (agggh) BARF

It's the crazy eyed killa
larry david aged scotch 85 swiller
So give these new leather shoes a spit shine for dad
Mac Lethal's back and this time he's mad

I'm just movin' tryin' to squeeze a cup of juice
from out the Revolution never losin ever
Never loosen pressure, keep squeezin
Keep dreamin' the sweet sea breeze is only comin
for those drummin for those hummin without cheap reasons
The president is black, a second term, you gotta problem with it?
Fuck you, let it burn
Man someone that never grows is just someone that never learns
You shoulda dumped your blunt ashes out, instead you kept an urn
LIKE THAT
