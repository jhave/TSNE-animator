   Universal b-boy, looking for the perfect beat
   Mortal motivations, looking for the perfect beat
   Mighty Zulu Nation, they have found the perfect beat
   Afrika Bambaataa, I present the perfect beat beat beat beat

Looking for the perfect beat (Searching for the perfect beat)
Looking for the perfect beat (Seeking for the perfect beat)
I must get mine (I'm out to get it)
I must get mine (I'm out to get it)

Now in this world of music, there are many different tones (Tell 'em)
If there's no satisfaction, just pay for some action (Listen up)
On your radio, you hear perfect beats playing (Hey)
If it makes you satisfied, just get a pony and ride! (Giddy up!)

Well if you're looking for the perfect beat, people
Well here's a perfect beat for ya
So ??? with a chorus you can sing, round up!

Looking for the perfect beat (Searching for the perfect beat)
Looking for the perfect beat (Seeking for the perfect beat)
I must get mine (I'm out to get it)
I must get mine (I'm out to get it)

      Looking for the perfect beat (Repeat 4x)

Say we like to body rock the parties
Say we like to body rock the parties

You like to body rock the parties?
We like to instant pop the parties

Students, of the music, at every single age
Must exercise the quotes of Shakespeare, with this life upon a stage
When we say life you know that's right, has a meaning
Our music does complete it
And all the things that we wanna keep teasing, teasing, teasing

Looking for the perfect beat, people
Well here's a perfect beat for ya

      Looking for the perfect beat (Repeat 4x)

Looking for the perfect beat party, the one with the top sure shot mix
Stop a futuristic hit dance, just party (Get loose, get loose)
Every time we get into it, makes us wheel and deal
Brings out the very best in us, that is for real

Now this is what you gotta do (This is what you gotta do)
This is a thing you must to, round up!

Music is a must, the rhythm moves the women
To a spacy romantic ocean that's ???
Perfer or every moment, is a space on the parade
With the psychadelic shades, make you party party, everybody

Now this is what you gotta do (This is what you gotta do)
This is a thing you must to, round up!

Mr. Biggs!     (Looking for the perfect beat)
Now Pow Wow    (Looking for the perfect beat)
The G.L.O.B.E. (Now found the perfect beat)

People of the world    (We're looking for the perfect beat)
All the boys and girls (Looking for the perfect beat)
The Soul Sonic Force   (Has found the perfect beat)

	Beat this! (Repeat 3x)

Looking for the perfect beat, people
Well here's a perfect beat for ya
Soulsonic stay aim, with a chorus you can sing, round up!

      Looking for the perfect beat (Repeat 4x)

Get up on this now, or you'll be left behind
Now say say say "Round up!" (Round up!) Say "Round up!" (Round up!)

Say "Get that beat" (Get that beat)
"That perfect beat" (That perfect beat)
"I gotta get mine"  (I gotta get mine)
"I gotta get mine"  (I gotta get mine)
"It's working"      (It's working)
"It's working"      (It's working)

Say "We like to body rock the party" (We like to body rock the party)
Say "We like to body rock the party" (We like to body rock the party)
You like to body rock the party? We like to insti pop the party

Looking, looking, looking, Soulsonic Force

We are the future, you are the past
We are your future, you are the past

	It's working (Repeat 8x)

Keep looking, searching, seeking, finding
Looking, searching, seeking, finding (Repeat 8x)

Keep looking for the perfect beat
And it'll help you reach your peak
Keep dancing to our perfect beat
And it'll help you reach your peak
Keep looking for the perfect beat
And it'll help you reach your peak
Keep dancing to our perfect beat
And it'll help you reach your peak
Keep looking for the perfect beat
And it'll help you reach your peak
Keep dancing to our perfect beat
And it'll help you reach your peak
