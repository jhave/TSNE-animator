Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways

	Project hallways, the project hallways..
	Project hallways, the project hallways..

Step in to my highrise hell
You gots to be on the up and up
Watch your back, pump your crack
but don't forget to re-up
A burner's your God and you pray to it all day
Then at night, you catch a body
But it's just the shit you got to do
Cause if you wasn't watchin, they'd catch your ass too
You gotta go all out if you want props
or you can just kill a man, and it's the same for cops
Now you want a little fame from the drug game
whether you shoot em up, or pump cracks, it's all the same
But fuck it you're in it to win it
Fat uptown, cookies in the rocks, your spot's hot
Now you're livin the life of a project sad song
Makin your loot from all the right wrongs
But that's the way it goes when you choose your path
and you might just, feel the pain of a tec 22 blast
All out war, with niggaz from the next block
You're pullin out the glock, to shut em down
Now you're Mr. Big Shot in your tribe
Niggaz know your name from Mt. Vernon, to Southside
Comin from the streets of Fright
Where the only thing you'll know is how to roll it up right
And load it up, tight, you're startin a block war
Nigga pull the trigga if you want a little more
Frank Nitty style, buckwild
Thirty-eight slugs from uptown thugs
No question, you're true to the game
since the age of a little Brand Nubian
From skelly tops to props ? and all that
Now you're puttin your block on the map
A role model to the petty drug dealers
Banana clip style, my neighborhood's buckwild
You can't forget who you came from
See you later maybe sooner in the project hallways

	Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways
	Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways
	Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggaz catchin bodies

A little hellbound nigga, shoot em up, light em up
Pull the trigger, pass the 40 in the project hallways
Runnin through the doorways, back in the days
Just a little snot nosed bastard
Always causin havoc, with a blade
But now it's a burner, used, for murder
Step a little closer and your ass is grass
You better move fast 'fore I kick that ass
Cause I'm sharp like glass, but I won't break
Walk into the project hallways is your big mistake
You little bitch ass nigga, you shoulda known better
You'll get done, did, a kid from the 'Bridge
who gets buck, and couldn't give a fuck about your daze
I'm talkin bout the project hallways

Catchin bodies in the project hallways

Project hallways, chillin in the project hallways
To survive around my way
You gotta play a knuckle game every day
Lost in the shuffle of hardrocks
and knocks on the streets of the uptown blocks
Load the glocks, who got the mox'
A little gun bangin bad-ass project thug
You're in the wrong part of town kid
Mr. Buddha on the 13th floor, gimme some more
Sess bag it up real quick kid
Tap the ? shit, the brew, pass the Phil'
What's my name?  Niggaz call me little shorty gets ill
and bag em up on the street corner
And bust em open in the project hallways

Check it out, yo
Around the way kid the sun don't shine
Phillie blunts kid I got what you want and it's time
My dialogue with the project cause motivate
Move, what?  I never lose
Freestyle project hallway style
but the shit ain't real unless you got that buddha filled
chalm, keep me goin on when I perform
Charge the brain, lick em up, that's the name of the game
So it's the move when I move little smooth
on the motherfuckin mission and I just improve
Upstairs, niggaz dyin on the 6th floor
Cause in the projects, shit is mad rough
So take a puff and relax your mind
J.V. crimes, most of the time
You might catch my crew, with a sixty-four brew
Watch your back, cause we're comin through
with a fat sack of 1-2-1 son
And the shit ain't fun, unless I get some
of the action, little shorty execute
I'm killin niggaz in the hallways
til there ain't no more left to shoot
So if you can't take the heat, stay out of the ways
Before you 'come a victim of the project hallways

	Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways
	Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways

	Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways
	Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggaz shoot em up in the project hallways</pre>
