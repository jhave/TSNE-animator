Ya cold wanna be with me

[ CHORUS ]
Hey girl, you wanna be with me?
Because I need someone to be with, someone to talk to
You cold wanna be with me
Because you need someone to be with, someone to talk to
You wanna be with me?
Because I need someone to be with, someone to talk to
You cold wanna be with me
Because you need someone to be with, someone to talk to

[ Doctor Ice ]
Because the way I live nowadays
People are different, they act real funny towards me
They say, I think, I'm nice
Why, because I'm makin records? But I'm still the same Doctor Ice
[ Educated Rapper ]
The same with me, they make me laugh
People gettin jealous (cause we be signin autographs)
I try to figure it out, no doubt
(But the way things are goin) I'm ready to jet out
[ Kangol Kid ]
Word, gettin a girl is hard, it ain't funny
Kangol don't know if she want me or my money
So I'm bein picky, cause I ain't sure
And I'm livin a life you might call insecure
[ Doctor Ice ]
I want a nice individualistic that's not materialistic
Not bein egotistic, ???I decide consentualistic???
The body artistic, a little bit of lipstick
Those the type of girls that make the Doc lovesick
[ Kangol Kid ]
Well, I'm definitely a lover, hard when I'm undercover
I'll do kinky things to you if you swear not to tell your mother
I'll push, but I won't shove ya, as long as I'm above ya
When I leave just promise me, "Kangol ???? I love ya"
[ Educated Rapper ]
I want a girl with action, 'control' like Janet Jackson
I hate the dark, I'm on the light so I can see reaction
Against all relaxin, prepare for steady waxin
When you leave you must pay E - for what? - satisfaction

[ CHORUS ]

[ Doctor Ice ]
Tired of these girls tryin to play the role
Everytime I see em, they're on a stroll
Teasin the fellas, wearin tight pants
Leadin us on after a slow dance
But in search of love that's how I'm livin
I want a girl to give me the same thing that I am givin
To her, from now till the day I depart
But she's got to be a redbone, a beautiful work of art
That is the way this pisces views
Like Gigi Williams on the Eye-Witness News
I hate a girl that knows every guy
Before you introduce, he already says hi
I feel like punchin her dead in the grill
But that's ill, so Doc just chills
Cause if it's meant to happen, that's how it'll be
Sooner or later you'll cold be with me
[ Educated Rapper ]
She wants to be with me and I know this for sure
I can tell as soon as she walks through the door
Swings and sways and shakes her stuff like Jello
Waitin for EMD to say hello
Skin-tight clothing with everything left hangin
And all the boys admit that she's well worth bangin
She only talks the talk, never walks the walk
She must be the most ???? up in all New York
Acts like an angel, pretends that she's a saint
A least that's the pretty picture she would love to paint
She's extraordinary, definitely rare
And anyway you want me, baby, I'll be there
I make you feel ??protect??, fill you with bliss
??Send a chill up?? your body with just one kiss
But if you don't show, I won't be stunned
Give your mother my number, I know she'll come

[ CHORUS ]

[ Kangol Kid ]
I want a girl that'll turn me on
When I say 'go', I wanna hear her say 'gone'
When I say 'leave', I wanna hear her say 'left'
And if I say 'was it good', she better say 'def'
Cause that's the kinda girl that I am lookin for
I really don't think there are anymore
But if one appears one day
I walk up to her and gently say
[ *starts singing* ]
I've been starin at you a while
And everytime you see me starin you crack a smile
You cold wanna be with me, it's true
If you didn't, I wouldn't be next to you
So please stop perpetrating
Girl, I'm tired of waiting
For you to hurry up and make your so-called move
That you been talkin about makin, girl, show and prove
There's really no need to talk about it
You know what I want, so what about it?
We can either go fast or slow
Cause I'll be in and out before you know
You say you're resisting
But yet you're still kissing
Everybody know that I been wantin you to kiss
Hey girl, here's a spot you missed

So cold</pre>
