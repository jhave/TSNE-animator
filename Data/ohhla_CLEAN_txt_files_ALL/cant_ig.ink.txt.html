Song:   Can't Ignore Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
You could try hard, but you can't ignore me
Shout out to the ones who did it way before me
They love and they hate and then they love you more

[Verse 1]
Yeah, uh
Different day, same old story
Got money on my mind, nothing more important
My asset of a kid raised in apartments
Fuck forty in the mue, I need a bigger portion
Parked in front of a crib, looking for some dry
Dealing with the bullshit on the other side
Of the grass in the pass, I would run and hide
But I can't kill any time, it's career homicide
Uh, Gotta show 'em all who the best
In the motherfucking building like an architect
Doing the most, I could never give em' less
Now take a look around, I be here when no one left
Bitch, I promise

[Chorus]
You could try hard, but you can't ignore me
Shout out to the ones who did it way before me
They love and they hate and then they love you more
That's the way it goes, that's the way it goes [2x]
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it goes
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it goes
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it goes
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it...

[Verse 2]
Goes! On the side where I came from
Live by the gun, die by 21
Thank God I'm alive and I made sum'
Out of nothing, niggas thought I was frontin'
Now they see me getting to it, doing what they said I wasn't
Gotta have a little patience, baby, why the hell you rushing?
I gotta play my cards, even when they think I'm bluffing
Heading to the top, can't see nobody above me
Can you feel the pressure, can you hear the message?
I'm trying to stay clean but the shit be getting messy
If you're looking for me I will be right where you left me
Put that on my city, that I'm bout' to bring it back
Bitch I promise

[Chorus]
You could try hard, but you can't ignore me
Shout out to the ones who did it way before me
They love and they hate and then they love you more
That's the way it goes, that's the way it goes [2x]
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it goes
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it goes
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it goes
Uh, yeah, that's just the way it...</pre>
