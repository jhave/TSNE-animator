I'm in trouble oops I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble oops I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble [x2]

Listen yeah I was at this club one time with a couple of mates we was
Moving to the music we was busting some shapes
I said I wanted a fag but they was loving the base, so I headed to the
Smoking bit to puff it and wait
And then this kiddie obvious he had something to say started moving to me trying
to get all up in my face, then his friends intervened yeah then you called
Him a mug, I didn't have a clue and then they started punching away I thought oh well

A Wiseman said to me the recipe for life is to conserve your energy unless
You feel it's right, don't dance with the devil unless he's in your mind
Take hold of the rebel an take this fight outside
I thought damn this puts me in a difficult position three against one but
Then my mates came in my vision, pull me back and then it became the obvious
Decision and it's funny how these idiots are acting kind of different, like
Naa brother you were given it the big un' all of a sudden someone called Chief Wiggum
And now to the custody centre I'm being driven you only have
To do a crime to be here and I didn't, police are so bad it's kinda gotten old
Like respect wasn't an order they was told, and when the blues act jazzy
I wanna slap then to the floor like "yeah bitch that's what I call rock and a roll"

A Wiseman said to me the recipe for life is to conserve your energy unless
You feel it's right, don't dance with the devil unless he's in your mind
Take hold of the rebel an take this fight outside

Maybe I do maybe I don't
Maybe I do maybe I don't
I'm in trouble oops I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble (everything was goin well and now)
I'm in trouble up I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble (can somebody explain just how)
I'm in trouble oops I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble (I just lost my head and I found)
I'm in trouble oops I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble

A Wiseman said to me the recipe for life is to conserve your energy unless
You feel it's right, don't dance with the devil unless he's in your mind
Take hold of the rebel an take this fight outside. (take it outside)

I'm in trouble oops I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble (oops I'm in trouble yeah)
I'm in trouble oops I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble (oops I'm in trouble)
I'm in trouble oops I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble (yeah)
I'm in trouble oops I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble (again)</pre>
