[Mannie Fresh]
Drivin in a Benz, in the nest
Coming in this motherfucker, turning motherfuckin necks
Going back in the superstretch
Just checkin how many fly bitches I can catch
Ride motherfucker and you gonna know
Seeing some ladies hanging out the window
Let the interior look reign
18 inches whippers look like so much pain
I'ma mac like Moley the one and only
I'm a fuck like daddy look pretty like Tony
See a hoe, bitch, shit
You gotta stop on the corner when you see a state cop
For the niggas in the night they call drag, I'ma fool and be cool
With an automatic click clack
I wanna fuck and how to fuck you bigger
Mama gonna dress and you all be better
In the middle of the night it's on
It's hot call Frank and meet you at the spot
Cash Money rules every thing around
If you represent U.P.T. your downtown

[Baby]
Bitch I thought knew they call me Baby
Hoes drive me crazy
Money is a must, coats slanging
Plus I never duck when niggas bust in cars
I mini Benz, expeditions and other cars
I look so pretty, and I'd fuck these hoes
On the grill with a mouth full of gold
Bitches know, I'll let cha know on tape enough shit
Those lamborgini niggas know shit
And I love these hoes that suck dick
Big Tymers for life enough g's on my rolex
From acorn the magazine
And she was seen homie giving brains behind it homie
It's was nice with the ice, they call me Baby
These bitches know my game is tight

[Larell]
Who can file for most of the squash
Blast through the door and get your ass tossed
Every nigga on the map on acasion lose every nigga in them hallways
Nuthin but truth is behind the peace treaty is the best decision
Cuz you don't want them to hit cha bitcha
Me in the coop, ya'll in the hall
Ya'll on the crawl so I gots to ball
I'm in the yearbook
When I was at booker t party of the year 1993
My satisfaction is, I've never been a problem
See my advirsaries were suspended and I hide em
When I'm stuck in the club niggas will let you know
On the door start looking for sure
And if you want to start something
With my kliq it's cool cuz chop off all your dicks
Uptown baby the Big Tymers know where I live
The third door from the hum drums
Your dumb if want some rowdy boy we'll some
You won't see us in the tinted old car
Won'tcha ass be all fallin behind
But you got luck thats why you got behind
Time is running out for you fools
Chickens I was at your girls house with the lights out
And slash your fuckin leather
Get a seperate shit better, whether
Win, lose, or draw, still losing my clip
Cuz uptown for life is the motherfuckin shit

[Lil Wayne]
I'm the little one with the skrilla thats off the rilla
Cuz killas get punked on the start of pilas
Nigga it's me Hot Boy show
Head tilted to the right, I'll be right next store
Nigga you know me from the true store
I die slow cuz the bullets, are old
Niggas fall to the floor, ain't a slug to touch
Too bad little nigga say what
Your pants sagin and your head busts like a skittle
I'm on fire so they tried to chill it
Tell em dogg, ain't nothin gonna shake
Creep like a slave and take all the bait
Like a tape, I still rock the mack 10
110 bullets twirl like a whirlwind
I tie up your boy and rape your girlfriend
Come off the sex with the choppers twirlin in the wind
Better watch your children, are they all in?
I shoot twice, your crawling and I get disgusting
The beef get ugly, start busting going uhhh, up in
Jesus please come see us in the speeder
I jump out with gun in the freezer
Plus your boys won't go
They must of heard of Big Tymers, act like you know
Huh huh wha wha nigga</pre>
