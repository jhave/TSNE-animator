"And the Rockets in the penalty, and that's one of the things we talked about
 earlier. For a guy who you can see now is one of the greatest stars of the 
 league, he is such a team first player, and such an unselfish player."

"When you say that this guy is averaging right at 27 points a game. And then you
 say that he's doing it in rebounding, and then also in assists. He's shooting
 48% from the field, but in shot attempts he's under 18 a game. So he maximizes 
 so that all of the rest of the guys who are playing with him are happy. Because 
 he's not shooting a low percentage, he's not hogging the ball, he's not 
 breaking the patterns, he's staying within everything that we're doing."

[Kool Keith]
I'm that busy Globetrotter, watch you turds skitty-scatter
Do one titty matter? Your girl's an overweight mammal
I work up court, y'all can D up on my handle
I pee on your spot, take your startin slot
Slam my cock in your jaw 'til your bracelets and arms rot
I will jerk off if her booty stink, cause my palm is hot
The crowd watch me jump up and touch the 24 second clock
You ain't no threat, youse a lucky come-up
With a histerectomy from the second block
Your wife smokin lookin for a second rock
Nuts filled up to the top, you remember choc'
Across the street from Donut King, maneuver with donut swing

[Keith - voice lowered]
Man you better leave basketball alone and take your panties home
Man you better leave basketball alone and take your panties home
Ask Paul Silas, the coach of Anthony and Jerome
My pee stick to the floor I will block your baseline
Your inbound lay-up no matter how much coke you put up your ass
Even with a bunch of kids around you behind you you still can't stay up
Come on faggot, take out your Tampax and crush your heart bra
and set a new play up; man to man defense
You move in a female sequence
The type that's comin out of your jeans to make cameltoes
or throw up prints, I'm too dominatin
Down low I kick the dirtiest things on hot rinse
Make sure your buttcrack deal with the nail and hammer penetration
I leave you backed up with rap constipation
Everybody SCARED to move they bowels
Get Haterade and I do suggest you use your towels
Man you better leave basketball alone, and take your panties home
Man you better leave basketball alone
and go home and take your panties home

[Kool Keith]
I'll be at the All-Star practice with turds on top of your chick's mattress
Full speed, doo-doo mode~!
Y'all ain't the big dogs, full stretched out
You right and curly walkin around in poodle mode
Tractor trailer back up y'all pick up a giant, DOO-DOO LOAD
Truck stop Flying J-er
Season tickets man you can't sit next to me the Mayor
You gas abuser, you need a PT Cruiser
Dance around the keyboards like the great Bob Moog-ah

[voice lowered]
Man, you better leave basketball alone and take your panties home
Man, you better leave, basketball alone, and take yo' panties home
