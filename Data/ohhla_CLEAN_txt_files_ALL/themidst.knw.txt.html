[Chorus: Knowdaverbs]

We're Iguanas in the midst just, just about the Father's business
From the ashes into the trenches
We move from plateau to the next
From the P.H.O.E.N.I.X

[Verse 1 &amp; 2: Soul Snatchas]

Yo! Seven X-Sinner Iguanas in the midst flesh issues
And set this spiritual death wish. Forget this
One of us goin' die
Resist the devil he flees, God draws nigh
I'm ready for war official nasty shut em down
Flesh no more, Christ. Sunrise, sundown
What now? I move with a swiftness
Leavin Satan giftless like Muslim on Christmas, forget this


In the distance you can barely see the glare from the iguanas
Phlipsyde-the word tech the wrong move you're a gonna
You can check my persona, reptiles from Arizona
Peep the word on my tongue hoe it snatches-creeps up on ya
We in your midst, you one of this, spiritual bliss (?)
Bangin' with this, it's Jesus Christ till I R.I.P
It's only right, I gotta fight
You meet me by the seventh trench, seven p.m. at night

[Verse 3: 1/2 Breed]

Evil's been around since at first days begun
I can't change the style of life but I can change the life of some
You can receive my words maybe or maybe not
It's getting dark and hell is hot
You took the words right out of my thoughts
Where I'm at hot breezes blow freely Phoenix is where I chill
Rock this beat wet and send Hot back to Nashville
To my boy Knowdaverbs whose style will make you holler
Together with Holy intellect that's why we known as scholars

[Chorus]

[Verse 4 &amp; 5: Advocates]

Iguanas in the midst with Jesus Christ we represent
Advocates and Knowdaverbs the Factors of the Seven
Keep it tight, bring light, and shine on anointed tracks
Take it to the world, come again and bring it back
To a time of life when I was dwellin' in the midst
I had to seek the kingdom and execute the Devil's tricks
I'm never lookin' back but all the while feelin' lonely like
a king to his throne
Lord father take me home


In a darker realm I slept for days I wept
for my Lord to open my gates and my soul he kept
'Cause I was null and void in the pathway of righteous
Screamin' sinners prayers hopin' one steady might just
Live true my inner spirit nearly dead
Spirit food consistency nearly water and bread
then a turnaround B thunderbolts did deliver
grains of sand in my life turned into a roaring river

[Chorus]

[Verse 6: Knowdaverbs]

Temporarily Nashvillian, Permanently Phoenician
Staying prepared to move inside and out of season
Hailing from the dust off of 43rd and Thomas
shipped in shape like a rhombus. Choke the curse and pulled the promise
But Yo! There came a time where I finally recognized
that what God wanted to do that an enemy despised
And as long as he could keep me from a true experience and never ready
He could either steal, kill, or behead me
Tried to hit me with his best shot but not
Somehow avoided being stopped so begun like a Gloc
To be about my Daddy's beeswax, rode the land on camelbacks
I-I had to double check, minimize me so he could max-
imize the plan, like a lamp take a stand
as I study God's hand as it combs through the sand
And recognize his voice when he speaks in the wilderness
Trekking through the dunes not to deviate off the Syllabus
With my ears open widely slow to speak swift to listen
Had to rid me of myself and not to messy up the mission
The temperature raisin' in the arid zone
to disintegrate the trash that wasn't in its purest form
When in the midst continue praisin' as his prescence seems nearer
Six Iguanas in the flesh exalting the seventh figure</pre>
