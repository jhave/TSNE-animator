[Chorus](Slug)
You don't know me but you'd like to
Why'd you think I stood beside you?
Not concerned with how this might fall
Nature become prowl at nightfall

(Grouch)
When the sun begins to dim
And eventually the day dies
And the mood prepares to sway
That's where another way lies
Glow of the liquor store lights
Set the scene for no rights
Let's convene, discuss the scheme
And hope it flows how we dream
Tonight can make or break you if you let it
Someone set it out for you to let it out
Now don't regret it
Get embedded to the back drop
Positioned there with your cash crop
Envision night as the last stop
Don't miss the train
It's time to gain, strain, aim, fire
Blame, reign, fuck and then retire
I'm liar past eleven, after one I'm on the run
Till the sun comes up tomorrow
I'm working, you're having fun
Not too devious, but that's me
Spontaneous if you ask me
But then again, I'm blending in.

(Sunspot)
Step to the beat, walk to the beat
Talk to the beat, live to the beat
Rock to the beat, fuck to the beat
Dance to the beat, pay to the beat
Fight to the beat, you get l-l-lost to the beat
Police walk the beat, kill to the beat
Steel to the heat, terrorize kill no retreat
Prowl to the beat, how did a V-O weak scandal oh spray vandal
Walk the streets I hear footsteps on the streets
Someone's following me on the streets
Like racism on the streets
Can't even have a new car on the streets
Police prowl on the streets
They got you sittin' on the streets
Runnin' ya L's, what in the hell?
Runnin' on tell, they see a black man they get scared as hell
Like did somebody escape from jail
You feel em' prowlin' when you walkin'
Some rooms when you walk in like boom
I wanna just break shit, I wanna re-create shit
I wanna take shit you say and use it against you
Act a damn fool like crackheads do
Like your mama do

[Chorus](Slug)
You don't know me but you'd like to
Why'd you think I stood beside you?
Not concerned with how this might fall
Nature become prowl at nightfall

(Slug)
Dusk, thus the beginning is on until dawn
Trust regardless of the daily
Really nothings wrong
I'm still breathin' and here's another evening
From the fortress
I leave for my course of tonight's achievements
There's no grievance in my pocket
Just a couple of dollars, a pen and hopefully my wallet
Because my man over here has got the hook up at the front door
Long as my ID's right what more could they want for?
Yeah we in there
Like fluoride, off the wall on the left side
A room full of pride, I'm consumed by the tune applied
This fuckin' DJ is tight man
I can already feel the minutes being added to my life span
MC Lyte paper thin drink tickets from the staff
Now it's time to make a friend and see if I can make her laugh
Hey princess, I got a lot of dialog
So I'm gonna line it up for you to get high and try to follow
Light up another false sense of security
Play a game of twenty questions
You can test my purity
And as the world comes down on me
And as I go down on her night prowler

(PSC)
I'm out when the freaks come out
Way after dusk
After the time when the opening acts get they time to bust
The nightshift I prowl and observe like the owl
Surroundings minus the scowl
Wise and well endowed
In the mental! Well renowned
Ghetto pass every town
PSC! Nice 2 meet you, oh you know about this wow!
Your ex-boyfriend showed you all about this how?
Can I thank him for training such a beauty
It fits my style
Compliments exchanged
Plus 5 dollars change
Signed my name on the poster
And I kept it in the holster like I'm supposed ta
Now, what would you do in the clutch
If you get a pussy hug after dusk?

[Chorus](Slug)
You don't know me but you'd like to
Why'd you think I stood beside you?
Not concerned with how this might fall
Nature become prowl at nightfall</pre>
