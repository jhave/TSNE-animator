[Intro: Lloyd Banks]
New York City stand up!!! The punchline kid is back!!!
Blue Heffner AKA Gang Green AKA New Diamonds AKA Lloyd Banks!!!
And I'm here with my motherfuckin homey Kayslay The Drama King!!!
Gang Green season begins, now!!!
Nah, nah I don't do all that talkin man
It's, It's one way or the other
Your comin or your gonna watch another bitch leave with me
You know that's, the way the shit go, heh heh
I'm a fuckin rap star, heh heh

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Fresh off the plane I jets off in the range
First class seats but the sweats costin the same
The rap game will bring stress, fortune and fame
And slow drive by's like when they aired out Kane
I'm like a S55 little clear out chain
They body me they body you and they will be out prayin
My only wish to find you, catch you, lay yo' ass in a stretcher
Bet ya, get ya, ass out the hood
All I got is rap, for that, I spazz out for good
That's my income, it keeps me in pads in Hollywood
I'm hardly home, when I leave the club the party gone
And I'm pissy of the Petrom tryin to get ma home
My name Banks baby, I'm top rank lady
I gotta go grab ya coat bitch you ain't crazy
I skeet off damn near rushin and bend her over somethin
And I'm pumpin, the volumes to the max and I'm frontin
All of a sudden she come down on the humble for a feel
And I'm driftin in alot of lanes fumblin the wheel
A couple of miles later I'll be comin on a grill
Then it's back to the hotel to chill, ma I give you the rush

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Damn ma, your little outfit got my third head high, and I need you to understand
I ain't really got alot of time, bitch you out ya mind
It's me, damn love, don't you wanna get up out the handcuffs
I ain't 'gon love you like your man does
I ain't really got alot of time, bitch you out ya mind

[Outro: DJ KaySlay]
