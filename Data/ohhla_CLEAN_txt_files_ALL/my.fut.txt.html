Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Super future
Yea
Ay we'll never be global nigga

[Chorus]
My wrist on the 40's
Fresh as Michael jordans
My car ain't even dropped yet
Already done ordered it
Came across a fortune
Now I got endorsements
You wanna see a movie
You can press record it
My place is enormous
And my girl is gorgeous
Hit it wit the fork yeah?
Pull up in a porshe
My chain is a stop light
And I'm sittin on forges
Trickin ain't a habit
If you can afford it

[Verse 1]
My shoe game is 1000
What the fuck you doin
Hit it with the sb
Ain't no way you losin
Codeine in my Styrofoam
Leanin like a motorcycle
Order me a Bentley
And its comin wit the
Dolce and gabana
Her man in dior
I'm dressed so exclusive
This not in your stores
Fresh as Michael Jordan
I think I can fly now
Drankin me some dirty
Have you checked my background
Audimar for [?]
Presidential rolley
I might wear that [?]
And its fully loaded
My bank roll a building
Up there wit the millions
I'm not your average star
I'm no registered villain

[Chorus]
My wrist on the 40's
Fresh as Michael jordans
My car ain't even dropped yet
Already done ordered it
Came across a fortune
Now I got endorsements
You wanna see a movie
You can press record it
My place is enormous
And my girl is gorgeous
Hit it wit the fork yeah?
Pull up in a porshe
My chain is a stop light
And I'm sittin on forges
Trickin ain't a habit
If you can afford it

[Verse 2]
My vvs my necklace
Glistenin like some cyrstals
I got on my jewelry
Think I ain't got that pistol
Pocket full of franklins
Stuffed in my Versace's
Lean inside my cup
And I put ice inside my watches
Ordered up that new coupe
I just left the dealer
Ballin like I super hoop
Michael Jordan my nigga
Espn and showtime
Wanna see my highlights
Future is a rock star
And I live that high life
Bottles in my section
Didn't u seen them sparkles
Shawty in deception
Ain't that girl a model
Splurging is a habit
Money not a problem
Yes I am a rich nigga
Came straight from the bottom

[Chorus]
My wrist on the 40's
Fresh as Michael jordans
My car ain't even dropped yet
Already done ordered it
Came across a fortune
Now I got endorsements
You wanna see a movie
You can press record it
My place is enormous
And my girl is gorgeous
Hit it wit the fork yeah
Pull up in a porshe
My chain is a stop light
And I'm sittin on forges
Trickin ain't a habit
If you can afford it</pre>
