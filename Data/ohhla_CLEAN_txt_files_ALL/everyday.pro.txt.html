[Dogmatic]
Doo, doo, day

Yo, It's like I do this shit everyday nigga
It ain't no thing to me
We will buss yo' ass, Promatic style
Everyday, all day, Sicknotes

(Doo, doo)

[Dogmatic]
It makes no difference
What position you put this mic in
Kevin still rippin', it's like
Black folk and chicken, corn bread, mac 'n chesse
Bigg Proof, Dogmatic 17 pimpin' we's
We will make you sneeze (Awchoo)
You hoes on yo' knee
Caps, Im like a dope-fien that relapse
So, Im 'a continue to buss caps
Got 10 different murders on 10 different maps
Man, these niggas that rap know the hapse
When I brandish this thang in your face then perhapse
Your mind will be changed
One way, or another
It decides to do right or get blown on your brother
So dog' call your mother!
Tell her this news
It's Bigg Proof and who?
You know how we do, everyday (hahaha)

[Chorus]
(It's like zipahdee-dipahdee-doo, do-da-day)
Everyday
(We be hittin' these licks on you, everyday)
You know how we play
(It's like zipahdee-dipahdee-doo, do-da-day)
Everyday
(We be hittin' these licks on you, everyday)
You know how we play
(It's like zipahdee-dipahdee-doo)
Who?

[Proof]
Power robber double-oh father
Fatherin' arthur of not to bother
With niggas thats harder
Promatic is not 'a iminue spin off
We break women and men off
The City of Boom is really the news
Shit, now stick to yo' truths
Sick of these fools
Actin' like we ain't got stress to tell off
And like ? pockets he's deep
And he can pay his bail off
I'ma hit my lick, bit by bit
Kick my shit, 'til a motherfucker wig get split
Everybody actin' like this game is so damn good
No man could, understand my pain
Wondering in rain
Where entrence you beg a difference
Of these locals think I made it
Blink got faded (faded) these gangs think I hate it
What matters to Matic
Matics matter to Proof
We only trying to grab it this loose shit
And thats the truth
The C.E.O's (hahaha) don't wanna see me grow
But now 'a hungry mothafucka' now so, FEED ME DOW!
Everyday

[Chorus]

[Dogmatic]
I'm like Lector Hannibal cannibal mannibal
Here to do damage to a Promatic attitude
Nah, I ain't mad at you
I'm just a battle dude (gunshots)

[Proof]
Blast at you
You Bin Laden shit we been rappin'
Here fill out this application for some chin smackin'
We been packin'
You don't wanna see pimp in action
Doip, doip, on your throat watchin' your neck snap in half
Like some E tabs

[Dogmatic]
Ill's with no rehab
God gift of ?
Smack the shit outta' 6 rappers off E fast
Smash out E-class
Detroit's that new shit (YOU'RE STUPID!)

[Proof]
We're not on your block
Hot on them billboard charts
You feel our hop, Proof and Dog im 'a tick
Get off our dick
And pick up your face
While you watch us floss whips (whips)
Who's packin' gats for us
Bag a rack and just
By acts after us, do gats have to buss (gunshot) (haha)

[Chorus]

(Doo, doo, day)
Everyday
(Doo, doo, day)
You know how we play
(Doo, doo, day)
Everyday
(Doo, doo, day)
You know how we play
(Doo, doo, (who?) day, doo, doo)</pre>
