Song:   Welcome to the East
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[repeat 4X in background]
"When the East in the house - oh my God"

[Wyclef Jean] + (Sizzla)
Yeah~! This one's for the world right here
Sizzla! (Mr. Kalonji just walked in the buildin)
Big up to the far East rulers

[Intro: Wyclef Jean] + (Sizzla)
Welcome to the East! "Oh my God"
"When the East is in the house" sometimes I ask myself
will the violence ever cease "Oh my God"
(You know you gon' like it; Kalonji, Wyclef)
It's too hot on the floor man "Oh my God"
It's too hot on the floor man
It's too hot on the floor man "Oh my God"
It's too hot on the floor
They got the M-15's "Oh my God"
We got the M-16's "Oh my God" (that's dangerous)
It's too hot on the floor man
It's too hot on the floor

[Verse One: Wyclef Jean]
Check it out
I saw the ski-mask I didn't see the faces yo
Saw the grenade, heard the explosions yo
It get worse yo, I can't count the hearses
that come out to masses, to churches, the verse is
Do unto others as you would have done unto you
Well welcome to the devil's penthouse, overlookin hell's view
David slew the philistines with a donkey jawbone
The same jawbone, I used to make microphone
The same microphone I use in New Jerusalem
To tell E.T. MC's they gotta phone home
Girl I see you in the club but your eyes full of pain
Your man a wifebeater, find a new man
And for my little sisters in the misery
Sweet sixteen you ain't alone in the pregnancy
I pour some liquors for my homies that passed
Sit back while I'm writin watch you fade in the paragraph...

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Welcome to the East! "Oh my God"
"When the East is in the house" sometimes I ask myself
will the violence ever cease "Oh my God"
Deejay turn it up~!
It's too hot on the floor man "Oh my God"
It's too hot on the floor man
It's too hot on the floor man "Oh my God"
It's too hot on the floor
They got the M-15's "Oh my God"
We got the M-16's "Oh my God"
It's too hot on the floor man
It's too hot on the floor

[Wyclef] Sizzla, check it out!

[Verse Two: Sizzla - best guess only]
All things she plant the explosives with fuel in line
We pe dimed, that's too much screwin time
Cuttin you off, the halls reach the governor
With pass enough plastic and the found for substance
I prophecy they gon' call on the attack
Must I see there and keeping this a back
Each can play guitar, cause those bands a saluting
Everyday someone forments these driveby shootings
WILL THERE EVER BE PEACE on the Earth
With human acts we shall not have peace on the Earth
Be good leave it up for firm and just
What's going on in neighborhoods today is not respected

[Chorus] with ad libs

[Verse Three: Wyclef Jean]
Dance, she's in the city of Gods
Dancin the Capoeira
I see her in Brazil, eyy!
Her cry, sound like 7 million violins
Knowin that her man
Won't be back tomorrow, she cries

[Chorus] (without Jeru the Damaja samples + ad libs)

[Outro: Wyclef Jean]
Yeah, this where we all meet right here
One mind one soul one heart
On violins we got, the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan, yeah
On guitar, my man David Rosen
Jerry Wonder on the bass
Sizzla, breddern for life
Charles the conductor I see you
Wyclef Jean</pre>
