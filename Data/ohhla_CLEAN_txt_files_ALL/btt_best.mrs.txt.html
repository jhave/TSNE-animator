[Intro] [Murs talking]
We on? I still ain't got no Twix. Candy.
"I can't help myself"
Man, that would be the best.

[Verse One]
My name is M-U-R-S 
Hailing from the far west 
Killafornia, California, L.A. Ahhh Yes 
You may have heard of us 
We all ain't murderers 
Drive by shooters
You can kick it on the curb with us 
We got blue skies 
We got palm trees 
We got boulevards 
Beaches with a calm breeze 
As far as MCs 
I'm the best of 'em 
Only five nine 
Its above all the rest of 'em 
I mean we got Dogg and we got Cube
Everybody with this blue and the red feud 
Man these dudes always trying to kill somethin'
I'm putting words together hopin' that you feel somethin'
Tryin' to put that pride back into the black music 
You can clap to it in your Lac or your Buick (do it) 
I had to do it cause nobody else can 
Couldn't beat anybody other than myself man 

[Chorus] [x2]
The best to ever do it 
The best that ever did it 
Murs is better than your favorite rapper, admit it 
Better than your best 
Y'all best to forget it 
Murs is better than your favorite rapper admit it 

[Verse Two]
Look
I'm shaking babies 
And I'm kissing hands 
Jumpin' in the crowd going crazy with my fans 
I stand alone
Don't need anyone 
But it takes two so I'm going home with anyone 
And y'all ladies that's looking like Christina 
Milian or Ricci I could really take either 
Blond girls, black girls, Asian girls, whatever 
I never met a girl that I didn't like ever 
Double negative 
That means I'm positively 
The best rapper that you ever heard obviously 
Never heard of me you didn't listen hard enough 
Been moving weight on your block like a garbage truck 
No trash rap 
I'm moving past that 
I won't crack rap just to get the ASCAP
I feel a change comin' 
I got the game runnin'
Back to the lab now they all trying to say somethin'

[Chorus] [x2]

[Verse Three]
I write songs 
Y'all write 16s 
Need to grow up, stop playin' with them kid's things 
You gotta a permit 
A license to kill 
Was making y'all money when I didn't have a deal (for real)
In on the real 
Still workin' for the white man 
Even if you is moving that white, man 
Ayyyyyyye
Y'all rhyme the same word 
No matter what you say man its just absurd 
Ohhhhhh
And I never been served 
Not in the drive thru
Not even on the curb (Hell naw) 
Not a warrant, not even a subpoena 
Not even peanuts in a sold out arena 
That's why you salty
The fans exalt me 
Why you over yonder throwin' hate trying to halt me 
Man I won't stop, my grind won't pause 
I'm moving positive circles like a round of applause 

[Chorus] [x2]

[Outro]
Thank you for all for comin' out. I liked to thank Nottz
I'd like to thank Vic for stayin' up late
I'd like to thank my bad ass god daughters for gettin' on my nerve all damn day
And me still comin' to work and doin' my job which is to be, the best
The bestest. That's a word, cause I said so. Thank you very much</pre>
