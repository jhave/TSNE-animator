Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes

[Kanye West]
Yes I did!
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin show you how we lived
E'rybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mm-hmm~! That's that shit
So if you're gon' do it, do it just like this

Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes

[Kanye West]
You don't see just how wild the crowd is
You don't see just how fly my style is
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin we was from the projects
But everytime I wanted layaway or a deposit
My dad would say, when you see clothes close your eyelids
We was sorta like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin 'bout the rich ones
Cause every summer, he'd get some
brand new hairbrained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school with a new wardrobe
And ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy...

[Kanye West]
I think he did
When he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin show you how we lived
E'rything I wanted man it seemed so serious
Mm-hmm~! That's that shit
So if you're gon' do it, do it just like this

When it feel like living's harder than dyin
For me, giving up's way harder than tryin
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin
Cause who the kids gon' listen to
HA~?! I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keepin kids in the school
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pledge, at least for the principal
They got the CD then got to see me
Drop gems, like I dropped out of P.E.
They used to feel invisible
Now they now they invincible
Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy

This is the story of a champion
Runners on the mark and you pop the gun
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be #1
Tell me what it takes to be #1
This is the story of a champion
Runners on the mark and you pop the gun
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be #1
Tell me what it takes to be #1
