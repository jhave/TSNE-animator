Song:   If I Wanna
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[A.G.]
I take it back to rope chains if I wanna
I go stand out in the rain if I wanna
I get high on the plane, nigga die for my name
Double platinum on the train if I wanna
I come to the club strapped if I wanna
I throw the trees to the flares if I wanna
I even blow it in the air then leave with a rat
Or grab the baddest bitch here if I wanna
You don't believe me I already got her number
She started actin cute so I had to shun her
So I'ma leave with this chick, matter fact changed my mind
Go back and get that bitch if I want her
I take it off and get nude if I wanna
Go skinnydippin in the pool if I wanna
This lady knew me since younger said "Nigga got lumber?"
I just tell that I want her if I want her

[Chorus]
("Nobody's fault but mine...")
Now let me see you talk {"like this" - Slick Rick}
Now let me see you walk 
Huh, let me see you party nigga, drink 'til you drop
Let me see you bounce {"like this"}
I said I walk how I wanna walk - do it
I said I play how I wanna play - do it
I said I talk how I wanna talk, say what I wanna say
If that's how you feel then - do it

[A.G.]
("Nobody's fault but mine...")
I double date by myself if I wanna
Me and two chicks bitch hotter than the summer
I'm a live nigga, like a bass player and a drummer
I do a acapella album if I wanna
I keep it gully, feed the hungry if I wanna
I go hang out in other countries if I wanna
I got a pocket full of money, and I'm lookin all bummy
Who wouldn't want me if I want her
I can be, cold or cool if I wanna
I can wear red or blue if I wanna
I cop a truck - old or new - wait 'til you grow, well I grew
I play the point in shoes if I wanna
Now she's a whore make sure you lose her number
These niggaz worse than bitches in the Hummer
Now we can go the shook route or get the rooks out
Or let my face wolf out if I wanna

[Chorus]

("Nobody's fault but mine, yeah - no...")</pre>
