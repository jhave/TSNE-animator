Sticky in my swish man gasoline FLO'

Aye (OH!)
Pass the pine to the pimp old juice killer
Catch your eye in one glimpse old school with the
Ass up high the front dip drip BAM

Eighty-five for half and forty-five for quarter

And I'm jumping in your bitch if she at a PLAYER
Jumping in the painted thing on that Dang-A-Dangs

[CHORUS]

Aye (OH!)
It's young Weezy cant nothing see me DOG
I get you done easy with one easy phone call
And the sawed off make your arms fall off
Like a short sleeved polo...wont bother me no more
Ice like strobe light...look like I'm moving slo mo'
Probaly look nice on low pro Yokahomas
With '20 inch chromes poking out 'em
Chrissy till the dome tote the ganja 
Redbone in the shower
Hello! Pochahontas give a long stroke poke for hours
Floating vagina oh I'ma holla
So coke and the nanies I'm honest man
Nothing big maybe ounces, grams
But I know how to double...and sometimes it's scams
But I know to hustle...and some glocks'll jam
But I know how to bust'em...and some drops'll slam
All alloy buttons that's all stunting 
That boy's something YEAH
