[Intro/Chorus - Chamillionaire]
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Chamillitary mayne
Most of these rappers tell nothin but lies (nothin but lies)
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Nahhhhh, nah, nah, nah (woo, woo)
You can tell that they lyin when you look in their eyes
(Why are we...late)
Stop lyin, you boys ain't makin nothin (stop lyin)
Stop lyin, you boys ain't makin nothin (stop lyin)
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Stop lyin, you boys ain't makin nothin
If you ask me they all frontin

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Yeah, see the sophomore album comin (Oh oh oh oh oh), the definition of horror
I don't need your fake friends or your fake Hakuna Matatas (woo) (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Osama, the Unabomber, Kevorkian, Jeffrey Dahmer
Decided to get together, they never could do what I'm a
(Why are we...late)
It's like every thought I think is equivalent to a dollar
If I lost 10 million, I'd shrivel into a baller (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Money never smaller, stacks taller than Jordan's father
My wallet be lookin pregnant, Ben Franklin gonna have a daughter
Holla, if you ever mess with my dollars
You'll be pissed on like your name was Isiah Thomas
Your label took your album, threw it up in the air and they shot it (blaow)
Now that the rap game is rotted, I gotta do somethin 'bout it (Why are we...late)
I was movin mixtapes, while Dre was movin the "Chronic"
Started movin millions, soon as Kanye's moved into "College"
I can take ya overseas in the villas that look exotic
You would think it's open bar how the water look like Hypnotiq (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I'm the "Million Dollar Man", my money movin "Bionic"
Fast like the month of what  Ramadan do if you Islamic (yeah) (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Bow down to the Mecca, the minute the kid is spotted
They like "hassa lamma lakem," the chick I'm with is a goddess (Why are we...late)
And the drop broad is a foreigner like she Scottish
I make sure the feet stay with a pedicure, keep 'em polished (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Am I not the best to come out of Houston   Man be honest
How come my name in they mouth more than they orthodontist  (Oh oh oh oh oh)
If I say that I'm the best, then just know that I'm bein honest
If I say I'm filthy rich, then just know that I'm bein modest (Oh oh oh oh oh)
You doubt it, just think about it, success gonna assist my promise
I'm able to pull unlimited digits out of my wallet (Why are we...late)
My digits ain't got no limits, my digits turn into commas
My crib so big in mileage, your mansion look like a cottage (haha) (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Uh, better not tell me you ain't got it
If money you owe's the topic, if money you owe's the topic
If money you owe's the topic, you better come through and drop it
Better pull somethin outta your ass (outta your ass), like a colonic
When ya fail, they all yell, so that y'all sound like some riots
The crowd goes wild, the "Victory's" been decided (Why are we...late)
Platinum makes 'em be quiet, you wish that you had some silence
(*silence for 3 seconds*)
Not Gangsta Boo, I ain't gotta ask "Where Da Dollars At " (where da dollars at )
I could show you exactly where the dollars stacks (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I have you pacin, I'm navigatin, like I'm a map
Like mapquest with the moula, when it come down to that (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Y'all tried to wish me out the spot, but I'm still here
Have to have cheated cause this life don't even feel fair (yeah) (Why are we...late)
Pushin the chrome like I'm rollin on a wheelchair
My money longer than the Bin Laden beard hair (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I'm still rippin up the game, do you hear the tear  (tear)
The world still round and y'all still square (Oh oh oh oh oh)

[Outro/Chorus - Chamillionaire]
Yeah
Mixtape Messiah ... 3 
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Most of these rappers tell nothin but lies (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Nah, nah, nah, nah
You can tell that they lyin when you look in their eyes (Why are we...late)
Stop lyin, you boys ain't makin nothin
Stop lyin, you boys ain't makin nothin (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Stop lyin, you boys ain't makin nothin
If you ask me they all frontin ...
