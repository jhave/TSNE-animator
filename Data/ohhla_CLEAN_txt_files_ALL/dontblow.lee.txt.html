From a correctional facility in Missouri
And may be recorded or monitored..

[City Spud]
Yo nigga, this City
Answer the phone next time
You prolly gonna call right back but
Ight? One..

[Intro: Murphy Lee]
(Don't blow it)
City spud said whut up
And to give you this message..

(Don't blow it - repeat 2X)
Ali said peace
And learn today's lesson..

(Don't blow it - repeat 2X)
Kyjuan said them
New Jordans comin' out..

(Don't blow it - repeat 2X)
And Nelly said there's
Gon be a party down south

[Hook: City Spud - repeat 4X]
For the nigga mention my name
I let him know the deal
City nigga, the same nigga
You thought was a lame nigga

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
Now Murphy Lee is really ready
Fully preparred and well done
I told you that I'd give you my all if I sell none
Expected to sell plenty
Lotta more than Kenny
Big as "Coming To Amerrica" since I came and sent it
They saw he got his own money
"That boy got his own money!"
So please don't try to take nuttin from me
I'm talkin' consequences, all my conses see quence
Will literaly take yo face off for the tiniest reason
I'm eas-un, eas-un on down down down down down
Makin' my rounds, I'm like a new Santa in town
Clown, calm down
I got issues like magazines
I'll leave you washed up, cut and cooked like Mama greens
You only cook erry once in a while like lima beans
Me, I'm therre all the time behind the scenes
Livin' my little dream (Uh-oh!)
Smokin' on Cali green (Uh-oh!)
Me, Mike Veen, federal in tinted limousines derrty..

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
Come on derrty be for real
I can let you know the deal like a salesman
I could get you out of these bars like a jail bail man
But nah, I'm a rapper I'ma put you in bars
Judge Murphy recommend then niggas put em in charge
You practice lookin' hard and you missin' preseason
So when it's gametime you on the side chearrleadin'
I'll have you breathing in and out like Ali
Hatas like Marley, he hot like tamales
I'm the same derrty
That came wit them boys in the Range derrty
And it's strange how we 16 mil in they change derrty
Exchange the Range for the six fo' that sit low
Hatas sick though, mad cuz they didn't like us from the get-go
I tip-toe through beats, complete style unique
16's in the hallway, probably take you a week
I critique my lifestyle, I change my game cuz of fame
It's a shame to see results in you mentioning in my name

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Many many many many
Many mention Murphy Lee name like I'm a reference
I'ma make yo ass S.A.T. is you try to test me
I hang where the best be, never been on jet skis
Been to D.C. and LA like Tyrone Nesby
Though, most definitely I'm worldwide like Pepsi
And I take carre of my whole household like Jeffrey
So why you hatas wish to mention my name, mayn?
Can't understand I'm just doin' my thang
Yo I change for nay-nada nudda muddasucker
I'll sell music instead of drugs, fans instead of cluckers
Ya dig? I'm original like a black man wit a gig
And not eatin' pig is why I had to split ya wig
But they might, and he might
You know they watchin' the person who watchin' the person
Jockin' my Johnny Cochran you cornball
All of em stick like a corn dog
48 bars I'm on y'all, I warned y'all...
