[Cee-Lo Green]
Well I wandered around after hour of words
And I've waited in vain here for weeks
The ghost of a girlfriend that's here in my room
I still smell her perfume in my sheets
But that's not her in my bed, no she's out on the town
And I don't anyone to see
There's a tattoo of my name on her body but obviously
The man holding her hand isn't me
Oh honey how could you regret me when you can't even forget me babe

[Chorus]
It's okayyy, to say that you love meeee
Cause I think of you (all night long) still think of you (all night long)
Ohh it's okayyy! To say that you love meeee!
I think of you (all night long) still thinkin of you (all night long)

[Cee-Lo Green]
I thought that once you've had one, you've had every woman
Until I lost this legendary woman
(Shit) Now I'm sure
That they don't make 'em like her any more
So PLEASE~! baby, PLEASE~! lover
Let's find a way to forgive each other
I've gotten around ever since you've been gone
But without you I'm still alone
Ohh how can you regret me when you know you can't forget me and

[Chorus]

[Cee-Lo Green]
I make mistakes, I'm only hu-man
And I am not ashamed to sayyyyyyy
That you, are, the onnnnnnnnnnne
... and

[Chorus] w/ minor variations, followed by dub Chorus

[Outro]
Oooooooooooooooh
Said I love you</pre>
