[G. Simone]
Now that I have co-ooome we're gonna have some fun

Hangin out all day-ayyy, the summer's on it's way-ayyy

[Chorus: G. Simone]
She won't, let you down..
Lookin all a-weepy around
She hits the hardest hip-hop sounds
She won't, play around..
When it's time to break it down
Listen closely to the sound

Ye-yeah!
So gimme the funk, gimme the funk, not the junk, while the trunk
pumps behind me G. Simone, got the music for the 90's

[G. Simone]
Won't you listen please, I'll put your mind at ease

Turnin up the bass, the treble's in your face
G. Simone has got the music for the 90's

[Chorus]

[KRS-One]
B-Boys in the house, turn it up, turn it up
G. Simone is in the place, lick two shots, BUCK BUCK
We're comin to you live and direct with the feelin
that G. Simone keeps the party jumpin to the ceilin
Yes this is the mad funk, females need to back up
When G. Simone reach the mic, brothers start to act up
Turn the track up, black, you won't be dissapointed
It's the music for the 90's kid - GET UP ON IT!

[G. Simone]
