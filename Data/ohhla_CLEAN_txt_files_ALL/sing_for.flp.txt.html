[Verse One- Lil' Flip]
Haha
I'm black, but I know how to rock n roll
I know how to rock the crack, and rock the show
Then I roll out, cuz I can't hold out
That's why every concert I do, is sold out
From, Houston, Dallas and Lafayette
I got, white boys, that bump my shit
I got this game locked, and I lost the key
And it seem like everybody, want sumthin for free
And now all the hoes say, they comin' wit me
Cuz they know they smell good, when they runnin' wit me
But I ain't trickin', I'm just stickin'
This ain't chicken, so I ain't lickin'
Cuz Imma pimp hoe, and I got good bangin' hoe
No matter where I go, they love me in the hood mayne
I guess I'm in the good lane, cuz now I'm doin' great
Even though I'm showin' love, some niggaz still hate

[Hook]
Sing with me
Sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing it with me, Just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away..

[Verse Two- Lil' Flip]
It's two-thousand three, and I'm twenty two
I ain't changin', I still got three hundred tennis shoes
I ain't changed, I just like to chill alone
Cuz every other day, I'm in a different time zone
Signin' autographs, for all my fans
Cuz that'S how it go, when ya music in demand
I flew straight to Japan, to make eighty grand
I bought a house on the beach, now I got me a tan
I push the lex lan, cuz Imma tex-an
Pump call shawn taylor, tell 'em get them checks in
Cuz I need mine, before I sign my contract
I gotta read mine, if I pray everythang gon be fine
You know I run the streets
I drop my vocals before my niggaz stomp the beats
I bring the heat, just like my name was Pat Riley
I'm my CEO, you can't fire me, bitch

[Lil' Flip - talking]
haha that's what I've said nigga
This how we do it, we sing for the moment
We don't know how long this shit gon last
So we gon keep droppin' this heat, on yo motherfuckin' ass
Everyday, mixtapes, undergrounds whatever
That's how we get our money, nigga
We gotta supply the demand
Lil' Flip, represent cloerland
Southside, that's where I stay
Home of the braves, fuck the glocks, put on the k's
Sing it wit 'em

[Hook]
Sing with me
Sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing it with me, Just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away..

[Third Verse- Lil' Flip]
Last verse now, ye
I gotta sing for the moment, for hum birthday
Nigga, I bought a ring for my homie
That's how we do it nigga, he shop for me
Fuck it nigga like I said, Imma cop the key
Gotta get that good money, ain't fuck wit that evil money
Even thought I had to fuck wit that illegal money
Love money, could be drug money
But shit, I got tatoos it's all thug money
I'm lil flip, I know you like how I spit
Shit, cuz niggaz know this underground but it still a hit
It ain't my beat but, it's my lyrics so, when you hear this shit
Yur gonna love to hear it cuz I, spit to ya spirits
From the shit that I say, niggaz know freestylin' shit be everyday
I do that shit when I don't feel like it, but I'm like a phychic
Cuz you can predict what Imma do nigga, keep fightin'
Writin', freestylin', smilin' wit my ice
Go to the car lot, nigga fuck the price (fuck the price)

[Lil' Flip - talking]
Haha, we used to didn't have a lot, now we got a lot
Each time we thank god for what we got
We worked hard to get where we got
And we sittin' on top
No matter what you do, keep ya head up

[Hook]
Sing with me
Sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing it with me, Just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away..
Sing with me
Sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing it with me, Just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away..</pre>
