[Kardinal Offishall]
Yo! Come mi suh mek a likkle way
Here comes the Fireman and mi no play
Sounds get a little ??? from the verses that I spray
Remember I don't play and I don't take no disrespect in any way
Gangsta - I hear dem likkle punks
I see the crooked way you like to walk
But Jah Jah has a better understanding of the way I like to move
Ain't got nothing to prove and I am not wasting a second checkin you
Punk - the speakers in the trunk
The bass is overloaded feel the tump
The highs are sounding high-high super high
Watch a di man dem kiss the sky
Everything a everything so you know Kardinal don't have to lie
Nah - the world is what I want
I'm not gonna lose my flow trying to flaunt
Me nah gon' try and fit in with the Devil I am on another seat
..IS WHY YOU LITTLE BEWARE ITS A RUDE BOY!

[Chorus: Lindo P]

[Kardinal]
Yo! I represent my crew

And naturally we all are insecure but ya haffi dash wey that fi sure
Soon as it hit the door ya haffi mek dem know say man a come fi more
