(First let me introduce myself)
Hello, this is your Disneyland storyteller
And I have a story to tell you
This time it all happened in the jungle

[Verse 1: Suffa]
Now this is a story about a monkey named Powder
A happy little monkey his friends used to crowd around the
Base of the tree that he lived in and wait all day
And asked his mumma if its ok it powder came out to play
So they could swing from vine to vine through the jungle
And from time to time one would tumble to the grassy floor (uh)
The powder would be there for them you couldn't ask for more
Cos he was always there for friends
One day in the woods he was just swinging around
Till a python in a tree came slithering down and said
'Powder put out your hand, now I won't bite it'
Take this flyer there's a party on tonight and you're invited
It's at the Lions Den doors open at ten
Can't wait, don't be late cya then bring your friends
(yesss yesss) bring your friends
(yesss yess) bring your friends

[Chorus/Hook]
It's about a curious place (in the jungle)
and I'm going to tell you the famous story of (in the dark quiet jungle)
(The jungle! Survive alone in the jungle!)
We've got a long journey ahead of us
I wanna stay in the jungle
I'm not afraid I can look after myself...

[Verse 2: Suffa]
So they went to the party a crazy jungle disco
Calypso rhythms flamingos doing strip shows
The DJ was an alligator on the fader
At the bar little powder was approached by the waiter
The waiter said Powder the club owner wants to meet ya
And took him to a lion in the corner named Ibiza
Ibiza let out a low growl and called to the waiter
And asked for two cuts of fermented potatoes
He said "have you ever had something stronger than these?"
Powder said "well me and my friends used to smoke banana leaves"
"That's kids stuff this stuff will make you feel like your mr. big stuff
com'on take a sniff of this dust"
Powder tried to disguise the fear in his eyes
Looked at the lion and said "I guess it couldn't hurt to try"
(I'm not afraid) I guess it couldn't hurt to try
(I'm not afraid) I guess it couldn't hurt to try

[Chorus/Hook]

[Verse 3: Suffa]
Now little Powders worlds completely spinning
He's dribbling and grinning making passes at women
And talking 'bout him self cause now he's mr. important
He's friends don't understand cause they didn't snort it
Powder says "forget you guys man you the past
I'll swap any one of you for just another blast
Or a piece of arse, whose that dime she's looking fine
By the way where's that lion I wouldn't mind another line"
The lion obliged powder felt his nose rip apart
He felt pains in his chest as if his heart was exploding
He stumbled out to the road in a daze
Going red in the face now he's choking
The dope in his system that made him overdose
No longer powder the monkey now he's Powder the ghost
(The ghost ghost) now he's Powder the ghost
(The ghost ghost) now he's Powder the gho-o-ost
