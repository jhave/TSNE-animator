[Chorus]
Dirty got my mind gone, that money got my my mind blown
Dirty got my mind gone, that money got my my mind blown
Dirty got my mind gone, that money got my my mind blown
Dirty got my mind gone, that money got my my mind blown
That money got my mind blown, money got my mind blown
Money got my mind blown blown blown blown
That money got my mind blown, money got my mind blown
Money got my mind blown blown blown blown

[2 Chainz]
The feds tapping phones so I talk in codes
The shit jumping out the gym I ain't talking pros
Polo on my draws, Bentley in my drive way
I was in the trap when you was on Myspace
Money on my mind state, increase the crime rate
Pinky Ring so big you can see it on the blind day
Car game irate, we park outside
SS on it and that's... for south side
Outside pulling, duice and the juices
Two two cups on me, shout out to Houston
We got a problem Houston, they take on style they boostin'
They Lame Man, they hoes knew it
They lame man, they hoes knewit

[Chorus]

[Future]
Future - Billie Jean... Reincarnated
You bitch be too fascinated, with my conversation
Get a load of me, and u hallucinatin
I'm hypnotizin ladies I got em in the matrix
Switch with the youngs go put the lama, go put your camera
Never blend in cause I always stand out
You not came up, brought the swag I got some benz up
Have two cups of dirty, my necklace on the birdy
And I ball for the hall of fame - James Worthy!
And I'm drinking on Magic, (why that?) Yellow &amp; Purple
You can have a sip, if you gettin thirsty
Chorus

[Waka Flocka Flame]
My man gone hard, I go harder
Bust it for me baby girl, do the miss Parker
She super thick, my little college chick
Is she down the kiss another girl she with that freaky shit
Flex, I must admit show my ass like my breaks down when I'm on public
I'll be ballin bitch
I'm walking liqd (SQUADDDD), sixty on my wrist
Hundred on my neck screaming bitch I got that check
Stop playing with em, girl back it off
Drop you bands on yo foreheads, stack it up
Waka flocka hand a vip that bitch is acting up
Acking up, acking up, acking up, stacking up</pre>
