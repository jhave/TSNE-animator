[Domo Genesis]
My money burn; synonymous to treatment of the fuzzy herb
I keep it G - in places you wishin you and your niggaz be
Salute the Gang, bitches cheerom loud for the winnin team
Bring it home, pull it out, break it down, roll it up
Smell it while we rolling down the street, you niggaz know it's us
We got that fire, man you niggaz know whassup
King Zag papers, Juan the only nigga rollin blunts
Other than that, you lame niggaz is whack
Smoking on a J, while I'm smokin on a track
Cliche shit, stay way way far from basic
Kush cologne, I wear mines, no K-Swiss
Damn, all I get is high
and brains from a long-haired mistress prefer the skinnin light
Prejudice, marijuana evidence
Pipes, bong, vapes got me blown out my element, element

[Chorus]
Every single day I smoke (smoke) {*4X*}
I get high, I get high, grams of the greenbacks
I get high, I get high, grams of the green sacks
I get high, I get high, grams of the greenbacks
I get high, I get high, grams of the green sacks

[Hodgy Beats]
I grasp my intoxication, digital cinema, third dimension
I can't move, verb suspension
Puttin my lips to the purp, hemp burns is tempting
Bitches in the studio, and we copped about a quarter
On the phone with her dad, I'm gettin high with his daughter
Euphoria, mouth cotton percent - a hundred
Many places I go, or I have went, I'm blunted
Weed you got it I want it, I want it if you got weed
T-T-H-H-H-H-C
Out of no eyes, I'm so high, hashish I can provide
In yo' life, you gotta pick it up, cause I have no ride
When you arrive, I'll be outside loitering
I hate potheads who front like they don't blaze it
Your body needs Mary Jane nigga, it craves it
I welcome Mary Jane, she doesn't violate
Inhale, exhale, feel the vi-buh-ra-tion

[Outro]
Smoke it up {*3X*}
Bitch smoke it up
Smoke up
Just smoke it up
Wanna smoke it up
Just smoke it up
Lady you can pass it to the right {*5X*}
Right now I'm tryin to take a hike
from the cloud, down, so pass it to the right
So we can be higher than a
Smoke it up
Bitch smoke it up
Come on nigga smoke it up
Shit, you gon' smoke or what?
Alright then bitch smoke it up
Roll up to smoke up
Shit, smoke it up
I'm smokin up
Lady you can pass it to the right {*6X*}
Puff, puff and then pass it to the right
So we can be higher than a
Smoke it up
(Smoke it up) {*2X*}
Drop it, pass it to the right
Higher than a
