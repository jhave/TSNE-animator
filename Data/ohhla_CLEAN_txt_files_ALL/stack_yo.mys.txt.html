Ball til you fall, young nigga fuck the haters

Ball til you fall, young nigga fuck the haters 
Stack yo Chips, get yo paper

(Mystikal) 
I'm movin too fast, doing to much for these niggas 
Hum bro 
I get paid to leave the house sideways 
Bitch stickn out, what 
I can take it without quessn' 
You the mutha fuckin coward 
And I'm the big bad wolf nigga
And I'm coming to devoiour 
Aint nuthin better than money
Sex and the power 
Oh how I love to be on top of the power
Fuck 
I got it to go wit it, clownish 
out dat back cuttin up telly to telly bouncn' 
I got 5 women, 4 cars
3 homes and 2 apartments
A rolex, 10 leather jackets, 
And 20 pair of Michael Jordans 
All in it, front and back wheels spinnin 
I might not bid to you 
But I'm the shit in the city 
Street things, represent the real no lim 
Razor sharp rhymes penatrating you skin 
The way I drop 
Bitch gotta feel them 
I'm that close 
Try to stop me from gettn' it 

(Ughhhhhh) 
Stack yo Chips, get yo paper 
Ball til you fall, young nigga fuck the haters 
Stack yo Chips, get yo paper 
Ball til you fall, young nigga fuck the haters 
Stack yo Chips, get yo paper 
Ball til you fall, young nigga fuck the haters 
Stack yo Chips, get yo paper 
Ball til you fall, young nigga fuck the haters 

(C-Murder) 
I make a million dollar dream become reallity without a doubt 
I get paid for every rhyme coming out my mouth 
And gangsta rap pays the bills so I represent it 
And who we be, 
Some soldiers down that no limit 
My young thugs love to get high off of my lyrics 
I have em' tweakn' 
Possessed like an evil spirit 
We on the rise, 
But labeled as them bad guys 
We're family tied, 
And run like the enterprize 
Fool is you legal, 
But bugs is segal 
This aint no sequil, 
You damn sure not my equal 
And playa haters don't last too long 
a million muthafuckas with my disc 
Sittin at they home 
My edvasaries is slowly being put to death 
I catch em gaspin 
And trying to breathe 
They last breath 
I mean you reaching for the stars 
But you cant grip 
I told ya, get yo paper nigga 
Stack yo chips. 

(Ughhhhhh) 
Stack yo Chips, get yo paper 
Ball til you fall, young nigga fuck the haters 
Stack yo Chips, get yo paper 
Ball til you fall, young nigga fuck the haters 
Stack yo Chips, get yo paper 
Ball til you fall, young nigga fuck the haters 
Stack yo Chips, get yo paper 
Ball til you fall, young nigga fuck the haters</pre>
