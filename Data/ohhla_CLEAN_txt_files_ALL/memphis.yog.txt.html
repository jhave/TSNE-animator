[Verse]
Now I don't make dance songs I'm kind of new to this
Well Mr. Collipark got me on some other shyt
No I was raised on that North Memphis gutta shyt
Niggas was pop lockin I was tryna down a brick
And I don't dance cause I don't like to sweat a lot
I keep it gangsta I just hit the club and Memphis walk
You gotta lean rock with it bounce to the beat
You know me Yo Gotti I'm a keep it street
Swing ya arms a little bit den move ya feet
40 caliber poking through my white t
And everywhere I go they like the way I talk mane
Memphis running through my veins shawty that's a Memphis thang

[Chorus]
Blow A Whole Lotta Green Sip A Whole Lotta Purp
Tryna Spend Some Money You Can Hit Me On My Chirp
A Do The Memphis Walk (check)The Memphis Walk (check) [x2]
Got Whole Lotta Whips On A Whole Bunch Of Chrome
Been All Around The World But Ain't Nothin Like Home
A Do The Memphis Walk (check) The Memphis Walk (check) [x2]

[Verse]
A whole lotta liquor and a whole lotta dro
Whole lotta lean got em movin kinda slow
You can still do the dance it ain't hard to keep up
So smokers hold up your lighters and drinkers hold up your cups
Shawty kinda thick so I post up like a thug
Memphis walked up on her and told her I wanna fuk
She lookin at my watch and my chain like what's up
Little did she know that I got it for 70 bucks
Went from Memphis walking to Memphis gliding
In a 80 thousand dollar whip on rims and tires
I'm just tryna come up homie don't knock my grind
Tell the DJ to play this shyt one more time

[Chorus]
Blow A Whole Lotta Green Sip A Whole Lotta Purp
Tryna Spend Some Money You Can Hit Me On My Chirp
A Do The Memphis Walk (check)The Memphis Walk (check) [x2]
Got Whole Lotta Whips On A Whole Bunch Of Chrome
Been All Around The World But Ain't Nothin Like Home
A Do The Memphis Walk (check) The Memphis Walk (check) [x2]

[Verse]
St. Louis they do the mono Atlanta they do that snapping shyt
Memphis we get that money from pimpin hoes and on wraping bricks
Killer Cali they sea walk New York they get it boxed
Got it straight out the M and I'm just tryna keep my city hot
H Town they lean Chi Town they stepping
Memphis throw up that sign to let u know what they reppin like
Thumbs up North North that's what I'm about
Raise ya pinky up if you represent the South
O's up M's down that's Orange Mound
From the East to the West eveytbody put it down
Talk so much street shyt damn near got indited
I'm from Memphis Tennessee it ain't another city like it

[Chorus]
Blow A Whole Lotta Green Sip A Whole Lotta Purp
Tryna Spend Some Money You Can Hit Me On My Chirp
A Do The Memphis Walk (check)The Memphis Walk (check) [x2]
Got Whole Lotta Whips On A Whole Bunch Of Chrome
