(*talking*)
It's repo time motherfucker
If you owe me, I'm here to collect
All that roaching and reaching
I'm fin to put a stop to this shit nigga
Trae the Truth, Asshole By motherfucking Nature
Don't use my motherfucking name, for no pass out here
I ain't putting no stamp on that shit

[Trae]
Bitch I'm here to collect and flipping on Patrone, in a '67
I got the trunk stocked up like the law, but shit gaurunteed to make a felon
So it ain't shit to be talking about, unless it's money your checking
Or the fact they ass about to get touched up, in about less than three seconds
If you owe me you better pay me mine, or get served like some gangsta shit
But I think you better think a bit, and remember I'm a gangsta bitch
All these niggaz roaching my name and my face, like I fuck's with they ass
I bet they switch it up, with this right foot of mine stuck up they ass
I'm like a problem, that'll come get a nigga when he least expect it
Ain't no friends in this bidness, just money and power respected
I don't do no credit or give no loan, and don't do no consignment
If I do it's on the block, to lead you in coffin confinement
And I ain't thinking twice, my advice nigga pay the price
Why you capping trying to wear that ice, try me and you can pay for life
I'm Trae the Truth, and I'm the one that they told you to dodge
Cause it's A.B.N., and we issue ass whooping's for a job

[Hook]
Where my money
I need-I need-I need cash (Trae) - 4x
Where my money
You don't want to be here, when I blast (Trae) - 4x

[Trae]
If you owe me consider it double, try something fly I'm gon get ya
I ain't trying to hear none of that shit, bitch I'm here to collect my issue
Consider me doing your ass a favor, if you still able to breathe
If you ain't got it then I can remind you, that you still able to bleed
I operate off my cash, if my cash slow that's your ass
Why you thinking of trying to roach, I just came to revoke your pass
Give me whatever you got in your stash, you delinquent at paying funds
Don't make me lead you by example, it's dangerous playing with guns
That ain't a threat hoe that's the truth, and I'm willing to bet it all
And if you play with Trae the Truth, then I'm willing to bet you fall
Who the fuck gave these niggaz they nerves, thinking they hard as a brick
It don't matter, I'ma bring they ass back down to reality quick
And you know what it is, nigga don't act like you don't
Bitch I invest in the block, and they know I get what I want
Right off the muscle you piss me off, and you gonna be a sad man
When it come to money, call me a bad bad man
