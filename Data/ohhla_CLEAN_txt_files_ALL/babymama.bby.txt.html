[Snoop Dogg]
Huh-huh, new American
How ya love dat'
Off the hizzle fa' shizzle dizzle
Get it to me Baby fizzle
(Check it, check it, check it) Yeah, yeah!

[Babyface]
Girl you got your busines in the street
Claimin' that your [shit] is weak
Been six months since you've been gone
How come you ain't called?
When you don't feel love no more
You got no right to close the door
You loved her once
And she's got proof
Baby boy looks just like you

Chorus:
[Babyface]
Yo' get her love and much respect
Even if she's got man
Ghetto, player you must understand
That's you baby's momma
Don't be late payin' your bills
It takes two to make a kid
When the hell you gon' understand
That's you baby's momma

[Snoop Dogg]
Tell the baby goodbye (baby goodbye)
'Cause you don't wanna be by (wanna be by)
The way you acting... fly (they way you acting... fly)
Girl you know you livin' a lie (livin' a lie)

[Babyface]
I heard you got a chick on the side
I hope you got it right this time
Heard she got inside your mind
Hatin' on your family ties
She's got no right to dawg her out
That is the mother of your child
You loved her once and that's the truth
Baby boy looks just like you

Chorus:
[Babyface]
Yo' get her love and much respect
Even if she's got man
Ghetto, player you must understand
That's you baby's mama
Don't be late payin' your bills
It takes two to make a kid
When the hell you gon' understand
That's you baby's mama

[Snoop Dogg]
Let me holla at y'all for a second
You say you don't love her
You push her and you shove her
That's your first son's mother
Word to mother, if it's that bad
Then go and get another
She kicked ya to the curb
and now you're livin' in the gutta, st-st-stutter
[Nigga] what up?
That child suppote (support)
Is tearin' you butt up
Nut up, cut up, and act a fool
Raisin' hell at the daycare school
They threw you in jail for not payin' you dues
You couldn't even buy yo son dem new Kobe shoes
Alotta fools say they do but they don't
I know you're mad you got to hate boo
Gon' wait it through, let's see what he gon' do
He might, better yet better
The court wrote a letter
To be real wich you, you gotta kid wich you
So one to one, man to man
He got to deal wich you

[Babyface]
How you gonna act when you [shit] is strong?
When you don't even claim your own
How can you even sleep
When you know you're wrong
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up (wake up, wake up)
How you gonna act when you family's gone
'Cause they tired of the [shit] you do (all the [shit] you do)
How you gonna feel when you can't go home
'Cause there ain't nobody there for, you!

Chorus:
[Babyface] (Snoop Dogg)
Yo' get her love and much respect
Even if shes got man
Ghetto, player you must understand
That's you baby's momma (baby mama drama)
Don't be late payin' your bills
It takes two to make a kid (to make a kid)
When the hell you gon' understand
That's you baby's momma (baby mama drama)
Yo' get her love and much respect (yeah, love her)
Even if shes got man (respect that)
Ghetto, player you must understand (uh)
That's you baby's momma (that's yo baby's mama)
Don't be late payin' your bills (uh-uh, yeah!)
It takes two to make a kid (money, money, money)
When the hell you gon' understand
That's you baby's momma (that's yo baby's mama)

[Snoop Dogg]
Tell the baby goodbye (baby goodbye)
'Cause you don't wanna be by (wanna be by)
The way you acting... fly (they way you acting... fly)
Girl you know you livin' a lie (livin' a lie)
(That's your baby's momma uh...)
Tell the baby goodbye (baby goodbye)
'Cause you don't wanna be by (wanna be by)
The way you acting... fly (they way you acting... fly)
Girl you know you livin' a lie (livin' a lie)
(That's your baby's momma uh...)</pre>
