[The Grouch]
That looks good but what's on the inside?
What's on the other side?
What's on the flip?
Tell me what I get, is it all of what I see?
If I give you all of me then am I trippin?
Listen!

[Bicasso]
It was a late night
You just got dissed, just got faded
Dismissed as your girl twists up another fib
Tryin' to hem you up for some shit you never did
Makin' this relationship stressed out
Flippin' her wig
Talkin' bout cheatin'
When she be clubbin' every weekend
With her friends who you know and know you
Know what you do sometimes smile and joke to
But in your head you stay true
They crew is hella fine
While her pagers blowin' up
There's no keepin' up with her mind
When she doin' her thing she's out doin' her thing
But it don't seem right
Your girl looks tight
But something don't seem right
What's on the inside

[Chorus]

[Aesop]
I got shook
I took a second glance
Grabbed her from the dance floor
Enhance the game
We danced for a while then I told her my name
She got her soul hooked
It only took a minute or so
Then back to the room, lets get blowed
She was way out of control
She was hella bold, yes I'm bold too
So you know what we had to do
Take off the shoes, let's relax, kick back
Let's smoke this sack
Without force she reached in her back pack
And pulled a torch
Now we high, I'm feelin' up her thighs
Looked inside her eyes never tried to realize
She's faded!
Barely made it out the bar
Wasn't really hard to get this groupie out her car
"Don't worry honey my house ain't far"
Is what I told her
Bumped the new CD to make the pee pee smolder
Her momma told her don't mess with MCs
When she got older,
Yes her mamma was wise
She was lookin' on the out
And not the inside
Ya got to analyze what's right in front of your eyes!!!

[Chorus]

[PSC]
Got tricked by the smoke and the screen it seems
Hollywood ain't really all that it seems
With my team at the El Rey and y'all know how we play
A show with the fellowship we ripped and skipped
To the Hyatt minus the dips
We on a road trip over all the bullshit
Glamour and the glitz
I wish we never had to go through what happened next
But history repeats itself
And I've been used to getting dissed
If wishes ever come true, this is one I entertained
Mr. BDP requested meeting of the gang (double L)
Over to the office we proceeded
Hype and curious about what he needed
Greeted by pounds and hugs major love
Next came the pitch on how we supposed to sign up
"Get under the wing" Rap City/MTV
All them things that momma and my sister want to see for me
Next scene performing at a club
For the label that he runs
We supposed to sign up
Put us up in the Holiday Inn on Highland
We do the show everybody drunk and smiling
Leak out the info that we bout to sign it
But little did we know that the Blastmaster's lying
Another chapter in this book called the Legends
Everything ain't never what it seems and that's forever

[Murs]
It was light blue and looked like an aspirin
"Why ain't you tried it yet"
Everybody's askin'
That's when I start flashin'
"That's for rich kids and ravers!"
But now it's gone major
It seems like the new official generation X hip-hop party favor
It alters behavior
Erases all your grief
Got all my homies touchy feely straight grindin' their teeth
I was in disbelief and a little ashamed
When I found out all the names
Of my homies on the "E" train, turned into "X" men
I hope it's a decision you don't end up regretting
Heard it fucks with your spine
Not to mention your mind
Serotonin on the brain
Yeah I was "zonin'" with Eclipse
But you'll never catch me zonin' on that type of plane
Cuz I'm all for everybody doing their thang
But y'all done stepped to a level where I just can't hang
I don't even smoke weed
So why would I try something mixed with speed?
Need me to spell it out? I'm talking ecstasy
The drug everybody's trying
"Everybody else is doing it!"
Except for me
Catch me chillin' on the side staying drug free with pride

[Chorus: 2X]</pre>
