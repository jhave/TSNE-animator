[Shock G]
Cheese, put some cheese
Between your knees
A fat can of pinto beans
Cabbage and greens and rice
That's why cats chase mice
Shrimp-fried rice falafel
Roscoe's chicken and waffles
The condoms were invalid
Butter beans with egg salad

They was quick to exchange the head
But now instead, they rub each other down

[Humpty-Hump]
PeeWee came needy with the D-flo
But I said, yo, take it slow cause he knows the flow

[Shock G]
She used to be quick to lick, the trick
But now she just wanna rub em down

[Humpty-Hump]
PeeWee came fat with the D-flo
But I said, yo, take it slow cause he knows the flow

[Shock G]
She told him to strap his 'zack with the hat
Cause she didn't want to catch his fleas

[Humpty-Hump]
But it was all a bit in the wrong Christmas tree
So let's all light up a pack of butter beans!

[Shock G]
Rub me down, tonight
Just rub me down, tonight (x2)

[Digital Underground]
Body-hats, lookin for the Body-Hats (x8)

[Humpty-Hump]
Latex for my eyes, to protect me from the TV lies

Barring abstinence the Body-Hat is the best known protection
Against FADES: Falsely Acquired Diluted Education Syndrome

[Humpty-Hump]
Yeah, I need a jim hat form my ears
Blockin out somebody else's fears, know what I'm sayin
Yo, check this out, check it out

[Shock G]
She used to be quick to lick, the trick
But now she just wanna rub em down

[Humpty-Hump]
How about a big plate of curried goat with some barbecued oxtail?

[Shock G]
Yeah, keep rubbing that lotion on meee

[Humpty-Hump]
How about a big bean sprout tofu burger, know what I'm sayin

[Shock G]
She used to be quick to lick, the trick
But now she just wanna rub em down

[Humpty-Hump]
She just wanna rub em dooownn
Body-ody, ody-odeee
Yo, how about a big plate of curried goat
With some barbecued oxtails, know what I'm saying
Yeeahh, I need latex for my eyes
To protect me from the TV lies, y'all
Check it out, uh, a fat can of pinto beans

[Shock G]
Rub me down, tonight
Just rub me down, tonight (x4)</pre>
