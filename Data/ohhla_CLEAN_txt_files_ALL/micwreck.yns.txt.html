[Pete Rock]
Yeah, it's called "Mic Wreckas"
Da Youngstas, Taji, Tarik, Qur'an
And we gonna do it like this

	Who's the mic wrecka? (I'm the mic wrecka!)
	Who's the mic wrecka? (I said I'm the mic wrecka!)
	Who's the mic wrecka? (Ayo I'm the mic wrecka)
	Well let me see you wreck it

[Qur'an]
Check it, I wreck the mic so I can get further
Underground like the coalmine worker
The youngest, roughest, lyrical wizard
Crawl like a lizard, like ???
So bad that I rip up in post
I walk through hell with gasoline drawers
Heart rhyme explode when don on my dope O
Golder than gold, toke a ???
I get down, so you gotta give me a pound
When you see me, I make a hard job seem easy
Never slip up, cause I'm not an ice skater
Every time I flow I make dough like a baker
Don't like a chump, I rock you is the pump
Like a fox smell the funk, I slam like a dunk
Playing MC's like chessboard checkers
Call me king, checkmate, I'm the microphone wrecka

	Who's the mic wrecka? (I'm the mic wrecka!)
	Who's the mic wrecka? (I'm the mic wrecka!)
	Who's the mic wrecka? (I'm the mic wrecka!)
	Well let me see you wreck it

[Taji]
Taji the mic wrecka, it's time for me to wreck it
So check it, I make girls with good skins get naked
Built to last like a hacksaw
Because I'm back y'all, to put a rock on your back door
I sneak in just like a wet bandit
It's a lyrical murder, I know you hate it cause you can't stand it
I freak the rhyme til the bass start cracking
I'm rocking up spots like that nightshow Dragnet
Step to this is a no-no
I'm knocking out dolos with a pop like my name was Daddy Bobo
I wreck the mic on purpose
Doing enough damage suckers can't work on a smooth surface
Scaring MC's just like a monster
I keep the crowd hype just like a Michael Jackson concert
So you gotta respect a
Kid like me, cause I'm the microphone wrecka

	Who's the mic wrecka? (Yeah, I'm the mic wrecka!)
	Who's the mic wrecka? (C'mon, I'm the mic wrecka!)
	Who's the mic wrecka? (Yeah, I'm the mic wrecka!)
	Well let me see you wreck it

[Tarik]
Ayo I got the mad skills that make you wanna flex
I dominate this track so it's time to have sex
But just chill while I get all in it
Cause I'm about to rip it, who said I couldn't kick it
Uh, I get shots off just like a shotgun
Stick a fork in your butt, you're just about done
I pour you MC's just like a lobster
Cause this hip-hopper gets props just like a mobster
They call me 'Rik, geez, no you can't stop me
I'm too slick, I got more snags than a bullwhip
Laying pipe like a plumber, burn like a summer
Chopping down wack MC's just like lumber
And yell timber, watch you fall down down
When I work it, a member of the underground circuit
Now you're on my wood like a woodpecker
So step aside it's the microphone wrecka

	Who's the mic wrecka? (Yo, I'm the mic wrecka!)
	Who's the mic wrecka? (I'm the mic wrecka!)
	Who's the mic wrecka? (Ayo, I'm the mic wrecka!)
	Well let me see you wreck it

[Pete Rock]
The dark skin with the grin rhyming til the end, hops
(Guess who) Yes the Chocolate Wonder boy Pete Rock
So listen, New York Style so get buckwild
Cause niggas ain't taking no shorts or flicks, so bust the mix
I got a lotta tricks up my sleeve
So stick around chump cause it ain't time to leave
Da Youngstas, so 'em who's the real Mic Wrecka
(Yo, why you wanna know?) Cause I'm going straight to Mecca
Collect all the props, cause niggas jock the music
You really can't refuse it, so use it don't abuse it
Ayo it's time to go, peace see ya later
It's time to pass the mic down, yo C.L. kick the flava

[C.L. Smooth]
Who's the mic wrecka nuthin but the Mecca now building
Cause I loved my shorties like Jesus loved children
Amongst the Youngstas, for the record I gotta say
I woulda broke the mic back in your moms and pops heyday
So let me work it til the mic short circuits
Shout without a doubt, I leave the wires all hanging out
Grip it til I cause an inprint, see I raise it from an infant
Then visualize growing magnificent
The big willy chillie puffing on a lit Phillie
Knock a mic silly now you know hoe my skills be
C to the L and Smooth cause that's Mecca
To let my shorties know who's the mic wrecka

	Who's the mic wrecka? (C.L.'s the mic wrecka!)
	Who's the mic wrecka? (Pete Rock's the mic wrecka!)
	Who's the mic wrecka? (Taji's the mic wrecka!)
	We're the mic wreckas!

	Who's the mic wrecka? (Rik's the mic wrecka!)
	Who's the mic wrecka? (Yo Qur'an's the mic wrecka!)
	Who's the mic wrecka? (Everybody's mic wreckas!)
	We're the mic wreckas!
