[Intro]

[Chorus: Lil Bibby]
Goin' hard for my niggas that's all I got
Man whatever mine is yours that's all I got
And all I know is the hood that's all I got
That's on everything I love that's all I got
No I don't play about my mom she all I got
Yes I will kill you bout my brothers they all I got
No we don't talk to undercovers that's all I got
I'm either rappin' or I'm trappin' that's all I got

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Young nigga always on that gang bang shit
Bag it up, slang piff, different day same shit
This fame shit came quick, but I can't switch
They try to come and change shit but I remain this
Real nigga from the start to the finish
All my whips are tinted, and all my niggas winnin'
Yeah, you could tell the difference, I'm the realest in it
Don't make me call them killers get you gone in a minute
You know we keep that tool fam, please don't front your move fam
How you on that news cam, you shoulda stayed in school fam
That 30 gets you two grams now, they dreamin' bout a new Lam
And I, walk around with a few grand, everybody got 2 hands
She gon' fuck cause she know we them niggas
Send a bitch to the store for some swishers
So fresh I just pose for the pictures
My niggas know I won't fold on em, see the opps then roll on em
Judge offers you two years and you told on em?
Damn

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
No I won't never leave my brothers they all I got
Shit'll never be the same
Seen my 10 year nigga Kobe die right before my eyes
And I miss my bro so I'm rollin' up swishers
And I'm pourin' up a 4 right now
And you told me bro you gotta watch these niggas
They're tryna come around you now
These niggas ain't real, same niggas I was with in the field
Boy I treat em like family now
I don't got no deal I don't live in no house on the hill
Fuck nigga this all I got
And I'm still the same nigga got the gang with me
150 killers in the lane with me
In the same city Crazy Jame's with me
Betta not run up on me he gon' bang semis
Slay the game my man bitch I play to win
I won't never change, all the change I spend
All I count is bands, tryna touch an M
When I touch an M, touch an M again
Niggas come around like some immigrants
Ain't no new niggas don't remember him
Who is you nigga you ain't cool nigga
You ain't shoot nigga, just a few niggas
Heard when you get money niggas change
I ran through a lot of that I'm still the same
And my niggas honor that
I know niggas when they left the hood
They ain't bring a dollar back
I trust my niggas they know where my mama at
We brothers nigga
And don't no money come above you nigga
I'll never tell ill do a hunned nigga
Cuz I love you nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
