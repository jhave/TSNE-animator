[C-Murder]
Niggas (what?)
Would you ride for the cause? (hell yeah!)
Would you die for the cause? (fuckin right!)
How many niggas would ride and die for you? (we riders!)

My name manifest pain to my enemies 
Holler C-Murder and bring bitches to thier knees
Violent killers ready for blood marches 
Convicted murderers with open drug charges
Strapped with semi autos and po-po's
And nickle plated slug nose and we left the Calli cause
We made niggas, raised in ghetto's and slums
Totin chips and A-K's, money round drugs (ha)
Shoot first, and leave them standing in thier shoes
We TRU niggas, bounded by blood and tatooes
Infiltrating my click, fool it aint gonna happen
Us niggas been gettin paid before we started rapping
Situation getting sticky, cause the ???? the phone
Here comes the brigade, aiming straight for your home
Aint No Limit to the motherfucking thang, we a click
We rowdy, many niggas in the TRU click

[Chorus]
We riders
No Limit niggas
We riders 
We TRU niggas
We riders
We real niggas
We riders
We thug niggas (2X)

How many niggas wanna ride and get paid
I plan to sell a hundred million records in four days
Gangstas make the world go round
But TRU niggas make gangsta shit go down
We come in your set flip your dope and get rich
Take over your block and your spot with number one hits
Money and power, ha, give me the world
Cause after dollars no cents, only time will tell
Ha, I'm goin through somethangs, fool, so stop hatin
You live for weed and money, I live for greens and bacon
And I aint takin no shorts with my ghetto d
I stick to plan B and keep my eyes on my enemies
And if you want some nigga come and get some
We ride bourbans and llacs when its time to attack
So throw em up if you a real soldier
I'll make you say uhhhhh, I thought I told ya

Chorus 2X</pre>
