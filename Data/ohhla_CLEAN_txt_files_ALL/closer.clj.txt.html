Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Just pull up on you playin this
Yea
Not caring how you feel about it
Yea
You probably don't even know what it is
Yea

[Chorus]
Give it up
I'm a love it, boy, I won't you stop
(You don't stop)
Baby bring me closer
Take it off
I'm a love it, boy, I won't you stop
(You don't stop)
Bring it closer and closer

[Verse 1]
You was reminiscin and wishin
For L to deliver what the game's been missin
Beast that knock rhymes that lock with precision
Hot like when Pac first popped out of prison
Two schools of thought headed for a collision
Did it big for a minute then you lost yo vision
Skinny jeans, a wedgy and a dance rendition
Tycoons wouldn't choose that mission
These cats is all hyped, that's why I don't listen
I'm too tank fittin right, I see ya'll slippin
Ain't no hate love, nah I ain't trippin
Still love jewelry and champagne sippin
Bank roll healthy, ice is still sickening
Couldn't get fresh if you broke up, get slicking
We Diddy bop, ya'll out here skippin
Baby just ignore these fools, they trippin

[Chorus]
Give it up
I'm a love it, boy, I won't you stop
(You don't stop)
Baby bring me closer
Take it off
I'm a love it, boy, I won't you stop
(You don't stop)
Bring it closer and closer

[Verse 2]
Been with your Peewee Kirkland to Peewee Herman
Bishop Lamont, need to give em a sermon
How soon we forget when the chrome is turnin
Models in the backseat burnin
But even if I wasn't LL Cool J
I had the same girl that I have today
And that's not something most of these cats could say
Your whole hand's different than you're payin, a mistake
Now some of ya'll gonna feel some kind of weight
That's yo prop in which you, you know how we play
Grown, we're the bad, grinding all day
Fool, you got a edge when you take that away baby
The moment of truth and the jacuzz on
Like that news, play some rhythm and blues
Worry bout the water baby, leave on your shoes
Toast to the gold, my heart don't lose

[Chorus]
Give it up
I'm a love it, boy, I won't you stop
(You don't stop)
Baby bring me closer
Take it off
I'm a love it, boy, I won't you stop
(You don't stop)
Bring it closer and closer

[Verse 3]
LL  grown up man
Couldn't give a damn if a young boy's my fan
Long as his mama 2 step to my jam
While she cleanin up her house, mop in her hand
It's how I changed the game, now you understand?
I got that old money, weak rubber bands
Cats playin themselves, getting out of hand
Show two features to chase teenage fans
Well I got it right, I cram to understand
How you trendy shorty, L's a brand
Raised on hip-hop, the grownup fans
Hands in the air, rocking in a stance
I've been made, ain't no making of the bands
Save the techno and glow sticks for Disneyland
I'm sayin 5 features on every other jam
You like them? Listen to em, we don't give a damn

[Chorus]
Give it up
I'm a love it, boy, I won't you stop
(You don't stop)
Baby bring me closer
Take it off
I'm a love it, boy, I won't you stop
(You don't stop)
Bring it closer and closer

[Outro]
Aha, know what I mean?
So you can get yo 2 step on, you know?
It's what we love, you know what I'm sayin?
I'll love you, boy I won't stop
It's the music we love, you know what I mean?
You know?</pre>
