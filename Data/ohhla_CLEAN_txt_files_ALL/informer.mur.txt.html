[Intro: Wyclef Jean] (*Uncle Murda)
Everybody duck down (Uncle Murda in the area) (*East New York!!!)
Everybody duck down (Wyclef in the area)
Everybody duck down (Uncle Murda!!!!)
I bring the guns, your girl bring the roses, tonight
I bring the guns, your girl bring the roses, yeah!!!!!!!!

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean] (Uncle Murda)
Trigger happy them boys are trigger happy whoa (Trigger happy them boys are trigger happy oh)
Trigger happy them boys are trigger happy whoa (Keep your mouth closed or get hit up)
Informers! What we gonna do when we see them?!
Send them to the place where there be no breathin
Run and get sleep, eyes stay shut in the belly of the beast
Informers! What we gonna do when we spot them?!
Send them to the place where they be forgotten
Flesh get rotten, whoa!!! Out there in Brooklyn

[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
You know we don't play (Bang!!!)
If he rattin, the K  'gon clap him (Bang!)
I ain't sayin nothin to the police captain
Call me Stevie Wonder I ain't seen what happened
Call me the new B.I.G. call me the new Pac
If you see me poppin off just don't call the cops
Didn't your mother say don't tattletale?!
Now you dead she don't know if your in heaven or hell (Where you at!!!!?)
And now you can't take that back
Cause I put the chopper in your face and let it go BRRRRAAAPPPP!!! (Hit 'em up!!!!)
And I don't feel bad about what happened
Bloodclaat pussyhole him a rat bastard!!!!!!!!!

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean] (Uncle Murda)
Trigger happy them boys are trigger happy whoa (Trigger happy them boys are trigger happy oh)
Trigger happy them boys are trigger happy whoa (Keep your mouth closed or get hit up)
Informers! What we gonna do when we see them?!
Send them to the place where there be no breathin
Run and get sleep, eyes stay shut in the belly of the beast
Informers! What we gonna do when we spot them?!
Send them to the place where they be forgotten
Flesh get rotten! Mavado why don't you talk to the snitches!

[Verse 3: Uncle Murda]
Ain't that somethin?!
Homey told on junior and then your girl in your bed humpin (They humpin!)
That's why she ain't visit you
She was givin your stuff away to dude that snitched on you (AWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!)
She wasn't pickin up the phone (She wasn't)
Shorty thought you wasn't never comin home (Ever ever?!)
She don't know you out on bail
You got the word somebody put you on that you was in jail (You know what's goin on?)
So you open up the door to your house
You hear all this screamin that's dude blowin her back out
Go to the bedroom and get him up off her
Put a bullet hole in that battybwoy informer (Bang!!!)

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean] (Uncle Murda)
Trigger happy them boys are trigger happy whoa (Trigger happy them boys are trigger happy oh)
Trigger happy them boys are trigger happy whoa (Keep your mouth closed or get hit up)
Informers! What we gonna do when we see them?!
Send them to the place where there be no breathin
Run and get sleep, eyes stay shut in the belly of the beast
Informers! What we gonna do when we spot them?!
Send them to the place where they be forgotten
Flesh get rotten, whoa!!! Out there in Brooklyn
