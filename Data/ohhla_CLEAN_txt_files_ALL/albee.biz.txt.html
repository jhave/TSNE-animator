[ VERSE 1 ]
On the mic at this time in the place to be
I'm the Inhuman Orchestra called Biz Markie
That made you dance, make the music with my mouth, and all
But I'm here to talk about the Albee Square Mall
A place where people shop in downtown Brooklyn
Where I can be found if you're lookin
For me, the B-i-z, so just come check me out
Cause 24/7 I'm mikin the house
So when I come in the Mall, and then I start to roam
You wouldn't think it's a store, you would think it's my home
Cause when I come in the place, then I hang up a sign
Reads 'home sweet home' - this house is mine

Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall

I been to many malls from state to state
But I've never been in, say, one this great, I hate
To say, about the other shopping centers that's left
But the Albee Square Mall is the doo-doo-def
I be in there everyday, walkin around chillin
&gt;From when they opened all the way until when
It's about time for the place to close
I'm just running things like a pair of panty hose
They all know me, the Biz Markie
I get more respect than the average employee
Could work in every store in the mall
Because the place is my house from wall to wall
If I could move in, party people, I just might
So I could stay forever, and it won't be just like
A bum that you see sleepin on a park bench
So how will it be when you see Biz Markie
I fade them all, been havin fun
See, to me this mall is like number one
And any other shoppers that try to compare
There ain't no way they could hang out with Albee Square

My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall

I step in the place and shop around for a while
Buy some jewelry for Treny and Ali, and after that I'll
Go take a stroll inside of Gibb's Pups
Then buy some fresh silks, Bally's too
Next stop Olympic, wanted to buy some sneakers
Then hit the ??? room to pick me up a Cesar
Stroll around with a fly female
While security's riffin about leanin on the rail
After that I go eat some food at Wendy's
In the Albee cafateria, could be shoppin plenty
&gt;From store to store just stuff in my face
And I do the pfrr-one-two while sayin my grace
Finally I step off all alone
Up to the top level to use the telephone
Never use a quarter, cause I got a calling card
So I can reach out and touch everybody I know
That's where I be until the day is done
Just coolin in the place that's number one
So next time you'll be in Brooklyn walkin around
Play like _Price Is Right_ and 'come on down'
And
