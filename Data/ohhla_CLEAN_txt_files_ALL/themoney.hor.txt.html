[Intro: Foxy Brown]
Uh, what, c'mon
Foxy Brown, uh, Horace Brown, what, remix, uh

[Foxy Brown]
And y'all all see me, frontin' in a Z iced out
with all my Firm bino's nigga, bet we diced out and on the low
My steez, consists of three's and triple three's
and six figures of three's, and chromed SE's
Chillin' on the villa, stackin' my swilla
with a luga luga, the nine Rugar
Italiano, with some Columbian cats, bubblin' my stacks
The richest, Mr and Mrs, the double Browns

[Chorus: Horace Brown]
One for the money ("one, one, one one")
Two for the show ("two, two, two two ")
Three to get the honeys ("three, three, three three")
Here we go ("hit, hit, hit me")

One for the money ("one, one, one one")
Two for the show ("two, two, two two")
Three to get the honeys ("three, three, three three")
Here we go ("hit, hit, hit me")

[Verse One: Horace Brown]
M-O-N-E-Y, it's all good with me
Cause finally I can afford the life of luxury
And I remember in the day, mamma had to work so hard
just to pay, all the money spent, had to get another job

And now we're living in a (Eight room mansion, on the hill)
And we sippin' on (Sippin' on champagne, when we chill)
And we ridin' (Lex, Coupe, Beamers and the Benz)
All over the world (From the East to the West coast, makin' ends)
See, we do it

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Verse Two: Horace Brown]
It's true, it's what we live for
We love to sing, we gonna freak you up and down
It's how we do our thing
And to the ladies in the house tonight, lookin' fly
You got it right, it's gonna be an after party

And I've got to have somebody and take em to my
(Eight room mansion, on the hill)
We'll be sippin champagne (Sippin' on champagne, when we chill)
And we're ridin', ohh (Lex, Coupe, Beamers and the Benz)
All the playas from the East, to the West coast 
(From the East to the West coast, makin' ends)
Ohhh, this is why we do it

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Foxy Brown]
(Uh huh) Oh God I went from (uh) Avirex's and Goretex's (wha)
The Lexus's, nigga high beam chrome (word)
From bubble gooses to deuce juice, wha
From niggaz rockin' gazelles to bitches rockin' Chanel, wha (uh huh)
Now I keep my niggaz fresh
Genuine snakes and shit, plus the Firm keep me laced
Incognito, true baller
Ill Na Na, nigga, stay frontin' in Pah-rada, wha

[Horace Brown]
Why we sing, it's the joy it brings (why we sing, joy it bring)
You know that you like our style (reason why)
Reason why, we do what we do 

See we got a love for the music
Simple as one, two, three, sing it

[Chorus] - repeat til fade w/ ad libs </pre>
