I said I'm..
I'ma.. great white on the mic, servin fishscale
Livin life like I co-star with Denzel
Hip-hop been my life since kids meals
Lee jeans, label blocks and Big Wheels (uhh)
Ever since then I've been a FUCKIN problem
Feelin like Bruce Wayne, and this is Gotham
Now I got them haters watchin
Waitin for my next hit like a nigga boxin
(And the NEWWW~!) On this mic you can see I'm blessed
Some say I'm the +One+, like +KRS+
Shoutout to Clue, Flex and Doo Wop
R.I.P. Big L, Pun, Biggie and Tupac
Flow so sick somebody give me a flu shot (achoo)
I'm well done, overcooked, too hot
A booth, ProTools and a MP
That's all I need to show you that I'm a emcee (yessir!)
So you can chase the fame, cause simply
difference is, you a Beamer, I'm a Bentley - dummy!
Now wonder where I'd be without Funk Doc
So this toast goes to Redman and hip-hop (yo)

[Chorus: Ready Roc] + (Redman) + {Melanie}
Whattup Big Unc? (Whattup nephew?)
WHATTUP JERSEY? {Jersey, Jersey-ayyyyy}
(Check mic one) Check mic two
YEAH THEY HEARD ME..
How y'all feel? (Drinks on me!)
NOW WHO THIRSTY? {whoahhh-ohhhh}
(Cheers! This ones her for hip-hop)
HI-HI-HIP-HOP

[Interlude: Melanie Rutherford]
This is my life - this is my life baby
We gon' do it like this nigga

[Redman]
Yo, watch out now I talk like a old man
But still got that UHH like Jor-dan
Call in, anywhere I go it's CHEERS
Cause they yell my name like Nor-man
Walk in, look cool
Flow like the ink pen got Red Bull
Feel like I'm school, back to the basics
Handcuffin hip-hop, niggaz start rapin (yessir)
And I faced it, it's a new ballgame
It's like when +Baby Boy+ met Ving Rhames
Now that's so appealin, the veteran
still trappin, I'm back in the building
Yeah I laugh when I'm yakkin to children
But it's hard when ya boy lackin a million
I'm so brilliant, cause I work the Eastside
And do the same damn thing on the Westside (West coast!)
For hip-hop I'ma die - you fuck with it?
I'm O-Dog, I ain't lettin that shit ride!
Whoever outside with a eardrum
Old people, young people, here it come

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Melanie] + (Redman)
This is my life (yo, watch out now)
Hip-Hop (yessir, yo neph' I got it nigga)

[Redman]
Yo, aiyyo neph' you can tell I love hip-hop
And me stoppin any time? I think not
Whip, the opposite of a hard top
Summertime, my rhyme's in your droptop
Yeah, the LP is "Reggie"
I got the goods baby, I'm Don Ready
Ready, for any hip-hop freak
Even white chicks want black in 'em like Pernelli
Yeah, the rap game is star studded
It's like the NBA, you gotta love it

[Ready Roc]
Whattup Big Unc? Watch nephew
sell more records than Wyclef crew (ill)
Haters watch me ball like the ref do
And still can't get it right like a left shoe (hahahaha)
I'm 'bout to bubble like a Lex Coupe
"What's my motherfuckin name?" like I'm Big Snoop
Ready Roc hear the crowd scream
Now my name hold weight like a triple beam
Wu-Tang showed me how to get the C.R.E.A.M.
I'm a microphone, I'm a microphone fiend

[Chorus]

[Melanie Rutherford]
This is my life, this is my life
Hip-Hop, until I dieeeeee
Until I die, whoaaaaaa-ohhhhhh
Ooooo-hooo-hooooo
Cause this is my life, my life
Hip-Hop, until I diiiiieeee
Yeah yeah yeah</pre>
