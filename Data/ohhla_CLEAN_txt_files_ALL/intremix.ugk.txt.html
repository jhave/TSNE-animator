[Intro: DJ Paul]
Hypnotize Minds, UGK!
Three 6 Mafia, another classic baby
Put some South in your mouth
It's goin down, what!

[Pimp C]
Sweet Jones
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck for $40 in the club
Fuckin up the game, bitch ya gets no love
She be cross country, givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin lot we turn head
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy

{"Ohhhhhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhh I choose you girl, yeah..."}

[Bun B]
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World (world)
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl (girl)
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile (mile)
We pilin up the paper on the dinin room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable (fable)
We rock the freshest sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C, B-U-N B
Cause what's a hoe with no pimp? And what's a pimp with no hoes?
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get chose

{"Ohhhhhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhh I choose you girl, yeah..."}

[DJ Paul]
Now when they heard who in the club DJ Paul, bitches chosen up
When they see I'm icy like a slush, then they frozen up
Like my homie Project Pat we keep them cups raising up
Snizzow flizzake is off in my dollar, gotta nose it up
I dial drink by the liters, I'm a drinker hoe
Ya swore you doin it like meeee? Youse a thinker hoe
What you thinkin bro? Need to get your money way up
UGK and Three 6 Mafia got your girl trained up

[Juicy J]
I'm still trappin in hell, my pockets on swell
The number one D-boy, Mr. Fishscale
I don't fuck around, with snitches who tell
Put holes in your brain, leave bodies to smell
I'm out here gettin paid, ain't got time for jail
I paid off the judges, the juries, the sheriff
You know it's the Juice-man, never will fail
I'm still +Sippin' Syrup+, slow motion like snails

{"Ohhhhhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhh I choose you girl, yeah...
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh, I choose you baby..."}</pre>
