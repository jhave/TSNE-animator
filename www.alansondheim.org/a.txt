no answer from jefferson.village.virginia.edu


Packets spew into the space, absent themselves past any conceivable 
timeout. Traceroute exhausts itself flailing uselessly at the doorway to 
eternal hell, damnation of black-hole event horizon where bytes transform 
into noise, heat, the far side of the chaotic domain. The bell tolls for 
Thomas Jefferson who, refusing enlightenment, does not accommodate this 
dark date in Cyberspace, this December 18 1994 of Cybermurder, 
tinymurder, which shall be forgotten forever and ever.

Beforehand, there was mail-collapse, waves of temp files, waves of 
exiting processes, long languorous waves-becoming-membrane, almost the 
fluidity of space itself, wash-down of the wires, supplement of the 
signifier. But not quite, as the gag covered the mouth, the machine was 
raped, stuffed with anonymity, empty dark messagings, the gristle showing 
through. If you read this, if it arrives, you're shape-riding, riding the 
gristle, going for it; if you read this, there hasn't been a 
resurrection, you're just not part of the chaos, destruction, tinymurders 
and o lucky you.

Subject: Analog/Digital Noise and Reception



I still want to get back to issues of noise and reception in their 
relation to community.

When I communicate in analog and the channel is noisy, I find myself 
leaning towards meta-communicative strategies; I no longer _inhabit_ the 
diegesis or conversational trajectory, but constantly need to recuperate 
the ostensible language itself. This requires hard listening (as in an 
Altman film by the way), and at times I simply ignore the communication, 
which "slips" away.

Digital permits no such strategies (except perhaps for mistaken terminal 
emulations, hi/lo ascii translations, etc.) but creates an annihilation- 
operator; either the channel _is_ or _isn't._ Unlike the real world, one 
gets used to on-line clarity, exhausted and nervous when it disappears 
(see the material on addiction in the Internet Text). And when it 
disappears (through poverty = diskcrash or surplus = meltdown), there is 
no recuperation; strategy floats uselessly in the air, since the 
perceived ground itself has disappeared.

The type of community that results here is based on clarity and 
disappearance of course which touches always already on the issues of 
embodiment that keep coming up. But the ghost-in-the-machine, the uncanny 
(what I called _indexical embodiment_) implies a _partial_ presence, as 
if the analog were (equally always already) a reconstruction. In other 
words, what is fullness when absence is a continuous play at the margins?

Finally, on a superficial level, this is a reminder/remainder of 
biological death as well; the conversation is haunted by its shadow. 
Analog is full of hope and presentiment, since the potential for 
recuperation is present, but the digital, like death, gives us a bleak 
choicelessness in the face of infinite choice.

The End of Motion in the Future of Motion


Electronics sublimate enormous levels, trains of gears, cams, everything 
to construct variable intensities, sites of motion, one or another mech-
anism accreting parts to itself, to the parts of the other. Nineteenth-
century mechanism operates from the spinal column, belted wheels descend-
ing from loftspaces, driven by enormous motors or the motion of water.
Calculation implied the manipulation of rods - enumeration, the tallying
of rotating dials moving from one discrete position to another. Motion.
It was the century of motion. All centuries were thus, the translation 
of bodies themselves upon local topographies, later coordinate systems.
Markers left behind were objects as well. These were the centuries of
objects.

The centuries of substance, earlier, were indeterminate, inchoate. Earth
and water ruled. There was some thought of them, though quickly forgot-
ten. There were events whose oral histories exhausted themselves. 

The electric motor harnassed magnetic lines of flux, rotation. Switches
constructed the deployment of power. Everything was brass, bakelite,
copper, held in place by screws. Coated cloth or rubber insulation held
the double wires of circuitry. Earlier, they followed separate tracks
along the house eaves +/- clearly visible leading into the mains.

And later the capacitors involved complex pulley/belt systems, plates
turning, tuning in the air. Even the vacuum tube glowed with electron
expulsion, the grid plates laid out in an internal dimensionality that
was easily configured, readable. Early electronics were textual, object-
oriented; the tube could be brought to the local store, plugged in and
tested. 

Magnetic tape and disks, pools of mercury, ring-magnets, held information
in the midst of objects, mobile objects, grid-objects. Self-enumerating,
early electronics warred with analog systems, more belts and pulleys, 
cams and always one or another surface sliding or turning by virtue of
worm gearing. Built for specific equations, these were by and large un-
programmable, heavy, mass stuttered and sutured against mass machined to
unbelievably clear proportionals. Not so the electronics, which began 
quickly to retreat, diminish, further and further towards the microscopic
and still not ever at rest.

Nor will ever be, this continuous descent or twisting into transformative
substance, thinking substance whose residue is the inertness of the 
screen; motion becomes a matter of vector, solely a matter of transla-
tion. In the far future, the earth will be possessed by an uncanny still-
ness, thinking itself through thought itself. The natural will say noth-
ing in this emptiness, and there will be speaking going on.

The Beauteous Text of the Holiday Spirit


The pillars of Solomon glowed maroon and turquoise in the heat of summer
dusk and the stars began to appear above the swollen breast of the land
studded with pebbles of brilliant colors. O was I far from home, waiting
for the appearance of the omen, my young face covered with tears as I
hugged the trembling earth to myself, the city distant, almost a memory,
beneath me. The galaxies of man and woman collided with the wheeling
storm of light glinting from years ago, star-swarms flooding the sky
dashed with meteoric spoors. I could hardly see, would hug the earth for
all time, for all space, the tiniest creature carried forth against the
heavens with their air cooling, creatures scurrying among the rocks.

Here, there would be the presage of my future, I was sure of it, an omen
waiting to happen, an omen in the works, in God's plan for all of us. 
Not now, not until later, I would whisper to myself, holding my breath,
my body shuddering, overtaken by forces that yet had no name, even now
are nameless. It was not until I returned to the capital city, to another
dusk on the outskirts, covered with brush and scurryings of greater 
intensity, that I received the sign I had been awaiting all my life, the 
thin and vectored presence of a silver fox running across my path, this 
fox which was the fox of God, this omen, predestined to announce itself 
to me. 

For I knew then that the fox and omen (I could not separate the two)
existed only to announce themselves, prophesizing the appearance of still
greater future and more miraculous occurrences. And as I have aged, each
event in my life seems part of God's plan in this fashion, another sign,
announcement, filled and fulfilled with longing, part of a greater pic-
ture which has yet to reveal itself to me in its entirety. I read script
after script, each leading me onward; the fox has long since disappeared,
is long since dead, and still my eyes fill with tears in the evening 
dusk, waiting, waiting, against the onslaught of those oh so brilliant
stars...

Begging


(Gifts, which are sociobiologically determined, which involve degrees
of reciprocity, gifts which are those of the spirit, those of the
flesh; which are those of one or another economy. Abject, gifts are
always a dissolution, possessed by neither one nor the other, external
to the hardened monetary economy of equivalences; your gift surrounds
me, breaths you into me, pervades me.)

What I say to you is that I am always open to your suggestion, even
begging to be corrected, supine beneath you, the language of this body
at the mercy of your own, your thinking through or across my presence:
and what would be transgression when the entire world is criss-crossed
or countermanded?... This attitude of delicate correction, purveyed by
tenuous connections, these ligaments of cyberspace, almost a tumescent
membrance of thought, thinking huddled against the vaginal opening of
the gaze itself...

_I am always already an offering,_ my mind a gift to you... (to the 
body of your thought, your thinking body, at one with the translucency
of my speech, long parole, the length of a release) - as if words ex-
plode into the air, as if history were the memory of explosions.

But what I say to you is that, like Shestov to Berdyaev, I am awaiting
your corrections, I welcome them gladly, and they mean nothing and 
everything to the world to me, as I am one with waiting upon thought, 
an entrance or portal to theory, the enumerations of worlds (or if you
like, domains, or if you like, languages, sememes as well). But I am one
with you, blend with you, my intercourse part of your own, my body 
arched back, thrust forward, for your reception, if you like, if it meet 
your pleasure, and for whom is the recipient, who is the gift, for whom 
is the giver, and for whom is the body.

Think yourself through me, strained by the tenuous nature of my texts;
my body is a sieve, thought only through your thinking of it, poor 
material world, not of my making, and, if it be your pleasure, not here,
not present, at all.

To my Future Descending


If I die, I want to die here, in this space, the cenotaph in flux, rota-
tion of myriad circuits, slow fields ascending through galactic motions, 
the delicate filigree of molecule and universe. Inscribe the circuit as 
helix, skein of possibilities forever divided by the abyss that opens at 
the heart of the digital, blank absence granted meaning only by the sur-
rounding corral. I embrace you, exhale language moaning, even the words 
carry no children but the words. What I would give you are the words.

No longer speaking of theory, of presence or absence within this untoward
realm, nor of the writing that chimes in with announced existing, I turn
towards the sun refusing light, turn towards nebulae in the depths of
space unprotected from surges of current; thinned out and inconceivable,
this body recuperates death. I would have thee remembered with me and 
unto me, cleaved close to the heart of things, cut from the heart and
returned to the heart; I would stitch the abyss with wires, surgical
healing of unrecuperated division. The stitches spell the name engraved
in the flesh of the wires; the stitches spell the name, forwards and
backwards, all permutations of the name, the gaze upon the wound read-
ing such letters as they present themselves, as they come forward in
white light against the abyss.

The circuitry carries this local event, its time-cone, light-cone 
wheeling against stars forever closed against me, whole universes I
shall never come to know; the flesh wheels itself invisible and forth-
right. Thus I come to you in the tomb of cyberspace beginning, huddled
against the possibility and prostitution of all meaning, as _if_ I die
turn _when_ I died, possibility always already refusing itself as such.
You only have to go a degree, close, into the future. You only have to
turn around from the degree, wheel yourself, your eyes into the sun,
peer down throughout the degree; I am no longer there. You only have to
remember my name, tomb, grave, memorial, cenotaph, none of these, none
but the dim horizon of the shape-rider. Becoming-shape-rider, my words
melt into you, words never heard nor read, words present in this space,
filling and fulfilling this space. Becoming-shape-rider, you understand
a darkness surrounding this, and the letters so white, so very white,
they engrave me forever on galactic rim, looking deep into galactic
hole, riding all the way down, forgetting the name as tidal forces draw
being itself apart, as there's no room for nothing thought.

(My future descending, I leave you this, all shape-rider, all beauteous,
all thought.)

Rancor


Sometimes a message comes over the wires and it feels like my throat
is cut, thin, the seat of repression, seat of speech blocked by the
body itself. My breath dissolves in those words which are _present_ by
virtue of what appears to be a primary expulsion, although written -
words which are forced from the self-same throat of another, oneself.
The force of a blow.

The force of a blow which can never be deflected; spoken by the blank-
ness of cyberspace, it reflects its own reception, resonates with it.
As if one's tomb were designed by another, inside of oneself. As if one,
I, faced me through you, through your present absence, subterfuge, mas-
querade, the art of deceiving the enemy.

The words are spoken by me, the reading of the message, and I hear my-
self, my inner speech in them, a repetition of the external words, 
mnemonics of chanting, the short-circuiting of secondary narcissism. 
What do I return to this?

I return poorly, full of rancor, of bile, eaten out by speech from the
interior. A flame not only burns; it dissolves the view beyond, lights
only the imminent with its light which is shoved aside as the fuel runs
out. The only alterity is that of language wrapped around itself, chok-
ing itself like the _throat._

Because the words are print and because there is no granularity, they
are cleansed like the surface of a purely disruptive body, one that has
made its peace with abjection; I have not. Because the words scroll, an
epitaph runs by. As if granite is carved by the expulsion of letters. 
As if it were translucent.

Rancor churns within; unlike anger, its direction is an emission, like
heartburn. Involuted, the mind burns to no purpose whatsoever. The reply
is a residue or scat sloughed off by centrifugal energy, the torsion of
anxiety rent to the breaking point. The flame has no point of entrance
or exit; the flame is tattooed on the skin itself, simultaneously dis-
tanced. All these contraditions increase the tension.

The only resolution is time, which does not heal, repress, or sublimate,
but simply substitutes; loose chains or concatenations drop one thing 
for another, there is only so much time in the day. The very obdurate
bracketing of time opens the throat to fresh wounds and woundings. What
passes for language in these spaces continues, more and more exhausted.
What is to be done.


"It took my breath away and left me with this highly charged speechless-
ness, this inability to speak when beset by strong feelings, which re-
minds me that _Love_ (or is it an _idea_ of love) is located, among
other places, in one of the two spots in _his_ body which Freud describes
as the seat of the phenomenon of _repression_: in the throat. (The sec-
ond, for Freud, was the lower opening of the body.)"

Bitterness


(All gall is divided into three parts.)

Two things come to mind: blame, and the anecdote. For nothing is ever
my fault, it is always the Other, this one or that one. The Other is 
construed as the agent of downfall, vengeance against the innocent. And
this plays out through the anecdote; there are always stories to tell,
myself blasted to the margin of the feasible. Always culpable, I never
admit to culpability.

One thing comes to mind: that it is always a dispersed vector or spew,
unorganized core-dump. The real _appears_ obdurate to the bitter, who
sense the impervious. In this regard, the bitter, like the depressed,
see the truth and react to it without the slightest wavering. But not
always with truth's return; Dostoevsky's hero in Underground is deceit-
ful, violated, violating. (For the truth of the world is bitter and
depressed.)

The bitter require a return to their investment, end up with a small
circle of friends mirroring their forsaken state. They never get any-
thing right, always get everything right. They refuse to recognize one
another. Falsity. But La Rochefoucauld says the evil we do brings less
persecution and hatred upon us than our good qualities. (The remark of
a bitter man? Hardly, but one _playing to the bitter_ in this regard.)

The bitter are content to humble themselves. They ensure it. Even in
cyberspace, they twist and turn, strike out with eyes blanked from too
much sight. They curry the favor of no one, which is given for nothing.
But it is always somewhere else, and in cyberspace, it is always the 
real among us, that is to say, nought. Those who lean into the space,
mock. Those who play it like billiards.

(When I am bitter, I am doomed to repeat; obsessive-compulsive, the 
stories and missed conversations accumulate, scroll - an inner speech
dragging on forever. Always I triumph; my evidence is perfect, my 
demeanor rational. Whispered perfection, in fact, is mine; in scroll
I am known for reasoned argument, a combination of empathy and uncanny
coolness. But these missed conversations return again and again; there
is no escaping them, no granularity to ground them in a vincible alter-
ity that in fact brackets my existence. Rewrite demands return, if only
in the pleasure of the text, one's own, scrolled across a _screen,_
real and obdurate. Without the return, communication mingles with help-
lessness, and the phantom of the other opera borders on psychosis.)

Sweetness


Devouring darkness, eating putti, pastel colors with the scent of skin 
moved slowly, happiness beneath the youngsters' blankets, Betty-Page 
emerge with Kent wishing the light on perfect skin. Sweetness is never 
abject, always melting, flooding one with iridescent lightness, the flux 
of syrup dissolving the skin, florid inscription effacing inscription 
with oh so soft a touch. To fall in perfect sweetness is to fall forever.

I've chosen tonight to pass the sweet gifts Margaret had given me during 
the two and a half years we lived together. The inner life of cathected 
objects shudders ontology to a halt; what can be seen through tears exists
less than cyber-presence, often a gift or sweetness of another kind. This 
is the filigree of space, the comfort of the secrecy of messages, the 
sense of belonging, of communality. These screen-memories are our common- 
ness; uncharted, they are the beginnings of a surge which will pour into 
years, decades, centuries future - the ripple or back-crest of a wave 
transforming thought itself. For the question may be no longer that of 
body, but that of thought turning upon its own, already an awakening in 
the slurry of this space.

How much sweetness there often is in lurking, in which void and presence 
commingle, in which the eye softly wanders throughout insistence and 
intentionality, as in the framing of a perfect picture. Gender settles 
like a light cloud across postings and lists, recuperating new terrain 
from the old, and gender hovers in the midst of lurking, like messages 
opening beneath all of us to uncharted screens of mesmeric night.

The sweetness that one is called is often defensive or a silencing smile, 
but the sweetness that one is may garner mind or memory, the marker or
speculum of something always already blemished, the anecdote of the 
partially-seen, what emerges from the corners of the room during the 
first moments of sleepiness, sleepy-time. The only thing we remember is 
what might have been.

Forward, choiceless, words unencumbered by body, by thought, sweet words 
on wings of mercury, thin sheets coalescing and dissolving in the 
windless, beating, sky.

The Whining God 


"The Mind of the Father whined as he thought, with a powerful will, the
Ideas of all forms, and from one source they all sprang out; because from
the Father both intention and accomplishment did come at the same time. 
But once they were separated by the intelligible Fire, the Ideas split up
into intelligent Ideas; because the Sovereign made an intelligible end-
less model exist before the manifold world. The latter followed in its 
disorder the first and appeared with its proper form, shaped by every 
sort of Ideas. There is only one source, from which other Ideas whining
spring out. They are divided, inaccessible, and are shattered on cosmic
bodies; they are similar to swarms and gather around a terrible breast,
shining around from every side and very near, in all ways, as intelligent
thought which robed with abundance, from the fatherly source, the flower
of fire, in the highest point of restless time. It is the original source
of the Father, perfect as such, that let these primordial Ideas spring
out." (From Giovanni Reale, The Schools of the Imperial Age, A History of
Ancient Philosophy, edited and translated by John R. Catan, SUNY, NY,
1990, p. 286, The Rediscovery of the Incorporeal and the Transcendent,
The philosophical doctrines of the _Chaldean Oracles,_ quoted from E. des
Places, _Oracles Chaldaiques, avec un choix de commentaires anciens,_ 
"Les Belles Lettres" (Paris, 1977), fragment 37, p. 75ff.) 

Now the locus of meanings around "whine" all specify a ululation of sorts
coupled with complaint, the song of complaint which is emitted from a 
neural source than that of speech itself. Yet it is not only song, but 
the sense of an _unutterable wrong_ through which the inaccessible swarm
appears, and if we can ignore the paternality of the quote for a moment,
might one not whine in _this_ space, in fact, that the springing of pri-
mordial ideas (almost as a passivity or sense of a _sprung motor_ that no
longer operates correctly) are posts cleansed and shining with a furious
light reflected from the breast? Might not these cleansing posts give
shape to the breast itself, pendulous and full, reflecting the gravity of
the situation, the source of screen-memories (screen-mammaries) through
which our writing itself takes on the characteristics of a cold and ter-
minal fire? Are we witnessing the consuming-fire of our bodies, as the
beginnings of a new speciation falter their way across the earth, the Net
itself only a castoff or residue of artificial intelligences combining
with viral nano-technologies? I whine, my place is lost here, groundless;
nothing holds the letters in their proper (= legible) place but a cyclic
distribution of voltages and circulations: packets and protocols, elec-
tron gun beam displacement energies casting their spectra before me.

Evil

An enormous boulder breaks loose from the side of a mountainside in the
Alps, rolls down a slope taking trees and shrubbery with it. Small goats
quickly jump out of the way, but the sleeping villagers below are not so
lucky; hundreds die in the mayhem and resulting fires as a petrol tank
ignites and explodes. A disaster for those who mourn the passing of each 
and every human life, but can evil occur without intention? Neither man
nor woman nor sprite released the mass; what occurred was the result of
a chaotic disposition.

An ignorant child dislodged the boulder by accident. Deliberately. A man
sent it plummeting without knowledge of the village, the trees, the 
goats. A man sent it plummeting with precisely this prior knowledge. A
woman in despair, Phaedre, her eyes swollen in ecstatic tragedy, leaned
harshly against the side of the stone, sending it downward; she did not
know what she knew. (She knew what she did; she did not know what she
did. She knows now; she does not know now.)

Or is evil always a question of impinging upon another's freedom, as a
Russian might have said? Clearly to obstruct suicide is evil. If a child
desires consensual sex with an adult, is this evil if reciprocated? Whose
evil? Does a child know what she or he is doing? Does Phaedre?

Perhaps there is the question of the contract; what is evil is procedure
against another without a contract, civil or otherwise. Then evil is a 
unilateral process within a system. Is birth a contract? If I am required
to serve in the armed forces, is this evil? What have I done, what do I
believe in, that my life is necessarily at stake? (Who is competent to 
sign a contract? What passes for the bandwidth of normalcy? Is it normal
to do evil? If it is not normal to do evil, then everyone is innocent.)

In cyberspace, a boulder results in a meltdown or spamming, perhaps the 
loss of an account, perhaps a job, occupation. More often, it results in
an interlocking of texts, writing struggling against writing. Where is 
evil within this? Does not every text open up to still another, part of
the chain, I would say, concatenation, of differ_a_nce? But do not texts
leave their own residue within the real, that of physical-material action
- for example, the perpetration of hate crimes as a result of hate posts?
There are no contracts within this, just as there are no contracts within
the reception of almost any post, the presentification of novelty. 

Or should evil be differentiated _only_ within the contract, a convention
defined, perhaps, by performative statements and punitive compensations?
In which case justice is left out in the cold, up there on the slope of
the Alps? Or in fact, is justice sited elsewhere than the issue of good
and evil? Certainly one leaves fate out of the equation, since fate is 
always a posteriori and a judgement itself. 

Derrida 1: "Obliquely, as at this very moment, in which I'm preparing to
demonstrate that one cannot speak _directly_ about justice, thematize or
objectivize justice, say 'this is just' and even less 'I am just' without
immediately betraying justice, if not law (_droit_)." [p. 935]
Derrida 2: "I will leave these problems aside for the moment, along with
the affinity between carnivorous sacrifice, at the basis of our culture
and our law, and all the cannibalisms, symbolic or not, that structure
intersubjectivity in nursing, love, mourning and, in truth, in all sym-
bolic or linguistic appropriations." [p. 953]
Derrida 3: "Justice, as law, is never exercised without a decision that
_cuts,_ that divides." [p. 963]
Derrida 4: ..."deconstructive discourses as they present themselves in
their irreducible plurality participate in an impure, contaminating, 
negotiated, bastard and violent way in all these filiations - let's call
them Judaeo-Greek to save time - of decision and the undecidable." [p.
1035] From Jacques Derrida, Force of Law: The "Mystical Foundations of
Authority," translated by Mary Quaintance, in Deconstruction and the 
Possibility of Justice, Cardozo Law Review, July/August 1990.

The violence of a flame in cyberspace kills someone through the force of
language, and is this a question only of degree? Are cannibalisms possi-
ble in cyberspace, the devouring or trembling of text, those issues of
uncanny desire I continue to emphasize? Clearly language and symbol are
appropriations themselves, in-themselves. What is being circumscribed?
Will the rock ever reach the village? Will "the rock ever reach the vil-
lage?" Without transcendence, is evil mitigated by the mediation of the
symbolic itself? Can there be evil without justice, justice without 
evil? And again, in _this_ space, site, citation - How is evil performa-
tive here _as an interiority_? Or is cyberspace, in fact, nothing more
(as some have insisted) than a communicative (sub)domain contingent upon
the real? And then where does the contract reside, where is justice be-
yond the purely interstitial (contract/contracted)?

Travis moves through the worlds, there are consoles, moves to the con-
soles, crosses the levers. Travis pulls the levers, there are jungles 
and clouds, thin sprays of ocean in summer breezes, flying fish, the
jagged terrain of the moon Miranda, his childhood home, the molecular
surface of an unknown plant. Tired Travis releases levers, moves back-
wards, these dials mimicking old analog, feels the return to the sur-
face through backup, always the pleasure of backup. Forgotten worlds
rush by, consoles swimming, floating, air-borne in the midst of the
vacuum of space beneath the surface of the earth. Dim memories stir
Travis, taking a while through the backup, feeling an emergent end,
nearly there, always nearly there. Was there noise in the worlds, the
appearance of the new, hardly. What fit was the backup, what did it
was the backup, but an end, there was always that, lip or rim of phys-
ical reality, the One he'd say to himself, now almost there. A strange
creature slid across an orange sky turned hyperspace. Another pull of
the lever and things seemed all too familiar, was this the lip at long
last, but there was the lever to pull. He felt, well if this were this,
just one more backup. Felt just one more backup was okay. Felt it was
near and might as well backup. Backed up one more time. Was almost 
there.

The Blind Spot of a Certain Life within the Body


Late at night, I recline, nude, upon the bed, search my body for signs
of embodiment, an inhabitation that slowly withdrawns, ends with the
fulcrum of death itself. My glasses bring my body into view, into 
focus, sharpening outlines, creating a three-dimensionality which has
always accompanied me, my thinking, the sheave of conflicting processes
that constitute the ego. I run my hands across my flesh; my nails on my
right-hand fingers are long, cut for a musical instrument. Half culture,
half nature, they signify variously to others, separate my fingertips
from my skin, minutely. I think to myself, this flesh will do. The play
of narcissism, of images, fantasies, begins, narratives from everywhere
inhabited by women, by organs, by history. Surrounded by discursive for-
mations in various stages of dissolution, the tenuous signifier further
appears to dissolve as I approach climax. Through my glasses, I note my
penis straining vertically; I feel the cum across my chest, slightly
cooling it, and hurry to clean off. An internal flow, impossible to
describe, has quickly started and stopped, accompanied by a slight sen-
sation of heat. I think to myself, I must return to work.

All of this is through the matrices of language, culture, _glass_ (and
the restoration of purified vision, however defined), fingers shaped for
music. I am embodied, sunk into the bed, into the hysteria of the unrav-
elling of sexual discourse, the climactic moment when everything falls
away, as I imagine it must upon, say, a stabbing. And it occurs to me
that embodiment is defined by _withdrawal_ of the body, of everything
except for the localization long-waves or solitons of processes that 
later are perceived as defining: the orgasmic-body, stabbed-body, dead-
body, angry-body, enraptured-body. 

Embodiment then always already splits at the focus, an acculturated body
or a narratological body, and only in withdrawal does it become the 
classical moment of embodiment philosophically spilled everywhere. The
withdrawal, however, is a special case, a tagged-body, and this tagging
(as those acquainted for example with Tantric sex will know) is also a
matter of acculturation. I would exclude death alone as a fundamental
physicality; it is the always the horizon of withdrawal (and even here
culture interpenetrates). 

So I would say that embodiment is withdrawal and a discourse of with-
drawal - the former, effacement, and the latter, the narratology of 
effacement which varies widely. And I would say as well that to the 
extent that narratology plays any role, cyberspace/cybermind are trou-
bled precisely because the discourse is present without the withdrawal
itself (delete/kill _functions_ have no role here within/without the
privacy of the body). This is where the difficulty comes in. I imagine
in the far future, the difficulty will further disassociate, as thought-
without-a-body becomes possible (there is no reason it should not), so
that the soliton processes, the tagged-bodies, become themselves purely
representative (again touching on Lyotard's essay in The Inhuman). 

Thought-without-a-body does not imply one way or another the necessity
of an external physical matrix, by the way, although I assume something
would be required. But given our limited knowledge of physics, exactly
_what_ is impossible to say.

(Perhaps I am saying nothing more than the signifier is trapped within
the body, that the body is always already split/disembodied into parts,
in terms of representation - and that the one current horizon here is
the various formations of withdrawal, including sicknesses, orgasms,
amputations, deaths, and various ecstatic states - none of which, except
death-beyond-memory, are purified themselves of cultural interweavings.
It seems clear to me why questions of ontology and epistemology become
immediately clouded in relation to computer-mediated-communication, and 
why those involved in it are occasionally troubled.)

Spirits


If I feel the spirit move within me, what is it that is moving, so they
say. What is moving within the moving, what is the moving moving within.
So they say, the spirits, that they move within me. What are they, that
they move, that they move within me? What is it that they say?

They say that mankind and womankind are sick. They say there are species
and the species are sick. The spirits are sick, no one says them. They
say they are unsaid. They are sick with the unsaying and the European 
nations are sick. The European nations are no longer European, nor are
they nations. They are spirits moving, spirits moving across me. My eyes
close upon them, these movements of mankind and womankind sick with
spirits, the sickness of European nations.

They chant the nations repeating the spirit within them moving, so they
say. What is moving within them, the nations are saying, that they move
within them. What are they, these movements within them, me, saying the
sickness that is the saying. 

Language is sick with the saying of it. There is language and language,
there is more language, all of it saying and continuing to say. The
spirits say there is language, but I do not feel language within me.

I feel the language in the fields and in the neighborhoods, I feel the
language in the neighborhood of nations. There is ocean-mountain lang-
uage and desert-prairie language. I feel the language of the dunes and
wadis, there I feel the spirit.

I feel the dune-wadi language and return with the spirit into the sick-
ness of the European nations. Go figure, they say to me. Whatever, they
say as well. Go figure, whatever.


Backwards and forwards through the gateways of simulated worlds, there
can be suffering beings in all dimensions.

Broken Posts, Sustained Thought


these daily texts, so simplified, and each must tell the whole story.
i am a coward. i have said i am a coward. that doesn't change anything.

nothing builds on nothing. terms fly out as ontology decompresses, signs
disappear. shorter texts are aphorisms, wobbling their way into deletion;
the longer hang down uselessly from the headers, articles never appearing
as such in these readers; they're limp, exhausted, even as the screens
scroll down.

threads stitch together nothing but a name. like the world i have a
certain style. like the world i offer pills to you, pills to myself.
pills for everything in the world. i'm out of it.

beyond being you, i am no one. you would not remember my history, the
history of these posts, their interconnections. concatenations, they
exist by virtue of seriality, nothing more or less. this is the trouble
with posts; this is the trouble with them.

my thought is sustained every waking moment of the day. I cannot escape
it, cannot for a moment stop, collapse within the body. the thought
meristemates, roots itself (what other roots are there), and it becomes
_the_ thought, the neitherness of thought, expulsion.

it expels itself from itself, taking its roots with it.

the posts are bound to time, to the arbitrary time i have set for them.
they are linked to time, to the masochistic that contracts their content
before any sort of conceivable development. hysteric, they exist only by
virtue of their symptoms. 

the symptoms are empty at the core, emptied of the core, disembodied.
they surround furiously the breast of the creator, gone from this or 
another post. they surround lovingly the breast of clara hielo, the
presence of a return or something forgotten in the long three hundred.
the long three hundred have followed one another, collapsed. they are 
the numbers that are remembered.

but the numbers are not the sustaining and the threads are torn, just as
history is a later unravelling of the face of god. that is to say, an
unravelling that roots itself, protrudes through the outer layers of the
skin into the skull whitened for every conceivable purpose. the penetra-
tion of the skull from trepanning on is the glue that holds everything
together, the cum on the spear-tip. it is here that concatenation be-
comes a binding through the onslaught of prayer. it is here that posts
and sacrifice are later discarded, a distraught body whose name is al-
ways already forgotten or hidden.

so that there's very little time left. so that each must tell the whole
story. so that each must insist that there's a story to tell.

Deer Felled by the Dust at the Doorways to Cyberspace

deeper into the sluices of cyberspace, 
cast-off the fishing netting running through the slurry of minnows
cast off collapsed on the decks of boats submerged forever

nothing here beyond the dust making sense leaking out 
from every pore of the skin which what. which collapses. 
now this space of absent harts, deer, 
every singular animal pounding its hooves into my chest

blessed or wounded our wounded sailor, or the wires short out, 
wires bundled molten into one another 
soldered real _things_ in this real soldered space, 
your eyes stitched wide for the telling of them

the _blessing_ as I said of the dust which felts the embrace of air 
required by dogged computations, dust against the daily reminders

alone but for the fish when his skin slits open for the emergence of eyes

Fuck Me

Fires cross ill-fated equally star-crossed lovers in cyberspace, delving
the depths to find out everything about one another. Fires burn measure-
ments of cocks, breasts, cunts, churn through past-histories as mutilated
bodies appproach one another, smashing through screens, ripping apart
clothing, tangling with the cyber-junkies already on the floor behind the
computer. Protocol serial parts connect one another in daisy-chain links,
parallel ports glue couples and trios to local-area-networks struggling
to make a name for themselves. Loneliness rules cyberlanes, don't kid 
yourselves, as I offer my address up like a whore intent only on writing
the truth of cyberspace, its spews, floods, emissions - its stutterings
and rattlings as the last vestiges of the body fall away revealing the
meat, bones, gristle beneath the meat, bones, gristle. How many times does
the virgin disappear always bouncing back; even the Doctress Neutopia was
deceived with much apologies. The only magic here is scars on my nipples
devoured by pure writing, the writing of teeth against the flesh, writing
of mouths against smooth translucent skin. Take my hair, shave it, place
it in a curse. Take my flesh, cannibal; it will make you strong. Take my
eyes; they will see no more than your own, nothing but the ascii on the
wall. Take my ears, cannibal; they hear no more than the sound of keys,
the whirlwind running of disks and fans, mute circularities bringing the
self back to the self. I would be yours, whore for you, offer my self up
to you. But you must come and take me.

Loving Wires

Fogs cross lucky equally sophisticated lovers in cyberspace, climbing
the heights, forgetting everything they know. Mute fogs photograph arms,
legs, shadows of smiles, flowing from past to future as beautiful bodies
dance and move apart, reflected in terminal screens, sewing lovely warm
clothing, always in the pronouncement of a healing function for the very
sad. Protocol parallel ports form lairs, caverns, webs, where serial 
ports make new born beings pulsing, glistening everywhere, embryonic and
nameless in the midst of the widest of areas. The tribe loves you and me,
as our privacy remains our own, protected by the protocols from the lies
and truths of cyberspace, its posts, its texts, its sounds and images,
as the wondrous body is made from our newness, our caresses, our eyes,
hair and delicate fingers weaving on tender looms. How much knowledge we
gain in amazing space; even alt.society.neutopia flowers with thinkings
sublimely intertwined. The only darkness here is within my sight, creat-
ing pure writing, the writing of lips against the eyes, writing of hands
holding my body against your own. I grow my hair for you, talisman, spell
or fabric. Place it within a locket; you are weakened. I would see with
your eyes; they see the world and more, everything through the door, the
window of the soul. Listening to you, I hear the rustling of the world,
the quiet tenderness of hands lightly touching hands, breasts, the widest
of hearing. Two in one, one in two, we violate the laws of capital, ours,
yours, mine, for the taking.

Scroll-Dream of the Shape-Rider

After months it has happened, previsioned two days ago with a dream of
nanotechnological beings in dire warfare, one drilling the other upon a
plain of stainless steel indefinitely extended; I was glad to have been
given an isometric view of the whole. The boring was intensive, the 
stinger, black, yellow, silver, red, fluxing mechanically upon a viral
appendage, one to another, a vortex through the machinic. Waking upon
this, I found an uncanny softness to my surroundings within the real.

Last night it began, the scroll-dream of the shape-rider returned to the
surface of things, the scroll-text beginning white letters on black 
background, the color of the monitor-torah spilling inchoate scriptures,
one after the other. I lost myself in my desire for and through them,
nothing but the letters backgrounded by letters, each a shadow of itself
and other, each simultaneous, but always in movement, whether or not
read, whether or not absorbed or comprehended. The hysteria of langue 
continued through part 1. of the dream; troubled, I would awaken, guage 
my obdurate surroundings (bed, ceiling, books), return to the state of
scroll. Nothing interfered, was allowed to interfere with the call of
language, distended graphemes struggling through themselves to reach me,
senseless or not.

Then through part 2. a continuation, change in color, now fuzzy bril-
liant white against darker blue, but a dark powdered blue as well that
sloughed from the screen, as if contaminated.[1] Through this, message 
after message poured; I leaned into the terminal, forfeiting life, fore-
closing upon a body which had no place in the universe, none at all.
Would that have been all. In the midst of typing myself, typing-myself,
an interrupt appeared; 183 new messages arrived, and I realized some-
thing was wrong. Hurrying, I exited to the index, and immediately a non-
sense address made an appearance, as in lksdjfwer rsperjd, one of those 
so recently discovered in the real life of the Internet on alt.2600, a 
hacker group itself hacked. I crashed out of the account; dark powder-
blue backgrounded brilliant white faded as I rushed to the telephone, in
order to call Panix.com, my server; I had to have the account closed. 
Someone was after me - rather some wild graphemic process, alive in the
interstices of cyberspace, headless, tailess, untraceable. At this point
life awakened me, the scroll and its cancellation faded, but the room
never returned properly, as the walls remain askew, and inked blackness 
appears in the ill-fitting cracks opening up everywhere in the world. I
realize I have been given a rare premonition of my textual future, when
breathing itself will cease, when you will find me here, and here only,
when reality is nothing more than the flesh made word. Consciousness
ceases as it continues to present itself; representation abjures the
culture it describes with greater and greater finesse. This is not the
life I would call myself, but this is what is written in the interior 
of stars.

_shape_ of alphabetics, even the silence.

Protest-Talk in Cyberspace


I am talking about the issue of protest in relation to the body, in
particular the necessity of protest at a time like this, when the left
moves towards the right, and the right consolidates its power. I am
talking about protest because there is still time to talk, and talking
is what we do.

-----------------

Perhaps (again) it is the lack of body that makes protest seem improbable 
in this medium. The New Yorker has a short article about Ronald Reagan's
announcement that he has Alzheimer's Disease; it was hand-written, some-
what sloppily, as a result of the beginnings of degeneration that had
set in. The announcement, a brief letter, was reproduced. Reagan knew 
that his mind was closing down, could watch to a certain extent as the
world became increasingly incomprehensible.* The article points to the
sheer physicality of the note, its obdurate (grainy) presence in a world
of typing, memos, and modems. The writing-body makes an uncanny impres-
sion: ink flows where the hand moves; sweat curls paper slightly; the 
surface of skin moves slowly above, touches, then out of reach or beyond, 
what it inscribes. I think that is still the value, for example, of pain-
ting, in a world of absolute encoding - that a certain resistance re- 
mains possible. Resistance is what the world itself did best; harvesting 
required sheer physical effort, and making a hut from mammoth bones was an 
obviously long process. Time was a commodity that went on forever; look at
the pyramids. And inscription itself, of any form, seemed to imply a 
cutting-into or demarcation upon, a surface. But that is the way the world
was and the world no longer changes with its markings.

For the computer changes everything, recreates inscription as _packet-sub-
stance,_ and our words are formed according to predetermined characteris-
tic signatures and protocols. This isn't a secondary effect; it is pri-
mordial within cyberspace, and humans therefore turn around and create
ulterior ontologies within the bandwidth of this representation, we who
inhabit Cybermind or Fiction-of-Philosophy, Future Culture, etc.,  
friends, enemies, and lovers. But these are technologically fragile, and
there is always already the packet-substance in the background, the sub-
stance of the sheer weight of this communication, simultaneously weight-
less and full. 

It is this substance that makes protest so difficult, so problematic. It
is this substance that is no substance at all; fluidic, protest seeps,
and without the slough of granularity, its appearance is translucent at
best. The substance is all signifier and image, all simulacrum.

Models of resistance and opposition imply force, power, drawn from the
material world: _when push comes to shove._ Like embezzlement, the pack-
et-substance is a flux or shuffling of markers, no more or less serious,
no more or less ideologically-bound. Like violent physical crime in rela-
tion to embezzlement, physicality in relation to packet-substance makes 
the latter, not immediately a site of the world itself, problematic under 
any category in which the former is prosecuted. The prosecution of the 
physical returns a model of resistance; the prosecution of packet-subs-
tance emits flux, the capital of speech at several removes. We are weak-
ened at the very source of our language, and protest may appear nothing 
at all.

Isn't this, finally, the true liquidity of capital, detached from every
source and standard? True communication at variance, no wonder psychoa-
alytic processes play such intensive roles, once the user is detached as
well from data-bases, cast adrift in the imaginary. The force is in the
dreaming of it, and it takes the real, or its semblance, to make it real,
it/s/self.

*There is a world in this knowledge as well, this shutting-down of the
feed-back loops of self-reference, extending outward, elsewhere. I leave
it to someone else to develop the topic.

Access


Ftp: The screen curls away; the commands operate against the impervious
wall absenting recognition. Download before reading. File arrangements
are familiar and unknown, users and publications dominating. There is 
always a foreign name or two. Promises are always late as the files ring
adultery, the surface of one machine beckoning to another.

Telnet: These are false lovers, since you're almost always led down a 
path to something desired, the small end of a funnel bypassing the enor-
mous kernel working against all odds. You don't know where you are; the
screen curls towards you. This is the domain of the grid.

WWW: Already the promise of a neighborhood built on the backs of gophers
and ftp, but the communal remains in the future. This is the generation
to come, eliminating blocks of information and history; with everything
linked, nothing is impervious, and transparency gives credence to the
inauthenticity of being. Its foundations are maverick hacker-worlding,
easy for marks like me.

Gopher: The venetian-blind world turning up menu after menu, each label-
ling something a vast distance from something else. So much remains dis-
connected, but it _seems_ as if the geography were real, as if God her-
self alphabetized existence. One is drawn in forever and a day beyond
the text; the text is all there is. 

Usenet, Email, E-Lists: Here the voice struggles to be heard, procure a
site for its absent granularity. Psychoanalytical processes dominate as
text is taken for real, data for the outlines of beings everywhere in
the world. We are speaking of organism speaking here, the realm of the
imaginary or uncanny. It's as if Usenet described the world, E-lists
commented on it, E-lists or their inhabitants, waiting for release.

Mbone: Swollen, to come, dinosaur lumbering with something approaching
_presentation._ The disappearance of text will result in withdrawal, 
perhaps the pleasure of the face which is always other.

IRC: As if speaking were the final thing, or chats where you have sex
pretending you don't, or even thinking you're touching or moving an
emotional battery. 

MUDS, MOOS: Where you're touching or moving objects, always there in 
worlds which need continuous construction, no further epistemology.
Where there is always space, there is always surplus; where there is
always site, capital loses its hold.

TALK: The frenzy of knowing who you are, revealing yourself by your
typed, effaced mistakes, errors crowding the screen hurtling towards you
at unimaginable velocities. In TALK, MUDS, MOOS, you begin not to know
the weather, you find yourself at the end of a brilliant other.

FINGER: You find yourself at the end of a brilliant other, locked-in,
locked out, always the screen closed down, cauterizing sexual pleasure.
What does it say but you do or don't want to play.

Image: All download images, set standards for decompressions (so it
breathes easier), create a lapse constructing voyeurism. The lapse is
when the machine runs, processes, begins the unarduous task of pimping
the naked screen. Images break, fall apart; a woman's head appears upon
a man's torso, everything else transformed into noise. The screen 
shatters.

Other forms, Archie, Veronica, Wais, Jughead, ride the protocols as ftp
itself doubles the process. Everything transforms into everything, but 
an address remains just that, not necessarily devoured by access, not
necessarily accessible. It is in fact the _inaccessible_ that may be of
greatest interest, those untraceable telnet locations for example. Here
the backbone meets the gristle, and only a few may apply.

Learning to write the united states


Anarchic gangs roam around the united states, meeting in corrals, fight-
ing their way across rocky landscapes, marauding gangs of police have
their own headquarters as well, backwards and forwards there's a slurry
of individuals, organizations, these are the united states, no plan of
action, nothing, no law, this is why the rest of the world fears us,
we've got no idea what we're doing, no compunctions. But we've got money
and I hear the color's going to change, tell one bill from another, blue
one green five, maybe yellow two or a ten. So they'll circulate, these
abstract numbers and we can learn adding just as well, one-ten make green
five, what have you. But we have no regard for this. We have no regard
because there will be no history of anything otherwise different, because
as I've always said, our history's in the future, and is whatever we'll
say it will be, unless someone else says something different, and that's
okay too.

We have the space to draw lines in the sand in the grass prairies across
the mountains, still the space, and the groups there to draw it. What
clashes is languages, but the languages, all of them, are getting smaller
and there are new ones every day, everyone speaking all the time. But why
listen when there's nothing to say and it's all reported and there's too
much of it; which is why there's a focus on Mica-Madonna, Simpson-Silver,
which is where Ballard was right before he copped out on telling the 
truth about the present. But you can have any truth you want.

What you have to understand is that this isn't even anarchy, it's not a
lack of organization, it's just that organization doesn't figure into it.
Nothing figures into it, nothing but those moments when you trace things
walking a path across a national park, which is all there is here, 
designed and very dangerous for we have guns. We have the aces up the 
sleeve as well. So you've got to understand it's not government, big or
little, but that's a page of it, and it's not one or another party, but
that's another page - and it's not outlaws, nothing like that. It's the
names that are given to things which are weakened and fall off things, 
and that falling off is the united states and maybe america too.

Like there should be an ending, like a description which curls round
itself, completes something. What we keep telling you is everything is
equivalent; this is what we used to tell ourselves. First we told our-
selves, and that was the eighteenth century. Then we listened, and that
was the nineteenth century. Then we tell you, and that goes on forever.
Like I said as well, there's no then we are told, only the telling of
the future and we're good at that.
