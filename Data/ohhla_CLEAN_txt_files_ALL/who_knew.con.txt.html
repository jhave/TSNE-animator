[Intro: Consequence]
Man, I know a nigga seen me how my Timbs was leanin kid
Nigga probably thought man I had
I got cursed or somethin man but
Wasn't even like that kid, it's just
It's just the trials and tribulations you go through in life
Ain't nothin kid, ain't nothin a soldier can't handle, y'knahmean?
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
 
[Chorus 2X: Consequence]
Cause yo, who knew my luck would change?
Who knew my luck would change?
I thought a year from now, it be like here and now
And no one would hear me now, hear me now
 
[Consequence]
Listen, I used to have to stay in this clogged up basement
Now I'm gettin calls just for product placement
They say that song "Spaceship" gave my career a facelift
Now I'm on the comeback trail to make a statement
Cause who I put my faith in ain't no four-leaf clover
Or if your birthday fall between June and October
So I don't read no horoscopes or go to astrologers
Or clutch a rabbit's foot when I'm Twist'n like Oliver
My love is grab tarot cards and shuffle the deck
I'd rather hit the road hard and go hustle a check
It wasn't nothin to 'Quence, when them haters didn't wish me well
Cause now they all throw me they money like a wishing well
And when I slipped and fell, it ain't made me superstitious
It proved my prayer changes, now I got that Coupe edition
But they all figured only way he make a Porsche cruise
Is if I ate blue diamonds, pink hearts and horseshoes
 
[Chorus] + Tony Williams singing and ad libbing
 
[Consequence]
Now if you knew my situation probably thought a mirror shattered
Or mighta even said that I had walk beneath a ladder
'Til I made 'em envy/N-V me like the initials for Nevada
But once you turn to God, none of that should even matter
But to see how niggaz scatter when I lost my cash
You woulda swore, a black cat had crossed my path
They either lost my math, or I missed they call
But now I see right through 'em like a crystal ball
If it was up to y'all, I would never get discovered
But I chose to evolve and got myself up out the gutter
But they tryna pull me back, the way they did to others
Who told us grip the pole and dance, say bread and butter
Well you tell them motherfuckers, so much for the jinx
Cause now we're Loius Vuitton dressed shirts from Fink{?}
And if they had to nerve to think that I would ever give up
Well homie let 'em know that they shit out of luck
 
[Chorus] + Tony Williams singing and ad libbing
 
[Consequence]
Sing it
 
[Tony Williams  repeat 2X]
Who knew, that my luck would change
Who knew, that my luck would change
I got cars, I got cribs among other things
But this here's from the heart so my love won't change
Who knew, that my luck would change
Who knew, that my luck would change
I thought a year from now
No one would hear me now
 
[Chorus] + Tony Williams singing and ad libbing
 
[Tony Williams]
