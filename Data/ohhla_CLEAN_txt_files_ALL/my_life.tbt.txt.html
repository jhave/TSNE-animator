[Mannie]
I done teached and talked
Walked away and fought
Went from cussin and bustin
Hustle from day to dark
Turned nothin to somethin
Introduced to stunnin
In my life In my life
I done caused some hurt
And I done did some good
Said I can't even when I could
I was stopped and tested fingerprinted and arrested
In my life In my life
Just say no when I really meant yes
I'm gon smoke all night til it hurt my chest
Slim told me over the years that shit gon tear up careers 
In yo life In yo life
What'chu gon do when snakes come to yo crew
I'm a get on my knees and ask the Lord please
Separate good from fake and the love and the hate
In my life In my life

[B.G.]
I mean fuck I done had a rough life you know what I'm sayin
B.G. lived that thug life
I done done it all in my life
I done done time
I done lived in group homes
I been on the third floor of hospitals
I mean it's just been a stuggle for me
But now I'm on top you know what I'm sayin
And it ain't to turnin back
And I take chances in whatever I do
Cuz if I don't take chances I don't see the life after all

[Mannie]
The night in the Rover
When the niggas came over
You went out like a soldier
And I still can't get over
What fake bitches done done
Got me clutchin my gun
In this life In this life
I used to wonder why 
All the good niggas die
Why some soldier gotta suffer
And mothers gotta cry
Why my daddie gotta lie
Cuz he don't even try to be 
In my life In my life
Take care of your crib 
Where you lay down and live
Forget and forgive cuz you done put it through some shit
Had yo daughter and yo son 
Been down since day one
In yo life In yo life
What the fuck is wrong you don't understand this song
Tell yo momma you love her before she dead and gone
Nigga that don't quit that's some real ass shit 
In this life In this life

[Juvenile]
Man I mean me Juvenile drugs tore my family up
I'm from the projects so you know I just realized
What it means to be successful
Cuz I been through all kinds of shit man bullshit
And I live through Baby, Slim and the Lord to help me
And I came to them as a real nigga 
And I said look dog I'm tired of livin like this man

[Baby]
I had pounds of coke
I had money to blow
I had a felony charge
I had to fight in the court
I had warrant reports
Shot up cars before 
In my life My life
I got kids to feed
I got niggas to watch
I need a hundred mil
I need to get off the block
Wear soldier Rees
In the gamblin spot 
In my life My life
I could cook it and cut it
I could bag it and move it
I could toat in the budget 
Got money to prove it 
I done flood the public
Hope Beatrice'll do it
In my life My life
Now my name is Baby
But the call me Bubba
Ain't a bitch that I know that can say that I love her
Gettin pussy from a boss bitch wearin a rubber 
In my life My life
Let me stunt and shine
Let me bling and floss
Let me ride without the law always searchin my car
I just wanna chill fuck bitches and play 
In my life My life
Hoes cry in my world give me that Baby shit
Goin to the people knowin that they made me and shit
You just don't know what I go through 
In my life My life
I got Bentlys and Jags got Prowlers and Vets
Got Benjamins, Hummers, Cadillacs and vests
Condos and houses Cardiers and Rovers
In my life My life
I got cars and broads with money to make
I got that brown wall and that white gate
Got bitches and hoes love that platinum and gold 
In my life My life
