[Silkk]
U know what I'm bout 
 
[Trina]
U know what I'm bout 
 
[Master P]
Yo Silkk ask Trina can she wobble that thing... 
 
Where my niggas yo? 
Where my ladies yo? 
 
[Silkk]
Who you know could give it to you until you fall out 
When you wake up - go by the mall out 
Hop on the plane sperm or nothing never thawed out 
Have her saying my name like Destiny's Child 
Cause I go all out 
Speaking more sex than money so talk with your tongue out 
And sex unbelievable, plus the money never run out 
I'm a thug so I walk the street with my gun out 
Top up when the sun set, top down when the sun out 
oh you want me, pushing up your number on the slick 
Try to make the scene when I was in front of the click 
how bout I pull the thongs off in the summer and shit 
Laughing at my joke when it wasn't even funny and shit 
She need a t-mac ms shaq she think that I ball 
She know I'm a real nigga, plus she love that I'm tall 
Checks again when she missed the phone, thinking I called 
She wanna fall for me look, but she think I'm a dog 
 
Chorus: Silkk 
Need somebody with some doe 
That's cool 
Who gon keep it on the low 
That's cool 
Who gon do you right 
That's cool 
You need a soulja in your life, that's right 
 
Chorus: Trina 
You need a lover and a friend 
That's cool 
Who got ya back to the end 
That's tru 
Somebody that's off the chain 
That's cool 
Who could twurk that thang 
 
[Trina]
You wanna fuck that's cool but you gotta be the greatest 
Take me the Prada, buy my the latest 
Try it on the jet, fly me to Vegas 
The Baddest Bitch can't nann hoe fade this 
Paid bitch, in a gray six, made bitch 
Blinging about 10 karats in the bracelet 
Face it stick your tongue out I let you taste it 
And if you broke when you see me nigga don't say shit 
Cause I'm looking for a nigga that's filthy rich 
Yo name Silkk, that's cool I'm a Silky bitch 
Lil Mama stay shining like cuts in ice 
Off glass make you bust three nuts in a night 
And when I put it on ya, I hope you can stand it 
I need a tune-up daddy is you the mechanic? 
Cause if you coming at me right with the real cash 
You can play with me all night like Dreamcast 
 
Chorus: Trina 
You need a lover and a friend 
That's cool 
Who got ya back to the end 
That's tru 
Somebody that's off the chain 
That's cool 
Who could twurk that thang 
 
Chorus: Silkk 
Need somebody with some doe 
That's cool 
Who gon keep it on the low 
That's cool 
Who gon do you right 
That's cool 
You need a soulja in your life, that's right 
 
[Silkk]
Your friends wonder why the house you never leaving 
They knew wut you gettin in life now they wouldn't leave the house 
either 
 
[Trina]
See I'm a real ass chick I'm a stay by your side 
And when its time to ride for my man, I'm a ride 
 
[Silkk]
Just be a down chick cause you aint gotta slave in fact - 
Not cook, clean or nothing cause I got maids for that 
 
[Trina]
Just treat me how you wanna be treated
cause if I suck it and fuck it you gon' beat it and eat it
 
[Silkk]
So I gots to put it on ya, have ya acting all silly 
Then try to convince yourself that you aint catching feelings 
I need a girl who bout it and know how to hit it 
You aint gotta scheme on the doe, 
cause if ya cards right, you gon get it 
Some chicks aint real though, (Some niggas'll stunt) 
I know what a woman need, (I know what a nigga want) 
So keep it tight, and fuck the world 
And who ever end up with me, that's one lucky girl 
 
Chorus: Silkk 
Need somebody with some doe 
That's cool 
Who gon keep it on the low 
That's cool 
Who gon do you right 
That's cool 
You need a soulja in your life, that's right 
 
Chorus: Trina 
You need a lover and a friend 
That's cool 
Who got ya back to the end 
That's tru 
Somebody that's off the chain 
That's cool 
Who could twurk that thang

Brake it, rake it nah, drop it drop it
