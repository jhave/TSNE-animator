[Shock G, singing]
Sex packets, a dollar or two
Just tell me, how many for you
This time... this time...
This time... this time...
Sex packets, the girl of your dreams
Just try one, it's not what it seems
There's love... there's love...
There's love... there's love...
Now it's just sex in a pill
It gives me such a thrill, it's nice
And it's a guy for a girl, or a girl for a guy
Try one tonight
Now I just can't wait, till I get home tonight
I got three for $10.99
No sex can be safer
It's a pill, wrapped in a little piece of paper
Real nice
Sex packets, a dollar or two
Just tell me, how many for you
This time... this time...
This time... this time...
Sex packets, a one or a two
I just sell them, I cannot do
This love... this love...
This love... this love...
Oh ohh girl
You look so good to me, you're fine
And oh ohh girl
You whispered in my ear, said "Not tonight"
You just won't get with me, and you think that you dissed me
But now I can still be gettin busy
With any girl I like
No more will I ever have to jack it
Cause instead, I can just take a packet
Real nice
Sex packets, a dollar or two
Just tell me, how many for you this time
This time
This time... this time...
