Yea..Uh..Play N Skillz..Krayzie Bone..Adina..Freaks..Yea..Come on

[Adina Howard]
I want you to freak me 'til the morning

[Hook]

[Krayzie Bone]
The world has to many freaks

[Adina Howard]
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you late at night

[Krayzie Bone]
The world has to many freaks

[Adina Howard]
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you late at night

[Krayzie Bone]
The world has to many freaks

[Adina Howard]
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you late at night

[Krayzie Bone]
The world has to many freaks

[Adina Howard]
Freak you on the counter, freak you on the table
Freak you lying up, 'cause I can't wait to freak you later

[Play]
I wanna, look let you know never that
To the bedroom give me head room, straight to the point
My time to clown, let you know from the gate I don't go downtown
To many freaks that'll please me
I'm that playa you better believe
I'm payin' no cheese, but I guarantee
That I still got a freak everyday of the week
I love the feeling when you dealing with someone
Poppin' and moving your body all night long
My jewels get bigger when you giving me dome
And I get a little crazy when its time to bone
My life made you think I was one of a kind
And my ice made you think that love was blind
Seperate the great, from the weak freaks
I would never hate, I love all my freaks
But I never love a hoe, never let a hoe know that
That I gotta lot of dough, she ain't gotta know
Take it to the room, I don't need your voice
But I might need your mouth to provide the moist
Didn't think you had the brains 'til I met ya knees
And swallow my seeds and now I see
Why chose one freak when?

[Hook]

[Krayzie Bone]
I done been around the whole wide world
I done been so many places, seen many different faces
Met girls, girls, nasty girls
Real bad girls, chasin' this platinum world
And around, behind me and my
They sayin' wanna get me high
They wanna spend some time
With a thug and get freaky with it
In a hot tub thuggin' gettin' with it
We can freak a deal
Turn off the lights
Come over here, with me
Take off all your clothes, and freak me baby

[Hook]

[Skillz]
Uh..Uh
You gets none from me ma
You gets nada, no Gucchi, no Prada
Holla at a chick then I mack her down
Hit, then I pass sex hand me down
Said I been around the world
Ay yah, been hated on for the things I got
But I don't cuff 'em man, I just rub 'em man
Talk real fine, then I fuck 'em man
And I love them girls that love to bone, bone, bone
Call me up when she all alone, she'll do with the dome
She'll ride for days, take my bricks
Take my yay'
You don't play
I'm the playa to call
All you get is a little Cristal
Puff the 'dro, you know my style
Coke by the freight with a Kodak smile
Straight with the beats, I'm straight with the cheese
I'm straight to the point, I'm straight to the sheets
Why chose one freak, when the?

[Hook]

[Adina Howard]
Ohhh..
I took my t-shirt and my panties off
I want you to freak me 'til the morning
We can do it anyway you like
In the shower, on the counter
Every hour</pre>
