(*ad libs in beginning*)

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
I don't know what you've been told
About these fours that you control
Now everybody know the brother's calm
And I cover the arm (yeah), smother the charm (yeah)
Girls say a brother the bomb
But ain't no ladies in my life, other than moms (uh uh)
That's 'til this girl changed my way
And it even feels strange to say
I'm so caught up, cause I can't stand to admit
Cupid got good aim, your man has been hit

[Verse 2 - Usher]
I'm the kinda brother
Who been doin it my way, gettin my bread for years - in my career
And every lover (y'all)
In and out my life, I hid love and left a tear - without a care
(Until I met this girl who turned the tables around)
Met this girl, turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise and I
(I never thought I'd be the one breaking down)
I can't figure it out why

[Chorus - Usher]
I'm so - caught up
Got me feelin it - caught up
I don't know what it is
(But she's seems she got me twisted)
But it seems she got me twisted
I'm so - caught up
Got me feelin it - caught up
I'm losin control, this girl's got a hold on me, yeah

[Verse 3 -Usher]
(Ahhhhh ...)
Oh naw, let me go baby (oh)
Now listen (oh)

My momma told me
Be careful who you do, cause karma comes back around, same old song (now)
But I was so sure that it wouldn't happen to me, cause I know how to put it
down
But I was so wrong
This girl was mean (so mean), she really turned me out (she's so mean)
(Her body was so tight, I'm looking for another date, top of the flashlight
yeah)
My homies say this girl is crampin my style (she's crampin my style)
And I can't figure it out but

[Chorus - Usher]
I'm so - caught up
Got me feelin it - caught up
I don't know what it is (what it is)
But it seems she got me twisted (but it seems she got me twisted)
I'm so - caught up
Got me feelin it - caught up
I'm losin control, this girl's got a hold
I'm so - caught up
Really feelin it - caught up (hey)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted (but it seems she's got me twisted)
I'm so - caught up
Really feelin it - caught up
I'm losin control, this girl's got a hold on me

[Break - Usher] - w/ ad libs
(Ahhhh...) (oh)
And I think I like it baby (oh)
Oh nooooo, oh whoa no
Oh, yeah, oh my, ohh

[Verse 4 - Fabolous]
Yeah man
Now I'm the kinda brother (uh), the kinda lover (uh)
But I'm reminded of the (yeah)
way L-O-V-E be blinded others (yeah)
But I know that I won't find another (no)
That a do like you (uh) and feel like this (uh)
I knew like few who real like this (uh)
I do like you, S-H-E-R (yeah)
Baby we are, two of the flyest, youngest, pimpest niggaz around
Throwin seven figures around
Like we don't care, ain't like we don't share
For this girl, ain't a shoe she won't wear
But we don't dare (nope), say we ain't stuck (uh)
How you fit in a seven and say it ain't luck? (damn)
Sister's been bought up, yes I'm caught up
The Fabolous player about to get his sport up
Like for real


[Chorus - Usher]
This girl with me, she really turned me out (yeah, yeah, yeah, sugar)
My homies say this girl's crampin my style, now

I'm soooo - caught up
Why I'm - caught up
I don't know what it is (what it is)
But it seems she's got me twisted (she got me twisted)
I'm so - caught up
Really feelin it - caught up
I'm losin control, this girl's got a hold
I'm so - caught up
I'm so - caught up
I don't know what it is but it seems shes got me twisted (twisted)
I'm - caught up
Really feelin it - caught up
I'm losin control, this girl's got a hold on me
