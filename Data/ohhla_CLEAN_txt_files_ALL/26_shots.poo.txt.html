"Yo.. why was I just over here thinking about my damn 26th birthday?
 You remember that? I had the BRILLIANT idea of taking 26 shots
 Didn't even make it all the way! By 23, people was just passing me WATER
 In this damn shot glasses, talkin 'bout 'Here, here, it's vodka, it's vodka!'
 Man, all I remember.. from that night
 Was you ending up having to take me home.. and on the ride
 I went from laughing, damn crying, boo-hooing
 Then... get to my girl's house.. and wanted to fight-ed..
 some nigga that was outside.. you tellin me to shut the fuck up
 And then when I get to the house, I didn't really care about my girl no mo'
 All I was askin for was the damn dog.. ehehehehe!
 Well... turned out that I peed in the bed
 Thinkin I was in the bathroom... yeah, not a good look"</pre>
