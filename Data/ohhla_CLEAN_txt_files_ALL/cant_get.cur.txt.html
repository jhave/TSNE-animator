Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I never seen myself being a broke nigga
I'm never seen in the company of no ho niggas
One of the bosses that could send an order
But I get out of the car, do it on my own, nigga
Think when Frank White send the hit on Chinatown Larry
Jumped out of that black-on-black, rat-a-tated
The enemy's main bitch was the first one that he let have it
My brother always strapped, I don't like guns too much
But see, he love me to death so I guess that's why he bought me one
Them haters be watching you son
Don't trip, we be watchin' them
So they'll never get the drop
Top in the trunk, smelling like a skunk
Looking like one too, racing stripes
Looking like coke lines runnin' across my coupe
Way higher than you
Bitch on the phone tellin' you something that's not true
Jet Life always coming up
Looking like a million plus when I'm coming through

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Yeah, yeah, life
I can't get in and I can't get out
I can't get out and I can't get in
La, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
Life
And they never know my next move, I leave them clueless
They praying that I fall off, they must be foolish
But the shit I'm talking about, I really do this
Truly, I'm a mad buddha abuser, my nigga
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no U-Haul, but I keep it moving
On my mission to the top, let's fuck them losers
No more Young Roddy, Young Ro the Ruler
Peep how I maneuver through this manure
I'm talking two hoes in my two door
But usually I ride solo
And this time I'm going for the dust, though
In HD, I've seen niggas cut throat
And if you don't know, and if you must know
I drop my jewels like a klutz, though
But I'm still fly like I'm nuts, though
And the fast money still give me a rush, my nigga
And I still got the will to go and get it
In the streets, I'm a gorilla
Hustle hard from dawn to dusk, my nigga</pre>
