[Chorus]
Come on everybody let's all get down
Come on everybody let's all get down
Come on everybody let's all get down
What we bring to you, is the Boot Camp sound

[Steele]
So that nobody out there will be misled
We come to bring this to you live and direct
Live and direct from the Boot Camp set
We be W-W-B-C-C, family is our Priority
We wan' look out for you, so you look out for we
So each one, for each one it's necessary
To establish this establishment in a hurry
Don't worry, Rhino got security very trained
Cuz we don't know how sometimes things get buried
But in my vision I see, how all my peeps
Congregate in common unity
The place soon to be packed in capacity
It makes me glad to see all these celebrities
Reminds me of back in the days of Rag Time
When my people used to come and show they face and shine
Spend a couple of dimes, sip some wine
Brothers look sharp, sisters lookin revive
So get up, get live, grown folks on line
Young folks allowed only if they act pride
There's a party tonight, open and vibe
Get ready, cuz we bout to let the bomb ignite, the bomb ignite

[Chorus]

[Mada Rocka]
Come in and bring, you divine, simply refined
Pull out the glasses boy, you bout to taste the finest wine
I'm tryin to shine like the soldiers Smif-N-Wessun
Count yours blessings, and take heed, life is full of lessons
No need for stressin and dwellin on the past
Hit the blunt and pass, and pick your body up and dance
Chill, let Mada Rocka put you in a trance
We gon see who them rag or not

[Steele]
We got Brown on the keyboards, Boogie Brown on the q-sticks
Mr. Brown on guitar, oh Lord
Eye an eye, like the Gemini
Speakin of Gemini, caught the B.D.I. smokin wit Smokey Lah

[LS]
Come on, you better come on down
You better come on down, you better come on down

[Chorus]

[Buckshot]
I got a lesson from the good Reverend Meouphe
He told me when the vibe is negative, Buck be off
I stay in tune, wit the feel of the most natural meal
We W B C, brake the seal, make ya squaller and kneel
Know you know the deal, Rag Time you better come down for real

[Chorus]
