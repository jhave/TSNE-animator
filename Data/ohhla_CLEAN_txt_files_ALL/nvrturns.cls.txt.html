[Chorus] - w/ ad libs
All the things that you thinkin but you don't know
We don't know where we're goin
Thinkin a moment's gone past
Motions movin so slow

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Yeah, she was seventeen years old, life was good
Innocent young girl from a nice neighborhood
Big white house with a small picket fence
Known around school, had a choice pickin friends
You know, cheerleader, real good grades
Never smoked weed when her friends would blaze
So a bigger picture and built the framework
Mature for her age and nobody could change her
Life's unexpected, it shakes you up
So after high school, life will wake you up
She went on to University, all her friends went
Loosened up a bit and started to experiment (yeah)
Grades started slippin when the liquor started tippin
Five months later and the girl started sniffin
Six months later, she wants to drop out
Eight months later, it's over, she walks out
Parents hate it and don't accept failure (nah)
Diss on her daughter, won't write or mail her (yeah)
Lives on the streets now, kicked out her trailer (yeah)
Trick out herself to pay for drug paraphernalia
Life is funny but shit ain't a joke
No one laughs when it happens to someone you know
Happens every single day in the World that we live in (yeah)
It never turns out how you thought it would, did it? (nope)

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Break] - 2X - w/ ad libs
Brought up in insolent conditions
In a position, outside the lines that fit in

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Yeah, he was seven years old and came from nothin (yeah)
Never knew his father and his mother never loved him (nah)
Nothin at his home 'cause he never had a home (nope)
Grew up on the streets, had to learn on his own
Started doin drugs at a early age
Got his first court case at the age of eight
And everybody said he's on a path to destruction
Always would remind him that he'd amount to nothin
In and out of juvenile every other year
But at seventeen starts to get his head clear
He figured out things quicker than most
'Cause he was thrown into life without guidance from his folks
You mature a lot quicker when you have to
Cleaned up his act, did what he had to
Grew tired of the drugs and the tattoos
Didn't follow in his mom's or his dad's shoes
Couldn't let the cycle continue
But he gotta eat and picks his own food from the menu
Twenty-five, now he's got a real job, wife and kids
He built his life from shit (shit ...)
Life is funny but shit ain't a joke
Doesn't matter what we come from, we just don't know
Where our life's gonna go in this World that we live in
It never turns out how you thought it would, did it?

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Classified - talking over Chorus]
Never turns out how you thought it would, did it?

[Break] - w/ ad libs

[Outro - Classified - talking]
All the things that you thinkin but you don't know
We pick our own path and take it</pre>
