C-Murder talks

Chorus-C-Murder
Now do you really want peace
Or do you really want beef-(2x)
You say keep it real 
It's all about the game
But when you live the street life
It can bring you so much pain

{C-Murder}
Now I'm tryin' and pryin' and
Pullin' dem hoes 
Smoking so much green 
I just can't feel it no mo'
Now when I'm high ain't no lie
I'm kind of stronger than before
I lose my buzz and I wonder 
How that blood go on the floor
Now I'm competing wit' nobody
My gun is bigger
Now I ain't looking for trouble
But I ain't runnin from no nigga
I meet aside for my nigga
Reincarnating get revenge and granting wishes
Leave the bitch wit' his jealous friends
Ain't nothin' mo' dangerous than a man in denial
Ask the Hail Mary please baptize me in eternal fire
Cause evil lurks behind every door
Papa killed hisself
I guess he couldn't take it no mo'
And livin'young and dumb 
Niggas hustlin' for fun
Hoes addicted to dubs like fiends addicted to drugs
My young victims on these killin' fields
Wishin' for peace
But see the opposite of ??? is dead-end streets

Chorus-2x

{Magic}
Now do you really want beef huh
You showing off in front of dem chessy broads
What I supposed to blow this off 
Fuck that shit I'm going off 
Say Fath let me holla at you about something
You got a light(Here)(gunshot blast)
Then I start to dump it
Didn't matter where the fuck we at
You gonna get ya issue
So tell ya papa bye-bye
And I know that he gon' miss you
But my nerves bad and 
I don't play no games wit' ya
Now ya mama eyes running masscara she need tissue
Dressed in all black 
This could've been avoided 
But ya started now you're dearly departed
Hit'em wit' a mickey
Fakin' like a waiter 
He drinkin' gin and juice
He'll never taste the flava 
A few seconds later he gettin' all dizzy
Fallin',reachin' for the table
Once yoy croos the line fuck peace 
And I won't rest until yo' funky ass deceased
Ya heard me

Chorus-2x
