[Block McCloud Speaking]
Yeah, yo J.J. (What up Block?)
This beat is crazy man it's cold. (Thank you thank you.)
So cold. Block McCloud (Word) Big Lou what up? 
(And it goes like this.)

[Verse One] [Block McCloud]
I'm so cold I'm cool, it's like a visit to North Pole
And Block McCloud is the wizard of blizzards
If I don't know ya I'm frigged 
Storm by ya like a breeze
But my swagger my steez will make a shorty freeze
And drop to her knees like she coppin' a plea
I'm not iced out or coppin' no V
I'm just poppin' with these
Metaphors makin' sense to all of they charm
As soon as I enter the door, temperature change, droppin' degrees
Like a Masters, a Bachelors, a Doctorate please
I hear myself I'm so sick with the flow, I'll probably sneeze (Achu)
I'm so catchy, common cold, you wanna party with me
Well if I got it, you got it, now you caught the disease
Not your a Mark Of The Beast, a monster like Reef
That stomps through the east
And wants to be freed to conquor the streets
Uh, at night I'm heat
I'm hot, I'm cold on the morning block
Changin' the whole games climate like global warmin'
Hey hey

[Chorus]
This world made me what I am
And I am, just adaptin' to the weather
So run on home and get your coat cause I'm so cold
You better run and find some shelter
I'm so darn cold hearted
To hot to handle, to cold to hold

[Verse Two] [J.J. Brown]
My prose froze like an icebox, colder than white cops
So Wind in the City where they hostin' the White Sox
I'm chilly like a chick with silly loot at the night spot
A willy cause I'm Cool Hand Luke but my dice hot
Frosty as the Rockies, y'all just photo copies
Warm until exposed, the way Sodom broke the Nazi's
Go head and get your posse
I hope you know a polar bear 
Cause you gonna need a coat this storm
I hear it's pretty cold in there
Jeah
I'm freezin', it's top season for frost season
Up oxygen to your car freezin', ya stop breathin'
(Hey Jay when you gon' quit?)
Homie not even 
I don't give a shit, come equipped cause the block's teethin'
Had low temperatures
Brown bounced the predators
Master beat is red as I drown out competitors
Cold as evidence
Ground beneath the sediments
Sounds that crush clowns like mounds of beefin' elephants
You geeks will never get, a skotch of my shine
?No Gargamel like you was book?, but the flow shit is mine
Look
Cool your heels fam
Don't touch the pestilence 
Jay got yourself in the clouds bless the medicines
Like hey

[Chorus]

[J.J. Brown Speaking]
Ladies and gentlemen. Me and this dude go way back. Celph Titled!

[Verse Three] [Celph Titled]
I love this sound proof foam inside my mic booth
It makes me feel like I'm in a padded room
Insane asylum sick with a deranged smile
And I'll electrocute your recruits 
(What's this man mean?)
I'm awful with
Ether or arsenic in my canteen 
Rappers can't compete with me
Fuck it I'm a beast on beats
I get mine
I'm grid iron
You eatin' cleats for Easter treats
You singin' summer camp songs
I'm Ol' Dirty Bastard, Janet Jackson's Rolling Stones cover, hands on
I'm cold
From production to lyrics
I'll fuck with the spirits
That unleash catastrophic mayhem fire, that sears kids
Call a bitch to fuck cause I need sex
Like motherfuckin' Terrell Owen's needs Kleenex
So respect
The ring leader, let's ring it off
Jehovah's Witness with a sawed off and I'll ring your door
(Hannibal in stereo)
Oh, I'll watch the exercise video and thought an ab crunch was new cereal
Huh?

[Chorus]</pre>
