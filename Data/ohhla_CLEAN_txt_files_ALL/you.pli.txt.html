[Chorus: Tank]
You! {You)
Thinking about me! (Thinking about me)
Sucking on you! (Sucking on you)
You sucking on me! (Can you do it for me babe?)
Me! (Me)
Thinking about you! (Thinking about you)
Cumming on me! (Cumming on me baby)
Me cumming on you! (Me cumming on you shorty babe)

[Verse 1: Plies]
Hoe, dont be cute, tonight I want to get nasty
Let me drop this mayonnaise, baby, in your salad
Slide your hand in my pants if you want to grab it
Bet as soon as you touch it, you call me "big" daddy
Want to lick all over you before I let you have it
Hold your legs open for me so I can really pack it
I'm already rock hard, you ain't got to jack me
Bet the tip of this tounge make you really like it
Picture us on the floor with no clothes on
You eating me, I'm eating you, shit we both raw
Let you ride me tonight off your favorite song
Tonight a special night, baby a freak is born

[Chorus: Tank]
You! {You)
Thinking about me! (Thinking about me)
Sucking on you! (Sucking on you)
You sucking on me! (Can you do it for me babe?)
Me! (Me)
Thinking about you! (Thinking about you)
Cumming on me! (Cumming on me baby)
Me cumming on you! (Me cumming on you shorty babe)

[Verse 2: Plies]
Let me cut a hole right in the middle of your panties
Put a peep-hole right on top your candy
I'ma have you moaning when you grab me
I'm a goon lil' momma but I like it fancy
See, sucking all on you is what gets you all ancy
Seeing how a goon moves, makes you want to chase me
After I rip you tonight you might want to ban me
Your friend wanted me to, thats why she can't stand me
It's your friend in your jeans that got my attention
A real nigga in your life is all you missing
Ain't nobody like me baby, I'm my competition
Baby when you walk out the door in the morning you leave with me

[Chorus: Tank]
You! {You)
Thinking about me! (Thinking about me)
Sucking on you! (Sucking on you)
You sucking on me! (Can you do it for me babe?)
Me! (Me)
Thinking about you! (Thinking about you)
Cumming on me! (Cumming on me baby)
Me cumming on you! (Me cumming on you shorty babe)

[Verse 3: Plies]
If you want to we could just tease eachother
Get drunk. Get naked and lay under cover
Let me peek at her first before I go any further
Stick my finger in yo mouth before I even touch her
Ain't got to put it in, we could just hunch eachother
See if I could make you nut without even fucking you
Feel me pushing up against you, then go on and rub you
Now you mad you want to fuck, I could tell how you cussing
Just a couple minutes ago, you wasn't fucking nothing
Now you pressing up against me because that pussy gushing
Got you swerving all over, now got you touching
Made a crunk cut, now we sucking and fucking

[Chorus: Tank]
You! {You)
Thinking about me! (Thinking about me)
Sucking on you! (Sucking on you)
You sucking on me! (Can you do it for me babe?)
Me! (Me)
Thinking about you! (Thinking about you)
Cumming on me! (Cumming on me baby)
Me cumming on you! (Me cumming on you shorty babe)
