[O.C.]
Uhh
You don't stop baby (mm-hmm)
Shawn J. baby (what?) Period
O.C. baby (O.C. baby)
Ras Kass baby (Ras Kass baby)
U.N.I.Versal (Unique versitile baby)
Uh-huh, ?big loot baby, thuglicious?
Yeah, uhh, set it

Yo, what's poppin baby?  I haven't heard from you lately
We used to conversate day to day on the daily
Remember when I saw you I passed my car I was on my celly
Sittin on the twenty inch Pirelli's
Earring in your belly button caught my eye, oh Nelly
Turned a nigga whole preserve into jelly
You and I rollin a Phillie, but not cheesesteak
My man on my side checkin out the broad's cake
He said the shortie got the bubble like a Lex
I could look at her thighs and fantasize about the sex (mm-hmm)
Check, now I get a call from my nigga Ras and blew
West coast connect (Aiyyo what's crackin doe?) Ahh it's on you
It's like I'm trying to get this dough, so my pocjets ain't hollow
Get my Jake Rollo on with the broads and pop bottles (uhh-huh)
Baby never ever hollow (never, never, bring it nigga)

Chorus: O.C. (singing)

Call me.. don't waste our time if you don't wanna talk to us
Call me.. we got action guar-an-teed
*repeat*

[Ras Kass]
Me and the home-BA-BY, we sniffin some Kurtis Blow
Like "If I Ruled the World" but without the Jheri curl though
Break mind off proper, so O is you with me?
Want two titties in every city, my children jiggy like
a billion little Biggie's -- you dig me?  (That's right)
I'm mashin, Ras Kassin, hoo-bang, WESSYDE
Don't be mad, cause I'm tossin up your woman
It's a party in her panties and I'm the only one comin
Keep money in the bank and kept your girl on her knees
My conversation like birdseed so chickenheads PLEASE
I got game in ten different languages
My name is 24-karat ice, the most dangerous
man you never knew is bangin yo' fiancee
Backseat of a rented Cadillac Elente
I'm Dante, and all I really had to say
Aye mami, tu ?fudio? es grande
Now you can catch me in the broken land
or at the Golden Lady, having strippers swallow my babies
Ain't even the maybe, no hoe pan is savin em
I'm strip searchin bitches like security at the Palladium

Chorus

[O.C.]
Phenomenon worth 4-5-6 when in the mix
Goin once goin twice like mice be tricky
O.C. snatch cheese, you settin the trap?
When it's said and done I put your nipples in my gap
*sssst* That's the sound when I nibble at your cheese nips
Watch it or that'll be the last thing you breathe BEYOTCH
Dealin with pure fuckery, so you can't see self respect
honey stop suckin me you're lovin me

[Ras Kass]
I be Brown, Foxy like Uh-Oh! Uh-Oh!
One for the money, two for the show
Three for more dough a fo'-fo' and five mics
But disrespect mine potnah you're soon to die twice
I rhyme right, so you lime like gum
But in rhyme fights niggaz bite like Mike Ty-son
We be kickin it, peep how a nigga boister
I gets my swerve on rockin the Rolex oyster

Chorus 2X

[O.C.] Call me (3X)</pre>
