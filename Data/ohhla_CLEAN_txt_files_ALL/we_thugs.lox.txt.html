[Styles]
All for one, one for all

[Jadakiss]
This is motherfucking beautiful
Talk to 'em baby...

[Styles]
This for the cold D's that won't snitch

[Jadakiss]
For the murderers that won't miss

[Styles]
For the hustlers that'll front bricks

[Jadakiss]
For the hoodrats that want chips

[Styles]
For the stick-up kids creepin with they Pump's ripped

[Jadakiss]
For lil' shorty with his rhyme books

[Styles]
Black girls going to school, carrying like 9 books

[Jadakiss]
For the hood niggas...
That go to work because parole, but they tryin to be good niggas

[Styles]
For all the poor mothers...
Thats always goin through the struggle, still screamin at the Lord "Love us"

[Jadakiss]
For the ghetto life...
For having to hold your medal tight lookin for a better life

[Styles]
For the family...
For if I'm rich you rich and that shit's a guarentee

[Jadakiss]
For the best of life...
For if I ride you ride the motherfucking rest of life

[Chorus: Styles]
We thugs, my niggas
Ride to the death with my man cause I motherfucking love my niggas
We ghetto, my niggas
Any time, any place, we don't give a fuck we bust metal, my niggas
We gangsta my niggas
You oughta keep your mouth shut
watch what you sayin cause we shank you, my niggas
We D-Block niggas, we don't play games
We just hit you in your frame cause we pop niggas

[Jadakiss]
Aiyyo, yo, I'ma shed blood for mine, that's one ritual

[Styles]
That's how you keep the love unconditional

[Jadakiss]
That's why we the only one the thugs listen to

[Styles]
Bitches buy records but niggas do what bitches do

[Jadakiss]
I know a few dudes doin life bids in jail

[Styles]
And they way smarter then the white kids in Yale

[Jadakiss]
But that how life is

[Styles]
And that how the gun and the knife is

[Jadakiss]
It's a shame but it's real when your enemies like ya

[Styles]
When ya come through and fishtail in Hennesey Viper

[Jadakiss]
Listen, it ain't the rappers it's the rats that worry me

[Styles]
Double R for life, D-Block til they bury me

[Jadakiss] 
Scared niggas shed off
or stand in the back and aim they gat up in the air and...

[Styles]
Let off

[Jadakiss]
Througho niggas tear nigga head off, then let the blood keep drippin...

[Styles]
And just wipe the sweat off

[Chorus]

[Sheek]
Fuck with P, the thug'll come out 

[Styles]
The slug'll come out

[Sheek]
You don't put in enough work, I got chu

[Styles]
No doubt

[Sheek]
They don't want Sheek to wild

[Styles]
Betta cover ya child

[Sheek]
With two guns out the sun-roof...

[Styles]
Stop us now

[Sheek]
Who that kid?  
Black mask on with the latch on, the AK
swing on my shoulder like a Louie bag

[Styles]
You get it in a hurry

[Sheek]
All up in your Burberry

[Styles]
Through your assisstant

[Sheek]
You'll be set fucking kerntary

[Styles]
All y'all do me a favor...

[Sheek]
Walk with me

[Styles]
If you want money or drugs...

[Sheek]
Talk with me

[Styles]
Know I got my niggas my guns

[Sheek]
Now hawk with me

[Jadakiss]
Guess who?  Jada, P, and The Sheek

[Sheek]
Three bricks

[Styles]
Three whips

[Jadakiss]
Three motherfucking ouies a week

[Styles]
Ten spots OT

[Jadakiss]
Two blew off late

[Sheek]
My niggas cop...

[Jadakiss]
Pop and talk, and we applying the pressure

[Sheek]
So when you address us...

[Styles]
