[Playa Hamm]
The P, a playa, a pimp, so add some paper
All combined to give these others the vapors
Now I'm a try and refrain from getting deep like I always do
But if I deepen it's the depth I'm true
But like I said I ain't, yet I'm a still paint a picture
Of a playa, jumping sucker rhyme sayers
Never giving a clue to how I do what I do
But if a sucker was true, he'd be a player, too
It's mind over matter, and babe it don't matter
So when you knock a new one, let your pockets get fatter
A player's style is this one, and if I don't diss one
Sucker in this rhyme, I'm a diss by the thousands
To quote David G, "Used to be is like never was"
If I ain't your blood, then I ain't your cuz
How can I drop any lesser than my predecessor?
The rhymes I blow I blow, cause they don't know

	"They don't know what I know" (Repeat 2x)

[Playa Hamm]
How to blow and throw and grow, as I flow and
Keep it simple, a playa rhyme is a temple
Save it for the true players, staying like that
So stay true and you too can get fat
Like I do, don't cheat yourself
Trueness keeps you in good health, so treat yourself
What I mean is fakers are a dime a dozen
Yeah you though he was true girl, but he wasn't
As true as I am, the one and only Playa Hamm
Comes this way man, and the suckers say "Damn that's dope!"
They ain't got much hope
Don't really know, they can't cope
I am the soap and the water, suckers need bathing
The purity of Penthouse, they ain't fading
Trying for years and years, what to do in 30 minutes
Cause I see all up in it
I'm a legend in your life

	"They don't know what I know" (Repeat 2x)

[Playa Hamm]
I learned a lession bout fessin', proing and not conning
That's why I'm real, busting rhymes beyond any
Sucker tearing shit off, Penthouse ain't soft
But hardcore and a whole hell of a lot more
Quik beats to play with, dance and romance to
Playa rhymes to play, when slapped, take a chance to
Fade a true playa, might wimp when I freak
I keep coming, fading you is like slumming
This is a necessity, consider it prophecy
The coming of a savior here to S-A-V-E
Suckers, from a fate worse than death
The state of being suckers, but for some it's too late
I create rhymes others onlt wish they had
Cause I'm a tad bit better, and much more ingeneous
Sometimes I wish I said what a sucker says
Cause his cap, but suckers luck but
My rap ain't for everyone cause I diss
Yeah I'm concieted, in this game you need it
I won't bow down for props I must drop for
A few, cause a few are true to their game
