Typed by: NLRlyricz@hotmail.com

[Chorus--Master P x4]

I wonder when my homies ride
Cuz when I'm gone ain't no time tah shed tears and cry

[Master P]

Uggggh
Made money from cane, but times done change
I done change my life, but still trapped in the game
A young thug nigga hustlin' full of hennesey
Mama said P keep yah eyes on yah enemies
A lil' skinny nigga made it to the big times
No Limit Soldier still chased by the one time
I feel like it's, it's us against the world
Cuz every young nigga that I know is homie-furall
The game wont change me, but these streets made me
Papa wasn't home so these killas fuckin' raised me
Uggggh

[Chorus--Master P x2]

[Silkk the Shocker]

Now look
I got killas surroundin' me, but I don't know who gon' bust
Niggas aim fo' themselves, so I don't know who tah trust
Friend or foe, enemies or hoe
I don't know who tah dust
Bitches tell me it ain't even, so I don't know who tah fuck
Now look, I ride with ridahs, and plus I kill with killas (Uggggh)
Nigga deal with dealers, and plus I steal with stealers
Now they always told me Silkk, look you be the first tah get killed
But they done fucked up, and let me see my first fuckin' meal
Now I was like shit, I want hundreds in dough
Have two quarters like hundreds of hoes, and rock hundreds of shows
Receive letters from my niggas up in prison tellin' me
At the most come get us, at the least come and visit (Uggggh)

[Chorus--Master P x2]

[C-Murder]

Imagine the pain nigga, would you accept my debt?
Or would you hesitate, retaliation, on my last breath?
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no muthafuckin' people
I won't rest till I see a nigga dead in the concrete
I be a TRU Soulja till I'm buried
I leave 'em worried, gettin' high for my homies in the cemetery
I went from ghettos, tah condos, tah shows with hoes
Tah bustin' at fools with nickle plated fo' fo's
Huh, cuz Im'a ride for my tank dawgz
So put yah name on the wall, cuz I'm comin' tah get all y'all
No Limit niggas be the realest, so rest yah soul
Cuz fo' sho' they gon' feel it (Uggggh)

[Chorus--Master P x2]

[The Gambino Family--Verse 1]

I wonder will my thug niggas ride fo' me?
Nigga I wonder will they'll kill or die with me
I'm just a ghetto child tryna get rich
My home boy hate, man lifes a bitch

[The Gambino Family--Verse 2]

Hold yo' breath young niggas cause these streets a trip
Protect yah own and live long, man lifes a bitch
With my hopes to survive, I plan tah get rich
And if I die, fuck the cryin' and this funeral shit
My only wish is tah see this niggas pain for this shit
Lord forgive me, but revenge is the life that I picked
Homicides, hennesey, it's the life that we lead
And if I die, I got some TRU niggas comin' with me
Muthafuckas (Uggggh)

[Chorus--Master P x4]

Haha, no time tah shed no muthafuckin' tears nigga
When we gone, nigga smile
Some real niggas done moved on
And y'all niggas thats left, it's time tah muthafuckin' ride
Haha</pre>
