[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school.. I don't need no education
I don't wanna be like you.. I don't wanna save the nation (daddy no!)
I just wanna live my life.. everyday a celebration
One day I'ma leave this world.. I'm waitin for the revelation

[Bizarre]
I wanna kill myself!  I'm still debatin
In front of a baptist church, masturbatin
Prayin to Satan - think I'm crazy cause I smoke crack
Live on B with the mac in a two family flat (fuck it)
Tired of gettin hit in the face with a broom
My moms on her period, my dad's in my room (Daddy no!)
I got ten rocks and I need to get out
I sold them in five minutes, at my own damn house (Moms smoke crack)
My poor grandmother, God bless her soul
The bitch got AIDS (aww) she just waitin to die of a cold (hahaha)
There's three things that keep me from bein a Nazi
I'm black, a fag, and my dad's Liberace

[Kon Artis]
No matter how bad the beatin, I went to school cheatin
My dad whooped my ass at a PTA meetin
Stick with school I had to have nuts just to do it
Got bored and became truant
When I had the gall to go I just couldn't do it
I was lured into corners by the peer pressure shit
How would you feel if you was held by the tip of a barrel
Gettin threatened to get your skin ripped to bone marrow
Bet suburban kids never got rushed for their apparel
like me, outcast, last in class
First to leave, when the teacher called on me
Best believe I had somethin up my sleeve

[Eminem]
I've been praised and labelled as crazed
My mother was unable to raise me, full of crazy rage
An angry teenager, nothin can change me back
Gangsta rap made me act like a maniac
I was boostin, so influenced by music I used it
as an excuse to do shit, ooh I was stupid
No one can tell me nothin hip-hop overwhelmed me
to the point where it had me in a whole 'nother realm
It was like isolatin myself was healthy
It felt like we was on welfare but wealthy
Compelled me to excel when school it failed me
Expelled me and when the principal would tell me
I was nothin, and I wouldn't amount to shit
I made my first million and counted it
Now look at, a fuckin drop-out that quits
Stupid as shit, rich as fuck, and proud of it
That's why

[Chorus]

[Swifty McVay]
I was raised with a rifle and mask
Steadily beatin my psychiatrist ass just for askin about my past
(bitch) I was never on that punk shit; fuckin around
can get yo' belove abducted, smothered in blood quick
You couldn't pay Swift to give a fuck
Was crazy like my father, it musta been poison in that nigga's nut
Far as probation, fuck peein in cups
I violate at any time, let 'em see the blunt
I grew up steadily masturbatin inside of cells
Young as hell, havin conversations with myself
You could tell I wasn't lenient, a disobedient
Lynched and slapped teachers, bitch I'm not readin it
You don't know what dawgs go through, a little nigga
Sippin liquor with my old dude, what the fuck you gon' do?
I'm quick to curse you, I told my mother that I'ma hurt you
if you ever again mention a curfew

[Kuniva]
Look, my family ignored me and I don't like that
They don't even listen when I tell them I'll be right back
(Yeah whatever) This nice beautiful house ma, it don't mean shit
Cause you know daddy's a drunk and he don't clean shit
And yesterday he hit me like a grown fuckin man
I couldn't stand up to him, I just ducked and ran
I'm sick of this, I wish on Christmas
that I can get a loaded four-fifth and put a fuckin end to this
(Fuck it) I got no friends and I can't get a bitch
Only thing I have is dirty magazines and sticky fingertips
Nothin to smile about, I'm about to lose my mind
Got me an automatic nine, now I'm ballin out

[Proof]
Wait 'til school's over, pu-pil are people to shoot through
Kids goin cuckoo, with a two-two
Since my friend is this new dude, in this high school
Losin his noodle learn that people don't like you
The football jocks is, spittin on him
Popular kids in school is now pickin on him
Burn out youngsta niggaz now hittin on him
And his teacher in his english class keep flippin on him
And now he's grounded with no allowances
for drinkin forty ounces, cause he was caught by his counselors
And why the fuck I gotta ride the bench coach?
Already got expelled for wearin a trenchcoat
All I ever seen is.. {violence, violence}
Told me to keep silent, stop battin my eyelids
It's apparent that my parents weren't parents at all
That's why I blew out my brains and murdered you all

[Chorus]</pre>
