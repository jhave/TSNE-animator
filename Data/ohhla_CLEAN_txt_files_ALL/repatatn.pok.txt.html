Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Hook - 2x]
Nigga we playing in Texas, driving wreckless
Benz's and Lexus, what the fuck can't respect it

[Big Pokey]
Repatation, is too hard to hold
Game unfold, watch a playa go gold
Sitting swoll, chopping up flow we on the scen-a
Watch me rock the arena, they hollering like some hiyenas
I'm a baller, one you wouldn't believe
Cream Gucci long sleeve, blending in like weave
As I strive to achieve, you see my digits incline
In my prime right now, vocals slicker than slime
I'm like a Sprite with no lime, when my paper is short
On a mash cause we grind, four seat in my vault
Make way I ain't gon play, I'm a H-Town bleeder
Southside stampeder, hulling niggaz with heaters
Tongue quick as a cheetah, spitting game by the liter
Foreign slicing up the feeter, make more paper than Cita
Your beeter ditch sleeper, plus a codeine deeker
Hogging heavy in your speaker, wrecking shows in Topeka

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Pokey]
Boss balling and crawling, and bird hauling is a habit
Kilo surran wrap it, especially neck snapping
Ay I'm the captain, kin snapping
Flossing and flapping, bo'hoggin and back stabbing
Roll over ice won't quit, I'm dropping the kit
Paint dripping like spit, cause you know I'm the shit
Everything I hit, I'ma break when I'm making my moves
Damn fool, checkmate
Lakes paper plates and gates, and even ten nine estates
Nothing but grind and go get it, in my genes and traits
See I'm far from fake, move nothing but straight
28 is the weight, full of crystals and flakes
Each bird I bake, slanging cake for cake
And my pyrexes shake, cause it's money to make
Plus it's broads to break, I can't explain got me gripping the grain
Hogging the lane, leave a stain in they brain mayn

(*talking*)
P-A-T, R.I.P. baby we still putting it down for real
For you baby I love ya, steady representing that
Tell Big Rue I love him baby, still down here
It's going down, thinking bout ya
