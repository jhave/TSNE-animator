[Intro]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein born
Same time my man is murdered, the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Nas]
I ain't mad at you, young king, this unsung song is haunting
Along comes a one son called a offspring
The Earth spins, my Old Earth grin, sung a church hymn
She birthed in September, took my first wind, again, the Earth spins
I jumped in my first Benz, fled out, lead out
Screams got in the game and took bread out
The nerve of these niggaz, weak flow, yo Cole let's murder this sequel
Freedom or jail from Fayetteville to QB though
Cause back when I was young there was massive niggaz
But I passed them niggaz, just being nasty nigga
Military hat, fatigue pants saggin, Henny'd up
Execs asking will he live to see his own release date happen
Straight off the corner with the armor, Arm &amp; Hammer
But I had a appeal, I was a charmer..
Yet still being my momma's son was my biggest honor
This shit was just kinda just a hobby in my project lobby
We was tryna be the Queensbridge Cosby's
But the street life robbed me of that, so I had to put it in raps
And who could I ask for help? Older nigga was gettin mad
But that's the gift and the curse, that's the good and the bad
At least you got Jay, but he already one of the greats
And it's hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great
Nigga I tried and niggaz threw that shit right back in my face
They took my co-sign, but they ain't let me EP their tapes
And when they joint tanked, that's when they point blame
So point blank, young Cole, you won't be the same
The first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures
A big difference between 'em but I get why you said it
Radio records are needed, I just wanted it to bring the warning
Global warming to that cold world you was breathin
That's some advice, I never got
If I don't sell another record, I'll just steady rock
While you was writin down my rhymes I was just tryin to show you
that if you say what's on your mind, you can stand the test of time
Now I'm playin "Born Sinner" loud, saw you live, rock the crowd
Like wow, you made your nigga Nas proud
So you ain't let Nas down...
It's just part of the game, becoming a rap king, my nigga
You ain't let Nas down...
How that sound? Here the crown, pass it to you like nothin, nigga
You ain't let Nas down

[Chorus: Nas]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Slick Rick was like Jesus, G Rap wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
Large Professor's my mentor, that's how the story end, uh</pre>
