Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
(I would kill somebody for you... If I had to
Everyone tried to get out of your way [?], it feels so good)

I just want to fill your head up with obscenities
I have biologically made more than some enemies
I drink and drug randomly
I get so high I don't think I'm landin
I don't crash when I fly reckless abandon
Revenge is a bitch in love with my intentions
I got blood on my hands lookin for vengeance
And if that's a farce [?] I'm picketing [?]
No rest for the wicked then
I don't know what the fuck I just ate but it's kickin in

[Chorus]
Middle fingers up till they put me in the ground
Rollin shit up till they put me in the ground
Gettin fucked up till they put me in the ground
I'll drink till I drown or they put me in the ground
Middle fingers up till they put me in the ground
Stay fucked up till they put me in the ground
I'll drink till I drown or they put me in the ground
My dick is gettin sucked till they put me in the ground

[Verse 2]
Runnin with wolves bein shot at by critics
From helicopters with sniper rifles that kill you for digits
We could bring this beast down
If we organized like Al-Qaeda
While separating the team alpha and team beta
And if the laws of nature shall invade us
And team beta turned out to really be a bunch of omegas
Rally, I moved to Cali
Like NYPD found a corpse I just dumped in a ally

[Chorus]
Middle fingers up till they put me in the ground
Rollin shit up till they put me in the ground
Gettin fucked up till they put me in the ground
I'll drink till I drown or they put me in the ground
Middle fingers up till they put me in the ground
Stay fucked up till they put me in the ground
I'll drink till I drown or they put me in the ground
My dick is gettin sucked till they put me in the ground

[Verse 3]
Something randomly off with me mechanically
See panoramically
I bleed out romantically
Where cows in India were worshiped for infinity
Good thing the ones on my feet were born in Italy
Serendipity they sent the dogs to get rid of me
By the time those bitches caught up
They just started lickin me
Get in your space ship and fly the fuck home girl
You're talkin to a hologram
I live in my own world

[Chorus]
Middle fingers up till they put me in the ground
Rollin shit up till they put me in the ground
Gettin fucked up till they put me in the ground
I'll drink till I drown or they put me in the ground
Middle fingers up till they put me in the ground
Stay fucked up till they put me in the ground
I'll drink till I drown or they put me in the ground
My dick is gettin sucked till they put me in the ground</pre>
