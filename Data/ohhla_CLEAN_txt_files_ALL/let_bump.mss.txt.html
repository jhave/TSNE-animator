[Timbaland]
Gotta cut the music up man

[Missy Elliott]
AAhhhh

[Timbaland]
Gotta cut the music up man

[Verse 1 - Missy Elliott]
I'm-I'm-I'm Mi-Mi-Mi-Missy
Radio play m all the time
Write my own rhymes and I swear I'm fly
This flow here form 83
From a to z you can't fuck wit me
Me and Timbaland man I'll be damn
Remember when Lyte was in love wit Sam
I used to be in love wit this guy name Sam
But to me oh my Gosh he was one in a million
I came through cause I rock the show 
Wack MC's get kicked in the throat
Keep on sleepin cause you think I'm a joke
Uh, Uh, Uh
Let it bump (Let it bump)

[Chorus 2x] [Missy] (Timbaland)
I'm Missy
I'm-I'm
Let it bump (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
Let it bump (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
I'm Missy on the microphone (Gotta cut the music up man)

[Verse 2 - Missy Elliott]
I'm Missy on the microphone
I'm stupid fresh that's the shit I'm on {come on}
Sucka MC's come new in the game
Swear ya hip-hop you just a new jack swing {uh)
Remember when Shantay was live on stage 
Shantay was live on stage
Let me back that shit up 
For ya for ya no hip-hoppers
I'm Missy on the microphone
I'm stupid fresh that's the shit I'm on
Sucka MC's come new in the game
Swear ya hip-hop but don't know Daddy Kane
This time Missy rhyme crazy though
Haters wanna know my antidote
Try to catch up cause ya mind is slow

[Chorus 2x] [Missy] (Timbaland)

[Break] Missy &amp; (Timbaland)
(Gotta cut the music up man)
Me and Timba-Timba-Timba-Timba Timbaland
Me and Timbaland man I'll be damn
(Cut Cut Cut-cu-cu cut the music up man)
(Cut Cut Cut-cu-cu cut the music up man)

[Verse 3 - Timbaland]
Me and Missy come fresh on tracks {oh}
5 albums deep can ya handle that {that}
We came from the basement to platinum plaques {plaques}
We sittin on something this black on black {oh}
Jimmy Dean, he's the engineer {neer}
A nigga been down for about 10 years {years}
Fixin that stuff to make it sound so clear {clear}
Uh, Uh, Uh
Let it bump (Let it bump)

[Chorus 2x] [Missy] (Timbaland)</pre>
