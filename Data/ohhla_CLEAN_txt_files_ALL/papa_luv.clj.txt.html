(Do you got to be right) Second move y'knowI'msayin?
(at all times?) Yeah, all the time, all good

Verse 1:

Uhh, that's the sound of the man
Workin with the mic in my hand
Ready or not here I come
It's another one (Damn, not another one) Yeah
We bring it just like dat (like dat)
Droppin triple platinum flavour on the drum tap
Dog a donut nice and crafty
Poke your lips out sassy when you ask me
Special request is granted (aah)
Head all slanted, (uhh) the gym has planted
(So what you tellin me you're too smooth to pop?)
If it pops should I stop 'fore it drops?
Who knows? Who goes? Who flows?
Me and you? (Yeah) just remember boo
(I promise I'll remember) Everything I do girl
(I promise) I do it for you, word is bond (I know) word is bond

Chorus:

Papa luv it way she does it
(Do you wanna be a player?) Uh
Papa luv it way she does it
(Then you got to have that flavour) Yeah
Papa luv it way she does it
(Do you got to be right)
(at all times) Papa luv it way she does it
*repeat*

Verse 2:

Feel it, hold out your hands (and) open up (damn)
now let it flow from both cups (aw man)
Is he good? (No doubt) All the time, miss
Is he right? (No doubt) One of a kind, miss
Now tell me what you really talkin bout in three words or less
Ladies (get it out) like this
I luv it when I give it to you raw, baby
Hate to hurt but hurtin makes you crazy (crazy)
It's my duty to dig booby
Make a video (Yo, you mean my own movie) Yup
You can star, here we are
There's ya blow, let it flow, you already know
Undress slow, I drop a lil' French  on ya
Then GERONIMO!
You wanna bed debut
Take your time, do it slow, just remember boo

Chorus

Interlude:

This is that skin music, that midnight-rub-you-right skin music (x3)
Top choice if ya choose it

Papa luv it way she does it
(Do you wanna be a player?) Yeah it's everything I luv
(Then you got to have that flavour)
Make it right for ya baby, y'knowI'msayin?
