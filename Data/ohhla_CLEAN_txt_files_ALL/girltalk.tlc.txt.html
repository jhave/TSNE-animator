You see, I had this brother who was mad at me
Cause I told my home girl that he wasn't packin'
Told the truth, so I really don't give a damn
That I spilled the beans on his little short stem man, oh

Some of y'all be foolin' us, big feet, big hands
Just plain big, the sex ain't worth a damn
We women wanna know these things
If y'all got the bat but not the swang

(Put in work) If you don't want the girl to talk
And you don't want your feelings hurt
(Put in work) Cause if you don't
That girl's just gon' go spreadin' the word

Girls talkin', got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Listen, y'all need to know this
That we'll straight up go tell your business
So if you're gonna come you better come with it
If you ain't swingin' just put your tongue in it, oh

Some of y'all be killin' me
Thinkin' you got powers like Austin, but you're more like Mini-Me
And when you finally get your blood flowin'
It be lookin' like a pinky with a glove on it

(Put in work) If you don't want the girl to talk
And you don't want your feelings hurt
(Put in work) Cause if you don't
That girl's just gon' go spreadin' the word

Girls talkin', got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

[Left Eye]
What up papi, you think you got game
I know you're feelin' like my sexual tame can make you happy
You'll remember me, Left Eye, TLC
You got to lick it before you stick it and that's just me
I be killin' em with the Gucci fits and kicks
And you be hurtin' my ears with them lines so swift
You get a new approach, your game's a joke
Co-signin' from the sidelines tryin' to poke
I'm bigger than that, you're small talk, face the fact
You wanna rock the boat a little, well, earn your pass
And it's the last call for alcohol, meet at the bar
Me and my girls doin' it big, we pop stars, yeah

Girls talkin', got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Girls talkin', got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Girls talkin', got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'</pre>
