Throw ya hands up, I make it too hot to hold ya pants up

Inch by inch I wrap the snake 'round you neck

[Dolce]

She don't wanna do nail unless you spendin some dubs
Whisper in my ear I ain't bentin me up

All niggaz I can buck wit givin me hugs

Wipe her lips around a thug, she's extra freak
Summer time head on the beach, the sexy sweet

Mami make more cash in 5 min than you make in a week
She's a hustler baby, she pass that Courvoisier
And you can ask Busta baby

Headed to the club its 'bout to get crazy
She get it from her momma, you can ask Jay-Z

Eyes be lazy, bring a lot of your ladies
