[AG] Now if you need me
[WW] You know I'm here, G
     You got my back, black?
[AG] You know it's like that
[WW] If you need me
[AG] You know I'm here, G
     You got my back, black?
[WW] You know it's like that

[AG] Well it's the A to the jigga jigga G
     Rolling with my brother, no other, P-I-C
[WW] Parter in crime if you didn't catch the rhyme
[AG] My brother, my man, my fam, the whole nine
     And since we're talking about brothers
     There's another dog in the pound (K. Shabazz) is the other
     (On this track) Me and Walli World shared time
     And go willy way back, black, like Grandpa's hair line
     I'm from the ghetto, I will never ever let go
     Always had a def show from the get go
[WW] Hold up, wait, let me jump on the scene
[AG] Yo who you be?
[WW] I'm Walli World from the neighborhood news team
     I put down the rock, now I'm strictly hip-hop
     (Now I) Keep a steady head and stay around the block
     Party Arty how you like it? (Yo the shit sounds fat)
     Yo LB what you doing? (I'm lounging, black)
     Well it's my debut so I gotta stay true
[AG] Will he flip or flop?
[WW] No I'm a dip to the top
     I can never get sick of looking at the brown grits
     I take my pain and flip, I came with the head, now I'm hot
     Yes I had to blow up the spot
     Trade a lay up for tracks and got my rhymes for my jump shot
     And my range is outrageous
     Got mad pull (Memory's full) Too many pages

[AG] Now if you need me
[WW] You know I'm here, G
     You got my back, black?
[AG] You know it's like that
[WW] If you need me
[AG] You know I'm here, G
     You got my back, black?
[WW] You know it's like that

[AG] First things first, you know I burst with the herbs
     On my own like a roughneck with the mental of a damn nerd
     The gear I wear is only rough and right
     Gave the Timbs a break, sport Northflakes with construction tights
     I get hype and light blunts with my crew
     Smoke a spliff with Ice if Wu got the .22
     And mama duke gets nuff respect
     Because she kept me in check, one deep, now that's a roughneck
     Dre's the best, you'd better say yes, or test
     The G double O-D-F-E double L-A-S
     I'm incredible, making MC's edible
     Sell out is what I'll never do, get paid is what I'd better do
     And while my brother's in the federal
     I'm making LP's, collecting G's for my revenue
[WW] Now so I was bombing
[AG] Brothers are dying for glory
[WW] A disaster
[AG] Happily ever after
[WW] We don't know that story
     My brother's gone, I got to get work
     Dressed in my boots and my sweatshirt, I'm rolling with the network
     The new, yes I'm down with neighborhood news
     Jordan was on top, now Walli World rules
[AG] Hanging with the Goodfellas, smoking marijuana
[WW] Big ups to Afrika Bambaataa and mt brother Kale Kinyata
     I got a SP-12 from the brother Show
     I gotta flow to let them others know
     I told you before that I had to stay true
     Walli World is out, now how'd you like my debut?

[AG] Now if you need me
[WW] You know I'm here, G
     You got my back, black?
[AG] You know it's like that
[WW] If you need me
[AG] You know I'm here, G
     You got my back, black?
[WW] You know it's like that</pre>
