y'kno it go down fuckin' with the B.G. nigga
don't act like you don't know...
...It goes down when me or my clique feel played
Uptown you off yo P's and Q's - off wit'cha head
The clique I run with, most definately bout dumb shit
Load the clips up and release, ta the fuckin' gun clip
I'm a made nigga - so y'kno when BGeezy got beef
It's drama time, ain't no way them bitch niggaz could see
Since '93 I been ridin' strapped up four deep
No bullshittin' nigga - I blose the whole street
Sendin' hollows at that ass ta make ya head leak
Got Frank in the gang - some can see him in white sheets
It Ain't no stoppin' it ain't no chillin' when they k' with me
It ain't so squashin' it ain't nothing you could say ta me
Since L.T. got killed - murder it miss the way ta be
My people say I need ta stop with that mentality
I know they right but fuck them niggaz - They don't love me
Now watch how many niggaz ride if they touch me

(Hook - [B.G.])
It goes down when me or my clique feel played
Uptown - you off ya P's and Q's - off wit'cha head
It goes down when me or my clique feel played
On V.L. - you off ya P's and Q's - off wit'cha head
It goes down when me or my clique feel played
In that Nolia - you off ya P's and Q's - off wit'cha head
It goes down when me or my clique feel played
Uptown - you off ya P's and Q's - off wit'cha head

[B.G.]
C-A-S-H-M-O-N-E-Y - that's my clique nigga
Don't you forget nigga
You could, take us, for a, joke if you want
And, you could, end up, tied up, in the trunk
And, we ride with shit like AR-15's
And ready ta whack, the first enemy that seen
We don't play no games on no terms wodie
We a, leave ya, pa-le pa-le - swell whol-e
We riders baby, dome checkers and wig splitters
We bout it baby, all I fuck with is real niggaz
You beef with me if you want a early deat' nigga
Your coward plead - if you don't wanna get wet nigga
I'm runnin' dope shops - rock shops what ever
I was taught do - what I gatta do for the cheddar
Pledge ya last bitch first is how I play it my nigga
Dare me ta cock my k' and watch how I spray it my nigga

(Hook - [B.G.])

[B.G.]
Please, don't, make me feel played
Cuz I garantee that within the week you come up dead
B-Geezy - Juve - Turk and Weezy
A jump out a black van and I set the whole street
I, get excited, when I'm in beef
I gas up and strap up and ride all week
When, you, get, caught, down bad
It's *blaka-blaka-blaka-ratta-tat-tat*
I do a nigga something - his family gon' remember
Find his body in July - head in September
I'm a lil' raw nigga, very low down nigga
Something you never saw straight from Uptown nigga
Nut's hang low ta where they drag on tha flo'
Got coke and I know - have ten locks on ya doo'
Cuz I'm comin' in - without a warrant - don't break it off
Right there your head I'ma take it off nigga
It goes down when me or my clique feel played
Uptown - you off ya P's and Q's - off wit'cha head
It goes down when me or my clique feel played
On V.L. - you off ya P's and Q's - off wit'cha head
It goes down when me or my clique feel played
In that Nolia - you off ya P's and Q's - off wit'cha head</pre>
