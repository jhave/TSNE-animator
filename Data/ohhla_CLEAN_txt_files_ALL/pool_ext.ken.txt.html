Faded (drank), faded (drank)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now I done grew up round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
that I'ma get fucked up, filling up my cup, I see the crowd move
Changing by the minute, and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Interlude]

[Kendrick Lamar]
"OK, now open your mind up and listen me Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now, and I'm hoping to lead you to victory Kendrick"
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison abusing my limit
I think that I'm feeling the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feeling, the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice, then apparently
I'm over-influenced by what you are doing, I thought I was doing the most, then someone said to me

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Kendrick Lamar - repeat 2X]
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one-hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you, bang?
Two chopper, two-hundred shots, bang

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

"Sherane"
(Pool full of liquor then you dive in, in, in, in) {*reversed*}
"Sherane, Sherane, Sherane"
(W-Watch 'em all f-flock)
Aww man; "Sherane"
(Girls wanna play, play, play)
Where is she taking me?
(P-Pool full of liquor, I'ma d-i-i-iive in it)
Where is she taking, me?

[Kendrick Lamar]
All I, all I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me do that sound familiar
If it do then you're like me: making excuse that your relief
is in the bottom, of the bottle, and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep 
and never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough...

[Skit]
"They stomped the homie out over a bitch."
"K-Dot, you good, blood? Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off."
"That nigga's straight man, that nigga ain't trippin'. We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'mma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ----'s lap, and he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon' pop that bitch too!"
"Wait hold up, aye I see somebody!"
{*Car door opens; gunshots fired*}
"Aha! Got them niggas, K-dot, you good? L----, you good?"
"Yeah, blood, I'm good. Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say something - Dave?
These bitch ass niggas killed my brother!"</pre>
