There ain't nothin' to do in my home town 
So I grab my remote and I plant myself down 
Suckin' down cheese balls by the pound 
Gonna watch TV till my brain melts down 

I got no wife and I got no life 
But I got my remote so I'm set for the night 
Never shower so I smell like rotten eggs 
Cobwebs growin' out the side of my legs 
'Cause I haven't gotten up in sixteen years 
Missin' a show is one of my worst fears 
My father wants to know what kind of drugs I'm on 
I don't get up to eat or even go to the john 
Even if I wanted to I doubt I could 
Because my legs feel like they're made of petrified wood 
Here in the same place in the same slouch 
My butt is fused to the cushion of the couch 
Dropped out of school in the second grade 
Got a ten foot screen, got a glass of lemonade 
Got a jar next to me for when I have to pee 
This is the way life was meant to be 

There ain't nothin' to do in my home town 
So I grab my remote and I plant myself down 
Suckin' down cheese balls by the pound 
Gonna watch TV till my brain melts down  

Rats and roaches run around the room 
I forgot what it's like to be in any other room 
I stare at the tube and I never make a sound 
'Cause the TV set never lets me down 
Talk shows, talk shows, all day long 
With stuff like this, how can I go wrong? 
Like cross dressin' Nazis who live on Gummy bears 
And Elvis impersonators singing in their underwear 
Games, game shows all day and night 
I live for shows like The Price Is Right 
I'm still waitin' to see Bob Barker cringe 
When a fat woman pulls the big wheel off the hinge 
Wait, what's happening, this has to be a joke 
Oh, God, no, please, my remote is broke 
These are brand new batteries I can't  believe they blew 
Now what the hell am I supposed to do? 
There ain't nothin' to do in my home town 
So I grab my rerote* and I plant myself down 
Suckin' down cheese balls by the pound 
Gonna watch TV till my brain melts down

[*rerote, n. (re-ROTE): 1.how a person says "remote" 
after years of sitting in front of a television 
due to the brain damage caused by doing so.]
