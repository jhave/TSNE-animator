Uh-huh, oh (Oh)
Uh-huh, oh
So So Def
(I've got to have it)
See this is what it's all about right her
Understand me see my life's real
I don't know about yours
Everything I do is an event
(I've got to have it)
Nas, Monica, and me
(I've got to have it)
When it comes to my honeys in the strip club (oh)
Sumpin' on dubs in the middle of the block
Like what? (What?)

[Nas](Monica)
When you see me with the crispy fade
Icing it out, glowing with the lights is out (hmm)
Yo say my name! (Ooh)
When you see a Bentley or Ferrari, a Mazuradi
It's probably me (ooh, oh)
Say my name!
When your hear this song bump in the club
When you're chillin' on the corner with your thugs
Say my name!
I make it hot and take your block
Who they wanna be and hate they not
Yo say my name!
When your girl don't call you when you beep her
And you hit it and her thing feel deeper
Say my name!
Pull on her hair, spankin' her rear
While I'm in 'em bitches all I wanna hear is you say my name
Squeeze my gats beef is done
Police come you know the game
Don't say my name
Dipped out crazy, Timbs chicken and gravy
Q.B., Dupri baby

1 - [JD] (Monica)
    When it comes to the clubs packed, Cristal flowin'
    (I've got to have it)
    When it comes to homes plushed out chrome stuck out in traffic
    (I've got to have it)
    When it comes to a neck full of glow
    And a check full of O's, you know
    (I've got to have it)
    When it comes to my honeys in the strip club
    Sumpin' on dubs in the middle of the block
    Like what? Say my name!
    (I've got to have it)

[Monica]
Gotta have my tied up Iceberg Gucci Rolley
Bezzled up, bezzled up
Gotta have me a double O
With a six in the front
And a bump-bump in the truck
Gotta have me an escalade
My house is laid
A man that keeps my bills paid
My records play every day
What can I say?
I've got to have it

Repeat 1

[JD]
When you see a black do-rag through the tint
Of a black Bent going too fast
Say my name
When you talk about longevity
And niggas who know how to keep gettin' that cash
Say my name
When you're sick of your songs
Sittin' on the right
And wanna know what the top feel like
Say my name
If you wanna know what being hot feel like
And shuttin' down the spot feel like
Say my name!
JD from the home where the bowls get thrown
And the dough get gone real quick like
Keep niggas sick like 40 karats and a chain
Foolish ain't it?
Say my name!
Everything you did I've done did double
If you hate to see flash then your ass is in trouble
Scram now and don't look back
Cause until I die it's like that

Repeat 1
