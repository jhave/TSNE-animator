[Intro]
Ah, it's a plane, it's a bird, it's a zombie, hahaha

[Verse 1: Meech]
The highest high, I'm Ayatollah
Rubber on my dick, allergic to baby strollers
Blue dream, that amazing odor
Ant is a pyrex I'm the coke and the baking soda
Juice be the blue flame that create the whole thing
Rap game, crack game, apparently the same thing
If this was eighty-something I'd be in shell toes
Gucci link fat rings ashy ass elbows
Saving every penny trying to get up out this hell hole
For my super-thugs, hustlin' up off the jail phone
Life's a battle fool you better have your weapon drawn
How could I be scared of death, bitch, I'm already gone
Money on my mind, your bitch on my zipper
Breaking up pound after pound, THC on every finger
You gon' need a boost from God to get as high as me nigga
Excuse me, I meant to say as high as we nigga

[Bridge]
Flatbush Zombie, A$AP Mobbin
Hit a killswitch and put an end to any problem

[Verse 2: Juice]
Hash and weed, hash in a bong
Got weed by the ton, got blow by the load
If you wanna get throwed, A$AP Ant got the po-tion
Three fly ass bitches with we
Double-cupped them double D's
Hi-high nigga, hi-high livin'
Three young ass niggaz running shit, no slippin'
Gotta know the game, gotta know the lane, gotta know the pain
No handouts, ain't shit easy
Dark shades, on my Eazy-E
Got bitches on my mini-me
And you niggaz in the rap game can't relate
I'm real pimpin', no fornicating
Fuck what you heard, I'm goin' ape
Smokin Grape Ape, fuck your mixtape, that's a weed plate
Zombie style
A$AP, never mind these clowns
I love brain, zombie style, never mind these clouds

[Interlude: A$AP Ant]
Juice pass me the weed, Meech where the acid at?
A$AP Ant in this bitch, uh

[Verse 3: A$AP Ant]
I'm a demon triple beaming, painting pictures rapin' Mona Lisa
Blood sheets, creepin for the panties
With the collar danny's
Killin bitches sniffin' panties
Willy wonka candy semen
Three niggaz, one bitch, one clip
One brain dead girl
Off your mind leave your brains on your moms
Razor blades dipped in bleach
Tear your skin to pieces
Dump the body in Tennessee
Highway getaway OJ bronco
Cap it baby drive em off the bridge
Look into my eyes, vivid tears
I see fear, ya'll some fuckin' queers
Grow a fuckin' pair, I'm 'posed to be here
'Posed to be dead, overdosed on shrooms
Let's cruise, drive by on site
Ride like a bike, for my zombie homies kill tonight

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
A$AP niggaz we aliens
Cold-blooded nigga, reptilian
Acid, acid, ambiens
Only fuck a bitch if she lesbian
Trill niggaz run the city, got the key on lock
Juice got the juice, nigga Meech gon' pop
Addie in the Caddy with the heat on cock
When a Mac go (blakk) cuz the beef don't stop, nigga
My name is, that pretty motherfucker
From the land of the lost of the gully and the gutta
See the Preds made a toast for the honey and the butter
Only die for two things, that's my money and my mother, motherfucker!
Niggaz know my name, did I stutter?
Niggaz know me, man I keep it one hunna
I'm a stunna
Hood By Air for the summer
Toast to the God and it cost nine hunna
So-so ru-run up if you wanna
Mac in the backpack, right by the Macbook
And I rep that Harlem
And my Zombie niggaz straight out of Flatbush</pre>
