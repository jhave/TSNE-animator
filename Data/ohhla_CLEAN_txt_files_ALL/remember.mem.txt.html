[Chorus]
(Swollen)
Who's thick?
Swollen... la-la-la-la
Yeah, the pockets fat
Swollen... la-la-la-la
The beats bang
Swollen... la-la-la-la
Look at that, see that ass
Swollen... la-la-la-la
Pump, pump, pump, pump it up, but don't turn us down
New Shit!
Swollen... new sheriff's in town

[Verse 1: MadChild]
Bout to show you something brand new
I ain't fronting but there ain't nothing I can't do
Listen man I'm telling you, you can too
Man you got no idea what the heck it took to get me here
I'm talking big hockey bags dragged back and forth
Bring it down South and get more from back up North
So I can stack up more and ? with force
26 inch rims, Cadillac of course
Now that I'm single this shit takes practice
Everyday a new attractive actress on my mattress
Stress relief, I'm a basket case
Give me a six-pack breast implants and a plastic face
Ass banging with them stupid thighs
I like my girls petite and super sized
I got love man that shit's real
I just got to take a few more laps around the field

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Moka Only]
You bout to know me in a big way
Yo, it's Moka Only, the name that all the kids say
Hey, I hope you know the game is in for a change
You love me cause I'm always known to spit strange
I get strange with it plus I get change
Enough to cop the H2 and the Range
Player I don't hate you or the game
Y'all hate yourself because you play the same
I mean fuck around its time to change the rules up
Y'all can still move your ass we got the new stuff
It's evidence on the track you know the crew, what?
Swollen super extra like my new truck
The 26 inch spinners the don't rub
Making all the jaws drop outside the club
I know you want to sing along do it up
But you got to spread the word tell them who you love

[Chorus]
The crew is called Swollen, remember the name
The heat that we holding, the Members spit flames

[Verse 3: Prevail]
Yo its unfair to put us in the same class
Before the ice melts I drain the whole glass
Nothing but fumes are left, I'm off and half-cocked talking under my breath
Girls in the bathroom perfuming their chest
So when they walk through the club damn she's fresh
They shit off the wall like zero gravity
We hit you all we don't spare no casualties
Glasses clink, asses shake some chick wearing pink rocking boots made of snake
Cop this disc and tell the disc jock to let this rock til its two on his wrist watch
There's a new sheriff in town, don't make my pistol whistle like sweet Georgia Brown
We got this song stuck in your ear
With the sound so original there's nothing to clear

[Chorus]</pre>
