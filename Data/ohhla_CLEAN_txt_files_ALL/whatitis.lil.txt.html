[Lil' Mama - Intro]
I'm what it is..
I'm what it is..
I'm what it is..
Ha-hah, eh-hah, eh-hah, ha ha
I'm what it is.. (What it is) what it is (what it is)
What it is (what it is) what it is (what it is)
What it is (what it is) what it is (what it is)
Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha - I'm WHAT IT ISSS!

Fresh for the block, Friday nights, party nights
Fresh for the block, 'cause everybody in the party
straight from the block, but what they gon' stop?
My Netti wind is sick, my heel toe wit twist-a
360, this is - (NON-PLAYWITABLE!)
My doo-wop is sick, hit that then hit the
360, this is - (FIVE STACKS CRITICAL!)
And I ain't tryna brag to you (no!)
And I ain't definitely tryna keep UP, 'cause I'm ahead of you
Walk, krump, and I murder you
Magic with a verse-a, dude
And that's just somethin that ain't changed yet, straight wreck
on anybody talkin material 'cause I take checks
So let's, make this a foreclosure
Been where you nev-ah, been real and the game's ov-ah!
Y'all mo' the, crust of these rap chicks (YEAH!)
Peep what it is, but they not like this - I'm WHAT IT ISSS!

[Chorus: T-Pain] {Lil' Mama}
She fine (she fine), she sexy, cool
And don't n'am dudes know what to do with her (know what to do with her)
{I'm WHAT IT ISSS!} All these chicks can keep hatin
but they know that they can't fool with her (they can't fool with her)
{I'm WHAT IT ISSS!} She hit the spot and shut it DAOWN! (DOWN!)
No messin around, strike a pose, girl
(Aw yeah, aw yeeeeaaaah) Strike a pose, girl!
...Now get off, GET OFF!

[Lil' Mama]
(I'm WHAT IT ISSS! - WHOA) "She's so aggressive, the girl pressin"
(I'm WHAT IT ISSS! - WHOA) "But she's a wack adolescent"
(I'm WHAT IT ISSS! - WHOA) Successin is my only mission
It's impossible for anybody, come and get it
Definition of raw talent and I write all bars
Flay cars in the hood they call me No Holds Barred
Born star like my lil' brother ?Onstar?
And I will, eat you rappers plus the candy's inside
Lil' Mama nicka-nicknamed Dharma {?}
I'ma truth in the booth, +Shawty Gets Loose+
And they way I eat guys so mean 
"Lil' Mama, YOU'RE SO MEAN!" - SO?!
I like to rock the party and I like to rock the show
When they step into my league, I gotta use all force
when you START tryin to play with my brain like I'm crazy
Oh baby! That's when it's rock-a-bye baby!

[Chorus]

[Lil' Mama]
Why don't you come around here, dawg? 
Look for me, type ease in bees we breeze
Pass your team, 'cause I been to where you sightseen
Nothing that you do or could ever do to excite me
Can't see, like we know maybes or more than likely
She gon' have flow {?}, which means I got flow sick disease
Which means I have no sympathies, no antedote, y'all heard of me!
Please, wit these CB-4 chicks
'fore I get up on some see mo', feed me mo'
This is what I been sayin for some time now (time now)
If anybody got an object-ion, time's now!
Mo' fitted and mo' stroll 'cause she's ON
She's on  - (wha?) SHE'S ON!
Wake up in the mornin, go to sleep at dawn
My mama shoulda named me Dawn, ah-uh-uh, ONNN!!
Either way, I woulda been a trip, the way I flip {YEAH!}
the script and switch then get down like this - I'm WHAT IT ISSS!

[Chorus]

["I'm what it is" ad-libs and chants continues 'til the end of the song]</pre>
