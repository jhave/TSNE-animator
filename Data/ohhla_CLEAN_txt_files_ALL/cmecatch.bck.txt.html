[Verse 1: All Star]
I neva been fronted, if I got it - then I bought it
Nigga, certified hustle-a, neva been caughted (Yuh!)
Traffican' and trappin' got me stackin' up these bucks
Nigga, I was grindin' hard when Warren Sapp was with +The Bucks+ (Oooooowwhh)
Nigga, we can git it crackin', really I don't give a fuck
Call Scrap' and cherk Buck Like, "Let's go hit 'em up!"
From tha -A- to Cashville, G-Unit, G's up
And we talk to much heat to eva-eva freeze up (Holla!)
Keep a hammer on my waist, a banana on tha cake
I'm just happy to see 21 candals on tha cake
And if I'm eva down bad, it's a bandana on my face
I'll stomp bitch, I don't give a damn 'bout a case (Fuck!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lil Scrappy]
Yo.. (Aye..)

I'll smoke-a blunt in front of tha police like it's legal (C'mon!!)
Stand on tha squad car screaming "Fuck tha people!"
Man dem niggas hear me, then can git it like we do (Yeeaaah!!)
Perp for tha low, peel fo' you roll
Gotta go and hustle, 'cause my pokets on low
Got a couplah niggas dat's gon' flip em O's
It was born in my blood, I'm gon pimp em ho's (Fo' Sho'!!)
When you see me in tha street, yeah I did it fo' tha struggle ho'
Now on my time, I'm gon' do it fo' my daughter tho
Even if I have to rob and lay a nigga on tha flo' (Aye, Aye)
You don't want no problems - just gimme what I came fo' (G-Uniit!!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Posted up, on dis corna like whateva

On Tuesdays and Thursdays they say tha vikes rollin'
We see 'em ride by, but we act like we don't know 'em
They know they we ain't gone, see dis is our hood (What!!)
We wear these bandanas, not 'cause they look good (Fo' Real!)
Let's do dis fo' big took it, them niggas in the pen
Tha ones dat won't neva see these fuckin' streets again (Yeaaah!!)
So fuck tha D.E.A. and fuck tha F.B.I.
We traffican' dis shit, up until tha day we die (Bu-bu-bu-buck!)
Some say I'm out my mind, I say I'm about my grind (What!!)
Dat's why when I tell 'em I bought a phantom
They know dat I ain't lyin' (Aye!!)

[Chorus]
