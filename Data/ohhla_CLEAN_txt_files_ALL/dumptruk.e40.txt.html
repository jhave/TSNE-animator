Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)

[Verse 1]
Easy back it up uh, easy back it up uh
Easy back it up uh, easy back it up uh
Easy back it up bring it back come rewind
Double D top, 43 inch behind
Booty duty onion booty
Baby do your dance drop it like a hot potato
Do a full point stance both hands on the ground ass in the air
I'm a make you feel it through your pants, hand full of hair
I met this stick ass broad her name was Momo
She live in Sacramento in the town
I was on a pine of tuna while squeezing coronas
She was on a tree took her home and I bong bong
God damn the sex was good, she was from the hood
Got me hard as wood hit it like I should
I ain't gotta front get it understood
I do what I want, suckers do what they could

[Chorus: x2]
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)

[Verse 2]
A regular party is some fake shit
Come find me where the girls dance naked, try
I wanna get my dick sucked in the VIP in the stripclub
Looked around and found me one
My flavour I'm trying to pound on some
She got nice titties (nice titties), long weave kinda pretty
She turned around, damn, too much booty in the pass
I told her shake that monkey! I'm feelin' this shit
It's so funky
Somebody said that's right baby girl bounce that back side
It ain't real that's her new butt
I don't give a fuck bitch toot it up

[Chorus: x2]
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)

[Verse 3]
Back that ass up like a dump truck
We don't go crazy in the club, we go dumb fuck
Look, looking at her dance I know shawty want it
I had to go crazy E-40 on it
And shawty stupid bad but her man a mart'
Gon' tell his stupid ass you had a change of heart
You don't smoke weed girl you better start
Then she back that ass up in paralel

[Verse 4]
Like them big booty girls with that long hop
Said she a cali girl but she never ever duck
She be traveling she be say coming from Brazil
Looking like a bag full of hundred dollar bills
And ah, shaking like a B12 in the air
Chilling with me, we smoke a bill out of gas
Now let me see you back it up like a dump truck
We're looking for a high girl we don't give a fuck

[Verse 5]
Shorty I might be your first but I will not be your worst
And if you give me a chance I bet I make your shit squirt
I take my dick out my pants and then she lift up her skirt
I told her back her the fuck at me I put that thing in reverse
Now can I drop a reverse, hell yeah
Beat the pussy up why you understand with
Shawty said I'm crazy as hell and she's scared
But she said it feels real good oh yeah

[Chorus: x2]
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)
Back it up like a dump truck (dump truck, dump truck)</pre>
