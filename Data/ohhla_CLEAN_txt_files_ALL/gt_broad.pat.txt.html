[Project Pat]
She's a freaky young gal a bi-sexual
But a hustler though and will sell some snow
Wit dat' juicy fat thang I can't let you go
What she doing mane wit' all that I bet you know?
Baby girl takes dem trips down to Mexico
Get dem birds and dat herbs and will see her doe
Clock ticks like her brain when she sceme a plot
Set playas up for change and recive alot
My thang staying on hard make that coochie pop
A suck me up til she get the last goocy drop
The shake club never had much to offer her
A dike broad get none cuz it's boss wit her
And it's boss wit' me why you be asking when twirking
She don't claim pimp but she'll have ya' working
All it's certain she been dere and did dat'
Could be corporate lawyer or a hood rat

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
She's a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
catching me wit' the doe and she'll take the charge

[Project Pat]
Razor blade in ya mouth green stuff in ya' stuff
Philly blunts in ya' purse but dat ain't enough
Turning liqor bottles up cha' mane as we dip
Turn right turn left each corner take a sip
Say wussup to the big pussy click in Hine Park
Learna and Leonara and those who got hard
Staying down wit your dogs till they let your dogs go
Jail house like a dog house dog y'ain't know
Everbody need somebody real on there team 
No letters no visitation make you mean 
Make you wanna think everybody left you for dead 
And ya' gal dat' you love out dere giving head
What the past don't be thinking bout the things that I did
I need money for some commisaries can ya' dig
Taking chances with us so we can live 
Put some rims on my car shoes for the kids

[Chorus] - repeat</pre>
