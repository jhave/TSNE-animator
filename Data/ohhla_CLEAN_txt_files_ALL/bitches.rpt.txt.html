(Chorus X2-Butch Cassidy)
A bitch ain't nothin to me
Now let me tell you cuz I'm quick to put them ho's on the street
Make 'em bow down on they knees and do whatever
Cuz I'm clever ho's give what I need

(Verse 1-Kurupt)
Hey bitch, what you lookin at me strange fo'
Askin me if a nigga drive a Range Rov'
Whatever reason you may have on your mind
It must be coke or grass on your mind
Kickin back like you lost all your mind
I'ma put my foot in your behind
Until you got footprints on your behind
I'm cool at the club
I love it when the ladies do what they love
Pass around hugs
Whatever she done to get the ones ain't my concern
I'm live in the club, nickel sacks and dubbs
If you wanna strip ain't my concern

(Chorus X2-Butch Cassidy)
A bitch ain't nothin to me
Now let me tell you cuz I'm quick to put them ho's on the street
Make 'em bow down on they knees and do whatever
Cuz I'm clever ho's give what I need

(Verse 2-Roscoe)
Let's get on the good foot and do the bad things
Prayin donkey to Chinese shag swing
I'm a young arso' powers get tossed for hours
If I'ma do ya I'm use the Kamasucha when we shaggin
Have ya braggin, to all your homegirls
About this young thug who can rock ya world
Tellin 'em all how you wish you could be my girl
And I got skirts from the bottom to the top of the world
See I'm on top of the world, why you mad at her?
Get used to it I'm toppin him girl
Pop in love with the girls, and I do it just like Kurupt
I wanna see you happy, doin what you love
Especially when what you love is me
Makin sure I keep plenty bud and bubbly
You know the rules ma, it's just the thug in me
Now pay pimpin, or raise up from underneath, ya dig?

(Chorus X2-Butch Cassidy)
A bitch ain't nothin to me
Now let me tell you cuz I'm quick to put them ho's on the street
Make 'em bow down on they knees and do whatever
Cuz I'm clever ho's give what I need

(Verse 3-Butch Cassidy)
Bitch been sad before, but some niggaz ran just ain't learnin though
I don't want your ho so tell me what you fightin fo'
Once we all were cool but now he stressin got him actin like a fool
I gotta keep my distance now, it ain't my fault that ho's confused

(Chorus X2-Butch Cassidy)
A bitch ain't nothin to me
Now let me tell you cuz I'm quick to put them ho's on the street
Make 'em bow down on they knees and do whatever
Cuz I'm clever ho's give what I need</pre>
