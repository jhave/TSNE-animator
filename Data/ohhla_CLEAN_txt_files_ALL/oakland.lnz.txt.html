[Yukmouth]
Yo yo, I'm from the land of the playas, slick talkas, and colla poppas
Narcotics, and boss ballas, pit bulls and rottweilers
Niggaz wit gold teeth, old schools on gold feet, killas, and O.G's
Task postil the police
Mac Arth to foothill, East 14th
Sobrante park, woodfield, Plymouth, and walnut street
From the ville to seminary to the rollin 20's
Wit ghetto celebrities
Like Big Feek and Little D
See the east bay dragon is the home of the panthers
Where niggaz slang tons of crack and feds catch it on camera
Throw you in the slammer
It's the home of $hort and Hammer
Boss ballas move to Atlanta
Niggaz stole our grammar
That's my ropas, that's my nephew
That's my weeples, that's my nizzle
Please believe me
Go fa sheezy
Off the hizzle
Do ya thizzle
With my niggaz ridin dopefiend rentals
Rock presidentials, slang crack, pack pistols
Every track got sizzle

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Cuz I'm a Raider, Oakland Raider
From the bay to L.A. to Las Vegas
Cuz I'm a playa, a boss playa
and if you wit me pop ya colla shake dem hatas
I'm a Raider

[Knumskull]
I'm a Raider, just like my niggaz befo' me
But I was a thief wit out the open face gold theeth
And En Vogue was some fine ass Oakland Raidettes
And Too $hort was the first Oakland Raider on the set
Now Pooh-Man was a Raider when he was "Fuckin Wit Dank"
And Askari X was a Raider when he was a "Ward of the State"
And Dangerous Dame was a Raider when he was callin hoes names
But I know
From the Lake on Sundays, to the five O
Now we to Eastmont wit the sideshows
But it's fun, and I'm famous, but I aint tryna die tho
Niggaz be goin out in a gang but not I tho
If I have to go back to dope, I'm slangin fo survival
Now Dru, pimp he do
If you hoe-in then he pimpin you
Tried it fo' 30 days, I aint lyin I aint wit it dude
A baby sittin job, Oh my God that's a job
But I still wanna do it cuz that's 100% I

[Chorus]

[Knumskull]
Hieroglyphics been Raiders from "'92 to Infinity"
Some unda ground shit that just shook the fuckin industry
And Humpty with his gone ass, a Raider in his own right
The whole D.U. camp'll get you amped on sight
Now Mystic, she the only female Raider I know
You the shit baby girl, I'm just lettin you know
And last but not least
Tupac Shakur nigga Rest In Peace

[Yukmouth]
I'm from the city of dope, the town of the crack
I'm from the city of pimps, the town of the mac
East Oakland!
Heat-totin, ebonics speech broken, keep jokin
The Luniz bout to have the streets loc'in
Down South y'all keep smokin hay, we got the killer 'dro and h
Heroin and kilos for days
It's the city of the Warriors, the home of the A's
Where niggaz get sideways
Shoot outs from highways nigga
East Oakland Bitch!
I'm a Raider!

[Chorus]

[Knumskull]
3x Krazy, Cydal, rest in peace Eclipse
Bad N-Fluenz, rest in peace Rappin' Ron
Ant Banks, Seagram, rest in peace my nigga
Black Dynasty, Delinquents
Richie Rich, 415
MC Ant, the Coup, Point Blank, E-A-Ski, Steady Mobbin
All yall niggas is Raiders
Raider, muthafuckas, what?!!

[Mark Curry]
Damn, what about me? It's Mark Curry baby
I'm not a Oakland Raider? God dayum
I'm the first muh fucka on T.V.
I was the first one that did HBO
First one did Apollo; I can't get qualified
bein Hall of Pimpology as a Oakland Raider What?
Uh, I'm the first one on dubs what? I'm a Oakland Raider baby
That's right representin the town, East side Oakland
You know how we do it East Side O, nigga straight up take yo hoe
I was all day long, you know how we do it in the town, Crystal, Big dank
Dats the way we roll ol school sittin on 20's
It don't make no difference; floatin, doin it all
Ghetto nigga from the Eastmont Mall</pre>
