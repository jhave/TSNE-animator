1, 2 Gangrel's coming for you
Gangrel, can you come out and play?
3, 4 better lock your doors
Gangrel, can you come out and play?

I won't stop 'til I see blood
I won't stop 'til I see blood
I won't stop 'til I see blood
I can't stop 'til I see blood
(repeat)

I got that gleam in my eye
I'm straight from the grave
Dress in all black, I'm looking for a slave
Call me the reaper, you won't live to tell
Call me Gangrel, I'm straight out of hell
I need blood, I'm lookin for a victim
The Brood, I'm with 'em
Lets go get 'em
Lock up your doors, and throw away the key
You can't run from me, look at my teeth
I'm sleeping in a casket, and kill at night
I know it ain't right, but I hate the sunlight
And no you're not dreaming, this is not a nightmare
Cause when you wake up, guess what?
I'm still there!!!

I won't stop 'til I see blood
I won't stop 'til I see blood
I won't stop 'til I see blood
I can't stop 'til I see blood
(repeat)

You can't see me, not even in the mirror
My reflection is dead, you just took your last breath
Don't call the police, instead call a coroner
Blood got drained out your neck on the corner
The sun goes down, the freaks come out
We bum rush your city, the Brood with no pity
Silver bullets, triggers we pull it
Nothin' can save ya, go meet your maker
Run and I catch ya, fight and I hit ya
Surrender your soul, it's murdered and cold
That click with no love
You might call us thugs
Dont give us no hugs, cause we want your blood

I won't stop 'til I see blood
I won't stop 'til I see blood
I won't stop 'til I see blood
I can't stop 'til I see blood
