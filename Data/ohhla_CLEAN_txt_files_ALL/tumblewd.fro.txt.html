It's been a long long time I've been smokin
Smokin marijuana
(La da da da da)
It takes out of my mental ghetto and places me in the bahamas
It's been a long long time I've been smoking
Smokin marijuana
(La da da da da)
It takes out of my mental ghetto and places me in the Bahamas
It puts my mind at ease
Indulgin myself in the calm breeze
And my problems will flow away beyond the palm trees

Chorus
*But I gotta keep smokin and a smokin and a smokin on
I keep chokin and a chokin and a chokin on
I keep sellin and a sellin and inhalin
My tumbleweed

I like to go to palmdale

Sit by the fountain
(sit by the fountain)
I light up a fat one gazin at the snow-capped mountains
(come again now uh)
I like to go to palmdale
Sit by the fountain
(sit by the fountain)
I light up a fat one gazin at the snow-capped mountains
Baby please don't nag
Go and get me the zig-zag
And my problems will float away
Like a plastic baiiiag

Chorus

I said Joey Jo has an afro
Sing something with soul chillin ice cold

Left palmdale but he still gettin paid
Hey man take me back to the bridge we up outta here man

It puts my mind at ease
Indulgin myself in the calm breeze
And my problems will flow away beyond the palm trees
Whatcha gotta do
