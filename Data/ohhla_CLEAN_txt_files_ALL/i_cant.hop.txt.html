Song:   I Can't Decide
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro/Chorus]
In the land of the killers
Better say your prayers tonight
Amen, its hard enough trynna survive
And to top it off I gotta watch my back
Cause these niggaz wanna act up
Should I fight or should I run?
Should I hide or get my gun?
I can't decide

[Hopsin]
Now see, Tyrone does whatever his homies do
Just the dope he's doin, deep in his mind he knows he's cool
He's ditchin class cause he feels like he don't belong in school
Momma always yellin out, "Damn Tyrone, what's wrong with you!"
He wanna show the world he grew in some balls
Abusin the law, eight weeks in juvenile hall
This dude is the cause of a lot of shit
Don't know where is father went
Never had no confidence, resortin to poppin clips
His homies thought that they were violent assassins
They said, come on tyrone, its time to get active
We gon roll up on this nigga
Real silent and passive
Then you pull out the 9 and then blast him
We gon roll to his crib
Be careful shootin so you don't hit the kids
You down fo' it?
Tyrone said, "You know what it is"
So they roll up, about to retaliate on this busta
"POP POP" (Bitch ass muthafucka)

[Chorus]
In the land of the killers
Better say your prayers tonight
Amen, its hard enough trynna survive
And to top it off I gotta watch my back
Cause these niggaz wanna act up
Should I fight or should I run?
Should I hide or get my gun?
I can't decide

[Hopsin]
Tyrones big ballin, gettin the dough
Fuck bitches and hoes, still rippin the 4's
Walk with his fist clinched he was itchin to blow
Shit, and all the local neighborhood niggaz would know
Its like he was born to fit the streets
Never had no chicken feet
Walked up to the local liquor store to get a swisher sweet
Before he walked in some dudes was like
"Aye nigga... POP POP POP, we don't play nigga"
They just shot him when his lives undone
The man inside the liquor store dialed 911
And at the same time he's strugglin tryin to find someone
Screamin "HELP HELP, STAY ALIVE YOUNG SON!"
The boys gunna die and he knows that
A bullet went through his skull cap
He's barely breathing
And both of his eyes balls have rolled back
Oh crap the people who witnessed it can't believe it yo
Maybe it's linked to the drive by he did a week ago

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]

Tyrone's dead, all over some dumb shit
His homies don't know who did it
They just got assumptions
Ready to whall out
With a sinister function
And drive by on some bitch niggaz and dump clips
And OG was like "fuck it he's dead now
So open up the 40 and take a sip and pour the rest out
Y'all got me stressed now
Shit yall need to chill out
Cause everytime some shit be poppin off yall pull the steel out"
One of the younger homies was like
"Fuck that, we gon' tug gats and bust back, trust that"
The O.G. was like "Man y'all don't need to be out here bustin slugs
Y'all don't even know who the fuck it was
Y'all fuckin bugs, y'all gonna be dead takin this violent route
You little niggaz always whilin out
You need to getcha shit straight and understand whatcha life about
Cause if a bullet hit your ass believe your lights is out"
The younger homey like "Nigga, you don't run these streets
You ain't never been no fuckin G
If I wanna bust my heat it's up to me
And I know them niggaz that killed T
Are the same niggaz that we hit up the other week"
Another homey like "Naaah they ain't get back for that
Cause that's them niggaz pullin up in the Cadilla- POP POP POP.... POP
