Typed by: donamini@excite.com

Well I shot some there, then I copped some beer
And did a show up in West Bubblefuck somewhere
Due to raps wider ratio, satellites to Nato
Hillbilly draws flew on the stage like tomatoes
Apparently more mack than I thought
Unfortunately wife piece back in New York
And I'm starvin
Being human and open with
A mad fine hillbilly woman was scoping Rick
Thought entered how to lean and bent it
Though I'm not gonna lie I was extremely tempted
(To what, Rick?) To discharge in a sista
Next thing in the dressing room, "Pardon me, mister"
Yes, I said cautiously
"Crazy, but possibly 
you could sign your name on the back of these Dazy Duke shorts for me"
Try to resist, now girlfriend startin' it
The pen won't write, "You can press down hard on it" -
Now my hand browsing her South end
Spun around about to shove my tongue in her mouth when
Rring! - Loosen the grip my hell had
My girl, she was talking so nice I felt bad
Being untrue, no telling what it might do to her
"I love you", forced to say I love you back too to her
Any thought of getting pussy was doomed to:"You got a wife?" 
Anniversary comin up soon too
Got off the phone, cock just got mute
Don't get me wrong it's not like you're not cute (Uh-huh)
I'm wrong for mistreating her, the wanting to skeeting her
"I understand, goodbye, it was real nice meetin' ya"
What an angel overcoming his wrongness
The moral I am trying to get across in this song is

If goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid (Say what?)
Goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid

Casually seating with some thick chords eating
With my album playing at a big board meeting
"I love this", being the coolest and the ruffest
A big willie woman pulls the Ruler in her office
And fixed a wedge in her garment, unsteady my heart went
'Cause her office looked like a three bedroom apartment -
Pounding was inevitable
She said to me "Rick, I think your album is incredible"
The way the hon' upon I, comin' on a sun I
"You're so darn sexy with that patch over your one eye"
Well I'm glad you think it's boomin' and I catch ya
Means a lot to me, coming from a woman of your stature
I mean, who could resist the Don head?
Start caressing Rick private, kiss me on the neck
And I can't be held accountable if down her gown I pull
Girlfriend pussy look plump and poundable
She sweats the set me emporer
Put one of your legs up on the desk and let me enter ya
Fantastic, though I start to act drastic
When I see my wedding band 'pon the bitch left ass cheek
Deep down, she felt that I tried to diss
I'm like, I can't do this as much as I'd like to miss
An angel overcoming his wrong, kids
The point that I am trying to get across in this song is

If goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keep no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid (Say what?)
Goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keep no secret, like who they creep with
Realise early it's a 2 way street, kid </pre>
