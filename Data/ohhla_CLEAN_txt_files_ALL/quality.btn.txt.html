From girlies now to havin niggaz on my dick

Call me at night and I'll be fuckin your bitch (haha)
You know it I won't switch
Aiyyo Rob, what's up with Pete?

Yeah, as we continue, with the freestyle, kinda like this
Ya step up, motherfuckers need to get dissed
Step back, and don't fuck around with the track
The Beatnuts is fat, and yes we all that
Big Kahuna, cockin from the bush
Fuck around, and get pushed off the cliff (yeah)
