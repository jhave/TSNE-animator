[Mr. Serv-On x4]
Daddy was a gangsta who raised me
Momma was a lady who raised me

Forever, a true thing forever, kissing dead triggers
Born to die quicker see me pull my nine ticker
Remember me, now tell me what you sell me
I pistol diaper running wild a ghetto child
With aim, to slang weed and cane
Never knew my place in life until daddy put me in the game
He said, son make our name famous
Can't let these bitches bang with us
Let alone find the love to die with us
With tears in her eyes and god on her side
Momma said a prayer for us
She saw the turn I took, but none shook
To look a murder in my eyes find a ten for my first ride
The same day my daddy died
Now I'm in the hole for shanking, thinking suicide
Until a voice from the grave said son, you gots to ride
Stand tall and when they let you free fuck a bitch for me

Daddy was a gangsta momma was a lady who raised me
Thuggin got your baby
Daddy was a gangsta momma was a lady who raised me
Murder got your baby
Daddy was a gangsta momma was a lady who raised me
Dope slanging got your baby
Daddy was a gangsta momma was a lady who raised me
Armed robbery

[Fiend]
Momma look at your baby boy, josing No Limit lookin
Surrounded by killers and dealers, sharing a little boasting
No one approaching, it's survival cause you heard us a rival
Street, probably murder one hand, look the man for the dollar
Couldn't holler, wanted power
Fiend working dirt like a trucker, bad motherfucker
No living this, get back to my mother
Moving hubbers cause I'm a surburban lover
That's on my stash, put it on my best peice of ass
forever have cash
Lord help me surpass the low of dirt and grimy
Please remind me
it's all mental when the killers if they find me
Will never counted for dangerous for strangers
with no questions
Let my anger drop a nigga for playing, thats more lessons
Stepping high, still got my pride, brother done died
I pull a minute then get back in it
cause I dont let shit slide
Even though my momma cried when my better half got killed
Cause in me she got a fortress being built

[Mr. Serv-On]
Daddy was a gangsta momma was a lady who raised me
Gang banging got your baby
Daddy was a gangsta momma was a lady who raised me
Manslaughter got your baby
Daddy was a gangsta momma was a lady who raised me
Rape got your baby
Daddy was a gangsta momma was a lady who raised me
Car jacking

Bitches forgive me not, I die for my block
Represent my block, I can't stop
Set tripping gang signs
blood and crippin (blood and crippin)
All day, sit with tears holding, familia
for years
Momma, feel my release am I your baby
Fifty pounds big, time got me crazy
Daily shake for punks with no game
The level niggas yell my name
Steady slang, don't let em see ya
Vazquez from south Florida dropping these bricks
For naked flips, no more handle this
She got two kids, I'm an uncle
Niggas used to fight now they bang that's why I live
Give my family addicted prayers, childhood homies gotta stare
Hoes know I'm back jailhouse love cheddar
From front to back slack with my
loot I might shake before I shoot
World, sacrafice my gangsta son, daddy's gone now
I'm bout a none
So to some, I gotta hold my fuckin arm too
So in this world if they see me, I hit a stone
Then let me die, love dead and gone

Yeah, this goes out to all them niggas locked down.
Magnolia Slim!
Keep your motherfucking head up.
It don't matter.
You either gonna see that other side or you gonna see freedom.
My nigga L off the parkway, my nigga D.
Worldwide.

Daddy was a gangsta
Momma was a lady who raised me
Daddy was a gangsta who raised me
Momma was a lady who raised me
Daddy was a gangsta who raised me
Momma was a lady who raised me
Daddy was a gangsta who raised me
Momma was a lady who raised me

Who raised me, who raised me, who raised me.
This fucked up society, that's why.
For momma, keep your head up.
Daddy, look down.  Cause your little nigga coming up.
That's who raised me motherfucker.
No Limit for life nigga.
Mr. S-E-R-V to you motherfuckers.
Peace.</pre>
