Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I can't get no sleep I've got these money habits
Every time I see some money you know I've gotta grab it
Dopeboy I do magic with saran wrapper, Done seen more bricks than a contracter
And you can bring it back if you done bust a rapper
My daughter 4 months, bricks in a pamper
I'm a role master, I love Tampa
You say you from the streets than I gotta stamp ya
Grant Jackson, Ben Franklin
If money through with you then you ain't gonna make it
The streets will give it to you and the streets will take it
Every nigga in the streets got no patience

[Chorus]
I got money habits, I got money habits
Every time I see some money yeah I gotta grab it
I got money habits, I got money habits
Daydreamer seeing money, talking been franklin
I got money habits, I got money habits
Every time I see some money yeah I gotta grab it
I got money habits, I got money habits
Daydreamer seeing money, talking been franklin

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I go loko about that guapo, off El Chapo with the choppa
Like a rasta I will've shot ya, blocka blocka Waka Flocka!
I got young niggas in the hood that'll kill your ass for 50 dollars
Holler bedrock if you scared, nigga I ain't never hollered!
Don't be bothered I strapped the C4 right to you father
Pipe Bomb taped to a toddler
No I'm not an infant but I got a bunch of baby bottles
For instance, I back doored a nigga in The Ramada
The distance from Florida to Georgia is farther
My amigos is still sending bales across the border
Off the boat bitch I swear she look like she came out the water
It's BrickSquad 1017 and ain't no niggas harder!

[Chorus]
I got money habits, I got money habits
Every time I see some money yeah I gotta grab it
I got money habits, I got money habits
Daydreamer seeing money, talking been franklin
I got money habits, I got money habits
Every time I see some money yeah I gotta grab it
I got money habits, I got money habits
Daydreamer seeing money, talking been franklin</pre>
