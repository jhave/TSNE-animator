(stay with me, stay with me)
yo, it's like I cut myself open to see just how I felt
Dad steppin' out of our place when I was twelve
Bad situation plus my mother's bad health
Got me starin' in the mirror like "Damn, no chance of wealth"
Same tired story, now the story tells itself
Thirteen years old saying fuck it go for delf
Get my mind straight feel vexed need to vent
Know I'm too young to be stressin' bout the rent
Sick to my stomach
Hartimes comin' in
No help from no one
Skin start bubblin'
Anger start doublin'
Attitude cagey
Boxed in tensed up stressed out crazy
Sun mixed with clouds turn my atmosphere shady
One way or another I got no time for maybe
Strange how this music affected me
Knew from the first time I wrote that this life was my destiny
That's my destiny..

Run-D.M.C., KRS, Public Enemy
Rakim, Kane, Slick Rick what it meant to me
Road to the riches, c'mon kid stay step with me
I could go for days and those days were the best for me
Couple years later hit the game with intensity
Somethin' wasn't right had to change up the recipe
Got my first taste all the lies and discrepancies
So-called industry snakes, slugs, centipedes
Whole lot of broken promises lay next to me
Whole lot of broken shattered dreams stay next to me
Nine or ten contracts, four groups later
Couple hundred joints got lost up in the tape deck
Selfed out in hatred, got me feelin' worthless
Things ain't lookin' right and got me feelin' nervous
Sacrificed for years, barely scratched the surface
Comin' out my pocket like "Damn, this shit ain't worth it"
Cultivate a new plan, small funds to work with
Built Crisis Center and we dropped it on them PERFECT!
All around the world seem every kid that heard it
Started checkin' for us and it buzzed throughout the circuit
Beats, rhymes and cuts kid that's how we word it
Beats, rhymes and cuts kid that's how we murdered
Spit on any track and just watch the two convert it
Back to real hip hop 'cause that's the only purpose

It's Beautiful Music designed to touch your soul
Every day struggle plus life treats you cold
Make it to the night take a look at how we've grown
It ain't done yet, next step: Lock 'n Load!

It's Beautiful Music designed to touch your soul
Every day struggle plus life treats you cold
Make it to the night take a look at how we've grown
It ain't done yet, last step: Lock 'n Load! (lock 'n load)
It's Beautiful (repeating and echoing out)</pre>
