Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ridin with the stick, puffin on the purp
Overtime on you niggas, goin to work
I'm goin to work, I'm goin to work
Overtime on you niggas, cause I'm goin to work
I'm goine get it any means necessary
Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secratary
I'm goin to work [x4]

Gotta go to court tomorrow, D.A. on my dick
So I'm a wear my automar, just to make em sick
I might go yellow presi on em, just to make em pissed
Then go home and break a brick and break it down to bacon bits
I'm goin to work, I'm goin to work
The phones poppin, like we on the 1st
We up in neimans, we goin bizerk
A nigga cross me, he goin to church
Ridin through the hood, back of the back
Started in the front, now they in back of the a back
No love for the haters, no rap for the rats
Velcro shawty, we strapper then strapped
Half you niggas tellin so we never sellin work
They don't wanna come and get it then we mail em work
Put my money in it so you now it better work
And my shooters with me and you know they put in work

Ridin with the stick, puffin on the purp
Overtime on you niggas, goin to work
I'm goin to work, I'm goin to work
Overtime on you niggas, cause I'm goin to work
I'm goine get it any means necessary
Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secratary
I'm goin to work [x4]

I might go buy a boat tomorrow, just to take a trip
Big belly rude boy, bad jamaican bitch
Or head straight to Columbia, I'm talkin bulgatar
Ship em up to Philly, milli living like he gorbetroph
Not the regan era but a nigga makin cheddar
Gray philemon in the mirror and I'm never tellin
The game sweet so the seats watermelon
Clip full of sunflower seeds in my mac 11
And I steal a motherfucker like a student felon
Bookbags full of blocks and them bitches sellin
I'm goin to work [x4]

Ridin with the stick, puffin on the purp
Overtime on you niggas, goin to work
I'm goin to work, I'm goin to work
Overtime on you niggas, cause I'm goin to work
I'm goine get it any means necessary
Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secratary
I'm goin to work [x4]

Got some youngins that will murder for a new bike
Have you lookin like you fresh up out a food fight
Spaghetti on yo head
Shirt ketchup red
Shootin banana clips, we ain't never scared
Niggas say they lookin for me they ain't never there
I'm like a Metro phone store cause I'm everywhere
I'm gone get it any means necessary
Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secretary
Gave my nigga 50 years forever barry
He say he gone make it home like he never worried
Free da homie rick, and free my homie brick
Doin hard time, love of the 36
Tried to get her number shawty she ain't know me then
Wanna fuck me now, I'm like you dirty bitch
Rookie of the year, cause I murder shit
And I'm way back
Cause I'm maybach

Ridin with the stick, puffin on the purp
Overtime on you niggas, goin to work
I'm goin to work, I'm goin to work
Overtime on you niggas, cause I'm goin to work
I'm goine get it any means necessary
Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secratary
I'm goin to work [x4]</pre>
