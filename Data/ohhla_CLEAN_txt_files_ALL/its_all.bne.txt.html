It's all Mo Thug, It's all Mo, Mo Thug (2x)

(Lazy)
Oh well, if ya snooze ya loose
Stop bringin that pistol and fetch ya,
Shoot it and catch ya, shit, pap,
Stay packin that gat in yo lap away
So if ya can't roll strapped
Now how about that
Dat pistol go tap at niggas who
Go fuckin wit one of my own
No no, wrong, Any place where my chrome
Left devils at they home
Double bang, execution, we mo murda, stupid trick
You bitch that asked me
We don't play wit me game that be remainin mine and little man ran
To disater, wish I asked him
And I popped up and capped him
And Eazy is where we began
But I blessed him in the master plan
Niggaz thugin off in the Claire
It's still the pen
Can't fuck wit these Cleveland Claire playas
So as long as ya betta be workin
Cause the Bone and Mo Thug on this mission
Listen, betta pray everyday
Cross us on the way hoe

(Krayzie)
Ohhhh, oh, oh
I just wanna seperate from the presious, baby
Or maybe,
I was meant to live my life caught up in this world of games
And God's name I pray
The devil, he be bringin me down
I can feel him cause he pullin me now,
Iv'e been blessed wit an incredable style
When there's pushin, it's just try to seperate and to break this all down,
Now ain't that foul,
So I asked the Lord to help me
"Lord, why does this life overwhealm me?"
When we livin in hell,
But we chill most every day like we in heaven
Oh well,
But time will tell,
Singin, "This is for the ringin of the bell, the bell, the bell."
But it be hard to maintain and stay peacefull
If you don't know to tame the devil then the devil will beat you,
Defeat you, deceive you, evil,
He will never leave you alone
I've been lookin for a better day,
But they don't ever seem to want to come my way (my way)
Hey, I've had a hell of a time
Tryin to make it cause my people steady stressin my mind,
So I stay high
So I'm already sittin on the top, ya see me,
When he be wit me,
He's daily inovatin me
Rarely see ya on the daily mission
Keep your distance from the flames,
Maybe you can survive, forever and a day

(Flesh)
Hell yeah
Got me flippin in the North Coast
Remeber me,
The crook who wrote the book,
I'm off da hook,
Most of yall niggaz betta take another look
Cause if ya playa hate the Bone then yo life'll get took
So quit, never bringin ya no bullshit man,
Face to face it's that assassin gang
Bringin the heat, all yall niggas bringin is lame,
But if ya wanna bring the pain, then ya gotta maintain
Commin in on another level,
Imma put you on deck up at the top of the pile
Fake niggas wanna claim my style but Imma break em on down,
But you gotta come unique,
It's the thuggish ruggish sound
That you're lookin for, or searchin for
Everybody boy wanna be like Bone and stay high,
Little kids no longer wanna be like Mike,
That's right they tryin to be like Bone and keep thuggin fo life
Gettin ready for the end, dawg
Wit my nigga Ken Dawg, hustlas, shiftas and Tre,
II Tru, AJ
Same muthafuckas from around my way

(Krayzie, Lazy)
This is how we play,
Every day it's the same old same,
Around my way (around my way)
We be thuggin a-round my way
This is how we play,
Every day it's the same old same,
Around my way,
Around my way,
Around my way,
Come around my way, my way (my way)

It's all Mo Thug, It's all Mo, Mo Thug (2x)

(Bizzy)
Little nigga wanna come, gunna feel my pain, pain
On the brain it's a stress, a strain
The game, the fame, the fame, the fame, (fame)
What about those hoes, oh no
Little Easy fo sho to teach Bone,
And if he's wrong, well, he's gone
For my journey to keep me strong
But dear Lord I miss my peoples
And it just seems so evil,
And that I can't kiss my kids goodnight,
Put em to bed, tuck em tight
And catch some sleep and that's all right, that's all right,
I'll get mine, yeah I'll get mine
It'll take time, minimum crime,
Weed and wine'll be just fine
Got somethin buggin all of my peoples (what)
In the back of a Caddy
Juppin outta Caddies, spreadin through alleys
In Cleveland and Cali like daddy and,
Oh, no, love, for double-a and duble-a zero,
Really wanna get yo combo,
Said I'm riddin round in your boat

(Wish)
You niggas can't fuck, with
These Claire players, on top of the pile
And we roll this
Stand back, hatas gonna be here for a while,
Can't ya hear the crowd screamin real loud?
And that's for Bone Thugs
Dear Lord, my sis has got Bone to look up to
And feel proud of, on top of all of that there
Mommy's out the ghetto now
I thank the Lord and thee, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony,
For everything it brangs to me, yeah
I thank the Lord and thee, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony,
For everything it brangs to me
Better believe that we'll do em, do em,
Shoot em, shoot em
Kill em, kill em
Nigga ain't gonna stop nothin, niggaz
Been a long, hard way
Been a long, long, long, hard way
And I gotta get mine
Gonna floss up in the bed
Watchin niggas watchin me
That's tryin to take mine
But I got somethin for em, watchin niggas
Runnin away from me
It's time, bye, bye
Nigga don't wind up playa hatin
We got much love in Mo Thug
It's all about Mo Thug

It's all Mo Thug, It's all Mo, Mo Thug (4x)</pre>
