[Chorus]
Been running for too long [x3] It's time to give me mine
Time to time to give me mine, time to give me mine
Benn running for too long, it's time to give me mine

[Lil Wayne]
I'm so far ahead man
What they talking bout, Fee, they ain't saying shit
It could weak a whole court, like Stan Smith
Or Judge Judy, you niggas betta shoot me
Cause I bought my mans a glock, and I bought myself a uzi
Don't confuse me, no they don't amuse me
I come after the money, like Wednesday come after Tuesday
I told Stunna I'm wylin', he say don't worry I got ya
He told me, cut the heads off, and bring 'em back for papa
Yea, dem niggas gettin scurred, word
All dat talkin, just a whole bunch of verb
Pussy ass nigga got a whole bunch of nerve
I have 'em put yo picture on a whole bunch of shirts
I smoke a lot of weed, and drink a whole bunch of syrup
I like brain, so I fucks with a whole bunch of nerds
Heh, I am number 1
Cause 2 is not a winner, and no one remembers third

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Wizzle F. Baby, yea (bitch!)
See, money is the topic, baby
See, I'm a giant, all these otha niggas mockin, baby
They microscopic, baby
Big crib, I can't even hear 'em knockin, baby
Headed to the top, like I'm tied to a rocket, baby
To all the foreign woman, let's make a tropic, baby
I got so many bitches, I could make a combilation
I'd like to thank the haters, for yo cooperation
I got dat docter chopper, give you an operation
Nigga this is my crusaders, kill for confromation
We all got on masks, we bout to toxic waste 'em
I hope they momma raised 'em, cause they got bitch ways
If they don't pay for ya, they get ya back dead
Real talk, stop walkin on ya back legs
Step into the lime light, bullshit backstage
I used to tote a 32 up in my crack days
I tote dat AK-47 in my rap days

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
I'm comin, Wizzle F. Baby (bitch!), yeah
Come and get it, anyone can get it
But since I'm the president, I'll be a lil more politic
I'm chillin in the clinic
Cause dats how many nurses, I got working on my dizzick
Snakes in the grass, rats, lizards
But 'round here, snitches don't exist like wizards
Hoe this ain't punch, I'm sippin on some sizzurp
I roll a fat joint, and do my fingers like scissors
Da game so cold, I done had my share of blizzards
But now I got dat big money runnin like rivers, nigga
I'm hear to get my shit straight, burner on the hip waist
Leave a nigga street full of bones, like a fish plate
Yea, I'm from the hood, but now I'm livin in a rich way
Swear I got on my knees, and thanked God for this day
So say what you wanna say
I need to throw a cup of water in my face
1st place, I...
