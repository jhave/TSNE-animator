[Intro: Lil B]
If I learn one thing in this life
A lot of people walk around blind and
Not even reading a book
Letting alone picking it up
This basedgod velli
Gonna change niggas lives
Change the world
It's Lil B
Rawest raper ever
Rawest rapper alive

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Niggas talking about Lil B done killed rap
Stupid bitch man I brought the rap game back
It ain't hard to be a thug and go sell crack
Much harder to have a smile I chose rap
It ain't hard to smoke weed, and go tote gats
It ain't hard to pimp hoes, man your lame for that
It ain't hard to rob a nigga at close range
Much harder to go outside and use your brain
Much harder to go to college and go get grades
Much harder to get a job to go feed your seed
Real easy to give up and go complain
Real easy to get a strike and go to jail again
Real thugs is the one to not kill niggas
Real thugs is the one that go help niggas
Real thugs is that one that cry for your niggas
Real thugs be the one that ride for your niggas

[Chorus: Lil B]
Choose your life [x3]
Its Lil B

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I can tell you the most rappers lying to you
They dont care about you they just want that check
Why I rap? cause I do that shit for respect
Why I rap? cause I want to bring people peace
I done almost lost my life in the fucking streets
Thats why man I never glorify the beef
Most rap niggas face never face 30
Came home bounce back no hate involed
Man I swear thats why I call myself based god
Man I swear if I make it man I pray to god
Cause I know a lot of people want to be involve
And I know a lot of people want to see me fall
But I never give up thats word to mom [x2]
