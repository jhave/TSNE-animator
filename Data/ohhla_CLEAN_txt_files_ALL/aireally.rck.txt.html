[Rick Ross]
Everytime I call she just come
'Cause everytime I call, she get to cum
Damn, I'm a lover yet look what this chick done
When I used to keep a roll of them bitches like "Which one?"
...It's the BAWSE
(Radio Killaaaaaa...)
It's not a dream, baby...
(Radio Killa, killa) ...or is it a dream?

She graduated from the school of arts
Now she swimmin in the pool of sharks
Roughest niggaz with the coolest cars
Sophomore year, had her first menage
Better D.C. like "Go Barack!"
Girl drunk it like a Fiji and she blowed my socks
Every night, she comin through for me to fuck that
Found out she had a man, I holla fuck that
Better give that boy a bus pass
I see no competition, baby girl a must-have
My letters hinted on my mustache
But maybe not, but then again it made her butt fast
Good dick make a chick wanna cut class
The way I'm knockin at the door, they call it trespass
She my dime, not the one I wanna cuss at
Lookin fine, real diamonds on the cutglass

[Chorus: The-Dream]
People call you blind...(People call you blind...)
Oh, but all you need is me, girl (All you need is me, girl)
You're all that's in my mind (Ooh, yeaaaaah...)
All you need is me, girrrrrrl
Uh, and all I want is you
All a nigga really want is you, all a nigga really want is you
All a nigga really want is you, all a nigga really want is you (All I want is you)
All a nigga really want is you, all a nigga really want is you
All a nigga really want is you, all a nigga really want is you
(All I want is you)

[Rick Ross]
Who can hit it mo' faster?
I'm talkin authentic orgasms
Film that, play it on the big plasma
Back to work, just a lil' bit faster
She say life is a journey
I need mine, just like my attorney
I get sued like a nigga switch shoes
Long money but he got a quick fuse
Ride slow, but I'm in a quick car
Pause for a minute, paint 'em in a pict-ure
Baby girl, my money good
Who turned her on to Nicolas Kirkwood
Time to give that boy a bus pass
I see no competition, baby girl a must-have
She shines like a diamond..
Motivation for my rhymin

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Suede pea coat with the Gucci trim
Knew it was him by the Gucci brim
We gotta do it B-I-G
I'm tryna hit lottery in the V.I.P.
Green leaves in my shot glass
All night, soul team, a Ciroc ad
Ain't nothin you can tell me
I'm on the hills/heels like I'm Jonathan Kelsey
Told her friends that she felt me
We made love through the "Love/Hate" LP
She my Josephine Baker
May need morphine, the deeper that I take her
...I'm a back breaker
Another text bracket, Benz Maybach-er
Green Bay Packa
My life a movie so tonight that's where to jack 'er

[Chorus]</pre>
