[Cormega]
Spank, what'chu doing? I know you up there
In heaven with a pretty angel braidin' ya hair
Eatin ya sunflower seeds drinkin ya beer
All I could do is wish you was here, in the physical
Super hit me on the two way and left me a message sayin
You mighta got killed, it couldn't be real
Then reality struck me, nah, that shit crushed me
Your life ended, you cheated me outta a friendship
Plus we wasn't speakin as frequent
I was O.T., you was in Queensbridge
Son you know me, it wasn't no secret
I wasn't agreeing with niggas motives, shit is corrosive
Like rust, who can I trust when niggas is cobras?
Yo I spoke at ya funeral, your aunt sang beautiful
Ya moms so proud the way the crew came through for you
Word son, the love is real

Chorus [Cormega]
Did you ever lose a nigga you love?
Then ask yourself is there a heaven for thugs?
And will you be forgiven when your spirit is judged
This song is dedicated to my niggas above
Did you ever lose a nigga you love?
Then ask yourself is there a heaven for thugs?
And will you be forgiven when your spirit is judged
This song is dedicated to my niggas above

[Cormega]
Blue, I think of you and the tears begin
I know you my dog, thats a man best friend
My life ain't the same since you met ya end
So for you I represent my nigga
When I come to Greensborough I think of you
Sittin on twenties, sippin on remy
If you looked in dudes eyes then you woulda saw envy
And maybe you'd still be alive, you hear me son?
I mean ya daughter was barely one
Too young to understand she'll never see you again
Little Ariel at daddy burial
Unaware of how much daddy cared for you
And I don't gotta talk about the things I'll do
Son I got'chu, be easy
Ya little girl will never need and never see the treachery this world has to
offer
Yes believe my nigga, uhh

Chorus

[Cormega]
Mommy, I need you to guide me
And help me find a judist among me
I know truely you love me
I battled no power but the ruler above me
And prayed for my enemies aswell as my friends
Will I ever see you again?
Ma, you was so pretty
I'd give anything to have you near me
Life is precious like a diamond necklace
I need you, to point me in the right direction
I'm still learnin lifes lessons, ya my inner essence
I'm your reflection as you seen in my conception
Through-out my adolesence I was missin you, wishin you
would appear in the physical, but you never came
Rappers feel they my eqaul, but can't measure my pain
That run through me like blood in my veins
My life could be a movie,
Who I'm I? a real thug yours truely
'Mega, 'Mega, for all my fallen...
