[Intro]
Put your stunna frames on, whoa
Put your stunna-put your stunna-put your stunna frames on
Put your stunna shades on, put your stunna shades on
I-I-I wear my stunnglasses at night

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Put your stunna frames on, whoa
Put your stunna-put your stunna-put your stunna frames on
Put your stunna shades on, put your stunna shades on
I-I-I wear my stunnglasses at night

[Kia Shine]
Put your stunna frames on, so you can see what I'm sayin
I got that ice on my teeth, you can see what I'm sayin
I'm sayin - kinfolk, they call me Kinfolk Jones
I feel so fly up in my frames, I done came up with a song
I got them D.G., Louis V, Armani and the Gucci jones
Oh forgot the sticker on yo' lens? Naw, that's a super stone
Kinfolk, kinfolk, you know the Memphis boys crazy
(Why you wearin shades at night~?) Respect my fresh and stop hatin

[Chorus]

[Kia Shine]
Check it, Polo horses on my shirt, Chanel's on my face
Red monkeys on my ass, on my feet Bathing Apes
Bathing Apes? Ay, y'all gon' respect my fresh
I'm a fly Memphis hustler, you shouldn't expect nuttin less
See my shirt match my car match my shoes match my lens
Damn kinfolk! You done merked them folks again
Again when it come to clothes mayne I be killin it
Trill talk, my frame game is ridiculous

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Now do the motorcycle (AY!) do the motorcycle (AY!)
Put your stunna shades on and do the motorcycle (AY!)
And if you cain't dance (AY!) then do your two step (AY!)
If you cain't dance (AY!) then do your two step (AY!)

[Jack Frost]
I'm gettin money, I'm gettin paid
When you see your boy Frost I got them frames on my face
Cause my future so bright I got to wear shades
And my eyes prolly red from the kush and the haze
I get buck with my shades on # buck with my shades on
Walk like a pimp and grab my nuts with my shades on
Cartier, Valentino, even B&amp;G's
When it come to stunna shades niggaz ain't seein me

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Outro: repeat 2X]
Now do the Memphis walk (AY!) do the Memphis walk (AY!)
Put your stunna shades on and do the Memphis walk (AY!)
And if you cain't dance (AY!) then do your two step (AY!)
If you cain't dance (AY!) then do your two step (AY!)</pre>
