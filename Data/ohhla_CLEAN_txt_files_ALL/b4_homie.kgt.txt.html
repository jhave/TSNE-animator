Yo nigga, let's go scoop up some of these hoes at the 'Paradise', man
Hey man, ah - I'm engaged now, man
What?
I'm engaged
To that bitch?
Aw man, don't be talkin about my woman like that
Oh, now you're gon' trip on me
Wait, wait, hold up, hold up

[ VERSE 1: King Tee ]
How you gon' go and put a hoe before me?
When I'm the one that helped your broke ass on the streets
'Damn, I'm starvin, what you got to eat?
I'm short, I need a place to sleep'
Oh, but amnesia, that damn skeezer
Made you forget who was down witcha
I thought birds of a feather flock together
And don't a damn thing change but the weather
But now I know the real, I guess I had it all wrong
We used to hit the Ides until the shit was all gone
Where was she when you needed niggas off your ass
And who'd you come to get to go blast?
Not that once-a-month-bleedin, always on her knees
Suckin every Tom, Dick and Harry like a berry
I seen her with a trick at the Motel 6
And you still tryin to get that bitch Afro Fix
She got you by the nuts, playin with your wiener
Wrapped around her finger when the last time you seen her
Well, when you do, bust her lip
And if you don't, you'se a bitch
So sit down when you piss, muthafucka

(It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me)  --&gt; Deadly Threat

[ VERSE 2: Deadly Threat ]
The bitch got you gone, talkin on a phone
Tellin muthafuckas when you see me, it's on
But little do he know that she a zero
And I'm still her favorite superhero
See, I got the 411 on a hoe
Just like I was tellin you before
You're just a piece of the mission
Guess where her lips been?
I told you don't be kissin, but you don't listen
[ King Tee ]
Yeah, Jaws (Jaws) Jaws the only hoe I ever saw
That could suck a basketball through a straw
She don't like niggas with Nissan trucks
Unless they got the monster bumps
[ Deadly Threat]
That's right, honey, bunny's money-hungry
And she'll frame ya, she's out to getcha
Get the picture, cause the bitch'll
Take you for a long-ass ride like the hitcher
So don't be surprised if they find you in a ditch
With your guts hangin out lookin like Top Ramen
And when I see the bitch, I'm bombin
Cause she's a false tenderony, plus tossed balony
And she ain't your home, she's a hoe
Don't put a hoe before the homie

(Hey yo bitch, you better tell em)  --&gt; Ice Cube

[ VERSE 3: Ice Cube ]
Who's wearin the pants, who's wearin the pants, nigga?
If you ask me, I think that her dick is bigger
Than your little dick, and I'm tellin you, Jay
The bitch got you locked down like Pelican's Bay
Now I told you if you fuck with the hoe
She's guaranteed to have you trippin
And me and you set-trippin
I told my muthafuckin crew
To kidnap the hoe, and they came back with you
[ King Tee ]
I can't fade a nigga that's bitch-made
Kool-Aid pumpin, tell a bitch somethin
She'll have your ass cookin dinner
While she's lettin every nigga in her hood run up in her
[ Ice Cube ]
Got you runnin like Bruce Ginner, and the hoe be
Pussy-whippin your ass like Toby
Now you act like you don't know me
Only a mark'll put a hoe before the homies

Word - this muthafucka is different
Yeah
Tell me your secret
Not just any secret
Just answer one question for me, baby
Do you love me?
I love you
Very, very, very, very much
Baby
Can I come pick you up and take you shoppin?
Spend all my money...
I love you
I love you

Don't put a hoe before the homie</pre>
