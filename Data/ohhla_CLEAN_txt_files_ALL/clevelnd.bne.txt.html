Cleveland is the city- City that we come from

[Verse 1: Krayzie]
Nigga wuz born and brought up in Cleveland
Cool quiet just like my daddy
When I wuz thuggin out in the alley
With my boys in a stolen Caddie
I wuz shootin the pree blowin some weed
And every now and then I sip some Hennesey
And after my niggas wuz bustin we probably wuz lookin for trouble
Uh Oh here come the po po
Yall better toss that llello quick and tuck ya bankroll
Don't think I forgot where I come from dog cuz I know
Cleveland Ohio fo sho where we slang dope in the slo

[Verse 2: Wish]
I'm from the streets the streets of Cleveland
Its manditory you need it cuz niggas'll catch ya slippin
and niggas'll leave ya bleedin
Fuck what they said about Bone catch us anywhere
Grab a couple of my St. Claire niggas take us anywhere
We don't care
Handle that and take care of that
If it goes like that then it goes like that
It's Cleveland [Cleveland]
Its manditory to leave these niggas bleedin [bleedin]
And you could neva hate against Bone you wrong
U know we brung it on so strong

[Verse 3: Layzie]
We get em, split em, we hit em
And Bone been the shit since I could remember
Befo most of these niggas even thought about rap
We wuz screamin out no surrender
With a gat in the hand runnin wild in the land
With a pocket full of boulders
Po po know they can't hold us
When they east dog comin from the shoulders
And the older niggas they told us
U gotta get down fo yo hustle
Got glocks to show you this muscle
Get the money little nigga don't struggle
That's no bitch nigga that's the rules
All my Cleveland niggas said to me
They're the ones that gave this game to me
Ima push this shed to the head ya see

[Verse 4: Bizzy]
Ya better believe Syann I be scared when I wuz there
Nigga you know I ain't goin nowhere
Your mother wuz my mother
Ya brotha wuz right here
In the Columbus but they loved me not
When I went to Cleveland they said where you been
When I'm unconditional with my loving
And at the C-L-E-V-E...L-A-N-D
And we get bucked on the block block block block
And nigga remember I said weee this for we
And all them niggas that love down in Columbus nigga Cleveland Rocks
