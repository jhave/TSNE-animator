[Jadakiss]
Uhh, used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed RYDE OR DIE, I thought you would die wit me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit me
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit me
Used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed RYDE OR DIE, I thought you would die wit me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit me
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit me

[DMX]
When it rain, niggaz get wet, so stay dry (uh)
Don't cross me, I compete to snake eye (woo)
You just lost me, like yo' shadow in the dark (uh-huh)
Fucked around and forced me to hit the shadow with the spark (UHH)
Blew your shit apart -- now it's two halves of one nigga
"Look at him," I said after a few laughs, "Dumb nigga!
Stupid is as stupid does -- cocksucker (WHAT?)
And look what being stupid does, get you shot sucker (WHAT?)
I let you get too close and you bit me (uh)
I told you nah for too long, you tried to hit me
Thought you was wit me (uhh)
Well you might as well forget me, cause from this point on (uh-huh)
it's war, it won't stop until one of us is gone" (c'mon!)
I'm still mad at myself for lettin that shit go down (UHH)
Somebody shoulda told me, I was fuckin wit a clown (aight?)
And I think they found and let.. you.. nigga.. drown
.. you know how shit get around

Chorus: Jadakiss (repeat 2X)

Used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed RYDE OR DIE, I thought you would die wit me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit me
	(Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit me
	(Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

[Styles]
Aiyyo X fuck them niggaz, them niggaz ain't your dogs
Better treat like some cats and shake they ass to the floor
Been seen the foul shit, put the guns in em
Lil' wannabe you's, so why you run wit em?
You can't trust niggaz no further than you can throw em
You don't wanna murder the niggaz, then you blow em
He usin yo' style, that make him yo' child 
Then he shouldn't make a move til he hear it from yo' mouth
We don't allow snakes - runnin wit dogs 
Tell them ain't nuttin like a funeral that's gonna be yours
Double-R, and I ain't here to start trouble God 
But if they wasn't your niggaz I woulda BEEN hit em hard
Niggaz look like they phony (what) sound like they phony (huh?)
Run around actin like motherfucker's homies
We all make mistakes, that's part of the breaks 
But you can still call the apes, we bringin the duct tape
and the broomstick -- them bitch-ass niggaz is gettin raped
Know how we ride, whoever on they side can die
And we ain't tryin to be blind, fuck eye for eye
Cause we only takin yours, you know the doggs you motherfucker

Chorus

[DMX]
There was always somethin there, but I just couldn't touch it (uh-huh)
Wasn't somethin that would hurt me, so a nigga said, "Fuck it!" (uhh)
I let it slide, laughed and joked let it ride (true)
Now that you done killed it, Im glad that it died (AIGHT?)
It's aight, I know where you live, I'm just waitin (uhh)
til we knock on your front door, and let you meet Satan (c'mon!)
That's what you get for hatin -- FUCK YOU FAGGOT! (WHAT?)
I never did trust you faggot -- I'll bust you faggot! (WHAT?)
What you done forgot about the streets is this: (uhh)
You do a drimy nigga like you do a grimy bitch (AIGHT?)
You just STOP fuckin wit him, you got no more rap (uh)
No more, "Yo whassup D?"  No more dap (uhh)
Be lucky if I don't spit in your face, off of G.P. (WHAT?)
AND WHAT?  Bitch-ass nigga, you can't beat me (woo)
Don't take it as a loss, just take it as a lesson
Next time think twice, or get iced wit the Wessun
NIGGA! (Nigga!)

Chorus

[Jadakiss]
