(Infamous it don't stop)
hmmm....nah hmmm hmm
(Yeh yeh Infamous knock em out the box)
(yo yo yo)
oh oh oh oh
(I got you stuck off the realness)
hmm hm hm 
(Infamous knock em out the box)
uhoh ohhh....
(I got you stuck off the realness)
yeh...ooh

It wasn't raining yet
But it was definately
A little misty on
That warm November night
And my heart was pounding
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face
To feel alive
And then you casually walked into the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desire for you
(And I was twisted)
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you
To taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

And so we finished the Moet and
Started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
In your arms
(you took me in your arms)
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
(So I....)
Threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long time
(And I was lifted)
And for a while I forgot
The sorrow and pain
And melted with you as we stood
There in the rain

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night (Repeat again)

Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words I love you
And touched you so very
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye

RAP (Mobb Deep):
(Infamous rocks the box)
I got you stuck off the realness
Feel this pourin down on your buildings
The rain about to fall us
Score up in the project call 
Third floor gravitates 
On the staircase
As we embrace strictly loud without the raw base
Me and my ol' dog blowin
Out the smokes fog
But over all you the one that's like my pistol
I said crystal
Keep you on my side
Til the ficial (yo yo yo yo)
Ain't it ill how we click boo
Just me and you
Got me stuck off the realness
Just me and you
Up on the roof beats
Peable beach
Talk to me anytime
Even when i wit my peeps
Ruler L why you smell like the perfume Channel
Push big G's 
Rappin all is simply heavy
We can do it on a roof top
Do it til we both drop M-O-B-B 
With Mariah sounds so hot

Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
(Envision you caressing me)
And go back in time
(I go back)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On the roof that rainy night)

Everytime I feel the need
(When I feel the need)
I envision you caressing me
(I envision you over and over and over again)
And go back in time
(I go back)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
(It was oh so sweet you and I)
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On that rainy night)

Everytime I feel the need
(Last night I had the strangest dream...)
I envision you caressing me
(It actually quite symbolic)
And go back in time
(As I whispered...that I loved you)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
(...very subtly)

Everytime I feel the need
(Infamous ya don't stop, Infamous rocks your box)
I envision you caressing me (Infamous knock out the box)
And go back in time 
To relieve the splendor of you and I (Infamous rocks your box)
On the rooftop that rainy night (infamous knocks em off the box)
