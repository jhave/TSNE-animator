[DJ Montay]
Yeah, one time, it's ya boi DJ Montay right
We got a brand new dance comin for you
I don't care if you from the East coast, West coast
Midwast, down South, but when that beat drop
You gotta be on point - bring it back
Top Quality Productions, Oomp Camp~!
DJ Unk, tell 'em how to do it shorty

[Unk]
Catch the beat like me, bounce your body like this
You can do it by yourself, go on and bounce on that bitch
I'm so fresh out the press, Grey Goose on the rocks
Bring it back, hit the stage with my balm in my socks
Now these hoes wanna jock, hear my song so they cop
Lean your shoulders to the beat and if you can't you need to stop
Everybody bring it back like the trap, set up shop
Fuck a hater, youse a snitch, you a flashlight cop
Bring it back in the Chevy, leanin in the droptop
Smokin purp', watch 'em work, you can bounce, you can rock
Lean back like the Maybach, cool and relaxed
Now they see I'm certified, dig him bitch, yeah we back
Hey, now bring it back

[Chorus]
(AYYY) bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Catch the beat like this (AYYY) bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Catch the beat like this (AYYY) bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Catch the beat like this (AYYY) bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back

[Unk]
You ridin big? Bring it back! Hit the mall, jump fresh
Spend a stack - bring it back! Hit the club, sippin Goose
and the 'gnac - bring it back! Throwin up my hood niggaz
where you at? Bring it back! Smokin kush, gettin head
in the 'llac - bring it back! Hell naw, fuck that
Break your back - bring it back! Bounce with it, lean with it
Ride that - bring it back! DJ Montay on the track
Bring it back, bring it back - Westside, Bankhead
Bring it back, bring it back - in Decatur where it's greater
Bring it back, bring it back - ridin down MLK
Bring it back, bring it back - on that L, might as well
bring it back, bring it back - ATL e'rybody like this

[Chorus]

[DJ Montay]
Aight, aight, aight, aight
Some of y'all know what I'm talkin 'bout out there
Some of y'all don'
I got my partner DJ Unk right, that's about to tell y'all how this thing go
DJ Unk... ah crank 'em up!

[Unk]
Now crank it up (crank it up) crank it up (crank it up)
Bounce with it, lean with it, crank it up (crank it up)
Now ride out (ride out) now ride out (ride out)
Now bring it back to the beat ride out (ride out)
Now catch the beat, catch the beat like this (like this)
If you can't bounce, don't bounce, just quit (just quit)
Now bring it back (bring it back) now bring it back (bring it back)
Now run for it like this, bring it back, catch the beat like this

[Chorus]

Uh, uhh uhh (*repeat 8X*}</pre>
