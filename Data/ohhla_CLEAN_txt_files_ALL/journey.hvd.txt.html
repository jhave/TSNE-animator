[Heavy D - Intro]
Here's to you...
You have gone through struggles, suffering..
This one goes out to everybody in the world, but especially on the street level
Because I know where you comin from and some of the things you do, I can understand
So through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

What is a friend for? Through rich and through poor
Kinda like a marriage balanced on a differnet floor
A friend could tell you things that he wouldn't tell another
So in essence, a friend could be considered a brother
You laugh and you play a lot, you talk and you say a lot
But when it's time to feel the pain, you cry and you pray a lot
I'm talkin about you, you who have the time
A time to be my friend when no one else would be mine
Problems were nothing because I had my man to share them with
Hills were nothing neither, 'cause I had my man to climb 'em with
I'm really proud to say that I truly really knew you good
And oh, God's blessing from the entire neighborhood
And as the days drift, drift into the future
I laugh a little louder at the times that I was witcha
This one's for you and I truly hope you hear me
And through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Chorus 2X: K-Ci &amp; Jojo] (Heavy D)
You'rrrrrrrre on my miiiiiiiiiiiind (You're on my mind)
And I wish you a peaceful journey (Peace!)
Brother I hope you hear me

[Heavy D]
In the corner, sits the little girl in tears
The shadow of a man overwhelms her fears
"Mommy, mommy, NO!", the words of a battered child
The wicked, wicked mommy has the sticks swingin buckwild
"Mister, mister, do you have a dime?
See, I'm hungry and I'd rather be a begger than do crime" 
Sure - here's your dime, go make a big ten bucks
Now sneak around the corner, get your joints and go beat him up
A kid on the streets, doesn't want to be beat
So he hangs on the block 'til his pop fall asleep
Missing kids on the milk carton
A lunatic kills kids for kicks and gets pardoned
Baby girls run away from home, huh
and two months later, they're stars on child porn
Tracks on the arms of a minor
Suzie ran too, but she'll be dead when they find her
Kids on the street movin drugs, the thugs' growin up fast
Wouldn't stop when one gets plunged
Junior stole a Benz with his friends
But got caught, now he's doin time with twenties and tens
For the rest of his life, he learns to lean on the wall
And prays for the day when his number is called
This one if for you and I truly hope you heard me
Through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Chorus 2X]

[Instrumental for about 19 seconds]

[Heavy D]
Pardon me, mister warden, I'm askin for a pass
to come for some of my brothers who made mistakes in the pass
It's really not their fault, you see - times are HARD
and it was probably difficult for my man to find a job
Before he was forced, forced to make a living
by lying, stealing, and eventually killing
No one was born bad, we're all God's Kids
So who's to really blame for the wrong that he did?
And speakin about the law, what are they for?
To beat us with a stick face down on the floor?
You preach and you preach that you want crime to stop
If you want crime to stop, stop hiring crooked cops
So hear me brother man, hear my plea!
If you want success all you gotta do is suc-ceed
Love, life, pain, death
What else is left on the travels of life's steps?
In life, we lose, get bumped and bruised
The road you choose not necessarily a cruise
You giggle for joy, shed a tear for pain
There's a lot to lose, and a lot to gain
Though when you walk on the streets, try to walk on street smarts
When you see your man down, try to have a little heart
This one if for you and I truly hope you heard me
Through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Chorus 4X w/ ad-libs and variations]

[Heavy D]
Yeah, you're on my mind...
Peace...
Hear me now brother

[K-Ci]
Stop your killing, stop your killing
Stop your stealing, stop your stealing
Stop your killing, stop your killing
Stop your killiiiii-ehhhhh-eeeeaaasah...
Huurrrrrrrr.....WHOO!

Take my hand, take my hand
If you need somebody, you can trust on ME!
Ha, you can lean on me
Yes, you can errrr-aaaaahh-yaaahyaah...</pre>
