[Intro: Joe Budden]
AYOOOOOOOOOO!!!!

[Chorus 1: Nate Dogg]
Come quick, see
If you have a way wit' me
I know you wanna play me
All night, night, niiiiiiiiight
Girl look, see
Everything in the club is free
That's how it is when you wit' an O.G
Wit' big money
Girl we gon' leave
Right after this party

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
1, 2, 3 and to the fo'
Tell me what's good y'all its ya boy Joe
No need to answer y'all already know
Plenty fifths of Vodka, few jars of dro
I give a fuck if they play this on the radio
G'z in the buildin its all gravy though
I jus came for a lil bit fellatio
Cause 25 to 1 is the ratio
Got cops outside, "Like nah this can't be"
No need to ice grill we all family
We all got cash, none of us iz punks
But my rachet on me, yours iz in the trunk
Think that through fam, minds well quit here
Cause you won't get a chance to get there
Now lets RIDE
Baby lets SLIDE
If you wan' RIDE
Car iz out SIDE
Gangstaz lets RIDE

[Chorus 2: Nate Dogg w/ (Joe Budden)]
This is a Gangsta Party(Uh, uh)
We came to smoke in this party(Ok)
Lets get it crunk in this party(Oh)
We (Whoa)came (Whoa)to drink in this party(Whoa)
What's up but after this party(What's good?)
We came to leave wit' somebody
(How about yo' team, meet up wit my team and I'ma show y'all how gangstaz lean)
(AYOOOOOOOOOO!!!!)

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Come wit me
Lemme know if you smoke that weed
What do we have here now, if you puff la, la, la
I mean la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Look baby I'ma thug and gentleman, so I'll buy you a Corona
And at the same time try to bone ya
I won't stalk ya, keep tryna fone ya
I'll pass the ounce, get as high as you want ta
Leave wit a G, what harm'll do ya
Won't dim the lights and throw on some Luther
Legs behind, head in the headboard calm and soother
Like ma get looser
When's the last time you had a Don seduce ya
Look here this is rap this ain't Karma Sutra
Now lets RIDE
Baby lets SLIDE
If you wan' RIDE
Car iz out SIDE
Gangstaz lets RIDE

[Chorus 2: Nate Dogg w/ (Joe Budden)]
This is a Gangsta Party(Uh, uh)
We came to smoke in this party(Ok)
Lets get it crunk in this party(Oh)
We (Whoa)came (Whoa)to drink in this party(Whoa)
What's up but after this party(What's good?)
We came to leave wit' somebody
(How about yo' team, meet up wit my team and I'ma show y'all how gangstaz lean)
(AYOOOOOOOOOO!!!!)

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Lets get up tonite
Lemme know who wanna fuck tonite
When we done we can break up tonite
I had a wonderful time, thanks but goodnite
Got my teeaamm wit me, if you like me
If she ain't wifey, then she can't be seenn wit me
All of these hoes wanna seeemmm pretty
But you the only one I wanna brriiinngg wit me
Need to chill ma
On real ma
Only thing I chase is a dolla bill ma
So before I go ahead and get the champagne poppin
Hoe lemme know if it ain't a damn thing poppin
Leave at three, arrive at four
At five get live, at six you'll want more
Now lets RIDE
Baby lets SLIDE
If you wan' RIDE
Car iz out SIDE
Gangstaz lets RIDE

[Chorus 2: Nate Dogg w/ (Joe Budden)]
This is a Gangsta Party(Uh, uh)
