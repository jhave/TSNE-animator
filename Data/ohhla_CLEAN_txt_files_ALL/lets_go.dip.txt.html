[Marvin Gaye]
I've been really tryin' baby
Tryin' to hold back these feelings for so long
And if you feel like I feel baby
Come on
Ohhh come on
Woo
Let's get on

[Little Kid's Voice]
Let's get it on nigga

[Cam'Ron]
Ah man
Lets get it on man
Santana you on your own man
Lets do it man
Dipset
We got these bastards
Man let's do it

[Juelz Santana]
Uh, you nigga's dealin' with a G from the block
Yeah it's me from the block
Quick to tell a nigga' (Let's get it on)
But I don't really like to beef on the block
That bring heat to the block
I got ta' eat on the block nigga' (Let's get it on)
Yeah you dealin' with a pimp from the hood
Keep a chick from the hood
Quick to tell her aye (Let's get it on)
Come on
Let's go
I'm tryin' to do it so aye (Let's get it on)
I'm one hell of a guy
Fly fella' can fly
Like Scarface one hell of a high (Let's get it on)
One hell of a ride
That I ride, 23's look like the pellas' [propellers] on side (Let's get it on)
Who stuntin' like me?
Who frontin' like me?
Who did it, who get it, who done it like me?
You? (Let's get it on)
Who wishin', who frontin', who want it from me?
You? Come get it, you want it, it's nothing to me
You? (Let's get it on)
Yup, already know how I feel
When it comes to pumpin' that steel
It's like (Let's get it on)
You know with these ride boys toke time up with the cowboy ropes
So (Let's get it on)
Uh, let's get it on y'all
Uh, it's love (Let's get it on)
Hey ma, back that ass up
Lookin' back almost crashed up
So (Let's get it on)
That's love right there
Hit em' one more time
[Let's get it on, on, on]  Fades till end</pre>
