[Intro: Chino XL]
Yeah, y'all want to be conscious rapper right?
Hit you in your head. Make you an unconscious rapper
Chino XL. JS. What's good homie? Long time comin' nahmean?
Shells through your vehicle nigga

[Verse One: Chino XL]
First of all, if I may
Explain the many ways JS will murder a DJ
The way I murder wordplay
Hip hop is dead in a state of dismay
I desecrated your favorite MC, while JS diggin' in the crates
It not just bravado, before Serato
He made records revolve like a Molotov 
Cocktail without the bottle
Chino, your favorite mulatto
Spit it stakato 
Controversial like Bill Cosby's illegitimate child
Somebody must of not a
Got the memorandum how I randomly murder 
Throw a tantrum, hurt a civilian unwillin' 
?, I've been waitin' to put shells through your vehicle 
Behind the wheel, you survive it, it's a miracle
I'm from the days of niggas robbin' you for your British
And Wallabees and Al B Square mall
Before +Here To Save You All+ 
Changed metaphor forever 
Makin' verbal war more clever 
Behind closed doors most say my pen pushin' better
Than half of the game
Presentin' itself is the truth
No one remains that has disrespected my name in the booth
I don't entertain
I'm makin' it reign with my point of view
It's insane, I couldn't live with myself if I was you
Strugglin' to make the next dance step that look stupid
Fuck Valentine's Day, I'm shootin' hollow points at Cupid
Chino and JS, the ladies scream
A cycle that lasts forever like broken washin' machines
If JS ain't playin' your track it must not be crack
If Chino ain't rhymin' then you can ask for your money back
The west coast show stopper
I'm ill and hood proper
Beef? You get hit on like any woman workin' at Foot Locker
The world feels my grammar
Women love me like Hannah Montana
The Puerto Rican leans like a cholo then pulls a hammer
Before New York was gang signs and bandannas
J used his turntables like guitar of Carlos Santana
Before Jay-Z screwed up Def Jam releases
I've been the +Lyrical Jesus+ last of dying species

[Chorus: scratched]
"It's on till the death" - Inspectah Deck
"Keep it movin'" - Inspectah Deck
"Amongst dead men walkin'" - Common
"You'll wish you never knew me" - 
"It's on till the death, till we settle the score" 
"Keep it movin' in the mean streets" - Inspectah Deck
"It's on till the death" - Inspectah Deck
"When you see me it's real" - Raekwon
"Bitch niggas scared to death" - Busta Rhymes
"Oh shit!" - Madd Rapper
"Show you how we do it Queens" - Mobb Deep
"Murder ain't shit nigga" - Mobb Deep
"Calm down, before the police come" -

[Verse Two: Sean Price]
Yo, Sean Price
Punk you're not me
The glock pop three and I get away scott free
P!
Ain't no tellin' what I do for a dollar 
I'm not your father, but guess what I'ma do to your mama
Troop with the llama
Catch you sleepin', shoot your pajamas
Niggas scared to death, I'm cool
Hakuna Matata 
(gun shots)
God father, the squad got large armor and such
Talk shit and you will get touched
Rock steadily, your nut popped
He's deadly for real
Pop bottles and listen to Heather Headly and chill
I do not rock, but don't Heather Headly and chill
I just needed somethin' to rhyme with, I'm deadly for real
Listen
JS-1, he be the DJ
Sean got guns
Fuck 'em, sell 'em on Ebay
Ride with the guns like duke on Crime Partners
Plus Priest's a beast bitch so why bother?
P!
