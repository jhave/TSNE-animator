[Z-Ro]
Houston Texas is my city, Ridgemont 4 is my block
I put my trust in no man, only my motherfucking glock
Cause she ain't never let me down, before
Fuck a gang I follow my bitch, cause she be busting rounds for Ro
Unlike my homies, cause they phony than a motherfucker
Even my broad, cause she might be fucking some other brother
Lord knows, that I couldn't take it if I found out
Premeditated, cause I'm about to let them automatic rounds out
A prisoner of my own mind, losing it swiftly
Clicking on motherfuckers, until the reaper come and get me
Fuck a friend and a click, and a partner in crime
Cause when you doing your bid, they won't be partners in time
I bet they be the main reason, why you locked up in a county
That's why I strive, to keep all the busta bitches from round me
So take it how you wanna take it, i don't give a damn
I'm an asshole by nature, nigga this is who I am

[Hook - 2x]
I know they told y'all, deep down South we don't play
Don't get too close, cause nigga I'm gon spray
Everyone of y'all, piss me off and you gon see me touch
Your noggin y'all, that's who I am nigga fuck you

[Z-Ro]
Don't worry my nigga, I'm coming to make your bail
Wait a second, how this buster know I'm going to jail
I seen the hatred in they faces, when the prince wanted to see me
When they thought I was leaving, they wanted to D-E-A-D me
Dropping salt on my name, saying I sold my soul
And these suppose to be my people, damn my people so cold
Why not be happy for a nigga, when he make a major move
Chill you playing with this game, but I've been paying major dues
I can't tell a motherfucker, how to fly a plane
If I ain't never been up in the cockpit, you feeling me mayn
I got a bunch of records sold, and y'all ain't sold shit
Your foreign's at a standstill, but my Houptie's on the road bitch
Beef with me nigga, and you can find out
How I murder niggas with my lyrics, I ain't gotta pull my iron out
Take it how you wanna take it, i don't give a damn
Fuck them niggas who say they down, one deep is who I am

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
I'ma follow the truth, and never follow lies
So I'ma ride on Watts, until his fat ass apologize
For saying what he said, about Screw
Look who your style is named after motherfucker, you number two
And you know what come before one, nigga this mouthpiece
Z-Ro and S.U.C., Southside super hero
Fucking with you pussies, cause it's time you be tampered with
When you see me look me in the eyes, and pull up your pamper bitch
My nigga named Tommy, say he's coming to get ya
His people gon be swinging, everyone of em'll hit ya
Holding on to my grudges, until my brain get a blister
I love drama so much, because my life is so rough
So when you see me out in public, don't you come at me wrong
Disrespect me if you ain't, hoe I'ma fuck up your dome
You can take it how you wanna take it, I don't give a damn
Street Military was my father, Z-Ro is who I am
