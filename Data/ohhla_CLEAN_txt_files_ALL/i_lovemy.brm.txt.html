[Busta Rhymes]
I love my girl 'cause she know she the shit
Swagger kind of ill, she ain't scared of the dick
Got her own gig, though she act kinda rude
Does she know my money large and spend her dough on a dude
Real life chick, let her fuck wit' a thug
Sip the Martini quick, and wanna fuck in the club
'Cause.. see that's my chick.. that's my chick..
That's my chick.. 'cause she the shit
And she the type keep shit on low
Never stress the kid when I'm surrounded with hoes
If you knew the shit that she be doin to me
In the club, in the crib, or when I'm pushin the V
See, shorty ass be all over the place
Nigga front, she prolly put the acid all in your face for me
'Cause that's my chick.. that's my chick..
'Cause that's my chick.. and she the shit

[Chorus] + [Break]

[Busta Rhymes]
You see my bitch, she a one of a kind
I know you wish ya bitch was a rider like mine (Aaaahhh!)
When you see my chick, you know my shorty a dime
When she rollin wit' a nigga she be skippin the line
Listen, the type to reserve the ass for a nigga
And if I have to skip town, she hold a stash for a nigga
I'm sayin.. 'cause that's my chick.. that's my chick..
'Cause that's my chick.. 'cause she the shit
I know you buggin on the way shit sound
But you know I love the way my bitch be holdin it down
Extremely thorough by the way she reppin it hard
Travel anywhere, my shorty come fuck with the God
Bust it, mami always quick to feud when she can
Even if she have to get up and just lie on the stand
I'm sayin.. that's my chick.. that's my chick..
'Cause that's my chick.. and she the shit

[Chorus] + [Break]</pre>
