[DMX]
Let us pray
I thank you Lord for my birth, and everything that's followed
I thank you Lord for TODAY, and I will pray for tomorrow
I THANK YOU LORD for the love of my life and a friend
I made a promise - and I'm lovin my wife til the end
I thank you Lord for your GUIDANCE, cause it's all that counts
And RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW?!  Lord, this is your house
I THANK YOU LORD for a dream that came true to light
and I ask you to bless everybody, in this room tonight
I don't always do the right thing, and I ask you to forgive me
cause I need you hear wit me
Without you in my life, it's empty
I THINK BACK how some people did me like, violence was the remedy
and because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy
Not because of what I'll do - but because they don't know
There's somethin BETTER AFTER HERE - and everybody, won't go
So I ask you to forgive them, and we'll hope they see
And I thank you for the love that, they've given to me
I WILL NOT ABUSE IT, nor will I lead them astray
You see I love em like children, that I see everyday
And I pray.. no, WE PRAY, together
to get us through the bad weather, and we love you forever
Let YOUR THOUGHT, and my heart, go hand in hand
I FIRST THOUGHT, but to start, but I stand a man
And for as long as I can, as long as you permit me
Please give me, the strength I need to live
Bear with me -- amen.

We each walk the path, that you've chosen
Yes..

Chorus: DMX

I'm ready to meet him cause where I'm livin ain't right
Black hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the lord

[DMX]
Lord, you left me stranded, and I don't know why
Told me to live my life, now I'm ready to die
Ready to fly, I cry, but I shed no tears
You told me you would dead those fears, it's been years
Snakes still comin at me - just missin
Sometimes I think all you do with me is just listen
I thought that I was special - that's what you told me
Homey - stop actin like you don't know me
What'd I do so bad that it sent you away from me?
Not only sent you away, but made you stay away from me?
(My child I'm here, as I've always been
 It is you who went away and now are back again
 What did I say?)  Follow your word, and be true
(What did you do?)  Well, what I wanted to do
(What have you seen?)  Darkness and hell at a glance
(What do you want?)  All I want is another chance

Chorus 2X

[DMX]
(Just because you went away, my doors are not locked
 Wanna come back home?  All you gotta do is knock)
You see I left home a boy, but returned as a man
Full grown, and I'm still not able to stand
(I gave you a hand)  Well, but I was lookin the wrong way
Figured out the plan, then I started to pray
And that prayer, took me from here - over there
- back to over here, now it got me like where
- do I belong, do I fit in?
Things on my mind, where do I begin?
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart
I'm really tryin to win, so where do we start?
(Thou shalt not steal)  But what if he stole from me?
(Thou shalt not kill)  But what if he's tryin to kill me?
(Thou shalt not, take my, name in vain
 No matter how hard it rains, withstand the pain)

Chorus 2X

[DMX]
I'm ready to meet him -- our father, who art in heaven
I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance at twenty-seven
No longer afraid to knock on your door
Not scared anymore to lose my life in the war
After what I just saw, I'm ridin with the Lord
Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword
And now that I've seen, what I need to see
Please take me, where I - need to be
(What have you learned?)  It's better to tell the truth than to lie
(What have you learned?)  To love my life until I die
(What have you learned?)  Violence isn't always the key
(What have you learned?)  You can't always believe what you see
(What have you learned?)  It's better to forgive and forget
(What have you learned?)  Give as you expect to get
(What have you learned?)  That I can't go on without you
(What have you learned?)  I musta been a fool to ever doubt you!

Chorus 2X

[DMX]
I'm ready to meet him
I'm ready to meet him
I'm ready to meet him
I'm ready to meet him
I'm ready to meet him</pre>
