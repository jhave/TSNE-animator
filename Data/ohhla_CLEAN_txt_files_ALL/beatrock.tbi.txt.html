So everywhere I go yo, fans be like "Where you from?"
You know, whether it be New York or the UK
And I be like ummm... "I'm from DC"
Yeah, and they don't believe it, you know
So I just tell them this right here
"Let the beat rock, let the beat rock, let the beat rock..."
I said "Let it rock..."
"I'm from DC, I'm from DC"

I be rollin' with some dudes that always love to break the mother fucking rules
And yeah, know a couple D's that'll stir the shoes right off your mother fucking feet
Yeah, they be goin' hard all in the streets, make sure they don't take your heart
Naw, not little me I got the lead part, I'm a fittin' to shoot the movie
G's, bammers on the block been there for years, I don't think it's ever gonna stop
No, they been getting' doses, just say no, might as well say hell yeah
And yeah, I'm from North-East, Langdon Park, don't remember Trinidad for me
So, let the beat rock, let the beat rock, let the beat rock
I said, let it rock
I'm from DC

Sure, everybody this, everybody that
But I know that them cats poor
And yeah, as a matter of fact everybody rap but they ain't doin' no tours
And uh, what the fuck is that bammers on the bus, but they rappin' 'bout they dope cars
Naw, I'm a point 'em out babe, I'm a point 'em out babe
Bammers think they hard just 'cause they saw a little Scarface movie
Naw, girls think they hot just 'cause they got a little couple dudes on them
Naw, this what a dude why I make sure I don't mother fucking talk to them
So, let the beat rock, let the beat rock, let the beat rock
I said, let it rock
I'm from DC

If you lookin' for a man that's on his two feet standing
You can go with me, you can go with me
If you wanna make it big and you wanna hang with the cool kids
You can roll with me, you can roll with me
You can roll with me, you can roll with me
Have you ever seen a fly guy, have you ever seen a fly guy?
Well if you ever see a fly guy, well if you ever see a fly guy
I hope you know it's me, I hope you know it's me
I hope you know it's me, I hope you know it's me
Let the beat rock, let the beat rock, let the beat rock</pre>
