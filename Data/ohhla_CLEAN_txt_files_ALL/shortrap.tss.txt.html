Short rap (echo)
 repeat X2

Short rap, is everything
It's what I think, it's what I sing
Cause I'm a rapper, who lets you know
When it comes to music, I will grow
Rap more raps than any MC
Your rap ain't rap cause your rap ain't me
Short rap, is what you find
The mastermind, Short rap that rhyme
Too Short baby, that's the name
When I rap my rap I rap that game
I tell it to you like you always knew
Short rap's not fake, it's always true
It's me, it's you, short rap is life
It's everyday and every night
And I don't just say it's this and that
It's everything, it's what Short rap's

 Short Rap (echo)
Itz what?
 Short Rap(echo)
Fresh
 Short Rap(echo)
 Short Rap(echo)
 Short Rap(echo)

S-H-O-R-T-R-A-P
Short rap is what i call this beat
Rap that rap like no one else
I'm Sir Too Short all by myself
I make fresh raps without your help
And all I want is fame and wealth
Smooth in the game, just like that
And all you hear me say is rap

 Short (echo)

Short rap, is way to hard
Every I stop, it's time to start
Cause what you find, when i say rhymes
Is a non-stop rap, right on time
I'm the kind of person you always thought
Couldn't make a record that would be bought
Sir Too Short, it couldn't be
Short rap, what's that, Short rap is me

 Short Rap(echo)
 Short Rap(echo)
So so fresh

I like tenders, young and hot
You never hear Short say baby why not?
I'm Sir Too Short, I'm so down
MC rapper from the Oakland town
You better get up, Short raps a song
It really ain't Short, it's much too long
Cause I don't stop, once I start
Short rap, what's that, Short rap is art
Took my rap to the neighborhood
From day one Too Short was good
True MC's make Sucka MC's
In my time they rap like me
A brotha said Short, he's good as you
Saw me on stage and learned the truth
I was born, to hit the tops
Short rap, I don't stop

 Short Rap(echo)
 Short Rap(echo)
 Short Rap(echo)
 
Short rap has now affected you
Short rap won't stop until I get through
Short rap could knock, 
Sucka MC's stop biting on you and start biting on me
And i won't get mad, cause I'm so bad
The rap you have is the rap I had
Now if you want, my new Short rap
You can put it in your shorts and bite on that
Sucka MC, you know I'm fresh
A rap in my trash can top your best
Check it out boy, here and now
How will you rap when you don't know how
I wish I could hear you answer that
It just won't work and that's Short rap
Try to make you understand
Don't make more raps, just be a fan

 Short Rap(echo)
 
Short rap, is it sad or funny
I thought you knew Short rap is money
Sucka MC, you don't need help
All you need to do is something else
Cause MC rapper's are all around
And sucka MC's are like bloodhounds
Sniffing away, to find a rhyme
Just quit rapping and you won't rap mine
Short rap, I'm so hard
She got her butter on my candy bar
No time to play, just work and work
I gotta kick back, call me bizurke
Cause that's just all she made me go
Toss it up Short, I know you know
Short rap, is everything
Her worst nightmare, her wettest dream
Her mind, her body, short rap is life
She's just a friend, she's not my wife
I wouldn't even let her in my car
And the babe said I'm her lucky star
I'm a fresh young bachelor, I roll Caddy
86 her cause she said daddy
But that's not it, it wasn't that
Short rap is life so let me rap
I gotta stop sooner, but I'll stop later
I'm her man, I'm not a player
And i know just what she's thinking of
Sir Too Short, and all her love
But then she asked for my love back
And all I had was Too Short raps
I can't lie, I tried to try
Your fun not one, but don't asked why

 Short Rap(echo)
 Short Rap(echo)
Is everything
 Short Rap(echo)
 Short Rap(echo)
I don't stop, baby

Short rap, is everything
It's what i think, It's what I sing
Short rap, in stereo
Short is what you think you know
Your rap is fresh, but look at me
I rap more rhymes than any MC
Living so close up on the hill
Short rap won't stop, it never will(echo)</pre>
