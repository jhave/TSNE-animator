[Lil Wayne]
The hottest under the sun 
Ain't nobody fuckin' me man
Haha and you already know that pimpin' yeah
Cash Money records where dream's come true
Fuck up my dreams somebody gon' die tonight
And you already know that pimpin' 
Hay, it's Cash Money Records man a lawless game

[Verse 1]
Un fuckin believable, Lil Wayne's the president
Fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy, than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch, call me Kevin Federline
It's obvious, that he'll be Cash Money til' the death of him
The ground shall break, when they bury him (bury him)
I know one day they gotta bury him
Better lock my casket tight baby, so I don't let the devil in
Nigga it's just me and my guitar, yeah bitch, I'm heavy metaling
You can get the fuckin Led Zeppelin
Niggas is bitches, bitches, I think they full of estragine
Than we hold court and take your life for the settlement
Yeah, plus I'm the best and no I aint positive I'm definite
I know the game like I'm reffin it
This is the Carter, the Carter 3, The New Testament
And I'm the god and this is what I bless 'em with

[Hook]
Bitch I'm me, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you, you're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin Cash money millionaire
I know that ain't fare, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin Cash money millionaire, bitch

[Verse 2]
Junior! It's Cash Money over everything
It's in my blood, I feel it running in every vein
I'm from the mud, i'am a missile like a scud
What's really good, I'm bout the Rawkus like Thud
And I stayed on my flow and Cash Money like a rug
Tied to the fuckin' Birdman like a Lug
And dear Mr. Ronald Williams to you
I shall forever give thanks like a pilgrim
Cash Money million..heir to the throne
Goin' at there heads, like hairs in a comb
Sitting by the window, I just stare at the stones
Know I might get through it like hair in a comb
Money over bitches, my niggas trust my senses
I will take it like desher as the lord as my witness
And you have all witnessed, but I am not finished
Keep your mouth closed and let your eyes listen

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Last year they had the grammy's, and left me in miami
Sleepin' on a nigga, like I'm rappin in my jammies
I'm rappin' when you sleep, I was rappin when you were in jammies
Mel Gibson flow, Lethal Weapon, book them Danny
I'm a monster I tell you, monster Wayne
I have just swallowed the key to the House Of Payne
Now I'm stuck here to deal with the houses pain
Fuck with me and I will peal, like the house's paint
Let's go, niggas don't know seamon cause I'm better in boat
The only time I will depend is when I'm 70 years old
That's when I can't my hold shit within, so I shit on myself
Cause I'm so sick of tired shittin' on everybody else
I'm tryin' to tell you like I'm sayin' somethin'
I'm from the dirty like the bottom of my pants cuff
And there nothin' gon' stop me, so just envy it
Hay? i'll except a friendly quit! haha

[Hook]
