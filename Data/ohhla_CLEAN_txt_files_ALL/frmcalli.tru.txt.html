Yeah bitches.
We got the motherfuckin niggas from Cali, ya know what I'm sayin?
E-A-Ski, Rally Ral and Master P.
But yo Ski.
Kick it like this G.

[E-A-Ski]
A nigga don't get no respect
Unless a motherfucker gotta come and snap some necks
So I play that game like it 'posed to be played
Cause Ski and CMT is not the one that's gonna daze
Yeah I see niggas jockin niggas like a bitch
Just cause the punk made one local hit
Even my homies get brainwashed by that shit
The look at me and say, "man Ski is doin it"
Fuck all that, I ain't givin up props
Until I hear the motherfuckin nigga album drop
So I get pissed and take it out on wax
And think how the fuck they sign this one dimensional artist to a damn
contract
But life moves on, huh
And while it's movin I write about it in my fuckin songs
I pack a nine double L just incase
I talk shit and they wanna front me to my face
Punk niggas wanna get respect
But disrespect, but it don't even work like that
It's all about the mighty dollar
Whoever controls the dead presidents control the power
So watch your back in this game see
Cause niggas get lame see, but they can't fuck with me
I might be humble but I'm only givin ????
So motherfuckers can't jack a nigga from Cali

[CMT]
Yeah bitches just like that, ya know what I'm sayin?
But yo, another nigga from Cali.
His name is Rally Ral.
So yo Ral.
School these motherfuckers.

[Rally Ral]
When will motherfuckers learn, fuckin around with me you get burned
It's all a battle brother, comin up on it firm
Nine one was the year for school
And nine two's for rules
And nine three's for rulin
Huh, any motherfucker out there
You keep fuckin around I have you rappin in a wheelchair
Cause Rally Ral don't play no way
I'd rather slay a motherfucker like all day
So I'm a rock it on till the end then
It's a neccessity for me to keep lendin
Funky tracks for the wack to improve on
Listen to the nigga Rally or move on
Because I got rhymes for the young and old
I got a style for the middle class and low
Whoever said that Rally Ral couldn't deliver
I have your fuckin ass goin up a river
Just like a boat goin mainstream
I have your fuckin body doin the same thing
So now you know not to fuck around with Rally
A nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga from Cali

[CMT]
Yeah that's a nigga you don't wanna fuck with but yo.
This is another motherfuckin nigga from Cali.
Master P.
So yo P.
Do me a favor man.
Slip it.

[Master P]
Slip in my motherfuckin ??? feelin fucked up
Three niggas from Cali in this game and done came up
Livin but never givin and givin but steady livin
And droppin more motherfuckin shit then a stage of pigeons
Rollin, three niggas we hella deep
??? the gat in the hood when you know me
The M, the A, the S, the T, the E, the R
And if you fuck with the P
You won't live to see a month cause I'm a nigga out the game
Makin that bank, I'm from the motherfuckin bay so I'm fuckin with dank
And if a nigga cold run up he get's done up
Jacked for his motherfuckin daytons cause it's a come up
California, the state of the homocides
Niggas into bangin and doin fuckin drive by's
So welcome to my motherfuckin hood bitch
I told you last year that P don't take no bullshit
And if you run up and run up and run up and run up and run up
Bam motherfuckin punk you get done up
Huh, in other words you get tossed like salad
