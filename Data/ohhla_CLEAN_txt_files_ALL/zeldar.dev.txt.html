[Aliens talking]
Welcome to the show and tell convention on Mars
Do anybody have something to show or... tell?

[Devin The Dude as Zeldar talking]
I'm Zeldar, from the planet Beldar
Which is eight million judibeeks from Saturn
I was on my way home one day when thrown off pattern
Landed on earth, no where to go... a hole in my megaboomp (hehehe)
Landed in a field with green leafy trees... looked kind of odd to me
So... I (sniff)) smoked it (sniff)

[Devin The Dude as Zeldar]
I took my stellcutter, cut it and smoked it and guess how I felt
Very good, I took some for myself
Back to my spaceship, I gave some it my family
They say, "(Sniff, ahh) what you call this?" weed... 
(Stuttering) My name is Zeldar
I'm from, from planet "Deldar" my name is Zeldar
And we shop at WalMart
I came back, just to grab me another fat sack of the
Green leafy thing I found in the field
Yea they call it kill
I rolled into the hood
I'm greeted, but it wasn't all good
I saw mixed people all kinds of colors and they looked at me like I was weird
They call me queer
I say, "No... My name is Zeldar,
I'm from planet Beldar, my leader is Zeldar
and we shop at Walmart"
(Stuttering... ahhh) I have kids
I don't give them none of the green leafy stuff that I found in the field
Cause it might do them harm, but I'm old enough
So I cough and I puff on the
Green leafy stuff I found in the field... yeah I call it kill

"What'd you say your name was?"
"My name is Zeldar"</pre>
