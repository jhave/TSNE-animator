"Wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned..." --&gt; Rakim
	(repeat 2X)
"Wake you up and as I stare in your..."	(repeat 2X)

"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
[Prodigy] Remember P, the one you got your whole style from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
[Prodigy] Remember me, the one you got your rhyme style from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
[Prodigy] Remember P, the one you got your rhyme style from?

	"Yo it's the P" *cut and scratched*

Verse One: Prodigy

Yo, disperse from off this, who the culprits
that claim to be the newest, rappin bullshit
My rhymes, get Ruger endorsements, my song boost
and the tech sales through the ceiling, let's talk with guns
Convo til the po-lice come
Give you a red shirt with the wet hat to match
First max like it's Hamburger Hill for real
It's Red Dawn when the Mobb get it on, my outfit
stuck on some wild out shit, all about it
We move gambit, through the overcrowded
Forthwith, pull out long fifths, extended clips
Point the nozzle and shift your back disc
Me and the click-a, sit down and eat dinner
Wake up every mornin write a new banger
that strike harder than your best attempt to sound like P
or the H-A-V-O-C, nigga

"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
[Rebel INS] Remember me, the one you got the technique from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
[Rebel INS] Remember me, the one you got your freestyle from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
[Rebel INS] Remember Deck, I told y'all, Protect Ya Neck

	"I'm Rebel INS your highness" *cut and scratched*

[Inspectah Deck]
Fake one, take one, no ultimatum face one
There's no escape from straight from the grain come the great one
My blade swung, decapitate your snake head
Slit your snake tongue make one false maneuver you a mystery
Unsolved, the mob that revolves automatically involved
musclebound sounds surround commercial thugs
Rock turtledove bowery suits
and purple gloves, me and you can have some fun
Make it a blast, you couldn't take the impact
with steel shoulderpads, blood for blood
Veteran, covered in mud, wounded in the midst of war
Still tradin slugs gettin major love
Way above you newcomers, I come thunderin
with the heat of two summers when I enter the zone
Move mountains with the presence alone before the words
rip through the microphone, chrome dipped lyrics
are known to split stone, you private eyes home in
but can't seem to clone

"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
[Big Pun] Remember Pun, the one you bit your whole shit from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
[Big Pun] Remember Pun, I snatched away the moon and blew away the sun
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
[Big Pun] Remember Pun, the one with over a thousand guns

	"You start to suffer" *cut and scratched*

[Big Punisher]
Yo, Big Punisher's ready
Prodigy, Deck and me, QB ("Shaolin") and Bronx trilogy 
Lyrically hazardous for your wealth, swing on your world's piece
Foil your plans, boil your grams, take a shine
Fold all your hands, spoil your mans, make him mine
Take all you made, call you gay on Hot 97
Drop by your dwellin got the nueve right behind your melon
Ain't no tellin when the bullet's behind the trigger
I do it to live niggaz and Pulitzer Prize winners
You wouldn't survive nigga, if I chose you
Froze you from ear to ear, showin your whole vocal
Who told you, you could roll through, my lyrics practically rose you
from the grave, like The Crow's do	(*next lyrics overlap Scarface sample*)
I told you a long time ago, don't ever fuck me
cause if I leave you half dead ("Oahh-kay!" - T.M.) consider yourself
("You wanna play rough? - T.M.) very lucky, very ugly from the face up
Leave you laced up, Joey Crillz, Pros, Cuban Link, Triple Seis, WHAT?
