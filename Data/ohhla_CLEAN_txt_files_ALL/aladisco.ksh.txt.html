Disco
Disco
Discotheque

[Verse 1:]
Whatever V.I.P.
Sneekin' in the back
Corrupt the whole scene
Sure come scan my fake I'd
Sure buy me a ten dollar drink
I'll take you for a ride kid
If you got the balls if
You can take the discotheque
Uh

I got the joint
I know the spot
I got my ride tricked
I got the right fix
Boy can you hang with this

Where you wanna go is not the case
We're about to go to outer space
So come with me to my special place

[Chorus:]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Then we'll fall in love
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Under the Neon sign
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Watchin' the mirror ceilings
And dance all night
A la Discotheque
A la Discotheque
Discotheque

[Verse 2:]
Think you're so fresh, so fresh
So fresh
I'm sayin I'm not impressed
Let's roll to the East side
Hollywood's freeze dried (boring)
Then let's work it out
For you an exception
Come play in my direction
There's spray paint
There's whiskey
There's beats that make you
Rock til ya drop!
I got the joint
I know the spot
I got my ride tricked
I got the right fix
Boy can you hang with this

Where you wanna go is not the case
Oh-oh
We're about to go to outer space
So come with me to my special place

[Chorus:]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Then we'll fall in love
Oh-ohOh-oh
Under the Neon sign
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Watchin' the mirror ceilings
And dance all night
A la Discotheque
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

Discotheque
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

Discotheque
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

Discotheque
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Discotheque

Oh la more
(A la discotheque)
Got us by love
A La Discotheque!
I want to dance
With you my love
Discotheque
Discotheque
A la discotheque
Discotheque

[Chorus:]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Then we'll fall in love
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Under the Neon sign
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Watchin' the mirror ceilings
And dance all night
A la Discotheque
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Then we'll fall in love
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Under the Neon sign
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Watch in the mirror ceilings
An dance all night
A la Discotheque
Oh-oh

A la discotheque
