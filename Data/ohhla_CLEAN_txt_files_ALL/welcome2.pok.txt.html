[Hook]
(Welcome to Texas), where everything is bigger
If them boys want war, we put one in they liver
(Welcome to Texas), where we ball and parlay
Fuck pretty hoes, everyday all day
(Welcome to Texas), where the sun get hot
Guns get hot, FBI run in ya spot
(Welcome to Texas), this dope we mass producing
Act like you know, when y'all niggaz come to Houston

[H.A.W.K.]
H-O-U-S-T-O-N
With pimp hands for ends, and hard to apprehend
We made men gorillas, primitive cave men
Lord forgive me for my sins, in Jesus name amen
We spray men at will, with intent to kill
Do drug deals for thrills, and still remain real
Here's some'ing you can feel, you better respect my turf
For as long as you live, on this planet Earth

[Chris Ward]
Welcome to Texas, where we don't ride horses
Unless you like candy cab mayn, Ferarris and Porshes
Of course it's the truth, I'm still thugging in my youth
Riding with the bulletproof, in a Vette with no roof
Make bitch and snitch niggaz, disappear like poof
Cause our guns spit lead, just like verses in the booth
Chris Ward's the name, and I'm 3rd Coast born
Southside for life nigga, children of the corn

[C-Note]
We swarm like bees stacks G's, and blow trees
Move these ki's for these fees, enough ice to freeze
H-Town ride threes, Dallas boys roll D's
Them haters fall to they knees, my switches jump like fleas
Welcome to Texas drive Lexus, and live reckless
Screwed Up Click bitch, acting bad living trechrous
Surrounded by crumblers, you better play it how it go
Them boys down South, down to make this bitch snow

[Hook]

[Big Pokey]
I'ma represent Texas, till I'm under the grass
Cross that state line tripping, it's one in ya ass
We smash gas for cash, and duck the task team
Blast beams, and bleed corners for mad cream
Take it to the extreme, it's about the Clutch
Bust down ducks, and hug utility trucks
Press our luck, flipping bucks out of state
Sensei, repping H-Town setting it straight

[Mike D]
I know niggaz out here, stay resenting me
Cause I'm known for pushing Jags, Benzes and Bentleys
Texas boss hogg, do the murder with no traces
My trigger finger anxious, to bust up niggaz braces
Mobbing with Lil' Duke, in a drop Deville
You in the Hun' with your main hoe, I'm 20 inch steel
Caps get peeled, niggaz best shield they grill
When I'm X'd out cocked up, gangsta leaning on three wheel
Play with ten on my pinky, with a igloo glowing
Even my main bitch hoeing, cause that puddy hole golden
Like K say where you been, (where you been)
Down in Texas it's a war, but with dope beats and pens
Run with Laf-Tex made men, Mobstyle afilliated
Clicked up with Dead End, now you motherfuckers hate it

[E.S.G.]
Welcome to Texas playboy, slang crack for fatter stacks
Population overflowing, from Mexican Cadillacs
Watch how bad we act, fat sacks of chronic smoke
Use words like thoed, 84's no hundred spokes
Looking for a joke, called Ced the Entertainer
Cedric Sosa's a soldier, Southside head banger
One in the chamber, cause the streets get hectic
E.S.G., the state representative for Texas</pre>
