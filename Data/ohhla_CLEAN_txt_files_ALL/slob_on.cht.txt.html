(La Chat)
Slob on my cat, get it nice and wet
Checking with me, holla at la chat
Fuck with yo girl, lick on my pearls
Suck about a nut, like you is a squirrel
Lay me on the bed, tongue between my legs
Uh you got me shaking, i grip you by yo head
You naughty, naughty boy, you good at this of course
The way you got me coming, you did this shit before
Now you wanna hit it, cause you took a lick
Look you dick hard, go holla at yo bitch
I met two niggas, said they wanna fuck
One ate my pussy, and the other lick my butt
Fucking with this dude, im fixing to let him hit
He got a fine body, with a little bitty dick
Little do he know, what I'm all about 
Call up my girls, his face on the house

Eat a bitch cat or some (chorus 4x)

I'm know to be a mack, straight up out the south
Looking for the boys, with golds in there mouth
Ridin niggas gold, is the shit I do 
If the shit is good, you do my whole crew
I'm never savin caut, put it on her mouth
Talking to her friend, yo face in her lap
When im on that weed, gotta have my knees
The motion of your tongue, make me curl my feet
Know a freaky dude, in west wood 
Like licking click, does it real good
He's the type of dude, down for that trickin
Never wanna fuck , just do the lickin
You could get me sprung, when the camp is fire
I'll burn you up , I ain't goin lie
Call my girls again, time to go out
Hit bill street, lookin for.....</pre>
