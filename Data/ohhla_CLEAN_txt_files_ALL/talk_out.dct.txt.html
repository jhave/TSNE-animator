Typed by: alcatrazz_iz_crazy_4_god@yahoo.com

T, jumpin' on the m-i-c to
Promote talk in the family
You, say parents don't understand
Yo, that's ill, I know they can
But, you're feelings they cannot read
And, communication is the key
See, this structure is under attack, jack
And all see it from white to black
We got problems like never before
That won't fade by lockin' your door
Or runnin' away, so hear what I say
Yo, talk is the only way

[Chorus]
Talk it out
Talk it out

Talk things out, begin to pray, ya'll
This unit is the only way
Created by god, the father of all
Who gave each entity a different call
Add it all together to build a team
One voice, one unit, a Christian theme
But this can't happen if ya shut the door
Block things out and begin to ignore
Verbal interaction is atop the list
The only antidote to slashing a wrist
Talk things out with the father above
Boy, communicate with the ones ya love

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You say you've got problems
Thinkin' they don't recognize
Let communication solve them
God will open up their eyes

[Break]
You gotta talk, talk it out
Cause dc talk is all about, well
This thing called a name
To ya family, it ain't no game
So just look, look to the hook
Of a song based on the good book, y'all
Of life, ya know what I'm sayin'
Dct and we ain't playin'

[Chorus] 2X

Talk it out
All you gotta do is talk it out
Talk it straight up with your family [4X]</pre>
