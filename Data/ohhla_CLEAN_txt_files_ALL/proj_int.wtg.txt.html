[Raekwon the Chef]
The Fuck?      
It's just the new way of thinkin
Light up the broccoli kid
Throw the relish in my back pocket
Keep your eyes open
Push your seat back, just flow...
That's how we doin it

Bound by honest sword take over the set; rap from here to Que-bec
Throw up the tech, crash your intellect select a vet
Swimsuit mammal handle, yo every fly vandal go to project
Slam you like Hamill's wife 'fore the scandal
Wally sandal just a sample, my niggaz fertilize thoughts
Yo mad support drink a quart then bamboo
When nasty can blew, my pen sterile won't perform if I'm not lampable
Askin my man'll get you slapped down; play the anthem
Lit it who wit it champagne get it, that's the ticket
Solid nines soundin like crickets snatchin worker shipment
Pull the air, long dick it, we talk right before we left lifted
Just like a long sleeve, guess who rip it?

[God] Projects
[Rae] My niggaz survive, just like a movin target
[God] Projects
[Rae] Where niggaz live and some sell garbage that's
[God] Projects
[Rae] Try to escape the flyin shells dodgin
[God] New York projects
[Rae] I'm livin large yo, stop miragin

[Method Man]
Sign of the times, conspiracy to overthrow the mind
Behind every fortune there's a crime
This technique is tech-9
Blast at any Close Encounter of the Third Kind
This be the evil that man do, we dismantle, any adversary
Them niggaz all thumbs and can't handle, my flurry
Hear me, you jam all you want to scare me
Don't even kid me, shit in my coke aimin at cha kidney 
Pressure, Red Hot like Chili Pepper
Black 'n Decker, hardware avoid the leper 
Five o'clock shadowboxer, hold down the sector 
Bet ya bottom dollar lecture, be hard to swallow 
Double oh-seven mark
The secret agent that Max/well and Get Smart, through entertainment
Welcome to The Killin Fields, with Johnny Dangerous 
Headbanger boogie niggaz goin thru changes

[God] Projects
[Rae] My niggaz survive, just like a movin target
[God] Projects
[Rae] Where niggaz live and some sell garbage that's
[God] Projects
[Rae] Try to escape the flyin shells dodgin
[God] Projects
[Rae] I'm livin large yo, stop miragin

[Ghostface Killah]
Suck my dick it's the kid with the fat knob
I bust all into ya face, plus it come in globs
Quick get on your knees, with yo' sweet pussy let it breathe
Two fingers is all in your hole, think I can fit three
Your pink lips, spread it in shit, let me throw my dick in
Grab my shit and place it gently, on your clit
Ping-pong pussy, wide world of wombs titty saggin
Stomach on some scriveled up prune shit
Too much air in your pussy you screamin that it's
TALKIN TO YOU DADDY, fart's breathin out your lips splashin my dick badly
Use vinegar, to try to tighten up your ginger
All-mighty dick, ran in with a cape, some call him engine
Lightning rod bob, black candy cane attatched to God
Thick, like a great adventure cigar, in your garage
Pregnant pussy have you fall out, like Remi on the house
Watch the teeth for slobbin my shit
You bit it on the couch, dry pussy leave the friction burns
Plus beef I hone, the condom broke
Bitch you got AIDS I'm shakin in my bones
