[Punch]
Check it, yo
My presence is, overshadowin, we spit different
Your album's like a bad stock tip, I lose interest
I'ma kinda nice, keep your distance
You beg to differ, that's sicker
Somethin my mindframe can't picture
For 'Pac I pour liquor, in peace may you rest
If only the best rappers die then I know that I'm next
Never impressed; lyrically, shittin on crews
I rhyme first, what makes you think they checkin for you?

[Cobra Red]
So you wanna battle?  Cobra gets vindictive, you ain't heard?
Stomp a nigga face out, watch his teeth make love to the curb
Can't say a word, he's layin there emotionless
His head similar to a grape, crushed from a wine press
Oh what a mess, don't stain the sheer Gucci dress
Curse me when (??) steps in your presence
You can't do nothin less, but respect the na-na
Known to chop you into pieces like chefs at Benihana, uhh!

[Planet Asia]
Yeah, uh-huh uh-huh, uh-huh; yo..
Rockin it raw, exactly who I'm rockin this for
I'm rockin this for, Lyricist Lounge, hip-hop and that's all
No stoppin there's more, droppin this so cop this in the stores
Heard they needed a interlude, so I just had to record
a couple of bars of punishment, to show y'all niggaz who's runnin shit
Songs of scorn, I squeeze a fist and crush buildings
and touch millions, man women plus children
Villains and such, "Life as it Is" the LP about to touch billions

[Guilty - Consequence &amp; Menace]
You don't wanna go bar for bar with these wild +Coyotes+
that'll turn the spot +Ugly+ if you out of line homey
  Cause y'all niggaz done had your time to shine, spittin your game
  Now that shit is gon' change dawg when Guilty bang
You need to really stop reachin like it's somethin top secret
when we all know that the only thing you pop is Pop Secret
  Yo the game is in me, these cats tried to bang it in me
  The way these fools actin they deservin an Emmy

[Phil Da Agony]
Uhh, yeah
Y'all should get your act together, and get motivated
My album highly anticipated, one of the greatest
A long drawn out victory
History with no mystery, it was so sick of me
to drop concepts, buildin up the reps
Ideas sparked the mind of my peers, get you in gear
Confident, in my confidant, ruler renaissance
Tour de France, drink liquor for launch
Carte blanche wherever I go, never repetitive flow
Platin more seeds and watchin 'em grow
Yo, yo.. {*fades out*}</pre>
