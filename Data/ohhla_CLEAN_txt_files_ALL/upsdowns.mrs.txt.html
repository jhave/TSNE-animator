[Chorus] [MURS]
I been up I been down
I've been high I've been low
I've been known to spit flows and rip shows to get doe
Get hoes and get laid and get paid for the spit
And in so many ways I'm amazed by this shit
It's a trip that I get all this fame and a check
When it's done show love for the game and respect
The effect that I have on the world as a whole
So absurd my control with these words from the soul

[Verse One] [MURS]
The greatest, underrated, off the coast of the Raiders
Most famous, yet crusadin' over shakin' off the haters
People said I made it cause I made it to a major 
But it's pretty small potatoes cause it's all the same paper
They all caught the vapors when I got my own tour goin'
You know how them fellas be, jealously sure showin'
Hey man I love it, it's my spot if they covet
Never hatin' on the haters, find a way to rise about it
I think nothin' of 'em
Tell 'em take it all and shove it
Fools smoother mo' shit than a Chicken McNugget
And when the chicks love it, it's a hit to the public
So I'm feelin' like, fuck it, they can take my dick and suck it
Until I kick the bucket I'ma be that motherfucker that 
Make it look so hard these other suckers never wanna rap
Or make it look so easy 
You know that it's meant to be
Welcome everybody to the 21st century

[Chorus]

[Verse Two] [MURS]
This isn't testimony
A lesson to the phony
Wait a second homie, I suggest you get to know me
I carry the crown, a new sheriff in town
Any beef that you found, I say we bury it now
From the streets not the sidewalk
A master of fly talk
It's not that you're wack, I'm just so cold that it's my fault
Responsible and comprable 
Unstoppable dope shit
Abominable, phenomenal, you're not so you're hopeless 
Penny with a hole in it
MC with his soul in it
And it shows when I compose the prose that has no limits
No gimmicks, just a straight up menace
Made a left off the Shaw and headed straight up Venice
I bang that Super-Cali-Frag-Alistic
Complicated composition
Killin' 'em with commentary
Crushin' all my competition
Ammunition for this war of attrition
You decide who the best I just made the decision

[Chorus]

[Verse Three] [Supreme]
(Supreme)
I'm tryin' to win
(The pains all)
So go in
I'm an immature imbecile, niggas so far from sensible
A missile shoots out my mind and lethally injures you
And hoes blow a nig cause my stick is a Dippy Do
We act very (very)
Please scratch Perry 
But fuck it
I'ma get drunk and eat black berry's
I can tell you're scared
Soft as wet Pinera bread and what?

Don't be so fearsome, this year I done
Busted they fuckin' eardrum
Your ear ring like ears pierced son
It's time to let the tears run
With knots swelling like water
I don't wanna hear your fears young
I'm posted up all over the globe and stay in distributors
Like where have I been
Off to myself like I'm so selfish

And all you niggas look like SNL skits
Don't shatter girl, just tackle girl (go long)
NFL in it
Cook for me, eat like a pig
And I go chill with my nigs
But we ain't chillin' we just buildin' to keep mad food in the fridge
