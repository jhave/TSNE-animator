Girl I wanna do you like a German Shepard
Take you home and get you hot and hot and get you butt naked
On the floor on the bed leg on the dresser
Bend you out and wear you out on my own record
Drop dat work, Take dat work, Throw dat work 
Do what you do show dat work
I want dat cushion da pushing that got me looking
Bet you if I get wit you I hit the bottom of the bushes
So don't call me them other suckers trying to play me like that
Cause I'll give you them couple dollars let my partner bite that
And if you wana do it again with somebody else then I'll be right back
And when we do it don't worry it's gone be somewhere where it's nice at

Ooh baby like it when you jiggle and wobble
Walking it like a model while you popping your bottle
