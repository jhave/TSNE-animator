Song:   I'm Your Enemy
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[King Lil G]
I'm not your friend, I'm your enemy
Bullet holes to those, pretendin' to be friends with me
I think your girls kinda feelin', i hit it on the first day
She said we had chemistry
I'm the type to start a fight for publicity, i said fuck Lil Rob
Know everybody's listening, the true is, i don't have beef with em
I'm feeling the way he spittin' that orale rhyme
Firme..hynas, innocent people getting killed in drive-bys
Stories bout the streets everytime i rhyme
Real mexican hip hops about time
Ima bring it to you dawg, god forgive me if I'm wrong
Fucken bitches with no condoms on
I'm annexed the way I'm steallin' the throne
I bet they saying, that I'm selling my soul, illuminati

[Chorus]

[Big Swiisha]
From the streets where we get that, flip that work
We don't split that work, mob around with g's on my side
Hoes in my ride, talk your shit but your shit don't hurt me
Ho we getting money, ain't shit funny so fuck what you talking about

[King Lil G]
I'm the motherfuckin' true, executing rappers
In the microphone booth, who gives a fuck
If Capone-E is a pakistan, you needa realize he helped alotta mexicans
Respect i don't care about his rap skills, I'm paying homage
I'm just keeping it mad real, he paved the way for the future
Lil G King Enemy i salute ya
I'm the voice of the immigrants, voice of the innocent, independent mexicans
Lil G, Money Boy, Big Swiisha, Young Dopey we still riding with ya
My teams getting strong, hit the weed from the bong, kush smoke in the west coast
I had a dream about last night, double nine Big Downer and the fast life

[Chorus]

[Big Swiisha]
From the streets where we get that, flip that work
We don't split that work, mob around with g's on my side
Hoes in my ride, talk your shit but your shit don't hurt me
Ho we getting money, ain't shit funny so fuck what you talking about</pre>
