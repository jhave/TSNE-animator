Now hear dis!
All bad man what dey a know
The original bad man dey a know, seen?
Daddy Nitro, an' Ice-T dey 'pon ? man
Come talk wit reality
An' any guy who nah like dey got shot in ? face
No Ice-T, come talk wit reality star
Tell dem bout da endin of da world today.. COME!

[Ice-T]
I got a attitude as thick as a convict's
Bomb ticks, my heart beats as I rhyme over hard shit
Watch this, the nigga that you didn't think could do
break through with the rhythm that'll rock your whole crew
Thought you knew; I ain't no punk or no pooh-butt
Step to me, the cops are still diggin niggaz up
What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  You wanna try your luck
You move you weave you bob you got stuck
And now you're trippin with your fuckin brain
You never seen so much blood pour through one vein
You try to scream, you choke
You try to run, your legs are broke
You're bulletproof I hope..
Yo, I ain't no nigga to flex, but I will flip
Fuck up a nigga and dropkick his fuckin bitch
I love to squabble and I'm good widdit
So if you want some nigga come get it
I ain't trippin nigga trippin at all
Yo, I'm fuckin walkin over weak rapper's downfalls
It ain't my fault they fell, it ain't my fault I sell
I pull my ass up from the depths of hell

[Daddy Nitro]
Lawd!  Jib-bibbidy-bong, jib-bibbidy-be-bong-ska-dang
Daddy Nitro an' Ice-T come wid a different some-thang
Comin out de ghetto tings are wild like pure 'ell
Nuff man get ? in my firebomb sale
Some a sell coke but the music we a sell
We no inna doubt, we don't want no ambulance bell
While other lyrics are full of our style we fill up our clientele
Ice-T an' Nitro from the, depths of 'ell, COME!

[Ice-T]
You punks are jealous cause I'm rollin in fly shit
My shit, all paid for and I don't owe no guy shit
Fuck you, it ain't my fault your ass is on empty
Thought you was it, but you're smooth gettin pimped G..
.. I ain't no hoe fool
Got much respect for the new and the old school
But many rappers can rip mics but can't count..
.. zero bank amounts
Word and many critics are hot cause hard rap hits
They like to make it all soft that we pop shit
Fuck that, I'll die before I let the hardcore go
Cause I'm a nigga from the G-H-E-T-T-O
I got a posse who's airtight, quick to fight
And got the power to continue or end the night
And if you stepped on wrong, then you're a done kid
The yellow tape's in the club because one did
I got no pity so don't ask me for fuckin any
I'll break a bum off but you niggaz can't get a penny
When I was broke, I stole my gold, I pawned
I lived the life of a hustler off and on
I'm just a brother that lived to tell
I brought my ass up from the depths of hell

[Daddy Nitro]
Come!  In a de ghetto tings are wild round de clock
Some man a smoke crack and soem man a fire shot
Me tell de people dem laws, that we no inna dat
If a guy try dat thing we get them sixteen shotta
It's a lovely night ?? ?? off de chatta
Easy Ice-T make them no say you a mark-a
Anyway we go on I bet a no say we stop
wit lyrics and de music and right on de ?
EASE UP and come again my selector
All over de world is only for pain an' sufferin
That's why Ice-T and Daddy Nitro come wit the reality thing
Nice this everytime star
Man like Ice-T 'pon the ?? man
Come in star, one last time and teach dem bout reality
Now watch dis, COME!

[Ice-T]
I met this girl who act like I owed her somethin
Nothin, all I owed her was some good steady fuckin
Fuck that, not the one that's gonna fall on no hoe trap
Ease back bitch, before you need all your teeth back..
.. I ain't no fuckin mark
Made all my money workin bowcutters in the dark
Snatch bars and cars and vice grips
Long handled sledgehammers, saws and wire snips
I got an ill side that drips from my brain at times
It still thinks of the psycho and brutal crimes
I still remember when I had a low cash flow
No hoes, no cars, no gear no dough
And times got wicked..
.. I even remember havin to sell all my pawn tickets
But suckers spread out and they left me with few friends
But that's who wit me as we fuck up the true ends
So don't be trippin if your luck's gone bad, be glad
It'll empty out the fake fuckin friends you had
Then get yourself together, nigga aim straight
Shoot point blank at your goals, work hard and wait
You can do it even if you fell
I brought my ass back from the depths of hell

[Daddy Nitro]
Cause we are serious, en-ter-tain-ers
Talk about de Ice-T, he no joker
Cause we are serious, en-ter-tain-ers
Talk about de Daddy Nitro me no joker
Me come and pull up my lyrics and full up my style
