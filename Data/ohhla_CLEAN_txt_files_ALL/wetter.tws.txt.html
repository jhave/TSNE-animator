[Intro: Erika Shevon]
I'm calling you daddy, daddy
Can you be my daddy? Daddy
I need a daddy, daddy
Won't you be my daddy? Daddy
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee

[Twista]
Now, now, now come and kick it with the Twista
Black Caddy, mack daddy with a hoe up in the backseat
With a '97 +Pimp+ flow, got a feelin 
when you smokin when I flip it to a Trax beat
Talkin about a beautiful figure, astonishing as Greek mythology 
Body be just like the girl in uhh, what's that movie?
Never mind, let me enter yo' atmosphere 
as you enter my world and let me touch that booty
I can't believe that yo' momma that cold
Her daughter got such an astonishing soul, you need a modelin role
Still a playa know you got it when you climbin 
from the bottom to the top of the pole, cause you can pop in control
Yo' phatty's so accurate when I'm smackin it
it's makin me say "What I gotta do to get with that?"
When it come to makin it rain I can get it wet
When it come to cuttin that monkey I can get it wet
You want some media baby you need a better man
He cover politics, I'ma be yo' weatherman
Cause every time I'm lookin up and I see more ass
I'ma constantly see rain in the forecast
This-a-way, that-a-way, I'm flickin +5000 Ones+ 
or whatever you wanna call it
It's a celebration, you the champion, here's the fetti confetti
C'mon and get drunk with the money hauler

[Chorus 2X: Erika Shevon]
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee

[Twista]
But when I'm not for the feminine (feminine)
and everybody that proceed with the hatred I'ma teach 'em a lesson
I take shots of adrenaline (adrenaline)
cause that's the way I receive immunization against the recession
I got the muscle off of my hustle-and-flow money
A entrepreneur with ways to get mo' money
So don't be trippin whenever you see me throw money
Huh, it's just a lil' bit of show money
But if you want me to get it wet in other ways 
then I'ma have to beat it up but first I'ma play wit'chu girl
Touch your ears and your neck and play wit'cha pearls 
then I reach up in your pants and play wit'cha pearl
When I lay you down you ain't gotta be frontin and fakin on me baby 
cause I know it take the right touch
I ain't stoppin 'til you wet up the covers 
because I gotta keep on fuckin 'til I see a lot of white stuff
Now you got me excited, I can't hold it
I'm feelin it comin, I'm 'bout to let off an explosion (ohh)
Let it ride when I see you animated and shakin 
now when I touch your body you catchin convulsions (uh-huh)
That's when I know I'm doin what I'm supposed to
You chose me, I chose you
Don't think I can get it wet? I told you
Come and let the Twist rain down on you

[Chorus]

[Outro: Erika Shevon]
I'm calling you daddy, daddy
Can you be my daddy? Daddy
I need a daddy, daddy
Won't you be my daddy? Daddy
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee</pre>
