(Verse 1)
From the fifth floor I schedule my meeting with the moon
Stress, let it go so it don't completely consume
When the vegetables bite back, and the grass starts to sting
I yell up to heaven to get me the hell out of this dream
I fell out of my stream of self-consciousness
And I got welts on my mind to signify all my accomplishments
No matter whose math you use to count the dead
Progress will never rest, in the hand that has no head
Brought my brain a cane and asked it to be my pimp
You know, to make sure I don't get stuck up in my fuck ups
A little overanxious I was, to bust nuts
And find the answers making love
Out of a canvas full of touch-ups
I dip my brush into what I've wept for
And wonder out loud as I can, how long I've slept for
I should rob a pet store, let the dogs wild
I should close all the schools just to make the kids smile
Sieze the limit, let the sky be the moment
Put the key to the ignition, I'ma ride these donuts
And when it breaks, lock the door, walk away
Won't be nothin else to talk about, nothin else to say

(Hook x4)
I'm just waiting for the moment I can break away
The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day

See I'm just waiting for the moment, I can break away
The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day
I'm just waitin for the moment, I can break away..

(Verse 2)
Let's stand on the corner, throw rocks at people
So there's no surprises, written off as evil
I sleep next to women that I don't deserve
They like to hurt my pride, while I work their nerves
Once upon a time, it was worth it,
When the urges get fed,
And the purpose finds a path to the surface
Is respect considered a breakfast food?
I'm guilty of the type of attitude that wrecks your mood
The truth can be pain, and I hate to do it
Either face the music, or get away from me stupid
Super glue it down, now it better not move
See I'm not the best, but I'm in the top two
And I'm not that friendly, when this cup is empty
It's a side effect from trying to find the fucks that sent me
See I didn't just happen, I was made this way
By the same egomaniac that came this way

(Hook)
See I'm just waiting for the moment, I can break away
The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day
I'm just waitin for the moment, I can break away
The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day

(Verse 3)
See I gave up lying, but I still tiptoe
I'm as stubborn as they come, and I'm known to hit low
If I had a chisel, I would carve out a hole
For me to hide in everytime the mighty wind blows
Since no one knows, where the hell we gonna go
I'm gonna stand right here, until the end of the show
I'm gonna clap my hands, so don't pass the chance,
To unsnap my pants, get on my lap and dance
No longer am I mad about the things I don't have
All I'm living for is love and laughs
The last starfighter's weapons were rendered useless
So we pulled the scissors and cut the cord to end this music..
music (fades out) (fades in and out again)

(Ending)
You want the fucking window rolled up,
You roll up the fucking window you piece of shit!
Don't fucking talk to me like that,
Don't fucking talk to me at all!
You act so fucking ugly!</pre>
