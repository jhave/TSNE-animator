[Baby talking]
Hey Fresh!
We back at it baby

[Chorus: Manny Fresh]
Here baby doll, up against the wall
And through the sound, he broke it down
Only one more Hypnotic, and that's when he shot it
I'm not lookin' for love, up in the club
But I wanna go home with you, girl

[Verse 1]
(Manny Fresh)
I'm not your man I'm a pimp, baby please understand
But you hot, and they not, so we can hold hands
In a long truck, Cadillac
Surround sound, front to back
"Forever?  Forever, ever?"
Forever, ever black
Ridin' in the sunshine, crankin' up the Alpine
Rubbin' down shorty's spine, she is fine!
Love 'um, leave 'um, go back and retrieve 'um
If their hair is bad, then I will weave 'um

(Baby)
Kick back in the Phantom, two clips and a hammer
Cruisin' through the hood on them Deion Sanders
Nothin' but red whips and all them candy
Two chicks, two chickens that flew from Atlanta, aye
Laid back in a Maebach, countin' stacks
Got work, go to work, nigga count that
Summer shine, summer time, and we on the grind
Birdman got them chickens and they ain't flyin'

[Chorus: Manny Fresh]
Here baby doll, up against the wall
And through the sound, he broke it down
Only one more Hypnotic, and that's when he shot it
I'm not lookin' for love, up in the club
But I wanna go home with you, girl

[Verse 2]
(Manny Fresh)
I'm cool, I'm hip, I'm fresh, I'm good
I'm diamonds up against the wood, richest nigga from the hood
Four amplifiers, four 24 tires
Fuck professional liars, fo' show enter our fire
In a big black Chevy, starch real heavy
Peanut butter reclinin', with the Steve Harvey line in
Look at me!

(Baby)
Let me slide and ride and get inside
And take you to my hood where it's do or die
Where the whips is clean, we hustle for nickels and dimes
Chips, green, the liquior was hard as a crime
Custom machine and 'dro be on my mind
Lace my team with life and bricks for dimes
Ghetto soldier and you can't stop my shine
Fresh, Stunna, bitch respect my mind

[Chorus: Manny Fresh]
Here baby doll, up against the wall
And through the sound, he broke it down
Only one more Hypnotic, and that's when he shot it
I'm not lookin' for love, up in the club
But I wanna go home with you, girl

[Verse 3]
(Manny Fresh)
Sean Paul on the wall, break it down, do it girl
Lift it up, let it flow, shake it fast, there it go
Make it wobble, make it jiggle, put the pickle in the middle
Push it back, make it clap, in and out, that's a wrap
Good bye, so long, I got to go, I'm goin' home
But you my favorite friend, let's bump and grind next weekend

(Baby)
See you fuckin' with your boy, remember who gunna ride?
When trouble hit the hood nigga, who gunna die?
When shit get ugly nigga, who gunna fly?
But when shit get bubbly everybody wanna ride me
Benz, Lexus, the coupe, the jets
Nigga holla at the boy, baby pimpin' the flesh
Like in Stalled Evoy, third world is the set
I'm a worldwide shiner bitch, I drove the best

[Chorus: Manny Fresh (2X)]
Here baby doll, up against the wall
And through the sound, he broke it down
Only one more Hypnotic, and that's when he shot it
I'm not lookin' for love, up in the club
But I wanna go home with you, girl</pre>
