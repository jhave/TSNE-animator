[Chorus: Pumpkinhead]
These are my favorite songs of all time
So I flipped the titles and put 'em in a rhyme (rhyme)
I made this song for you to rock
So put four quarters in the jukebox
These are my favorite songs of all time
So I flipped the titles and put 'em in a rhyme (rhyme)
I made this song for you to rock
So put four quarters in the jukebox, jukebox

[Pumpkinhead]
Since Dana Dane's "Nightmares," I knew you were the one
The way you spoke to me through "The Sample and the Drum"
Good Lord, "The Message" you sent to the young world
opened my eyes then my destiny unfurled
It was "Me, Myself and I," chillin with a buddy
A "Microphone Fiend" who never thought about the money
In the "Summertime," everybody was listenin
when the cars drove by with the boomin system
I needed an "Around the Way Girl" who wasn't a slut
I picked Gina, cause she had a "Big Ol' Butt"
She and I got closer with every kiss, and each hug
But she left and gave me "The Gas Face" cause I had peach fuzz
At home base, we were "Steppin to the A.M."
'Til the "Stick-Up Kids" pulled out weapons and started sprayin
We pushed it along, and went to get some gumbo
But "I Left My Wallet in El Segundo"

[Chorus]

[Pumpkinhead]
A lot of heads out there, be "Fakin' the Funk"
So they better hit the deck, when I pop the trunk
At halftime, that's "When the Fat Lady Sings"
It's a friendly game of baseball when this "New Jack Swings"
I "Party and Bullshit," on tour in each town
But if punks jump up, they'll get beat down
And you could throw your guns, but make sure they don't "Jam"
Slow down, before you get "Slam"'ed
The "Scenario" is this, never come wack
In showbiz, I want my pockets fat not flat
My ex was a mentirosa, she always liked to lie
She kept on "Passin' Me By," for those other guys
I "Know-the-Ledge," but she didn't "Understand"
I could get psycho, and +just kill a man+
"Tonight's the Night," "Miuzi Weighs a Ton" under my pea coat
I'm "Poppa Large," big shotter than East coast

[Chorus]

[Pumpkinhead]
I compose symphonies, only when I'm drunk
And "Reminisce" on the times when homies would never front
Swingin ep's in the "Back of the Jeep" with chick girl chillin
Just ask her, her "Pink Cookies Got Crushed by a Building"
But after that, I fronted like I never knew her
Cause her "Juicy" ass smelled like it was straight from the sewer
"I Get Around" like a ferris wheel
And come cleaner than a new pistol, to get "Mass Appeal"
I'm from "Bucktown"; don't try to take the throne
Cause it's "Operations Locked Down"
Sippin "Gin &amp; Juice," and "Today Was a Good Day"
I got a bag of "Blue Funk" and I'm smokin it with "Camay"
On my front stoop, kickin "Flava in the Ear"
I'm "Sittin on Chrome" so you got nothin to fear
Everything's "La Schmoove," I bag the "Tenderoni"
Now all I wanna know is "Where My Homiez?"

[Chorus]
