Yo.. and this is No Limit records
I am Snoop D-O motherfuckin double G
Partyin with my ??? Silkk The Shocker
You a made man now nigga
Yeah

[Silkk The Shocker]
Year round party
Yall get em up, get it up
What up Snoop?

[Snoop Dogg]
Wake up, jump out of bed and get dressed
My life is a mess, naah better yet it's a test
I snatched the chopper from the coppers then put on my vest
Life's a baseball game out west
Oh yes, you rockin with the best, the S
N double O-P, your grandmama know me
So for all my homegirls and all my homies
Ain't no limit picnic and it's on me
Our world is G so roll with me
And Silkk The Shocker and grab some gin for this vodka
Got summertime rockin for your jeeps and trucks
Big June Bug in the house, what up
Got a jar full of dope and a box of blunts
Hoes in the house, if you see em turn em out
Bitches walkin by sayin hi to me
And niggas givin dat cause they ride with me

[Snoop Dogg/(Silkk The Shocker)]
We goin throw a party so my homies come and chill 
(give it up, get it up)
All the hoes invited so you know we goin get ill 
(give it up, get it up)
We goin throw a party so ladies come and chill 
(give it up, get it up)
All my dogs invited so we gotta keep it real

[Silkk The Shocker]
Yo yo yo
It ain't nothin but a N-O L-I-M-I to the T
Party, so all my dogs could ride with me
Hopped out the drop, the drivers side of course
You seen me somewhere before, you did, 
probably was in the Vibe or the Source
You know what I do when it's time to floss
I'm a do it, you know I ain't got time to talk
But I see somethin in the corner and she lookin kinda fly
I tell my dog Snoop (psst psst) 
man you might as well go ahead and stop me
(Lemme holla at you dog) She done met up with a star, eye contact
I nodded, she nodded back, then we met up at the bar
I told her I keep ice on my wrist, tight keep ice on my chin
And I'll still respect you tommorow, and tonight I hit it
But you only got a couple minutes to choose
And my time is like dollars so I only got a couple minutes to lose
In a minute I'm a hop in my ride, if you in this cool
If not ya gotta make a decision by the time I finish my food
Now what

[Snoop Dogg/(Silkk The Shocker)]
We goin throw a barbecue so niggas light the grill 
(give it up, get it up)
All my dogs invited so you know we goin get ill 
(give it up, get it up)
We goin throw a barbecue so ladies light the grill 
(give it up, get it up)
All my dogs invited so you got to keep it real

[Silkk The Shocker/(Snoop Dogg)]
Now I used to be on the block, 
now I'm in the drop chillin with Snoop
But I walk through the door I feel animosity (oh you feelin it too)
Probably cause we say our name we could be stealin they booth
Probably cause I'm platinum, we dark, could be chillin at two
(The south west connect, big chains on our neck
Boy give us respect, yall shit on deck)
Aight Snoop, you got the weed (yeah) and I got the liquor (fa sho)
Meach got the food but who got the strippers (I dont know)
Cause ain't no party like the ones we drove (whassup)
And um, ain't no cars like the ones we drove 
And um, ain't no dollars like the ones we fold
When we give somethin, call us, it's outta control
(So whether it's summertime, winter, spring or fall
Look for somethin big from Silkk and Top Dogg)
We party with nothin but bud, nothin but thugs
East to west, peep the best, keep it stress, nothin but love (yeah)
Fuck
