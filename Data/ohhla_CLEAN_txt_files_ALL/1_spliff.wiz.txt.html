Song:   One Spliff
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

California grapes, I'm breaking fine wines
Me I'm sky high, my bitch down to earth
Money in the bank, weed roller in her purse
And I ain't slackin on the job, my dog I been alert
Been gettin cake, bank being the verb
Big numbers on the net so niggas show love
And the diamonds on my neck should make these hoes trust
On the road, at the venue filled with model hoes
College shows, smokin grade a honor roll
Bad broad, light skin, hood niggas, white friends
And I ain't gotta talk much, it's in your face
Give me brain, cause she say she got expensive taste!
Let her rub my tattoos, now she flyin
Smokin zig zags too, nigga rap like crack so I

[Chorus]
One spliff, keep the..
One spliff, keep the..
One spliff, keep the..

Turn out my BB and my HTC
Please don't interrupt me when I'm smoking THC
I'm out to prove, what I'm about to do with this ounce of food
First class flight higher attitude
Lead astray by the astray
I am half baked..
If ain't a smoking sign I'm a eat my hash cake
Only with my back up, I'm out to get paid
And I roll my spliffs backwards, the amsetrdam way
Hey, hey!
... health problems, forget it!
I will give you two drows, you will turn schizophrenic
This smell of your police, pull us over for the hell of it
But fine often, cause we smoked out for the evidence

[Chorus]
One spliff, keep the..
One spliff, keep the..
One spliff, keep the..

In hell, excel, on smoke..
There was big on... then I used to roll spillfs
Get the whole sip, now I'm in the days
On the... 'till I drift away
I'll be on it, on it all night
Yeah, that's super strong
Down to the last..
I don't know, should I roll, should I..
Make the town red like the souls on the..
High upon it, home grown
We're playing chronic, this is a smoke zone
Rolling flower power joints..
If I'm like this, I'm fucking up the whole zone
I smoke that... is legit
Just a hit make you... like smoking on friday
Live your life, that's what I say
... while we speed, that's the highway!

[Chorus]
One spliff, keep the..
One spliff, keep the..
One spliff, keep the..

Let's go!..
You can smell it through my pocket
It ain't tricking if you got it, feel like I breath
Anybody feel like rolling up a... of cush?
I would, but she got me sleeping, feeling good
Sick of position but it's different..
That's me feeling like a real nigger should
I'm a do this..
Real players do whatever that they want here..
Moving quicker than jamaicans in the fast lane
I'm babysitting, don't forget to..
Beak it down, roll it up
Calliko, wiz khalifa, roll up in there!

[Chorus]
One spliff, keep the..
One spliff, keep the..
One spliff, keep the..</pre>
