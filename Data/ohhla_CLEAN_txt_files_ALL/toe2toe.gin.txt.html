Yeah, on my time off 
I seen alot of people tryin' to be like me 
Timbaland, I know you have, knowumsayin'? 
But we gon' hit 'em like this 
Check it out 

Chorus:
None of y'all wanna go against me
Ya trip me out tryin to orbit me 
But this go 'round I'ma show you once 
Said that you don't got what it take 

None of y'all wanna go toe to toe 
Face to face, head to head, blow for blow 
And this go 'round I'ma show you once 
Said that you don't got what it takes 

2nd Verse:
Listen.. 
What's mines is mines and yours is yours 
You were violated when you walked through the door 
Can't nobody see Ginuwine and the Fam' 
Stepped up in the business and we changed all your plans 
Entertained our people, gave 100 damn percent 
Never dream how much that all of us would get bent 

To all of those who want it won't you just quit it 
You ain't seen a thing until you all have come wit it 
No need to trick nigga, take your pick 
Cuz on this CD every song's a hit 
My whole damn crew, can't a soul get wit 
So don't even hate cuz you can't touch it 

Chorus

2nd Verse:
I'ma get respect one way or the other 
Even if I take it, I'ma make you wanna 
Go get your crew but they can't help you 
Now it's you and I, and you know you're through 
I'm gonna nod who ever think they can 
Get wit Ginuwine and Timbaland 
Step to the plate ya take your swing 
Now it's my turn watch me do my thing
