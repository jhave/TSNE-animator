[Diamond]
Step up, step up and catch a bad one...

[Sadat X]
A lot of kids is wondering, or hoping that I fell
You are here to talk and I'm here to fucking walk
Let me ask a little something, I let my track record float
Niggas want to play me, and say I go broke
But dig it, the way I figure it's one less man
It's more cash in my hand

[Lord Jamar]
Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  Give it here, baby
You know what I'm saying, mo' money, mo' motherfucking money

[Sadat X]
Well uh King's bridge, do you got a man?
I'm asking you the question, don't try to front
Cause if he's asking for a present he can get one
I won't hesitate, rather be first than late
Hoe there's your man now, yo he'd better chill
See I had to lick him, why'd I do it?
Shit you knew it, money fucked around and blew it
John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec
Do I get respect on the mic, wreck
My name is X of the Nubian breed
Got one seed but I don't chill, let the wax proceed

	Step up, step up and catch a bad one
	Punks jump up to get beat down!  (Repeat 2x)

[Diamond]
Well it's the kid boy wonder, straight from the under
Ground with the Nubians, so engineer cue me and I wreck shit
Pick up the loot and it's on to the next skit
Beat down a punk and I'm out through the exit
So baby get into a thing
Cause Diamond is dope, there's no need to mope
I make jams that slam but I'm not souped up
If I'm not with a stunt then I'm home couped up
Making hits from pieces and bits
Niggas still talk shit, but I pop 'em like a zit
Straight from the Bronx with the kids from the Now Rule
Together on the joint was a definite power move
Yeah, so yo kid feel the funk
Diamond is out and beating down all punks
So step up, if you want to keep your rep up
I don't have to smoke a blunt to get pepped up

	Punks jump up to get beat down!  
	Step up, step up and catch a bad one (Repeat 2x)

[Lord Jamar]
Well punk motherfuckers try to flex on the G-O-D
But like I said yo the Gods must be crazy
So it don't phase me or my gat
Just put up your thangs and then we start to slang joints
Scoring points like a Genesis
Everybody down with my crew are fucking menaces
To society, cause society failed to embrace the black male variety
So that's why we're so damn hostile
Beat a motherfucker down like he was a stepchild
Break him up in the ribs with the knuckles of brass
Take off my belt and then I buckle your ass
You say you've never ran but we'll have you running fast
Lord Jamal is quick to blast when

	Punks jump up to get beat down!  
	Step up, step up and catch a bad one (Repeat 2x)</pre>
