[Justin Bieber]
Oh woooah, oh woooooah, oh wooooah, oh
You know you love me, I know you care
you shout whenever and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
and we will never ever ever be apart
Are we an item? girl quit playing
we're just friends, what are you saying
Said there's another, look right in my eyes
my first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like...

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oooooh
like baby, baby, baby noooooooo
like baby, baby, baby, ooooh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine (repeat)

[Justin Beiber]
Oh, for you I would have done whatever
and I just can't believe we aint together
and I wanna play it cool the thought of losing you
I buy you anything, I buy you any ring
and now please say baby fix me and you shake me til' you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down down down down
and I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like...

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Luda, When I was 13 I had my first love
there was nobody that compared to my baby
and nobody came between us, no-one could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh I was star-struck
she woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, I skip a beat when I see her in the street and
at school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing coz she was so amazing
and now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

[Chorus]

Now I'm gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
now I'm all gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, I'm gone</pre>
