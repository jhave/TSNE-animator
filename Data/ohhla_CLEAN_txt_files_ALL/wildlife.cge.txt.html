Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Shit is criminal I'm sick in what I write about
To make an overdose work you need the right amount
Taking yourself off the planet would probably help
But you can shift the focus from you to somebody else
Knowing I was deranged and had to pick a route
The kid didn't chicken out, not fit inside, sticking out
Use a gun or a knife or grip a rope in anger
You into gore [?] you probably wouldn't want to be a strangler
Wildlife awaits and I can be in danger
Open the door with a M4 like a ranger
They want to clap at me but it is not applause
I don't follow Gods, why would I follow laws?

Doesn't matter what you see you can flee
You can go off of the grid you could translate it to be
Couldn't let it go so you dug your own ditch
Now they're gonna get you when you're all alone bitch
Doesn't matter what you see you can flee
You can go off of the grid you could translate it to be
Couldn't let it go so you dug your own ditch
They're gonna put you in it when you're all alone bitch

Let the animal out I waited so patiently
And all it did was just created complacency
Just started now they want to put an end to me
It's why I put a mask on to shield my identity
Got a lot of guns, fed by a lot of gall
A lot of ammo, empathy, not at all
It's a friend to me or an evil entity
Talking to me, who am I to argue with divinity?

Doesn't matter what you see you can flee
You can go off of the grid you could translate it to be
Couldn't let it go so you dug your own ditch
Now they're gonna put you in it all alone bitch
Doesn't matter what you see you can flee
You can go off of the grid you could translate it to be
Couldn't let it go so you dug your own ditch
They're gonna put you in it all alone bitch

If it doesn't bleed it won't feed the impulse
If I can't leave then I won't even be in [?]
If I don't relate I will just slip away
Die, rise, turn into a ghost until I pick a day
When I reemerge plus fully modded
Twisted, every weapon and a head full of dilaudid
Separate every dream from it's living thing
Let them pile up, they don't fly when you give them wings

Doesn't matter what you see you can flee
You can go off of the grid you could translate it to be
Couldn't let it go so you dug your own ditch
Now they're gonna get you when you're all alone bitch
Doesn't matter what you see you can flee
You can go off of the grid you could translate it to be
Couldn't let it go so you dug your own ditch
And they're gonna put you in it all alone bitch</pre>
