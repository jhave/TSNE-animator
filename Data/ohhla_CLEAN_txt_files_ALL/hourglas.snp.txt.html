Awww yeah
This one goes out to all you muthafuckers out there
That didn't think we could make records that could bang in the club
Ya that's right
All you ladies out there with the big butts
with the long hair, the big titties, the pretty eyes
Report to the dance floor right about now

[Snoop Dogg]
Wiggle it round c'mon down
Doggy-d-o-double's in town
I know you wanna get down
So why you lookin' at me like that
Bitch break that shit down
I wanna make your kitty cat growl
I wanna hit it get it right now
So what you playin' with it for
Back it up slow move it around and dance to the flow
Now put your hands on the floor (c'mon)
C'mon on and gimme some more
It's crazy but baby that maybe we gonna fuck in a man's mercedes
Bitch I ain't that loco
Fuckin' with a broke hoe
Get a nigga smoked tho, no-no, na-na, nae-nae
She got a whole bunch of kids like baby
Listen what the pimper say

[Goldie Loc]
I want you to be what I want you to be
You can hump with me that's what I want you to be
I want you to be what I want you to be
You can hump with me that's what I want you to be

[Mr. Kane]
I slap bitches in the face and give em Jay-Z lips
Make them sign their life off so they can pay me chips
I cut hoes so much I should sell band aids
Give bitches sandwiches with handmade mayonnaise
I put bitches on the stroll hall
Plus I control hoes like remote control suped remote controlled cars
Code blow hoe on 'em like the internet
Got my dick in her neck and ain't even took her to dinner yet
Fuck that I ain't taken her to dinner
I'll bring her to a diner get behind and go up in her
You fuckin' with losers
I'm a winner I'm gone in summer hot in the winter
Fuck hungry I'm ready for dinner HA!
Bitches don't know the low
'Bout to slap your ass off the endo smoke
I'm in the club straight goin' for broke
Sellin' bitches everything even low key dope

[Goldie Loc]
Don't you wanna get nasty
I like it when you freak that ass
36-24-36 shaped like an hourglass
????
Let me rub up on that clit it feels so nice and soft

[Snoop Dogg]
Coast to coast we do-si-dos
And get your day started like a breakfast toast
Me and my niggas make beats for your strokes
Heat for your tokes, baby tees for your chokes, keys for your ?
Me squeezin' your folks
When they come through
With their noses flarin' out like they be on that coke
Nah we on that dope
Now she wanna go cause she wanna know
How did we walk through the front door
Your pants down straight VIP
Well when it comes to rap styles, and rap crowns, and mack downs
Just mingle, we straight smack down
We so OG this here gonna be
If you with it you can have a little hit off me
Get nasty, get freaky, get busy o-so-off the hizzy</pre>
