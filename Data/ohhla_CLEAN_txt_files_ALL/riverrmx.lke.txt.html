[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah
Supposed to have a remix
That's how you make
One hit record, and then two
Haha, 50 Cent
G G G G G-Unit
I remember when you used to love me
You used to kiss and hug me
I look into your eyes and get lost for a day
You love me is what you told me
All the time I let you hold me
How I in fear you slippin' away

[Verse 1: Justin]
You were my sun, you were my earth (Uh huh)
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no (G G G G G-Unit)
So you took a chance, and made other plans (Yeah)
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no (C'mon)

[Hook 1: Justin]
You don't have to say, what you did
I already know, I found out from, him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me, there'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?

[Hook 2: Justin]
You told me you love me (Whoo)
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone (Uh huh, Uh huh)
Girl I refuse
You must have me confused with some other guy (Yeah)
The bridges were burned
Now its your turn, to cry

[Chorus: Justin]
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Yeah, yeah (Ahhh)

[Verse 2: Justin]
You know that they say somethings are better left unsaid (Uh huh)
It wasn't like you only talked to him
And you know it, Don't act like you don't know it (Yeah)
All of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head (Messin' with my mead)
Should of picked honesty
Then you may not have thought it
Yeah (whoo)

[Hook 1: Justin]
You don't have to say, what you did
I already know, I found out from, him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me, there'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it? (Uh huh)

[Hook 2: Justin]
You told me you love me (Whoo)
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone (Uh huh, yeah)
Girl I refuse
You must have me confused with some other guy (you must got confused)
The bridges were burned
Now its your turn, to cry

[Chorus: Justin]
So cry me a river (Uh huh)
Cry me a river (C'mon)
Cry me a river (Baby go on and just)
Cry me a river
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
50 Cent
If you know what I know, you know
You ain't gotta say a word
It's done in the dark, comes to light, I'm flippin' kick it to curb
Your smile all up in my face, girl you gotta a lot of nerve
Situation so absurd
You ain't special, you's a bird (Whoo)
Get yo' shit and hit the do'
You ain't welcome here no mo'
Ain't no sense in your cry
Girl you know I know you lie
You must take me for a fool
Thinkin' I'ma stay with you
First gimme back my jewels
Bitch I ain't playin' with you

[Hook 1: Justin]
You don't have to say, what you did
I already know, I found out from, him (Whoo)
Now there's just no chance (Uh huh)
With you and me, there'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it? (C'mon)

[Chorus: Justin]
Cry me a river (Go on and just)
Cry me a river (Baby go on and just)
Cry me a river (You can go on and just)
Cry me a river
Yeah, yeah
Cry me a river (Yeah) (Baby go and just)
Cry me a river (Go on and just) (Oh)
Cry me a river (Already cried) (Haha)
Cry me a river (I don't wanna cry no more) (Yeah)

[Outro: Justin &amp; 50 Cent]
Cry me a river

Cry me a river (Yeah, let her go ahead and cry man, go ahead)
Cry me a river (Go on and cry)

Cry me a river (Go ahead and cry)
Cry me a river (Mess up your mascara and all that girl)
