Yeah, it's like
It's like we locked in now
Kevon, its AZ baby
Twenty four

1  [Kevon]
    I think about you all the time
     24-7 babe
     The love I have inside for you
     Is more than any words can say
     Thanking God on bended knee
     We'll always be together babe
     You and me, 24-7
     Anything you need babe
     Pick you off your feet yeah
     We'll always be together babe
     You and me 24-7

Baby it's no mystery
You're bringing out the best in me
And though I've been in love before
I've never had the kind of love that made me feel secure
I never thought that give and take
Mentality was right for me
You made me open up and see
That it's for real
And there's no other place I'd rather be

Repeat 1

When I'm in my nine to five
I smile went across my lips when I
Daydream about the night before
I count the minutes till I'm in your arms once more
My friends they don't understand, no
In me they see a brand new man
I give you props and tell them that
My shorty's bout it
She personifies the love she gives

Repeat 1

Oh how I've waited for this moment in my life
It's you that I adore
Baby with you I am secure
My life is in your hands
And now I understand
What it is, what it is
What it is to be in love again

[AZ]
You can get it done like you
Fun like you
Twenty-four more reflect the sun like you
Flawless with your sleep walk, sweet and gorgeous
You know you all this, not only one for me to ball with
Used to hustle for the cause so we both need one
But I was strapped in, stressed and emotionally done
And open me young, no sleep smoke in my lung
Chosen path but the Aftermath showed me some
Now it's properly, palm dropping trees
White sand at the v's and shopping sprees
Here for you, holla and it's there for you
Prayers for you, bust off in the air for you
Pretty young thing, hair back, oil machine
Canary box like thirty g's spent in one bank
24-7, it's all love all heaven
All thug divine four, nine, three, eleven, come on

Repeat 1 till end</pre>
