Spoken Intro: 
(Smoking &amp; Coughing)
God damn!
This goes out to you bitch ass niggas speaking bad on the dead
This goes out to my nigga Makaveli
I wanna say what's up to my nigga Makaveli
Rest in playa pieces
Niggas die...daily

Verse 1:
Live the murderous lifestyle
Seeing niggas get smothered
With my foot in the grave and the other in the gutter
Bred being a drug dealer, natural born thug nigga
Ballin' with mob figures, soldiers and real killas
Tellin' my homies when we hit the weed
Avenge me if I die by my enemies
Make sure they bleed
Put their faces on the front page
Blow a nigga in his dome, close range with tha muthafuckin' 12 gauge
And tell 'em Bossalini called the shots
Still lookin for them bitch ass niggas that murdered my homie Pac
Locked up my nigga Major Pain
Cause they can't fuck with the realism that came from a niggas brain
You jealous muthafuckas still got me strapped
I be smokin' on chronic sacks with death knockin' at my back
I'm going crazy, seeing shit that ain't real
Drunk and shootin' at niggas that I done already killed

CHORUS:
Trying to get to ghetto heaven cause i'm born to die
Hopin' the Lord will see my reason when he asks me why
Trying to get to ghetto heaven cause i'm born to die
Hopin' the Lord will see my reason when he asks me why
Make sure they bleed
Make sure they bleed
If I die by my enemies make sure they bleed

Verse 2:
Should they speak on a soldier when he dead
Cause when he's livin' all the drama you spittin get your muthafuckin weed
splittin
Get your money while you still on this earth
Born sinnin' from birth
Black hearses cursing the turf
Carrying dead bodies to the church
Ashes to dirt, niggas be restin' in playa pieces like Tutinkam (spelling's
wrong)
Ain't no cowards in the game nigga, it's Vietnam
Keep your killa partners with you but don't keep them too close
Cause some niggas is magicians, turn your ass to a ghost
And have you watch your body, lookin' at your corpse full of holes
Cause some niggas appear to be friends and foes
Who really knows?
It's a fucked up world, niggas murder you while you sleeping
And I'm waitin' to catch 'em creepin'
Bitch ass niggas get to die with their eyes open
The only real drama is two guns smokin'

CHORUS

Verse 3:
Welcome back to the ghetto, niggas still infected with thug disease
Felonies, 60 g's for 2 ki's
??? We all around
When it comes to the root of the evil we all down
Thugs crying with tears made a cop ???
Lord, what about the guard of the pen in the gun tower
Is he going to hell for killin' niggas escapin'?
Or going crazy cause his freedoms takin'?
Born sinning, niggas dying with their nikes on
I'm bringing fear to my enemies, keep them sleeping with their lights on
Witnessing death on the streets, muthafuckas be dying daily
All the O.G. niggas giving game to thug babies
If them niggas catch you slipping than your ass is gone
Take your muthafucking head, ain't no vest for your dome
