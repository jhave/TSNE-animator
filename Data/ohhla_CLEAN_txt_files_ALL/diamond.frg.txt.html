Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Diamond Dust oooo it's so cold
She don't feel her face, and he don't feel his nose
D-D-D-Diamond Dust It'll leave you cold
Where yo body heat? Ooo now his feet is swoll
D-D-D-Diamond Dust, Living in this cold world
Fuckin with that China White, Ooo that's his old girl
Lookin for that new bitch, to make his toes curl
Dope bitch, fucking up his whole world!

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
I'm so high as fucking hell, That I can kiss the sky
The Devil tryna grip me, I can hear the angels cry
That's my momma and my auntie screaming "You just a bunch of lies"
And my girl just caught me stealing, I just bought her the new iPhone
Drugs are my new friends and they just getting tall
My boss just caught me beaming, so you know that I got fired
And my clothes is getting old and my hair used to be wavy
Shit, this the life of crack, when you growing up in the 80's

And I've been smoking, Lord please help
Cause I'm going out of my mind
I can hear my heart beat, think I'm running out some time
Where do I go from here, do I lay here and just die?
I can see pearly gates, matter fact I've just changed my mind
I don't wanna go, go, think I'm going out of my mind
I can hear my heart beat, think I'm running out some time
Where do I go from here, do I lay here and just die?
I can see pearly gates, matter fact I've just changed my mind

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Hi my name is Becky, and I used to wanna be famous
I sniffed away my brains, and the itches make me insane, oh
And I used to hang with Dana, used to party with the Lakers
Used to travel with the Indiana Pacers
I used to wanna cheer but they didn't wanna take us
Cause now I'm faded, now my whole world is jaded
Damn I thought I made it, living out my dreams
But this whole time I was faking
I was faking
And this is what that diamond does
And this is from that diamond dust
And this is from that diamond dust
And this is what that diamond does

[Chorus]</pre>
