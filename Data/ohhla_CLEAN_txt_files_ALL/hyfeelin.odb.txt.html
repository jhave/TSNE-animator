[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard (girl)]
Oh yeah...
What what, got your money
What what, (dirty), what what
What what, (dirty), yeah, yeah

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
My niggas better raise it up, fruit punch in my cup, so what?
Ol' Dirty, I served my time, now I'm out and gonna have a good time
My new account is kinda different, cuz I'm 'ready spendin' all my dimes
What what, give me a check for 9, zero, zero, zero, zero
Count count 'em, muthafucka, this mine
Now, I just better finish my rhyme
Before my muthafuck' appeal come, what the fucking due line

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
No, sip-ping, alco-hol, at all (no way)
No, smo-king, Phil-ly, blunts, or Backwoods (no way)
No, lea-ving, the state, of New York (stay home)
It's, all good, long as I can, still feel some breasts

[Chorus 2X: girl (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
(And how ya feeling, Dirty?) I feel good!
(I'm glad you are) Yeah, me too!
(I wanna love you, Dirty) I wanna love you back!
(Can I get a..) baby, just, baby just, wiggle that booty!

[Bridge: girl]
Ahhhhh, a wiggle-wiggle, a wiggle-wiggle
Dirty...

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I never will forget the way
Dame Dash, send a limo for me
(What what), signed me up for the team
VH1, caught me doing my thing
I had bitches in the limo actin' like they fucking rolling with king
Shopping sprees on Fifth Ave., backrubs, bubble baths
Ol' Dirty fucked, come, clean my ass
Now I'm straight, gotta spit for my chips
With nothing in my system that would get me incarcerated

[Hook]

[Bridge 2X]

[Chorus 2X]

[Bridge 2X]

[Interlude: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Sing this song
Dirt, Dirt, Dirt, Dirt McGirt, Girt, Girt, Girt
Straight from Wu, Wu who?, Wu who? Wu who?, ahh
Dirt, Dirt, Dirt, Dirt McGirt, Girt, Girt, Girt
Straight from Wu, Wu who?, Wu who? Wu who?, ahh
Dirt, Dirt, Dirt, Dirt McGirt, Girt, Girt, Girt
Straight from Wu, Wu who?, Wu who? Wu who?, ahh
