*SPOKEN*
Oh my gosh, is this all for me, I feel like singing!

*RAPPING*
Golden Keys, cash on trees, raining men its all for me geez
Everyone here got the name C wow they all like bowin to me- I must be the King C
Feelin super Oompa Loopa boomin in my jeep damn sweet super duper
10 washing machines 10 jeeps on auction for me 10 peeps to wash it for me
Come this winter nobody shiver good swimmer get in my chocolate river
Give me a kiss I'm a magic princess Wonder Woman shoot shit out my wrist
This here is bliss everyone's sexy no more acne or Gap khakis
I can solve all your problems just ask me
and here all my black friends can get taxis
Sparkle all my records gone Plat
I take it back, ain't no Billboard where I'm at
Take a second I grab bad thought and wreck it check out my magic record
Get a massage 10 car garage livin type large oh wait there's no more cars 
Fix the air for kicks this chicks in charge pick 6 Knicks tix free of charge
Neck and neck deck to deck equal sex
Best protect--nothin--ain't nothin more to protect
No Smack no more attacks Mickey Mouse got our motherfuckin backs
No ice just wax, no tax just spice, damn we feel nice
No roaches or mice just coaches and kites comfy sofas and Sprites
Everyone lives life how they like
This this here is dynamite</pre>
