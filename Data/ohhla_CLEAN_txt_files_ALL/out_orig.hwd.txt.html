[Mase] 
Yo, this go out to radio stations 
The disc jockeys, college radio 
Independent market 
And promotions street team 
Anybody who put a sticker up 
Anybody that passed the word bout Harlem World 
Anybody that kept the buzz goin 
Everybody that starred in Harlem World 
And myself M A $ E, Baby Stase 
Loon, Meeno, Blinky Blink 
Huddy Combs, Cardan 
All Out 

[Meeno] 
There's a lot of things that been on my mine 
Lately a lot a fakes been crossing the line 
Tryin to take the track we hit on 
Throw it down and spit on, flip it, rearrange 
Boy, you messin with danger 
Wit the anger I possess 
Got to get it off my chest 
Brutalize fake emcees to get off my stress 
Take a pellet to the face 
Then I throw on a vest 
Then I grab the gloves 
And take the bullet out his chest 
Must confess 
Stress factor still I have to 
Take it there beware, prepare for disaster 
Final chapter, y'all cowards 
We gon blast ya 
When and where but not why 
Y'all already know the answer 
Cancer and the Herbs 
Transform to verbs 
Nouns rip like rounds 
Clowns get bust down 
For now y'all cowards got to play the background 
I'm the warning of this rap game its time for lock down 

[Baby Stase] 
God Bless you 
The cops came to your rescue 
I bet you, if it was Ma$e he would of threat you 
I knew you wasn't shit before I met you 
And just because you can't walk it 
Don't mean you cant talk it 
My cats got mels to hit, shells to spit 
They low in the Volvo while the L's get lit 
I'm from Harlem World 
You don't know the hell I'm wit 
So y'all chics can't tell me shit 
Come on now, everyone clear the way 
Under cars better stay 
Shots will ricochet 
Stay alive another day 
It's no lame in my staff 
We don't aim for cats 
So if I smack you who gon back you 
You ain't see nothin 
My home made me somethin 
Stase gt glamour misses down south gettin riches 
And that's word to Jehovah witness 
Any man cross this fam get beat up wit the quickness 

[Cardan] 
Yo, let me tell you somethin', I'm ahead of my time 
Ain't no damn pellets, this is lead in my rhyme 
When I spit this stuff you know 
Get a pen and pad dido 
This one stop at 62, I'm a spit through ten mo 
It kinda like the window, back of the Volvo limo 
Cuda, don't tell me nothin if ain't about my ammo 
All I did was 2 Clue's that was just a demo 
Went from Harlem to Holly 
World to the Wood 
People gon hate regardless I feel so good 
For my AC legend 
Now I'm a legend sit on my hood 
They say B you doin your thing I say playa I should 
I play hard like the Notorious rapper 
Slash B.I.G. slash Christopher 
King of New York the Emperor 
Slash head fake slash in the paint horse you 
Slash perimeter slash Air Jordan cross you 
Slash Murphy slash four turn delirious 
Slash Cardan slash take my stuff seriously 
what?

[Huddy Combs] 
I'm getting bigger dough spotin minks and figaro's 
All my misses know Huddy Comb the jigalo 
I can get a ho play a game like Piccolo 
I done did it yo than any cat didn't ya know? 
So what you wanna do my whole team comin thru 
Runnin thru any crew I gave money to 
But really though 
Y'all cats that know don't really know 
Harlem World gon be the clique that spit that willy flow 
All them rings and things you sing about bring em out 
I did things that your team won't dream about 
Scheme about but don't really know a thing about 
But for the dough I blow any spot you slingin out 

[Blinky Blink] 
You wanna go to war, what you cock sucker 
I pulled out now I got to bust ya 
And your men from your block told me not to trust ya 
I did movies, to groupies, to blockbusters 
For all you girls out there I'm not ya lover 
You look good that's why I got to touch ya 
After that I won't even stop to hug ya 
Honey got pissed off and got her brother 
But word to mother, I break that cat into 
Cause people don't know all the things I been thru 
Still a fugitive like Chris and Kim woo 
Yep the cops disrespect me 
But if you want me come and get me 
Turn myself in nah you got to catch me 
Do I got a gun you betta check me 
Cause I ain't goin in alive you got to wet me 

[Loon] 
Yo, ya eyes been revealin ya past 
Sad but you feelin my wrath 
You mad cuz I'm dealin wit cash 
And a Don P cylinder glass 
Try to harm me, I'm killin your ass 
Straight up and down for another half mill in a stash 
I'm appearful willin to blast 
I'm still in the bath 
Loungin chillin wit ass 
They done found you killed in the trash 
Case is close I'm orderin a case of mo 
At the shark bar wit Haitian hoes 

[Mase] 
Aight Hud,  aight Hud 

[Loon] 
Y'all case is closed layin the cut like band-aids 
Air runnin out ya mouth while you and ya man slayed 

[Mase] 
Yo, Mase hop out the blue Lex wit about two teks 
Spit fourteen got about two left 
If one vest is thin you rock two vest 
Triple platinum and only in the U.S 
I'm from Harlem World slash All Out dot com 
My con if you could pop Cris then why pop Don 
Any cat actin ra-ra bet he dacon 
Wanna see a hundred gran 
You look at my arm 
You think I wanna take this to far in my rugar 
Put a hollow bullet to far 
Have cats at ya wake scream bout how they knew ya 
And ya body in a salt lake out in Utah 
So you are feel good, leave the country 
And I know where you are 
Spain baggage claim and you yellin bon swa 
You think I'm comfy 
Think murder one go humphrey 
Think I'm seven five make to hundred gran monthly 
Wanna lump me 
Walk in clubs they bump me 
Wanna tell they dumb chickens how they jump me 
They can't wait to see the paramedics come to pump me 
Why they OT, I'm mostly out the country 

ALL OUT </pre>
