Song:   Mercy On My Soul 
Typed by: EattWhtysWhytyFrd@aol.com 

A trust betrayed a rusty blade 
Standing on edge 
I walked a line, paid my fine 
Hope I know the ledge 
Actual facts, unnatural acts, sins they take their toll 
The angel and the jinn and the beast within, the fight to take control 

Chorus 

Lord, have mercy on my soul 
On my soul, on my soul, on my soul 

Lord, I need ya like a junkie needs his drugs 
Need ya like a baby boy needs his hugs 
Need ya like a flower needs the sun 
I need you like D.M.C needs Run 

Chorus 

Love you like a Eskimos love the cold 
Love you like a miner man love his gold 
Love you like a fisherman love the sea 
Love you like the flowers love the bees 

Chorus 

Standing up tall on top of the wall 
Hoping I can fly Angel and the jinn 
and the beast within' say I'm gonna die 

Chorus </pre>
