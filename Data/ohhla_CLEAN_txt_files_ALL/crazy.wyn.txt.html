(Verse 1, Lil Wayne)
And tonight's the night
And them girls all on me like white on rice
And I get 'em to the crib, play two-on-one
I'm, already high, now is you on one?
Take a jet to the sunset, you wan' come?
Or, sit in my Phantom and chew on gum?
Baby, I could take you to and from
Ice up ya lil wrist, til' ya blue hand numb
Umm, ya dealin' wit' a boss lil mama
Young Wayne, tell me my time bud
If you hangin' with the homies, I'll holla
And if ya man ain't me, why bother?
I go by the name Carter
I got more plaques than tarter
I'm just checkin' out the charts on the charter
Number one spot, Wayne and Paula

(Hook, Paula)
Ohh-ohh
You got them goin' crazy you see (Ohh-ohh)
Head-over-heels for me, boy (Ohh-ohh)
Weak in the knees for me, boy (Ohh-ohh)
Cause you so, damn easy (Ohh-ohh)

Got them goin' crazy you see (Ohh-ohh)
Head-over-heels for me, boy (Ohh-ohh)
Weak in the knees for me, boy (Ohh-ohh)
Cause you so, damn easy (Ohh-ohh)

Don't be so, damn easy
Don't be so, d-d-d-damn easy</pre>
