[Tech N9ne]
Mitch Bade (3x)

[Chorus - Tech N9ne]
What is an M-I-T-C-H
A nigga who's a B-I-T-C-H
He never wants to - congradulate, he hates
Cuz he's a fucking M-I-T-C-H

[Tech N9ne]
What up Mitch
Is it an every day thing for you to act just like a bitch
How does it feel, to have a nigga that will kill
ya, for the foul shit you pitch
Number one snitch
A bitch with a dick
I found the remedy for the enemy
(What?)
Bust at a nigga like shootin' at the Kennedies
Cuz Mitch Bade really ain't no friend of me

[Bakarii] (Tech N9ne)
To be exact
He's a nigga that talk but he really can't back
That shit he talks so he gotta walk around with a gat
But a nigga like me, (I'll knock 'em out with the force of a hurricane)
The penalty from the path if you disrespect the game

[Tech N9ne] (Bakarii)
Now what goes on inside the mind of a nigga like this
This nigga pissed
Cuz I pump bout four rounds up in the trick that he's with
But it ain't my fault you're a little bitch
(Without yo click)
Nigga run with the quickness
(Get away quick but you'd best not slip)
Better off with a bianca than get stuck
(With an Ak-47 on yo lip)
Right

[Bakarii]
Even if I'm lifted I can scope him from a mile away
Niggaz fakin' like anticipating their doom's day

[Tech N9ne]
Camouflaging but I can see you acting like a bitch
Which are the symptons of a nigga named Mitch

[Chorus - Tech N9ne (Bakarii)]
Have you ever met a nigga who was pie sprung
There's a lot of slinkin niggaz where I come from
There's another missle catcher just like him
His name is Mitchell Bade (Mitch Bade) Mitchell Bade (Mitch Bade)
If a Mitch is in your mix you best to check one (you gotsta check one)
And be re'd' to for milli when the next one come
If a nigga got a foot up in his rectum
His name is Mitchell Bade (Mitch Bade) Mitchell Bade (Mitch Bade)

[Big Scoop]
Niggaz know me
Big homie from the show me
Cookin' up by the O-Z's
Let 'em go for the low fee
Gritty, grimey all day all night
All I know is, get that cash
Any nigga that's in my path
All I know is, bust that ass
Ain't much changed Villian
Still with this game Villian
Still dubbin' that 'caine
Poppin' our vein
Fuckin' yo brain Villian
But Mitch done made his way and slithered in our shit again
It's 2K2 and now we dealin' with this shit again

[Txx Will]
Now look at this nigga let that pussy get him whipped
See us lookin' from the club and he wanna trip
That's when I peep this nigga had a weakness
Don't wanna start no street shit
Not over this freak bitch
He should be glad that I showed him
You can only trust a cock about as far as you can throw him
So let that trick do just what that trick do
Or get labelled Mitchell
And smacked with a pistol

[Chorus - Tech N9ne (Bakarii)]
Have you ever met a nigga who was pie sprung
There's a lot of slinkin niggaz where I come from
There's another missle catcher just like him
His name is Mitchell Bade (Mitch Bade) Mitchell Bade (Mitch Bade)

And be re'd' to for milli when the next one come
If a nigga got a foot up in his rectum
His name is Mitchell Bade (Mitch Bade) Mitchell Bade (Mitch Bade)

[Bakarii]
Toss it to Bakarii
Bitches mackin, feelin
Doin' my dealin'
I hit the pussy first night then escaped like a Villian
You takin' her feelings and give her diamond rings and things
I'm tappin' the pussy and bustin' head, fortune springs a Villian
You better watch her man
You better stop her man
She's with my dogs at the mall better drop her hand
Cuz she's addicted to them dogs with them roguish ways
Who chop up ? and throw them things on that Mitchell Bade

[Tech N9ne]
Cruisin' down the spec with
(Who?)
Texas, action, neckage
With a sex kit
And Tech got the best bitch
(Chu)
But her nigga's on some next shit (next shit)
Cuz she tested Tech's dick for breakfast
Stress hits, domestic
Go!
Nigga wanna get up in the thing wit' me
For a bitch who never ever meant a thing to me
(Boooonk)
Nigga wanna and come sing with me for a bitch that wanna do a tagteam wit' me
(Boooonk)
Never ever been a thing to me to get bitches up in the middle of a thing? with these
('Iaaancs)
Mothafucker wanna strangle me
(Zoooonk)
It ain't never been a mothafucking thing for me to
(Duuuump)
Once again Mitch Bade
Gets played
Nigga should've never layed with a stray hoe
Pimp shit displayed
This way
They want a nigga when they hear him on the radio
Like a bitch I call ??
Back in the club she's down on her knees
Lickin' my balls
Out of my drawers
Ya nigga bustin' like "Aw naw!"
Playa haters wanna box with a boot knock
(Cha)
Cuz the hoe bitch blew me out of two sock
(Cha)
So we do it in the parking lot
I heard a nigga bust two shots (two shots)
? with a thing that I knew pop (knew pop)
With a whole lot of Hoo hop
Nigga you can bet when his crew got
hit, a mothafucker with a heater
'Bout to do a nigga prrrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaah!

[Chorus - Tech N9ne (Bakarii)]
