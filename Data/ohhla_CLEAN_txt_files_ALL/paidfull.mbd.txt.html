Yo, yo, it's like this Dunn
Uh-huh, yo

Sittin back plottin on ways
How we can get this money, we need us a payday
Dig in my pocket, it's nuttin but change
I dig deeper, but still comin up wit change
So we, called our lawyers to fix this shit
He said it's aight, we bout to be _Free Agents_
Have patience, we can't though, we need paper
Like thirty-five million'll straighten us up
It's nuttin for us to make these songs that bump
Shit that out, then tour for like six months but..
This can't be life, this can't be all there is for us
We need more cream to splurge
Thinkin back, how we used to pick herbs
Me and Hav' in Manhattan, stickin up cowards
for they wallets and Starter hats
For anything worth somethin, we beat 'em out of that
But fuck all that, we grown men, we need Porsches
We need Porsche endorsements and more shit
Yeah Dunn, that sound righteous
I feel stressed though -- so I just
hop in my truck for a drive
Bring my nine, cause that's how I stay alive
As I peel in my Jeep, turnin up this
Goin through withdrawal cause man do I miss
A pint of E&amp;J, some haze, a twist
Me and Hav' on a flight to Rome witcho' bitch
Yes, that's my favorite shit
But without the dollars it don't make sense
So I, write that shit that grab you
Hit up the studio, that's how we get paid in full
YEAH - that's what we get paid to do
The next contract we sign'll be monumental

[Havoc]
Uh-huh, yo.. sittin contemplatin on plans
Like a bomb with a short fuse with this gat inside my hand
I need paper, lookin at these stick-up kids
Got me thinkin bout the previous things I did
Gettin bent up, feelin fed up, whattup Dunny
Stomach touchin, niggaz over here type hungry
Waitin on my turn just got me hyper
And impatient, maybe I might just
Lurk with my forty-five, if you outside
I advise yo' ass to hide
We talk with the heat, lettin it spit
Move out the way and you can STILL get hit
They wonder why I'm riskin all this cash I made
Put your feet in my shoes you gon' see it my way..
So niggaz wanna stunt it's cool
My stomach never full, and I will eat your food

[Prodigy]
Aiyyo Hav', check this out
You go to your girl house and I'll go to mines
Cause my girl definitely mad it took us too long to do this album

[Havoc]
Yeah and call Chris Shapiro to make sure they triple that advance man

[Prodigy]
Aight, no doubt, don't forget we got a flight early tomorrow
Gotta be on time

[Havoc]
No doubt, I'ma see you there my nigga
Make sure you remind Noyd, to call Alchemist, and we good

[Prodigy]
Aight, no question son
Aiyyo what happened to peace? .. {PEACE!!}
