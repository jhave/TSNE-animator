[Intro] [Luckyiam.PSC talking]
Man, I can't believe that dude came up to me talkin'
He had the audacity to think that was like, cool or somethin'
Just all up in my ear, talkin' all that game
Yap yap yap yap yap

[Verse One] [Luckyiam.PSC]
When the path of some discussions change up like percussion
The tempo of some conversations leave me out in limbo
Here's something
You might have been through
Or maybe, you haven't been through
It's simple
To be the devil's advocate with your opinions
True stories
They never bore me
The true, they don't ignore me
It's amazing when they think they know you so well 
To tell the tales
Foot in their mouths
Packed with negativity
Talkin' about my family, thinkin' that it's just you and me
No, I'm not Corey 
And no Corey ain't Tom
And no your smoke ain't the bomb
Ain't tryin' to put you on in the mix of things
Tricks they got, keen eyesight
They focus upon those in magazine's that hold mics
Alright, up in the bull's eye, dodgin' all the bullshit
Holdin' onto sanity, stay away from full clips
These two tricks approached me one day after one show
And said, "Yo, I like your flow. But man, you really should go solo."
I took a pause
Let the lighter ignite my beadie
Then I turned around and slapped them little fools with my CD
On me, don't ever walk up and disrespect my brothers
Unless, you want some trouble from a rather peaceful brother
A wrong turn, made in an effort to rub elbows
First impressions stick like bitch covered in Elmer's (glue)
"Ahh, it sticks"

[Chorus]
It's the outlandish things they wanna say to me
Who do you claim to be? You're just ashamed of me
You want to hit us with your gossip but you're really out of pocket
Take your mouth and lock it
Zip it
Stop it
The outlandish things they wanna say to me
Who do you claim to be? You're like the same to we
Too many slick at the lip when they can't skip it towards me
With the ideas they had
Most of them just bore me

[Verse Two] [The Grouch]
Now I do take criticisms like shits and flush 'em
Undeservin' egos
Me? I crush 'em
Hush 'em in the cock pit for snubbin' up my folks
Crackin' jokes
Laughin' at the stories we collected like some soaps
I'm the fuck off the ropes cause I never listen hard
When Four Track tapes might has well have been barred
You gained a foot I gained a yard
You're in the door, I built a second floor
When you hand me a flier to my own show I'm steppin' more
Faster
Protectin' mine like masters
I didn't ask for your opinion
Why would I? You're beginnin' 
Or else you're on your way out
Seein' the light as it fades out
Yours is over here
Fork it over dear
That's my money
When you start actin' funny then I know it is
And when they say I sound like someone else they must be blowin' 
His dick (slurp slurp)
And he knows you're a jerk because he told me
And when we do a song, then you're gonna have to like me
And if you only like me, then you're gonna have to like him
That's the way we're writin'
Signin' off, A Titan

[Chorus]
It's the outlandish things they wanna say to me
Who do you claim to be? You're just ashamed of me
You want to hit us with your gossip but you're really out of pocket
Take your mouth and lock it
Zip it
Stop it
The outlandish things they wanna say to me
Who do you claim to be? You're just ashamed of me
You want to hit us with your gossip but you're really out of pocket
Take your mouth and lock it
Zip it

[Verse Three] [MURS]
Bitch said, "The Grouch? Uuuuah!
Doesn't he still live with his mom and make beats in the basement? Duuh?
Aren't Tom and Corey a little too old to be rapping?
I mean it's all good and everything because you see, you're young
But I used to go to parties back at um, 4001
Don't you think about the future? I mean it used to be cool
But what about going jobs and goin' to school?"
"Bitch, look at your life! Ain't you shootin' porn?"
Ain't nothin' worse than a fuckin' groupie scorn
Speakin' on my crew, like that's not my family
You should really watch for who, you choose to speak candidly 
Cause I'm a tattle tale
Bout to e-mail the crew with them words you just said
Should have gave me (skull) instead of talkin' head
Now you got me walkin' Fed Express towards the exit
Just like I had a motor
But first I crossed paths with this dick head promoter
"Aye aye, you need to do my club."
Knows I rock for free cause I do it for the love
I said, "Please don't curse
L-O-V-E, shit that's a four letter word
So I'ma let you know just in case you haven't heard
I don't MC for free
And that's period
So if it ain't doe, then I'm really not hearin' it."
"Oh you gotta be jokin'."
"Hell, naw I'm serious
Respect my authori-tie 
And quit ignorin' my receipt for dues paid
I mean, who's brigade was you really tryin' to ask?
I mean, that shit is in the past
Rockin' shows for petty cash
I already mashed on your homie
For comin' at me the wrong way."
It's about to be a long day
I exit the wrong way in an attempt to escape
The fools out front beggin' for the free tape
Cause my name's on the bill
They think I'm full blown
But I also got my name on some bills at home
And I can't pay for shit with a dope freestyle
Beadie breath and a smile is all you gettin' from me
So when you disappointed by that wack show that you see
Just think to yourself, "FUCK! I should've just bought a Good Music CD."</pre>
