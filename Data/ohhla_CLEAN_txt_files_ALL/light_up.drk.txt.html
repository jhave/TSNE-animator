[Drake]
Uhh, I've been up for fo' days, gettin money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinkin how young can you die from old age
They always tell me "Nobody's workin as hard as you"
And even though I laugh it off man it's probably true
Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin
I'm just here makin all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous, prom night nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin grown man liars
Story tellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr
was in "Sunset Park" stuntin hard in his yellow goose
Yeah, and I'm a muh'fuckin missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin to themselves Hov', hands-free
Yeah, and I'm just fillin up this daily planner
Gettin busy cause I'm a +Star+, no +Spangled Banner+
Jealous dudes get to talkin in they music
and I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doin you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow talkin with the women that are screwin you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
You drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

[Chorus: Drake]
Who, would've thought
I'd be caught, in this life
Let's celebrate, with a toast
And get lost, in tonight
And make it all light up...
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up...
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go

[Jay-Z]
Ay Guru tell, tell homegirl to open that Ace right there...

Owwww! Hoes turn they heads like, owwwwls
I'm the man of the, hour
Triple entrendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights'll make your whole city light up
A trillion watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G-450
Caught the Mayweather fight cause the satellite was crispy
Uh, y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov', fuck what the dummies talk
Uh, I don't do too much bloggin
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin
Mm, I ain't got a scar yet
Cause you fuckin 'round with me and my dawgs is farfetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds tryin to distract you
In disguise in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors
Uh, I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggaz I'm like, Windows 7
You let 'em tell it they swear, that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggaz as I once was
I once was, cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry momma I promised it wouldn't change me
but I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggaz, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do

[Chorus]</pre>
