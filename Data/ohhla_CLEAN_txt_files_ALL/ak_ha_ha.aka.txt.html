Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

It's the ak ha ha, the ak hoo hoo (Akineyle) 

Verse One: 

Yo, y'all know what's about to happen 
When I proceed to give you what you need and the Ak start rappin 
I throw rhymes like children throwin balls on project bricks 
In other words I be kickin that old off the wall shit 
I don't rehearse they don't come better than 
I don't need light, cuz I'm a late night person like David Letterman 
You know the whole repoitoire not far from a star 
Baby Pah, the Ak can shine like ArmorAll 

Chorus 

Verse Two: 

Akineyle, producing more stunning hits 
So call me Ex-Lax, cuz I'm about ready to start runnin shit 
Toss and TURNIN ya, watch Ak BURNIN ya 
You can't hold your own you fuck around and catch a HERNIA
(Akineyle) 
So don't sleep, nor yet drowsing 
My name itself bring more Heartbeats than Robert Townsend 
I hurdle over rappers like a stallion 
Carry it back with more Fame than Debbie Allen, nigga 

Chorus 

Verse Three: 

My lyrics'll reign real bright so dim the lights and it won't get DULLER 
It doesn't take Rosie Perez to see my living COLOR 
I rain over heads just like an UMBRELLA 
So strong that baby's boosted and I'm FULLER 
History in the making, never one for backspins 
throw and kneel, but you're still, MC's I be BREAKIN 
Ak saniTATION 
I leave skid marks on the concrete streets 
from all the brothers that I be scrapin 

Chorus 

Verse Four: 

Permanent scars as I sabotage 
My style's so milky I should get down with Haagen-Daaz 
More heatwave than a do rag does to a CAESAR 
Give a thermometer a temperature of jungle FEVER 
George like WHEEZY 
Cuz I be burnin brothers just like, the neighborhood SKEEZER 
Once the hip-hop strangeler 
I throw your whole rap on a coat rack kid and just hang it up 

Chorus 

Verse Five: 

So step to the AK-ER, the hip-HOPPER 
And get your ass kicked like a game of SOCCER 
Skills are fatter than a grease spot 
cuz I love to rock that nasty home-cooked hip-hop 
I watch girls check it, I make bitches wanna jump butt-naked 
Like the Doo Doo Brown record 
But now I peep on low and they have to stop 
When they hear my name, the motherfuckin Ak</pre>
