[Fryaser Boy - Intro]
Cut the lights out
Fryaser boy, Chrome, Hypnotize minds
We bout to ride down on all these fake ass niggaz

We gona help them make they motherfukin mind up

[Chorus]
Niggaz been so serious, I cant play no games no more
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Niggaz been so serious, I cant play no games no more
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score

[Frayser Boy]
Ima tell 'em how I really feel, ain't gon sugar coat nothin
Me and Chrome see them tone, bro we bout to go huntin
Snitchin cause you know somethin
You cant stop a real one
Catch 'em slippin go bananas niggaz got to peel em
For sure its gettin hectic, its HCP respect it
I sleep with one eye closed pistol stay ready
You didnt expect this Frayser Boy and Young Chrome
He lack the family Paul and Juicy made him come home

[Chrome]
I'm chillin out at the Marriott, sippin on lean
Servin this nigga next door pass the morphine
Then my phone ring, its my nigga Frayser-Beezy
Sayin he know this nigga who got birds and he easy
Talkin like he the man, since he open up shop
Knowin he ain't real, ima give 'em what I got
I'm from the bricks, the project, pop 'em on the spot
Catch 'em walkin up out the door with a small package

[Chorus]
Niggaz been so serious, I cant play no games no more
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Niggaz been so serious, I cant play no games no more
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Yeaaaa!

[Chrome]
Nigga I been held with a small clientele
Niggaz dont wanna see me I can see it I can tell
In or out the booth nigga im the damn truth
So I advise you week niggaz (echo)
Slow your role lil dude or youll get yourself hurt
Fuckin with real niggaz we leave blood on your shirt
Its your boy Chrome, born and raised in Tennekey
Ya we takin hits, go on run up and get split, bitch!

[Frayser Boy]
Nigga ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Have a nigga ass missin if he fuck with us
Thats real, nigga im high too, we bout to ride foo
My pistol is my navigation I can find you
It ain't a thing nigga I can come and get witchu
I said it once, I ain't fuckin witchu bitch niggaz
Wrong one to fuck with, bullets make you duck quick
Bring it to the floor hoe, wanna try your luck bitch?

[Chorus]
Niggaz been so serious, I cant play no games no more
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Niggaz been so serious, I cant play no games no more
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
Niggaz actin curious, but I think they know the score
