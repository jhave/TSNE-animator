[Napoleon (Benzino)]
Don't worry soulja (Made Men, Outlawz)
Yo, pain ain't nuthin but a part of the game
They got us real fucked up
Ain't nuthin but a part of the game, deal wit it

[Napoleon]
Life -- is a hustle, I got my .45 waitin to bubble
I lost a lot of my loved ones to the struggle
It's like I'm holdin back my breath through a muzzle
It's like I got one more piece to complete the puzzle
You only got one chance cuz I don't love you
And I'll be boned if I cock back and slug you
For all my dead niggas, that's above you
It's like a feud, my family ain't around they done
And if I lose one more soulja I'ma drown someone
Who Makaveli? I give you eight to ya belly
For Killa Khadafi, please tell the cops to stop me
My brother Seeky, I'ma ride all night for ya
And do the same for Gustafa and Big Mike soulja
This to my main man comin from a Made nigga
I feel your pain, hold ya head, let's get paid nigga

[Benzino]
Yo hear my number Polly, call me
And anytime you wanna talk about the situation, involve me
I understand just what your goin through
I lost niggas too.. I shed tears too..
I can't cry no more, yo Tony what'chu die for?
Three strike 915 is what I ride for
You and Roc hold it down, we aight (we aight)
We with the Outlawz, sippin Henny all night
Been goin through that shit since day one
I think I live this long, cuz I live by the gun
But that's the question, I know my life is dee-per so feel me
Cheated death many times when niggas tryed to kill me

[Chorus - Young Noble]
I feel yo' pain! - Sick torment 'til he's guarded
Keep us caged like dogs, go to shit in the yard
I feel yo' pain! - Drownin in the rain and shit
The only thing that's fucked up, we can't change this shit
I feel yo' pain! - Nigga yo I'm just like them
When I was broke on the block I had clips like them
I feel yo' pain! - Speak it to ya straight from the heart
No matter what you come across you gotta live, get lost

[Kastro]
Ain't nothin to fear in this love affair, when shared with the streets
I'm in deep losin all kinds of sleep
Ain't no love, so my eyes don't blink
And I'm so shell-shocked I need to see a shrink
It stink, stinks so much I can't think
And when it hurts too bad, I numb it up with a drink
And chase my liqour with a bad temper
Too fuckin blind for the big picture
Losin my mind, it's just a sign of the times,
and when my loved ones go, part of my insides dying wit 'em
Shit, ain't nobody to blame, can't nobody complain
Can you feel my pain?

[E.D.I.]
Would you look into my world and tell me what you see now?
Nothing but emptiness, God replinish this
Fuckin with Devils shit I'm tryna stay righteous
Losin my love I ain't felt pain like this
Start of this motherfuckin game wasn't nice shit
I fuck around lost the one thing priceless
Cars and broads won't do, dawg'll slice shit
I'm just passin the time until my number hit
Fuck it I'll run wit it, until I feel I'm done wit it
Stack up the ones and let my sons come up rich
Clutchin a piece of the past, I move on
Using this pain to keep a nigga strong

[Chorus - Young Noble] 2x

I feel it...</pre>
