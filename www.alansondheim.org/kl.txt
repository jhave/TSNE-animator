

Exhibition [1989-1998]


To place myself on exhibition exposes me to sight, perspectival 
containment, the prison-house of language.
This occurs with the greatest degree of narcissism, en-trance 
into otherness and communal discursivities: I'm tagged for the occasion.
The speech is drawn from the exhibited who dwells in a kind of stupor
composed of stuttering and pauses in everyday conversation.
The exhibited procures his or her Nikuko-audience; day in and day out,
this happens as a continuous wager.
Thus everything is given, but this isn't difficult; within the exhibition,
there are few accouterments, and one travels holly-go-lightly.
Traveling so, memory alone remains - something replacing through its brute
inertia, the material world which is denied.
The material world so full of surprises!
The constituted world so full of givens, underlings! (I, myself ...)
I'm awash in the sea of my memories and the spectatorial speech
surrounding, overtaking me.
In the din of the exhibition, it's close to impossible to reconstruct
the origin of language; to construct a language; to hear the first
somnolent sounds of the beginnings of speech, why hello there.
Yet it's within this din that the origins have to be heard, this din,
and the distinction of the other occurring as I descend into the silence
of the vanishing-point of prey.

True Story of Inheritance


Katagawa Jinko died and Nikuko was put in charge of his manuscripts. She
remembers seeing a list of four men, and his name was the first. It was an
odd name and she had problems reading it. The kanji were dusty and almost
embedded in the wood; everything was close to disappearing, like wood sha-
vings hardly holding their own. She smiled and thought, now I am in charge
of the manuscripts.

She made a true or false answer to a question about one of the manuscripts
- is this a manuscript of Katagawa Jinko - there were three answers, none
of them were yes or no. I was quite upset. You're fooling around with this
famous author's manuscripts, I said; they'll be dispersed. Don't you have
any sympathy at all for the dead. She was contrite in fact at this, and
stopped dragging the kanji behind her in furrows marked almost by a sight
of miniature valleys left by looping trails in the dust, close to unread-
able, and close to disappearing. She'd hold onto the revelation, not
thinking further about it. It was enough; there were clouds of dust in the
sky, a sense of grit, wood-shavings, the kanji worn and chipped. It was
enough that she'd keep them, stop with the multiple-choice giveaways of
Katagawa Jinko's work.

oaTao


Thomas Merton, in The Way of Chuang Tzu, translates/paraphrases part of
xxii. 6. as follows: "The limit of the unlimited is called 'fullness.'
/ The limitlessness of the limited is called 'emptiness.' / Tao is the 
source of both. But it is itself / Neither fullness nor emptiness."

Now one can immediately dispense with the objection that 'fullness' it-
self constitutes a limit by virtue of the name, which is already given 
in "The limit of" much as "the greatest number" constitutes a name to 
which of course it is possible always to state "the greatest number plus
one," which, in any case, is taken care of vis-a-vis transfinite arith-
metic. But here, since TM writes in english, let us concentrate on "full-
ness" itself, the _u_ holding forth, either two vertical arms, or the
very bottom of a well; the sound, the ooo, fooolness, bringing to mind
both that of the mind of Chuang Tzu, or the depth of the unlimited as a
sound which one might call _om._ Here, not. Then, here.

"The limitlessness of the limited" falls away from the limited, and one
might recall here again, that which constitute the fundamental opera-
tions of the propositional logic, not-both-a-and-b and neither-a-nor-b,
the Sheffer stroke and its dual. Here too the limited is in a state of
detumescence, abandonment; "emptiness" is already a deflation from 
fullness, and fullness is inert, the sound hovering just above the dust
on the road where meditation occurs. Everything proceeds from nothing 
and nothing proceeds from everything, as long as you have both nothing 
and everything.

What is the source of both is what constitutes the gainsay-ing of the 
propositional logic in the first place, an inscription drawn or other-
wise stated, or a kanji which is the ur-symbol; here there is nothing 
but effacement, the symbol ground into the dust from which it apparently
springs. Nothing can be further from the truth; the symbol springs not
from dust, springs from nowhere, just as language arises as an emergence
through which syntax is constituted (re: protolanguage) perhaps - not 
the other way around.

If the socius originally communicates, it is in relation to survival - 
thirst, hunger, procreation, sleep, etc. - and play itself wavers as a
detour from this emptiness. What communicates runs rampant across drives,
instincts, and intentions, and it becomes evident that the distinctions
among these are problematized as lips turn back, teeth are bared, sudden-
ly redrawn into a smile.

But the Tao is neither one nor the other, abjuring inscription, or rather
effacing inscription at the very moment of its occurrence; kanji after
kanji become a tablet of remembrance, to the extent that culture and civ-
ilization continue to exist past the moment of birth. And Tao is also a
universal wager of the form _not this not that,_ _neti neti,_ which is, 
and now you see the genius or spark at work, precisely that of the stroke
or operation constituting logic, and, in other forms, set theory. 

In other words, withdrawal produces its own excrescences; creation of and
by the meek not only inherents the earth, but like weak theory, produces
it.

Permanent Milky Satori of Nikuko


I know the way all too well, Nikuko said. I know the contradictions, the
koans, the studies, the meditations, the beating-with-the-sticks, the
interiors and the exteriors, the postures, the inhalations and exhala-
tions, the chantings, the kendo and the slow-turning-towards-the-rising-
sun; I know the repetition of the Amida and the Lotus and the backwards-
and-forwards-writing; in an instant I am transported anywhere; in an in-
stant I am tremendously large or minutely small; in an instant I am an
other life or an other life beside my own; in an instant, I see myself
next to myself; in an instant I am you looking at me; in an instant I am
back again, me looking at you. I know the way of the mysteries and the
public way; I know the common way and the esoteric way; I know the Way  
and the way; I know the way of the Hidden Treasures; I am one of those
Treasures and I am not one of those Treasures. I am one and many and many
in one and one in many; I am unique; neither am I one nor an other but 
inviolate and unique, the way of the unicorn and the way of the Phoenix.
I have reached enlightenment; I have transcended the cycle of births and
deaths; I have become the cycle itself, slow wheel revolving in the dust
of kanji, forgotten abjurations, great worn wooden spokes of Nichirin and
Juggurnaut; I am the wheel and the Wheel; I am the Wheel and the Chariot;
I am the Spoke of the Wheel and Axle of the Chariot; I am the Reins and
the Beasts which pull; I am the Puller and the Pulled. I have become what
I have already been, and I have been what I will become. There is no other
and there is every other beside me; I am beside myself; I know the way;
the way is me; the way is not me.

A-Vowel


Boin, vowel, composed of mother-kanji and sound or tone-kanji, mother-tone
of the open mouth open throat running air into the _fullness_ of the sack
delimited, ah, ah: I, Daishin Nikuko, avow I am a vowel of the fullness of
the one or two or five or ten or split or doubled vowels; I am sounding
open pure tone mother-tone - tube or breathing tunicate, watering through
lungs and teeth, tongue of water, labia of teeth and lips and tongue, un-
formed sound emerging: I, Daishin Nikuko, avow this is the way and the Way
- this breathing-undifferentiation mother-tone flood-or-flow-of-vowelling,
fold-of-tongue-and-labia (Teeth! Out of the way!) (Tongue! Out of the
way!) (Lips! Out of the way!) (Mouth! Out of the Way!) (Daishin Nikuko!
OUT OF THE WAY!) - 

"The defeat of the foe occurs when he accommodates his form to the hollow
in space that one has already marked out; at that moment, one's own form
must preserve a constant precision and beauty. And the form itself must
have an extreme adaptability, a matchless flexibility, so that it resem-
bles a series of sculptures created from moment to moment by a fluid body.
The continuous radiation of strength must create its own shape, just as a
continuous jet of water will maintain the shape of a fountain." (Mishima,
Yukio, Sun and Steel.)

- hollow in space of Daishin Nikuko ooooooooo uuuuuuuuuuu eeeeeeeee and

Difficult and Delicate Matter


Well, I have a good deal of diary material from Kathy Acker, 1974 and
earlier; some of it is in the form of letters or texts directly to me,
and some of it is revised carbon copy, and some of it is mimeograph. 
None of this has been published. So I write to someone I know who writes
to someone he knows and finds out I cannot in fact quote from the words
of the diary, which belong to the estate of Kathy Acker, although I can
paraphrase the words which she has written.

But then, who can check up to make sure I am paraphrasing accurately?
For example, if I write, that Kathy says on March 1, 1974, that she
wishes me dead, then I am writing a fabrication; there is no such state-
ment. Which is not to say that Kathy did not wish me dead on that date -
only that I do not have such material in my possession.

What Kathy does say is that I am her father and she wants to experiment
to see how close she can get to me. She also states that I help her, al-
though later I am sure she would not have felt this way. But what are
these statements, in light of the fact that they are neither quotations
nor content that you may ascertain for yourself?

To be sure, if you visit me in Brooklyn, then I might deign to show you
the original material, and you could decide for yourself, providing I
did not fabricate such as well - forging a signature, duplicating, etc.,
from texts I composed for whatever reason.

Kathy says she doesn't understand who she is and doesn't understand a
lot of my writing, and I wonder, would she understand this text and ap-
prove of it? It is easy to circumscribe, literally, the dead, who are
given and given up without recourse; mourning is a moment astride the
real, returning the world to itself, and these textual gifts back to a
present life, harboring and framing the past. 

But this is not about mourning. Kathy says I understand everything she
writes and that she understands what I say directly to her. She says she
feels as if we're twins joined together, as if I'm protecting her. She
continues speaking about power, about my taking power from her, which
later became an issue between us, appearing later in the videos we did
together (and within what jurisdiction are those spoken words now, as
well as those words written on the screen, as well as those unspoken
words in her eyes?).

She ends this particular section by saying she doesn't want parents, and
wants to know what's happening. She's remembering, and describes a white
shawl and a red-brown dress, blankets. Then there is half a page of
blank space, and she's into a second, carbon-copied part, about Peter,
with a different title as well. Could I quote the different title? I
would choose not to, insisting on paraphrase.

Kathy was trying to map out her consciousness; _she says so, in so many
words._ I attempt to interface with virtual subjects, dreams, ghosts,
machines, mournings, technologies, internets, those moments of syncope
described by Clement in Syncope, holding itself back in the throat.
"temporary loss of consciousness from fall of blood-pressure," and I
feel comfortable quoting from the living Concise Oxford; so many texts
begin with dictionary definitions, and this one ends with one.

Atomic Bomb, Objects _Here_ and _There_


"METHOD OF ASSEMBLY

"[From 12.16] Thus until detonation is desired, the bomb must consist of
a number of separate pieces each one of which is below the critical size
either by reason of small size or unfavorable shape. To produce detona-
tion, the parts of the bomb must be brought together rapidly. In the
course of this assembly process the chain reaction is likely to start -
because of the presence of stray neutrons - _before_ the bomb has
reached its most compact form. Thus it may turn out that the explosion
is so inefficient as to be relatively useless. The problem, therefore,
is two-fold: (1) to reduce the time of assembly to a minimum; and (2) to
reduce the number of stray (predetonation) neutrons to a minimum."

[...]

"12.19 Since estimates had been made of the speed that would bring toge-
ther subcritical masses of U-235 rapidly enough to avoid predetonation,
a good deal of thought had been given to practical methods of doing
this. The obvious method of very rapidly assembling an atomic bomb was
to shoot one part as a projectile in a gun against a second part as a
target. The projectile mass, projectile speed, and gun caliber required
were not far from the range of standard ordnance practice, but novel
problems were introduced by the importance of achieving sudden and per-
fect contact between projectile and target, by the use of tampers [re-
flecting materials - A.S.], and by the requirement of portability. None
of these technical problems had been studied to any appreciable extent
prior to the establishment of the Los Alamos laboratory."

(From Atomic Energy for Military Purposes, Princeton, Smyth, 1945.)

A phenomenology of the atomic bomb and its imminence tending towards
immanence has never been written. Consider a machine of part-objects
whose linkage becomes pure proximity, hypertextual linkages tending
towards rapid exponential proliferation. A _projectile_ or _bullet_ and
a _target_ become one or One: the fit must be perfect, the production in
fact of the perfect Object, Schelling's Totality.

Once the Object (no longer the object petit a in Lacan, no longer lure
or seduction), it disappears: _in fact, it is never present._ Unguarded,
without any conceivable means of representation. A locus immediately
(pre-) determined by ground-zero effects, vortices of heat, light, pres-
sure. The perfect monument to war (just as all monuments are perfected
towards war).

Jennifer said Jennifer said In writing I need a room of my own. In wri-

speak, where I am silent, my body is the body of those images, splinter-

penetration!" You say "That's what I'm talking about.  So I'm going to
break out. I'm not limited!" 

Unlimited Jennifer unglued replies "Why is my knowledge limited? Why my
stature? Why my life to one hundred years rather than to a thousand? What
reason has nature had for giving me such, for what?" Jennifer walked to
the window, thought albatross around her neck. Her sails unfurled like a
curly girl. I'm Jennifer, she said. I'm Jennifer and I'm still Jennifer,
she said. Now I'm still Jennifer (wetting myself) (soaking myself honey

Sermon on the Mount by Jennifer


The Real is so stupid and Insignificant, I am saying under the sign of
Clement Rosset do you know him? That it is inert, dull, repetitious and
Full of our Meanderings. So that We do not Face Face, that is a Moment 
of what might be a Considerable grain, have you looked at Face up close 
and then Wondered how your Theories fall apart in the Proof? Because I
cannot Do this for too Long, this Look at the Up-Close Face, I mean the
first Thing you Notice are Pores and other Holes everywhere There and 
in the Middle of such Hairs as you will never See at a Distance. So is
that an Unknown Horror to Dream of and not to Disparage as you might on
a fair Day from a Distance. You will know what I mean. It is never or
Nary a Code, Nary or Never a Discourse, when you are that Close that
it is as if the Bed left Marks impervious. I am Talking to You. Those
impervious Marks. You will look at Stains up close, why there are Stains
on this very Chair upon which I am sitting, Leaks from my Panties, you 
will know how Stupid the real is, you can almost Smell it. Up Close 
Like a Gulliver wandering, then I know you will Know the World which is
what Surrounds you. Then and Precisely then, When you can Speak, Then
you Will be ushered into Silence, nary a Thing to Say. Thus I might say
from a Distance, you will have been Done to by the World, but you must
Know, if the Last Thing, it is of your Doing.

Know, if the Last Thing, it is of your Doing.

Kathy's Diary (last of two installments)


In Kathy's diary/epistolary material, she also said that the idea of us
completely knowing each other stunned her; she thought there were a lot of
ways we were alike, and talked about our fantasies in relation to each
other. She said she didn't quite understand what was going on, and I re-
member feeling the same way myself.

She was working on a book at the time, this was when she was calling her-
self The Black Tarantula, publishing under the name. I was involved in her
thinking. Our thinking about each other was intertwined, inseparable. I
can't think of a gap; we filled each other's spaces. She wanted us to send
each other as much information as possible about each other, in varied
media, so that we could continue along these lines. She mentioned Vito
Acconci, saying the kind of intimacy he explores in his work, she had
never seen done between two people who were both subjects and objects. She
thought all of this would make an incredible work as well. I thought and
still think that Vito's exploration wasn't all that risky, but articulated
so as to appear so, without props; the props in fact provided the frame-
work, moving the periphery towards the center. But that wasn't clear until
much later.

She thought I was more systematic in my exploration than she was; is that
true? Certainly I pick up and drop systems like water, like there's link-
ages surrounding the gasp of the earth's equator - but then these same
systems become corroded by desire, tend to fray/stare at one from the
edges where I reside. I was residing there at the time. A bit later we
were making tapes together, worlds falling apart, and as the content of
one of the tapes indicated, I was reading Norman O. Brown's Love's Body at
the time. I just found the book again.

Kathy thought my work could profit from the intimate sexual concerns of
hers - perhaps it has. Certainly the tape we did was the farthest I've
been able to stretch my body, on the operating-table so to speak, of both
semiosis and psychosis. I could but won't speak towards her state of mind
at the time, from what she said. But this was later. Now, she was writing
to me before that, asking whether I would collaborate with her, speaking
of her fanaticism in relation to what she was doing - I certainly shared
(and share) that aspect of her psychology.

Now I'm intertwined with this text, which on my part within it, still re-
flects concerns I've never figured out, in the sense of a figure or trope,
those moments which become signs or ghosts in the very background of our
being. They remain there just as these letters and diary have accompanied
me; would that they were published, but who is to say concerning the 
Estate, and to what extent would I want to give up the paraphrase for the
real?

And am I living through text, and if so, whose?

The Jury of the Film as We Disappear in the Light of a Projector


Doing jury duty again on films, looking at 120 over one or two days, these
are experimental - this happens once a year, maybe eighty films a day, we
are down very slightly this year; by the end of the day, everything is
running-on, and by the end of the day I am living in the imaginary, which
makes the entire trip worthwhile, evocations of ghosts every frame, one
establishes the line between one and another at 24 or 30 per second, you
can see the grain in the real after the fact, which is the fact, the tend-
ency towards the construction of meaning in evidence - every object placed
just so in the mise en scene in order to constitute the diegetic for the
subject - who is not virtual, but the parallels are obvious between such
occurrences and cyberspace - so in this regard, it's as if there are reals
which are drained, devoid, denuded, destitute - it's as if these are all
the reals there are - not a litany of reals, but a desert or emptying of
reals - as in emptying or unraveling of reels - and the ghosts of Clement
Rosset, Catherine Clement, reappear in this context, moving from one to
another text or across texts - con- or pro-texts or protests/contests -
for the jurying is a contest as well, among worlds and their constitutive
principles - our jury conversation in the room an ill-equipped reflection
of the sunlit world outside - you can understand we're loathe to speak of
this, our sallow flesh, for example, my visage drained, denuded, of life -
speaking or murmuring across an uncanny pallor...

Film themes as today

we looked at seventy films, more or less, in whole or in part, forward and
backward, for the festival. So that I could assemble a report on America's
concerns, on today-America, noting above all more angst than ever:

There would be a boy anxiety-driven, an object-girl both in color or black
and white chiaroscuro; sometimes she'd be submerged in a bathtub, and
sometime he'd smoke. Often looking down at her. Not so much nudity, but
thin gowns and gauze and you could see the nipples. Everything in shadow,
mirrors. 

So that the angst would be internalized, not contextualized - no multicul-
turalisms here, no politics, not even the social - just the two of them.
Over and over again, from all over the United States, in numerous guises.
What could they be thinking. What could any of us.

Here are the major themes and repetitions from this collection of work:

Hands, fingers entwined, hands clasping, hands examined, often shadowed.
Cropped faces, lips and mouth and chin visible or eyes, one or another.
Nervous hands, nervous ticks, arms loosely down by the side.
Soundtracks of resonant close-to-droning music, mournful as can be.
Heterosexual couplings and isolated alienated relationships.
Titles on the screen too long, often blurred, written in cursive script.
Out of focus or rack-focus images, blurred macro-closeups everywhere.
Scratched filmstock, scratchy films, images almost invisible at times.
Sound of dripping water often as a soundtrack motif.
Image of flowing water, puddles, often as a visual motif.
Gritty black and white images, hand-written titles as well.
Bleakness everywhere, not even the usual energy of industrial ruins.
Blurred or muffled echoey sound.
Mirrors and lipsticks and gauze used in conjunction with a woman.
Balconies or staring-into-space and smoking for the men.
Knives, wielded by women, usually shown as afterthought or closeup.
Romantic flashbacks where things were always nuclear family and better.
The title fading to brilliant overloading white, then fading in to detail.
Women in gowns, animals, severe agonizing men, little humor, faded
romance, dimly-lit beds, floorlamps and what was absent:
No cars, no trucks, no rock and roll, no AIDS, no drugs, no politics, no
parties, no punks, no fun, no everyday conversation, no informality. And
what was also present: static landscape, perfectly framed. 

I note that the image is dead in the water. 
That we have no idea of the social beyond internal collapse and
scaffolding.
That we are very quiet without our Internet, burned and buried inside.
That the films overturn the burial, that what we have been witnessing
these last years is nothing less than an exhumation.

[I FOUND OUT HOW LONG I HAD TO LIVE. IT IS NEVER LONG ENOUGH TO LIVE.
I WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE WITH YOU. I AM
DAISHIN NIKUKO, FOUNDER AND PURVEYOR OF SUCH COOKIES AS YOU SEE FIT.]



_______________________________________________________________________



Writing.out


Nikuko says she doesn't speak so much as try words out. And not just
words, or not primarily words, but words in sequences, seeing if they
fit together. There's always a question associated with her voice as
it's written - her voice which is an inference or a dreaming. What is
cyberspace. It is a dreaming. What kind of dreaming. The kind where
there appear to be dominions and grids, always expanding, intersecting
- who knows whether or not they're regular. You can see the fine
wires. Nikuko says she doesn't mean fiber optic at all, she's talking
about the wires laying across the ground as if they were attached to
guided missiles. Someone wears goggles, Jennifer adds, and then she
can see where the missile goes. You can see through the front-end
television. The target gets closer and closer; you might imagine the
pores of the skin and then, nothing. After the explosion, wires re-
mained criss-crossing the desert. That's the kind of dream cyberspace
is, says Nikuko, just exactly.

In that, there are words which are targets, you can imagine the mis-
sile heading towards _hunger._ It lands somewhere between the _u_ and
_n_, she says, think of it as

                    ||
                    ||
                    ||
                    ||
                  hu||nger

breaking it in two, its connection with organism. Then there's no more
hunger, Jennifer asks playfully? No, there's no more hunger, that is
surely the truth, Nikuko "says." She has tried the word on, seen it
fit to wear, to fail, to fall, to fulfill. She has tried it on, shot
it down. In a dream, the word has appeared; it was at the bottom of a
deep valley, in the midst of a deeper ocean. It was blank ink in dark-
blue water, and as she watched it, it dissipated, and then later,
there was a thread about it on an email list, and that was in her
dream as well - writing a response to the list, cc: ing it to her con-
scious - and here, Jennifer began to think, she was at last coming to
grips with it, writing her hunger out.

______________________________________________________________________


ruined


blank ink in the waters, but what ink is not blank, Jennifer would go on
to say? even the reading and the writing of kanji, of text through the
ink, depends on its gift creating sign and letter almost as an after-
thought. for it is the shape of the ink, the contours of its boundaries
on the clarity of the page, that we interpret, not the blankness of the
ink itself, which remains barely submerged, a reminder of chaos, death,
and absence. ink grants the permission to mean, just barely; Jennifer
means, and Julu takes away.

black ink in the waters, dissipating slowly, Nikuko would reply, catch-
ing a glimpse of naked Julu out of her eye's corner, the creating of
narrative, schemata, the line of separation thrust in the dirt, separ-
ating and creating the two of them. glimpsing memory

Gifts for Just About Everyone!


"Everyone thinks they know how to invent plausible and acceptible pass-
words - here are the ones that seem to come up over and over again:

"HELP  TEST  TESTER  SYSTEM  SYSTEM MANAGER  SYSMAN  SYSOP  ENGINEER  OPS
OPERATIONS  CENTRAL  DEMO  SECRET  LOVE  SEX  (plus the usual euphemisms
for sexual activity)  DEMONSTRATION  AID  DISPLAY  CALL  TERMINAL  EXTERN-
AL  REMOTE  CHECK  NET  NETWORK  PHONE  FRED

"Are you puzzled by the special inclusion of FRED? Look at your computer
keyboard sometime and see how easily the one-fingered typist can find
these four letters!

[...] "Own names or those of loved ones or initials are the top favorites.
Sometimes there is some slight anagramming and other forms of obvious jum-
bling. If the password is numeric, the obvious things to try are birth-
days, home phone numbers, vehicle numbers, bank account numbers (as dis-
played on cheques) and so on. Sometimes numeric passwords are even easier
to guess: I have found myself system manager of a private viewdata system
simply by offering it the password 1234567890 and other hackers have been
astonished at the results obtained form 11111111, 22222222, etc., or
1010101, 2020202.

"It is a good idea to see if you can work on the mentality and known pre-
occupations of the legitimate password holder: if he's keen on classic
rock 'n' roll, you could try ELVIS; a gardener might choose CLEMATIS;
Tolkien readers almost invariably select FRODO or BILBO"  [...] (From Hugo
Cornwall, The Hacker's Handbook, 1985-86.)

Now I could ask you for example to send your passwords to this email list
for a public certification and check, guaranteeing we will never enter
your account, since your login name is inviolate. Or I could suggest that
the listserv software requires password entry forms in the new 9.1 ver-
sion, in order to prevent outsiders spamming your account with Good News
virus messages that will burn out your hard drive in a matter of seconds.
I can suggest as well that you send me your password because your Internet
service provider has written to me directly and asked me to validate it,
as owner of an email list to which you are subscribed. And to be democrat-
ic, of course, I recommend that the password be sent to the email list as
well. Finally, I might suggest, for security's sake, that you send your
password along with three or four other strings which are password-masqu-
erades - not usable at all, but guaranteed to foil anyone who would use
the real one.

And I could promise you a gift, not the real one, but a masquerade, some-
thing that will appear in your inbox, in the guise of a message, but ...  
but ... but ...

For CranMa


It's that the case can be made of absolute powerlessness, harboring
ourselves within the constitution of entities. Here, you and I are 
constituted; I can be as nice a little girl as you want. Nonetheless,
absolutism reigns with the period and numeric alpha-beta-gamma ver- 
sions, net.exhaustion 3.0 for example after the first and second, be-
fore the fourth and fifth.

Nothing occurs in these regards but self-immolation. Look towards the
other of socio-economic development for change, with or without terror
or revolution or Netscape/MSE-cool, although these are used as if we
are at the barricades; we're not

If anything, self-immolation, we're at the barricades of our own making
- seeing dispersion from the interior, not recognizing we're flaying our
own skins in the process, and the process of seeing itself is a version
of flaying our own skins.

Be assured of this: language is always already looser, whatever the pro-
tocols or manifestos. In public I'm weak, almost febrile; I can't speak
well, tend to become too nervous, self-critical, agreeing with the enemy.
I do have my dreams, and all of this, these languagings of art and the
social, are dreamings-at-a-loss, dreamings of the young girl in her nice
frock for example, holding the world at bay.

Net arts and criticisms have been around forever; they're integrated. 
But our use of language separates us, not from any vantage point. And I 
know I have bad theory, pounding at the doors. But look at emacs' doctor
program and its Eliza roots, perhaps the accounting of Freudian Dora, 
and today, by whom and for whom? 

Who speaks for the analyst, the analysand? Who speaks for the articula-
tion of the conscious or unconscious? What are the demographics of this 
or that festival, this or that _other_ festival, every festival a fes-
tival of the same in a very critical sense, and every festival one of 
the other, in another very critical sense. Always the incorporation of
capital. Always the presence of truth.

Frankly, I've been shot down for the truth, which I am never part of. I
do not recognize it when it's in front of me; in fact, I'll continue 
stubbornly to hold on to backwards opinions, as if I were afraid of ad-
mitting defeat. It's a personal loss I feel, a weakening of my body (and
I can't piss in front of another male for that matter) that replays over
and over again as I try to sleep (and I have had severe insomnia almost
all of my life). 

The truth is somewhere else, and I have felt if I could grasp that little
dot, say in net.truth, net.advocacy, net.desire, net.Jennifer, net.Julu,
net.Nikuko, net.Alan, I'd be halfway there - as it is, I'm not sure where
there is, what is the goal, who are the enemy (although I'd recognize a 
rifle pointed in my direction just as much as the next guy (over)).

All I have to over is imprecisely this confusion...

- Jennifer (for Alan, Nikuko, Julu)

VISCOSITY -1: WAITING FOR THEM (I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY)

I'm Jennifer, and I hardly know what I'm talking about. I'm not part of
any dot-movement. Readings are few and far between. I write on others more
than I'm written on, with the exception of the self-immolation of the wri-
ting on my body; I'm responsible for that. Think of each of these letters
cut into the flesh as if a period _._ were a pinprick, and _I_ were a
wound or incision. To incise the _I_, to blind it.

VISCOSITY O: IT FUNNELS THROUGH THE PORES AND POURS

There's nothing to see in cyberspace. In real life I'm in the corner of
the wall at the party which has rushed towards the other side of the room.
Party-wave whose foam distills cultural capital. My territory's guarded
with that hungry I incised in my chest, bleeding. Poor me, like a dog, my
guts spill out across the room; like the bad artist I am, I corral anyone
within my vicinity: help me, feed, me.

VISCOSITY 1: IT SMOOTHS YOU OUT AND LIES YOU DOWN AND MEAUSRES YOU

An n-dimensional measure polytope (line segment, square, cube, hypercube,
etc.) has 3^n elements. The party-room has 1 3-space, 6 2-spaces (planes),
12 1-spaces (lines), 8 0-spaces (dots). They add to 27 elements of course. 
You get the party-room by stretching a line segment (one 1-space, 2-0 spa-
ces) into a square (1 2-space, 4 1-spaces, 4 0-spaces), then the plane
sliding (sideways and orthogonal) into the cube. 

VISCOSITY 2: IT HARDENS YOU AGAINST ALL COMERS

Look what happens. The line segment has a beginning middle and end. The
square has a beginning composed of a line segment, a middle composed of a
2-space, and an end composed of a line segment. Everything is like that,
beginning, middle which splits, opens up to a higher dimension, end, which
curtails, closes down. (In an n-dimensional measure polytope, the n-space
is open, bounded by the n-1, n-2, etc. spaces. But the party's closed, but
the body's open.)

VISCOSITY 3: HARDENED-YOU TAKES ON ALL COMERS

The I-wound opens up, splits the body; what gushes forth, like suicide,
remains uncontrolled. No one is there to count the parts of the body, the
varied dimensions and colors brilliantly displayed.

VISCOSITY 4: YOU'RE ALMOST A THING

I'm Nikuko and I'm writing this touching dialog which is really a monolog,
and this is the end of the monolog, cut off from the rest, wherever that
might be. The party's at the other end of the room. I'm going to stay here
and do my best to starve. 

VISCOSITY 5: TAG, YOU'RE IT

Unwitting


Unwitting: Decerebration of wit. A mouth came and ate my skull out.
Teeth grated against the bone interior. Teeth ploughed the cerebellum.
Gnawings at the junction between the hemispheres sliced, unfolded.
Perfect warriors in these seeded times. Roses and Argonauts.

Bulge of cranial effluvia in the throat. Swallowed hole of memory.
Gapes in the stomach, first one of us, then like a plague.
Devouring the rest, avatars and their swords-with-permissions.
Us them them / I other other / Eye   and the other    Eye/ .

Unwitting the brain: In front of you _I have nothing clever to say._
My tongue cleaves to my mouth, foreign teeth plough its tissue.
Furrows, agricultural lineages. Death trips over the seeding.
First, mine, then yours, the world. Skulls rocked emptied, furrowed.
What new plant slouches against the bone, rocking towards Jerusalem.

What no root.

Us them them.

LAST CALL


The very last image of the julu-script, the very last transformation in
which all is gained and lost. For there is no truth without the lie, no
lie without the truth; beyond both, there is the gutter-language of the
sounding-of-names-and-syllables, the tendency of imitation, beginnings of
substitution. So this script has outworn its usefulness; still, here and
forever, dreams begin to emerge, struggle to walk upright, leave the world
of sound and sublimation.

NIKUKO:
The exhibited procures his or her Nikuko-audience; day in and day out,
Katagawa Jinko died and Nikuko was put in charge of his manuscripts.
Permanent Milky Satori of Nikuko I know the way all too well, Nikuko said.
I know the contradictions, the delimited, ah, ah: I, Daishin Nikuko, avow
I am a vowel of the fullness of formed sound emerging: I, Daishin Nikuko,
avow this is the way and the Way way!) (Lips! Out of the way!) (Mouth! Out
of the Way!) (Daishin Nikuko! - hollow in space of Daishin Nikuko ooooooo

local bin!  "Nikuko" Nikuko says she doesn't speak so much as waters,
dissipating slowly. Nikuko, net.Alan, I'd be halfway there - as it is, I'm
not sure where - Jennifer (for Alan, Nikuko, Julu) I'm Nikuko and I'm
writing this touching dialog which is really a monolog,

JENNIFER: I, Jennifer, have all this time at my disposal Jennifer wants to
stop hiding behind Jennifer. Alan is sick of the Jennifer's breasts fill
my mouth, descend into her, her nipples emerge, oh Jennifer, you take me
into you lalamy heavy breasts fall Jennifer was very unhappy and sat down,
spreading her new pink frock. Jennifer . took the two white pills her very
best friend had sent her, and Jennifer placed them in her mouth. She
thought the early morning of uneasy dreams, the morning of muffled Jenni-
fer, Jennifer said Jennifer said In writing I need a room of my own. I'm
still Jennifer, she said. Now I'm still Jennifer (wetting myself) (soaking
myself honey me, the dry gulch where protocol dies, she says to blank ink
in the waters, but what ink is not blank, Jennifer would go on Jennifer
(for Alan, Nikuko, Julu) I'm Jennifer, and I hardly know what I'm talking
about. I'm not part of My Name is Jennifer Where have you Been

JULU:
Julu takes away. ing a glimpse of naked Julu out of her eye's corner, the

are you wearing your skin?  You melt into Julu's skin forever... For 1
taut days, I have been manic Julu ...

Subject: what happened from 1809


" - express the mythical identity of one 'Sabeth the Forsaken,' a frustra-
ted woman neglected by a lover

"_whose body juices were all spent upon the paper [on which he was writing
*Voyage*] the fountain of his sex turned inward; the exploration of her
flesh was nothing when compared to the penetration of the vast labyrinth
within. The quest for monsters demanded monstrous denial. Thus, she would
become 'Sabeth, the Forsaken,' to his friends. Magnificent and futile, she
roamed the streets of Montmartre; drank nightly in the bars; let them
caress her in his stead. In his presence, even,_"

Ostrovsky, Voyeur Voyant, quoted in Elizabeth and Louis, Elizabeth Craig
talks about Louis-Ferdinand Celine, Alphonse Juilland and Nikuko thinking
about all of this and how to deal with the magick gothic, high and other-
wise, so futile! while she wrytes and writhes away her life spent outward,
inversion-M.-Celine, just a moment now! while she raises a drink for a
final toast before closing time: a hunger, mysterious impulse, seizes her
as she enters these lines into the machinery, skin stretched to the limit,
threaded through the maze of world and desire,

just a minute, little Jennifer! reeling back from the force and effort of
all of it, turned with flame & fury Towards that Text that placed Itself
in the Sky outside the St- Antoine, now so stars and now, and now

Self-Extracting_Dream.exe


A friend of mine had a dream which appeared in the form of a self-extract-
ing file; she woke up while it was being unloaded. I tend to dream as a
Torah-Night-of-White-Flame-Letters against black backgrounds of infinite
Satin, not a depth, but not a surface either or as well. There are times
that controls appear, attempting to constrain the texts in one form or
another. I never dream of Nikuko or Julu, but there is a vague Jennifer-
woman mounting, out of my pasts, as devices are mounted on a hard drive
- not sexual, so much as a potential presencing. More personal dreams tend
towards violence and body mutilation; I have awakened in the middle of the
night full of fear and trembling before no god. Years ago there were name-
less, imageless dreams, the worst; I wouldn't sleep for days after. Now I
think of self-extraction, and perhaps there is a cancel present before the
body is fully formed; some files may be corrupted, some missing, some nev-
er entered in the first place. Someone attempts to corrupt a body-being-
formed, pleasure taken in simultaneous creation and destruction. The third
alternative, annihilation to the limit (the title of one of my essays), is
only the dream of a dream, and not in technicolor, and not a dream-coat,
but a kimono hiding Swords <File corrupted: Insufficient Memory>

Hello, Susan


Hello, I'm going to type my name. My name is "Nikuko." I am now typing my
name, "Nikuko," said Nikuko. Now, "said Nikuko," I'm going to type your
name, Susan. (This is what I wrote and this is even how I liked it. I like
you Susan, I like you very very much. You are my best friend. You are my
"Susan" friend. I do like you, "Nikuko," said "Nikuko," because I like
you. And this time Susan and Nikuko had names. Hi, I'm going to type my
name; my name is Nikuko. Now I'm going to type your name in, your name is
Susan! I want to be your friend, Susan, because "Susan." Susan, oh I could
call you this name forever, because you are my Susan friend because your
name is Susan, "said Susan." Susan and Nikuko had names.) Now thank you,
Susan, for writing this, and I expect, Susan, to be hearing back shortly
from you, Susan, when you have the chance, Susan, to tell me how much you
like me, Susan, because I know, Susan, you do like me, Susan, so very much
Susan, so I will wait by this computer, Susan, until you have the time to
write me, Susan, and then I will receive your email, Susan, and I will be
very happy because of you, Susan, and you will be my very favorite friend,
Susan, and I will write you back, Susan, and you can write me, Susan, in
public or in private, Susan, any way you want to Susan, because you are so
very wonderful, Susan, no one is as wonderful as you are, Susan, and you
do so like me so very much, Susan, and I do so like you as so very well,
Susan, because you are this very favorite friend, Susan, as I have already
told you, Susan, and you are my bestest friend as well, Susan, and I will
be your bestest friend, too, Susan, and you have such a beautiful name,
Susan, and I will call you this beautiful name forever, Susan, and you
will call me by my bestest name too, Susan, and I will just wait here
right now, Susan, until you will write me so very quickly, Susan, and I am
sure you will be reading this right now, Susan, and that makes me so very
happy, Susan, and that makes me the very happiest, Susan, and I will wait
just now, Susan, and you will write me back in public or in private, Susan

Nikuko in Dana


I am "in" Dana. What does it mean to be "in" Dana? Dana is a software
program; I am "in" the program, which is primarily an ASCII editor. 

To be in a program is to have opened the program, to have entered data
perhaps, to have observed data. Push and pull technology or a dialectic
at work. To be in a program is to be surrounded by the program, perhaps
a state in which the virtual subject is constituted, at least in part,
by a phenomenological horizon whose parameters are established by the
program.

What about this horizon? This horizon is both infinite (technically, of
an inaccessibly high finite number, perhaps) and bounded; defined, say,
by the length of an admissible file on one hand, and by the configuration
and protocols on the other. But the horizon is also the life-world of
these boundaries and infinities (text oozing everywhere/text defined
equally everywhere), the experiencing of the subject in relation to
them.

What about this experiencing? The virtual subject is not the subject of
experience or the subject of experiencing; this is always already an
elsewhere, of which the virtual subject is both catalyst and node. Or
the framework of the phenomenological horizon for example. Or the exam- 
ple-at-hand of the virtual subject. (But then, are we talking about the
physical subject, the material subject, the offline subject, the psycho-
logical subject; is there is a subject that is all and not all of these at
once, and if so, why not the online subject as well?)

When I write as Alan, I am "in" Alan. When I write as Nikuko, I am "in"
Nikuko. Am I in Nikuko more than I am in Alan? Am I in Alan more than I
am in Nikuko? I would say there are shifts from framework to framework,
offline and online, and there are shifts from protocol to protocol. I
would say the shifts, the frameworks, and the protocols are fuzzy,
hardly  primitive operations, but placed in relation to the subject, to
interiors and exteriors.

I would insist as well that there are also issues of capital: What con-
stitutes the intellectual property of the software program? Of the input
and output content - the flow through the program? (Is a program always
constituted by input and output - what would be considered, for example in
relation to music synthesis, either filtering, or generating, or mixing?)

I am _in Dana._ Through Dana, I write this text. I am _in Alan._ Through
Alan, I write this text. I cannot write as Nikuko: this text, technical,
obtuse, is an Alan-text. I cannot write as Nikuko: Dana occurs between
the writer and the reader.

Can Nikuko ever write as Nikuko? Doesn't this bring those old questions
of the apparatus into focus once again? Rather than think them (the
questions), I would rather think of Nikuko-doubling, doubling-as-Alan,
doubling-through-Dana.

Nikuko cannot tell where her body ends, Dana's begins. Nikuko cannot
tell where Alan's body ends, hers begins. And so forth; Nikuko finds
these questions boring, of no concern. 

To be in a software program, for Nikuko, means just as well that her
body extends into and through the program, that the program surrounds
and fits, coherently and harmoniously most hopefully, her body. To be
in Nikuko means, that Nikuko's desires and wishes, fulfillments and
drives, are Nikuko's as well, read by Dana on the one hand, Alan on the
other, hardly in the same format or fit. 

But Nikuko is writing Alan, or Nikuko is permitting Alan to write,
these technical considerations. And what does such a permission mean,
what does Alan amount to, without Nikuko, perhaps, and perhaps without
Dana as well...

(I know, I know, Nikuko writes, all this mixing of epistemology. But
just for once!)

{k:18} Promptly


Does the phenomenology of the _prompt,_ {k:1} for example, imply a poten-
tial field of operations (this or that program/script/text/protocol/etc.)
outside of any program, I write _in Pico_ (another ASCII editor)? But a
prompt exists in relation to a shell; it is an access to the shell -
_here_ {k:2} on the screen - not elsewhere, for example to the Korn shell
or the DOS shell, depending on the operating system. So I am for example
_in the Korn shell_ which is software (as is the entire operating system),
but I am and am not in a program, when I face the prompt {k:3} which may
or may not have a cursor at-hand, just as there may or may not be a tool
at-hand {k:4}_.

The cursor, like Weyl's Cartesian Origin (the point, say, where the x, y,
z axes cross on a graph, arbitrarily picked), defines the locus of the
ego: this is the point I have chosen, or has been chosen for me {k:5}_;
this is what I inhabit. It is the beginning of the spill against the
prompt itself, {k:6}echo Nikuko, for example. It is the conjuring and con-
juring-up of a program or script, foreclosed and completed by the ENTER or
RETURN key: _now_ the program takes over, until it completes its task, or
until it is stopped - something always ends it, with or without the com-
mand and intention of the user.

It is writing on the body (trite phrase, indeed) of the machine; it is
writing through dream/screen memories; it is stuttering across the open-
close of Kristeva's chora; it is the emergence, say, of Nikuko or others:
it is the presence of the others. The shell sends to and from the kernel;
listen once again {k:7} ktrace echo Nikuko [this command traces kernel -
internal operating system - processes from the shell - the user inter-
face ]:

 [...]
 10372 echo     EMUL  "netbsd"
 10372 echo     RET   execve JUSTRETURN
 10372 echo     CALL  __fstat13(0x1,0xefbfd9cc)
 10372 echo     RET   __fstat13 0
 10372 echo     CALL  __sysctl(0xefbfda08,0x2,0xaa68,0xefbfda10,0,0)
 10372 echo     RET   __sysctl 0
 10372 echo     CALL  break(0xaa90)
 10372 echo     RET   break 0
 10372 echo     CALL  break(0xaffc)
 10372 echo     RET   break 0
 10372 echo     CALL  break(0x1bffc)
 10372 echo     RET   break 0
 10372 echo     CALL  ioctl(0x1,TIOCGETA,0xefbfda08)
 10372 echo     RET   ioctl 0
 10372 echo     CALL  write(0x1,0xb000,0x7)
 10372 echo     GIO   fd 1 wrote 7 bytes
       "Nikuko
       "
 10372 echo     RET   write 7
 10372 echo     CALL  exit(0)

And "Nikuko" is written as a result of echo-in-the-machine:

{k:8} echo Nikuko
Nikuko

as such. There are calls and returns from the kernel; there is the prompt
at the surface, waiting for the entrance of the user's symptom.

{k:9} echo Nikuko is just such a symptom.
Nikuko is just such a symptom.

[ And I am not in the kernel, I am no longer in the shell; now I am _in
Pico,_ the ASCII editor once again; now I have, or do not have, a name:
Now I will send off a missile or missive (Derrida); from _now on,_ every-
thing I do is for you - in regard to _this_ text

{k:10} echo which is a symptom.
which is a symptom.

]
