(Intro, Twista)
Yeah, it's a Chi-Town remix

(Hook, Twista)
This is why I'm cold (Cold)
This is why I'm cold (Cold)
This is why-this is why
This is why I'm cold (Cold)
This is why I'm cold (Cold)
This is why I'm cold (Wooo!)
This is why-this is why
This is why I'm cold (Cold)
I'm cold cause I'm hot (Hot)
You ain't cause you not (Not)
This is why-this is why
This is why I'm cold (Cold)
I'm cold cause I'm hot (Hot)
You ain't cause you not (Not)
This is why-this is why
This is why I'm cold (Cold)

(Verse 1, Twista)
This is why I'm cold
Cause I'm a chain flicka
I could sell a million
Just by tellin 'em its Twista
I represent the Mid-West
This is where it's at
Where Common and Nelly and Eminem and Kanye West
We got that crack
I love the dirty
Cause the trap remind me of K-Town
Full of sheisty ass niggas
But the true ones gon' stay down
But on the East-Coast they want lyrics in the do'
So I get up in the middle of the sight ful
Then I (Spit another flow)
And when I hit the West
I blow 'sess everyday
Get up with showski of fourty
When I'm in 'Frisco water bay
And when I'm in L.A. 
I get up with Snoop and The Game
In a lot full of sixty fo's
Red and blue all on them thangs
And when I'm in the Chi
It's Crucial or Do or Die
Come and walk with the god
Take a journey, just you and I
They asked me to shake it for 'em
So they can take a glance
It's get money game mobstas
Gangstas don't dance

(Hook)

(Verse 2, R. Kelly)
This is why I'm Kels (Whoa)
This is why I'm Kels (Whoa)
This is why-this is why
This is why I'm Kels (Whoa)
I'm Kels cause I'm hot (Yup)
You ain't cause you not (Nope)
This is why-this is why
This is why I'm Kels (Whoa)
Stiff him on the hook (Hey)
This shit is gon' sell (Yup)
This is why-this is why
(This is why I'm Kels)
R and B king, and I'm rollin down ya block (Block)
Hits like a bomb when I let the beat drop (Boooom)
South-side baby, Kels rootin for the Sox
In the club fallin all over muh'fuckas cause I'm intox (Barff)
Girls take me home, cause I'm good on the mattress
Yeah I'm from the hood, but I be pokin these actresses
Moral of the story is cuff yo chick, if she hot
May twenty-ninth, double up (Bitch go cop) Kels

(Hook)

(Verse 3, Liffy Stokes)
This is why I'm cold
Give me some Kush 'Dro
Niggas love Stokes, cause I keep it for the low
Grams or eight-balls, I'm always on-call
I got a little of everything, a one-stop shop-all
Keep a P-95 in my 750-LI
Throw them fo's to the sky, nigga this is why I'm fly
Let the mink sweep the flo', as cold as Chicago
Ground full of snow, table full of snow

(Mayz)
Mayz stay with a gang of niggas, always gettin money
And dare one of you bitch niggas to try to take it from me (Nigga)
This is why I'm cold, I'm always into gold
Sportin chunky ice, when the wind is ten-below (Brrrr)
Always blowin Kush, with some good dope to push
Cause I'm makin dirty money, like that nigga George Bush
Outside, it be freezin, the season is the winter
But I don't give a fuck, I'm out here hustlin in December (Mobstaz)
