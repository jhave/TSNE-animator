(Chali 2na)
Yo, this is a lesson in friendship
The depths of a kinship
What women and men begin with, and then slip
My pen drips
As I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction
Eruption of passion
Corrupts if a lasted friendship's involved
But love to cross the line
But that's why we built these walls

(Hook: Nelly Furtado)
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line

(Akil)
Opposite's attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Tryin not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of y'all
So you respect that
And entertain the idea, but get brought back
To reality, and could you really live with that?
Decision, based on intuition
You love and keep your distance
Hug and kiss in friendship

(Marc 7)
An ongoing kinship, we was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
but your feelings sparked the sentence
Sometimes you're too intense in your quest to invent
The perfect man, please understand, my rhyme is your repent

(Hook) - repeat 2X

(Soup)
Man, too bad that we became friends first
I'm not on expert on how relationships should work
But, (echos) from the minute it as known
It changed the whole tone on how we spoke on the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you, all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune, you let me up in your room. (Damn)
But to me girl, you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted (Yo, whatchu doin after this?)
Infactuation was authentic, but yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe, I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter, then tear it up
Or do a song, just to say what's up
I want ... just ... a touch

(Hook) - repeat 2X

(Nelly Furtado)
I can't do this anymore
See my heart just spills out when you walk in the door
Friendship turns into lust and this only tip
That I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice to these things that I'm feeling
You got someone else, don't wanna be caught stealing
Hell if she knew she would never leave us alone
in the roo-ooo-ooom

(Chali 2na)
This was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first?
And then slip?
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
of devotion

(Akil)
Opposites attract
And best friends make a perfect match
If you only knew that
Once you cross, ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that
That's that

(Marc 7)
We was people to begin with, but you was too relentless
Jeporidizing kinship, respect is intended
Resolve is my intent
While we got it in
I'm tryin to salvage a friendship

(Hook) - repeat 2X</pre>
