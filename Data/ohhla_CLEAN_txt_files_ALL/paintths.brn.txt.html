Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I ain't even close to leaving this house
There's still so many rooms left to cover
And there ain't no reason for you to ever be without
Memories of me and my love

And I want these stairs, those walls
Kitchen counters, and those chairs
To remind you of how good it feels
And all of these floors and ceilings
And every hallway (yeah)
Not and inch will go untouched

Lets paint this house with our love (our love)

I'll just lay while you stroke, you putting it down
Damn you showing all your colors
My wildest thoughts are provoking
Its like you're in my head right now (now, my head)
Cause you know me like no other

And I want these stairs, those walls
Kitchen counters, and those chairs
To remind you of how good it feels
And all of these floors and ceilings
And every hallway (yeah)
Not and inch will go untouched

Lets paint this house with our love (our love)

Our love
Love oh oh
Ooh ooh

Cancel the decorator
We don't need no help
You'll pick out the colors
We'll clean up the mess later
We do it so well
Loving one another
In the closet
On the facets
In the balconies
Anywhere you are inside this house
You'll, think of me yeah yeah yeah

And I want these stairs (stairs), those walls
Kitchen counters, and those chairs (those chairs)
To remind you of how good it feels (good it feels)
And all of these floors and ceilings (floors and ceilings)
And every hallway (yeah yeah yeah)
Not and inch will go untouched

Lets paint this house with our love (our love)
Our Love (our love)
Let's Paint this house with our love (love)
Let's paint this house with our love (our love)</pre>
