[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Hate!
Don't like the way
Don't like the way
Don't like the way you (hate!)
Don't like the way
Don't like the way
Don't like the way you (hate!)

[Madrox]
I'll slap that bitch in the face until she bleeds (hate!)
Beat you down for all the times you cheated me (hate!)
I don't like you
I don't like you
Don't like the way you (hate!)
I don't like you
I don't like you
Don't like the way you (hate!)

[Chorus]

[Monoxide]
It was love at first sight
But now it's just another arguement that turns into a fist fight
And I just might, pick up a pistol and let her have it
Blow her fucking brains all over the kitchen cabinet
Call me a faggot cause I'm hanging with my homies and not you
And your at home feeling lonely, now what ya gonna do?
Call the cops and Imma show you why I'm twisted
I'll straight up leave the precinct shit fried and blisted

[Chorus]

I don't like the way you hate.. when you hate..
I don't like the way you hate.. when you (HATE!)

[Chorus]</pre>
