[Intro: sample of Mike Epps' stand-up from "Under Rated &amp; Never Faded"]
All these lil' young kids, ain't got no direction
Shit, these lil' kids is on everything

[Chorus 2X: Mike Epps sample]
Syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka, huh-huh-huh huh, huh-huh-huh
I'm on everything {*4X*}
I'm on

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm on syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Henna-Henna, sober don't, interest me
I'm on everythi-i-ing
'Bout to sniff the liquor like it's 'ca-a-a-a-aine
That's how high I am - I'm BLOWED!
I take painkillers to ease the pain though I, ain't in pain
No we, ain't the same, you drunk, I'm on everything
Sick when I kick it, gout
Me soberin up, HA~! Alf
Cash rules everything, acid tab, hash, 'shrooms
I done woke up with a fuckin tiger in my bathroom
I am fuckin high {*blablabl*} high
{*blablabl*} high {*blablabl*} high
Menace to society, I feel, sorry for your mother
Me and Vishis on 'shrooms, call us the Mario Brothers
Back down, we never back down
Never laid out, can't put my back down
I'm on

[Chorus] - 1/2X

[Eminem]
Painkillers, I call 'em cane pillars
Cause they hold me up when I take 'em, I need a cane and pillars
I'm on everything - sick when I kick it, BARF
Me soberin up {*fart*} FART!
I'll crush your brain like a pill crusher, let's crush a pill, yeah
Fuck, I think I just crushed my last Tylenol 3 up
Grab the key up off the counter to the camper, left the crib
Man who'da knew that 3 in the mornin I'd still be up?
Could barely see up over the steerin wheel, crash the whip tore a tree up
On my way to the dealers tryin to re-up
Call me Brett Favre, spell it F-A-V-R-E yup
It's wrong, other words I just fucked my RV up!
Bitch it's on again yeah, break that Klonopin in half
while I smoke some chronic in the cab with Donovan McNabb
Then I dye my hair back blonde again and laugh
I'm the real macaroni, you cheesy bitch, I'm demonic with the +Kraft+
There's a devil in my noodle, you? Angel hair pasta
Flow's dreaded like some fuckin tangled hair Rasta-
-farian, Jamaican, relax man
I'll send a fuckin axe at you if you insist on a fuckin ax-sent
Bad and Evil is back with an epidural, check your girl
Cause after we prop you up we're proppin her up
So baby come put your feet up in these stirrups
Your boyfriend better find another fuckin hornet's nest to stir up
We rap like we're on

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm on syrup, painkillers, cigarette, speed
Henna-hen.. heheh! Classic
It's Eminem and him again, my sentiments exactly
I told that bitch to get at me, then the bitch attacked me
Kid you not, I'm lit up as fuck - tablecloth tucked in my pants 
'til I'm hearin dishes drop as I walk away from my +Dinner With Schmucks+

[Eminem]
Then I enter the front of the K-Mart shoppin center 
with a coupon book and a hundred-and-ten bucks and a bunch of change
And a wife beater with a mustard stain
I'll crush your brain like I'm crushin pills, what the fuck's the motherfuckin deal?
This shit's makin me feel like I'm tryin to do a motherfuckin cartwheel up a hill

[Royce Da 5'9"] + (Eminem)
How many bars? How many tabs of A-C-I-D, Y-E-S
Cause I'm sniffin M-Y E-X (F-U-C-K'd up and it's obvious)
Smoke and Henny in my chest (I'm B-A-N-A-N-A-S)
I'm a C-O-C-O-N-U-T (put this CD in then you'll see)
(The sequel to "Scary Movie", Bad is to Evil, a roofie to Roethlisberger)
You don't gonna wind up six feet deep under that shit's creek 
so I hope that you bought preservers

[Eminem]
You can put a turd on a plate
Silverware and a tablecloth to serve us
You don't bring shit to the table
I'm in your grill like a Seville when a moth gets murdered
You're pushin the envelope 
when I'm shovin that whole post office further
right off the surface of this earth 
into the darkest and the farthest corners

[Royce Da 5'9"]
How many bars? How many bars? Maui Wowie, Sour Diesel, how many jars?
To all my people I'll be to Mars, mami c'mon
She can actually wrap my nutsack around the back of her neck in the bathroom stall
Or she could just puke from sippin this piss from my 24-inch catheter cord

[Eminem]
I'm the type that'll take a bath with a whore
Drown her, bang her head on the passenger door
while I'm stashin her in the back, smackin her forehead 
on the dash 'til it's accidentally blowin the Benz jeep horn

[Royce Da 5'9"]
My friends be knowin that when I'm on a binge I'm stingy
Even when I'm ten deep in the room in the MGM with Lindsay Lohan and she on

[Outro: Mike Epps sample]
Syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka, huh-huh-huh... {*slows to a stop*}</pre>
