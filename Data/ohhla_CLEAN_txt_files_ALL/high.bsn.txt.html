[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant
I'm so high I won't, remember it
And I wish that this could last forever
But maybe one night is even better
Real nigga Mayne
All the people plotted with
Is the same ones I'm dividin' the profits with
Now I'm in the building like two planes bitch
Kickin' it with my shirt off, on some Liu Kang shit
Sleep with the sun up like I grew fangs bitch
I come alive in the night, on some Bruce Wayne shit
Livin' my life, gettin' high payments
Fuckin' with some new broads and they high maintenance
And they wearin' high heels, trip so we're high heels
Tipsy and high, rollin' zips, gettin' high man errthang' high

High, high, high, high, high, high
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high
It's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go
It's time to go, go

[Verse 2]
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant
I'm so high I won't, remember it
Cause' the penthouse 90 floors up
Make love and then join the mile high club
Yeah I'm on camera, fresh out of a sex scene
I just turn all my nightmares into wet dreams
I'm in a new crib, so big, I'm talkin' town size
Sippin' somethin' cold, smokin' weed by the pound size
Yeah I gotta big head ho, I think it's crown size
Bitch I do it big, and I never plan to down size
People who talk shit, is feelin' like dickheads
Saw me on the web like I had an extra six legs
Lookin' at my highlights
With a bitch with highlights
Crowd wavin' at me, all tryna' say hi right
Everything high

High, high, high, high, high, high
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high
It's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go
It's time to go, go

[Wiz Khalifa]
If you roll one up, I'm a roll one too
Oh you sayin' you don't smoke
Well that's all that we do
You be up in the club
I be up in the clouds
Ohhh, don't gotta ask me if I brought enough cause' we don't run out
Blow it by the o, even my fans smoke it
Cause' they throw it at my shows
Hidin' it when I travel in case the police gotta know
Rollin' it up in traffic
Make you smoke out of a bong, put you on different hashes
My chick is the baddest, my spliff is the fattest
I'm livin' so lavish
Gotta patch a lil kid tryna' get at this cabbage
My pinky ring a v8, I filled it with carrots
I'm Popeye with spinach, till' the day I die I'm gettin' high

High, high, high, high, high, high
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high
It's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go
It's time to go, go

I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant
I'm so high, I'm got... forget it

[Chiddy Bang]
I'm fly, my swell on priceline
Truthfully I want this shit to last a lifetime
Simply amazing, we blazin' as we just right rhymes
Cold flow, ice time, breakin' down bright pines
Enough with all the beefin' I'm over it
Outta town kush, but they smokin' that local shit
I always knew that I would be the man
They ride the greyhound, but I'm more a Peter Pan, we the fam
Off the scale, yeah we about to break the richter quick
Loud years, worth a thousand words on some picture shit
When it come to smokin' we have a certificate
I know them haters is wishin' we fade to licorice
Fuck it we up, my nigga Sean gave me another L
I need a high class chick that I match up with well
She familiar with Fendi, comfortable in the Chanel
And you errthang' high when you livin' swell

High, high, high, high, high, high
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high
It's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go
It's time to go, go</pre>
