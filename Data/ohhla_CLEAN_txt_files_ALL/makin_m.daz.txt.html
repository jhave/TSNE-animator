(Verse 1)
(Daz Dillinger)
I grab a bottle of gin and take a swig of my drank
I got a half ounce of bomb so I light up the dank
Smokin, chokin, hopin that the day goes smooth
Ain't no tellin, cuz a nigga right here might lose
I choose to do it G like it's supposed to see
Funky fresh in the flesh it's the D-A-Z
Call my nigga on the phone tell him it's poppin again
I got a fifth of Henn now the story begin
It's been a long time comin
Runnin, gunnin ya niggaz back and forth
See I don't need no support
See I do it by my lonely, so fuck ya phonies 
All you niggaz and you bitches don't really know me
See I dump from the gate, huh, loaded with hate
Rob ya for ya cake, and be on my way
I'm so mafioso, out the fo' do', niggaz 'round here don't know, so

(Sean T)
Heavy in the game, unpredictable
Inner thought, heated is heavy
You can tell motha fuckaz turn pale
Ain't no love for you other niggaz up and pluggin niggaz
You ain't shit without your homboys y'all ain't pullin triggaz
Rock mail is irrelevant
I rise up and cause shit since an adolescent
I've been breakin laws takin jaws everyday ghetto life
Got me kinda Alamo
But still I got pulled like a trigga nigga way sicka 
You don't wanna see a whore anyway in fashion
I'm Sean T, and I stay lit off the gangsta passion
So picture me mobbin a SUV
When I'm duckin and dodgin steady robbin
Fuck the police I got you open like a split wound
Goin like you on shrooms
I'm shinin like a diamond, brighter than a full moon
Make room, hungry niggaz ride fa sho'
Avoidin detours, haters, and the sheisty 5-0

(Chorus X2-San Quinn)
I see a pile of gold I got my hands in it
Gotta eat so we think 'till we stand in it
Niggaz move smokin fast when they land in it
Cuz they runnin up them bitches and the lavish shit
Sounds of us can never have enough
If you comin with the bullshit then back it up
Sounds of us can never have enough
If you comin with the bullshit then back it up

(Verse 2)
(San Quinn)
We get it at a low price shit hit the streets
Now we all in the lime light shinin
Rhyme right, for my wrong niggaz after long figgaz
Gettin fake ballers never payin gold diggers
Roll wit us, we sucka free
Make ten mil at least 
Where young niggaz gotta keep a heat
JT makin moves with San Quinn at his side
Ready to ride, from East to Westside
Fillmoe to Long Beach out the crest side
KC to Detroit we got ties
Make the crowd rise when we drop a rhyme
We got to shine, makin moves after mine

(JT The Bigga Figga)  
Circulate, rotate we keep it crackin
Boss game, DPG, Get Low factors
You want action, hotel to motel where we all make mil
Bust sales it's so real
Live shit, work now and floss later
Countin the cakes you knucklin up with the haters
And the playaz, stuck in the lab it's been official
Ridin the tracks and we act to get a issue
It's official, comin to get you we makin moves we the dudes
Holdin them tools we got news for the crews
On the underground pushin them tapes
Keep the business over West you talkin shit in my face, bitch

(Millo)
The streets is watchin, like I'm watchin the streets
24 around the clock, I'm gettin my grease
My young souls, keepin it crackin
From the Bay to LA, tryin to stay lavish
Orientated, keep it in the family
Niggaz can't handle me, cuz I'm so savly 
Marinated, and leadin the team
Hooked up and got tucked with the GLP
Recognize game, when it's in your face
Hard hittaz, hustlaz, on a paper chase
We gettin laced, by the finest in the West
When we hit the front do' we demandin our respect

(Chorus X2-San Quinn)
I see a pile of gold I got my hands in it
Gotta eat so we think 'till we stand in it
Niggaz move smokin fast when they land in it
Cuz they runnin up them bitches and the lavish shit
Sounds of us can never have enough
If you comin with the bullshit then back it up
Sounds of us can never have enough
If you comin with the bullshit then back it up</pre>
