(Sen Dog)
Don't let nobody treat me like crap
I'm pullin heads off sharp and smack em off francs
The best in these days I smoke on these tracks
Gonna mash your plan for holdin me back
Jump up rush the office with the gat
Lettin the niggaz see where my mind is at
Hurry up to the walls see how I react
But I keep comin back and that's for a fact
I got the beef, but no road I got dropped
And take each day the bullshit don't stop
Got to act with the man cause I don't suck cock
No matter how bad I wanna get to the top
The music go out like a fuckin lot
With the key and the dat I rap and just stop
Come and see me on a Soul Assas trip
Hittin stage, generate, pumpin all that lip

(Chorus)
YOU CAN'T FUCK WITH ME
I AM EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANT TO BE
A FUCKIN MAN!
YOU CAN'T FUCK WITH ME
I AM EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANT TO BE
A FUCKIN MAN!

(Sen Dog)
If y'all ever need help I don't wait
And I come from some shit that's put away
I hit these suckers that think they so great
Still a nigga die, so they can update
No matter how you try you'll always be fate
Breakin off chunks off of what I create
I see that liquorice all over your face
Back-stab a nigga in the mist of the chase
Fuck the bullshit let's get to the bottom
Stompin punk styles, agein rock got em
Only thing I don't wanna say when I drop em
Loadin my shells so don't try to hock em
Hittin the heat with the jig-ass beats
Bite my style, is the only way to compete
Smoke anybody if I ever lop heat
And anybody else that wanna fuck with me

(Chorus)
YOU CAN'T FUCK WITH ME
I AM EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANT TO BE
A FUCKIN MAN!
YOU CAN'T FUCK WITH ME
I AM EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANT TO BE
A FUCKIN MAN!

(Sen Dog)
I sing funky-ass shit that I bring
Fly likes a lot when I do my thing
Check it out y'all ain't no one nicer
Got it goin on with the mighty wanna cipher
Got a women crazy, when I beg
And hip-hop styles with the SX-10
Trust no one ain't nobody your friend
Cause this business hear all about to end
Don't mean comin back when they bust the raps
And all the little things of the nicer tracks
Hangin out in the uniform
Keep what I'm doin here all night long
Is to keep it goin, bring the thunder and pain
Ain't bitches same since I went insane
Fuckin with these bitches up in this game
To the depicts, drain on my FUCKIN TRAIN

(Chorus)
YOU CAN'T FUCK WITH ME
I AM EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANT TO BE
A FUCKIN MAN!
YOU CAN'T FUCK WITH ME
I AM EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANT TO BE
A FUCKIN MAN!</pre>
