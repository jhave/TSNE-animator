[Intro]
My love is eternal(music factory)
You can write that diary
Write it inna journal (a love will last forever)
Just gimme the chance my girl
No fight it
Yuh seen

[Verse 1]
I saw her in the park
Walking in the dark
But when mi step to har is like she neva waan fi talk
Mi ask her fi her name
She tell me fuck off
But mi neva vex with har
Mi jus buss a likkle laugh
Mi tell her seh mi like her
And mi want her to be mine
And if me get the chance
Me love her til the end of time
Me ask her fah her numba
But again this girl decline
But she change har mind
When me tell har this line

[Chorus]
I wanna love youuuuu
Like no other man will love you
I wanna hold youuuu
Like no other man will hold you
Now and forever
I wanna be your one and only girl
Now and forever (to di end of time)
My love, my love

[Verse 2]
My girl
Gimme the chance
And let me be your lover
Cause if you giv mi di chance
Me love you like there was no other
Cho
Me and you together
Wrap up in the sheet
During the time of stormy weather
True love is hard to find like a one cent
Dat means seh the love dat we could find could be God send
She say har man always busy
She say him always absent
Have the dollars but no have sense

[Chorus]
I wanna love youuuuu
Like no other man will love you
I wanna hold youuu
Like no other man will hold you
Now and forever
I wanna be your one and only girl
Now and forever (yeah yo yo yo yo)
My love my love

[Verse 3]
Baby girl
From now until di end of time
We should intertwine
Just give me a sign
I will make you happy to be mine
Just gimme the time

Dem seh mi full up of a rhyme

Not that I'm good with words
But I'm sincerely try fi tell her my mind
Baby girl your body so divine
Yuh man will lef you out ya by yourself mussi blind
Mi neva see dis yet you mussi one of kind
Your skin so fine
No back burn nothing

[Chorus]
I wanna love youuuuu
Like no other man will love you

Be close to me
And don't think I'm crazy
