Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
All day long, do it like Tony
Fuck her friend then I pass it to the big homie
Got a sign on my dick, bad bitches only
Got a sign on my dick, bad bitches only
Big bank roll, do it like Tony
Fuck her friend then I pass it to the big homie
Got a sign on my dick, bad bitches only
Got a sign on my dick, bad bitches only

[Tyga - Verse 1]
Well its that nigga that you call T-Raw
Runnin' that money like Madoff
Yea she gave that blow job then she get it laid off
I ain't got no time hoe, stop blowing up my cell phone
Sweatin' me like headbands, call that bitch Rondo
I'm fresher than the Prom hoe, teach ya we don't fly coach
Fuckin' but she act dumb, kick her out my condo
Real G's, Last King, Young Money ballin'
I give her a couple of shots and then she turn alcoholic
Metaphorically or Rhetoric
And I'm shittin' on your forehead
2 girls 1 cup...Yup
We did it again Last King YMCMB
I don't pay for bitches, bitches pay me

[Chorus]

[Gudda Gudda - Verse 2]
Uh, Knock knock, who the fuck is there?
A sign on my dick that say, "bad bitches come in here"
Make a freak whore, detour straight to my partna room and let him beat it like a keyboard
All I do is dick 'em I don't tip 'em like a stripper man
I got a ton of chicks under my belt like a zipper, yea
Walk up in the club, pick 'em out and then I pick 'em off
Pick 'em up and then knock em down and them I drop 'em off
I'ma dog keep your girl from round my type of shit or she'll be milk box material
And missing for the night man this shit is just that easy
When your pockets sittin' right
I turn my bed into a stage and let your girl rock on my mic

[Chorus]</pre>
