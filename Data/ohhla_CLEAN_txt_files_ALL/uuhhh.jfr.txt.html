(Uuhhh)
Can you feel it baby?
(Take me away)
Flow crazy
Make em' say
(Uuhhh)
Make It hot, uh
(Take me away)
Flow crazy
Make em' say
Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah)
Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah)

[Will Smith]
Been to the mountain top
Down to the valley
Philedelph to Cali
Y'all feel me like Harry felt Sally
Clothes exotic, flows erotic
No jewels that's for them fools who ain't got it
Rap to my own sitcom
Now I just sit calm
Watching y'all respond to my July 4th bomb (boom!)
Yeah I'm a nice kid
But here's some advice kid
Don't get me hyped
I'll set it off like my wife did
Playing down a path like Sajak
Wheel of a Fortune away
Price ain't right I don't play
Find yourself in Jeopardy
The first clue
What is Will Smith?
Hot to death not you
I'm like a Porsche, you a pinto
You like a tiny figurine, I'm monumental
You're like a small get together
On your neighbor's back porch
You know just a couple of y'all
I'm a million man march
Attack of the man in black
Like Jordan playing on a train
Yo my game on track
Mad ice for my wife
No care for what it costed
Had to ease up though
Her wrist got frost bit
My style, flava, delivery, my diction
Gettin' medieval like dude in Pulp Fiction
You want some bring it
Come one, come all, come in
Watch me take they heart away like Penny
I could take 12 rappers and put em' in line
Then 12 emcees that think they can rhyme
Then 12 more brothers that still ain't signed
Then don't do nothing just watch 'em decline
Gangsta hardcore, menace to society
Raps all the same
My pen spits variety
Eclecticism is a virtue
It may not be a word
But it's definitely a virtue
Rappers approaching me all across America
Believe me you don't wanna battle like Erykah
I was in the game before publishing was an issue
You're platinum now but next year I'm gonna miss you
Mad rappers like bad actors should have no parts
Wanna be mad check the charts any of them
Oh you don't see my name
You don't see my spot
Here's a hint
Look closer to the top

[Kel Spencer]
(Uuhhh)
Can you feel it baby?
(Take me away)
Flow crazy
Make em' say
(Uuhhh)
Make It hot, uh
(Take me away)
Flow crazy
Make em' say
Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah)
Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah)

[Kel Spencer]
Uh, love and loyalty yo
Yo the flow spray, Vito say
I'm tryin' to live
And if I catch you out of bounds
It's cheap shots to the ribs
Love and loyalty dawg
Do it how Pac and Big did it
It's the Wild Wild East
And me keepin' me jig with it
Play no games
Thirst to heat the rhyme
Motivation cause procrastination is the thief of time
Holding a torch
I was programmed to scorch
Can't run with the big dawgs?
Then stay on the porch
These cats is craftmatic
Hand on the steering wheel
Rocks from the road dodging oncoming traffic
Man-handle rappers, dismantle rappers
Y'all lukewarm slash sweet-scented candle rappers
Any team posing a threat we defeat those
The wealthy man is the man that knows how to keep dough
As long as y'all play foul I'mma keep hittin' free throws
Crush Spanish mamis calling me Kellito
Remember Lego blocks?
All about the paper now
I use writers block to build sky scraper style
Catch rappers using the same flows everyday cause they lame
True players gotta change their uniform after the game
Y'all seen the flow
Like y'all never seen before
Don't stop for the door
Why do you think green mean gold?
Baby learn life's lessons
Scratch regression
Kel Spence the truth, the answer to all questions
Come on (Uuhhh)

[Will Smith]
Damn Kel, you kind of good</pre>
