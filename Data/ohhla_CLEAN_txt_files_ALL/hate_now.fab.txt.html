[Fabolous]
Yeah
I'm a motherfuckin' ghetto superstar nigga
Got my nigga Paul Cain with me
Street dreams
I'm what street dreams are made of nigga
Hate me now
Do it now nigga
I'm burnin' like them blue flames nigga
They call me G-H-E-T-T-O-
Ghetto
Lets do this right nigga
What the fuck is up nigga?
These niggas can't even breathe now Cain

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
It won't stop 'till my account is in the billions
And I buy a home on the coast of Miami and the ammounts are in the millions
Fish tanks and flat screens mounted in the ceilings
Sippin' champagne I have trouble pronouncing while i'm chillin'
if I found out you was squealin'
You 'gon die even if Witness Protection put you in the mountains of New Zealand
Cause I hire bountys that be killin'
That play Hide-And-Go Seek and find you after countin' to a million
But a million records later
Theres still some speculators
Man these labels are giving the kid meals and checks like waiters
When I come through you never see my heels be decked in gators
And see Jordans that dropped when you was still a second grader
Spill the Tec on haters
I got a quick jab
But when I squeeze these slugs'll hit you a milla second later
I chill and check the waiter
Dudes play gangsta for a minute but run to the cops squealing seconds later
You still a Lexus trader
My credit so good I drive off in the SC and tell the dealer "Catch ya later"
All I need is one night I don't deal with second daters
Cause the white and gold stones on the grill and neck persuade her nigga

[Paul Cain]
Yeah
Yo Fab
We done pulled the Range out
The Benz out
The Caddy truck out
They ain't even see the 12-8 yet
These niggas still hatin'

[Verse 2: Paul Cain]
Ever since I got signed it seems like ya'll been hatin' on the god
We never held a conversation but you claimin' I'm a fraud
Started bringin' weight up while I starve
Gained some cash and the ego now ya perpetrating like ya hard
If you thinkin' you Pac i'm a wait in front of Quad
Have my Kingston bullets through ya face like I'm Bernard
Ya like beef but hate when i'm involved
Cause I don't give ya a chance ta dodge bullets from the 8 when it revolve
Niggas love when you broke but they hate when you get large
Wait for you to slip and try to find a way to get you robbed
Run in ya crib and duck tape you and ya broad
And don't leave prints so jakes never get the case resolved
So I play against the odds
When its all set two niggas with two 40s a peice retaliatin' on ya squad
If you get locked my Haitian'll leave you scarred
Rape you in the yard
With Gem Star blades cut ya face like a collage
While I sip champagne in the Vegas lamatage'
In the suite with two freaks videotapin' a manage'
Ice in the chain a face in the shepard'
Million dollar crib with a cranberry quarter and a 8 in the garage nigga

[Paul Cain]
Ya'll niggas
Ya'll niggas only seen half
This is just the begining man
See ya'll niggas was hatin' now man
Ya'll niggas gonna be sick to your stomach bending over throwin' up
When ya'll see the shit we got comin'
My album ain't even drop yet man
And ya'll niggas talkin' crazy
Man Paul Cain nigga
The album comin' fourth quarter
Ya'll motherfuckers is under pressure nigga
Desert Storm, SLK we killin' everything movin' nigga
Yeah</pre>
