[Intro]
"Ready...set...and begin"
Premo beats on the machine doggy, yeah
"Ready...set...and begin"
King side ta yu

[Verse 1: Craig G]
Ready, set, begin I highly recommend
When you hear this real hip hop you call up a friend
And let 'em know it ain't your average payover assistant
Bullshit on the air that's leavin the game twisted
Havin niggaz and bitches, chasin riches
Thinkin that can make 'em happy that thought is quite ridiculous
And the shit I'm bout to say, might get me black listed
But I don't give a fuck I gave my life to this shit, kid
And with that said, lets begin with these A &amp; R's
That only sign them clicks that obtain the sports cars
And I probably be your author cause I alwasy fought hard
For what I believe in, despite what you thought pah
Strap a bomb to my chest run in the courtyard
Of you favorite record label and send them to god
But you already been punished that's why your sales like that
You know that saying; that what you put out always come back
Handle yours people

[DJ Premier cuts and scratches]
"Ready...set..and begin"

[Verse 2: Craig G]
Okay, ready, set, begin I highly recommend
You niggaz runnin the game like some of us sin
Cause if not we gonna kick the fucking door of the hinge
Grab the VP by the post office assistant with tints
Hit ya head of promotion with a fist of the chins
There's a crew of hungry niggaz sellin clips to the prints
So keep frontin, signin all them fake diamond gyms
That with they gyms, video just sink in ya swim
And you highly mistakin if you think you could win
These words work from my foe, to the ink of my pen
They say I'm meek should inherit the earth
Plus the heavens, all ya money couldn't save you on Septembre 11th
Oh! Something to pay for, next time you take a drag
Of the dutch this city is crushed because boom rips a fag
And the economy is all it down ?with spottle?
If you're sick of bein lied to, here's some hiphop to guide you
You handle yours people

"Ready...set..and begin"

[Verse 3: Craig G]
Okay, ready, set, begin I highly recommend
You get someone to pray for you this game is a sin
There's a lot of phony people lackin change with the win
Make the wrong moves your brain should be stained in ya Benz
Some killers who run upon you ask for change of a ten
Some will bitch and focus, they got the aim for your Benz
When God calls believe he ain't reachin your voice tail
You talked the way in heaven with platinum tints
Platinum sales believe it's all man-made shit
You know the stuff they whine 'bout when they work with them click
And Big said it the best; Mo' Money Mo' Problems
But no money at all will have your .38 revolvin
Court cases pendin, stomach bendin from charcoal
Almost was my life changed and after I fought gold
And the whole point of these words, they came from a vet!
It's Hip-Hop I still love you, I ain't done with you yet!
We gotta save you!
