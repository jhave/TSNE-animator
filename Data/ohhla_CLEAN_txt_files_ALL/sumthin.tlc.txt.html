[Dre]
Remember back in the time
When the only sign we had was pickets?
But now in '94, it be this way, somethin' come wicked
Gangs killin' others fo' colors
Thangs that we wear fo' fashion
Other brothers take it fo' what reason? To be blastin' 
What da kcuf is goin' on?
Not soft like buttercups but
Had enough of singin' that same song
See, I stayed across the street from the projects
Took out yo' momma trash and groceries to her trunk 
To keep my pockets fat, like cellulite 
Only been to jail one week fo' some shull-bit 
And I pray to God I won't repeat
I shoulda pulled it when I had the chance to
No, I shouldn't a did that, cuz if I did that?
Y'all would not hear that phat shit 
That keeps you on yo' tippy-toes
Like that fella, not callin' no names
But really, "who's bad?"
I go through obstacles like a whole box of condoms 
You can't forget what you come from

[T-Boz]
Take a good look in the mirror 
And tell me, do you like what you see
Masters of deception, corruption and evil
But you're always quick to point the finger at me
Won't somebody tell me

1 - 	I just don't understand
	The ways of the world today
	Sometimes I feel 
	Like there's nothing to live for
	So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

[T-Boz]
What gave you the right to misjudge me
And write me off on the wall
Acting as if you understand me
In reality, you just don't know me at all

[Chilli]
Sometimes I can't help but wonder
If this was how it's meant to be
But if you search deep enough in your soul
You'll always find a slight reminder of me
Won't somebody tell me

Repeat 1

[Left Eye]
A-yo, if we could all agree 
To lettin' our souls become free 
Of that sweet bitterness 
Then who's chest would have the most seeds?
I keep misfocusin' my needs
And distress on my back with them cats 
They be blastin' into my knapsack
Ain't no accidental deathtraps
My mishap is the fact that I'm destined to snap
It's when I feel as though my body's able to go 
My mind is ready to flow, didn't you know?
First you catch and then I throw
It's my own sense of time
If I'm late, it's 'cuz I'm endin' my day
Just when the sun shines
And still gently advising the arisin' of the moon 
As it rolls around into my soundproof dimension

Repeat 1</pre>
