[Verse 1: Ms Krazie]
You said you loved me, once a mothafucking time
And now every time I look down deep into your eyes
I don't see nada. No love, no shame, what's your name again
Me enfadas, cansada de estas babosadas
Feel like walking, the hell out the door bags aren't necessary
It's scary but babe you got to understand
I mean when been hella trying
Both you and I against the world remember
Yet I'm trying not to hinder
Whatever is left, we'll hold on for another month
Until the night your coming home from fucking other cunts
And I'm a take that shit like it ain't nothing
Wouldn't that be perfect wouldn't it be something
If I cried every night til the day you took my breath away
Literally took it, then quickly asked for me to stay
You tell me baby, I'm sorry things are gunna change
And I'm just so damn stupid that I'll try again

[Chorus: Ms Krazie &amp; Duende]
I don't want this anymore
I'm tired baby, I'm tired of your shit
I'm tired of your shit too
We'll make it work if only for another day
Fuck another day girl today
What if I wanna stay
I don't want this anymore
I'm tired baby I'm tired of your shit
Yea this shit is getting old right
We'll make it? work if only for another day
I doubt you, I don't give a fuck about you

[Verse 2:]
[Duende:]
I tried to tell you, believe me girl I feel you
Cause you non stop talking your shit I been thru hell too
I put alot in this relationship but fuck that
I tried to change for you
But baby you don't want that
And try to act like I'm the asshole I'm use to it
Females, they don't make em like they use to
And if you say that you don't need me
Believe me it's? easy to get all of your shit
And just leave me
[Ms Krazie:]
We been together for how many years now?
We say we're trying in reality we kill time
Cause I can see it you no longer want to stay
And to get you to fuck, no pues chingasos I have to pay
This shit ain't working, I love you and I hate you
I'm tryna say what I have it just ain't working
A sick kinda love is what they say we have
We might be sick in the head cause a love we never had

[Chorus: Ms Krazie &amp; Duende]
I don't want this anymore
I'm tired baby, I'm tired of your shit
I'm tired of your shit too
We'll make it work if only for another day
Fuck another day girl today
What if I wanna stay
I don't want this anymore
I'm tired baby I'm tired of your shit
Yea this shit is getting old right
We'll make it? work if only for another day
I doubt you, I don't give a fuck about you

[Verse 3: Duende]
You say I'm sick in the head, I think you're sick too
Cause when I hate you I love you but I don't get you
Sometimes I'm glad your gone, sometimes I miss you
You say you're tired? I'm tired of this shit too
It's like reality check it hasn't hit you
I fucking love you but I don't want to be with you
But at the end of the day, we're still together
And I feel like if we ended today it's only better
But at the same time I feel like I could never leave you
[?]
This is a sick kinda love I know
Cause even though we hurt each other
Girl we can't get let go
And the sick part about it is that
We're meant for one another to be together
Sometimes I hate her more then I love her
And that's what gets me
I didn't even see it like this
[?]

[Chorus: Ms Krazie &amp; Duende]
I don't want this anymore
I'm tired baby, I'm tired of your shit
I'm tired of your shit too
We'll make it work if only for another day
Fuck another day girl today
What if I wanna stay
I don't want this anymore
I'm tired baby I'm tired of your shit
Yea this shit is getting old right
We'll make it? work if only for another day
I doubt you, I don't give a fuck about you</pre>
