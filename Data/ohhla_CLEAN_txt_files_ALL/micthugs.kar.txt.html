INTRO [Kardinal Offishall]
Yeah
Turn my headphones up
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, feeling kind of sick though
Yeah, now I'mma kick this
Uh huh, uh huh uh huh
DJs, cut this back to back
Word, Circle
Silver House And the Girl, Figure IV
Head nod, yeah y'all know

[Kardinal Offishall]
Yo that kid nice
Where he from though?  T-dot (ohhh)
Where the ice at?  Oh I see underground emcee
Nah, but he nice though
He flip that shit twice though, he sounding like (who?)
Nah, it a must that he bust you (fo' real)
He be eating that mic though
Ever see the way he flows and tears down the show
(Fo' real), he clever
Never sever the Ever from fresh when he spits, everything's a hit
He got skills like Mad and the Superfriends
When he does a duo, it comes out like a crew track, he's so wicked
Cooler than Ice Cube, Mack more than 10 at one time
Like Choclair he's a Virgin to the wack rhyme
It's true (fo' real)
Got a Blueprint like Thrust, said he's notorious
And watch the hit bust all over the country (fo' real)
Even on BET, ask Tigga about them niggas with that Northern Touch beat they was playing
No playing, that nigga with the afro
That's right, tight and rocks crowds all night (word)
Style like no other tall brother on your FM dial
My nigga kip-ki-kip-ki-Kardinal
You know

CHORUS [little girl singing]
He once was a thug from around the way
He once was a thug from around the way
He once was a thug from around the way
He once was a thug from around the way

[Kardinal Offishall]
Check it
A dis ain't a dis if a dis has discrepancies
I dismiss your dissidences and doubt your intelligence
And discuss how disjoint your disc
From the dispatch, a distance throw all y'all from shit that's wack
Steady disguising your disfavour, disliking my steelo
Dis ain't kindergarten, you don't have to go where we go
Discipline yourself before your ego disappears
While I discretely disassemble you from your career
Stupid!  Dis is not your ordinary rapper dis
Dis so all you niggas discover just who the dapper is
Causing discomfort, disallowing your dis-jock to rock
Any record 'cause your whole sound's flop, yo
Dis is going out to niggas who dis without
Thinking about what the hell they doing, yo your shit we're booing
Oh... while I discombobulate you
This is going out to any nigga opposing my crew
Like that
Yo, Silver House And the Girl 2000
Kardinal Offishall, in your ear side, nawmean
