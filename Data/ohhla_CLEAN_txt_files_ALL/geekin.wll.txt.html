[Chorus]
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek

Here we go, here we, here we go
Here we go, here we, here we go
Here we go, here we, here we go
Here we go, here we, here we go

[Verse 1]
Hey, I'm on that geek, geek
Freaking technology technique
Yeah, I flow tight, never leak
I'm the future with a bunch of antique
I make Google money, that's a lot of clicks
So tell me who the dummy and who the genie is?
Yeah, that's why you buy it, use it, use it at it
I thought it up and you bought it
I bought cause I'm technologic
Oh, yep, I might it have called
He wasn't one but he wasn't old
Oze, triple ones, he was an oz
Oz, yo, I'm ice cold
I am too cool, I am new school
I am plus pic, let me take a flick booth
Hey y'all, I'm the fucking nerd
I'm about to ball real big, Mark Zuckerberg
You know the nerd is a perp, what you heard?
Ain't need to follow, but lead up, tweety bird

[Chorus]
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek

Here we go, here we, here we go
Here we go, here we, here we go
Here we go, here we, here we go
Here we go, here we, here we go

[Verse 2]
Hey, I roll with gangsta geeks
We're white cold like Dr Dre been making Beats
He made it out that got billion uses in a week
We bought a boat, four hundred eighty feet
I'm so dope, baby, I'm a shit geek
But ladies know, that's why they send me tweet tweets
I let them know that I be on my B.I.Z.'
Pimping technology, that's what I be
Floften, willy on the cover of Fortune
Fived up below, sending flows to martians
Gold digger pros got me taking precaution
Cause they just want my dope #extortion
But I don't go for that, y'all know my style
I rode it out for that, call tricky out
I'm so pay, my friends call me pay pal
I make a lot of chips, now they call me Intel

[Chorus]
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek on
Get my geek on, get my, get my geek

Here we go, here we, here we go
Here we go, here we, here we go
Here we go, here we, here we go
Here we go, here we, here we go

[Verse 3]
I had a dream and then the dream came true
I bought a boat and I bought a private plane too
I bought a space ship to go to outer space too
And all I had to do is get the ace in the stool
Check me out, I'm a, I'm an engineer
A mathematician, technician and a visioneer
A scientist, the motherfucking nerd
The rebirth, the clue, fuck what you heard</pre>
