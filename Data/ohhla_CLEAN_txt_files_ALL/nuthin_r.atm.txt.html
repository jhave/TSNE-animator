[Windnbreeze solo]

[Intro]
Windnbreeze, the god of bliss

[Chorus]
Nothing really happens when you hold on to the wind
Standing by the clock, grooming time, picking ticks
My phenotype type is no longer bioluminous
And I must buy luminous
Objective to soak myself and objects into fluids
If nothing really happens, it was something I was trapped in
Nothing really happens when you hold onto the wind
Standing by the clock, grooming time, picking ticks
My phenotype type is no longer bioluminous
And I must buy luminous
Objective to soak myself and objects into fluids
If nothing really happens, it was something I was trapped in...

[Verse 1]
I browse at palms before palms cover eyebrows
And get in tune with the echo-like high sounds created by my forearms
Yo, I've got four arms, and a boat attaches to stomach
And I plummet into tumultuous dizziness, soon to be dysrhythmia
Falling into a quick nostalgia, water bowelers from a shallow murmur
Bo, wind-up figurine, big trollers and Victorian addicts
I never settle for sleep, I just vindicate kettles for tea
Some of em like Carmen and cinnamon
But are like sipping the sediments and residue
After taking apart synonyms
In the dark is where you're living in
And it starts with the listener, the message is that the [logs] be delivered on a whim
Eyes fixed, I watched you hollow him and follow him
And the Mignonette Circles through atmospheric friction [trebling]
You're obligated to take this oblique twist to test if you're smart enough for oblivion
Considering lost to a wander man
Like a sedentary nomad found, heliotrope in hand
Trying to escape the shadows of a really dark and placid labyrinth
You sang silly sarcastic banter links
It's a mystery to he, sorta like the way the Pink Panther thinks
In an open-shut episode with an extra globe, bleary gaze gives glance to wink
Even the involuntary twitch was laborious
But your brain isn't robust

There's more grass isle
Like a grasshopper hopping over blades of grass
While I cut blades of grass with two cut blades of glass
Attach to the end, to make a blade-of-glass scissor
Yo, did you hear anything about a grade, mister?
Did you want me to kick your ass and dilute your linear mass until you turn into a blister?
I'll give you a B minus or a B plus
Any other insect in the kingdom of insectivores
When I reflect on cloths
Disinfectivores
Do a diagnostic test on spores
And a visual check on boards

Yo, for checkmate, anticipate n tissues for tears
Absorbed by glorious, cloths
Composed of distorted, morbid wings of moths
When inventories unmentionable [nine years, nine years]
And even my peers find it nonsensical
The way I tantalize with tentacles
And send ten million sickle-cell anemia amoebas to fight lymphatic systems
Understood anguish, under the woods in the forest
I'm not a fan, and you're not famous
Then, if marriage dissed 'em, thus we can't elope
And if we can't elope
We eat cantaloupe
Running with antelope
Like ants in a moat
Chanting with ghosts who wear the fanciest cloths so crimson
Hey, and if I'm panting the most
At least I can float through spirit to dimensions
Without confusion, cause I'm here for maintenance
I may incense scents?
By my primate walks bipedal like a primate
We walk « by petals, by petals » is what we say
After we leave the garden, with flowers in bloom
Pollinating recessive mutations
On plants on planets in the ethereal
Do you drink serums for delirium?
Diluted dialect firds (?), thus disillusional
You're lacking innocence, unlike the Little Prince
You'll ask, « What's ephemeral ? »
Like the presence of gorgons on perches
Next to Mormon churches
And Mormon merkants keep reading from the gargoyle
Takes precedence over the precipice
With the precise recipe that is saliva
From the snargoyles, into a cup of puss
Sipping slow I doeth my body wrapped around the quintessence of dust
Like Hamlet
I can't handle it
My phenotype is, it be no longer biolumionous
My paws lack candlewick
I need a brand-new opposed to amputate and Vulcan grip
To grasp my many perplexed poses of focus
Foretold to the equivalent factor of broken bliss
But don't be mistaken
Windnbreeze is still a god of it, god of it, god of it

[Chorus]
Nothing really happens when you hold on to the wind
Standing by the clock, grooming time, picking ticks
My phenotype type is no longer bioluminous
And I must buy luminous
Objective to soak myself and objects into fluids
If nothing really happens, it was something I was trapped in
Nothing really happens when you hold onto the wind
Standing by the clock, grooming time, picking ticks
My phenotype type is no longer bioluminous
And I must buy luminous
Objective to soak myself and objects into fluids
If nothing really happens, it was something I was trapped in...</pre>
