Typed by: AZ Lyrics

They say the smartest thing you can do is sign yourself... So I did it.
And that might of been the best thing I ever did

[Chorus]
I got a bank like an investor, I'm a CEO the game
And they hate cuz I'm successful for myself I made a name
Niggas said that they would help you but they really all the same
And I finally realized that
These Niggas just want to see me down
Want to see me fall
Want to see me down and fucked up
Hope to god I'm dead and locked up
Niggas just want to see me down
Want to see me fall
Want to see me down and fucked up
Prayin' to god I'm dead and locked up

[Verse 1]
Hate cuz I'm successful, pray bcuz I'm that nigga
These bitches tryna cherish they moments so they taking pictures
Had to get a young fuck nigga straight but I can't say the issue
I'm so hungry for a plate that I ate the grissel
I earned my black shirt and white stripes to make it official
And I made yo ass famous I hate that I dissed you
Don't play with that pistol if you ain't gon' use it ho
And I signed myself pound sign music flow

[Chorus]
I got a bank like an investor, I'm a CEO the game
And they hate cuz I'm successful for myself I made a name
These niggas said that they would help you but they really all the same
And I finally realized that
Niggas just want to see me down,
Want to see me fall
Want to see me down and fucked up
Hope to god I'm dead and locked up
Niggas just want to see me down,
Want to see me fall
Want to see me down and fucked up
Prayin' to god I'm dead and locked up

[Verse 2]
I just spent 10 months off in Dekalb and I ain't never goin' back
I swear yall don't the half about me
I kiss my mama and hug my dad
And say my prayers and tuck my gat
I swear yall don't know the half about me-e
I got blessed bcuz I never had shit
And got wrecked from staying out of Second
I got head from a bitch named Sandy
And forgot everything shoutout to the Xanex
These niggas pure pussy, I see it in they faces
Buckin' on these niggas like I'm smoking weed on probation
Don't ask me if I'm with them, I be with them Haitians
And I'm fresh as hell number 3 in the nation
Everybody got the beat oh my god he crazy
I'm still goin' crazy
That's just bad business
Need I past tense it
I already did it
Make my young niggas take that, like I fuck with Diddy
You rather fuck ugly hoes for a pretty penny
Meanwhile I'm still goin' in on these bitch niggas

[Chorus]
I got a bank like an investor, I'm a CEO the game
And they hate cuz I'm successful for myself I made a name
Niggas said that they would help you but they really all the same
And I finally realized that
These niggas just want to see me down,
Want to see me fall
Want to see me down and fucked up
Hope to god I'm dead and locked up
Niggas just want to see me down,
Want to see me fall
Want to see me down and fucked up
Prayin' to god I'm dead and locked up</pre>
