Goes around
What comes around goes around

Sittin here reminiscin back to high school
When everytime I see you, girl, you know that I drool
Day-dreamin in class thinkin what would I say
When I saw you, but you never looked my way
It started freshman year and lasted straight to the 12th grade
I have to give it to you, though, you was top-shelf, babe
I asked myself time and time again: what was it
About me that made me treat me like a buzzard
I speak to you in the hall and you ignore me
You keep walkin and talkin like you never saw me 
You didn't have to conversate with me, I can say that
It woulda made my day if you just had waved back
I used to buy you candy, lollypops and gum drops
I even pack a extra-sandwich in my lunch box
You're treatin me like dirt and everyone in the school knows
You call me out my name and crack jokes on my school clothes
If anyone could make you feel good, girl, I could
But you give me that look like you don't wanna be bothered
But that's okay, just keep on frontin, see
Cause one day I'ma make it, and you'll be wantin me
Been tryin hard ever since I graduated 
To make it big, and yes, I finally made it
Been doin shows, videos and tv
Now everywhere you go everybody knows me
Now the tables have turned and now it's me you're hawkin
Now I turn up my nose, and keep on walkin
You see, ladies marvel me in clubs frequently
And you make it your duty to come and speak to me
Rememberin how she played me in the past
Yeah, we can talk, I'm in a rush, please make it fast
And we can start off with all the men you been with
And don't come poppin that just-a-friend bit
Remember how you used to diss me and play me out, how
Come you got so much stuff to talk about now?
The word's around town that you're on the money tip
But sorry, I can't do nothin for ya, honey dip
So pardon me as I make my way to the dancefloor
And over to the bar because that's what I came for
Cuties pamperin me with champagne and roses
As I think to myself: thank God for showbiz!
Everywhere I turn girlies throwin me rhythm
Drinkin and thinkin who will be my victim
Here comes that girl that used to diss me
She whispers in my ear could she come home with me
Yup, get your coat and we could shoot north
Took her to the crib, and cold knocked her boots off
After i got it, yo, I never did call back
Thinkin how she used to front like she was all that
It's a new game, and the odds are in my favor
She caught the vapors and nothin could save her

What comes around goes around
You know what I'm talkin about
What comes around goes around
What comes around goes around
What comes around goes around</pre>
