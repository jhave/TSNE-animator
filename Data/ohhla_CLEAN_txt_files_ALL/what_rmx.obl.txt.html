[One Be Lo]
You say you keepin' it real, it sound more like you glamorised
But what I do with mics, you can only fantasize
OneManArmy swing it like samurais
See for yourself and tell me what you analyse
Search and you'll find, these lyrics I design
Be the greatest thing to happen to a button that rewinds
My style's plenty
Me without mics is like Luke without Force without MD's without 20/20
Vision, I see through your competition
You might be fly, but I'm a hawk, you'se a pigeon
My lyrical equipment like the stuff NASA got
You should-a would-a could-a, like them seven astronauts
You know you can't rock it, what you grabbin' for?
Keep comin' at me with that bull, I ain't a matador
I'm just a microphone metaphor specialiser
I blow your mind like a drunk driver with a breathalyser
I recognise the fact that I'm so phat
So when it comes to speech I'm an exerciser
You in a wack crew and this is what you call terror
You carry dead weight, you should've been a pallbearer

[Decompoze]
You disintegrate with time, you can't innovate a rhyme
Wanna impress me son, imitate a mime
I demonstrate the line that'll penetrate your mind
Let me emirate how I'm gonna generate the shine
That keeps you squinting twice, I'm fly like Vincent Price
Disperse one first, your thirst like Quentin Ice
With the, flow freakin', flip sines like cosecant
My show's your rose beacon, when you know 'Compoze speakin'
Step to me, I'm refereein' like it's "foul two"
But I'll do a style you can't bear like Kyle Yoo
Now you, is who I'm against, with the constant
Comments, the content of my consonance
The consequence will be the first down like ten yards
That's where I send hordes, emcees I've been scored
With my metallic D, I want my space in the galaxy
So just remain calm like Mallaby

[One Be Lo + Decompoze]
If you'se a hip-hop fan, put your hands in the sky
'Cause as long as we around, hip-hop will never die
It don't take a G.E.D. to figure out
That the S.U.B. is what it's all about
No doubt, this is what it's all about
No doubt, this is what it's all about
No doubt, this is what it's all about
No doubt, this is what it's all about

[One Be Lo]
If you'se a hip-hop fan, put your hands in the sky

[Decompoze]
Cause as long as we around, hip-hop will never die

[One Be Lo]
It don't take a G.E.D. to figure out

[One Be Lo + Decompoze]
That the S.U.B. is what it's all about

[Decompoze]
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt

[One Be Lo]
This is what it's all about
