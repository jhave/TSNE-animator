Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Look at you!
Look at, look at you!
Look at, look at you!
Look at, look at you!
Free styling!
Look at, look at you!
Look at, look at you!
Look at, look at you!
All behind my back

[Chorus]
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
Say what you want!
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
Say what you want!

Yo, my flow is so criminal
I'm busting it out, can you hear me now?
I'm up in the party, I'm freaking out
It's three in the morning on cloud nine, see me rocking now out of the
The lights is on, turn 'em all
Yeah, I'm a monster, you ain't scared of nothing
I'm backing it up while you're busy fronting
When the talk goes sick we'll be talking

[Chorus]
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
Say what you want!
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
Say what you want!

Look at you down so minimal
You wanna be fly but you're living low
I'm the b-b-b-boss cause I said so
I'll be rapping the game up in the chokehold
You keep talking ease, but I'm steady getting paper
I got pounds of the money, pounds, pounds of my money bag!...
Be gone - to all my haters!

[Chorus]
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
Say what you want!
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
Say what you want!

You can talk the all blue sky
You can see success right through my eyes
Hater, hater
Haters, haters, haters, haters, hater
Going down, down, down [repeats echo]

Look at you!
Look at, look at you!
Look at, look at you!
Free styling!
Look at, look at you
Look at, look at you
Look at, look at you
All behind my back

[Chorus]
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
Say what you want!
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
All day talking that, talking that mess
Say what you want!</pre>
