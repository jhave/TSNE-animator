"Yo Grouch, what's up? It's Ab
 Uh, I'm out here man, hit me up, hit me up at the office
 I got this idea for this song I want to do with you
 Um, hopefully we can do that shit
 Um, I don't know what I'ma call it
 But the hook is like
 'Blood's thicker than water, but dicks are no stronger than pussies
  Friends should last longer but it gets ugly
  Push me to the point of no return
  Fools they waste sperm and cool bridges they burn
  Blood's thicker than water...'
 I can hear me and you fucking up some shit on that
 Anyway..."

[Aceyalone]
Does a woman make a man feel like a man
because she's giving him the pussy hole?
Does a man make a woman feel like a woman
cause he said she was sweeter than a Tootsie Roll?
Yeah, with self-control she'll be first on the scroll
but it's all about the scrotum and the pole
And that feeling that just takes a hold of most people
The pussy and the dick are equal, both deceitful
Some niggas ain't got control of they ding-a-ling
Forget about everything when they start tingling
And some gals can't stop mingling
Need someone to scratch the itch, bitch keep jingling
But mother nature's more powerful than you think
After a couple drinks, you'll hit it if it stinks
Cause ain't nobody perfect and plus
babies have to be born and nuts have to be bust
Adjust, don't fuck over somebody you trust
Going head over heels over lust, but life is real

[Chorus: Abstract Rude]
Blood's thicker than water, but dicks are no stronger than pussies
Friends should last longer, but it gets ugly
Push me like a button, nothing earned
Fools, they waste sperm and cool bridges they burn
Blood's thicker than water, but dicks are no stronger than pussies
Friends should have honor, but it gets ugly
Push me like a button, nothing earned
Fools, they waste sperm and cool bridges they burn

[The Grouch]
Now if you had the opportunity to fuck off things with you and me
over a breezy, then you probably would
Hopefully I wouldn't trip, but naturally I should
and actually if we were close, it would be to the good
Cause if you was using judgement and wasn't on no love shit
An example of how blood's thick is me being cool
Rule of thumbs, you've heard them like M.O.B. and friends too
I've got too much game and business to attend to to cry
And though I'd be the first to ask you why
And I'd definitely be upset to catch you in a lie
Wouldn't be the first time that sharing was caring
Ask Eligh how it goes down, tempers aren't always flaring
Staring at the situation open-minded
The only way to go cause time can't be rewinded
Find it in your interest not to fool with my wife though
cause what would happen then is something that you wouldn't like to know

[Chorus: Aceyalone]

[Abstract Rude]
What's up baby? I see you making moves
You've got a point to prove, and issues with Rude
I showed you love, fed you food, hooked you up with my troops
Around you place sipping blues, didn't even make you pay dues
Even when I had pick and choose for you, I was in the mood
And see I, I'm a hardcore stuck in the war
Can't take many more first night scores out on tour
The pure thought whispers settle down, don't mess around
The young mind, yeah wants to find what's new in town
But I can't blame ya, call you out then name ya (biatch!)
Hell I'm an entertainer, L.A. underground rap star
who ain't got that far, it'll be our little secret
For sure something you'll regret and sleep with
I swallow pride, plus the envious and jealous love
Slow to anger, not a glutton, comes with high cost
of blood loss that's worse than having no water
And dick and pussy is weak, and that'll get you caught up
Look at you tryna run through my whole crew
You hitting speed bumps, it's a rocky road boo
It's a rocky road boo

[Chorus: The Grouch]</pre>
