[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
I want to apologize for makin you wait so long for the sequel
Wyclef, Mary J., this one called What About the Baby
You ever been like

[Verse One: Wyclef]
Let me talk to my daughter
Daughter this is your poppa
I know it's been a while
We haven't talked

[Mary J. Blige]
But daddy you've been gone
And me and mom have been all alone
It's been a struggle and you weren't there for us
He say

[Wyclef Jean]
Okay, when I called you
She wouldn't put you on the phone
She call the police, restrainin order
50 feet, from my home
I tried, I ain't lyin
It's so sad that the heavens cryin, AYY~!
Once a boy and twice a man
I'm just tryin to do the best I can
Give me a chance girl

[Chorus: Wyclef]
A grown man ain't supposed to cry
So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice
Everything gon' be alright
Baby girl I'm by your side, dry your eyes

[Verse Two: Mary J. Blige]
Let's talk this over
Now see I heard everything that you told her
But it's gon' take more than words
for you to be a father, uh-huh
Responsibilities of a man
Like stayin faithful just for the fam'
What if she knew that you chose
another over her mother, aowwww!
So you called her
and I wouldn't put her on the phone
I called the police yes, restrainin order
50 feet, from my home
I tried, I ain't lyin
It's so sad that the heavens are cryin, yeahhh
Once a girl, twice of a man
And I'ma try to do the best I can
I can't give you a chance noooo

[Chorus: Blige]
A woman ain't supposed to cry
So why don't you just wipe your eyes, dry your eyes
You've learned a house is not a home
When you're living all alone, and you want back home

[Verse Three: Wyclef]
WAIT A MINUTE GIRL! You're my joy, happiness that you bring
Turn the fall back to spring girl, you're my bling
You a hip-hop song I heard for the first time time
Studied all the words to the rhyme
You're my life, without you there's no sun, there's no moon
There's no stars, shinin in the ni-iight

[Mary J. Blige]
But if I give you a chance, would you show me you care
Be a man, no matter what the circumstances
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHOW~!

[Chorus: Wyclef]
A grown man ain't supposed to cry
So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice

[Blige]
You've learned a house is not a home
When you're living all alone, and you want back home

[Chorus: Wyclef]
A grown man ain't supposed to cry
So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice
(What about the baby~! What about the baby~!)
Everything gon' be alright
Baby girl I'm by your side, I apologize!
I cry, and I cry, I cry
