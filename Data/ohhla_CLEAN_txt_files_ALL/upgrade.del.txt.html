So upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

Comin from the outer regions of the universe
Deltron Zero and Automator
Check it

Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

Hey time for you to upgrade, fuck save, time to load 
All my rhymes is sold
And find your own
Salivate over what I collaborate
with high tech wizardry 
and breathe new life into the industry
Save to the hard drive for the archives
Three thousand thirty with a global apartheid
Sensitivity ain't the energy
Brain chemically contorted
With the coordinates to your ordinance

Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

Yo, your recovery's slow
My dual input 
Plus my modem
The tools in foot
Long songs instrumental digital projector professor
I'll school you on the art and how it's texture mapped
Get your act together, my style is mega
Educate the heads of eight lonely beggars
Only shred of evidence is the virtual file
Stored within the cerebellum hit you Berkowitz style

Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

My defense capabilities with ape agilitiy
Take possibilities to the point of sense and shatter it
Commence the babbling I'm meditatin' on a homosapien
With no education I'm 3D acceleration
My programmin' language is the strangest
To come to grips with mechanized mischief
Kicks it off with circular projectiles X-Files 
Herald as the most important dwarf the corporates

Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

Hey, I reduce the game
When I boost my brain
What you used to sayin
I loosen the frame
With shock announcements
T-Minus and countin'
Effects control and bouncin'
Star studded and flooded like fountains
A new machine
Real artists are few between
You better lube your screen
My renders are splendor
Three sixty reflecting quickly
Increase your disk speed
So you can,

Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

My production model is the stuff to boggle minds
You got a logon time of exactly thirty-six nanoseconds
Ambidextrious with ambience
Watch the cannons twist while I lockout my hardware
Word warfare logistically locate and process
With psychotropics to optimize my profits
Envelop you with development kits that help me
To embellish the elements dynamic and too intelligent

Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

Lookie here, as soon as I release the chip
You cease the rips and not
Since you want to top this reach to it
Digital retouch, reconstruct a whole conglomerate 
With our armaments we use with tolerance
Such as a G-Bomb, cyborg with 3 arms
Translate the ancient language with a brain dish
Micro machines polystrene conducting electrons
Deltron strengthen with molecular bonds

Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Uuhaaaa...uh</pre>
