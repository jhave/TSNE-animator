[Akinyele]
Check it, check it, check it, check it
Say in the world (in the world)
Say in the whole round world (in the whole round world)
Say in the worrrrrrrrrrrrrllllllllllllllld, ha
(In the worrrrrrrrrrrrrllllllllllllllld) yes, yo, yo
In the worrrrrrrrrrrrrllllllllllllllld, yes
In the whole round world

[Verse One]
I take it day by day, strivin to live like the Romans
Instead of shoppin at Lomans I wanna roam the globe wearin robes
Fuck, designer clothes and them minor hoes
I got my beer{?} back up against the wall like vaginals
tryin to go straight, instead I go diagonal
Which path to go, which path to walk
When I was young I used to push my niggaz through the park
and past marked shoppin carts, lettin guns spark
Desert Eagles and I'm not talkin bout motherfuckin hearts
Makin money, gettin dough that was my style
I wanted to blow, like some juve, who didn't make it home from trial
Meanwhile I profile with two, guns that I'm holdin in
seperate hands, like I'm in the dancehall, bo-gglin
I know that's when I had visions of, livin in prison
No time to ask questions, no time to start quizzin
Talkin bout - IT'S HIM, IT'S HIM, IT'S HIM, IT'S HIM
I get on some Channel Live shit and start to +Spark Mad Ism+
I represent my life with a silver knife made of sterl{?}
Carvin my heart sharp to stay on point in this world

[Chorus: Akinyele]
Say in the world (in the world)
Say in the whole round world (in the whole round world)
Say in the worrrrrrrrrrrrrllllllllllllllld, yo
(In the worrrrrrrrrrrrrllllllllllllllld) yo, yo, yo
In the worrrrrrrrrrrrrllllllllllllllld, yes
In the whole round world

[Verse Two]
I done been throughout the land and man it all seem the same
Ak-nel done caught enough planes like trains
Lookin for home improvement, makin out of state movements
Gunnin and sunnin, niggaz like students
I realized the world was in my hand ever since
I rubbed my fingertips, on my jeans and got the blueprints
Now I'm changin my, government, name like Prince
Y'all can't see me, as if I was dressed in tints
Bein invincible, that's the Joe Clark principle
I'm livin proof like alcohol with Dr. {?}
Too sensible, what you expect when this un+Usual Suspect+
leave the mic crippled and bent, like Verbal Kint
I still represent niggaz like legal aid
Front on me you take a loss, all day, every day
Better yet, catch a couple of L's like Cool J
The Ak still rip, even if I don't do that
EH, EHHH, EHHH, EH-EHH type shit - see me no make no joke
This rap pro got this whole flow way under control like remotes
I represent my life with a silver knife made of sterl{?}
Carvin my heart sharp to stay on point in this world

[singers]
In the worrrrrrrrrrrrrllllllllllllllld
In the worrrrrrrrrrrrrllllllllllllllld
In the whole round world

[Ak] Yo, yo, yo

[Chorus] - 2X to fade

[Ak] Yes, in the whole round motherfuckin world!</pre>
