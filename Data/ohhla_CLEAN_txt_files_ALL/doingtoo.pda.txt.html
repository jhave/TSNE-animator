Chorus: Paula DeAnda
I'm leaving messages and voice mail
Telling you, "I miss you"
Baby, am I doing too much (Too much)
Why you tryin' to diss me, when I just wanna kiss you
Baby, am I doing too much
Tell me, what's the issue
Who I give these lips to
Baby, am I doing too much (Too much)
This is turnin' into
Something I ain't hip to
Baby, am I doing too much (Too much)

[Paula DeAnda]
(Verse 1)
See, you got me all alone
Waiting right here on the phone, for
You to call me, just to hear your voice tone
I keep on wonderin' if you was even feelin' me
I keep on wonderin' if this was even meant to be
Tell me, am I wasting time
Boy, you're showing me no signs
Is it cause you on your grind
Cause you always on my mind
I keep on wonderin' if everything you said was true
I keep on wonderin' if you were really comin' through

Hook 1: Paula DeAnda
Now here I go again, blowin' you up
And my girlfriend's keep telling me, I'm doin' too much
Now here I go again, blowin' you up
And my girlfriend's keep telling me, I'm doin' too much

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
I'm out, with my girls
Tryin' have a good time (Good time)
And you know I'm looking fly
Tryin' to meet some other guys
But it gets hard sometimes cause there ain't no one just like you (You)
I try my best, but I can't shake this feel you got me through
All I can picture is the color of your eyes (Color of your eyes)
And the way you make me smile
I ain't felt this in a while
But I came to a conclusion
That this is pure illusion
Chaos and confusion
But I'm not gon' let it ruin

Hook 2: Paula DeAnda
The way I feel about myself cause I got self-esteem (Esteem)
Sometimes I wonder if I'm just chasin' a fantasy
The way I feel about myself cause I got self-esteem (Esteem)
Sometimes I wonder if I'm just chasin' a fantasy

Repeat Chorus

Pre-Verse: Baby Bash
Just leave your name and number
And I'm a holla at ya
Just leave your name and number
And I'm a holla at ya

Repeat Pre-Verse

[Rap Verse: Baby Bash]
Ronnie Ray
All day
Women in the hallway
Everyday
Losin' track, of the people tryin' to call me
Don't take this, the wrong way
I been havin' long days
Doin' it, moving 'round the town
Wherever I'm gettin' my song played (Played)

Repeat Hook 1

Repeat Chorus

[Paula DeAnda]
Am I doing too much
