Typed by: HAWpdt@hotmail.com

[Intro-Rock (Starang Wondah)]
Here We Come, Here We Come
Here We Come, Here We Come
(Yeah! Starang Wondah in the building)
Here We Come, Here We Come
(Dru-Ha, you know you my favorite white boy, right? Duck Down!
Uh-huh, here we go, come on, y'all, bringin' forth Heltah Skeltah)

[Hook-Rock (Starang Wondah)]
Here We Come, Here We Come
If you a dedicated soldier, say "Here We Come", let's ride
(Here We Come, oh) Here we go
It's time, take what's ours, time to glow and shine (OK, Here We Come)
What's ours is ours and what's y'alls is ours
Brooklyn keep on takin' it, we shakin' all y'all cowards again
(Here We Come) Here we go, it's time, mound up, it's goin' down (Sean P!)

[Verse 1-Sean Price]
Hey yo, new shit, out of the blue, Freddy Adu kick
Black and blue shit, fuck it, just listen to the music
It's Sean, once again, back it's Da Incredible Rap Team
Slap steam out your fuckin' physical frame
Listen my nigga, Ruck is the name
A broke rapper ready to rob niggas, tuck in your chain
Rob a nigga for a buck and some change, play dice with that
Doubled-up like "I don't like the rap"

[Verse 2-Rock]
Yo, son 'll get his same two fucks I don't get
Other than that, we the complete opposite
He hot, I'm cold, he high, I'm low-down, he fast, I'm slow
Or vice-versa, Yin &amp; Yang, not from Atlanta, though
No, I'm a New-Yorkian, Doctor Kevorkian
Niggas ready to die, stick a fork in him
I got a shot for him without a syringe
To walk you up out of your misery quick as you go walk up out of your crib
(Damn!) Monster mangler, madman man-handle a mob
Of you mutha fuckas with a backhand on the beat
He, he, he, I will mass transit strike down upon thee with massive vengeance
And ye will know that I am thee Lord, Rock, damn it
The hot-handed, respec-onizing whether you can or cannot stand it
My Boot Camp is the best-est ever to do it, stupid
When you see it, you better salute it, we steppin' to it

[Hook-Rock (Starang Wondah)]
Here We Come, Here We Come
If you a dedicated soldier, say "Here We Come", let's ride
(Here We Come, oh) Here we go
It's time, take what's our, it's time to shine and glow (Hey, y'all)
What's ours is ours and what's y'alls is ours
Brooklyn keep on takin' it, we shakin' all y'all cowards again
Here we go, it's time, mound-up, it's goin' down

[Verse 3-Buckshot]
Sure, I'm the client, but I'm also the president
And I'll still rob your resident
Ever since I became a MC, I made change
And ain't shit change, I'm the reason your chick came
Literally and physically, she did it with me
Now she takin' seeds out my weed
And we gettin' nasty like sneezin' in food
Twenty-four hours on the grind, we in that mood

[Verse 4-Steele]
Yeah, 'For the People' we 'The Chosen Few'
Worldwide Boot Camp, pay-per-whole a view
Peep the symmetry, more then the symphony
Now each song is a documentary
The God's drop the epilogue for greatness
Took pain off faces, the rage mark pages
From the block to the cages
You our main inspiration when we rockin' on stages
We came a little way from beats in the basements
Stick-up kids, throw the heat to your faces
And even though we don't be meetin' them cases
But we stuck on these chases to get these papers
And the system is ancient, we dishin' the haters
Wishin' that our Clik never make it, but
We took it back to the basics
Mastered The Matrix, BC crashin' the station

[Hook-Rock (Starang Wondah)]
(Hey yo) Here We Come (Uh-huh) Here We Come (Uh-huh)
If you a dedicated soldier, say "Here We Come", let's ride
(Here We Come, oh) Here we go
It's time, take what's ours, time to shine and glow, huh?
What's ours is ours and what's y'alls is ours
Brooklyn keep on takin' it, we shakin' all y'all cowards again
(Yeah) Here we go, it's time, mound-up, it's goin' down

[Outro-Starang Wondah (Rock)]
You see, that's what I'm talkin' about, man
Sittin' here smokin' a Bob Marley the size of the Empire State Building
Boot Camp Clik, revolution of revolutions
(What's ours is ours and what's y'alls is ours
Brooklyn keep on takin' it, we shakin' all y'all cowards again)
BDI, reflection of perfection
You know, Starang One main gun, I'm out, yo
(Here We Come) Bucktown USA, for life
(If you a dedicated soldier, say "Here We Come", let's ride)
MFC! You know (Here We Come, Here We Come)</pre>
