[Bubba] Feel me

[Timbaland]
Uhh! .. Uhh!
C'mon, c'mon, ah c'mon, ah c'mon

Catch me on a, backroad, or cookin in your momma's house
In your daughter's guts, or just spazzin out
Me and Bubba know what the hell we talkin 'bout
Pickin up Betty's like they was beans and brussel sprouts
We got the clout to make you bounce a little
We got the clout to make you down this pickle, until you gettin tickled
C'mon Bubba let's surround this biddle
While you work the back bit Timbaland work the middle
Uh-oh, uh-oh!  I see ya see ya smile
Uh-oh, uh-oh!  Down comes your blouse
Timb' been around 'em all
From white to black, even magnoli-all
To hit 'em in project halls
In back of the streets maybe right in front of y'all (ha ha ha)
Timb' and Bubba is a problem y'all
It's like hip-hop, meets effin Tim McGraw
We two fools and don't take no mess
Bench lumber logs just to work the chest
He's country finest, I'm country best
Puttin lights out train, just get in that dress, now c'mon

[Chorus 2X: Timbaland]
Twerk a little, twerk a little, let me see you drop it
Work the middle, work the middle, let me see you pop it
Go on!  Witcha bad self
C'mon!  Witcha bad self

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I brought enough with me to start this bitch a college fund
Fitted Boy and Polo, and she ain't even got a son
Timmy kind of shy, told me to tell you drop it some
Here Betty, take this grand, get your monthly shoppin done
You can shake for dem but bet that you don't profit none
I got a coochie fart fetish, baby pop me one
While you by the bar I grab your boy a shot of rum
I'm the shit to the point you gotta stop I got the runs
Uh-oh, uh-oh!  Why they all on Timmy?
Uh-oh, uh-oh!  Ten grand is all they give me
Still got a grand left, can I let my hand rest
right there on your damn chest, fondlin your tan breast
I might just snap back and cuss a broad
But this bitch is truly blessed so I must applaud
In and out of every club in less than a hour
Sprinkle on a little Pervis like I'm fresh out the shower
Ohhhh!  And rest assured Timmy runnin with Bubba
We gettin slurped by two sluts right in front of each other
And we'll probably do the same thang next Monday evening
I gotta ride this Bentley home cause Timmy's out so we leavin, bye

[Chorus]

[female singer]
I see you, lookin out the corner of your eye
Come up here and rub up on my thigh

[Timbaland]
I'm comin baby as fast as I can
So while you're waitin won'tcha go 'head and talk to my man, uh

[female singer]
I see you, lookin out the corner of your eye
Come up here and rub up on my thigh

[Bubba]
Thank you Timmy, I don't mind yo' sloppy seconds
But when I send her back to you I bet we both infected

[female singer]
I see you, lookin out the corner of your eye
Come up here and rub up on my thigh

[Timbaland]
Bubba won'tcha just do what I tell ya
She got some good snapper (yes she do) damnit didn't I tell ya?

[female singer]
I see you, lookin out the corner of your eye
Come up here and rub up on my thigh
.. Won't you put in my mouth, won't you put in my mouth?

[Bubba]
Now, that's what I'm talkin 'bout!

[Chorus] - 1.5X</pre>
