[Verse Two: Young Jeezy]
All the above, and everything between
These niggas say they real, what does that really mean?
And I don't trust these clowns, some are always starin
You know these muh'fuckers fake as them chains they wearin (HA-HAAAAAAH!)
Real niggas stay aboard, others jump ship
Real niggas earn they keep, others lunch/sick
You niggas actin like sugar, might as well strip
Niggas actin like strippers, might as well tip (HA-HAAAAAH!)
Hatin get you nowhere, have a safe trip
And bitch I'm goin to the moon, I need a spaceship
Homey's in the big house, so I sit in my big house
Let you run your big mouth, 'bout things you know shit 'bout
I did it for the streets, I did it for the hood
I'm gettin money before rap, let's get it understood
Bitch I been livin good, the fuck I'm Hollywood
Ask Westside Blue, I been +Robin Hood+
I never been a bitch, I never been a snitch
I love some fileet, it always make me shit
See I ain't worried about you, it won't make me shit
See I'm only into things that'll make me rich
I lost my faith in this fake shit, stay to the faith shit
But I be damned I lose my face to this fake shit
Deep in the matrix, so much hate I can taste it
You suckas can't take it, my life finish my break {?}

[Outro: T-Pain]
All The above (OH OH!!!!) All the above (OH OH!!!!)
All the aboooooooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee!!!!! 
All The above (OH OH!!!!) All the above (OH OH!!!!)
All the aboooooooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee!!!!!
