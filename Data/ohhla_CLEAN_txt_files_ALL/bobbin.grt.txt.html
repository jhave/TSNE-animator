Typed by: AZ Lyrics

(This is how we overcome)
so yo' (everything's gonna go ma way)
we're here (doing this from the mornin' sun)
ma light (up until the break of day)

[Pre-chorus]
All the spies, we grows
on the side, oo-oh-oh-oh
bone slash, away we go
Christian move, so watch it, oh

[Chorus]
Bobbin' bouncin'
move yo' head
we all need counselin'
we ain't scared
goin crazy, hittin' walls
He's here all night
ain't no pause

[Refrain]
Bangin' bobbin' bouncin', bouncin'
bobbin' bangin' bouncin', bouncin'
bangin' bobbin' bouncin', bouncin'
bobbin' bangin' bouncin', bouncin'

Told ya'll we had a lil' bounce to bang, and out your range
it ain't comin' out the same
we skitzo, over-flowin' dyslexic messages
meant for the souls, the flesh can't detect it
don't disrespect, you just gon' accept
the south been hot, rich men preppin'
this our weapon bobbin' bouncin', bangin' beats and counselin', counselin'
every line inclined and designed, by divine inspiration and time
to speak to a certain situation, to those that hurt and in desperation
this the reason why we came, hollerin' talkin' bout Jesus name
so elbows and shoulders get in the motion, brake yo' neck and take in the potion

Ho

[Chorus]

[Refrain]

Ma neck snap back as a direct reaction
(people point), what is that son
parties gonna be lock a jockey
goin' up and down like the stairs on Rocky
revamp the situation, ma loyal subject surround encamp the nation
breathe life into the obsolete
break up the riff raff, who can't compete
overweight folk, lean on the rail
it's about to break, and they can tell
preach about the bars through the cells
speak of all the scars, times they fail
march to a different drum
free in Christ, no cause to get dumb
countin' on how he has lost his Son
this party ain't free, it cost a ton

[Chorus]

[Refrain]

Move it now, don't break yo' back, don't break yo' back
don't break yo' back, don't break yo' back, don't break yo' back (move it son)
don't break yo' back (until the break of day)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Refrain]

oh

Move yo head
we ain't scared
hittin' walls (break yo' back)
ain't no pause

[Refrain]

oh</pre>
