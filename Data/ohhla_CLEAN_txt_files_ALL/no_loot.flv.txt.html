Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

If you ain't got no loot
If you ain't got no loot

[Intro: Flavor Flav]
Flavor Flav baby, from 1998 to 2000, y'knahmsayin
Slidin through the molecules of wetness
Like a slippery eel through seaweed
Knahmsayin and I ain't playin
It's all in the message that I'm relayin
Yo check one two baby

[Flavor Flav - singing]
Now let me tell you 'bout this girl, whenever she walked in
Heads turned
She had a body that wouldn't quit, I mean she is the shit
And comin up was her main concern
Whenever she walked past you, your mouth would just drop
So if you ain't got no loot yo, she'll set you up with the cops
Cause you can't hang

[Chorus: Flavor Flav]
(If you ain't got no, if you ain't got no, if you ain't got no loot)
You can't hang
(If you ain't got no, if you ain't got no, if you ain't got no loot)
You can't hang
(If you ain't got no, if you ain't got no, if you ain't got no loot)
You can't hang
(If you ain't got no, if you ain't got no, if you ain't got no loot)

[Flavor Flav - singing]
You better watch out, cause she'll get ya
Straight get wit'cha, lookin for that million dollar picture
A scene that Ms. Thang would love to see
A rich fool on his knees sayin marry me
She's lookin for a Rockefeller
Takin money from that ass like a ready teller
She didn't have an account, so I gave her the boot
Ms. Thang couldn't hang, matchin my loot no

[Chorus: Flavor Flav]
(If you ain't got no, if you ain't got no, if you ain't got no loot)
She couldn't hang, no
(If you ain't got no, if you ain't got no, if you ain't got no loot)
She couldn't hang
(If you ain't got no, if you ain't got no, if you ain't got no loot)
She couldn't hannnnnnnng, no
(If you ain't got no, if you ain't got no, if you ain't got no loot)

[Flavor Flav - singing]
Now I can tell what's in yo' eyes, you wanna hit it
Just admit it, YEAH BOYYYYYYYY you know you wanna hit it
And there she goes again, kickin it with her friends
Lookin for the men, rollin in their Benz
Playin out their pens, they're showin to their friends

[Flavor Flav]
Yeah right baby!
I'll grab me a Lamborghini or somethin, y'knahmsayin?
Pork chop sandwich, clock or somethin
Came to see Alonzo Spelman, he he he
Flav glasses y'knahmsayin?
Bra and panty set from Victoria's Secret y'knahmsayin?
Put a Leer jet in your living room, knahmsayin?
You go with a ragtop, knahmsayin
Take you down to Toys'R'Us, get you a can of that silly string
Knahmsayin spray it all in your hair so you can have different color extensions
You know I take care of you baby, fake nails the whole shit
Knamsayin?

[singing]
You can't hang
You can't hang no, Ms. Thang no</pre>
