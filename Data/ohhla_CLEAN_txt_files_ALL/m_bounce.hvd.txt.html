[Heavy D]
One two, one two, one two
I am the Overweight Lover MC, Heavy D
This one goes out to my man DJ Eddie F
Trouble T-Roy my partner G-Wiz
This also goes out to my money earnin Mount Vernon crew
J. Daddy, James Huff, Pete Rock, Nick Love
Trak Boogie, and my man Chris Hughley
(You've got a ... )

A power, because my temper's at the border
Like I said before, I keep a party filled, like a bucket of water
MC, H-E-A-V-Y D
O-V-E-R-W-E-I-G-H-T Lover in the house, on the smooth tip
And I'ma rip this, then I'ma hop hip
Better yet hip-hop, cause you're a drip-drop
Small as a pebble, while Heavy D's a bedrock
I am the capital, H-E-V rappable
King ambassador with more, who's quite a radical
My style's like particular, extra-curricular
Sit back relax, while Heavy D sticks to ya
a new type of tune'n, risin, boomin
When I need a cut I see Scott, for proper groomin
I'ma go on and flow on and turn my microphone on
then blow on to make sure, the sound is strong!
So y'all get up, keep your head up, and then gear up
Heav' is in the funk, the Boyz in the back will fold the rear up
MC's in my path I'ma steadily pounce
Heavy D's in effect.. with more bounce to the ounce

[Chorus: Heavy D]
  "More bounce, to the ounce" -&gt; Zapp
More bounce to the ounce!
  "More bounce, to the ounce" -&gt; Zapp

[Heavy D]
Check it now hip hip hooray'n, check what I am sayin
You'll be happy like a faggot in jail, when Heav is playin
No complainin necessary, cause on the contrary
of bein wack I will react, and others I will bury
I'm comin on STRONG while you stutter we're the (?)
Description of my rhyme?  Hmm, butter!
Better yet milky, smooth and silky
Don't applaud you fraud, you wasn't with me
When I started rappin, you wasn't even tappin
Now that I'm done, you pat me on the back
and say what's happenin, I love the rhymes you announce
Heavy D's in effect.. with more bounce to the ounce

[Chorus: Heavy D]
  "More bounce, to the ounce" -&gt; Zapp
More bounce to the ounce!
  "More bounce, to the ounce" -&gt; Zapp
More bounce to the ounce!
  "More bounce, to the ounce" -&gt; Zapp
More, bounce.. to the ounce!
  "More bounce, to the ounce" -&gt; Zapp

[Heavy D]
Check eight seven six five four three two one
Money earnin Mount Vernon, is where I come from
This rap is an article, started from a particle
Hipped up, hyped up, hemmed up, to be historical
An overweight rubbable, squeezably lovable
Ladies come to me and say, "Heavy you're so huggable"
Not only am I huggable, but I'm quite enjoyable
When I answer the joint you see I'm rather unavoidable
Plus that means attainable, all my niggaz that's got cable
Rope chains, gold chains, the victory explainable
MC's in my path I will steadily pounce
Heavy D's in effect.. with more bounce to the ounce

[Chorus: Heavy D]
  "More bounce, to the ounce" -&gt; Zapp
More bounce to the ounce!
  "More bounce, to the ounce" -&gt; Zapp
Much more bounce.. to the ounce!

{*scratching*}
Eddie F! Get ill on 'em one time!
Aww yeah!

[Heavy D]
Height; six-three, style - swing beat
Name; Heavy D, so just watch me
Car; Chevy - four by four Blazer
Favorite pasttime? Skeeze chaser!
Size; ten and a half, sometimes eleven
Place of rest after death? Heaven
Favorite dessert; chocolate chipcake
Favorite dance - mine, the Heavy D Shake
Run, my territory, I will say never
The Overweight Lover, is highly, too clever
Extremely intellectual, not bisexual
If this was a basketball game I'd win the sectional
championship, then eat potato chip
with a little onion dip, and then I'll take a trip
to Maui, Maui is a little island a part of Hawaii
I dip upon the plane push up on the stewardess say FLY ME
You never hear another beat quite like this
Done up real smooth with a lyrical twist
MC's in my path I will steadily pounce
Heavy D's in effect.. with more bounce to the ounce

[Chorus: Heavy D]
  "More bounce, to the ounce" -&gt; Zapp
More bounce to the ounce!
  "More bounce, to the ounce" -&gt; Zapp
Oooh-OOOOH!!!
