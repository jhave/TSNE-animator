[Ice Cube]
Yeah... yeah!  
Fool -- you know how we do it

West Side
Comin from the West Side
Nothin but the West Side

Ain't nuttin goin on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin six on artillery, you don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin, ain't no stoppin
Fo'-hoppin, ass droppin, Coupe DeVille
My truth can, ill - fool I got skills
So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

Comin from the West Side
West Side, comin from the West Side
 
[Ice Cube]
Chillin with the homies, smellin the bud
Double parked and I'm talkin to Dub
about who got a plan, who got a plot
whom got got, and who got shot
Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin out the window
Fool I got them bomb-ass tapes
Da Lench Mob, _Planet of the Apes_
I'm down with Eiht, and _Watts Up_
Kam is solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want "The Bomb," just like George Clinton
S-K-D is down to catch a body
Put on _Knee Deep_, we'll turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

You know how we do it

[Ice Cube]
Jack B. Nimble, and Jack B. Quick
if you wanna jack me on a lick, cause
I'm that fool from South Central
You think you stuck yourself, with a number 2 pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With "Mo' Bounce to the Ounce" in the dash
Mash up, Ve-nice, headed for the West 
Everything is great, slow down for the dip
On a 100 and 8th and keep mashin
Don't drink and drive to keep the fo' from crashin
Stashin a glock and I thought you knew it
You know how we do it
 
Comin from the West Side, West Side
Nuttin but a West Side
It's hittin on the West Side
Fool, you know how we do it</pre>
