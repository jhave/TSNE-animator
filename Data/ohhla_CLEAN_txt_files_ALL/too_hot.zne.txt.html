[Verse 1]
Often caught up in the game, how can I explain
But no pain no gain so I can't complain
If it's not a plane it's a train, I'm switchin' lanes
On the road to the riches in the speed lanes
And if I clash or colide with the other side
Livin my life why cause my passengers got ??? 
kept myeyes on the prize looking straight ahead
Showing me the ass as I pass as the chicks said

[Chorus]
Too Hot Too hot to stop
baby gonna keep on shining so don't try to hate it
Too Hot Too Hot to stop
baby better run for shelter if you actin' shady

[Verse 2]
I know you think I'm actin' funny right
But this real girl gotta get my money right
I'm here one day flyin' out the next night
U-P-S flight I'm only tryna live the best life
I rip rhyms who funess right hopin sex erects I bet
You wonder what the sex like
Grab ya dick now tell me if it's skiny or thick my shits legit
I promise I'ma hit to you quick
I'm lickin my lips and bout to go down but slow down
I don't know bout you baby you been around
I tell you a secret do you promise you can keep it
Shorty gon make a video and let me keep it
You see I'm only doing it to show you I'm true
Nobody better gettin wetter just by huggin you
Screamed out I'ma end up lovin you
Shut ya mouth get on the couch put this thug in you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You said I'm too young look who sprung
This thug like a drug and I got you strung
feel he rush is in lust when our tongues touch
Love is scary shouldent I marry before I bust a nut
I'ma hit you right you disappear into the night give
me a call when you want it you can have it all
I'm stackin chips and the dough will attract chicks
They pockets use to stay broke before I got em' fixed
never the less when I dress I begin the best see me in
the suit lookin cute I got on the vest niggas gon test
Run up in ya spot like callabine
Use to regilize seen ya face a thousand times even the tile is mine
ain't wild as mine we gon forever bump and grind till
the child is mine be my confidine while I live this
life of ryhme sharin ice with the wife of mine sure to shine

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
