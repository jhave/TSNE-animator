It's that raw shit 
That'll start a mosh pit 
Head bangers get to spazzin' out 
And be like, "Aww shit." 
[x4] 

[Verse One: Tech N9e]
This that war this 
From the King of Darkness 
Can't stop this mob shit 
Awfully heartless 
In a minute, toxic, caustic 
Coulda lost your optic 
With a millimeter boss 
Get soft in it 
Pissed off this mosh pit 

Einstein, Tech N9ne shines 
Behind thine rhymes 
(I'm signed to mine flyin')? 
To find fine wine 
I can design lines 
That'll get me to climb dimes 
(Pieces, them fine beetches 
Never tweet and just grind blind)? 

Get up out this pit 
You without sickness 
Better get in the back of me 
Before your mouth get split 
Never look at a killer nigga 
When you're on the curb 
??
Get to pokin' out 
With some ladies do 
Think they man enough 
With a gun they be through 
But if Tecca N9na said 
He (crew)? with it 
In a blink, I would do 
A 180 too 

[Chorous]
(We off what we all)? 
Sick and (frost pit)? 
Everybody bosses and y'all is 
NAUSEOUS! 
Be cautious 
We all trip and raw 
It's brawl til we fall in this mosh pit 
AWWW SHIT! 

It's that raw shit 
That'll start a mosh pit 
Head bangers get to spazzin' out 
And be like, "Aww shit." 
[x4] 

[Verse Two: Bun B]
In the middle of nothingness 
I'm the light in the void 
Sittin' on big rims, swollen 
Like they been takin' some 'roids 
You scared partner 
Cause you look kinda noyed 
Like I'm about to put hands on you 
Like Pretty Boy Floyd 

I got 'em sick mayne 
Somebody call a specialist 
Tell these haters, "Fall back 
And get up off that extra shit" 
Who want what with us? 
You gon' be the next to get 
Smashed up but your (cuffers)? on it 
You'lla buy the naked shit 

Quit acting like what it is is 
And it's gon' be 
And you got no say in this situation 
It's all me 
They know me well from Third World 
To Zone Three 
And we gon' take this movement 
From Long Island to Long Beach 

Two trill, Wes is on the horizon 
So when the sun shinin' on us 
It shouldn't be so surprisin' 
You know we plan on you demisin' 
So playa you gon' be six feet and under 
While I'm 300 feet and risin', 
BITCH! 

[Chorous]
(We off what we all)? 
Sick and (frost pit)? 
Everybody bosses and y'all is 
NAUSEOUS! 
Be cautious 
We all trip and raw 
It's brawl til we fall in this mosh pit 
AWWW SHIT! 

It's that raw shit 
That'll start a mosh pit 
Head bangers get to spazzin' out 
And be like, "Aww shit."
