Lovers, stealers, thugs, killas

Wild coyotes, them No Limit swangers

Take it outside (what, what) take it outside (what, what)
Take it outside (what, what) take it outside (what, what)

We don't give a fuck boy! They scared to bust boy!
We on the grind boy! With that high boy!

[Verse 2]
Duck down when you see me, I'm ready to ride

Come in, stuntin figga then I'm takin your life
And if you owe me somethin wodie then I want it tonight
Cause I'm a, real soldier, thought I told ya
Lay ya down for the White Coca-Cola

[Chorus]
Take it outside (what, what) take it outside (what, what)
Take it outside (what, what) take it outside (what, what)
