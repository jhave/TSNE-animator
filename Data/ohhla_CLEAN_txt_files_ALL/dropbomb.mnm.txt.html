[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah boy
Dem better ring the alarm boy
Dem know what's comin boy
Buck, buck-buck! Ha ha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Eminem]
Oh my God, fuckin bumbaclaat, I'm hard as Kenard
The little boy who shot Omar in "The Wire"
Tie a whore up with barbwire in nothin but a bra boy
I'm the real deal and charbroil her on the bonfire
And bon voyage bitch, I'm like Chef Boyar-
-dee in this bitch, send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for ya boy, you think you're Tom Sawyer
'til I pull ya out the fuckin storybook and stomp on ya
Fuckin fictitional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourself for Captain America on ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact boy beware it's real
Them lyrics you wield equals zero to a hero's shield
Mister Fly-by-the-Seat-of-His-Pants parasail
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounce and grab a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearin zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no nada
Like your fa-da fucking your ma-da

[Chorus 2X: Eminem]
Drop, the bomb on 'em - please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop, the bomb on 'em - I don't want no doggone beef
See? Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me

[Eminem]
Boy I'm the Real McCoy, you lil' boys can't even fill voids
Party's over kids, kill the noise, here come the killjoys
Me and Dre the steel alloys, the rap crown royals
who scalp cowboys, now how that sound for ya?
Yeah boy, you know we're 'bout to put it down for ya
So kick ya shoes off in the foyer, have a sound voyage
And sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&amp;R and marinate in some marinara
And have a Coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar
of whip-ass of ya, that's the last straw you're hopin to draw
Yeah you fresher than most, boy I'm just doper than all
Boy I'm that boy, boy dem boys, dem no up to par
I just show up, go up to the stage and blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy I'm a star
Boy I told you boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm DeShaun
Holton in this bitch, I'm the +Proof+ boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy ya boy, fuck around and blow ya to sod
Oh my God, boy ya didn't go there, no you did not!
I got a whole storyboard for ya, boy you're the plot
You're gettin got whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology, not accepted boy Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin ain't no tellin at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point at the spot, when the bomb drops
boy does it drop, and when it does boy there's a problem

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Boy don't jinx yourself, boy I'm Michael Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell boy, my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringin hell boy, singin telegrams'll get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy in a black and red little sweater
Back better than ever, the cheddar shredder, the grater
The beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Givin haters incubators, think ya made a mistake
by sayin Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin place to Beirut in a day
So hey, wouldn't ya say I'm the shit? Couldn't agree with ya more 
if you were to say that my fuckin shit doesn't stink
Shady fuckin Aftermath boy, the ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin water 'til we fill up the tank

[Chorus]</pre>
