Somebody gon get whet up, does this look like a set up?
See that bitch over there? [yeah] she tryin to get attention
[LF] Watch them niggas to your left
[BD] Oh see you mention
[LF] And they flinchin
Get down, hit the ground, goddamnn, my gun jammed
Why the Hill Street Blues make me refuse to leave my man
[BD] Nigga leave, when I jump up and squeeze, nigga breeze
Down the stairs, get Pacino and Bees and more toast
They gettin close, BLAU! nigga Larry, CLAK, CLAK!
These niggas, BLAU, BLAU, BLAU, BLAU, BLAU!! should be buried
[LF] The situation's a tough decision
I'm going to get some more ammunition so we can continue this mission

[scratches]

[LF] Bring it to 'em kid
[Teflon] Catch them niggas before they slide
[LF] True dat, you get the front, I creep from the side
Take 'em down, soon as you hit the dough, let your shit go

[LF] What now, let them slugs calm your nerves
Let's motivate
[BD] Wait, Pacino still chasin
[LF] We bringin this home, leave him alone kid he lacin 'em
That's how it is when it's time to roll
M.O.P.! Home never fold
[BD] You try to set us up, dumpin you a sin, I'ma
[LF] Chill nigga you know we gon see them chumps again

[scratches]

[LF] Five - O, go

[LF] Where yours
[BD] I just left my shit right there under the bammer

[BD] It aint no time for debatin, why go straight when
You know the man gon be waitin, dip in the building
[LF] What if the door's locked
[BD] Damn, we can't stop the cops is surrounding the block, and
Them chumps are comin fast, nigga dip in the building
Hit the hazard and bear last
[LF] Nigga they right behind us, I aint tryin to get caught by the law

Five - O comin it's us, let us in nigga
Lock the door, cut them lights off
[BD] Stash the crack, crack the safe, and see where them chumps is at
[LF] They all over the place and we facin hard times at trial
