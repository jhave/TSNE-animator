[Drake - Verse 1ne]
Hey there, pretty girl
You know, exactly what you got 
and I don't, blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the lights so bright 
and the money so right
And it's comin in every single night
She don't wanna leaveee-eee-eee-eeE-EEE-EEE-EEE
She just stuck in...

[Chorus]
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song 
and she dance, to this song 
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go dooooown..." 
Oohh-ohhh-ohh...

[Drake - Verse 2wo]
She doesn't ever worry 
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows, there's more to life 
and she's scared, of ending up alone
Throw your ones up in the air...
Throw your ones up in the air for her...
Throw your ones up in the air... 
'cause the ones you throw will get her out of..

[Chorus]

[Drake - Rap Verse]
We all got dreams and we all star reachin 
All start peakin, all-star weekend
One hotel room, and all y'all sleepin 
Housekeeping knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin 
Never satisfied wit a nice calm evening
You be at the games lookin right, all season
Butchu always with me, on the night y'all leavin
Ass low, ass low, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who...
...or why, or how, or when
Tonight is prol'ly 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh... because I never had you...
Although I would be glad to...
I probably go and tattoo... 
yo' name on my heart 
I swear, I start, to think, that I'm going crazy... {*echoes*}

...

Throw your ones up in the air...
Throw your ones up in the air for her...
Throw your ones up in the air... 
'cause the ones you throw will get her out of..

[Chorus]</pre>
