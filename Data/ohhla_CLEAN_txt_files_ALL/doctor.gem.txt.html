Doctor, doctor, what's going on?
Can you tell me what's going on?
Everything keeps going, going, going wrong
Doctor, doctor, I'm out of time
And I keep looking for a sign
I keep getting closer, closer, closer to the other side
I think I'm running out of time, running out of time
Looking for a sign, looking for a sign
Can you tell me what's going on
Anything's that going on
Can't seem to tell what's going on, going on, going on
 
Can you me where I'm going
Am I going down
What am I supposed to feel
Am I having doubts
Life is not always showing
Am I safe and sound
The truth and what is really real
See I'm living all alone
Playing solitaire 
But it's kinda hard
When all the cards ain't there
And I'm starting to dig
All the voices inside my head
Yeah
 
Doctor, doctor, what's going on?
Can you tell me what's going on?
Everything keeps going, going, going wrong
Doctor, doctor, I'm out of time
And I keep looking for a sign
I keep getting closer, closer, closer to the other side
I think I'm running out of time, running out of time
Looking for a sign, looking for a sign
Can you tell me what's going on
Anything's that going on
Can't seem to tell what's going on, going on, going on
 
Seems I am always thinking 
Of many things
Of how my life used to be
I'm doubting me
Before my world started sinking
I don't wanna drown
I used to feel so free
But now my back's against the wall
Can't see light at all
Every time I try and play pool
It takes my ball
And I don't care about nothing at all
Yeah
 
Doctor, doctor, what's going on?
Can you tell me what's going on?
Everything keeps going, going, going wrong
Doctor, doctor, I'm out of time
And I keep looking for a sign
I keep getting closer, closer, closer to the other side
I think I'm running out of time, running out of time
Looking for a sign, looking for a sign
Can you tell me what's going on
Anything's that going on
Can't seem to tell what's going on, going on, going on
 
Bizzy Bone:
 
And you're losing your mind 
Trying find out what's going on
Whole wide world
Baby get up 
But she's hurt all over
And you're losing your mind 
Trying find out what's going on
Whole wide world
Baby get up 
But she's hurt all over
 
I don't care about nothing, nothing, nothing
