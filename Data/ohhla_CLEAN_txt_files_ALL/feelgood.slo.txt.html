[Intro]
(I love you daddy~!)
Awww, I love you too
Hood nigga; yeah, I told you I would
I told you I would - hey!
Hey, ay

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It feels good to be here {*3X*}
I musta done somethin right here, the kid right here

[Shawty Lo]
Ninety-three, my granny left me
So confused, my home is the streets
For although I chose to stand
I was like, "Damn what about me, and?"
A young teen forced to be, a grown man
Who idol was Michael Jordan, not a dopeman
"Dopeman, Dopeman" yet it's me
And ever since I heard that, yeah that's me
A 9th grade dropout, got a rock at the park
Me and Kurt ridin dirt, servin slims out the car
Dope boy fresh boy man I swear I was ballin
Fit from Kel, got my kicks from Walter

[Chorus]

[Shawty Lo]
They say I lucked up to get where I am
Real talk nigga I'm the man
(?) can't understand
Grindin every nigga if I didn't, did and
Yeahhh, I ran the bitch like Nino
See Lo man but my real name Carlo
Hood rich nigga comin straight from the kennel
(?) Street, Shawty Lo, Jay Leno
Yeah I'm im-proved
I made it do the do
D4L, who would ever knew
I musta dona something right, right? Yeahhhh

[Chorus]

[Shawty Lo]
Oh yeah, I got love for you haters
You really motivate a player
Ayy, I couldn'ta did it without ya
On the real, still did it without ya
Grandma, I told ya I got'cha
You told me I could and you told me I can
Never had doubt, in your lil' man
I swear to God you're the reason I stand
All I'm sayin

[Chorus]
