Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
East Side 'til I die ho, fuck you to my rivals
Holy Bible, assault, rifle
I'm high as hell like Micheal
Jackson on propofol, Tylenol, howdy y'all?
Hatin' niggas I'm ridin' off
In A spaceship on gold D's
I freebased then OD'd then I wake up in the ER
Why am I such a retard?
Your girlfriend such a sweetheart
She gave me head in a cheap car
In the back seat, we are not alike
I'm a monster with a gun sir in a trench coat
Say one word to me wrong, then
It's click-clack, pow-pow, 6 feet under
Yup, put a little coke in my nose
Okay, I wanna fuck Marilyn Monroe
If I can't get the pussy I'll be satistfied if she
Let me put my dick on the side of her toes
M.O.B., no time for hoes
Dick hang like no time for clothes
After I bust, vamonos then I'll take these hoes at the Domino's
I crumble those pussy rappers then stuff his ass in an envelope
Shout out to my homeboys who can't smoke because they're on parole
Pour beer on the bitches head while gettin' head
Get so high, forget my name
She called me Jarren, I slapped the ho, bitch this is Fred
I'm gettin' bread like Pillsbury
The pussy can't be real hairy
If she looks like Chewbacca with no clothes on, that's real scary
I put the beat in a body bag, then throw that shit in the crematory
Mr bartender I'll throw a Molotov cocktail at your green Ferrari
My brains on the back of a milk box
Fuck y'all, kick rocks
The way that I murdered these verses
Fuck it, you might as well say I killed Hip-Hop

[Chorus: Planet IV]
So tell that hatin' nigga he can go and eat a dick
Cause to be honest really I don't give a shit
I got a burner for my enemies and foes
Cause I know I know I know just the way it goes
And if you see me pullin' up in with my clique
Just know we came to go retarded in this bitch
We got no manners, no respect, well I suppose
Cause I know I know I know just the way it goes

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Thank God for My Grandma's Basement
I coulda been livin' on the pavement
I woop a nigga's ass like Texas Walker and spaz on hoes like cavemen
Nah nigga these ain't Ray-Bans
I'm throwed off bitch like Rainman
Made a pussy pop then breakdance
'Til my dick kiss the Holy Ghost, bitch Amen
Christian Dior my fragrance
America caucasians' favorite
Nigger, put a fuckin' rapper on a grill with a side of collard greens and ate 'em
I'm still tryna fuck Candy Latham, now I can probably fuck Raven-
SymonÃ©, show up at her house at night with a side of that Canadian bacon
Yeah, As-SalÄmu 'Alaikum, Rambo gun bitch, spray 'em
Fuck y'all niggas still hatin', fuck these hoes don't save 'em
I keep a hat low like Raiden, get blown with Eddie Van Halen
Knock-knock, anybody home in my head, y'all hoes know my fuckin' brain's vacant
Bitch, I came off of a Wu-Tang, gettin' paper like Bruce Wayne
I got an Asian ho that suck dick and do Kung-Fu like Liu Kang
Blowin' gasoline and butane, my last album had 2 Chainz
Yeah I'm tryna eat every rapper, I'm a fuckin' beast on that food chain, bitch!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Planet VI]
It's Planet VI in this b-i-t-c-h and I see why I receive hate
Cause even back when I was me how they couldn't see
May ironic, so sick that it makes ya vomit
Ladies wanna fuck my pockets to make love to my wallet
Instead they said if I hoppin' on top of my dick like a rabbit
Pull my plug in her socket sit back I just let hot rocket
And you don't know how we to drop it
Is it a bird or is it a plane
Bitch, I'm more like an unidentified flyin' object, I'm alien fresh
Now you can see how an alien dress
Ain't no time for takin' a rest
Cookin' up raps when I'm in the both
I might as well put my hair in net
But I don't think that they hearing me yet
Should I yell, should I scream
Just so you could know what the fuck I mean
Didn't nobody tell you that I'm crazy
And I'm insane at the same damn time
Since I was a baby it was my plan of makin' the game mine
Throwin' up V-I, please do not mistake that for a gang sign
And I'm a P.I.M.P., so you know that I only attract dimes
I'm number eleven on top of the Richter scale
I'm killin' the game and spittin' them bars
So I should get sent to jail
I'm out of your league ho
Now all I see is green, pockets on Cee-Lo
Ballin' on these foul ass niggas, fuck a free throw

[Chorus]</pre>
