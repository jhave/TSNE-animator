[Intro] Trillville (Lil Jon)
(What, ugh)
Get on my level ho (What!)
Get on my level ho (You can't!)
Get on my level ho (You can't!)
Get on my level ho (It's Trillville ho!)
Get on my level ho (It's Trillville ho!)
Get on my level ho (It's BME ho!)
Get on my level ho (Let's gooo!)

[Chorus] Trillville (Lil Jon) 2x
Bitch nigga you can neva eva, eva eva
Eva eva, eva eva eva eva
Get on my level ho (What!)
Get on my level ho (What!)
Get on my level ho (What!)
Get on my level ho (What!)

[Dirty Mouth]
Just like I said, get the fuck back
Get up on my level jack
Braided chips is all I stack
Roll a seven, bring it back
Never crapped out
'Cause my pimpin' is too slick for that
But if ya think I'm jokin' then I guess
That's yo ass jack
Beat 'em down, stomp 'em out
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Dirty Mouth up in this bitch
Trillville, we represent
Any city, any hood
Any state it's all good
Wish you lames could get up on my level
But you never could
In the club, throwin' bows
Niggaz grillin' wit they gold
Mean muggin' hard, 'cause they crunk out the rainbow
BME, is the clique
North, South, East, and West
Get up on my level 'cause my clique is the fuckin'
best

[Twista]
Nigga I got too many stars, too many stripes
Too many thumpers, and too many pipes
Get up in the club, I'm a kill in the fight
Hit 'em in the mouth with the left and a right
Fuck yo boys, fuck yo laws
Keep lookin' at me I'm a hit 'em in the jaw
Mac-11, 30 caliburs, and SK's
And a trunk full of haters if you really wanna draw
See yo bitch, smack a bitch
Up that thing, then my gat to click
Bust yo dome in the back of it
Then I ride to the black Cadillac and split
If you don't really wanna get the picture
Then I gotta hit ya wit real steel
And I ride then I scream "You can't fuck with Twista and Trillville!"
'Cause we got them thangs, got that dust
When I'm in the club, guls hold that butt
Make them shorties wanna cut
Wit the spinners on the Benz, 24's on the truck
Wood and leather
You really wanna get ahead of motherfuckers like me
But I'm bringin' better cheddar
When it come to out-doin' motherfuckers like me
Nigga you could neva eva

[Chorus] 2x

[Don Peezy]
My, my Benz, look at my 'Ac
Loom at my Benz, look at my 'Ac
Get on, get on my level, hell nah neva that
Get on, get on my level, hell nah neva that
My nigga chill
Let a nigga know
Yo clique, one
My clique, fo'
Lookin' at my watch, time for y'all boys to go
I used to get in hell but that's when I was broke
Always crunk with my niggaz
Usually, always drunk with my niggaz
Usually, think this shit a joke, Mr. D.L. Hughley?
Pop a nigga mouth, how 'bout ya life
Ya feel like losin'?
Yeeeeeah, now take that
I knew you wasn't real 'cause all you do is chit chat
High and drunk, and drunk and get my, get my roll back
High and drunk, and drunk and get my, get my throw
back
Yeeeeeah

[LA]
Lookin' light off in this bitch
Ya still ain't on my level ho
Crunk as fuck, ready to buck
Ya better duck, we comin' forth
Get on the floor, kick down ya door
Skip, passed to me and I got the 'dro
And I'm up, post
So what ya know about the A-T-L, ho
It's where we play, "Trillville U.S.A."
These street times is real
Any city, any state
Evacuate the place or catch a blow to ya face
Them niggaz think they hard, sweet as muthfuckin' cake
A cupcake, a mistake
Picture dead in ya mouth
Now what we reppin' muthafuck'?
That dirty south
So throw yo clique up nigga, we stompin' it out
And if ya smell like trash, we takin' ya out

[Chorus] 2x

[Lil Jon x8]
Run around the motherfuckin' club!
