"PUMP THAT BASS!"

[Jae Millz]
Don't make my snub go stupid, go stupid
Hehehe, Millzy!
That AK like Aretha, it's gon' sing and you gon' respect me
You niggaz just good at playin gangster roles, Joe Pesci
That's yo' girl, but it's my world, cause she ridin me like a cruise ship
My flight land, I check in my suite, she bust it open like a new gift
We ain't from the water fightin but you will get supersoaked
My goons'll catch you in that ghost, and turn yo' ass into a ghost
My flow, super stupid, Forrest Gump, that's retarded dumb
It's from my lungs and my clique bang, keep the change, rich gang
Millzy!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
("Pump that bass!") 
Yeah, my homies still - ("Pump that bass!") 
Ha, my homies still -  ("Pump that bass!")
Yeah my homies still -  ("Pump that bass!") 
("PUMP THAT BASS!") Don't make my goons 
go stupid, go stupid, go stupid, yeah 
Don't make my goons 
go stupid, go stupid (go dumb), go stupid, yeah

[Gudda Gudda]
Okay my bass pump and my face pump, one bump leave ya face numb
Let my white girl hit, watch that bitch go straight dumb
All my Yola 8-1, been that way since day one
Plus I speak that cocaine, watch me bake this cake up
Wake up; y'all sleepin on me, bass song in my speakers homey
And I ain't talkin 808, changin places like I'm Aretha homey
Tony Hawk got grind, holla at my slimes
We don't drop no dimes and you still fuck one time cause we

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy]
