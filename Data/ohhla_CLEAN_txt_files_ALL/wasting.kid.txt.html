Typed by: SARIrish13@aol.com

I'ma pimp
You can check my stats
And rollin' a Fleetwood - Thats how I mack
I rock all the tracks
So the world knows
I love all the girls
Smack all the hoes
Show love to those who come real with it
Life's a bitch but I deal with it
I'm in it to win it like Yzerman
Could drink about 15 Heinikeins
I'm not born again
But if I was I'd ask to come back with a little more love
Well I'm puffin' a Winston
Drinkin' a four-o
Kid rock, and I'ma let you know

Chorus:
I've been sitting here just wasting time
Drinking smoking thinking trying to free my mind

Its been a couple of months in this smokey room
Eaten shrooms drinking Boones writing tunes
And hoping to get one of these mother fuckin' songs to hit
A little bit of love thats all I need
A little inspiration and a bag of weed
A seed to plant so my tree can grow
You know I left my girl cause I need that hooooold up
Wait a minute I'm about to flow
Like a breeze thru the trees you can watch me blow
Puffing a Winston drinking a four-o
Kid Rock and I'm gonna let you know

Chorus

I ain't no rough guy
Ain't no tough guy
Don't get out much and don't dress up fly
Born in the game thats all I am
Giving all my duckets to Uncle Sam
Fuck it
I'm free to do what I please little lady
I was born at night but not last night baby
I've been around - seen some things
I slept in dumpsters - got high with kings
I don't bring much - ain't gotta lot to say
But I got more time than Morris day
Puffing a Winston drinking a four-o
Kid Rock and I'ma let you know
