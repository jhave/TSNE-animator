[Steve Knight]
Thank God I woke up just another damn day
First thing I'm gonna do is fall on my knees and pray
We all eyewitnesses to some pain and suffering
Emptyin' our souls to sin to keep on struggling
All these fine materials fancy clothes and gold
Ain't gonna keep me happy forever so I just don't know
Have I reached the point of peace to keep that happiness alive?
Only God can change this bad feeling inside
I'm gonna live and I die smile and I cry happens today hey
I'm gonna see you on the Flipsyde

[Chorus] (Steve Knight)
I'm gonna see you on the Flipsyde
And it don't matter if it's right or it's wrong
As long as it is and it's all good and we're gonna get grown
And everyday we face a battle inside but it don't matter if we win or lose
we all gonna die yeah

[MC Piper]
Push comes to shove step with weapons and mean mugs
The worlds at war no discussion just draw your sword
What happened to peace all the angels are now deceased
They fell to the beast they was murdered for trying to teach
Lessons we learnin' a' have us burnin'
We failed to listen to the opposition and that's why we twisted with terrorism
Ain't no repentin' steady takin' but never givin'
So cold that I'm shiverin' frozen hoping that I keep on living
I'm lost in the system cut and bleedin' but bustin' back and stay on attack
Spittin' wickedly kickin' facts
I'm strikin' my match light a fire inside ya mind
You with me Grab ya sword and let's ride and I'll see you on the Flipsyde

[Chorus] (Steve Knight)
I'm gonna see you on the Flipsyde
And it don't matter if it's right or it's wrong
As long as it is and it's all good and we're gonna get grown
And everyday we face a battle inside but it don't matter if we win or lose
we all gonna die yeah

Got this I got this feelin'
Got this I got this feelin'
Got this I got this feelin'

[Steve Knight]
I'm feelin' this sunshine everyday
So why don't you come home baby
and everybody tryin to battle each other getting smothered
It ain't worth
it thirstin' for the blood of your brother
To be the first with no other life is lonely and undercover
Slow it down for a minute c'mon stop and wonder
Your skin ain't the only skin
Blood ain't the only blood
Dreams ain't the only dreams
This world makes me wanna scream
Life on the other side is day and night loose and tight
Hot and cold thunderin' and lightening least that's what I'm told
Gotta flip it and change it and rearrange it
My brain is tangled with strugglin' with labels they always try to name ya
On that on that on that Flipsyde

[Chorus] (Steve Knight)
I'm gonna see you on the Flipsyde
And it don't matter if it's right or it's wrong
As long as it is and it's all good and we're gonna get grown
And everyday we face a battle inside but it don't matter if we win or lose
we all gonna die yeah
I'm gonna see you on the Flipsyde

The game don't stop your soul is eternal baby I'm gonna see you on the Flipsyde
Ain't no beginnin' and there damn sure ain't no endin'
I'm gonna see you on the Flipsyde
This side ain't right I know we'll meet up again
I'm gonna see you on the Flipsyde
All my family and friends all my partners and all of my kin
I'm gonna see you on the Flipsyde
Jilad, Marcus Holland and all of my home boyz
I'm gonna see you on the Flipsyde
Everybody who didn't make it to see their little home boy blow
I'm gonna see you on the Flipsyde
Live yo life live yo life
I'm gonna see you on the Flipsyde</pre>
