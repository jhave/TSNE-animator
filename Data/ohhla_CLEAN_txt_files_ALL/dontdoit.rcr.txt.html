[ "Long Version" includes the following INTRO: ]
Yo Rich
How come y'all go ruthless
turn around and try to be positive?
[ D-Loc ]
Look man, people try to tell me that I'm ruthless
[ Richie Rich ]
So when I'm kickin knowledge I be frontin on the schoolin
[ D-Loc ]
But you're wrong
[ Richie Rich ]
It's just another song
[ Richie Rich &amp; D-Loc ]
and another attitude that we use to school you
[ Richie Rich ]
You know what I'm sayin?
A lesson is a lesson no matter how it's told
You can't teach a dog and a cat the same trick, Jack

Don't do it

[ VERSE 1 ]
Hitler was a killer, Frank Ward was the Mack
Felix Mitchell made money in 20 g stacks
Moses split the sea, King Tut wore gold
And Jesus, he's the King, so the story is told
But my posse, we keep jockin the freaks
24 a day and 7 a week
The Oaktown is always poppin
( ? ) tops, gold tones, the boys ain't stoppin
Not long ago, and brother listen to me
The kid on the block with a Atari
Was the most and he had all friends
They're playin game after game, again and again
But the times have changed and now comes the grind
The mixed up kids have to make up their minds
The slow lane or do they wanna move fast?
The dopeman, they say he ain't gonna last
The preacher, he's busy tryin to save souls
The devil, he wants all control
You see, life is to be lived on the right accord
So don't sweat it, young brother, when you can't afford
A Benzo, a mobile phone and a yacht
Because the brothers in the fast lane haven't forgot
There's a heaven and hell, you only get one turn
To live eternally, or to eternally burn
You're not a cat with nine, you live once not twice
So what I'm sayin is take this advice
And don't do it

[ VERSE 2 ]
You see, the book of life has flipped so many pages
The styles have changed over ages and ages
If it don't get better, then I suppose
The winds of life should blow the book to close
You see, the world is corrupt and God don't like it
And one day like lightning he'll strike it
AIDS is takin over and so is the coke
But the preacher's real busy just tryin to provoke
The people to give at last one Sunday
Perhaps it can make live better for Monday
And if Tuesday through Saturday you stay on your knees
You notice a change, the wind was a breeze
Other rappers had a chance, but they blew it
So all I'm tryin to say is, don't do it

[ VERSE 3 ]
You see, the blocks are crowded with penny-anny hookers
Fresh clean cars and real hard lookers
But lately I haven't felt the same
A spell so strong to be in the rap game
The microphone is like the mental high power
My wisdom gives way, so lyrics devour
The average, the best, the epitome
Anyone who holds rank of an MC
Will be slurped like the drink through a straw
So get the punchline, I'm down by law
Two R's will be given as a single clue
Richie Rich is rhymin hard and careers are through
See, the West Coast holds the key to the door
So obscene weak rumors should be heard no more
There are punks on the mic, they get paid
Well, here's news, you're bein played
I don't plan to be a king and I don't wear a crown
But lyric for lyric, my speech is down
And on a one on one basis, tongue for tongue
The judge's decision, your rhyme's too young
So mellow out, coward, McDonald's is hirin
My brain is in effect, in other words firin
Rhyme after rhyme, don't wonder how I do it
You had a chance, but you blew it

[ "Long Version" includes the following VERSE 4 ]
Suckers gettin jobs, they can't hold em
I'm a fiend for mics, that's why I control em
And dancin ain't never been my best thing
But I'm a fiend for music so I entertain
And rap is not the only thing that I do
You get me on the court and I'll run em and hoop
But now off the court, back to my sport
Rappin, the record that you just bought
Put the tape in your deck, turn your Zap to fo'
Rattle and roll and break, you know
California is the place where the hustlers dwell
But there's a message at hand that I'm tryin to sell
You've got an Uzi in your trunk, a nine in your coat
Switchblade, backfade in case you cuttin a throat
See, the life of flash holds cash but now it's dirty
And those who participate, they die early
The coroner's office is way too packed
Due to sub-machine guns and hand-held gats
Dope is for pigeons and pigeons are birds
So in essence, peep the final words
Don't do it</pre>
