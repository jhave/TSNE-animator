[Intro: DJ Premier]
Yeah! Married to the game!
Yo! What you know about these streets nigga?! Huh?!
What you know about this real shit?! Teflon, Styles P Da Ghost!
Come on!

[Verse One: Styles P]
Married to the game (I do) Mary Jane blowin while I'm carryin the 'caine (Yeah)
Cross the state line state time is on the brain (Damn)
Mansion and a couple mil' maybe I'm a change
Twenty four gone or your frame's not the same (Uh Uh)
Brain can't remain in your head when I aim and the barrel flood the flame (Flame)
Niggas cooked food somebody better pray for 'em (Somebody pray for 'em)
Niggas look rude you better got a cave for 'em 
Busy schedule but I got a day for 'em 
Late night all black fuck around and lay it for 'em (YEAH)
Cut his ass ear to ear drag his ass here to there
Bring him home kill his man just so I can clear the air
You don't want nothin but sure 'gon get sum'n ('Gon get sum'n)
Somebody dyin 'cause the four 'gon hit sum'n
Married to the game the husband she always want the blood drip
When she want it, put a dozen in your stomach

[Chorus: Tef]
Married to the game, holy matrimony man look at the ring
The whole thing glass and homey look at the chain
You love how it's flashin on me, shoot ratchets 'til the casket on me
Married to the game, holy matrimony man look at the ring
The whole thing glass and homey look at the chain
You love how it's flashin on me, shoot ratchets 'til the casket on me

[Verse Two: Tef]
Married to the game, I let the thang, burst
Let the thang blast we don't ask names first
Bitch I got chips! Why you clingin to your purse?!
Mu'fuckers mad 'cause we slingin on they turf
Put in work,.in days to the gang in the hood at first
Niggas figured a little small change wouldn't hurt
Start at you with dirt, look, I took my vowels
When out and tried to put the cook in vowels
From the heart I'm a Brooklyn child
And Teflon palm still itch when I ain't did a jooks in awhile
We foul, crooks then look at us now
And they had to get it down for awhile but I took it to trial
Now all I do is puff trees, Roll to plush fees
And look for a girl to turn to a f'd up D
Please! We could never see enough cheese
And if It's about some cake then we could discuss fees

[Chorus: Tef]
Married to the game, holy matrimony man look at the ring
The whole thing glass and homey look at the chain
You love how it's flashin on me, shoot ratchets 'til the casket on me
Married to the game, holy matrimony man look at the ring
The whole thing glass and homey look at the chain
You love how it's flashin on me, shoot ratchets 'til the casket on me

[Verse Three: Tef]
Sixteen in the clip, run in ahead of the glock
If we ain't gievn up nothin but head shots to his dreadlocks
I'm lyin, I threw the iron to his bread box
And kept firin should've left Tef in a asylum
Let's face it, Tef on about a safe grip since 2000 blue diamonds on the bracelet
Won some, lost some, tossed some, replaced it
This strip's got me a mess I'm caught up in the matrix
Thought I take the time to blow a L
And relax 'fore you cats have me go back to jail
I got more crack to sell, so I was gonna stack
'Til I cracked a half a mil' and then relax and chill
But then, the bills grew quick, and my crew flipped
On some music shit then threw it on a  massive scale
Blast yo' ass to hell if the bastard tell
We kick our foot up, 'til they put up the gas for bail
And still........

[Chorus: Tef]
Married to the game, holy matrimony man look at the ring
The whole thing glass and homey look at the chain
You love how it's flashin on me, shoot ratchets 'til the casket on me
Married to the game, holy matrimony man look at the ring
The whole thing glass and homey look at the chain
You love how it's flashin on me, shoot ratchets 'til the casket on me</pre>
