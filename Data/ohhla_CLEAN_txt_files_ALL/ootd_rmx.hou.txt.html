[Whitney Houston] + (Nelly)
Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah (Whoooo)
Come on (Oh, Ohhhh)
Come on (You Know that boy right there little dirty)
Ohh Ohh (It's the World's famous, Mrs. Whitney
Houston)

(Nelly)
If you rolling with Nelly, with me get your hands up
And if you like the simple things, get your hands up
I ain't bout no trial tribulation
And if you wanna go and take a vacation
Whitney!!!!

[Whitney Houston] + (Nelly adlibs)
Kick off my shoes and relax my feet (Relax your feet)
Hit the kitchen and grab a bite to eat (Go head girl)
It's been one of those crazy weeks (Ugh, Ugh)
And I gotta do something special for me
(Just for you ma)
Hit the salon, get a mani and a pedi (Ugh, Ugh)
Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready (Whoooo)
Got to take time out (Nah, Nah, Nah)
And all my real ladies know what I'm talking about
Sing!!!!

Ooooooh baby, baby (Yeah)
You don't know what I been going through
(They don't know what you been going through babygirl)
Sing again now
Ooooooh baby, baby (You need to let them know)
It's obvious to see (ugh, Ugh, Ugh)
Exactly what I need

(Chorus)
If you an independent lady, get your hands up
You wanna buy your own Mercedes, get your hands up
If you rolling with Nelly, with me get your hands up
If you like the simple things, get your hands up

If you an independent lady, get your hands up
You wanna buy your own Mercedes, get your hands up
If you rolling with Nelly, with me get your hands up
And if you like the simple things get your hands up
Verse Two!!!!

[Whitney Houston] + (Nelly adlibs)
Tonight it's all about me (Whoooo)
Just wanna set my body free (Set it free girl)
Never mind the T.V. (Cut the music)
Tonight I'm gonna let a little T.V. watch me (Come on)
Light the candles, aromas at my feet (Ohh)
Hot tub bubbles, surround me (Who you got back there?)
Mr. Bigg is in the background (ground, ground)
The Isley Brothers gonna hold it down
Sing!!!!

Ooooooh baby, baby (Come on)
You don't know what I been going through
(Houston we got a problem)
Sing it for me now
Ooooooh baby, baby (Come on)
It's obvious to see
Exactly what I mean
(She back ladies and gentlemen)

Chorus

(Nelly)
Come on, hush ma
You ain't gotta plead your case
I understood you from the jump
You said you needed your space
Take whatever time needed
To give you a peace of mind
Cause when yback rub home
I'm gonna give you a piece of mine
A backrub in the tub
Play in the suds
A simple walk around the park
And let you feed the doves
You my tender "Roni", tell the homies "No Dibs"
Cause "Every Little Step" you take is "My Prerogative"
Call your girls take an early day off
Go do the manies and the pedies, whatever to stay soft
Cause today, you the boss
And I'm footing the cost
And whoever else don't like it
They crooked, just stay lost
(One of those, One of those days)

Chorus

[Nelly talking] + (Whitney Houston singing)
Mrs. Whitney Houston (Oh Yeah)
That's right ladies and gentlemen
I said Mrs. Whitney Houston, ohh (Oh yeah, Oh yeah)
It's your dirty
I ain't doing nothing
I'm in the background right now
I said Houston, we got a problem, hey
I said Houston, we got a problem, hey
If you an independent lady, get your hands up
You wanna buy your own Mercedes, get your hands up
If you rolling with Nelly, with me get your hands up
And if you like the simple things, get your hands up
I ain't bout no trial tribulation
And if you wanna go and take a vacation, hey
I'm out baby girl
Tell lil' Bobby Christina I said what's up alright</pre>
