Ha-ha

What's goin on, man?
Chillin
Finna do somethin a lil' different, youknowmsayin?
Got my man E-Swift in the house
E-Swift, you wanna dance?
Alright come on, let's dance now
Bust it

Goin out on the rhythm &amp; blues tip
With my man Rashad and Bronick
We got Bob in the house
Yeah
And I'ma bust it off like this
On the first verse
Check this out
Bust it

Now dancers, here's another hit for your collection
Take a deep breath, let's start sketchin
Moves for the dancers to get into
I'ma wait on you, now here's your menu
Just order what you want cause you know
I can rock a slow or a swing tempo
So swing to it, it ain't nothin but a good feelin
And if you're willin I'ma tell you the deal then

I got to see you move it (on the dancefloor, baby)

Yo, that's how we doin it in 1990, youknowmsayin?

I got to see you move it (on the dancefloor, baby)

Yeah

( *E-Swift cuts up* )
(Get funky with it)

Ain't it funky now

Hold up, hold up
What I wanna do right here is talk to all the dancers
That call theyselves dancers but they really can't dance
I'm finna teach you how to do it, alright?
Check this out

Now all you gotta do is get loose
Yeah, show you got juice
If punks wanna jump, run em up and I shoot
Slick, slick poetry for those who got couth
And if you'll dance even if you can't dance
Enhance a rhythm that'll glance
Up against your body as the music just swings
Knockin out the suckers now who's left? (Kiiiing)
Tee, yeah, that's mee, see
The cool gangster, the gangster, that's me
So just skip while I make that grip
Don't worry about a thing, I'm on a dancin tip

I got to see you move it (on the dancefloor, baby)
Yeah
Like that, yeah, y'all doin it right
Check this out
E-Swift
I got to see them movin (on the dancefloor, baby)
Alright, yeah
Where?
(On the dancefloor, baby)

( *E-Swift cuts up* )
(Do what you want)
(Let's have some fun y'all)

Now keep on movin, better yet keep steppin
You know, from the right to the left and
Dance all night till your knee caps break
You can do the Biz Markie, then the Heavy D Shake
If you like to boogie from sun to the moon
Well, cut the rug to my rhythm &amp; blues tune
Just remember if the phonograph skips
Don't worry about a thing, we're on a dancin tip

And I got to see you move it (on the dancefloor, baby)
Yeah yeah
Come on come on come
E-Swift
We got to see you move it (on the dancefloor, baby)
Yeeeeah
Peace
I'm outta here

(Do what you wanna do)
(On the dancefloor, baby)
(I know you got the feeling, let's dance)
(Let's have some fun)
(On the dancefloor, baby)
