[Intro/Outro: Forest Whitaker]
The way of the samurai is found in death
Meditation of inevitable death should be performed daily
Every day, when one's body and mind are at peace
He should meditate up on being up to blocked 
by arrows, rifles, spears and swords
Being carried away by surging waves
Being thrown in to the midst of a great fire
Being struck by a lightning, and shaken to death by a great earthquake
Falling from thousand foot cliffs, dying of a disease
Commiting seppiku at the death of one's master
In everyday when one fails, one should consider himself as dead
This is a substance of the way of a samurai

[Christ Bearer]
Nigga I don't wanna talk
I own one, ghost gun, briefcase in this equilibrium
It's the killa on your block, melodic flux
War flock, of perfected, dead it, bloods chop it up
And the birds of a feather, fly together
Intellaced moving mo' murder messages of me and Leatha Face
I'm your retainer, your perfect stranger
36th Chamber, Wu-Tang banga
I hit the dust and bust a straight no braina
Heavyweight gaina, and a lone blown ranger
Welcome to the world I rock
Doing what in the cut, while niggaz know not
Grand theft, awaited with baited breath
Hear witnesses fear just as clear as death
In the twinklin of an eye, in the ways of the samurai
It's do or die, for the devil's pie
Now I'm phat broad down, received from mo' high
So beautiful it make you wanna cry, cry, cry
Power Equality, Ghost Dog
For Christ Bearer, Killa Bees, west coast God

[Chorus: RZA]
Yo,
Yo, son will you kill kill for sho, sho
Yo, son will you kill kill for sho, sho
Yo, dog will you kill kill for sho, sho
Yo, son will you kill kill for sho, sho
Yo, Black will you kill kill for sho, sho
Yo, D will you kill kill for shoe, sho
Yo, Mink will you kill kill for sho, sho
Yo, Christ will you kill kill for sho, sho

[Minky, (RZA)]
Ah, designed to cause disaster, the mic blaster
Cause atoms to transfer, with immediate report for you bastards
I make minds stagger, with this North Star golden dagger
I self Lord and master, represented in this chapter
For you phony wild actors, I crack ya
for tryin to distract us, in the west
transportin flows of energy in your chest
Over deep bass tones, in the flesh
Odd bones are rock clones
Repentance in the devil home cuz he divided the whole globe
Transform souls, told lies, we wrote scrolls
Now it's on, it's bid war
360 degrees that form the negative swarm
Born mentally and physically from the essence
Where North Star be flexin, questin, addressing
All minds that's hectic, no place to be
North Star trilogy, west coast Killa Bee
(Killa Who?) Killa Bee, (Killa Who?) Killa Bee
Killa Bee, (Killa Who?) Killa Bee

[Chorus: RZA]
Yo, yo,
Yo, son will you kill kill for sho, sho
Yo, Doc will you kill kill for sho, sho
Yo, Monk will you kill kill for sho, sho
Yo, Black will you kill kill for sho, sho
Yo, dog will you kill kill for sho, sho
Yo, G will you kill kill for sho, sho
Yo, Christ will you kill kill for sho, sho
Yo, Blacks will you kill kill for sho

For shoe shoe, for shoe, for sho, sho
Killa Bees will kill kill for sho, sho
Ghost Dog will kill kill for sho, sho
Wu-Tang will kill kill for sho, sho
West coast will kill kill for sho, sho
Blood niggaz will kill kill for sho, sho
Crip niggaz will kill kill for sho, sho
Black man will kill kill for sho, sho
White man will kill kill for sho, sho
G-O-D will smash you for sho, sho
G-O-D will smash you for sho, sho
For sho, sho
(For sho, sho)
