[Lil' Rob]
You know
Baby, since you've been gone
I find myself unable to, sleep at night
To some people, it's just another day
But the Lord knows, down inside, I
I just don't feel right

(Verse 1)
Love gots a hold on me
Think I'm about to fall, baby
But I can't let you see, all the things you're doin' to me
Remember when you told me
How you wanted to be free
And you left me
Me olvidarse de mi
What about me and all of my pain
Times I thought I was going insane
Callin' your name, you're nowhere around, nowhere to be found
Nobody cared
Nobody was there
It was just me
Sad and lonely, broken homie
I smile for my friends and cry later for you, just like the oldie told me
Remember how you treated me
You said you never needed me
Spent all your time deceivin' me
Why can't you just believe in me
Now all are mis suenos are pesadillas
And I can't wake up
From this state and I can't take heartbreak again
What would happen if I took you in, I would lose and you would win again
You want your cake and eat it too, what would happen if I cheated you
Gee, I can only imagine all the things that I would be
I belonged to you, but you never belonged to me, no soy de ti

Chorus: Vocal Bizz
Your love's got a hold on me
No matter what I do
I just can't seem to break free
All I know is I want you
Right here next to me
Baby, tell me is it
Real or a fantasy
I said your love

(Verse 2)
Come a little closer
Look at me
What do you see?
The tracks of my tears, because of you
And wasted years
After all them times you lied to me
All them fake tears you cried for me
Now you wanna try to be
Somethin' that you denied to be
Reality
Did live up to my dream
Never thought that you'd leave me
Torture and sadness, these things you left me
Paired when I'm lonely
Drives me insane, I'll never be the same as before you, girl, I live for you
Please say it isn't so
The one in love is always the last to know
Remember when you'd write that fool
Up in the pen
And asked me if I cared, and I said
"Of course, I did," but you went and did it again
Said, "He was just a friend"
But then, it was someone you went out to see
While I'm standing underneath the street lamp, wonderin' who is the girl for me
I never knew that when you said "I love you," it was just for a little while
When we get married, we'll have a big celebration
send invitations to all our friends and relations
That's what I wanted
I wanted to make you my wife (My wife...)
But now, I want you
To stay out of my life

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
Every time I find another love, and try to settle down
And build my castle to the sky, you come and tear it down
I treated you like a queen, how come I didn't feel like a king
I told you if you lose me
That you would be losing a good thing
I'll always remember that day in September
Cold as December
Leaving behind a fool, such as I
Teary eyed
I guess you had your mind made up
Now, you've got your fools mixed up
Tore our off legs up, throw them on the ground for me to pick up
That's the night you laughed at me
Threw your little past at me
Never thought I'd see the day, that you would see the last of me
Fears of losin' you, kept me
Holdin' on
But I got strong
You never know what you got until it's gone
Cuando
Te queria
No me quisiste
Cuando te fuiste, me dejaste triste
Y te reiste
De mi
Ain't it funny (Funny...)
Now you want me
Vete con su hombre
Y olvidarte de mi
No so de ti

Repeat Chorus

[Vocal Bizz]
Oooh, baby
Can't you see me crying out your name
Oh
Tell me, is it real
Or a fantasy
Yeah
Your love
Got a hold on me
