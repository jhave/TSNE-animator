[Master P]
Unnnnnnnnnnnngh!  He heh
Master P and Treach, nigga
It's all family baby
Get them Naughty boys, I got the No Limit Soldiers
And when we posse up, these niggaz gon' pay us

Chorus: Phiness, (Mystikal)

I thought I told you, have my mo-ney (Whatcha wan' do nigga?)
You got until sunrise, or lose your life (Whatcha gon' do nigga?)
We comin with them thangs, and we ready to ride
(Where they at?  Let's GET EM!)
Are you ready to die (live or die, live or die, live or die)
(Where they at?  Let's GET EM!)

[Vinnie]
With a little bit of taste of the bass to the face
in the place for anybody not payin-on-time
Rather be up in a six foot cell
before I let another nigga get flagrant-with-mine
And we be takin all cash, no checks, so go cancel this
I know niggaz are so scandalous
The ones I bust I'ma show em nuff ? on how many people 
thinkin that they can stand with this, sheeyit
I thought somebody told you, BOY
Them Naughty niggaz ain't no toys
You're fuckin with sixteen styles over sixteen bars
Sixteen car man entourage
And when we get things started, I'm the hardest artist
Styles I flips retarded
Family who can handle this
From Illtown to S.E. to Los Angeles

Chorus

[Treach]
Hear the tale, of the n'Illtown O.G., better know me
Shape the gold teeth, CD be, bring the clip shells
and Olde E and gats, so no one gets close to me
and down to scrap, raise em from that
True tradition, RAISE EM UP, and gangsta bitches
that'll blaze them butts, don't play for fuck
Now we had a dealer knock off joints, Julie's jackin
with the drop-off point (yo what the deal nigga)
You backed out, I fuckin WITNESSED it
And have partners have to split shit with
(Nah, pay me now, bust it)
At sundown see I went on work
I sent a tec mount in a tennis skirt, pop the blood claat
Watch a thug rock, slugs pop
With every cop on the block, with double-eye on my mugshots
He better pay me like he postin bail
or send his hand with no nails to his mom in the mail

Chorus

[Mystikal]
Don't look now, but I'M BACK!!
Now give me all my props again
I gotta kick your motherfuckin ass for steppin on my MOCASSINS!!
We blended with Treach and Vinnie from Naughty By Nature
It's Mystikal with Silkk the Shocker and 'nem
No Limit Lieutenant is at it again!!
Catch me in the studio, tappin in from it, actin bad with a pen!!
No blackin, no ant-draggin, no babblin
I'm grabbin the mic in the booth when they peak
I'ma gon' get me started WRASSLIN!!
Turnin and tusslin
Clutchin and musclin
I saw myself the demons when I'm BUSTIN THEM
If you wanna live you wouldn't FUCK WITH THEM
Don't FUCK WITH THEM

[Silkk the Shocker]
Ha hah, don't fuck with them, look
Nigga, I keep a tight show, Luciano type dough
Feature Al Capone's way out nigga, I got that type of flow
Don't floss, if it ain't yours
See we a bunch of feature artists, y'all a bunch of "and mores.."
Get the picture like Van Gogh, plus they done banned our tours
Catch me gettin my floss on walkin 'cross marble tan floors
Can't even touch the flow, can't even touch no coat
Bitch I'm made now, I can't even much touch no mo'
Fuck the whole rap game up nigga just, one of my lines
Say y'know a nigga like me, you're lyin bitch
cause I'm like one of a kind
From the Jerz to the five-oh we get down and dirty ya heard?
I gotta eat, so I gotta go to street, cop two keys and a bird
.. So y'all better have what you owe me!  By sundown
.. Or else I'ma get Mystikal, Naughty By Nature, my boys and 'nem
.. We gonna get y'all!
