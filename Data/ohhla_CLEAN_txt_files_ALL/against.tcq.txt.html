[Intro: Phife and Tip]
Back at you
Right back at you

[Verse 1: Tip and Phife]
Drove around the block, drove a lot
Lookin' all around, don't see no cops
Whispered in your ear, a ghetto star
Sittin' on my lap inside of my car
Lookin' at my lips, take a taste
Taste yours too, rub your back
Run your fingers on the logo of my baseball hat
Moonlight dancin' inside of your eyes
Close your legs, I start to sigh
Now I reach down to unlace my Nikes
Kick off your Adidas 'cause that's what you like
Chris Tucker joke passed inside of my head
Put the thought away think of you instead
Hot outside, it's hot in here
Roll down the window the breeze in your hair
Your earrings shake, you a baby doll
You say you want me but did you want them all??
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant McCoy and I'm real
Another brotha's fan? Forget how he feel

[Chorus: Tip and Phife - repeat 4X]
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world?
(Female voice) Hell yeah the world

(Female voice) Repeat 3x
Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Whole wide world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Whole wide world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world

[Verse 2: Tip and Phife]
Dame un beso, sil vous plait
Or can you hold my hand, it's better that way
If we was on video I'd press rewind
A nigga think about you all the time
Pidgeon dropped a note on top my head
R&amp;B,pop girl's a thoroughbred
Run around the track, let me slow you dowwwwnnnnnn...(Pause)
Pick you up
Raise your cups
Let's double up
Bomb came known, natural disas
Fall in love with me? huh, well that's that ass
Wanna get you, inside my world
Process, straight, afro or curl
Stretch me out, fade me in
Forever you in need let me see you grin?
He bust with you, I'm a tap his chin??
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant McCoy and I'm real
Another brotha's fan? forget he feel

[Chorus]</pre>
