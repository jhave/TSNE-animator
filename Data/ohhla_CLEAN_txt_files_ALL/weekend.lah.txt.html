Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love

	[Queen Latifah]
Have you been misled
Anything I said
Didn't mean to turn you on
The bite is oh so strong
You got things to do
But I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Mondays to Fridays I don't see you then

	[Unknown Reggae Artist]
A W-E-E-K and a E-N-D
And a L-O-V-E we were meant to be
A W-E-E-K, a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be

	[Queen Latifah]
Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love

	[Queen Latifah]
Seems it's been so long
Since you thrilled me with your charms
I tenderly imagine me
Resting in your arms
You've got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Mondays to Fridays, I don't see you then

	[Unknown Reggae Artist]
Because we're sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that ?
Once in a week
Sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that ?
Once in a week

	[Unknown Reggae Artist]
I know, you know
We all occupied
From our own love life
This has been denied
Many feelins high
Many tears of pride
But by the weekend
Let my spirit devide

	[Queen Latifah]
Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love (maybe someday we'll change)
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love

	[Queen Latifah]
If you've been misled
By anything I've said
Didn't mean to turn you on
The bite was oh so strong
You've got things to do
But I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Mondays to Fridays I don't see you then

	[Unknown Reggae Artist]
A W-E-E-K and a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be
A W-E-E-K, a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be

	[Unknown Reggae Artist]
??????????
To nourish and cherish every moment
To deliver the goods I am ???
And I know you're posessed with the ingredients
Till the weekend the days seems to be long
But by the weekend I wish I could reverse its time
Good things can come in a small bag
So let's make use of the time that we have
When we are together cos we stay popular
???????????
When we are together you and I wonder
If this love is gonna last forever
Well then I think and I start remember
That we are a ? star

Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love</pre>
