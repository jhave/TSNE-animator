[HOOK x2]
THEM NIGGAZ ACTORS (ACTORS)
THEY DESERVE OSCARS (OSCARS)
WE PULL CHOPPERS (CHOPPERS)
TO WAR WITH THE COPPERS (COPPERS)
DOG...THEM NIGGAZ LIVING A LIE, LIE, LIE, LIE
DIPSET STAY FLY.....AND? AND?!?!?!?!

[Verse 1: Cam'Ron]
Killa!
Let's get the riot on, acting like I'm lying huh?
Five years probation, possesion of a firearm (that's New York)
Did the county, bologna like it was "Ground Round" (that's Texas)
Zeke ran an ecstacy ring, he on the countdown (North Carolina)
Seran down the V, coke in the whip...he bought the Chaper (Chicago)
Notorious secrets? Nah with secret indictments
Jim indicted but Kelina from P.C could fight it (uptown Rucker)
Up in the peach, yeah the weed atleast he could light it (then what?)
THEN ZEKE SHOT (SHOT), THEN E KILLED (DAMN), THEN B POPPED (DAMN), THEN ME ROCKED (WHAT?)
Yeah, but we shooting back I'm pulling out the 4-5th
If I ain't get 'em yet, believe they name is on the short list
Yeah, nigga's nauseous, I'll show you just what nauseous is
We surround fortresses, studios and offices
You should be cautious kiiiiid....
'fore the boss of this off ya lid, R.I.P. right where the portrait is

[HOOK]

[Verse 2: Cam'Ron]
DADADOOOO!....that means drop it and run it
no fronting cause the coppers is coming.....like
DADADOOOO!...that's when we popping some bottles
with some models on our hip is some hollows (DIPSET!)
Before they shot they had to violate me (pffft)
Back in New York, my P.O gon' violate me (WHAT?)
Said "why you acting purish Nixon?", she said "you had no permission"
To go to D.C...you know that's out the juristiction (on my business!)
Ma I gotta eat...I don't know your religion
I got child support, I can't adore the bitching (I can't take it)
Plus some cousins in college, add on more tuition (education)
Said she got me on tape, flipping a quarter chicken (not me!)
Nah...that Persian white, murder type fur was right (about $20,000)
Huh, you heard the price, on my neck....hurds of ice!
Vertebrae snapped, gats...huh, I swerve 'em right
DIPSET! Bitch yes, peep our urban life
Like lighting herb tonight, cops come adjourn the site
They leave...U-turn...customers we serve 'em right!
So what ya life like?
Mine.....type nice like come off the white ice,
you...bum ass night fights! KILLA!

[HOOK]

[Verse 3: Cam'Ron]
Ayo I'm proving this, you losing this, there's nothing you could do with this
I'm disturbing the peace, right?....just call me Ludacris (Luda!)
I don't care who exist, the Exorcist moving bricks
Screw a chick....go outside and give the coupe a kiss!
Can't pop fly, I get my socks tied
I'm being watched by...News 1, Fox 5
CNN, NBC, CBS....creep in my home
Magazines, paparazzi....please leave me alone
Yeah I VV'd the stones, dog I'm into cake
I sell records but my real job...interstates ("I" WHATEVER!)
I been an ape, diamonds in the dinner plate
I'm a winner, fish in my crib....I got a winter lake!
And the fountain right, nope I won't pronounce the price (nope!)
But I'll be bouncing right near you on a mountain bike! (a hood near you)
That's where I hound ya wife, she see the four pounds of ice
But the four pounder right...BANG that's the sound of life!
KILLA!
