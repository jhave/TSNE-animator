[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'm a chase my dream
Coming to America like Prince Akeem
I ain't never give a fuck then I seen
High definition to get what's forever given
But nothing was never given
I build it from ground up
I started out form my basement and builded my house up
I'm rich off opportunity, money gon' pile up
My swag on a hundred mill, how the stylist gon' style us
Caught up in the light, caught up in the life
I see youngin on the corner with a quarter of that white
He just tryna chase his dream plus his daughter needs some wipes
And some pampers so he don't give a fuck about the slammer
He just tryna stay alive, clutching on his hammer
World full of problems, ain't nobody gotta answer
Mommy in the grave, daddy gettin' high
Bills steady rollin' in, he barely gettin' by
Same clothes everyday, he barely gettin' fly
Erryday he wake, he just swear to do his job
What that is? Chasin' dreams, time is tickin' so it seems
On his downtime he's spittin' and he's sick, his flow is mean
He just want his real chance, no reality show
But the graveyard the jail cell, reality though
Crack house was his crib, the streets fathered him though
And he ain't got no twitter page but you can follow him tho
Woah

[Hook]
Dream chaser, keep chasin'
Grind will turn into your shine, be patient
Yeah, a hundred miles and runnin'
Tryna catch up to my dreams so you know I'm Forrest Gumpin'
I'm a dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
I was raised by my momma
Pop used to beat her
Got a sister my age, my pop was a cheater
Gram's kept something in the pot for us to eat up
Had to open up the oven for the house to heat up
Christmas missed us, no birthday's or Easter's
Used to snatch bags from Halloween trick or treaters
Hot dogs and beans, fish sticks on the weekend
Shared the same bed that my cousin used to pee in
Dreamed to be the Huxtable's, settled for the Brady's
Black and white on top of floor model with' no cable
My sister used to punch me, beat me, slap me
Caught my first case stealin' cookies outta ackney
Raised in South Phil, 2-4 where you can find me at
Used to kick the machines for quarters out the laundromat
Dirty little teen, going to school embarrassin'
Gas cut off, my clothes smelling like kerosene

[Chrous]
Dream chaser, keep chasin'
Grind will turn into your shine, be patient
Yeh, a hundred miles and runnin'
Tryna catch up to my dreams so you know I'm Forrest Gumpin'
I'm a dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
It all started in the basement, me, my pen and my pad
Started thinkin' bout things I never had
Was broke as a joke, ain't never laugh
I woke up and went and got it, now they forever mad
How can you hate me where I came from
When just a year ago I was the same one
Them dudes you call your homies be the main one
You'd be surprised what niggas do as soon as the fame come
But I ain't worried, discouraged, I just observe it
When my dreams started to crumble, niggas deserted
Empty courtroom when my judge read my verdict
But now I'm gettin' to it, niggas act like they deserve it
Sittin' in my cell, watching my dream
Fade like Mike, fourth quarter, tie game
Shackles on my ankles and wrist my first chains
And now it's hard work on the menu, I thirst cream

[Hook]
Dream chaser, keep chasin'
Grind will turn into your shine, be patient
Yeh, a hundred miles and runnin'
Tryna catch up to my dreams so you know I'm Forrest Gumpin'
I'm a dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser</pre>
