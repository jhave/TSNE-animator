[Stat Quo]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Stat Quo, Alchemist, YEA!

Direct respect, due to stress I almost lost my life
My baby momma so much drama I gotta pay that price
I'm a trip, I hate hoes on one hand
The other hand I want me a wife
Cop the Jag then lace her with ice
Leave the mall with bags, yeah right!
Skeet on that freak then dip the same night
Fly a kite bitch, booty colder than a ice pick
Fuck you and your best friend, I'm quite sick
Plus it's my third leg make 'em throw fits
I don't trust 'em nor love her - that's some bullshit!
Ol' girl pregnant, now she's headed
to the delivery room to have yo' baby
Dawg, that's your lady - muh'fucker you crazy!
Fuck that broad, she's shady
Aftermath bitch I'm sway-zy
How is latex lazy, that pussy had my vision hazy
But Zaire's here, my only son and baby
I mean Zaire's here, my only son and baby

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I lost a whole lotta dollars, a whole lotta friends
Who can I trust in the end?
As the, love keeps spinnin, we all keep sinnin
All cause we tryin to win (all cause we tryin to win)

[Stat Quo]
I don't roll with a whole lot of niggaz
The mo' niggaz you roll with, the mo' niggaz wanna KILL YA
Thought they was your la familia
Now you're tied up blindfolded, and death is near ya
Fucked in the game and act like dames
Over fame just watch the change, change
Muh'fuckers so quick to blame
All the beef fly like planes, make it sayin the same
Look what +Ca$h Money+ did to B.G., Juvenile and Wayne
The root of evil with much disdain
Of course they go against the grain
to maintain, tryin to obtain big thangs
Jealousy and hunger make the tec go {*boom*}
Now you on the flo', blood leakin out your brain
Mannn, that's the way it is
That's how it be, that's how we live
Watch your back, cause these kids
tote ammo and they'll split your wig

[Chorus]  2X w/ ad libs

{*music fades*}
