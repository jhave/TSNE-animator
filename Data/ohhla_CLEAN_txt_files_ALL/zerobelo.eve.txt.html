[Intro]
I got no answer, I got no love
So my heart pumps icicles
No answer, I got no love
So my heart beats zero below
No answer, I got no love
So my heart pumps icicles
No answer, I got no love
So my heart beats zero below

[Verse 1]
Ayo, tell me why should I ever give a fuck
My time is money man and you ain't even worth a buck
Don't excuse the tone, this is how it is
Formin a cold blooded, and I don't give a shit
Got an announcement, the golden child comin
Straight killin em, boss bitch stuntin
These hoes crippled, not even in the runnin
Put out the feta so you know I ain't frontin
They had a little time, tried to be E V E
Snatchin the plate back, it's my turn to eat
And I'm a greedy bitch, man I don't like to share
Whole world mine, yea yea it ain't fair
They said I turned cold once I made my millions
I know you're mad, my success really hurt your feelings
No sugar coatin anything around here
Lioness, run team, who should rock here?

[Chorus]
I got no answer, I got no love
So my heart pumps icicles
No answer, I got no love
So my heart beats zero below
'Cause I'm a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold...
She a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold m...
'Cause I'm a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold...
I'm a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold...
I got no answer, I got no love
So my heart pumps icicles
No answer, I got no love
So my heart beats zero below

[Verse 2]
Isabelle Marant, bottles blood stained
From all these wannabees that thought they was better than me
Got em thirsty for it, give this bitch a drink
Iceberg dead ahead, I make Titanic sink
I'm just what they not, they must really all you got
You could never take my spot
Trust me, you don't wanna pop
Yea, I shoot, when shockin all reason that yo mouth drop
Fuck you 'cause you're at the bottom, love me 'cause I'm on top
I'm a fashionista, cannibal  I eat ya
History I teach ya anywhere I meat ya
Still tryna get a gig, baby I'm the feature
If you wanna wear my crown dig a little deeper
Hah, you ain't even in my league
Murder murder, I'm a kill em on this beat
Got em shook now, getting dirty lips now
Still you shine, guess I'm a cook now

[Chorus]
I got no answer, I got no love
So my heart pumps icicles
No answer, I got no love
So my heart beats zero below
'Cause I'm a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold...
She a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold m...
'Cause I'm a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold...
I'm a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold...
I got no answer, I got no love
So my heart pumps icicles
No answer, I got no love
So my heart beats zero below

No answer, I got no love
So my heart pumps icicles
No answer, I got no love
So my heart beats zero below</pre>
