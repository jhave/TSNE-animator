[unknown conversation which carries over from the last track]
That's black?
        Whattup God?
Aiyyo Shorty got beef with that nigga?  Word?
{*blam, blam blam*} Oh shit!!!  Yo!
        Hold the fuck up

Aiyyo yo, eight niggaz down (just enough)
Fuckin around with my sound (ci-ty)
Yo, bring backup (ci-ty)
Fuckin with me, and mine
Murderous

[Inspectah Deck]
Check it, yo
The world is shifty, we livin just enough for the city
The rough witty killa bee sting just like the jiggy
My Family Stone, foes attempt to gradually clone
Label them my anus and the casualty's home
And closed coffin, Wu stormin like the light brigade
ride the wave like Frankie Avalon
As I decipher AIDS crime pays
The law's long arm be tryin to strong arm
Walkin timebombs before I bomb firearm
The chalm smoker, I hit the dread with a poster
He toke with his own love and expose the black toaster
Composer was shook
I took your bad looks for joke get your back broke
Deep throat this murder I wrote
The antidote be seekin like a buried treasure
By every measure lethally inject your whole sector
Wanted dead or alive
Rebel I escapes across the desert sand
leavin no footprints to trace
Keep a war face, in your place
Conceal the baby knives on the North breaks
I still shine in shady times

Yeah, yo
We livin just enough (livin just enough)
Just enough (in the ci-ty)
Just enough, for the ci-ty

Yo, in the jungle
I make moves like Iron Monkey
Plots to bump me off D.O.T. be on the hunt for me
We stay hungry, for money drugs and guns
Ones who fake get caught in the crossfire for crumbs
Know the science be my Goddess
The facts tell gats sell like sex and violence
And break the project silence, a vision
This is way beyond four corners, escape this mental prison
Before we're all goners, now embrace the world
for the world war is ocean bomber
Visionary soldier comma
My code of honor, mind still start from the drama
Trauma sent the victim, witness them run, scream in horror
Military chopper come gun down the slum
The outcome do or die Son it's bound to come
Mentally aware I see truth within the square
The future's here catch me on computer software
Warfare's inevitable, Rebel I hold several government official
Issue thirty-eight specials, that step through
Like Nat Turner create a spectacle
I may die in the scuffle but I'm takin forty devils

We livin just enough
Just enough
Just enough
For the ci-ty

Killa Beez, stingin MC's-AH
Yeahhh, Wu!</pre>
