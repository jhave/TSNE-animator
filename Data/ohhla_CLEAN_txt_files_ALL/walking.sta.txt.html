(She, just keeps on walking, just keeps on walking, walking away)

[Intro - Kali - talking]
Yeah, aiyyo Statik
Let her go man
You really can't hold on to 'em for too long
They say the same way you get 'em is the same way you lose 'em, right?
Haha, true story, haha, I know
Word up, yeah, Kali
Showoff, Showoff, Showoff, Showoff
Uh, yeah, yo, uh

[Sample played behind Intro]
You go your way and I'll go mine
You go your way and I'll go mine
You go your way and I'll go mine
You have your reasons, I have mine

[Verse 1 - Kali]
I'm sick of talk 'cause you flyin off at the mouth
Once friends but now I can barely walk in the house
Love ends, that's why you gotta focus on the dollar sign
You can lose it all fast, look at how Dolla died (damn)
Life is a horror show (uh huh), livin is horrible
Death is a guarantee (uh huh), you go when you gotta go (peace)
Time isn't borrowed, no more tomorrows
Just a closed casket and empty Henny bottles
Times change, I'm guessin I'm just changin with 'em
Same old song and dance but this a different rhythm (yeah)
Shackle without the prison, I'm matchin my opposition (yeah)
Attackin the competition, it's nothin, they gotta listen (Kali)
All of my old friends, all of my ex chicks
Both of my baby moms and my next bitch
Fuck all of 'em, I just need my own space
Focus on me for a while, go at my own pace like

[Chorus - Kali] (Sample &amp; Novel) - w/ ad libs
(You go your way, I'll go mine)
Yeah, do you 'cause I'm damn sure doin me, yeah
(You go your way, I'll go mine)
I know, shit's changed but ain't nothin new to me, nah
(You go your way, I'll go mine)
Yeah, I really can't explain, it's just the way it is
(You have your reasons, I have mine, friend)
I know it's hard to leave but I can handle this

[Verse 2 - Novel]
"Peace love," that's what I told her before I hit the block
Yes, she spoke too little but her actions always said a lot
She said a woman need a King just like Coretta Scott
I know your swag is on trill but your cheddar's not
Damn and honesty hit me like a motherfucker
Life is like a bitch in the streets, it's sort of his blood brother
Try to hold you down from these hustlers and these blood suckers
Everybody came in and they aimin for our love, trust us (trust us)
And so we take a little time off
You a diamond, guess I threw your little shine off
Man, I need something to take my mind off
Then I see her on my Facebook page and I sign off
Uh, it was special for what it's ever worth
But shorty need a baller and I'm far from Jesus Shuttlesworth
So I leave this block 'cause shit gets hotter than a kettle burn
Wonder if she'll ever learn, man I guess it'll never work, so

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Kali]
Mind in a hundred places, my brain's racin (I know)
Meditation, marijuana's my medication
I zone out, that's the only way to escape
Eyes low, hydro, smoke straight to the face (yeah)
I tread the water like I'm drownin, tryin to get air
I can't breathe, 'cause bitches always cloud in my square
So pass me another spliff or pass me another beer
See rappin this is my gift, I'm happy to make it clear (yeah)
Too many snowy nights, not enough sunny days
Too much money spent, not enough money saved
They try to put me down, it only pick me up (yeah)
They try to knock me out but (but) couldn't lift me up (nah)
It only made me smarter, it only made me better
I only worked harder, stacked more cheddar
So forever this time is just a memory
I gotta go for now but she'll remember me 'cause

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs</pre>
