[Master P--Talking]
Told y'all
Y'all should of never let No Limit in this muthafucka
Cuz once we get in, we be takin over shit
An we gone off that chop-suy, marinatin
Blowin switches to da world (Bitch, fuck ya)

[Silkk the Shocker]
I'm bout the baddest nigga, no doubt
From West to the South, back to ya house
Nigga in an out quickly, stick ye for ya whole fifty (Whaaa???)
Nigga, I'm on bitches, qucikly
Niggas can't stick me they tries but they dies
They'll fuck around, I ain't lyin, fuck wit me, you out yo' mind
I'll slap you wit my right hand and I'm still writin wit it
Hands quicker than lightnin but fuck fightin
Bread, ice is why I'm slicin cake
You niggas need to bow down to the street king
from the 3rd Ward (Caliope, hoe)
(Master P: Where dat at?) Bitch that's it New Orleans
Face like an 8th Grader, ain't the bigga nigga, a wind might blow
But while I'm here, a deaf person won't fuck wit me if they don't know
Man, No Limit run this bitch like a marathon
Bitch, my click is thick, deeper than a whole Southern down baritone
How da fuck y'all gon' fade me? 
How da fuck y'all gon' play me? 
Thats how we made it, from knockin niggas out
Who try to fuckin play me
Y'all think y'all could but y'all can't
Thats money in the bank, how da fuck y'all gon' stop a Tank

Chorus:
I ain't takin no shorts
Whether it be in this rap game or the dope game
Bitch I'm still the man

[Silkk the Shocker]
I say hustler, fuck these busters
Who da fuck gon' stop me? None of y'all
Bitches be in my face, I gets the gun, run all of y'all
Cuz y'all some tricks
Stop trickin these hoes stop bitchin these hoes
Punk ass niggas be havin dicks
Y'all need to have clicks you punk ass hoes
I stay posted from sun-down to sun-up, you run up, you get done up
Best believe the spot get hot like summer
Cuz I be the man, look deep into my eyes
Bitch y'all get scared by the 6 foot 6 wise guy
Mr. like shoot it out wit the police
Mr. I gives a fuck, I gots this D seven-teen 5 a key
Birds, you haven't heard? 
I'm from that 3rd, bitch when shit get bad 
I put the dope up my stars on the curb
An start hittin fools, in the dice game
I might man, hit 'em  all night man
Cuz I'm all night long gone off that fuckin night train
No doubts, I'm in the house, outs the back when the police hit
No doubt they can't catch me, I'm out this bitch

Chorus

[Silkk]
I'm the man
I'm the man
I'm the man (Who's the man?) 
I'm the man!</pre>
