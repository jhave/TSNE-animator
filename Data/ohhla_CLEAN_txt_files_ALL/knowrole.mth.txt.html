[The Rock]
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?

[Method Man]
I smell it

[The Rock]
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?

[Method Man]
I smell it

Come on, come on

[The Rock]
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?

[Method Man]
Yo, finally The Rock has come back
Layin down the smack on your monkey crap candy coated ass
Enter the squared circle with the Great One
Most electrifying moves, don't change the station
Children and their children, they all chant
With the millions upon millions of Rock's fans
Get ready for the square dance, here's your chance
For a can of ass whooping, from the People's Champ

If you smell what The Rock's cooking

If you smell what The Rock's cooking

[The Rock]
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?

[Method Man]
If you smell what The Rock's cooking

If you smell what The Rock's cooking

[The Rock]
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?

[Method Man]
Jabroni, check yourself, you don't know me
Jabroni, go back to the gym, you're too bony
So you want a piece of The Rock? Make you crumble
In these Wrestlemanias, kid, we Royal Rumble
Telling us that Raw is War, what the hell you think we came for?
Just to play with these whips and chainsaws?  And sharp glass
I'll shine them up real nice, turn them sideways, 
and shove them up your candy ass

If you smell what The Rock's cooking

If you smell what The Rock's cooking

[The Rock]
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?

[Method Man]
If you smell what The Rock's cooking

If you smell what The Rock's cooking

[The Rock]
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?

[Method Man]
Yo, yo, this is it y'all, Summer Slam, Summer Sam'd out
It's Thursday Night Smackdown, there's No Way Out
Now you got a problem, with the Brahma Bull 
Time to throw Rock Bottom
Ain't no way to stop him
See the People's Eyebrow, ignite the crowd
into a feeding frenzy, they want blood now
Chinlock and chair shots, suplexes, legdrops
Finish with the People's Elbow and sign it Rock

If you smell what The Rock's cooking

If you smell what The Rock's cooking

[The Rock]
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?

[Method Man]
If you smell what The Rock's cooking

If you smell what The Rock's cooking

[The Rock]
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?

[Method Man]
If you smell what The Rock's cooking

If you smell what The Rock's cooking

[The Rock]
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?

[Method Man]
If you smell what The Rock's cooking

If you smell what The Rock's cooking

[The Rock]
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?

Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?

Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
