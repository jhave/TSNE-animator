[Intro]
Shake it down now
This is the remix
One time
Two times
Shake it down now

[Verse 1]
Remember way back in the day (hey hey)
When the kids from around the way
Used to come out and play
And the double dutch bus
Had you bumpin' on down the street
Tryin' to move your feet
While you shake your little booty
To the groovy beat (uh)
To the beat
To the beat (beat)
You hit the corner and you stopped
Hey y'all there's a party on the other block
We hit the jackpot
Jackpot (what what)
And it's only 12 o'clock
And the sun is hot
Free soda pop
We about to rock rock rock rock...

[Hook 1]
What's your name
Lisa
And where you from
9th Street
Where you goin'
To the party
Can I come
Uh huh
Ooohhh....they're playin' hop scotch

Yeah yeah
Come on and bop with me

[Chorus]
We were dancing all night long
We were dancing all night long
Music bumping and we're jumping
And they're playing our favorite song
2x

[Bridge]
I'm a big city girl
From all over the world
And I do what I wanna do
Right foot left shoe
Then you take it on down
And you shake it around
Bring it up
Clap your hands
Then you turn it all around

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Remember when we did the wop (pop pop)
And you used to make your head bop (bop)
Like it would never stop (stop)
And them other grown folks
Gettin' busy with the jigilo
Drinkin' Michelob
It was 6am when they hit the road (uh)
Hit the road hit the road (road)
Them fat gold chains and high top fades (hey)
Run DMC is all you ever played (yeah)
Shell toe Adidas
No strings (mmm mmmm)
Somethin' cookin' in the pot
About to hit the spot
Boombox
Play me some of that hip hop (hip hop)
Hip hop hip hop hip hop.....

[Hook 2]
What's your name
Lisa
And where you from
9th Street
Where you goin'
To the party
Can I come
Uh huh
Ooohhh....they 'bout to get it on

Wha what
Come on and bop with me

[Chorus 2x]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
This is the remix
One time
Remember way back in the day (hey hey)
Gettin' all cuddled up in the backseat
Mama said 'Buckle up!'
Packed deep
On the way to Six Flags
Happy
Countin' all the red cars and the black jeeps
Ooh wee can we go to Micky Dee's
We was actin' fool through the drive through
I was just in high school
With a dream of Atlanta
Had a mic in my hand
Spit like fastest green eggs and ham
Sam I am do you understand (wha wha)
Do you really understand (wha wha wha what)
Doesn't really matter what the circumstance
I just wanna make you dance dance dance
I just wanna make you dance (dance dance)

[Chorus 4x]</pre>
