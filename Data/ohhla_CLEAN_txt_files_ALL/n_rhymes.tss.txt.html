Too $hort why you say those nasty words?
Too $hort why you say those nasty rhymes?
How come you be dissin all us girls?
Too $hort why you say those nasty words?

It's like this bitch

Verse 1:
See I hit the studio ten years ago,
Screamin out cuss words like "fuck you ho"
Comin from East Oakland went nationwide,
I'm on my tenth album bitch and I still aint died
Wouldn't change for nuthin, gettin paid to kick it,
You could rap your whole life and wouldn't make a mealticket
Nigga don't stop rappin let the hoes keep hoin',
As long as I'm alive I'ma keep on rollin
Can't do nuthin for a bitch while she bleed,
You can put that on a fat bag of weed
And get high, nigga fuck these hoes,
I'll be singin nasty rhymes even when I'm old
Cause I don't stop rappin, bank keep stackin,
Wherever theres hoes best believe I'm mackin
All you emcees tryin to take my place,
Yellin "Beyotch!!" just to hear the people say

Hook

Verse 2:
I talk bad about a bitch, it aint that hard,
Never got the big head still the same old Todd
In every household niggas know my name,
Hoes love the way I kick that game
&gt;From nineteen-eighty to ninety-six,
I'm still makin hits, hoes ridin the dick
My crew is thick, and we dangerous,
You lick dick bitch, you wanna hang with us?
You better never talk down on a player,
I'm $horty the pimp, I got hoes everywhere
I get my cash quick you lil' fast bitch,
I take you to my house and get my ass licked
You say hey Too $hort why you rap so nasty,
I look you in the face and say bitch don't ask me
Nuthin, they'll never take my place,
I'm yellin "Beyotch!!" just to hear the people say

*Female speaking indeterminately*

Don't get me wrong bitch 

Verse 3:
See I got a gang of homies that I put on deck,
I make the shit that you bump when you in the projects
You can check my file and won't find a flaw,
You can ask these bitches am I really raw
Like Captain Fowl, I cuss you out while I spit in your mouth,
So bitch don't ask me how
Too $hort fucked it up came back again ho,
Smokin them big fat sacks of indo
I make a new album every year,
My speakers so loud I can barely hear
I got a bad bitch, with some big ol' breasts,
I like to play with them titties, lay my dick on her chest
And start strokin, thats how it should be,
I'm bustin' nuts everywhere but in her pussy
And if sometimes things don't go my way,
I say "Beyotch!!" just to hear the people say
