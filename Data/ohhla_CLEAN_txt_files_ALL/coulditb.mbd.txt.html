[Mo B. Dick/(Peaches)]
Say boo.
(Hey, whassup?)
Feel that?
(Yeah, I do.)
Awww man.
I know it can't be what I think it is, huh?
(Yeah.)
Could it be.

[Mo B. Dick/Anita Thomas]
Chorus
Could it be I'm falling in love again x4

[Mo B. Dick]
I got this feeling and I've felt it once before
Reminiscin on the time we used to wrestle on the floor
Writing poetry we blow each other kisses in the dark
Thinking bout each other even though we're many miles apart

[Peaches]
And I been thinkin about the moments that we shared
I turn to embrace you and I realize your not there
I see your picture in the frame, hear your voice callin my name
So I spend time with them other guys, there love is just not the same

[Mo B. Dick/Anita Thomas]
Chorus x4

[Peaches]
You call me every day to say how much you care
Whenever I needed you, my darling you were there
Candle light dinners on the beach hand and hand
We watched the sunset boy, it's happening again

[Mo B. Dick]
I did my thing, you did your thing and this is true
Life is boomerang, what you do always comes right back to you
But I'm willing to hookup and make it like it used to be
Cause I realize you are the most important thing to me

[Mo B. Dick/Anita Thomas]
Chorus x8</pre>
