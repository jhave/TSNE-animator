[Kool Keith]
Yeah!
For the 2000 (2000)
Black Elvis (Black Elvis)
We get raw with this (hand me my guitar)
Tour bus packed (tour bus packed)

Black Elvis, recordin in the 48-track studio
Madison Square Garden soundcheck, to speak direct
Fans in the upper level, backstage passes
Wearin diamonds around my glasses, leather coat
Thirty thousand from Wilson, countin the mill's
I'm talkin to Andre Harrell with a chaffeur drivin me around
in the green Rolls Royce, parked parallel, on Fifth Avenue
Steppin in Bloomingdale's, waitin for Celine Dion to get her nails done
Tour dates start tommorrow, MCI send the cash through Wells Fargo
Black Elvis, 28 G's a night
Tour bus with the Motley Crue, who gon' stop who?
Rock star don't need no tattoo
Guitar out of the sharp, Fender bass with the Stratocaster
With Prodigy, Rage Against the Machine, flyin over the Atlantic ocean
with the potion

Chorus: Kool Keith

Black Elvis, rock star, walkin down Broadway
	What y'all thinkin about?
Black Elvis, rock star, walkin down Broadway
	Chillin in the project hallway

(repeat 1.5X)

[Kool Keith]
Tour bus, painted neon green with black wheels
We do big wheels, count big head Franklin bills
Movin up that's when I'm Black Elvis at the Civic Center
Promoter book venues that are too small, ignore the call
Seventy thousand jam packed arenas
with rock fans wearin backpacks
Merchandise sell nice gold shirts with red lights
Sponsored by Dial soap and a Heineken
The biggest rock star gon' rhyme again
Roadie cases for eight months, Samsonite suitcases
Rappers comin home with no money on the red eye with dead eyes
Stadium tickets, watch scalpers get wicked
Pull up in my limo ejecting your demo (your demo)
Stretch lamborghinis with four doors, with four floors
Followin right behind yours, basic Continental
Get out your rental before I get mental
(Yeah baby)

Chorus 2X

[Kool Keith]
Huge signs on highways, you see the biggest advertisements
I'm at Tim Mandelbaum's office getting my next assignment
Walk in the Sony building, grab checks
Stop in a Hilton, Warner Brothers/Chapell on the back
of my royalty statements, my name is Matthew
Three apartments on the West with 200 songs
Five minutes each on Ampex reels
At the Shark Bar chewin billionaire meals
At the Apollo, can you digest?
I'm a hard act to swallow
with a Paris France model, with a real estate agent
that's building me a kid's playground in Denver, Colorado
Vacation unknown when I'm speakin 3-way with Roberto Duran
and Sugar Ray Leonard on the cellular phone
Upstate Connecticut, hold you rap style with a better grip
(I'm a rock star now)

Chorus 2X</pre>
