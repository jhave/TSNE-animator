[Noreaga &amp; Pharrell]
Bounce wit me, bounce, bounce, bounce 2x
Yeah Yeah 2x
Oh Oh No No 2x
WHAT WHAT WHAT 2x

[Noreaga]
I bust to the scening cuss to the scening 
I admit a little bit I lust for the crideam
Everytime you see me see me biggin up my teaming
on the dream of winning trying to make crideam
Thugged out even when you catch me in the cuisine
my clan mad dirty yall too cliddean (clean)
Hennessey and Smirnoff make a nigga middean (mean)
I need two more like I was a fiddean (fiend)
Drinks galore everytime I'm in the citting (city)
0 to 60 didn't want a sixteening
You see it in my coats or you see it in my jizzeans (jeans)
you can't tell you should know the way I lizzean (lean)
Water so clear I think I'm in Carribbing (Carribbean)
everybody gone like we straight clipping
you better watch out when we start flipping
seen you fuckin and you know we're not slipping

[Chorus] 2x
Ohh Oh No No WHAT WHAT WHAT
Ohh Oh No NO WHAT WHAT WHAT

[Noreaga]
Ayo verse 2 coming with my Heineken brew
N O R putting people back in I C U
You ain't even thiddink that I need a driddink
hit you up quick before you could even bliddink
Give you a splitting cut you up with the shiddank
tell your accountant to go and just check the biddank
I damn near broke you and I ain't even thiddink
I gotta churrda lurrda girls like Shabba Riddanks
Guaranteed to be there just like Fed Ex
We write our own rhymes kid you can check the credits
me and Nature stay fuckin with grimlettes
yo the hood baddest the bitches pussy is the fattest
Smack Smack Smack Smack peep Gladys
if you don't know yo then I don't know
I'm gonna get me some head right after the show
you can meet me at the room shit 664

[Chorus]
Oh Oh No No WHAT WHAT WHAT
Oh Oh No No WHAT WHAT WHAT

[Pharrell] 2x

[Noreaga]
It's all goodnud do my songs for the hoodnud

Yo you try to dis me ya man told you that you shouldnud
I blew over you and I told you that I couldnud
Me and Drag pack it Neptunes on the wheels

People walkin in my section that I don't even know
I'm like get lost yo you stay ya ass home
You a frizzeak always see you in the strizzeet
walkin walkin til you get widdeak
You on the E train 7 train plus the bus
I don't even like you cuz you can't be trust
You need to get up out my face ain't nuttin to discuss

[Chorus] 2x
Oh Oh No No WHAT WHAT WHAT
Oh Oh No No WHAT WHAT WHAT

[Pharrell] 2x
I told yall flippers all of yall quitters

Cuz I hang with go getters straight flow spitters
crys and mo sippers carry yo niggas</pre>
