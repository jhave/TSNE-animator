[Syn]
If I stolled into your town
Would you follow me around
If I, I hung out on your block
Would you telephone a cop

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
If I was new around here and hittin' on your daughter
And took her to the creek and fucked her in the water
Then she brought me home and I put on your robe
Would you be mad enough to let your barrels explode

[Syn]
If I sold your son cocaine
Would you put a bullet in my brain
If I, I stole your favorite cow
Would you cock the hammer back and be like pow, I bet you would

I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me
I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me

[Syn]
Your daughter, she just had sex with me
I fed her some drank and ecstasy
If I, if I don't steal your cow
Would you let me live in your barn

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I don't have a problem with small town folk, nope
I like y'all, as soon as I flip this dope
I'm a open a titty bar next to the school, uh ha
I'm glad we all neighbors, I mean, I think it's cool

[Syn]
If I walked up at your church drunk out my mind
Would you still let me sip up on that red wine
If we, we played your shitty town
Would you help me and pass these flyers round, yeah

I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me
I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me

[Violent J]
Southern love baby, don't doubt it
Don't let my records fool you, I'm about it
I love fat rednecks who fuck they kids
Beat they wife and yet serve no bids
Only judge in town, he also the cop
He also the barber at the hair chop shop
He the mayor, the clerk, and what I'm speakin', shit
He the one fuckin' his kids and wife beatin'
There ain't no law, gonna punish himself
And that's why the carnival's bad for your health
When we get there, we gonna get rid of ya
They gon' find a piece of ya head in Bolivia
I'll lay you out front with your corpse to rest
And a Hatchetman flag stickin' outta your chest
Say hello to the new sherif, Violent J
With one law, let there be Juggalo-ism all day

I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me
I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me

I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me
I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me

I think I like it
Fuck that, I'm staying
Right here, I like it
Hey, I like it
Yeah</pre>
