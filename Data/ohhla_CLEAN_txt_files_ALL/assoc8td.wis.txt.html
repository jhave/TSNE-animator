Song:   Associated
Typed by: Cno Evil

[GZA]
Associated with metal detectors, loud mouth show-off
To stand out like bite reflected
Words to vibrate like the bass guitar
With the least amount of weight, you should replace a bar
You can tempt me, with looseleaf paper that's empty
I write it in a code, for your average DaVinci
From the era of the REC Room and cassette tapes
Putting empty, rhyme on anything except greats
Too tech mix lay pararrel, the place got marks
On the spot, move around like parasail
The sight sailed obscene, testing ground for new theories
Cuz some DJ's formed the team
Torrential down pour, you hear the sound, more
Nature's fury, and this town is bound for
Hip hop, most violent, most beautiful
Wind gusts, from Justice scenes in the musical

[Bronze Nazareth]
The blade runner, face gunner, mace never cold case
Kept a base stretcher, erase your bass set-up
Freestyles wet up, written, hit your kitchen ketchup
Mass grown, hand feets'll shout, whatever the weather
Body white, sheet stretcher, mic aim leary's atcha
Rapture rhyme graphter, smash the camera
Arm &amp; Hammer hand jammers, slam-a-grammer, Ghost standard
Everything you touch turn Bronze, I'm like the old stanza
Handle vine cables, swing 'em like Tarzan
Divine rhyme plant pay you, digits to farlands
Peace to my cousin, who smoking clouds, open house
Prepare once a month in the Source, like the menstrual's out
Guns accumulate, devout, get my pension with the pencil out
Thoughts stench on my potential droughts
Resume the rain, no matter the windchill
I make you think, still Detroit/Killah Hill
Deeply my footprints build for bodies to feel
Raised by the dumpsters, black, the Zombie-ville
Gun Rule burglars, with murderers masks
Known to filter out the snakes that be burning the grass

[Kevlaar 7]
Associated with black steel, in the hour of chaos
Unreal, like niggas in the seance
Some say I, and grab you with the pen
If you murder the king, I live forever in the end
I've been evil, through the eye of a needle
Just when I grab the steel, as black as Don Cheadle
Feeble and weak, I peep Samson niggas
Revolution come, I pull hair and then triggers
Invented the cause, when pause was indented
Face the follow leads, the flame, my mind painted
John Lennon gats, clapping out of my window
Lay low, one shotty, loo the lasso

[Phillie]
I snap shop, pop out like Polaroids
So wild, we still riot like the middle of Detroit
The SWAT, South West A-Team, the block
Do say, when grace hip hop, the Beijing around-the-way cops
Hold me in, like rhyme flicks, phoned in
Still pitched dope, any zip code I'm in
Capture the souls of men, and women alike
Last flow, pin the mic, begin to strike
It ain't no slouchers here, we out this year
Ya'll about that, we about this here
From small cats to the top, in here
Got cares, like we really got a option here
Going all out, GZA on board, now we pedalling
Mainstream, the model still CREAM, that's how we handle shit

[Salute]
Niggas just actors, not really factors
Putting on shows in the street, that bring laughter
What happen to the jabbers, uppercut, scrappers
Confrontation now, bring nothing but gun clappers
Stains on the conrete, blood on the mattress
Mind runs deep like the Nile going backwards
Hip hop dead? Then I'm here to resurrect it
Big Daddy shit, with the "Kane", I'm an expert
"No Half Steppin'", break show amazing
Mad situations, leave the gun blazing
Seeing Vietnam through the eyes of an Asian
Cold hearted lungs, but my tongue spit Cajun</pre>
