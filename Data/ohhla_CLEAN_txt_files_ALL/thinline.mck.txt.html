Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Hook: Buffalo Madonna]
And on on and on and on we go
And on on and on and on we go
We love who we are but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Same city, yeah, we can't break up
Nice mask on, wear the same one
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Was convincing women that they looked
Better in their makeup
I wear war paint, fight to the casket
Too tired to apologize on this mattress
Emotional detachment  what's the matter?
She's learning that she never should have
Dated a rapper
I don't blame her, my mind is gone
I'm at dinner, checking phone calls
Texts &amp; blogs
I don't hear a word, I know nothing at all
Just concerned about the world
Memorizing these songs

Goes on and on
Don't wanna break you
But I'm leading you on
On, on, on, on
And now it's gone

[Hook: Buffalo Madonna]
And on on and on and on we go
And on on and on and on we go
We love who we are but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
This time we know we know
It's over, over

[Bridge: Buffalo Madonna]
Didn't believe in love until we fell out
Gave the keys back, now I'm on the homie's couch
Always going out, sleeping round with strangers
Danger! But you can't live without her
Now you're paranoid, checking on her cellphone
Making sure she ain't like you alone
Haven't made love with the lights still on
It's like you're hiding something from me

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Let's fake another toast to the good life
Predict the future, clean slate, blue sky
Fantasy: I see me husband, you wife
Lyin', staring into those two eyes
And I can't take it, back to where we came from
My pavement, past the emotional earthquake foundation
Yeah, let's keep swimming in the snake pit
Get bit, get out then jump back into the suffocation
Make up and fuck to save us like we got this
Come on, this is just us baby
And this is just a fight, this is just love  maybe
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
I swear to god, I wish that I could Photoshop the scars off
Cold world and get all my heart throbbed
And I said it all and never get lock jaw
Mouth is a sawed off shotgun at any second could pop off
How does the truth taste?
My job comes with complimentary toothpaste
Lately, I've been living up out of my suitcase
Building trust in that I'm leaving on Tuesday
Bought a one night stand, just a bootleg
A duplication of something authentic
Heart augmented, and it's so hard to end it
I said peace before but this time I meant it

[Bridge: Macklemore &amp; Buffalo Madonna]
Can't get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

Can't get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

[Hook: Buffalo Madonna]
And on on and on and on we go
And on on and on and on we go
We love who we are but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
This time we know we know
It's over</pre>
