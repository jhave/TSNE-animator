[Chorus]
What can I do
What can I say
Ohh, how will it feel
How will it be
How will it be
What can I do

Keep it old school like black and white, spit the facts of life
The way I used to do things, how I do it twice
Streets ain't nothing nice, static like all my 45's
Handle static with .45's, hanging out of a '49
With more than enough power to blow your mind
Doesn't matter to me whether yours or mine
It's the neighborhood homes, that's my storyline

[Chorus]

*over chorus*
Ey all I can do is continue to do what I've been doing, you know
And I can only say how I feel, and the way that I see things ey
Ey how would it feel if we could just put all this bullshit aside homes
How would it be

Creased up Dickies and pendletons
Neighborhood wars that nobody ever wins, but it never ends
I don't know why we prove ourselves to be bad
Leave our families sad and it's driving me mad

*talking*
Ey back in the days when I got blasted ey
I saw my jefita cry like I never seen her cry before

I'm where the weed's at, kick back under streetlamps
Light one up give you feedback

[Chorus]

*over chorus*
Ey all I can do is continue to do what I've been doing, you know
And all I can say is how I feel, and the way that I see things
How would it feel if we could put this bullshit aside and wake up
How would it be
I can't even imagine that

I don't have nothing much, I'm just used to what I'm used to
Sometimes choose to do what fools do
Just need my ruca and oldies to cruise to
Don't need no more friends, I don't know who's who
Scandelous vatos ey, come shake up the spot
I work hard for mine, don't come take what I got
I'm a man with pride and homes I gotta live
All I can do is just give what I can give

[Chorus]

*over chorus*
What can I do, just the same thing I've been doing
And all I can say is what I feel and the way that I see things
But how would it feel if we could put this bullshit aside, you know
How would it be
That's some shit
What can I do
It's just me</pre>
