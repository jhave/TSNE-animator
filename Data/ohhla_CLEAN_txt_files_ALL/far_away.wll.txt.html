Song:   Far Away From Home
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
She comes from a small town
She would've stole her mom's car
Crazy baby, she says she gonna make it far uptown
She wanna be a superstar right now

She says she gonna throw a party wild
She wanna be on movie screens
Pretty baby, she made it on that magazine
Tuck down, she ain't the only one
This happens all the time and it goes on and on and on

[Chorus]
Let's go far away from home
Run on a rocket
Come down the boulevard, burning it up
Let's go far away from home
Run on a rocket
Come down the boulevard, burning it up

I wanna run away from home
I don't wanna think about it
Run baby, run, I don't wanna think about it
Run away from home
I don't wanna think about it
Come down the boulevard, burning it up

[Verse 2]
He's a boy from the ghetto
He wanna buy his momma a house
Little baby, he's trying to move her up that town
Got a job, he's selling drugs, but she don't know
Momma's proud
He said he's going to Hollywood
Up on a hill next to the nail
Sister know now, she's mad as hell, but she won't tell
Mama, he ain't the only one, this happens all the time
And it goes on and on and on

[Chorus]
Let's go far away from home
Run on a rocket
Come down the boulevard, burning it up
Let's go far away from home
Run on a rocket
Come down the boulevard, burning it up

I wanna run away from home
I don't wanna think about it
Run baby, run, I don't wanna think about it
Run away from home
I don't wanna think about it
Come down the boulevard, burning it up

[Bridge]
Run on a rocket ship
Run on a rocket ship
Run on a rocket ship
Run on a rocket ship

[Chorus]
Let's go far away from home
Run on a rocket
Come down the boulevard, burning it up
Let's go far away from home
Run on a rocket
Come down the boulevard, burning it up

I wanna run away from home
I don't wanna think about it
Run baby, run, I don't wanna think about it
Run away from home
I don't wanna think about it
Come down the boulevard, burning it up

Let's go far away from home
Run on a rocket
Come down the boulevard, burning it up
Let's go far away from home
Run on a rocket
Come down the boulevard, burning it up

I wanna run away from home
I don't wanna think about it
Run baby, run, I don't wanna think about it
Run away from home
I don't wanna think about it
Come down the boulevard, burning it up</pre>
