Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Broken hearts everywhere?
From stepping on love we don't care?
Somebody tell me what we gonna do?
Even though it's plenty to share?
People hungry in the streets life just ain't fair?
But you never think about it until it's you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm gonna say how I feel ?
And what I wanna say is?love is the only thing that's real?
Now I'm gonna tell you what to do?
Just believe that love is the only thing we have that's true

[Chorus]
Love is the answer?
Love is the answer

Love is the answer to the questions in your mind?
If you looking it's the answer that you'll find

It's the only thing that everybody needs?
It's the only thing that makes us truly free

[Verse 2]
Friends nowhere to be found?
To help you when you are down?
But you know that you're the one to blame?
We know what's wrong from what's right
Nobody wins in a fight?but still we play the game

[Chorus]
Love is the answer?
Love is the answer

Love is the answer to the questions in your mind?
If you looking it's the answer that you'll find

It's the only thing that everybody needs?
It's the only thing that makes us truly free

[Bridge]
Just look around the whole wide world ?
So many beautiful things to see?
Take my hand and come along spread some love with me</pre>
