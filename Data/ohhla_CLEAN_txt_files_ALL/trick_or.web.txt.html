Typed by: AZ Lyrics

'Cause you know I'm spittin' heat every time I hit the beat
'Cause I am a monster every day I trick or treat
'Cause you know I'm spittin' heat every time I hit the beat
'Cause I am a monster every day I trick or treat

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I just run raps trust me, been there done that
I don't make the guns clap, but sharper than a thumbtack
What's that? Homie outta private school rhyming fools
Under the table, since the cradle I've been tryin' to
Kill it with this rhymin' shit
Hit em' with a flyin' fist, one punch take 'em off their feet like a podiatrist
I am sick, you're just a giant vagina, try me bitch
I'll lead you to the lion's den, then tell you what time it is
No one is as fly as this, I just grab the mic n' spit
Fuck dumb rappers I'm a rocket scientist
Flowin' since sixth grade, you know I'm on it now shit
I am a monster, my crib is a haunted house
Rollin' with goblins, ghouls and vampires
Me and Frankenstein lightin' it up like campfires
Puttin in work, I'm a monster till the dirt
Livin' every single day like October 31st

[Chorus]
So trick or treat bitch, trick or treat bitch
All day runnin' up and down your street bitch
So trick or treat bitch, trick or treat bitch
'Cause I'm a monster boy, trick or treat bitch
So trick or treat bitch, trick or treat bitch
All day runnin' up and down your street bitch
So trick or treat bitch, trick or treat bitch
'Cause I'm a monster boy, trick or treat bitch

[Verse 2: Tim Gallo]
I find a bitch and I be in the sack for hours
'Cause I fuck like I got supernatural powers
So if I'm a get the cheeks, they gon' get dick
'Cause I always get treats and I ain't never get tricked
When they put on the beat they say I'm a different guy
Like I dropped Doc Jekyll and switched to Mr. Hyde
Said I'm a monster like the spawn of Satan
Strong arm the leprechaun and get it on with Jason
I'm a ghoulish muthafucka, what I need with a goblin
Trip shrooms on witches' brooms, stash weed in a cauldron
Till I bleed in a coffin precede it with caution
Because you need to get off 'em
And so often, bring taste to mixtapes
Spit fire at Mike Myers, I'm flyer than ring wraiths
So fuck bein' a monster, I'm a Monstar
Trick or treat, I'm the reason you're afraid of the dark

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I'm the white boy wonder, drinking age under
Number one stunner who's as cool as a cucumber
Thunder, lightnin', mythological titan
With fire in his eyes and a bite like Tyson
Bark of a werewolf leave your ass frightened
With mics I ignite the site big as a bison
Anyone'll fight in my squad
Find me on monster.com not lookin' for a job
Put out hits like I was workin' for the mob
With a bottle in my hand and a tendency to rob
Like zombie, watch me I'm a kamikaze
Monster hard body since I learned to use a potty
I'm naughty by nature, darker than Darth Vader
A saber-toothed tiger, bye see ya later
Van Helsing couldn't even fuck with me
I'm a monster with the ink so fuck Disney
