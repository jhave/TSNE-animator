Cuz I'ma smack this muthafucka, back up
Cuz I'ma smack this muthafucka, back up
Cuz I'ma smack this muthafucka, back up
Cuz I'ma smack this muthafucka

See me creepin through the bushes hunch back and barefooted
Got some beer in my system, I barely can bare wit it
When its drama out there; stay smooth, stay smooth
When my click need me, yo I move, yo I move
It ain't funny, see when ya fuckin wit my people
Got the fo fo, buckin it slow I'm so evil
Shit stand up, hold this
See I control this, hemisphere
Makin this clear, and stood focused
Was born broke, so ya ice dont entice me
Eatin chinese food, my juice wasnt icy
I'm still papi, and I ain't change for shit
I been out for four days, I ain't change for shit
Yo saluchi, take ya shit god and rock gucci
Ghetto style no couffi, smoke loosi
Hit the block wit the new uzi
Seven fourty five live gettin new coochie
Hit the hood like the windmill and spin out quick
It wont stop till I cake out shit (oh god)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I got some sons fa you, and some runnas to run fa you
They on the block all day (ay yooo)
She on the block all day (ay yoooo)
We on the block all day (ay yoooo)

I got some Henny in my system the half is startin ta hit me
If I brawl in the club my boys'll brawl wit me
(clears throat), niggas wanna see me foul
Fuckin hatas you should see me now, switch the topic
We was friends but I told shorty (ay yooo)
Dont you get up in this Benz shorty (ay yooo)
And you know i'll fuck ya friends shorty (ay yooo)
And they ain't get no ens shorty (ay yooo)
See niggas, they want my name next to Kurt Cobain
But I dont sniff cocaine, I sniff propane
Keep me gassed up, and I'm keepin my cash up
Shorty give me too much brains, keepin me assed up (ohhhh)
So if you wit it I can hit it and go
And call you from the hood later when I'm huggin a ho
You see, ain't nothin funny man, all about my money man
Dressed up like a rabbit told the bitch that she in bunny land
You see that popper got her feelin herself
Literally god she feelin herself (oh god)

[Chorus]

Back up, cuz I'ma smack this muthafucka
Back up, cuz I'ma smack this muthafucka
Back up, cuz I'ma smack this muthafucka
Back up, cuz I'ma smack this muthafucka
Back up, cuz I'ma smack this muthafucka</pre>
