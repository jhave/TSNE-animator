[Intro]
Hahahah - yeahhhh~!
Nigga if I ain't busy doin somethin nigga
I'm busy thankin of somethin to do
Get some bid'ness 'bout yourself nigga

[Rocko]
I be so busy gettin money ain't got time to talk
Be too busy buyin cars, I ain't got time to walk
Be so busy on the low I ain't got time to eat
Be so busy on the hustle I ain't got time to sleep
I be so busy gettin quickies ain't got time to lay
I be too serious bein busy I ain't got time to play
Be so busy on the grind, still find time to shine
Be so busy fuckin twenties I ain't got time for dimes (NO!)
Not in this lifetime (it's) no way possible
(I'm) too busy breakin down P, liftin blocks and stuff
Running from the cops and stuff, fuckin with them pots and shit
You know, just said that shit, gettin guap' and stuff

[Chorus]
Man I be busy in the trap, I be busy movin packs
I be busy handlin bid'ness I ain't got time for all of that
I be busy gettin stacks, I be busy gettin change
Hoe I can't lay off, true, men ain't got time to be playin games
Man I busier than a muh'fucker, man I be busy on the block
Doing shows getting guap, man you know how shorty rock
Man I be busier than a muh'fucker, man I be busy doin my thang
Ain't nothing changed but my change, you know how we do it mayne

[Rocko]
I got insomnia (f'real?) I can't sleep man
I'm gettin money (what can I say?) I'm a busy man (YEAH!)
Down in Florida (doin what?) Handlin bid'ness man (okay)
I'm like Snow White, you met me down in Disneyland
Fernando (where?) down in Orlando
Que pasa Cheetoh, gimme whatever I can handle
I be busy at all times just weighin them in
One ton, that's two mill' my friend
I counted one point nine, fuck it, weigh it again
Man I be busier than a muh'fucker - say it again
Ay where you at - I'm everywhere (from where) from city to city
I'm gettin money duckin snitches, nigga I'm so busy

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

YEAHH~!</pre>
