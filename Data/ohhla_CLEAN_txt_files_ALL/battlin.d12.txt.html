Ha ha, ha ha, yeah yeah!
Dirty Dozen! Detroit City (Detroit Michigan)
What (What)

[Bugz]
You won't last long like weed in brass bongs
Just another fag blowin some sad bitch-ass songs
I shine sober, cause Bugz is a soldier
Beat that ass like Roy Jones if ya bite I'm pissin(?)cola
Doin the randisco at a disco with a big ho
Bought the stupid bitch from Sisqo now she won't let my dick go
Bugz a stupid nigga, take a shower with my pistol
Walk up in your (?) and pistol ripped you
It's simple, see I'm from the D like Eric Hippo
Sick son of a bitch, robbin a nigga and his kinfolk
Got my gun on my hip, some in the clip, one in the chamber
It's danger, fuckin with this super powered stranger
Fuck a battle - we brought knives, niggaz and guns
Beat yo' ass and run, tryin to catch a case for fun
Bustin at the po'-po' high off weed speed and cocoa (yeah!)
Pumpin Makaveli, heavy handed with my fo'-fo'

[Proof]
Bomb like Saddam, split America in two
Then wrap all around your head like Erykah Badu
My issues, misuse, human anatomy
Tearin your flesh, and you muscle tissues
Knock 'em out his shoes, then check 'em in
And stand firm hold my nuts waitin on yo' second wind
The nine shot (put Denaun out!)
Punch you in your navel and rip your spine out
Talkin bout you run this shit when you ain't got no legs
Plus you all booty like Jennifer Lopez
D-12 (?), work these
Scratch the skin off your back like fur theives
Grab your throat like a nurse squeeze, make the earth freeze
Stick you for a lifetime - like herpes
Challenge Evil Kanivel, (?) jumpin in a Regal
Challenge Officer Riggs, and be in "Lethal"
Challengin fiends to stealin aluminum sidin
Challenge Eminem smokin dope, while hang glidin
Challengin hickville honkies, to a square dance
And climb up Everest blindfolded with my bare hands
Aint no fair chance Dirty Dozen run the D
Anybody want beef then, come to me

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Fuck battlin, we on some gang shit
Duck quick, cause you niggaz might get hit
United we stand, united we fall
I swear to God, Dirty Dozen we gonna kill all y'all

[Bizarre]
10 seconds, kiss yo' ass good riddance
(It's a BOMB!) Told y'all niggaz I wasn't bullshittin
We could fight like a kung-fu flick, choose your weapon
Shake hands, knock yo' ass out in 10 seconds
Bizarre needs a counselor
I done shitted on so many MC's, (?) should be my sponsor
Have Prince rob ya for your "Diamonds and Pearls"
While I'm in the next room, havin my way with your girl
I swear, I kill any MC up in here
My niggaz pop so many guns, you swear it was New Year's
They're gon' need an ambulance when I finish battlin you
Pop shit? My gang's on Runyan Avenue
You niggaz ain't crooks, plus you all shook
Have you mom suck my cock while I read Playboy books
I aint sayin I'm the illest MC
But ask ten outta ten niggaz, and the ten gon' say me

[Chorus] - 1/2

[Kon Artis]
Bitch, what?  Uh-huh, yeah
Yo, shuttup, yeah
(?) walker, ass gripper and shit talker
Got a love for +dyno-mite+ like Jim Walker
Jim Beam, and have you missin like Jim Hoffa
Coughin I'll be splittin your throat for thinkin of talkin
Love beef, that's why half the click don't even walk in
No love for hoes but shit, I fucks 'em often
May as well give 'em the dick, shit on 'em
And when they ask why I ain't called 'em I just tell 'em I'm sick
Same shit I tell every chickenhead that I bone
They don't believe it, but they know I got a fetish for chrome
Pushin cats in wheelchairs down flights of stairs
Startin fights with chairs (somebody died!!) like we care
Invitin bitches to go hikin with me, up a mountain
Throw 'em off and tell their moms
she died from skinnydippin in the fountain
Mr. Porter stay live on wax
While you throw records into crowds just to say you have a hit track

[Kuniva]
I'm the alcoholic bringin catastrophe to others
Make you C-Murder like Master P's little brother
Flatterin punks, shatterin junk, get your cavity lumped
with the force of a rim-shatterin dunk
Now you wanna be "Thuggish Ruggish" so I'ma let a slug hit
And call you Broken Bone, and if you got a crew
I'ma name 'em all after you
Fractured Bone, Neck Bone and Funny Bone
You can't flash when all your money's gone
I'll give you a thirty minute head start, fuck that
I'll even wait 'til it's dark and hunt you down - swing an axe
and watch how many dumb thoughts leak out when your head parts
Fuck yo' automobile to me it's just a red car
Runyan Ave. gon' run yo' ass clean out of existance
In an instant, I'll fire persistant, shots consistant
Terrorist terrorizin your block
See all these niggaz when I step in the club, I'm bringin them
And any nigga lookin too hard, we Rodney King'n 'em
Malice Greene'n 'em, and gasoline'n them with premium
Light a cigarette flick at him and spit it at him
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him
Boxin without gloves, deeper then glee clubs
While you stand in tha back and look mean like E-Luv
Can't no other crew stand us
Put my hands on you quicker than a nigga playin two hand touch
Yo Kuniva in the ruggedest, hop in the truck and hit
everybody on your block, jump out and cut a bitch
Another fuck I gotta put a stain on
In the middle of the street screamin bring the pain on

[Chorus]</pre>
