[Da Brat]
Welcome to the wonderful world of Destiny's Child
I'm Da Brat-tat-tat, my homeboy Den on the track
and we gon' lay you flat on yo' back
when the beat-boom-boom-pat-pat like that, y'heard me?
We comin in this game like some survivor's
and we leavin this game like some survivor's
So from now, until we dead and gone
we gon' BE, some survivors, y'heard me?
Beyoncé, where you at?  Uhh!

[Beyoncé]
Now that you're outta my life, I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without ya, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without ya, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without ya, I love harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without ya, now I'm wiser!
You thought that I'd be helpless without ya but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without ya, but I'm chillin
You thought I wouldn't sell without ya, sold nine million

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
I'ma survivor (WHAT), I'm not gon' give up (WHAT)
I'm not gon' stop (WHAT), I'm gon' work harder (WHAT)
I'ma survivor (WHAT), I'm gonna make it (WHAT)
I will survive (WHAT), keep on survivin (WHAT)

[Chorus]

[Beyoncé]
You thought I couldn't breathe without ya, I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without ya, perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without ya, but I'm lastin
You thought that I would die without ya, but I'm livin
Thought that I would fail without ya, but I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now, but it won't stop
Though that I would self-destruct, but I'm still here
Even in my years to come, I'm still gon' be here!

[Chorus] - 2X

[Kelly]
Wishin you the best, pray that you are blessed
Much success, no stress, and lots of happiness
I'm better than that!  I'm not gon' blast you on the radio
I'm better than that!  I'm not gon' lie to you and your family
I'm better than that!  I'm not gon' hate on you in the magazines
I'm better than that!  I'm not gon' compromise my Christianity
I'm better than that!  You know I'm not gon' diss you on the internet
cause my momma tought me better than that!

[Chorus] - 2X

[Da Brat over end of Chorus]
Uhh, c'mon, uhh
Now that I been through the storm and the rain
Climbed up the ruff side and got tough at times
but I remain, if I got the stuff to shine
and without the pump, protect mine
Survive in the game, hate on me cause you lame
They don't ever see your face or say your name
No more pain for me, no more misery, cause you history
I'ma hold on to what I got
Strap on to my perfection, strap on protection
My own direction, born to be the best at what I do
I'ma make it through, stompin like a soldier in my big black boots
I keep 'em "Jumpin, Jumpin," stayin funky, funky for you
No matter who's that man that walk out of your life
You don't need 'em, don't be no heater
Long as I'm still breathin, not leavin for no reason
See them come and go, one switch, they not gold
No house no mo', not even a condo
As long as I know how to love, I'ma stay alive
No need your game or style
They can't tame me cause I'm wild, not ashamed of stayin down
Can the rain sit, and 'em things chromed out, spit
and in my game, no doubt, I'ma get paid in a big way, survivor!

[Chorus] - 4X</pre>
