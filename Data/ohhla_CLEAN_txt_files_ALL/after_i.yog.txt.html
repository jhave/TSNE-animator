[Chorus]
After I fuck your bitch
Then I'mma tell you bout it
If you a trick ass nigga
You'll be fuck up about it
I hope you don't start
No fuckin' beef about it
Or I'll take her name and yo name
And make a rap about it

[Verse 1]
Now all y'all niggas know pimpin' ain't dead
And these hoes followin' us like simon said
I only trust me myself and I, you ask me why
Cause the first time I seen a man cry
Was because a bitch
She broke his heart
She left him for dead
Though my h boom coon
Gast up the bitch head
Every nigga don't love you
He just tryin' to rich
And here the bitch fail for the shit(so hear this)
These niggas got a couple birds
You know how that go
We snatch a rumor that we heard
We finna vamp out
We rush in and ran in the door
In the ?????
The bitch start screamin'
I padded her on the ass
Job well done
We got what we wanted, it's to roll
I'm sittin' on a brick and half, nothin' but old
These niggas lookin stupid it's hard to swallow
Imagine a bitch taking every dollar you done earn

[Chorus]
After I fuck your bitch
Then Imma tell you bout it
If you a trick ass nigga
You'll be fuck up about it
I hope you don't start
No fuckin' beef about it
Or I take her name and yo name
And make a rap about it

[Verse 2]
Now you the hardest nigga in the hood
You talkin shit
But you weak than a motherfucker
We it comes to that bitch
You better watch before I knock her
And get cha hot
You suppose to be my nigga
But you huggin' your glock
You wanna kill me, you wanna steal me
Over a bitch, you wanna hurt me
You wanna curse me, put me on disc
You dislike, you fight me, you wanna strike me
Wanna catch me, and wear me like an old pair of nikes
It ain't over, I saw your hoe, ridin' in your rover
I was sober, I pulled her over, now I done stole her
My nigga better watch your bitch, cause she been creepin'
My nigga me and your bitch, we been like sleepin'
She been talkin'  about your stash and I been hurtin'
I gotta tech-nine in the mat I'm about to serve ya
Run up on ya, and pull it on ya, and put it through ya
Just to let you know what your hoe will do to ya

[Chorus]
After I fuck your bitch
Then Imma tell you bout it
If you a trick ass nigga
You'll be fuck up about it
I hope you don't start
No fuckin' beef about it
Or I'll take her name and yo name
And make a rap about it

[Verse 3]
You better watch your bitch, like you watch your mail
If you ain't train that bitch then you goin' to jail
Or gone be dead gone ????? but runs they mouth
Love to fantasize about they man cars and house
You can give the bitch the world
She still gone gice up that car
But you a nobody nigga that sellin' rocks on the block
You better watch your bitch cause I'm shinin' like diamonds
You bring her around me it's gone be a matter of time
For I fuck your bitch and let you know about it
If you a trick ass nigga you'll be fuck up about it
I hope you don't throw no fuckin' fit about it
That's life and you really can't do shit about it
You wanna hi-side dick ride cause you think I'm on
You comin to me wrong tryin' to popcorn, bitch gone
For I catch a fuckin aggrivated, see you then violated
You told them folk that I was drug related
I gotta grudge with the judge she ??????
Domestic violence three years without parole
Watch your bitch, and stop your bitch, before your bitch
Get your ass in a world of shit

[Chorus]
After I fuck your bitch
Then Imma tell you bout it
If you a trick ass nigga
You'll be fuck up about it
I hope you don't start
No fuckin' beef about it
Or I'll tale her name your name
And make a rap about it
