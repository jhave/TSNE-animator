[Intro: Ghostface]
Aiyyo, where the fuck is that blunt at?
Where y'all niggaz hoggin the shit man?
Two pulls of that shit nigga start gettin paranoid and shh
Get your fuckin, get your feet off my fuckin table nigga!
Fuck you think you at home, with your cheap fur on?
Shit look like it 'bout to bite somethin and shit nigga

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, it was the night before he got popped
Big jars of haze, Cheech &amp; Chong bong in the spot
Tropicana, strawberries, diced bananas
The long dookie fifth, next to the Town House crackers
Mad noise, 2008, a G a game
I'm Ron O'Neal in the love seat, sunk deep
Long niggaz bustin out they punk heat
I make a massacre, try to rob one of my donkeys
But I ain't wettin that
I don't wanna send nobody back, violate me, take a nap
Promise you, got somethin Lord that'll honor you
Blow your little head off while you're tyin your shoe
But back in the kitchen, Pyrex's
Occupied by the twins, bank robbers with large records
Hard vest-es, '86 got guards on
Benatar ruggies and frames and fake guns when they robbed Sha Born
To them that's natural, actual
Play the squid-ad, we gettin at you
And we don't wanna rap to you, it's not kosher
It's not a code in la costa nostra to roast ya
I get a lil' closer
Rock you to sleep, like I got these lil' bitches, come over!
Hopin you fall for the bait, thinkin you safe
Have that ass sweatin like T.D. Jakes
I want the ones nigga, you non-believers you can ask your momma
... Now that's drama

[Joell Ortiz]
Uhh, dollar icey from, papi with the scraper, glock with the laser
Tryin my best not to pop yet but the drop is major
Shot my lil' cuz, I do my aunt a favor, watch this
I never been this itchy, hope these cops just
get a doughnut urge and just splurge, you got the nerve to play third?
In a softball tournament round my way, say that's ya word
You bird, I'll put your beak on the curb but anyway
Looks like a good game, the pigs ain't leavin so I'ma lay
Nice play, just too bad it's your last
Couple bundles of D, and 200 cash that sat you in the grass
I watch the teams line up, shake hands, guess the game's over
Faggot nigga hopped in the Liberty, fake Range Rover
I'm on his +Tail+ like, Sonic lil' shorty
Palmin on a 40, broad day I'm tryin to dodge a cover story
Look like he stoppin for gas, I'ma pluck 'em, yay
This had to be his most, unlucky lucky day
Two brothers come out 7/11 in Army wear and stand there
I'm actin like my tires need air
He close the gas cap, too many things goin his way
So I just stashed that, y'all probably think I'm buggin but hey
I know them games in Lindsay Park is every Sunday, he ain't goin nowhere
I went home, switch gear, went out and grabbed me a beer
Ten drinks later I'm at Burger King window for a Whopper
Look left and see partner, I hit the stash BLAKA!
... Now that's drama

[The Game]
Who the fuck you think you is, Ron O'Neal?
Tat-tat, what the fuck when that 9-milli peel
(Is it real?) Realer than Pittsburg +Steel+
Yo Ghost pass the toast, these niggaz is daffodils
Got butt-naked bitches countin half a mil', gloves on
Fully dressed bitches watchin them, with they snubs on
While I'm in the kitchen pretendin to be Raekwon
Watchin Rachael Ray all day, I get my cake on
Fiends love me like a Drake song
Rep that Lou' Vuitton Bottom in my back pocket all day long
Black Wall Mafia, Wu-Tang Sopranos
Niggaz say they pushin ki's/keys but we don't see pianos
Niggaz say they pushin Phantoms, we don't see the +Opera+
Niggaz steady rockin dreads, you ain't even rasta
Take your New Era off, and reveal
the faggot nigga you are or your +cap+ gettin peeled
Then we out to Brazil, I know niggaz in Negril
that'll chop your fuckin head off, and throw it on the grill
Take the gold out your mouth and throw it in they grill
Send a finger to your moms and let her know that it's real
Nigga we in the field like Chris Johnson
It's 2010, how the fuck we get six Thompsons?
Top 10, how the fuck you gon' forget Compton?
Every rapper on your list'll get they shit stomped in
I started Su-Wu, I'm the reason for that 5 shit
Came in the game, on that fuckin "Ready to Die" shit
Sold 9 mil', ended up on some fly shit
Naked pictures, R&amp;B bitches all in my Sidekick
How I be killin the pussy, should be a hate crime
Got a Blackberry, was gettin too much face time
Back to fuckin project bitches, now I hate dimes
All they want is money my nigga, I can't waste mine
I son/sun niggaz like it's daytime
Gray cotton Louis sweatsuit, with the Ralph Lauren waistline
Smooth as a baby's ass, and I got that Baby cash
Catch me in the hood, same deals Old Navy had
Motherfuckers</pre>
