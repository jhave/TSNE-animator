[Talking]
Gangsta? (haha!, what?)
Mikkey Finest (fa sho')
Ah King Pin's Dream
Mack 10, Inglewood
I'm nigga Mikkey
Chi-Town, Birdman [*Laughs*]
Listen, Whatcha got nigga?...

[Mikkey]
I got a trouble find bitches in the kitchen and they cooking it row
Realisting feams like stitches with the hooker in they chow
Fuck the law, man - I'm known for cooking it row
Til the cops just chill - I got something for y'all
I got a Bentley and the Hummer and they sittin on 'em daters
I got a hot power lawyer with the million retater
Douth-South, Westside - man, I own my city
Got judges on my pay roll like they own the nigga
It's a professional with my game, I ball with the best
Birdman, Down-South - Mack 10 out West
Fuck with my money, put to put the mack to yo' chest
Want war? I take it there - or rather tattooed to there
See them Cash Money niggas - how can I iced like 'em
Cooking coke from the pill-up, it's got a prices like 'em
You know a nigga Whoopise - I got a wife like him
You heard a Micheal Jordan right! - I got a life like him
I'ma mothafuckin hustla - y'all know the game
Chi-Town Mikkey Flow - y'all know my name
Game is risky but a nigga rather died the fame
and live life - broken hungry out here, cracking for bread

[Mikkey (Chorus)] 2x
It's a King Pin's Dream - coke and feminines
Belley's on triple beams, got scuffles with triple feams
So, busting out the scene - guns, scopes and beems
But the thing about it dream - it ain't all watta seem

[Mack 10]
(yo, yo, yo)
When it comes to drugs - these reppers ain't get none but fo'
Ohhh square ass nigga and full of brains are sold
I Know 'em Feds is on heat but I don't give a fuck
I'm so deep in the game it's like my name is stuck
From crack, more then likey is a suggestion of sell
I gives a fuck - who ya breaking and disso skell
I live life like a King Pin weed but raw
I'm the richest gang living them niggas ever saw
I with ya belly from Toyota with the biggest and baking soda
Pirates po's full of peppers and crack folders
I'ma dope dealer - and I got coke scrilla
My whole crew can sit to at x-cons and killas
and my bitches is falls who bomb, head and coochie
Rockin props, the fades - the letto pump boochie
First statis, rock rolo - when I came to the door?
and now it's Bentleys, Mansions and meats to the floor
Kickin gears on Parley's, while the straight pipe screen
and I had a block on lock - since I was fifteen
Mack Sapranos - the most of unforgiven
and fuck a job, cause dope money is how I'm living

[Mikkey (Chorus)] 2x
It's a King Pin's Dream - coke and feminines
Belley's on triple beams, got scuffles with triple feams
So, busting out the scene - guns, scopes and beems
But the thing about it dream - it ain't all watta seem

[Baby]
(Fa sho', fucked up, look)
My homey got marries - so, you know we aint slipping
Two hoes, two Bentleys - you know we ain't dipping
Lifestyle, drug dealing - you know we ain't trippin
Got killas on the row - you know we ain't slipping
Tote trucks full of bricks - you know we ain't chickens
New cars, pretty broads - you know we been pimpin
Bitch stars, body bars - we hitting and missing
Big cars, superstars - cause wheels gon' spinning
Pretty honeys, bug stunt - cause the money we spending
Planty bitchs and warehouse - tinning piece for chicken
Riot guns shoot 'em up - for this life that I'm living
PO partners doin time - cause my homeboy miss me
The Feds, big trippin - cause they failed me to get me
Mack 10 re-shout - til ya homey my nigga
King Pin, Big Tymin - drug dealing my nigga
Transport and cocaine - and statelines my nigga

[Mikkey (Chorus)] 2x
It's a King Pin's Dream - coke and feminines
Belley's on triple beams, got scuffles with triple feams
So, busting out the scene - guns, scopes and beems
But the thing about it dream - it ain't all watta seem

[over chorus talking]
Hmm, hmm, hmm...uh-huh, uh-huh, fa sho' nigga

Uh-uh, uh-uh, fa sho', look here
