Intro: Sadat X

Ha, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, straight from the wilds of The Bronx, it's Buckwild, y'knowI'msayin?
And that kid Sadat X born king, doin my thing
KnowI'msayin? I let'cha know how it is in my lifestyle everyday

Verse One: Sadat X

Lately yo, I been walkin tightropes
It's an adventure everyday as I walk down the block
Quiet baldhead is like a bad motherfucker
All charged up from Madison Ave.
I'm up on the stage if you read the front page
Give me the ol' school mic wiv a cord
I'll stand on the table, give a fuck about a label
Now, we all can't brawl, we all can't brawl
It'll be your downfall when you're goin like this
Is it the cash or the hash from my stash that compells you?
Gas kids throw me but my crew bring me back
They stay on my back so I don't act like alladat

Hook: Busta Rhymes

Now all these niggas carry on like they think they alladat
They think they alladat, they think they alladat
Now all these niggas carry on when they think they alladat
They think they alladat, they think they alladat

Verse Two: Sadat X

Late one night, 55th outpost
Chickenhead watchin to see who she can catch
She got a man, I can tell cos the action in her eyes
ain't nervous, a young sassy thing
She call me a playa, standin on the corner wiv her whole dime crew
I'm ridin down the block wiv her girlfriend
In the next nigga's car, lookin like a star
Shades, blackness, packed his whole damn frame
Ya got to be down to *?starts?* about the booty
Cos Sonny Lamb packs the wham
It's all good, yeah it's all good
See it attracts kids that are sweater
A nigga like me'll be the first to forgetta
So now she all mad, bringin drama to the crib
Go ahead, chickenhead, wit the funk
You get played like trash if you act like you'd always have and you always
will
Chickenheads is only good for a thrill

Hook: Busta Rhymes

Yo yo, yo they think they alladat, they think they alladat
All these bitches carry on when they think they alladat
They think they alladat, they think they alladat

Verse Three: Sadat X

Now my cheques jam and I waited all damn week
And if I flip em the bad guy, you wonder why
When the corner officers and nobody can call me back
and everybody claims to know nothin
And these is the peoples that's down wit me
supposedly, lays on my side, yeah right
They let a nigga die in the night if you let em
You can get wild, flip, go grab the mask
But it damn sure slow-up the cash cos I know
ya be a menace to society, still waitin for the dough
The thinkin man is the one with the plan
Plant his seeds first then be ready to burst
It's like that, huh? My name is X from the hot blocks of Harlem
Take it personally when you try to stop my stardom
Use to be mild, find myself gettin wild
Got to slow down for my girl and my child
Cos I love life and I gots ta live it
and everytime I get on stage I'ma move sometin
And you can never say the X didn't hit'cha
Aiyo, I put it on ya, but first I warn ya
This ain't no average skit, this is a hit
More than you hit, better than your best shit
better than your man's shit, better than his cousin's shit
better than your whole block, buck once and then ya come wit that nons....

Interlude: Sadat X talking

Aight, hey Buck, when you bring what you bring to the game and when I bring
what I bring to the game, it's dangerous that I can't even call it. But we
gonna end it off like this, y'knowI'msayin? On some Bronx town shit, check
it out

Verse Four: Sadat X

The big X has spoken, courtesy of Buck
A Bronx hoe-down similar to the showdown
Won't you place a bet on ya man
You know my style and you know where I stand 
I'ma leave you on wit the real for right now
Peace to Brand Nubian, Now Rule and Buckwild
But right now, peep the master of the headnod
Hit New York harder and smarter, thieves attack, now stay back
Tainted styles don't pass the grade
A lotta kids are slidin, just ridin on the wave
A lotta kids are slidin, just ridin on the wave
A lotta kids are slidin, just ridin on the wave

Hook: Busta Rhymes

Yo, all these niggas think they hard when they think they alladat
They think they alladat, they think they alladat
All these bitches act like sluts when they think they alladat
They think they alladat, they think they alladat
Now all these fraud niggas are bitches when they think they alladat
They think they alladat, they think they alladat
Fuck dem niggas out there who think they alladat
They think they alladat, they thunk they alladat

Fuck dem niggas, fuck dem bitches
Fuck dem fraud ass, motherfuckers
Fake ass niggas
HAH!
