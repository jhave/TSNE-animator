[Hook]
It must be somethin' in the water they drink
It's been the same with every girl I had
It must be somethin' in the water they drink
Why else would a woman wanna treat a man so bad

[Verse 1]
She was everything I needed
Atleast that's what god's contract between us stated
After 25 years of my experience of her lack of maternal instincts
I found I've defeated all odds to make it
Without a mama's love now I feel out of place
Extra wounds for a man who's never seen his father's face
As mama freebased the money for my high school tuition
From my stepfather's home I would always catch an eviction
Or a swift punch to the face
Bleeding rivers of red, fled to any quiet place
I couldn't believe that she said
He meant more to her than I did, just goodbye kid
I hope you die kid is what I viewed through my busted eyelids
I slit my wrist and sit and watch the droplets run on the floor
My cousin kicked in the door, nigga I was at war
With who was supposed to be my life bringer
The all knower, my nourisher, my aspiration encourager
I figured the fault's due to how my uncle assaulted you
And grandma died still believing it wasn't true
But I'm your only child, how can you turn your back on me
I cannot accept your apology
I'm sorry you dead to me mommy

[Hook]
It must be somethin' in the water they drink
It's been the same with every girl I had
It must be somethin' in the water they drink
Why else would a woman wanna treat a man so bad
(Treat a man so bad so bad so bad.
 You need someone to love you) It must be in the water

[Verse 2]
Why you making me leaving you much more feasable than staying
I gave you everything, please be reasonable
You're my queen by which all other women will be judged
I wanted to die so much with nobody to trust
Deep down, I felt that she was just another liar
Now I wouldn't spit on her if she was on fire
Presice way to describe it, damn I shoulda been out
Our relationship a hand grenade, you just pulled the pin out
No doubt, my world was on the rocks
My life a car crash on the side of the road, y'all slowin down to watch
I'ma leave silently tonight, you'll never find me
I guess i'm tired of seeing my best friend's car parked in my driveway bitch

[Hook]
It must be somethin' in the water they drink
It's been the same with every girl I had
It must be somethin' in the water they drink
Why else would a woman wanna treat a man so bad
It must be somethin' in the water they drink
It must be somethin' in the water they drink
Yeah, it's in the water

[Verse 3]
I met you 8 years ago
Your smile captivated my soul which was miserable
I fell in love with you instantly
I knew I wanted to protect you from this world
You were related to my girl
And even after only one year of your life
Your intelligence and love for me shined so bright
I was only 17 but it didn't take me long
To realize that I wanted to raise you as my own
And although biologically there is no tie that binds
There is no blood test that could tell me you ain't mines
And its never been kept a secret for who your real father is
But that motherfucker don't know what your favorite color is
And he don't know in school what your favorite subject is
And when you have bad dreams at night you call my name not holler his
And sometimes I wonder if you found me or I found you
And I would never say a bad word about that man around you
The older you get, the closer we get, It's harder for me
I hate the way your mom's family gives us family priority
Or authority when he told child support "Look she ain't mines"
Where was they when he was giving your moms black eyes
But the fact lies and now whatever
Our last name's the same
And you and your sister's future is filled with anything you dream
But I gotta realistically look upon tomorrow
To the first time you get upset at me and say "You ain't my father"

[Hook]
It must be somethin' in the water they drink
It's been the same with every girl I had
It must be somethin' in the water they drink
Why else would a woman wanna treat a man so bad
(Treat a man so bad so bad so bad.
 You need someone to love you) It must be in the water</pre>
