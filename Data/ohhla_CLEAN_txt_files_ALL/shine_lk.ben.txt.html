[Benzino]
Yo (oh oh oooh)
Benzino (be so strong)
My lil' 7 year old son (uh-huh)
(Ooooooh) Rayshaun, uhh
This ones for you (be so strong)

[Chorus: Case]
If ever your travels get lonely
Your troubled and feel all alone
Remember virtues I share with you
And let your life shine like the son

[Benzino over Chorus]
And this is also goin out
to all the dawgs locked down everywhere
Who don't get a chance (yeah)
to kick it with they son
This is for y'all too, come on

[Benzino]
I've watched you grow before you walked, since day one
(You the greatest dad!) and youse the greatest son
The day will come when you'll have kids and raise them
(Come on slow down dad, I'm tryna stay young)
Well aight, I'ma teach ya how to play and win (huh)
Follow ya first thoughts and never think again (aight)
We Made Men from the womb, and you're a jewel (alright)
Now I don't want you to see the things I been through (ha)
We got haters in life, they'll try an play you (okay)
Never get emotional, think, remain cool (alright)
Follow rules -  you'll have it all, the plane too (aight)
Last of all (huh) don't let money change you (yeah)

[Chorus: Case]
If ever your travels get lonely
      [and if ya don't know, now ya know]
Your troubled and feel all alone
Remember virtues I share with you
      [come on come on, you too dad]
And let your life shine like the son

[Benzino]
I'ma give you answers to ya questions, yup
Like why it's important when havin sex to use protection
You a blessin, and I'll always guide you
Not just Iverson, I'm ya role model
There's more to life than money; morals and values
And there's rules in life it's important you follow
Like; never borrow - touch what ain't yours, unless you got to
And help mom with the chores, be responsible
Never follow, believe -- just watch the things ya father do
When they see you, they see me
Can you spit like ya dad?

[Ray Ray]
Yeah it's easy - A-B-C, 1-2-3
Son of a G, from the B
Turn the beat up, time to heat up
Microphones like food I eat 'em
Time for dinner, I'm a winner
Y'all can't stop me, y'all beginners

[Chorus: Case]
If ever your travels get lonely
      [and if ya don't know, now ya know]
Your troubled and feel all alone
Remember virtues I share with you
And let your life shine like the sun

[Benzino]
Sometimes moms gets mad, it's not funny, don't laugh
When you're right okay, when you're wrong that's yo' ass
Not cause I want to, son understand
Moms could teach you everything, but how to be a man
Youse a champ, I'm the champion
(I'm a prince) but I'm the king on the throne

[Ray Ray]
Let it be known, we gon' shine (uh-huh)
Check this watch, man ya know the time (aight)
Time to get mine, oh you didn't know? (what)
Sit back, check the father/son flow
(Come on Ray Ray, tell 'em)
And if ya don't know, now ya know

[Chorus: Case w/ adlibs] - 2X

[Benzino over chorus + (Ray Ray)]
The first, father/son flow...
Shout out.. to all the brothers who ain't here
Shout out to they're sons too (be so stroooong)
Shout out to all the mothers too
Shout out to all the grandfathers (be so stroooong)
We gotta keep it all together
Get this family thing back on, back on track
Big Ray... Benzino...
Ray Ray... yo be so strong...</pre>
