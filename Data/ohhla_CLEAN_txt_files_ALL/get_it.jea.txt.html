Ain't nothin changed
It's still not a game
Jean Grae

Come on

[ VERSE 1 ]
This ain't a gangsta joint, far from it
This is for niggas in the club who only nod they head when shit is rugged
And all the chicks who act crazy love it
Them chicks who stay blunted
Drunk in the middle of the dancefloor like, "Fuck it!"
For those who ain't get in because the door fronted
Park your ride in front of the spot and turn it up, pump it
For niggas caught at checkpoints, got heavy firearms
Fly and Henny'ed up, drivin like they wearin blindfolds
For New York, for Philly, road trips to Atlantic City in rented cars
One month unlimited MetroCards
For straphangers, for niggas who pay for shit with five fingers
My credit card scammers, my hookie party jammers
Exotic exquisite women friends, niggas in denim
Niggas who make hot beats and my dogs who spit venom
My thugs and gentlemen, from vanilla to cinnamon
The first thousand women ( ? ) from N'Sync to Eminem

[ CHORUS ]
Don't stop, I said you won't stop
And if you with me, then we ride until the beat drop
Who got the Henny, yo? Sip it, sip it
Hydro, hit it, hit it
And all my hungry niggas, please yo, don't stop, get it, get it
Don't stop, I said you won't stop
And if you with me, then we drink until last shot
Who got the hydro? Hit it, hit it
Who got the Henny, yo? Sip it, sip it
All my hungry niggas, please yo, don't stop, get it, get it

[ VERSE 2 ]
A new representative, presentin Jean Grae
Customer, client, president, fuck Gen X, we today, nigga
It's hostile today, hot loans and baby mamas to pay
Hot rocks for dollars to sway
What's your hustle, I'm doin mine
And if it don't work - fuck that, it got to
The rhymes too hot to experience how not to
I'm toxic like vodka and gin
200 proof on the rocks, I do it cause I can
Simple, you should stop and I told you who I do it for
And I'm not goin anywhere cause me and life is married and I ain't gettin divorced
So where my hungry women at, my niggas ready to set it
We can all eat, what you need, let's go get it

[ CHORUS ]</pre>
