[Intro]
It's the bad guys
Say hello to the bad guys!
Big Cat Records, Gucci, Black Magic

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We the bad guys, and we play for the bad team
We hauntin ya life like you just had a bad dream
The bad guys...
Just don't get on our bad side

[Gucci Mane]
I fucks with the AR, I fucks with the AK
You fuckin with Gucci, you gon' have a bad day
They say I'm a mad guy, they call me the bad guy
I tell ya like this just don't get on my bad side
I come with that skreet shit, in love with this beef shit
My diamonds ocean blue so they might get ya seasick
I fuck with the Glock 40, {?} shotty
Plus when I aim then I aim for the upper body
Ain't with that hoe shit, I'm smokin that 'dro shit
You come with some mo' shit, you gon' get your throat slit
Yeah this is that G shit, we call it a classic
I have my nigga Magic put that ass in a casket
And that there is real talk, you best have a fast walk
Or else yo' bitch ass might get lined in the white chalk
Fuck what you thank nigga, fuck what you thought nigga
Wired for jaw, so yo' ass can't talk nigga

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Is you a man nigga? Is you a mouse nigga?
Have yo' bitch ass scared to come out the house nigga
Gucci fear no man, so who is this Snowman?
The word on the low is he really a hoe man
Bitch stick to that trap shit, and stick to that rap shit
You say you a gangster, but you never clapped shit
If you wanna find me, take I-20 Flat Shoals
Let's see if you can take this broomstick up your asshole
Always gon' stand ground, never gon' back down
I'm puttin my mack down, I'm layin the smack down
See Gucci's a skreet nigga, I stay on that skreet shit
And I'm the wrong nigga that ya clique wanna beef with
I keep the 9 close like the bitch that you sleep with
And I'll bust a head but can you keep a secret?
I'm smokin that kushie, you niggaz is pussy
I never been a killer but you pussies done pushed me

[Chorus]

[Black Magic]
Now this the bad guy song, they put the bad guys on it
So listen when you hear the two bad guys talkin
I shoot straight, move weight, always in a new state
Always givin fake names, cars got paper plates
The bad guy, say hello to my little friend (say hello)
My lil' friend got a hundred other lil' friends
Now we the bad team, it's more than a bad dream
Gucci and Black Magic now that's a bad scene
Carbon 15's comin out, AK's comin out
I'ma run the North, Gucci run the South
Independent but we ballin like majors
Them fruity ones got 'em all flavors
I'm fuckin with real niggaz and players, killers and cutthroats
And when I get a order homey somebody gettin smoked
I'm no joke, catch the kid cookin up coke
I got a blunt full of bubba kush, nigga come smoke with us

[Chorus]</pre>
