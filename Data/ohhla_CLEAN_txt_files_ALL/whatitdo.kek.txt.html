[Intro]
Rep your hood, (do what)
Rep your hood (do what), rep your hood
For my G's and my thugs, my niggaz rep your hood (do what)
Rep your hood (do what), rep your hood
For my G's and my thugs, my niggaz rep your hood (do what)
Rep your hood (do what), rep your hood (do what)
If you independent women and living, rep your hood (do what)
Rep your hood (do what), rep your hood

[Lil' Keke]
I bet ya y'all came here, to rock the club
It ain't no way, that these haters can stop the club
I see some independent women, I see some thugs
So get your bounce on whodie, and show some love
This the club homie, you take it home if you're tired
The beat shaking the wall, this party is getting live
This the club homie, you take it home if you're tired
She shaking and acting bad, that ass is getting wide
Cause uh we came here, to crank it up
Be a star hit the bar, and drink it up
Now tell em we came here, to crank it up
And ya know that this click, don't give a fuck
So get your roll on homie, and rock the club
We in the VIP, we stank it up
So get your roll on homie, and rock the club
S.U.C. in the building, show us love

[Hook]
So get your back up off the wall, do what ya do
Get your pimp game on for real, now what it do
Already down here fa sho, do what ya do
These shorties they looking good my man, now what it do
What it do, I'm dropping this game up on your brain
What it do, she shaking that ass and letting it hang
What it do, I'm smoking and drinking and feeling good
Sets up in the sky, we repping it for the hood what it do

[Big Pokey]
I picked the lock, and came through
S.U.C.-M.O.B., the same crew
Five pound VS1's, done came blue
In my ear lobes fist, wrists and chain too
Dog I know a hundred thangs, that a dame do
Let her do what she do daddy, just don't let her change you
In the club VIP, pulling the Range through
Tipping hundreds dropping money, some niggaz can't do
What it do, we fall in the club it's going down
VIP broked off, nigga we blowing pine
What it do, S.U.C. we in the place
2005 Take Over, come get a taste
These niggaz, better pick up the pace
Don't kiss her in the morning, cause tonight I'm fins to dick up her face
Now what it do, the club is packed these hoes fine
So who is you, see me I'm a mack these hoes mine

[Hook]

[H.A.W.K.]
What it do, baby
This for Fat Pat, and DJ Screw baby
Won't you scream, till your face turn blue baby
Meet me in front of the club at two baby, what it do baby
H2 baby, got you clinging to a nigga like glue baby
You done bit off more, than you can chew baby
And the rim size, is 22 baby
So what it do, baby
What it do, homie
See you tipping in your slab, and your rims chromey
And you mad, cause your girlfriend all on me
Don't act no fool I got my heat on me, so what it do homie
See, I came here to crank it up
And the weed that I smoke, gon stank it up
And I'm buying out the bar, so drank it up
What it do motherfuckers, let's crank it up
