Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Miss Mary Jane got me feeling like, uuuuuhhhhhuuuu
Miss Mary Jane got me feeling like, uuuuuhhhhhuuuu
Roll her up, roll her up, everybody roll her up
Let her ride her own deck, let her essence fill you up, uuuuhuuuu
Miss Mary Jane got me feeling like, uh

What I'd do without you?
All a nigga, all a nigga do is think about you
Roll you up in a paper, dress her in a swisher
One hit of your love, what a feeling for a nigga
Pass her all around, let the homies touch her
Light it, it burns slow like a motherfucker
And everywhere I go, she come too
Except the airport, I can't get her through

Miss Mary Jane got me feeling like, uuuuuhhhhhuuuu
Miss Mary Jane got me feeling like, uuuuuhhhhhuuuu
Roll her up, roll her up, everybody roll her up
Let her ride her own deck, let her essence fill you up, uuuuhuuuu
Miss Mary Jane got me feeling like, uh

One time for Bob Marley, put your lighters in the air
Be going crazy when she not around
I always want her here
And I be taking my time when I'm breaking you down
Slightly elevated like I'm sitting in the clouds
I ain't coming down, no time soon
And my favorite part is when I'm licking on you
Nobody do me like you do.Damn miss OG, keep your light coming through, aw

Miss Mary Jane got me feeling like, uuuuuhhhhhuuuu
Miss Mary Jane got me feeling like, uuuuuhhhhhuuuu
Roll her up, roll her up, everybody roll her up
Let her ride her own deck, let her essence fill you up, uuuuhuuuu
Miss Mary Jane got me feeling like, uh
Miss Mary Jane got me feeling like, uuuuuhhhhhuuuu
Miss Mary Jane got me feeling like, uuuuuhhhhhuuuu
Roll her up, roll her up, everybody roll her up
Let her ride her own deck, let her essence fill you up, uuuuhuuuu
Miss Mary Jane got me feeling like, uh</pre>
