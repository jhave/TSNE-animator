I want you, Cat (3X)
I want you..

[Chubb Rock]
You're so soft and delicate, may I get, funky
(Funky!)  I'm not a sex junkie
I would like to get high upon your love
You're so silky smooth, just like a dove
It might sound odd
I gave birth the second time around at the promenade
deck, kissed your neck {*smak*}
You gave me more than a peck, but wait a sec
Am I goin too fast, should I just chill
and cool things down, until
I know whassup and I know how you really feel
Cause I got no time for a brain game
But you play one anyway for about a half a year
Tears felt, love went tilt
I said, "What should I do, what should I do, should I step
like stairs, cause I care?"

And I want you, Cat
I want you, Cat (2X)
I want you..

I want you, Cat (3X)
I want you..

[Chubb Rock]
Love understanding, plus demanding
honesty between us two, will make us last for a few
Word up, then you will just.. mmmmmmmm..
Trust me, and maybe never try to bust me
with another squaw, not even in my car
I walk down the street while I kick a 12-bar
rap on the Harlequin tip, chapter 5
Upon my knees, I tell you do I care
Maybe this year, maybe this year
Maybe a little Chubb Rock will be formed upon the scene
His life won't be based upon the dreams
that I might make, when I create a fat rap
Jumpin upon the scene like that

I want you, Cat (3X)
I want you.. (dun-da-duh-da, dun-da-duh-dah)

I want you, Cat (3X)
I want you.. (dun-da-duh-da, dun-da-duh-dah)

I just want you to love me..
Do what you want like Humpty.. does..

I want you, Cat (3X)
I want you..
