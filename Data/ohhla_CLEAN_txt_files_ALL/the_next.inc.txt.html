C'mon D roll, let's go
Yeah, sup motherfuckers?
It's your nigga Irv Gotti on the motherfuckin check in
Me and my nigga sug came to bring ya the new niggaz, the next niggaz
Eastwood, Crooked I, Ronnie Bumps, Dave Bing, Black Child, Caddilac Tah
Santana tell these niggaz what the fuck is up

[Chorus]
Pain, y'all really pressin y'all luck if you tryin to bring it to us
My niggaz don't play
Like them nallies in them Cadillac Trucks
For whoever ready to bust, We all about pain
Is red run and my niggaz stay high (It's the roll for life)
We all about butts and fuckin them sluts ma

[Eastwood]
Nigga put your motherfuckin hands up
I bang a roll when it's a stick-up
Double when I'm in the pick-up
And tie your loud mouth bitch up
Listen we came for murder so I'm aimin to kill
Aimin the steel, cock it back and show me the real
I get high in the moonlight
My brains so sick, Wit a game so thick
We about to tear the frame on shit
I'm the murderest disaster, ghetto child, thug basterd
And I can't be seen before Christ or after

[Crooked I]
Nigga my left hand hold some of the best damn toast
It's Heavier than the weight on a depressed mans show
This is Crooked, the secret ambre
I put so many infa-red dots on shirt
Niggaz would think you was quamade
I'ma get your ass while your passin some indo
Blastin your benzo
And leave half of you face mashed on the passenger window
Then go bang your ho
Plus put her on the hood, that bitch gon bang the road
Ya know

[Chorus]
Pain, y'all really pressin y'all luck if you tryin to bring it to us
My niggaz don't play
Like them nallies in them Cadillac Trucks
For whoever ready to bust, We all about pain
Is red run and my niggaz stay high (It's murda for life)
We all about butts and fuckin them sluts ma

[Ronnie Bumps]
What do you know about parkin a nigga (eve break in his face)
Fo-five straight shakin a nigga
You gon be crying while you crawlin
I got arms and dog I keep fallin (Ya in and out of walls)
With them same niggaz that smoked my man
And I be damned if I die without a gun in my hand
From W.H. get shot die calm
Gettin buried in hate, chi-chi mind move on

[Dave Bing]
Blazin the track better known for slingin crack
Ya paid to rap now niggaz jealous of that (Uh-huh)
It's eatin em up (But we still incin it up)
Screamin murda (Ya we don't give a fuck)
I hate the wild on niggaz, while the style on niggaz (Uh-huh)
When they smile upon bitches tell em make three wishes
But if niggaz wanna front, then they end up in a trunk
On the front seat slumped
Holes in em from the pump (From the pump nigga what)

[Chorus]
Pain, y'all really pressin y'all luck if you tryin to bring it to us
My niggaz don't play
Like them nallies in them Cadillac Trucks
For whoever ready to bust, We all about pain
Is red run and my niggaz stay high (It's murda for life)
We all about butts and fuckin them sluts ma

[Black Child]
I was a late '70's baby
Started playin wit guns and expirimented wit drugs in the early '80's
You could tell the streets raised me
The way I, fondle the 380
My momma did me crazy
Don't ask about my father I didn't have a father figure
The streets was my nigga, heat was my liqour
Theres freaks in my picture anything to get richer
I was wit ya, and leave it to the lord to come get ya

[Caddillac Tah]
Yeah
Man y'all ready to go, when the gun show
Let one go for fun though
Just to let niggaz see how the gun toast
C-A, Double D, I, Double L To the A To the C me
Flyin threw the hood in the C3
Nothin but gangsta is how I like it and live it
Like skies is the limit
From slingin dimes to pridics
Y'all niggaz vide it bitchess
And I sensed it from the door, to senseitive for war
Pull your skirt up motherfucker it's murder

[Chorus]
Pain, y'all really pressin y'all luck if you tryin to bring it to us
My niggaz don't play
Like them nallies in them Cadillac Trucks
For whoever ready to bust, We all about pain
Is red run and my niggaz stay high (It's murda for life)
We all about butts and fuckin them sluts ma</pre>
