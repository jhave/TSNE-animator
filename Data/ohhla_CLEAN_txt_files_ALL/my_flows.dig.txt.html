Verse One [Lord Digga]
Dont test me son
There might be death behind curtain number one
Panthoes niggas get scared and then they run
For the border
Only to prolong they slaughter
Im off the hook, unplugged, outta order
Coming up with shit you never thought of
And if you girl suck dick good I taught her
I flow by the mountain stream niggas is tap water
About to raincheck your style put your flow on back order
Break backs like Atwater
Manslaughter
Maurader at midnight with your daughters
Niggas oughta
Pay attention
Call me Meryl cause Im about to be Lynchin
And I forget to mention
My animal instincts wont allow no flinchin
See cause

Chorus
My flow is tight
My flow is tight
To my niggas all over the world
My flow is tight 4x

Verse Two [Lord Digga]
If I cant get this by flowing
Ima take it without yall niggas knowin
Would hit ya
Fuck up ya city like a twista
Blow up like Arista
Chapapas make a list of the nicest niggas
Get slammed like Dominoes when I deliver
Not hotwings
Or the pizza with the toppings
Tired of niggas flopping
They aint hip they just hopping
From one used style to the next
It happened for the love of the game
Niggas want checks
But need to check themselves
While they albums aint selling collecting dust on shelves
