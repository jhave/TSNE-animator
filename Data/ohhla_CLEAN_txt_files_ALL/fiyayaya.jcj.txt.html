[Intro, Female vocalist]
Step up here, in the club
All eyes all over me

[Hook, Female vocalist]
Got that fiyayaya weed
Fiya-fiyayaya weed
Got that fiyayaya weed
Fiya-fiyayaya weed
Got that fiyayaya weed
Fiya-fiyayaya weed
Got that fiyayaya weed
Fiya-fiyayaya weed

Cause I got it from Khaled, passed out in the ally

With a big brown ass and a face like Halley

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2, Project Pat]
North Memphis...
I'm swag to death, I'm fresh to life, ho
Suck weed smoke outta blunts like lipo-suction
I don't need no introduction
West Coast plug got me back in production
Fiyayaya weed, all buzz and not no seeds
True hustlas from the hood
Always on us, keep some trees
Breath cologne and I smell that kush
Gotta nigga on blast so they swear I push
That Northern Cali sell like heroin
Two p's for the eight g's, I'm tearin up
Package is open, I'm plain outta boat and
Blunts for the cloakin, now we smokin
A candy coating on my Charger
Light the blunt, lets ride my Charger
