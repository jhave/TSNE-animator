When it all boils down, who got the motherfucking crown?
For making that...

	Hard! Street, ghetto rugged
	Beat that'll make your whole crew say "fuck it"
	Hard! Street, ghetto wild
	Beat that'll make you feel my style
	Hard! Street, ghetto beat
	That I play when I think about out in the street, I got the
	Hard! Street, ghetto style

(What about the smooth shit?) Yeah, I can do that too
(What about the groove shit?) Yeah, I can do that too
But when it comes time to rock the block
Who got that old mad ghetto type shit stocked and locked?
Large Pro, for those who don't know which way to go
Listen to your man's latest show with the (Hard!)
Street, you know the routine
On the concrete where the things ain't too clean
And it only gets rougher, and some will have to suffer
I was there, and even had to get my share
But as long as I'm alive I will never forget
What I had to go through to hit
That's why I play the

	Hard! Street, ghetto rugged
	Beat that'll make your whole crew say "fuck it"
	Hard! Street, ghetto wild
	Beat that'll make you feel my style
	Hard! Street, ghetto beat
	That I play when I think about out in the street, I got the
	Hard! Street, ghetto style

You see it's all in my blood so I could never be a dud
The street mentality, I'll have you like "What?"
When you walking around, both feet on the ground,
No lie, about to take a nosedive
Kid it ain't no joke, you either get gat or go broke
Or get busy, the way the world turns you get dizzy
In a spin, so listen to the rhymes I send
They're only a reflection of the times I've been
On the street trying to make it on my own alone
I've grown, and now I'm here to let it be known
That a wish on a star may be too far-fetched to catch
Especially when you're trying to stretch
One dollar to the next on the cement, with mad heads scheming
But they ain't got a chance, they're dreaming
And deal with the real with determination in this burning nation
And listen to the

	Hard! Street, ghetto rugged
	Beat that'll make your whole crew say "fuck it"
	Hard! Street, ghetto wild
	Beat that'll make you feel my style
	Hard! Street, ghetto beat
	That I play when I think about out in the street, I got the
	Hard! Street, ghetto style

You see, if you can make it on the streets
You're live enough to make it any place, I've seen many waste
Mad time and talent, and I just stay silent
Cause I ain't going out trying to teach a nonviolent
Community rap, I had to learn
The streets'll burn any man that is not concerned
With a plan for the future, someone could just shoot ya
On any given, that's why I thank God I'm living
On this here day to relay the message I say about the...

	Hard!  (Repeat 8x)</pre>
