Hey homes
It's Psyklone, vato
Ha-ha
Psyko Funk in the house

[ VERSE 1: Ganxsta R?dd ]
Well, I remember in September you was walkin around the club
Cause the music that deejay played had you standin lookin dumb
I was worried, had to hurry, cause the crowd might go home
So I asked the deejay from the club, "Hm-m, can I gets the microphone?"
He looked up at me all surprised, said, "You ain't even black"
So I palmed his face like a basketball and I threw his ass back
I said I'm not a Doobie Brother, but we do be hip
And there's one thing I dislike when people at a party sit
Now I didn't come here to be judged by the color of my skin
Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. just went Psyko cause they wouldn't let us in
So we bailed on stage and OMB had turned that bass up loud
But before the one-time could pick us up we had already moved the crowd
With psyko funk

(Wop-bop-a-loo-bop)
Psyko Funk
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba..)
(Wop-bop-a-loo-bop-ba-lop-bam-boom)
Psyko Funk
(Wop-bop-a-loo-bop)
Psyko Funk, Funk, Funk
(Wop-bop-a-loo-bop-ba-lop-bam-boom)

[ VERSE 2: Ganxsta R?dd ]
Now we're all in jail for the crime that we all have committed
And the deejay called the one-time, but upfront he couldn't admit it
Now the warden plays our father and we're forced to obey the law
And every morning we wake up with the Psyko Funk roll call
Psyko-alpha-disco-beta-fio-aqua-doo-doo
Fio-aqua-doo-doo, fio-aqua-doo-doo, fio-aqua-doo-doo
Psyko 1, Psyko 2, Psyko 3, Psyko 4
Psyko 5 provides the bass, so it's time he's servin more
Servin time had made us Psyko but the Funk was always there
And if the deejay had some rhythm, Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. wouldn't be in here
But it's times that teach us lessons and there's lessons to be taught
And if it's you who's beein Psyko then it's you who will get caught
With Psyko Funk

(Wop-bop-a-loo-bop)
Psyko Funk
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba..)
(Wop-bop-a-loo-bop-ba-lop-bam-boom)
Psyko Funk
(Wop-bop-a-loo-bop)
Psyko Funk, Funk, Funk
(Wop-bop-a-loo-bop-ba-lop-bam-boom)

(Some of my stories tonight you've probably heard em before
I'ma do a couple of things just to like warm things around a little bit
To relax y'all sip a beer)

[ VERSE 3: Ganxsta R?dd ]
Now the judge has just released us cause we've been inside so long
And the last words he had said: never to sing that Psyko song
So out the courtroom we all go with a slight grin on our face
Cause the judge forgot about Psyko 5, OMB, he provides the BASS
So we asked our booking agent for a stage that we could raid
And he gave us to a crowd of punk rockers, another crime we must engage
Cause Psyko Funk is sure enough funky, had the punks rockin like monkeys
And if your head ain't right and you snap a lot, then it's you who's a Psyko junkie
Psyko Funk

(Wop-bop-a-loo-bop)
Psyko Funk
(Wop-bop-a-loo-bop-ba-lop-bam-boom)
Psyko Funk
(Wop-bop-a-loo-bop)
Psyko Funk, Funk, Funk
(Wop-bop-a-loo-bop-ba-lop-bam-boom)
