[Kurupt]
Yo what's up? (Eh yo what's up Kurupt?)
A nigga been so low that I can't come up
Dippin' down the 101 blazin' smoke
A trunk full of beat and a jar of the doe

[Bad Azz]
Kurupt, Snoop, c'mon let's do the damn thang
Show all the lil' homies how the Dogg Pound bang

[Snoop Dogg]
Mash fast, the upper class
Went from low life to a brotha with cash

[Bad Azz]
Spent all of my time and like half my cash
Went from smokin' dimes to smokin' mafia bags
Went from sometimes to smokin' all in the bath
And Lord knows, I might host the Weed Award Show

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm lookin' for the 105 gettin' off the 405
Mackin' with this bad bitch, she live in Riverside
I met her at the club with my nigga Gotti
5' foot 3, thick with a lot of body

[Kurupt]
That's what I love 'bout the homies (What's that?)
It's just like a nigga gettin' trained, the homie spittin' game
(Nigga) This shit makes no sense
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of 15 cents

[Bad Azz]
And money and funny niggaz don't mix at all
And Cali's the perfect weather to get your chips and ball
So you can touch it while you're here, you could die without it
I'd rather have it, since it really don't matter

[Chorus] - X 2
The world spins around once more
They thought that the West Coast left
But we still gon' flow, uh
Mo' Money 2 Fold
Nigga ice cold
Mo' Money 2 Fold

[Kurupt]
A G is a G which we all know
A bitch is a bitch as a hoe's a hoe
Disrespect his cousin I'ma bank ya (bank ya)
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta

[Bad Azz]
What's three gangstas in a Cadillac?
With TV's, CD's, some weed and three weeks
Chucks and french braids, blunts and gold chains
Hats and white T's and fat gats like po-lice

[Snoop Dogg]
When we on the East Coast we get nothin' but love
All off in the club, DJ holla'd out who we was
I looked around and seen some MC's and grabbed the mic
And then I light they ass up to keep the party on high

[Kurupt]
Hit me on the Motorola, holla at the homie
(What's up Kurupt?!) - Sippin' on a Corona
I'm 'bout to dip through, blaze up a quarta - ounce
Bounce with the homies and make the toy bounce

[Bad Azz]
I like my Hennessy with Coke, I like my weed chronic smoke
I like my - Gin straight, my Benjamin's big faced 
My women give big face, my niggaz get big laced
Big homes and big Bentley Coupe's on chromes

[Snoop Dogg]
We rollin' through the Wild Wild West
No respect to the click, it keeps us on deck
Most niggaz probably wanna bust us or even dust us
The thing is we doin' the right thing so you niggaz can't touch us

[Chorus]
The world spins around once more
They thought that the West Coast left
But we still gon' flow, uh
Mo' Money 2 Fold
Nigga ice cold
Mo' Money 2 Fold

[Bad Azz]
I been on one - fuck a little bit, give me a lot 
I want a state, not an acre, not a block
I want a skyscraper, not no apartment buildin'
And I want billions in case I got part with millions

[Kurupt]
They wonder why they ain't reached the top
That's cause they don't deserve to
Now shut the fuck up 'fore I get my girl to serve you
(Nigga) Playin' no games
So I check a nigga, I ain't sayin' no names

[Snoop Dogg]
How I movin'?, Who I move with? - that's what they wonder
But they just can't seem, to slide up on it
Nigga that don't work his shit up off a corner
I work a bitch from Pomona to Tacoma, nigga ya wanna?

[Kurupt]
Dippin' down the block - where all the homies at
Fleetwoods and 'Llacs, all the homies strapped
Nigga I rise for the hood homeboy
"What up dogg?" - Nah, it ain't all good homeboy

[Snoop Dogg]
Like we said before - your face to the floor
We holdin' up your motherfuckin' candy store
And don't nobody get up 'til we hit the door
(I said lay down, don't look at us!)

[Kurupt]
Dogg Pound Gangstas in grey and blue

[Bad Azz]
Took over the world just by stayin' true
You can bang to the boogie and hang out all late
But get some money to fold because the game don't wait

[Chorus] - X 4
The world spins around once more
They thought that the West Coast left
But we still gon' flow, uh
Mo' Money 2 Fold
Nigga ice cold
