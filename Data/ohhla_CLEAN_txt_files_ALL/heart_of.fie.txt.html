This one, this one so fresh I'm still reading it off the paper man
it's just one of dem' nights you, you know  fuck it
if ya'll don't never hear nothing again from me
you know it was said here
right over here

My people screamed for revenge 
So Fiend was called upon
Job description was get it on
Protect your mental, heart and your dome
You may die cause' of your tone
Young, black and strong
I was meant and sent
Cause' some of the real was all gone
Since birth til' now I got holes in my T-shirt
From fighting with anybody that wants to see me hurt
Took it needle and blood
Second and first love
Fuck giving a fuck
Blame me not the drugs
I motivates myself
Grab a rocket off my shelf
A extra match and now I'm feeling like myself
Without help I could spot and just kill a decoy
Really end what i destroyed


With a heart of a ghetto boy
You have a souljah thats ready to die
Now in the heart of a ghetto boy
If you ask him to live he'll probably say why (why why why)
In a heart of a ghetto boy
You have a souljah thats ready to die
Now in the heart of a ghetto boy
If you ask him to live he'll probably say why (why why why)
In a heart of a ghetto boy
You have a souljah thats ready to die
Now in the heart of a ghetto boy
If you ask him to live he'll probably say why (why why why)

Man I ain't got no million dollars
I'm still in the ghetto
Hear me holler
Mr. 5-0 dollar
Trying to break nobody's collar
Wanting to give the baby something to follow
But shit I'm smoking like coffee lids
Trying to deal with what is
Screaming letta nigga live
And don't kick the door in my crib
I was off he even found where I lived
Now is it a crime to be black?
And walk the streets wit' cha' gat?
To protect family knock somebody off the map
Distributing crack to put clothes on they back
I did it, and still do it if thats where I'm at
But see I'm best where I'm at
Up in this sack right into this back wood
Wanting everyday to be that good


Now in the heart of a ghetto boy
You have a souljah thats ready to die
Now in the heart of a ghetto boy
If you ask him to live he'll probably say why (why why why)
With a heart of a ghetto boy
You have a souljah thats ready to die
Now in the heart of a ghetto boy
If you ask him to live he'll probably say why (why why why)
In a heart of a ghetto boy
You have a souljah thats ready to die
Now in the heart of a ghetto boy
If you ask him to live he'll probably say why (why why why)

Yeah I been facing the depths of hell
For how long?
23 years
And I choose to speak my mind even if its my career
The only fear that i discovered ain't returned and ain't coming
And the faith that I have ain't in no car in no woman
Everyday I'm stumbling to a smarter me
A harder me
Revealing my strength for they try to swallow me
I done read what they didn't want me to read
Learn to need what they didn't want me to need
Shit look I really gotta house full of guns
A couch full of ones
Just in case I don't understand the outcome that life taught
Let me leave you with this thought
Why the lion needed courage and he already had heart....
