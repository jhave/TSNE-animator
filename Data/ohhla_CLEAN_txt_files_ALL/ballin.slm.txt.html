[Slim Thug]
Win, riding in a cock-eyed Benz
Light blue lens, dro'd out with all of my friends
Ball-balling shot calling, 20 inch crawling
Me and them boys all in, something with screens falling
Playing to win, riding in a cock-eyed Benz
Light blue lens, dro'd out with all of my friends
Big ball shot calling, 20 inch crawling
Me and them boys all in, something with screens falling
Candy sprayed, stay at the club L.A
My neck wrist and chest, will show you I'm payed
I'm made-made, like my name's Special Ed
Boy your baby mama giving head, in my Chevy black bed
I'm baller bread, nigga I was raised to grind
Raised to shine, I made heads turn all the time
Hogg-Hogg and Short Stop, in a Bentley soft top
Sharpstown bound, bout to shop till we drop
I can't stop, the cash keep calling
Like Lil' Troy, Slim Thug back to balling
No stalling uh-uh, I stay about that do'
And if you don't know, now you know nigga

(*talking*)
Slim Thugger, E.S.G
T.T., Short Stop, Boss Hogg Outlawz
Put it down, we back to balling
For the 2002, ha
(Pussy's a whole different aspect of life
Wars don't start if the country, if the country over there winning
Pussy is one of the most powerful things in the world
And a lot of people don't understand, how powerful pussy is
Pussy make niggaz blow their brains out, they bitch brains out
Or pussy make people do things they ain't never think they'd do)</pre>
