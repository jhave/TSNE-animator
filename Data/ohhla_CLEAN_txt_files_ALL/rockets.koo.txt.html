[Kool Keith]
Raising levels Jim
Flight seven oh four three two one, red four
Green expanding to one
Moving levers up at seven decimal eight
Moving two point liters down
All systems go, red lights are off
Greens are showing
Coming through

Levels shifting get swift on analog sounds, pounds of rocket tars
Microchips incredible antibiotic medicine, better than Octo
Although created by the master genius
You seen this when I take your mind out to Venus
With the formats on DAT tape you can't remake or duplicate
Hesitate for a minute on deck like Brenlee Stinnit
Pittsburgh Pirate, admire it, you can't hire it
Job applications for rappers with weak shows
Weak flows, by most inherited weakness
You can't stop my uniqueness
Complication altitudes built in compartments
Digital gizmo made by Continental Lincoln keepin you thinkin
Better made than European's robot John H. Thomas
Model seven decimal put out by Jaguar
without the automatic chemical release
emergency vomit regurgitates any system
Regular or even more antique products, put out by top, companies
MCA Warner Brothers Loud the Polygram enterprise
Virgin masters get melted, you felt it
through my radiation, foes move on buses
Planes leave the train station, evacuate quick!

	Mechanical legs, mechanical legs

Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to port control seven"
(Now, meow, blah!)
Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to port control seven"
(Goin wild with our sound now!)
Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to port control seven"
Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to port control seven"

Release date M6, photographs on Columbia/Ruffhouse description green
with blue ears sky blue shirt that work by remote controls
Burn up Billboard charts, deactivating 1975 music, old soul
will never go gold, while records warp
Insulting your duplicating of a sample
You will become an example, uncreative peasants
by the lessons of the untalented ones
signed by your most stupidest A&amp;R
We'll see how far representation information
Documents while I stand like monuments
Stun your area like a airborne carrier
United Parcel deliver parts for a start
Cold blooded with a mechanical heart, standin like the Tinman
Aluminum kneecaps release raps like rayguns, destroyin territories
Toys, pterodactyl dinosaurs get bombed in space wars
Layin on galactic floors, amputated, disconnected collections
in more than, fifty seconds, wherehouse with skulls
Land amphibians, welfare recipients
with beautiful women from the Carribean
The ships need repair

Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to port control seven"
Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to port control seven"
Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to port control seven"
Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to port control seven"

Not compared to no rappin high flight, member of the A.S.S.R.
Immigrants stand in factories, endorsements, six MC's
You seen what The Source meant
Cover stories from the government left you standin
holdin the mic with one hand and
handicapped with damage you can't manage style nine-nine
2000 B.C. the sneakers in spascious me in 3-D
Wireless radius, MC's outdated, completion deleted
Japan newspapers in Australia, did you read it?
Over and out, movin with swift celsius, I melted him down
Jet movin up, level seven seven six oh
with Darth Vader and 3P0
R2-D2, me too, comin to see you

Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to port control seven"
Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to port control seven"
Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to port control seven"
Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to port control seven"
Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to port control seven"
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to port control seven"</pre>
