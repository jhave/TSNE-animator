[Jermaine Dupri]
Y'all know what this is

[Chorus]
When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast, I ain't never came weak
Got a mouth full of diamonds you can hardly hear me speak
Specially when it sound like this, this
It's the H-Town baby and you know what it is
I'm throwed
Got a styrofoam cup full o' barre
I'm throwed
Four deep in my old school car
I'm throwed
Chokin' Cali while I'm bangin' the screwed
It's the Ice Man baby and you know what it do
I'm throwed

[Paul Wall]
Fresher than a fruit bowl
Leanin' like a gas gauge
Straight up off the down streets
Stylin' like hair braids
Makin' that candy dance
I'm throwed off the Cali plants
I'm prancin' on the scene crawlin' down like fire ants
My mind in a trance
I'm sharper than starched pants
Stackin' Franklins and Grants from South Bank to Spring Ranch
I'm posted like a stamp with my mind on cash
I'm wheel grippin' and still tippin' brandy wine on glass
I got a screen in the dash
A quarter-tank full of gas
Smokin' that puff puff pass
Throwed I hope I don't crash
Reppin' that Swisha Blast song flyer than a mockin' bird
Throwed in the mold game cold as a iceberg, baby

[Chorus]
When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast, I ain't never came weak
Got a mouth full of diamonds you can hardly hear me speak
Specially when it sound like this, this
It's the H-Town baby and you know what it is
I'm throwed
Got a styrofoam cup full o' barre
I'm throwed
Four deep in my old school car
I'm throwed
Chokin' Cali while I'm bangin' the screwed
It's the Ice Man baby and you know what it do
I'm throwed

[Paul Wall]
Now with the broads I'm a sharp shooter like Steve Kerr
Flash the wrist cause a glare fox fur and flyin' spur
I'm disputed for sure so I'm collectin' these dimes
Name ya number lil mama cus it's check out time
I'm slidin' on glass threes inhalin' the chronic trees
Pack protection cus playa hatin' spread like STDs
I'm cool as an ocean breeze
Like Chester I'm chasing cheese
I'm stangin' like buzzin' bees
On South Lee with the G's
Screens fall like autumn leaves
Make the TVs rain
Take a picture if you please
Yeah, my wrist is the same
30 carat diamond chain so ballin' is off the chain
Mind frame: I'm stackin' change
I'm so throwed in the game

[Chorus]
When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast, I ain't never came weak
Got a mouth full of diamonds you can hardly hear me speak
Specially when it sound like this, this
It's the H-Town baby and you know what it is
I'm throwed
Got a styrofoam cup full o' barre
I'm throwed
Four deep in my old school car
I'm throwed
Chokin' Cali while I'm bangin' the screwed
It's the Ice Man baby and you know what it do
I'm throwed

[Paul Wall]
Cup full of that purple Sprite
And I'm searchin' for broads
Paper stackin' so my money stretch like extension cords
I'm a widebody rocker and a foreign on choppers
I'm on the grind stackin' up my mail like the post office
Movin' at slow pace with T-Ferris my ace
Cup full of expensive taste
Open mouth and showcase
I'm throwed with screens hangin' swangin' breakin' the struts
We pourin' up in them cups that stuff got me leanin' tough
Hold up
I'm caked up so all the boppers attract
I got 'em like a soccer mile out there runnin' the track
Pullin' capers makin' paper stacks fly as a dove
A bread breaker, taste maker, baby
All of the above
I'm throwed

[Chorus]
When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast, I ain't never came weak
Got a mouth full of diamonds you can hardly hear me speak
Specially when it sound like dis, dis
It's the H-Town baby and you know what it is
I'm throwed
Got a styrofoam cup full o' barre
I'm throwed
Four deep in my old school car
I'm throwed
Chokin' Cali while I'm bangin' the screwed
It's the Ice Man baby and you know what it do
I'm throwed

[Jermaine Dupri]
Shawty I need to see somebody do that
That southside one time
Come on</pre>
