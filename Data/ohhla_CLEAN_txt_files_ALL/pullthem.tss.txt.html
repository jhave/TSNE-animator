[Chorus: Kool Ace]
Wanna see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down
Gotta see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down

[Too $hort]
You made a lot of money since you hit the stage
Swingin' on the pole so many different ways
Got hit with a butt cheek and smacked ya back
You're a dancer but you shoulda been a acrobat
I don't even know if it's bald or bushy
I see them titties out girl but I ain't saw no pussy
What we gotta do to see you get butt naked
and shake it, how much you tryin' to make bitch?
You could do it easily, is this how you gon' do me?
You're teasin' me, pulled 'em halfway down your booty
You need to let them panties meet them ankles
Show 'em you a bad bitch, fuck these stank hoes
You know I go hard all night
I'm famous, I've been a star all my life
You need to take them draws off
Do it girl, take it all off

[Chorus: Kool Ace]
Wanna see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down
Gotta see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down

[Too $hort]
Take that g-string off, take everything off
Why you still wearin' clothes, girl you must be lost
Let that monkey out, go 'head do your thang
Take them panties off, and let that pussy hang
If we was at my house, I don't play that
I'd get you undressed, I'd make you stay wet
I'd burn a lot of rubber, all in your walls
When you fuck with me bitch you gotta drop yo' draws

[Chorus: Kool Ace]
Wanna see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down
Gotta see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down

[Too $hort]
Broke nigga what you doin' here?
You ain't even bought nothin' new this year
It's some people in here that don't like you
They lookin' at you mean, right now they wanna fight you
You know you can't win, hangin' with your scary ass friends
Flossin' at the club but you never had a Benz
Now these bitches wanna hurt you
They say you act gay, you probably wear skirts too
That's what they say, they callin' you a faggot
It might be a problem, you better call some back-up
Fuck a credit card, can't go to Western Union
Use the ATM, or just keep it movin'
Ain't nobody chasin' you, not if you ain't runnin'
But if you in this club man you gotta spend some money
He don't wanna buy a dance but he can't stop lookin'
Nigga ducked and he ran out the club and he shook him, beotch!

[Chorus: Kool Ace]
Wanna see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down
Gotta see the pink now
Go and pull them panties down</pre>
