[Intro/Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor, to bring me back to liiiiiiife

[Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin that
Doubt's startin to creep in, every day is just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
and I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest!
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick, you
gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin mic or you
gon' hug me but I'm out of options, there's nothin else I can do
Cause

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled, cause the shit I hear
is crazy but you're either gettin lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinion's not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin yourself
Second guessin and it's almost like you're beggin for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin be my mentor
I can endure, no more; I demand you remember who you are!
It was YOU, who believed in me, when EVERYONE was tellin you
don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin label, let's tell the TRUTH!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre I'm cryin in this booth!
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I could never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin up faith, and you ain't givin up on me, GET UP DRE!
I'm dyin, I need you! Come back for fuck's sake!
Cause

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Skylar Grey]
Bring me back to liiiiiiiiife {*2X*}
I need a doctor, doctor, to bring me back to liiiiiiife

[Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jumpsuit, whole room cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
Went through friends, some of 'em I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin to the death - but where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of 'em, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is HIM!
Fuckin backstabbers, when the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin wrath of Aftermath faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
and ask where the fuck we been? You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots
and the cracker's ass, little Cracker Jack
Beat-makin wack ass backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin up my bags
And as I'm leavin I guarantee they'll scream "Dre, don't leave us like that man!"
Cause
