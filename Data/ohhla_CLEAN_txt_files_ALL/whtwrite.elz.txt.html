(*sample repeated throughout the song*)

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I write about the streets and how life is expirin
Mainly through a choir then
Neighbors inquirin, hearin shots firin
Police sirens, been in car chases, I be in Scarface's tire and
Snitches per-spirin, cause they wearin wires when 
They know they can be killed by who built the steet empires and
It's hard to get a job, cause ain't nobody hirin
And more people get laid off, than retirin
I write about the liar, the preacher with the choir and
The church who didn't soul search and never was desirin
How money's inspirin, the youth and the environment
Just tryin to get flyer than the elders they admirin
Don't want to be a fireman, cause dealers get you high and
Spend dough, buy a Benz and furnish they entire den
Look into my eyes again, see it for yourself
See the jewel is for your brain, the G is for your wealth

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs
Sometimes you may hear me writin that next shit
Different from how some rhyme
You like it when I write that hit
You love it when I write that shit
Sure you do, don't try to fight that
So when I hear a beat, an idea appears (suddenly)
Then another rhyme is written (suddenly)
I put it down, put it out, you listen to it then it hits your soul
(suddenly) Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah ...)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I write about the ladies, the ones with the tatas and the apple bottoms
They ones I gave the eye highs to when I got on 
Because before they didn't cherish me
I write about the smart ones, the ones that need therapy
Them hoodrat broads, them afrocentric queens
And them ones that let you get between their jeans for the green
I wrote about my exes, Takara, Alexis
To write about the next miss and how great the sex is
ones who were sexist, those who throw hexes
Crack Beckses and ask you were your Lex is
That baby mama drama, them drama mama babies
The skeez, the ones who like to tease, but are the maybe's
The independent ladies, hookers and them daisies
The sane ones, the crazies, the straight ones, the gays, deez
Are women that have been in my life
Now will it end when I begin with a wife?
I don't know

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs
Sometimes you may hear me writin that next shit
Different from how some rhyme
You like it when I write that hit
You love it when I write that shit
Sure you do, don't try to fight that
So when I hear a beat, an idea appears (suddenly)
Then another rhyme is written (suddenly)
I put it down, put it out, you listen to it then it hits your soul
(Suddenly) Yeah, yeah, one more time, check it out

Sometimes you may hear me writin that next shit
Different from how some rhyme
You like it when I write that hit
You love it when I write that shit
Sure you do, don't try to fight that
So when I hear a beat, an idea appears (suddenly)
Then another rhyme is written (suddenly)
I put it down, put it out, you listen to it then it hits your soul
(Suddenly) Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah ...)

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I write about a theme
From out a motion picture or somethin out a dream
Or in a chosen scripture, a fictional novel
The WAIT your alive so
Like a revival, Jesus and rival
There's really no rival
I'm too diverse, when I do my verse
You, you, die worse
Rather rap shit or battle, decoy, slowly rot
Like it or not boy, it's gon' be hot
Street shit, club shit, the flow blow the spot
Like it or not boy, it's gon' be hot
Girl shit, brag shit, your boy knows me not
If he ever doubts (boy it's gon' be hot!) (hot)
