[Chorus]
They mad at me
Check got Os, diamonds in my chain (they mad at me)
Good got Jordan's, the sun in my Range (they mad at me)
Pass by don't speak to the hatas (they mad at me)
House got marble floors and escalators (they mad at me)
Stay G'd up sharp as a razor (they mad at me)
Guess they ain't neva seen a playa (they mad at me)
My girl in Luis that and Fendi this (they mad at me)

[Verse 1]
Ain't my fault, smooth
Can't eve ride down the street without somebody screamin
The woman love me and even the fellas be teamin
But see I hate male groupies, so jus steop the hell off
Look but don't touch as I bail off, handle, wheel, and the clutch
I love what I'm doin ?? Support me and stop the hate
If I gave you 50 Gs to shut up you'd be straight
Sike, It won't happen
Look hurr I ain't jus rappin
I make it happen, like a captain, 2nd to none, I'm draftin
Holdin my own, I'm grown and do what I choose to
Ya like the blueberry Bentley
Though I ain't hurr to amuse you
I got a safe in a place you will prolly never find it
Bein mad at me like bein mad at the game
I designed it

[Chorus]

Ay, look at the rims on that car (tire screech)
Uh, dubs rub the cizzurb
Got the drink and izzerb
Floatin thought the city, man I gottz leave the subizzurb
Man, with the tvs and the wood expand, front to back
Plus and that flat flask black max, in the trunk you pump
Never take what I earn
Jus made a million plus, we got money to burn
Catch me in the quarter ?? Wit the triple arm
Hoppin out G'd up, dangling my DTP charm
Gotta get in and I'm wit it, it's a must
I talk it, you see that gold
If you want it, it's a must
You walk it
Baby blue Benz, old school, 74 hoe next to the blue
and grey Rolls wit the blue and grey doles
Yea

[Chorus]

Yo, national bridge I'm headin to
Uh, O'Fallon mark the spot
On Sunday Buck be heated
Cuz we peep 2s that'll make you need to live or treat it
I hustle wit the raps like ounces of crack
Weigh it to my playa, sharp fools play it up
Never let a freak stroll, keep hoes on hold
Jus to talk to me, exciting like the Rams Superbowl
And I put that on goals if I don't blow
now I'ma repo this whole industry and its gon go down
W'sup wit it
See me glow in the dark
Catch me in the Northwest plaza buyin up the large
I paid my dues, don't get mad, jus let me ball
When they see lil Howard they gon be like naaaawww

[Chorus]</pre>
