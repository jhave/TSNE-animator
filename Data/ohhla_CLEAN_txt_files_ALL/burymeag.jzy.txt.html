[2] Nigga put some motherfuckin holes in that nigga
[1] Ay, wutup blood?
{gun shots} {screams}
[1] Yeah nigga, fuck you nigga

[Verse 1]
Four shots in the chest, why niggaz get at me?
They done fucked around and fucked up my new white tee
I'm just living my life, why they mad at me?
Woke up this morning, I ain't see this coming
Should I even bust back? You ain't see me running
I hope heaven got a V.I.P. lounge
Got some partners in hell that'll sneak me in the back door
You know I hate waiting in line
Paramedics on the way but they wasting they time
Everybody standing over, nigga's screaming and shit
Damn, ya'll give a nigga a second to think
Which one of you niggaz shot me, it was one of you bastards
Bet my nigga Kink throw a hundred grand in my casket

[Chorus]
Pour out a little liquor
Bury me in some Evisu jeans
A U.S.D.A. top and a throw away glock
Bury me a G, nuthin more, nuthin less
When I get where I'm going I just gotta be fresh
Pour out a little liquor
Bury me in some Evisu jeans
A U.S.D.A. top and a throw away glock
Bury me a G, nuthin more, nuthin less
When I get where I'm going I just gotta be fresh

[Verse 2]
We expect the worst, but hope for the best
But you know how it is, amen, god bless
I can't leave now, niggaz owe me money
My nigga on the west side owe me bout a dub
And my partner with a few, shit he owe a nigga too
I shoulda, hugged my son, shoulda kissed my mother
Spent some time with her, show her I love her
Every night she was praying for me, I was in the streets
Active little nigga, shit I stayed in some beef
Loochy going through some real shit and he really need me
And what about the streets? Shit they need me too
Almost forgot Def Jam, shit they owe a nigga too

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Announcer]
We interrupt this program to bring you this breaking news story
I'm Kelly Washington reporting for WKKT, Channel 7
Witnesses say that around 1:45 this morning
Shots were fired outside of an Atlanta nightclub
Rapper Young Jeezy was involved in the shooting
But at this time it is unclear whether he was the suspect or the victim
We'll bring you further details as they become available
Back to you...back to you...back to you...
{Whoa...It's hard to believe he's a child}

[Verse 3]
I was, on my way, I was almost gone
I was almost there, I was almost home
On some Kanye shit, tryin to Touch the Sky
Jesus walks, God testify
I'm a Legend like John, we Ordinary People
You only get one life, there's no sequel
So you can't take nothing for granted
And don't take granted for nothing
So I gotta thank God for waking me up this morning
Ay, and giving me this air to breathe
Please Lord forgive me for every gram I sold
Every, glock I popped, every rock I chucked

[Chorus]</pre>
