[Talib Kweli]
Time is of the essence, and waits for no man
Now is the time to get down with the program
It's time to get busy, it's time to get involved
You got a problem with that, it's time to get it solved
Time flys when you havin' fun, I'll be in the throne for a long time
All you haters pack a lunch, it's time to stack your funds
There comes a time to run and grab your gun
And there's a time to admit when you haven't won
Used to be nation time, but now we facin' time
Ain't no replacin' time homie, why you wastin' time?
They say time is money, and so I spend it wisely
on quality goods so with the family's where you tend to find me
If you're lookin', my people keep on pushin'
Across the bridge to another time like we did to get to Brooklyn
I climb through the windows of the mind, I unravel mysteries
Go back in history, see how I time travel

[Chorus: Dion]
(Time) I've been racin' up this time
Tryin' my best to find my way (Time)
Change the world in just one day
Goin' crazy (Time)
I've been racin' up this time
Tryin' my best to find my way (Time)
Change the world in just one day

[Talib Kweli]
Take the time, rewind and make your mind up
Get on your grind, put in the work until your time's up
Like O.C. let the poetry remind ya
of why we at the top of our game, this here is timeless
They lack the minerals and vitamins with time release
And so they try to blind you with the diamonds in they time pieces
Okay you got money and we all can see it, great
Now rhyme about somethin' time don't appreciate
You don't appreciate the time, that it take
to make a rhyme, I don't just educate or fascinate
My facts is straight, I don't exaggerate when I say
I was gettin' some head, phony rappers I decapitate
I'm gettin' my bread, kids is fed, it's time to build
It's time to find a skill, it's time to find a strength
It's time to find a will and we ain't got the time to kill, one another
They got us swallowin' all kind of pills, they tryin' to drug us
Not again, not this time

[Chorus: Dion]
(Time) I've been racin' up this time
Tryin' my best to find my way (Time)
Change the world in just one day
Goin' crazy (Time)
I've been racin' up this time
Tryin' my best to find my way (Time)
Change the world in just one day

[Talib Kweli]
Yeah, it's Blacksmith, we got them classics in the pipeline
The people ready right now, this the right time
The right kind of flavor that age like a fine wine
Past, present or future, it's all in the same timeline
So currently I'm standin' on the shoulders of my ancestors
And throwin' up the sign of the times like hand gestures
The man next to the man you tryin' to stand next to
Ain't impressed by your routine, you too damn extra
It's time to start a movement, it's time to start improvin'
If everybody a pimp, then who the prostitutes
and where the hell is our solution, it's time to handle problems
It's time to stand for somethin', it's time to channel Marvin...</pre>
