I'm talkin to you

I know you won't bust a gun (Yeah I'm talkin to you)
fuck nigga you can hate all you wanna hate
I know you a fake-make no mistake I'm talkin to you

I say it you know what ya name is (I'm talkin to you)
we can shoot it out whenever you wanna
whatever you wanna do boi I'm talkin to you

[T.I.]
Ay I'm the best you ever heard about, fresher than you heard about
yeah I'm strapped now pussy nigga this ain't just word of mouth
for niggaz wit dirty mouths, I got a lotta clean pistols to wash 'em out
I'm really finna give yo ass some hotter shit to talk about
the goons hit the room now you askin what's this all about
fo' you know it ya noggins split ya bottom teeth is fallin out
got a problem wit patna -I see him in the city and call him out
it wasnt for the chopper ain't shit I'm gettin all of mine
pop 'em drop 'em call the plan a wake he out forever more
I give it to you straight nigga I don't need a metaphor
how many different ways is it to say I'm getting cheddar more
a nigga twice as old way mo' popular need to set at all
Man I just say it to my pops, maybe he could tell ya better boy
patient in the afterlife I'll waste ya in the after life
even after my life haters be after my life
cuz I'ma do in 06 what took 'em half of they life, man I'm talkin to you

[Hook]

[T.I.]
I ain't talkin to Jeezy cause thats my brother
ain't talkinto Face cause that's my father
ain't talkin to Bun cause that's my uncle
ain't talkin to Kast cause them ma patnas
ain't talkin to Jigga cause that's my nigga, the Real President carter
gave me Diplomatic Immunity you and me why bother
man all I gotta do is go buy a nigga a charger
and he only come in to offer he don't even wanna rob ya
you done fucked up and started shit wit some real shit starter
you don fought with a chopper holla what it is patna
you better keep it proper you know what it is patna
this some lightwork ain't even gotta call godfather
Mobsta, had the old phantom now the drop son
3rd the king of cloverland, Slim thug is the boss son
Paul Wall made me the hardest grill I done bought for
for a 100 K ,a 100 carat paul don't wanna talk bra
nigga wouldn't buck won't dare, you just talk tough
don't try to run from me now whatchu thought bra I'm talkin to you

[Hook]

[T.I.]
I ain't talkin to Buck cause he a real nigga
ain't talkin 2 Pimp cause he a trill nigga
ain't talkin 2 BG cause he like me, with old cases and will kill niggaz
I know you wannabe just like me since you got ya new record deal nigga
But I don't give a fuck if you like me no second diss ya not trill nigga
ya in ya video wearin white T that don't make you no dope dealer nigga
But I ain't talkin bout no bankhead, carver homes, no adamsville nigga
you dealin wit a lil gorilla nigga
10 mill later I'm still the nigga
Killer Mike, Yung bloodz, David Banner
Bonecrusher they remember when y'all ain't feel a nigga
Had it out with Chris he still my nigga
sat down,civilized talk about it like niggaz
so I ain't never been served get ya facts right nigga
for this 40 cal make ya ass act right nigga
coming against the king get ya stats right nigga
wanna talk about nigga, wanna be a hot nigga
gonna be a shot nigga, yeah I say'd it what nigga buck nigga
like Lil Jon I don't give a fuck
I give a God damn if I never sell another milla
I take my ass right back to sillahillabilla
compound come down everyday sell yay
Just like the old days stack another mill up
niggaz ain't ready for the dust that we kick up
go talk shit forget they get hit up
You better be bout that shit you kick
Like DipSet bitch you trynna get wit us
I don't Politic, don't even speak see I don't kiss up
Gotta be Styles or Sheek to Jadakiss us
Diss us... that's goin piss us...
See I love it when the government pick niggaz
If you don't hang in the air by the name of Swizz Beatz
Told Mannie Fresh he the Skateboard P
Clay J-G and Just Blaze taking basically I'm talkin to you</pre>
