Verse 2: [Webbie]
I'm goin 55 in the burbon straight swervin
With a high yellow fine virgin and we swervin
Hollerin I'm a fool boy ya heard me straight swervin
A nigga behind me in the excursion and he swervin
Hit the parkin lot by the club just swervin
Headlights shinin on my dubs while I'm swervin
I keep an old pistol on my lap while I'm swervin
Just in case I have to peel a cap while I swerve
I play the 6 by 9's with the slap while I'm swervin
I gotta have the killa and the yak while I'm swervin
A four or five hunderd dollar stack big swervin
Smokin on some doesha early Monday and I been swervin since Thursday
Red bones in the back got me swervin
Shit I done took my eyes up off the road when I was rubbin on that cat
Doin it big like that nigga swervin
It's all good we on the map Baton Rouge where you at swerve

[Chorus 2 repeats twice]

Verse 3: [Boosie]
This for my dogs in penitentiary (in the pen)
Who holla shit like gutter gutter when you mention me
And Hennessy
Man that hen got me swervin crazy (swervin crazy)
I saw a dime turned my head and almost hit a lady
Slow down baby
With lil bleet hollerin in the back (in the back)
I'm in my sts lil jr in my other lac
Don't fuck with Hatch
Cause I'll hit you with that nina ross (that nina ross)
It's on your head bitch you dead I'll pay the cost
Cause I'm a boss
In the South side of Baton Rouge
Where niggaz swervin on them 20's and them 22's
We act a fool
Back in the game I used to go to dreams (dreams)
In my firebird on them choppers with them fuckin screens
sippin that lean
Actin like I never had shit
Bust your head in traffic
I'll wrap you up in plastic
Show your ass magic
Abrah kadabrah kadoo here go lil boo

Every hood in Baton Rouge it's all good swerve
