Song:   Last Goodbye
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I remember the night
We first met
We were so young
I can't forget
How you kissed my face
(Woah, oh-oh-oh)
And you took me home
(Woah, oh-oh-oh)

I remember the life
Years ago
The air mattress
On the floor
That was before
(Woah, oh-oh-oh)
Life took control

Oh, how we lost our minds
When we fell in love that night
I never thought that I
Would ever leave your side

Oh, how we lost our minds
When we fell in love that night
Promise me you won't cry
This is our last goodbye

When I was lost
I found you
When I was broke
You bought me shoes
You were my first
(Woah, oh-oh-oh)
And, damn, if this hurts
(Woah, oh-oh-oh)

Now you've got a girl
Someone new
And I can't pretend
To just be cool
I can't be your friend
(Woah, oh-oh-oh)
So this is the end

Oh, how we lost our minds
When we fell in love that night
I never thought that I
Would ever leave your side

Oh, how we lost our minds
(We lost our minds)!
When we fell in love that night
Promise me you won't cry
This is our last goodbye

Na na na, na na na na
Na na na, na na na na
Promise me you won't cry
This is our last goodbye

Our last goodbye

Oh, how we lost our minds
When we fell in love that night
I never thought that I
Would ever leave your side

Oh, how we lost our minds
(We lost our minds)!
When we fell in love that night
(Love that night)
Promise me you won't cry
(Oh), this is our last goodbye
(Our last goodbye)

Na na na, na na na na
Na na na, na na na na
Promise me you won't cry
This is our last goodbye

Our last goodbye</pre>
