[Bathgate]
Now everybody put your middle finger in the air
and repeat after me...(nah fuck that!)
I'm tired of bitches riffin and trippin (nah fuck that!)
You owe a nigga cause he went to prison (nah fuck that!)
You ain't giving head? Ma let me beat it
Oh you a sain't now but you pushing me to eat it (nah fuck that!)
All of a sudden Harlem ain't real like
We ain't up for money, and we started pushing grills? (nah fuck that!)
Everybody saying this and that like Bath be dat nigga
Dat be spittin on them tracks
Like, bullshit record labels
Who, come at me with offers
Like, eight fucking albums and you sure this just a hoax (nah fuck that!)
Fake bad bitches front when you holla
Cause you ain't in the fire, but you walking right beside us (nah fuck that!)
Ma don't let them front on you there
They ain't pay to get it done
but want they fingers in your hair (nah fuck that!)
Bitches with babies asking for dollars
Talkin how they get this Prada
But don't know they baby father
An shorty run around with Gucci on her feet
With a Gap outfit, like that shit is really sweet (nah fuck that!)
Niggaz who charge fifty is shitty (nah fuck that!)
Wack ass albums, nigga come get me (nah fuck that!)
Bath the hottest though, who fuckin wit me
Not that nigga in your box, you really think that nigga hot (nah fuck that!)
Some say that kid ain't nice, cause that song to hot
No that kid didn't write, like I don't ghost write
Like I don't flow tight, who that nigga
that just figure that he wont go like(nah fuck that!)
You know them broads who came at me wrong like
"Boo you look young," but don't know that I'm grown (nah fuck that!)
This is for my teams on the block
push green or da rocks 16's in them glocks (nah fuck that!)
Bitch ass cops with hand triggers (nah fuck that!)
Protect shit and air niggaz
Just a bunch of hate crimes like rape and Louima
And murdering Diallo spittin slugs for no meanings
And they feel its okay, when they set up O.J.
But they wanna bag Jay and Puff and throw the key away (nah fuck that!)
Hollywood rappers who never sold that
Get they jewelry, last week it was gone (nah fuck that!)
Bring back them 4.0''s everybody ain't rich to go add on the 6 (nah fuck that!)
Thats right you only live once
Fuck it, spend how you wanna go
Trick on them stunts, if you do a little Ex
Or, hit a few blunts
Get High! Get Crunk!
Have fun! Get drunk! (nah fuck that!)
Niggaz who come at you with tapes
Like, "It easy cause you signed" and they wont have to wait (nah fuck that!)
Hearing out every beat weight, when you find what you like
Shit, it ain't on the tape (nah fuck that!)
Look dogs I'ma be grave, fuck a feature they don't want
This shit is hot anyway, any day we can battle dog verse for verse
Fuck will I'ma curse, matter fact, FUCKIN JERK!  (nah fuck that!)

Aye shorty, if you gon' get the Gucci shoes, get the Gucci outfit to match
Gap don't match with that shit ma...Ya heard?
Harlem is back, expect it and respect it nigga
but girl you got anything to say? NAH FUCK THAT!!!! </pre>
