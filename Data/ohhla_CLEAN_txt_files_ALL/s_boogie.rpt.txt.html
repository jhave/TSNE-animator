Yeah nigga... Westcoast
Westcoastin', floatin', oh so floatin'
Nigga!... G'z... Young Gotti

I'm like... fuck a bitch and fuck you too
It's so many different things that i'm gon' do
Switches all fucked up
Livin' in the '80's jackin' niggas for Nissan trucks
A quarter piece to flip
It's me and Daz and two bitches
I never gave a fuck, nigga Daz and Kurupt
They say this ain't the way to get rich!
I might as well get me a bitch!
I don't get it, I take it
Put a glitch in the Matrix
Flip some bricks to strip ya bitch naked
'Cause I just don't care, live from "G" square
Wit a vest and a cup to put in the air
Nigga... fuck a bitch and fuck you too
What a punk mothafucka like you gon' do?
... I holla'd at Dr. Dre, hit up Bigg Snoop
Wit the candy cut-cut perfectly on fued
It's on one, nah he said it's on two
On fifteen shells, ducked and detailed, de-railed
All you to want do
Do what the fuck you want to do too
Get what ya got to get to get through
Light what ya wanna light to light fire
Big arsonist blew to white fire
Blast through ya home or blast to hit doors
Crap like the crap table, Kane and Abel
I'm signed-out Sinatra, galactic Gallahgar
Metal physical, sixteen Calibur metallica
'Sane asylum shanker, big and little banker
Punk mothafucka, mothafuck, mothafucka, yeah nigga 
We can go heads nigga
You bitches be hatin' nigga, heard what I said nigga
Lend me some bread nigga, keep ya chest bust like lead niggas
The fed nigga, Daz and Fred nigga
Kurupt Young Gotti, baby face Capone
We on Niastra, nigga on the microphone
Never never have I ever gave a fuck
Dat Nigga Daz Dillinger, Fred, Kurupt
And we do what the fuck we want to do too
Get what we got to get to get through
And we blast what we got blast to get ours
Life of a gangsta in a world of stars
Light what ya wanna light to light fire
Big arsonist blew to white fire
Do what the fuck you want to do too
Get what ya got to get to get through, through, through
Just do it... don't stop

All my niggas on the Northside, getcha money right away
All my niggas on the Southside, let 'em know that you don't play
And say them niggas on the Eastside, ain't some niggas you contest
Unless you stuck up in a time-warp, you all ready know about the West
They say them niggas on the Northside, keep tabs on they skrill
All my niggas on the Southside, try to make anotha mil'
All my niggas on the Eastside, make million dollar bills
All my niggas on the Westside, been doin' this fo' years

Throw ya mothafuckin' hood up somebody
What dem niggas do, they ride

Throw ya mothafuckin' hands up somebody
Throw ya mothafuckin' hood up somebody
What dem niggas do, they ride
What dem niggas do, they ride, ride
