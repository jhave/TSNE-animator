Typed by: chrisandoval2004@yahoo.com

Intro (Imogen Heap):

Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut outs
speak no feeling no I don't believe you
you don't care a bit, you don't care a bit

Chorus (Imogen Heap):

This is what we need, you decided this
Whatcha say (x4)

Verse 1 (Chris Styles):

Fuck a love song, I'm lookin' for my enemies
I don't even know what the hell has gotten into me
I guess I got tired of the drama and the bullshit
finger on the trigger? guarantee they never pull shit
they rap about that mob shit, that's not what I'm about
I get paid to make hits, they can be the hottest out
killers with no bodies, will I ever blow? probably
look around, who can do it like me? nobody
put a milli' on it, I could give it to you if you really want it
put me on a song with anybody, bet I (Kill 'em on it) (easy)
rest in peace to the beat, it's bleeding on me
on the remix with Wayne, I don't see opponents
If a hater want it I ain't losing to him
I call it revenge, his partners call it losin' a friend
again, I'm the people's hope? I'm a do it for them
and do it like nobody gon' do it again (Styles)

Chorus(Imogen Heap):

This is what we need, you decided this
Whatcha say (x4)

Verse 2 (Lil Wayne): 

(Yeah, come on) Call me Weezy baby, (yup)
hands up, tech wavin'
Hey now, lay down like a nigga put a bed down
Sleep tight, die in a dirt cheap life
Suit tucked, tie and the shirt, speech nice
Lumps in throats, trumpet blow (gone)
Where we at daddy, guns and coke (home)
the quiet is woke the riot's provoked (bomb)
All them busters allowed me to suffer, and
she know not to ever fuck around with the fuckers, and
Stop looking up that mountain above you
Have you looking under cars, inspecting mufflers
(yeah) that's reality baby, check your calendar
Every day's a new day and this can be the last one (Come on, yeah)
So you better make it pay off
or make a nigga scratch a day off (Weezy)

Chorus (Imogen Heap):

This is what we need, you decided this
Whatcha say (x4)

Outro (Imogen Heap):

ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut outs
speak no feeling no I don't believe you
you don't care a bit,
you don't care a bit

ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut outs
speak no feeling no I don't believe you
you don't care a bit,
you don't care a bit

you don't care a bit
you don't care a bit
you don't care a bit
you don't care a bit
you don't care a bit</pre>
