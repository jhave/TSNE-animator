[Intro]
10, 9, 8, 7
6, 5, 4, 3
2, 1 (uhh)

[Ludacris]
Never scared to be different
The impossible's put into existence
For in-stance, this is me
What did you expect from the 5th LP
Gone for a minute now I'm back again
Back to back, back to break backs again
Put 'em in the back seat of the 'Llac again
And rip off the Magnum packagin
What's happenin, I'm lookin for some girls gone willllld (gone willlld)
I'm just tryin to make these girls all smilllle (all smilllle)
And I'm gonna make 'em dance, so I
Can see 'em shake they ass, then I'll
Put 'em in a trance, 'til I
Get 'em out them pants, then I'll
Take 'em to a level that they mighta never been befo'
We gon' hit the do' and then hit the flo' you'll get hit below
I got somebody I want you to get to know - ME!
Fearless like Jack the Ripper
Hip-Hop needs help so I'm back to flip her
Flip and run 'em back cause I'm back to stick her
And throw up on the track like it's full of li-QUOR!

[Chorus: Ludacris]
You're feelin kinda warm, like you was havin (sex)
You're wetter than a storm, like you was taxin (X)
Your mood intensifies, it's time for a surprise
So baby close your eyes, are you ready for what's (next?)

[Ludacris]
You lookin at rap's most consistant
Man, whatever they cain't do I can
What they wanna be in the future, I am
A hip-hop mogul's right where I stannnnd
God damn I'm good!
Stretchin out the limits of music, I should
Do it like I know and how only I could
Do it like a pro and how only I woullllld
Still I'm lookin for some girls gone willllld (gone willlld)
I'm just tryin to make these girls all smilllle (all smilllle)
And I'm gonna pour Patron, 'til I
Get 'em in the zone, then I'll
Get 'em all alone, 'til I
Make 'em wanna bone, then I'll
Take 'em to a level that they mighta never been befo'
We gon' hit the do' and then hit the flo' you'll get hit below
I got somebody I want you to get to know - ME!
L-U to the D-A-C
To the R-I-S and yeah that's me
A gift to read minds, got E.S.P.
Hottest thing on the go since PSP's

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Wow, MC's I bake 'em
Put me in a circle of homies and I'ma break 'em
Mighta took your brain a minute to process
Could take the whole game a minute to top this
Just figured out that I'm ahead of my time
With a flow so fast I'm ahead of my rhyme
Your clock is off-beat, better set it to mine
With a six-year run havin a hell of a time
Cauuuuse I'm always lookin for some girls gone willllld (gone willlld)
I'm just tryin to make these girls all smilllle (all smilllle)
And I'm gonna get 'em high, 'til I
Make 'em touch the sky, then I'll
Make 'em wonder why, why
Why am I so fly, cause I
Take 'em to a level that they mighta never been befo'
We gon' hit the do' and then hit the flo' you'll get hit below
I got somebody I want you to get to know - ME!
A millionaire with extra paper
If you haven't heard, go and ask a neighbor
I'm like hot sauce with extra flavor
So put it on your tongue for your mouth to SAVOR!

[Chorus]</pre>
