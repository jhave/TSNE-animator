[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you.. don't think about you

[Drake]
Done saying, I'm done playin', last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more, I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent, come places with star girls
End up on them front pages, I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up and like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone coming 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talking to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talking to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothing
There's issues at hand that we're not discussing
Uh, I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's acting like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess," Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself that she's too sick 
to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
All my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down, damn

[Chorus]

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me something's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted..
You care, you care..
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense..
Well if it's all a dream.. then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lying, tell me when I'm trying</pre>
