[Intro: Rick Ross] 
Self made...
Gotta handle your own... {M-M-M-Maybach Music}
{J-J-J-J-J-Just Blaze} ...I'mma handle mine

[Wale] + (Rick Ross)
They tried and tell me I don't fit up in this motha fucka
Cause Rozay been talkin white he think he Uncle Ruckus (HUH)
I left Jimmy, they was spending silly with my budget
And now I'm rolling with some cooler niggas I can fuck with (HUH)
You by the cooler yea you niggas don't get no tick
Bitch I think I'm Teen Wolf, a dog nigga, ballin' bitch (HUH)
Fly as Ricky steam boat, me and my Moschino
I dont wear no 501's: 1000 dollar jeans flow (WHOO)
It's funny how Pucci made all the snakes gone (WHOO)
I'm winning cause Ricky made my mistakes known (WHOO)
Its funny that since I put this chain on
These bitches appear quicker than state farm
Wale Folarin somethin they can't ever smoke
Weed I can't pronounce man this shit would leave Rosetta stoned
This man can single handedly save the culture (HUH)
You got no spark you need some lighter man you Sammy Sosa
So get it right ok you ballin and I'm with the owners
You know my drive is retarded like I'm riding doughnuts
Picture me rollin': young, handsome and focused
Got that vision of Pac and though my branding is Oprah
Michelangelo portrait meet Maya Angelou notebook
Michael Jordan performance nigga I dream to be all of it (WHOO)
Yea, I'm just a poet with some hangtime
I dont really shakespeare, I just shake dice (HUH)
Miami nights, made a couple grand (right)
Private plane TSA can kiss my ass (haha)
Lord forgive me I'm trying, know I ain't living right (HUH)
But this card I'm trickin' with got no limit right
In this life you dead wrong or ain't living right
They on my ass like a center make them take a hike

[Meek Mill] + (Rick Ross)
(All we wanted was opportunity; Lord knows~!)
It's MMG baby - the dream team (better believe)

Uh, I made it myself, guess I'm self made (HUH)
Fire starter put me anywhere I just blaze
Dropped out of school never made it to the 12th grade
I'm so fucking raw haters hoping that I catch AIDS (WHOO)
Motivated just from being broke (WHOO)
Had a dream like Martin Luther, little bit of hope
If Rosa never rolled and Malcolm never spoke
They'd probably find me in the woods hanging from a rope
Instead they lock me in the cell just for sellin dope
When people used to ask if I was high, I would tell them no
Cause I was never hesitant to represent
Devil knocking at the door screaming let me in
Tell the owner hit the lights when we stepping in
Charlie Sheen on them haters, they dont wanna let me win
Nah, niggas they dont wanna let me win
But I'mma build it ground up, (let's again)
I kill these rappers early in the game, abortion
Spit a verse like lemme get ya fam, extortion
Send these niggas back to when they came, deportion
Make'm forefeit and I'm porshin 600 horses
911, somebody call 'em
Kemba Walker cross em over, somebody fallin
Jump back, I hit the shot, somebody ballin
I'm at the dealer and I hear that Maserati callin
Black and white diamonds looking like my neck be vollyballin
And this presi lookin like somebody pottied on it
I don't gotta join illuminati just to get a new Bugatti
I'm just ridin I done put a thousand miles on my body

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Born to win - look around
From the projects to the penthouse
Our vision never changed, we self made
Count that up - HUH~!

[Pill] + (Rick Ross)
Hah, self made self paid man
P-I double L in the building
(ATL) Go on and get yo muthafuckin roll on...

8 in the morning when that street clock bust: kitchen overload
Door knob turns; the aisle burn baking soda pourin'
The clientele buy and sell like a pawn shop
Profit margings increase, exit the V wit my gun out
Out witted, out foxed you over matched
House hidden, drop tops the sofas match
This is fine dine take out, first date make out
Diamonds blind the lens and camera men on the stakeout
As I enter the steak house pockets on humongo
Philosphical drama and wildin known as the congo?
Africana, Black as Ghana, be my attire
Mary water, marajuana that stick to get higher?
We blow stress through the vents of the Marriott (HUH)
We self made, carry on while we carry out

[Outro: Rick Ross]
If I woke up tomorrow and didn't have a dolla..
As long as I have my heart, I can get it all over
Dream team - we the '93 Chicago Bulls baby
The lovely Teedra Moses, self made...
