Artist: Sudden Death
Album:  Dead Things Can Rap Too
Song:   Thump Music
Typed by: www.suddendeath.org

Now what if rappers had to write their own music
Instead of getting sampled stuff so they could use it
Over a beat that's nothing but a bass drum
Over and over making your ears numb
This is what happens when you sell out
Can't take the pressure so you're gonna have to bail out
Find a good beat so your song hits big
Then use it over and over at the gig
Bounce up and down to the thump of the drum
Pay no regard that the lyrics are dumb
Dance at a club that smells like a dump
You just can't avoid it, go to a club all you hear is..

[Chorus]
Thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump
Thump thump thump thump

Writin' a hit nowadays is easy
Write about sex, but don't make it sleazy
It doesn't matter if it comes out corny
America won't admit it but it's horny
Any kind of new cross-over will work
Even if the M.C. sounds like a jerk
All the real rappers don't get any airplay
The public doesn't wanna hear what they have to say
all they wanna hear is..

[Chorus]

Rap a couple lines and then sing
At every dance club it's the exact same thing
I'm gettin' sick of everybody sellin' out
'Cause they don't understand what the music's all about
Turn on the radio and thump in your car
Thump musicians think they're gonna go far
But I hope the thump fad doesn't stick, 'cause I'm tellin' you
I'm really gettin' sick of hearin' nothing on a beat but a..

[Chorus]
