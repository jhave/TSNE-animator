[Intro: Yung Joc] + (Ms. B)
Eenie, meeny, miney, moe
How many bitches from the club want go
I knowwww you see it; I knowwww you see it
(I'm like eenie, meeny, miney, moe)
(How many niggaz in the club want go)
(I knowwww you see it; I knowwww you see it)

[Yung Joc]
Now you can call me tip drill, they playin my songs
Throw a couple ones, then she throw away her thongs
When she bust it open, take a picture with my phone
She love my cologne, call it perk body zone
Now she pussy poppin, yeah it's goin down
Slap the waitress on the booty, tell her get another round
And when I make it rain, money all over the ground
Fresh Force Ones, Sean John buttoned down
And then I'm like, "Ohh, boy, my click full of stars"
Big fo'-fifth, big dick and big cars
At the end of the day when it's all said and done
I'ma need fo' freaks, cause I need more than one

[Chorus 1: Yung Joc]
Eenie, meeny, miney, moe
How many bitches from the club want go
I knowwww you see it (I know you see it)
I knowwww you see it (I know you see it)
I'm like bim (bim) bam (bam) I know you want some (some)
She chewin on the dick like a piece of Bubble Yum
I knowwww you see it (I know you see it)
I knowwww you see it (I know you see it)

[Chorus 2: Ms. B]
I'm like eenie, meeny, miney, moe
How many niggaz in the club want go
I knowwww you see it (I know you see it)
I knowwww you see it (I know you see it)
Then I'm like dim (dim) damn (damn) I know you want some (some)
You chewin on the pussy like a piece of Bubble Yum
I knowwww you see it (I know you see it)
I knowwww you see it (I know you see it)

[Ms. B]
I ain't never been the type to show off in the club
Real laid back, poppin plenty bottles of
Bub, don't smoke but I got much perk
Get that nigga real high, make him slurp it then burp
Could you be a groupie? I hear you singin my song
Like I see you, lemme feel yo' tongue
It's me, Ms. B, nigga let me get you laced
Take a step back, blow the pussy in your face
I ain't talkin kush nigga, talkin the rat race
So many to choose from, give 'em all a lil' taste
Got a house full of pussy, the madame of hip-hop
My bitches are superstars, so gushy you need a mop; yeahhh

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Yung Joc]
I got stacks on deck, snowflakes on my neck
New J's on my feet, make my outfit complete
I knowwww you see it - I knowwww you see it

[Ms. B]
I got stacks on deck, niggaz love my flow
Got a mohawk blowin, Urr Forces that glow
I knowwww you see it - I knowwww you see it

[Chorus 1]
