Walkin down the street and I'm clenchin my fists
I'm waitin for a punk bitch to even start talkin shit
Not today please man I'm not in the mood
Don't even fuck with me I got a bad attitude
Truth down the ave see a punk wanna beef
Fake thug lookin hard can't be over 15
He's lookin mean staring at me wearin thug dress
Wearin a wife beater when he barely ways a buck wet
Man what you lookin at I'm iller than you
And I've eaten fuckin steaks that were bigger than you
So get the fuck out of my grill I'm mentally ill
I wanna "murder murder murder and kill kill kill"
Walked over to him grabbed a spoon out of my pocket
Gouged out his eyes and I scalped off the sockets
Busted a nut and sprayed it all in his brain
Snapped off his head and attatched it to a chain
And I swung it around and beat a bystander with it
I'm wicked I took his fuckin ear and I bit it
Off and spit it in the face of a midget
I should be commited I don't care man I admit it
I just dont know how to cope
When I had a bad day so peep that song that I wrote
I choke your throat and drill holes in your head
Just because I woke up on the wrong side of the bed

Pissed
Dont fuck with me today cause I'm
Pissed
I might just break your face if I'm
Pissed
Too much stress buildin up cause I'm
Pissed pissed shit bitch - (repeat 3X)</pre>
