Typed by: r_alam@hotmail.com

So what you doing
I'm feeling very well
Rocking this from Brooklyn, this is my vibration
Make you have sensation, when you hear the jam
All you want to say is happiness yo

Sometimes I get a feeling inside it's like (what)
It's something type of hard to explain it's like (what)
I got a good vocab and such but Ock
Somethings still remain out of touch- it's like
Your very first kiss or- it's like
Like a new pair of kicks or
You know what I'm saying Ock
It's just the vide
I can't articulate it
It's better demonstrated
And when it's integrated
Then things get rennovated
It's deeply contemplated
Before I operated
My steady advance will keep the jams populated

Okay okay I'm ready, (alright) I'm feeling good
Beats by 88 Key, Mos Def the emcee
The HOTtest entry, inside your benzy
Yo they got digitals now, true
That's old school
Don't run no new game, I like the old rules- like
Early to sleep and early to wake
You keep your long on money and short on mistakes
I speak on beat breaks, my jams is keep sakes
So recite that (cite that)
I said recite that (CITE that)
Cause when I'm laying down here baby it's tight phat
When I react that ain't no army that can strike back
And if they do they catching more than the eye jab (poof)
A lot of cats like to bite, I copyright that
So when you hear it on your box you say "I like that"
Send salaams to Abstract, is this the right track?
We staying, underground like the NTA
Be controller of the rock like the NBA
I remember days when supper was the empty tray
But I still held it down for mines an-y-way
See I still held it down for mines an-y-way
See I still held it down for mines an-y-way

It's how we do say,
Hey man what you doing
Feeling very well
Rocking this from Brooklyn
This is my vibration
To make you have sensation
Family situation
When you hear the jam
All you want to say, is Happiness- yo

The era we entering is mad exciting
Sometimes I got more rhymes than I remember writing
I stand like a titan above the mental midget
My safe originate from seven-eighteen digits
Thats BROOKLYN- for area code impaired
Medina of the planet for cats from out there
Mos Def official native of the Bed-Stuy section
I'm standing 5'10" with the chocolate complextion
I keep the function moving in the right direction
I'm coming with the new to keep the next crew guessing
Who you stressing!  Pump your brakes and slow down
I hold court, you get cut short like pronoun
I throw down just like Ali in Zyaire
I'm fresh from my feet to the roots in my hair
Kangol and Wallabees is some gear that I wear
Skid out to Chamber Street and I copped the fly pair
And I DARE- anyone of these new chaps
To step in the arena without they crew's back
Approahing the recital with titles you lose that
Send home a telegram to relay the news that the
M- for magnificant
O- praise omnipotent
S- for significant
D- for type different
E- for effic-ient
F- the fly fisherman
Netting everything from here to Lake Michigan
So all my people if you're out there listening
Give me a shout and let me know what you getting in
Some emcees ain't even worth mentioning
Let's congregate and compilate these Benjamins
We take the crown and break them down like divis-ion
To realize what my eyes is envisioning
Dollars correct and I'm the man on deck
But otherwise I gotta jet, it's no disrespect
Otherwise I gotta jet, it's no disrespect
Otherwise I gotta jet, it's no disrespect
Otherwise I gotta jet, it's no disrespect

Hey man what you doing
Feeling very well
Rocking this from Brooklyn
This is my vibration
To make you have sensation
Family situation
When you hear the jam
All you want to say, is Happiness</pre>
