[Lil Rob]
(Verse 1)
Up in the mornin' and out to school
The teacher is teaching the golden rule
American history and practical math
You studying hard and hopin' to pass
Working your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone

(Verse 2)
Ring, ring, goes the bell
The cook in the lunch room's ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom, open your books
Keep up the teacher, don't know how mean she looks

(Verse 3)
As soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Close up your books, get out of your seat
Down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and round the bend
Right to the juke joint, you go in

(Verse 4)
Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear somethin' that's really hot
With the one you love, you're making romance
All day long, you been wantin' to dance
Feeling the music from head to toe
Round and round and round, we go

[20 seconds of instrumental]

Repeat Verse 4

(Verse 5)
Hail, hail rock and roll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rock and roll
The beat of the drums, loud and bold
Rock, rock, rock and roll
The feeling is there, body and soul</pre>
