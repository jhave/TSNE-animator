[Lone Ninja]
War paint on the game face so I'm ready for action
Behold the deadly assassin steady attacking 		
Buried your faction it's death when I prowl
You're clearly a has been so step aside now		
I'm no doubt the naughtiest get your mug slapped
I come out victorious in the grudge match  	
Ninja comes back with eye of the tiger
The hired sniper will strike no sight of survivors  	
Blaze inside the section with laser guided weapon
I slay the spy and raid with high aggression 
My blade is life threatening I creep through the orchard
I'm evil, a stalker a lethal enforcer		
I strike and you're wobbled You frightened and grovel              
I hide hidden with night vision goggles 	
You titans get toppled foes will fear wrath
Assault with tear gas or choke with bare hands	
Gross torture wont warn ya, sword is sharp
foes slaughtered at close quarters, forward march	
Spit on the corpses of my slain enemies
Villianous, lawless, and I plague terribly  	 


[Lone Ninja]
Viciously slash with blade give me the accolade
It's misery the grizzly will smash his prey 	
Come brawl with the brute I'll war with your troops
No stalling my foes calling, for truce  	
Applaud and salute don't play round the sargeant
No warning I'll shoot to takedown the target	
You'll breakdown in hardship I'm violent and hate all
Spray rounds with harshness the privates will AWOL		
Enter the savagery it's at your own risk
Attack your center of gravity I clash ferocious		
Blast and won't miss you're nailed, by sharpshooter
Braggadocious assail, the dark troopers	
Injure the brigadier the ninja will disappear
The winner and victor the killer will trigger fear	
You scared, scram and flee my humble condolence
Through air, land, and sea I pummel opponents	 
Let you bleed you maggot, ie in your tomb
The enemy combatant, will die of his wounds	
It's violence and doom you're playing russian roulette
You aint want it who next I'm plain rugged, you bet	
Red alert your dealt with as you cross the line
You getting hurt I'm hellish, have you lost your mind	
A beast an animal the ninja will slaughter
The fleet admiral is giving an order		

[Lone Ninja]
You wanna grapple let's duel at dawn, I'm in the battle dress uniform
The rascal's vex cowards get bruised and torned 		
You humans warned hark the war angel
My darts are more painful martyrs are strangled		     
You'll moan in the boot camp trifle soldier
Lone is a true champ title holder			
Slay and demolish the foes in carrier
Grenades and the rockets explode the barrier			
Beat your field marshal black and blue
Shurikens still harmful bash and bruise			
You're trapped in burnt sector there's no return
I have the worst temper you'll roast and burn		
Surrounding barbed wires cut through your skin
A loud barrage fired you struggle to win		
You're pummeled and pinned sinister rivals know
The scuffle is grim deliver final blow			
You're dropped from choplifter rot with the locked 
Prisoners you're watching the clock ticker			
Beligerent and on the attack
The militant will swarm the barracks 		 
Quickly disarming killers I'm taking the lead
Like Viet Cong guerrillas I wait in the trees		
Blood'll splash battle opponents infantry
The muzzle flash travel the road to victory
