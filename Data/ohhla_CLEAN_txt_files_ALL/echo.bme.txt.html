Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
Oh, around, the world, there's an echo
As, he takes, a bow, and they all know
All the girls, the boys, they chase, the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echooooo...

[Interlude: Eminem] + (Royce)
Sometimes no matter what I do
Just can't get away from it
(Get away from what?) The voices
I can hear 'em calling calling calling calling calling me

[Eminem]
I EAT rappers, with the rhyme, consume 'em
The only fuckin thing that you consume is time, I'm super human
My world is like a Rubik's Cube, it's too complex, girl you assumin
Cupid's loomin, my mentality's caveman, stupid woman
My life is Truman Show, all I have is music hoe
I stopped chasin every chick under the sun many moons ago 
so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
But you better put a fork in it if you think I'ma lay here just spoonin yo
Oh you think you the shit cause I just said you was BEAUTIFUL?!
Diabolical to my last molecule down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
Rotten to the core to the bone cold all the way down to my soul from my head to my toe
Ever since I was 13 I learned how to sew and sewed shut my own booty hole
Cause ain't I took no shit since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'ma set this bitch on FIRE
And this time I don't mean I'ma pour gasoline on some chick and light her
Cause this time when I fuck this world I'ma put the whole Goddamn dick inside her
I ain't even put my tip in that hole yet, I'ma go get Nickel and try to rip it wider

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Royce] + (Eminem)
Shh! Wait, did you hear that?
Somebody just said somethin
Is anybody there?
(I can hear 'em calling calling calling calling calling me)

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Classical poems, battle my own demons, I need a glass of Patrón
Bad as I need a horn stabbin my clavicle bone, I'm matador prone
First time I seen a Desert Eagle I was lettin the fo'-fo' bust, the fo'-fo' pop
First time you seen one you was eatin Cocoa Puffs, lookin at RoboCop
I am not a man I'm a logo, I'm a such thang
In order to clean my veins you need saline/Saleen
I'm never referrin to the solution, I'm talkin about more like the Mustang
Vroom! Get respect from the get-go, HELLO~! Step to the echo (echo)
Pen got a mind of its own
Gotta write my rhymes with a timer, otherwise I'll probably vibe out to a 9-minute song
As the echo follows the Maserati as it petrol swallows
I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton
Check yo' Bible, inside it it'll say this guy's an elephant
I'm, fly like I'm, killin the scene like I'm, a villain with wings
I'll sleep when I'm six feet deep, right now I'm livin a dream (dream!)
Though we may be reckless, the ladies check us
They whisper - Shady Records; BABY ECHO~!
