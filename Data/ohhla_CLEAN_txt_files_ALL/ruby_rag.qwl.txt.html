Please doctors don't worry, not that Ruby liked to be burned
She truly was the dreamer, mommy's secret singer
Would just rarely let a lover beat her
Lest she had it coming
Well, once or threece maybe, that's it
But who's something
Daddy used to hum it with a smile on
But never with the lights on, long nights just numbin
Slutty perfume, and ruined pork roast, soaked wardrobe
Scars
Ruby grew up with bubble gum cheeks runnin
Streets
Sweet child, steep summit
Plummet, pink tile and all (Tylenol) a weak stomach
The driest eyeball, waterfall calm, dream caught, night crawlin, subtle "aw nothing"
The humming birds sang they saw nothing
But soft rain hanging from the plumbing
Flooding from her grimace
Image hiding in this furnace
Soul soakin in the summer like it's breaking in her sunburn
Monsters in her road home, she knows them by their number
Her daughter named her mother, she was weeping drunken tangos
Sunken under vanity table, in shrunken angles
Rusty angels fuckin with my day dream, the chuckling stain sings
The drain chokes, the day goes on
But not a day goes by
That she don't sing those songs
So the day you fly is the day I died
Today I die

Dear weeping Ruby, tears streaking cheek bones
He moans, he remembers everything, singin three feet of sea foam
It's getting deeper Ruby, we failed you as your brothers
Your genesis was a whisper
But exodus like thunder
And ever since the summer I died
I've been under high tide
I can't take it no more
This pain wading my time
I'm weighing me down, dear Ruby
Would you mind if I hang around
Dear truly
Would you mind if I stayed and drowned
Red Ruby
Would you hate it if I painted out loud
Dear truly

Pain staking His palms He can make it along
But can't make it alone
There's strangers playin your song
Can't wait for that long, in Yah's cradling arms
The Creator of all, imperfect Ruby</pre>
