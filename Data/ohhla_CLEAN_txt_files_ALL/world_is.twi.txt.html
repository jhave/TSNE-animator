[Monoxide]
I can see him walkin into class
They are all staring and at some point a couple
motherfuckas start to laugh
They're talkin about me, but they do it to they friends
'Cause they all afraid of whats gon happen in the end
Now my ears keep ringing, only meanin that the devil sings
And prays on broken wings
I'm not a new thing, consumated out of faith
I've been assembled and created by all of the things you hate
I'm uncontrollable but still I get the last laugh
I got your presidents head inside my garbage bag
Be alarmed everybody cause the bird's out
My last warning was last year the words out
I take revenge of the american mute
And fire bomb on your campain boost from house roots
And thats the truth as only Twiztid can tell
Make sure its all covered cause the world is hell

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
The world is hell..
I'm hearin' what you sayin but your faking all that
hoping and staying as if its changing
The world is hell
But change must come from within
Speakin your mind is that another sin from within?

[Madrox]
Lets begin with the way that we act (death and destruction!)
Taking lives with an axe, killing is a function
Taught by the world then embedded in the mind
That through television to the age of 9 is solictified
Little time bombs just waiting to explode
On the whole world turning the world into a hole
And its your fault, so many young are dumb
And turn to drugs and be like "fuck an education"
Homeless, starving, strung out, and dying
(Eating out of garbage)..Surviving
A lost generation
Stuck somewhere between the real and the mind and imagination
Some call it hell
Living life everyday, maybe this is hell?
Evils everywhere and anyway
If you're good you'll go to heaven
And if your not you'll be destined to stay alive till the year 2057

[Chorus]

[Esham]
What's the price of betrayal? Push your V-12 through Hell
Time tell if I'm nailed to a cross like Christ
Murder's on the mind of many motherfuckas at night
Stevie Wonder wouldn't wanna see the shit that's insight
The world is hell, the day the Twin Towers fell
The day the Titanic set sail, the Anthrax mail
But who you gonna tell? Nobodies listening, nitroglycerin
Pistols popping and bullet's whistling, the music's twisted
Hell of a heavenly, for ever but don't miss it
The world is hell, two blocks away from where I sleep
Now I lay me down to sleep, my soul, the angel's, they keep
The world is hell.. The world is hell

[Chorus]
