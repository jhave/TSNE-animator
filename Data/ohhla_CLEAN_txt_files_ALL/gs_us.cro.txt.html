Song:   G's Us
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
They tried to separate us G's but they never could
They tried to separate us G's but they never could
They tried to separate us G's but they never could
Boss niggas fuck with boss niggas in every hood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love
Divide and conquer is the method but it's understood
We get respect in every section that us hustlers stood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love

Hold up Crook you going to hard man
They been waiting for this for a minute

[Chorus]
They tried to separate us G's but they never could
Boss niggas fuck with boss niggas in every hood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love
Divide and conquer is the method but it's understood
We get respect in every section that us hustlers stood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love

[Verse]
Yeah, Croo let's go my nigga
Blowing smoke out the outie
My spread be smelling like mountie
Federalies on the hills that led the battles
Blowing smoke out the outie
My spread be smelling like mountie
Federalies on the hills that led the battles
Blowing smoke out the outie
My spread be smelling like mountie
Federalies on the hills that led the battles
Stray the dames, great capillaries
Caress fatties, piggy ray canary
Cuban lane Miami
Virgin Mary turn a purple caddy
Gary sweet callin' purple candy
Talking bird out of the panties
Swallow brandy, I fly to where Sandy
You lay south up in your camp
Be like glam me
Old hammer blammer AT, melt some,
Cans, a bottle of wine, I set the belt buckles
The bare I hustle, had the snout lustful
Blow the spot like a mushroom
And takin' the truck fumes
I taste the crushed food, drink a cup full
Display the Jacob on the cuff too
My gain is plush blue, my waste day on a bus rule
My butt laying in a plush coupe, fuck you
Nigga
My butt laying in a plush coupe like fuck you

[Chorus]
They tried to separate us G's but they never could
Boss niggas fuck with boss niggas in every hood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love
Divide and conquer is the method but it's understood
We get respect in every section that us hustlers stood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love

[Verse]
Calli niggas drive the meanest chargers
We Robin Hoods like the english archer
Pouring our liquor for the dececed departure
Tell the Grim Reaper that we his parteners
Cut the grass low, you snake niggas meet your gardners
Gun sleeping in my waist, don't awake my stainless
You interrupt his power neck, he gonna make you famous
It took a long time for the world to let me display my cadence
Like a hospital chaplain, I had to pray for patience
It's all scietific, my mind's higher lifted
I wrote note thy self in the Pyramides and hieroglyphics
I steal fire bisquits, street soldier I enlist it
I hope in your world that in 2012 don't get the mayans twisted
For metazine and vodka that's the gasoline bottle
I broke a cigar, smoke on a show magazine model
That Ferrari squat, she has a scene throttle
It cost an arm and a leg, the amputee auto
About my lutes and lieutenants want to recruit me
But generals already absolutely salutely

[Chorus]
They tried to separate us G's but they never could
Boss niggas fuck with boss niggas in every hood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love
Divide and conquer is the method but it's understood
We get respect in every section that us hustlers stood
Cause, blood, God, son, peoples, folks, thugs, love

[Outro]
It's all love
It's all love</pre>
