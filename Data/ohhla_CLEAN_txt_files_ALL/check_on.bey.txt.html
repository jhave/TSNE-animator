[Slim Thug]
You need to stop playing round with all them clowns and the wangstas
Good girls gotta get down with them gangstas
Go head girl put some back and some neck up on it
While I stand up in the background and check up on it

[Chorus]
Ohh boy you looking like you like what you see
Won't you come over check up on it, I'm gonna let you work up on it
Ladies let 'em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twork it, stop it, check on me tonight

If you got flaunt it, boy I know you want it
While I turn around you watch me check up on it
Oohhh you watchin me shake it, I see it in ya face
Ya can't take it, it's blazin, you rock me it amaze me
You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it
If you don't go braggin, I'ma let you have it
You think that I'm teasin, but I ain't got no reason
I'm sure that I can please ya, but first I gotta read you

[Chorus] - 2X

I can tell you wanna taste it, but I'm gone make you chase it
You got to be patient, I like my men patient
More patience, you take my get you in more places
You can't be abrasive, has to know to pace it
If I let you get up on it, you gotta make a promise
That you gone put it on me, like no ones put it on me
Don't bore me, just show me, all men talk but don't please
I can be a tease, but I really wanna please you

[Chorus] - 2X

[Slim Thug]
I'm checking on you boo, do what chu do
And while dance I'ma glance at this beautiful view
I'm keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue 'em w/ glue
I'm in a trance all eyes on you and your crew
Me and my mans don't dance, but to feel y'all bump and grind
If won't hurt if you gone try one time
They all hot, but let me see this ones mine
It's slim thug and DC outta H town

[Chorus]</pre>
