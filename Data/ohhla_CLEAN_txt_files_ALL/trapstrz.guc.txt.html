[Intro]
Yeah! Yeah!
Gucci Gucci, Zaytoven
Gucci Mane, familiar territory
Get it, get it, get it, believe it

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
24's on yo' car youse a trap star
If you known to buy the bar youse a trap star
You got a watch on your wrist youse a trap star
You got ice around yo' neck youse a trap star

[Gucci Mane]
I'm a G boy, I asked my homey can I hit that
D-boy, sell a hundred bricks like a big sack
Trap star, one thousand pounds of the stank stank
Grind out of town, got a stash by the gas tank
Big Cat, fronted a hundred, I bought a hundred
Now I got a lot of money, known for doin a lot of stuntin
Hood on lock, everybody shop with me
Still sell you 63 grams for the twelve-fifty
Uhh, I'm five fo' a dime
19 for the whole and it's jumpin out the bowl
Uhh, uhh, down with some K like that
Make your daddy say I never caught a train like that
Uhh, uhh, I mean top notch coke
So much dope that my scale just coated in, snow
As I talk about 'dro
We got a half a million dollars just layin on the flo'

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Man I'm ridin through the hood in a CL-6
I'm the nigga that your baby daddy re-up with
Celebrities, {?} you might see me with
But I grew so much dope that I sprung my wrist
Uhhhhhh, I ain't rappin I'm trappin
I got a thousand blue pills, I ain't talkin 'bout aspirins
Uhh, got a whole bunch of trees
And the kind we move don't got no seeds
Uhh, uhh, a couple bricks of some white stuff
{?} throw a stash in the baby diapers
Uhh, so every day is a Friday
So much weed you can smell it from the driveway
Uhh, now where the trap stars at
Probably posted in the back on the corner sellin thrax
Uhh, uhh, I'm a G from the streets
I'm a nigga from the block puttin product on the streets

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I'm the grind man, pine man, 'dro man, kind man
Po' man, die man, brick man, trap man
Trick man, snow man, big man, hit man
Dick man, slick man, cut man, Gucci man
Peal man, purp' man, lay man, weed man
Crest man, X man, better wear a vest man
Yo boy, dough boy, bow down to no boy
Never been a hoe boy, known to rock the show boy
Dough boy, glow boy, lover boy, pretty boy
City boy, country boy, never been a monkey boy
A jack boy, crack boy, dope boy, trap boy
See me in the club shawty call me throwback boy
Black boys, black toys, eatlin like the Fat Boys
Gucci on the track boy, how you love that boy?
Hot shit, top quick, now who you shop with?
Gucci is the top dick, my Gators in the closet

[Chorus]</pre>
