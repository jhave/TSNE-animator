Typed by: furness@ousd.k12.ca.us

Some don't think I can flow
So here we go 
To a new track
To show the wack
That I can throw styles that show up
I blow up and blast here
Niggas still tripping off the shit I said last year
About a bitch is bitch is a bitch is a bitch
Then I got rich but I'll never switch
So I dedicate this one to the groupie
And the Charlie all on my Snoopy
Brothers keep asking Ice Cube yo when will you bust
They surround me and make a big fuss
Now I was taught back on my block
That you don't ride on nobody's jock
For anything they do
Fuck him and his crew
Unless you were gettin paid too
I'm not saying this to dis each and every fan
Women you can ride but man be a man
Shake my hand and make it a firm shake
Say what's up Ice Cube and then break
Cause if you're hangin there I'm a tell you loud and clear
Get off my my dick nigga and tell your bitch to come here
