[Chorus] 

(Wish) 
It's an everday thang when you let your nuts hang 
My niggas they never change 
They kickin' it wit the gang and remain the same 
So follow me now see 
Up to the double glock in 
Hear pistols poppin' 
Buckin' them bodies for shots and 
Thugstas for them all and bodybags thugstas 
Niggas deal when I man my thugstas 
got to pump slugs for bustas cause I never did love ya 
Nigga my niggas will break your neck 
Nigga trying to disrepect 
Nothin' but killas and trues I rose wit 
We'll cut ya so fuck ya 
East 99 is where you'll find us chillin but nigga what's up 
Nigga want to get bugged 
Nigga want to get drugged 
Nigga really want to get fucked up 
Pump pump put them in a trunk 
Now watch them fall down to the pavement 

(Krayzie) 
My nigga just say when 
And I'm runnin' wit the pump let the gauge bang bang 
To the bang puff puff but I'm feelin' lovely 
But I need mo' bud see 
For me to slang my dummies 
I got to put em in the mission for money 
And I better run 
I'll grab my gat and flip it wit big shot guns 
When I'm gone gone strung wit me say now say now how we swang them thangs 

[Chorus]
It's an everday thang when you let your nuts hang 
My niggas they never change 
They kickin' it wit the gang and remain the same 
So follow me now see 
Up to the double glock in 
Hear pistols poppin' 
Buckin' them bodies for shots and 

Before we go bust a left better hit that liquor store h

(Layzie) 
Little Layzie's runnin wit me thugstas and hustlas 
Cause niggas we never no bustas 
Addicted to my niggas to forever in well Flesh be the bigger 
Brother with nothin' to lose forever we trues and nigga 

(Bizzy) 
Why not test the ripster comin' mo' sinister buckin me pump pump in ya 
All of my niggas bang bang 
Kickin in the thang so swang slang and 
We won't be buckin real low really doe 
Cause I'm on wit bang brain 

(Flesh) 
Pap pap stay strapped and again I'm coming to let my lead off 
Ready to roll and I shook his head off 
And when I get done I'm going to blow your head off they lost 
Forever that fifth dog nigga dat all be nailin' 'em all 

(Layzie) 
Y'all fall down from the ball
checkin' out them draws hangin' them balls in Cleveland 
Watchin' my back when I'm runnin through my city 
Cause nigga it aint the same 
Gotta get dank but I smoke and maintain 
Man we crept and we came doing everyday thangs 
And I won't get caught up brought up 
Outta the cut wit sawed off sawed up 
Nigga that brought that pap pap 

(Flesh) 
Every time wit gal up yall up started 
This page but I can't escape my ways 

(Flesh) 
Holdin the gauge on the raid he slayed 
rip this slit right back in the days 
Yes Flesh put 'em to rest, let's test 
Feelin' the pain runnin this gang insane 
To the brain runnin' the same stuff it's an everyday thang 


It's an everyday thang when you let your nuts hang 
[Buckin' them bodies with shots] 
It's an everyday thang when you let your nuts hang 
[Buckin' them bodies with shots] 
It's an everyday thang when you let your nuts hang 
[Buckin' them bodies with shots] 
It's an everyday thang when you let your nuts hang 
[Buckin' them bodies with shots]
