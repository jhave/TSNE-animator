[Bad Azz]
Yeah, come on
Bad Azz is here
Come on
All year
Mister 2000
All year
Millenium music
Mister 21st Century

Its like race car lights
Its just like shakin the dice
Just pray for your life ain't always makin it right
I'm safe in the light
The subjects to the dangers of all
They aimin at cha'll
And we the ones mostly involved
Its most of y'all
Trust me, they don't know me to ball
See the truth is I don't feel they owe me at all
The focus is small
A nigga either broke or he ball
And me, I smoke til I choke and I cough, drink til I barf
Sometimes I ain't thinkin at all
But I don't pray to take my eyes of y'all
These streets don't brawl
(stick 'em up!)
Don't nobody hesitate to drop a body 
Karate can't do nothing to me
I got a shawty if anybody need to penetrate 'em
Now you can die while in the streetz of illustrated
This world was given to me I went here to make it
Now you gon relate to this, or you either hatin

[Hook: Ice Cube]
(Bad Azz)
We be in 'em streetz, every single day
We be in 'em streetz, every single day 
We be in 'em streetz, every single day
(See we just write about it, but you can die about it)
We be in 'em streetz, every single day
(Now you can be a C about it nigga G about it)

[Ice Cube]
Lyrical Rembrant
Spend that
Nigga we put that Henn that
Since 14 been makin green where you wanna go and spend that?
I grin that, HOES
Now I'm all up in that
Bout 15 min-at
Car done Luitenant
Me and Bad Azz is makin that dash
Smokin that hash
Spendin the cash
If they ask
Willin to mash
When we pass we gon blast
Who gon last this aftermath?
Who gon rock shit after that?
Comin from a gang bang habitat
Nigga can't even have that
Motherfucker didn't even have a gat
Who the fuck do you think we laughin at?
Youse a bitch, youse a snitch, youse the nigga that I have to jack
I'm the man, gat in hand, didn't think that I'd have to pack
But I do, fuckin you, hows your life, can't have it back

Streetz illustrated, nigga

[Bad Azz]
Its that West Coast slug, that crip shit 
That thuggin heavy with yo head to get yo grip quick
We here to claim our own gold daytonas
To slide through in the lak with the ray chrome on 'em
Jump to it, and I ain't never gotta, bounce back
I count stacks
Just cop with me and ounce sack
Announce back
You big mouth hater, you, we hit back
We got slugs in exchange for you
You underminded, we a keep ya here and change the truth
If you can find us we got drugs in exchange for lute
The cops got pictures of our mugs and our gangsta suits
Traffic ain't shit ta niggas like us with a 20 proof
We make it really hot
And those that really cops
Somebody that really shot
See how much you really got
The streetz'll eat you up
If they don't catch you first and beat you up
Nigga the little kids'll eat you up!
