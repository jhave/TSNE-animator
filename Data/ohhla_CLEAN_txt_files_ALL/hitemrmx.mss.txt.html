Verse One: Lil' Kim

Missy (B.I.G.), uhh (hah hah) yeah I like dat
Uhh, it's the Q to tha B to tha double E spittin' lovely
And it don't stop, rocks shine through my tank top
Where your bank stop?, I deposit all of one drop (hah)
Thank not, exscuse me but uh I like to flow cause this
Joint knocks harder then Indica and
I be off the wall like The Lox
Night box filled with Benjamins (woo)
Me and my girl Missy gettin' pissy up in Benigans
Makin' all you other rappers begin again, like Finnigan
Christians repent then sin again (woo)
Girls wanna be my friend again
Lay up in my crib-o-wit', get up in my limousine
While 'Misdemeanor' hit notes like Sarafina
I subpeona you to my funk room see
I hit you wit' da huhhh, she wit' you wit' da hee

Verse Two: Missy

You're not good enough to satisfy me (uh huh, can't satisfy me)
Even with yo cars and all the fly whips, I won't trip (uhh)
Cause I got many guys that wanna buy me (uh huh)
French cuts for my wrists to keep me hooked smooth out and dip
I keep hittin'

Chorus

I hit 'em wit' da hee (I hit 'em wit' da hee)
[Hit 'em wit' da hee]
I hit 'em wit' da haa
[This ones for you and me]
This for you and me
Play it in your cars (play it in yo car)

Verse Three: Missy

Just cause you cash a check and put in in da bank (uh huh)
That don't make me want to go out and sleep wit' you (nah nah)
I got my own ride and gas in da tank (uh huh)
Thanks, but no thanks, I won't be needin' you
I hit 'em wit' da

Chorus

I hit 'em wit' da hee
[Hit 'em wit' da hee]
I hit 'em wit' da haa
This for you and me
[For you and me, for you and me]
Play it in your cars (play it in yo car)

Verse Four: Mocha

Uh yo uh yo, it be me
M-O, on the M-I-C
Repin' N.Y.C., the true V.I.P.
And I can't see nobody, who can come this real
Get it done this real, gettin' love this real
Niggas love this feel, gimme a Dutch to peel
Moc-ha takin' ov-er, cause I'm so ill
Got used to talkin' shit, they not witnessin' it
And while I'm spittin' like this
Check what I'm hittin' 'em wit'

Bridge

Hee haa
Hee haa
Hee haa
(I hit 'em wit' da ha)
Hee haa
Hee haa
Hee haa
(I hit 'em with' da hee)

Chorus

I hit 'em wit' da hee
I hit 'em wit' da haa
[This is for you and me]
This for you and me (this for you and me)
Play it in your cars (play it in yo car)

Verse Five: Missy

I'm comin' around the corna corna
You think you tough, well let me see what you wonna wonna
Cause on the mic I get it hot like Datoyna don't I
I get the party jumpin' from 5 in the mornin'
You wanna bumble wit' da Bee then let me see call her
You wanna be a big balla, big spend-aholic
I get the feeling that you tryin' to impress me
One two one three, hit you wit' da hee
Hee hee hee hee hee hee
