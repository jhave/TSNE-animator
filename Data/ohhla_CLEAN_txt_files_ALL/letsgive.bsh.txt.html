[Nate G]
Baby, whenever you need a friend
When you get a little lonely
I'll be there 'til the end
You can always depend on me baby

You can call me up at night
Any time it's alright (let's give love)
Let's give love a chance for romance
and I promise I'll never break your heart again
(And I'll promise to never break your heart again)
My line, my line is never busy baby
Just call...
Whenever you want me (whenever you want me)
Whenever you need me baby (whenever you need me)
I am always there (just call)
That's all you got to do, ohh-hoh
My line, my line is never busy (never too busy babe)
Just call...
When tears are streamin down your lovin face
Ohhhh, ohhhhhhh babe
My line is never busy baby, you can always call me yeah
You don't have to be afraid of nothin, ohhh-hohhh
Baby I'm here for you
I don't know what to do, without you
It's all about you babyyyyyyyyy, yeahhhhh
