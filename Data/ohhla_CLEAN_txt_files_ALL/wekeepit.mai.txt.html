[Intro: Sample courtesy of "Let Me Clear My Throat" by DJ Kool]
Here we go now!!! Here we go now!!! Here we go now!!! Here we go!!! Here we go!!!
Here we go now!!! Here we go now!!! Here we go now!!! Here we go!!! Here we go!!!

[Chorus] (Maino)
New York City, knows how to party 
In New York City, they know how to party 
New York City (Yeah Yeah!!!) we be rockin (Welcome to New York!!!)
The apple that's rotten (You're all welcome) they keep it rockin (Uh! MAINO!!!!!)

[Verse One: Maino] (Ladies in the background)
Roll up in the club like BOW!!!!
We 'gon need our bottles right now...now...now
We 'gon make a toast to the town
Drinks in the air go shorty (Owwwwwwwww!!!)
Welcome to my city see the bright lights
Diamonds on my wrists, bright lights
The fast cars, the hot girls, the night life
The blue Yankee to the back, the white Nike's
Sippin Tequila with divas
I can't stand, I'm too drunk, Jesus!!!
People outta town call me Brooklyn
'Cause they know how I keep it, Brooklyn

[Chorus] (Swizz Beatz)
New York City, knows how to party 
In New York City, they know how to party 
New York City, we be rockin 
The apple that's rotten (OH!!!) they keep it rockin
(Can't have no party without Showtime!!!)

[Verse Two: Swizz Beatz]
Swizzy Blanco from the Bronx yo (DAMN)
See me in my Aston I'm movin real slow
Boston Road to Dyer Ave
Y'all niggas would die for the life I have
I'm the one to make the artists blow
(*Takes a breath*) Nintendo
Smoke indo then go to party mode
Put your hands up then just go retarded though
DAMN!!!  I got the beats to make the ground shake
(*Explosion*) Earthquake
I do it for the empire 'cause I been fire
You ain't never seen a monster like me, you a liar

[Verse Three: Jim Jones]
Uh, soon as I step on the scene, you hear the bitches screamin (JONES!)
I'm lookin like money, stick-up kids schemin (Word!)
Spent 40 on the watch, keep the wrist gleamin
I'm in the hood in the drop, got the whip leanin
In Harlem, when I talk, it's like car speakin (eh-HEH)
Listen close lil' mama, that's the car speakin (Chill ma)
Vampire life, I hear ya heart beatin (WHOO!)
Better chill lil' nigga 'fore I start Tweetin (Word!)
Huh! GRR~!! And you can catch me at my Sac-town
Or in the Ghost with the Bronx as the background
Y-O F-D-R, head 'em back down
I got homies in the jungle that will clap down

[Chorus] (Jadakiss)
New York City (EH HEH!!!) knows how to party (Uh huh, yeah) 
In New York City (Uh huh, yeah) they know how to party (UNSTOPPABLE!!) 
New York City (Uh huh, yeah) we be rockin (Uh huh) 
The apple that's rotten (EH HEH!!!) they keep it rockin (Uh! Yeah! Yo!)

[Verse Four: Jadakiss]
Take a trip Up Top, they turnin niggas to mincemeat
It's on soon as you cross 110th Street
Yeah, you see poverty at its best
If we ain't in the front of the lobby we on the steps
Yep! A hundred deep in the V-I 
Feel the floor shake when they start playin B-I
Razors in the mouth, the shotguns is knee high
Some of us rock True, some of us rock Levi's
HA!!! But we all rock Polo
Don't matter what borough, NY is the logo
Talkin to the Po Po's a no no
That should be a rule that's global (Uh huh)

[Verse Five: Joell Ortiz]
Uhh, you know they had to put the papi on it
Like my fans when I crowd dive I'ma catch a body on it
Leopold scope shotty on it
I'm the hardest right now, I'll put my project library on it
Pun gone, I'm the new Puerto Rico guy
They basura, don't want it with the B-O-I
Your rap image mad gimmick, me no lie
I just go all out like Margarito eye
Yaowa! That's the call of my army
We'll turn your face to a dancehall like Serani's
But nah, this a party
I got a lil' change but ain't change so send over a bottle of Bacardi

[Chorus] 
New York City, knows how to party  
In New York City, they know how to party  
New York City, we be rockin  
The apple that's rotten, they keep it rockin</pre>
