Typed by: AZ Lyrics

A great friend of mine, Michael Chavarria, introduced me to J Dilla...
the very last words he ever said to me was... "You are ready."

[Ronald Reagan speech]
"You and I have a rendezvous with destiny
We'll preserve for our children this
the last best hope of man on earth
or we'll sentence them to take the last step
into a thousand years of darkness."

I overheard niggas sayin' Jay was on the verge
He could make Rumsfeld resign with rhymes he never heard
Commune with the birds
And could manipulate matter with the usage of words
While you was blowin' X amount of dollars on a bracelet
The sovereign nation of France was opening their files on the UFO phenomenon
I.E., spaceships
It's just the facts, Jack, may as well face it
Every rhyme I write a seal get cracked from the chapter of Revelations
A atom get cracked in the blackness of meditation
Mysterious shit
Call me Jay Dogon, I'm on some serious shit
Scholars wonder "Why do he bust?"
Allah blessed me with the Midas-y touch
Everything I lay hands turn to Ethiopian gold, shiny and buffed
I got a firm understanding on the minus and plus
So I ain't got time to argue with a rapper
'bout how he ain't got rhymes that's fuckin' with mine
I'm trying to kill Lucifer
So if I have to break cause a rapper in my face tellin' me that he's the great
You can bet a shiny nickel I'll blast his muthafuckin' ass way past Jupiter
Couldn't be stupider
Fuckin' with the nuclear
Mayan, Aztec lion, Asiatic black man from Zion
Quetzalcoatl supreme, lettin' off steam
Dimethyltryptamine make a man dream
But y'all would much rather hear me rappin' 'bout trash
The size of Erykah's ass
Blunts and cash
We need saving
Minds are consumed with swine
We need bathing
Go home, fast for three days, and reflect ...
