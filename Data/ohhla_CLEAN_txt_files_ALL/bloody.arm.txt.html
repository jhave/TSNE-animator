AOTP shit nigga
Die, die, die,
Die motherfucker die

[Verse 1: Planetary]
Top Gun of this rap shit
Cock guns to blast shit, nigga what's the meaning of that
Shit's scheming to blast a smith and westin' was hood
I'm grown, now I gotta start protecting my goods
I gotta start protecting every one of my kids
I gotta start protecting everything I got in the crib (That's my shit)
I gotta have a fresh pair J's for the whizz 
If not trees, if not that i ain't handle my bizz 
A screwed up way to live
But that's me, follow my lead it is what it is (my niggaz)
I hold steel in the hour of chaos
And hurdle through the base heads tryin' to just play with the odds 
I'm not the type of nigga to claim god 
But dog i heard you spit 
Do't quit your day job
I've always been the cat to slave hard
Hoping that the dealer don't turn over the face card

[Verse 2: Doap Nixon]
Fuck the claps and cheers, all we want is respect
And ya'll fuckers are wild lame, yall aint nothing to sweat, UH
Still certified greens and tan trees
Still in the hood like damp leaves and banshees
The last time they seen Vinnie Paz and Kenny spaz
We was blazed up in a cab, waving a semi-mag
That was the time I dropped out of college
The god of law thought he would go on his own
Is still knowledge, knowledge
Kinda ridiculous the way i get in this shit
Some felt ignorant, me felt innocent
So for now on my gods you now strong
Niggas want war I get you murked by a wild ???
The only reason I ain't on and my niggas is on
Is cuz I got stuck on the gold pot that i'm sitting on
Till I seen there wasn't nothing there
From my eyes to me ears I got stains and bloody tears

[Chorus: Demoz]
AOTP, they know we be, O-N T-O-P
(Die mother fucker, die)
Fucking with these gentlemen, we run up in your residence, get you for your presidents
(Die mother fucker, die)
Make up the break up, I don't wanna wake up, If I don't got my cake up
(Die mother fucker, die)
AOTP, on top we be he he he he
(Die mother fucker, die)

[Verse 3: Demoz]
The psycho's back strong enough to push the Eifel back
Halloween mask, Michael's back
Stay in your lane, you no named niggas get lipo'd up
Lose weight when the rifle bust, I don't like you fucks
They want my life I want 5 mics, problem is I'm unsigned hyped
Fuck is the deal, give me life in the booth with no fucking appeal
I bet you my left lung they can't fuck with the skill 
Bet you my right hand they gon' die in the trauma
It's the front street terrorist I ride like Osama
It's a thin line between a prick and a fool
But these faggots they keep acting like snitching is cool
Man these faggots they keep acting like I ain't a beast
Till their face is next to their sons under the beach
Food for the crabs mission accomplished nigga take it in blood
It's a wrap, my crew acting like Satan is loved

[Verse 4: Vinnie Paz]
I'm Jesus in reverse, the son of Satan with a fire arm 
Water to blood, apocalyptic fire storm 
You a sucka rapper, never know what side you on 
I shoot my biscuit in the air until the sky is gone 
A 16 of mine murder your entire song 
9M submachine is long like your entire arm 
I'm a loud mouth fucka not a quiet storm 
I don't believe in an afterlife so once you die you gone 
Never nothin soft, everythin' a violent song 
Kanye West, gay rapper, thats when lines are drawn 
Qwest hit me with a beat like he Italian mom 
It aint even beef no more, its Hillshire Farm 
I aint gonna leave your family any time to mourn 
My clenched fist shows the power that's inside the palm 
The same 'palm that was taking human lives in 'Nam 
And I ain't stoppin it till' all these human lives are gone 

[Chorus: Demoz]
AOTP, they know we be, O-N T-O-P
(Die mother fucker, die)
Fucking with these gentlemen, we run up in your residence, get you for your presidents
(Die mother fucker, die)
Make up the break up, I don't wanna wake up, If I don't got my cake up
(Die mother fucker, die)
AOTP, on top we be he he he he
(Die mother fucker, die)

[Outro: Vinnie Paz]
Cocksucker (hahaha)
Brap brap, yeah
Big Louis Doggs (yeah)
The genocide general (motherfucker)
Doap Nix (AOTP)
Demoz
Planetary
AOTP
Qwest on the beat
It ain't a game baby
Brap brap, hahaha

(Die, motherfucker die, die, die motherfucker die)</pre>
