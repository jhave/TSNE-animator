Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Riding down the street
and I see a pretty girl
she wants me, I want her
I will take her to my world
I'm in my car
I'm stunting in my car
You know I'm in my car
I'm stunting in my car

[Verse 1 - Stunnaman]
Yea im higher than a light pole

in a rubberband stupidddd and

crack street stuntin in my car
