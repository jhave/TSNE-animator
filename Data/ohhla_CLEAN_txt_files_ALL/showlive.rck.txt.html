And I made up the name called the Get Fresh Crew
It was me, my true DJ, true that'll be
My right hand man Ricky D
Rappers sing, make sounds and things
For example, here's a telephone ring
Ring, ring) Hello, is Doug E. Fresh in right now
(No, he's not in right now, but anyway, no more delay
Check out the new style I display
Now you got to be fresh, to rock wit fresh
I'm D-O-U-G-I-E Fresh, and I'm know for the---
Not for the--
The human beat box on the entertainer
No other title can fit me plainer
Passing generation, I am a remainder
Also known as a beat box trainer
Cashing checks, sound effects
I'm finish rocking, Slick Rick is on next)
You know it (Slick Rick)
Well, here's a little something that needs to be heard
Doug, I was going downtown (Word Rick?) word
Chillin all alone, no one to be wit
Stepped on the D-Train, 205th
I saw a pretty girl (so) so I sat beside her
Then she went roar, she was Tony the Tiger
I said, oh darn, there has been a mistake
Honey, my name's Slick Rick, not Frosty Flakes
(Oh, golly wolly) She was raised in hell
She said, um, my name is Maggie, but call me Michelle
Michelle by belle, something w--
Sippin on some, Slick Rick and I'm rock house
Ya know I'm sayin? When I'm on the mic, there won't be no delayin
Bust a move, we show and prove
Aiyo, Doug (what?) Do that record jam on a groove
[Doug E. Fresh beatboxin and more 'Oh My God']
Yeah Doug, yeah Doug, yeah Doug, haha
{As you can see} (Most definitely, we are, fresh)
{Chill Will} (Right here, Ricky D and I am the original
Human beatbox, the entertainer, Doug E. E. E. E. Fresh)
*crowd cheering*
Yeah, yeah, yeah</pre>
