(*talking*)
Yeah know I'm tal'n bout, Yung Redd mayn
Swishahouse the click, E-Class what they tal'n bout
Know I'm saying, TF nigga ay

[Yung Redd]
Spending money, that I ain't never had
In my hood I'm a star, with mo' stripes than your flag
If my watch sick, then my L ring's throwing up
Sideline niggaz, still talking I'm showing up
I hear em speaking, on a block they ain't seen
Paint job soaking wet, bet my jewelry can't me
All my hoes look like, they came off the screen
With a ass so fat, hair down to her knees
Got my H on my hat, shades match that
Drank I'm po'ing up, haze I'm burning that
I pop tags, I'm the one your gal talk about
My ring insane, look his chain Crayola box
Play the parking lot, do's up the Promenade
Trunk cracked like the sidewalk, you know what I'm bout
These out of town niggaz, thinking we slow
But my bread come fast, and getting all mine back

[Hook]
I got my ape's laced up, now I'm running my block
Pockets busting at the seam, till them rubber bands pop
Mayn I been showing up, that's why them girls love me
You ain't gotta like me, but the hood love me
She ain't never met, a nigga this hood
Tell her we don't look good, then you don't look good
I ain't never faking, that's why them girls love me
Post up, way I'm feeling mean the hood love me

[E-Class]
I'm a hood cat, that got millionaire tendencies
Hit the scene, D's on a limousine lit with screens
Paint job, same color as promethazyne
Diamonds in my piece, liquid green like some Listerine
The blue bell wrist, the Dairy Queen pinky ring
All you can ice bitch, I'm some'ing like a skating ring
I told Johnny, I want it long as he make it bling
Bright so when it's light, as a light hit it and make a scene
The hoes wet, cause they liking the way I make it seem
Easy to get gutter and butter, working a triple beam
My 16's, are carosine and gasoline
Margaritas next to electric heaters, releasing steam
I'm dedicated, and deep in love with this music thing
I ain't leaving no time soon, you should get use to me
I got a on-going problem, I don't know who to see
That'll help me handle my feddy, and getting cream

[Hook]

[Willie D]
Cat niggaz, bow down to the realest
I ain't jumping on a track, if the hood can't feel it
Relentless is the label, but I fuck with Swishahouse
Run up on me partna, bet you I ain't gon miss your mouth
Lexus Cadillacs, alligators and shrimps
Texas is the home, of the players and pimps
Respect that, cause if you come around here plexing
You going back home, in the cargo section
Stay on my grind, I ain't the sorry type
Not what you had in mind, but I'm what your daughter like
You want her with a cake, but she desire a strong nigga
That's why everytime I see the bitch, I'ma long dick her
Niggaz eating, cause a Northside playa took a gamble
Nelly made the song, but I started country grammar
They focused on my city right now, cause we blowing up
It's Willie motherfucking D, I been showing up
