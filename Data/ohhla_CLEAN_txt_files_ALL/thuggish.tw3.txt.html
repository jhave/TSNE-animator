[Tommy Wright III]
One day I'm at the store finna get rung up by the cashier
On the front of a magazine bone punks in harmony
Flip to the page what do I see?
Bone talking bout Memphis Tennessee like a dog call us country
I don't see a mothafucking thang funny
Head to the airport buy ten tickets
Cause ten wanted men on vacation
Saint Claire niggas face down on the ground 
Anybody move (gunshot) with no hessitation
Talk that shit better come equipped put the grip to your dome
Tell me bone what you gonna do?
I hope yall fuck that dirty hoe Easy fucked so yall can die too
 
(Chorus 4x)
 
[Tommy Wright III]
Ya'll got five Tommy Wright got ten
Ten wanted men never hard to find
I already know where yall stay it's on your tape (East Ninety Nine)
I'ma leave you bleeding off that Cleaveland flat foot asking for directions
Aye dawg you know where bone stay?
(Man) Next house
Thanks playa (gunshot) Smith &amp; Wesson
I don't give a fuck got my hand on the pump
Get buck nigga didn't believe Tommy Wright could do it so crunk
Ballin through the hood tell my nigga guess what? (what?) I got bone off in my trunk (for real?)
Tommy be stealin and dealin a villian thats willin to crucifix bone in the killing
Tommy gonna wait till the first of the month get bone for they food stamps when we shoot em up
 
(Chorus 4x)

Other rappers had something to say but they didn't do a good enough job
I call myself the one man gang but tell the truth I'm coming with a fucking mob
Ain't no watermelon eating Memphis niggas be down wit street sweeping
Bone trying to check Girbauds and golds whats up with dem out of style afros?
Trying to get em braided Memphis Tennessee can't be faded
Tony Tone I'll make that leather glock look like that shit in Oklahoma
Leave you flesh hanging making you bitches wish you didn't say shit
Krayzie ain't as crazy as me too
Layzie to run I'ma get Bizzy with this gun 
Yeah I heard how you follow Eazy-E around Cali
Bet he never even heard you rap one time
Ten wanted men gon follow your ass 
but we gon be strapped with glizock nines
Keep Tennesee up out your mouth
next time a magazine ask you for a comment
We gonna see if you can still rap fast
when I snatch your tongue out from your stomach
B - Baggage bustaz bustin booties breaking each others backs 
O - Open your mouth again we coming to cleaveland fully strapped 
N - Never shot a nigga in your life your niggas would not wanna see you hanging from a tree
E - For the cheese you didn't receive got dicked in the ass by Eazy-E
 
(Chorus 4x)
 
[Tommy Wright III] (Talking)
I used to bump em but fuck em 
I read what you said in that book 
I saw the Vibe Magazine Februrary issue 
talking bad about Memphis Tennessee playa
Yall fucking with niggas that'll get plane tickets
Flat foot coming after you hoes money grow on trees
It ain't shit to us mane 
but anyway I'm through with that
Shout outs to my niggas Project Pimp
Mac T-Dawg Unknown and the T-Town Click
La-Chat Belly Tip-Toe Killa Cap Pilla and Mr. Tiny Mind
We fooled the world my nigga just to make that cheese
Watch out for them fake ass bootleg tapes
missing two or three songs and shit with dem typed ass stickers
My shit don't look nuthin like that ... {*talking to fade*}</pre>
