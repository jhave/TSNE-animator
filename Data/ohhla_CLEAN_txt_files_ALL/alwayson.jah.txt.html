(Ashanti) [Ja talking]
Always there when you call [Buckshots, hah], always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby

   (Chorus - Ashanti)
   Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
   And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
   I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
   And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

(Ja Rule)
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in boots and shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild
[With Ashanti] But we share somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

(Chorus)

Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a "Dear Ja" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparantly fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share [with Ashanti] somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

(Chorus)

Oh I'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
[With Ashanti] But who cares, you care

(Chorus)

(Ashanti)

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my....baby be mine
