On my Birth-Night



It's my birth-night, approaching birth-hour, birth-minute. I read in Jabes:



           There is no thought without body.  Where I speak,
        where I am silent, my body is the body of my thought.
           "Ah, the wound is deeper than we tend to believe,
        never completely visible," wrote Reb Souery.

No Way Out when It's Dark


(My words up my ass)

You can pull out the abacus, rework the rules, use adjacency to create the
semblance of a mind. You can exhaust yourself in the cold, not think; I
went out in a sweatshirt tonight, nothing else. It didn't work. The words
I wryte build a wall. You don't know me through it. I am only concerned
with their survival, by which I mean proper ordering. They come from afar.
"It sure is, the deep freeze is on. Tonight that snow is turning to ice.
Crews are frantically ploughing away. Can you believe a good number of
people skating in these bone-chilling temperatures? They haven't fallen
off that much, but a clearing line moving towards us. Look at this. That's
what it feels like." 

(My words up my cock)

This is a night I'd like to go visit a lover, a night I'd rather not be
online. I'd walk through the cold shirtless, my nipples pointed, air
congealing across my chest, sheen on me. I'd come to your door, nipples
frosted, internal ice, my chest yours alone. You'd like to write on me;
I'd like you to. Everything in this cold world would be perfect and you'd
write words about the body and I'd ask you to put the pen away or maybe
the ink would lose. There's nothing more to say; we keep talking on long
past the meaning of words, to the point where they're only good for nest-
ing. "That's what making the roads so dangerous. Many people have said
they have had enough. But it's not that much of a consolation. I hate the
snow. I want to go any place but New York. That's a thought. News Channel
4." 

(My words up my cunt)

This is a night where I realize the falsehood in my texts, their relation-
ship to obsession, my inability to walk away from them. That I've had no-
thing to say. That I write without thinking, guided by blind ambition. 
That this is a prison and misprison, that I garner only the framework of
thought, that I'm an emptied vessel, blah blah. That Europe has fallen,
that America is falling, blah blah. That there is blood on the horizon, 
blah blah. That white light blinds itself.

(My words up my head)

The longing


"Now I-Phaedra shall rest!"

You ask: Where are we in this distant land?

"You are victims of my words!"

You say: We march against your words, against their meanings, 
responding only to their sounds.

"Surely you would have done the same!"

You say: We would have done whatever you required of us...

"Now I-Phaedra shall rest!"

You ask: Ah, and leave us to our own devices?

"...and its dominions thereof"

You say: As if devices had dominions, as if they moved across 
sequestered fields...

"You can't see me! I'm never around!"

You say: But floating nonetheless there, above the landscape 
ruptured by pain and history.

"Who the men were, how they were armed!"

You say: How they attacked, how they ruined Europe, Asia, 
America, Africa, Australia as well.

"Now I-Phaedra shall rest!"

You exclaim: I-Phaedra sleeps with well-deserved rest 
in the midst of chaos!

"Now I-Phaedra shall rest!"

You exclaim: Sleep then, insistent one!

"I-Phaedra who shall sing to you:"

You say: The lullaby of rest, of armed men gone to battle, 
of sequestered fields and ghosts haunting history...

"Wait! Wait!"

You ask: And for what, while America burns?

"Place your sword by my side and I will sing to you!"

You say: But song is not enough, arms and the woman, 
resistance and the harmony of caverns beneath our feet...

"A sheen over all the world, encompassing"

You exclaim: Gathering us together, returning us to belief 
in past and future times. Alas, how one belies the other!

"Wait, I have more to tell you!"

You say: We await your word and our listening.

"I-Phaedra!"

You exclaim: Ah, Phaedra!

"You are victims of my words!"

You say: Leaving you at last, quitting this bleak dominion, 
history no longer, words blinded by ineffable light...

"Wait! Wait!"

You say: Ah no, leaving you at last...

"You can't see me! I'm never around!"

You say: Ah, I-Phaedra, ah...

(exiting, always exiting...)

Barricade!


Shall we close these lists to children? 
We must protect precious minds, just like we were protected!
This is an _absolute necessity._ 
It's what I call the _instrumental seed._
The seed is the _lever_ which allows us to absolve _ourselves,_ cleanse 
_ourselves,_ as well!
For example: No pornography whatsoever! It's harmful!
Would would ever think that _maturity_ would make such things acceptable?
Thus by the construct of the _instrumental seed_ of the child, the 
purified adult becomes possible.
It's what I call the _heavenly adult,_ one who enters heaven by virtue 
of the _work of God._
It is never too late to cleanse ourselves!
And are we not all children in the eyes of the Lord?
Therefore I propose: That we close these lists to children!
That _first,_ we require proof of age, and _second,_ of sanctity!
We must remember that we have been contaminated, _now,_ at any age!
That we have sinned!
For example: Most of us have spent our lives beneath the corruption
of _abortion!_ 
Thus millions of adults in the womb have been killed every day of our
normal existence!
Now here is the _instrumental seed_: Fight abortion at _any cost._
Others will concern themselves with the millions of children in the world!
Others will house them!
It is _our responsibility_ to take the first step.
It is _our responsibility_ to remember that first steps are always
sufficient!
First steps lead to the heavenly adult! I am sure of this!
Thus, to remain on this list, we require proof of _age and wisdom,_
proof of cleanliness, in fact what we choose to call _beauty proof!_
This will certainly make the Internet less rambunctious!
We will give you thirty-six hours! Don't take our word for it!
Our children depend on you!

(The List-Lord)

Hinge


Approaching the millennium is always on the side of the past. Encounter-
ing, the past is born elsewhere. This is a difference among the pasts and 
presents, not yet encountered. For what will have come in the 1990s will 
already have been relegated to an _other era._ What begins, begins with 
2000. (Never mind the arguments concerning 2001.) It is this gap I want 
to address, this transformation of our reckoning, shaking the very roots 
of temporality.

It is the rapture, the rupture of 2000; the _label_ is that of the past, 
the bracketing of a certain narrative, debris. 2000 is the moment of the 
first _surgical incision,_ marking a marked population which loses its 
past. The population possesses only embodiment and pure representation, 
what had been the past, constructed from the 19th century through the 
Annales group. "The past" no longer exists. There is no memory.

The incision is permanent tattoo. The incision marks the evolution or
petrification of what Derrida might label the _other heading_: "But beyond
_our heading,_ it is necessary to recall ourselves not only to the _other
heading,_ and especially to the _heading of the other,_ but also perhaps
to the _other of the heading,_ that is to say, to a relation of identity
with the other that no longer obeys the form, the sign, or the logic of
the heading, nor even of the _anti-heading_ - of beheading, of decapita-
tion." And no longer obeys, that is to say, the time of language itself,
the temporality of languaging: _after_ 2000, everything is inconceivably
_new,_ of that there is no doubt; even the tethering to 1999 is questiona-
ble, forgotten. (A newness in which "form," "sign," "logic,"  have no
place, or rather perhaps the _novelty_ of "form," "sign," "logic," 
"past.")

What we are doing _here,_ on this side (which will no longer be a side or
become a side), is the work of absence, not of preparation, for which
there is no need, and not of production. We are _biding time._ Momentar-
ily, we are the construct of time. Momentarily, we exist within the aegis
of tense, demarcations of temporal fields. 

The collapse will be in absolute silence, hardly an _existence._ Once
there, nothing will have _occurred,_ which is precisely the point, punc-
tum, construct that will have been forgotten. But we will never, this gen-
eration of those alive among the hinge, read or inscribe the past again;
never again will the past have existence _as past_ for us. In 2000, 1998,
1999, will be as if they had occurred in an indefinite and final progres-
sion, a matter of statisticians at best. And this, _naturally,_ no matter 
what we may think or do.

_We have never yet confronted the new._ (And so it will of course not be a
confrontation or an existence, neither an inscription nor a circumscrip-
tion. Thus it will be the same, fissured. Thus something never before con-
fronted.)

Manna


So I'm just finishing Allucquere Rosanne Stone's The War of Desire and
Technology at the Close of the Mechanical Age, a book I brought to the
Opening Night performance of Merce Cunningham's company at the Joyce,
Event. The music was by Robert Ashley and Takehisa Kosugi among others (I
had known Ashley years ago; memories were thick), the background by Raus-
chenberg. 

The movements were precise, awkward, perfect, crystalline, intense, as
usual; Cunningham did two solos and interacted twice with the company.
He's quite old. Stone writes about distributed selves and bodies with an
analysis that's somewhat Foucauldian. The gender-changing psychiatrist
figures into the discussion. The gender of the dancers was clear but their
lines were irrelevant and gender did play a role in several pieces al-
though the role was unclear. What was clear was gravity and positioning
and the labor involved which was the inverse of the soundworks, in which
labor in fact was dissipated through electronics; what was necessary as
pure skill in the dance was modulated into chip memory in the sound. These
inversions nonetheless worked well together. The stage like a screen was a
proscenium but the sound like a voice was all around and involving the
spectatorial body. 

What came through was however the grounding in muscle, which years ago
also Carolee Schneeman emphasized, as did Michael McClure among others.
I'd put even Oldenburg in that group, maybe Al Hanson, definitely Beuys
and Vostell. Not the last gasp of modernism, but the presence of flesh _in
the midst of the postmodern,_ in the midst of cyberspace in fact. That the
flesh could always be torn, that the bladerunner with implant and beeper
could still be blown away, that concrete stanchions could surround the
linearity of a railroad car. 

It was and is a combination of this muscle, this flesh, and the stuff of
the world, and the stuff won't go away. Don't assume for a second it will,
not with limited resources and burgeoning populations. And certainly not
with the state of the universe itself, a cosmos of plasma and forgetting,
with planets rare exceptions in the midst of the mass. Even common planets
rare exceptions. The universe roars, dissipates; there's got to be sound
in the sun, hurtling waves through the gases. And it's not organized,
cleansed, binary, perfect - it's the sound of concrete surrounding rail-
road cars (Vostell), the sound of flesh moving at high speed across the
floor (Kimberly Bartosik), the sound of a voice _at work_ describing the
site by the bank of the river which was untoward, a backdrop to local
conversation (Ashley). 

It's dance that reminds us that cross-dressing can only go so far, that
surgery, _incision,_ is necessary for the rest of the gaze. It's Stone's
book, ironically, that reminds us that narrative is still at the heart of
theory; the text is surprisingly linear, simply folding back in upon it-
self. She can't resist a good story, the railroad car can't resist conc-
rete, the dancer can't resist gravity. Whatever defies is only a diacri-
tical mark in the midst of chaos; it won't last long. I imagine however
Merce going on for a few more years, but I found myself immensely sad,
wondering whether this is the last I'll see of his wonderful performances.
He is the last of Buster Keaton; the resemblance and silence is astound-
ing, as is the reliance on gravity to lift one up again.

Change


One of the first books I read on Net materials was Bernard Aboba's The 
Online User's Encyclopedia (Bulletin Boards and Beyond), which came out 
in November 1993, less than two and a half years ago. It's still valu- 
able for historic information (beginnings of the Internet, FidoNet and so 
forth), and for basic unix shell information, but it is amazing how much 
is already outdated.

For example: 

It covers talk, but not ntalk or ytalk.

It says nothing about M** clients for pc.

The Web is covered in seven pages; XMosaic, windows Cello, and MacMosaic 
are mentioned - oddly enough, lynx isn't. Netscape and other clients 
aren't either of course.

FTP and Gopher are considered accessible only through unix or clients, 
since the URL protocols were hardly in existence.

MIRC isn't mentioned.

There's a large emphasis on bulletin boards and FidoNet.

There's mention of a graphic MUD, BSXMUD, at robin.lysator.liu.se 7475 
and has anyone tried this out? Apparently "it requires use of special 
client software, only available for the PC."

WAIS is covered in detail. I've yet to have satisfactory searches on WAIS.
There is excellent information throughout on SLIP, PPP, and TCP/IP 
including some of the port numbers for telnet (available elsewhere in 
full). 

There is full information on BITNET including however the statement that 
"With universities turning away from mainframes and embracing the 
Internet, BITNET membership peaked in 1991, and is now slowly shrinking."

The Internet backbone is still NSFNET.

There are few ISPs listed, although Echo in New York; The World 
(world.std.com) in Massachusetts; The Well, Hybrid Networks, and The 
Holonet in California; Old Colorado City Communications; and Netcom 
(based in California but national) are all singled out.

There's almost nothing on AOL, CompuServe, etc. although there are two 
graphics pages "A Day in the Life of a CompuServe User" and the same for 
AOL - the Net is pretty much absent on these except for email.

CompuServe's rates are interesting - $39.95 startup, and 9600 bps for $16 
an hour on on eplan, $22.50 on another!
AOL lists for $9.95 a month plus $3.50 an hour.
Delphi's got $5.95 a month plus $6 an hour.
I do like the Dow Jones New Retrieval for primetime at $12.60 to $129.60 
an hour.
The Well is listed for $15 a month and $2 an hour.
All of these rates have dropped considerably.

At the time of the book, there were 4000 newsgroups and 2 million users; 
now Netcom alone carries over 16000 newsgroups.

You get the picture. Even now, there's no sign of things slowing down 
except for the entrenchment of M**, IRC, and email list communities. The 
newer search engines for example (Inktomi, Altavista) are rapidly re- 
placing the others. Audio, video, and extended graphics/animation modal- 
ities are coming to the foreground. Software beta versions are appearing 
at an increasingly fast rate, which means that the hacking ethos as 
opposed to top-down tested approaches is coming back into style. More 
alpha versions are being released as well.

Silicon valley extends world-wide, with particularly heavy development in 
the United States, Canada, and the Scandinavian countries. The Net in one 
form or another is spreading in much the same way that television/radio 
did, in spite of the increased complexity of CMC - there are no galena 
crystals in cyberspace. The information industry is becoming more and 
more sweatshop-oriented as a result.

It's anybody's guess where we'll be five years from now. In the meantime 
the Aboba book provides an interesting historic document; you might also 
want to look at Hobbes' Internet Timeline which is always being updated, 
and invaluable books like Peter H. Salus' Casting the Net, From Arpanet 
to Internet and Beyond... or Carl Malamud, Exploring the Internet, A 
Technical Travelogue, written in 1993 as well, covering world-wide Net 
implementations and their histories.

It's a wonderful day in the neighborhood.


It's this way. I look out across Fifth Avenue down Dean Street into an
area I don't dare walk at night. I look past an apartment window across
the street on Fifth in which an intense young woman sits at her computer
and types for hours. Down Dean on the right I can see the firetrucks go in
and out; when the approach the loft, the noise is overwhelming. I can
follow Fifth to the left where it enters Flatbush and there is a wide area
I've heard called no man's land because it's between neighborhoods and in
the process of being rebuilt. The Long Island Railroad station has been
torn down; there's just a hut there, minimal underground services. I can
see across to the projects; I don't dare go over there, about a half mile
away. The traffic on Flatbush is different than the traffic on Fifth which
is different than that on Dean; all three traffics define different nodes
or patterns, different populations or vectors across the tumor called
Brooklyn. There are few trees visible anywhere; I'm three flights up, and
you can see cacti outlined in the window facing the woman. The loft is
often overheated or overcold; during the former periods, I walk naked
everywhere, conserving the heat exchange with bare skin, visible perhaps
from the street as an organism or virus on the alert. I don't know. I'm
always restless. There's little environmental cushioning for theory which
I write here, certainly not in the corner shop or the hairdresser's next
door or the bar on the other side of the small parking-lot or the boarded
up corner building to my left or the sporting-goods store diagonally
across the street. Theory is superfluous. What I read shatters to the
ground. It is a landscape of absolution; little is open late at night
except for a bodega next to the policestation around the corner from the
firestation. Services get bundled here; at the other end of my block on
Dean there's an unemployment office, and a block away, welfare. There are
various medical/hospital/psychiatric services in the area as well, inclu-
ding an AIDS office; there are other small clinics. All have the charac-
ter of social agencies serving the poor, and in a spot like this you can
see the hardness of the city; there's less and less cushioning for them as
well. Why do I tell you these things? Because theory isn't produced in a
vacuum, because the space _here_ in which I am writing at the moment is
enormously fragile in relation to the social/physical, no matter what
theorists say or do. The real is a long way from wiring-up, jacking-in,
and when it does connect, the street doesn't disappear. And looking out
the window tonight, feeling exposed, desiring, exhausted, neurotic, un-
written, I felt that the one advantage of living _here_ was the continuous
reminder of these states, and that they're not by any means texts. Earlier
in fact, I thought about humans fucking, how when I fuck I look closely 
into someone's eyes, how everything and nothing is mirrored or flowing 
there, the fear and attraction. How different from most other organisms. 
How we always already face the real, cyberspace watch out.

Disgust with Bill


Thomas rolled around and with a bone-crunching thud gouged out Clara's 
eyes; in turn, she snapped Tiffany's wrist as if it were paper. Bones 
stuck out jagged through the skin, purple and blood-red welts. Honey 
fired once and Thomas went down, intestines releasing their hold on the 
fabulous meal they had enjoyed a few minutes before at Del Monte's. 
Clara's brutally emptied sockets were the last she knew of life, blood 
spurting as the four of them fell through the plate-glass window; trans- 
parent jagged shards cut through Honey's abdomen, severing her hand in 
the process. They were dead before they landed, lucky for them - the mob 
below continued the process of dismemberment. Drooling hulks feasted on 
limbs torn from their sockets; the mutilated faces were unrecognizable.

Luckily the genitalia were still relatively intact and no one swore; it's 
wasn't until much later, when Travis and Cynthia made love, that the 
censors were called. On the way to jail Travis joked that "obscenity was 
in the eyes of the beholder, and of course they were gouged out."

The Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns


Intelligence is clearly distributed, among structures, brain areas; what-
ever appears is emergent. Entities are clearly distributed; in Structure
of Reality, I defined an entity as roughly the k-ply union of the inter-
sections of its descriptors. k implied thresholding and emergence can be
considered a variety of _active_ thresholding in which weights, networks,
structures, and linguistics are all variable; what results in fact is a
form of collapse into the construct of entity, name, etc. In the same 
work I defined state-representation-graphs and representation itself as
a loose (i.e. conceivably involving probabilities and "foreign" elements)
mapping from one matrix to another. In Hofstadter's Copycat program, "The
system has a connectionist flavor by virtue of spreading activation in
the slipnet." (Franklin, Artificial Minds; also see Hofstadter on fluid
analogies.) On MOOs, objects are constructed through wryting; in cyber-
space, bodies are constructed through hysteric embodiment. In Stone's
work, as well as Turkle's, Butler's, etc. the construct of gender is par-
amount and in fact the physical body itself becomes problematic in the
first two. Electrons as particles are found within probability clouds
and as everyone knows particles behave as waves and vice versa. Reality
tends to diffuse in the very late twentieth century, as if it will at 
last turn transparent in the year 2000; the opposite in fact is still
the case in many parts of the world where bodies are close to equivalent
to lost generations, internment, detention and disease. The world cannot
sustain its obdurate status; it tends towards the transparent and per-
haps this is also what the virus perceives? 

Because it's _not_ that there is a point to this, but only a pointer
itself to the opposite, that it is pointless and diffuse, even the ob-
durate, even death which is becoming a _deduction._ For ourselves, for
myself, I await _nothing_ for nothing is within and without the state
of nature, a state which dissolves into foreign states and dissolutions
- this isn't a _situation_ of the critique of nations (not a critique
at all): _Whatever is named falls apart._ Kripke was wrong; when infor-
mation deconstructs natural kinds, language loses its holdfast. But
Saussure was wrong; when language loses holdfast, difference collapses
as well and one is left with the _mentioning_ of pointers. 

And in the midst of all of this (postmodernity): the past appears only
_as an emergent property itself,_ the result of blind copycat thresh-
olding. So isn't death a residue?

Think _on_ this.

Communication Beyond Communication


Good evening. I want to speak about something I am calling "Communication
Beyond Communication," which refers to more than the title of this talk;
in fact, it presuppose a supplement to communication which exceeds this
or any other framework. Such a supplement does not, however, presuppose
either a metaphysics or a teleological impulse towards spirit of whatever
sort; instead it describes by its very supple impulse, an issue of _band-
width,_ and what it is possible to ascertain in any consensual orienta-
tion. One might well argue that sexuality alone is that supplement or at
least exceeds the issue of supplement, since the symbolic, almost always
imminent, is replaced by the imaginary, the shuddering itself within the
real. One need, however, not turn towards the Lacanian in order to compre-
hend that up to and perhaps encompassing the sexual, there is always al-
ready a tendency towards _gesture,_ gestural logics, extensions (speci-
fically non-distributivity) enlarging whatever mode one enters within. 

Now the specificity of speech or print, in lieu of any other accompanying
discourse, is the speech of the telephone or the Internet, in spite of
_this_ speech, which is a presentification in which the issue of embodi-
ment hardly arises. And the telephone or Internet (I am speaking of 
ascii, specifically, lower ascii, here) constructs an uncanny intimacy -
the former, because the voice is ikonic in relation to the voice, and the
latter, because distance (absence of Levinasian alterity) can be an open-
ing or positivity (i.e. the negation of the every-day is absent). Both
modes then for different reasons tend towards one another.

If there is _reason_ to the uncanny, part of it lies in the lack of the
body here, just as pornography itself lacks the flesh, and reconstructs
it in the form of serial representations (exhausting, through defuge, one
or another image, entering into the circulation of commodities). It is
this very lack which spurs the desire for communication beyond communica-
tion, for _something else_ in addition to the _stuff_ carried within the
bandwidth, loaded stuff, overdetermined and underdetermined simultaneous-
ly. It's overdetermined by the body itself, and underdetermines the self-
same body of the other. This is a continuous process.

And it is a process which, like pornography, creates a circulation of
community and communication, brings one back into the group or a sense of
the participatory. Not to mention that it is the participatory (at least
in its relation to the other) that drives the communication in the first
place.

Out of this, out of all of this, yearning emerges; it is yearning which
creates the illusion of the _horizon_ of cyberspace, a cyber_spatiality_
in fact which is non-existent, but appears, like the rainbow, to have an
end in bodies which are no longer, have never been, virtual. In the un-
canny this is the _doing_ and _undoing_ of bodies, the unraveling of the
real and the wandering in the return to the symbolic; all one has, after
this all is said and done, is the screen itself, in its fecundity, its
production of the textual which is never a fellow-traveler.

That is all that needs to be said _on the subject,_ and I would continue
except for the very obvious fact that I am tired, exhausted in fact (all
these facts!) with the considerable traveling I myself have had to do,
in fact, to come here and speak to you this evening.

Thank you.

The Poor Post of the Playing Fields of the Goddess


There is always a business that surrounds a text-driven application within
a graphic interface. It can range from advertising on some of the downloa-
ded chat clients, to buttons always signaling an alternative. Thus one is
faced with the model of a tree or holarchy from everywhere within the Net.
At the prompt, space appears; within X-windows on linux, there may be no-
thing at all. Space is boundless, and shells and other forms of subterran-
ean life coagulate upon it. But within the GUI, there is only inscription
and determination; the result is a _setting_ that varies according to the
application, but always contains within it the seeds of its own branching
or dissolution. 

This isn't a minor point; there are two different ways of approaching the
net, just like poetics of a sort - a tablature or sonnet, and a field or
potential manifold. The prompt approaches the latter, which fascinates me
since there is within it a simulacrum of cyberspace, lending itself to-
wards the metaphor. The former however is laid out, presenting navigable
surfaces which may lead anywhere and everywhere, but never stray too far
from port. 

The former is classic AI, the latter connectionist or post-connectionist. 
The former is Boolean, the latter non-distributive. The former is the 
Young-Helmholtz model of color vision and/or classical particles and the 
latter is the post-Land/David Marr theories of color vision and/or 
superimposition. 

But the former contains within it the seeds of teleology, permission, and
protocol, and hence is at the heart of TCP/IP for example, the material
substrate forming the _stuff_ of the surface, just as protocol itself is
met with its own representations all the way down, nothing stopping at the
level of the atomic. It's good to remember this. It's good to remember the
demographics also, which don't and never can mirror ourselves, nor should
we desire that mirroring. I will split within the field of the Goddess. I
will work accordingly.

Representation


Stan Franklin, in Artificial Minds, characterizes the third AI debate as a
concern with the viability of representations. Representation is not
_necessary_ within some AM (artificial mind) implementations, and in fact
this viewpoint seems to resonate strongly with Sartre's in Psychology of
Imagination. For I would argue that representation is not only emergent,
but also a construct which is only necessary under certain circumstances.
For example, if I use the word "dog" in a sentence (i.e. "I walk the
dog.") there is no reason to assume that a signified is produced whatso-
ever - instead the word fits into sublated networking - the representation
only occurs _as a deliberate production_ - i.e. "What sort of a dog is it?
Can you describe it?". I bring forth Sartre's discussion of the internal
image of the Pantheon, which was also implicitly a construct. So not only,
according to a paradigm emerging (or an imaginary emerging perhaps - find-
ing "paradigm" problematic), do entities, etc. exist only as emergent phe-
nomena (throwing the notion of difference into issues of skittering sur-
faces at best), but also representation itself is emergent; not only do
bacteria, say, do without it, but humans do without it, unless a mode of
representing _is explicitly called forth._ In fact, representation could
be considered _a mode of the interrogative,_ the answer to a question
which necessarily implies, at least vis-a-vis _parole,_ the production of
a series of statements embodying the epistemology of the query itself. If
on-line I am asked what I look like (to take the simplest situation), I
respond by _wryting_ a representation of myself, which comes-into-being
_through_ the wryting and its symbolic. And I would argue that even in-
ternal body mapping, for example, is not a representation, but demarca-
tions which flicker in and out of existence in response to circumstances.
For example, the mapping would include a bandwidth of acceptable tempera-
tures, but this would not be "part" of a representation, only something
constructed when necessary (i.e. it's below freezing outside). 

Most of this is hardly new; what matters here is the relative obviousness
of it all. Consider language again and its peculiar symptomologies once
again; if a speaker had representations of each word appear in turn, in 
almost any everyday sentence, the result would be a Borgesian catatonia,
not competency. The remarkable thing is not that _language represents,_ 
but for the most part, that _it doesn't._ (Perhaps the opposite is true 
of mathematics.)

And what holds for language, holds elsewhere within the cognitive domain.
Art is clearly concerned with the production of representations, to the
extent that it produces bodies or embodiments; even conceptualism resulted
in numerous texts, statements, performances, mathematizations, etc. 

But art isn't the point here; in fact, almost any conversation may involve
representations - or at least certain affectual domains. When a couple
argues, they produce such a domain (which is recognized in the notion of
an argument "getting the best of them"). When a group of people discuss
a television show, for another example, images from past episodes may be
called forth, re-produced (reproduction is production); these are as
creative as Sartre's examples, and tethered to the real by production-
algorithms (which are thresholding, emergent, fuzzy themselves).

I wonder if it would be accurate to say, that a violent crime, on the part
of the perpetrator, is _without representation_? That it is the impossi-
bility (not just the absence) of representation that creates or participa-
tes in the conditions of crime? Which is to say as well that representa-
tion involves empathy, investment, and one reason why it does not come in-
to play, is unnecessary in being-in-the-world, is the result of a specific
_economy of being_ that is at odds with thinking-through-the-object. 

Of course this text is full of errors; I'm jumping randomly among levels.
Take for example, body temperature. _Somewhere_ there must be acceptable
bandwidths. But again these need be no more than learned experience, not
representation; the body is in continuous negotiation with the world. Go
further and take a discussion of a television show. The show was viewed,
the diegesis was constructed within the viewer. Later, this becomes a
matter for memory; most of the diegesis is forgotten - what does remain is
a matter of clues, symptoms, which can be constituted into memory. I would
argue that there are numerous levels of compression at work here, using
techniques at times reminiscent, say, of video compression - and that
representation is a result of this decompression. (Even now, for example,
suppose I picture, represent, to myself, the image of a lover. I can
"picture her exactly," but if asked what clothes she is wearing, I
immediately, internally, create a wardrobe. Even with something as "basic"
as the eyes, I create an image. And note that _this_ image - which is a
representation - may be at variance with "seeing" her in real life - in
the latter situation, the slightest anomaly may attract attention. Sup-
pose she has had her nose pierced - I might remark on it. This does not
mean however that the constructed image _had as a characteristic a non-
pieced nose_ - in fact, this is the crux of the matter, since I am argu-
ing that _no such characteristic_ was called forth at all, that the pier-
cing itself creates an addendum or diacritical mark, to be added to the
later constructions (if such fantasies are desired), and that representa-
tion itself works _only_ from these diacritial marks, which may be few and
far between.)

Are there generalized higher-order abstractions which are representa-
tions, for example, ideal forms, a representation of human? Again, I'd
argue no, that mind proceeds by conservatism, and anomaly alone, not
constituted by difference, but by emergence, would be remarkable. Take
the parenthetical of the lover again. There would be biases among the
neural machinery, out of which "she" would emerge, partially remembered
(I may forget the next-to-last fight for example). The piercing would
add to the biases, but the totality of the biases would not be a repre-
sentation of her, but a potential production, intermixed with other po-
tential productions. There would be no fixity, no fetishization, that
would constitute a framework here. (In this regard, fetishization may be
considered a retardation of the world, an intensification of object/
objectivity, in order to create a modicum of control. Fetishes are crea-
ted precisely when the world seems out of control, through sickness, 
death, love, colonization; they stop objects from sliding beyond tradi-
tional ontologies of representations, which are part and parcel of tradi-
tional culture, into the world of construct, diacritics, production. I
might add that science itself is construct, diacritics, concerned with 
the devolution of entities.)

It's easy to shoot this argument full of holes, and even within the more
carefully delimited areas of say Winograd, Hofstadter, and Franklin, the
verdict is still out. But it does seem that, more and more, the geopoli-
tical nature of the real, which is based on aristotelian logic, inscrip-
tion, and the integrity of the organism, is giving way to a fragmentation
in depth - and the notions of nomadicism, microterritorialization, etc.,
popular in  French thought then become a rearguard action. Deleuze and
Guattari returned to the machinic and flows, just at the moment when the
machinic itself began its fall into submergence, and flows also produce
turbulent "animals," which we take for the world itself.

Walking in Wilkes-Barre


I was in the Martz bus station in Wilkes-Barre Penna. on the way back to
the city early this morning, and I was in the Martz station twenty minutes
early. So I paced first back and forth across the line-of-sight of the
other passengers seated, waiting. That didn't do it. I was in the Martz
station and I managed to _circumambulate_ the passengers, walking to their
right, behind them (retaining wall), around through the lobby of the sta-
tion, in front of the ticket counter (their left), across a pillar and 
wouldn't you know it, across their field of view once again, the same as 
the line-of-sight. I completed three to the left, one to the right, two 
to the left. I thought about everything. I should mention the station is 
small, poorly lit, tile floor and walls, facing the square of a rather 
battered city.

After I was done thinking about everything I thought I wasn't there, and I
wondered if I've been noticing this more recently because of cyberspace. 
I thought I was somewhere and this was a consensual reality. No, that's 
not true - it was decathected, defuge; it was that it didn't matter be- 
cause I was there or not but I felt I wasn't, it was peripheral. And this 
is tied to inside and outside, not on or off the bus. I should mention I 
had had no sleep, none at all.

When I'm outside I'm aware of the ground under me, that I'm walking on 
hardness pretty much all the way down, pipes and other substructure not- 
withstanding. And I'm aware it's not my hardness, not even borrowed; I'm 
there in an abstract relation with it, mediated in fact (Marx's 1844 
notebooks still a clue). When I'm here in the loft where I am now, there 
is a relation of security, even though it's not my space; it's demarcated 
and has a history. The cat here is the same; her personal relationship 
clearly isn't with me but the space. When I was away, the people who 
stayed who she had never met before were fine substitutes. But the space 
itself is integral to her, hard-wired at the moment, obdurate, thick, 
pebbled. It's _that._ It's connected to cyberspace in some way; I'm sure 
of it. 

So when I'm outside I feel I'm still inside or controlling things. Or 
maybe am. This is the first stage of psychosis; the second is realizing 
there is no one to talk to. Not even no one else. That there is no one to 
talk to.

(Or that there is no one talking. Because from the place of safety, the
outdoors simply _is not,_ and the mind sinks always into itself, beneath
or among the emergences. That is where it is where it delights in this
writing and mourns the world. That is where it is where the world is not.

Commas are breaths and when I am tired as tired now they often disappear. 
They ground the text to the body and the body's blows. Where are they? At 
times, now and then, they appear. They're held up rarely by longer words. 
Those fly. But the words aren't the words and the body's absent as well 
carried off by the commas. The diacritique I spoke of in the text on 
representation and emergence. As if there were marks of the things them- 
selves.)

The Thing in the Bed of the Lake


[Sometimes I can't get it right, the writing, which churns, runs on, the 
meaning worn smooth across the jagged edges of faulty style. Sometimes 
though there is an interstitial gleam, as in the text below.]

A while ago, I believe, I wrote (there are so many texts, it's difficult
for me to remember) about an experience I had in the Galil, in the vicin-
ity of a dried lake-bed back in the 1960s, when I was spending a year in
Israel studying prehistory. There was an excavation going on, returning
Olduvai tools (clai tzoor) to the surface, and I was amazed at the quan-
tity - I had always assumed that australopithecine axes (for that's what
they were considered at that point) would be relatively rare. Instead,
there was an acre of bags of them, all removed and labeled from trenches
that had originally been bulldozed out (believe it or not - and I wonder
if this technique is still used today). There were literally millions of
axes, a great midden of stone tools. I remember walking along one of the
trenches, in fact, and touching the tools which were like pebbles, roughly
carved, embedded in the sidewalls - and feeling a sense of the uncanny (as
best I can put it) realizing that the last _person_ who had touched these
was not quite human. On one hand, the quantity, and on the other, the
distance, as if the distance were up close, rubbed in one's face, the
searing energy of it all. Since then, among other things, I have wondered
about _names,_ and whether there were names here in the midst of the
middens, whether or not these _people_ were called, summoned by names, by
languaging beyond the ikonic. It also started me thinking, from that point
/this point on, about protolanguage and the contention that language ap-
pears all-at-once, that there is a syntactic threshold, and how that must
apply, how cultural poverty (from our supposedly cornucopic viewpoint) is
accompanied nonetheless by the growth of enormous feed-forward abstrac-
tion. 
  
Meanwhile there is the experience of the thing in the bed of the lake, the
objet petit a, the ding-an-sich, because it's probably just now, upon
sight and citation, that it's acquiring a name beyond the site. It remains
locked in mind where it has joined other constructs and I recall only the
recall, adding to the surfaces of the stone as time goes on. Now many of
them were hardly worn, surfaces and stones, and therefore what was the
need of flaking still another? Unless of course there might have been rit-
ual involved in this, _singular_ usage for example, before discarding.
That is to say empathy between the stone and its use, what we might call
the matrix or the Net. Because even over time, it's hard to account for
that acre of bags of tools, even over hundreds of thousands of years, all
of them available on more or less the same plateau. All of them, they did
fit in the hand.

The Archaic Nature of Men


Men are doomed; victimized by point/set mentality and reduction/frame-
working, they harbor the last of the top-down hackers. As the Net spreads
it becomes more and more, not feminized or even feminist, but riot grrrl,
and it all comes home in Carla Sinclair's Net Chick, A Smart-Girl Guide to
the Wired World. Note the hyphen in "Smart-Girl" which slangs it, collap-
ses the phrase. This is the first Net guide that's worth buying for every-
one, particularly since it signals a sea-change, one which the pricks in
Washington can't and won't buy into. What are they afraid of?

The men are afraid of losing the girls the grrrls. They're afraid they're
redundant, that the sea change blows the pricks out to sea. They're afraid
that the Net's a membrane, not a highway, that they can't look can't stare
any more, that their kids are already fucking and liking it more than 
they ever did. They're afraid of sleaze because they find their own names 
right there in the middle of it.

But it's not just them, it's me, you, and every man, because the Net is 
coming for this change, conning for it, and the only energy left isn't 
Nirvana but Courtney Love - it's easy to get sick of songs which descend 
the scale on every phrase and teen-age male anxiety hasn't changed since 
the days of Chatterton (dead 1772 for those who don't know). Back then it 
was a class thing and maybe a language thing; now it's everything - what 
happens when the leader of the pack is riding a _thing_ and everyone else 
is in for bodies and talk?

We're anachronistic. Our particular hormones worked well on the savanna
but not here, not now. The control of consciousness, consciousness of con-
trol (COC) is unnecessary, anathema in a world which emphasizes coagula-
tion instead of entity, emergence instead of taxonomy. We live to be TOPS
(tired old paradigms), and we can't even imagine women in that position
which is why we LOVE them there, o transgression! Forget it. We can't
possibly imagine there's nothing to transgress. 

As far as essentialism goes, it doesn't matter either way, I guess that 
grrrls are open to anyone's membership, but the book is definitely aimed 
at women and makes me realize why I wince listening to most male rock 
groups, have difficulties in crowds, stutter before authority, can't piss 
when other males are around (definitely a delta), but would go the dis- 
tance for P.J. or even early Bjork.

The Thick of It, Ending of a Life in Memory


( Now it was cold in the city, bitterly cold, and I was at Film/Video
Arts, and ran into Freddie. And it has been this way the past few weeks,
constant returns, circumambulations without end, spirals owned to no one
at all. The writing itself roils, shades and images of Da Vinci's latter 
drawings and Hokusai's waters. My life catches up with me, overtakes, 
swallows me whole. )

The annotation: "The thickness of memories. Waldrop and mss. Increasing
transparency, memories filling the gap (as I fade, others take my place,
become me)."

Translation: As I become more transparent, memories cover me, fill and
fulfill me; for example, bringing boxes of books to Keith and Rosmarie
Waldrop's house, getting ready to leave Providence. At the Merce Cunn-
ingham concert, Robert Ashley was one of the composers/performers (sound)
- I had met him through Alvin Lucier (the Once group, also with Gordon
Mumma and David Behrman), and that familiar voice made space the dancers
worked in. Then talking to Freddie Gafner today (dancer with the company)
and remembering and then walking out later and thinking of walking through
Providence because Ashley came through Keith (who had dated Yoko Ono and
was friends with George Maciunas and for that matter published my first
book, a volume of experimental writing called An,ode that was also my MA
thesis). So it gets to the point where I'm no longer _present,_ only (more
or less) a function of typing itself, conduit of memories swarming, liter-
al emergence again, and the I itself weakens, the coagulation or memb-
rane tears open, there I'm. Or not. Neither though a moment of other
voices - that's got to be understood. Keith wrote a blurb on the back of
my Disorders of the Real. Rosmarie I'm convinced never liked me. She's the
translator of Jabes. But at least there's less and less of me to like in
the first place. Lawrence Goldstein also hung out at K and R's and he's
got a few books out; I find them at the Strand. But I found myself not
fitting in with the quietude and etiquette there; I'd be around the corner
with Mike Metz, who will probably see this text, and who is an artist here
in NY now, certainly the friend I've been in touch with the longest. He
xeroxed a few hundred copies of Textbook of Thinking, otherwise that
would have never appeared either. Keith published a postcard I did which
read snow: are inches falling, and that was the end of it. But he got all
my work from the Bykert Gallery show I did in NY and some other stuff
including about four boxes of Vito Acconci's things, including original
manuscripts by himself, Bill Berkson and others. He got my whole edition
of the Evergreen Review, back to the first issue. Once I found him carry-
ing in boxes of Bulwer Lytton; I asked him why on earth, and he said be-
cause they were available. But Keith introduced me to Ashley who I remem-

he did and looks just about the same now, so it collapsed. Anyway, Robert
was there with the same voice of "she was a visitor" or maybe "she is a
visitor" when he described it to me and I remember once in a dark time
when he, Ashley, wrote me a letter saying I was the best writer in the
United States. Times are dark on those letters and the letters from Vito
and others, including Margaret's which I want to discard but haven't sadly
enough. But I did trade the Acconci picture for an air pistol, and I
published Acconci and Lucier among others in Individuals: Post-Movement
Art in America, and I was thinking of all of this walking to the R train
to leave Manhattan for Brooklyn - at least I think I was walking, there
were footsteps where occasional snow might be or might have been

The Frame (from two posts sent to Cybermind 2/14/96)

A few comments in regard to Dobie's and Richard's recent posts. First, Pip
and I are equal co-moderators. Second, re: Dobie, I didn't volunteer to
moderate/co-moderate; I began Cybermind with Michael Current and started
FOP myself. Which brings up a point that is rarely addressed in these
discussions, I think - the framework of the lists, the space, which is set
initially by the interest of the moderator to see discussion on some
subject or another. In other words, Michael and I established Cyb.  for
various reasons, invested our time, etc. So this was established not as a
completely open framework such as an agora where people meet on anything
(although it can of course turn into that) - it's thematic. Even talkers
are thematic. On talkers and IRC and havens, you can send topics in fact. 
Part of the phenomenology of governance then is the reasoning and invest- 
ment that goes into lists, usenet groups, etc. in the first place.

A second part is the dialog that's established between the moderators and 
the administrators. We deal with someone at AOL; there's a contract. 
There was an informal contract at Jefferson with Spoons, and between me 
and Spoons, and it was the informality that led to the list leaving 
Spoons, since manipulation became the only way things were done. Spoons' 
lack of contract with Jefferson is also problematic. On AOL, there's no 
manipulation and no content difficulties; we renegotiate the site after a 
year.

A third part is the work that moderators put into the list and the reason 
that they do this. At the moment, I don't do all that much; Pip is 
handling most of the admin until Sunday. But the admin can get heavy, and 
there is constant advertising, as well as participating in a listserv 
list and an AOL listserv list. The latter in fact is critical.

The criticality forms the fourth part - we tend to get information through
admin of potential trouble-seekers before things happen. Certain sites for
example have been banned from AOL; other sites were banned from Spoons.
Banning a site is serious, but there have been breaches, problems, created
by sysadmins for example. Most of the time there's complete cooperation.

Finally, there is the frame to the list itself which forms the fifth 
component from the viewpoint of the framing-device/framework. Majordomo 
and listserv are entirely different. You would be amazed at the number of 
controls/options which can be set - I would advise anyone studying lists 
to examine the listowners' manual which runs to over 100 pages if it were 
in print. It's constantly being updated. It's harder to get information 
on Majordomo, but there are FAQs available as well.

All of these play a role, mostly invisible, in the running of any list. 
All of them (reading the manual, participating in the other lists, etc.) 
take time. For me, they also occupy considerable space on my Inbox; there 
was a one minute period about five weeks ago when 137 error messages came 
in. All this stuff has to be dealt with.

I'm sure there are things that I'm missing here. One thing I tend to do
now, by the way - when I look at say a MOO or a talker, I want to know
this stuff, the framing devices. I think it's difficult to understand the
interior content without this. For example, on a talker, I can .demote
people to lower categories for misbehaving, and as wizard on a MOO, I can
actually change their programming without their permission. I hadn't
realized any of this until I examined the codes. On a MOO also, by the
way, there are a number of categories, different colors, such as grey, to
indicate problematic users or sites, and a lot of the synchronous CMC
applications have built in filtering. Protection is elaborate and can be 
used or misused; I was victimized on a talker about five weeks ago (I 
wrote about this to the list, Dobie) by someone clearly listening in to 
Paula Davidson's and my conversation - someone who was not present and 
should not have had listening privileges. 

Finally, finally, for a simple list of all user commands on listserv you 
can send to listserv@listserv.aol.com and say info refcard in the text of 
the message.

Subject: Governance ii

Another and final final final point - as moderators, Pip and I get 
notices every time someone signs on or off the list; by reviewing the 
list periodically, we keep track of total numbers. And people write to us 
(at least to me) complaining about various things, and then possibly 
leaving - in other words, we tend to be near what you might call the 
"temperature" of the list, particularly in regard to lurkers who might 
not say something in public, or in regard to friends who want us to 
know something that they wouldn't post publicly. The last is part of what 
I call the "list aura" which I think is prevalent on and around every 
list - the back-door communications among members that include everything 
from email to MOO meets to fleshmeets, etc. - some of which are publi- 
cized (the meetings) and some of which aren't.

Outline of earlier work


The following outline, from my 1990 work, still relates strongly to the
writing I have been doing on emergence, the uncanny, and so forth. Al-
though it's almost completely obscure in this context, I still thought it
might be of interest here. The primary structure relates to basic catego-
ries of the world; the secondary structure to their inscription. Both
interpenetrate the other. Both emphasize creativity at the heart of the
real, thresholding, and so forth. The "level of the social" references
issues of identity, the body, and so forth.

(This, a text on modeling for a photographer, is the last of the scanned
and stuttered texts that I will send; again, the body of the text is
necessary and evident - as is the imaginary which infuses the photogra-
phic session, not unlike that of cyberspace. what the camera "captures" 
is a form of embodiment, a mutual construct. It's not, today, that 
photography lies or doesn't lie - it's that it's losing its tether to 
epistemology altogether, at the last in terms of doxa. 1988, published.)


I MODEL FOR YOU


Modelling proceeds from the assumption that repesen tation possesses the
residue of organism, that something remams of interest afler the
photographic session occurs

Modelling also proceeds of course from the presence of the body its
posnion relative to the you, a position occasioned tom your establishment
of a structure Thus it IS only the presence of the body, ftis presence of
this body: an issue of ontology

What could emerge but a psycho or sexual pathology, a chanacterology
rendered immanent and inauthentic by an atmosphene of fiction and hysteric
reduction? E Something akin to Schizophrenia, perhaps the oterdeter-
mination ê! pecsonalrly. Thus a situation in which the spectator is mad,
held in abeyance it is the gaze of the model towards the spectator not the
other way around. 

From this moment on, the completion of the image and as pnesentazon, all
ot the usual issues occur: male and female gaze punctum, etc. But these
are not necessanly inhenent in the modelling session itself which contains
its own modes at representations, con bnually ptaymg off the deployment of
power and sex- uality within a situation as-d, a situation set aside as
the dream is always elsewhere

Ann so my body is an innmanent tornn at exchange; tot you it is a rite at
passage tNere e not ten the inertia at sesuai\ty, the weught at Abe r
aress at l\ghS, cay body would become irbtstbb, totaizeo: nothing and
everything r stmuhaneoustY. tts wsitsithy tot you wouxo be as by tox
myssit at course. 

I am always concerned about the revelation o the sex-; ual organs which
transform the body into a map, an area d stnations governed by the loges d
gesture (non- i distributive, non Boolean) and Transversals. For here is
whene Secrecy lies: here is where the get results in an ! annihilation
aldn to orgasm, a cincumscripbon d the hi body. At a certain point there
is nothing left to give at a certain moment in pornography the horizon d
death |, meets the totalizahon of organs, and so on. Thus I am y i Seduced
and this annihilation is my Comfort; I am ] become you and the session is
close to an end. I lose \ myself in substance the medieval substance ot
light just as pauv e Flaubert loses himself in materiality as Saina
Antoine before nescue by the Signifier ot the sun. Now the photograph is
not the signdier of the body and this absolute reduction is reversed only
by the oc- casion of time the closure of the shutter and the denouement of
the subsequent events m the studio. 

Compare this to the absundity of modelling tor a painter Here one nemains
hour arter hour in a useless posl- tion the pose (which originally had a
narnitive or i chanacterological content) becomes a dozen Signaler
reverbemting against the stillness of the body Nothmg pleasant in this
news tmm nowhene... 

While in photogniphy the pose is everything, andñ, everything prepares to;
n I take a pose and hold it for you; I release it the body moves through
the image i The image is imaginary, the body is always or the way I So
somewhere. (And when you take this picture, I love or hate you for in E am
never neutral . . )

         When I model I desine thou desine the photographer I
         ar d her performance desine this which targets my body, l
 repossesses it. It 1 am clothed, my body fulfills the i function of
clothing; d I am naked, everything is gone, devoured, spent. 

(Is there not a void between technology and body, bet- 
         ween Superstructure and base thnough which desire 
         flows, a mediation which transforms body into tantast? 
         What I desine is an extension of the world, its caress;
         what I desire is loss, and its desire).

         This is a form at gMng, this devouring. The posed body
         is the anorectic body, the body as absolute signifier,
         impenetrable, this is the body of exchange, the body
         d late capitalism in which commoddication and,
         tetishi2ation become one become the Same. The pure
         commodityñthe cohesive bodyñgathers light
         reproduces it as a form of abjedion. Abjedion, since
         light and body are no longer being and not being, See
         and not selt, neither one thing or another (the absent
         entity which exists on flhe temporal interstice d the shua-
         tershudder) the body becomes a re-presenlation, shod
         cincuiting the photographer and the everyday
         simultaneously Ongasm Sloths into the light; the self
         coagulates (a promise of coagulation) against the gnain
         of the negative the See Uevelops, l is hxed. annihilated
         Photography ar d modelling in particular are the inverted
         double of the body of the shaman, and the shaman
         is androgynous

         Thus photography itseh mediates between the real
         (evidence in the scientific sense) and the imaginary
         (the eccentric space of the emtic): an entity embed
         ded into substance or an entity promising substance
         and embedding.

If 1 perform for you, you are the proof. (You do me, do me in). I was this
way, that way I become you, your body your organs (the penetarion of
simultaneity, the absence of time). I don't think didnt think That slow
and deliberate movement I offer my body, Service. My arms, legs, torso,
thighs, everywhere. What I did was slow unlike me then frozen. The thing
flows; n flows; the image is impotent, discarded; what is the time of the
image? T me smears the image (which is completed by perception; wu
complete me). Nothing occurs when the shutter is open the shutter is all
that occurs. Nothing moves or is movement a representation?; the shutter
is all that moves. (What Barthes should nealize, that the punctum occurs
elsewhere, the real inversion of neal flesh occasioned by the photograph;
the image itself is just the residue). Arrangements, the absence of light,
our gins to each other

And this anonectic state is the pen ecf body; the residue is present or
absent, here or there digital. The shud- der of the session from the very
beginning is given purity as the horizon, the endless perfection of
withdrawal. And such withdrawal tends towands denoue- ment abjection,
towards that horizon which returns the everyday as absolute Thus the
everyday guarantees ab- jection I model for you in an hysteric state in
which time comes to an end My body and the body of the anonectic are

I desire you desire the pnesence of the camera. I desire your presence

So this is a case of theft and desire like sado- masochism, this is the
desire of the illicit granted by negotiation opening up a forbidden
interiority in which pesence is lost and gained. Just as I am always for
nant, you are always for hine. And this world, lost of late, lost of late
capitalism, is all the capital I have to spend. (So take it fast . . . the
