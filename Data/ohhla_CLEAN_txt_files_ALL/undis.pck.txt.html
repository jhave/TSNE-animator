Undisciplined kids don't cut it 
You gotta stay focused y'all niggaz don't cut it
Undisciplined kids don't cut it
You gotta stay focused y'all niggaz are hopeless 

[God's Gift]
Yo
You can't control your own soul so how you gonna roll against what god sent
I tip off rappers in honesty 
The irony is 
Harassing me is blasphemy
How you get the god a challenge when you off balance physically and spiritually 
I raise above the clouds in a hurry
But if you want me 
I'll just kick you down earthly
Now mostly I flows ufo styles cause the universe is our trial 
But I'm versital
I can't correct your style deflects the fect you rejects 
Might holt your freedom is my right to be righteous 
Not toxicated 
By toxic toxins I tox the skin 
With pure chase intentions 

[well who you be yo]

The rest oppress bills stress in the blood
The fresh in the flesh is gods gift unplugged 
The slaughter kids immoderate 
When I'm on the microphone you stop, look, and learn so you gets the most out of it
Direct from area fifty one 
Stomps on more techniques 
I freak the Madlib beats 
Wack styles get destroyed so you best believe when I rush MC's they can't avoid
When I bust that asteroid

So you're a gangsta cool but on the mic yo what's the difference 
Off the top can you drop rhythmatic metaphorical flows for instance 
Naw I didn't think so
You're just like all the floppy sloppy who like to kick back and copy 
Like you were Kinko's 
Sampling zap tracks 
Only reason why the crowd claps 
Covers up the fact your raps whack   
So I chill 
Wondering when the miracle will 
Bring it to your senses mentally and 
Physically bring out your lyrical skill 
Ha 
This common sense sell out ish     
You be devoted 
How it turned into a hit I don't know 
Why it gets promoted is where the concern lies 
And visine clears my eyes
So if you ever leave the country I suggest return wise 
Ha
In hip hop we don't stop to rock a joint 
So we point out whack emcees so rap audience sees my point 
Not the baddest nigga 
I never smoke but had a swigga 
I'm the thinnest one with lyrics that have the fattest figure 
Ha

Undisciplined kids don't cut it 
You gotta stay focused y'all niggaz don't cut it
Undisciplined kids don't cut it
You gotta stay focused y'all niggaz are hopeless

Undisciplined kids don't cut it 
You gotta stay focused y'all niggaz don't cut it
Undisciplined kids don't cut it
You gotta stay focused y'all niggaz are hopeless</pre>
