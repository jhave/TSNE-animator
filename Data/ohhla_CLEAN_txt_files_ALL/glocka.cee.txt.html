Brother... you've been on my mind
Oh brother
We've changed over time so
Brother, I'm keeping my eyes on you
I bet you don't think I know no bett'(er)
But sanging the blues
Oh but brother have I got news for you
I'm something... and I know you know that I'm something too
(chuckle)

Yeah, usually I don't get into all this battle rap shit and all that
Shit's stupid
But I'm gonna address it
And after I get it off my chest may God bless it
I will invest four minutes exactly for everyone who had the audacity to attack me

I kept quiet but perhaps I should have pushed this fire quicker
Cause to just sit with this shit I've only gotten sicker
Yet I react without even a crack in my composure
But the only way he knows to bring this shit to a closure
I'm worthy, and my associates and I named the South Dirty
And I'm even for sale in Braille, the deaf, dumb and blind have heard me
But I ain't even breathin until I get an even 30
I could casually clap up the front of somebody's throwback jersey
You makin' me hafta talk this way, aintcha?
You makin' me hafta talk this way
You forcin me to walk this way
Maybe my album will get bought this way
Niggaz slow down around me, I make em superstitious
And one of my vices used to be wanting to look visually vicious
But instead I use my head and I fed niggaz something nutritious
But you will appreiciate what a sacrifice this is
And I know you ambitious young men, you have my best wishes
Have a piece of this pain on a platter, it's one of my best dishes
When you assassinate my character, not one remark misses
So it's gone get funky when I'm fryin these little fishes
Fuck fakin, there has been some offense taken
But this itty bitty beef is, beneath me, like bacon
But hear me when when I say, I ain't gone hate you halfway
You know me, somebody will surely owe me
When it comes to respect, I only put my family before me
And the beat ridin, oh so slowly, but surely
And you in danger, and I'll be strict about straight erry one of you niggaz like strangers
I'll put bullet holes in anything that oppose
Through car doors and clothes, amateurs and pros
Hardhead niggaz and hoes, also friends and foes
Let it be known that you'll lose your life fucking around with Lo
This is my Glockapella
And I'll be wearing diamonds forever like I'm signed to Rocafella
And I'ma bust two times in the sky
Cause ain't nobody around here ready to die
But if there's more that you want, can't but one side win
And I'm damn sure ready to try mutha fucker, yeah
Hold on... haha I'm all off the mother fucking beat, hold on

Lo crazy, Lo a'hurt somebody bad
Lo crazy, Lo a'hurt somebody dad
Decide to ride down your street and just hurt somebody bad
You know, as in house, hurt somebody's child or somebody's spouse
You see what I'm saying, and you know I can be what I'm sayin
And I got the most to lose, but you steppin on my shoes, nigga
You become a target, and will remain a target until you are hit
You gone fuck around and found out that's Lo still down for it
I ain't scared of ya, never been scared of ya
If anyhing I'm scared for ya because I'm so ahead of ya
Take that to the head brother, before I walk up on your bed brother
And paint your blood in red brother
You heard what I said  brother?
Mutha fucker, hahaha
I ain't mad at these niggaz
Ahh, ahh I tricked you

(sang)
We got a real awful thang goin down, getting down
There's a whole lot of talkin going round
You best believe me before I pack up and move out of town
I will gladly gone and glock one of them down
I said, bring me the funk, I want the funk
I said, bring me the funk, give me the funk
I said bring me the funk, I can handle the funk
Just bring me the funk, bring me the funk
Mutha fucker</pre>
