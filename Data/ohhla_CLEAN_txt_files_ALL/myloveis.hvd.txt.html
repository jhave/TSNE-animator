[Chorus: Heavy D] (Background Singers)
My love is all I have for you (Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!)
Oooohhh! Girl no diamond rings (Diamond rings)
No expensive things (Expensive things)
No trips in spring (Oooh Oooh)
And my love is all I have for you (Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!)
See I'm not a wealthy man (Wealthy man)
I'm just an average man (Average man)
But I do what I can

[Verse One: Heavy D]
But when morning comes, your no longer alone
And when the evening brings me home to you 
Let's talk about your day! Did things go your way?
If not then let me comfort you
See, I'm offering, a lifetime, of love and tender care

Oooohhh! Girl no diamond rings (Diamond rings)
No expensive things (Expensive things)
No trips in spring (Oooh Oooh)
And my love is all I have for you (Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!)
See I'm not a wealthy man (Wealthy man)
I'm just an average man (Average man)
But I do what I can

[Verse Two: Heavy D]
Yeah! There might even be, some with more money than me
Yeah! But I lay down my life for you!
No I'm not able to, financially do for you
My heart belongs to you! Hey Hey! See girl!
I'm offering, a lifetime, of love and tender care

[Chorus: Heavy D] (Background Singers)
My love is all I have for you (Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!)
Oooohhh! Girl no diamond rings (Diamond rings)

[Bridge: Heavy D]
But see yah! Anyhow yuh love mi would a extra special
Anyhow yuh leave mi would a leave mi critical
