(Fading Echo)...Looks like rain..looks like rain...looks like rain

[Verse 1]
Sittin' down in my crackhouse earnin' my pay
It's the southwest juggla claimin' Delray
Violent J, known by the gang squad and police alike
I'm known to get wrong off the get right
Hangin' at the truck I load a mausburg off
Who the head of your set I blow your boss shirt off
I be the top dark killa, Who da bomb don
ya soft like a bon-bon in ya Sean John
I'm ridin' dirrtay, up and down in a ford escort
I'm in a "Ring Master" gold super sport
And it's about to rain, I see the weather bad
hit the top on up like I better had
I cut back to the cut to get a cut of my cut
Cuz even in a hurricane a crack head'll show up
I'll be the gang tag kayer, gay fag slayer
bag weigher with a sweet street sweep A.K'er
I don't care

[Hook 2x]
I like the darkness
Its bout to helly flow (It poors)
Tornado sirens
Let it rain..Wicket shit

[Verse 2]
Its boring man, I'm smoking a blunt
Its pouring rain the hood soaking it up
But its gettin' kinda windy and the walls are shaking
Fuckin' roofs coming off, I'm in a laz-y-boy bakin'
I see the crack heads tryna' reach the porch
But the wind sweep 'em off before they get to the door
They only 90 pounds, Grab something held down
cuz you lookin' funny flying around..fag
Blunt wrap on my lap ass all over me
Playing Nintendo "Mega Man 4" from '93
Shutters are shaking and the lighting is frightening
Fuckin' windows are breaking, man I'm thinking it might be
A tornado, go to the door open it up...(*door creaking open*)...yup
All the same back to my game its all right
As long as that motherfucker stay outside I'm tight

[Hook 2x]
I like the darkness
Its bout to helly flow
Tornado sirens
Let it rain..Wicket shit

[Verse 3]
Holy fuckin' shit what the fuck is happilatin'
The whole house spinning and shaking damn near breaking in half
I take it and laugh cuz what the fuck can I do
I put the rocks in my sock so I don't lose them to
I'm fuckin hangin' out, I lost all but my drawers
Somehow my game still good chillin' on pause
We airborne and the windows flying
Passin' by are crack heads wavin' at me still tryina buy
Mailboxes, a pizza man, some garbage cans
then I seen a naked ass bitch like.....Damn!
There was all kinda crazy shit caught in the storm
But before long all the shit was gone (*screams...a loud bang*)</pre>
