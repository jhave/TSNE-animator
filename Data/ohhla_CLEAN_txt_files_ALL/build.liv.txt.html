Yo Kris.. yo, where that shit at yo?
That ol' ill shit

[Verse One]
I'm buildin foundations like a mason, I rock
The texture of my architecture connects the dots
It's the blueprints of sense, {?} submit
Rough and rugged so yo fuck it, my armor can't get dent
But technical, yo, I got mad precision
I'm wired like 'lectricians, got wind like air conditioners
My position is the foreman, I got more in store man
I know you dig this shit so stop frontin like the doorman
Now back to the schematic, get dramatic with the scene
Hittin nails on the head, like a carpenter with beams
Yo this ain't no dream, so don't sleep or slumber
I make the fluid flow like a motherfuckin plumber
Other rappers just get dumber, I just get smarter
She rock from the start, to make my lyrics harder
I reveal the deal so I'm somethin like a revelator
If it's over your head get your ass on the elevator

[Verse Two]
I build constructions of skills for destruction
Breakin through walls like wreckin balls
Demolition is the mission, you're facin
Whack motherfuckers need renovation - so face facts
I'm harder than hardhats, I jack like a forklift brain
I'm penetratin brainframes, with the truth as my jackhammer
Check the grammar, collapse ya structure
Surroundin and blockin off suckers
Like barricades, I'm blowin up like the World Trade
My center, it reads danger, don't enter
Down with {?} like a build and destructin
You're crumblin, while you're mumblin, sayin nothin
A structure's only strong as the frame
My knowledge is light, so I build to maintain
The levels of my impact smothers your conciousness
I wreck buildings cause I'm lyrically EXPLOSIVE
