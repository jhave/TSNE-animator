Ja Rule, O1

[Ja Rule] 
Yeah
It's our world, please believe
Niggas ain't real, please believe
It's murda, please believe
I-N-C niggas what's fucking with me?

That's the rule please niggas don't get it confused
See this game that we playing, y'all playing to lose
Who's next that wanna ride (who)
Spitting (who) how I do niggas (who?) knowin they wanna ride (who)
Rule baby, I've been really outta control lately
If you relating let me hear ya say yea-yaay yea-yaay
Y'all feeling my pain? I've been running wild time and again
Y'all swerve in my lane, I'll pull up and start popping ya brain
Fuck knowin' these broads names, extravengant champagne
Y'all niggas is lame, my niggas ain't sane 
Who you fuckin' with?

[Chorus: Ja Rule, O1, Vita] 
Ya'll niggas wanna dead (who)

Ya'll know the niggas that be steady screaming (fuck you)
It's murda murda, you know it's murda murda
We live it, we breathe it, we screaming murda murda murda

[Ja Rule]
Murder Inc is my blood 
We go through the pain together by any means
Popping it hot at whoever or so it seems
Niggas that getting hot not this hot nigga very hot
See it in your eyes niggas ready to die
But as long as I'm alive I'm putting this on my life
For niggas that ain't right they get it upon sight
If ya know me then you know we pop away
Cock and pop again baby, men will be men
I spit off 10 fuck it give 'em the 16
Like my guns dirty and hands clean 
Loose bitches in tight jeans
Old money and crack fiends was a fetish 
Before Guliani got into office and deaded shit
Fuck it I'm living my life on the edge
Got one in the head plus a nigga's fed 'nuff said
I'm gonna behead niggas that don't believe this
Rule baby, 3:36

[Chorus]

[O1] 
We are the world's most dangerous niggas alive
All of my niggas bang with us and let's ride
Muthafuckas will war but not many survive
Cuz 50 shots tearing through the side of ya ride
Cuz we are (murderers)
Muthafucka you heard player (murderers)
Popping collars in air
Popping shots through ya rearview
Bullets, they tear through
Got niggas wondering like "What the fuck did I do?"
So niggas wanna go and get they man cuz they can't do this shit
Because they ain't got no heart for this, bust a gun and body shit
Niggas like you probably snitch, do a nigga then get rich
Niggas like you always fit 6 feet deep inside a ditch
There ain't nothing fucking with this ya know why?
Nigga I just came into the game ready to die
Ready to hold heat, drive-by with Rule
Popping shots through the sun roof screaming "fuck you"

[Chorus]</pre>
