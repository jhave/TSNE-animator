Well they done put you on a track with a well known trap and
(Hell, I'm well known myself so I might as well trap withcha)
Shit can get crazy dawg, I hope you brought your strap withcha

Well they done put you on a track with a well known trap and
(Hell, I'm well known myself so I might as well trap withcha)
Shit can get crazy dawg, I hope you brought your strap withcha
(I'm a cap peelin crack dealer, this ain't just no rap nigga)

[Jody Breeze] + (Young Jeezy)
Well first of all, I'm that nigga that's moving that work for y'all
I'm the one you call who got it all, X, dro, par, salt
I gotta get it now nigga and don't count on cost
Cause the way I'm feelin nigga, I wanna take it all
(Fa Real Shawty) What Up Nigga? (Pump your breaks, slow your roll dude)
What? (If you want the real money, you gotta lose the attitude
Nigga, what type of shit is you on
Don't be talkin all god damn reckless on my phone)
Well I'm just saying though, I'm just telling you what I stand for
We both grown men so just gimme what I ask for
I never asked your ass for a half of
Nothing, cause I already have what they ask for
(Your mouth too fly dawg, Plus your numbers too high dawg
So why even try dawg, I'm getting money, you just getting by dawg)
Whatchu mean nigga? I fuck hoes too
My niggaz bringing them bummas in truck loads too
Yea, I ain't but 19 nigga but I'm no joke
Ain't nann no nigga try to fuck me cause I know coke
(Believe that bullshit if you wanna
Word boy, I shot at em and they hotter than a sauna
And watch your tone, we gonna be heard
And one more thing, don't ever use that c-word)
Ay, come on man, I'm from the West Side
I think you already know that we on it man
We getting dough boy, we moving blow boy
And we's hotter than the stove in 94 boy
(Ay, that might be true
But I ain't worried bout them, I'm trying to help you
It ain't about whose damn bread is longest
It's about who can stay out on these streets the longest
Ay, cause one slip and you outta here
Won't be back til them damn Duck Dodgers years)
I tell you what? Gimme what you think I outta have
Watch how I have them fiends asking for your autograph
