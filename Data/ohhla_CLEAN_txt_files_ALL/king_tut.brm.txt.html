Yo Yo! See the way I takeover casinos like Dinero said

And my cup a runneth over like a fuckin water fountain
Any nigga try to front, I'm a show 'em shit get ugly 
Throwin bread until they jealous and they money lookin funny
Hold up!!!! And body shit that's what a monster do
See me throwin this money your bitch is like a sponsor do
Put the gloves on and beat up a nigga like I'm Kostya Tszyu
And fuck the talkin just bring me my money like a prostitute

Ok I'm ridin through yo' city blowin ditties of that icky
Got yo' wifey in the passenger I'm ridin as she lick me
I get money like my cuban (Cuban) You know my bank is heavy
And I rep that 31 like Jason Terry when I'm shootin 
ATM in my jeans bank sittin on my left thigh
Burn a mansion down watch it coverin my Left Eye
Girl on deck, I just split another lick
Now my trap look like black friday 12AM in front of Best Buy
Ha Ha! Sour got me all sedated 
Niggas lookin at me angry what's with all the smiley faces?!
My dinero like Shapiro I see Johnny Cochran wages
I'm no lawyer but they only bring them bottles by the cases

[Verse Three: J Doe]
Uh, okay now stupid-ass stacks in my pocket (yah!)
Test me, best be faster than a rocket (yah~!)
I ain't got no time if it ain't about a profit (uh-uh)
If you send me my deposit, I will have yo' city rockin (OH!)
I get the hottest beats, niggas wish that they could rhyme on it (rhyme on it)
I got the hottest watch, ain't even set the time on it (time on it)
The way I'm killin niggas, it look like a crime, don't it?
I got the Light, with a little bit of lime on it
Okay, now stupid ass stacks in my pocket
Whip clean, jet ski attached to the Charger
Bitches want attention and I tell 'em try harder
Got 'em doin shit I know that's gon' be disgracin they father
O-O-Okay, le'go

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
They got nerve lil' nigga (HEY!) See me when I pull up to the curve lil' nigga (OWWWWW!!!!!)
