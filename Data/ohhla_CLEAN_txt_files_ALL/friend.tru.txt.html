[Master P]
Check this out boo
The only thing that matters is if you happy and I'm happy
You know what I'm saying?
We know this real ghetto love
After the fronting and fighting, 
that's where the love making begins real good baby
But our friends aint our friends
your mama in our businessn your sister in our business
the media in our business
these motherfuckers don't understand

Chorus: (Charlie Wilson)

You said your a friend of mine, it turned out you crossed the line
I forgive you I don't know why, you said your a friend of mine
You said your a friend of mine, it turned out to be a lie
I forgive you I don't know why, you said your a friend of mine

[Master P]
Call the cops for nothing, all the jumping and stunting
It should be kissing and hugging, I mean loving and rubbing
I'm on your team, your on my team, I'm your king, you my queen
I'm the ice you the cream, but your friends love the scheme
Even I told you you was special, see these hoes will sweat you
The niggas will wet you, but the ghetto is pressure
No more fighting in front of the kids, it's time to live big
Build a family tree of figs, and let the haters dig
You my rose I'm your flower, I think about you ever hour
Keep them hoes out our business if you need me just holla

Chorus: (Charlie Wilson)

You said your a friend of mine, it turned out you crossed the line
I forgive you I don't know why, you said your a friend of mine
You said your a friend of mine, it turned out to be a lie
I forgive you I don't know why, you said your a friend of mine

[Snoop Dogg]
I tell you all my problems, share my deepest secrets with ya
Hit ya on the side, girl you down to ride
I feel so safe with ya, get cha what you need
A condo in the valley with the keys, palm trees, jet skies
Fly you over seas, it's silly how we did it
Really we commited
I'm dippin out the studio with the too faking 
My heart just uh aching, while I'm shaking and snaking
You tell me take a chance so I dance with the devil
I kiss you on the cheek, and now we sneak into the bedroom
Tossing and turning, burning, yearning for love
And you supposed to be in love with my young cuz
What's love got to do with this?, and it's all based on friendship
Ain't that twisted, somebody told my boo and I think it was you
Had to be cause I aint heard from you or seen you, so it must be true

Chorus: (Charlie Wilson)

You said your a friend of mine, it turned out you crossed the line
I forgive you I don't know why, you said your a friend of mine
You said your a friend of mine, it turned out to be a lie
I forgive you I don't know why, you said your a friend of mine
You said your a friend of mine, it turned out to be a lie
I forgive you I don't know why, you said your a friend of mine
You said your a friend of mine, it turned out to be a lie
I forgive you I don't know why, you said your a friend of mine</pre>
