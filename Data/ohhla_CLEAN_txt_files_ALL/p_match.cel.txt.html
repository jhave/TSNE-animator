[ *scratched* ]
"Hey"

[ CHORUS: Baybe ]
Perfect combination
Ain't no other relationship
Like this
I know we're gonna last forever

[ Phantasm ]
At the edge of my bed I sit back and reminisce
Long talks and walks and also your soft kiss
We went shopping at Macy's, skating at Lacey's
Cut off all my dime pieces, even thick Stacey
Thinkin in this rental blastin instrumentals
How we first met was all on my mental
It was at Great Adventure, the 'Batman Ride'
Thought I was deaded cause first this fat man tried
The sun, beamin, federation schemin
But you was clockin DiBiase, musta been day-dreamin
Waitin on line, wishin she was all mine
Shootin the gift, exchanged digits, the whole nine
Spent about 850 in Atlantic City
After you, boo, my attitude is real sh..
[ U.G. ]
Scenery sunny, act one, near a money machine
Jumped out the cream Lex with Jacks, she rocked a black tennis skirt
With Stan Smith's, about a size 6
Jewels, chinky eyes, long hair, bow legged, her thighs
Was thick like she ran track, for what it's worth
Shortie was made from the best things on this Earth
Like a Snapple I wanted to drink her to quench my thirst
Jumped in the coupe and threw my joint in reverse
Hey boo, I was watchin you (I was watchin you)
Here's my number (true) call me at the crib at 2

[ CHORUS ]

[ Phantasm ]
Hey yo, tell me what went wrong to make me write this song
Used to have it going on, our feelings was so strong
Your age 26, my number one draft pick
From all the rest, got first dibs plus your own crib
You just flew back in town (from where, son?) from Dallas
And said she wants the Tall Man to come to her palace
I'm over there tonight to watch the Bulls catch licks
From the Knicks and at halftime I watch Rod Strick's
Get bizzynizm, I feel lucky to shoot the gizm
In her triangular prism, and that's the realism
(Where does she live, kid?) Out in Bed-Stuy
(Do-or-Die?) come on now, baby, cause I'm packin
[ U.G. ]
I got the phone call at 2 (it's me, boo) - oh
She said (you know, why don't you come to the crib-o?
We could wine and dine and relax on the low
And drink Mo, by the way, I just saw your video)
Yeah, true, I'm comin through, give me a hour
Jumped out the shower and buried my body in baby powder
Dipped wears plus my hair smells like Nexus
(Oo-oo-oo) Yo, I jump into the Lexus
On the highway, it's a Friday, can't wait to see her
I picked up two slices from the local pizzeria

[ CHORUS ]

[ Phantasm ]
Got to the crib about 8, she told me wait in the living room
Be back real soon, on HBO tonight is _Platoon_
Laid back in this recliner, sex on my minder
Playin Pitty Pat watchin _Fritz the Cat_
[ U.G. ]
Whip in the drive-way and do wanna club, playin Nas 'One Love'
Drinkin O.E., she told me her address was double 0-3
I slowly walked up the steps and rung her back bell
Talkin on my cell
[ Phantasm ]
I skated to the back, I see Black Knights and smell Fahrenheit
That's when shortie took flight
[ U.G. ]
What's the deal, fam? What's the real plan, shortie flashed
Knockin over trash like she was runnin a 40 yard dash
Let's hit the club and start from scratch
Cause all I wanted us to be was the perfect match
