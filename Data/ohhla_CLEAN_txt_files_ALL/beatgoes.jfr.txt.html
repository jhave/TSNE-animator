[Chorus Tra-Knox and (Will Smith)]
It's all night, and it's all right, 'til the sunlight
(This is how da beat goes on)
Big Will, Tra-Knox, so hot
(This is how da beat goes on)
Poppin, rockin, and stompin
(This is how da beat goes on)
Big Will, Tra-Knox, so hot
(This is how da beat goes on)

(Verse 1 - Will Smith)
It's the bizzi, wizza, jizzi, Wizzil
Bizon, wizzay, Wizzat, fizzil
Back again but with a couple of friends
Thought my reign would end, well now I'm rubbin it in
I'm back yes, yes yallin', back again ballin
Out for a couple of years thought I had fallen
You seen me with Denzel and Russ Crowe
But yo the movies just a chick on the side I'm in love with the flow
Time off to be an Oscar nominee now
Back to the M-I-C to MC now
Rockin the ol' heads blazing the youth
Only rapper had the president raising the roof
Check the tape, checkmate, it's one mission
Make your move, don't fight submission
To dawn to dusk, we on a trust
Just don't miss the bus, to jam on with us, come on

[Chorus Tra-Knox and (Will Smith)]
It's all night, and it's all right, 'til the sunlight
(This is how da beat goes on)
Big Will, Tra-Knox, so hot
(This is how da beat goes on)
Poppin, rockin, and stompin
(This is how da beat goes on)
Big Will, Tra-Knox, so hot
(This is how da beat goes on)

(Verse 2 - Will Smith)
This is, how the
Beat goes on and on and on and
Me and Tra-Knox keep keepin it on and
Jokers ain't stoppin' 'til the mornin', so

(Tra-Knox)
Every, everybody come feel this
This union, this spirit
Created from the soul, oh yeah
It's big Will (Who else)
And Tra-Knox keepin it real
Tearing up the club
We got what you want
So you cannot front
Everybody get on the floor

(Will Smith)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, we ain't stoppin 'til the mornin
Me and Tra-Knox keep, keepin it on and (We keep, keepin' it on and)

[Chorus Tra-Knox and (Will Smith)]
It's all night, and it's all right, 'til the sunlight
(This is how da beat goes on)
Big Will, Tra-Knox, so hot
(This is how da beat goes on)
Poppin, rockin, and stompin
(This is how da beat goes on)
Big Will, Tra-Knox, so hot
(This is how da beat goes on)

(Verse 3 - Will Smith)
A hip hop superhero, a widow, cape or a suit
Hit the studio every year or so, and escape with the loot
On my down time straight to the links
I could pack a dance floor, a movie theatre or truck from brinks
On Christmas, mom and wife douse 'em with ice
AOL, search will smith thousands of sites
And at the club, hands clappin' toes tappin'
Sucka I'm the greatest thing ever happen to rappin'
Best shape of my life destined to show ya
No scrapes or fender benders lead the game total
Free, don't move hip hop mogul
Philly ain't happy I, I be the guy to go
The guy to go, you know the go to guy
The mega man that got the whole crew like
Damn Will den done did it again
He done stepped up to the plate and he done hit it again
Yo get them hands up

(Tra-Knox)
Throw your hands up
Wave 'em like you don't care
You like the sound then
Then let me hear you say

[Chorus Tra-Knox and (Will Smith)]
It's all night, and it's all right, 'til the sunlight
(This is how da beat goes on)
Big Will, Tra-Knox, so hot
(This is how da beat goes on)
Poppin, rockin, and stompin
(This is how da beat goes on)
Big Will, Tra-Knox, so hot
(This is how da beat goes on)</pre>
