Song:   End Up Here
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Boy I was watching you move
Sorta checking you out
Loving what you do boy we oughta paint the town
You can watch me get to it double roll and lean
Make up your mind if you're liking what you see
Don't' want no flowers, don't buy me no gifts
I need somebody who can take care of this
I'm loving what you do cause I know you do it well
You got your game tight real smart I can tell

[Chorus]
Please don't play that usual game
The type to put out your flame
I-I-I, I dont want to shed a tear
I-I-I, I didn't want to end up here
Could you gimme that dust
That you throw right 'round
Give me that stuff make you wanna get down
I I I I didn't wanna end up here

Yeah I went through your phone and didn't like what I've seen
You promised you'd be true, you made a fool out of me
My friends tried to warn me that I'd waste my time
I saw your true colours almost lost my mind
Looks like you do the same to all your other girls
Except you bought her flowers and you bought me pearls
When you're going out tonight I know you're seeing her again
Saw your picture together, so now you're kissing all your friends

[Chorus]
Oh Please don't play that usual game (that usual games)
The type to put out your flame
I-I-I, I don't want to shed a tear
I-I-I, I didn't want to end up here
Could you gimme that dust
That you throw right 'round
Gimme that stuff make you wanna get down
I-I-I, I didn't want to end up here

If I don't leave right now
Will my wounds still open
Slipped right through your hands
Now my heart is broken
I'm moving on yeah yeah
I'm moving on yeah yeah
I'm moving on yeah yeah
I'm moving on

[Chorus]
I-I-I, I don't want to shed a tear (I don't wanna shed a tear)
I-I-I, I didn't want to end up here (Didn't wanna end up)
Could you gimme that dust
That you throw right 'round
Gimme that stuff make you wanna get down
I-I-I, I didn't want to end up here</pre>
