Yo motherfucker
What the fuck you lookin at?
Yo, get out my motherfuckin face right now

Yo man, trip this
I was out on the ave man
This nigga lookin at me wrong
So I pulled out my motherfuckin nine
And I SMOKED HIS ASS

Woke up, didn't choke up
Saw my AK, it was broke up
Put it together like a jigsaw
Got my nine, and my Rambo knife off the floor
Went to the bathroom, and beat the rush
Yo, who the fuck used my toothbrush?
Went to my sister's room, yo bitch, wake up
You stupid ass, dirty ass, nasty ass slut
Shot her in the leg, shot her in the thigh
Kick her in the pussy and punched her in the eye
Slapped her in the head, stepped on her corns
Don't fuck with mine bitch, word is born
Went downstairs to eat wit my folks
Ma, you broke my fuckin egg yoke!
Punch her in the chest, cut on her cheek
Then I did a sweep, knocked the bitch off her feet
Knee to the pussy, kick to the skull
AK yo I shot the bitch in the temple
Pops got mad cause mom got licked
I didn't give a fuck so I shot him in the dick
Hungry as fuck, said my grace
Pop kept screamin so I shot him in the face
Ate my food, found my coat
Mailman came so I cut his motherfuckin throat
Waitin for the motherfuckin school bus!!

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo Dres, yo Dres
Wake up man, wake up 
What's wrong with you man
Yo, I had a horrible, fuckin dream man
What the fuck was the dream about G?
I dreamed that I was.. hard</pre>
