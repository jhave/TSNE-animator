Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm... Screaming fuck them niggaz who hated
I'm money affiliated
Speculated me landing, musta got me mistaken with lame niggaz
Know you gon get high as fuck as long as the planes with ya
Let that major situation lone and became richer
People talking down, but see me I'm the same nigga
Leave ya bitch around, we gon drink the champagne with her
We don't touch the ground, See a cloud with my name in it
Only easy riders squeeze no cigars for me and my gang
Fool I'm a legend in dese streets, that's how I do my thang
And don't wear the fitted, I got the city on my chain
Arr man... Still they hated talk smack knowing if I was gone, there'll be no throne to throw ya rocks at
Cruising maximum altitudes, I'm tyrna top that
So in touch with the real, them suckas tyrna stop that
But I... Live or laugh die, Party get high and tell dem lames to the plane and let fly

Don't know what they hatin for, Just getting my paper
Well Maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone
I don't wanna leave but I need to
It's Such A Shame(shame)... They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane)
They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane)... They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane)
They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane) I tried to believe you, I don't wanna leave but I need to

Uh... Stuck alone in this way of grace
Say I'm living too fast, don't plan on changing my pace
Got one foot on the gas, It's neva in need for brakes
Smoke easy riders with hash, Fuck bitches from outta state
Valet bringing my cars, a waiter to bring me plates
Shrimp and Filet Mignon, We celebrate buyin drinks
With a couple of broads, my niggaz and who got love for me
It's lonely at the top, I'm tired of having company
So while you busy tyrna fit in, I'm a stand out
And view my life thru this lens and see how it pans out
Substitute teacher ass niggaz need a handout
Middle finger screaming fuck dem niggaz who hated
I'm money affiliated
Pop another bottle that chronic smokin degraded
Speculating me landin, musta got me mistaken
I'm speaking as the captain of the plane
You'sa runner on the jet way

Don't know what they hatin for, Just getting my paper
Well Maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone
I don't wanna leave but I need to
It's Such A Shame(shame)... They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane)
They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane)... They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane)
They Gon Miss This Plane(Plane) I tried to believe you, I don't wanna leave but I need to</pre>
