My my my teacher came in class, breathin hard as could be
And then she made a pass at my homeboy D
I said she's movin fast, she's lookin at me
MISS ELAINE!

She's a crazy lady, she may be insane
She always call me baby, but that's not my name
Hey those kisses that she gave me, I just can't explain
MISS ELAINE!

	MISS ELAINE!  WAS HER NAME!
	MISS ELAINE!  WAS HER NAME!

She walked into the class with an aim for the day
Elaine had a game and I was willing to play
She said if I was down, she'd give me an A
MISS ELAINE!

Yo, my class is breakin fool, she sent them all home
She kept me after school, yeah me all alone
I follow all the rules, but I should have known
MISS ELAINE!

	MISS ELAINE!  WAS HER NAME!
	MISS ELAINE!  WAS HER NAME!

Ahhhhhhhh...
{*guitar solo*}

Try to go to school, keep my head on the books
My teacher's kinda cool, give the dirtiest looks
All my friends want a hook-up, but nobody hooks
MISS ELAINE!

Yo, I go for what I know, and I get what I get
It's gettin rather frantic, people say I'm a pet
She's makin me a winner and I'm glad that I met
MISS ELAINE!

	MISS ELAINE!  WAS HER NAME!
	M_M_M_M_M_MISS ELAINE!  MISS ELAINE!

Ahhhhhhh, make it funky now</pre>
