(Snoop Talkin)

Yeah 
Alot of people always ask me ...
Snoop Dogg  ... What it feel like being on No Limit Records ? 
How that nigga P treat you ?
What C-Murder and Silkk the Shocker like ? 

Nigga let me tell ya somethin 

{Snoop Dogg}

Fancy cars, big ole rings
Pushin the dope and I don't mean cocaine
No pain, no game I struggle for mine 
I hustle for mine and that's all the time 
I b-ball wit P, C, Silkk and Serv
Went to my homies from the CP Third
Southside niggas on the west coast curves
We givin up love, while we blazin up bud
How yall fell about that No Limit shit ?
Big Snoop Dogg you know we rock that shit 
Well put on yo jersey and yo mothafuckin tank
And show yo golds and crack some hoes 
We closin down shop but the game be sold 
Imma have money even when I'm old
&gt;From a G to key when u fuckin wit P 
Somehow someway got to get the money 

Chorus  (Snoop Dogg) 

Hell yeah it's a beautiful thing 
Yeah yall it's a beautiful thing
No Limit it's a beautiful thing 
Yeah yall it's a beautiful thing (TRU, TRU)  ( Can yall dig it ?)
Yeah yall it's a beautiful thing
TRU it's a beautiful thing
No Limit it's a beautiful thing

{C-Murder }

Me and my nigga Snoop shootin dice lookin fo cheese (for keys)

And like Roy we totin them plastic toys

What yall thank nigga ? It's a beautiful thang
