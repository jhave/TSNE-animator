Chorus:
Venom over here, Venom over there
Venom, Venom over there
Venom be like in your presents everywhere

[Finesse]
Throw ya middle fingers up
For all my homies laying in tha cut
Now let me see you get bucked

[N-Tyce]
Venom over here, Venom over there
Venom, Venom over where?
Venom be like in your presents everywhere

[Finesse]
A yeah, the front stops here
All you rap bitches hit the rear
It's show time, watch me end bitches career
Thorough bread, chicks on the rise
I'm the thugged out venom, smack the fire out ya eyes

[N-Tyce]
Yo there's a war going on outside, we gone escape from
I only ask you respect where I came from
N'Tyce, Hush Hush chick, I be the same one
Now I think it's time that we show you how the game done
Why can't it be so simple?
I used to be the cute kid wit dimples
Now this game is playing wit my mental
Could it be that? To busy trying to wonder where the weed at
Focus more on where you plant the seeds at

[J-Boo]
Yeah believe that, Venom number 3, where the weed at?
Yo, let me see that, yo let me hold something homie
Come on spread love, smoke that L if you wanna know me
Then I'm gonna do you, like ya name was Roman
Of course get wild on, watch my style flow from Cali to NY City
See my thugs pretty?
Them niggas wanting to suck a titty, down wit tha Venom committee 
But we ain't rolling if you shitty
Nigga it'll take one in a fifty, me and my bitches is so gritty
We wanna take you on a bitty, you and my whole crew
Like you suppose to, come here get close to
I wanna introduce you to my kitty

[Champ MC]
A yo, I'm tried of being broke
A yo, I'm tried of puffing the same smoke, 
you testing me I'm not joke
Champ, the rap slayer, slap you in ya face wit some flavor
Let you know the dilly, I was a woman before you became a willy
Have you banging like Billy
Then be splitting bitches straight to ya belly

[Finesse]
Yo, yo, heavy on the war zone, all my chicks stand alone
I see you formulating but you only a clone
We regulating, while you stay imitating (What)
We giving birth while you still ovulating
Perpetrating, my crew be vet's in the game
I wonder why y'all thought y'all could game from my fame
We drop the bomb, now it's time to reload
We keep on moving while ya shit was put on hold

[N-Tyce]
Yo time keep on ticking
Everything we drop banging and hitting
Wonder why labels keep they artist sitting
Lucky for fans though, they never forgetting
Everything spoken was written
Black magic, abracadabra
My crew a grab ya, and have you wide open like a crack pipe
Niggas better act right
It's kinda dark but I'm about to make you see like a flashlight

[J-Boo]
Yeah, tha shit is ludicrous like, Mike Tyson would say
How the Venom slithered through ya town, fucked up ya day
Had you working for free wit no pay
In ya presents who we rocking shit wit no delay
Hear what I say?  We the knock out queens
Crushing ya walls, my bitches get down and dirty
At 12:30 time to pull, got these niggas tricking
These bitches so tired and sicking
And the DJ feel so horny that he wanna stick his dick in

[Champ MC]
Be cautious, kick shit that make you nausea 
Keep stacking, looking sweet up in the Porsches
Keep packing, end ya life like abortion
Game tight like a Trojan, nigga poison
Attack, ready for combat, listen all black
Wit my knapsack where benji be at
In this industry, fuck nah, never rock for free
Watch my name go down in history
When I'm gone, like Biggie you'll be missing me

[J-Boo]
Where you at Deadly Venom holla back?

Chorus:
[N-Tyce]
Venom over here, Venom over there
Venom, Venom over there
Venom be like in your presents everywhere

[Finesse]
Throw ya middle fingers up
For all my homies laying in tha cut
Now let me see you get bucked

[Finesse]
Yo step back, fuck the feed back
Verbal combat, we go to war on this track
It's air tight, you wanna shine, you gotta fight
It ain't enough room for you to share the spotlight
Four chicks, four styles we all vary
Deadly Venom, Rocks The Word, it's real scary

[N'Tyce]
Yeah, stop, look, take a listen
My style is nasty like cousins kissing (Ewww)
We like a team everybody play in positions
I be the quarterback (Touchdown)
I be the one you leave a message for but never calling back
I heard you down with a clique, they be calling wack
Yeah we about to make a bomb threat, yeah bomb attack

[J-Boo]
I be the C-A-M-I, ill wit looks to kill
Man look a here, shit is real, for my people
We roll crazy thorough, we lethal, fe-cognito 
Braking you down, we equal
Hear my sequel's wit poisons plots
Stop blowing ya spot, jump back watch it be hot

[N-Tyce]
My mind changes like vacant channels
Watching Jimmie and Lionel, CD's replacing Vinyl
Thank goodness for the DJ, rap originated in the PJs
Now it's everywhere these days
But still I wanna holla (Ahhhh!)
Thought I make a record, don't control a dollar
Yeah you know it's still a white collar
Making billions when it's better half, money we already had
Yo we sick and tired of this petty cash

Chorus:
[N-Tyce]
Venom over here, Venom over there
Venom, Venom over there
Venom be like in your presents everywhere

[Finesse]
Throw ya middle fingers up
For all my homies laying in tha cut
Now let me see you get bucked</pre>
