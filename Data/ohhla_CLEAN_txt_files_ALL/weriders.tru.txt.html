[Chorus]
We riders, i'm a rider, i'm a rider, i'm a rider, i'm a rider
We riders, i'm a rider, i'm a rider, i'm a rider, i'm a rider
We riders, i'm a rider, i'm a rider, i'm a motherfuckin' rider

[C-Murder]
Any time dumpin' them fools
You see a motherfuckin' killer with No Limit tattoos
And when the smoke clear I know my job complete
And everyday I see dumb niggas die in the street
Run for cover if you soft, don't want no power
I'm a show guillotine in your picture and your mama gon' miss you nigga
You and your kids and your wife take your life
With a knife, it ain't right, but uh, the money was tight
Am I to aggressive nigga, it's hard to survive
And stay alive make you feel like a bitch inside
But if feel froggy jump, and watch me react and attack
And leave you layin' on your motherfuckin' back
Cause ain't no playin' in the game of life, the game of hustle
Where them niggas pack heat, fuck them niggas with muscle
Where the skinny niggas with the triggers sittin' on top of the mound
Runnin' fools clean out of town nigga

[Chorus]

[C-Murder]
Gettin' high hittin' the ???
And runnin' from the law, damn niggas 'll talk
To many bitches sweatin' me so i'm fuckin' 'em all
Lace the weed and them hoes be takin' it all
Take 'em down like I just touchdown from ???
Just some bitch shit, it just be sweatin' my click
50 million so, still countin', still sittin' on top
You niggas only wish what I got
Fuck a bed, fuck a house nigga
Fuck you and the watch
I'm thugged out, I be clutchin' my Glock
With more than 5 reasons for you to call me a nerd
Cause infra red held lead come straight to your head
And then you dead nigga what's up now what's up now bitch
Nigga show me you made the wrong move
You lose, bye bye, just die, don't cry, when I get high

[Chorus]

[C-Murder]
You bitch, I told you motherfuckers
No Limit Soldiers never drop we always on top motherfucker
So you better check the motherfuckin' billboard spot</pre>
