Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Hardly breathing, hardly breathing

[Verse 1]
I really wanna take you back
It's killing me watching you walk, away, yeah
But my head ain't okay with that
And lord knows how much I want you babe
It hurts me that you can't stay, ah

[Chorus]
This old heart of mine won't let you break it
Not again, not again
It hurt so many times and I can't take it, not again
Cause I'm hardly breathing
One more teary eye, or sleepless nights
Just might kill this heart of mine
Hardly breathing, hardly breathing

[Verse 1]
Begging won't do nothing
Forgave you many times along the way
Yeah, yeah, ah,
My mama said don't trust him
But deep inside my soul I found
A place and now I want you out baby

[Chorus]
This old heart of mine won't let you break it
Not again, not again
It hurt so many times and I can't take it, not again
Cause I'm hardly breathing
One more teary eye, the sleepless nights
Just might kill this heart of mine
Hardly breathing, hardly breathing

[Bridge]
Feels like I'm on my last night, night,
And I can't take a chance,
Of not being able to breathe again
Another heartbreak and I might die inside
So I learned from the last time,
That loving you ain't worth losing my life

[Chorus]
This old heart of mine won't let you break it
Not again, not again
It hurt so many times and I can't take it, not again
Cause I'm hardly breathing
One more teary eye, the sleepless nights
Just might kill this heart of mine
Hardly breathing,
Hardly breathing

[Outro]
Just might kill this heart of mine</pre>
