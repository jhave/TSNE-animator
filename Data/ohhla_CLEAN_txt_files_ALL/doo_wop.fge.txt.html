[Lauryn - Singing Chorus]
Girls you know you'd- better, watch out (Watch out!)
Some guys, some guys are only about (About!)
That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)
That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)

Throw your hands in the air!
Admit two shots in the atmosphere!

[Verse One - Lauryn]
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
Remember when he told you he was about the benjamins?
You act like you ain't here him, but gave him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really going to pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus when, you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably do it again
Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the Gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass because your thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again!
You know I only say it because i'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem
Baby girl!  Respect is just the minimum
Nigga's creepin' and you still defending him
Now -- Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly been
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans 
Fake nails up out Koreans 

Come again
Yo! A-When when come again! (Yeah-Yeah!)
When when come again!! (Yeah-Yeah!)
My friend come again!!! (Yeah-Yeah!)

[Chorus - Lauryn]
Guys you know you'd better, watch out (Watch out!)
Some girls, some girls are only, about (About!)
That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)
That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)

[Verse Two - Lauryn]
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Tim's than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like houligans
Don't care who they offend 
Popping game (Like you got yen!) 
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistol by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still living in his Mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the "big men"
Need to take care of their three and four kids
But they face a court case when the child support's late
Money taking and heart breaking
Now you wonder why women hate men
The sleepy silent men
The punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the scene, stop acting like boys and be men!
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?!
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?!
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?!
Unh-Unhh Come Again!
Bro-Straight come again!
Sit straight come again!

Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

[Lauryn - Singing Chorus]
Girls you know you'd better, watch out (Watch out!)
Some guys, some guys are only about (About!)
That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)
That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)

Guys you know you'd better, watch out (Watch out!)
Some girls, some girls are only, about (About!)
That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)
That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!)</pre>
