Song:   Wanna Take Me Back
Typed by: Ghettofabulous98@hotmail.com

Damn I can't
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Wanna take me back
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

I know I can't find in myself to love again
And if I take my time, my time
I know this thing will end
This is the last time I get hurt again, again, again, again
I'll just take it slow, it slow
And I'm sure my heart will mend

1 -	Wanna take me back
	Well forget that
	You had a chance
	But not again
	Because I'm over it

Repeat 1

No more in and out
Those ups and downs with you my friend
I didn't like the man I had
But I was too into him
Don't think you can keep wandering back
Again, again, again, again
You want me back so bad
And it's a damn shame that you

Repeat 1 (4x)

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Wanna take me back
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
(Yeah, uh, uh, say what? say what?)

Used to be just you and me
Now you say we used to be
Had a chance to be my man
Thrown away, yo that's not my bad
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
(Yeah, uh, say what?)

Repeat 1 (4x)

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh</pre>
