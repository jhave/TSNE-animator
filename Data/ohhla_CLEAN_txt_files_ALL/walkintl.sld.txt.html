They put truth and love on the plate and we ate hate
Then the lord tried to kill me so I changed faith
I spit grimace faced cause I'm sick of the taste
Clench my fists to my hips cause I'm sick of the waste
Where did our souls go, were they just misplaced?
Permanent vacations or eternal disgrace?
Don't act like you care about what happens to culture
You're just another money, cash, ho, rappin to vultures
I wish the Y2K bug actually happened
Shut the whole thing down cause we ain't actually rappin
The 21st First century can suck my clock
Getting stoned too much, we can't duck the rocks
Never ride bandwagon, I just buck the jock
I've already started walking guy, fuck the talk
Stalwart, you can bet I never drop the mic
Increase the peace but never stop the fight

Where did all the people go?
When did all these evils grow?
How do I retrieve my soul?
And stop walking the line

Stalwart, part gentleman and part Neanderthal
Anni brought his angry heart to answer y'all
They say to ask a question is to break the spell
But they say doubt the Lord and go straight to hell
My Mother always said never lay down and die
My Father always told me to let shit slide
An eye for an eye or turn the cheek?
Give medals to the strong and burn the weak
Little bitch get filthy rich like Soylent Green
Means people not evil, just spoiled by greed
Had morals to protect but didn't guard that shit
It's like we dropped all our scruples in the Sarlack pit
We're Han Solo blind when we're blocking the signs
Teetering, teetering, we're walking the line
The Man in Black told me to sing shit loudly
Johnny Cash rules everything around me

Where did all the people go?
When did all these evils grow?
How do I retrieve my soul?
And stop walking the line
Stop walking the line
Stop walking the line

The lady of judgment
Is standing above us
So pick your feet Poughkeepsie and say why don't she love us?

Killah Priest:
Live and death is like a carnival, the cemetaries
Ain't nobody left that's honorable, they've all been buried
The chronicles from Mohammed's schools of Gods, they vary
Black people all been promised jewels we lost already
My cross is heavy, I carry it, this is my burden
Look at the sky, see chariots while the Earth is just turning
Words are determined from the birth of person
I'm so hurting, soul searching, go to the liquor store can I get some more
Villages, robbers, religions, billions of dollars
Nat Turners, Geronimos, Patsy Jerner
Truth with burners, all the chaos that the youth emerge from
Know what I mean? Annakin Slayd, Killah Priest
We back from the grave

Where did all the people go?
When did all these evils grow?
How do I retrieve my soul?
And stop walking the line
Stop walking the line
Stop walking the line</pre>
