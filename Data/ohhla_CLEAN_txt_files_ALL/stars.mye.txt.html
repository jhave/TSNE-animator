"He just pushed through all of those personal difficulties"
"He was stronger, he was more, he was bolder
 He had more nerve, he took more chances
 He, he had, he had the gall to do things that had never been done before"

[John Robinson]
Listen, he wanna see the stars align like Orion's belt
Through the hearts and minds, many a song's felt
Poker face, had to play with all the cards dealt
Had dreams of being ice king but it can all melt - fast
A blast from the past and the future
Story of his life plus a big bowl of soup or
a plate of fish, which was his favorite dish
He Kobe on these mics, every verse goes "swish"
Legendary in his own state of rhythm
Many men and women round the globe, they would listen
Countless stories told to the children
Problem was his props didn't measure with his financial visions
for his self and others, not a selfish brother
Optimistic of all that his journey would uncover
Discover the heights and extremes
from the downfalls of being overseen, from here to overseas
He kept the dream alive and the torch lit
Never give up through many thoughts of forfeit
Big picture, he never sweat the small bits at all
Politician of his craft, always stand tall
Suited up for greatness, such an elegant touch on life
Love is the answer, I guess it's time I found my wife
and plant next level seeds, a legacy
Divine bloodline, he shines, top pedigree

[Chorus: Kam Moye] + (John Robinson)
As we wait for stars to align now
There's no breaks, no games, no time out
But that's just part of who we are
Watch out, I'm a shining star
And the beat goes (shining star)
Now break it down now (that's what we are)
Now keep rocking y'all (shining star)
J.R. (that's what we are) K.M.

[Kam Moye]
I'm waiting for the stars to align and jumpstart, ignite things
I'm dedicated to what might be a pipe dream
But I'm a risk taker, change isn't frightening
The good, bad or ugly, I deal with what life brings
While these smoking mirror niggas think I did it big
I work overtime at a shitty city gig
I'm worth revenue
But here I am tryna balance my talent around my work schedule
Now people said that I'm dope
Am I enough to spend federal notes to keep my credit afloat?
Make these bill collector's creditors ghosts, hell I hope so
Note players will peddle they poke, I got a dope show
But there's still two sides to being Kam Moye
One's a rapper, the other owes his landlord
On one hand I got a steady paying day gig
But feel like I'm being chained to a slave ship
The other hand holds music as my day job
But the music industry's like a graveyard
I can have coworkers or have followers
My heart's not in the same place my wallet was
But I'd rather be crafting my own path for me
Too many people straight wasting their lives
I'd rather suffer doing something I love
than to be a rich man in a place I despise

[Chorus]

"I'll tell it like it is
 Everybody do they own thing
 Like so many times when I start talking about things that's normal
 People become uncomfortable
 It makes me feel good to see so many black folks now doing so many different things
 in Shiloh, North Carolina"</pre>
