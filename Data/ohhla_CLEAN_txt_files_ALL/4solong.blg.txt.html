So much mail I can hardly spend it 
VS lumps in my rolex pendent 
Shit been spending for the past ten years 
Face done escaped all tatooed tears 
I guess I can only thank the Lord for that 
'Cuz shit was gettin' hectice tryin' to get my scratch 
If it wasn't them one time penelopes 
It was coward ass niggaz tryin' to take my G's 
When I first started out I was broke as a bitch 
Grew up in the slums wouldn't trade it for shit 
'Cuz the niggaz that was rich when I was poor 
Is now on blow and comin' through buyin fat 2-0 
See they spend it with me 
But pretendin' to be 
On the grind 
Tryin' to get a stack like mine 
But now I'm knowin' 
Pockets growin' 
And when it's snowin' 
??????? 
Yo' nigga can't lie I was livin' it up 
The rule of big pimpin' now my '70 Cut' 
I probably hit the park drinkin on Bo's berry 
Slammin' Rick James 'cuz I'm in love with Mary 
You can't be scary if you want your scrill 
Pack you steel 
Nigga kill at will 
Guard your grille 
'Cuz if you real 
Then it's on 
I'm talkin' so long 

X4 
Oh so long making my revi's 

So many playas comin' up in the game 
And everybody got a sack of rock cocaine 
Mobb car drivin' 
Condo livin' 
And every fuckin' day was just like Thanksgiving 
The city where I'm from is getting so damn cold 
Niggaz outta control 
At 16 years old 
Them young muthafuckas ain't givin' a fuck 
They tryin' to get a buck 
And get some hair on their nuts 
The savage ass grind starting takin' my mind 
A nigga came through with all new tec-9's 
Semi-automatic with extended clips 
A chopper every nigga down with my click 
Neighborhood funkin' 
Mail's on slow 
It's barely comin' through 
And all I'm sellin is O's 
I ride high performance when it gets like this 
Electric everything, racing cam and kits 
I'm livin' on the edge but I'm lovin' the high 
I'm either goin' down or I'm goin' die 
Hot ones echo through the geto limp 
Put the tip out the window let the AK spit 
They just caught my homey with a pound of crack 
Plus the other day they said he robbed a bank 
A million dollar bail in his Uncle's own 
All charges got dropped cuz it's oh so long 

X4 
Oh so long making my revi's 

My Momma must have prayed real hard for me 
'Cuz I woke up in the mornin' wasn't slanging no D 
I was on my way out to the church to see 
If the Lord could find a better way today for B 
Read me some scriptures 
Fed my soul 
And I'll tell you like this I ain't slangin' no more 
Your boys been blessed in so many ways 
In the night and in the day and in His name I pray 
Thanks for the Lexus, jewels, and home 
Even though I can't take 'em with me when I'm gone 
But Heaven is the place for Legitimate B 
So when You come and get Your folks You comin' for me 

X4 
Oh so long making my revi's </pre>
