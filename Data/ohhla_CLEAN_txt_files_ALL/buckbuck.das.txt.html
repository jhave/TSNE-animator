Verse 1: Skoob

Ding! Back in the ring yo it's the tag team jams (yeah yeah yeah)
So all rise for the honours balk, your lies mark your drum
Now I'm stronger and I'm faster, thicker than your pasta
I got more styles than most MC's can master
I'm (what?) D-wilin, (what?) three stylin (what what??) regardless
Beatin me is like the Bills beatin Dallas
Keep them shorts fro the midgets, there! I be the shit, it
and plus I light that ass up like the numerical digits
in my (beeper), cos we're throwin niggas in the (sleeper)

Be on you everywhere, my style it ain't the everyday
It's better, we're sayin shit that other niggas never say (kid)
Cookin the flows (what?) to make your toes wanna tip (tip)
I used to be a wheel watcher til I got my whip (whip)
You see I walk with a (bop bop), I talk with the (slop slop)
Man, you like six bull balls in a slot (slot slot)
It's the abortion, son I'm launchin, quick to floor shit
Click-click now I'm on some Quick Draw McGraw shit
For shit, now Dice bring it back on the seal
Alright we get the busters, smoke blunts out the mill (yeah)

Krazy fuckin Drayzie on the mic (yeah), I spread like (cancer)
So peep it (yeah) cos I'ma keep it straighter than an arrow

Tell y'all niggas now there ain't a motherfucker like me!
(Ya hype be), I'm slightly in the mood so watch me wreck shit (yeah)
Check shit, I be on some new improved (neck shit)
I flex shit, that's the way I flip it on a angle
You knows who I are, wear my star like the spangled
banner, bust the grammar but I bring forth my knockers
If it ain't hip-hop (aiyyo)
well then it gotta be some rockin (BOW! BOW! BOW!)
I'm risin in your ???? and corn flakes, you're gonna lose me (lose me)
And if ya didn't know, one more here (This is why my nigga choose me)

Chorus:

So give a buck-buck

Throw your hands (in the air)

With a buck-buck (here)

From the front to the (rear)
Throw your hands in the air
