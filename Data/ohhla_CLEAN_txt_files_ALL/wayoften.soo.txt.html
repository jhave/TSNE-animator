Yeah we kind of like that shit, yeah
That's all we do, huh check it

[Soopafly]
Now what I'm not gettin' is that (why you)
Can't understand you can't rock a mic like (I do)
I fuck around with niggaz but then they (try to)
Take advantage and take for granted so I (slide through)
With the automatic to stay on deck - (dust some niggaz)
I always look em' in the eye, I can't (trust these niggaz)
I'm bein' real, what you seein' - (Soopa-fly)
Don't be goin' for no shit, it's (do or die)
I be hangin' with niggaz, love to do the (gangsta walk)
When we bust - hush, hit it, that's (gangsta talk)
I freak a hoe every now and then but (don't pay)
I'm actin' funny with my money, uh-uh (no way)
Now if you think you ran into some riches - (wrong way)
Turn around but you can still hit this (bombay)
I roll around through the hood with the (top down)
Hit the switches for the bitches, make it (drop now)
Jealous niggaz playa hatin' can't (stop the sound)
Askin' where I'm from, hit em' up - (Dogg Pound)
In Tha Gang where we blast just to (maintain)
And the weed, alcohol got us (insane)
You can run but sometime ya gotta (feel the pain)
We drop the kick bumpin' in your (system man)

[Chorus]
[Soopafly] - It's like way too often, I keep rockin'
             All my niggaz they can hear my beat knockin'
             Pimp struttin' as I walk in
             (Say what?) Hearin' all my bitches talkin'

[Kurupt]   - It's like way too often, I keep rockin'
             All my niggaz they can hear my beat knockin'
             Pimp struttin', I hear all the homies talkin'
             At the party all the homies C-Walkin'

[Soopafly]
I make a left on Atlantic then I (ride by)
Seen my niggaz from the Pound so I (slide by)
Say what's happenin' to them niggaz that don't (know my)
Name and my game, give a fuck I'm (so high)
Ran out to get the plan out the (swoopty blue)
What's happenin'?, crack a nigga with that (whoopty woop)
Hit the back shack, stepped to this (rack that crack)
Laid down the game, gangs can't (stop the mack)
I say I'm a pimp and (I am)
Hard on a hoe, make her say ("god damn")
They say "what you want?", I say girl (why pick?)
They say "give up cash", I say (eat my dick)
I hopped back up into my Lincoln, the (beat knock)
I need somebody, rolled up my weed bust a (key to rock)
Roll two joints, a blunt, leave the stash (up front)
While I turn up the beat and give 'em (what they want)

[Chorus]
[Soopafly] - It's like way too often, I keep rockin'
             All my niggaz they can hear my beat knockin'
             Pimp struttin' as I walk in
             (Say what?) Hearin' all my bitches talkin'

[Kurupt]   - It's like way too often, I keep rockin'
             All my niggaz they can hear my beat knockin'
             Pimp struttin', I hear all the homies talkin'
             At the party all the homies C-Walkin'

[Kurupt]
You know how gangstas do, all we do is (make ends)
And everything that ain't ours nigga we (takin')
I saw your bitch and she wanna eat a (fat dick)
Make a nigga grip the heater and (blast shit)
All the homies C-Walkin' in the (parking lot)
We in khakis, blast niggaz in (Karl Kani)
Nigga this a gangsta party, and you ain't s'posed to be here
Nigga best to beware, prepared - (look a here)
I'ma tell ya how (G's do)
Dip with the chrome with the all gold (D's too)
Soopafly and Kurupt and we're (back again)
If ya trip then trip, gangbang Blood or Crip
Come equipped, or don't come at all to the strip
Or ya might get hit with shit that make ya flip
And if that ain't the case, I'ma tell you to your face
As the sun shine on my palm, fuck all y'all

[Chorus]
[Kurupt]   - It's like way too often, I keep rockin'
             All the bitches wanna blow off my socks and
             Pimp struttin', I hear all the homies talkin'
             At the party all the homies C-Walkin'

[Soopafly] - It's like way too often, I keep rockin'
             All my niggaz they can hear my beat knockin'
             Pimp struttin' as I walk in
             (Say what?) Hear my bitches talkin'


[Outro: Soopafly]
Tight ass niggaz huh?
Yeah, Soopafly, Kurupt
Not givin' a fuck about a bitch
Hoes, sluts, tramps, tricks, y'knamsayin'?, skanks
Why? - 'cause this for my niggaz
Yeah we keep puttin' it down like that
If y'all niggaz out there got that gangsta shit
We got it
Keep goin' on and on
Don't stop, don't quit
Uh, we give a fuck about a trick ass bitch
Two niggaz, yeah
