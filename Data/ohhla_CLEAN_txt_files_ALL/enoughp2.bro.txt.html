[Intro] [Phonte talking]
Part 2 bitches! Shake a load off. (A world premier)
Yo, shake a load off
One mo', shake a load off. One more time, shake a load off
We on our N.C. shit right now. Raleigh/Durham, Bull City
Gate City, Queen City. Tayetiam and all point in between

[Verse One]
They say that I'm an animal
Whether we do it in digital or we do it in analog
Tay's the voice 
The number one choice 
That got the ladies moist in they panty draws
So keep thinkin' that it's sweet when it ain't at all
I tell you, this ain't what you want maine
Adults maine, who is not playin' with you god damn neanderthals
Get your knuckles off the floor nigga, we standin' tall
Eight years, still standin' strong
With no signs of lettin' up, I only get stronger
Y'all rap niggas done played every role in the book
And now you runnin' out of characters
Twit longer
Nigga get on
We got it sewn, get your mitt on
My style dumb fresh
Just like a drum set
In a singles bar tryin' not to get hit on
No stones thrown at thrown that I sit on

[Chorus] [Phonte]
Cause I ain't get enough
And she ain't get enough
And he ain't get enough
And we ain't get enough
And they ain't get enough
We need to get enough
My niggas throw it up
My bitches shake it up
[Khrysis]
Cause I ain't get enough
And she ain't get enough
And he ain't get enough
And we ain't get enough
And they ain't get enough
We need to get enough
My niggas throw it up
My bitches shake it up

[Verse Two] [Khrysis]
I know you wonder, "Why he doin' this?"
New way of thinkin' just tired of the bullshit
It's time to get this cash quick
No games involved
Tired of playin' with y'all
Done sittin' on the bench, chewin' gum with y'all
Niggas sittin' round watchin', bumpin' gums and all
Naw
It's time to make shit happen
Time for the action, sad eye for the actors
They ain't see this shit comin'
And now they wanna come runnin', flockin' by the dozens
Full fledged flank, you should see it cousin
All because of what your boy was bakin' in the oven
And I ain't leavin' out with nothin' empty handed bullshit
Niggas show and prove somethin'
Cover my ground cause I ain't tryin' to lose nothin'
There's ladies in the crowd and they be tryin' to move somethin'
They can feel it in they body when the tunes pumpin'
She was givin' me the eye, I had to stop frontin'
And now she's ridin' with me
Oh, I didn't know she was yours
I'll have her back around three

[Chorus] [Khrysis]
Cause I ain't get enough
And she ain't get enough
And he ain't get enough
And we ain't get enough
And they ain't get enough
We need to get enough
My niggas throw it up
My bitches shake it up
[Big Pooh]
Cause I ain't get enough
And she ain't get enough
And he ain't get enough
And we ain't get enough
And they ain't get enough
We need to get enough
My niggas throw it up
My bitches shake it up

[Verse Three] [Big Pooh]
+Live At The Barbecue+, down south with a view
Hey, what your name is? Shorty better get a clue
They say the end comin' soon, better start anew
I say the baby teeth gone, give me more to chew
One of the chosen few
Last man standin'
No patience for your pleas or your propagandin'
High stakes, poker face, niggas backgammon
R.P. over beats, see the back handin'
Gap Band +Outstanding+ is the theme song
You ain't made a dollar yet, then you dream raw
This is the resin arts of a beast
Made a crater outta crease, no peace, nigga King Kong
I don't mean harm
It's just a brain storm
I warned you once, nigga ain't gotta think far
Is this the proper form?
I suppose so
The Last Dragon out of shape
Kiss the shell toe

[Big Pooh]
Cause I ain't get enough
And she ain't get enough
And he ain't get enough
And we ain't get enough
And they ain't get enough
We need to get enough
My niggas throw it up
My bitches shake it up</pre>
