Who is the man with the masterplan?
A nigga witta motherfuckin gun

44 reason come to mind
Why you motherfuckin brothers' hard to find
He be walkin on the streets and fuckin with mine
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind
See I never take a step on a Compton block
or LA without the AK ready to pop
Cos them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight
I thinks it's better to be retellin the facts than cuffed up
and jacked and fucked up
What you niggas lookin at? You goin
goddamn! Cos it's the city
and for you to survive a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And I'm a nigga you can't remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin to prove
To their homies that they can hang by dealin with me
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D
I never did time on a murder yet
Cos I relax and back, do a job and jet
Yo I know you understand my flow
So here we go with Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

Who is the man with the masterplan?
A nigga witta motherfuckin gun
Who is the man with the masterplan?
A nigga witta motherfuckin gun

D-R-E
A motherfucker who's known for carryin gats
and kick raps that make snaps
Adapts to anything violent that I'm located at
If you see me on the solo moves best believe that I'm strapped
4-4, .tre-8 or AK-47
Cos slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
and lay a punk motherfucker flat
As he wonder what popped before he got popped
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop
Now I know you understand my flow
So here we go with Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

Who is the man with the masterplan?
A nigga witta motherfuckin gun
Who is the man with the masterplan?
A nigga witta motherfuckin gun
Who is the man with the masterplan?
A nigga witta motherfuckin gun
Who is the man with the masterplan?
A nigga witta motherfuckin gun

I breaks em off, I breaks em off yeah
I breaks em off, I breaks em off yeah
I breaks em off but I ain't speakin about between the thighs
I'm talkin about cockin a gauge in between your eyes
That'll make you drop to your knees cos you realise
that a gat will make any nigga civilised
Old buster ass nigga talkin bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor
A nigga that breaks em off proper-ly
Real G so doubt it
I'm the one who's doin it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my .44 Desert Eagle to his motherfuckin dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name's Dre Eastwood when I'm packin a gun
You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try
And if you die youse a buster cos real niggas don't die
But some still don't hear me though
You're too near me not to hear me, nigga yo
So now you know

Who is the man with the masterplan?
A nigga witta motherfuckin gun
Who is the man with the masterplan?
A nigga witta motherfuckin gun
Who is the man with the masterplan?
A nigga witta motherfuckin gun
Who is the man with the masterplan?
A nigga witta motherfuckin gun</pre>
