I can tell that money's got you workin
We've been talkin for so long
Now we're finally here in person
I taste pain and regret, in your sweat
You've been waitin for me, Oh-ho

All those other men were practice, they were practice
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me

[Chorus]
Girl you look good won't you back that ass up
You a fine muh'fucker won't you back that ass up
Call me Big Daddy won't you back that ass up
Girl who is you playin with, back that ass up
You workin with some ass yeah, you bad yeah
Girl you workin with some ass yeah, you bad yeah

[Verse 1]
Girl you workin with ass yeah, you bad yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash yeah, his last yeah
Hoes frown when you pass yeah, they mad yeah
Couple thousand on your bag yeah, fuck yeah
I'm a Big Tymer nigga yeah, money flipper yeah
Get it understood yeah, it's all good yeah
Girl I know it's real cause I've been around it
You only want what's real you just never found it
Don't give them no more chances, ooh girl they had their turn
Everythin for a reason, there's things you had to learn from them
But when I get you to myself
You know what's goin down, what's goin down

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

But a let a real nigga make it right
Let a real nigga make it right, you deserve that much

You can even call me daddy, I'll give you somethin to look up to

[Bridge]
All my girls from the 504 need to drop it right now
