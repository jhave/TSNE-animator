[Intro: Heavy D]
Hey...
Oooh-ooooh, ohh

[Heavy D]
Uh, I'm talkin back in the beginning
When you used to flaunt me with a dozen of huggings and kissings
Trips we used to go on with such beautiful scenery
Walks in the park after dark you really mean to me
the world; I love your stylin, profilin, the way you smilin
I used to keep you gigglin, chillin, livin in style and
Those winter nights when you was alone, I kept on holdin ya
The days when you were drownin in tears, I kept consolin ya
I used to love to wake up in mornings and see your smile
On winter days we would stay in bed an extra while
But nowadays, I'm in a daze, it's like you hate me
So I spend day after days contemplatin we

[Chorus]
Remember when you used to listen
And now you pay me no mind (mind, mind, mind, mind)
Uh, what happened to the huggin and kissin?
This ain't that love that I was fallin for, fallin for
Fallin for

[Heavy D]
Yo, did the money come between us?
Or is it just true that men are from Mars, women from Venus?
I met you at your greenest but today you at your meanest
And even our friends say somethin wrong when they see us
I'm losing sleep every night and day, what came between us?
Like do she creep, cause everyday we're becoming strangers
When I love you turns to I hate you ungrateful love
The days when you were drownin in tears, I kept consolin ya
I used to love to wake up in mornings and see your smile
On winter days we would stay in bed an extra while
But nowadays, I'm in a daze, it's like you hate me
So I spend day after days contemplatin we

[Chorus 2X]

[Heavy D]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yah, uh..
Yo, I'm so confused, baby you got me
walkin on the edge, travellin the ledge
Sleepin on the floors, climbin the walls
Baby, you push me to my limits with your trickery and gimmicks
What I'm wonderin is, do you still love the kid?
Do you accept the things I do to you, forgive the things I did?
This ain't no way to live, you get back what you give
Either you negative or positive, I wanna live
I used to love to wake up in mornings and see your smile
On winter days we would stay in bed an extra while
But nowadays, I'm in a daze, it's like you hate me
So I spend day after days contemplatin we

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
