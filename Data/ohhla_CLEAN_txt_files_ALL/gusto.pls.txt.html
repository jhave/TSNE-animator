Song:   Gusto
Typed by: Osirus260@aol.com

Yeah A we gone do this up son
Yo we from Hempstead as close to the shacks as Parkside

Chorus:

My whole team is out for the gusto
Internally blood drip through ya body slow
We on the go but yo time is still limited
Unlimited type style and we be rippin shit
My whole team is out for the gusto
Internally blood drip through ya body slow
We on the go but yo time is still limited
Unlimited type style

A+:

Welcome to the PSG I represent
The littlest in the crew but first one to get up in em
I straight up skin em like wolves 
I wish you would have been 
Fakin jack and get ya whole hood hit
But it's all good 
We do the things y'all wish y'all could
And play the bat yo and watch the brothas bark like wood
So knock on it
Go head you want it
Nobody want it 
You turned in for it pulled nine stingers like a brown hornet
While y'all was droppin I was underground shadowboxin
Layin low puttin final touches on the flow
So here we go, tryin to snatch that dough
Got niggaz breakin camp like Dre from Death Row
From the streets to the jail, I represent well
Touch a nigga like brail, jacks are hotter than the third rail
Scale to tip in my favor, the livest save 
Grade up in the U.S. now lets get this paper

Chorus:

Prodigy:

I'm yawnin while I wake up to the early morning gun-fire
Another day another scar to acquire
Jumped out my bed tried to break my alarm
Took a shower and then I strapped on my firearm
Grab my Pelle Pelle cuz I wanna look fly when I die
But it ain't my turn to say goodbye
How do I know? Some people call it instincts
I like to call it my luck who gives a fuck
Im stuck, in this environment can't depart from it
And if I try I always end up back where I started 
Plan A square one there's no escapin
So I pun and realize my too
I'm tryin to live a full life before my time is through
Clock's tickin, so I don't got no time for you
As I head outside amongst the rest of the animals
Where I feel relaxed and safe and I can stand it
(To all my kiko's)
It's sort of like a family brawl
We gather up all the soldiers and form into a invincible
Swarm of kids, now it's on again
Drinkin straight from the bottle warm gin drippin down my chin
For the crippled children you can't win 
Against 25 niggaz bent up with mac-10's
Semi-automatic, fully addicted crime addict
So long as there's cash involved I gotta have it
There's many different levels of the criminal mind
Either you're in it for the gusto or Im wastin your time

Chorus:

A+:

Now is you ready for men, cuz they your peeps that you saw
You probably heard about me and my crew doin what we do
For my nigga True and Smif-n-Wessun
Cuz I be wreckin mic-checkin fools that come around second-guessin
I sparks in the dark like stars in the sky
Spiritually, lyrically, since knee-high
The cradle, I represent my peoples and my label
Cause when you take a ride through Parkside it's fatal
What's my time to shine my design you can't define
It only takes a line and a rhyme to blow that mind 
To have you buggin, niggaz got they tapes dubbin
Where ain't no line for me to kick a rhyme pushin and shovin
Now it's over, walkin like a soldier I told ya
Shorty droppin bombs and shit, like Oklahoma
Kinda soul, comin wit that bomb for sure 
Run for shelter little brotha when it rain it pour

Chorus: 

Prodigy:

First of all the foundation
Money is the root of all evil
The cream'll have you shittin on your people
Livin like lotto, everything is everything
Ain't nothing change but the clothes that my money bring
I'm makin figures that I never thought possible
You try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army in techses
And them Acuras that made you get your cap peeled backwards
For years, I've been tryin to blow for years
Gettin bent off Moet spend a G on beers
Livin life to the fullest, my story ends wit a bullet
To the chrome-oil drop to the bottom of the pot
My invincible crew will never stop
If you're lookin, you can find me risin to the top
I'm a classic approach my level and get your ass kicked
Floatin in a river wit yo body rapped in plastic
I'm tryin to make a half a million triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team dies
I can still hear his voice while he up in the sky
While the rest still livin steady tellin me lies
It's like a bad dream, and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love it and I can't give it up
