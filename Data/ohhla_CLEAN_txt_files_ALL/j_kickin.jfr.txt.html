The F-L-Y guy
About to toss some action
Here I go again with a groove to move you
Somethin' kinda smooth, you can bop your head to
Chill it, the feel, you can play it anytime
Its smooth, is the groove, play it back behind the rhyme
So please, put a freeze, on hooving and hollering
Fans deserve more, for their hip-hop dollar, man
And I'm just the rapper to deliver
The rapper that can give a
Funky rhyme, flowing like a river
Silky, silky, kind to the ear
Diction perfect, rhymes all clear
Tempo moderate, this ain't no marathon
Step back, new jack's, observe the paragon
Ha, who? what? why? when?
Don't be looking around clown, that's right, I'm back again
With the dopeness, your head is bopping isn't it?
Yeah I thought so
Yo, I'm just kickin' it
Yeah---
Just kickin' it­Yeah, Yeah
I'm just kickin' it
I really cannot kick it
Just kickin it
Jus watch me y'all; I'm just kickin' it ­ kickin' it
Uh Just kickin' it
Yeah, yo I'm just kickin' it
Just kick, and just kick it
Just kickin' it -Ooh
Prepare for a voyage, just close your eyes
Who ain't ready, holler out I
Well ain't nobody hollering,
'Cause all is perfect
The groove is a wave, and my rhyme's a surfing
The track design
With a rhyme in mind
Bidi budup up up, the charges will climb
Every young rapper trying to get you to jump
But when you're all done jumpin'
I'ma get you what you really want
Track by track displaying my ability
The man, FP, showing true dexterity
On the Mic, no rules are lawless
Wicked, and a kicker and my rhymes are flawless
So sit back, relax and allow me to rock ya
With a hit that you're gonna get mentally locked to
A hip-hop solid and all flow, flower
I post up, together, better than Noah
A cut, to kick it too, kind to the ear drum
All true poetry, for me y'all be hearin' some
So extra, extra, read all about it
I slam a the hell out of those that doubt it
I'm rippin' every city I been in
Coast to coast, not to boast, but I'm winning
My fans are powerful, and that's the way I'm living
All about effort y'all
Yo, I'm just kickin' it
Uh Just kickin' it
Yeah, yeah, Im just kickin' it
Just kickin' it
Come on Come on, I'm just kickin' it
Just kickin' it
Now, I'm just kickin' it
Just kickin' it ­ Just kickin' it
Let's take a trip, mellow out while I'm rappin'
Ya mind is the boat, and my rhyme's the captain
So hoist a sail, and it's time to flow
To a place that other rappers don't go
Welcome, welcome, into my territory
Everbody get on up, and get busy for me
Heads are boppin' hard and fast
And now I'm getting' sued 'cause my groove caused whiplash
Everytime a rhymer tried to
Say something smooth, that'll move inside you
The way that you should feel when you hear a real rap
Is trapped in the rhyme and your climbing to the climax
A lyrical painter, the fresh prince
And y'all a know of my Picasso essence
Musical passion, lovely isn't?
But ain't nothin' to it
Yo, I'm just kickin' it
Just kickin' it- Just kickin'
Check me, check me, just kickin' it
Just kickin' it- Just kickin' it
Like Pronto y'all, I'm just kickin' it
Just kickin' it
Uh, I'm just kickin' it
Just kickin' it
Yo, I'm out
Just kickin' it (9x)
La-aha
