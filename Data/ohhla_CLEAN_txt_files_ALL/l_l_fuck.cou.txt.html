[Chorus]
I'm here to laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor
and help the damn revolution come quicker
Laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor; and help make a revolution
I'm here to laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor
and help the damn revolution come quicker
Laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor; and maybe make a revolution

Now this thing fin to end in fisticuffs
But if you gots to go 'head, twist it up
That's yo job fin make you piss in cups
Make you have to hustle rent with your pistols up

Now if Uncle Sam promisin' his murder gang
We goin' to rise out this ash like that bird of flame
Hopin' you take action from the word I bring
But if the police ask you never heard my name

Five years old, eyelids half-mast
Bedtime is 8 PM, it's half past
Try to take me to bed, I make the mad dash
Scared in my sleep, I miss what had passed
Quarter century later, I'm still not sleepin'
If I'm not involved I feel I ain't breathin'
If I can't change the world, I ain't leavin' baby
That's the same reason you should call me this evening

[Chorus]
I'm here to laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor
and help the damn revolution come quicker
Laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor; and help make a revolution
I'm here to laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor
and help the damn revolution come quicker
Laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor; and maybe make a revolution

I fin to take shots that make a mark
Not just take shots of Maker's Mark
That's how they make us marks
We gotta try see the whole system break apart

We fin to drive to the lake and park
Before we start, here's a club smelling like sweat, rum and perfume
She lettin' out whoops 'cause they playin' her tune
If we could, we would stay here 'til it turned noon
'Til the sky, we resist and resume

It's millenium three, we colared and cuffed
It's a world conversation, I'm hollarin' stuff
Like we done wallowed in muck, and squalorin' up
Who's the culprit, follow the buck, I'm just followin' up
'Cause like me, you gots to be in the middle of it
Unravellin' the riddle of it
And to do that you goin' to ride on the powers that be
Well I fin to ride with you, take me home in your little

I'm here to laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor
and help the damn revolution come quicker
Laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor; and help make a revolution
I'm here to laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor
and help the damn revolution come quicker
Laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor; and maybe make a revolution
(that's right!)

I'm not just *
We up against the wall
We can't just talk about it
Get all up in it now

I'm here to laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor
and help the damn revolution come quicker
Laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor; and help make a revolution
I'm here to laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor
and help the damn revolution come quicker
Laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor; and maybe make a revolution
(that's right!)

Laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor; (that's right!!)
Laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor; (that's right!!)
Laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor, (that's right!!)
Laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor, (that's right!!)

I'm here to laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor
and help the damn revolution come quicker
Laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor; and help make a revolution
I'm here to laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor
and help the damn revolution come quicker
Laugh, love, fuck and drink liquor; and maybe make a revolution</pre>
