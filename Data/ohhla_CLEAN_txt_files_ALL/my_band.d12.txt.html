[Intro - Eminem]
I don't know dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
Cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everybody's got a fuckin problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because.

[Chorus - Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse - Eminem]
So I get off stage right and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
"Sup ladies? my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby"
They're all like "Oh my God it's him!"
"Becky oh my fucking god it's Eminem!!!"
"I swear to fucking God dude you fucking rock!"
"Please won't you please let me suck your cock!"
And by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're trying to steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me be

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Eminem] (3x)
My band! my band! my band!

[Verse - Swifty McVay]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Pro Tools?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you were Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with our dressing room?!
Cause my shit is lookin smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doing jumpin jacks whiling get whipped on my back

[Verse - Kuniva &amp; (Kon Artis)]
Look at Em little punk ass thinking he the shit
(Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick)
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
(Eminem: No I had an interview, not you two)
You gon be late for soundcheck
(Man I ain't going to soundcheck)
And our mics are screwed up (and his always sound best!)
(You know what man, I'm a say something)
(Hey yo Em!) (Eminem: You got somethin to say?!)
(Man nothing) I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up?
(Man I'm a tell him when I feel like it, man shut up)
(And you ain't even back me up when we supposed to be a crew)
Man I was bout to talk right after you, I swear
(Aww man whatever) I swear man

[Chorus]

[Verse - Proof]
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to the amusement parks
I'm gon let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Eminem: Hey yo it's.. )
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey dude I love your band!)
We ain't a band bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
(Eminem: Proof carry my bag) bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)

[Verse - Bizarre]
God damn it, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artis - slipped me some crack
'Lose Yourself' video I was in the back
'Superman' video I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall! ask us the questions
Like who's D12? how we get started? (What about Eminem?)
Bitch are you retarded?!
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomache, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy!)
50 told me to do situps to get buff
Did two and a half and then couldn't get up
Fuck D12! I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

[Eminem Singing]
Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
And it just tares my ass apart to know that you dont know my band
(Man fuck this!) {*punch*}

[Chorus - Bizarre]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (ha ha!)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (fuck Marshall!)
Cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Bridge]

[Bizarre]
The hottest boy band in the world - D12!

[Eminem as a Salsa singer]
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girl's to take off their underpants
And the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girl's want to dance
My salsa, look out for my next single it's called 'My Salsa'
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls wanna dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa
Where'd everybody go?</pre>
