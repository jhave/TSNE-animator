[Tek] (Steele)
Sittin on the toilet, shittin, puffin the dough
Strobe light affect, everything's movin slow
Slip into a deep zone, the sound let the phone bring me home
Stagger to my feet, emotion toward the walk talk
(Aiyo Ripper what up nigga, check out this proposition
There's money to bait and I'm in the mood to go fishing)
Whatever nigga, give me time to wash my ass
My habit at your norm' day, fiendin for the cash
(Do what you gotta do, cuz I'm on my way in the car
Cuz when I get there, yo we outie like Tamar) Right right easy
(Now I'm off to the south to get more info on this dough I heard about
Gotta make sure everything secure
Can't let me and my man let these grants slip past our hands
The man's out heavy today
I hope they don't try to get in the way of our pay)
Damn, I'm ready, high noon, the man's out
Gotta take a quick shower, get dressed and bounce
Grabbed a fatigue, strapped out the generals
Proper attire for all criminals
Blazed up the clip, loads up the 4/5th
If a boy riff, leave a body their stiff
Who dem man there gon rap on my door
Disturb me at work, on the low dub four (Yo it's me)
Who that (ST, what up) Aight hold up son, let me put it back on safety
(Aiyo kid it smells like fresh grown cess, lets
Twist up some trees before we jet)
True, you know we keep a fat pack of sensee
Even though you know it make our pockets go empty
(But no less about to starved into free men
So whenever we finish we gon bag up this spinach)
Easier said than done, peep the 4-1-1
The dred around the corner, just try to blast Ruck and dunn
(I knew it, bad vibes flowin like fluid
Forget about the dough, let's do it
I see you already strapped pa, so I'll meet you
outside, cuz my gats back in the car
How far must one go
before he throw his whole entire life right out the window)

(talking)

[Tek] (Steele)
And a dead boy, and I don't even know
(Aiyo he looks like the dred, that hooked us up on the low)
What you say fly?
(Thinkin out loud, just caught me in the zone
I'll tell you all about it on the way home)
Whatever, I'mma send this nigga to his essence
Fuckin wit the family, know he gotta learn a lesson
And you know he ain't yardy right
Some boy gon get dead tonight
As we strap on the gloves, feel the buzz from cannabis
Niggas bout to get scandalous

(arguing and gunshots)

[Steele]
Gotta be gon the double, I think I seen them all tumble
But on the left there's trouble
Undercover had to spill staked out
Watchin the whole thing go down, yo it's time to brake out
The 4/5th as I shift and drive
Cuz every mind right here might not leave alive

[Tek]
Son why you stallin? Hop on the ballin
Get us outta here before we be the next fallin
Right now, this whole shit is bug, we the thugs
Yet the beast comin up showin niggas love
Took our burners, gave us dap, let us bounce
Now it's back to the dog house, to smoke the next ounce

(talking)

[Steele]
Who could believe them beats left us alone
And took the chrome that's in one of our own back home
And not only that kid, check
How money that we just did, was that connect
For the cash, them pigs must of had dips for the stash
That ain't that some shit for ya ass

[Tek]
Troops say, ya never liked this pretty ass anyway
But that shit wit the pigs CO-made my day
Gave me a whole new outlook on the beast
Even watched out for the ones so called the beast
But anyway, you know we high right now
Doin it like this, the original crook style</pre>
