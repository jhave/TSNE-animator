[Intro: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah)
What's up baby girl! (Ho!)
Thought I had to talk to you again, missing you (Hey, ey, ey, ey)
Tim is missing you Missy's missing you
Rashad is missing you your mom is missing you (N-n-n-n-no no no)
Your pop is missing you Dame is missing you damn we missing you...WOO!!!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah)
All we listen to is all the different yous
Four page letters in addition to
Have you ever loved somebody used to get the party poppin
We used to party alot, we used to be in the Hampton's partied alot
We was The Breakfast Club you was a part of the ROC
We used to make up special names for the food we ate
Remember cerial pie one of your favorite plates (I miss you)
Well Dame told me tell you he's doin well
Due to the circumstances, it could've been Bellevue
But I ain't got to tell you, you lookin over us
Our little angel, but you know what

[Chorus: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah)
Brooklyn's missing you Detroit is missing you
New Orleans missing you Philly's missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
Your uncle's missing you your families missing you
Your fans is missing you the galleries missing you
Damn we missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah)
Now Star is mad I won't grant him a interview
Now he's dissing me cause he dissed you
Can you believe the nerve of this dude?
Cause of your memory I won't bring in the pistols
But he got issues enough of that lame
I never seen pain like your parents pain
But I know God protecting you
You used to read Seed Of The soul I know God perfecting you
All the estrogen the darker texture you are the more intellectual
You are so professional our little purple star
Too good for earth you are (I miss you)

[Chorus: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah)
Houston's missng you L.A.'s missing you
DC's missing you Chicago's missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
Kidada's missing you Shock is missing you
Colleen is missing you Tiny is missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
By the way, Big we missing you Pac we missing you
We feel your presence just not in the physical
All across the world, blocks is miserable
Y'all left a void it's alot of little yous
But they not original and they not identical
They just studied your flows and they watched your interviews
That's when hip hop if it's not ten of you
Then it gotta be more, y'all left your paws
Footprints on the game hood ain't been the same
Feeling ain't been in music hooks ain't been the same
But I'm doing what I can man and try to follow y'all memory lane man
Big you be ashamed to see New York gangbang
Pac you feel the same thing they use your name in vein
But I guess that's the issue
And it proves how much, niggas really miss you

[Outro: Jay-Z] + (Aaliyah)
Pun we missing you Big L we missing you
Left Eye we missing you Jay we missing you
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah, Scott La Rock, the list goes on..
The world is missing you the hood is missing you
(Wondering if your the same and who's been with you)
Nah mean, miss y'all (I miss you)
This goes, to the memory of all our fallen soldiers
Soldiers and soldiettes all across the world (I miss you)
We gon' hold y'all down, y'all live in our memories forever
We never gon' let y'all go

[Aaliyah] + (Jay-Z)
I, can't, breathe, no, more (We not remembering y'all death though!)
Since you went away (We celebrating your life)
I don't really feel like talkin, don't wanna hear you love me (Nah mean!)
Baby (Yes!) do you understand me (Yes!)
I can't do a thing without you (Damn we missing you)
Wondering if your the same and who's been with you, I miss you
Wondering if your the same and who's been with you, I miss you</pre>
