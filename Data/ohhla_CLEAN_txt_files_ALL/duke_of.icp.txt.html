Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Well my name's Violent J and I don't mow ya grass
But I smack fat hoes on they swollen ass
I'm the cotton candy man. What's ya flava?
Psychotic, dig my behavior
I might chew heads off like a Jabbawocky
You deserve it, back up off me
I'm no team playa, Fuck the cause
The only sensitive thing about me is my balls
When I flunked second grade
I was already out on the streets gettin paid
I'm the duke of the wicked
The duke of the wicked
Plannin in good never getting evicted
On the Southwest side, me and DJ Clizzay
Wit Shaggy 2 Dope I'm Violent Jizzay
Psychopathic in a major wizzay
The duke of the wicked is here to stay
I'm The duke of the wicked
The duke of the wicked
Way up in ya momma bootyhole ima stick it
The D-U-K-E

I'm the Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
I'll probley throw a punch at ya face
If you all in The duke of the wicked's space
