[Raekwon]
Days that fly through the mist, so young and so rich
Powerful minds, the lines get intense
Wall to wall, cats in hell, so many trapped lost
Some will prevail and get clapped off in jail
Families mentally dyin', the roads is narrow
Jump out, bow and arrow, hit you with science
Huh, we've been livin' this daily
The wiz know what it is, that's why the vision is more clearly
War between money and lust, trust me, I hit enough dust
Suade fronts, color schemes, truck rings, stuck kings
Suade fronts, Balley's and blunts
Living amongst thieves, all we did was robbin', we won, Marvin

[Outro: Marvin Gaye sample (Raekwon)]
Hey baby, what you no good? (That's right lord)
And trusted and back with, it's me I want
(Niggas gotta cut this faggot millennium shit out right now)
War is hell (War is hell, and get real with life)
And will it be (start teachin' ya'll brothers, man)
When will people start gettin' together again</pre>
