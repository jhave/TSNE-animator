[Intro: Cappadonna, (Tekitha)]
{What's up? Where the music at?}
'donna and Tekitha (ohhhh... ohhhhh)
Big boys hold they weight and one shotty
(Noo... noo...) Killa-professionals, word
Pirates (Ohhh...) Murder on TV or on the CD
Bless me, Killa Bees, RZA paint
Yo, I could see, I could see

[Chorus x2: Tekitha]
I can see clear like a vision
No mystery to realize
The decision, no, no, no, no
is no longer in me...

[Cappadonna]
Yo, I could see, yo, I could see like owls in the night
Thieves' blindness no longer exist, uplift
Behold the life of a chemist, used to be a menace
but Don-Don never could form, my mind's like Anaconda
Never sore, forever see thru over the trees
Eyes like a bird, Jay Bird, best seen and best heard
W.T.C. never sold out for no body (no longer in me....)

[Tekitha]
Tryin to rush them, swing around me
Good an author, lies you told me
Now I can, now I can see...
(W.T.C., the best in the facility)
Never raise at harmony
Now I know I must simply release
That I did amd what's right
Changed my mind...
and recoginzed that only I can see me...
And you can't, can't deny it
That the things you've done effected me...
Ohh... I can see

[Chorus x2]

[Cappadonna]
Knowledge come first, regardless of the hardest
Some get trapped, some couldn't adapt
When the Wu-Tang Pillage came back, it's like life
Shed life, from a dart came a whole world
Clear like a vision, I'm inside of a pearl
with my whole heritage, we tight like panthers
Take chances and be the all eye seein
Donna and Tekitha, anti-easter
We 3 peice suit and tie, asiatic
See thru the bullshit, come with the static

[Tekitha]
I can see... clearly... yea...
My eyes have been opened to you now
Hey.. hey (I could see you clear like a vision)
Hey.. hey... still see clearly
I can see your ways and actions
You've shown me, I can see, I see
your ways and actions, you've shown me
Ohh... I can see

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
