[Intro: Damon Elliott (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
Yo, this is Damon Elliott, we got a lotta shit
Dame Dash, put me on game, baby
Purplelicious style, Macy Gray, Ol' Dirty Bastard
Who the fuck thought it would hit like this? (what? what?)
Where's my chain, baby, where's my chain? (Ohhhhhhhh, yeah)

[Chorus: Macy Gray (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
Don't go breaking my heart
(I won't be breaking your heart) You better not
They're gonna tear us apart, now, baby
(Don't wanna tear us apart) They better not

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I'll die for you, do time for you
Kill for you, that nigga was never good to you
Now that I'm out, what, you gonna do?
Let's get hot dogs on a steak, now (hot dogs on a steak)
Three drinks of lemon, fresh trip
Over the back of the backlands, king size bed
Filth all clean, let's do the do
All listening to Dionne Warrick singing "Deja Vu"
This is a dream that I was new

[Chorus]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Macy, and O.D.B., too hot for the chief, F.U.C.K.I.N.G.
That's what I'm gonna do with you baby (what's that spell?)
Let's go to the park, after dark
Ride some bitches, stab a bitch nigga
And get on your knees, leave behind you, atomic doggies
Then go to the movies, I don't care which movie
I just wanna get some popcorn, lick it softly

[Macy Gray]
Do you want some licorice, do you want some candy?
I wanna drink something outta you, while you sip some Ginger Ale
Hey, hey

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Damon Elliott (Macy Gray)]
Haha (yo, these for all the lovers out there) shut up
(Sh-shut up?) Shut the fu....

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard (Macy Gray) {both}]
Ooooh-hooo, nobody knows it, nobody knows
That when I was down (I was your crown)
Ooooh-hooo, nobody knows it, nobody knows
The life on the side (I gave you my heart)
{Ohhhhhhh-hooo, I gave you my heartttttttttttt}

[Bridge: Macy Gray (Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Don't go, go breaking my heart
Don't go... breaking it...
(I won't be breaking your heart) Don't go breaking it
They're gonna tear us apart, now, baby
(Don't wanna tear us apart) Don't go breaking it
Don't go... breaking it...  don't go... breaking it...
(I won't be breaking your heart) Don't go breaking it
Don't go... breaking it... don't go... breaking it...
(Don't wanna tear us apart) Don't go breaking it

[Outro: Macy Gray (Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Oooh, oooh (I won't be breaking your heart)
There's nobody faster, don't go breaking it
(Don't wanna tear us apart) Don't go breaking it
Hot dog on a steak, ooah-ooah, hahaha
(I won't be breaking your heart) Don't go breaking it</pre>
