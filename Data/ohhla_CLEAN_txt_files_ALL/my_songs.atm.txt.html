[Random guy singing]
Throw your hands up in the air
And wave like you just don't care
Say, you deserve a break today
Oh yeah, work that body, work that body
Make sure you don't hurt nobody
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear,
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hear
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?
I like the party rock the body
You like the party want somebody
I sang too, listen to the song..

[Verse 1: Slug]
Sittin' on the steps, with ANT, that's my man
Flippin' pig-russian, discussin' politics and contraband
Karma cut me clean as if I asked for it
Seven travels offered states with a case and fake passport
I want to shelter everybody from the snakes
And my sleeves know a couple of tricks for huntin' breaks
(Ten thousand lakes) Multiple choice of where to drown
So I quote the horse, it goes What floats is what's found"
Gettin down like they did in the 7-2
With the red and blue, had the opportune to bless you
Before you knew about a phone bill
Before you had to hold still
Before the Kool-Aid got diluted with Golden Seal
I used to ride around this town on a dirtbike
Child touched stillato, wild stages just to earn strikes
Read my lips, act like you heard right
And keep an eye on your chickI work my rubber like a turnpike
It ain't nothin' for me to come swing from your tree
I wear the love like a ring and I sing until it's free
What? You bringin the weed? We break a measure
And let the hook ride just to tie it all together
Whatever..

[Chorus: Slug]
My life ain't as cool as your life
And more than likely I'll be stabbed in my sleep by your wife
So everybody stop askin' me whats wrong
And quit actin' like you don't know the words to my songs

[Verse 2: Slug]
And when the party starts, I'm in the corner actin' smart
Spittin' game at your girl, just to take your world apart
I hang with the secrets and the cats that paint pictures
While you sleepin on life and writin the same scriptures
(What you gonna take witcha?) I take it all but the fall
And when I'm sittin still you can blame the Benadryl and alcohol
As far as the stars are above the boulevard
I keep my feet on the tar, with the heat in the car
Keep the beats in a jar, wait for the time to unleash
And when it comes everybody only gets one a piece
You better learn the words before you try to quote 'em
I'm sittin' on mixed nuts, who wants to hold 'em?

[Chorus: Slug]
My life ain't as cool as your life
And more than likely, I'll be stabbed in my sleep by your wife
So everybody stop askin' me whats wrong
And quit actin' like you don't know the words to my songs

[Verse 3: Slug]
Now let me get a collective amen (amen)
I put tame on the monsters the moment that I came in
I talk to the voices-- that speak through my headphones
Communicate the life while I just cipher all the info
I got styles I ain't even heard yet..
Words like rain and game, that left the earth wet
Let it drip-dry, focus eyes on the catalysts
Standin' high in the middle of SOUTH MINNEAPOLIS
They try to figure it out, they try to break it down
But they're distracted by every accent that's makin a sound
Grab it by the throat, lift it up and shake it 'round
Till this whole world sees me as a naked clown
And while I'm pullin on her bra, shes
Tuggin on my drawstring,
Screamin' and shoutin to figure out how you lost me
Chewin up my cigarette and smokin' my gum
Out of respect for your boyfriend, I'll use my thumb
From the start to the done, I never claimed to be right
I quit sleepin, now the day looks the same as the night
And I'm the type of DJ that only plays what I like
A handful of mixed nuts, everyone's takin a bite..

My life ain't as cool as yours (3X)

[Chorus: Slug]
My life ain't as cool as your life
And more than likely I'll be stabbed in my sleep by your wife
So everybody stop askin' me whats wrong
And quit actin' like you don't know the words to me songs

I'm alright, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm OK, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm alright, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm OK, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm alright, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm alright, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm OK, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm fixed up, and I'm tryin to get my dick sucked..
