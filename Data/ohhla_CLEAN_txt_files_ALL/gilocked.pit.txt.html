[GOD] Pitch Black nigga
[Foxy Brown] Brooklyn Stand up, young, prim what up baby, pitch black motherfucker
[GOD] Lil homie where you at
[Foxy Brown] Fox five

[GOD]
In my trunk got the sewed off shotty, paul shivy
Living room look like the world shy a lobby
Only got coupes, I don't like dudes behind me
Right beside me is the clutch and a mommy
A new york nigga like gida and giyombi
Got more niggaz then ghandi, thats grimmy
Now try me, with a spot of cuban, where you can't find me
Im quicker then the blink, a clock can't time me
I got the feds eyeing me, cause my music moving like blow
Cause rap feinds buy me, when you hear me, rewind me
Cause imma set the booth on fire till I'm fucking ninty

[Foxy Brown]
Live from D and D its your youngin FB
Big gun cocked fox and I'm running through the spot, nigga
Bear brah and we reppin The K, pitch black, young brown in the chrome SK, nigga
Eye fox AKA black child, watch fever hit the spot, and spread like small pox, whoa
Ass fat, pussy hot, I keep my little glock pump cocked, ill kill your ass clock
Me and Prim the unbeatable team, fox five cock sucker respect me in this bitch
When I come through bitchs gotta bow to the king bitch of rap, cock sucker I'm back

[Chorus]
Pitch black got it locked for sure, Tuck your chains and lock your doors
(Its on with the squad come get some nigga) (know a brother stay mad hungry)
Pitch black got it locked for sure, Tuck your chains and lock your doors
(Its about to go down) (don't stop don't quit)

[Zakee]
Yo I got courage, my fam call me johnny bravo
You a snitch nigga like donny brasco
Your rap from the back with a dirty rasco
My fam sell weight, wholesale like castco
Its desire and I fear no man
Y'all niggaz walk through the valley of death and hold hands
Ive been through it, my hormones don't sacret fair fluids
Trip niggaz your face turn blueish
Mouth get dry, eyes turn wide, might as well kneel down and cry chump wheres your pride
Success is mesuared respect, all killers ain't rich but they all got a rep nigga

[Devious]
My money is funny my change is strange my credit ain't gonna cut so I back out ?debts?
Devoius black seal spit murder dub ill
If I don't feed my duaghter karin, then who the fuck will
I don't trust bitches as far as I can throw em
Niggaz think they know D but they don't really know em
Gun em down and throw em I'm just keepin it basic
Put em in the basement, jim start face-lift
Death is in the air I can taste it, but I'm stuck in my ways, I gotta get paid today
D do it nothing to it, nigga don't act stupid
When it comes to the street shit, I am the truist

[Chorus]
Pitch black got it locked for sure, Tuck your chains and lock your doors
(Its on with the squad come get some nigga) (know a brother stay mad hungry)
Pitch black got it locked for sure, Tuck your chains and lock your doors
(Its about to go down) (don't stop don't quit)
Pitch black got it locked for sure, Tuck your chains and lock your doors
(Its on with the squad come get some nigga) (know a brother stay mad hungry)
Pitch black got it locked for sure, Tuck your chains and lock your doors
(Its about to go down) (don't stop don't quit)</pre>
