[Intro: Silkk the Shocker + (Snoop Dogg)]
Hey yo Snoop
Tell Xzibit and Dre to be havin' that thing bumpin' when I come out there 

(That's funky Soopafly..
 Big Snoop Dogg  {Snoop Dogg!}
 Silkk the Shocker 
 Ain't No Limit to this
 2000 
 Gangsta shit 
 West West ya'll)

It's my second home...
Snoop tell 'em what's up 

[Snoop Dogg]
The gangstas bang, do that damn thang 
Me and my nephew, Dogghouse keep it true 
Roll that weed - pass that drank 
Holla at your nigga, baby bring your thang 
You could shake what you got, get your pussy real hot 
Jump in the 'gator we could slide to my speezot 
Just keep it on leezy, I know it ain't easy 
You bucket mouth breezy
Silkk this bitch cute, thick and all that (damn)
"Why must I, chase the cat" 
If you was me (me), and I was you (you)
You'd probably floss on a nigga 
Burnin' rubber in a 52 
Most bitches do, and most niggaz do too
In the land where it's all about the red and blue 
But me - I'd rather get the greenery 
And smoke out the whole motherfuckin' scenary

[Chorus]
Pop lockin' in my Rolls Royce, Cadillac
Lincoln and Mercedes Benz
Pop lockin' at the Howard Johnson, the Sheraton
Pop lockin' at the Holiday Inn
Pop lockin' in my Rolls Royce, Cadillac
Lincoln and Mercedes Benz
Pop lockin' at the Howard Johnson, the Sheraton
Pop lockin' with all my friends

It's that West Coast way we're livin'
(Money, cars, weed, bitches)
It's that West Coast way we're livin'
(From the South to the West)
It's that West Coast way we're livin'
(Money, cars, weed, bitches)
It's that West Coast way we're livin'

[Goldie Loc]
Why must I, be like that 
With them ???? tux, draped in all black 
Takin' back like the pop lockin' ???? gold suits 
Bangin' back in the day just to get a lil' jucie 
Fuck the trus'
Cause we can get Cripped out crazy 
Blast on all you suckas, went to throw away 380 
Fuck around get found up in a dumpster somewhere 
Cause them Southside-Eastside gangstaz don't care 
Nigga I won't, fool you don't (know you don't)
He fuckin' with no niggaz more gangsta than me 
Tell him the truth loc 
120 proof outs the sun roof 
Throwin' up the motherfuckin' ????
Tru Tank Doggs fuckin' with Bigg Snoop Dogg 
Soopafly to keep them high so they could come out there draws 
What you player hatin' perpitrator niggaz make me mad 
So I'm mad off you suckas and my pants never sag 

[Chorus]

[Silkk the Shocker]
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party, you know who we bring 
No Limit and Dogghouse, ain't nothin' but a G thang 
You know, we think to win 
Y'all think money's soft, nah y'all better think again 
Cause if ain't about money, then why would I bother?
If she ain't keepin' it real, then why would I holla?
Til' she come swim by the crib with the house, come with the lake 
Eat as much as you want to as long as you know what come with the plate 
On my lap a fo' five, in the trunk - keep a K
In the deck P, Snoop, Biggie, Pac, fool just keep up Dre
And the heat I got on me, always gotta ride with it 
I don't spend money, fool I spend money cause I can - die with it
Project nigga, huh, get my work on
Host MTV with a Eastsidaz shirt on 
Ghetto like that, you know how we live 
On the East it's 6 feet, on the West it's 3 wheels

[Chorus]


[Outro: Silkk the Shocker]
Soopafly, No Limit
My nigga Xzibit, Bad Azz, Eastsidaz Gang
Doggy's Angels, Dogg Pound, and Damian Young
Cube, Westside, my nigga Marv, what up Eminem?

(Silkk the Shocker baby, and Bigg Snoop Dogg
 Bow-wow!
 It's another one of those - Dogghouse, No Limit, Soopafly
 Somethin' for your ear</pre>
