Song:   Movin' On
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

So if the role (so if the role) don't fit me
Got to be movin' on

I be a typical kind of girl
Wasting my time
That ain't my style
See I'd rather be occupied
Always trying to keep my mind

Pointing to a higher place
I can have anything I want
I been told the day I was born
So I make sure everyday
That I don't let nothing hold me back
Got to be on track
I gotta move

[CHORUS:]
So if the role don't fit me got to be moving on
Cuz if it don't work for me
Guess I'll be movin' on

Hey I could take liberty
But that would cause me a change
And that aint' my thang
Cuz I don't to stand with the crowd
Only true to myself
Don't have a follow to no one else
Not trying to be alone
But if the fact doing wrong
Got no problem leaving the room
Don't feel no sympathy
At least not for me
Cuz I know just what I am going to do
I gotta move

[REPEAT CHORUS (2x)]

Keep Movin' on
Keep Movin' on
Keep Movin' on and on

[REPEAT CHORUS (3x)]
