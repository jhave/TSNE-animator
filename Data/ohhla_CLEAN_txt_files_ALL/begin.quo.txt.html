[Stat Quo]
Feel like fresh air, woo!
... I can breathe
Long time comin
Let us begin (OWWWWW!)

This is "Statlanta" with no Em and no Dre
Just nothin but that muh'fuckin A (OKAY!!)
They can't keep him away, he's too resourceful
Gettin that guap with the glock by my torso
The young terror from the crack era
I turn never to a guarantee; God speaks through me
This is my bio, read my life
Tune your ears to my soul, let my music bring light
No hype, no gimmicks, Obie told me
There's no love in this game, most niggaz O.D.
on the fame and the chains, but I remain sane
With my feet and my body engulfed in the flames
First album but it feels like the third
Countless mixtapes, I'ma grind on the curb
Stood strong when the bullshit occured, that's my word
I am what the hood prefered, listen hurr
A magazine can't make him or break him
I'm still the future, XXL's mistaken (YEA!)
It's trouble when the monsters awaken
The top spot vacant, it's mine for the takin
Throwback flow, no breakin
Ol' zone swag off in Beverly, Hills I'm cakin
On the cover of magazines, niggaz hatin
The game lack creativity, they just tracin
No equals, too lethal, hear me people
This is just a preview, stay tuned for the sequel (part two!)
I saw past what the rest couldn't see through
I am the young beast; it's time that I feast
Fuck niggaz retreat, may you forever sleep
where the maggots and the earthworms eat, this is murder on beats
Have a seat, feel the power when your leader speak
Havin money's so bittersweet
It's like a double-edged sword when the blade and the flesh meet
These so-called best rappers lookin like fresh meat
Yeah, so it's time to dine
And I ain't ask niggaz shit, I'm just takin mine
Rhyme for rhyme, song for song, line for line, show for show
The survey say Stat Quo (Stat Quo)
Those that don't know don't matter bitch
And if you don't understand just listen to this
YEA!</pre>
