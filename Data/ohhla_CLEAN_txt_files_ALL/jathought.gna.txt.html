Song:   Just a Thought

(Verse)
All I want is your understanding
As in the small act of affection
"Why is this my life?"
Is almost everybody's question

(Hook)
And I've tried
Everything but suicide
But it's crossed my mind

(Verse)
I prefer peace
Wouldn't have to have one word of possession
But essentially I'm an animal
So just what do I do with all the aggression?

(Hook)
Well I've tried
Everything but suicide
But it's crossed my mind

(Verse)
Life is a one-way street, and if you could paint it
I'd draw myself going in the right direction
So I go all the way - like I really really know -
But the truth is I'm only guessin'

(Hook)
And I've tried
Everything but suicide
Oooh but it's crossed my mind
Just a thought

(Verse)
It's even dark in the daytime
It's not just good - it's +Great Depression+
When I was lost I even found myself
Looking in the gun's direction

(Hook)
And so I've tried
Everything but suicide
But yes - it's crossed my mind
But I'm fine</pre>
