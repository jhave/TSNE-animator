[Scott Storch]
What you thought, I was just gonna sit back and let shit ride?
Timothy... shit ain't sweet, you can't talk shit about a boss
Keep my name out ya mouth
Scott Storch... pussy

I'm the piano man (yes), the piano man
Few hun'ed million and I'm headed for a billion
You's a steroid man, so pathetic man
I coulda played you but I tried to be the better man
Ya boy Danja gotta hate you with a passion, man
He makes the hits while you takin' all the credit, damn (damn)
I know the feelin' I'm witcha
Won't you tell 'em how I made that shit "Cry Me A River"?
But you try to lose weight, try to gain some respect
Still ain't lose that pack of franks out the back of ya neck (haha!)
What's funny, my dude, is I just signed Maganoo
For ten bucks and he told me he was mad at you
I ain't no pussy, dawg, I'm gettin' at you
Why you bitchin'? Who beatjacked who?
Jimmy fronted you Nelly to get his money back
Cuz everything you sign to Beat Club is fuckin' wack

[Chorus - Nox]
You ain't gangsta, don't push me
You ain't got a pass in the hood to talk shit like that
You ain't a killa, you's a producer
Better keep his name out ya mouth
You ain't built like dat
(Keep my name out ya mouth)
(Keep my name out ya mouth)
(Keep my name out ya mouth)
You ain't built like dat
(Keep my name out ya mouth)
(Keep my name out ya mouth)
(Keep my name out ya mouth)
You ain't built like dat

[Nox]
I'm about a minute and a half from hurtin' ya whole staff
By the way, I heard you like to get it up ya ass
And I know who doin' the fuckin', but I ain't sayin' nothin'
What goes around can't come back around when I'm bussin'
Five hun'ed a track, where ya Bugatti at?
Homie you ain't built like dat, so lean back
And Danjahandz made 'em for you, I give him dat
But I gotta give you this, for talkin' like a bitch
My nigga had Grammys before y'all settle with that whip
Couple days later he got rid of that piece of shit
I give a fuck if you rich, to me you still a fag
Them popcorn beats ain't street, they in drag
Come see me in north Philly, I make that ass strip
Now you can sample drum rolls from my banana clip (brrraa!)
I had that ass runnin', screamin' "I'm so gold"
Cuz NOX done made ya icebox hot as a stove

[Chorus - Nox]
You ain't gangsta, don't push me
You ain't got a pass in the hood to talk shit like that
You ain't a killa, you's a producer
Better keep his name out ya mouth
You ain't built like dat
(Keep my name out ya mouth)
(Keep my name out ya mouth)
(Keep my name out ya mouth)
You ain't built like dat
(Keep my name out ya mouth)
(Keep my name out ya mouth)
(Keep my name out ya mouth)
You ain't built like dat

[Nox]
Holla at 'em

[Scott Storch]
Know you goin' for that bullshit in them interviews talkin' shit about me

[Nox]
Fake ass, don't apologize, nigga

[Scott Storch]
You can't even fuckin' make ya damn label work
Shit ain't sell ever for you (damn)
Them motherfuckers give you an artist
You ain't Dr. Dre, you don't know how to pick talent (no)
Or know how to sell records, or even make your own fuckin' beat
And you can't rap
Fuck outta here
And try to perpetuate this little bullshit
And give you any more attention than you deserve

[Nox]
We know that ain't you on that motherfuckin' icebox record, nigga
(haha)
Fake ass motherfuckers</pre>
