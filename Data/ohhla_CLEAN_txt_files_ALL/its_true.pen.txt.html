Song:   It's True
Typed by: jam3s16@hotmail.com

Intro:
Yeah, it's 97 going into 98
And I've been doin' this for mad years, payin' dues
This is my heart, my purpose in life
And finally I'm on
Which brings me to realise that the tough life that I had only made me 
stronger, ...TRUE

Chorus: Richard Stites
A ha ha ha ha
I know this much is true
A ha ha ha ha
I know this much is true

Verse One:
Growin' up didn't want to have nothing to do wit' you
Make you hittin' everybody went to high school wit' you
Wanna play you close and jump in the pool wit' you
I don't know what to do but this much is true
And in the hood, they all like to knock your career
And turn right around when you hot a gear
I played Midas and told them that it's God I fear
That the man upstairs, he control this here
And it's funny how, soon as the money piles
Everybody wanna play with that brother now
Run me down, but when the doe gets low, only a few friends roll, you know
And Mama, bless her heart, she used to give me strife
Said "Lynisse, please do something with your life"
And how it's gon' play out, I don't have a clue
All I know is this much is true, ...TRUE

Repeat Chorus:

Verse Two:
And I remember when, I used to feen for calls
When I hit number one I had to scream out calls
Used to see my Mama strugglin', worn from work
Told her when I made it big she never goin-a work
I used to wish at night that my brothers in the street
Hustlin', shit, they would live to the light
And see another day somehow, find another way I vow
To all my soldiers I hold you down
&gt;From standin' in the rain to the rovers now
I'm screamin your name to warn you that the rollers is around
To on-stage throwin' it down
No matter where you at represent your hood
No matter where I'm at I'm representing my hood
And how it's gon' all play out I don't have a clue
All I know is this much is true, ...TRUE

Repeat Chorus:

Verse Three:
I've opened up my eyes to a brighter day
Nobody in the block gave their life away
We all tryin' to take it easily
And everybody wanna make it seems is free
Today it's all good and it seemes so strange
Since you look up in the hood now things done changed
Kids they used to be wheelies for blocks,
Is out ridin' their bikes, doin' wheelies for blocks
And bitches on the bench, still gossipin', who's she slidin' in
Who's she slidin' with, outside partyin'
Old timers in the back playin' dominoes
Kids freestyling, all kinds of flows
Girls flow through with designer clothes
It's day now but you know how nightime goes
And how it's gon' play out I don't have a clue
All I know is this much is true... TRUE

Repeat Chorus Untill End...

...you know it's TRUE!</pre>
