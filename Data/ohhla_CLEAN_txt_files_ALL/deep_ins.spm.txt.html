[Three Minutes and Fourteen Seconds of an instrumental]

Yo man, a nigga gotta say SOMETHIN' to this track man,
I hate to interrupt y'all boys freestyle,
But we do it like this:

First (and only) Verse:

Muthafucka lay back,
In your cadillac,
Let me jump in your trunk like back to back,
Stay real for life, roll down South,
Fixin' to wreck shop for the home town crowd,
My alias, be that South Park Mexican,
Flowin' through your veins like medicine,
You got freestyle?  Wanna be down?
Real ballers, fight for the rebound
G-Town, to muthafuckin' B-Town,
Creep around, everybody G'd out,
I can't see how, you could take me out,
I'll "PEEYOW" and make a dog "Meow",
Deep South, my hood got more slack,
Than 88 cowboys ridin' on horseback,
Top that, ha, the Mexican's all that,
Strike like a snake and attack like a Bobcat,
Like Capone on the microphone,
You be me and leave that pipe alone boy.

Huh....
H-Town represent, and we can do it like this...
Or we can do it like that....
Much love.</pre>
