Light is in the air right now
Two thousand and two rebel music
The saga continues
Listen, children

What's the problem in Manhattan
Every ten men they look like Bin Laden
So I have problems when I go to the airport
First thing they do they wanna ask me for my passport
The said Wyclef we love the Fugees the score
But did anybody give you any strange package to bring on board
I was like 'no'
Here comes your national guards
This look like a scene from the movie Star Wars
One foot in, one foot out standing in the airplane
I'm on tour
I'm on my way to Japan
First class, dark shades
Let the fuschia out bed
I want to sleep but keep my eyes on the cock pit
Why just think they stay target- the pilot
We gonna take over the plane
Like the Los Angeles riot
Riot
Riot
The Middle East
The Middle East
The street pack more heat than the Middle East
The Middle East
The Middle East
When will the violence sleep in the Middle East
The Middle East
The street pack more heat than the Middle East
The Middle East
The Middle East
When will the violence
Say peace
Say peace
We don't want no war no more
Let me hear the streets
Peace, oh peace
We don't want no war no more
Let me hear the Middle East now
Peace, now peace, oh peace, oh peace
We don't want no war no more
Let me hear the USA say peace
Say peace
Lord, peace
We don't want no war no more
We don't want no war no more
We don't want no war no more
We don't want no war no more
We don't want no war no more
We don't want no war no more
We don't want no war no more
Ay, peace
Oh peace
We don't want no war no more
No, no let me hear you say
Peace, peace,
Say peace, say peace
We don't want no war no more
No, no, no, no
Say peace, oh peace
We don't want no war no more
No more riots
Riots
