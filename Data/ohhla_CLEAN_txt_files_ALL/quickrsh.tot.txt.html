Uh, boy, you just don't know what you do to me
Uh, you see you need me in places where no one has ever been
Uh, and no one will ever go
But you, oh, ooh, oh

Uh, one, uh, uh, two, uh, uh, three, uh, uh

Boy, oh boy, when are you coming home to me
(when are you coming home to me baby, uh)
Cause I've been lying here with my thongs on
With my pretty drawers on, thinking how we used to be
Do you remember how it used to be
I said boy, oh boy, when are you getting out of jail
(jail, when you gettin out of jail baby)
With no bail, uh
Cause I been backed up, really backed up
And I'm ready like want to do your body good like milk
(I could do your body good like milk)

Baby, baby when you touch me, you give me a quick rush
And I really wanna meet you, I cry cause I miss you much (oh, oh)
Every minute that you're far away from me, so much pain
When I reminisce about us makin' love it makes me scream (ow)

Boy, oh boy, uh, I can't wait to see your face, uh
I can't wait to see you baby, uh
There's no other that can do it better than I do it
Cause baby I'm the bait, baby, I'm the bait
I say, uh, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
You got me sho nuff losin' my mind
(I'm going crazy, I don't know why baby, uh)
And I been waitin', anticipatin'
While you regulatin', don't make me wait long time
oh yeah baby, don't make me wait
Baby when

Baby when you touch me, you give me a quick rush, yeah
And I really wanna meet you, I cry cause I miss you much (oh, yeah)
Every minute that you're far away from me, so much pain (mmhm)
When I reminisce about us makin' love it makes me scream (ow)

Baby, baby, baby, I need you in my life
I need you in my life, babe
When you're gone, when you're gone
It be blowin' my high, it be blowin' my high, baby
Honey when you're coming home, when you're coming home, oh yeah
Cause darling, I'm sick of being alone, uh

Baby when you touch me you give me a quick rush
And I really really want you, I cry cause I miss you much
Every minute that you're far away from me so much pain
When I reminisce us makin' love it makes me scream, ow, ow</pre>
