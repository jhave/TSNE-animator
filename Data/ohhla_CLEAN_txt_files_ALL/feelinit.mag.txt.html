[Kool Keith]
Now here's a funky beat, my rhyme is updated
For soft ducks, I played it once
A biter jumped on it
Girls got stupid, freaks humped on it
And from the back, I pumped on it
mostly, with skill, top finesse
East to West, but I guess, I'm right
while others are wrong
Tryin to teach, and usin my song
along, with your wiggedy-wack
Stay back, get back, sit back down
and think about it, whenever you're dissin me
You are the roach, the six legs wishin me
and pushin me, steadily on
Metaphor, better for, psychin more
On my tour, brains are sore
I'll be sure, I'm fresher
So tell me how I..
duck, wack rappers around
In town, never wearin no boots
Toy Bally, sharkskin suits
Rip a story, and threw his auditory
Canal Street, is my territory
For gold glory, reachin my hand
to smack rappers, and makin em stand outside
waitin for me, to tell them, my secret style
And show them, how really it's done
My son, now I'm back to you
And if you're bad I'll smack you too
A glass of rhymes, shattering
Now you're cut up, say what up?
Shut up, cause I'm feelin' it

[TR L.] Yo that was dope!
"You've got the feelin"
[Keith] Whattup Trev I'm runnin America about right now
	Whassup with Ced Gee
"You've got the feelin"
[TR L.] Yo, Ced, you ready to get on and tell em how you feel?
[C.Gee] Yeah word up, bust this
	Man I'ma do this
"You've got the feelin"
	I might as well go do this right?
[TR L.] Definitely man
[C.Gee] Aight, do it

[Ced Gee]
Hello!  I'm back again
It's Ced Gee, the champion
of knowledge and wisdom over all topics
I'm the chief, the general prophet
Topping, all the ducks who are delerious
about rhymin, I'm more serious
Like this, with twists as changes
I took time, and rearranged this
style like how versatile you ask me now wow
I'm like ??
The movie, you seen on TV
I'll be numerous, but believe me
I'll chop you up, bash your brain, rotate your liver
Then I'm gonna give ya, a fresh rhyme, maybe
Sealed and delivered, by me
The manufacturer
Straight out of Attica, I come after ya
And if ya run, I have to damage ya
mentally, by using my mind
Choosing adjectives hard to define
in rhymes, a dictionary wordpiece
From the Brainiac, I blew your domepiece
open, hopin you'll say to me
"That was dope," like an anatomy
operation on the turntables
Slicing nerds with verbs, fully enabled
Equipped, with a white handkerchief
to wipe away the germs who wanna hang with this
Ultra smoker, dope man, no joker
With the line I wrote, and I quote them
Cause I'm feelin' it!

"You've got the feeling"
[C.Gee] I feel it.. one more time man
"You've got the feeling"
[Keith] Just another Boogie Down Bronx sure shot
"You've got the feeling"
[C.Gee] Word up, 4-3 Mission posse in effect
"You've got the feeling"
	To my man Tim Southfield
	? my next door neighbor
	Hollywood House family
	Oh the whole 9 crew, Dexter, everybody
[TR L.] Brother Kevvy Kev, brother Kev
	Keith, Brother Kevvy Kev is in effect
[C.Gee] Yo Calvin what's up?
[TR L.] Jungle Brothers, Violators, the whole family man
[C.Gee] London
