[Intro: Skylar Grey]
And the wheels go around, and round, and round...

[Skylar Grey]
If you got a sweet tooth
You can taste my watermelons
If the swing set bores you
I can show you all my talents
I can wear a taaaaan
Like other bitches caaaaan't
You can have all this, boy
And there's only one thing that I want from you

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
C'mon let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical, on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby after all, it's only natural
Feel it comin, comin, comin, OHH!
Feel like runnin, runnin, runnin, OHHHH!
C'mon let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical, on your bicycle
WHOA!

[Interlude: Eminem]
You want to ride my bicycle
You want to ride my bike
Haha

[Skylar Grey]
If the world starts freezing
I can make it hot and humid
If you get a bee sting
I can suck out all the poison
I can make you laaaaast
Like other bitches caaaaan't
Have I made it clear, boy?
There's only one thing that I want from you, HEY!

[Chorus]

[Skylar Grey]
I'm only fucking with you
Fuck you for thinking it's true
I'm not like the sluts in this town
They make me BLECH in my mouth
I wanna ride on your bike
Cause you're the boy that I like
It's like I'm a sell-out for you
But your bike's so shiny and new (shiny and new)

[Eminem] + (Skylar)
She's distracted, by my reflectors, man I can this chick's attracted
My wheels SPOKE to her, my Schwinn is a chick magnet
Baggin up chicks like a bag of chips
with a bag of prophylactics as big as Mick Jagger lips
Shaggin's, somethin I'm a pro at, but I ain't practicin shit
(Allen) Iverson of safe sex, condoms are for practice, man I {skip practice}
Flip backwards while I flip this bike on its banana seat
My fantasy's to have you land where the kickstand is
Got this bitch gaggin, they call me the broad killer
I'm the cousin of Godzilla
Cause I spit fire and my dick's draggin/dragon
Zig-zaggin up the avenue pullin these chicks in my antagonist, wagon
Screamin

[Chorus]

[Outro: Eminem]
You want to ride my bicycle
You want to ride my bike
You want to ride my bicycle
You want to ride my bike
Haha</pre>
