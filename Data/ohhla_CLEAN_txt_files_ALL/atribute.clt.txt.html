[Brolik]
Authentic I'm livin' proof no lies I give you truth
It's an addiction alcohol abuse
I used to drink till' I would lose composure
Fifteen I handled a Jack Daniels with no cola
Now I'm twenty plus with an ulcer
Rehab didn't keep me clean didn't like who I was when I was sober
Fuck your AA meetings surgery is next If my ulcer starts bleedin'
I don't care that's what the people around me are seein'
I should be concerned about my health
But I'm still drinkin' I need help
Sometimes I don't be thinkin' depression gets to me
But it never fails O E was my dependency
No matter how much it burned I was able
To drink anybody under the table I've turned
Into the man my father is I've learned
How to handle my liquor straight no mixture
Don't be concerned I know what I'm doin'
Is it safe with all this alcohol my body's consumin'
A cold beer out the fridge there's nothin' more soothin'
No regrets this is the life I'm choosin'

[Yendi]
My pen, my rhymes, and my book
I'm now shook
We all see the truth
Painted out with the plagues
And now I'm stuck with the truth

[Brolik]
You might not know pain I don't show A hard shell
Not even Chapelle could make me laugh
Too sad I just found out Moms was sick
Anemic look at her weight she got thin
But she's beautiful look at her face my mother
I don't say it as much as I should but I love her
I pray every time I wake before I sleep
Me and Pops don't get along we just started to speak
Look at your son so weak you raised me to be tougher
But it's painful everyday watching your Mom suffer
I'll try but I don't know how long I can be strong
Doctor what's wrong when will she recover
I stood by her side at the hopsital bed
Grandma was there pages from the Bible she read
She said a prayer and applied blessin' oil on my head
Before I left gave Moms a kiss on her forehead then I fled

[Yendi]
My pen, my rhymes, and my book
I'm now shook
We all see the truth
Painted out with the plagues
And now I'm stuck with the truth

My pen, my rhymes, and my book
I'm now shook
We all see the truth
Painted out with the plagues
And now I'm stuck with the truth

[Brolik]
Nobody can understand I've tried to explain
But nobody understood my pain I've came
to my senses no more alcohol binges
Mom is still fightin' her sickness
I got a brother doin' twenty for a body he didn't kill
No evidence not enough money to appeal
And five points sittin' in a maximum jail
His so called friends don't visit don't send any mail
I lost my little cousin on his older brothers birthday
Dunk driver gettin' chased by the police
Ran through the red light I wish that was me on that bike
He was fifteen never had a chance to see life
That night changed the lives of our fam it brought us closer
And you still have three sons aunt Rosa Me Corey and Kevin
Eddie was an angel he had to return to heaven
All we do now is cry and reminisce
I wish that I could see him one more time
The funeral was his it should've been mine

[Yendi]
My pen, my rhymes, and my book
I'm now shook
We all see the truth
Painted out with the plagues
And now I'm stuck with the truth

My pen, my rhymes, and my book
I'm now shook
We all see the truth
Painted out with the plagues
And now I'm stuck with the truth</pre>
