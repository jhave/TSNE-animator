Typed by: stillswish@yahoo.com

[Chorus]
Why you walk like that, 'cause I walk like that
I walk like that, 'cause I walk like that
Why you talk like that, 'cause I talk like that
I talk like that, 'cause I talk like that
Why you walk like that, 'cause I walk like that
I walk like that, 'cause I walk like that
Why you talk like that, 'cause I talk like that
I talk like that, 'cause I talk like that

[Verse 1]
Lil' mama ask me why I walk like that
Then she started hollerin at me so I holla right back, like that
She know I'm from Ratchet city and I'm ballin
She like the way I talk so she told me to keep talkin
I told her baby you could ride with a beast
Walk with a G, I'ma toss me a freak
She whispered in my ear sayin she used to be a stripper
She took me in the bathroom pullin on my zipper
I bent her over from the back and hit her with the missile
A beam, beam, beam, then I didn't mean to kiss her
I beat it out the frame, you know I'm Hurricane
Then I dipped off in the middle of the night in the rain switchin lane
Go Live Entertainment, see the gold bangin
Walk like that, 'cause I talk like that
I walk like that, 'cause I talk like that
All you 'pon that fakin better chill out, haha

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Look at my pants, look at my shirt, look at my shoes
Look at my feet, I walk like that, 'cause I talk like that
I walk like that, 'cause I talk like that
You just said the same thing, I just said the same thing
I'm from Louisiana, you can tell by the accent
Lamborghini doors on Impalas with the Phantom kiss
Pull up at the party, hop out and get it started
Plus I'm full of Bacardi, I think I'm gettin nauseous
Now I'm feelin retarded, lookin for a bar
To go get another (?) then I'ma get it started
Talk like I talk, and when I walk I be mobbin
And gun boppin can get you stomped, it ain't a problem

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I walk like this 'cause it's a lump in my pants
And when I hit the club, they call me the Money Man
I hit the V.I.P. that's when I spend a couple grand
Then I walk on the floor with a couple stacks in my hand
Lil' mama got to poppin and pullin out on my waist
That's when I took my shades off and let her see my face
The shirt that I got on the same brand as my cologne
The same ratchets on my phone, I can't help it I'm a dawg
I go harder than the average, take a trip to Paris
30 inches with candy paint on the Volkswagen
Pants stay saggin, can't help it I'm just ratchin
Money make me happy, hoes like my swag
And I get it from my daddy, black on black in that Caddy
Walk like this because I used to walk home
But now I walk to the parking lot to see I sit on chrome
26 this year, I'm sittin on that chrome
