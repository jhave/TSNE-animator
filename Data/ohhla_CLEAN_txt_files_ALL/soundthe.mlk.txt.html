Whoa
New Shit
Yo
Yeah
Go
This the one that gone get live on the club man
Matter of fact DJ turn it louder
Uh Uh
Turn it louder

From the floor to the ceiling
Detroit in the muthafuckin building
Destroy everything yo we killin
D-Boy on them big boy wheels yep
To cold to grab 
Even more like a photo lab
I'm a shoot something
Niggas fold when the gun go blast
Half ass rappers we just fold in half
Throw in trash
Might go pop like the go-go dancing
Go pose for the photo lens
And I still got more but
If you wanna go flow for flow or toe to toe we can go but
New year so I'm stopin lames
Can't give them fame so I'm not droppin names
Labels played the fools like they played to lose
I just played you dudes
Checkmate your moves
I'm a just give them two plus two bars
Niggas like ease of em Black
Please just cool off
Real music I crush gimmicks
Give it up naw
More like Willie Hunts with it

(2x)
Hands to the sky 
Get them high
Call up for help
This shit fire
Sound sound alarm
Sound the alarm
Sound sound alarm
Sound the alarm

Yeah 
To live for TV
(Get em Guilt) To real for radio
They hate the joint
But they'll play it though
(Why) The fans demand the man and I'm him
Chipped up watch and fresh Timbs
Throw em up high 
Gun for the spy
Tryin to catch wind like the spread wings on a fly
Nigga I
Solomnly swear to rep thorough men
Got em hooked like black tar heroin
Barrels in your mouth
We own the house 
Here to take my cut since your holdin out
I'm a brand new face wit a old school weapon
Hammer muthafucka yeah 3-5-7
I gotta feed my brethren
No excuses so withholding doe is useless
Be warned if you pay me light 
You better have something of value to make it right

(2x)
Hands to the sky 
Get them high
Call up for help
This shit fire
Sound sound alarm
Sound the alarm
Sound sound alarm
Sound the alarm
