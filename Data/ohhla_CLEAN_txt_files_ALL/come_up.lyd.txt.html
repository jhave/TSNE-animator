[Intro]
"And now for our feature presentation."

[Lloyd Banks]
Uh, ain't no time for slippin, captain of this boat
You in that water you don't listen, cause I gotta get the dough
I got the mind to get to it, look how I bomb through my music
These old niggaz must've forgot, they got Alzheimer's and stupid
I re-up, rhyme and recoup it, uhh, just look at my time
And I been shinin since Whoo Kid, uhh, nigga I'm grindin
Mountain climbin and I stay fresh
Dominate for business, now my name stretch
Same guy, grey sky, grade 9, great vest
Fuck it, roll up, that's the way I'm livin
Sucker niggaz baby-sittin for my favorite women
Pockets full of C-notes, memories full of I-O-U's
Lou' Vuitton peacoat, sleek will shut entire crew
Blue, plug and leave 'em, that's just how I do
Masterpieces every time I drew, Jeffrey Dahmer you
{?}, Dennis to McDonald fool
Boy don't bring the drama here, heat-seekers follow you
And you, and you

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It's about time a nigga come up, gritty for a lord
Ain't no runnin out you run up, ain't nuttin treated small
Mine clockin on the rundown, party 'til it's sun up
Foreign cars kitted - all these bitches gettin in it

[Lloyd Banks]
Uh, these niggaz can't see me, motherfuckin chief
Three different whores all in my teepee, which one am I gon' keep?
I got the blood of a playa, spend all the money you pay her
Got a mansion from music cause my flow nice as my neighbor
I hit the dope vein (dope vein) the "H.F.M." is flowin, goin Soul Train
+HAM+ all on the track in my new rope chain
Bottles of that co-paign, model mami Coke frame
Twenty bands stuffed in Trues, icy wrist, nuttin brews
Every month another cruise, closet damn near closin in
80, 90-somethin shoes, five colors of other Choo's
Big jewelry out in the open, so they wan' judge me
You know the verdict, young black with money so I'm some dummy
Racism, facets of what my grandma seen
Frontin down M.L.K., jammin while you play that scheme
Smoke in Lamborghin's, South Jamaica man of cream
Style out here'll get you stomped, turn your head to trampoline
Mean~!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
"November finally finds me here
 Just like the trees so cold and bare"</pre>
