(B-Real)
Huh, what you want?
What you want?
Want you want from me?
Tell me what, tell me what
Want you want from me, huh?
What you want?
Want you want from me?
Tell me, tell me, tell me dogs
Want you want from me?
What you want?
What you want?
What you want?
What you want from me?

(B-Real)
Want you want from me?
Wanna live my life
Drive my car, with my jewels, now you're holdin my wife
What you got for me -- FAME?
Opportunity I guess that ain't enough for ya
You want the loot and weed
What you need from me?
To bleed and die quickly
here I turn my back here's the knife, for you to stick in me
What you do for me?
Stab me in the back, preney
Over little shit you do, pretty hittin in me
What you done for me?
Robbery, pray the po'
Actin like it was my homie, just a fuckin phony
What you see in me?
A weakness so you can damage me
And dis-granite me so you can take advantage (yeah)
What you need to see?
The Nina milli six-a, show ya how I don't give a fuck about you
You talk now, what you need to be?
Runnin away from the leader
Before you're gettin warm by my heater

(Chorus: B-Real)
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you, what you
What you want, what you want from me?

(B-Real)
What you want from me?
Money and the record deal
free tickets to the shows and the free meal
What you got for me?
Besides, or your hang ups and sob stories
The violins play em baby
What you want to be?
Everything I am now, but you never worked for it
The live it, you fuckin gimmick
What you want -- disease?
For me and my homies
Niggas want to act, damn, you don't even know me
What you need to breathe?
To think it over clearly, you can hear me over the speaker
It's best you don't come near me
What you got for me?
Back up and a lot of weight, but now
you hatin on me, in every single way
What you have with me?
To make me turn the switcher
Funny how money makes a fuckin little picture
What it's got to be?
You get disconnected over methods you choose
To make yourself get ejected

(Chorus: B-Real)
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you, what you
What you want, what you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you, what you want?
What you, what you want from me?

(Sen Dog)
What you want from me?
Pictures and the demos
You wanna act funny?
And hear my layo
What you got to see?
I need a little privacy
you don't even know of the shit that drivin me
What you need from me?
Someone to put your shit on
never forget what I've done for you
Before you get on
What you have to be?
True to the family 
and fuck em and feed em 
if you ain't understandin me?
What you want to be?
Hard or a pop star
goin out and doin the same shit
that's a love song
What you want from me?
Nothin but burn riches down, I should grab your jaw
And knock it off the hinges now
What you after me?
Doctors and nurses and hearses
And the worst thing you feelin the blood curses
What you have to be?
Gone another memory
Remember this if I gotta choose over them or me
I'll choose me motherfucker you understand...

(B-Real)
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
Tell me what you want
What you want from me?
What you want from me?

(Chorus: B-Real)
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you, what you
What you want, what you want from me?</pre>
