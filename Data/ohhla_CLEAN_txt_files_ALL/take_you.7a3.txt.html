[ Frank Stallone ]
Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack
Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack

(Aaaah... ya!)

[ Bret E.B. (&amp; Sean E.B.) ]
(From the streets) cometh a man
(A fighter) doin the best that I can
(To survive) yes, and it's survival of the fittest
Strive for what is mine, the Lord is my witness
Many believe in what they see
(And I wonder) what do they see in me
For a man, he must walk alone
(To grow) and to bring his knowledge home
School of hard knocks is my alma mater
Lady Luck, you know that I got her
Fame and fortune never a concern
(I got mine) so to home I return

(Aaaah... ya!)

[ Frank Stallone ]
Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack

I'm gonna go to home sweet home

Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack

Take me to home sweet home

Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack

I wanna gooooooo

Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack

Take me home

[ Sean E.B. (&amp; Bret E.B.) ]
Touched many lives and seen many faces
Stood my ground in many different places
Mingled with the rich, a product of the poor
(Poor) in cash flow, and nothing more
(Pride) I'm proud of where I come from
(Friends) sometimes I thought I had none
Life is funny, it throws many curves
(Confusion) it gets on my nerves
Never thought about the pains and the tears
All I heard was the chants and cheers
You're a champ, now what you gonna do
(When it's true) you don't believe in you

(Aaaah... ya!)

[ Frank Stallone ]
Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack

...home sweet home

Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack

Take me hooooooooome
( ? )
Home again
Take me hooooooooome

[ Sean E.B. (&amp; Bret E.B.) ]
(A challenge) my nature is to meet it
If I quit, then the purpose is defeated
A gamble (you see I gotta take the chance
Or in the mirror at myself I cannot glance)
Never run and hide, gotta take a stand
(Or feel like a coward and I'll doubt the man
In myself) with that I cannot live
They takin all I have to give
Destined (for what I know
Search for answers, so in my soul I roll
In the beginning) everything was good
Age and wisdom (says I return to the hood)

[ Frank Stallone ]
Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack

I'm gonna go to home sweet home

Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack

So take me back to where I belong

Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack

I wanna go home sweet home

Take you back
