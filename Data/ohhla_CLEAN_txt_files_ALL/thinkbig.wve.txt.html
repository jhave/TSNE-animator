[talking]
Yo.. this the shit right here...
Yo, for my niggaz, think big (think big) get big (get big)
Get big... (*whispered* think big get big nigga)
Think big (yeah, come on)

[Shamus(?)]
Yo, yo, yo
You pay the price, we'll get ya club jumpin (jumpin)
Cop the brick, my nigga start pumpin (pumpin)
Cross the path nigga start thumpin (thumpin)
Try to hit me up ya gets nothin (nothin)
This black truck, tinted dark, nigga suit it up
MP two-thou, 100 bars, boot it up
We locate close to the Costa Rica, Rica
Daily move a hundred pounds of reefer, reefer
Ya think big, ya get big, ya think small, stay small
You ain't sure, we stay the fuck away from y'all
Hate me, I hate y'all, you want peace, I want war
Shot to ya face, hear the police nigga get the door
The ball dropped, tecs on cop, bottles pop
It's two-thou, we safe and never nigga hit the block

[talking]
Think big, get big...
...yeah, yeah, yeah, no doubt nigga

[Chorus: Raw]
Yo you think big, get big; think small, stay small
Still ain't sure, stay the fuck away from y'all
Think big, get big; think small, stay small
Still ain't sure, stay the fuck away from y'all
Think big, get big; think small, stay small
Still ain't sure, stay the fuck away from y'all
Think big, get big; think small, stay small
Still ain't sure.. stay the fuck away from y'all

[Karachi Raw]
Fuck them other niggaz, kickin bitch business
I figure they dig dick - our names out they mouth
every five minutes bitch; hit windpipes with this
So they can't come off, Raw bustin in they ears
Feel the killa dealer, get bigger, it's gets no realer
We never liftin nothin, work for light year figure
You don't love me - y'all seein cents and dollar signs
So we see y'all in the same motherfucker gimme mine
Equal with the numbers, we recruited this summer
I went, low on the hoe, that love to blow and trace numbers so
Take it easy, don't get hit up, hit up
Blow stama(?) that'll get you lit up, lit up
Pour liquor that'll kill ya liver, liver
Wiser killin got us gettin richer, and richer
Richer and richer, richer and richer
Killa - dealer - kill 'em; got to kill 'em off
No love without y'all, no peace without war
Battle yourself for all

[Chorus: Raw]

[Skar]
Straight out the Boogies for you crack-smackin rookies
Stackin like a bookie, rockin hoodies
Never was a goodie-goodie, so take this advice
Pay the price, pray to Christ, I'm worse than Poltergeist
It's not the bark it's the bite, my heart is trife
If y'all wanna brawl, I'm like six feet tall
Keep the piece in my drawers, the heat's raw
But ain't nuttin like C4, we ready for y'all
When the shanks get sawed ya legs and dogs
Caliente like hot sauce, slim but I'm not soft
I was taught, to hold four in fours
Bust off, if my dues a buck short
I harm for the cause, and my niggaz up North...

[Chorus: Raw]</pre>
