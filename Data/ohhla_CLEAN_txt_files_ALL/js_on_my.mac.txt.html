Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeh, uh, uh one time one time one time for your goddamn mind

[Hook]
Walkin thru this world with J's on my feet
J J's on my feet, j J's on my feet
Walking thru this world with J's on my feet
J J's on my feet, jjjjs on my feet
Walking thru this world with J's on my feet
Babes on my piece, slave on these beats walkin thru
This world with J's on my feet, j J's on my feet, j J's on my feet

[Verse 1]
Cuz its a banger 2 banger 2
Type of shit on pay per view butt naked she layin layin
Cuz she cant tame a zoo she wild she want my child
Don't touch that dial, I whisper in her ear it makes
Her smile, loud as I'm fuckin her
Smooth like I'm in love with her
Tingles up my spine everytime that I'm touchin her
I love her like pussy, money
Weed, when I'm hungry I will feed
So for dinner she cooks food with 4 different types
Of cheese, in the sheets we have dessert until it hurts
Feeling on her curves, I pet up on that pussy til it
Purrs, touch me touch me, I'm sure its her that loves
Me, cuz I could make the virgin mary fuck me
[?] trust me, mac like bernie
Having sex like will, fuck a freaky circus bitch while
She still wearin stilts, these J's on my feet and these
Babes on my piece, see I have a different girl for every day of the week

[Hook x1]

Girl mapquest my address to access my mattress
I get girls straight outta the pageant
No doubt that I'm smashin, I'm askin her name
You a masterpiece girl and that ass is just flame
She knows that I'm a rapper and her daddy's ashamed
Wont let her out the crib boy hes actin insane
She got that cute smile and she laugh at my name
But wanna roll with my people let mac get that brain
Yeah mac has that game so see how he plays it
I face piff rap to a girl and leave her anxious
Girls wanted me when I was chubby with some braces
I bet they like me now cuz I got money and I'm famous
The taste is delicious her lips give me kisses
Throw her in the kitchen and she making me some dishes
Her dinner ain't right, ill admit its smellin awful
That girl can make a batch of belgian waffles a jawful

[Hook]

Grab a ounce or bigger then I bounce like tigger
Count 3 dollars up and grab a pack of some swishers
I'm feelin' stoned got my cigarillo rolled</pre>
