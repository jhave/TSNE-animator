    (LL Cool J)
I didn't even know a young lady could look that good
I'm ready da bounce outa queens and come to your hood
I'm ready da change your life baby, spend some cash
Because you got me chinky eyed like blunts mixed with hash
When your in my ferrari, look at the seats carve your ass
L drive drunk baby, pass the glass
As we run up in the club politican with thugs
When your bra straps showin' baby girl it's love
'Cause you are the loose
Token and sippin' honeypoof
Cause you are the loose
Sweet as cranberry, peach snaps and apple-loops
Runnin' with Queens finest all the way to the top
Pass cars, hard dick and plenty money to shop

(Hook)

Take it off, Come on and dance with me baby
Take it off, There aint nobody who can fade me
Take it off, I'm on a hot-streak lately
Take it off, You know that ass look crazy
Take it off, You saw me up in that mercedes
Take it off, I know my crew look shady
Take it off, You see me spendin' dubs baby
Take it off, Watch me dance for you baby

Wo day drive is live, Monte Carlo was ill
Convertable limousines, def jam got the bill
Remember R. Kelly had the house on the hill
Well when the partys over we can go there and chill
In London it's Big Ben style breakfast in bed
In Paris you were on an Eifel Tower givin' me head
Go to Switzerland, private jets over the house
Come home, ghetto style, bend you over the couch
Real niggaz, nothin' but the platnium shit
Keep that ass soakin wet, plus I'm spendin' his chips
Who's fuckin' wit that, put your middle finger in the air
Has a jet pasion X-man playin' wit your hair

(Hook)

Take it off, Come on and dance with me baby
Take it off, There aint nobody who can fade me
Take it off, I'm on a hot-streak lately
Take it off, You know that ass look crazy
Take it off, You saw me up in that mercedes
Take it off, I know my crew look shady
Take it off, You see me spendin' dubs baby
Take it off, Watch me dance for you baby
Dance for me baby (x4)

To my man Black Jus baby RIP
Accesory to the crime is the prime dogg 3
When we get the money baby, spreadin' the cream
To tell your brother Joe to hold it down for Queens
And to my cousin Will, hold ya head nigga chill
J.T. Damon in the car let's get the squeels
My nigga Big Bonny Puff, glad your home
Rock the bells Melly Mell, Jimmy Love and Tone
Baby we live cats, lookin' at where in we rides at
Drug walls, hip-hop beats, how 'bout that
The rest fell so far, they can't climb back
Let's take it to the video-tape, rewind that

(Hook)(x2)

Take it off, Come on and dance with me baby (everybody in the club)
Take it off, There aint nobody who can fade me (word up)
Take it off, I'm on a hot-streak lately 
(champagne glass in the air baby)
Take it off, You know that ass look crazy 
(Just wanna pop it dog, word up)
Take it off, You saw me up in that mercedes (yeah yeah)
Take it off, I know my crew look shady (it's official, word up)
Take it off, You see me spendin' dubs baby
Take it off, Watch me dance for you baby

Take it off, Greatest of All Times. (x1)</pre>
