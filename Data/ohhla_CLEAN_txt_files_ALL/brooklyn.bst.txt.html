[Intro]
Hellohhhhh Brooklynnnnnnnn!

[Verse One]
New York, New York - it's a hell of a town
You know The Bronx is up and I'm Brooklyn down
Because they don't know my name - only know my initials
Buildin bombs in the attic for elected officials
I quit my job, I cut my hair
You know I cut my boss, because I don't care
You tried to get slick, you bust a little chuckle
You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle
Cause bein as fly as me is somethin that you never thought of
You'll be stickin up old ladies with the handgun or the sawed-off
I'm a buffalo soldier, broader than Broadway
Keep keepin on I don't care what they say
I play my stereo loud, I disturbs my neighbors
I want to enjoy, the fruits of my labor
Cause I am the holder of the three-pack bonanza
If you open the book then you will get your hand slapped
I am the keeper of the three-pack bonanza
If you ask a question, the you will get the answer
Her breasts, I saw, I reached, I felt
M, O-N, E-Y, the belt
I stay at home, just, like a hermit
I got the jammy but I don't got the permit
You know why? You got a boyfriend and his name is Nick
Annabelle caught with the shrimpy limp dick
I ride around town cause my ride is fly
I shot a man in Brooklyn ("just to watch him die")</pre>
