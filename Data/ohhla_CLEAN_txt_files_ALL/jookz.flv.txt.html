[Flavor Flav]
Yeah that's right, we gon' do it like this and like that
Y'knahmsayin, straight from the top
Ha ha ha, that's right it's your man Flavor Flav boy
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH snap, yeah like that, like that
Yeah, like that, what nigga what
We want all the money!
That's right we gon' do it like this once again
2005, comin live with no jive
That's right, KNOCK KNOCK, KNOCK KNOCK, word
Yo check one two

Check out the jookz, neighborhood crooks that plot
Schemin on a comfortable spot that's got new locks
The L train, Friday night 11 PM
2 trucks pulls up, a Caddy, and a BM
First nigga, has the Caddy, he was a lookout
Second on the passenger side, he pulls a oowop
The kid in the backseat, was smokin on a stog'
Beemer was parked at the rock, ready to roll
11 o'clock, on point, waitin and schemin now
Waitin for Flavor to come out, so we can stick him
Move up the stairs slow, don't look suspicious
Only thing you wanna do is just {?} bitches
Did that weak clown, waitin for {?} time
Once set that ain't shit, {?} slash the tires
Cover your face just in case somebody see us
If somebody move, send they ass straight to...
Nigga what, saw the joker jump the turnstile
Snucked up behind him, yo {?} you're alone now
Grabbed the bag real quick, picked up the cheese
{?} was blowin the horn, here come the D's
Flashbacks, it's all about last doin a bid
Violators paroled from some asshole's crib
That was then, this is now, this is a different story
That's right black, cold slapped the employer
Gagged his mouth, tied his hands, he's helpless
Lucky cause we seemed pretty selfish
Cocked the hammer, but they caught the whole jookz on camera
DAMN!!~!!

That 2005 fire right here
They can't front on this
It's that real shit son you know it

Aiyyo, aiyyo the gates of hell, call it a jail cell blizzard
Waitin and hesitatin and waitin for a visit now
The felons is crazy, look at the Timberlands
Your name is John, they'll be callin you Quinton
Seven six, lights out, fights break out
Do you understand what I'm talkin about
Ass be caught in the system, you're hoardin the cigarettes
Givin out nigga threats, givin out bitch threats
You can't escape, you can't face the nightmare
Tell the Joe hell no cause they don't fight fair
Handcuffs, don't make a man tough
They call it justice, but there's just one us - damn!

I didn't even want to say it
They don't want no labels on us
Stay in class, don't get kicked out of class
That's right Flavor boy, back in your face
That's right DeVante they can't front on this
They can't front on this DeVante, they can't front on this right?
Yo they can't front on this, aiyyo
Yo Fido, whassup Fido, they can't front on this?
They can't front on this, that's right
Holla at your boy, holla at your boy, holla at your boy</pre>
