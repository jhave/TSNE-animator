(*talking*)
We good, Thugga
Tell you bout me and my life

[Slim Thug]
All I do is get money, fuck hoes ride clean
Smoke big weed, keep a pint of that lean
Got bad bitches, cashing foreigns off the lot
Your bitch love Thug, cause Thug doing what you not
I live a boss life, five hoes no wife
Keep em swapping out, shaking ass like dice
I see you looking baby, ain't these diamonds looking nice
She say how much it cost, I told her mo' than your life

[Chorus]
I live a boss life, bitch I live a boss life
I been living a boss life, that's right I live a boss life ha

[Slim Thug]
I'm in the club getting fucked up, celebrating while you hating
Your girl in my section, while you home masturbating
I like strip clubs, and strippers that turn up
And like Boston George, I got a mo'fucking plug
Rep H-Town, and I do this shit the best
Stay talking shit, but I bag it with them chicks
Clean like a drug dealer, I only roll with thug niggaz
Been shining so long, they wanna kill us cause bitch

[Chorus]
I live a boss life, I been living a boss life
You know Thugga live that boss life, bitch I live a boss life ha

[Slim Thug]
And everythang paid out, from the cribs to the cars
And I own my masters, y'all slaves spitting bars
Put plenty niggaz on, took my hood around the world
Still one hunnid, them boys been acting like girls
Been grinding nigga, (g'eah)
That's how I'm still shining nigga, (how ya love that)
You boys just rhyming nigga, (them boys just talking mayn)
I see them bullshit diamonds nigga, haaaa

[Chorus]
Bitch I live a boss life, I'm still living that boss life
I live a boss life, boss in that boss life

[Slim Thug]
I got a yard full of foreign cars, while you boys still leasing
Yeah he rap good, but your money ain't increasing
In my penthouse, letting your bitch see the view
She say I'm getting money, I say that ain't nothing new
I live a boss life, tell your boss come get at me
Cribs coast to coast, good luck trying to catch me
Got a lot of tens, and they job to keep my happy
Treat me like a king, never let a bitch trap me

[Chorus]
I live a boss life, bitch I live a boss life
That's right I live a boss life, till I'm gone I live a boss life bitch</pre>
