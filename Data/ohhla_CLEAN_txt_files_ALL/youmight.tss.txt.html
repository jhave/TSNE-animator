You know it ain't over
I said it back in '82
I'll be a player for life
I'll never say I do
I done tramped bitches
That most niggaz would marry
I like to pimp bitches and
Most niggaz be scary
Get a bad bitch
And you can't say no
You're at the mall buyin shit you can't pay for
Then you wonder why all these hoes wanna switch
Best friend on the under
Fuckin' your bitch.....
Pussy you ain't cared 'bout that when you had her
But now you wonder where she's at
I know your heart broke
But it don't show
'cause all I heard from your mouth
Was "fuck that ho."
But deep down inside I know it hurts a lot
I know you can't go on but it's worse to stop
You daydreamin 'bout your x, tryin to figure what's next
Other females can't compare to her sex
I'm tryin' to picture me, all in love with these hoes
But when I meet 'em, they just wanna lick my balls
You can't tell me shit, fuck that
You're just another fine ass bitch with nut breath
I met you on friday, I fucked you on saturday
I can't hold back bitch I'm still rollin' that way
Carry you across the threshold in my new house?
You better try to stick this big dick in your mouth, bitch</pre>
