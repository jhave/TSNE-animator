[Sheek Louch]
Woo! Aiyyo Hood let's talk to these bitches (BE-OTCH!)
Aiyyo - don't fuck the night up nigga, light up nigga
Kinda tired but my dick gettin right up nigga
Aiyyo shorty whattup ma, you fuckin or what?
Whattup with your crew, they look good - they suckin or what?
Bitch c'mere (c'mere ma) I ain't tryin to be startin
But I'm tryin to bust off 'til your mouth look like kindergarten
Ass up, lips hangin, pussy fartin
Uhh, Sheek nastier than caca
I'm tryin to put my meat up into mami like {?} to Popeye
(How you say that shit?) Sheek be feelin titties like a plastic doctor
(Woo!) I done fucked a couple at times
I done bust all in the face of a perfect dime
I even fell asleep twisted off Cuervo and lime
Woke up, and I was on the child like Shyne
Pancakes, all that, I ain't got love for these bitches
I swear it be rare if I call back
Wake up with 'em, I put dick in 'em
Send 'em for some ice and let the doorknob hit 'em (get out bitch)
Some 'gnac and a dutch, and I swear I forget 'em
I don't pass the haze, I don't know who you sucked
And I don't eat pussy, I don't know who you fucked
(Aiyyo that's that bitch right there?)
(Yo that's her right there yo)

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo yo yo, that's that lil' bitch I was lookin for
I ain't know she live right here on the 5th floor
Tell her come over here, I'ma pull over there
(What up bitch, what up bitch)
Aiyyo, that's that lil' bitch I was lookin for
I ain't know she live right here on the 5th floor
Tell her come over here, I'ma pull over there
(What up bitch, what up bitch)

[J-Hood]
Aiyyo, pass the dutch and pass a nigga some tequila
And I'ma hit that bitch with the strokes of death
I ain't gotta G her (hold that)
Cum better than I spit, I do it cause that's what I'm good at
When I'm beatin it up, they always ask me where the Hood at
Got my pimp game strong, and my dick Kane long
I ain't even gon' lie, ain't no need for that thong
I'm a back shot specialist, believe me I'm nice
But the only thing Hood gon' eat is a slice
I'm tryin to give a bitch the pipe, on top of a Carrera
To be honest with you Louch, I'm tryin to see Ciara
Where the freaks at, I heard they come out at night
But I done scooped plenty broads in the morning and got right
I'm just tellin you what I'm capable of
Boo why don't you deep throat my man meat while I break up this dub
I break backs, break gats, kill tracks and get scrilla
So if you want good dick bitch holla at a nigga

(What up bitch, what up bitch) {*8X*}
BE-OTCH!</pre>
