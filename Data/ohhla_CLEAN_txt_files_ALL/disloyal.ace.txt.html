Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Time is money
And I ain't waste it in on you

[Chorus]
Time is money
And I ain't waste it in on you
My niggas loyal
Can only say that 'bout a few
That's the truth
He was the homie
Until he ratted on the crew
We got a problem
We gotta figure out the truth
Was it you?

Snitchin' niggas get buried
Young niggas be killers
Choppers leavin' my bed
Fuck you with your feelings
Ain't no talking to the police, never turn on my pix
Loyalty for my dogs, nigga MOB
Still gotta wash the people you round
Post them niggas playin' them down
These looking smile with you and talking bout you
Everytime you're not around
Boy that's whole shit to the finest
What the fuck you on em
All my niggas on papers
All about that drama
Wait! Huh, oh you ain't no
How do not trust me nobody you know?
Family close, enemies close, the reason I ride em I creep em to toaster
That's on the law, never you know, it could be police that selling you dope
Someone you nigga they work for the folks
Just letting you know

[Chorus]
Time is money
And I ain't waste it in on you
My niggas loyal
Can only say that 'bout a few
That's the truth
He was the homie
But 'till he ride it on a crew
We got a problem
We gotta figure out the truth
Was it you?

Can now real niggas getting paper?
Ho niggas they in, ride it out for my bro
Now hate the shit that they near me
I murb the fool for my mama, I die today for my daughter
I lose it all right now, I'm a make it back tomorrow
At the same time we go harder, this snitchin nigga keep talking
In the cold room and they take stayin
Boy to my ', some home boys they loyal
In most them bitches they ain't ride us
She don't fuck you and go do another, pulling up in your,.. wait!
Ho you ain't know, I do not trust in nobody you know
Time is money I'm here for the dough
Promise to God ain't no love for them hoes
Get a little money your friends on the foes
These niggas ain't loyal
These niggas ain't loyal
Ain't made from the same...

[Chorus]
Time is money
And I ain't waste it in on you
My niggas loyal
Can only say that 'bout a few
That's the truth
He was the homie
But 'till he ride it on a crew
We got a problem
We gotta figure out the truth
Was it you?

Time is money
These niggas ain't got no...
I heard you snitchin
Where we from we count the...
These niggas say they loyal
No no no no
These niggas say they loyal.

[Chorus]
Time is money
And I ain't waste it in on you
My niggas loyal
Can only say that 'bout a few
That's the truth
He was the homie
But 'till he ride it on a crew
We got a problem
We gotta figure out the truth
Was it you?</pre>
