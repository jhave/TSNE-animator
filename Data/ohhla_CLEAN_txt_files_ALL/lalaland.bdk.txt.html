Don't you know it ain't what you got y'all it's how you use it
Any way you choose it, baby, yes I doos it
Laying it out with swift vocabulary
I hope you hear me, here comes the Brooklyn theory
At your service, got you shook and nervous
Now, what you gonna do when Black Caesar comes to surface
My purpose is making sure you bless me right
So I can climb aboard that money train with Wesley Snipes
Daddy love how I get down ain't no secret
And every night, my backyard is just like the freaknik
What you mean from hot sexy mamas to cool prima donna's
Easy pickings on the chickens got them up in the camp
It's that old tramp, the one who keep your pum pum's damp
I see the honeys in the frontier looking for what you want dear
Yes, there's a lot of game run here.

Chorus
All the playas in the game
Another year
And ain't a damn thing changed
We get together and we do our thing
Repeat

Verse 2
On stage at arenas or a show in the park
I shine so bright my black ass glow in the dark
If you're ready or not, if you're petty or hot
Here comes the reign of Kane about to get in your spot
Your tough talk's monotonous, beware as I be droppin' this
Lyrical apocalypse all through your metropolis
Sexual Chocolate the velvet smooth voice
That be the people's choice and get the girls moist
No time for timid fear, cause there ain't no limits here
Got the world in my hands you ain't even found the hemisphere
It's real scary how rap skills vary bringin' dollar bills near me
Making dough rise like Pillsbury
Now get this it's time we start stepping to our business
I come as living proof so bear witness
Not to contradict myself but see really
I'm untouchable but making sure you people feel me

Chorus


Verse 3
I talk that talk from the gutter my game don't stutter
I can tell you why white milk be making yellow butter
Some cats, they be shifty, some cats they be iffy
So I move swiftly, play the field like Ken Griffey
Because, I be the all mighty, relax like Tai Chi
Making it irie
I flow over tracks when the beats are mean
Girls I go downtown when the streets are clean
Make it happen all my peoples
More chips than Doritos I know we all trying to see those
So I return to give you more again
Because my name dates back until the game's origin
See what the fact is, is you need practice
With girls I just mack this, stick em in just like cactus
Watch me now, baby it's all right
I got bunions on my game from it being too tight

Chorus
