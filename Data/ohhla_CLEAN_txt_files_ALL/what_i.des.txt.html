Song:   What I Might Say
Typed by: zlink@zlinkentertainment.com

I might say what I might say
I might turn away
Word warrior princess
Don't feel like fighting today

Sometimes I wish I could be selfish but
I don't live only for myself
It's something that makes you become selfless
When people tell you how they're affected by the message
There is no anonymity when the light is shining brightly
I cannot hide
The spirit finds me
I cannot hide
The spirit finds me
Broken bones and stitches
Vocal tones and wishes
Invisible scars that cannot be traced to any one incident
My pressure pushes dents into the pavement
Deep pressed, meshed with the caress of the funk
And the fresh, fresh, fresh
Transcending, bending syllables past the breaking point
A dope disciple of the funk
So high that I am the joint
Past the point of turning back
I move ahead from where I'm at
Controversial reversal of the typical status quo
It ain't where I'm from but more where I'm about to go
Rhythm intrinsic absorb the discord
Let it roll right through me
It's the new me
Everytime I speak forever changing
They can't keep up with me
Speak to reach through the blessed flesh
At my peak I greet omnipotent ancestors of the fresh
Seek and teach in remembrance of the rest
Peace beseech all thee to meet me at the crest
The same I am unlike the rest, the rest
Through my lips, my lips
My heart my chest, my chest
My love, I do express, express
This is a gift, a gift beyond comprehension
Humbled I am that it was placed in my hand

I might say what I might say
I might turn away
Word warrior princess
Don't feel like fighting today</pre>
