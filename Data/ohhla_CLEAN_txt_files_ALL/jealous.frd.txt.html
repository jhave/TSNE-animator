[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
These niggas changed, they got jealous on me
Try to rob, I got that felon on me
I can't leave the country cause I'm a felon homie
And I don't trust these niggas, they be tellin' on me
And I don't trust these bitches, they be plottin' on me
Everybody ain't real, you gotta watch homie
Niggas say they real, but they acting funny
These niggas changed and got jealous on me {*echoes*}

[Kendrick Lamar]
I don't trust these niggas, I don't trust these bitches
Drunk right now, so you know I meant it... {"808 Mafia"}

If you know me then you know, nigga, Chi-Town like my second home
I done flew a private jet for some Harold's Chicken straight from Rome
I done bust down on a few thots, Fredo hit me on my phone
"Nigga I can't talk right now {*thong thong thong thong*} got pussy on my tongue"
I got worry on my brain, I been gone all summer
Just to fly back home and found out y'all done killed my little brother
Shit is fucked up on these streets, why the fuck would I think about some rap beef?
Nigga I got bigger fish to fry now, empty out my account and I'll pay for sleep
Where's my bottle? Money change and people change and people come
And people go and act estranged; I'm aggravated cause they hated, confirmation for success
Anticipated, I can taste it, I can chase it, back down with, liquor
I could drown out, my sorrows, but I, ain't a, sorry, ass, nigga
Get up, off your, ass, make yourself a hundred racks
Bitch, get up, off your, ass, throw it back, back, back
Back inside my 'Bach, back in a garage that we can jack
Bitch I love my hood; I'm strapped up, what's good? Heard someone said {"808 Mafia"}

[Chorus]

[Fredo Santana]
Jealous on me...
Jeal-J-Jealous...

Comin' up, gotta watch who you hang with
I'm still with the same niggas I came with
On the block with the same niggas I banged with
If you ain't talkin' money I don't know your language
I come from that very very bottom
Now I'm gettin' money and I'm seein' stardom
My niggas savage, don't start 'em
We up them guns, if it's a fuckin' problem
Money comin' in, don't have money problems
Kicked your bitch out cause she ain't wanna swallow
All these bitches thots, acting like models
Fredo, I'm the king of Chicago
Gotta .30 and I fill it up with hollows
Got bricks and I feel like El Chapo
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit bitch
Since I'm a rich nigga, I need a rich bitch

[Chorus]

[Fredo Santana]
Jealous on me, jealous on me, jeal-jealous
Jealous on me, jealous on me.. jeal-jealous
Jealous on me, jealous on me, jeal-jeal-jealous on me
Jealous on me, jealous on me... {"808 Mafia"}</pre>
