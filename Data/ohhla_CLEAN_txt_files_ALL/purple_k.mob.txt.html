Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
It's so easy to fall in love {*2X*}

[Verse 1]
Purple kisses on your neck, thinking 'bout the day we met
Body dripping sweat, eat that, beat that pussy wet
Purple silhouettes, purple drank and cigarettes
She is my addiction, nigga need a Nicorette
Trill-ass misses, fuck her where a nigga rest
ASAP tat cause that's what a nigga rep
Style fresh to death, show you bitches how to flaunt
And the Yves St. Laurent, or her Isabel Marant
Like when Jay-Z out, tryna take B out
All these magazines try to play me out
All my ex-girls tryna fade me out
By the ending I was finished, so it's crazy how

[Chorus] - 4X

[Verse 2]
Okay wait, now hold up, let me switch that flow up
Call her to come over and you just try to control her
Ever since I growed up, I been got my dough up
Now I'm smoking more blunts and I'm sipping 'til I'm poured up
Tore up from the floor up, tore down from my toes up
Get throwed 'til I throw up, but I'm pimping like I'm 'sposed to
Got the illest chocha, reason why I chose her
Mami is a rider and see me I be that roller
She hate a rap nigga walking with his nose up
She date a rap nigga walking with his toaster
So take your picture, get your close-up
Another fake imitation, just a poser on a poster
I did it again for my culture
Went Tesla roadster, traded it in for a Rover
Just to get a nigga chauffeured
Driver pull over, tipping and picking these hoes up
I'm slipping from feeling this sober
Window is rolled up, this purple kissed on my shoulder
Undress and I sex and I hold her
Caressing her breast with my head on her chest I'm all on her

[Chorus] - 4X</pre>
