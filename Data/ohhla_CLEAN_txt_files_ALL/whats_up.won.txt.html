What up (what up)

Ay yo its time to get professional
Me an MFC is (word up) inseperable
Two or three steps ahead of you
And then im deading you
Mad cuz they picked Big Will instead of you
I got these niggas on the streets with heat
To get rid of you (ay yo) see you in the streets
Im a slap you snuff me and clap you its real and actual
All natural (yo what you know about?)
Sendin niggas over to come and smash you
Or flyin out to LA just to get a tattoo
(Ay yo) I neva sold drugs (nah) or finance dudes (word up)
Or have to bust my gun off when i employ killers
Ay yo tha illest mc out be out in the Lex with sex and stop
By the weed house (ahh yeah) right there )word up)
Powell and Lindon (uhuh) dying for my man now his rhymes neva endin
Just got a new deal cant stop spinnin
(Ay yo) Drama you heard about the beef that i been in
Now we

We smoke spliffs on a daily base
Plus we got money all up in the chase (ay yo)
Modeling women all up in the place
You could still catch a Tim boot up in ya face (uh huh)
Or Moet Hennessey and Alize
Smoking on that abe like the BK way
Ay yo thats whats up yo (come on) thats whats up yo thats whats up

Ay yo it aint no limit
Wills the p master (for real)
Niggas see murder hop in the V faster
Ay yo its shocking see me cruising up the block in
Im pumping new shit by Ruck and Rock in (heltah skeltah)
We so deep from B.K. to Q.U.
Lined up all troopers like Isuzu
Ay you could look at the MFC, tell they gangster
(Ay yo) Know that we carrying and know we anxious
(Yo what you know about?) Will Rock Sean Mag Force
Bullets and Ambulance Niggas getting dragged off
Just meeting it squeezing it her ass off
Spliffs the size of buildings being passed off
Never together you cant say break up (nah)
Im fat you can tell from the space that i take up
This game is all about stacking cake up
Paper these niggas fake like makeup
But Xzibit said if you got it i can get it
Trip to the west and dialed eleven digits
Exquisite now i got weed and a biscuit (uh huh)
Rolie on the wrist shit )word) ride around with this bitch cuz
We

We smoke spliffs on a daily base
Plus we got money all up in the chase
(Ay yo) Modeling women all up in the place
You could still catch a Tim boot up in ya face
Or Moet Hennessey and Alize
Smoking on that sticky green the Cali way
Ay yo thats whats up yo thats whats up yo thats whats up yo thats whats up
