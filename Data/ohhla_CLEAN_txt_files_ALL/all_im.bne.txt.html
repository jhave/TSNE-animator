[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
All I'm hearin on the radio (is the) same thing
And all I'm seein in the videos (is the) same thing
Same old song far from original, gotta main-tain
We just like a breath of fresh air so here we blow
 
[Krayzie Bone]
And feel a cool breeze, prepare for the comin of the new breed
True G's, more than just the regular, little different than ordinary
Whatever you want I got styles, and you know they vary
Sick of hearin the same thing on the radio
Sick of seein the same scene in the video
Everybody wanna be like somebody or look like somebody
You just need to be yo'self - I'ma tell ya
Half these niggaz out here ain't even writin writin
They just sit back watchin, plot ya and try to bite ya, bite ya
They keep eatin my shit up so I guess they like it, like it
Niggaz try to hang with Bone so you hear the same songs
The same songs (the same songs)
 
[Chorus]
 
[Krayzie Bone]
Here we blow, here we blow (blow)
Said this is dedicated to the ones that run they rhymes
Say time after time after time after time
Say, this is dedicated to the ones that run they rhymes
Say time after time after time after time, hey
You try a little bit of this you won't want one of that
You really really want a hit nigga this where it's at
They feel it any way I bring it, can sing it or rap
They try to follow my footsteps but get lost in my tracks
One and only, Thuggish Ruggish, Bone
Others wanna, see us but they, clones
You don't really wanna see me nigga, gone
 
[Chorus]
