Tell it to my nine bitch!

*sample plays in background*
"You're the best thing yet.." --&gt; Anita Baker

D-D-D-Diesel on the beat
Shhhhhut up bitch... let Anita speak!
I think on the remix of this song I'ma get uh, Common and Kanye
Yeah... ok yeah

Anything you can do I could do better
I avoid (??) and I'm still a church setter
Weezy just let em, just let em die
I got all the answers so they call me when why
What where who, you think you fly?
I'm up there too - you fly, I flew
I'm up there too
You know they say two, is better than one, ton
I'm, out there pimpin all the time
So keep your two cents before I give your ass a dime
Pistol on my waist gonna need a funeral and wait
Cause I'ma put that motherfucker dead in your face
R.I.P. I know my history
Run DMC but my girl is only worry bout one DMC
And I'm the shit like I-M-T-H-E-S-H-I-T, haha!

I do this! ..when I want to
Nah really I can't control it
Even if I didn't wanna do it
I would DO IT!! Hahahaha
Yeah..

Ready to battle anyone
I'ma go with God and a bag full of guns
Yeah I'm an animal hear me growl
You against me is like Man Vs. Wild
Me against you is like man versus child
Hehe and I am the man
It's Young Moolah, applaud my team
and we prefer red carpet if the floor's not clean
It's Mister, it's the microphone fiend
And they running with my words like I'm writing on jeans
Yeah, and if the lights could all scream
They'd sing my song, I like to be seen
I deserve to be heard if anything else
So I fear God and the world going deaf
Can you hear me now? Heh
Even the R&amp;B vets tell me I'm the..

Scary!
Don't stop the beat Diesel
Cause I got the heat Diesel
Like diesel, yeah..

Heh I put it down like it's too heavy
But how can I with the world in my hands
Heaven in my plans
I swear I am important like the evidence I'm saying
I'm just trying to make my alphabets as heavy as I can
How do I live, whem I'm as deadly as I am?
I get props and every other extra credit that I can
Cause see, I respect the merit of a fan
No homo but please blow me to Japan
Okay I'm getting hotter I'ma need another fan
I keep going so here I go again
Always trying to be better than I am
Label me the best and in the throne I will stand
Why? Because I'm just a standup guy
Your hands supporting me cause I got your hands high
I'll probably be in the (??) Ja Rule when "I Cry"
You only know me but God knows I try
No x-ray show my insides
and I gotta stay in touch with my pimp side
So, tell your girl I said what's up.. I said hi..
She like that's what's up.. like the sky..
Byrd Gang taking off bitch watch em fly
And paint the sky red like the Crimson Tide
Flow retarded, Special Olympics kind
That gold medal heavy but it fit just fine
So, I just had to spit this rhyme
Spit like I'm trying to tongue kiss this rhyme
Some say greatness gets better with time
So I bought a zillion watches but don't watch mine
You little fucks are so i-ron-ical
Nickel plus fo' is a nine millimeter
No starch but I tote i-ron
All out in the open like I'm in I-ran
Young, champ-i-on, like a lamp I'm on
But um, I could clap and then lights off
Take no nights off but my days the same
And people change but fuck it nothing stays the same
And naw I ain't speaking so don't wave the blame
Lock me up but you could never cave the blame
Gasoline, can you invision if our gaze was flames
No you can not stop my vibe, couple page a game
Dang, a game? Yep, well gimme some baby flames
And if this camera shoots me dead, Lord save my chains
Lord save the rings, I am way too vain hehe
Listen to that Kanye again
I play the game like I made the games
You playing like your trying to get traded mane
And you ain't gotta call me the greatest mane
But I am more of a dog than the greatest dane
You boys acting like ladies mane
Crying like you bout to have babies mane
And you can find me grinding on the days we playin'
And that's because I know the sun'll raise again
And when it do I'ma praise the mane
They say you crazy Wayne, but I just bake em mane
And that's Ms. Baker saying, that I'm the...

Hehe yeah 
So, now I got.. 
I got the, I got the, I got the R&amp;B vets saying I'm the..
Hahahaha... Lil told ya bitch!
Young Moolah baby...</pre>
