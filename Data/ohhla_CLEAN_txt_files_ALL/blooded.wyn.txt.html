[Intro]
Ride 'till I die (just because)
Ride 'till I die (piru)
B's up, bitch I'm me
 
[Chorus]
Young money is the label, let us in the door
Comin in this bitch, all red to the floor
And I'm blooded (Suwhoop) and I'm blooded (Suwhoop)
I got bloods on stage, and bloods at my shows
Fuck wit my bloods, got blood on ya clothes
And I'm blooded (Suwhoop) snd I'm blooded (Suwhoop)
 
[Lil Wayne]
Once again it's on, yea I'm back in the booth
Stayin at the top like a tac in the roof
Still on these souls, like a mac in a suit
Still on my toes, not a crack in my shoe
Rappers talkin bout me, but I don't give a who
These niggas still lyin, I'm the motherfuckin truth
Talk tough, 'till I knock off ya couf
And I own my team, I'm like a malu
They hatin on me, I'm jus tryna be Weezy
Just like Young Jeezy, in the lime Lamborghini
Smoked out my mind baby now I'm seeing 3D
Dope boy fresh, from my fitted to my DC
All red, so these souls know who we be
We be's, bloods we B's
Pop pop flows, ya'll niggas sweet pea
Gettin high on the yacht, call it sea weed
 
[Chorus]
 
[Lil Wayne]
I advance my flow, and they must like that
They like it so much, they say they write that
Barkin at the dog, but I dont bite back
I aint CPR, I aint bringin they life back
Back CPR, bad bitch wanna bite back
Skittles on my wrist, yea nigga the bright pack
I'ma shine, I live with a life
Air force fly, call me a knife jack
Brand new coup, same color in the sky
The dash say 2, yall know I'm gon' try
Cop pull me over, yall know I'm gon' lie
They go up in my trunk, yall know I'm gon' fry
Them niggas throwin salt, all over my fries
So I'ma just walk, all over them guys
Niggas throwin darts, now we hit the bulls eye
Young money bitch, New Orleans Eastside
 
[Chorus]
 
[Lil Wayne]
Been around the world, rep the same thang
Been around the world, it's the same game
B's up b's up, flame game
Blat blat blat blat, bang bang
I told my homie, Streets you can't sleep on life
So he popped an X pill, and didn't sleep all night
I aint worried bout you, I'm jus tryna do me
Last album did 2, I'm jus tryna do 3
I am what every pair of eyes oughta see
Bitches wish they can just call it Art of Me
My mommy use to tell me get a 95
Cash money let it say, nevermind I'm fine
 
[Chorus]
 
[Outro]
Yea ride 'till I die, yea yea ride 'till I die
Piru, to Damu 
Yeahhhh!
Su-whoop!</pre>
