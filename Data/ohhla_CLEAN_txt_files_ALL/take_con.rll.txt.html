Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We party till' the sun lights up the sky

You're right here for me I'm right here for you let's go
I'm taking my time, I'm taking it slow
Helllo
Take control
We got one more chance so let's go to the dance of it
Cause you know it now or never
I'm gonna take control of it
I wanna take control of your mind and your body and soul
Make plans and I can't believe we're still here
See love flying around in the air
I'm yours, baby your mine
We ain't wasting no time
We got that fresh love ting going on
Some say that it's right some say that it's wrong
My lifes unreal but it ain't a dream
This girls got a body like you won't believe
I make the first move now she don't wanna leave
I thinks she likes me
I'll take the lead
One thing leads to the next
It starts off with a little kiss on the neck
Then I wake up with my arm over her chest
Thinking about last night there's never a regret

Close the door
What you waiting for
I can't believe you're here with me
Close your eyes it's just you and I
Get ready to fly
We can party all night till the sun lights up the sky
And when the stars come out I'll be right here by your side
So take control
Don't let it go
Take control
Cause you know it's now or never
I'm a take control of it

I grab you by the hands and roll out
Let's go now
I wanna get to a place where it goes down
Where the party starts but don't hold out
Anything goes
I wanna take you there</pre>
