(Sample)
I know why you're here 
I ain't sayin nothin 

(LL Cool J)
Aiyyo baby I know why you're here 
I know what you're doing
I can see it in your eyes you're up to somethin 
I know what it is, but we're still cool 
And we can socialize, I'm peepin ya baby
I'm holdin back I'm not lettin go
Cause a fool doesn't have a shoulder to cry on 
So, give me a kiss and you service
Whether you like a mister or a miss 

(Chorus  sample in the background)
(LL Cool J)
Aiyyo baby I know you don't love me 
I know why you're here
But I ain't sayin nothin
Aiyyo baby I know you don't love me 
I know why you're here
But I ain't sayin nothin
Aiyyo baby I know you don't love me 
I know why you're here
But I ain't sayin nothin
Aiyyo baby I know you don't love me 
I know why you're here
But I ain't sayin nothin

(LL Cool J)
Baby you're my dear I know why you're here
I know why you came I know what you're thinkin 
I know what you need and that's what I've got 
You think I'm goin crazy no I'm not drinking
I know what you want, I made ya want it 
Take my hand listen to the man
You have a plan don't even risk it 
What do you want  a biscuit?

(Chorus  sample in the background)
(LL Cool J)
Aiyyo baby I know you don't love me

Aiyyo baby I know you don't love me 
I know why you're here
But I ain't sayin nothin
Aiyyo baby I know you don't love me 
I know why you're here

Six minutes, six minutes
Six minutes, six minutes
(I ain't sayin nothin)
Six minutes, six minutes

(LL Cool J)
Honey, I know what you're up to I know how you're livin 
I know where you go when you leave my house
I know what your dreams are but I dream too
Your with a man your not with a mouse 
I see how you stare I see how you smile 
I see right through now act like you knew 
I know all about where you been runnin 
Wipe your feet before you come in 

(Chorus  sample in the background)
(LL Cool J)
Aiyyo baby I know you don't love me 
I know why you're here
But I ain't sayin nothin
Aiyyo baby I know you don't love me 
I know why you're here
But I ain't sayin nothin
Aiyyo baby I know you don't love me 
I know why you're here
But I ain't sayin nothin
Aiyyo baby I know you don't love me 
I know why you're here
But I ain't sayin nothin

(LL Cool J)
Yeah, that's smooth, let's just sit here and relax 
while my man plays the piano for us  
Sip somethin mellow
And it's us while you're here 
But of course I ain't sayin nothin

(LL Cool J)
OK, now that you know I know you know that I know you know 
And that's the move so sit right here
Whisper in my ear caress my chest
And say somethin smooth but don't forget
I'll know what you'll say
Just what I thought I know the routine 
I know the routine just what I thought
I know you tell the truth I know you don't lie
Ssssssshhhhhhh, close your eyes    

(Chorus  sample in the background)
(LL Cool J)
Aiyyo baby I know you don't love me 
I know why you're here
But I ain't sayin nothin

I know why you're here
But I ain't sayin nothin
Aiyyo baby I know you don't love me 
I know why you're here
But I ain't sayin nothin
Aiyyo baby I know you don't love me 
I know why you're here
But I ain't sayin nothin

(LL Cool J)
I won't tell if you won't tell
It's cool with me I know why you're here
