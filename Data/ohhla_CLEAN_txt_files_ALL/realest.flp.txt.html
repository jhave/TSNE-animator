Song:   Realest Rhyming
Typed by: zone2409@aol.com

[Chorus]
Buy the car Buy the house
Pimp the wife Pimp the spouse
Throw the diamonds in her mouth Realest rhyming in the south
Back to back track to track none of yall can get with that
Lil' Flip and Slim Thug always making paper stacks

(Slim Thug)
What I want is what I'm buying thats bottom line I'm getting mine
Bump and pine buy the bimb my fifth recline trunk flying
I hit the strip with E and Flip with the mother ship in the 90 eclipse
Number 1 on the grain I grip got kool-aid left in the drank I sip
My candy drip when I buy a car we dranking when I buy the bar
If I could i'll boxed up cause I feel like running in the double car
Slim Thug is who I are I manaja twas with vcr not only a rapper I'm a
Porno star  in a marble spa in panama 
Needed a break so I bout my boss
Needed a lake so I bout a house
Needed sex so I bout a spouse
Until this day its my biggest loss
Cause I paid the cost to floss big whip me ESG and Lil' Flip
Gone shine behind our lip any mic(microphone) I grip I rip

[Chorus]
Buy the car Buy the house 
Pimp the wife Pimp the spouse
Throw the diamonds in her mouth Realest rhyming in the south
Back to Back Track to Track none of yall can get with that 
Lil' Flip and Sucka free always making paper stack

(Lil' Flip)
In my mouth diamonds glaring 
Wearing nothing but Donna Karen
Riden red turning heads always keep a yellow staring
Buy the house I buy the block
Buy the boat I buy the dock
Sitting sideways at ihop watch the trunk see it go pop
H-town players can't take loss 
Playing football like Randy moss
Sippin codeine will clear my cough
Full time playa just like Big Hawk
Make them say "ugh" like Master P
Do the body like P-A-T
Swang and bang like E.S.G.
G's and ballers like HSE
If I'm chillin with a girl you got to be star
Sippin white cup it got to be the bar
Blue black and red don't touch my car
Screwed up click is who we are
25 lighters like DMD
20 inch rims on GMC
Space age pimping like MJG
Let the world know I'm sucka free
Like botany boys I'm just a "g"
Living the life of luxary
F-l-i-p is who I be 
Hittin the switch scoopy lee
We millionaires and billionaires flying to shows to in rockets
The money you make in a year I got that in my pocket

[Chorus]
Buy the car Buy the house
Pimp the wife Pimp the spouse
Throw the diamonds in her mouth Realest rhyming in the south
Back to back track to track none of yall can get with that
Lil' Flip and sucka free always making paper stacks

(E.S.G.)
Like a teacher make a two plus let her know that I'm gon smash her
Heard how you done James Byrd down up in Jasper
Action prison baby its time to kill 
E.S.G. and Solo thats ten-thousand x(times) a mill(million)
So wuz da deal all you fake snakes rider real
Better guard your grill and keep your steel nigga get killed on the battle 
Field we poppin pill and paying bills make them make steel for the scrill
Then cock my pump back fuck a contract and see if you gone get killed
Sharing his skills on sex appeal how'd it feel get hit with this drill
Catch a pill fucking with the real tell what type of weapon you ain't seal
Cedric Hill I will reveal caught strill from here to Nashville 
Flipping good game gripping with grain 84 glass wheel
I don't want no deal I'm a stay independent 
I don't want no deal i'll make a mill(million) a minute
Hit the mall and spend it get bended with a top spot sparkle
Black hard to ball regardless as I fall through Neman Markus
They nautios and cautios I go to war on it
Tightest rapper from Houston since the face with the scar on it
Those are the dirty bonnetts opponetts bet buried dead 
You should of told that it like its that com back with botany black libray 
Red oh scary fed they see the big head I'm made on the last bundle
On a fubu mu goose puna maroo and glass jungle
Thats for my panther and parrots block full of ice and mascara
3 diamond stud young as thug we ain't worried marriage

[Chorus] 2x
