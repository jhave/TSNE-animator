[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
Wait a minute, lonely girl
They try to warn me
They say you're horny
Eager to give it up

Take a minute, lonely girl
I'll be your daddy
Be what you wanna be
Be sure and give the cheddar to me

[Warren G]
She so sweet, so young
But she so sprung on the fast life
Whilin' out in public, subject thump about the past life
Maybe that's why she don't act right
So quick, so fast to fight
over dick that her mother probably did last night
Despite the dead beat daddy
And daughter don't listen, get her ass beat badly
It's so sad when my sisters get turned out
And we get mad when they ass get burned out
They ain't learned about an asswhoopin' down south
That we used to get over Grandmama's house
Open your mouth get popped right in it
And this without a doubt, it don't stop, she ain't finished
You know the business
Switches don't raise too many fast bitches
Now I'm all up in that ass bitches

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
It's chilly outside I had to grab my meat
Stop and think, lil' mama get your daddy a drink
I know you can't wait to shake and hit the gate on the dank
To hit the roll with these real ones and play or skate
Nate, told you the "Game Don't Wait"
I can't believe you sit at home with the frown on your face
It's so young, it's so cute
It's so us, it's so me, it's so you
It's so we, it's on me, it's on you
It's like the 1 and the 3 with no 2
It just don't sound like it just don't feel good
It just don't sound right, you hardly ever understood
It's the big homie, yep the one and only
No need to be sad and lonely
Just phone me whenever you need a lil' company
You so company especially when you humpin' me
Wait a minute, take a minute, think about it

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
I thought I was through with you
Thought that you'd be long gone
I should have knew that you wouldn't be lonely long
From day one my paper grew with you
How can I get through to you?
I'm a hustla and I want it all

I thought I was through with you
Thought that you'd be long gone
I should have knew that you wouldn't be lonely long
From day one my paper grew with you
How can I get through to you?
I'm a hustla and I want it all
