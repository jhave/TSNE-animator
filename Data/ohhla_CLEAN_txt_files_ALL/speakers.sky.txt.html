[Intro: Illmind]
Another Illmind production!!!

[Verse One: Skyzoo]
Told 'em that as long as I'm still up around the curve
None of 'em would ever remember what droughts were
Flooded where they wasn't you see where the crowd turned?
Runnin with them rags until you get outserved
Them that's served got a lean, she could never forget us
Good enough to play on the right and let her deliver
Shorty push stick like see what this pedal get us
Told me put the bat over her back like the Heavy Hitters
When the trunk get the movin and they runnin up into it
You would swear how I hook 'em I was dealin with a Lucas
If I'm there then It's loopin and I got 'em off influenced 
I'm tryin to run the city for Self like I'm The Union
Wide body in it for delf, but if I'm torn
Them slimmies like Kimmy then blaze it's just the movement
I'm still live out of the deck with a tape fluent
And still bottom by the check when I skate through it
I'm with it like the come up, I tripple out the summer by the numbers
Higher than Andre Iguodala jumper
If that SK special get it blowin off the top
Everything is bananas, Snapple and Coconut Ciroc

[Chorus: Skyzoo] (Background Singers)
And my speakers on blast, speakers on blast
Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast
So my speakers on blast, speakers on blast
Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast
So my speakers on blast, speakers on blast
(Here they come yo, here they come)
Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast
(Here they come yo, here they come)
So my speakers on blast, speakers on blast
(Here they come yo, here they come)
Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast
(Here they come yo, here they come)

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
You losin your mind puttin all them names with mine
I cripple your lines, pandemonium when I rhyme
My truck hittin hard, blunt out the Bentley all the time
Ain't cuffin a broad, lil' mama met me as a don
I puff off the car, flow of the century with mine
You fuck up you starve, go find the energy to climb
Put trust in her, naw, I know she'll never be what's mine
You tough as a frog get out the way and watch me climb
To the pen, with a Chevy, inside's Halle Berry
Pimp rise round the telly, swing eyes from the bezzie
King size, hear my desi', jigglin through my celly
Nigga I'm plain and steady where the bins fell already
Shoulda never let me get back, now it's a wrap
Baby crap like a leather went back, audio crack
White and black bitches in back, Oreo 'llac
Blondie or geek, with shorty no rap, 40 on lap
Keep a drop boom, hit so hard make your speakers pop
Stuntin all afternoon, room like a sneaker shop
Pull up on my old bitch, come off at the reefer spot
Same niggaz wishin me to rap wantin me to stop
Naw, choke smoke from my Ferrar'
Who wan' spar? What's in my coat come by the bar
Purp' jar, neighborhood star, and read it all
Change up tomorrow, lil' niggaz know it's me from far
Cause my...

[Chorus: Skyzoo] (Background Singers) (*Maino)
Speakers on blast, speakers on blast
Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast
So my speakers on blast, speakers on blast
Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast
So my speakers on blast, speakers on blast
(Here they come yo, here they come)
(*It ain't no remix without me on it nigga!!!!)
Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast
(Here they come yo, here they come)
So my speakers on blast, speakers on blast
(Here they come yo, here they come)
(*Yeah!!! Yah Yah!!! Maino!!!!)
Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast
(Here they come yo, here they come)
(*Yah Yah!!! Yeah yeah yeah!!!)

[Verse Three: Maino]
Speakers on blast, 200 on the dash
Fully turnt up, bass knockin through the glass
Dippin through the lanes with my pretty law school chick
I don't hear nuttin, I'm too caught up in the music
Here I come yo, with that coke dro flow
Pull up to the club, hoppin out like, "Waddup doe?"
I'm waddup doe, speakers in my trunk blow
Champagne on deck like front row
Ken Wood bangin in a white Coupe
They feel me in the underground like I'm Skyzoo
So when you see me in the whip movin fast
Windows rolled down and my speakers on blast

[Chorus: Skyzoo] (Background Singers)
Speakers on blast, speakers on blast
Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast
So my speakers on blast, speakers on blast
Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast
So my speakers on blast, speakers on blast
(Here they come yo, here they come)
Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast
(Here they come yo, here they come)
So my speakers on blast, speakers on blast
(Here they come yo, here they come)
Speakers-Speakers on blast, speakers on blast
(Here they come yo, here they come)

[Outro: Background Singers] (Skyzoo)
Here they come yo, here they come (UH! SK!)
Here they come yo, here they come (Lloyd Banks!)
Here they come yo (Maino!) here they come 
Here they come yo (The remix) here they come</pre>
