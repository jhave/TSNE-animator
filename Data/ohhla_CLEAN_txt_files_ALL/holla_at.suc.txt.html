[H.A.W.K.]
Passing by haters, in my brand new Crentley
That's the new Chrysler, the kind with the Hemi
Concealed weapons license, so I'm riding with the semi
And if a nigga try me, the clip I'ma empty
I'm on 22's, so I'm tipping so gently
Like Slim Thug, when he's tipping in a Bentley
I'm pulling all the hoes, like Ashton pulled Demi
It's my time to shine, worked hard for every penny
Still hated by few, and loved by many
Cause when a nigga shine, there's always envy
Always jealousy, always a hater
And there's always a nigga, that's not bout his paper
One of them niggaz, in jail they'll rape ya
But I'm one of them, that'll put shells in your tanker
Plus a nigga aim, is sharp as a razor
If a nigga miss one, then the second one'll break ya
I'm Ali, and you're Joe Frazier
I'll jab you with the right, and let the left hook blaze ya
Two-way pager, Motorola cell phone
And I can get diplomatic, like that boy Jim Jones
Better fire wide set, and I'm sitting in a zone
I'ma pick your ass off, hit a block and I'm gone
Jigga told you, not to throw rocks at the throne
Or you gon get sprayed, like a bottle of cologne
I'm in a truck that's two tone, with two yellow bones
With raging hormones, that wanna get it on
It's the end of this song, so I'ma gon get it on
And fuck these two hoes, then send they ass home
H-A-dub-K the thoedest one, the coldest one so holla at son
H-A-dub-K ain't no dispute, that in the booth the boy's the truth

[Big Pokey]
See I'm a big deal, sleep a nigga like his fifth pill
Clips drop a nigga, like a fifth wheel
My skills pay the bills, dog I gotta get it on
Nigga trying to turn a fifty pack, into fifty zones
Niggaz hustle, but guerillas got it in they bones
Real niggaz set the tone, bitch niggaz let it 'lone
Some of these niggaz raps, ain't matching they resumes
It's all me right now, my nigga just let it play
Screwed Up Click nigga, and we coming from every way
M.O.B. Style, and we coming with heavy yay
All night every day, nigga gotta be about it
All these niggaz sleeping, they can't do nothing but dream about it
Niggaz know I flip my crack, win when I whip my crack
A little on the corner, make it grow like a triple stack
I keep my distance, cause I know how these niggaz act
Niggaz slick hammer clap, when I pull the trigga back
You don't work you don't eat, that's why a nigga fat
In between these concrete curbs, that's where I get it at
Soft niggaz get fucked, with no jimmy hat
Soon they find out we playing this game, y'all give me that
I ain't talking, bout Spondalay
I mean come up off it right now, ondalay mo'fucker

[Hook - 2x]
Y'all talk it how I live it, been there and done did it
Let God be my witness, I'm bout to go get it
Coming for you cats, who was yelling out fuck a nigga
When the K beam buck, yeah you stuck nigga

[Mike D]
Boss Hogg Corleone, that's me
Boss Hogg Corleone, that's me
Miggity-Miggity-Miggity-Mike D
Better than me nigga, try and fight me nigga
I ain't gon even much, say yo name
I ain't trying to give your bitch ass, no fame
But I'ma tell you right now, lil' homie
You fucking with the one and only, Boss Hogg Corleone
Who that talking down, on Mike D
Nigga you must be ready, to fight me
You ain't ready, you just a B-G
Read my credentials nigga, I'm a O.G.
I squash niggaz like you, on the daily
I'm fresh out the bing, watch the streets pay me
Nigga, you run with a crew
Nigga my crew, nigga rolling true
What, you don't really want no drama
Hell naw, with the black Osama
Hollin' Os-alama-legum, when I unload
The shotter, nigga you got a problem

[Hook - 2x]

(*talking*)
Come on, you really want mo'
I don't think so, I'ma come at ya like a hoe
Nigga, you pack that lil' 3-80
I run with a crew of niggaz, ready to spray that
Uh Semi-Automatics nigga, fuck you nigga
When I see ya, you bet not be with that punk shit
Tal'n bout uh, uh man they just call me Mike D too
You know they just call me Corleone
Fuck you nigga, I'm Boss Hogg Corleone Mike D nigga
Screwed Up Click, nigga fuck you</pre>
