[Jazze Pha]
Triiiiiinahhhhh!
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen!
Uh, this is a Jazze Phizzle, produc-shizzle
Oh boy!

[Chorus One: Jazze Pha]
Okay (it's your birthday) alright (it's your birthday)
(Girl you're on fire wanna hit on the first day)
Put a hump in your back and lift your rump
Put a hump in your back and lift your rump
Okay (it's your birthday) alright now (it's your birthday)
(Girl you're on fire wanna hit in the worst way)
Put a hump in your back and lift your rump
Put a hump in your back and lift your rump

[Chorus Two: Jazze Pha]
  {Ring, ding, dong - ding-a-ding-ding-ding-dong}
Ohh!  You can ride if you want to
Get it girl, you can ride if you want to, yeah
  {Ring, ding, dong - ding-a-ding-ding-ding-dong}
Ohh!  You can ride if you want to
Get it girl, you can ride if you want to, yeah

[Trina]
Now can I ride you like a soldier, and do you like your woman's 'sposed ya?
Cause it's my party tonight, I'm tryin to cum befo' it's ovah (shit)
I'm on fire, feel it burnin in my bones
Right in 20 {?} deep and Cali playin my song
It's my birthday, it's my birthday
Why did I come in this club with no panties on in the first place?
But in the worst case scenario
I'm in the middle of the danceflo', holla if you hear me though
Party's on, nigga bring bread
Look what you drivin baby to, you got some mean head
Call me supreme red, but when I fade it call me X-rated
Hump in my back, lift my rump, and then I perculate it

[Chorus One]

[Trina]
Ay listen, game recognizes game in the club
Ladies point him out if you see a lame in the club
Gimme, 50 Crist's and a hundred Moe's
Forget a table bring it to me on the danceflo'
I'm in this motherfucker drinkin 'bout to lose my mind
Me and Oprah made a sandwich out of Ginuwine
Yo, everybody in they birthday suits
We gon' ball 'til we fall and you can ride if you want to
Ain't tryin to hear 'bout what you don't do
So put your pimp cups and shake this booty to the ground
Keep me moanin makin funny sounds
Dirty dancin in the club, it's my birthday, so what?

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]
