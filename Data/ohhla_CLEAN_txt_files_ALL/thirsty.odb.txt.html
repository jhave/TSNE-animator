[Black Keith]
You don't even know me, you can't even see me
Friendly of the daylight, now I'm back, now I'm back again
Don't be scared baby, can't you see I'm thirsty?
Friends of the daylight, let me drink, let me drink, my friend
Don't be scared baby, don't be afraid
Friends of the daylight, and I'm back, and I'm back again

[Chorus: Black Keith]
Never going nowhere, you can't run from me
Day and night baby, can I drink, can I drink again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, can we drink, can we drink, my friend?
Don't be scared, don't be scared, baby
Can't you see I'm thirsty? And I'm back, and I'm back, again

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
What, first things first, man, you can't fight the curse
You can't call the doctor, you can't call the nurse
You got that Louie Loco on the side of your purse
And those tight mint sixties, about to make me burst
I can't think, let me sink into your jugular
Come have a drink, with the thirsty love guzzler
From the darkside, baby, don't be afraid
You can't fight the thirst, nor escape the Blade
I'm been scopin' ya, hopin' you be open to
Take a sip, of the potion cuz it's overdue
It's not your ordinary, it's a special brew
In the heat of the night, I will rescue you

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Blade: Trinity sample]
Allow me a parting gift, to remember this
Sooner, no later, the thirst, always drink

[Outro: Black Keith]
Yeah, yeah, and I'm back, and I'm back again
Live, live.... back again</pre>
