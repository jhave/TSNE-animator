[Chorus- Jennifer Lopez] (2x) 
I've had enough
I'm tired of you treating me so rough
Not coming home and then tryna play tough

(Jennifer Lopez)
What was I to do
Though I had enough I still loved you
Even when you played tough, you still was my boo
When I told you we needed to break up, you refused
Sometimes I felt used
Cause I fell into ya trap when you begged at my shoes
I remember you going to jail cause I was being abused
Either stay or get bailed, wonder which one did you choose

[Chorus] (2x)

(Nelly)  
From you saying damn me, To me hardballin' like Sammy
And winning all these Grammy's, All I wanna do is start a family
Theres no need to worry
So stop saying you'll do all thats neccessary
To get me locked up in the penitentiary
Its Nelly and J-Lo's time to bill
I'm like Samuel L. in a time to kill
Buy that Vokal fo'sho, and cop that NellyVille

[Chorus] (once)

(Jennifer Lopez)
From you coming home late, to you saying our love can wait
And making all these tour dates
Our relationship would only lead to fate
My friends keep telling me to find another date,cause

[Chorus] (2x)</pre>
