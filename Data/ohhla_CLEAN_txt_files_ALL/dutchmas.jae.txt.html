Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
They act like I wanna get fame off dissing niggaz
Like I ain't already got fame off dissing niggaz
That's one thing I do, got if I ain't got shit on niggaz
Youtube me, they watch my battles more than ya singles nigga
Recite some of the most clever shit ever made
And by the way I ain't battle in bout a decade
Yo, don't be mad at me for catching darts
Ya'll niggaz through and let's keep it moving, respect the art
I just wanna smoke and chase kush clouds
And celebrate Obama, no longer stressed bout what Bush allow
I wish I can supply the world with pounds
'Cause dutch masters make the world go round

Check me out

[Verse 2]
Mind over matter until the day that my ashes are scattered
Or til that evening at my casket
It's lower then them green stims that grow out of that brown dirt
That ground work, is what calculates and totals to your town's worth
Where I'm from, girls only care bout that brown purse
Black girl lost but Louis Vuitton made her feel she found earth
I can't just apparent that miss ladder
All I can do is teach my princess better
Nas was right on time with that daughter's record
He came out with it the week I found out what my girl was expecting
Now I'm so geeked I wish I could supply the world with pounds
'Cause dutch masters make the world go round

[Verse 3]
Before my grandmother died she said nothing is promised
So that's my proudest fact
So proud in fact her grandson naming his album that
Shout to Harlem, it's only right that I style in raps
Put gold around my wrists and fingers
Kneel down a smile for snaps
Yea, jailhouse pose
For my soldiers in them jailhouse clothes, salute
Listen to the sentences, I just thinks you could tell I know
What the fuck I'm fuckin talkin bout
From hell I arose
Now it's 10 toes on this cold world that they place the nigga in
But I'm good, I got nigga skin
You say I'm a whack rapper? That's cool
Being a black man on earth, I've been called worse
That's why I wish I could supply the world with pounds
'Cause dutch masters make the world go round

Smoke something bitch
