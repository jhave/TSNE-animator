[Intro/Chorus: Corbett]
I've been down this road befooooore
I'm still, I'm still who you're lookin for, ohhh
I been lookin for a place to hiiiiide
I feel, I feel your eyes
See right through my liiiiiiii-iiiiiiife
Ahhh-ahhhhhhhh...
My life

[Saigon]
Uh-huh
These young artists is strivin, they say it's hard survivin
They only authorizin them rappers that's harmonizin
Tell them to not to worry, music is just modernizin
I beg to differ cause if you look upon the horizon
You see a star is risin and go by the handle Brian
He like a man of iron compared to these dandelions
And what comeback? The underground I been run that
It just suck, I'm so stuck to the street like a run flat
Yo it only take one track to get you back on my nutsack
I'm feelin like "Where the fuck is the love at?"
I might as well make it rain, sleet, snow, hail in this dry spell
I might as well come out of my shell, hell
Cause hip-hop ain't been the same since I left it
And tryin to be positive I guess was the wrong method
Cause you could bring a dick to the pussy but you can't make him F it
Now look what I'm left with - this

[Chorus: Corbett]

[Saigon]
We got a black prez, still a lot of crackheads
My grandmother still can't afford her back meds
KRS already taught us 'bout them black feds
They don't wanna see us live, do we act dead?
Then they wonder why niggaz rockin that red
It's the only sensible lifestyle, the day of a lead{?}
Try and put it in his head
The more Bloods that's on the block the more blood that's gon' shed
Ch-check what he said
He said out here dodgin the mortuary is not outta the ordinary
Our people is so poor that it's scary
Cause when we in a war we ain't worried
Like a young G in the street is how I wanna be buried
Look shorty, you put it wrong, here go a thinkin cap
Now put it on, with that mentality you're as good as gone
Lyin there with the bystanders lookin on
I ain't tryin to cook it calm, I'm tryin to put you on

[Chorus/Outro: Corbett]
I've been down this road befooooore
I'm still, I'm still who you're lookin for, ohhh
I been lookin for a place to hiiiiide
I feel, I feel your eyes
See right through my life</pre>
