(Is it yes?)
March forward if you feel that you're blessed
(Is it no?)
Step back if you don't want to go
I lead the way, follow me and I promise you will live forever
All soldiers of fortune, down payment might be death
Our blood it is costing

I lead by example in this war with my sword
So if our blood is shed it's mine before yours
But if there's blood shed I'm the first one to spill it
The battlefield's a graveyard and God's gonna fill it
Keep your eye on the prize, we rise up for glory
Those who survive go back tell the story
If I fall in battle, please tell mine for me
And let them all know you were last one who saw me
Let the people know that I died like a leader
I lived the same way so everything is even
If it cost me my life then I spent it on freedom

(Is it yes?)
March forward if you feel that you're blessed
(Is it no?)
Retreat if you don't want to go
I lead the way, follow me and you will live forever
All soldiers of fortune, down payment might be death
Our blood it is costing

(Is it yes?)
March forward if you feel that you're blessed
(Is it no?)
Step back if you don't want to go
I lead the way, follow me and you will live forever
All soldiers of fortune, down payment might be death
Our blood it is costing
So kill with stronger will, send enemies the bill

On the road to riches speed bumps are worth a mil
Potholes and ditches might get soldiers killed
Roadblocks, obstacles, get hard to steer
Optical illusions of gold ain't real
Prayer for the roadkill, they got a raw deal
Slayed on the battlefield, slow swinging steel
Chest wide open, so fate now sealed
Scars and memories, awkwardly they heal
We take their territory, make 'em all hail
Shake 'em from their cloud in Heaven, give 'em all Hell
Break 'em off a little something, crush 'em all whole

(Is it yes?)
March forward if you feel that you're blessed
(Is it no?)
Step back if you don't want to go
I lead the way, follow me and you will live forever
All soldiers of fortune, down payment might be death
Our blood it is costing

(Is it yes?)
March forward if you feel that you're blessed
(Is it no?)
Step back if you don't want to go
I lead the way, follow me and you will live forever
All soldiers of fortune, down payment might be death
Our blood it is costing
In the game of war both sides will suffer losses

Chariots will be seized, stolen will be horses
Burn down houses, men killed in front of spouses
Many die crucified but there were no crosses
Spilling blood and guts make soldiers nauseous
Always keep composure, when in doubt be cautious
Followed instructions won't face destruction
Faith in our creator, that's our protection
March to victory, forward is direction
Maintain campaign, murderous selection
In the valley of death so many now are resting
History will be made, so I ask you a question


(Is it yes?)
March forward if you feel that you're blessed
(Is it no?)
Step back if you don't want to go
I lead the way, follow me and you will live forever
All soldiers of fortune, down payment might be death
Our blood it is costing

(Is it yes?)
March forward if you feel that you're blessed
(Is it no?)
Step back if you don't want to go</pre>
