(J.D.) Lets rock and roll baby
(Cam'Ron) Killa Cam
(J.D.) Yea
(Cam'Ron) So So Def
(J.D.) Y'all know
(Cam'Ron) Untertainment
(J.D.) Y'all know
(Cam'Ron) I'm here now
(J.D.) Come on

Ey yo you wonder who I are
I guzzle up at the bar
But you see me in the car that start with the double R
Range Rover, Rolls Royce even got a Rocky Rolly
See more ice than a hockey goalie
Baby eating guacamolie
I did without
Now I live it out
Cars got to whip it out
Every year I get it out
Why I be long gone
Where maybe Hong Kong
Girls with their thong on
I'm playing Don Juan
Drinking Char Don
Where the trauma
You smoke weed what you think girl uh huh
Start the car up
Take her on a long ride
Yo she think my steering wheel on the wrong side
No I'm sorry
This is the Ferrari
Lemon like Bacardi
Rock with safari
But la de la de 
We like to party
And every night believe we going to leave with somebody

CHORUS
We be rockin' and rollin'
Now we rollin' and smokin' 
On the phone and we chokin'
While you strollin' and hopin'
For the tone which you spoke in
And I know that you're open
Pour some Branson lie and a brand new five
Hot man, God damn, Killa Cam we be live

Ey yo come on girlfriend I ain't no act of willy
So when you around here don't be acting silly
Ask her did he
Come on I got teh baddest biddies
Ass is pretty
Like hoes down in Magic City
Now you smoke hoes and the coco
Niggas say I'm loco
Cause I'm low low from the puffo
Every night I stroke hoes
No no for homos
F doing promos
I was Def already I just added to So So
Wherever we at
Ready to act
Better be strapped
I live the life around me 
Whoever is telling me that
And when it come to the cash
Bet I'm heavy with that
If your man want to bet
Bet he be cracked
And your little girlfriend
She was wet off the bat
&gt;From the Chevy tonight
Yo i'll bet she be back
For the one night stand
Yea the sex in the sack
Yo I ask her if she miss it
Then I tell her to kiss it
Come on

CHORUS

Ey yo your girl around me thats like sand to a beach
Or a gram to a K 
Or a branch to a tree
Your money
Thats my advance to cheat
And you'll see me and Lance to the V
Yea acting wild
Jimmy back me child
How long you think an ounce gonna last me now
But I love when hoes call me 
The cats meow
Cause I run up in them and I make their cat meow
Are you hip to the dive
How we get to teh thighs
Half of my game yo that shit be a lie
But it's true about Duke from the hoop to the five
And I'm right behind him in a coup that we drive
Baby am i slick
Oh your friends are sick
To see me and my chicks in DKNY kicks
And my clique 
We get the dank and bounce
And put another half a mil in my bank account

CHORUS

(J.D.) Untertainment
So So Def
Collabo
You know
Yea</pre>
