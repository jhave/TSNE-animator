[Silkk the Shocker]
Some shit jumpped off about 12 o'clock
I was like
Post on the block
Open up shop
Try to get away from the cops
To get some rocks
Some nig came through in a cutlass
Mugging this
Throwing up signs and riding slow
Fuck this
I'ma leave that nigga stanking
What the fuck could he be thinking
I'ma leave them eyes closed before he blinking
187 thats what I be after
Chop em up and halfs like fractions
Nigga master murderer
Killing niggas all if I gots ta
Breaks them off propa
With choppas
And popsta
First nigga I see that resemble the driver of that cutlass
I'ma come with a gat
Hit em in the back
And be like what bitch
Hits em where it hurts
Kick up more dust than dirt
Nigga fuck its on when I catch em
It's time to ride
Bust em
Fuck em

[Chorus]
It's time to ride
Who's gonna ride
