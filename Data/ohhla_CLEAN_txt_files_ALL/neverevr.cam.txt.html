[Verse 1:]
Yo I, Drive on the Parkway, Park in the drive way
I had a hard day, I'm on my parkay
I said I thought a brother nothing like Park Aye
No I'm not rico, but I'm definitely suave

Aye, so parlay, I'll let the pigeons know
I fuck em top speed, not need pigeon toed
I leave em bow legged, tell her relax dear
Louie buggin, louie luggage, I'm leaving don't ask where

I had the 2011 things last year
Side colleges, gynecologist, here's a pap smear
Is that clear, I'm feeling bad as ever
Honey LV purse, eww Patten leather 

I'll have her like hmmm..., she make me say mahhhh...
I'll have her like ooohhhh...Then I make her say ahhh...
Never mind the phony, you looking kinda lonely
I want to be ginuwine, can I grind that pony

[Chorus]
Ya'll never ever ever ever could live my life 
(life girl, live my life, life)
Ya'll never ever ever ever could live my life
(life girl, live my life, life)

[Verse 2:]
Yo I, play with a rough stay, I sold enough ye'
I'll never stop eating man, this game is like a buffet
I must say, I get the dust moved
Cock blocks, chopped rocs, yeah call it crush groves 

You wouldn't do diddly digga, my delivery 
is better than a mail man, you never seen misery
seriously, on the other hand visibly
you might know my neighbor walt, walt who disseney

yeah disseney, coke cakes, pot pies 
no chicken in it cuco pollo be on fa-fire
old ladies gyza, they get up early doggie
you see what happen to daddies boy

yeah you was trying to cake it,  you got your mom's evicted
now everybody looking at you, know that's a got damn shame
They made at you, cuz you went and took the drama route
Llama out, and  you had the work up in your mama's house

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Yo I, I hit the dealer,  then the dealer hit the stoope
Then I hit the dealer, leave the dealer with a coupe
Pick up mami, she said "you wanna hear the truth"
This car is hot cam, but where's the roof

I said ma, theres no top, I do this
She said "oh you like easy-e, roofless"
I said true this, four rings, who this
Smooth rick, tooth chip, a nigga need a few bricks

Drop Shawty off, so I can show em some
He cop four, so you know I had to throw her one
Cuz my teammate green off the payroll
We turned yayo, to fettuccini alfredo

[Chorus]</pre>
