[Laughing]

[Chorus: x4]
I'm so muddy
Your so muddy
We're so muddy
Let's get muddy

I swing a hatchet like a warrior
Told you all the dirty history my life obserrved
Show'd you how to keep it rollin while you actin a fool
and now you wanna get all muddy cause you underground too
Don't be blinded by those mainstream raps
Eagle eyeing all your dollars but won't give you a dap I've seen them come I've seen them go
People get so emotional
Especially when you don't let them know
You see the love they show
All I know is that I pay mad dues
So respect what you getting
Cause I do it for you
And if you feeling how I'm feeling
Then I'm doing it right
So let's get muddy underground for the rest of our life's'

[Chorus x6]

There is no history known not to have a trace of dirt on it
From history books, to scriptures, to missing literature
Inner self or outer selves we're all dusty in some way, shape or form
It's like a survival kit we rub on to keep unnoticed
Some spread it on thin while others pack it on like it's the fountain of youth</pre>
