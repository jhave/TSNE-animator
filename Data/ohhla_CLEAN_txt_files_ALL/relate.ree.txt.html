[Intro: Lil Reese]
Fake nigga, fuck your conversation!
Bang! Bitch!
3 hunna!

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
These niggaz, they not real
So how could I relate? (Nah!)
These lames not makin' change
So how could I relate? (At all!)
That nigga ain't puttin' on
So how could I relate? (Nah!)
And I could tell you fake
Nigga, fuck your conversation!
[Repeat chorus]

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
And I'm steady rolling up
Swishers steady face 'em
Got a lawyer on deck for some extra cases
Kush grow when I blow it
Man, that shit be wreck
Kush grow when I blow it
Man, that shit be sick
Killers on deck
Dreaded up looking like Jamaicans
3 hunna shit man
If you the brick man, then we need that make
All that money, watch me sprint
Yeah it's fuck them haters
Free my nigga Kapo
Boy, he will take your paper
Whole team full of savages
It's even greater
Up in my own lane
Fuck your lane, I gotta get that paper
And if I go down, I'mma come up by hitting that cake
These niggaz bitches man, so we ain't related.

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
These niggaz, they not real
So how could I relate? (Nah!)
These lames not makin' change
So how could I relate? (At all!)
That nigga ain't puttin' on
So how could I relate? (Nah!)
And I could tell you fake
Nigga, fuck your conversation!
[Repeat chorus]

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
When their bitches callin' me
Yeah, that's conversatin'
When their bitches callin' me
We might have conversations
And we ain't really with the talkin'
Save that conversation
Got niggaz playin' like they tough
When they ain't really crazy (Nah!)
Stop actin' like you tough
Boy you ain't really crazy (Nah!)
How they form that move for bitches?
Man, that shit is crazy
We get money, fuck these bitches
Man, we goin' crazy
Me puttin' my trust in that bitch?
You must be crazy (At all!)
On my block, if we ain't got it then we gotta take it
On your block, if you ain't real, then you gotta fake it
So stop actin' like you come from where it get crazy
Man, them niggaz they be frontin'
That shit is crazy (At all!)

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
These niggaz, they not real
So how could I relate? (Nah!)
These lames not makin' change
So how could I relate? (At all!)
That nigga ain't puttin' on
So how could I relate? (Nah!)
And I could tell you fake
Nigga, fuck your conversation!
[Repeat chorus]

Nigga, fuck your conversation! [x4]</pre>
