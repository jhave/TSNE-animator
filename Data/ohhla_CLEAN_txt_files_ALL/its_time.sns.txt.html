[Chorus] - Female voice (Dakari)
Baby what the deal (yes sir, yes sir *echo*)
Time to keep it real
It's 12 o'clock (uh), dance floor's hot
Ready to sweat 'til the sunlight comes up (it's Smilez baby *echo*)

Baby what the deal
Time to keep it real
It's 12 o'clock (goin' out, goin' out), dance floor's hot (goin' out, goin' out)
Ready to sweat 'til the sunlight come up

[Smilez - talkin' over chorus]
Uh huh, what the deal ma?
Uh, uh, yo, yo

Catch me in the club (uh), deep in the cut (uh huh)
Polyed it up, coochie, knitted top, desert colored, Wally's is tough
Chumps mad cause chicks is lovin' me up (uh)
Mr. Smilez OGH, that's whats up (that's whats up)
Watchin' all, haters still watchin' me ball (uh)
As I hit the dance floor and seduce them all (uh huh)
Whenever they come, prejudice, not at all
I got big funds, girls "I a mi amor"
Let's go ma, you feelin' me, let's not stall
You wanna get drunk? Game like Henny and Cristal (yeah)
Get you sick, let me see you work them hips
Get you all worked up, is you ready for this?
Let's leave this place, girl you know why you came
Twice my age, but lady I'm twice as paid
We burnin' the floor up, leavin' them broads stuck
My dough chicks see, but don't touch, nigga HUH HUH

[Chorus] - 2X w/ variations
Baby what the deal (what the deal, what the deal)
Time to keep it real
It's 12 o'clock (goin' out), dance floor's hot (goin' out)
Ready to sweat 'til the sunlight come up (it's Smilez baby *echo*)

[Southstar]
Uh, yeah, Southstar's in the spot, the party's gettin' jumpin' (uh huh)
Hit the bar now, and I'm gonna start gettin' drunk and (what, what)
Hit the dance floor, vibe and move my feet
There's some cute hunnies in here, that I'm dyin' to meet
They seen when I pulled up, and skipped this whole line
Right up to VIP, like this club is mine
Just out of Remy's straight up, that's just to unwind
Ready to party all night, until the sun shines
See everyday I'm in a new club, roll up in a new truck
Ride around on new dubs, keep on makin' new bucks
Like what, girl my game is mad rude
If your friend got a man, I'm gonna kick game to you
And I know just after one line, you leavin' with me, right?
Give you such a good time, that's only for one night
And look ma, keep on the low, please don't tell
Want my number? na, I don't want you callin' my cell

[Chorus] w/ variations

[Southstar]
Uh, uh, yo help me out on this one
Yo, yo, can I kick it (YES YOU CAN)
Cats now leavin' the club in the caravan
With about 12 chicks in the caravan (that's right)
So funny, you performed, now I'm leavin' with yo fans
You can catch Southstar, leavin' in a Benzo
With my name on the plate, so it's not a rental
20 inch rims, X Box, T's in the dash (nice, nice)
Best believe tonight, that I'm gettin' some ass (ass)

[Smilez]
Yo, and I'm out before the car close out
With some dirty south chick, that can put more than 2 dicks in her mouth

[Southstar]
And I'm out with the New York mami
Just met her tonight, damn, she already callin' me papi

[Smilez]
And I got a rash down on her knees, you can believe
That the man with the shit is S M I L E Z
Wastin' my time ma, you know the deal
You ain't gettin' no dough, I'm just keepin' it real

[Chorus] - 4X w/ variations from Dakari

[Dakari] - (starts in chorus &amp; solo until fade)
Goin' out, goin' out (repeat, until end)</pre>
