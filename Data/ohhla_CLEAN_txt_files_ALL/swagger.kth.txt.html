[CHORUS]
Gimme Gimme watch ya got
Full blast all night
Cause I got my swagger back, say what
I got my swager back, OK
You better get your swagger back

[VERSE 1]
Come and get it good and plenty
We come to get every penny
Short and tall freak em all
Fatty patty skinny minny
Oky doky niggaz envy
Cause they know they bitches feel me
Blacky whitey darky lighty
Put your lights out nighty nighty
I gotta open door kicking ass policy
Y'all niggaz really kill me silly
Put you out your misery
See listen me listen we
Pack that artillery
Niggaz get out a line
Roast them rotisserie
So shoot fly don't bother me
Y'all bitch ass niggaz ain't shit to me
You crazy leave you swazy baby
Blast through your artery
All the ladies be like
(Damn Murray why you want it like that)
Cause trick I got my swagger back

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 2]
I know you love it
So you peep it
How we freak it
So indecent how we stack dough
And keep it always buy it
Never lease it
Yo look at shorty looking decent
Take it beat it never eat it
Then tell that bitch bitch beat it
My team can't be defeated
With them things you will be greeted
Catch you coming out the precinct
Now niggaz want to peace it
But too late I release it
in your face I decease it
Full of grace when I speak it
Niggaz be like damn Murray
Why you want it like that
Cause black I got my swagger back

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 3]
We give you something you can feel
Think I won't when I will
You ain't street you ain't real
You ain't Keith you ain't ill
Lick shots in your grill
Fuck cops blood spill
I'm from the gutter in the vill
Make a nigga lye still
In the pine box when I pop that blue steel
Fresh out of jail got a new deal
Few mill cheat lie rob still
Give you bitches all a thrill
I'm chilly chill for really real
Cop the illy on a hill
Fam a lam roll a Phil
Let's all get ill
Cause I got my swagger back

[CHORUS 2X]

Throw your elbows back
Twist your waist round
Throw your knees up
Get your swagger back</pre>
