[Intro - Pharrell Williams]
Shake it up.. shake it up girl
Shake it up.. bass
Hey! Shake it up.. shake it up

[Verse - Pharrell Williams] (Shae)
She makes me think of lightning in skies
(Her name) She's sexy!!
How else is - God supposed to write?
(Her name) She's sexy!!
Move, she wants to move
But you're hogging her, you're guarding her
She wants to move (she wants to move)
She wants to move (she wants to move)
But you're hogging her, you're guarding her (damn!)

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams] (Shae)
Mister! Look at your girl, she loves it!
(Look at her) I can see it in her eyes
She (come here babe) hopes this lasts forever, Hey!!

[Verse - Pharrell Williams] (Shae)
Her off beat dance makes me fantasize
(Her curves) She's sexy!!
Her ass is a spaceship I want to ride {*sound effect*}
(Her ass) She's sexy!!
Move, she wants to move
But you're hogging her, and guarding her
She wants to move (she wants to move)
She wants to move (she wants to move)
But you're hogging her, you're guarding her (beat it!!)

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams] (Shae)
Mister! Look at your girl, she loves it!
(I know you love it girl) I can see it in her eyes
She - hopes this lasts forever (hey) Hey!!

[Interlude/Bridge - Pharrell Williams] (Shae)
Ehh, this is your part girl
Uh, this is your part girl!!
(Move, she wants to move) c'mon!
OWW! (Move, she wants to move) ehh
Man (and move, she wants to move)
(Move, she wants to move)
But you're hogging her, you're guarding her
BEAT IT!!

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams] (Shae)
Mister! Look at your girl (damn) she loves it!
(She loves) I can see it in her eyes
She - hopes this lasts forever, Hey!! c'mon
Mister! Look at your girl (look at your girl) she loves it!
(She wants it) I can see it in her eyes
She - hopes this lasts forever, Hey!!

[Outro - Pharrell Williams] (Shae)
Somebody get us some water in here!

(Yo why you, why you, why you wit that fool?)
