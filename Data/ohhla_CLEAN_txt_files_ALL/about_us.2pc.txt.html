[Intro]
Y'all ain't never just tripped and pictured
Just looked at the whole situation
Cause once you look at it
You know (You really do)
They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us

[Chorus]
If I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

[Verse One, 2Pac]
Some say niggaz is hardheaded cause we love to trick
Equipped with game so we bang with this thuggish shit
I see ya try to hide hoping that nobody don't notice
You must always remember your still a member of the hopeless
See you're black like me
So you snap like me
When these devils try to plot
Trap our young black seeds, look it
Coppers as crooked as the niggaz they chasing
Looking for role models
Our father figures is basin'
Some say expect illuminati
Take my body to sleep
Niggaz at the party with they shotties just as rowdy as me
Before I flee computer chips, I gotta deal with brothers flipping
I don't see no devils bleeding only black blood dripping
We can change, watch ya mouths 'ey
I'm watching niggaz work they lives out, without pay
Whatever it takes to switch places with the bustas on top
I'm busting shots make the world stop
They don't give a fuck about us

[Chorus]
Now if I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
Cause they don't give a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

[Verse Two]
It's the morning after and now all the laughter is gone
Time to reflect on what you did cause they saying you wrong
I'm sure you had your reasons, dog I don't doubt you
See the simple fact of the matters they don't give a fuck about you
Or them five mouths you forced to feed
Not including yourself
All you want is wealth, they perceive it as greed
So as you loaded up that mac you continue to bust
The mob was on paper thinking they don't give a fuck about us

[2Pac]
I'm seeing it clearer
Hatin' the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior
So why the fuck these devils fear ya?
I'm watching my nation die
Genocide the cause
Expect a bloodbath
The aftermath is y'alls
I told you last album
We need help cause we dying
Give us a chance
Help us advance, cause we trying
Ignored my whole plea
Watching us in disgust
Then they dead when my guns bust
They don't give a fuck about us

[Chorus]
Now if I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

[Verse Three]
Now all the homies got love for me
Down to catch a slug for me
Guarantee to bleed deeply
Now that's love
Shit, nobody else would give a fuck if I'm tow down
From the floor down
6 feet deep bended cut
What the fuck done went wrong
How long will I be mourned
When I'm gone same song
And give a fuck all along
And who am I to blame ?em
Just doing die through the rain
Since they don't give a fuck I don't
Feel what I'm saying

Now thug niggaz die but multiply in doubles
Wrapped in plastic
Or closed casket
For our troubles
Present times we busted like bubbles
With the police this nation's beasts sent here to run you
Now look at what this crooked world has come to
I grew up on the other side of perfect
A life of hurting messed a hustle whistle die uncertain
So I stay up until I'm working
I see no reason so I sleep
All these seeds in the season
Why you stuck thinking that they give a fuck

You tell me that my world is in peace
Well nigga you're lying
Cause half of my niggaz long gone
Buried in the dirt just for trying
Sometimes I think my block is dying
And that it's awful
To wake up to another day
Shit aint changed that's awful
I wake up sweating, dreaming, coughing
Seeing me upside down back was head
Twisted while I'm laying in the coffin
The shit comes around so often
So tell me something
Before I take it out on the world
And get the dumping
Nigga I'll be so for bang go through the struggle
I'm doing the same thing you did at my age in as hustling
On the edge of straight busting
What's this you don't give a fuck and you fronting?
I'm a drink my Hennessey
Like it aint nothing

[Chorus/outro, 2Pac]
Now if I choose to ride
Thuggin til the day I die
They don't give a fuck about us
But while we kickin rhymes
Gettin into they childrens minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die
They kick us every time we try
Cause they don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm gettin high
I'm watchin as the world goes by
Cause they don't give a fuck about us
Now if I choose to ride
Thuggin til' the day I die
They don't give a fuck about us
But while we kickin rhymes
Gettin into they childrens minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die
They kick us every time we try
Cause they don't give a fuck about us
But while we gettin high
Watchin as the world goes by
Cause they don't give a fuck about us
Rise (Rise my nation)
Riiiise (Riiiise)
They don't give a fuck about us
Riiise! (Get y'all asses on the right path, nigga)
Rise!
Cause they don't give a fuck about us
Get'cha money, nigga get'cha MONEY!!
(Who the fuck you think "us" is?)</pre>
