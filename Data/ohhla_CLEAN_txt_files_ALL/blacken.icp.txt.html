Filled your head with lead cuz I want you dead... 
Girlie girlie bitch tou fucking freaky bitch 
I knowing what you think, you think your shit don't stink
Take you out to dine and dine and wine and dine 
I tell you you look fine, then we fuck till I break your spine 
Bitchy bitchy hoe, we fucking on the floor 
We fucking in the bed then I'll shoot you in your head 
You never make me cry, before that bitch you die 
Wicked clown sadistic Sadistic psycholistic 
I do like Nate the Mack and club ya in the back 
I'm not like other guys I'm quick to blacken your eyes 
Tommy son take off your coat I'll make you feel at home 
Then take out my billy club and go upside your dome 
Bitchy bitchy hoe, you fucking freaky hoe 
You have a can of mace I'll shoot you in your face 
I grab you by the neck and rip that shit out 
Don't think that I'd hit ya but I'd punch and stomp and kick ya 
You wouldn't hit a lad, what bitch! What hoe! 
BITCH!!! You told me that you loved me I thought that shit was true 
But then you sucked on my boy's dick until his balls turned blue 
Freaky freaky trick, take your fucking pick, suck or fuck or what?
Nasty nasty slut I guess love is the word 
You act like you ain't heard 
I'm not like other guys I'm quick to blacken your eyes 
Bitchy bitchy hoe, you fucking freaky hoe
I heard you gotta neck 
Why, uh, why don't you let me, uh 
Why don't you uh why don't you let me break it, bitch?
I think I hurt a hoe a helpless drunken hoe 
Someone tell me so do I hear a hoe? 
Bitch, get in the car then I'll take you to the bar 
But I took her to the alley, and kicked her with the balley 
Stomped her in her face, her chicky chicky face 
You took my heart and bit it so I took your lip and split it 
You took my life and crushed it I took your head and bust it 
I take your leg and break it I take your life and take it 
And bitch it's no surprise I'm not like other guys 
Take it, take it, take it cut off your head and bake it 
And bitch it's no surprise I'm quick to blacken your eyes 
Tommy son take off your coat I'll make you feel at home 
Take that razor to your throat, I'm from the ghetto zone 
Bitchy bitchy hoe, tou fucking freaky hoe...</pre>
