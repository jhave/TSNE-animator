[Intro]
Yea
Jealous niggaz and bitches
Yea
This for y'all
Uh uh

[Verse 1]
So many of us, envy us
Enough to just make a fly bitch bust with disgust
No homo, sick of how they pick me playin this chick
And clam I copped my phat shit from playin a trick
And my outside appearance gotta stay straight
The first opportunity to seal my fate
Even well off they say I feel off
If they catch me rockless
Automatically assume I'm stopless
Bounty's on my head for info
Gossipers turn philosophers lie
My whole life is so strife
So I write to escape my memories
I got a sudden right to escape my enemies
Without rap I'd probably be a talk show guest
Topics on my boyfriends and choppin less
I guess my life interreges for haters when it's fucked up
Copped a Navigator then what?  Guess I suck nuts
My luck up, I'm stuck up
When I'm down they feedin off a bitch
Parasitin, so I'm writin this song for them
Light skin Type Slim
Think I had shit easy?
So you wanna talk greasy?
Please be judgmental after the facts
Yall pouters get to live my life on this track
This goes out to all y'all jealous niggaz and bitches
FUCK Y'ALL!

[Chorus]
They dream they have all the things I did
So I drop these words inspired by Big
Only love those who love you too
Only trust those who trust you too
Only hate those who hate you too
And never ever ever be a fool
And never ever ever be a fool
And never ever ever be a fool

[Verse 2]
At 15 received ass kickins from niggaz
At 18 cats was ass stickin my niggaz
I figure I never had a chance for peace
22 mom of two so the stress increased
At 24 four people I love diseased
In less then a year my life sweet from were?
Fear my tears
Cause they'll say its a break down
I take down the pain with Hennesy
But enemies shoot it up they veins high
Make lives tumors in other brains
I remain Tiffany Lane
No doubt tryna sort out
Fake friends fake men's
Stressed to fuck
They curious bout Notorious?
"Glorious Day" like Springstein
When I bring dreams alive
Hatin can survive success
It turns to envy
And men be worse then bitches
Mad when I surpass their riches
But I hustle like niggaz do
Cold nights to own Nikes and Polo
But to own rights and hold mic's for Dolo
I know hoes who suck dicks
And niggaz alike
Just to say that they got me high
But despite all y'all and for y'all cause I ball y'all
I never fall y'all I still fight all y'all
Yall got balls after you hear this to ever talk slick
Knowin half y'all jealous hoes go slit y'all wrists

[Chorus 3x's (fade)]</pre>
