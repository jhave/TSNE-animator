Yo, come on, come on, Bubba let's go
Yo, come on, Bubba let's go
Uh, frickity, Bubba let's go
Bubba, B-Bubba, B-Bubba, B-Bubba let's go

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Y'all don't know, y'all ain't heard, well here it come again
Bring the rain, blow the wind, and roll the thunder in
We gon' live, we gon' die and everythang between
Y'all the fire, country girl, don't say she ain't a queen
Bubba said it, Bubba meant it, and that's just all it is
He's so south, he's so slow, I hope you fall for this
Me and P-D up in Riley, oh that's a true event
Doing all of them thangs you lames do resent
Y'all ain't foolin' with this (oh), don't even bother with that (oh)
I'm the hardest of these (oh), like my father for that (whoo)
Talkin' slick indirectly as if you really want it
That old boy don't be snappin', it just sound silly don't it
Run and shine up the coast, it's like the early twenties
What you done the whole day I did in thirty minutes
Boy don't run from me, it won't hurt you at all
Bubba walkin' the walk, y'all just learnin' to crawl

[Timbaland]
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind (I'm a lose it)
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind (I'm a lose it)

[Bubba Sparxxx]
They still here, I be damned if they be losing patience
Get yo ass off my porch or else the blues await ya
No more deer, no more geese, we huntin' close minded
Some bitches want some bidness well you can sure find it
The new south is alive and well inside of Bubba
Made his soul hurt in him, don't seem to mind each other
Thank you Lord for the blessings that you bestowed upon
This old boy from down there, I bought a golden pond
See they wanted to hate it, but they learnin' to love it
Timmy check on that fire, don't let it burn in the oven
Drankin' liquor, thankin' quicker that mostly y'all imagine
After this, where's yo crib, I just might call a cabin
On the lake, next to mama, my sister Ginge and them
Have 'em sayin' Timmy's cracker, yeah we remember him
Come on Betty make it jump I make ya work it wild
Slurp it up, swallow somethin', you get a perfect smile

[Timbaland]
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind (I'm a lose it)
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind (I'm a lose it)

[Bubba Sparxxx]
But I'm here for the long haul y'all
But that just ain't a fact, naw, naw
Them old boys made her take it all off
You ain't got enough heart, naw, naw
Lose your mind, find your spirit and let your life begin
Say they just drank and smoke, well is you mice or man
We them folks takin' three when y'all was takin' one
Still I don't go to war totin' the naked gun
Please pardon me people, I'm still finding myself
Put on it's been a while, and rewind it to def
Listen closely when I babble cause I done stand the demon
In his eyes, and his smile like I was glad to leave him

[Timbaland]
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind (I'm a lose it)
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind (I'm a lose it)

[Timbaland]
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind (I'm a lose it)
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind
Now lose your mind, lose your mind (I'm a lose it)</pre>
