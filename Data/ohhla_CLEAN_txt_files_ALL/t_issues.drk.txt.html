Typed by: AZ Lyrics

(Uh) Aww yeh, aww yeh
Call up I'm drinking...let's
Let's call up um (Uh)

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older somebody should've told ya

I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
A strong one

Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit

'Cause I'm on one
Fuck it I'm on one
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

You know what I like, oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, Oh yeah
Oh yes, Oh yeah

You know what I'm sipping, I teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slippin' and put in something different
So you're the only one
'Cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one

Oh Oh, trust issues
Oh Oh, trust issues
Oh Oh, trust issues
Oh Oh oh ooh

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Let's call up I'm drinking, let's all get wasted
I'm drinkin', let's all get faded

Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfucking north side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sittin' court side
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You actin' like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show
I can tell, I can tell, I can tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess they don't really make 'em like me no more
Uh, you can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if ya what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in
And tell 'em all leave their cell phones on the table where we see 'em
I'm all day with it man, AM to the PM
Niggas hatin', I just wish they would say it when I see em all

That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been gettin' lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women wanna fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things that I think I can find in you, in you

Oh Oh, trust issues
Oh Oh, trust issues
Oh Oh, trust issues
Oh Oh oh oh

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Let's call up I'm drinking, let's all get wasted
I'm drinkin', let's all get faded
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Call up on drinking, let's call up</pre>
