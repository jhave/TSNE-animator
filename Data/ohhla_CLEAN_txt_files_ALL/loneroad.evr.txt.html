Typed by: tim_timbo_2003@hotmail.com

Too much time thinking about all of my mistakes
My heart, my mind, my soul, my body ache
A hunger for the loving arms of your embrace
I walk along the lonely road

I walk along the lonely road
My back is strong girl, I carry the load
All the grinding time, I pay the debt that's owed
I walk along the lonely road

Too much time thinking about everything that went wrong
I cry my eyes out every time I hear your song
I hope this path brings me back where I belong
I walk along the lonely road

I walk along the lonely road
My back is strong girl, I carry the load
All the grinding time, I pay the debt that's owed
I walk along the lonely road

Too much pride for me to up and take the blame
Deep inside, girl it's killing me with pain
Every night I sleep, I call your name
I walk along the lonely road

I walk along the lonely road
My back is strong girl, I carry the load
All the grinding time, I pay the debt that's owed
I walk along the lonely road

I walk along the lonely road
My back is strong girl, I carry the load
All the grinding time, I pay the debt that's owed
I walk along the lonely road
I walk along the lonely road, I walk along the lonely road</pre>
