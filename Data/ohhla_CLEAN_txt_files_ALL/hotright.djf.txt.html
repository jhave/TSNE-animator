Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Got your hands up cause you think you've got it
Going crazy, we're not even started
Eh oh eh oh eh eh, eh oh eh oh oooh
It's so funny that you think you're winning
Cause somebody told you who was spinning
Eh oh eh oh eh eh, eh oh eh oh eh eh

You know you're only in it
Cuz it's hot right now, hot right now
Turn it up right now
Put your hands in the air if you want it right now
Eh oh eh oh hot right now
You know you're only in it
Cuz it's hot right now, hot right now
Turn it up right now
Put your hands in the air if you want it right now
Eh oh eh oh hot right now

(throw your hands up...)

You got the latest place
It's on your radar
By the time you show your face, it's over
Eh oh eh oh eh eh, eh oh eh oh oooh
You got the magic numbers on your speed dial
And you could barely drop a name, but meanwhile (meanwhile)

You know you're only in it
Cuz it's hot right now, hot right now
Turn it up right now

Put your hands in the air if you want it right now
Eh oh eh oh hot right now
You know you're only in it
Cuz it's hot right now, hot right now
Turn it up right now
Put your hands in the air if you want it right now
Eh oh eh oh hot right now

I'm let me see the club get hotter, hotter
I wanna see your hands up higher higher
I don't need close shouts oh oh oh oh
Can I get a woah!
I'm let me see the club get hotter, hotter
I wanna see your hands up higher higher
I don't need close shouts oh oh oh oh
Can I get a woah!

You know you're only in it
Cuz it's hot right now, hot right now
Turn it up right now
Put your hands in the air if you want it right now
Eh oh eh oh hot right now
You know you're only in it
Cuz it's hot right now, hot right now
Turn it up right now
Put your hands in the air if you want it right now
Eh oh eh oh hot right now

(throw your hands up...)

Cuz it's hot right now....</pre>
