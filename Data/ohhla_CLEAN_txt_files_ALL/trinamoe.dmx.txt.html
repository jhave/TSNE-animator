WHAT!
UHH!
WHAT!
C'MON!

HOOK:
AYO!
Bounce to that Trina Moe
Niggas about to blow
Bouncin straight out the door
Here we go, here we go

[Verse 1]
Bloodline, scratch all day, match all weight
Only dogs eatin is us we snatch all plates
Err, ERR! ERR! Get him boy
Click, click, pop the leash, hit him boy
Niggas brag about waggin, we stop the tails
X drop an album, niggas droppin sales
Niggas can't fuck with the dog, forget about it
Money went up against the dog, read about it
Man listen, you cats better walk easy
I'm on some positive shit but I still walk greasy
aint nothin changed, still aint sweet
stand on one block, but I own the whole street
and on the whole street is dirty niggas wit funny moves
leavin your house with bloody boots, we cruddy dudes
rest of them ass kissers, is sensitive ass niggas
fourth album, and I still get in that ass nigga

HOOK 2X

[Verse 2]
It's Dark and Hell is Hot, Flesh of my Flesh, Blood of my Blood
And Then There Was X
Got niggas like what's next and then
Hit 'em again, you cats aint never gon' win
I was here before most of y'all careers were born
I'll be here when y'all careers are gone, still strong
Difference between right and wrong is me
Niggas talk shit, but you can't MC
we already know how much your watch is worth
talk about, helpin the hurt, savin the church
won't you brag about helpin out where you come from
and give brothers a job that really want one
gotta think about that shit you said, you don't mean it
I done listened to that shit you said, but I done seen it
most of you cats is type funny
but when it comes time to feed the hungry, gon get type ugly

HOOK 2X

[Verse 3]
man I'm already knowin, like y'all niggas is knowin
you can't fuck with dog, bust a cap, scrap or flowin, WHAT!
seein is believin and well, let's just see
I aint even gon' speak, one million the first week
aight, let's ask the streets, how many sold?
WHAT? Three niggas, three months to go gold?
c'mon esse, keep it real holmes
you fuckin with the dog, you already know
this aint nothin new, fuck is you mad at
15 million, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
rest assured, I'm best abroad
you can test Billboard, cuz the, rest are frauds
I got 18 years under my belt, rappin
let me see, you was three, I was, makin it happen
next time we bump heads don't be hard headed
show some motherfuckin respect bitch, or you'll all get it

HOOK 2X</pre>
