[Intro: J. Cole]
Heh! Oh yeah! Yeah! Oh turn me up!
Uh huh! Uh huh!

[Verse One: J. Cole]
Gotta, young chick from the hood, southside, cops never let her outside
Nigga knew the type of shit she was up against, little did he know the shit was 'gon backfire
Then she, act quiet, got baptized, sane and inquired but the things she desired was a...
Older nigga showed her how to be a freak, uh, the young girl is in heat, it's deep
But she sneakin out, often loose, on the streets at night when the freaks is out
Butterfly tat on her back that she tried to hide until her father found her secret out
Now he flippin out, he kicked her out, she livin on her own and it's vicious out
Years go by now I got her in my room and I thinkin of the best way to kick her out
It's cold!

[Chorus: Fabolous]
It's all she ever talk about is louis, louis
All she ever talk about is louis vuitton, and nigga I can't fuck with her no more
Aiyyo! Aiyyo! I said louis, louis, all she ever talk about is louis, louis
All she ever talk about is louis vuitton, and nigga I can't fuck with her no more
Aiyyo! Aiyyo! 

[Verse Two: J. Cole]
I told the bitch somebody stole my rollie, she talk about me too
Huh! I came through with the brand new louis bag, she talk about me too
L.A. on my next flight, you guess right, she sayin me too
Now e'rybody meet ms. me too, god damn be you
And if that is you, you so shallow you on a boat, that won't travel
Won't float, and won't paddle if I go broke, it won't matter 
This stupid ass shit don't make me, I been poor won't break me
You so caught up on material shit,we both knowin what you can't even get

[Chorus: Fabolous]
I mean louis, louis, all she ever talk about is louis, louis
All she ever talk about is louie vuitton, and nigga I can't fuck with her no more
Aiyyo! Aiyyo! I said louis, louis, all she ever talk about is louis, louis
All she ever talk about is louis vuitton, and nigga I can't fuck with her no more
Aiyyo! Aiyyo!

[Verse Three: Fabolous]
She was standin at the baggage claim, first thought gotta bag this dame
Not knowin she was one of them chicks with the baggage name types
Anyway, I'm happy that it came off the belt, now me enjoyin sayin it's the belt
She looked like she came on herself, shorty you should be ashamed of yourself
I'm checkin out her cute face, thin little waist line
She checkin out my suitcase, like the bitch had K9
Could have took her number, but that a be like takin bad advice
When you look at her you lookin at a price as I walked away she said that's so nice

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Louis, louis, all she ever talk about is louis, louis
All she ever talk about is louie vuitton, and nigga I can't fuck with her no more
Aiyyo! Aiyyo! I mean louis, louis, all she ever talk about is louis, louis
All she ever talk about is louis vuitton, and nigga I can't fuck with her no more
Aiyyo! Aiyyo!

[Verse Four: Fabolous]
You know the one that'll order the lobster go for the champagne
Don't care what you do but you better do the damn thing, if you wanna win the campaign
'Cause, her company just ain't cheap, what y'all probably ain't peep
You can't keep a shallow bitch, if your pockets ain't deep
So I tried to be slick and reserve no dinner ain't take her to the club had a meeting at the bar
Let her walk in, view her from a far, gotta let her know can't keep her in the dark
'Cause she'll run her tab up if you let her, and I though I knew better
'Til she say let me start with a double shot, hey! bartender let me get a......

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Louis, louis, all she ever talk about is louis, louis
All she ever talk about is louie vuitton, and nigga I can't fuck with her no more
Aiyyo! Aiyyo! I mean louis, louis, all she ever talk about is louis, louis
All she ever talk about is louis vuitton, and nigga I can't fuck with her no more
Aiyyo! Aiyyo!
