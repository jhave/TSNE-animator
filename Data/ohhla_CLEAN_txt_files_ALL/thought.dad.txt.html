[Intro - Brandy]
Baby ...baby .. baby

[Verse I - Brandy]
Take a good look at me
I done cried from the lies
It hurts so bad inside
If you need a thing 
Ain't never had nothing to me break me down to the floor 
Til' I hide the pain 
Here to show you a compromise of heart for I'm fallin apart
Til there are no remains
What had me thinking your word was your bond
(Don't you know)
That your never gonna love if you knew it was a situation you knew you weren't ready for
I could see if your feelings had changed but damn you just slammed the door
You told me the one you said you would put down your whole life for 
I can comprehaned the deck of cards you dealt me

[Hook - Brandy]
How can you turn on me?
(How can you how can you)
How can you purposely?
(How can you how can you)

[Chorus - Brandy]
Lessoned learned house can burn 
Were close to heat
Bet your words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said 
Thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said 
Thought you said that you need me
Thought you said 
Thought you said you complete me
Thought you said you were never gonna let it go

Thought you said 
Thought you said when you held me
Thought you said 
Thought you said when'd you tell me 
Thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said that your never gonna let it go

[Verse II - Diddy]
The times that you weren't there
The times that you left me here 
The times that I needed you 
You know my love is true
My passions inside for you
The nights that I cried for you 
A man has these feelings too
Same shit that shall go thru' 
I been here before 
Sometimes the pain you ignore
Until it's right at your door 
And then you just can't take it no more
Why does love feel this way?
Why does it hurt so bad

[Hook - Brandy]
How can you turn on me?
(How can you how can you)
How can you purposely?
(How can you how can you)

[Chorus - Brandy]
Lessoned learned house can burn 
Were close to heat
Bet your words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said 
Thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said 
Thought you said that you need me
Thought you said 
Thought you said you complete me
Thought you said you were never gonna let it go

Thought you said 
Thought you said when you held me
Thought you said 
Thought you said when'd you tell me 
Thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said that your never gonna let it go

[Verse 3 - Diddy]
The heartache and pain 
Sometimes it goes to your brain 
Sometimes it makes you insane 
Sometimes our joy is our pain
Cuz it tears you apart 
These affairs of the heart
I think I'm strong but I'm not
And when I look in ya eyes 
You know it kills me inside
But I can't wait for that day 
That you come back to me girl
After we both go away 
It's just to see if it's real
There's no denying the fact
It's meant to be if you let it go 
And then they come back.
If this is our last dance we need to practice our steps,
The situation I left behind but your hearts what I kept, 
You said I did you wrong you did me wrong we was both at fault 
And of course you lost me with your alibis 
And all of your talking 
And most important I just question my self

[Bridge - Brandy]
The pain is taking over I just can't believe
(I need your hand)
What happened then compared to now is dreams
(I need your hand)
And I know now that you'll need me

[Diddy:]
I can't sleep, I can't breathe, 
I ain't eat in days 
Stomach pains from arguing
Didn't you cheat on me that's how the problems started 
And as far as I'm concerned we learned our lesson
Well it's all in the healing and that process has got me stressin' 
I'm so pressured I'm so physically drained 
I ain't thinkin straight 
I loved you more than my own self
Although I couldn't bear the pain of seein my old self 
Young wild uncontroled self
I love you girl 
I don't need no one else

[Chorus - Brandy]
Lessoned learned house can burn 
Were close to heat
Bet your words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said 
Thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said 
Thought you said that you need me
Thought you said 
Thought you said you complete me
Thought you said you were never gonna let it go

Thought you said 
Thought you said when you held me
Thought you said 
Thought you said when'd you tell me 
Thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said that your never gonna let it go

[Outro - Diddy &amp; Brandy]

[Diddy]
When I look in your eyes 
You know it kills me inside

[Brandy]
Didn't you. didn't you...ooohhh

[Brandy]
Lesson learned
House can burn 
We close to heat
Bet your words don't mean nothing to me

[Diddy]
These affairs of the heart 
I think I'm strong but I'm not

[Brandy]
Thought you said thought you said that you love me
Thought you said thought you said that you need me

[Diddy]
Come back to me girl

[Brandy]
How can you how can you
Thought you said thought you said you complete me
Thought you said you were never gonna let it go</pre>
