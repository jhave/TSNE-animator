Song:   All the Same
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's all the same, it's all the same
All you rappers got work
It's all the same, it's all the same
Everybody did dirt
It's all the same, it's all the same
Everybody went work
It's all the same, it's all the same
All these bitches gon talk

If you hit one club you're in through them all
Bought her girlfriend I ran through them all
Open up a brick and still the same cake
All I know you niggaz is saying the same thing

Bitch nigga where the bricks at
Put 'em in the hood so you can flip that
All know what you heard who the fuck ya
I'm supposed to be here you lost cut
When the shit come on it goes silly
You fucking round Mr. put on for my city
Mr. 180 motherfucker broke nigga pound
Fuck this sucker ye nigga get for the town
Used to just bought another how 10 go down
Just to reassure me I gon see no clown
I never ever think I'm too rich for this shit
Got that 40 cal on me 2 clips for this bitch

If you hit one club you're in through them all
Bought her girlfriend I ran through them all
Open up a brick and still the same cake
All I know you niggaz is saying the same thing

It's all the same, it's all the same
All you rappers got work
It's all the same, it's all the same
Everybody did dirt
It's all the same, it's all the same
Everybody went work
It's all the same, it's all the same
All these bitches gon talk

They say the game's the same but the players change
But the players change and the game will change
Ain't nothing changed around me but my chain
My paper, my crib, my fame
Everybody sound the same but us but we don't give a fuck
Man toss that lame a stoozle so he can step it up
Man this offence suck at cool brat, no good luck
You know when they actin fool and when they can't act
My money long like Cher hair I'm everywhere like air
I'm about here with the hot pants where they don't play fair
Got hella nicknames like weed crane
Just spark a spliff and get high do by cranes

It's all the same, it's all the same
All you rappers got work
It's all the same, it's all the same
Everybody did dirt
It's all the same, it's all the same
Everybody went work
It's all the same, it's all the same
All these bitches gon talk

If you hit one club you're in through them all
Bought her girlfriend I ran through them all
Open up a brick and still the same cake
All I know you niggaz is saying the same thing</pre>
