[Drake]
My name is Drizzy.  And I ain't perfect
But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeney
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and I'm the one that feed it
But truly you bad enough that y'all don't really even need it
You can show up at the party on dirty pub-a-lic transit
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snapping candids
Of you and your posse partying, drinking what you get handed
Wit your Virgin Island tans, all looking like you just landed
I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I comprehend it
But these girls are having fun with whoever money they spending
Screaming:

[Chorus: Santigold]
I  got to be unstoppable, I got to be unstoppable
Ey, ey, ey, ey, you don't like. (x2)

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, um
My name is Weezy, I'm almost perfect
And I work harder, than hard working
Bizarre circus
That's when the ball surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I'm laying on my back, I'm never backing down
So overstand me
I got a condo in Miami
And my doormat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana, but I never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta
And I always wear a bandana
And when it comes down to stuntin
You boys is just buntin
And I'm swinging for the fence
You girl hanging from my dick
Your girl singin to my shit, like
A la-la-lollipop
She say I get that pussy wetter than a designer shop
And she say I thick that pussy better, better than her gynecol-low-gist
Hold this, text me on my wiry on some mo' dick
Mo' dick
Old bitch
Young bitch
But I be like, dam, all I got is fun dick

[Chorus: Santigold]

I got the talk, the beat and bass
Gimme one, I take it make you lose your place
Tell me, I-I-I, can't play so I speed up the pace
I break it, break it, you can't stop me
Any-uh-bass

[Chorus]</pre>
