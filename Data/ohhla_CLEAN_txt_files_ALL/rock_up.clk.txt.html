[The Click talking]
Alright, alright
I'm tight, I'm tight
All day, all day

[Hook]
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
If the funk jump then my pistol will pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
Don't let that shit jump, my pistol will pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
If that shit jump then my stapler will pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
Don't let that shit jump, my pistol will pop

[B-Legit]
Straight up on some swirve, like pump I got my shit tight
Mobbin' in the Chevy, four deep after midnight
And just because I'm rappin' nigga ain't shit changed
I'm still slangin' thangs nigga deep in this game
My homies like to fork, them fools like to ride
My homie got the Tommy out the passenger side
About to let em' fly cause it's another season
And niggas let them ho punk bitches be the reason

[E-40]
Niggas on the roof, bulletproofs and straps
Posted on the corner, walkie-talkies and booby traps
Ready for whatever, we can get it on
In any type of weather, ya know we fuck them domes

[B-Legit]
Them choppers will chop, niggas slippin' down ya block
Funkin' out her hand, you wouldn't understand

[E-40]
Half money half heart, ain't nowhere to hide
Put yo shit in park, you know these fools will ride

[B-Legit]
Suicidal if it's vital on these streets of mine
And niggas pack them gats bustin' thirty-two times
Business is fine if ya fuckin' with me
On the spot where a niggas slangs his D

[Hook]
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
If the funk jump then my pistol will pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
Don't let that shit jump, my pistol will pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
If that shit jump then my stapler will pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
And if that shit jump...

[B-Legit]
Testin' one, two a nigga sold a few of those ki's
Broke em' down to boulders, stacked a few of those G's
My bitch was the check, my set was the year

[E-40]
A nigga had hills, meals
And about eleven thousand dollars worth of bills

[B-Legit]
I was posted at the spot smokin' doja
Just put the rumble in my 68 Nova

[E-40]
But what about me

[B-Legit]
Fool you can't get with it

[E-40]
But what about me

[B-Legit]
Fool my crew is Sick Wid It
Boom-shaka-laka, it's the big blocker
Three ninety six, I get rubber and fit punk bitch
And I'm a bomb smokin' zipper holdin' pistol packin'
In my lap cause it's G's that a niggas stackin'
Mackin' is my game, Legit is my name
And if ya ain't careful ho
Ya pockets are drained so
What else ya wanna know about this playa
Dope rhyme sayer, my mail weigh longer than theirs
That shit is gettin' funky and them fools wanna bust caps
But motherfucker ain't no money in that
You need to lose that strap and go from the shoulders
Cause shit gon' get funky with this soldier

[Hook]
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
If the funk jump then my pistol will pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
Don't let that shit jump or my Reuger will pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
If that shit jump then my stapler might pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
Please don't let it funk...

[D-Shot]
First I flipped the Vette, then came the Lex
I swept up thirty thangs to get the whip got me blessed
Eighteen and older, money gets me over
Sixteen years old with two straps on my shoulder
A real Hillside hog, leavin' em' fucked in the fog
Nigga you can't fade me I'm ya top notch dog
How can ya figure that D-Shot will sliver
Nigga run up on me then I gots to split ya

[E-40]
Split ya, no shit and no white for sale
Man I'ma rob that nigga, let the buzzer be the bell
Cause I ain't fixin' to suck up to none
Punk now that not even in my plan
Dry as the fuck and I'm the only one left in the yo-yo
Seven houses down, cross street dashboard, broken down Pinto
Black screens, high school prom queens
Smoked out, shriveled up as dope fiends

[B-Legit]
Heckyls my, Jekylls me sweatin' me
Just like the task, them motherfuckers had my ass
Won't be able to serve niggas for the one forty
Give me thrirty, rock up my birdie

[Hook to fade]
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
And if that shit jump then my pistol will pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
Please don't let it jump...it'll pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
If that funk jump then my pistol will pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
Please don't let it funk my chop-chop will pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
If the funk jump then my brownie might pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot
If the funk jump then my uh...it'll pop
Rock up my birdie on the D-spot</pre>
