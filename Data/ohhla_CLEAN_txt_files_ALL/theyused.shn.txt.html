Song:   They Used To Do It Out in the Park
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

The hip-hop sound went through stages
Embark on a trip as I flip through pages
This particular part 'bout a bridge on the Hudson
I first got hand by the rhymes and the cuts and
If I'm not mistaken makin two records mix
And certain deejays had a few dope tricks
If you asked to be on you would be their guest, y'all
Say a few 'ho's and a 'yes yes y'all'
They had battles of the neighborhood jocks
And I used to take the jam right straight to the box
Every now and then you'd hear gunshots ring
Just duck, what the fuck, yo, it ain't no thing
What I thought was shots was just a few pranksters
Were pow-pow-pow men juicin the gangsters
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark

This was a time MC's used to bug out
Yo, what happened? (Yo, somebody pulled the plug out)
Just about the time when you jumped for joy
(Yo, you take my stage, I'ma kill you, boy)
Answer back and gettin smacked and your friends made jokes
(Hey, pack it up and get out of the park, folks)
But only to the cops we made some committment
I was shocked when the stick-up kids took the equipment
Say - what - is the message?
(Love is the message)
Say - what - is the message?
(Love is the message)
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park

In the winter time they moved the jams to the ????
Do you think that the cold made the whole thing cease?
I recall sein Flash one time - no, two
Can't forget about the Queensbridge Crew
For this is the place which I made my mark
And those who resist or try to dis get sparked
In the park after dark things really got cookin
I seen the titles of idols and many chains get tooken
I seen the scatter of pack, letter for letter
If you wasn't from the town they'd beat you down
But these are just pieces of the ancient ways
But the rule still applies to the rhymes nowadays
Just wave your hands in the air
And wave em like you just don't care
If you used to do it out in the park
Let me hear you say 'oh yeah!' (oh yeah!)
Oh yeah! (oh yeah!)

A time when..
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park

Dead dreams - still bought and sold
I strive and I strive to receive my goal
I'm still not happy up until this day
But I'm chill and I don't care what nobody say
Livin and learnin about the straight up deal
And got by cause I went by just what I feel
Cause I refuse to be mislead
By puttin pipes to my lips and smoke in my head
Think about it, much, much later
Go to school and expand because knowledge is greater
But she chose to lead that fate
Eye to eye with a dick on a $5 date
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goal
Stop walkin through life as if you were blind
You should reach for your goal cause I'm reachin for mine
They used to d-do it out in the park
D-do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park</pre>
