So what we gon' do right now is want you to get involved

[Foxy Brown]
I'm Don like Perignon, peep me
Continously to (take money) indeed
They keep frontin my Firm'll keep sumpin
Fox uh-oh, freak sumpin
B-12 Coupes flossin, high-post, off me
Killin em softly, like Fugees
My lah be straight cheddar, in K sweater
Them pussies fuck dicks, raw dog shit
Bubblin mad chips, hard in the six
Where we at (BROOKLYN!) uhh and you know that
Niggaz'll get dismissed so peep this

Don like Deion, rewind the Ill, uhh, Na Na
Layin in the telon, Stone like Shar-on
Let's see, niggaz say he really, yappin about
How that dick be all that, he blowin backs out

Keep holdin, and I'ma keep rollin

[Foxy Brown]
You know the Na Na is all that
That's why I get briquettes, and lazarus, and all that
In fact, my sex games, all that
Cause when I do my thing, no turnin back
Bet that, I be stashin in C-10
Chrome Lauren, shittin hard in the Benz
Morocco bremen, niggaz scheamin
Shoulda seen em, 850 y'all be men
Gettin his wild on, frontin at the bar
Guzzlin that low, kiko (who he tryin to style on?)
Courvosier sipper, all day
He was ballin, sway while the beat is 360 ways
Anyway, I continues to floss
Iceberg shit on the ass of course
That's how we plays, high-post all day
Come round my way, see a true player play
Fox Boogie, straight ballin all day
You know how I do nigga, Firm way, hey

And let me hear you say UHHHH! (uhhhh!)

[Foxy Brown]
When it come to niggaz I'm game tight, game alright
High-post, I plays, the frame all night
Alright, life's ill, push twenty mil

Pretty niggaz too but I'm, seein you, uhh

Bitches a dime go loco for that flow doe
Shit, it's dangerous, peep the wrist, uhh

Tell her fuck the mink, she want a persian Land

Pure shan Don frontin, to start sumpin
He buggin, lustin over nuttin, cause I'm gone
