[G Child] (Xzibit)
That's some good dope
Ain't nuttin' like some good dope
Yeah, umm hmm
That's some good shit, man
Woooo, Spaceketeers
Hey, This is the G-Child
We back big baby
Ooo, ahh (Ahahh, ahahh)
I think I need a fix
I think I need a fix, man, uh

[Warren G]
Warren G, G'd up (Uh)
Fuck that blaze the weed up
Got a problem? Best to ease up
Ain't no fightin', I raise the heat up
Gotcha bitch knees up
And by the end of the night, it's beat up
You say you eat dicks, then bitch, well, eat it up
But bring a few friends that's X-tacy'd up, what

[Snoop Dogg]
Now all I see is we, LBC, 213
G's 'n fleezin', the reason, the season
The click's off the heezy, Mr. Warren G-eezy
Gots to make it easy for Snoop D-eezy
To come back and drop raps and make snaps so easy
The most haunted, and most wanted
With a pocket full of hundreds
You know how we run it

1-	[Nate Dogg]
	You can catch the bus if you runnin' (If you runnin')
	But, oh, no, the game don't wait
	No, the game don't wait
	All my homies that next to me hustlin' (Hustlin')
	Cause they (The game)
	Know the game don't wait
	No, the game don't wait (Game don't wait)

[Xzibit]
It ain't nothin' like a one night stand, a night tan
And a big chest got me feelin' like a brand new man
Roll some doe and nigga gimme somethin' to smoke
Say she didn't love the status, she just love the stroke
Restless, beat the pussy til she fallin' asleep
Athletes trippin' off a couple a thousand a week
Just to do the same thang
I didn't even know this bitch's name
She was in my car givin' me brain

[Warren G]
X to the Z pass the M-I-C
Anticipation 213 (Ah)
We contimplate (Ah ha)
And regulate (What)
Now we got the game tight
It's money ta make (Money, money)
The game won't wait but you can wait for the game
Worldwide tour, with skirts screamin' our name

[G-Child] (Nate Dogg)
Ya know I can kinda dig that
Because the game don't wait on anybody
Ya know, I need a fix (Game don't wait)

[Nate Dogg]
Shit don't stop because the game don't wait
I got no time for no damn lunch break
I got to go out and buy some brand new clothes
And change my socks fore they reveal my toes
Shit don't stop because the game don't wait
The hookers flock because the dick is straight
Let me teach you what I already know
The shit don't stop, so it's time I go (Game don't wait)

[Snoop Dogg]
Youngsta never bite the hand thats feeds you
Proceed to give back to your folks and loccs that need you
We do, we always keep it on the true
213, that's the name of the crew
It's true, that the dirt i did as a kid got me _Caught Up_
But I was brought up with the M-O if a D-O
So for your info, nigga
I been doin' this before I hit the radizzo
Snoop D-eezy is off the heezey
So you can make mine, extra cheesy
The crew's a twist cuz it consists of
Three riders, Eastsidaz, one love
