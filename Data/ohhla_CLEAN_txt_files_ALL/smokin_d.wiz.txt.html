Typed by: AZ Lyrics

That's all the fuck I do man
Work my motherfuckin ass off

Smokin', drinkin'... [x28]

I've been smokin', I've been drinkin'
I don't know what I was thinkin'
I've been high all weekend
Drunk as fuck but still tweakin'
So high I can't hear nobody
I can't even feel my body
Goin' need a paramedic prolly
She off that cookie and the molly
This remind me of that mafia
Gettin' bread, now I'm popular
If you hatin' keep it on the d-low
Gotta shout out to my youngin' p low
In the club, man we smoking pre rolls
Want me in your club? Need a couple zeroes
Bandz a make us hold up plans
Roll up all them grams
And my new car and the new cars
See my new chains, say I went too far
See the watch face, say that's too hard
When I put gold in my 2-4
I did it just to match my pinkie
And probly just so these fuck niggas could see me
While I'm

Smokin', drinkin'... [x28]

I've been smoking, I've been drinking
I don't know what I was thinking
I been high all weekend
Drunk as fuck but still tweaking
Damn bro, I'm fucking fried
Say you high as me? You a fucking liar
We so strong it make you cough
Teeth grinding, rolling heavy, tryna shake, you got it
Suck the shit, it's hella corny
Molly got me hella horny
Fuck it, let these bands play
Bet these bitch so what these bad say
Then there go your baby momma
Looking like she want a problem
Fuck it, I'mma give her some
You never let her out, so I'mma make er come
All over this damn place
Poppin poppin like champagne
Poppin poppin like dry bige
You can't connect to my Wi Fi
I'm sky high, look at me
Now fuck these niggas
Let me get back to

Smokin', drinkin'... [x56]

That's the one
That fever right there</pre>
