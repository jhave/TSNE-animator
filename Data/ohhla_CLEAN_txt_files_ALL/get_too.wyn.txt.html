[Chorus: Babyface]
I'm not saying this to shake you up
I'm just saying this to wake you up
It's all good when we making love
All I ask is don't take our love
For granted, it's granted
My love for you, is real
Baby if you don't love me
Somebody else will
So don't you ever get too comfortable

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah to the left to the left
If you want to leave be my guest, you can step
Feeling irreplaceable listening to Beyonce
But ok ill put you out on your BDay
Now if you rocking with Weezy
Bedroom in the bank, baby we safe
I got game like E.A.
But I want to let you play
And don't I treat you like soufflé
Don't I look at you like I see a new day
And don't I do what I do say
I'm through talking so I'm a let you, Face

[Chorus: Babyface]

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah let me catch my breath
You talking bout leave baby you ain't gone yet
And if you leave, leave correct
And I'm a send a jet to pick up the next
And if you leave, you're leaving the best
So you would have to settle for less
I am no Elliot Ness, I don't handcuff I don't arrest
I do confess to the virginsy
Cause under them sheets I am a mess
Yes, baby you blessed
Not chess don't jump your nest

[Chorus: Babyface]

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah, it's no sweat no sweat
I will never 1, 2, 3 4-get
About you, your love, your sex
You know I work you out like bowflex
Our jokes, no stress
Love live life proceed progress
Make sure the neighbors get no rest
We can get together, never disconnect
Your back, your neck
Funny how that song hasn't got old yet - to us
So let's project
You stay in, never incorrect
FACE!

[Chorus: Babyface]</pre>
