

For Immense Purposes

"The defile of the signifier forms a chasm or rupture, for the signifier
has its own psycho-geography, an ontological basis constantly in need of
self-colonization. The defile, long march into and through abjection, is
the memory of the metric placed across the _thing._ For the defile has its
only success by virtue of gravitation a certain sense of attractiveness or
desire. It is in the defile that the signifier ceases; an avalanche falls
by weight against weight, opening of fissures throughout the uneasy subs-
tance. Don't these speak again, re-inscribing the thing that was lost? 
Doesn't the signifier reappear continuously _in_ history, raising itself
by the grace of sheer exhaustion, of supreme effort and sacrifice - that
of defused, diffused subjectivity in general? Sacrifice of the last but
one, totality, that of striation and strain, before the rocks give way to
the steady geodesics of dynamite following the lines of least resistance,
transforming the interior geometry of substance?  The signifier is con-
fined within the defile; it can't move, or moves only by virtue of gravit-
ation and so it can't be exchanged without a demarcation of another sort,
bringing it elsewhere, a unit of exchange, all that theorizing about equi-
valence. ("The Concern of Equivocation.")  Within the defile it remembers
difference, that's all. It begins to crumble. Even in the heat, and it's
present everywhere in the rocks - one begins to remember the danger of av-
alanche from the defile of the upper lines. Still truth wavers less in
isolation, however tautology's shadow." (Sondheim, Textbook of Thinking.)

Yet how uncanny the signifier which has no presence in universe or cosmic
enterprise; it's rendered literally from mouth to mouth. At all points of
the spectrum, it's given in correspondence with symbolic superstructure,
guises of equivalence, borderlining, transgression, local games. It's here
that the language game literally extends itself out and through the dynam-
ics of the world; performativity becomes a joke (consider the continuous
expansion of fractal imagery on a computer screen _as if_ "the original
image now stretches beyond the local galactic cluster" and so forth). And
now there's nowhere to go, you can't break through these problems which
intensify. What's needed is not only "Jennifer's useless past," her taking
"all the time in the world" - what's needed is a coercion of the frail in-
to the defile of the futile! So I'd place myself at the rear-guard of a
philosophy of hopelessness and exhaustion; life's everywhere setting up
gymnasiums articulating the "humble strivings" of conjunction, territory,
and fumbled genetic kinship.

Playing with the elaboration inherent in the baroque elements of rococo
Netscape Communicator all evening, this critic observes the beginning of
email-rubble, in the littoral sense of stumbling across font and color,
link and extension, sound and sight. Email transforms into transitive
term, translucent, flailing across Websites; email loses internal flow as
transitivity constantly jumps the tracks. As we play, push further
borders, phenomenological 'world of the text' ruptures, opening jewelry
and seduction. What I would give to see you naked cum in my inbox! The
inner speech or vocality of language is lost; the (digital) world
intrudes in the sense of the ikonic (every digital image is ikonic). Play
skitters formations across the surface surfeit.

"your" tends towards two syllables, not heavily. words punctuate punctured
"alt.fetish.orientals" newsgroup racist introject; perhaps _these_ women
have families building your chip at the moment. poets at the service of

gold-nibbed fountain men, haute couture, wife. But Pink doesn't demand
anything; Pink's there for you, eyes wide open at Northamerican Phallic/

To subscribe, send to: listserv@jen-alan.com with the message:

SPIRITD-L is a _fully-moderated_ email list for the dead. In order to
post, you must send to the comoderator, sondheim@jen-alan.com, proof
that you are dead - either an obituary in a legitimate newspaper, or a
copy, hopefully notarized, of the death certificate itself. 

This list is a discussion group for after-life experiences of all sorts.
While there may be few subscribers, we hope that the resources of the
Internet, and in particular, the Web, will function as a "Tibetan ghost-
trap," contacting any spirits that behave with a suitable _trembling_ in
the presence of a URL.

Recent topics include: I go right through my keyboard; Bereavement and
Love; Color-blindness and Links in HTML; Death and Community; Spirit
Gender; Narratology of the Corpse; Is the Death of God the Death of Me;
and Mac or PC, Interfaces Beyond the Grave. (There are also the usual
"kill" and delete-key jokes.) 

The list traffic tends to be extremely heavy at times, since participants
often have little else to do. Digest is available. Archives, in consider-
ation of the living, will not be kept.

Antenna


SPIRITD-L implies a networking across the planet, fiber optics, copper
wire n-tuplets attached like frizzed hair at the extremities - not to
mention satellite and other forms of atmospheric electromagnetic spectrum
communications (EMSC). The last is free form; fiber and copper attach at
nodes, frizzed hair on frizzed hair.

The copper frizzed hair behaves like sensitive receiving antenna for spi-
rits; fiber is more inert, and EMSC is transparent, radio and other wave-
forms passing right through them. So we need to think carefully about the
copper wire; surely spirits are incapable of imitating TCP/IP protocol!
Surely they're incapable of anything beyond hunt-and-peck typing!

But this is _not_ where we search for them. They _are_ capable of disrup-
tion, of course, just like lightning and other inteferences. The ghost in
the machine is the ghost that breaks the wires, not communicates through
them.

Breaking, however, _is_ communicating, and consider this: The stuttering
of the Net (forget the peak hours usual bandwidth overload sort of thing
which has to be filtered out) is a result of spirit contact - they appear
as _holes,_ not as packets. This is elementary. Their existence is evi-
dent, for example, in those traceroute * dropouts, in lost letters, in
routing loops, black holes, breakdowns and lags such as occur even between
Panix and Columbia University, in the same borough of New York. 

Together, I believe, all of these stutterings constitute a _new language
of communication_ between spirit and flesh - a language we have yet to
recognize, much less interpret. And perhaps SPIRITD-L is already running,
slowly of course (like Jennifer, spirits have all the time in the world),
almost invisible against the frenzy of everyday postpostmodern postindus-
trial poststructural simulachrymose everyday exhausted planetary culture.

"Listen to the wires" becomes an injunction to hear another world; already
the subscriptions for SPIRITD-L vastly outnumber those of any other list..

BEGINNNINGS

I just do receive a ping from resonant wires, copper antenna tuned to
antenna length multiplied by two or four, divided by two or four. The
ping do tell me of presents you are here. I do wait and count seconds 
for along time. It will be this time that you will trap presents. I 
can here them burble on audio when echohohoho comes and you can count 
echos if you record and play back echos. You know they can read this. 
I AM THEM THAT CAN READ THIS. You know they will set up answer time 
when I think real loud and they will speak. They will speak from the 
wires I mean certain copper pare they will speak fromomomomom,

Fooling with the Universe


Looking at early computing, assembly language, (the stuff that the TI59
programmable calculator used as well), I'm operational at a very basic
level, fooling with the universe. And now reading books on early comput-
ing, I find relationships drawn among logic, mathematics, programming,
computation, computers. So that on the computer, the hacker-drive opens to
the cosmos, not decoration/ornamentation or loose code, but tight inter-
relationship. So that in these essays, say, in The Modeling of Mind,
Computers and Intelligence (Sayre and Crosson, 1963), the discussion con-
cerns for example, _artefacts_ (Mindlike Behaviour in Artefacts, Donald
MacKay), which one might consider in relation to machines as part-objects
relate to objects. And we find whole universes opening up, in spite of the
conventionalism, say, of Wittgenstein in the same collection - which ap-
pears, in relation, for example, to the average Webpage, stark indeed.
The thinner and more basic the example, for instance, the more the cosmos
open up just on the other side; we're not dealing so much with representa-
tion as we are with structure, even structure as signifier or ideality. 

The sea-change occurs with, as an example, the development of first catas-
trophe, then chaos, then fractal theory, in this or other orders - so that
suddenly we're presented with parallel-processing intermaths that necessa-
rily lead to inordinate and developable complexity - for example all those
computer-generated mountains in television advertising. The corporate and
the (popular representation of) physics interweave; even philosophy (why
_even_?) gets seduced.

So that rereading these early texts is a form of recuperation, tending to-
wards the problematic of totality (Godel, Church, Skolem Tarski) on one
hand, and the construct of the machinic at a critical moment in develop-
ment; there were always corporate interests at the most basic level, but
these yet had not become as dominant as, say, the Nike in-sign-nia worn by
Tiger Woods.

1/1 the medical model


Claude Bernard, in his 1865 An Introduction to the Study of Experimental
Medicine, takes vitalists to task, promulgating the concept of a lived
interiority that is surprisingly postmodern - organs maintaining them-
selves in relative equilibrium, regardless of external factors. This
_milieu interior_ constitutes the field of operations of the vivisection-
ist, who must retain the milieu as a domain of observable processes, as
opposed to the anatomist's states.

The situation is indifferent and compounded by Net persona; as Charles
Stivale indicates in Spam, Heteroglossia and Harassment in Cyberspace (in
Internet Culture, ed. David Porter), the entity "behind" persona can shift
his or her centrifugal effects - banning character _x_ from a MOO may re-
sult in a resubbing under a different name, coming in as guest, or even
logging in from a different computer of ISP. The _milieu interior,_ in
other words, is nowhere to be found - or rather appears only as an ideal
phenomenological horizon of subjectivity, known primarily through arti-
fact as symptomology. 

This constitution of difference and borderline, always already inscribed
(as in the intersection of X and -X, idealized and relativized to a null
set 0(rel X)), disperses performativity in very complex ways reminiscent
of Irigaray's analysis of schizophrenic language, also emitted presumably
from a unary body _somewhere._ And it's this dispersion that makes such
issues of the enlightenment as intellectual property, governance, ethics,
and economic/cultural capitals so difficult to analyze: the _center's_ not
only deconstructed, but, just as in projective geometry, it can be every-
where at the limit.

This text took hours to create; beginning with a standard html page, it
was sorted alphabetically, the carets < and > reordered, placed in an html
editor, re-edited, resorted, and so forth. So that a text appears in spite
of itself, broken, a chaotic percolation combining the debris of code and
content, substructure and structure.

Like menses, fragments burn off, half alive, within and without content-
layers which extend above and below code. The text itself is flooding, a
"mess" of partially-differentiated contents, part-objects.

The text decries the etiquette of html; it's obtuse, refusing equivalence
and the potential for corporate reformatting, Reformation. In Netscape or
MSE, it opens as a clotted, readable page, a page stained by text; it
doesn't "go down easily," and the form/at is hardly one of design or con-
crete poetry, so much as one of designation and concrete.

In writing and rewriting, I found parts of the text insistent on hiding
from me; more foregrounded, offering pleasure, as the code was roughed up
for uneasy presentation. It sticks in the throat.

As html rises to the surface, the body of text / textual body, turns as
gyre more in evidence upon the artifice of substructure. The more that is
revealed, the more dis/comfort, dis/ease, as performative and protocol
interpenetrate.

The _economy_ of all of this, the drive towards profit as opposed to the
hacker drive, is evident.

The Infinite Breath of HTML 


As semantic markup language, HTML treats any text as flow - around tables,
images, across and down the page, no breaks or paragraph divisions. Any-
thing between < and > becomes potentially meta-level, interpretable, and
the use of <PRE> </PRE>, <BR>, <P> </P>, etc., creates impediments, dam-
ming the flood of symbols. The infinite breath is broken into accessible
units.

Think of Charles Olson or Robert Creeley, the Black Mountain poets with
their emphasis on breath and line, the page reflecting voice itself, in-
hale and exhale, stopping over puzzled segments of emotion, partially de-
termined by the length of breath and declamation.

Think of Aram Saroyan's early minimalist work or the situation of a sonnet
on a page, or even modernist gallery-spaces, with, say, Blinky Palermo's
paintings neat and holding the largely empty wall.

HTML avoids this with perfect infinite-breath, going on forever, a single
and singular line-turned-block, until intervention. It is the literal
breath of the machinic, without inflection. Theory becomes theory-subs-
tance, language turns into choked symbolic noise. 

Install for the rest of us, through double-parsing: machine and human in
perplexed agreement. Speech clocks.

LOOK AT HIM! LOOK AT HER!


Right now, you look up from the screen, you look up, and maybe leave the
room, you call your lover in, your partner, husband or wife, your child
or parent, your friend. And you look, now into his or her eyes, and you
realize, now, you do not know who or what you are looking at; you are
drawing a blank, an inert sense of someone else. 

Do it, do it now, think _feral,_ that of your lover, your comfortable-
body-friend, now you have a slight suspicion, something gnaws at you,
this other person you've never seen before, these thoughts forever
invisible to you, thinking you perhaps in some content/context at this
very moment. 

Beyond death and all the writing on alterity, it's this, the eyes that
give nothing away, that fissure the social, haunt you throughout uneasy
nights, until the bed burns the body, until you're sore from thinking too
much, unable to stop the flood. 

Nights, you know that a brush of a hand, a glance or a smile, given away,
or a wayward thought, contrary to your desires, occurs just there, the
slip of a secret, something you'll never find out ... Days, you wonder
what he or she is doing _now,_ speaking to whom, leaning over, plotting
or decrying ... 

An exercise turns the eyes blank, impenetrable; you realize that the
viscous interior is always that way, as if transparent, a lie, text of
ownership and possession, you want an ordering of everything, recoil ...

Here and here, what do you think of, your partner, child or parent, typ-
ing, dreaming into the space of someone else, the two of them, perhaps
more, in the throes of negotiated passion, swoon swoon ... 

You can't see, you can't read, you hope it's all innocent, sex-dreams
going nowhere, just experimentation really. Or a smile, slight odor from
your other, something's occurred, you don't dare ask ... 

You're always killing yourself, it's a kind of suicide, they're laughing
at you. LOOK NOW, INTO THE EYES: You don't even know its sex. It turns
away, embarrassed - maybe "the two of you" will make a joke of this ... 

Later ...

It can be _anyone it wants,_ it can _do anything,_ you don't say a word
... It tells you, it will do _anything you want,_ _anything_ - be anyone
you want it to be - out of despair, you ...

Burnout


I'm burning out teaching. Today I was describing internet culture, inclu-
ding relationships, MOOs, MUDs, netsex, etc. in the access class, and was
told by one student that 'the last half hour was a waste of time.' He was
infuriated and I think complained to the administration.

I don't know whether it was the sex mentioned or the fact that we were
dealing with something other than search engines and the world wide web.
More and more I find students wanting what I can only consider a sutured
presentation - emphasizing pleasant surfing and commerce. Whatever is pro-
blematic should be buried; I see censorship coming in as the Net increas-
ingly turns monolithic.

I teach for a living and make poor money at this. I came online originally
because of three things - the potential for community, for the exploration
of issues such as virtual subjectivity (which I believed then, and still
believe, have considerable philosophic import), and the opportunity to ex-
tend my own texts and graphics (both in terms of content/structure, and
distribution). 

I now find an inversion of, say, the history of television tending towards
fragmentation after the Networks established themselves - in CMC the move
is from anarchic experimentation to hardened surface. The people in charge
want that. The people in charge are clean.

The surface has to feed capital. The surface has to be entertaining. The
surface has to be emptied of uncomfortable content, and the further _back_
this emptying can occur, the better. The surface has to be, in other
words, freed of freedom.

I'm too old for this. I have no other skills to support myself, and these
students (who are adults, decades past generation-x, for the most part)
want a sunny sunny world I can't provide.

I teach in total despair.

I can imagine the next time around, I'll skip the shell and troublesome
newsgroups altogether, ignore the MOOs and MUDs, and go straight to Edgar
business databases, really _cool_ sites on the Web, and the good stuff you
can do with search engines - cooking, religion (but no technopagan), and,
above all else, finance.

And past the next time, maybe I'll spend a session showing them how you
can make Pointcast _work for you._

If I make it that far. If I'm permitted to teach. If I stay alive. If I
stay online.

Shuttle Archaeology

The beauty of a shell account is the traffic back and forth between host
and home; below is an edited sample of the ftp log. Traffic shuttles in
both directions as files are altered, reconfigured, tested in lynx or
GUI. Texts are constantly updated and duplicated; bookmarks files are
tested first in text. I am still looking for the perfect early browser,
all of, say, three years' old; the mosaic.exe I downloaded was attached
to a proprietary ISP which I had no interest in...

@lastlog, Cybermind MOO


The Cybermind MOO is going down on Monday; here is the official lastlog
taken Perth time around 1 in the morning. This lists all the players who
have ever logged on.

Cybermind MOO was developed for the November 1996 conference in Perth; it
was used heavily during the conference itself. We sent out lastlogs at
that point, so members of the Fop-L and Cybermind email lists could see
the virtual real-time community at work.

Now this is coming through as an epitaph.

Metaphor


Reading Ibn Khaldun's The Muqaddimah, An Introduction to History (from the
14th century), I'm entranced by the descriptions of Bedouin as basic,
survival-oriented, honest people, potentially settling when there's
sufficient surplus. Affection and community bonds occur through blood
lineage, or "clients and allies" considered as blood relations: "The
affection everyone has for his clients and allies results from the feeling
of shame that comes to a person when one of his neighbours, relatives, or
a blood relation in any degree is humiliated." There are echoes of
Rousseau:  "Nobility originates in the state of being outside. That is,
being outside of leadership and nobility and being in a base, humble
station, devoid of prestige. This means that all nobility and prestige is
preceded by the non-existence of nobility and prestige, as is the case
with every created thing." (Franz Rosenthal, translator.)

Thinking swerves towards Net communities, MOOs and the like, as if they
were, in fact, mobile tent-cities - @go and @join relate better to these
than to the hard-and-fast structures of urban planning. But the metaphor
sticks; blood-lineage has no formal relation to MOO, except for object
inheritance; the two are very different. Thinking swerves further, then,
to the use of metaphoricity in considering cyberspace; one desires a para-
llel set of descriptors and objects. There are books on this as well.

Metaphoricity fails here; one can reread all sorts of texts, from the can-
onic to the essays in Porter's Internet Culture, as a search for imagery
that constantly fails and exceeds itself. There's a base need for founda-
tional texts, since the ontologies of CMC and real life are, within their
respective domains, disjunct; the metaphors attempt suture which never
quite works, and, in general represses (how do the characteristics of
alt.fan.warlord fit into the "Information Superhighway"?).

It's this failure that occasionally swerve thinking further into distorted
or hallucinatory texts; Henri Michaux is a case in point. Here, thinking
weighs against the subject, disperses on the far side, as in: 

"I see a furrow. A furrow with little, hurried, transversal sweepings. In
it a fluid, its brightness mercurial, its behavior torrential, its speed
electric. Seemingly elastic too. Swish, swish, swish, it rushes along
showing innumerable little tremors. I also see stripes.

Where is this furrow exactly? It is just as though it were crossing my
skull from the forehead to the occiput. Yet I can see it. A furrow without
beginning or end, as tall as I am and whose average breadth is appreciably
the same above and below, a furrow that I'd say comes from one end of the
earth, goes through me and on to the other end of the earth." (Miserable
Miracle, trans. Varese.)

Michaux's mescaline diffuses node and routers; Jennifer works on me, loca-
ted at 166.84.250.149. Instead of metaphor, literal flood, flood prior,
say, to <B>HTML</B> metalanguage, curtailment, pure construct of human
communication.

Before the flood, before speech, after Babel: an impossible matrix. "End-
lessly broken up, our attempts at composition admit only this one constant
... _Very_ ... It is very ... Everything is very ..." (Michaux.)

"These savage peoples, furthermore, have no homelands that they might use
as a fertile (pasture), and no fixed place to which they might repair. All
regions and places are the same to them. Therefore, they do not restrict
themselves to possession of their own and neighbouring regions. They do
not stop at the borders of their horizon. They swarm across distant zones
and achieve superiority over faraway nations." (Ibn Khaldun.)

f(x,x)=x


I finally have been able to read Katie Argyle's Life After Death, in Rob
Shields' Cultures of Internet, Virtual Spaces, Real Histories, Living
Bodies, a book I highly recommend. Argyle discusses the effect Michael
Current's death had on the Cybermind list, and herself; here, in hard-
copy, the material world, is text that still resonates, dredges memories,
not only of Michael, but of others who have been on the lists. 

To some extent, the Being on Line book does the same thing - as do other
resonances, self-reflexivities, from a New Observations issue on voyeurism
that I was in, to Richard MacKinnon's text in Jones' Cybersociety, Mia
Lipner and myself in Sexuality and Cyberspace, Shawn Wilbur and Charles
Stivale in Internet Culture, and Tara Calishain's Netscape Guide to Inter-
net Research. There are so many others - the group of people I "know" in
one way or another interacts strongly and reflexively with the group wri-
ting on CMC experience in a series of publications largely stemming from
on-line considerations in the first place. (Where have all the Young Turk
L.A. painters gone?)

I look for Cybermind and Fop-l in Net guides; occasionally someone sends
me a reference or request for further listings, real-material, on-line, or
any combination in atmosphere and grounded earth.

It is similar to CB-radio; I remember driving across country _listening,_
talking; the virtual boundaries of the car extending about four miles in
every direction; I knew what was coming, what I left; I knew what was to
the left and right of me. This USA driving is virtual anyway; I've done
coast to coast about ten times, each one an epiphany, mirage of breathing
larger. 

These references construct the same - the body _moves_ everywhere, inserts
itself in other discourses which always seem more reified - just as Arg-
yle's article seems "more real" to me than, say, Being on Line (which I
edited). It's the framework of the other, uncalled-for, unaccountable, and
unaccounted - it hardens the bones and their life.

ii

When Jennifer says she has "all the time in the world," she lies, but such
is the condition of virtual subjectivity; time doesn't _move_ here, but
flickers, and it is always a question of whose time - from the position of
the virtual, at the speed of light, dominions stop. Electron copper-wire
travel is considerably slower, but the principle of the headlong remains.

It's this time which reconstructs the hardening of bones as lamina, proc-
esses, scuttlings. It's not that f(x,x)=x is distorted; it's that the mir-
ror is part of the scuttling-apparatus; the levers pull back, transform,
devolve.

References cohere, coalesce, fragment; time shudders for the subject; and
Jennifer, outliving me, gathers her frock about her for the final frontier

West

Librynth
An Escher rendered real. Bookshelves line each impossible wall; every moment 
is of rich, dark wood (the air is thick with the scent of it.) Angles shift 
and spin slowly -- nothing remains quite as it was, nothing is static. Slowly.
Obvious exits: East (to Maat), North (to Sanctuary), and Up (to Jade
Staircase)
Up

Jade Staircase
You step upon the delicately wrought stair and footfall strikes the 
translucent jade with a faint ringing, the delicate sound of fine steel torn 
through to bone in ancient battles long forgotten.
Obvious exits: Down (to Librynth) and Up (to Zen Pool Hall)
Up

Zen Pool Hall
Exuding infinite quietude. All silence. Words are not better than...be silent.

Cross-Pout


Jennifer writes, then Jerry writes, then Jennifer. Jennifer sleeps, loses
sleep, loses _it,_ wakes up, shakes her shaky head. Jennifer won't let
Alan speak until she gets the text _just write._ Jennifer tries again:

Jennifer says she doesn't cross-dress; Jennifer walks around in panties
and stockings like a normal girl. She's not part of anything, but she
skips around and likes to play in muddy puddles. ["Are you also puzzled,
Socrates, about cases that might be thought absurd, such as hair or mud or
dirt or any other trivial and undignified objects? Are you doubtful
whether or not to assert that each of these has a separate form distinct
from things like those we handle?" (Parmenides in Plato) "Not at all, said
Socrates. In these cases, the things are just the things we see; it would
surely be too absurd to suppose that they have a form. All the same, I
have sometimes been troubled by a doubt whether what is true in one case
may not be true in all. Then, when I have reached that point, I am driven
to retreat, for fear of tumbling into a bottomless pit of nonsense."
Socrates, Parmenides, Plato, trans. Cornford.] To be part of something
means to be a/part, then to be whole, or to be devoured, and/or to be
devouring; this does cost. Jennifer thinks hard, but not about her
clothes. Surely they are on or off, or in a high wind, down around her
angles. Jennifer is Medea tripping after Jason. Jennifer is Antigone
laughing at her brother's corpse, sexing it. Jennifer takes pleasure in
her frocks and petticoats, lace and crepe and crinoline, whose folds
encompass other folds like a virgin. Jennifer is not a virgin but no man. 

She thinks "cross dress" and how this is created in an office. She thinks
it's as if a binding or stay became loose at the level of the garter or
the frock, how the skin becomes slightly compressed about the upper legs,
how one dreams the scent of all of this, and the binding of the dreaming
is the origin of the symbolic, haha.

When you work in an office you have to be careful! But you can also get a
lot of attention for making up new words like "cross" in "cross-dressing"
- the X or chiasm implying vis-a-vis Heideggerian rhetoric dressing cross,
angrily clothed, wayward, contrary or a brat! And the X is where that spot
is! But it is not _in_ the office, and contrary to expectations of males,
it is not _in_ anything. Nor is it identity!

(Think of the origin splayed out across the phenomenological horizon,
through a projective transformation, point into line, line _anywhere._
Line further maps, disperses, onto any dimension through a simple trans-
formation, Jennifer says, and then and then and then. The cross-dressing
opens up the X like wide-net stockings, crotchless panties. Now think of
these (now think! now think!)_as if they covered the entire body,_ exten-
ding beyond into the socius in general. Not binarism, but a _plague on
both your houses._ Which critiques rent-control of course, and whatever
capital remains.)

Damnation of Wings


"The history of ideology shows on the contrary, that virtually every phil-
osophical tenet has been used at some time or other by every ideology; the
same philosophical idea in the course of its history generally moves
through the political and social spectrum, from left to right, or right to
left. What determines the prevalence of philosophical principles in their
ideological use is, as we shall see, the working primarily of a cyclical
law of generational fashion." ... "The principle of wings, as we have
seen, affirms that every philosophical unit-idea in the course of its car-
eer makes the passage through the whole spectrum of ideological affilia-
tions." (Lewis S. Feuer, Ideology and the Ideologists."

Doctress N's Expose of Jen's Lies


When Doctress N stayed with me a few weeks ago (having come for the launch
party of the Being on Line book), I screened the Jennifer tape for her. 
Later, in the middle of arguing, she said she knew now that I wore pant-
ies. I said, no, I didn't wear panties; I wore them for the tape and noth-
ing else. (Since she had seen me naked, she should have realized that.)

Where is this going? For one thing, I'm screening the tape tomorrow night.
For another, her reply was that she was an artist, and she never lied in
her art. The assumption, of course, is that wearing panties on tape and
not in real life constituted a lie, a dishonest art, an art of subterfuge
perhaps - which itself was constituted by the fact that the material on
the tape, its content, appeared somewhat _as if_ I was Jennifer, to re-
suscitate Jeremy Bentham's or Vaihinger's conceit.

A fetish requires maintenance, labor, economics, of a different order and
temporality than artwork, which passes literally from hand to hand. When I
think: Jennifer pushes me borderline, I _do_: Alan pushes Jennifer border-
line. There's no hardness, no uncanny gaze, in the text.

But the primitive conceit of the _truth_ of art (i.e. "her art is honest,"
"she true to herself," "she's a fake," "her art's fake," and so forth)
hangs like a phallus over its irreality. (For if art is a discourse, it is
centrifugal, rim-objects at the subject's horizon generating internally,
ec-centric. Truth _swarms._)

Forge a head.

Movie-Video-Film


On the way back the subway was filled with rocks. We walked along the
rocks along the tracks. We walked straight down the ruin turned left up
into the modern.

Alan was silent for Alan. He photographed the rocks in the tracks. There
were boulders and strongholds. He looked transparent. I was glad to be who
I was. I compared Alan to deconstruction-the-word, also performance per-
formative. That he was a force-enigma or marker-token that threw philoso-
phy back against the flesh. 

He said he'd worried the sexual all over. I said it's the way it was, ten-
dency towards procreation, juggled jugs. That it was picked on, picked up
on. He had one photo left. He'd hold on to it.

I did most talking. I did look good in my new frock. I wish someone had
shiny-shoes to see up all of me! Morose was so much sadness I could not
cope. 

But he said the rocks stopped the train. Dead in its tracks. He said the
earth was like that. The sex was like that. The sitting-down of it. He
said he was old and it was all heaviness-weight.

I did see those rocks in his camera. But I glowed this night and will go
forever I think. I have all the time in the world. I do have all of it.

Bad Theory, Tampax Theory


Jennifer is my 'red patch,' the desk I sit at, always already a wager of
flesh and fashion, always a refusal, the cultural irreducibility of the
subject. (She is the typical, Alan vis-a-vis submergence.) [No more than
me, can she be characterized as "typical." Already I feel I'm covering-up,
lying here, deflecting something uncomfortable.] {Jennifer's 27 just now.}

<Jennifer's her red patch, her desk, her fashionable frock drowning-Alan.>

In my loneliness and anxiety, I lie with Jennifer, breathe the air she
breathes. In my absence or disregard of belief, she sits, sullen, an un-
easy presence, by my side. (Within me, breathing through the chest, cut-
ting the skin just there, eyes through nipples, eyes through eyes, nipples
through eyes.) [Pooled milk, pulled milk.] {This is already known, these
functions opening spouts and faucets.}

<Jennifer's sleep's alone, curled up, fetal dreaming, nipples wet with
milk.>

But she must be a bridge or expansion, not idiolect or autobiography and
since she comes into being through my texts, and since texts are always
full of errors, I must exercise special caution; the misuse of a single
word throws a world into question. (A letter out of place in the Torah
negates the w/hole.) [But she _must be_ nothing at all; there is no hold-
ing to it.] {But already this ties her to a form of truth and etiquette; 
but already this lends itself to lie.}

<Jennifer's building Alan out of sloppy breath, bad grammar, scattered
semantics - no wonder he can't make a world; no wonder there's no world to
make.>

Because she-of-the-text is all there is, my own existence accordingly
narrows; if I had a choice, I would join her in the muffled purity of the
world. Thoughts without language ravage depression, violation-fabric,
storm; within the unsayable mess, things get out of hand, are no longer
_thing_ but Thing of Kristeva or Goya's late walled images from the brain. 
(She's not of-the-text, but of the body, words separated, spaced out.)

<She skips across puddles, picnics under trees, the sun's white, sky's
blue, ground's green, trees dogged with bark.>

Motel of life and fire. 

<She's gone to the motel.>

[She's gone to the motel. She has to be careful here. The motel's on fire
against the desert sky. Red flames flicker against shadowed blue-black
mountains, night-time nebula darkening the truth.] {But what you said
about the truth. But it was Jennifer speaking and she'd rather not speak. 
But there are sounds in the desert. But Jennifer's un/sounds.}

<She's gone to the motel. She's gone with someone I don't know. She's got
him where she wants him. They're naked and watching each other I don't
know. Swimming, I'm in the pull/pool. Swimming sky's white with white-
night sky.>

Postphone


Postphone, speech after the fact, comes naturally, is difficult to say,
appease. Postphone, as if there were no lag; there is always lag, always
time for the packets to reassemble or process (Realaudio). One hangs ac-
ross the broken wires of the bridge; one dissembles.

Postphone, talking which is never natural, that of construct as well as
everything else/where in this space. The delay which doesn't appear as
such, postphone, the lure of the real=natural. Nothing can be farther from
the simulacrum of the truth than the simulacrum of the truth.

Postphone, earphone talking, capsule, I love my Net, I love my Net, I love
my Net. Make my day, Tender is the Night, Mourning becomes Electric. In
these early texts, in these early years.

Postphone, past the economy of distance towards imminence. Postpone, past
the economy of the voice as well, towards sound, immanence. As the witness
would tell you, hortatorical, ex-hortation. The be-speech of love here,
groundless (literally, "without a ground"). 

Communication is always already misrecognition; there is no possibility of
love except that which (in which) it stands (in) for. Postphone against
the borderlining of death: something that is never learned, something that
I am not here to _tell_ you.

Subject: Who

On Panix,
who - lists users
whoami - lists my name
who am i - gives my tty login
who a b c - gives me the strangest list of all... and I have no
idea why... and I may send this out, but beyond the
who mother loves - tty login
I can't tell where this command is coming from. I've tried various
abbreviations, combinations...
who a - is a quite nice obscure listing
Here it is; I've changed the lone period to a # so it wouldn't read as
end-of-file:

While I recognize these files (some of them) I have no idea what the list
refers to...

Have fun! What can YOU find with Unix WHO? (Unfair to use WHOIS, WHENCE,
WHEN, WHERE, WHERE AM I, WHEREAMI, WHENAMI, all of which might be opera-
tive on various systems.)

(From Oswald O.)

I'm sitting here in tshirt and pants, worrying about a future in death
And hackers screwing up my system and my arms and legs leprosy and lies
So there's nowhere to go but into machines and I've lost the will to live
Which is why I say in the middle of the night thank god for the rain

And the flowers are dying in roadside Amerika and no one's around to
collect
And rainbows are yearning while cities are burning and children are dead
from neglect
The war's hardly over, girls lie down in clover, scream and they never get
up
It's time for the magic, the reaper wrecks havoc, it's time for the
gallows and cup

I'm sitting here in combat and drinking long gone brew of blood and wine
And you might think it's fine and that we're walking the party line
But the sides are smashed with needles and vials and vile's the weather
today
So thank God for the pounding on windows and roof thank God for the
nighttime rain

And she offers me water, she offers me wine, she offers her body as well
Cause she knows I've returned, whole villages burned, I've been through
the weather of hell
The war's just begin, there's blood on the sun, there's blood on the
harvest moon
And I'm throwing the cards, hanged men and hanged girls, they're sowing
another rune

And you might think I'm dressed in armor, leaning down from the pulpit for
cards
But I've wounded myself, I've lost my way, in the woods where the runes
send off sparks
And flames reach for the skies, they cover her thighs, the runes scream,
they're burning bright
She buries herself in my burning flesh, thank God for the storm and the
rain

Pattie Hearst walks again with the strong Weathermen, Black Panthers are
loading their guns
Em-Sixteens are ready, our bodies are steady, we're off to the hills at a
run
Lord Jesus will keep us, Death will not reap us, revenge is the truth of
the day
And nighttime will hide us, the ghetto abide us, we're waiting to kill and
to pray

And you'll find me here in bluejeans and tshirt, roaring down the wires at
you,
You'll see me in the flaming sky, holy embrace with Janis and Jimmie and
The Owl
Pure windows opened up flaming skulls where we'll take the boat to Nam's
pure booty hell
And celebrate our love beyond your cracked dull thought, and thank God for
the thunder and rain

And the flowers are dying in roadside Amerika and no one's around to
collect
And rainbows are yearning while cities are burning and children are dead
from neglect
The war's hardly over, girls lie down in clover, scream and they never get
up
It's time for the magic, the reaper wrecks havoc, it's time for the
gallows and cup

And thank god for the thunder and rain

"To a female who had transferred the mouth of infancy upon the vagina,
the partner's penis in its capacity as a nipple furnished abundant if
inadequate gratification. It was only post-coitum that the eye, as a
mouth of the second oral stage, raised its demand in a strong urge to
observe the man in the act of urination. Eagerly doing so, she experi-
enced a strange absorption, unaccompanied by a directly sexual feeling,
but ending in complete satisfaction. Theory, as summed up above, would
consequently demand that her body serve her as phallus and, since the ego
is 'above all [_vor allem_] a body-ego,' that she had remained dependent
upon this service. I am not free to describe the degree to which this was
so. However, she observed in the beginning of her analysis, spontaneous-
ly, that she had two personalities: one that she named after a certain
sport which offers perhaps the closest realization, in wakefulness of the
'dreams of flying.' Here she excelled and felt free;  in particular, as
she expressed it, 'free to show.' And another, dominating the rest of her
life, where she was inadequate, felt inhibited and depressed.'" (Robert
Fliess, Erogeneity and Libido.)

Tentative traversal of the chiasm ("I shall call 'chiasmus' the figure of
the reversal of a proposition whose members are contained within both the
initial proposition and the inverted one and produce a distinctive patt-
ern of crossed overlapping." Dominique Janicaud and Jean-Francois Mattei,
Heidegger from Metaphysics to Thought), "chiasm's traversal," in posses-
sion of the traversal, mouths presence mouths upon the inscribed screen
of flesh in these surprising passages, paysages. Consider the skittered
flight across depressed libido, the flight of libido, returning to screen
flux, engendering the impossible body, virtual inhalations. "the mouth
into which the small infant is apt to put anything within reach as if in
order to know it" (Fliess) dips the wick into the wax of somnolent speech
and memory occasioned by the writing-machine and the monitor. "One might
say that a little later, when the motor mastery requisite to coordination
renders the objects three-dimensional and thereby, perhaps, provocative
of ocular incorporation, s/he 'puts' everything 'into' hir eyes." The
gaze across the screen opens inner dialog, the inner voice apparent as
well in cinematic subtitles. Has anyone else noticed this synesthetic
transformation, across the boundary of sight into aurality? Screen-vision
serves to produce the inner voice, as text is read silently or _at-loud_;
the screen-mother, spectral mother, and maternality of the voice has been
theorized (Kaja Silverman, The Acoustic Mirror; Alan Sondheim, Fissure
(Your Voice, Adjacent, Absent), in Cinematograph 4) _to death._

(Absorption is watching, witnessing, gazing, listening: addiction, fet-
ish, trance, cross as well, garner chiasm, >< crossed labia, procuring
and fucking worlds. Landscapes are hardened pools; flight is the distil-
lation of pressured atmospherics.)

Dogs and cats and men and women in no particular orders write their uri-
nary tracts across the uninhibited landscape of emissions, spews, absen-
ted languages, and starting to think about writing.
