Why is it ladies only out for money?
Brothers only out to get hoes?
If you really want to rock it with me
If you wanna hear a brother kick flows
Participate!
Ladies let me hear you say "Ow"
Brothers let me hear you say "Ho"
Everybody in the house say "LP"
If you're on the East or the West Coast
Believe that!
What I don't understand is when Lootpack steps in the jam
Brothers wanna bob their head but somehow cannot slam
Sometimes I can relate, but I cannot take
Paying ten dollars just to watch no one participate
I think to myself, "Lootpack, make that crowd lift,
Make that crowd jump up to your surround gift"
But before I bust a mic check this loud teen
Attempts to pick-pocket the mic from Jack in front of the scene
As I come with frustration and coordination
My crew gets in attack formation and takes 'em out
