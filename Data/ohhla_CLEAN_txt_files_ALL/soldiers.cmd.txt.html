[Mac]

we watch them die holdin' their riches and they bitches
diggin' up ditches for the snitches in this ghetto 
will it happen makin' some white rappin' checkin' out my toes
tell my hoes I never rest 'til they murder my foes
when a cop done shot when a cop done dug and I watched 
them bullets snatch me lookin' at my camoflauge
makin' sure they didn't blast me
when I die bury me in my camoflauge cuz I'll be down with
my thug motherfuckers other niggas ride 'til its over 
we gone live and breath soldiers

[Mia X]
