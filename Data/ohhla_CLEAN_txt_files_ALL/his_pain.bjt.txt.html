"This is the way I feel"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died
A day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside
A week before he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes
Two weeks before that, couldn't pay his rent cause he lost his job
A month before that he lost the custody of his daughter
Six months before that her mother said she won't see her father
And this before he did a year when them charges was brought up
I shook my head, turned around, then found a hundred dollars

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar] *2X*
I don't know why he keep blessing me
I don't know why he keep blessing me
I don't know why he keep blessing me
I don't know why he keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why

[Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday I invaded privacy of a home
The day before that my partner had fronted me a zone
A week before I had loaded bullets inside that chrome
Two weeks before that I shot them bullets and he was gone
A month before that I cursed my mother then slammed the door
Six months before that I hit my woman, she hit the floor
I stormed out, then seen a black Honda Accord
Them hollow tips missed me, then hit that little boy

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar] *2X*

[Kendrick Lamar]
So today I laid in my bed, stared at the ceiling
Closed my eyes, then asked myself how I was feeling
I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
Is my life coincidental or just God willing?
I came to grips, jumped up, looked out the window
Seen my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know
Bullets is nameless, I guess this was meant for
me to give him a hundred dollars then trash my pistol

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why he keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why

[Kendrick Lamar] + (BJ the Chicago Kid)
So I can bless you (you, you, you, you)
So I can bless you (you, you, you, you)
So I can bless you (you, you, you, you)
Yeah, you (you)

[BJ the Chicago Kid]
Lord help me, cause I need you
I know this weed is burning, and I'm on drink number two
But it's all to soothe the pain from this cold, cold world
Sometimes I think you can help me (help me)
But this bus here is temporary, so I'm talking to you
This sick world will drive a sane man crazy
(Dead birds dropping out the sky) daughters having their father's babies
And this the news I hear
when I got kids, nieces and nephews turn a year
I wonder, will it get better?
A little cheddar when it get better?
But the rest of that's cash
Make last year's Christmas gift be my bad

[Chorus 3: BJ the Chicago Kid] *2X*
But somehow you keep blessing me
But somehow you keep blessing me
But somehow you keep blessing me
But somehow you keep blessing me
But somehow, but somehow, but somehow

[BJ the Chicago Kid]
Ohhhhhh, yeahhhh
Somehow you keep blessing me
Ohhhh, yeah-yeah-yeah
If I just keep the faith, yeah-yeah
I know you'll be right there
Sometimes it may not seem that you are there
But you're there, I feel you're there, you're everywhere
And I thank you for protecting me in these streets
from danger seen and unseen
I never know what happened the night I wasn't there
Something told me leave, so I left
It was the next morning, three got shot after the club
All listening to that small voice, oh you saved my life</pre>
