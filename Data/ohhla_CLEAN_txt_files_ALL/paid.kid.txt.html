Oooooooo Yeahhhhhh
And while your out gang bangin
Tring to catch a murder case
Your hoes on my couch gettin fucked in the face
Bumpin to the base of some old school rap jam
This aint tennis, but yo I'll use my backhand
On any grown man that tries to check rock
I wanna head bang, I gotta hip hop
Cause I'm gonna stick with what got me paid
Lickin that coochie with the high top fade
I'm self made like Henry Ford
I'm on this mic but it feels like I been here before
I want more than the next man
Respect, plus to cash big checks
And mack on hoes like Ruddy Ray
Cause the reach around just sounds so gay
I dont even swing that way
I told you hoes before I'm the K
I to the D R O C K'n, rhymes sayin, guitar playin
Turntable spinnin at a basement jam
No fame, no money, but you wouldn't understand
What it's like to be so real
You got the beats and the rhymes, but you aint got no feel
I dont need the fancy music to make mine
Just the beat and the funky ass base line
Drop a couple cuts on the track
A tracks to the mother fuckin wack
So while your making record that dont recoup
I'm in the house gettin paid like Snoop

Kid Rock an' I got all the hoes sayin'
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me baby all night long
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me 'till the break of dawn

I want my khakis washed, starched, and creased 
I want an order of fries with a side of grease
I wish for peace throughout this land
I want the whole fuckin world in my hands
I want a band like the US Funk Mob
See I can rap I dont hafta lay sod, just to make ends meet
October 31st yellin Trick-or-Treat
Boy aren't you a little old to be trickin
You see my mask and bag bitch, I aint bullshittin
Hittin homeruns like Rusty Staub
I'm kinda anal, cause I ain't no fuckin slob
I'm the cradle that's able to rock any format
But still I'm labeled and treated like a doormat
Where's the whores at?
Westside hoes like cars, so I ride em for a test drive
I'm like a pringle, I wont go soft
I got a new jingle, I'm about to go off
Hey ho, check it out, I really like to turn you out
And if you be good to me,
I'll yoodle in your valley
Kid Rock aint nothing nice
Got the salt and pork boomin with the beans and rice
Got a head full of lice cause I'm such a scum
Got a pocket full of money, but I'm dressed like a bum
Got a business mind, so if I loose the funk,
I'll still be in the house gettin paid like trump
Kid Rock and I got all the hoes sayin'
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me baby all night long
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me til the break of dawn
Come on, come on, come on
Oooooooohhhhhh Yeahhhh
Fuck me baby...let it ride, let it ride
Fuck me baby come on, come on...somebody
Fuck me baby...oh yeah
Love me baby...oh yeah
Come on yeah, all night long
Baby, come on, fuck me baby
Come on and do me daddy all night long
Come on and do me daddy all night long
Come on and do me daddy all night long
Come on and do me daddy all night long</pre>
