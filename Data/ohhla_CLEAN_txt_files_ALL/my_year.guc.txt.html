[Intro]
It's my year, it's my year
And look at my chain, my watch and my ear
It's my year, it's my year
My engine in the rear, because it's my year
It's my year, it's my year
Just look at my chain, my watch and my ear
And look at my gear, and look at my gear
My engine in the rear, because it's my year

[Chorus]
It's my year, it's my year
And look at my chain, my watch and my ear
It's my year, it's my year
My engine in the rear, because it's my year
It's my year, it's my year
I do it on the strength, how I be the pimp
It's my year, it's my year
My engine in the rear, Drumma Boy
It's my year

[Gucci Mane]
It's me, not you
I don't want you no mo'
I swear, I don't care
I'm turnt up, I'm burnt up
And turned out, and you're not
And I am, the Gucci Mane
Don't get it be like dammmmn, stop
They know who I ammmm, hot
I'm icy as a fool
I knowwww, I knowwww, very well, very well
I made, this well, uh-huh
And I know A-T-L, very well
I make mail, fuck 12
Go to Hell, A-T-L
I know them well

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Play-errrrr
Bottle drunk I don't sailor
And I'm, tailored
But I keep tippin waiters
Youse a, hater
And you should get some paper
I got, flavor
Big house no neighbors
I'm so, papered
I drop wax on scraper
I'm a, baker
And I'm bakin up cake-r
I'm a, player
Bottle drunk I don't sailor
And I stay, tailored
And I keep tippin waiters

[Chorus]</pre>
