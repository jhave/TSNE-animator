[Intro]
Yeah~!
One time dis ya boy DJ Montay right
We doin this shit for all my motherfuckin hood niggaz
All my niggaz that beat'n down they block
Big Oomp Records, DJ Unk
Tell them niggaz how you ride nigga

[Unk]
I'm poppin my collar, I'm grippin that wood
My kush in my hand, my trunk beatin good
If it's knockin they jockin, feel that bass that's a hobby
Beat through yo' hood them kickers kick off in yo' ass like karate
They hear that bass wanna try me, honk at Greenbriar Mall
I pop my trunk and all them hoes did the Westside walk
I'm with Montay in the South, system soundin so mean
26's make it stretch, sittin high like Yao Ming
Big Oomp down for my time, trunk thumpin somethin crucial
Bumpin B.I.G. and T.I.P., hit up Club Crucial
On my waist is a Ruger, love my bass and my amps
Adjust ya tweeters make it sweeter, chain bright as a lamp
They feel me

[Chorus]
I'm beatin down ya block and you can hear when I'm comin {*4X*}
Can you feel me? (Crank it up) I know they feel me now (I know you feel me)
Can you feel me? (Turn it up) I know they feel me now (I know you feel me)
Can you feel me? (Crank it up) I know they feel me now (I know you feel me)
But can you feel me? (Turn it up) I know they feel me now (I know you feel me)

[Unk]
Yeah they bumpin the Camp, candy paint lookin good
And I know that they can feel me half a block from the hood
From the block hear you good, yo' trunk don't sound so clear
I bump like D-Lo tell me lil' nigga do you hear what I hear?
Speakers front to the rear, it's DJ Unk in yo' ear
And free walk chain let it bang, for what shorty we here
See how my name just appear, on CD players and screens
DJ Jelly DVD's jump from scene to scene
Fo'-fifteen hittin mean, tote the scope and the beam
Turn it up a notch, bouncin off the roof I'm clean
Steady stackin my green, money high as a star
And the best part about it is the bass in my car

[Chorus]

[Unk]
(Then I heard) From the amplifiers (DAAAAAAAAAM~!) can't bust 'em
Cause my speakers built from West Coast Customs
Customized sound, trunk shakin the whole block
TV screens in the dash, champ playin the X-Box
Yup I'm beatin down ya block, fo'-fo'-deuce sittin tall
Bend my hat back, knockin down pictures off your wall
A-T-L comin hard, beatin hard in a droptop
Old school Chevy's, color candy, call it lollipop
Cutlass with the T top, Buick with the brains out
SS Impalas and Cadillacs stay pimped out
Smoke 'dro then peal out, smash the gas I'm on my way
Beatin down your block, fuck nigga, get up out my way

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Nigga Oomp Camp all up in yo' ear nigga
DJ Montay, DJ Unk, that's how that shit gon' always ride out nigga
Keep your motherfucker speakers fixed nigga cause we gon' bump forever nigga
Oomp Camp signin out, Big Oomp bitch</pre>
