Lil' girl from the ghetto
Ran away from home
She ran away from home (Nananana)
Tried to be a fucking woman
Acting way too grown (Tooo grown, whoa whoa)
Then she ran across the border
Homie, 24-inch chromes (24-inch chromes nananana)
Now she walking down the track, stripping
With them brand new high heels on (Hahaha good God)

[Warren G]
She too young for me so I passed her to the next dude
Got hood fame, what a shame what X' do
Hang with a crew that love getting revenue
With a description of 1972
Now who's the mack in the 'Lac leaning to the side
24s gleaming, sitting up high?
Ride and won't die but you young bitch
Spit words so fly, get you sprung, bitch
Young Slick, his name, chasing Don Juan fame
Trying to replace him with modern day game (We don't hate)
Then shoot if you mess with his prostitute
And what I hear, he got a lot to shoot
Now what if dude get your crew Slick got one too?
Don't let the pimpin' fool you, he got hot ones too
Blew his brains out, now he catching chain out to Chino's
Slick got caught up fucking with a young dogg

[Snoop Dogg]
My nigga Slick was a gangbang motherfucking lunatic
Nigga out to get a grip, sworn in to do this shit
Nigga only do this shit and make this shit official
A little bitty nigga quick to hit you with the pistol
Ain't no motherfuckers squabbin' me, and that's on 20s
Plenty niggaz felt the wrath of his deuce-deuce gun blast
Ask Cuz on the corner with the bullet holes his chest blast
Dumb-dumb don't want come test
Cuz he'll lay you to rest, tattooed with a set on his neck
Demanding respect, Crip or die, is how he ride
Long Beach, East Side roll in two times
Every nigga on the yard know Cuz' rep
A straight gangsta for life, and I love that
It's not just a job, fool it's a lifestyle
And when you're slipping, woo-wam-lights-out

[Nate Dogg]
Lil' boy from the ghetto
You're greased up khaki's on (Nananana)
Used to be a ball player, homie
What the fuck went wrong? (Whoa whoa)
Used to see him on the corner daily
Hand up on his throne (Ahh yeah nananana)
Tried to knock him off a bank recently
25 to life, so long, he gone</pre>
