What time is it?

It 6:47 AM when I look at the clock and cough
6:50, the alarm goes off
I stumble to the shower, brush my teeth
And get dressed as I try to find something to eat
I spot a cookie in the kitchen drawer
And at 7:34 I'm out the door
Sitting in traffic, no escape
I'm gonna be late, work starts at 8
I check my watch and it's 8:03
Finally I arrive at the j-o-b
I get to my desk, what's this mess?
New projects? I'm already stressed
I sit stunned till 8:15
By 8:31 I'm ready to scream
22 messages on my phone
I just got here and I wanna go home

I wanna go home

9:30, my stomach is startin to ache
But I have to wait a half hour for my break
Bless, somebody just called in sick
Coughin and wheezin, yup, the whole shtick
More work for me, it's 10:42
Someone says, "The boss wants to see you"
At 10:47 I'm gettin yelled at
I was gonna yell back but my voice fell flat
I'm still ( ? ) at 11:39
And that's when I'm told they cut my lunch time
Mandatory meeting and all I can do is groan
I wanna go home

I wanna go home

(You got to have a job
your feet on the table)
(You got to have a job
to keep the family able)

(How long until I can go home?)

The afternoon's draggin, it's 2:02
When I'm laggin, avoidin what I'm s'posed to do
A co-worker gets on my case
Tellin me I need to smile, I hate this place
At 3 o'clock I walk outside
Standin by the backdoor try to hide
Gotta make it till five, then I escape
3:30, they ask me to stay late
First I say, "Sure," then I say, "Wait"
I can't, I've got an appointment to make
Then, at 4:10 they ask again
The manager's actin like he's my friend
Hmm, let me think about it - no
I'm ready to go, see you tomorrow
It's 5 o'clock on the dot so you gotta leave me alone
It's time to go home</pre>
