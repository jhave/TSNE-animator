1st Verse:
(Monteloco)
I hit the strip with chips for the tricks
Monteloco vocal guaranteed hits
Thugs in the club with the bud burn it up
He say DJ homie turn it up
Malibu and OJ filling up my cup
Haters stay away I kill'em with cut
Spit game flame hot like fire
Monteloco and Stocks McGuire
In the Chevy ready to rock steady
Balling free falling like Tom Petty
Baby Baby you look so sexy
You say no but you always let me
Never sweat me treat player right
Don't trip you know I hate to fight
Raw dog stilo break them off rough
Playa for life baby never enough
 
Chorus:
(Female Singer)
Monteloco my Playa Poppy
I want to do you I want to do you
(Repeat 3X)

2nd Verse:
(Stocks McGuire)
Who want to ride what come on get buck
If you got it going on ma press your luck
Mami's they can't handle Stocks when I twist then 
Like bamboo I'm in their head they thinking its shampoo
My games cold shoot hot bids &amp; claim hoes
I ride up cuff like cops in plain clothes
My whip stay fresh back seats is for head &amp; sex 
Pimp thug it be read in text
Can you picture Stocks with backwards feelings
I spit game like a ratchet peeling pretty thug style 
maxamillion if I touch it I'm building
You must undrstand that thats why my ex's ran back
Only wifey gets the right to lounge freak get bounched
Off the walls til my nieghbors say pipe it down  
This black burgular through your window hit your jewels
Leave a rose with roach of Indo, what

Chorus:
(Female Singer)
Monteloco my Playa Poppy
I want to do you I want to do you
(Repeat 3X)

3rd Verse:
(Monteloco)
Special players make special plays
In special games todays the day 
From NY to CA check the resume
After I hit it I might let you stay
Let you lay around the house like a kitty
Pretty pretty girls want to hit me
Lick me quickly please no hickies
Basic instinct the way I kick these 
macalicious lines all you fine dimes 
Its my time shine my time to rhyme
Vato huapo papi Eddie
Got you breathing hot and heavy
Like Pac said I rap for the ladies
Make the gangsters act more crazy
I know you got me new clothes you bought me
And I love it I love it when you call me

Chorus:
(Female Singer)
Monteloco my Playa Poppy
I want to do you I want to do you
(Repeat 3X)</pre>
