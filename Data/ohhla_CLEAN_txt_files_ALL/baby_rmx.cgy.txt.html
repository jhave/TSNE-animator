Now everybody in my clique got a clover chain (yeah)
So even when I ain't around, they promote the name (yeah)

A baller, baby

I'ma cook it in the kitchen for the price of the raw (raw)
I've got black diamonds, quarter million villas on shore (shore)
On a white sandy beach with them kickers and whores (whore)

Cause I won't settle for nothin less than more (more)
