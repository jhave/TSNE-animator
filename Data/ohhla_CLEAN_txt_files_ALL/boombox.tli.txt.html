[The Lonely Island]
Imagine in your mind a posh country club
The stuffy old money where the poor get snubbed
The spread is bland, sauerkraut and boiled goose
There's no way these people, will ever cut loose
But then I walk in the room, hold my boombox high
And what happened next, will blow your mind!

[Singer]
Everything got outta control
The music was so interesting
Everyone got out on the floor
It was a bunch of old white people dancing

[The Lonely Island]
Now picture if you will a bunch of business men
Stuffed in the boardroom like pigs in a pen
The ties around their necks are like a hangman's noose
In the middle of the table theres' a boiled goose
The old people smell makes you want to puke in the sink
These dudes'll never dance - yeah that's what you think~!
I stride in the room all young and hip
Hold up my boombox, and say listen to this

[Singer]
Then everyone started to move
People rejoiced instead of financing
Your preconcieved notions were shattered
By the super old white people dancing

[The Lonely Island]
The Big Apple, where people never dance
Spirits go down while profits expand
The cops or the dealers, who's got the juice
The street venders peddling their boiled goose
So many types of people, they'll never get along
Till I bust out my boombox and play this song

[Singer]
The music washed away all the hate
And society started advancing
Every demographic was represented
It was a rainbow coalition of dancing
WHOAHHH-ohh-OHH!
Everyone was wearing fingerless gloves
WHOAHHH-ohh-OHH!
I saw a Spanish guy doing the Bartman

[The Lonely Island]
Transport now to an old folks home
Where the elderly are tossed on their brittle bones
The orderlies are stealing, there's no excuse
Everyday for lunch they eat boiled goose
So I grabbed my boombox and hit the turbo bass
And what happened next, was a total disgrace

[Singer]
Everybody started having sex
The music was way too powerful
A bunch of old people fucking like rabbits
It was disgusting to say the least - OHHH!
A boombox can change the world
But you gotta know your limits with a boombox
This was a cautionary tale
A boombox is not a toy~!!!</pre>
