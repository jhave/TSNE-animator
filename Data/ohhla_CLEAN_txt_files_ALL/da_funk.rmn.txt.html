Verse 1, Redman (Reggie Noble) talking to himself:

Yo, yo, yo check this out
Yo, yo we gon go back to the old school right now
Yo, yo Red
Yo, what's up G?
Yo, yo, yo check this out
I believe there's no nigga out there as funky as you
True
So, what we're gonna do, is we're gonna go back to the old P 
Funkadelic 
Get the fuck outta here, word?
Remember that old cut you did?
Yeah, yeah
That ol' P funk cut?
Yeah, make my funk the P funk
Yeah, yeah, that's it
Well, what we gonna do is we gonna reminisce on that ol' shit
Word?
We gon go right back to the old school, but before we do
I wanna know is my niggaz in the house?
Hell yeah!
I said is my motherfuckin niggaz in the house?
Hell yeah!
So everybody just light your spliffs up
Yeah
Get your skunk weed and light that shit up
And let the funk be your guiding light
You heard it comin from the lungs of the funkadelic brother himself
More funk than a bag of skunk 
Twice the funk that James Brown's socks
Hit me
Hittin you straight across your notch
Wit a tune
Yo, Redman, drop it

Chorus:

Make my funk, the P funk
I wants to get funked up

Verse 1:

Make my funk the P funk, we thump 
Lyrics that bounce the brain, make emcees jump
Sky high 
Can't touch the level so why try?
Fall Guy compare me status to fly guy
Rough and rugged, and brother it takes ten to conquer
That's why I'm on probation
Ever since three, I cut throats of emcees
Mediocre lyricist who burnt with degrees
Of two-ten 
Not from an oven, but mac ten
A mac twenty maybe if I didn't subtract ten
My background straight from a black mans culture
Want more, buy the video or Redman sculpture
For your mantle, damn you
Too hard to handle
E Double slam once, and Redman slam two
Break hooks, earthquake shook the state of NJ
Okay, bust the big gate
For microphones that have swollen mic cords
PE fights for power
Redman fights for soul power
Funk is strong as a tree trunk
Ask me the flavor
Make mines the P funk

Chorus, Repeat 2X

Verse 2:

I'm back with the funk, chump
You want funk, how many lumps?
I got spunk
I'm well known like Donald Trump
I'm not...
