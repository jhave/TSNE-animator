[Intro: Bizzy]
Yes indeed
Let me just take a moment out right now, to sit back and relax
(I truly believe that it's you, that's it's you)
YouknowhatI'msayin?
(I truly believe that it's you, that's it's you)
After life, After Platinum, Records

[Chorus: Krys Ivory] + (Bizzy)
Just take a second, a second to thank you 'fore I lay me down
(Ooh, it ain't nothin like a prayer to get me up in the mornin)
And nowwww (just a warnin to the spirit, it's you)
I wanna, I wanna let you know (I truly, I truly believe that it's you)
I wanna, I wanna let you know (that it's you)

[Bizzy Bone]
I say ooh, let me take a moment
It's just to get my thoughts together through the stormy weather
I say now ooh, the Lord is omnipotent
And I been down, and I been around, and the Lord know it
Your faithful servant, warrior slash poet, now hey
We gon' get this money baby, ride anyway
Ooh, gotta get our pape's together, gather around
Check out the sound, bring 'em up to break 'em down
Now ooh, let me take a moment, and what's my name?
(Bryon) Mr. McCane, we know the game
And you, are all I need you know it
It's all good, we goin forward, my door's open
We gon' ride, and we gon' rise, and we gon' slide
Do what you wanna, don't leave me, you're not gonna
We gon' ride, and we gon' rise, and we gon' slide
Do what you wanna, don't leave me, you're not gonna
I say ooh, it ain't nothin like a prayer to get me up in the mornin
Just a warnin to the spirit
It's you, I truly, I truly believe that it's you
That it's you, that it's you

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
And ooh, I see the water flowin, they not knowin
But I'm knowin, and now they know 'em
Yes, so very fresh, don't settle for less, they're beautiful
And dude'll go pick us up from the funeral
Bless, I'm so impressed, and plus the kids to rest
And yes, it's all love, all doves, all the best
Bizzy rock it 'til the wheels fall off, and pick it up
What's up, what's up, what's up, hey homie what's up? (ha ha)
Let's keep it poppin, praise God, the Father is the creator
If ya ever get in a fight I just don't want you to hate her
This is a, crazy life and a crazy world
This is the breath that God gave us, let it swirl
In a circle twirl, with the fox fur that's purple
I love my people, everybody in the stars, don't hurt 'em
This is the breath that God gave us, let it swirl
In a circle, and twirl, with the fox fur that's purple
I say youuuu

[Chorus]  2X

[Bizzy Bone]
I truly believe that's you - I can do a song for y'all
Stand tall, stand small, cause baby we stand for all
Different worlds, save the secret of course, I wanna save Sierra
Coca-Cola, Motorola; baby you know, I know ya
I'm still here for ya, cause you the best for me
The best for B, even if we can't get married
I said carry my baby just like we're doin it for the world
You a pearl, and so much more; everything you got in store
You're more, you're more, you're more, you're more
You're more, you're more, you're more - I truly believe that it's you
Yeah - I truly, I truly believe that it's you
That it's you (it's you) that it's you (I truly believe nigga)
I say youuuu

[Chorus]

[Outro: Bizzy]
Babyyyyy, babyyyyy, babyyyyy, babyyyyyy
I truly believe that it's you
I truly, I truly believe that it's you {*laughing*}
I truly believe that it's youuuuu
It's youuuuu, baby it's youuuuu (you)
Baby it's youuuuu (you)
Baby it's youuuuu (you)</pre>
