daaa... da da da...

[Chorus] {#1}
"My Style is the craziest"
Hilltop
"That style is the craziest"
Suffa you know your rhymes amaze me just
"Get on the mic"
Let's show em' who'se craziest

[Verse 1: Suffa]
This be the Suffa MC enhancing the track
I treat the mic like a show girl, romancing her lap
So when it's time for tips don't forget my rhyming tricks
So live it's on the (starlist???) cos I got the vinyl licks 
Ya spine'll rip open and I'll make your mind eclips
Independant, giving major labels minor fits
I'ma rip, (polyflip??) and give MC's them siezures
You're rapping like the Dala in Indonesia, I see ya
And it's your fate I see, it's like a two dollar hooker with HIV
You wanna step and be friendly? I'll rip your style apart
You'll end up like Kenny from Southpark
So just try to fade me, just try to fade me just, try to fade me kid
we're the craziest
I've seen others and I was like "shit he sucked"
I bring the stress to your chest like a hooker getting titty fucked
This kid errupts from the hills, I guess he got skills so
MC's are getting treated like a dyke with a dildo
It feels so good you'll moan like Tabatha Cash
As Nick scratch this vinal like the record had a rash
Like cash I'm errupting, styles have you suffering
The air that you suck has your lungs rupturing
Suffa bring invincability, ya can't hurt me jerk 
Just pass a cold one cos it seems thirsty work like

[Chorus] {#2}
"My Style is the craziest"
Hilltop
"That style is the craziest"
Pressure you know your rhymes amaze me just
"Get on the mic"
Let's show em' who'se craziest

[Verse 2: Pressure]
Now this be the capital pressure, from Hilltop these MC's flex
deeper than the bonet proof of nexus (??) the MC says
'The Hoods release text
I bet that you'll release threats for the next to sweat'
Now please let ya mind follow me like a preist to his panthem
The anthem, if they left standing then I hand them
The tool of my trade reflects the trade of my tool
I cool in the shade now Suffa take em' to school
But it's cool, MC's are made to be broken like rules
I take my chance and either walk away a king or a fool
The waters deep my friend, you can't wait your turn so
They choose to burn boats then turncoat like Cherral Kerno
They'll learn though, as time takes it's course my rhyme breaks the force
Of ya spine to make ya toss, so convulsive, so repulsive until your mind is numb
Now just stop your encroaching by, your time has come
Now I'm the one, but to tango it takes two
Cos MC's be talkin' hard times but to me it's easy 
I ran through life's lessons, tript on, survived destines
to shoot my fate, could ecumulate my mic lessons 
But I didn't - I made what I got from just the spittings and persistance 
I got to nurse my baby, what's the differnce?
A little patience and let time be, you go through situations 
lessons full of life's vibrations

[Chorus] {#3}
"My Style is the craziest"
Hilltop
"That style is the craziest"
Next you know you cunts amaze me just
Get on the Next
"Show em' who'se craziest"
