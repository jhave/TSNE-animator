[Chorus]
Just gots me a crib and a new car too
I got the ring, but I gotta have you babe
C'mon let's get married babe
C'mon let's get married
Let's have some kids with a dog with a house
A lil white fence, just like this, babe
C'mon let's get married babe
Let's get married

[Jagged Edge]
Meet me at the alter
In your white dress (your white dress)
You won't ever need another man
You never, ever want from another thing, no
I've been feeling you
I must confess (must confess)
Ain't no gonna break this thang up
I ain't going nowhere, no
Cuz when I think about you and think about me
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)

[Chorus]

[Jagged Edge]
Said you want some karats
Babe, how bout ten (how bout ten)
Is it good enough for you to brag on
When you show your friends (show your friends)
I just want to be with you
Girl there ain't I think I won't do
Want you to be the one to say I do
We can start a family
Cuz when I think about you and think about me
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
With my tuxedo
He asked me do you take this
Woman to hold and keep the safest
Plus to lace her, floss wit paper
Crib and a car, man you know tha basics
Diamonds your bestfriend
That makes sense because
Your a princess and you deserve the princess cuts
But as long as you gots your defenses up
You can never get the love that was meant for ya
Shouldn't you know that I use to come through wanna
club
Real thugs don't never fall in love
Always on the g-o, for the d-o
Man I had to take t-o, smits some cutie
Since my money get right theses days
I wanna give you more ice than the ice capades
I gots the church, the ring
There's something I'm forgetting
Oh, we gotta have J.E. sing at the wedding

[Chorus]

He's straight out of a neighborhood where niggaz hate
They see you, go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Their stomaches ache while he's loungin' in the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand when a nigga 'scape
House's with a bigger gate, houndin' him's a big mistake
He won't surrender, he'll rather give up a rib to break
'Cuz he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin' hand
'Til he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan
Created a buzz 'til where you gotta mention his name
When you discussin' the illest player that's in the game
And he's ridin' with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and them
G-Unit Records, ain't no motherfuckin' stoppin' them...</pre>
