Next Bid-itch is spotted for sex kiddish is not it
Lookin' for a dick (LEGAL) bitch fo' the whole trap

She come back with' tricks turnin' fo' show taps
So when I come back into yo' town it's a throw back
Cause you know she's comin' back right around fo the ball sack
You didn't know that yo' lil' lady could hold that

[Kutt Calhoun]
Call me a drum major baby I will hold yo' sticks
Hoppin off the tour bus with' about 4 bitches now take yo' pick

Lemme see yo breasticles you sumtin bitch show me love
And I'll show you what this music plus weed and hemmy does

A guaranteed pimp game ghetto super stars
They on the boulevard travelin' smokin and drinkin'
Here go yo tokin' you can blow and get hope for the weekend
By the time it's ova' you'll be sober while we be rollin' peepin'
On to the next botch pickin' out the next box
Leavin yo' wet spot, wetter than ever

Remember how I told ya how we like to roll and like to kill things
The face down bottom up call us the drill team
