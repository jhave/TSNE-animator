Song:   Family Time
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Lift up your hearts with a smile
Lift up your feet with a dance
Lift up your spirits with a song
It's family time, it's family time, it's family time

Hi, how you doing? Hi, how you been?
It's really good to know we still got this thing
When we get together, it's so much fun
Everyone's happy, nobody's got to run

Lift up your hearts with a smile
Lift up your feet with a dance
Lift up your spirits with a song
It's family time, it's family time, it's family time

Now the world gets busy but it's not hard to see
Family means the most to me
I'm so happy we found this time
Now we can all share what's on our minds

Lift up your hearts with a smile
Lift up your feet with a dance
Lift up your spirits with a song
It's family time, it's family time, it's family time

Now we get together, that's how we get along
Now we get the world to sing a peace song
Everyone can see we are family
Everyone can see it's time to be free

Lift up your hearts with a smile
Lift up your feet with a dance
Lift up your spirits with a song
It's family time, it's family time, it's family time

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hi, how you doing? Hi, how you been?
It's really good to know we still got this thing
When we get together, it's so much fun
Everyone's happy, nobody's got to run

Lift up your hearts with a smile
Lift up your feet with a dance
Lift up your spirits with a song
It's family time, it's family time, it's family time

Lift up your hearts with a smile
Lift up your feet with a dance
Lift up your spirits with a song
It's family time, it's family time, it's family time

It's family time, it's family time, it's family time
It's family time, yeah, it's family time
Yeah, it's family time, yeah </pre>
