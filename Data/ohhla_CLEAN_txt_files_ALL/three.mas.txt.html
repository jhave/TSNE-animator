[Nicolette]
Three's my lucky number
And fortune comes in threes
But I wish I knew that number
That even little children seem to see
Oh, I'm missing everything I knew
It's just so hard to be a child
Oh, I'm missing all the things I knew
Yet whinge I knew nothing at all
I whinge I knew nothing at all

Soon i'll have the courage
To leave my thoughts behind
I'll give back all the knowledge
And keep the wisdom precious in my mind

Oh, I'm missing all the things I knew
I miss them yet I want them gone
Yes, I'm missing all the things I knew
Yet whinge I knew nothing at all
I whinge I knew nothing at all
I whinge I knew nothing at all</pre>
