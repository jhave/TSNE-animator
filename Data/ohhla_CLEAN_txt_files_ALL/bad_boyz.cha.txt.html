[Chamillionaire]
I run with niggaz that be smokin' stanky-danky on some twankies
Won't curse inside my verse, but ya misses is tryin' to blank me, hold up
No need to thank me, I'm just tryin' to get my cabbage
Better than average, Chamillion's the baddest even in Dallas, hold up
My trunk don't pop, my trunk stay locked
I got 2 glocks, and 2 15's in the back of the drop
And you can snack on a cock, if you thinkin' you Miss Thang
I grip-grain pull up on chrome, and watch ya lip-hang, hold up
