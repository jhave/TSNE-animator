[Chorus] [x2]
I ain't seen you in a long while
I ain't seen you in a long while
I ain't seen you in a long while 
Hit me when you round my way
I'll be there dog

[Verse One]
Payin' pennies for the Swedish Fish
I miss, just tryin' to reminisce
Back when my niggas was, close like the finger tips
Now all my dogs far away like the distance is
Mars and the Venuses 
All big dreamers with our own plan
Spock used to say, "You got flow fam.
Handle your businesses."
Damn, when my niggas was
Small, we would ball, now
E'ry time Reks take a shot, miss 'em all
Just because we ain't kids no more
Doesn't mean we can't build no more
We gotta build I'm sure
From The Leonard to the Lawrence High
Vote to the corners I
Came across stand up homies on the Lawrence side
Then up in Boston I solidified friendships
Laughed and exchanged tempers
Lot of pain lingers
Handle beef with the two fingers
Peace to my true niggas
Is what it is, what it do niggas?

[Chorus] [x2]
I ain't seen you in a long while
I ain't seen you in a long while
I ain't seen you in a long while 
Hit me when you round my way
I'll be there dog

[Verse Two]
Well crack a brew and just laugh at the old days
Even though you gone we still fam like The O'Jays
Damn, back when Jose's
Mom used to tell him to be home 
We was gettin' into dram up on Prospect
Boppin' on my steps
Had the boom box with the double deck
That was the shit
Miss the old days
No way I'ma forget
Hope my brothers forgive
Continue to live, your mothers at rest
And at peace, at Heaven I know she is
Feel it here on my chest and to the beat of my soul, I regret
Not bein' round and make a call to ya
Just know my hearts with ya
Fuck all the past B.S. 
Through this song, I'ma make sure we continue on
Whatever stresses in life may come, we gotta hope for the best
And oh yes, my man D, just seein' through my eyes
Save a place for him up in the sky
Heaven knows I

[Chorus] [x2]
I ain't seen you in a long while
I ain't seen you in a long while
I ain't seen you in a long while 
Hit me when you round my way
I'll be there dog

[Verse Three]
To all my crew, my squad, my entourage
Uncle Pete and my Auntie Oz, sometimes life gets hard
You get dealt them cards and thank God
We just, wanna be stars
Not like Hollywood, more like
I miss them styles, we improvise try to shine
Rock jewels that'll hopefully blind
Kiss and seein' the pain
Take your mind off of all the rain
The sun gon' shine, I'ma see you again
Promise all of my friends
In the end it's just wind seperating us
And to my man, hope the pen is elevatin' us
I'ma make the time
So I can make the bus
I'll be there dog
You my homie trust
Uncle Neil open up Heaven Gates for us
Sometimes I feel the anger touch when they aim for us
But yo it ain't enough
Just to make the bus
Gotta keep the bond
Nigga stay in touch

[Chorus] [x2]
I ain't seen you in a long while
I ain't seen you in a long while
I ain't seen you in a long while 
Hit me when you round my way
I'll be there dog

"I never thought, I would really see you
I'd really see you again, I'd go crazy"</pre>
