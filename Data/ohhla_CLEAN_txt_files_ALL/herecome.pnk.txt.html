[Intro: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it callin, like a siren (AHHAH-AHHAH!)
We don't, want no problems
We don't like them no, keep it movin
Here comes the, weekend
Set off your, sirens (AHHAH-AHHAH!)
Here comes the, weekend
Set off your, sirens (AHHAH-AHHAH!)

[P!nk]
I just wanna play
Big city, holiday
So get out of my way
If you know, what's better for ya (AHHAH-AHHAH!)

[Break: P!nk]
I'm tearin up the night, lipstick and leather tight
Not lookin for a fight, no (AHHAH-AHHAH!)
High heels and cherry wine, not wastin any time
We're tickin like a bomb about to go OHHOH-OHHOH-OFF!

[Chorus: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it callin, like a siren (AHHAH-AHHAH!)
We don't, look for trouble
Just enough to, see in double
Here comes the, weekend
Set off your, sirens (AHHAH-AHHAH!)
Here comes the, weekend
Set off your, sirens (AHHAH-AHHAH!)

[P!nk]
Drink some pink champagne
I don't know you yet but we'll forget
So, fuck what they say
Let's run the floor until it breaks (AHHAH-AHHAH!)

[Break] + [Chorus]

[Eminem]
Yea yea yea, yea yea
Nothin high class in my glass, only bottles I pop
are bottles of pop, so when I pop up in the spot
I'm prob-ably not gonna be wantin to pop bubbly
or Cîroc, I'm not Puffy
But I'ma +Run the City+ tonight
When I hit it I might act like a frickin idiot, Diddy mixed with a medieval knight
Big city lights, little indignity
Hot diggity, this Biggie is getting me hype
I don't get some liquor I'll hurt you
I'll knock ya dick in the dirt bickerin worse than that bitch in that Snicker commercial
A mixture of Stifler and Urkel
Hangin from the light fixture
I hope you pricks are insured for this building cause we're tearing it down
Security get out the frickin way, Jesus Chrysler LeBaron it's loud
I swear only thing I hear is the sound
of sirens goin EHHEHH-EHHEHH! Cause

[Outro: P!nk]
Here comes the, weekend
Set off your, sirens
Here comes the, weekend
Set off your, sirens (AHHAH-AHHAH!)
... (AHHAH-AHHAH!) ...
Here comes the, weekend
Set off your, sirens (AHHAH-AHHAH!)
Here comes the, weekend
Set off your, sirens (AHHAH-AHHAH!)</pre>
