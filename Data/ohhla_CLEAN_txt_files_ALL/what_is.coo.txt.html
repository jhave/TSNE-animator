[Verse 1]
Yo, the G is off the chain when you come round here
Better watch what you claim when you come round here
You can do your thing when you come round here
But it's blessed that you can hang when you come round here
Ain't no playin games when you come round here
Weak niggas feel the flame when they come round here
We tryina make it bang when you come round here
Everything ain't the same when you come round here
DJ's pump the bass up
And pull the lights back
It's time to get it crackin and we love it when it's like that
Ain't no reason for no treason
So put the hater-ray down in this new millenium season
Who you gon' believe in while you're cheesin?
Ain't no logic or no reason in your teachings
I'm steady on the grind round while you're reachin
So just sit and look and listen, hear my twenty screechin

[Hook]
What is an MC if he can't rap?
How you gonna throw up from the shoulder and can't scrap?
Twenty-five with a L, ain't no gettin back
Where niggaz do it all, homie just like that
What is a DJ if he can't scratch?
How you gon' keep on trickin and stay fat?
Jump your ass in a gunfight without no strap
Where niggaz do it all, homie just like that

[Verse 2]
You can be yourself when you come round here
Ain't no titles or no belts when you come round here
Keep your game on stealth when you come round here
But be about your wealth when you come round here
You get cut and left when you come round here
So don't let 'em see you sweat when you come round here
We'll be makin busters melt when they come round here
So you'd better check yourself when you come round here
We be gettin gangsta with it all through the weekend
Get your lazy ass up, no time for sleepin
Call your homegirls up, jump in your jeep and
They ain't ready when you come, then you're leavin
You're goin to the club, it's time for freakin
You ain't got no ID to try to sneak in
It's on and crackin once again you cheat the G-game
Just open up your mind, no time for tweakin

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fat meat is greasy when you come round here
So don't be acting cheesy when you come round here
You might go off the heasy when you come round here
And we'll still be bumpin Eazy when you come round here
You better watch the greedy when you come round here
Cos some of these fools are sleazy when you come round here
Give to the needy when you come round here
But understand you can't defeat me when you come round here
Most stack a grip, trip and roll with some new friends
Some'll sell their soul to the devil just to chip in
Some'll lie, steal and rob their mama just to get ends
Which one is you nigga?
Where do you fit in?
But this thing don't stop just cos you's a trick
And hatin cos you ain't rich, you's a bitch
we gon' dip like the old school, c'est la vie
Hop your tread like me
Watch what you say and get paid like C
