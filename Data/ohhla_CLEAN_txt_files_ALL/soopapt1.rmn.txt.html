-Would you please read us a story?
-Alright, get over here and sit yo big ass down,
Lemme tell you about the Sooperman Lover...

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I was out to lunch and shit
Puffin' on a blunt to get my head read(y)
Boogie'n to my walkman with an "S" on my chest
(Bust a move!) Yes I'm a Superhero, don't forget
I smoke mad niggas so to hell with cigarettes
But anyway, let's get back to this skit
You know who the fuck I am
So git off that ol' bull-SHUCKS
Lunchtime was up, (FUCK!!)
Let me jet, Or i'll collect unemployment bucks
On the way back, black
I spotted this object, a stray cat
Stuck in a tree, with a tag that says that:
"If found, please return to this address"
(How did you see it?) Nigga with my X-ray eye set!
Like "Pchoooooooww"!
I jetted to the closest phone-booth
Quick fast, I dipped into my Sooperlover suit...

(I can leap,
 tall buildings
 In a single bound...)

BOOOM!!!! 
Right through the fuckin' phone-booth ceiling!
(IT'S A PLANE!) Naw, Sooperman Lover's the name
I can slam King-Kong and pick up freight trains 
On a mission, to save this cat that was wishin'
He was in his litter, watchin' Fritz on channel 6'n
Relaxin, feet cocked-up, just a little
With a cod cocktail and a bowl of tender vittles
I snatched him, took off through the air like a pigeon
Quick so he won't start meowin' and bitchin'
The letter in cat's tag address said THE PROJECTS
(Elevator's broke!) So I had to take the back steps
(Knock, Knock) The door opened  then my eyes swole
from this BADASS DAME (Damn!) Sippin' a quart of "Old Gold"
-"Yo, is this your cat?"
                              -"Awww, yes! Where'd you find him at?"
-"He was stuck in a tree,
  Around Uptown Manhattan"
                              -"Well how the hell did you save him?
                                Are you Police/Undercover?"
-"Naw baby,
  The "S" on my chest stands for:"

[Chorus]              Sooperman Lover   (Yeah!)
                     Baby call him the Sooperman Lover
                     Something wrong...
                     Something wrong, indeed
                     Something wrong. Yes, yes indeed...

[Verse 2]
She was grateful, lookin for ways to repay me
No money, a donut, and some..uhm coffee maybe?
Of course - what kind to show that I thank ya?
Make my donut jelly, and my coffee Sanka
We sat, unhooked the cape from the back
She felt my arms cause my pythons looked stacked
"Goddamn, Sooperlover! Yo shit looks thick
Tell me, how strong are you With muscles like this?
You bad motherfucker!" (I'm stronger than a locomotive)
I'll keep hittin ya like Rocky
She ran to the room and came back with a (?)
Negligee, high-heeled shoes with a blunt in her mouth
Ready to roll up, hey hold up/ she had the dollar fold(ed) up
To mix the coke with the smoke yo, she was no joke
She took a sniff, some got on her top lip
That bitch stuck out her tounge and gave her top lip a lick
and said: -"Here baby, hit it."
-"Naw baby, I ain't wit' it
  You'd need more than a body
  To make me wanna hit that shit!"
But I'll hit the blunt so she took out her fronts
Cracked the philly opened the bag and laid out the skunk
Then I took a long pull it was hype, oughta sight
We ran into the bedroom so I cracked my pants for head room
Later, tossed the covers and oh, brother! I was wit' it
Ready to hit it asked my dick, "YO, WHASSUP GEE?"
"Yo man, shit's thick"
Licked her down her belly and kissed her on her back
Stuck my hands betewwn the legs and I felt the bozack(!)
as big as mine (YO!) This bitch must be craze
So I threw my suit on and I was Swayze...
'Cause I'm the:

[Chorus]</pre>
