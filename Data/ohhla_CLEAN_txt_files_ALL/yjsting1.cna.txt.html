[John Cena]
It's the new energy drink ahead of the bunch
This is YJ Stinger, baby, proud and punch
You get a rush of energy everytime you take a pull
All them other drinks, man, they filled with bull
It's the real deal, baby, and the facts are true
You wanna boost, grab a Stinger made by Stacker 2
You know how we do, this drink is number one
Helps energy, performance, concentrat-ION
So go and get one, or grab 'em by the case
Look for the Stinger can with the yellow jacket face
Drink kicks ass, I don't care about the wings
so go and, "Catch the buzz and feel the sting," uh!
