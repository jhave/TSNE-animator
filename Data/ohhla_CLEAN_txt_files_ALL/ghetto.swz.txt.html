[LL Cool J]
Damn I Miss You....
It's still gone ride, it's still gone ride
Uh uh, uh uh, C'mon, uh, uh, yeah, ride, uh

Damn I miss you
Ooh I feel better than before
We should've never seperated
Paused or hesitated
You rocked me to sleep
It's like my body levitated
Lookin in the mirror 
But the heat makes it less clearer
It's all fogged up, face me baby
Put your fingers in my mouth, let me taste the gravy
Reunited, feel good, real good, squeeze me
I tell you that I Love You 
But you wouldn't believe me

[Chorus - Mashonda]
Ghetto Lovin, when I'm with you 
Anything you want I will do
Ghetto Lovin, when I'm with you 
Anything you want I will do 

[Mashonda]
Hello.... Baby....
There is something that I want to say to you
You've been on my mind now
For a while and I just dont know what to do
I've been thinking of holding you (holding you)
Showing you, what I'm all about
And I promise that I will do
Everyting you want without a doubt

[Chorus]

[Mashonda]
I know.... That we've....
Had our share of ups and downs but thats in the past
If you promise to hold me down
Then our love will have a second chance to last
I've been thinking of holding you
Showing you, what I'm all about
(And I promise) And I promise that I will do
Everything you want without a doubt

[Chorus]

[LL Cool J]
Forget the past
We like Bonnie and Clyde from now on
Back to back, through the ups and downs
Right or wrongs, lay down 
Let me kiss you all down your back
Then I'll go further down, swirl my tongue around
I apologize too 
For not recognizing the pain inside of you
I never lie to you, again
Last time had stress on my mind
Had a hard time believing 
That my girl could be genuine
It's different now, we ghetto lovers fo' real
I grab the wheel, you hold the steel
Teach me how to touch you where you like it the most
From now on, til we give up the ghost
Reunited, Baby

[Chorus - till fade]</pre>
