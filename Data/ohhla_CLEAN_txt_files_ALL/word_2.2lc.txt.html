Verse 1
[BM]  The party people love it when we take the stand
         With possessions of the mics in our hands
         'Cause when we rock a party we'll rock it forever
         We'll give you our best to make you dance better 
         The freshest rhymes you know we'll say
         We'll have you all stunned and in a daze
         We're qualified and certified
         To rock this party, so come alive!
         And we're here to be known and we're known to be
[FKI]  As the Fresh Kid Ice
[BM]  And the Brother Marquis         
         And we're together forever, lookin' out for one another
[TO]  Stayin' thicker than thick than peanut butter!
[BM]  But don't forget our DJ, with all the skill
         Go off, Mr. Mixx - 
[TO]  SCRATCH AT WILL!!

(Mixx cuts "We will, we will rock you!")

Verse 2
[BM]  You can analyze and study me until a break-through
         A discovery will be made like the scientists do
         What will be discovered and finally uncovered
         Will be none other than Marquis, your brother
         There will be no difficulty; all your problems will be solved
         You'll become motivated, so get involved!
         My introduction has a body and a conclusion
         I hope you understand so there is no confusion
         Just follow the directions of the daily lesson
         While me, the professor, is professin'
         To the simplest form I'll keep my rhymes in perspective
         So, Kid Ice, take the mic and give the people some directive!
[FKI]  Rhymes are something you must comprehend
         And every time that I rhyme I will always ascend
         Two levels, just like no man before me
         My skills and talents I will prove to thee
         That Kid Ice uses lyrics as believin' in rhyme
         And in every rhyme, I will show you a sign  
         Of the times where my music is growin'
         And the power of my fans will be showin'
         In everything that I say and everything that I do
         And to the people, I'll always be true
         So step off the stage, give us the mike
         So we can rock the people the way you would like
[TO]  'Cause we're the two MC's with all the skill         
         We're down by law, and we know the deal
         There's only one thing we do, and we do it right
         And that's rockin' party people with these here mics!</pre>
