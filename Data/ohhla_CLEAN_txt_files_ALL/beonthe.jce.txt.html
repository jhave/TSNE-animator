Be on the lookout for J-U
Cause niggaz'll do what we do
Believe me I'm watching you too
So be on the lookout for J-U
Be on the lookout for J-U
Cause niggaz'll do what we do
Believe me I'm watching you too
So be on the lookout for J-U (you)

[verse1]
Mr. Double-murder-on-loose-leaf, hey life happens
Mr. News-brief, Mr. Front-I-might-cap-him (Shit!)
Mr. Impolite, snap and represent the right rapping
Mr. White-folks-pimp-the-mic-laughing
Mr. Wear-the-right-fashion, Mr. Typecastic
Mr. Saw-your-soundscan-but-breezed-right-passed-it
Mr. Bozack, Mr. Crip-the-night-acid
Mr. Don't-step-until-you-get-your-life-mastered
Mr. Get-the-girl-probably-twist-a-dyke-backwards
Mr. Rent-the-suits-but-whole-sales-to-white-caskets
Label exec's, Mr. Major-respect
I perfected the art of rapping, shit the tables is next
Mr. Indy-rap, the big labels is vexed
Mr. Illinois-where-niggaz-like-to-play-with-the-techs
Mr. Thick-chain, Ya, I know the cable is fresh
But if you reach, I'm Mr. Motherfucking-lay-you-to-rest

So be on the lookout for J-U (you)
