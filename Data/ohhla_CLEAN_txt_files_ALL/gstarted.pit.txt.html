Song:   Get It Started
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

To these rappers I apologize, I know it ain't fair
Only ball I drop, New Year's Times Square
The world is mine, sixth sense, I see the seventh sense
Now baby, let's get started for life

Every time I look into your eyes
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime
We can get started for life (tonight)
For life (tonight) for life (tonight)
We can get started for life (tonight)
For life (tonight) for life (tonight)
We can get started

[Beat break]

(You know it feels right)

Big news, Pitbull, Tom Cruise, Mumbai
A lit up their December night like the fourth of july, vanilla sky
Thriller in Manila, knocking them out like Pacquiao
No Ali, no Frasier, but for now it's off to Malaysia

Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day
Now that's worldwide, if you think it's a game, let's play, dale

Every time I look into your eyes
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime
We can get started for life (tonight)
For life (tonight) for life (tonight)
We can get started for life (tonight)
For life (tonight) for life (tonight)
We can get started

[Beat break]

(You know it feels right)

I am what they thought I'd never become
I believed and became it
Now I'm here to claim it
I hustle anything you name it, name it
I went from eviction to food stamps
To bagging work, wet &amp; damp
To a passport flooded with stamps
Now it's Volì everywhere I land

Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day
Now that's worldwide, if you think it's a game, let's play, dale

Cause if it feels right (you know it feels right)
We shouldn't waste anymore time
Let's get it started (let's get it started)
Don't think about it (let's get it started)
You know I'm gonna make it alright, alright (let's go)

Cause if it feels right (you know it feels right)
You know I made up my mind
Let's get it started (let's get it started)
Don't think about it (let's get it started)
I know that we can make it alright, alright

Every time I look into your eyes
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime
We can get started for life (tonight)
For life (tonight) for life (tonight)
We can get started for life (tonight)
For life (tonight) for life (tonight)
We can get started

(Don't start what you can't finish)

[Beat break]

(You know it feels right, let's go, you know it feels right)</pre>
