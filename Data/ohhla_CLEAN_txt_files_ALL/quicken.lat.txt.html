[Lateef]
Solesides
Alright, alright, alright
Let's get one thing clear right now
Lot of emcees out here claiming that they got styles
And that they tight, huh
But I don't give a damn about none of them
Cause, see me

[Verse One]
See, I'm gon' be alright, live my life as long as I'm alive
I ride on five-eighty, but I'm not an eighty-fiver
Usually exit high enough to fly like Egyptian gliders
Bringing the message to the black man like Elijah
Honourable, did I mention, ain't no dissent amongst the strivers
No tension or fights, there just be lessons in life
I'm a subscriber to the Call that's Final
Fiend for the knowledge like my DJ fiends for vinyl
Hold the microphone like a habitual user, like winos
Clutch wine bottles, in my death grotto
Until my skin gets mottled, don't expect to get coddled
Cause see me, patna
I wasn't raised in no family that got up to pops reading stocks
It was more like he was down the block
At my uncles' rolling up chops, getting off knocks
Had the whole damn neighbourhood on lock
Back before the game was hard like rocks
Yet lightweight like glocks, and this shit don't stop
It's as frightening as the idea of a million black men
Marching on Washington might have been to some people
But then only if we're not equal
As shoulders get colder, individuals get older and bolder
I ain't buying what they sold ya, I'm a soldier
The Warriors first round number one pick like Joe Smith
Thought I told ya
I ain't average, I manage to move my mandible rapidly to scold ya
Got a powerful role as flamby as the average nigga's plan B
Ought to be running shit in 96 ala Marcus Camby
Can be, can he do it? All night until the early morning
Break of dawn light, I flow like fluid out your spigot
Rough and wicked when I kick it

[Hook]
Yes, righteous and I might just never even quit
Because it's only to the will of Allah that I submit
Righteous and I might just never ever quit
Because it's only to the will of Jah that I submit like that

[Verse Two]
The name's Lateef and if you've got beef
You'll get cut up by the butcher's cut, see
I'll sink my teeth into your neck like a mastiff
Fool, you're weak, I got five on your cheek
I'll crash the boards and glass, slam that ass as fast
As Shareef-Abdul Raheem, clean the glass
I'mma school that, degrees that keep the shitstem up
Victims for pickings, royal stickings, stick with poli-tricks
And politicians acting like they on a hell-bent mission
For the annihilation and decimation of the human nation
Brother, listen cause they're testing my faith
What I'm feeling is the wreckoning, the quickening
Expression of the manifestation of victory
Regardless of societies that sneak around in secrecy
You see ­ it gets deep, deep as history
Creeps like time since 4000 BC, it's not a mystery
Lord knows, revealed to my soul and it shows
I drop flows that'll rock past the 21st century
They trying to keep it real, but compared to what
When there ain't even no backing to their passing buck
When you shift from the material shit they get stuck
Trip, they gone slip, they're up the creek, in the clutch
All because they really just don't give a fuck

[Hook]
Yet I'm righteous and I might just never even quit
Because it's only to the will of Allah that I submit
Righteous and I might just never ever quit
Because it's only to the will of Jah that I submit like that</pre>
