{*sample from the movie "They Live"*}
Thought you boys understood it's business? That's all it is
You still don't get it, do you boys? No more good guys!
They're running the whole show, they own everything
The whole damn planet, they can do whatever they want!
What's wrong with having it good for a change?
And they're gonna let us have it good if we just help 'em
They're gonna leave us alone! Let us make some money!
You can have a little taste of that good life too
Now I know you want it, hell everybody does
You'd do it to your own kind
What's the threat? We all sell out everyday
Might as well be on the winnin team!

[Decompoze]
Yo, this is Decompoze, and I gotta say
we need to try to keep this music to ourselves
We sellin out this art, for some money
to a guy who don't care nothin about this music
We gotta keep it to ourselves, tryin to win the Indy 500
Like this, check it out, check it out, check it out

[Chorus] - 2x
All we need is beats and rhymes to go and spark it
As long we got the underground, yo we got a market
I don't need a major to tell me how to run it
Cause my goal's to win the Indy 500

[Decompoze]
Start your engines, mo' pole positions got me sittin
In the fifth row, you only go if your gassed like Citco
And since my, terrorist, car's brand new
My pit crew consists of me, and the Binary too
For your car, you got the luxuries of a star
You got a crew of two dozen plus an A&amp;R
That's your axle and your ratchet man
Cause after he get rich, man
you skit out on the ditch and be abandoned, need refixin
You also got the pressure, first to second no lesser
If you don't, you think you'll drive again, you'd never
See, it's not about the car it's the way you drivin it
If you cats is lame, can't maintain than you won't survive in it
I'm revivin it, the record wreckage I steer though
Comin from behind, unseen by rear view
You sleep in your seat, don't even know what's the deal
No suggestions on directions, they're controllin your wheel
And if you ever finish first a platinum trophy is risen
Your prize money?  Your staff of 2 dozen got dibs in 
Know the cars, know the race, cause if you get outsmarted
It doesn't matter where you finish, you'll end up where you started

[Chorus] - 2x

[Hook]
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win, my goal's to win, my goal's to win

[Decompoze]
It's the battle of Dave and Goliath, the big and small
We need to take control of this shit, and get it all
Expect these rec' execs to take a fall
I came to collect my checks and that's my call
Don't confuse it, they pay your dumb ass, to abuse it
To get rich they use it, then they call it nigga music
You lose it, you're sold for some crumbs and promo
But if you really want the dough bro, you would go solo
You put food on your table playin the game wrong
While you dialing that fast food, they eat filet mignon
They applied the pressure, so you gave 'em a song
And if that shit don't hit, the next day you're gone
My copyrights are exclusive, for my uses
They make you a public nuisance, every unit you get two cents
I got influenced, the underground, the X factor
Record deals' slavery, so when you sign say, "Yes master"

[Chorus] - repeat 2x

[Hook] - repeat 2x

[Chorus]
