Wooh
Come on
Wooh
Uh, uh, wooh
Come on
Wooh

Uh, uh uh
Man, I hear you niggas talkin
But'choo walkin the wrong way to really mean it
I done heard it, I done seen it, don't get caught up in between it
Its a dark road you walkin on, same street that I be stalkin on
Suppose to be quiet, but you keep talkin on
Now ya mouth got you in some shit
So we gon' let everybody see your gangsta ass get smaked like a bitch
Guess I'll remind y'all niggas, I can find y'all niggas
Click click, whats up, walk up right behind y'all niggas
Once the four four hit'cha
You ain't going no where but out the door on a stretcha
Boy, I'ma get'cha
Wet y'all niggas up like a pool
'Cuz I done told you, Y'ALL GON' MAKE ME LOSE MY COOL
Yo Knock get the glock, these bitch niggas is actin
Making movies, we'll make a movie about this shit after is happened
All that yappin, that them niggas is gettin away with
Take it easy my friend, let 'em know, dog ain't to be played with

Chorus: DMX

A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad
cause it'd take a lot of pressure of my back
A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad
cause it'd take a lot of pressure of my back

[DMX]
Uh, uh, uh
Most of these hard rocks turn out to be soft as wet dog shit
Talkin shit, but when the fog spits, dog they all split
Then all hit the ground around the same time
In the same frame of mind, ?thangs up in the nine? 
left them bitches blind, hit 'em up from behind
Yeah, thats how you do that
And he had such a good head up on his shoulders, but I blew that
Fuck you black, you new cats don't know somethin important
You die quick fuckin with my shit, and my shits extortin
House rules, when I speak, y'all niggas listen
I drop jewels that y'all cats can't afford to keep missin
Triggered by stress, fueled by drugs
Shits about to get real outta hand dog, betta get ya man dog
Rap shit comes second, I'ma show you what a robber do
Mention ice one more time and I'm robbin you
Tie you up for a week starvin you
Beatin the shit outta you everday, cuz yo, these niggas gotta pay

Chorus

[DMX]
Uh, uh, uh
Dog it ain't no secret 'bout how its going down once I put on the pressure
It ain't nothing but another nigga put on a stretcher
With a blanket over his face, take him to the morgue with the waste
'Cuz he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
So I gave it to him in his chest
In his throat, in his head, in his back, through his vest, YES
Ain't a whole lot to braking a nigga down fast
They call me black 'cuz thats how I'm gon' be on that ass
Y'all pussy niggas think y'all sweet
But ain't a fuckin thing going down til I eat
So can I beef? You betta while you still got teeth
'Cuz they about to get knocked out, hopped out
On that ass with a blast that'll make ya shit drop out
Popped out, through a you know what
Cuz you know why, and you know my
Motherfuckin name up in this game
And bitch, you know I
Will never be crossed flippin, but on some east coast terms
New York niggas do, fuck the perms
