Talk:  I don't believe this shit here man
	   Y'all niggas is fucked up, word up
	    It's aight though, Imma get to the bottom of this shit
	    Check it

L.:  Yo what the fuck is
	I go uptown to collect these checks
	Come back to find my man body in blood, shit stretched
	Across the pavement 
	I know one of y'all know some information
	So Imma get down to the bottom of this whole situation
	Who shot the LR?  Was it you, Rock?
Rock:  Don't look at me, Oc!
	I don't believe you think I
	Shoot niggas on my team
	We grew up on the same block
	Set up weed spots together
	Stacked a good amount of cheddar
	Cracked a few brews, so never would I do that to my reverend 
	This crime, nobody witnessed?
L.:  Rock, my only lead is this photo if him kissin this mistress
	That I found at the scene
Rock:  Hold up, she used to live around my way
	Yo, shit is fucked up
	I think I need a drink, pass the Cavasiaa
L.:  Aight, I hear you kid
	But if you didn't, nigga who did?
	This bullshit, I ain't buyin it
	Mr. Lee?
Mr. Lee:  Don't even try it son
	My life is private
	I handles my B-I, then I'm slidin
	Fuck it if it ain't about some real estate and what I'm drivin
	Get the picture?
	No time to get caught in the mixture
	Plus I was winnin with the 
	LR in a joint venture
	I know you feel that
	Money's the motive nigga
	But I'm coming out of fiscal year with my
	Number seven figures

Chorus:  Well, Goddamn that niggas layin up in ICU
	Shot the fuck up and nobody got a clue
	That's some bullshit for real
	Son was set up and yall won't say who
	Somebody knows and yo, I think I got a clue

L.:  So niggas what's the deal yall
	Somebody squeal or Imma fuck around and kill all
	That fall just for frontin
 	Cuz somebody know sumthin
	Yo, Tray, I think it's you
	You never showed love for my brother son
	I should pop that ass now you pretty motherfucker
Tray:  Aight, you right, shit is true, I never really liked that nigga but
	Despite my personal views I'd never snipe the nigga
	Fuck a oozy
	When I'm layin in Jacuzzis
	Sippin on Don P, slayin a don piece
	Chillin, makin movies which reminds me
	Sis in the picture, I used to hit that
	But, correct me if I'm wrong, I coulda sworn I seen you wit that
	Plus, yall never got along and you accuse me, wait a second yo
	My question is what's wit the leather gloves and why you sweatin?
L.:  What, are you suggestin
	That I put one in my flesh and
	Blood?
Tray:  Coulda been done
Rock:  Yeah, civil of the good son when the good one almost caught it
L.:  Yo, Rock, don't even take it further
	Cuz you was the last nigga wit him
	Huh, did you attempt the murder?
	Y'all was supposed to come together
Rock:  Right, and we was on the way but then son had to make a run
	Hold up dog, what are you sayin?
L.:  That you're to blame, the last to arrive, the rest of us was early
Mr. Lee:  Aight so just what time did you get here
L.:  What, about 7, 7:30?
Mr. Lee:  Fuck that you left for a second nigga
L.:  Nigga you know what, niggas is funny
	Rock, that nigga drank your liquor
	Mr. Lee, he owes you money
	But yall look at me like I'm guilty
	I find that hard believin 
	When my case and point is I'm the only one without a reason  

Chorus

L.:  Check it out, we all agree that he was the nicest MC
All:  True dat, for real, aight
Mr. Lee:  But, L., you looked at him wit envy
L.:  Yo that's my brother, not me
	I beg to differ
Mr. Lee:  Aight then let's get back to this picture
L.:  Yo what about it
Mr. Lee:  Niggas know you used to dig her
L.:  She got a fat ass but I doubt it
Tray:  Oh yeah she got a fat ass
Mr. Lee:  You, hold up Tray, he's killin me
	L. used to hit it B
	Before he went away to DC
	That's right, remember that?
	So all this doubt shit, yo I ain't feelin that
	And it got you heated when you found out LR was killin that
L.:  Yo you still on that?
Mr. Lee:  Yeah I'm still on that and I would let it pass
	But you the only nigga wit gloves and a mask, dumb ass!
	Blood splashed from sole to sole
	Now you lookin petro
	Caught you plottin from the get-go
	But son ain't dead, though
L.:  Goddammit I knew it this . 38 special is bullshit and played
	Next time I'm blazin niggas wit the 12 gauge
	I had it made, was on my way to LA 
	To lay low, nigga 
	And stay to' 
	Up off the Hennesy
	Fuck memories, yo we was enemies
	And shit you didn't see, since we was young yo son was testin me
	I let it get the best of me
Tray:  It's jealousy!
L.:  Yeah, yeah whateva B.
	Yo, I admit that
	I used to love her and I smacked it
	But I'll be damned if Imma let that nigga crack it
