[Intro - Fabolous]
I wanna be your number 1 fan, but from the stage
Know it's hard to see way up in the stands

I understand, but damn [x2]

Wishing I could be that one man, but you juggle
Way too many of them with one hand

I understand, but damn [x2]

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Yea, Slow down baby, let me be your yellow light
The way we met was wrong, let me say hello right
You need a mellow night, a break from this ghetto life
The way I roll make them haters wanna yellow dice
She say what matters is that you keep them stilettos nice
And when you slap this ass, it shake like Jello, right?
Well alright, roll them cigarellos tight
I nicknamed her bape chicken and yellow rice
Pretty brown skin, long blonde hair
And she know they talking but she never gon' care
Cause when you balling trash-talk is what you gon' hear
I can't imagine what a fall upon LeBron's ear
Always been the girl that didn't have to wait in line
Niggas buy her watches just for making time
Fake say "give it up" never had to ask
They call her the stick up girl that never wore a mask
Baby, ain't you tired of life in this fast lane?
Packing luggage, rushing, trying to catch that last plane?
There's some dudes who take pride in trying to gas dames
The same dudes will see her and give they last name
Funny how I became the apple of her eye
The game went South and I'm a rapper from NY
Don't get me wrong: lil mama love "Trap or Die"
But through it all she kept her watch on the dapper guy
And fell in love with a 2009 verse
She said before we met, I fucked her in her mind first
We crossed paths, a mixture of karma and luck
I walked in strong, mentally palming my nuts
I got em swarming and stuck, she calm in the cut
You know me? I can spot a Swan from a Duck
My approach? Smoother than an Armani tux
The diamonds going off, like the alarm on a truck
The small talk, warming her up, she palming her cup
She told me that I make her laugh and I'm charming as fuck
But for now she had to go, the chat just quickly changed
She was chilling, now she leaving, I mean that was kinda strange
Asked "can we meet again?" She said "that can be arranged"
And I'm sure we both have phone numbers that can be exchanged
We did, she slid, that'd a be explained
But for now she hopped into a Platinum-colored Range

[Trey Songz]
See baby, see you gotta get ur mind right while there's still time left
You know life, wanting VIP sections and flight confirmations
Jumpin start to star, got ur own constellation
I aint tryna say dat u, shit, maybe I am
Never follow ur heart
Sure to lose your mindif u neva follow ur heart..

[Bridge]
You need to Slow down(Yes baby u need to slow down) [x2]
Slow Down.
You need to Slow down
You need to Slow You need to Slow You need to Slow Down
You need to Slow
Baby for real You need to Slow it onSlow it on Down</pre>
