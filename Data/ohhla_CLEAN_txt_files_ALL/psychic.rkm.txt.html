[Intro]
Uhh
{*female harmonizing "da da da" etc.*}
Uhh, like the way it's goin doin ma
Yo

[Rakim]
She got the, type of love that entice a thug
A tender mami, but sometimes she like it rough
See shorty way of thinkin is we might split up
So when she think it's gettin cool then she spice it up
She give me fever; give her chill bumps when I caress her
All night she never lets up, love it when she gets up
Mornin turn to night again, multiple, pleasure
She love playin new games and love playin dress up
Role playin rendezvous in secluded spots
Sex in the city with views from the rooftop
Find a cool spot stop, christenin the new drop
Ice can't keep your temperature down; you too hot
We do the craziest thangs and lay in the Range
Sex drive's out of control she can't stay in her lane
She said it turn her on when I'm sayin her name
So don't stop ma I'm playin your game - should I tell her?

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I like it love, you know just what I want
You know just what to flaunt you got the psychic love
Type of love make a thug wanna wife it up
When papi play it cool she seek to spice it up

[Rakim]
We havin fun now; feelin and diggin hon's style
She creative - let her imaginations run wild
Put me on, make sure I come back for more
She like "Damn boo, I never done that before"
She wearin outfits and lingerie and appear sweeter
The stewardess suit, the NBA cheerleader
Personal secretary night workin type skirts
The live-in maid or my favorite, the night nurse (I like that)
She take me out to public spots and get smoochy
Sex in the restaurant that sound gooshy
Sneak me in the cinema she said she wanna do me
as they play the Saturday matinee movie
The broad play right, quiet spot in the park
Broad daylight, sex is what she call play fight
And I'll be ready, whenever she put it on me again
The object is she want me to win - should I tell her?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah
Aiyyo Nick Wiz just
Just let it ride out
Y'knahmean?
Just let it go from there man
While my mami sit back
Let your hair down, let's go
Uhh, uhh, yeah</pre>
