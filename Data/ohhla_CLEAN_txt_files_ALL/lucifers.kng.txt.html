I was once a pretty angel, I once stood by you
I always did good by you
My wings were whiter than snow, you loved me so
But when I started a war, you banished my soul
You could never be your One, I was jealous of your son
I broke my halo, my horns have begun
To grow out of my head
Thy will has been done
In here I am God, but I miss my Father

Please just let me live again (I miss my Father)
I promise I will never sin (I miss my Father)
Please let me awake again (I miss my Father)
I'll praise You til the very end (I miss my Father)

Brimstone is what surrounds me now
Demons making awful sounds
This aint the place to go
Why cant I go back home?
Instead, hell, I guess I'll roam
I made the bed I must lie on
The prettiest angel heaven knows
In here I am God, but I miss my Father

Please just let me live again (I miss my Father)
I promise I will never sin (I miss my Father)
Please let me awake again (I miss my Father)
I'll praise You til the very end (I miss my Father)

Please God forgive me for my sins
I wish I was by your side again
Before the world comes to an end
I wanna look inot Your eyes again
Please God forgive me for my sins
I wish I was by your side again
Before the world comes to an end
In here I am God, but I miss my Father

Please just let me live again (I miss my Father)
I promise I will never sin (I miss my Father)
Please let me awake again (I miss my Father)
I'll praise You til the very end (I miss my Father)</pre>
