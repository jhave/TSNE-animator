[Suga Free]
Dollar bill y'all
Shit
Somethin' I can feel, y'all
Why you bullshittin'
Shadow on the 619

[Verse 1: Suga Free]
Oh, here motherfucker, since you wanna go fetch
On my worst day, you couldn't fuck with me at your best
I know you hate it when I show up (Show up)
Tow up
Probably cause you know I break a bitch and I'm about to blow up
Now it's hoe season
Motherfuckin' so why bitch
That you hatin' and contemplatin' on a real pimp for no apparent reason
That I beat the situation and I'm hot
Recognized that you hatin', cause I got them trick waitin'
Back to back, fuck a 'Llac
And a rat, like that
Oh, you fuckin' with a pimp
And you will get slapped
That's what a pimp do
Break you
And get rid of you
And make you tell 'em other players what I did to you
You bitch, you hoe, you slut
Better recognize game before I fuck you up
Now what you waitin' for?
I'll let a bitch pimp me when pushed
You don't sell no more and make dildos out of playdough

Chorus: Suga Free
If, you, don't
Leave me, alone
I'm, gone
Lock you in that little bitty box again, bitch
If, you, don't
Leave me, alone
I'm, gone
Lock you in that, lock you in that (Little bitty box again, bitch)
Little bitty box again

[Verse 2: 40 Glocc]
I had a bad ass bitch with a caramel tone
So I put my back in my bone, and mack in my tone
Told her, "Shut the fuck up," and sit in the back of the broom
Snatch my cheese up quick and kick the back with a shroom
Cause we don't love them hoes and
A bitch ain't worth a shit with no gold
So I hit the club to cop more
Y'all know
It's Suga Free and 40 Glocc in Dego
With Mr. Shadow all the way from Colton to Seattle
And back to Pomona
Hoes to promote the corner
Hit me on my two-way Motorola
I got a whole lot of soldiers that love to throw boulders
It's all over, test the faith and bleed slower
The heat Blaze Just that fast, give me Hovah
I want the cash and the ice and the keys to the Rover
Tricky gotta kick cheese to meet, nigga, to ball, blow up
Biotch

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Mr. Shadow]
I said, "She's A Hoe
Her friend's a hoe"
If you ain't about trickin', then your ass gotta go
From the open toe pumps to the way that you move
I'm a show you how a ese from the S.D. do
Straight act a fool, got you making me loot
Got you standing on the corner and that ass look cute
And you know when the fuck I'm comin' 'round the block
With the homey So G, Suga Free and 40 Glocc
It don't stop, we stay pimpin'
Bitch, why you trippin'
Don't hate the playa, hate the game
You damn chicken
Stickin', no lickin'
That's the motto
And boy, the life I life
Is hard to swallow
Make your shit hollow, real quick, don't try to follow
So pimp playa, pit bosses smokin' in a hot model
Don Shadow, makin' ya bitch clip tricks
She employee of the month when it comes to servin' dicks
Ha ha

Repeat Chorus</pre>
