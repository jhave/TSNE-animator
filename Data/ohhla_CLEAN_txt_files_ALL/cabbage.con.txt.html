[Talking]
Whats Happenin the grawl nitty camped out nigga
The halocaust in 98 playa
We the sickess all the time on the grind
All they got to do is say when nigga
If you in the way you just gone get rolled on believe that
You think I'm playin with you let me show u something

[C-Loc]
Where its at nigga, where its at nigga
Where the dope at nigga with my mug on 
Concentration camp savage bout his cabbage in the war zone
Down to break a jaw bone you hustlers know that sound
Central booking for fucking 'round whoa now
In a city where black folks wanna holla
Cause the white folks don't wanna see a nigga with a dollar
But we still on the highway trying to get the dope back by friday
Can careless 'bout what the fucking feds say

[Lay Lo 1]
Camp affiliated so start antiating gats nigga
Plated or black nigga
Aint taking no more stacks bitch
We breaking your back
I'm making your scrash for me
We say its simple and plan cuz thats the way it has to be
I grab my thang and blast for you, you grab your shit and blast for me
And we get mixed up in some mess we cause catasterfee
A nigga can't get mad at you if he don't get mad at me
Now we passing the microphone like we used to pass the weed

[Lay Lo 2]
Aight nigga we got business to attend to as a bitches gone surrender
Country side gangster shit nigga, and we weigh cigars
Me and my nigga chopping streets like a butcher
With thangs in seat cushions 
Fuck a ghetto rap pushers
We beefing with haters and tryin to come up off of these sacks
Gave up my everyday nina fina for these raps
And if these tracks, don't get my shit on swole
I ain't got nothin to loose, nigga we ready to fold

[Chorus- Young Bleed]  x 2
You do it savage nigga
You 'bout that cabbage nigga
Fuck, you gotta have it nigga
Addition to the habbit nigga
Want it better grab it nigga
Adjust to livin lavage nigga
Hustlin just a habbit and keep it hopin like a rabitt nigga

[Lucky Knuckles]
Let me know if ya ready
To show I'm down for confedi
Ain't got no time for the fake niggas sippin hot ones in they belly
This shit gets heavy for me, tru playas hustle for cheese
Respect the young nigga mind I'm only out to get me
I ain't got time for that bull-shit, frontin you get dunked on
I live by the streets, never leave my home, without my crome (Nigga)
[Young Bleed]
So what you wanna do with a ill matic, phyco-patic
Nappy nigga causin static
I hope you ready for steady stackin fedi, cause it don't stop with me
Everytime I doubt on my dough somebody (bitches) watchin me
I play it like it gotta be
Mashin in a high phillosophy
Runnin in it get it hollin' what u got for me, (Nigga)

[C-loc]
Fuck that frontin bitch I feel like killing something
Something ain't my thing so I'm a bang if I hear' em mumble
Bumble like a baby known to beat a bitch to death
Or grab them things and make' em range on the last nigga left
Dear God up in heaven, why must I all ways think of 211s
And 187s please help this felon
Makes his way back to the spot without gettin popped
Or snatched up out local cots and doing life like my pops

[Boo the Boss Playa]
Nigga, how you gettin your money, huh, slow or fast
I got 160 on the dash
500 on the ass, S class
Fuckin 'round with them hood rat tramps
Tryin to lead them hoes back to the camp, (so i can set it out for sho)
If you a freak bitch, then let it out
All my playa partnas don't mind, throwing up in your mouth
You see that arrow pointed towards the bottom, we call it the south
4 silly birds 500 an ounce

[Leetyme]
Drop the chesse in the cage with 30 hungry gorillas
Who the last to snatch, who you callin a killa
The smell of blood of my enemy make my dick like stone
Wanna leave him dying alone then jackin off with his own
Look at me my back by the wounds of your whip
Look at me I'm spyin on the woman you split
And these niggas so trippin, so busy playa hatin me
When them folks done gripped and got your mammy in the streets

[Chorus]  x 2
