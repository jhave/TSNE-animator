Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We were born to
Break the doors down
Fight until the end
It's something that's
Inside of us, it's how
We've always been, yeah

Warrior, -ior, -ior
Warrior, -ior!
Warrior, -ior, -ior
Warrior, -ior, ow!

We are the misfits
We are the bad kids
We degenerates
We ain't perfect
But that's alright

Love us or hate us
Nothin' can break us
Better believe us
Times, they are
A-changing tonight

We don't want to
Flirt with disaster
On your ass we'll
Pounce like a panther
Cut the bullshit
Out with a dagger
With a dagger
With a dagger

Do or die we all
Gonna stay young
Shoot the lights out
Like a machine gun
Think it's time for
A revolution
Revolution
Revolution

We were born to
Break the doors down
Fight until the end, yeah
It's something that's
Inside of us, it's how
We've always been, yeah

Warrior, -ior, -ior
Warrior, -ior!
Warrior, -ior, -ior
Warrior, -ior, ow!

Now this is our time
Our generation
And we're impatient
Animals you ready
To fight?

Fight for the fuck ups
Stand up for true love
We'll never give up
Live like it's our
Last night alive

We don't want to
Flirt with disaster
On your ass we'll
Pounce like a panther
Cut the bullshit
Out with a dagger
With a dagger
With a dagger

Do or die we all
Gonna stay young
Shoot the lights out
Like a machine gun
Think it's time for
A revolution
Revolution
Revolution

We were born to
Break the doors down
Fight until the end, yeah
It's something that's
Inside of us, it's how
We've always been, yeah

Warrior, -ior, -ior
Warrior, -ior!
Warrior, -ior, -ior
Warrior, -ior!

(Born to- -or)
(Huh, yeah, yeah)
(-Or, warrior, -ior)
(Yeah, yeah, -or)
(Huh, yeah)

We were born to
Break the doors down
Fight until the end, yeah
It's something that's
Inside of us, it's how
We've always been, yeah

Warrior, -ior, -ior
Warrior, -ior!
Warrior, -ior, -ior
Warrior, -ior!</pre>
