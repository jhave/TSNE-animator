F'real, uh...
Oh boy, due to the graphic game-orienfestedness
of this program, viewer discretion is advised
I promise you pimpin; I mean that there's so many L-R-P's
Lone Range Pimpin jumpin up on this track man you underdig?
We spit these L-R-P's and we do this damn thing real toughlike
You underdig?  So this a bitch, c'mon

[Nate Dogg]
The homies done made it, I'm so elated
Got all of the ladies, ohhhhh, nah nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Don't try to play me, just cause I'm faded
Don't think that I'm crazy, whoooh, nah nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
  
[E-40]
But Nate Dogg, what if my bankroll was to fall?
Think she'll cut from me, think she'll stand tall through it all?
Think she'll boost for me, steal me a pair
of dum-dum dum-dum's from the mall?  (Hell naw)
Bear it all, pose naked in the camasol (nah nah-nah-nah-nah-nah)
You got a baby by me, I got a baby by you
Whaddya mean?  I'ma always be able to plug you
You tell me to lick (lick) I tell you to suck (suck)
We be mad at each other, but we still WHAAAT?
  
[Nate Dogg]
I do what I wanna do, just cause I want to
Don't care too much about you, hell naw, nah nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nate Dogg ain't gon' force you, I'll wait until you want to
If not then I'll erase you, you know, nah nah-nah-nah-nah-nah

[E-40]
I left the club staggerin (staggerin)
Blasted handcuffed and lifted in the paddywagon
In a holdin cell, without a doubt
Your momma put her house up to bail me out
If that ain't stickin to the script
I'm her future son-in-law ain't never gave her no lip (lip)
Uhh, thought I wasn't (wasn't)
Love you cause you was down when I was scrubbin
  
[Nate Dogg]
Say you're lookin fo' a gangsta, girl I wanna thank ya
When niggaz come and question, do you know? Nah nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
While other niggaz thankin, corners I be bankin
Money I be makin, you know, nah nah-nah-nah-nah-nah

[E-40]
You was a, new comer, turned out by Barry White
GiGi Hana, mesmerized by my slang
I pop my collar one time (one time)
Got control of yo' mind (mind)
Never know, I'm sometimes in Kenneth Coles
Thugged out, never judge me by my clothes
When there's a drought, I be ridin, Z's and Vogues
Five times on the look out for the po'-po'

[Nate Dogg]
Nate D-O-double G (double G) Don't wanna fuck me (wanna fuck me)
As happy as can be (as can be) Nate Dogg and 40, Fonzarell'
