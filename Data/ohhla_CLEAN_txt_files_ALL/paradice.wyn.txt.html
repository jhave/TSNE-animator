[Verse One: Lil Wayne]
Moolah babe...
She was a young girl in pursuit of glory and fame
She would do anything she could to feel the flame
When everybody know your move and the things you pay
She finally made all her dreams come true and then she screamed
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
Oh no, this ain't paradise! (Yeahhh)
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
You know, this ain't paradise

[Verse Two: Lil Wayne]
He was a young boy in pursuit of money and fame-ahh
And he would do anything he could to kill the painnn-AHH
When everybody know your moves, they speak of your name
And ohh, all over the late night local news I heard him screammmm
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
Oh no, this ain't paradise! (Yeee)
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
Oh no, this ain't paradise

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
I say the sun don't shine forever (oh oh oh oh oh)
And everything that glitter ain't gold (ahhhhhhh)
I say love don't love forever (oh oh oh oh oh)
And everything that's new gets old (rahhhhh)

[Verse Three: Lil Wayne]
Sometimes we try to find
the road to the riches, need roadside assistance
Blisters on my knees, from beggin for forgiveness
Ain't no dollars on my trees, but knowledge on my feet
Cause I been climbin to the peak, and runnin from the bullshit
I'm tired of playin the same song, who told the DJ bring it back?
Dead Presidents, bullet in Abraham Lincoln hat
Starin at big poster I swear that he be winkin back
Cut school, sell crack, sorry I'm just thinkin back
Call-call me crazy I been called worse
It's like I have it all, but what's it all worth?
Ha ha, I'm probably better in my afterlife
I should cherish life but, this ain't paradise

[Outro]
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
Oh no, this ain't paradise! (Oh, ohh ohh ohh)
... this ain't paradise; no, this ain't paradise
This ain't paradiseeeeeeeee...</pre>
