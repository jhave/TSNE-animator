[Hook]
(Girls) Those that are bourgeois
Those that are hoochie
Those are usually in Gucci
(Girls) Some of them no good
Some of them so hood
But they all pros at you know what
(Girls) Local or overseas
They all go crazy over me
Don't matter what part of the world

Girls want to be part of my world

[Verse 1]
Look, I done had my share
Bringin' round me, is a bad idea
I take Big or small, short or tall
Light or dark, I try them all
Cuz I like
From stupido groupie hoes
To one of these r&amp;b group skio's
I need a slick mouth, thick south, brickhouse
Or I may date, a-rate playmate
Ten in the face, thin in the waist
Tight in the thighs, light in the eyes
Even those
Who think they the shit
I keep my
Walkin' on pedicured paws
Touchin' wit' manicured claws
If you waxed down, and tanned up
Then let me see ya hands up
Now

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I like my
In four inch Christian Laboutins
Lips made for kissin' and poutin' I like my
Fat butt, flat gut, and that strut. to drive cat nuts
I like my Gangsta pretty, stank saditty
No change, only got frank and fitty's
Them Natural born fraks, wit blonde streaks
Seven's on cheeks
My nothin'less than a dime piece
Pink face cartier time piece
I like my
Thug enough to cuss out cops
Wit' tits that'll bust out tops
I like my Classy and sassy
Still know how to be nasty
Like my
Wit' no laws, no flaws
No bra's and no drwaws'
Those yours

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
From the Asian to the Malaysian
I even had the Bahian to the Caucasian
I spend most the weekend
Wit' pretty Puerto and Costa Rican
Then again, I love Dominicians
And might be stylin' wit' a Italian
I be shakin for a Jamaican and Haitian
And take by the million if they they Brazilian
I'm sailin wit' a Australian
Or trafficin' wit' the south African
Panamian or Grenadian
You know I cross the border for a Canadian
I need a miss that's Swiss, a freak that's Greek
Or distinguished English
I fly in for a Hawaiian
And if you don't know who I am

[Hook]

[Outro]
