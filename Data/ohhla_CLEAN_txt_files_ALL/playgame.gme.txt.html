Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

You niggaz is soldiers man, fuckin toy soldiers
Yeah get in line cadet; atten-HUT!
Yayo you punk-ass bitch
I know you can't wait to get off house arrest nigga
So you can run the fuck outta New York, you faggot

[Chorus]
Niggaz love to play The Game, with 50 Cent, 50 Cent, 50 Cent
Why you tryin to play The Game, with 50 Cent, 50 Cent, 50 Cent
Can't play The Game with only 50 Cent, 50 Cent, 50 Cent
So why you tryin to play The Game with only 50 Cent
Come back when you got a couple dollars, holla

[Verse One]
You gon' need more than 50 Cent to play this Game
Nigga hatin on me cause I'm doin my own thang
I'm ain't Lloyd Banks bitch I don't share your brain
I was in the fast lane before the G-Unit chain
You was hatin on Ja cause him and Irv went pop
Now yo' ass run around singin the "Candy Shop"
After "Westside Story," I took your fans
I seen it for myself, that bitch Olivia's a man
I got word from the wise, nigga you dead wrong
Stole the real 50's name and wouldn't pay for his headstone
Nigga got mad when "How We Do" start climbin
Actin like a bitch cause he "Got Rich and Stopped Tryin'"
Got niggaz locked up, you a snitch in Queens
Told 'em Touch shot 'Pac then rated out Supreme
But on the rizzeal, I'm talkin about you and me
Toe to toe, five-oh-C-E-N-T, faggot

Banks is a bitch, 50 is a bitch
Yayo is a bitch, Buck is a bitch
Olivia's a bitch (Jersey Devil exclusive) no
Olivia's a man, ha ha, God damn

[Verse Two]
You reported more names than the evening news
I guess now Reebok makin cement shoes
Yayo the only real motherfucker from the street
You swingin on me like you want five heartbeats
Okay 1, 2, 3 4 flatline
If you say you wrote my shit one mo' time
You ain't a hood nigga you "Got Rich and Stopped Tryin'"
Jimmy scared Chris Lighty and Jay stop lyin
You a snitch, what'chu know about movin in silence
Even N.Y.P.D. can't deny it
The life of your story is fuckin Vivica
But your baby momma left you cause you couldn't get it up, bitch

Yayo went to jail, Banks sold a mill'
Then Buck sold a mill' then 50 gave a deal
to a bitch named Olivia who titties ain't real
Now they all hidin behind the police shield

[Chorus]

[Outro]
G-G-G-G-G-you niggaz ain't shit, bitch-ass niggaz
I told you this shit was real nigga
This is Fat Rat nigga, motherfucker
All you get up on there and sing a few hooks
Nigga and you wanna claim a nigga fame, nigga
You was Ashanti, you bitch-ass nigga, fuck is you talkin 'bout?
You wrote somethin nigga, the real is the real nigga
Black Wallstreet nigga, THE Black Wallstreet nigga
Gon' tell yo' bitch-ass nigga
I ain't gon' get up on this mic and play them games nigga
I told my nigga let me get that last 16 nigga
I'm rappin right now nigga, but I'm spittin the real nigga
You know who I'm talkin to nigga
50! Nigga, bitch-ass nigga
BLACK WALLSTREET NIGGA
Brazil and Wimelton, what block you on nigga?
We'll be there! What block you on?
Scary-ass nigga, fuck this shit man
Niggaz woke me up with that bullshit nigga</pre>
