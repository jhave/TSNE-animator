[David Banner]
No matter how hard it gets, you can make it
God loves you
I love you
We love you
We really do

You know, and uhm for me it ain't about nobody else
It's about me. You know
And if I have to do what's right for my spirit
And do what's right for God
And do what's right for these kids
And do what's right for my people, alone
Then this is what I gotta do

But I don't believe I have to
I believe the world is ready for it
