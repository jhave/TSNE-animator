Uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh..
Yeah yeah, here we go y'all
Here we here we here we go y'all
Busta Rhymes Flipmode y'all
Yeah yeah y'all
Extinction Level Event shit
Bomb threat to the whole world
What what what is goin on
What the fuck goin on here? Check it out yo

[Busta Rhymes]
Holy amazing grace about face
Total erase you niggaz off the face of the place
Such a shame I had to go grab my calico
Pass the dough 'fore you find out what I had to blast you fo'
Extreme laws for ones who did try to go against this
Wet your shit up like a sloppy tongue kiss
Wait! But wait! To you, who don't know what you talkin about
Without a doubt, where my live niggaz? Give me a shout!
Yo, yo-yo, yo, on the strength shit niggaz check fo'
Connect the four shots and guess who blew it from next door
BLING! Time after time we gon' shine again
Feel it like a broad getting fucked from behind again
Aiyyo - Aiyyo, I be the closest thing to the next
Like the pain and sufferin of about a million deaths
I'm only here to present, and bring the impact
of the Extinction Level Event - now sing the song of salvation

{Chorus sample: "Early in the Morning," Terry Baxter and His Orchestra}

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
  "La lah, la la lahhh la la"
What y'all gonna do? Where the fuck you gon' go? (Sing a song now)
  "La lah, la la lahhh la la"
The fuck y'all niggaz gon' run?
Where y'all niggaz think y'all runnin to son? (Sing a song now)
  "La lah, la la lahhh la la"
Bomb threat to the world!
The fuck goin on with niggaz out here? (What, sing a song now)
  "La lah, la la lahhh la la"
We are now approachin the dawn
of global emergency motherfuckers!

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo yo yo, disregard your whole assignment
Crooked ass nigga need some realignment - powerful refinement
Crazy shit I do make me wanna know where my mind went
Blackin out, buildin hostillity, gettin violent
Straight giving niggaz an ass-whippin on consignment
Then I bust your shit 'til the day of my whole retirement
Yo yo - shake it and rattle like we ready to battle
Fight seein at every angle like a motherfucking satellite
Quickly bust up your crotches and fuck up your process
Bounce in the night, leavin sayin "Adios" or even "Buenas noches"
Have y'all niggaz wildin havin a fit
Flame throwin lyrics like a bunch of blowtorches and shit
Grand spectacular, chainsaw massacre
Thug fanatic street shit that be on the creep comin after ya
Then we hit you with the most significant time bomb
Ready to designate at the slightest wave of a white arm
Best form of advice I could give is remain calm
The repercussion is somethin you could never imagine would be goin on
(HA!) Never believe in your eyes
When my Squad some through at an astronomically large size
Movin the mountains keepin all of my niggaz bouncin
Big up my bitches in the place who be screamin and shoutin
(HA!) I'm only here to present
And bring the impact of the Extinction Level Event
Sing the song of salvation

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
  "La lah, la la lahhh la la"
Once again, as we welcome all motherfuckers in the world
(Sing a song now)
  "La lah, la la lahhh la la"
To experience, the Extinction Level Event (sing a song now)
  "La lah, la la lahhh la la"
The dawn, of global emergency .. (sing a song now)
  "La lah, la la lahhh la la"
The moment where we all come together in one unison
and completely dominate, all global events (yo, sing a song now)
  "La lah, la la lahhh la la"
We about to completely destroy, all the whack bullshit
(Sing the song now)
  "La lah, la la lahhh la la"
That we got goin on, in our every, and any reach
(Aiyyo, yo, sing a song now)
  "La lah, la la lahhh la la"
All my live niggaz, all my live bitches, it's motherfucking on!
(Yo, sing the song now)
  "La lah, la la lahhh la la"
As we enter the new millenium, with this rap shit (Yo, sing a song now)
