Brooklyn New Yorker, street walker, slang talker
S-T-double-E-L-E the author
Stay in it to win in the ride with the windows tinted
Aromatic marijuana addict, ganja fanatic
Smoke on the black shit, maintain watch you actors overreactin
Packin but they slackin plus they lackin
direc-tion, thinkin that Smif-N-Wessun gon' protect em
in the sec-tion, smokin guns tear through your teflon
Before you get a chance to draw your wea-pon
my dogs get to wettin yo' street, like Johnny pumps
leavin lots of lumps cause lots of chumps, think they gettin past
But ain't no leeways, come back like DJ's, cut yo' shit
Leave you dizzy, watch me get bizz-ay, sideline niggaz 
askin is he, the one they came to see, S-T from Cocoa B's
Locally, I'm known for representin lovely vocally
Me and my P-N=C smoke thee

Yo if you're out to be the boss and floss (just do that)
Run up in clubs with big dogs (just do that)
If you have to let yours blast off (just do that)
To all my thorough cats (just do that)
and yo my puddy cats (just do that)
If you're out to be the boss and floss (just do that)
Run up in clubs with big dogs (just do that)
If you have to let yours blast off (just do that)
To all my thorough cats (just do that)
and yo my puddy cats (just do that)</pre>
