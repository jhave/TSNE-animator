[Beanie]
My Spidey Senses is tingling
Feel something God my radar is up

[Verse 1]
Something going on, I feel funny, can't tell me nothing's different
My nose twitchin, Intuition setting in like Sti Vision
I still close my eyes, I still see visions
Still hear that voice in the back of my mind
So what I do, I still take heat, I still listen
I still paint that perfect picture
I still shine bright like a prism
My words still skippin through air
I know you can't don't won't get it
You square chose to ride that shit, sault with it, I'm still afloat
I ain't the captain of the yacht but I'm on the boat
I ain't acting what I'm not knowing that I don't
You niggaz acting like you will but I know you won't
Man I read between the lines of the eyes of ya brows
Your handshake ain't matchin your smile

[Chorus]
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
(I don't know man, I just feel something)
I can hear it in your voice
(Something ain't right man)
I can feel it in the air

[Verse 2]
I sit alone on my floor in the room staring at hammers
Ready to go bananas, two vests on me
Two uzis, extra clips on me
I know my mind ain't playin tricks on me
I ain't schitz homie
Ain't nobody dropped a mick on me
Its like they trying to pop a sick on me
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like Mack, tighten up your circle
Before they hurt you, read they body language
85% communication non-verbal
85% swear they know you
10% you know they stories
Man the other 5, I'mma show you
Just know you been pulling strings
You the puppetmaster, Them other bastards
Now watch who you puffin after
Play your cards, go against all odds
Shoot for the moon, if you miss, you still amongst those stars

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Can you feel the grim reaper floatin?
Foul preachin quotin' scriptures from revelation
Talk shit and got devil waiting
Body getting stiff, soul levitation
Why do I speak blasphemy?
Knowing one day they will ask for me
Ask for my sins
No one will feel his wrath for me
I go through it so you wouldnt do it after me
As for me, I'm still circling the block before I'm parking
Not bitchin, I'm just still cautious
Same black parker
Same uzi, extra clip, still clappin wit that same larkin
Damn I feel an inner air you will not still here
There ain't an us or a we or I'm a thing
Its a good bad karma thing
Its a song and an honest thing
I swear I feel something honestly

[Chorus]</pre>
