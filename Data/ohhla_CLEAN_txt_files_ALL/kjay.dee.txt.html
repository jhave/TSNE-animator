Whattup, whattup, whattup, whattup? {*slower to faster*}

Ay it's time to, get that ninth caller
while we roll into this Jay Dee

R-r-r-r-real niggaz only...
Re-real niggaz only
R-r-r-r-real niggaz only {*echoes*}

Dedicate this to the "real niggaz only"
This is dedicated to...

Who keep the music... 
... the music, who can refuse it
Are you listening? What's my name?

"J Dilla" - Jay did it again
Oh! OHH! Oh! OHH!
Keep your hands up bitch
Yo YO yo YO yo YO yo YO...
Keep your hands up...

"I told y'all, here they come now! You see?"

"Yo check this out, it's the Choco Boy Wonder, Pete Rock"
"And you tuned into Jay Stay Paid"

JAY STAY PAID {*slowed*}

"The hottest hour in hip-hop, you know what it is"

JAY STAY PAID {*slowed*}</pre>
