Rock! Roll! Roll! Roll! Roll!
Well every time that you're allowed to see the morning sun
It's a reminder that your life ain't done
Wake Up and Live
Wake Up and Live RIGHT NOW

I keep believing I can fly find my reasons why
The only way you'll ever earn to die is if you live
You Got To Live RIGHT NOW

And don't you let nobody tell you what you can do
Ain't another minute promised to you
You Better Live
I Said Live RIGHT NOW

You got to cherish every moment, carelessness is a crime
Revelation gon' be right on time
You Better Live
You Better Live RIGHT NOW

Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir
LIVE! I Said Live RIGHT NOW
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir
LIVE! I Said Live RIGHT NOW

And to the hustlers grindin' on the block every day
I know sometimes it got to be that way
You Got To Live
You Got To Live RIGHT NOW

And every day is like a test you say you doing you best
And you see a nigga dying for less
Try To Live
Start Livin' RIGHT NOW

(Chorus)

And all that in and out of jail is getting old
Let this song here save your soul
Brother Live
Start Livin' RIGHT NOW

I bet you never thought you would hear it from me
But I done change from how I used to be
I Want To Live
I Want To Live RIGHT NOW

(Chorus)</pre>
