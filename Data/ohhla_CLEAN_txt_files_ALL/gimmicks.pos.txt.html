Song:   No Gimmicks
Typed by: hwarner967@hotmail.com

No major label power moves
No costumes
No broad on the album with a fat ass
No wardrobe malfunction
No power luncheons

This is it, no limits, no gimmicks

No slogans
No 20 inch rims rollin
No gold fronts
No publicity stunts
No make believe beef
No shoot-outs in the streets

This is it, no limits, no gimmicks

No MTV cribs, no crib at all
No outta shape fat boys telling you how to ball
No pimpin the ride, no ride to pimp

This is it, no limits, no gimmicks

No midgets on stage
No daytime play
No payin for a radio slot
No suckin up to the press just so they'll say this record's hot

I like how you blend in
Your music's so safe
Why go against the grain
when you can fit perfectly with everything today
Here, let me put you in a box
Bein independent must really suck
Is that all you really want?
It can't be enough to just do it for the love

No crunk music
No funk music
No contemporary hip-hop/jazz fusion
No collabels with wack people who feel what we do

And this is it, no limits, no gimmicks

No mix cds
No pornographic DVD's
No monkey see monkey do
No dick ridin other crews to get a W

This is it, no limits, no gimmicks

No overbearing hype man
No ghostwritin
No A&amp;R getting more shine than I am
No callin women bitches just to prove that I'm a man

This is it, no limits, no gimmicks

No throwback jersey hangin to my knees
No doo-rags
No white tees
Just the best producer and the best emcee

This is it, no limits, no gimmicks

I like how you blend in
Your music's so safe
Why go against the grain
when you can fit perfectly with everything today
Here, let me put you in a box
Bein independent must really suck
Is that all you really want?
It can't be enough to just do it for the love</pre>
