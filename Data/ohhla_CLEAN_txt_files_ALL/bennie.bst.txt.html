[Biz Markie]
Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That has known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh-ho
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe you're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

Say, Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh-ho
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Take it away...

Say, Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet
But they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh-ho
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets</pre>
