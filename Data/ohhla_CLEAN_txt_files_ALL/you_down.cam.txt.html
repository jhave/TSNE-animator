[Hook 2X: Hell Rell]
LOOK UP IN THE SKY, IT'S A BIRD IT'S A PLANE
AHHH NAAAH IT'S HELL RELL, HE SITTING ON TOP OF THE GAME...
I'M UP AND YOU DOWN
I'M UP AND YOU DOWN
I'M UP AND YOU DOWN
I'M UP AND YOU DOWN

[Hell Rell]
"They tryna say I'm dooooown, doooown"....
No nigga I'm uppity up, up in the truck
And I'm busting a dutch open, picture me rolling
These niggaz get up out my way, they see this ratchet I'm holding
Yeah and your career's up and down like a see-saw
Always talk about you fly, never been on a G4!
Lemme bring you to the crib where we stay at for the summer
It's a bar in the bathroom and our Butler got a butler
The carpet made of Mink, it's Marble in the sink
We concentrated on money, it's hard for you to think!
Tips on the ride, fifth on my side
Little niggaz look up to me like it's a blimp in the sky
Why? I don't know I guess they feeling my swagger
Like the way that I be clicking my clacker, whipping the batter
And gather 'round gun toters, you still shooting
Let off some shots to that Hell Rell music
Here's a couple of bars for your brain cause it's therapeutic
Cock .45, put ya hands high
I... Hell Reezy get rid of grams easy
Dress fly, shit on niggaz in Lamborghinis
The door's is up, and the whore's is sluts
Go crazy and we scoop all of em up
And I'ma have enough money where I can bathe in it
You can't walk in my shoes, our feet was made different!
