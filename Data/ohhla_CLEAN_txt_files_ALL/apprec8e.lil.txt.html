Yeah real shit, you nam saying, Bay Area boys stand up, man

Shit, this young nigga I be flowing precise

Dog I'm a dog watching over you mice
50 on the mic sixteens imma write
Dude you ain't a thug I ain't believing in that
The only time you seen crack is when you peeping at an ass
And I got a lot if hoes that's loving the boss
The only time you see pussy when you sleeping with cats
I said I'm on the rise, you feel me
Always sleep, you feel me, y'all yawning
Money on my mind get it for cheaper nigga
Keep talking and put yo ass in the sleeper nigga
You feel me put to ass in the bleachers nigga
Look at the wrist like a freezer
I'm the rawest in the game, I'm worth more money so I stopped buying chains

Fuck it, you nam saying, I'm just the realest tnigga alive

Get that nigga make him feel the real
You gon' see this bitch
I'm pissed off, I ain't got no money in a week

Hittas on the left side
Old school ride dirty
Everyday I fucking ride dirty
Still thinking Imma split a nigga wig
I'm rapping and I'm looking like a business man
That's good, might god
For my scraping shit, I was facing 36
Nigga would have took the case, but fuck it
I know I did it
I ain't got no money for lawyers
Real street nigga, no money, all real
Slap you in the fucking face for the money
It's real deal, use my brain cause my brain is power
Let me take a shower

You know but always, I always use non-violent
