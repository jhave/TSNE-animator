[ Intro ]
Represent, you act like this was the first time we done had to tell y'all
You can hear us though, you can hear us... in 4, 3, 2, 1

( Verse 1 )
I was born a bastard, my mama was a baby
And she didn't have the skills it would ever take to raise me
Pops jumped ship and left us doin bad
I pretty much blame him for everything I never had
Fall back cuz I remember I was always mad
Constantly in trouble, I was always bad
Used to whip my ass for stealin and skippin class
Just basically fuckin up, they said I was nothing but a fuck up
Your fuckin nuts, just wait and see
I can't wait to make them eat that shit they talk bout me
I'm gonna make granny proud of me
Be someone that I can be, proud to be
They ain't gonna make no ass out of me
How did we, overcome such obstacles and setbacks
They told me I was average but I just couldn't accept that
Let that, be those words carved in my headstone
P. S. you hatin muthafuckas were dead wrong

( Chorus ) 2x

Told you muthafuckas I won, I was gon do it
I was gon do it, still you doubted me... still you doubted me

( Verse 2 )
Day turn to night, I paid the cost for the fame
I was drawn to the game like a moth to a flame
Guess you could say I had a troublesome past
Rememberin talkin to mama, talking through glass
The look in her eye, boy I'm so sick of your ass
You're never gonna change, you're just like your dad (damn!)
A look in her face that told me I was mistake
She wish she had never made, goes from back from in the day
What came from the grave, was a message she didn't wanna hear
Remember that trip from hell, well here's your little souvenir
Don't drink no Belvedere, I blow that killer smoke
I hit that volume button and let them guerillas go
You didn't know or see the growth through the concrete
Makin million dollars merely speakin over drum beats
Yes did, been telling you since I was a kid
And you was bonded, get on with that bullshit

( Chorus ) 2x

( Verse 3 )
I rolled my eyes, as if to say fuck all y'all
All I ever had was my muthafuckin Paw Paw
My gramma, fed me catfish and coleslaw
I hit the weed then pass it to my road dog
I grip the steering wheel, I'm mashin gas pedal
Bitch, I'm gonna be here when the muthafuckin dust settles
Probably been off if I had just let go
I wonder where I'd be in life if I just said no
But life's too short for me to ponder questions I'll never answer
But why am I still smoking from all I've lost from cancer
At this point in life, all my worries are financial
And any losses that I have to take will be substantial
I'm not stopping because it's not an option
Get it straight, I'm not sweepin and not moppin
A muthafuckin thing, you get that boss
And all that real job talk just piss Stak off

( Chorus ) 2x</pre>
