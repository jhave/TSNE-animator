[Chorus: Grand Funk Railroad "Heartbreaker" sample]
Once I had a little girl
Sometimes I think about her
But you know, she's not really there
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker is bringing me down

[The Reverend William Burk]
Yeah, we stepping in the spot, looking so fly
Dime on my arm, and I'm dumb high
Raised in the Chi, no need to ask why
I'm a playa til the day that I die
Curbing and stepping out from the back, back, back
The fans is making his pockets fat, fat, fat
If haters got problems, he got the gat, gat, gat
Just call him the new millennium mack, mack, mack
Playing them ladies, holding all the 3-80's
And, doing whatever to make a stack, stack, stack
Stepping up in the spot, looking oh so fly
Dimes on his arms, and he dumb high
Raised up in the Chi, never in need to ask why
He gon' play until the day that the boy die
Billionaire dreams, gaming ass swing
Yacht, saying things, getting that CREAM

[Chorus: Grand Funk Railroad "Heartbreaker" sample]
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker is bringing me down

[The Game]
Pushing my way through the hood in the 'lac, 'lac, 'lac
Gun on my lap, gotta stay strapped and I
Been through the Chi a million times, never been lost
Thinking I'm slipping, you sniffing lines, boy, I
Step out the house in my Louis shades and my
7-5-8's, Oakland A's, I'm feeling like
Goldie in the Mack, Mack, Mack
Bitch on my arm, look at her back, back, back
She make them dollars stack, bankrolls and
Crystal, Ferrari's, I'm
Driving and rolling the sack, fingers is fucking the cat
Feeling so smooth, and I'm thinking it's that, that, that
Roset was pouring like, fountains, I'm drowning
With 26's on the ride, look at the license plate
They say I'm a

[Chorus: Grand Funk Railroad "Heartbreaker" sample]
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker is bringing me down
Once I had a little girl
Sometimes I think about her
But you know, she's not really there
When memories do call, I just, I just can't live without her
But trying all the time, is so hard to bear
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker is bringing me down</pre>
