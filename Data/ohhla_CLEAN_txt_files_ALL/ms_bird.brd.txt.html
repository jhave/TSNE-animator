(Intro:Baby)
Uh huh uh huh
Cut me up in my head, Cut me up nigga fuck
Ay ay Fresh, its all gravy baby
Its my turn nigga, I'm under the burn biotch
If you ain't getting money, you's a crazy motherfucker (got to be a crazy motherfucker)
I ain't getting money, I'm probably a crazy motherfucker (lord help me)
This is a biotch, biotch

[Baby]
Come on nigga
Its them pimpin, ballin, gangster macks
Theys old school caddies with them bows and racks
The new school bens with them bows to match
But its the Birdman daddy got them O's of crack
A nigga off the diet cause a nigga gettin fat
Them throwback jerseys with them throwback hats
Burberry timbs with the fence to match
And I'm so so fly, and mommy like that
Ounces of that purple and we do it by the sac
Rag-top bens with them rag-top lacs
Nothing to a gangsta nigga choak your strap
We live for money, hoes cooking that crap
Them 20" rims and them tires are flat
There ain't no question, that stunna is a mack
A nigga thought it was over but bitch we back
With daimonds in the middle PIMP, daimonds in the back BITCH

[Chorus: Mannie Fresh - repeat 2X]
Every Place that I went to
About a hundrend bad broads say they sent you
A picture of themselves but naked, ya heard
They all wanna be Ms. Bird, Ms. Bird

[Baby]
You know I got that Crystal on the rocks
You see a nigga's jewels, no name on the watch
Until a nigga die these cops gon watch
But I don't give a fuck nigga, the shit don't stop
All I'm trying to do is stack a knot
Them aligator seats with them brand new drops
Them hoes gonna jock cause they see a nigga hot
Riding on my jet skiis behind a nigga yot
Ten up in my ear ma ten up on a watch
Real hot girls gonna jock a spot
So grab a nigga dick bitch drop it like its hot
The same old nigga off them up-town blocks
I came around your corner and I shit your spot
It's (?) and I serve your block
A Cash Money hot boy and I pop the lock
A know beat boy with the rooka rooka rock biotch

[Chorus] - 2X

[Mannie Fresh]
Now Dada, Barbara, Kiesha, Tarisa and Dawn
I'm tired of having sex and I want to go home
But I cant leave yet cause they kissing each other
Plus I'm hot and I'm horny, I'm getting my rubbers
What that tatoo on your tittie say, Hood Rich
Let me your ass, oh wolves' bitch
God damn Ms. Kiesha ain't your momma a teacher
Your sister is a mister and your daddys a preacher
Now you's a mixed up screwed down dike type chick
If you ain't eating pussy then you sucking good dick
Now every place that I go to
About a hundred grimey niggas say the know you
And they all got that movie that you made with that man
Don Da Don Don Don, stop playin
If you seeee, the movieeee (triple x bitoch)

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
