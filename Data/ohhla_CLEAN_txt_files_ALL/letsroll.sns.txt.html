[Intro - Female voice - speaking Spanish]
Mi amor, tu quero tanto
Y cant de gadi mis tanto dinero
Vesa me, amori, I mentua
I papi, I I I papi
I papi, I I I papi
I papi, I papi
I I I papi, I I I papi

[Southstar - talking over female]
What's up? Ok, yeah, uh huh
Once again, Mr. Smilez
Southstar, yeah, ya'll know how we do
Check it, uh, uh, uh, uh

Right now I'm 'bout to bring ya'll the funk (ok)
Windows down, let the beat bang out the trunk (let's go)
Roll it up, blow dirt, only smoke skunk (*inhaling*)
I'm the clean up hitter, so I ain't never gonna bunt (*coughing noise*)
Don't front, I'm gonna keep doin' what I want (uh huh)
Got a couple dimes, but ya'll never see me flaunt (nah)
Chicks be like South, ain't you ready for a wife?
Nah I just want to get brains, move on with life (haha)
I take girls on trips and shopping sprees
Romance 'em, before they drop to their knees (get down)
Type of cat, that don't even ice out your beat (bling)
And give you the chills, in a 100 degree heat
Drop the top down, just to feel the breeze
And take all ya'll money, why ya'll catchin' Z's (*snoring noise*)
I'm gonna run up in spots, reppin' as D
And have the whole world sayin', I'm the best MC (that's right)

[Chorus - Male singing]
Yo, we gotta get that dough
Then we gotta get some more
I hope your ready to rollll

And hey (hey), you know we gotta get paid
I hope you think that way
If so, it's time to rollll

[Smilez]
Uh, uh, uh, Smilez, uh, uh, yo, yo, yo
I went from the two door Ac, to the Lexus kid
From the Lee jeans, to the coochie stiffness
From bein' bad at class, people call me stupid
Now I get so much brain, I'm a honor student
Ya'll not ready, ya'll MTV wannabes
Before 11, tryin' to get in the club for free
I see ya'll, I sent love to all a ya'll
Cause when I reppin' no fees, it's like I make head calls
I hate to ball, you know how that go, Benzo, or viente dos
That like damn is that ya'll
Of course dog, run up in the club, toss broads
Dude I'm a hazard like "I'm a ball ta"
Little do' nigga, Bud Light sippa
Rolled up on 16's, get that outta here nigga
I'm about them figgas, G5 on the whippa
Get ready to roll, and let's go nigga

[Chorus]

[Southstar]
Yo, what you want to do spend my cheese?
What you wanna go overseas?
Want to ride, right beside of me
In the Lex, or the Benz, or the drop Bentley (ha)
Well tell me, what you gonna do for me?
Ha, is that what you gonna do for me? (haha)
Well you better call 2 or 3
Of your freakest friends for Smilez &amp; me

[Smilez]
Yo, even as Smilez sittin' ok
I still run up in yo' place, and grab what's on your plate
Since the single drop niggaz like "you came and went"
Tryin' to get fat as fuck, belly over my waist
Now chicks wanna holla at Smilez, cause they know
The neck, the wrist, the ankles so po' (uh huh)
Chain went from 18 inches to 34 (wow)
Atari niggas, can't match this X Box flow

[Southstar]
And we livin' this dream, makin' this cream
Bless my team, and makin' sure we all gonna gleam (yeah)
Pullin' up in cars and rims, never seen
And when the sun hit chrome, it'll let off beams
And when we at a red light, it'll keep on spinnin' (watch)
We ain't balled out yet, it's just the beginnin' (uh huh)
Never fallin' off man, keep on spittin' (let's go)
Dakari, show them how the beat keep hittin'

[Chorus] - 2X

[Talking over the chorus]
yeah, uh, ok, uh, let's go, uh, uh
street ballers, uh, T-money, uh Dakari, uh, uh</pre>
