[Busta Rhymes]
Yeah.. back by popular demand, it's about to get Godly
Yeah.. hold it now!  AOWWW!
C'mon, c'mon (c'mon).. yeah
Huh.. c'mon, c'mon (c'mon).. yeah
Huh!

Bear witness on the way we stay cuttin 'em down
In two-thousand-two, shuttin 'em down
Have you sippin on it 'til you start suckin it down
I hope you know that we ain't FUCKIN around
Niggaz you betta BELIEVE when you see me the shit be double trouble
I overLOAD and take this SHIT to another level
I shut it down, sho' nuff, pack ya bags
Let me work, make it hurt, cause I'm next wreck
Lay flat nigga hit the deck, or face big DISrespect
In addition the SHIT we wreck
Firework flow, spit and make a BIG effect
Bang it in the truck until ya whole SHIT eject, c'mon
Stop nigga, close ya shop
SCUD missile launched fire burn quick, every SHIT we drop
From the GROUND with another sound yes we put it down
and always BOOM and pound, so we shut 'em down

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes] + (Pete Rock)
I shut 'em down (shut 'em down, shut shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (sh-sh, sh-sh, shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (shut 'em down, shut shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (shut 'em, sh-shut, shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (shut 'em down, shut-sh-shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (sh-sh, sh-sh, shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (shut 'em down, shut shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (shut 'em down, shut shut 'em down)

[Busta Rhymes]
Hah!
One two three four five six seven eight nine
Comin THROUGH, betta tuck in ya shine
Once ya lookin for the HEAT, if ya seek it will find
I had these devils watchin me sayin these sneakers is mine!
Now hold up - we drop the bomb first then get under ya mom's skirt
to get her frenzied like a motherfuckin rock concert
While you're busy and tryin to FIGURE what the God's worth
I'll malfunction your plans 'til the motherfuckin sound work
Now I'ma CUSS when I BUST ya ass
And leave 'em stiff when I hit 'em like a MUSTARD gas
Steam fire when I puff, then I flick the ash
You wack and I had enough, put your shit in the trash
Now you know we got the shit in the smash
Wild until you slip and you crash, y'know we keep the SHIT in the stash
From the GROUND when we come around, yes we put it down
and always BOOM AND POUND, when we shut 'em down

[Chorus] - w/ minor variations

[Intro to "Genesis"]
As we rockin you all to the future
Ahhh, we come to give you that
Operatin like we be official
Yeah, we come to multiply
And we're plannin the scheme for the long win
Yeah, our shit be always right
Every move you'll see how it's related..</pre>
