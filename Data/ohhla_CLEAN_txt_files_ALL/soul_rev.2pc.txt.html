[Soul]	My attitude is shitty
	My message to the censorship committee
	Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
[Pac]	The critics or the cops?
[Soul]	The courts or the crooks, don't look so confused
	Take a closer look

	Tryin to stay jail free
[Soul]	What the fuck does Quayle know
	of young black males?

[Pac]	Huh, I pack a nine millimeter cause I got em livin hotter
	than the 4th of July, if I gotta die, I gotta
[Soul]	Momma told me, "Don't let em fade me..
	.. nigga don't let em make you crazy!"
	Game is what she gave me
[Pac]	Gotta watch your back, strapped
[Soul]	Real niggaz rat-pack
[Pac]	If you get your ass taxed, bring a gat back
	That's not the way we made it

[Pac]	I came up
	My message to the censorship committee
	Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
	Cops pull me over, check my plates, but I'm legal
[Soul]	You couldn't get me, figure, "Fuck with a niggaz people"
[Pac]	They got me trapped, gat with the motherfuckin hammer back
[Soul]	Cops on my back, just cause I'm black, SNAP
[Pac]	Now I'm guilty?
	Message to the censorship committee
	Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
[both]	All you punk police will never find peace 
	on the streets til the niggaz get a piece, fuck em!
[Soul]	They kill you to control ya
	(PAY) top dollar for your soul
[both]	Real niggaz don't fold, straight souljah!
[Pac]	Can't find peace on the streets
	til the niggaz get a piece, fuck police, hear them screamin
	Fuck em!  Can't find peace on the streets
