Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I stayed out late last night
But I nothing could drink
Could help me drink you off my mind
Everywhere I looked, I saw your face
And I wonder, and I wonder
If there still might be
A little space in your heart for me
'Cause I'm so cold, I'm so alone
And I miss you, babe

So won't you come to my rescue
Shake this pain from my soul
And take this fool back in your heart baby
I'll go crazy if you don't
'Cause I'm a mess here without you
Ain't no pill for this pain
So please, please come to my rescue baby
Make it right away

I was a fool to leave
Leave behind everything that meant everything to me
Every day and night my heart pays the price
And I'm out here, stranded out here
On this lonely road, I'm so lost won't you lead me home
I need you back, need one more chance
And I miss you, babe

So won't you come to my rescue
Shake this pain from my soul
And take this fool back in your heart baby
I'll go crazy if you don't
'Cause I'm a mess here without you
Ain't no pill for this pain
So please, please come to my rescue baby
Make it right away

I'm drowning baby
I need you to save me, yeah
Don't leave me like this
Throw me a line, baby one more time

Won't you come to my rescue
Shake this pain from my soul
And take this fool back in your heart baby
I'll go crazy if you don't
'Cause I'm a mess here without you
Ain't no pill for this pain
So please, please come to my rescue baby
Make it right away

Make it right away</pre>
