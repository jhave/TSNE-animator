[Keith]
Yo Jacky, this Keith. 
It's the answering machine
I left the keys under the rug
There's some meat up in the closet
If you goin through it out tonight
I'ma run up to Tower Records to get a pizza
aight
Ima come back 
yeah

[Dr. Dooom]
Chewin alligator meat live cowsteak 
sittin on old newspapers by thekitchen sink
You think im off limits driving a 74 Dodge Plymouth
Up the street with human feet colored apple-green 
with spots eatinblueberry Pop Tarts
With the eighth body in my trunk my elbow bleeds with lumps
Walkin from the sanitation dump with rotten skulls 
on my waterbed with Miller beer kegs
Blood in my cabinet, ears in my closet 
watchin the Raptors play the Houston Rockets
With your arms in the freezer I grab a icicle 
puttin fingerprints on my bicycle
Walkin up to have a drink at the club ?there is? three Irish chicks
lookin at me like im sick
Walkin by chin-chins I stole the keys from ya friends
Lookin out ya ?Madrion? hotel window like Elvis Presley 
coming down the elevator
Good evening mister excuse me pardon me with body parts
And credit cards walkin down Sunset Boulevard past the red light
I threw a rat with mayonnaise at ya head lights
Four blonde girls screamed and put on their hi-beams
I fake like i'm ?vomiting smoking sick? threw acid on their stomachs
And drove of  with a wig down La Brea listen to a tape by Slayer
Parked in a parking lot behind Burger King 
eatin a raw pack of chicken wings
With blood on my fingers I blast a CD by the Staple Singers
The cops told me to turn it down, 
they like my shoes from Buster Brown
I went up the block an bought some incense 
for the wrong smells in the air conditioner vents
Hey kid need twenty cents havin a cook-out with my neighbor
How ya like the meat flavor mmmm

Chorus: 
[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] sorry bout the noise last night
[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] hey hey yall got some toilet paper
[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] don't mind the smell from across the hall
[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] see ya at twelve midnight comin over

[Jacky Jasper]
Ya shell shocked, cuts a rock mad ?blood? vulcan like Spock
Pull ya ribs out suck ya own cock 
Block twenty-five knots laid up outta luck 
Cut ya ass open stuff ya like a duck what
?Attraction? recarnation in a slump twenty-five cents
 And a german dick pumped up
Shoulda known the killa from the jump junk
In veins impedes the brain hijackin planes
Pull a kotex out of Louis Lane
Explain the sky rain 
Cadillacs and dead bitches consort with witches
Twenty-five sistas pussies with blisters we burn'em in rivers
Saviors of pimps and concubines
Have you ever asked yourself will you fuck Marilyn Manson
Or become Charlie Manson Deathwish
Or become Charles Bronson
Take your testicles and your dick for ransom
In a tea jar right next to the cookie jar
With nose and tits smoking a cigar 
Beverly Hills superstar Jacky Jasper
Keith a.k.a. Dr. Dooom
Twenty-five dead chicks with an ice pick
Machine guns galactica brooms pay for room two
Into sci-fi we stay fly
Seven heads an ten horns
Side died ripped open eyeball for a subway token
Asshole broken manics in a cave spandex columbo smokin
Panties in liquid pinesol soakin 
Selling glass to Dr. Bones, Dr. Dooom ?ass lie on cellphone?
Sportin scuba fins in a limo
Eatin fingers on a hunt
Attached with a pick ass out dick out
Nigga what you want?
[Dr. Dooom]
I want a kotex with whip cream

Chorus: 

[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] sorry bout the noise last night
[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] hey hey yall got some toilet paper
[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] don't mind the smell from across the hall
[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] I'm comin over twelve midnight to borrow some sugar</pre>
