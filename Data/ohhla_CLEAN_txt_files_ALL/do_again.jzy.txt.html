Song:   Do It Again
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

(Yeah) (Say I do it all again)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You know I grind, straight hustle, hit licks
Get em break em down, weigh bricks
Late night count it up talk shit
That why I had to try one for the streets right quick

[Jeezy]
Four one two fives two on the counter
Whats the scene? a triple bean
Two money counters two fifties dem five hunrdeds
They in the plastic oil thangs them one thousandths
They in the attic
Yellow shit that have you itchin that instant linchin
What ya say its too short thats Walter Payton
Get it right thats fifty six that thirty six
Twenty eight thats times two thats plenty six
Fifty six a quarter short thats seven vics
Residue up in the wrap thats evidence
Yellow water its hella water thats what it took
Drop the price its twenty five thats reggie bush

[Chorus]

[Slick Pulla]
Do it all again hell yeah you know I would
I almost lost my life puttin this chrome under the hood
I damn near lost it all for these cars and these jewels
The D.A. tried to make the case thick like glue

Trials, tribulations, you know we heard em boss
We don't eat beef burgers you know we burnin those
The microwave will get it done but I prefer the stove
All black sivich hatch back now I'm on the roll
Made the play and came back now I gotta fresh sack
Four hours there four hours back
Had to get that road cash residue on the stacks we just call it
Blow cash
In the streets pickin chins thats better than no cash

[Chorus]

[Yo Gotti]
Brickz of white, fields of purple
I'ma landscaper, construction worker
Mr. Kool-Aid drinker, pitcher purple
Mr. he so real, break bread with his circle {yo goootttii}
Straight thuggin, straight hustling
White, whole thangs for twenty nothing
What it do sixteen, seventeen, I'm talkin fish that purest shit you ever seen
I'm talkin murder first 48 crime scene I'm talkin me the realest nigga {yo goottii}
You ever seen, in my life is all I know, I cant pretend you lock me up, let me out and I'ma do it again

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And I do it all again</pre>
