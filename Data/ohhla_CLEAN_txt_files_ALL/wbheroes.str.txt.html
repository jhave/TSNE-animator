Turn left up the street
Nothing but gray concrete and deadbeats
Grab something to eat, Mickey D's or KFC
Only one choice in the city, don't voice in my pity
Now let's get to the nitty gritty
June reminds me of my first ditty played unique
Still 16 and feeling horny
Point the sky and feel free
See, people are all equal
Smiles are front and behind me
Swim in the deep blue sea corn fields sway lazily
All smiles all easy
Where ya from, what ya on and what's ya story?
Mezmorizing tones rising pianos, this is my zone so stop cloning
Pick paper scissors or stone cuz me and you are the same
I known you all my life I don't know your name
(The name's European Bob Sordid, anyway)
We'll have a dance now see ya later
Pleased to meet ya - likewise, a pleasure
We All Smile
We All Sing

The night slowly fades and goes slow motion
All the commotion becomes floating emotions
Same piano loops over, arms wave eyes roll back
And jaws fall open, see it's a focus
Enchanted is blocking the toilets
Dizzy new heights blinded by the lights
These people are for life
So, back to his place at the end of the night
Yo, they could settle wars with this
If only they will, imagine the world's leaders on pills
And imagine the morning after, falls causing disaster
Don't talk to me I don't know ya, but this ain't tomorrow
For now I still love ya, hours fly over
Sail around diamonds and pearls
Never seen so many thick girls
Discover new worlds, look at my watch can't focus
Last 2 hours are lost every move fills me with lust
All of Life's problems I just shake off
Yo, mad little events happen
Things might pan out in a few blue
Maddens are like the toilets
Big beefy bouncers out to reveal us
Geezers aren't easy first timers
Kids on wiz darlings on Charlie
All come together for this party
All races many faces from places you never heard of
Where ya from, what's ya name and what ya want?
Sing to the words fecks to the fat ones
The tribal drums the sun's rising
We All Smile
We All Sing

Then the girl in the cafe taps me on the shoulder
I realize 5 years went by and I'm older
Memories smolder, winter's colder
But that same piano loops over and over and over
The road shines and the rain washes away
Same Chinese take-away selling shit in a tray
Stalk all around I walk down same sights same sounds
New beats, though, solid concrete under my feet
No suprises no treats
The world stands still as my mind slushes around
The washer nut bolt in my crown
The Life's been up and down since I walked from that crowd
We All Smile
We All Sing

Out of respect for Johnnie Walker, Paul Oakenfold, Nicky Holloway
Danny Rampling and all the people who gave us these times
And to the government, I stick my middle finger up
with regards to the criminal justice bill

For all the heroes out and on the way

We All Sing</pre>
