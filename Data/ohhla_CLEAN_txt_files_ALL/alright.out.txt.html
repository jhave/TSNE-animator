Everything
is gon' be alright
you know?
This is for my young thug Kamillion
Cause we told him, man
Yeah
We told him he's comin back

[ EDI ]
The dawn comes after the night
And there's a silver lining surrounding every cloudy day
Seems like hard times been a friend of mine I can't shake
Still I rise with a clique of thugs they can't break
Pain mixed with rain and no sunshine
And all we wanted was to be happy just one time
We had no choice, no voice, only our faith in God
And the hunger to hustle and get this paper, Lord
Out in the cold, lost souls, nowhere to go
Hooked up with Jay [Name] then we found a home
See, with y'all on the side the world can be against ya
And they still gon' lose, that's the realer
Feel us, we ain't killers, we just riders for the have-nots
Cause some of us ain't got it all, tucked in a stash spot
Oh yes, we're back, baby, run and tell a friend
Let em witness how we get us through this hell again
Come on

[ CHORUS ]
Everything is gonna be alright
We coming back
Like we said we would
Everything is gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good

[ Kastro ]
Our life is like a gunfight, hard to love life
No hope and no light, dark in the sunlight
Dodge and duck ( ? )
I hate to question you God, but I ask you Lord
Is you comin back just like they said you would?
I need you here now, I'm yo child, it ain't good
But I'ma keep my faith in you and that's the truth
We live ( ? ) thugged out without a clue
Waitin for revolution, with a love for shootin
At each other, even brothers kill each other stupid
And that's the way it been since I could remember
Born into a storm 3rd day of December
1976 I shot in the mix
Popped out mommy twat, how did it come to this?
I know my God love me and that's a real fact
He ain't gone for long, my dog comin back

[ CHORUS ]
Everything is gonna be alright
He's coming back
Like he said he would
Everything is gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good

[ Young Noble ]
Pac, why you leave us? This world don't need us
But when we tell em you here they don't believe us
My Black Jesus, the only one that tried to free us
Nobody cared but you took time to teach us
Bear with me even though it seems my heart empty
Somethin's always missin without y'all with me
Tupac and Yafeu, I pray to you
And still we live every day for you
I'ma stay loyal till I'm dead and gone
Outlaw till I die so forever it's on
Use my body as a vehicle
It lead a soldier through the storm, I believe in you
Stayin true to everything you worked for
Hurt for, had fingers in the dirt for
I know it's worth it, Lord
Cause Yak watch every step I make
You gon' live on, soldier, every breath I take
You still here
You still here
You gon' live on, soldier, every breath I take
You still here

[ CHORUS ]
Everything is gonna be alright
They coming back
Like we said they would
Everything is gonna be alright
They coming back
For the true and good

Everything is gonna be alright
We coming back
Like we said we would
Everything is gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good

Everything's gonna be alright

We're comin back</pre>
