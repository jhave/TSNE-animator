I see clearly now
Bad Boy, ready
Dream
We rock the beat
And we rock the beat
I see clearly now
And we rock the beat
26, Bad Boy baby
Remix

[Dream]
Pullin' petals off a flower, tryna get your way
Keep pullin' 'til it tells what you wanna say
Girl you can pick a field full of daisies
But he'd still be my baby

I know you can hardly wait 'til I'm away from him
Instinctively, I know what you're thinking
You'll be giving him an open invitation
But my baby won't be takin' it, no

1 -	You can pout your cherry lips
	Try to tempt him with a sweet kiss
	You can flirt your pretty eyes
	Cuz he ain't got his hands tied

2 -	No chains to unlock
	So free to do what he wants
	He's into what he's got
	He loves me, he loves you not

	No matter what you do
	He's never gonna be with you
	He's into what he's got
	He loves me, he loves you not

[Puffy]
I can see clearly now

[Dream]
You're the kind of girl that's always up for do or dare
Only want him because he's there
Always lookin' for a new ride
The grass is greener on the other side

You're the kind of girl who's not used to hearin' no
All your lovers try to take you where you wanna go
Doesn't matter how hard you try
You're never gonna get with my guy

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

[Black Rob] (Puffy)
Yo, yo, I wake up in the morning for the breakfast in bed (uh huh)
And wind up with the breakfast and head
You fire hot, you get the Lexus in red (uh huh)
But you know I'm ghetto like ?Christians and bread? (a week)
Tradin' the moon and the sun (yeah)
For hard work and fun (that's right)
You know it ain't no rest
And why you stressin' me, huh (why you stressin' me, huh)
I love you like Kung Fu and new ones
Don't worry about Susan, cuz you the one (you the one)
I make that spinach somewhere in Venice (bounce)
I don't mean to ignore you, I put you in the fence (come on)
I ain't got time for hotlines
Probably a hot nine, you think and I find (take it, heh)
Oh contrare, I won't flare
Catch me on Con Air, causin' a bomb scare
So much cream, my thumb green
A million scene reminds me of a dream

Repeat 2 to fade (with Puffy ad-libing)</pre>
