("When you live in the past... hahaha! ...ya lost!")

[King L]
Rock star bitch, call me Elvis
M.O.B., she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killin, while I'm drillin
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both suck like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
Cause niggaz got cocaine to move
I be goin hard, I got a name to prove
Killin 'em, hernia, I make the pain improve

[Chorus: King L]
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down

[Kanye West]
This the greatest shit in the club
...since "In Da Club"
It's so packed I might ride around
on my bodyguard back like Prince in the club
She said, "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I said, "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evening end
When I, go raw, I like to leave it in
When I, wake up, I like to go again
When I, go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't, go to work, same clothes again
And her, heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin close to him
Yeezus just rose again

[Chorus]

[Outro: sample of Beenie Man's "Memories"]
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
When the tings are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
When the tings are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have</pre>
