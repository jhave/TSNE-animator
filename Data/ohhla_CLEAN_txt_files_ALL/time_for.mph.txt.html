[Muph]
I've got a lot of time for beats made by Suffa
I've got a lot of time for treats with more meat than plugger
I've got a lot of time for girls under the cover
I've got a lot of time for my father, my sister, my mother
And I can't forget Draino my brother
I've got time for the girl that's my lover
Me and my mates have time for each other
Got a lot of time for the beach in the summer
I'm just a-nother person, spends half his time versin
Extremely determined to stay away from the vermin
Only twenty-one so life has just begun
And my aim to have continuous fun under the sun
Learning with each day as it passes
No time to waste on kissing arses
No time for bastards and bitches, crafting good sickness
Too much time for music, not enough for fitness

[Suffa]
I got a lot of time for tapes mixed by Reflux
Got a lot of time for beats made my Beatnuts
Got a lot of time for small butts and B cups
C cups, D cups, damn even double Z cups
Rhyme style's fat like the rack on that bitch
Got a lot of time for emcees who's on that shit
Got a lot of time for Pressure and Debris
Like the Muph and Suff got time for beats made by me
I got no time for kids who want to be American
And got no time for beef with vegetarians
Got time for rhymes that get me open like cesareans
Got time for my boys who drink and act like Bavarians
I got a lot of time for puffers in the winter
And ciphers that I enter with Suffa in the centre
Got no time for the piss and the lies that people tell me
Got time for Slaughterhouse my favourite LP</pre>
