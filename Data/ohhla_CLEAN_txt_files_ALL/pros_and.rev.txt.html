[Intro] [Evidence talking]
Yo Rev. It's pros and cons
They was sayin' anything pro is positive, anything con is negative

[Verse One]
Yeah, there's a reason why my friends did cocaine
I sat home at night tryin' to get my beats pro gain
Propane, sound provider, own lane
A protagonist with a process that's profane
Professor X and pro O.F. is pain
But life reunites, dance the clouds like Soul Train
Trained to pull a dame, close the deal like whoa maine
Lowland professional
Hall of fame
All in the same with ballers and Harley Davidson scholars
Not a mission for dollars, it's for the people in pain
We reach but when they breach, people are slain
This ain't a way to proceed when you see what it gain
I'm pro family, still use profanity
Party time, like my damn manager's Wayne
Plannin' on damagin' things with a cannon and flame
Fuckin' amateurs get hung by they own gold chain
Code name Evidence
Name same ever since Revolution stepped in L.A. (Fresher than this)'
+The Freshest+
The program 
Back down to no man
Speed flow for slow jams
A legend this way (Now turn it up)
Throw on a vest to protect my chest
And grab more than a picket sign when time to protest
Provocative prose, the flows project
I'm a professor
You get your fuckin' progress checked

[Scratch chorus] 
"I know the pros and cons" - M.O.P. 'Face Off'
"You know the fuckin' concept" - Planet Asia 'Definition Of Ill"
"So get with the program" - Show &amp; A.G. 'Represent'
"I know the pros and cons" - M.O.P. 'Face Off'
"You know the fuckin' concept" - Planet Asia 'Definition Of Ill"
"With this program"

[Verse Two]
I don't sign contracts I sign agreements
I don't conversate without reason
I'm not a convict
I'm a free man
While you on Con Air, dealin' with your demons
The constitution's a conflict of interests
I'm not a con man, I'm honest, that's the difference
There's pros and cons in hustlin' dope
We're from the, only game where cons turn pro
We're from L.A. where there's constant bomb threats
Some fully executed
Not concepts
Simple messages, so clear it's complex
This shit right here is teamwork
Not a contest
Now there are a couple cons I will say
You know the ones with 'Ks' like Chaka Kahn &amp; Kanye (Now turn it up)
I should have never done +Confidence+
Done the same song but called the shit Dominance
I don't congratulate, I celebrate
Y'all catch the fish
Motherfucker I sell the bait
And sell in weight, I collect on conjure 
I'm like, damn, this some real shit I'm on to
I'm good in different hoods through my language and etiquette
E.V. hate the con, still love Connecticut 
I don't concentrate, I focus
I never contemplate, I press forward
Oh!

[Scratch chorus] 
"I know the pros and cons" - M.O.P. 'Face Off'

"You know the fuckin' concept" - Planet Asia 'Definition Of Ill"
"The pros and the cons" - Xzibit 'On Bail'</pre>
