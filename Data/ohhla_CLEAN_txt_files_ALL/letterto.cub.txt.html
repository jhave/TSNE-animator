What up twin

Im just sittin back man thinking about all the good times we had
Theres a lot of things been going on since you been gone
I just thought it was time for me to sit down and write you a letter
You know what I am sayin, a letter from the heart

Yo, yo
Before I take a shot, I always make a toast to the sky
Blow somesmoke in the air so we both can get high
At night I hold my rosarys tight and hope to get by
Close my eyes and ask the lord why he chose you to die
Though, I believe in God, I chose my own road cause of pride
I dont abide to no bible cause most of them lie
Lifes like a roller coaster ride, just try to hold on and drive
Its all about surviving, one day we all gonna die
I tried to hide all these feelings I was holding inside
Cause they always told me thugs aint suppose to cry
And show their emotional side
But, it soaked up my eyes
Cause I never had nobody really close to me die
Couldnt understand it at first, so how do this work
You were just here full of cheer, now I'm following your hearse
Its outta this earth, I felt like I was damn with a curse
Had to light candle in church to handle the hurt
In retrospect, I always respect the man that you were
A man of your word that always put his family first
With talent superb all you wanted was to be heard
And You got your chance all of your fans are proud of your work
You made it outta of the dirt and got on top of the world
But you still stood in the hood with your son and to little girls
You in iced out chains, your wife was rockin the pearls
You lived a ghetto fabulous life, the Bronx was your borough
And when the fame came you never changed. You kept it so thorough
We did the same thing, poppin champagne to we earled
You shocked the world, twin, every time you rapped on a track
You had cats like How this fat dude could flow like that?
Is he black? Is he packin the mack in the back of the acc?
The only Spanish rapper to snatch up a platinum plaque
Thats a fact. Its been written in stones, from here to Rome
When it comes to spittin them poems. You sit on the throne
I wish you was home. Life is so different alone
Spoke to Liza and the kids, little Chris is so grown
Hes your own spittin image. Its just like you were cloned
You know I treasure Manda and Sesha, like they were my own
Lizas still tryin to get it together
She had your back through the stormy weather
For that, I will never forget her
Times are tougher then leather
As for me, things could be better
I needed to clear my head up
Thats why I had to write you this letter
Since you been gone, Joes been stronger then ever, still with Laurena
How can he go to bed knowing hes stealin your cheddar?
About a mil or better. To me hes as real as pleather
We built this together. Still, in all he had me set up
I should of known better
I let it ride for too long
Let it slide for too long
Let it hide for too long
Now I am tryin to move on
Without tryin to do wrong
but my pride is too strong
Im a ride through the storm
With a hundred troops strong
No bullet-proofs on
Glocks cocked and locked and ready to shoot form
Im just tryin to put you on twin, to whats going on
A lot of back stabbin since you been gone
A lot of whack rappin comin from the so-called Don
A lot of black ballin happenin. No matter twin, I'm still going strong
Tonys still singin songs, tryin to swing it along
Hes no longer foundation, sayin Joe put him on
Hes dead wrong
Armeggedion still aint on
Prospect- back in the projects, livin with moms
Words born
Remys the realist, she know what the deal is
feelin like there is still a chance wishin you could come and heal us
But the thrill is gone, I'm no longer part of that
Im back where I started at
Thats where my heart is at
Cause God knows how hard I scrap
To try to keep it from this
I been a team player, he chose to play at his own risk
Sunkiss still comes around, we still get down
We puff a pound whenever Chuck and C come into town
Toom is illin, hes down in Orlando makin a killin
Buildin his own army with soldiers, ready and willin
Me and Seis still be chillin
Hes fine as well
Still rhymin, still grindin, only time will tell
Gillys stressed out, tryin to figure out his next route
Feelin left out
No more T.S, he checked out
Xed out his tattoos , but he still got you
B is still with me. Full A Clips our old school crew
He stayed true, always been the coolest nigga we knew
Boobys up in the videos with you know who
You was the glue to the puzzle, the key to the struggle
The reason I even chose to be in this hustle
Twin, I love you
No matter what or who tries to judge you
Theres nothing worst than family and friends tryin to fuck you
I stuck through it all, and this is what it all lead up to
Its the closest ones to you that will stick it in and cut you
So much for being humble. I'm comin through with the shovels
Tombstones and all, and turn the hard rocks to rubble
On the double, so you can be at peace with your troubles
Cause even after death, you stress from all these scuffles
Guzzle the liquor, snuffing walls till theres blood on my knuckles
Watchin the devil chuckle, hopin I break down and buckle
In this jungle, its all about survival of the fittest
Though you died, you never rid us
Twin your still alive in spirit. I can feel it
I know your up in heaven right now
Hangin out in thugs mansion. You and Pac, whilin out
Livin the kings lifestyle, with platinum wings iced out
Bet you and Biggie in the Angels lounge, poppin Crystal
Getting high with Freaky Tah, lightin up white owls
Thuggin it out with Big L, rollin dice on the clouds
Aaliyah, smilin down. Left Eye is still type wild
Buggin out, partyin, every bodys up in the house
You kickin freestyles while Master J hypes up the crowd
Aint no fights breakin out, its all love right now
Im just writing down how I feel hopin you hear me
Puttin my heart and soul in it, so you can see it all clearly
I hold you dearly in my thoughts cause like you theres no other
Sincerely Yours, Cuban Link, your twin your brother
Baby I love you!

[Outro]
I still got your back twin
Your brothers here
You even got your own day up in the Bronx
We on top of the world
Yeah I'm a ride with you baby
Ill always ride with you til the day I die
Thats my word</pre>
