[Intro]
Don't act like that
Whassup wit you? Whassup?
That's a bad lil' beotch

[Too $hort]
Lil' shorty got a nasty lil' dance
With a whole lot of ass in them pants
Do you think I'm a passionate man?
Ice cold player with a master plan
A lot of females just don't know
That lil' shorty got her own dough
When I met her it was on right away
If I was married, I'd leave my wife today
Light-skinned with the curly hair
Did my finger like this and said "Girl come here"
She's on South Beach, havin lunch with a dude
I whispered in her ear "Later on come through"

[Interlude]
Come on yo shorty we can kick it baby
You know that I'm with it
You can hit me on my phone
We can do it all night long

[Chorus]
(She said) ohh, yeah I really wanna rock your world
Get to know you boy I'll be your girl
Trust me baby you'll be satisfied
You'll be mine tonight
(She said) ohh, yeah I really wanna rock your world
Get to know you boy I'll be your girl
Trust me baby you'll be satisfied
You'll be mine tonight boy

[Too $hort]
That lil' shorty is well stacked
Her shoes, her purse and her belt match
Hella cute even in the morning
A super top notch, better get up on 'em
Ass fat, she's a class act
Menage-a-trois, she don't have that
She's all about them dimes and pennies
Tens and twenties, hundreds and fifties
Whatever you got she'll take it
Make a nigga stop, drop and get naked
I guess it's just a sign of the times
Cause shorty got a crib that's as fly as mines

[Chorus]

[Too $hort]
Lil' shorty is a freak mayne
Gamed up with the street game
Did a lot and left me wantin mo'
Lil' shorty ain't no punk hoe
I don't sip fine wine or drink champagne
Don't mix with fake hoes that think I'm payin
But I do like women, that know about pimpin
Keep gettin money so we don't stop spendin
Lil' shorty knows my background
I was raised out West in a mack's town
I wanna get some money and have fun wit'chu
Lil' shorty what'chu wanna do?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Let's make it happen~!
Smoke one wit'cha potnah mayne
Roll another one
We still blowin
Yeah, we got some real players up in this motherfucker right now
Too $hort representin the real players
Where you at?</pre>
