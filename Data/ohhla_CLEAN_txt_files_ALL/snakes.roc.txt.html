[Intro]
"LISTEN TO THE TRACK BITCH~!"
Ay you gotta listen to this story now
Pay attention, I'ma tell you a story

[Rocko]
Tony fuck with Stan, but see Stan he the man
That boy Stan got guap', he a fool with the yam
But see Stan fuck with Tony, he don't know that Tony phony
And that Tony just got jammed, last week, with some money
And about ten of them bunnies, listen what they told Tony (what?)
He a free man, cause what they really want is Stan
Whole time this nigga Stan, thinkin Tony is his man
He thinkin Tony work with him but Tony workin with The Man
Thinkin Tony got a plan, told Stan about this man
Told him that his sister husband tryin to cop around ten
Stan said - let's make it happen but what Stan don't understand
is today the last day, he'll see the light again
But Ton' don't give a damn, anything to save him
Even if that mean he got to send his nigga to the can
Take heed of what I'm sayin, before it's too late
Just beware of phony niggaz that be smilin in your face

[Chorus - slowed down voice singing]
Smiling faces, sometimes
Pretend, to be your friend
Smiling faces, show no traces
Of the evil that lurks within

[Rocko]
Kim and Janet best friends, and they been that way for years
Janet single but see Kim, got a nigga and two kids
Janet babysit her kids, Janet loves them like they're hers
Janet needs a place to live so Kim let her come live with them
Kim knows her just like her fam, but what Kim don't understand
Is that Janet's not her kin, Janet's not even her friend
Janet's tryin to seek revenge (oh yeah?) Janet's got a plan
Janet's still holding a grudge from back when her and Kim were ten
She devised a perfect plan, Janet's gon' sleep with her man
She lays naked in the kitchen wait for him to come, in
He walks in the door like damm! Yu know a man gon' be a man
In the midst of all of that, he must forgot about Kim
Kim bust's in on them, Janet stands there with her grin
Kim fussin, cussin, hollerin, screamin goin straight nuts on them
Kim cryin out like - damn Jan', I thought you were my friend
Janet said, "You remember you took my boyfriend back when we were ten?"
Damn~!

[Chorus]

[Rocko]
Hey, Michael real cool nigga, but he just not gettin money
(How?) Drought came around, he flexed a nigga for some dummies
Now he ballin like a dog, e'ry night he in the club
Throwin money, poppin bottles, flexin hard he don't give a fuck
Then one night he met this girl, finest girl he ever saw
He say I never seen before, she say I'm here from Arkansas
They kicked it off a couple months she fucked and sucked him like a pole
He say I love your dirty drawers baby I never let you go
Year later they still together, now he feelin like he love her
So he let her in his business cause he felt like he could trust her
She sittin in the kitchen while he bustin down them bricks
She thumbin through the check, he swear he got a gangster bitch
What he don't know 'bout this bitch iseverything she say a lie
Man this bitch ain't who she say she is dis bitch is FBI
Man this game a dirty game, man beware of all the tricks
'Fore you end up just like Mike be sittin in jail about a bitch

[Chorus] - to fade</pre>
