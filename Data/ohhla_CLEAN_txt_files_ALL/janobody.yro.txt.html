(*talking*)
G'yeah, we gon slow things down a lil' bit
So I can take time out, address some issues
Give you the real me, walk with me
I ain't write this one to lose you, you feel me
Walk with me

[Yung Ro]
Nobody understands, so I wrote God a letter
All I wanted was peace, and for my family to do better
It's like they drained the love out me, but I couldn't hate you
And I had hunger pains, only a bum could relate to
On my own, but I'm still smiling still standing
Use to pray for the pain to stop, now I only pray for understanding
I'm a changed man, me eyesight's so filthy
My heart bleeds for the world, and I don't need a critic
Or applause, see homie I'm just doing my job
I grew out of that gift and curse, I use to think it was hard
I often talk to God, and I remember the first time
On my knees holding my head, telling James and crying
Couldn't move something pulling me, don't feel like a force
See something talking, but it don't sound like a voice
Curious, and when I find out the source
See what would you do man, I had to make a choice
Listen to these words, come from a young man
So far but so close, everyone could understand
I'm not rap or hip hop, and I say it so proudly
Call me what you want, just no that I'm nobody

[Hook:  Chamillionaire - 2x]
I'm just a nobody, trying to tell everybody
About somebody, who can save anybody

[Yung Ro]
How could you look someone straight in the face, and look down on em
When God's the only one above me, he don't look down on him
Was it the drugs or my heart, that made me feel so worthless
I got a gift, and at times I don't think I deserve it
Some people think I'm perfect, I can't describe my fears
And if I cried, you wouldn't even understand my tears
Lord forgive me for my thoughts, my conscience is killing me
Cause most times when evil comes, I just go so willingly
My mind sometimes clicks, and everything sit still's
And at that moment it's so real, yet it's so unreal
Got me feeling dead already, Lord my life's so hard
Now I know, why the only thing to fear is God
A lot of things are odd, am I wrong or right
And I got them same thoughts, that made Mase turn to Christ
And I've been searching for the truth, in tears willing and hoping
Went to church still not moved, wasn't feeling the modif
Late night jamming Sam Cooke, realizing that change coming
Just can't depend on partnas, family or my woman
Find myself singing humming, to myself so proudly
See I got peace with God, even when I got nobody

[Hook - 2x]

[Yung Ro]
For 20 years I grew up, without no home
So I came up with nobody, cause I feel so alone
Many thoughts in my dome, times getting too hard
I'm starving and sinning, trying to stay close to God
Still praying to the Lord, but feeling like I'm gon crumble
Receiving test after test, and still remaining so humble
The mo' humble I stay, the mo' knowledge I gain
And the mo' knowledge I gain, the mo' I understood pain
And the mo' I understood pain, the bigger my heart grew
But hear my pain grew mo', cause now I hurt for me and you
And when you stressed and depressed, remember nobody cares
And my nigga when you feel alone, nobody's there
And my team nobody, we ain't never alone
Cause we live in nobody land, and our heart is our home
You could ask any of my niggaz, they'll tell you what's up
It's nobody to the end, because nobody gave a fuck
And nobody would bust, you think I'm playing do you
When you got nobody to worry about, cause nobody will shoot you
It's crucial my nigga, I got too much love
Remember nights on my knees, sending my praises above
Saying nobody hears me, and nobody listens
I found out nobody cares, and receive the mission
And what I thought I'd been missing, had been there the whole time
Love, support, foundation and grind
And now I'm a nobody, on a mission from heaven
To make the world feel nobody, and when I die I'll be a legend

G'yeah, to make the world feel nobody
And when I die I'll be a legend

[Hook - 2x]
