[Fruitkwan/Frukwan]
Wanna see something that could make ya sick?
Stand in front of jets on the Gaza Strip
I used to take puffs from a car, jet in my garage
Then I get blitzed from the charge
I felt my head swayin, my eyes in a daze
Felt and violence and off balance I got drugged for days
A room full of smog, I dipped it in my dart
then I threws it at my dog
I need another hit, Hurry, Quick! Hurry, Quick!
My high's takin signs and the shit's about to kick
I'm gaspin' for air, my vision dissapears,
I'm blinkin' and I'm thinkin'--Yeah!
Word, cause that's the shit I was hawkin
So stay the fuck away cuz I spit when I'm talkin
Stupid, Stupid, Stupid, Stupid Punk--
When I'm trippin'

[Chorus]

[Grym Reaper/Too Poetic]
Some people like cheeba, some like brew
I get mad lifted off four gallons of glue,
Pretty soon I spin like a top, In the middle of the room
And the shit won't stop!
Now What I see when I triiiiippppp.......
The rats in the basement all start to flip,
All through my building, from door to door,
I swear there's a fire, so I piss on the floor,
Now down the corridor was old fat Ned,
Schemin' on a blowjob from a crackhead,
He was like 'hey wanna piece little man?'
I was like 'Yo, I'm better off with my haaaannnndddd!!!!!!!'
Oh shit, reality returns,
I need another hit but the glue won't burn,
I'm cuckoo and murderous, Just plain nuts,
Smokin sodium pentathol cigarette butts, and trippin'...
and trippin'....

[Chorus]

(yo, pass it man)

[Ryzarector/The RZA]
86 on the strip, and yo' my hands was rusty
Grym Reaper, Gatekeeper, my niggaz let's get dusty
Leaky leaky, AHH, I feel the high from the stimuli
I'm like the two face, like the signs of gemini
My head keeps on spinnin', constantly continuin
Two tabs of mescaline, fucks up my adrenaline
I'm in a, uhh, I can't escape it,
It's like..uggghh....goddamit--I hate it!
So I'm hanging like a line from the grapes of a vine
The wine, it fucks up my mind, everytime,
I'm going and all I wanna be doin' is bonin
But like a dope fiend character, of Donald Goines
I'm stuck, fl-fl-flipping, sssslipping..........
I'm tripping............

Life of the-----
Can be stopped by accident
When you're tripping
(Cuz I'm trippin')</pre>
