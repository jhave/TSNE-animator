[Eazy-E]
First up high on a roof top
like a bird I'm havin' evil thoughts
a black hood covers my face
and death flows through my mind at it's own pace
sometimes I feel like a super hero
urgin' to free my kind
I'm so accurate
I shoot ya heart with a dime
now I'm back to the moral of my tale
I see a victim, and then my thoughts fail
my minds still fumblin' with the present slavery
I'm here to save you but who's to save me
I hold my strap so long that my palms all wet
I put finger on the fit and then the side a check
I make the kill here's the deal
after the trigger's pulled then the death is sealed
so it's the shots that sing out like a piper
everyones scared I'm the neighborhood sniper

[Chorus: Cold 187Um &amp; Kokane]

[Eazy-E]
So my boy is a snitch
I put my gun up to his head 
and simply scared the bitch boo
being the E ya know I'm thinkin' devious thoughts
take off ya clothes nigga and here comes a plot
his bitch was scared she made a move I pulled the trigger
now the rumors rare
now there's nothing left but a snitch
here's a four leaf clover punk make a wish
one [*Shot*] two [*Shot*] three strikes your out
This nigga is dead and now I'm lookin' for a window to get out
I made my escape the cops chase 
duckin' to an alley so they don't recognize my face
the boy had to pay the piper
so they all stayin' fair of a neighborhood sniper

[Chorus]

[Eazy-E]
I'm Doin' dirt as I continue my mission
killin' all fools as an addiction
as a E lovin' the game leavin a shame
and in my heart I feel no muthafuckin' pain
because my heart is cold as I was told
and my A.K.47 I stand bold
rippin' up shit with the fury of my gun shot
pop pop pow as I watch the muthafucka drop
lovin' the site as the blood spill
take a photograph, to keep in my hard as I was sayin' calm
and never hyper as I succeed in my mission
I be a neighborhood sniper

[Chorus]</pre>
