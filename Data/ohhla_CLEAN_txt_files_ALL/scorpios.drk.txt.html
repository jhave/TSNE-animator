[Nickelus F: speaking]
Niggas in the city hating me man they tripping
When I'm the only one that's really spittin'g
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really gripping
Why you deck(?)me up actin' like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?
 
Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop
 
[Verse: Nickelus F] 
Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbing on 
These rappers that feel a certain way but they get me yapping off
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they neega(?)
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, for prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanca from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin
That it's crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin
Nickelus F from Richmond, VA
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day
 
[Verse: Drake]
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
But compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it ain't how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artist feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
To play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, but the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, "I expected this"
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You aint Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protege, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy</pre>
