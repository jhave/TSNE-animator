[Kool Keith]
Dr. Octagon, proctologist
Lyrical scientist, you know my twist
When I release the hits
There's no one on the imitation guestlist
Organic phenomena
You feel the temperature playin with the advisor
I take the advice, opposite Mr. Nice
Owin you twice we hear it
The funkology, astrology
Lookin out the space window with the Bryants
I wear the Kobes
Not takin the space route
Duplicate me, like Moby
You don't know me

[Kool Keith]
Operation X-Factor with the Wolverine
Walkin down Broadway with the X-Men
Women close your eyes
You see the green Lost in Space ship, count to 10
The first android land here from the Mercury
Nobody on Earth shock me
Your Earth music don't hurt me
We park the bus
And grab the bag
Robot, me, comin down the street
Dr. Smith and Will Robinson and God
A baby chimpanzee with a fur coat
Speed's older brother Racer X drinkin Dom P
In the passenger seat

(Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr., Octagon)
(Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr., Octagon)
(Dr. Dr.)

[Kool Keith]
With chemicals all over my pants
The discotech will let me in the dance
Original gas computer built into my shoes reject the circumstance
A flying elephant with metal wings
Pullin up in dominoes
Me and Batman and the Rhino
Just left Spiderman smokin PCP in McDonald's
With two Asian models
Aunt Bee, Barney vibe
Just a new distribution deal, with Jive
I got a new job workin in the van
With Elmer Fudd drivin a van</pre>
