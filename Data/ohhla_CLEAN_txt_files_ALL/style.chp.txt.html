[Master P]
Yo Choppa, this P
I'm Uptown right now
I'm on my way to the Westbank to put a twist on this thing ya heard?

[Choppa]
Ooww! Oh Yea!
Ooww! Oh Yea!
Ooww! Oh Yea!
Ooowww!
Who they want?
Choppa style, chop chop Choppa style
Choppa style, chop chop
She want chop chop
She love chop chop
She want chop chop
They love chop chop

[Verse 1: Choppa]
Now I don't mean to sound rude baby or hurt you or nothing
I want an independant woman if she workin' with something
I want a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her
She ain't got a lot of ass but I can work with her
Want a big fine woman with some pop in her
She ain't got a lot of ass but titty bop with her
Now I came here to get it bump
Represent for No Limit if you ain't with it catch a dump
Now kneel it up, in the truck you know what's up
We just signed with Universal and we got the clubs up
So put your head between your legs and touch your toes
Bounce your booty up and down ooh girl there you go
Won't you walk like a ?
If you an independant woman maybe I'ma holla
You got your hair fixed nice with your clothes tight
You wanna shake it like a dog and do it all night, all night
Now swoop in position and get it right
Put your hands in the air won't you make those titties fight?
I'm Choppa chop, you know what I'm about
I wanna see you turn around and stick your booty out, your booty out

[Chorus]
Choppa style, chop chop Choppa style
Choppa style, chop chop
They want chop chop
They love chop chop
They want chop chop
They love chop chop
Choppa style, chop chop Choppa style
Choppa style, chop chop
They want chop chop
They love chop chop
They want chop chop
They love chop chop

[Verse 2: Choppa]
Hold up, check this out
I wanna know where all my ballers at
And all my independant women ya heard me?
We gonna do it like this here
This a chant, come on
If you a independant woman holla (Ooww!)
If you got your own house holla (Ooww!)
If you drive your own car holla (Ooww!)
If you hate your baby daddy holla (Ooww!)
If you an independant player holla (Oh Yea!)
If you hate your baby mamma holla (Oh Yea!)
If you drive your own car holla (Oh Yea!)
If you take care of your kids holla (Oh Yea!)
Now won't you walk with it? Walkity walk with it
Walkity walk with it, gangsta walk with it
Shakety shake with it, shakety shake with it
Shakety shake with it, shakety shake with it
Now we got a brand new dance and it just won't stop
Throw your hands in the air and do the Choppa rock
It go, chop-up-a-rock-rock-chop-a-rock
Rock-chop-up-a-rock-rock-rock y'all ready?
East Coast where you at let me get a hand clap
West Coast where you at let me get a hand clap
Mid-West where you at let me get a hand clap
Dirty South where you at let me get a hand clap

[Verse 3: Master P]
UH-OH!
Indonesia don't tease ya
I'm in the Benz with a bow-legged beaver
I likes to flip my pancakes up
And sex, I likes to give it to them rough
Big paper, all flavors
Send the word to the hood, I'm Jim Baker
Love don't cost a thing? Now who said that
Big pimpin' and ballin' who made it?
I'm in that new hummer with spinnin' wheels
And aww man, check out the grill!
Money, Gucci sandals, strip leather
I'm lookin for that ghetto Cinderella
Choppa call me up, it's off the heezy
Now we tag teamin' for sheezy
I asked her, "Boo, call me a donkey"
Cause they crush balls, I like 'em chunky

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Choppa]
Now where your head go at when you want it from the back?
Toot toot that ass up, she like it like that
Where my fellas go at when they hit it from the back?
Smack smack that ass up, she like it like that
Won't you wobble wobble move that, show me how you do that
Girl you a hood rat, make you holla "ooh yea!"
Wobble wobble move that, show me how you do that
Girl you a hood rat, make you holla "ooh yea!"
Wobble for me, come on
Won't you back it up for me, come on
Won't you wobble for me, come on
Cause you know what Choppa want, come on
It's on now nigga, we ready
I said it's on now nigga, we ready
I said it's on now nigga, we ready
I said it's on now nigga, we ready
It's on now, it's on now
It's on now, we ready
New No Limit, we ready
We ready, we ready</pre>
