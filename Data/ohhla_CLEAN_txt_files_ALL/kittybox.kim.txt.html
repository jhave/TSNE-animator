[Lil' Kim]
Yeah... honeygirl... Queen Bee
Lil' Kim... 7 you ready?  Good
Cause 7's my lucky number

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
Wanna lick get a taste of the dip, in my kitty box
Wanna play for a day dad-dy?  In my kitty box
Wanna lick get a taste of the dip, in my kitty box
Wanna play for a day dad-dy?  In my kitty box
(My kitty box, my kitty box, my kitty box, my kitty box)

[Lil' Kim]
I'm goin to Miami, stylin, whylin
Shinin, in diamonds, they're sizin me up
My bikini, Gabbana, heels, Prada
You know, I like, it sexy
Boys holla when they pass me, call me and harass me
They love me cause I'm nasty, but classy
If you're ballin put your bid in, you broke, forget it
You're just another doll chasin the Kim
I'm in heat like a cat, I'm in heat like a cat
If you want it then you better come and get it

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
Picture Lil' Kim masturbatin in a drop
Picture Lil' Kim tan and topless on a yacht
Picture Lil' Kim suckin on you like some candy
Picture Lil' Kim in your shirt and no panties
Shirt and no panties... {*moaning*}
Picture Lil' Kim in the pool skinnydippin
Picture Lil' Kim in the 69 position
Picture Lil' Kim dancin on a stripper pole
Picture Lil' Kim in a Playboy centerfold
Playboy centerfold, Playboy centerfold
Playboy centerfold, Playboy centerfold

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
Lil' Kim's got that potion, my box'll have you open
I'll drown you when I'm wet like the ocean
You crave it, you want it, you want it jump up on it
So you can play in my box 'til the morning
I'll let you play in my box 'til the morning
You can play in my box until the morning
I'm in heat like a cat, I'm in heat like a cat
If you want it then you better come and get it

[Chorus]</pre>
