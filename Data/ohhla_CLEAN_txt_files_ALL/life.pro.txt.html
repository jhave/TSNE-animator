[TV News cast]
In breaking news, seven people dead, thirty-five wounded
after another suicide bomber strikes in a bus stop in Northern Jerusalem
Breakin news, the twin towers in Manhattan have just collapsed
by being struck buy two unidentified planes 

[Dogmatic] 
Ghetto children, it's a different world
It's more scandalous everyday, but they dont really care about us 

No more picket fences, no more green grass 
No more children playing outside, no more mom and dad 
Things are different 
No more birthday gifts and good deeds that people do for nothing 
It's all about something 
Is it drugs, is it sex, is it money 
Is real life television supposed to be funny 
Yo its funny what we find to entertain ourselves 
Yo its funny how we got here and changed ourselves 
Are we going to hell or are we already here 
Locked down in the cell with 10 tattooed tears niggas 
Swallow your fears, we in the present building a future 
Can't go back to yesterday, now I gots to shoot ya 
They say its politics, but the streets shit to me 
'Its All About Politics' you cant tell that shit to a G 
Nigga please my dogs aint eatin, we in the trenches 
With dauphins killers, haters and scandalous bitches 

[Proof] 
My mind has a foul (?), the problem son 
Watch the preacher preach and eating gobble swan 
I was fine until daddy bust 
It was all family love,fuck and daddy's nuts 
But mama had to push, dropped me ten-two 
Now i bear with this watch the evil men do 
Aint no (?) oppertunity 
Its like theres only one plan that gots to role with me 
Minority crisis to fight this stock exchange 
While you flood out blocks with caine for pocket change 
The illest sight of my life, a cracked head with morning sickness 
Tell me why the baby gotta be born addicted 
In this cold world with sin drives and daylight 
How the fuck we got gay rights than have slave rights 
Today might be my last 
(?) might see my ass 
The first straight (?) they think i hate fags 
I dont hate fags, i just hate people 
That break equal ties, make secret lies 
Like I slept through one night, my life was dead wrong 
Surrounded by internet perverts and kid porn 
My shits warm and now I'm pissing hot 
Kids get popped by all these twisted cops 
Fuck when this shit gonna stop, in the days of truth 
Jumping of the highest roof trying to save the youth 

[Hook] x2
Murdering human beings, no regards for anything 
Dope fiends, coke kings, neighbourhood (?) 
Open me, close me, oh please hold me 
Daddy didn't want me, Mamma never told me 


[King Gordy] 
Karosene heaters heat the house up 
Borrowing water from my neighbours just so I can wash up 
Using candles to see my way through the crib 
Its eight of us thats the way that we live 
Cant tell you when i last ate a meal 
Stomach growling, nigga hungry than a motherfucker 
Mamma's out smoking, please put some groceries in this motherfucker 
Thats why i chill at crack houses and get rapped 
They push some weight, I make a hundred fucking dollars a day 
That go blunts, King Gordy
I just cant take it living bare naked sleeping with a scarf
(????) three blankets
Hoping police raid us, take us away 
I wait for the day, to have a warm place for us to stay 
Now I've been shot at, beat the fuck down (?)
I even cocked back (???) 
I'm from the ghetto, unemployed, dropped out at age eleven 
With a wife and three kids, ah shit I'm James Evans 

[Hook] x2
Murdering human beings, no regards for anything
