[Chorus]
All these lonely girls wanna fuck...It's OK 
That's alright girl, that's ok 
That's alright girl, that's ok 
Keep callin me and beggin me and blowin me up...It's OK 
That's alright girl, that's ok 
That's alright girl, that's ok 

[Slimm]
My game, slicker than slow tongue 
Get yo' main hoe sprung 
Chokin' on my blowgun 
She swallowed all my bubble gum 
Said it was so yum yum 
All off in her tum tum 
Playboy you think dumb dumb 
Now what? Uh huh 
Last night, I was in them guts 
Uh huh 
A young playa cut yo' what? 
Uh huh 
She was tryin' to get a nut 
Uh huh 
And we gon' meet back at the hut 
Uh huh 
Come on 

[Chorus] 

[Slimm]
A-town, late nights 
I'm off in 112, posted up as usual downstairs 
With a couple of clydesdales 
Sippin zippindale 
Got a sack of good, take a whiff, inhale 
Blaze up, hate to ball and bail 
Got some late cut, she sure now how to shake her tail 
The way I hit it, make her wanna break up 
And leave her man, make up 
And cheat again, caked her 
Lay low, Comfort Inn, tucked her in
Next week she said she'll bring a friend 
Come on 

[Chorus] 

[Andre]
Said I love my man, man man man 
We got our ups and downs and I'll get lonely and, and and and 
Wanna move move to someone who might understand, stand stand stand 
How to make a girl feel like Alice in Wonderland...wonderland...wanderin' 
Wonderin'...if she can home with guilt on her mind 
Really all she truly wants to know is that she still fine 
After they do better, better tell her, 'fo another fella 
Better, get, sit sit, shit shit, spit spit, hit hit 

[Chorus]</pre>
