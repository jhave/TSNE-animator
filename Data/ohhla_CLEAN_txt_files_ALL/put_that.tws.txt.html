man
I got to figure out something to do
to get this nigga back in my life for real
put something on

then you put it down on me
you ain't even have to do me like that
the you stop calling me
he believes power me or something dam

everday and everynight all I wanna do is see you
figure out how to be near you
doing the things you do
you stay all day is to me
all night is to me and you really made me feel good
you put that thang down on me thang down on me and I really knew you could
I took the baretta that you knew that what to do with a girl like me
you worked my body and turned it inside out fullfilled all my fantasy's
you worked that hump on ya back
lay me on my back broke down and did the oooo
then you stopped calling me and I don't know what to do cuz baby you

(chorus) 2x
you put that thang on me
the one that makes me love for you
and you put it down on me
and I only wanna be with you
but then you stop calling me
I don't know what to say or do
I got to figure out what to do just to get back up with you

everyday I'm hoping then I pray that one day
you come back and bring your love my way
I'm talking everynight I sit and wonder why
now baby you put it on me but now you don't want me
tell me what I got to do what I got to prove show my love to you
I'll do whatever to get one more night cuz I'm craving for me some you

and I thought everything was cool
