(Niccademus)
Woo
Yo

(Twista)
Do you really wanna ride with me and my nigga 
tippin' flickin' through cities 
and never where we slow down

(Niccademus)
Come on
Ah Ah
Ah Ah
Nic Don

(Twista)
Do you really wanna ball with me and my nigga 
tippin' flickin' through cities 
and never where we slow down

(Niccademus)
I was dirty south
Ever since it start with my shiny mouth
I make the whole crowd part what you talkin' bout
Step up in the club baby turn it out 
Them hater's get no love yo without a doubt
Hey whats that smell
Smokin' on a hot dub from A-T-L, whoa
Bitches in the back countin' my money
My two way off the hook cos everythang for sale
And it don't matter to me
Slangin' in the studio or out in the streets 
without a motherfuckin' cap on my salary
So iced out cornered in the breeze 
coat chillin' in the place to be 
And they ain't ready for me
What ya'll thought
45 G's up for a key and a boat, yo
Niccademus stayin' down to ride
I want whatever me and Twista bout to get it fo sho, yo

(chorus) (Niccademus)
Yo we can do it but it really don't matter to me
Said we can do it but it really don't matter to me
Said we can do it but it really don't matter to me

(Twista)
Do you really wanna ride with me and my nigga 
tippin' flickin' through cities 
and never where we slow down

(Niccademus)
But it really don't matter to me
Said we can do it but it really don't matter to me
Said we can do it but it really don't matter to me

(Twista)
Do you really wanna ball with me and my nigga 
tippin' flickin' through cities 
and never where we slow down

(Niccademus)
What

(Twista)
It really don't matter to me either as long as the weeds purple
fiendss in my circle so be when I hurt you
It ain't shit to see us
Hoe niggas go and get your heata's
Ain't no fuckin' with Twista and Niccademus ya'll some mistameena's
I don't bail better through the city of 50-60 
in the pocket next to the sticky sippin' on Mickie's
On a money mission
While peoples eyes takin' pictures 
rollin' swisser's hollin' at bitches thick as boa constrictors
Blaze all that hash sure
Screamin' show me baby what you got that ass for
Come and get with real niggas that'll pull it
Murderers poppin' mo' 
Tryin' to double it off with dro with 55 hata's blow
Hata's how you gonna care
Handlin' and countin' hundreds
Or freak on it while we get blunted or get them thangs a gunnin'
It really don't matter to us
T and Nic Don 
We step on competition and empty the clips gone

(chorus)

(Niccademus)
It really don't matter to me
From the Chi-Town all the way over to S.C.
From the dirty Bama up to Milwuakee
Niggas ride candy with 20 inch D's
Spend a whole sack at the bar hoe please
Call my homie B and he be hittin' it with mo' cheese
Thug got takin' your bitches and steady stackin' more riches 
now throw your hands up for street B
Everybody feel me raise it up
Twist up another burner of stick-a-green blaze it up
They on the floor now
Tell me do you wanna ride with me and my nigga balla 
post speed and we never gonna slow down, oh
It don't even matter yo 
Smoked out with Twist in the studio
I spit a mothafuckin' tone on the microphone
Have 'em screamin' Nic Don nigga ready to go, oh

(chorus) 2x</pre>
