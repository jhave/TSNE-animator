Artist: Cage
Album:  The Best and Worst of Cage (Mixtape)
Song:   Underground Rapstar
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Every rapper in the house, shut the fuck up
Every rapper in the house, shut the fuck up
Every rapper in the house, shut the fuck up
Don't go against the weathermen...
You gonna get fucked up...

And I ain't fucked up now bluffin' the basics
Let stuff in the Asics from that kid huffin the matrix
I let my brain cells fight it out and throw the lighter out
You ain't even got hands to hold the guns you write about
Ain't got a heater and why Cage need more than 4 fists?
I stay puttin it down and don't come off this...
Complice not needed spray dolo
With more letter combinations in my blood than K Solo
LSD, THC, PCP, the only three I need left is GED
You know you can't stand the manic
Even if you don't get the picture the point of view's still panoramic
Chemical organic, leaf is clouding
Get your contact back in in 3 plus two thousand

[Chorus]
This is Federal hate the dead are awake the medical's great
This is the life of a underground rapstar
Get lots of brain but the birds are vain and peck at anything
This is the life of a underground rapstar
You spit it you bit it and then you got your car kitted, you get it?
This is the life of a underground rapstar
Travel on somebody else's dime and can still pull out the nine
This is the life of a underground rapstar

This is my brain on drugs these are the drugs on my brain
I stab the shit out of Clyde just like I bludgeoned his dame
After I fucked her insane...
That sex pistol got a chest to spray
[?] the fuck?
You think my identity was born yesterday?
Been the prince elite since the purple rain was in the street
I parted the projects for that sea of sulphur you seek
And if bein by my gun matched the drink in my glass
This incredible ho, lick on her incredible ass
Lick with care, Snake Pliskin drift in and tear off
Escape from New York and come back when the 'shish wear off
Personality pair off til my skin frays
Been off for ten days feel like two still light blue
The blast Ferarri bed
Ain't forgivin a ho for givin' up sorry head
Vintage electronic and Barbie wed
Label's try to hype you up like you goin' fight Royce
Like Def Jam fucked around and signed the wrong white boy

[Chorus]
This is Federal hate the dead are awake the medical's great
This is the life of a underground rapstar
Get lots of brain but the birds are vain and peck at anything
This is the life of a underground rapstar
You spit it you bit it and then you got your car kitted, you get it?
This is the life of a underground rapstar
Travel on somebody else's dime and can still pull out the nine
This is the life of a underground rapstar
This is the life of a underground rapstar
This is the life of a underground rapstar
This is the life of a underground rapstar
This is the life of a underground rapstar
