[Hook - repeat 4x] 
Do ya niggas want a war wit us 
Do ya niggas want to get your head bust 
I see them yorks in the sky raise em high raise em high 
I see them tones in the sky raise em high raise em high 

[Juicy J] 
Yeah every time I flip the script 
Niggas always talkin shit 
Mad beacuase the cards I flip 
Maybe he be struckin wit 
I think he used to slang them rocks 
Set up shop on this here block 
Orange Bloosm apartment three 
Niggas ain't even know me 
Young and buck just full of beer 
Drinking out my nigga Clair 
Death is like we naver fear 
Even if we know it's near 
Stealing cars and rollin dice 
Trying to dodge the Memphis vice 
I'm telling all you young niggas 
In this game there ain't no life 
Mom told mo to stay in school 
All I did was break the rules 
Pop was preaching the word of God 
I was busy actin' a fool 
Mad with a fuckin  mug 
Loadin' up my 38 slug 
Head spinnin' from the killing 
And head full with nothin' but drugs 

[Crunchy Blac] 
Do ya'll niggas want a war wit us 
Do ya'll niggas want a war wit us 
In gats we trust 
In heads we bust 
See nigaas like us 
Uh uh we can't be trust 
We come to your crib 
I mean we come to your house 
We knock on your door 
We put the gun in your mouth 
We throw our sets 
No disrespect 
All we want is money nigga 
Can you niggas get met 
No game I play 
Wit none of you hoes 
Like the one in the chamber 
Puttin bodies in holes

[DJ Paul] 
Now when they finally gonna learn about the Hav it's on 
When these hip crisp niggas kick a hole in your door 
Now bitch it's on cuz you fuvkin' with niggas that's strong 
You damn near gone cuz I'm buckin' you bitches with tones 
Never alone hoe I run with Triple Sizzix 
No full clips hoe I'n leavein' them off in your chest 
Can't waste no time cuz cuz I'm droppin' them dimes 
That's why the Hypnatize is all about droppin' them nines 
Up in your face you bitches are fake 
I got some boys they ain't gay 
But they knowin' to rape 
A little cock sucka like you 
Cuz I despite you 
If you can't beat em' 
You join the right crew 
HCP nigga HCP nigga 
HCP Hypnatize Camp Posse nigga 

[La Chat] 
Back up shit

Don't want to go to war wit us 
We got a sniper to get ya 
Hypnatize you ain't heard 
We down for whatever 
We buckin' bitches 
Fuck you hoes 
Cuz you ain't on our level 
La Chat I clicked up with the right camp 
ready to ride 
You fuck wit one 
You fuck wit all 
We ain't scared to die 
And we ain't scared to kill a nigga 
On the pain we deliver 
We chop you up 
Don't give a fuck 
And throw your ass in the river 
I know you bitches know it on 
When you fuck wit the click 
I know you bitches know you gone 
Whe you violate this shit

Cuz that anna we handle yeah
