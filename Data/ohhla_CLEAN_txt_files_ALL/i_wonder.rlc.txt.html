[Intro: Reef the Lost Cauze]
Sometimes I wonder
Reef the Lost Cauze, Marco Polo~!
Yeah {*"I wonder..."*} live from Brooklyn, New York City
As you all know I call Philadelphia home {*"I wonder..."*}
I'm out here with my man
We used to zone in this shit knahmsayin?
{*"I wonder..."*} Just buildin in this fuckin world
I got to thinkin, man I just, I just wanna say this shit
{*"I wonder..."*} yo

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Deep in the mind, is where I'm soulseekin you'll find
I smoke reefer recline and let the streets intertwine
With the beats I rewind, no sleep I can find
I pause examine walls that I'm eager to climb
All you seein is crime, hella high water rise
You'll drown homeboy, you can't compete with the tide
You can't see it like it's sleep in your eyes, how a weasel despise
I made clay out of the feeblest minds
I wonder how evil could thrive
I wonder how in these last days all my people survive
Reef is alive, screamin from the hilltops
I'm from Hilltop, a nigga still box for lock like a skilled boxer
We keep the meals hot, sometimes you'd have to streal pots
I wonder does that make me a thief, I will not
allow them, to take up my space
I wonder how many rappers would die without MySpace
I wonder

[Chorus]
My mind gets to roamin and my mouth gets to openin
{*"I wonder..."*} when the madness gon' stop out here
It's getting wild out here, they lickin shots out here
Crooked cops set us up and get knocked out here
When my mind gets to roamin, my mouth gets to openin
{*"I wonder..."*} when the madness gon' stop out here
It's gettin wild out here, they lickin shots out here
No education, ain't no jobs out here

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Aiyyo I wonder why we still overseas
Is it cause we care about Iraqis? Is it oil and greed?
I wonder what they do with our cheese
They raise money for research, but never cure no disease
I wonder why they fuckin with me for puffin my trees
But drunks still get trashed and, handed they keys
in the ignition, listen this mean somethin to me
So I wonder what make a rapper claim he's not a emcee
See I write for dead homies and my brothers in streets
My peoples, my mother, and my baby mother-to-be
So no I don't respect a nigga who spit nuttin but ki's
I wonder if these kids know it ain't just hustlin schemes
You sell coke? We need to be discussing they dreams
Young boss said it's nothin cause I'm fuckin with D
I looked him dead in his face so our eyes could meet
and asked him what he really want his life to be
He said, I wonder

[Chorus]

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Is this all about ice and gems?
I wonder where does your soul go when your life should end
Do you come back as a Maybach? Maybe a Rolls Royce
I wonder how many kids I'd have if not for pro-choice
I had no voice, until the beat came
I wonder how many black men in America these streets claimed
Enough to fill the NFL with like three teams
I wonder why they glamorize the shit when they should seek change
I wonder what my friend's mom felt
When she had to identify his body, and could not tell
if that was him or not cause they filled his top with a million shots
Fuck you fake thug niggaz dog, this is the block
I wonder what happened to this music of hip and hop
Now it's fizzle pop, so don't wonder when your shit just flop
I wonder why you go to jail, unless you is a cop
I wonder who killed Malcolm and Martin as much as Big and 'Pac

[Chorus]

[Outro: Reef the Lost Cauze]
