Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Check my Visa, check my check my Visa
Check my Visa, check my check my Visa
Check my Visa, check my check my Visa
Check my Visa, check my check my Visa

Baby I'm on my way to see ya
I drink whiskey not tequila
Tell me one place in the world that you've never been
'Cause they just gave me my Visa

On the TFB but baby you can call me fly
'Cause I eat these broads, I got the pterodactyl in the sky
And my baby's always popping cause they wanna say hi
Tell em I don't kiss and talk, it's the boys  I make 'em cry

I'm a crazy ass bitch from the UK
Straight from London to LA
But the shovel coming up and I was okay
Cause I know I'm gon be with it at the end of the day

I push it to the max,
I go hard, you better ask
Keep your change up in your pocket
Pick you up, my amo tess

Take you away with me, come let me put you on
Show you my world
Check my Visa, check my check my...

Just come and play with me, don't mean no play
I'll take ya around the world
Check my Visa, check my check my...

I just want you baby

Check my Visa, check my check my Visa
Check my Visa, check my check my Visa
Check my Visa, check my check my Visa

Check my Visa, I be flashing it whenever broads wanna see it
See the definition of a jet, say I rough and beat it
I don't hold a homie back and I'm telling him move free
I'm a special, carry a little cash out
Leaning in the club when I'm there to get in the show
The show the show the show the show
Get the green bees up in the sewer, forgot the blackout
Right back out, right back in
Right round for the fly bomb catching
On the A list, got the racking
With stars, don't stop stacking

I push it to the max,
I go hard, you better ask
Keep your change up in your pocket
Pick you up, my amo tess

Take you away with me, come let me put you on
Show you my world
Check my Visa, check my check my...

Just come and play with me, don't mean no play
I'll take ya around the world
Check my Visa, check my check my...

I just want you baby

Up up and away now ah ah
Take you high like Mary J now
Let the world be our playground
I just want you baby

Buss a jack, let me sign it ah ah
Easy get to the private ah ah
Take you to another climate
I just want you baby

Take you away with me, come let me put you on
Show you my world
Check my Visa, check my check my...

Just come and play with me, don't mean no play
I'll take ya around the world
Check my Visa, check my check my...

I just want you baby

Take you away with me, come let me put you on
Show you my world
Check my Visa, check my check my...

Just come and play with me, don't mean no play
I'll take ya around the world
Check my Visa, check my check my...

I just want you baby</pre>
