Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Rihanna]
Feel it comin' in the air; hear the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill; it's a dangerous love affair
Can't be scared when it goes down; got a problem tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind, is who's gonna run this town tonight?
Is who's gonna run this town tonight?
We gonna run this town

[Jay-Z - over Intro]
Yeah, yeah, I'm ready, whassup!
C'mon! Whassup! Whassup! Whassup!
Yeah, whassup! Yeah..

[Jay-Z]
We are; yeah, I said it: we are
This is Roc Nation: pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is La Familia, I'll explain later
But for now let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeroes, dot zero, here Doug
Back to running' circles round niggas now we squared up, hold up!

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Life's a game but it's not fair; I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doing my own thing, walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile; almost there don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind, is who's gonna run this town tonight?
Heyyyyyyyyyyy, heyyyyyyy-ayyyy-ayy-ayy
Heyyyyyyyyyyy, heyyyyyyy-ayyyy-ayy-ayy
Who's gonna run this town tonight?

[Jay-Z - over Chorus]
Yeah, uh-huh.. whassup!
Whassup! Whassup! Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whassup!

[Jay-Z]
We are; yeah, I said it: we are
You can call me Caesar, in a dark Czar
Please follow the leader, so Eric B we are
Microphone fiend, this the return of the God - peace, God
(Ahh, ahh) it ain't no nobody fresher
I'm in, Maison, uh, Martin Margiela
On the table screamin' "fuck the other side, they're jealous!"
We got a banquette full of broads, they got a table full of fellas
EWW! And they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw their hand in cause they ain't got no spades
EWW! My whole team got dough
So my banquette is looking like millionaires' row
EWW!

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z - over Chorus]
Whassup! Uh, uh, chea, chea, chea
Whassup! Only, thing, that, my, mind, who, uh, whassup!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.. whassup!

[Kanye West]
Uh, yeah..
It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow
to everybody on your dick -- no homo
I bought my whole family whips -  no Volvos
Next time I'm in church, please: no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that, everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for to push a fuckin' Rav 4?!
But I know that if I stay stuntin'
All these girls only gonna want one thing
I can spend my whole life +Good Will Hunting+
Only good gonna come is it's good when I'm cummin'
She got an ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, uh, 2 bee stings
And I'm beasting, off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just trying to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
"What's that, Ye?" "Baby, these heels"
"Is that a May-WHAT~ !!" "Baby, these wheels"
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feeling like you run it, huh? Now you know how we feel

[Outro: Rihanna] + (Jay-Z)
(Whassup!) Heyyyyyyyyyyy, heyyyyyyy-ayyyy-ayy-ayy
(Yeah, yeah) Heyyyyyyyyyyy, heyyyyyyy-ayyyy-ayy-ayy
(Whassup!) Heyyyyyyyyeeeeeah, heyyyyy-ayyy-ayy-ayyeah
Heyyyyyyyyyyy - we gonna run this town tonight...
(Whassup!)</pre>
