[Intro]
I feel it... I feel it...
This a public service announcement

[Mannie Fresh]
Once upon time in this place called club
Met this cutie with big bootie so I gave that girl a dub
Later on that night we had plans and shit
If you take me from the club then I'm gonna let you hit
If I take you from the club will you always be in love?
And you promise to love no other man? (I do)
See she looked me in my face put her hands up on my waist
And said "Yes baby this I understand"
Now my life is like happy, bout to be a pappy
And it's all because of my girl
But just, then, this nigga walked in
And what he said fucked up my whole world
He said my, bitch, and your, bitch been freakin each other
I, had, relations with your bitch and I didn't use a rubber
My blood rushed down and my heart touched the ground
Felt like somebody stabbed me with a knife
Now I look at what I done, somebody get my gun
Can't change a hoe to a housewife (ya see?)

[Chorus]
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Will make you kill them, if it wasn't for the children
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Will make you kill them, better leave the building
