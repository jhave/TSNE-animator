[Chorus: Lyfe]
Woke up screaming fuck the world today I, had it up to here
Ex-girlfriend got custody today cause, they say she feels
that I'll never be the daddy that she, wants me to be
Hardest thing I've ever had to do, sayin bye to my seeds, ohhh
 
[Chorus] w/ ad libs
 
[Young Buck]
Damn, look at what I call my life, a glock-9
And a eightball of white, I got mine
Well, not quite, I got signed
And 50 put me right in the light, it took time
Meanwhile I'm livin the life
Where a nigga just might see prison tonight
My rent due, baby need food and shoes
I'm flat broke, still I refuse to lose
So I smoke, lookin for the fools with jewels
I'm 'bout to see if it's true what a uzi do
Nobody cares, and life ain't fair or free
The best thang you can do is say a prayer for me
And how dare, y'all try to lock me up
You not here, so you ain't really givin a fuck
But I swear, as long as I'm breathin, I'm hustlin
I'm thuggin, and this is the reason because I
 
[Chorus]
 
[Lyfe]
If you see me in a suit and tie (in a suit and tie)
Tell all my niggaz goodbye (tell my niggaz goodbye)
Tell 'em that I'm on my wayyyyy (tell 'em I'm on my way man)
Say a prayer for me and hug the kids (hug the kids)
Tell God all of the shit I did (the shit I did)
And how the kids looked up to me (cause they did look up to me nigga!)
Yeahhhh
 
[Young Buck]
Heyyy  holla if you feel my pain
I been to hell and back, and I'm still the same
The block hotter than flames, but we sell the 'caine
Puttin all kind of thangs in our baby's name
Tell the hoes "I'm rich bitch" like my name Rick James
I really ain't got shit, but I can't complain
Cause L.T. got life, and Big Ju got fifty
Jimmy did his ten and D doin his twenty
Come get me, seems like it's no way out
So when I say "Dirty," you say "South"
Tryin to put my hands on somethin, brush off my shoulders
Buy up some land or somethin, get what they owe us
You don't have a plan, you're nuttin is what they told us
Remember what the O.G.'s showed to the soldiers
Gotta make it to heaven or die tryin to get it
The day dude fuck with Dre, I was feelin like
