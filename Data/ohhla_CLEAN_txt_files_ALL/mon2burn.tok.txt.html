Song:   Money 2 Burn
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Just got paid and
I got a little money to burn
I gotta get laid
Gotta find me a sexy girl

So me say hey pretty baby
Wanna ask you yuh name
I like the way u groove
I hope you feelin da same
Got me attracted to
The shape and ya frame
Let me introduce you to
My group and my flame?
Don't get it twisted
I'm just bein blane
Wanna save ya mind
With lyrics and
Get in ya veins
If u got the tunnel
Here comes the train
Baby let me know if you're
Down with my game Cuz I

Just got paid and
I got a little money to burn
I gotta get laid
Gotta find me a sexy girl

I see you walkin by
Gul ya lookin so fine
Try to stop you in ya tracks
And tell you whats on my mind
It no matta if you neglect me
One more time
Cuz before the night done
Baby girl you'll be mine
You have two mountains
I wanna climb
I wanna take you back home
And test ya waistline
A one night stand girl
Is not a crime
Cuz if you do it real good
It can last a lifetime

Just got paid and
I got a little money to burn
I gotta get laid
Gotta find me a sexy girl

? Are u down for whateva
Lets get together
Girl no matter the weather
Things gonna be better
I gotta lot of cheddar
? love to get you redder
Remember when i said u
Get ya groove back like Stella
Hey Cinderella
Cute Punchanella
I'm a jolly good fella
Would diss you like neva
Birds of a feather
Together Forever
Some nah have a netta?
Whateva

Just got paid and
I got a little money to burn
I gotta get laid
Gotta find me a sexy girl

So me say hey pretty baby
Wanna ask you yuh name
I like the way u groove
I hope you feelin da same
Got me attracted to
The shape and ya frame
Let me introduce you to
My group and my flame?
Don't get it twisted
I'm just bein blane
Wanna save ya mind
With lyrics and
Get in ya veins
If u got the tunnel
Here comes the train
Baby let me know if you're
Down with my game Cuz I

Just got paid and
I got a little money to burn
I gotta get laid
Gotta find me a sexy girl

Just got paid and
I got a little money to burn
I gotta get laid
Gotta find me a sexy girl</pre>
