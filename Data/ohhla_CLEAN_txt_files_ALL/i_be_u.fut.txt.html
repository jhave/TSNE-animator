[Verse 1]
Thinkin' how you would be thinkin' of feeling you close
I'm dreamin' how you would be dreamin' and hoping you over
I give what you give and I never back out of decisions
I feel what you feel and I'm hoping and prayin' and willing
I'm nervous you nervous you drinkin' I'm drinkin' we rockin'
I'm talkin' you talkin' I'm in it you in it, no stopping
I'm quiet you quiet we sit here, we looking in silence

[Chorus]
I'll be there I'll be there I'll be
I'll be there I'll be there I'll be
I'll be you baby I'll be you baby I'll be you
And I might came through, what you do
But I'll be I said I'll be there

[Verse 2]
You workin' I'm workin'
I get that coffin and kill that pussy in Venice
Yeah, You sweatin' I'm sweatin'
We overdoing the mollys, won't let us finish
Yeah, I need it you need it
And we both fiendin' I guess that's our agreement
I'm naked, you naked
And neither one of us tryna look for a blanket
Got questions on questions about what answers I know
Because when we're drinkin'
Your spirit my spirit illuminates through our bodies
I feel we whole
Eye contact exchanging favors, I guess it's better to know you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'll be there I'll be there I'll be there
I'll be you baby, I see you baby
I see you in the morning, I see you in the evening
I see you in the nighttime when I thought I was creepin'
I see you baby
I'll be you baby
And I was sittin' at home lonely wishing you was here
Now I'm thinkin' to myself "Why I ain't already leave yet?"
I see you baby
I'll be you baby
I see you in the morning, I see you in the evening
I see you in the nighttime when I thought I was creepin'
I see you baby</pre>
