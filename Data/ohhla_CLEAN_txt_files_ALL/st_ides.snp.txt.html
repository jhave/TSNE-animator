Just Hit the Corner store,
You know what I'm looking for
St Ides
Just Hit the Corner store,
You know what I'm looking for
St Ides

[Snoop Dogg]
I tip toe
Through the door with a box of 40s
Party just to bounce
And house full of hoes
No set trippin
Just sipping on S.T.
That's how we do it in the L.B.C.
Here ye, here ye
Come one come all
It's the first annual g nigg
And all my dogs
Are invited so go on and light it
Cause it's the first time in a longtime
And I just might
Reminisce about the fresh vest
Back in '85
When the dub and the zaniaks used to Hoo Ride
It was easy just to serve on the curve that's how I do
Ain't no slippin, dippin
Now I'm sipping on my brew
Staying true cause now I'm supposed to
Grab my little friend
Then my deuce deuce
I gets lose with my hands on my drinks
L.B.C. I see money in the bank
