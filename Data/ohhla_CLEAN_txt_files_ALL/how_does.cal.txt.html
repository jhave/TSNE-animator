[Koffee Brown]
Hey Hey
Heey-heeayy

[Verse 1: Coo Coo Cal]
Can you picture this?
It's bout that time we got the tunes
Hot on the block sippin' on 'yac like some damn fools
Consumin' liquor by the ounce
Ya guys is rollin' up to get their grub on,
wit the dubs on and the car that bounce
Help at the park, barbaques wit roasted pig
And can nobody eat until the meat is done and we feed the kids
Nieces, nephews, uncles and aunties
Yea, you ride wit plenty of folks but ain't got nothin' up on these
Seeds from the weed, up out the bangs of optimos
A bunch of pimps, playas, and hustlaz to fock the hoes
Pros comin' off, when the barbaques done
ain't really focus on that, but hell a playa bound to get some
Kids runnin' back-and-fourth cryin' on who pushed them now
We all fam, but I be damned if they push my seat down
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

[Chorus:1x] *background chorus vocals - Koffee Brown
How does it feel to ya
Roll up the Swisher baby if it's real to ya
Gangstas, where we from (?) to ya
Leg breakin', cake bakin', is it trill to ya
How does it feel to ya
That's how we do it
Hop in the heavy Chevy, corner bend to it
Shine up the candy and the twenty-twins to it
Get drunk, fill up your cup again to it
How does it feel to ya...feel me now

[Hook: B-12]
M-dub, three thugs sittin' on duece dueces
Hennessy and gin, need some orange and apple juices
barbaques and half-ounce, bounce wit the music
Wide-identical pipes (?) wit dukeys

[Verse 2: Coo Coo Cal]
Midwest is the timezone
When it gets hot,
We go block-to-block, open up shop, and get our grind on
Now I ain't lyin' homes to whoever make a playa change
To release the tension, mention basketball and play a game
Wit dames on the sideline cheerin' you on
And haters that can't play on the side while,
cryin' foul, screwin' you on
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

[Chorus:1x] *background chorus vocals - Koffee Brown
How does it feel to ya
Roll up the Swisher baby if it's real to ya
Gangstas, where we from (?) to ya
Leg breakin', cake bakin', is it trill to ya
How does it feel to ya
That's how we do it
Hop in the heavy Chevy, corner bend to it
Shine up the candy and the twenty-twins to it
Get drunk, fill up your cup again to it
How does it feel to ya...feel me now

[Verse 3: Coo Coo Cal]
Can you picture this?
A bunch of bawlaz ride oldschools
A lot of them cut the top, hookin' up decks and sounds to roll to
It ain't the old two-hundred twenty twins
Mack-10, boss jackin' at the lakefront in the city I'm in
Bendin' corners in an orderly fashion
Twenty cars deep,
creepin' up the street, beatin' dawg so it be mashin'
Flashin' bread at them chickenhead
Yea they jumpin' in to sin dawg,
cuz-it's-about the only thing that'll get 'em fed
Hear what I just said
Pick 'em up in the presidental rento limo, TV's and (?)
Ghetto celeb is the gear we wear
Naw ya'll don't hear it there
But by the end of this year you gonna feel the player
Sippin' on Henn, and Cris is gettin' plenty drunk
Which switches from the candy-coupe dawg, an empty front
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

[Chorus:1x] *background chorus vocals - Koffee Brown
How does it feel to ya
Roll up the Swisher baby if it's real to ya
Gangstas, where we from (?) to ya
Leg breakin', cake bakin', is it trill to ya
How does it feel to ya
That's how we do it
Hop in the heavy Chevy, corner bend to it
Shine up the candy and the twenty-twins to it
Get drunk, fill up your cup again to it
How does it feel to ya...feel me now

[Hook: B-12]
M-dub, three thugs sittin' on duece dueces
Hennessy and gin, need some orange and apple juices
barbaques and half-ounce, bounce wit the music
Wide-identical pipes (?) wit dukeys

[Chorus:1x] *background chorus vocals - Koffee Brown
How does it feel to ya
Roll up the Swisher baby if it's real to ya
Gangstas, where we from (?) to ya
Leg breakin', cake bakin', is it trill to ya
How does it feel to ya
That's how we do it
Hop in the heavy Chevy, corner bend to it
Shine up the candy and the twenty-twins to it
Get drunk, fill up your cup again to it
How does it feel to ya...feel me now
