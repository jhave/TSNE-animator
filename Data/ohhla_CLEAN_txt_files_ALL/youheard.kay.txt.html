[Intro: Sheek Louch]
StreetSweepers!!!! Kay Slay!!! D-Block!!!
Uh! You got 'em with this fam!
Check me out yo, uh!

[Verse One: Sheek Louch]
We get it poppin homey (Yeah) Bottles poppin homey (Yeah)
Piff burnin homey (Yeah) Your baby mama on me (WOOOOOOO!!!)
Jewelry drippin, Yankee hat over my face, about a seventeen shot on my waist
Nothin in my ear (Uh Uh) But it's a G5 in the air
we spend that from here to there (No doubt)
Big money on the floor, dice game four or more
Tucked underneath the tee, hammer in the other vee
I'm StreetSweepin on the Deegan with this Puerto Rican mami 
Long hair, the pussy like tsunami
Gucci's on, hoodie over, tell them playas game is over
Soon as I step in the club they like.....(HO!!!)

[Chorus: Ray J]
Yeah I know you heard of us, the murderous, most shady
D-Block, Ray J you better watch your lady
We pop bottles in the club on the daily
And I buss a nigga head if he ever try to play me
Yeah I know you heard of us, the murderous, most shady
D-Block, Ray J you better watch your lady
We pop bottles in the club on the daily
And I buss a nigga head if he ever try to play me

[Verse Two: Styles P]
Blue Yankee, white tee and some Polos (uniform)
Never seen a gangster, take a photo (SNAP IT!)
With D-Block, that's a no-no (uh-uh!), just made a boo-boo
Crazy, the 380 will make a nigga doo-doo (CRAZY!!)
Waddup to my niggas lock down playin Kay Slay
Yay on the check, cash aligned on payday
(Y'know) Forever whylin (ever), forever stylin
Either in jail or a island for a big day (Either or)
Y'know the same shit, different toilet
I can't call it outside with the smoke heads and alcoholics (Outside)
Me and Sheek nigga, (Waddup?) where the beef, nigga?
Year to year money, bustin heat - ONE!!

[Chorus: Ray J]
Yeah I know you heard of us, the murderous, most shady
D-Block, Ray J you better watch your lady
We pop bottles in the club on the daily
And I buss a nigga head if he ever try to play me
Yeah I know you heard of us, the murderous, most shady
D-Block, Ray J you better watch your lady
We pop bottles in the club on the daily
And I buss a nigga head if he ever try to play me

[Verse Three: Sheek Louch]
Geah...the yeay and the pot, the weed and the dutch
The safety off, plate in my mouth, you will get touched
I don't wait for music money, it's too slow (no doubt)
I hit the block and make what you get for a show (ha ha!)
It's jewelry and riches, hammer got him strippin
like Kay Slay bitches (SLAY!), you better pictures 

[Verse Four: Styles P]
Go 'head and get you a snapshot 
(SNAP-ROB) for you jewelry, your crack rocks
Right on the back block (GET ROBBED!!)
D-Block, we got shit, (D-BLOCK!) used to be have-nots
You can ask Kay Slay, we stay in the projects like J.J.
Shoot dope in you like muthafuckin Ray Ray
Everyday is payday!

[Chorus: Ray J]
Yeah I know you heard of us, the murderous, most shady
D-Block, Ray J you better watch your lady
We pop bottles in the club on the daily
And I buss a nigga head if he ever try to play me
Yeah I know you heard of us, the murderous, most shady
D-Block, Ray J you better watch your lady
We pop bottles in the club on the daily
And I buss a nigga head if he ever try to play me

[Bridge: Ray J]
I'm on the yacht wit my lady, call 'em out the lady
Bitches in the back, sniffin crack, sippin Baileys
Strippers on the pole yellin pay me! (yellin pay me!)
Would be surprised how I stack and make that slut go CRAZY!

[Chorus: Ray J]
Yeah I know you heard of us, the murderous, most shady
D-Block, Ray J you better watch your lady
We pop bottles in the club on the daily
And I buss a nigga head if he ever try to play me
Yeah I know you heard of us, the murderous, most shady
D-Block, Ray J you better watch your lady
We pop bottles in the club on the daily
And I buss a nigga head if he ever try to play me</pre>
