[Juvenile]
Look I'm tryin to live right now
Make a better place for my kids right now
Or get out my face is how it is right now
All I wanna have is my own shit right now..
So much go through my head all day
The game situation is be paid or played
I gotta eat the lottery is not for me it's homicide and robbery
And a twenty room mansion, buck-naked with a lot of freaks
It ain't cool if my people don't eat they part of the reason
I got away from all that bullshit, that thuggin and thievin
And as far as this Cash Money shit it's part of my blood
And we feed each other everyday by showin 'em love
It don't matter what we came into we gonna stay blood
And whoever sleepin on it dem dat's gonna wake up
I need dough to feed me and my people
To get a pie and eat special from, Julio's
Fuck ya boy, I don't care, who he know
Just make sho', that he pay, who he owe
I ain't tryin to be a bully I just want what I earned
He's a hardheaded child and it's time to be learned

[Chorus 2X: Juvenile]
You don't like me, yeah? Well fuck you in ya ass
Niggaz is pure pussy and they made me mad
You don't like me, yeah? Well fuck you in ya ass
Niggaz is pure pussy and they made me mad

[Juvenile]
I've seen shit that a child my age, shouldn'ta saw
They bustin right over the backseat of a stolen car
I was seven they had to be about nine or ten
His momma Fay she done ran through who's dyin again
Damn but I don't really think she mean what she say
As soon as she smoke that crack, shit done fucked with her head
Momma gon' love her kids, any place, anywhere
And if momma don't love her children, then momma need prayer
Durin the struggles of my life I learned to take heed to shit
I paid attention to everything that went on in the bricks
All of the early morning rushes to the late night fights
I always visioned that one day this would be my life
Back then it wasn't gravy, the street wasn't right
Especially in our house, we didn't eat some nights
On come new technology these days and times
And it gave us other avenues and ways to grind
Fuck what you got nigga, I'm makin mine
I messed up my first lil change, I'ma be straight this time
To the fullest, always huntin, for it to spend
I went out and got it dawg, I can do it again

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
Get off the block lil nigga this my spot lil nigga
I don't care what you got you get shot lil nigga
I been thuggin, and I'm lovin my life
The reason I made it to here because I been livin trife
For spite stoppin knockin old niggaz off
Tryin to be the fuckin boss and shotcall
Ride round in the toughest cars, double R's
Fuckin over niggaz don't want see me ball
Now which one of your peers wanna come do this
I ain't with all of that talkin cause my gun do flip
Lift niggaz off they feet when they run they lip
Tryin to tell you bout people, tell you that chick's on chips
You don't like me, yeah? Well fuck you in ya ass
Niggaz is pure pussy and they made me mad
I'm straight off of the street that's why I'm out chea bad
Comin through yo' door with a bag and a Mag

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
If you don't like me nigga, nigga come out
Fuck, I don't like you either though bitch-ass nigga
Boy-ass nigga.. what? Fuck you in ya ass

[Chorus]

Da da da
