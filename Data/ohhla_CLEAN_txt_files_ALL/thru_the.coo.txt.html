[Coolio]
I take a look thru the window and all I see is pain
burnin on my brain like some weird type of acid rain
or a virus, it's something that I can't explain
I use to be different but now it seems that I'm the same
as the rest of these hard heads in my hood
I'm livin foul even though momma raised me good
Everywhere I turn it and everywhere I look 
everybody that I know is, livin like a crook, and the
The cops wanna throw the book
the kitchen sink, a upper cut and a left hook
How can I explain this battering that we caught, it
wasn't the way I was raised, it was the way I was taught
And the streets is a motherfucker (motherfucker)
But I be growin up like another sucker ('nother sucker)
I say the bomb be the last as I reflect on the past
with my face, pressed against the glass

[Billy Boy]
In nightfall thru the window, a silhouette
Beads of sweat and the palm of my hand is still wet
So put the safety on the Tek because this ??? ??? started yet
So many yesterdays I can't forget
And now it's nighttime but it seem like daytime
Helicopter lights makin the bud light like sunshine on my mind
Crack addicts, kids with automatics
Thugs who want static and those who already had it
Manifestations of a spirit, trapped in a flesh cage
Mind in fifth gear, imagination rampage
My brothers is walking thru night like a thief in the night
Three strikes you're out because the color's not right
And all I axe is "Why we jack and fight?" and try to save enough right
and I'm wrapped too tiiiight, uhh
Blowin in the pistol, suckin on some indo, lookin thru the window
and that's all I see, uhh

[Coolio]
I'm hittin corners on the boulevard, lookin hard
Rims are shinin, sound is bumpin, I'm a superstar, yeah
Rollin in the ride and it's not mine but
that's alright cos I still feel fine

[Billy Boy]
Now I'm strapped with nothin but my mind and a screwdriver
Gimme twenty seconds at your skills like MacGyver (who?)
And I can take anything that I wanna take
but when you slip and push your fate, I'm parlayin off your paper like when
I'm

[Coolio]
Yankee Doodle came to Jersey rollin on some Dayton's (Dayton's)
Kept an Uzi under his seat so fools wouldn't take him (take him)

[Billy Boy]
My homey had a cadillac sweeter than all the others
Went into the wrong hood, so they choked the motherfucker

[Coolio]
That's how it goes (yeah) and that's how it feels (right)
New Jersey Drive is for real
That's how it goes and that's how it feels
New Jersey Drive is for real (ugh)
