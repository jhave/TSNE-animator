[Intro - Lloyd Banks]
Yeah!
Aye yo 50
They don't do it like us nigga
Yeah!

[Chorus]
I'm so fly, I got money
So that's good enough reason to buy the things I buy
I'm so high, I'm on point
And I could tell that your jealous just by the look in your eye
And when I ride by
I don't care, G-Unit's going straight to the top this year
Nigga I'm so fly, I got money
So that's good enough reason to buy the things I buy

[Verse - Lloyd Banks]
Uh, Banks is fresh out the gutter
Too smooth to stutter
The cig a melt a brother like two scoops of butter
Before I leave the crib I tell my mother I love her
Grab the burner
But she ain't concerned 'cause he's a earner
My bitch lays it out real nice for me to murder
We fight, wake up and fuck like Ike and Tina Turner
Its a privilege to ride with a celeb'
'Cause them girls over here don't got a problem giving head
Paranoia is on ya', that's why ya' llama's in ya' bed
Fuck some real Chinchilla, buy some Llama for ya' head
Where the block I'm from
Niggaz be damn near forty and still tucking
And niggaz baby mama's is pregnant and still fucking
It's either 'cause they boyfriends a scrub like Brillo
'Cause Banks is cooler than the other side of the pillow
The chronic is blown
For my niggaz that got locked up and deported
And now they gotta go back home

[Chorus]

[Verse - Lloyd Banks]
Don't confuse me with the suckers
'Cause when I spit, You'll hear more Oh's
Then a Skip-to my-Lou move at the Rucker
Thank God for giving Banks the gift
You think that bandana makes you look gangsta
But all I see is a handkerchief
Nigga there's no one out the click that freezes
Believe that, 'cause I ain't scared a shit but Jesus
Look dog, I don't run with the poodles
Difference is, I'm eating in Rome and you eating Roman Noodles
Ya' boy is corrupt kid
Banks a send a bitch to the store
Just for a piece of cheesecake like Puff did
You chumps cant afford these homes
Look around I got forty clones
Now look down, that's forty stones
And that's only in the necklace
I'm bony and I'm wreck lace
It's Tony in a Lexus
I'm fresh out the gutter, scrap what ya' man thought
I'm in the hood with more straps than a Jan sport

[Chorus]

[Verse - Lloyd Banks]
When I travel I know I'm gon' get stuck
'Cause they harass us in the airport
Like I'm the one that's blowing shit up
I got the patience of a High School teacher
And a bright future
Why the fuck would I have a bum on my sneaker?
All the goodie girls back off us
My hearts colder then Jack Frost's
We pack shows and attract bosses
Black clothes with my black Forces
A black rose for a rats coffin
I'm blowing O's of that black coughing
Blow on the road then I'm back flossing
No one knows how much that's costing
Fuck ass, only the green moves me
I got a clean Uzi
A pair of gloves and a mask from the Scream movie
So if you plotting on popping off, then scheme smoothly
Or get a little red splatter on ya' cream Coogi
My name ring each state
So you ain't gotta go all the way to L.A. to get ya MC ate

[Chorus]</pre>
