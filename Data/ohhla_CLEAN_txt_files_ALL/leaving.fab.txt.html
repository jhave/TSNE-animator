Song:   Leaving You
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Leave you, I never mean to [4x]

[Verse 1]
I guess making sure that you good was my bad
I kinda thought you had the same feelings I had
And you helped sell it like a fly ad
But you was mackin at the house, Ipad
Not mad, but there's a few disappointments
Let's just say that I canceled all the few appointments
I blew paper with you, not a joint bitch
I say bitch when I'm tryna make a point bitch
Other times I call it how I see it
I won't give you the title if you don't know how to be it
Which proves, I love it when the shits smooth
But show yo ass to yo nikka that's a bitch move
I'ma ride but what are you about yo
You gon pull a Trey and say let me out though
Never saw it coming, what a cheap shot
Your strongest enemies the one who know ya weak spot

[Chorus]
Leave you, I never mean to [4x]

[Verse 2]
I kinda wonder if I cross ya mind
Maybe you my ex cause you crossed the line
Maybe you just never saw the crossing signs
Cause the hand up means don't walk
We don't talk
And somewhere there's a disconnection
You take it the wrong way so much misdirection
Baby what it is, tell me what it does
This is what it is, fuck what it was
But it was good while it lasted
But when its dead let it go, put it in a casket
And don't dig it back up
Got my swagga back up
I pick up to call you then I hang it back up
Yeah, and Imma get back to em
To know a backstabber, you gotta turn ya back to em
Well maybe its just me and I'm going crazy
But let me ask you this
Where you going baby?

[Chorus]
Leave you, I never mean to [6x]</pre>
