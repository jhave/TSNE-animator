Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Niggas sent into the army but they still weren't preparing
Shotgun, I hurt more than these goddamn feelings
Half a ticket on his head so you know his ass missin
I bend another half a ticket, he gon make it past Christmas
Hood drinkin all day, I've been so goddamn busy
And the juice got me dizzy 10 times past tipsy
Time I don't have to tell a nigga to ride with me
And running up on Gucci Mane is real real risky
I still send the squares out of town, long distance
The crockers that I serve, favor rap a little disky
Half a pint, I'm a put it in a goddamn misky
And I'm a have money just as long as they print it

[Chorus]
Somebody tryna take all my drugs
Somebody tryna fuck with my plug
Most rappers can't come to my hood
Sucka niggas can't smoke on this bud
Nobody ever talked so about drugs
How the hell you get that in this club?
I got 100 thousand, kush in my tuck
The only thing I wanna do is re up

[Verse 2]
I got a lotta hustle, I remix bands
3 band game, we got bitch for sale
Count up, count up, count up, count up checks
I could still cook it with the dope with
20% bricks, I could work with that
Dumb as hell, with the brick squad stamp
Man Gucci flexin, countin 3 racks
We always finessin, they don't like that
Try to take my plug, get yo ass whacked
Scooter real street nigga â that's a fact
Take yo ass off and I don't give a damn
I do anything for them free bands

[Chorus]
Somebody tryna take all my drugs
Somebody tryna fuck with my plug
Most rappers can't come to my hood
Sucka niggas can't smoke on this bud
Nobody ever talked so about drugs
How the hell you get that in this club?
I got 100 thousand, kush in my tuck
The only thing I wanna do is re up

[Verse 3]
I remix this Sprite with 6 ounces of codeine
The say I drink this shit like it give me protein
Going hard with my plug, you tell me don't stop
I'm tryna clean this money up, I need some Clorox
I re up Monday, Thursday I'm back at it
Count this money, dog these bitches they my bad habits
Put your car beside my car and let's see which the fastest
And watch me disappear, bitch I'm blue magic
Fuck what a bitch say, I can't hear shit but static
I rubber band it up and had it in the attic
Young and flashy, yo bitch young and nasty
In the re up I feel like Biggie, I'm going back to Cali

[Chorus]
Somebody tryna take all my drugs
Somebody tryna fuck with my plug
Most rappers can't come to my hood
Sucka niggas can't smoke on this bud
Nobody ever talked so about drugs
How the hell you get that in this club?
I got 100 thousand, kush in my tuck
The only thing I wanna do is re up</pre>
