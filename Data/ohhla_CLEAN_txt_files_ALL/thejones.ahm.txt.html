Don't let the Jones' get you down

(Get you down)
(Don't let the Jone's get you down)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Thinkin well it's the niggaroe back with my crew
Now what you wanna do
The Jones', we on this, mic
So we'll fight to the finish
But I don't need spinach for me to do this
Pride in givin niggas pop-eyes, I'm large as buddhist
Rappers wanna be down, cause they think that I'm better than
They, but I'll be OK-Solo like the Letterman
Use my common sense to boom-shalaklak-boom
Then lock the room, get busy as I get busy
Sayin "Don't let the Jones' get you..."
But I'll hit you where it hurts, made you relapse in curves
When I throw verbs and nouns, any sound that I spit up
I have battle rappers usin they clappers because they don't wanna get up
They all wanna be like me, and so they re-write
Them wack-ass raps that they make and try to fake
So I break bones and holler "Jones' forever"
Cleverest shit around
But don't ever let us get you down

[ VERSE 2 ]
Well, everybody says, "'Mad, what are the Jones'?"
Well, let's see, it's a posse, true, and it's a crew
But not really, so what I'm gonna do
Is combine em all and find a title that'll fit
We're a group of money makers from the west that be runnin shit
Fly like a discus, don't miss this, cause it's me, and
I win fights with more mic energy than a pre-amp
They listen to Ahmad and the Jones' in here rock 
And roll with soul, then wanna copy like a Xerox
Cause I mic-check and never once sound like Das at all
&gt;From a superman crew, so I do the impossible
Droppin y'all wack crews like missiles, then I whistle
Kendal'll bring the 808 until the party say, "the great
'Mad is the king of the ring," because I bring
Funk that shakes the ground
But don't ever let us get you down

(And everybody wanna be like us
I think it's cause we on this mic
We're the Jones', so)
Don't let the Jones' get you down

[ VERSE 3 ]
Kick it, I'm back, never can lose, I'm the man when I wanna
Might gruff on rappers get ran like Jackie Joyner
The Jones' everybody wanna be us, they be jockin
Cause we rockin the boat and in control like a remote
So I pack a 38-page rap book, put your gun away
And yell 'truce!' before I have to get loose and run away
With the title I've already won, don't mean to brag
Kendal blew up like a rocket, and I get down like a sag
I nag rappers that don't follow my lead, and if they need
Assistance they get dragged the distance in a bag
The Jones' for life, throw up a J if they ever say
Who's runnin this town
But don't ever let us get you down

Don't let the Jones' get you down
