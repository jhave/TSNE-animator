Uh, uh, uh, whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah
I know it's not too ghetto
I know it's not too ghetto
I said I know it's not too ghetto
Whoa

You better check yourself, respect yourself
You better go for self because I flow for self
You gets no love from me

I'll tell you why there's no love
Simply you're not cool enough
For what we had between us
Don't you know you lost my touch
People ask me where you've been
And I tell them where just friends
Cos it's so obvious that it's never gonna work for us
Oh no, no

Play with my emotions, you gets no devotions
And you gets no love, gets no love
You can't get no love from me
You can't even be my friend
And you gets no love again
Whatever you do it will come back to you

Tell you why we can't hook up
Cos I had about enough
Hearing all the lies you tell
Boy I though I knew you well
People think that you're my man (my man)
They don't even understand (because)
Just because I let you get some
That don't make it ??
We ain't even in love
You know that you play

Play with my emotions, you gets no devotions
And you gets no love, gets no love
You can't get no love from me
You can't even be my friend (yeah)
And you gets no love again (come on)
Whatever you do it will come back to you (ay yo faith)

	[P. Diddy]
Let me talk to em one time, check this out
Yo how the situation get so raw
To the point we don't kiss no more
Things I miss you don't miss no more
That night I met you on the disco floor
Every night since missed you more
Making hits on tour
Now when I knock you don't answer the door
The phone ring you don't answer no more
Cos you ain't tryna chance it no more
Got to find me a new diva
Something pretty for P. Diddy and his two-seater

	[Loon]
Now you could never have a piece of my love
So when you see me don't reach for no hug
And don't speak in the club
Don't tell me how you deeply in love
Other day you tried to greet me with thugs
That wanted to heat me with slugs
See the message on my beeper was bugged
Try to chill lay deep in the cut
But you keepin it up
Even my girl think of beating you up
The way you keeping in touch
She don't know if niggaz cheating or what

Boy we had a cool relationship (let's go, come on)
But you couldn't handle it

Play with my emotions, you gets no devotions
Whatever you do it will come back to you
You can't even be my friend
And you gets no love again
Said you gets no love, gets no love, gets no love from me
Play with my emotions, you gets no devotions
Whatever you do it will come back to you
You can't even be my friend
And you gets no love again
You gets no love from me
Play with my emotions...</pre>
