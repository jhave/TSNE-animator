[Daz Dillinger]
I was blowed.. just finished fuckin my bitch, countin my shit
Rollin in some marvelous shit (SKIIIRT!!)
Hooked up with the Bigga Figga, fuck Jigga
Me and my niggaz pushin tapes, same as pushin big weight
Mobbin down I-80 in my Mercedes truck with my buddies
On the site to get nutty, play some niggaz like putty
Ready you that fo', bumrushin and rushin the do'
From the Beach to Fillmoe, niggaz be bout that dough
Cash dollars make me holla, pop my collar and don't bother
Niggaz and baby mama drama givin me drama
But I -- some how some way
Keep comin up with gangsta-ass shit like every single day
Get out my way fore yo' bitch-ass get sprayed down
Cuz Tha Gamblaz, we came here to shut shit down
Come around town with fo' pounds sittin in my lap
Gimme my nigga Figga daps then we all about snaps
I adapt to whatever - the longer I live
nigga the more I get clever
Ran through the storms I bring harm
Roll ya over, ring the alarm
Nigga get ready we bout to drop the bomb, but ah..

[Hook: Daz]
Nigga tell me what the fuck you gon' do
Betta stop when ya spot my crew nigga, oooooh
Tell me what the fuck you gon' do
Ya get dropped when ya step to my crew nigga, oooooh
Tell me what the fuck you gon' do
Betta stop when ya spot my crew nigga, oooooh
Nigga tell me what the fuck you gon' do
Ya get dropped when ya spot my crew nigga, oooooh

[Telly Mac]
I put my money where my mouth is, keepin the 'fetti folded
While we rollin in winnings, heavy-hitters, nothin but gritters
Soulja rags and spitters - four niners chasin the cheddar
Mini-macks and berettas, big shit, tucked in they leathers
For this type of weather, it's recommeded that ya low-key
Ya know me, the young O.G. that blow trees
while we proceed - I know ya mobbin to this
Pushin compact discs, by the box or by the brick
Now we checkin chips, you know the routine we too clean
Real niggaz do things, straight cash for two blings
Iced out my shoestrings, cash on delivery
Takin wads and bundles in the minute I know ya feelin me
We hustlin, Figga roll and Daz Dilli
While we stackin 'em silly, makin moves to get the pennies
Never knew me really - I got my mind made up
Telly Mac the General, Dogg Pound, don't give a fuck

[Hook: Daz]
Bigga Figga tell me what the fuck they gon' do
Get dropped when it comes to my crew nigga, oooooh
Tell me what the fuck they gon' do
Betta stop when it comes to my crew nigga, oooooh
Tell me what the fuck they gon' do
Get dropped when it comes to my crew nigga, oooooh
Tell me what the fuck they gon' do
Betta stop when it comes to my crew nigga, oooooh

[JT the Bigga Figga]
We on some new and improved shit
Some improve shit for gettin rich
My clique'll benefit from gettin chips
Conduct business and this is how we flip
Fuckin with pimps and mobsters to prosper
over niggaz that's wack and ask for Oscars
My team roster, consist of the Get Low P's
So get yo' G's and nigga keep it movin like the breeze
It's Tha Gamblaz and the DPG's lockin the scene
And we them niggaz in the labs that's rockin that cream
On the point just like the block and the beam
The hard hustlin amounts to G's
Motherfucker, know what I mean?
It was all a dream, then it fucked around and came real
We writin platinum hits to flip scripts and try to gain scrill'
So my nigga just pass me the peel
And watch me show my skills like Shaquille O'Neal
We on the paper route for mil's, bigface dollar bills
Iced out grills, blowin to kill, fuck whatcha feel
Nigga chill for real, you know the deal
In the street it's one shot one kill, motherfucker

[Hook: Daz]
Yeah tell me what the fuck you gon' do
Get dropped when it comes to my crew nigga, oooooh
Tell me what the fuck you gon' do
Betta stop when ya spot my crew nigga, oooooh
Tell me what the fuck they gon' do
Get dropped when it comes to my crew nigga, oooooh
Tell me what the fuck they gon' do
Betta stop when ya spot my crew nigga, oooooh</pre>
