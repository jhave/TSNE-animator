[Chorus: TL Cross] (Jadakiss)
The one thing y'all don't know about me, I don't play, so just beware
You catch me up in V.I.P. up in the club that's my atmosphere
Plus I got, money to spend I keep, gettin it in from the hood so I don't play fair
And I'm a be (What's Up!) Livin it up (What's Up!) Keep, gettin up (What's Up!)
Keep, throwin it up (EH HEHHHHHH!!!!) Until it all falls down

[Verse One: Jadakiss]
Yeah! Yo! Break the peas down to onions, money in abundance
I'm in the lower millions I'm tryin to get in the hundreds
Niggas pants too tight to fight, so they don't want it
Pay for somebody to protect you so where your gun at?
Been there done that, seen the coke come back
Seen niggas come home from jail then run back
Singin the same sad song my nigga won that
Negative energy stick to him like a thumb tack 
Real hustler probably sold a milion and one packs
Niggas think they smart and nice but they dumb wack
It's only 'til you crack they skull give 'em a mumwrap
When it's cold I reside wherever the sun's at
Son's back...what!!!!!

[Chorus: Cross] (Jadakiss)
The one thing y'all don't know about me
I don't play, so just beware (UH UH!!! What's up!)
You catch me up in V.I.P.
up in the club that's my atmosphere (Uh huh! What's Up!)
Plus I got, money to spend I keep
gettin it in from the hood so I don't play fair (EH HEHHHHHHHH!!!)
And I'm a be (What's Up!) Livin it up (EH HEHHHH!) Keep, gettin up (What's Up!)
Keep, throwin it up (UH! YEAH! UH!!!!) Until it all falls down

[Verse Two: Jadakiss]
Yo! Top of the league, three piece suits or fatuges
All I gotta do is look a certain way and you'll bleed
Four words describe me, niggas can't fuck around
Fishscale verses, prices go up and down
Put it out there, see if it taste right
Young Jewish bulldog keepin the case right
Apartment on the fourth floor keepin the base right
Jacksons and Benjamins keepin the safe right
First and the fifteenth is when we break nights
Bunch of red beams on your head like break lights
Bitches that fucked everybody turned into fake dykes
Plus bitin a whole day it's 'gon be a great night
LET'S GO!!!!

[Chorus: TL Cross] (Jadakiss)
The one thing y'all don't know about me
I don't play, so just beware (UH UH!!! What's up!)
You catch me up in V.I.P.
up in the club that's my atmosphere (Uh huh! What's Up!)
Plus I got, money to spend I keep
gettin it in from the hood so I don't play fair (Uh huh! What's Up!))
And I'm a be (What's Up!) Livin it up, keep, gettin up (EH HEHHHHHHHH!!!)
Keep, throwin it up (UH!) Until it all falls down

[Verse Three: Jadakiss]
Yeah! Yo! Dice hittin the wall, decks gettin shuffled
Nines gettin wiped down tek's gettin muffled
Calico's in the plastic stacks in the duffle
Niggas comin through gettin racks off the muscle
Yo asked me for money I ain't asked you to hustle
The industry is hurt they lookin for the next Russell
The hip hop cops outside waitin to cuff you
The Bloods is on Rikers Island waitin to touch you
Niggas on the outside just wantin to abduct you
Dudes turned their back on you that you looked up to
Keep throwin mine in the air, I got enough to
I don't like spendin my money nigga I love to
Love to.......WHAT!!!!!

[Chorus: TL Cross] (Jadakiss)
The one thing y'all don't know about me
I don't play, so just beware (UH UH!!! What's up!)
You catch me up in V.I.P.
up in the club that's my atmosphere (Uh huh! What's Up!)
Plus I got, money to spend I keep
gettin it in from the hood so I don't play fair (Uh huh! What's Up!))
And I'm a be (What's Up!) Livin it up, keep, gettin up
Keep, throwin it up, Until it all falls down</pre>
