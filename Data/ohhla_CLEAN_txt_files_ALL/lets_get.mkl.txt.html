[Intro: Startel]
Let's go... yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah...

[Startel]
Kaboom, I came through the door
Never seen a girl like you before
Your eyes, your lips, your hair, your smile
Oooh baby, I like your style
Heh, I just need a clue, to what a brother like me must do
The touch, the kiss, to hold, me with
Just get that thing started
Oh no doubt, I'm gon' love you right (no, no, no, no, no)
Woman so just cozy now, there when you need me to hold you tight
Never left stressed out, or in doubt (oh, no, no, no, no)
Well welcome to the world of the Real McCoy
Three times a man, never was a boy

[Chorus: Startel]
Baby, we're here doing nothing
We should be into something
I'm looking at you, you're looking at me
It's all good, girl, burn some weed
No need, you stand around fronting
Let's go get into something
I'm crushing on you, you're crushing on me
Let's go kick and roll some trees

[Startel]
It's so cool, I moved close to you
I begin to smell your sweet perfume
I smiled, said hi, y'all don't, reply
I like it when they act too fly
Heh, all insecurities, could never discourage me
The smooth, finesse, I will, impress
Can't help, but to, confess
I came here just to love you right (no, no, no, no, no)
Woman so just cozy now, there when you need me to hold you tight
Never left stressed out, or in doubt (oh, no, no, no, no)
Well welcome to the world of the Real McCoy
Three times a man, never was a boy

[Chorus]

[Masta Killa]
Aiyo, peace beautiful, here's just a few lines
To let you know I was thinking, look I had a few drinks and
Then I lit a bone, thinking bout your skin tone
Pretty fat face, with your high cheek bone
I love to hear you moan, you know our phone conversation is grown
You sayin' "daddy come home", I'm all alone
Here staring at your picture, kinda hating, I miss ya
I soon come kiss ya pain and make it better
You dressed with my sweater, for the scent of your man
While I'm out hustlin', black gloves on my hand
My mind pan, pictures you in front of the fan
I know it's been a little while since you felt my embrace
You miss daddy taste, you pace back and forth
In your Vicky thong lace, the anticipation is great
You can't erase, the thought of my arrival
Feel the tingle, it's the sensation

[Hook: Startel]
I be rubbing that, holding that, loving that
Girl, I know you like it like that
I'm looking at you, you're looking at me
It's all good, girl, burn some weed
I be loving that, holding that, squeezing that
Girl, what you gon' do?
I'm looking at you, you're looking at me
It's all good, girl, burn some weed

[Chorus]</pre>
