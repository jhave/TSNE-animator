[Chorus]
I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time
so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world

[Verse 1]
I got my cup filled, bitches all around me on some bachelor shit
Eyes half closed, heavy like they was attached to bricks
Around the world I use my atlas make a map of it
Globe trotter, hoe hopper, super star, ask direct [?]
People always wonder so they ask us who we are
Pullin' up to clubs when we too young to hit the bar
Wanna be on top and tryna get there by tomar (tomorrow)
See, money, bitches love me, designer clothes foregin cars
But, I, ain't never gonna change different city everyday you hear these people scream my name
They think I'm underage, they don't know shit about the game
Till I'm drunk as fuck, on the couch, pouring out champagne
Living life like it's my job, and I don't ever take a day off
Shit ain't been the same since I seen my music take off
I be on some "I don't give a fuck" shit
Still with my homies I came up with, so celebrate the fast track [?]

[Chorus]
I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time
so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world

[Verse 2]
Hey, go Europe to Japan, then Mexico to France
Bithces of every nationality get up and dance
So, let me see your hands please
We makin' noise like a stampede
So much smoke up in this bitch you can't breathe
Somewhere where it's sandy, Cali or Miami
This the only way to do never made a plan B
Can't we, get it how we live
Tonight is the night to chill, tonight we do it big
Girls, comin' all dressed up and they takin' off their clothes
We know your man an ameteur so come party with some pros
You need something new, I know your life is gettin' old
We ain't gettin' younger so tonights the night to go
So, crazy, treat it like your last night
Even if you broke, spend tonight like you cash right
It's the fast life, don't worry baby we ain't here to slow it down
Tonight we goin' crazy and tomorra' you can hold me down

[Chorus]
I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time
so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world</pre>
