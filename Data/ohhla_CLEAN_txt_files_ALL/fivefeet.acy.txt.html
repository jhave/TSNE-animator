Talkin' shit while he was rollin' his weed
My nigga hit him in the face
(broken blunts, broken fronts)
He didn't know that disrespect would lead to such a serious case
(broken law, broken jaw)
If you knew how to read the situation you would stay in your place
(broken arm socket, broken pocket)
If there's one thing that everyone needs, it's they goddamn space
Let me talk about it as I rock it

Give me five feet
All around the world
I don't want nobody touchin' me unless it's my girls
I give a pound, a hug, some love, but that's that
Don't be tappppin' me on the shoulders
Or pattin' me on the back
Or pull on my arm
Checkin' my size
I'm liable to do you harm
My temple is my prize
I'm wise and on the real-ly
I ain't too touch feel-ly
If you put your hands upon me I might just smack you silly
It's a billion people--touch somebody else, touch yo'self
I'll be sure to get at you if I'm needin' your help
But until then, maybe when I'm dead and stiff
But to touch you wit'out touchin' you is one of my gifts

Talkin' shit while she was drunk at the bar
My homey slapped her in the face
(dirty mouth, dirty dress)
She didn't know that disrespect would lead to such a serious case
(broken heel, broken nail)
If she knew how to read the situation she would stay in her place
(broken chain, broken locket)
If there's one thing that everyone needs, it's they goddamn space
Let me talk about it as I rock it

Why you all up up up under me, screamin' in my ear?
Why you tryin' to talk over the music when you know we barely can hear?
Why you tuggin' on my coattail, grabbin' on my sleeve?
Yo, cover your mouth when you cough 'round me
Don't touch me when you sneeze
I don't like disesase
And I don't wanna give you what I got
Yeah I'll hit the weed but what I don't need
Is somebody always in my spot
Standin' where I'm standin'
Breathin' down my neck
Yo, have some respect
I guess you think that water ain't wet
Just back the fuck up
No, I ain't stuck up
I just don't wanna hear your moans and groans and hiccups and stuff
And report it with the tape recorders all in my grille
But to touch you wit'out touchin' you is one of my skills

Talkin' shit while he was up on the mic
Somebody hit him in the face
(broken nose, broken flows)
He didn't know that disrespect would lead to such a serious case
(dirty rap, dirty scrap)
If he knew how to read the situation he would stay in his place
(broken eye socket tryin' to block it)
If there's one thing that everyone needs, it's they goddamn space
Let me talk about it as I rock it

Now I'm 'a draw the lines in the ground and show you my square
It's at least arm's distance, so stand over there
Hey love, you know I miss you, and how we embrace
But I'll let you know if I wanna kiss you or see how you taste
Yo, we all got issues we need to face
So don't think I'm tryin' to dis' you when I tell you the case
In case you're wonderin', it's just like that
I'm like there's telepathy
I already know what you're gonna say before you step to me
I hate croweded elevators in downtown rush
Packed trains
Craszy-ass people on the bus
Somtimes I roll plush
Lookin' so Cold Crush
But I'd rather teleport through space so y'all can bite my dust
Use body language baby
I can dig that
But homey you need to kick back and relax on the Ac'
The bottom line is don't invade nobody's zone
Or maybe owe
Sincerely, Aceyalone

Talkin' shit while he was walkin' the street
Somebody shot him in the face
(hurt brother, hurt mother)
He didn't know that disrespect would lead to such a serious case
(makin' waves, makin' days)
If you knew how to read the situation you would stay in your place
('cause you don't understand it don't knock it)
If there's one thing that everyone needs, it's they goddamn space
Let me talk about it as I rock it

Give me five feet all around the world
Give me a zone
My space, my square
And to each his own
To each man and woman and child</pre>
