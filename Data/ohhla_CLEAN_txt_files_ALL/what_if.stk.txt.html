[Eminem]
Yo I got an idea
Let me go grab Sticky right quick

{*sounds of steps*}
Hey yo Stick, Stick

[Sticky]
Yo Slim Shady
Yo I just had like a nightmah..
Wait it wasn't like a nightmare
It was like a good dreah..
Well it wasn't a good.. (What was it?)
Hey yo I just had a crazy dream man (What?)
Yo, yo I dreamt I was white! (Ohhh)

[Chorus: Eminem]
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if he was white?
What if he was
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?

[Verse One: Sticky Fingaz]
Yo, yo
What if I was white skin the same color as cocaine?
Blond hair, blue eyes, the whole shibang
I know one thing; police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me 
(Can I get your autograph?)
The yellow cabs in the city would stop for me
I wouldn't need collateral to buy property
If I was white, wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
SECURITY wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something (Maybe he might of stole something)
Because I'm black I rob and automatically assume I ain't got no job
On my own land I feel like an immigrant
If I was white I wouldn't of thought O.J. was innocent (He did it)

Chorus: Eminem

If I was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (Yo think about that)
What if he was white, white,  white, white, he was white (for a minute)
What if he was white?
What if he was (What if he was white?)
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? 
(What if he was white?)

What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if you were white? (what if he was white?)
What if he was
white, white, white, white, white (STICKyyyy what if you were white?) 
white, white, white, white, white?

[Verse Two: Sticky Fingaz]
If I was white
It would be a different world for me
If I was white (ummmmmmmm?) What shade would I be? 
Would I be Redneck or Skinhead, preppy or high class?
YOU PROBABLY LIVE IN A TRAILERPARK AND BE WHITE TRASH!
In any case that be the ill shit right? (Yep)
But there's a good and bad side of being white
You can't say the N word without startin a fight (What's up my nigger?)
Couldn't dance to a beat, I'd have two left feet
Even if I was white plaque still have a ghetto shit (How you doing?)
Is it a myth or do I really have a little dick (Nah, it's true!)
If I was white, I would probably listen to hard rock
and cover my ears when ever I heard Hip Hop (Ahhhhhhhhhhhh)

[Chorus: Eminem]
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (What if he was white?)
What if he was white, white,  white, white, he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? 
(What if he was white?)

What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (ummmmmmmm?)
What if he was white? (What if you were white?)
What if he was
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? 
(What if he was white?)

[Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz]
Yo, yo, yo, if I was white
I probably wouldn't even think the same
I'd watch Tennis and Golf and bet on Hockey games (Red Wings Man)
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white
I couldn't live around my way
And there probably would of never even been an Onyx, shit
I be serice sippin vodka and tonix
Smokin on a marlboro instead of a Newport
Id live in Long Island instead of New York
If I was white, I probably couldn't dunk
cuz everybody knows white man can't jump (Nope!)
And probably wouldn't be able to go to the weed spot
Cuz all of the dreads would think I'm a cop

[Chorus: Eminem]
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White? (Yo you can't say that)
What if he was white
What if he was
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?

What if you were white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if he was white?
What if he was
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
If he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
(What would you do if you were white?)
What - If - He - Was - White?
(What if you were white?)
white, white, white, white, white, white,
(What if you were white!!!!)
white, white, white, white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
white, white, white, white, white?
What if he was white
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?

[Eminem]
