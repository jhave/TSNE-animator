[J-Bo]
And not once but twice am I back on line
Remarkably delivering these words of mine
And when I come forth I come with such a force
You believe that it's been nice since the last time you felt the need
And that's to get loose and let you soul be free
Cause when we step out in this vision you gon' surely see
And ain't no way in hell we gon' let that ride
While you huggin' on the wall bein' cool denied
Now it done jumped off in the blind of an eye
And everybody's off the hook feelin' good and high
Cause it's the last call for alcohol so just jook and drink
and have a ball cause' we gon' party long until the wee hours
And will it ever end I truly don't doubt it
Youngbloodz is the truth you seen now go shout it
And come back tomorrow and watch the world crowd it

[Chorus]
My drankin' patna, my ace, my dawg, know who I'm gon' call
My drankin' patna, my ace boon coon, when it's time to cut the fool
My drankin' patna, my buddy, by cuzz, loud when he get 'em a buzz
My drankin' patna, my nigga, my folk, gotta drink and he got to smoke, my drankin patna

[Sean Paul]
You know I'm a come in a blunt of 'dro and a corner of hen'
My drankin patna get to it 'fore the day begin
Spillin' hen' all up in the Benz
I'm try'na get to my patna so he can sip some wit' me
We get drunk, bein' tipsy for sissies
Just might get locked up
Cause I can't stop the swervin' have these rims keep hittin' the curves
And just me and my roll dawg always go half
when he got it man he won't crash
my mo'fuckin' patna
hit the trap, cut it, roll it, and smoke it and still got some to put in the glass
my nigga just ought a
fill up my cup see I'm a drunk and man I can't get enough
and when I'm wit' my patna
aint worried bout who drunk the liquor 'cause I know it won't nothin' but us

[Chorus]

[J-Bo]
See that's my dawg, that's my folk, that's my buddy
The nigga that I call to smoke
Drankin' good, him and I, on the go
Cup for cup, blow for blow, high or low
In da wind, crashin' in, settin' it off, pass the hen'
Out the in, crunk as eva, and still at it again
Chic'd up, on the flo' its just me and my drankin patna

[Sean Paul]
I'm only hittin' the club wit' a drank of low, getting' drunk off a dub
Fuck around get knocked up when your folk wanna slow up
You fuck around and get popped in yo' fuckin' wit' my patna
We don't play those games and kind of slizzard, but we neva been lame
I'm at the bar with my patna spendin' all my change
try'na get it all once again with my

[Chorus 3x]</pre>
