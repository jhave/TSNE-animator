I increase my throttle, uplift my shuttle
Tribe in a huddle, pilot on auto - bro
I'm not a role model, more like a psycho
A Bates type of +Psycho+, cut you like Michael
+Halloween+ character, or computer wizard
Hit you with the blizzard, cut your circuit with my scissors
Shorts'll get crossed while you're in the crossfire
You get blasted, you dumb-ass bastard
See you need the day-ta *, better I say dah-ta *		* (data)
You're lookin at the Tribe, and you're a hater
Comin from inside, means I come better
or should I say rather, together I'm gonna set ya
head in the casket, your body in a basket
A tisket, a tasket -- I told ya I'm gonna blast ya
When I'm on the psycobeta, state of
mind over magnum, you know I'm gonna tag them
You're gonna get flunked when I buck ya down
You know you're gonna get flunked when I buck ya down
You know you're gonna get flunked when I buck ya down
What you're runnin from, is the psycobetabuckdown!

[B]	Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
[S]	Psycobetaduckdown baby!
[B]	Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
[S]	It's a psycobetaduckdown!  Huh!
[B]	Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
[S]	It's a psycobetaduckdown!
[B]	Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
[S]	Somebody's gettin bucked down

[B-Real]
See I'm from South Central, bustin out my metal
rapid-fire petal, funk is makin me get mental
Yo, it make no sense, so here son ?
Sen start the massacre, as I get nasal
The phase'll be like a murderer's maze yo
You won't find B-Real, inside any kind of cage yo
Sen is the gangsta, me I'm just a pimp
Broads swingin off my dick like a chimp, simpin
So what's the story - you come lookin for me?
Better just scatter, or you're gettin leaded
I'm the one who said it, boy it doesn't matter
You're gonna get splattered, with my funky ill juice
Cause I'm +The Phuncky Feel One+, makin you get real loose
My intellect, dialect, dialogue, intellect, catalogue
from what you want me to select
different forms of beta, psycho for alpha
The way I stay in control of myself
I'm not one of many penny ante on the gauges
in the stone ages, make minimum wages
Show me where the stage is, I come to get the brain on
HEY MAN, get the fuck off the 'caine bruh!
You're gonna get flunked when I buck ya down
You know you're gonna get flunked when I buck ya down
You know you're gonna get flunked when I buck ya down
What you're runnin from, is the psycobetabuckdown!

[B]	Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
