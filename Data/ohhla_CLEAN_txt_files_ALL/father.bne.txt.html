We all so scared cause its, its war everywhere, you know
War everywhere

(Chorus)
How many friends will we see die? (Why we so scared cause it's war everywhere)
How many friends will we see cry? (It's war everywhere)
How many friends will we see try? (Why we so scared cause it's war everywhere)
How many friends will we see die? (It's war everywhere)

All we need is a little love, and someone standing for the little cubs
And I see brutality all over niggas killin' niggas
The ghetto got them being born to be killas
Flooded with drugs and tryin to get us, so get up
But don't give up, ya'll gotta sit up
If you last before they kill us
And the guerillas, try come kill us
Pillage the village and we'll be winna
I love it when niggas the way we took it to another level
So many rebels doing the best shit forever remembered
And in the killing fields, everybody's locked up
And good niggas getting shot up da dadan dada
Mind if I say something for mine
Cause it's about time, to get serious
A mysterious time, blind melons
It ain't no telling, if the willing
Will stop chillin', then help the children
Turning them out, then burning them out
Like morphine, waters getting shallow
It's over and over the gallow
A president in the drop, it's on now though
The end of life, for now so
I think it's the ozone, bad to the bone bone
Mother Nature be long gone
And don't nobody wanna do nothing but speculate
And all they worried about their own
Wrote a song for the future
Millenium, I'm in, I'm hopeing it don't last untill we all past
Living in the stars, looking through grass
Aboard the enterprise, recognize this, in the course of a da-da-da-da-da-da-day
And thats the way we sing, thats the way we play
that's the way they . . now and

[Chorus 2X]

Still got bombs from the cold war, radioactive
And the critics, they wont take action
They want us to repo this to your satisfaction
But while they build more, computers keep crashing
What about felling, pestilence dammit
How do we manage to keep standing
Living in a legacy of bitterness
With the epitimy of vigorous trips on the ships we were crammed in, slammed in
Other man and them, why don't we demanding our damn money
If we can't get forty acres and a mule, let a nigga get a range rover
Shit you got time you, I'm still waiting on a canoe, but it will never come
I don't even know where I come from or where I'm gonna go to
I'm headed to the mother land, but will I be accepted by the brotha man?
Awww me so confused, with nothing to gain and everything to lose, choose
The righteous and the high, look in the eyes and realize the lies
Family ties, but not even for the have-nots
Who the enemy? It ain't me. It ain't even the police
Unless they trippin', and use that authority and start flippin', flippin'
Leaving dead bodies, and with them bitchin' hotties
That poppin' the collar, my god I'm horny, ride shotty
And tellin' the kids that ain't the way to live properly
Get yo monopoly and get your own property
And that's the way we sing, and that's the way we play
and that's the way they . . . now and

[Chorus 2X]

Ooooh and the daddies and momma forgivin' so we can live with us
And all the runaways get off the bus
Kids, put the guns down, come down
If the rest build a bridge with us, it gotta get better than this
It's head of the risk, shoulda been poor, and I been rich
Lost so many friends to the war shit, caution
When I get to walkin', and it's mobbin', nigga in a crypt
Life is a fight to the street life, tonight
I might go meet the reaper, and I will give him a hug
And tell him "Thug luv won and I'm so glad to meet ya"
And that's the way we sing, and that's the way we play
and that's the way they . . . now and

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
