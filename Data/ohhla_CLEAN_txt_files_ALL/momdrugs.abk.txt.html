Song:   Mommy's Doin' Drugs
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Why these kids always smelling like a blunt
Mommy's doin' drugs, mommy's doin' drugs
Two mismatched socks and hair fucked up, why
Mommy's doin' drugs, mommy's doin' drugs
Never fed, always saying that they hungry
Mommy's doin' drugs, mommy's doin' drugs
Now I guess I know what happened to that money
Mommy's doin' drugs, mommy's doin drugs
This situation I can't take, now I'm angry
Mommy's doin' drugs, mommy's doin' drugs
I can't believe she would do this to the family
Mommy's doin' drugs, mommy's doin' drugs

[Chorus x2]
Dear mom, how you doin (how you doin)
(I'm just writing) I'm just writing to see if you alright

Always mad, taking it out on us
Mommy's doin' drugs, mommy's doin' drugs
Turning into a person no one can trust
Mommy's doin' drugs, mommy's doin' drugs
It ain't our fault that she acts this way, it's just
Mommy's doin' drugs, mommy's doin' drugs
And if she don't get help, then I swear will run away because
Mommy's doin' drugs, mommy's doin' drugs

[Chorus x2]

It's been about six weeks and moms seems straight
Hopefully it's the last time she'll have to rehabilitate
Actually it will be, for us that is cause
I'm a court date away from being granted the kids
All I know that it's time to make a change
Erase all the memories and wipe away the pain
Embrace my kids and give em nothing but love
And try to help them forget that they mom is on drugs

[Chorus x2]

Hey mom what's up, you doing aright, we just came here to see if you alright, you know
They taking care of you up there, don't worry about it, we got everything takin care of at home
You just get your rest, alright</pre>
