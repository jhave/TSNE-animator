Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Bridge]
Don't feel so wrong
I don't wanna waste no time
Beautiful here are you
I'm gonna ask you to keep it true

[Verse 1]
It's a feeling that you can't believe
You know I need you like I need to breathe
It will always be MOB
But I be terry I would never leave
Half fight the battle we both first class
When she thrill me on my travels in her absence
She still live sitting still on me
Wear it like a Chanel 5
Make a nigga brag all them trips to LI
Ain't no frontin I care for her
Tryin to find her some times fuck up my train of thoughts
Recorder sessions got mad clip
Keep a nigga high she a bad bitch

[Chorus]
Baby don't you, baby don't you know you're so beautiful, beautiful
Baby don't you know you're so beautiful
Baby don't you, baby don't you know you're so beautiful, beautiful
Baby don't you, baby don't you know you're so beautiful

[Verse 2]
Lord knows you're so beautiful in vincent
I need you in my life like income
Walking past TSA and they all cough
It's all your fault
Got me so up there I forgot how to spray that John Paul
Come here, 365 day love together all year
Every black I got should have your name on it
'Cause you was there when I wrote it
You was there when I performed it
You was there when I made this beat
It was just you and me
Logic pro and the ex see I'm with 25 kids
My super woman meant for all purposes
She take me away like child protective services

[Chorus]
Baby don't you, baby don't you know you're so beautiful, beautiful
Baby don't you know you're so beautiful
Baby don't you, baby don't you know you're so beautiful, beautiful
Baby don't you, baby don't you know you're so beautiful

[Verse 3]
She like heroine in the purest form
You ain't gotta tell her shit she know she bomb
No one growing up got her on the arm
Moved into the suburbs family owned a farm
Cousins out in Oregon, high blitzer
Still a good joint overall, got me feeling bug
Shit I need her in my life I'm a fiend like my man Jones
Got me feeling good, got a nigga in this damn song

[Verse 4]
Damn I'm so damn gone
My mind so far out of this world it can't run
It's nowhere to go ye I know our love is on fire let it burn though,
Smoking on that deadly, poor bear earn flow
Born in the basement the setup helps your growing
The air made you spread out, the lights made you potent
The bond we have is something similar to floid
Mayweather junior's joy will never be broken simply cut it

[Bridge]
Don't feel so wrong
I don't wanna waste no time
Beautiful here are you
I'm gonna ask you to keep it true

[Chorus]
Baby don't you, baby don't you know you're so beautiful, beautiful
Baby don't you know you're so beautiful
Baby don't you, baby don't you know you're so beautiful, beautiful
Baby don't you, baby don't you know you're so beautiful</pre>
