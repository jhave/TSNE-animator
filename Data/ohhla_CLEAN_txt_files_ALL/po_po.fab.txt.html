[Intro- Fabolous and Cop]
Cop: Alright there ah buddy license and registration
Fab: Uh officer is there a problem man whats going on?
Cop: Yeah, I had a report of a UFO
Fab: whats that?
Cop: An unidentified Ferrari looking object flying by me on the highway
Cop: you know how fast you were going?
Fab: nah not at all man
Cop: you must have been going pretty damn fast because my radar is over there smoking buddy
Cop: keep your hands where I can fucking see 'em too
Cop: I heard about you in the paper, I know you got the toaster strudel (mumbles)
Cop: yeah I need some backup over here I've got two rap singers

[Fabolous]
I wonder briefly
Could it be there's no roof above me
or the 22's underneath me
Thats keepin them sirens flashin on my ass
Should I get to pumpin the brakes or mashin on the gas?
I'm naturally harassed
And I feel like I'm getting punked... but I don't see Ashton in the grass
Nor is there a camera stashed into the dash
It's a guy in a uniform and a passion that he has
For flashin wit his badge
And shining light in my face
Plus he keep his right hand right by his waist
The wrong move will get a gun right in my face
And they fighting for my life... I'm fighting the case
And I ain't trying to be the story they twist in the press
Like: the young man resisted arrest
Then he started reaching for something that looks like a pistol I guess
So I pulled on a nigga I mean I pulled on the trigger...figures

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
I go around the corner what do I see?
Po Po's followin me
Askin for my ID whos car I'm driving
Po Po's botherin me
Got me in a lineup, got my hands in cuffs
They don't wanna set me free
Trying to bring me down, when they come around
Po Po's fuckin with me

[Cain]
Awe shit the jakes are fucking with me again
They hate to see me rich, they'd rather see me stuck in the pen
Everytime they walk or pull up beside me
Flash lights in my face askin for my registration and ID
I don't know the reason for the harassment
And the questions they askin
Or the ice grills they get when I'm passin
Or maybe its my fault
Cause I be out all times at night
Doin shit I know I shouldn't plus I don't be ridin right
Smokin' lye.. no stash box for me to put the skit
Two warrants, no license and I ain't got insurance yet
I keep a hammer close because foes wanna stick me up
But keep my movement swift because Po's wanna frisk me up
Since '94 I've been told on by 50 descriptions
And in 10 years not once did they get a conviction
These pigs shouldn't provoke a rider
I'm so tired, they got one more time to fuck wit me before I open fire

[Nate Dogg]
ones for the money and twos for the show
three must be for the motherfuckin po po'
I've seen ghetto kings fall to the floor
cause they can't see ask (?)
(still some of y'all creepin with the Po Po's
Sleepin wit the Po Po's
Some of y'all walking wit the Po Po's
I ain't fuckin with the Po Po's)

[Fabolous]
BITCH!
They gon' have to put my back on the cement
Before I'm in the back with my knee bent
On my way back to the precinct
I'm back in the G-bent
Black wit the pre-tint
Vanilla aroma to cover the back with the tree scent
The way I ride I know I'm in for a case
But the coupe do 200 so they in for a chase
When it comes to lawyers I got the man Puff uses
Thats why you never seen my wrists with handcuff bruises
I got them hollow tips.. to stick up in the AR's
Detectors in the dash.. to pick up on the radar
Stash box in it when I purchased the vehicle
So I don't have a problem wit you searching the vehicle
They probably want to scoop an arrest
I try to throw shots but its cool, I got a coupe like a vest
And 'em troopers will just feel stupid I guess
The slugs will bounce off like they hittin superman's chest.. nigga

[Hook]

Cop: Look take it from Larry lock the rapper, get the fuck outta here
I don't wanna see you around here again. and by the way
