[Ice Cube Talking]
Dear Mum, If some people came by the house lookin for me
I'm innocent of anything they say I done
Now I don't know when I'll be able to write you again
But I will be back to California to see you
Your son, Ice-motherfucking-Cube

[Hook 1]
Keep my hand on my gun cos they got me on the run
I swear I didn't do what they say I done (x2)

[Verse 1]
Ghetto destroyer, paranoia, I need a lawyer
This bitch named Netoia, say they lookin for ya
Got to get the fuck out of here (yeah right)
This bitch dimmed the lights (nigga, spend the night)
Bust a quick nut, got to fuck up and gat on
Cos this the same street I got shot on
So God bless the Impala double-S
I gotta holla cos I'm smokin on double breasts
Tweakin, niggaz be leakin, information
Got the feds seekin, incarceration
Niggaz say my name popped up
Bitch hop up
Nigga close the shop up
They tryina stop up my cashflow
Leave me asshole naked (fuck!)
Gone in sixty seconds, burn all records
Nigga gettin skinny eating Denny's
Count my pennies, only got a bag fulla twenties

[Hook 2]
Listen, these Feds fishin for this extradition
I'm on a mission, fuck 'em, fight 'em, dodge 'em, ditch 'em
I gotta kick rocks, I can't pick locks
Or spend the rest of my life in a shit-box

[Verse 2]
It's so hard to get a room without a credit card
It's so hard not to let 'em know where you are
Tried to get a Rent-A-Car
Whitey laughed when I showed him cash
Had to mash 'fore he called the Feds on my ass
Went to Vegas for the weekend
Met a ho down for freakin
Hey bitch, why you sneakin?
Grabbed the paper out her hand
Am I the man on the front page? (Fuck!)
Same height, same age (click-click)
Rap gauge, put it down the G-way
Got my hostage suckin sausage on the freeway
She say let's hit or suck ok?
Ran inside and made the niggaz all pay
It's like I hit the Lotto outside Colorado
Brought a ??? for his wallet and my votto
That's my motto and I gotta warn ya
Before I'm through, I'm going back to California

[Hook 1]
[Hook 2]

[Verse 3]
My boys, Utah to Illinois
Settin decoys, so I can infiltrate
All fifty states
Can't wait till I'm back on my feet
Switch and shake this bitch in her sleep
Low key you feds can't see me
All up in D.C. with strike number three
Clownin, made a little stock to get a little cock
Now I got niggaz bangin in Little Rock
I'm going back to Cali westbound with my strikes
Don't give a fuck who's on the marin or the mic
I should've known when I seen that motherfucker in the lobby
looking like he wanna rob me (Fuck!)
Federal, don't like no black hetero-sexual, intellectual
Tried to turn me into a vegetable
An I'm 'a sue all black and blue
When I come to-hand cuff (Fuck y'all!)
Big grey bus, scandalous (Fuck you too!)
Cos they can't stand us
They get excited and I tried to fight it (mama)
I'm going back to Cali for sure, extradited

[Ice Cube talking]
Hey mama, when y'all send pictures you can't send a polaroid
Got to be the regular pictures
An' they got us in here puttin' in computer chips or something
I don't know. Like they playin with us, it's like a game
It ain't nuttin' but a game to them mama
It's my life</pre>
