I look up

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Tequila glasses, shots to the head cause some memories they need assassins
Got a quarter pound of purp an eigth of gin I have my friends
Gone, Gone
Man fuck it though, not too good with fractions
Tried to do it all on my own, not too good with asking
Cause when people give you a hand they want an audience back
But they not clapping and standing, they clapping at me let's panic
Pop pop that AK take candids
I aim for the sky, never landed
And yup
I look up up up in the mirror, I see a nigga gettin' rich off me
Hmm, and look at all these mother fuckers trynna get rich off me
But they wasn't there not when times got heavy man when things got deadly
Before my cash flow broke that levy man we ain't have no heat in that broke ass Chevy
Coming from a city where dreams get shredded, I'm goin off credit, these niggas need debit
Made mistakes but they made me what I am and I am what I am and I don't regret it
And I found the girl that I'd marry, the only curse
Is that I keep running into the girls that I'd fuck first

[Bridge]
But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs
For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all?
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?

Fuck nah
Trynna make it out a city where niggas don't make it out
And if you do they want the blueprint so they can try and trace it out
They got that work, and thank God for yay
Signed to G.O.O.D, thank God for Ye
Before it's all said and done the one thing that I gotta say is

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Man I miss my grandma, she ain't passed away or nothin I'm just busy on camera
I love her, I love her, I should call her up and tell her
Give her some flowers, while she can still smell em
While she can still smell em, If you love somebody please tell em
I swear if you had 24 hours tell me who or what you'd do
Would you spend it all with your fam or would you get high with your crew?
Would you go back to your old girl and let her know that it's true?
Would you go back to your old boss and piss all over his shoes?
Would you, try and make the news? Would you get paid? Would you try to pay your dues?
Would you step it up or would you try and change shoes? Do you believe in karma or living for tomorrow?
Would you, hit the bar and go binging? Would you, steal a car, Mercedez Benz? and
Would you die alone, would you die independent? Or would have your friends right there in attendance
When it's all finished
Guess that depends on how you live
Just pray that all of your wrongs don't overshadow all that you did

[Bridge]
But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs
For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all?
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now </pre>
