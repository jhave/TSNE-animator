Typed by: fywhla@yahoo.com

[Chorus]
Reason to panic
(Motion unchained with no surveillance)
Reason to panic
(Better duck when you see me comin')
Reason to panic
(Heaters fully raised up out the trunk)
Reason to panic, reason to panic

[E-40]
Motion, win-lose-or-draw, I'ma jump in it regardless
Show these squares a box of fruit loops, who's the hardest?
Put on my clown suit and get to clownin', like Circus Vargas
If I was a tool in the shed I'd be the sharpest
Rap without E-40 is like wine without grapes
A lot of rappers, get they game from my tapes
Through these L-I-P's, I spit like a AK
Off with his head, he wasn't usin' it anyway
I'ma do the damn thing, 'til I'm old and grey
I'm good, even on a bad hair day
When the Ballatician talks, people listen
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto like Church's Chicken

[Motion Man]
Yo, in with my lecture, my lecture will indeed infect ya
Disease is stifling, like rednecks go out on riflings (yee haw!)
Like Puerto rocks (fisk fisk) for knifings
Runnin' human train like Dane did for Wisconsin
Now which one's game to catch Tyson speed to the eye
like Mitch Green on any beat
Real relaxed with mystique, that woman's ass is petite
Motion a full gorilla, full killa, full dealer
Believe me partner, I'm a full blooded
full gutted, duel nutted - fool from The Bay-yay
Who will run it day to day, strong armin', come alarmin'
Fade you like you drank forty Tom Collins at the club high

[Chorus]
Reason to panic
(Motion unchained with no surveillance)
Reason to panic
(Better duck when you see me comin')
Reason to panic
(Heaters fully raised up out the trunk)
Reason to panic, reason to panic
Reason to panic
(Motion unchained with no surveillance)
Reason to panic
(Sayin' "Feezy I ain't startin' somethin")
Reason to panic
(Heaters fully raised up out the trunk)
Reason to panic, reason to panic

[Motion Man]
Carefully packaged hazmat like a FedEx pick-up
Up every sleeve I got a trick up
Offensive minded like I'm Brian Billick
Raven style, soar the field like Ray Lewis hit ya
It's Big Pelon aka Chef Hannibal Lecture
I bring the flav' and spices to the kid who thinks he's nicest
Bald headed, scary man, say your prayers at night it's
Reason to panic, with E-40 blitz you boss like I'm Adrian Ross
Dearly beloved, take the barrel of this gun and suck it
I blow your head to smithereens like a magazine
And put out my own magazine and circulate it through your town on you
First issue titled "Nicely Broken Down On You"

[E-40]
I promise to never break a promise
All I do is eat, sleep, and breathe ebonics
A fire starter like Fredro Star from Onyx
I got a partner named G, play for the Sonics
I'm addictive like J.R. Rider and chronic
I drink liquor, preferably Gin &amp; Tonic
Empty stomach hangover, sometimes I vomit
And when I leave the vocal booth gon' be haunted

[Chorus]
Reason to panic
(Motion unchained with no surveillance)
Reason to panic
(Better duck when you see me comin')
Reason to panic
(Heaters fully raised up out the trunk)
Reason to panic, reason to panic
[Chorus]
Reason to panic
(Motion unchained with no surveillance)
Reason to panic
(Better duck when you see me comin')
Reason to panic
(Heaters fully raised up out the trunk)
Reason to panic, reason to panic
Reason to panic
(Motion unchained with no surveillance)
Reason to panic
(Sayin' "Feezy I ain't startin' somethin")
Reason to panic
(Heaters fully raised up out the trunk)
Reason to panic, reason to panic</pre>
