"Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-od-DAMN!!  Shee-yee-YIT!!  Look at the ass
on that bitch!  Look at the titties!"

(Mixx scratches "Aw hit me!" and "Hold your legs up on easy.")

Verse 1
[FKI]  There's only one place where we can go
       To see freaky hoes doin' shows
       Doin' tricks to make us holler
       On a giving night, all for a dollar
       Silicone breasts, all on their chests
       Nothin' like others, but above the rest
       They'll do anything to turn us on
       Them hoes got it goin' on!!
[BM]   I like big booty and big ol' titties
       Bitch, you know you've been fucked by many
       So come and be my private dancer
       I got some money if that's the answer
       I really wanna be with you; 
       I get hard after seeing you
       How hard?  Hard like a rock, 
       When you make that pussy pop!

Chorus(2x):  Luke
Pop that pussy!  Heyyy!  Pop that pussy, baby!
Pop that pussy!  Pop, pop that pussy, baby!

Verse 2
[FKI]  Freaky bitches with plenty of ass
       Rollin' to the music and shakin' real fast
       Bend over backwards, make me shout
       And work that pussy, in and out
       Movin' their body with plenty of action
       Bringin' to the men more satisfaction
       Doin' what they feel to turn us out
       Just work that pussy all the way out!
[BM]   Shake it!  Don't break it!
       It took your momma nine months to make it
       Bend over and spread 'em, girl
       Show-w-w me those pussy pearls
       Rub that ass and play with that clit
       You know I like that freaky shit
       Girl, you know you look so cute
       Throwin' that pussy the way you do!

Chorus

Verse 3
[FKI]  Poppin' that pussy's a dance for the ladies
       Straight from the South, into the 90's
       Freaky bitches are the ones I like
       In G-strings in the middle of the night
       Smoke-filled stages, bitches in cages
       Guards at the door, armed with gauges
       As they dance and I get hot,
       Keep throwin' that pussy!  Don't stop!
[BM]   I like the way you lick the champagne glass
       It makes me wanna stick my dick in your ass
       So come on, baby, and pop it quick
       I fall in love when you suck my dick
       Bitch, you don't know?  You ain't heard?
       Fuckin' with me, you're gonna get served
       See, none of my bitches, they never complain
       So come on, baby, and pop that thang!

Chorus

Luke:
Janet J, pop, that pus-sy!
Bu-bles, pop, that pus-sy!
Sandra P, pop, that pus-sy!
Ma-donna, pop that stinky smelly pussy, baby!

(Mixx scratches "Work this motherfucker!"  "Shit, this good!"  "Woo hoo!")

Chorus

Luke:
BREAKDOWN!!</pre>
