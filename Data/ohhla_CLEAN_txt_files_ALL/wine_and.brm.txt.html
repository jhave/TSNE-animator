[Verse One: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! Baby girl let me take you to the essence (Uh huh)
Gift wrapped with a ribbon girl your in my presence (Ok)
Look at me and let the vision deliver the message
And ready to lead your dude listen and give me a second

[Verse Two: Vybz Kartel]
Hello baby gyal mi waan yuh

Wine yuh waist baby mi waan yuh

[Verse Three: Busta Rhymes]
Aiyyo you see the way I come in and how I creep up behind 'em
Like I'm aimin with a rifle comin to seekin to find 'em
So many mami's let me go in just wine 'em and dine 'em
Ass big, now I'm ready to go mountain climb 'em 
Ask Spliff, the model agency now let me sign 'em
'Cause they beautiful like they Botanical Garden asylum
While they be with they chicks and they busy tryin to hide 'em
You know your nigga lame you ain't feel him standin beside 'em

[Chorus: Female]
