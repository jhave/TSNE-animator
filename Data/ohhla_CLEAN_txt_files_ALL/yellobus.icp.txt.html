[Shaggy 2 Dope]
When I was a little boy they used to laugh at the mini bus
We was special wasn't many of us
Where did we get to go all day? We went to happy land
See me pressed up on the glass smillin' waving my hand
I like y'all in a hurry tryin' ta get to go where y'all go
Our little special yellow bus grip through town extra slow
We don't get shot in our class we happy all damn day
You see the little yellow bus comin' fuck out the way

[Violent J]
I'm in the little yellow bus who wants us to pick 'em up
Come on
Scoop us up
Come on and scoop us up
I'm in the little yellow bus who wants us to pick 'em up
Come on
Scoop us up
Come on and scoop us up

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
All these bitches never see me I waggle my penis
I'm ridding in the little yellow bus 'cause I'm a fucking genius
We got our own class and y'all ain't got ta pass
You might see us threw window if ya cut across the grass
But that's all you will get we on some high level shit
Get back to your class with the masses where you're easy to forget
I'm in the little yellow bus ridding on that bitch laughing
Oblivious to the wicked world outside and what's happenin'

[Violent J]
I'm in the little yellow bus who wanna ride wit me
Come on
Scoop us up
Come on and scoop us up
I'm in the little yellow bus who wanna ride wit me
Come on
Scoop us up
Come on and scoop us up

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Lights flash when we grippin' by 'cause we in here whillin'
We livin' on our own shit while y'all worry 'bout stylin'
We ridin' on past sometimes haters try to diss us
By we so fucking happy we can't help but let it miss us
We floating on the chain we ain't gotta maintain
We in our little yellow bus 'cause we ain't the same
We out here bendin' corners and we ain't fucking with stress
And where we're headed that's for only us to know and you to guess

[Violent J]
I'm in the little yellow bus who wants us to pick 'em up
Come on
Scoop us up
Come on and scoop us up
I'm in the little yellow bus who wants us to pick 'em up
Come on
Scoop us up
Come on and scoop us up
I'm in the little yellow bus who wanna ride wit me
Come on
Scoop us up
Come on and scoop us up
I'm in the little yellow bus who wanna ride wit me
Come on
Scoop us up
Come on and scoop us up
The little yellow bus
Scoop us up
Come on and scoop us up
The little yellow bus
Uh
Scoop us up (come on)
Come on and scoop us up (come on)</pre>
