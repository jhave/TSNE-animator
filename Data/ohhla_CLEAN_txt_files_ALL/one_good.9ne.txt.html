Just give me one good time
Nobody is looking at me anyway
Nobody is looking at me anyway
Yo
Yo

[Verse 1]
I know that I'm hardcore
Know how to start wars
Know how to scar yours in a fist fight
Cause toughness is our floor
Warriors that bar nor
But this one is far tore up on this night
Some people show it and then
Some people hide it
But other people they do it whenever they get excited but me
I can't even do it when the wrongs on mine
I'm saying I've been trying to do it for a long long time
I get jealous when I see people do it and it's like fluid
I'm thinking
How can they swallow that when I can't even chew it
I guess God seen it fit to label me the consoler
Bestowed upon a broken show and forever be the shoulder
My mission is plain to see
Its freaking insanity
I'm wishing the pain in me would just leave me be why can't it be
Simple cause on the real
This one could die
So I'm asking God
Before I go
Just give me one good cry

[Chorus]
If I could cry maybe one good time I could wash away all my pain
And maybe free my mind
After my shows it's a lonely road
So I sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
Nobody's looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time
Nobody's looking at me anyway

[Verse 2]
Why I got to be the one to cheer up
People till they clear up
When I sneeze I tear up
And then I go look in a mirror
So I can see how it looks
When I really wanna know how it feels
When I'm hella down I try to push
No matter how hard no water spills for real
My patience is soon to go
Waiting for the balloon to blow
I'm thinking back to when I used to go to funerals
No matter how close we were
On the inside it ached "wow"
Others be losing it
I'm just wishing I could break down
And I been thru a lot of them
And there's not a one
That went on and got it done
No moisture that even try even to come
And this ain't no chump thing, because I've had enough pain
Tears should be run-in like mustangs
Man it must rain
Been trying for years
But the crying been inside
Nina been so serious there ain't no lying in his eyes
Makes me so furious
When I look and I'm in genocide
Please let me break down with the pain I felt when Brian Dennis died
One time..

[Chorus]
If I could cry maybe one good time I could wash away all my pain
And maybe free my mind
After my shows it's a lonely road
Sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
Nobody's looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time
Nobody's looking at me anyway

[Verse 3]
I look at actors crying
It's as easy as fondue
But what do you do when extreme hurt is ipon you
Real life ain't no movie homie
And this ain't John Woo
But I almost lost it on the ending of Jon Q
And I almost lost it when Jennifer Hudson blew
But I'm still waiting for that real emotion to come thru
Then maybe I could get a cry God
Maybe one, two?
Been red for life for the first time ever me want blue
Give me the blues
Sometimes I turn on the news and I
Look at all these feuds
Then I try to make them ooze
(Don't cry, no teardrops from your eye
poerty's music oh my, almost made me tear up about thinking about my children, no lie)
Maybe I'm black hearted
You thinking damn he shady
Saying man he crazy
For the way I abandon me lady
One day she can repay me
Yes that woman can betray me
Then I'll probably cry if not than I do it if I win me a Grammy maybe

[Chorus]
If I could cry maybe one good time I could wash away all my pain
And maybe free my mind
After my shows it's a lonely road
Sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
Nobody's looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time
Nobody's looking at me anyway</pre>
