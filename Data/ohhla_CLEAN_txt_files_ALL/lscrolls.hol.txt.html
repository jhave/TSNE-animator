[Intro: G-Clef Da Mad Komposa, (Holocaust)]
Yo Pro, Scrolls, (American Poets) Check it out
Last night I had this vision, Above the mountain tops
A giant face was revealing all these sacred things to me
It was something like

[C-Rayz Walz]
These are the pamphlets, The original pages of Hamlet
Old sages, wicked women dancing naked and bathing
Wicked men enchanted, The force of the eagles advances
Sight throughout sound, Lay everything to canvas
They burn down our schools in attempt to rule the planet
Question the answers, A blessing, 
Truth be told, A testament stranded
You fold, The wizard's wardrobe, I rest lungs
Blast yall without guns, Single handed
The Heaven push whips, I grip elephant trunk
Clutching my nuts, My cut celebant but I'm never selling out
Plus I evolve elegance, My iller mob a militant bunch
American Poets' flows be killing kids when it's crunk
And if the volts are frightening, You dodging bolts of lightning
Vultures know the code when I'm writing the poltergeist, Poseidon
My sixteen slip screams, With beams, That relate to Earth
Because if I spit a quasar bar God, Your face'll burst
Smoking reefer, You approach a _______
Motions of oceans, Get sea sick and sick Caesar
On some hail Julius, Hell no, The _______
Harpoons, Hennessey, Hail storms and wide receivers
Patient so Easter, When the crop circles burst with sativa
Irreversible curses from the verses of leaders
When the five affiliates live elements will hold The Panthers
The soul enchanters, Will find the lost scrolls of Atlantis

[Atlantis Scrolls]
Looking at the night sky, Bright lights
See the white lies, The truth is in my eyes
You can't deny, That I'm sick with the skills
Pass me an Advil pill, I'm too ill
I'm the epitome of what's considered real
World war tragedy, Wu-Tang fans are mad at me
For working with their favorite artist from the academy
Come battle me, I'll shatter the with apathy rapidly
With kinetic staff mastery I'll shut down the radio
Nothing but hypeness coming from my stereo
You thought I was wack, But yet, You bit the flow
Copied my style like I didn't know
Yall a bunch a bitches, Some fake ass Christians
I even caught you on your own contradictions
I used to listen to you when growing up
Now I'm holding the mic telling you to shut the fuck up

[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
Yo, Check it out
what happened to the flow, What happened to the knowledge
What happened to the culture that schooled kids like college
what happened to the message, What happened to dope beats
When did being skilled get replaced by being street
(Tonk Tonk) G-Clef the engineer to the planets
I never rap in Japanese when you listen in Spanish
Music is the universal language, 
Some people say that certain tones can alter molecular of your break
Matter, Keep it smatter, I mean smarter, We can barter
But it's harder to do order when your heart is filled with order
Or you wanna kill somebody out some jealousy and slaughter
You your own worst enemy when you think you going harder
(So check it out) I bury the scrolls under the temple
(Can you dig it) A relic from the golden age, So turn the page
There's a cipher code key with symbols so you can read
Now I pass the scrolls over to Pro, So he can lead

[Pro the Leader]
Dispel the myth, Inhale the spliff, The ______ ______ ______
Your style is irrelevant, Save yourself the embarrassment
Stop embellishing, Where my new era went
You made an error in judgment when doubting my ability
Your not iller then me, And no man is in the possession of invincibility
Dashingly villainy delivery
Yo and I'm so ill, I'm sick of dealing with emcees
Evaluate our terraces, Until all wackness perishes
Don't start with loan sharks, Get hit, Bones part
I own art, In the form of poetry, Cold heart
You waft through a slow start
Don't bother trying to finish, I will win this
You are winless, Came close within inches
Everyone awaiting my entrance
Crowd applause, Serpents hisses
You are unworthy, On track to be performing disses

[Holocaust]
Believe in vampires had existed from the earliest times
And has given rise to many legends, A fist full of dynamite
The evolution of sports and guns desolate
They are most commonly thought of as spirits or demons
That left their graves at night
To seek and enslaves their victims to the masses, With fright
It was thought that the victims themselves became vampires
Over a campfire at night, Thirty-six hours to landfall
My verbal weapon room, They'll be expecting you
Blood on the window smeared, The cops wondering what happened here
The Amazons, One of the tribe of war like women, Who lived in Asia Minor
The Amazons had a society in which women fought and governed
While men preformed household tasks, 
I defeat a vengeful army of Amazons, At Athens I laugh
From the dawn of time people have believed angels walk among us</pre>
