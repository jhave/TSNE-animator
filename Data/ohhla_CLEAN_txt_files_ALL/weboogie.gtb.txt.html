[Scarface]
Gangsters don't dance pop, we boogie on some hard shit
Fuck the V.I.P., we buy the bar
and it's a party goin on, but we came in here to close it
Twenty niggaz deep in the corner ready to roll shit
They dancin freaky, lookin sleazy as fuck
Ass bouncin everywhere, tryin to tease me with butt
But we ain't drinkin, we just chillin, we ain't sweatin these hoes
And I ain't here to answer questions, I'm just lettin you know
that if your cousin got a label or your partner can rap
Nigga cool, do your thizzle, give your partner some dap
But if you come up in this muh'fucker cappin in here
Man you ain't gon' believe what's fin' to happen in here
I'm a Southside nigga representin the good
For the North East and West side keepin it hood
Dirty wit it, I don't hesitate to put it to work
Pussy niggaz on that bullshit get put in the dirt
So recognize what I be about, I'm mobbin for life
Geto Boys back together bitch, we squabbin tonight
Got the whole hood ridin cause we keepin it street
FaceMob, Chuck boogie, Willie D to the beat

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We don't dance, we boogie - ride, we boogie
Ball, we boogie - shine, we boogie
So up jump the boogie, and straight hood boogie
I'm a real nigga gangsters don't dance, we boogie

[Bushwick Bill]
Chuck Nice still in it, I ain't switchin it up
Weed smokin in the boys room, livin it up
Blue suits lookin stupid, I ain't givin a fuck
5th Ward, bloody nickel got me hittin it what
I'ma move it to the back, I wanna look at the show
See this chick I used to mash comin up through the do'
I approach her on some cool shit, I'm walkin her in
I'm in town for a minute and I'm wantin a friend
Fire up another phillie, steady feedin her lies
Eyes rollin to the back of her head, she was high
She was stupid like a snake, steady lickin her lips
{?} drugs up out the bird, so I pull out my dick
Started flashin at the party, I was drunk as a fuck
Full of weed, 'bout to conceive and twist it in public
'Til this chick walked in, said she's lovin the show
Started askin me to dance, I was tellin her noooooooo!

[Chorus]

[Willie D]
Walk through the do' and the DJ announce
Stop the motherfuckin music, Willie D in the house
He backed on it with my jam, that nigga was cool
He wasn't a bitch-ass ho like some of these fools
Keep the waitress on her toes, tipped her a bank
Northside niggaz just love to crank
Does any one of y'all fools up in here got a gripe?
We kickin y'all motherfuckin ass tonight
Come at me sideways, I don't care if you law
I'm a dot that eye, and check that jaw
Dragged across the bar top partner
Slam you on the dance flo' and stomp the shit out ya
Somebody give me a drink to calm me down
It can be Wild Turkey, gin or Crown
I like 'em big, don't fuck with malnourished chicks
Now shake that ass you dirty bitch

[Chorus]

Nigga!  Side to side, drinkin hand, understand?
Y'all motherfuckin niggaz be, backin that thang up, runnin hoppin
Whistle while you twerkin and, motherfuckin sissy-boyin
Real men bout it, you ain't even supposed to be able to move like that</pre>
