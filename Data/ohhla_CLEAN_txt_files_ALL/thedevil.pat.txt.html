I'm wakin out of my sleep 
And I'm thinkin 
I'm dreamin 
I feel like I'm goin insane 
I can just feel 
The presence of an unknown spirit inside me controllin my brain 
Tryin to get me to commit bloody murder 
For money and set niggas up on that stain 
Visions of demons be screamin 
And fiendin for spirits 
Some niggas that fucked up the game 
I'm comin out of my bed 
With a head full of thoughts 
That might get me locked up in a cell 
Lookin for weapons 
I'm steppin up off 
And I'm caught when I'm lost 
I'm exhausted as well 
Suddenly out of the ground 
A vision appears 
It's such a demonly form 
Thunder and lightning so frightening 
And darkness cover the sky 
While my body is warm 
I feel like I'm goin insane 
I feel no pain 
I wanna break free but I'm frozen 
Am I forbidden to die 
By the fact that I'm trapped 
By curse of the devil has chosen 
All of my for real all my nigga 
The spirit is bigger that life and larger than death 
I'm hidin 
I'm hydro ventilating 
Waitin for satin to show 
And I'm holdin my breath 
But will he appear 
Will he just come and collect 
Elements from my body and soul 
Or will he come kill me 
And drill me 
With teeth in my stomach 
And pump me 
Goin to be until I become swolle 
I'm tyin to be brave 
And I fear no evil 
For nothing 
Cause I know that he's on a hunt 
I pull out a swisher 
And split it 
And lit it 
And hit it 
And pass the devil a blunt 

Let me hit that 
This is some good shit 
Wrong again mother fucker 

The devil got high 
And we sat and talked about life 
And I asked hI'm was hell any fun 
He told me it would be 
Chaos killin stealin dealin 
And murder from dusk until dawn 
Then he said demons 
Would come from the streets 
Like police and kill anyone seen doin good 
Crack would given to people that's livin 
? 
That walk through the hood 
He spoke about so many things that sounded like a lie 
So I said to myself this ain't real 
He found out that I was in doubt 
And he jumped in my spirit 
And he made me rupture and kill 
Innocent people for nothin 
I pulled out my glock 
And started bustin at woman at random 
And I'm spittin off Images 
Faces out callers 
Cause its true 
I really can't stand them 
Catchin up niggas 
It's perfect 
Cause I got the erg 
And I'm fillin up 
And holes in my head 
Rewrite the exorcist 
Next is the school with I. Q. 
With my nine up and I fill full of lead 
The devil jumped out of me 
Then he appeared and showed me pictures of the bodies I slayed 
I couldn't believe what I did 
So I tried to break free 
But he captured me just like a slave 
He took me to ten 
He told me to look down 
And there I was standing on my grave 
I tried to jump up but I couldn't 
I started sinking 
I'm thinking I gotta stay brave 
I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere 
With nothin but fighting 
I pray for the demons on hunt 
But that's what I get for thinking I could sit with the devil 
And joke and smoke on a blunt 

(Laughs) 
You stupid mother fucker 
(Laughs) 
Your gunna burn 
Your gunna burn! 
(Laughs) 

The devil took me to a spot 
And I watched as he sacrificed 
So many souls of the living 
The nigga that that's one with no heart 
And niggas that kill 
Are considered t be a forgiven 
They put them on crosses 
And burn them with children 
And I watch as they blow 
And go up in smoke 
The stench from the bodies so strong and 
It's making me sick to my stomach 
As I start to choke 
I'm tremblin and shakin 
And feelin so strange 
And I'm changin into somehtin 
What's goin on 
My soul has been takin control of 
With all of the haters inside me 
Makin me do wrong 
The devils a serpent 
Inside me I feel hI'm 
Well what should I do 
Should I stop and give in 
Or should I just pray to the man in the sky 
Before I die and he makes me commit a sin 
I'm askin for help 
And I'm screamin out 
AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! 
(Laughs) 

2X 
As I lay me down to sleep 
I pray the lord my soul to keep 
If I die before I wake 
I pray the lord m soul to take 

In other words nigga (echoed) 
You need to quit smokin blunts with the mother fucking devil (echoed) 
Believe that shit (echoed) 
The devil a low down mother fucker (echoed) 
He ain'ts to be fucked with (echoed) 
Take it from me nigga (echoed) 
Believe that shit nigga (echoed) 
Trademark shit of the beast  (echoed) 
Fuck the world  (echoed) 
And I'm out  (echoed) </pre>
