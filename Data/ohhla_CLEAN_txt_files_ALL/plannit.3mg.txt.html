The planet
I handle it
Infinitive 
Climate
Inventive

[Chorus] [x2]
Rest my legs off (the planet)
Worlds my easel
(I handle it)
Gods my mind state (Infinitive)
Arts my climate
(Inventive)

[x2]
Left, right
Stay on track
Push on, forward march
Don't fall back
Keep moving

[Verse One] [MURS]
My brigade won't be swayed or made to be afraid 
Head high hearts humble righteous men don't parade 
Stood silence in the shadows 
Steady building up my rage 
And it's too late to counter once the move has been made 
Like Aragorn call them ghosts off the ship 
We gon' slide through your city start tearing up shit 
Destroying ring wraiths that bring fake hymns 
Singing praises to these demons named Cash and Gems
We smash such pens 
And flash grim grins 
As we administer a sinister fate to men 
Who have a transgressed and refused to transcend 
The confines of the state of mind they in 
The path has been laid the gauntlet thrown down 
The power so potent when I'm playin' with pronouns 
It's like a healing potion when the poetry put down 
Elixir
That's a mixture with the word 
And this verb combined in my mind 
Until it's stirred 
Brain left scrambled so they label me disturbed 
Tray in your face, get it straight we don't get served
Orel MURSheiser on the mound with a sick curve
Thoughts thrown swift so your vision might get blurred
Get nerve 
Get gone 
Or go home
I'm headed for the rim gonna claim a gold throne
So hold on 
Or come along if you feel this
But on this journey we'll encounter some realness
There's drama there's pain 
There's death there's illness
But 3M Generals will lead individuals to a positive called change
Give you confidence in the rain
Bring your tolerance to the pain
I'm polish this insane 
So when you play this song and recite this rhyme 
You open up your heart and you soul starts to shine
For the journey is the struggle but the movement is divine

[x8]
Left, right
Stay on track
Push on, forward march
Don't fall back
Keep moving

[Chorus] [x2]
Rest my legs off (the planet)
Worlds my easel
(I handle it)
Gods my mind state (Infinitive)
Arts my climate
