[Intro: Dré]
This is, this is, this is, this is
We are not the same I am a martian
We are not the same I am a martian

[Female voice talking]
Greetings from planet Weezy, we will begin transmission in
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[Chorus: Dré &amp; Lil Wayne]
PHONE HOME, WEEZY
PHONE HOME, WEEZY
PHONE HOME, WEEZY
PHONE HOME, WEEZY
And if you feel like the best, go 'head and do the Wezzy we and
PHONE HOME, WEEZY 
PHONE HOME, WEEZY

[Lil Wayne]
We are not the same I am a martian
And I'm hotter than summer rain like Carl Thomas
Lock, load, ready to aim at any target
I could get your brains for a bargain
Like I bought it from target
Hip hop is my supermarket
Shopping cart full of fake hip hop artists
I'm starving, sorry I gotta eat all it
And I'll be back in the morning

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
We are not the same I am a alien
Like Gonzales, young college student who done
Just flipped the game like Houston, I'm used to
Promethazine in two cups I'm screwed up
And you ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up
Flow so sick make you wanna throw your food up
Ice water chest, and my wrist like a cool cup
Two twin clippers, I give your ass a crew cut
I get bread like cold cuts you know what?
Your girl go down fast, come up slow, but I never slow up
Weezy

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
They don't make 'em like me no more
Matter fact, they never made it like me before
I'm rare like Mr. Clean with hair
No break lights on my car rear
I never hade life, and I never had fear
I rap like I done died and gone to heaven I swear
And yeah I'm a bear like black and white hair
So I'm polar
And they can't get on my system 'cause my system is the solar
I am so far from the outhers, I mean others
I could eat them for supper, get in my spaceship and hover, hover

[Chorus]</pre>
