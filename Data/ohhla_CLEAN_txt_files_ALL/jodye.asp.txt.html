[Verse 1]
Bitch motherfuckers trying to fake it trill
Sneak diss you just to make a bill, now the world won't take you serious
When I met you, you was painting nails
Leave a motherfucker layin' still, bang him with the stainless steel
Cause I'm making the order
Laugh at the altar, pullin' a Lord up
Don't get someone sawed up
Your brain in a sawdust, niggas is washed up
I bang out in Florida
Streets of Miami, goons out in Georgia
Been to New Orleans
But still a New Yorker, nigga the talk of
Town, nigga we bossed up
Bounce, but when you talk to the Lord
Of course you're forced to
Bow down like a motherfuckin' peasant
Still that pretty motherfucker
And you know Harlem's what I'm reppin' nigga

[Chorus]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my niggas, I'll die for my niggas
Man, fuck them other niggas!

Please talk to me lord, I am here for you lord

[Verse 2]
Gettin' faded, hair gettin' braided
Sophie sniffed a line of ye
Playin' spades, bumpin' Jimi Hendrix "Purple Haze"
A 40 to the face, call my homies from around the way
Give me that pussy, I'll be on my way
But grab the jimmy so the bitch don't get no cash up out me
Pretty nigga, I'm a jiggy nigga, ask about me
Fuck niggas talkin' trash about me
But you know I toke a gauge, it can make any problem go away
Talkin' Jay, talkin' Ye, that mean you niggas talkin' cray
Razor blade across your face, I fix my face then walk away
I guess then there's nothin' more to say
Trill nigga to the death, whether Hell or the pearly gates
I think back to my early days
Whippin' and pinchin' that broad dough
It's a bit different now, switchin' and flippin' that raw flow
Substance get me higher, reefer and some fire
The devil is a liar, biased preachers shall retire
Jesus walked on water, I'm preachin' to the choir
Long live A$AP, now bow to your Messiah, bitch!

Let the Lords toast with the Lords
Toast to the Lords
We come Gods, come Lords
Lords! Lords! Lords!
Oh Lord! Toast to the Lords!
As we [?] this day, please pray for us
When comes the saints, comes the evils, brings the Lords</pre>
