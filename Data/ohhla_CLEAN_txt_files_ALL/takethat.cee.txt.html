[Missy]
Yo party people in da house
Yo bang that shit
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang that shit
Zhiggy, zhiggy, zhiggy, zhiggy, zhiggy, zhiggy, uh

[TC](Missy)
When I had no dough
And I was low
She didn't want me
(What'cha say T?)
When I didn't buy her clothes
From the store
She wouldn't flaunt me (Uh)
Now I bag up all the hoes and I know
That she digs me
(What'cha say boo?)
She ripped me off like clothes
I suppose
(Yo zhiggy, zhiggy take that)

1 - [TC]
    Take that, get back
    Dumb chicks tryna take my scratch
    Hey trick, get back
    Unless you gon let me hit that
    Take that, get back
    Dumb chicks tryna take my scratch
    Hey trick, get back
    Cuz I might have to...

[Missy]
Zhiggy, zhiggy, zhiggy uh yo
Bang that shit, bang, bang, bang that shit

[TC](Missy)
When I had no car, no car
She wouldn't call me
(What'cha got boo?)
Now she think I'm a star

Now she follow me (he-he, uh)
Had to change all my codes
To my phones (yo)
Coulda had me first, me first
(Yo, so you tell her, uh)

This is for the playa in you
