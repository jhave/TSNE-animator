[Popa Wu]
Yeah, yeah, y'all
This is the famous Popa Wu
You know how it go down baby
You understand? The Remarkable Timing by the 60 Second Assassin baby
We coming thru man live, just live baby
We doing our thang now, man
Coming straight from the mind, straight with the math
You understand?
We gon' put it in for y'all right now
You understand?
We gon' take it all thru the degree of knowledge man
And bring it back man to the foundation

(Hook) Jay-Z sample
"When I rhyme with Remarkable Timing"

[Masta Killa]
One-two, now, one-two, now, listen
Meditation soul for strings, wisdom overflowing, mind blowing
60 Sec, Masta with the Bronze Naz classic Chamber Musik rapture
Before the laughter came tears love hella right
Black, brown, red, yellow, white
My mic bless nations with the perfect timing
Lyrics build the universal thought
Rhyming is the leads, my magnetic substance is speech
Attracted a-alike
Now ladies when you hear the God speak squeeze ya legs tight
This is Irief, you know what I bring
The murder word play, intensity danger
Chi-Town P-Stone Ranger
Teach the truth, Black!
United we can fight it, divided, well you know what that do
When crews separate hate, when family suffer, friends kill friends
Brothers gotta stand together
We can make it, take it to another level
Peace to Rebel INS

[M-Eighty]
It's so remarkable, spark-able up the world and arsenal
Dutch, chuch, phenomenal, crush, rush the silent hill
The timing I'm in, has got me vibing on assignment
Where all the livest live men, silent upon my entrance
That too, formerly introduce heavy on revenue
Who generate only new cuz you never knew
The history, the chapters, the saga, the seconds after
I almost called it quits, and realized that I'm the ...
High exalted, yet falter, slaughtered the Almighty Titan
Keep fighting the good fight, and prosper in Remarkable Timing

[60 Second Assassin]
60 Sec, for creating the impossible
Remarkable Timing, concoctional
Bullshit can step into my arch of flow
Non-un-lockable, my hourglass still tick-tock-able
Like some of y'all birds I know they stay flock-able
Coo-coo cuz I still lock in the sock, you know
Made contracts but fuck everything optional
Fuck an infrared I got you cross-line telescopical
You know you here today but gon' tomorrow
You know like years took hip-hop ago
Nothing right now is really marketable
All talk is philosophical
60 Sec they scared to death, I'm unstoppable
How you gon' stop every Sec can stop a flow
My mission impossible, I'm hard to kill
Somebody guard his grill and let him know that God is real
Time be the master of illusion
Cause the level of our mind stay grooving
Never be no time to be losing
Only once in the time shall be proving
Time be the master of illusion
Cause the level of our mind stay grooving
Never be no time to be losing
Only once in the time shall be proving

Popa Wu baby
Remarkable Timing, 60 Second Assassin
Straight from the mind
We gon' put it in for y'all right now
You understand?
We gon' take it all thru the degree of knowledge man
And bring it back man to the foundation
You understand?
We gon' make it rain on y'all this time
You understand?
And y'all gon' wonder who caused it to happen
Give you 60 minutes of your time baby
And what you gon' get the Remarkable Time baby
You understand?
Yeah, 60 Second Assassin y'all</pre>
