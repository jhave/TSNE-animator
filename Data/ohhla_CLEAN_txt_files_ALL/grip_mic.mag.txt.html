[Kool Keith]
Yo whassup this is Kool Keith, the general speaker in full effect
And I'm out here and.. ridin smooth on this European highway
With this foxy fine mama, by my side, you know that? (Word?)
Right now I'm makin love, but I'ma, say a few rhymes
Check it out, one time for the braincell

Well I'ma grip the mic, grab the mic, hold the mic
Snatch the mic, switch the mic
Freak the mic, sneak the mic, rock the mic
Eat the mic, beat the mic
Pack the mic, freak a style, use a style
Hyper style, Riker's style
Like a style, freak 'em all for a while
Worthwhile, I'm coolin out like I'm Batman
Ridin the Batmobile, holdin my Bat mic
Robbin the Riddler, come on and get in hype
Droppin a bomb - I'm gonna take it over
Fucked up too, that shit was goin smooth

{*beat drops out and starts over*}

Yo whassup this is Kool Keith in full effect
And I'm out here cruisin on this European highway
Doin it my way (uh-huh) check it out
So keep your eye away, and look as I fly away
Check it out

Well I'ma grip the mic, grab the mic, hold the mic
Snatch the mic, switch the mic
Freak the mic, sneak the mic, rock the mic
Eat the mic, beat the mic
Pack the mic, freak a style, use a style
Hyper style, Riker's style
Like a style, freak 'em all for a while
Worthwhile, I'm coolin out like I'm Batman
Ridin the Batmobile, holdin my Bat mic
Robbin the Riddler, come on and get hype
Droppin a rhyme, funky rhymes for the dancefloor
Rhymes flow on, styles come quicker
You've been outfoxed by the metaphor slicker
Think twice, go slow, words'll flow
And speed up rhymes like a pro-
-fessional poet, comin back and you know it
I treat your brain like a whistle, pick it up and I blow it
Four times with rhymes, look and stop for signs
Detour, go back, hit your brakes and stop
You're just a floor that's dirty toy, come battle the Mop
'n'Glow and, stealin the show and
You stay down low'n, while I keep goin
Around the clock, kickin rhymes, the mic is on overtime
Back and front, drunk dizzy here's a sober rhyme
Tellin your braincells that I am the best one
Rappers who perpetrate, come jump up and test one
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down
You and your man, sit down, sit down, Trev tell 'em sit down (sit down)
Rhymes go on and dip so quick by
Stand and wait fool, and yo yo stick by
Stand inside, look around and you'll see me
Join the party, check it out (word)

I'ma take off and cruise and change into third gear
on the Tim Westsood show (Capitol Radio in effect)</pre>
