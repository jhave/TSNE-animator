[Chorus 1] - Lil' Flip (Lil' James)
You on point James (I'm on point Flip)
You act bad James (I act bad Flip)
You got skills (Nigga you know I got skills)
Then lets put our brains together and make some mills

(Lil' James)
I got skills like a coal mine lined up with a drill
Keep the crowd on their feet like Vince Carter wind mills
I'm from the heart of the streets it ain't no harder than me
You better throw in a towel you can't flow harder than me
If ain't sparkin up sweets I'm bowgarding the beat
Then I'm in studios spittin flows dodging the heat
Game is harder to creep mind harder to piece
It's so throwed you gon need tinted goggles to see
It's iced out 
You think you can hang like Wayne its lights out
You think you can hang with Big James you might drop
You think you can grip with Lil' Flip you might ship
So don't slip we knocking tight like vice grip

[Chorus 2] - Lil' James (Lil' Flip)
You on point Flip (I'm on point James)
You act bad Flip (I act bad James)
You got skills (Nigga you know I got skills)
Well lets put our brains together and make some mills

(Lil' Flip)
You know I got skills like Kevin Garnett
In my garage I got  eleven(11) carvettes
I'm Lil' Flip and I'm the freestyle king
And I like to act bad did you peep my ring
And the heat I bring burn like acid
So step back cause I burn through plastic
I'm the hardest down south and niggas hate that
You claim you makin cash but you ain't drop a tape yet
I'm a CEO you know what that mean
Don't nobody touch my green
Some niggas can't rap some niggas can't flow 
But guess what Lil' Flip can do both

[Chorus 2]

[Lil' Flip]
Well I'm a mic wrecker
A lamburgini price checker
Rolex baggetts 30 pointer ice bezel

(Lil' James)
I'm a freestyle ace 
Shining all in your face 
Same gator on my shoes wraped around my waisted

[Lil' Flip]
I'm a track ripper
A black dob hat tipper
I step out at the grammys wearing black slippers

(Lil' James)
I'm a bin bibber
Orange juice and gin sipper
On this track I went first the hook and then Flipper

[Lil' Flip]
I'm a song writer
And I carry my own title
I copyright all of shit 
so nigga don't bite her

(Lil' James)
I'm a fast flower 
True naked ass shower
Endo octomo hydro hash blower

[Lil' Flip]
I'm a big shot
I'm the king of Hip Hop
And when I freestyle I leave you with your lips lock

(Lil' James)
I'm a mud puppy 
Codeine cup guppy
I eat fish shrimp french fries with hush puppys

[Lil' Flip]
I'm in a path finder
I'm autograph signer
And I'm gon be rich until I'm a flat liner

(Lil' James)
I'm a young thug ready
ninthteens(19) on my chevy
Breaking hoes like Eddie 
More blades than Freddie

[Lil' Flip]
Now I'm a superstar
I know you heard of a star
We the ones that be driving them convertable cars

(Lil' James)
I'm a Sunny Side nigga out of Check A Hoe Texas
I stay money wide nigga like a chief executive

[Chorus 1]
