Sizz Shocker

[Silkk]
Son of a oh

[Master P]
You ready whodi; let's go to war

[Chorus x2]
Na Na Na (uh-ha, uh-ha) 
Y'all niggas in trouble now (uh-ha, uh-ha)
Y'all niggas shouldn't have fucked around (uh-uh, uh-uh)
No Limit gone shut this down 

[Silkk]
They got something to fear now
Cause look dude ain't kidding around
No Limit geared down
(They been waiting) but I'm here now
You seen big Four Wheelers but none like these
Many before me dog but none like me
I got a band but dog I'm still a bastard getter
And this time talking about something like a classic hitter
Fuck with niggas who live their whole life in the gutter
I tell you strait uh uh uh uh ain't like I stutter
When the raps go down dog I can rely on the streets
They got to really rap know dog ain't no more relying on beats
Niggas don't wont their girl around me thinking I'm a steal they chick
Insecure niggas don't wont to see their girl on my diss
Try to keep up like VROOOM! when I pass them up
In 4 of them nigga that's what's up
Have them saying money wise ain't nobody fucking with slim
In rap wise Mike how you feel about me: Yo I ain't fucking with him
Y'all in my got to go get it, me I'm ready to spit
I don't think y'all niggas ready for this
But come on

[Chorus x1]

(Music Cuts with explosion)

[Master P]
Don't never count us out
This only the begin Ha-Ha
That's why we winning 
We smarter than y'all and we got to much paper
Remember that whodi</pre>
