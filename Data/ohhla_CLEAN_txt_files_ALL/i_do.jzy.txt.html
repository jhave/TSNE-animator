[Young Jeezy]
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gon of the Bellevee' and 'tron it's too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I'll do anything to leave here tonight with you
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do

[Young Jeezy]
I said now what it is, what it do, homegirl ain't got a clue
If I get you open all the things that I would do to you
Smack it up flip it down, weigh it up, break it down
Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya who's ya daddy
Ain't even gotta open your eyes, know what your looking at
And I ain't even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact
Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact
Lest she my ride or die, it's us against the world
You know we both hustlin' so hustlin' is our world
Said I musta had too much to drink I'm in my G-Mode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause it's the G-Code
Promise if I get locked, you'll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me, you'll remain loyal
And errytime you give it to me it's gon be the bomb
And in these unlucky streets you're gon' be my lucky charm

[Chorus]

(Man, that boy so cold, give him a blanket in here)

[Jay-Z]
I D-O, I D-O, I D-O oh oh oh
I be though, promise to treat this game, I D O
Under the cold, not bring drama to mama's peephole
Life's a bitch but she's the only love that I know - oh oh
So la-a-dee, after the "I Do's" lets do Mercedes
Lets tie the knot, lets grab us a pot, lets make a baby
Looking back, I don't know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me
I Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And til the task force grow
To hug her every corner til I get ash from the cold
Or until I've amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold
Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever, ever
Your secret's I treasure, for better or worser
You'll always be my first love til death do us part
Pull a hearse up, my verse up

[Chorus]

[Andre 3000]
Nothings more attractive than a heavy praying woman
To a him and those and them been defecating on me (ughh)
Her would sense the heaven, and him when Andre omen
Baby I'm hell, save me, don't bail
Crazy I tell you all of this in the middle of a club
Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like like love
And friend and rockstar and so and so's a genius
So him vow to never utter him do unless he mean it
Her proud like her mother and ooohh momma's sweet
So you just know that Juicy fruit ain't gon' fall too far from tree
So if we ever woop the woop
I want all that bleep to bleep
On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee
Say I do I do I do I do I do
So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
Lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil' cocoon
And maybe 2030 our baby, she'll be nerdy make the whole club swoon

[Chorus]</pre>
