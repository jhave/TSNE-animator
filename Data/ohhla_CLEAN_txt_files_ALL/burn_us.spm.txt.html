[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
Wizard Of O-Z, at the age of fourteen
In the Orleans, I met my first dope fiend
A rock and roll king
But this was no dream
Made so much cash, they call me "Mean Joe" Greene
On the protein, caught a case and rode clean
Money to be made when my cellphone ring
Sip codeine, hoes say I'm so mean
When my niggas freestylin' 'bout the same old thing
Cause I'm servin' the white
And smokin' the green
All the real motherfuckers sure know what I mean
A cut from my G's, it means nothing to me
To turn my bitch out and let 'em fuck her for free
Cause I know you
And you know me
I got niggas that'll front me two whole keys
True homies
That learn to survive
Lord knows that these streets tryin' to burn us alive

Hook: South Park Mexican
Lord knows that these streets tryin' to burn us alive
Lord knows that these streets tryin' to burn us alive
Lord knows that these streets tryin' to burn us alive
Lord knows that these streets tryin' to burn us alive

[Verse 2: Happy Perez {Happy Perez &amp; South Park Mexican}]
I remember way back, way back in the day, day
Used to be broke
Now this rap shit pays me
Ugh
Me and Los had a million dollar scheme (What)
Platinum
At the age of seventeen
But that ain't shit (Nigga)
And I don't, give a fuck
Used to roll around in a beat-up pickup truck
Used to sit back, blow a swish everyday {*inhale*}
While most my nigga's dramas still stuck in the deep game
Hustlin' all night
Keeping your money tight
Look
We blow this up and everything gon' be alright
Mayne
Kiss my baby, make the game my wife
Don't make me cock my shit
And put
One in your life
Tryin' to take this
Because you hate this (Bitch)
You don't know what I went through, just to make this (Bitch)
And man, believe me homie
Nigga, I'm a survive
Cause {Lord knows that these streets tryin' to burn us alive}

Repeat Hook

[Verse 3: Grimm {Grimm &amp; South Park Mexican}]
Now is you in
Or out
Can't be caught in between
So quick decision, which position is you thinking on being
See, we ain't this
Or that, can't be something you claim
You put in all in one thing and be as proud as your name
The game of do's
And don't's, make sure you know which is which
Friends and family get your love, treat a hoe like a bitch
It's the ups
And downs of the lives that we live
Some niggas fucking around, some with their wife and their kid
A lot of give
And take
Nobody said that it'd be easy
Cheddar ain't always cheesy, the wind ain't always breezy
Believe me from here
To there and back
It's all the same like making 'caine, turn to crack for stacks
And black jack to craps, every bay is covered
Been breakin' bread with my brothers, but can't forget my mother
She told me live
And die by everything you try
And {Lord knows that these streets tryin' to burn us alive}

Lord knows that these streets tryin' to burn us alive
