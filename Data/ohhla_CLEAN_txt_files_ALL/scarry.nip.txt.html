I have one question for the whole wide world. 
Is, do yaw like scary movies?
It seems to me yaw do.
Freddy and them, I'm jealous of them nigguz man. 
Know what I'm sayin? For real.

Guns cocked, a nigga dropped shot in his head
It don't stop til his body rocked shot in his leg
Hold him down on the ground
Then we all take turns
And you would think we were squishing on worms
I'm on that dip nigga nip nigga gotta an AK
Watch me hypnotize the earth make em do what I say
And make the good people rich
And the others don't bother
Make the evil start killin up there mothers and fathers
And fuck America, now the psych is steppin on toes
Bill Clinton got at least twenty-seven more hoes (yaw don't believe me)
Short ?? take a life, an eye for a brain
While cats in the mortuary seem untamed
Kinda scary, Sleepin by them graveyard bones
Its just the way they just sit in the tombstone
Crooked cops the brutality would stop
If we all came to gather and just did like Pac, and bust

Do you like scary movies (yes) 4X

And I'm the psychopath ready for war
And I'ma let the nigga go if his keys in the car
Everyday mind state I call it psych mentality
Set it straight, Norman Bates is the psycho reality
Casualty, nigga thirsty for blood
Two pit bulls locked up, one just bled like a flood
Break 'em up let 'em go again give him respect
I saw 'em LOCKED in the same spot twitching his neck
My bad attitude I'm not in the mood
Searchin, for a body so the birds can have food
nigga, drag him down the street
Til his ass says please
Concrete hurtin when its scraped to the knees
Do You Like Scary Movies
I'm switchin to psycho
The darkside... Freddy, Jason, Michael, and chuckie
Candy man, Leather Face young g
These killas will never die cause they live throw me (nigga)

Hook 4X

I see brains hangin, it went throw a phase
Some of yaw take notes
while some of yaw graze
The rest of yaw muthafuckas just form one line
Psycho club showin love and you can have some of mine
Don't try to play me at my show or think I'ma ho
Don't make reenact movies at my muthfuckin show
And start bustin like a psychopath, reloadin clips
Newspaper read 22 slaughtered by NIP
The psycho in side of me conceals itself
But the moment that there's drama it reveals itself
A new man understand with a whole new plan
D-E-A-T-H my man
The sound of a body part popped like a pistol
And most chain saws cut straight to the gristle
Keep dancin, movin, the beat sounds groovy
Don't trip muthfucka you done seem a horror movie

Hook 4X

Hell yea
Hell yea we love 'em 4X</pre>
