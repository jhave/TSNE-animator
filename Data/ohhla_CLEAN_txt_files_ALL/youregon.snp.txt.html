[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Let me take you to the land of wonder, we can wander
undercover, secret lovers, ay heyyy ("And ohh you're gonna love me")
("You're gonna wanna hug me, and") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me

[Snoop Dogg]
Hmm, and I ain't never felt like this
I ain't never met a girl with the right mix
Green eyes, light-skinned with some nice tits
It took a minute just to write this
I'm the Boss Dogg baby~! I'ma die rich
So let the money talk for me, fuck the nonsense
Hold me down, be my ride or die bitch
We fuck then we fight, we fight then we fuck
I'ma beat it up tonight like Kimbo Slice
Come live the proper life, no I ain't the shoppin type
I might take you out to eat, we can grab a bite
Now let me grab my bike and roll yo' ass through Crescent Heights
Up in Hollywood, step into the limelight
and hit this bubble kush, let me get your mind right
This is "Wonderland," let your mind take flight
We gotta hurry up, I'm only here for one night

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
This next girl Bird, she from the suburbs
and live by herself, like cars and nice furs
and loves hip-hop - The Neptunes and Murs
But I'm her favorite rapper, my biggest fan is her
I like her skin tone, and how her figure curves
We smoke mad kush and drink until our vision blur
And then I pat her down, like she gettin searched
I fuck her with my chain on, she pulls on my shirt
like nigga don't stop, until the pussy squirt
I hit it twice and bone out, she went back to work
This happens all the time, I gotta go rehearse
for my next show, I tour on May 1st
Get yo' mind right, and this may work
You know love is pain, and havin faith hurts
You rollin with the best, so grab your heels and purse
and welcome to "Wonderland" the best place on Earth
Uhh, you gon' love me!

("And ohh you're gonna love me")
("You're gonna wanna hug me, and") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me

[Chorus] - 1/2</pre>
