[Verse 1]
I'm a Grady baby, ATL
And all my life the A been so crunk as hell
You don't wanna step too close or go too far
Cause where I'm from, shawdy, niggaz a beat you down wit they car
Fila, Prada, from my head to my feet
Niggaz on the block with the rock they don't sleep
Man, South Dekalb Mall be the crunkest shit
Or you can roll through Buckhead and go fall on a bitch
I'm a giant ass playa, I'll stomp on a hater
I'ma pop this shit off from Zone 3 to Decatur
We can gon' back down to where my grandma stay
Depending on the area you better watch what you say
And I don't care if you over there lookin all crazy
When I get locked up man them broads they wanna save me
This the home of the ass wit the biscuits in it
And the Janes on the street charge mo' than a penny, A!

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
When it's grind time let my A shine
When Im bustin rhymes, smokin pounds
My blood seepin wit Georgia Wine
And niggaz don't love the A like I love the A
I just love the way the A smell everyday
A town to yo' town yeah this how it go
Smokin dro' fuckin' hoes on the city road
When I stomp that bastard I left him with a bruise
Got Fila on my feet so it had to be a shoe
I live for the A, I die for the A
I ride for the A, so fuck what you say
What you know about I-20 to 285
Got a fine atlanta bitch givin head in the ride
G's up, get yo cheese up, in the classroom crunk
Got bidness 'bout my shit, so I stay super drunk
Ridin' downtown with a shot of tequila
Jon introduced me to the game, I'm hot like reefer
A!

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3]
Carry the A on my back like a torture rack
I'ma represent it if you scared to go handle that
Drankin' on crunk, reminiscin' on crunk years
It's the city of crunk where I shed my tears
Throwin the peace sign up then upside down
A-town off the rip hell yeah I'm proud
Get crunk all day we don't sleep at night
And if you fight one shawdy then we all gon' fight
Don't nobody get crunk in the club like us
And if security trippin on pimpin we all gon' rush
Even though other niggaz think they hard
Ain't nan harder than Stone Mountain, I swear to God
Yeah y'all love our hoes, you love our gold
Martin Luther King from the A, so I love my home
Westside to Scottdale we all cut hammers
You can catch kids skippin in Underground Atlanta
Yeah

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
