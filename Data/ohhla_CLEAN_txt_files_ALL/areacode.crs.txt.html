Chorus: Nate Dogg

I've got hoes (I've got hoes)
In different area codes (area) area codes (codes)
Hoes (hoes...hoes) in different area codes (area) area codes (codes)

[Ludacris]
Now you thought I was just 7-7-0, and 4-0-4?
I'm worldwide, biiitch act like y'all know
It's the abominabol-hoe man
Globe-trot international post man
Neighbor-dick dope man
7-1-8's, 2-0-2's
I send small cities and states I-O-U's
9-0-1, matter fact 3-0-5
I'll jump off the G4, we can meet outside
So control your hormones and keep your drawers on
'Til I close the door and I'm jumping your bones
3-1-2's, 3-1-3's (oh), 2-1-5's, 8-0-tree's (oh)
Read your horoscope and eat some horderves
Ten on pump one, these hoes is self serve
7-5-7, 4-1-0's, my cell phone just overloads

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Now everyday is a hoe-ly day, so stop the violence
and put the 4-4 away, skeet shoot a hoe today
5-0-4, 9-7-2's
7-1-tree, whatcha gon' do?
You checkin' out the scene, I'm checkin' a hoe tonight
With perpendicular, vehicular homicide
3-1-4, 2-0-1 (hey)
Too much green, too much fun (hey)
I bang cock in Bangkok
Can't stop, I turn and hit the same spot
Think not, I'm the thriller in Manilla
Schlong in Hong Kong
Pimp 'em like Bishop, Magic, Don Juan
Man after Henny with a coke and a smile
I just pick up the motherfuckin' phone and dial
I got my condoms in a big ass sack
I'm slangin' this dick like a New Jack (biatch)

[Nate Dogg]
Is it cuz they like my gangsta walk? (gangsta walk)
Is it cuz they like my gangsta talk? (gangsta talk..ohh)
Is it cuz they like my handsome face? (handsome face)
Is it cuz they like my gangsta ways? (gangsta ways..ohh)
Whatever it is, they love it
And they just won't let me be
I handles my biz, don't rush me (area)
Just relax and let me be free (codes)
Whenever I call (I call), come runnin'
2-1-2 or 2-1-3
You know that I ball (I ball), stop frontin'
or I'll call my substitute freak (hoes)

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Uh, 9-1-6, 4-1-5, 7-0-4
Shout out to the 2-0-6
Everybody in the 8-0-8
Ha-ah, 2-1-6, 7-0-2, 4-1-4
3-1-7, 2-1-4's and the 2-8-1's
3-3-4, 2-0-5, I see ya
Uh-uh, 3-1-8, 6-0-1's, 2-0-tree
8-0-4, 4-0-2, 3-0-1
9-0-4, 4-0-7, 8-5-0
7-0-8, 5-0-2
Hoes in different area codes, know that
Southern Hoes-pitality, Northern Exhoes-ure
Ha-ha, hoe ridin' on the West coast
Ya understand what I'm sayin'?
Uh-uh, hoe-cus pocus, you the dopest
Uh, hoes to the right, hoes to the left, five hoes this time
WHOO! HOE-NO! (*laughing*)
The Hip-hop hoeoller-coster, that's what we on right now
Ha-ha, no need to get all hoes-tile
YEEEEAAAAHHHH! WHOO!
Def Jam South baby, Disturbing Tha Peace
Dazaphy-zy, Uncle Face
Ludacris, uh, hoes...(*whistling*) I'm sweatin' like a motherf...
