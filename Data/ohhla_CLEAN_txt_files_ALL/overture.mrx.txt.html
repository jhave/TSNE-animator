Verse 1

I arose in mist,by an obelisk, emerge a glowing disc
Many are called but few are chosen to expose the gift
I blow the piff, strategize on how to co exist
With hopelessness thoughts provoking kids with open wrist
Unload the fifth, avoid the callous voice of malice
Destroy the palace,your drinking from a poisoned chalice
Deploy chariots, june brought the food for thought
Subdue your fort with brutal force,marx the cruel sort
And through the path of life,pursue the parasite
With Gruesome apetite consume a human sacrifice
Disaster strikes, like the paragon forces,
They travel on horses ride through babylon fortress
came to inherit,claim a message
Plus they brought the frame of the relic,your name on the death wish
From pain you will perish, finish foe with wicked flow
The hidden scroll turn your inner soul bitter cold

Hook:

And they watch us from a distance
24/7 like they clocking our existance
I plot for the resitance can't stop the mission
I speak from the heart disregard the opposition

Verse 2

I look at life through disturbed lens
Contemplating how the world ends
Prophets waiting for the hurricanes and whirldwinds
I burn a stem, inner peace I can't find
Middle eastern landmine wicked beast of mankind
So I recline, they unworthy of attention
losing early worshipping earthly possesion
Learn the lesson,america loves the devil
On june 4th,and so was born another rebel
Seek him out,his thoughts what he speaking bout
He without faith is lost in a sea of doubt
And I remain calm,while they claim hardest
More trees than the amazon rainforest
Trained forces,snakes will reign lawless
Regardless obama or mccain in the office
They all the same, just a different colored puppet
Corrupt the budget, and gain the trust of the public</pre>
