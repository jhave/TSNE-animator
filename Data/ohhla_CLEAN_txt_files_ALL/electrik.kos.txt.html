[Intro]
Ok, its about to go down
Please step up
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go

[Verse 1]
Its the return, burn like a supernova
Spit the plates, the great debates over
Dont rush, take it easy, slow down
Earth is a space ship spinning round and round
Were in it, together, we can make it better
Don't sweat a, thing swing with no vendetta
I rhyme in a graph style, carve every letter
To move every B-boy king like Coretta
Scott, keep it hot block once rock
The plot that we tried to recignise was not
The L to the O-V, M-O-V-E
K dub dropin' the dub, thats new TV
The E-M-C double E no doubt
Runin' the route, wakin' out, turnin' the part out
We all fall from grace and make mistakes
And race the pace the base with the anidote "base"
And every single word in the verb wildstyle
Its not a mission its a riddle lifestyle
I'm still in the struggle and I see the light guile
Turnin' pretend accend whats in the profile

[Chorus]
Can you feel it, to the beat ya'll
Let the music play for the people
And if got a rock, whether your ready or not
yo, guess whos back with the sequell
Oh ya, just do it
Oh ya, just do it

[Verse 2]
Now, in the beginning the light shined so bright
Within the city of my mind-scaped night
Listening, glistening the moon refliceting the sun
making me one with the music
Oh, get low, get for, get ho
Its different black gold
Yes I'm in the house but I never ever sold
Rhyme like vynl, 20 years old
With the mic in my hand, ringin' alarm
Singin' the song, bringing the calm to dramas so hard
To much info, been so instrumental, prtential, exponential
My DJ's cuts are presidential
Yo Jazz, let the rythm hit 'em
I woke up to make the main cut, to face the pain
What does space contain love?
Its the heat-seaker, packin' the speaker to beat the sleek creature
It was written the sequel

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Now
The world is yours unless the world is ours
What casting stones from afar
We're like people driving in our cars
On los highway, my way</pre>
