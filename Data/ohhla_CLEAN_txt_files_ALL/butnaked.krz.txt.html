Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ooh
Strip down for Kali baby
Ooh
Set it up for Kali baby

[Verse 1]
She act like she don't like me
Said my type is not likely
So get close to her slightly
Ooh
Jeans fitted so tightly
She must have known my name is Kali baby
And I be the one that's drivin' all them girlies crazy (big boy)
I'll be your captain
We'll get it crackin'
Call me if you're ready for action

[Chorus]
Butt naked fun (fun, girl get ready for the)
Butt naked fun (she keep givin' me love)
Butt naked fun (I'm a give it to)
Butt naked fun (oh yeah)
Butt naked fun (she keep givin me love)
Butt naked fun (I hope you're ready for the)
Butt naked fun (she givin' it up)
Butt naked fun (it's automatic)

[Verse 2]
We start on the floor (work our way to the bed)
And I can give you more (if ya do what I say)
Stop it (stop it)
You doin' it on purpose (carpet)
If we dunk it up it might burn out
Do you got a sweet tooth (let me unwrap it)
I see what I want, let me grab it
Can I be your candy boy
Strip down right where you are (and get ready for love)

[Chorus]
Butt naked fun (let me get it)
Butt naked fun (can I touch ya)
Butt naked fun (she givin' it up)
Butt naked fun (can I get that)
Butt naked fun (I'm a give it to)
Butt naked fun (girl get ready for the)
Butt naked fun (she keep givin' me love)
Butt naked fun (it's automatic)

[Verse 3]
Ooh
Let me in the middle
Ooh
I just want a little
Ooh
Baby let me middle
Ooh
Girl you're so ghetto

[Chorus]
Butt naked fun (it feels like)
Butt naked fun (I'm a give it to)
Butt naked fun (get the baby oil)
Butt naked fun (and take your socks off)
Butt naked fun (I'm a give it to)
Butt naked fun (strip down for love)
She keep givin' me love
Butt naked fun (it's automatic)</pre>
