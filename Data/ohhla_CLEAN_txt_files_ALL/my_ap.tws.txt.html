Come on we can go on over you know to my place
You know to the Pendergrass style
You know come and go with me
It won't be long just for a little while
Right well check it out

(Turtle Banxx)
What's up with you miss?
Your lovely lips got me fiending for one kiss
I'm having fits just to be close to you
Give me once chance I'll make the most of you
What lovers supposed to do
Henny on ice a toast to you
I know how ya approaching, scheming on them noticeable thighs
and that innocent look in ya eyes
I know ya tired of them crooked guys
You know the type cheating just to get the prize on one night
and when the sunlight hits ya sexy alters
Mr. Heartless is in the darkness quicker than a loaded cartridge
I know you feel like a target (look here)
Don't bury your head like an ostrich (hey)
He gonna get his regardless, meanwhile lets hit the market (yeah)
Sitting hot dinner on the carpet
I feed you strawberries and chocolate in my apartment

[Chorus - Turtle Banxx, Johnny P]
[T] In my apartment, slip into your sexy garment
Candle lights and music set the tone now convince me darling
[P] Is it alright if I lay you down what what
If it's ok we can play in my apartment
Is it alright if I lay you down what what
If it's ok we can play in my apartment ut ohhhh

(Turtle Banxx)
I know you skeptical on dating based on your past relations
but I got patience plus I'm waiting on the right occasion
I'm yours for the taken ain't no mistaking this
Alone to see ya face and be bracing with every kiss
I'm hating the time we missed the fellas don't understand
It don't matter them are boys and I'm a man
Your boyfriend Buddy you calling him husband
When you not looking he trying to holla at ya cousin (thought he wasn't)
Play like it ain't nothing cant disguise the hurt in your eyes
Late nights I hear your cries for loving

(Johnny P) Come on baby

[Chorus - Turtle Banxx, Johnny P]
[T] In my apartment, slip into your sexy garment
Candle lights and music set the tone now convince me darling
[P] Now is it alright if I lay you down what what
Cause if it's ok we can play in my apartment
Is it alright if I lay you down what what
Cause if it's ok we can play in my apartment

(Turtle Banxx)
Street hustling now became thangs of the past
Money at last again help me baby channel this anger
Ready to blast at oppositions
They don't give me the chamber
I talk the strangest cause my homies only want paper
Don't get me wrong I won't put you in danger the nature of the streets
Ready to claim another life asking God to save us forgiven hearts
The tamers the youth is hard to train em
They only want money and cars status and stars living ghetto famous
Ain't this the shamest lets resolve the changes so they won't be namest
Broke starving and banging
like that old saying home is where the heart is gods will gods will

[Chorus - Turtle Banxx, Johnny P]
[T] In my apartment, slip into your sexy garment
Candle lights and music set the tone now convince me darling
[P] Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Is it alright if I lay you down
on my waterbed while we smoke this pound
Got ya feeling buzzed off the Hennesey
Tell ya girl that you wanna ride with me
Meet me out front in my six fo' fo'
I spit a little game now I got you home
And when ya man ask where you've been
been with me in my apartment

Baby I want to play.. let's go all the way

(Johnny P)
In my apartment in my apartment
Mmmmm let's get it started girl

I really want to play.. take me away

In my apartment in my apartment
Mmmmm let's get it started girl

Yeah</pre>
