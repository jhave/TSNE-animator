[Chorus]
Ayo wait a minute
(Yo that's that shit!)
Ayo turn it up
(Yo that's that shit!)
Yo could you fix the station?
(Yo that's that shit!)
Yo watch him fuck it up
(Yo that's that shit!)

[Verse One]
Awww shit, I got your head bobbin'
Ain't no stoppin' cause the shit that I'm poppin'
Is from the heart so you know that I'm real
So you can relax cause I'm signed and sealed
Know a lot of faces in this rap shit
Always got a buck cause I don't make wack shit
Yeah, yeah, you either like it or you don't
The sounds all natural
And in fact you will
Stand in awe and watch a brother catch wreck
My credit is good and I never bounced a check
But if my funds run low and my shit get's critical
It's off to the chemical
Got to give a shout to the Large Professor
Thought I lost his number but I left it on my dresser
On and on and on like the Mississippi
Not on a gangster tip
Ayo I'm not a hippie
I'm just an ordinary (nary)
Brother who is very (very)
Dedicated to real rap so don't compare me to another brother
Cause I'm the type that'll smother
A wack MC, his DJ or any other
Member of your crew, not a thing you can do
Gotta say peace to Infinite Kendu
Showbiz, Fat Joe, ? and Apache
Nobody can match me, and yo you couldn't catch me
In a new pair of British with the thick rubber sole
But I won't flinch, cause I got soul
And I bring joy just like Anita Baker
If the girl doesn't like to smile you need to take her
To a Diamond D show, cause I bring joy
To men, women, girls, boys
Jews, Gentiles, Catholics, Protestants 
Step to Diamond D it'll be your abolishment
I'm givin' hand shacks for you and your man's sake
Cause I write rhymes so much that my hand's ache
It's '92 so what you gonna do?
Barbecue or buggalo?
Yeah

[Chorus]
Ayo wait a minute
(Yo that's that shit!)
Yo could turn it up
(Yo that's that shit!)
Ayo fix the station?
(Yo that's that shit!)
Yo watch him fuck it up
(Yo that's that shit!)

[Verse Two]
Damn I can't, damn I can't
Damn I can't wait to make my next LP
Exhume new lyrics, become more wealthy
I'll never play myself cause I don't play games
Know a lot of peeps but I say no names
And my man Show with ?
We hunt down beats just like my Uncle Wally
Search for blood on the late night flick
Labels used to front but now they on the [echos]
So listen to the rhythm, the vibe is true
Cause like Quaker Oat's it's the right thing to do
I go on and on to the kick drum
I got oodles and oodles so yo come get some
I won't sweat it, cause now my respect's known
While you're home, suckin' on a neck bone
Tell the girls that you're livin' fat
But that you're only eatin' chicken backs
Yo I'm kickin' facts
So don't front pal, just fine tunin'
Peace to the J.B.'s and The Flavor Unit
Pete Rock &amp; C.L.
I stay on the D.L.
You'll never see Diamond snackin' on J.E.L.
L.O., oh hell no
So make like Lloyd Lindsey Young and say hello
People underestimate even though the best they make
Sounds like a big pile of shhh (sounds like a big pile of)
But I'm not the type to go out like a dimple
A brother like D makes hits
Peace

[Outro]
Yeah, goin' out to Forrest Projects
And my man Fly La at the Co-Op City
Yeah and I'm out like a trout</pre>
