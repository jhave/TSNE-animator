So baby take it off take it off (Baby you got it)
Your body make me pull off the trigger, Redman

[Redman]
Here comes the stick up, pick up pick up
Comin' from Jersey my brain was spliffed up
Before that cha' picked up
The Funkadelic 2-01 super pandama
Is there another (NO!)
I make condoms run for cover
Hey yo, who wanna have an orgy y'all
Let's see y'all
I slap so many punans you would think I'm made of bee-ba
Stop if ya guard extra-large
Better keep my guns tight
For my jimi in case my bullets have to take flight
I'm cooler than gang
When I rock hits, kick raps in vain
Place boxed up so keep ya glocks up
Ya damn skippy, I rap on Jodeci tracks
Their records platinum, so next year my records sell like that then

[Jo-Jo]
I don't wanna be rude babe, but you really turn me on
I don't wanna be cool baby, as if I told ya what I want
They way you groove is so fly, and I won't front
If yout take off your clothes babe that's really all I want
Let me see it

[Chorus: Jodeci x2]
Give it up, give it up you got it
Show we what you got, you got it
Give it up, give it up you got it
Take it off, take it off you got it

[K-Ci]
Got more than what it take baby to make a N-I-double G-A drop
So when you wanna take it off, please girl don't you stop
36-24, your waist like a hydraulic car
When ya wanna drop it girl, we can go very far, ooh

[Chorus: Exteneded with K-Ci ad-libs]

[DeVante]
Keep it goin' baby, like that like that
Keep it goin', like that
Keep it goin' baby, like that like that
Keep it goin', like that
Keep it goin' baby, like that like that
Keep it goin', like that
The rap Funkadelic, yo Redman

[Redman]
When I tear the frame out, I feel OK now
My style is way out, spaced out
Ya wanna taste now, because my name out
Who's the Funkadelic
Hey yo, G it's me smell it, inhale it
And drop ya draws for the cause if ya felt it
Now do you feel good honey dip then drop ya draws quick
I see you, there's that tatoo I G'd you
A small world, I fucked a bunch a black, fat and tall girls
Smoke a Marlboro when shack tales like Erick Bell
Now pardon my French I ain't with that bull they pulled on Tyson
I got my ghetto license and I'm drivin'
The homies dive in when the girl take off her size tens
Whoomp there it is, that's what I mean with the tag team
Then jest like 95 South when ya look out
And then maybe next year maybe I show her that ya played out
Redman from the 94' from the hood drop
Got mad skills that cop feels
Plus my crew still good

[Chorus repeated to fade; with Jodeci ad-libs]</pre>
