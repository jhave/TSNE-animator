Yea, Turn it up in the head phones
Ya Know....like that shit sound like rock music
You know what im talkin bout (Uh Uh)
Yea, My man Bruno just stepped in You know how we living it up
We all gettin money (ha) thats what he like to say
Fuck It....Its My Life Nigga

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
This is a dream of a hustler (like a nightmare!)
I had the butter and the fiends was in love with us (that Fishscale!)
We copped the gutta, not a team that could fuck with us! (Dipset!)
And word to mother keep the thing in every truck with us
Now I was fronting like Rich was, and some of my bit-ches
Was going so hard, got some of us sick thugs (SNAGZ!)
And minor setbacks got some of us tripped up but
The guns we done gripped up so we coming to get ya!
And fuck the local authorities (fuck em!)
and hope the big boys don't pick up my case (pray for me)
Cause for these big toys and these chips, we get chased! (balling!)
Playing ball just like the Orioles to get to 1st base (Ya Hear Me!!!)
But the....goons on 2nd, bust on 3rd (WATCH IT!)
You know they....move with the weapons, get bucks off birds (iT'S CRAZY OUT HERE!)
It's like I'm playing Chicken with my life
Tryna get this paper moving pitches for a price

[Hook: Max B]
WE COME TO RIDE OUT WITH THEM NIGGAS BABY WE GETTING FIGURES
IT'S BYRD GANG......WE DOING IT BIIIIIG
BUT WE TOWERED UP, GET THE REMY I'LL GET A CUP.....YOU SLIPPIN GOOD, CAN I GET A SQUEEEEEZE
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT IT WITH THEM NIGGAS
CAUSE THEM HAMMERS THEY WONT HESISTATE TO SQUEEZE
WE ON THE ROAD, TRAVEL CROSS THE GLOBE.....ALL MY HOMIES UP WITH THIS GETTING CHEEEEEESE

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Look....the nightmares of a trap star (SCAAARY!)
With white tees, Nike air's and my fast car (FLOSSIN!)
D.A tryna wrap me in the charge (Uptown)
But I just bought some V's and a pack in my garage (Ballinnn!)
Now....me rapping what's the odds? (whats the odds?)
We the last crew standing....DIPLOMATS NOW IN CHARGE! (Byrd Gang)
Now.....$300 for the light show (WOOOWWW!)
Another hundred on the hand to watch the ice glow (DAMN!)
Another 10 grand to watch the dice roll
Trying to let you motherfuckers see this how my life go (THIS IS REAL SHIT!)
The bright lights and this big city (WOWWW)
I'ma live the nightlife until the pigs get me (Come n get meee!!)
Range Rove'ing, Big Truck Series (YEAHH)
The chain frozen, big chunk jewelry (STUNTIN)
White girls say he's all semi cool (What else?)
But you don't want to cost him cause he got a short fuse

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
We live life on reality (TRUE SHIT)
And we flip white for a salary (GETTIN MONEY)
You might catch us at the light in the lavish V (BALLINNN)
But watch them "Blue &amp; Whites" try and grab a G (SQUALLYYY)
Making some chips so the hate's getting thick (I FEEL IT!)
Watch the world through my tint, smoking haze in the whip (THAT PURRRRPLEEE!)
Contemplate, maybe take a little trip (Vactionnn!)
Ocean Drive heavy glean in my necklace (WOWW)
Call up cabs, rushing drinks out of "Wet Willies" (DAMMNN)
"Eu Seuy O Balling" but y'all foolish
Getting locked up for crimes and ya lawyer's ain't Jewish! (STUUUUUUUUUPID!)
That's why I keep the Turnie's on the tainer (thats right)
Cause everytime I turn I'm getting chained up (gettin chained up...THATS THE PROBLEM)
They say what they want to search, tryna tame us (FUCK EM)
I think they mad we from the turf and we dangerous
AND MY WHOLE CREW ICEY WE PLAYING HOCKEY LIKE THE RANGERS
