Black Jack
Was a fighting man
Black Jack
Was a mighty man

You stand them up
He knock them out

Yeah Yeah
Thats the real

You set them up
He knock them down

Yeah Yeah
Thats the deal

Now sing them high
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY
Up in the sky
Whoa, Oh, Whoa, Whoo

Break it down low
Whoa, Whoa
Break it off slow
Whoa, Whoa

Then shout it out
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Hey, Hey

Who dat boogie man
There dat boogie man
Tackidy Tackidy Tap Tap Tap
Holdin' bread in hand
Go head work that band
Go head work it say
Talkin' the talk and walkin' the walk
Is what daddy do they say
Wear those pretty clothes
Drive them pretty cars
You a super hero
You a super star
You a super man
Go head fly yo cape
Blowin' in the wind
Let it touch the hand
Stand and fight and win
Snatch the crown again
Wit' yo mighty swing
And yo flashy smile
Let them see the light
You so black and bright
You so bright you black
Shinin' you cryin' to fight them back

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah (repeats)</pre>
