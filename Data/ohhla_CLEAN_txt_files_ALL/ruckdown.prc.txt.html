[Intro]
This, is Kimbo Price
He is a fighter, who as you can see from the blood on his knuckles
Has no problem taking apart people's faces

[Chorus]
Tell Dru that Ruck is runnin the label now
Tell Buck that Ruck is runnin the label now
Tell Shuckey that Ruck is runnin the label now
Noah already know, Ruck is runnin the label now

[Sean Price: repeat 2X]
I don't care who hot, I don't care who drop
It's my time nigga I'ma do what it do, ock~!
Crackin my tube socks, stackin my shoebox
Money makin mistress, Saab shoes is too hot

[Sean Price - right after 2X]
Listen to Tupac, thinkin you thugged out
{*scratched to incomprehensibility*}
Niggaz is bugged out, off too many dust joints
Get the shit on point, Ruck is like fuck points
Earth Wind &amp; Fire out your face but the God smack him
Eight spit, facelift nigga when Sean rappin
Niggaz hope Sean pop, niggaz know Sean flop
Johnny Rambo shit, inf' beam with the long stock
I told these motherfuckers I ain't, playin around this time
I came back for the, money and crown this time
Listen, fuck up your stomach, the gun to your navel
Tell Dru and Buck that Ruckus is runnin the label, BAM

[Chorus]
Tell Dru that Ruck is runnin the label now
Tell Buck that Ruck is runnin the label now
Tell Shuckey that Ruck is runnin the label now
Noah already know, Ruck is runnin the label now
Tell Steele that Ruck is runnin the label now
Tell Tek that Ruck is runnin the label now
Tell Rock that Ruck is runnin the label now
Ruste already know, Ruck is runnin the label now - P!

[Kimbo Slice]
So you know, we can always do that bare knuckle style
Y'knahmsayin? We can always take it back to old school
That'll work for me, y'knahmsayin?
It's whatever with me man
But if you keep on rappin man, I'ma have to zip you closed baby
Cause I'm gettin tired of the talk, knahmsayin?
So the next one that have somethin to say
just see me indirectly man
I'll come to yo' camp, knahmsayin?
And that's real talk man
Holla at'cha boy, I ain't goin nowhere... (P!)</pre>
