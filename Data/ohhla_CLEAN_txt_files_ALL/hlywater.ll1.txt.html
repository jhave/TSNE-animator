alias Khrist *du...zoom continues in background* 
[Lord Have Mercy] All my, all my people, all my heads go zoom

[Khrist]

I'm hungry for this rap thing so step into my way, you get pushed
By my inner wind forces like Tae Chai
Huh, oh Lord Have Mercy
Your crucifiction hurts me, a lyrical artitst
Who paints his pictures in the darkness; I spark this
You better believe, Khrist in nice
Kill devils with Holy Water, emcees I slaughter just to thought
Surival's a sport
And your idols 
Enable you strenghth to see quotes from the bible
They're psychotic, half man and half demon
Been around the world 666 years and still fiendin
And I have the name Khrist 
Because I was chosen to give strength
No fictitious, delicious sweets for the enemy, since you own
And when the light turns dawn, its on

Chorus

du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du, zoom, du-du-du-du-du-du-du, zoom *2X*

[Lord Have Mercy]

To understand, what, that I'm a man of my word?
You'll see the rebirth
I take ammendments on Earth
Feel free, to challenge God as mortal men
Collapse your sunshine, bring mudslides, and swords to your hands
So (A-men)  Let no man control me 
(A-men) The God ghetto holy
(A-men) Like crooked police that stole keys
And rock, nose bleeds, illegal toast feed
The roots of all evil, like fertilized hope seed
Roll deep, your flock (know me)
Yo, twist these, pier stretched blocks
For distance spots
For shifty (ha) Niggaz with the cobra fangs
I spit the, golden slang, that fold and bang
Your frame will leave you, fooled for days
Feeling, old and gray
Now watch the vultures that swallow overdoses of the rum over pain
I'm ever known as soldier pain, the host that that hang, close at range
cause nowadays we choke and maim
The sneaky ones, that great these ones with they arms open
Like, dopeheads that show they veins, now stole remains
The hall of fame, and know these names
At the phrohecies 
That hold the lock and key
Ha! now lets get (deep with this, deep with this)
How sweet it is that Scarface's bring starvation of sinners till I see they
ribs
(Evil men, evil men)
Bite the hand that's (feeding them, feeding them)
(Hah) My breezing is intoxicating like Seagrum's Gin
Over proof
Ha,  my heart stay cold and loose
Mold your youth, while I hold your troops for ransom
Call a truce before Samson, body-slam sons and send the troops home

Chorus:

Everybody say zoom, du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du zoom, du-du-du-du-du zoom. 
All my heads go zoom, du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du zoom, du-du-du-du-du zoom.
Everybody go zoom, du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du zoom, du-du-du-du-du zoom.
Live people say zoom, du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du zoom, du-du-du-du-du zoom.
Everybody go...

[Lord Have Mercy]

Birds of a feather will flock together (damn)
Angry spirits will bring rotten weather (damn)
Shake spots with tremors and earthquakes forever (yeah)
Get it together, you better get it together
I study germs and muddy worms and discorrupt, apple
When rough vandals touch stables with they hands shackled
?Fakes it? with bracelets and lace it like cattle
Ooh, what a battle, ooh what a battle
When I hold you, under siege, like a hundred D's
In plain clothes, dungarees
And Somewhere Over the Rainbow
I flood emcees, on they knees, serioulies
The Lord moves in, mysterious ways
To watch for obsenity 
In these chumps city streets and tener jeeps
To avoid New York's Finest
Colorful sirens
In this jungle, I triumph, running the fort
Running it with torch
And blaze back stabbers like the Olympian fire brings (blah) cold-ass
Ghetto trips, the gold medalist
Then the click, oh to the sick and verbally spit
Third-degree, that break through your shell
Lord Have Mercy out, no doubt, I see you in Hell!

[Khrist]

Works of literature
Places the scriptures in my mind I see pictures
Twenty-four rims of hypnotism
Hold the pens in prison, had to risen
I heard my voice can control this
And to move within us
I ask the Lord every night to save my soul from Satan because I know the
devil's  living in my inner
Show my muscles like a python
Got a break when I changed (huh) smoke remains
Damaging my lungs an uncontrollable fury
Like the twisters, misters, cathing blisters 
from nine millimeters through they organ systems
Who knows if they gonna live, that's a choice that God gives em
I move strategic, (huh)
I'm D.V. alias Khrist and I'm not Jesus, what it is

Chorus:

Everybody, zoom, du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du zoom, du-du-du-du-du-du zoom.
Big Khrist say zoom, du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du zoom, du-du-du-du-du-du zoom.
zoom, du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du zoom, du-du-du-du-du-du zoom. zoom, du-du-du-du-
du-du-du-du zoom, du-du-du-du-du-du zoom.
