[Chorus]
we hear em talking dine
but we still
on the grind
crawlin' slow
tippin' dine
but we do it for h-town
we back up on the rise
feeling good
feeling fine
poppin' trunk
tippin' dine
but we do it for h-town
tell them boys its time to lay it dine
tell tell them boys its time to lay it dine
cause we do it for
cause we do it for
cause we do it for h-town
tell them boys its time to lay it dine
tell tell them boys its time to lay it dine
cause we do it for
cause we do it for
cause we do it for h-town

[Verse 1  Chamillionaire]
Even after the Ozone Awards is over
We still feeling like aint nobody colder
Still throwing twenty inch swangs on the Rover
Candy like they dated twenty fifth of October
Told ya'll to chill wit that instigatin'
You say you from the H and its instant hatin'
We started the trend you imitatin'
These swangas and voughes these isn't daytons
Seen us doing it in Harlem Knights
Say we do it big then you boys is right
Spending more dough than you saw in ya life
And that's just what ya boy spent on the dice
Instigatin' you instigatin' we gon' hold it dine yea ya'll see
Hate won't ever live as long as me
End of the bullet where the karma be
Why you wanna try to come talk to me
Try to ask me if Rick Ross still a G
Journalists need to get up off my D
Him and E-Class always kept it real with me
The rap game looking so childish lately
Told me the industry is bound to break me
Can't let the fakeness dominate me
Step up in the streets say its time to pay me
Aint never been a friend of the industry
I aint never been a friend of the gimmicky
I aint never been good with the chemistry
But let me tell ya'll clowns what its finna be
Texas aint as hot as it was so they say we aint as worth as much
Ringtone rappers actors dancers trappers they just outworking us
50 Cent working way harder baby
and Lil Wayne was working harder too
all of us was getting street paper but that was way before Carter 2
if you from Texas and a Screw head when I wrote this Verse I swear I thought
of you
another clique should've came behind us we already showed what working hard
would do
payed the price to live the major life but when we hear the hate we tell
boys to chill
Bun B the main Texas rapper holding Texas up right now for real
Pimp passed we should've learned from that we ought to all be helping Bun
rep the trill
Rep the swangs
Rep the paint
Rep the bang
Rep the grill
Seen Pat in a red Lincoln seen Slim Thug in a photo drop
So I had to chop off the roof take a picture of that and call it photo chop
Been riding clean
Since Rodney King
Martin Luther Dream and chrome monoblocks
All of us been repping Texas baby one thing I know is that it sho' don't
stop

[Chorus]
we hear em talking dine
but we still
on the grind
crawlin' slow
tippin' dine
but we do it for h-town
we back up on the rise
feeling good
feeling fine
poppin' trunk
tippin' dine
but we do it for h-town
tell them boys its time to lay it dine
tell tell them boys its time to lay it dine
cause we do it for
cause we do it for
cause we do it for h-town
tell them boys its time to lay it dine
tell tell them boys its time to lay it dine
cause we do it for
cause we do it for
cause we do it for h-town

[Verse 2  Slim Thug]
H-Town nawfside
That's where the boss ride
Haters get ya mouth wide
Ya insides outside
Talking down on my side
Naw we don't play that
Where you say that will be the same place you lay at
We been sipping drank by the pint since way back
We been candy paint on them 4s since they made that
Hop up in my fly ride watch the top lay back
Rather flip a drop 'Lac before I flip a Maybach
Wonder why I say that
I'm so hood
And it aint shit better than this leather and the wood
Got my diamonds looking good and my hand on remote
And I'm tucked in that buck while I float like a boat
Looking clean like soap
Diamond rope on my throat
And I'm feeling presidential please vote for the hope
If we vote for ya hope
Please answer one note
Let us get in mo' dough
Everybody going broke

[Chorus]
we hear em talking dine
but we still
on the grind
crawlin' slow
tippin' dine
but we do it for h-town
we back up on the rise
feeling good
feeling fine
poppin' trunk
tippin' dine
but we do it for h-town
tell them boys its time to lay it dine
tell tell them boys its time to lay it dine
cause we do it for
cause we do it for
cause we do it for h-town
tell them boys its time to lay it dine
tell tell them boys its time to lay it dine
cause we do it for
cause we do it for
cause we do it for h-town

[Verse 3  Trae]
King of the streets no days no sleep
Paint wet as hell with reptiles on the seats
Trunk got an attitude yelling out when it speak
Pissed off the top it been lost for a week
Slab looking like Shaq by the way it post up
Guaranteed to hit haters no less than close up
Niggas mad cause the south done rose up
Like Yao Ming big swangs on trucks
Find me in the hood on a couple of blocks
With a couple Aks and a couple of Glocks
No work in the trunk for a couple of stops
Duffle bag when I pay away a couple of cops
I dedicate this to Hawk and Pimp C
Moe and Fat Pat, Screw and Lil E
I rep them the same way I rep TDC
If it wasn't for them then what would I be
With diamonds I'ma stay shining bright
H-town all day and all night
I chose the pace to come take the throne
Cause some of these niggas aint living right
We slowed up shit and we changed the game
Copped the old school and we changed the frame
And wave the trunk that reads 'I Am the H'
Anything you saying you better change ya name

[Chorus]
we hear em talking dine
but we still
on the grind
crawlin' slow
tippin' dine
but we do it for h-town
we back up on the rise
feeling good
feeling fine
poppin' trunk
tippin' dine
but we do it for h-town
tell them boys its time to lay it dine
tell tell them boys its time to lay it dine
cause we do it for
cause we do it for
cause we do it for h-town
tell them boys its time to lay it dine
tell tell them boys its time to lay it dine
cause we do it for
cause we do it for
cause we do it for h-town</pre>
