[Justin]
I just wanna touch ya, yeah
The way you move
(The way you move)
Oh you make me love it, yeah
'Cause lady you cool

[Justin &amp; Pharrell]
That's the way
(That's the way)
Keep movin baby
(Keep movin baby)
Tell your girls
(Tell your girls)
To come join the table
(come join the table)
And don't you worry
(don't you worry)
Just keep movin boo
(keep movin boo)
'Cause you're the star
(you're the star)
Everybody lookin at you
(said they lookin at you)

And there ain't no doubt about it
Girl, the way you move
And there ain't no doubt about it
Hey girl, Baby you cool

[Game &amp; Justin]
G-A-M-E drop top Bentley
Gucci belt-buckle, fresh outta Italy
Ima balla, literally
Haters are swine flu
They killin me
I'm lookin down on ya from where the ceiling be
Me n my niggas swarm
Oh you like the killa bees
My chick ridin shotgun
Billie Jean
Half Belizean and half from The Philippines
Niggas energy
Its like they got the heave
Seekin me
Thinkin' they wanna 9 milli-me
But they ain't fo' that rat-tat-tat-tat
My bullets sing like they registered at ASCAP
Need I say more
I was single [?]
Everything I do exotic
I don't need to [?]
Mr. Red Carpet, I don't do awards
If you want it, I done it
Five million on tour
Fo 'sho

I just wanna touch ya, yeah
The way you move
(the way you move)
Oh you make me love it, yeah
'Cause lady you cool

That's the way
(That's the way)
Keep movin baby
(Keep movin baby)
Tell your girls
(Tell your girls)
To come join the table
(come join the table)
And don't you worry
(don't you worry)
Just keep movin boo
(keep movin boo)
'Cause you're the star
(you're the star)
Everybody lookin at you
(said they lookin at you)
And there ain't no doubt about it
Girl, the way you move
And there ain't no doubt about it
Baby you cool

Yo Pharrell
I'm ri-ridiculous
So so sick with it
You can call me cancer
But I don't smoke cigarettes
Come through in a 'Rari
Same color as licorice
If I ain't with them, my bitch be like
My niggas, shit,
Haters beware
I can see clear
Through these lens on this black Louis V yeah
Something 'bout Mary
Make me wanna blow up
And P got the dziaq for me when I show up (yeah)
Whip game crazy
I call it [?]
You're a big fish till you swim with piranhas
Used to call me dope Game
When I cop from Jose
Now I play Roosevelt and I cop Roses
Niggas be like you lease that
no way
California slim license plate Saint-Tropez
Eaten wit a table for a two place lobsters
Been a mobsters since a two way, holla</pre>
