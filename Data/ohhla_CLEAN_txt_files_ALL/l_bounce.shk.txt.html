[Sheek Louch]
Let's go Poobs, Sheek Louch {Mari-ohhh}

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Fuck that nigga let's bounce (let's bounce)
Get some dutches, I'm 'bout to get a ounce (get a ounce)
I ain't thinkin 'bout dawg, let's drink (let's drink)
I'm in the hood, army coat, no mink (ooh-wee)
Nigga's pussy and you know who you are
Without security don't even leave the car (nah)
I'ma be right here babe bro (yeah)
Sheek Louch, D-Block, y'all know (Sheek Louch) {MARIO!!!}

[Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo, whattup my niggaz? (Whattup niggaz?)
Put it in the air if you don't give a fuck my niggaz
Pour somethin dark brown in the cup my niggaz
and get drunk (get drunk) pop the trunk (pop the trunk)
Hey yo I'm back on my shit, they back on my dick
I'm hearin lil' things about beef with my clique
I'm readin these mags, I'm hearin these fags
Niggaz all know if they want it with the Gho'
We L-to-the-O, X amount of flow
Nice amount of dough but we okay (we okay)
But bet e'ry nigga in D-Block'll spray (D-Block!)
Feel me? Nevermind that (nevermind that) that's lightweight (that's lightweight)
I can end a whole battle with a light 8
Fuck a 16 (yeah) Sheek Louch mean (mean nigga!)
Everyday jeans, white tee clean (WOO)
We in the hood dawg, cops fuckin with us
Not fuckin with us, nigga come and get us
Spit razors out
Lil' black 45 rubber grips with the lasers out
Uhh, no security, big man soft
Down the block and I ain't even let the shit off
And I'm not platinum, and I'm not rich
But you would think I went diamond bitch (D-Block!)
Uhh, how the shows sold out
Nosebleed section and the grass where the chairs fold off
I don't hold out, Sheek Louch the truth
In the hood, in or out the booth, motherfucker

[Chorus] w/ some different ad libs

[Sheek Louch]
Fuck outta here, Jada whattup? Haha
Supa Mario, Jae Hood whattup?
This D-Block right here man
I'ma just let, y'knahmsayin?
Yo yo Poobs
I hope niggaz know what they doin man
Hehe, I swear to GOD
{Don't push the Mario man!}</pre>
