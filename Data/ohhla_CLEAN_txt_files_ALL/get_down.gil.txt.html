Typed by: muscleman112@optonline.net

It's a stick up 
Everybody freeze 
Everybody down to the ground 

Well which is it young feller? 
You want I should freeze or get down on the ground? 

Get down on the ground 
Git-git-git down on the ground 
Get down on the ground 
Git-git-git down on the ground 
Get down on the ground 
Git-git-git down on the ground 
Dow-down git-git-git-git-git down on the ground! Ho! 
Git-git-git down on the ground, Yeah! 
Get down on the ground, Ho! 
Git-git-git down on the ground, Chyeah! 
Get down on the ground, Ho! 
Git-git-git down on the ground, Chyeah! 

Gillie I'm the king of Philly yes 
So nigga bow down and kiss the ring and show respect 
These hataz talkin shit but naw these hataz ain't a threat 
See everything I do you know I do it for a check 
You see I keep my cartier frames and my seven jeans saggin 
And my platinum chains and that black on black dragon 
Know tha kid stay laughin when the cops run up on me talking bout 
Get down on the ground, (What!?) git-git-git down on the ground! 
I said shorty slow your roll cause you drawlin 
Had to change my number three times you keep callin 
Way I move that work my niggaz call me U-Haulin
Why you always broke your paper low see you stallin
Every bitch and whip that I got it looks foreign 
Had they spend they cool five grand up at the mall and
Hundred thousand dollaz on the Jones now that's flossin 
You spent forty thousand on a benz that's ballin? 
Nah! 

[Chorus]
Up in the hood man you know what's good we make em 
Get down on the ground 
Git-git-git down on the ground 
These suckaz be talkin shit till I pull up on they strip and tell em 
Get down on the ground, Cha-Chyeah! 
Git-git-git down on the ground 
The cops run on my block gunz cocked and they yellin 
Get down on the ground 
Git-git-git down on the ground 
Up in tha club spend that dough if you drop it to the floor it make em 
Get down on the ground, Huh!? 
Git-git-git down on the ground
Cha-Chyeah! 

Let these niggaz know the deal 
If you know the kid, then you that I am real 
And all the sudden I done came across a few haters 
Wanna see me locked up cause they seen the newspapers, Fuck em! 
You know I stay hustling and my team stay grindin 
So my niggaz they rubbin and the figures we shinin 
And you know I keep that pistol case as niggaz gotta problem, make em 
Get down on the ground, Huh!? 
Git-git-git down on the ground 
Cha-Chyeah! 

Homie is the figures we major
I done copped the chrome 45 and got the laser 
When it come to bitches take em all different flavors 
How is that your wife if she keep givin me favors 
Yes I'm corporate thuggin you might catch me in the blazer 
Mixin up the yellow with that purple call it Lakers 
Diamonds so big they comparin them to glaciers 
Gillie I be higher than a fuckin sky scraper 
Yes! 

[Chorus]

Gillie! 
If I don't know you I don't play much 
Married to the streets and no I'm not taking a pay cut
Real deal Evander Holyfield see I ain't made up 
Got the baddest bitch her pocket book is Mark Jacobs, Yes! 
My pinky ring shinin and my seat reclinin in that Bentley right 
And you can barely see the time 
And then you know I keep that strap in case lil homie gotta problem make em 
Get down on the ground 
Git-git-git down on the ground 

You see Gillie tossin dollaz outa low low 
I'm the king of Philly and these little niggaz so so 
Swagger is ridiculous they wanna steal my mojo 
Walk up in the club they cuff there bitches like oh no 
See it's the king of Philly keep the club rockin 
Gillie's flow is heroin I keep your head noddin 
When the beef is on I'm everywhere see I ain't hidin 
You Tre off of +Boyz N the Hood+ you ain't ridin', Nah!

[Chorus]

See this is brought to ya by Figure 4 life entertainment nigga 
Where we all about dollaz 
If it don't make dollaz then it don't make cents 
And for that dolla we will make a nigga get down on the ground 
Ya hear me?
