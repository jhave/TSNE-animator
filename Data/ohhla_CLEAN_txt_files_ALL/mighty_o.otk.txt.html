[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
You ain't a hater can't tell
Either wish me well, go to hell or go to Yale
Study human behavior so that you know who the hell
You dealing with ain't nutty but the study going to unvail
My relative in jail (Ha) stay in engaged
To whatever make money now he married to that cage
Divorce is not an option and prenunptial is void
Eat up whatever after but I'm tangled in my cord (hum)
Bored, kind of like a night with the sword
Without dragon to battle so I'm running from a shadow
An immpossible feat and I repeat
An immpossible feat and I repeat
An immpossible feat and I repeat!
The damsel's in distress but they a mess
They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and think that they getting warmer
They only getting colder hell, maybe I should throw
A double diamond party in the north pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will turn up us to see who can be me
Better than me it's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style
But that's ok just make sure you don't touch that dial
And we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool
Look, I'll get you hooked, y'all crooks might even move
To Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter
Start a new life, and all that wrong you do you make it right
But hell, all a dream I wear the crown I'm king
Respect is mandatory end of the story go fly a kite
Category ain't got none you know I'm right

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Congratulations I'm a player
I thought you were one too but now I hear you loud and clear
Subliminal, criminal minded niggaz so be aware
Black dog broke out the pits and told yo' ass it's 'bout to tear
Intended for anyone fillin out this application
An estimate is needed for your under-estimation
I'm firing on the spot go back and check your calculation
Like a sniper in the bushes with that rifle I've been patiently waitin
Now that's a virtue; cause pussy nigga I'll hurt you
Like the president's approval rating by servin yo' ass with words fool
Slam yo' back to the curve bruh like sanitation worker
Cause you're trash I'm taking out the trash and all trash
Get mashed and compacted because it's no longer valid
Go head recyled, repackaged and put it back in my cabinet
Boy thats germs, I'm fresh up out the store every time
That nigga that B-I-G go hard every rhyme
Crowns all around I'm right after Martin Luther
No J R period senior 'cause Bamboo is Antwone Junior
Dungeon Family and biologicals intact
Talk bad about the fam test diabolical attack
No gats or no raps, you get slapped about that
As a matter of fact, not fiction
Rumpelskiltsken you wack
Decipher words is like the Code of Da Vinci
Don't go against me, (Hey)
I want you to go out there and kill them marks boy is you with me
Mighty ighty ighty ighty ighty ighty O
The worse thing since Crack/Cocaine distributed to the poor
By the government, oh I meant, don't nobody know
Conspiracy theory, you be the judge, nobodys slow
