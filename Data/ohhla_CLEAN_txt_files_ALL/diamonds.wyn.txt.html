[Chorus]
Di-diamonds and girls (uh oh) di-diamonds and girls (uh oh)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
GET EM, UH
Like five, six chains on
Slick Rick, no patch, just frames on
Marc Jacobs Aviators and a v-neck
Ten bitches, ten pistols on a P-jet
In a drop top Madina, with the top up
I'm in that bitch gettin neck, like a shore port
100,000 for the grill if I lie, I die
Flow sick so sick see the syanide
And here's my most funniest joke, i'm broke (hahaha)
Dont worry 'bout me, the money got me
And I keep the burner on me like an id
The Lamborghini orange like vitamin c
And leave a bitch stuck like a kite in a tree
Weezy F. B, the money is the matter
I'm workin like a bad bladder, M.O.B
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 2: Currency]
Yeah
Hailin from the bottom of the map
But standin at the top of the game
Kush got a nigga lookin like I could really use a nap
But I'm still out wildin with the gang
Got diamonds in my chain mo colors than a order light
Life is a traffic jam but I'm on the motor bike
Jig-jaggin past these bastards, laughin at em
I got em suicidal like the doors on a Phantom, yeah
Hot spitta nigga who you thought it was
Bitches wanna hold me in the mornin like a coffie mug
I dont try to lock em down cause i'am not an officer
I just knock em down in groups ten
As if I'm in the lane aint meant for bowlin pins
Then the style switch so quick, havin you thinkin that the disk skip
Pimpin serious, Make em bring it back like past interference
Yeah
 
[Chorus] 2X
 
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
G'yeah
Speed boat, Wife beater
Ballin like Derek Jeater for every reason
That testeroaster can get ghost like it ever seen ya
The same color as sesamia diarrhea
The pioneer, i'am here
Right here, The watch nasty like gonnarhea
Money long like Nia, I appear via satelite
Who ever dont the premier he a hermaphrodite
? up in my ear, get it clear
Pretty women want this nigga right here, like Richard Gere
I switch the gear then steer and disappear
And if I ever jump off a peer I would probably fly
 
[Chorus] 4X</pre>
