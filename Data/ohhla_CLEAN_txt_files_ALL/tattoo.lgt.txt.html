(talking)
Damn girl, you got a tattoo right there
I like that, ooh shit, sexy than a motherfucker
Can I kiss that

(Chorus - 2x)
Is it on your chest (uh huh)
Is it on your back (uh huh)
Is it on your leg (uh huh)
Is it buy your cat (uh huh)
Where your tat, tat, tatty
Let me see your tattoo girl
Where your tat, tat, tatty
Let me see your tattoo girl

[Liffy Stokes]
Hey there shorty, what you working with
Let me see you pop that shit for daddy
That's shining blowing big pound out a pro caddy pick up
Diamonds flick up protect your tip tattoo bezel that lift up
Blinding them ?booshy? hoes
I bends through the Gucci store
Grinning, Sprewells spinning, but I'm standing still
Man trying to call up this zig-zotic hot mama out by the Ville then
I'm talking top flight, high priced brown sugar
With the curly butter, thick hips and all 
With the easy-e kitty cat paws, tatted above her bra
When the Twist sat down by her draws
But I guess that leaves dust and all
Cause a man keeps on running off
Just dropping her cheese, but shorty got me's
Taking trips to the tat shop, come on the black top
Let her feel Anita while we sold b's
Cause you really gotta get greedy
Fish that pearl, and then show it off to the world
Thickness shorty got niggas out here screaming
Let me see your tattoo girl

(Chorus)

[Bennie Franks]
It's Mr. Fat, freaky, black, nasty and here for money grams
It's something bout a red bone tattoo, god damn
You need a cover up, X out your baby daddy name
Girl I know you love to fuck, just the way you took the pain
Check my name and Eddy came, oops I don't mean to be rude
I got a fetish for oops I mean I love some tattoos
Let's get up on a room, everything is on me
Ain't got an A and the ointment but I got some Vaseline
The Brandi, I can't stand it the way my mess 
And let's get stranded, I kizzel my nizzel fa shizzel 
My cameras handy, bumping to this shit type to break the walls down
In Miami, top notch swallow and keep the ostrich and get up

(Chorus - 2x)

[High Beam]
I guess you with me like a reeeeal
And then she suck me like a neckbone
I've been gone slap then I took the Milly that home
Since nobody needed to drive I'ma be the one they gone put it on
(did you know me daddy) Man I ain't even have to ask shorty
It was right before my eyes, tattoos on her chest
Snake wrapped around her legs all the way up to her thighs
Her size, scrumptious fulfilling the fantasy of me and my guys
When she pulled her pants down 
Made me wanna buck she oh my, what a surprise
Man I'm hoping, she'll let a nigga get it wet I gets wild and open
Way too provoking, on the beach rubbing her body down with suntan lotion
What's that, another tat with the Playboy bunny by her cootie cat
Got one going in the crack of her ass 
But she can't really see cause her booty fat
Girl you don't know what I'd do to that
got limo scrapes ride the butter crack
Put Legit Ballin all across your back, take that off and let me see that

(Chorus)

[Lenny Hooks]
Sip the cris and light the hydro
Spider chick across the dance flo'
Pimps like them tilt the kango
At the club she shotguns 6-0-0
Straight to the Mo' she came out, her clothes
Tattooed up like her nails ain't gold
I'm searching around like I'm 5-0
I'm bout to put something on it this ain't no tattoo hoe</pre>
