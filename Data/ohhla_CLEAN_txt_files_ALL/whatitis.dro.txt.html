[Chorus] 2X
Hey you a killer? (what it is) Hell yeah (what it is)
Drug dealer (what it is) Yeah playa
Ridin tall (I just wanna sit up in the air)
Get high (I just wanna be up in the air)

[Verse 1]
I'm in the air (come down) I ain't comin down (why?)
Up here damnit (where?) I ain't comin down (please)
Bubblicious car 26's in the town

[Verse 2]
My car actually Willy Wonka factory
Ice look like rasberry these hoes tryna tackle me
Nigga I'm a killer I suggest you don't come after me
Bitch I be in College Park plus I be on Mackafee
Bankhead faculty boy you need to rap with me
Come and talk to me 'fore I open up ya cavity
Shots come rapidly I told ya not to blast at me
I don't play wit lil boys you tryna Michael Jackson me?
Know a nigga ride in the air fantastically
Til the day they kill us I never put my rims up
Actually car flop purple when the sun come
When it get dark boy that thang look like a ???

[Chorus] 2X
Hey you a killer? (what it is) Hell yeah (what it is)

[Verse 3]
Mink coat (brrrrr) shit polar bear
Hoes over here (what) hoes over there (yeah)
I'm bout to take flight I'm goin in the air (I'm gone)
Candy wit the gloss I'm bout to lift it off (yes)
You see somethin on me you don't like then lick it off (lick)
We don't need to look at a tag we rip 'em off (rip)
My wrist forty but guess how much TIP costs? (how much)
Bout a hundred K (what) I don't wanna play (what)
Young Dro ridin tall on a summer day (do it)
Sellin dope it be junkies where my mama stay (fa real)
Bad hoes get treated like runaways
Bitch you need to go home cool out and smoke a blunt a day
Gon' say it ho my Cutlass look like egg yolk
You know I keep a tool wit me all in the bed though
My money fat though it's Grand Hustle bread broke
We just 28 inches in the air what you scared fo'?

[Chorus] 2X
Hey you a killer? (what it is) Hell yeah (what it is)
Drug dealer (what it is) Yeah playa
Ridin tall (I just wanna sit up in the air)
Get high (I just wanna be up in the air)
