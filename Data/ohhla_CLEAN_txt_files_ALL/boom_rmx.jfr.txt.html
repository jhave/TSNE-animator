[Fresh Prince - talking]
Yeah, and here we go
(*people talking in background*)
Break down
'Til the beat go
'Til the beat go
Break down
'Til the beat go

[Fresh Prince]
Here I go, yo back up now and give a brother room
The fuse is lit and I'm about to go boom
Mercy, mercy, mercy me
Uh, my life is a cage but on stage I'm free
Hyped up, psyched up, ready for wilin'
Standin in a crowd of girls like a island
I see the one I want, I said "come here cutie"
I flip her around and then I work that booty
Work the body, work, work the body
Slow down girl you're 'bout to hurt somebody
Hold up, yo let's get just one thing clear
There's only one reason why I came here

[Break - Fresh Prince] (Crowd)
Ya really done want me to tigga, tigga, tigga tell ya what's up (GO)
Ya really done want me to tigga, tigga, tigga tell ya what's up (GO)
Ya really done want me to tigga, tigga, tigga tell ya what's up (GO)
I came here tonight to hear the crowd go

[Chorus - Crowd]
(Boom! shake, shake, shake the room)
(Boom! shake, shake, shake the room)
(Boom! shake, shake, shake the room)
(Tic, tic, tic, tic, boom)

[Break - Fresh Prince] (Crowd)
Well yo are ya'll ready for me yet?
(Pump it up Prince)
Well yo are ya'll ready for me yet?
(Pump it up Prince)
Well yo are ya'll ready for me yet?
(Pump it up Prince)
Well here I go, here I go here I, here I go

[Fresh Prince]
Yo, dance in the aisles when the Prince steps to it
The rhyme is a football ya'll and I went and threw it
Out in the crowd and yo it was a good throw
How do I know?, because the crowd went (HO)
In response to the way that I was kickin it
Smooth, an individual, rhymes always original
Like the Dr. Jekyl man and this is my 'Hyde' side
I am the driver and you're on a rap ride

[Break - Fresh Prince] (Crowd)
So fellas (yeah)
Are ya'll with me? (yeah)
I said fellas (yeah)
Are ya'll with me? (yeah)
Why don't you tell the girls what ya'll wanna do
Ya wanna (oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ew)
That's right yo and I'm in the flow
So pump up the volume along with the tempo
I want everybody in the house to know
I came here tonight to hear the crowd go

[Chorus] - 2X - w/ ad libs

[Fresh Prince - talking during chorus and into break]
Yeah
Break it on DOWN, uh
Yeah, give 'em it
Uh, bring it back to 'em
Yeah, c'mon now

[Break - DJ Jazzy Jeff - *scratching*] - w/ ad libs
"Mix" - repeated

[*solo scratching*]

[Chorus]

[Fresh Prince]
Here I go
The F-f-f-f-Fresh P-p-p-p-Prince is who I am
So tell my mother that I never make a whack jam
But sometimes I get n-nervous and start to stutter
And I f-fumble every word, for word I utter
So I just try to ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chill
But it gets worse-a but worse-a but-but-but worse still
I need the c-c-c-crowd to k-k-k-kick into it
They help me calm down and I can get through it
So higher higher, get ya hands to the ceilin
Let it go ya'll don't fight the feelin
Mic in a strangle hold, sweat pourin
And like Jordan yo I'm scorin
Yeah that's right ya'll and I am in the flow
So pump up the volume, along with the tempo
Many have died tryin to stop my show
I came here tonight to here the crowd go

[Chorus] - 4X - w/ ad libs

[Fresh Prince - talking over chorus]
Yeah, uh
Kick it to 'em right here
Don't stop ..
All night long
And I'm outta here

[Outro]
"Break down" - repeated until fade</pre>
