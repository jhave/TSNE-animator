Blue Eyes mixtape
I got some in my soul
Blue Eyes, collect this mixtape, Lil B, very rare
Make sure you download my new Gold House
Download my new Gold House mixtape, coming right after this

As my soul burns slow
And the ashes from my blunt keep my thoughts all froze
How I make it this far in the pad then the road?
How I walking every day when my boy's casket closed?
What I deserve to be here?
With this stress upon my mind but music free the land
I can't stop
That's before the push or after?
My head right, my heart right, I'm ready for the war
I'm not playing the talk like most other niggas
And don't walk like them sucka niggas
I got the game fucked up, I think I love a stripper
But off GP bitch, I'd never tip her
And you seen me on top
A few close ones gon be with me when I drop
My life is a daily watch
Just bought a new home
But I don't feel that home
Why you let your baby roam
When they feel grown?
I know I got your back, that's why you feel this song
Long nights niggas put me on the back burner
How I'm finna eat? How I'm finna sleep?
How I'm finna get minds in the better space?
Top floor penthouse, that's a better place
Pistols coming out the wall, you just press the 8
Buttons on front of the door in case you niggas break
In, I'm waiting, the day ends, when they in, nobody wins
When I lose, I'm turning on the TV
Wouldn't play it in my shoes [?]
Your love life, well bitch, respect what I do
Real friends beat the test to find you
From your past that was left behind you
I can't see through the lights but I'm next in line to
Grind too, grind so hard, I'm... the rhyme...
