I see the moon, a million stars are out tonight
Gentle reminders of the way you are
A sea of glass, a raging storm has come to pass
You show your face in an array of ways

My feet may venture to the ground
But you will never let me down
I can't hold it in
My soul is screaming

Hey you, I'm into Jesus
Hey you, I'm into Jesus, oh yeah
Hey you, I'm into Jesus
Hey you, I've seen the truth
And I believe

I know you're there
I feel your love through my despair
You speak the words that ease away the pain
My heart is free, my eyes are clear
My soul is healed
Now that you have got a hold on me

[Bridge]
I still believe, I still believe
Hey you, this kid is back
And I do declare that the son is shining
Hey you, the kid is back
With a red alert cause it might be blinding
Hey you, the kid is back
And I do declare that the son is shining
Hey you, the kid is back

[Chorus]</pre>
