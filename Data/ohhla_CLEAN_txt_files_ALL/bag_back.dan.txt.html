Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I lived my whole life for a green piece of paper
Results of chasin' that
Raiders on respirators
Wanna make a deal?
Gotta talk to ya later
They say I'm immature like babies in incubators
Motherfuckers I'm a don
Hood phenomenon
Game so tight I can serve Farrakhan
A bacon double cheese burger, nigga that's unheard of
Koch that, pop that, you never heard of cause
I'm all about murder
Bloody bloody murder
Pound flipper, bitch getter, four clip inserter
Chase the thunder bread like Urkel did Laura
You get in my way and an oceano snorkel

And I dog these hoes like a Georgetown Hoya
When I get locked you gotta talk to my lawyer
So be cool nigga, sit back, relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"
I just talked to him give him 15 minutes
So please have patience, dawg we gon' get it
So be cool nigga sit back relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"

I'm in the hood all day
Where the fuck are you niggas?
Glennwood stove
A loosie and two swishers
And what you don't know
I'm about to teach ya
For them Ben Franklin's niggas singin' like Aretha
Smokin' sour diesel with this bitch named Keyshia
So much lip gloss she fuckin' up the swisher
I'm a real nigga
And nigga you ain't
You a bitch ass nigga, nigga I ain't
Unforgivable
Nigga you bit the fo'
Give it to a nigga now he bleedin' like menstrual
Cycle, you might grow, shoot like Ivo
Monster and the letter man, Thriller like Michael

And I dog these hoes like a Georgetown Hoya
When I get locked you gotta talk to my lawyer
So be cool nigga, sit back, relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"
I just talked to him give him 15 minutes
So please have patience, dawg we gon' get it
So be cool nigga sit back relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"</pre>
