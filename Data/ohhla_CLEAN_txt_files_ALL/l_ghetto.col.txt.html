Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, uh
Uh, yea
Yea, uh
Fayettenam, nigga
Hahaah uh
Carolina, nigga
Yeah, Yea, let's bring it in

Yea, this is for my niggaz in the struggle
Yea, this is for my niggaz in the struggle
Uh, uh, uh
Nothing but sweat, tears
Just another perspective
Yeah

Yo, uh
Lifestyles of the young, black and genius
Sons strapped with guns packed in jeans
And the blunts got my lungs black as Jesus, (yea)
Play with killers hung yack and slung crack for leisure
And tell a nigga run that and gun clap for sneakers
Young niggaz emulate what's coming out the speakers
So everything we learn came from rappers, not teachers
Cause if we can't relate, then how the hell you gonna reach us?
Surrounded by crooked cops and preachers, (yea) Where my trust at?
No time to think about illegal when my stomachs touching
By any means, nigga, even if the gun is busted
I see the world for what it is now
I see the odds is looking slim for our kids now
Cause, uh, it was a set up for my people to rise, (yea)
My niggaz slang, but I see the pain deep in they eyes
Niggaz living like they don't give a fuck
And I don't blame 'em, it's a cold world, live it up! (live it up)

The things that I've seen, (seen)
The dreams that I dream, (dream)
The rain in my sky
The pain in my eyes
But know that it gets better baby
Hope that it gets better baby
Don't let this world break you, (you) naw, naw
Don't let them break you, (you)

Yea, uh
I look up in the sky, see that ghetto birds circulate
And rollers on the block, my niggaz on the curb, cursin them, (fuck)
Another day in the ville, do I stay in and chill? (no)
Or go play in the field?
Help my mother paying these bills, you tell me, nigga!
We all young, black, some strapped
Them whites had they lunch pack for school, we had our guns stacked
And all a nigga wanna do is take his mother from that
But they'd rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back
To kill a nigga over beef and cheddar is even better
Just one less coon they won't have to arrest
Fuck a crooked cop three times
Bitch, I'm getting cake and ain't a nigga finna eat mine
That's why a nigga looking like a street sign, (yea)
Posted on the corner 'til it's sleep time
Wake up and it's feeling like somebody hit the rewind, (why)
Cause them ghetto birds circulate, my niggaz steal purse and 'em
Another day in the city, my niggaz say it with me, yea!

The things that I've seen, (seen)
The dreams that I dream, (dream)
The rain in my sky
The pain in my eyes
But know that it gets better baby
Hope that it get better baby
Don't let this world break you, (you) naw, naw
Don't let them break you, (you)</pre>
