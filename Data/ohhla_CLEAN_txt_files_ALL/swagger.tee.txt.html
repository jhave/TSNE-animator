Song:   Swagga Like Us
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com

[Intro/Chorus 4X: sample of M.I.A.'s "Paper Planes"]
"No one on the corner has swagger like us"
"Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us"

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
{"No one on the corner"} Mr. West is in the buildin
Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion
{"No one on the corner"} Aiyyo I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?
Hermes pastel, I pass the dressin
My attitude is tattooed
That mean it's permanent, so I guess we should address it, huh?
{"No one on the corner"} My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track, I asthma attack it
Why he so mad for? Why he gotta have it?
Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
How it feel to wake up and be the shit, and the urine?
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
Tryna get that Kobe number, one over Jordan

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Geah..
{"No one on the corner"} Got a bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by jackin my fresh
Jackin-jackin my fresh, jackin-jackin my fresh
Follow my steps is the road to success
Where the niggaz know you're thorough when the girls say yes (yes!)
{"No one on the corner"} But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school but you can't buy class
{"No one on the corner"} School of hard knocks I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap
It's Hooooo-vahhhhh
Dippin different Rovers, whippin with the soda
Hooooo-vahhhhh
Did you even have any doubt after "Doubt" it was over

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
No one on the corner has swagger like moi
Church, but I'm too clean for the choir
I require, what I desire
I got stripes, A-di-das
Mamis scream, "¡Papi no más!"
Run up in your shit, just me, no Moss
Runnin this shit like I got fo' thighs
No one has swagger like these fo' guys
Now when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than the swag or dagger all metal
And my jew-els, blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet make you feel special
Ha! What the fuck you boys talkin 'bout?
I know it's us cause we the only thing to talk about
And I'm gone... bye

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Yeah, hah, you think? That's right; ay
You can go see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the bird play
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect, only spit to serve a purpose
You ain't livin what you kickin then you worthless
Lookin from the surface it may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work to see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off, blast off and have outstandin quality
Sell a lot of records, I'll respect it and salute that
But spittin real life on hot beats, I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin revolutionary, nothin less than legendary
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

[Chorus]

[T.I. - over Chorus]
Okay, yeah, that's right
Okay, yeah, so you notice huh?
Hah, yeah, okay, tell 'em for me shawty
Yeah, that's right, yeah

[Chorus] - echoes at the end</pre>
