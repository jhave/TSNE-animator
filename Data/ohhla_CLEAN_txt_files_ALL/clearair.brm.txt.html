Yuh dun know yuh know, mi nah tell yuh now!!! Mi nah tell yuh how di dance done now!!

[Chorus: Akon] (Busta Rhymes)
I wanna clear the air
With the medal that's known to divide the whole atmosphere (Yeah!)
And I love to share
Them bullets come a dime a dozen I kept two so I could have spare (So historic!)

And don't get too close, make no mistakes about it I let it goooooooo!!!!!!!!!

Don't even ask I had to go dig in my stash
And pull out somethin that will remind you of a Jammy's soundclash

And clear the air

[Verse 2: Shabba Ranks]
Some a fi look, some a fi stare, some a fi jump, some a fi cheer
From Halfway Tree right back to Madison Square
Busta Rhymes back in here coolin wid di chandelier chair
Shabba Rankin step up! Yeah! Inna higher gear
Dem love di clothes dat I wear I swear
Share it pon di song it a fi just souvenir
It's not di turtle it's not di hare, Busta kill and they will fear
Wid di heart of a lion slaughta bull like a deer
Murda murda murda undertaker deh near
Di forty four magnum buss it loud and clear
We chop it and we slap it inna di fold right here
If yuh diss yuh surely shall disappear, yuh hear

[Chorus: Akon] (Busta Rhymes)
I wanna clear the air
With the medal that's known to divide the whole atmosphere (Akon sing to 'em!!!!)
And I love to share
Them bullets come a dime a dozen I kept two so I could have spare
Cause you never know, make no mistakes about it I let it goooooooo!!!!!!!!!
(How many times am I gonna have to beat y'all in the head!!!)
And don't get too close, make no mistakes about it I let it goooooooo!!!!!!!!!
And clear the air (Let's go)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Remember this! And due to observation watch the domination
Busta, Shabba and 'Kon phenomenal combination
Every gun fi let off!!! As soon as you hear the kid
And tell dem bwoy to step off!!!! Just look at the shit we did
(BLOCKA BLOCKA!!!!) Gun pop off again when we step upon di scene
And leave a shit in di place, reach yuh magazine
You peep the way we comin were controllin everywhere
We launch the missile clearin the air, yeah

[Chorus: Akon]
I wanna clear the air, with the medal that's known to divide the whole atmosphere
And I love to share, them bullets come a dime a dozen I kept two so I could have spare
Cause you never know, make no mistakes about it I let it goooooooo!!!!!!!!!
And don't get too close, make no mistakes about it I let it goooooooo!!!!!!!!!
I wanna clear the air, with the medal that's known to divide the whole atmosphere
And I love to share, them bullets come a dime a dozen I kept two so I could have spare
Cause you never know, make no mistakes about it I let it goooooooo!!!!!!!!!
And don't get too close, make no mistakes about it I let it goooooooo!!!!!!!!!
And clear the air</pre>
