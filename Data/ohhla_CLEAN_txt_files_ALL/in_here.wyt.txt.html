[Verse 1]
You can step the fuck up off of me (bitch)
I done already told ya you ain't stoppin me (bitch)
Wit killers from the camp that got the back of me (bitch)
You shoulda known I was part of the family (bitch)
Before I'm bout to rock the fuckin industry (bitch)
And plus I'm representin Memphis Tennesee (bitch)
And I ain't givin up until I'm seven feet (bitch)
Yes I said seven thats one foot deeper see (bitch)
Yall really do not know wats about to approach (bitch)
I'll kill ya quicker then a some raid could kill a roach (bitch)
I'm rawer then your dick when it rub against the panties (bitch)
Could give a fuck if I don't ever see a grammy (bitch)
I'm gone keep rockin only what I know and see (bitch)
And what I see I write it down and then begin to speak (bitch)
You have no fuckin reason to be hatin me(bitch)
But I guess aggrevation just come wit being me (bitch)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I wake up early twist the blunt up (bitch)
Stumblin from the night before still fucked up (bitch)
Couldn't tell ya wat I did in the last 24 (bitch)
Weed, xanex and syrup yea I'm on the floor (bitch)
But don't think that won't stop your jaw from gettin broke (bitch)
I got a bunch of killers that be on the fuckin scope (bitch)
And plus my killers came wit four-fours aimed at your throat (bitch)
You ain't got no time to run and you already know (bitch)
Your heart took a pause when Wyte walked in the door (bitch)
Your hoes pussy got moist when I began to flow (bitch)
And know the subject matter in hands I come wit mo (bitch)
The louder I spit my style the crowd will larger grow (bitch)
The bigger the crowd gets the more the money flows (bitch)
The bigger pockets I'm rockin gon make me give ya mo (bitch)
I got a destination in life and know thats for sho (bitch)
Infactuated wit music, good drugs and fuckin hoes (bitch)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The name is Lil Wyte and I'ma set it straight (bitch)
You fuckin wit me you fuckin wit the bay (bitch)
Crucial consequences repeat what you say (bitch)
Molded myslef now how could you have made (bitch)
Left it all bloody when I stepped off the stage (bitch)
Murdered the mic and then went out on a rage (bitch)
Slicin' n dicin' these rappers heads wit blades (bitch)
Your musics amusing but I am not amazed (bitch)
My skill had been sheltered almost like I been caged (bitch)
I been skipped over once and turned to another page (bitch)
Like these other dummies that got dropped off of this label (bitch)
I'm not gon let this money have me snortin off the table (bitch)
But I'm gon make it snappy for approval if I'm able (bitch)
This here is not a lie, a story, a fib or even a fable (bitch)
With HCP and Lil Wyte a perfect combination (bitch)
The crunkest, wildest, toughest motherfuckers in the nation (bitch)

[Chorus]
