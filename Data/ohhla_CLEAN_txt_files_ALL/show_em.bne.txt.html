Bizzy Bone:

Ooooh, we don't wanna murda ya, and it's so mysterious 
How many niggas wanna kill us will they run up? 
Come kill me hater, murder with the ak.

Northcoast keep goin. 
Ready for the Midwest invasion

But we poets and if you don't squash it, fuck some rap shit.

Bone

Krayzie Bone: 
Krayzie up in this muthafucka 
Nigga I'm rollin', and ain't leavin' this muthafucka untill somebody dead! 
And even though we know niggas bust back. 
Big bullets givin' muthafuckas heart attacks. 
Unload Tat-tat-tat-tat! 
Krayzie Bone never did roll with no hoes, 
Hell naw  we lettin' muthafuckas know. 
Everybody on the floor! 
And this aint no goddamn joke! 
Nigga, break yourself or get broke! 
All I want is the money 
my cash flow 
and I'm leaving on the first thing smoking out to Cleveland 
We gotta get even. 
Even if it means I got to stop a muthafucka from breathin. 
And I'm waitin' for niggas to plot to rob me. 
Nigga that can explain the reason you fucked up, bleedin. 
Never forgot about guns, never forgot how to load  em 
never forgot how to shoot em. 
Always a thug nigga what? 
Fuck it, let's shoot up the club.
If any of you niggas get pumped 
thinkin' you thug and you jump, nigga, you goin' get stomped. 
And we goin' shut this whole thang down 
Going out with a big bang, pow! 
And that's how the thugs do it 
You know we get down and dirty
Nigga, you know the story, donât make me, boil me 
Letâs get ready for war 
Last year we was humble, nigga, this year we heartless 
So, any nigga that want static 
come meet us outside in the Yard, bitch!

Layzie Bone:
Itâs a hell of a job, when you marry the mob
I put a ring on my finger and say goodbye to my kids 
Never ever will I be a legal citizen collectinâ my dividends til the law 
ends, flossin 
Rollin in my Benz I go against the grain 
see, we ainât go change
I take an eye for a eye
Either thug or you die, and I ainât goin cry. 
Rock a bye bye, nigga, die-die 
Got a grudge against the judge 
tryinâ to lock up my thugs 
wanna see us fall short 
Fuck it, Iâma blow up the court and show âem no remorse. 
Hit âem up with the C4, backdoor 
Nigga, let Stack go 
Iâma attack with rap and show the crooked ass law no love 
Better let dogs loose 
Got him, hold him up
and on top of that, these niggas fuckin' with cuz 
All the real niggas in the streets with heat
If you really got beef, then buck it, fuck it 
Nigga get disgusted, commit that 187 in public 
If you runninâ for your life 
In hot pursuit and you got to shoot to stay free, scream, 
Murda on the government, take me 
No surrender, no retreat 
Might as well say, 
Fuck this rappinâ, whatâs happenin? 
Layzie  goin out blastin Iâm smashin on any muthafucka who be thinkin they 
gon 
get they ass off without gettinâ a little action. 
I crept and I came, down for my thang, man. 
Itâs a different game. 
Muthafuckas out callinâ my name, but Iâma keep it the same 
Figured I changed, nigga, fuck the fame 
It ainât no mystery about mine 
Same little nigga from the double nine 
Everytime, I keeps it real with shit you can feel, still to the glock glock

Wish Bone:
Aw yeah, Iâma hit 'em with the murda mo.
See âem, better let it go 
Bet they gonâ run, run. Nine millimeter plus  
I got a nigga beat or when it ainât enough 
I got my shotgun 
Now, how many niggas wanna roll with me? 
Yâall say you real, then weâll see 
Will you ride for me? 
Will you die for me? 
If I pop somebody, straight up lie for me? 
There he go, now slowly approach 
start buckin' but baby, no kills 
Hit him low, we gotta get money so fuck it 
just show him whatâs real
Cause it's all about money, money, yeah 
Donât get in my way 
Fuckinâ with my money
cause that could surely get you killed 
Better find somebody to play with âcause I really ainât out to play bitch 
Serious âbout mine âcause youâre runninâ out of time 
and talkinâ that shit'll get you touched, bitch 
Now you know that we ainât into that rappin back and forth on no song
 Shit, like we ainât got nothinâ else to talk about but you on that hoe shit 
There go Cleveland 
lets get it over with

Flesh n Bone:
Get the fuck outta my way 
They say they move down and side to side 
I beg to part your stupid ass clean out my path 
nigga, when the bullet blow! 
One bullet for this silly muthfucka! 
Your bloodbath, baby livinâ in the day that made me sick in tha head 
So crazy, interrogation 
So many haters aggravate, so I convey and toss grenades 
You niggas wanna be the T H U G? 
Please, like me but canât see me 
Bend and roll like a fuckin hog 
Muthafuck, 5th Dawg is definitely too damned greedy, sleazy 
So many hoes screamin, bitch, skeeze me 
Tease my nuts, get up on the thug stroll darlin 
Stack my dollars up to the ceiling 
Nigga, with a mob and creepin through the neighborhood robbin damn 
Itâs a man on the roof with a gun, better run 
Itâs your chance 
Runnin through servin a dum dum to you 
I'm a unique Bone Thug man 
Stop wonderin' why did he leave that bloody, dead body gone 
The nigga thought he could fuck with mine 
but youâll never find no others more like my kind 
You heard my niggas willinâ to get down and dirty 
I donât give a fuck! 
See the villian trudgin, nigga, peelin slugs! 
A muthafucka here to show you who the realest thugs and thatâs us
the original thugstas 
Subliminal criminal way to kill an individual 
Bone clone niggas that thinkinâ that they invincible 
but not a real 
I'm here to let you know, for sure, hoes!

Yeah niggas 
Bone back in the house once again
