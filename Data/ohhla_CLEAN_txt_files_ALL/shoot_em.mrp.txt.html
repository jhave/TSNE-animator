[Master P]
A 211 in progress
Cause i'm the type of nigga that the police can't arrest 
I'm going crazy, kickin' down doors 
Breakin' in homes, and with my nine, i'm robbin' fuckin' liquor stores 
I'm droppin' things on you punk ass bitches 
From the streets and I keep 'em all listenin'
Suckas tried to play the P in nine-one
I came with fuckin' rhymes like a shotgun
I'm breakin' 'em like bouldas 
A million plus fans and mother fuckas I told ya
That the P would come through like a bullet 
Cock the mic like a gauge, grab the handle and then pull it
Don't give a fuck about the radio nigga 
Gangsta lyrics that make my mother fuckin' partners bigger
I roll around town four niggas deep
Bumpin' shit like fuck the police
See I can never fuckin' sell out
I was born in the ghetto, so the ghettos what I talk about 
One wrong move in the game and your fucked 
And if I think your going do me, i'm gonna shoot your ass up
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up 
Shoot 
Shoot the mother fuckas up 
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up 
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 
Shoot the mothe fuckas up
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up 
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up      
Shoot the mother fuckas 
Shoot the mother fuckas up

Alot of labels try to play in nine-two
They didn't really think the P would come through 
And niggas just dissin'
Now I went big time, I got 'em all ass kissin' 
I roll in the Benzo, sittin' on Lorenzos
Now the same record company's at my window 
I guess they wanna talk, talk about what 
Heh, makin' me a star 
Well you gotta pay me
Cause to the Underground alone I done sold hella tapes 
Thanks to my hookup, my concerts are booked up 
The same companies mad they over-looked us 
Thick ass contracts to get a nigga stuck 
And then my lawyer say you ain't legit, I gotta shoot you up
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up 
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 
Shoot them mother fuckas up
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up 
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 
Shoot 
Shoot them mother fuckas up
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot the mother fuckas 
Shoot the mother fuckas up
  
[Master P]
So I refuse to get paid like them other dummies 
Sellin' hella tapes and ain't makin' no money
You see I gotta fuck 'em up
I started my own company, that's how a nigga fuckin' came up
Lookin' for district bitches 
But like my homie SKI it ain't nothin' but prostitution 
So I refuse to get fucked like a hoe 
That's why a nigga make shit for the god damn streets bro
Now the underground I rule 
Success came fast but I done paid hella dues 
Alot of rappers try ????, like sayin' they in jail, to make they tapes sell
Or poppin' that nasty shit 
Show some pussy on the cover, and talk about eatin' a bitch 
But I can never just stunt
I make that hard-core shit that niggas wanna pump
I'm puttin' hits on niggas in the rap game 
I'm takin' 'em out just like the fuckin' dope game
You run up on P pump your pressin' your luck
I pack a nine cause I just might shoot a nigga up 
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 
Shoot the mother fuckas up 
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up 
Shoot 
Shoot the mother fuckas up 
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Yo P, what
Shoot them mother fuckas up
  
[Master P]
Yeah niggas you better break your mother fuckin' selves
You know what i'm sayin' 
Cause Master P is comin' straight gangsta hard-core 
With this Underground shit for the nine-two 
You know what i'm sayin', we shootin' niggas up this year
I got my partner Calli G close to me 
Silkk, C-Murder, Fonzo, Sonya C, SKI, and CMT in the mother fuckin' house 
With this laid-back ass dope track 
Check this out, we straight killin' mother fuckas this year
So you can take it how you want to you know what i'm sayin' 
You better run bitch!</pre>
