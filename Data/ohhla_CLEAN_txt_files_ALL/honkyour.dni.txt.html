[Missy]
Yeah, this is 2000 eternity
And this is for my cadillac grill low riders
Oh, if you got the escalator
Any fly real shit, that you think is sick
Blow your horns for me baby
Oh, boy

[Dani]
Oh boy, what's your name
And where did you get that escalade
Damn I love the way you sit
On 23's it's really sick
Yo, can I catch a ride
Do you mind if I bounce up in ya truck
Ooh, I'm bout to lose my cool
Have you ever seen a volcano erupt

[Dani] (Missy)
Truck on 20's and the rims is spinnin'
Everybody get with it (honk your horn), get with it
If your windows is tinted and your truck smells scented
And you bout to get lifted (honk your horn), get lifted
If you lookin' real fresh in your bird-bird ?
Got money and ? (honk your horn)
If your cadillac truck look like a million bucks
(Yo, people what's up, honk your horn, uh oh boy)

[Dani] (Missy)
Oh boy, excuse my French (uh)
But damn your truck is the shit (shit)
I go with the flow (whoo)
Ooh you're irresistible (uh)
Yeah, can I drive your car (uh)
And I'm gon' take it very far (ooh)
Ooh, you and me a team (aha)
Like afros and all the sheen (uh)

[Dani] (Missy)
Truck on 20's and the rims is spinnin'
Everybody get with it (honk your horn), get with it
If your windows is tinted and your truck smells scented
And you bout to get lifted (honk your horn), get lifted
If you lookin' real fresh in your bird-bird ?
Got money and ? (honk your horn)
If your cadillac truck look like a million bucks
(Yo, people what's up, honk your horn, whoo)

[Dani] (Missy)
So (so) hot (hot)
Rims (rims) shine (shine)
Mad (mad) props (props)
Seats (seats) recline (recline)
So (so) hot (hot)
Rims (rims) shine (shine)
Mad (mad) props (props)
Seats (seats) recline

[Missy] (Dani)
My rims keep shinin' like a flawless diamond
Everytime I put my 'Llac on the roll (roll)
You need to stop spyin' on my see-through diamond
Make you think I just had to rob a toe
Move from the truth, knock the chimney off the roof
Gotcha comin' out ya booth so my (my my my my my my)
Bir-birdy suits keep Missy looking cute
But I keep a close eye on ya guy, uh
