[Master P]
This for my nigga Young Bleed, ya heard me?
Young Bleed, hah hah, ungh
From the South to the West bring the noise
(Bitch I see you there, whas happenin?
 Oh what you don't remember me?  I'ma come out motherfucker, know how I do)
Ain't No Limit, unggggh

Ungggggh, bring the noise, nigga
Ungggggh, pass me them toys, nigga
(repeat 2X)

[Mystikal]
You need a fuckin whole army if you think you gonna take me
I come up in this bitch and start goin CRAZY
No more Mr. Nice Guy, excuses be given but that's how you MADE me
Bitch this real life, it ain'ts to be played with
One false move, niggaz I tear purchasin the pavement
Had to get my shit together straight never flyin right from a sandpit
Had to get my foundation mo' stable, and tighten up on my PAPER
Uncle Sam get out the way I don't care so hand the number
to my pager watchin for weasels, but still take good care of my PEOPLE
Keep handlin my business I'm in it to win it -- YEAH!
Fuck the party I'm workin hard from seargeant to lieutenant
Let's get it started to fin' it, my beginning is your ending
If I want it I GET IT, AND IF I SAID IT I MEANT IT
HOW IN THE FUCK you gonna PLAY ME, smile in my face like you LIKE me
Bitch you might as well HATE ME, you don't value my LIFE
Determination, balls of fate, is how I got up in here
So don't get SHOT up in here get out the way bitch we GOT IT from here!

Chorus: Master P

So, bring the noise, niggaz unnnngh
So, pass me them toys, nigga unngggggh
(repeat 2X)

Niggaz duck when I came I mean I buck and they ran
How many fools screamin Soldier but they couldn't maintain
I had my Soldier ranks high and across my fo'head
Is there a heaven 4 a gangsta, that what my pah said
I learned to, double it up for some dollars
Hooked up wit a dopefiend term I sawed shit into hard powder
I'm on the block slangin amphetamines
I'm thinkin about my ghetto dreams on a triple beam
Ain't no, turnin back I'm way too deep
I got prices on my head by niggaz in the hood and the police
A young nigga tryin to make it
Twenty inch rims, candy wood, that's why they hate me, Soldiers

Chorus

[Young Bleed]
Nigga if you ain't ready now you won't ever be ready
They tryin to catch me for steady stackin confedi it's heavy
But let me explain the game to break the chains of pain and, misery
Playin my fame throughout this game and, remain a, mystery
Is you peepin my skill?  Is you seein is it real?
Is you hurtin from hatin makin me reach for my steel?
Knowin I'm runnin with ballers and steady clickin with killers
Graveyard peelers masterminded drug dealers, and bitches love
niggaz payin dues without nothin to lose
Actin a fool the savage style from New Orleans to Baton Rouge
I'm the cool out, makin it pop, it don't stop
til I stack a million chips that's off the top, is you feelin me?
I'm willin, it ain't no killin, I bet
your life'll never be the same from blood spillin
Heavens to Merkatroid gotta be fouler like the Big Boy
Shakin up some shit I thought you knew I bring the noise, bitch

Chorus

[Master P]
Ha ha, No Limit nigga
Bringin the motherfuckin noise
Young Bleed, pass the toys
Mystikal, and I got it Master P
Let's ride out nigga, handle our business
Burst the game on these stupid bitches and get paid
