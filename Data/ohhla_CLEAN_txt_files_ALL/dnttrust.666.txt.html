What what x10

(Chorus) x4
My nigga told me once don't you trust them motherfuckers
They act like they your thugs but they phoney motherfuckers

You trust no you trust no fucking bitch
Cuz if you trust a fucking bitch you be in the ditch
Oh no you let a hoe
Set you up and now its time to let these hoes know its go
You kick in'z they door you lay them on the floor
You put the gun to they motherfucking forehead bro
Is it fucking come
Is it fucking go
I kill a hoe like I kill a fucking nigga bro
I thought you fucking knew you fucking with the six
You fuck with us we put your body in a fucking ditch
Bitch you done fucked around with the clique
Click A motherfuckers gun sound bitch
We don't trust no hoe
We don't trust no man
We got our own fucking thing don't you understand
Now how the fuck the hoes think they taken something
You take nothing you only taken the fucking drama

Chorus

How could you betray your folk
Haters like you should be smoked
Killed wrapped in plastic body bags cuz your ?
Trick we coming after ya
Death is looking drastical
Strapped up spectacular
Then suck blood like dracula
Best make sure you haven't said
Never hide the evidence
Use to be my nigga now I'm rampaging your residence
Pay my dues down the juice
Stealing what ?
Cuz you ? back in middle school
What happened to blazing bags
Hanging out and skipping class
Now you in the ? position bitch you wanna blast
Hating us supieror
Murder your ass now meeting the criteria
Ain't no use in being shamed
Blood on your mirror frame
And that was provided from my ? a nigga to the brain
I'm deranged born crazed
Shimmey to the turning lane
Couldn't drop this nigga so I took his ass to the game

Chorus

Ash to ash
Dust to dust
How many motherfuckers that I can't trust
I can't trust suckers
I can't trust suckers
And I sure can't trust that nigga that be riding in that back trunk
And I can't trust my gal
Cuz my gal she snitch
And I can't trust that bitch
Cuz a bitch is a bitch
And I can't trust that nigga that I use to hang with
Cuz that nigga I use to hang with he'll flow like a bitch
And I can't trust chuck
Cuz chuck hear what
Have me walking round here singing shookey like dookey
And I can't trust my ?
Bust out my window and I ?
All over my car
nigga you know who I am
Rat tat tat is my level
Pushing bodies in bags
Bodies in bag and have your ass walking the procession
Fuck with me my nigga putting bodies in bag
