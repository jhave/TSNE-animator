I do not talk - I AM JUST A RAPPER

[Childish Gambino]
Motherfuck a nigga~! Hell yeah I do it bigger
I got eight figures like I'm skatin in the winter
Niggaz thought that I was kiddin, these raps are not my sketches
I'm a +Sick Boy+ nigga, when I cough I hope you catch it
My germs in your system, now you coughin like asthmatic
All of my "I'm tired of it" turns into your "Wish I had it"
I don't need this money, but I spend it like I wanna
She said this dick is hers, I don't wanna take it from her
Your - dick stay chilly, it's a cold rough world
I get superhero pussy, she a PowerPuff Girl
Shit just got real like Pinocchio turds
And yo' nigga is Giupetto, I don't want no instrumentals
Leave the vocals on my shit, like the song givin me head
And your bitch can't sleep, cause she used to my bed
She could have any dick, you just mad she chosen mine
Schoolin all you niggaz and my mouth will make it Columbine
I AM JUST A RAPPER man, I ain't got no clothing line
My clothing line has closed the line and let me shop at closing time
Yo boy got stacks, like I'm standin in a Borders line
Hidin from you bitches cause, real niggaz hard to find
Work this shit like overtime; yeah my clothes are so designed
Closet look like Bloomingdales, yo' closet look like fashion jail
I break you out, I post for bail, this money make me Olsen Twins
You call your bitch, you hearin this, uh-uh-uh
Yes it's necessary to be flyer than canaries
Stay fresh to death like a mint cemetery
I do not talk, yeah my life a library
Eat her out and leave her cold, make that hoe my Ben &amp; Jerry's
Broke the mold on you bitches man, I am so unique
You are NOT A RAPPER, if you were you'd hardly speak
I am Stone Mountain and I haven't reached my peak
Fuck her like I'm mad at her then I turn the other cheek
This shit is amazin; check me in my sweater man
Comme des GarÃ§ons, bitch, nobody do it better man
But I do it better man, when it comes to pussy
girls whisper in my ear "No one else can do this to me"
Youse a cutie but you gotta know I'm married to my work
And these niggaz ain't shit - so I guess they must be urine
Gotta gift this, bitch; like Christmas, bitch
I'ma rap and act, Will Smith this bitch
When rappers start rappin over indie shit
Just remember I was first to, hit this shit
The difference is, I'm different, bitch
How the fuck can these niggaz be dickless pricks?
Man, what the fuck you gon' do? I don't need to talk to you
I AM JUST A RAPPER 2... I AM JUST A RAPPER 2</pre>
