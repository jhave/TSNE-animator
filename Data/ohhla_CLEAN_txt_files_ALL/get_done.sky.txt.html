"And yes y'all"
 
[Verse One] [Skyzoo]
The dude with the fitted to the left is right back at it
I ain't lost a step
Respect is through the ceilin', I ain't lost a rep
I ran a hundred laps and I ain't lost a breath
So fuck whoever's next
Youngin' I'm the moment at hand
And may God help you 
Or you gonna get to know that man
Son I'm past what your aim is
Fuck around and try to get famous 
And you'll be slap boxin' the stainless
Naw, that ain't tough talk
Dude it's live
I'm from the block where the king was movin' 2 for 5's
So in the legacy of B.I.G., I'm on my B.I. lean
I treat beats like P.Y.T.s, I slut 'em
S-K, the bottom of the ninth is mine 
In blue and white pinstripe designs
And when my pen drips
I'm on my win shit
I Draino your career, you hear that drip drip
I clear it out
 
[Scratch chorus] [x2]
"So keep that okey doke shit cause I don't fall for it"
"Ignite the mic and let it strike my opponent" - Akrobatik 'A To The K'
"Do it now, get it done"
"If I don't hold it done for mine, I ain't no G"
 
[Verse Two] [Torae]
Yo, I came for a lot of shit talkin' and kid sparkin' is awesome
I treat Walkmen's like skip buttons is off 'em
Hit the rewind when I'm spit talkin' so often
My intro the only shit I been performin'
The swag out of this world
The flow is ridiculous
It's me Sky and Preem, we sicker than syphilis
And you outta your mind to think you can get with this
The boy body the booth and bury the witnesses
But bare witness to lyrical giftedness
Nigga this the difference
What you been missin' is
A new breed of the raw
My ingredient is pure, a nutritional break down of the boy
Will show traces of the wildest parts of Shakur
I've been a Mic Fiend since Ra walked in the door
But now they changed the locks and fucked up the entrance
Till me and Sky blow the shit off the hinges
 
[Scratch chorus]
"So keep that okey doke shit cause I don't fall for it"
"Ignite the mic and let it strike my opponent" - Akrobatik 'A To The K'
"Do it now"
"Get it done"
"If I don't hold it done for mine, I ain't a G"
 
[Verse Three] [Skyzoo]
I'm in a +New York State Of Mind+ when I +Kick In The Door+
With +A Million And One Questions+ when I'm +Bring(ing) It On+
So whether +Friend Or Foe+, it's doe I need
Now +Recognize+ or You gonna get to Know My Steez
I'm +So Ghetto+
I +Represent+ the back of the field
But I'm overflowin' with +Mass Appeal+
I'm like +Royalty+, +Just To Get A Rep+
I'm on my own dick
It's like '95 all over again

[Torae]
It's reminiscent of Nas or Jay, Billy or Womack
Another classic collab, we feel like a throwback 
NYG'z always know where the doe at
I use my Termanology to find where these hoes at
A true Poet and I'm wise as a Guru
Cause when you Teflon, ain't no stickin' it to you
I'm Nice as Smooth
Calm as dead waters
I like D&amp;D but love it as Headquarterz
Rest in peace
