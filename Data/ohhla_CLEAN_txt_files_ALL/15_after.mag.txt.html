Ooh, it's it's so funky (yes it is)
It's it's so funky (15 after da hour baby)
Ooh, it's it's so funky (something always happens)
It's it's so funky 
Ooh, it's it's so funky (it's oh so funky)
It's it's so funky  (check it out)
Ooh, it's it's so funky (Maganoo and Timbaland, check it out in stores)

Timbaland:

It's about 5:15 got a call from Weezie West
Timbaland you have a check on my desk
You must pick it up by 7
Or you'll have to pick it up by 11
Wait a minute I got a meeting at 6
I can't pick it up by 7-ish
Therefore I must pick wait until tomorrow
Go to my man and ask if I can borrow
200 or 100 chips
If I get them then I dip
Now it's about 9:15
Got a page from my girl Misdemean
Timbaland I need you to meet me out in Queens
While you on your way don't forgetto bring
My sunglasses and my show-jack
Don't forget da gat and the cigarettes
It's about 10:15
Call on my cell it's this fine beauty queen
Timbaland make my body hot, make it steam
Shit, it's 11:15
Got another call from another beauty queen
But I can't hit, got to see Misdemean
Here I am out in the middle of Queens
Damn near about 1:15
Now I'm leaving Queens about 3:15
Hopin I can hit one of my queens
So I hit about 7:15
Then I finish at 9:15
Tell her to wake me up at 10:15
But she wakes me up at 11:15
Know what I mean I'm late for weezie
15 after da hour, it's kinda cheezie

Magoo:

Early in the morn, 8:15
Jump in the tub, rub-a-dub, get clean
Rap the listine I got from Misdemean
9:15 dressed in all green
Dip to the parking lot
Look what I got
10:15 meet Tim at the spot
We can make it hot
Cook it in the pot
11:15 feed the hoe while it's hot
1:15 got to get rubbers
Me and Lisa Lee later on beat lovers
2:15 we like sex in the mist
3:15 was the first time we kissed
Girl your man aint shit and you know it
4:15 is the time I can show it
When I say suck it, it don't mean blow it
5:15 get loot cause you broke it
Girl it aint a blunt, so dont smoke it
Better if you grab it with your hand then you choke it
6:15, aint my day quick?
VCR tape, halloween is the flick
Drinking like a cellar, pass out drunk
7:15 had a dream I was a monk

Timbaland:

15 after da hour everything seems to go bad you say dag
15 after da hour booty calls get lost in the sauce, what's the cost?
15 after da hour, 15's a bad number know what I mean?
15 after da hour, 15, 15
Say what?</pre>
