Song:   Livin it Up
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

One, two..
One (two) one one one (two) one, one, one
One two (test two, two)
One.. testin, testin mic..
Turn that mic up (turn the mic UP)

Aiyyo, Phar-oahe Monch-is, in-cred, i-ble
Ridiculous pivoting fit meticulous splitting shits
in half, cause my, words make, earthquakes
Soliciting intricately impossible obstacles hit
you-in-your-ugly-fuckin-face man
Defendin em even when I'm a minimum state of
mind cause, my rhymes, shine like, diamonds
World circuit, work it, perfect, timing

Ay-yadi-yadi-yadi-yay (hey yo we livin it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yo (hey yo we livin it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yay (that's right we livin it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yo (c'mon we livin it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yay (that's right we livin it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yo (c'mon we livin it up)
Ya-di-ya-di-ya-di-ya-di-yiiiiii (we livin it up, we livin it up)
(we livin it up, we livin it up)

Heyyyy, bump this shit in your new car system
The pinnacle of sinister the cynical wisdom
My strategy, split em, seemingly hitting em
with little eenie meenie bits of flattery
That'll stagger em for a minute, imagine I'm draggin em in it
The mud, "Fudge Pudge" rememebr I'm braggin infinite
This Menace here II finish off Society
Not Dennis, the nemesis of a different variety
The gap-toothed kid with the ill computer flow (uhh)
The Most Beautifullest Thing, so suitable

Ay-yadi-yadi-yadi-yay (hey yo we livin it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yo (hey yo we livin it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yay (hey yo we livin it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yo (shhh.. we livin it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yay (hey yo we livin it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yo (that's right we livin it up)
Ya-di-ya-di-ya-di-ya-di-yiiiiii (we livin it up, we livin it up)
(we livin it up, we livin it up)

Yo, come get that ass kicked fast quick
Monch already with an asterik
Blast past MC's faster than Flash did
At last a cop checked to cop hash wit
Dash a little bit in the cake mix to get blasted
Sacred, scriptures written inscripted scribe my scrupils
Slap unhappy MC's who become my pupils
You're tossed, cut off, similar to cuticles
The Most Beautifullest Thing, so suitable

Yadi-yadi-yadi-yay (yo, we livened it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yo (that's right, we livened it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yay (we livened it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yo (we livened it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yay  (shhh... we livin it up)
Yadi-yadi-yadi-yo (that's right we livin it up)
Ya-di-ya-di-ya-di-ya-di-yiiiiii (we livin it up, we livin it up)
(we livin it up, we livin it up)

Yeah!</pre>
