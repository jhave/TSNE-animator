[Intro: 50 Cent]
Nigga we not playin!
Zero tolerance for that fake shit get shot playin!
That's how we on it
Yeah it's rap 'til we start sprayin!
When you see the nozzle on that K you should start prayin!
That's how we on it!

[Chorus: Rell] (50 Cent) 
I don't wanna waste time talkin to fellas
Who run up on me talkin that bullshit
Instead I let them talk when my goons get hellish
The only way they talk is with a full clip
You 'gon make them boys dump, you 'gon make them boys slump 
(Chump I throw up the semi on a nigga yeah!!!)
You 'gon make them boys dump, leave you and your man slump
You 'gon make them boys dump, show them with the right one
(Chump I throw up the semi on a nigga yeah!!!)
You 'gon make them boys dump, it's like that for real, it's like that for real

[Verse One: Jadakiss]
Yeah shorty wild, tre pounds, forty cals
At the dice game with brand new hundreds forty thou'
Stay fly work out, all we eat is Halal
You'll never catch 'em dirty 'cause all they keep is a smile
When they caught 'em with a gat in the car you beat it in trial
He don't say too much, never eager to style
Remind me of Gotti, Shyne with the shotties
Lawyer so good paid a fine for a body
Heroin and B-more, crib by the seashore
Car service to the G4 Fila Velour
Piff rolled in the dutch or the Cuban cigar
Tryin to expand the brand so he could see more
Everybody love him from the Crips to the B-dogs
Leave niggas for dead, let 'em have a bleed off
Four-four to the head, will tear a nigga meat off
And he don't show no emotions when he lettin that heat off

[Chorus: Rell] (50 Cent)
I don't wanna waste time talkin to fellas
Who run up on me talkin that bullshit
Instead I let them talk when my goons get hellish
The only way they talk is with a full clip
You 'gon make them boys dump, you 'gon make them boys slump 
(Chump I throw up the semi on a nigga yeah!!!)
You 'gon make them boys dump, leave you and your man slump
You 'gon make them boys dump, show them with the right one
(Chump I throw up the semi on a nigga yeah!!!)
You 'gon make them boys dump, it's like that for real, it's like that for real

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Yeah, yeah
My nickname change, call me Trey when I'm snubbin 'em (yeah)
Billy when I'm clubbin 'em, Box when I'm cuttin 'em
Niggaz dyin, I ain't prayin, I don't even fuck with 'em
Card game shuffle; hundred grand in the duffle (woo!)
Blackjack, poker, pinochle - you win, fuck you
Niggaz tryin to lie on me, they sayin I'm grimy (yeah)
Fo' hundred mil' and I still can't chill (fuck that!)
Call me G, double barrel, N - GOON!
Boom! I do it like a 'Natti nigga do (what's up?)
New York City's pharaoh, potato on the barrel
Shell-case muffle, make me come touch you
I finger-fuck my firearm, we intimate, I'm into it

[Chorus: Rell] (50 Cent)
I don't wanna waste time talkin to fellas
Who run up on me talkin that bullshit
Instead I let them talk when my goons get hellish
The only way they talk is with a full clip
You 'gon make them boys dump, you 'gon make them boys slump 
(Chump I throw up the semi on a nigga yeah!!!)
You 'gon make them boys dump, leave you and your man slump
You 'gon make them boys dump, show them with the right one
(Chump I throw up the semi on a nigga yeah!!!)
You 'gon make them boys dump, it's like that for real, it's like that for real

[Verse Three: Jadakiss]
Yo, yeah...
If you hit 'em in the head with the dummies, then you good
Funeral homes make the most money in the hood (Uh)
Either usin the chrome, pearl handles or the wood
Animals tryin to get away with whatever they could
It's spooky, how you could get rich off ?loosies?
Four stacks for the jacket, sneaks cost a deuce-y
You see the five stars, I'm a general, salute me
They want a nigga to disappear, they tryna poof me
I'm just in the crib countin gwap, up all night 
I got a new crew, DOS - Dump On Sight
I be in and out of the country I jump off flights
Four-fifth is room temperature, the pumps on ice (Ice)
Handle shit accordingly, whenever it comes to you
Do the right thing or the get the right thing done to you
Whatever you do, I just hope you got a gun with you
The +Tommy+ is like a live band when the +drum+ hits you
DUMP!

[Chorus: Rell] (50 Cent) 
I don't wanna waste time talkin to fellas
Who run up on me talkin that bullshit
Instead I let them talk when my goons get hellish
The only way they talk is with a full clip
You 'gon make them boys dump, you 'gon make them boys slump 
(Chump I throw up the semi on a nigga yeah!!!)
You 'gon make them boys dump, leave you and your man slump
You 'gon make them boys dump, show them with the right one
(Chump I throw up the semi on a nigga yeah!!!)
You 'gon make them boys dump, it's like that for real, it's like that for real

[Outro: 50 Cent]
