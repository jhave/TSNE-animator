It's not about the money

[chorus]2x
You see its not the [money] (5x)
You say it aint about the [lovin] (5x)
You be on the alone its [nuthin] (5x)
If its not nuthin
Girl its gotta be somethin
Slippin fallin slippin 
You must really love me

[Lil' Zane]
Told so many lies 
By so many different guys
Its hard to see the truth when in front of your eyes
I'm from a city of conflicts
Criminals and convicts
Livin on the run baby 
Only havin fun baby
She was just a friend so I never dug her
A young thug and so it wasn't in my heart to love her
You say you love me regardless 
You was young and I was heartless
We both said it
I was hard headed
Everything you said went into a ear and out another
I couldn't understand you wanted me to be your lover
You took time every night to write me love letters
And you used to whisper in my ear nobody does it better
And did I mention it was long letters
I like they way you squeeze in them dungaries
But the thongs betta
And you believe that I'm not there
Till it make it feel like if you leave then I won't care
Yeah

[chorus]

[Lil' Zane]
All my life I been goin through depression
More of the love and less dressin
I'm tired of guessin
Tell me if you want affection
You make a thug feel love
You head rushin
And I can't seem to get enough 
Can I touch somethin?
You're like an angle wit some wings sent to guide me
The law try to lock me down but you hide me
Be beside me strapped for war soldier guide me
I'm tryin to be wit you 
Aint a army that can stop me
Told me team the dream and automatically they knock me
Said ya beat me down cause I'm young I'm like "watch me"
I love winnin, ice linen and keep my dubbs spinnin 
Love women, street corners and I'm gone keep on bendin
Wit you its no pretendin 
And even at the beginin I knew that you was wit it
Even tho I neva hit it
Forgive me for the times I bullshitted
And now I'm all yours
Baby you did it

[chorus]4x</pre>
