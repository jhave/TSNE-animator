[Hammer]
B-boys yo I'm so upset
Break it down hard for the West respect
Bite yo' tongue, but don't you run
The fight ain't over it's just begun
Listen real close I'll get you straight
This is no La-Di-Da-Di or a radio break
Grab yo' speakers, a paper, a pen
And pay close attention because the West is in
Servin this notice and you better take notes
The West is down and we ain't no joke
West coast b-boys on the rise
Hammer and the posse cold kickin it live
Breakin down beats, MC's I devour
Rockin on the mic and you're feelin my power

(Oooh) Yeah, like I knew you should
Yeahhh

[Hammer]
Power is the key and you know what it gets
I come to see your show, that's how you make yo' check
Head so big, give us respect
Y'all talk a lot of stuff sucker boy we legit
Voice like go boom and you know you're doomed
if you try to diss the West when the Hammer's in the room
When the story is told, you act so bold
Leap like a frog if you think you're bold
I chew you like gum, and spit you out
You're nuttin but a fish, a smelt and not a trout
Fish boy liver when you see me you shiver
You talk a lot of whack, MC Hammer, I deliver
Breakin down beats, MC's I devour
Rockin on the mic and you're feelin my power

Yeahhh! Like a nuclear shower
(Oooh) Yeah, West

[Hammer]
Where would you go if you really didn't know
I was chillin at your show sittin in the front row
Me and my posse, posse yell HO
Rockin on the mic just to let you know
No denyin on what you've been tryin
The West ain't dead, yo' raps are dyin
All yo' beats they all sound the same
If yo' name was Joe would his be the same?
B-boy rocker, a real show stopper
Sippin on soda don't drink no vodka
In effect now boy, we in effect
You talk that whack, we want respect
Breakin down beats, MC's I devour
Rockin on the mic and you're feelin my power

(Oooh) Yeahhh! Like a nuclear shower
Yeahhh

[Hammer]
A-B-C-D-E-F-G
I'm not impressed, can you count to 3?
1-2-3 I won't give you hell
Y'all talk a lot of whack yep boy go yell
Don't be a fool, and don't quit school
I rock on the mic and the {?} tool
I'm a real showstopper on a mission to prove
You got an education you're on the move
I stayed in class with a pen and pad
I rock on the mic and I'm no jackass
In effect boy and I dare you to try
The West is def and we won't be denied
Breakin down beats, MC's I devour
Rockin on the mic and you're feelin my power

(Oooh) Yeahhh! Like a nuclear shower
Yeahhh... {*fades*}</pre>
