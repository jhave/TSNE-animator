I'm that classy mami with the Marilyn Monroe body (hahaha)

Ghetto fabolous, glamourous, its effortless
Make up light, we with my pastel Luis
Designer scarf, work of art, rockin' vintage Gucci

[Chorus 2x: Beyonce]
You can find me in da club, sippin' on some bub
Daddy I got what you need you's a sexy little thug
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin for no love
So come give me a hug, you a sexy little thug

My nails, my hair, my diamond rings
Shining with all my fancy things
My crib, my car, my clothes, my jewels
Why you mad, cause I came up and I ain't changed

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I'm that girl wearing Chanel pearls
Chandeliers in my ears from ???
Ya feelin' my style, ya feelin' my flow
Hair sheek, smells sweet, like flow to flow
I'm the lady sippin' Bailey's while I strut like a model
If the ladies wanna hate me, I just send them a bottle
I know I got it, but don't flaunt it even though brothas want it
Dancin' dirty while I'm flirtin', cause he checkin' up on me

[Chorus 2x: Beyonce]
You can find me in da club, sippin' on some bub
Daddy I got what you need, you a sexy little thug
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin for no love
So come give me a hug, you a sexy little thug

   Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

My nails, my hair, my diamond rings
Shining with all my fancy things
My crib, my car, my clothes, my jewels
Why you mad, cause I came up and I ain't changed

(* Beyonce in the background *)
   Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh!

-------------------------------------------------------------
And you should love it, way more than you hate it
Oh, you mad, I thought you should be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
Move out the hood now you tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my junk get to pumpin' in da club it's on
I wink my eye at ya chick, if she smile, she gone
If the roof on fire, man, just let it burn
If you talkin' about money, homie I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me, cuz go head, switch the style up
And if they hate, then let 'em hate, and watch the money pile up
Or we go upside they head with a bottle of bub
C'mon, ain't know where we be..

[Chorus 2x: Beyonce]
You can find me in da club, sippin' on some bub
Daddy I got what you need, you a sexy little thug
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin for no love
So come give me a hug, you a sexy little thug

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Hahaha
Don't try to act like you don't know where we been either
We in da club all the time, it's about to pop off
Hahaha</pre>
