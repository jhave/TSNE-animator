[Chorus: Chevy Jones] (Pooh)
This here is something special
And I don't wanna let it go
Makes me feeeeel, like I'm sitting on top of the world
And I love it (Yeah, yeah, I got you sayin)
And I love it (Yeah, yeah, I got you sayin)
And I love it (Yeah, yeah, I got you sayin)
And I love it (What you sayin?) and I love it

[Dae One]
I can give you what you need right, everything you need like
Cut the camera on, we gon' make a sex scene tonight
Kissin and touchin, lickin and suckin
All of the above, see tonight you gon' be buzzin
multiples, that's how it's s'posed to go, with me inside
Got you feelin so alive, with this feeling you describe
as incredible, eat you like a vegetable
Food for my soul and I know I won't let you go
Cause I know I need that, and I know you need this
See I'm on some cocky shit, but I know you believe this, don't cha?
So don't be actin shy now like you don't want it
It's like a rollercoaster, come and take a ride on it
Givin you that sensation that's so intense
And when I'm gone, it's the feeling you gon' miss
I'm knowin what you need, you ready to receive
She look me in my eyes said, "Daddy, give it to me"
It's so special

[Chorus]

[Noni Spitz]
You love the way I do it, I make you feel amazing
My sex situation keeps the legs shakin, and girrr-rl
You know how I like it, when you in that night shit
I work you like a night shift, so girrr-rl
Lay back and enjoy the experience
And understand that thse other dudes ain't relevant
It's pure satisfaction when in action
I'm Houdini with the magic, flippin ya matress
The best you ever had, you cain't live without it
And even when I'm gone, you wet just thinkin about it
Hopin that I'm comin back soon
to let the animal out and make the jungle out the bedroom
I don't worry 'bout me, I do what you need
And maybe that's the reason you addicted to me
A habit that you gotta keep, between the sheets
Lettin you know that it's alright to be a freak

[Chorus]

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I see you starin like, like you want some
You want that body tapped harder than a rock drum
You say your juicebox's tasty like a ripe plum
I say enough foreplay, let's get to havin fun
The bedroom - nah, I'm thinkin more like kitchen
Fruit bowls and whipped cream, I'ma skip the chicken
Big boy need a sample, finger lickin
You like it when I touch the kitty, purr goes the kitten
It was written all over your face
Ask you where you wanna be cause it's no better place
than right here witcha nigga, gettin all nasty
Lady in the street, between the sheets, fuck classy
We can make a movie so the moment never pass me
We can make a movie, run it back I would gladly
Repeat, every move that I executed
Heavyweight champion in bed, undisputed
It's special

[Chorus]</pre>
