You know what?
Everybody goes through some changes in life
Some poeple change for the better, some poeple change for the worse
But umm, some people need to make that change
You know what I mean? Change is good sometimes. You know?

[Verse 1]
Why would I change? I ain't never slide down a bad pole
Even though I'm certified over plat's sold
They say I'm different 'cuz I ride in a plat. Rolls
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?
I never snitch, and go and hide in a rat hole
And I aint givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold
No pride, I ain't that old
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm ?????
It probably don't seem like a struggle
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you
Is beggin'for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you
And goin through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?

[Chorus]
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you
If you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you

[Verse 2]
Why would I change? I didn't step out of Superman's phone booth
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth
I'm speakin' the known truth
I ain't been living the same, since I moved under Silvia Rone's roof
Why would I feel like I'm a stranger?
And why should I feel like I'm in danger?
And I'm grindin' 'till I'm right
Whether it's on the streets, or online tryna climb sites
I ain't blind from the limelite,
I had my mind and my rhymes right, and signed when the time's right
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my three eight full
I'm playin, the game, like I'm, supposed
Stayin, the same, like I'm, supposed
Ghetto Fab in da house, hip hop hustler
One million customers, and I still bust at ya

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks
Known a few ????? and met a few locs
Made a few comments, and said a few jokes
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then
Some have even became rivals instead of friends
Only two become liable for settlements
I grew up watchin the
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in
They know the family bring knives and barettas in
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd
How could my head be in the clouds?
It's strange, what the fame'll do
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you

[Chorus]

I'm the same nigga man
Same nigga, that ridin' with you
Niggas that's fuckin' with you
I'm still fuckin' with you niggas
The same nigga, these hoe's ain't like
Now they on my dick right? Haha... shit is crazy
Don't let this game change you nigga...</pre>
