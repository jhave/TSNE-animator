[Verse 1: Vanilla Ice]
Now here's a Zig Zag story while I'm writing this song
Sit back relax I'm igniting this bong
Picture this sandy beaches dimes wearin thongs
Serving mixed drinks to me all night long
With me feet back puffin on my weed sack
Shit you can't believe that people ask me
Where you buy your trees at
Got the Bombay Ganje lime green
Sticky icky Ganja got me needing Visine
Like a magic carpet ride come fly with me
And this is for my homies that get high with me
Just crack the Phillie open cause we keep on smoking
Dimes rubbin on lotion
Feet soaking in the ocean
On a tropical Island staying sunny
We outta Phillies take these skins somebody roll a Mummy
Now people say money makes the world go round
So come escape with me and let's puff on a  pound

[Chorus 2x]
So high fly through the sky
And ride my life high

[Verse 2: Uncredited Reggae Singer]
No matter what you say
Feeling so alright so Ire today
Fire de go blaze
No responsibility man
No responsible
Me I go rolling a fat blunt
Smoking the fat blunt
This is my goal
Take it easy Rastaman
I will now go blaze
From Kingston Jamaica
Bombay to India
Smoking in the air
What da da da day
Some of them are smoking
Weed to take away frustration
I and I do it for me aggravation
Dreadlock to Babylon are selling everyday
Come me say
Bringing it back on the boat back to the USA
With the ganja me floating me floating away
Why not come and puff with me and then we go fly away

[Chorus repeat]

[Verse 3: Vanilla Ice]
Well it's the sticky icky bomb Holmes
Got the fat sacks puffier than Sean Combs
It's the Ice man back blowin dookie out the nostrils
In the studio creating shit that's colossal
Apostle of the green bud see me bleemed up
In my 430 Lexus off in Texas teamed up
With the Darkman and we're blazing
Some headbanging shit yo the Ice'll come equipped
To spit with the best cause I'm all about mine
I got dimes of smoke that'll make you float on cloud nine
Then I shine just like a beacon in the night
Pass me the Thai I get high on the mic
For real a zig zag story for my peeps
Bangin in the Jeeps while you slang it in the streets
Like Napalm I'm way gone and now it's time to bounce
It's the weed song come with me and smoke an ounce

[Chorus repeat]</pre>
