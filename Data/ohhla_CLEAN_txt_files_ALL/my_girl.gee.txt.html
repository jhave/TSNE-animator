(My-my-my girl)

Well, let me tell you 'bout a girl who's finer than fine
She used to be somebody else's, now she's mine
All the fellas said, "Spoonie, don't mess with that"
But it's been a year, and I still go by to see her
It ain't the perfume, well, it's just her
She got the greatest respect for me
She calls me Mr. Gee
And I reply, so fella, hey
No need to try, so you might as well stay away
You spend your money on my girl winin dinin
You're never gettin her back, so ain't no sense in me lyin
To you, what I'ma do? Well, our star did not tell
I took her out one night and I rocked her well
Now she's my girl

Now she's my only girl and you know that's true
But personally it was the right thing to do
To her, cause she was so fine and I was so kind
That when I asked the young lady, she said she didn't mind
Doin what I want, as long as it felt good
Well, you know without a doubt I did the best I could
When I wanted to leave, she wouldn't let me out
For some unknown reason told her friends all about
Me, she even said I was the best she had
But it could not be, if you didn't treat her bad-
ly now you pretend that you love her so
Tell my friends that you want the girl back, but no
Way, gave her diamonds, I gave her pearls
And not to mention that I gave her my love
And that's why she's my girl

Now I'm the type of guy to make a girl feel good
And in return the young lady does the same, well should-
n't she? One hand washes the other, both wash the face
And as a matter of fact she's tas-
ty, keeps my feelin like I never did before
My favorite words to the girl is 'more
please', keeps me smilin, she keeps me feelin
Man, so good, if I was sick, she'd be my healin
My friend, my girl, soon to be my wife
And then she'll be mine for a life-
Time, for now she's my girl

Now sometimes we fuss, sometimes we fight
But we make everything alright before night-
time, no fussin, no time for fightin
There's plenty good lovin, she's so excitin
She's got me doin things that I never did
Like flushin that stuff like a little kid
But no bedtime stories like Jack &amp; Jill
Takes two to get a pail of water, be for real
If I climb any mountain, it'll be for fun
Not in order to get water, cause to me that's dumb
Without a stop I reach the top, and I won't fall down
Only to get busy if a girl's around
Now that I told you all about my girl
As you can see MC Spoonie Gee's the only one can do it
You say 'what?' well, I say satisfy
That pretty young lady, if you don't believe me try
It, with my girl</pre>
