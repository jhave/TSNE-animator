[ VERSE 1 ]
It's been so long and I paid my dues
And with rhymes like these, yo, Shan can't lose
You won't believe the strange thought that ocurred to me
So intense, it absolutely startled me
I knew that I was buggin when I stopped walkin:
"I think that you should hear me, I'm your conscience talkin
If you don't wanna listen, hey, it ain't no thing
You rap for a living, but you wish you could sing
You think your life is complete, there's a lot that you're missing
You enjoy making music for the people to listen
Hip-hop is your life, by oath you've sworn
Now it's time to start the mission for which you were born
You've acquired a rep, now you're labelled a villain
But I don't really care, Shan'll always be chillin
That's why I'm tryin to say, that's just part of your style
You were (born to be) wild, wild"
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)	--&gt; Steppenwolf

[ VERSE 2 ]
I couldn't forget, no matter how I tried
But my conscience just wouldn't let a day go by
All day long I watched and observed
No, I gotta be jokin, that's word to Herb
I can take a lickin and keep on smilin
Who needs a license to ill, I was born to be wildin
Rhymes sweeter than a premium vintage grape
&gt;From the paper I knew it'd sound dope on tape
Never in a rush, I'm Cold Chillin'
And the next perpetrator I find, I'm killin
Just ask your boys how many heads I flew
And that's why I roll with the Juice Crew
That voice in my mind taught me one lesson
I was born to be wild, and only suckers be fessin
I knew I had a purpose since the days of a child
I was (born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)

[ VERSE 3 ]
The meaning of 'wild' is not screaming and yelling
It's 'bout showing and proving and not showing and telling
All you counterfeit rappers, you might as well quit
You'll never hear me say I'm bad, bein wild is the shit
Rap symbol, and never been defeated yet
If rap is a crime, how much time I get?
The best impersonator couldn't copy my style
And even if he did, you know what I'd do, I'll -
As a matter of fact, it's what I already did
I pulled out a rhyme and cold blasted his lip
Most opponents get on, they're guilty as tried
They're diggin and stripped of whole manhood and pride
Don't be brave and save yourself half of the bill
You can't chop me with a saw cause your ass should chill
When they're slippin on the cuts I gracefully smile
Cause I was (born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)

[ VERSE 4 ]
Born to be wild, I'm takin command
While you're performin people screamin out: "We want Shan!"
I'm colder than ice and hot as a flame
And my rhymes are always clever, but they're never the same
What's wrong with your girl? Somebody ought to stop her
For bein in the presence of a low-life rapper
This rhymin was pressed as a special edition
I was born to be wild and you're the one on a mission
Allow me to say that I weaken resistance
Makin examples just to prove my mortal existence
Born to be wild means a prototype
And the roar of the crowd increases the hype
You have to be bold to try and steal my rhyme
Or even to dis cause you think that I'm
A sucker, a softie, or even a child
But I was (born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)
