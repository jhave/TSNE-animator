[Verse 1]
Check it out ah, ya, ya
From the moment we met, I was breathless
And not asbestos breathless either
Always, when you least expect it
Stumble across Rapunzel a Libra
Couldn't leave, I had to meet her
Greet the girl of my dreams with a kiss on the hand
What up? Little magnificent missing a man
Ran away, like kids to a van (Yeah!)
Gorgeous, walking on water
Sort of like Erin McNaught, but little shorter
Wore a Pandora, bought her a charm
Wasn't short of thought Äì bit of Paul on her arm
Calling for calm, we fought, made Iraq
And the border of Jordan a walk in the park
Jaws of a shark, too hard to break it off
Fall apart, so I would say:

[Chorus]
Rapunzel, gotta let your hair down
Girl, gotta let your hair down
I'm tired of fighting
We ain't going nowhere now

Gotta let your hair down
Girl, gotta let your hair down
Why we trying?
We ain't going nowhere now

[Verse 2]
And even she could see
Her love was like a demolition derby
I was Herbie, the love-bug, swerving
Cause I work on the road
She was like Russell the Crow
A jerk with her phone!
Know that I don't wanna fight Äì
Another night, chewing off my ear, like Mike
Another night ruined, I knew it
Knew you would do it
Scream when I'm out, like Hewitt
You were the one, you were the one that ran away
Like underlay, underlay
Then break it off, but come running back
Like baby, I want you back, but don't call me that
Now baby, baby
Baby, don't call me baby-baby
I said, baby-baby, don't call me baby
Baby-baby

[Chorus]
Gotta let your hair down
Girl, gotta let your hair down
I'm tired of fighting
We ain't going nowhere now

Gotta let your hair down
Girl, gotta let your hair down
Why we trying?
We ain't going nowhere now

[Verse 3]
Na, I'm just sick of you saying my friends are above you
You knew, when you were with me
But you were lost in watching Sex and the City
And what did you give me?
Your lips moving, but nothing coming out, like Britney!
And, what, did you lose it?
No, trust: every movement watched, like Truman
Only human, I ain't a saint, but don't cheat when I'm in the game
And still you know, you know no, you know you don't know me
Die from the photos I got, like Dodi
My own Naomi Campbell, I try to help, she fly off the handle:
No more candles, no more dinner, no more, I'm fat
I could look a little thinner
Where's my Cinderella, my little Bella?
Hard, but I had to tell her, so I'd say, yeah, so I'd say
I keep tellin' her, I keep tellin' her:

[Chorus]
Rapunzel, gotta let your hair down
Girl, gotta let your hair down
I'm tired of fighting
We ain't going nowhere now

Gotta let your hair down
Girl, gotta let your hair down
Why we trying?
We ain't going nowhere now
We ain't going nowhere now </pre>
