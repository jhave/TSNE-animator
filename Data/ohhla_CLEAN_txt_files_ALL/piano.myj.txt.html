(PSC):
2:40 in the afternoon...
In a blink you're here, the next second might decease
True destiny keeps my heart grounded, deceit encompasses masses
Unaware of the clashes with those who oversee
See my team so complete, known as Legendary
We rely on the cunning, common intelligence
Making sense of the running, chaos never ending
Stories, not pretending to feel it
You reveal it, meaning we see though you
Of course you beg to differ, but I am not the maker
The judge, the holy one, immortal music maker
AKA non faker of moves, PSC
Relayer of hard consciousness and the free
Unified through bass tones, microphones and tapes
Journeymen elevate life to the escape...escape...

Chorus:
My dear ones, tell me
Only time will tell, oooh time
Tell me...

(BFAP):
Every day's a different day, it's funny how time fades away
We play in underground caves making beats everyday
&gt;From my soul, Oakland, California, land of sun
Come through, control your destiny
What's to be of tomorrow if you never fight?
Recite to teach the young so they don't get sprung on the dumb
Teach each though speech on rhyme
Even though I'm a college drop out
Dropped out the sky from the moon
Hopin' to find who I am in this world
We're lost little boys and girls that're trapped perhaps
We shall all return to the black planet someday
And stop killing all our leaders
They're feeders of hate
I read a man from the ice in his eye
When you gotta walk away, never turn back and wonder why?
Cuz the light sets you free like Hong Kong wanting their shit back
Independence is the key if you ever wanna be able to live your life your way
Not their way, always keep what's inside
What's inside of you...

CHORUS

(PSC):
Believing in the inner force supports systems activated
The last dreams anticipated, find themselves, realize
Applications, true guys, sex, lies and groupies
Do these things matter or is life that shallow?
Internal battles...fight...fight...fight...fight....

CHORUS

(BFAP):
Living Legends of our time
These rhymes help you find magic in your soul
Beyond flow where do most emcee's go?
Do they know the power of a strong mind built through humble values?
I tell you, something's gotta change
Cuz pain inflicts anger
I was never a stranger in the day
Growing up in the mind doesn't happen for all
Time will tell on who shall fall
Time will tell if we learn to fight 
Time will tell if we all shall unite
Time will tell if we all see a black president
By then I'll be a resident on the white house lawn, with my painting shoes on
These songs shall live beyond time, in line with the future
Use your soul and spirit to capture within lyrics....

CHORUS

(BFAP):
Time never stops
Living Legends of our time
I think I drink too much, smoke too much</pre>
