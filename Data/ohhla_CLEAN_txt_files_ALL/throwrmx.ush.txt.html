Real talk. Usher, Just Blaze

[Usher]
Oh!
Oh ho!
(Mmm you gonna want me back)
(The last words she said to me now I'm wishing she was still here wit me)
(You know your gonna need me)
And now that day's here, ya man gotta shed tears
(Mmm you gonna want me back)

You never miss a good thing till it leaves ya
Finally I realized that I need ya
I want ya back
Baby girl I need ya back
Gotta have ya back, babe
Heartbroken when you left my world
Man I wish I woulda kept my girl
I love you
I don't know what I'm gon do without my baby

It's driving me crazy (It's driving me crazy)
'Cause I'm missing my baby (Missing my baby)
I'm goin' out of my mind and I'm runnin' out of time
Oh I just wish I could find you, girl
Said I'm about to go crazy (About to go crazy)
'Cause I been needin' you lately (Needing you lately)
I'm goin' outta my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now

Aww baby
What you say now?
(Your gonna want me back)
And still I want you, want you, want you, want you, want you
Need ya babe

If I could rewind the time
And get inside ya mind
I would take back all my words
I didn't see it, I couldn't see what I was doin' babe
See baby girl I was blind
And I wish that I could try
To be the man that you deserve
Give me one chance to make it work

It's driving me crazy (It's driving me crazy)
'Cause I'm missing my baby (Missing my baby)
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time
Oh I wish I could find you girl
Said I'm about to go crazy (About to go crazy)
'Cause I been needin' you lately (Needing you lately)
I'm goin' outta my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now

(Mmm you gonna want me back)
Wish I could throw it back
I want it the way it use to be
(Your gonna need me)
(Mmm your gonna want me back)
Give me chance to make it work!

It's driving me crazy (It's driving me crazy)
'Cause I'm missing my baby (Missing my baby)
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time
Oh I wish I could find you girl
Said I'm about to go crazy (About to go crazy)
'Cause I been needin' you lately (Needing you lately)
The love of my life but I wasn't loving you right baby

[Jadakiss]
I'm trynna stay strong I don't wanna crack
But I need her and she told me I'm gunna want her back
Shoulda believed her
Now I'm wishing I could throw me back
To the same spot where we found L-O-V-E at
Lose some then I lose again, when am I gunna win some?
I said alot of things out of anger, but I meant some
I brought alot of things to the table, besdies income
I just want things to go back how they use to be
I was use to you, and I thought you were use to me
Time was against us
You never miss something 'till it's gone
That's my word ma, you convinced me
It might not happen, but I'm still hopin
And my heart is broken, but the door is still open
Pillow still soakin
Dutch still lit, and a bottle still open
And if I don't get another chance
It might be hard to get focused

It's driving me crazy (It's driving me crazy)
'Cause I'm missing my baby (Missing my baby)
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time
Oh I wish I could find you girl
So I'm about to go crazy (About to go crazy)
'Cause I been needin' you lately (Needing you lately)
I'm goin' outta my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now

(Mmm your gonna want me back)
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here wit me
(Your gonna need me, need me one day)
And that day's here
(Mmm your gonna want me back)
And ya man gotta shed tears
I'm sittin' by the phone
Realizing she ain't ever coming home...</pre>
