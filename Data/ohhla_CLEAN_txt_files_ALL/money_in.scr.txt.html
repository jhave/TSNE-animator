[Young Buck]
Two step with me, let me show you how it goes
The Murciélago, lemme show you how it rolls
I got a Bentley that I only drove one time
50 bought it for me shorty but it's still mine
My Chevy clean and the paint look like lemon-lime
You wanna shine, it ain't hard, just get on your grind
We keep a bankroll, wallet full of credit cards
Cup full of Cristal, box full of cigars
Dirty South tatted on my back, I'm country
She said she like the way I talk, these hoes love me
Club goin crazy, we throwin out stacks
G-Unit South yeah, tell the DJ bring it back
See I'm A-Town stompin in a A-Town hat
But I'm reppin Tennessee, like my homey Project Pat
It ain't 'bout where you from homeboy it's where you at
Scrappy beat me on the dice, yeah it's cool I'll be back

Lil Jon, got me, 50, got me
I got a big-ass family, how you gon' stop me
Y'all niggaz, watch me, rise to the, top
My shit gon', sell, yo' shit gon', flop

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
