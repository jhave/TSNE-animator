[Lil Romeo talking]
Yo, I know we too young to be feelin' like this
We was ment for eachother
Fa real though

[Verse One- Lil Romeo]
Now you cryin' n weezin', now it's ok
You need to wash away them tears, cuz ya heart is safe
When ya not ok, just tell me baby
Cuz I'll fix it in a minute just for you my lady
Shorty just listen, pay attention
When I'm on the road, girl it's you that I'm missin'
Place to place from state to state
I ain't chingy, but I'm just one call away
And you know that I'm yurs each and everyday
And it don't matta what the haters say
But now you askin' me these question n thangs
I think it's time for a change
Let's just move onto bigger and better thangs
So, don't be insecur, when ya need me I'm gon be right thurr
See I ain't gon kanye west ya
cuz if it all falls down I'm gon be right wit ya

[Hook- Lil Romeo and girl]
I don't need nuthin' but you girl
I don't want nuthin' but you boy
I don't need nuthin' but you girl
I don't want nuthin' but you boy
I don't need nuthin' but you girl
I don't want nuthin' but you boy
I don't need nuthin' but you girl
I don't want nuthin' but you boy

[Verse Two- Lil Romeo]
I know you think I prolly got it all
Plenty money plenty fame and I'm nice with the basketball
But without a special girl in my life its hard
Cuz love is more important than jewlery and fancy cars
For you shorty, I trade it all
Just to make you smile mami, we could spend some time in the mall
If you want it girl then you can grab it, girl I ain't trippin'
Whatever you need baby, it ain't no limit
Get it?, So you should roll with this dude
Cuz you know I'm the one for you
Stay fresh to death, from my head to my shoes
Got everything I need shawty, all I'm missin' is you
You know the truth, if I had my way I would spend everyday around ya
If theres a problem you just holla, girl you know I got ya
It make me sad when I gotta go on the road without ya
I want ya I need ya, girl what else can I say about ya

[Hook- Lil Romeo and some chick]
I don't need nuthin' but you girl
I don't want nuthin' but you boy
I don't need nuthin' but you girl
I don't want nuthin' but you boy
I don't need nuthin' but you girl
I don't want nuthin' but you boy
I don't need nuthin' but you girl
I don't want nuthin' but you boy

[Verse Three- Lil Romeo]
I think about all the experiences that we had
And realise the good times a wait the bad
People wish that they could find sumthin' like we have
I couldnt wait to introduce you to my mom and dad
You keep me focused and away from all those playa hatas
When I'm down you pick me up, like an elevator
If ever we were apart, I don't think I could make it
You gave me your heart, I promise you I never break it
So wont you stick around for a while
I keep ya laughin' cuz ya know I like to see ya smile
To get to where ya are, you know I run a hundred miles
I love ya personality, not to mention ya style
Uh, so I just wanna know what it's gonna be
Baby girl you wanna roll with me
I pick you up from school, in a new black bentley gt
And we can ride, till they run outta streets
Ye, c'mon

[Hook- Lil Romeo and some chick]
I don't need nuthin' but you girl
I don't want nuthin' but you boy
I don't need nuthin' but you girl
I don't want nuthin' but you boy
I don't need nuthin' but you girl
I don't want nuthin' but you boy
I don't need nuthin' but you girl
I don't want nuthin' but you boy

I don't want nuthin' but you shawty
I gotta say whats up to Myke Diesel for makin' the beat
New no limit, ok</pre>
