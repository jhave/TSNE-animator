[Intro: Lil' Mama]
Chea! Uh huh
[It's poppin! (it's poppin) It's poppin! (It's poppin)]
Yeah...okay...
I gotta ask 'em...'cause if I don't...
[It's poppin! (it's poppin) It's poppin! (It's poppin)]
I dunno...Let's go!

[Chorus]
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin
I'm standin at my locker, and all the boys keep stoppin
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is poppin, my lip gloss is cool
All the boys keep jockin, they chase me after school

[Lil' Mama]
Mac (mac) L'Oreal, yep cause +I'm worth it+
Love the way, I puts it on so perfect
Wipe, the corners of my mouth so I work it
when I walk down the hallway they cain't say nothin
Oh!, Oh! Oh! My lips so luscious
The way I spice it up with the Mac-Mac brushes
L'Oreal got them wat-ballermelon crushes
That's probably the reason all these boys got crussssshESS...

[Chorus]

[Lil' Mama]
When it's, time for lunch, my lips still rock
Lil' Mama melon with da hot pink top
Cherry, vanilla, flavors is a virture
Dey, lovin! Lip gloss universal
The boys really like it, the girls don't speak
They - rollin they eyes, they lip gloss cheap
It ain't MY fault, but I could +up-graaade ya+
Show you how to use nice things with nice flaaaavas

[Chorus]

[Breakdown]
Cuz myyyyy lip glooooooooss - is poppin! (is poppin)
Is poppin! (Is poppin)
Cuz myyyyy lip glooooooooss - is poppin! (is poppin)
Is poppin! (Is poppin)

[Lil Mama]
Sittin in eighth period, thought I was in trouble
Dean called me on the loudspeaker on the double
I stepped in her office like "Yes Ms. McClarkson?"
She like, "Gurl, I ran out of my lip gloss and -
write down where you get yours from
Cuz I must admit, that bubblegum
is poppin! (is poppin)
Is poppin!" She ain't frontin..

[Lil' Mama croons]
N-uh, I be lovin it, I be I be lovin it n-uh
I be usin it, I be I be usin it n-uh
I be rubbin it, I be I be rubbin it
on my lips, my lips (ah) my lip gloss

[Chorus]</pre>
