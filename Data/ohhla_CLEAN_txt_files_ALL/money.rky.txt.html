Money make the world go round
Money make the world go round
(What? Go money)
Money makes the world go round
TM

Yo, for those who live the way that I live
We came a long way
From wiping coal outta eyelids, to rap's hottest
Fake Gazelles to black Pradas
Selling nicks to trey bags, to making hits like Kidada Jones' father
OG's would send me to the store with a dollar
Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow
Ain't nothing free in the world in life 
No matter who you are, everybody got they price
And some cost more than other's
When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living
But when you rich, it's every fat ass worth hittin'
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips
I play with the six cuz money make the whole world spin
But without the Franklin faces, you see who's your real friends
It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the JBL
It's Nas and R. Kell

[R. Kelly]
Never thought that I'd ever live this life
Money stacked in rolls, honeys on each side
Anything I want, I can say it's mine
No more worries 'bout how can I provide

[KP]  Money makes the world go round
[Nas] (Nuttin' move but the money)
[R ]  You believe it if you want to
[KP]  Money makes the world go round
[Nas] (Said nuttin' move but the money)

[R. Kelly]
Oh, many say it's wrong cuz I love to spend
Ice in everything countin' Benjamins
All I wanna do try, and let you know
If you don't believe, ask someone who's broke

[KP]  Money makes the world go round
[Nas] (Money makes the world go round)
[R ]  You believe it if you want to
[KP]  Money makes the world go round
[R ]  Yes it does
[Nas] (Still nuttin' move but the money)
[R ]  Said money makes the world go round
[Nas] (Money make the world go round, what?
      Still nuttin' move but the money)
[R ]  Nothing but the money 
[KP]  Money makes the world go round
[R ]  Yes it does

[R ]  Feels so good, yeah, yeah 
[KP]  So good, this life I finally live
[R ]  And feels so real
[KP]  So real this freedom I finally feel
[R ]  Show me the money

[KP]  Money makes the world go round
[Nas] (Go money, go money)
[R ]  You believe it if you want to
[KP]  Money makes the world go round
[Nas] (Go money, go money, yo)
[R ]  Said that almighty dollar
[KP]  Money makes the world go round
[R ]  Yes it does 
[Nas] (Still don't nuttin' move but the money)
[R ]  This brother's got to have it

[R ]  So much money

[KP]  Money makes the world go round
[R ]  Hey, makes the world go round
[KP]  Money makes the world go round

[KP]  Money makes the world go round

[KP]  Money makes the world go around
[R ]  And I'll show you a world 
[Nas] (Show me a world)
[R ]  Standing still, oh
