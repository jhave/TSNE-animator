Come on, it's like da-da-da
Come on, it's like da-da-da
Come on, it's like da-da-da, yeah

[Mystic]
This is for beautiful days manifested on the block
Where the cops sit and watch with they hands on the glock
This is for solemn prayers, that uplift the soul
And protect all people from the blisterin cold
This is for soldiers and survivors, hustlers and the 9-to-5ers
Those who know the sting of being raised without a father
For those who know the beauty, that grows from pain
Who knows the burn of hot tea is a cleansin thang
This is for those who feed they baby with a welfare check
But know the ASCAP is no help, don't mean to go and respect
This is for yo' life and mine - reminders, we shine
Supplement the nurishment to help you ease ya mind
Cuz the life is trife, the life could might
Break you down before you see the light
So suckle with the soul, you were born to see tomorrow
If you breakin from the way here's a peice that you can borrow
From now until the end we're soul controllers of our life
For all my people everywhere just know I love you right...

[Chorus]
It's the life, the life, the life, the life
The life, the life, the life, the life, yo' life
My life - our life - it's just the life

[Kam]
A waste speakin to my pain, stress, and strife, nigga save ya breath
Cuz out here, the way of life is the way of death
Left without the Knowledge of Self, we can't escape from walkin dead
(Hello?) So all we know is yellow tape, chalk, and lead
And talkin heads, so busy stalkin bread we can't see
The wool over our eyes and realize we ain't free
My people is destroyed for the lack of knowledge
But not the kind you find at public school or some cracker college
Let's turn back the mileage (Reveal this mystery)
Of how we been deprived by his-story of our glorious history
That's why my sisters be hoein and my brothers be killin
Not knowin where they from or goin, just rollin with no feelin
Gang bangin, stealin, doin dope, and dealin
So we gon' getchu open singing, bringin hope and healin
Now all these negative things, we gotta rise above
This is The Life, otherwise known as The Love

[Chorus]
It's the life, the life, the life, the life
The life, the life, the life, the life, yo' life
My life - our life - it's just the life
The life, the life, the life, the life
The life, the life, the life, the life, my life
Yo' life - our life - it's just the life

[Talib Kweli]
You could lose ya life cuz you started out winnin (Uhh)
Swimmin with a million sperm in the human race
where the end is the beginnin (Uhh)
Religion'll have you believin you born into sinnin
But if you know God like you know yo'self, who is they kiddin? (Word)
Throwin salt in the game of life, you name ya price
From the time ya head soft to the brain, till you walk with a cane
My advice is to know ya worth, everyday go to work
Hold up ya people till ya shoulders hurt,
or they put you in the dirt, word
Rollin earth goin through Heaven and Hell
Livin for the brother not fel' and the others livin dead in the cell
For the love, the Bloods, the Crips, who yell and cuss
Shit is buff, take a club to the thugs who sellin drugs
Suckin life out the ghetto the night is run by the metal
The sun settle and get black, like when the pot caught the kettle
And the freaks come out on the corners, play ya position
From the kitchen to the pimpin we on a mission steady livin
It's life

[Chorus]
It's the life, the life, the life, the life
The life, the life, the life, the life, yo' life
My life - our life - it's just the life
The life, the life, the life, the life
The life, the life, the life, the life, my life
Yo' life - our life - it's just the life
