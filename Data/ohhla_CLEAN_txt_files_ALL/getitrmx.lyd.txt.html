[Lil Wayne]
Aight, let's go...
This champagne was for me? Lloyd, I gotchu!
Yeah, okay, I'm Weezy, ba-by
And I am from the South where we call 
all our women ba-by
Hey baby, hey baby
All day I - hey, hey, hey
I'm ballin like fade-a-way
Three letter credit, A-O-K
Black card, black card
Girl, I got a black card
Can I buy some of your time
and charge it to my black card?
You can be my bittersweet
Shake that sugar AND salt
Chain full of asphalt (rocks)
Bullshit walk, cash talk
Car black, car big
Car fast, Car-ter (yeah)
Can I, stick my
pencil in your sharp-ner?
Beat it up like it's a drum
Call me Travis Bark-er
Tap-tap-tap, boom-boom, tap-tap
Boom-boom, tap-tap - BRRRRRRRRRR! PSSSSSH!!

[Chorus: Lloyd] (Lil Wayne)
All I (yeah) - really want is (what)
for you to back it up
gon' and put your weight on it (back it up, back it up)
'Cause it's alright (alriiiight!)
Do whatchu wanna (Alriiiight!)
Make me believe it, ooh I wanna see it
Get it shawty, get it shawty
('Cause it's the remix, ba-bay!)
(The remix, ba-bay! The remix, so - )
G-g-get it shawty, get it shawty
('Cause it's the remix, ba-bay!)
(The remix, ba-bay! The remix, haaaah!)

[Big Boi]
I'ma show you how to go get these hoes
Fully-clothed or the shoe models
Y'all know those that work that pole
Tight calf muscles, manicured toes
French tips for the French-kiss on
the French Riviera, ever been ther-era?
Never? Well, I'm internationally known
and accepted - gone get naked
No? I respect it, so I'ma exit
Sand in the hourglass, gone by the second
I'ma +Get Shorty+ like Danny Devi- 
to; hit a party, get it started - shall we
go, slow? Past the velvet rope
Hopin later on that she get her pelvic broke
Say ich, me, sun, chi
Ich say, me say, DIIIING DONG - PSSSSSH!!

[Chorus]

[Chamillionaire]
Go get his car and hit the mall then
buy whatever that you want and
He keep callin, keep ignorin
I'ma pick you up and we gon' bounce like Spalding
Tired of ballin chicks ike Tila
Sidekick {?} pics look like Vida
Pull it to the max, just look at my meter
Fall-in in love the minute I meet her
Groupies be tryin to act like they divas
'til I eject them out of my Beemer
Step to the side, it's lookin like we the
same as a Sumo with a wifebeater
"Super Tight..." Koopa's right
Put a lil' playarizim in yo' life
'Cause I'm the type of Grinch that you like
My money MEAN and ain't too polite
Touch and play her to dance - naw, baby stop it
Let the ride, down to do it
to the top, as it's poppin
See the door when it's lockin
Jaws will drop, as they watchin
Candy paint, changin +Huey's+
Call it +Pop, Lock, &amp; Drop'n+S - get it, shawty?
(PSSSSSH!!)
