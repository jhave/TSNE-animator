[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Now tell me who wanna fuck with us? (Who)

(BO!) Shottas, one more time lick a shot for my shottas
My pops was never there that made my mama the shotta (BO!)

So I never loved a bitch but I stay by my women
They are shottas, we are breed of achievers
That will do anything to suceed or achieve it
You walk like a shotta, you talk like a shotta
But won't stand up in the court like a shotta
Niggaz like you ought to get shot up
For actin and bein a fraudulent shotta
