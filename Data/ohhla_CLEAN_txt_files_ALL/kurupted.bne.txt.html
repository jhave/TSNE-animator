Ah, somebody say he shouldn't say a stuff like that
(Flesh -N- Bone 5th dog style)
Well, we all say a stuff like that
Here,the problem is a lot of people think that
God don't know what's going on in the world here
Do you know some, some attention! attention!! listen attention
They asked some students in a major eastern university
This trues talk
They asked Coastal maiden eastern university
The question was
Do you think that God understands raggae?

And the overwhelming majority of these students said no
God doesn't understand raggae
There was blindness in menace

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Now loom alliance
Squash, splash it blast it
Flame it stain it, cock it knock it
Win that, dash and daz tripping with me
Thing out- thing out, thing in, thing tint
Thanks bang it, bang bang
Flesh-Bone then got it, shoot
Hoo-pound shot it, shot it
Lay, sprayed it
Dream of whom, roof top niggaz
Fuck around un-cooked tough niggaz
Execute your niggaz
Turn bone shoot your niggaz
Yours is silence
Don't need no more violence
Moving in silence, moving in silence with violent intentions
No public lectures which is in him isn't entering
Pistols entering
Missiles split entering
Hollow tips losing the gin, I loose in sneaking
I've been waiting gotta give my damn
Pop the world war 2 like Warren pick
Took lil beat and that's all I'm taking
Gotta holler at my folks
Get it popping nigga
From every coast hoe
Mo bodies be dropping nigga
To strap the chrome
Pick up the microphone
World to pound be it unto def-jam, east to west
Flesh-N-Bone, bone, bone
Nigga nigga nigga

[Chorus: Flesh-N-Bone]
We on a mission
Get down for the course whatever man
Motherfuck thing
Gimme all my change
Aw bang with the chain-game
Come hang when you find them insane
All my cheese in tea
Whether put the door
When they give peace to me
When you see me in the street

[Verse 2: Flesh-N-Bone]
Me giving up struggle with the man that stares
And I am the I am that label I grind, understand
They pose my damn mo master plan
Mo thugs my mighty clan I'm rowdy by nature
Fellow G bring it in S.C.T
My city falling get that G falling in
Plead Carli kick it with the D.P.G
Causing destruction
Buckers they come rapping slugs (sshh)
For show pope, po-pull up
Strictly ball up and bullets buck pow buck
Get them up we hanging thug swinging
Just doing my thing and he also telling
Never no tell him when I'm bailing
No trailing him, kill him if he smells
Whatever he has task steady kick
Snatch you by, catch you by surprise nigga
Niggaz you choose a side
Got niggaz high, niggaz is excited
Niggaz united, cause we taking don out
We choking up burn sticky
Roll with me give you, feel me
Blunt sunk wreck, go with the bad ass spliff
Guess who's this 60's thug cyber chill
Not about all my paper
Not to get in it's my family
It's all of a kind naked ends
And this is the way we get in
So feel it, couple thugs pay the turn
With the nigga clown for the door
Milk for my thugs,  for dog pound
Niggaz be blinded
Bang with the thugs that's feeling fine
Called your money and let us pull it down, so laugh
Any body with peace squash shoulder me, choke the mask
So rap from coast to coast, keep us dog pound
And thinking my thugster hit them deception rear
While D.P. got serving nigga hoe

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Flesh-N-Bone]
Ready to shine by the time
Put them in risky
Better but nigga Bone when they cause
But they name, Bone come out
To slip it and stamp it with y'all here
Roll with the dick and straight haul up
Feeling him, hit him up back on, spirit feel
So serving that seize fire mystic come try
And they be quickly dealt with
Military minded, criminal minded thugs unite
Trap the lifts all of a sudden
Release and feel it like how many times I note you come
So what you can hear is
Street got black and Mardi top
Get them up get them up
I'm 'nough you're 'nough
From top fucking up you niggaz snuff
Yes for the, yes for the

[Demon voice]

Whatever man

[Chorus] - (Till Fade)</pre>
