[* originally released as "Coke is It" by The Kids]

Woke up one morning, turned your radio on
Couldn't find your money and your brother was gone
You ran to the kitchen, all you found was a pone
Your knew your brother's habit, couldn't silence his own
Used it ten years and now he's grown
Lost his wife and lost his friends
The way he started is the way he'll end
Usin cocaine again and again
Bright one morning drivin in his car
Smoked some dust, this time he went too far
Flew off the cliff right over the side
That was his first car and his last ride
Now you wonder why he didn't quit
But I'll tell you the answer that coke is it
His life is an end, he couldn't get through it
I told him before that he shouldn't (do it)

( *cutting up of* )
(Do it!)

Now your mother's upset
There's only two sons left
You say that's something you could never do
But now your brother's fried look rubbed off on you
Gettin all high, actin all cool
Your younger brother's grown and he finished school
Takin care of your mother and your sister too
He chose his own way, he took his own fate
He used to idealize you but now it's hate
He tried to help you, you can't say that's it
He tried to put you in a Phoenix home, you caught a fit
And now you realize that coke is it
Your life is an end, you couldn't get through it
I told you before that you shouldn't (do it)

( *cutting up of* )
(Do it!)

The tragedy won't happen to me
Now your brother's in brain surgery
Yes, your brother's rich, he's a millionaire
While you're out on the Bronx and you're on welfare
Jealous of your brother all you do is cry
Went in the room, commit suicide
Now your brother blames himself for what you have done
As you know 3 minus 2 equals 1
You could say your mother's life was a gamblin bet
Cause she started out with three, she only got one son left
You think you're cool, a Casanova
But now your life is (all over) (over) (over)
