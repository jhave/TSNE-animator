Song:   The Second Coming 
Typed by: Nature2QBC@aol.com 

[Nas] 
Third grade, singin Star Spandled Banner 
Using proper manners, learned to handle anger
Animal behavior 
Later on my block rockin wit my jocks on 
Eating Bon Ton cheese popcorn, hummin a KISS rock song 
Socks long to my knees 
Summer breeze runnin through the leaves 
Playin freeze tag, can I stay out, please dad? 
Can I hang wit my little gang out? 
Hearin shots rang out, heard my moms call my name out 
Come upstairs, run up stairs
Take a bath, shit stained underwears 
Wipe yourself wit paper 
Bad little ass in my bed at 8:30 
Wash my plate, ate dinner up late 
Gazing at the wall, prayin basketball 
Was my future for this young one 
Hooping in the sun, proud to be where I come from 
Later shootin guns fantasizing 
Fascinated by gold rope chains 
Looking back at my hood days but things ain't change 

[Chorus] *all Nas samples* 2x 
"Nasty-Nasty-Nasty Nas is a rebel to America" 
"Lyrical professor, keep ya under pressure" 
"It's like that, you know it's like that" 
"Nas-Nas'll catch wreck", "You got the mad fat fluid"

[Nas] 
Bumpy Johnson style, old timers, crocodile shoes 
Pinky rings, bank robbers wit two's, boss of wild crews 
Slacks overlapsed, apple jack hats, quarter field coats 
Cadillacs wit white walls and chrome wheel spokes 
They was organizing, investing in a piece of the hood 
They had drugs, bettin numbers, police understood 
They played the Cotton Club, red carpet, hoes on they arm 
Plush minks, pimped out gangstas, civil rights wasn't won 
E'ry Christmas they was Santa Claus 
Nixon was the anti-christ 
Bitches ass was bigger than sniffin nose candy white 
Listenin to Malcom speak, talcum powder shaving cream 
Layin back, barber chair, straight razor clean 
Babies is born, big families started to blossom 
Mad people just applied for apartments and got em 
Used to be rules to this game of hustlers and dealers 
From tommy guns to mac 10's 
QB's new born killers (shit is changed) 

Chorus 2x 

[Nas] 
Yo everytime I turn around, niggas shot, niggas stabbed 
Winter nights, pregnant girls strugglin to get a cab 
Fiends lurkin, D's searchin, pat pockets
Kids quick to bed but they heads from gats poppin 
Queensbridge slingers hoppin out Benzes, don status 
Dope fiends got syringes, poppin out they arms sractchin 
I remember park jams 
Gazelles, perfect wave shell 
Adidas, smellin reefer way before purple haze 
Private stock bare, niggas wit ill walks like Mark Clare 
Hats tilted, wild niggas lickin shots in the air 
Me and Pop was there, through the years our names would switch 
Ain't nuttin changed but the names Nastradamus and Blizz 
What project is this? 
QB, Vernon and Tenth
12th Street, murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat 
What could you tell me, nigga's seen it all in this game 
When it's all said and done, just remember my name 

Chorus 2x </pre>
