[Chorus]
I've been travelin for some time {*echoes*}
With my fishin pole and my bottle of shine {*echoes*}
On these long dark dusty roads {*echoes*}
Lookin there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
Ay-ay-ay ay-ay-ay aaay

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
I left out from mama's with my thumb in the wind
The leaves on the ground, winter's comin again
Solid on the surface as I crumble within
But legends are made out of vulnerable men
So on the brink of death I still manage livin life
Cause so rarely in this world are these chances given twice
I indeed sold my soul, without glancing at the price
No instructions when I was handed this device
But with what I did get, I was more than generous
Put others over self on several instances
But I'm back on my feet without a hint of bitterness
And one way or another I shall have deliverance
So I say

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
Can you recall a time people loved you unconditionally?
Toast in the new south, this one is for history
Then I slipped fell and caused the number's injury
Called the same people and it's yo you just missed them B
This the formula, dammit Bubba you had it
Why'd you have to keep it Polo and New Balance?
Then they start to question whether you a true talent
Or just a redneck substance abuse addict
So then you hide away just to try to find your way
And now they back to callin you 200 times a day
I want all y'all to know, good or bad I'll remember it
And 10 million sold in the name of my deliverance

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
Nothing could atone for the pain you've endured
The blood you shed is still stainin your velour
You took your wealth and knowledge and gave it to the poor
Only to discover that your savior's manure
Accepted me as kin, put before your younger brother
They put a lot on us hardly knowin one another
I honestly can say that over time I've come to love you
Now we are brothers and together no one can touch us
It hauls me with regret I never met your baby girl
She's an angel on your shoulder helpin us to save the world
This musical marriage is no coincedence
On my mama Timmy baby we shall have deliverance
So we say

[Chorus]
