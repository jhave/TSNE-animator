[Intro: R. Kelly] + (Huey)
She look what? (She look good, she bad as a muh'fucker)
She look good? (Yeah!)
I mean how's her heart? How's her head?
Her mind right? (Her brain right, shit!)
L-look, listen, nigga (yeah)
Tell your girl, if she got one of them bad muh'fuckers
that look like her and you know, act like her (yeah?)
Shit nigga, you already know what to do...
Tell your girl to hook it up...
Tell your girl to hook it up

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
If she got a friend homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a cousin homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a sister homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she look like her, act like her, holla let me hook it up
If she's sexy like that, tell your girl to hook it up
Sweet and she don't talk back, tell your girl to hook it up
If she's lookin for that real love, tell your girl to hook it up
If she look like her, act like her, partner let me hook it up

[R. Kelly]
Kells... ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Homie you was right, yeah your girl, she's a dimepiece
Nigga now I know why you ain't been hangin around me
The way she look I'd do the same, spend that time, play that game
Like to say if I'd lock that up, if I was you I'd knock that up
Open the door for her, man, pull out her chair
She may not know it but that's wifey right there
Worth it spendin that money, lookin fresh as a breeze
A sexy good girl, pretty and as sweet as can be
You could take her straight home to momma, even to meet your pastor
She don't come with no drama, damn you lucky bastard, OHH

[Chorus]

[Huey]
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh
Kells I got ya homie
It's your boy, Huey, yeah

Kells I see you pimpin in the club with the baddest chick
If she got a partner, tell her she should get with this
A well known money maker, H-U-E-Y
You need a man to give some real love you know that playa be I
The type that'll take her out the hood, make sure her hair and her nails look good
500 Benz, you can break a lil' wood, if she was my girl I'ma do what I could
As long as you understand it's 50-50, you do for me, I do for you
You shoot for me, and I'd shoot for you; you be sweet to me, and I'm sweet to you
You may think I'm lyin but it's the truth cause I ain't gotta lie to kick it
It's easy for me to be pimpin, but I'm gonna make you my mistress
To avoid the life lookin rough, head and attitude all messed up
All ya gotta do is holler at Kells and tell him gon' hook it up

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
If she like real playas and don't fuck with no haters
Wanna get with a real baller that's makin that real paper
If she want a good life, shop, hop out fancy cars
Award shows, party, mingle with the stars
Long as she understand that I am her bunny man
And when it comes to sellin out she's my sold out crowd
And if she's not the type that got a lot of boy friends
Tell her girlfriend, holler at her future boyfriend
Hook it up!

[Chorus]

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Huey! Kells my nigga, yeah
We in the club, see that exit sign, girl walk it out
We in the club, see that exit sign, girl walk it out
Yeah, this might be the remix here</pre>
