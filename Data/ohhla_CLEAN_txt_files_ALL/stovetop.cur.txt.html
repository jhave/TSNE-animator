Yea
Drive In theater

Uh
Tryna get this loot any way true
Itâs lucrative and from alls I do make through
Itunes and avenues we move weight
Each one in my crew get a full plate
Not one excused till we all ate
Unified stupid high nigga way paid
Crime did just what they said it would
Some niggas living good
Some is gone away for good
Some stuck in the hood
Addicted to it
What he should have sold, lost his soul
Though his body still living look in his eyes
The fire ain't in them
He used to be driven
Now that's cold
Cold blooded as my angel wings flooded
Rolls gold star studded
The bar covered so let it pour
Until it bubble on the floor
Baby love peeling out her clothes
Eyes rolled orgasm dancing while these horns blow
I'm just thing on my next score
Which color we should paint the sixty four
Tryna wrap my hands round the globe
Like a motherfucking choke hold
Ho
Drive In Theatre

Bent over the stove cus they want some more
Knockin at my door
Back at the store cus they want some more
All of yall</pre>
