[Petey Pablo]
With it with it one mo' 'gin, Petey back in this bitch (HA!)
Wit-a wit-a wit-a new-new damn flow that's sick
Get ready to change it back, it's a new ball in the game now
New rules, ain't no out of bounds
Nigga nigga this shit's storm, them boys
Keep your, proper composure, your p-poise (y-yeah)
We don't want a forum, we just wanna show 'em
That-that we got somethin if we need to throw 'em
Maaaan, we the coolest that there is (nigga)
This here, this year, came with the papers and package, it did
I'm a, I'm a real gangsta
Slash, rapper, you the dick?
Greasy grimy grid-itty, ain't no playin Pid-etey
Really God-didi-damn, POW, nah
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM  them them didi-there it is
I'm expectin nothin but motherfuckers jumpin

[Chorus]
WHEN IT GET, LIVE! JAM, LIVE!

[Petey Pablo]

It won't go tolerate some more time forrr them to make up they mind
Puttin the call that no close somewhere we at lady
Sh-sh-shakin your groove thang (p-p-playa)
Doin it the playa way
So what'chu gon' do now we got you, got you lit up in the light?
And blunted up and high
You like it, like (your) nighty-night
(Full of) somethin-somethin (fun) and excitin
Really really one of one of them, a hot tamale
Pants fittin tight as a, pair of stockings (Lord)
Lookin round this p-party
Each and everybody crunk up and, rowdy-rowdy
'Bout to be a whole bunch of motherfuckers in this motherfucker tearin up
Nigga get much (nigga get what!) GET GET GET GET UP!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, yo
