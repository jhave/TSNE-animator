Give me my money!

[Planet Asia talking]
We gettin' paper on this one..."Aoooowww"
Underground niggaz gettin' money
"The good life"...and ya dont stop
"Aoooowww"

[Planet Asia]
Ay yo we first class
Vergin' splurgin' mergin' with professionals
Soul food fanatics all be strung out on my vegetables
Mic merchants meditate on it til it's visual
To what I believe in even if the situation's critical
We chop slang like equipment
So here's another shipment, a dosage of atomic liquids
We live the good life similar to the way we always come thru
Fresh fitted like we did it and we wake up when we want to
Always hungry for the work we get
Filter the scheme out for the cream
Like ain't a such thang like strikin' it rich
Connectin' big checks
Back in the days we used to do the disco
Now we highly recognized thru representin' L.A. to Frisco
It's Cali Agents, we came to bost ya high
Some days for nothin' you can catch me rockin' suits and ties
Fresh off the global tour I'm on retour
Rippin' tracks until it's triple plat
Than it's back to the hood to make sure I'm supprorted

[2x Chorus Rasco &amp; (Planet Asia)]
"The good life", We keep livin' it y'all, we keep livin (what)
"Aoooowww" We keep livin' it y'all
We stay tight, you goddamn right
You know how we do, we keep livin'

[Rasco]
I want the exact same shit they got
But I'ma get mines a whole 'nother way
A million dollar pay day
Door to door, got ya back hittin' the floor
The service got this whole spot nervous
I know you heard this, it ain't a thang
I'm rollin' in the '99 Sting that's red and cost a whole lotta bread
White gold to flash, hand to the crotch
Get down town and cop a cold ass watch *brrr*
No ice banks I don't flash my cash
I go to the bank and put it on with the stash
We mash dipped in fresh gear all year
And I think back to when it wasn't all here
Five thousand chips a song
Don't come at Rasco long and switch man
I'm tryin' to get rich
Two c notes from quotes just won't flow (nigga)
I can't be broke, you had too much to smoke (nigga)
I sit back and take head to the chair there near
Go home break out the pad and the beer
From beginning to end, in the game to win
Watch niggaz get funny when they money is thin
Keep mines thick, you can eat a fat dick fo' sho'
You better show up with all my dough
Still servin' the pipe, earn yo stripes
And maybe you cats can start livin'

[2x Chorus]

[Planet Asia]
This ain't yo ordinary cuz we felt this
Zonin' for the come up when the guns are pointed at you offa hennessey and roaches
Nigga said that I was selfish
Cuz I went from what was destined to take place
My scratch match and runnin' out with big faces
Later haters dictate, CA the sound
No time to clown around, thousand the first to spit it on your mixtape
Passion dank, cash on the blank
Wild whip cross to blow shit, laughin' on the way to the bank
I seen it comin' as a youngin though
Mentally possessed for the limelight
Cali Agents bout to up the ???? in mo'
Don't try to act like you ain't heard about us
We on some HipHop shit, underground
But whether not this thick ya know
My lyrical formats is phatter than the average
I battle like a savage, maniac microphone technician
We stay tight, you goddamn right
You know how we do, we keep livin'

[2x Chorus]

[Rasco]
Yo,I spit it from the lips for chips
I break legs and hips to get it all thru the contract starve
Even the cats that advise wanna capitalize
I'ma show you how the black man rise
See we do things that other cats can't do
The simplest shit like how to spit the 1 2
Now you watch Ras' and Planet As' get bait
And this here song is like the best shit made
Gray day pop off the choice, my loud voice
We spit so much we need a whole crowd moist
Now watch how we catch the whole damn batch
And we stay underground to earn that scratch
Don't be mad cuz your career went bad
You niggaz should give it up and wave that flag
I know that I brag but yo somebody should
When I make cash I spend it all in the hood
I wish a nigga would try to hold my check
I'd hit him with blows and lay his back on the deck
Still servin' the pipe, earn yo stripes
And maybe you cats can start livin'

[Chorus 2x]

[Planet Asia talking]
Y'knowI'msayin'...the good life
Underground cats makin' good dough
Rasco...Planet Asia...Cali Agents
West Coast's finest...welcome to
Need to get this paper y'knowI'msayin'
Capitalizin' and all that</pre>
