[Intro]
Yeah, yo, yo, uh
Ja Rule, huh, Murder Inc. nigga
(How many wanna die with me?)
Come on, come on
Yo, yo

1 - I'mma ride to the end of the road baby
     This life gon' drive me crazy
     Been gettin' high lately
     Wonderin' when the Lord gon' take me
     Where the fuck my gangsta's at? (Yeah)
     Where the fuck my bitches at? (Ohhh)

Never gon' see shit without the Lord, they say
What's a nigga to do but kneel down and pray?
Lord, forgive me
They're lookin' down on shit
Sometimes I feel I need out this shit
Spin it 'round one time
Close my eyes, then click
Once I'm dead, maybe I'll deserve all this
World, get off of me
Niggas hitting at Ja from what it sound like
Shit niggas hitting at Rule, don't even sound right
Like I'm that nigga that went platinum damn near over night
You're all welcome, niggas know you wanna live my life
May God help 'm
I'm possessed by my sacrifice
Bitches and ice got me lovin' hell's paradise
You feelin' me?

Repeat 1 (2x)

My life is caught up in some other shit
But I do deal with it
If it floods your heart, live it
Nigga don't die up in it
Just cause my soul's trippin' outta control
Smashed up on the freeway
It's gotta be the drug role, give me lee-way
Cock it back and unload murderers don't fold
Any actions need to be shown?
There we go, lots of holes
Always rap upon my foes
I keep niggas on they toes
Bitches know to get that dough
Niggas know fuck them hoes
We that heat that can't be froze
We that burn that leaves you cold
We them guns you can't unload
We that platinum, not that gold
We them niggas you just can't touch
We them niggas that's just too much
Y'all don't wanna fuck with us
We them niggas, murderers

Repeat 1 (2x)

2 - How many wanna die wit me?

Repeat 2 (8x)

How many wanna die wit me, die wit me?

Evidently these niggas want me out my mind
If you had your way, I would be dead on sight
But I shed my pain, so now my love is life
Niggas hatin' on Ja, and shit ain't half as tight
Hey, you feeling me?
Niggas don't wanna get to close, I'm cut throat
Throw em away like bad coke
You ain't know?
Ja Rule's a killa nigga
Ain't the one to be fucked with
Fuck around, get dealt with
Cock and slide and pull the clip
Nigga ya fearin' this

Repeat 1(2x)

Repeat 2 (7x)

How many wanna die wit me, die wit me?

Repeat 2 (7x)

How many wanna die wit me, die wit me?

Repeat 2 (7x)

How many wanna die wit me, die wit me?</pre>
