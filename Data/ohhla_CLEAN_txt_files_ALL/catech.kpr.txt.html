[Intro: Killah Priest]
Yeah
Killah Priest
Iron Shiek comin back
Ready to attack
Freestyle
You know my energy get real hype in me
Yo

[Killah Priest]
Move out my fuckin way boy you gonna get sliced
I seek revenge upon the earth like Christ
A mind is not called a rapture
It's more like a rap tour
Where niggas get cornered with a cracked jaw
I divide niggas like religion
End at abandonin' shit, tellin' mad lies to your vision
Burnin' me is invain and imaginary
You must be insane and fuckin' with mad theories
All niggas gash you, thoughts could match this
Got burnt, and return to mothafuckin' ashes
Your show is weak and your dead body corpses
My rap slew the youth like death and divorces
Now take em through the chamber, watch 'em feel the danger
Of a guillotine, this is how I kill a team
Don't scream bitch, have you ever seen an iller dream?
A nightmare, causin' you a slight fear
Come the omens 'til you fallin' through your right ear
Your eyes bubble, but there lies trouble ahead 
Niggas are dead, you better cry double
Comin' it's that ill ass rapper with that sick ass
laughter (ha, ha, ha, ha)
You cannot escape the chapter
Once you try, then you feel the hooks
After you die, that's when I conceal the books

[Outro: Killah Priest]
Conceal the books, conceal the books
Overlook, conceal the books
It's you and I, conceal the books
And I'm out
KP the all mighty, the icon
Yea, it's that revived, revived, hip-hop
Gritty, this is real hip-hop
Untouchable, one love</pre>
