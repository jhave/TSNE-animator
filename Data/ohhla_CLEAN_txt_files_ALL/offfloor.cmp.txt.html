[Chorus]
I been getting money I ain't worried 'bout a ho
You better check your bitch cause she been creeping on the low
No matter the occasion I'ma always get the dough
Throw it at the strippers watch 'em get it off the flo'
I been getting money, I been I been getting money
I been getting money, I ain't worried bout a ho
I been getting money, I been I been getting money
I been getting money, watch 'em get it off the flo'

I been getting money I ain't worried bout a ho
Know niggas with the white call it Marilyn Monroe
No need to spit the game because I had her at Hello
But she always bitching cause I'm in the studio
Hopscotch the pussy so you know I'm in and out
I scramble for the cheese like I work at Waffle House
The game needs change and i found it in the couch
I swear these niggas trash they remind me of the grouch
Hold up, wait a second, I'm gone!
I'ma sprint to the bill like a phone
Raise your hand if you getting that paper
Or you want that shit like foams
I'ma north side nigga, rep your zone
Fuck your rules, I'm grown
You better check your ho cause last night she ain't even come home

[Chorus]

Do you get the picture? I ain't talking Instagram
Alley-Oop to Donald and I know he 'bout to slam
I just want to smoke and take a trip to Amsterdam
And hit a couple hoes who pussy just as sweet as yams
Baby I'm a player but I'm acting like the coach
Dive inside your water, hit you with the backstroke
Hungry for the green and i ain't talking artichoke
I drive these hoes crazy hope my license ain't revoked
You know these hoes don't love you, they'll fuck you for a check
Then play you like a sucker
Stay on your A game, don't get played like a buster
I'ma always stay true nigga word to my mother

[Chorus]</pre>
