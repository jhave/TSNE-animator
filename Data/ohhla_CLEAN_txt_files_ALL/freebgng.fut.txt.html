[Verse 1]
Designers on my face cuz I will never see a hater 50,000$ worth of jewelry

Commando guns only freebands can save ya
Transformal cars pulling up in some in place
We got that freeband money and we got that long paper
(freeband) tossing up yo babymama with no conversation
She like the way I flex with my astronaunt persona
I rather take my shoes off if it ain't dolce and gabana
Two cups filled up we drinking strong marijuana
whats the use of having muscles you cant flex all summer

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ugh I'm on my slug boo and shit

And future they hating they just love doing them

And I be nutting up know homo

And skooly well protected by them thugs
