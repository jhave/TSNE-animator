[Intro]
Yeah {*echoes*}
Gucci Mane, Big Cat

[Gucci Mane]
Growin up was real hard on my block
Cops and robbers I was never the cop
To be the cop was considered a joke
I'm the same lil' nigga taught your brother to smoke
But now-a-days man I stay on the news
My every move airs up on the tube
Whoever said bein a gangster was easy
I got beef with BMF and I got problems with Jeezy
To be a gangster is a full time job
A Bad Boy but I ain't Black Rob
The pay's good but the hours are crazy
You disrespect me I'ma see ya degraded
I'm never scared but I'm thinkin ahead
because they don't bury the scared man, they bury the dead
An ex-con but I'm out on bond
Wave bye to the bad guys, Teflon Don

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Got my name in the paper and my face on the news
Gucci Mane, Laflare, e'rybody, e'rybody know me
E'rybody know me
Nigga Gucci Mane, Laflare, I'm a real O.G.

[Gucci Mane]
You wanna take it to the street nigga? Let's go there
There ain't nothin 'tween us pussy nigga but air
But you better prepare, 'fore you fuck with Laflare
I'll have you roll around freakin a wheelchair
See I don't fight fair, nah I don't fight fair
Gucci Mane'll put that ass in intensive care
Matter fact if you see me fight a grizzly bear
I suggest that you help the fuckin grizzly bear
Ain't no pussies over here nah it's just G's
Ain't no time for no talk, nigga cock it and squeeze
Got these hoe type ass niggaz weak at the knees
Shoot 223's that'll chop down trees
Gucci Mane out of jail man, what I'm gon' do now
That Jeezy lil' bitch ass thinkin out loud
Gucci Mane out of jail man, what I'm gon' do now
That Jeezy lil' bitch ass thinkin out loud

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
You m'uhfuckers must don't know who they mess with
I'm that outlaw, Wild Wild West shit
I'm on that two clips, AK and a vest shit
You motherfuckers must don't know who you fuckin with
I'm not a kid, Gucci Mane full grown
So bring the choppers, leave the nines at home
And call the coppers cause I'm aimin for domes
I'll have you call a full backup on the phone
The franchise, but Gucci Mane ain't wearin no white tee
You niggaz hate the fact that niggaz so icy
But fuck that, niggaz don't gotta like me
Cause seein niggaz shit split it excite me
Picture me high off the weed like a kite be
I took your bitch through my hood just to sightsee
I screen niggaz so I stay on that skreet shit
And if there's drama then it's you I'ma deal with

[Chorus]</pre>
