[Intro: Jeremih]
OH! YEAH! OH! YEAH! OH! YEAH! OOOOHHHHH!!!!

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I think I love you, don't let me get in the way (Get in the way)
Don't let me stop you girl, from doin your thing (Doin your thing)
'Cause I don't deserve you (NO!) I don't wanna hurt you, play with your mind
Have you runnin in circles, don't let me get in your way (Get in your way)
Yeah!

[Verse One: Lloyd Banks]
It ain't even the puss I got you ma
It's usually a one way thing but baby girl got mine
Perfection is the formula when me and her combine
Like candy to the corn and yeah you're finger lickin fine
In due time I'm sure that I can please ya, squeeze ya, weak knees ya
Need ya like you need me, and don't mislead ya
Love's free, but treat it wrong and pay the price 
Get down on one knee, that bitch 'gon leave with half your life 
Man believe me, I ain't 'gon feed ya bad advice
Look it's easy, so don't forget to strap up tight
Ride, hide yourself as if I kept you so
I love you enough to let you go
Cause on the other hand I couldn't take it
If I, put all I got in you and someone got you naked
You work hard for money but it's harder when you make it
This chick's comin fast, here's your heart 'fore I break it

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I think I love you, don't let me get in the way (Get in the way)
Don't let me stop you girl, from doin your thing (Doin your thing)
'Cause I don't deserve you (NO!) I don't wanna hurt you, play with your mind
Have you runnin in circles, don't let me get in your way (Get in your way)
Yeah!

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
Uhh, what type of nigga would I be to hold you up?
You need someone to hold you down and wreck, ya life's fucked up
I gotta shake you out my system cause with the fuckin and kissin
And all your emotions mixin puts me in a tough position
Baby what I am supposed to do?
I can't control my actions when I'm close to you
We been away too long, girl we overdue
I guess the cake get enough, you wanna eat it too
See me and you, have a magnet in between, like it's pullin me close
I'm like a addict for your scream, you're fully loaded toast
A automatic with the beam, the baddest on the coast
I got to have you like the green, your swagger's more than most
I got a sex drive that won't allow me to 'lax
Bring on the next five, look how they crowd on my lap
Booty breast thighs keep ya boy relapsin back
And you deserve way more than that, I'll just fall back

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I think I love you, don't let me get in the way (Get in the way)
Don't let me stop you girl, from doin your thing (Doin your thing)
'Cause I don't deserve you (NO!) I don't wanna hurt you, play with your mind
Have you runnin in circles, don't let me get in your way (Get in your way)

[Outro: Jeremih]
I've been thinkin a long time, that, wishin that you were just all mines
But, maybe this is the wrong time, yeah, that I deserve ya, I don't deserve ya
I've been thinkin a long time, that, wishin that you were just all mines
But, maybe this is the wrong time, yeah, that I deserve ya, I don't deserve ya
I don't deserve ya, I don't deserve ya, I don't deserve ya........
