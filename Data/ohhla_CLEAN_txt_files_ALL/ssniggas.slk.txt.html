[Silkk the Shocker]
Yeah I got love for the world, east, west, north
I gotta do this one for the hood, ya heard me?
So when ya'll ask me where I'm from
This is where I'm from
So fake niggas don't ask me no shit

[MP]
Man what the fuck you mean where I'm from nigga?
You know where I'm from and how I come 
No Limit nigga represent it cuz I'm in it
Check this shit out gangster made No Limit

Southside, we be them southside niggas
From the southside, we be them southside niggas (3X)

[C-Murder]
I'm a killer from New Orleans 
Smoking weed, selling quarters
Tru niggas count bank
leave you dead up in a stank
ask the colonel I'm the captain of this motherfucking army
young niggas getting killed if they try to fuck they homie
ask the world if we bout it
ask my block if I'm rowdy
No limit tatted on my arm
Only dead niggas doubt it
niggas fighting on my verse when i mothafucking curse
from the ghetto to the clubs all i see is mean mugs

From the southside, we dem southside niggas (4X)

[Silkk the Shocker]

and niggas still fighting in clubs nigga, what
Say the wrong words

So i give a fuck if you do, give a fuck if you don't like'em
I say Ahhhh and everybody start fighting, ( What's Up )
