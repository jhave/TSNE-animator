[Missy (Aaliyah)]
Uh uh (yea yea)
Uh uh (yea yea)
99 uh uh (yea yea) what you got boo)

[Aaliyah (Missy) - Verse One]
I was in love wit' you (yea)
And you couldn't do no wrong in my eyes
When I found out the scoop on you (yea)
It was still too hard for me to realize
That I needed to be through' wit you (yea)
Cuz you're the reason I can't eat or sleep (yea)
All the girls you runnin' through (yea)
Used to be best friends, down wit' me

[CHORUS]
When I'm gone, you're alone
You stickin' them chickens til I get home
When I'm home, you're wit' me
Kissin' on my ass, tryna be wit' me
Well it's done, this I know
Seen it for myself, I'ma let you know
You don't play, games wit' me
But before I go, betta leave my dough

[Missy - Verse Two]
I'ma fool for you (yea)
But you seem to think my love's a joke (it aint a joke boo)
I get no love from you (yea)
Like all these times I did before
I think I'll pass on you (yea)
Because of the way you been actin' lately
I get no cash from you (yea)
If you want me to stay, you must be cra-crazy

[Repeat CHORUS]

[CHORUS TWO]
Dedication
It was jus a bad relation (yes it was, yes it was)
When I think it cuts my insides
The tears, they fall deep down from my eyes
(repeat)

[Bridge - Aaliyah &amp; Missy ]
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo (wha say what, uh uh uh)
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo (Da Brat)

[Da Brat]
I want it al' from the motherfuckin' house, down to the dogs 
You trickin' off with these chickens, I thought you ain't have no flaws 
Keep yo dick in they jaws, Peter shoulda stayed in his draws 
Now I'm out the door and you cant claim me no more 
The loss is yours 
How you gonna slumber wit' a bitch I'm supposed to be cool wit'
Went to grade school wit', couldn't pay me to believe you hit it 
To think I footed all the bills and now you breakin 
Stop accusin' me of that dumb shit I don't even participate in 
You wasted my valuable time there's money to make 
Scared to set foot in another relationship cuz of the heartache 
Heartbreak Hotel no not Faith, Kelly, and Whitney, no it's Brat, Aaliyah and 
Missy You miss me cuz we finished
I'll just keep the keys to the 20 inch rim ride with the TVs in it 
You don't need it, beat it, it's mine
Kiss my ass like your heart was in it (stupid ass)
Keep stickin' them chickens 
Send Peter straight to the clinic nigga

[Missy]
See I'ma give you your props tho
You like a bad ass motherfucker
Runnin' two bitches at one time
When I'm flyin' out, she flyin' in
Sayin' the same shit, spittin' the same game
Who the fuck you think I am
Willy Limpdick or somebody, forget you man
That's why us bitches gonna stick together
Bitch
