Intro:
Yo Saafir what's goin' on playboy? 
Saafir: What's really goin' on? 

Huh, you tell me baby. 

Saafir:Hey, it's like this man. 
I gotta let these motherfuckers know how to crawl man. 

I know everybody tryin' to come up immediately. 

Saafir:You know they don't got the motherfuckin' perseverance cause they 
ain't have it hold up though. I gotta go and do this man.

Verse 1:
You can hear the ambition mobbin' in my po position
The intention is to come up 
Do your grindin' pay the boss before you floss
And don't lose your mind and find discipline' 
And stackin' your scratch 
So it don't come up missin' in
As you're askin' the Lord for guidance
While you ridin' 
Stickin' and movin' slidin' 
In and out the game
Unless you realize you're sprung before you legalize your funds
All you track hustlers that was made for the corner 
Dodgin' the coroner's office 
I'm tossin' this at you
Now on some sermon type shit 
I'm burnin' and I gotta write this
The mic got me ballin' 
Shot callin' 
It's the murk one like that 
Sit back but not in starship 
So I don't tarnish or rust 
When I'm bustin' on the next jerk
Who swears he's ballin' but can't network
You better off with sexwork
The way you fucked in the game
It's a shame
I'm aimin' at the bathroom stall on all of y'all
With the H.J.s deflecting these hate rays
Until the sun falls 
You acquired a dream
Crawl before you ball

Hook:      (x2)
What you thought?
You was just gonna ball on the spot?
Let's be real
You gotta stack dollar bills before you get a mil
Gotta handle business before you choose to chill or you fall
Crawl before you ball  

Verse 2:
All you pompous ass marks in Babylon yawnin' 
Becomin' another nigga spawnin'
&gt;From the trenches 
The stench is unknown 
I've been crawlin' like a two toed 
Chameleon for so long 
Writing these songs and ridin' these thongs
With bracelets on they ankle bone
That's anxious to moan 
Like Neena Samone
Have a trick 
Sickin' thinkin' 
That we know it's on 
You better crawl before you ball man
Before you fall man
Keep ya hoes off your payroll
Unless they crawl with you 
And you know they all with you 
And even then they won't fall with you
I'm like fuck 'em
I got to 
It's a new sheriff in town his name is Reggie Mamoo
Ya hear?
More like Saafir
On a crawl 
By watch how daddy ball
I'm all ears and all eyes 
Recognize 
I'm crawlin'

Bridge:      (x2)
Baby baby let me kick my all to y'all
You gotta crawl before you ball
I've seen so many many soldiers fall
They didn't know you had to crawl before you ball

Verse 3:
You see gotta put in major work in at first 
Before you burst
Crawl before you ball but never lose your thirst
When you ballin' 
Or you gonna end up broke and butt naked with no garments on
While I'm makin' more cheese than Parmesian
Learn game at a fast rate
Apply it to my walk then stalk
I won't fall off cause I'm a put in that work
And I'm a stick to that plan 
Now I'm a stay down with my folleys 
The team then turn and brace God gave green
Going, going till I'm gone
I'm ballin'
