[Intro/Chorus: Yung Joc]
Yeah I've been there (been there) and I've done that (done that)
Used to knock the pussy out, now she runnin back
So I knock the pussy out - knock it out, knock it out
I knock the pussy out - knock it out, knock it out
Yeah I've been there (been there) and done that (done that)
Used to knock the pussy out, now she runnin back
So I knock the pussy out - knock it out, knock it out
I knock the pussy out - knock it out, knock it out

[Yung Joc]
First thang first I like all kinda hoes
Some go to school, some dance with no clothes
Momma name me Joc cause I do the damn thang
When I throw the dick, they come back like boomerangs
Beat the pussy up like a old beat machine
"Whoomp, There it Is" - bring a friend, +Tag Team+
Then I beat her mouth like the woofers in my vert'
I give her Tylenol cause she say her jaws hurt
Meet a chick like Trina, make her dreams come true
Baby when I cum, guarantee you cum too
And like Three 6 the dick +Hypnotize Minds+
I put that on my momma baby if you think I'm lyin

[Hook]
Lil' mama I'ma (beaaaaaaaaaaaat it up)
All night I'ma (beaaaaaaaaaaaat it up)
That mouth, I'ma (beaaaaaaaaaaaat it up)
That back, I'ma (beaaaaaaaaaaaat it up)
That's right I've

[Chorus]

[Yung Joc]
One plus one, yep that equals two
Bitches on deck, one for me and one for you
Just the way I like 'em, straight A-Town
Meet me in the room, guaranteed to go down
Now your baby daddy mad, you went and spilled the beans
Don't get mad cause she on my drill team
I turn virgins into sex fiends
I turn nightmares into wet dreams
Make her juicebox wet, make her thank she on her cycle
Hit her from the back when I grab her by her Michaels
Make her touch her toes 'til her knees turn weak
Neighbors complain cause they say they can't sleep

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Yung Joc]
When it's time for round three, strap on another glove
T.K.O. now the hoe all in love (aww)
She love to call me Tyson when I nibble on her ear
I hit her with a combo, now she call me Holyfield
I know it sounds vulgar but that's the way she like it
Got the world's biggest (shhh) don't matter just don't bite it
No I'm not conceited, but see I keep it trill
Playboy Shawty, Mr. Black &amp; Decker Drill
If your girl say my name, please don't take offense
Handle it like gents or get in some gangsta shit
Now I don't thank it's worth it if you really want the truth
Cause at this present time she givin brain in the booth

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Lil' mama I'ma (beaaaaaaaaaaaat it up)
All night I'ma (beaaaaaaaaaaaat it up)
That mouth, I'ma (beaaaaaaaaaaaat it up)
That back, I'ma (beaaaaaaaaaaaat it up)
Lil' mama I'ma (beaaaaaaaaaaaat it up)
All night I'ma (beaaaaaaaaaaaat it up)
That mouth, I'ma (beaaaaaaaaaaaat it up)
That back, I'ma (beaaaaaaaaaaaat it up)
That's right</pre>
