Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm so high
Find me somewhere in the sky
And I know these days just flow by
When you're so high
Head is somewhere in the sky
And you know these days just flow by
When you're so high
Yea, my name is mac miller
And u are now living
The high life
Most dope
Big Jerm I see ya
Get into it</pre>
