[ VERSE 1 ]
I can be paid, and don't have to have money
Jump off a bridge, and don't have to use bungee
I like Cypress Hill, and don't have to smoke blunts
And when the beat comes in, you don't have to jump
Oh yeah, it don't have to be 'oh no'
Serch rides the rhythm, but it doesn't have to flow
You can be beefin, and not be a Tom
Go get skins, and don't have to be a John
I can raise the roof, and not have a home
Go solo, and don't have to be alone
I can be Simon, and don't have to draw
Step to the a.m. and not sit by the door
I can have pockets, and don't have to be swollen
Fat-ass beat, and it don't have to be stolen
Went a 1000 places, and didn't have to be hike that
World full of hate, and it don't have to be like that

[ CHORUS ]
	And it don't quit
	And it don't stop
	When it don't quit
	Then it don't stop
	When it don't quit
	Then it don't stop
	It keeps on and on		(2x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I can come ghetto, and don't have to be a bastard
Hold a conversation, and don't have to have the last word
Shoot the gift swift, and not miss the street
Even - ehm - and not come off the beat
Oh yeah, be ??? without shootin at the earth
Even be gold, and not have any worth
You can beat beef, and don't need utensils
Write ruff rhymes without pens and pencils
Mad low end, and I don't have any treble
Be like rock, and it don't have to metal
Be in Detroit and don't have to be a Piston
Tell me a white lie, yo, I don't have to listen
I can walk, and I don't have the need
Catch a cut, but I don't have to bleed
Go to a club, and I don't have to sweat
Chill, time to go, but you don't have to get up yet

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
I can be the U.S., and don't have to war
I can get open, and don't need any door
I can get loud, and don't have to scream
Peace to Dr. King, and don't forget about the dream
Oh yes, oh yes, I don't have to be a yes-man
Go get married, and don't have to have a best man
I can be positive, and don't have to be a plus
If you're not gettin papes, then you're not down with Rush
I can have skills, and don't need a trade
I can be in London, don't have to like rain
Nots, nots, nots, and not have any rope
Go take a shower, but don't need any soap
Point me to the mic, I need no rehearsal
Yes, I'm the man, there'll be no role reversal
I can be blue, and don't have to be the jeans
Don't wear the X hat when you don't know what it means
