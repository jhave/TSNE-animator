Song:   I'm So Hood
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yeah.. YEAH.. YEAH!

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Lil' Tyrone tired of gettin his ass whipped, so he holdin that gat down
His momma think it's my fault, cause he listened to "Back Down"
Bobby was a fuckin bum, he pumpin backs now
He need some fresh chicks, white T's and fitted hats now
Uncle Rock a wino, he won't put the 'gnac down
Eric had the jump shop, but he's smokin crack now
The Lunatics, the Lost Boyz, Cheeks shit is whack now
Country blew trial, them crackers got him on his back now
And Sean {*ka-click*} runnin round with his fuckin gat now
Up in niggaz cribs, sayin where that money at pal?
Now Sandra from BK I seen her out in Houston
That bitch travelled the world, she runnin round boostin
Now Toya got these bad-ass kids, they a nuisance
Her baby daddies never come around, they useless
Every now and then I come through on some new shit
Pearly white 6 or some chrome deuce-deuces

[Chorus: 50 Cent - repeat 2X]
I'm so hood - I can't help it
I'm so hood - I can't help it
Love me for bein me - cause I can't change it
Can't rearrange it, I am what I am
So love me for bein me

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
When I was six man, momma told me God don't like ugly
I fell, scraped my face, and thought God must don't love me
Saw Owen every mornin before school, he sell dope
Niggaz keep whuppin Nut ass cause he sell soap
Charlie be beggin all the time, he stay broke
Flip be down on 1-0-9, rollin up smoke
Shameek, he a thief, catch a stunt in a stolen car
He that nigga that you call when you crashin into a bar
See they love me cause I rap now, but they don't like me
I been locked up three times and they ain't write
Stevie a punk, but fuck what he say, he can get mean quick
Pop shots at you, Esau must suck a mean dick
The block's hot, D's jump out on us almost all the time
They watch us from the buildin but niggaz still be on the grind
Wayne used to call the cops and tell them G had a 9
'Til G put that gun in Donrad seat and said it wasn't mine

[Chorus]</pre>
