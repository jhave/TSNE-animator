[ VERSE 1 ]
Bystanders better duck, somebody better call police
Another Heather B freestyle done hit the streets
Laced to the nines, my chrome-dipped rhymes
They gon shine, then blind your next weak-ass line
And aimed at your head is a infrared circle
Of sentences with messages that read 'Fuck you'
I chip tooths, knockin 'em lose at one time
That's for all them hoes that don't write they own rhymes
Repeat after me, 'Heather B, Heather B'
Lyrically, lyrically got all these hoes shook
What, you think you can't get yo title took?
You are not the type to even hold on much
You rhyme but I write, you fuss but I fight
I am all the truth and you are all the fuckin hype
I don't like no fake-ass MC
So any problems with that, you come see me

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now you can find me in Brooklyn but I'm a Jersey resident
The only sister station at the 54th Regiment
Heather ( ? ) send me but I'm ghetto-sent
And I flips mad shit with the New York accent
Come at me if you can fuck up the other 53
And that wild nigga Walt got the heat
Up under the driver's seat I know he got a long gat
And I'd be a fool to tell you were the other toolie at
So all y'all with weak lines and jammed nines
I see that you missed the point in my last rhyme
Take off yo weak-ass frown, you ain't the man of your town
Yo nigga, I meant you when I said 'Glocks down'
Don't ever force me to have to flaunt it
I'm sayin if I ever grow a dick you'll be on it
I twist ya like a cap, split yo back like a dutchie
If you touch me, you can't touch me even if yo touch is Midas
I'm as  versatile as any nigga playin two sports
And all y'all brand new ideas already been my thoughts
Who wants the wrath of 50 niggas poundin that ass
I suggest you wave your flag and just call this shit quits
