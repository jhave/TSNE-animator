Song:   Flat Out
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Trinidad James]
What's your set bout'
Me and my niggaz, we flat out [x4]

[Verse 1: Wale]
Told you niggaz, "Do not fuck with us"
Hope you niggaz do not fuck with us
You caught feelings cause I caught her attention
She caught a flight after I caught a nut (whoa!)
Shoutout to my brothers, doe
Quote me too
You goin' make some haters when you love a ho
Heart is the line, God bless my soul
Profit of my infectious flow
Pardon if my vocab ain't good
But the school I was in ain't have no books
These whack niggaz never had me shook
I ain't from a town that is ran by crooks
Get the work from out of town for the money and the power
Niggaz steppin' on the powder like it's alley [?]
Know y'all got, come get at me first
Little nigga better act your worth
Understand niggaz got to be heard
Why the fuck niggaz got to be heard

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
I usually don't do freestyles
My style ain't free, nigga
Fresh from head to toe
I said fly from the feet up
I said, you're looking for a real nigga
Bitch, look up and you'll see us
You lookin' for your bitch, nigga
Don't look up, she with Jesus
I said hallelujah, bitch pop the pussy
So she raise her hands and pop the pussy
I'm with Wale, that's MMG
Now Molly make her go woo
And that money make me show out
My grind wasn't blacked out
Real nigga, don't do handouts
My mama crib my stashhouse
In the Yeezy box, nigga oh Lawd
Nigga Ziploc and my Concordes
Tell the Feds I don't give a fuck
I'm the man now, I'm the man now
And that's DC to the A town
I said DC to the A town
And when I fuck, niggaz, that's hands down
But in DC, they say flat out

[Chorus]</pre>
