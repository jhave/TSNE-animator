[Chorus: Mike Smith]
What I've learned, from this thug life I'm livin
Is it's a cold cold world, and I know at times it gets to ya
You gotta keep pushin, gotta keep pushin
Gotta keep pushin, gotta keep pushin
Gotta keep pushin  you gotta keep pushin
And at any given moment
You can end up with your back on the wall
I know at times it gets to ya
Gotta keep pushin, you gotta keep pushin
You know gotta keep pushin, you gotta keep pushin
You know you gotta keep pushin you gotta keep pushin

(Sheek)
Yeah cuz I push I push, and that money a drop
And them bottles a pop, and I'm at the bar
With my big cigar, with my shades and hoody on, I'm a superstar
With my hands up high and I'm extra high
And she extra fly, tell ya friends goodbye
Yeah westside doin it can only fit two in it
The night is good so don't ruin it
We gon make it or we gon take it
Respect is everything so please don't break it
If you still in the hood and ya rent is due
I wrote this song for you (for you)

[Chorus]

(Sheek)
I just party and bs like B.I said
Old school keep a hundred stacks under the bed
With the time red six hundred call it a sled
Little yak little greenery to clear my head
But you gotta keep pushin you gotta keep whippin
The landlord callin the baby sitter is flippin
You ready to drop everythin you think about skippin
But you strong and you gon make it all good
Back to the wall and you gon keep it all hood
Put ya drinks up 5 cent cups
Ace of spades whatever I don't give (a give a)
If ya rents due I wrote this song for you

[Chorus]

(Sheek)
Unh pay day is here eventhough there's nothing's left
The clubs packed everybody is fresh to def
New swag I'm confident that you can bag her
Gas in the tank, can I buy you a drink
The music all loud, she dancin' all wild
Can't tell me shorty ain't the hottest in the crowd

[Chorus]</pre>
