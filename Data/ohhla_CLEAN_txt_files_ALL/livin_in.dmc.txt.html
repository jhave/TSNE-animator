c-c-livin in the ci-tayyyy!

[Run-D.M.C.]	The ci..

c, ci-c, ci-c-c-c-c-ci-tayyyy!

[D.M.C.]
From the city, although it ain't pretty
And times gettin down to the nitty gritty
The city busy, traffic tragic
Magic graphic ain't nuttin to laugh at
Poverty, robbery, larceny
Problems to me so don't bother me
with the drugs thugs I ain't got no time for that
I'm too busy tryin to get another brother's, pockets fat
Stay the fuck in school, cool learn the rule
Knowledge to fuel the brain the tool
I kick info just to let you know
the rhyme gonna show you how far you can go
in the city

L-li-li-la-li, li-li-livin in the ci-tayyyy!
The ci-tayyyy!
