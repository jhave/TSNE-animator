(Jamo)
You ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes
I can tell you want to fuck

(Mercedes)
And you ain't gotta call me ya boo
Just as bad as you wanna fuck
I wanna fuck too

(Jamo)
No, No, No you ain't gotta say to much 
From the look in your eyes
I can tell you wanna fuck

(Mercedes)
And you ain't gotta call me ya boo
Just as bad as you wanna fuck
I wanna fuck too

(Mac)
Now you ain't gotta say much cuz I was peepin you
Lookin at yo hips got me thinkin bout how deep
In you um tryin to go
You heard about No Limit Soldiers?
We get up in it and hit it harder then De La Hoya
I thought I told you soldier draws
Cover my balls, Um known for rippin the pussy walls
I heard you got that kill
I can see all in yo grill
Can you ride me like a black Mercedes?
And make me do that shit I never did with other ladies?
I got a woman so i'm not lookin for love
I just wanna fit yo glove
Get a couple of uh-uh's 
Shove it in your mouth just like a thug
And uh, hit me on my pager if you want it
Its soldier passion
So get up on it if you want it WHOA-WHOA!!!!

(Beginning of Chorus)-(Jamo)
You ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes 
I can tell you wanna fuck

(Mercedes)
And you ain't gotta call me ya boo
Just as bad as you wanna fuck
I wanna fuck too

(Jamo)
No, No, No you ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes
I can tell you wanna fuck

(End of Chorus-Mercedes)
And you ain't gotta call me ya boo
Just as bad as you wanna fuck
I wanna fuck too

(Mercedes)
Put me on the counter in the kitchen 
Now baby pour my body with some ice cream
Lick me from head to toe
Bending me over
69'll be the next thing
I wanna taste your body all night long
From sun up to sun down I wanna make you moan

(Beginning of Chorus-Jamo)
You ain't gotta say too much 
From the look in your eyes
I can tell you wanna fuck

(Mercedes)
And you ain't gotta call me ya boo
Just as bad as you wanna fuck
I wanna fuck too

(Jamo)
No, No, No you ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes
I can tell you wanna fuck

(End of Chorus-Mercedes)
And you ain't gotta call me ya boo
Just as bad as you wanna fuck
I wanna fuck too

(Jamo)
Can I light a candle?
And kiss you in the places light won't show
I'll take my time and do it slow
I'll do my oral exercises
Right between your thighs
It's all very pleasurable, I'll go places he won't go
Lets keep it on the low-low
So he won't know
Now lets take it to the floor

(Beginning of Chorus-Jamo)
You ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes
I can tell you wanna fuck

(Mercedes)
And you ain't gotta call me ya boo
Just as bad as you wanna fuck
I wanna fuck too

(Jamo)
No, No, No you ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes
I can tell you wanna fuck

(End of Chorus-Mercedes)
And you ain't gotta call me ya boo
Just as bad as you wanna fuck
I wanna fuck too</pre>
