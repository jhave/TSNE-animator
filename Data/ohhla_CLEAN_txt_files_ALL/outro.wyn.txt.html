[Bun B]
Yeah...when I step in the spot, motherfuckers say, "Who that?"
Big Bun Beater, but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin on the trill OG, where they do that? (for real!)
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix man, just go' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand, with no easy fix man (damn!)
No tricks man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar, and hoes in the crib
Drank and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin with PA so you know what it is (what it is)
I'm sittin on the fours that clack
Comin down candy in the golden Lac
We gettin to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
And we do it for the pimps that are holding back, let's go! {*echoes*}

[Nas]
Look who crept in with automatic weapons, reppin QB till the death of him
That...nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em
Track record goes back to The Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man, attested
I pass it, you gaspin for breath and you die fast
But I'm like a gastronomic bypass
Bunch of Nas advocates, actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since sixteen I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow, cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit, I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon, fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden, I was real young, look at youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected, chowed down now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are techs, bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin... testin
Chop heads off like King Henry the Eighth, guillotine to ya neck bitch~!
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggaz can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is +sealed+, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin dude, studied cowards that made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food, you can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggaz
And yo my nigga Wayne - let them niggaz hate
And like my nigga Drake say, "We ain't got time to respond to niggaz"

[Shyne]
I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin over Gotham
Word to Poppa {*echoes*}
Bl-bl-blood gang, five! It's that Blood gang, five, but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain't gon' fight
They actin like they ain't gon' die until I let them llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed, do or die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it's no place for a juvenile
Greed in our heart, it's the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss! {*echoes*}

[Busta Rhymes]
They say I'm underrated (uh huh), but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me? Unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That's when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin
"There he goes again!"
See now they nominated a nigga to come and flatten everything
Now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin that I be blackin on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake em when I come and shake em
And bake em and take em to another place
Ain't no fakin, ain't no kind of mistakin how I be breakin up
Everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (damn!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity snitch!
Most of you niggaz sorry and owe apologies quick
What the fuck you niggaz still hangin'around here for? You apostrophe bitch! {*laughs*}
Okay, now enough of that, see now I'm out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole nother classic with Tha Carter IV {*echoes*}</pre>
