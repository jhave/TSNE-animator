[Shock G (x2)]
She used to be quick to lick, the trick
But now she just wanna rub em down

[Digital Underground]
Body-hats, lookin for the Body-Hats
Lookin for the body-hats! (x6)

[Shock G]
Yeah, I took sugar shoppin (yo?) for a body-hat (no!)
And I found a pack of big blue round ones
The can't-shut-me-down ones, yeah
A-rigga-like-me-needin-em-cause-I-get-around ones

[Humpty-Hump]
Yeah, well here we go, on another show
Backstage, shnuckas wanna get into the flow
My woody says yo! He's ready to go
But, yo, he's gotta wait for the Nose to go

[Money B]
A pretty face and back character
Maybe cause the chick is brainwashed
Lost, got your green contacts look fine
Who'd a thought you need hats for your eyes

[Saafir]
[???] around my eyes when I'm rhyming
The government says you've got to have a glow
And I swing a tail like Haley's Comet
No comment? I didn't think so
I thought flow and there it was

[Humpty-Hump]
It's just a freestills, meanwills keep the vills kills in
Sweat drills in, girlies in the wheels eatin chills and
You say you're ready to go? Oh no
You gotta wait for the Nose to go!

[Shock G]
Don't wanna throw a hot booty seven and lose
So what is the move to keep livin?
Swimmin in the big balloon, I don't think so
I ran a body-hat option on the ho

[Shock G]
She said lately it just ain't been the same
So would you kinda just rub me down?

[Humpty-Hump]
My woody wants to get into the flow
But I said no, you gotta wait for the Nose to go

[Shock G]
Baby really must've been crazy though
Cause the onion was big and round
