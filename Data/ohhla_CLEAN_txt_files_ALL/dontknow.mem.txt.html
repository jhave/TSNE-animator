[Chorus]
I don't know when the time will be
Which side of me whom you might see
Be careful what you ask for
That's no lie, sometimes we just don't know why
 
[Abstract Rude]
Yo, why do I do it like I do?
How come I don't get into trouble like I used to?
Why am I the last thing a girl understands?
I'm just like the rest trying to get inside the pants
Why don't I go and blow half the advance?
Buy a couple cars and my moms a mini-van
How come all I want to do is make beats?
And eat like a pig, eating anything with cheese
How come I don't talk about emcees?
I don't talk about much anyway, see?
Ain't a lot to say when you said it all before
So I'mma let the homies come and tell you 'bout some more
 
Chorus 2X
 
[Prevail]
No need for introductions
Mention the relentless
Why does my flow compare to those swinging wrenches?
Why do I believe that you control your own destiny?
Why wreck like cyclone, my voice tone a symphony?
Grind down the bones and separate the ligaments
Why do I demonstrate how you can die from ignorance?
It's like drifting through the Twilight Zone
I'mma highlight the parts I think you should be shown
Why you want to know how darkness feels?
I'll split your carcass in two parts like you ain't real
I'm beyond this--the largest, and grandest scale
Yo, my target, my hand though, is steady as hell
I _prevail_ on scales like Beethoven
The mic in my hand conducts the same motion
Why do I slice precise like Jack the Ripper
Triple round, dressed in black and slash you quicker
 
Chorus 2X
 
[Mad Child]
How come I don't use soap?
Sit in the bath with a cup of coffee, have a couple of smokes
I don't know any jokes
Although I heard a ton of em, I can't remember none of them
How come every time I hang out with my friends I make fun of them?
Hate the way I act when I'm drunk but I drink
??And sense of the invention?? tension, I don't think
You couldn't benchpress my stress: shit weighs a ton
You couldn't shock me with a taser gun
Nothing surprise me; my whole tribe's lively
Got anger and confusion standing right beside me
It's why when I'm alone at home I'm not lonely
Please do not drop by, do not phone me
Might be crazy, but at least I'm not phony
How come I don't follow trends? Got my own vision
How come I don't try to talk to myself? I won't listen
Why have I absorbed this morbid war torpid?
I can't let go of the pain, torture, torment
As sure as I'm a muralist and nonconformist
Love God but raise hell with the hot performance
 
Chorus 2X</pre>
