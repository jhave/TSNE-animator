[Eve: Verse 1]
Uh
Sick when she rock shit, stop when block shit
Never try to run when she pull back the cock shit
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop shit
Got 'em goin' crazy, wonderin' when they could cop shit
First lady, Ruff Ryder, honey got the hot shit
Star-bound, money now, for jet-black drop shit
Eve guarantee, betcha' niggaz wanna pop this
Little kids be behind me screamin' out, "Can you stop miss?!!"
I know they daddy's fiendin', daydreamin' bout me topless
Real bitches listen while they ride around and knock my shit
Try not to move ya head, come on now, stop it
Hustle nigga betty take yours quicker than coke profit
'Cuz I can double it, and put
Bitch on bitch, brick on brick, stich on stich, who you fuckin wit?
Not me, can't a nigga or bitch stop me
You hatin' mothafuckas line up for your first copy

[Chorus]
[Nokio]
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH
Role it up and just lite some, UHH
Where my niggaz with the big guns?
And when you smoke that shit it's like, "WHOA!!WHOA!!"
[Eve]
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH
Role it up and just lite some, UHH
Where my niggaz that take ones?
'Cuz when we smoke that shit it's like "WHOA!!WHOA!!"

[Verse 2: Eve]
Uh, yo
Start the beef, hold up, ran when we roled up
Tough guy, wanna try ya luck? Betcha' fold up
Ask around partner, got this whole shit sewed up
Gotcha' cryin' like, "Man I wanna blow up!!"
Cowards make me sick, swere to god I wanna throw-up
Answer in a session with me? You better flow tough
Offended? Don't agree with what i'm sayin' nigga? So what?
Now I gotta teach you respect, you better slow up
Question, 'Can she really hold it down?' (sure enough)
Philly's where she from, but when she smoke, she like to go Dutch
You know what? Quick to take the next man shyne
Quick to make him start bitchin' make the next man whine
Fuckin babies!! Go ahead and lay down, it's nap-time
Same shit you spittin', heard it in your last rhyme
Ain't to much thatchu' could do, so that'chure skills could pass mine
Car eer fineto, here's some dough, go watch a peep show

[Chorus]
[Nokio]
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH
Role it up and just lite some, UHH
Where my niggaz with the big guns?
And when you smoke that shit it's like, "WHOA!!WHOA!!"
[Eve]
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH
Role it up and just lite some, UHH
Where my niggaz that take ones?
'Cuz when we smoke that shit it's like "WHOA!!WHOA!!"


[Verse 3: Eve]
What me to talk crazy, shit,  my moms made me
And all ya'll niggas can do is *???spend a paybie???*
Ain't  gonna never change, do anything for bricks
Call my celly to come get you while I pass you in your Range
Nigga ride ya shotgun in the car wit' your friends
And what the fuck you wanna do? But wanna blow out your brains?
Clown, I spot 'em from the time you buy me a drink
Instantly I get a vision of diamond studded links, and full ink minks
And little doggies dyed pink
'Cuz I know ya wanna spend your last, before you even think
If you know somethin', speak the shit, I can keep a secret
To me, the niggas with the most money, is the cheapest
Wanna give me money off the book? Daddy you can keep it
That's why they got the most sites, and in the most fights
And walk with big brolic niggas thats protectin' they life
If you know you pussy nigga, take off the ice

[Chorus]
[Nokio]
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH
Role it up and just lite some, UHH
Where my niggaz with the big guns?
And when you smoke that shit it's like, "WHOA!!WHOA!!"
[Eve]
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH
Role it up and just lite some, UHH
Where my niggaz that take ones?
'Cuz when we smoke that shit it's like "WHOA!!WHOA!!"</pre>
