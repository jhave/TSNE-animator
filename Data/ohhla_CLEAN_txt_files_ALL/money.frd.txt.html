Song:   Money
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Without money, what would we do?
We've got our little idea to see what's going on
Listen! Money is the root of all evil
But ain't nothing evil about money!
I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got money!

[Verse 1]
I need a great sex
Balling, might see me with Steven A. Smith
Picture me working the day shift
Making minimal wage, man I couldn't pay shit
Nigga I got bills, I turn 40 to 80, I got skills
You push this rocking where we work
Miami Cuban over the Rocko wearing shirt
Then it's the match, nigga I just painted the stack
Depending if I'm offended, die when I finish this rap
Now where the bread at? That's where Fred's at
Double XL freshman it's special A rap
Strip club chain I'm in,
You're the president in the end!
Stripper's singing, "It's raining men"
Look son, bro, walk 'em out, dummy!
My name Fred the God, and we're talking about it!

[Chorus]
Money, money, money, money
I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got
Money, money, money, money
I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got
Money, money, money, money

[Verse 2]
Beamer pocket, then I get on a carpet
She's sexy like a dina
She's leaning and leaving markets
I'm showing you I'm the best
We're you not local?
They tell you American Express
Next king of New York know I'm a clear shot
She never seen a half a man spent on a brazier top
I'm standing here, watch!
Been born since Mike Jackson still doing the ten drop
Now I'm sitting on the yacht seat
Couple old school niggas be playing yachtze
White linen, seen her killed in autopsies
Make more than you off of coke spots and oxies
Sick Cuban, Jesus piece flooded,
Russell Simmonds seen it and thought it was Rick Ruben
And now labels know the flow was real
Like how I dress it up, now let's close the deal!

[Chorus]
Money, money, money, money
I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got
Money, money, money, money
I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got
Money</pre>
