[Intro: 50 Cent]
Hey what's up man? It's the kid 50 Cent man
New Gangsta Grillz, "Lost Tape" man
I made this joint man, made me sick man
Doctor came in and said man "You got germs man
You got germs from touchin too much motherfuckin money BITCH!"
We gettin ready to get it goin
Don't you ever forget it nigga
I'm the reason why you make a mixtape, sucka

[Eminem]
Aiyyo Fif', I was thinkin
You should go back to doin the shit you used to do

[50 Cent]
Murder dem, murder dem
They violate I demonstrate, yeah I'll murder dem

{"Gangsta Grizzillz!"}

[Eminem]
Aiyyo Fif', I was thinkin
You should go back to doin the shit you used to do

[50 Cent]
Murder dem, murder dem
They violate I demonstrate, yeah I'll murder dem
Niggaz be frontin, word up, they stuntin 'til they hurt up
Their semi talk, I'll let it buck, I'll have these niggaz runnin hard
I'll pull a nigga's skirt up then have him kickin dirt up
I'll get a nigga, hit a nigga back up stupid hard
Silence, it's the return of the tyrant
See him through my third eye with both closed eyelids
Stand closer to the homie you wan' die with
Flames come up out the muzzle on the shit that I spit
Get murked! I'm talkin like the Feds ain't listenin
Nigga this a pool of piranhas you fishin in
I'll give it to a nigga if he want it
Better ask niggaz 'bout me, I'll be on it
I get the drop, blow at your knot, perfect plannin
Hit your back with somethin hot, out the cannon

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
It's murder one (one)
It's premeditated - murder
Then it's another one (one)
Back to back put work in

[50 Cent]
You know I ain't got the strap on me
Bar holdin that for me
I'm fucked up, it really doesn't matter though
100 9-millimeter shells in the Calico
Wait, niggaz drop like dominoes
Run for your life puta, s, v°monos
I was taught to treat my crew a long time ago
Grew up around cocaine, yeah, even my momma know
I cut a O in the fo' with seven at a time
Make 400 off that, you know a nigga grind
Like Cyndi Lauper bitch, +Time After Time+
A nigga shine, like a nickel-9
I been talkin to the man in the mirror
Niggaz so ass they be shakin like Shakira
It seems like my vision's gettin clearer
See me comin with the hammer out, death is gettin near ya
It's funny how niggaz never hear ya
'til ya run down on 'em; gun down on 'em

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, startin to feel like the old me!
Ha ha
