(Chorus)
[Iconz]{Lil' Kim}
If you smoke weed now {uh}
In this bitch hit you all wanna clown {uh huh}
Got a drink that you cant put down {uh, uh!}
When a fight, will the shit go down
Get fucked up, (get fucked up)
Get fucked up, (get fucked up)
Get fucked up, (get fucked up)
Get fucked up, (get fucked up)

When see ?stable? cloudy scenary
I'm high off greenery
It could be in a VIP sippin' Hennessey
With the trick rollin' exstacy
Y'all know how these Iconz roll, Iconz flow
Drop the system, stay hot like whoa
We sure y'all know how we puttin' it down
Iconz in the house I'mma shut shit down!

Yeah, shut the shit down
Time to switch now
Crys in the glass to sip now
X5, superstar, the Icon mamma
Stepped out, tanked out and let's dada
That's when I come with, run with
Iconz clique, fly bomb shit
For all my girls who be shakin' they ass
Spendin' the cash, y'all keep sippin' on now, wha (hey)

(Chorus)
[Iconz]{Lil' Kim}
If you smoke weed now {uh}
In this bitch hit you all wanna clown {uh, uh}
Got a drink that you cant put down {uh huh}
When a fight, will the shit go down {uh, uh, the REMIX}
Get fucked up, (bitches get fucked up)
Get fucked up, (niggas get fucked up)
Get fucked up, (c'mon get fucked up)
Get fucked up, (everybody get fucked up)

[Lil' Kim]
Everybody talk fly, but ain't go no plane
See me at the front row at the Knick's game
Fuck smoking blunts, I take bones to the brain
BLOAW! Nig, I got a good-ass aim
Nobody get rich without me, now or never
Whatever, you niggas need to get it together
Icon, Queen Bee, so respect the game
This shit right here made off the chain
I'm just a fly girl
Always rocking thongs with the see-through stockings
Gators with the Lizzies
Burners for the dead beats
WHA?! Mafia, yeah we comin for all, comin for y'all
That's right, I got something for y'all
What you drinkin'? Me? I'm drunk off Bacardi
Oh shit, let's crunk up the party
 From New York on the way to Miami
Everybody get fucked up, break it down now, BLOAW!

(Chorus)
[Iconz]
If you smoke weed now (come on)
In this bitch hit you all wanna clown
Got a drink that you cant put down
When a fight, will the shit go down
Get fucked up, (get fucked up, niggas)
Get fucked up, (get fucked up, niggas)
Get fucked up, (get fucked up)
Get fucked up, (get fucked up)

Iconz, Queen Bitch, South dawg to dawn
South Dade to Brook-lawn
Pop ya Crys and Don
I'm higher gone
With sexy hoes flexin' thong
Got five pounds of jewels round my neck and arm (huh!)
Whole clique dime and dub
You have the time
Y2K, your time is up
You prolly, find your sluts spendin' time with us
In the hotel sippin little ?Grineda?

Yeah, yeah, thugs in the MI
Thugs, real dub, big ballin' in the MI
Ladies shakin' their money, makin' more doe

We made number on the first drop, playa

(Come on!) We get you fucked up baby
We make you smilin' baby
New ? Iconz we made it
Right clique got this whole world shakin' (yeah! yeah!)

If you smoke weed now
In this bitch hit you all wanna clown
Got a drink that you cant put down
When a fight, will the shit go down
Get fucked up, (get fucked up, niggas)
Get fucked up, (get fucked up, niggas)
Get fucked up, (get fucked up)
Get fucked up, (get fucked up)
Get fucked up, (bitches get fucked up)
