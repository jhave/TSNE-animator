[HAVOC]
Like Shaq
Hav and Prod's back for the Tec
Still puttin' down on wax
Mess up
Against any of you busters
Flash dance
For your ass like Custer
You should to trust us
Because where we from
You gotta be capable of murder

[PRODEJE]
Dippin' 1-0 way in my E-X-P
On my way to pick up Havoc cause he's waiting for me
Blue chrome in my stash as I'm mashin' the gas
I see a 64 swoop and they fin' to smash
Why they trippin' upon Prodeje? Why they bringin' the funk?
Hav is parking his Suburban and shit ready to jump
He sees this drama
He ain't slippin' cause he packin' his heat
I hit the brakes, jump out the truck and make a dash for a trip
The '4 dropped - five brothers jumped out
They be heated
5 semi-automatics with the aim for the ??
I hit behind
They finna to send me to my maker
The one of the brothers know this was the Prod O.G.
What you're trippin' on homie, Havoc into the set
Knowin' good down well it could end up wet
They said we took 'em for this buster, we was settin' to kill
Or we mistook the homie Prod y'all niggas keep shit real
I said damn 10 seconds from a six feet hole
Growin' up in South Central, Loc it's hard on the soul

[PRODEJE]
Now you're trippin' only gets so far
I got the infra-red heater
And I'm about to blow shit down
Don't make me act to break your ass like day
Don't make a nigga have to spray
And make you have a fucked up day
Now you're trippin' only gets so far
I got the infra-red heater
And I'm about to blow shit down

[PRODEJE]
It was
Just the close car, Havoc call me we don't sweat 'em
Park the 80 ??? Suburban and we sailin'
You have to swoop to Venice cause it's sunday and it's crackin'
Stash the two heaters then it's off to do some mackin'
He fired up the endo weed
I let 'em breath
I hit the third roll was startin' to count with my G's
When you're broke your homies love you when you paid there tight
The playa haters get to trippin' when they enter your sight
Hit the beach, parked the big Bird - turned the corner
Just see what kinda love we can get in California
Gangstas don't dance but we boogie
Today my player's more takin' over though my hoodie's at home
And it's on
Who in it the zone for feelin' somethin' in my bones
(What's up baby? Can I take you home?)
Five seconds then I pulls her up
He gets to trippin'
I tell this fool, he gone before it gets his ass whippin' (that's real)
A baby father's brother homie
So what he run it
And just a few seconds I'm about to start gunnin'
Havoc tells me get the step in cause this hoe ain't shit
You wanna lose your damn freedom for a broke-ass trick? (hell no!)
I understand that so I checks this fool and gets the mobbin'
And fools got a problem I'm down for problem solver

[HAVOC]
Like Flavor Flav
Mouht Piece has skill will never demand it
Only get back like Denny Menaces
Me and my partner Prod
Who's ready to seek and destroy
To blast to equal four mark
Who done fucked up some shit
And pissed me off
Because you thought I was soft
But now
I will kill your ass at all call

[PRODEJE]
We got a couple of honeys numbers then we's off for the set
On our way to L.C. to laid back for a sec (fool!)
Havoc told me about some bustas tryin' to rain on this shit
Playa hatin' muthafuckas tryin' to gaffle his grip
They hit his crib when he was solo four deep on the proud
Tryin' to clean a homie out the situation was foul
Four niggas strapped with heaters couldn't handle it G
They didn't get a damn thing, yeah you know who you be
Make your own money makers all that bitch in his hole
We love to catch you on the corner and retail your soul
Cause we blast if we have to fools, don't get it twisted
You've seen that blue chrome right before you're ass kissin'
Can't exist it, you desire for ends, it's gettin' deeper
But trippin' on my homie makes me get the street sweeper
Where the heat seeker infra-red
As I blast only take ten seconds to retail your ass, fool

[PRODEJE]
Now you're trippin' only gets so far
I got the infra-red heater
And I'm about to blow shit down
Don't make me act to break your ass like day
Don't make a nigga have to spray
And make you have a fucked up day...

[HAVOC]
Ahahahaha
Yes
It is me and motherfuckin' Prodeje
Back in the motherfuckin' studio
And this is the last motherfuckin' song we did done
Shine, you get a motherfuckin' good job, you know what I'm sayin'
I hope this shit is goin' platinum
I wanna give a big shout out to that nigga Bob
Who put down them dope platinum track
And all the rest of the people who didn't participated
1-Nutt, Young Prod
And all of the rest of the muthafuckas who did put down for dope shit
Yeah
Truez Neva motherfucking Stop! </pre>
