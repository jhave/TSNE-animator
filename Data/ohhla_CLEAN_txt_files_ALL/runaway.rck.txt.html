Well, I waited long time sweatin it
Gettin jerked but yea I'm gettin it
Early mornin, stiff as dawn and 'em, cuz a brother give the mornin off
And then we doin in, paranoid to new swearin
I said meet me in the lobby skip
So one could cut down on the cherry tip
Alright, he flyin scat, to being fair to show a mighty that
La Di Da Di wanted Gotti and although depended on the body and
Who I know was gonna runaway, am I to live to serve the next day
When I know she's gonna be wit him, so hallelujah, praise God King

Checked it out, even candle light I figured out
better handle it my nigga, in
I think the best thing is to block her out
cuz she doesn't give a fuck about
So much change and true it in, you would of cared to wish the u-nion
She's not a phony, turn the Sony off, you better overcome the lonely of
Although a brother lettin that, thus don't know where I'm headin at
To see, even though we fought of it
by bother just the very thought of it
When I know she's gonna runaway, am I to live to serve the next day
When I know she's gonna be wit him, so hallelujah, praise God King
And I know you're gonna runaway, am I to live to serve the next day
When I know you gonna be wit him, can't belive that this is happenin

Well, I should say fine and phone wit coin
but though you say that I'm the only one
What, behind my back thinkin of, or father not the one I'm thinkin of
On this stress, and when it's gonna end
down wit this burden here I'm wonderin
I know I should say fine fed it yea
and think about all the girls ahead of ya
Though hard for me to just forget he
and try to follow to the letter end
Although the terrible things we riff about
or follow wise that I can live it out
When I know you're gonna runaway, am I to live to serve the next day
When I know you gonna be wit him, so hallelujah, praise God King
When I know you're gonna runaway, am I to live to serve the next day
When I know you gonna be wit him, can't believe this is happenin
I know you're gonna runaway, I know you're gonna be wit him
Seems I know you're gonna runaway, I know you're gonna be wit him
Can't believe this is happenin</pre>
