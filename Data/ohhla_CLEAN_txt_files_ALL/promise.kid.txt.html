[hook] 
Tell me that you love me 
Promise me you'll never leave me 
I know I'm not the only one 
I know your running games 
Tell me that you need me 
Promise me you'll never leave me 
I know I'm not the only one 
I know your runnin games 

My girl checking my neck, smelling my clothes 
And checking my pager, asking if I hate her 
Somebody said that I'm a player 
And they got videos from out Vegas 
At the house of blue, with two bitchs in my room 
Now she wanna sing that tune, she said she's leaving 
She said I won't be seeing her soon 
Stormed out the room, then came back 
You know all girls do, anything with degree 
She's flying at you, slapping at you 
Rest at chits, somebody's lying 
Don't believe the rumors you hear, you know how I deal 
You know i steal, and die with you, first one to hit you 
And still with you, stuck to it, you name it, I put it through it 
Said she would've left me, way back but couldn't do it 
The truth is, the bitch is running they mouth 
But i don't know what they talk bout 
Straight up girl, I promise

hook 

Girl what you in it for, you tell me I've changed 
You tell that I caught up in my selfish ways 
Take it back to the day, when me and you meet
You was playing hard to get cause all i wanted was sex 
She let me get up in it, cause we feelings inside 
We went from lust to a trust, now she thinks that I'm lying 
I'm just trying to make it best of us 
She was just jealous of a girl 
In the club, when she was dancing right next to us 
Killer swap tried to step to her but she was jocking 
Acting like I all ready crepted with her 
Now do you want this just as bad as I 
Criticized by your friends cause your man's living the rap life 
Sometimes it's so hard satisfy 
Got every one around you what kind of man I'm I 
You'd promised me you'll never leave 
Doesn't mean your gonna keep it no secret 
No she promise me you'll keep it real 

hook 

Now if you don't mind me asking 
Why do you always thinking that I'm cheating 
And just because I'm a rapper not's a reason 
Yeah I'm always leaving even get to call you on the weekend 
Telling me you I never hear you speaking 
Always trying to find me when I'm sleeping 
Going through the Lincoln 
Creeping, swerving at you gonna catch me Snipping, 
You Tripping listen to your daddy, baby doll 
Yeah is hard, but you just gotta listen to your heart 
When I'm lost, feeling like my life's falling apart 
Who's the one that treats me like star 
Far from home but you the one holding the loot 
Holding the gun hoping I'm gone holding it down 
You should know by now ain't no messing around 
Baby I promise you now it ain't the way I get down 
Girl I promise 

hook till end </pre>
