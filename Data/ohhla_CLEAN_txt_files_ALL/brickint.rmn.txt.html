[Redman]
Bricks is ugly! Roll ya blunts up, with the '89
Bricks is partying, dub drop 80 bombs
Gilla House here, we bout to dumb out
Hittin' your halfway house to break (?) out
It's a lot of gangsters and a lot of freaks
That turn any street beef into potted meat
From Chilltown, Illtown, to New Brunswick!
I bring it back like your day of first tounge kiss
Picture looking good, all two of y'all
You wanna fuck bitches? Let's get it on!
I'm like Marvin Gaye, I'm still starvin'
Crash my car where Garden State Mall is
Took the jewlery, minx, and the cashmere
Roll up in Macy's, smack the cashier
I know you like it hot, that's why I keep it hot
So how the fuck, could you not want a piece of Doc?

[Chorus]
We don't give a fuck, cause we just drink and smoke and straight East Coastin'
Bitches, shakin', ass in motion, psycho, outlaw, smoker, strokin'
Got a cup? Raise it up! Got a blunt? Blaze it up!
That's yo chick? What's yo chick? On these nuts!
All I really know is that Gilla House is some crazy niggaz
We ain't playin', know what I'm sayin'? (Shout out to Dr.Dre!)

[Redman]
Yo, soon as the club close
I'm at the back do' strapped wit' a Haxso, and a Fo' Five
My niggaz gassed up, quick to blast up, similar to NASA
Got chickens in the Bricks with they ass up
Thugs on the block tryin' to get after us
What'd you think nigga? I ain't come prepared?
With a big bear grip in my underwear
Hit 'em up, shoot 'em up, head 'em out
Y'all had your turn, Red is up
Don't be shy now, we hustle thick at it
You know a party ain't a party 'less Bricks at it
Get a mic to the Doc and I'll get it crackin'
Y'all lose focus, we keep stackin'
Def Sqaud in it, Erick snuck the Mac in
Keith Murray in the back, chain jackin' (x4)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, it's Gilla House niggaz
Comin through the do' fo '04
Better beleive that
We told you!
Get yo smoke on nigga, Gilla House niggaz</pre>
