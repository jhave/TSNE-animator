Song:   Release The Tension
Typed by: magoousher@aol.com

Im the best and thats B and thats capital
I hang low like testicles
MCs when it come to these men who flow
Hoes, better back up
Fo they get slapped up
Pack up and go tell mommy
That Im back up
You, you, you, you and your whole crew
Whatcha whatcha whatcha gone do 
To me, thats M-I-double S-Y E
When its back to me
Its gonna be some tragedy

[Verse One]
Mmmm
Whats your name 
Cause youve got me
You wanna know
What it be like
What the deal is
Where my man at
Can you get with me
You say you got the things that I need
Whats your name
Cause youve got me
You wanna know 
Who I roll with
Who I be with
Who Im down with
Do I like to do the nasty things that you do 

[CHORUS]
Release some tension
Break for, break for intermission
For me and you, you start the kissing
Youll see what youve been missing
Release some, some of your tension
Break for intermission
For me and you, you start the kissing
Youll see what youve been missing

[VERSE TWO]
Mmmmm
Youre so fine
I wanna make you mine
I wanna know
Can I be with you
Can you be with me
On the count of three
Me and you gonna get romantically
Youre so file
I wanna make you mine 
I wanna know
Do you got a girl
Is she good to you
I bet she wont do the things that Ill do to you

[Repeat CHORUS]

[Rap]
Uh huh
I be creeping and creeping
With my peoples, my peoples
With my homies, my homies
We be smoking that reefer
Trying to get (my) knees high
Trying to get (my) knees high
So I hit em with a broken bang (pop-pop)
Turn me up a notch 
Neighbors wanna call the cops
They cant stand to see me rock
Every house is on the block
Nigga knock
Dont stop
Nig-nig-nigga knock 

[Repeat CHORUS]
