[Mystikal]
Ow, good God
(I'm down at the club, y'all, yeah)
Boogie down baby (Move ya)
Shake what ya mama made
I see by how you movin'
You could take it, take it, take it
Hips don't lie, her booty be talkin'
Grip your thighs
We ain't gon' let no big fat woman come pump us
We gon' get so bodacious and rambunctious
Get down baby, don't let nothin' hold ya back
Daddy movin' in, I'm 'bout to close the jam

[Gerald]
I'm on fire 
When you're moving that thing at me
Got me burnin'
I need your body up close to me
My emotions 
Got me feelin' real freakily 
Don't be nervous
I'm gonna whoop ya like it's s'pose to be, baby

1 - 	Do you wanna party baby
	Shakin' what yo' mama gave ya
	Just wanna dance, I wanna dance
	Don't cha be ashamed to back that thing up
	It's too much room (It's scandalous)
	Too much, too much room babe, babe

2 - 	There's too much room up in here
	Put your hand a little closer babe 
	So you can feel me shake it
	Yeah, yeah, come on babe
	Baby, but you can handle it, it's scandalous

	There's too much room up in here
	Put your hand a little closer babe
	So you can feel me shake it
	Yeah, yeah, come on babe
	Baby, but you can handle it, it's scandalous

You give me a fever
Cuz I'm runnin' like a rent-it sign
Ain't no reason
We can't do it to new styles
Can't you feel me
And you know that it's gettin' hard 
To control it
Baby girl, I'mma have to call the cops
Come on, babe

Repeat 1
Repeat 2
Repeat 2

Here we go, here we go now

[Mystikal]
Talk to me, Hello, what's that?
A duet with Mystikal and Gerald?
Hell yeah, yeah, you right fo' sure (Damn right)
Get on the flo', Electra Records
About as fire as a bottle with a jar of peppers
Bad motha fuckin' baboon
Cuz baby if I can't reach it
There's too much damn room

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

[Gerald]
Uh oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing it again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh, oh well, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back that thing up on the bed
And move it, I can take a big bed shakin'
My temperature's risin' and I feel your thighs bending
Don't deny, I can take it
It's too much room, all this room
Tellin' me not to be all over you babe
It's too much room, all this room
Tellin' me not to do all the things I wanna do baby
Yeah, get a little closer baby
Don't cha be ashamed</pre>
