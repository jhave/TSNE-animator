[Intro - Jadakiss] (Pharrell)
AH-HA! (hot sauce to go)
Light in the incense, backup
And turn the lights off in the motherfucker!
(Hot sauce to go) Right now! Please!
Thank you, muah!
Ahah-ha! (hot sauce to go)
You know who it is! (Jada)
The obvious is beautiful! (hot sauce to go)
Marlvelous, I'm getting older

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams] (w/ Jada ad-libs)
You got to move wit the groove
As she lay on the one's and two's
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You gon stink up the room!
Wit that big ol' ass!

[Verse - Jadakiss]
Yo, we gon hit something
I'm cutting the rug wit love
Or I'm on the wall pressed up against something
You should let em know the boss is back
So y'all niggas that went wood go get more shalack
I see bowlegs backing it in
I put it on her wit the ol' school two step, clap and a spin
Filled up her cup, slid her a dutch
You know what's happenin then (what?) in
And all I did was having a grin
Off top let her know I ain't one of these dudes
Rhyming to lose, naw ma I'm rapping to win
Yeah! yes! They know the God be fresh
I'm on that ass blowing purple on the washing set
And even though I came wit thugs
You still might catch a few of them 'Stepping In The Name Of Love'
Uh! It's D on the Block, the Ryde is Ruff
And you wit the motherfucking Billionaire Boys Club!

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams] (w/ Jada ad-libs)
You got to move wit the groove
As she lay on the one's and two's
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You gon stink up the room!
Wit that big ol' ass!
Would you go to jail, LIGHT ME UP!
Go to jail, LIGHT ME UP!
Would you go to jail, LIGHT ME UP!
Go to jail, LIGHT ME UP!
You got to move wit the groove
As she lay on the one's and two's
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You gon stink up the room!
Wit that big ol' ass!

[Verse - Jadakiss]
Gangsta leanin, Kiss be in the bank wit cream and
My wrists and my neck be gleamin
Whatever I got cost, Honey look hotter than Hot Sauce
That's why I get to hop in a drop Porsche
Then she get dropped off, told her that the whole block pop off
She come through, take them rocks off
And therefore, wanna know, what would they stare for
They heard about the work, it's as white as your Air Force
Maybe it's the voice that the world got an ear for
Most of these rappers, I just don't care for
So I be on the honies wit the big ol' asses
Hypno and Cleako in big ol' glasses
We could do the damn thang, order the champagne
Honey's Head of the State, and I'm running the Campaign
If you coming, c'mon, if not I'm gone
Other than that, yo Pharrell, sing my song!

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams] (w/ Jada ad-libs)
You got to move wit the groove
As she lay on the one's and two's
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You gon stink up the room!
Wit that big ol' ass!
Would you go to jail, LIGHT ME UP!
Go to jail, LIGHT ME UP!
Would you go to jail, LIGHT ME UP!
Go to jail, LIGHT ME UP!
Hot sauce to go.. hot sauce to go

[Verse - Jadakiss]
Hey yo, Honey got a goon thinking
That ass like that, she could have the room stinking
I - picked her up in the maroon Lincoln
Blew her back out until the moon sank in
Spend the profit, hold on the to the re
Lock me up, hold on the to key
I want you to wake up in the morning wit me
I got it bad for ya, breakfast and a cab for ya

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams] (w/ Jada ad-libs)
You got to move wit the groove
As she lay on the one's and two's
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You gon stink up the room!
Wit that big ol' ass!
Would you go to jail, LIGHT ME UP!
Go to jail, LIGHT ME UP!
Would you go to jail, LIGHT ME UP!
Go to jail, LIGHT ME UP!
Hot sauce watch out.. hot sauce to go
Hot sauce to go.. hot sauce to go</pre>
