[Sen Dog]
"(Inhales) Break that shit off nigga" 

[B-Real]
Look at all the M.C.'s trying to get down
But all you get is a peeled back, dome cap
I'm not the one to be having that shit
All these punk niggas better bow down and submit
Niggas don't know how to "keep it real"
Only if you niggas know the real deal
Fuck all the bullshit, Cypress Hill
Comes raining on your brain
Bringing the blood stains
Smeared on the sidewalk, one mark dome
of the prejudice skull, hanging in my home

"Straight to you dome sucker
 So what you wanna do fool"

[B-Real]
The Big Game hunter, fucking shit up
Get your ass back down, the Hill's on the cut
Who'll get in the circle, let's see if you're raw
Hardcore, last vato might hit the fucking floor
Glocks and ?, in them one clip
For any buster who wanna flip
Back ese ?, shining in your eye
Soul of an Assassin, until I die (Por vida ese!)
Red light visions in your dome piece
Nightmares running through your head, won't cease
Look at you now, broke down and done
No competition can ever get none

"Straight flip-flop, nigga, flip-flop
 on your punk ass until you drop 
 (Cypress Hill, coming at your grill)
 You're nothing but a motherfucking time clock
 Cypress motherfucking Hill
 (Fuck how you feel)
 It ain't but another piece to the puzzle fool!"</pre>
