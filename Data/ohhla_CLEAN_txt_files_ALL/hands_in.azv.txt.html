When the song come on hands in the air , (4x)

We surfaced consumer's pre-purchase
Guess who's back on the charts and he's nervous
Elite service, amongst men that beat murders
Fish-fillet lover, brother, don't eat burgers
Rap slowest, those that hold the gats know this
Biblical facts I'm about to re-enact Moses
Uh huh
Misery's back, I'm calligraphy on niggery tracks
Epidemy, it's seems like most consider me that, literally
It's like wizardry with me and the raps
And getting rid of me, somebody's insecurity lacks
Lucid, never biting or track boosting, it's too confusing
I supply what the fiends shooting
Front's is needed, I was once young and anemic
'Till I found a few players to team with

When the song come on hands in the air (4x)

I'm like the spring in a .45 colt pistol
Know the initials I gleam like a coke crystal
With most fickle, too serious to joke with you
Weak lungs was too laid-back to blow whistles
Far away and two cellphones with calls waiting
Parlaying two red-bones and I'm more patient
Spreeing on the form's fragrance
Leaving stores on every floor evermore vacant
We all chasing the thoughts of assort places
Bringing serenity back from all the court cases
And lost races, chose to expose little
Rap rugal, cockback smack your screw's loose
Axe Noodles rose amongst who ever
A Jewel tellers smooth fellas
Elders schooled me to do better

When the song come on hands in the air (4x)

O's kept, dice out, no bets
Lights out, I'm a Vet, y'all no threat
Piped out, something stretch, it's cold sex
Nice house, run around, in old sweats
Can't see me, don't try it, can't be me
Won't tire, y'all cowards can't leave me
Locked in, flow-wise I'm top ten
Hop in, low-ride, I'm not him
Hold heavy, it's hot, hope glow's ready
So deadly, this is not Hov' and Kelly
We hog tie 'em, nothing's plated, dark iron
The god's rhyming, thru the conduit the car's flying
Coke wit it, the doe did it, hoes get it
Unstable, still able to blow digits.
