Leave me all alone
There ain't nobody calling my telephone
Because I ripped that bitch right up out of the wall
I apologize to any or that tried to call
I haven't been myself lately
I've been slowly losing my mind and telling them it's gravy
I'm looking hella shady and I haven't showered in weeks
I haven't washed my balls, I haven't brushed my teeth
All I see is demons everywhere that I look
Was it the Ouija, the Black Magic warlock book
I can't remember, but how did my memories leave me
I can't believe the spirits would try to deceive me
But they did, just like a little kid
I was so eager to learn, so willing to give
But all they did was hate her and break me
Use my body for a host and my mirror for the gateway

Something is wrong with me, I can't be who I need to be
Something is wrong with me, will it last for eternity
Something is wrong with me, I can't be who I need to be
Something is wrong with me, will it last for eternity

Please don't walk away
I want you to hear what I got to say
I never had anyone ever care for me
I never had anyone ever there for me
If you would listen to me 'stead of calling me names
I would, I could explain why I'm shaking and going insane
My mind is on vacation, lack of conversation
I'm like a radio with static on every station
Still I wanna know, will I be normal again
You say it's bullshit and tell me that it's all pretend
But if it's false then why don't the demons just disappear
And if it's untrue then why am I seeing them crystal clear
Because I do, the mirror's turning blue
And soul after soul keeps walking right through
They're living in my house and living inside my head
Some sleep inside the closet, others sleep under the bed

Something is wrong with me, I can't be who I need to be
Something is wrong with me, will it last for eternity
Something is wrong with me, I can't be who I need to be
Something is wrong with me, will it last for eternity

Why don't they just leave me alone, will it last for eternity
Something wrong inside my head, I can't be alone
Why don't they just leave me alone, will it last for eternity
Something wrong inside my head, I can't be alone

Something is wrong with me, I can't be who I need to be
Something is wrong with me, will it last for eternity</pre>
