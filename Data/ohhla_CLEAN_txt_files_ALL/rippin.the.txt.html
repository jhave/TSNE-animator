Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yeah, Militia All-Star
??, first up
Me?  I'm Mr. Tan
Rippin' the Sounds, Organized Rhymes
Check it out

[Mr. Tan]
I make this scene here clear, I make this whole spot dissapear
You bustaz better recognize, I Quantum Leap, then reappear
Now fuck last year, cause this year, I'm Jones-in like Eddie
for the nation unknowin, it's on, you cowards ain't ready
for the terror, I run with tru soldiers and drug smugglers
that'll have you terrified, how we ride my nocca, fu'realla
Let's keep this shit classified and clarify the situation
Cause most these fools fakin, I'm takin niggaz down for hatin
See it's total concentration, I'm breakin the rules ??
And I bet the next time they recognize a real rap star
Switchin luxury cars, still just spinnin corners
Organizin Rhymes, and get in where I fit in, potnah hold up
You better show up, witcha gun out your holster
I roast you and your whole crew, I'm Mr. Tan and I done told you
we keep rippin, rippin the sounds
Organized Rhymes, straight puttin it down
We keep rippin, rippin the sounds
Organized Rhymes, straight puttin it down

[Ms. Toi]
Yeah..
Are we in sequence now?  C'mon, let me show you how
raw uncut Militia men really get down with that
precious jewel precise, Ms. Toi, cut close
for, perfect piece of ice, sparklin with gleam
Glistenin lookin mean, you try to come test I
make sure I strike you with the West
who's actually one of the best rippin this coast
My mommalicious styles keep hittin em low, rippin my shows
while I, straight get it get it, I warned you
in the beginnin-ginnin, now we straight winnin winnin
And our records be spinnin, worldwide
Where you gon' hide?  I rhymes, feelin good tonight
I blows minds for the most times, I shall climb
with these Organized Rhymes
And I'm rippin to make history this time
but I'm still hard to find, and I'm steady waxin to shine
(wax on.. wax off)

Chorus: Militia

Organized Rhymes keep rippin the sound
with the Militia, and we straight puttin it down
Organized Rhymes keep rippin the sound
with the Militia, and we straight puttin it down
Organized Rhymes keep rippin the sound
with the Militia, and we straight puttin it down
Organized Rhymes keep rippin the sound
with the Militia.. with the Militia..

[?]
Clear to circumfrence, seven CC's for heart pumpin
Lyrically dumpin, MC's ain't sayin nothin
They frontin, soft as a panda, propoganda
Bullshittin they buntin, I'm home run hittin
They fouled, fools is out of the game
Magnified picture, blown out of the frame
360 is 9 baby, equal to verb
Close the first two, proceed, open the third
Hutton, E.F., when illuminati speak
Infrared peep and seek your body heat
like Eraser, spark the spliff and uplift
Yeah shift, steady movin swift with the four-fifth
While all you actors get run over by tractors
The common factor, will use math to subtract you
Minus, my rhyme flows they be timeless
You're spineless, tell your boy to rewind this
Wherever I go, MC's catch heart attacks
Trails are found with fossils and artifacts
A variety of herbal, a garden like Eden
Get your first aid kit, my nia, you bleedin, WHAAAT?</pre>
