[Intro]
Fellas, last call, for alcohol
You better get what you drinking man
I am your main man DJ, EZ Dick
Share something real special with you
A brand new cut, from the big Boss Dogg
Featuring, Brandy, and Pharrell
Cause you're so special baby, yes you are

[Chorus: Brandy, Snoop, Pharrell]
[B] It's the way you
    It's the way, you, make me feeeeeel
[S] Special girl, you're so special, special
[B] Ooooh, baby just don't, change
    You're so reeeeeeal
[S] So special girl, you're so special, special
[B] Show me that I'm special, tell me boy
[P] Girl, you know you are special
    I bet you were born in the skyyyyy
[B] Show me that I'm special, tell me boy
[P] Girl, you know you are special
    Girl, the hottest in my mind

[Snoop Dogg]
I know you, and you know me
And this is the place that you really wan' be
Let's make it crack-a-lack, I make it look easy
Life can be a carnival and I'ma be your reason
Kiss, me, slow-ly
Perform +Quiet Storm+ 'til I get you nice-ly
I'm puttin out the blunt cause I see
that I need you more in my life than I need a bag of weed
Now I compare you to a bird when she fly by
I wanna rock you back to sleep like beddy-bye-bye
Bounce in the 'llac with your hand on my lap
Throw your bags in the back, I'ma show you where it's at
Ain't no tellin if we might come back, you like that?
I figured out a way to catch a flight right, back
See I ain't never flown for fees
Come spend a weekend overseas in Greece with me
Please believe!

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Snoop Dogg]
You know if you through with me, then I'm through with you
But you're the one who fell in love and said that love was true
But you ain't never fake on me
And now you think that you gon' find another G like me?
Them, niggaz, ain't gon' play
They gon' just hump, they ain't gon' do it your way
I can't hate and say what they gon' do
All I know is that I'm true and know that you my baby boo
Let's take a chance, go to France on a three-day cruise
Walk with your man in the sand like, oooh
It's our little rendezvous
Whoopty-whoop, Big Snoopy and boo
I picture this love affair, of ours
to last a lifetime, just like flowers
Take a quick flick then get dressed, we'll head to Brazil
I'll show you how it feel when you're rollin with the real
How it feel?

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Brandy + Snoop]
We can make it, let's just stay together
Come together, don't gooooo
Let's just have some fun and be together
Forever... for liiiiife

[Snoop Dogg]
Now that we're livin our life especially, I say that you're my pick
And every day we'll dress alike and always stay slick
To me, I see you as a gift
Incredible, it's edible, my ice cream, have a lick
I'll catch you when you fall like leaves
And be the one that you need, come be my #1 please
See I ain't never blown no cheese
or done no songs like these, I love the air that you breathe
You know why? (why-why, why-why)

[Chorus] w/ ad libs</pre>
