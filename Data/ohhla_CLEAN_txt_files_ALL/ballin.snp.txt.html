[Chorus 1]
Like a star slipping out of place
Sliding from the sky
Tumbling through space
When you touch my hand
I swear I feel like I'm ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Like a wheel
Whirling round and round
Rolling down a hill (rollin' down a hill)
Spinning on the ground (rollin' down a hill)
Your kissing makes me dizzy yeh
In the head (ooh yeh)
And I'm ballin'
I'm ballin'

[Verse 1]
Hmm, I love this game coz this game love me back
I'm pushing a lac, smoking sacs like a mad mac
Bringing me back, banging the 8-track track
The Dramatics and Battle Cat and Snoop like that
Big stars in big cars we pull up at the big clubs and sit at the big bars
Sippin' champaign with a bowl of cavier
Hell yeh you are, yeh you are
Say it say it, coz they all deny it
Player play it, coz you cant deny it
As fly as it get, as fly as I spit you know its the shit
It's so gangsta, gangsta bitch
Switch back to the old school, old fools know
This here thang we do so original
I got to have it, lavish
Is how we establish
On the real love one it feels good to have

[Chorus 2]
Like a rose, flippin down the street
Looking oh so sweet (lookin' oh so sweet)
Bumpin to the beat (bumpin to the beat)
These streets they keep me busy yeh
Makin' bread
And I'm ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Oh here I go!
Ballin making dough
Working for myself
Coz it thrills me so
I keep women on my line
Coz they know
That I'm ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Oh here I go!
Driving down the road
I can't help myself
Ballin' Thrills me so
Yeh you blew my mind
And I know , I'm ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')

[Verse 2]
Do that, who that, you that one they called on
Baller' get your ball on
It's all on now fall on to a new groove
Really aint nothing to prove
We, set the mood
Or shoot some pool
Or blaze a Cool
What? Whatup fool
Now you can cruise if you choose but I prefer to do the cha-cha
And once my small kitchen ?throw?
You know I gotcha
Watch out, no need to pull your glock out
It's a players affair, now
Look at my hair and the girls wit me
They got the same thang on
Pimp pimp parade, my nigga get your bang on
Coz my uncles about to get their sang on
And all round the world, my nigga, it's the same song
And when its time for your callin', fallin', wit no stallin'
keep it ballin'

[Chorus 3]
He starts to mill
Just rollin' tru his town
Stacking dollar bills (stacking dollar bills)
Raising dogg pound (he be raising the dog pound)
Becasuse he's loved
Loved in every city
Thats why he's ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')

[verse 3]
There it is coz it is there
Now have a seat and come hit the game from a player
They say time brings change and change brings time
It's so genuine and so divine
It's been so long in fact its overdue
Now tell me baby girl what can D-O-DOUBLE-G do for you
I fell for you, I'll always look over you
Theres really not much that a player would'nt do for you
So quit stallin' and fallin'
And come get a bar of some of this ballin'
Now quit stallin' and callin'
And come get yaself a bar of this ballin'

[Outro]
Yeh thats right, this is ahh, radio station 187.4 DG
Sock it to your ass
With something from The Dramatics
And Snoop Dog
Let them spot that ok
It's another one of those world premiers
Doin' it to ya doggystyle, in ya air hole
for the 2000 plus 1, yeh</pre>
