[ ] = sampled words

[What'll we get for ten dollars?]
[Every t'ing you want.]
[Everything?]
[Every t'ing]

BILL:  Monica?
MONICA:  Yes, Bill?
B:  Monica, what would you do for a job here at the White House?
M:  I'd do anything, Bill.
B:  Really?
M:  Mm-hm.
B:  Well, do you swallow?
M:  I sure do, Bill.
B:  You do?
M:  Mm-hm.
B:  Well, what would you do with this cigar?
M:  Well why don't you let me show you, Billy.

[Ooh!  Don't do that, baby!  Ahh!]
[Hold on this!  Oh, sock it to me!  Aaah!]
Chorus (repeated during breakdowns)
[Ahh!  Me so horny!]
[Me love you long time!]

Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
Sittin' in my office with my dick on hard
Fuckin' all the interns 'cause I'm the boss
Picked up the telephone to call one of my bitches
Said, "What's up, Monica baby?  Can you come and kiss it?"
She arrived at the White House, knocked on the door,
Threw her draws on the floor and said "Fuck me!" like a whore
"I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning!
Your dick is much bigger than Vernon Jordan's."

Chorus
BILL (during chorus):  Now Monica ... Monica, c'mon, let's go into the
Oval Office, girl.  I just wanna break you off a lil' somethin' ... Come

on now, let's go ... well, you know we can go half on it, baby ...

Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
Gore always asks him why he sexes so much
It's the perks of being Prez; you always get a nut
Since you're married to Tipper, you shouldn't be sad
Don't tell Hilary so she won't get mad
'Cause you know she'll be disgusted if he ever gets busted
And Newt will be mad 'cause he didn't get the ass
He's a Prez in heat, a freak without warning
He loves oral sex, 'cause Bill so horny!

Chorus
BILL (during chorus):  Oh, Monica, I want you to come over here
and break me off in the Oval Office, now ... di-did you bring your
Presidential knee-pads?  I'm ready to get my freak on, girl, I don't
know about you ... I'm not a player no more, girl ... naw, I just
crush a lot ...

Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
You can say I'm a pervert or a desperate motherfucker
I'll hook you up with Paula and let you do each other
I'll play with your mind just like it's a game
I'll call my homie Vernon so we can run a "train"
And fuck Linda Tripp, 'cause I hate that bitch
I even got her on tape sucking on my dick
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning
Hilary's my wife, but Monica baby, you're my woman

Chorus
BILL (during chorus):  Oh Monica ... oh, I can't believe it's so
good, girl ... I'm gonna have to take you to the next Democratic
Convention ... so you can hook up all the fellas ... this'll be good
for some vogues ... I can't believe this ... ohhh God ...

Breakdown:
(Mixx cuts and scratches "Hey, what's the matter, baby?")

Chorus
BILL (during chorus):  Oh Monica, that's ... oh, that feels so goood!
Ohh!  Oh yes, ohhh!  Oh!  Ohh!  Ohhhh!!!  Oh yeah ... ohhh ... oh
yes!  Oh ...

Verse 4:  Fresh Kid Ice
It's true you weren't employed until you met Bill
He made you an intern, and you ratted still
You tell your parents that he turned you out
In the Oval Office of the White House
You said it yourself, you like it like he do
You put your lips on his cigar, and kissed it too
He's a freak in heat; Janet Reno didn't warn 'em
He loves oral sex, 'cause Bill so horny!

Chorus

Outro (repeated till end of track):
[Fuckie suckie]
[Me fuckie suckie]

BILL (during chorus and outro):  Monica, I can't believe you did this
to me!  I gave you a job, woman!  Dammit, why did you do this to me?
Now what's America gonna think?  I mean, it could've just been me,
you, and my wife Hilary!  No one had to know!  You didn't have to go
tell everybody, now!  Ken Starr's on my case and ... bringin' up all
that Linda Tripp and Paula Jones and ... Jennifer Flowers stuff!  My
wife won't even talk to me!  Hilary!  Hilary!  Hilary -- Chelsea, tell
your mom I'm talking to her!  Hilary, talk to me, dammit!  Cone on,
say somethin'!  I'll blow somethin' up if you don't talk to me,
woman!  I can't believe this! ... My career's in shambles ... but I
still love America!
