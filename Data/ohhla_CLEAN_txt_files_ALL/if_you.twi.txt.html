[Khalil]
Baby I know what your thinking
Asuming that my loves the same as them guys you know
Well baby what if your wrong
And girl you know my feet been aching
Walking on this journey of love and this road just goes on
And Imma hold on, hold on

And girl I know we're young
But baby I know what you want
And with this love we cant go wrong
Just wake up your love is right here
And I'm done just living in fear you gotta know that I'm right
It's you
And my mind is made up my heart is right here
I'll never give to your love unless I'm gonna find
It's you

And girl I know we're young
But baby I know what you want
And with this love we can't go wrong
Just wake up your love is right here
And I'm done just living in fear you gotta know that I'm right
It's you
And my mind is made up my heart is right here
I'll never give to your love unless I'm gonna find
It's you

Around my living rooms where I been pacing
Nervous for your love, your smile is stuck in my head
Its so amazing
Forget all of these dollars that I'm making
I wish that I could trade it all in for your love instead
Your so amazing

And girl I know were young
But baby I know what you want
And with this love we cant go wrong
Just wake up your love is right here
And I'm done just living in fear you gotta know that I'm right
It's you
And my mind is made up my heart is right here
I'll never give to your love unless I'm gonna find
It's you

[LIL TWIST]
She said I never ever planned on letting go
Matter fact I think I'm ready boo as far as marriage go
I say I know I'm still young but I'm really thinking so shit
All I know was I never gotta this feeling once before
And yo you make me feel different girl when I'm around ya
First day meeting you I crowned ya
I'm calling too fast trying not to harass
But Imma make sure I'm better than your last
Put his ass in the past and yeah

[Khalil]
And girl I know were young
But baby I know what you want
And with this love we cant go wrong
Just wake up your love is right here
And I'm done just living in fear you gotta know that I'm right
It's you
And my mind is made up my heart is right here
I'll never give to your love unless I'm gonna find
It's you
And baby girl
If you only knew
If you only knew
If you only knew
If you only knew
How much I loved you
How much I loved you
And baby girl
If you only knew
If you only knew
If you only knew
If you only knew
How much I loved you
How much I loved you

Just wake up your love is right here
And I'm done just living in fear you gotta know that I'm right
It's you
And my mind is made up my heart is right here
I'll never give to your love unless I'm gonna find
