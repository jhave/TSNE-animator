[Mase]
You make me feel...
It's the real thing girl!
Talk about it, talk about it
What you want, huh?

[Cardan]
One two, one two
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
One two, one two
Hah hah hah
One two, one two
Yeah yeah yo, yo, yo

Yo, nowadays girls be out for the money and things
But to me it's all sweet when I'm runnin' my game
I give 'em nothing but game till it's stuck in their brain
So once it's stuck in they brain, yeah my funnin' began
I'm in the want-ad, lookin' for a special woman
That's gonna gimme what I need anytime I want it
I take a cruise to Aruba, I'll bring you wit me
Then let you float out on the beach
With the string o' yo' "G"
I need a pretty momma
Silly momma, diddy poppa
Like that go to Great Adventure in they mini-chopper
That get her own chips, push her own six
And make me do my sits when I finish my dips

[K. Price]
1 - 	I like it, I like it
	I really really like it
	You want it and you know it
	But you play hard to get boy

	I like it, I like it
	I really really like it
	You want it and you know it
	But you play hard to get boy

[Stase]
Yo, real chicks do real things
Like find a man wit' a deal that still wanna sling
Always speak my mind whenever I feel things
Probably got no wings but I'mma still swing
And my real chicks feel what I mean
Am I right? Am I tight?
Do this chick bring it to the light
Is my body so right I could even attract a dyke
Uh Baby Stase, uh Baby Stase
While you was lovin' John Doe 
I copped a condo
While you was layin' backs down, I was layin' tracks down
I see it for a fact now, it's intact now
It's no need to beef, it's my turn to eat
Bring the drama to a cease, cars I don't lease
I push a Green Z-3, watch a screen TV, what
I'ma forever rise 
Rings be tetra-size
Girls be petrified
It's a heavy meza-ride

Repeat 1

[Mase]
Yeah kid Harlem on the rise
All Out, All Out

Yo, you better do what I say yo
Get this through your head-o
Long time comin', but waitin for my date-o
My man Blake-o, leave the scene hardly awake-o
If he could take three shots, he could take four
I'm on the low though
But wit a lot of dough tho'
And I hate a smart chick givin' me a dodo
That gimme mo' pleasin', and mo' reason
Just to lay up in Cali in the Four Season
Wit' a chick half Black, half Indonesian
Appalachian, I know this sound unbelievin'
Switch the rim's on the Benz every four seasons
Open up a new account just to through G's in
Got Blink chick follow me for no reason
And my girl stick around if she know I'm cheatin', what

Harlem World, Harlem World the clique
Harlem World the clique, come on now

Repeat 1
