[Intro: Jay-Z]
Uh, its the boy Jay-Z, and the boy R. Kel
The best of both worlds, please believe it
Brookland, Chi-Town, to all the beautiful ladies in the world
Dedicated to TT my niece, everybody in the world, talk to 'em Kel
(R. Kelly: It's the best, of both worlds) That's right
Tone this is mean and vicious man, so mean and vicious
Rockland, Roc-A-Fella, the best of both worlds, come on

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Lord forgive me I'm ballin out of control
Got the spirit of a hustler pourin out of my soul
Mami I love you but ain't no stoppin my stroll
If you wanna be down with me, you gotta rooolll
Like a roll and if my side of the bed gets cold
You gotta know that I'm out chasin doooough
I'm ain't stuntin these hoes, stuntin my growth
If I fuck 'em I'm fleein them, I need somethin to hold
Then I'm home to you
I might roam like a cellular phone, but I never leave you alone I
Solemnly swear, I was married to the block before I met you
It's still a part of me there but I
Solemnly swear, I try but it's in my blood
Pumpin yay, since I was yay high
I'm in love with the life
So accept me for the bastard that I am
You're still in love with me right?

[Chorus 2X: R. Kelly]
Baby I can't figure it out
Yo' kiss is just like honey
But I can't stop huggin' the block
All night tryna get this money

[Interlude: R. Kelly]
Stuck between these two worlds
What I'm gon' do with both these girls
Two main squeezes in separate cities
Both found out - man, shit ain't pretty
Stuck between these two worlds
What I'm gon' do with both these girls
Hard to choose between her and these streets
Cause the game keeps calling me

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Baby girl had me off my grind, off my clock
I would often find I was off my block
Couldn't keep her off my mind, my balls were shot
They never thought that a pause or stop
Was in my pores to push rock raw
Take a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw
Got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low
Like a one against the grain, got the sun against my brain
A girl in my ear, I like her for her
I'm addicted to this shit, I like it like I like her
Sometimes I can't figure it out
I'm in love with the life but she's sticking it out
She know wanna hug kisses keep a nigga in the house
Locked down while his niggas is out (out)

[Chorus]
