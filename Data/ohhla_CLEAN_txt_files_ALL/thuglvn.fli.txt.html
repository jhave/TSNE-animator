[Intro: TwinnFlii]
I give her good love, tell her look back at it
I have it like a fiend, crack addict
Jumping up and down she my jackrabbit
Niggas over here yeah they mad at it

[Bridge: Teeflii]
Annie you like it from the front
And you like it from the back
Well Annie I can handle that
Girl just throw it back

[Chorus: TeeFlii]
And I'll give you this thug lovin'
Annie I'll give you this thug lovin'
I'll give you thug lovin'
I'll give you this thug lovin'

[Verse 1: TeeFlii]
You could get it right here
I'll give it to you right here
Bottles going around we faded
And my mind keep on racing
Annie, gimme that, gimme that
Take my clothes off
Then I'll take your clothes off
Put your legs in the air
And I'm a eat it, beat it, bang
Eat it, beat it, bang
I'm a eat it, beat it, bang just how you like it

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: TeeFlii]
You could get it right here
I'll give it to you right here
You gon' tell your friends how we did it
And how I made your body get with it
Throw it back, throw it back
All that ass how you handle that?
Annie do it for me one more time
One more time
And I'm a eat it, beat it, bang
Eat it, beat it, bang
I'm a eat it, beat it, bang
Just how you like it

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: TwinnFlii]
I give her good love, tell her look back at it
I have it like a fiend, crack addict
Jumping up and down she my jackrabbit
Niggas over here yeah they mad at it
I start from her lips down to her waist
She like to get nasty and how I penetrate
Cause there ain't nobody like me
Nah, there ain't nobody like me
Now she want a thug
Every time she call she just wanna fuck
Darkside donkey I'm a let her fill it
Annie over here EML she addicted

[Bridge]
