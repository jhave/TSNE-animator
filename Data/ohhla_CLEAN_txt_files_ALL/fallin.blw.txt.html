Song:   Fallin Back in Love Again
Typed by:  jhsanos@sol.com.br

Chorus:
Fallin',fallin',back in love
I'm back in love again
I say I'm back,back in love again
I say I'm back,right back in love again

Suddenly it's happening again
I'm walking along the seashore
Building castles in the sand
And suddenly all my dreams have come true
And if at all love is the question
Then girl the answer's you
I feel I'm fallin'.....

(chorus)

Back in love,I'm back in love again
I tried to fight as best I can
It seems to happen every now and then
I'm falling back in love,I'm back in love again
So many times love's broke my heart
But it seems to me it's time to start again

(chorus)

Shadows dancing all across my wall
I called your name but it was all in vain
Because it wasn't you at all
So, I had to find you
Some way my love some how
And now my dear since you are here
Tell me how do you like me now
That I'm fallin'.......

(chorus)

You and me,for eternity will always be in love
You and me,for eternity will always be in love
You know I want you girl,you know  I need yoo baby
Yes you,you,I need you,you know I want you girl
You know I need you baby you got me back in love
