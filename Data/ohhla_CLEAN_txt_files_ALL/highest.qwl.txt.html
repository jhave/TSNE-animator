(Verse 1)
Yo, shit ain't like it used to be, Not since puberty
Who knew our paths would happen to cross so what you do to me
But now I love you with every bit of my heart
How I used to get you wet when I hit it too hard
I can taste you on my lips, I even love your aroma
Please stay close to me, we'll float into a coma
I love your red hair, I'm just dead air without you
Showed me the light with slight pools hype around you
You used to love crushed ice cold down your back
I'd try to swallow you whole, you rolled down the sack
But now it's empty, you and I'm whipped, I'm lonely
A love letter to you, but yes I hope the phone rings

2x
Every penny I made I always brought straight to you
My thoughts never strayed, I stopped shaving it's proof

(Verse 2)
If I can't have you girl consider this the suicide note
I miss your mind games ever since you and I broke
At time you made it hard to breath hard to see the end
Please one more chance I'll never let you slip through my hands again
I always showed your seeds love
You were never charmed
How's it better this way, with an empty set of arms?
I know we said we had to let the air clear a few days
I thought I knew life, well then along you came
But now it's too late
You were always more then just a friend to me
You've occupied everything in my short term memory
Sure there's other fish in the sea
You snagged the line
Corny but cold in this empty sack of mine

2x
My friends ain't seen you, said I should let it be
But yo girl you'll probably be the death of me

You're my source of inspiration, did I pass my limit?
We used to light an incense, we'd snap in the kitchen
Following our instincts with whipped cream in the dark
The chemistry between us when shit seems to get hard
We used to cut class to chill, we'd get alone I'd choke
Spittin' shit I wrote for you, not just blowin' smoke
No other will effect me in the same place that you touched
Sometimes I wish my friends would've never introduced us
You give me goosebumbs, but the truth is I love it
Sometimes too much to take, we used to do it in public
On the train in front of other people she never seemed to care
Where we was going 'cause sweet love was in the air</pre>
