Life.... Looking out the window. Kush and Orange Juice Nigga
You Might want uh burn one to this

[Verse 1]
You couldn't walk a mile in these 11 in a halfs even if you had a chance
Visions of this cash followed with the thought of the bitch thats chilling at my pad
Its all part of the plan
To come through get high as I can, party, hit the studio jet lagged
Packing my over night carry on, we dont check bags
Old folks are proud to see I'm young and I Louied up to my eyes
True story word to the wise dont let these labels gas you up to be somethin
Get yo paper never trust em
Watch the niggas you run with
I done seen niggas who had all they dreams fucked over, over some dumb shit
&amp; make no assumptions hotel owners saying the odors to pungent blame it on the reefer consumption
The difference between you guys is you lie &amp; we live it
In the sky so pay us a visit
Bet yo bitch be trying to kick it

[Wiz Talking]
What you aint you trying to eat nigga
COME ON, fuck is you waiting for
Nigga time just sitting around man. COME ON
Everything was all good. Now shit real

[Verse 2]
Soon as I enter the room its red carpets and bitches with pretty smelling perfume
Smoking cigars shit was fool
Now you roll hella doobs and anticipate that how fly tune
Sucker shit we just cant excuse
Steady trying to duplicate but they aint us
Got bitches dissing they lame ass niggas pot head kids rolling they dank up
Paparazzi taking pictures we famous
Held my city down like a anchor
Now its champagne we drink
Non-smoking room we just ashen em in the sink
I love her attitude she love tracing my ink
I get up in the wind. Leave her with something to ease stress
The best not just regular visions
Let you get a glimpse of how I'm living, HD
Young Khalifa gettin to the money safe key

[Wiz Talking]
Matter fact hit this
You cold nigga I got a coat in the trunk
Come on man leave that bullshit alone man
It's over for that
Put this coat on</pre>
