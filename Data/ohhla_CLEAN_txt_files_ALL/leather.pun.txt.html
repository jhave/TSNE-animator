[Big Punisher]
What I gotta do let y'all niggaz know?
I am +THE NICEST+.. +EVER+.. heh..
Hardcore?  Commercial?
Whatchu wanna do, you wanna wile up, you wanna dance?
Don't matter to me, I got it all locked down baby

It's not a game it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall, when I bring the chain with the saw
Bring the pain to your door like death was knockin
Unless you got my ends, I'ma make you twins with the Headless Horseman
Hell extortion, sell your soul, live your dreams
Don't pay the cost then {*bam bam*} say hello to the guillotine
A killer fiends for blood, screams of thugs like
fiends for drugs, I don't need no love
Give me your fear, murder, respect, beer, honies and sex want here
I'll bend them checks for years, hungry and stressed
You fuckin with Chris - fuck Pun - dead the wrath for later
Get your calculator, go 'head Decapitator's back forever
Can't count how many heads I had to sever
Half the niggaz I keep, I put em back together
That's the terror, cut open your girl
and make a truss out her flesh, like Buffalo Bill
You fuckin with reel to reel, rap axe maniac
Sound bwoy killer, hack hack chain-react
Two for one - double the death, same price
What would Big say?  "Huh, you know that ain't right"

Chorus: {with samples from "Scarface"} repeat 2X

It's not a game pah.. {sample}
We're gettin paid hah.. {sample}
It's still T. Squad.. {sample}
"What you came for?  Surgery, with the chainsaw!"

[Big Punisher]
Word to 'Pac and Big, my glock so big it can rock a bridge
Drop the midsection like the top of your wig
Ain't no bullshittin, gettin the full treatment
Special two heated missles, 'til your crew's leavin witchu
I rip you in half - blast that ass through a glass window
Laugh a little (HA HA) and dash in the S-Class limo
That's how we do it in the South Boogie
Where tough rough rookies get snuffed out, for talkin loud to me
Why should I even consider your crew?  Shit on your crew
Get rid of your crew, what I'm fittin to do
I split you in two, leave you impaired when I blast the shotty
Grip you like dope and leave you there with half your body
We Rowdy like Roddy, probably robbin your stash
Catch a body like Charlie up North, stashin knives up my ass
Survivin the task, we the last ones left
Blast them tecs with clips, fast as fast'll spit
Add some tips for any, bastard bitch, pappin shit
Watch me rep til the death from the bassonet, beotch!

Chorus

	{*Scarface*}
	Watch what happens to your friend
	You don't want this to happen to you
	you give me the money, okay?</pre>
