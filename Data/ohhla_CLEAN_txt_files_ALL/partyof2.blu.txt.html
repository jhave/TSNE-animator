Lay the text down, foundation. Check it out
Come on. Where you at Allo?
This is for the Ladies. Come on

Listen, you
Ayeo what up though? I never fantasizes to the upmost
So you can feel the vibes when we touch close
You make me wanna rush yo beautiful mixed ass and crush yo
Appendix when I'm wishin' I'm in it I just get stuck, yo
Wishin' we could fuck slow over and over
Till you sick and tired of gettin' pleased and kissed on the shoulder
You the only chick that make me wanna go down constant
And I know it sounds dirty and your friends think it's nonsense
But listen it's the truth, wouldn't tell you if it wasn't
I know you get annoyed cause I be talkin' bout us fuckin'
But your body's so stunnin', the fuck am I supposed to think?
You got me sippin' Rican Rum and I ain't supposed to drink
You lookin' at me like I'm too young to handle you
When I got a tongue to eat you out like a cannibal
Never think I ain't hung love, my shit'll damage you
Young puts it down like an animal. So tell me what you...

(Refrain)
You make me want to just spend my time with you
Just chill, just vibe with you. Just build, just ride with you
And all my ladies say)
You make me want to just get down with you.  Just get down with you
Just chill, just ride with you. Just build me around with you

You're so loveable. Body like a Goddess, my God it's be beyond fuckable
Make me wanna eat you like a Lunchable
So tell me what you wanna do, cause me havin' fun with you to me is just
rubbin' and touchin', touchin' and fuckin' you
I love it when you're comin' through you got me fixin' shit up
I even tried to plush my room by puttin' little shit up
Like red lights and Barry White with Teddy in the mix
You ain't gotta get the frame, ma. I know you get the picture
With the eyes that hypnotize and thighs I like to work with
Type to say you're fat knowin' damn well you're perfect
I love it when you work it, lookin' at me twerkin'
Your waist tellin' me shit like you just can't wait
Now I can wait but it's hard to, especially when I'm hard boo
You don't make it easy, talkin' greasy when I call you
Got me feelin' awful, cause you know I'm all for you
Plus I love it when you call me Blu...it just flows

(Refrain)
You make me want to just spend my time with you
Just chill, just vibe with you. Just build, just ride with you
And all my ladies say)
You make me want to just get down with you.  Just get down with you
Just chill, just ride with you. Just build me around with you</pre>
