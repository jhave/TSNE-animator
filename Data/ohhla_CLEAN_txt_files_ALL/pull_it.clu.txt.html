[Cam'Ron]
Uh, let me tell you somethin
Act your age, and I ain't even, matta fact, listen to me
Let me tell you somethin

AAAYYYYOOOOW!

Don't make me come at y'all, y'all don't wanna brawl
Make me run at y'all gun at y'all, take it all run it all
Actually there's a front it all lemme talk to y'all
Done it all y'all ain't even begun to ball
Winter, spring, summer, fall
The cream still stackin if the fiends still crackin
You the same one cryin, for that Billy Jean jacket black fever
Pussy ass, don't smoke no pot neither 
Mommy take care of your high fever neighborhood watch leader 
Close the drapes up,  make the tape duct tape your face up
I fuck wit more powder, then makeup get em laced up
P doe, have a party for the brother
15 minutes, but I feel sorry for your mother
I kill like the greats did
Had a state bid for stashin little Nate 
(He was only eight) but I hate kids I know all parents think they experts
But yo my TEC bursts is death spurts wet hearts and Guess shirts, what!

[DMX]
