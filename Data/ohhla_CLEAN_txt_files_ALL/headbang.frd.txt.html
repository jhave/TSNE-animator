[Verse 1: Fred the Godson]
Fred, Vado, Toast Moscato
Clap when a nigga getting chips, bravo
I open up shop, fiends rush in, Drago
For the record, I came with the Mac, Serato (Shit)
Too bad the ladies praise him
Shawty called me do-rag, I'm kinda wavin'
What you want? Get into us at the Days Inn
Room Presidential, Bush, Reagan
She a model and she look Asian
Me and Vado like Reggie Bush on the Ravens
Shawty said I tried to game her
I came in the crib unexpected, Kramer
I get down, GS, No Chris Brown BS
Medallion size of a Nintendo DS
Shirt Italian, Chain on a three X
Every verse stylin', stop the beat, BX

[Hook]
[Fred the Godson]
I cut the china with the chopsticks
And then I count what the block get
Then I wake up with your top chick
Awww Shit

[Vado]
Cause you ain't ready for this headbanger
Cause you ain't ready for this headbanger
Cause you ain't ready for this headbanger
Cause you ain't ready for this headbanger

[Verse 2: Vado]
I done seen everything but Christ
Ask me, these niggas is everything but nice
Like you seen me in everything but Mikes
I doubt that, cause I don't do everything, just Nikes
Boomerang, I'm the next Marcus
Smooth as Eric Benet barefoot on the red carpet
No wonder, loaf good in the bread market
Pardon, but make sure them bottles is red sparkling
Don't stop, let the beat build
What's your mortgage, Cardinal, that's a cheap bill
No worry bout it, I got it, long as we speak still
Want nothing out of this nutting, that's how this week feel
Wish I could bring Hud back
(Chill) Fuck that
(Chill) Fuck that
(Chill) Fuck that
Getting money for six, fronting, we love that
Pulling out in the six, stunting, we does that

[Hook]
I cut the china with the chopsticks
And then I count what the block get
Then I wake up with your top chick
Awww Shit
Cause you ain't ready for this headbanger
Cause you ain't ready for this headbanger
Cause you ain't ready for this headbanger
Cause you ain't ready for this headbanger

[Verse 3: Vado]
V Twizzy, Godson, we busy
I Vianni the jewels was popping, E easy
Steam piffy, keeps me lean, dizzy
Bundles of peanut butter, like what, you need jiffy?
Catch a heart attack, who harder black
Got the whole X in here, and where Harlem at?
Like Mike's first deal, I been a problem cat
Money train full speed, no stopping that

[Fred the Godson]
Fast, rapping
I live the way I rap it
Ripping it off the plastic
Come I show you some traffic
I got some caskets
Things start to get drastic
My gun's from Germany
Dirk Nowitzki, the Mavericks
Cupid in the front like the owner
Stashed the pounds of sour cause the aroma
Thirty-four for that Melanie Fiona
Fred the God's the one, I thought I toldya

[Hook]
I cut the china with the chopsticks
And then I count what the block get
Then I wake up with your top chick
Awww Shit
Cause you ain't ready for this headbanger
Cause you ain't ready for this headbanger
Cause you ain't ready for this headbanger
Cause you ain't ready for this headbanger</pre>
