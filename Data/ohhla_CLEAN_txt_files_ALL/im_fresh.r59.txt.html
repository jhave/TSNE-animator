"Mr. Porter has asked me to warn you
 that this next joint may harm your speakers,
 especially if you're riding in a whip with a shitty system.
 Ha ha ha, I made a funny."

[Intro]
Uhh {"As we proceed, to give you what you need"}
5'9" motherfuckers
Get live motherfuckers

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Get ready {"Cause this ain't"} FUNNY!
{"My name's"} 5'9" and I'm about to get MONEY!
If you could name another nigga that can do it
quite the way I do it I will have to say I blew it
Biggie, Pun, 'Pac'll say "I knew it, homie is the truest"
So let your cronies know you're only phony as your crew is
When that beat start, droppin and that heat start, poppin
Now that "Street Hop" is knockin
OxyContin, crack, coke, weed
Her-o-in; we're, cho-sen
OxyContin, crack, coke, weed
Her-o-in; we're {dope dope.."}
Nigga stop jockin, if I ain't like God then God is just like me
Firin squad, I am so fly God can sight me
I am me, I am simply my own envy
I'm jealous of myself, by all means

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm {"Fresh!"}
Tell you da-da-da-ding, call me
Cause {"We are"} {"Fresh!"}
Dope boy {"Fresh!"}...
{"Today's agenda"} Hip-Hop {"Niggaz bleed"} dick shots
{"There's never been a nigga this good for this long"}
{"Today's agenda"} Fuck y'all hoes {"Get money"}
I'm so dope boy, rock-rock star {*scratched*: "Fresh! Fresh!"}

[Royce Da 5'9"] + (Mr. Porter)
Triumphant, honestly I am just here to get clear
Like Niacin dietin bullets take a nigga weight away from him
like Jared from Subway, tryin to get full and
I am the bull and you ridin, blow your puddin inside of your hooded
I'm out of my mind, +ketchup+ or y'all'll be Heinz
I am (I'm just playin wit y'all niggaz!)
Sinister pimpin with benefits {"I put the gun to ya"}
{"Put that knife in ya, take a little bit of life from ya"}
And use a sample to finish my sentences
Y'all niggaz extra, I call all my niggaz comin to get ya
I call all my bitches Carmen Electra
Extra {"BITCH!"} Read all about me
Newspaper, move fakers, food taker, I'm starvin
I bombard you so pardon like I'm fartin
The one comes with a bullet, that goes beyond chartin
You couldn't finish what I'm startin

[Chorus]

[Mr. Porter]
... I'm just playin wit y'all niggaz!</pre>
