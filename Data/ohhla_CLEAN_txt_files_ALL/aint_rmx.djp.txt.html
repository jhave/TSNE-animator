[Intro: DJ Premier]
REMIX!!!

[MC Eiht]:
Yeah! Yeah! Ye-Yeah!!!!

[Chorus: Sample courtesy of "I Still Kill" by 50 Cent &amp; Akon] (Blaq Poet)
When I come through the hood (You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (You know it's on)
When I come through the hood (You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (You know it's on)

[Verse One: MC Eiht] (Sample courtesy of "I Still Kill" by 50 Cent &amp; Akon)
(When I come through the hood) Still reppin the hood
On foot patrol with a .38-snub
Hoes lovin the G, one-time's on post
Hopin a nigga snitch, hope he, sellin the most
Geah, will still follow the code
Couple of niggaz stretch when the work got sold
Keepin it all hood, dress code never switch
Compton all day, these G's never stitched
Ghetto birds skip the area (through the hood) they still fly
Reportin the homicide when cars drive by
Ain't a damn thang changed, everybody got vexed
In the neighborhood spot, with a couple hoodrats
Geah, niggaz for life so it's all year round
Compton's still the same so you know how we get down
Geah! Yeah, Eiht get it crackin
Still a menace so it be no actin

[Chorus: Sample courtesy of "I Still Kill" by 50 Cent &amp; Akon] (Blaq Poet)
When I come through the hood (You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (What! You know it's on)
When I come through the hood (You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (What! You know it's on)
When I come through the hood (What! You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (What! You know it's on)
When I come through the hood (Nigga straight poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (What! You know it's on)

[Verse Two: Young Maylay] (Sample courtesy of "I Still Kill" by 50 Cent &amp; Akon)
(When I come through the hood) ...I'm in the six-cuatro
Hoppin 'cause it's hot, the drop and squat the block low (Oh)
I'm not yo' ordinary thang, manye
In L.A., {EXTRAORDINARY GANGBANG}
Territorial marks, right on the wall
Broad day to nightfall, they ain't fightin wit' y'all (Naw!)
We poppin and chippin, poverty stricken
Honestly a lotta robberies are rockin the chicken
Ain't nothin changed, we wear khakis and Chucks'
T-shirts, hat to the back, exactly wassup~!
See you probably like me if you ride with the heat
I survive and eat, identifyin with the streets
Don't think I'm a switch, get rich and then front
'Cause when I'm finish with this, this where I end up
East to westside -- yes, that's on my momma
Maylay, L.A., popper from the Dodgers

[Chorus: Sample courtesy of "I Still Kill" by 50 Cent &amp; Akon] (Blaq Poet)
When I come through the hood (You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (You know it's on)
When I come through the hood (What! You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (What! You know it's on)
When I come through the hood (You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (You know it's on)
When I come through the hood (You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (You know it's on)

[Verse Three: Blaq Poet] (Sample courtesy of "I Still Kill" by 50 Cent &amp; Akon)
(When I come through the hood) WHAT!!! You know it's love love!!!
Chillin with the thugs and my duns light the dutch up
Nigga what the fuck's up!!!! I'm all good!!!
You don't wanna see me runnin up through your hood!!!
Dressed in all black, from head to toe
Got your own goons sayin why you mess with Po'
I don't give a fuck, who they say is next to blow
They just ringtone rappers and they already know
What! Ain't nothin changed, I spit flames forever
I'm hardcore like whips, chains and leather
I got shit locked, New York to this block
Time's up, tick tock, move slow, get popped
On the real yo I ain't even feelin niggas
Over twenty years in the game lyrically killin niggas
Reppin my hood checkin the weapons it's good
Steppin all over niggas reps in they neck of the woods

[Chorus: Sample courtesy of "I Still Kill" by 50 Cent &amp; Akon] (Blaq Poet)
When I come through the hood (You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (You know it's on)
When I come through the hood (What! You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (What! You know it's on)
When I come through the hood (You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (You know it's on)
When I come through the hood (You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (You know it's on)</pre>
