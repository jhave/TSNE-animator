(Pete):
The world's at the tip of your touch
So clutch that mouse in from your home
Roaming alone, just you and your portable phone
Can surf the world of mass production, it's like seduction
Being enticed by flashy lights and a thousand and one functions
And that something? To drive a disk that won't miss
With precise right info
Sports, or news reports, or chat with an overseas nympho
Advanced technology means progressed ecology (it ain't crack)
Fools is hooked on IBM, AT&amp;T and it's cool
It all happened sitting at a desk, and I'll bet
The freaks won't come out at night, they too busy workin' the internet
For real, might as well pay Packard Bell
Too many crosswires, frequently your frequency's a living hell
In a nutshell, the ways of pushing buttons came far
Got computers warning me, don't get to close to that car'
Computers asking leave a message, cuz nobody's at home'
Computers sequencing beats, so we can grab the microphone
So plug in, information dumping past human assumption
But I mean, man made machine, that should tell you something
Pumping computerized versus manual health
People outta work, families hurt after cards is dealt
And like I said, you can keep in tune from your living room
Satellite scatter, big brother, ear hustles, chitter chatter

Chorus:
Shooby doo wop, shoo doo bop...I wanna love you
In a nutshell, the ways of pushing button came far
(Computerized....I wanna love you)
Got computers warning me, don't get to close to this car'
(Compterized...I wanna love you)
Computers asking leave a message, cuz nobody's at home'
(Computerized...I wanna love you)
Computers sequencing beats so I can rock the microphone 
(Computerized...I wanna love you)

(N8 The Gr8):
Caught up in this worldwide web; user friendly
E-mail me, I check em on the daily
My connections, verifications with other nations
In certain sections, evaluations by quotations
Yahoo! Ride em now boy, clear your cache
Doing two hundred and eighty three styles per hour
Down the information highway
Central location sideways
Navigating, escape for the internet mindwaves
Browsing, over a thousand heads I could be housin'
Corrupted styles, stackin' up micro files
Mental drug entail, expirimental thugs could sell
Think straight, passwords, over bills, Monopoly game and go to jail
No unread messages, yes I guess it is
Nobody beats the music biz, like them indie kids
Illegal operation, system crash
Drive hard like C's and my colon backslash
Spin your address cuz I hack fast jackass
Always hot box, windows up, skip the skat past
The motherboard fingerbanger
Angered Americans online, wrong time, right place
Resignated to the second chamber
????? save as filename
Style game retreat, no escape, Alt/Ctrl/Delete

CHORUS

(Crush):
IBM-ARC at the party to start to spark 
We hardly impart all emcees that were ripped apart
Try to focus on providing for the future
Enter your brain, then re-boot cha
Get rid of what pollutes ya, troubleshoot ya
Just to let you know what you should change 
What's going wrong, also what you need to rearrange
And download it in a dumpster, trash it
Don't ask, it's something that we do, and never present it with wackness
Attack this track like a virus through ya back
It's not strong enough to combat this
The fact is your sloppy and your lip's floppy
You see me doin' things, knowin' ain't a human being can stop me
Poetry programmer and thought technician 
Making people wanna listen without commercial intermission
Hip-hop is my plight, that's why I write
To minimize manipulation of megabytes
Then let you in my memory bank 
If you remember when rank first to disperse with a verse
We stemming from the dirt
Skipped earth and hit space (what?)
Moved the paddle right
You see, we came to keep it bouncin' like a satellite
And after that, look, get caught up on a hook
Better yet, you can catch a lot more in a net
So DJ's, B-Boys, and all microphonists
You need to respect more collectors of components</pre>
