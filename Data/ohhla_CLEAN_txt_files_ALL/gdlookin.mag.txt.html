D.I.G.:

You damn right I'mma get him, cut him and split him
&gt;From his neck down lettin' him know I ain't bullshittin'
He shouldn't fucked around wit' Mr. Magic
He should of known shit get drastic when you start static
I burn niggas like lastic so they won't come back
They try to get to you, but feel the heat from the gak
I bust his ass have him fall flat to the ground
Hit'em twice in the head and walk away wit' a smile
Oh wha cha want me to do, bring him to you, and you watch me kill him
So you can see the blood drippin' 
and know I did it and know D.I.G. stay committed
Cuz you my nigga anything for you
I pull the trigga and be the green filla
Fuck that nigga I'mma get'em
That nigga history, I'mma put him out of his misery
You make him feel it, that not to play with these real niggas
A TRU nigga.....Ya Dig Nigga

Magic:

Its a shame this all started as a misunderstanding
There is no turning around because my money is demanded
Now I gotta call the fuckin bandit ...D.I.G.
Leavin' muthafucka's where they standing, single handed
Choppin one by fuckin' one and hit me on the cell 
When the fuckin' job is fuckin' done
Man do this for me dawg and I'll return the fuckin' favor
Cuz his momma know my face, I mean she's practically my neighbor
But I'm all about my paper we went together on a caper
And I ain't got my ends, this muthafucka gots to pay
I mean 3 people died and I ain't got a fuckin' quarter
But if my plans go right they'll be fo dead by tomorrow
But my heart feels no sorrow, he deserves to fuckin' die
Shit I did all the shootin', this nigga spending mind
He saw the killa in my eyes now he gonna feel my fire
Say bye-bye to the bad guys, yo life has been expired

Chorus:

(2)Well dawg, look its all good I know you'll do the same for me thats

(2)Nah soldier keep yo money, I don't really need it, I enjoyed killin'
