[Krayzie Bone]
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy, cause I'm floatin in ecstasy
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy, cause I'm floatin in ecstasy
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy, cause I'm floatin in ecstasy
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy, cause I'm floatin in ecstasy
As you can see I took the pill (I took the pill), right to the house
Grabbed a shot of liquor and pop, pop, popped it in my mouth
And I'm thinkin to my self that this might be a waste of my time
cause what if I don't even get high
Thirty minutes done came by, I didn't even seem high
until I stood up and looked at the ceilin for some reason
Now I'm tweakin, then I tried to walk but I was slow..
I guess I'm floatin in ecstasy (just like the nigga told me)

[Krayzie Bone &amp; Flesh Bone]
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy

[Flesh Bone]
My name come alive, be told
And I'm pokin in somethin, oh damn but it ain't no joke  
Cut guards and red beans
And for them niggaz that follow me around for my mojo
Feelin so see... cause I'm floatin in ecstasy (alright)
Ahh, my nigga just call up the homey
To hook us up on that liquid G
and if these hoes don't wanna see, they gotta check the spot quickly
Im feelin way high, but I'm also feelin way low
But damn I'm stuck in between
Fuckin with broad boys and never get used
Just help, just throw in a few more 
Diablos, nigga Flesh Bone so chill
I'm feelin it hump through my body, feelin hot and exotic
Feelin knocked out, feelin too sexy for my motherFUCKin self!
Gotta find my bitch and fuck her ass to death!

[Krayzie Bone &amp; Flesh Bone]
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy

[Layzie Bone]
Whose my nigga that told me the level? 
I started to see the devil, nigga was floatin in ecstasy
Shit, I took the pill, couldn't feel nothin so I'm breakin
but about thirty more minutes later, nigga was on the couch fainted
Arms sweaty, man why in the fuck y'all let me do this?
Im lookin at my homegirl like I want her, nigga this some new shit
I realized, nigga took one step and started stumblin
and I was tryin to call my nigga but he couldn't hear me, so I guess I'm mumblin
Fall off into somethin, but I guess I'm on a mission
Tellin my niggaz that I love 'em now but it ain't nobody listenin
Whistlin, hangin out tha window, need me some indo
'till I let go, like, me silky fine-ine, ine
Flown the expo, knock.. knock, knock at the door
but nigga was paranoid, so I grabbed my gun bucked it at the door 
Ooh-wee, shit happens, my family got me faded
But I'm runnin a secret cous', cause a nigga can't take it
Shake it, if I can but I blend in with the killers
and I wish +E+ was here to feel pillish (pillish, pillish)

[Wish Bone]
I feel so violent, violent fuckin with that ecstasy (come roll with me)
I feel so violent, violent fuckin with that ecstasy ..
I feel so violent, violent fuckin with that ecstasy (come roll with me)
I feel so violent, violent fuckin with that ecstasy ..
I've been smokin weed for a very long time, why should I change?
And plus they say that ecstasy shit fucks up the brain (brain)
Ah, why should I, just to get high, weed gets me high (weed gets me high)
"Nigga try this here," they said "better then that there"
They say, "ya like it (ya like it)" so I tried it (I tried it)
I thought the shit'll have a nigga high and horny
Im high, but I'm too high, I wanna hurt somebody
Nigga you trippin, get a hold of that shit, and ride that high
But I'm trippin, body moves, won't nobody get hurt (hurt)

[Bizzy Bone]
Groanin, groanin, groanin and she ain't even in the car
Layzie won't believe we high off the LSD
Would ya' slow down, we ridin on the highway
Get the wheel so I can go down on ya, I sever it on my own way
(ahh) She reachin feelin so zigidy zigidy zigidy
Got these bitches, fuckin them bitches
Baby be peeled off, peelin on, movin slow
and Bizzy be rock hard, tongue well and mean slow
We in the club drunk, fucked up, and still rollin
They know my pockets swollen, hold up, show them we rollin
We rollin, rollin, rollin and rollin, rollin, rollin
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy and we rollin on that ecstasy
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy and we rollin on that ecstasy
.. and we rollin on that ecstasy, and we rollin on that ecstacy
and we rollin on that ecstacy, and we rollin on that ecstacy

[Outro] Fuck it, gimmie a pill nigga
	... Oh shit, oh shit!</pre>
