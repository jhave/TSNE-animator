"But it's a Herut-Likwit Crew Connection"(sample) 2x

[Defari]
Don't regret it, you had your chance and couldn't set it
You hear me rhyme and try to shine on my time, forget it
Hear me on radio, live vocally do edits
E-Swift scratchin and threading, with supreme unleaded
Only the best out the Likwit Crew out the west
And we shine time after time writting lyri-gets
On freshly buffed and waxed marble steps
Defari got a stlye that's iller than Tourrettes
Make you switch, make a bitch get undressed
Make people in the club wanna dance chest to chest
Bruised falcon, strive for perfection like Malcolm
Back the name wit potential, but now they know the outcome
So now the ticket's weakened, I stay away from tricks
Defari, Phil Da Agony, Xzibit, and Tha Liks

"The world's" "But it's a Herut-Likwit Crew Connection"

[Phil Da Agony]
Yo, talk a big game, play a big game
You know my motherfuckin name
Phil Da Agony, it's all the same same
Game tight, Crescent Heights, get the name right
I do seven songs in the same night
Work ethic, proper etiquette, the better shit
I want my gold plaque for this shit
Soon as the stores get it (you get it)
Focused Daily, Likwit activity
Phil Da Agony causing you total tragedy

[Xzibit]
My chest is burning from the Hennesy rock
Yo I live to see the enemy drop
The safety night got Kennedy shot
It's political, the way I smash down is pitiful
Situation critical, barely breathin in a hospital
Dead meat, we give it like professional athletes
The elite wit a chick for everyday of the week
I'm talking Monday through Sunday
Models walkin up and down the runway
I take a lethal role in the gunplay
To finish wit flyin colors, Tha Alkaholik brothers
Connected, respect it, ain't no choice but to love us
It's not, east to west, I want the whole world behind me
I got niggas in L.A. sayin "Fuck Guiliani"

[Tash]
I'm hella-cocky on the mic, I fuck it up on jeep beats
So while you rockin to this beat, the beat is rockin to me
Foul-mouth CaTashTrophe, I knock heads since '93
So when you come across my style, it's like you smacked into a tree
I turn the heat up in this bitch, I make the women strip fast
So no matter what you do you can't fuck wit Big Tash
I came to kick your ass, quick fast, not to house you
I want your homies saying "Tash smacked the shit out you"
Smoke something, drink something, eat lyrics that twist
This that shit that's on your baby momma's Christmas list
?So balls? amount to this, no matter what y'all niggas name is
You're not as famous, as the Likwit entertainers

"The world's famous" But it's a Herut-Likwit Crew Connection (2x)

[J-Ro]
It's the Likwit coalition, start the mission
We gonna turn this into a tradition
My b-boy stance is updated, I feel like we made it
Even though we underrated
Yo, it's to the Ro, act a fool over flow
I got the uncanny ability to cold rock a show
I got fired from my job cuz I was late to my shift
Cuz I was drinkin a fifth, wit John Jingle Heimer Smith
And here's another caper from the lyric landscaper
I write flows wit two by fo's wit sand paper
Now what is a MC if he can't flow
Up next is E-Swift and my name is J-Ro

[E-Swift]
We don't give a fuck if you down wit such and such
You can still get touched, by the Likwit bumrush
Better train hard before you face me
You better off fightin Royce Gracey
To get me out that ass you gotta mace me
I make MCs wanna tap out, before I blow they back out
Likwit niggas winnin every bout
Rippin MCs like cheap jeans
Fuck your DJ and your mainstream production team
And if you sleepin on us, then sweet dreams
Cuz when you ain't lookin we be bookin mad shows makin cream
My profession is killin studio sessions wit no question (what's that)
It's the Likwit Crew Connection
