(Hook, Juvenile)
If you wanna come see me for a bag
I'm out'chea
If you wanna see that mean green Jag
I'm out'chea
If you wanna see me rollin' that Phillie
I'm out'chea
If ya talkin' like ya comin' to get me
I'm out'chea

(Verse 1, Liffy Stokes)
If you wanna see real niggas who grind (I'm out'chea)
Everyday, I put my life on the line (I'm out'chea)
If a nigga need a lic on some 'Dro (I'm out'chea)
I got waitin', I don't break down my O's (I'm out'chea)
On the debt, old school hustlin'
I came up from nothin', and uhhh
The game's so cold, my pistol's protectin' me bruh'
The streets is my tool, to buildin' my legacy, uhh
I'm made officer, so what the fuck is you sweatin' me for?
I'm out'chea, fuckin' ho's and doin' shows
I'm out'chea, poppin' Mo's and smokin' 'Dro
I'm out'chea, doin' me, ballin' the fuck out
Chrys-T and Feezy jeans, throwin' some dust out

(Hook, Juvenile)
If you wanna come see me for a bag
I'm out'chea
If you wanna see that mean green Jag
I'm out'chea
If you wanna see me rollin' that Phillie
I'm out'chea
If ya talkin' like ya comin' to get me
I'm out'chea

If you tell me that it ain't really hot
I'm out'chea
If you wanna see me out on the block
I'm out'chea
If you wanna see that old school Chevy
I'm out'chea
(Twista)
If you talkin' like you comin' to get me
(Juvenile)
I'm out'chea

(Verse 2, Juvenile)
Boy hit my windows up, hit up my doors, then
Shoot up my partners and kid-nap all of my ho's, then
Make my money, funny, if I got it comin' to me
Talk stupid to a nigga, when ya run into me
If you don't want'cha grille, ya don't wanna live
You don't want'cha kids, you don't want'cha crib
That's exactly what you losin'
If you don't want it, better let the Lac kid move it

(Verse 3, Mayz &amp; (Liffy Stokes)
If you wanna see a real nigga shine (I'm out'chea)
Need a pimp to control your body and mind? (I'm out'chea)
When you ready to go cook up this cake (I'm out'chea)
Got a few hundred grams you wanna shake? (I'm out'chea)
Mobsta niggas spend our time on the grind
Sippin' 'Gnac, slangin' packs of the city's biggest dimes
Yeah you got a decent bag, but yo' shit ain't big as mine
If you get'cha game tight, I'ma have to rob ya blind
I'm from K-Town bitch, wit' different gangs on every block
And the way you wear ya hat, just might get yo ass shot
The Mobsta's got the game on lock, and the hater's full of fear
Scared to ride through the hood, cause they know we out'chea

(Hook, Juvenile)
If you wanna come see me for a bag
I'm out'chea
If you wanna see that mean green Jag
I'm out'chea
If you wanna see me rollin' that Phillie
I'm out'chea
If ya talkin' like ya comin' to get me
I'm out'chea

(Verse 4, Twista)
When you see me, pull that hood up
Betta' get low! We bout to tear the fuckin' hood up
Balla's and killa's and gangsta's (What'chu runnin' from?)
Balla's and killa's and gangsta's (Nigga, what'chu runnin' from?)
Shoulda' seen they face when I bought they work and got at the rock
I'm from K-Town, bitch and I don't know shit but the block
Gotta get that money, so I don't care
I'm posted up right here, and I ain't goin' no-where
You gon' have to move man, twenty-thousand a week, and I ain't hear nothin'
Bust at y'all and stackin' chips on the seat, if police come cuffin'
That's when I might have to hide out
Or dip through the hood wit' the chrome and the wood
When I pull that ride out, got a screen that slide out
When I jump out, boys gone (I'm out'chea)
If you wanna get them rocks and them blows (I'm out'chea)
If you plottin' on a mission to get me (I'm out'chea)
If you wanna see the Twist' in yo city (I'm out'chea)

(Hook, Juvenile)
If you wanna come see me for a bag
I'm out'chea
If you wanna see that mean green Jag
I'm out'chea
If you wanna see me rollin' that Phillie
I'm out'chea
If ya talkin' like ya comin' to get me
I'm out'chea

If you tell me that it ain't really hot
I'm out'chea
If you wanna see me out on the block
I'm out'chea
If you wanna see that old school Chevy
I'm out'chea
I'm out'chea

(Twista)
When you see me, pull that hood up
Betta' get low! We bout to tear the fuckin' hood up
Balla's and killa's and gangsta's (What'chu runnin' from?)
Balla's and killa's and gangsta's (What'chu runnin' from?)

When you see me, pull that hood up
Betta' get low! We bout to tear the fuckin' hood up
Balla's and killa's and gangsta's (What'chu runnin' from?)
Balla's and killa's and gangsta's (Nigga, what'chu runnin' from?)</pre>
