[Verse 1: Honey Cocaine]
Yellow bitch wear gold jewels
New bitch, drive old school
Them bitches hate like, "Who you?"
You ain't shit, you boo-boo
I gets mine and take yours
Shitting what I made for
Touring, bitch, I give it dawg
Tell her that I said, "I did it, dawg"
Yellow bitch, all night
Yellow bitch, all right
Yellow bitch, I does my thang
All the homies say why
I know, I know, I know your nigga love to sing my songs, bitch
If you fucking with me, then you fucking with the wrong bitch
I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
He 'bout it, 'bout it
He hit it, hit it
Can't live without it, 'out it
I'm in this dawg, treat that rap like it's my job
When my brahs fuck the cops, thirsty bitches acting pause
Don't be moving like you and I was friends or something
Cause I'm just doing me, rapping trying to spit something
I don't know you brah
Suck my clit, I don't owe you brahs
Dark skin bitch with the golden hair
Honey Cocaine to the fucking world, hey

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Fuck the world, came and gave her a baby
My car do 180, I'm losing sperm, I'm faded
Your girl ejaculate me, I'm horse riding that anal
This crazy shit I be saying insane, I'm Charles Manson
This motherfucker ain't landing
I'm landing on bitches' panties
That lambskin in the Lambo
Shoot up your leg, now you can't stand me (ha)
Pop up, pop up on you with cars you've seen in cartoons
I'm like f-f-f-fuck you, cause you, ain't got nothing to lose
Funny, Adam Sandler
I cover my back with mammals
They judge me, don't need a panel
You gossip too much; E channel
W-w-why you all up on me?
I thought I told you don't call me
My cousins, they see me shining
Now they're all begging for diamonds
I, I'm just good with this rhyming
Rolex, that's perfect timing
Might change my name to Muhammad
Like Ali, she call me Papi (ah)
Don't want more problems
I just want more money
Two house bunnies to keep the king company (ha)</pre>
