[Hook: (Toya)]
Hey hoe, I don't care what you going through
Cause if you coming with me, then you know what you gotta do
See girl I got the truck outside, and it's sitting on 22's
So just know if you trying to get to know me, you gotta get to know my crew
(once you get a taste, once you get a taste
You won't share your plate, you won't share your plate
Nigga don't underestimate this, nigga don't underestimate this
Like you are on some playa shit, like you are on some playa shit)

[D-Gotti]
Hey hoe, I'm trying to get the bank roll
Hey hoe, you love me cause I think thoed
Ain't yo, average gutter nigga
This ain't your birthday, but baby let me see you jiggle
In your b-day suit, I don't worry bout the crew
They always here, baby this is what we do
Boys misconstrew the troop, I was raised gutter
I'm trying to raise the cheddar, so me cuffing you down never
It's whatever honey, let me know if you coming
I can make you feel stunning, on them rappers with buttons
It's some'ing on your mind, come with me and relax
Let your hair down and chill, you iight with Max
Might get service, all in the truck
Clinch the wheel, body grip to the buck
And I had such to get ya, I'ma call you tomorrow
Fuck it I'ma trick, and let the bitch get spa

[D-Reck]
To the, Hotel
But hoe know, that you can't go tell
Cause after the show, we gon bail
Hit the road and get mo' mail, back to the grind
Before I try to break this finer mirror, fresh your mind
Saw your eyes from the stage, you couldn't make up your mind
But it's all good, cause we all got wood
And it's all good, and baby you got the goods
So let us run through it, like some track stars
Unlike we playing hot, ball in the backyard
Now we playing strip poker, got you dealing the cards
Ain't nobody gotta see it, just me and the boys
Girl go on live your fantasy, come up out them panties
Doing hand stands, showing out acting nasty
Doing it with precision, got my niggaz listening
Acting goofy get me, bout to get in where they fit in

[Hook]

[Dirty $]
Say Ms. Thang, you know my sti's
You want my cheese huh, hey hoe
I won't say you can't get it, just don't say I can't hit it
But what I get I gotta split it with my crew, you know
That's the rules of this game, a playa's rules never change
When you fucking for the fame it's how it go, hey hoe
See I ain't the one to judge, all I wanna do is cut
Run up in them guts, but my budget won't budge baby
Hey hoe, tell me what it's hitting fo'
This sucker duck over here, say he got plenty do'
For a pretty brown like you, but Dolla ain't the type to
Trick, when I can stick for free
You wanna stick with me, you gotta be down for whatever
So give my niggaz brain, and make em all feel clever

[A3]
Well I'm a pretty hoe layer, slab parked outside
Right after, get some customized gunners for my ride
Know I'm saying, believe me baby it's going down
They don't call me Pac, but yep I get around
Eyes planted on a thug, since he stepped in the building
Looking like your pussy fiending, for sexual healing
Come here baby, let a G massage your clit
Body rocking from the back, I know you love that shit
Boo say she never got it done to her, by a gangsta
Well that ain't me, but I'm still about to shank ya
Lay back, raise your legs over your head
Hold your feet, we about to make the sheets lose thread
Do the queen with a lot of pipe, riding the spleen
Make her tilt, like a old pinball machine
I knew when I met ya, you was bout my cream
So when we finish, let me introduce you to my team yeah
