We dominate but feel the pain from bullets my carnales take 
Out of state soldiers join us to form a conglomerate 
It's out of hate oppressed revolt from feeling that they gotta take 
All the weight so we go to war to find another way 
Intercept opposite forces entering our sick vicinity 
It's killing me how wars that make no sense last an infinity 
It's silly shit how a city gets mentally unfit 
But really it gets worse when buildings set the scene for murders script 
I know you heard of this crisis and what the price is 
High stress amplifies the need for all your vices 
But steer clear cause we're here in fear they're 
Taking over everything and so we fight the war years 
Fierce weapons speak for each side through open forum skies 
Some die when bullets pierce the skin exploding inside 
We provide a dream for our team look past the war scene 
Dethrone the king gain control reign supreme 
Aim high for your street regime 
Look for unseen enemies hiding in the smoke screen 
  
The town I live in got daily death so we're numb to feeling 
Blood spilling got my whole block concealing 
If cops come frisking we're felony risking 
Catch 22 system either way you fall victim 
The stage is set up the script is written so we get wet up 
Now think about who dies when we let the lead out 
We're killing family tragically 
The enemy dividing those fighting against it weakening our infantry 
We caught on to your big plan 
Separate us into street gangs 
Infiltrate the sets put some battles in effect 
To distract from your dirty outfit, yeah 
  
We rock the block that you got locked 
Caught in a battle with crooked-ass cops 
Heat we feel on crazy 
Gang infested LA streets 
We see the red concrete stains 
And street platoons feel pain 
Real soon times will change 
And you will see the truth that we claim 
Aim your sickness this way 
In sick games we reign insane 
There's only one way to explain 
And now you lay to die with broke frames 
  
Enemies of the state take center stage 
And watch the rules we violate 
Now we recall and fall 
For all sins of life and break the law 
There's many us dangerous 
Plenty of you want war we fight any 
We walk the paths all lost 
And bring LA P.D holocaust 
Anybody gets rocked the truth 
First your ass gets rocked and then shot 
We see through the plot 
City street teams get broke down and then got 
Rot in ditches dug 
To get filled up with government bitches 
We see the police 
And train to kill the brain of the all terrain beast 
Work done by street families 
Make us and the state enemies </pre>
