(Chorus)
The rule of Allah is God's equality
Desire for my brothers the same as I desire for me
But when my brothers stay physically and mentally trapped in a cage
My heart fills up with what? Rage!
The rule of Allah is God's equality
Desire for my brothers the same as I desire for me
But when my brothers stay dying of everything else but old age
My heart fills up with what? Rage!(x3)

Against the machine that come in between 
Me and my other mothers siblings
That's caught up in the green and things
That you can get beyond food, comfy clothes, and a home
And so the streets they roam without a civilized dome
To realize that the traps is set
Hounds is loose, pigs is juiced
To put another neck in a noose 
Without a second to lose
So powers abused and brothers are bruised
The devil's amused as squad cars cruise through
Ghetto's, where governments hold 
Everything that you own to a level where your poverty prone
So half of us will sell whatever it takes to make papes
While the other half are customers with hopes to escape
As they hallucinate sealing our fate
Despite the fact that your legacy's great
They'd rather sit home and wait
While the means to survive and thrive are shut down
So those that know wrong but can't afford right
Say what now

Chorus

Against my babies fake educators
The lieutenants to the legislators that hate us
Consistently fade since our traders betrayed us
With the sadist plot to decimate and degrade us
Before we old enough to be first graders
Putting pins in my babies heads
He could have grown to be physically thoroughbred
But mentally dead
They hide the lies in the books that were meant to be read
In the schools that either ignore em or can't afford em
Now the bigger they come the harder they fall
But the younger they fall the harder it gets to stand tall
Cause the blind mans deaf son
Will be the dumb father of a blind child 
Saying to hell with them all
With no family ties
So the next man's family cries
At the funeral cause somebody tries
The wrong brother with the wrong nine doing the long time
Where he learns that he committed the wrong crime in the first place
(Bust this)
He need to point the same gun
At the criminally insane justice
System that dissed him and kissed him goodbye
From the start
Cause his world view was based on a lie

The rule of Allah is God's equality
Desire for my brothers the same as I desire for me 
But when a fight breaks out
Everytime there's some hip hop on stage
My heart fills up with what? Rage!
The rule of Allah is God's equality
Desire for my brothers the same as I desire for me
But when you talk trash like you hard
But your heart pumps lemonade
My heart fills up with what? Rage!
When it's war time and you don't know where to throw the grenade
My heart fills up with what? Rage!
When my babies said role models fall victim on the front page
My heart fills up with what? Rage!
When my brothers stay physically and mentally trapped in a cage
My heart fills up with what? Rage!
When my brothers stay dying of everything else but old age
My heart fills up with what? Rage!
My heart fills up with what? Rage!
My heart fills up with what? Rage!</pre>
