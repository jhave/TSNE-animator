[Frank Ocean]
Yeah - bring it up for a kid
In the club, what the time is?
I wanna play with you baby
Can you hear me?
Oh, it's a sold out crowd
I'm kinda nervous, and
They yellin my name out
Can you hear 'em?
Ohhhhhh, oh I would cancel if I could
Ohhhhhh, and if you said I loved you then I would

[Chorus]
Make it a, private show, intimate affair
Sittin in the front row, only ones here
Said you want a, private show, said you want a, private show
If you want a, private show
Close the club then, close the club then
Close the club then
Private show, intimate affair
Dancin in the front row, only one here
Said you want a, private show, said you want a, private show
And you want it
Gotta have your backstage pass in order {*2X*}

[Frank Ocean]
I really love my fans
So we gotta move quickly
I want something this year
Don't shout out encore
You can sing along to my songs and then
Then a round of applause then
Girl hhh, oh I would cancel if I could
Ohhhhhh, and if you said I loved you then I would

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
Live, so much better than the radio, bet-better than the radio {*3X*}
Live, so much better than the {*2X*}
