[Verse 1]
The shit that you promote
Fightin, fuckin, like you don't want to grow
You talkin so much sex, but you nah tell the youts bout AIDS
and you tell them bout consequence, no!
You talkin like you a G
But you killer killin your own, your just a racist man's pussy
Tell me who you wants to know
What, when, who, where or how you do your hoe

[Pre-Chorus]
Certainly not, me
Certainly not, me
Cos baby personally, I like to be challenged mentally
I've heard it all before gangsters, pimps and whores
Quality is poorA girl likes me needs more! 

[Chorus]
It takes more to amuse a girl like me
So much more to confuse a girl like me
They got you, cos while you're braggin bout your badness
You're just avoidin, addin to the reel shit that's happening to us 

[Verse 2]
Who gives a damn about the ice on your hand, if it's not too complex
Tell me how many Africans died for the baguettes on your Rolex
So what you pushin a nice car
Don't you know there ain't no such thing as superstars
We leave this world alone
So who gives a fuck about the things you own

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now I could sit and shit about how I sex 
But my business is my business I got self respect 
I could talk bout how my press could pimp man doe
Get the keys to his ride and his home
But I looked it up and that would make me a hoe
Little sisters now I really gotta let you know
Reel women ain't sexin for no mans doe
Reel women work hard to make they own
And we can all chat bout gats and blacks on blacks
Enforce the hypes and all be stereotypes
But youts are watchin that ain't what I'm here for
Show em to think higher and aspire to be more 

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
