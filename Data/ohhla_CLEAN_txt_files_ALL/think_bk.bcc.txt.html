(Let's take a sec to think back)	--&gt; Buckshot
Beatminerz in effect
Ain't nothin ever lost between us
Evil Dee
Nahmean
(Let's take a sec to think back)
Boot Camp Clik
It's a framalama thing
(Let's take a sec to think back)
It went like this
(Think back) (think back) (think back)
As we go back...

[ VERSE 1: Buckshot ]
1981 - the first year rap begun
The first time I saw a backwards spun
I was in my living room practisin
Watchin the tube, _Facts of Life_
_Different Strokes_ in the afternoon
_Scarface_ looked mean in the flicks
Everybody who pumped coke back then was fiendin for bricks
'86, no fades, afro tops
In those days your whole ave was the spot
The scene locked with Lee patches, Cazel glasses
Suede Pumas and rumors of rap not lastin
Till the class of '89 came through
High top fade, tailor-made Gucci suits
Jordan was champ, Mike Tyson was amped
Reagan was the pres and the border was a place to camp
Just think back like this
As you reminisce, reminisce

[ (Jahdan &amp;) Tek ]
(Think back now)
When Erving said he had the monster
Baddest bitch in skin flicks was Heather Hunter
(Think back now)
Rosie Perez titties
_Def Comedy Jam_, the _Itty Bitty Titty Committee_
(Think back now)
When _Martin_ was on
Jazzy Jeff, Fresh Prince "Summertime" was the song
(Think back now)
Buffalo was the spot
Snitches got stitches and you got jumped 'stead of gettin shot

[ Steele ]
Zone with me
Come home with me
Come home with me

[ VERSE 2: Steele ]
Picture in your mind, a place and a time
Where we all can go, don't need dough to shine
All you gotta do is, be true to who you is
I'm original and God is my influence
Hip-hop, be bop, jazz, rock music
Palladium and Roof Top, Latin Quarters boomin
We keep it movin to the beats, tune in to the streets
The rumors and the passengers preach
Rap I master so I teach; each I touch
Respect the power of the microphone in my clutch
Say ma, your little boy's all grown up
Hey y'all, I told you all we got is us
I love pops, he raised me on some good old soul
Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield and Nina Simone
"Songs in the Key of Life" to hold
When the streets get cold
Always focused when I'm reachin for goals

[ Tek ]
That's PNC right behind me
Let no man take us under, bee
And no bitch for that matter, ya heard me?

(Let's take a sec to think back)

[ VERSE 3: Tek ]
This is for my 18 and under, 20 and over
Walkin round with the weight of they clothing on they shoulders
Look at me, 26 year old, years enfold
Drive a ( ? ) 'bout a year old
Did the gold, stepped my game up to grade
Rosary throwback, exclusives and haze
Seen hoes and dough come and go
Rememberin the reign of crack and power of dope
Witnessed miracles of babies bein born, niggas bein killed
Niggas gettin killed, babies born again
Showed your block love, Tekno Marine Breitling
The class of Lockman, new Jacob thing
Benz, 4, 5, 6
Truck, Navigator, Escalade, bitches want dick
Took it from the end of '89 through '99
I'm the nigga 2000 and beyond

[ VERSE 4: Sean Price ]
Meadowlark Lemon
Wood-sevens on the god neck
They the ghetto park reverends (peace god)
Lee patches got snatched, d's in the hatchback
With ease, nigga, pass that
Bennetton bag ( ? )
Niggas like, "Son, you fly" Yo, I can afford it
Decept niggas, in the party we tangle
With anybody, jump on the train, punch Guardian Angels
Don't believe, we put a stack on it
Cops like, "You can drink, put a bag on it"
Back in the days...

[ (Jahdan &amp;) Tek ]
(Think back now)
What's today's mathematics?
Saturday Night Specials, now it's automatics
(Think back now)
When crack appeared
VCR's got stole, shorty asses disappeared
(Think back now)
IZOD, La Tigra, 8 ball coats
My man Earl ( ? )
(Think back now)
Karate flicks, Gucci kicks
Favorite team the New York Knicks

[ Jahdan ]
Think back now
Dem ah see how rapidly things change into the passage of time yah
Think back now
He, style we don't borrow, we no lend
Go tell dem we ah set trend, yah
Yo ( ? ) dem just can't comprehend, yah
Yo, reset even though the times keep changin

[ Steele ]
Word is bond
Yo yo yo son
Remember goin Uptown, 125, youknowmsayin
in front of the Apollo and shit
standin there, went to take flicks and all that...
