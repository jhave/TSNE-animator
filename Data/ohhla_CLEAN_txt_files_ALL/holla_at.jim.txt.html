[Verse]
Southbeach ocean air them girls was hollerin' like, AHHHHHH
Oh yea that's me, fin' to hit them jet ski's I'm in Miami
Like I just wanna like I just won a grammy somebody told Tammy
Good head make me sleep good then she woke up yellin' AHHHHHH 
Got scared of them roaches man
Forgot my lil' cuz dropped them candy canes
This the shit I go through tryin' to entertain

Well I had this chick man I pulled out my dick she like AHHHHHH
Start screamin' and shit (ah)
She said damn that's a big ol' dick it's ridiculous
And yo stock is so pepperish
So she on the flo' the next thing ya know it's like AHHHHHH
Her husband bust through the door (oh)
So dipped, jumped in my 84's
Stopped short, oh no, I forgot my Kangol

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Holla at a playa when you see me in street
Holla at a playa when I'm walking on my feet
Holla at a playa when I ain't in my car (yea)
Holla at a playa when I ain't buyin' at the bar
Holla at a playa cause you knows it goes down
Holla at a playa man I'm from A - Town
Holla at a playa man y'all really slow man
Holla at a playa sharp crease get hoes

[Chorus]
Holla at a playa when you see me on the street trick, AHHHHHH
Yeaaa, holla at a playa! holla at a playa!
Holla at a playa when you see me on the street trick, AHHHHHH
Yeaaa, holla at a playa! holla at a playa!

[Verse]
Man I woke the next morning rolled over like AHHHHHH
Who the hell is this broad
Good lord I pause for the cause
See she fast asleep with her hands on my balls
I'm searching on the floor didn't see no rubber package
Now I'm screamin' like AHHHHHH, what the hell did I do?
Man girl don't tell nobody about this shit here
In fact, don't even speak when I see you

I say, hey, you, need to holla at these boys
These boys called Jim Crow (in the A - Town)
Fuckin' niggas know worldwide
With a car full of helpers inside
Then they came like a thief in the night (in the night)
Don't know why niggas actin' surprised (betta' holla now)
We gone in the blink of an eye
So ya betta' holla cause we don't say bye

[Chorus]
Holla at a playa when you see me on the street trick, AHHHHHH
Yeaaa, holla at a playa! holla at a playa!
Holla at a playa when you see me on the street trick, AHHHHHH
Yeaaa, holla at a playa! holla at a playa!

Holla at a playa when you see me on the street trick, AHHHHHH
Yeaaa, holla at playa, holla at a playa, holla at a playa, holla at a playa
Holla at a playa when you see me on the street trick, AHHHHHH
Yeaaa, holla at playa, holla at a playa, holla at a playa, holla at a playa</pre>
