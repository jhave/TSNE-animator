[Intro: Music from 'How Does It Feel' by Big Rich fades out]
Now how does it feel to make love to a G?
Do you wanna go back to your man or, baby stay here with me?
Now how does it feel to make love to a G?
Strictly on the West Side where I ride
Now, baby, come roll with me

Awww yeah, right there girl
Oh shit, awww, oh shit!

Yo Ice, yo this is Ace
