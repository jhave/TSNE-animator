[Intro: Background Singer] (Jadakiss)
Oooh babe, oooh babe, oooh babe (Gets even better) Baby
Oooh babe, oooh babe, can't stop me baby!
Oooh babe, oooh babe, oooh babe, baby
Oooh babe, oooh babe, can't stop me baby!

[Verse One: Jadakiss]
Ummm hmmm yes I does that
Stays hot I ain't gotta get my buzz back
What everybody tryin to be now I was that
They could never stop me, that's why I love rap
Been livin the life, crazy ice
With the baddest chicks in the world maybe twice
The swag, the gear, the bread
All the whips is a year ahead I only fear the feds
Forty five on the other side of the peep hole 
Head shot from point blank call it a free throw
Funny cause I had the +Vision+ since Coleco
Back then, still ain't reach my peak though
Louis loafers, Polo peak coat
Call me, whenever the bosses meet yo
Uh, I drove papi crazy
So the industry never 'gon stop me baby

[Background Singer &amp; Jadakiss singing the chorus] (Background Singer)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)

[Verse Two: Jadakiss]
Yo! I'm a call it confidence cause I ain't cocky
I just know one thing they can't stop me
Whether I'm on 5th or L.A. at the swap meet
It's all good cause I know the gangstas got me
First things first the jars are broccoli
I treat the rap game like a large monopoly
One on one, niggas can't guard me properly
And when they double team me the odds are sloppy
I move like them eighty milograms of oxy
Send your sister back to your family knock kneed
Got too hot for the grams who got weed?
In the rap bracket he remains the top seed
Revolver holds six, quick to blow three
Audio heroin so you don't O.D.
Shooters know you, but you don't know me
The block is crazy can't stop me baby, uh!

[Background Singer &amp; Jadakiss singing the chorus] (Background Singer)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)

[Verse Three: Jadakiss]
Yo, once I start, I ain't 'gon stop the squeezin 
And the gauze ain't 'gon be able to stop the bleedinN
And your girl ain't 'gon be able to stop the wheezin (nah)
When she get that phone call from the doc, we even 
You could not stop me, so stop believin 
Ringtone rap, this is not the season 
Punch lines hard enough to stop your breathin 
And the ladies'll still pay a lot to see him 
I'm a get rich long as I got my freedom 
Usually when you get hit it's for a reason 
If you in the hood, better dodge the Ds'and 
watch your Qs'and, be on your Ps' and 
Thank y'all all for comin out this evening 
Havin a good time with your liquor and treason 
Even if they knock me, then continue to watch me 
They still wouldn't be able to stop me
What?

[Background Singer &amp; Jadakiss singing the chorus] (Background Singer)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)

[Outro: Jadakiss]
Uh, uh, uh, Neo, Da Matrix!
They can't stop me
(You, can't, stop, me baby)
I'm too strong, too strong! Way too strong
(You can't stop me babyyyy...)
They can't stop me! Hahahaha!
Ha-HEEH!! (Nooo..., can't stop me baby)
Heheh...yep</pre>
