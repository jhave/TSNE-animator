I sit and wish...
I'm not a kid anymore...

[Hook]
Back in the day, motherfuckers said we would never
Be shit, but right now I bet they wanna see me doing bad
But I'm a G, and ain't quit until I'm reaching the top
And right now, we at the top and ain't no turning back

[Z-Ro]
Back in the days, it was hard to stack some ends
Nothing but young guerillas, kicking it sipping juice and gin
Trying to find a better way, to make dollas and cents
Packing my gat with a 50 pack and when the laws came, I would hit the fence
Catch me if you can but I'm more than a man, Z-Ro be a hustler
Trying to stack hundreds and fifty's, in a cluster
A buster I can never be that, Slow Loud And Bangin' in my deck
Nigga that's my go and get it music, because it helps me to get my check
Remember when motherfuckers, said Z-Ro you won't succeed
But I'm a millionaire, and I owe it all to the hatred I received
Can't forget about drank and weed, cause that's the key in my back
So fuck the world it's only Trae and Dougie D, me and my strap
Rest in peace to Robert Davis, Patrick Hawkins and Big Steve
I'm crazy chasing paper, till these haters come get me
Nigga we ain't the mafia, we be the Maab
And making motherfuckers hate us is our job, we ain't kids no mo'

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
I know the life I live be the reason for rhyme, even though it don't shine
Hard times running me out my mind, I pray to God that I will get my time
Did they hate me, cause I knew faithfully they'd remain to be shady
But I remain to do my thang, riding two deep with me and my lady
Jealousy and envy, made them cats wanna do me something bad
Like I was they enemy, and they wasn't feeling me but I'm still gon mash
To the top I won't stop, cause some of the people I know be a bitch
It won't be long for me to get rich, cause I'm a guerilla about to get pissed
Ever since 1999, I've been doing my thang repping this game
Trying to get change on top of change, stressing my brain trying to maintain
But I won't give up because I'm a soldier, whether or not they told you, these
Cats better get they act together, cause blocking the way'll get you ran over
Ain't no way I'ma let them stop me, cause we made the game and they copy
Perfected everyday struggling, now everybody wanna be like me
Aw naw, we ain't shining 24/7 I'ma keep on grinding
Drank to rap to bust a strap, and living the life while niggas trying

[Hook - 4x]</pre>
