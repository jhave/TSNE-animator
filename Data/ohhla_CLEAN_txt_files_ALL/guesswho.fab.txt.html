[Intro: Fabolous]
Yeah! I made some changes in my life don't regret none of them
So if you ain't heard from me then you probably one of them
Niggas want diffeent results but do the same shit
They wait for it to come, I became it
Guess who's bizzack nigga!

[Broadway]
Your back here all I know, back on that bullshit you always on
Everything was goin too good too long, I just want the old you right now

[Verse One: Fabolous]
The new you I can't do I knew you this ain't you
I'm not no angel but always remained true
You hear what they say my only complaint you...
Wasn't just listenin you let that shit taint you
You fell out like thanks do I lost all respect
For niggas that's bitches so don't call or text
Them bitches get checked, like they all correct
But they be wrong that's their called your ex
You know talk is cheap, so why call direct?
And you niggas broke, y'all call collect
I'm watchin my close friends act stranger for bread
You said you never change now don't change what you said
Face it y'all, all your bitches basic ball
But then you blockin like you eight feet tall
Homey, I'm in the truck with the Soul Tape on
Hoodie up, rest your soul Trayvon I'm that cool

[Chorus: Fabolous]
I said guess who's bizzack nigga!

[Broadway]
Your back here all I know, back on that bullshit you always on
Everything was goin too good too long, I just want the old you right now

[Bridge: Broadway]
I can try, to erase your pain
But you and I, both made some mistakes
I fucks with the old you the new you is (LAME!!!)
But what did you say, you said that you never change

[Verse Two: Broadway]
Uh! But you did soon as you got a chance
Why you poppin shit you should be poppin bands
Livin that good life, without a care
The new you is hot headed and I'm not a fan
But I still keep it cooler
I-I think you should cool out, for real 'cause that ain't you though (UH!)
Since you been on that high horse your life been on a new low
And I been chuckin deuces form that two door with my new hoe
Swear to God, I ain't losin no sleep
(I know you heard!) What I do to those freaks
I don't beat it up I kill the shit it's a funeral in those sheets
You mess with lames in seven days I swear them dudes so weak
It could all be so sweet (So sweet) But baby do your thing
And miss me with that bullshit that you be sayin
You complainin pointin your finger when you to blame
You know I got that comeback, boomerang, baby what's up?
Heh Heh!

[Chorus: Broadway]
Your back here all I know, back on that bullshit you always on
Everything was goin too good too long, I just want the old you right now

[Outro: Broadway]
I can try, to erase your pain
But you and I, both made some mistakes
I fucks with the old you the new you is (LAME!!!)
But what did you say, you said that you never change
And that's what you told me, but it's not what you showed me
It is what it is yeah, but I always love you</pre>
