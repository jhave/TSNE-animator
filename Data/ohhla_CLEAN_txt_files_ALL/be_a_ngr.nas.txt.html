[Nas]
Turn your radios up..
You are now allowed to listen to the radio..
The REAL niggaz are back, on the radio..

Uh, no slackin, no beggin, no askin, no fastin
No disrespect to Islam nor Imam or Pastor
No answers to questions the media's askin
Why we fight each other in public in front of these arrogant fascists?
They love it; puttin the old niggaz vs. the youngest
Most of our elders failed us, how could they judge us? Niggaz
There's verbal books published by niggaz, produced by niggaz
Genuine niggaz, so I salute my, niggaz
Not mad 'cause Eminem said nigga, 'cause he my nigga
wigga, cracker, friend - we all black within, okay?
We all African, okay
Some Africans don't like us no way!
A killng happened in Johannesburg, yesterday
Slain artist named Lucky Dube, hijacked
Some say N-double A-C-P, keep us sidetracked
But I don't buy that, I buy Aston Martins
Faster cars than, NASCAR cars and, sparkin while ridin
Critics, eat a dick! Journalists see I'm rich
with this N-word jargon I'm just starting, bitch!

[Chorus: imitating the "Dr. Pepper" commercial jingle]
   I'm a nigger, he's a nigger, she's a nigger, we some niggers
   Wouldn't you like to be a nigger, too?
To all my kike niggers, spic niggers, guinea niggers, chink niggers
That's right, y'all my niggaz, too
   I'm a nigger, he's a nigger, she's a nigger, we some niggers
   Wouldn't you like to be a nigger, too
They like to strangle niggers, blamin niggers, shootin niggers, hangin niggers
Still you wanna be a nigger, too? True..

Wake up in the mornin, shake my third leg in the toilet
Uzi on the nightstand, I'm the man you go to war with
Not a man you go to war against, patience, I'll get you 
if that means I can't sleep a WHOLE YEAR, I'ma get you
I'm official not "A-Tisket" or "A-Tasket"
I'll put you in the casket, with the biscuit or the ratchet
They smoke hibiscus, they plants or trees, advanc-ed weed
Don't forsake us, you all are fake blood like move make-up
I flow tighter as Tootie's braces, who be hatin us?
I be on a state bus in shackles if my .8 bust
'Cause y'all some tellers, opposite of bankers
I'm the shit for ages, my clique still real QB gangsters
Clique still movin like Freemasons
So if I'm on the flow for the law, there's lodges all across the nation
Nas is bred for the plan, to hold the Grand
Dragon's head in my hand, come and get me, here I am

[Chorus, omit "true"]</pre>
