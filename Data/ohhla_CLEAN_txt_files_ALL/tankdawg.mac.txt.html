[Chorus]
Tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas

[C murder]
I won't limit the truth, I roll with killers and dealers
From the 504 we be some tank dogg niggas
50 dollars for show, so nigga respect my mind
Fit shot to the arm from a muthafuckin' tech 9
Kill kill, on a murder scene
Got niggas tweekin for my muthafuckin' shit like a dope fiend
I get a buzz when I dip blunts, and uhh
I make moves with that nigga with the gold fronts
1998 nigga tha tank dawgs rule, I pull a lick and get go
Cus I ain't got nothing to prove, fuck with camoflauged
She die, you gun' die tonight
If that bullet don't kill you, then you gon' bleed from a dog bite
My shit sellin' like dope, uncut like coke
Nigga fuck a drug, my studio like a crack house
No limit for life, TRU niggas stay cut
We be some tank dawgs, and we ain't runnin'

[Chorus]
Tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas

[Fiend]
Damn I wanted to live, was it ?way beyond? Be'em or live
Moma get a shirts on her kid, I wasnt supposed to see 1-6
Now a thug ?? All the niggas tha tank can't be with
The young killers and much skrilla is all I see with
I can't see not be'n equipped and camouflaged in my six
50 dollars on my ?story bit?, I worry, worry style bitch
Even though my hostile spit on his mossburg grip
Quote it I spoke tank dawgs make hustlers quick
Got the never to pull shit, disrespect usual niggas
TRU gang affiliated with two more niggas
When we score niggas never just marijuana
Rome by the home copiana from mama drama
Chase blood like a piranha, sleepy eyes from that ganja
Left your neighborhood burning in flames, just for a reminder
Kinda hostile in a war, that was segregated
Tank dawgs, and boss hogs, guess were I was initiated

[Chorus]
Tank dawgs
Be a tank dawgs, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas

[Mac]
Now everybody wanna be a tank dawg nigga, cus them tank dawg niggas get
paid
Don't nobody wanna be a tank dawg hater, cus them tank dawg haters get
sprayed
They call me Mr. Camouflaged, cus IM a samurai worrier
Call a coroner, dead bodies in my Nautica van
I lay back with the thirty gat in my hand
Cus he's dead, he's a man, only tank dawgs understand
I came up from the dust, never givin' a fuck
14 hollerin' third world, grabbin' my nuts
No limit soldier till I die, ain't no stoppin' me, ain't no droppin' me
That's the way it was, the way it got to be
Tank dawgs back up in 'emm with the soldier shit
(boom, boom) on the nigga when he dissin' the clique
I'm like Malcolm X, but with my hands on the tech
To the bitches IM in love with 'emm, to the niggas IM ?on crack?

[Chorus]
Tank dawgs
We dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas
Be a tank dawg, we dem tank dawg niggas

[Master P]
