[Snoop Dogg]
Yo, this next record right here, is a dedication
This dedicated to those, who've come to an end
Quit like Gladys Knight... 
You know neither one of us wants
to be the first one to say goodbye
So, hopefully this record will help you
Get to the conclusion, ya dig?

I love this girl but I don't know about her
.As a matter of fact, I could go without her
But she got my daughter, I don't know why I bother
to try to make it work when she make it so harder
Wake up and break up and do the same thing tomorrow
I get tired of fightin', I feel no sorrow
for you, to keep it movin' in that Monte Carlo
That's what I get for fuckin' with a video model

[Raphael Saadiq]
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine

[Snoop Dogg]
You don't love me, you just love my Doggystyle
I used to put it on yo' ass, you ain't had it in a while
Instead of crackin' smiles, you'd rather cramp a nigga style
You act too wild, I won't walk you down the aisle
What you thought? Yeah, we could chill, we could talk
When I look you in your eyes I no longer see sparks
So it's, best we go our seperate ways and stay apart
No more me and you boo, I done had a change of heart

[Raphael Saadiq]
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine

I'm not sayin' I don't got love for you
But I'm not in love with you
(I'm just not in love with you baby)
I'm not sayin' I don't got love for you
But I'm not in love with you
And feels like such a... 

Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
Go your way and I'll go mine
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright
Go your way and I'll go mine

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Sorry it had to end this way
But uh, it is what it is
I'm alright, don't worry about me
I'm cool, ha ha, yeah
You go your way and I'll go mine
Real talk, I'm cool, I ain't even trippin'
I'ma roll out with Raphael
Yeah, fo sho, I'ma roll with him
I'm cool, you go your way, I go mine
I guess I'll see ya next lifetime
See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya</pre>
