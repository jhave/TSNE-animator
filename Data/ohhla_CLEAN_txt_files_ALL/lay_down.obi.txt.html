[Obie Trice]
Here we go

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
You could get popped; it's a possibility up in my vicinity
Poppin off with that hostile energy
In a hospital with a doctor getting in
When adrenaline is mixed with an obnoxious temperament
Honestly I got a monster pistol gripped
And I commence to spit, none of y'all exempt from it
Spit, spit, passes from it
You get stiff from it, church man see your box plummet
And I will never let 'em give it to me
I gotta live to be one hundred and three
Gotta reach my epitome, wanna seize my enemy
And receive my penalty nigga

[Chorus 2X]
LAY DOWN! (Lay down..)
I'm a man, man
I ain't runnin, I'ma stand wit my gun in my hand
I got plans and a place to BE!

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
I ain't tryna cocky wit it, but I'm a nigga from the block that did it
Got a nine that's livid, I ain't tryna see the box in prison
Getting knocked outta my position
Now I got a pot to piss in, pissed off motherfuckers' mouth off  bitchin
Probably cause he lack ambition, so his wack decisions
Get mad at the nigga that's getting 'em
That's when he see the next nigga that's hittin him
With a vigorous pistol over this ridiculous issue
Dismiss you, in attempt to
Take me out my motherfuckin tempo nigga

[Chorus 2X]
LAY DOWN! (Lay down..)
I'm a man, man
I ain't runnin, I'ma stand wit my gun in my hand
I got plans and a place to BE!

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Niggaz get nauseated, a artist made it
Had it hard against odds and emancipated
To the floor I spit cause, god damn they hate it
To see the lady they dated caterin to the latest
Shadiest artist, up in my radius
Get faded with a plated revolver
Rated me R, haters get faded with horror
Erased, no fate for tomorrow
All cause he think he hard tough
Got a car cause, he was runnin at the mouth, hush
I will never let 'em give it to me
I gotta live to be one hundred and three
Gotta reach my epitome, or decease my enemy
And receive my penalty, that'll be the end of he
Tryna seize my entities, finna be the end of his identity
When I tell him to

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
