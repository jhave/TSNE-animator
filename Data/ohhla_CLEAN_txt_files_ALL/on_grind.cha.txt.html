[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire - singing]
Sick of tired (sick of tired)
Of all the fakers walkin in my life (in my life)
I told ya once and then I told ya twice (told ya twice)
You got to go, I'll make a sacrifice, a sacrifice (hold up)
Dirty mind (dirty mind)
she playin games because she know she fine (she know she fine)
I said "let's play" and plus she didn't mind (didn't mind)
So I just let her sip a little white wine and now she mine (for real)
I can't live mine (I can't live mine)
If I'm livin yours, then I ain't livin my life (my life)
You will regret, I bet you'll pay the price (pay the price)
Somebody else is tryin to try me tonight (nah), that's suicide (let's go)

[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
On my grind (on my grind)
I got to stay grindin at all times
That's even if it means a nine to five (yeah)
That's even if it's workin overtime, stay on the grind (the grind)

I'm on my grind (on my grind)
I got to stay grindin at all times
That's even if it means a nine to five (yeah)
That's even if it's workin overtime, I stay on the grind (the grind)

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire - rapping]
Ye-yeah, yeah my rims brought me attention but my pension brought my tension
'Cause my last boss said that my check what he forgot to mention (what?)
That's okay, 'cause I quit (quit), Uncle Sam took half of it
Told that dude to get off my dick, bought a banana with my split
For my clip, loadin it up, told you the four and the four gettin tucked
How much more is he supposed to deduct? And the repo man always towin my truck
401K, don't come with play and MPCs don't come with Dre
Homie say he can get me a job but the problem is it don't come with pay
Mama say "can't say nothin nice, you ain't got nothin to say"
So I'd say, Mr. Bill Collector (*gun cocked*), be on your way</pre>
