Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Tell me with your back against the bottom
There's somethin' 'bout these days that got you caught up
Toss another empty bottle to the bay
What did you say, what did you do
When life came crashing down on you?

I should have seen it when you broke down
Stop and listen, and stop acting like you don't have a position
Cause I could see it from the jump when I kissed you
And feel it through the walls that you constantly put your fist through
You're pissed, but you ain't gotta fight like this
Life isn't worth a dime with a knife-sliced wrist
Spent a whole bunch of time trying to write your list
Of the last things alive that make you bite your lip
Little girl, little love, little hold my head to the ground in the mud
Little I'm not comin' back up 'til the whole sky falls down on top of me
And breaks my trust
Now run, and think about it all
Think about the last chance given and the first round fall
And if that can't get you back to where you start
Just call, and meet me in the place where we always are

Tell me with your back against the bottom
There's somethin' 'bout these days that got you caught up
Toss another empty bottle to the bay
What did you say, what did you do
When life came crashing down on you?

I should have seen it when I came back, yup
I shoulda...
Cause you don't see the things that I really wish that you would've
No you don't make the effort I really thought that you could've
To unlock the cage where you put us
And take another stab at it
Fly fishin' for the catch
With my heart tied onto the only line that you cast
And if I don't sink this raft right now
I'ma float down the river 'til my last breaths, gasp
Yeah, little lock, little key, little drop my boxes of thoughts into the sea
No, I'm not comin' back out 'til the whole world stops in its tracks
And admits its defeat, for good
Back to the shackles, back to the comfort of the things that attack you
And make you cold
I'm over tryin' to make this home, so just go
And leave me in the place that we'll always know

Tell me with your back against the bottom
There's somethin' 'bout these days that got you caught up
Toss another empty bottle to the bay
What did you say, what did you do
When life came crashing down on you?</pre>
