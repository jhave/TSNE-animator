Ya heard the Ice was rockin', ticket sales were high
Bought some fresh Adidas so you could look fly
Broke out from your crib rushin' to get here
Tripped ans stumbled almost broke your neck comin' down the stairs
Jumped into your ride, pushed the speed to the limit
Jumped out of your car faster than you jumped in it
Now you're at the jam but in for a shock
Stupid big line wrapped around the block
Through the walls of the hall you could hear me rhyme
Methodically you schemed a way to cut in line
But when you got inside the sight straightened your curls
Cause as you look around all you could see were girls

I love ladies

I think it's time that I tell the truth
I been dissin' females since my early youth
But you know that's a drag and there's no doubt
Cause females are the one thing that I can't do without
Female companionship is my one vice
I love to buy the girls things, love to treat em real nice
Homeboys you must admit the best part of each day
Is when a beautiful lady comes walkin' your way
Females possess that one commodity that no man will ever have
Not that hangs around me
They got it, we want it, they move it, and flaunt it
They shake it and sway it, we'll die just to lay it
We try to supress it until they undress it
And beg 'em to use it, and cry not to lose it
No man can deny it so don't even try it!!!

I love ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
I Love Ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
That sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!!)

I'm junkie for females and that's a fact
I'm not into havin' my homeboys rubbin' my back
Don't dig goin' to the movies alone
Or talkin' to myself on the telephone
Goin' to a disco that's packed with men
That's like tryin' to get a dance in the federal pen
Walkin' through a park with a gang of the guys
And a beach full of fellas never opened my eyes
And man if females are one thing that you don't need
You better get away from me at a high rate of speed
Cause if you don't like them you must like men
And homeboy that's where our serious problems begin
Because to me women are God's true gift
There's absolutely no question who I'd rather be with

I love ladies

I seen this fly girl walkin' down the street
Jammin' a box rockin' to the beat
The girl looked pretty, she really looked nice
So I said to myself she's got to be with the Ice
Walked over to her, started sayin' my rhyme
She said "Ice you're so bad, you damn near blew my mind"
I kept on rappin', runnin' my mouth
The next thing I knew I was at her house
Looked at her closely, said for goodness sake
The girl was cut like a diamond, had curves like a snake
Her top half was heaven, the bottom was the hell
I knew tonight that the Ice was gonna rock well
But then she started talkin' mess about love and romance
Until she noticed the bulge growin' in my pants
You should'a seen the girl's eyes as my body expanded
She grabbed for my leg, raw sex she demanded
My knees started knockin', I tried to run
She said "Please don't leave Ice, I want you to come"
This girl meant business I had no doubt
This is just about the time that the Ice passed out
The next day I woke the girl was through
Room still smokin', my legs black and blue
My eyes bloodshot, my hair pressed straight
My knees still knockin', I knew I lost weight
She was the best y'all, yes on this earth
I would'a paid a million dollars, that's what it was worth
If I had got her name or number it would'a been nice
But I'm here to let you know the girl went off on the Ice

I love ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
I Love Ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
That sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!!)

No when it comes to partyin' the ladies know how
When I ask for a reply they always scream owww!!
It's the homeboys always tryin' to act real chill
Sometimes it's jealous MC's mad cause they ain't on the bill
Maybe they scared if they say ho!
They might lose their cool
But I got some news for you: a fool's a fool
But don't get me wrong, most fellas do rock
They put their hands in the air, they take the show to the top
They start rockin' with the ladies once the show begins
They don't stand lookin' stupid like some mannequins
They don't lean against the wall like they're I some trance
They did not come with no intention to party or dance
You know what? yo dead beats should just stay home
Leave me, my homeboys, and the ladies alone

We love ladies</pre>
