[Intro]
112, 112
You know how we do
This is the remix
Guess who's back
Bad boy baby
Yo luda talk to 'em

[Ludacris]
Now baby you don't work if you work it
Tweak it twerk it
I feel like your every imperfection is perfect
Luda yea what you heard is true
I'll make you do things you ain't even know you can do
Got them weak in the knees cuz my back is strong
And you wonder why your girls wanna tag along
Cuz them birds are jealous
My words are embellish
Plus they heard I kiss every curve and crevice
I'm too hot to handle
I rock your mantle
When I play 112 and light 16 candles
Deep sea fishing in your favourite position
Every time you moan I pay close attention
Flip 'em like a pancake
Show me something
Or we can bring in your vibrating tongue ring
Lets mountain climb 'til we reach the peak
The technique will make you sweat
But don't sweat the technique

[112]
I wanna show you how I feel
Don't hold back
Heres my love
Baby you're the one for me
How can we get down tonight
No more game lets spend some time
Baby won't you give it to me
Jus give it to me baby

[Chorus]
You don't know what
You do to me
The way you touch baby
Girl I'm tired of playing games are you ready
I love it when you're on top of it
So spread it
Won't you just give it to me, girl we can do it
(x2)
Hot and wet
Girl you make me wanna sweat
When you touch me like that
Girl you know I wanna give it to you

[112]
Baby now it's getting late
Don't stop now
I can't wait
To show you belong to me
Know how I like it
Take your time
Close your eyes
Let me show you what real love should be

[Chorus]
You don't know what
You do to me
The way you touch baby
Girl I'm tired of playing games are you ready
I love it when you're on top of it
So spread it
Won't you just give it to me, girl we can do it
(x2)
Hot and wet
Girl you make me wanna sweat
When you touch me like that
Girl you know I wanna give it to you

[Chingy]
Face down, ass up
Thats the way I like to cut
I like 'em slim in the waist with no gut
The girl got me doing push ups tin hut
The big dog
She got me dealing with muts
Hop in the XLR wit Chingy on the cut
She got a TV in the steering wheel like Cris
Baby don't trip DTP loves this
I keep a flock of peacocks ass so G and rich
Till ya hate the straight plus I love 'em thicker than grits
She gave it to me cuz I got a lamp on my wrist
And about 50 ice cubes on my fist
him, him, him' right thurr gettin pissed
I take ya chick be like excuse me miss
Walk in with me girl you know you on the list
Lifestyle around me just cuz I'm the shit

(Chorus x2)
Hot and wet
Girl you make me wanna sweat
When you touch me like that
Girl you know I wanna give it to you

[Bridge]
Just keep it hot and wet
Girl I'm gonna make you sweat
Keep it real close to me
And let it drip all over me
You know just what I like
Touch it, love it, freak it all night
I'm doing it all to you
Baby you gotta keep it

(Chorus x2)
Hot and wet
Girl you make me wanna sweat
When you touch me like that
Girl you know I wanna give it to you</pre>
