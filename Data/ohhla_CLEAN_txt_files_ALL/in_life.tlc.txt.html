[Intro:](4x)
From Rags to Riches (riches)
Bet you Imma be the richest

[Verse 1: Lisa Lopes]
I started off as an army brat (Atten-hut!)
Seven months, class act
I was racin down the block
As a matter of fact
I could've been a track star (I guess I am)
I stacked bars
Comin' through your system in them phat cars (uh)
Cross country isn't that far
It's like I'm in the race, don't know who you cats are
See one day I fell from grace, landed in this place
My whole sh*t erased from talkin' back to my momma's face
Like I was lost in space
Without a trace, cuttin' class, bein' Mrs. Fast Ass
Gettin' blasted with dad, got caught up in the flash
My Nana goin' mad, had to make the dash
Saw a fell up in the streets
Did anything for cash
And anything to crash, in anybody's path
Gave everything I had
Took what I could grab (check it)
It was just a bunch of open rags

[Chorus: Bobby Valentino]
This is the story in the life of a hustler
Running for the come up
No one ever thought I would ever blow up
So I guess I had to show up
Now everywhere I go
The people wanna know
They wanna know where I came from
Not havin a pot to piss in
Stop and listen
Ill tell you how I came from Rags to Riches

[Verse 2: Lisa Lopes]
I remember sellin' coke
Can't believe that I was poisonin' my folk
Now I let my throat be the antidote
Always kept my hopes high
Now mama don't cry, 'cause I'll be close by
With the most high
I was playin' Robin Hood (in the hood)
Little Red Riding Hood
Til' the barrel pointed where I stood (yeah, I stood)
But walked away like I was absolutely positively sure I could
Attitude on fuck it
Some dollars in the bucket
Been scheming steady dreaming
For a chance to make some duckets
Caused a little ruckus on the sideline
Fully reconstructed every guideline
From the alley way to Cali, on the Grammy day
Went from disarray to mayday, mayday, mayday
Ran away from the sickness with a quickness
And went from rags to richness

[Chorus: Bobby Valentino]
This is the story in the life of a hustler
Running for the come up
No one ever thought I would ever blow up
So I guess I had to show up
Now everywhere I go
The people wanna know
They wanna know where I came from
Not havin a pot to piss in
Stop and listen
Ill tell you how I came from Rags to Riches

[Verse 3: Bobby Valentino]
Man, I struggled so long
Did whatever it took me for me to get on
I wouldnt let nobody stop me
Even if they told me I cant
I said Imma do it, watch me
And now Im just living life lavish
Money, cars, and clothes
Yea I got to have it
Its been a long hard road to make it
In this business
But I told yall Ill be the bestest

[Chorus: Bobby Valentino](x2)
This is the story in the life of a hustler
Running for the come up
No one ever thought I would ever blow up
So I guess I had to show up
Now everywhere I go
The people wanna know
They wanna know where I came from
Not havin a pot to piss in
Stop and listen
Ill tell you how I came from Rags to Riches</pre>
