[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, yeah, yo

[Inspectah Deck]
We pray for a better today, glocks and berettas spray
Everyday, how did I survive yesterday?
I can't call it, cops shot the alcoholic
The fiend saw it, he got the gun, he want a dime for it
The hood life, chicks and thugs, crips and bloods
Dippin' on the judge, pushin' whips and drugs
Burnin' big buds, gettin' love, spinnin' them dubs
For the taste of it, the low lifes'll split your mug
It's the home of the brave, the zone of the slave
We all want it, but gettin' it's, a whole 'nother page
The young guns wantin' respect, flossin' the tech
Bitches wanna strip, now it's all for the check
Yo, everyday, lives at stake, pies to bake
Same knife that cuts your throat divides the cake
For the hustlers, thugs, who scheme to survive
And all in between, scream "Fuck a 9 to 5"

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
In the bright lights, the big city
The thieves stay crawlin' at night, with eyes shifty
In the bright lights, the big city
The fiends come sortin' the price, with nine fifty
In the bright lights, the big city
They squeeze off, lustin' for shine and die quickly
In the bright lights, the big city
The streets take a whole of your mind, it gets gritty

[Inspectah Deck]
Daydreams, bought and sold
The high price we livin' might cost your soul
Secret indictments, furrows, with roll hoes
Codefendant, I hope he don't tell what he knows
Exposed to a life of crime since I was nine
Gettin' money by design, despite the time
Hustlin' to be a man and feed my fam
My wife, my seed, my land, completes the plan
Please understand, either legal or scam
I see the thieves in the van, I can't beat the man
Still monster ballin', eatin', speakin' ebonics
Wit foreign cars, custom made clothes and chronic
Bank rolls and prophets, shine solar powered
Fine hoes that's bout it, long as you keep they nose powdered
Obey street laws, careful what you say
You can play, but you might not make it through the day

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under, I'm used to gettin' over
I'm deep in the middle, indeed the heat sizzle
For the littlest beef, even the seeds keep pistols
Foreigners talk funny, friends they want from me
But all I need is long money and a strong honey
I need it "fast", I'm "furious" like Vin Diesel
I'm lookin' at my plate wit food for ten people
So, do what you gotta do, do what you want to
The blocks hot like a sauna, cops try to pawn you
The fiends trick you, dude behind you wanna get you
On the grind, your best friend'll talk for a figure
Walk wit a nigga, see it, don't talk about it, be it
Don't walk around, then beat it, we all bound to feel it
This ain't the town (for real), so watch your tour (that's right)
What's goin' down (what's up), its poppin' off

[Chorus]

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
Gritty...</pre>
