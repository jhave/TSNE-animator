[DR. JAY]
Yeah yeah! This is Dr.Jay reppin' the Soca Prince and when I'm live with
my bredrens, Monolith, Urban Bounce and Red Rat, Oh No! it's all about
girls "bye d'plenty" and you see right now, it's all about the Kama Sutra!
So ladies I only wanna see some sexy positions when you whinin' right!
Hey, whine yuh waist now, ay yi yi!

[SHAMON HARAGE]
Long ago, in the hearts of Scarborough
Sweet mama rushing me hard like El Diguardo
She look good, thinking sicker thoughts than Paul Bernardo
Background Barbados, from Esplanade though
Thick lips, fat ass and knee high boots from Aldo
Make a brother pack a thicker one, it's Desperado
The words I may borrow ain't from the heart though
The only thing I'm kissing tomorrow is a Marlboro
Present love life don't concern me or the Mono
Fuck 'em and leave 'em, and then I'm gone, that's the motto
Rishaard's like a soldier, hold you it's thunder
Recognize the big dog respect that I'm under

[CHARISMA]
"When you coming back, Charisma?"
Hush up your lip young sister, just whisper
Bawlin' out my name in jam like I miss ya
W'happen to you idiot gyal? Me never kiss ya
You're just a round the way jook
Me a go please her once and she hook
Time to release her, now she all shook
This little skeaser, me she gon' book?
Please! Recognize my steez, no time for drama
Too many big booty bashment beans in Toronto
Eyeing these Chinese, Guyanese
Never crave no vanilla just black cake and brownies
From around the way, always had to play
Never had to pay, practically
Got the crown to make every brown girl say
"Kush kush huta hai!"

[CHORUS - 2X]
Been watchin' you girls all night (all night)
You and all your friends look right (alright)
Hairstyle and outfit look tight
Alright, we doin' mad moves from the Kama Sutra

[SPIDAHMAN]
She has the Carib in she hand and she workin' she rass
and she playin she mass "Oh gosh darling"
Can't let you pass without taking a dance
"well then, come on nah man" "Jeez and ages!"
Me feel the Badung Badang when me get in the back, almost rub off me pants!
"Oh gosh", now what you name? "Shanti"
5'5, brown eyes, got a nice bamsey
Off the high wine do a low wine nasty
Grab me by the ganzi, head back to the gates
The way that ass a shake I had to mash up the paddicake!
(Uh  huh) I had to mash up the paddicake, ya heard!

[GRIMACE LOVE]
When I stepped in the place
She show me love and tell me,"don't bother moving with haste
Take time" But, my mind deh pon she wine
She waistline, how she twist up she behind
This young flesh got me wet up with sweat
Vex and upset, close to death, losing breath
So we jet from the fete to my spot
Done talk! Lip lock!
Preparing for shots, like she hearing gun talk
Oh scunt Tracey, baby, girl you amaze me
The Douglah bubblah come to trouble ya lady
"Maybe we'll chill out and shoot the breeze?"
You crazy? I give she what she need indeed!

[CHORUS]

[DAN-E-O]
Caribana weekend, Yonge Street flooded with joobies
Mono man reach late but still lookin' for goodies
So many batty and boobies we could rub come autumn
Want gyal like my song, dem hafi have big bottom
Look over so, "watch ya", you know di gyal butter
I wonder where she from, Guyana or Calcutta?
She have a wild bumper, you know say me wan crush her
She remind of a gyal I once knew, but me nah Usher
So listen here baby, me wan somethin' fi go down
So sweet gyal, you make me wan sing "Sugar Bum"
"Sugar Bum, Sugar Bum Bum" gyal when we meet
Me go treat you like this record and give you a nice beat!

[RED RAT]
It's the Rat! Oh No!
Yo, long time me a watch you through me binocular
Wonder if you like me seeing you're so popular
But me know me gotta get the number to your Nokia
Know me a bachelor still want you sloppy yah
Straight up, nah hold back, me wan give you di cocky yah
Booty like Jackie make you wine pon mi rockulah
Don't worry, me nah bite, nah me nah Dracula
Want get knock ya? Sit down pon me lap yah

On your mark, let's get go, Zing!
Take this, take that, ride me riddim
Hold on, me win! Hold on, me win!
