[Lil Mo - Rap]
Yo, what the deal son
Pulling up to my crib
If you aint call before you came, yo you aint gettin in
Its just as simple as that
So dont get left around
You better get on, you came with
And be gone before sundown because Im comin out swinging
Soon as I hear the bell ringing (ding), you got five seconds to count (4-3-2)
To get off my cement
And uh wait for my place before I call Jake
And have you locked up on your birthday 
And the keys thrown away

[Nicole - Verse One]
Boy I couldve sworn that I told you that
All those other phone numbers in my pager dont mean jack to me
So if you gonna start actin crazy
Save it
Dont even try to play me for your own uncalled insecurities

[Chorus]
When all I ever do is give you my time (my time, my time)
We be fightin over the stupidest little things (little thing, little things)
The way you actin lately, its not right (not right, no no its not right)
So if youre gonna be shady
Then i cant be your lady
No more

[Nicole - Verse Two]
Boy how many time I gotta tell you that
When Im on the road I cant answer my phone every single time it rings
Next time you leave a message, stop
Thinkin and screamin that Im cheatin
You know thats not my steez

[Repeat Chorus]

[Nicole - Verse Three]
Baby what I do
To make you feel this way
I never thought youd change
Espically towards me
Youve been saying things, thats
Makin me believe, youre so insecure
And the reason is cause me

[Repeat Chorus x3]
