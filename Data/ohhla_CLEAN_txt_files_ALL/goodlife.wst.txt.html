Now throw yo' hands up in the skyyyy

[T-Pain]
I'ma get on the TV momma, I'ma

(Ayy) ayyy (ayy) ayyy
(Ayy) ayyy (ayy) I'm good

[Kanye West]
Welcome to the good life, where niggaz'll sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living spree
Shit, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi
Ahhhhh~! (Now throw yo' hands up in the skyyyy)
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood - Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look - sorry!
Yo it's gots to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks - Lawry's
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
The good life

[Chorus: Kanye West] + (T-Pain)
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the skyyyy)
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the skyyyy) Ayyy
(I'ma get on this TV momma, I'ma)
(I'ma put shit dowwwwwn) 
Ayy (ayyy) ayy (ayyy)
Ayy (ayyy) ayy (I'm good)

[Kanye West] + (T-Pain)
Welcome to the good life! Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
Cause they got mo' {ASS THAN THE MODELS}
The good life, so keep it comin with the bottles
Cause she feel booze/boos like she bombed at Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C.
It feel like V.A. or the Bay or Yay
Ayyyyy~! This is the good life
(Welcome to the good life) Homey tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood
(Welcome to the good liiife) Like I'm new in the hood
The only thing I wish {I WISH A NIGGA WOULD}
(Welcome to the good LIIIIFE!) He probably think he could
But, but, I don't think he should
(Welcome to the good life) 50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
The good life

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen +Snakes on a Plane+"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin money's not everything not havin it is
I was splurgin on Tryst, but when I get my card back
activated, I'm back to Vegas
Cause (the good life) I always had a passion for flashin
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined
The good life

[T-Pain]
Better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmomma
Ain't the only girl callin me baby
If you feelin me now
Then put yo' hands up in the sky, and let me hear you say
Heyy, heyy, ooooh I'M GOOD!</pre>
