[Bizzy Bone]
I am not John, I am not Jesus
And I could never be Judas
I can't be a harlot, I could never be a dragon
My name, is Bryon
I am a slave of Allah
The master, of creation
The creator of alllllllll that Allah needs
The birds, the bees, the trees
And all that exists
And if the Big Bang Theory is actually true
Then you must explain to me, explain to me
Explain to me creation
And explain to me nothing</pre>
