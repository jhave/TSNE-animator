AZ:
Light the trees up, let this apervesence ease up
Don't freeze up, postition yourself wit your knees up
Believe what?  It's all street talk, can we please fuck?
Gotta catch a flight tonight, count some G's up
Headed for the Windy City, Chi-town
Do a nigga right, you might get slide down
Show you new sights, give you a feel of what the crew's like
Blew tight, casts who take money move right
Pursue heights, playin' my part from off top
Young playa hit a big score called props
Call shots, we can party 'til the ball drop
But Boo it's on you, slide through before the door lock
Don't be afraid just the things some do
Unbelievable, but still the illest things come true
Felt ya city chest, did yo' best to be a C.O.
Summertime, Zodiac sign, bless the Leo
Just show love, leave all the rest to me
And we can do this professionally (professionally)

CHORUS: [Kenny Greene]
Come get your love tonight
Everything will be alright
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Once you feel the joy I bring
You'll be alright

AZ:
Everyday another work day, that's what you say
But today it's your birthday, Lady let's play
Leave behind all these crabs, and snakes, they dead weight
Got a cabin upstate, somewhere to getcha head straight
Take a break from the routine, a new vibe
Different way to try to do things, you're too live
Saw your ex-man, see he got a new Lex land
Tryin' to ?flan? wit some cats I knew who ran scams
He know 'bout how we get down goin' out
Designer Anclinin', shinin', showin' out
You led me on, thought he was real, but bet I'm wrong
Fed since you left him for dead, his head is gone
It's the same song, so many seem to relate
And search for a new life, dreams to be straight
Just show faith, and leave all the stress to me
And we can do this, most definately (most definately)

CHORUS [Kenny Green]

AZ:
So for now and every off day, there's foreplay
I'ma freak from the door way, love a short stay
Takin' trips on the hot sands, I got plans
Champagne all the top brands, let's lock hands
Let me teach you all the right moves, wit ice cubes
It's a nice view, sex'll make you skip night school
And though I like you, also like the things you do
The way you chew, how you move when I bring you through
At the cafe, sippin' on some Crist &amp; Zae
Four course entre, wit the fish fillette
So what you feel when I'm close to ya, keep it real
Who the nigga mean the most to ya, what the deal?
Let's enjoy it while we still here, handle wit care
And we can do this like a Willie affair

CHORUS [Kenny Greene]

Kenny Greene:
Alright... alright... yeah, ah, e, ah... come get your love tonight... 
AZ will make you feel alright... k... come get your love tonight</pre>
