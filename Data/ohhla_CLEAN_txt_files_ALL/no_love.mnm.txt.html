[Lil Wayne]
Young Money, yeah, uhh
Throw dirt on me, and grow a wildflower
But it's fuck the world, get a child out her
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothin 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rollin sweets, I'm smokin sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars, are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands, are full of open bibles
Uhh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin not to sweat
And these niggaz know I'll lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin problems on a triple-beam
I'm stickin to the script, you niggaz skippin scenes
Uhh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin right I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put the dick in they mouth so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up up and away, man I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in a cage? Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in a safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my do' but I don't even check the peep-hole
So you could keep knockin, but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

[Chorus: Eminem] + (Lil Wayne)
It's a little too late, to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down, but what you say just don't {"Don't hurt me"}
(That's right) It don't {"Don't hurt me"} (I don't need you) no more
(Don't wanna see ya) {"No more"} (huh, bitch you get no) You get no {"Love"}
You showed me nothin but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around, around and you don't {"Don't hurt me"}
(That's right) You don't {"Don't hurt me"} (and I don't need you) no more
(Don't wanna see ya) {"No more"} (hah, bitch you get no) You get no

[Interlude]
No loooove (no!) no loooove (no!) no loooove (no!) no loooove
[LW] Hah, bitch you get no
[Em] You get no
No loooove (no!) no loooove (no!) no love
[LW] And I don't need you {"No more"} get 'em!

[Eminem]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life, I can
see these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than, most, shit's finna get thick again
They say the, competition is stiff but I get a hard dick from this shit now stick it in
I ain't never givin in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers how I treat 'em, so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em?
They call me a freak cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these wack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah that rap was tight but I'm
'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time so ya might wanna go back to the lab tonight and um
scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference 
when I rip the stage and tear it in half tonight, it's an
adrenaline rush you feel the bass thump from the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted the game, my soul started to rot fellow
When I'm not even at my harshest, you can still get roasted cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin from the top I'm not gonna stop, I'm standin on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore 
And you could never break my stride, you'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride, I'm killin the flow, slow venom any opponent
is gettin no, mercy mark my words, ain't lettin up, relentless I smell blood
I don't give a fuck! Keep givin 'em hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Outro]
No loooove (no!) no loooove (no!) no loooove (no!) no loooove
[LW] Hah, bitch you get no
[Em] You get no
No loooove (no!) no loooove (no!) no love
[LW] And I don't need ya {"No more"}
[LW] Hah, bitch you get no
[Em] You get no {"Love, love..."}</pre>
