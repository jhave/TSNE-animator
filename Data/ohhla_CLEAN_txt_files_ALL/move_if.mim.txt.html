[Chorus]
Move if you wanna if you wanna if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna if you wanna if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna if you wanna if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna move-move if you wanna move
MOVE IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA
MOVE-MOVE IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA
MOVE-MOVE IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA
MOVE-MOVE IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA MOVE

[Verse 1]
I don't undrestand how can I have so many ha-ters
Knowin I'm there father like my name is Darth Va-der
I can get you hemmed up while I'm bein tay-lored
Then I slide off to the side like a fa-der
HOMEY I'M THE PRESIDENT, GOVERNOR AND MA-YOR!!!
I CONTROL EVERYTHING, LIKE A DIC-TATOR!!!
GET YOU BIZ MARKED UP, TURN YOU INTO VA-PORS!!!
IF YOU GOT A PROBLEM GET YOU SWALLOWED LIKE A CHA-SER!!!
Model on my arm no homey I don't have to pay-her
All I have to do is tell her where I wanna take-her
Catch us out in Italy, then we in Jamai-ca
Caught up in the rapture, like Anita Ba-ker
WHEN I ROLL UP TO YOU NIGGAS LIKE A SKA-TER!!!
MOVE IF YOU WANNA WHEN YOU SEE THAT RED LA-SER!!!
NO MATTER HOW YOU MOVE AND THAT INFRARED WILL CHASE YA!!!
THEN I KEEP IT MOVIN, HOMEY SEE YOU LA-TER!!! MIMS!!!!

[Chorus]:
Move if you wanna if you wanna if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna if you wanna if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna if you wanna if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna move-move if you wanna move
MOVE IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA
MOVE-MOVE IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA
MOVE-MOVE IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA
MOVE-MOVE IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA MOVE

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin to keep it cool, if you wanna, you can move, if you wanna
Tryin to have a little fun, maybe move a couple numbers but
When you movin numbers, all the haters start to wonder
Then they talk behind your back, in the breath they speakin under
MAN I'M HOT, LIKE THE SUN, LIKE THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER!!!
STRIKE DOWN IN A FLASH, NIGGA YOU CAN CALL ME THUNDER!!!
CHICKS CALL ME PHIL DRUMMOND 'CAUSE I GIVE 'EM DIFF'RENT STROKES!!!
BAHH, BAHH, BAHH, BAHH, BAHH, BEAT IT UP, LIKE A DRUMMER!!!
They can call it one-hit wonder, but I guess that means I'm one-up
Light a match, play with fire, that just means you gon' get burned up
In the river, where you turn up, 'cause thye see I'm on the come-up
But it's our, turn, now, if you want it, take it from us
I DON'T NEED NO GOONS BY ME, IF YOU WANT IT COME AND TRY ME!!!
WE CAN DO THIS BROAD DAY, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LOBBY!!!
NIGGAS SAY THAT THEY THE SHIT, WHEN THEY BARELY JUST A POTTY!!!
WHEN THEY PROBLEMS TURN TO PROL'LY AND THEY PROL'LY TURNS TO SORRY!!!
TELL 'EM!!!

[Chorus]
Move if you wanna if you wanna if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna if you wanna if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna if you wanna if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna move-move if you wanna move
MOVE IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA
MOVE-MOVE IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA
MOVE-MOVE IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA
MOVE-MOVE IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA IF YOU WANNA MOVE</pre>
