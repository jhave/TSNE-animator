[Shaunta] (Brandy)
You don't know me like you used to do, uh-uh (No more)
You don't know me like you used to do, uh-uh (No more)
You don't know me like you used to do, uh-uh (No more)
You don't know me like you used to do, uh-uh (No more)
(You)

[Shaunta]
Come here and control your thangs
Top the royal girl, that them girls can't past
Still without the bull, like Mike I got game
You knew drop Cris, your mouth with no aim
Stick that ice in champagne
You don't know, I influenced your flow
And you don't know, move on and let him go
I turn your all night into a three minute tiger
He swallow my elixir like them gold Godivas
U-p o-n the k-n-o-w and be on t-o-p , with Brandy
Never skis, no matter how wet the beats be
Feel me, playas got a lot of nerve
After he done slipped with a lot of birds
That's why I'm digging your man, he's my style
Shaunta, Brandy, uh, Darkchild, what?

1 - [Brandy]
     You, don't know me
     You don't know me like you used to know baby
     You, don't know me
     You don't know me like you used to know baby

[Brandy] (Da Brat)
(Darkchild what?)
How could you lie to me?
After all that we've been through
Don't you know it's sad to see me in love with you?
I gave you all of me
'Stead that wasn't enough for you
Is this how love's supposed to be?
Now I'm trying to get over you

Repeat 1

[Da Brat]
Uh, you don't know me no more so watch the way that I flip
On the Darkchild remix so now it's more physics we kick
Hotter than the average team
I don't do shit for average cream, married to my dreams
In the event if you fuck up, I flee the scene
I'm taking everything I didn't have when I came
Nigga what? you can't stop this apocalypse mommy
When I 'stroy I'm thinking about how to get that money
And throw shade to those who hate
I most certainly make more money than most hoes today
My potion is potent enough to make a nigga wanna stay
I bring commotion anytime I approach their way
I don't need nobody who can't love me right
Squeeze, kissing, hugging, fuckin in the middle of the night
This a Brandy and So So Def collabo
With the Darkchild pushin' the nasty Black coupe
You know

Repeat 1

[Brandy]
Remember what you said
When you stepped up on the scene
You got into my head
Had me stressin' like a feind
Oh no I just can't forget
How you put that thing on me
I wish we never met
This way I wouldn't be lonely no, no

Repeat 1

[Shaunta] (Brandy)
You don't know me like you used to do, uh-uh (No me)
You don't know me like you used to do, uh-uh (No me)
You don't know me like you used to do, uh-uh (No more)
You don't know me like you used to do, uh-uh (No more)

[Brandy]
You, you, you don't know me
You don't me like you used to know baby
You, trying to get over you, you

[Shaunta] (Brandy)
You don't know me like you used to do, uh-uh (No more)
You don't know me like you used to do, uh-uh (No more)
You don't know me like you used to do, uh-uh (No more)
You don't know me like you used to do, uh-uh (No more)</pre>
