Song:   Gone to the Moon
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm gone to the moon [x3]
I float like balloons
I'm gone to the moon [x3]
I float like balloons

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I smoke a box of blunts for breakfast
Ay, and I woke up like Hugh Hefner ay
I had to switch her out my old phone
Ay, and I just got back from Tokyo ay
I put spikes on all my chucks now ay
I'm in pluto I ain't coming down ay
And I'm cooking Amy Winehouse ay
And it's stinking up the whole house ay
I been mix matching designs up ay
I get a hundred dollar line up ay
I bought the plasma for the weekend ay
You better see what my little beat in

[Chorus]
I'm gone to the moon [x3]
I float like balloons
I'm gone to the moon [x3]
I float like balloons

[Verse 2]
I drunk a gallon of lean (yeah,yeah)
Took a half of a bean (yeah,yeah)
Took shit to the extreme (yeah,yeah)
Young future supreme (yeah,yeah)

I'm gone to the moon [x3]
I float like balloons
I'm gone to the moon [x3]
I float like balloons
