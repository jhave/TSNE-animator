[Stat Quo]
Yeah, YEA!
Stat Quo (Stat Quo) Doc Dre (Doc Dre)
I represent the A-Town, A-Town
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I'm comin from the A-Town, A-Town
Ha ha, Shady Aftermath

Yeah, once again it's on
Young Statlanta live in this muh'fucker holmes
The hoes get naked soon as the song come on
The niggaz get wreckless, it's off the chain here gone
It's poppin speakers knockin crowded off on the flo'
They jockin it, watchin when I walks through the do'
It's him, tell a friend but you already know
Act stupid or lose it, don't bother to fuck with Quo
I'm kind of different, he's not the usual
Sippin Cognac in between two beautiful
bitches in the club, talk shit it's your funeral
I came to get a buzz and crunk, understand?
It's crowded, it's packed, it's jumpin - goddamn it's swole
I'm cooler than cool as my temperature's - 30 below
I'm checkin the scene if a new cut - droppin the low
Shakin they ass, backin it up  fast or slow (YEA!)

[Chorus: Stat Quo]
You know this thang don't stop 'til I say so
Now get low  get low, keep that ass on the flo'
You know this club don't close 'til I say so
Now get low  get low, keep that ass on the flo'
Yeah, now get low  get low, keep that ass on the flo'
Get low  get low, keep that ass on the flo'
Yeah, now get low  get low, keep that ass on the flo'
Now get low  get low, keep that ass on the flo'

[Stat Quo]
Yeah, it's goes three two one, shawty that's what's up
At the bar lookin sober but I'm high as fuck
And as far as all y'all who be actin tough
I'm in the spot with the glock, please believe it's tucked (woo)
We ready, we sweaty, it's hot - it's off the chain
We mackin, excuse me miss, tell me what's your name
The way you move in them jeans make me happy you came
I'm tryin to get to know you, possibly get some brain
I may pick your brains, I'm the man of your dreams
You like me you wanna be wifey and join my team
So I can sport you and support you by any means
Nah, I ain't givin you none of my thangs
But we can leave the club tonight, hit the telly and fuck
Long as you know when I bust - I'm in the dust
Ain't no chillin, it ain't nothin for us to discuss
Except what time your ride pickin you up (YEA!)

[Chorus]

[Stat Quo]
Yeah, yeah
Turn that ass around, go on and do somethin
Do somethin girl, touch the ground (YEA!)
Turn that ass around, go on and do somethin (c'mon)
Do somethin girl, touch the ground (OKAY!)
Now drop it drop it drop it  get low, yeah (yea)
Drop it drop it drop it  get low, yeah (YEA!)
Drop it drop it drop it  get low, yeah
Drop it drop it drop it  get low, yeah (YEA!)
