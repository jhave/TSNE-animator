You in our playhouse
Lets Play
Yeah, this your boy Pleasure, Baby Blue, Slicker, Spectacular
And we are Pretty Ricky

[Chorus]
We can playhouse and touch touch
Lay you on the couch and hunch hunch
Baby just hush hush
I'ma eat your body out like lunch lunch

We can playhouse and touch touch
Lay you on the couch and hunch hunch
Baby just hush hush
I'ma eat your body out like lunch lunch

[Baby Blue]
I'll be your Jamaican lover stroakin in your patwat
I'll be your Mexican lover bangin up your pinata
I'll be your French lover got weewee for your c double o chie
Baby let me li li lick your body
Wax that ass, wax on wax off like Mr. Miake
I'ma eat that plum, pop that cherry
Lick chocolate from your banana split
I'ma kiss your neck, keep it wet
Baby blue never had unprotected sex
This ice cream cone never gets off
It's gettin late turn the lights off
You the worker and I'm the boss
Get your pink slip girl
Let me turn you off

[Chorus]

[Spectacular]
Yeah Spectacular
Baby relax your mind
I hear you grittin your teeth
I see you grippin the sheets
Your legs is squeezin me
Girl you can't handle me
Five minutes you dead sleep
Havin wet dreams fantasizn bout me
And I knew that you loved it
Cause the way that you was shakin me
Never bout teasin me

And I can feel your body at it's climax
You finna bust
So baby close your mind and just hush

Girl I wanna play wid you (don't stop, don't stop)

Yeah, I be your lover man
Your sneaky, freaky, kinky brotha man
Your undercover lover man
You my wind and im your peter pan
We can get freaky deaky
Play hop scotch or connect the dots
