Chorus:
Killa Rhyme Klik keeps the function live
Heads treat my lovely on the 1-2-5
I might socialize if I dip and dive
'Cause it's the daily routine on which I thrive

I got platoons, I got regiments, I got battalions
I got ponies, I got mares, and I got stallions
I got planets, I got moons, and I got stars
I got jewelry, I got loot, plus I got cars
I got family, I got foes, I got an ally
It's the E man, you got priests and a rabbi
I got knowledge, I got wisdom, I got overstandin'
I got culture, freedom, you got a weakly meat
You have bless, you have blood, you have a sacrafice
You have guilt, you have shame, you got your soul on ice
It's a control device, can't you see my earth is in orbit
Lucy's holdin' product, that's why you can't afford it

Chorus:
