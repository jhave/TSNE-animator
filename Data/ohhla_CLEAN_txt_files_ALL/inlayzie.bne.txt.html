[Intro - repeat "my nigga" in the background]
Through the weather the storms, my nigga will always be my nigga
Through the weather the storms...
Through the weather the storms, my nigga will always be my nigga
Through the weather the storms...
Through the weather the storms...
My nigga will always be my nigga
Through the weather the storms...

[Bizzy Bone]
There was a thug I knew in Cleveland, strugglin hard to survive
He wanted the finer things in life, whatever the streets could provide
Hooked up with the killers slash dealers started to grind and reside
Slept on the streets and stayed on the block with a bottle of rocks and a nine
Gathered his homies, started a crew, stood on the corners in sloo
Way back in 1989 when they wore flats in they shoes
Before there was (?) in they dudes, no metal detectors in schools
Had him a gun in the bag with his books and took it to class and he'd shoot
Whoo, suddenly he was the man, everyone knew he was gettin that money
Brand new jewelry, bought him a car at 14, and everything lovely
Had him a stash, dreams of upper class, cash in his pocket to spend
Had it so good, had it so hood, man I wish I'da been there
And one day, the po'-po' was on him, he couldn't escape even though he was quick
They offered a deal, but just like a thug, he was what he was, he wasn't no snitch
He went to jail, did all of his time, back in the Cleveland, this time with a dream
He started a group called Bone Thugs and wanted all of us on his team
That's my nigga

[Outro] - same as Intro with variations</pre>
