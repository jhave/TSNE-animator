Song:   Puttin In Work
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ass so fat, pussy so wet
It's a workout baby, let me see you sweat
Got her busting back to back like a new chick
Putting in work like I'm trying to get a check [x2]

First off the boss, freaks all the hunnies
Stunting, playboy bunnies, those for money
Them the ones that I like cause that's who I get paid with
She got a million dollar pussy, keep a player rich
Break the trick, then make the trick make me rich
Them other niggas counterfeit, Thug is real as it get
I keep mines in line, all equal to a dime
I hit it from behind like I'm trying to crack her spine
I ain't lying, we gon bump and grind til I see her crying
I want to see you shine, so I want to see you mine
Rhyme part time but this pimping shit my passion
She's shaking it, baby get your cash then, thugger

Ass so fat, pussy so wet
It's a workout baby, let me see you sweat
Got her busting back to back like a new chick
Putting in work like I'm trying to get a check [x2]

I'm putting in work, til she say it hurt
I'ma get mine but baby you in line first
So fly, you on my mind while I make this verse
So fine every time I see her I'ma curse
Ass so fast, and you so wet, dripping sweat but I ain't through making you sweat yet
Took her to the tank and told her go and dive in
Beat it in the car like we at a drive-in
Keep her jazzy, tell them other niggas keep chasing
Then tell your lonely ass friends they need to quit hating
So amazing, yeah together we a dream team
I bust that pussy open, got her hooked like a fiend

Ass so fat, pussy so wet
It's a workout baby, let me see you sweat
Got her busting back to back like a new chick
Putting in work like I'm trying to get a check [x2]</pre>
