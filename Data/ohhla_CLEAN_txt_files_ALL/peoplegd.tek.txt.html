[Chorus: singers]
Time to change your way, people act cra-zay
Gotta face it now, people going down
Children running wild, running with the crowd
Gotta face it now, people going down

{*long instrumental break*}

[Chorus]

[Willie Band Cottrell]
Cra-zayyyyyyyyyyyy, and it's all been a part of me
Every day, every year, crazy things, is all I hear
Everyyyyyyyyyyyyday, same ol' thang
And it's time to get over, get over

[Chorus]

[singers]
People going down {*4X*}

[Chorus]

[singers]
People going down {*4X to fade*}</pre>
