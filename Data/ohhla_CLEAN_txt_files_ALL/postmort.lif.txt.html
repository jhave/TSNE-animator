Vision is blurred yo

[Mr. Lif]
This is the last chapter
Bombs hit who? Crushed what?
Over there? Oh my god, oh dear
I was hmm.. I think I was *h* movin somewhere
About to paint my fear bright glare not quite clear
Stay blinded to the light of possibilities
Think I heard the screams of those in my proximity
On how they started thinking wishfully
Guided by fear I'm suddenly aware
Please, is anybody out there?

[El-P]
It was a gentle fission kiss on my block
And hot light like a baby breathing sigh a terrain
And now my name is merely left
Suckin on brain exist before the final flash
The emotion of pretty details of a life I had passed
Now my warm night in Brooklyn is ash
Falling from the snot of loosies that I choked
Around the corner from class
Before the moments when the moon can move fast
Another summer slowly growing with the friendships
That would end with a blast
Or how the hours could so blissfully lag
She slid her tongue between my lips and I gasped
Told my dawgs and they laughed
Now we're combining our cash at last
A pack of smokes and a flask
Hopeless liquor with a (??gas path a maa??)

[Jean Grae]
Convert to atheism denounce god pronounce religion dead
Faith in nothing trace my wrists with razors
I refuse to wait for the blades to erase my spirit
Death - faced with it - run to it - not from it
Swallow all the pills in the medicine cabinet
Chase it with a bottle of 151 hung mommy
Head outside the smashed windows in trash my hotel lobby
Break the grip off the time at last
I find I get to him up Wish I did more sinnin
Get a strap on run up in two women
Laid in the middle of a highway wait for pain to hit me
Still a can with people lootin screamin come and get me
Finally it was porn shop biggest gun crowded street
Blow my brains to hell - I'm gone - and let the devil come for me

[Akrobatik]
What's the chance that I'd be one of the last ones left of my preceders
The Earth Crusher came before I could even conceive a fetus
But I did go from nothing to misunderstood elitist
Who tried to tell his people the lies instead of acting like defeatists
But what good is that? Cause we're now all goin to hell
Like some kid playin in his class out talkin before the bell
I died believing in righteousness but I could have indulged more
Cause giving in to temptation don't seem that raw no more
I heard some airline offered flights into space
I shoulda took it to see earth before they matched up the place
I thought I'd be alone when they finally came to get me
But nobody gotta miss me because they all comin with me

[Mr. Lif]
Our horizon was accessorizing we bred more need
Best believe this be the equation of greed
I need a new car and thus new breaks
Another tune-up with lube
Whatever's put together shall be unscrewed
In times of famine we made more food
Food made more people
It's all explained within the cycle of evil
Would I trade it all?
Cruisin down the highway on a bright summer day
Gazing out a plane to see the earth from miles away
Watchin the patriots win the super bowl
Grabbin that fumble from Ricky Prole
Or my stereo provided me with rhythm and soul
I don't know, all I know is I feel guilt for
Every single thing I've ever bought and sold
I shoulda been at more demonstrations
Planted bombs in corporations
Murdered CEO's and cancelled TV shows
Burned billboards and torn posters
I coulda read more
Finally I get to meet this god they left us dead for
And its ill, its power to the form of a bill
To which people killed by manipulated free will
Conscience be the crucifix a chopping block for poppycock
And I can feel our spirits drop upon these streets I oddly walk
Enough talk! Here's my last chance to cherish a thought
My flesh is fully melted and my stomach's in a knot
So to my love I hated to leave you alone
Parted my zone passion took me to places and my life was a poem
Baby I was on my way home about to catch a flight
Our meeting has dissolved in radiation and light
Love you gave me made me shine
You're gorgeous with a powerful mind
You lifted my spirits and strengthened my spine
I'm at peace with my life cause knowin you was divine
You made me see eternal beauty in a world that was dying
Now we're all ground by the grind
Out of luck and out of line, out of signs
And now we're out of time...</pre>
