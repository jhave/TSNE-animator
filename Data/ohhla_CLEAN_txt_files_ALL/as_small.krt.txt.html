[Intro: Big K.R.I.T.]
See, I was made in my father's image and they belittle my deeds
Their lustful convictions pledge allegiance to the almighty power and greed
See, seeds born withered, parents still children, adolescent in their ways
Some preachers false prophets, educated pigeon droppers using our sins to get paid
Slaves, give them freedom, but give them dope
Take away their leaders cause that gives them hope
Sell them dreams of changing things like they were never kings and queens befo'
As small as a giant

[Chorus]
As small as a giant, I'm still riding
Hand on my sword, Good Lord I need time
Watch for the sun-eaters blocking our shine
Enlighten my kind, reason for rhyme
I'ma find Zion, free my soul
Repent for all the things I done till my eyes close
When the boat man come I'm paying my toll
Outside the gates of Heaven, pray to God I'm chose
As small as a giant

[Big K.R.I.T.]
The beginning's kinda dark, not too soft, fairly hard
Drenched with love from my mother, connected to her struggle
till she cut me loose, now what shall I do?
It was all so easy, look at how they treat me ever since she pushed me through
Now put me back in, stop these contractions
Water breaking, aw damn, I know it's bout to happen
Failed events, no picket fence, a dream deterred
Bending liquor, chilling with my niggas, swishers and herb
Eviction notices, hopelessness thrown on my shoulders
God won't give you more than you can handle, carry these boulders
Give it all I got until I get older
Couple of medals on my sleeve cause life made me a soldier
Reminisce on how it was way back when
when some thangs were better off way back then
As small as a giant, a promise so divided
Probably ain't surprised in so long since we sung songs over large campfires
Cosbi was cool, but television is a lie
Some reason I relate to Survivor
Fresh Prince with no Uncle Phil
The Carltons that I knew never stayed where we lived, couldn't play with those kids
While they was reading books, we was playing cops and crooks
While they was writing essays, I was writing hooks momma
I'll be that nigga on TV
cause people like Bow Wow and Soulja Boy make it look easy
No pun intended, hoping they get offended
I'm throwing up if these niggas spitting
Didn't write it, but recite it like puppets on strings
Belittled as a peasant, but my bloodline is of kings
Knight in shining armor for this rap shit, I slash quick
towards a man's beard, leaving gashes on these industry bastards
They can't see what is real, don't know how I feel
They weren't raised where I live, in Mississippi

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Rise and shine, no time for sleep, thinking bout eating
Leaving this place, long gone
I get no service on this earth, I need to phone home
Did too much dirt to talk to God, nowadays I get the dial tone
Try again tomorrow, my heart filled with sorrow
My family broke too, so why bother trying to borrow?
No car, no house, drug dealing, feeling like it might be
my only option to get meals, what else could I do?
Put yourself in my shoes
If you had no whip, you'd take some shortcuts too
There ain't no time to be wasted, the world is going under
Nowadays can't tell fall from spring and winter from summer
I wonder if this was meant to be
Maybe all the bullshit was meant for me, it takes a lot of energy
Break these chains, erase these thangs society put up on our brain
How could I explain it? We ain't free yet
Obama cool, but he ain't sending me no free checks
They killing all my niggas, Lord forbid I'll be next
Not now, got too many sorrows to say and kisses to give
They don't feel how I feel, they weren't raised where I live, in Mississippi
