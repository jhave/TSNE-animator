[Verse 1]
See this ain't nothin that you used to
Out of the ordinary and unusual
You gotta have the mind state like I'm so great
And can't nobody do it like you do
Miraculous, phenomenal
And ain't nobody in here stoppin' you
Show no love, cause you's wassup
Look in the mirror, like what the fuck
Damn, I look good
And can't nobody freak it like I could
Yeah, okay, I got a little fat butt
My shorty tell me he like it like that
I'm happy, another me there never can be
See, I'm so outstanding
Don't care if they can't stand me
I'm sittin on top of the world

[Chorus 1]
See I look too good for this necklace
And I look too good to be wearin' this
You know I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited, I got a reason
See I look too good to be drivin' that
And I look too good to be buyin' that
You know I look way tood good to be tryin' that
I'm conceited, I got a reason

[Verse 2]
Now who's that peekin' in my window
Nobody cause I live in a penthouse
Baby I'm sorry, but I'm sexy
And all I want you to do is just bless me, let's see
This kid that I'm waitin' on
He said he love when my jeans look painted on
With this tight white tee, you ain't quite like me
Probably why I'm always gettin' hitted on
Now shorty tryin' to push up on me like a wonder bra
Listen when I speak, I wouldn't want you to take it wrong
Now, number one, I don't need you
And it's true, I only see you when I see you
Listen, two, you could never play me (why's that)
Cuz I'm such a fuckin' lady
Three, it's all about me
I don't wanna talk about it
If you love to hear it, here it go
I wrote a song about it

[Chorus 2]
See I look too good to be fuckin' you
And I look too good to be lovin' you
You know I look way too good to be stuck with you
I'm conceited, I got a reason
See I look too good to be gettin whipped
And I look too good to be havin' kids
You know I look way too good to be in a crib
I'm conceited, I got a reason

[Verse 3]
Oh, I know what I'm doin'
I can't stop my body from movin'
I'm boppin' and poppin' to the music
He keeps watchin' me and he's about to lose it
I'm droppin' it hotter then the ?????
Face down, ass up, on some new shit
I'm outta control wit it, dip it low, pick it up slow
Poke it out, now roll wit it
My thong showin', but it's cool, my shoes go wit' it
Now all I need is a room wit a pole in it
See I look good and I'm knowin' it
And I was never too proud to be showin' it

[Chorus 1]
