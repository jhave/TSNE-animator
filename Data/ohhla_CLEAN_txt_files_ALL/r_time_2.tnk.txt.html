[Chorus 2x: Tank]
In my race against time I - can't stop
Runnin through the red light - livin my life
Even if I'm gettin too high
I'ma keep runnin through the red light - livin my life 

[Tank]
Consequences, reprecusion
All discussion about my loved ones
Didn't know paper had a price on it
That your ice would have your life on it
The cost to ball ain't changed, but I'm trying to
Red lights flashing, but I keep on through
Mom said paper ain't everything
Baby girl wants a wedding ring, I wish that I could sing

[Tank]
Oooohhhh, I'm moving too fast
Oooohhhh, I'm not gonna last
Oooohhhh, smile down on me
Ain't got much time, made up my mind
I'm gonna keep on through, whatever comes is mine

[Chorus 2x]

[Tank]
Nobody cry for me
Cuz I, wanna see you smile for me
When I die, look through my window, to the soul
Tell me if you see Tank living to grow old
Cuz too many niggas done died for what I hold
The talent to warm a world which is so cold
Take me, save me, before I'm crazy
The only reason I live is for my baby

[Ja Rule]
Never did you tell me that 
Life ain't a game
Maybe if you told me this 
Shit might be changed
But now I'm just racing against time, trying to survive
And see why, ya'll niggas drive over nigga's vibe
If you gonna live, know you gonna die
If you gonna steal, know you gotta lie 
Get drunk and stay high
Don't de-nigga-ny, cuz they'll never take me alive
Feel me Lord, I'm running out of time

[Chorus 2x]

[Tank]
Oooohhhh, I'm moving too fast
Oooohhhh, I'm not gonna last
Oooohhhh, smile down on me
Ain't got much time, made up my mind
I'm gonna keep on through, whatever comes is mine

[Chorus til fade]</pre>
