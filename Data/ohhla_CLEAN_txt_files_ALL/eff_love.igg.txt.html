Song:   Fuck Love
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Fuck love, give me diamonds
Fuck love, give me diamonds
Fuck love, give me diamonds
Fuck love, give me diamonds
I'm already in love with myself
So in love with myself
I'm already in love with myself
Fuck love, give me diamonds

[Verse 1]
So you want a type of bitch that'll stay at home
But I'm too busy getting mine on
So the kinda girl you want
Boy you need to call Tyrone
I don't need your help
I can take care of myself
I might get into the money
Baby, couldn't you tell?
I'm much chillin in Euro
Making a whole lotta euros
Yeah my money so plural
Honey that's what I do though

You can't break my heart
You can't take my pride
Oh no, that love shit, I won't do it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Y'all dudes is a hot damn mess
I'm way too blessed to be stressed
So I don't want no boyfriend
Just give me them checks
What if I'm a material girl?
Can't blame me I live in a material world
It's crazy, this much it should be making me hurl
Big baby, I know you want a taste of the pearl
It's my life, I'm a do who I want to
Do what I want to, and I don't want you
Alright, see my times gonna cost you
And all my love don't cost a thing

You can't break my heart
You can't take my pride
Oh no, that love shit, I won't do it

[Chorus]

Fuck love, fuck love, fuck love
That love shit I won't do it
Fuck love, fuck love, fuck love
That love shit I won't do it</pre>
