Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Falling too fast
Clearly rules don't apply
Cant believe that I just met you
You got me here watching minutes pass by
Wondering when to expect you
There you go is this a dream
Looking like every picture that I've seen of you before
Ive seen it all before now that its over
Should have known better
Then to think this was real
And you could be mine
Should have known better
Slowed it down
Cause I feel you needed time
But I kept thinkin'
This could be something [3x]
This could be [2x]
This could be something [3x]
Maybe its just nothing at all
But this could be something
This could be something
This could be [2x]
This could be something [3x]
Maybe its just nothing at all
At all [2x]
Maybe its just nothing at all
At all [2x]
I guess its what we make it [2x]</pre>
