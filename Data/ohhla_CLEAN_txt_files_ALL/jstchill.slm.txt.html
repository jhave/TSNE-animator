Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Just chill hoe
Let me work my, let me work my
let me work, let me work this real slow
Tell me how it feel hoe. [x4]

Just chill hoe. Be still hoe
I'm working wood real slow, why my grill glow
She say she on the pill though
And I'm puffin kush by the pillows
wrapped up with cigarillos
So hell yeah, nigga still throwed
Rolled eighty-fours, fresh to the bones
When I'm on the road slap so cold
Drank poured, I'm a syrup-aholic
Watch the crib when those po is crawling
Was broke but now I'm balling
Used to cap but now they calling
She's ready to ride, ain't no stalling
Her and her friend, yeah they all in
She shotgun on my shotgun, I blast off and mash off
Took em to the pad on that note
gave em something they can brag about
Thug boss, toe tag em out
Kill em, make em feel it
She say she tired of y'all fake niggas
She wanna ride with the realest

Just chill hoe
Let me work my, let me work my
let me work, let me work this real slow
Tell me how it feel hoe. [x4]

Just chill hoe, let me work this real slow
I gotta crack my window cause they in dough
Got your mind on nympho
So let me beat your tempo with your mental
Pimp pimp string roll
I get you stuck like limpro
Cause I'm stuck to play, keep the list super fly like
You don't know what you in for
So stop and roll and pour fours, susta sucka shucka
Creepin bean, how you lane
press your chest against my nuts bitch
I need a big clone for my team
Don't twisted now to pushing buttons hoe
can't all this bass and your thoughts are scream
Don't shake, do it under these things
Run, get the fuck out my ride
See here ain't a one time thing
Be grateful that I let you slide
And not your friend, and not your pot nigga
She was a five foot claim she twerk
But she at the top now bitch and back
Why peel nigga had to chose you first

Just chill hoe
Let me work my, let me work my
let me work, let me work this real slow
Tell me how it feel hoe. [x4]</pre>
