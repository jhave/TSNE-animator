(Get involved on how the world revolves and evolves)
(...solve all that you can solve before your mind dissolves)

Get down right dirty on em hella quick
Put air in your tire, step in the shit
Bust raps, caps, throw rocks or pick up a stick
How you gonna handle it when it get thick?

I learned real early that life is hard
Sit down at the table, get dealt yo cards
Might get a good hand, could get a bad hand
The hood lands and bad lands done turned you to a mad man
Barely can sleep at night
Tryin to make the ends meet just to keep it tight
You want what he got but he ain't got much
It's a beautiful thang that you cannot touch
And you want what she got but she ain't got much
And to do or die, you never heard of such
Well, it's the luck of the draw, some come up short
I know you wanna keep your boat and you're bumpin afloat
I wanna double my notes, I don't wanna vote
I want everyone to read what I wrote
But most likely life ain't a bowl of cherries, though
Same old scenario
Sometimes it's just sour milk
In the hour of guilt your flowers wilt
And it's all in the power of what you built
You wanna lie in your casket with gold and silk
As for I, wrap me in Kinte cloth
Give me my respect due and then step off
Cause people nowadays'll straight twist you up
Have you broken up but can't nobody fix you up
I was sayin to myself I was gonna do somethin about that tomorrow
Yo yo, check it
But you was lyin to yourself and that can make you sick
So get down right dirty on em hella quick
Put air in your tires, step into shit
Bust raps, caps, throw rocks or pick up a stick
How you gonna handle it when it get thick?
How you gonna handle it when it get thick?
How you gonna handle it when it get thick?
Get down right dirty on em hella quick

(The world is full of bullshitters
Liars and triers and quitters
Coulda-been's, wanna-be's...)

I learned real early that life was hard
Never ever shit in your own backyard
Never fake the funk or front to play the part
Be smart, live life love, respect the art
Cause people take kindness for weak and prey
And they take for granted when you say what you say
They take advantage of the fact you give your heart away
You should be able to see through these games people play
Cause people just use you, it just won't stop
You won't say nothin and it makes you hot
They say they're your friends but they really are not
Because they only out to try and get what you got
The Jones' - what a classic case
It can turn a nigga into a bastard case
I know they all runnin to see who is the fastest in the race
You might as well get on your knees and ask for grace
Cause many will lose but some will come in last place
And many get bruised but some get blasted in the face
Somebody once told me that people were strange
I never knew what it meant till I seen some people change
I know you really want it but it's out of your range
And if you plan to get it then you gotta take some pain
You gotta master the fear
You just say: "Fear, come here," and drop a bug in his ear
And tell him to disappear, rid him, buy him a beer
No hard feelings but some people turnin the tricks
Some say it's just a natural pick
It's like Darwin's theory, but y'all don't hear me
Strong is how they skim me
Never with the gimme-gimme
Bottle water or a shot of Rémy?
My name is Ace One, baby, not Timmy
And you can get the jimmy

You get down right dirty on em hella quick
Put air in your tires, step into shit
Bust raps, caps, throw rocks or pick up a stick
How you gonna handle it when it get thick?
How you gonna handle it when it get thick?
How you gonna handle it when it get thick?
Get down right dirty on em hella quick
