(Silkk Talking)
Dear God, I know I'm wrong sometimes but
Who are they to judge me
Cause umm...he who don't sin should cast the first stone

[Chorus]
Dear God, Forgive me for my sins
Cause all I wanted to do in this world was to win
To all my soldiers in the grave or the pen
All my soldiers, thats blowing with the wind, life is hard
Dear God, Forgive me for my sins
Cause all I wanted to do in this world was to win
To all my soldiers in the grave or the pen
All my soldiers, thats blowing with the wind, life is hard

I ain't got time to worry about who hate me or love me
Why would I care how a nigga feel when only god can judge me
I know I deserve 5 mics for how hard I strive
But I'm cool cause I really only need one mic like Nas
and I ain't got time to worry about whether my foes is mad
Got bigger problems, should the color of my cars or clothes be black
If you really wanna understand me, then just come with me
Then you really understand why I keep the gun with me
Only way to make money, if you slung rocks
Rap was the hot shit, you had to have a jumpshot
Look, I try but my shots was off
I stay fly, stay driving something new on the block, y'all
It don't take a rocket scientist if you can add
I never had a job figuring out you do the math
Tell my nigga I had a fight with, I never told you I was starving
What's the rush, I figure I could just tell you tomorrow
But tomorrow never came, well it came but you wasn't around
I know God took you but I know you still looking down
You know I do this for the ones that ain't got no choice
I speak the truth for the ones who ain't got a voice, let's go

[Chorus]</pre>
