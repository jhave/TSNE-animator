[Akil]
Yo, yo, if you had much class
And style like I had
You would be so glad
I see why you so mad
I'm born with it
Like Marvin and Lauren with it

[Chali 2na]
Yo, deform with it
The way we perform wit it
You gon' get it
Your rebuttals are long winded
The song ended
If you satisfy

[Marc 7]
It's all splendid
Yeah, like Kevin Lockerbie
Rockin' some beige Wallabees
Blinded by the mockery

[Soup]
Time is never stoppin' me
Drop the clue
Connected with Cut and Nu
On the...1-2

(talking)

[All]
There's only one capable
Breaks the unbreakable
Melodies unmakeable patterns
Unescapeable whatever we aim at
We line 'em up
The party is weak from the same rap
Time's up
We payin' homage as well as returnin' favors
Candy for your ears hear us now
Or hear us later

[Chali 2na]
We fully capable
Make no mistake if we
BREAK a few rules
Make a few moves
And drop a few jewels
On top of your views
Unstoppable dudes
Using third optical tools
To Rakaa few crews
You gotta confuse
Melodically
Use rap to sonically bruise cats
Harmonies move over
Chemically glued tracks the ripper

[Marc 7]
Formulated fax center
Orchestrated back bender
Sign, Post, Date and send ya
And take you out like placenta
When I'm in your eye end ya
Blend with the beat like shadows and black ninjas

[Akil]
Me the epicenter
When I'm rocking the mike
I'm from the earthquake state
Shakin' up your life no aftershock
We blow the spot from the top
We have to rock
Ain't that much time on the clock
Kick rocks
Keep it movin' now pick up the pace
We drop and hit the ground runnin'
Winnin' the race
With limited space and limited papes
At any rate we take your mind
To the realest of states
Cuz...

Chorus:
[All]
The flow gon' shine
We blow yo mind
With vocal rhyme
And music from my DJ in the back
Gon' shine
We'll blow your mind
With vocal rhyme
My DJ in the back is gonna
BREAK (scratching)

[All]
Yo, we payin' homage as well as returnin' favors
Candy for your ears hear us now...

[Soup]
I put the Bob in the Bob Diddy
Spit it for y'all city
Use what Allah give me
Flip it if y'all wit me
Kinda black kinda bold
Ghetto soul beautiful
Still in it for you to hold
Cover girl centerfold
My spot, hot like lava rock
I get busy from Panorama City to Lompoc
You prefer hood medic procedure
Poetical breather with fever
Cuz...

Chorus

[All]
There's only one capable
Breaks the unbreakable
Melodies unmakeable patterns
Unescapeable whatever we aim at
We line 'em up
The party is weak from the same rap
Time's up
We payin' homage as well as returnin' favors
Candy for your ear hear us now
Or hear us later
