[Greg Nice]
Get up everybody, it's time to sway OK
Greg Nice is on the mic with no delay
Get up everybody, it's time to sway OK
Greg Nice is on the mic with no delay
She, said, her name was Lola
I, said, yo Lola, swolla
Suave bola, Ayatollah
Saudi Arabia, Coca-Cola
My Rolex watch is ran by solar
Get down, peep my mic technique
Let's freak let's freak let's freak to the beat
Checks get cashed, at the end of the weak
C'mon, Deck the Halls with skins and party
Gainin weight cause I do eat hearty
When I wanna get tipsy I drink Bacardi
Greg Nice, I'm outta here, ghost!

	"I'm on the microphone.." (5X)

[Pete Nice]
Uncle Fester, the baldhead jester
Not me, the Minister, the mic molestor
Five-oh arrest a G, doin ill deeds
Took a hoe to pull out the weeds
Droppin G, the case court is to hobos
Kickin the bobo, chewin on a Rolo
Ain't a Volvo with no paid promos
Sippin cocoa and rollin up momos
Fee fie foe fum I need awake drums
The buns ain't mack cause your breath hums
No Funky Drummer loser pass summons
But you can't stop the +Humrush+ hummings
Like Roto Rooter layin pipes like a plumber
Nice and Smooth cause Three's a prime number
I go brick church buildin when I'm sleepin
So flip off my tip, I rip the mic techniquein

	"I'm on the microphone.." (6X)

[Smooth B]
I praise the Lord that I'm no longer a vandal
Kiss my daughter goodnight, then I light a white candle
and sit back and meditate
Evaluate, appreciate
Cause I didn't have to be here, on wax
Unveling a truth with proof of all facts
Cause in my life I see the life of many others
Various shades of colors, sisters brothers
And once my soul leaves my bodily shell
I believe to receive a new vail
of some concious subconcious abode
chose by few on the positive road
A man is judged by the goodness of his heart
So who's to say who's dumb and who's smart?
Aiyyo Serch (Whattup?)  I came to hear you speak
Get on the mic and flaunt your microphone technique

	"I'm on the microphone.." (7X)

[MC Serch]
Watch me shine til it's time for sundown
I had a scuffle with a kid it only went one round
I got a girl so there's no need to sex a hoe
But I gas em up just like they're at Texaco
Ring goes my phone, so I pick it up and say, "Whattup?"
Somebody's flippin, so I tell him to shut up
We'd use a F word, but Ice Cube got the copyright
so I'll make it +Funky For You+ with Greg Nice
and his partner Smooth B
Watch the Superbowl, just for Bud Bowl III
Then I watch Living Colour, cause "Homey don't play dat"
Money like my honey in my crib and it'll stay that way
The equality variety
You don't like it then you're gonna join the Dead Poet's Society
Try to flip on what this quartet speaks
and Serch will disperse, the microphone techniques

* discussion by the crew over the beat until the end *</pre>
