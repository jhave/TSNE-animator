[Intro]
yo, now its time
I want everybody to listen
Come on
Cause when I get on the mic and do my thing
You need to listen
Reach out and feel this
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Rockin is a state of mind for niggaz who really do it
Leavin suckaz behind and cant move through it
You cut a throat to do better than niggaz doing better
But you can't cut the neck of the second letter
U MP knucks rappers get swung like trucks
Niggaz swearing that he nice when he really suck
And yo ruck why do rappers say they thugs and gangstas
When they halloween dress up nigga panty hose
Acting like he hard with them new edition candy girl flow
Im funky like george sir knows
I'm real like tax time you try to escape
I clamp down on your real estate and your fake estate
That means everything rented borrowed stolen
And anything you might be holdin
I Come like ?? it us
Under pressure buss it
Philly soul reaching
Bumpy heart touching
Jazzy like jeff nigga I'm not a giraffe
Im bumpy abdu jamal I clap you fast
And be dead centre chest like the gold medallion
That hangs around a neck on a old italian

[Chorus]
Scram kid your new to me you bother (that's right its bumpy knuckles)
Cause I know you niggaz really aint thugs
you trying to be hardcore but you really not
I'll write your eulogy you bother me(that's right)
It'll be no help from family or friends
nobody can really help you now

[Verse 2]
Here I am the real emcee
Writing off sucka emcees like I'm dmc
Little killers in the bm 3
Follow one be in the black 600 with the one true v
I'm in V12 but wherever I dwell
They bust for me in heaven they bust for me from hell
Cause I'm still hot any rapper I fear not
I give it to you raw like my pops was gil scott
Mama was jill scott
Humming melodies
My head on her chest feeling the bass in her breast
Time nor space exists for the man
That knows the eternal
Don't make me return you
You can pull it out
Wave it no doubt
But before you bust it off
Heres one to think about
Come to bumpy get your heart tested
If you pass you'll be passing out
I'm blasting in and I'm blasting out

[Chorus]
Scram kid your new to me you bother me (that's right)
Cause I know yall niggaz really aint thugs
you trying to be hardcore but you're not (your not)
I'll write your eulogy you bother me
It'll be no help from family or friends
nobody can really help you now (come on)

[Verse 3]
I'm more convinced now than on a part on my life
That I'm a die with rhyming kids and a rhyming wife
I'm a body every nigga that ever did me trife
That's word to great grand grandma indian and her carving knife
I'm power in its finest hour ask queen latifah
Whose the hardest rap gansgta that she'll ever speak ta
You better check my record
Matter fact check my album industry shook down
Niggaz is shook down
Its time for revolution
Cause I see booty its wax prostitution
'Im the chairmen of busting niggaz with chairs
Cracking niggaz heads open with heineken beers
Most people see my shadow black and wide
But cant see my heart black with pride
Cause you got a devil inside
Plotting for the spot where the late great biggie reside
I be a father like big chuck
Raising my son and keep the enemy close
And bust their gun
I step to a few niggaz and made em all one
With a 16 shot beretta that I call fun
Music must reflect the time time reflect the music
The shorty come correct if you next to use it
From lil bow wow to lil zane
I told lista kane brother little daddy shane
I always spit a nigga name
And hope to god he answer then I get all in his body
Like a nasty cancer
I take honour and take pride in the mic and I fight for it
Like it was a civil rights baby

[Chorus 2x]
Scram kid your new to me you bother (bumpy knuckles)
Cause I know yall niggaz really aint thugs
you trying to be hardcore but you really not (not baby)
I'll write your eulogy you bother me
It'll be no help from family or friends nobody can really help you now

Scram kid your new to me you bother
Cause I know you niggaz really aint thugs
you trying to be hardcore but you really not (your not)
I'll write your eulogy you bother me
It'll be no help from family or friends nobody can really help you now
