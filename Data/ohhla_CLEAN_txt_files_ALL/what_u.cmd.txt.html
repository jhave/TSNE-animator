[C-Murder talking]
Now what chu' niggas really gonna do if we come for you
Huh, what chu' really gonna do niggas
It's real out here

[Ms. Peaches talking]
Who's that sayin' they want to test C-Murder man
Say, you don't know, he's original thug boy
And he's a murderer

[Hook: Ms. Peaches]
What chu' gonna do when we come for you
Cause ya niggas don't fuck with TRU
Now we gotta play it raw my nigga
Fuck the law my nigga, it's on my nigga
What chu' gonna do when we come for you
Cause ya niggas don't fuck with TRU
Now we gotta play it raw my nigga
Fuck the law my nigga, it's on my nigga

[C-Murder]
Play it raw, so raw, I'm in the car with a gar
What chu' see is what chu' saw but chu' better play us par
Cut cha' law and ya paw, my temper hot like tar
I'm on the block posted up, with them things loaded up
And if them people pull up and tell my boys to freeze
Buckle up, knuckle up screamin' C-P-3
Gangsta, gangsta whodi, what cha' gonna do
TRU shawty boy, I love them shawty girls too
Cause cash rules everything around me
I'm uptown, ghetto bound with my rounds G
Slugged up, tatted up, Cut Boys don't give a what
We roll with big trucks, whodi throw yo hood up

[Hook]

[Silkk the Shocker]
Some dudes think it's bout rap, look it's bigger than that
The real be up front, you fake dudes get in the back
We got guns and believe me you can get it from that
Gotta lot of money and mostly I ain't get it from rap
You think it's a game cause we ain't jacked in a while
I bust caps in the Y, funny that's why we crackin' a smile
Glad to shut chu' up, cause that's too loud
Don't mess with that file cause that's a while
Still roll through the hood, Bentley with the top off
Feel me, I'm not gon' stop so you can hop on
Man we got bullets that skip playas and hit haters
Slikk and C, No Limit known to get paper

[Hook]

[C-Murder]
What chu' gonna do when we take that beef to far, yeah
My click of hitmen will catch you in ya car, yeah
Shoot out the window of a black Lex, so roll down
When I slow down, they bout to go down, so put cha' holo-co down
You about to catch a hollow from about no tomorrow
With notes I wrote and my gats not borrowed
So I'ma dump it after I dump in you, ya chump you
I been TRU and plus you only seen what I done been through

[Master P]
Here we go again (What man)
From the streets to the pen (That boy been to the pen)

[C-Murder]
Them boys is at it again (Sho')
TRU Records came to represent (C-Murder)

[Master P]
No Limit
No Limit

[Hook with Master P ad-libs]

[Ian Lewis to fade]
We drink Cristal, enough Alize
And our Lexus Jeeps, say must stay paid
We party all night till the break of day
TRU is our family and we here to stay
We drink Cristal, enough Alize
And our Lexus Jeeps, say must stay paid
We party all night till the break of day
TRU is our family and we here to stay
Can't stop, can't stop, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
Can't stop, can't stop, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
We drink Cristal, enough Alize
And our Lexus Jeeps, say must stay paid
We party all night till the break of day
TRU is our family and we here to stay</pre>
