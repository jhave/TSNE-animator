[Intro: Rupee]
Salaam Remi, Rupee, Lil' Kim, The Queen Bee, to the club, uh, to the club

[Verse 1: Rupee]
Outside inside the place it rammed, dancefloor tight but we don't give a damn
Man hold yuh gal, gal hold yuh man and
Do the damn thing, do the damn thing
Pop, that, Cris, no work tomorrow and you know I ain't drivin
Excuse, me, miss, tell me what's your name and tell me what your drinkin
No, sleep tonight, party goin on til six in the mornin
The dancefloor's tight
Yo! Just the way we like it everybody's jumpin

[Chorus: Rupee]
Get your freak on, do what you want, gal move your waist, give me a taste
Get your freak on, do what you want, mash up di place, give me a taste

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim] (Rupee)

I do the damn thing like a dancehall queen
Dudes on me like a dancehall scene
Me and my girls we like a dancehall team
Droppin that ass like we at the Sunsplash
Bossmen pop Cris if the money done spent
If they rather drink Coronas then Seagram's Gin
We don't leave the party til the damn thing end
And back the next day and do the damn thing again

[Chorus: Rupee]
Get your freak on, do what you want, gal move your waist, give me a taste
Get your freak on, do what you want, mash up di place, give me a taste

[Verse 3: Rupee]
Outside inside the place it rammed, dancefloor tight but we don't give a damn
Man hold yuh gal and gal hold yuh man and
Do the damn thing, do the damn thing
Outside inside the place it rammed, dancefloor tight but we don't give a damn
Man hold yuh gal and gal hold yuh man and
Do the damn thing, do the damn thing
The sun is up, after the show it is the afterparty

People everywhere, tomorrow night we do the same thing again

[Chorus: Rupee]

Get your freak on, do what you want, mash up di place, give me a taste
Get your freak on, do what you want, gal move your waist, give me a taste
