	 Finesse? (Yeah baby?) Oh it's like that now?  (Repeat 4x)

I like my girls strong and solid
Whether they're loyal or have bones in their closet
I want one with better sense that keep dead presidents
And know what to do when she comes to my residence
Whether you're a virgin or the average whore hopper
I take 'em all, even females with the door knockers
I'm a get mine, let all the men sleep
Girls, don't run that shit that beauty's only skin deep
Cause I don't want no girl with a Brillo face
Or the type that leave jheri curl juice on my pillow case
I'm a let you know for girls that need a head start
To lose some fat, a few pounds, and some stretch marks
I want a female that has a mind on track
And still looks good without the makeup or contacts
The type that keeps her business a secret
And has a body others can't compete with
Crazy fine, big behind
Work all day, come home, cook, the whole nine
A female that's also inclined to rap
Make the fellas say (Yo, where did you find her at?)
That's the female that the fellas be peeping
Hanging with the rest of the girls every weekend
Guys want to rap to her, sweat her and run after her
She got it going on with a future in back of her
Far from chubby, scarred, or ugly
I rate her a 10 because damn she looks lovely
She got a chest that can elevate any shirt
She makes heads move when she's wearing a miniskirt
She's full grown, got everything sewn
Crazy smart with a mind of her own
She stands alone when compared to all the rest
That's a girl made strictly for Lord Finesse
She looks good and got everything on tune
Yeah, I like my girls with a boom

	(Look at shorty) (She's not my type)
	 Finesse? (Yeah baby?) Oh it's like that now?  (Repeat 4x)

Come party and hoe with this gigalo soloist
Strictly for the ladies and far from a chauvenist
I like girls from around the way
In tight jeans or miniskirts or some lounge array
I need a female with more shape than an S-curl
So when the crew see her they go (Yeah, that's Finesse's girl)
I like them light skinned, hair color mustard
(What about her?) Nah, she looks busted
I'm just playing so don't think I'm predictable
Cause light skinned or dark skinned I still wanna get with you
No need to front whether older or younger
I don't discriminate because age is just a number
Dating a girl younger than me, that might seem cooler
But I'll be damned to go to jail for a preschooler
I want a hottie, smart not snotty
The one that didn't bring a man to the party
Makeup, extentions?  That's not necessary
I'll take you in whether a maid or a secretary
Or a McDonald's worker, or a receptionist
Cause I'm a specialist for those that step to this
There's so many girls, I don't chase after one hoe
Pimping ain't easy but I find it quite fun, though
I don't like a girl that be hanging with a slut group
I can't sport a female who scores out a buck tooth
I need a female I can sport when I'm outdoors
I'm not choosy, I got a rep to look out for
Like I said before, you have to be into rap
(There's a problem) Hey, I can live with that
I'm 21, out for fun
Ugly girls are okay, but I won't go out with none
Cause as soon as I date them or as soon as I get them
(Ewwww, who's that girl Finesse got with him?)
So you see, I can't just date anyone
But for now I just stick to the pretty ones
The ones crazy cool, looking all smooth
The female that make all the fellas go "Oooohh"
(Finesse is choosy) That's what you all assume
Nah, I like my girls with a boom
