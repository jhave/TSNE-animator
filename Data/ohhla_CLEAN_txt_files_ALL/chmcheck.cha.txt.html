[Chamillionaire - talking]
We in the building
Naw we ain't in the building, we in the streets
And right now we taking over the South, one city at a time
From Houston to Harlem, I'm riding shotgun with the number one DJ in the South - DJ Smallz
Right now you're listening to the official Chamillionaire mixtape mayne
You know what it is, Chamillitary mayne
Fear Factor Music, Smallz let's kill 'em again
And then dig 'em up and kill 'em again, haha
