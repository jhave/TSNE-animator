Cheryl "Salt" James &amp; Rufus Blaq:

You can buy that
Full of bass and hi-hat
You can buy that
Full of bass and hi-hat

Cheryl "Salt" James &amp; Rufus Blaq:

I'm-ah make you bounce till your hip hurts
Make you work
Sweat till you drench your blouse, and your skirt
And I'm-a freak you till you pass out
Pay cash out, baby tear your back out
Keep bangin'
Ho, B.L.A.Q. make you say, ho
S and P, chi-ca, chi-co
Everybody put your hands in the sky
Gitty up, gitty up, let's ride

Chorus:

Gitty up baby (Gitty up, gitty up), say what
Give me all that you got, baby don't stop
Keep it comin' strong, make it hot, say what
Gitty up baby (Gitty up, gitty up), say what
Give me all that you got, baby don't stop
Keep it comin' strong, make it hot, say what

Cheryl "Salt" James:

Gitty up baby, I'm-ah take you for a ride
It makes your soul wild, when I release vibes
Freak ya down, 'til your asthma hit ya
Salt, non-stop styles, lift ya
Make you wanna get your stash
Rollin' like a Ben, no need
Got my own end, payer-haters never win
Cuz I'm involved to the end
Send chill up your skin, Poppie
Who debate, not me
Can't take what I got, can't stop me
You still divide by, bass slide
Yo, can't fight it, ho, let's flow run and move
Show and prove, we can do this
Shake your groove thing, hold tight
Ain't nothin' to this
When they get down with skills
Romance and no frills, uh
It feels ill, don't it

Chorus

Sandra "Pepa" Denton:

I keep it hot like a block full of hustlers
Who can make it blaze like us
Bless you to death
Wanna freak me from the back (Girl, don't even play like that)
Keep it comin' strong, give me all that you got (Yo, true baller don't stop)
I throw it like a pitcher, let my sex appeal hit ya
Game so sharp that it split ya, tell ya what
Keep a stylin', boy (I ain't been hooked since Yin was a hoiler, what)
Can't nobody do it this tight (Say what)
Pep be the bomb, that's right (What)
Look at all the players tryin' to get with me, sit with me
Yo, it ain't shh to me
I'm-ah party 'til I see the sunrise
It hurts to keep the party live
Keep it comin' baby

Chorus

Rufus Blaq:

Gitty up baby
Give me that S and P, that's who the funk is for
Give me that S and P, that's who the funk is for
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me the funk, that's me

Deidra "Spinderella" Roper:

S to the P-I-N, spare with a rella
Ain't no fella, uh, well a
Freak your body, keep the party hot
Give me all that you go,t and it don't stop
When it moves down on me
Put your grooves down, homie
Can't lose now, come on
Can you break it down to the bone
Boo you actin' like you grown
Before I take you home (Watch out)
You better move

Chorus

Gitty up baby

You can buy that
Full of bass and hi-hat
You can buy that
Full of bass and hi-hat</pre>
