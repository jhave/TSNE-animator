[Verse 1 - Kelis]
He has an appetite, for sex and cash
He hangs on the corner, talking trash
Or rollin', in his freak mobile
Mercedes Benz, on 20 inch wheels
Gets calls all day, on his cellular phone
From nasty girls, they won't leave him alone
He's got 'em cryin', 'cause they can't see
Why he's in love, with a girl like me
Innocent, kinda polite
The kinda girl, that says her prayers at night
He picks me up, everyday from school
And all my friends, they just dream and drool
And on the way, the music blasts
We hit my street, he lets off the gas
Just before, my house appears
He pulls over, and whispers in my ear

[Chorus - Pharrell]
Hey little mama let me in your world
I just wanna see you be a nasty girl
I said love you up and love you down
Daddy wanna make love all around town
You scream, ahhh
Come moan and moan and moan, ahhh
Come moan and moan and scream, ahhh
Come moan and moan and moan, ahhh
Now take it back girl

[Verse 2 - Kelis]
My mom's met him, my dad refused
Yesterday, he brought me some shoes
Dolce, and Gabbana
And a bag made of Iguana
And a blazer, and a chocolate tie
Get it blaze, chocolate tie
So this kept on, and it kept on
Like the beat don't stop, until the break of dawn, c'mon

[Bridge - Kelis]
I can't help it
I just love the boy
I just love the boy
Wait a minute, oh
I can't help it
I just love the boy
I just love the boy
Oh no

[Verse 3 - Kelis]
I got shining things, like diamond rings
And designer chains, man the way I bling
Had teachers from school, callin' home
Mr. and Mrs. Nice, what the hell's going on
I snatched a letter, from your daughters desk
From her bad boyfriend, who was talking fresh
How he wants to see her, later today
Face to face, so he can say

[Chorus - Pharrell + Kelis]
Hey little mama let me in your world
I just wanna see you be a nasty girl
I said love you up and love you down
Daddy wanna make love all around town
You scream, ahhh
Come moan and moan and moan, ahhh
Come moan and moan and scream, ahhh
Come moan and moan and moan, ahhh
Now take it back girl

[Verse 4 - Malice]
But you gotta know that the dough comes first
Gotta know if you stray, then no, there are no words
Ma look, I can see it in your face, aww look
Thought I was a nice guy, huh, nah look
You say you'd never leave me love
Well, are you sure that its me you love
Gotta ask, 'cause I can't tell, if it's me, or the B-12
Hell, its suspect but you'll swallow my pride, now let's ride

[Bridge x2 - Kelis]
I can't help it
I just love the boy
I just love the boy
Wait a minute, oh
I can't help it
I just love the boy
I just love the boy
Oh no
