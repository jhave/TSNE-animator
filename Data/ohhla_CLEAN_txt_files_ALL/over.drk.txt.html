[Drake]
Uhh (uhh)
Young Money (Young Money)
Yeah (yeah)

[Chorus: Drake]
I know way too many people here right now 
that I didn't know last year; who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights 
we've been everywhere and back but, I just can't remember it all
What am I doin? What am I doin?
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin me
I'm doin me, I'm livin life right now mayne
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Drake]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck is y'all thinkin?
Makin sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin
'Bout to +Set it Off+ in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn'ta drove, tell me how I'm gettin home
You too fine to be layin down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
'Bout to go +Thriller+ Mike Jackson on these niggaz
All I need's a fuckin red jacket with some zippers
Super good smid-oke, a package of the swishers
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
Y'all know them? Well fuck it, me either
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it
Throwin hundreds when I should be throwin ones, bitch I run it - ah!

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Uhh, one thing 'bout music when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end gettin any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm ridin through the city with my high beams on
Can ya see me? Can ya see me? Get yo' Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn yo' widescreen on
If you thinkin I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Yeah, that's right, I'm doin me
I'm doin me, I'm livin life right now mayne
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over, uh</pre>
