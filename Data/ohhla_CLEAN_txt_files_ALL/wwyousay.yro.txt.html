[O.G. Ron C - talking]
Ye, put it in ya face like that, huh
It's the color changin' click
Yung ro, nobody, O.G. Ron C, wreckin' yard

[Hook- Yung Ro]
Many rappers, act gangsta on beats
Change ain't ya mission, can't hang in the streets
Betta watch what you say, when you rap on these beats
Cause you might have to prove it one day
I put a hole in a rapper, for messin' wit me
Paid in full, color changin click or nobody
And I dare a punk rapper, to start dissin' me
Cause I'll come, and eat ya artists up
I'ma cool cat, and I don't really start no plex
I got money on mind, problems, and stress
And I dare a punk rapper, to start dissin' me
Cause Yung Ro comin' straight from
Many rappers, act gangsta on beats
Change ain't ya mission, can't hang in the streets
Betta watch what you say, when you rap on these beats
Cause you might have to prove it one day
I put a hole in a rapper, for messin' wit me
Paid in full, color changin click or nobody
And I dare a punk rapper, to start dissin' me
Cause I'll come, and eat ya artists
I'ma cool cat, and I don't really start
I'ma cool cat, and I don't really start no plex
I'ma cool cat, and I don't really start no plex
I got money on mind, problems, and stress
And I dare a punk rapper, to start dissin' me
Cause Yung Ro comin' straight from the streets

[Yung Ro]
Come on dawg, I know you don't wanna be another rapper dead
Shot in the head, dead and gone, behind some fuck you done said
Everybody rappin' gangsta, ain't really a gangsta
Not even me, but I never really said I was gangsta
I'ma man, and I ain't gotta say or prove shh
My homie cat say he ain't a gangsta, just do gangsta shh
So that mean we don't look for trouble, but you still can get popped
But you know all the famous rappers, they died gettin' shot
So when you see that red beam, and hear that cock I got ya
And you can run and tell the police, that nobody shot ya
Homie, tell the truth, how many people you killed
Y'all promotin' gangsta, like bein' gangsta is real
Nah, tell the truth, I seen a lot of rappers
And you can see it in they eyes, if they some gangsta or actors
And when you see me, I'm happy, smilin' wit a glock
Cause I'ma be me regardless, hard times or not
I'ma grown ass man, depend on nobody else
And I don't pack a glock for promotion, I'm protectin' myself
They say commercial rap is weak, and he gangsta he hard
Yeah he rhyme, but he just killed thirty people in sixteen bars
Do you even take the time, to rewind yourself
Y'all sound like lost kids, y'all need to find y'all self
See me, I'm nobody, on top paid in full
And it be them quiet humble ones, that will pop yo skull
And I'ma check the rap game, cause it needs some help
My last words to the people, is y'all be ya self
