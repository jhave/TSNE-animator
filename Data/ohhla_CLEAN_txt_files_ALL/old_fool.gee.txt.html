Song:   (You Ain't Just a Fool) You's an Old Fool
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

Well, well, well..
There's that old man again
Runnin around with those young girls
Man, if he only knew how he looked
He look just like a fool

(But you's an old fool)		(3x)
(To the beat y'all)

(You ain't just a fool
But you's an old fool)		(2x)

[ VERSE 1 ]
You give her all your money and all of your time
And at the end of the week you ain't got one dime
To spend; you say you love her, she makes you feel young
But this only proves one thing: that you's a dumb-dumb
'Age's just a number', now gimme a break
She's only 16 and you're 68
Mistake, and plus you're married till death do us part
Soon as you see a young lady, you're ready to start
Flirtin, keep late hours at home and on the telephone
Talkin to the girl while you think she's alone
But she's not, she's with another guy
And if you knew, you'd die
She said, "This is my friend," you said, "How you're doin"
You ain't just a fool, but you's an old fool

(But you's an old fool)		(3x)
(To the beat y'all)

(You ain't just a fool
But you's an old fool)		(2x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
You're wastin your time, plus you're livin a lie
Because you'll never be able to compete with the other guy
Cause you're much too old, he's much younger
To her you're like drizzling rain, but he's thunder
Now you tell me, who do you think she'll choose
I bet you nine times out of ten you lose
But you can win your wife cause she'll be with you for a lifetime
But you don't want that, you rather ride a baby
Why don't you go home and eat some gravy train
That's dog food, that's what you deserve
If it was my daughter, brother, you would get served
There's no excuse, cause as a man you can fight that
Thank my Heavenly Father I ain't like that
You ain't just a fool, but you's an old fool

(But you's an old fool)		(3x)
(To the beat y'all)

(You ain't just a fool
But you's an old fool)		(2x)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now you told the girl to meet you at a disco spot
You dyed your hair and moustache to get a better shot
When you walked through the door, thought you was cool
Meanwhile behind your back she's callin you a fool
Wearin those old clothes that's older than me
You see, she wanted to laugh, you just couldn't see it
She said, "I'm leavin for business, meet me at my place"
You gave her 50 dollars and a 10 dollar chase
See, you waited all night, preferably into the morning
She came in all rubbled, stretchin and yawnin
You said, "I need some lovin," she said, "It's too soon
But here's a pillow, so you can sleep in the living room"
You ain't just a fool, but you's an old fool

(But you's an old fool)		(3x)
(To the beat y'all)

(You ain't just a fool
But you's an old fool)		(2x)</pre>
