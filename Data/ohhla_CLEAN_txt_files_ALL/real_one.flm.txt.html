[Verse One]
From these times now and back down to Biblical days
Counterfeit Jesus' have raised in the ages
Searched the pages of the Biblion the Holy Bible not the holy quran
No, Jesus warns us what would come after
Matthew the 24th chapter
"For many will come in my name sayin' 'I am the Christ'"
But they're really actors
Woe unto those who chose and teaches
A non-Biblical Jehovah Jesus
Woe, they might use the name but read in anotha' meanin'
We must put a stop to the doctrine of demons
I must run this it might get hostile
We don't want the Christ of Oneness Pentecostals
We want the incarnate Christ of the apostles
The pre-existent Son, the One of the gospel

[Hook]
We want the Real One, I teach the GodMan homie
Represented through Christians is the real Jesus
We want the Real One, I preach the GodMan whoodi
Represent the authentic and real Jesus
We want the Real One, I teach the GodMan son
Represented through Christians is the real Jesus
We want the Real One, I preach the GodMan dirty
Represent the authentic and real Jesus

[Verse Two]
You're bound to drown in a broken ship
If your hope is in the Jesus of Joseph Smith
Woe, that doctrine will have your life stormin'
Come to the knowledge of Christ not to the one of the Mormons
Jesus is not Lucifer's spiritual brother
And the heavenly Father did not have sex with his mother
Mary, scary I seen them two dudes in my hood
Tellin' me God was a man at first and progressed to His Godhood
No, eternal is the Godhead
The Father has always been God that's what the 90th Psalm says
Keep your eyes on Jehovah's witness
Who mistranslates 1:1 of John in the Holy Scriptures
They say more to get your mind tangled
They deny Jesus is God but the incarnate Michael the archangel
If no angel was called the Son in Hebrews 1
Then why is Jesus called the Son</pre>
