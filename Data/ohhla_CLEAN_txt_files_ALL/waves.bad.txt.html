[Intro]
Yeah! You remember back in the days when you use to rock waves and shit?
When like, yo I had I had the fuckin 360 my nigga
Like nobody in the hood was fuckin my shit, and that's the real shit

[Verse One]
Uh! Since nine five, mama been workin nine five
And I know the landlord fed up with our lies
So we pray to the Gods, the Jahs and the Allahs
To keep us safe and watch our lives 
'Cause all we tryin to do is do good
Put on my hood when I walk through hoods
'Cause, these niggas these days is loco
You'll get in ya vocals if you ain't local
Yeah, that's why I'm tryin to go global
Yeah, that's why I'm tryin to be a mogul
And I'm hopeful that me spittin it soulful 
Will have me in the Daily Postal flyin coastal eatin tofu
Like I told you I know niggas who trash rappin
Worried 'bout the trendin fashions rather than ascendin passion
They want me send 'em tracks but I just send 'em laughin
Right after I start laughin, they askin what happened?
But back to the chapter
Mama told me follow my dreams, should never have to ask her, to
So that's what I do, become an MC master
Since then it's been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper
Go ahead ask 'em, who is Joey Bad?
Watch 'em grasp, asthma, damn it's so sad
He paused the chatter, 'cause he know he rather back up
Then to admit the kid is hotter than magma
But fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due
'Cause you ain't 'gon like the karma when it's set up on you
It can get you on your medical, fuck you up in your decimals
Or get you two to three for residue found it your retinue
Uh! And they told me not to be so complex
And The Source, alfredo of course
There I go again, steppin out of line, runnin off course
I heard reports that it's like sexual intercourse
With your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walk
For it is not faux, nor false that this kid from the north
Speaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults
I'm sure by now you can assume he never lost
Unless with some form of divorce, or a corpse
Born boss no days off, child labor
Let me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes
Yeah!

[Interlude: Interview from 2Pac]
What, what the rap audience ain't ready for is a real person
You know what I wanna say, a real n-i-g-g-a
I'm comin at 'em a hundred percent real, I ain't compromisin nothin
Anybody that talk about me got problems you know what I'm sayin?
It's 'gon be straight up like if I was a street person
That's how I'm comin at the whole world and I'm bein real about it
And I'm a grow with my music

[Verse Two]
Yeah! But it's far from over
Won't stop 'til I meet Hova and my mama's in a rover
'Til I'm an owner, of the world's illest motors
I blow like super novas in your daughter's room on a poster
Known as history's biggest musical composer
No disrespect to Bob Mar, but yeah, another stoner
Marijuana my odor, and when I get older
Hope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum
Like three times, have three kids, I hope
Me and my wife can show 'em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did
I hope that they acknowledge the knowledge 'cause yeah, they 'gon need it
'Cause when my parents tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive it
Couldn't believe it, 'til I saw with my own pupils
Felt bad when I learned their advice was truly useful
But fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutual
Even though over time, my punishments they grew more crucial
Should use the word brutal, 'cause my parents mad strict
Hope one day I'll attract the likes of even Madlib
Go gold on mad shit and hear my songs mastered
Until then, all I can do is imagine

[Outro]
Imagine, I'm a make it all happen</pre>
