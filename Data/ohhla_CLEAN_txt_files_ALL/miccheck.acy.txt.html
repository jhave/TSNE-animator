Song:   Mic Check
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all
 - a one two, a check a one two
If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
 - a check two, a mic a check two
If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all
 - a one two, a check a one two
if it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
 - a one two, and I'm a check you

I start most of my raps off kinda slow
just so you could see exactly where it gonna go
I make sure your body's strapped in
cause I'ma tailspin and you're liable to get thrown
The bible is the microphone; I read from the scripture
leave it up to you to see the pictures
I hover above MC's like a flying saucer
with the sorcery to alter the future 
present and the past, don't be hesitant to ask
me to be the man I'll be the last
I'll be movin fast on that ass, I stipulate your fate 
I take a grip I'll take a shot I'll break your plates
Now can you take the weight or do I have to make it lighter tighter
than you could imagine that I had to been when I recite a rhyme
I might as well be inside of your mind
I know you thinkin, "Damn!  How does he?  What was he a man
or a machine with computerized diagrams?"
I tell em, "Nope! I am of the flesh, fresh, dope"
I'm set apart you're just a shot in the dark
and the darkness casts no shadow
And I'll be victorious, no matter who I battle
So every rapper in the house shut the fuck up!

Cause if it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
 - check one, check two
If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all
 - check a one two check a one two
If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
 - a check one check two now I check you

Now everyone knows I got the Milk like D, homemade quilt
to get your wig peelt, like it should be
Top o' the mornin to ya, it's so many ways to do ya
I offer you the shield, just before I deal on ya
I recommend, that when I squeeze the puss from your skin
you pretend it ain't happenin
Cause everywhere is my stompin grounds
When MC's stepped in I stomp em down to the lowest
You the slowest rapper that I met, but you owe us all a favor
not to, jet (nah you ain't goin nowhere)
not until you show us you be flippin
I give your body lashes and whippins
T crashes the board like Pippen, I has to be trippin
Not for your pleasure or your entertainment I came with
a crew called self, and everybody looked just like me
And we agreed that we dope fool
We got flavor and everyone knows who's the saviour
Cause everyone knows, everyone knows
Everyone knows I got flow

And if it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all
 - a one two, a check a one two
If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
 - a check two, a mic a check two
If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all
 - a one two, a check a one two
If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
 - a one two, and I'ma check you

See the mic check brings all the chaos to order
I conquer the perimeter sealing the borders
to catch the feeble child weeble wobble style evil subject
Too deadly ready to wreck, anyone in my way
I am what is know as the expandable specimen
not understandable when I handle my mic check
I enlarge to full capcacity drasticallly fast
it has to be my well manicured dastardly pure blast
will sniffle and lift, level and shift, earthplates 
Speeded up birthrate repetitive let it live then let it die
Right inside the eye of the negative
I love puttin pressure on the lesser competitive
Inferior you're determined, vermin, sherman stick smoked
I got the elephantitus styles superior stroke
of genius, I spoke and hell broke loose
I saturated the streets, 'fatuated by drum beats
My heat, so-lar, warms the po-lar
Melting glaciers, I are shooting star chaser
The laser beam on my hip swings when I rip
Fully loaded electricity clips I can't miss
stimulating your body fluids to flow as well as I do
I do what is necessary to counter the blockage
I can just rocket/rock-it with no fuel, dual exhaust
is costing your life renewal
I bring about a change meanin I'm about as strange as they come
I come from the depths and wish they slept none son
I am I was I be because I'm me
originality for your fatality
Now I am a traveler word scambler
not a scribbler or a scavenger, eatin the place
You're greedy and feedin your face, cause you're needin a taste
of this niceness, but my advice is don't imitate
my likeness, oh I'ma fella who knows what the
mic is, and I do it somethin like this

And if if wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all
 - check one check two now I'm through with you
