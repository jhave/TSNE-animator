* I'm Kurious!!! * (2X)
"I wanna know what's on your mind.."

[Kurious]
One two check, start the analysis
Why am I placed, in a situation wack as this?
Enquiring minds want to know; Kurious Jorge
Creativity from the mind and then so
At times I think I'm nice, clutch my genitalia
With the type of rhymes, that'll derail ya
Train of thought, 2-3 Uptown
On the iron horse, self esteem slows down
A humble type of fella, I count my blessings troop
But I'm countin more blessings than I count loot
Got a heart full of kindness, pocket full of lint balls
Everywhere I go yo, try and avoid the pitfalls (damn)
I understand, things don't come easy
Try to stay away from those who's sleazy
Ways portrays it reflects on the business
I wanna know (why Jorge?) cause I'm Kurious

* I'm Kurious!!! * (4X)
"I wanna know what's on your mind.."

[Kurious]
Am I to think I'm all that cause my rocket's on the rise?
(Hell no) With the surface, I still got ties
Besides what goes up, has got to come down
I know the day'll come when I'm broke and back around
my old block cool, cause I love everyone
From my man Big Tone on down to Little Damien
And then I'm thinkin of the past, remiscin on a 40
Alcoholism started back when I was shorty
I praise the Lord, my soul to keep
And think of how peaceful it is when I sleep
Cold lampin in my rest, all the stress and pain
Combination for success, razor and a vain?  (chill)
Maybe.. but my inner self saves me
Got me in control, when I'm feelin crazy
Peace to my mother, you know I love ya
And to my dog Sampson, I love you too

* I'm Kurious!!! * (4X)
"I wanna know what's on your mind.."

	"On the streets, Kurious like Jorge!" -&gt; Pete Nice

[Kurious]
Verse three rolls around, situation's brighter
Easin on the breaks, subject matter's lighter
Kurious Jorge, with a J not a G
A smooth flowin brother and I brought forth the
style that flexes, from here to Texas
Don't own a Lexus, so opposite sexes
commence to diss - why must you be material?
Dissed it cause I flipped it and I ate ya like cereal
Sex ain't literal, no clitoral stimulation
from the tongue, just a rhyme well brung
First class delivery like a Fed-Ex folder
As I look back in the days, I never was a
Casanova type brother, Valentino lover
Nor the fly guy but hey well I tried
Damn hard I must add, listen and trust dad
When he told me, "Yo Jorge, youse a cool mother.."
