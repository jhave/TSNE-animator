Chorus

Shoot you in yo head makin' sure your dead
Everybody's talkin' about the way that you bled
But ain't no rats around because the U is in the clear
So watch yo back mutherfucker cuz I'm creepin' up on ya from the rear

First Verse
{Tec-9}

I'm sick of them mutherfuckers with that ho shit
Make yo self known and stop talkin' from an distance
I remember back to this round 1992
Some niggas called me up sayin' we startin' a group
Yeah I gave it a try but I was in it to win it
Them niggas started somethin' they could not finish
Now I got to move on so I signed with Cash Money
Now I got some niggas who want to look at me funny
But yo I ain't even gonna let them niggas step
If they start to rep I'm gonna rep mutherfucker
I got to set this shit straight now I'm on wax ya want to converse
But I ain't got nothin' to say since ya pissed me off
It's best to get yo monkey ass out of my fuckin' way
A lot of people dislike me but they don't understand
They the one's who really made me you can hate me forever
I'm makin' money from yo head you can take this bounce
To another level Cash Money is in effect If ya got a probelm
Mutherfucker it's yo self you got to check
I represent that fuckin' uptown 
Through the circumstances and the difficulties in the rap game
Niggas be comin' with ho shit makin' it harder for next man
I'm takin' a stand mutherfuck the next nigga
Because ya got a plan with no heart 
I'm only down with them niggas who was down with me from the
Very start ya sayin' this ya sayin' that
The actual fact ya only lookin' for a way out
So back up off me

Chorus

Shoot you in yo head makin' sure your dead
Everybody's talkin' about the way that you bled
But ain't no rats around because Tec-9 is in the clear
So watch yo back mutherfucker cuz I'm creepin' up on ya from the rear

Verse Two
{Lil' Ya}

Damn why they fuckin' with an nigga
Ya not on the map but yet makin' yo name bigger
you and that ho shit you know you don't mean it
But if ya want some drama won't ya step to Ya bitch
Ya talkin' bad about a nigga bitch get yo mind right
Put down yo guns and let's begin to fight
Cuz I'm a gangster and ya know I'm true to the game
Test my nuts anyway to see if I'm lame
I got muscle comin' strong gee 
Tellin' this o'l mark ass gangstas
To back up off me

Chorus

Shoot you in yo head makin' sure your dead
Everybody's talkin' about the way that you bled
But ain't no rats around because Lil' Ya is in the clear
So watch yo back nigga cuz I'm creepin' up on ya from the rear

Third Verse
{Yella Boy}

Now a days I'm comin' round but it's cool ya see
Still a ho ass mutherfuker better act ya like ya know fool
Ya better step correct because I'm gonna put yo ass in check
Comin' stompin' out the third you the "U" is in effect
Nigga I still thought niggas livin' violent kimo by by my side
If ya ever slip my pass that mean yo ass want to die
i'm tellin' you like this cuz yall niggas makin' me pissed
Ya fuckin' with the Cash Money ya gonna get yo damn head split
Jealous bitches here boo-koo jealous bitches there
My nigga Lil' Slim say shake yo ass up in a minute
Bitch I started off strong I bet ten that's how finish
What kind of nigga try'na go for his bitches be try'na stop me
All upset they need to find them some dick
But I'm gonna let the fuckin' pressure grow
Suckin' makin' me strong slippin' with that ho shit
Don't ya know I got pussy c'mon to me bitches on my 
Dick and that is that B-32 and Suga Fingers keepin' things tight
That's an fact (Yeah) I got the six and b mob by my side
So watch yo back here come an mutherfuckin' drive by
Loadin' the gat's we got to be strapped packin' the gat's 
Can't get trapped steppin' hos checkin' a nigga with my bozack
Why I got to keep on tellin' you not to battle me
When ya know one thing that you can never pay me back
So bitch get off me

Chorus

Shoot you in yo head makin' sure your dead
Everybody's talkin' about the way that you bled
But ain't no rats around because Yella boy is in the clear
So watch yo back mutherfucker cuz I'm creepin' up on ya from the rear


Shoot you in yo head makin' sure your dead
Everybody's talkin' about the way that you bled
But ain't no rats around because the U is in the clear
So watch yo back mutherfucker cuz I'm creepin' up on ya from the rear
