Song:   Can I Be the One
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Can I be the one you call on
Can I be the one if I fall off
I can call on you,
Can I be the one who loved you
Ain't got time no waste baby
Tell me what's you gonna do
Can I be the one, Can I be the one, Can I be the one
Can I be the one, Can I be the one, Can I be the one
Can I be the one who loved you
Ain't got time no waste baby
Tell me what's you gonna do

[Verse 1]
Can I be the one, numero uno
And everytime we go out we kick it like judo
You know, we spending pesos
We getting cake baby, we study non hoes
Ye there, so pull up in the rose
They wearing cheap shots, you wearing the ro-Lex
Damn we got some good sex
Born in the suburbs, but you head came from projects
Like a dope fiend, I'm fiending for you baby
And for your body I be scheeming for you baby
And when you not around I be dreaming for you baby
And right now you got me singing for you baby

[Chorus]
Can I be the one you call on
Can I be the one if I fall off
I can call on you,
Can I be the one who loved you
Ain't got time no waste baby
Tell me what's you gonna do
Can I be the one, Can I be the one, Can I be the one
Can I be the one, Can I be the one, Can I be the one
Can I be the one who loved you
Ain't got time no waste baby
Tell me what's you gonna do

[Verse 2]
Took that ass up, I'm dancing with it
Let's take it slow, let's get romantic with it
Strawberries, whip cream and some rose petals
Your nigga tryin' to come back but baby don't let him
He fucked up, I locked up
I took his place, now look at the look on his face
He looking crazy, I'm happy baby
You can call me papi, call me papi baby
You've been down with me every since I was trapping baby
You used to bring me plates like shhh, I'm capping baby
Tongue kissing like the movie
You the first one gave me head in my jacuzzi
I'm fucking with you

[Chorus]
Can I be the one you call on
Can I be the one if I fall off
I can call on you,
Can I be the one who loved you
Ain't got time no waste baby
Tell me what's you gonna do
Can I be the one, Can I be the one, Can I be the one
Can I be the one, Can I be the one, Can I be the one
Can I be the one who loved you
Ain't got time no waste baby
Tell me what's you gonna do</pre>
