[Killah Priest]
Pyramid forms, Kufis and dashikis
Books of loose leafs, appear in the tide beach
It's weird, but I'm here, amongst 12 Monks for months
Waitin' on me to write, and the pages they stay blank
For days I think, days turn into years, to engrave my ink
No words, no sounds is heard
Just observe wit the patience of a decade that God has served
Thoughts came slow like a plant when it grows
My brain is the soil, my mind is the hose
It can't hold, sweat drips off my chin
Onto a damp robe, and the flame and lamp goes
The example of a Prophet, a genius, a new Jesus
All of us whisper; "What will he leave us?"
Tension breaks, the look on my face goes
From curious to serious
My arms drop, then my palms jab, the greatest lesson
The answers to age's questions
To keep the ancestors and atheist guessin'
They look inside my book, and the words say...
"Love thy neighbor as I thy would love thyself"
It's Priest, peace, much prosperity and health
