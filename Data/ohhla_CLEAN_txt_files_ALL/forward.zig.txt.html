Album:  Wild and Free
Song:   Forward to Love
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Don't go away, when you know that it feels good
Why don't you stay cause you know what we could do
Baby...
We could get hazy
Hand in hand we feel the vibe
We see true love in our eyes
Baby...
This ain't no maybe

[Chorus]
Forward to love
Forward to love
I know we got something
The feeling is true
And I don't wanna wait another day
To be with you
Baby...
We could get lazy
The spirit has spoke
The voice of the truth
No need to waste time
Lets just do it
Baby...
We could get crazy
Yeah...

[Chorus]
Forward to love
Forward to love
Hard to believe
It shouldn't be this easy
You take the lead
That I wont be greedy
Baby...
I'm in no hurry
What are the odds
A stranger we'll meet
But deep inside
We walked these streets already
And this ain't just lately
Yeah

[Chorus]
Forward to love
I tell ya now
Forward to love

[instrumental solo]

Don't go away, when you know that it feels good
Why don't you stay cause you know what we could do
Baby..
We could get hazy
Hand in hand we feel the vibe
You see true love in my eyes
Baby...
This ain't no maybe
Ahh, yeah

[Chorus]
Forward to love
Everyone now
Forward to love
Come on ya
Forward to love
Everybody sings
Forward to love
Right now
Forward to love
Forward to love
Forward to love
Yeah you're headed my way
Forward to love
Come on come on
Forward to love</pre>
