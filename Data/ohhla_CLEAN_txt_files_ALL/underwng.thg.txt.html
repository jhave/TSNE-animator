[Hell Razah]
She got Manolo toes with coke on her nose
You know them high class hoes, the Marilyn Monroe's
I spit 'Da Vinci Code' the dead street scroll
Niggas starting with beef leaving in peace mode
Until it's knock-knock glock up in their peek hole
I'm in the black turban with by half Germans
Y'all clitoris rap killers even your gat's is virgin
I Human Torch it, my New York hat burning
I think about a thousand degrees at light speed
And show you how to teach your seeds the right trees
And not how to bag up coke and likely
'Cause anything that fall off now is just leaves to me
And from a sacrifice, now would you bleed for me?
I put your body on ice for acting Walt Disney
So walk with me in the flesh like corpse as Kristy
The more 'crisy you drink you getting more bitchy
He went from Frank Nitti son to being Lionel Richie
I fill my suitcase up with nothing but tampons
These niggas waiting for Jay to diss Cam'Ron
Gimme a sixteen bar without a firearm
And I'ma drop that jewel to turn Zion on
I'm broadcasted worldwide on Viacom
You don't wanna shake hands with the lion's claw
You don't even got a clue what you dying for?
But when you do ask God who I'm riding for
The Hebrew port knocking on Heaven's door
The 144 cocking them .44s
I'm original, you? I'm not sure it's yours
A&amp;R's who pass is mopping up the floors
What you bringing to this hip-hop game?
It's just better for the target when I pick my aim
T.H.U.G. Angelz the game, we don't fuck with lames
Young Hannibal of Spain, I don't trip off fame
Heard you had it on smash but it's all gon' change

(Chorus) Razah
Never did a long stretch, names still ring bells in the bing
Put you under the wing

(Chorus) Bazz
Never did a long stretch, names still ring bells in the bing
Bazz and Rubiez put juvi's under the wing

[Shabazz the Disciple]
That Red Hook life we need to dying or adapt to
Niggas got clapped over the size of their capsules
Many were born to their families wearing shackles
We had our gats on our lap at the chapel
Niggas will run up in and a few will clap you
And use your wife to a trap and kidnap you
She led them to the stash where they rushed the castle
Got you indicted under that kingpin's statue

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Brick layers building the treasures, city golden harvest
These memories are what develops platinum and golden artist
Some hood niggas turn exect. when they were on to us
Flipping with that over-act, the money launderers
Fuck you expect from a nigga living check-to-check?
From Red Hook Projects where the billionaires intellect
Had to accustom to the status we accumulated
I don't trust 'em, they trying to get at us, even your womb related
Dudes will send you to the tombs if they assume you made it
Avoid the Tuesday and Thursday brooms, hotel rooms are raided
And presidential terrace's with the better views
War for revenues made the channel 4 seven news
From the block to the cell block - we cali-bangers
And if you cocking on pop-pop - the halo and wing
We pull squeal then we bail hop - where cases linger
And all the hood we salute the cops with middle fingers
My T.H.U.G. nation on parole or probation
'Quip the ice, pick a right, triple life facing
Up in the yard quick to send dope for commissary
Behind bars 'cause of snitches met as promissory
When crime starts you be pitching coke and ganja berries
Them dime jobs got you shitting, broke in solitary
Behind them wires with the desire to ball
Still continuing the criminal empire behind the wall

(Chorus) Razah
