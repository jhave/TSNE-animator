I'ma take you back, take take you back
I'ma take you back, take take you back
I'ma take you back, take take you back
I'ma take you back, take take you back (W-W-W-Way Back!)
I'ma take you back, take take you back
I'ma take you back, take take you back
See, cuz it's twisted..
In the future, scientists will prove that we never even existed

[Verse One]
I got lectured once while eating breakfast for lunch
Said dad to me "Reality is nothing but a collective hunch
Whatever you want the truth to be, simply fool the masses
Attack them mentally with tools of power like the Masters
Get em in elementary school and college classes
Eventually you'll overrule their cowardly asses
Don't worry about society, they're all horrible bastards"
With this knowledge I blast kids. stay dark like Howard's glasses
I'm "Stern!" plus I rule with an iron fist
With no concern, it's so cruel, where did I learn this?
It's in my gene pool. For permanent bliss
It seems cool, only if you suffer from eternal ignorance
Internal innocence rejects external filth. Hurdle the guilt
My ancestors left. Dress with a traditional kilt
Curdled milk that's under suspicion will get spilt
Ain't no use crying. Who's lying about the empire I built?
Another self proclaimed historian
With Einstein as his passenger, and a flux capacitor in his Delorean
Rewrote my past, taught me sin
When we spoke at last he caught me in the chin
There was no need to ask, I know he fought me to win
My broken task is born again, let a new war begin
I think he saw me grin. Played my ass like a sucka
Turned that brunch between me and my father into our last supper

[Chorus]
He'll take us back, take take us back
He'll take us back, take take us back (Take us back back!)
He'll take us back, take take us back
He'll take us back, take take us back (W-W-W-Way Back!)
See, cuz it's twisted..
In the future, scientists will prove that we never even existed

[Verse Two]
So now I'm orphaned into this world of a rewritten past
Where they force my girl to clean and force me to sit in class
The teacher laughs as he preaches math, beats me with a  staff
Because the text we read expects us to bleed each paragraph
I speed through the chapter fast. My prospectful wife
Hangs her pride at half mast, force fed domestic life
Is giving her a fat ass...she can't eat no more
"We'll see who laughs last" is what she speaks so sure
as she sweeps the floor
Her bare feet are sore. I'd massage her toes
But she's way too busy doing dirty laundry and washing my clothes
This bastard ass took us back to the dark ages
My heart races. He's got 1 out of 3 blacks locked in cages
Sage is heading for the mic, but they blocked the stages
Dopes took his notebook, said "Don't look!" as they blotched the page
Ignoramuses must have "idio-dildos" stuck up in their anuses
Dominatrixes explain how pleasurable of a pain this is
I ain't with this game of his.I'm looking for a loophole
Just because you look the part, don't mean you can play, ask Manute Bol
My absolute role is to save whatever is left of me
The last of my true soul, so I dress up like the referee
To get the coach on every bench pissed
They approach me with a clenched fist
So I throw up their past lives and say, "Catch this!"
They get the drift, but fans rush the court
Propaganda programs they hold in their hands
brain washed and flushed their thought
Now it's a blood sport. My girl ain't with this strange land
She was fronting like a cheerleader as she figured out the game plan
Made peeks at play sheets, memorized them like the Rain Man
Conducted her own brain scan, then reversed the chain of command
"She learned the formulas?" The story is unraveling
She seduced Einstein by dressing up like Marilyn..
Monroe. now she's got a Manson look in her eyes
And a grin that's stretching so wide.damn, son, I'm petrified!

[Chorus]
She'll take us back, take take us back
She'll take us back, take take us back (Take us back back!)
She'll take us back, take take us back
She'll take us back, take take us back(W-W-W-Way Back!)
See, cuz it's twisted..
In the future scientists will prove that we never even exsssss....</pre>
