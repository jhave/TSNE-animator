[Hook]
It all started out at a I&amp;E fest
When Grip told Gotti to bump his best
He said "Go Go Gotti, Go Go Go Gotti
Go Go Gotti, Go Go Go Gotti"

Go Gotti go
That's all I know
It started out
In a small project, where i was turning it out
Credit for Grip
He never tripped, he kept it real
Had the bankroll and the knowledge, and I had the skill
I was twelve years old, Grip was fourteen
Grip was gettin' work, I was servin' fiends
I been a wigsplitter, slash money-go-getter
Ever since I was a itty-bitty lil nigga
Thank I was the wisest youngster out there hustlin'
Twelve year old kid on the block cuffin'
Packs in my ass and rocks under my tongue
Gotti ain't doing drugs cause Gotti ain't gettin' sprung
Rappin' came eazy
It was a gift, that I got from Jeezy
I told you once, and you didn't believe me
Now with the help of Grip, it cost to see me
I'm a thug and drugs is what I live by
So if I speak it I mean it, cause I don't liz-ie
When I turned fifteen, I had ten G's
Me and Grip colaborated and bought a key
And for a hobby, you know I was rappin'
But never thought that this CD shit would happen
I dropped my first album, they went crazy
And at random I was fuckin' these nigga's ladies
Don't play no games, and please don't criticize me
Who had a hundred G's, my age, beside me?
I went to school with platinum chains, and platinum grills
A sports car, a big truck on twenty wheels
You won't believe the shit, that I done been through
The cats I roll wit, and who I'm kin to, I'm kin to
