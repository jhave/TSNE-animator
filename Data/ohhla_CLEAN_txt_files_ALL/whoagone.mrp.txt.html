Ugggghhhhh!

[Chorus with ad-libs]
Whoadie gone, what we gon' do now
Whoadie gone, can't stop now
Whoadie gone, what we gon' do now
Whoadie gone, can't stop now
Whoadie gone, what we gon' do now
Whoadie gone, can't stop now
Whoadie gone, what we gon' do now
Whoadie gone, can't stop now

[Verse 1]
Mama cried, shed tears
But whoadie was a dog, he never lived in fear
Real thug figure, straight hard hitter
Whoadie gone, homies pour out a lil' liquor
Can't find the killer, damn and it hurt man
Whoadie on a t-shirt, they dropped him in the dirt man
And the sister, she was trippin' man
Askin' me questions like "Who caught him slippin' man"
Where you at and who around you
I guess she ain't really know the dogs loved you
And a dog'll do anything before you fall
See you in the crossroad, we gon' miss you dog

[Chorus with ad-libs]

[Verse 2]
Same hood that you ride in
Will get you crossed up homie, you'll die in
A couple of dollars get you knocked off
They trippin' on bin Laden, what about these ghetto wars
A lil' homie ain't had a chance
They walk up to his car, killer took him and his girl man
And I wonder if heaven has a special place
If you start off wrong change ya life, do you get a break
Cause every drug dealer don't mean wrong
But narcotics in the ghetto get you scrilla home
And rappers prove their life with nouns and adverbs
Justice of the peace only happens in the suburbs
I pray you give Pac and Biggie a second chance
I wonder if my brother and nephew up there holdin' hands
My uncle died of cancer, is he cured yet
It's a war out here, lil' whoadie took his last breath

[Chorus with ad-libs]

[Master P speaking]
I just want y'all to pause for a minute
And just light ya lighters
Cause I wanna give R.I.P. to my ghetto vets
My lil' brother Kevin Miller, I miss you dog
My lil' nephew Lance Connor
My grandfather, Big Daddy, for teachin' me how to be a soldier
Smile for my uncle, Big Jimmy Keller Senior
Randall Watts, Bruce and Burnell
Y'all back together dog
Dodo, Alfons and Elizabeth
Papa Pen, we keepin' the legacy goin'
I know you up there smilin'
Pissy Bob, Cornell, Rabbit
M and M, Lil' Curl, Hard Trouble
Big Ed, Tupac, Biggie Smalls
Coughnut, Big Pun, Aaliyah, Baby Babe
Baby Girl, Kenny Sell, Meathead
Dip, Lil' Roger
And everybody that lost somebody
From ghettos all across the world
R.I.P. to all the fallen soldiers
Oh yeah, we ain't never gon' forget y'all

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
