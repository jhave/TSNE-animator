Everybody everybody in the place to be
Open up your mind and let your soul be free
I can feel the Most High shining on me, so...
Let's get this party started

Everybody everybody in the place to be
Open up your mind and let your soul be free
I can feel the Most High smiling on me, so...
Let's get this party started

Blind-sided by the blitz, Come on baby it's on
I couldn't wait to get on this, You ain't no quiet storm
I'm gonna tell it like it is, There ain't no stopping us now
Somebody shut me up so I can live out loud

Them people thought I was gone, It's been a long time comin'
But straight out the box, We got the dark side runnin'
So Father, Most High won't You show Yourself
And shine on this record like nobody else</pre>
