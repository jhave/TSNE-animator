Yeah
A classic story be told,
Carmen a hip hopera watch the drama unfold
The tragic tale of a girl
Tryin' to capture the gold
With a free spirit, brothers strady tryin' to hold
What would you do for love? (uh huh)
Is the cost too much?
Or the object of your desire you're tryin' to touch
Sometimes beauty it best observed from a far
Rise and fall with a star, as we face the cause
