[Wyclef]
Yo Whitney and Wyclef
Turn this up you gonna feel it up
Yo if I became broke tomorrow
Would I still be your pharaoh?
Your ghetto Prince of Egypt
And if I got into a motorcycle accident and crashed
And became paraplegic
Yeah and if the feds rush the door
And find guns on the floor
And took us to federal court
Would you say they were yours?
If I had to do a bid
Would you take care of the kids?
And never let another nig in the crib
Keep the kitty licked, yeah

[Whitney](Kristina)
If tomorrow is judgment day (sing mommy)
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say, I spent it with you
If I wake up in World War Three
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I wanna go home
It's okay if you're coming with me

1 -     [Whitney]
         Your love is my love and my love is your love
          It would take an eternity to break us
         And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

Repeat 1

[Whitney]
If I lose my fame and fortune
(It really don't matter)
And I'm homeless on the streets
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station (okay)
It's okay if you're sleeping with me (baby)
As the years, they pass us by
We stay young through each other's eyes
(Each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get, ooh
It's okay as long as I got you, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah

Repeat 1 (2x)

[Whitney]
If I should die this very day
Don't cry cause on Earth
We wasn't meant to stay
And no matter what the people say
(It really won't matter)
I'll be waiting for you
After the judgment day

[Dyme]
Now I lay me down to rest
I pray that life don't get you stressed
If you should cry, if you should break
I pray these streets don't take your life
Means more to me than that Rolley with the plat
Heard that? Believe that, I ain't letting none of that
Go down, when the feds come tell 'em none, they my guns
And if they see me in the streets and wanna take my dough
Take my clothes, for that price you can have my life
Y'all shouting Dyme, that's my name
Chicks spit fire, I'm putting out the flame
For life, wifee, mommy to baby girl
I wouldn't give it up for all the money in the world
Oh my time is up, bricks to Mt. Vernon
Clef and All Star bring in Whitney Houston

Repeat 1 (2x)

[Wyclef] (Kristina)
Collabo, All Star, East Side
Refugee Camp from the basement, West Side
(Clap your hands)
And it don't stop South Side
(Clap your hands)
And me, North Side
(I said the record is not over yet)
(Clap your hands)</pre>
