(Chorus) 
That's the sound of a madman workin' on the chain 
Chain gang 
That's the sound of a madman workin' on the chain 
Chain gang 

(L-Burna) 
Mama told me to keep my head up 
Head up and take as much as I can, can 
Understand, I need a plan, pray and fear no man 
Even though I walk thru the valley of death, i'm a mighty warrior 
When it's the story of one of the last real niggas left 
Nigga, I keep my fo fo fully loaded, with a c-4 and explosives 
If I have to commit that murder, you can believe survival's the motive 
I fear no man, nigga, no machine, nigga, no laws, nigga, no system 
I do what I gotta do, when I gotta do it, make sure you ain't one of my 
victims 
Niggas is talkin', sayin' nothin', so I watch a nigga whole team crumble 
You niggas is P.I.'s , fin to get pee'd on by the king of the jungle 
Nigga, what I bring won't be humble, y'all women and kids won't get no mercy 
Nigga want r-e-s-p-e-c-t, 'cause a nigga in the ghetto thirsty 
Certainly, we all scramblin', gamblin' 
Tryin' to get paid, livin' this shit, been doin' this day by day 
On the race to become that jack of all trades 
Had it all made 
But, nigga, when the tough got goin', and goin' got ghost 
You already know who be thuggin' the most 
City to city and coast to coast 
Soldiers on post, niggas we all strapped 
Nigga, we all rap, and we all bust caps, nigga 
Just gimme your number, nigga, get right back at'cha, partner 
If you're business good, then we'll holler 
Nigga, you about the dollar, pop your collar, nigga 
I fuck with polished niggas and strictly dime bitches 
You think you gon' waste my time, bitches 
You must be outta your mind, bitches 
Niggas on some funky shit, you can quote this shit 
Nigga wrote this shit, i'm on some icy roller coaster shit 
Niggas don't know how low we get 

(Chorus) 
That's the sound of a madman workin' on the chain 
Chain gang 
That's the sound of a madman workin' on the chain 
Chain gang 

(L-Burna) 
Now, it's all about me and my niggas, them one of a kind niggas 
Niggas that'll shoot you in your spine 
Nigga, blaze up and sip some wine, nigga 
Them Bone niggas packin' the chrome 
Nigga, runnin' up in your zone 
Nigga, puttin' a bullet to your dome 
Nigga, screamin', "the war is on, nigga!" 
Now that we aquainted, nigga, i'ma paint this perfect picture 
It's about love, peace and happiness 
Don't let that murder get ya, 'cause, nigga, if it get ya 
Nigga, you got, that's why I live and I live a lot 
I'm in the club with my glock, 
Nigga, I sleeps with my glock, keep it cocked 
Just in case a nigga try to come thru the door and catch me sleepin' 
Wanna see me weak, but, nigga, that's what I be waitin' fo' 
Some people say it's paranoia, but I beg to differ 
Gotta get wit'cha if you think i'ma be that nigga layin' stiff and cold 
I'm fightin' eternal wars 
Let alone society, for the shit I kick they wanna slit my wrists 
These mothafuckas out to quiet me 
They wanted that thugsta music, but we don't surrender 
Far as I see, ain't no contenders 
Nigga, we champions, rebels and winners, nigga 

(Chorus) 
That's the sound of a madman workin' on the chain 
Chain gang 
That's the sound of a madman workin' on the chain 
Chain gang 

(L-Burna) 
I only kick it with my heart to heart niggas 
Mastered the art niggas 
Them niggas that's never gon' fall apart niggas 
Them secret assassin, roll in the dark niggas 
March niggas, it's real, better be ready in the battlefield 
Tell you right now, this ain't no drill, fuckin' around can get you killed 
Ain't no time fin to be wasted, really 'cause a nigga ain't got no patience 
For them stud dummies that be talkin' loud, run around catchin' cases 
Lettin' you know I play for keeps, baby 
And I know can't none of you ho's can save me and fade me 
But nigga, i'm just too deep, baby 
Think Layzie's shady, get a load of Lightning 
Lil' L Burna, with the strength of fifty titans 
All I can see is total choas comin' 

(Chorus) 
That's the sound of a madman workin' on the chain 
Chain gang 
That's the sound of a madman workin' on the chain 
Chain gang 

Mama told me to keep my head up 
Head up and take as much as I can, can 
Understand, I need a plan, pray and fear no man 
I keep my head up 
Head up and take a as much as I can 
Understand, I need a plan, pray and fear no man 
Nigga, pray, fear no man 
Nigga, pray, fear no man </pre>
