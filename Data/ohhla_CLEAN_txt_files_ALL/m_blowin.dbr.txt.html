[Da Brat]
Clap your hands everybody and everybody clap your hands
To the niggas in the back clap your hands
And to the bitches in the front with the blunts its time to dance
So get your ass up out your seats
And get down to the sounds of the B R A T
Now me I be she with the funk
Puttin' the Holyfield beatin on the ass in your trunk
Now as the rhythm and the rhyme connect
Its like asthma motherfuckers gasping for breath
Cuz I'm def so so very its scary
Never teary and what I kick is necessary
Cuz bullshit irritates the ear
That's why I'm here in the clear have no fear
Don't worry cuz everything is fine
Just fire me up and watch you lose your mind

Chorus:
Man:    Mind blowin'...... do do do do do do do
JD:     On and on til the break of dawn 
        See the beats don't stop til the early morn
Man:    Mind blowin'...... do do do do do do do
Brat:   Its like that and as a matter of fact
        When it come to the brat tat tat tat
        I'll make you neck snap back

[Da Brat]
My shit is what the niggas like
Gangsta as funk is all we write
Well it ain't got no slang if it ain't got no funk
And you shit ain't shit if your shit don't bump
Did it bump nigga you know what you bound to get
When you fuckin' with dat shit from a so def bitch
I kick shit in a pitch only cheese can see
Pack funk like sweeninin pack tallacy
Its me that Brat so ease on back
And let me slide on up to the top of the stack 
Fron the westside def side is my crew
Chant a wicked verse and rip your neck off like voodoo
My shit fly shit why should I get 
Mixed in a shovel with these other bitches
Its just me myself my blunts and my click
Blowin' yo mind with some gangsta shit...oh yea

Chorus:
Man:    Mind blowin'...... do do do do do do do
JD:     On and on til the break of dawn 
        See the beats don't stop til the early morn
Man:    Mind blowin'...... do do do do do do do
Brat:   Its like that and as a matter of fact
        When it come to the brat tat tat tat
        I'll make you neck snap back

[Da Brat]
Come on come all to this funkdafied gathering
To see what you ain't seen or go where you ain't been
Its where I take you with my fantastic tactics
Exciting like gymnastics and harder than mathematics
I obliviate the mind leaving you in daze for days
Fucked up by the ways
I play shit complicated but basic
I ain't nothing to fuck with and you gotsta face it
You can't trace cuz ain't no outline you can't out rhyme
You can't route yours like I route mine
Energetical funkadelical made for the radio
Cuz stereo where ever I let it though its on  on
To the break of dawn non stop shit though its straight to your dome
Don't worry cuz everything is fine
I'm fired up and you done lost your mind

Chorus:
Man:    Mind blowin'...... do do do do do do do
JD:     On and on til the break of dawn 
        See the beats don't stop til the early morn
Man:    Mind blowin'...... do do do do do do do
Brat:   Its like that and as a matter of fact
        When it come to the brat tat tat tat
        I'll make you neck snap back
