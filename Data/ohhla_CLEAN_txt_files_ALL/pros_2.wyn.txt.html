Yessir..
Um, I wouldn't care if you was a prostitute
and hit every man that you ever knew
See it, wouldn't make a difference if that was way before me and you, girl
And you won't never have to worry about me, as long as you keep it real
Whatever's on your mind, speak don't hide your feelings
Stay true for me and never lie to me
and don't you ever keep no secrets, no matter..
Know what I mean.. yeah..
Well if you don't then I'll explain..

Listen
I wouldn't care if you was a prostitute
and hit every man that you ever knew
See it, wouldn't make a difference if that was way before me and you girl
And you won't never have to worry about me, long as you keep it real
Whatever's on your mind, speak don't hide your feelings
Stay true for me and never lie to me
and don't you ever keep no secrets, no matter whatever..
You know what I mean yeah
Well if you don't then I'll explain
You could be Mrs. Wayne
And we could do the damn thang
Had to tell my brother Maine I met a girl like you
And I ain't never met another girl like you
Cause I know what to do with a girl like you, I do

I wouldn't care if you was a prostitute
and hit every man that you ever knew
See it, wouldn't make a difference if that was way before me and you girl
And you won't never have to worry about me, long as you keep it real
Whatever's on your mind, speak don't hide your feelings
Stay true for me and never lie to me
and don't you ever keep no secrets, no matter whatever..
You know what I mean yeah
Well if you don't then I'll explain
See I'd give up the game
At the top of the arena there's a jersey with my name, baby
What's happening baby? What's happening baby?
I know you need to roll with a champion baby
And everytime I see you I get asthma baby
Like *inhales* that's my baby

I wouldn't care if you was a prostitute
and hit every man that you ever knew
See it, wouldn't make a difference if that was way before me and you girl
And you won't never have to worry about me, long as you keep it real
Whatever's on your mind, speak don't hide your feelings
Stay true for me and never lie to me
and don't you ever keep no secrets, no matter whatever..
You know what I mean yeah
Uhh, yeah, uhh, yeah-uh, see cause
I ain't the kind that kiss and tell
But my man say that he really knows you well
But I don't care, I wanna know you for my damn self
Yeah, and even those thugs that say you scandalous
Swinging on the pole from one man to the next
I don't care what he say, no I don't care what he say
Because, they can say what they want baby
But the will never change my views
Cause they would never know you the way that I know you
And I'm trying to share to rest of my whole life with you
And if it gotta be a down, so be it baby
And if your friends can't understand
You don't need 'em baby
You don't need 'em baby
You don't need 'em baby
Don't need 'em
Guitar...

Now lemme hear you say "I love you baby"
Say "I love you baby" [repeat until fade]</pre>
