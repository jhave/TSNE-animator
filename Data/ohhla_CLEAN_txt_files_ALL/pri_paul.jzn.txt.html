[Prince Paul]
Yo whassup? This is Prince Paul
And I've been hearin that this Chief Chinchilla guy
has been runnin around watchin too much Menace II Society
and drinkin all that malt liquor again - yo Chief~!!
That stuff will make sure your future chinchillas will be UN-pimpish
and three headed - listen to your boy J-Zone
And leave them 40's alone
Cause look, you keep on drinkin them 40's
Check it out man, your lips are gonna fall off
Your booty's gonna shrink, and your eyeballs is gonna look like testicles
Trust me, I seen it happen to this kid who lived down the block from me
Now look at him! He's in the Special Olympics
Not because of that - he's actually runnin the concessions stand
See what happens? He got DEMOTED
He used to be, the best rapper in in in in Arkansas
He just fell off!
Fell off like - Insert Rapper Here</pre>
