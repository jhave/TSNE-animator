Album:  Flying Colours
Song:   At Midnight
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Midnight guitar strumming, being one with the moon
Laying down my lyrics, near a lovely lagoon
With a bucket of shrooms, and a staffy to pat
Mans best friend, yeah I'm happy with that
I wanna be happy, I bet that we all do
Ninety percent think they'll never afford to
What a shame what moneys done to the brain
Any country any colour everyone's in it's range
It's like (uh), but I dodge the missiles
So duck down mother fuckers hip-hop's the issue
I will not get played, like hansel and gretel
Do it for the dollar, or dance with the devil
You know why, cause I know how to fight back
And transform this mic. stand into a spike bat
So with a smile on my dial I write raps
And hold down my ground till the empire strikes back
It's me, and I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm the real, I'll be flying with or without a deal
Can't tackle what you can't touch
It won't matter when you can't love
So imagine me at your window singing this song
With twenty eight thousand kids straight up singing along
So through basics eyes, I'll be blessing the beat
With a raw reputation like everly street, (yo) rest in peace

I won't be put down, I won't be shackled
I won't be held back, I won't be tackled
I won't be locked up, I won't be thrown out
Now that I know how to fly
Now that I know how to fly (yo)

I won't be put down, I won't be shackled
I won't be held back, I won't be tackled
I won't be locked up, I won't be thrown out
Now that I know how to fly
Now that I know how to fly

Oh yeah, uh huh, it goes like this check it out, yo

From the seas turn region I roam
On my tree trapeze, through the leaves I have flown
In stained glass skies, the evening unfolds
Stay sharp like a beak of the crow
I just creep on the low, through my secret window
Feel the niche and my mic. plugs a leak in the boat
Never hit the mainstream in the creek where I row
Feel the wind in the willows from the breeze when it
When it's freezing below, when I'm deep in the snow
Opened up my heart, brought heat to the cold
And I, won't follow sheep like a clone in this rat race
They compete for the throne
Treat freedom of speech like a breach of the code
So I unleash and stampede the beat with a flow.(oh lord)
All I want is peace for the globe, yeah were so segregated
It's like each to their own
To my freaks and my peeps that I peep at the show
I'm a keep this brief, can you reach in your soul
Feel free with the seeds of the dreams that you grow
Till they eat what they speak and you reap what you sow
Left this message, like I heard a beep on the phone
(at night on a beach see my teepee aglow
Send smoke signals from the weed that we blow
Hear the bigger picture like what the bleep do we know, you know)

I won't be put down, I won't be shackled
I won't be held back, I won't be tackled
I won't be locked up, I won't be thrown out
Now that I know how to fly
Now that I know how to fly (yo)

I won't be put down, I won't be shackled
I won't be held back, I won't be tackled
I won't be locked up, I won't be thrown out
Now that I know how to fly
Now that I know how to fly

Can every one just put one hand up in the air
This is dedicated to a very close friend of ours just passed away, justin
This is for you
He's watching us right now guys, a very close friend of mine
Meant a lot to me, meant a lot to our music
And so I want you guys to take note
When DJ izm drops this beat, I want you to bob with us

Freaks and my peeps, peep at the show
Keep this brief, reach in your soul [x5]</pre>
