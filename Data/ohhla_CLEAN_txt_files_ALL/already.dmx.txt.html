Grrrrrr
See this is what the fuck we do
I been seein' what y'all do
But it ain't...ahh fuck it!

[DMX]
Cats is runnin' their mouth
Already
'Til they get that gun in their mouth
Already
Now what's all the frontin' about?
Already
Thought I wasn't comin' in that house?
Already
Now they see a whole different crew
Already
Ever since that thing went boom!
Already
Every hood I'm that dude
Already
Ghetto pass stay gettin' renewed
Already
Y'all know how the dog move
Already
I ain't got a damn thing to prove
Already
What's my motherfuckin' name?
Already
It's not a fuckin' game!
Already
COME ON!

[Chorus: DMX]
It's somethin I do
Ain't got nothin to do
With the frontin' you do
With your fuck ass crew
Fuck what you think
Fuck what you say
Cuz I'ma be the dog all day
(Repeat)

[DMX]
Hold up, shit went to the left
Already
Lying with every motherfuckin' breath
Already
Y'all must think niggas is stupid
Already
With that bullshit that you did
Already
Come on we all saw right through that
Already
Try this but don't do that
Already
You can't do this but don't do that
Already
Man that's why I ain't comin' at ya black
Already
This whole rap shit fell apart
Already
Gotta take it back to the start
Already
Kickin' real shit from the heart
Already
Ask y'all that verse to be dark
Already
COME ON!

[Chorus: 2x]

[DMX]
Cats wanna rap but can't write
Already
Niggas is divas that can't fight
Already
Grown men still suckin' dick
Already
Niggas more bitch than a bitch
Already
Wanna be gangsta and a snitch
Already
What part of the game is this!?
Already
Y'all know how I get down
Already
Ring bells when I hit town (ding, ding, ding)
Straight up I lay shit down
Already
What bitch I lay shit now
Already
Dog off the leash again
Already
Ask around in the streets I'ma win
Already
COME ON!

[Chorus: 2x]</pre>
