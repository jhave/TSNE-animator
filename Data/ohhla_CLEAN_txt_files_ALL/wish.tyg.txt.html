Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Well it's that Westside killa bitch, all about my paper
One hand on my guap, screaming finger fuck a hater
2 hands on my lap two bitches ass naked
300 on the drop, and I'm still your bitch favorite
I want her, I get her don't need her
Change them like seasons, fall of when I leave her
Yeah I'm cashing out, and I'm riding with that Nina
Dick game ether, she does speaking no English (Ariba!)
Wilding goin crazy
Yeah, we're in the party and the party getting faded
Already fucked up, I dont know how I made it
And I'mma need a driver, cause the driver intoxicated
A nigga can't tame me, two ladies entertain me
Pull my money out, now the club rainin'
Lemon and Ciroc, now my face changing
Looking like cable, watch 'em standing on the table, and I

[Chorus 2X]
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
We in this bitch, we-we in this bitch

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Two seater, bitch I ain't in a Beetle
Just put 4's on the ghost, but I don't need 'em
Rich game, no shirt, no hole beater
Hotter than the mufuckin devil red Beamer
Wrist gleamer, all about my own demeanor
Said he from the land, but niggas said they never seen ya
Put ice in Adele for no reason
And she catch my balls, like gold keepers
Trippy more, hella bass
Put the bump in your face; why you all up in my space?
Bitch back back, keep my house, cars up to date
Got five hoes with me like I'm on a Elimidate
Nigga don't hate, my money been straight
King gold chains, on the license plate
As I valet the ride
2 chains on, no lie

[Chorus 2X]

[Bridge]
Wilding goin crazy, yeah we in the party and the party gettin faded, faded, faded
Wilding goin crazy, yeah we in the party and the party gettin faded, faded, faded
Wilding goin crazy, yeah we in the party and the bitches gettin faded, faded, faded
Wilding goin crazy, yeah we in the party and these niggas going crazy, man I...

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
