I told ya fuckin' ass I be back 
In a brand new Fleetwood Cadillac
License plate say money makin' nigga fa sho
Chillin' by ya boy house kissin' on these hoes
See these broads want stars
Big dicks down in the drows
Seven days a week seven brand new cars
Yeah I done it parkin' GS 300
Check us and front it the Navigator
Garage with the elevator
You not a hata
Then press second floor
So you can see the muthfuckin' Big Tymers car show
Now on the left side we got the brand new Benz
And on the right side bitches shakin' ass for ends
And in the middle niggas throwin' 20s and 10s
And up top niggas drinkin' juices with gin juices with gin juices with gin

[Baby]
News cars
Pretty broads
Neighborhood superstars
Going far
Goin' to the super bowl
In the hole
And I owe my nigga for frontin' me two kilos
Yellow ice 
With new heights
Hoes got my name right
Fame got my muthafuckin' game tight
Dirt digga
Hoe go-getta
Nigga outta line 
Playboy I got ten on ya feet
Car shinna
Rim blinda
20 inch rida
Nigga and you can ride right beside me
Titty watcha
Hoe stoppa
VCR tape poppa
Neighborhood naked flick watcha
Border line Hen (hennesey) poppa
Byran is my heart and Pearl is my number one chick
And Ca$h Money Records gone run this nationwide shit
And playa you can believe that shit

Chorus: repeat 4X

Whoa whoa whoa Kemosabe
Big big big ballin' is my hobby

[Manny Fresh]
I see you jockin' Baby cuz he got a Mercedes
And ya know about his ladies
And all his babies

[Baby]
I know what they like 
Them brand new bikes
So we can ride around town like Tina and Ike
I'ma shine till I die nigga
We worldwide everybody know Ca$h Money ride or die nigga

[Manny Fresh]
Twenty inch wheels is what I roll
And when I pass yo bitch all outta control

[Baby]
Buyin' Lexus Land Cruisers
The 4-7 the big pipe user
Hoe abuser

[Manny Fresh]
Its the project sticker man
Full of liquor man
Ridin' with cha bitch with the tymers playin'

[Baby]
Ballin everyday popin' Dom P bottles
Ball til ya fall is the Ca$h Money motto
Flashy cars 
Pretty broads
The word uptown we bought these cars
For girls I bought
Pretty jewels 
With new shoes
With tatoos
A Ca$h Money motto do what you gotta do

[Manny Fresh]
Fight who you gotta fight
Shoot who you gotta shoot
Boot who you gotta boot
Do what you gotta do

Chorus

[Manny Fresh]
Ten years ago a friend of mine
Brought me to uptown second line
Met meatball, nair, anglin mets
Want you do a D.J. in the jets
Bought two trigger mans and brown beat
Now you can pop that pussy in the middle of the street
Best believe next week I'ma be downtown
Point court St. Bernard bitch throwin' down
Then I'm mosy on down cross the kanel
Put up the mic cuz I got a fuckin' story ta tell
Teresa 

Baby:	Yous a Ca$h Money bitch say what you still a Ca$h Money bitch
Manny:	I say lil Lisa
