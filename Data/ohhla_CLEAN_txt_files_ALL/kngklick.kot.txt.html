Our klick be the sickest
Your klick act like bitches
Ya'll wanna get some riches
Get with the King klick!

Now everybody stackin' the dough
Everybody with the papers that wants some mo' yea
Everybody thats on the grind, yea serve anybody all day anytime uh
Drive-up teller service right to my back gate
That's the way I ran my game back at 1228
D, B, JR and A what can I say we used to run it nonstop
Sellin' nitrous, acid, extacy, shrooms, pills and a whole lotta pot
Makin' and spendin money
Just laughin and actin' funny
Throwin' parties and pullin' honeys...??

[Daddy X]
They call me X-Tra-X
See im the realest yet
Im like that old school vet, put your whole crew to the test
Ill knock you out your socks, run your ass off the stage
Im pushin major weight, makin plays like Willie Mays
Over the shoulder i get colder as the pressure mounds
Im gettin older so i like my green in large amounts
Im self made never rode on no ones coat or dick
Im gettin paid when you run your mouth about that fuckin' klick

[Chorus (Richter)]
Now we done did this shit
And we still do this shit
Ya'll need to quit your lip
Get with the King klick!

Our klick be the sickest
Your klick act like bitches
Ya'll wanna get some riches
Get with the King klick!

See we got bags of herb
That we'v been known to serve
Ya'll wanna move some? Word!
You know the King klick!

So please dont speak to late
Please do not hesiatate
Yall want that family grave?
You know the King klick!

[D-Loc]

[Richter]
And now we're takin vacations over sea's
Off profits from weed, its me Johnny Richter from the Kottonmouth Kings
Now thats the sickest klick this scene has ever seen
Its also the same klick that be on top of the green
So who's really wanna be down?
Who's down to clown
Who's down for the underground sound
Who's down to rep the krown
Who's down for the city of P-Town
Who's in it to win it, who's in to finish
Who's ready and willin when its time to ?pin it?
Go get that dough that we've been waitin' for come on let's go
Get with the King klick!!

[Chorus (Richter)]
Now we done did this shit
And we still do this shit

Get with the King klick
