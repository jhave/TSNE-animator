[Intro: T.I.] + (Nelly)
Ay, y'all already know what this is homeboy
Nah Mo', no no, no nigga
These niggaz done done it this time
Ay, ay (You like that? OOOOOOOH!)
Fuck what ya heard homeboy! (That feel good to you?)
Real niggaz on deck! (What about now, oooh)
Goons is out nigga! (OOOOH!)

[Nelly]
We doin 100 on the highway switchin lane after lane
If the po-po come in then let 'em, ain't no stoppin today
We brought them horses out tonight (hey!)
Them big locks, duel cams, chrome pips (hey!)
I know you hear 'em
Please, who in yo' hood wouldn't trade places with me
If I ain't what you tryin to be then why you hustlin, see
To be young, black and rich (OOH!)
If that ain't the combination tell me when it switched (OOH!)
I need to know; listen
Maybe the problem is you're thinkin too small
You niggaz only wanna rap and that's all
Yo' only goal is to buy out the mall, I go to buy me a mall
You wanna stunt for the summer, I'm tryin to buy me the fall
And catch a MySpace lick (YEAH!)
You know how many hits MySpace get? (YEAH!)
Hey! Man it's like, I'm hurtin feelings just by tellin the truth
I'm hurtin feelings in and out of this booth; now listen

[Chorus: Nelly] + (T.I.)
You see me sittin in the turnin lane
Yours big but mine bigger mayne
You out here braggin 'bout a little change
You need to step up your game; lil' boy you better
Hold up (ay) hold up (ay) hold up (ay) hold up (ay)
Hold up (ay) hold up  you better sit ya ass down
Hold up (ay) hold up (ay) hold up (ay) hold up (ay)
Hold up (ay) hold up  you better sit ya ass down

[T.I.]
Ay, well 'Pac, I see these haters watchin me
But I ain't trippin when y'all see it ain't no stoppin me
Way in the million and I'm steady buyin property, I got land
Come catch me you hit the lottery, nigga so stop playin
And I ride what I want to, and ya ain't know?
See me buyin what I want to, then walk out the sto'
100 thousand in my pocket, you can tell how I'm walkin
Kick my ball like a dog just to keep these haters off (OHH!)
Posted at the red light, on chrome
Drop-top candy red tight, 454
A nigga want it better bring it on
Fresh off vacation, all that hatin got me paranoid
Yeah, you better know it
What I'm bringin you ain't ready for it, no right now
Once I tell 'em go and get 'em boy, it's lights out
Nigga I ain't playin wit'cha, come any day I'll hit ya
Don't let me pull up on you in that turnin lane nigga

[Chorus]

[LL Cool J]
Hey, hey, hey
My bread stack high like Mike in NBA highlights
Mansion means jacuzzi bubblin with skylights
Uncle L jew-els, killin niggaz eyesight
Wal*Mart stocks since '87 (yeah you damn right!)
My wrist stay glistenin, two birds kissin and
I'm sick of all this money, somebody call a physician in
The American dream, I'm what niggaz is envisionin
You clowns ain't makin it rain, it's just drizzlin (hey!)
Actin like I ain't paid, what you talkin 'bout?
I throw a party at the bank, walk a million out
Got over 30 movies, what you think you doin to me?
You sold a couple records, how you think you gon' outdo me?
You know I'm in shape, I slap you you gon' try to sue me
I buy you off, slide off with your lil' cutie
All this money is a goddamn nuisance
Look at my career, yeah I'm the blueprint (OOH!)
