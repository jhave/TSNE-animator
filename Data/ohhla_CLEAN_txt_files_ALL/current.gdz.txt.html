Gravediggaz..

[Intro: Gatekeeper]
Current events is hell, dwell in the pit of the flames
Walkin the path to maintain
But current events is hell, can you defend to the end
Are you prepared?  Tell me you're scared

[Fruitkwan/Gatekeeper]
Evil that lurks to fiery grave shuns the father
Gatekeep', you're fuckin with the grave robber
Like (?) street sweep, the dungeon storm's comin
Every-fuckin-body starts to runnin
My plague massive rain, a army bridage
Niggaz swingin bats ramshack, organism human remains
Though it's left in a state, of confusion
Powerful eyes of Allah, will see your execution
I hover admist currents, the block field surge
Pressure build, mentally, yo I'm off the clock
Urge to kill, terror to thrill, weaker the will
Blood flows like, lava runnin down the hill
Tons of ash debris, laid waste to rot
Unknown fuse, confiscate one eyes the cyclops
The eyes box, blade cocks, forgive me not
Earthly trait, for niggaz that straight, fire weight
Imagine the blank, screams, the horrible dreams
Wakin up in a sweat, all a sudden forget
Evident of a freeze trees to spleen
With or whenever green multi shit contract
And how we adapt, sword, so yet the wicked stay warned
You motherfuckers is on

[Chorus: Gatekeeper]
Current events is hell, dwell in the pit of the flames
Walkin the path to maintain
But current events is hell, can you defend to the end
Are you prepared?  Tell me you're scared
Current events is hell, dwell in the pit of the flames
Walkin the path to maintain
Current events is hell, can you defend, down to the end
Are you prepared for fear?

[Too Poetic/Grym Reaper]
Yo..
Up from the bottomless pit, of the rottenest shit
With a hit for the streets, Grym Reap', Gatekeep'
Grym will assault all the herbs on the asphault
Cash rules cats that steal shit, and blast false
Get the paper, crooked politicians can't save ya
as a Gravedigga, we play a major
part in the crisis; didja know Christ is me?
Reincarnated in a MC
I came to the hookers, pimps and the killers
The thievin ass niggaz, my soldiers, guerillas
Nine to five cats and drug dealers with gats
I'm P-R-O black but y'all already know that
Fuck a horrorcore, I bring holy war
Cold and raw as it bubble and ya moan through your pores
My soul soars, way above Armageddeonites
Fuel the battlefield through the hot metal and ICE!
Bling bling niggaz better come out to fight
when the pigs keep robbin the hood of black life
How many of you trife cats go runnin to church
while guns is hummin puttin, blacks in the hearse
Everytime I talk about peace cats frown
If it ain't about cream most teams ain't down
As the supreme brown King and the Queen frown
I'ma be a hater, to all race traitors!

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
