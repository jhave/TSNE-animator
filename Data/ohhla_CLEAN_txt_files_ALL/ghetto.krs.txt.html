[KRS-One]
Feel this!  Feel it!
Feel the power, of DJ Kenny Parker, word up.. huh!

C'mon, yeah.. uhh.. {"Yeah yeah yeah"}
So we gonna come down one time for your mind, you know whassup
Turn it up, turn it up turn it up turn it up
Look!!

We spit out hits, ghetto chicks, chromed out whips
Philosophers rockin your corner movie scripts
Ghetto lifestyles, keep watchin..
{"Protect yourself"} - that's right!
We spit out hits, ghetto chicks, chromed out whips
Philosophers rockin your corner movie scripts
Ghetto lifestyles, keep watchin..
{"Protect yourself"}

Yo, all summer they bump the KRS-Oner
From the microscopic atomic structure of the under
I spit thunder, which hunts ya, runs you down and stuns ya
I'm at the center of all rap worlds like a rotunda
Then again, I rock you and your friend again
In any club in the country when you say KRS they say, "Let him in"
V.I.P. passes for intellectuals with glasses
Ignorant asses get left outside with the masses
Next day we attend classes and gatherings
Shattering, those that be rattling about battling
Battin 'em down from the Bronx like Don Mattingly(?)
The black African snappin backs again and laughin again
You won't be askin again, my album I'm already masterin
Whoever you think is dope I'm already blastin him

We spit out hits, ghetto chicks, chromed out whips
Philosophers rockin your corner movie scripts
Ghetto lifestyles, keep watchin..
{"Protect yourself"} - that's right!
We spit out hits, ghetto chicks, chromed out whips
Philosophers rockin your corner movie scripts
Ghetto lifestyles, keep watchin..</pre>
