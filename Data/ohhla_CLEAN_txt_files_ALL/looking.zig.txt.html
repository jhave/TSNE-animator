Typed by: AZ Lyrics

My frustration won't subside I've been tried time after time
But it's not my style to quit there is more to life than this
In obscurity or fame we're all playing in this game
Searching for something searching for something

Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine

Saturday in the morning and the rain kept falling
Brother didn't get no sleep now he's really feeling beat
But there is no time to waste as the devil test his faith
He just walks away on a mission to complete

Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine
Looking oh find you will be fine

She has her hand on her jaw as she wonders away
What will tomorrow bring will her dreams just disappear
She find words are hard to say so she prays everyday
She must find a way may the pieces fall into place

Frustration won't subside I've been tried time after time
But it's not my style to quit there is more to life than this
In obscurity or fame we're all playing in this game
Searching for something searching for something

Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine
Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine
Searching for something, looking for something</pre>
