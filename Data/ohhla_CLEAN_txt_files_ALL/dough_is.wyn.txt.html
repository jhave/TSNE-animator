Typed by: Rayslim500@yahoo.com

[Chorus]
Dough is what I got, lil mama
Dough is what I got, pretty lady
Dough is what I got, shortie
Dough is what I got, baby
c'mon, I'm paid {*4X*}

[Lil Wayne]
Give a woman none, uh-huh
I already gave my brother some, it's my sister turn
Ain't it funny how the fish do burn
But your boy just relax like a fresh new perm
Like the World in the barrel of the pistol turn
Homie get it how we live, never live and learn
Gotta talk about the flow cause you is concerned
Only down south rapper could've been in The Firm
Or the Commission or Wu-Tang nigga
Tryna tell you I can kick it like Liu Kang nigga
Got that Sub-Zero flow, how you want me ma'?
Make her get over here like Scorpion
And when it comes down to the recording
I must be Lebron James if he's Jordan
No, I won rings for my performance
I'm more Kobe Bryant of an artist
Same coach, same game, been starting
... Same tri-angle Offense
I come through the lane like Dargent
Referee niggas is lame, they call charging
I have no brain I'm retarded
We are not the same I'ma Martian
You can be my Jane, I'm your Tarzan
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison
I am magnificent like Marcus
You might wanna fall back like August
Or late september whatever you call it
I hit niggaz in the head like Vonage
I am talking to no particular audience
But understand I'm the guardian
And understand there won't be no guardin him
You will just get played like an accordion
I don't give a damn if she's bossy
I keep pussy running like a faucet
She better catch like she Steve Largent
Because I'm "What's up" like "Martin"

[Lil Wayne]
See I know y'all be talking about and you don't like what you here sometimes
but um um since I'm so bright I'ma put the spotlight on you baby

[Chorus]
Show me what you 'bout, lil daddy
I know you need to stop, stop hatin
I know what you not, wodie
And that is Weezy Baby
Blunts up now
Blaze {*4X*}

[Lil Wayne]
Tell the world take six
Young dictionary make words make sense
Then, I make cents, make dollars
Make the skinny girl holla
Make the fat girl hungry
Make the ugly girls want me
But the pretty girls on me
Make the shy girls horny
Make the fly girls corny
And only for me because of who I A.M. (who I am)
Holla back in the morning
Now holla back if you on see
The CEO of the moment
Bullshit I don't condone it
Aw baby just hop on it

[Chorus]
Show me what you got, lil mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shortie
Show me what you, baby
You rappers ain't
