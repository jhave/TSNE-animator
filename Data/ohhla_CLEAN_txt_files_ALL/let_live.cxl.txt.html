[Chino XL]
Yo, yo
Remember me? Chino like the prison
I jism religion on niggas that think I'm bullshittin
Considering my position my opposition
Gave me lots of vision
In pots I'm pissing
Still niggas try to make me missing
I christen the dead
Run with killers that sick in the head
Unless you missing what's said
Start nailing and pissing in bed
I pistol the Feds
Slap cop top notch
The only thing you'll outline in chalk's a game of hopscotch what

[Kool G. Rap]
I spit my shit like a flame thrower
The frame blower
King with the brain exploder
Inside the Range Rover
Load the six-stain holder
Lay you and your dame over
Banging your main soldier
'Till my aim strain my shoulder
My rap game solar
The platinum chain polar
You flip a chain cobra
I'm a hit your Vien Motor
One hundred and twenty five grange we arrange the rover
Nigga trade ya rover for the redrum stains you sober

(Chorus: Kool G. Rap
                  [Chino XL])

We could've came from out the bushes layed you flat where you live but...
[We allowed you cowards to live]
Word up,
We could've ran up in your house and put the gun to your kids but...
[We allowed you cowards to live]
Seen you walking out the bank and stick the gat to your ribs
[We allowed you cowards to live]
Yeah, we could've gripped rubber grip handled and handled our biz but...
[We allowed you cowards to live]
We allowed you cowards to live!

[Kool G. Rap]
Yo, don't fight the heist if you treasure your life
Cus my trife is measured in nights
Out your wife at the edge of my knife
And it'll be my pleasure to slice
The bitch will be forever with Christ
Get hit twice with this real nice
Berretta device
Nickel playes to your North Face
Put feathers and flight
Let my lead strike and sever your life
Leaving you red and wet in the night
Head bite from infrared sight
Cock back, squeeze and let it ignite
Placing your body where the bedbugs bite
Baby you thug right?
A slug might, open your mug like
I'm checking your blood type
The drug life
We hop on a Rolls
Shopping for clothes
Rocking our foes
Put you in a coffin with the top of it closed
You know, put a fucking glock to your nose
Run up in your spot for the O's and blow
Shove cock in your hoe
You 'bout to blow
Nothing stopping the doe
Most popular flow
Like iceberg at the top of the globe

(Chorus: Chino XL
                [Kool G. Rap])

I ain't made a record in three years and that's why you rich
[We allowed you cowards to live]
Yo, I could've kidnapped your babies left ransom notes on their beds but I...
[We allowed you cowards to live]
Yo, you'd be holding your breath forever tongue kissing your fist cus we...
[We allowed you cowards to live]
Yo, It's Kool G. Rap, Chino XL son you know who this is...
[We allowed you cowards to live]
We allowed you cowards to live

[Chino XL]
Yo, I feel like the future literally
Cus it's never been proven if any man alive is capable of seeing me
I'm he that walks the earth in infamy
XL shitting on niggaz like Kool G. Rap did all the cats in the First Symphony
That's all you'll get from me
Do all it separately cus the best MC's
Always float to the top unlike the son of John F. Kennedy
Chi forever be on Jersey live shit
Battle? You won't survive it
Tommy Motolla wish he could trade lives with
I'm weak? How you figure yo? Blow Deniro like oregano
Da da da da da! Watch me change to super-nigga-ro!
I'm innovational, mind unobtainable
Merciful vocal verbal versatile
Killing these niggas recreational
Universally disperse the curse verse controversial
Illest on earth so
Out of this world like captain Kirk's hoe
Get Patty Hearst doe
Commit you to the dirt slow
Even worse thou
High yellow Chino leave you needing what a nurse know
Cipher with me, you getting hurt yo
Friend or foe
Catch a L in the circle like a fucking Lexus logo

[Kool G. Rap]
We could've ran up in your house and put the gun to your kids but...
[We allowed you cowards to live]

[Chino XL]
You be holding your breath forever tongue kissing the fish but...
[We allowed you cowards to live]

[Kool G. Rap]
Yeah, we could've flipped the rubber grip handles and handled our biz but...
[We allowed you cowards to live]

[Chino XL]
Yo, It's Kool G. Rap and Chino XL son you know who this is...
[We allowed you cowards to live]

[Chino XL]
Knock em out the box Chi, knock em out Chi
Let em live son
Knock em out the box Chi, knock em out Chi
Let em live son
Knock em out the box Chi, knock em out Chi
Knock em out the box Chi, knock em out Chi
Knock em out the box, knock em out yo
Let em live son
Cowards live...
Ha ha
We allowed these cowards to live</pre>
