[Asher Roth]
Yeah, uhh, yeah!
Use the eyes of the owl, there's a sour batch
The sour patch kids got me out of wack
And out of gas, the hourglass
spills as I left on the vast sea without a vest
Lost my train of thought, my brain cannot be bought
Trained to train and co-operate with authorit-ay
No way José  the Che in May
Revolutionary - to the leaders I'm scary
I pose a threat to those who get too close for comfort
And won't conform
Come forward, sworn on my unborn son
If there's one more war I will come forth
The  poor get poor, the rich just get richer
Get the chips, you see the big picture?
Shine a stitch from a shake on the Richter
Mother Earth shrugs and we all get evicted
This some sick shit, slightly twisted
Information from our nation's capital
Capitol is all the captain calls, for
They just want more (and more)
And more (and more) and more (and more?)
And more (and more) and more (and more!)
I don't hear you

[Chorus]
Take me away...
Take me away from here
Take me away from evil
I don't hear you

[Interlude]
Can you turn it up just a little bit?
Can you turn it up just a little bit?
Can you turn it up just a little bit?
Can you turn it up? Can you turn it up?

[Asher Roth]
Yeah, yeah
My people cryin and be dyin, they be dining in the islands
Drinking wine with they wives like everything is fine
Denying that they fighting for the lives every night
to survive since the beginning of time
I-yi-yi, can't believe the evil that feeds
off this so-called American dream
Lies and deceit make all the Americans seem
like blood-suckin money hungry fiends
But money doesn't mean, a damn thing to me
I just want to be, I want to be free
But unfortunately a fortune is what you need
Cause the Fortune 500's run the country
It's one, company if you're not in company
Would you mind grabbin me a cup of tea?
If we go hung-r-y in our own count-r-y
I wonder what it's like, living in Hungary
Yeah it isn't funny but it's coming, it's about to get ugly
Streets turn to a game of rugby (y'all don't hear me though)

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Asher Roth]
Yeah! We're buying bubbly and make it rain 100's
Is it just me or is that some dumb shit?
Yo what the fuck, ho-hum, through with dumb shit
Let's go  I know you can think of something
Donate your dollars, raise a toddler, help a mother, save a father
Cause poverty is probably our biggest problem
And it ain't gon' stop with Obama (nah)
To save the world we must start at the bottom (got it)
Bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom
Bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom... {*echoes*}

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I don't hear you.. {*4X*}
Yeah, yeah
Wooooooooooooooooo
Yeah... yeah
I don't hear you {*distorted echoes fade out*}</pre>
