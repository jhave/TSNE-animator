[Verse 1]
I never call her a dime, just outta respect
She's more like the priceless coins people collect
It's hurts to think back -- and I don't talk too much about love
but I'ma tell exactly how I feel
I agreed but never knew that pain was part of the deal
The scars to my heart are the type to never heal
Chewed and spit me out like I was part of the meal
It's probably cuz I acted like I can't feel
But I could, and it felt so good when I would
Never thought I'd fall in love with a chicken from the hood
She spoke like the sage, wise from experience and age
and taught me how to channel my rage
Said life is a book and every page is a stage
Never go by face value cuz the message is vague
Whipped like a slave, your love is all the rave
Ways so blazed, givin a praise to the shade
Man, we laid together - prayed together
I guess you forgot the empire we made together
It was small but had structure like a stone pillar
Then ya left an aftermath like the wrath of Godzilla
At least ya didn't want me for my scrilla
Cuz I was a beginner - if you stayed the pay-off woulda been iller
Woulda built you a mansion and a beach by the villa
Want a killa? Played the game similar to Reggie Miller
I thought I had it won 'til ya dropped the bomb
Took my jewels and basically pawned my leg and my arm
It ain't long... after the storm is the calm...

[Chorus]
Tell me why'd you treat this way...
Tell me why'd you treat this way...
     I don't usually talk about love (about love)
     about love (about love) -- but I'ma tell you how I feel
Tell me why'd you treat this way...
Tell me why'd you treat this way...
     I don't usually talk about love (about love)
     about love (about love) -- but I'ma tell you how I feel

[Verse 2]
In the calm I like to slink back, and try to think back
about all the things you said and did you really think that?
Our love was a chain, and couldn't build them links back
That shit'll make a nigga wanna take his minks back
I put you above me lovely, and it's hard to admit
But still I think I found my soulmate
I gave you warm love, instead you showed me cold hate
Hopin ya soul accompanies mine to the Gold Gate
Remember when we scraped on the Handy-Cam 8
Skipped the silver screen, went straight to video tape
I thought this was a private affair, census
Come home to find my crib lookin like a cineplex
What all these people doin here? Ain't even my crew in here
Bitch explain it, I ain't got nuttin but time
Probably blinded by the shine while you was caught in the lime
Plus I got a couple question that keep plaguing my mind
If you don't love me, then leave me alone
Your treatin me wrong, even peep on the phone deceit in ya tone
Deep and alone, keep offendin my pride
Never think ya have a feminine side until it arise
You hardcore but I think you still deserve more
Findin ya body in pages up in the porn store
What a surprise, what a demise (oooohh!!)
Lettin niggaz butter ya thighs and nut in ya eyes
Had a body chiseled like a statue
Now ya titties sag, nigga can't believe that that's you
It ain't natural, got rolls like them underground moles
Feet belong to trolls, can't fuck with Dr. Scholls
You used to have goals, you I woulda died for
Stayed up endless nights and even cried for
I tried hard but maybe I shoulda tried more
But if I gave you my trust you woulda lied more
Cuz I know it coulda worked out like Tae-Bo
Instead of plummet face down into a spi-ral
Playin with fire like a pyro -- sometimes I think
it was the best thing that happened to me; now I know
Word around, ya had a crib and burnt it down
That's right, gettin careless with the crackpipe
Got on drugs, withered away slowly but sure
Caught the package but you fumbled the cure
I'm asking why you cuz I admired you
I cried when you died but when you died I died too
And it's fine though...

[Chorus]
Tell me why'd you treat this way...
Tell me why'd you treat this way...
     I don't usually talk about love (about love)
     about love (about love) -- but I'ma tell you how I feel
Tell me why'd you treat this way...
Tell me why'd you treat this way...
     I don't usually talk about love (about love)
     about love (about love) -- but I'ma tell you how I feel
....
