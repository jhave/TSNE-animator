Stay away from me - 4x

[Trae]
Guerilla Maab, coming up out the gates
It'd be best, to go and get out the way
Running around, with a K and don't play
All about Dougie D, Z-Ro and Trae
See we don't know, what the fuck you say
If I get agg'd, better move around cause I'm gonna spray
Starting from my own letter zone
Not too many people can relate
Didn't wanna say that I'm wrong
Cause I'm walking around, with a frown on my face
I know, you wanna hate me
But if you don't know, you better reach back to G

[Hook - 2x]
Stay away from me
You niggaz, oughtta know
Stay away from me
My pain, won't let me go
Stay away from me
It feels, like I'm going insane
Stay away from me
The streets, keep calling on me

[Trae]
I might as well recommend, you leave me the fuck alone
Before I get pissed off in the zone, running with chrome
Guerilla Maab niggaz, forever riding alone
Three deep off party, we ready to bring it on
We done been through too much, you niggaz done fucked up
The pain that's beside of me, is getting me pumped up
While some of you lucked up, and brought the pack back
But now we back kicking your ass, now how you like that
Z-Ro, Trae, Dougie D we number one
And on my life there ain't no fucking with me, nigga here we come
Leaving em stunned, verbally dropping another bomb
Till a the nigga get numb, you better get up and run
We ain't having it, platinum plack nigga we grabbing it
And stacking it, plack for plack keeping the billboards tracking it
The wildest microphones and nigga get the fuck on, you way outta your zone
We ahead of your league, ahead of your time
Or repping the release, my pain my reason for rhyme
And when a nigga fucking with mine, I flatten they line
I think you better get outta town, or real with mine
And I ain't fin to be laying it down, Guerilla Maab collide
Or fuck around with the Maab, and I bet that they'd never find you
Got em hanging they brains, to stay ready to slide you
Bitch ass niggaz, lace up and I'ma glide you

[Hook - 2x]

[Dougie D]
Now can you feel my pain
The way that we struggle, hustle grinding against the grain
Living a life oh, getting nothing but change
If it's pertaining to money, I gotta go get it mayn
Cause me and my niggaz, be getting down for these
And fucking with one of us, bitch you bound to bleed
Dougie D, Z-Ro, Trae M double A-B
Your best bet is, to stay away from me
I got no time, to be fucking around with you marks
Ain't got no time, to be fucking around with you punks
Ain't got no time, to be fucking around with you niggaz that be in the water
Looking up at us like a shark, and that one of us
Ain't running we are, motherfucker we Maab type Texas tough
Rough and stuff, don't fuck with us befo'
We bust the art of war, beams armed and dangerous
And it's a must, the K's and nines we bust
Putting niggaz in choke holds, throwing bows
Fuck boys up on sight, ready tomorrow
Stuff em in funnels, like some damn burritos
Cause all niggaz that's loud, been scared get disposed
I done told you once, and that's that
Stay away from me, 'fore your wig get smashed
Your mama know you son of a bitches, that's digging ditches
Stay away from me while I'm making my riches, what now (what now)

[Hook - 2x]

Stay away from me - 4x

You niggaz, oughtta know
My pain, won't let me go
It feels, like I'm going insane
The streets, keep calling on me - 2x</pre>
