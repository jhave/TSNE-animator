[Dr. Dooom]
Yeah! Doc
Late nights

I'm Dr. Dooom on the moonlight
Cut your fuckin head in Night Flight, the cravin for the crocodile
Snap at the legs on your bike
I'm under the dim lights, standin like Norman Bates
Recordin the facts on normal tapes
Cut off pieces of your feet one by one now you got the blood on your Bapes
I see you step in the ambulance with the shakes
Piss on your front disc brakes
Box you out like a linebacker, you miss the fakes
The complimentary drinks you taste
The weights weigh one thousand, I drop 'em on your face {OH!}
Watch your teeth and brace
Now you ass out, a guy on the mic with peace lace
I do this when I step to each place
With the hand that grips on the pliers you admire

[Chorus]
All hands you throw up, get chopped up
Janitors come out with detergent buckets
(Workin overtime) you get mopped up

[Dr. Dooom]
First thing you gon' do as a journalist
is compare this to the first Dr. Dooom
Fuck you~! I come and find you
and slice your kneecaps into coldcuts in the room
You criticize these raps so advertisers and watch me pour some gas on your face
And set your hair on fire
Move your nose off your body with hammers and workman tires
Texas Chainsaw Massacre liars
Punch you in the face like Aaron Pryor
Go up to the hardware store and grab some donuts for the flow
Donuts for the go
Muscle shirt that say "keep up the good work"

[Chorus] - repeat 1.66X

[Dr. Dooom]
Shove your head in a Macy's bag, with the Macy's tag
Go head I drop birds on the shoulders
You feel the pigeon release shit on top of your head when I brag
That's the skull head in the front window of the Jag
I'm edgy, givin the competition a wedgie
Lizard and croc for lunch
Cruise 400 miles, just to get my hands on some peanut brunch
Brittle! I chop between two eyes, bullseye, right up the middle
Let's get down to the griddle
The fats move, dance around and fly around my face while I play the fiddle

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
