Artist: Akinyele 
Album:  Vagina Diner 
Song:   Dear Diary 
Typed by: scott_rodkey@hotmail.com

My vocals sound dynamic when placed on track 
Me wack? Your local mechanic couldn't even fix his mouth to say that 
I'll make a rapper change his occupation 
And have him selling hot dogs if he ain't saying nathan' 
I wait for challengers to pick a day to beef 
I'm not a calendar- 
I'll knock your ass to the middle of next week (next week) 
Leaving you OUTDATED, I'm R-RATED 
Niggas on my dick was to fall off if I was to get CASTRATED 
No need to explain 
I'm doper than heroin, so just take my name in vain 
You can't follow the Ak's footmarks 
I'll throw your raps in a shoebox and let the bullshit WALK! 
I straighten up those who be slacking up 
In other words I'm not a film director 
So don't come over here acting up 
You know just who I AM 
This ain't the DAMN Macho MAN Wrestling PROGRAM 
Over here you get SLAMMED on the premises 
Remeber this, the name Akenyele it don't rhyme with Genesis 
I'm not the one to get played 
This ain't the arcade 
Pull over here and you'll find your fingers in the yellow page 
You can't hang with the kid 
My lrics are so bad they're only taught in school 600 
So all you rappers keep eyeing me 
But just admire me 
And write this shit in your diary 

Dear, dear diary (I kicked it plain and simple) 
Write it in your book, kid 
Dear, dear diary (I kicked it plain and simple) 
Put it on your pages 
Dear, dear diary (I kicked it plain and simple) 
Write it in your book, kid 
Dear, dear diary...check it out 

Yo Rob Swift! (Rob Swift gets business) x4 

All you got to do is just set it 
Better yet act like you want it and see if you don't get it 
I walk over rappers like doormats 
Save all that Nino Brown chat for all them other New Jacks 
In your CITY, with your whole damn COMMITTEE 
Your butt-ass rhymes are all SHITTY 
So don't riff cause I'm in a class by myself 
Make like a ventriloquist, talk that shit someplace else 
Lyrics you pick are all simple 
And all like swift to come out your face like a dam pimple 
But just so you can't follow this 
My rhymes penetrate to the skin just like a dermatologist 
Best to head to the CLINIC 
Cause Akenyele's style about to spread like an EPIDEMIC 
I don't talk past the speed LIMIT 
One style's a GIMMICK 
I won't change up because I'm not a SCHIZOPHRENIC 
Pushing a wooden box 
6 foot 6 is what you catch if you step to the Ak 
I kill a rapper's better one sec 
If he ever play me like an accident and think he can catch wreck 
Shit (sheee...) 
Once I COMBINE ya, here's another REMINDER 
Niggas can get stomped down to CHINA 
In other words get that ass kicked 
I'll send your wack baby-ass raps right back to pediactrics 
Play the back before you get smacked 
Ask like a Lumberjack, I come from the projects of Lefrack 
AK to the NEL 
Don't give a HELL who you wanna TELL 
Not an intercom but my name rings BELLS 
So all you rappers c'mon, if you want to start trying me 
But write this shit in your diary </pre>
