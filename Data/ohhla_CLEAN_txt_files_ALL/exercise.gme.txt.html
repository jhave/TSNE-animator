[Chorus]
dis a lyrical excersise, it go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
jus a lyrical excersise, it go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
jus a lyrical excersise, it go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
jus a lyrical excersise, it go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

[Verse 1]
I'ma flip right on the block
till I get life in the box
or till I get ice from a shot
but till den, itz chill jims
Ice and a watch
and yes nigga, we the bess nigga
like it or not
cuz ya'll be writin dead weight
like you got a red cape
when the 8 blast, ya fake xxx be scared straight
I'll rush on ya set, then cut you to death
get it right, knife stuck in ya neck
man you got two options cut me a check, or
stuff on the vest before you get bucked in the chest
I squeeze till nuffin is left
You'll get banged in the head wit revolvers like russian roulette
ya'll doin a lotta talkin, I'm tired of talkin
ya bout to hear tires screeching and iron sparkin
when the heata pop look who totin a sig
and it'll open ya lid like a sneaker box
If I creep you ock, I'ma spray ya way
In all black, like agent jay look this pay me day
I need dat, get ya spleen clapped
I'll make you bleed where you breathe at

[Chorus]
dis a lyrical excersise, it go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
dis a lyrical excersise, it go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
dis a lyrical excersise, it go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

[Verse 2]

they ain't teachin in class
It started from wit an ounce in a house
I was runnin shop
make sure they had it in
and make sure they come an' cop
I'm wanted ock

when I'm the 1
with the gun
with the cyclops eye
bet suttn ock
If you bet nuttn pop

b strapped, and catch suttn hot
I'm dat wise, that's why I wear the mask
F-Y-I, I'm too deep to get compared to Cass

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If ya homie don't come wit half ma cheese

For the chips I got chicks to come bag ma weed
