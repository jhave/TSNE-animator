[Intro]
Imma Make Your Legs Shake
Tonight'll be different from any other night
Imma Make Your Leg Imma
Imma Make Your Legs Shake
Tonight I wanna hear you screamin' ooohhh
Leg Shake
(yeeaahh)
Imma Make Your Legs Shake
And I'm gonna give you the reasons why
Imma Make Your Leg Imma
Ooooooo
Imma Make Your Legs Shake
Baby baby baby baby

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down down down
And do it 'til your legs' shakin'
Do it 'til your legs' shakin'
Do it 'til your leg
I'm going down down down
And Do it 'til your legs' shakin'
Do it 'til your legs' shakin'
Do it 'til your leg
Ooohhh

[Verse 1]
Dead in the middle of the club
I spotted at her
Shorty's so tough
I think I'm in love
Imagination goin' crazy
Think I wanna make her my lady
And the way that she get so freaky
I just wanna give her a baby
And then I'm gonna get her wide open
Give her what she been missin' and feelin'
Lick it 'til she's shiverin' oooh
And then I'm gonna look her in her eyes and tell her
I love herâ¦

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing gonna interrupt this mood we're in
They can call all they want they can knock all they want
But they won't get in No
Not tonight
Cause I'm about to make my mark on you girl
You are my world
My piece of paradise
If you let me do
Let me do
What I want to you
Girl I promise through this whole night I'll be kissin' you
Until your body cums
Until we see the sun
Send you into to shock girl once I touch you with my Taser tongue
And then I just wanna get her wide open
Give her what she been missin' and feelin'
Lick it 'til she's shiverin' oooh
And then I'm gonna look her in her eyes and tell her
I love herâ¦

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Ludacris]
Luda
Ha ha
Wait for it wait for it
Let me tell you what I'mma do right quick
(Whatchu gon' do)
Listen
Imma start from the
Forehead to lips to the neck to the chest
Flip her over then I'm kissin' down her backside
Flip her over again I'm ready to go for a swim
Imma make her body tremble if she act right
Make her as woozy as woozy get
Feelin' like we on a movie set
Can you feel the vibrations?
My tongue just like a Jacuzzi jet
I put your man to shame wit it
I don't play no games wit it
Imma have you grippin' the seats screamin'
When I write your name wit it
First last middle
And my tongue just likes to scribble
Morning, noon, and night
I gotta have it
I'm a dog eat it up like bits and kibbles
Make me dribble like cp3
But I rep that DTP
So if you gimme that
I'ma give you that
One leg up over my shoulder
Let me be your remote controller
Let me try to keep my composure
So many different ways that I can fold ya
Oh yea I go to town Girl
You should keep me around (oohhh)
Cause every night I'm goin'

[Chorus]
I'm going down down down (baby)
And do it 'til your legs' shakin'
Do it 'til your legs' shakin'
Do it 'til your leg
(Oh)
I'm going down down down
And do it 'til your legs' shakin' (Oh baby ya)
Do it 'til your legs' shakin'
Do it 'til your leg
Then I'm gonna make her shakeâ¦
(Uh yea)
I'm gonna make you shake girl
(Your legs' shakin' baby)
(All night)
Open up and shake it baby
Shakin' Girl

[Outro]
So uh
Whatchu think about that?
Yea I thought you would
No I like it to it's cool</pre>
