Intro: Pretty Boy (Foxy) 
(That's right) 
(And it's on) 
Ayo Fox check this out yo 
(That's right) 
I been hearin all these bitches talkin this bullshit 
You know they done fucked up now 
You know they done fucked up now

[Verse 1: Foxy]
You wanna be this bitch
Have a nigga like Jigga and cop the 6
BK where the bitches be
Fuckin for kicks
And at the eve of Fox record be
Gettin the pussy licked
On some hustle type shit
I'm sayin
If this rap shit flop
I'll sling the pussy like 
Screw this rap shit
And you mad rapper bitches
Cuz I'm half yo age
Spit like 8 bars on some shit
That'll double ya pay
Ya'll confused ass chicks
Now is you straight 
Or is you gay
Now that's ya business
You like pussy 
Ain't no more to say
That's some bullshit
Na Na gone get mo sick
When my dogs ship harder
And talk mo shit
Debut at number one
Never second to shit
Ya'll know I'm bout that doe
I ain't stressin that shit
Went double platinum on ya'll bitches
On some R&amp;B shit
Now got to flip on ya'll hoes
Take it back to this thug shit

[Interlude: Pretty Boy]
Yea Fox
Now that's the shit I'm talkin about
That's the shit I'm talkin about
That's that Brooklyn shit

[Verse 2: Foxy]
I can't call it
But this rap shit
Got me bout to get spastic
And spase out
Straight like that
My flows attract riches
Ya'll just gettin ice bitches
Been doin this for years
And just gettin nice bitches
Each ya'll got the nerve to cop a Land in '98
When I see ya'll got a Nav to great ya'll
It's a leason I'ma teach ya'll
Fox'll eat ya'll
Been doin this Tito shit
Since Ain't No Nigga hit ya'll
60 weeks on the chart 
To do what my first week sold
And I know my shit
You ain't platinum you're white gold
Watch ya whole shit flake up
Ya'll going broke hoes
Need to switch up
Stack the cake up
But fuck wit Jacob

[Interlude: Pretty Boy]
Hold on
If ya'll don't know who Jacob is
That's that cat in the Diamond District
That sell Fox all her rollies
Hold on hold on
Yo Fox tell them what's goin down Fox
Tell them 

[Verse 3: Foxy]
It's about to go down
For the showdown
You real on it
Can you but a half a mil
And ya deal on it?
Niggas keep yappin that lame shit
And I'm snatchin erything you claim
Plus erything I came in
It's the set off
Put ya bet off
Switchin and sayin in '98
With the shit that I'm bringin
Face off
Bring the safes I'm about to blaze one
Like me BK dogs
Oh Tre ones

But if you wanna take it like that
