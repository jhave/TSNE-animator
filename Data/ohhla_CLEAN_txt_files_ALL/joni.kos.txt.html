Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Ron Burgundy]
"I look good
I mean really good
Hey everyone, come and see how good I look!"

[K-OS]
We gotta bring back the clock
Kit that out there
Hit that old school lyrics yo
Ha ha
Yo

Positive vs negative causes electrical charge
Like it at the bar like it I'm a lover at large
En garden
Begging your pardon
Harden, scorchin'
Always ringing the bells
I never barge in
I'm easy
Greasy rockin' chicks
Keep me dizzy
I'm busy with socks with tizzy
We hail from T-drizzy
It's K, Canada
I'm manager
I'm amateur
Damage your RAM
With my planet's sublaminal stamina
Go red to black
Respect
Rock it I'm getting down
Rocking the cold sound
Joni Mitchell and peeling out
Break it down
I'm wit it
I admit it
I going to get it
I'm about to hit it
Ask if I did it
Rise the depths
Hit the steps
Took away my breath
Quiet as kept
Please respect the architect
When I blast
I'm nasty
I'm down so fasty
And with my marijuana
Homie's so everlasting

[Chorus]
All alone
Floating out here
me and the microphone
In the atmosphere
Who's on the throne
And are you the coming down here?
G O D help us please

S O S
S O S
S O S

[Saukrates]
Yeah, hope you got your choir focals on
I'm in every four corners of the globe alone
Mile hight, like stockton
And home alone
Me and kevin connect
We win like Oprah's on
Yeah
I don't mean to provoke your calm
You a hater now
Cuz I wrote this song
The rope is on you now
I'm searching for redemption
I'm running through the Shawshank with a hopeful poem
Hands full of em
Back the earth
Cats we keep peeling em
To run away no joke man
Its my fault your heart
Crush like a coke can
Hah, I should have been there for ya
But I'm with the satellites
So, talk to my lawyer
Yeah, I swear it would be different
I thought we could be the best of friend
In the end
I mean

[Chorus]
All alone
Floating out here
me and the microphone
In the atmosphere
Who's on the throne
And are you the coming down here?
G O D help us please</pre>
