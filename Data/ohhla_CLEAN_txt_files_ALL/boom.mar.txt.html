[Verse - Juvenile]
Juvenile and Mario pimping and we on deck
So stay tune to ya programs cause we on next
I wanna see the women catching the wall
Unless she got that disease, no ass at all
For the hood, for the club, videos or whatever
I got that oldschool, the Bentley or the Porsche Carerra
Profiling with the top off
Wilding, looking for a dime piece I can knock off

[Verse - Mario]
Up in the spot sipping on a little something
Feeling like this joint's is bout to pop off
Looking around trying to spot a little something
Trying to see what somebody talking bout
And if it's good I'm a lend my ear
To a little bit of game all up in my ear
I think I found a window over here
Homegirl is all up in my face like (boom)
Oh yes indeed, all we needed is a hell of a beat like (boom)
And we gon to jam cause I'm feeling like a Yeah! tonight

[Chorus - Mario]
Hold up it's like (boom!)
That's that beat we like
Bet it make the party jump off (boom!)
DJ spin that twice, we about to tear this club up! (boom!)
Ladies you gotta move something (boom!)
Cause the fellas wanna see ya shake something like (boom!)
We got the party getting crunk!
If you don't give a damn, gon throw it up!

[Verse - Mario]
No more siting on the wall little shorty
Starting to feel like a stone cold party
Don't act like you can't sit wit me
Everybody in the club getting tipsy
Ain't this beat on fire, DJ spin it back one more time
Fill my glass up one more time
We gon start it up right on time like (boom)
Yes indeed, all we needed is a hell of a beat like (boom)
And we gon to jam cause I'm feeling like a Yeah! tonight

[Chorus - repeat 2x]

[Verse - Juvenile]
She know about the grill and want to see my teeth
And if we ever bump heads they want to be my freak
She pulling on me cause she feel that heat
She don't wanna go to sleep she wanna feel that meat
That's a Lil Jon beat playa, run that back
It's aight if you kinda tipsy and you fall off track
I'm feeling great, I just had me a drink
She twurking over there, I'm bout to see what she thinks

[Bridge - Mario]
Say oh ohhh! Let's take it to the floor (B'More let's go)
Say yeah! do it like you don't care (WOO! A-Town!)
We gon do it all, from the windows to the wall
Let's gooo!! Let me see ya get low (get low) get low (get low)
Represent yo town (B'More! B'More!)
Throw up your hood (A-Town! A-Town!)
Represent yo town (Jersey! Jersey!)
Throw up your hood (get down now)
Represent yo town (LA let's go!)
Throw up your hood (Chicago!)
Represent yo town (Miami!)
Throw up yo hood (New York!)

[Chorus - repeat 2x]
