We're gonna do a song, you never heard before, or maybe you have
Regardless I want chy'all to make some noise now, yeah
This is the joyful rebellion, yeah, check it out
Yo, ring the alarm, I'm ready to drop the bomb, yeah
I'm not a muslim but I'll still say salaam
This is the calm before the storm, but is it righteous
Can I write the songs to make the world sing
She's slim, with a rude gal demeanor
Happy to meet ch'ya miss argentina vibe-dobaleaner
Picking my crown, to hold me down
I took it back, now he's crying the tears of the clown
I slayed goliath with the mic in my hand
But I still make'em jam on american band stand
A fool proof plan, but is it calculated
Can't be violated or even be imitated
It's highly anticipated like spaceships interfering
And if it's not true it's nice to beleive
In a return of original man, to slay the beef of the land
I'm dumbing it down, so clap your hands</pre>
