"My family tree, is my history" {*echoes*}

Yeah baby (yeah)
I baby, I baby you bet your life baby
That's right I'd die here
With the world's most populous drinking areas, you understand?
This is how I'd die, yeah
Everything is back, and they'd use what
And everybody here's waiting for the million dollar jackpot
number to come up man, and you know
It's a lot of shit, but that's just what the doctor said

Too much too soon! Hell yeah

Straight sound like the end of the world or armageddeon man
They need to find another way for people I talk to
Oughta know, who is gon' take the responsibility nigga

Say it

Too much too soon! Hell yeah

Say it
