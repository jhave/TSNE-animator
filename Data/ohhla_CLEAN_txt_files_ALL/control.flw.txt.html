[El-P]
You and your whole fuckin canned groove it'll end tepid
So when I Pearl Harbor don't let me catch you intrepid
I'm tellin you the wishbone been broke in my favor, crumbcake your mistake
Enterprise and see Indelible, the number one feel-bad crew of the season
Just give me one reason to splash
I shall lower the flag half mast, take time to wallow
Company Flow the toughest penis sucky sucky
So of course in an attempt to defend you end up unkempt
Plus this Agent get Orange 
E-L-P-F-C-F rock for you

First cousin to sleep, red dye number five be the potion
Enter subterrean water from gem of fate like stop motion
Best to get ak-a-nickulous
Our masks aren't intangible
Auto man verse mandible
We answer to no one, we 911
Silent alarm this is harm fear the duck of learning
El-P phase through these walls like vision
Choked in the shallow water, a bad executive decision
Release the crack and please put down your skin flutes
How could ya... motherfuckers think ya...
To this mercenary sunblock 2000 burner
All of your knowledge is truant
Unlearn all of the shit
Then in overtime you become fluent, sell the fuckin store
After I present enter the spectrum your career's never no more
Enter the rectum
And at twilight we'll skip stones and laugh about your poems
But a blood-red book when the others got funcrushed is a spot
The terror fabulously gets hot
Co Flow mossie, Walt Disney meets Kaiser Soze
There will be no grand comebacks unless Lazarus or Kotter
Inflicted bitch styles indicate with stigmata
when locked in a box but you can't say Jack
Trying to paint them fucking red doors black
Like that spilled milk spoiled
While Bill Gates and Ted Turner rub each other down with olive oils
Company Flow, fuck please
Bitch put away the fuckin piteous punchlines
Blue Blockers break under the red light, belittled by my design
I don't try to be different I am
So inevitably my style will survive when your now turns to then
El-P, vastly crapaphobic
3-2-1 Contact, never no more that's the promise
You hold toast, well I hold Thomas
Golden nooks and crannies 
Win my ticket raffled off the recycled thought shoppin spree winner
Congratu-fucking-lations, I dropped it now you got it
But it's only a matter of time before Waldo gets spotted
Pulled out of the crowd and martyred, a good old fashioned stonin
My children, the professional has left the fuckin buildin

	Check check check check check one two

	Until but for now			
	You can't get run at night		
	Curfews is issued in the daylight (repeat 3X)

[R.A. the Rugged Man] * [speaks over chorus vocals]
Yo yo, who the FUCK think they know about this hip-hop shit?
These motherfuckin kids LIVE this shit
Live they fuckin LIVES
Who the fuck you think you are?  Talkin bout this rap shit
These are the REAL motherfuckers (Population Control)
This IS the real hip-hop shit
Some shit that none of y'all faggot motherfuckers know about
That's word life!

[Bigg Jus]
The daylight goblin, even in the nights we rip shit up ("Bless my soul!")
The two franchise players that make your whole squad look butt
Who brought the March Madness competition til October
Got you thinking that shit became a bit little harder
These niggaz is fucking soldiers
Indelible mercenaries that's why ballin gets me on the nutsack
For the murderous intellect highly infections on contact
You need to come quicker than that
to snatch the cheddar from the mousetrap
Small timer, it takes crazy engineering
To fuck with anything from quantum physics to thought transmitters
Next up be that over .400 switch hitter
Out the park kingpin Dave couldn't do Justice ("Bless my soul!")
Pound for pound, it be these 2000 rap slugfests
Hardcore when future emcees fight future wars
But for now, I'm fightin a squad of super-whores
Butt-fucking invincible CoFlow skills for take-out
Where you can get the beef broccoli with extra duck sauce
The quick draw, intend to keep cops reachin for the bearclaws
Come meet the Coney Island intruder hit the arts way after midnight
Had a scheme for a burner etched out tonight in graphite
Apply the same ideology of b-boys demented to the mic
And scratch the sounds like a quarter inch bolt broken off
CoFlow, coming at you from every verse payola shit
Got stations blessin me off two thousand for every song minute
Secretly teach background vocals in R&amp;B clinics

	Until but for now			
	You can't get run at night		
	Curfews is issued in the daylight (repeat 3X)

[R.A. the Rugged Man] * [speaks over all other vocals]
Yo yo, this that MC shit
That shit talkin bout, every MC in this fuckin room is broke
Every one of em
We do this shit for the love of the music
That's word up, yo yo yo
Check this, ? backers
When's the last time you battled somebody you faggot motherfucker?
Yo yo, yo Company Flow in the house
Yo, yo yo, yeah, eh-heh, a-hah, Rugged Man, hah
