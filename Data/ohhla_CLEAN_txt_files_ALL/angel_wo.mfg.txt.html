There's no other reason to do this man
I mean everybody can be the greatest emcee in the world
Or the baddest or the toughest
But when you're capable of building and making something
And helping the babies, or family
That means more than platinum, mean more than Grammys
That's everything

[Verse 1]
Elders knew I was a talented baby
Pick 'em some numbers and then they would pay me
Sesame Street before photos they say cheese
Five years old, my friends all see me
How did he do it, cause Percy's on TV
Snuffleupagus, Bert and Ernie
Five already I make my own money 
Theme of show, days are sunny

Growing up knowing I was a talented baby
Growing up knowing I was a talented baby

[Verse 2]
My move to Elm Street was not funny
Freddy Kruger place was shady
Tragedy changed me
No sleep, nightmares go crazy
Turn into reaper and nothing can faze me
Growing up knowing I was a talented baby
Killing emcees and pushing up daisies
Life's a movie and I'm Scorsese
My pain is in panels and enemies frame me
Family disown me, laugh and shame me
People trying to play me
Convicted drug dealer is what they named me
Out of prison but still they don't free me
Praying to God that someone come save me

Growing up knowing I was a talented baby
Growing up knowing I was a talented baby

[Verse 3]
Others caught out there sleeping, but not me
Open fire, can't believe they got me
Legs not moving, lead paralyzed me
Gotta keep rolling, hope life surprise me
Angered with brothers, thinking they homies
Finding out later these people are phonies
Former disciples, I hear them say bad things
They form is of birds who love to sing

Growing up knowing I was a talented baby
Growing up knowing I was a talented baby

[Verse 4]
Call me a murderer in paper, oh that stings
Police hunt, deep cover, they set stings
Angel without wings
Wire is worn pretending they mic strings
Liars born fronting like they king
Scavengers look at them looking around for something
Holding a cordless connected to nothing
All a facade, they really just bluffing
Pushing up hill, I'm huffing and puffing
No longer hatred, I'm focused on loving

Growing up knowing I was a talented baby
Growing up knowing I was a talented baby

[Verse 5]
Arthur Ashe play tennis against me
KRS-One passed microphone to me
KC Ceja sign me to DC 
Ron Wimberly grab pen and he drew me
Made history with first triple cd
Battle Super Nat they said he defeated me
Puffy was judge, I knew he would cheat me
Learn from loss now no one can beat me
Freestyling, freestyling, listen, no that's not me
Battle on wax it's known no one can see me
Life is hard, wouldn't want you to be me
But life is beautiful, it's great to be me
Now I live happy
The love of my life, she finally got at me
Angel with wings, she came down and saved me
Talking of marriage and also having a baby

This song is dedicated to all the people who tried to break me
Your plan failed
And as you sit back and listen to this song
Wondering if I'm coming to get you
Don't worry about it, i'm not even going to touch you
you're not even worth it
And as far as I'm concerned
The best revenge is to become successful
So this is where you and I part ways
Here's to success
Have a nice life</pre>
