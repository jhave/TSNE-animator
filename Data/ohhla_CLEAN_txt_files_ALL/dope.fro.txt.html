A few words of inspiration 
This song is dedicated to hustlers standing on the curb 
Smokin herb, movin weight from the inner city to the suburbs 
Paranoid of jail, pocket full of yall, just waitin on another sale 
Sip your beer wipe your tears encourage your peers its gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright sell your dope make your money every night
Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight 
SELL YOUR DOPE keep on hustlin till your moneys right
You and your girl argue every night sell
your dope especially when your pockets tight
You cant find a job cuz your skin ain't white
sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right

Hey whattup lil inchworm
I hope this letter make you feel just a lil bit better
Got your t-shirt picked your khakis creased
so you can be g'd up when you get released
Me and my homeboys put together some Jimmys
to buy some beer and a couple of strippers
You can use my car till you find another
cant wait till you get home but later on 
that money you get from your GR check
should be enough to put you back on deck 
now I know you on parole but don't be scared
this time we be prepared
fuck the feds don't say shit to your broad
Keep your dope stashed in your neighbors yard 
When they kick in the door with they steel toed boot 
Won't find nothin but a lawsuit, baby baby

Everything is gonna be aright SELL YOUR DOPE
Make your money every night
Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight 
SELL YOUR DOPE keep on hustlin till your moneys right
You and your girl argue every night 
Sell your dope especially when your pockets tight
You cant find a job cuz your skin ain't white
Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right

Your baby momma she might trip
cuz you hangin with a Crip tryin to clock your grip
She can't help a black man out
but when bills come around she's got her hand out
The baby needs pampers and Similac..
Plus you need rims for your Cadillac
Ignore your girl when she starts trippin
keep them kilos flippin Dayton's dipin
We can expand by a little land
hand the dope game down to the next man
Buy a little business clean the money
look at the cops funny hey hey hey
Frontin in your caddy or  a beat up Taurus
got the baby gangsters sellin shit for us
we can dance underwater and not get wet
Sell crack on the internet but not yet

Everything is gonna be aright SELL YOUR DOPE
Make your money every night
Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight 
SELL YOUR DOPE keep on hustlin till your moneys right
You and your girl argue every night 
Sell your dope especially when your pockets tight
You cant find a job cuz your skin ain't white
Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right

Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight 
SELL YOUR DOPE keep on hustlin till your moneys right
You and your girl argue every night
sell your dope especially when your pockets tight
You cant find a job cuz your skin ain't white
sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right

1,2,3,4 breakdown
[singing and talking]

Early in the morning when I get outta bed
I chop up some quarter pieces and get ready for my cluck heads
I sell it all day baby you sell it all night long
Till the 15th comes around and everybody is all gone
I go out and buy some activator turn my fro into a jheri curl
Put the Daytona's on my lac and then I go scoop up my little girl
Baby don't try to change me if I go to the pen
Cuz when the white man lets me go I'm gonan do the same old thing again

Everything is gonna be aright SELL YOUR DOPE
Make your money every night
Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight 
SELL YOUR DOPE keep on hustlin till your moneys right
You and your girl argue every night 
Sell your dope especially when your pockets tight
You cant find a job cuz your skin ain't white
Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right </pre>
