[Intro: Raekwon (Ghostface Killah)]
Yo word up, yo Ghost come here
Ooh, you in trouble
Yo Ghost man, you haven't found out
(What, what happened?)
I know she is frontin' (for real son)
Nah, nah man come on
She is on the block son (damn)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
She said you couldn't deny it
Why did you try to hide it?
You buggin, it's just like you
Tell me what am I suppose to do?
Should have told me long time ago
Baby I would not have walked out the door
You tried to deny your own flesh and blood

[Mary J. Blige]
I couldn't believe my ears when she told me
You had a child and she was the girl
I thought I meant more to you
Shared thoughts with you, held hands with you
You loved only you, not me and not your child
Tell me why, is not worth your while

[Chorus]

[Mary J. Blige]
So many things you need to do
Like take care of your responsibilities
Stand tall and be a man, strong and understand
That the truth will set you free
No need for you to lie, to hurt on me
She said it and I believe it

[Chorus]

[Mary J. Blige]
What can I do, said it - I won't play with you
*singing various lines over each other*
You tried to deny your own flesh and blood

[Ghostface Killah]
It was the one night stand and the chick tracked me off
I was drunk and the stink-witch slit the condom off
We got seven years in, now boo now picture me
This Hollywood big-head bitch don't mean shit to me
Your eyes look sad and you are hurt boo, pardon
Self, put the drink down, Scotch is bad for your health
Why you slapped me in my sleep, with steamin
Hot grits in the bowl, fiendin to throw it at me
Chill! (Don't try to deny your own flesh and blood)

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
