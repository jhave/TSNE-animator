AAAAAAWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOO!!

(Sondoobiest)
Mic smugglers, hustlers, hold your jugglers
Forty guzzlers, muscular, Son'll fuck wit'cha
One of ya, actin' funnier, think you're hungrier
Some of y'all know, the streets stay ghetto govenor
Swash Buckler, Club King, pull the gun to her
For the love of her, punish 'em, drop they juggler
Son's guns stompin' dirt, hurts come at runnier
Son's luckier, put your money up and stumbler
Raise her birthday, cut yo' - Son Gun-the-Gun
Comes from vomit coke, drunk number runs
Club tumblers who thug wit' us - double up
Mother-luggers shots blast, Ice what the fuck?!!</pre>
