[Verse One]
Words of wisdom, knowledge of understandin
To be like me takes practice and plannin
Come out fresh, like graANNNNNND openin
Fender bender, loan shark lender
Kareem changed his name, from Lew Alcindor
The Bob Barker, the {?} stopper
The mad harper, the Cyndi Lauper
To be or not to be a celebrity
A little, comedy with Eddie Murphy
Grandmaster Flash, Treacherous Three
And the King of Rockers, Run-D.M.C.
To all the girls and boys, like to make noise
Crazy gents, spendin dollars and cents
Women and men that borrow and lend
And all the children that try to pretend
to be a Prince {?}, or Jackson
Now my man Michael loves to eat cycle
crazy wings off the gravy train
My great dane Joey, so bowl a household
With the b-boy product that'll help them grow
We don't give 'em milk because that give 'em the craps
We feed 'em um, sausages and liver snaps
but seriously, I'm in the place to be
But it ain't a place to be without me me me
Between herpes and AIDS, I'd rather have VD
Gonorrhea syphillis is a real bad case
You get goner in her pants, rhea in her face
I wouldn't stick mine in her, beeehind
{*babbling*} a without vine
{*babbling*} one heck of mine, mine mine mine
