C-C
It's 2000 sir
The World Ain't Enuff
C-C Yeah
Right Here (Lock Down)
Take it back, Take it to the streets know what I'm saying
Understand Me

Tela! Who is the nigga in the beam with them thangs Tela
Who is the nigga that leans on your brains Tela
Who is the nigga with the quality ice Tela
Hollering out fuck the price Tela
Who is the nigga in the wide body frame Tela
Who is the nigga see reflections off the chain Tela
Who is the nigga that act bad with the laws
Keep a pistol in his draws and act bad with your broads Tela
Who is the nigga that'll never be broke Tela
Who is the nigga take sales like coke Tela
Who is the nigga that'll hide the dope
So real in the rims of a Seville and find the folks Tela
Who is the nigga that gets fast like cast Tela
Who is the nigga say splash on your bitch ass Tela
Who is the nigga that's doing his thing
Since 89' I been pinkied the ring know what I mean bling Tela

Chorus
Ya'll Want Who Tela x8

Who is the nigga that rush the shows with dimes Tela
Who is the nigga that dust your nose like lines Tela
Who is the nigga ride the Jag with three pounds Tela
Put your ass where you can't be found Tela
Who is the nigga stay sprayed all day Tela
Who is the nigga say fuck platinum shades
Who is the nigga say put the ice in it
Let the lights hit it
And look nice in it Tela
Who is the nigga in the aqua-blue Gators Tela
Who is the nigga that will hop through the haters Tela
Who is the nigga that's defining thangs
For ballers to do from splitting capers to big stangs Tela
Who is the nigga say do true thangs Tela
Who shot a video at Blue Flames Tela
Who is the nigga that keeps it off the chain
And still let it rain Hold up pimpin man you know me Tela

Chorus x8

Who is the nigga see the sun in the south Tela
Who is the nigga hundred guns in the house Tela
Who is the nigga rock the tank with the mink Tela
And leave the bank with the got damn sink Tela
Who is the nigga that switch records labels Tela
Who is the nigga say fuck em' if they ain't able Tela
Who is the nigga that stay five deep
With top quality hoes that'll shoot up your Jeep Tela
Who is the nigga that holds his own like the ace Tela
Who on a song with Short and Face Tela
Who is the nigga keep the snow in lumps
I get stopped by the pos and say go with the pumps Tela
Who is the nigga to hot to swap it up Tela
I say fuck it buy shit and glock it up Tela
Who is the nigga that did Sho Nuff'
I got Pac posted up tellin em Tossing it Up
