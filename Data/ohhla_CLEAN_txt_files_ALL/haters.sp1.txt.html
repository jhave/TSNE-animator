(Chorus)
Haters - come out and play-a
Don't make us - get out and spray-a
Bleed teeth and gums - murder and money
Illegal funds - it's all part of the game

(Spice 1)
Ain't no nigga stupid enough to be my motherfuckin' enemy
My name causes violence in projects and penitentiaries, nigga
Cut off the lights and say my name in the mirror
five times, light a candle watch a gangsta appear
and pull a fo'-fo' up outta my brim nigga, see that's your ass
Spiceberg Slim, O.G. Gangster from outta the past
Been to Hell and back, tryin' to get to Ghetto Heaven
move to Vegas my nigga, had to register as a felon
Gotta problem with guns, six cases in three states (states)
Move over one time, throw the shit in my face
But I ain't trippin', I stay caddy dippin' and plush shit
From L.A. to the bay, back down to the Las Vegas strip
Haters, come out and play, bitches, guns and money
Illegal funds, fast cars and gun play
One way or another, your boy gon' come laced
What the fuck is you gon' do when my heater's in your face, nigga?

(Chorus)
Haters - come out and play-a
Don't make us - get out and spray-a
Bleed teeth and gums - murder and money
Illegal funds - it's all part of the game

(Spade)
S.P. stand for super pimpin'
Mr. Spade and Spiceberg, cold as iceberg
It's the return of that gangsta - shit
no matter the record sales gon' be gangsta
Chills be ain't it's clientele by any means of bail
Dirty money lovers and niggas slippin' I cheat 'em
I pack dick for bitches and haters a pepper heater
You draw blood with the fan bam and they won't see ya
Murder, murder, we gorillas, either feel us
or put a dick in your mouth I hit with banana killers
My game a mile long, y'all talkin' millimeters
We pitch birds we're better known as California Stillers
Take your bitch from up under your nose
Talk a virgin right up out of her clothes
It's all part of the game you love hatin' the name
Hard time connect g's with g's
They thought they'd never see me bustin' with S-P-I-C-E
So fuck 'em

(Chorus)
Haters - come out and play-a
Don't make us - get out and spray-a
Bleed teeth and gums - murder and money
Illegal funds - it's all part of the game

(Spice 1)
Who the fuck is these old one mill funny built ass niggas?
Fuck around somewhere and get they self killed ass niggas
Keep my ear to the street (street), plan at the the concrete
Who the fuck you niggas say about a G like me?
You ain't never seen a motherfucker from broke to paid
paid to broke and back to paid nigga I'm self made
So check yourself before you get A.K.-ed
in front of the liqour store with your mouth open and your car sprayed, partner
Don't mix yourself up with a nigga like me
Me hang around motherfuckers like Jayo Felony
Flesh-N-Bone, Makaveli nigga R.I.P., Yukmouth, Outlawz, Wino - straight G's
And we all got the motherfuckin' thug disease
C-Bo, Mack 10, E-40 and 2-Sheez (Sheez)
B-Legit, Daz, Kurupt, Ras Kass &amp; Ja Rule (Rule)
I'm straight outta Cali but I'll still fuck with Coo-Coo

(Chorus)
Haters - come out and play-a
Don't make us - get out and spray-a
Bleed teeth and gums - murder and money
Illegal funds - it's all part of the game
Haters - come out and play-a
Don't make us - get out and spray-a
Bleed teeth and gums - murder and money
Illegal funds

(Spice 1)
It's all part of the game</pre>
