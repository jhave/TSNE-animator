What ya want girl, what ya need girl
Here go, come on, don't act like that

I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning
She's so fine that it should be a sin, hey, hey
Good Lord shorty, sure looking sporty
I keep knockin' knockin' but you won't let me in, whoo

I be dog-gone, hell to the yeah, you fine as a camel hair
Ain't near a mammal anywhere Danny compared to you, boo boo
I know I'm country, but you want me to touch you don't you
Wanna get raunchy don't you, why don't you call me
You built like a Barbie doll because you so dag-gone fine
This old mind of mine twist all kind of ways
I'm catching vertigo from a girl that's so voluptuous
Plus striking, damn near venomous
And I'm liking the way you looking lady
Somebody cooking the right meat and potatoes baby
I'm feelin' the way you fillin' up that skirt
Stoppin' traffic, droppin' jaws like bad habits
When you walkin', dag nabbit
You so purdy and I'm dirty, dirty
And it hurt me when you're flirty
And all nerdy but you're sultry
Giving me goose bumps like poultry
I ain't chicken though, you stickin' close to me
Could be a beautiful thing fo' sho'

I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning
She's so fine that it should be a sin
Good Lord shorty, sure looking sporty
I keep knockin' knockin' but you won't let me in

She got me crumbling, mumbling
Stepping on my tongue and stuttering
Hovering, wondering, you know I got that junky loving
Give me some rubbing, it ain't gotta be hard
I just wanna mow the backyard
You know my thought, don't try to dodge it
I'm not here to take anything, I just wanna make a deposit
Don't be scared, that's just my beard
I know I sound kinda weird but I'm fond of your rear
Don't scream my ear, you remind me of my girlfriend
And her girlfriend, come on girl let's have some children
In a whirlwind, you got me spinning like a 45
I feel like a tractor trailer rolling over on 85
I need eighty wives to keep up with my eighty lives
Everywhere I go I'm still the new guy with new lies
Let's go mami, time to get busy
I'm taking five dramamines just in case I get dizzy

I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning
She's so fine that it should be a sin, she's so fine
Good Lord shorty, sure looking sporty
I keep knockin' knockin' but you won't let me in

You bangin', sugar booger, I know I'm just one in a tonne
A young son of a gun, just wanting some of you honey
And I ain't got much money, I know I'm fat but I'm funny
And I'm a hard worker and I never give up
I do whatever it takes just to live up to your expectations
No sex (what) well then I'll be patient
I really hate to toot my own horn but a ooh gah
But it's looking to me boo like you need a new guy
What you want, a Late, a ham on rye
Girl I'm just trying to get in your bloodstream
Like E Coli, you so fly, you got the pelican flyin'
Just tell me what I gotta do to get a thigh
A breast or wing or something
Up above of all the pumpkins, what am I a bumpkin
Straight out of Atlanta, Rehab or something
I just wanna be with you, lay up in the hay with you
Say hey to you, you know you could do ? together

I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning
She's so fine that it should be a sin
Good Lord shorty, sure looking sporty
I keep knockin' knockin' but you won't let me in

I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning
She's so fine that it should be a sin
Good Lord shorty, sure looking sporty
I keep knockin' knockin' but you won't let me in

What ya want girl, I got a whole lot
What ya need girl, I got a whole lot
What ya want girl, I got a whole lot
What ya need girl, I got a whole lot
What ya want girl, I got a whole lot
What ya need girl, I got a whole lot
What ya want girl, I got a whole lot
What ya need girl, I got a whole lot

Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy</pre>
