[A.D.O.R.]
Internation-al
A.D.O.R. urban guerillas, pure terrorism
100 strong beats, comin at'cha
All in your area
Pure microphone terrorist
When they hear this they always say to me, "Damn man!"

[Verse One]
They say Mister, Amazing, you're so John Blazing
Cause everything you spit, melts heads like gamma rays and
I'm crazin to mash kids who steal my arts
'Renegade Master' for the raw, not for the charts
I better get my pounds, exchange 'em for the dollars
Or all them bitch thieves, is gonna feel the horror
"Back once again" it's the A.D.O.R.
Rockin 100 strong beats, from New York to Lazarar(?)
Smoke cigars with fly cats at the Casbah
Fly home, smoke the hydro out the glass jar
Damn those who got it better than this
It's all internation-al, come on now

[Chorus]
Superfly, why oh why
The way you rock that shit make me feel so high
Superfly, why oh why
The way you rock that shit make me feel so high
Superfly, why oh why
The way you rock that shit make me feel so high
Superfly

[Verse Two]
Yo, mmm
I got my lady, Tru Reign, soon the ill Mercedes
'Shock Frequency' to drive all the fans crazy baby
So much, it makes me hazy like the hash
God bless my first born, comin soon to the cast
A.D.O.R.'s about to dash, makin moves like mafia
My wolves hold all stacks, sayin nothing's stoppin ya
Organized organism, revolution realism
Prepare for new order, prepare A.D.O.R.'s prism
Blast off into my world unknown
Where execution is of MC's on jagged microphones
It's Mister, Amazing, so John Blazing
Here to send this whole fuckin world into a craze

[Chorus]

Mister Amazing..
All real high..
So John Blazing..
Get 'em all real high..
Make 'em all feel high..
Urban Guerillas

[Verse Three]
Blaze a 100 strong beats from New York to English streets
From France to Germany, a dog begins to creep
on your radio, your video, in your stereo
Take this uppercut, BLAOW, now here we go
Feel the rain and the pain of the master
Gotcha high, no doubt it's comin at'cha
Pure thug with that dusted love
John Blaze, always, c'mon now

[Chorus]

Mister Amazing
Mister Amazing..</pre>
