[Intro] [Phonte Speaking]
She told me I've taken her to places she has never been before, but really
She was taking me places I promised myself I'd never go to
Pff, damn, let me start from the beginning

Alright now
I want all of you brothers to get ready for some sho' 'nuff sweet honey
For your mouth

[Verse One]
Some say she was from Cali
Some say the Carolinas
Mom was a belly dancer
Pop was a never minder
No drugs or alcohol and
No weed or marijuana
You think the backstage was the last place you'd find her
First time I saw her, kinda
Reminded me a of them chicks you see at CaroWina
Friendly and talkative and
Lookin' so marvelous had
That nigga Tay 
Feelin' like Li'l Ze in the City Of Goddess
But, I'm digressing'
Please pardon if, I start trailin' off 
Or fadin' out of my consciousness
It's just that when I think of ole' girl my whole world collapses 
I, was so enraptured in all of her flawlessness 
She approaches me with a smirk 
That said, we can do work 
No matter what time or day of the week it is 
So thorough that backstage girl 
She'll fall to her knees just to pray on your weaknesses

[Phonte talking]
I mean I told her straight up, you know
I got a significant other. She ain't care
She said, "For tonight I just wanna be your insignificant other."
Huh, what?
God damn!

[Verse Two]
Oh we left the club at around two
Just enough time to meet my niggas for round two
At another spot, DJ playing the sounds too 
Hopefully divert me from being a scoundrel 
In the spot making my rounds through
The crowd trying to throw her off 
But she's on me like a bloodhound Jew
Wouldnt believe how hard I tried to fight it
Passions and desires were closin' in
And thats what it amounts to
I looked her in the eyes
And say, "I dont even know your name
It feels wrong even though I dont show it."
She said, "I wish I could tell you the same
But I won't tell you my name 
Cause I want you to fuck me like you dont know it."
I responded with a smirk 
To let her know we can work 
No matter what time or day of the week it is
So thorough, that backstage girl 
Fell down to her knees just to pray on my weaknesses
Maaaan can you fight her? Go head

You'd think the backstage would be the last place you'd find her 
You'd think the backstage would be the last place you'd find her

Been ridin' all around the world
Seen so many faces
But I'm always lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Been ridin' all around the world, seen so many faces
Backstage girl
But I'm always lookin' for love in all the wrong places

[Phonte talking]
I woke up the next morning all tangled up in her hair 
That's when I realized she had me all where she wanted me
She told me I'd taken her to places she'd never been before
But really she took me to a place I promised myself I'd never return to
And I was fucked up 
And the thing was I didn't feel bad about what I've done
I just felt stupid for trying to fight it for so long
I mean really who I was fooling?
I knew what time it was soon as I saw her
Soon as she smiled at a nigga I could tell what the favorite position was
And I damn sure gave it to her
I thought I had changed
But niggas never changes
But it took that one night
That one passionate night for me to realize what I needed to do
I gotta stop fucking with these hoes off of Myspace dawg

Some say she was from Cali
Some say the Carolinas
Mom was a belly dancer
Pap' was a never minder
No drugs or alcohol
No weed or marijuana
You'd think the backstage was the last place you'd find her</pre>
