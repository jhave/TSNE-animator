[P. Diddy]
Bad Boys 2, the soundtrack
Let's Go

[Verse 1: Nelly] + (P. Diddy)
Hey girl
What your name is?
Where you from?
Turn around who you came with?
Is that your ass or your momma have reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrolls, you know I never changed that (nah uh)
Your body is banging mamma, but where your brains at? (Come on)
I'm still the same cat when I was young I was running with bad boys
But now I'm older hope they saw I'm running with bad boys (that's right)
Here come another man
Unlike no other man
Candy coated whoa!
Switching in every lane
Ya'll help me
Why don't cha
Please help me
A thug is we then it's only two G
I like the cocky bow legged ones
Like white and Dominicans
Hispanics and Asians
Shake it for Nelly son
Manolos Ma-no-no's I can't tell
Everybody and their hootchies
When you do it do it well

{*Braves tomahawk chop done in background of Chorus*}

[Chorus]
[Nelly] Let me see you take it off
[P. D.] Girl go and take it off
[Nelly] We can even do it slow
[P. D.] We can even do it slow
[Nelly] Take it where you want to go
[P. D.] Take it where you want to go
[Nelly] Just take that ass to the floor
[P. D.] Pop something move something
Shake ya tail feather, girl go and take it low
[Nelly] We can even do it slow
[P. D.] We can even do it slow
[Nelly] Take it where you want to go
[P. D.] Take it where you want to go
[Nelly] Just take that ass to the floor
[P. D.] Pop something move something
Shake ya tail feather

[Verse 2: P. Diddy] + (Nelly)
Now real girls get down on the floor (on the floor)
Get that money honey act like you know (like you know)
Mama I like how you dance
The way you fit in them pants (Uh)
Enter the floor (Uh) take it low (Uh) girl do it again (Uh)
You know I love that (I love that)
Now where them girls at? (Where the girls at?)
It's Diddy, Murphy Lee, and Nelly how you love that? (Shit uh ohhhhhh)
Come on, we got another one player
From New York to the Dirty how they loving it player?
Baby you impressive let's get
To know each other
You the best of the best and
You got to love it in the dresses, the sexiest
I had to tell her she's a young Janet Jackson live in living color
Look here momma you're dead wrong for having them pants on
Capri's cut low so when you shake it I see you're thong
My pocket's full of dough shake your feathers till the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly man somebody better warn them

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Nelly]
Oh no I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now
Got to continue my running (yea)
Because we go party till them lights come on
And then my song start thumping because my mike still on

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee] + (Nelly)
Yo, I'm the big booty type
I like them thick with their mind right (Awe)
Banging personality conversate when the time right (Naw)
I'm not hard I've got women to handle that
They be like he the man when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on you know the tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass popo thinking we mow lawns
My gohans don't match that
But it matches her head wrap and the seats that I got in the lap
I'm just a juvenile (Wha)
Because I be about G's
Keep your women wizzy man they say they have my babies
I'm young like Tucker like the cash and the money (I'm going to eat my money)
Man, I'm that damn hungry
See I'm starving like Marvin girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire is what I'm starting
Plus my rats come in packs like Sammy and Dean Martin
And I got so many keys you'd think I was valet parking

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Nelly]
Oh no I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now
Got to continue my running (yea)
Because we go party till them lights come on
And then my song start thumping because my mic still on (man)
