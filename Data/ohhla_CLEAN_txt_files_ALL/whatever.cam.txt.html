[Cam'Ron]
I'm in the whip, pedal smashin it
Mase went to chruch, settled down, imagine it
Who me? Devil's Advocate Shit
Tell a tail to cry, just so you could fail to lie
Me, Un, Suge, Pac would go to jail and die for this
Fuck school, A&amp;E murder majors, CLK's insert the flavors
Now listen to the coach cause you heard the players
Got schemin' targets
Philly hoes boost clothes from out of Neiman Marcus
Real hot while you fast to melt
Gucci jean suit, jacket felt, oh yeah, matchin belt
Uh, she so independent
But I slapped her, why? cause I ain't slapped a ho in a minute
I'm low, low, low in a Range Rov tinted
Same fo frontin', be the same fo who'll get it
Uh, and we big cats, jig cats, clcik triggas
Pig nigga, bring the hook in 6 figures

[Chorus]
For my cats with the ice, who don't need no wife
We getting head tonight (Whatever)
To all my honeys that stall, give a dummy a call
Get his money and ball (Whatever)

[Cam'Ron]
Cats don't mess with ya'll, cause ya'll are dummies
Cats fuck with me cause I tell, "Let's get money"
Get it, get a benz, come through on 20s
Me and Jim Jones, stay fighting 2 on 20
Fuck it, the hoods scary and all my whips they should vary
You cheap niggaz still shopping up up in woodbury
I'm Viv Westwood, Karl Lagerfeld, Salvatore Ferragamo, John Galliano
And my girls they be blessin' me first
Took 'em out of Foot Locker and that referee shirt
And I put that on the death of me first, test me, an'll squirt
Best be alert, cause yo sexy could hurt
Uh, cause one thing I can't stand is a pussy chick
I need a "Here ma, goof this in your pussy" chick
All these sleazes trying to be my Hillary, Winnie or Wheezy
LADIES TAKE IT EASY

[Chorus]
To all my cats in the club, who be dead at the bar
We getting head in the car (Whatever)
To all my women whippin' a Jeep, getting it sweet
Have 'em licking your feet (Whatever)

[Cam'Ron]
Yo, yo, let's stab 'em, let's stick 'em
Let's get 'em, get all of his spinach
Grab 'em, and flip 'em, while Killa get all of the women
Bakardi in lemon, Ferri at lemon, party in Lennon
Sorry I'm limbin', I'm just fronin' ya'll; ya tittes
I'll touch 'em, I'll kiss 'em, I'll hug 'em, I'll suck 'em
If I'm with a chick, most likely I'm trying to fuck 'em
Not tryin' cuff 'em, tryin' a duck 'em, lyin' I love 'em
Have with a pie in they're oven
Shit, to me, ya'll a dime a dozen
No time for buzzin', beat it, go find a husband
Shit, that'll trick on you, buy you a ton of clothes
I'm at the Tunnel, they let in 500 hoes
I'm at the bar, see shorty is bent
My ratio up in here, fucked 40 percent
Shit, drink is sour, armaretta, yo
Whatever, forever, but won't stop my chedda

[Chorus]
For all my cats with the ice, who don't need no wife
We getting head tonight (Whatever)
To my honey's that stall, give a dummy a call
Get his money and ball (Whatever)

To all my cats in the club, who be dead at the bar
We getting head in the car (Whatever)
To all my women whippin' a Jeep
Getting it sweet, have 'em licking ya feet (Whatever)

[Cam'Ron]
And I don't care how bad no chick is, I ain't licking nobody's feet
(Whatever) Killa (Whatever)</pre>
