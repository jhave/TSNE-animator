[DMC]
Force set up the hip-hop police
Can't find peace in the Middle East
Some punk rapper always gots to beef
What's goin on with all the priests
Church should be shamed about what they did
First PlayStation never touched the kids
This revelation is a prophecy
The only way out is you and me
We gotta sit and wait then go to sleep
The promise of the kids I gotta keep
Life is rough enough on the street
I gotta make sure that we all can eat
Chuck said rap is like CNN
We keep tunin out instead of tunin in
And while we're sleepin they're watchin us
And instead of watchin them we're not wakin up

[Josh Todd from Buckcherry]
There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the Joker to the King
There's too much con-fu-sion
I can't get no relief

[DMC]
It's easy for D to be the all-time great
And now I be the one they'll assassinate
I'm talkin on the topic and I'm talkin truth
Cause I know knowledge can save the youth
Here's how the dollars need to be used
We got a choice to save the schools
Billionaires, millionaires and trillionaires
They say that the money is never there
Tell me the truth, tell me you don't care
You profit off the music and the clothes I wear
You gettin that money, yeah that's all good
You ain't doin a damn thing for the hood
You ain't doin anything you know you should
You ain't doin anything you know you could
It be the dollar dollar dollar and you gotta gotta lotta
But you don't know what hip-hop means to Bambaataa

[Josh Todd from Buckcherry]
No reason to get excited
The thief he got exposed
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke

{*long interlude and guitar solo*}

[Josh Todd from Buckcherry]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Them and servants too, yeah alright

[DMC: repeat 6X]
This revelation is a prophecy
The only way out is you and me</pre>
