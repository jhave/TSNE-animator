[Fat Joe]
When you got producers, umm, right now
Rappin and puttin out albums
Y'know, Diamond was probably one of the first EVER
To be a producer/DJ
And, I don't even think he took rappin SERIOUS
He just woke up one day and was like "Yo I'ma rap"
And he made a classic
"Psychotic Neurotic" was a CLASSIC, ALBUM
If you go through that right there that shit is so amazin
That album, that music is so incredible
And y'know, I didn't know how he did it!</pre>
