Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Aye Jada, we gon fuck em up with this one homie
Believe dat

[Verse 1]
I got the spot goin crazy, all the hoes on me
Me, I'm kissin this bitch, you know I'm certified homie
A couple thou on my pocket so when it's time to act reckless
We in the craziest spots, I ain't gotta tuck in my necklace
Say fuck I'm bowin perfections, prolly tossin up dollars
They can't do it like me, they just some fuckin impostors
Smoking the finest, my flow so sick, go and vomit it
I ain't gotta tell you muhfuckas wizzles I prop

[Chorus]
From Ohio to Yonkers
Bow and Kiss got the streets going bonkers
You know me, pullin up and stuntin foolish
A lot of niggas in the game but they don't do it like we do it

[Verse 2]
I'm on my JOB, but I'm self-employed
All that hollin they doin, tryna makin them noise
And we don't talk, they can't fade us, me and my nigga Jada
See 2 things you don't mess with
(What's that?) my kid and my paper
From the south to the east, they know the boy is a beast
They sayin that I'm the truth
Boy that's the word on the streets
And if you ask em who got it right now, they'll tell you it's me
D Block and YMCMB, homie who hotter than we?

[Chorus: x2]
From Ohio to Yonkers
Bow and Kiss got the streets going bonkers
You know me, pullin up and stuntin foolish
A lot of niggas in the game but they don't do it like we do it

[Verse 3]
I'm always reppin the hood 'cus I came out of the street
I got a zip of the loud, I got that powder for cheesh
And I could go to the whole thing, all I got is a 3
Fiends is lovin the work, yea so I'm proud of my D
Just the sound of my voice will get you out of yo seat
I'm pullin up in the Porsche, it's either that or the Jeep
I love sneakers and ice but I'm a addict for beach
Just bad bitches and smoke that's coming out of the suite
If you playin the game make sure you do it for keeps
And if you movin them things make sure you do it discrete
Yea, I'm bringin the thunder, so you ain't gotta wonder
'Cus I'm a do my number, straight from YO to Columbus, wizzle

[Chorus: x2]
From Ohio to Yonkers
Bow and Kiss got the streets going bonkers
You know me, pullin up and stuntin foolish
A lot of niggas in the game but they don't do it like we do it</pre>
