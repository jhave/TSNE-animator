Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Follow me as I get high, and ride
In the car I just bought, but I prolly never drive
I heard it's easier that way
My weed is gettin' stronger my Visa is gettin' straight
My whole team is gettin' cake
Call us leaders in the game, niggas follow cause they need us
Ain't just wannabe's they want to be us
That's why they throw our gang up when they see us
Rollin' planes up, hear them niggas who talk the same
But they ain't us
Took my success and I shared it with everyone next to me
So they sayin' that we came up
Got some fire weed and some niggas down to smoke
So we all gon' be high as can be
At that point you aspire to be
Hermes belt, I'm the flyest degree

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
The view from my lair
Will have a married woman playin' truth or dare
At my crib cleanin' rooms in there
So many shoes, you think I buy my shoes a pair
A fuckin' fool, highed up with Pittsburgh pimpin'
Ever since my old crib, splittin' ounces
Goin' half on Chinese food
To flights Hawaiian, a two week cruise excursion
Far from the madness splurging
Learnin' 'bout scuba gear, sting ray sea urchins
Do it for my old heads
Same way they would've done for the OG's before them
They like, "how thick is your skin?"
I been through Hell and back fillin' up the tank for another spin
All the way out there goin' in, cash pourin' in
Gas pedals to the floor in 'em vintage wheel historian
Open the garage door finna bring another in</pre>
