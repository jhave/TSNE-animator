[Buckshot]
WHAT! Black Moon up in this
Y'all wanna know why ya can't fuck wit this
When you see Buckshot cuff ya mitts
If you get jealous fellas you gon' feel the fist
We on the block now wit twenty-five deep
Makin heads turn when we walk the streets
They all looked shocked when they see Buckshot
Before the show gettin out of van parked in the lot
Ready for the spot, blow shit up
Let me see some hands, throw shit up
Whatever you at, represent that on the map
Rest in peace to the wack, we wear all black
Huh, you can smoke a black or sip a Cognac
But, when the Moon is Black, where the Ruger at
What? Where the Ruger at, where the Ruger at 
What? Where the Ruger at, where the Ruger at

[Chorus] 2x
JUMP UP! All my niggas in the house
Raise up ya blunts just once
I'm bringin it back (BACK!) to the o-riginal Crook
Flippin the book and flippin the hook, ah

[Buckshot]
Place my hand up in the
Position for the cheddar, I'm a beginn-er
I used to be a loser, now I'm a winn-er
Feel the frost from the New York cold wint-er
I'm B-K bound, bubble goosed down
Still in the heart of Bucktown holdin my crown
The look on my face was cuz I mashed them niggas
Word life son, I had to bash them niggas
You didn't know the Buck, Black Moon or what?
Like dice '94-5-6 and up
If I'm up inside a club then I'm lookin at bud
If it don't be a dime then it might be a slut
But either way yo, we gon' play yo
And we can do it from the night until the day yo aiyyo

Chorus 2x

[Buckshot]
Niggas on the block is jealous of me
Jealous cuz they see a nigga frequently
B-D-B shine like jewelry
Bust like a mothafuckin three-eigh-ty
Reload the clip automatically
We known to flip automatically
You can call Buckshot Your Majesty
Ain't another little nigga bad as me
Black Moon attack the industry
Duck Down niggas can't fuck wit me
Duck Down niggas can't fuck wit me
You a wannabe, straight fraud to me
When you see Buckshot applaud to me
Applaud to me, what

Chorus 2x

[Buckshot]
JUMP UP! All my niggas in the house 
JUMP UP! All my niggas in the house 
JUMP UP! (Raise up ya blunts just once)
Either way yo, either way yo
We gonna do it from the night until the day yo
But either way yo, either way yo
We gonna do it from the night until the day yo, aiyyo

"Security come up here, make this change
So the boys can have some room 
Girls, no grabbin unless your grabbin low
Hey hey one two"</pre>
