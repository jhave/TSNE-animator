[Intro: Terra Tory (Talib Kweli) {Suga Bang Bang}]
Hahahahahaha, we gon' do what we do right here, baby
You already know what it is, Division, back in the building
Brooklyn, you see 'em? Haha (yeah, come on) {soldier hold ya sword high}
{Swing it like a Samurai} Who are we?

[Talib Kweli]
We the breadwinners, baby, make it peel, sippin' blunts
Smokin' guns, taught M.C.'s how these niggas living
Earn, burning word for ya, curb serving
Got you hooked by the first purchase, birds chirping
Cops listening, with the gun sitting on they lap
Cuz of that, the t-shirt's on the block, like 'stop snitching'
Living by the code of the samurai
Dreams put on hold like operators standing by
What you craft with your heart or your weapon
It's a question, what you craft with, a glock or a message in a rhyme
I teach you little savage part of a lesson and choice
Between being a gangsta and an artist, is the start of your ending
You can front like you a gangsta artist, but that ain't the smartest
Decision, niggas'll test you
Say you ain't the hardest, regardless, what you spare homey
RZA told me that the game is flipping, nobody bent for me

[Interlude: Terra Tory]
Haha, you already know what it is
Murda is back in the building
Division, back in the building

[Free Murda]
Free Murda dick longer than the O.J. trial
Have your bitch backstage with the Colgate smile
I'm on the back glocks where the coke ring loud
Bullets got flat tops like they stole Kane's style
Warm 'em kid, you wanna flow, drain now
Get your whole brain out, where your hoes hang out
It's killing me, everybody got cocaine nail
Stealing Free is like trying take a old stain out
Your boy's on fire, my boat stays out
It's gon' take more than a wire, to close they mouth
Got a slice of that bread, bags that you stole
You had a price on your head, now that tag's on your toe
And you know that nigga dead when the casket is closed
Off with his dreads, keep the mag' in my clothes
I'm trying, real good, the semi' got loud up
You can die in your hood, like Kenny from South Park

[Chorus 2X: Free Murda]
How many licks does it take
For me to hit the tootsie roll center of a break?
Yeah, how many hits must you make
Before a man'll get his mule and his forty ac's

[Suga Bang Bang]
Soldier hold your sword high...
Swing it like a Samurai...
Now don't get all out of pride...
