Well I'm droppin a bomb, funky rhymes for the dancefloor
Rhymes flow on, styles come quicker
You've been outfoxed by the metaphor slicker
Think twice, go slow, words'll flow
Now speed up rhymes like a pro-
-fessional poet, comin back and you know it
I treat your brain like a whistle, pick it up and I blow it
Four times with rhymes, look and stop for signs
Detour, go back, hit your brakes and stop
You're just a floor that's dirty toy, come battle the Mop
'n'Glow and, stealin the show and
You stay down low'n, while I keep goin
Around the clock, kickin rhymes, the mic is on overtime
Back and front, drunk dizzy here's a sober rhyme
Tellin your braincells that I am the best one
Rappers who perpetrate, come jump up and test one
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down
You and your man, sit down, sit down, Trev tell 'em sit down
Rhymes go on and dip so quick by
Stand and wait fool, and yo yo stick by
Stand inside, look around and you'll see me
Join the party

Takin off where I left, from back to step
Movin nicely, the rhythm precisely
Groove entice me, to change and twist up
Another rhyme stick up, stickin the gritty one
Lyrical screw one, all rhymes are blocked up
I gotta get through one, the lines and change up
The lyrics are noticed, but my style is stranger
Look at, look, learn, while I surprise you
My job is to talk down, and rhyme despise you
You're whack, whack, double whack, triple whack
So weak not fresh, no you'll never impress me
You think you can flow, when you stop and address me
Test me, bless me, hmmm.. as I rhyme every day
I'm more mature, so go on kids and play
with your blocks and rocks
Throw your rhymes in the dirt pile, and back in the swing of things
The party and meanwhile you're lost, lookin, puzzled, stupid
Dumb, silly, dookie, bum, fool, illiterate
Your brain get rid of it
Drop it off in the trash, cause my rhymes are mac-10
And kept in the stash when I flip on, grip on
Hold the mic for a long time, prepare, beware
I'm comin out with a strong rhyme to terrorize
Every rapper that I paralyze
And if you choose to move then otherwise
Step in the back door, come inside
And join the party</pre>
