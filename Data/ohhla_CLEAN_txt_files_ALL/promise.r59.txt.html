[Sample]
"Why was they leanin' on me? 
Lord I don't 
Lord I don't
I don't know why"

[Chorus]
"People mighty people
Gonna take you to the promised land with me"
This the street radio for unsung heroes
Ridin' in the regal like I'm legal
Com found the new Primo
I got the real Primo
And that ain't my ego
Nigga thats how we do
Teach you (people) 
We true
We responsible for what the police do
DC shoe (people, mighty people)
Other guys cover lies 
We see through
But otherwise we peaceful

Now nigga picture, Malcolm in 76 and
The outfit I stepped in this bitch with
A bitch cause, alpha omega's the mixture
The alpha-
-bet boys flickin' they flicks for
The irrelevant (people) 
Suck my dick bitch
A black man can't be happenin' and rappin'?
Tisk tisk
If perhaps you wanna go against it
I did it my way
You gotta say its eccentric
Mention my name
Aww man
I make a motherfucker fall right where the law stands
Call Japan
Tell him I'ma put him in a deep hole
You gon' land in Bruce Lee hands
It all depends (people)
Talk we can
I'd rather
See you sweat than see you forget
Cause you thought we glanced
Until we see your
Body in chalk
And its doin' that little off beat dance
Haha

[Chorus]
"People mighty people
Gonna take you to the promised land"
This the street radio for unsung heroes
Ridin' in the regal like I'm legal
Com found the new Primo
I got the real Primo
And that ain't my ego
Nigga thats how we do
Teach you (people) 
We true
We responsible for what the police do
DC shoe (people, mighty people)
Other guys cover lies 
We see through
But otherwise we peaceful

[Verse Two]
Wake up America
We ain't where we was
Euro's superior
We think that we love
But we not
We hated
We got created
Off of the slave labor like 'didas and Reeboks
Now peep out my (people) 
Seek I'll destroy him
Or he will destroy me
I don't employ him
Then he will employ me
This is how the fine line cuts in the real world
Kinda like separating sluts from a real girl
My rhymes the most
Niggas the difference is like cyanide to coke
From Witness, the Islam, Christian to just um
Religious
From Nick 9" to sitcom
I'm shoe shine to lip balm (people)
If I'm
Not your leader then leave me the same way you saw me here
Gaudy gear, Mardi Gras flick, Cartier
This time I hope a nigga don't think I'm tryin' to diss Com

[Chorus]
"People mighty people
Gonna take you to the promised land"
This the street radio for unsung heroes
Ridin' in the regal like I'm legal
Com found the new Primo
I got the real Primo
And that ain't my ego
Nigga that's how we do
Teach you (people) 
We true
We responsible for what the police do
DC shoe (people, mighty people)
Other guys cover lies 
We see through
But otherwise we peaceful</pre>
