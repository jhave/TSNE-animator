[Chorus: Pharell/N.O.R.E]
Excuse me.. "excuse me" Let me get by ya! "let me get by ya.."

Phantom windows down so the wind gone blow
On that hang hang gria you should already know that.. I'm a G! I'm a G!
Always live live cause the game gone smell me
Catch me in that drop red car by Chevy
Yea I rep the hood rep the hood getting wealthy
Been through it all there ain't nothing you can tell meee.. I'm a G! I'm a G!
Still on the run but only run from the cops though

[Verse 3: N.O.R.E]
Yo.. now 1 to the 2 to the 3 to the 4
When I sold crack I only sold crack raw
Break it down quick and then I re-up more
When the Jake rush the spot I had the safe in the floor cause.. I'm a G! I'm a G!
I'm still on the block in the benz with the lights on
Cops on the block with they sirens and pythons
Killers don't care bite they ear like Tyson
Gun shots and yelling what you hear when the fight's on cause.. I'm a G! I'm a G!
I stayed right here like I got left back
Always rep Corona, Queens that's Iraq! Yess!

[Chorus: Pharell/N.O.R.E]
Excuse me.. Let me get by ya! "let me get by ya.."
You only in the floor if you a true rider.. "a true rida"
Got no time for no fucking dick riders.. "no dick riders no groopies"
You only on the floor if you a true rider and a.. "haahaaa"
And a G! and a G! "haahaaa" I'm a g! I'm a G! "haahaaa"
