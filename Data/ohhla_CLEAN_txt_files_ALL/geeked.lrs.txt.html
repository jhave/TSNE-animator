Song:   Geeked Out
Typed by: @mc_lars (Horris Records)

This is a song for the geeks of the world
Quincy, can you please pass me that Norton Utilities manual?

Though we once got dissed for our thick frames
Now we get more play than Rick James
2005 baby yo the nerd is back
We're smart, paid, sexy and that's a fact!
Fabio who? That's right, shut up
Can't defrag a Mac while he does push ups
Still don't believe me? Well I hope this helps -
Who's got more gold  Bill Gates or Michael Phelps?
Johnny Quarterback's glory days would never last
He got his girl pregnant and now he's pumping gas!
While the kid he once dissed hung out in his garage
Now he runs Macintosh and his name is Steve Jobs
Not to simplify matters but think about this
A nerd will use his mind, bullies use their fists
Stop hating on us, just because we're smart
Sing along to my song that's a very good start

[CHORUS]
Get your geek on baby, for what it's worth
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
Proud to be a brain (brain A) reverse
'Cause the geek shall in-her-it the Earth

Get your geek on baby, for what it's worth
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
Check check the bass, cosine inverse
'Cause the geek shall in-her-it the Earth

"Oh, I never knew the brain could be so sexy."

Just wait until I show you my Star Wars sheets
We can ride the Millennium Falcon of love

"Oooh MC Lars."

Check it out  here's the story of a kid from California
Fifth grade disgrace I thought I might warn ya
Bionater retainer  dissed by sixth graders
Kids yelled "Nerd!", dark like Darth Vader
"Weird Al" fan, eleven forever
Not the best catcher but computer clever
8th grade online Internet addict
IRC modem Bolo habit, HTML 7th grade website
Jerky Boys fan page, coding all night
GameBoy Advance, Mario Kart, Wesley Willis and outsider art
Writing music plugged in with that Digi MIDI patch
Tweaked-out turn tables learning how to scratch
Couldn't be nerdier, if he tried
'Till he wrote a funky song all about geek pride

[CHORUS]

If you're geeked-out, freak out, speak out
Proud to be a brain? Tell me what's that all about?
If you're geeked-out, freak out, speak out
Proud to be me! Tell me what's that all about?

Don't be afraid of your intelligence. Because that's awesome
Okay? We don't need anyone telling us what's cool
And when they ask the eternal question "Why?", tell them Lars sent you!
