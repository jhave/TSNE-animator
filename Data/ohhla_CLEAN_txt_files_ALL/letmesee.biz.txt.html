[Elephant Man]
Biz Markie and Elephant Man, we sensei
Bump fair ladies like Sean Paul, okay, c'mon!

[Biz Markie]
Ladies and gentlemen, how do you do (a do)
It's been a long time but without further adieu (adieu)
The Diabolical came to get the job done
Cause I'm the, Woogie Boogie and the master of fun
If you're ready to rock, and ready to get down
The grand groovin here to prove a different sound
I gotta get funky for the Y2K
Each and every time I know what to say
East West Midwest and the Dirty South
Always love the way that I be rockin the house
All the ladies, in the new jeans
Like Steve Arrington, you make me weak at the knees
I'm glad to be right here with y'all
Let the players play, and ballers ball, so
Chant, if you like the song
C'mon baby doll just sing along

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Girl, let me see you bounce
Let me see you bounce
Let me see you bounce
Bounce

[Elephant Man]
Every ting be a bounce, make me see girls a bounce
Make me see boots a bounce, make me see party a bounce
Disc jockey be a bounce, raise the stage up and bounce
Hopin dat de club a bounce, if ya irie a bounce
All de funkers a bounce, bartenders a bounce
Soul people a bounce, all dese people a bounce
EVERY TING A BOUNCE, ju know!
Bouncy bouncy bounce bounce, she no care
Bouncy bouncy bounce bounce, anywhere
What kind of booty dat she have {?} in de air
Just a bouncy bouncy bounce bounce, she no care
Bouncy bouncy bounce bounce, anywhere - ju know!
C'mon

[Chorus]

[Biz Markie]
Yes, I'm here to confess
That I took the S off Superman's chest
He got mad cause I felt, Lois Lane's breasts
I asked her could I touch 'em and she said yes
So I guess, that I got the most finesse
Cause I wear {?} Fila, Ecko, Akademic and Guess
When I watch cartoons I watch Johnny Qwest
I wake up in the mornin and shower with Zest
I hope you understand the rhyme I express
And that you know, poppa don't take no mess
You're rockin with the best, so forget the rest
Cause you know that the Biz always pass his tests
Like if I was in high school sittin at a desk
Starin at a teacher, lookin up her dress
You gotta admit that the rhymes are fresh
Right about now I gotta take recess

So uhh, ahh, uhh, ahh
Uhh, ahh, uhh, ahh
Make it sexy, sexy baby
Make it sexy, sexy baby
Make it sexy, sexy baby
So shake it baby just shake it baby
So sexy, sexy baby
Make it sexy, sexy baby
Make it sexy, sezy baby
Just shake it, shake it
Shake it, don't break it
Don't fake it, don't break it
Just shake it, don't break it.. {*fades out*}</pre>
