Bone come break 'em down

Way down, way down

Verse 1: Layzie Bone

I'm taking a swig of the burb word
Downin' my fifth and I swerve
Drunk as I bend on the curb,
Get up to purchase some herbs
To ease up my nerves
While a nigga got rocks to serve
Heard about thugs and hustlas,
But never knew none like us before
We junking them off in dumpsters
Suck these thuggish ruggish nuts,
Peep this cut,
Make a nigga wanna do some dirt,
Puttin' in work gotta hit 'em where it hurts,
Puttin' it down Bone first
And I hit 'em wid the Ouija curse them worse to worst
Dog if you wanting to test Bone,
The con-se-sequences are fatal
Ready be strapped papped wid me sawed off
Clack back cause I believe in me label,
Ruthless, and we steady be puttin' it down
Just for the love of money yeah,
For the love of the wasteland Claire,
For the love that brought me here,
Droppin' piece to the double glock
Ready when the trouble knocks pop pop ya pistol now,
If a nigga wanna run up gun up
Put him on the ground make him lay down stay down,
Harmony smooth wid the thug shit,
Mo murda to the fool that clone,
Five niggas loc'd out wid the roughness,
And it's war tryin' crab these Bones
Bring on ya stretchers ya dearly departed
Ya rest in the coffin for daring to cross this,
Come and get that ass tossed by the boss bitch,
Ain't taking no shorts or no losses

Hook

Verse 2: Krayzie Bone

Nigga come fuck wid me now,
Krayzie that nigga that pump pump
Nigga that's my daily thang
Down wid the bang bang swanging them thangs
It really don't matter man,
Insane to the brain,
My niggas so how could you ever compete with the trigger
Bitch if you decide you want some of this now,
Bite one bid and nigga we're coming to cut ya,
Everyday be the same old
Still gotta flip on the same hoe
Niggas that be tryin' to study the thugs
But nigga back up it's a Bone thing what,
Never taking no shorts or no losses
Creeping up outta me clik see
Mo murda mo murda, and Ouija will be with me,
Creepin' on a come up doing it for the love ah money
Stalking gat fools walking jack moves
Ready to pap you if we have too,
Remember me no surrender
Kill 'em and lay 'em up deep in ah coffin
Me no pretender,
Leatherface taking no shorts or no losses

Hook

Verse 3: Wish Bone

Ain't taking no shorts or no losses tossin'
Niggas all up in them coffins,
They don't know when they run up I gun 'em
Gotta let 'em know who the boss is, see,
Pop pop let 'em drop
Mo Thug them niggas is nothin' but killas
We creepin' we needin' mo money,
We sick and we cold and we hungry, (huh)
I'm loving my thugstas,
My clik consist of nothin' but hustlas,
The nigga you know that'll hurt ya
Serve and murda all bustas now,
Hard times gotta grind get mine,
Even if it means pap that's ya life,
And a nigga gotta die by the sword,
The guage, my nine and my knife,
Cockin' I pump my slugs all up in ya now what,
Shoot a bitch just like a nigga
Ain't no favor trigger you fall,
It's Wish Bone, no shorts gotta get mine,
Yeah it's my time,
Me and my thugs smokin' chokin'
Let a nigga P.O.D, off that wine

Hook

Verse 4: Flesh N Bone

Remember when that dog jumped out of the darkside,
Come creep in the barrel bitch if you test my hood,
It'll be your loss, even if you bring your clik,
Get tossed and it'd do you no good,
Can't fuck wid my gang no thang,
And the bullets they ring out
Strangle the man, and drug 'em up off the Claire,
We strip 'em and beat they brains out,
I gotta give p's to all ah my Trues
Steadily paying them dues
We niggas wid nothing to loose,
Trippin' and sippin' on brews and actin' a fool,
Mo Thug be loving to smoke mo bud, fiend for the green leaves
Nigga quick pull out them trees
I pull out me cheese,
Now gimme now what me need,
Remember me killa cap peeler,
Still a realer nigga,
And I'm on to dig ya,
So bitch if ya run up I'm bound to rip ya,
Me put in me work,
Pullin' me bullets it hurt,
Better run to chalk it
Diggin' ya deep in the dirt, squirt blood,
See the Bone'll take no shorts or losses

Hook

Verse 5: Bizzy Bone

Bone y'all Bone nigga that's startin' some shit up what?
Little Ripster get you cleared up thugs
All ah my muthafuckas show they nuts, and guts
Runnin' up out the cut pumpin' bucks
Ready ta fuck you up must bust them,
And steady be dumping thuggin on the Claire, oh yeah,
Let's smoke out on 88th jumping, wid playas
Whena me forty four let go,
Feelin' the glock glock roll,
95th gunning outta the window
We peeping out the few coming outta the back do'
Hang, on the darkside ride,
Pick up your tec and let fly, why?
I, die, by all ah my, unremorsefullest times on the nine nine
Ride, me killa, gravedigga nigga, coming up out my trench
Rest in peace and runnin' from the holice,
Jumping that barbed wire fence,
Hittin' the pavement dazed, the guage was blazing,
Gotta watch for the po-po raising up up on me
Turn around and face 'em,
Pump pump and fade 'em now.</pre>
