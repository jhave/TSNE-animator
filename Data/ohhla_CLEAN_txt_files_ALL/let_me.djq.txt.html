Good advice
To all the young black brothas
If she don't wanna give it up

Do like Sexy Leroy

See, you gotta leave her alone
If she wanna act like that just

She ain't nuttin, you ain't gainin nuttin
So leave her alone
Because if you leave her alone
Everybody out there just
Leave the bitch alone

So leave her alone
Ha! Leave her alone, leave her alone
Leave the bitch alone
If she aint rippin, leave the bitch alone
Uh ha!</pre>
