Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
When It's Hot
You need another drink
What cha' think
A nigga gonna do
Go outside
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club

[Verse 1]
I see a lot of hoes
They all on my dick
Bunch of player haters want to front for a bitch
If a bitch want to fuck me
Then let her do her thing
Just step the fuck back and let her give me brains
I'm insane like who'm sayin'
It's like I got two brains
See my shoe game
Hate'm shit's butane
Y'all niggas too lame
My bill game like poon tang
Nine niggas on a track like Wu Tang
Shoot like two God from too lame
Big ving-rang niggas at the door like... like... like... you rang?
No need for ID
Walk straight past security they don't search me
Put three numbers in my phone for RS-VIP

[Chorus: x2]
When It's Hot
You need another drink
What cha' think
A nigga gonna do
Go outside
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club

[Verse 2]
On the block (On the block)
And on the street (On the street)
They keep banging
They keep banging them trees
No seeds in my cigarillo
We be blacker than romillo
Tasting like Sugar Hills
Let me pop another pill
Silver eighteen hundred
Kryptonite (Yep yep yep!)
I'm on it
No not superman you can call it x-clan
Black red and green to see
All my bitches eat pussy like missy
But they look like Chrissy
From Three's Company
Roll another blunt for me
Smoke so much weed like I'm trying to live my memory
Like I'm trying to smoke away my mad thoughts
Blunt gave 'em up, a bit too bad go
She wanna hit it (hit it)
And I do too
I ain't talkin' bout the weed bitch
I'm talking 'bout you!

[Chorus: x2]
When It's Hot
You need another drink
What cha' think
A nigga gonna do
Go outside
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club</pre>
