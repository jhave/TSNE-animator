Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uh, uh, yeah
Baby I'm your angel, when you make sweet love to me
Your knight in shining armor, loving you tenderly

Baby I'm you're hero, I save you from bad storms
Loving me so faithful, your love has kept me warm
Never let them hurt, you, they have no right to keep you down
Keep your head up to the sky girl, cause love has come around
I'm an angel of love, I'm an angel of love, for you

I'll be your hot comfy, to keep you warm and nice
You'll be my beautiful baby, no need to fuss and fight
Friends try to separate us, you'll be here by my side
My love for you, I can't hide no no
Your will inside to survive
Baby I'm your angel, when you make sweet love to me
Your knight in shining armor, loving you tenderly

Baby I'm you're hero, I save you from bad storms
Loving me so faithful, your love has kept me warm
Never let them hurt, you, they have no right to keep you down
Keep your head up to the sky girl, cause love has come around
I'm an angel of love, I'm an angel of love, for you

In my life you've been a blessing, like treasures to behold
Love is such a mystery, the future, now unfolds
In your eyes I see the sign, two hearts are intertwined
You've found the best love you could find
A love like yours and mine, yeah
You found out there's love you can find
Baby I'm your angel, when you make sweet love to me
Your knight in shining armor, loving you tenderly

Baby I'm you're hero, I save you from bad storms
Loving you so faithful, your love has kept me more
Never let them hurt, you, they have no right to keep you down
Keep your head up to the sky girl, cause love has come around
I'm an angel of love, I'm an angel of love, for you</pre>
