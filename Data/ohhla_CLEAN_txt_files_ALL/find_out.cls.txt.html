What's Goin On (you gonna find out)
Sooner Or later (you gonna find out)
Are you ready for this (you gonna find out)
Tell 'em who it is (you gonna find out)
I said whats goin on (you gonna find out)
Sooner Or later (you gonna find out)
Are you ready for this (you gonna find out)
Tell 'em who it is (you gonna find out)

[Verse 1]
Put your hands up, man up, look up, find out
Cut thru the rope, nope, not stayin tied down
Gone for a minute, back on the grind now
Thought I was finished? Not Jerry Seinfeld
(whose this) Guess who? Back to stay
Get more use out of Class than a plastic bag
Mom still lookin at me like, act your age
Cause friday and saturday, I wanna get trashed, get blazed
I don't fascinate, I live it, thats it
I even bought a house off of writin rap shit
But don't get it twisted, I ain't that rich
Cause I'm payin off the loan til I'm in a casket
Country boy, move out to the city life
Back to the sticks, wit the family and mini bike
Aint nothin change, spit rhymes, niceness
This games' givin me a mid life crisis

[Chorus]
Either get up, get back, get down, get wit it
Come a little closer now, don't be timid
There's a movement happenin here boy (put 'em up)
There's a movement happenin here boy (put 'em up)
Either get up, get back, get down, get wit it
Come a little closer now, don't be timid
There's a movement happenin here boy (keep 'em up)
There's a movement happenin here boy (keep 'em up)

[Verse 2]
This whole thing failed to amaze me, since the 80s
this hip hop thing basically raised me
And lately, everyones' gun is off safety
What happened to the culture, breakers and the breakbeats
When I was 18, never cared to make green
I write rhymes, turn the stage out into a day dream
And now a day its all changing, guess I'm growing up
Cause I wonder what the fuck are we raising
Used to be a culture, now its all a fissel
Used to flex skills, now we flex biceps
I flip flows you ain't tried yet, make you expect the unexpected
sit, and get your mind set
I'm culture shock, I talk the talk, and I'm a dyin breed thats still tryin to eat
I'm a emcee first (always) business last
Thats prolly why I made no real cash, thats Class

[Chorus]
Either get up, get back, get down, get wit it
Come a little closer now, don't be timid
There's a movement happenin here boy (put 'em up)
There's a movement happenin here boy
I said whats goin on (you gonna find out)
Sooner Or later (you gonna find out)
Are you ready for this
There's a movement happenin here boy
There's a movement happenin here boy

[Verse 3]
Now I don't hate gangster rap, its the one fake jacks
Tryin to glorify it with hopes of making cash
Steal from a culture, and never pay it back
Hate repeatin myself but I gotta state the facts
Most get noted as an entertainment purpose
10 percent don't though, I want to be that person
Wanna sell drugs, hold guns, pimp hoes, buy a blade
Place money, rob people, get dough so..
I know things change, and I'm fine wit it
But now we gettin judged on the crimes we did
Or the dimes we hit, or the lines we sniffed
Shit, we used to get props for the rhymes we spit

[Chorus]
Either get up, get back, get down, get wit it
Come a little closer now, don't be timid
There's a movement happenin here boy (put 'em up)
There's a movement happenin here boy (put 'em up)
Either get up, get back, get down, get wit it
Come a little closer now, don't be timid
There's a movement happenin here boy (keep 'em up)
There's a movement happenin here boy (keep 'em up)
You gonna find out {*repeat 'til fade*}</pre>
