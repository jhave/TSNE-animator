Song:   Night Time
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Quavo]
Night time night, night time night
Night time night, night time night
Bring the goons out, Bring the woolies out
Bring the shooters out, bring the uzis out
Night time night, night time night
Night time night, night time night
Bring the goons out, Bring the shooters out
Bring the woolies out, bring the uzis out

[Verse 1: Quavo]
All my niggas keep that Arma 15 in the club
That's that Mario Chalmers
Bet I pull the roolie
Bet I pull the Uzi
If you run up on me sun that chopper it gon' do you
My niggas don't play soccer, so we don't like to kick it
My niggas play with calculators, numbers, and lil' tickets
My niggas keep the carbon, birds singing just like Marvin
Night time with the wooly find you in the morning

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Offset]
Night night, them goons don't move in daylight
You trying to get hit with the K right?
Them goons gonna shoot for a low price
Aimin' at your potato
Beat a nigga up like I'm Cato
Italian plug named Fredo
All white bricks look like mayo
Lose your life, you gon' lose your life
Pull out that big white chopper with the knife
Cut you up, you look like pizza slice
We don't give a fuck
You can roll the dice, try your luck
Bring them choppers up
Don't think you too big to get touched

[Chorus]</pre>
