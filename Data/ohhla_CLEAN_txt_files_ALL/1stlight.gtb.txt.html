[Scarface]
Step out on my corner with my box of rocks
Drama covers my hood from blocks and blocks
See my homie that I hang with 
Hit him up with the deuce thumb thang shit
back then it came with the love and niggas wasnt trippin over scratch 
Cause we took turns and we both stacked stacks
And if you had a customer you had him for life 
Cause Brad the true hustler granted you right
Cause if you gonna pack leaves then you got to get along
and he who disagrees then got to get him gone
Cause if you start to get paid the niggas wanna flex
and aint no squabbling these days some niggas brought the tech
And when they find you they sending you to immortal ground
and aint no coming back from that shit you going down
Now you history with the quickness cause you was
fuckin up the business
Now what a way to end a friendship shouldve finished
Cause aint no love for pause in this game
Nigga I'm relentless leaving your moms in the pain 
If your ass had to get got then I got your ass
Rude boy mishandled the stock so I popped your ass
I'm so for doe that my mind flows in it for life 
That I'm down to let my mind go get it tonight
No understanding when I'm hustling 
Because in life all I understood was hustling cause I was struggling
Muscling anything in the way 
of me seeing first motherfuckin light of the day

Chorus: repeat 2X

My pockets aint hurting thats for certain 
You see a broke muthafucker it's a burden
I'm the first muthafucker on the block for the cheese
And I'm the last muthafucker to leave

[Bushwick Bill]
There was some niggas selling dope down the street I know 
You make a left they on the right third white house from the liquor store
You can't miss it cause they be cappin 
Pretty cars in the yard
Walkie talkies and security guards
Them muthafuckers had money out the ass and it was evident 
By the way they dressed and flashed 
Meanwhile I'm on the outside looking in
I got to get them mutha fuckers how can I win
Three a.m. coming from the club caught the pussies
Me and four niggas hiding in the bushes
Jumped out like the jumpout boys with them glocks and gauges
(whew) You should've saw them niggas faces
Bitches get butt naked is what I ordered
Open the door get on the floor they was slaughtered
(they was slaughtered)
Cause once inside we didn't need em 
We knew where the scratch was located six months before we raided
And aint feel nothing for their family
Cause in this life you take the bitter with the sweet or your gambling 
Nigga I'm busting anything in the way 
Of me seeing first muthafuckin light of the day

Chorus 2X

[Willie D]
Now you can say what you want about my persona
but don't let me hear you or I'm gon' freak you out like Madonna
Sneak up on put my gat to your stomach squeeze the trigga
So close them eyes cause youse a dead ass nigga
Motherfuckers say I'm wrong because I feel this way
but my environment taught me how to deal this way 
and if I kill this way then thats the way I got to go 
Cause everything you reap in life you got to sow
But I don't care about the paid down the road from a fool 
I'm living for today but if tomorrow comes cool nigga 
If you think you want to meddle with this 
Bring your ass to the square and we can settle this shit
I'm going pop pop pop til your head start swelling
Pop pop pop till your ass start smelling
You cried when your grandma died that was real
But you aint got to cry no more you going to see her
And newcomers get dealt with 
Cause you cant get paid if you aint part of my clique nigga
I'm bustin anything in the way 
of me seeing first muthafuckin light of the day 

Chorus 4X</pre>
