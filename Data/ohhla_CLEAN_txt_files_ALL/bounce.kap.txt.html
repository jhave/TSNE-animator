Big Kap
Flex
Drop a bomb on y'all
Uhh

[Lady Luck]
You can catch Luck in the dice game
Tearin the block up
I don't stop bank I close account stock up
Spend the whole advance and both hands get it rocked up
Street lookin like a track meet when I pop up
How these broads gonna stop Luck
Without glocks up
Run in the club barefooted throwin five shots up
Niggas wanna bounce , tell em bounce , throw your ox up
You just buck oh five and act like you want some

[Jinx Da Juvy]
Ay yo you can catch me in the hood with Papi
Tryin to cop grands
Screw a dirtbike I'm tryin na cop me a land
I'm a gorilla nigga feed me black banannas
Might catch me blacked down with a black bandanna
With the 5th choked out
In a Benz with the rims poked out
Or in a truck with Luck gettin smoked out
I'm tryin not to blast this cat
But y'all hatin on again so I'ma spaz on Funkmaster Flex

CHORUS:
[Jigga's sample and Big Kap]
Bounce
To all my thugs in the club poppin cris
Bounce
To all my fly chicks with they own shit
Bounce
To all my thugs throwin guns on the six
Bounce , bitch , bounce , bitch , bounce , bitch , bounce , bounce
To all my ladies in the club wildin out
Bounce
To all my thugs in the pen bowin out
Bounce
To all my fly chicks stay stylin out

[Jinx Da Juvy]
Ay yo ay yo ay yo
Y'all done let the kid in the game who black out
Y'all done assed out
I'm runnin in the game snatching change on the cash though
Anybody could get it
I dare y'all to act up
I guarntee homicide'll be comin to drag out
Dummies I'm dumpin dum dums on when I clap out
Alotta niggas rap thug but never pull gats out
Shit I'm from the street lay the strip with the jacks out
Who want the coke price whenever I ran up in the crackhouse

[Lady Luck]
I got niggas on my dick and I aint even got one
Flow kind of sick you gotta get cop one
Niggas talk slick only when the cops come
That's when I come through and scrape yo' ass
Uh uh I need ta uh uh milli uh uh's
Extra fu-unds , whole damn crew got gu-uns
How you gon talk crap with clap ru-uns
Claim to be a thug nigga wont't you blast su-um
