[Intro: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yeah! Uh! Yeah! This ya boy Rapper Big Pooh man! Uh!
Buddy Klein in this nigga!!!!!! 9th Wonder in this nigga!!!!!!!!!
Yeah! This that Dream Merchant, Vol. 2 shit, you know what I'm sayin?
I don't think y'all understand what's about to go down man
I don't think y'all really know man, listen

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
That's me your world MC
Yeah I went to college I ain't finished my degree
You can check my pedigree I'm the son of a Lee
It's Pooh Steinback when these words touch beats
Name out on the streets like it's etched in stone
Trust you don't want it when I step in that zone
Faggot niggas call home or they scream for the law
Or they cry for they Pa cause I'm simply Ma
I ain't the type to ever starve I'm a worker nigga
Mention a few mills it do wonders for the figure
Know niggas who would peel you like tangerines
Got government issues like in the marines
I keep my hands clean get tunnel vision
Approach every line with the right precision
Make the right decision 'fore life get missin
And the next time you hear me I be writin different, lil' nigga

[Chorus: Buddy Klein]
Nigga if you dont stand for somethin
You bound to trip and fall down
Man I don't give a fuck click clack hit 'em up
Man we spit heat at these clowns

[Rapper Big Pooh]:
So what you 'gon do when Klein come through
With the Rapper Big Pooh and 9th into
And (AH! AH!) Get at you (AH! AH!) Get at you (AH! AH!) Get at you

[Verse 2: Buddy Klein]
Yo, paddy cake, paddy cake, maker man
You a bitch on his dick, tryna make the band
Get at me dog, I'm funky like nasty draws
Piss me off, I start shootin like basketball
I'm street, I'm hood, I'm really whatcha musta saw
I'm thug, I'm raw, big like I'm above the law
With all this change, I tharted doin a buck in the rain
Flip a ki fool, that's drug dealer's dream
Nigga please, move, I ain't talkin bout crack
I'm talkin bout rap - I eat y'all food right from scratch
The street's my daddy, whatchu gon' teach me, sonny?
Speed on the road of riches, just tryin to increase my money
Carolina beats pah, stop ya breathin dummy
Leak shells in ya back, y'all like Eastern Senate
BK MC, full recline makin cream
(You best to chill..) Or you'll get cut like you ain't make the team


[Chorus: Buddy Klein]
Nigga if you dont stand for somethin
You bound to trip and fall down
Man I don't give a fuck click clack hit 'em up
Man we spit heat at these clowns

[Rapper Big Pooh]:
So what you 'gon do when Klein come through
With the Rapper Big Pooh and 9th into
And (AH! AH!) Get at you (AH! AH!) Get at you (AH! AH!) Get at you

[Outro: Buddy Klein]
Some say it's the shit that we go through
I know sometimes we won't do what we 'sposed to
But all I got is my word and my bond
And I'm a hold both tight until the day that I'm gone

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Some say it's the shit that we go through
I know sometimes we won't do what we 'sposed to
But all I got is my word and my bond
And I'm a hold both tight until the day that I'm gone</pre>
