[Intro: Layzie] + (Thin C)
(Let me smoke wit'cha) Let me smoke wit'cha, let me smoke
Let me smoke wit'cha, let me smoke wit'cha
Let me smoke wit'cha, let me smoke
Blaze it (blaze it) blaze it (blaze it)
Blaze it (blaze it) blaze it
Blaze it (blaze it) blaze it (blaze it)
Blaze it (blaze it) blaze it

[Chorus: Thin C] + (Layzie)
When you're feelin like you're on one, smoke
(Can I smoke wit'cha? Can I smoke wit'cha?)
Sweet ol' mary jane, come and take me home
(Take me home wit'cha, take me home wit'cha)
When you're feelin like you're on one, smoke
(Well let me smoke wit'cha, can I smoke wit'cha?)
Hey, sweet ol' mary jane, come and take me home
(Take me home wit'cha, take me home wit'cha)
When you're feelin like you're on one, smoke
(Let me smoke wit'cha, can I smoke wit'cha?)

[Layzie Bone]
Mary J is my main thang, my main line, every day I wake
Whether blueberry, acapulco gold or that new shit they call purple haze
Help me make it, through my worst days, holidays and birthdays
If I'm down and out and I'm hurtin, I know one thang is for certain
I can roll it up in a cigarello, pack it up in a pipe
I can smoke it up with my niggaros when my girl ain't actin right
But if she cool and, she chillin, I'd rather smoke with her
In the bed or watchin a movie, you know it's next to a cup
And when I call her Mary Jane, she get mad again
Pull out a blunt and once again, now we can laugh again
I'm lovin to smoke it, I'm lovin to smoke it, I gots to get high
'Til the day I die, 'til the day I die even on my own supply
I've been high, since the last song, hustlin gettin my cash on
Twenty sacks don't last long, buy a pound to get my stash on

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke...

Sticky-icky in the system, how we do it, uh
I say "Hey, don't ruin my buzz cuz, I need some fluid"
Where your blunt so I can roll it up like zig-zags, but tobacco
Crazy horse is in the bottle, I'm finna go wacko, yeah
Jamaican spliffs, now roll it, that's that shit
That's that gift, all that I'm gon' need and I'm a {?}
I say yeah, you don't know what I've been through today
I've been workin all night, I need some weed for my brain
And plus some drank up in the cup, what's up? Let's get crunk
Drunk, now I'm tipsy, not flimsy, weeded and pimpin, c'mon
Roll it on up, let's get high, let's get wild, not too tired
On the one, Jesus Christ plus the light, so precise
Roll it on up, let's get high, let's get wild, not too tired
On the one, Jesus Christ plus the light, so precise

[Chorus]

[Outro: Thin C]
When you're feelin like you're on one, smoke
Sweet ol' mary jane, come and take me home
When you're feelin like you're on one, smoke
Hey, sweet ol' mary jane, come and take me home</pre>
