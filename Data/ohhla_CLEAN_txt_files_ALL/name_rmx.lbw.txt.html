Hair nappy but I'm happy pocket full of dough
From the C-O representin' So So
The girls recognize and these {niggas} do too
I'm the flyest thing walkin' through junior high school
So make room next to your little backstreet poster
'Cause Bow Wow's here and it's over! YA HEARD!
I'm this, I'm that, I'm all of the above
In a big body shotgun ridin on dub's
I've been seen with the baddest, heard with the best
And I got it locked down from the East to the West
Look at my eyes, ya know; I ain't playin'
That's why all through the streets
All I hear {niggas} sayin' is

Chorus 2X: [Lil' Bow Wow]
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with me now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
And all my girls around the way that love how it's going down say

Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with me now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
And all the girls around the way that love how it's going down

[Lil' Bow Wow]
Now that the gates wide open
It is I who they runnin' from
Little with the ill, cross over like
Iverson in 2k my way and I'm the first to rock
First to drop ice in the bezel of a G-Shock
Like B.I.G. and Pac, I'm hard to forget
What makes it even worse, I'm just getting started
Yeah that's me; that's got your daughter in a frenzy
Yeah that's me; that's got her arguing with her friends about
Who? Gone, gimme when they see me
Sayin', "Do you?" See him, "Ooh he the man!"
Thirteen, game lock, don't trick
All that and a bag of chips; Hi! My name is,

Chorus 2X

Beware of tha dog screamin', in tha front now
It's-a, must-I, put my stunt down
Who you know my age that spit like me
Step on any stage anywhere and rip like me
Hit the studio with J and make a hit like me
See I am what others cats just might be, dislike me
Only those that's scared of what's trill
I'ma Steven Seagal type {nigga}, I'm "Hard To Kill"
Cash, flashin', girls, that's what I'ma bout
Those that don't believe get stomped out
The game is in a twist now, I'm to blame
But those that don't know, ladies what's my name

Chorus 4X</pre>
