[Big Sean]
Yup, B-I-G
Comin' from a city where bullets turn bros into souls
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hoes
Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals (goals)
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was +Illmatic+
Then I saw Kanye's hangin' from his gold necklace
Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic
Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
Used to pick me up from school, man, right after work (yup)
Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church (SKRRT)
She asked why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first
Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear-view
Used to have to take showers standin' in the mildew
Now I'm in the penthouse, look at what a mil' do
Lookin' in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you

[Chorus: Big Sean]
G-G-Got my first chain
Feelin' like I got my first chain
I be stuntin', stuntin' like I got my first chain
I be stuntin', stuntin' like I got my first chain
BIG was the first one that had it
Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits
I be stuntin', stuntin' like I got my first chain
I be stuntin', stuntin' like I got my first chain

[Nas]
Yeah, what's the noise all about with this rap stuff?
I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up
I can say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up
I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up
Cause it's a mental game; I learned that 
when I got my first initial chain; I didn't fake it, it was gold plated
I was posing relatin' to those dealing with blow
Had the big gold, bold anchors it was those gangsters
That bonus, that culture, those projects
Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint
They got in my bones, now I'm copping stones
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs
18 karat gold Cuban on
Not too short, not too wide, not too long
My pendant offensive, in the truest form
Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?

[Chorus: Big Sean]
G-G-Got my first chain
Feelin' like I got my first chain
I be stuntin', stuntin' like I got my first chain
I be stuntin', stuntin' like I got my first chain
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was +Illmatic+
I be stuntin', stuntin' like I got my first chain
I be stuntin', stuntin' like I got my first chain

[Big Sean]
I'm on a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid
I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved
No matter what way I turn things go my way
I'm rockin' chains everyday, so you know I slave
Even when I'm just walkin' 'round the crib, nigga
To remind me of everything that we did, nigga
Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'
No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flyin'
I know the higher that I go, the harder to climb
But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
Police only work 12-hour shifts
Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch
Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues
FF, GOOD, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews
Stack bills on bills 'til my backyards got pools on pools
Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge
God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D
off this asparagus and bread and pasta; need a doctor
I've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days
It's like I got a built-in doppler
And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame
I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'
But remember my first ass and the first time she came
It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain

[Chorus: Big Sean]
G-G-Got my first chain
Feelin' like I got my first chain
I be stuntin', stuntin' like I got my first chain
I be stuntin', stuntin' like I got my first chain
Jay-Z taught me +Money Ain't a Thing+
Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Kid Cudi]
It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things
Niggas and bitches are with you, cuz where you at?
I got my mind is on me, a couple others and dreams
Would've seen me and my niggas in this bitch
About two months in a week's time
Went from feelin hellish to godly with lemon-lime shine
Now how the fuck can I chill now? Kanye think I'm dope
See this piece that I own now, how sick is the rope?
Takin' life for what it is, the troublesome chick
Who throws fists; sometimes it's the weather
Things switch up, people trip up
The money come down, then climb up, but when it come again?
The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'
Saying that you love me, I surely hope and if you don't
Motherfuck that sometimes, so dead it
Shred it; young nigga lost to the night
I'm so ready to let it go, my life is fuckin' awesome
I could be fuckin' dead right now but I'm awesome
So fuck whoever has a bad thought don't know the god
Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the God
It might be too late, but the songs will live on
Just know this fact, you were all wrong
Now watch me do my silly dance, not really a dance
More like a prance - I'm signing off with a crotch grab

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, willay (hehe) perfect
Thank you man for letting me get on this record, Sean
You the coolest.. GOOD music nigga forever
Understand? Yahm {*harmonizes to the end*}</pre>
