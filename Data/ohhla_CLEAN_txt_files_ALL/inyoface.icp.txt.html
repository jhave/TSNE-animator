IN YO FACE! 

(Violent J) 
I pop out the box, swing on a spring 
Big Violent J with the axe out, SHING! 
Trouble we bring, a juggalo thing 
Wicked clown with the boom pow bang
IN YO' FACE! 

(Shaggy 2 Dope) 
Smash through the glass as the fireworks blast 
Shaggy the clown here to murda some ass 
I be the strangala! known coast to coast 
And I turn any thug into a ghost 
IN YO' FACE! 

(Violent J) 
Some scream juggalo only when it's convenient 
And no they don't mean it 
We sick of being lenient 
Step yo' ass back before the hatchet attacks 
And you catch a few hacks from the axe 
IN YO' FACE!

(Shaggy 2 Dope) 
I crawl like a tarantula on my toes and thumbs 
Born to the carnies gypsies and bums 
I spit my raps in tongues
Over voodoo drums 
Bitch wicked shit this way comes 
IN YO' FACE!

(CHORUS)X2 
For you! 
Something special for you! 
We got you covered homie 
Something exclusive for you 
IN YO FACE! 

(Violent J) 
I was fuckin' this slut up in her dirty ass 
Threw the rubber out the window as we drove past 
Funny thing I see you standin' on the grass 
And it fuckin' stuck to your mustache 
IN YO' FACE!

(Shaggy 2 Dope) 
Bang to the pow, wang to the mouth 
Boom go the wicked clowns southwest style 
From Pluto to your anus, we underground famous 
For doom and 808 bass booms 
IN YO' FACE!

(Violent J) 
I shook the hand of satin wit' a cross in my palm 
Burnt all the flesh all the way up his arm 
I wasn't scared I was giddy to do it 
Then I lopped his head off and threw it 
IN YO' FACE!

(Shaggy 2 Dope) 
Insane Clown Posse never gonna fade 
Helped yo' ass get laid back in 8th grade 
Many years pass and we still top grade 
Blowin' up like a hand grenade 
IN YO' FACE!

(CHORUS) 

(Violent J) 
Billy Bill, JumpSteady, and Nate The Mack 
Down 'til the end 'n' never take it back 
I'd die for the hatchet
The psychopathic records boys bumpin' 
Wicked shit thumpin'
IN YO' FACE!

(Shaggy 2 Dope) 
They all wanna kill us but we already dead 
And if they think we'll ever die they severely mislead 
Phonies out there posin' as juggalos 
But see it as a demographic to push what have it 
IN YO' FACE!

(Violent J) 
Neden- if u ain't down wit' that fuck off 
I like gettin' my dick sucked, jacked off and salad tossed 
Ugly hoes, fine hoes, none go to waste 
But for you, Herpe Meth head anus 
IN YO' FACE!

(Shaggy 2 Dope) 
Mike E. Clark he make the street pound
Legs diamond, all around in surround sound
One fuck up and the other one down,
Fuckin' throwin' up the wicked clown 
IN YO' FACE

(CHORUS)X2</pre>
