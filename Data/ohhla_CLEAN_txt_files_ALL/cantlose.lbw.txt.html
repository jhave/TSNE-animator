[Bow Wow - talking]
Haha, let's go
Uh, yeah, uh, uh, uh, yeah
Ha, I know ya'll can hear that, ha
Just need to holla at ya'll for a minute ya know
Let ya'll know that I'm still here
And I'm gonna always be here
Makin these hits after hits
It ain't gonna stop

[Chorus]
I CAN'T LOSE
I've been in this game for too long
Ya'll ain't gonna take mine
I'm sayin, I CAN'T LOSE
I'm the very best
And I'm gonna be the best for a long time
and I CAN'T LOSE
Ya'll cats just waggin along my tail
Ya'll can't carry my bone
I'm sayin, I CAN'T LOSE
I'm the top dog of 'em all
And you know I'm takin it home

[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
Sony plays me when I'm up at the station
All of a sudden they got me up in Hot's rotation (it's all love)
When I see 'em, yeah I act like I'm they little brother
But I can't get on Source or the XXL cover (please, just once)
That's why I call myself the mayor
Name me one rap cat who sold out Madison Square (Bow Wow)
But Janet, Michael, and a couple of rock acts
that don't know crap about rap
All these little rap cats is here because of me
All them bubblegum raps is about to see
Swing on tour, came up outta the ceiling
Teasin these girls eyes, just what they was feelin
over this little rap villain
And

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]
Yeah, uh, I can't lose, don't matter who I'm facin
The number one under 21 artist in this nation
The rhyme writer, all the young girls like him
Fellas wanna be like him, I got 'em like Pied Piper
Follow my paw print, whatever ya'll print in the magazines is nonsense
Stop all this, yakety yakkin
The fact that nobody rappin
Can stack 'em up to the ceiling
Like 30,000 a building now
You got Jigga, Ja, Nelly, Nas, Eminem, and Kiss
But I represent it for all the kids now
Say that I'm braggin, but no rapper in my age bracket
Is makin it happen the way that I made it happen, now

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Bow Wow]
Yeah, You think it's easy don't ya
Wanna be Weezy don't ya
I'm a performer homie, you just take it easy won't ya
From Nickelodeon shows to BET
I'm approachin the podium, voters votin for me
Cause I keep it real with 'em, everytime I deal with 'em
They +Bounced With Me+ from the start, and I'm still with 'em
I got the keys to cities I never heard of
And every inner city kid got me turned up
With this CD on replay, so the he say, she say don't affect me
No way, I go on day to day
And continue to make money
Make music, make movies
You can never take this from me (nope)

[Chorus]

[Bow Wow - talking]
Aw, there you have it
Ladies and Gentlemen (*laughing*)
Just had to talk to ya'll for a minute ya know
Spit at the fans, spit at the people
You know what I'm sayin?
Let them know what's goin on
But uh, we gonna ride it out like this though
If you know it, sing it with me

I CAN'T LOSE

[Skit]
Bow Wow: I was thinking maybe I come over
         and hang out with you tonight
Girl:    YOUR NOT COMING OVER!
Bow Wow: Ha, if I come over, what you gonna do?
Girl:    No, I'll feed you to the dogs
Bow Wow: Your gonna feed me to the dogs?
         What, I'm coming over anyway
Girl:    You won't
Bow Wow: Yeah, I'm coming over anyways, alright?
Girl:    Okay
Bow Wow: Alright, bye. (*phone hangs up*)</pre>
