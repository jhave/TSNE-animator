"Sooo.. I remember this one birthday, it was actually when I turned 21
 And um.. this boy wanted to take me out and I was like 'Oh, okay'
 He was in the military and stuff so.. it's cute
 And.. he told me we was gonna get tacos, I love tacos
 We was gonna go to San Francisco for it
 So I drive out to meet him and we drive out to San Francisco, it's all good
 And I'm like, 'Oh okay, so where we gonna get tacos?'
 And he's like, 'I just figured we'd just find a place'
 And I was like, 'So you have no plan' So then, he was like,
 'Well, let's go to California Pizza Kitchen' And I'm like, 
 'That's not tacos, like.. you said we were gonna get tacos, where's tacos?'
 So we go to California Pizza Kitchen, it's so.. whatever, like.. okay
 And then he's like, 'Okay, so now we're gonna go out'
 And I'm like, 'What you mean we're goin out??' This nigga takes me to a club
 On my birthday, and I wasn't like prepared for a club, I don't like clubs!
 So we go into this club, it's WILD expensive to be so damn empty
 And it's full of like, Asians, who aren't dancing! And that's it!
 And so, he's tryin to get me to drink all these drinks that I don't want
 cause I already told him I don't drink, so he gets upset
 He's like pissed at me for the rest of the night cause I wasn't drinking
 And so then we leave and he's like leaving me down the block
 In San Francisco in the middle of the night, we get in his car 
 and we're on the freeway driving back and he plays 2Pac - the WHOLE way!
 Like turned all the way up! I guess, to let me know he was upset
 Hehe! I was like 'Are you KIDDING me??!' So that was my 21st birthday"</pre>
