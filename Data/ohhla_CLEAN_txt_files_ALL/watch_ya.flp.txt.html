Uh-uh, yeh yeh, mic check
We watchin' y'all watch us
Pay attention man
Gon' take a while for y'all to catch up
Knaw wha I mean?, know how we do it man
well do it

[Lil' Flip]
Things ain't quite like it used to be
A lot of y'all rappers confusin' me
One day you wanna do a track wid me
The next day y'all thinkin' about jackin' me
I pack my heat my nigga I don't play that shit
If you see me wid a nine I'ma spray that shit
If you reachin' for my chain
I'm reachin' for ya brain
Your Cadillac about to have another red stain
Niggaz know I got a gat wid fifty
I mean I got a fuckin' track wid fifty
Niggaz play, but we don't play
When we, get ass nigga we don't pay
I pray every night, pack K's every night
If the cocaine is tan how the fuck can it be white
We got it whippin' and shippin' we gettin' bread
My nigga we gettin' head like pistols we packin' lead
We'll bust a nigga never ever trust a nigga
You talkin' all sweet I'ma cuss a nigga
I call ya a bitch, I slap ya momma
Nigga I'm vested up, so I'm prepared for the drama
Put yo bitch ass in trauma you layin' up
Hospital bill goin' up and you payin' up
I told ya not to watch Scarface too many times
How you talk shit and wasn't packin' too many nines
Yup, you just watchin' from the sidelines
Pay attention to the books and the guidelines
It's my time, it ain't yo time
I need bread before mic check and show time nigga
These promoters wanna act like they broke
When you fuck wid my money I put my hand on your throat
I slap ya, choke ya, provoke ya, steal ya, kill ya
Bitch nigga I just don't feel ya

[Will Lean]
Yeh, nigga you know what I'm packin'
I seein' ya team homie I know what ya lackin'
I got dollars nigga fuck the cents
I paid cash off the lot now I got trucks to rent nigga
And I'm buckin' ya down, while ya weavin' and bobbin'
and duckin' these rounds
We stay on the road, y'all stuck in the town
Will Lean the chemist nigga I ain't fuckin' around
Uh nigga, and I got the Big Shasta
Double wrong nigga we gotta blast ya woah
Cause I'm keepin' it real
In a six hundred wid jimmy, keepin' the steel
Uh nigga, it's the chemist I'm full fledge
Botany big shot nigga takin' off heads
Leavin' ya for dead when I bust the lead
Hit ya in the front takin' off ya dreads woah, nigga
I'm buckin' these shells a nigga like me ain't gon' be
Stuck in the cell bitch

[Hook]
Everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Niggaz I used to fuck wid
We don't kick it no more
When they heard I got dough
Niggaz started to flock
Niggaz actin' like bitches
So I'm packin' my glock
