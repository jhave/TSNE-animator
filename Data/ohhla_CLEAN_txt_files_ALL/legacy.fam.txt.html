[Timbo King]
The Legacy, get your minds ready, get your rhymes ready

And held a breath of life, resurrect the death of Christ
What you got to sacrifice, I'm on some other shit
Takeover the mothership, brothers get to claim the covenant
Universal lovin it, olive oil you rubbin it
Check the thermometer, ever kilometer
Rise by heat pressure, your thermostat couldn't measure
Royal Familia, atoms bombs from Asquilia
Dark Ages, so read the page, Mike and Alenki
Born on the cross between love and lust
Genisis thru exeuse, larzurus, slash black barnibus
The holy temple be the mental, You and see Islamic
Can you understand the clear picture

[Chorus]
Braveheart, verbal courage, battle the seminar
Royal Fam Legacy, watch us travel far
Positive energy, always corrects errors, Royal Fam rule shit
Now and forever, what

[Timbo King]
Orotorical, niggaz is metaphorical
My editorial breaks down your monuments historical
Geologist studyin land, usin the earth's crust
Measurements, eight elements, atomic weight plus density
Hi-Techs, science, thrustal gravity
Revolve around my oro, I'm the soul that keeps spinnin, what
Supernova, black quasar, my mental radar picks up
Frequencies beyond the earth's equator
Forver glow, electro, magnetic force field
Thoughts build, we bomb for real, Royal Fam still exists
Golden fist, your caught up in the devil's mist
Fire war, royal sire laws, reveal this
Protons, electrons, atoms cause explosions
My center of atraction, I'm the nucleus, you're frozen
My square be complete, architectual, visual
The sound spectrum strikes the mental then the physical
My perimeter damns your diameter
Bar codes are scanned from America to Canada
What, from America to Canada

Get your mind ready

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Get your minds ready, Get your minds ready, Royal Fam Legacy
What, get your minds ready, get your rhymes ready</pre>
