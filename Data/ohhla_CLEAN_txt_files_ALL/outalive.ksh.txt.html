Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm standing on my own two feet
Somewhere hangin' in between
My life and the death of me
Fate doesn't leave us time to waste
Weaving through the human race
Till we run out of air to breathe

But no one's getting out alive!
All the gold on Earth, it won't buy time!
So we might as well give up the fight!
Live it up tonight!

No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!

Life a beautiful and fragile thing
Floating in the galaxy
I'm gonna let it set me free
Now is all we really ever have
Open your eyes and don't look back
Now give me something to believe

'Cause no one's getting out alive!
All the gold on Earth, it won't buy time!
So we might as well give up the fight!
Live it up tonight!

No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!

(Huh, if-, br-br-breathe, huh)

So no one's getting out alive!
All the gold on Earth, it won't buy time!
So we might as well give up the fight!
Live it up tonight!

No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!</pre>
