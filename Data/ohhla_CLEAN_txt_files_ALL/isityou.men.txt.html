[Master P]
My adversaries hate me, this ghetto got me crazy
I hope these streets don't play me, mama why you MADE me?
I'm a No Limit thug nigga
Live the American dream, so society think I'ma drug dealer
Cause I hang with the MADE Men
600 Rolls Royce's and Ferrari's on the PAVEment
Ghetto fabulous, Rolex with the pearl face
Million dollar mansion, imagine livin like Scarface
And then the Feds started watchin me
Johnny Cochran's clockin me
Can't depend on black, not no stoppin me
Started from the bottom, made it to the top
I told you No Limit just came to make the CLUB rock
Get it rowdy (UNNNNGH) get it bout it
Made the cover of The Source when everybody doubted me
and nickname me The Last Don
And everytime I say UNGH (UNNNNNNGH) you gotta press rewind

Chorus: Keva

Deja vu..
You could be the thug that I will do
(That's right baby) Is it you?

[Made Men]
Yo.. feel these Made Men, we blazin, hella ganje, elegante
Watch TV, you can see E, in 3-D, on your TV
Yo E be, thug type, or some nights, we Gucci
Burnin lucci, Dom P, ice rocked out, with a dimepiece
Profusely, spendin lucci, extravagant cuisine
Such arrogance between, the sheets to the extreme
Trips to the Carribean, in a jacuzzi, with a uzi
Try to bruise me, then I coolly, pop pop shots like a juve'
How your crew be?  For the 3/4th, it's Nico, take the meek off
While we floss, hit the weed spot, then freak off, in the sheik long
Got three glocks, niggaz don't want no drama, lyrical Unabomber
Puffin head trauma, ? slugs blastin through your body armor

Chorus: Keva + [Master P]

Deja vu.. [UNNNNNNNNGH]
You could be the thug that I will do
(Ahh.. that's right) Is it you? (Mmm-hmm)
I keep rememberin (mmmMMMM)
I keep rememberin [Made Men and these No Limit Soldiers]
Deja Vu [Made Men and these No Limit Soldiers]
[Made Men and these No Limit Soldiers]

[Mr. GZUS]
Yo, they welcome this Lenox kid
Slicker lyrical gripper number one pick
Yo call me Mr. GZUS, chargin bitches like they Visa's
I ride the blaze skunk, instead of fake funk
Get a taste of this slam dunk
Nigga pops and ya stop junk, my style krunk
Tryin to make all my shit bump
til my pockets got the mumps
Always pray I never have to dump
with the eight-shot, punk you're fucked
You shoulda ducked you bitch
A killer really never have to switch
A-with the real slow pitch that hit
Bass that make your ears split
Cause I know that you're tired of the bullshit counterfeit
so I'm flippin this script up like a lunatic
Better pay attention who you fuckin with
Nigga got the trigger on the 380Z hit it squeeze
Hang around nothin but killers fu'realla
with itchy fingers and homicidal tendencies
Made Men blow your back out til you black out
Trust me, you won't be seein no more, for sure
Fuck around and be face to face with the four-four
Made Men, these niggaz bug more

Chorus: Keva + [Master P]

Deja vu.. (ahhh, mmmmm)
You could be the thug that I will do
(Whatchu want me to do baby?) Is it you? (Uh-huh)
Deja vu.. (yeahh)
Could you be the thug that I want to
(it's hot, uh-huh) Is it true?
I keep rememberin [Made Men and these No Limit Soldiers] [UNGGGGGHH]
I keep rememberin [Made Men and these No Limit Soldiers]
Deja Vu [Made Men and these No Limit Soldiers]
[Made Men and these No Limit Soldiers] [UNGGGGGHH]</pre>
