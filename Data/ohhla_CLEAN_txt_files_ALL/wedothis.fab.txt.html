(Yeah, of course my nigga, I see you)
Like this is where I started from
(Nah nigga I remember, I was watchin!)
I started, takin niggaz beats
and beatin they fuckin beats up, y'knahmean?
(Early~!) Slappin they beats upside the head
Givin niggaz' instrumentals black eyes and shit
That's what I came from, y'know?
(I'm start makin these niggaz call me Papa Dram')
So this ain't, this this ain't really new for me Dram'
But this this the first time I come down here

(Well yeah man, good lookin~!)
Appreciate all the love (I'm gettin it)
Appreciate all my niggaz from the South that show ya boy love
When we come through the town, y'knahmean?
I ain't from the South, I'm a New York nigga
So I come down niggaz show me love
I appreciate the shit greatly nigga
and I show the same love when niggaz come to my town nigga</pre>
