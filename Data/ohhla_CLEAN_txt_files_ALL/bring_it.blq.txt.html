[Natina] (Shamari)
Yo, whoo this is hot, uh-huh
See what I believe
(What ya believe Natina?)
Yeah, I believe that Bring It All To Me
Needs a remix, uh-huh yeah (whoo!) like this
Kick it 'Mari, uh

[Shamari]
I've been trying to figure you out for the longest time (uh-huh)
Everybody claims they don't know you're name (1-9 yeah)
You appear to be someone I've danced with before
And now I shall unmask to reveal your game (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I want you to come (come on)

1  [Brandi]
    Your man fading in and out
    And your man ain't doin' it right
    All you gotta do is say
    Baby bring it all to me

2 - [Blaque]
    And I want you to come
    Dance with me, come and dance with me
    Romance with me (my baby oh yeah)
    Don't be shy
    It's a natural high baby
    And I want you to come
    Dance with me, come and dance with me
    Romance with me (my baby oh yeah)
    Don't be shy
    It's a natural high baby
    And bring it all to me

[Shamari](Natina)
The shadows blocking my place move over right now (towards me)
Don't give me away cause I still wanna know his name, please
(Yo, yo, yeah)
I don't care how long it takes just to know him again (uh-huh)
I just wanna dance the night away
And I want you to come (come on, dance)

3  [Brandi]
    You can't tell me that this joint ain't hot
    I know how to make your body rock
    All you gotta do is say
    Baby bring it all to me

Repeat 2

[Shamari](Natina)
Feel me as I am to you
I just wanna know your name
(Let's make it hot, come on, come on, come on, let's make it hot)
Why do I feel like a fool?
(Everybody in the club make it hot)
I might as well not complain
(Yo, yo, yo, yo, 50!)

[50 Cent](Natina)
Shorty if you really want it
Then you can get it the way you move
Making me wanna hit it, I admit
Got what you said stuck in my head
And I can't forget it
Waking up hearing
(Don't stop get it, get it)
Here go my number girl you can call me (bring!!!)
In the middle of the night if you want me
Listing the paper ain't no wishing baby
I'mma let you ball with me
Just as long as you bring it all to me, come on

[Natina]
Yo, ay yo 1999 stole the spot
Blowin' it up, making it hot
This is how it's going down

[50 Cent] *first line runs with Natina's last line*
This is how it's going down
See us on the yacht or in the drop
Money we making a lot
I bet they wanna know what's next

[Natina](50 Cent)
Yo what's the deal?
Recording the track
50 and Blaque
(Baby you know about that)
Yo while we making y'all dance
Say baby bring it all to me, come on

Repeat 2

Repeat 2 w/ Natina ad-libs

[Natina]
LA I want ya to dance with me
Atlanta I want ya to dance with me
New York I want ya to dance with me
World wide I want ya to dance with me
LA I want ya to dance with me
Atlanta I want ya to dance with me
New York I want ya to dance with me
World wide baby bring it all to me

Repeat 1 &amp; 3

[Natina]
