Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
This aint about me this about you
Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
Cuz this aint about KJ this about you

They said why's this kid on the mic man
He's from Florida he's Christian and he's white man
They said there was nothing in my life man
That I could ever offer except Christ, man
He said now give me everything you got
Ill take that little bit and turn it to a lot
I don't care what they say or even what they thought
I can make a way even when they say there's not
But they said just for me to give up now
They said that I'm a be messed up now
They said there's no way to get love
I was better to drop out or just sell drugs
But he said I got a much better way
If I'd let him in and just let him change
If he got a chance He would take away
Everything from the past so I wanna say is...

Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
This aint about me this about you
Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
Cuz this aint about KJ this about you

They said I had no flow and no show
And no dough it was all no go
All I heard was no no and woah woah
You'll never be nothing man ya need to go home
But he said I got a habit of taking
The least likely and then doing something amazing
And right at the point when he just came in
That's exactly what he did and I aint been the same since
They said now your poor white trash
With a broken home and a broken past
There's no way that your ever gonna last
Even if u did it and you make it then you'll fall apart fast
But he said that I can do anything
Ill take you places that your eyes never seen
Anything you face anything u need
I got it covered if you'll just trust in me

Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
This aint about me this about you
Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
Cuz this aint about me this about you
Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
This aint about me this about you
Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
Cuz this aint about KJ this about you

Now you can just listen to
And follow after them and everything they do
You can just play the fool
And pay attention to what they telling you
Or you can hear what God is saying
Take a look around you can see God changing
Me from the inside out I'm not the same and
I hope it's convincing now I think its so amazing
They'll say that's not possible
They'll get mad and act all hostile
They don't want nothing to do just with the gospel
But that don't mean you gotta let it stop y'all
They call me 5 2 for the reason
The little that I had it was all he was needing
Five loaves and two fishes he was feeding
10000 you finally get the meaning?

Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
This aint about me this about you
Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
Cuz this aint about me this about you
Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
This aint about me this about you
Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
Cuz this aint about KJ this about you</pre>
