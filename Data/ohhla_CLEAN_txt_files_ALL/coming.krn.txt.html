[Intro]
Yeahhhhhhh
D.F.B. bitch! And Korn in this muh'fucker
The collaboration, yeah-yeahhyurrr

[Jonathan Davis] WAIIIIIT! I'm coming undone

[Intro]
I let my shoulders lean, I snap my neck back
I let my wrist pop, I make my fingers snap
First I let my shoulders lean, then I snap my neck back
Then I let my wrist pop, then I make my fingers snap

[repeat 8X over Intro]
Lean wit it, rock wit it!!

[Verse 1] + {Jonathan Davis}
I bounce in the club so the hoes call me Rocky
Posted in the cut, and I'm lookin for a blockhead
Yup in my white tee I break a bitch back
And I keep a big bank, oh I think they like dat {WAIIIIIT!}
'Fore I leave the house I'm slizzerd on the goose
And I'm higher then a plane so a nigga really loose
And I can lean wit it (lean wit it) and I can rock wit it (rock wit it)
And if you gotta friend she gotta suck a cock wit it!

[Chorus: Jonathan Davis]
WAIIIIIT! I'm coming undone
IRAAAATE! I'm coming undone
TOO LATE! I'm coming undone
One look so, strong so delicate

[repeat 8X over Intro]
Lean wit it, rock wit it!!

[Verse 2]
Clean who wanna pop lock from left to right a nigga lean
Vibin to the beat, check my feet, ye' ain't got deez
I rock then bend my knees, everytime the beat drop
Lean wit it, rock wit me, freeze fo' your fingers pop

Pimpin in the club, 'til the hoes start to act up
Cause they see my chain and a nigga throwin them stacks up
I keep a full clip, and my pistol in my pants
I'm in the middle of the flo' they screamin NIGGA DO YA DANCE!!

[J.D.] That's RIIIIIIIIGHT!
[DeFB] Rock wit it, lean wit it, rock wit it, lean wit it
[J.D.] Trigger between my eyes, please STRIIIKE!
[DeFB] Middle of the flo' they screamin nigga
[J.D.] Make it quick now

[Chorus]

[repeat 8X over Intro]
Lean wit it, rock wit it!!

[Verse 3]
Rock left then snap ya fingers, right then snap ya fingers
(HEYYYYY) Lean wit it, rock wit it
Gotta pill pop wit me, go on take a shot
Call me Teddy, I got grahams, don't hate, nigga shop
(Do you MIIIIND)
(I'm trying to hold it together)
(Head is lighter than a feather)
{KORN AND THE MOTHERFUCKIN FRANCHIZE BOYZ}

[Chorus]

[repeat 10X over Intro to end]
Lean wit it, rock wit it!!</pre>
