Yo doctor (hoohoohoohoo), hop out the cadillac
I'm so focused, smoke help my cataracs
Mind on my money, no money on my mind
And I'm looking for Me'shell, and a honey on the grind
Love is packed, I got my honey on the line
So I close my phone, honey know me when I'm lyin'
Cos I be tryin' to get my drink on
Find two freaks tell 'em drink cos Keith home
Murray, block to block we playin' dirty
My ? handle good, I shut the game early (ya head me)
Take two women to the telly
Let the animal out, ring 'em like Barnham Baily (*elephant*)
You can't smell me then I'm guerilla
And I ain't goin' nowhere like Puff and Ben Stiller
It's killer, keep a (uh) on the waistline
Me'shell, drop it when I yell (baseline!)

Got a lot of sense running through ya bones (that's alright), and that's alright

Pull the bar from ya purse, tip start singing my shit with the chorus first (ooh, yeah)

Baby girl got her own thing, she know everybody
High class, mediocre, riff-raff
Love is the root politic

She like to get free, she been to Cuba, she don't watch TV
She only get greedy for the power of the P, uh, and me
Yeah

Like to be in the know where all the major figures at, that's alright

	[Redman] (Me'shell)
Yo, talk to me, yo, walk with me, yo, bounce with me (that's alright, lookie here, uh, lookie here)
