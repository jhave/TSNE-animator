[50 Cent]
This is the Unit
The mighty mighty mighty Unit
This is how we do it
Ayy (ayy, ayy)

I make the airline and pop to it, N.Y. bop to it
No frontin here shorty, niggaz know how I do it
For the paper let the gat pop, jackpot
Find me trippin, ridin slow through the back blocks
Red Coupe switchin lanes, top down, party frame
Diamond rangs, diamond chains, diamonds on e'rythang
Mo' flows, mo' dough, money come, money go
New straps, new clip, stack chips, don't trip
Play playa, go hard, stunt nigga, oh God
Party ain't never over, niggaz hardly ever sober
Different day, same shit, different city, different chick
Show you how I do this shit, you notice how I do it kid

[Tony Yayo]
Bitches recognize when I'm walkin in
Smokin that piff, goin where dolphins swim
44-Colt, that's tossin him
And that four-do' car is what I'm flossin in (YEAH!)
I'm in the black, you in the red
You owe your label money, I'm gettin bread
Can you feel it, feel it? Nothin can save ya
In my purple tag Polo and neon Gators (break it down now!)
Bitch play cute, I don't get upset
'Til her ass get a facial and a washin set
I'm in a private jet, but before the deal
Hoes was like, "He's all right, but he's not ill!"

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You might see me yawnin, four in the mornin
But the party ain't over
Then it's back to the crib, to cut shorty that's how we on it
The party ain't over
Shorty move like you wanna move, work it shorty
Gon' do what you wan' do, twerk it for me
Now get low, shorty work that back
Now get low, yeah just like that
Now get low

[Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, they love it when I pop round, doors up, top down
Seat back, keep that, motherfuckin glock round
Nigga this is my town, my block, my crown
My sound, peace to my niggaz on lockdown
They don't really want that, they know we get it poppin
Six-four droppin, you still window shoppin
I'm ridin round rockin, knockin, Rakim
Slick Rick, Rick James; big stack, big chains
I'm so sicker, the flow liquor, you're broke nigga
I toast wit'cha - if ya got a cup
Hold your fuckin bottle up, I really want a model but
You can get behind the truck, if you swallow nut
I'm just playin, unless you gon' do it
You put your back into it, the rest is all fluid
Don't pull that thing out unless you gon' use it
Ain't nobody bleedin, I guess it's all music

[Young Buck]
Shawty the kush still burnin, Aston Martin wheel turnin
Higher than Mount Vernon, the passenger she German
Bottles is still poppin, clubs is still rockin
Feds is still watchin, but fiends is still shoppin
I got vitamin water money like I signed a deal
How would you feel if you niggaz just got 400 mil' (like me)
My bad bitch do her thang in her Vera Wang
She let me have a brain, I let her wear my chain
I'm on the plane smokin on that Mary Jane
Listenin to Trina while she run game on Lil' Wayne
My Ten-a-ki' timepiece shinin like a light bulb
David Brown t-shirt, dressed just like a thug

[Chorus]
