Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Only thing I know is get them packs in
Don't ever let a nigga think you need him
Fuck a friend be about your business
Stand ten tall and get it
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work

[Verse 1]
When you call a nigga phone and he don't answer for you
That mean that nigga never gave a fuck about you
You're in the streets, don't keep your ID in your wallet
I got like six names, I can be anybody
Early in the morning got the stole rock
Everything I do I see somebody watching
Lost everything I had, the future's what I got
I turn them free bares to millions of dollars
Lesson to adopt, know I'm good, how are you
Do you like my slick, pot no blow my ex by you
Hear the dope phone ain't working in a dump
So anything you want I got it in the trunk

[Chorus]
Only thing I know is get them packs in
Don't ever let a nigga think you need him
Fuck a friend be about your business
Stand ten tall and get it
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work

[Verse 2]
They say crime don't pay when the crime don't pay
Get in line, I'm flying in the sun they shine
Stay low, take time and I'm not gonna do time
Ain't got no time, I'm a rough mine
Don't ask how, I'm a cash cal
I can't wait them cause I need 'em now
So inslack and my pills don't hang 'em
I'm in the shootlane like I'm discharge
I got green, I ain't acting with
I can kill a nigga, I can knock a bitch
And I can't tell when and why, bitch
But I can tell have a break to a whole birthday
That two part, that old shit
Have a nigga ask where hoes quit
Lose a nigga head for a trophy
Then dump a nigga body by the ocean
Finger a bitch with my trigger finger
Same finger that I roll a blunt with
Have to fuck you, I'm here, man
And I paid you, you ain't here for shit
Not a board game, but I really scored
But I made a nigga whole see deep quick
Got a new map with a cooler on it
All you fools got a show on me

[Chorus]
Only thing I know is get them packs in
Don't ever let a nigga think you need him
Fuck a friend be about your business
Stand ten tall and get it
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work

[Verse 3]
You're in the streets and you ain't got it
Then you better take it
Every nigga around me is impatient
Down in Miami I know a couple of haters
Man got in projects that bring stupid crazy
Before the day over, twenty to the eighty
Remix like a cater, I serve you like a waiter
You on the block with no pack, nigga, I see you later
Got dope on flavors, catch me working daily
All I want is paper, D&amp;G, we made it
Gotta go to work, you can't be looking crazy
You trap and don't deserve, if you know how to play it
I had to switch my house, three niggas snitching crazy

[Chorus]
Only thing I know is get them packs in
Don't ever let a nigga think you need him
Fuck a friend be about your business
Stand ten tall and get it
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work</pre>
