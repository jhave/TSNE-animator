[Hook - x2]
I'm digging for some change from behind the couch
I'm jumping in my car and I'm driving south

[Verse 1 - Pressure]
Different seasons come and change, end of winter hibernation
Digging for some change, slept inside the vibes I make
It got me wide-awake and sweat beads are glistening
From lack of air conditioning, to hot to be living in
And as the world turns, I churn my lifeline
The daylight's just a prelude to night time
With no D-Day, you know if I gotta hit this other freeway
Hook up with Baz and PJ, then put the hook on replay
Now we're here for a beach day, let's get it together now
Hit the southern shores before the sun toils and weather fouls
It's where my pals dehydrate, make their speech funny
The sand sheets are lovely, it beats bumping and beach buddies
Keep passing me by, I catch a glimpse in their eye
A moody day under the UV rays in the sky
I keep my feet up to the beat up, damn this is the life
Enough to make a man forget about his worries and strife
In the sunshine...

[Hook - x2]
I'm digging for some change from behind the couch
I'm jumping in my car and I'm driving south

[Verse 2 - Suffa]
Hey I can taste Friday, I'm leaving you guys
I'm chasing a place with sunlight in the skies
So I'm blinding my eyes to the point that they hurt
Only a fool or a jerk would be at school or at work
Days like this are for the beach and brew
I stop off at a phone so I can reach my crew
Hey yo Pressure, what's up? I need to speak to you
The week is through son and what we need to do
Is you, me go get some brews, do thee, coastal cruise
Catch some UV, and bruise, the booty that keeps passing us by
We need to do it while the sun still laughs in the sky
I'll be taking off my Nikes
Feel the sand between my toes, real lives are like
Looking forward to summertime nights
And this is my life, my life, my life, my life
In the sunshine...
