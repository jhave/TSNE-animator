Yesssss...

[Intro 2X: Fabolous]
Nigga the slump is over, we winnin again
Bring some money out homey, we spend again
Wipe the frown off shorty, we grinnin again
Did he say again? Yesssss... we winnin again

[Fabolous]
I'm ridin through the metropolitan, everybody hollerin
Me I'm just acknowledgin, with this million dollar grin
Shine like a halogen, cool as the island wind
I don't judge myself but if I do I'd give my style a ten
Met a chick, who belong, on front of Cosmopolitan
Thick in the right place, otherwise she model thin
She don't do no swallowin, but she got a wilder friend
Who don't give a fuck, I told both of them to follow then
I'm with the familiar, you might be familiar
with a few faces but they still the nine milli-a
They be like the Young Guns, so I guess I'm Billy bruh
I do more than William Bryant, I'm a little Willie-er
Change a little chillier, wrist a little sillier
And I'm grown, so I'm not, really the, kid at all
But I hope you get it y'all, I can't say I did it all
But believe that 'fore I leave it I'ma try to get it all
What I don't get at all, is what these critics call
stuntin, don't mean nuttin, they don't live her like they read it y'all
It ain't the car, it's the way it's kitted y'all
Meanin it's the little things, like the way my fitted fall
The way my posture lean, the way my necklace hang
You should respect this gang, if not expect this bang
But all this wreckless slang, it don't effect us mayne
They build you up to break you down, it's just like Tetris mayne~!
That's why I sex Ms. Thang, and let the next miss hang
And even if I wake up late I do the breakfast thang
That's an important meal, I is the important deal
Jay brought me to Def Jam, feel like it's Jordan deal
I'm young mellow game-winning young fellow
Remember me, I mixed one white with one yellow
Turned nuttin into somethin, you can do it too
This the music that you do it to, 'Lo-so</pre>
