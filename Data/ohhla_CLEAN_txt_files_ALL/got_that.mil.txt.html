[Amil](Beyonce')
Uh, uh-huh
Amil-lion, yeah Roc-a-fella
(Oh, oh yeah)
What? Huh, uh-huh
(Oh)
Yea-yeah, yeah, I got that
Uh-huh, yo, yo

I make cats pay like lay-way
Own like they stole
Deal with late pay and I got that from Hawk
Plus I got my own bread
You ain't gotta wave them over my head
I got that
(I got that)
And you can't leave me stranded
Cause I got a ride back
And besides that
What chick you know cock glocks back?
Eight in the back, they rockin' hot jacks
In high heels, mini skirts and thighs fat
My styles like the international
Pancake house or whatever avenue
I got that, uh I got that

1 - [Beyonce']
    Think I need you cause the rent is due
    You can be outta here baby
    Cause I got it
    I got it, I got it
    Cause cash, coupes, credit cards
    All the exotic things baby
    I got it
    I got it, I got it

[Amil]
Ever since cats found out I ran with the Roc
They wanna take a closer look, wanna examine the box
Magazine want cameras to pop
They catch me in the nude like a Samantha Fox
Listen dude but I got dollars and cents
You don't gotta promise me to pay my rent
I got that
(I got that)
Catch me a drop black playing Speedy Gonzalez
Toes never unpolished
The way I be dressing dudes wanna toss the salad
The way I be dressing got broads acting childish
But I pay my own bills
Amil-lion always has and always will
Y'all got that?

Repeat 1

[Beyonce']
I got that
The house that you live in
I got that
The bed that you sleep in
I got that
The Benz that you're driving
I got that, I got that
I got that
The ice that you're wearing
I got that
So why you complaining
I got that
Who you gaming?
I got that, I got that
I got that

[Amil]
Yo my life's still on
Gas bill caught up
Indian Amil, call me chief running water
Cable still in order
Phone still dials out
Money still long but my patience got shorter
You can leave baby give me everything I bought you
Like you leaving me was some type of torture
I don't need no man to
Do for Amil what Amil can do
You got that?

Repeat 1 (2x)

[Amil]
That's right baby
Amil-lion, uh
I got this what?</pre>
