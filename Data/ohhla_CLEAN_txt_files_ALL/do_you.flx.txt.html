[Intro]
That "T" would help though
Here we go again
Yeah, check it out, y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check it out y'all, check it out y'all
Straight Y.O. mother fuckers

Now days cats and middleman, little man, ain't controlling shit
Talk about holding bricks, but ain't holding dick
Niggas talk real slick, but that's about it
Soon as I see 'em headed my way, I cut them off quick
Must you beat me in my head everytime I come through?
It's shit like, everybody tells me I sound just like you
But you not me, got me? And you can live without me
If I wasn't DMX, you wouldn't give a fuck about me
Ain't about "Dog I wanna be just like you"
How about you wanting to be just like you?
You can do what I do, just in your own way
Shit, I get niggas that ride big every fuckin' day (I-ight?)
If you got talent, talent is yours, it can't be mine
And it take you where it's gon' take you, it'll be fine
Let me hit 'em with the rewind
Do you and I'll do me
To me you'll see how real you'll be

1 - 	Do you - Cuz what it boils down to it's true
	Do you - Cuz you are held accountable fo ryou
	Do you - Is that really what you want me to see
	Do you - Cuz I'mma do me, truley

	Do you - Cuz what it boils down to, it's true
	Do you - Cuz you are held accountable for you
	Do you - Is that really what you want me to see
	Do you - Cuz I'mma do me, truley

Hey yo dog, I got lyrics
Hey yo dog, I got beats (Word)
Damn, is this the type of shit I gots to put up with in the streets?
Used to be able to walk, not have to talk to nobody
Everywhere I go it's like I bring the whole party
It ain't about tryin' to follow or tryin' to be like
But if we all see it through the eyes of the Lord, we see a light (c'mon)
Just let me get a hold of the mic, I'll teach you a little something
Now the good things that go wrong because of a little frontin'
Express yourselves, be who you are, umm umm, you're a shining star
You don't even know what you got inside
How the fuck you gon' find out, you keep wanting to ride
Hey yo, I ain't gon' let it slide no more
You're best to go for what you know
Can't do you, then what you flow for
You ain't gon' get there tryin' to be me, dog
Look through your eyes, see what you see

Repeat 1

Like fuck it, you wanna be me? Here's what you do
Grow up neglected by both parents and still pull through
You gots to come up fucked up, get treated like shit
Then have your mother's new boyfriend smack you like a bitch
Turn into a killer, don't carry shottie
Cuz the way it's goin' down right now, you gon' kill somebody
Get a dog, walk the streets, learn what you need to learn
Better have a cause but because you'll get burned
You got 15 years without ever coming out
And beat your fist at the world and what they talkin' about
Then get locked up every two years
For two years keep it real, hold back all tears, face your fears
Become a man before your time, rap but live out your rhymes
Let 'em know what's on your mind, then you'll get your shine
In time, everything you hear will come true
But you won't be doin' me, you'll be doin' you

Repeat 1 until fade</pre>
