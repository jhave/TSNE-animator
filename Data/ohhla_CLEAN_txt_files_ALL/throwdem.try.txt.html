[Dude talking]

Everybody get in line
Ain't nobody getting in the club,
Unless you get in line
It's to crowded in here

Hook: 8x

When they hating throw dem bows
(Get 'em off, get 'em off)
Throw dem bows

Verse 1:

Niggas throwing boes
Firing up dem dubs
Everybody cool
Chilling in the club
Smoking on some what
Got me on lean
I be in the cut
Blowing mad green
Flexing at the bar
Dubs on my car
Limousine chauffeur
Face in magazines
Pull up on the scene
Cause I'm riding clean
Might be in a Jag
Might be in a Benz
Might be in a Chevy with some duels ack a ass ack a ass
Quick to pop a slug at a nigga
Take a plug out a nigga
Got a nigga ??? dome
Dirty South affiliated niggas tout tones
Them there make a nigga get gone
Niggas throwing boes trying to get up in the do'

Verse 2: Mica B

Here I go
When I come to the do niggas fall to the flo
Cause I be throwing them boes
I'm the realest ho
Bucking all my foes
U understand ho
Thuggin' bitches and lovin' niggas that's bout that change
Pimping niggas and putting bitches up on some game
When I'm in the club
Bitches don't you fuck with me
Nigga don't be touching me
Cause I'm fucked up
And if you walk up get slugged up
Stepping on bitches toes
Spilling drank on they new clothes
Muthafuck dem hoes
Got money to blow
Plus I got a chip on my shoulder
Y'all don't wanna get bowed up
Y'all niggas don't wanna fuck wit me
Y'all playing
We throwing dem boes
So back up off me
Ha, what 3x
We throw dem boes on dem hoes
Y'all niggas ain't ready
