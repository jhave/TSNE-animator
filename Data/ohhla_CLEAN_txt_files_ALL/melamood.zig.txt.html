Song:   Melancholy Mood
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

A little collie weed to ease I grief
Too much agony living in the limits of big city
A little collie weed to meditate
Too much insanity in this society

Melancholy mood I eat for my food melancholy mood

Rise this morning smile with the sun
Oh I'm blessed another day has begun
Everything in life has its purpose
Find its reason it has its season

Melancholy mood I eat for my food melancholy mood

Tears leave my eyes I just want to fly
Deep down I feel pain
But I know I must rise again

From this melancholy mood melancholy mood
Melancholy mood I eat for my food melancholy mood</pre>
