So many ways, you can spray, git hit
With tha' K, anyday, ain't gon' motherfuckin' say (Aye, Aye!!)
Dat you might git touched
Cuz 'em gangsta ass niggaz, they don't talk too much
Come around, fuck with me, and then you might git rushed
Nawh, I ain't with the yappin', but I make the gat go bust
Keep fuckin' with us, we off the danger-ous
Show you the meanin' of Ash 2 Ash, is just a Dust
If you laid back in the 'Lac
I dunno if them hatas gon' handle dat
Keep my motherfuckin' hand on my fuckin' gat
Aye, yall motherfuckers betta git back
Yea, all the young ladies call me +Get It Mayn'+

You can see the phat stacks off, in my pants

[Verse 2 - Young Buck]
You thank you a killa, but we gon' just pay 'em a visit
Put the potato on the barrel, so no body hear it
I keep a holsta on my shoulda like I'm John Wayne
Shootin' these niggaz lights out like Lebron James
Holla my name, gimme a reason to see you bleedin'
Afta you feel these hollo' tips, nigga - then we eatin'
Full of anger until there's no mo' bullets in the chamber
Ain't nothang like when you git popped and don't know who to blame-a
Nigga told me, "Do ya durrt all by your lonely"
So I go hit 'em niggaz 'fore 50 couldn't even hold me
I'm waitin', anticipatin' to put a nigga unda
Smokin' like we some Jamaicans fuckin' with this ganja
Ride with no hesitation, retaliation is a must
Bad as I want to, some shit I just don't discuss
So point 'em out and watch how I knock him off
Err'where you bitches go - I got a nigga watchin' yall, motherfuckers!

[Chorus w/ Lil Jon ad-libs]
I'm a (Gangsta gangsta), 2-4-5
Gotta charga on the boost, baby girl you wann' ride?
Wit a (Gangsta gangsta), Aye!
Yea dat's me, tinted out ridin' durrty - comin' down ya street
I'm a (Gangsta gangsta), Git triggas squeez'd up!
Got fitty killas with me, Strap'd down - G's up!!
Cuz I'm a (Gangsta gangsta), Yea top of the list
BME motherfucker - Git cha mind right bitch!

[Verse 3 - B.G.]
It ain't easy livin' where the young die fast (Fast)
It's eitha rap, or take a penitentiary chance (Chance)
This rap shit too easy fo' me to go back
Ten fo' a piece of crack, fifty to rap on a track
But I ain't lyin', the streets call sometime
I could go to Detroit, sell 'em a thousand a pound
And git 'em fo' bout two-hunned in H-Town
Fo'git it, I ain't even goin' dat route (Fuck it)
I just do it like I do it, cuz the streets love it (Love it)
I hold it down, neva bow, gotta stay thuggin'
I don't be trippin' when the hatas go to mean-muggin' (Muggin')
I keep a strap in the hand so I keep stuntin' (Stuntin')
Now it's known by the whole world who a joke (Joke)
He ain't a man - got dreads, you already know (Wayne)
All my gangstas, gon' put ya hands up (Put 'em up)
And all my hott gurls, back dat azz up

[Chorus w/ Lil Jon ad-libs]
I'm a (Gangsta gangsta), 2-4-5
Gotta charga on the boost, baby girl you wann' ride?
Wit a (Gangsta gangsta), Aye!
Yea dat's me, tinted out ridin' durrty - comin' down ya street
I'm a (Gangsta gangsta), Git triggas squeez'd up!
Got fitty killas with me, Strap'd down - G's up!!
Cuz I'm a (Gangsta gangsta), Yea top of the list
Guerilla Unit motherfucker - Git cha mind right bitch!</pre>
