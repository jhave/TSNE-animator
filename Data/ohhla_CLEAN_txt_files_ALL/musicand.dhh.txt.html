Song:   Music and Politics
Typed by: illblader@net.hr

If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
I would tel you that sometimes it's easier to desire
And pursue the attention and admiration of 100 strangers
Than it is to accept the love and loyalty
Of those closest to me

And I would tell you that sometimes
I prefer to look at myself
Through someone elses eyes
Eyes that aren't clouded with the tears of knowing
What an asshole I can be, as yours are

If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
I might be able to listen in silence to your concerns
Rather than hearing everything as an accusation
Or an indictment against me

I would tell you that sometimes
I use sex to avoid communication
It's the best escape when we're down on our luck
But I can express more emotions than laughter, anger
And let's fuck

If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics

If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
I would tell you that I pooped in my own dog dish
And sometimes I would rather face not eating
Than face licking it clean
And admitting when I'm selfish
And I'd tell you that I'm suffering
From the worst type of loneliness
The loneliness of being misunderstood
Or more poignantly
The loneliness of being afraid
To allow myself to be understood

If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
I would tell you that the personal revolution
Is far more difficult
And is the first step in any revolution

If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics

I would tell you that music is the expression of emotion
And that politics is merely the decoy of perception</pre>
