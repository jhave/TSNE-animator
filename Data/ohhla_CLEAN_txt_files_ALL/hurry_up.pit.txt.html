Hee's baaacckk!!
To rip on this  track, I'll rip any broad
I don't care, white or black!
Hee's baaacckk!
If Pit's on the job, then there's no need to worry
Dog just hurry up and wait
Cuz I ain't Going no where anytime soon
Sick what these rappers wanna be?
That's me, times 2
Now...
Get ready for me to take over this game
I'm cutting the flow, like I'm cutting the cane
Things will never be the same

There's a lick for 50 bricks

Then pause... pause...
FUCK YEAH!!!
I'm ready to go, jump in the ride
Get the mask, get the gloves
Cut off the lights, pop the gat
Run inside, fire'em up or tie'em up
But don't forget to pick up the prize
And upgrade the ??
If they don't give up the pies
Now...
I would hate to have to calm these boys down

[Chorus 2x]
y'all want my spot?! Hurry up and wait!
y'all want me to stop?! Hurry up and wait!
y'all want me shot?! Hurry up and wait!
y'all hurry up and wait! y'all hurry up and wait!

I've been brought up
By street cats who didn't get caught up
Like that New Jack Nino Brown at the Carter
I'm the new Tony Montana, only I'm just a
