Chorus: Onyx (repeat 2X)

(Onyx, Onyx..) Move back .. the Onyx is here!
Back up, back up .. the Onyx is here!

[Fredro Starr]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah make way for the wild child!
Stop screamin, you're fiendin
Play that, say that, dip dive socialize
Uncivilized guys RISE UP!
And pop wasn't ready the way they say this cause we hate it
Back up, back off, lick shot for that tree spot
Onyx is the antidote for all your problems (yeah, yeah)
Damn!  Don't it feel good

[Sonee Seeza/Sonsee]
Yo, I know you love to hate it, but you cannot explain
Why you keep puttin Mad Face in your veins
Oooh, yeah, there, I got it
Afficial Nastee psychotic..

[Fredro Starr]
.. spies got spotted!
So travel through the mind of a maniac automatic
You panic get deaded, a nigga on the planet

[Sonee Seeza/Sonsee]
Feel the black stone, hit the do', roamin the ??????cal
Fills and skills to put chills in ya backbone

Chorus 2X

[Big DS]
1-to-the-9-to-the-9-to-the-3, solid as a rock!
So back up off the block, blow up the spot
So left-right-left-right
Take it to the center, and enter
(The black reign domain, a plain you never been to)
And you know what this is (what?) Face down on the floor
Give me it all, I got they back against the wall.. {*echoes*}

Chorus 2X

[Sticky Fingaz]
Don't be afraid, you'll only lose your life that way
I'm an endangered species, surprised to live to see today
but if you're readin between the enemy line you'll find I'm insane
Too much strain on the brain, capable to pop a vein
So I'ma do-it do-it do-it do-it do it like this
The Onyx is here, so back up or get dissed
And if you put me to the test, I'll lay you to rest
Bring it right to his chest, put it straight through his vest

Chorus 2.5X

Back, UP!!!  Onyx is here..
