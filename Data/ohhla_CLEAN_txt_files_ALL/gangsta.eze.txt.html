Verse 1: [Gangsta Dresta]

I got beat for the street
Ta pump in ya jeep
Or in ya caravan wid da homies kinda deep
Somking on a thai stick feeling kinda hight wit
Ya passenger seat occupied by a fly bitch
Rolling in ya lo-lo
Cut list all ya MCs
Slap in the hip-hop
Ta hell wit the ?tempres?
Modern day gangsta from the underground
Yay, niggas roll around wid tha boomin' ass sound
Got the 6-4 kinda low as we bouncing
On the grapevine rolling deep to Magic Mountain
Hoes on ya jock everytime ya hit a corner
Because ya rolling twisted on the gold Daytonas
Frontin' on the regular, talking on ya cellular
Acting like ya don't hear the little bitches
Yelling ya name at the bus stop ya don't stop
Ya mash on the gas roll right by they ass
Slap Dresta in the dash yeah,

Hook:

Guranteed to hear something sweet uh,
Gangsta Beat 4 Tha Street
Guranteed to hear something sweet yeah,
Gangsta Beat 4 Tha Streetz

Verse 2: [Sylk]

I got beat for the street
Drop a rag top four
Got my strap under the seat just in case
I have ta check a hoe
?Menage a trois? on the scene
Rolling through the C-P-T
Turn up the hump soundz
We grooving to the mellow beat
Mad dogging like bitches
Hitting me up like I'ma banger
Cause niggas can't stand ta see us
Sitting on some danas
When we came up all of tha fools
Running drag thinking ya gone 'n
Put tha twist I ain't tweaking
Drop ya putting the lock on it yeah!

Hook

Verse 3: [B.G. KnoccOut]

Beat for tha street
I love ta hear it pumpin in my lo-lo
Hitting my switches and running tha bitches
And now I'm bustin' mo hoes
Roll up to tha spot
Me hop out and hit tha chirp-chirp
Bail in put on some proper shorts and a proper shirt
Just clowning cause hoes are in the house
Riding my dick because I got fame,
And my name is B.G. KnoccOut
Asking ta be in my next vide-o
Get tha 7 digits slap that ass
And step to ya hoe
Now I'm off like a G flee to the C-P-T
See my niggas on the block getting tipsy
I pulled up and start tearing up the street
And guess what's in my muthaphukkin' deck,
Gangsta Beat 4 Tha Street

Hook

Verse 4: [Eazy-E]

I got beat for the street
To tha beach I'll be rolling
Neva see me strolling
40s I'll be holding
Girls in the daisies
Drive Eazy crazy
Rolled up my windows
As I turned on my A-C
Rolling down Crenshaw see tha hoes jocking
Sunday nights popping
See tha foes hopping
My stereo's bump
And that A-T-L funk
You can call it what ya want
Either way the shit bumps
(Damn Right!)

Being a gangsta is so neat yeah,
Gangsta Beat 4 Tha Street
Being a gangsta is so neat yeah,
Gangsta Beat 4 Tha Street
Being a gangsta is so neat yeah,
Gangsta Beat 4 Tha Street
Being a gangsta is so neat yeah,
Gangsta Beat 4 Tha Street</pre>
