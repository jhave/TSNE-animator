* - doing Run-D.M.C.'s "Together Forever (Live at Hollis Park '84)"]

[Redman] * (Posdnuos)
Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get your ass up, and let's get ill 
(Aiyyo get ya ass up and let's get ill!) {"Hold it now!"}
That's right y'all, we more than rough, we callin your bluff
And when it comes to rhymes... (Brick City)

[Pos]
Yo, don't scandalize mine
I spent too much time
Straight talk with the catch to etch my line walk
Fetchin for crime, halt!  Who goes there?

[Dove]
Yo, it's the squeeze of five fingers, puffin Smokey the Bear
Shinin black like Darth Vader caps, they on stare

[Pos]
While we rockin it, I'll rock in it
Like the little ball inside the spray can
Providing three coats for both child, woman and man

Chorus One: Dave, Pos

God bless them all, lay these Streets Wall to Wall
We go - oooh, {OWW!}, {"World...Famous"}
Yo, you got popped like a flick by that rivalry click
It went - {Oh my gosh...}

[Pos]
It ain't my fault your ass is on the asphalt
Got your chin touched by my fam who though you brought harm, you see
We outted out like a glass of tea
Better yet, oatmeal cooks, y'all just ROOKS to me
Slidin' up and down the court, but I don't think you can D
Why try?  Maseo been sky high since Luke was Luke Skywalk'
My topic of talk is sheddin shame all over your game
It's life~! Afrocentric lovin was the past drug
A life filled with (*WOO*) that's what thug's love
Shoot fast, ass  
Drug of your choice man, it muffles your voice, man

[Dove]
Now when I'm swimmin through the joint, I put the funk on hold
If you don't, you'll see the bubbles come up
We run up a tab and gladly add a little extra for miss
Flashy faces with bigger lips for that ass to kiss

[Pos]
Most crews are post-current while we're forever
Direct beats that's contagious, (loved by all ages!)
Graduated from the you-and-I-versity
of hard-hitters, for real

Chorus Two: Dave, Pos

I got peoples in the streets that'll blast your ass for this beat
And go - oooh, {OWW!} {"Yo, that's fat!"}
Yo, if you a big girl gettin your love between sheets
Go - oooh, {oooh!}
Put your hands opposite to the ground if you're lovin our sound
And go - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooooooh!

{"How do I work this??"}
Uh, Marvin? {"Ooooh!"}</pre>
