We love it in the palace when we smokin' off the chalice
Quiet as a mouse on the couch we sit
Fillin' the pouch eatin' sour patch kids

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya'll
Searchin' for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin' lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Thirty-eight strands we through em on the table
Sampled em all one by one I was able
They all taste good, defeated to smoke
Next the two footer, I wanted to choke

First morning over seas I'm up a quarter to seven
Wakin' up on a boat a floatin' tokers' heaven
I head to the future to where I got the future roller
A hash ???? with a special loader
Hey yo, roll up the chiva, the paper the comb
Insert the filter, head rush, mind blown
I call it bluff if the herb ain't quality
I'm hunting for the dankiest buds in the country
Well I dismissed all rookies with the keyfast cookies
And I head to redlight just to get a little lookie
Hit the green house, too crowded
Just checked out the entry
Smoked so much weed I got the highest in the century

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya'll
Searchin' for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin' lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya'll
Searchin' for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin' lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

I'm in the mellow yellow, hello, hello
Smokin' double purple just me an my girl
Richter shows up ready to puff
We start smokin' snuff, don't bluff no more skunk
The PT Bump? the last of the bunch
The dirty dirty smoke, we all passed the hump
I'm all up in my high so I played a little pinball
Gave my girl a kiss we jump like pitfall
Ding ding to another level
Higher, getting higher, we sat down at the table
Breakin' up strands got mad amounts of herbs
Observe my headache kid i was high as a blimp kid
Now I'm Johnny Richter never say that I'm done
Smokin' vaps all day I got that golden lung
Blunts and backs? 40 sacks ??? pipe to his bong
I even saw a po po puff a bowl from a gun

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya'll
Searchin' for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin' lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya'll
Searchin' for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin' lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Why does everybody keep on planting bud seeds
It's obvious to me that it's fulfilling some need
A plant is a power like a human is a being
Put the seed in fertile soil then continue to feed
Whoa! Sit back and watch it grow
The miracle of life is so beautiful
Don't ever let them tell you mother nature is a bitch
Love and restrict only benefit the rich

Loaded with hash eight-teen is the winner
You get the picture I started to shiver
I'm as high as can be with my girl and weed
I'm insistology overseas stay high
John Rastafari handles my business
Licorice sticks at a flick of the wrist
Coffee Shop stop but some mocha and some crop
Amsterdam where they legalize pot
Yo Coffee Shop stop this daze my last strange
Slapped on my shades as I step into the rain
Try to regain up your ??? and refrain
Johnny Richter's playin' games
High as fuck ridin' trains took a plane to the cup ??? cannabis
You know it got me so lit I forgot what song is this
I'll never miss another year you know I wish you were here
Heinekens all day and grips of krypt with my beer

I'm on a paid vacation
Smokin' purple silver hazin'
The back of the cad '82, rippin' out the pap
The herb makes me wiser and quality taste smoked out the whole place

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya'll
Searchin' for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin' lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya'll
Searchin' for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin' lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya'll
Searchin' for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin' lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya'll
Searchin' for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin' lovely
Amsterdam a place called home</pre>
