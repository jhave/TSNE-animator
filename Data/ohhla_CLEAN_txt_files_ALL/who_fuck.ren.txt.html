[MJG]
A natural fact:
That I pimp tracks and freak around
The game got cracks in them pipes,
it's leakin' town
My lines blow yo' mind,
yo' senses remain puzzled
Attacked by the weight of the bass
in yo' chest,
Eightball, MJG, MC Ren,
nevertheless
'Cause we's the most
My real-ass lizards,
let's make a toast,
and sing aloud to bustas,
and force 'em to get ghost
And coast to coast
We shows loves in Network,
while some try to impress people
and get hurt.
Deep thoughts cloud my conscience
as I curl,
up in the corner on hand,
and then I hurl
Call my girl
Tell her I'm drunk 
and can't make it
I tried to drink the whole damn bar
and couldn't take it
That's aiight!
'Cause come sunrise,
I'm still rollin
My nuts the only title I'm claimin'
and still holdin'

[Chorus- MC Ren]
Now who in the fuck
wanna come and represent?
You bitch ass niggaz,
y'all be too hesitant
I, take my black ass 
down to the south
Bitches wanna fuck me
while I'm in the Suave House

Nigga, who in the fuck
wanna come and represent?
Oh, I know you suck that dick,
acting too hesitant
We, MJG, Eightball, Villain,
Make that straight nigga shit,
that's how these niggaz feelin', Uh.

[Eightball]
Guess wo popped up,
straight up out the cuts
with lyrical buckshots
spillin' all a nigga guts
Touch whoever witness,
strays when I displays,
a thousand different ways to get paid
with a phrase
Days go by,
I be hibernatin' gettin' high
Dreamin' 'bout L.A.
penetratin' somethin' fly
Down in H-Town,
or somewhere in the Mound,
all eyes on me, baby,
'cause I get around
We be like, connected
weak-ass niggaz get ejected
Ooze like slime,
dig this hines when we wreck shit
Uncut, coast to coast,
slangin' audio dope
Manglin' MCs, leavin' 'em,
danglin' from ropes
Boast, tryin' to be doper than most,
in my profession
Me and the villain, microphone killin'
no blood spillin'
Phat raps with much cheddar
in the tellers,
Eightball and MJG and MC Ren,
Foreva!

*Chorus*

[MC Ren]
Fuck that, bitches, the villain be
out in Houston, Tex.,
To fuck with them niggaz from Suave
who wanna flex.
Bitch niggaz got kidnapped,
with dicks in they mouth,
fo' fuckin' Compton niggaz, and
niggaz from down South,
Eightball, MJG, where you at,
space agent?
Y'all prob'ly got all the bitches pagin'
suckin' 'casian.
Writin' left nuts,
chapstick and lips,
While bitch-ass niggaz spendin' chips,
just to see the hips
South-West connection,
bitches bow tha fuck down
Fuck how them other niggaz sound
Villain be hated by niggaz because
they bitches pussies throb
ready to slap that ho,
every time a head bob, niggaz be killin' me,
Got that nigga T-Mixx,
pull the fuckin' remix
if these words don't hurt you,
nigga, got them stones and sticks,
and some Compton-ass niggaz
to make you fade to black
With some crazy Houston niggaz
in the cut in the back

*chorus*
fade to end</pre>
