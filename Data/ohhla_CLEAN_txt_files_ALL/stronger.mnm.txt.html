[Eminem - singing]
You used to say, that I'd, never be
nothin without you, and I, believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby hold, me please
And I'd beg, and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry, and I'd scream, "Baby please don't leave!"
Snatch the keys, from your hand, I would squeeze
and you'd laugh, and you'd tease, you're just fuckin with me
And you must hate me; why do you date me
if you say I make you siiiiick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the eeeeedge

[Chorus: Eminem - singing]
But you won't break me, you'll just make me, stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just - FINE without you!
And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up, and UHHH
But I'ma still be humble, when I scream fuck you cause I'm stronger than I waaaaas

[Eminem - singing]
A beautiful face, is all, that you have
Cause on the inside you're, ug-ly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby hold, me please
And I'd beg, and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry, and I'd scream, "Baby please don't leave!"
But you left, and you took, everything
I had left, and left nothin, nothin for me
So please don't wake me, from this dream baby
We're still together in my heeeeead
And you're still in love with me
'til I woke up to discover that that dream was deeeeead

[Chorus]

[Eminem - rapping]
You walked out... I almost died
It was almost a homicide that you caused cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride, I'd rather die than you not by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried, go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde, nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde, I felt like my
whole relationship with you was a lie, it was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
Cause if you coulda, took my life you woulda, it's like you put a
knife through my chest and pushed it right through to the, other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
put up more of a fight but I couldn't at the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that? Bite me bitch, chew on a nineteen-footer
Cause this morning I finally stood up, held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
first time since you left and left me with nothin but shattered dreams and the life we coulda
had and what coulda been, but I'm breakin out of this slump I'm in
Pullin myself out of the dumps once again, I'm gettin up once and for all, fuck this shit!
I'ma be late for the pity party, but you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ, so don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done being your punchin bag, it was November 31st today
Would've been our anniversary, two years but you left on the first of May
I wrote it on a calender, was gonna call but couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay

[singing]
And I thank you (uhh) cause you made me (uhh) a better person than I was
But I hate you (uhh) cause you drained me (uhh) I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me (uhh) you're crazy (uhh) and after all that's said and done
I'm still angry, yeah I may be, I may never trust someooooone

[Chorus]
