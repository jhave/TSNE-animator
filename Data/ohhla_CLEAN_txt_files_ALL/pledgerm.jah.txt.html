[Ash] There's no me
[Nas] In the beginnin, it was me (blastin) Nas (I'm blastin)
[Nas] I stood alone (Ashanti) but now
[Ash] Don't you know that I will never leave
[Nas] Murder Inc. y'all
[Jah] It's MURAHHHHHHHH!  Nigga, HA HA!
[Nas] It's over now; y'all know that right? (Irv Gotti!)
[Nas] Ill Will baby
[Ash] It's Murdah, for life

[Verse One: Nas]
My enemies want sorta the same respect I was born with
Godson, tatted on my chest it's permanent
The rap Albert Anastasia; you cowards
Y'all want the crown from the black power man of Asia
Snap out your dreams and prayers of takin a king's paper
Ask another rapper how it feels to lose his whole gangsta
(How it feel?) Youse a no namesta - ya little mans is no threat
You make me upset I might stank ya (blastin)
Inc. is the Murdah, Ill Will merger let my cash
make sex with yo' cash, it can't hurt us
Phones ringing off the hook, Bush and Bloomberg callin me constant
Streets wanna know the cause of that gossip
Nas is lord of the projects 'til the coffins drop
in the ocean like a Amistad slave overboat when
It's a new day ya should be scared I'm back with Stoute
Southside, Queensbridge, the hood's in here

[Chorus: Ashanti] + (Nas)
There's no me (uh talk to me) without you (There's no me y'all)
I can't be (I.N.C.) without you (Ill Will now)
Don't you know that I will never leave (talk to me now)
Leave you (It's no me y'all)
All I need (I.N.C.) need is you
There's no me

[Jah] Yeah - you talk to these niggaz Gotti
[Irv] B-b-b-blastin! I'm blastin..
[Jah] Whattup Suge?
[Ash] It's Murdah!

[Ja Rule]
And lord knows I'll, DIEEE, I pledge allegience to homicide
And murdah be the case when I kill 'em
Whyyy, would they get a nigga like me started
I'm regarded the hardest workin artist since 'Pac - NIGGAZ!
And I ain't talkin if I'm liked or better
I'm talkin if he was here we'd probably ride together
On this chick ass nigga with curls, bitch dog!
Get at me dog - Rule nigga the boss
You always been a punk now ain't it a pity
That you runnin to I.G., dyin to be me
But I pledge, I.N.C. and for the love
I'll bleed it in blood and die from hot slugs - motherfuckers

[Chorus]

[Ashanti]
Murdah I.N.C. - you know that I can't see myself
livin without you, bein without you, breathin without you baby
What you done to me - you know that I can't see myself
livin without you, bein without you, breathin without you baby

[Chorus] w/o Nas ad libs

[Chorus]

[Chorus] - in background while 'Pac talks and Gotti ad libs

[2Pac]
I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
If I should die before I wake..

[Jah] It's Murdah!!!!
[Ash] It's Murdah, for life</pre>
