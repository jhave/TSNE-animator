[Fresh Prince]
You wanna rock, Jeff lets do it a little somethin like this 
From the heart of West Philly, came my man named Jazz
With mucho pizzaz and a razzmatazz
He slice the wax, cut forward, cut back, right and exact
You know the man ain't at all wack
The magnificent movie astoundin
The crowd goin loco, kick drum poundin
People surroundin us checkin the concept
Cuttin up a storm that's why the crowd is all wet
Other DJ's standin around Jeff
Tryin not to give up props to the worlds best
Shakin his hands tryin to say that he can't flow
Cause Jeff is a horse though that they all turn to
A mellow kinda fellow but in the past he
Been known to get a attitude and get right nasty
Snatch the wax, it's a fact not a figment
To get real and rip wheels its downright ignant
And when he step off, toss the confetti
He burn more wheels that Mario Andretti
Jeff is there anythin left you wanna say to the crowd

[Break - Fresh Prince] (DJ Jazzy Jeff)
(I wanna rock right now) (*said slow*) 
Well get down now
(I wanna rock right now) (*scratched*) 
what, what, say what, what

Yo Jeff lets go back to the old set for a second
Yo Jeff (rock the beat)
Come on, and yo Jeff (rock the beat)
Come on, and yo Jeff (rock the beat)
(Yo Jeff)
 
[Fresh Prince] (DJ Jazzy Jeff)
Yo he's movin the crowd like a cloud, you gotta get a loud
Cause Jeff wants to (rock right now)
Peep the boy get swift, he got the gift
To lift, with just turntables and (rock) with
After a battle and I watched Jeff win 'em
He stomped the comp, he got cuts like venom
Doper than dope, just cope the boys def, D J J-a-zzy Jeff
On stage gettin ill beside me
Hands quicker than the eyes can see, G
After he cut ya, notice smoke still lingers
He let loose like Zeus with fire from his fingers
You wanna (rock)
Then I'm a let you (rock right now)
Hey yo Jeff gets down cause, he's superior, others inferior
I rap a whole record to try to make it clear to you
You don't get it still, I ain't gettin ill
Jeff rip the wheels, show 'em the real deal
 
[Fresh Prince - talking] (Jazzy Jeff - scratching)
(rock)
what?
(rock)
huh, go
(rock)
what huh
(rock) (repeats)
1,2,1,2,3,4

[Outro - Fresh Prince - talking] (*scratching of "rock" continues*)
In the place to be, doin it old school style
DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince about to break out
Yo fellas lets go to the island, go to the island

himmina, humani, see, himina, humini, see,
My DJ go by the name of Jazzy, little chest big tummy
Watch the man rip the wheels and a
It's almost if the things are real and a
He's the man you heard what I said
