This is how it should be done (Pump, pump, pump that bass)

Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
Why you wanna do me so bad (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
Why, why me, baby
Girl, tell me why, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
You broke my heart

This is how it should be done [Pump, pump that bass]

[LL Cool J]
Let me tell you what happened to me
Couldn't believe my girl was down with O.P.P.
I went to the movies to get her off my mind
And saw her holdin' hands with the next man in line (Ooh the next man)
So I jumped in my Benz in a fury
But first I took back all my jewelry (All my jewelry, babe)
Reminiscin' bout the things that I gave her
Teachin' the crab how to roll with the flavor (Ooh, yeah)
Fingers, navels and ears look chunky
Then she flipped the script and cold got funky
(Sho got funky with me, babe)
Hair's done, nails lookin' polished
But here's two dollars, now take the bus back to Hollis (Ooh, yeah)

[Hook]
Why, why me, baby (This is how it should be done)
Why you wanna do me so bad
Why, why me, baby
For you I sing this song
Why, why me, baby
You broke my heart (Pump, pump, pump that bass)

[LL Cool J]
It all started when I was drivin' in my Cougar
Didn't have no dope, yet schemin' to maneuver (Maneuver)
On my way to the grocery store
Dress was whack and the girl was raw (Girl was raw, yeah)
And as I stared in her eyes I realized she had potential
Gettin' her number was essential (Had potential)
217-633 somethin' is disconnected
I can't believe she frontin' kid (Ooh)
Next time that I seen her, I rolled on her crew (Yeah)
What up, Miss, that's how you do (Ooh)
Cuff, snatched her, grabbed her by the neck (Oh, yeah)
Slobbed her down with all do respect (Ooh, why)

[Hook]
Why, why me, baby
Why you wanna do me so bad (This is how it should be done)
Why, why me, baby
I'm begging, little girl, I'm so all alone
Why, why me, baby (Then I kicked it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, babe (Marley Marl, take us to the bridge)

[Keith Sweat]
Girl, you did me wrong (You did me wrong, babe) girl, I'm all alone
Tell me why you did not tell me why, tell me
Baby, just take my hand, I don't understand
Tell me why you did the things you did, baby
(Pump, pump, pump that bass)

[Hook]
Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
Why you wanna do me so bad
Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
Sometimes girl I'm up for all night long
Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
You broke my heart (Pump, pump, pump that bass)

[LL Cool J]
Two years and a hundred grand later
35 packages on the escalator
Eaves dropping at the mall like "I Spy"
I seen her runnin' up on this kid from "Do Or Die" (Mmm, babe)
Rushed the scene like a wild vigilante
My girl is givin' up the skins, oh no it can't be
Another brother is tastin' her toes
Makin' her sweat, damn, and everybody else knows

[Keith Sweat]
Was it good (Yeah) was she right (Yeah)
Every night did she hold you tight (Yeah)
Nice and tight, did she fight (Mmm, hmm)
Did she flip you like dynamite (Word up)
Was she hot (Yeah) hot to trot (Uh-huh)
Did she really, really hit the spot (You know it)

[LL Cool J]
Full of the chick and I'm sick of the chick
And I'm flippin' it on the remix
Pumpin' and jumpin' and bumpin'
Dumpin' the girlie in the mix (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, babe)

[Hook]
Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
Why you wanna do me so bad (Can I kiss it)
Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
For you I sing this sad, sad song
Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
You broke my heart (Pump, pump) (And L Cool and Keith wrecked it)

[Keith Sweat]
I know that you and me were meant to be
Baby, baby, baby, can't you see (Kick it)
Girl, look me right here in the eye
They say that a man ain't supposed to cry (Kill em' uh)
Get down on my hands and knees
And beg you, baby, please, please (Yeah), please (Played yourself, baby)
Don't break my heart (Played yourself, baby, that's how it is)
Yeah, yeah, baby

[Hook to fade]
Why, why me, baby
Why you wanna do me so bad
Why, why me, baby
Yeah, yeah, you make me hang out so all night long
Why, why me, baby
You broke my heart</pre>
