[Intro: DMX]
I just wish we all understood, the beauty, of music...
Grrrrr, just listen

[Chorus 2X: singers] + (DMX)
Keeeeeep (YEAH!) your heeeeead (WHAT!)
To the skyyyyyyyy (uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, C'MON!)

[DMX]
When I think I don't deserve it - I think about Jesus
and the fact that he was perfect and he thinks that I'm worth it
I know I got a purpose
So when I don't like what I see in the mirror, I learn to look past the surface
Believe me God heard this, cause these words came from my heart
I was in pain, it was dark!
Then came the spark to light down the road
and let me know, He would lighten up my load
And it's gon' get greater, later
God only wants the BEST for me but the devil's a hater
I can see his eyes through the smiles of fake friends
Y'all think hate wins, just keep waitin!
At the end of the day who's will will you think will prevail?
Or will you live to tell?
Miracle after miracle'll come through
The spiritual individual is IN you!

[Chorus]

[DMX]
Lord if you hear me, you know that I'm comin to you sincerely
I need you near me, please feel me
I'm sick and I need for you to heal me
I'm lost and lookin for the real me, I'm tired and weary
Haven't been able to see things clearly
Even though I know you love me DEARLY, I still get leery!
So where does that leave me? Lost and alone
Wanna call God but it's like I lost my phone
Every DAY is a struggle, cause I juggle my problems
Need to let go and let God cause only He can solve 'em
I'm tired of lyin to myself! Thinkin I can do it on my own
But when I get left alone
is when the devil sneaks in and creeps in
Knocks on the door lightly and creaks in
And it's usually around the weekend
Then I get reckless and jump off the deep end!

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[singer]
Keeeeeep your heeeeead, to the skyyyyyyyy {*repeat to the end*}

[Outro: DMX]
Man, man, man
This, is somethin special
Keep your head to the sky
He didn't bring me this far to let me go
And that's, just what it is
