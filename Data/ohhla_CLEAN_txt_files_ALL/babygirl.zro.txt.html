[Verse 1]
You ain't nothing like my last chick
Matter of fact you got me hoping this relationship can last
Ask no questions cause I feel like I been granted my wish(granted my wish)
Been a long time since a brother felt like this (felt like this)
I'm not going to the club tonight I'm staying home
Me and my woman some Isley Brothers and sip this Patron
My homies they be laughin at me telling me that I'm sprung
But I'm in the zone when it comes to lil mama cause she the one
What I really love about her she don't even need a man 
But she follow my lead and respect the fact I wear the pants 
and I got no problem hullin myself cause she my queen
Half the time I spoil her half the time I'm tryin to get her out her jeans
Z-ro still a gangsta he never been a romantic
He spends most of his time with semi and fully automatics
although my baby been givin me reasons to leave the streets
So instead of shootin up the block Imma take baby out to eat 

[Chorus]
Cuz she my baby girl
I'm used to the wrong woman 
Now I got my own woman
She so good to me she gotta be my
Baby girl

No Longer do I have to search
She a diamond she down to Earth
Its Understood to me she gotta be mine
Baby Girl

And Everytime we sexing
That hidden room is like a weapon
Hey she gotta be mine
Baby Girl

More than anything she my friend
It ain't all about the skins
I don't ever want this to end.

[Verse 2]
She don't ever have to worry if I'm cheating
I'm on the way home to give that bottom a beating
Even though I'm what they call a rap singer
Wit business to handle I got time to Carat my woman neck and her finger (Yea its that deep) 
She there for me when life get hard for me
And if i get busted she willing to take the charge for me
But I can't see her wit handcuffs on for me
Soon as they fingerprint 
She go be there wit my bond money
Feelin like Martin Luther King Free at Last
I hate you bitch is a thing of the past
Not totally though I still got up a couple walls
But on the other hand I be feeing for her phone calls
And I'll be mad if I don't get it
I ain't to gangsta to admit it 
So don't play wit me when I'm stressing
I'll take yo shit and split it
Hell naw she ain't no hoe She my old lady 
The one that's go gave 3 or4 of Z-ro's babies

[Chorus]
Baby girl
I'm used to the wrong woman 
Now I got my own woman
She so good to me she gotta be my
Baby girl

No Longer do I have to search
She a diamond she down to Earth
Its Understood to me she gotta be mine
Baby Girl

And Everytime we sexing
That hidden room is like a weapon
Hey she gotta be mine
Baby Girl

More than anything she my friend
It ain't all about the skins
I don't ever want this to end

[Verse 3]
When I come home my bath water and my food ready
And that lingere she be wearin be keeping the mood steady
Lord Heaven must have got robbed cause an Angel is gone
I'm guilty as charged Lord cause she all up in my home
Just let me keep her I'll protect her from the whole universe
I'll say I do in sickness and in health for better or worse
Imma still kick it wit all four homies alive
When I'm not in Europe letting baby shop until she drop
I'm the King and what good is a Queen if she can't rule wit ya
Get out there like one of the homies and act a fool wit ya
What's mine is hers she ain't gotta borrow nothing
Watch I'll buy her a beauty shop and a foreign car or something
And what's hers is mine. All I want is her heart 
And of Course that secret hidden treasure when her legs come apart
And if I was to ever fall off my game she wouldn't leave me
She'd help me get back on my feet and back on my CHANGE

[Chorus]
Baby girl
I'm used to the wrong woman 
Now I got my own woman
She so good to me she gotta be my
Baby girl

No Longer do I have to search
She a diamond she down to Earth
Its Understood to me she gotta be mine
Baby Girl

And Everytime we sexing
That hidden room is like a weapon
Hey she gotta be mine
Baby Girl

More than anything she my friend
It ain't all about the skinsI don't ever want this to end</pre>
