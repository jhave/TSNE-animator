[La the Darkman]
I'm nineteen, doing nothing but getting that green
Lexus C, playin' the club scene
Every weekend, catch me with a different Puerto Rican
Mami, who wanna do nothing but slide me
I'm movin' on a twinkies dip, eyes chunky
Gucci hat, Gucci sweater, couldn't feel better
Stayin' at the bar, in the limelight
Got the four fifth and a box cutter, I'm tight
Drink all night, think all night
Rock a new Air Force One's all white
Bitches sweatin' me, niggas eyein' my style
It's all good, ain't fucked a nigga up in a while
Then Fats walked in, then Shay walked in
Then Raboo, Shotti Screw, and Kay walked in
Aight now, my click just stepped in the place
First nigga act up, I'mma blow him in his face
Where Leopard Ed, them niggas at home in the bed
With 'Lonzo, he with his wiz and his seeds, yo
Back to the storo', this nigga keep lookin' at me
That's the same nigga, every weekend, I see
At, every bar, that, I got to
He starin' at me, duke, do I know you?
Nah, you don't know, but I seen you around, though
Shark Bar and Palladium in New Ro'
Geez, I'm tryin' to figure out, this nigga steez
He remember the spots, where he seen me at, please
What's your name, dun? Steve, what you do? Slang trees
You see this platinum Roli', hangin' off my sleeve
My first thought, yeah, get faster ticket
Get his chain and his watch, leave his ass butt naked
Second thought, this nigga gotta be playin'
He got his jewelry, all out in the club
But why he so quick, tell me, he sell drugs
All my niggas drinkin' Crystal, standin' on the wall
Not knowin' this nigga, gon' be, my downfall
And none of us look like, the working type
Nine to five, never had a job in my life
I'm proud of that, whitey ain't pimpin' me
Even though I might see the penitentiary
Still trying to pull a Heist to the Century
Make bitches catch chills when you mention me
Yo Steve, I don't fuck with drugs, yo
Got a record company and we about to blow
Yo money, don't tell me that lame shit
Save it for the cops, I could see you sell bricks
What's your name? La, look La, I ain't the one
Won't you just come kick it with me, sometime, son
We exchange math, hit 'em, straight routine way
Believe, the nigga, hit me up the next day
Yo, La, this Steve, what's the deal, my friend
Yo, I'm havin' a party, and I want you attend
Come through, as a matter fact, bring your crew
Sing Sing Killas, and the niggas from the Wu
Damn, this kid know my whole family
This might be the connect I want, can't be
Cuz he movin' too fast, one day, if he got cash
I'mma check him out, dun, how I get to your lab
It's upstate, take the Deacon in the Westchester
Just come through, La, and I'mma bless ya
I got models, about thirty Crys' bottles
And after they get drunk, they suck and swallow
I'm there, what time, yo, it start around nine
Got thirty girls coming, nothin' less than a dime
I show up at the crib, four garage mansion
Walked in, nothin' but bad bitches dancin'
Some dancing with niggas, some dancing together
I think to myself, it can't get no better
What up Steve, yo, La, my friend
You late, had a hard time gettin' in?
It's good to see you, and your people
Look La, I'mma tell you just what I wanna do
To the point, I got about four hundred bricks
And my only problem is movin' the shit
What you Cuban, Dominican, but what does that matter
My only concern, is makin' your pockets fatter
I'm watchin' you, all the clubs, spendin' cheese
What your stash look like, I guess a hundred g's
For me, that's enough to buy about ten ki's
Ten thousand a piece, chine white, capisce?
Oh no, this shit can't be true
Offerin' that price in New York, should of knew
yo Steve, I don't play up out my change
La, my friend, this is not a gamee
Think I'd bring you to my home, just to play
Yo, Steve, all type of shit happened today
But anyway, I hope, you keepin' it real
Cuz you know, I might take you up on that deal
Thinkin', to myself, this price is a steal
See him a couple times, son, I could stack a mil'
Hung out with him, Cheetah's, Envy, a few times
Ran a couple train, on a few dimes
I'm kickin' it, harder than I ever did
Copped a house, built an arcade in it for my kids
Race cars, Tekken, pool tables, cool
I'm lovin' my life, everything was goin' smooth
Doin', yeah, forty bricks a month
Drinkin' nothin' but Crys', smokin' hydro blunts
Shay copped a Benz, Fats copped a Benz
Screw copped a Caddy, Kay stacked his ends
And damn, I wish I would of did the same
Everything fucked up when them indictments came
F.B.I. at my door, must of got the wrong name, it's a bust
And sir, you comin' with us
And we know what you been doin', for the last twelve months
Fuck, I got dough, I'm going to trail, yo
But Steve was a fed, Donnie Brasco</pre>
