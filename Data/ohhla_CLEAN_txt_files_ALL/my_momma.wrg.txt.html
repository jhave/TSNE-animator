Song:   My Momma
Typed by: itsfinest@aol.com

Yo I wanna take this time out to dedicate this song 
to one of the most beautiful ladies in the world
could never imagine
Yeah, Ole Mae, that's my momma, y'know
To one of the most beautifulest ladies in the world
I love ya momma, keep it strong for ya

Chorus: repeat 2X

My momma, used to tell me quit smoking weed
My momma, gave me everthing I need
My momma, said keep faith in God
My momma, momma, momma, momma, momma

[Warren G]
From the beginning, soon as my feet touched the earth
For what it's worth, she loved the boy from birth
Kept me fed, combed my head
and tapped that tail when I didn't do what she said
Through the years comin up momma always provided
And when the times got rough momma always tried to hide it
Divide it among us, but pardon the youngsters
Told us never to lie, smoke dope, and cuss
She stood tall and proud like a supermodel on a catwalk
And momma didn't take no back talk
She's the main reason why I roll today
That's why I dedicate this to Ole Mae
That's my momma

Chorus

[Warren G]
As a young teenager I started to clown
My momma did all she could to try to slow me down
Tired of her son be brought by the cops
Sent to go stay with my pops
He taught me to be my own man, and when I disrespected 
he put me out on the streets to find my own land
Now I'm servin on the urban street corner
Smokin bud, sippin Coronas in Long Beach, California
But I promised my momma I would make it to the top
And use this rap to put her in the drop
She the main reason why I roll today
That's why I dedicate this here to my Ole Mae

Chorus

[Warren G]
As I grew up, blew up in the G-Funk Era
I see my momma everytime I take a look in the mirror
I'm thankful she gotta chance to see me shine
My momma's in my heart and my soul and mind
Controllin mine, so I can stand strong
For ya grandkids to let em know that ya spirit lives on
I really miss you, but I know ya looking over
Lead me on the right track, the angel's on my shoulder

Chorus

[Warren G]
So I want y'all to treasure ya mom
Ya know, so if y'all got a bad relationship
or y'all on bad terms, patch it up
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Thats a precious jew-el
Remember that, we all gotta go through it
So stay strong, down dis, dis road, ya know
But I cant forget about all the poeple
Out there that I love, and got my back
So I'm gonna go ahead and im gonna shoot a shout out
My daddy, my sistas, my brothers, my girl, my kids
my cousins, my aunties, my uncles, my grandmomma
my granddaddy, all my homeboys, all my homegirls 
and everybody out there that got love, knowwhatI'msaying?
We gotta keep it like that, we gotta keep it groovin</pre>
