[Rihanna]
On the first page, of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out, so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have, their wicked schemes
And you take that, to new extremes
But you'll always be, my hero
Even though you've lost, your mind

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, ohhhh
I love the way you lie...

[Rihanna]
Now there's gravel, in our voices
Glasses shatter from, the fight
In this tug-of-war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words, and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
are what keeps me satisfied

[Chorus]

[Rihanna]
Ohhhhhhhh-ohhh
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls, are goin up
in smoke with all, our memories!

[Eminem]
This morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
(Shhhh) Hush baby speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
that you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me!
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby without you I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that shove me, in the aftermath of the
destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
that we'll have each other's backs, cause we're that lucky!
Together we move mountains
Let's not make mountains out of molehills, you hit me twice, yeah but who's countin?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love, is crazy we're nuts, but I refuse counselin
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
Cause with you I'm in my fuckin mind, WITHOUT YOU I'M OUT IT~!

[Chorus]

[Rihanna]
I love the way you lie...
I love the way you lie...</pre>
