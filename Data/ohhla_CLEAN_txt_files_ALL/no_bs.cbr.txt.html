[Verse 1]
3 in the mornin, you know I'm horny
So why don't you come over my place, and put a smile on my face
Leavin the club, shawty hurry up
So we can get this party started, and take off our clothes now
You already know what time it is, reach up in that dresser where them condoms is
And baby when I get it, I'll never let go
Gonna take it slow

[Pre-Chorus]
We ain't gon stop til 9 a.m, if you can't take it all baby say when
Make you cum over and over again, and I'm a leave it in

[Chorus]
When we do it, all night
We can do it, all night
Girl I'm a give it to you, all night
So fly girl
Don't you be on that bullshit (yeah yeah), all night [x3]
So fly girl

[Verse 2]
