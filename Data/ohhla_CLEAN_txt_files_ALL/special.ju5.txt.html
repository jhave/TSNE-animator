[Kid]
You guys workin' on a new album?
	Yeah
Great!
	You wanna hear a new album?
I wanna be on the album
	I don't know about that

[Soup]
Check it out yo,
It's clear I'm burnin' out the candles here
The open-toed sandals here
I finesse any way I dress
Capital F-R-E-S-H so fresh

[Chali 2na]
Yo, the mass men who suppress pain like aspirin
Jurass men are the best trained assassin
Your class pins get thrown in the trash bins
You leaches and has-beens get your teeth smashed in
Hot as you'd keep a furnace
We kept it earnest
Poems puncture your epidermis
And swell up enormous
Smoother than candles or flannel pajamas
We raid the city on camels
And dismantle informers
The omen

[Akil]
We blowin' never knowing where we goin'
When we flowin' with the fresh word spoken
Your chokin' cuz my mikes smokin'
Hopin' that you get a chance to get into the open for some fresh air
But you already there
Ay yo I'm in the clear
West of the hemisphere J5 musketeers
Zorro with the oral editorial
The moral of the story I'm professional

Chorus: (2X)
J5 MC's
Then it's on!

[Marc 7]
Yo, I'm never cautious on MC's that make me nauseous
I feel that it's important
So Let's write and go record this
No need for applause
If you're kickin' the raw shit
We rotate tracks double back, just like swordfish
Word gifts is given when precision is I
Dominator, illustrator of this lyrical pie
Why you livin' a lie
Just unloosen your tie
So you can check the way we do this
In conclusion we fly

[Soup]
With the view from the bird's eye
With words I flown
I symbolize the skull and the cross bones
S to the O-U, P to the izzay
Sharp like the blade that stabbed the back of the OJ's

Chorus (1X)

Jurassic 5 ya'll...
I'll rock the dock about to block back
To the underground until the next ground
Yo yo yo,I need a beat, a beat!</pre>
