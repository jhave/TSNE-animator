[Kool Keith]
The rap game has changed
You got four different types of promoters
The luxury promoter, the hustler promoter, and the alternative promoter
Of course the roach promoter
The luxury promoter is basically the top pop promoter
He'll book Neil Diamond, fly a 20-piece band overseas
Take out stadium insurance, pay artists three hundred thousand
Four half months ahead, with no problem
Run advertisements on Billboard, TV
Usually teamed up with big investors who write checks
The hustler promoter, he's as good as the little bit
for the luxury for the ghetto celeb treatment
Usually book acts to prove he can do it, the hustler promoter
He'll make you feel like a big star
At home whether he's a pimp, drug dealer, gambler
He'll supply the best treatment, money up front
Paper bag ten to fifty grand cash, limo to and from
Five star hotel, he'll even include girls
He'll take you to dinner and chaffeur around his hood
Let you see how he's livin, not a hater
If he had a girl cousin he'd even let you meet her, THUMBS UP~!
Jacuzzi and everything, big radio advertisement
The alternative promoter uses weeklies and internet
Is a little strict, scared to spend, usually out of billions
The ones that do raves, go out baller style
Brand new clubs, new mics, also travel to and from
But others messed it up so it don't drop the same
Has sense to crease, they cuttin it
They also cut into the rap game for low prices on artists
the hustler promoter already treated well, sometimes tricky
The roach promoter, wants you to pay your own travel
Does not even have SHIT together, no transportation
Runner, a small cheap venue, usually holes in the wall
Don't have a liquor license
Wants to book you, with 20 acts for five hundred bucks
Still uses flyers in Motel 6's, and Travelodges
When you see a guy with a tiny Volkswagen goin back and forth
pickin up a known artist up, from the airport
Most of the time a rejected whack rapper don't fuck with 'em!
