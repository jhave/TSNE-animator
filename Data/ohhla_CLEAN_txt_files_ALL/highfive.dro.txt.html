[Young Dro] *variations throughout*
High five (high five) high five (high five)
Hey (whats happ'nin)

[Chorus] 2X
When you in the club and you see me (high five)
You know I'm just a thug when you see me (high five)
You know I'm that fresh man I keep the shit live
When you see a playa what you give him (high five)

[Verse 1]
Dro... it's good to be back I been gone nigga (what)
It's been long nigga (what) I been strong nigga (where you been)
I been in Bankhead Co and Herner Homes nigga (where you been)
I been wit niggaz from Simpson to Culver homes
Westside nigga (hey) Y'all niggaz betta mount up
Big rim Jolly Rancher cars y'all mount up
Do my damn dance work my legs pop my hands
Like do it nigga (yep) do it nigga (yep hey)
Young money yep I want a blockhead ho
The block said "Dro you need to drop" well here it go
(Let's go hey) Gone (Go hey) Gone (hey)
Man I'm in the hood like a Nextel phone
When the work come CHIRP then purp come CHIRP
Then prototype Chevy it's a James Bond 'vert
All we do is work and holla "fu-fu-fuck'em"
Westside man we gon bu-bu-buss'em

[Chorus] 2X
When you in the club and you see me (high five)
You know I'm just a thug when you see me (high five)
You know I'm that fresh man I keep the shit live
When you see a playa what you give him (high five)

[Verse 2]
My Chevy paint flippin on my rims got that indiglo
When it get dark rim glowin like my wrist glow
F-650 pro my rims look like 64s
Sit taller than everybody I'm up there with the red lights
Slick Dro it's me chicken money KFC
Crispy dark meat the carbon come in all heat
You know how the mob be they got me eatin shark meat
Order me a snail plate I think I want some frog meat
Triple thick chinchilla take the skin off the lizard
Put it on the Benz interior... imperial
I'm bustin and I'm furious I'm scratchin off the stereo
Knock him off tonight and in the morning let his children know
Bitches get flip-flopped I feed 'em all Cheerios
Shine on them 24's I know how to get a ho
Big bank wet paint Jackie Chan stereo
Money hungry Dro eatin paper like a billy goat

[Chorus] 2X
When you in the club and you see me (high five)
You know I'm just a thug when you see me (high five)
You know I'm that fresh man I keep the shit live
When you see a playa what you give him (high five)

[Verse 3]
High five westside Bankhead prolly clean on me
Four 15's so you know my trunk really beat
Screens start flippin when they flip here the DVD
Ridin down Simpson me and T.I. watchin "Lean on Me"
Carbon 16 on me 30 carat ring on me
Dro be on BET and plus he fuck wit Sheila E
Beamer Z car in the hospital the 'vert V
Cut the top off the Jag... open brain surgery
Box on the Bourbon seats they know me out in Germany
Frog green Kermit Jeep 23's my rims be
Plus I be on Mimm street Kimberly remember me
Tell them haters get on they job I need energy
Leelee gangsta grill wit me Trineshia spent a mill wit me
Ralph I got a bunch like middle school... feelin me?
Baby mama Dolce Gabana ask Tiereney
Dark on black buttons I'm ridin on nothin's

[Chorus] 2X
When you in the club and you see me (high five)
You know I'm just a thug when you see me (high five)
You know I'm that fresh man I keep the shit live
When you see a playa what you give him (high five)
