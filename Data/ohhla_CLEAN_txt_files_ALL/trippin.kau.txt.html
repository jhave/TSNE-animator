  [Kaydo] Trying to put him six feet deep; underneath the concrete
O.G. is back on the streets So niggaz, grip the heat; it's on once again
   [Cell] While he soaking round the block, on the swing
  [Kaydo] Fresh out the pe-en
[Kausion] Damn!
   [Cell] We's out to be in this mothafucka for trying to loc up
  [Kaydo] ?For hold up?
   [Cell] Niggaz ain't gone choke up
We gotsta play another plot to put him on his back
 [Gonzoe] And this full-prove nigga known missing on the attacks Where he at
  [Kaydo] The last time I seen him he was toast
   [Cell] Straight sittin' at the liquor store, coast
 [Gonzoe] My temper's roasted 
This nigga that snatch my hearing bone
Body slams sale would chase Cell all the way home
  [Kaydo] So fuck that 
   [Cell] No, I got tha shit under control
[Kausion] The fool who put us on is the fool who get his head blown

[Chorus: Kausion]
O.G.'s trippin', lil' homies dippin'
why you wanna fuck with me
Fool we flossing, nigga this Kausion
sowing up the whole West scene

[Mack 10]
Yeah y'all niggaz got to respect yo mothafucking G
Check this here, out of the whole terme I was locked
y'all niggaz didn't never seen me or wipped up 
Ey Kaydo what you got on my set little nigga

 [Gonzoe] We watching every move he make
Anticipating which bone to break
Grab my properties, bake em up and shake em
   [Cell] I'm trying to lay in my cull connecting every bolo
Watch wings, stompin they mouth Trying to break his collarbone and spleen
 [Gonzoe] We bring fast kicking and stitches, to bitches who trippin
Reveal the .38's for pistol-whippin'
  [Kaydo] Man, I told ya nigga Kaydo was that corner too quick
I ran around the block and got the foot long clip
It's filled to the tip
   [Cell] Straight prepared, full equipped
 [Gonzoe] But no buzzin cuz catching the ale ain't the shit
So we went from the shoulders, mobbed the hood souljah
Set trippin Kausion. Dippin like I told ya

[Chorus]

[Mack 10]
Yea ok ok Y'all lil' niggaz wanna do it like this
You must have forgot, I call the mothafucking shots around here
and I'm-a have all your mama's crying

 [Gonzoe] He played the big brother role, to other souls
Where I stay Pelican Bay turned the nigga the wrong way
  [Kaydo] He smoked 50 sacks wit us till day get dark
Used to ? weed at the fiends ? at the park
   [Cell] It's like one less (Cell &amp;   [Kaydo] one less) fool we gotsta worry about
Mopped his ass up the clap, Kaydo and  [Gonzoe] No doubt
 [Gonzoe] Kausion niggaz stomp niggaz the worst
Fucked up cuz you test us first

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
