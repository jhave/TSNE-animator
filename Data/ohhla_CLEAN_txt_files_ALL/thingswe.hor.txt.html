[Intro: Horace Brown harmonizing]
Awwwwwwhhhh, Awwwwwwhhhh!!
OOOOHHHHHHHH, YEAH!! YEAH!!
 
[Chorus: Horace Brown]
Diamond rings, pearls and things
Trips in December
Things we do for love
Fancy cars, the credit cards
Do you remember?
Things we do for love
 
[Verse One: Horace Brown]
Romantic places in my mind
Hoping someday I would find
The perfect one
And I could share
And then the day you walked inside
And no longer could I hide 
My love, I had to take you there
Sailing on a cruise at night "Sailing on a cruise at night!"
Gazing to the ocean under moonlight "Yeaahh Yeahh!"
Taking you to paradise "Paradise baby"
OOOOHHHHHHHH, YEAH!! YEAH!!
 
[Chorus: Horace Brown]
 
[Verse Two: Horace Brown]
I showered you with gifts of love
But it was never enough
To bring; you closer to me
Tricking money was no thing
The simple pleasure that you bring 
My way; takes me back to the day 
We were.. sailing on a cruise at night
"Sailing on a cruise at night!"
Gazing to the ocean under moonlight "Under moonlight"
Taking you to paradise, taking you to paradise
Awwwwwwhhhh, YEAH!! YEAH!!
 
[Chorus: Horace Brown]
 
[Interlude: Horace Brown] 
The things we do for love!!
YEAH!! YEAH!!
The things we do for love!!
Awwwww AHHHHHH!!!
OOOOHHHHHHHH YEEEAHHHH!!
The things we do for love!!
Mantigo Bay!!
 
[Chorus: Horace Brown until fade]
