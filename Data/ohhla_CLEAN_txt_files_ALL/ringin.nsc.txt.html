[Verse 1]
You take on face value how fast the light travel
It's seven cent gift from the Universe
Blessings, tired of Offerings
There's no compromisin' the truth
It might blow the roof off
Exposin' the Germ, take Worm
Poison animal eaters you must learn
Let me teach you how to see through six
Risin' above the mist, the naked eye can hardly detect
When I'm in effect, live and direct
It's the East New York section of Brooklyn
Bangin' ass beat make you wanna free techniques
We spray the Arts sword swingin' piss in the Heart
Sharp as a nigga on Prom Night
We strike wit a Vengeance
Givin' y'all the maximum sentence
Each sentence is like a time line for you to define
How to rhyme coincide and relate, to my last take
'No Said Date', say it loud 'Yo I'm Black and Proud'
The Cracker fuckin' backin' for any form of disrespect
To my Nations -- Seasonry and paper chasin'
For the God to agree
Guarantee to disassemble any MC stepin' in the place to be
Off the head I wrote this one in Red
For the Blood of all my people that said it
For the Cause, our Microphone ripped so swift

[Dr. Benjamin Muhammad]
'What is Justice'?
'Justice is the law that distinguish between Right and Wrong'
'What then is Justice, that we may do Justice?'
'The face of a killer is your face, my face, our face'

[Verse 2]
This first MC Law he swore to make the crowd raw
Came up through the floor drew his Mic from his hip and began
To squeeze Clip, son said 'Don't kill 'em as quick'
Let 'em do tray, palm stay 18 Jay
Who made it possible for you to witness?
First born built the weather to storm
Bees swarm like hundred witness scorn
This is warnin' to the people we sip in sour
Breezin' through the Caroline distribution
Pipe line spark it equal
Guarded people as divine makes it's final descent
To the Pavement, who laced it?, keepin' it basic
Who is this Ivory Jamel Ring Bells through out the city?
A few know him well this description Black Male
Wit the Universe who flag drippin' off as the Bell

[Dr. Benjamin Muhammad]
'God is the Number 1 Killer'
'He out killed...Genghis Khan...Kublai Khan
...Pamalane...Yes he did'
'He out killed Hitler...out killed Mussolini'
...Out killed Napoleon'
'When God gets ready to kill he wipes...Cold, Complete'
'God the Killer'</pre>
