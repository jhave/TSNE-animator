[Verse 1]
When I rap I be shaking 'em
Every song that I write D.J. banging 'em
So you say that I'm whack but they playin' 'em
Got Ferraris and cribs and ya'll hating 'em nothing to say to THEMMMM
I out rated them, and my flow, fo sho, out dated them
Yes you were number one cause you paying them
I be checking, the scams you scam, GODDAMN who you fooling' man?
Inconspicuous, how I'm riding this thing it's ridiculous
Me and Timothy, ya'll can't get rid of us
I got aspirin for when ya'll get sick of us down your esophagusssss
Ya'll ain't stopping me, ya'll just watching me like a pornography
Ya'll say ya'll ain't mad but you just gotta be
Cause the dough that you spend is Monopoly
Fake Spender

[Chorus]
HEY BIG SPENDER! Spend.. A Little Time With.. Me!

[Verse 2]
Life is fiction, I got a bad cursing addiction (F.U.!)
'xuse my diction, if you screwing my man, I've got big guns. (Gun Fire)
I got good sense, now reach in your pocket it's full of lint
That's why ya'll don't like me it's evident 
Cause the rumors you spreading's, irrelevant. TRICKKKK!
See my third eye, you can't out the game even if you try
You sleepin' on me? Here's a Rock-A-Bye
Split atoms just like a Gemini, player give me my, F-F-Five Mics
As for getting my money, it's my rhyme
Knuckle up Mother suckers it's my time
Cause I've been in this game, you just in your prawn

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Beats contagious, my flow come in all kinds of flavors
Ya'll haters just mad we ain't neighbors
Cause my fans scream like they in labor (AHHHHHHHHHH)
I don't know ya'll, I've been rocking the shows before ya'll
And I'm hotter than hot, I take no calls
If you think this is hot then go whack-off (OHHHHHH)
To my real fans, who support me and play me in caravans
To every woman, and every man
No disrespect but I'm just chilling MANNNNNN
This is open Mics, you know Missy always gots to keep it tight
You know that I know what you all's like
Fake thugs with no dough you ain't livin' right
Fake Spender

[Chorus]

(Applause)</pre>
