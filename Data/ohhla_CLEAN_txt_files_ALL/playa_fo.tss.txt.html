[Beeda Weeda]
So many pretty girls
Pop pink bottle, plottin on that pretty pearl
Get it poppin, get it rockin, yeah it's yo' world
Tryin to get you to the house, I'm lookin for a go girl
Get it get it go girl, take it to the flo' girl
I'ma beat it up and let you tell it to my old girl
Playa fo' life, I ain't thinkin of wife
I ain't thinkin of twice; bitch I'm thinkin tonight
Green light she ready, we on that Rozay heavy
We goin straight to the house it ain't no need for the telly
I'm steak eggs and jelly, bitch I'ma fill that belly
She like "Beeda you nasty~!" I'm like "Bitch you ready?"
I'm like Snoop and $hort, I don't love these hoes
and only two can roll, cause I love my folks
See I was +Born to Mack+, big dick, big house
and by "6 In Tha Mornin'" I be kickin them out (okay!)

[Chorus]
{Hey pre-tty girl - come stay the night with me}
{But in the mor-ning yes bitch you've got to leave}
{And no I can't be your man} I'ma be a playa fo' life
I'ma be a playa fo' life
Bitch; I'ma be a playa fo' life
I'ma be a playa fo' life

[Dom Kennedy]
Look! She love it when I grab those hips
I don't know her name but I had those lips, ay!
Fuck it you a bad lil' bitch
Got an ass so fat that her pants gon' rip, uhh
And I can tell your man ain't shit
Cause she told me all day but she say it ain't shit uhh
And you know I be layin that stick
I be hittin homeruns, you be payin that rent
Yeah I took her to my office, the girl just lost it
$hort came through and you know the bitch tossed it
Why you always axe how much shit costin?
Real money know that you ain't even gotta floss it
My Roley don't tick and you wastin my time
I want you home girl look I'm changin my mind
I really live what I say in my rhymes
and I never chase hoes, gotta stay on my grind like

[Chorus]

[Too $hort]
... You want the keys and the codes
to the house and the safe, spinach frees at the stove?
But bitch - I don't shoot hoop I shoot bitches to the left
I charge these hoes for the game and the dick!!
I'm from the O-A-K
So I already know what the hoe gon' say
I need to lock her down, and wife her up
but I don't wanna marry her, I just like to fuck!
When your mother was a young thang... I knew her
Even back then, I ain't wanna do her
And now... I don't fuck cougars
Your daddy was a player mayne, why you such a loser?
It's the game - and I'm a player for real
Not the NBA, or the NFL
I make deals! I'm on a life-long hustle
Gettin this money, lil' bitch I don't trust you

[Chorus]</pre>
