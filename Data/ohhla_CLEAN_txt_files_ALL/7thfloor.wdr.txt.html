Everyday we get down
Everyday we get down
Everyday we get down
On our knees

Verse 1:
[Witchdoctor]
Black guy, who am I
You know the bullet
EJ, Im back for these triggers
Now watch me pull it
Somebody's hit
You betta bring the yellow tape
You got bit by a snake
The black Mamba
My home is the trees
My spirit got your city under siege
Im shootin fleas
That's the dog in me
We all could be
Fightin' wars
With that Nigga in the mirror
I see it clearer, Lord
I'm a music whore
Up against me you can't score
A-T-L
Where we live in heaven and hell
Land where we buy and sell
I'm comin' for this clientele
Uhh, I'ma make you never wanna rap again
If I gotta snap again
On this wax again
I'm flippin' my flap again
Got me on the streets
Strapped again

Chorus x2

Verse 2:
[Cee-Lo of Goodie Mob]
Wait,
Its dim lit
At this table I sit
Constant contemplation of crimes of passion 
To commit
I'm patient with poetry
And very particular 'bout the
Parts I play
The first thing that comes to mind
Is not always the brightest thing to say
Always analytical
To articulate what I speak
Unusually unique
The technique about the price of antique
Considered collectable
Wanted to be received
And related to, so
Its written respectable
And I was
Dreamin' when I wrote this
About you and about me
About who we were before, who we are now
And who I think we need to be
Paint a picture in your mindframe
That I think you need to see
As - long - as - we
Agree to disagree
Im a tree deep rooted
Paragraphs are precisely executed
Still when its completed
Offer constructive criticism
Cause I need it
Um, may God forgive me
If anything I say is wrong
I'm just trying to be strong
And the day is long
But I'ma tell you what I know
I'ma give you what I owe
My life is the test
And I can not transgress
Ill be held accountable
For the light 
I could have shed
This is bigger than me
Im bein led, 
To preach and teach, and reach
Anyone I can
Turn a Nigga into a black man
There's no beginnin' and there is no end
I want to be in that Mamba
When the Saints go marchin in
So I'm gon, I'm gon, I'm gon

Chorus x2

[Cee-Lo] (while chorus repeats)     
Just get down
uhuh, uhuh
And I will get down
One time you know
And I will get down
On my knees
Check it out y'all
