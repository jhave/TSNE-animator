[Puffy]
Let these Muthafuckaz know (Brooklyn)
We ain't playin(It's my time to shine)
We gonna let B.I.G. live vicariously through us, you feel me?
You don't even know how to spell that shit(get my shit off on Niggaz)
But Cease tell em why it's a long time coming, playa

[Lil' Cease]
Uh...I'ma do the dues I'ma do my thing
Do the dues I'ma do my thing
Do the dues I'ma do my thing
Uh.. yo...yo..yo
It's me y'all Cease a Leo, big spender
Ice rockin criss (where you at nigga?)
I'm at the bar with ten strippers
No niggaz, rock platinum, just avoid gold diggers
I'm here now, guess what, I want it all now
Fuck blazers and roofs, we kick the door down
Beat you in the jaw now, move swift like a coke on a grey hound
Nigga what, it's been a long time comin but it was bound to come
Cause I been doing this shit since day one
Yeah, niggaz talk it but then niggaz walk it
I'ma be in the benz flossin', Look at chicken's crossing
Like vaseline, old school gather deans, uh no exposure in no magazines
Think you can test my team?
Team up boy you still can't match my queen
With a lack of self esteem, foolish pleasure, layed out on a stretcher
Tryin to test the, mic molester, word to my uncle Fester
I put it on y'all B.I.G. warned y'all about the thugz that wrote calls

[Chorus] 
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come 
We been puttin in bidz far too long 
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come 
We been puttin in bidz far too long 
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come 
We been puttin in bidz far too long ...
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come 
We been puttin in bidz far too long ...

[Larceny]
You love them hoez, banga?
Please, bitch call me Mr.Freeze cuz the shit on my neck and my sleeve
Be keepin' zero degreez, when I fuck just a nut in the breeze
Learned from LiL Cease, keep them hoez on they knees
Start to love em then you trickin your cheese
Her and her friend whippin the V and that ain't me
I switch my bitch up bitch up like Jordan in the playoffs 
Switchin his kicks off, you got it mixed up like the hash seeds and 
Sticky greens that I twist up, for me it just be luck
I'm holdin mine jump in the truck, what, just hang a bitch, bang a bitch, 
Leave em in dead, coffin style, bitches love a thug when they smile, uhhh
It's me yo, the poet, street gigolo, mafia dough got plans for this shit to 
blow
Now I want the strip locked with the crack code open, blow, you front?
Be the first to go, you know?

[Chorus] 
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come 
We been puttin in bidz far too long 
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come 
We been puttin in bidz far too long 
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come 
We been puttin in bidz far too long ...
It's been a long time comin but it was bound to come
We been on this shit since day one

[Lil Cease]
Niggaz talk it while I live it, nigga it's so vivid
See when B.I.G. did it, I keep it Jig wit it
These niggaz ain't got enough dough to get wit it
The heart, you can't get it Mr L you wont get it 
Got enough tissue y'all? Cease done shitted
Album done fully submitted and all that dip down long sleeve, fitted hat 
Been doing this since way back, 94, fully newer score
Till 96 when track masters signed the law (what) then I gassed em all 
Launched July 4th now it's top floor, just before the war (which war)
That's bi-coastal, fuck the cast that's vocal, spit the class focal
Watch me blow you, smoke you, fuck you, I dug a bitch but not you (why)
Bigger calmness, Niggaz don't really wanna start shit, it's coming

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come 
We been puttin in bidz far too long 
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come 
We been doin this shit since day one
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come 
We been puttin in bidz far too long ...
It's been a long time comin but it was bound to come
We been doin this shit since day one
It's been a long time comin...bound to come
Doin this shit since day one
It's been a long time comin but it was bound to come
We been puttin in bids far too long </pre>
