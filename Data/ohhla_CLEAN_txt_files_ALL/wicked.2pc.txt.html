Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes

More than an adversary I'm very quick
I'm ready to hit 'em with this gift I'm equipped to kick
So grab your coat and your hat, cause I'm prepared to clown
They're scared of the sound, let's draw these motherfuckers down
Oh shit, 2pacalypse is back and strapped
Attacking the packs, I'm kicking the facts for stacks to rap 
And those that max, relax and let the blacks get jacked
I'm getting taxed, my pack's a pack of angry blacks
I'm ready to go
I'm ripping the shows, hitting the dough, gettin the hoes clothes
Pumping the fo', gangster ho, cause the nose knows
Check the pose, froze, when you see me close
Punks you gonna roast, host, in a cloud of smoke
Choked on some potent dank smoke
Wrote, rhymes that'll bring me bank notes
Nope, I ain't the type of fella that you used to
K-k-kickin the funky flavor for the juice the dope produces
Run for cover when you hear the bass drum
One verse is all it takes; something wicked this way comes

Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes

Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes
wicked, wicked, this way comes
wicked, wicked, this way comes
wicked, wicked, this way comes
Something, wicked, this way comes</pre>
