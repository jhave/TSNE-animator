[M.C. Ren]
Well it be the real niggaz back

but I say fuck 'em, when I buck 'em
its that nigga with the cool and mellow shit 
for your ass takin' niggaz back through the past
all up on my nutz shit be swingin' like a fist

if I did niggaz would cut they wrist
in a muthaphukkin candy 4
beat that ass with the switch 
then blast on the bitch

its that nigga Ren back for the 9-5
they say real niggaz was dead
but this nigga be alive
so I'm puttin' it down wit that nigga E uh-huh

[Chorus]
Tha Muthaphukkin Real
