Chorus: Baby Bash
Excuse me, miss
What's ya name
I don't wanna tell you the same ol' thing
Drop-drop it low
Make-make it pop
I can do this all night, shawty, I don't wanna stop

Break: Baby Bash
I need a go girl
I need a go girl
Go-go girl (GO, GO, GO, GO, Go, GO, GO)
I need a go girl (GO, GO, GO, GO, Go, GO, GO)
I need a go girl

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
I need a
Go girl
Ah, a show girl
Ah, a go-getter-for-cheddar, De-Niro-dope girl
A money-on-the-dance-floor, getting-low girl
Ah, a dro girl with cake that'll make my choke hurl
Cause she a beast in the bed, and I'm a beast with her
Beat it like a champ, and, ah, she re-Twitter
Bash Be Goin' Hard is the headline news
She rockin' the fresh Jays, stilettos and Jimmy Choo's
Black, white y yellow bone, watch 'em with that jelly on
Bringing major fedi home, oooh, what's poppin'
Morena with the honey tone, bringin' daddy money home
Got me ridin' candy chrome, what that do
Shop, shoppin' for a new fist, stuntin' on your boppers
In the DJ booth, giggin' with some punk rockers
She my runnin' back, player, I'm the Quarterback
Send her down to Mexico, she bringin' me the border back

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Break

[Verse 2: E-40]
EW!
She over there hittin' it, she gettin' it
Grinnin' it, grindin' and grittin' it
poppin' it, lockin' it, droppin' and dippin'
Pickin' it up and liftin', never missin' a beat or skippin' it
She know that the fixture's diggin' it
Look at the girl, she kill it
Bad ass booch, big ass kaboose
I'm tryin' to get her drunk, take her to the tele and goose
Spark a phat ass blunt, put a towel under the door
Unplug the smoke detector, get my nut off and then eject her
I'm a Mackaroni, mayne
I don't think y'all understand
I don't pay for pussy, mayne
Pussy pay me, mayne
Fedi stackin' hustler, mayne
All about my rubber bands
Real nigga havin' change, 'bout money (Ew!)
Gotta get my paper right
The (???) up all night
Picture this dough, gettin' my blow, just bought a brand new bike
Lettin' 'em know, used to be poor, I don't care if she [{*dyke*}]
Baby can go, put on the show, she do what I like

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Break

Hook: Baby Bash
California face with a down south romp
California face with a down south romp
California face with a down south romp

California face with a down south romp
California face with a down south romp
California face with a down south romp
Ba-ba-baby girl scrumptious, ew, she dumb
