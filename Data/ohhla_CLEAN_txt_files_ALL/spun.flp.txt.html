[MC Piper]
See we gotta get it right but we always get it wrong
And it be the same old thing and it be the same old song
Tryin' to fight to survive Tryin' to fight for our lives
See I'm only tryin' to live I don't wanna say goodbye
But the day that it all should end Holla back some more that be
Cause we'll all be born again
Maybe then we'll all be free and the day that it all should stop
Is a day that will never come Cause we gonna live forever
Spinnin' until we're spun

[Chorus] (Steve Knight)
Here we go one more time here we go one more time
Now we Spinnin' yeah we spinnin'
Yeah we spinnin' now we spun
Here we go one more time here we go one more time
Now we Spinnin' yeah we spinnin'
Yeah we spinnin' now we spun

[MC Piper]
See we got nowhere to run and we got no where to go
True love is all I need and to never to be alone
So I take a sip and chill while I take a dip and chew
Lookin' for a quick escape but it all wears off too soon
All the girls they love to lie some girls I'll never trust
But it's all a compromise maybe I expect too much
Maybe if I close my eyes maybe then I'll finally see
Maybe then I'll finally die maybe I'll be finally free

[Chorus]

[Steve Knight]
My superstition got me wishin' for another life and if I don't listen
I ain't gonna make it through another night and the pills 'n the caine and
the drink and the drugs got me floating above
And the girls and cash the cars and the hash got me feelin' a rush
A thousand voices in my head I don't know right from wrong
I'm breakin' down holdin' on I'm livin' song to song and Pipe you're my
brother 'till the day that we die
I don't give a fuck who hears me cause
I ain't gonna lie so roll it up pour a cup drink it up smoke it up
I don't give a fuck we bout to blow this shit up

[Chorus]</pre>
