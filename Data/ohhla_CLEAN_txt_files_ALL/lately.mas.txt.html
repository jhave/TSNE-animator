Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Shara Nelson]
Summertime always gives me the blues
Thinking about the things we used to do
Watching lovers in the park making love so free
And now i realize there's only me

Lately baby where, where did we go wrong
[x2]

You been acting like a cat on a hot tin roof
Something's on your mind that you can't share
You never used to hide your feelings from me
Keepin secrets i don't understand

Lately baby where, where did we go wrong
[x2]

I used to synchronize it with your body
Making it so tight never letting go
[x2]

Lately baby where, where did we go wrong
Lately, lately, lately, lately
Lately baby, where did we go wrong
Where did we go wrong
Missed your touch, missed your touch</pre>
