[Verse One]
Silverados, sittin on 60's
Lamborghini do's, just for the bitches

Dodge Magnum, paint it platinum
He got to hear me in it, so it's the fast one
(Is that the brass one?) That is the fast one

Bubble eye Hummer, with the chrome grill
Ask your baby mama, how that leather feel

Brand new 'Vette, with the Calvins
Red and black, same color as the Falcons

63M, check the tag, yessir
Under the hood nigga, it's a geek monster
(Is that a geek monster?) Now that's a geek monster
(IS THAT A GEEK MONSTER?) Now that's a geek monster
Old school Chevy, with the Gucci guts
It's that latter day, I'ma make 'em put it up
(Make 'em put it up) I make 'em put it up
(SHAWTY MAKE THEM PUT IT UP~!) I make 'em put it up
Paint drippin wet, like my girl pussy

[Verse Three]
Every woofer on, I skated on chrome
Just the other day, I got my lights on
(You got yo' lights on?) I got my lights on
(You got yo' lights on?) I got my lights on
20 cars deep, everybody whippin
{?} run the mill, all in them 26's
(Is them those 26's?) Oh them the 26's
(Is them those 26's?) Oh them the 26's
Bubble out bill, with the frog face
Alligator seats, that's how them ballers play
(That's how them ballers play?) That's how them ballers play
(That's how them ballers play?) That's how them ballers play
Old school Chevelle, sittin high as hell
High as hell as I ride through the A-T-L
(Through the A-T-L?) Through the A-T-L
(Ride through the A-T-L?) Through the A-T-L
