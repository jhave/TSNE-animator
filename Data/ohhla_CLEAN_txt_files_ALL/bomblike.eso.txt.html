Song:   Bomb Like Banksy
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, I want it and they need it. I stay on it, it's no secret
So I talk you through telekinesis then bomb like Banksy, you better believe it
I want it and they need it. I stay on it, it's no secret
So I talk you through telekinesis then bomb like Banksy, you better believe it

Yo, see I did it for you, I did it for myself, I did it for the crew
And when we did it is was felt being phony is the only fucking image that'll sell
In a room full of mirrors taking pictures of yourself
So I hit em with the belt like Pooty Tang
Tell him pull your finger out and introduce my gang
MC's, R Freaks, DJs, dreamers, story tellers
trickers that preach that freedom
Smokers, painters, lovers of the music
your fam, your clan, the hussle for improvement
The lives, the lies, the roof's on fire
set that stage ablaze and crush crews all night
I'm that little bugger with a boombox bangin
If ya can't hang better move on madame
cause every moment is honestly magic
like South Park writers at the Oscars on acid

I want it and they need it. I stay on it, it's no secret
So I talk you through telekinesis then bomb like Banksy, you better believe it
I want it and they need it. I stay on it, it's no secret
So I talk you through telekinesis then bomb like Banksy, you better believe it

As a kid, shit I liked to challenge what my limit is
And with that pencil, used to draw a lot of images
Now I draw on the mental with the pencil
but it's the words that writes that serve the paint what the picture is
The lyricist in art is like autumn is fall
so these songs are like the drawings that we don on the wall
Cast the erase spray in Jonathan's view mode
breakin out the silence like the wall is a cruso
Blue ocean, hungry, orange box and bungee
There and back again, it's like hopscotch in country
My crew's on the move in one jet we're flyin
with my sights set on that sunset horizon
Sippin sake with Mr. Miyagi, droppin crane he can knock you out, wisdom of Ghandi
Facin my fears head on, so I'm into the fray
When it's black and I'm white it's like the end of the grey, let it play

I want it and they need it. I stay on it, it's no secret
So I talk you through telekinesis then bomb like Banksy, you better believe it [x4]</pre>
