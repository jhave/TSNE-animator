[Hook: Nas Sample: "You're Da Man"] X2
If I, ever make a record
I'll take a check and put something
away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, but look at me now

[Intro: KRS-One]
Here we go, yo, yea, KRS in the building
Marley Marl, whuttup, Marley Marl, yea, look up

[Verse One: KRS-One]
Yo Nas, this KRS shouting you out
B.R.O.N.X. I couldn't make it to the jam
to be live on your set
But take these sixteen as a sign of my respect
You're Illmatic and you still got it
The crown of Hip-Hop, there's still time you could still grab it
Don't be distracted by them faggots
You still fly, they remain maggots
Nas, you will not lose
Your contribution to Hip-Hop makes you the top two
And with KRS, we're the top two
These mothafuckas find themselves laid out on FOX news
Yo Nas, Hip-Hop can't be dead, you brought it back
With the words you said, you are Hip-Hop fo'real
And that shit between you and Jada, y'all gots to chill

[Hook: Nas Sample: "You're Da Man"] X2

[Interlude: KRS-One]
We're all brothers, we're all brothers, rise up, Hip-Hop
Nas you're the man, word up, Hip-Hop, One Nation
Big up, from the Bronx, to Queensbridge, Marley Marl in the house
Come together, rock on, Bronx, Queensbridge come together

[Verse Two: KRS-One]
Uh, you brought Queensbridge back
And like my man Fat Joe, you made the Bronx lean back
Nastradamus I seen that
You was a heavier times then man, a Prophet, I mean that
People ask where's Dr. King's dream at?
I think it's Hip-Hop, we already seen that
Yo Marley, I know you're in the building
Yo Kelis, I know you're there chilling
Shout-out to the Queen on the scene
Hip Hop is Dead I know what you mean
I seen Hip-Hop die about five times already
But yet, we still rock steady
Stay ready, we're about to resurrect career, the real, fo'real
They gon' feel the steel
K.R.S. - N.A.S., North, South, East, West

[Hook: Nas Sample: "You're Da Man"] X3

[Outro: KRS-One]
Congratulations, you gon' do it this year
Hip-Hop come together, it's real, we're one family
Fuck all these beefing and shit
We're one family, let's come together, word up
Rock on, Marley Marl, another house for hits production

[Nas Sample: "You're Da Man"
I'm the N the A to the S I R
I'm the N the A to the S I R
I'm the N the A to the S I R
I'm the N the A to the S I R

Fresh for 2007, you suckers..</pre>
