Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth

Hop up out the bed, turn my swag on
Pay no attention to them haters
Because we whip 'em off
And we ain't doin' nothin' wrong
So don't tell me nothin'
I'm just trying to have fun
So keep the party jumping
So what's up? (yeah)
And now they don't know what to do
We turn our back and whip our hair and just
Shake em off, shake em off
Shake em off, shake em off

Don't let haters get me off my grind
Keep my head up, I know I'll be fine
Keep fighting until I get there
When I'm down and I feel like giving up

[Chorus]
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth

Imma get more shine in a little bit
Soon as I hit the stage applause
I'm hearing it
Whether is black stars, black cars
I'm feelin it
But can't none of them whip it like I do (I)
I get to the mm-yeah go hard
When they see me pull up
I whip it real hard
I whip it real hard
Real hard
I whip it real hard

Don't let haters get me off my grind
Keep my head up, I know I'll be fine
Keep fighting until I get there
When I'm down and I feel like giving up

[Chorus]
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth

All my ladies if you feel it
Gone and do it, do it
Whip your hair (whip your hair)
Don't matter if it's long, short
Do it, do it whip your hair!

All my ladies if you feel it
Gone and do it, do it
Whip your hair (whip your hair)
Don't matter if it's long, short
Do it, do it whip your hair, your hair, your hair!

[Chorus]
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth</pre>
