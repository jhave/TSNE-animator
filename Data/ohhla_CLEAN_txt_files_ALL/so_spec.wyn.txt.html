[Intro: John Legend]
Ohhhhhh, ohh-ohh
So special, you're so special {*2X*}
Ohhhhh ohhhhh, whoahhhhhh
So special, you're so special {*2X*}

[Lil Wayne]
Uhhh! Boy shorts, wife beater
Now let me see it, I'm a sightseer
She was sleepin on me, but she's a light sleeper
I make her cum first, then I follow the leader
I talk shit, I hope it matters
We climax, without the ladder
Can't desert the future, no Nevada
Her body is a weapon, rat-a-tat her
I spent the night in heaven I slept with an angel
And when we finish I swear that pussy said, thank you"
I said "You're very welcome," I'm so well mannered
And I go down South, Louisiana

[Chorus: John Legend]
Baby won't you spend the night
Darling I don't want to wake up and you are not by my side
So special, you're so special {*2X*}
And if you promise me tonight, yeah
Baby that you'll let me in then, I'ma make you feel so special girl
So special, you're so special {*2X*}
Ohhhhhhhhhh!

[Lil Wayne]
Then we take a shower together and wash each other's back
And if she kick it off, I'ma run it back
And then she say my name, like I forgot it
She crazy about that dick, Lorena Bobbitt
Love be the pilot, but it's kamikaze
Yeah body language, girl let's talk about it
Freedom of speech, Weezy a beast
Open her up like a book, read it and weep

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
So special, yeah
Thinkin 'bout you girl got my mind on E
You know them other niggaz ain't me
Girl I got that 12 Play for ya, that 12 Play for ya
Just sit on my grill, that's that tailgate for ya
I, put it together, common denominator
I tear it up like loose leaf paper
I got drinks on chill, my bedroom huge
I knock her lights out; I blow her fuse
See we don't even fuck no mo', we make love
And now she's on the tip of my tongue, my taste buds
Heh cause she my honey bee, yeah buzz buzz
And now I'm itchin and scratchin, that's that love bug

[Chorus]

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I promise
That I got that 12 Play for ya, that 12 Play for ya
The 12 Play for ya</pre>
