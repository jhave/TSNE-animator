Remix... Come on

(Female voices)
I said hey, you, need to holla at these boys
These boys called Jim Crow
Fucking niggas known worldwide
With a car full of hefers inside

[Verse 1]
When I'm on Candler road, girls holla like, (AHHHHHHHH)
Oh yeah that's me
In a big boy truck on them' 23's
When my boys burn it down you gon' need +Febreez+
Girl, go get my money off the motherfucking streets say, (AHHHHHHHH)
Yes, I should jack your knees
Now, In high school I was an absentee
Cuz I was at the skip party spiking Daqaris
Big player, she on her knees begging me like prayer (AHHHHHHHH)
I get the money start living life well,
Kinda country and my bank gon' stay fuzzy
And my pockets stay plushy, holla at me
Better yet, swallow at me
SO many hoes go (AHHHHHHHH) choppin' at me (chop chop) we sucking
Niggas can't copy-cat me
You can find me on Ralph David Abernathy
Bitches bumpin' like acne, come on

[Chorus]
Holla at a playa when you see me on the street trick, (AHHHHHH)
Yeaaa, holla at playa, holla at a playa,

All the ladies in the house say, (AHHHHHH)
Keep my name out your mouth like last night
I hit that ass right
We was ballin' them broads, we in cash right
I had em jumpin on my thing like a trampoline, she said, (AHHHHHH)
You having fun, girl you need a drink?
I'm loving that wet pink
On the bathroom floor up against the sink
Baby, baby

Holla at a playa when you see me on the street trick

[Verse]
No dogg, next morning rolled over like, (AHHHHHH)
Hit this girl with the ball on the wall, bed in all (what)
Pulling on my shirt while I'm signing her bra
Cuttin' in the kitchen (what) cuttin' in the den

Got to ride rims, bumpin' Youngbloodz
Get your boy, I got the guaranteed cut, guaranteed cut
