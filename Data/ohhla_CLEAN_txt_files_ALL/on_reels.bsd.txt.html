	"All these crab niggas know the deal" (Repeat 3x)
           "On the reels"

It's like, herbs and crabs everywhere
People pissing on my album, yo I just didn't care
They couldn't understand, I couldn't comprehend
These homeboys stopped calling me, we are not friends
Yeah I do guest spots with rappers and write joints for Victor Wooten
I'm disputing your cash Stash like Rasputin
Pure Bliss like Melvin, are all the reasons MFing
I'm the king, y'all brothers is getting vicked for your publishing
A lotta you rappers out here remind me of Stan Musial
You're good at what you do but it's not musical
I'm not mystical but I might confuse a few
You need to know that I'm much better than you
Better credit than you, greener letters than you
You and your crew coming through, ain't to do but do
You ain't gonna scare me into liking you
Real thugs don't rap, they key it up, t'all niggas is Theodore
Uh! Your broad is a fraud, she be hitting rappers since
Latin Quarters, Wild Style, and Style Wars
Brothers be losing their life to have mass appeal
You keep it real on the streets, keep it real on the reels

	"All these crab niggas know the deal" (Repeat 3x)
           "On the reels"

Hey, DJ Premier rap talent, y'all act like you don't know
Buckwild for self, y'all put it on at the Show
I nut on y'all beats, but this ain't JuJu
Crazy likes Legs but I Rocks-Steady on your crew
Y'all on that Glamour and Glitz
While I'm all up in your ear like Q-Tip's doing a remix
This is nothing for the radio, y'all labels won't jock me
Fuck the music biz, I want my name with a marquee
This is soul food, "Get Off That Bullshit" please
I want extra greens, I brough Extra-P's
So keep on yapping, I'll just wait til you're finished
I'm still an A-sharp simmer, you a F-flat diminish

	"All these crab niggas know the deal" (Repeat 3x)
           "On the reels"

Rappers in videos and magazines sitting at the keys, but can't find Middle C
They seem to think cause they be wilding in the streets
They can fall off in the studio and make the illest beats
As if it ain't no talent involved
I've been in Tenessee 8 years and still ain't scared of none of y'all
Hey, Count Bass and I will never fall
You keep it real on the streets, keep it real on the reels

	"All these crab niggas know the deal" (Repeat 3x)
           "On the reels"
        "Word to mother, heard 'em fronting"</pre>
