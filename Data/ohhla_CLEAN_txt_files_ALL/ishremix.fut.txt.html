Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Future]
Talking 'bout you popping tags, nigga you ain't bought shit
Talking bout a hunned bottles, nigga you ain't popped shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga you ain't fuck shit

[Verse 1: Drake]
Took niggas out the hood like I'm from there
So you know it's all good when I come there
I hear you talk about your city like you run that
And I brought my tour to your city, you my son there nigga
But I had to come through for the remix
On my havenât done a verse in 8 weeks shit
And if a nigga say my name, he the hot shit
But if I say the nigga name, he still the hot shit
Fucked up, lucky I don't feed into the gossip
Niggas act like they don't know, but they should know
Yeah, I just think it's funny how they dangling the bait
But I'm the one that's killing niggas on the hooks though
And niggas ain't got a grill, still ice grill hating
I know y'all already know Mike Will Made It
Just looking at the numbers, nigga, I feel amazing
I call Michael Jordan up and Mike will make it
I'm the young rap nigga with the 'Melo deal
You need to come to OVO for a better deal
Just know a million ain't shit once you get a mill
And niggas say itâs all good, thatâs how you better feel
Nigga nah, fuck that, this year I'm talking big stuff
Rolling through the city like a young nigga bricked up
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That's why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
If money talk then your pockets ain't saying shit
I'm in the bathroom getting head from your bitch
And I ain't paying her shit
You want beef? You don't know who you playing with
I tell my pilot to land the jet
I'm hopping off, get 'em, we popping off
Give a click and you niggas dead where you standing at
I'm just a trippy nigga smoking on cabbage
Your money funny like Jim Carrey
I got bitches that's super bad like Halle
And we still keeping that white like Barry
I'm a rich nigga, still keep a pistol with me
Nigga you ain't fuckin' with a picture of me
I got all this cake and shooters with me
Just in case you pussy niggas try to get you a piece
What it is, my nigga? What it's hittin' for?
Where the car you were whippin' in the video?
Where is the ice at? Where is them pretty hoes?
You a fraud, real niggas already know
Broke ass niggas I can't stand them
I hit 'em with the cannon
I buying out the mall at random
Juicy J that nigga is fresh to death
Smoke till there is nothing left
Bail off and then I'm ghost in my Phantom</pre>
