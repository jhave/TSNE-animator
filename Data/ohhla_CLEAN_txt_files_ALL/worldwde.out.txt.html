[2Pac]
Known for doing skandalouz deeds
No handlin' me
And naw it aint the drugs
Just the straight thug nigga in me
I swoop down and cause havoc
My rapid delivery is automatic
Lettin' niggaz have it
I been labeled as a thug nigga
Since they dont sell my shit to white folks
Ship it to the drug dealers
And catch'a-catch'a nigga world-wide
A fuckin Mobb Figga... West Coast hoo-ride
When we robb niggaz
Money made my squad bigger
But we aint sell our souls
Bustin' on our emenies, muder my foes
At my shows Imma nut
Lights, camera, time for action
Now get to clappin' to my cuts
A World Wide Mobb Figga

[T-Low - Chorus]
This is for thugz in every state
We know that bustaz gonna hate tonite
And World Wide
Aint no place that we rather be
Livin' it up with the family tonite
And World Wide

[Napoleon]
It's so hard on me
Girl pardon me
I got the same spirit Pac had
Hit 'em to me
When I arrive on the dance floor
I'm humpin' the floor
It's a world wide mobb thang
That's for sure
Got money in my pocket now
Drivin' in a rocket now
Never hear me rap around ice
I keep it underground
