[Intro]
[Girl]         Mr. Mike, can you give some money to get my hair done?
[Mr. Mike] What's wrong with your hair right now?
[Girl]        Well, you know I get it done every week, and I need my nails done too
[Mr. Mike] Look, I'ma tell you like this

[Verse 1: Mr. Mike]
I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt
See, I'm from the street, so I know what's up
On these silly games that's played by the women
I'm only happy when I'm goin' up in them
Yo, but you know, I ain't no GIMMIE THIS society
But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
So I step to them, with aggression
Listen to the kid, and learn a lesson today
See, they think we narrow minded
Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded
So I walk over and say: How you're doin?
See, I'm only want some lootin'
But you know, ugh, you gots to play it off cool
Cause if they catch you slippin, yo, you'll get schooled
And they'll get you for your money, son
Next thing you know, you're gettin their hair and they nails done
Fool, and they'll let you show them off
But when it comes to sex and gettin' wet, they got a bad cough
Or a headache, it's all give and no take
Run out of money, you look dummy, and watch your heart break
They'll drop you like a bad habit
But a nigga with money, yo, you gotta have it
Fuckin' with me though, they gets none
You can't juice Mr. Mike baby girl, cause I ain't the one

[Chorus: Mr. Mike]
I ain't the one, I'm livin' life on the run
We might not have fun baby but what's done is done
I ain't the one, maybe in due time you'll see
That this thing with you and me, just wasn't meant to be
I ain't the one, too busy livin' life on the run
You might not have fun honey, but what's done is done
I ain't the one, maybe in due time you'll see
That this thing with you and me, just wasn't meant to be

[Verse 2: Mr. Mike]
Yo, sometimes I used to wonder
How the fuck an ugly nigga get a fine bitch's number?!
He's gettin juiced for his ducats
I tell a girl in a minute, yo, I drive a bucket
And won't think nothin' of it
She can ride or walk, either leave it or love it
I show her that I'm not the O-the-N-E
Say: I'm a straight up N-I double-G A
Cause I'm gamin' on a female that's gamin' on me
You know, I spell girl with a B
A brother like me is only out for one thing
I think with a stackin' cream
But I won't bring no flowers to her doorstep when we goin' out
Ha, cause you'll take it for granted, I guess, no doubt
And after the date, I'ma want to do the wild thing
You want lobster huh?  I'm thinkin' Chicken wing
And when I take you, you'll get frustrated
You can't juice Mr. Mike girl and you hate it
But you see, I don't go nuts
No, over girls like you with the big old butts
It start comin' out the pocket, to knock it
Cause when the damage is done
Ugh, you can only pay me girl, you can't play me girl
For the simple fact that, I ain't the one

[Chorus: Mr. Mike w/ Variations]
I ain't the one, I'm livin' life on the run
We might not have fun hon' but what's done is done
I ain't the one, maybe in due time you'll see
That this thing with you and me, just wasn't meant to be
I ain't the one, too busy livin' life on the run
You might not have fun baby, but what's done is done
I ain't the one, maybe in due time you'll see
That this thing with you and me, just wasn't meant to be

[Girl] Can I have some money, pleeeease?

[Verse 3: Mr. Mike]
Give you money while I bother
Cause you know, I'm lookin' nothin' like your father
Girl, I can't be played or ganked
Uh uh, ganked means gettin' took for your bank
Or your gold, or your money, or somethin'
Nine times out of ten, bitches givin' up nothin'
They just mad when I put it in perspective
But let's see, if my knowledge is effective
To the brothers man, they robbin' you blind
Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind
Keep your money to yourself homie
And if you got enough game
You'll get her name and her number
Without going under
You can't leave them, and love and stay above them
I used to get no play, now she's stayin' mentions this
Cause I heard I had a mansion in Texas
But I lied and played the one
Just to get some now she feels dumb
To my niggaz it's funny
Ugh, but that's what you get tryin' to play my boy's money
Now, don't you feel used?
But I don't give hoot, huh, because I knock boots
You shouldn't be, so damn material
And try to milk Mr. Mike like cereal
How many times do I have to say it?
Cause if I have to go get a gun, I'ma spray it
You girls will learn, uhh, I don't burn
You think I'm a sucker, what?, but I ain't the one

[Chorus: Mr. Mike w/ Variations]
I ain't the one, I'm livin' life on the run
We might not have fun baby but what's done is done
I ain't the one, maybe in due time you'll see
That this thing with you and me, just wasn't meant to be
I ain't the one, baby, I'm livin' life on the run
You might not have fun sugar, but what's done is done
I ain't the one, maybe in due time you'll see
That this thing with you and me, just wasn't meant to be

[Outro: Mr. Mike]
I ain't the one, nigga
Ugh, peace to that nigga Ice Cube
Mr. Mike in this motherfucker</pre>
