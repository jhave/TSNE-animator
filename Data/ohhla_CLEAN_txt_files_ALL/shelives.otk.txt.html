[Intro: Rosario Dawson]
{*laughter*}
What's wrong?? What are you afraid of??
The Love Below

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
She stays alone, never sheds a single tear
She stays in the coolest moods, clearly woman of the year
She and all her girlfriends, they go out dressed to win
She comes back to the cooler side of town
but she lives in my lap

[Chorus: Andre 3000]
She lives in my lap {*repeat 6X*}
Forever my fiance
She lives in my lap
Don't need no chain
She lives in my lap
I'll get the courage one day

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Make me want you, make me miss you
make me wonder where you are, then forget you
Girl remind me, just who we are
We're oh so close, but yet so far

[Interlude]
Rosario Dawson: Baby why are you acting like this??
                I don't care about any of them...
                I care about you!
                Baby I love you!

Andre 3000: You've got me open wide (I love you)
            Just Come inside (baby)
            It's yours (it's yours)
            I'm yours (I'm yours)
            For sure (for sure)
            Play baby play...

[Chorus] + [interlude] + {*scratching*} til fade...</pre>
