Lil Flipper da Leprachun ak da Freestyle King
Sucka Free, Fuckin wit dat Ron-C on dat Dodo tshhh
Nigga ya'll blowin bull shit, Endo nigga dats what we blow

We blow endo, I might be on Jay Leno
They be like Flip can you listen to my demo?
I say nah nigga I got shows to do
After the Concert I got ho's to screw
If I'm on stage I don't want to be close to you
I got money nigga I aint gonna boast to you
What I'm supposed to do is keep rappin
Some niggas got gold in they mouth
I got Platnium, I aint Cappin
What Happened? I done blew up to quick
I'm Lil' Flip the Freestyle King of the Screwed Up Click
I represent, I get head
Ride Blue, Ride Black, I Ride Red
Fuck-a Fed, I shake heads when I'm in the Club
Ball out of control, I got endo dub Sacks
How you love dat?
I ain't the Hot boys 
but you might see me in a Drop Top Boy
I wear Rolex, I got Baggets, Princess Cuts
If I'm in the club you'll see me pimpin Sluts
Dats what I do, nigga all the time
Get ro-tation on 97 point 9, dats the box
Nigga got a TV sitcom on Fox
Used to be on blocks slangin rocks
Now I'm changin Dots, In my Drop Top Prowler
Goto court throw away the case I got a Prowler
A Caller, nigga Caller I.D., I balla I be
She wanna fuck? I'm gonna caller and see
Take dat ho to Motel 6 and goto Tweeties
Pour a deuce in a can, Sold a four in Tahati
Now I'm leanin, nigga I'm in a green Beamer
Super Duper fly like I'm Missy Mesdemeanor
I'm Lil Flip, nigga I know you know me
Baggets in 30 corners all on my Role(x)
You might see me, In an Expedition
With a sign on da back that says lets go fishin
I'm a balla, nigga I told you that, If I ain't ridin green
then I'm rollin lac, I'm from the Clover, I'm a Soldier
I write rhymes in my folder, Hell ya I got more crystals then Foldgers
Dats coffee, Ho's wanna toss me, get off me
Cuz I be ballin out of control, Ho's they stalk me
From your Walkie, My Nextel, Inhale, Exhale
Half of my niggaz locked up in jail
But I'm still on da block puttin it down
Nigga when I smile, bling, Platnium puttin- you got a frown
You be mad, Cuz you see me in a Drop Top Jag
50 G's for a car is not that bad, I can Do that
If its to fast I can screw that
Get the brand new Drop, Royal Blue dat
Now I'm Cruisin, Nigga-Niggaz I be bruisin
Gettin all them mad, Cuz at the club I be Choosin
I like Yellow Bones, Talk on Prime Co Telephones
Got Ho's from Hirame Clark to Yellow Stone
I'm in Homestead Chillin with the real niggaz
We wearin Platnium Fubu, ya'll still wear Fil-Hil-Figer
I almost fucked up but nigga I'm the King
I can freestyle all night untill the door bell ring
And all I do is ride on chrome, and all I got is DVDz inside my home
I got a Jacooze, I might watch Scary Movie
Hell ya I get head from yo mamma every Tuesday
This Lil' Flip, I bet you know that, Show that
Hell ya you owe me some money, nigga you owe that
So pay me, The Radio gonna play me 
Look at my yard I got more toys then Kay Bee
Who I am? da Leprachun Freestyle King
Change da color of my teeth and my Bezeltine
Now I'm Platnium, nigga got a nigga name Crime
Open up my mouth, my piece shine, but Jhonny got me blindin
Got me just parallel park
When I open up my mouth it farwell to the dark
I sip drank, Flip tanks, Sip Eights
Ya'll ho's in Worthin, Sterlin, and Yates
and when I pick'em up, nigga I'm gonna take'em to the room
Nigga I'm gonna be the witch and you can ride my broom
Then you gone, I freestyle, I'm off da dome
I got all satellites on the top of my home
I get gone in my zone nigga, I'm in a Bently 
Niggaz mad they got Guess glasses, I'm wearin Fently in S-Classes
Jumpin out, nigga the King
Fuck ya'll nigga I'm jumpin out Limosuine
