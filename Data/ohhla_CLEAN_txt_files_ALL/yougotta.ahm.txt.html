[ VERSE 1 ]
Everybody in the ghetto tell me... 
Is it a lie that I must be a ruffneck
And wear a frown just to be down?
I kinda don't agree with bein (tough)
But you gotta be (rough)
It's either you claimin your hood, or you're not a gee
Forget about respect, I refuse to be the next guy
Fitted for a casket, either with it, or get blasted
I choose to gangbang, they give me a chrome-plated trigger
Say, "If you got any heart, go rob that Mini-Mart, nigga"
Now look what I done did, damn, I had to be the big man
They're lookin at me shifty, better shut up 'fore I get slammed
Man, I'm not a thief, good grief, and I don't wanna act hard
But then they said if I didn't do it, they was gonna gat, far
As I could see (I was gonna be)
The next new member of the crew, cause it's 8 of them and 1 of me
I don't wanna do it, but I will 
Cause I still want folks to think that I'm hard and tough
Cause you gotta be (rough)
Cause you gotta be (tough)
Cause you gotta be (rough)
(I used to be a stick-up kid)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Well, it's the niggeroe, again, right back in where I left off
Still tryin to make a decision, I might go to prison if I don't step off
But if I don't rob this store, then I'm not sure
If I'm gonna be considered as a gee
And you gotta be (rough)
Cuffs are temporary, homies are for life
So I grab the deuce-deuce and go inside
I decide to prove in the Mini-Mart, "Don't nobody move
Start fillin up the paper sack with loot, or I might shoot"
But things didn't go as planned, cause this man had his own gun
We're standin toe to toe, eye to eye, so I figured why not 
Pull the trigger? Put this nigga on the ground
It'll show that I had poise, then my boy'll know I'm down
But I didn't do it quick enough, or he thought of it first
Cause he blasted to the chest, and now I'm restin yellin, "Nurse!"
And holdin on to life, or at least tryin to hold on
In a jailward wearin cuffs
Cause I had to be (rough)
Cause you gotta be (tough)
Cause you gotta be (rough)
(I used to be a stick-up kid)

And everybody, everybody gotta be rough, y'all
(I used to be a stick-up kid)
And everybody, everybody gotta be tough, y'all
(I used to be a stick-up kid)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Well, that's the end of my tale, but before we know
Fools'll just forget what I said, and the story go
On and on, until you're up to no good
And back throwin up your hood 
And still doin what you shouldn't 
Niggeroes, come together, cause divided we fall
So stall that gang shit, stand up
Quit standin in handcuffs 
Really hard's when you got loot 
And you ain't gotta shoot
Damn man, enough is enough 
So why you gotta be (rough)
Cause you gotta be (tough)
Cause you gotta be (rough)
