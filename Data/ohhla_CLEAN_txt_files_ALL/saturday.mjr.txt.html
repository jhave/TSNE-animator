[Major James]
(Verse 1)
Saturday mornin'
Just wakin' up
Still kind of high, still kind of drunk (Kind of drunk)
I turned on the shower
A text on my phone
We're meeting at the park
Once again, it's on
Now I was drivin' in a (???) freshly fitted
Oooh, Era hat
Matchin' goats to go with it
And I hop in my old school (Old school)
I'm so cool (So cool)
When I'm sittin' all day in the day
I'm on my way

Chorus: Major James
Get up, it's really on
In a
Major way
Everybody's callin' my phone
I said, "I'm
On my way"
I'm on my way
In a old school with the radio on (They're playing my song)
It's a
Beautiful day (Beautiful day)
Got a barbecue, goin' on
I said, "I'm
On my way"
I'm on my way

[Rap Verse: Baby Bash]
I'm on my way, way, high as a ray, gaye
Saturday's lovely girl, cause Friday was pay day
With no further delay, lay
I'm scoopin' up day, day
In a drop Chevrolet (Hey)
Smokin' on grade A
Grade A
Someone beamin' on my cap in the turnin' lane
Candy paint, lookin' wetter than a hurricane
Another cleaner than this beamer on the B's and Q's
Called up
Louie, Louie, got the trees and brew
I got a game to top-notch in
Timer like diamond watches
Just waitin' for a player's call
Get out, your iPhone and listen to Cyclone
Baby girl, we gon' do it all

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Pulled up to the car, it's on and crackin'
Dominoes at the table, you know what's happenin'
See shawty over there, she's the main attraction
Lookin' over my way, like she's 'bout the action
You know what I want, and I'm out to come get it
So write down your number and your name to go get it
I'm so cool (So cool)
You know who (You know who)
When I'm sittin' all day in the day
I'm on my way

Hook: Major James
All my peoples kickin' back on a Saturday
Around the way, everything is all good
Barbecue grill on a sunny day
And if you ain't knowin' nobody, you should
Summertime
Everything's right
And it's about to go down
The honies all around
Tonight, the Saturday in my hood

Repeat Chorus
