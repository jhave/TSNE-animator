Party people are you with me? (Cool J)
Party people are you with me? (Cool J)
Party people are you with me? (Cool J)
Party people are you with me? (Cool J, uh)
Party people are you with me? (Cool J)
Party people are you with me? (Cool J)
Party people are you with me? (Cool J)

Newcomers, step on back and if you hid last summer
catch a heart-attack, cause I'm back
I'm bad, you write rhymes made are blad
I'm mad cause they said I wasn't bad
No recognition cause they said I'm from the ghetto
Carryin' nine millimeters and stiletto's
I guess I need a TV show to get mine
But I don't feel like kissin' no director's behind
That's too soft for L
I'ma write a rhyme-fighter inside of the rebel "Yell"
Hour jack loops and dancer troops
Watch out for the gangsta-machine-gun-loose

(Chorus: LL Cool J)
Ain't no stoppin' this
Nah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this
Nah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this
No way, huh, ain't no stoppin' this
Nah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this
Never, ever, no, ain't no stoppin' this
Nah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this
Nah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this

(LL Cool J)
Last year pop rappers got awards
And don't know a damn thing about a block party mic-cord
They see LL, they know the brothers' real
But the flies can tell you exactly how they feel
When I come in the door it's like I'm made of dynamite
I gotta blow up more and more
Shakin' the rafters from here on after
Puttin' an end to all the laughter
There ain't no way they can win
with the band all in, plus the turntable spin
Strip-searchin' competition, you can call 'em competition
but there ain't no competition cause I'm on a mission
I'ma rip this game, I want the soul train families and anybody with a name
Superstars step aside this year
And all you other little crumbs that wanna try and come near
I'm sick and tired of political setbacks
Too much red tape-the-box, so forget that

(Chorus: LL Cool J)
Ain't no stoppin' this
Ain't no stoppin' this
Ain't no stoppin' this
I'm comin', huh, ain't no stoppin' this
Nah, ain't no stoppin' this
Nuh-uh, no, ain't no stoppin' this
Never, ever, no, ain't no stoppin' this
Nah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this, don't stop

(LL Cool J)
Party people are you with me? (Cool J)
Party people are you with me? (Cool J)
Party people are you with me? (Cool J, hah)
Party people are you with me? (Cool J, uh)
Party people are you with me? (Cool J, uh)
Party people are you with me? (Cool J, yeah)
Party people are you with me? (Cool J, uh)
Party people are you with me? (Cool J)

(LL Cool J)
I started in the basement of my grandmother's house
My rap got gashed, your whole body's' gettin' doubts
Burnt to a crisp, lead from the mist
Third degree and Gods' my only witness
When I shocked the world, hold the prince hostage
for the diamonds and pearls
Maker-Mike will remember the time
tellin' Madonna black love ain't a crime
I'm like a shogun, I ain't scared of no-one
Born and raised in New York, that's where I come from

(Chorus: LL Cool J)
Ain't no stoppin' this
Nah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this
Nah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this
Never, ever, no, ain't no stoppin' this
Uh, come on, hah, ain't no stoppin' this
Nah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this
Nah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this
Never, ever, no, ain't no stoppin' this

(Yeah, uh, hah, yeah)

(LL Cool J)
I rip downtown, uptown
I love the way the bass sound, when I'm underground
Boulevard to boulevard, avenue to avenue, I'll be havin' you
Playin' a scene to a song so mean that'll get
your whole car rockin' like a war machine
Neighbors downstairs call current-affairs
Cause the party got ripped and yours truly was there

(Chorus/Outro: LL Cool J)
Ain't no stoppin' this
1984, ain't no stoppin' this
1985, ain't no stoppin' this
1986, ain't no stoppin' this
1987, ain't no stoppin' this
1988, ain't no stoppin' this
1989, ain't no stoppin' this
1990, ain't no stoppin' this
91, ain't no stoppin' this
92, what to do?

1993 and all that, infinity, power of God rules</pre>
