[Intro-Rock]
Yeah! Let 'em know, son

[Verse 1-Buckshot]
Listen, we stomp through so many rap wars and rap awards
Boot Camp Clik been on your front line blastin' off
And hardly got props for it, I saw it
Even though we never got big, we never stopped short
Ugh, 'Pac saw it, that's right, called us
To form One Nation on the world to see more of us
Now we on the grind in the tour bus
With a Ill Mind and behind me is the fortress
You know, a few bro's with flows
That's off the meat rack, seven to be exact
BD, he in the back, plottin' the plan
To show you difference between a pot and a pan
And the reason why I'm not in the can
'Cause I be with them brothers holdin' it down, 'til they Last Stand
And, I'll be the Black Marolla Ruran
'Cause when I get on, you know I'm puttin' on my fam, listen

[Chorus: Rock]
Let's Go, Let's Go, here we go (Let's Go)
Let's Go, Let's Go, here we go (Let's Go)
Let's Go, Let's Go, here we go (Here we go)
Here we go (Here we go) Let's Go (Let's Go)
Let's Go, Let's Go, here we go (Let's Go)
Let's Go, Let's Go, here we go (Let's Go)
Let's Go, Let's Go, here we go (Here we go)
Here we go (Here we go) Let's Go (Let's Go)

[Verse 2-Sean Price]
P! Yo, y'all niggas act tough like Bokine Woodbine
Until you get slapped like Penny from Good Times
Sean Price got too many hood rhymes
But keep gettin' knocked, I did so many hood crimes
It looks like a job for Superman
Up, up and away, then gun buck with the trey
Conversatin', congregatin', I got twelve disciples
They all got rifles and neh' one of 'em like you, Let's Go

[Verse 3-Steele]
You nah' wan' rump with this sick soldier, four-fifth holder
Talk tough, gun blast, nigga, guya de la boca
Lamb toaster, Sam Sosa, business half-owner
Rap quote 'll slap you in your hangin' poster
You don't wanna throw your 'bows up
Body blows 'll make you fold up
Slow your role up, don't get your face swolled up
Bring your best arms, Kevlar vest on, step wrong
Get stretched when the sket's roar, Let's Go

[Chorus]

[Verse 4-Starang Wondah]
Here we go (Here we go) Here we go (Here we go)
Here we go, here we go, here we, here we, here we go
BCC and I'm Strang One (One)
Dum-ditty-dum-ditty-ditty-dum-dum
My talon is gettin' violent
Y'all don't say shit, y'all just be silent
Like Jill Scott, don't worry 'bout what Will got
'Cause bein' nosy could get that ass shot
Tek-N-Steele, the generals, BDI the boss
Duck Down paid the cost, y'all niggas is lost
Da Incredible Rap Team rolls with the force
I'm the greatest entertainer Dru-Ha came across
Toss the keys to E&amp;J, get in the 'Lac
He drivin', Will gonna sit in the back
That's the 'Ville, that's real, B-O-S-S
Stomp through the East Coast then the West next
Bitches that we meet say we got the best sex
We grimy, even though we stay the best list
Don't blame me for bein' a Foxx like Jamie
Be angry, but I'm with who you came to see, so

[Chorus]

[Starang Wondah]
Here we go (uh-huh) Here we go (uh-huh)
Here we go, here we go, here we, here we, here we go

[Outro]
Ladies and gentlemen, the illustrious and praiseworthy Ill Mind, for that ass
Ladies and gentlemen, Mister Ill Mind, ladies and gentlemen, Mister Ill Mind</pre>
