[INTRO]
I'm a cold world hustler nigga, HEY!
I'm a cold world hustler nigga, HEY!
I'm a cold world hustler nigga, HEY!
Stuck in a cold world, HEY!

[Verse 1: E-Sick]
I'm a cold world havoc in the traffic cause I can't get loose
Eighty proof gin and juice keep me crunk for you fools
If niggas still don't understand the shit that I'm goin' through
I'm thinkin' crazed thoughts but killers don't talk
Strapped up wrapped up all in myself
I'm on a paperchase cause I ain't goin back to jail
I'm lookin' for some thick hoes my homebase is Frisco
I used to fuck wid 'Ports, but now it's just the indo
Busta repellant, I sell it by the box
Use it to you motherfuckas that think you can stop this
Dirty rotten dollar I rock'd a hoe bopper
I'll quickidy stop a copper wid some shots from my choppah
What was I to do as a youngster
I didn't give a fuck so now you know me as a husalah
Top notch bitch the other level's where we takin' it
Cold World did it first so you niggas don't be hatin' it

[HOOK]
I'm a cold world hustler nigga, HEY!
I'm a cold world hustler nigga, HEY!
I'm a cold world hustler nigga, HEY!
I'm a cold world hustler nigga, HEY!
I'm a cold world hustler nigga, HEY!
I'm a cold world hustler nigga, HEY!
I'm a cold world hustler nigga, HEY!
Stuck in a cold world, HEY !

[Verse 2: Big Vic]
I'm a Cold World Hustler strugglin' strivin' survivin'
Harder than a motherfucka be in the 4-1-5
My anymosity preserves me as a smoker
I wouldn't trust a nigga wid a cake cause he's a sucka
Switch over to the fast lane I jumped into the dope game
My life is quickly changin', but things'll never be the same stackin'
Note after note slangin' weed slangin' coke
Makin' money off the chiz but the weed is gettin' smoked
Got ice like a iceman, my Ice Land is Oakdale
The place I do my dirt stack my loot and make my mail
Slangin' ya-yo bitch, from Ingles to Griffin
And if you don't know me stay the fuck up out my business
Like Cold World stalkin', y'all gangstas still talkin'
Meat wagon out one late night cause of the black and white chalkin'
Some niggas rollin' thick, some bitches on the dick
With whispers in the shadow cause I'm, Vic

HOOK
(laughing and talking 'til fade out)
