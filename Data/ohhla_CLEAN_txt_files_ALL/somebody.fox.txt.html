[Verse 1]
Did you ever have a girl and you thought she was it
To find out in the long run she ain't even shit
Dress her up nice, sport her all over town
And then behind your back she likes sleepin around
She's steppin out late while you're home in bed
To another brother kickin bass all in her head
You're layin there, lookin at her photo in frame
And you're chirpin like a bird while you're singin her name
You call her every night, then you're off by 10
When you hang up the phone, she hits the road again
Sad what I'm sayin, but it's gotta be true
Everybody knows your girl better than you
But what I'm sayin is this: you said she'd never do wrong
You met her at first, she did a dancin song
Said "I'll stay with you forever and brighten your world"
Face it, somebody bumpin your girl

Somebody else bumped your girl
And the thought of it wrecked your world
Somebody else bumped your girl
It makes you mad, don't it?

Somebody else bumped your girl
And the thought of it wrecked your world
Somebody else bumped your girl
It make you ill, won't it?

[Verse 2]
I met this kid named Jesse on my way uptown
Sittin on the train, on his face was a frown
I said "My man, what's the matter?" then he started to sweat
Said "My girl left the crib, and she didn't come home yet
Foxxx, I'm hurt, sad as could be
Cause everytime she leaves, she always calls me
But I ain't heard a word, I'm worried to death
I can't understand why she up and just left"
"How long has it been?" He said "About six days
And man, I did a lotta prayin, and I hope that it pays"
I looked him in his face, told him "don't be a cad
Cause ain't a girl in the world, it's insanity, mad
You better start thinkin and preparin your heart
Cause if you hear the wrong thing, you'll be torn apart"
Jesse stood up, the train came to a stop
Had a look on his face like he was about to pop
I said "So what's up?" Then he looked in my grill
Kinda like I look myself when I'm bout to get ill
He was lookin on a platform, right by a can
His girl lockin lips with another man
Jesse broke stupid, and pulled out a tool
And started lickin off like a crazy fool
The brother went rambo, actin wild
And shot sixteen people at the turnstyle
The girl got sick when she saw blood flowin
The brother she was with did a Jesse Owens
I couldn't believe the brother ruined his world
All because somebody else bumped his girl

Somebody else bumped your girl
And the thought of it wrecked your world
Somebody else bumped your girl
It makes you mad, don't it?

[Verse 3]
Now I'ma tell you all a story bout my man Jim Stone
Who had a three-floor mansion and a yacht of his own
He had enough money, but what capes the cake
He had the baddest girl in about 10 states
All about he ever talked about was lovin his girl
And how he'd never touch another in the whole wide world
Jim got the nerve, wants to buy her a ring
And when he put it on her finger, she was ready to sting
The brother had a party at his crib one night
Had the place laid out, and the music was hype
About 100 people, I would say, no less
Freddie foxxx ain't stupid, I can knowledge a mess
I noticed his girl, she kept grinnin a lot
She was hangin round the fireplace in this one spot
She looked like she was waitin for a train or a bus
She was waitin for Jim's best man, his boy Gus
Gus got slick, took the girl by the hand
And dipped the step like the Bionic Man
I stood there shakin my head, I had a flashback
Bout what happened uptown by the traintracks
Jim came over and he said to me "Fred
I got a real bad thought bumrushin my head"
I said "So what's the matter?" Then he looked at me twice
And said "I can't find my best man Gus or my wife"
Jim was on a mission, I could look in his eyes
And see the meter on his blood pressure startin to rise
He headed up the steps and I followed behind
And I could tell by his face he had death on his mind
He stood by the room and the door was cranked
Then he took off his shirt, and then we both stepped back
Jim kicked the door open and he stuck in his head
And saw Gus and his wife both naked in bed
Jim grabbed a bat, and I tell you the truth
He was swingin homeruns like my man Babe Ruth
He left em both layin there, stiff as a board
And he turned to me and said "Freddie Foxxx, I scored"
Two accounts murder one, now he sits in his cell
With a life-long sentence and a story to tell
I couldn't believe the brother ruined his world
All because somebody bumped his girl

Somebody else bumped your girl
And the thought of it wrecked your world
Somebody else bumped your girl
It makes you mad, don't it?

Somebody else bumped your girl
And the thought of it wrecked your world
Somebody else bumped your girl
It make you ill, won't it?
