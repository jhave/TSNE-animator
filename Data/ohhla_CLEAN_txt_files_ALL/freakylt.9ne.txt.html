(Hook: Krizz Kaliko) (2X)
I've been around the world I ya 
Freak so many girls I ya 
The women I done seen I ya 
Some freaky little things I ya

(Verse 1: Tech N9ne)
Yo, ya bet to know I gotta
Flex a flow about a 
Sexy ho I gotta
Let ya know about her
Me next to go inside her
I repped the mo beside her
We did it show at Granada
Sexy dark chocolate
I think her name was Aua Young Scholler Halleljah
What I got to do to get inside the coller
So I took her back to the mo
She rode it like a pony
She was O.G. 
Young chick it was better than it was supposed to be
Was a Mexican and Italian chick named Mexital Marie
For a minute she wondered about the chance she gets to wild wit me 
I'm ridin' with her and she had an enormous fart box
So we pulled over and I fucked it doggy style in the automatic car wash 
Later that date she took me to see bait 
She bought a nacho plate 
But only Tech N9ne got ate 
The cerebellum was great then she sat on top of the snake
I didn't even see bait so with my other bitch I had to skate
I got contex
Plus I got bomb ex
So after Grant then it's Kutt and baby I'm next 
So we can triple team up and fuck your spleen up 
Between us get 3 nuts then you can beam up 
Now ya sexual peak is met so don't fret
When I call you up and say what's happening baby it's Tech 
I'm callin' to see if you down for heated sex
So we can flex and you can lick the barcode on my neck 

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun)
Yo, yo she was a black gold, center fold classic
Chirped to Mack mode, that ass kept asking 
Provalaks and a double stack bag of exstacy
It's on now exactly (fiesta) 
I blasted (fo-eva)
Another mate I can check on chess was best for less dimeanor 
A record exec for Techa Nina
Like a man wit no arms
But she let Kutty plow the peach sorta like horses do farms 
A true charms tale 
Addicted wasn't supposed to see the booty
but I lucked up and Dave Weiner gave Kutt a thumbs up (keep it real)
From L-A-X to sunset
Trunks get the donks wet Beyonks let
Outta towners hunt sex for contest
Rican and black urinary freak in the sack (ol' what's her name)
Janelle used to let me skeet on her back end at the Grafton Down to the Best Western
Let's turn this camcorder on time for some action

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Grant Rice)
She was a supermodel
I met her in Miami
A video girl worl was candy
And she said i'm sour on the outside but sweet between the legs
A freak talked about what got her body hot
Like lokkipops and sheets
I replied like ma
I'm diabetic so i'm allergic to sweets
We continued politicing bout if I got a chicken 
And her favorite way of all positions I listen to her talk
Mesmerized by her eyes and the glide in her walk
She was sent by Satan himself
Temptations prayin' for help
But couldn't help it still
Found help in two shots and a pop of a pill
We peeled on our way
Blue Fountain room 318
Close the windows and le me sin blow
Like a whirl wind smoked and joked about each others girlfriends
And it's still a secret mi amor forever ima keep this behind closed doors
