[Chorus]
I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can't ever front, know why?
It's not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk
In time, they'll burn
I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can't ever front, know why?
Its not my style, no lie
They'll never take me alive
King Wizard!

[Verse 1]
You love that little bit of new, now throwback
Cleveland City snakeskin snapback
Niggaz know that uniform, keep the brim low
You doubt him, don't know a damn thing about him
What is hip hop without him, y'all niggaz really just don't know
Go, All day every day, hold on with all might
I gave the world my heart and they gave the kids insight
Yup now fuck you I ain't left
I'm outta my mind like all the time
And a nigga ain't missed one step yet, yep

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
My head hurt, gotta give me something that'll make me feel good
I remember couldn't tell a nigga nothing, man I wish you would
Niggaz ain't working, like me I had to put my bit in
All this rose gold I'm dipped in dressed in ? while I coast in clouds
That's my life babe, crystal clear, no cascade
I'm going, going I'm on a crusade
To save the kids from the weak shit
It's finally my world
Here all the girls can be my girl
Just sit back count stacks girl
Hold a nigga down all the time girl

[Chorus]</pre>
