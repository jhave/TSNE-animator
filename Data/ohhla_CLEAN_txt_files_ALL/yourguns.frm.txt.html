(Intro) AZ
Y'know, personally, I'm for the paper
As long as we all see doe
(Yo yo, big boys play for large sums) Yeah, uh huh
(Even bitches got their shit tight) Ha ha ha
Aight (If you're with us throw your guns up, what the fuck?
Form a philly, cock your shit back and bust)

[Half-A-Mil]
You acquired the knowledge, my brainwaves 'cause riots in college
Science scholar in this world of violence and dollars
Firm rapping god from the projects
It ain't hard, from Medicaid cards to platinum cars
My clique is that large to get their dick licked
and back massaged by rich chicks who rock Versace bras
In the drop, watching the stars
Yo, the conquest is ours, mission accomplished, shitting on Congress
Benz whipped with a 6, on this six million tons
When I appear reptilians run
Firm affilions, willions exile your team like Indians
Your style's a dream, we pop Cristal and drive Bentley's in 
The same streets you can't get a penny in
All my real shootout niggas hear me when
Half-A-Mil shoot out with Bohemians, calicos spitting in
Niggas splitting in the same position they're sitting in
What sentencing? We got too much Benjamins
We even got triple six IBM plastic currency with chips in them
Images killing them, my niggas lay back
We use to pump a G, now we pump 100-K packs
Guns aimed at ya, destroy your whole world like *?K-mat?*
What part of the game's that? To curse my hot verse is flame rap
Players got the game trapped, I be the king mack
On my bitches mind 'til their bring crack...

(Chorus) AZ
Yo yo, big boys play for large sums
Stack up, strategise, watch the cons come
It's all a game, even bitches got their shit tight
On the scene, 18, sucking dick, right? It's sick, right?
If you're with us throw your guns up, what the fuck?
Form a philly, cock your shit back and bust

[AZ]
What? From NY to New Orleans, we're all fiends
Court scenes, flashbacks to kidnaps in Fort Green
Guns bussing, stash house out in Flushing
Corruption, killer men-tal is foul adjusting
Cold nights, handled the streets my whole life
Back and forth, kikes, focus for niggas who've lost sight
Travel thought wise, beyond light years, way across skies
Short-i's, so many making living off lies
Anti-up, hoping my new shorty don't stand me up
It had me stuck, after this session, I plan to fuck
Hot pursuit, a real splitting image of Pop Duke
Block lasoo's, paper player part of my roots
So what do you gross yearly? I live this game so sincerely
Really, most rap cats couldn't come near me
So it's either or, Peter pay Paul, you and yours
Fools in fours, regulate life thru rules and laws...

(Chorus)

[Half-A-Mil]
Firm official, 8-50 I, burning pistol
Black Magnum P-I, mack V-I, willie hat
Half beehive, wise guy
'95 I look in my eye, praising Allah
Project aiming rod
Greatest star Akbar, pushing a hot car
Shark Bar, private engagement, live entertainment
I grab mics and I explain it
How I've went from the blinds to the brainless
To the minds of the wise and the famous
Niggas wives admire the guy's arrangers
Take off their wedding rings and give head to the king
It's just a cheddar thing, amaretta, Armani leather thing
We in to better things like wetting the brains
Jumping outta stretches with minks, crime connected with link
Up in the club buying drinks, bitches eyeing the spinks
Hustler haters hate us, my guns say "Fuck what they think"
My son copped a Hummer this summer with a buttoned-up mink

(Chorus)</pre>
