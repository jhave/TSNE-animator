[Intro: unknown female]
I wanna get kissed, kissed kissed {*4X*}

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Uhh, Nickel Nina nigga Twitter beefin, first rapper that shot a fan!
Gucci's my absolute state of mind like Waka's man
Choppers sprayin, gettin head in the car parked new Gallardo
This bitch suckin my dick today, call it yesterday's news tomorrow
Stretch a nigga out, I'm the new Tae-Bo, 'bout to cross over, I'm the new Ivo
'Bout to save a couple of these bitches, that's right, I'm the new Bible
You? You five-oh, me? I'm more grounded than punishments, but I'm too fly though
Y'all niggaz be whinin/wine'in, I should call you Moscato

[Eminem]
Look down at the floorboard looks like someone left a pair of stilleto shoes in my Tahoe
Never know just what type of a hoe inside of my ride I may let
Last night went to 5 AM and she ain't even recover from last Friday yet
Hoes all over the ride like it's an ice cream truck, I can see why they fret
I already ran over two hoes and I ain't get out the fuckin driveway yet
Soon as I open the door you try to resist, what for? 
Get in girl, don't front shorty you're
fightin an unwinnable war
It's useless as tits in a boar or, little tits on a whore
Got 'em actin like spoiled brats kickin and screamin 
like little kids throwin fits on the floor
Get in the whip but you ain't turnin this frog to a prince
Why you tryin to keep convincin me for?

[Chorus: Eminem] + (female)
(I wanna get kissed, kissed kissed) You won't get one
(I wanna get kissed, kissed kissed) Not from me
(I wanna get kissed, kissed kissed) Not on the lips, are you crazy?
(I wanna get kissed, kissed kissed) Maybe the cheek but that's all you gon' get from me

[Eminem]
Now ya in my whip just as long as you understand that I can't be WHIPPED!
You say companionship, I say abandon ship
I'm a jigolo so you know I'm always on the go
I don't got no time to slow down for no relation-SHIT
Drop the P and add a T, yeah you can get mad at me all you want
But I'm ghost before you can even say "boo" hun, let alone call me one
A one night stand is all he wants with a female fan, yeah one like Stan
And he's so about a one night stand his bedroom has two lamps and only one nightstand
Get the hint? Ooh yeah boo; ew, I'm ain't finna argue
But why do you think they call it "boo"?
Yeah cause the sound of it's supposed to scare you!

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Oh hoe, we can share you, in the back of the McClaren
I don't give a fuck what your name is
We gon' call you "hi" and "bye," hope you bi, in the meantime your name is Sharon
Slows, the, flow, down, so, I, can, what?
Tell you same face I make when I'm shootin the gun's the same face that I make when I FUCK!
From the back with my hand on your neck pressin your face against these sheets is insane
You vin change, cause I'm outta this world girl, I got that Milky Way dick vein
I'm at an all-time high with highness, I'm at an all-time fly with flyness
And this is exactly what they say when they bow to Your Highness, yeah

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"] + (Eminem)
Nickel Nina nigga Twitter beefin, first rapper that shot a fan!
(Push a chick out the car while it's movin like Waka's man)
Her bottom's dark but her top is tan
Her private parts, got her on the pole like the opposite of her poppa's plans
(C'mon stripper let's hit the strip 180, throw it reverse and drop the Trans!)
(I'm in a trance, man look at this bitch dance)
Lookin at this tramp like what are you wearin girl? Quit playin
(Yeah bitch, are them scratch-and-sniff pants?)
(Well let me scratch 'em) {*sniffs*} Let me sniff, yeah
What? Did I say that? I'm on lean like Styrofoam cups and kickstands

[Eminem]
Middle finger stuck on fuck, stiff hands
But girl you got a butt like no if ands, so yeah what the hell maybe, all hail Shady
He'll tell it like it is so tell Katy Perry he's on her tail, he's tailgating
These bells are my mating call and I'm here, bell's waiting and tell Lady
Gaga she can quit her job at the post office she's still a, mail/male lady!
Wouldn't fuck her with her dick, you heard it, the verdict's in, he's allergic to divas
He'll take meat +Cleavers+ to 'em; him don't give a damn about Beaver, do him?
What a demon, a behemoth, evil just seems to be seethin through him

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I like the little strip tease you doin this evenin, you and 
me gon' find three more chickadees and have a +Minaj+ like Nicki
You hot like a Dickie outfit in Texas without shit under it sweatin
Suck my dick or gets to steppin's my logic

[Eminem]
My God trick, my dick is hard and stiff as a yardstick
What are we gonna do, ride around 'til we're car sick?
I'ma put this shit in park like dog shit
And you can blow me in the dark in the parkin lot 
of the trailer park by the garbage
What are you waitin on me to roll out the carpet? 
Condoms are in the glove compartment, let's start it
Think I'm jokin? What am I sittin here tryin to make
fake farts with my armpits?
Tryin to get you to spit pop through your nose? 
Am I here to amuse you? Stop it

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm in yo' pocket on side of a church
The other hand reachin for the bottom of your purse
You're givin me head in a boxin stance
My dick's so big you can drop it in dirt
I'm not yo' man, we sparrin partners
It's, five things you are in charge of
That's - suckin a dick, suckin a dick, 
suckin a dick, suckin a dick, suckin a dick

[Eminem]
And if you ain't suckin dick why you sittin there with puckered lips? 
Oh that's collagen, muh'fuckin bitch
What'chu mean how'd you get suckered into this? 
You gon' jump in my truck and then try to get truculent?

[Royce Da 5'9"]
You should be sufferin, you should be cookin
You should be bucklin your seatbelt with oven mitts

[Eminem]
Excuse me while I make an ass out of myself 
but it's only because I just wanna get

[Chorus]
