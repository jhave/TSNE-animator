Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Ferrari Lifestyle
Tell the haters I'm sorry
I'm passing them on the rise
what can they say now
Ferrari Lifestyle
Tell the haters I'm sorry
I'm passing them on the rise
what can they say now
I know, I know, I now, I know

[Fabolous]
Yo, I'm such a sight to see I turn a hater to a tourist
The way I order Rose, I turn a waiter to a flourist
Ferrari Lifestyle, that mean I'm living fast
on the road to riches you don't slow down
you give it gas
25 is what they couldn't see us living past
we was broke just once
someone give us cash
Obama on the wrist, presidential Rollie
Beverly Hills coppin', I ain't Axel Foley

I'm just a young nigga moving like a Californian
Word to proposition 19 in California
I go from 0-60, a couple seconds
she go from sober to tipsy and gettin' naked
me and Game the '010 Crockett and Tubbs
Trey said he gon' meet us on the block of the club
you heard Jerome, but instead of a Benzo
get rid of your Friends-oh to ride in this Enzo

[Chorus]
Ferrari Lifestyle
Tell the haters I'm sorry
I'm passing them on the rise
what can they say now
Ferrari Lifestyle
Tell the haters I'm sorry
I'm passing them on the rise
what can they say now
I know, I know, I now, I know</pre>
