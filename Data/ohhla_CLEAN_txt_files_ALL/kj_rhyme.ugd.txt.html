[Intro: King Just]
Yo! This is K.J., all day, every day
Around your way, in your hallway
Puffin' ganje, Hillside Scrambled eggs..
Let's go... let's go... let's go..
K.J. rhyme, all day, every day, let's go..

[King Just]
Prepare for a Battlestar Gallectica, this is Attica
America, home of the Chainsaw Massacre
Dracula, sink my teeth into this beat
And sleep on corners where you drug dealers meet
Stay out of reach, but I keep arm distance
We can't hold him down, cuz I'm just too persistant
Listen, nitroglycerin, finish him
Kryptonite for all you fuckin' Supermen
It's him again, and I'm feelin' fine
Watch where you walk, you might step on landmines
Tech nine crime, quote him line for line
Intertwine with a mind like Albert Einstein
Optimus prime, throw heat like the sun
I got fees in this rap, why you think I'm on the run?
And when it's all said and done, I'm handlin' my biz
All the kids around the world is gonna is, is.

[Chorus 4X: King Just w/ children]
Nobody rhymes like K.J. rhymes
Nobody, K.J. rhyme

[King Just]
Now which one of ya'll could do it like I?
I guess you the reason they put "pumpk" in the pie
Quicker sea fry, hang glide slide
K.J. go way-way like pantry pie
Zebra Lounge crowd, yo, that's Lounge
If I ain't put it down by the ramp with 18 pound
Cherry jubilee, hang off roofs like D.P
Ever since Champ God robbed the fuckin' Mickey D's
Ya'll was scarred and needed reincarnation of jackpot
Stop frontin', cuz you got the hip hop Scott 'Rock
Face lock the shot, we got the studio booked
Look up your history, I'm still off the hook
It's Mark Twain, I'm rollin' like Oliver Twist
Back now, to smackdown shit that you missed
Kiss where the sun don't shine, bottom line
Ya'll niggaz better hope I don't get a deal and sign

[Chorus 4X]

[King Just]
You the Mick Dynamite or Mr. Excite
You've been rappin' for a long time but don't sound right
Not quite as the hype that you recite
Mr. All-Day, I'll do it to your ass night
On sight, I smash anything you write
With K-9 teeth for niggaz who bagpipe
Walk to the light and bring your mic
You won't last one minute in a ten round fight
The Al-Qada type that'll snipe your windpipe
Siege your general, and strip him of his stripes
Either you men or mice, you gon' still pay the price
You either take my advice, or roll the dice
Real life, still trife, walk with a gun
Talk with a knife, double c.d., so you can buy me twice
On tight, and you just might take flight
M.C.'s got left, why you think they not right
Hang glide like a kite, on the turnpike
With two bitches, that's some Dick Van Dyke
Pay-per-view satellite, there's a need to feed my appetite
Pick up your weight, cuz you ain't got the hype
Battle me, your need an invite, black or white
And I'll still drink a forty with ice
I still smoke a leaf joint from Spike, ight?
I'm the reason why Coca-Cola had to fuckin' remix the Sprite
He's nice, and taste like Chinese rice
And from shit on the stick, he the pastry whites
You the Latter Day Saints, I'm the Poltergeist
I'm the whole damn pie, nigga, you just a slice
This is a heist, I suggest you remove your ice
Before you be up in close and person over Christ
Get on your Big Wheel bike and take a hike
Cuz around these parts, you not liked
Parasite, don't have me flex my mic
I don't rock Air Force One's, I call it Air Strikes (*echoes*)

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro: children]
Way!
No way!
No way!
No way!
No way!</pre>
