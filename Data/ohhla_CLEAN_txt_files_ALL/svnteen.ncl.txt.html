Missy: Yo
Nicole: (mmm) You know (mmm)
	I don't know what's up with this cat
	But I know
	I know he's gonna be mine

Missy:
Yes I'm the supa dupa
I'm the superstar
I got a super flow
That goes super far
I need a super man
That's got a super tan
That can deactivate my body like the super friends, uh huh

Nicole (Missy):
Was the finest guy in school (say what)
He got the whole damn school locked
And I thought he was cute (uh huh)
Wanna see, I had to stop
Boy how are you? (uh)
And by the way, Nicole is my name
So I slipped him my number showed him how us began
(hey yo freaky freaky uh)

Chorus:
Call me
If you need someone to talk to
Call me
Even though I'm seventeen
Call me
When you need someone to talk to
Call me
Call me

Nicole (Missy):
(Brrr mmm)
He was only seventeen
And I was checkin' him everyday
And he's no beginner
He made me hot like filled with me
I gotta find a way
To keep all his attention to me
So I slipped him a paper told him hit me off at three, hey
(uh call me)

Chorus

Nicole:
(Yes I know I really want him) Really want him
(Yes I know I really need him) Really need him
(Yes I know I gotta have him) Gotta have him
(You can call me up in the evening) Call me up
(Yes I know I really want him) Really want him
(Yes I know I really need him) Really need him
(Yes I know I gotta have him) Gotta have him
(You can call me up in the evening) Ooh yeah

Chorus

Nicole (Missy):
(Nicole) So what the sunshine
What's yours is mine
You won't succeed without tryin'
Never blind
See I'm the type of female to hold on
Like deodorant I roll on
And gets my flow on (uh huh)
I'm livin' in reality
Respect me
My image is not a pocket book
And I won't get took
Girls get shook when they look
My style is John Blaze (John Blaze)
So I'ma make it hot and leave somebody in a daze
My age is seventeen
Call me 
My age is seventeen

Missy (Nicole):
(If you need someone to talk to) ooh ooh
