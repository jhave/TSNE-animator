Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Understand that what goes around comes around

And I don't ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me it's time to go
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay
Tell me I'm all you need

Understand that what goes around comes around

And I don't ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best
Tell me it's not me
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me I'm all you need

[Verse 1]
Understand, I am
The renowned, newest talk of the town
When errybody talk and just keeps on talkin' about
Wassup? Tellin' girls "You should call if you down"
And if my phone doesn't ring, then leave it after the pound
'Cause I be up in the air, more than I do on the ground
My city is on my hat, and I'm wearin' it like a crown (Westside)
You're now rockin' wit' somebody on they fuckin' bidness
Watch me do it big, no pun intended (Boi)
See, I done seen nights turn to days
Love turn to hate, hugs turn to laids
Niggas turn to sirs, Andre to Spades
'Cause when it turns real, that's when everybody turns fake
Instead of sayin' fuck all 'a y'all and turning away
Man, I was cool enough to say "Fuck it" and let 'em stay
Fuck, I hate to say I told you so
So buying rounds is my way of saying "Told you, ho"

Understand that what goes around comes around

And I don't ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me it's time to go
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay
Tell me I'm all you need

Understand that what goes around comes around

And I don't ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best
Tell me it's not me
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me I'm all you need

[Verse 2]
Now, I can't tell what's a better accessory
My new watch, or the chick that's standin' right next to me
Killin' niggas at rap, but being the man's my specialty
I love shitting on all my exes especially
Double shots, then re-reload
Let's toast to the interns that made it to CEO
Boss player, collectin' every single check that's owed out
Puttin' on a show until everything is sold out
Man, I'm chillin' wit' Jays, 'Ye's, and Common Senses
It's crazy when legends are peers and your competition
I would hate to be a almost nigga
I call ya that, 'cause you gossip like y'all almost bitches
You know, went to school with Jay, and was almost Jigga
Or hooped against LeBron and would almost get 'im
Y'all niggas make me realize how good almost isn't
Would hate to look back on my life and say "I almost did it"
F-ck that, reflectin' on the last chain I bought
They on my tracks, waitin' on the next train of thought
Visualizin' how the crown might be
Got the whole rap game tryna sound like me

Understand that what goes around comes around

And I don't ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me it's time to go
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay
Tell me I'm all you need

Understand that what goes around comes around

And I don't ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best
Tell me it's not me
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me I'm all you need

This dedicated to my ex girls, both of 'em
It's also dedicated to everybody who be talkin' shit behind my back
And then when I see y'all, y'all act like "Awww, I'm so happy for you"
That's some bitch-ass shit, nigga

Understand that what goes around comes around
(This also dedicated to everybody who's fuckin' winnin' today)
And I don't ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me it's time to go
(Everybody gettin' it)
(After niggas said you couldn't get it)

Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don't ever wanna come down
(G.O.O.D. Music and the best)
So, baby, tell me who the best
(No I.D.!)</pre>
