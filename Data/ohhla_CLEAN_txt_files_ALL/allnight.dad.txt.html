[Fergie]
We can dance, dance, dance
Clap your hands, hands, hands
All night, if you're in the mood
Do what you wanna do
All night long

Happy days are here
So leave your cares behind
Just relax your mind
It's so easy to do it

Just enjoy yourself
If the feeling's right
Get your groove on tonight
Take your time tonight
Everything's alright
Ain't nothin' but a party

We can dance, dance, dance
Clap your hands, hands, hands
All night, if you're in the mood
Do what you wanna do
All night long

Get up on the floor
Don't worry 'bout a thing
The rhythm's got you now
So come on, get into it

Just enjoy yourself
If the feeling's right
Get your groove on tonight
Take your time tonight
Everything's alright
Ain't nothin' but a party

We can dance, dance, dance
Clap your hands, hands, hands
All night, if you're in the mood
Do what you wanna do
All night long

Have a good time (uh huh)
Lay back, relax (free)
Just free your mind
Let the music take control of you

[Puff Daddy]
If it's a hit then I musta did it
If it's not then I wasn't with it
Bad Boy stay committed
Whether hip-hop or R</pre>
