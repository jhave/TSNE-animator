(Hook)
These fool daisies won't be fuckin with me (With me)
Cause it's a government conspiracy (With me)
These fool daisies won't be fuckin with me (With me)
Cause it's a government conspiracy (With me)
These fool daisies won't be fuckin with me (With me)
Cause it's a government conspiracy (With me)

(Verse 1, Layzie Bone)
It's a wonder why niggas can't get on they feet
We try and we try, but we suffer defeat
Never the less, we still stuck in these streets
Try to compete up against the elite
Everything's so corrupted, headed for destruction
The rich could help, but they don't do nothin
So I thought I'd just say a little somethin
Government tell lies, they frontin
Think about the money that they spendin on the war
People still sick, and it's people still poor
Hungry little kids bein locked outdoor
America over there fightin for oil
Plenty of solutions to wipe our polutions
I'ma tell the truth, since y'all don't know
Better open your mind, take time to grow
Illuminati, population control
Plot-plot-plot, they killin us dead
Hear us on the radio, but they won't play it
They know what it is, but they too scared
FCC probably have they head, just don't care
Mama's on welfare, daddy locked up for the rest of his life
Bob Barker is the prison he in, talkin about the price is right
I'ma light the light, cause ain't no fear in me
Tell y'all about this conspiracy
Like my name favorite flavor, Chuck D
I'm the new Public Enemy
They say this Hennessey, is bad for me
But I'ma go'on head, pour me a cup
Cause it seem like, we already fucked
So I might as well just press my luck

(Hook)

(Verse 2, Bizzy Bone)
What a conspiracy, seriously baby
Man, we are the riders
So many beautiful ones inside us on this grainular climates
O-zone, it's gettin closer and closure
How does a toaster, let us solar power these panels
With wind gusts and odors
Alaska meltin by the seconds, I recon
We need some prayers
Gather all the snow we can conger
And saturate oceans neighbors
Gotta be, sharp as razors just like Generals and Majors
Elite, if I could speak, hear my cry from the savior
Hey bruh, you still love me, all that I wanted was change
I know that it's strange
But I'm from the Manjor, I was brought up with great change
For the better man, goverment officials don't even know
No more secrets, I can hear it, and I can see it, fo sho
Dear Lord, if I can speak without bein murdered and killed
Whatever happens, Allah I love you, you are will
The slave Serpent is here
I'm with Jesus Christ, Your child
Star rocker, glory thing
Forever, Christ my pal

(Hook)

(Verse 3, Layzie Bone)
Conspiracy theory, call it H.I.V.
Took my mentor, Eazy-E
He was rollin with the B.O.N.E.
But it didn't add up to me
We was friends, a bird flyin up on stage
Nigga was strong, didn't look like Aids
Cut the curls and started wearin them braids
With them Cleveland boys, we was bout to get paid
But he had to move things out the way
And he had a lot of things to say
So he got rid of Jerry Helen
He was very jealous, I remember that day
And then in December he took us to New York, we was bout to blow
He bought us all leather jackets
We was wearin khakis, it was so damn cold
And the Cube got to kick it that night
That night at the tunnel was legendary
Wasn't nothin nobody could tell me
N.W.A. you feel me?
Then we headed back to L.A.
Nigga had a new plan, but E got sick
Then he went to Jerry Helen's doctor
Damn E, why you do that shit?
Took a shot for the flu, now what did that do?
Little E got worse, it was very scary
We thought it was temporary
He was diagnosed, in January
In February, it was full-blown
Then March, little E was gone
Somebody explain that
While Magic Johnson's still kickin it strong

(Hook)

(Outro, Layzie Bone)
Yeah man, we was out there in New York in December, man
With that boy Eazy-E, kicked it real big
It was cold as fuck out there, man
You know what I mean? It was like 80 degrees in L.A.
So when we got out there he bought us new leather coats and all that good shit
Then, ya know, we kicked it at the tunnel with the boy Ice Cube
So this N.W.A., Bone Thugs thang, it was real big
So we come back, E got a motherfuckin common cold
He goes to Jerry Helen's doctor after he fired Jerry Helen
Next thing we know, next month, January
Eazy-E, is H.I.V. positive
February, Eazy-E is full-blown Aids
Next thang we know, March, Eazy-E is dead
That's a conspiracy man, ain't never heard of that
I thought it took years for H.I.V. to develop
What the fuck is goin on out here?</pre>
