(Verse 1, AK)
She had a different faith, different stroke
And she like to get poked in the throat
Like to watch her in slow mo'
It was like whoa, it was like whoa
It was like

(Belo)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You didn't know?
Know, know, know, know

(AK)
She even said I had cold game
Emphasize on the way I put the pain and the thang on her
Or maybe it's the way that I came on her
She put it on her mama, that a nigga could get a menage a trois
So I called up who?
(Belo)
Who? Who? Who? Who?
(N.A.R.D)
So I called up who?
(Belo)
Who? Who?

(Belo)
Belo... matter of fact that's the same old broads
They be hangin' out wit' them same old broads
Just too weak, I had my condom fall (You had your condom fall?)
Yeah dogg, yeah dogg
She can tell you lies, but I know she a star
Is she in the car? Meet me at the bar
Menage a trois, trois
Menage a trois, trois, trois
Menage a trois, trois, trois
Menage a trois, trois, trois
Menage a trois, trois, trois

(Hook, Johnny P)
She was like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(This is for the playa in you)
It was cool wit it, cool wit it
(Girl I don't know what to do)
She was like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(This is for the playa in you)
It was cool wit it, cool wit it
(Girl I don't know what to do)

(N.A.R.D)
Sittin' at the bar
With two sets of twins
Just hopped up outta the Benz
My fur up off in the wind
Don't deal wit' nothin' but ten's
Gotta pimp this broad again
Gotta play these cards again
Now look who just walked in
AK, (What's up?) Belo

(Belo)
What's up, up, up, up
What's up, up, up, up

(N.A.R.D)
Now this chick at the bar
She like to fuck
And her, in the butt
And her, whatever the fuck
Gobble the dick
And swallow the nut
Yeah I got that
Can't spend that
Double back
Ain't with that
See my nigga split cats
My number the same when you get back
Meet me at the pool, let's chit-chat
Where JP at?
Where JP at?
Where JP at?

(Johnny P)
Out to the car
Do you really really really
Want a menage a trois?
Called up ya girls
To let 'em know who you are
We can get in on
Up in this spot
They can't be no JP now
She goes (uhh) She goes (ahh)
She been bouncin' like that from the start
Let's get back to the part-y
Part'y, part', part'
Whooaa part', part', part'
Whoaaa part', part', part'
Whoaa part', paaart'
Whoaaaa

(N.A.R.D)
All ya seen was the thongs on her
Just slide down the pole
Doin' it all cold
Plus she just know
All the freeze be froze
P-p-pooooke
In her mouth that's shaped like 'oooooo

(Belo)
Nooow, she gave me some head
And she gave her some head
And I gave.... nah!
It was all in the plot
Whether little one or not
Get yo ass off the block
Get yo ass off the block
Get yo ass off the block

(N.A.R.D)
See we all can take her back to the cut
Loosen' them thongs, and tie her up
Get the brains, and fire the bud
But that's after we all done fucked

(Johnny P)
Fucked, fucked, fucked
Whooa, fucked, fucked, fucked
Whoaa, fucked, fucked, fucked
You know we, fucked, fuuucked

(Hook, Johnny P)
She was like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(This is for the playa in you)
It was cool wit it, cool wit it
(Girl I don't know what to do)
She was like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(This is for the playa in you)
It was cool wit it, cool wit it
(Girl I don't know what to do)
