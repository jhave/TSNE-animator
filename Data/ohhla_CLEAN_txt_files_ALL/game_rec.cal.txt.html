[Chorus: 2x] 
Game still recognize game 
caught up for a minute 
but I still in it for the change 
and it's a shame 
And everybody thought of slack 
I let em know, fo sho 
Coo Coo Cal still got much game 

[Verse 1]
Still got that drive in my eyes for this rap 
And let the city know, 
better disappear (?) fear that I weren't comin back 
Packed up my pen and paper 
Set asside the gin and capers 
Called up Big Hank and then he drop a bomb for a big old playa 
Competition scared cuz done wrote a rap 
All up in the clubs 
Illegally makin love tried a (?) mack 
We see dem letters from the record shops 
Screamin they love the album, 
and then get near ten thousand when the next one drop 
Haters try to deny the funk, but affected by the bong 
They gettin caught up (?) wit my tape on bum 
Ya'll shoulda known that I weren't gone 
Needa sit back and watch a bunch of squares take a big fat playa throne 
I come two quarters slip 'n fall 
Besides I gotta gang a trunks 
backin me up with pumps, and they all ball 
I kinda wanna mention names 
Just to let em know, fo sho, Coo Coo Cal still got much game 

[Chorus: 2x]
Game still recognize game 
caught up for a minute 
but I still in it for the change 
and it's a shame 
And everybody thought of slack 
I let em know, fo sho 
Coo Coo Cal still got much game 

[Verse 2]
Still count the cheese with all dem G's from off the set 
And let the city know that I'm out the game 
but I still count change on a regular, cashin checks 
Ain't nothin change except my dizzalls 
And the fact that I don't bizzalls 
But I still take shoppin sprees up at the mizzalls, shzzalls 
Should've known that I was comin back 
Ridin 'Lac on hundred spokes 
Runnin with folks that (?) get fools to talk that smack' 
I'm in this game until I die 
Even the (?) when I'm high 
But physically fit 
to drop these hits until you hear my cries 
Coo Coo Cal now, 
Coo Coo Cal later 
Coo Coo Cal a make a promise, 
I'ma sell a mil and make em feel the playa 
They got me strugglin on my own 
Tall and skinny, but in me I got the muscle 
out here hustlin for a microphone 
Ain't no stoppin this bum rush 
Cuz I'm plush 
Haters pretend but end up gettin crushed 
Try'n ta fuck wit us 
I kinda wanna mention names 
Just to let em know, fo sho, Coo Coo Cal still got much game 

[Chorus: 2x]

[Verse 3]
Game still recognize game 
caught up for a minute 
but I still in it for the change 
and it's a shame 
And everybody thought of slack 
I let em know, fo sho 
Coo Coo Cal still got much game 

[Coo Coo Cal talking] 
Ha ha ha, ya'll thought I was gone, didn't you? 
Fool 
it's Coo Coo Cal now 
it's Coo Coo Cal tomorrow 
it's Coo Coo Cal to the year two-thou 
Now, I dunno what made ya'll think, ya understand, I was up out this game 
I'm in this game for life, and that's fo real 
You'll see me now 
Ha ha you gone see me later, fo sho 

[Verse 3]
Still kick it with G's who imbreeded by some flo's 
Had to let the city know '86 assassin 
still blastin smashin off on Vo's 
With Smith 'n pros and cars to roll 
With G's load up, get drunk and kick it like two playas when the (?) 
Ain't nothin change except the season 
And do no dirt until you fools give us a reason 
Tryin to count miss (?) 
My clique is thicker than a brick buildin 
You even think about runnin up on my clan you'll get a sick feelin 
Ain't nothin poppin but that (?) 
All up in the movies, 
gettin freaky with your braud cuz she's sweatin partna 
I kinda wanna mention names 
Just to let em know, fo sho, Coo Coo Cal still got much game 

[Chorus: 4x]
Game still recognize game 
caught up for a minute 
but I still in it for the change 
and it's a shame 
And everybody thought of slack 
I let em know, fo sho 
Coo Coo Cal still got much game </pre>
