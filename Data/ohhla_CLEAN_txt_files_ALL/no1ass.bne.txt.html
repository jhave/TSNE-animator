[Bone]
Stop, everybody, what's that sound?
AK-47, so ya better hit the ground
Stop, everybody, what's that sound?
AK-47, so get the fuck down!

[Layzie]
Well it's the #1 Assassin
Provin' a point to many people
Some claim to be assassins
But to Bone there is no equal
And Bone will stand alone
And buck down any other sucka
Me quick to pull me gun
And straight up kill that muthafucka
You never can know when Bone'll ?
Commit the one eighty-seven
'Cause all I can see is cockin'
The nine and sendin' you straight to Heaven
You're dead on the dot, so fuck a blood clot
You know I'm expectin' to win this
So give 'em up, chump. I beatin' you down
To survive, survival of the fittest
No one can last. I'm beatin' your ass
I'm quicker to blast. I'm keepin'
The cash including the stash
So I will be killing you quick in a flash, come down
And it's a shame how I will kill without hesitation
Me load me clip, me fingers slip
Now that's the assassination
So pick up the body and tie it to bricks
Go dump it in the river
I'm letting you know that Bone is no ho
You never catch me shiver
So, don't try to trip, you're getting a blast
Some shit that's everlasting
You had a run-in, and now you're done-in by the #1 Assassin

Chorus

[Layzie]
Now see me hypin' 'em up and strikin' 'em
Keepin 'them doper than the rest
'Cause Layzie Bone is an assassin
Puttin' a bullet to your chest
You're caught. Me watch ya bleed
Now you may say that me sick
If you a bitch, me slap you down
And fuck you up with the dick
Because the villainous killer
I'm chillin' now with your girl on me dick, uh
The slimmer the nigga the quicker
The trigger unloads on your shit
'Cause I be hype when I'm on the set
Squeezin' the trigger, then me break
It's murder she wrote, the reason me broke
So please don't test me fate
Layzie Bone will pull me gun, don't consider it strange
That reggae man who's on the scene
With the mind that's deranged, uh
The shit that me be doin' is like far beyond the usual
Rockin the mic or takin' a life
I still kick funky musical
Bone will grab a bitch and bone
That bitch till she bleeds, uh
The weapon is kept in up in me pants
Me givin' her what she needs
For y'all niggas on me dick
Me will be buck buck buck buck blastin'
'Cause Layzie Bone is the #1 Assassin

Chorus

[Layzie]
Now Layzie Bone is comin' again
Me smokin' them niggas like dope
And when me load me clip it's like (imitates gun noise)
Me swift you slit your tongue, me lickin' a lyrics when me drunk
Buck you down with me handgun, then me goin'
In me trunk for me pump for that redneck copper always on me dick
So me forced to grab the pump and let the fucker go click
So me peelin' off his cap 'cause I'm not down for goin' to prison
Me poprrring the clip, 'cause it's a bullet that me give 'em
Me poprrr his head to keep him dead to keep 'em off me back
Me set it off, count the money in stacks 'cause Bone is here to attack
Me stumbled around, me fumbled around, to keep it at a flow
Me kickin' ass. You feel me blast from me forty-fo
But don't you fuck with me 'cause Tony Tone got me back
And Krayzie Bone is steppin' in with the ultimate jackin'
With the AK-47, Wish is buck buck buck buck blastin'
'Cause Layzie Bone is the #1 Assassin
