Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yea, yea
Real niggas can relate
Yea, Ville niggas can relate man
Yea

I see you lookin' at me hard, shawty what it's gone be?
Would you ride next to your man or let him run up on me?
'Cause I see him tryna grill, better take his ass home
'Fore I lay his ass out, then I take your ass home
I ain't even gone front man a nigga tryna cut
I ain't tryna take his place, I just wanna hit you up
When that nigga ain't around I just wanna pick you up
Bring you back to the crib, sip a little liquor up
Then I give you a massage, get you wet get you up
Then I give you what you want, if it's clean I'll lick it up
Now you can do me, if it's right my shit is up
Face down on your stomach take that ass and lift it up

Then I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yea yo' pussy do bang got no problem hookin' up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we gettin up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up
Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yea yo' pussy do bang got no problem hookin' up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we gettin up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up

I'll be that nigga on the side, when you feel you wanna creep
When you in the bed alone while your man run the streets
All you gotta do is dial, let the phone ring twice
Babygirl I love your style I won't even think twice
I ain't even gone front, man a nigga tryna beat
I ain't tryna wife you up though you is a dimepiece
I just love the way you ride like a certified freak
How you throw it right back got a niggas thighs weak
So just hit me when you want it, you know how to find me
Got no time for no games you know how the grind be
But I'mma make the time if you bouta dial me
I'mma make you say my name like you caller ID

Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yea yo pussy do bang got no problem hookin' up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we gettin up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up

Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yea yo' pussy do bang got no problem hookin' up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we gettin up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up

Give you money to get your hair did? He can do that
Pay for dinner and a movie? Man, he can do that
Work you out in the bed? Maybe he can do that
But I know you'd much rather call me to do that
And girl I'm wit' it
Yea - I'm so wit' it
Babygirl I'm so wit' it
So let me hit it

Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yea yo' pussy do bang got no problem hookin' up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we gettin up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up

Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yea yo' pussy do bang got no problem hookin' up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we gettin up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up</pre>
