[Chorus]
Like the person needs his soul
Fight the will to need his own
Just talk to em for a minute, ay just talk to em for a minute
Like the baby needs to cry
If you go I swear I'll die

[Verse 1]
How the fuck I'm free out here and you locked in there
Your whole family acts like I don't care
They don't know about the nights I just lay in my bed
I can't even sleep, I just lay in my bed
Eyes full of tears and a heart full of pain
Take deep breaths everytime I hear your name
You was more than family you was like my brother
So when the shit went down it's like I lost my brother
And I wish we could trade places
Swear to God dawg wish we could trade places
Livin' a life of crime, but it wasn't your life it was more like mine
I often think about the close calls we had
And I often think about the close brawls we had
And I love my nigga, what you know bout that
And I'll do anything to get golmouf back talk to 'em

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Mel man you my heart I swear to god
Knew you was real man I saw it from the start
Even when I was wrong my nigga had my back
Even when I was right my nigga had my back
We used to laugh, wasn't shit funny
Late night at my grandma house counting money
I trust you with my life dawg
If I was married, I'd trust you with my wife dawg
Any given time a half a mill in your possession
You aint called in two days man I still wasn't stressing
Cause when I talk my nigga listen
Switch shit, you used to help me with them pigeons
Earnest T. won't talk to me dawg and it hurts
She treat a nigga like I'm the scum of the earth
In your eyes I couldn't do no wrong
So to you I dedicate this song

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Must've bust ten rounds through the strap in your lap
Knew I was a gangsta I wasn't going for that
Pussy nigga in my yard, talkin' shit
Knowin' damn well I was on some G shit
Let the whole clip ride and didn't think
Let the whole clip ride and didn't blink
You asked me kindly not to bring the white in the house
And then what I do, bring the white in the house
Bricks in the attic and you ain't know
Your grandson killin' em, he getting 24
Feds at the door, I'm out of town
You ain't tell em shit, you held me down
Now a-days I rock the mic I'm getting paid for that
And all the shit I been through I'm getting paid for that
Always said I would make it, wish you could see me now
But if I tried to tell her, she probably wouldn't believe me now

[Chorus]</pre>
