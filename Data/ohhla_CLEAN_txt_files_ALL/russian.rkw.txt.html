[Lord Superb]
I was blacked out with shades at the wake of my man
He's so grand, Had plans to go legit but couldn't quit
Misfit mentalities lead to death young, Hold your tongue
Don't get strung and fall victim to the street life
For real it's real, Still we blast steel
Write your will cause we will, Kill at will when it's real
Cream Team is the sun's equation, In this nation of free-basin
Crimes we be lacin, Keys get cut like Jason
Lifes we erasin, He got a lead donation at Jay Street train station
In the theater, I saw the drama go on
They actin like it can't happen, I yapped em did you clap em
That's confidential information, I move like Perry Mason
Inside Pappy Mason, Raekwon gave me education
He said it's one nation, Power in his bitch station
Queens was mine like, Fiends was mine
And we aint pussy, Murder seeds we hot
Never divid, Even if our dreams collide, Yall on the other side

[Raekwon]
Thermometers hot, Shit boilin
The cast of Troy, Gun on my lap boy, Black boys shoot moist
Python linger from the Nike armor
The Prince Charmer, Select big armor now it's horror
Multi, Say it again, We regulate and take your pies
Rae had a mask on and blue eyes
Dirty work technique, Smoother the crime out like jerk meat
Merkin in the burnt three, He hurt me
Wild iris, Slide twist to Cyrus, Benz boat pirates
The ocean blue Nikes on, The livest
Blast sharks, Cliques like Noah's ark with darts
Me, Brush and cut it out in seventeen parts
The blood version, Three hundred rock watch surgeon
Broke, My man hold me, We all hold totes, Bring it on huh
The telethon, Seance, Smooth like suede on a baby arm
All grey on, The hygienic, Grinch list on my wish list
Gettin dusted up, Quick to stick ninety-seven up
There go Meryl Lynch mits, Brownsville bitch
Light the switch, Watch to ice ship, Shallah priceless
Big fish eat little fish faggot, Go head and try to rag it
Me, I just throw it down bag it, We blow holy
Roll a Dutch, Shout out to Power Cypher yeah</pre>
