Intro: 
Can't hold on.

Hook:
Hold on is what they say
But I say open up your hands and let it fly away
Until the day it comes back and it was meant to be
Take a look at the lovely gift the world has sent to me
Don't suffer you got to maintain
The rougher the storm gets the more they complain
They don't aim 
They shoot sporadaically
Panicky and so dramatically 
He ran frantically
Summarized by the look in his eyes
He couldn't hold on after one too many tries

Verse 1:
He held on tight
He put his arm around it and he squeezed with all his might
Don't fight
You should let it go
And sooner than you think it will be right back at your door
Open it up if your open up to learn
Got your head between your legs hoping it returns
They're not concerned
They're so continuous
No matter what my opinion is it's all strenuous
Summarized by the look in his eyes
He couldn't hold on after one too many tries
She held on tighter
She put her arms around it because she knew it would excite her
Don't fight her
You should let it go
And sooner than you think it will be back at your door
Open it up if you're open up to learn
Got your head between your legs hoping it returns
They're not concerned they're so continuous 
No matter what my opinion is it's all strenuous
Summarize because she was not wise
She couldn't hold on after one too many tries

Hook

Verse 2:
They hold on tight
They put their arms around it and they squeezed with all their might
Don't fight
You should let it go
And sooner than you think it will be right back at your door
Open it up if you're open up to learn
Got your head between your legs hoping it returns
They're not concerned they're so continuous
No matter what my opinion is it's all strenuous
Summarized by the look in their eyes
They couldn't hold on after one too many tries</pre>
