[Master P talking]
Ronzo, shut the door on that Cougar partner

Yo G you wanna hit (Yeah, let me hit that shit, sssss) [* Coughs *]
Man this shit so, shit
Yo, yo put that smoke out man, there go 5-0

[Master P]
Ooh, I'm with it
Smooth, if you a sucker ya better move on
Ya see it's P just flowin' with the microphone
Keyon layin' the tracks to the dope beat
The mixin' and scratchin' done by my nigga G
We a down crew, act a fool
You run up and down, I had to down this fool
But I'm makin' records down in the studio
I had to show the fuckin' world that I was dope
It's time to get paid
I'm sellin' world wide, yeah P is on a straight rise
Bitches on the jock, I'm makin' it
Niggas suck my dick, I know ya fakin' it
Ya punk motherfuckin' game ain't set to right
Check it out, hit chu' with a left and a right
I got tops and tops that means dollars
And all you motherfuckin' bitches just holla
I'm on the set of school and act servin'
In other words, me and my partners we just pervin'

[Hook]
Ha, ha we just pervin'
Ya know what I'm sayin', Keyon niggas didn't think we could do this

Yeah, we on a ride, we just pervin'

[Master P talking]

[* Beat Changes *]

Yo Ken bring me out one of those ol' funky base lines

[* DJ scratching *]

You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

[* Beat starts *]

A message to the underground
That mean dope fiends, pimps, prostitues
Gangstas, yankers, murderers, school boys
Mamas, papas you know what I'm sayin'
Suckers, niggas who talk shit
All you motherfuckers who think ya wanna be low down and dirty
Know what I'm sayin' you motherfuckers listen up
Cause there's a new fuckin' king in town know what I'm sayin'
With that hardcore, pimp, rap shit
And his name is Master P
Keep ya motherfuckin' eyes open cause if I ever catch ya slippin'
Ya creep and ya crip to my motherfuckin' bullets ya caught
Ya know what I'm sayin' that means ya lost
But I got one motherfuckin' thing to say
Ya know what I'm sayin' don't play dumb
Cause if ya talk shit on the P, ya get dumped in a fuckin' trunk
Ya know what I mean, case closed, think about it

[* Crowd cheering *]
