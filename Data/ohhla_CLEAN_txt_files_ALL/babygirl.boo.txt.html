Baby girl
Baby girl
She's cute
She's fine
She's sexy
She's mine
Good heart
Real smart
Got her head on right
All good from the hood
Stay together
We could blow up like dynamite
Baby girl
Gonna mob on the block
Keep her thang on lock
And oh my
She's so tight
Baby girl
Cook a damn good meal
And I think we'll
Blow up like dynamite

[Gotti]
C'mon girl get with me
Let's see the city
You can stop by
Let me see them tig ol' bitties
We can stay in the city
Let me play with the kitty
Never been a minute man
All day with the kitty
Why you think chicks pray to get with me
Enough for that
Wanted a rough ? smack
Chicks cuff my gats
Plus my gats
Hustle my crack
Never juggle my crack
Don't trust em but fuck em
What's fucking with that?
I'm the ill last trill
Last real
Last nigga
Get mills fast nigga
Built the last nigga
It's just me and my chicks
Give em my whips
They from a hood near you
Ain't gotta get em no tricks
They don't give me no look
Unless they spoke to the dick
Keep a ride or die chick that like to smoke a spliff
Put it all in the air
Smoke dro to get
I'm drinking H2O
I get you Mo and Cris
Yeah

[TQ]
Baby girl
She's cute
She's fine
She's sexy
She's mine
Good heart
Real smart
Got her head on right
Baby girl
All good from the hood
Stay together
We could blow up like dynamite
Baby girl
Gonna mob on the block
Keep her thang on lock
And oh my
She's so tight
Baby girl
Cook a damn good meal
And I think we'll
Blow up like dynamite

[Boo]
I'm a sucka for them ghetto women
But I don't love em
I just love to fuck em
An' I don't trust em
You're looking at a hustler baby
That's the reason why you always see me in that new Mercedes
When she look at my face
She think I'm a baby
But she notice my papes and
Love how I made it
It was made to spin
Don't help me save it
Ma get three of ya friends
Let's jump off crazy
We can hit LA
On a private jet
Go to the L'Ermitage
For some private sex
I'ma smoke some haze
You can pop some Ex
Just think about tonight and forget the next
Girl
You know how CMR do
Ain't no love boo
Just for our crew
Sorry mammie
That's just how thugs do
Some chicks on their way
So it's time to lose you

[TQ]
Baby girl
She's cute
She's fine
She's sexy

Good heart

Got her head on right
Baby girl
All good from the hood
Stay together
We could blow up like dynamite
Baby girl
Gonna mob on the block
Keep her thang on lock
And oh my

And I think we'll
Blow up like dynamite

Baby girl
I think I want you on my team
[Gotti]
Baby girl let me see you dance
Boo &amp; Gotti wanna see you dance
[TQ]
Baby girl
Don't you wanna ride with me
[Gotti]
Tonight you gotta leave your man
Baby girl you gotta understand (baby girl)

[Boo]
I loves them girls that'll hold that work
And put they money in they bra
And not they purse
Gimme brain in the car without saying a word
While I ride through the hood getting high as a bird
She don't even get mad when I don't answer my phone
She just like to brag that she been in my home
Love to bounce dat ass when she put on a thong
Baby girl so street I can't leave her alone

[Gotti]
I like Keisha &amp; Tasha with they summer weaves
Lisa sitting on the porch eating sunflower seeds
Here I come flossin a Porsche at top speed
Of course I get them ?
While they stay on their knees
I leave them with no voice
Only harmony
When they hum on these
Big N-U-T's
Cause they into g's
Cause they into me
No wonder my girls
Why they envy me

[TQ]
Baby girl
She's cute

Keep her thang on lock
And oh my

And I think we'll
Blow up like dynamite
