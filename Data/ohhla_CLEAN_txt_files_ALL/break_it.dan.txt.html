Typed by: AZ Lyrics

(Go, Go, Go, Go, Go, Go)
Don't stop 'til you break it, break it
Don't stop 'til you break it, break it
Don't stop 'til you break it, break it

Who the fuck is you fucking with
I been in the dirt like a catcher's mitt
I'm activist on Actavis
Won't smack a bitch, but I'm like a pimp
Long ass cudi, eatin' lots of shrimp
Got a wig and bring it back
She go in and bring it back
And make that booty go
Ain't no way gonna sleep with a whitey
Rob my nigga ho so furry
Ghetto Bill Murray, that's a whole nother story
What a nightmare when you see talking to your chick
Put this in your nosehole/nose, ho, then start sniffin'
Put this on your tongue ho, then start lickin
Y'all niggas shroomin', y'all better fall back [?]

Ain't no time to be playin'
Spit champagne when you hear what I'm sayin'
Exhale kush when I breathe on the mic
Everytime I rock like a diamond heist
Drop the lights when I drop the jewel
With that work, we make it twerk
Don't end up on your homeboy's shirt
Cause you popped you a pill, now you feelin like a ho
Now you goin berserk
I'm just tryin to see her shake it
Don't stop girl, just break it
Stick it out, then bring it back
Make that booty go - go go go
Don't stop til you break it

Girl just gimme your all [x3]
Hell no you can't have it all
Girl just gimme your all [x3]
Hell no you can't have it all

She had me on that wall
Drink in my hand with her ass on my balls
Sweatin, hot, and we rollin
Phone off service, got a couple missed calls
Girl don't stop just get it
After this, ho, I'mma lick it
Rubbin on your stomach while I'm kissin on your neck
Thing gettin hard while I'm rubbin on your breasts
Girl you make me wanna do things
When you grind all on that ding-a-ling
Make me wanna rip off your pants
Put my hand between your legs
Rubbin on them nipples
Wanna make that pussy dribble
Wanna bend that ass over then hit it from the back
Girl make that booty go

With that work, we make it twerk
Don't end up on your homeboy's shirt
Cause you popped you a pill, now you feelin like a ho
Now you goin berserk
I'm just tryin to see her shake it
Don't stop girl, just break it
Stick it out, then bring it back
Make that booty go - go go go
Don't stop til you break it

Girl just gimme your all [x3]
Hell no you can't have it all
Girl just gimme your all [x3]
Hell no you can't have it all

She had me on that wall
Drink in my hand with her ass on my balls
Sweatin, hot, and we rollin
Phone off service, got a couple missed calls
Girl don't stop just get it
After this, ho, I'ma lick it
Rubbin on your stomach while I'm kissin on your neck
Thing gettin hard while I'm rubbin on your breasts
Girl you make me wanna do things
When you grind all on that ding-a-ling
Make me wanna rip off your pants
Put my hand between your legs
Rubbin on them nipples
Wanna make that pussy dribble
Wanna bend that ass over then hit it from the back
Girl make that booty go

With that work, we make it twerk
Don't end up on your homeboy's shirt
Cause you popped you a pill, now you feelin like a ho
Now you goin berserk
I'm just tryin to see her shake it
Don't stop girl, just break it
Stick it out, then bring it back
Make that booty go - go go go
Don't stop til you break it</pre>
