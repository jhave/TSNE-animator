[Intro]
Our mission is to boldly go, where no MC, or group
has ever gone before -- EVER! EVER!
(What the hell is this shit?) Binary system {*scratches*}
(What the hell is this shit?) Binary system

[OneBeLo]
Yo, you wack bastards, you wanna know how I killed your fathers
On the battlefield I grab the steel like William Wallace
A +Braveheart+ swingin my sword's a work of art
Every verse I spark, deserve the Purple Heart
You can't get with the, cold temperature
OneBeLo'll turn a wack artist purple like the Arctic Circle
Frostbit from the words I spit
You ain't got enough raps/wraps in your first-aid kit
to treat yourself, too late, you chose your fate
You beat yourself, cumin like you masturbate
And I won't hesitate to embarrass ya
Cause on the microphone you +Do-little+, like Eddie Murphy's character
The only paraphernalia I need to rock the spot
is one hip-hop fan, and it don't stop (it's all I need)
Without a mic, without a beat, or a DJ (I don't need that, I don't need that)
Without a pen, pad, without a blunt, a fifth of E&amp;J (I don't need that)
Without a doubt I still turn it out without a de-lay
On a track to beat your whole team without a relay
Without a problem, so don't expect nothin lesser
Droppin hip-hop, I blow spots like Uncle Fester

[Chorus]
"Check the ground while my beats just break it down" - Raekwon
{*scratched*: Binary Star, Binary Star"}
"Check the ground while my beats just break it down" - Raekwon
{*scratched*: Binary Star, Bi-Bi-Binary Star"}
"Check the ground while my beats just break it down" - Raekwon
{*scratched*: Bi.. Binary Star, Bi-Bi-Binary Star"}
"Ch-Check the ground while my beats just break it down" - Raekwon
"Lights, camera, ac-tion.." {*scratched*: Binary Star"}
"Yo, you gotta respect them"

[Senim Silla]
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful or cause my show's live
And your jam's a damn funeral, you wack on the rec' of pharmaceuticals
My usual, you may be feelin me
But the feelin ain't mutual, think you can try
sellin nothin short of delusional, many a guy went there
But to no avail, got you all in +check+
My game will never go +stale+, I got "All the Right Moves"
like Tom Cruise and don't know the definition of fail
I'm constantly on the incline, star goal in mind
Get ours in time, my crew bout to shine
on these cats like UV rays so get your sunblock
Bolted down, ain't no way you can unlock
We concoct the rock from explosive materials
Natural born Sillas that commit acts and serial
We're flamin 'em, and workin around like venereal
Binary, the genuine article, reign imperial

[Chorus]
"Check the ground while my beats just break it down" - Raekwon
{*scratched*: Bi-Bi-Binary Star, Binary Star"}
"Check the ground while my beats just break it down" - Raekwon
{*scratched*: Binary Star, Bi.. Binary Star"}
"Ch-ch-check the ground while my beats just break it down" - Raekwon
{*scratched*: Binary Star, Bi-Bi-Binary Star"}
"Ch-ch-check the ground while my beats just break it down" - Raekwon
{*scratched*: Bi-Bi-Binary Star"} "As long as you call us your favorite MC"

[OneBeLo]
Yo, I rock jeans, hip-hop fiends (fiends) blow hot steam (steam)
We got schemes (schemes) the terrorist bomb scenes
It's obscene (obscene) the MC who's not seen
I got dreams, like Don King, PEACE
Binary Star hit you like a SWAT team
As you promotin hip-hop with Noxzem' always talkin bout you got some +cream+
You make a better slot machine
I make a better flag cause I stay on top of things
I got the means, to generate lots of screams
Bitin MCs like Tyson in the boxin ring
I told you once before not to push me
Word is +Bond+, I'm like 007 in "Octopussy"

[Senim Silla]
The aqua authors, H-2-O flow
Awful aqua that floods the menstrual
It drowns the underground, give tracks to run around
And mics to squeeze play, exhaust the DJ
All in a day's work, doin my slang thang
"Word Play Expert," the title I maintain
Pulitzer Prize rhymes, novel idealist
Silla's a realist, microphone check 1-2
and so forth, and use the force
Hold down the fort, represent the North
Hold up the torch, make sure the whole world see this
Mic Jesus'll walk on water to make believers

[Outro]
"Check the ground while my beats just break it down" - Raekwon
"Ch-ch-check the ground while my beats just break it down" - Raekwon
"Ch-check.. check the ground while my beats just break it down" - Raekwon
{*scratched*: Binary Star, Bi-Bi-Bi.."}
"Check the ground.. check, check, check, check the ground" - Raekwon
{*scratched*: Binary Star, Bi-Bi-Binary system"}
"Check, check the ground while my beats just break it down" - Raekwon
{*scratched*: Binary Star, Bi-Bi-Binary Star"}
