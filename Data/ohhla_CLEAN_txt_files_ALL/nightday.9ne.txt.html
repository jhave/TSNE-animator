Night And Day
eheheh
Tech N9ne, Baby

[Tech N9ne]
Other rap is out commission
to the mouth they 'bout to listen
do it up Reroute conditions make you bounce without permission
Check it out we 'about to glisten
bring 'em out we scout them chickens
We don't need no strife in this cause life's a bitch
never doubt we thizzlin'
Better triple lock your vixens
cause I make them rock with diction
Let go inhibitions &amp; hittin' this one with all the fixins
So put the knife away party your life away
Hardly evil cause we the party people night and day

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Night and day (we we we what?) Party palet
Party hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy

[Tech N9ne}
Life's a bianca, so me and Cali create the Funkra
Don't interput me during me mantra
Hunts for party chicks in Shreelanca
Past them hookers with fat ass like Ashton Kutcher we punk'd ya
Dash to liquor sto past me no Michelob bastard
Half on the Henndo &amp; Captain wit it cause we masters
Heineken bottles behind a thin model with collagen
Kind in Colorado benign like rollo she swallowin'
Tarantula with fruit punch vodka and cranberry
sara cara terra bou lou so I can stand barely
Yeager bombs Goldenschlager or you can feel the pain
of Cuervo Silver Patron Tequila, Dos Equis Corona Sapporo
Give me the Pies Porter Goldstofchen out of the bottle
Gobble the Malibu baby I don't mean to startle you
We do what we gotta do to get the party inside of you

[Chorus]

[Tech N9ne]
I hit the party with 50 niggas we blood hounds
We come to kick it with bianca's and tear the club down
If these hataz trippin' cause their women love clowns
At the back of the club stickin' she making love sounds
Have women and we'll travel she will straddle
Saddle up bitches cause this is a real battle
I'm loving to palet rock &amp; roll even Sade
Playin' when layin' having our nasty little swaray
Party like it's your last day to get your last say
Take the pathway to ecstasy hit you the fast way
get so drunk I might Just have to crawl to  night
I'm 'bout to rock it shake it rip it up and ball tonight EEYAH
Take a look off in my eyes I come with no disguise
I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt Imma big surprise
Gotta party right away we can hit your hide away
KCMO is just a flight away - Night and Day

[Chorus]

[Outro:Tech N9ne]
Yeah
When it comes to partying
Strange Music, we the best (the best)
eheh
We party all day all night, baby
Tech N9ne
Tip you bartenders, PUNKS
Drink till your drunk
With Tech N9ne
We the party people night and day
Living crazy is the only way

Night and Day</pre>
