[Frank Ocean]
A tornado flew around my room, before you came
Excuse, the mess it made, it u-sually doesn't rain
in Southern California much, like Arizona
My eyes don't, shed ,tears, but boy,they pour when

[Chorus 1]
I'm thinking 'bout you (ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinking 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus 2]
Or do you not think so far, ahead?
Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, oooh
Or do you not think so far, ahead?
Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, oooh

[Frank Ocean]
No I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in I-daho, since you think
I don't love you, I just thought you were cute - that's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Frank Ocean]
Yes of course; I remember how could I forget - how you feel?
You know you were my first time - a new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black &amp; white

[Chorus 2] </pre>
