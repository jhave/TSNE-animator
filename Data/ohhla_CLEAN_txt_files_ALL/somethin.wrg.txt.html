[Warren G]
Suckas be hatin when they know we makin cash
I don't give a fuck I'm still down and ready to smash
Haters be sayin Warren G fell off
How is that when I put the beach and Snoop on the map
The only way they comin to jack you
You better come right to save case and glocks on site
Ain't know body I know checkin for you
I got gold platinum look at my wrist fool
It's a million and one ways to what people say
They gone say what they say but they fail to display
Where I went wrong, can't I do right
In the city I face snitches, with no britches
Quick to judge and hold a grudge
and all this time I showed them love

Hook: [Warren G]
This is somthing fo you to bounce to
It's for the summer time I'm a hit switches for you
This is somthing for you to bounce to
This is somthing for you to bounce to
This is somthing for you to bounce to
This is somthing for you to bounce to

(Soopafly)
It's them niggas from the LBC
and we back with the stone cold mack 
Cuz the summer time bout to crack
Bud and the bitches come free
It's so lovely dippin wit the Dub G G'd up blazin weed up
Rollin wit a shooby doo
A nine at least let alone die in peace on the eastside
These niggas really keepin' it G
If they don't then they wount, fuck a hater nigga I keep a heat
I am P Soopafly bond to go double plat
Fuck a rat I'm a show you where the trouble at
Step to close I let the duce go strut off wit two hoes
Look how the jucie flows
It's a party and the eyes on me
As I fall in with a small grin, talkin with the tall kain in my hand
I'm so cool, I swear I'm do that damn thang
So vicious with my champain bitches

G'd dub what's really crackin with you
I just signed with universal this game so persal 
What's up with you and your boy Snoop
That's my dogg for life how you figure we ain't tight
What's up with 2-1-3
It's comin so start your tape that's runnin
They wanna know is you keepin it G'd
As big Lou Dogg from 21st street
It's amazin how time flys 
Some time I sit back and wonder why
Most people don't keep it tight
and most G'z don't G it right
and me I always bounce it right
Make you wiggle that ass till you get it right
Baby what you perkin for
Mo' bounce to the ounce if you wan't some more
