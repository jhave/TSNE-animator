[Chorus]
Bangin' that gangsta music
Dippin' with my forty-five
You niggaz gon' make me lose it
Fuckin' with a Dogg Pound nigga for life, yeah
For life, yeah... you better watch what you say
Livin' on the West Coast California, hey

[Soopafly]
Hey yo guess who's back
It's them niggaz you don't come around unless you strapped
Check it - Daz and Soopa', we pressin' the fact
We givin' knockouts to niggaz plus a lesson in rap
You shoulda - kept your mouth closed, left it at that
Now we pullin' out the weapons, the tec and the mack
You shoulda - played the back like a regular cat
Ya fucked up, you let your heart get ahead of your raps
Now we all up on yo' dome like a Mexican hat
Arriba bitch, I'll separate your neck from your back
Punk nigga, I'ma tell ya straight to your face
Right before I take off bombin' straight to your face

Lookin' all around town but really don't see no

Duck quick nigga, talk and get your strut hit nigga

Slow quit it, ya - steppin' on the wrong turf
We cock back with the glock strap

[Daz]
I'm a G in the highest degree
I told the B-U-L-L-shit to back off me
I ain't havin' it, let it smoke and I'll smoke yo' ass
I finally can relax at last, on a mission on a serious task
The police wanna know who's under the mask
Who makin', breakin' yourself for the jewelry and cash
like Luda' I'm 2 Furious and 2 damn Fast
(And this is how I'm gon' do ya
Everyone around here who smoke buddah)
I stay high all the time, double my money in this rap game
On point, hot to death, homie what a for sure aim
God damn it's a motherfuckin' shame
How niggaz keep kickin' up my name
You ain't nobody, I turn the book, rip the page
I'm at the point where I'm about to get paid
I crave for this, misbehave with him and draw down on him
I had to learn... I had to stay focused
This goes out, to you know who
Who try to do what we do, and try to be like my crew
You fake ass gangstas, you'll never be true
This is Dogg Pound Gang (Soopafly, Kurupt and Snoop)
So back up or get rolled on, we love to ride
(We smoke kush, smoke purple 'cause we love to get high)
Cause I'm -

[Chorus]
Bangin' that gangsta music
Dippin' with my forty-five
You niggaz gon' make me lose it
Fuckin' with a Dogg Pound nigga for life, yeah
For life, yeah... you better watch what you say
Livin' on the West Coast California, hey

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm with my kinfolk, we blowin' big dope
We on this big boat, this shit is no joke
We on the West Coast, yeah we got the best smoke
Baby girl jumped out the boat and did the breast stroke
And now a nigga floatin', but on a different note
Cause 'Fly just flew in and cuz bought some different smoke
So, so, tell me what a nigga paid
I'll back-slap ya, I'm your papi, what that nigga say?
You better keep it on the low or don't speak at all
And tell Shameka and Konica I'ma freak 'em dogg
See when I ride up, you know I fire it up
I throw a party on the block and get ya wired up
See it's the Big Bo$$, I'm in the big house
With the bitch who suck dick with the big mouth
I set the big trap for the big mouse
I left him stuck him for his cheese
Now I breeze, nigga please, bang on

[Chorus]
Bangin' that gangsta music
Dippin' with my forty-five
You niggaz gon' make me lose it
Fuckin' with a Dogg Pound nigga for life, yeah
For life, yeah... you better watch what you say
Livin' on the West Coast California, hey
