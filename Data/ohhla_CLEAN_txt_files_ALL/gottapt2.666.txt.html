[Chorus]
Psycho in da {*3X*}
Cut with the mask and the pistol grip
I gotta touch 'em {*4X*}

[Lord Infamous]
This shit is begining to come into focus
But no one can figure out Infamous murderous of psychosis
Trippin I'm runnin the darkness
I'm loadin barettas I'm jackin yo' hoe shit
A posse of satanic mothers we comin to smuggle
And leave them in puddles of plasma
I'm comin for stashes for cash
The blast until everyone in here passed out
My fellow man you cannot comprehend strength of the devil military killers
Execution to death you will send us no harmony
Now enter your head through the pillow
The Tre-six nigga comin to injure you at nightfall
Give it up or this desert eagle shall make them fall up on you all
(Come on mayn, you finna give me them ?? nigga)
Naw bitch... (aww dog ???)
Naw bitch... (a couple of hundred mayn)
(Just a couple of hundred mayn a couple hundred) Check it out my nig
I'm gonna kill you anyway you won't need none of that shit
Ran through the backyard jumped the gate to the corner of the back street
Hopped into the steamer tossed the fuckin stash behind the seat
I'm comin to rush 'em son, crush 'em son, buck my gun
I'm gonna reach out and touch someone

[Chorus]

[Crunchy Black]
I got a problem, money dividends, gotta solve them
The only thing going through my head is murder and rob them
I heard they got cash, I gotta touch they ass
Quick fast in a hurry get away with a fuckin dash
Every night I sit and think on why these hoes keep playin with me
They gonna make me click them clicka click
and they don't wanna see my bad side
? they gonna make me transform to another man
And make they motherfuckin ass do the devil dance
Crunchy Black bitch, comin at you hoes easy come easy go
Easily we kickin doors, I gotta touch 'em

[Koopsta Knicca]
In my fuckin head I vision blood be red
As I chopped off his fuckin head
Left him dead for them bitches
A psycho at large
Some bitch gone step to this bomber squad
I'm harder nigga when I click you will feel like a prey that was predator
{?} for them paramedics
See wait for the Koopsta scare 'em
Sk-skinny {?} in the pimpin'
Now waitin for that Armageddeon
Bitch

[Chorus]

[Juicy J]
I hooked up with a freak down
Niggah's from the M-town
Then we started robbin outta town makin them lay it down
Touchin crackers wit a 12 gauge to they fuckin back
Stickin them liqour stores, robbin banks, plenty car-jacks
Snatchin old ladies purse knockin nigga's to the dirt
My 9 gone make yo body hurt
I'm go put your body in hearst
Call me a playa hater traitor, what you want bitch
Strapped wit them thangs on your ass hear them guns clicks
Inside job strictly robbin so you better beware
Other nigga wit a gat a mask raise 'em in the air

[DJ Paul]
Now raise 'em up an down for the killah man as a youngster
Stickin these tricks up daily you trippin I'm still a hustler
Cuttin class don't make my snooze behind the barrel
Shootin crowds I hit it up in a honeycomb
And smoke a fuckin pamper house
Hollerin at my brother Phil D I gotta get straight
No thang mayn he got me straight that thang fool be boomin weight
Hoppin on my skooter with my ski mask an my deuce duece
All blue joggin suit tube socks and ???
But now I'm gettin old and comin clean is what I'm hopin'
And now that I got boulder dope girls are what I'm scopin bitch
This is the touch...</pre>
