House Of Horrors

"Hey there, do you like excitement?" (yeah)
"Do you like suspense?" (uh huh)
"Do you like Nel Carter?" (no)
"Good cuz you won't find her here, this is the house of horrors
And for you it's absolutely free, step right in" (thanks)
"Say no more stupid ass, your face says enough"

[Violent J]
Woboogawoo WAAA!! Welcome to the House of Horrors
Were you born in a barn, shut the fuckin door
You see, damn, cuz I'm about to scare you
Blubablubabluba, okay now I dare you
Close your eyes, open up your mouth, and count to ten
Don't wanna, huh, cuz you know my nuts are going in
I'm twisted, I'll cut your finger off, and stick in your butt
Awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa and glue it shut
This is when I get crazy, lemme show you something
Brrrr! You know what that means, it don't mean nothin, haha
But it scared you cuz people don't be doing that shit
But me brrr! bitch brrr! I'm all about it (brrrr!!!)
Guess what I'm a serial killer, it's a bad habit
I killed Tony, Lucky Charms, the silly rabbit, UH!
    Cut the lights, see that shit, I'm glowing
Alright, I'm done, turn em back, wait, where you going?
Welcome to the house of horrors

[Chorus (1x)]
Comes from within me
Comes from within me, horrors, eh

"Honey, I'm not having a good time"
"I know. Come on, this must be the way out."

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Hey, what the fuck, come here guys, grab a chair
Don't mind me drinkin' my beer in my underwear
Come on, let's play some cardback, I just gotta story
"Hey keep it down in there Shaggs, what the hell?" sorry
Look at that shit, "what?", you almost got me grounded
I'm a have to take your forehead and pound it
I'll bend you over and tie you up to a pole
And stretch your nuts back and fling em up your butthole
I'm a phantom, listen to me, ahhhhh
That didn't do it? How about this? AHHHH!!!!
I'm so scary, they call me Joey Terrifying
Did you know that?, "yeah", no you didn't I was lying

"I represent Igors
I'm yelling in town
I'm coming out of southwest
WICKED CLOWNS!!!"

[Violent J]
Bathroom? yeah, it's right there down the hall
Don't flush it though, I'll make dinner for you all
(mumbles) I'm possessed too
Wait a minute, eh, don't leave me yet, hey!
Welcome to the House of Horrors

[Chorus (2x)]

"Honey?"
"What?"
"I'm scared"
"I know, sweety, come on"

[Violent J]
Jump Steady, Nate the Mack, lemme tell you something
With Billy Bill and Rude Boy, what about em, nothing
They're my boys, I just had to give em props
And together we form the cyclops
Hahahahaha look at you, haha, you're a bitch
Should I let your ass go? hahahaha, no
I'll let your bitch out, but you get the bone
Run along sugar tits, he ain't coming home

"Don't let the door hit you where the good lord split you, bitch"
