Intro: Cube

In every game, we gotta have the brains and the muscle
The game and the hustle... to be real on these streets
So here you have it, the Brainiac
<female voice=""> Ice Cube
With the Maniac
<female voice=""> Mack 10

Mack &amp; Cube: Yay-y-yay! X2

Verse One

Ice Cube:

While ya'll niggas think about the papé
I think about which Titanic I'mma sink
The iceberg, with the nice words
I slice verbs and predicets, ghetto etiquette
Y'all better get, this dime-mega shit
The Braniac, the theory be conspiracy
Keep my eye on the birdie, but never get my hands dirty
Verbally call the Maniac and his attack dogs
Signing contracts with automatic jack clause

Mack 10:

I get full of their shit and take flight on these niggas
'Bout to show these so-called
Wig-splitters and nigg-hitters
Who the man be, and what the number one clique is
Let my nuts hang on these busts
And hoes see how big my dick is
Maniac Mack 10 always keep the heat toted
And teflon tips keep the .44 loaded 
Straight quoted in nine-trey, by the dime
Now we connected
He said, "Mack, when you westsidin' and ridin' is expected"
So I...

Chorus

Cube: Maniac with Brainiac, Mack 10!
Mack: You do the drivin', while I do the jackin'
Cube: Maniac with Brainiac, Mack 10!
Mack: My nigga if you plot it, best believe I got it
Mack: And it's on... feel the chrome

Verse 2

Ice Cube:

You in the Stargate, trying t'escape, it's not an option
Got torture techniques for them lies, don't ever lie
Just put the car in drive, we can go ride- get this money
Determined as the Energized Bunny, make a left
Underground parking, guns start sparkin'
ATF enemies all around start chargin'
Tryin' to fuck up my new suit and my weekend
Ask me what you want, you bitch! I ain't speakin'

Mack 10:

Shit, I gives a fuck what the next nigga think
(?) gives a fuck how much bitch you say you ain't
It's like this on mine, potna
By all means, I got the ball
So it's your life, not mine nigga, so you make the call
Now, I can blow your brains out, punk and act the fuckin' fool
Or you can hand your guns over, and let everything be cool
But know this: I won't hesitate to peel your wig back
I'm off that wet-bomb and the whole fifty yak
It's Mack the Maniac, nigga

Chorus

Verse 3

Ice Cube:

What's the plan? Everything thought out
Everything bought out, like Bill Gates
My niggas love steel weights
I'm still great, after 12 muthafuckin' years
I (?) your ass after 12 muthafuckin' beers
I act kind to my peers and everybody that listen
They know when the Brainiac's missin'
The big fish, hanging with the chicken hawk
Got all the haters, claimin' that they wanna talk

Mack 10:

You argue wit 'em and negotiate, and I really wanna kill 'em
I'm tired of the bullshit, man I really wanna peel 'em
Dog, I knew they were scareless
'Cause my brother Snoop told us
So fuck the money and the dope that they punk-ass owe us
Now when I see 'em, it ain't no question it's all the way on
But I'mma wait in front of they momma house
For that one nigga to get home
And when I gun, watch his body jump
And it's all going to amaze me
To see his own self
Layin' there with his own brains on the pavement

Chorus

Outro: Mack 10

And it's on... keep takin' 'til it's gone
And it's on... feel the wrath of the chrome
Wessiiide!
Ice Cube the Brainiac
Mack 10 the Maniac
