(Intro, RBX)
Once again
The circle
Continue to hit'chu with these massive hits
Ya know
We gon' do it somethin like this
For all them busters out there
Check this out

(Hook x2, RBX)
Hey
We came here to ride
Falling back to ready
And set to collide
Niggas you won't know my nephew died
Suicide, it's a suicide

(Verse 1, Warren G)
I'm deadly as ever
Ready for whatever
Tryin'a keep my pockets heavy on the cheddar
Got nothin to prove, just really expressin myself
While y'all niggas in the studio stressin yaself
Ya got to do it, so why not do it big?
Drop the music, and spit fluid to they wig
Under dig, I'ma split the game in half
And leave 'em all mad, like Warren what'chu done did?
Hey, we came here to ride
Never slippin, Beretta sittin on my side
Blaze up, cause I'm tryin'a raise up, and flow
I came up, from broke, to papered up
Don't test me, I bust like a twelve-gauge sawed-off
And hoes jump on stage and rip they drawers off
And I see through, all that's see through
Make up a weave in ya head this evening, but hey

(Hook)

(Verse 2, Warren G)
Sworn to the streets
Born in the beach
Armed with the heat
Mourning my peeps
Makin niggas respect mine
I came to collect mine
Comin through with the Tech-9
Lettin my neck shine
Might let a nigga slide with a pass
But next time, I might disconnect his neck from his spine
Run up and catch him from behind and stretch him
We squeeze triggas like ketchup
Wet'cha whole stretch up
Scared of the truth
You fear it, don't wanna hear it
Til' the Smithsons bust
Then you listen up
Cause I'ma tell it like it is
Like it was, or like it always will be
Give a fuck if you feel me

(Hook)

(Verse 3, Warren G)
Who am I?
W-A, double R, E-N to the motherfuckin G
Suicide, niggas hang they self
Might as well bend over, and finger-bang they self
Sell they soul for the fame and wealth
And end up broke and lonely
Nobody to blame but'cha self
But me, I keep it all business
Cause this is business, can I get a witness?
See I been chillin like a villain
With a million and my children
Plottin on revealin what the game been concealin
I got a little older and learned a bit
Applied the effort, and earned a grip
Now I notice it's a hater, in every circle
As I roll another Vega, heavy with purple
Take a puff and inhale
And hold it til' it gets stale
In my chest, exhale my stress
My nigga R-B-X
