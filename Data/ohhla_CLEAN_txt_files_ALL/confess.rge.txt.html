Make a joyful noise unto the lord, all ye lame
Serve the lord with gladness
Come before his presence with singin
Know, ye that the lord is one
It is he that has made us, not we ourselves
We are his people *Bells begin to ring; wind blows*
In the sheep of his pasture
Enter, enter, enter, enter
Enter, enter, enter, enter
Enter *Music starts*

Robin, Robin, Robin
Robin, Robin, pray

Robin, Robin, Robin
Robin, Robin, pray


Verse 1:

Forgive me God, for I have forsaken thee
I'm not gonna say that it's the devil that's makin me
Do what I do, the things that I've done
Just because I'm young, and it's all for fun
I never really thought about the consequences
But ever since Eazy died, I said "Now Ima listen"
Yay, though I walk through the valleys of death
I open my eyes, they droppin like flies, my last breath
Might get snatched, taken, broke down I'm shaken
Shaken by that shit that's breakin
Down your nervous system
So, if you're nervous listen
Kissin cousins die by the dozens
Because I like good lovin will I burn in a oven
Fiery furnace
Cause sometimes the yearn gets
Tempting so I yield into temptation
Intoxication mixed with fornication
Face the nation, face the revelation the ending
Will I be caught up in the rapture 
Or will I be left behind because what I'm caught up in got me captured
Amazin Grace, could save a wretch like me
But a wretch like me feels that Hell is already my destiny (Why?)
Because I messed with He (Who?),him
He who sends them
The demons
I see em schemin amongst my dreamin
They tell me he awaits suddenly I awake
I got a funny feelin it wont be long before He
takes my soul that was the deal all for mass appeal
Dollar dollar bill, now my fate seems sealed
The nails in the coffin, he's coughin, I'm lookin
Through my iris
To see if he's got the virus
Paranoia starts to sink in 
Deranged thoughts start to blink in
And out of my mind playin tricks on me
Sufferin with suicidal tendencies, since ten plus three
On bended knee I ask what's intended for me cause I can't cope
Some tellin me I ain't shit, some tellin me I ain't got no hope
Confessions of a young girl stressin
Sittin alone sweatin, burnin cigarettes into my flesh
Not knowin where I'm going, Can't understand why I came
I can't stand the rain, so I'm self inflictin pain 
Gotta get a grip
Gotta hold on a little tighter to the end of this rope, before I slip
Into insanity
Lost within calamity
Forgive me for I know not what I do but what I've done
I confess with my tongue
To you
He who created heaven and earth, but still I'm still confused
I don't know what to do
Is there some way that you 
Could just clear my visions 
Can't see you with false prophets and religions
But I'm driven to find the force that keeps me livin
But ifn'I might be mistaken
They tell me I'll be held accountable and fried like bacon
But wait, when I didn't ask to come here
Why is this all unclear 
I can't understand, it all seems unfair
They tell me not to question God, but the question is
Will I make it to live another day cause times gettin hard
So you tell me to believe, have the faith of a mustard seed
Ask and I shall receive 
And you're all I need
Indeed, this may be true 
I'm tryin to find my link to you
But, for all the things I do, I might not even make it through
Because we're all born in sin, so nine times out of ten
We're all gonna die in sin, same thing all over again
But, I don't wanna fry God, I don't even wanna die
So many tears I cry, so many years I try
I know I've done wrong I know I sing the same ole song
But truly I seek a righteous way, that'll lead me to be strong
In spirit and mind, body and soul
Deliver me from evil make me whole
God take control
Before it's too late, before you turn me over to a reprobate mind
Before you cast me in a lake of fire with my kind
Of sinners, for I am a sinner, I confess
I pray you forgive me and do bless
My soul to the very end 
This I ask God forgive me

Hey God, can you hear me?
Can you see me?
I can see heaven there
Let me see, what's wrong with me
Hey God, come take a walk with me
Hey God, come have a talk with me
Hey God</pre>
