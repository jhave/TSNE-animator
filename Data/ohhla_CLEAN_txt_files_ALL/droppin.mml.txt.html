[VERSE 1]
When I get stupid to the point that I'm mentally mad
My rhymes start to flow, so I simply must brag
About my style that makes you vibrant, I keep drivin
Until the song turns me to a hip-hop giant
Me and Marley Marl, we're goin one on one
For any sucker rapper that chooses to come
And for me Craig G a/k/a The Kingpin
I drop science, can't you tell how I'm singing?
They hate how I tie my mic cord to a whip
Suckers just have to flip cause I'm so hip
Craig G and Marley Marl, we form the ultimate alliance
No sucker can deal when I'm droppin science

        (Get)
        (Get)
        (Get funky)

I'm droppin science

[VERSE 2]
Rappers: Ask yourself the same question
Why am I best in this profession?
Is it because you're scared to step to me, yo
Or the things Marley does in the studio?
I drop science as if I was Butterfingers
And I know there's not another singer
In this lifetime to kick the right rhyme
Cause there's not another rhyme quite like mine
And when it comes to havin showmanship
I really don't care who you go and get
Cause rappers hate me, I'm so defiant
And I can get stupid just by droppin science

        (Get)
        (Get)
        (Get funky)

I'm droppin science

[VERSE 3]
Livin larger than life, and what this means is
We'll be the dopest duo comin outta Queensbridge
Now crews hate us cause we're extraordinaire
For you to beat us? Hm, I think that's sort of rare
These rhymes are dope, that's how I transmit
And sized perfectly, so that they can fit
You're steppin to us? You need traction
Or you'll be another sucker missin in action
You hate to hear it? You'll learn to love it
My smokin rhymes, you always think of it
I eat MC's up like a pack of hungry lions
So step out my way, I'm droppin science

        (Get)
        (Get)
        (Get funky)

I'm droppin science

[VERSE 4]
The Vernon Posse along with me Craig G
Is gonna rock it till the crowd begs me
To kick the next verse, your context's worse
Like all the others, that's why I get respect first
And believe me, I'm never on on others
Cause as a member of Cold Chillin'/Warner Brothers
I do swear to uphold this
Title of rap to be the boldest
Among so many MC's
Yo Marley, yo we outta here?
(Yo money, let's breeze)
Alright

I'm droppin science</pre>
