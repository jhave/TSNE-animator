Bang-ba-da-ba-da-bang!
Somebody mussa told ya that we play around
My name is Kardinal my job is to kill any sound!
Murder everything walking put the evil underground
Guess who's back came with a crew
no lames in my Circle and we aiming at you!!
God bless cause this stress got me sippin that brew
All this success got me in a city near you
And the way that we flex will make your face screw
With my glamma campaign no making it rain
But the thunder making the world wonder HMMM?!
How come the kid ain't going under HMMM?!
God first then money and my family
WHO DAT?! Nigga can't nobody handle me
GEAH!! Front page but it ain't no scandal
People dead! Light that candle
Spark that good shit turn on the engine
Put it in gear my dear pay attention

Get ya grands up hands up, real niggas stand up PUT EM UP!!

Lemme see ya lighter! - Put it in the sky for me
Lemme see ya lighter! - Throw ya hands high for me

[Kardinal]
Yaow!
I'm gonna speak slow so you can hear every word out my mouth
Trust me 'stead of broken chains, the universe everything counts
My tongue speaks for a generation, no ain't concerned with amounts
I now have influence in places I couldn't pronounce
You're ashamed to cosign ya name to the game that you talking MIND THAT CONVO
(GEAH!!) Keeping it real might mean that you keeping it quiet
Intelligent riot (SHHHHH!)
You ready to die but I ain't lettin you die yet
Live through me fly on autopilot
Watch how I speak live while I'm silent
BIG UP THE ISLANDS!!!

Lemme see ya lighter! - Put it in the sky for me
Lemme see ya lighter! - Throw ya hands high for me
Lemme see ya lighter! - Put it in the sky for me
Lemme see ya lighter! - Throw ya hands hiiiiiiiigh
Lemme see ya lighter! - Put it in the sky for me
Lemme see ya lighter! - Throw ya hands high for me
Lemme see ya lighter! - Put it in the sky for me
Lemme see ya lighter! - Throw ya hands hiiiiiiiigh

Lemme see ya...  Lighta! (lighter..lighter..lighter..)
Lemme see ya...  Lighta! (lighter..lighter..lighter..)
Lemme see ya...  Lighta! (lighter..lighter..lighter..)
LEMME SEE YA!... LIGHTA!! (lighter..lighter..lighter..)
