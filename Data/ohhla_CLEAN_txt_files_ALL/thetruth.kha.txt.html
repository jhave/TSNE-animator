[Intro]
*Gunshot*
'Queensbridge and we don't play' ..
'For every rhyme I write, it's 2-5 to life'
'Queensbridge and we don't play'
'Tragedy's the name, figured I'd just remind y'all'
'Queensbridge and we don't play' ..
'For every rhyme I write, it's 2-5 to life'
'Queensbridge and we don't play'
'My, my poetry's deep'

[Chorus 2x]
We are the Truth
We need no proof
Blowin' shots off roof
(Castro: Touch y'all, please don't make us buck y'all)

[Verse 1: Christ Castro]
Yo, the name's Castro, I'm out for pesos
Fuck sitting on my ass like you couch potatos
While you watch wrestlin', smellin what the rock is cookin
I'm in the crackhouse and rock is cookin
Been, locked in macks, with lots of bookings
Beat a nigga down, fuck if them cops is lookin!
Put that heater down son, cuz if you had to pop you wouldn't
You would show up every shortcake topped with pudding
Soft ass nigga, sweet ass nigga
I'ma torch that nigga, peep that nigga
R.I.P. that nigga, ????
See, I'm that nigga, my four fingers on that trigger
Beef me, you better pawn that vigor and buy some guns
'fore they find your lungs on your doormat nigga
Cuz I pack price that'll flush all your organs out
Make yo fam cut the price in your coffin out
Blood drip when the force come out
Slugs rip thru a nigga face blowin large portion out
Talkin bout, you mu'fuckers swear you live, through homicide
come and talk you out
Now you see what you get when your ass get carried away?
Now your ass gettin' carried away

[Chorus 2x]
We are the Truth
We need no proof
Blowin' shots off roof
(Castro: Touch y'all, please don't make us buck y'all)

[Verse 2: Tragedy Khadafi]
Truth is truth, real is real, love is love
Kastro, Khadafi, Blood is Blood
We can go shot for shot, slug for slug
Hit you up, body bags zip you up
I am truly amazing, you cowards ain't phasing me
Mahdi, 2-5, the O-G
I cock back, and pop them thangs
You runnin off octane, you dont wanna lock with the God
Glocks'll bang
Overall, feelin my aura, feelin my style, who you think started this thug shit?
But meanwhile, ask Noreag and 'pone, who kept em in the zone
41st Side, Q.B
Bringin it home, homie we got that
Don't ever try to stop my grind, cuz in the meantime in between tyin my nine
Steady long, steady strong when you fuckin' with mine
And I'ma ?eep? regardless to the charges I'm a G
Discreetly, holdin my heat, 22's on my feet
Ask Havoc ask Nas, from Q.B. to South Prob y'all wanna fuck with the God

[Chorus 2x]
We are the Truth
We need no proof
Blowin' shots off roof
(Castro: Touch y'all, please don't make us buck y'all)

'For every rhyme I write, it's 2-5 to life'
