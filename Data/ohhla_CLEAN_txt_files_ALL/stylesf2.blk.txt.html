[Styles P]
Yeah, whattup three times?
_Time is Money_ niggaz
Truly believe that

Play your feet, no sleep lil' nigga don't lie down
It's real when the beef don't die down
Me I gotta eat, I keep the heat, so picture me high clown
I don't give a fuck, ride later or ride now - keep it on the waist
Let a nigga jump, I'll have him leakin from the face
and put a beatin on the case
Niggaz in the hood might hate me
But they don't try shit cause them 38's ain't got no safeties
S dot, P dot, D-Block
Dolo at the juice bar, weed spot, came with the heat cocked
Seat low, black Crown Vic', let the beat knock
Deep thoughts, ride through New York, who got the streets locked
You can tell your man I'll smoke ya
Rap's Alejandro Sosa, hang you from the helicopter
Hoppin in the Yukon with the tanned out sofas
I only eat seafood
And when I look at these rappers I see seafood
I heard y'all don't give a fuck niggaz, me too
We can meet up the bill, matter fact we can meet up to kill
And to niggaz from crosstown we can meet up the hill
Second album is comin I'm expectin the hate
But I'm the same S.P. so the weapons is placed
And I don't press charges
I'm the type of nigga that'll hop out the garbage
Dressed in camouflage like I came out the forest
Four in the Taurus
Cause everybody singin like the court need a chorus
I'm tired of the games, blowin niggaz brains out the frame
Point blank put it short get a florist, what?</pre>
