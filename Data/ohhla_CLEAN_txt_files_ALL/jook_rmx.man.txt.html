[Intro: Twista] + (Elephant Man)
It's the Elephant Man (That's true) and the Twista with another hit song
And my dogs Youngbloodz, let's show 'em how we get it crunk up in the club
(Oonu wine up)

[Chorus: Elephant Man]
Shake that booty, turn it around
Back that ass up, wine go down
Shake that booty, turn it around
Back that ass up, wine go down

[Verse 1: Elephant Man]
Yuh up inna di club and di music sweet
Yuh fi jook gal (Jook gal jook gal jook gal)
Hand pon di wall, look inna di mirror
And jook gal (Jook gal jook gal jook gal)
Hand pon di ground bumpa inna di air
And jook gal (Jook gal jook gal jook gal)
Junk in di trunk, wine up yuh rump
And jook gal (Jook gal jook gal jook gal)
Shake that ass (Wine wine) y'all lookin fine (Wine wine)
One ting deh pon yuh mind (Wine wine) bend over and wine (Wine wine)
Di Jamaican girls (Wine wine) di New York girls (Wine wine)
Mi see di down south girls dem a (Wine wine)
Dem a wine wine dem a wine wine

[Verse 2: J-Bo]
Now turn around and jook and drop low to the flo'
And swing it back and like that there ya go
Pop the bottle get loose for ya folk
And roll them hips to the left and once mo'
Now shake it up and bend over spread wide
We back again and I'm a whole new ride
With Elephant Man, Twista, Youngbloodz
We off in this beeotch in the middle of the club
So bring it here a lil' mama fall in
And tell your crew that they can join in
So DJ spin it back I gotta tinkle
So best be runnin when you hear that whistle

[Verse 3: Twista]
Now come in shorty won't you show me that love
Back it up on the Twista when I come up in the club
Look at lil' sista when she twirkin that thang
Make me wanna let her hop in my '04 range
Now jook it on me while I throw my bow
Sippin Hypnotic while you drop it down low
I be that nigga rockin Roc-A-Fella crew
Hop out before me let me see what that do
Come here lil' mama you thick it's ridiculous
Look at your body I like how you shake it twirkin titties and thighs
Your body's elegant other shit is irrelevant
It's the Elephant, Youngbloodz, and Twista from the city of Chi
You jook your body like you come from Jamaica
Boo in my pocket I give you every bloodclaat thing
Look how she jookin thast booty she like a wing and winding
So when you hear the cut drop sing

[Bridge: Elephant Man]
Yuh up inna di club and di music sweet
Yuh fi jook gal (Jook gal jook gal jook gal)
Hand pon di wall, look inna di mirror
And jook gal (Jook gal jook gal jook gal)
Hand pon di ground bumpa inna di air
And jook gal (Jook gal jook gal jook gal)
Junk in di trunk, wine up yuh rump
And jook gal (Jook gal jook gal jook gal)

[Verse 4: Sean Paul] (From Youngbloodz, not the reggae artist)
A Sean Paul from the home of the strip clubs
I don't trip I tip show the girl love
I know you know the face I'm a Youngblood
But don't talk just jook girl take it thurr
She said she love my song wanna cut or what
I told her show me your thong 'fore another does
I came for some action I don't wanna hug
If it ain't happenin hit another club
Drank some cold cup of One's Eye
Make me show you some to the bank what not
But I'm straight shorty I ain't fibbin what not
Make her jook from the night to the sun now

[Verse 4: Kiprich]
(Put yuh hands on di floor!!!)
Cock up yuh bumpa a likkle more
Cock it up mek mi slam it like a door
(Put yuh hands on di floor!!!)
Yuh hear mi love it when mi talk to her
Split and spread out like manure
(Put yuh hands on di floor!!!)
Every man love see girl gallore
Shabba seh him waan more pon more
(Put yuh hands on di floor!!!)
True yuh goody goody get a encore
Every girl fi brukout like a sore

[Chorus: Elephant Man]
Shake that booty, turn it around
Back that ass up, wine go down
Shake that booty, turn it around
Back that ass up, wine go down

[Verse 5: Elephant Man]
Love see girls a wine love see girls a shake dem behind
Search di dancefloor till mi find weh mi flip di coin

Hold up let's go back in time memba Jeanie wine
Memba Jeanie when yuh see mi gimme grind
Now a dancehall queenie queenie time
Jump between di lines stoosh girls stop stoosh dem a wine
Every girl waan dem career shine

Come on girl mek mi see booty bounce

[Chorus: Elephant Man]
Shake that booty, turn it around
Back that ass up, wine go down
Shake that booty, turn it around
Back that ass up, wine go down
