[Swizz Beatz over an interpolation of EPMD's "Rampage"]
Record mode! (Record mode!)
Get your money in the air like this (yeah yeah)
FAB TIME~! BK

[Fabolous]
We knock this out homey (yesss)
Street da-da-da-da-damn (yesss)
Ay it's a new year, and I'm back for new money
Just I think I left somethin (JUST BLAZE!)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M.
It's a new year, dolla dolla bill y'all, yup!
Get that money yup! Dolla dolla bill y'all, yup!
Get that money yup! Dolla dolla bill, yup yup!

[Fabolous]
Yesss - it's the return of the young hustle
A nigga came for the money, not the tongue tussle
Me I'd rather do my lip lashin, when the chips cash in
Then you might see me on the strip flashin
like Vegas lights, and they say I shine Vegas bright
Draw a crowd like a Vegas fight
So shiiiiiiit, gettin hit in my leg is like
I mean it coulda been a 2Pac vegas night
Or maybe a Notorious L.A. evening
"Baby you okay?" I mean well I'm breathin
Hell I'm even, bossin and I left
The money ain't right then I toss you to the left
Yesss, to the left, to the left
Everything is hustle to the death for the F-
-A-B baby, they be lazy
Gucci straightjacket cause I may be crazy
Loony for the loot, psycho for the paper
This a new year but I recycle for the paper
If green talks, then I'm the Geico with the paper
So have my check right, no typos with the paper please

[Chorus] - repeat 2X w/ ad libs, end first time end with "I said"

[Fabolous]
They say the rap game remind 'em of the crack game
That's why they money go, quicker than a crack high
My money stack high, how high? Shaq high
Yao high, that's why, yours is Bow Wow high
You lookin at your new hustle, like your last hustle
Was looked at as Russell, in my past hustle
Shorty work it, she be on her ass hustle
She make it clap, she know how to work them ass muscles
Fast rush you, then back to the money
They say I'm frontin, can't turn my back to the money
And truthfully you're cool but I'm attracted to money
So why don'tcha turn your back to the money and let it shake
I'm lovin how you move that smooth, you let it snake
But players don't chase at it baby we let it make
Bet it make sense when you make them dollars
I ain't gotta make them move, but I make them holla
This my year, but y'all can help me celebrate
I'm 9:15, that means I'm hella straight
Swizz stacks, Just Blaze bucks
I'm back for my money, it's just they luck

[Chorus] - repeat 2X w/ ad libs, end first time end with "I said"

[Swizz Beatz]
Get your money in the air, m-m-money in the air {*2X*}
Let me see it up, let, let me see it up {*2X*}
LADIES~! Money in the air, m-m-money in the URR-URR {*2X*}
Money in the air, money in the air
Let me see it up, nigga you don't need that dough
Nigga you don't need that dough...</pre>
