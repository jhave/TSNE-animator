[ INTRO: Richie Rich ]
Haha
Check this out
1993 we gon' move this one time
This about stayin fitted, you know what I'm sayin
Keepin you somethin nice on your back
Whether it be slacks, jeans, khakis, whatever you like to wear
You know what I'm sayin
Tennis shoes, boots, it's all a kit
A k-i-t, ya understand what I'm sayin?
Let let me run it to you like this

[ VERSE 1: Richie Rich ]
I keep a kit, boy, for every single event
And if I had an account of all the money I spent
On this fit, that fit, shoes and hats
I'd probably have receipts in big fat stacks
But I don't sweat that, though, because I'm able to slip
To the mall at any time to flip a new outfit
Get Cross Colors, Kani or maybe a Polo
And now for '93 Richie Rich is goin solo

[ CHORUS ]
Don't be trippin off me, baby, that's the way I be
Haha, it's just a k-i-t
I keeps a kit
(Don't be trippin off me, brother, that's the way I be
It's just a k-i-t, whoaaa)
Don't be trippin off me, brother, that's the way I be
It ain't the k-i-t, fool
Ha, I keeps a kit
(Don't be trippin off me, brother, that's the way I be
It's just a k-i-t, whoaaa)

[ VERSE 2: Richie Rich ]
I can't lounge, I came to snatch
Them '93 Jordans and a college cap
With no mo' suggestions from moms and pops
About pants I don't like and frontstreet tops
The reason I say 'frontstreet', cause you get get fronted
For workin that fit when you know you didn't want it
Them other-day clothes, that I ain't with
That's the main reason I keep a kit
Cause now it's somethin about when I'm out with my crew
And from top to bottom everythang is brand new
And this is my thang, it ain't O.P.P.
And when it comes to my draws I'm down with BBD
I like Nikes, all kinds, and baggy jeans
Oversized shirts and a proper diamond earring
A baseball cap if the team is tight
I thought you knew that I do that when my fade ain't right

[ CHORUS (2X) ]
Don't be trippin off me, baby, that's the way I be
Haha, it's just a k-i-t
I keeps a kit
(Don't be trippin off me, brother, that's the way I be
It's just a k-i-t, whoaaa)
Don't be trippin off me, brother, that's the way I be
It ain't the k-i-t, fool
Ha, I keeps a kit
(Don't be trippin off me, brother, that's the way I be
It's just a k-i-t, whoaaa)

[ VERSE 3: Richie Rich ]
I bet you didn't know that I was mental too, workin ties with my caps
Rich was kickin truth, it ain't no lies in these raps
I'm shoppin at Macy's and the GAP if they don't give me no slack
I'm hittin Emporium and then the ( ? )
And then it's off to that Foot Locker to break em offa somethin proper
I hit this versatile if I got to
With ( ? ) and Jordans and shit
And fresh socks, ones I had stuckin the box
I'm not a thief but I'm quick when I'm shoppin the shit
Spendin twomp for twomp and hittin lick for lick
I got to do that, my money didn't grow on a tree
I had to hustle for mines, it didn't come for free
Ask any baller who takes the chances I take
When your life is at stake it ain't nothin fake
So live a little and spend a grip if you got to, slick
But be down with Richie Rich, fool, and keep a kit

You understand what I'm sayin?
It's all about havin a kit for the 1993, you know what I'm sayin?
Dubble-R one mo' time 
sideways laid back on a 2-Tuff-E-Nuff production type of groove, you know
Somethin smooth
Tommy and Denny, good and plenty, huh

(Don't be trippin off me, brother, that's the way I be
It's just a k-i-t, whoaaa)
Don't be trippin off me, baby, that's the way I be
Haha, it's just a k-i-t
I keeps a kit
(Don't be trippin off me, brother, that's the way I be
It's just a k-i-t, whoaaa)
Don't be trippin off me, brother, that's the way I be
It ain't the k-i-t, fool
Ha, I keeps a kit
(Don't be trippin off me, brother, that's the way I be
It's just a k-i-t, whoaaa)

(Don't be trippin off me, brother, that's the way I be
It's just a k-i-t, whoaaa)

(Don't be trippin off me, brother, that's the way I be
It's just a k-i-t, whoaaa)
