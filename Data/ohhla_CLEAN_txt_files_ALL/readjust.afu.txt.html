[Man's voice]
The end...justifies the means
Two-two-two wrongs...make, a right
I-I should come first, in this nation

[Q]
You gotta readjust the means
I'll tell you what I mean
Sometimes you gotta work it out
Sometimes you gotta figure it out

You gotta readjust the means
I'll tell you what I mean
Sometimes you gotta work it out
Sometimes you gotta figure it out
Yeah, yeah...yeah

[Afu-Ra]
I have so many questions, guessin' what life's about
Usin' seven of my nine lives, figurin' out
I'm goin' through it day to day
Or should I say: maze to maze?
I know that jewels light the way, listen
There's too many shades of grey, tryin' to stay, right
Peripheral vision, is seekin' out my sunlight
I know that love is love, and hate is hate
Twenty-seven years of tribulation marking my case
Yeah, I guess I'm stressing my case
There's only one thing I'm promised in life
That's my fate
Born to set the pace while I'm racin' the race
I know it's hard work, that's why I'm holdin' the ace
As I look to jump, up on that righteous path
I got angels on one shoulder, demons on the other half
A mirror face to face, surveying my landscape
All the while I be singing this space

[Q]
You gotta readjust the means
I'll tell you what I mean
Sometimes you gotta work it out
Sometimes you gotta figure it out

You gotta readjust the means
I'll tell you what I mean
Sometimes you gotta work it out
Sometimes you gotta figure it out
Yeah, yeah...yeah

[Afu-Ra]
As we haze through the haze of enslavement
While the sweat's beatin millions of feet pound on the pavement
I know it's nine to five, or five to nine
Forget about the thoughts that I'm wastin' my time
Just use the tutelage, of your legendary fore-fathers
Cos right now, we now the struggle is ours
It's not too complicated, just combinations of pulling our resources
Of our sisters and our brothers
Who be a alike, that's a little insight
The strength be coming in numbers it's like dynamite
No riddle right, spit it right, about some real life
And are we really rich, at peace and settled?
When everyday homeless people peddle for nickels
While Easy Mo Bee strikin' a chord
Of this hip-hop oracle, desires for life
And what? You know what I'm coming to
It's just my point of view

[Q]
You gotta readjust the means
I'll tell you what I mean
Sometimes you gotta work it out
Sometimes you gotta figure it out

You gotta readjust the means
I'll tell you what I mean
Sometimes you gotta work it out
Sometimes you gotta figure it out
Yeah, yeah...yeah yeah yeah (reverbs)

[Afu-Ra]
And as we realise life, and what?
We gotta suck it in
And are we droppin' some knowledge, or are we frontin' an'?
Your course in life, no matter how you rub it in
There's so many roads, either you strugglin' or bubblin'

[Q]
You gotta readjust the means
I'll tell you what I mean
Sometimes you gotta work it out
Sometimes you gotta figure it out

You gotta readjust the means
I'll tell you what I mean
Sometimes you gotta work it out
Sometimes you gotta figure it out

You gotta readjust the means
I'll tell you what I mean
Sometimes you gotta work it out
Sometimes you gotta figure it out

You gotta readjust the means
Tell me what I mean
Sometimes you gotta work it out
Sometimes you gotta figure it out
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh oh</pre>
