Like you need to be loved
And I, hold you like you need to be hugged
And I'm, never letting you go 'cuz TRUST
You all I need in my life I ain't letting you go 'cuz I (love you)
And I'm letting it show for now ease your mind 'cuz in time we grow
Listen, if we right for one another we live
You wife unlike them other ones I've been with 'cuz I (I want to love you)
Anyway I can, show you it's not the scene everyday I can

And I, give you things that one can only dream of
(Love you) from the bottom of my heart

[Verse 2 (w/ Donell Jones in background)]
Every minute every hour
Of any day any place that you desire

Smoke out while we chill in the grill 'cuz I (love you)
For the fact I'm grown, I'm 24 need something I could come home to
Something to hold on to, for the rest of my life
And I can show you what it's like to be in Trini for a night 'cuz (I want to love you)
It's been a long way here, from plan to hallway
To bring us all way here
To the sweets in L.A. or beach M-i-a or chill out pool
Shout out to crib where I lay 'cuz I (love you)
And everyday that pass we gotta live it to it's limit like we live in our last
And we been broke before
It's from the bottom to the top
Wit' this love I never felt before now why

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Donell Jones]
Now I got a love that'll set you free
This is where you oughta be, yeah
Lady clap your hands with me, huh
It's Donell Jones and Memphis Bleek, yeah
So tell your friends you're going out
You know what this is about
So lady come and ride with me

[Chorus: 2x]</pre>
