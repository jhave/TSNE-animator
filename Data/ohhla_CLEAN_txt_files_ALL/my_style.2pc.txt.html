[Intro]
[Tupac] Old jealous ass motherfuckers
[Greg ] Yo Pac, baby what's up?
[Tupac] They'd love to see me in my motherfucking casket
[Tupac] What's up my nigga? Greg motherfucking Nice
[Greg ] It ain't happening
[Tupac] That new? Yeah
[Greg ] That's one of them new Ben Franklin's, you're counting there baby Pac?
[Tupac] We gotta get our cash man, to do it
[Greg ] We gotta get that money, homeboy
[Tupac] We got the West Sside and the East Side
[Greg ] Oh man, this is how we do it, 
        East West, west east to south, that's how do it
[Tupac] They can feel it, We're the fucking realest, let's do it
[Greg ] Ahhhh

[Chorus: Tupac] X2
How we; Our own styles
How we; Our own styles
How we; Our own styles
Our own styles

[Verse One: Tupac]
Don't you love it? - Tupac free shit, that reach the public
Still I believe my speech so deep that all my real niggaz dub it
Ass naked rhymes in these cash making times
Got me losing my mind inside the lines of these wicked rhymes
Label me a ghetto star, coming up quick
Shit! Fuck what you heard, we be running this shit
It's plain to see, my whole damn clique shine bright
Always knew the real niggaz would end the shit when the time is right
Now East to West, it's irrelevant, we're doing it world wide
Ha ha, similar to bitches, like girls they hide
They die slow, when I ride low, bumping this beat
I bury all bitch made niggaz; coming for me
I rock them to sleep, then evade the cops
Ha ha ha ha, I'll never go alive, 45 Blazing shots
Still getting mine, living blind, search for salvation
Still got my guns, but I visualize One Nation
My work is done when my niggaz get their cash in stacks
Get your ass on the cash chase, mash in packs
Ha ha, forever balling, the alcohol calling me
And I still, bust on them all til they crawl to me
To all my Hip-Hop junkies and my niggaz in jail
When this song play give them hell
My thug nation

[Hook: Greg Nice]
HUH! HUH! HUH! HUH! HUH!
Peep out how we freak our own styles
Peep out how we freak our own styles
Peep out how we freak our own styles
Peep out how we freak our own styles
Peep out how we freak our own styles HUH!
Peep out how we freak our own styles HUH!
Peep out how we freak our own styles
Peep out how we freak our own styles Yeah
Peep out how we freak our own styles

[Verse Two: EDI Amin]
Enter; make yourself welcome! cause EDI is hosting
Rolling with niggaz on the mash, coast to coasting
We don't be boasting (Nah!) no high posting is allowed
Makaveli hit us a lick and we set to make it for twenty years
But it's all gravy, baby who does this daily?
It ain't amazing, real niggaz trail blazing
Man, stays in constant flow cause we got's to get it y'all
Always had a passion for cash so now it's getting critical
Digital, display relays that on this day
The East Coast/West Coast war is now history
Feel me? then picture me rolling
With niggaz from Hoboken to Oakland
Putting it down more potent than that shit you're smoking
One Nation!

[Verse Three: Young Noble]
Young Noble, I'm calm and casual
Bomb like the Arabs do, the end be tragical
Televised, I'm nasty new, the revolution coming
What you gon be shooting or running?
My crew was trained for gunning
Soldier state your name and number
We're racing Hummers, trying to catch the sunset
We lace state runners, a hand full of death threats
So what's next? - a war plan and a strategy
Battle me to the death, there's none left to hell with casualties
We made niggaz under training, trained triggers for the aiming
Jersey claiming; ain't a damn thing changing
One Nation!

[Hook: Greg Nice]

OoohhaaaahhhHH said what? - said what?

[Verse Four: Greg Nice]
I been rocking mic's since Sergio Valenti
Down for my people just like Kunta Kinte
Got more Boricua mommies than Tito Peuente
My man Tupac picked me up in the Bentley
You come from the East, come to speak peace
Come from the West, bring the Buddha bless
Come from the East, come to speak peace
Come from the West, bring the Buddha bless
But ain't no motherfucking hair off my chest
Time is hard, I rock a bullet proof vest
Met so many yes men, so many yes
They tried to gas, my head like Hess
The heavenly father, put me to the test
Divide and conquer, what I do best
Ain't nothing to it, but alleviate stress

[Hook: Greg Nice]

[Outro: Tupac]
Ha ha ha ha shit, was it ever a war?
[Greg] Oh! man yo Pac, this is all lovely baby
Only in your minds (Yeah nigga) 
Today we sign the treaty (East Side/West side)
All the real niggaz ride, to pay these motherfuckers (We're riding nigga)
Nobody trying to be clashing and shit (World Wide)
Motherfuckers trying to get their cash 
That's why we mash in this bitch (Greg Nice, Tupac and Tha Outlawz)
So I'ma just ride out on this motherfucker (Smith N Wesson)
Let my Oakland peeps let you bitch made niggaz know how we roll
(Baby Jesus and them all stars, you know how we doing it, BIOTCH!!)</pre>
