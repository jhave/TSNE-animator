(Pusha T Talking)
No no no.....
I told you.... I live this shit (echoing)
I aint just up here, rappin and tappin, spittin and skittin and shit
Naw, uh uhh, not me
I'm not you, I'm not you rapper, I'm not you.... Pusha

[Pusha T]
I keep that ziploc bustin at the stitches
Culinary chemist, I serve the malicious, to break the fiends fixes
One give you the sniffles, the other, leave you with the itches
Transport airport with the vaseline, so I can,
Fulfill my dreams of passion and green, more cash then ya seen
Within Ashton its green, me drivin up fast with the lean
Zonin family, keep youngins in them rented Camrys
Door panels full of shit and I aint full of shit
Wreckless ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, its four pounds of slab
Nah bitch we don't believe in air bags
Cars turn tricks like them Ringling brother skits
Whether bitch hop out, or the glock pop out, ya know what I'm about
Blow to ya sinus til the snot drop out

(Jadakiss overlapping Pusha T's last line)
Whoever said birds fly south for the winters a damn lie
Got em right here, and if I don't like you the grams high
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend taste it they need it
They could smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it
Prolly think I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take alotta shots, A.I style
Jada, the name is filthy, but so what, the motherfuckin game is filthy
You know what, my mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega, and the Cane the built me so I
Could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker
When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin you love, ya own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows, or dreads, I will eliminate

[Roscoe P. Coldchain]

I'm far from a noodle nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sex
Nigga that's funny you say you a killa how?
What is it the return of the killer clown?
You don't put no fear in my heart
I make ya people say wow that didn't look like my man
They flipped upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit wit ten rounds, at pointblank, and pointblank
Coldchian left that nigga stankin
Half static and face I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and, I didn't give em a chance to blink when,
I dodged up on em, pressed the forty up on him shocked em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby I rocked em
The Coffin the cradle, you cant bite the hand that made you,
That's the beginning of the end, and you a thug that pretends
Carl Coldchain, suit the nigga, I got a great vision I see through men
And squeeze triggers wit bullets that go through men

[Styles P]
Fuck wit S.P that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll grape ya chest, no sleep like I hate the rest
I'm in the hood like its my fate to rep
I hold it down, any place I step
And I love gettin slept on
Cuz I'm rawer than dope fresh outta Africa that never been stepped on
Dog, Ima clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday the ghost the main reason why ya set gone
Why I love riffin the war you wouldn't understand
Cuz my God is different than yours
If the world spin in a circle I wanted men to move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for, creepin through the hood and
Shit aint really good, but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a bull
Want ya insides out so I mean it when I pull

[Malice]
Rappers is talking to me as if (come on)
We in the same boat I tell them quick no I move Coke! (uh uhh)
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't recieve you with open arms (No)
It shames me to no end,
To feed poison to those who could very well be my kin (uh huh)
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs at the same time cry
Yes it pains me to see them needness
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the street
I see no pity for they fix when they kids couldn't eat (so sorry)
And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know, that I aint shit (I aint shit)
My heart bleed but that's aside from the fact
I live from my kids and theirs and them youngins after that</pre>
