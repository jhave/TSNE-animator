[El Da Sensai]
In the rhyme we trust, bust lyrical action
Ripping like traction, addition subtractin'
Acts who rap through, another man vision
The lively, MC, on your television
With the true art smart, of start fool harty party
Hardy smarties, who can't shine against deez, degrees
Bust kids across the mouth
With the style that I'm about, funny talk like down south
(For real) Relentless, with a twist, divine and on time
And off beat, with a pocket full of ?tee climb?
Boundaries, rivalries and such, popping three in the clutch
Get tightrops like double dutch, much
And anticipated, T plus T equals the minerals
Prolong the sequal for your review
See through, all those who play like glass
Get my ass on route and take the transit that's max

	If you don't know who's in this end
	Nigga you'd better think twice about the Brick City Kids
	Puff mad iz, fuck who you are
	Bringing down fools is all our troopers are   (Repeat 2x)

[Tame One]
I'm all about the weed vapors and papers
1-800 pagers and the stages
Hit live spots before the rap pages
All of us say this is worth the top dollar
So I hollar, using MC's as Rhodes Scholars
I don't bother playing Godfather
I'd rather just jam like Bambaataa, give me room like the Ramada
I gotta go for broke, no jokes, I get open off that weed smoke
Making God nod like I'm ?P-Dope?
We wrote, half my wild book and shook crooks
Now my pager's got more flavors inside of it than a cookbook
Look, I can't get took, like some book of rotten Brooklyn
I go do paperwork like Central Booking
You get your title tooken, fucking with this nigga who be bugging
Showing lovin' like I was your cousin
Super party buzzing like a contact
Rhyme's fat, dimes ask, "Where that notty-headed nigga fine ass?"
With the wine glass making time pass fast
Muffle on hash out the stash
Boom Squad forever, non-believers won't last
Stepping on your ass get your style before it's smashed
Running through the "one two's" bringing down the three the hard way
Day to day, distinguishing my work from just play play
Vibing all day, then relating the information into concepts
Taking small steps to build projects
High tech like internet web sites
Uploading megabytes every time I touch the mic

	If you don't know who's in this end
	Nigga you'd better think twice about the Brick City Kids
	Puff mad iz, fuck who you are
	Bringing down fools is all our troopers are   (Repeat 2x)</pre>
