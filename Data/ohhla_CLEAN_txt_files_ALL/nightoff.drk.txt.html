[Drake]
Spending every moment in the studio
I'd never said it'd be fair
But when you're all alone I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there

[Chorus]
Come right here
Set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do

No you ain't explainin how you want it done
Just be quiet I'll do fine without your help girl
Can you work without a second for some fun
Now you finally got a moment to yourself girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it

"oh oh" [ad-libs]

[Lloyd]
I been waitin for so long to get you all alone
Now I finally got you right here
So baby I'm a lock my door and disconnect my phone
Cause I wanna make one thing clear
I want you on top
So let your hair down
I took the night off for you
Girl I'm gonna turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what we're about to do

"oh oh" [ad-libs]

[Chorus]
Come right here
Set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do

"oh oh" [ad-libs]

No you ain't explainin how you want it done
Just be quiet I'll do fine without your help girl
Can you work without a second for some fun
Now you finally got a moment to yourself girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it

[Lloyd]
Oh oh. It's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio</pre>
