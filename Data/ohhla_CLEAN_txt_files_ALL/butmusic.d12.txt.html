It's shit like this I kick to these rich white kids
Who just might see how fucked up this sick life is
Whoops I did it again didn't I my shit's harder
to figure out than what Britney's tit size is (oooh)
I probably pissed you off again didn't I bitch (so what?)
You and Christina Gaguilera kiss my grits {*smak*}
You know how many shits I give? I wish I did
So I can quit givin these twisted little kids ideas
This just in, Britney just dissed Justin
She just fucked Ben, got tit fucked and dick sucked him
If Affleck can get his ass licked, how come I can't, shit?
God damn bitch, I'm rich, I can't understand this
Are those pictures I made of us together on the internet
as close as I'm ever gonna get to hittin it from the back?
And shit, when it comes to that, I hit harder from the back
than Everlast, when he's pluggin Lethal in his fuckin ass
Just give me one more chance, Britney hit me one more time
Let me know what's on your mind, Whitney give me one more line
to sniff, you fuckers know what time it is
Fuck your jewelery my record's almost diamond, BEEOTCH!

[HOOK 2X: Eminem + Dr Dre]
What's goin on in the world today
People fightin, feudin, lootin, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre (it ain't nuttin but music)

[Bizarre]
Eminem doesn't like N'Sync, well I do
So fuck him, and the Backstreet Boys too
Whatever happened to the cast of Different Strokes
Gary's broke, Todd's snortin coke, and Dana overdosed
(Awww) I got two little boys with me
Michael Jackson sent two helicopters to get me (hee-heee!)
I'm up early wit my hair curly
Me and Mr. Furly, fuckin Laverne and Shirley!

[Kuniva]
A lot of rappers are livin in la la land
That's why I let my dogs out on the Baha Men
As bad as a life I had, I'm not mad
I don't need to be a jackass to beat up my dad
My whole family's country, my grandmother's old fashioned
And she keeps askin me why I rap wit a honky
But grannie I'm a flunky I could be a junkie
I could be hangin with the hoochies out at the club scene

[Kon Artis]
So all the independent women in the house! [HOUSE!]
Show us your tits and shut your motherfuckin mouth! [WHAT?!]

[Proof]
Robert Downey, Bobby Brownie
Whitney Houston, the shit's she's usin [SNIFF!]
Jesse Jackson, reverend scandal
Got George Michael's, Tevin Campbell's
PeeWee Herman's, peep show places
Public restrooms? Beat those cases

[HOOK]

[Swifty McVay]
Huh, your mom and dad probably mad at us [for what]
We done turned their kids into little body snatchers
Aint like where I'm from, we don't bite our tongue
Are you sure you want niggaz 21 to carry guns?
It's sad but I'm glad that I'm made to rhyme
Where you work you ain't gettin paid for that overtime
It's only music, media know it but they blind
I aint in y'all light, so stay the hell up outta mine
Y'all the reason why Princess Diana ended up dyin
If you people get offended I don't care (stop cryin!)
Tryin to get us to leave cause what we say just ain't clean (uh uh)
But holdin back on what I say just ain't me

[Kon Artis]
Now what's these parents so mad for? (Your music is bad for 'em!)
For teenage kids that drink more than Ted Danson in Cheers
Carson drink beers, we all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch
(SHUT UP!) Broke or rich, I still do the same old shit
I don't jump in front of a camera and change no shit
So when they ask me about my sarcasticness
I just slap 'em, turn around and ask 'em this
