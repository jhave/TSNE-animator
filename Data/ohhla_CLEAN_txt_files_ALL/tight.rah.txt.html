Yeah, Rah Digga.. Flipmode, Outsidaz
Shit tight, down to the coochie
Yeah, check it

[And I] And I say what's tight 
cause a sista write rhymes all day and all night
Dwellin South of the Hudson, New Jerusalem
in seclusion, using fake pseudonyms [I'm true bad]
Mind travels like a skitzo on two tabs 
with doo rags hangin from my pockets
[Me] Me, the rap bitch that goes back to pediatrics
Early left rappers like you were straight vexin [So]
So recognize, I make a nigga eyes come alive 
off of five two fives; disguise the camouflage
I shoot a virus out of my spirals with mad priors
for takin mad niggaz titles!
Wetter than a resevoir; lurking in the bushes 
striking blows like Chesamar(?) code-name Hasana
Warmer than a bomber, hotter than the region of Ghana
Get loot like that Trump bitch, Ivana

[Chorus]
Now, who be writin rhymes all night
Rah Digga in tha house and plans is tight
[Tight] Peace to the ones that don't bite
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight

A black QUEEN, ya best believe my black jeans won't say Paco
I swing to the Vill' for some waffles and some beef falafel
Rap very tight liquor got me DIFFERENT
Dirtier than an overseas shipment of ki's
I write these TIGHT BUTTAS, creme de la GUTTAS
Call me Sheik Digga
Plotting over loops like the eight figures
Baby I'm hard, represent the feminist God 
[What?] that gets blunted - watch rhymers runneth, over
See me in the camel Range Rover 
[Chop] And I won't stop for Jake 
And keep heat by the waist for those that playa hate
[NOW] Show you the way to blow, better than I tell you
Word to my beeper and my cellu-lar [What?] Polo curls
Diggin all the rapper's shit like they go-go girls

[Chorus]

WHO THE TIGHTEST?  I rock with laryngitis
Gold's good for Midas, but I want the highest
So don't try me cause I be the bitch [I swear]
I'll leave you twisted like a thug with blonde hair
[Yeah] I blow up the spot like Dennis Scott
Go forward, your chance of defeatin me is morbid
Cuz I get you open like the comin of the Pope 
when I group shit tighter than a 3 piece suit
[Peace, peace] Peace to niggaz I rhyme wit
My Outsidaz correspondents be more fluid than embalmin
[We pros] I decompose, any rapper to the bone
Down to they X and Y chromosome
So SEE MY NAME tagged in bold or italics [Bow, bitch]
Cuz I'll be the only one salvaged
Number one imported like Beck's
Tighter than three or more heads in a CRX

[Chorus 2X]

Tight, tight, aight?
And the plans is tight
Tight, tight.. TIGHT!
Tight, tight aight?
And the plans is tight
Tight..
[Busta] One, two, three, BO!</pre>
