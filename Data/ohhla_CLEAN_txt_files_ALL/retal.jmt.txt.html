[Jus Allah]
The metal inside the barrel passes
Through the frames in ya glasses
Quick passage
Leave your dome piece backless
Envision blackness
Leave you hatless
Fucking capless
Watchin Niggas dig the spot where the Earth's crack is
Hard to graph like science and math is
The cavemen who dont practice and live backwards
We oxin'
With streets is watchin
Release shotguns 
Niggas got Dietz and Watson
Feel no love
No way you shield the slugs
The ill thugs
We box with steel gloves
Doubt my faith
you can taste the slug case
Leaving niggas looking like dogs with the pug face
Even your girl can catch the capsule
I love pussy
But never the bitch that its attached to
  
Why you wanna battle wit kids with steel tongues?
Who rip up mics and drink "puerto-rock(rican)" rum
85 (the 85%): face the truth, your too dumb
If retaliation comes yo then fuck it it just comes 
  
(repeat)
 
[Ikon]
We itchin' to kill
Thats why we spittin' the real
Stick to the drill
And maybe we'll be grippin a mill'
The clip'll expel
Dump 'em in a ditch or a hill
'Cuz the muthafucka aint left me shit in his will
And y'all was always soundin' like a bitch when you spill
And we the rawest muhfuckin' clique in the field
So real muthafuckas better recognize real
Or ill muthafuckas gonna exercise skill
Y'all better chill when the Hologram build
Lil muhfuckah got hands is like steel
Whoever approach me and what i feel
"while u find ya legs bein' replaced by steel"
So y'all better yield
Or ima choke faggots
My hands held more razorblades than coke addicts
We like to quote facists
Cuz we the meanest 
And rip off your fingers with the pliers of Chakademus
  
Why you wanna battle wit kids with steel tongues?
Who rip up mics and drink "puerto-rock(rican)" rum
85 (the 85%): face the truth, your too dumb
If retaliation comes yo then fuck it it just comes 
  
(repeat)
  
yo yo yo yo yo yo jedi mind baby
Iledelph stand by, baby, naw I'm sayin? Ikon the Hologram
JusAllah, Jusallah
My man Chico, enemy of mankind......
  
Naw I'm sayin'?</pre>
