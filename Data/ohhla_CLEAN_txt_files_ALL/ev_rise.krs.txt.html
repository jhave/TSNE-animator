[L Da Headtoucha]
Geah, it's Headtoucha and KRS combined and
Yes, through the new millenium era we grindin
Yes, this combination right here's one of a kind and
It's Soul Supreme's dream team, we shinin
Clap, I'm tryin to tell 'em there's more to it than rhymin
It's now or never, all and together we climbin
Clap, let's rewind to the beginnin of time and
Back again, words merge over tracks like um, Shaq goes in
I, crack yo' cabbage in, we ain't no average men
My pen takes people to places they haven't been
Like the streets or the gutter, when I speak over beats
You discover I drop heat, don't compete with this brother
No, just compete with each other, I'm deep in the gutter
This underground sound, and I'm keepin it gutter
Music is - the reason I'm livin, the reason I'm driven
and givin my all to all y'all

[KRS-One]
Forgive me, I always been an indie-pendant
Hip-Hop started on my block, I remember it
It's in me, others wanna spit what's trendy
But I take it back to Mork &amp; Mindy
Tellin these young cats, Nanu Nanu
Keep my name out your mouth, it's too much to swallow
Big up to my people, Peedo and Gato
Victory over the streets, that's our motto
I ain't forget you Choco-latte
Chocolatte, you the original not the co-py
But enough of that, run it back, we lovin that
Break from them other cats, KRS-One is back
Just look where the sun is at, where the moon is at
If you in tune to that, you can never lose in rap
Astronomy, all in inside of me
For that conscious lyric, you know who you got to see!
