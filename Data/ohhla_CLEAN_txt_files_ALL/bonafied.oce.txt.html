[O.C.]
Yo, fuck having my neck dripped, with jewels that don't mean shit
This man behind his rhyme is the nigga that's slick
Licking my thumbs, counting papers from my street-smart wigs
In the club we ?hub rows? taking some flicks
Pushing the same whips niggas got with platinum stacks
Two LP's far from gold, you people think I'm selling crack
Nah, they see me living with a smile on my face
And if you see me in the spot I'm down low in the place
Sipping my liquor, Remi Martin running through my liver
Sucking, all in and feels, the shit tastes bitter
Having fun, for that particular time and date
I feel I'm almost to the point, so I calmly skate
Fuck all the broads, fuck all the cats who appluad my name
Who wouldn't give me no love if I wasn't in the game
I'm full of suprises, analyze the all wise
Ricarders protect my eyes when I'm dipping
On the BQ my Benz see through
Fuck tints, I'm live nigga, and so is my people
Half of me is godly, the other half is evil
So if it comes down to it, I'm strapped and we do it, feel me

[Jay-Z]
Love is life and life is love
Real live niggas and bonafied thugs
Career criminals with ice-grilled mugs
Not afraid to shed blood to bleed, I believe because (Repeat 2x)

[O.C.]
Yo, I try to live my life right, Earth is like the tree of life
Tempted by the forbidden fruit of my face, I want to take a bite of it
It looks sweet, making my mouth water, then I thought
Of a foul thought of filming somebody daughter on camcorder
She of age but her mind's in the cage
Fuck my man and my man and my man, for no wage
Savage cause, Devil's got me locked by the balls
Inside my soul, good and evil fighting a war
Mixed feelings like Remi and cranberry a man
How will he fall if I shoot him dead where he stand?
I'm thinking like Charles Manson, dreaming of Marilyn Manson
Praying over my grave, deep with the klansman
Roots of evil coming in shapes and forms
I cannot identify what's right or what's wrong
All I know is sometimes I fiend for dough, fiend for clothes
And fiend for hoes backstage at my shows, uh

[Jay-Z]
Love is life and life is love
Real live niggas and bonafied thugs
Career criminals with ice-grilled mugs
Not afraid to shed blood to bleed, I believe because (Repeat 2x)

[O.C.]
Yo, life is full of lessons that we all must learn
Take head and pay attention cause of drastic turn
Can be just around the corner, waiting coming dead on
In the pit, so how ya living in the path you're on
It's in the cards being dealt, I want the best for me
It's Love, Hell or Right, O.C. has a destiny
To be the best that I can be, that means giving my all
I'm too intelligent and bright to be taking a fall
I'm 20 some odd years old, young, black, and I'm fars
I'm living to see some grandkids and die of natural cause
Retire somewhere living in the Keys of Fla.
Sipping on Coors, all in happy, spitting tobacco from my jaws
The price of hard living, hard work, granted you're given a chance y'all
Succeed and advance far
Taking advantage, opportunities is right in your face
Avoided unless driven to murder was the case, uh

[Jay-Z]
Love is life and life is love
Real live niggas and bonafied thugs
Career criminals with ice-grilled mugs
Not afraid to shed blood to bleed, I believe because (Repeat 2x)</pre>
