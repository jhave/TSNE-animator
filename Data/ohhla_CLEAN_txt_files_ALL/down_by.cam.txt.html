[talking]
We goin' do this one here, Chatham County style
It's a 9-1-2 thang dawg
Yean know, now ya know, fa'sho (whoa)

[Chorus]
We come from down by the river on twanky twankies
Blowin big ball bats of that danky danky
So Funky (ya smell that)
Ya so country (you know)

[Verse 1]
We drankin (Uh Uh) Big Boi bottles of don Pizzae
Crissay, got me dizzay, Crypay, in my swishae
Sweeter, we the, niggaz who get this bitch jumpin'
Crunk, just like some whonk in yo trunk when its bumpin
I-I-I I need get up wit Red
Big lips, bow-leggeds, wit a helluva helluva head
On her shoulder, I told her mama I'm comin over
So she could ride-n-ride-n-ride me like a Range Rover
She hot like Daytona, nothin but some strings on her
(Look like she need to cool down)
So I put my chain on her
See we dem 20 inch riders, wit tha slim tires
We we come thru niggaz grab they bitches wit some grip pliers
I'm from the city where the grass is green
So you know I'm gettin high, just like the price of gasoline
Man dem boyz from Savannah at the door
Well let 'em in, What the fuck you waitin' fo! (Whoa)

[Chorus x2]
We come from down by the river on twanky twankies
Blowin big ball bats of that danky danky
So Funky (ya smell that)
Ya so country (I know)

[Verse 2]
These niggaz talkin all that shit, so they got stank mouth
Nigga touched my tape, it burnt his hand, but he say it ain't hot
Pinocchio nose, you know I got the sickest flows
When they see my neck and wrists glow they start to hide they hoes
Like Bitch, come on, and bring yo ass home
'Fo you be back in the projects livin wit you grandma, uh uh
You know I puts it down like a shitty baby
I'm like flour, grease, and water, ALL GRAVY!
I'm comin' hard like, dicks in a strip club
Your lyrics need stay-hard and ginseng cuz they won't stand up!
Against these flows I spit, these niggaz know I'm sick
They took a laxative, but still ain't droppin shit
Pain we bringin
I know you see the way the charm and the chain be hangin
Bling-a-lingin and swangin
Lil mama say "Oooh boy them diamonds blindin me! Where U from?"
Down by the river, (Whoa) tweeta-leeta-lee!

[Chorus x2]
We come from down by the river on twanky twankies
Blowin big ball bats of that danky dankies
So Funky (ya smell that)
Ya so country (I know)

[Verse 3]
We come from, down by the water, (WHAT?)
Savannah, Georgia done finally got on da map
(It's bout time they learned how to rap, down there!)
Oh yea, y'all niggaz sleepin on us!
Well wake up, wake up, wake up! Say What?
The house on fire
Get from under the cover, get yo shit, get the fuck out!
YO RENT'S DUE MUTHAFUCKA!
We came to get it buck
(So won't you) TEAR IT DOWN!
If we to drunk to drink we buy it just to pour it out
I'm from the dirty south
Got work when it's a drought
We fuck dem hoes and drop 'em off, they take dem bitches out
While you spittin the game, I'm sendin a dame
To the mall, wit a empty pocketbook to get a few thangs, mane
We poppin bottles, fuckin models, blowin dough like dro
Niggaz thinkin that we hit the Georgia Lotto
20 inches on my auto-MOBILE!
(Ay, where da fuck y'all boyz from, cuz I know y'all ain't from round hea!)

[Chorus]
We come from down by the river on twanky twankies
Blowin big ball bats of that danky dankies
So Funky (ya smell that)
Ya so country (I know)</pre>
