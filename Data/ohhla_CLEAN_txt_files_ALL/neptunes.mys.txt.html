[Verse 1]
When I met you boy you was the sweetest thing
Like a Sade tape in the coldest spring
When I saw your eyes I thought they shined for me
Just being in your space was divine me
Gave you true smiles and a lot more time
Then them ballin cats who fiend to be mine
But really love you wasn't even fuckable
The way you were made you highly untouchable
Peeped you though every move you made
Studied from a distance watched the games you played
And some would say I shoulda never came closer
But I ain't never had the taste for the phrase not supposed ta
So I chose imagine that
Put a plan into play to make it public fact
That I'm the one and you shoulda knew
That them other girls have never loved you like I do

(Chorus)
For you I'd dive into a treacherous sea
Bring you Neptune's jewels to keep you happy
I would fly into a merciless sun steal you the sky
Cuz you're the one

[Verse 2]
Mighta took some time but most good things do
Manifest when the time is true
I admit I was nervous cuz things get changed
Something about my lifestyle makes love so strange
So many angles and tangled components
Everybody wanna touch just for the moment
But you put a new hue in my blue
Added a perspective to my concrete views
'Bout tossin caution into the breeze
Followin' emotion like streams to the seas
Top priority believe you me
Like love how you feel, you alright, whatchu need?
It's more than your lips on the nap of my necks
Or your hands on my breast, with your leg on my thigh
Or the look in your eyes as you slide inside
It's the way you make me wanna live instead of die

(Chorus)

[Verse 3]
The funniest part is that I've never claimed you
Yet and still when I talk to God I name you
Even got you own song look, you a star
No need to call names you know who you are
I'd give you everything be the mother of your seeds
Keep the world at bay if you need time to breath
Be the chest to rest on when things a bit to much
These offers they stand so no need to rush
You young black and gifted whole life aheada you
I love for that would never try to tame you
So I remain dedicated in the wings
Inspired by your laugh to wait for things
I just hope you aware of what you actually got
A true woman make my man want for not
So when you here this song know I'm speakin to you
This is a b-girl ballad, for true

(Chorus) x2</pre>
