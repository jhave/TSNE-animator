[Busta Rhymes speaking]
Yeah
Shorty I know what you need
I got everything you need
I promise I ain't gonna hold out either
I'ma give it all to you baby
It's on, bust it

[Chorus: 1- Busta Rhymes 2- Mariah Carey]

1-  Baby if you give it to me
    I'll give it to you
    I know what you want
    You know I got it
    Baby if you give it to me
    I'll give it to you
    I know what you want
    You know I got it

2-  Baby if you give it to me
    I'll give it to you
    I know what you want
    You know I got it
    Baby if you give it to me
    I'll give it to you
    I know what you want
    You know I got it

[Verse 1: Spliff Star]
We been together for a few years
Shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames
Like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road
I'm hardly ever home
Always busy this busy that
Can't talk on the phone
I know you aggrevated
Walk around frustrated
Ya patience gettin' short
How long can you tolerate it
Listen ma I'm just motivated
I do this for us
Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now

[Verse 2: Baby Sham]
Hey yo to really be honest
You stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't express the words
How much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man never above ya
I can tell that you different from most
Slightly approach you
And that ill shit about it
We gon' sex every day
But when we sex we tease
In a passionate way
I love the way you touch it
Those little elaborate ways
Got the guard feelin' released
To relax for the day
It's on you ma

[Chorus 1- Nusta Rhymes 2- Mariah Carey]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Shh, mami listen
I feel ya love for me baby
And how it move through you
I been longin' for the moment
To talk the truth to you
Listen, I'm never home
I always get up and go
Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigga-ma-ro
I never meant to put a thousand pounds
Of stress on ya head
I love the way we sleep
And always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' ya patience
Sheddin' ya tears with me
I ask you my mami
Please continue to bear with me

[Verse 4: Rah Digga]
We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from Lucy's and buses to fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed
Still got each other back
Word is bond never screw none of these industry cats
We like Scull and Mulder
Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game watchin' our seeds gettin' older

[Chorus 1- Nusta Rhymes 2- Mariah Carey]

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yes you know I'll die for you
And ya know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
And give ya my love and cry with you

[Verser 6: Mariah Carey]
I will climb a mountain high
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me
This is where your love is supposed to be

[Verse 7 : Rampage]
I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA you haven't seen me
Ya lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats ya ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world you never leave me
Fall back ma I'll make ya lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things ya do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter you'll never do me greasy

[Chorus 1- Nusta Rhymes 2- Mariah Carey]
