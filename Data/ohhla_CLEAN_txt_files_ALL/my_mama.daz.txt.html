[Chorus]
My mama tell me all the time I'm a be something
I'm still a nigga till I die, What with heat bustin
They'll never take me alive
I'm a survivor makin'something from nothing
My mama told me I'm a be something (And I believe her)

My mama told me I'm a be something 
I'm still a nigga till I die, What with heat bustin
They'll never take me alive
I'm a survivor makin'nothing from something 
My mama told me I'm a be something (And I believe her)

[Verse 1]
A fist a wall tell my knuckles bleeding
Back over beefs, I'm screaming DOGG POUND GANGSTA
I'm fucked up from all the shit I'm drinking
Why I'm so deep, I remember I was a sack of semen
Know I'm 31, living the life that most niggas be dreamin
A nigga gotta hustle, stuck on what I believe in
Never take a punch and think that we even
Cuz the type of shit I'm on, it's some get back
Cuz I won't get it, 
Long as I'm breathin I'll think that's a good enough reason
I asks my mom all the time why god made it so hard?
For a nigga to make a living from breaking a law
I can't wait for six months without takin my job,
Back on my rear, they pull me over and now they take my car
(Mama Said that I'd be something) And I believe her
When my album hit the streets I'm strapped with four heaters
And I clutch peers, my heaters don't move for nothin
I'm tuckin, I'm clutchin, I'm bustin niggas who know me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I'm a survivor, I'm like the Eskimo in the North Pole
My blood line can adapt to the cold
You can lock me, the jail closed
I close my eyes and visualize in my mind and think I was home
I've been preached to all my life, I can think on my own
Cuz my mind's deep into their minds, so leave it alone
I'm entrapted with slurs and dread lines, runnin deep through my soul
Who knows? sometimes I made peace with my foes
I've been so deep into thought, that I bleed from my nose
I walk the streets with the heat, blastin pebbles and stones
I shed a bloody tear, for my thugs on top and bottom tier
In the streets motherfucker who should I fear?
My heart is beatin, I'm breathin, dealin, with viscous heathen
Im off the leash, and the pizza nigga stop me from eatin
Lessons are being learned, I'm wide awake, I feel like I'm dreamin
Chapow motherfucker! I think we even

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Keep my head above the water, let me talk to my lawyer
Facing cases of perpetration with a white mask on my face like Jason
Patiently waitin for this women and this women said there's no where to turn
So I smoke and I drink gin
For the judge that sentence me, nigga fuck you
Your the reason why my niggas turn to thugs too
Your the reason why my race in jail, with nothin to run to
Your the reason why we payin' our guns too 
Ugh, increase the smoke, and pull the liquor, 
All the earth visualize what it's worth
I walk the streets fly cousin, ridin' to die cousin
My nine will determine if I die, run and die, gunnin
Never seen death cousin? Your fuckin niggas bluffin
I park around with a nine shell in my stomach
Always do to die, be something, you know I keep bustin
with D-A-Z motherfucker
