Hook: Baby Bash {*Chiko Dateh ad-libbing*}
We did it twice last night (Last night)
And once in the mornin' (Mornin'...)
We did it twice last night (Last night)
And once in the mornin' (Mornin'...)
  
[South Park Mexican]
(Verse 1)
I pulled out my jimmy from the Cracker Jack box
The bulletproof vest blockin' all my cum shots
I got
One in London and her name is Regina
Then I got Sofia, she's from Argentina
Love 'em and leave 'em, hell nah, that ain't my style
I'd rather stick around for a good little while
At least twice a week if she's a good freak
Bitch left a hicky on my left butt cheek
Man
I'm as strong as an ox, and your baby mother's a bopper
We call her the head doctor and nobody can stop her
You need to drop her
Cause all she really wants is a baller
That spends fifty thousand dollars on a Mexican boxer

Repeat Hook

(Verse 2)
She's ridin' my pony, man she's horny
But it ain't no fun if I can't call the homie
Early in the mornin', watching Erkl while she blow me
When she see me with my girlfriend, she act like she don't know me
Cause she got love for me
My balls are never lonely, throw me crazy
With that ass and the pretty chicaronis
In my room jamming oldies, she's dancin' in her chonies
Had her screamin' in the tele til the neighbors called the police
So we had to take it else where, take 'em to the embassy
Picked up a stripper firm with lesbian tendencies
Half black and Japanese, gone on them Daiquiris
My bitch ate her out, while I filled up her cavities
Then we did it

Repeat Hook
  
[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
She grabbed me
By my paw, and I said, "Aw naw"
Rushed me to the bed and jumped straight on my drawer
The next thing she saw, playboy, wasn't small
She asked, "Baby Bash, can I please take it off?" (Fa sho)
Me and my yum-yum
Man, we was doing it big
She made me cum, cum
Damn, I think I woke up her kids
But we was on one
With some help of douja and wine
I gotta freak one
Ain't no bitch colder then mine
She got that platinum punana, fuck Madonna and Jenny Jenny
My mama be on that Remy, mixed with Henne when she get me
And when I get her, I got her
Hot than an enchilada
Oooh, she brought her friend too, now it's a menage-a-trois
Against the wall, I let the camera record
Got the berries and the crepes so we can never be bored
She kissed that teta, told her nena, "Would you please kiss your friend?"
She said, "You know I can, dadda, but is you joining in?"
I said, "For surely"
We started off slowly
Once it hit
Midnight, we went hard at 1:40
And then at 2:30
She started talkin' dirty
Got me feeling like a champ
When I dip up in the furry
Forty five minutes straight
Drippin' wet
Took a power nap
Six in the mornin', got her wetter than a shower cap
She was on top
And I was on under
The-buh, uh-buh, uh-bed, hit the wall, and it sounded like thunder {*thunder*}
