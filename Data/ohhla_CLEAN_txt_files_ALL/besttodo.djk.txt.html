[Intro] [Royce talking]
Yeah, Royce 5'9". The M.I.C. Walk with me. Talk with me.
A wise man once told me...he told me...he said...

[Verse One] [Royce Da 5'9"]
Back your bag, pick your punches
Know where you at and where you goin', fix your compass
Yeah, '06 is my year
Mo guns with no prints, for shit I'm prepared
Mo fun with your bitch
Well, now she my bitch, used to your bitch
Allow me to clear out the air
Yeah, I'm bout to pull out the pair
Stick out the thing, piss on the king
Like, get out the chair
Peel out and leave
Feel out the breeze
With the window down on the Vet
Shall I proceed?
Yes
The tattoo had to be in the right spot
To remind me of how notorious that my life got
True story
Used to hide the gat in my high tops
Adidas tracksuit, black and white like the White Sox
Feelin' as cold as an icebox
The older you get
You know where you stand
And you know when you might drop

[Chorus]
"Straight up and down, I'm the best to do it" - Elzhi
"You know the name" - Supastition
"5'9"" - Royce Da 5'9"
"Elzhi" - Elzhi
"Supastition" - Supastition
"Straight up and down, I'm the best to do it" - Elzhi
"The most impressive" - Elzhi
"Trust me I'm as live as it gets" - Royce
"Straight up and down, I'm the best to do it" - Elzhi
"And every rhyme that you find, playa I'm no joke" - Supastition
"Straight up and down, I'm the best to do it" - Elzhi
"The best kept secret, I guess that I just leaked it" - Royce

[Verse Two] [Elzhi]
Yo, the game is mine
I rewrote the famous line
Off of spittin' flames designed the same as Spawns
Truthfully
I'm R-A-W, a big raw
It puzzles you like when you fumble through a jigsaw
I own toys that fold ya homeboy
This is for, my young niggas holdin' chrome on Joy
12th and Lawrence
Glenn, Dexter and Cone
That show death to a opponents
For no less than a Donut
Get your weight up
And quit mean muggin' niggas
Like you with your sister and she just fit her A cup
I would have smashed you before my mustache grew
It's like you crash when you pass through to get your gas fuel
The ladies say I got a way with words
But they don't know the half
I'll write a blind man a photograph
Subliminal
Any imbecile and general
Can suck the identical genitals from the general
What

[Verse Three] [Supastition]
I got the flow down to a science
None is identical
Can't be duplicated like the sound of the ?finda roads?
Can it be stopped? Hell no
Not until the day that my cell close or hell froze
I be strong armin', throwin' Tony Jai elbows
Slangin' them mix tapes
Better my own buzz on the streets, fuck a big break
I wanna be mentioned with all the greats and pioneers
We heard back in the cassette tape and vinyl years
They say that my time is here
I ain't lyin' I swear
I'ma beast everything
I'm on my grind this year
From Elemental mag to XXL
I got love as well, without beef to double my sales
Don't let the smooth beats fool you
I'm rugged as hell
I million dollar flow, yet I struggle myself
Now
Let's make this clear
Some people will rob Supa this year
It disappears, the funds with quadruple

[Chorus]
