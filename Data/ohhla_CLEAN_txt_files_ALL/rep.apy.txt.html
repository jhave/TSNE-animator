[Verse 1 - Apathy]
As soon as they heard Apathy they tried to pull the batteries out the box
Rapidly drop when they reacted in shocks
They overloaded over-lord of the land, the mortal, the man
Who's sorta like a soldier with a sword in his hand
According to myth, a rapper that was born with a gift
The force of his spit could cause internal organs to shift
In the beginning non believers tried to force him to quit
Ignorin his wit now the suckas orbit his dick
Embracin in clubs fake smilin faces and hugs
Fabricated love all because he's makin a buzz
The snakes who hate went outside waitin wit thugs
To beat you down untill ya shit got traces of blood
Yall are new jacks to rap soundin spacey and bugged
I been spittin since ya mother had to lace up ya lugs
Face it it's over you tryin to move the base of a boulder
With weights on ya shoulders so stand back or wait till ya older
Lil' soldier.. trust me I got ways to control ya
I'm like God to the Devil - Ap is Satan's Jehova
I don't even write raps cause the paper would smoulder
So the flows are never over till I say that they over

[Verse 2 - Celph Titled]
They say a way to a man's heart is through his stomach
But I know a shortcut that's through the chest which ain't too far from it
Aint fuckin with cameras but I'm takin breast shots
My Gat bangs while you playin Max Payne on XBOX
Watch the lead chop a couple strands out ya dreadlocks
And send you niggaz J-walkin like you rockin S-dots
Swing midevil swords with lethal force behead ya soldiers
Not talkin soap but these bullets will clean ya head and shoulders
Arms back and torso kneecaps they all go
When we open fire at your little sisters horse show
Celph Titled the Rubix Cuban is shootin through ya roof with Rugers
Jumpin out the sewer in a scuba suit
Fuck with the Godz and fell the agony of hells grip
My niggaz throw grenades the size of Patti LaBelles tits
Rap about artillery but never had no parts of missles
Thought you had a gun but all you had was just a starter pistol

[Verse 3 - Motive]
Yo hatin me is only makin me more hungry and anxiously
To get mine and sit by more cake than bakeries
The Godz clique make hits but different from all of these artists
Yall sellin more fake shit than a damn flea market
I see part to most this industry is weak hearted
Yall see beef I'm servin niggaz like a meat market
So keep barkin cause real dogs we bite first
Yall can talk on the mics but in life my knife works
I'm ready for the game is it ready for me?
I done stepped beyond any level you define an MC
See, cats a joke actin like they hustle for cream
Knowin only Coke you push is on a vending machine
Well known and respected Motive hope you never forget it
Heads I embed it with a flow thats energetic
Fuck a vote I been elected
As a new mic weapon with a ill thrill style thats been perfected
Disrespect ya life can end in an instant
These MCs are like dykes act like men but really are bitches

[Hook] - 4X
Represent y'all, Represent

Connecticut nigga... dont get it twisted... Ain't nobody fuckin with it</pre>
