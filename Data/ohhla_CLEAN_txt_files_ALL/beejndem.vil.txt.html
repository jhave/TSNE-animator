Please blaze my dick like a blunt and
Make me want your cunt

It's all I want, that's all I ever want in my life...

You said you lookin for them niggaz yeah we be them

This year 'bout to blow up like some helium
I usually rock around 92 BPMS
Like BDM, the Lexus what you see me in
Homeboy don't ever step to S.V. again
Shoutout to 5 Illa, ain't no beef with them
Gotta say what's up to Al Shoes and Beej n Dem

Peace, let's get into flow again
We be them, niggaz yeah we be them

T3 got the same flow continuin
Y'all motherfuckers say the 3 don't be freestylin
I got a flow that got these hoes buckwhylin
I got you diggin and reachin for your wallet
You want it boy and you know who - got it
You claim original and sound like somebody

Been challengin niggaz and leavin 'em de-parted

Niggaz come back to life, yo, I do the usual again
Hoes is givin me blows, cause I'm a sexy man
Niggaz is comin with rhymes I ain't feelin
You think you know me boy I used to be a hard villain
Niggaz is mad cause they shit ain't genuine
