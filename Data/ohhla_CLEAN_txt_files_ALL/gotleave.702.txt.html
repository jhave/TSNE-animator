[Meelah]
You've got me pullin' out my weave
You got me cutting off my hair
You've got me so stressed out
[I can't think straight like you don't even]
Care how you do me like you do
Got the nerve to try and rule
Me like I'm your child
[I hate your style, you too buck wild]

1 - 	Why you do, what you do
	Keep on actin' like a fool
	Treat me bad, treat me cruel
	So I've gotta go

	Why you do, what you do
	Keep on actin' like a fool
	Treat me bad, treat me cruel
	So I've gotta go

[Meelah] (Missy)
Boy, I done had it up to here
So let's get one thing clear
Won't you check this out
[I'm not your girl, you're not my man]
(Understand) If this you don't know
Then I will tell you so
Get your hands off me
[Just let me go and let me be]

Repeat 1

[Missy]
Izzy izzy izzy
Party people move side-to-side
Let this joint go on bumpin' ya ride
Let the whole world feel it
Kick the bass, the low's and high's
Tell 'em crank that joint one time, ooh

Party people move side-to-side
Let this joint go on bumpin' ya ride
Let the whole world feel it
Kick the bass, the low's and high's
Tell 'em crank that joint one time, ooh

Repeat 1

[Meelah]
Why you do the things you do?

Why you do the things you do?
Keep on actin' like a fool
Ooh, ooh, ooh
