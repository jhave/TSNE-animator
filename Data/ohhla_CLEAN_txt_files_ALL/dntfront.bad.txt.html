Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse]
It all started with this patch reheard
And after that it came the sexual worst
I'm meeting shorty up to patch her a verse
She played body and I collide
With the vibe when I'm inside the walls
I cut my dotties on the side
'Cause I decide that she all mine's
I keep her in my eyes all the times
Not because I don't trust her
I just can't get enough of her
On the phone late until her mom dukes
Because of her, she played the hustle up
And I'm like mad 'cause most
Man swammin love and ain't afraid to admit it
Be blowing up a lime man I swear I'm addicted, but
It's all cool 'cause when I lie for ya I fool
They say men lie and women lay naked that's all for me
Don't be so mad after the first night
Right, so what the fuck is love at the first sight
If you ask me and not the stupid analogy
Makes it cover flaws in the female anatomy

[Chorus]
But I'm a keep gradually telling these bitches
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front though
I got some weed and some front though
(Don't front)
Hey you know I always hunt hoes
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door
Now don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Check
(Don't front)

[Verse]
It's like a massacre when less occur
I got a massive urge but I had to learn
Heard you had it on locks on pass away
I sat you heard sit back observe
That she make me feel good
Is all I ask of her
And the clouds they would've known
We would've crash and burn
I pray long and hard
Hoping things will last with her
I ain't mad at her
But I really wish that it ain't have to hurt
Let's be blunt we're best buds
Both knew our role this is more than just a crush
I used to pick a rub long before I lust to touch
But know I really even see it,
Everybody hurt not even the Lord
Force that we can keep up
If you don't wanna know start campin on the love
Everytime that we would kick it
I make sure I had some toe
I thought I knew her better than anyone would know
Begged her at her friends, but home then I would take her
Didn't know that she was a hoe
That only wanted my paper
Whenever I was with her, my mind was just relaxed
Could've been the high time because I swore we were a match in
I admit it girl you fine as hell
Don't know your perfume but you exhert the finest smell
You try to find it, I follow a trail
She left a few all other aside off the jail
That's all a part of the tale

[Chorus]
But I'm a keep gradually telling these bitches
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front though
I got some weed and some front though
(Don't front)
Hey you know I always hunt hoes
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door
Now don't front
(Don't front)
Don't front
(Don't front)
Check
(Don't front)

[Verse]
Hey yo don't tell me be patient
With no doctor prescription
Emotionally pretentious
And provocative figures
Should've known you missed a note
Like the eye would switch it
Remember hate the game
But she spot in some glitches
It's a simulation yeah
It's demolation
Take off your shirt
Let me feel manipulated
My heart like in Himalayas
But yeah I got the slayer
I'm crushing on you sweetheart
But yeah I'm a player
Sort 'em like I see 'em
Baby let me coach you
And I know I'm not the first jerk to approach you
So this ain't nothing new to you, nothing unusual
Nothing you ain't used to so my
Nothing is useable

[Verse]
We all try when you go by
We all hide, trush is
I'm never home
And I'm calling that's where
The heart lies
So label me as heartless
There's nothing I don't care
I just learned to use my heart less
The insanity and alot stress
It put me in a state
They just started taking the tone on me
Kept the secrets from me
Kept emotions how I hold belief
Always kept the L so I know defeat
So everything will feel much better as soon
As you know I'll leave
Now sure if this is the less of me
You think I'm mediocre
I was still body with a glove on
You know I'm coma, I'm in animal pause
But you got it off
When it flood I used to always feel like Noah
And I know I know her
Had this kind of skills I have to show her
I told her I'm the nigga
She seein' on the posters
Came back through
And I put it in the hostel
Just had to teach her one type
Put it down, don't really give a fuck though
Don't front
And tell your bitch don't front though
Don't front</pre>
