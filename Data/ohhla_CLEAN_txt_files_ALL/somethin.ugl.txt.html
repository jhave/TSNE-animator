[Grand Puba] + (Andy Cooper) + {Dizzy Dustin} [Andy + Dizzy]
Yeah, Grand Puba (UD, yeah)
Yeah, Andy Cat is ya with me
Yeah, big Dizzy is ya with me
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Yeah, here we go
(*Shit*) going down tonight [Tonight!]
Come on yo, it's only right [Uh-huh!]
This the jump off, shake ya ass off
Huh, back off, we 'bout to blast off
(It's ready to blow) {Getting outta control}
(Like, Iron Mike when he's out on parole)
{Something brand new} (To get them in the mood)
[Yo Pub] {Tell the people who we're sending it to}
This one goes to all of y'all
Who thought Grand Puba was 'bout to fall
Haters! Me fall, you out your mind
You got a better shot getting some ass from a porcupine
{We keep it movin like a Hula Hoop}
(Cause Einstein brought a loop that's tighter than a scuba suit)
[No dress code, no ID
It's a house party so you get in free]

[Chorus: Grand Puba] + (Andy Cooper)
This the jump off, shake ya ass off
(Something's going down tonight)
This the jump off, shake ya ass off
(With the groove to keep the crowd hype)
This the jump off, shake ya ass off
(Yeah, something's going down tonight)
This the jump off, shake ya ass off
(Back off and give us the mic, Einstein)

Da dum dum, da dum dum, da dum dum, da da
Da dum dum, da dum dum, da dum dum, da da
Da dum dum, da dum dum, da dum dum, da da
"If you like it, come on, get with it now."

[Grand Puba]
Burnin hot from the t-o-p
Pops shot me and my moms just caught an STD
Fake cats don't like me (Uh-huh)
Cause I put it down real on the CD
Like a nigga Spike Lee, hookin like Nike (Uh-huh)
Golddiggers don't play with my paper cause they know I turn Ike T, 
nice with the mic B
If you lookin for one of the best in the world you're barkin up the right tree

[Dizzy Dustin]
I got moves like Tom Cruise in "Cocktail"
Blaze on any stage, provin that I rock well
From my lung to the tip of my tongue
I exhale then excel when the record is spun

[Andy Cooper]
Showtime, I check the set list
Then I rock the mic from right hand to left
it's like I'm ambidextrous (Yeah!)
Ready to get this crowd to react to the track
And make 'em say (Come on back!)

[Chorus: Grand Puba] + (Andy Cooper)
This the jump off, shake ya ass off
(Something's going down tonight)
This the jump off, shake ya ass off
(With the groove to keep the crowd hype)
This the jump off, shake ya ass off
(Yeah, something's going down tonight)
This the jump off, shake ya ass off
(Back off and give us the mic, Einstein)

Da dum dum, da dum dum, da dum dum, da da
Da dum dum, da dum dum, da dum dum, da da
Da dum dum, da dum dum, da dum dum, da da

[Grand Puba] + (Andy Cooper) + {Dizzy Dustin} [Andy + Dizzy]
(The A side took you on a trip)
{But this is for the flip, like your middle finger tip}
(In flight, ready to strike like a meteorite)
{What time is it going down tonight?}
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
Fo sho, I'm gonna do the damn thing
Busta (*QUACK*) and take a shower, uh-huh
We dealin with the wisdom power, huh
{We rock and make the crowd get louder} Huh
You know we too sweet to be sour
(See you next time and we out like a prowler, shhh)
Huh, yeah, huh huh, yeah, huh, yeah, huh huh
Yeah, huh, yeah, huh huh, yeah, huh, yeah, huh huh
Yeah, we gonna get it jumped off
Grand Puba, Ugly Duckling
2K3, 2K4, still in the game, nigga
That's what's up, that's what's really up
Grand Puba style
"If you like it, come on, get with it now."

Thank you, and have a meaty good day. (*BEEP*)

Yeah, I'd like to lodge a complaint. I recently visited your outlet
in Long Beach and had a very unsatisfactory experience
They insulted my wife, they called me all sorts of names
like sissy, and, I just wanted you to know that
I'll be eating at Veggie-Hut from now on! (*CLICK!*)</pre>
