[Intro]
It don't get no betta than this (uh-uh)
Uh, uh, uh, uh
B-K muthafucka

[Verse 1]
It's a shame but, alot been change since we came up
I used ta run wit them, now I got my guns for them
Treat my hollows like trash, strait dumpin' 'em
Sauce Money show niggaz no love when I come for them
They thought they left a real nigga on his ass black
And that my numbers wouldn't rise like Nasdaq
And gotta re-half that, just pass that
We 'gon clash black for playin' the middle like ya ass crack
You can ball ova here, I play pass that
Exotic cats love ta talk peace when you blast back
No more fair ones, know you shot enuff of them
Don't really wanna do it, now you gotta fuck wit 'em
I'ma shit everytime that I hear ???
And make ya real ugly like bitter beer face
Sendin' fake thugs back ta the essence
Since my Rolex was a gift, there's no betta time than the present

[Chorus]
This one is for my hustlaz
(Right!)
Ladies don't tustle wit bustaz
(Not tonite!)
If you a dough gettin' swinga
Niggaz act funny wit cha money
Whatcha do?
(Give 'em the finga!) 

This one is for my hustlaz
(Right!)
Ladies don't tustle wit bustaz
(Not tonite!)
If you a dough gettin' swinga
Niggaz act funny wit cha money
Whatcha do?
(Give 'em the finga!)

[Verse 2]
I dedicate this ta cats want they cheddar ta rise
Fifty grand too much, O.K. Seventy-Five
Sauce Money kinda cat you could never despise
Hit the streets lookin' like you a betta disquise
Get a grip, I'm the preacher, you dance wit the devil
Whoever my eyes focus on is not on my level
Not even close, ex-girlfriends hatin' ta see it
You can give me brain or get out, take it or leave it
Relax wit side who, max wit my crew
Operation gettin' money, that's what I do
Insecure artists pay me not ta spit
Show me fake love and then try ta fly if they hit
They could feel it in they bones, cuz when I drop my shit
All hell'll break loose, that's how hot I get
I rock big in the summer, witout missin' the block
When I wanna get M, then I listen ta Pac
Scarface when I'm laid back, whippin' the 3
If I wanna hear that shit, then I listen ta me
Stick in the key, turn the knob and open the door
Prevokin' a war, cats saw us smokin' the 4, fo' sure
 
[Chorus]
This one is for my hustlaz
(Right!)
Ladies don't tustle wit bustaz
(Not tonite!)
If you a dough gettin' swinga
Niggaz act funny wit cha money
Whatcha do?
(Give 'em the finga!)
(Give 'em the finga!)
 
[Verse 3]
Look, I like ta come through and run up in 'em all night
Bring my man too, Mami if it's alright
I'ma a big one, but I like ta ball out
Sip Henny, smoke dro 'til you fall out
Hit 'em wit that Marcy maneuver, makin' 'em droppin'
I ain't met one yet make me take her shoppin'
But I might cuz I gotta lotta cash ma
Platinum Navigator glock when the stash ha
Rolex, Cuban Link, now the riddle comin'
Do I know about 69, a little sumthin'
I like ya point-blank style, you in it ta win it
But before I go downtown, gimme a minute
You got ta shower up, make sure no dirt in it
I got the Pro-Fo, neva eva squirtin' it
That's a thong, (damn), baby you just hurtin' shit
Bring that thing here baby, show me what you workin' wit

[Chorus]
This one is for my hustlaz
(Right)
Ladies don't tustle wit bustaz
(Not tonite)
If you a dough gettin' swinga
Niggaz act funny wit cha money
Whatcha do?
(Give 'em the finga!)

This one is for my hustlaz
(Right!)
Ladies don't tustle wit bustaz
(Not tonite!)
If you a dough gettin' swinga
Niggaz act funny wit cha money
Whatcha do?
(Give 'em the finga!)

[Outro]
This one is for my hustlaz
