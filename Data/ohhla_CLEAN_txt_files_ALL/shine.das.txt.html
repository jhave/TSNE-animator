Intro/Chorus:

If iggity-I shine then you shine
E'rybody shine, niggity-nuttin but the money on the mind
If I shine then you shine
E'rybody shine, niggity-nuttin but the money on the mind
If I shine then you shine
E'rybody shine, niggity-nuttin but the money on the mind
If I shine then you shine
E'rybody shine, niggity-nuttin but the money on the mind

Verse One: Dray

Well iggity-ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I'm miggity-makin all the money everytime I bust
No fuss, fully blown, Benz fully chrome
Flips celly phone, Diggy Das, once again it's on
It's Dray Boogie, no rookie, a tough cookie
Biggity-blow the spot everytime they book me
The big boys we're makin big noise
Biggity-bubblin and pushin big toys
&gt;From the corner to the stage, front page
Riggity-rockin the age, dropped the dime, please
So give a toast to the host, East Coast
West Coast, this here's just a small dose
Jump in the square this year, we take the whole pie
No lie, the platinum and the gold eye
Keep it jumpin, got the beat thumpin, pumpin
Yiggity-yes y'all, I know one thing

Chorus

Verse Two: Skoob

Yo, yo
I pliggity-play the back like a NFL safety
I wiggity-won't let the game break me even though the game's shaky
and the player's flaky, they niggity-need someone to boss em
Set up my office now e'rybody flossin
If niggas is hot, I'm ultraviolet
If niggas is fly then I'm the pilot, friggity-frequent flier mileage
Cash flowin, over throwin, motor rollin
Play the low and keepin niggas not knowin, yo
It's like the wind beneath my wing, everything that I sing
kid, I'ma bring, so let me do my thing
Knock the bastard, smiggity-smack it out the park, right
Sewer rats, tiggity-tales from the darkside archive

Chorus

Verse Three: Dray, Skoob

Yo
You buy the stocks off some sideblocks and buy Glocks to fight cops
Buy spots, niggity-never ever ride jocks
Bubblegoose, fat Benz, fat Timbs
Fat ends, fat rings, biggity-best scams
We got a fool-proof hustle, lotta muscle
So miggity-make sure to put the money in the duffle

Yo
What's miggity-mines is yours and yours is mines
If iggity-I shine then you shine, the crew shine
You rock the Benz, son, I rock the Range
Giggity-got nuttin to lose and e'rything to gain, I'm sayin
forget the pain and the struggle, and all the trouble
Up in the jungle wit my man now we're seein double
