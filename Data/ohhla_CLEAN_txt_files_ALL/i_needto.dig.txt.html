Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Oh [16x]

[Chorus]
I have it all and you on my team
If life start getting hard would you still want me?

[Verse 1]
I need to know..
What if I was just a common cat?
Wasn't tryna rap
And I wore a uniform, with a McDonalds cap
Would you see the ambition that's in my eyes?
Last week was mopping floors, this week it's the fries
Would you stick by my side?
Would you ride?
Would you roll?
Would you go?
Need to know, Need to know
Hit a slump
What if business was slow?
What if I couldn't sell tickets to shows?
Album was a brick in the stores

Uh, let me ask you do you seem just as Daniel
Or do you see the image that they market on the channels?
All these girls are acute but, I don't ever know they angle
At the rate I'm going I might end up being single

Now, put yourself in my Lu's
All they see is green they don't ever see my blues
Everybody watching, Leaving comments on my views
Got my head all knotted like that comic on the view
I love what I do, but I'm far from a happy camper
I ain't Happy Gilmore, that was Adam Sandler
It makes me wonder how come Yezzy didn't marry Amber
This world is greedy and sleazy
And that's my final answer

They going ham but I'm a go hammer
Try to keep a small circle I ain't trying go ham
I gotta muster up a smile when I'm posing for the camera
Watch me Chris Paul ya'll cause I got a sick handle

[Chorus]
I have it all and you on my team
If life start getting hard would you still want me?
I need to know, need to know
Are you with me for the long hall or if I fall off?
Would you still be the one I can call on?

I need to know... [4x]

[Verse 2]
I have everything to lose, you have everything to gain
I wonder would you still check for me if everything just changed
And the only things that's left is the memories
Of the days where money wasn't an issue
Would you go your separate ways?

Are you with me for the perks, using me as a provider?
Telling me "you're my boy"
Boy you preaching to the choir
You don't have to answer I can hear you speaking through your silence
Taking my love for granted like my weakness is my kindness

Sometimes I feel all alone in a crowded room
Gathering thoughts as I watch how everybody moves
Shaking my hand, taking photos, Twitpic-ing
To an opportunist, opportunities are Slim Pickens

Your mouth says, "What's Up" when all I hear is meal ticket
It's hard to say who's real, even harder to say who isn't
Since I don't know the difference, I come off as distant
Without a warm reception, people taking it as ya dissing
Are you kidding, where's the hidden cam?

Girls say they love you all along, it just a scam
And they got it all planned out
Friends got they hands out
Tell'em no, They say "how you turn your fam down?"
Oh, we fam now?
I ain't get the memo, funny that I didn't know you before I put out my demo
Now everybody want a slice, Kimbo
I need to know cause my mind's in limbo

[Chorus]

I have it all and you on my team
If life start getting hard would you still want me?

I need to know, need to know
Are you with me for the long hall or if I fall off?
Would you still be the one I can call on?

I need to know... [4x]</pre>
