[Chorus]
I been having fantasies of me and you
Thinking how it could be just me and you
Girl I'll be your other man
Your freaky deaky kinky lover man
Mr. Kiss- it where- you love- it man

(Trick Daddy):
(Girl I'm having) fantasies of me and you
(And I'm thinking) how could it be just me and you
(Girl I'll be your other man)
(Your freaky deaky kinky lover man)
(Mr. Lick- me- where- I love- it man)

Can't you see what I'm talking about
I wanna be the one to knock it out
Show you all the things that you need
There's no need for you to beg me please
I want you to understand
All I wanna be is your other man
Me for you, you for me
Make this thing a reality

[Trick Daddy]
Mean daddies play me I can't wait to break
Call your crib find the phone maybe your mom awake
No sense in worrying about my wife she's great
And I know that my conscience right she be okay
Make up a lie cause he ain't seeing you tonight
Hell yeah baby just me and you tonight
Just bring some clothes and the robe that you be having on
Behind closed doors who knows what be going on
Holding each other we be sucking on
Hell yeah deep in them gut says you grunt and moan
It ain't enough to chain me we fuck alone
These pussy juices been got my mind going the long
Go ahead man forgive me for I have sinned
69in wit my baby momma's closest friend
And she gotta man
But hell I understand (I know)

[Chorus] - 2X

[Trick Daddy]
I'll be your other man
Undercover first cousin even your brother's friend
No matter little momma girl I understand
I know you live wit your man, chill with your man
So we fuck only when we can
Juices all in the bar, fucking all in the car
Sleep around peep around only after dark
Yeah I know it's hard (but God gon' make it right for us)
Even if it means it will be (it'll be a special day for us)
Pray for us and let me ease your mind
Treat you right eat you from behind every time if you don't mind
I'll be your other man
Yeah I'll be your other man

[Chorus]

(Trick Daddy):
(Girl I'm having) fantasies of me and you
(And I'm thinking) how could it be just me and you
(Girl I'll be your other man)
(Your freaky deaky kinky lover man)
(Mr. Lick- me- where- I  love- it man)

Feel me like I'm feeling you
Open your eyes and see what I'm going through
I don't care if it's wrong or right
But I gotta taste that pussy tonight
Kiss you here kiss you there
Right between your toes girl I don't care
My mission is to please you
And make you see that all I wanna be
(Is your other man)</pre>
