Intro/Chorus: Das EFX, miss jones

Aiyo (yo), whut go around, no doubt come around
				Comes around, comes around
Das EFX we goin out, so yo bust the way it's comin down
Another day, another plot to scheme
Stock to cream, kiggity-can't stop my team
				Can't stop my team

Verse One: Dray, Skoob

Well iggity-open up, let me in so I could begin
Roll film at the slim trim ready to win
I got the (what?), head rocker, getcha tipsy like vodka
Don't mean to shock ya but I operate like a doctor
Show 'n' tell, excell past the start
(Makin grand with my man) Pushin luxury cars
Rock an ill rap (word), still strapped wit the rhymes
Diggy Das blow your mind, no doubt, one of a kind

Niggity-no digga, the tiggity-tongue flipper, the funk ripper
The bum sticker, d' ??? what nigga
I'm iggity-out to make a bundle in all spots
like the tiggity-tunnel, we start bleedin from the concrete
jiggity-jungle, we holdin it down, son, no diggedy
Niggas be wettin the flow, wet the flow, slippery
Hickory dickory, what up doc? We bust shots
Niggity-nuff props to all my people prayin up top

Chorus (x2)

Verse Two: Dray, Skoob

Yo
It's miggity-me Dray, what can I say? The flow's tight
See we do it all night just to keep the crowd high
by the side off the richter, get the spot rockin
No, we're never stoppin, higgity-hip-hoppin
The Hit Squad, takin charge, no diggy
Riggity-rip the flow and ya know we gets busy (kid)
when we come thru, miggity 1-2 mic check
So Boogie Bang diggity-drop your slang, they can't stretch

Yeah, yo, yo
I'm figgity-from the illest part of town, we get down to get found
So swim or drown, kid, kiggity-come up short or hold it down
Biggity-been to mad places, seen all these changin faces
Court cases, and riggity-rip shows for all races
Son, I diggity-do my thing for the CREAM, the higgity-hip-hop fiend
Kiggity-call me The Dream like Hakeem
Figgity-finger on the trigger, vision on the sparrow
The diggy dark shadow, holdin it down and camouflage your town

Chorus

Verse Three: Skoob, Dray

Higgity-hungry man like Swanson, give up like Charles Bronson
and giggity-guess it's just the things I do like ???? ????
Got these hookers car hoppin, and stiggity-star gazin
Keep em movin, I'm wiggity-with my mans and that needs no provin

??? ???? P-E-T, see me on B-E-T
I roll with PMD, and see we D-I-P, my stee
lo, stiggty-stay in a diggy-day out
I keep it way out, it's Diggy Das, kid, never played out

Chorus (x2)
