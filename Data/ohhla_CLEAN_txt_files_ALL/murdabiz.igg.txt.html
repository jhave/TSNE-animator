[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Iggy. Do it biggie
tell 'em keep sending bottles, Ima pop 50
these other bitches think they hot?

[T.I.]
Outfit, perfect
hit the scene, hurt shit
In the 911 I'm in 87, merk shit
Holocaust, genocide
killin' ego, and they pride
creamating the hating, it's amurda in the making
I'm taking out shine on top
buy all bottles from the bar, let's pop champagne
let them niggas die of thurst, man we'll by a hearse
when the light hit the chain all you see is fire works
un-mute niggas turned up all the way
shoot nigga with the swagged out holiday
I'm steady blowin' loud, broke niggas ain't allowed
click clack bang bang, pow pow
it's a Murda Bizness

[Chorus]
Hit the club
