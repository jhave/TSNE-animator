[Method Man sample]
Murder, Murder, Mur murder, Murder
Murder, Murder, Mur murder, Murder

[Verse 1]
See everybody think that they untouchable, Till they find theyself in the mix 
Getting fucked like a bitch shit 
I don't give a fuck about yo' muscle, I'ma kill you quick 
And whoever you connected with
The time, Is 6:38
When my flight touched down at JFK
Had the homie Big Rick pick me up
Man he had the heaters in the spot and everything that we discussed
It's cold as fuck, Probably like 20 below
Took a sip of 'nac just to help the blood flow
Calculate my steps, You know my rep
My job ain't done till you breath yo last breath
Gotta move swift when I'm on the set
Cause the mark I'm trying to hit is mob connected
No problems I don't play to lose
And I'ma make him an offer that he can't refuse
Cause it's

[Chorus 2x]
Cause it's COLDDDDDDDDDD
Murder, Murder, Mur murder
Why? Why? Why? 
Murder, Bloody murder
Thought you was a wise guy but now you gotta die! 
[Gunshot]
Thought you was a wise guy but now you gotta die!
[Gunshot 2x]

[Verse 2]
See everybody think that they bulletproof
Till they find they ass crossed up and they neck's in a noose
Shit, You outta luck cause I'm cold as ice
Have you on yo knees begging and pleading I don't take ya life
The time, Is 9:34
I'm out in Flatbush, Brooklyn casing Willie Broscoe
And everybody know Willie
He the main muscle for the mob in this part of the city
But fuck him, I don't know Willie
And he wrote a check he can't cash by fucking wit my homies
The Psychopathic Assassin, Smash on any bitch ho
Even if ya whole family gotta go
So fuck Willie Broscoe
He gon feel the strength of the hatchet when I hit him with the roscoe
Cause we don't never play to lose
And we gon make him an offer that he can't refuse
Cause it's

Chorus 2x

[Verse 3]
Everybody think that they a good guy
Till they find theyself staring down the barrel bout to die
Shit, I don't give a fuck cause it's too late
You slimy motherfucker you a great big waste
The time, Is 8:30 AM
It's been three days now, I've been clocking him and plotting on him
He at the local coffee shop
He meeting with Vito and Tony and they making a drop
Move, They handle business real quickly
He got a latte to go then he jumped in his Bentley
Now it's close to nine o clock
He goes to get a massage at the spa up the block
Uh, He like the Asian chick little bitch big tits
A bad bitch turning tricks for tips
And when she got him totally relaxed
I blew his brains to smithereens and cancelled his contract
Cause it's

Chorus 2x

[Narrator]
The hit was a success
But before 187 could even relax
He was informed by a confidante that his father's killer 
The Black Swan had been spotted in Atlantic City
Immediately, The Psychopathic Assassin was off on the hunt again
Only this mission is personal</pre>
