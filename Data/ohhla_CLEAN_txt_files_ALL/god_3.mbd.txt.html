Nah fuck that, go, go open the window real quick Son
Open that fuckin window

Yo hold up

Oh shit!  C'mere c'mere c'mere c'mere, turn the lights out

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
(Yo it's the) G.O.D., Father Pt. III
QBC, sip lime Bacardi
Heavy on the wrist, cube-link, my ice ring
Drama we bring, yeah/yo that's a small thing

[Verse One: Prodigy]
Awright now, pay attention to the crime rhyme Houdini P
Keepin you niggaz in perspective
Mobb, representative, call me the specialist
Professional, professor at this rap science
Up in the labratory, here's why your small rhyme bore me
Store bought rap ain't shit, my category
is that of an insane who strike back (what?)
I draw first blood, it's over with, and that's that
You wanna square off, forsake and slice that cat
You get splashed, from back of your head, to ass crack
Surgical signs to the end, with iron map
Which bring, apocalypse to this game called rap
Not a game but quite serious and yo in fact
You'll be runnin for dear life so far you might fall off the map
Fuckin with P, you need a gat
At least to have the opportunity to bust back
First shot the motherfucker pack around world premier
Shook individual bound from blind fear
Scared to death niggaz fall to they worst fear
Horror tales in braille, for vision impaired
You lookin for P, well you can find him everywhere
In a project near you, I'll be right there
I was brought up and taught to have no fear (now)
Live wire niggaz stay behind me in the rear (now)
Cowardly hearts, step aside, stand clear (fear)
My bloodthirsty niggaz got they eyes on you
QBC, lime Bacardia, G.O.D. Father Pt. III
On some hashish, to Embassy Suite, crash your party

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Havoc]
Yeah yo, lime Bacardi, gettin bent, crash the party
Handle B-I, bringin it to anybody
Physical damage, crowd control handle cannons
Hittin you ripped, leave your bloodstream contamin-ed
While you actin out of character, we observin
Drillin em down so hard, I know we felt you comin at em
Hennessee raps float like the Phantom
Runnin you up out of the spot in which you standin
Never second-guess a cat who hold gat
Concealed, but easily revealed and fast
Body castin raps to get your back snapped in half
and severed, impossible pain beyond measure
Sheisty living brought him to his last bread (bread)
Life changed around quick to one stead (stead)
Face full of fear, conquerin your ice grill (grill)
Tragedies, put him to sleep like NyQuil (NyQuil)
Givin a overdose of this rap potent
Potentially dangerous, fatally left open
for the roaches, scavengers, that's EMS
Funeral homes, anticipatin your death
That's the dead truth, check in the morgue, you'll find proof
Enough to make you think and stop before your ship sink
to the bottom, night owl leave the mark and spot him
You know the routine, face up before I shot him

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
