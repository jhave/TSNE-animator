[Intro]
Ay sometimes in life you go through things right?
(Talk to 'em!) But if you're as strong as I am man
You rebound soon as the ball come off the rim
(I know about that!) That's what we do over here
The Street Fam (that's what we do over here)
{"Gangsta, gangsta..."} Oh!
It's Loso just in case you ain't know so
(DJ Drama) Feels good {"Gangsta Grizzill!"}

[Chorus]
Say hello to the bad guy, they say I'm a bad guy
You can't get a good look from a bad eye
It's like wearin a good suit with a bad tie
And I ain't do shit, just imagine had I
say I'm a bad guy, say hi to the bad guy
You can't get a good look from a bad eye
It's like wearin a good suit with a bad tie
And I ain't do shit, just imagine had I
I, I, I

[Fabolous]
Fuck I need with another chain?
My nigga Raj just seen his brother slain
I'm tryin to feel the brother pain
Cause I know it's no way I could get another Caine
Bad thoughts be on a brother brain
I'ma ride, I'm just in another lane
Can't stand to see my mother strained
or stressed over all the bullshits of the game
So, I'm with dark-skinned Lorraine
Parked in the Range, sparks in my chains
Yeah, I've been marked in the fame
That's why the lenses are dark in my frames
Tryin to clean dirt marks from my name
I ignore remarks from your lames
I know Brooklyn got my back
My rearview's the only way that I am lookin back
to hello, uh, say hello, uh
To L.O., uh, to L.O.S.O.

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
I think my girl gon' have to find another nigga
I'm tryin to tell her I am not that other nigga (that's not me)
When I met her she was with another nigga
She must still think that I'm the other nigga (damn~!)
Before her head got bigger
Before that shit we was Beyonce and Jigga (I mean it looked that good)
I can't complain and say that she a gold digger (nah)
But like 'Ye said, she ain't fuckin with broke niggaz (nah)
But tell me have you ever lost somethin nigga?
It's like the stage coach turned into a pumpkin
She be tryin to judge me, without a gavel and a robe
But she ain't been nowhere and I done been around the globe
They see me ridin young cold
And the diamonds in my lobes, shine brighter than strobes
... then again
My swag kicks in, that's when the bad guy begins
Say hello, uh, say hello, uh
To L.O., uh, to L.O.S.O.

[Chorus] - fades out</pre>
