Song:   Bittersweet
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This is a symphony
The bittersweet of life, of life
Walk on with your scars, don't turn around
Run utill you see light, till you see light

Yeah. Uh
The long road to success is dangerous
That's why I never claimed I was the best
I want to be their breath
Don't want to be the king
Ain't tryin to be your god, just want to live my dreams
But an ordinary thing, history I'm a make
Typically, those great have predetermined faith
Mostly 'cause niggaz hate you, tryin to fill up your plate
Nigga's carnivore when there's so much at steak
Ain't tryin to fight no war against my brother
But I'm a man first and I demand my respect from all 'em
Success sweet, nucka, is why I keep lookin'
But every other bite it slightly needs suga
Like whenever I look up, I'm expecting the light
I'm abusing the sunshine so I'm technically blind
Translation cause my life is too sweet
I can always go home and look down my street
(It's bittersweet)

This is a symphony
The bittersweet of life, of life
Walk on with your scars, don't turn around
Run utill you see light, till you see light
This is a bittersweet life (life) [x2]

Uh, this bittersweetness of this artform
Niggaz will find a way to tweak it till the art's gone
Understand every imperfection
I just embrace it and take it in within my essence
With little effort, soon they will all respect it
I am the smelling-salt to whom soever narcoleptic
Success is what I work for, and when them dudes hate
They make it worth more
Chris Wale said the sky was the limit
And only make news when your quarters are in it
So I'm a push it to the end and take quarters on shots
If I'm in gin till I win it
Or pain kill it, cause I ain't tryin to feel it
See I'm just tryin to fill up banks like Hilla-
Read all about me, believe that without me
There is truth in these lies and they bleed on without me

This is a symphony
The bittersweet of life, of life
Walk on with your scars, don't turn around
Run utill you see light, till you see light
This is a bittersweet life (life) [x2]</pre>
