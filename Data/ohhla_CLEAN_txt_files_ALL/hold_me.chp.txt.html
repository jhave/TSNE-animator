Song:   Hold Me Down
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
You are
You're my nigga you're my brother you're my friend
You are
Will you hold me down until the very end
You are
You're my bitch an' you're my lover you're my friend
You are
Will you hold me down until the very end
You are

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I wake I bake I drink I meditate
Thinking of better ways to live on this earth and get my cedar straight
Bout to hop of in that Lexus got that watches extra fresh
Yeah I moved out at that hood but you would think I never left
Just rolled two blunts and try to smoke 'em alone
Bout to bend around the corner and see if my nigga's home
When people tell you "Grow up" they really mean you alone in this world
You gonna realize it or what
But we are naïve thank God for weed
Thank God for clientele thank God for greed
You can try to stop my song but you won't cc
That big money in my fan tight is all I'd leave
Fuck what you've all niggas done

[Chorus]
You are
You're my nigga you're my brother you're my friend
You are
Will you hold me down until the very end
You are
You're my bitch an' you're my lover you're my friend
You are
Will you hold me down until the very end
You are

[Verse 2]
Watching first the 48 depression is all there hasn't the episode yet
But the nigga didn't till [?]
But ho really knows unless you witnessed it
All them stories that we heard and can't prove do they exist
Temptation is the reason why my girl pissed off
She went through my phone and you already know what she sow
This life has it's ups and downs just like a sea saw
And we all try to keep our solid feet on solid ground but we fall
Been through it and I ain't starved yet
Yeah I get love but sometimes I can't tell if it's really fake
Till the world ends I wanna drown in paper
All we have is trust all that matters is now or later
Fuck with your nigga girl

[Chorus]
You are
You're my nigga you're my brother you're my friend
You are
Will you hold me down until the very end
You are
You're my bitch an' you're my lover you're my friend
You are
Will you hold me down until the very end
You are

You're my nigga you're my brother you're my friend
You are
Will you hold me down until the very end
You are
You're my bitch an' you're my lover you're my friend
You are
Will you hold me down until the very end</pre>
