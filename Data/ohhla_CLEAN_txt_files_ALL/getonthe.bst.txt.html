Song:   B-Boy Bouillabaisse: Get On the Mic
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
One two
Right about now I'd like to dedicate this song
out to my main homey Mike D
Aight? Ready... go
Get on the mic, get-get on the mic
Just get on the mic, get on the mic Mike!

[Verse One]
Let's be real and don't cloud the issue
The rhymes are rope, an emcee you must listen to
People say that they been missin me and missin you
Get on the mic and let's show them like we used to
  Well, you say fuck, yo homes, fuck this!
  I'm King Ad-Ram and you're Dick Butkus!
One half science
  And another half soul
Nickname Mike D not Fat Morton Jelly Roll
  Got busy in Frisco, fooled around in Fresno
  Got over on your girlie cause you know she never says no

So just get on the mic, just get on the mic
Just get on the mic, get on the mic Mike!

[Verse Two]
Well Mike D, is a special individual
  Pullin out knots
And pullin in residuals
  Go to the movies get the Rolos
The cholos ridin slow and low
  Mike on the mic
And bust with the solo
Mike my stromy, don't be so selfish
Get on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish</pre>
