[Intro]
Tragedy Khadafi..
Mahdi!
Against All Odds..
For all my thugs in the struggle
Feel me on this yo..

[Verse 1]
Yo
Velvet garments, gun holster under armpits
Mahdi, part thug, God, part Islamic
Breastfed with Henny, our fathers was convicts
Sold garbage, gave our souls to the harlots
Helicopters and choppers hover above us
Face the jury and the judges with foul grudges
No one to love us, the streets kidnapped our mothers
They cried liquor, caught in the hood gettin' smothered
With no guidance, we grew without fathers
Stuck them coke spots, the little 'shakahalas'(?)
From Kufis to bandanas, spread like Kansas
Read the Black Panthers, tryin' to find answers
Willin' to take, whatever life wouldn't hand us
Move in packs, hustlin' crack under cameras
They learned to hate us, cuz they could never understand us
Against All Odds, God, tell me what the plan is

[Chorus]
Against All Odds, the saga of my life
In the world full of trifeness and courtroom indictments
Friendship is rare, trust is a luxury
Thugs die young or threw they whole life in custody
Against All Odds, the saga of my life
In the streets, robbin' niggaz just to eat at night
Doin' time, have a nigga mind mentally scarred
Me and my thugs go Against All Odds..

[Verse 2]
Me and my wife made vows for life, never divorcin'
Half plastic and half porcelain, for them snakes
Who'd rather see me in a coffin, have my seeds
Cryin' over me in dead corpses
This is 2-5, came too far to take losses
From the crack game to the rap game endorsements
No middle man, dealing strictly with bosses
I can't stop till I'm in the drop cockpit
Success and death, and death is not a option
We mashed to this, and now we got it locked in
The new millennium two-thou, this world is too foul
Criticize your past, not what you do now
Prepare for these modern-day Hitlers
Judge me, walk in my shoes and catch blisters
I fought drug addictions, shed blood in prisons
Survived in hard-times, impossible missions!

[Chorus]
Against All Odds, the saga of my life
In the world full of trifeness and courtroom indictments
Friendship is rare, trust is a luxury
Thugs die young or threw they whole life in custody
Against All Odds, the saga of my life
In the streets, robbin' niggaz just to eat at night
Doin' time, have a nigga mind mentally scarred
Me and my thugs go Against All Odds..

[Verse 3]
We fought our way through this rap game, when no one would listen
Now we on top, where rocks and jewels glisten
Concentrated on, the one they hated on
Reincarnated in greater form, it's on
Can't please the world till you leave this world
Sometimes I wish I never put seeds in my girl
'Cuz women got two faces, one in the bedroom
The other one, lyin' in court givin' you cases
The system, in your pockets, cuttin' you short
Takin' niggaz to court, for child support
What about all the times that I gave you my last
Was our love just a thing of the past, I gotta ask
Tell me, should I cry or laugh?
Do I run from my enemies or stand and blast?
Do the knowledge to the words that I write in this song
Young thug and you won't go wrong, just hold on

[Chorus 2x]
Against All Odds, the saga of my life
In the world full of trifeness and courtroom indictments
Friendship is rare, trust is a luxury
Thugs die young or threw they whole life in custody
Against All Odds, the saga of my life
In the streets, robbin' niggaz just to eat at night
Doin' time, have a nigga mind mentally scarred
Me and my thugs go Against All Odds...</pre>
