Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Okay~!

[Chorus]
Light-skinned girls, you can put it in my video
Dark-skinned girls, you can put in my video
Thick girls, you can put it in my video
Thin girls, you can put in my video
Smarty art chicks, you can put it my video
Dumb hoes, you can put it in my video
Smooth girls, you can put it in my video
Nerd girls, you can put it in my video

[Childish Gambino]
I'm blowin up like my swagger on the Gaza
I'm writin movies where I'm makin out with Aubrey Plaza
And homegirl my homegirl, it is not like that
But if she tried to rape me, I would not fight back
Girls who turned me down are sayin "please" and "sorry"
You lucky that I'm randy, Aziz Ansari
So now I'm in the club tellin strippers they should back it up
I wanna hang with Lil Wayne I just hope that I'm black enough
Damn! I guess we're all friends here
Except for I don't know you, like you was me last year
It's funny how these niggaz all treat me like we best friends
I wanna fuck these small girls, minus "S-M"
Meaning that I fuck all girls, that is word play
Catch me on my iPhone doin what the birds say
I ain't goin nowhere, somebody better tell a hater
He's goin down like my living room elevator
Fuck what you heard bitch, I'll fuck your fuckin brains out
And make you wash your boyfriend's sheets to get the stains out
Put your fuckin boots on, it's time to kick the lames out
You got your favorite rapper in your ear, it's time to change out

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
Watch your girlfriend, I'll fuck her then I up and leave her
Girls chase me like they think my dick is Justin Bieber
Pussy thrown at me, you fuckin with a wide receiver
I'm a genius, and I ain't try to hide it either
Got a lot of hay, let me pay for what you sip tonight
Mixed girls from Williamsburg, that's my fuckin kryptonite
Baby girl, shorty have it however you want it
Whatever you asking 'bout, I promise you that I done it
My swagger's New York, but my home is the South
And it's amazing how I eat more pussy than +Alf+
And I'll all up in your ear but then I'm all in your mouth
I don't talk, but girls the only thing we're talkin about

[Chorus]</pre>
