Uh, uh, yeah, gangsta shit
Takin my word, y'all want this
They don't want none of me
They don't want none of me
Yeah, please believe it
Rule baby, unquestionable
Uh, uh, but you know that
Heck, I know that
Uh, ha, yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
What has this world come to
When a nigga like me could be perceived the American Dream
Life aint always what it seems, my younguns
Please believe strugglin, always provokes the hustlin
To that we accustomed
You get acquainted with everybody throughout the hood
Still don't trust 'em
Trust is a serious thing
Most niggas don't trust nobody they aint know since sixteen
Does that mean the devil is in us, of course
Who you think is holdin us up to fall short
Touch but don't taste, taste but don't swallow
And these are the rules that we 'posed to follow
People pray for eternity, never see tomorrow
They just, wishin the Lord would take 'em away from the horror that
I'm currently, bringin, y'all motherfuckers gonna hafta
Murder me, swingin bud, I won't die

[Verse 2]
Hear what I'm sayin, y'all niggas better start sayin prayers
Cuz a nigga wit no cares, is finally here
Say what I want, when I want, fuck police
Cuz my gangsta niggas know we own the streets
With the wind beneath my wings, ground under my feet
I'm the black rose nigga that grew from concrete
It's the Rule, get it right, or get it real hot
A whole lotta shots sent flying through your block [gunshot]
The one I need, and, oh, before I leave
Does anybody else feel they don't wanna breathe
Been menacing this society since conceived
And nigga you know cold hearts don't bleed
Still they, pray for eternity, never seein tomorrow
They just, wishin the Lord would take 'em away from the horror that
I'm currently, bringin, y'all motherfuckers gonna hafta
Murder me, swingin, the Rule won't die...</pre>
