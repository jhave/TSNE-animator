Intro:
Kane got it goin' on. Hey girl I didn't mean it. Hey a sweet love a sweet
love. Girl I didn't mean it. Check it out. 

KK:
I never should of tripped with a girl in a woman's place
But it was all in her thighs and her cute face
Now see baby kind of sexy yeah she got it goin' on
But damn did she have to go and get sprung
Young girl now let me think
Can I get your attention with my left eye wink
Or maybe please can I call you baby
Will a buldge in my pants drive a young girl crazy

Singing:
How could it be
She gave her body so easily
Next was sex on top of me

KK:
Or did I make it too good for ya baby
Now peep KKs another yeah
A step down from a lover but no farther then friends
Ya see I got a plan like I always said ya know
Girl I gotta go gotta go now see

Hook:
Baby I really didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on (x2)

Now baby tell me what's goin' on 
The way you treat a nigga you know it's wrong now

Singing:
Bitch come down take a ride with me
I'll show you how things are suppose to be

Like killing that cat from the back
Brake it down to the floor 
With a 20 sack of love you don't hear me though
Now baby baby

Singing:
You gotta put your face up or either raise up (yeah)
Cause when it comes to lovin' I got a lot of huggin'
And you can be my muffin

So don't be surprised if I lick up in between your thighs
And make you cream on yourself
Cause I'm pack the proper love that can stay on swole
And make that money straight fold
So if you ready I can give you the world
Just get it like that you go girl

Hook

Now baby relax take a sip of the Conjac of Henessy
When you finish me cause we can do that
So don't be shy (just turn around a minute)
And spread them thighs
(And know I'm all up in it)
Strokin', pokin' and teasin' 
Cause I'm the only one that be pleasin'
I'm lettin' you know I'll treat you fair
So come on let me take you there

Now you gotta make it easy as can be 
If you wanna come kick it with a fool like me you know
(I can make it better) Hey only if you let it
(What's up with you and me girl?)
Baby can I wet it
Now you wanna run you're tryin' to make me chase
Sweet honeybun can I get a taste?
Sex don't have to be if you don't want it to be
But when it's time to make it happen make it happen with me
But...

Hook 
Did you do it like this? Then you can do it like that. Do you make it feel
good? I can make it real good. (x2)
