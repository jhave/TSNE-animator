Chorus: Lil' Romeo (repeat 2x)
I wish I was tall like you 
I wish I could ball like you, like you
You know i like to walk like you, like you
Thats why I talk like you, like you whoody whooo

[Lil' Romeo]
When I grow up i wanta be just like you
Eat drink sleep whatever, just like you
Finish school cause bein a fool ain't cool
When I walk past them same corners just like you
I got hopes and dreams
By the time I'm thirteen I wanta tote around the whole world
Know what I mean?
I play ball like you used to crawl like you
I had 36 the other day, I even score like you, walk like you, talk you
Everything I do my friends say remind me of you
Its you, who made me act like I do 
It was you who told me what I could and couldn't do
Never told me no, just advised me of what to do
Kept me bouncin balls as I recall the age of two, shootin freethrows 
Okay I made a few
Dad where you at? I need you in the booth

Chorus: Lil' Romeo (repeat 2x)

[Master P]
Its a family thing, so I got your back
I mean we teammates son like Kobe and Shaq
And when your momma tell you somethin I mean listen to her whodi 
Respect your elders that what your granpa told me
I mean times have change we growin up together
The first father and son to rap and blow up together
Blood is thicker than water
I know you tougher than leather
But I be on you cause I want you to do better
I done been on these streets, I done lived that life
I mean why do wrong and you can do right
Say no to drugs
Education goes far
You can be a doctor lawyer politician or star
You wanta be like me son then make me proud
And when you get that diploma don't forget to smile

Chorus: Lil' Romeo (repeat 2x)

[Lil' Romeo]
Yo pops you tha one
 
[Master P]
Yo son you tha one
I love you son

[Lil' Romeo]
I love you pops

[Master P]
Cause when its all said and done, we all we got
But we won't stop, we won't stop, This No Limit Family we won't stop</pre>
