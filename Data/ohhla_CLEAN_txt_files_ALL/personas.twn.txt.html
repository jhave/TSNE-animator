Yeah, yeah, Young C, what you can say
Fuck all ya'll motherfuckers who wanna touch us, touch our hip-hop
Yeha, for real, do you keep it real?
Yeah, F.U.C.K.- dis is talk of Young C, let's go

[Young C]
My persona just like big anaconda
Attack immediately without pause in a minute
Adrenaline burn in a body &amp; wanna blow ya
Put shit on ya, we'll not be mourn ya
We make from you a pone, real slim, put you low
You don't know, who iz Young C of T.W.I.N.Z
Persona just like anaconda, hip hop wanna
Was born ain't in a Bronx or Queens Bridge
In a ghetto my soul was born to get a link
Wit good world, make dis cord mo longer
Fuck your dreams, fuck your trims
Ya ass will be soon victim, you lookin sick, man
I ain't Cholo, my body iz swoll for
Ol' Skool forever, you will be me remember
Me just like kifner, for my shit will lifter
Just like Pun &amp; Joe Crack, returned white rap back
Wit own band Terror Squad- me iz terror for ya
Coz my family ain't like suckers for rap game
Man, our life iz lookin on a game

[Chorus]2xs
Ol Skool motherfuckers- dat's our persona
Better pray for us coz you can be in a comma
You'll be pray for ya momma, check our gramma
Suck my dick, motherfucker! Fuck You-You not good rhymer

[Dazzle Kid]
My persona lookin on a Yonker or Vato
I'ma not stunner, coz my purse often empty like in a gutter
I was born not in Havana- like Castro or Che Gevara
Had riot in a soul
You asshole, go front on me
Dunno me, can do subliminal shot, just like Pac
Time was hot, some ain't got money on shoes
So he move in a way of robbin, drugdealin, cap peelin
Some can't buy himself some socks or kerchiefs
Some don't streets feel at 17, but got gift
A talent from God, so he gotta
Make a bang on a scene or blow punani
Some write sagas, freestyles &amp; he can save
His lifestyle from cowards &amp; dumb ass bitches who bark as
Dogs, like sheperd or wit reitweller, you scare to holla
Your bro'z who tryna guns toss and motherfuckaz
Who tryna snitch you, fuck ya'll, you heard me
Just like Joe, but not legends of streets
They beasts earn raw when other bro rest in piece
Shit became immediatly, all shit is legally
Only some can say language illegally, finally
Mentality is lethally, feelin it (You heard me)

[Chorus]2xs
Ol Skool motherfuckers- dat's our persona
Better pray for us coz you can be in a comma
You'll be pray for ya momma, check our gramma
Suck my dick, motherfucker! Fuck You-You not good rhymer

Feel it son, keep it real, dis is Twinz, two broz-two twinz, mofucka
check dis!!

[Chorus]2xs
Ol Skool mofuckaz- dat's our persona
Better pray for us coz you can be in a comma
You'll be pray for ya momma, check our gramma
Suck my dick, mofucka! Fuck You-You not good rhymer

Yeah, dis is rap game time, fuck fake ass mofuckaz, who tryna be ol'

We not trully on 100% ol' skool soldiers, but we tryna, so..</pre>
