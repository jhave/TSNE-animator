[Intro]
Yo Bigs man, what's wrong man?
You look like you got problems man

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Hey yo man, pssh man
It's this fuckin BITCH man~!
Shit I know I ain't 'sposed to have
no feelings for these hoes out here man, but
This bitch on the back of my mind man (word?)
Yeah man... done wrote a rhyme 'bout the bitch man
(Let me hear it) Want me to drop the drama kid? (Yeah)

Yeah, dedicatin this to you man
Cause my man 50 Gran' told me straight up and down man
I ain't 'sposed to love no ho
Knahmsayin? I tried to tell her 50
I got three rules in life
I'm not to be played with, played on or played out
I'ma drop it like dis

[Verse One]
Lyin in my bed, I'm lookin at four walls
Echo in my head sayin I got a lot of gall
Grippin my cap, my pen in my teeth
Thinkin what this ho said, she called me a thief
She said I stole her heart, and didn't leave a trace
I told her I was sorry and she said get out my face
Walked out my door with my Walkman in my pocket
Playin "Love Is a House," and thinkin how she jocked it
when she had the key, to open up my door
Adore, that Prince scam that got me on the floor
I know that she loved me, I couldn't ever fake it
I say go buy a pie, the girl would go bake it
Makin a record was important to me
More important than her that's what made her flee, see
The mistake was not payin no mind
All her posse said we was two of a kind
I call her back twice, your sister said you're broke
She said when you left, your ears was full of smoke
Chokin on a cigarette you don't even smoke
Jumped in the train station put in a token
Coulda been my partner, my amigo my peer
Just waitin for them three words that all girls wanna hear
I love you, HUH, you would start to cry if
I would reply with I-L-Y
Then I tell your friends that you played me out
Said I wouldn't say "I love you" just to make you shout
So I, call up 7 digits that would pick up your phone
Your sister picked it up and said that you wasn't home
I heard you in the back cryin up a storm
Screamin how you wish that I never was born
"I hate him! I hate him!" That's what she kept sayin
She'll come to her senses is what I kept prayin
But now I'm gonna lay the cards on the line
Just say that you hate me, or say that you're mine
I said, when I played ball you was in the stands
When I was sick, you held my hand
It was hard to say before, but now I can
Bitch I love no ho, FUCK YA~!

I don't give a fuck about'cha
Take a long walk off a short peer bitch
Try to take bankrolls
Bum bitches outta here 50 man
Now check it

[Verse Two]
Come to my crib she say B.I.G. listen
I don't like the way you been dissin
Feel like I been kissin other bitches cause my lips feel chapped
I tell you it's on the blunts, you ain't tryin to hear that
Now I'm Henny'd like a fuck? What's the riff?
Who I'm sleepin with? I ain't got the time
to shoot the gift to hoes, I'm tryin to take bankroll
I ain't fuckin nobody, case closed
You hit the lights and decide to doze off
No kiss goodnight, didn't take your clothes off
And my dick is harder than a rock
Nobody to cockblock but youse a hardrock
The fuck you think I am, gay?
I ain't got no time to play I ain't got nuttin to say
Bounce out the crib, just to see my man 50
and what's up with B.I.G.
And the O.G.B., you know they keep plenty hookers
And I ain't a bad looker
So I see one ho that I like yeah, oooh
Shit is cool

(Trust no hoes, all they want is bankroll)

That's what I'm tryin to tell you now baby
My man 50 done schooled me to all y'all hookers
Knahmsayin? I ain't lame to this
Can't spell game without me, the B.I.G.</pre>
