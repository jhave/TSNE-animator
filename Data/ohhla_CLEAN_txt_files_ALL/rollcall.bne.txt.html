[Bizzy]
Roll call, roll call (Seven Sign)
Rap is back to its original force 

[Announcer]
Commander-in-Chief and the Mob Boss

[Bizzy] (Laughing...)
I've been waitin' to rock shit
Yea, yea, yea, yea (roll call)
You muthafuckas can't shut me up!
You muthafuckas can't stop me! (roll call)

[Announcer]
I present to you, our leader

[Bizzy]
Seven in Heaven, I love my bretheren, (?)
Ready? Come catch us
Hey, hey, hey

[Bizzy 1]
It's a war goin' on here in this Universe
Ha, ha. And I spoke my mind, and it liberated me
Rap is truly back to it's original force

[Bizzy 2]
The weeping widow and the abominations 
That is tatted on your forehead:
You will fall in the new born Babylon
Y'all don't feel me? 
Get on the muthafuckin' level! </pre>
