I was on the cover of Fortune but you know I ain't flossin
I need two armored cars for all the bread I'm tossin
I got a marble pool table, gold nine for the haters
Hustler and a player, got a mansion with elevator
We, ghetto millionaires, we shine like stars
and roll through the hood in the tightest of cars

[Jermaine Dupri]
Well to me a flooded Roley's like a Swatch watch
and a Lex is like a V-Dub, y'all niggaz can't keep up
Since day one I've been on burn
Had hits back when most of y'all was interns, huh
