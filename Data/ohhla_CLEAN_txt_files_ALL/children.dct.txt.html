Song:   Children Can Live (Without It)
Typed by: alcatrazz_iz_crazy_4_god@yahoo.com

I don't want another country, I want ta recognize intent
Of our forefathers when they wrote precisely what they meant
Taken on the form of christian, But the power is denied
In god we trust only when we lust for the apple of our eye
One nation under god with morals out of proportion
An end result is murder under legalized abortion

[Chorus]
Children can live without it
Who's gonna take it away?
Children can live without it
Maybe we'll learn someday
Oh, that we'll learn, I pray

A miracle of god, now looked on as a choice
It's time for all his children, to unify a voice
With influence in our numbers and power in out prayer
We must defend the children, And fight for what is fair
What appears to be an upset can change its ugly course
And we can do it all, Through jesus christ our lord

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
O, they can fight, but they cannot win
They can scream, but none will hear them
Don't ya know that our conscience will die
If we take away the freedom to survive?

[Chorus] - 3X</pre>
