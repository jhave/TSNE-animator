Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty-Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill

[Kev Tha Hustla]
So baby come fly wit a nigga who space surf
She know how to dive she don't jump it face first
I let her log on and play wit my laptop 
We so high up hands feelin the backdrop
I roll a bat she catch balls like a backstop
D-12 baby and ya man juss a matchbox
I get cash really honey this is me
I'm the drug she the plug, she in love with the d
Never give it to her raw, no cs like the weed
So don't be blind to the fact
Baby girl come and see, I get money wit an attitude that's mad cash
But when you walked passed, I was like damn!

She want me to give her my all
I'm talkin one night, no feelings involved
Early morn no passion, show her my flight school skills no crashin.

[Bridge]
Girl ya lovin got me gone, me gone, me gone
You're like a drug to me I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin

[Chorus]
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty-Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill

Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty-Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill

Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin)
Shawty-Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin)
Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin)
Shawty-Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin)

[Wiz Khalifa]
Okay!
Uh oh, ery'thing taylor'd
Ruin no neighbors, hop inside and we'll fly where a bird or plane is
Watcha name is, and who ya came wit
Listen, imma take you out and put you in that right position, no
And tell ya nigga I ain't trippin
Never fallin off, I ain't slackin on my pimpin
Niggas call me weirdo, bitches call me different
Send me naked pics when I'm on the road
Just to let you know, I think it's beautiful (beautiful)
Soon as I get home I'm rushin over like a head start
Fresh up out the shower to the sofa skip the bed part
I sharp shooter, young bret hart
Prolly would like ta, hollywood night cha
Red eye flight cha, somewhere near we can get lost and let chu pop off
Go

[Bridge]
Girl ya lovin got me gone, me gone, me gone
You're like a drug to me I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin

[Chorus]
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty-Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill

Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty-Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill

Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin)
Shawty-Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin)
Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin)
Shawty-Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin)</pre>
