[Intro - Plies]
Hey what's happ'nin' homie? This ya lil' whoa Plies man.. I ran across
a nice lil' baby the other day homie... Lil' mama so bad she had me
hypnotized cuzz... couldn't even get my eyes off her.. I'mma tell you 
how it feel to be hypnotized

[Chorus - Akon]
You got me so hypnotized, the way yo' body rollin' 'round and
Round, that booty keep bumpin', titties just bouncin', up and down
You got me so hypnotized, the way yo' body rollin' 'round and
Round, that booty keep bumpin', titties just bouncin', up and down

[Verse 1 - Plies]
It's two o'clock in the mo'nin', I'm 'gnaced up and I'm ho'ny
All I need now is some moanin', that pussy got me zonin'
Her vibe tell me she want it, she got to fuck how she on me
I got her now 'cause she jonin', I know in the panties she foamin'
I locked eyes on that monkey, I know she wet 'cause she told me
That ass on her she pokin', every nigga in here scopin'
I see me up in her pokin', she bent over and I'm strokin'
Her cheeks spread wide open, I'm beatin' it and I'm focused

[Chorus 2 - Akon]
You got me so hypnotized, the way yo' body rollin' 'round and
Round, that booty keep bumpin', titties just bouncin', up and down
You got me so hypnotized, the way yo' body rollin' 'round and
Round, that booty keep bumpin', titties just bouncin', up and down
(Now do it some mo') Just like that
(Just do it some mo') Yes just like that
(Girl do it some mo') Now shake that ass
And make a nigga like me spend that cash
(Now do it some mo') Just like that
(Just do it some mo') Yes just like that
(Girl do it some mo') Now shake that ass
And make a nigga like me spend that cash

[Verse 2 - Plies]
She bad as hell and she swole, I'm tryna play in her hole
Lil' mama a dime she cold, I fuck her once and she so'
I want her naked no clothes, I'm in the private show
No limit anything goes, I'mma let her ride me her toes
Just stand in front of me and pose, you touch mine I touch yours
To get her sprung is my goal, first time I seen her I froze
I had to get her she know, she bucked it then she fold
'Cause I'm too real and she knows, she want the goon and it shows

[Chorus 2 - Akon]
