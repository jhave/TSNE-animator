[Phonte as Percy Miracles]
Baby, we've been together for so long...
and I just don't know...why you continue to do me
the way you wanna do me?
I checked your cell phone, and I saw a number
I didn't notice he called on that...
So somethin' tells me, either yo' mama done change her number...
*inhales* or you CHEAT-IN' *exhales*

How could you do this to me after all these years?
Girl I don't know what in the fuck you think this is
Always tryna play around and tell lies while you are not at home
Sorry girl, you busted now, I saw the number on yo' cell phone, you cheatin'

[Chorus]
You was cheatin' (yes you was), caught you creepin' (yes I did)
To the window, to the wall, skeet-skeetin' (you triflin' hoe)
Heavy breathing, (yes you was) now I'm leavin'...
(I got to walk out right now, 'cause I just can't take it girl, you was cheatin')
You was cheatin' (yes you was), caught you creepin' (yes I did)
To the window, to the wall, skeet-skeetin' (you dirty bitch)
Heavy breathing (yes you was), now I'm leavin'...
(I got to get outta here, 'cause I just can't take it no more)

[Mr. Diggs - Ronald Isley impersonator]
La-laaah, Percy don't you know-ho...
we been through this type of thing before-hore

[Percy]
Oooooooh Lord,
But this time it's different, I know I ain't trippin
I looked in the cell phone, saw another man's digits

[Mr. Diggs]
Now, you must be trippin', 'cause you know it's not the same
She caught you from her mama house and maybe her number changed

[Percy]
No, she got the two-thousand minute plan, callin' her minuteman
I'm packin' the kids up, we gone in the minute babe (no don't do it Percy)

[Chorus - (Percy) [Mr. Diggs]]
You was cheatin' (yes you was), caught you creepin' (yes I did)
To the window, to the wall, [to the wall, oh you killing me] skeet-skeetin' (you cold busted)
Heavy breathing [No Percy] (out the door), now I'm leavin'... [No, no no..]
(No mo' checks and no mo' CHILD support) [Oh my gawd-hod, no]
You was cheatin' (Fuck that..), caught you creepin'
(I can't believe she would do this to me)
To the window, to the wall, skeet-skeetin' [Give it another chance, Percy]
Heavy breathing (She don't deserve it), now I'm leavin'... [no, no] (no, no, no she don't)
[Let me count the ways that I loved you girl]

[Background singers - Bridge]
I say, one, two, three, four, five
Really wanted you to be my wife
And I say six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Really wanted you to be my friend
And I say eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen
Can't, think of nothing that rhyme wit', fifteen

[Percy (Mr. Diggs)]
Ooooh Lord, the background singers just messed up
(Well, Percy I don't give a fuck)
Well, tell me where we gonna go
(We're going to "The Minstrel Shooooooooooow")

[Chorus]
You was cheatin' (yes she was), caught you creepin'
To the window, to the wall, skeet-skeetin'
(We're live at the show and I just DON'T know where to go, baby)
Heavy breathing, now I'm leavin'...
(Ooohh, I'm so hurt, I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so turned around and I just turn around of seein' faces
and then +I+ just wanna fall out and die...)
You was cheatin' [I know how you feel Percy], caught you creepin' (You don't understand)
To the window, to the wall, skeet-skeetin' [Believe me, I know how you FEEL-EEL]
Heavy breathing (How do you know?), now I'm leavin'...
[You know in your heart, that you, don't, want, nobody but, HERRRR]

Whoo! Thank you! (Thank you, thank you everyone)
