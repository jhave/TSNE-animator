Ain't about being a motherfucking pimp (uh)
Ain't about being a hustler (naah)
Player (naah)
Thief (naah)
It's about being a motherfucking king (aight)
Ya mean ?

Baby it's a king thing (yeah)
From Kayto to David (uh)
Two kings in the streets neither one made it (uh)
Think about shed a tear ? Niggah save it (what)
Dirty motherfucking games, both niggas played it (come on)
David went on some foul shit, went full throtle (throtle)
Smack shorty in the face with a glass bottle (bottle)
Killing bitches with battery acet (yeah)
That's the type of shit this nigga masterd (yeah)
David was a bastard (oke)
Step out the stunts with the slow walkin (urh)
Glide by leave you straight no talkin (urh)
It's about were ever I'm at, Knowing I got them (aight)
By the time a nigga thought about beating I shot 'em (pop pop)
See it takes a snake to spot a snake
And by the time they spot the snake
God shot the snake (uh)
I got to get what ever I can get my hands on
Fuck you niggas (what) is what I'ma stand on

It's a king thing, what goes around comes back around
It's a king thing, every part of town knows why your down
It's a king thing, got these new cats commin' up in the game
It's a king thing, and I'ma make sure niggas remember my name
For real

It ain't about talkin'the talk
Just walkin' the walk (uhhuh)
How many cats you don't cross from L.A. to NewYork (uhhuh)
Hit regardless for what when ever you hit town (aight)
You got real niggas respecting on how you get down
Ain't no motherfucking thing changed (whoo)
I'm still the grymiest nigga up in this game
What's my name (what)
King D-A-V-I-D
I'm like a bloodhound
Cuz it ain't nothin' but money hide it from me (uh)
And ain't nobody ridin' for free fuck that (what)
Excuse my back nigga, what black (yeah)
I go at niggas hard for a little bit of pay (uhhuh)
A couple of hondred dollars will get your ass dead
I'm not petty I stay hongry (oke)
And as long as shit is the way it is, then shit go stay ugly (oke)
Bitch, so bring home the drama (yeah)
Shit how petty niggas cross, I gotsta sleep with the armor (uh)

It's a king thing, what goes around comes back around
It's a king thing, every part of town knows why your down (uh)
It's a king thing, got these new cats commin' up in the game
It's a king thing, and I'ma make sure niggas remember my name
For real

But I'ma make sure niggas remember my name
For Real

It's a king thing (yeah), what goes around comes back around
It's a king thing, every part of town knows why your down (uh)

For real</pre>
