Verse 1:  Lord Tariq
Yo, low profile, I creeps like the phantom
Introduce you to the steps in my duplex
In the Hamptons where hit it harder is the anthem
With thoughts of crackin yo legs like plexiglass
I put my face between yo thighs with yo sexy ass
Have you grinnin with yo head spinnin
Like my B-B-Ss, and Im plannin to run in em if they carry big breastes
Wit more wood than the 98 Lexus G-Ss
And Im good at takin you shoppin and then poppin the question

Verse 2:  Peter Gunz
In the summer I like havin sex in the park
In the winter I love havin sex in my car
In the backseat of a taxi, put yo skirt on no panties
And Ill lick it like its taffy
If you ask me, Peter slides tongue through yo bushes
While you wishes
He was yours but hes not hes here for the night
Get it right
You call it anytime any place
Do you like it from the back, I like it in my face, tell me
