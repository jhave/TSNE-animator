[Jay-Z]
Geah.. yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
right next to DeNiro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere; yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, hola my Dominicanos (Dinero!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonalds
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State street
Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow but BK is from Texas
Me I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty-Ty, still sippin' mai-tais
Sittin' courtside Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga I be Spiked out, I can trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I most definitely from

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon) 
In New Yooooork (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made, ohhh
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New Yooooork (yeah, yeah, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York (uh) New York (yeah) New Yooooork (uh)

[Jay-Z]
Ay! Uh-huh, yeah!
Yeah! Uh-huh, uh-huh... new
C'mon! You're welcome, OG
I made you out, nigga

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed Blue, but I ain't a Crip, though
But I got a gang of niggas walking with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rocks
Afrika Bambaataa shit - home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
8 million stories out there in the Naked, City
It's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me I gotta plug Special Ed "I Got It Made"
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
3 dice Cee-lo, 3 card Marley
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World trade
Long live the king, yo, I'm from the Empire State, that's...

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Ayyy~! That boy good...
Welcome to the bright lights, baby...
Lights is blindin', girls need blinders
so they can step out of bounds quick; the side lines is 
lined with casualties, who sip the life casually
then gradually become worse; don't bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
And in the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with 'em
Mommy took a bus trip and now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
"Hail Mary" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feeling like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien
Ay, ay, ahhh

[Chorus]

[Alicia Keys]
One hand in the air for the big city (uh)
Street lights, big dreams all lookin' pretty (uh)
No place in the world that can compare (uh)
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say "yeeeeeah-ei-ee-yeeeeeah~!"
"Yeeeeeah-ei-ee-yeeeeeah~!"

[Chorus]</pre>
