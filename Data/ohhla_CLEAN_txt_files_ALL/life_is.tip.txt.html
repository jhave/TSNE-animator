[Norah Jones]
Life's filled with graaaay....
But now, it comes clean..
Leaves fall, awaaaaaay...
Hip-hop is playing again
And it's bangin, toooo....
Know it's bangin, for you...
Don't stop this feeling I feel...
I just wanna lay around all day
and feel the breeze upon my knees
I'm so INTO your rich history..
Tell me a story to taaaake me away..
Come and take meeeeee, ooooooh...
Come and take meeeeee with yooooou..

[Chorus 4X: Norah Jones]
Life is, better
Now that, now that I found you
Life is, better
Now that, now that I found you

[Q-Tip]
Uh, uh, one step at a time, a man walked on the moon
One record got played, Kool Herc said boom
One minute young man, your time come soon
We WAITING, it was prophetsized you loon
We bang our drums, enter message through sound
We wrasslers and we takin over your town
Hands sweatin, it's critiquing all this vibe I'm gettin
