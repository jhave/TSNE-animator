Thats right yall
I guess I should let yall know what bein an Ice Cream Man
is all about since its the Ice Cream Man theme song
But what I want yall to do for me is light ya
weed,lay back and we gon take a ride
A ride all the way through
Through the Ice Cream Mans whole life.

            Mo B. Dick:
Im sittin in a room full of hoes with some sexy ass bodies
Smokin on the cess,playin dominoes.Aint fuckin wit nobody
Im scopin em out without a doubt.I see big booties hangin out
My dick is gettin hard like its about to pop out of socket.
I cant believe what Im seein.
I must be straight (geein)
cause I got all these hoes in my pocket.
Im just a playa from around the way.
Im hustlin just to see another day.
Im just a playa from around the way.
Im hustlin just to see another day.
Playa haters gettin sick cause they cant get with my click
cause we took all their bitches
But the niggas know the deal cause we packin that steel
and dumpin mothafuckasin ditches
So hey, its another day for me to play
as I slang my yay and get paid off these smokers
You dont know the deal cause this thing is real
mothafuckas, I aint jokin, I aint jokin

            Master P:
Im on a porch with these killas.Must be a drug dealer
I run from the taz.Call me banana peeler
I got that HK cocked ready to block.
Aint no love on my block.Got this dope in my sock
My little brother hooked it up tryin to get big
In the ghetto I seen another man lose his wig
But I aint trippin off the dope-game
Im too deep in my hood slangin heroin and cocaine

            Silkk The Shocker:
Way too deep to turn back now.
My homies tryin to jack now
Put away the sack down.Now I gots my gat now
You bitches better raise up off the tip
of us playas tryin to strive and stay alive, Fuck the 9 to 5
Im all about the papers.Niggas tryin to chase the
million dollar spot with a glock and a caper

            Master P:
We some macks like Goldie.Yall cant hold me
Im Oulajawon dunkin on you and your homie
Cause we in this shit deep tryin to get mine
Fuck all that.Cuz,kick the fuckin chorus line

            Mo B. Dick:
Im just a playa from around the way
Im hustlin just to see another day

            Master P/(Silkk The Shocker):
[I love my mill].And if I die who gives a fuck?
Just another black gone
(Nobody gives a damn if you make it back home.)
Cause my auntie on dope
My little homies out there in the hood pushin hella coke
So I try to get fronted a bumper
I mean a fifty dollar dub on a come-up

            Silkk The Shocker:
Dope in my All Stars.Just got[bought] a sawed-off
Nigga wait for me to fall off but I wont get hauled off 
in a casket.Im all about blastin
Dope be the cabbage.You know that makes us savage

            Master P:
I guess that makes me a G
Cause I done flipped an half-an-ounce to a quarter key
On a come-up and bubblin up and doublin up 
and all these niggas jealous cause the P sellin quarters,bro
In the hood like Ice Cream
All yall niggas corner check me.I done killed em with the triple beam
And yall mad cause Im rich and famous
just like Amus,but still a gangsta
So call me a hustla
and if you a playa hater,nigga,then your namell be Mr. Busta
In No Limit,niggas dont like playa haters
We got them mothafuckin regulators
Nine millimeter fully strapped
Yo Cuz,bust motherfuckin caps

            Mo B. Dick:
Im just a playa from around the way
Im hustlin just to see another day
Master P and Silkk,they gettin paid
The No Limit soldiers,hey,they dont play
From New Orleans all the way to the Bay
The Ice Cream Man you know that he dont play
He dont play.He dont play</pre>
