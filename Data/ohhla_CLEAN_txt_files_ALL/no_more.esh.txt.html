[Esham]
What if... people... didn't die no more? You know?
What if we all could just live forever? You know? Imagine that

Imagine being able to live past twenty-one
No more ghettos, no more slums, everybody's young
Don't nobody pack a gun cause killers, it ain't none
We all one, and feeling your pain sons
Daughters, flap your wings, walk on water
I am the resurrection, and the life
Trials and tribulations got me speaking in this ill communication
Just a product of this wickedness created in this nation
But I was sworn from the cross, I was born to be a boss
How long will they mourn me when my life is lost?
Never mind that; What if you could rewind the time back?
Would you bring B-I-G or Martin Luther King back?
It's all about love and happiness, word to Al Green
I mean that as I lean back in a clean 'Lac
Thinking about never dying
So Detroit like the lions, flap my wings and keep flying

[Chorus]
What if people didn't die no more?
What if mothers didn't cry no more?
No reason for me to get high no more
No reason for me to say goodbye no more
Then you could be forever mine, me amore
What if people didn't die no more?
What if mothers didn't cry no more?
No reason for me to get high no more
No reason for me to say goodbye no more
Then you could be forever mine, me amore

[Esham]
I know everybody die, but what if people didn't die?
And the sky was a place where you could just fly?
Is it nine-one-one or nine-eleven?
2Pac can you tell me if there's thugs in Heaven?
And a one-eighty-seven is a thing of the past
Shotguns dont blast, theres no aftermath
Theres no need for bail, theres no need for jail
This could be your Heaven, theres no need for Hell
There's no more babies dyin', there's no more mothers cryin'
Trying to put together your skull from slugs flyin'
Imagine a world with no war and no crime
No more niggaz doing time, no more going out your mind
No more runnin from the cops, no more standing on the block
No more going to sleep at night from the sounds of gunshots
No more strain on the brain from the pain of the game
I was thinking to myself while I was walkin in the rain

[Chorus]

[Esham]
Everytime I look up at the sky
I think what if people didn't die and we live forever high
Everytime I look up at the sky
I think what if people didn't die and we live forever high</pre>
