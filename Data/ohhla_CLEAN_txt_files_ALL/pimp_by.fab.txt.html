[Fabolous]
His daddy kept it pimpin, mami was his bottom bitch
She came back with me, I'm the one who got him rich
I'm the sperm from his sac, been confirmed from a mack
Got that good wavy shit like it's permed from the back
Gettin sick behind a desk, poppa earned from a 'llac
Slap it like a tennis player, hand turned from the back
I'm 'bout my business player, I return from the track
No Sesame Street, I just learned from "The Mack"
I don't know Bert, never met Ernie either
But I can turn a diva when a player turn and leave her
Big Bird or The Count, they ain't teach me
the big words I pronounce, it was listenin to Goldie
Ridin with my father while he listenin to oldies
He turned the music down, and this is what he told me
I'ma put you on the game to make it while on the surf
If it's worth it then you take and take it for what it's worth
