[Hook]
You bootin up, you bootin up nigga, you bootin up, ha
You bootin up, you bootin up nigga, you bootin up
I'll make it happen to ya, I ain't rappin to ya
I'll make it happen to ya, I ain't rappin to ya
I'll make it happen to ya, I ain't rappin to ya
I'll make it happen to ya, I ain't rappin to ya

[Soulja Slim]
Soulja, soulja tell me how you do it
First you need Dani for some cut throat music
I'ma give you the game nigga peep this out
Just put ya mask on ya face just let 'em see ya mouth
This original, down south bounce shit
Gotta give it up to ???? who invented the shit
Rest in peace to DJ Irve you had them trigga mans locked
I was to young to go and ghost so I was standin outside
That was way back then, when I was sellin rocks
Bounce was the shit then niggaz gave me my props
I'ma six court nigga, Magnolia nigga
They beefin on LaSelle and they beefin on Willow mayne
Fuck them niggaz, they ain't talkin bout nothin
They don't feel how I feel bout my projects, they stuntin
I aim it at ya head and let this bitch off
Juvenile is my dawg and thats how we set it off

[Bridge:Soulja Slim (Juvenile)]X4
Whodi (Wassup)
I got a k' (Wassup)
And I don't play (Wassup)
yea

[Juvenile]
I ain't too fine in fuckin wit niggaz, cuz most of them hoes
They get exposed, clipped and flipped in the road
burn him and his car and his clothes
Know some killas that'll provide me with help
But thats not really necessary, Juve wilin' hisself
So where ya going, wassup, hope it ain't outside son
Look I don't jot a foot in the club without my gun
I'ma boss wit these hoes, niggaz can stop my fun
Cheezy, this gon run and go tell the cops what I done
If I don't like ya, I'll fight ya, I'll cut ya
I'll kill ya, in fact, I'll show ya hoes how a guerilla could act
Me, Slim and Wack carry the hood on our back ya understand me
I do this for love my area my family
I'll kill ya mami, is ya speakin my spanish
Kidnap her ass from Tammies, you cry and she vanish
Asked my guy get out the jammies, Big Boy been nannies
Even when my daddy went frantic, I still wouldnt panic

[Hook]

[Soulja Slim]
I heard Crazy wan' kill me, and Silk want fight
But I've been doin that duck type shit all my life
No, I don't know karate, herb and some silky draws
You located in Victoria Secret full of bras
You don't want none of me, keep it in the studio
Take it to the streets and I'ma really prove that you's a hoe
I wasnt gon' fuck wit ya on the strength C (C-Murder)
But now I'ma fuck over ya on the strength of P (Master P)
I been ready to die, you ain't ready to die
I got shot when I was 17 now I'm 25
I don't give a fuck nigga, I don't give a fuck nigga
I don't give a fuck nigga, I don't give a fuck nigga
I'ma soulja and yall fake niggaz
Cuz I'ma soulja and yall fake niggaz
Cuz I'ma real soulja and yall fake niggaz
Cuz I'ma soulja and yall fake niggaz

[Juvenile]
I'll make it happen to ya, I ain't rappin to ya
I'll make it happen to ya, I ain't rappin to ya
I'll make it happen to ya, I ain't rappin to ya
I'll make it happen to ya, I ain't rappin to ya
I'll make it happen to ya, I ain't rappin to ya
I'll make it happen to ya, I ain't rappin to ya
I'll make it happen to ya, I ain't rappin to ya
I'll make it happen to ya, I ain't rappin to ya</pre>
