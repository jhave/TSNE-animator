[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Ol' Dirty kickin' your ass
The things that you learnt in class, is trash
You can't do nothing with it, I put you in the past
The pilgrim muthafuckas -- shut the fuck up!
I do it to you bad luck, the hair get plucked
The only thing on your brain is to give me this cash
And stay out of business, cuz I'm takin' your cash
This world belong to me, none of y'all free
I got y'all in -- slavery
The habit of breathing, the hope to find
That you're misbehaving, Link your Cuban
Fuck your booing, flash the burners
On your crewing, cuz I'm much different from
The other M.C.'s, I got the amazing ability
I get on the mic, so you can have a ball (break that break)
I can fly through the air and stick to the wall
I can take a punch, or get hit by a car
Could go to the nearest or farthest star
As a matter of fact, that's what I won't talk about
How I'm going outer space, just to be in the house
How I'm going outer space, ---- -- be in the house

[Chorus 7X: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Break that break (nah-nah-nah-nah)

[U-God]
I'm that mic enhancer, the beat programmer
When Ason Unique speak, he throw hammers
And we go bananas over old school breaks
I take an old school loop and break it on yo face
I start from a clean slate, bang you on the waistline
Deep Space Nine, mass master bass line
I break spines, til they fraction or splinter
I want Michael Jackson money, just a fraction of Thriller
Deep in, the laboratory, manufacture the Zilla
Cock, notch category, capture the realer
We the ex-drug dealers, still serving them fiends
With TV's in the car, the size of movie screens
You know the routine, give 'em what they need
That disco shit, satisfaction guaranteed

[Chorus 7X]

[Masta Killa]
Yeah, 1-2-3, microphone check
In the place to be, as you can see
This is Wu-Tang Clan guest starring M.C
With no harm intended, nobody offended
Carry on with the social, nothing but a party tonight
Special invite, ladies free before midnight
We lock the club down, clash sound hear the guns pop
See D.J.'s spin, counter clock, keep gridlocked
Line around the block, women by the flock
Wanna party with the great, I reap Jamel
Ring bells throughout the state
Diggin' in the crates, for the old school
Remix, nice it up for the people
Ladies want the hardest stiff, to spread eagle

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
