It was like March or April, fuckin' Libra...fuckin', um, shit...

(1st Verse-Violent J)
Taurus, born in 1775
I'm like 300 and something, but I'm still alive
I used to hang with the original Billy The Kid
You prob'ly think I'm only playing but, I did
My daddies were a two headed freak show
Momma, a fortune teller, Esmarelda Zella
Anyway they had sex on a ouiji board 
and I was born the next day...Violent J
When I was 14, I tripped on the train track
And I was crushed right there on the steel rack
I'm out cold, they thought it had fucked me up
I got up and itched my butt, I'm like, "what?"
Everybody tripped and called me the clown devil boy
Child of the witch heffer...whatever
Tied me up, burned me and threw stones
Had a few scrapes and cuts, smokey nuts
After that they started bowing and shit
Praying at me, you know how them gremlings get
I said, "Get off my dick, I ain't a savior,
I'm what you call a juggalo and all I want is my flavor
Four simple things in this bitch, before I die...

(Shaggy2Dope)
I WANT A RUSTY AXE
I WANNA KNOW VOODOO
A FAT BITCH NAMED BRIDGETT
And a little sip of Faygo, too
'TILL I GET MY SHIT, IN THIS MOTHERFUCKER I WON'T NEVER DIIIIEEE!

(2nd Verse- Violent J)
So anyway...
50 years pass, all my homies are old ass fucks
I ain't even got hair on my nuts
I left the village in search of my ends
I wrestled alligators, battled terminators
Nothing ever killed me, nothing could harm me
I fought in the Civil War, Yankees army
I walked across enemy lines with a mack-10
(Shaggy2Dope) 
Man, they didn't even have that shit back then
(Violent J) 
How you just gonna come in my shit and fuck it up?
(Shaggy2Dope) 
Well at least make this shit sound real, man, damn!
(Violent J)
I walked across enemy lines with a...lantern
Steady taking cannon balls, to the balls
The war ended, I traveled the country horseback
Until this fool tried to horsejack
He put his gat to my head and blew my face up
[powww] It didn't even smear the make-up
I took his gun and put a tivet in his neck
Sheriff didn't like it...I got indicted
87 long years in the state pen
Until they finally forgot why they put me in
They had to let me go you know they had nothing
On the way out they're like, "Yo, ain't you like 100 and something?"
I said, "That's right, and I ain't gonna die, 
'TILL I GET MY SHIT, MOTHERFUCKER!"

(Shaggy2Dope)
I WANT A RUSTY AXE
I WANNA KNOW VOODOO
A FAT BITCH NAMED BRIDGETT
And just a little sip or two...
'TILL I GET MY SHIT, IN THIS MOTHERFUCKER I WON'T NEVER DIIIIEEE!

(3rd Verse- Violent J)
I slept under bridges, lived in the valleys
Climbed the mountains, searched the alleys
More years passed, and I still ain't died
Now I'm in Detroit on the Southwest Side
My homie has an Impala, blue '67
Last night we hit the road pushing 111
I stuck my head out the window, told him floor up the most
And let my nugget ping off a light post
Ha ha ha! I really did, 'cuz
Hurts a little bit, but then you get a straight buzz
The world hates me 'cuz of shit like this
They always try to kill me but MIIIIIISSSS
I know it's odd that my face is forever painted
When I was born, the bitch-ass doctor fainted
My toungue's a little long, I choke people with it
Looks kinda nasty...but chicks dig it
And I told ya my neck can stretch for miles
I look like something from 'The X-Files'
People wanna see me die more than a little bit
But I'm a juggalo, and as a juggalo I want my SHIT!
AND I AIN'T GONNA DIE, TILL I GET IT!

I said Faygo.  FUCK Mountain Dew.
'TILL I GET MY SHIT, IN THIS MOTHERFUCKER I WON'T NEVER DIIIIEEE!
DIIIIEEE!
