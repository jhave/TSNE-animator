[Snoop Dogg]
Man, you got me goin crazy baby
Feel like I'm losin my mind

[Chorus: Soopafly]
Feels like I'm losin control, and I don't even know
Girl you hurt me oh so bad cause I love you so, hey
But it don't matter now, I'm doin better now
Whatever you do, bitch, will come back to you, bitch
Heeeeeeey, hey; heeeeeeey, hey
Heeeeeeeeeeeey, hey; heeeeeeey, hey

(Soopafly * overlapping chorus)
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
Now who would ever think that I wanted a home
Three kids and a wife, never be alone
A dog in the front yard and that picket fence
Havin somethin on the side?  It didn't make sense

(Butch) I'm a family man sportin a weddin band

(Soopafly)
I heard them niggas on your pager didn't give a damn
I gave you eighty percent of all my trust in you
The other twenty was cool, cause we gon' make it through

(Butch) The homies said she got my mind blew in, blew in

(Soopafly)
I told that nigga like Chris Tucker, 
"Don't worry about what the FUCK I be doin'"
We was makin chemistry, but who is he?
And how dis nigga know the deal about you and me?

(Butch) I fell to my knees and asked the girl "Why?"

(Soopafly)
She looked at my eyes with no reply
So I cried, I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes

[Chorus]

(Snoop Dogg * overlapping chorus)
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
I was in love at times
They say "Game Don't Wait" huh Warren G?
Well the game better wait for me
I'm spendin my time while I'm writin these rhymes
In the Hills for real, sippin wines, girl you'se a dime
Got me losin my mind
Well if lovin you is a crime
I'm down to do my time
Lock me up and throw away the key
I once told that "This was the way love was meant to be"
I see you with me forever
We can do things that you never, thought you coulda
Up out the hood-uh, is where I took you, never overlooked you
I can't believe that you shook to another spot
And left me cold, now I'm hot
I'm tryin to find you, what am I to do?
I gave you everything that you needed

[Chorus]

(Snoop * over chorus)
Took it for granted, shit, I'm cool now
What goes around, comes around

[Snoop] I was in love at times
[Soopa] I was in love at times
[Snoop] I was in love at times
[Soopa] I was in love at times

(Snoop Dogg)
You know what girl I mean..
I was in love with you and you did me like that
But you know what they say?
What goes around comes around

(Butch Cassidy)
How could, how could, you do me wrong?
You be messin up my songs (my songs)
Now a nigga must move on (I gave you)
Gave love, and you just, straight played on me (on me)
Had a nigga sick for weeks (for weeks)
Now I must begin my streak (I was in love at times..)
