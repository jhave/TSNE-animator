[Violent J]
Dog, you're gonna get fuckin' busted
She'll break out with DNA on that ass
She'll fuckin' use forensic science
Whatever it takes, you aint' getting away with it
You're gonna get fuckin' busted, I'm fuckin' telling ya

[Syn]
Only sixteen, a hottie across the street
Washing her daddy's car, she was toying with me
She came inside and promised wouldn't take long
She's about to swallow when my lady came home and caught me

[Syn]
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
She was bitchin' mad out of control, like Hiroshima
I thought the bitch was gonna explode, like Hiroshima

[Syn]
I never smoke, my woman hates it, it's wrong
But this ganja, Mike Peezy had, it just smelt so strong
Roll it up, fuck it, I puffed it and passed
Not knowing my woman was standing right behind my ass
ng right behind my ass, oh lord

[Syn]
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
The bitch was stompin', shakin' the flo', like Hiroshima
I swear to God I couldn't take it no mo', like Hiroshima

[Syn] (Violent J)
I love this woman just as much as one can
Some things I do, she will never understand
I love Dark Lotus, and she loves The Cure
I love my wrestling, and she says it's absurd (she don't like The Rock)
She disses my style (your style), she disses my rap (say what)
She makes my dick hard when she sits on my lap (oh)
If she dissed my homies, I guarantee you some drama
I'll pack that bitch's shit up, send her back to her mama
(send her back to her mama, like Hiroshima)

[Syn]
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima

[Syn]
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima</pre>
