[Lloyd Banks]
I'm Back, Nigga

[Chorus- Lloyd Banks]
I'm a G-Unit nigga and that means I don't play by the rules
But I could make you move
Buy a quarter mil on jewels so I ride around wit the ooze
And that'll make 'em move
Ma, is you staying or coming? Make up your mind
My lifestyles to fast to take my time
I got to get in position to make her mind
Cause I ain't leaving the  club with out my nine
You know I got my nine
Think twice 'fore you cross that line
You must've lost your mind
Thinking you can off my shine

[Verse- Lloyd Banks]
Shorty got it shaking, I'm waiting to take her home
Its hot as hell in here and I'm thinking of patron
I know a couple different ways I can make her moan
When I'm done wit her, she'll want to take a nigga to Rome
Give me a hour, I'll have her blowing up my phone
Like a stem to a stone and she wont leave me alone
Million dollar nigga, I get it and show off
Hit the dolga give me a minute wit your boss
I'll fold you, New York fitted and gold cross
To the Rover, holster, over the shoulder
I'm the sickest thing spitting in a while
Your plane ain't the same, Its different when I fly
South side playa, play around and get popped
24-hour stake out on your nigga block
Don't get your views confused wit hip hop
'Fore you wind up on the news, now watch the hook drop

[Chorus- Lloyd Banks]
I'm a G-Unit nigga and that means I don't play by the rules
But I could make you move
Buy a quarter mil on jewels so I ride around wit the ooze
And that'll make 'em move
Ma, is you staying or coming? Make up your mind
My lifestyles to fast to take my time
I got to get in position to make her mind
Cause I ain't leaving the club with out my nine
You know I got my nine
Think twice 'fore you cross that line
You must've lost your mind
Thinking you can off my shine

[Verse 2- Lloyd Banks]
Yea, From what I hear, niggaz don't like me
Its funny, they want to be just like me
They bummy, its jealousy more than likely
The money, done made a nigga all icey
4 figure ring, that boy doing his thing
VVS bling, my chain long as a swing
Boulevard King, But known in Beijing
Fully prepared for whatever the drama may bring
69 scrapper wit the up and down pumps
Murder is forever, don't fuck around once
Bottle after bottle, I down 'em until I'm drunk
If you ain't chipped in, don't come round my blunt
Grimy and gritty, New York City's top gun
First nigga act up, gets a hot one
BPV, the bottom to top dun
I get there, I gets it, I'm done, one

[Chorus- Lloyd Banks]
I'm a G-Unit nigga and that means I don't play by the rules
But I could make you move
Buy a quarter mil on jewels so I ride around wit the ooze
And that'll make 'em move
Ma, is you staying or coming? Make up your mind
My lifestyles to fast to take my time
I got to get in position to make her mind
Cause I ain't leaving the  club with out my nine
You know I got my nine
Think twice 'fore you cross that line
You must've lost your mind
Thinking you can off my shine

[Verse 3- Lloyd Banks]
I don't know bout you, but I'm doing it for the Q (Queens)
Wood brand new, size 22 shoe
Use your money, don't let your money use you
I got crews view, you know the usual
My life's beautiful, my pockets full of bread
Get out of pocket, I'll play soccer wit your head
And that girl ain't your girl, know the difference BOY (Boy)
Pussy kill more niggaz than a liquor store
I left something on her when I seen her
She was rubbing it in like Noxzema
She real cute, big titties and hips and she pretty convincing
A video vixen
If you looking for a mack, I fit the description
Chicks see him, take pictures, and kiss him
Back block nigga, I get it and I'm good
I'm hood, living life like you should

[Chorus- Lloyd Banks]
I'm a G-Unit nigga and that means I don't play by the rules
But I could make you move
Buy a quarter mil on jewels so I ride around wit the ooze
And that'll make 'em move
Ma, is you staying or coming? Make up your mind
My lifestyles to fast to take my time
I got to get in position to make her mind
Cause I ain't leaving the  club with out my nine
You know I got my nine
Think twice 'fore you cross that line
You must've lost your mind
Thinking you can off my shine


N.Y, New York That Is
Y'all Know the name
I handle my biz, KID</pre>
