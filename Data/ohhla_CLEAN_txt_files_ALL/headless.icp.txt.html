Headless Boogie

[Violent J]
It's Friday night, dark, scary
Lonely, walking through the park, cemetery
And its foggy, cold and smoggy
Hear a dog, a howling doggy
I'm scared, should of brung the shotgun
Should of, would of, but I ain't got one
So I watch my back, and what's that
The caretaker, a dirty old hunchback
Better run, hide, quick, fast
He's coming for my ass with a shovel
No where to run, nore to hide but the grave bit
So I dove in, I did the dumb shit
Took a fall, deeper than six foot
Down the stairs, hit a floor and through a door
Into a whole new world of stiffs
Bodies, heads, and sexy little dead chicks
Club lights, sounds, bass
DJs spinnin with maggots on they face
And what I saw next then really took me
Uh, they did the headless boogie

[Chorus (2x)]
Hey yo, I heard that you died
Fuck that, it's time to get live
Dead bodies let's all take a ride
Lean to the left and slide (the headless boogie)

"Oh yeah, we dug up the finest 
Bitches in the graveyard
So come on down
And if you ain't come to get your funk out
Then get the fuck out, bitch"

[Violent J]
They all stand straight and swing to the side
No heads, but they feet still glide
Take a step back, twist and dive
I even seen Kurt Cobain get live (blam!)
No heads, but they all funky
And drunk, drinking old Spunky
Don't be shy, everyone's able
Hit the floor, leave your nugget on the table
And kick-step, and when you do kicks off
If you're dead, your legs might fall off
The whole time I can't believe
I can't conceive, I don't wanna leave
I'm kicking into a freak with no head
No face, but the rest is straight
She's with it, I hit it like a G
Her back fell off, eww, excuse me
Zombies, mummies, and Frankenstein
Drinkin 'cisco disco dead wine
Dead stiffs coming through the door
Head, speakers, and limbs on the floor
I'm getting drunk, I wanna be down, what's up
I wanna be the headless clown
They pulled out the jigsaw and got raw
And that ended it all, I did the headless boogie 

[Chorus (2x)]

"Hey yo, fuck that voodoo moshing, bitch
You come and freak it with the real dead juggalos
So come on by and we'll cut your nugget off
So you get grave dancing!!!"

[Chorus (4x)]
