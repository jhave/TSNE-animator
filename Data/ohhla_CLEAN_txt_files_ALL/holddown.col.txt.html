Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
If my heart stop pumping tomorrow don't feel no sorrow
'Cause life is hard mentally
And everything is meant to be
Sometimes I ask myself if I was gone who would remember me?
It's hard to tell
Oh well, sit back and sip this Hennessey
Now lately it's been hard to tell my friends part from my enemies
'Cause plenty niggaz show me love but in their hearts they envy me
Why?
I'm just a nigga from around the way
Told my mama I'd make it happen and I found a way
Pour out some liquor for my niggaz at the crossroads
And may the Lord give guidance to the lost souls
I know that deep inside these niggaz know there's more to life
Than macking hoes and stacking dough
Man I'm sorta like a nigga who done seen greener grass
So when they think they balling like the dream team
My nigga I done seen meaner cash
And I'm trying to get
Follow me nigga I'm on the prowl
Headed to the top
You watching me nigga?
Then hold it down

[Chorus]
Hold it down
If you need to holla at me don't hesitate to call
It ain't a problem
I can be there
I ride for
Lie for you
I know you'd do the same
I would die for you
So hold me down
When the times is hard I'll be around
So hold it down
And it don't matter how far
I'll be around
(I hold it down)

[Verse 2]
You was my nigga from the younger days
We grew up
I went to school, you went the other way
But still my brother man
I'm sitting reminiscing on
All of them bitches we was tripping over, kissing on
Or at the skating rink
We trying to bag some new hoes
And if I needed gear you'd let me hold your new clothes
And vice-a-versa man
But now that life is worser man
A nigga slow caking
I'm broke trying to chase a dream
You just got probation
And I'm stressed
Your little sister pregnant
What's next?
Oh shit, my mama doing drugs
At times it's hard to feel blessed
In this madness
I holla at my nigga in the sadness
Remember when your mama tried to beat you with that bat?
Shit, remember your chick Nina?
Man that ass was the fattest
Remember my crush on Sabrina?
Yo she's still the baddest
I'm just glad that I can holla at you
It's been a while
Until the next time I hear from you
Aye, hold it down

[Chorus]
Hold it down
If you need to holla at me don't hesitate to call
It ain't a problem
I can be there
I ride for
Lie for you
I know you'd do the same
I would die for you
So hold it down
When the times is hard I'll be around
So hold me down
And it don't matter how far
I'll be around
(I hold it down)

[Verse 3]
These is tough times baby
But we'll make it through
You know I'm headed for the top
I swear I'm taking you
Just hold a nigga down through this bad weather
The rain falling
Ain't balling but I have better
A woman with an ass and a strong mind
It's been a long time
Sometimes you on your bullshit
Sometime I'm on mine
Will I have a hard time to stay committed?
Or do I only want your voice moaning when I hit it?
Man only God knows
I know deep in your heart you don't want me to be no star though
There's groupies after every show
You scared I'm fucking every hoe
And girl I ain't 'gon lie and say I won't
'Cause shit you never know
But may the Lord give me strength
I love you more than anything
The future mother of my kids
The love is real
And if we ever part, God forbid
I love you still
So when I'm on the road don't trip
You know I'm down for you
Keep it tight and don't slip
And hold it down for me

[Chorus]
Hold it down
If you need to holla at me don't hesitate to call
It ain't a problem
I can be there
I ride for
Lie for you
I know you'd do the same
I would die for you
And hold me down
When the times is hard I'll be around
So hold me down
And it don't matter how far
I'll be around
(I hold it down) [x3]</pre>
