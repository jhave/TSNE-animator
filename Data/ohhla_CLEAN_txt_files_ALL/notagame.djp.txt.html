[Intro: DJ Premier]
Welcome, to another exciting evening, in the world of sports
Please not that when it comes to competition, there's one thing you must know

[Chorus: "Sample from Allen Iverson's press conference about practice"]
Not a game-not a-not a-not a game
Not a game-not a game-not a-not a-not a game
Not a game-not a game-not a-not a-not a game
Not a game-not a game......

[Verse One: Nick Javas] ("Sample from Allen Iverson's press conference about practice")
Man it's a sport!!! (Not a game) But we still label it as such
I feel like we playin too much
Man you should have stayed on the bus or up in the stand with all the fans
And them number one foam hands
You ain't feelin up a stat sheet 
Claimin you runnin game like back sweeps and track meets
And when the track meets the vocab I won't lag
So athletic like Deion and Bo Jack, son armed!!!
Puttin these words together like a run on
Fuck a period I need a lyricist since Pun's gone
Been stressed since BIG left
L fell, Pac's tick tock stopped, what happened to hip hop?!
King James of the game I got next
I get better everyday but I'm already the best
Yes, I, said it but only 'cause I meant it
Let it marinate until the next rap debate, 'cause this is........

[Chorus: "Sample from Allen Iverson's press conference about practice"](DJ Premier Scratchin)
Not a game-not a-not a-not a game
Not a game-not a game-not a-not a-not a game
(We-We-We don't play when it's time to slay-"Erick Sermon")
(Think it's a game!!!) Not a-not a-not a game
Not a game-not a-not a-not a game
Not a game-not a game-not a-not a-not a game
(We-We-We don't play when it's time to slay-"Erick Sermon")
(Think it's a game!!!) Not a game............

[Verse Two: Nick Javas]
In the words of Big Pop!!!!
Either you slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot
And when you trapped on the corner you think about the past
But you can't!!! 'Cause everything is movin so fast
Can't ball unless you handle the pill, or the rocks
And you drop dimes helpin these fiends score at will
Somebody gets killed for not coverin the spread
Ill advised shots instead leather is lead
Funny how hustlin is sort of like a sport
It starts out in the street, ends up in the court
And then your in the press, with no timeouts
Just time in with a number on your chest
Orange uniform like your playin with Syracuse
D's so aggressive they refuse to let 'em loose
Freedom stole it away so you pray
For a one on one, a year and a day 'cause this is.....

[Chorus: "Sample from Allen Iverson's press conference about practice"](DJ Premier Scratchin)
Not a game-not a-not a-not a game
Not a game-not a game-not a-not a-not a game
(We-We-We don't play when it's time to slay-"Erick Sermon")
(Think it's a game!!!) Not a-not a-not a game
Not a game-not a-not a-not a game
Not a game-not a game-not a-not a-not a game
(We-We-We don't play when it's time to slay-"Erick Sermon")
(Think it's a-a-a game!!!) Not a game............

[Verse Three: Nick Javas]
A!!!! I!!!! Probably the best you never heard about
I am the goat, however never burn out
No disrespect to Mr. Manigault
You see his, shot was on but his plan was off
It takes more than just talent, so now the only Earl we know
Well that would be The Pearl Monroe
And he sort of like me!!! A legendary Knick
But they called him Black Jesus I am the rap Jesus
Not sayin I'm God I'm just a man
A carpenter, usin his hands to built a brand
Nick Javas from emcee to empire
Usin positive thinkin to get inspired
Never expired, timeless, classic
Never forced my shot I find it I pass it
I've been boxed out beat to the ground
But I'm still all net, no need to rebound

[Chorus: "Sample from Allen Iverson's press conference about practice"](DJ Premier Scratchin)
Not a game-not a-not a-not a game
Not a game-not a game-not a-not a-not a game
(We-We-We don't play when it's time to slay-"Erick Sermon")
(Think it's a game!!!) Not a-not a-not a game
Not a game-not a-not a-not a game
Not a game-not a-not a game-not a-not a game
(We-We-We don't play when it's time to slay-"Erick Sermon")
(Think it's-Think it's a-a game!!!) Not a game............

[Outro: "Sample from Allen Iverson's press conference about practice"]
Not a, not a, not the game that I, go out there, and die for
Play every game like it's my last, not the game
Not a game, not a game...............</pre>
