Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro - spoken]
Yup yup, yup. How ya doin' today? Lemme crank you up a lil' bit
Chevy, I love you baby. Let's ride around today. How do you feel?
I feel good too. Let's ride around and see if we can't pick up...you know...Catfish

[Verse 1]
Look I don't really know, how you feel about steppin' in to my car to roll
How do you feel about lettin' me drop this money roll on ya?
But I don't do that dough, maybe meet me halfway baby
if you're really (gonna) cut, (gonna) what (gonna) take me down the road
experience something new that I've never seen before
Give me a song to sing to. You could be the one to hold my secrets
Girl my lips are closed (I need it)
You (peep it) I (believe it) cars (clean) and so (come see this)

[Chorus]
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
and I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
This whip is built for Queens and you wanna be seen witta King
well I wanna see the back of your jeans in seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
Tilted off Jim Bean, sittin low to the side I lean
and I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
well I wanna see the back of your jeans in seats (MY BOX CHEVY)

[Verse 2]
You know I like the way you look when you get a wax down
You sparkle in the street like, when we pass by rollin' around town
Your spokes are beautiful too, how many of those do you got on you?
Original hubcaps shine naturally got swagger
And true, you used to be in the junkyard, sittin' by your lonesome
till I got up in you once and changed you up now everybody hollerin' "I want some!"
But I ain't one to share, I don't mind if you crowd around and stare
Custom will get you cut from the women that's on the prowl for a car that's rare

[Chorus]
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
and I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
This whip is built for Queens and you wanna be seen witta King
well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
Tilted off Jim Bean, sittin' low to the side I lean
and I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in seats (MY BOX CHEVY)

[Outro with engine noises]
So you had a good day, huh? I know, I know. Me too
We really did our thing. We really did our thing tonight, Chevy
That's right. You love me? Shit, I love you too, chill out
I might have to put you in park. You buggin'
You wanna go back out? Yo man, my lil' buddy. My lil' Chevy!
You my lil' buddy? Yeah...Chevy box. Ya already know...Yelawolf, Catfish Billy...my Box Chevy
Off the top. Love your car...love my car. Yep, yep...my Box Chevy...
You got anything you wanna say Chevy?</pre>
