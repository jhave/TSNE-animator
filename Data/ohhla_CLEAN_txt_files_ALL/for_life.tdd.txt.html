Chorus:

I'll be yo' thug for life, my love will drive you crazy
You know nobody ain't gone (fuck) you like you need baby
Let's slip and slide together and go get this cheese baby
Hold me close and always be yo' thug for life
Keep it tight and always be yo' thug for life
Speak the truth and always be yo' thug for life
Break the bread and always be yo' thug for life

Verse 1: Kase

No, no, can't nobody get deep in the stomach like I do
And on top of that get 'cha high to
A nigga know that you liable
Jumping out a chevy on sky blue
Lot a nigga try to
Getting ready to kick it for me
To picky for me
Nigga's to sticky for me, stickin' with me
You got some nerve, you must think you pot superb
Nigga first tried to hide it, you shot the bird
K-Dog without a mouth full of filthy shit
Mouthing off nigga you would have been killed me bitch
Don't do shit but want a hundred dollar hair do
Come here, something I wanna tell you, what

Verse 2: Mystic

Don't, don't I have a heavy levi that a slide in dunk,
never find in the trunk
Where the weed at in the spot with the lump
I can't help but want to rub on them thighs and the hump
Shot her down in the zone, my love got 'cha high and it's on
I want leave ya' down alone or crying on the phone
Cause if ya' fed up then grab the chrome
Burning ya' home
I can't take it no mo' tell me what turns you on
Quick to yo' home, (???) (???)  baby hold me tight


Chorus:

I'll be yo' thug for life, my love will drive you crazy
You know nobody ain't gone (fuck) you like you need baby
Let's slip and slide together and go get this cheese baby
Hold me close and always be yo' thug for life
Keep it tight and always be yo' thug for life
Speak the truth and always be yo' thug for life
Break the bread and always be yo' thug for life

Verse 3: Trick Daddy

Really will ya' roll with a thug
A young nigga in a big car, with a big gun,
ridin' round sittin' on dubs
Smoking on a fat blunt, baby was up
I heard you was lost in love and I don't see ya' much
But I know you done lost ya' touch
Ever need a paper stake
Ever wanna get away just call me up
Yeah, hit me on my 984-4040
Yeap, you know the rest
You know right where to go,
right where to come when you want the best
And I'm on this thug shit
Making money and drug shit
And I ain't with that bullshit
Cause got damn it I love this

You and me baby can get a little close and stop before your heat baby
Let me drop dem' draws and give you some of this weed baby
I really love the way you touch and suck on me baby
And the way you look when you run up in that 380
But do them haters they acting real shady
Broke or rich you still gone be with me baby
Break a nigga off bread when I need some cheese baby
Tell them niggaz I'm gone be yo' thug for life, my love will drive you crazy
You know nobody ain't gone (fuck) you like you need baby
Let's slip and slide together and go get this cheese baby
Hold me close and always be yo' thug for life
Keep it tight and always be yo' thug for life
Speak the truth and always be yo' thug for life
Break the bread and always be yo' thug for life</pre>
