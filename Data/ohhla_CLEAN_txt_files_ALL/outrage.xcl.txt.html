OUTRAGE!!

[Brother J]
Blood to the concrete, tears to soil
And here's another word to make the other man foil
War, raised on your planet to a caveboy oppressor
Great one sends the aggressors
Thought we weren't comin but it seems you made an error
Wrench in the mill work, systematic terror has arrived
Cornered by the order
Checkmate sucker, not a move, game's over!
Clocks bending backwards, many cannot get with me
A logical man, I'm the epitome
My black folks travel hard with claws of steel
Hearts kneel to the raw that speaks the deal
Vanglorious, voice of the many
Voice of the many of the man wanna get me
It's not safari, so don't make a move
Protection is the reason it's a different groove
Sun up to sun down yo check the time
Mystic magic is more than a rhyme
I bring a little taste of the unearthed bass
Problem with the truth?  Then bring it to my face
I'm outraged as I write the page
A sun forged sword mince a wimp twelve gauge
any day my son, I don't like guns
I don't like roses that I step on for fun
in the first place, 3rd Bass?  I'm at home
Waitin for the pitch so I can chrome your dome
A Brother grand slam cuts a vine like butter
Pick up my monkey and back to the mother
On to the road to pimp the unpimpable
The untouchable, doin the impossible
Kill the world of the age it flees
Ignorance swoops at the vulture's knee
It's time to make a step, it's time to make a move
Time for the nation, it's time for the groove

[Professor X]
No justice, no peace!
The definition; you DICK, with a nightSTICK
Here's a Nat Turner LICK
Freedom, or death!  Yusef, to the crossroad
I'm there!

[Brother J]
Walkin through the streets with a great war cry
Had enough and not another one dies
Nine to the rescue, run the path
Down to the mortals, and lead the wrath
(?) what we talk is with the squealing of pigs
"Them niggaz don't have permits and them takin the bridge"
What can you do, what can you say?
Life in the zero, the game we play
Fist up to get down, always ready to step
And if they hit me with that stick yo man I'll break your beck
I'll walk with the lions, stalk with the elephant
Pivot like gorilla, pigs become irrelevant
And you persist with legalities
I resist and rebel cause I'm reality
And while I'm boomin this, I'm not a Humanist
I'm just a pro-black nigga and I'm doin this
And don't you try to prove, that you can make a move
Because I'm outraged devil, it's a different groove
And if you come again, this shit'll never end
And we will fight through time through the very end
You get my point son?  You get my point dad?
I'm goin back to your caves and I'm quite bad
I do a war dance, and cause a avalanche
And do the great pimp strut cause I'm a black man!

[Professor X]
You see?!  We've been here before
The background then; the pyramids
The background now?  The Statue of Liberty
Listen; the mission, Blackwatch!
The destination - the crossroad
And all pigs, step off!  SISSSSSSYYYY!</pre>
