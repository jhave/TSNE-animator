[Drake - Verse 1ne]
Uh, black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn! I'm so Ka-trina smarter than, 
A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wiiiiiiiings..
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I bill myself 
and I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself!
Antedote, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rappin like a Shepherd with the muzzle off
...I'm next to blow -- pause
And I can hear the critics talkin over the applause {*crowd cheers*}
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love - X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prol'ly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I gotcha dream girl ridin in ya dream car
Yeah, and the visual is stunnin
I hope they document what I'm becomin  
Congratulations

[Drake - Verse 2wo]
So whatchu want an award or sum'hin?
I'm at the private airport boardin sum'hin
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if ya bluffinnnnnnnn..
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a +Monopoly,+ catch me on my +boardwalk+
Like I said we pull ya card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin world records - no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or sum'hin
My deal like Weezy first week, one point sum'hin
...And my verses gettin stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin up, so I'm cuttin off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it dooow-haaaah-owwwn
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never be my ass -- PAUSE
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck wit y'all, then don't bo-ther him 
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't fa-ther them
Right, uh...

Ohhhhhhh-oh, oooh-ooh-WHOOOA-oh-ohhhhhhhhh
Oooh-ohh-WHOOOA-ohh, ohhhhhhh-oh, oooh-ooh-WHOOOA-oh-ohhhhhhhhh
Oooh-ohh-whoa-oh..

[Drake - Verse 3hree]
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin but a protégé
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to sayyyyy
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy 
and damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin
I always choose dough like it's my only option
...'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say "Get it off yo' CHEST~!"
...and I'm what all the fuss about 
and if they talkin, I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office  same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
It's crack!
Aiyyo Drizzy, you shoulda said that on the hook
You shoulda been like, "Congratulations - it's crack!"
Yah...
It's crack, hehe, congratulations
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN~! {*crowd cheers*}</pre>
