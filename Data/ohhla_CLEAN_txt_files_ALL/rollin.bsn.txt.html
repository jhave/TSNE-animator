Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ass Shake, Ass shake
Yeah I like that ass shake
Ya'll bitches won't show me love
I know ya'll hoes ain't that fake
A real G believe that
Feelin like Outkast
I'm already big now I'm fina be on (three stacks)
She on that superman
Blue and red cop car
Can't sing a lick now she fin to be a pop star
Pop off
And I can't feel shit but my dick in your bitch
So guess what, there's only one thing left to pop off
Feelin like a vegetable with sexy hoes and sexy clothes
They best dressed
Yeah I guess they recognize who they dressin for
She step in the hall to call her man and say she just at home
At my hotel it's valentines all they see is X and O's
And I can't feel my cardio
Motha fuckas walkin in with shrooms
Now I'm fin to feel like Mario
Man I'm livin with these niggaz fantasizin life
and I'm prayin that I make it through the night
Cause a nigga straight rollin</pre>
