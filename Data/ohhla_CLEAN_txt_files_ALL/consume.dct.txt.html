Lovely traces
I can sense you in everything
The way that you move me
Takes me far away
I seek no escape
I'm dreaming through your eyes
I am wandering through your mind
I'm overtaken
By the way that you deliver me
I'm transcended
There's no place I'd rather be
Than here in heaven
Without you I'm incomplete
It's hopeless

[Chorus]

You consume me, You consume me
Like a burning flame running through my veins
You consume me moving through me
Anytime anyplace you invade my space
You consume me, You consume me

Wholly devoted
I immerse myself in you
Baptize me in your love
'Cause drowning in the thought of you
Floods my soul
I'm taken by the things you do
God you know
It doesn't matter what I lose
I'm yours

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I am in your hands
Under your command
Like a puppet on a string
I am willing to
Put my faith in you
So before the world I sing...</pre>
