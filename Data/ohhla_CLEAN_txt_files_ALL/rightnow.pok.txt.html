Southside, what it do right now
Northside, what it do right now
Eastside, what it do right now
Westside, what it do right now

[Big Pokey]
Say, what it is right now
The Pit on the track, showing skills right now
11 Field, gravy and grill right now
We getting the whole dollas, they feel right now
It's real right now, I chill right now
Post up in Cali, in the hills right now
This is for my uncles, in the fields right now
Swanging the agony, in tears right now
It's bills right now, the first of the month
I got...right now, the poppers come
R.I.P. to pop, and I pop the trunk
You gon see me pop, if I cop the pump
Pump it and can't rap, got the pump
Cause the hard top 6-4, got the jump
Falls gator on six 12's, got the thump
Got gators in my closet, like I copped the swamp
I got the stunt, I'm a mother mother stunner
I might rock the gators, might rock the iguana
Shark tank in the wall, next to the purrana
Anaconda overweight, cause I feed him lasagna
But remember how I done it, cause I bring the pain
Stain in the brain, unlock, aim and rain
I can't complain, I control the budget
Promotion and market it, control the public
...Ain't broke, cause I roll a bucket
How you gon stick to the script, you ain't chose a subject
Burn proof, c.d.'s for them...who done it
M.O.B. style, you suppose to love it

[Hook - 2x]

[Chris Ward]
I'm trying to get my money a mile high, stack on stack
Watch the Lac, the trunk gon crack and it's black on black
You get dirt to jack my advice, it's back on back
Hmmm I...around, and get your back blown back
You see, we Mobstyle, Pro Bowl
This icy chain giving hatas, the coldest shoulders
Communicators Nextel, two way Motorolas
It ain't a jail cell, that I know can hold us
This is the City of Syrup, like Big Moe done told ya
I got a ounce of...plus a fo' and a soda
I go hard when I'm...but I can still go when I'm sober
If you think that's a rap, I got more in my folder
You need a...I'm fresh out, I just sold a..
You wanna go to war...it, I'll show you a soldier
If it ain't the wide frame, I'ma roll the Rover
And if you get in my lane, I'ma roll you over
I stank like...cause I stay blowing on..
I only do features for change, and mo' exposure
Look if I don't know you, I ain't trying to know you
To see my glock, you gotta get..
