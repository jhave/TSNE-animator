[Kid Joe]
Barnyard Cosby Personal party ahhh he loves it
Personal pies

[Chorus]
The gore shit I kick is sick
Hell yeah I'm buggin out
The shit's hilarious (2X)

[Mr. Hyde]
I'll hunt you down and find you in the slaughterhouse
I'll grind you into shreds little shreds
I want you decomposed from your nose down to your toes
Now you're grub for the bugs
Every blade that makes a mark another great occasion
Now the flame, you'll attain
You can bet I'm sure to slaughter put a sword through your aorta
Till your heart fuckin halts
Push your luck with Mr. Hyde you'll die and end up skinned alive
Skeleton with no skin
I'll cleave you with a cleaver leave your body in the freezer
You're a frost cut the corpse
Inflict a sick disease to make my victim bleed with ease
No escape, you'll be raped
Inadvertently it nurtures me to murder G's
So I kill for the thrill

[Chorus] (2X)

Step into my furnace time to torture epidermis
You'll have third degree burns
Pull out my gat and place it to your cap and let it clap
In your face human waste
You shot up and you're not dropped to a plot until you rot
You're dispersed in the earth
You girls'll get molested pull my dick out and I rest it
On your lips then I'll piss
Your pockets gettin ripped you'll be my victim run your shit
You are stripped kid you're vicked
I'll leave you comatose and you'll be floatin in the ocean
With the fish you're a bitch
Take my ax out of the tac it's sure to splatter half your back
You'll be hacked fuckin hacked
No repentance in your breath so I sentence you to death
Time to die say goodbye

[Chorus] (2X)

[Kid Joe]
