[Daz]
Woke up one morning out some bomb ass cock
My dick kinda limp so I cruise around the block
Call my cousin Snoop as I swoop in the Coupe
Stop by my homey Dru house to puff on the loop
Seen my little homey Style who I ain't seen in a while
Damn near gone, floatin on cloud one-nine
Liquor sto', so I grab some mixed gin and juice
Got a quarter pound of bud so I'm fucked up two
seven, eight, nine ten eleven twelve
Bailed back in the crib (For what?) Because I'm all-in
Conversated then I dug the hoe out
I fixed me some food, then go the hell out
Two A.M. on the dizot, I pause and I stizop
I reminisce on that ass that I rizocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Yeahh, and I'm feelin alright
Four A.M. as I stoll back to my crib
to see what's with my woman and my newborn kid

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!

[Nate Dogg]
I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me
But when I take her home, and tap that ass I'm gone
I'm just a dog don't blame me

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Now do I love them hoes?  (HELL NAW!)
And why is that? (Because you're Snoop Doggy Dogg!)
(And you never gave a fuck about a bitch;
 cause to you, bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks)
Ha hah, dee dee dadi dadi dah
Listen to the sounds from my nigga Doggy Dogg
Slidin through the city in the rag six-fo'
Hoppin like a motherfucker tryin to find a hoe
Hittin all the spots but I'm comin up blank
I'm headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I
puts my nine double-M to my side, as I
continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin, wishin
upon a star, to come up on some ends
but she caviar, and I let her bet her pussy
so I can get my pimp on
Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone

[Big Pimpin]
I have pimped my pen, on cold Michigan nights
and the bitch didn't freeze up on me, when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
and the bitch didn't drip, smell, or run
as she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
for I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen... and she is number one, in my stable
Pleasure, is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his pay
Dedicated the hoe, dedicate for sure
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Love is being checked, from a hoe
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
that gets sucked, ALL day long
A tangy, little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Dedicated like everyday... to the sunshine
Yeah my hoe brings me mine
For like she says she does
And I believed her when I accept it
Yeah I got pimp bones in my body
and I rock them, like la-di-da-di
I rock them, mighty hardy, like la-di-da-di
I got pimp bones in my body</pre>
