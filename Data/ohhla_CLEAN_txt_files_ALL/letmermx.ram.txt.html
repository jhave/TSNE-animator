Fabolous, Desert Storm, WHAT!

[Fabolous Sport]
Uh, ma, I'm talking about intercourse in the Porche
Making you scream 'til your voice end up hoarse
You telling your friends how I bend you across the dashboard
and give you every inch with force
You care how I spend and floss, treat chicks like princesses
Might throw some end across and tell your boyfriend get loss
Come holla at the F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S

1-	[Ram-Z]
	Can't nobody freak you lady, sex you like you need it
	You got a man, but I don't care cuz he can't do you like I can
	Can't nobody freak you lady, sex you like you need it
	You got a man, but I don't care cuz he can't do you like I can

You stayed the night and now your thinking of a lie
You call your girlfriend up to use her for an alibi
Blowing up your pager, wondering where you are
All alone, ya here with me in the backseat of my car
Lips to lips, chest to breast, working up a sweat
You wanna call him back, but you can't cuz it ain't over yet
No, no

Repeat 1

Sneaking around every chance you get, baby
Calling my phone, telling me how much you miss me
The way I hold you tight (Yeah)
The way I love you right (Uh huh)
Can't nobody do you baby like I'm gon' freak you lady!

Repeat 1

[Fabolous Sport]
Uh hmm, uh huh, nope, Fabolous, c'mon nope
Uh, I know chicks stiff you, how I leave chicks cripple
That's why you blowing kisses with my ?six dip two?
I be the one with big lips who lick nipples
And you don't even know that you dick with, boo
I love the way you shake your butt everytime you take a strut
I'm the type that pipe you 'til it ache your gut
I might be mistakin' but,
how you with a nigga that make you nuts and don't make you nut?
I know he probably think you creepin' around (*Pager goes off*)
Look, that's probably dogg beepin' you now
If he can't do it like a kid, you better drop him like he hot
It's all right, all type, let me be the one

Repeat 1 to fade

[Fabolous ad-libs]
Yeah, yeah, uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Please

Prestige
Ram-Z
Desert Storm
