Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass
It ain't a secret
Baby turn around
I wanna see it, tryin' to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram

Uh, I think I found one 'cause I got that fever of [?]
Gotta self around one, ass like Serena, that's okay
'cause I love my stereotypes, my girls in tools
That maximum exposure [?] know what I wanna do
Telling all the girls, all around the world, my last name must be Robin
'cause I'm basking in these asses, all thirty flavors keep calling
My my my my vanilla Cinderella love it when I tell her drop it
A butter pecan but I love my chocolate

I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass
It ain't a secret
Baby turn around
I wanna see it, tryin' to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram

[Pitbull]
She got that butt donk-donkie-donkie
They so fat, they so chunky,
Call me Michael Jackson, hi hi
'cause I love to play with monkies
This the Miami thing, that's right
We down for anything that's right
YouTube everything, that's right
Flow right to Pitbull anything
I'm off the chain and lane lane, lane lane
Ustedes saben quien es quien
Mira salinga con toda esa [?]
Como tu sabes estoy loco
Pero que bueno que era poco
Mami mueve los coco
I don't care where you're from
As long as you got that [?]

I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass
It ain't a secret
Baby turn around
I wanna see it, tryin' to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram

Now turn left, turn right
Turn around you could tell what I like
She love good, she so bad
She kick it up, drop it down, look back

Babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram

I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it, baram bam baram
I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it, baram bam baram

I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it, baram bam baram
I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it, baram bam baram</pre>
