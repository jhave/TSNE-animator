I promise

I give you the truth (uh Jin)
This song is dedicated, to everybody that stays true to themselves
Cause at the end of the day, that's all we've got, true story

[Chorus 2x]
All I got in this world, is my word and I promise
I will never break it, hey I'm being honest
I give you the truth, that's no secret
That's a promise and I promise I intend to keep it

The truth is I don't know what I'm doing but I'm trying
I'd be lying if I were to sit here and tell that I am
In control know where I'm going then again
The problem is where I'm going no one has ever been
Nobody ever came and did it quite like Jin
See I can do it like this with or without a pen
This shit is real, it can never be pretend
It's getting harder to figure out who's enemy or friend
And ever since, I decided that I should
Step into the industry I told myself that I would
Never forget my roots and always to remember
That they don't understand you so they won't work with your agenda
And every time I got called a chink I didn't blink
I just said to myself think Jin think
It's gotta be a better way to overcome the devil
I promised to myself I'd never surcome to their level

[Chorus 2x]
All I got in this world is my word and I promise
I will never break it hey I'm being honest
I give you the truth, that's no secret
That's a promise and I promise I intend to keep it

I'm speaking on behalf of anybody that has ever told somebody
Things are wrong but I intend to make them better
Never make a promise if you don't intend to keep it
Cause the person that you make the promise to will always peep it
You reap it, you sow it, you know it
You always see yourself to stand by your word and always uphold it
Like a marriage through sickness and through health
For richer or for poorer never love nobody else
In holy matrimony but yo you know that's phony
If partners ain't committed it just makes the act unholy
Or when parents tell their kids that they love 'em
But they're never around to kiss them hold them or hug 'em
Too busy out thuggin' or maybe out clubbin'
It's never too late you thought it was but it wasn't
So hold your child and look them in the eyes and promise them
That you'd never ever walk out of their lives

[Chorus 2x]
All I got in this world is my word and I promise
I will never break it hey I'm being honest
I give you the truth, that's no secret
That's a promise and I promise I intend to keep it

I never let the fame hit to my brains I promise I promise
And when I'm gone ya'll remember the name I promise I promise
I came here to share my joy and my pain I promise I promise
After this the game will never be the same I promise I promise
We promise never to forget the innocent lives
The victims of 9/11 the children, husbands and wives
The soldiers that died, that should've survived
To all the mothers that lost one we hear your cries
The government lies, it's written in the skies
I know it all you gotta do is look into their eyes
Call the gardener and tell him it's lights out
And promise to never have no bushes by the White House

[Chorus 2x]
All I got in this world is my word and I promise
I will never break it hey I'm being honest
I give you the truth, that's no secret
That's a promise and I promise I intend to keep it

I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise</pre>
