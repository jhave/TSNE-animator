Intro: Pitbull
Noelle, she rock, rock, rockin' it
Pitbull, he rock, rock, rockin' it
Felli Feezy rock, rock, rockin' it
And it's like that

[Verse 1: Noelle]
Turn it up
Now you know this is my song
Make me wanna break it down
On you all night long
Got my little bitty skirt
And my high heels on
All I need is a cutie
And I can't go wrong
That's when
That's when I noticed you, soon as I stepped into the room
The music's jumpin', but I noticed somethin' about you
So I just took it to the floor
Hopin' you would come and show me more
If it is like that

Chorus: Noelle
Oooh
Who taught you how to dance like that
And dude
Who taught you how to move it like that
Yeah, oooh
I love it when you do it like that
And I know we gon', kick it tonight
If it is like that

[Verse 2]
The string got me feeling real nice
And the spot's so hot
I could dance all night
Boy, you know ya got me going
And I can't sit down
What you working with, baby
Well, I'm gon' find out
That's why
That's why what I'm feeling, what I'm feeling as I dance with you
Our body's overheating, but I'm trying to be cool
Oooh, baby, when we leave the floor
I can't wait for you to show me more
If it is like that

Repeat Chorus

Pre-Verse: Pitbull
All my ladies in the club tonight
Hit the bar, take a shot, and get, get right
All my boys in the club tonight
Roll it up, light it up, then get, get high

[Rap Verse]
Ride with me, ride with me, right
Pit's that chico that'll spit that
Fire
Fill that cup
Blow that
Fire
Trick us, one-two-three will .45 ya
If you get out of line, get off your ass
Get on the grind, get on the floor
Let me jump right behind
Catch 'em in the club
Jugglin' dames
That's me
No change, no game
I'm lookin' for them women that ain't got no rings
Ready for whatever, like it ain't no thang
Walkin' through the club like my shit don't stank (Stank)

[Pitbull (Noelle in background)]
We on fire, we on (Fire)
We on fire, we on (Yeah)
We on fire, we on (Fire)
Dawg, it's like that

Bridge: Noelle
Boy, you know that (Oooh)
We gon' have to kick it tonight (I'm, fire)
We gotta party, baby (Yeah, I'm fire)
Let's get it started, baby
And you know that (Oooh)
You gon' put it on me tonight (I'm, fire)
I gotta party, baby (Yeah, I'm fire)
Let's get it started, baby
