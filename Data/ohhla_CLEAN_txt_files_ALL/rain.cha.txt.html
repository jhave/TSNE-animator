(*talking*)
I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

[Chamillionaire]
They told me that pain was just in the frame, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To help with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat
And that one tire, left a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithe, and you yell at her back for what
So the pastor can ride faster, get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back around damn

[Hook: Billy Cook]
Keep your head up is what they telling me, what it gotta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me, rain drops round up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me, don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me, till my heaven gets cloudy bout a memory

[Scarface]
God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused by my psychological setbacks
In the storm, watching out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so all long faces, let it rain

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to lift as much as me partna
(Could tell you stay strong) you're trying, but help is just what you doubting
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

[Hook]

[Billy Cook]
Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x

[Hook]

(*singing*)
My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah

(*talking*)
When it seems like nothing but dark clouds
Are raining in on your bright, sunny day
Remember, the sunlight always comes after the rain
You should be thankful, everyday
Should be a celebration, of life</pre>
