[Diddy]
Aiyyo turn me up in my headphones man
I want this shit motherfuckin blarin
It ain't loud enough man
Oh these muh'fuckers think I'm gon' play with 'em
Oh I ain't gon' play wit'cha - I ain't gon play wit'cha man!
Ha ha ha.. I need y'all to sing children
Sing, I like it when the children sing
I like it when you sing; I like it when they sing man
That lets you know something's comin
Oh it's comin - aww man something's comin
I like this sound of this - something's comin

You can picture like a photograph, envision the image
Of one-two-fifth street and Lenox
The old folks their souls are cold like tenants
Tryin to keep your weight up better eat that spinach
For four twenty-five niggaz lives get diminished
The world serious, I'm tryin to win a pennant
Cops be on patrol through the block every minute
Itchin just to pop somethin, swearin I'm a menace
They disturb me but it's love like tennis
Man, cap to the side and my jersey is vintage
Chicks'll make a nigga dick hard like a Guinness
Damn it's a scam but I handle my business
Tryin to be the man if the Lord be my witness
Do my {?} with the walk sign for my physical fitness
16's sicker than all signed flows it's ridiculous
Hold up

[Chorus: children sing]
Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up
Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up
Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up
Hold up, hold up hold up hold up hold up

[Diddy]
Easy now I'm seein 'em, mind where you patrol
Fall back young'un, play your lane like a goal
When his majesty speaks, speech defy gravity
Bluetooth nigga but I don't have any cavities
Diddy got it wrapped like cocoons
Pop shit like needles through {?} balloons
I urge you to tell a friend, warn a brother
About my splurges, merges with Warner Brothers
Thugs actin funny cause chicks call me honey
See a 9 figure nigga makin Bugs Bunny money
Eons beyond bling bling
So I chose to get engaged to these sweet 16's
Make a name, let it bang so beautiful
The theme music for crews that move pharmaceuticals
Or, suitable for, a recuitable whore
To service the whole crew when we out on tour
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

[Chorus]

[Diddy]
It's like the music will literally stop time
(Hold up hold up hold up)
We roll up, 20 deep, cock D swoll up
Get inflicted by my verbal conviction
A Bad Boy but far from a Detroit Piston
You're not focused enough, you're not listenin
You need to slow down, hold up like kickstand
Hop to it, get on your grind music
Across 110th sharp caesar with a lime music
Fine-tuned with the proper soul seasoning
Your live shows are boring you're just not pleasin 'em
Stop teasin 'em you can't rock Palladium
We bring New York back like that West side stadium
Fuck the game and if the fame went away
Still be the hardest workin man in entertainment today
Learn a lesson and that's, no questionin that
No guesswork involved so stop stressin the facts
Hold up

[Chorus]</pre>
