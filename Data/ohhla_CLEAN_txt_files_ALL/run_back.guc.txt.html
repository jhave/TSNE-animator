[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Now it don't stop 'til the fat girls sings ('til the fat girl sings)
When it's over hit 'em with the violins (hit 'em with the 'lins)
Go {*6X*} - bring the beat back!
Do you like the violins? (Like the Violins?)
Matter fact, drop the beat and play the strings
Go {*6X*} - bring the beat back
Beat so hard I ain't gotta say a thing (say it)
One Mane, two chains, three knots and fo' rangs
Eight please, excuse me, that's fo' on both hands
I'm Mr. Perfect run Mane Mane, Gucci Mane
Gucci!!

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
This for my lil' brother Nate, he ain't even thirteen
Tell Meagan Uncle Gucci say good and stay sweet
Like my children and my auntie, my niece is pretty
Love my momma more than my Hummer on Ashantis
Love my brother 50 and I know that nigga love me
Love Walker Wood Warren, R.I.P. to Raliegh
Shout out to Uncle Joe and my Uncle Bentley
Speedy beatbox on the track, take it to Jamica Queens
{"BEATBOX!"} Go, go, go ahead and drop the strings
{"DAAAAMN!"} It's Gucci!!

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
