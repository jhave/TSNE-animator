Song:   One Love
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Just one
One love yeah
One love yeah
One love yeah
One love yeah
Now from the little Rock nine
To the Jena six
We came a long way
Tell me are we there yet (nope)
From Hip Hop on the block
In the red sweats
We graduated overseas
In them Leer Jets
This generation got on occupation
Inspiration
Cause segregation was the Father of misinformation
They brought back the nation to it's knees
When some brave souls
Stood and rolled
Interlocked elbows
And they screamed no more
John Kennedy the President to grassroot workers
Hollywood to the stage
To the fast food workers
And every now and then
They pull us down again but it's cool
Cause every forty plus years
One love get through (c'mon)

[CHORUS]
I got you got
We got to have one love
Or else it's all a lie
We gotta have it
(One love one love)
I got you got
We got to have one love
Or else it's all a lie
We gotta have it
(One love one love)

I want to believe
But nowadays it's so hard
And I'm really trying to see
But my faith it lives in me
It lives in you
It lives in me
It lives in everybody can't you see
That we're all one
We came undone
How'd we become this way?

[CHORUS]
I got you got
We got to have one love
Or else it's all a lie
We gotta have it
(One love one love)
I got you got
We got to have one love
Or else it's all a lie
We gotta have it
(One love one love)

The same bullet
That assassinated Martin the King
Killed Sean Bell
Killed Bobby Kennedy's dream
Turned friends into enemies
The wickedest theme
Atrocious vultures approach us
With intent to bleed
And every now and then
They bring us down again but it's cool
Cause every 40 plus years
One love get through
And all the ignorance
And hatred in the ice just melt
And for the first time in years
The truth get felt
And from the streets
To the burbs to the west and east
Our generation got nerve
Ima speak my peace
It's either time for a change
Or they died in vain
One love's the religion
One bloods the same

[CHORUS]
I got you got
We got to have one love
Or else it's all a lie
We gotta have it
(One love one love)
I got you got
We got to have one love
Or else it's all a lie
We gotta have it
(One love one love)

Spirit come on down say
Spirit bring peace all around
Bring your peace yeah
Peace all around
Bring your peace
(One love)
(One love)
I got we got to got to get One love
I got we got to get it
I got we got to got to get One love
I got we got to get it
I got we got to got to get One love
I got we got to get it
I got we got to got to get One love
I got we got to get it
One love yeah
One love yeah
One love yeah
One love yeah</pre>
