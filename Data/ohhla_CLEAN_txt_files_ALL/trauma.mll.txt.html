Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
It really hurt me when they killed Shotty
I was locked down in my cell and I had to read about it
And when they killed Diddy, left him out in Philly
We was young and gettin' money, man we used to run the city
We was rockin' all them shows, fuckin' all them hoes
And when they killed Darryl, Renee had to see him froze on the ground
Downtown, I can hear the sounds now
When she walked up to that casket seen her son and fell down
I drop tears for my niggaz that ain't here
And still think about you even though that it been years
Cause half the niggaz that I grew up with is all dead
All this pain and all this stressin' I should have a bald head
Cause when my Aunt Rhonda died she looked Tock in his eyes
Saw death comin', when she seen it she just cried
Prolly part of the reason we drink and we get high
When I find the nigga that killed my daddy know I'mma ride
Hope you hear me, I'mma kill you nigga
To let you know that I don't feel you nigga
Yeah, you ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
Cuz I was only a toddler, you left me traumatized
You made me man of the house and it was grindin' time
So I'mma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'mma let this rain hit you nigga

[Chorus]
I know [x8]
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
I know [x8]
So I'mma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'mma let this rain hit you nigga

[Verse 2]
And I ain't ready
Niggaz wanna murder me I'm ridin' around heavy
I think they wanna wet me like New Orleans and the levees
But I got this mac elevy, these niggaz'll never get me
Lord knows, I got alotta homies in the dirt
Niggaz sprayin' metal tryna take you off the earth
Really over nothin', tell me what it's worth
Tryna take you out the game just to put you on a shirt
I Rose from the jungle like Derrick
Death to anybody that oppose my spirit
My future lookin' brighter than this rose I'm starin' at
We be runnin' trains on the hoes y'all cherish
Rest in peace to my niggaz, I swear I miss them to death
My hammer sing murda music, I'll let you listen to death
I'll have you walk with the reaper when hollows rip through your chest
Cause if you throw 'em I throw back like Mitchell &amp; Ness
I'm gone

[Chorus]
I know [x8]
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
I know [x8]
So I'mma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'mma let this rain hit you nigga

[Verse 3]
Man my life so real
Last night I went to sleep and woke up with the chills
Started with a dollar now I got a couple mil
And I make a hundred thousand every time a nigga spill
Man I almost got murked in front of the same church
My dad got carried in, family got married in
That was in my older days, this is now, that was then
Had the block jumpin' for them dollars, Shawn Marion
Young nigga gon' get my own that's why I'm arrogant
Homie need the bail, for them bonds we'll bury 'em
Lock 'em like a terrier
Breakin' all barriers
Just to beat the trial we go miles like Darius
Cause cops tryna catch me, niggaz tryna clap me
Haters runnin at me, know they wanna get at me
And people got the nerve to ask why I don't look happy
I did it for my niggaz, and I did this shit for Kathy

[Chorus]
I know [x8]
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
I know [x8]
So I'mma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'mma let this rain hit you nigga</pre>
