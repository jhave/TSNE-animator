Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Walk a mile in these Louboutins
But they don't wear these shits where I'm from
I'm not hatin, I'm just telling you
I'm tryna let you know what the fuck I've been through
Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt
Sugar cane, back lanes
3 jobs, took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say
But don't know shit bout where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub
Just to make it past where I am from

[Repeat x4]
No money, no family. 16 in the middle of Miami

[Chorus]
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work work work work working on my shit
Milked the whole game twice gotta get it how I live
I've been work work work work working on my shit
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Working on my shit

[Verse 2]
You can hate it or love it
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting
Thoroughbred in a mud brick before the budget
White chick on that Pac shit
My passion was ironic
And my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, First deal changed me
Robbed blind basically raped me
Ran through the bullshit like a matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at em
And even the score
So, I went harder
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording
At 4 in the morning and now I'm passion the bar
Like a lawyer
Immigrant, art ignorant
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate be inconsiderate, but the industry took my innocence
Too late, now I'm in this bitch!
You don't know the half
This shit get real
Valley girls giving
Blow jobs for Louboutins
What do you call that?
Head over heels

[Repeat x4]
No money, no family. 16 in the middle of Miami

[Chorus]
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work work work work working on my shit
Milked the whole game twice gotta get it how I live
I've been work work work work working on my shit
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Working on my shit

[Verse 3]
Pledge allegiance to the struggle
Ain't been easy
But cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffel
Bags is all we had
Do anything for my Mum, I love you
One day I'll pay you back
For the sacrifice
That ya managed to muscle
16 you sent me through customs
So...
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury
Turn First at the light that's in front of me
Cause every night Ima do it like my last
This dream is all that I need
Cause it's all that I ever had

[OUTRO x2]
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Working on my shit</pre>
