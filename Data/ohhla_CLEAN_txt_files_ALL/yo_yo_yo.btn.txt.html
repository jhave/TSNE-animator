[Psycho Les]
Aiy yo the heat from the 'Nuts is traditional
You taking cheap shots,its subliminal
Im dissin you straight up
Wrinkle your face up 
Actin like you cant feel me yo
This is pay back, smash your single and your video
Put the tek to your neck and force a story out of ya
Snuffed your producer and drop-kicked your choreographer  (Hwa!)
Honeys scream "Wha?!"
We they see me jumpin out the money green truck
Into the club, so we can tear it up
Like the 3-6 "Sippin on sum syrup"
And mozarella sticks for dessert
I make beats like presto!
Platinum hits like this grow
Bustin shots in your projecto 
Like!

Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!

[Greg Nice]

She tryin act like her shit dont smell
Cant beat, for loosin niggaz be jel
Comin through wit my click on my coat tail
Pump a lil wieght so I'm not frail
Sittin' back poppin shit on my Nextel
Sun goin down now time to spark an L
Do it for the kids like Kenan and Kel
Big Psych pass ya man the Visine
Eyes blood shine from puffin that green
Stay amped up  without the caffiene
Its just me, myself, and Irene
Brush your, brush your breath wit Dentene
Rock my blue jeans like Bruce Springstien
Bitches on my dick, its just a small thing
Oh! The heat is on baby baby!!!!

Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!    
Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!

Niggaz wanna see me in the club, got the rowdy squad
Corona niggaz dont play, atleast me niggaz
Gun tottin maniacs wit the rotten liverz
Holdin it down, blowin it down
Thatz my word everywhere we go know itz your crown
Put the boogie in your ass for free
