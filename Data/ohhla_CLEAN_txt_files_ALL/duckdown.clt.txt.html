You gettin' merced if you come to the murder with no gat
Have you standin' up bleedin' with ya' eyes rolled back
You sold crack? I don't give a fuck about ya' dough
I'm the reason why ya' money always comin' in slow
Come with ya' hoe so I can put four in the whore
House ain't home no more bullet holes in ya' door
Told ya'll niggaz duck down how ya' like me now
Barnum and Bailey cats and ya'll niggaz is clowns
Still freakin' it slang terminology I'm speakin' it
Red fluid in ya' body I'm a have you leakin' it
I told you duck down but you ain't wanna listen
I got niggaz that'll beat you from ya' porch to ya' kitchen
I spit too hot that's why I drink water cold
Act up leave ya' kidney in ya' dog water bowl
I'm sick but you the one that's goin' to the hospital
Makin' more money on the corner than a prostitute
I'll hit a bitch pregnant I ain't a real man
All you saw was 8 bullets in ya' babies sonogram
Never leave evidence clean guns with Fantastik
Keep beef but slick on wax this man drastic

Crazy the way I send shots through your Avi
Or your Paco switch from Polo to Vasco
Duck Down spit bullets to make your neck jerk
How you think we got our name  Murder Squad Network

I close the book on niggaz you flipped the wrong page
Ya'll niggaz can't touch me like strippers on stage
Catch me in the 2 seater the heater where I hold reefer
I'm try'na see cheese like Velveeta
My niggaz roll deep like a subway riot
You get ya' weight lost like a Subway Diet
You ain't flip a verse in a minute you rusty
Trust me ya'll niggaz is clowns like Krusty
Kill the music I don't spit for your amusement
Run up on ya' block and shoot everyone you cool with
Faker try'na floss chips like you major
Seltzer water rappers ya'll don't pack alot of flavor
I gotta 12 gauge in the whip stop lyin'
Ya'll niggaz better drop when the shots start flyin'
One slug leave ya' chest all messed up
Certified to leave you in a coffin dressed up
Bullets from ya' neck up ya' style I'm ignorin'
I'm on every track with 24 like Jeff Gordon
Skeemo got it locked like Fort Knox
Cookin' cracks in the fryin' pan like pork chops

Crazy the way I send shots through your Avi
Or your Paco switch from Polo to Vasco
Duck Down spit bullets to make your neck jerk
How you think we got our name  Murder Squad Network

Crazy the way I send shots through your Avi
Or your Paco switch from Polo to Vasco
Duck Down spit bullets to make your neck jerk
How you think we got our name  Murder Squad Network

I attack rapidly smackin' emcees that's mad at me
And actually half of me is your imagined masterpiece
In the club my nines shine when I buck the duck J-Lo
Sawed off shotgun shells the size of eggrolls
I'm monstrous I quote lyrical notes I'm a novelist
When it comes to stars I aim scopes like astronomers
My showin' is anonymous the skills be swift
Earnin' dirty money til' I'm fuckin' filthy rich
Ayo' it's business but you know I pack the camera and case
And if it jams grab the yam and Jack-O-Lantern his face
I'll make Tek hit the deck when I'm buckin' the heat
Ya' line straight like ya' life support fuckin' with me
Cuz when it comes to showdowns you know now ya' teams garbage
Man I'm heartless run through rounds quicker than speed golfers
First thing you know ya' with ya' fam clappin' ya' hands
Next thing stretched out in the back of the van
If baby moms don't pay she get it done to her kids
Leave you in the creek face first under the bridge
Aim the D's at ya' knees you half steppin' in crutches
In the cut before you puff - ya' guts next to the Dutches
