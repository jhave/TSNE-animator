[Intro]
Now don't you let me go let me go tonite
Don't you let me go let me go tonite,
Don't you let me go let me go tonite
Brandy
Let me go
Baby don't you let me
Brandy
Let me go
Baby don't you let me

[Chorus]
You know how I get when you let me go
You know how I get, you know how I get
You know how I get when you let me go
You know how I get, you know how I get

[Verse 1]
The way you love me it turns me up boy
U make my heart pound a thousand times
To let me go it would burn me up boy
So good we can just run away
You know that your my last but got me feeling like my first one
Doin it to me in ways I can't take
You know that I am that point
Ready to split it half boy
Of course you know with that you just can't
Let me down

[Chorus]
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Baby don't you let me
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Baby don't you let me
You know how I get when you let me go
You know how I get, you know how I get
You know how I get when you let me go
You know how I get, you know how I get
When you let me go

[Verse 2]
You turn me around anywhere we at boy
Your so manish but I love your way
It don't matter you just love the touch boy
We always come...
Love your cocky talk damn your denims
Make me wanna act like I just can't remember
If mama saw this side of me
She would be on twitter (sayin)
You know I didn't raise you that way

[Chorus]
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Baby don't you let me
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Baby don't you let me
You know how I get when you let me go
You know how I get, you know how I get
You know how I get when you let me go
You know how I get, you know how I get
When you let me go

[Bridge]
I get chills when your with me
Cause the way you give it to me
It baby like that
Sometimes when you say it in my head I replay it
When you can't be there
It just feels so good to have someone who stood
Anytime of day
Just wanna let you know
Never gonna let this go
Don't ever let go
Of me yeah

[Chorus]
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Baby don't you let me
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Baby don't you let me
You know how I get when you let me go
You know how I get, you know how I get
You know how I get when you let me go
You know how I get, you know how I get
When you let me go</pre>
