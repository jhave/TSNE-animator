[Kris Kross]
I missed the bus.. I missed the bus..
I missed the bus.. I missed the bus..

[Verse 1]
I went to bed late but I didn't think late would EFFECT ME
Early came around then late wouldn't LET ME
Wake up - WAKE UP -  so I can get dressed
I guess my body was mad 'cause I gave it no rest
And when I finally did awake it was a quarter to 8:00
Jumped in the shower and I know I was late
Stepped out put on my jeans and my uni'
And said to myself if I miss school I'm ruined
But I ran down hill and I RUSHED RUSHED
I ran down the hill TRYIN TO CATCH THE BUS
Now I'm hopin to myself everything is cool
Standin on my block like a fool
But (1) I'm all alone and (2) the bus is gone
(3) if I miss school this weekend I'll be at home
Can somebody come real fast to my rescue 
I'm stuck at the crib and I don't know what to do 

[Chorus: repeat 2x] 
I missed the bus [ohh]
I missed the bus
I missed the bus [ohh]
And that is somethin I will never ever ever do again

[verse 2]
I was up - HE WAS UP - but I laid back down 
Thinkin I could chill 'til the time came around
And I did - HE DID - but a little too long 
Cause when I woke up yo the bus was gone
I almost broke my neck, tryin to get out the door
And I chased the bus 'til my feet was sore
On the trail - THE TAIL - but I couldn't catch up
I guess it must have been my day for me to have bad luck
Cause I lost my lunch money, book bag busted
Scuffed up my sneakers and I'm really disgusted
And when I got to school it was the same old thing
Stepped in the class and the school bell rang
It was nothin I could do, I tried to explain
But the teacher treated me like I was playin a game
YOU LOSE YOU LOSE - the day was a no win
I learned to never miss my bus again

[Chorus]</pre>
