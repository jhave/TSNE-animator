[Andre 3000]
Nigga quit being so got damn selfish
Put it in ya pelvis
Let it work, gyrate, motivate

Chorus:
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just won't pop up over, out the blue
No after you

[Andre 3000]
Oh, thank you Lord for throwing some shy
Bones in my body let me tell you why
If not so, I'd be too, too bad
When it comes to pink polka dots and plaids
Glad to meet you, my name is Dre
But you can call me Possum Allawishes Jenkins
Andre 3000 for short
And naaw I don't want to see your thongs
I kinda dig them old school cute regular draws
And I will pause for your cause

Chorus:

[Big Boi]
I'm a gentleman, I'm a satisfy your soul
And then I'm a get mine
Like Wimbledon we back and forth across the court
Until we give out, do you take it all or spit it
Are you faking the funk and living a lie
Do you really know what it feels like
to have no control over the G spot?
It's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed
You feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox
I used to not give a damn
But now I make it a point just to please you
So you can go back and tell all your buddies, I Pretty D'd you

Chorus:

[Gangsta Boo]
Let's see what you wanna do with the Gangsta Boo
Let's cut, nigga, nigga what, I'll cut you too
Coming through in a Escalade limo, tint with shade
Purple haze in the ashtray ready to get a blaze
What the biz nigga jump on in relax wit a lady
Wit a reputation known for sexing niggas till they crazy
Whatcha mean dog, telling a play like Boo to call before I come
You a game I'm fucking you for fun
Join the bandwagon nigga it's a Gangsta Boo party
Everybody wanna join come and freak wit somebody
Riding Jaguars, riding Prowlers all sports cars
Hitting strip bars wit the top down, fuck y'all
Groupie you need to be glad you even knew me
Do me and tell all my friends my truly blew me
Bitch

Chorus:

[Eco]
Nigga you better dial 404-584 well bump all that
But shit you'd better call before you get here and that's a fact
Before you get your feelings hurt
Because you caught me playing nurse
Wit a stethoscope running around in one of those cut shot white skirts
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to idle wishes
Peeped in the window saw me cooking shrimp
In high heels and washing dishes
For Daddy Fat Sax and it's something I couldn't explain
I know it's a dirty, dirty game, but you should called before you came
