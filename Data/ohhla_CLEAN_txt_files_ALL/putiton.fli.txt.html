Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: TeeFlii]
Flii and Mustard got your body out here getting naughty
You following me to the hotel
You want me all to yourself
You gon' shake that ass for these bands
Cause you know that you fucking with the man
You say ain't a rebound
But why I catch you off the motherfucking backboard?
Even Jordan had Pippen
Just two young niggas out here getting at me
Yeah you came with that nigga
But I still had to let your ass know

Annie girl, your body talking to me
Annie girl, wait, wait a minute, slow down
And let me put it on you, let me
Let me put it on you
Annie let me put it on you
Let me put it on you
Annie girl, let me put it on you
Let me put it on you girl
Annie let me put it on you
Let me put it on you
Annie girl let me put it on you

[Verse 2: Omarion]
You acting shy but you cannot deny me
But he don't know, he won't find out no
Oh la la la, Annie make it clap in my face
Let's turn up baby don't play
You say you ain't chasing
But I see you, why you trying to replace him?
I can tell you ain't no rookie
Cause you handle that ball like a pro
Yeah you came with that nigga
But I still had to let your ass know

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Fat Box]
Got a lot on your mind, take it off
I'm a kiss on that body and more
Watch me sneak up behind your back door
And give it to you until you can't walk
Make you hang up, in your nigga face
Mouthful, it ain't much to say
Put that nigga in his place then
When you go back just make sure you tell him thank him
Just cause you gave me that pussy
Girl it don't make you a ho, no, no
If he tripping keep it pushing
And just pick up the phone

[Chorus]</pre>
