[Intro]
Yeah, need a break though..

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Driving, but my mind in the back
You are alone, but it's quiet cause we occupy to that
I left my phone, stopped for gas, then some girl named Janet call
Said it really pissed you off and you let it build a wall
Emotions tall, we're in the mall and some random girl call and Mina text it back
I ain't trying to lose it all, cause family first and pussy last
The last pussy that I had it was good, but she ain't no trophy to brag
But I should do it anyway, cause we can fall off any day
And you'll be right back to where you was, yeah, your momma place
Had things to say and girls are paid
and you just lay around, man, you're so spoiled now, only child!
Been this as usual, while you yell our business so loud
Bringing these groupie bitches around you; they ain't your friends, they're fowl
Swear so they tell addresses in your mail first to say: "I told you so!"
But first off, ain't they all alone?
Yeah, I told you so, you keep your enemies too close
Not everybody auntie know, we're supposed to be like on the low!
Remember before we've been down this road, tie your flat on the slope
Came to a stop as soon as I spoke, cause you know:

[Chorus]
I wanna tell the world about you, but this is like you sworn the secrecy!
What do we sacrifice, growing up to fall in love so fast, hope we don't become enemies!
I put my faith in God, you put your faith in me, now I'm just trying to keep my sanity!
Why do we sacrifice to fall in love so fast?
Man, I hope we don't be enemies
I'm still seeking..

[Verse 2: Tyga]
I ran into my ex like the other day didn't wanna let you know, cause usually you look the other way
Despise face with hatred, visions of me and her naked
Lies, you can't take it, cheated before, but not lately!
Lately I've been so into this shit, love is amazing!
Said: 'you was amazing spending your time
All of your time into the days when, but it's one person you relate with
You go wild and lay with!
Never been good with relationships, life difficult, she make it basic
Yeah, when I'm basic I drive slow, your body in my control
It's my control, ain't gotta go, no way, just pose like feel gold!
Let the time go, we'll go, too..
No telling what I might do without you, cause I got a pass and you do too,
But I ain't gotta judge what you've been through, cause:

[Chorus]
I wanna tell the world about you, but this is like you sworn the secrecy!
What do we sacrifice, growing up to fall in love so fast, hope we don't become enemies!
I put my faith in God, you put your faith in me, now I'm just trying to keep my sanity!
Why do we sacrifice to fall in love so fast?
Man, I hope we don't be enemies
I'm still seeking..
Cause you know:
I wanna tell the world about you, but this is like you sworn the secrecy!
What do we sacrifice, growing up to fall in love so fast, hope we don't become enemies!
I put my faith in God, you put your faith in me, now I'm just trying to keep my sanity!
Why do we sacrifice to fall in love so fast?
Man, I hope we don't be enemies
I'm still seeking...</pre>
