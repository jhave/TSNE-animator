	[Ms. Jade]
Y'all know, pimp in my walk
Pimp in my talk y'all don't wanna start
Niggaz can't ever play they ?
So I quit dealin wit yo ? with the cars
I ain't got to price them things
Keep it comin cops rollin like them things
Get 'em for their cash and things
Get a bitch ? if he gon' trash them things
Buyin up all the bar
Strummin like strings on a guitars
Think one minute I'm up by the ?
Now you can steady stop gleamin the floor
I spit shit for the drops
In a square bench truck nigga blastin The Lox
Better dial up the cops
Wait till they come I'm a show you what I got

	[Nate Dogg]
Head strong
End up on the pavement dead wrong, dead wrong
Rest of my chrome
Once I get my paper I'm gone, same song
I drive for your ?
Man you must have made a wrong turn, dead wrong
I gotta hold on
Cos niggaz in these streets is dead wrong, dead wrong

	[Ms. Jade]
I been in the hood, hood
Been to the islands, been to the woods, woods
Smoked by the lake, lake
Seen niggaz love me, seen niggaz hate, hate
Let me freak it one time, time
Same in the dark and the same in the light, light
Go get 'em on the grind, grind
Like a fiend for the white in the heat of the night, night
Get your wait up today, ??? still playin them games
Hustle for ?, rings give me the chains
Oops my Betty ain't part of the game
I got friends in the front
Ho's in the back, Nate Dogg in the 'lac
Timbaland on the track
Bubba Sparxxx, Petey Pab and Sebast in the back

	[Nate Dogg]
Head strong
End up on the pavement dead wrong, dead wrong
Rest of my chrome
Once I get my paper I'm gone, same song
I drive for your ?
Man you must have made a wrong turn, dead wrong
I gotta hold on
Cos niggaz in these streets is dead wrong, dead wrong

	[Ms. Jade]
Why these niggaz hate hard
Spit many flows, many styles, comin way hard
Never was known as a thug but you say you are
These ho's be walkin round broke thinkin they superstars
Them things they get in cars, Awnaw
Never been here before
But if you want a war you better make sure
Dog that you all the way down to the floor
Trust then you walkin out of the door
Gotta break lanes
They spittin pork that ain't beef they don't say names
It's Ms. Jade motherfucker I will break Danes
I'm from the 'hood
Born and raised I can take pain, name
I can take pain, name
See it ain't that I'm great
And it ain't that I'm paid
And it ain't that I'm ?
I'm a bitch just came out the cage
You know you dead wrong so you ought to be afraid

	[Nate Dogg]
Head strong
End up on the pavement dead wrong, dead wrong
Rest of my chrome
Once I get my paper I'm gone, same song
I drive for your ?
Man you must have made a wrong turn, dead wrong
I gotta hold on
Cos niggaz in these streets is dead wrong, dead wrong

	[Nate Dogg]
Head strong
End up on the pavement dead wrong, dead wrong
Rest of my chrome
Once I get my paper I'm gone, same song
I drive for your ?
Man you must have made a wrong turn, dead wrong
I gotta hold on
Cos niggaz in these streets is dead wrong, dead wrong

	[Timbaland]
Ah, ah, you dead wrong
Ah, you dead wrong, oh
Ah, ah, you dead wrong
You dead</pre>
