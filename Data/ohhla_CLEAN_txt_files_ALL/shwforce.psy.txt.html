Song:   Show of Force
Typed by: j_relax@graffiti.net

We exert power with metal showers at all hours 
While they devour with mental prowess and kill ours 
Show of force for harm it's main source 
We divorce our current leaders with no remorse 
Crash course position the miniature plastic soldiers 
Onto the carefully drafted, disastered dirt war 
What is it for we hurt your group 
And every troop that's with me will work toward 
Damaging your central areas with eventual pain 
The rain is repeated to gain essential upper hand 
Needed to stump the plan we land 
My artillery shoots when let loose shoots and 
My bullets rams piercing the skin of other men 
In battle we rattle the shadow of death no win 
Thin chance if you're trying to survive the grim dance 
When the bomb lands your odds for death and enhanced 
Soldiers stance warriors tranced with drug spells 
We advance through burning sands in slug hells 
Chemical warfare gasmask is the savior 
Temporary relief, release from the danger 
Silence is a stranger, anger commanding demanding 
Other sides surrendering to the strangler 
Show of force we cross and aim higher 
Knock'em down then we cease fire 
  
Take time to consider the bitter sweet no glitter 
Or glamour the hammer drops in any manner 
The scanner detects the weak speak up for yours 
Any cause of revolution and evolution of law 
Draws the conclusion of people abusin' their roles 
Hold on to the controls 
Your soul's slipping into darkness 
Heartless individual start this and part this 
Connection we bought this and sought this out 
We about it - the message - 
You never re-route or doubt it 
People might even shout it louder to gain power 
For many frustrated for truth and knowledge of self 
Wealth plays the back shelf 
What's delt, you melt 
To false livin' and misgiven and misguided 
Paths you take to make bread, break bread 
While others are tryin' to stay fed 
Where you head at 
Can't believe I said that 
But it's a dead fact 
You can't run from reality homie 
Judge me but you don't know me 
Only the lonely can lay claim the same 
Go out to the people sleepin' 
You better wake up 
Take up the whole make up 
Insert the data a matter of fact 
Scatter the chatter of every lop 
Who gather in flocks batter up 
The game's on, put your frames on 
Look at the names on the wall 
Suckas are ready to fall 
  
In the war story 
We find glory with blind fury 
Hurry up let out the power without jury 
Blurry eyes fire the weapons 
And act purely out of survival 
Rather be free or get buried 
Symphonies soundtrack the march of those daring 
Walking through the firing ranges with guns glaring 
Injustice scaring the masses to stop caring 
Tell us apart by the masks that we're wearing 
Show of force
