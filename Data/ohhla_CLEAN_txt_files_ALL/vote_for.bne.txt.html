[Intro: Layzie]
It's ya boy L-Burna, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony baby
You know what it is
Duece-double-oh-six baby, the struggle don't stop
Ten toes to the ground, where my soldiers at?

[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
Every day I wake I pray, prayin I can find my way
Every day get harder man, but I promise not to lose my faith
Every day the sun gon' shine, let the Heavens beam on me
Peoples need a helpin hand, c'mon you can lean on me 

[Layzie Bone]
It keep gettin harder and harder, beggin and borrowin
thanks to the generals, lieutenants and sargeants
Givin us guidance, keepin us marchin, government tryin to make us targets
Regardless, we strong like them folks down in New Orleans man
Meaner than Katrina, and our dreams'll never fold up man
Better hold up man, 400 years of oppression couldn't break us
But it made us, leaders of the new school, so damn courageous
Flippin them pages rockin them stages, if it wasn't for the music and sports
Could we afford what we afford? Can we pay our way out of court?
Peace to Flesh Bone, my brother gone, better believe that he comin home
He did the crime, yeah he doin his time, but he comin back strong
on you bitches, damn the riches, I'd rather be blessed and gifted
than to be walkin around lost, with a hellbound sentence
Can I get a witness, can I get a witness? It's a set-up down here
Deep in the ghetto, off in the ghetto, they don't let up down here
But I'ma keep fightin man 'til we get this shit how it 'posed to be
I should be your president, yeah, y'all should vote for me 

[Chorus] - 2X

[Thin C]
We livin off in these streets, under the thumb of the beast
If you tryin to ease the squeeze, you gotta pray
We livin off in these streets, under the thumb of the beast
If you tryin to ease the squeeze, you gotta pray, pray, pray 

[Layzie Bone]
Got a message to Bill Gates, NASA, Oprah; ask us
Do we need help? Take off the mask
Just show us love, hold us, grab us
What y'all waitin on, more distasters?
C'mon, baby we willin to work, help us create these jobs
When we do get paid the ends don't meet, nigga feel like he just been robbed
We've got kids to feed, bills to pay, spendin it on a necklace
Niggaz is wreckless, too young and restless, just flat out selfish
Just can't help it, America the great bred us like that
Niggaz is starvin, stomachs is touchin, y'all ain't fed us like that
We be's, so incomplete, why do they treat us this way?
We run the streets, we totin heat, y'all can't keep us this way
Cause we don't educate our damn self, penetrate your whole system
Take control of our destiny, eliminate y'all victims
Can I get a witness, can I get a witness? It's a set-up down here
Off in the ghetto, deep in the ghetto, they don't let up down here
But I'ma keep fightin man 'til I get this shit how it 'posed to be
I should be y'all president, yeah, y'all should vote for me 

[Chorus] - 2X

[Thin C] Every day
{*scratched*: "Fingazz on the track"}
[Layzie] Yeah, it don't stop 'til the, casket drop
[Thin C] C'mon, you can lean on me</pre>
