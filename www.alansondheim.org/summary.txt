Discussion of avatar theory and practice.

[bvh: BioVisionHierarchy file]

[6:13]  You: As an introduction, let me say that this workshop combines 
many things. It presents the history of a collaborative exploration of 
virtuality. In this, it offers one direct or hand-on approach to the 
intersection of the real and virtual...
[6:14]  You: None of this is true, none of this as matter of true. He 
and I never touch. Nothing happens here in and on a screen that plays 
out sprites and their gestures.
[6:15]  You: Alan is a pioneer in the use of computers and art, working 
in this field since at least the 1970's. One way of seeing an ongoing 
concern in Alan's work is with the "topology of intention" that he 
theorizes in his important 1977 book _The Structure of Reality_.
[6:15]  You: The dominant strain of discourse around digital technology 
tries to discover the particularities of the technology as a formalism 
or platform or medium. Sondheim's work is heterogeneous from but 
crucial to this field by insisting on the problematic intentionality of 
the digital as a lifeworldly domain in which we ex-ist...
[6:15]  You: Alan began coming to WVU in 2003 and soon began intensive 
collaboration with Sandy Baldwin of WVU's Center for Literary 
Computing, and with WVU's Virtual Environments Lab, directed by Frances 
van Scoy. ..
[6:16]  You: Students at the graduate and undergraduate level were 
involved as well, some from computer science, others from English or 
visual arts. Additional collaborators joined from the Intermedia 
program at WVU's Creative Arts Center, and most recently from the 
GeoVirtual lab in WVU's Geography department. ....
[6:16]  You: Through this interdisciplinary mixing of tools and 
collaborators, Alan radically imagined the uses of virtual technology 
at WVU. Of course, there's a long tradition of creative misuse of 
technology.
[6:16]  You: The aesthetics of the glitch music, for example, explores 
the misuse of the CD. There's an initial similarity in Alan's work 
here: working against the seeming purpose of the tools, refusing the 
normative bodies mapped into these virtual spaces, wild dancing and 
utterance in spaces where we are supposed to be still and silent before 
the machine, an _ethical_ insisting on the pressure and weight and yet 
ineluctable absence of the body in virtuality.
[6:16]  You: But it would not be wrong to insist that a distinction be 
made: misuse or glitch is not the goal but means for consciousness and 
intention to problematize their inhabitation of the technology. This is 
seance and tantra.
[6:17]  You: The results are inspiring, awesome. They are also utterly 
alien, but alien in the sense of the alien that I am and that inhabits 
me and that is there when I shed the skins of habit.
[6:17]  You: The results can be understood as works, works of art. They 
are works, as well, of the real and the virtual, worked over 
virtualities, so that the work of art is trembling with the work of the 
artist. The result are endless and undetermined.
[6:17]  You: They form in chains and links from dancing bodies to 
clouds of code to avatars to writings and on and on. 
[6:20]  Alan Dojoji: I'm interested in the relationship between 
conscious and formal systems.
[6:20]  Alan Dojoji: That should be consciousness - in other words, the 
relationship between how we think and how we think we think
[6:20]  Alan Dojoji: and the way the world is
[6:20]  Alan Dojoji: And it seems to me that working with avatars, 
which can be
[6:21]  Alan Dojoji: as much a projection of our 'selving' as our own 
bodies -
[6:21]  Alan Dojoji: both work with images, projections and 
introjections -
[6:21]  Alan Dojoji: both work with visual perception to a great 
extent, locating ourselves visually in a world
[6:21]  Alan Dojoji: and both work with forgetting - that is forgetting 
the body - when I speak in a conversation
[6:22]  Alan Dojoji: I'm ignoring my own hmmm... way of arranging my 
limbs, etc.; I'm "just talking" and listening
[6:22]  Alan Dojoji: So that occurs in and across these realms -
[6:22]  Alan Dojoji: Our relationship to formal systems is related to 
how we make sense of the world.
[6:23]  Alan Dojoji: We use systems, gestural systems, autonomic 
systems, conscious and preconscious systems, etc., to make sense of 
things; if we can't make sense, we begin to feel stress, anxiety
[6:23]  Alan Dojoji: and this can further lead to one or another form 
of collapse, perhaps catatonia
[6:23]  Alan Dojoji: To make sense of the world we have to consider our 
bodies, our selves. It's clear for example that a 'healthy body' sees 
the world differently than a sick one
[6:24]  Alan Dojoji: This is important - most philosophy or thnking of 
any sort presupposes a healthy body however that's defined, which may 
be very different from one culture to another and may not in fact 
'record' or describe the world well at all
[6:24]  Alan Dojoji: For example, that a depressed mind senses a 
different world than, say, an optimist would.
[6:25]  Alan Dojoji: In fact one might argue that depression is a 
"truer" way of seeing the world than a more rational 'surface' one
[6:25]  Alan Dojoji: We're further driven by desires; even the 
development or discovery of a formal system is dependent upon our 
wanting to develop or discover such.
[6:25]  Alan Dojoji: Desire seems to underpin everything, and of course 
'desire' itself is a word up for grabs
[6:26]  Alan Dojoji: It seems to have components of abjection, 
sexuality, instinct, survival skills etc.
[6:26]  Alan Dojoji: I keep hearing the term but not much of a deep 
description or phenomenology
[6:26]  Alan Dojoji: Desires are like icebergs - their ostensible 
content might be the peak above the sea, but beneath the surface lies 
darker matter, abject matter.
[6:26]  Alan Dojoji: By "abject" I mean matter that is partly of us, 
constituted by us, and partly debris -
[6:26]  Alan Dojoji: This is where the noise or dirt of the world
[6:26]  Alan Dojoji: is descvribed
[6:27]  Alan Dojoji: It's this matter that I'm interested in, the 
abject or obscenity that makes us human, even beyond the guise or 
presentation of language.
[6:27]  Alan Dojoji: In some senses language is a surface phenomenon
[6:27]  Alan Dojoji: In some senses what lies beneath is the "true 
world" within the guise of the civil,
[6:27]  Alan Dojoji: or the guise of etiquette
[6:27]  Alan Dojoji: or the guise of protocol
[6:27]  Alan Dojoji: Even online, shape-riding on this level is very 
different
[6:28]  Alan Dojoji: than someone hacking the machine at a lower level
[6:28]  Alan Dojoji: Where things are being bent in secret, hidden
[6:28]  Alan Dojoji: One can almost say that's the tantric level which 
must be imagined
[6:28]  Alan Dojoji: or can be imagined
[6:28]  Alan Dojoji: and then discarded
[6:28]  Alan Dojoji: after having been devoured or eaten
[6:29]  Alan Dojoji: (The face on the associative object with me is 
that of YAMANTAKA who is the destroyer of death)
[6:29]  Alan Dojoji: Now to the virtual - bear with me, this is going 
somewhere
[6:29]  Alan Dojoji: The virtual is everywhere, the virtual is 
symbolic, inscription, an index of our relationship with the real. Our 
bodies are as virtual as anything online; we're a mess of codes and 
protccols, languages, drives, instincts, communications, cries and 
warnings.
[6:29]  Alan Dojoji: Recently language has been related to gesture, 
which brings it closer to the body - I'll repeat
[6:29]  Alan Dojoji: The virtual is everywhere, the virtual is 
symbolic, inscription, an index of our relationship with the real. Our 
bodies are as virtual as anything online; we're a mess of codes and 
protccols, languages, drives, instincts, communications, cries and 
warnings.
[6:30]  Alan Dojoji: There's nothing about us that isn't caressed by 
language, that isn't languaging. There's nothing about us that isn't 
read or inscribed; the real itself is an inscription, as far as we're 
concerned.
[6:30]  Alan Dojoji: Of course here's a contradiction, language and 
dirt in tandmen or one against another
[6:30]  Alan Dojoji: Etiquette above the surface of the Victorian 
table, playing footsies down below
[6:31]  Alan Dojoji: So I model the ostensible carapace, the outer 
layers of the human and human behavior, the layers in space, 
transforming through time, morphing, dividing in both conceivable and 
inconceivable patterns.
[6:31]  Alan Dojoji: I'll repeat then type and elaborate
[6:31]  Alan Dojoji: So I model the ostensible carapace, the outer 
layers of the human and human behavior, the layers in space, 
transforming through time, morphing, dividing in both conceivable and 
inconceivable patterns.
[6:32]  Alan Dojoji: By "carapace" I mean the prims that constitute the 
avatar - what I call "sheaves" since they reference laminated things, 
bent things themselves
[6:32]  Alan Dojoji: I'm composed of sheaves. I'm a sheave-girl.
[6:32]  Alan Dojoji: If you get close enough, if you set your camera in 
me, ther's nothing there
[6:32]  Alan Dojoji: Nothing at all, empty space, and you see the 
sheaves as thin slivers from within
[6:32]  Alan Dojoji: there aren't any organs of course. So what we're 
working with here
[6:33]  Alan Dojoji: Is a kind of ORGANISM FROM OUTSIDE, which is where 
the carapace comes in.
[6:33]  Alan Dojoji: It looks, I look "real" in a sense, in a way 
related to the external world,
[6:33]  Alan Dojoji: but within there's nothing but emptiness,
[6:33]  Alan Dojoji: Once Ben Hecht was asked to describe Hollywood and 
said
[6:33]  Alan Dojoji: It's a place where you scratch away the tinsel to 
get the real tinsel underneath
[6:34]  Alan Dojoji: So here you scratch away a prim or two
[6:34]  Alan Dojoji: And things are emptied, there aren't organs, 
nothing making the thing GO from the inside-out
[6:34]  Alan Dojoji: It's topology - organisms outside the screen work 
from the inside, they're busy containing themselves
[6:34]  Alan Dojoji: which is how the auto-immune system works
[6:35]  Alan Dojoji: but within the screen (so to speak) the protocols 
are outside, they're for example
[6:35]  Alan Dojoji: here in Linden Labs, not to mention thousands of 
servers and routers worldwide
[6:35]  Alan Dojoji: that bring you this stuff on your home or other 
machines,.
[6:35]  Alan Dojoji: So when I'm modeling, I'm aware that what I'm 
doing is a kind of out-of-organic-body projection
[6:35]  Alan Dojoji: I'm from space and maybe one gender into another
[6:36]  Alan Dojoji: Although projecting smears these categories
[6:36]  Alan Dojoji: So that I'm not sure where I am half the time.
[6:36]  Alan Dojoji: All of this bears on modeling of course - which is 
what this is about -
[6:36]  Alan Dojoji: modeling the human or other organic or inorganic 
natural object or process
[6:36]  Alan Dojoji: though this modeling, I hope to better understand 
what it means to BE human, particularly in relation to all of that 
debris beneath the surface, our obscene nature itself.
[6:37]  Alan Dojoji: Sorry if this appears to jump - the topic moves 
from type to cut and paste
[6:37]  Alan Dojoji: Again -
[6:37]  Alan Dojoji: though this modeling, I hope to better understand 
what it means to BE human, particularly in relation to all of that 
debris beneath the surface, our obscene nature itself.
[6:37]  Alan Dojoji: Why obscene? Because this nature is read, 
processed differently than cool speech or conversation; this nature 
constructs readings and writings, and for that matter communication 
beyond or preceding language -
[6:38]  Alan Dojoji: In other words the "obscene" is processed 
differently than ordinary language
[6:38]  Alan Dojoji: Just as sex in netsex or SLSex or any other sex, 
even sexual communication through language and gesture in SL, is 
processed differently neurologically than "ordinary" language
[6:39]  Alan Dojoji: Stephen Pinker talks about obscenity as taking 
different pathways in the brain
[6:39]  Alan Dojoji: And producing intense reactions no matter what the 
"conscious" mind wants to do or think
[6:39]  Alan Dojoji: The first thing that appears is a negative 
emotion, fear, etc. in relation to obscenity
[6:39]  Alan Dojoji: It's a different kind of language, a SOMATIC 
language, tied differently to the body
[6:40]  Alan Dojoji: anyway this nature contructs, let's say, states of 
affairs that, in terms of organism, might be considered PRIMORDIAL, 
uncomfortable, construing presence itself, desire, an awakening in the 
world, fear, dis/ease - anything before the world shuts down in 
relation to language, to the processing of language.
[6:40]  Alan Dojoji: anyway this nature contructs, let's say, states of 
affairs that, in terms of organism, might be considered PRIMORDIAL, 
uncomfortable, construing presence itself, desire, an awakening in the 
world, fear, dis/ease - anything before the world shuts down in 
relation to language, to the processing of language.
[6:40]  Alan Dojoji: (again)
[6:40]  Alan Dojoji: So that on one hand, again there's surfadce 
language, and on the other, obscneity, and for me on the third, the 
construction of avatars or modeling
[6:41]  Alan Dojoji: I wonder if one couldn't say that one is always 
modeling oneself in the real world as well?
[6:41]  Alan Dojoji: Just different tools
[6:41]  Alan Dojoji: Now to get practgical:
[6:41]  Alan Dojoji: I began by thinking about the repertoire of human 
physical behaviors, what the body can or cannot do; I used motion 
capture equipment to record and modify the behaviors. The equipment 
installs behaviors into files, much as labanotation filed away dance - 
it's a form of dance notation - much as film records movement.
[6:42]  Alan Dojoji: If you want to see one of the bvh files that 
controls my avatar
[6:42]  Alan Dojoji: Go to the browser screen youshould have up
[6:42]  Alan Dojoji: And open up - under MOCAP (for motion capture) 
materials
[6:42]  Alan Dojoji: the file out2.bvh
[6:43]  Alan Dojoji: This files indicates a LOT about motion and the 
way it's recorded here
[6:43]  Alan Dojoji: You have a root - the HIP - which is where the 
action is grounded.
[6:43]  Alan Dojoji: Everything moves out from the hip.
[6:43]  Alan Dojoji: I can disappear underground like this
[6:43]  Alan Dojoji: because I've still got the hip root, as far as 
Second Life is concerned,
[6:44]  Alan Dojoji: above ground
[6:44]  Alan Dojoji: So after that, there are all the body nodes which 
are set at an origin
[6:44]  Alan Dojoji: In other words, one begins with a root and a body 
posture, which forms the basis for the movement
[6:44]  Alan Dojoji: If you can scroll down on thefile you'll then see 
tens of thousands of numbers
[6:45]  Alan Dojoji: These represent the movements proper - what occurs 
from the original body stance
[6:45]  Alan Dojoji: You might also relate all of this to tantra or to 
roots in sutras and tantras -
[6:45]  Alan Dojoji: a kind of originary stance which is as empty as 
anything else
[6:46]  Alan Dojoji: If you now can open, say, anitaberberr.mp4 also in 
MOCAP -
[6:46]  Alan Dojoji: You'll see a "dance" between a real-life dancer, 
Maud Liardon, with the choreography of Foofwa d'Imobilite
[6:46]  Alan Dojoji: and there are two other dancers, who are virtual
[6:46]  Alan Dojoji: And pasted in
[6:46]  Alan Dojoji: And who are controlled by one of the bvh files I 
use
[6:47]  Alan Dojoji: This video was shown here in Odyssey in Second 
Life by the way.
[6:47]  Alan Dojoji: If you have any qustions about opening the file, 
please ask!
[6:47]  Alan Dojoji: If an image appears and there's no movement, 
double-click on the image and that should start it
[6:47]  Alan Dojoji: You don't need to see the video through to the end 
- you'll get the idea fast
[6:49]  Alan Dojoji: Anyway, if you open veda.mp4
[6:49]  Alan Dojoji: You'll see another kind of mapping of a bvh file
[6:50]  Alan Dojoji: This one maps the nodes of the body into 3d space 
using Blender
[6:50]  Alan Dojoji: a free 3d modeling program (I think check out 
blender.org)
[6:50]  Alan Dojoji: and here the nodes from motion capture are tied to 
objects like spheres and cones
[6:51]  Alan Dojoji: If you can close that down and upen up 
stripped.mov you'll see more abstract shapes modeled with thebvh files
[6:52]  Alan Dojoji: Finally if you open up bulb1.mp4 you'll see the 
same file modeled by what are called "metaballs" which attract each 
other, join together - the model here is viewed FROM WITHIN, and unlike 
the sheavemodeling of sheave-girl , me here in Second Life, there are 
joints and connecting skins
[6:52]  Alan Dojoji: within the blender model. It's a different kind of 
structure altogether
[6:53]  Alan Dojoji: Ok, now the bvh files themselves, beyond their 
internal structure -
[6:53]  Alan Dojoji: how are they used?
[6:53]  Alan Dojoji: So these files, which contained behaviors, were 
then used to reconstruct such behaviors with mannequins, avatars, in 
two different kinds of spaces - ones that were completely recorded, 
like film itself, and ones that were live and in real time - so that a 
viewer might walk about an avatar behaving in a particular way, in a 
particular live space.
[6:53]  Alan Dojoji: Again,
[6:53]  Alan Dojoji: So these files, which contained behaviors, were 
then used to reconstruct such behaviors with mannequins, avatars, in 
two different kinds of spaces - ones that were completely recorded, 
like film itself, and ones that were live and in real time - so that a 
viewer might walk about an avatar behaving in a particular way, in a 
particular live space.
[6:54]  Alan Dojoji: In other words, some stuff is prerecorded, some is 
liveperformance
[6:56]  Alan Dojoji: The sensors are connected to motion capture 
equipment
[6:56]  Alan Dojoji: Which in this case is attached to the body itself 
- there are 18 sensors
[6:56]  Alan Dojoji: so that a neck sensor for example wouldconnect to 
the neck, etc.
[6:56]  Alan Dojoji: The mapping is one-to-one
[6:56]  Alan Dojoji: Leg to leg, etc.
[6:56]  Alan Dojoji: What I've worked with is'breaking' the mapping down
[6:57]  Alan Dojoji: So that the sensors might be randomly distributed 
- yes - on the body
[6:57]  Alan Dojoji: or inverted on the body
[6:57]  Alan Dojoji: or thrown in a heap on the floor
[6:57]  Alan Dojoji: or placed in a star pattern
[6:57]  Alan Dojoji: or dstributed among more than one body
[6:57]  Alan Dojoji: so that you get:
[6:57]  Alan Dojoji: But more than that - the behaviors themselves were 
INCONCEIVABLY CODED, that is, created in such a way as to presence an 
impossible body - which then becomes a distorted body, a body 
transformed by the pressue, for example, of war, of torture, of 
incandescent sexuality - an impossible body -
[6:58]  Alan Dojoji: The body is "inconceivable" because it's moving in 
ways a "real" organic body can't - except perhaps under torture.
[6:58]  Alan Dojoji: or ecstatic modeling of one sort or another, or 
hallucinatory modeling etc
[6:58]  Alan Dojoji: For me what happened, the real obscenity of Abu 
Gharayb - which for a lot of us in the US was a kind of shattering -
[6:59]  Alan Dojoji: is this distortion, this abject torture, which 
threw our own national behavior in our faces
[6:59]  Alan Dojoji: I want to explore this further in SL where at 
least for the moment it's safe to do so...
[6:59]  Alan Dojoji: Anyway to continue -
[6:59]  Alan Dojoji: But a body that, being impossible, also represents 
our desires in the world, desires which, if they could, would take 
apart a real body, dissolve it in the throes of passion.
[7:00]  Alan Dojoji: - which roughly says the same thing...
[7:00]  Alan Dojoji: Again, on the technique -
[7:00]  Alan Dojoji: The techniques are surgical, cutting and suturing 
- separating and bringing together. The operations occur first in real 
life; when a participant wears a motion capture harnass, a number of 
sensors are aligned with her body parts - left leg sensor on the left 
leg, neck sensor on the neck, and so forth.
[7:00]  Alan Dojoji: We rearrange these sensors, splitting them among a 
number of people, reorienting them; the body maps become distorted, 
impossible.
[7:01]  Alan Dojoji: We ask the participants to move. We record the 
impossible movements of a single body.
[7:01]  Alan Dojoji: The recording is in the form of a file which is 
fed into one of three applications: a 3-D modeling application, where 
abstract forms are mapped onto the recording, resulting in an 'abstract 
performance' or 'performer' - a mannequin modeling application, where 
human forms are mapped onto the recording, resulting in considerable 
distortion -
[7:01]  Alan Dojoji: And a 'live' virtual space, where the behavior 
recordings are used in live avatar performance. I'll demonstrate these 
in turn. I'll also demonstrate various ways and results of scanning the 
body itself.
[7:02]  Alan Dojoji: Ok, so this is what all of this is about, at least 
for me -
[7:02]  Alan Dojoji: relating thinking and consciousness to formal 
systems
[7:02]  Alan Dojoji: and using formal systems for modeling organisms
[7:02]  Alan Dojoji: particularly the human body
[7:03]  Alan Dojoji: in a way hopefuly that can tell us something about 
the world.
[7:03]  Alan Dojoji: Here is another example - if you go to scan 
materials
[7:03]  Alan Dojoji: (lower left), open up gunscan2.mp4
[7:03]  Alan Dojoji: This is a scanned toy gun which is 'deconstructed' 
in two ways
[7:03]  Alan Dojoji: - first by moving the gun during the scan
[7:03]  Alan Dojoji: and second by reworking the suturing program - the 
program that combines still images tomake the 3d image -
[7:04]  Alan Dojoji: in different ways - in other words, stitching the 
gun together awkwardly
[7:05]  Alan Dojoji: This scanned version is highly compressed which 
makes the image a little rough but you get the idea I hope
[7:05]  Alan Dojoji: If you look at the largescanner jpgs in the same 
area
[7:06]  Alan Dojoji: Click on 05 - this is Azure Carter moving slowly 
while being scanned with a laser ordinarily used for buildings
[7:06]  Alan Dojoji: Her body breaks down into sheaves, but the chair 
and table in the foreground are "clear" because they're stationayr
[7:07]  Alan Dojoji: So this is another area to work within - the use 
of laser scanners for deconstructing the way the world appears to us.
[7:07]  Alan Dojoji: Please, if you can, open, in the same quadrant, 
ruler.mov
[7:07]  Alan Dojoji: This is a plastic ruler, also deconstructed, 
highly enlarged
[7:08]  Alan Dojoji: If you notice, there are "ridges" visible which 
seem to repeat - serrated edges
[7:08]  Alan Dojoji: These represent the indentations, markings, on the 
ruler itself
[7:08]  Alan Dojoji: I'm using this sort of thing to look at the way we 
observe and count things in the real world
[7:09]  Alan Dojoji: How do we decide what quantity is, what an object 
is, for that matter?
[7:09]  Alan Dojoji: You can't count sheep in Sumer unless you have 
some idea of counting, markers, sheep, things, and even data-storage
[7:09]  Alan Dojoji: - a way to remember the count as it goes along.
[7:09]  Alan Dojoji: So I'm thinking about this, working with these 
visual images as a way of understanding this as well.
[7:10]  Alan Dojoji: A couple of other things, and then I'll turn over 
to Sandy after answering questions; I'll also be back.
[7:10]  Alan Dojoji: Please open, under Second Life materials, the 
vector1.jpg and then look at the vector2.jpg
[7:11]  Alan Dojoji: With these, I'm trying to find some way to 
represent sexuality, abjection , a sense of discomfort
[7:11]  Alan Dojoji: with the images themselves -
[7:11]  Alan Dojoji: This is done with both texture mapping from 
photographs
[7:12]  Alan Dojoji: and intensifying, over-saturating, the color so 
that it looks as if the skin is bursting out
[7:12]  Alan Dojoji: I've also worked with issues of disease this way, 
to see how much 'emotional debris/material' can occur with what are 
after all only avatars, abstracted mathematical objects
[7:13]  Alan Dojoji: A second area of importance for all of this is the 
edge of the protocols etc. - what happens when things are pushed to the 
limits.
[7:13]  Alan Dojoji: A simple example of this - please look at 
corner.mov under Second Life materials
[7:14]  Alan Dojoji: Here movement is occurring at the edge of the game 
space of Second Life
[7:14]  Alan Dojoji: This was done with Sandy and myself
[7:15]  Alan Dojoji: I'm trying to escape Second Life, go off the edge 
of the gamesapce
[7:15]  Alan Dojoji: but I keep getting returned asymptotically to the 
space itself
[7:15]  Alan Dojoji: This goes on and on and one
[7:15]  Alan Dojoji: on and on and on
[7:16]  Alan Dojoji: So this is another area of exploration - what 
happens at the limits of geographies/gamespaces, etc.? What can we 
learn from this , particularly in relation to what we consider the 
normative social in these spaces?
[7:16]  Alan Dojoji: Clearly this is more'lunar' than anything else.
[7:16]  Alan Dojoji: For a final example for the moment, pleaes open 
control.mp4 just above - this is a recording of a performance Sandy and 
I did
[7:17]  Alan Dojoji: and what's of interest is not only the interaction 
which is occurring at the edge of the game space etc.
[7:17]  Alan Dojoji: But also Sandy's covering the screen with text, a 
kind of obliteration of communication by communication itself
[7:18]  Alan Dojoji: Before I turn this over to Sandy, are there any 
questions? [why are you dissecting]
[7:20]  Alan Dojoji: Because we take so much for granted, I think, 
about our bodies
[7:20]  Alan Dojoji: And this taking-for-granted breaks down in 
obscenity, death, torture, sexuality, tantra, etc.
[7:20]  Alan Dojoji: In other words, our lived-body is in a sense empty
[7:21]  Alan Dojoji: (this relates to Nagarjuna buddhism btw)
[7:21]  Alan Dojoji: And at the same time is mind, is emptied universe,
[7:21]  Alan Dojoji: And at least within the world of computation, 
computers, digital and analog modeling,
[7:21]  Alan Dojoji: This gives me a gateway to all of this - 
deconstruction as opening, not taking apart -
[7:22]  Alan Dojoji: into something that, at least for me, couldn't be 
described linguistically
[7:22]  Alan Dojoji: "language fails here" or some such -
[7:23]  Wave Looming: What about the corner sample you showed? the fact 
the 'abstracted entity' was constantly turned back to the virtual world?
[7:23]  Alan Dojoji: Yes - the virtual world wouldn't let go. One 
reason I love gaz' work so much is that it breaks through 
the conventions of second life
[7:24]  Alan Dojoji: That it's almost always work at the limits
[7:24]  Alan Dojoji: And I think from the limits, the boundaries, 
that's the place to look back in and see what's going on!
[7:24]  Alan Dojoji: singing about delusion (if you have the speaker 
on) from a text I wrote
[7:24]  You: - voice in what remains is azure carter
[7:25]  You: unravelling of form as the video goes on
[7:25]  Alan Dojoji: Any other quetions?
[7:25]  Alan Dojoji: Yes!
[7:25]  You: the avatar unravels from within
[7:25]  Morris Camel: what do you think of the possibility of a birth 
taking place in second life? if the "emptiness" of an avatar could 
spring forth the life of another avatar from within (given that they 
are virtual and digitally recreatable)
[7:25]  Alan Dojoji: That's interesting - the birth is always occurring 
in a sense, since the avatar's always being redrawn, not only on your 
screen, but also by the servers at Linden Labs
[7:26]  You: - this would go to the naming in SL as well.
[7:26]  Alan Dojoji: But if you mean a birth of an independent 
organism, that occurs whenever we create an avatar, I think
[7:26]  Alan Dojoji: It's interesting, in thetext-based ancestor of 
Second Life,
[7:26]  You: Note: you must have a name and that is fixed fixed, can't 
change it.
[7:26]  Alan Dojoji: the MOO, to create something you'd type
[7:26]  Alan Dojoji: @create $thing called "sheave-girl"
[7:26]  Alan Dojoji: and you'd get back
[7:27]  Alan Dojoji: You own sheave-girl with number #5748892
[7:27]  Alan Dojoji: for example - some such
[7:27]  Alan Dojoji: Which means that youv'e created an object or a 
space in the data-base
[7:27]  Alan Dojoji: and given it a name, "sheave-girl" - and the 
server has given it a
[7:27]  Alan Dojoji: number, an identification number, which it uses 
internally, and which you can also access directly
[7:28]  Alan Dojoji: You can see all the uneasy implications here.
[7:28]  Alan Dojoji: In SL, objects are also given number/letter 
addresses, but I don't know enough about the entire structure of the 
software
[7:28]  Morris Camel: like creating a physical space on the hard disk 
within the SL server as well
[7:28]  Alan Dojoji: - in other words, what sort of distributed 
hierarchy is used - to say much about it.
[7:28]  Alan Dojoji: So our creations here (not necessarily on the MOO 
which is open-souarce)
[7:29]  Alan Dojoji: are really surface-creations, server-blips...
[7:29]  You: but the distinction between creating an avatar vs. an 
object is interesting. can't exactly build an avatar the same way -
[7:29]  You: prims on up -
[7:29]  You: different matter and entities.
[7:29]  Alan Dojoji: How so?
[7:29]  You: well, you can change shape but you must have a shape
[7:30]  Alan Dojoji: That's true; on another level, in both you have 
parameters, objects that can be manipulated given a certain vocabuary.
[7:30]  You: agreed
[7:30]  Alan Dojoji: If you build a rock in a MOO, there are only 
certain things you can do to it, just as with an avatar
[7:30]  Alan Dojoji: but the avatar appears and is infinitely richer!
[7:31]  You: can't be here without an avatar, also
[7:31]  Alan Dojoji: We can't.
[7:31]  You: more questions? I can offer brief remarks otherwise?
[7:31]  Alan Dojoji: Linden Labs employees might be able to. I think 
they definitely could be here without an avatar
[7:31]  Alan Dojoji: Just as a wizard in a MOO can be entirely 
invisible, bodiless.
[7:31]  You: yes, that's true, so different for them.
[7:32]  Alan Dojoji: Any other qustions?
[7:32]  You: Some of my comments are just glossing Alan’s arguments as 
well – and mostly what I’ll say is quite simple, part of my making 
sense of the philosophical questions Alan raises through the art you 
see here…
[7:32]  You: You can interrupt me too --
[7:32]  You: Theorization of avatars – look at any discussion of 
avatars in critical theory, art theory, etc., Ars Electronica, 
Leonardo, etc. - makes mention of their (Hindu) origin as the 
incarnation of a god, but loses the fact that the avatar is always an 
intentional incarnation, and moreover that the god can only be 
incarnated as intention.
[7:33]  Alan Dojoji: Can you repeat these? Thanks
[7:33]  You: Theorization of avatars – look at any discussion of 
avatars in critical theory, art theory, etc., Ars Electronica, 
Leonardo, etc. - makes mention of their (Hindu) origin as the 
incarnation of a god, but loses the fact that the avatar is always an 
intentional incarnation, and moreover that the god can only be 
incarnated as intention.
[7:33]  You: So, I see Alan’s work here as dealing with intentionality 
through avatars. I’ll call this a passion of/for avatars.
[7:34]  You: I think of a kind of humanism in SL - exactly tied to the 
emphasis on avatars as appearance the requirements around naming.
[7:34]  You: I am interested here in the implications for performance 
in SL. One the one hand, for the masquerade of an audience and 
performer, on the other hand, implications for performance in terms of 
the pasting of views involved.
[7:35]  You: By humanism, I think of the welcoming remarks when you 
start in SL. "We hope you'll have a richly rewarding experience, filled 
with creativity, self expression and fun," goes the welcome to second 
life.
[7:35]  You: I like all these terms: "we," "you," "richly rewarding 
experience," "creativity," self expression," "fun." Codes with 
addresses, signals with sources.
[7:36]  You: The big six social codes in SL of tolerance, harassment, 
assault, disclosure, indency, disturbing the peace redress and address 
code / semantics of appearnace. The address and source of avatar may be 
deep or shallow, but they are personal and proper.
[7:37]  You: OK. There are six social codes that Linden requires we 
adhere to in SL. They are: tolerance, harassment, assault, disclosure, 
indency, disturbing the peace (i.e. not distrubing the peace etc.)
[7:37]  You: All these social codes are about behaviors and proper 
presenations.
[7:37]  You: Similarly, Enormous work is expended building exact 
replicas of real structures and real bodies. Universities, companies, 
military units, and so on replicate their real estate here.
[7:38]  You: Here I'm identifying a drive towards fidelity to first 
life in second life.
[7:38]  You: Another version of this argument insists on marking the 
differentiations and deviations from first life. So, identify the 
masquerade and pull aside the curtain. Please remember this is second 
life! (All this goes to what we take for granted – as Alan wrote of a 
bit ago)
[7:39]  You: So, I'm noting these background assumptions of the world, 
to think about in relation Alan's work and the philosophy he's presented
[7:40]  Sca Shilova: weird thing i find is that in even in SL (as in 
RL) the boundary lays at what each individual perceives as, assault for 
example, so that you will find that even here women wont report rape 
abuse, even though it's just clicking a button...
[7:40]  You: One approach to the materials Alan and I work on is a 
question of reading in relation to the body of the other, and the 
interference in reading by technical protocols of the software, 
platform, etc.
[7:40]  Alan Dojoji: assault is just as real here in one sense, as in 
real life - people get damaged..........
[7:41]  You: well, it seems to me we (not us here but in general) don't 
have a good logic i.e. way of talking about this distinction
[7:42]  You: My remarks underline the life here as both 
representationally life “first life” and ontologically distinct.
[7:42]  Alan Dojoji: Which is also true I think of just about any 
social issue at all, "intellectual propertly," etc. - Yes!
[7:42]  You: My remarks underline the life here as both 
representationally like “first life” and ontologically distinct. I mean 
this in a simple way: we see things, through various representational 
techniques, that are like first life; we know at other levels – through 
reflection, and so on – that this is virtual. It seems seamless, at 
least at the level of signs, so land is clearly signifying land, bodies 
signifying bodies, and so on; yet discontinuous in its coded prim-ness.
[7:42]  Alan Dojoji: please again?
[7:43]  You: Well, I'm reiterating: we have a mixed zone. I mean this 
in a simple way: we see things, through various representational 
techniques, that are like first life
[7:43]  You: we know at other levels – through reflection, and so on – 
that this is virtual.
[7:43]  You: It seems seamless, at least at the level of signs, so land 
is clearly signifying land, bodies signifying bodies, and so on; yet 
discontinuous in its coded prim-ness.
[7:44]  You: So, the world of SL, the life-world here is constituted 
through this mixture or medial state; and it’s not like this in first 
life, where the self-evidence of appearance is part of the world.
[7:44]  You: Of course, immediately there are problems with this 
proposal, as there are no end of first life exceptions, i.e. first life 
has its unstability as well and well
[7:44]  You: e.g. dreams, ecstasies, artwork, and so on; I would not 
argue against this shading of SL into FL, as inhabitation of the real 
by the virtual. I’m just interested here in the difference in SL.
[7:44]  You: - I think this is where Alan'
[7:45]  You: oops, Alan's point about "intellectual property" or any 
social concept comes in
[7:45]  You: So, I suggest that the work Alan and I present here 
projects the unstability of the world through the avatar, or smears it 
across the avatar.
[7:45]  You: - a movie like planetearth.mov (see it on the SL materials 
list) is about - for me - the unstable "worlding" here
[7:47]  Alan Dojoji: For me, planetearth also brings in other issues, 
dealing with radio and radiowaves and the organization of the physical 
world -
[7:47]  Alan Dojoji: we're interpenetrated in RL (RL? FL?) by 
radiations in a way that's almost uncanny -
[7:47]  You: Aren't these related? This interpenetration is what I mean 
by worlding?
[7:48]  You: vs. a clean world that is suggested by the views of the 
interface
[7:48]  You: views: I mean the camera views, the remediation of the 
third person cinematic deigesis, etc.
[7:48]  Alan Dojoji: I don't think so? I meant it literally - 
radiations/dusts that create dis/ease, cancer, etc. in the real world - 
there's no equivalent I know of in SL, but I may be misunderstanding you
[7:49]  You: I would argue yes, that the dis/eased or dis/comforted 
body we working with here is equivalent in signifcant ways to those 
bodies in RL
[7:50]  Alan Dojoji: I'd think otherwise, since the FL body has a 
limit, that is, death, that connects to pollutions, overpopulations, FL 
violence;
[7:50]  You: vs. again, the suggestion of a clean body that 
(paradoxically) formed through the hypermediation of viewpoints.
[7:50]  Alan Dojoji: you can rebuild, resurface in SL, but not in RL
[7:50]  Alan Dojoji: What do you mean by "hypermediation"?
[7:51]  You: Hypermediation: its a term commonly used for interfaces 
where there are multiple views (e.g. bolter and grusin's theory)
[7:51]  You: the multiple views work together to suggest a single 
viewer or controller
[7:52]  Alan Dojoji: I understand, but in this context? I wonder if 
"viewpoint" can even be used in relation to cancer in FL? Perhaps 
cancer is even characterized by an absence of viewpoint... In SL in a 
sense all we have is viewpoint
[7:52]  You: - Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[7:52]  You: Well, to continue.
[7:53]  You: I want to call this, problematically, a wilderness – i.e. 
where we can't comfortably speak of single view or body or location, 
where ruptured world of SL that I described above –
[7:53]  You: the divergence of meaning and being is everywhere, where 
the masquerade is nothing but this mixed or medial state (here 
refracted through performance).
[7:53]  You: (The avatars' wandering in control.mov or corner.move, 
wandering in a corner is part of this wilderness: finding it 
everywhere, not only at the edges.)
[7:53]  You: 'Wilderness' of avatars also invokes the nonhuman and 
animal. I think here of a distinction between human and technical 
machine that maps onto the human animal distinction.
[7:54]  You: Without simply accepting these distinctions, I would say 
they need to be worked through productively. I think these are places 
where the humanist notion of consciousness and control, all over 'here' 
as it were, is broken down by a notion of wandering and following, of 
waywardness as being.
[7:54]  You: again:
[7:54]  You: I think these are places where the humanist notion of 
consciousness and control, all over 'here' as it were, is broken down 
by a notion of wandering and following, of waywardness as being.
[7:55]  You: OK. These are some quick remarks. I also want to develop a 
notion of surface that would articlate SL and FL - i.e. in the kind of 
questions raised by Alan in response above -
[7:56]  Alan Dojoji: I'd like to hear about surface...
[7:56]  You: by wilderness of avatars I mean the environments show in 
corner, or control
[7:56]  You: but also in hhhh.mov (take a look at this one under the SL 
materials()
[7:57]  You: OK. Given the “wilderness of avatars” I described earlier, 
my second proposal is to describe an ontology of surfaces
[7:58]  You: In describing the pasting of views and positing of the 
viewer here (audience), I assume that there is a reading through 
surface to an other.
[7:58]  You: (This is a version of what Alan said above: only 
viewpoints here.)
[7:58]  You: i.e. I assume a relation to this other – you are reading 
my message, watching my actions, and so on.
[7:59]  You: With the wilderness of avatars, I want to describe a field 
of performance that exceeds and destroys the boundaries of “I” and 
self, it can be a basic field of “we” or of intimacy.
[7:59]  You: Again, this is predicated on the basic 
semiological-ontological distinction of SL.
[7:59]  You: I think of this in relation to the scan materials Alan 
showed earlier or the mocap materials
[8:00]  You: see for example the largescanner images
[8:00]  sandy Taifun is Offline
[8:00]  You: here The surface is a “midst” (medium) or zone of visual 
appearance, fragrances, sound productions…
[8:01]  You: (I see these thinking of surfaces as not borders or 
barriers to the interior )
[8:02]  You: I see a similar process in the other mocap materials - the 
bub movies as well.
[8:02]  You: (that you looked at earlier, bulb1 and so on -- feel free 
to look at them again)
[8:02]  Alan Dojoji: the .avi bulb is good too
[8:03]  You: Yes, take a look at that one
[8:03]  Alan Dojoji: bulb2.avi
[8:03]  You: (note: avi may not open directly in browser)
[8:04]  You: OK. The surface as midst or zone of display is “part of 
the presentation of self of a living being.”
[8:05]  You: My point here, returning to the earlier discussion, is 
another approach to appearance
[8:05]  Alan Dojoji: I wonder if lobe.mov might not also be relevant 
here - a mapping that's half-"cartoon" and half "avatarish"
[8:05]  You: yes, good - take a look at lobe.mov as well.
[8:06]  You: The cartoonish forces a sense of the constructed and yet 
it's also directly from the body's interior -- all the movements.
[8:07]  You: I'd say: the cartoonish even tends towards the absurd;
[8:07]  You: absurd or the earlier discussion of abject images are ways 
of Surface opacity as manifestation (pastiness) of inwardness
[8:07]  You: i.e. thickening of representation as intensification of 
projection and manifestation
[8:08]  You: So, in all this, dealing with avatars not an image of my 
body; it is, however, part of the imaging of my body, part of the 
visual imaginary of my body.
[8:08]  You: I think, for me, the best and most amazing example is the 
scan24s.mov.
[8:09]  You: I know Alan has a lot to say - other things than I would 
about this - but
[8:09]  Alan Dojoji: Sandy, I wonder if you could bring up gnats.mov in 
this regard, since it's recorded in FL but has strong implications here?
[8:09]  You: yes, sure!
[8:09]  You: listen / look at gnats -
[8:09]  Alan Dojoji: gnats.mp4 under Human
[8:10]  Alan Dojoji: This was recorded in Salt Lake City, Utah - on the 
Jordan river - gnat swarms that behave as single vertical columns, 
meta-organisms...
[8:10]  Alan Dojoji: the surface for the gnat is most likely one of 
scent
[8:11]  Alan Dojoji: for us it's "constructed" out of a pointillist 
vocabulary so to speak
[8:11]  You: i find i tend to see forms, figures in the swarm, though 
it's nothing but pieces - for me, like the shieve-girl you spoke of 
earlier
[8:12]  Alan Dojoji: Yes! Which brings up the porosity, lack of 
surface, of our own bodies, something Hegel mentions
[8:12]  You: but the forms are, surely, tied to the air currents, 
weight of gnats, following each other - etc.
[8:13]  Alan Dojoji: Tied to, but also internally constructed; in the 
still air, the columns get thinner and thinner - which happens at the 
end of gnats,mp4. This "tying together" and scent etc relates to the 
skeining of any organism I think... (I maybe wrong here)
[8:13]  You: i agree: this would be the visual / appearance of the 
inwardness of the gnat (so to speeak): i.e. the presentation of it and 
its environment
[8:14]  Alan Dojoji: Should we look at things like frenzy.mp4 or 
jump.mp4 or hold off for the moment?
[8:14]  You: i want to see a similar presentation occuring through 
avatars
[8:14]  You: yes, frenzy first. under human materials.
[8:14]  Alan Dojoji: That's where the blender stuff comes in.
[8:14]  Alan Dojoji: Please open frenzy.mp4
[8:15]  Alan Dojoji: I work with Foofwa d'Imobilite, a Geneve- based 
dancer who has a company; I think he's one of the best dancers in the 
world at the moment
[8:15]  You: Award winning dancer...
[8:15]  You: This is not in relation to a specific avatar recording, is 
it Alan?
[8:15]  Alan Dojoji: And he takes the avatar material, SL for example, 
"returns it" to FL, and back and forth; we mutually interpenetrate 
activities this way
[8:15]  sandy Taifun is Online
[8:15]  Alan Dojoji: No - it's in relation I think both to our work on 
producing-as-fast-as-possible and avatar in general;
[8:16]  Alan Dojoji: the duetavatargrante.mov or thewall.mov are 
directly related to avatar recordings
[8:16]  You: - frenzy, not the file but the movement of foofwa, is in 
relation to his body in a way that the avatar movements are to theirs 
though
[8:16]  Alan Dojoji: please try and look at these - they may stutter...
[8:16]  Alan Dojoji: Yes -
[8:17]  You: so, tied to the question of appearance of inwardness
[8:17]  You: ok, let'
[8:17]  You: oop, at duetavatargrange.mov
[8:17]  Alan Dojoji: (Please do interrupt with questions if you have 
any)
[8:18]  Alan Dojoji: I'm watching thewall.mov now
[8:18]  You: Well, I know Alan has a great deal to say about 
duetavatargrange and thewall. Let me close my thoughts on surface -
[8:18]  Alan Dojoji: - avatar movements constricted by the very real 
wall of a grange in the Alps, Maud Liardon and Foofwa dancing
[8:18]  Alan Dojoji: Ok, sorry
[8:19]  You: and then alan can say more about these one's.
[8:19]  You: Closing: I set out an idea of surface as thickening or 
manifesting inwardness.
[8:19]  You: Add to this being-with or following surfaces,
[8:19]  You: being-with avatars as avatar touching avatar touching 
viewer as thickening and projective residue of consciousness
[8:20]  You: so, by this I mean avatars as self-announcement of being 
into sl
[8:20]  You: all this set against what i earlier (too quickly) marked 
as a "humanism" of avatars, where the task is to read back to the 
"driver" as it were
[8:21]  You: self-announcement as what happens in the "wilderness of 
avatars" I mentioned earlier
[8:21]  Alan Dojoji: Is self-announcement of being similar to rewrite? 
Can you elaborate?
[8:21]  You: - yes, continually self-announcement and production (with 
implication of work, economy) through the avatar
[8:21]  You: rewrite: an important concept developed by alan in the 
internet text
[8:22]  You: the subject writes and rewrites into existence.
[8:22]  You: i would say self-annoucenment is cognate, but i wanted to 
focus on the appearance of the avatar as opaque signal (thus 
announcement)
[8:23]  Alan Dojoji: avatar as emblem -
[8:23]  You: yes, ikon
[8:23]  You: Are there questions? Happy to answer more? Or, happy to 
turn back to duetavatargrange and here more on that
[8:23]  You: [quickly: i distinguish between sematic appearnace and 
cryptic appearance, both zoological terms for how animals appear -
[8:24]  You: but both the cryptic (camoflauge) and sematic (display) 
are part of the self-annoucement of the avatar]
[8:24]  You: But: questions?
[8:24]  You: Also: a quote from Mishima.
[8:25]  You: “If the law of thought is that it should search out 
profundity, whether it extends upwards or downwards,
[8:25]  You: then it seemed excessively illogical to me that men should 
not discover depths of a kind on the ‘surface,’ that vital borderline 
that endorses our separateness and our form, dividing our exterior from 
our interior.
[8:25]  You: Why should they not be attracted by the profundity of the 
surface as well.”
[8:26]  Alan Dojoji: Ok, I'm a bit mixed in relation to IM here, but 
I'll type for a while.
[8:26]  Alan Dojoji: Please open duetavatargrange.mov under the 
lower-right quadrant
[8:27]  Alan Dojoji: This is again a Liardon/Foofwa performance
[8:27]  Alan Dojoji: Before I begin with this I want to mention again 
rewrite - for it's important here.
[8:27]  Alan Dojoji: Simply, embodiment in Second Life or online in 
general is INTENTIONAL
[8:27]  Alan Dojoji: In other words, one has to write to have presence, 
has to have an avatar to presence oneself
[8:28]  Alan Dojoji: And one continually writes/performs/acts in these 
spaces
[8:28]  Alan Dojoji: As a way of ascertaining, indicating existence
[8:28]  Alan Dojoji: Log off and you're gone
[8:28]  You: - alan, this differs from RL in the sense of not being 
able to log off so easily, so to speak?
[8:28]  Alan Dojoji: Even if you use a bot to keep you online in 
appearance
[8:28]  Alan Dojoji: One moment
[8:29]  Alan Dojoji: Even if you use a bot to keep you online in 
appearance, it's not responsive to someone, although someday a Turing 
test might prove different
[8:29]  Alan Dojoji: But at the moment, you're "hereness" is indicated 
by behavior, statement, etc.
[8:30]  Alan Dojoji: So embodiment is not background, the way it is in 
FL; it's not GROUND, not Primordial so to speak - it's always already a 
deliberate and intntional construct that needs renewing...
[8:30]  Alan Dojoji: Re: What you were saying, you can log off in RL, 
but this brings up all those issues of euthanasia, legislation against 
suicide, etc., which are problematized in SL...
[8:30]  Alan Dojoji: With duetavatargrange.
[8:31]  Alan Dojoji: Foofwa and Maud were working from studying the 
kinds of avatar-moement
[8:31]  Alan Dojoji: from the BVH files you see here - and using this 
movement as a choreography, bending the human back into the virtual.
[8:31]  Alan Dojoji: So for example, their contact with one another is 
problematic - as if they shojld be transparent with each other
[8:31]  Alan Dojoji: but aren't -
[8:32]  Alan Dojoji: The materiality - what Rosset calls the "idiocy" 
of the real world interferes, interrupts
[8:32]  Alan Dojoji: just like, or in a sense just like, dreams are 
interruptions, are interrupted
[8:32]  Alan Dojoji: When we work together, Foofwa & whomever and 
myself and Azure Carter,
[8:33]  Alan Dojoji: we move betwen language, sexuality, body, virtual, 
prim, construct, choreography, improvisation, projection, 
introjecdtion, etc.
[8:33]  Alan Dojoji: all of these things so that after a while it's 
almost as if we can't tell what world we're in.
[8:33]  Alan Dojoji: Please look at jump.mp4 in Human Materials for an 
example of this
[8:34]  Alan Dojoji: That's about all I have to say at this end, - 
Sandy - or questions? Please, any sort of dialog would be greatly 
appreciated!
[8:34]  You: I wanted to ask, first, back about rewrite.
[8:35]  You: The distinction between rewrite and ground, let's say, 
insists on the distinction between FL and SL.
[8:35]  Alan Dojoji: Different modes of presencing... yes
[8:35]  You: And, of course, as you note the places we consider rewrite 
in first life are limit cases: suicide, euthanasia, etc.
[8:36]  You: Still, there is a presencing in first life that seems to 
me like rewrite.
[8:36]  You: we do "show" our selves and there is an intentional aspect 
that always there...?
[8:36]  You: in part, I'm trying to pressure the difference between 
these worlds / lives
[8:37]  You: (as in earlier, you mentioned that there's real damage to 
those hurt in Second Life, and so on)
[8:38]  Alan Dojoji: For me, that's an issue of roles, Goffmann; the 
kind of presencing I'm thinking about is fundamental - someone "is" 
there or not - the codes, protocols, are upon or within that matrix. 
And presence is different in these areas. The "real damage" in SL isn't 
one of disease, death, the violence of Darfur for example - modes of 
coercion are very different and more benign in SL
[8:38]  Alan Dojoji: They're absolute in FL
[8:38]  You: - second, can you say more about Maud and Foofwa -
[8:39]  You: there was a phrasee: they should be transparent,
[8:39]  Alan Dojoji: Yes - it's as if they're following the gestural 
order, regime, of SL etc. - but can't - the obdurate, inert gets in the 
way.
[8:40]  Alan Dojoji: For me this brings up again Abu Gharayb - what are 
people thinking when they move the bodies of others into obscene 
positionings and then photoraph them?
[8:40]  You: yes!
[8:40]  Alan Dojoji: (Which is one reason I want to see Abu Gharay 
re-enacted here.)
[8:40]  You: in Second Life....
[8:40]  Alan Dojoji: Yes
[8:40]  You: I'm curious about response to that (both from those 
gathered here and in general)
[8:41]  You: In terms of following the gestural order - a good way of 
putting it, I think -
[8:41]  You: this isn't just at the level of chains of signs, but also 
they way those stick to the body -
[8:42]  Alan Dojoji: I think, under the Bush administration, this order 
has been foregrounded in a sense - I'm thinking of the beheading of 
Perl (Pearl?) and others as well.
[8:42]  You: By "order" I'm thinking of a command and also a logic or 
representation?
[8:42]  Alan Dojoji: I think this confrontation with the imminence of 
violence is a change of regime in a sense - YouTube etc. contributes to 
this, the slaugter of the world becoming transparent
[8:43]  You: and al jazeera (new network)
[8:43]  You: news network
[8:43]  Alan Dojoji: A logic or representation of a regime of commands -
[8:43]  Alan Dojoji: Yes, and not just al jazeera -
[8:44]  You: Can you discuss the effect of setting that order here?
[8:44]  Alan Dojoji: I don't really know; I think it should be 
explored..
[8:44]  Alan Dojoji: For me SL appears like a safe house, literally
[8:44]  Alan Dojoji: in that slaughter and mass animal extinctions seem 
somehow remote
[8:45]  You: i think sprites.mp4 relates?
[8:45]  You: and wolf.mov
[8:45]  Alan Dojoji: and they shojldn't be; the suffering - YES, please 
look at this?
[8:45]  You: look at sprites.mp4 under the mocap materials on the web 
page
[8:45]  Alan Dojoji: but they're not remote, they're contingent
[8:46]  You: sprites is set at a wind power generating station in West 
Virginia, USA, on a ridge above some old lead mines.
[8:47]  Alan Dojoji: And the torn-up bodies were in direct relation to 
Abu Gharayb
[8:47]  You: There's a sense, for me, of natural power and intense 
technological power.
[8:47]  You: Also, look at wolf.mov in the mocap materials.
[8:48]  Alan Dojoji: Wolf.mov was in response to 9/11 - the background 
was shot in the "bathtub," the exposed basement of the blown-apart 
towers,.
[8:49]  You: again, the avatar is destroyed? reworked? eaten? from 
within.
[8:49]  Alan Dojoji: The foreground is a wolf mannequin from the Poser 
software which is deliberately distorted by hand until the planes fall 
apart; the mouth also opens, a destroyer as well
[8:50]  Alan Dojoji: Susan Sontag, I think, wrote about the tens of 
thousands of dead birds found around the towers...
[8:50]  You: Well, please we welcome questions from all of you!!
[8:50]  Alan Dojoji: I think this is a good place to stop for dialog, 
if we can; we've done our best to present an outline of thework so far
[8:51]  Alan Dojoji: In the future I'll be embedding these 
figures/behaviors in a Cave (3d environment) , taking it out of 
thecave, back in, etc. etc.
[8:51]  Alan Dojoji: and working with Sandy and Foofwa on the results 
which are still really unknown
[8:51]  You: (thanks alan, was just going to mention that)
[8:51]  Alan Dojoji: I also want to try working with more complex 
motion capture equipment on one hand
[8:52]  Alan Dojoji: and more complex bvh files on the other so that 
larger amounts of data could be dynamically mapped onto virtual 
organisms
[8:52]  You: There's also another dimension of exploring analog waves, 
radiations, etc. through very low frequency radio, crystal radio, etc.
[8:52]  You: that seems to me to work in a counter space or dialog with 
this work
[8:52]  Alan Dojoji: But I'm probably kiding myself - this requires a 
lot of computer science I don't know at all...
[8:52]  Alan Dojoji: I depend on the kindness of strangers...
[8:52]  You: Well, questions?
[8:53]  Alan Dojoji: Just want to mention this text will be made 
available online, with all its faullts and mistypings...
[8:53]  You: Can you think of things to take from this to your own work 
- or do you know of similar work in this area?
[8:53]  You: yes, I will post it to the website and the blog
[8:53]  You: and it will be available on the intimacy site
[8:54]  Wave Looming: just a quick comment on the spirtes film
[8:54]  You: ok
[8:54]  Wave Looming: there is a real tension between what alan refers 
to as the natural and technology power
[8:55]  You: - those were my terrms (sandy) not sure if alan would 
endorse that?
[8:55]  Wave Looming: the wind seems to be generated by the power 
planet which caused the body parts floating
[8:56]  Alan Dojoji: Ah yes, I'm also thinking of the propellor vanes 
themselves cutting into bodies; this happens with birds for example, 
but here I'm thinking more of a microtome...
[8:56]  Wave Looming: it can be read in many ways - floating = 
suffering?
[8:56]  Alan Dojoji: yes
[8:57]  Wave Looming: or floating as a result of being tied together by 
the wind?
[8:57]  Alan Dojoji: maybe, re buddhism, suffering can also 
beconsidered part of the natural order of things
[8:57]  Wave Looming: perhaps, it can also been seen as a pleasure that 
can only experienced in SL
[8:58]  You: - I think of Sontag again, whom alan mentioned earlier - 
re suffering and photos
[8:58]  Alan Dojoji: I don't really see this degree of distortion as a 
pleasure; if suffering is pleasurable as in masochism, I'd think it 
would have to be implicit in real life, felt, keywords and all. the 
difficulty for me is that it's hard toget away from SL cartooning, make 
something felt as political, abject etc.
[8:59]  You: i think, also, just as earlier we said that we don't have 
a clearly articulated language for the mixture of FL & SL,
[8:59]  Wave Looming: if it's intended to be read as suffering, then, 
it makes me question more about the agency we think/believe we might 
have in SL
[9:00]  You: so too, viewers of these videos or of SL in general don't 
know how to process the content & poltical point
[9:00]  Alan Dojoji: I'm not sure the reading is that "intended" but 
certainly the sphere, reference, is
[9:01]  You: I think this question, like that of "staging" abu ghraib 
here is an important one - especially if tethered to other media 
(youtube, etc.)
[9:01]  Wave Looming: it brings back the issues relates to the limits 
in SL which also applies to the technological limits in RL
[9:02]  Alan Dojoji: What I've seen or heard about re-enactment here - 
it's art performance about art performance; I'm not sure why, when 
there are so many more urgent things to explore
[9:02]  You: - yes. Other questions?
[9:02]  Alan Dojoji: The technological limits in RL are also -vis-a-vis 
bandwidth - limits in SL. This is also related to limits of economy - 
who canafford, for example, DSL, who has access to T1 or T3 lines at 
what institutions, etc. -
[9:03]  You: yes, or simply the economy of development, programming, 
etc. definitely.

[I take the radio because there is nothing left to do; voice enters the

disgust, lassitude, detachment, decathecting, disinvestment, that renders 
objects and the world la nausee, worthless, used-up, spent. It accompanies 
the corrosion of desire; it accompanies the borderline. Defuge, undercut-
ting the digital or discrete with the uncomfortable analog-abject, the 
fissured real.]

Perhaps a way of teaching media 

(I've been filling in for a couple of film courses at Brown University, 
and this has led me to think through distributed knowledge in an 'open' 
classroom, and how that plays out. The courses were, I think, extremely 
successful. I've been partly inspired by two artist/teachers from the 
1970s-80s: David Askevold at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, 
and Lutz Presser at the Tasmanian School of Art. Neither of them taught in 
any conventional sense; both had a sense of student professionalism and 
'being' that created outstanding works and environment. So below is just 
some thinking about all of this; it's hardly original. it seems to work 
well for me and my students, most of the time. There are also times I'm a 
miserable, neurotic failure, but that's another issue, and not necess- 
arily related.)

1 In terms of authority - everyone in the class, including the teacher, on 
equal footing. I think authority comes from knowledge, not titles, formal- 
ity, etc. This is hard to do within an institution where power is the 
fundamental backdrop of the classroom, but I've done it as much as poss- 
ible.

2 Distributed knowledge among students and faculty. In many areas, partic- 
ularly those dealing with digital and popular culture, students are often 
more knowledgeable than faculty. This is especially true with software - 
students are apt to have used and hacked programs I haven't. Knowledge is 
distributed and students and faculty work together, empower each other. 
The classroom becomes a holarchic space of production, exploration, and 
critique. I have to recognize that what I know, in many areas, is already 
outdated.

3 No assignments except for technical in the beginning which may or may 
not be completed. Students find their own paths through the class, subject 
matter, and production. Students who are confused or aren't motivated 
should be helped along, of course; the more collaborative the class is, 
the more these students might be carried forward within a general atmos- 
phere of communality. This area might be the most difficult - how to work 
with unmotivated or reticent students - but I've found there are almost 
always workarounds; at times, students might even ask for assignments or 
help with content and/or media.

4 Learning equally from students as students from you. This goes along 
with distributed knowledge; there's also distributed learning. If I'm not 
learning, I'm not teaching well; if the class seems closed in this 
respect, I'm doing something wrong.

5 Students/faculty = equal participants. Again, this plays out against the 
backdrop of fundamental power, but that power should be deconstructed as 
much as possible. Along with this - try to interest as many other faculty 
as possible in the course (I've not been so successful here), and encour- 
age students to bring outsiders in as well. Obviously there are limits on 
this, but in general it works well.

6 Students treated as artists/writers/filmmakers to to the fullest extent 
possible. The most successful classes I've seen are those in which stu- 
dents are considered as producers in their own right. If I begin with the 
idea that what a student is doing isn't 'student work,' more often than 
not, I've found that students rise to the occasion.

7 "Professional" advice. Discussing art-making after university - how to 
present, distribute, survive, both online and offline. Encouraging stu- 
dents to submit work to suitable venues, organize screenings or exhibi- 
tions, etc. I've also encouraged students to do their own media/art 
history as much as possible; what's current is what is/will become the 
student's environment, once she leaves university. I've tended to share my 
own work/experiences in class to a limited extent, trying to keep students 
from stylistic influence.

8 Students are free to work on whatever, including sliding into other 
genres, media. Since the work is student-determined, ostensible class 
content might not be the most suitable for a particular project. Instead 
of dropping the project, perhaps change it, or change media.

(I feel I'm not presenting this stuff as well as I should be; others have 
done a far better job of it. The main points are both a kind of withdrawal 
on the part of the teacher, and an emphasis on distributed learning and 
production on the part of the class as a whole. This doesn't work for 
everyone in all situations - but when it does, the results are amazing in 
so many ways.)

[Why is this here, other than it works pedagogically? Because it argues 
for dispersion, de-centering on a practical level, perhaps teacher and 
students as emanents.]

defuge6

The stem of the 6 leans forward, ready to topple.
The stem of the 6 is retained by the entire and complete
calculus of capital.
The calculus of capital is thick, exhausted, is always
exhausted, is always singular, singularity, always 
the point and paste of the thing.
The calculus is in opposition to glue holding disparate
parts together _as such._
The calculus of capital knows only the unary divide.
And the unary addition and the unary increment
and substitution. And the unary substitution.
In my weary world the head bobs uselessly.
It looks in the thick of things for clock and radio.
It pulls the sheets up and pulls the sheets down.
It wraps and unwraps the cadaver of the body.
Beware the thud of 6 and thud of capital.
What is ready to topple sooner or later topples,
sooner or later revives into disparate parts.
(What is ready to topple has the consistency of glue.)

second life third life

begin by setting out directions, these are the five healthy directions, 
the middle direction is one of exhaustion and ecstasy, then in the 
direction opposite the middle direction set out the last direction, which 
is one of wounding and suffering. if the middle direction is reception, 
the last direction is penetration, if the last direction is reception, the 
middle direction is penetration. set the house in order from the middle 
direction outward, these are the spokes which narrow to the point of 
intersection between the middle direction and last direction. now forget 
the four directions, concentrate on the spokes, the point, the middle and 
the last direction. then concentrate on the spokes, forget the point, the 
middle and the last direction, the spokes come close to the point, forever 
close to the point, but the point is absent, emptiness, emptiness radiates 
outward between the spokes. now forget the spokes, emptiness radiates 
among the ghosts of them, the spokes are hungry ghosts, they gnaw at 
emptiness, they are wounded, they are defeated, they disappear. now think 
of emptiness, think of nothing else, think of nothing. now you have laid 
out the house and the world and the word, but you are in ignorance, you do 
not know house or world or word, if you think house or world or word you 
must begin again, laying out the five directions and so forth. now you 
have come to an end and you are ready to begin, you have come to the 
beginning, and you are ready to end. now continue.

you must imagine now yourself and house and world and word annihilated, 
you must imagine annihilation of annihilation. you must imagine almost all 
pleasure, among taste of delight and touch of exaltation, and among scent 
of numinous being and sight of untold beauty and hearing of harmonious 
sounds. now you must imagine another being joined to yourself and house 
and world and word, you must imagine penetration reception and reception 
penetration, you must imagine fullness and overflowing of delight. now you 
will find you are creating and you are making sheave-woman and sheave-man, 
you are sheave-woman and sheave-man, you have sheave-sight-and-sound, you 
have sheave-touch-and-scent, you have sheave-taste-and-mind, you have 
sheave-passion and sheave-ecstasy. now you will walk and remember, you 
will remember everything, and you will speak and hear, see and taste, you 
will forbid nothing, you will not be forbidden, you will rise above and 
sink below, you will be among the direction of wounded and suffering. now 
you will do this for a long time, for aeons.

now you will embrace emptiness, you are making sheave-other, you are 
making sheave-emptiness, you are making wrath, are making creation, are 
making annihilation. now you are making annihilation, now you are among 
them, beneath them, above them, now you are beyond them. now you are no 
longer imagining, you are no longer thinking among them, you are no longer 
thinking, no longer sheave, no longer thought, now you are annihilation, 
now you are making nothing, now you are annihilation, now you destroy 
house and world and word, now you are destroyed, now you are annihilation, 
you are free, you are emptiness, you are annihilation, you are emptiness, 
now you are free.


Derivation of "Bug," telegraphy code, etc.


"Bug" has been traced vis-a-vis computer folklore to early programming/ 
hardware/software/etc. as far back as the 1950s I believe. But recently 
I've come across a much earlier source. In The Telegraph Instructor, 4th 
and revised edition, 1908, G.M. Dodge gives a list of telegraph terms.

"Bug-in-the-wire -- A slang phrase frequently used when a wire is in 
trouble."

This relates to "buggy," "he's bugged," "stop bugging me," and so forth; 
what's interesting is the noun related to communications technology. In 
relation to computers, this might be a case of convergent evolution, but 
it's more likely to have moved through telegraphy - telephony - radio - 
and so forth, into the habitus of information theory and cybernetics.

Another early term relates to the origins of "ham" in "ham radio" - 
although the exact source of this remains unknown:

"'Ham' or 'Plug' -- A telegraph operator, who is not proficient."

[A number of phrases we take for granted are older than they appear. For 
example, "so long"; from A. Wallace, Popular Sayings Dissected, 1895: "So 
long! a leave-taking, a piece of colonial terseness is equivalent to 'au 
revoir, saluons!' of which latter word it may be a direct corruption, or 
again of 'salaam,' a bow, or 'salem,' 'peace be with you.' The phrase may 
be paraphrased into 'Goodbye, so long as we do not meet.'"]

On another related topic, early Morse code was somewhat different; there 
were all sorts of variations - Navy Codes, European Codes, Morse American 
codes, etc. The same book gives for example, "The Morse code of signals as 
applied to the telegraph is used exclusively in the United States." The 
code as given has three dash-lengths; for example,

t is - 
but 
l is -- 
and 
0 is ---- 
In addition, 
c is .. . 
that is, some letters have small breaks within them; while 
i is ..
o is . . 
and 
y is .. .. 
and Further, there are some longer strings; ending parentheses
) is .....  .. ..
and
capitalized letters are indicated by .. . .-..
- so it goes. (Oddly this has been difficult to type, since I wanted to 
eliminate meta/diacritical marks which might have been taken as part of 
the code itself!)

The actual telegraph (semantic) code on top of the Morse results in 
messages such as

Wr r ty gg r 9
or
Es r ty cn
and addresses/headers can read as obscurely as
Hr tru pink No 38 VO HW "HX" ck 12 collect N P R

The code, like international signals codes, is heuristic, ideographic, and 
was simply memorized by the telegraph operator. It was just as complicated 
for railroad telegraphy, where the difference between 19 and 31 - both 
meaning "train order" - was complex. 

Note that this is triple-coding - Morse to telegraphic code to ordinary 
language, and that, while natural language is fond of redundancy (re: 
Shannon/Weaver), telegraphy is dominated by economic considerations. 
Thus word counts, and what constitutes a word, are critical. For example:

Van Dorne - 1 word
Queen Anne County - 3 words
44.12 - 5 words
No. 185 22nd St - 8 words
North Carolina - 1 word
10 000 000 - 8 words
and so forth.

The telegraph operator also had to understand railroad Engine Steam 
Whistle Signals; here are a few (o - short sound and --- long sound):

o Stop. Apply breaks.
--- --- Release Breaks.
--- o o o Flagman go back and protect rear of train.
--- --- --- --- Flagman return from west or south.
--- --- --- --- --- Flagman return from east or north.
--- --- --- When running, train parted; to be repeated until answered.
o o Answer to any signal not otherwise provided for.
--- --- o o Approaching public crossings at grade.
o o o o Call for signals.

Air whistles are different, as are torpedo signals, light signals, 
semaphore, etc.

Service Message Code:

N S N - No such number.
G B A - Give better address.
G S A - Give some address.
DFS - Disregard former service.
92 - Deliver.
Deld (or) 92d - Delivered.

There is also Phillips Press Code - an example:

"A dsx rain es wind storm psd tru t nt end o ta county tsm dsyg a gt deal 
o prpy, roofs wr bln off a no o sma blgs es nux trees wr uprtd. A barn 
blng to James Sampson ws stru by lghtg kig 3 horses es burng svl tons o

elegy for Boojum, our companion cat, we are all poor,


'i can't do elegy' -
this is a poor and sleepless poem -
when something's at the limit there's nothing more to say -
for a moment i might have reversed the process
but heard nothing more than wailing or sounds like an animal -
nothing of crying, just tattered sound -
nothing of warning, fear, existence, trepidation -
nothing can be said on either side of death -
neither this one nor that one -
neither this nor the other -
death is an other -
(eighteen years, and death is an other) -
death is everywhere, death is not around -
(eighteen years, and death is everywhere,
death is poor, death is not around) -
always already other can't speak can't hear can't see -
double needles, of sedative, of anesthetic overdose -
doubled needles -
who are these people & their kindness -
(eighteen years and the kindness of strangers) -
i'm done with it, the other's never done with it -
always the last trip last day last night
last meal last touch last scent last sound -
(eighteen years and the last day and night,
last touch and meal, last scent and sound) -
in and out of the thick of it -
the thick of it never changed -
it stayed dry, viscous, substance and fissure -
it's uncomfortable, stains, sticks to everything -
lives on in us, exchanged, drops to the ground -
crawls out, walks to the sea, drops to the ground -
i can't drop to the ground, i drop to the ground -
there's an elegy on, everyone's there -
she says i think we're at the beginning of speech -
she says she's very sad and wants to go hone -
she stood dry, unattended -
(eighteen years and dry and unattended,
accompanied and unaccompanied, who can go 
into and out of the world) -
the fire went out, into the world --
today someone counted elements,
earth, fire, water, wind, air, heat, dearth, 
wood, & metal -
(eighteen years and the counting of elements) -
how was the air, the air was cold, bitter,
the wind harsh, we turned the carrier against 
the wind, dearth of it all, harboring a flame
until the last, dying in our arms, the metal table,
off to a far wood of hunting -
the world is filled with secret coordinates -
impermanence of the metallic -
she says she thought of the limit -
in a small heaven somewhere -
& now we are silent in the night, existence is silent -
existence crawls, we heard her cries, the catheter
carefully inserted elsewhere in the building -
we held her heat against us, we exchanged heat -
the tablets - prayer wheel spinning above a slow flame -
we couldn't bear to empty her water, clean
her bowl of food, now despair reigns, & in our arms
nothing happened, everything seized --
'this is a poor and sleepless poem' -
without goodbyes, with ill-knowledge,
with infinite regret, with the world undone -
(eighteen years and the world undone) -
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah



intolerable.


always, I thought, intolerable.
I cried intolerable, it was a sound.
it is intolerable to decide for or against death.
if I leave a house, I may or may not return.
things may not return exactly, but most often they may return.
death is intolerable. death does not return.
I may decide, I will harbor this animal, this person, this cause.
caring, giving, are implicated; sympathy, and perhaps empathy.
this is a tending, not a shepherding or stewardship.
or a mutual tending, shepherding, stewardship.
this is a continuity, this is constant.
the decision for death is instantaneous at the moment of death.
it is intolerable to make these decisions.
a decision for life may be revoked.
then, again, at the moment of death, implying already decided.
or that action or performative accompanying.
I saw the sedative administered, needle and catheter.
even then, I could have stayed that other, harboring the moment.
I went through with it into eternal darkness.
surely Boojum did not suffer, just as surely she wanted to live.
I made a decision, for her, and against her living.
for in the theater of steel, she resisted everything and strongly.
she defended herself, lovingly as usual, her claws withdrawn,
her mind full, commodious, insistent.
she defended herself, death was the last thing on her mind.
and we held her and tried to comfort her, she growled slowly,
and then lay down and then not at all.
it is intolerable to make these decisions!
one should kill oneself after such decisions! I am a coward!
one should not make these decisions!
for one universe has ended and why should another continue?
WHY?



re\play


this replay of abjection
is the playing-out of infection
beneath the aegis of dejection
somewhat tantric rejection
resulting from subjection
swallowed from projection
beyond a form's bijection
operated through surjection

useless wireless trope
against a brainless dope
darkling in a mope
there's nothing left of hope
impossible to cope
headless figures grope
tangled in a rope
crawling down a slope
they're given too much scope
elephants in a bathtub one says to the other please pass the soap
the other says no soap radio kind of introjection



success at last, just for a moment

it has been a difficult few days in the virtual environments laboratory. 
we moved most of the motion capture equipment to 109 to use, but couldn't 
locate the bvh computer (which receives signals from an old 486 used with 
proprietary hardware). the explanations written by the interns were miss- 
ing as well. we knew the bvh machine had to be around. we found an old 
dell and gary put windows 2000 on that, getting the key from another mach- 
ine. we put bvh software on the old dell, but the signals from the 486, 
which, it turned out, had to go through a router since we had no crossover 
connectors, were crashing it. so we were back to square one. i figured if 
i could locate a photo of the old bvh computer we'd used years ago, we 
might be able to use it to match with one of the bunches of similar units 
in 302c. i looked through archive after archive, until i located it; the 
image was slightly blurred, but the layout of the masking tape label (un- 
readable in the image) on top of the machine allowed us to narrow poss- , 
ible candidates to two. we found we couldn't get into either without pass- 
words. i discovered a scrap of paper in a corner of the room, 302c, with a 
password on it; it worked. so now we set them both up and one of them, 
which had been used as a projector connection to a virtual wall, was it. 
we brought the machine down to 109 and it almost ran; at least the soft- 
ware didn't crash. i found changing the antenna parameters for the motion 
capture and moving from ascii to binary and from tcp to udp did the trick. 
gary set up the 5100 port and addresses and we produced slomo.bvh as he 
moved the sensors slowly around; i wanted to duplicate the speed of the 
5-7 frames per second output of the 486, instead of working high-speed as 
i usually do. we brought the bvh file to poser on a compaq laptop which 
for some reason is now permanently misconfigured but usable; the result is 
which i quite quite like; if you ignore the hand fluttering, the movement 
is closer to what we need to work with at the moment. as far as the 
hand-fluttering is concerned, we're going to internally turn off the hand 
sensors by modifying the capture program, written in c, but with clear 
documentation; even a non-programmer like myself can get into it a bit. 
now to slow things down further so the inconceivable happens at the speed 
of amoeba-learning; in addition, to transform avatar into deity-emanent, 
following, introjecting yamantaka or one or another manifestation, moving 
mind and sheave-body into other realms far beyond 486, 2000, 109, 302c, 
5-7, until what ever may appear in the future brought quickly back to 
earth.



Railroad Club


Images from open house, Morgantown model railroad club, embodying cuts 
from one scale to another, from human to true world, from mind to emanent. 
Who would call this the postmodern? One might locate something else here: 
not the cut but the suture, not disparity but deep memory; the locales 
represented, real and imaginary, conjure the West Virginia landscape of 
the 1950s, in the memory of many of the club members. What better than a 
photograph than a reconstruction in which everything is punctum, intended?

The photographs are of the text, of this text; they're weaker without it, 
they go elsewhere, I'm pulling them back in. I'm pulling them back in to 
indicate multiculturalisms and emphases on locale and habitus tend both 
suture and division (these people, these others) in favor of _listening_ 
and its phenomenology.

But listening is skew-orthogonal, again, to the _style_ of the images, 
based on any number of photographers and trajectories.

Now what do I see when I do not know what I see? Certainly aspects and 
entities are present within the true world filtered through the history of 
photography and photographers who have no responsibility for me.

Where are the passengers in this life? Where are the passengers in the 
life of the other?

You can already feel the economy of the land, extractive industries, pov- 
erty, environmental pollution, mountain-topping, strip-mining, deep-min-
ing, feed stores, small towns in the hollows, grey dust, what's worn is 
worn, what's not is brought into play through deep memory's suture which 
even bends, transfigures the landscape, someday we'll all rise to the 
surface.

I will live forever
I will live forever
I will live forever
As a hungry ghost
As a hungry ghost
I will live forever

I don't remember the exact name of the railroad club or the members. Some- 
one named Mike, I believe, made the larger mine model. I came in as a 
tourist finding nameless things. the models were both outstanding, depres- 
sing to an outsider. The images appeared as images, imaginary, with what- 
ever context I might bring from the outside; the social depth was absent. 
I turned to the jump-cut.

The jump-cut was of the visual, that disparity of mind and scale. Railroad 
switching systems were fundamental to the development of the Internet. 
Evidence of electronic skein was everywhere. Jump-cut sutured into dream- 
scape, dream-screen, displacement/condensation semiotics. What is of truth 
or tending towards the indexical in the images applies as well to the vis- 
ual in general, compounding of memory, suture, cut, surface. Whatever one 
sees is surface, surface-only; x-rays report on deeper surfaces, 
translucent or transparent to invisible light.

The photographs bother me, as if theory needed image-propping beyond the 
diagrammatic. But what can the image hold, if not an arrangement that 
might be constituted as evidence? If a diagram is indexical or symbolic, 
the photograph resides elsewhere; evidence stands for nothing and hardly 
represents itself, nor is it pointing towards something across ontological 
or epistemological lines. On this level the photograph simply reports as 
Bazin might have it, on what-is, or rather the what-is and thetic con- 
strues within the dialog of image production. In any case, the postmodern 
is left behind, or rather, is relegated to analyses of socio-economic 
phenomena where the theory works wonders; think of postmodern geography, 
Harvey or Roja for example.

What would postmodern geography make of mountain-topping? And then its 
representation which makes the wrecked landscape somehow graspable, 
something to walk around, replant with meadow or pasture?

I think of tantra, mandala, Jefferey Hopkins' introduction to the Kala- 
chakra Tantra (Kalachakra Tantra, Rite of Initiation, Dali Lama, 1999). 
Hopkins walks/writes the body of the reader through the mandala ("Notice 
the entryway at the eastern door, wider than the doorway, with a three 
storied portico above the entranceway. Each of the stories of the portico 
above the entryway has four pillars across the front, thereby creating 
three room-like alcoves on each story. In each of these eight alcoves are 
goddesses of offering; the middle alcove in the first story on the eastern 
side has a black wheel of doctrine with a buck and doe to the right and 
left." And so forth.) Now think of the Morgantown railroad club images in 
the same or different shimmer, think not of the imminent/immanent identi- 
fication of entities within them, but of paths through or around or by 
virtue of these entities, which themselves are processes (one doesn't live 
forever, the tracks are constantly changing). Is there a meditation here, 
emission or spew that is sourceless except for (in spite of) the corners 
or frame of the image? Can one imagine a habitus, inhabitation? Is there a 
seeing that moves through memory near and far without the supplication of 
the signifier? This is what literally remains to be seen, and brings the 
essay to its clothes.


Anti-Crystal


Crystal radio apparatus set up in Morgantown, with main inductor coil of 
the honeycomb type. A diode and air-capacitor were used; these three 
elements constituted the original radio, with the exception of the diode. 
The antenna was coupled with a variometer and second air-capacitor, both 
old. The antenna was 90 feet long-wire wrapped around two sides of a house 
in a hollow. Reception on 1300 from a local station was so dominant that I 
attempted at all costs to avoid it, bringing hum and background into play, 
with mixed results. The whole was fed into a sound editing program for 
further modification. I attempted a democratization of the airwaves, 
allowing the power grid and other interferences their say. The result is
sculpted to be of sufficient interest in itself. This sculpting, like 
other aesthetic decisions, interfered with the original intent, but I do 
believe such interference constitutes the history of much recent art, if 
not certain schools of somewhat machinic poetics. For what is present must 
be presence, if presented, there must be a force behind it driving the 
efflorescence, there must be intention behind that force or a reading of 
that intention, there must be a consciousness behind that reading, there 
must be mind behind that consciousness, there must be confluence beyond 
that. What is here is confluence, for your listening and your listening 
pleasure.

'It is time some of you vain babies, who have a 'body beautiful' complex 
about your dancing, realize that an expressive body is more beautiful than 
an unexpressive one. But no, you fight distorting your body - even the 
least bit. If you won't, you won't, but your dancing will be shallow, and 
as empty as the baby stare some of you are cultivating.' (Horst)

'I'm not asking you to tie yourself up like a pretzel or grovel on the 
floor, but there must be some distortion if you are portraying even a 
slight case of mental malajudstment - a little inferiority or martyr 
complex.' (Horst)

'You can't drag an analyst's couch out on the stage and tell us about it. 
You have to express the mental with your body, so you distort the move- 
ment somewhat to externalize.' (Horst)

'All of them died on my red lips
In my hands
In my sexlessness
Which possesses all sexes
I am as pale as moonsilver.' (Anita Berber trans. Gordon)

'In every experience of every objective 'This' by every experiencer the 
female differentiating function is necessary, but so too is the male seed 
of unity, which supplies 'Being' from the side of the subject, the unitary 
consciousness of self from the side of the experiencer.' (Rawson)

'Why are so many boys and girls not erect? Look in almost any school and 
you see that many of the pupils, whether sitting or standing, are never 
straight. Heads are forward; shoulders double over a little, sometimes a 
good deal; chests incline to droop, and grow flat. Fine, full chests, and 
an easy, graceful carriage, are rare.

As the pupils get older, these faults, instead of going away, grow worse.

Can this be helped? Is there any way to make a crooked boy or girl 
straight? Take a slim, angular boy, for instance, whose father is round- 
shoulded and flat-chested--and perhaps his mother, too: can he become 
straight, like a soldier?' (Blaikie)

'The same [entity] does not arise from [itself], and how can it arise from 
another? Neither does it arise from both [itself and another], and what 
exists without any cause?' (Candrakirti, trans. Huntington)

'The singularity of specular reflections is demonstrated by the fact that 
if one tries to apply to them the schema of a communicational process mamy 
puzzling conclusions arise: source and addressee coincide (at least in 
cases where a human being looks at him or herself in the mirror), receiver 
and transmitter coincide; expression and content coincide since the 
content of the reflected image is just the image of a body, not the body 
itself; as a matter of fact the referent of a mirror image is pure visual 
matter.' (Eco)

The Beautiful Throbbed Emanentation


The following is a culmination of certain directions associated with mo- 
tion capture - in particular, operating too near and too far from the 
receiving antenna, with mixed sensors. In both positions, the configur- 
ation generates furious behavior as clusters of sensors shoot to ragged 
infinities and back again. Heads may detach and the cartoon integrity 
returns as such. The reading, however, is different, as is the jectivity; 
the reading is external, jectivity internal. The reading searches for 
coherency: which body belongs with which organ? Jectivity follows organ, 
head, and limb paths, identification with approaching, consummating, 
withdrawing, churning. This is Brownian motion, but radically integral. 

So what is being modeled? For one thing, slow-simple movement, carefully 
seducing, caressing, antenna and sensor alike. For another, electronic 
jitters which threaten to break apart the world. 

(This is some of the most advanced video/mocap work I've done; I'm always
amazed that both beauty and wonder can come out of such poverty. It's the
machines which are talking, which are rubbing against one another, which
parlay communication into visionary ekstasis. I must learn, I continue to
learn, how to listen, how to see, what is proffered, what is not within my
powers of conjuration. Magic is magic because it always come from the
Other. I have lost expectation.)

Violence, abjection, arousal, caress, tumescence, thickening, cutting of 
the sheaves. Sheave-figures which I am sure will soon be independent of 
our desire or construct.

Abjection is the most difficult. How to dis/comfort and fetishize, hold 
and release simultaneously. These emanants do this naturally, as Azure 
Carter, original model, follows suit.


Abjection is the most difficult, less so as the camera moves in, cuts
through sheaves. For the viewer there is the level of the subterranean bvh
code in dialog with the exigencies of Poser models, but there are also
levels of organs and affect, and it is the breasts and hands, high-speed
maternal display, that provide tremulous scaffolding:


graphic used interface


constrained and smeared temporally and spatially
swallowing time, swallowing space
body used and wounded, sutured
sound smeared fore and aft

both say everywhere everywhere
both say everywhere where are you i'm hurting
both say everywhere where are you i'm saved



outline of emanent research (current work at wvu, written 1/18/08)


(note while the notions of 'code,' 'coding,' 'decoding,' codework, 
underlie almost everything below, they're not explicit - nor are the 
actions of reading and writing. the actions can be considered emergent 
phenomena, and the notions as primitives in the sense of members of a set, 
etc. again, the analog and digital phenomenologies are implicit as well, 
as are the (related) concepts of abjection and purification. the analyses 
of these comes out through praxis, attention to detail, thinking through 
mandalic structuring until the scaffolding leads, not to silence, but to 
tending. this should be clearer as the work progresses.

i should note that the following is both a constitution of my usual/cur- 
rent directions and most likely too ambitious. the trajectories circulate 
around formal systems and their psychoanalytic/psychological receptivi- 
ties, around emanents and 'true worlds,' around edge phenomena which turn 
towards the uncanny and abject, around languages, bodies, sexualities, 
communalities, and inhabitations. i have increasingly worked through 
buddhist philosophies, the analogic and digital at the limits, notions of 
'dis/eased' philosophies, deathing and uneasy worlds. now that i have a 
clear time to think through these things, the outline below is useful as a 
guide; for that matter, it's a guide to the past few years of the 'inter- 
net text' as well.)

I. motion capture: this conjures up external behavioral characteristics 
translated into internal processes (penetration, scale, displacement, 
torsion, according to various geometries). think of mocap behaviors 
operating within a constrained field with strange attractors / catas- 
trophic jumps. continue to develop mocap with new multi-valent sensors
and software rewrites:

1. turning nodes on and off
2. combining nodes
3. mathesis such that node1 = f(node{n not = 1}), or such that 
   node1 = recursively f(node1)
4. multivalent sensors such that sensor(x) = sensor[{n}]

what are the emergent images here?

what is the possibility of constructing bvh files with additional nodes 
determined mathematically from the hardware set? or mathematically from 
extraneous data?

what is the possibility of other organic models (i.e. than human or
animal forms)?

IA. data remappings

entry of bvh files into blender:
1. modeled onto abstracted forms
2. modeled onto parent/child forms
3. modeled onto metaball forms

blender file outputs:

1. entry into cave environment: static or dynamic
2. video output
3. what is the possibility of gaming output here? (moving around emanent 
   environment)
3. second life output: static or dynamic/interactive
   
IB. interiors

1. standardized interiors: sheave-skin, sheave-organism
2. constructed 'model' interiors: solid, transparent, penetrable, 
   impenetrable
3. abject fluxed interiors: how should these be constructed?

IC. interior narratologies

1. abject/purified narratologies and emanent interactions 
2. abjected/purified contents of dis/ease, dis/order, ecstasy, ekstasis, 
   catatonia, defuge, death/immobility, sexuality, speech/murmured/
   whispered/cried/screamed, body formed/deformed 
3. tantric/middleway theoretics

ID. choreographic mocap (see above)

1. additional issues of jump/leap, exhaustion, tether
2. video/photographic output as well as bvh

II. scan

phenomenology of scanning, causality across scanned lines

IIA. small scanner

1. head/speech phenomena dissected
2. schizophrenias and beam-splitters
3. reflections from coils, air condensers

   combinations and splits
5. wounds, scars, lips, genitals, ears

output into .obj files into blender/cave
output into video/still image files

within blender: solve the issue of disappearance/transparency

IIIB. large scanner

1. interior scans: rooms with bodies, reflections, dance-studio,
   scan-choreographies
2. exterior scans at bretz coke ovens, persona rapid transit (in motion), 
   soccer fields
3. mobilized body scans in inert environments: reading 2d -> 3d, nature of 
   the inference.
3. environmental scans with mobilized and peripheral bodies
5. narratologies of such bodies: violence, chase, jump/fall, etc.
6. choreographic narratologies

III. access grid (open source internet 2 group messaging/environment)

1. distant interaction with emanents
2. readings of the corporate / corporate bodies: photographs/video
3. theory and discussion, levinas, leder, lingis, etc. at the distance
   of telecommunications

IV. cave and second life

1. performance and documentation
2. working/running within emanent interiors
3. and so forth

V. goals of the above:

1. what does it mean to be in-carnated within the real/virtual/
   true world?
2. what are the edge-phenomena/plastic and static limits of the body?
3. of the geopolitical body? of the political-economic body?
   performance: abu-gharayb modeling in sl
   performance: abu-gharayb modeling in choreography
4. what are the signifiers of bodily arousal/violence/meditation?
   how are these constituted within the real/virtual?
5. readings: what does it mean to read the real body? the virtual body?
6. what are the ontologies and epistemologies involved here? 
   ontological status of the so-called virtual -
   schrodinger's cat paradox and collapse of the wave function as model
   for simultaneous analogic/digital readings -
   seeing through microscopy (tunnel, scanning, optical, etc.):
   are ontology and epistemology equivalent at the limit?
   (are analogic and digital equivalent at a parallel limit?)

VI. medical model

1. internals and externals, static/dynamic. remnants of the visible 
   human project, gendering of the visual/internal 
2. comfort, dis/comfort, ease, dis/ease, hysteria and abjection/fluid-
   ity (laycock's 1840 essay on hysteria, kristeva, chasseguet-smirgel)
3. dis/ease, hysteria, and so forth of emanents
   distorted emanent behavior and body image (gaz)
   distorted surface textures and behavior-collisions (sondheim)
   distorted worlding, 'bringing one out of the true world' (etc.)

VIIIA. praxis of edge/boundary phenomena

1. analogic and worn emanent boundaries
2. edge / boundary phenomena - physics and psychophysics of the game-
   world edge in second life
3. phenomena of the sheave-skin and sheave-skin internals
4. phenomena of medical models in relation to edge/boundaries

VIIIB. praxis of edge/boundary phenomena with hardware/software 

1. edge phenomena in literature, codework, mathesis of the text
   (cramer's and reith's programs)
2. edge phenomena within the motion capture software, poser, blender,
   calculations for example of sin(tan x) as tan x nears the
   asymptote
3. generalization of edge phenomena into the dialectic between tacit
   knowledge (polyani) and error (winograd/flores)

VIIIC. live choreographies: 

1. foofwa and soccer (edge phenomena, dancesport, etc.)
2. foofwa with crystal radio, vlf radio, etc. in large field
3. sexuality of ballet (nude ballet, classical or genre figures),
   gendering of roles, ballet as emanation

   of the machine

IX. world-constructions

1. what constitutes worlds? constructing?
   world of the text, inhabitation/dwelling/building (heidegger,
   dufrenne)
2. what constitutes the true world? worlding?
   'true world' in which lines/angles are 'trued' (affine geometry),
   'true world' in the sense of 'trued' phenomenologies within which
   virtual, real, and ikonic are blurred and interpenetrating, somewhat
   equivalent, and within which traditional epistemologies of symbol/
   sign/signifier/signified/index/ikon etc. break down (kalachakra
   tantra, jeffrey hopkins)
3. 'reading' underlying (substructural, configuration files, guides)
   organization of mocap/scan through surface phenomena
   (and the relationship of this reading to waddington's epigenetic
   landscapes)
4. who is world? communality, consensuality?
   the problem of other minds and the problem of consensual other minds
   (group hallucinations, vijnanavada, dwarf sitings, ufos, etc.)

X. outputs:

1. video and film (in practice, usual issues of apparatus/spectator)
2. digital and silver photography (digital/analogic and analogic/digi-
   tal divides - potential well on one hand, grain on the other)
3. series of short papers/descriptions
4. series of performances (individual and collaborative)

   anywhere across virtual geographies
5. formal presentations at wvu (spring and perhaps fall)
6. formal presentations elsewhere



Writing and Wryting

[Written for an online class at DMU]

I write daily and when I'm not writing, I'm thinking about writing or 
writing in another medium; the world is a world of inscriptions. At one 
point I believed there were signs, that the world was inhabited by 
signifiers which might or might not have referents; now, after looking 
repeatedly at tantra and the casting-off of whatever was found and 
impeded, I think signifiers might be nothing except residues of a kind of 
frisson, the world rubbing up against itself. Whatever codes there are, 
and however these codes are manipulated -


they're not the only story, or rather, they _are_ the story but that's 
nothing - what's going on in the world isn't story at all. We tend to make 
scripts of things around us - that's how we get along. For example, 
there's the restaurant script (and this example of course isn't mine) - I 
enter a restaurant I've never been in before, but I know exactly what to 
do; there's a restaurant script and subscripts; we don't make it up 
immediately - that would be far too costly - but rely on constructing, 
memory, reconstructing, and so forth, and there we are, eating together. 
And it's eating together, because scripts, like the world, are consensual 
and build community.

Somebody said something like aye, there's the rub of it - and that's it, 
precisely; the world rubs one, _worlding_ is a form of rubbing - which 
makes virtual worlds such as Second Life all the more perplexed, where 
rubbing and any physics has to be _intended_ by someone, a programmer, or 
nothing would happen at all. Still, in second life, one might have bodies 
or rather one might _inscribe_ bodies with writing, and this body writing 
I call _wryting_ and it occurs in the real world as well. For example,


where avatars conform and display to one another, and all these behaviors 
are automated from written files called bvh files, which give an indica- 
tion of how virtual worlds are in fact a kind of writing. Here is part of 
a bvh which produced what you've seen in throbbed:

This gives the initial positions of the body; later, there are tens of 
thousands of numbers that give the node movements from these positions.
Do note that this is an ascii, a text file, and not a binary, not an 
executable; the file is executed by a program that uses it as data. In 
this sense, the virtual world is always inscribed, digital, just as the 
real physical world is not written, but _is,_ and is analog, and tends to 
wear out. Nothing wears out in the digital world, and while avatars - what 
I call emanents - need electricity to run, they don't need food. Still, 
given that, I think that for a conscious mind, a mind used to dreaming, to 
projections and introjections, there are no real differences between the 
virtual and the real, and there's dreaming, proverbs, tales, stories, 
poetry, poetics, hallucinations, hypnagogic imagery, meditations, and the 
like to show that. 

And even though the real physical world isn't written, it's full of 
writing and our bodies themselves are always already written, inscribed - 
full of tattoos, scars, burns, abrasions, wrinkles, salves, perfumes, 
calluses, and so forth. I think it's from these things, particularly from 
scars, wounds, abrasions, scrapes, etc., that language descends - that 
language is first and foremost a reading of the history of the body, that 
the body, the physical body, carries its own primordial memory upon it. 
That's important, since it's this memory, these scarrings, that bind us to 
the earth, to the world, the analogic. The digital is constructed from 
that with a bit of a help from the corporate, from political economy - the 
digital rides and infuses poitical economy in fact. So there are digital 
standards for sampling, for encoding and decoding and checksums and so 
forth, and these guarantee that a parsing of the world in one part of it 
can be a parsing of the world in another. Think of the digital as an 
extrusion, and think, even, of writing as _always_ digital or at least 
always discrete, one symbol differentiated from another, from the other, 
as all of them together generate meaning within organism and conscious- 
ness, generate culture.

An aside here to the effect that _culture is all the way down,_ that any 
organism has culture, has learning, has the symbolic, has the digital (in 
the sense that catastrophe theory prescribes and describes certain sudden 
shifts in behavior or states which might as well be digital, that is _on 
and off switches_ operating within potential wells, that is a level above 
noise which allows them to function. Recent experiences in fact demon- 
strate amoebic memory, even within this one-celled animal without neurons 
or nervous system. It's important to think throug this, to see the world 
as not only processings but also culturings - if you do that, a very 
different kind of world emerges. 

So where does codework or digital writing come into play here? One might 
begin back with culturing - that the world is replete with poetics, that 
it makes real, concrete, sense to speak or think of the poetics of the 
real - that this isn't just metaphoric. And then one might proceed fur- 
ther and realize, within the analogic the digital resides - that the 
analog harbors splits and leaps, as the collapse of the wave equation or 
annihilation of virtual particles shows. And within the digital, there's 
the analog as well - the potential well upon which the digital rides, 
literally, let there be no mistake about it. 

So one might ride the digital as well, perceive the digital as an extru- 
sion from the analogic, or a residue, or a system of signs which for the 
most part are produced by humans, according to human conventions and 
protocols, for example, the tcp/ip structure or protocol suite of the 
Internet - and if not this protocol suite, another or an other. Then one 
writes here, in this medium, in this temporarily electronic medium (for 
there might be other sorts of transmission in the future, who knows? or 
other sorts now for that matter, literally for that matter). And within 
the digital, in which bits bite bits, every pixel, every character, every 
moment of the digital is independently accessible, and every moment is 
deeply ruptured, disconnected, from every other. This is why the digital 
is inherently untruthful; there's no truth within it, since manipulation 
is complete and replete within every file, every domain, every protocol, 
every instantiation in fact. There are no lies, either, and if there are 
narratologies, these reside in sememes embedded or encoded within the 
digital, interpreted by organism, often human. In creating in such an 
environment, one plays god, or at least deity (in the tantric sense); one 
constructs out of nothing, and if I write the phrase, as On Kawara might, 
"I am still alive," these letters are, at a very fundamental and concrete 
level, completely independent; I could just as well write "lkurj llisihg" 
or anything else, literally, again, for that matter, and for the sorts and 
sortings of that matter. 

Well, I can write anything, I can say anything. And some of what I write 
just lies there, and some is performative, in the sense that, if I type

k3% date
Sat Jan 19 01:13:23 EST 2008

at the k3% prompt, the date is returned - the word is not just a word, but 
an action, a process, an operation inherent in the reading and writing of 
it within an operating system. Now if I type

k7% lkjsfug
ksh: lkjsfug: not found

as you can see, it's still performing, but the operating system is looking 
for a meaning or decoding and can't find any or rather finds a kind of 
null-decoding which is based on absence. So that electronic writing, with- 
in a terminal window is always a performance; it's never static. And it's 
not only a performance, but also a communalit, since there are others who 
may well be present, even though invisible, uncounted, and unaccountable:

for example are running around on the same machine I am, and I'm aware of 
them, even though I don't know who they are. I can find out what some of 
them are doing:

for example, but I'm not informed as to the semantics involved, only the 
protocols, the surface syntactics.

So one might see codework as a mix of all of this, a kind of dirty or 
abject combination, a kind of rupturing, of surface and depth, one 
producing another or an other, a kind of drawing-out of the fecundity of 
the world and its structure, its poetics. This combination or drawing-out 
reflects the real unclarity of what I call the true world, which is the 
real and virtual world interpenetrated, intermingled, diffused, effused, 
as they are for us, no matter where we think we are, in first life or 
Second Life or what I call third sex, which is online sex, as if there 
were a first or second, which there aren't. 

Beyond this, I'm not sure what codework is, even though I've invented or 
discovered the term. Here is a program Florian Cramer wrote for me, called 
eliminate.pl (it's in perl):

#!/usr/local/bin/perl5

while (<STDIN>) {
        @words = split /[\s]+/, $_;
        @spaces = split /[\S]+/, $_;
	for ($x=0; $x <= $#words; $x++) {
                $word_count{$words[$x]}++;
if ($word_count{$words[$x]} == 1) {print $words[$x],$spaces[$x+1]}
                }
        }

This is based on the Thousand Character Essay, written in Chinese around 
fifteen hundred years ago - an essay in which each character is different 
from every other; each character, in a sense, is primordial, individuated 
- an extreme nominalism. Although I don't know Chinese, I worked with a 
friend laboriously translating it. Anyway, I wanted to duplicate this in 
English - use a program in which each instance of a word appears only 
once, that is, at its first (and only) appearance. Within this, the fol- 
lowing are still distinguished: "word" "Word" "Word," "word-" and so forth 
since these have different ascii renderings. Here is part of this very 
essay rendered with the program:

my writing

I write daily and when I'm not writing, thinking about or in another 
medium; the world is a of inscriptions. At one point believed there were 
signs, that was inhabited by signifiers which might have referents; now, 
after looking repeatedly at tantra casting-off whatever found impeded, 
think be nothing except residues kind frisson, rubbing up against itself. 
Whatever codes are, however these are manipulated - they're only story, 
rather, they _are_ story but that's what's going on isn't all. We tend to 
make scripts things around us how we get along. For example, there's 
restaurant script (and this example course mine) enter I've never been 
before, know exactly what do; subscripts; don't it immediately would far 
too costly rely constructing, memory, reconstructing, so forth, eating 
together. And it's together, because scripts, like world, consensual build 
community.

== Now this is at the beginning of the text, and clear, but see what 
happens towards the end:

$word_count{$words[$x]}++;($word_count{$words[$x]} == 1) {print
$words[$x],$spaces[$x+1]} }Thousand Character Essay, Chinese fifteen

translating Anyway, wanted duplicate English use instance appears once,
only) appearance. Within fol- lowing distinguished: "word" "Word" "Word,"
"word-" forth ascii renderings. rendered program:

== Here, towards the end, the condensation is extreme. One might think of 
this in terms of the biblical book of Genesis - and one of the first 
things I did was to render Genesis with the program, which resulted, 
again, in a kind of _Vac,_ word-creation, creation-word of a primordial 
sort. I think of this as codework, since, reading it, it becomes clear 
quickly - what is happening, what the structure is - even if the code 
itself isn't present except as a disturbance upon another text, an other.
This becomes clearer, perhaps, when the program is applied to itself:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl5
while (<STDIN>) {
 @words = split /[\s]+/,
$_;@spaces /[\S]+/,
for ($x=0; $x <= $#words; $x++)
$word_count{$words[$x]}++;if ($word_count{$words[$x]} == 1) {print
$words[$x],$spaces[$x+1]}}

== Now I don't think of this as a 'better' example of codework than the 
first example, even though code is evident here; it's just another sub- 
ject for the performative maw. 

A point about interactivity: Every writing, wryting, upon reading or 
sensing, scenting, is always already interactive; the inscriptive is never 
_linear,_ no matter the appearance of lines. Memory, remembrance, is at 
work, scanning moves backwards and forwards, moves in chunks, and even 
syntax tends to jump about, leap. There is of course an active interactiv- 
ity, in which the reader/scenter is required to _do_ something concrete, 
within a repertoire or potential series of actions; hypertext is perhaps 
the simplest example. I've not been so interested in that, and my lack of 
interest has to do with worlds and the false appearance of choice; I'd 
rather have the running of inscription and meaning go on about without 
interruption, as the world goes on about one, even though one seems to 
have choice within it. This stems to some extent from my interest in film; 
I've never been carried so far in a hypertextual situation as I am when 
embedded in the cinematic other which is also the self, selving. The world 
is complex and I attempt to deal with that complexity and its perturba- 
tions, attempt to deal with the surface codes of the world. This isn't a 
manifesto on my part, and in fact, I've produced interactive work as well, 
particularly in simple Visual Basic, but I'd rather the interactivity 
occur elsewhere, within consciousness.

Here are some links. First, to the most recent series of texts:

pm.txt - here you'll find all sorts of things, from a report on an 
airline's first attempts at wireless en route to the derivation of 'bug' 
(as in software or computer bug), to the kinds of code early telegraph 
operators used, to... a google scraping piece on 'bush fucks' to... an 
elimination piece featuring my Facebook superwall. These texts are 
'thicker' than many others, and they're stressed - we were mov- ing 
temporarily to West Virginia, and our companion cat of 18 years had to be 
put down, which was one of the most traumatic events of my life. At this 
point, pm.txt is somewhat diaristic, although most of it isn't.

These are part of the Internet Text, which I've been writing since 1994, a 
continuous meditation on the above and other subjects. If you look at the 
earlier texts, for example:

http://www.alansondheim.org/net1.txt - you'll find a clearer form of expo- 
sition than much of the later work. Since this is from 1994, the Net is 
very different, mostly what I call 'darknet,' referncing lower ascii and 
terminal windows as standard, instead of the current multi-mediacy. Almost 
from the beginning, I wrote through avatars, other characters, who really 
weren't other at all (see my file-in-progress, 

http://www.alansondheim.org/pn.txt - for an account of the research I'm 
doing in this direction).

This is about it at the moment; as you can see, there are gaps, errors 
(which I'm interested in), disturbances, in the account. On another, an 
other, hand, we can proceed from here, I'm sure.

And thanks for this opportunity -

I met my Baby, out behind the Gaz-Works


You don't often think of your body unless you're thinking of your body. 
It's there and even when you think of it, you're incarnated, presenced. 
You're presenced all the time. Sign off Second Life and you're gone. 
That's the ground state, disappearance. In SL your bodies intended, 
there's nothing given but the slate. Whatever is added parallels cinema 
and the mise en scene - nothing is left to chance unless chance is 
determined, built-in. But it's the projections that fundamentally 
characterize it - introjections from SL body to organism, projections from 
organism to SL body. Think of this as jectivity, an uncanny relationship 
which escapes determination, which flirts with abjection. The SL body is a 
body that is witnessed, except for the somewhat clumsy 'mouselook' which 
places you within it; the mouselook eerily bends the landscape while the 
framework monitor remains static. There's always background going on in or 
within/without SL; jectivity operates through a normalization that behaves 
as dream-screen - for jectivity to occur, the SL/organism interface must 
appear coherent, cohering - an inhabitation or dwelling beyond building. 
Gaz breaks through this in a way that would be illicit in the world of 
organism, of course; pulled or distended limbs in the latter would be a 
form of torture or death. One might still speak of self-image and perhaps 
drugs which alter it, even the appearance of the physical scaffolding of 
the organic body, but Gaz does this with what one postulates, again as a 
kind of background radiation, as a normal state which is a state of 
absence.

All of this is too neat and I'd argue further a few things - first, that 
body and mind are always already both 'real' and 'virtual,' the computer 
monitor appearing within this almost as afterthought - and second, that 
culture, which is interlaced with intentionality, occurs all the way down 
and across - not only from amoeba to, say, bird (with destructive humans 
halfway across this continuum), but also from carbon- to silicon- based 
lifeform which would include both amoeba and computer, if not the internal 
combustion engine. I speak of spew and emissions - of signifiers which 
ride across and above the surfaces of what's really going on - the true 
world - and it's these signifiers that are subtextual operatives within 
Second Life and art- or culture- working in Second Life, which is coding, 
coded, recoding, writing, rewriting, and wryting itself constantly - 
wryting being the implicit inhering relationship of inscriptive to the 
body, bodily inscription and inscriptive body coalescing and coalesced 
from the very beginning.

Think of edges of worlds and bodies; Second Life adds two new constants: 
height (evidenced in flying) and gameworld boundaries, for example at the 
bottom of the ocean where everything is transformed, and moving forward 
out of the gamespace results in asymptotic returns to the interior. Camera 
movement can distance you from the avatar; one can move within, beneath, 
above, within her. There are at least two positions of inherent interest. 
In the first, the camera leaves the avatar altogether, in order to peer 
beneath the gamespace or elsewhere across forbidden zones, and in the 
second, the camera appears within the avatar body - a view that brings the 
sheaves/prims to the foreground, not goreground, as the avatar dissolves 
into empty space. Gaz' reach extends, appears to extend, of course it 
doesn't and can't, outside the gamespace altogether (a point in an expand- 
ing universe is still within an expanding universe) - this is an inversion 
of a caveworld, transformed into private plateau. Again the physics are 
odd, exposing the Second Life universe as non-isotropic whatsoever - as a 
construct within which worlding occurs and within/without which the true 
world operates as it does, ontologically and epistemologically, everywhere 
we are, can think of, within and without jectivity.

Now there are issues of entrapment, reminiscent of current RIAA stuff; Gaz 
insists that one's body in Second Life is not one's own, and that jectiv- 
ity in the same is only artifact, in fact mitigated by Linden Labs, at 
best. S/he's a gadfly or parasitic (in Serres' sense of cultural producer) 
about the game (as one is a man or woman 'about the town'). So one's 
behavior in the vicinity of a Gazwork, gasworks (think of Bhopal) is not 
one's own, either; the distortions and entrapments, the weighings-down, 
are not of one's making, but of one's wandering into a work such that the 
wandering becomes the catalyst or primordial state of the work.

Not always, but almost always, avatars are smaller than one's physical 
body, or appear so. And one's viewpoint is not always, but almost always, 
above and behind the avatar, slightly raised - as if one's watching a 
soccer game, which for a spectator can be senseless from a ground-based 
camera. I think this kind of miniaturization tends towards a maternal 
reading of the world, a reading within which the image on the screen forms 
a safe matrix; after all, the computer goes on and off, games and software 
are replaced or updated, and both the world and you go on. So here's this 
safe world, and jectivity or what one might call the 'jectivity-braid' - 
the braid of psychoanalytic renderings, readings and writings, introjec- 
tions and projections, dreamings and hallucinatings, all before or within 
and without the screen - this braid is taken for granted; it's the safe- 
house of the world, transforming the world and the true world into a 
habitus. As a result of peering and miniaturization among other things. 
And the ability to chat and keep or erase chat. And the ability to fly or 
teletransport, playing into Freud's condensation/displacement in the 
dreamwork. Second Life is a _pun_ in this regard - one place quickly sub- 
stituted for another, and such substitutions revolutionary or disrupting 
as one landscape disappears, another appears - perhaps throwing everything 
off but just for a (very safe) moment. It's the safety in punning that 
makes them revolutionary, and the same safety occurs in relation and 
through the braid. So again, when Gaz takes a meta-position in relation to 
this relation, when Gaz appears apparently half-in and half-out of the 
gamespace, the disruptive becomes difficult to absorb, becomes something 
that doesn't happen in the real (except perhaps with sado-masochism and 
the use of safewords which break out of one theater into another). It's a 
contradiction which can't be absorbed. And to return to one's "own" avatar 
body after Gaz' distortion, one logs out of Second Life - in other words 
out of the fundamental world, what is _being_ the fundamental world - into 
another world with its real dangers, etc. - the world of the inert or 
'idiotic' real (Rosset).

So that the space-time slice within which your body is distorted must be 
abandoned. So that one returns and in this return, like the prodigal 
daughter or sun, the body is made w/hole again, just like in the MOOs and 
MUDs and various adventure games which are the history of all these spaces 
and WOW and whatnot. (I want to mention briefly my own work here, which is 
concerned with inconceivable positionings of one's own avatar, position- 
ings within which behaviors pile on behaviors, creating 'behavior colli- 
sions' that create, for the viewer (distinct from the performer), a 
disturbing and/or dis/eased representation of the body, an abject body 
that indicates something else other the normative is occurring, something 
that can't be absorbed. With Gaz, this occurs first-person - the change is 
to _me_ and my image/imaginary; with my work, it's third-person and in a 
sense stains or transforms the mise en scene into something abject and 
unexpected.)

To conclude on a mundane note - There are two things that distinguish Gaz' 
works as well as Second Life, and are critical for contemporary theory, to 
the extent that contemporary theory is critical. First, the latter: When- 
ever people talk about an experience in Second Life, they talk as if 
they're _in the world_: "I just wandered around and didn't see much." "I 
talked to some people and a bird flew overhead and grabbed me." "I was 
teleported to the Odyssey Gallery and saw an amazing work there, well, not 
actually _saw,_ but experienced." "I kept looking for someone but all I 
found were empty spaces." And so forth. So the _experience_ of SL melds 
with experience otherwise (or the same), and this doesn't happen with 
other online experiences, except of course games and other social spaces. 
We adapt quickly to the screen, we're braided to the screen, and this 
permits the creation of artworks and environments that simply have no 
parallel elsewhere: "I entered this house and it flew away." "I turned 
myself from a forty-year-old man into a sexy twenty-year-old." "I couldn't 
get lose from the bird until I logged out and in again." "I was buried in 
paintings." "Records played by themselves." "I flew." We say these things 
as if they're everyday, as if they were always possible. "Question-marks 
were falling everywhere." Sometimes the servers are hacked or slowed up, 
but even this can be absorbed until everything grinds to a halt, and then 
one just logs out, waits, logs in again. This logging-out/logging-in has 
become an integral part of SL, in fact, just as online/offline otherwise 
is integral to being in a post-industrial world. (I do want to point out 
that this isn't, naturally, the only world - the world outside the matrix 
or braid is characterized by intense poverty, local wars, starvations, and 
so forth, and SL is powerless in relation to these; one might argue in 
fact that SL is too much of a safe haven, that it detracts from real 
praxis and real difference in the true world. And there's truth to this.)

The second, related, thing in conclusion, is Gaz' works themselves; as I 
pointed out above, the behaviors they trigger couldn't occur outside 
gamespace without bodily destruction - and some of the behaviors couldn't 
occur at all. So these behaviors, these works, are absolutely unique in 
this respect; they depend on both a reading of the SL environment as 
'natural,' and a scripting within and of that environment to produce the 
'unnatural' which is still read as natural. These works, on this level, 
question the authority of the real, of the idiotic real; they're a kind of 
critique that couldn't exist anywhere else. The viewer/participant isn't 
prepared for them. (UPS trucks falling on one!) So one engages both crit- 
ically and psychologically/psychoanalytically - the works create both 
contemplation and affect, in ways we're not used to. And that, at least 
for me, is one of the highest goals of art - to create that sense of 
dis/comfort that gives us a place to question everything, and to return 
from that questioning hopefully wiser. On a personal note, I can't say 
I've found anything as intriguing as Gaz' works, anywhere, and for a long 
time, and I'm still fathoming out the implications, still feeling the 
limbs extended almost to the breaking-point. Gaz is a pioneer in the body 
and space of the Other - and perhaps nothing more need have been said than 
that.

elaboration: immunological processes based on body identification 
 (organism) and database stability and stable addressing of whole and
 parts (emanent).
consideration: relationship of dis/ease and disease/hacking. identity
 maintenance occurs within absolute fluidity; with organism, motility
 and bodily changes (disease/death/exhaustion/dissolution/decay/
 extinction/mutation etc.), and with emanent, 'remakes' (new textures,
 bodies, accouterments, etc.), corporate transformations (economy,
 merger, dissolution, etc.), and interest/disinterest/defuge in
 relation to maintenance.


culture - remembrance and communality + (history of interactivity)
elaboration: organism - culture occurring 'all the way down,' with
 internal/external memories/storage/data-processing/quantum and
 molecular, etc. memory and communality inhere. emanent - relation-
 ship of external (organic) or internal (digital) mind to avatar
 _steerage_ (which is intentional).
consideration: mind inhabits organism inhabits mind; inherence is
 primordial, backgrounding. there is a complex relationship between
 this inhabitation and issues of health, disease, death, etc. - issues
 that simultaneously reify and parcel the body, and a turn towards 
 moments or places/spaces of body (pain for example) that call for 
 tending. there are qualitatively different tendings for organism and 
 emanent; it is a matter of time before they coalesce.


negation - circumscription of an other + (avatar interactions, 
 game physics)
elaboration: circumscription sends the other to the pale; structures
 gesture and language, transforms ikonic into indexical. 
consideration: semantics of avatar boundaries on a subtextual level;
 semantics of organic boundaries on the supra-textual. the latter is
 ikonic, the former, indexical. (perhaps there is no place for the
 symbolic in the midst of emanents and organisms.)


consumption and excretion tropisms (energy flow)
elaboration: evanescent organic life as abject spew, continuous
 breathing. a stationary emanent requires no energy; a stationary
 organism continues its tropic behavior.
consideration: nature of the tropism, energy-seeking, pollution-
 fleeing. direction of emanent irrelevant; energy comes from external
 steerage.


variegated metabolic processes (chemical, quantum, atomic)
elaboration: striations and differentiations within organism. 
 epistemologically, organism transforms internally and externally
 from horizon to horizon; emanent possesses epistemological
 equivalence (substance) and differentiation occurs in syntactics.
consideration: herbert simon's nearly decomposable hierarchies;
 differentiation in organism occurs on the level of the phoneme.
 emanent and organism meet on the plane of semantics, sememe.

-- absorption and excretion
elaboration: or circulation, necessary for organism, and only for 
 emanent in the sense that mind requires circulation (as do
 computers in terms of cycles, energy-flow, etc.). 
consideration: note in all of these instances we're considering life
 in terms of the _metabolic,_ flux-processes, remembering, identity,
 recognitions, tropisms, negations, perceptions.

-- reproduction 
elaboration: organisms most often self-reproduce through one or 
 multiple generations; emanents do not. organic emanent minds do
 but not electronic emanent minds, do not. 
consideration: reproduction is not necessarily a constituent of
 life - dreams of the loch ness monster point in another direction.
 and there is always the exhaustion, punctum, of the 'last of a 
 species' or reproductive pool, which is becoming more and more
 common. say that reproduction temporally smears the organic while
 identity spatially restricts the organic.

----- carrier image (reproductive plan, layout) + (template)
elaboration: reproduction is haunted by the organism to be, whether
 template or internal processes.
consideration: with organism, reproduction is always already uncanny;
 with emanent, reproduction is canny. with organism, internal and 
 with emanent external, steered. the emanent is always already
 hallucinatory, which is not to say inexact or 'unreal'; its model
 and modeling are elsewhere. let us say that the emanent is freed
 from reproduction but an emanent class is bound to steering mind for
 continued existence.


maintenance of interiority
elaboration: what goes on inside, stays inside, is maintained inside.
 for organism this includes temperature control (or adjustments to
 non-control); for emanents, this again is a matter of contiguity at
 best.
consideration: wounds close, bruises heal, diseases disperse; there 
 is an ideal at the back of organism, backgrounding organism, as if
 primordial (and when i use 'primordial' here, i mean nothing meta-
 physical, only primitives, backgroundings, against or within which
 everything else occurs). nothing immediately with emanents, but a long
 time ago, in irc (internet relay chat), netsplit would occur, and
 members of coherent communities would be cut off from each other -
 there would for example be two, not one *love channels. it would be
 of interest to think through the metabolism and political economy
 of irc channels and channel communities as organisms.


biome and niche maintenance (immediate vicinity cleanup)
elaboration: what happens outside the body of the organism, more or
 less in the immediate vicinity (think of potential exceptions such 
 as albatross or plankton, bring them into the model by including
 mobile niches, evanescent biomes). emanents also tend to control 
 their immediate vicinity; sl avatars will have a 'home' teleport
 site, will fly to a certain height, will be admitted or not to 
 restricted territories (and may create restricted territories of
 their own). 
consideration: mobile niches within evanescent biomes are of great
 interest; they reflect the potential of taz (temporary autonomous
 zones) and extend the concepts of home and territory - the latter
 might be considered a personal niche, and the former, that biome
 which provides a necessary degree of comfort for its species and
 occupants. different species may connote different biome 
 definitions which overlap and are displaced from 'human geography'
 and its defining characteristics.


contiguity of body or bodies + (substructure of sheave-skin)
elaboration: organic body held together by skeletal (internal and
 external) structures, skin and muscle, etc.; the sheave-skin held
 together by parent-child relationships and restrictions on size
 and angle. contiguity is complex with sheave-skins; importing a
 bvh file into blender requires hand-setting the parent-child
 relationships, and motion capture models permit extensions and
 topological remodelings of these. generally organic bodies are
 topographically defined; there are physical restraints to size, etc.
 while emanent bodies are topological, once 'set' into structure by
 node assignments. again, the latter reference external steerage.
consideration: this external steerage of emanents is mapped in
 various ways - through mind and gui or other interfaces, through
 virtual reality interaction software, through software itself which
 may operate emanents autonomously, so that the emanent becomes 
 nothing more than an output display of a program epistemologically
 other. of course this may change in the future; there is no reason
 why emanents should not be autonomous and locally-so, so that 
 steerage, communication, etc., is part and parcel of the emanent
 software, integral to it, inhering. 


regulated, homeostatic communication
elaboration: organisms and emanents are nodes, channels, transmitters,
 receptors, codes, encodings, decodings, part-objects and their per- 
 ception, skins and sheave-skins and their perception. to the extent
 that regulation occurs, cohering semantics emerges; to the extent
 that noise or parasitism enters the systems, transformations and
 possible mutations occur, beneficial or destructive, possibly inher-
 ited or not (and the latter, with emanent mind-steering, becomes to
 some extent an issue of conscious choice).
consideration: one begins to approach a _plasma model_ within which
 forms flux, and flux forms, stases are imminent and always in the
 process of forming and dissolving; memory is primordial (in the
 above sense). 

-- internal and external + (between mind and emanent)
elaboration: internal processes are homeostatically regulated in
 organism; it is moot whether such occur in emanents except to the
 extent that _emanents are inherently part of the gamespace, do not
 ontologically exist other than as gamespace._
consideration: external communication - one might bring issues of
 data-bases with both organism and emanent, steerage, community and
 individual memory, community and individual hallucination, etc. it's
 here that language comes forth as the mutual orienting of cognitive
 domains (maturana); while one might speak of the cosmos as languaging
 and only languaging (epistemologically and ontologically), one might
 also conceive of languaging as ikonic in terms of the primordial,
 the thinging of language, or language grounded (as in electronic
 grounding) in things. in this sense, language is literally an after-
 thought, shape-riding.

-- emitters and receptors (within and without organisms)
elaboration: sm (sado-masochist/abject) maws/fits/misfits,
 the contradictory transformed into the contrary or wayward.
consideration: emitters and receptors are in-line, online, bought
 into line vis-a-vis codings. without emitter and receptor interfaces,
 languaging doesn't happen; one might think then of emitters and
 receptors _themselves_ as ikonic languages, so that sign-flows are
 fundamental (but not symbols or indices).

---- emitter and receptor codings (entranceways and exits)
elaboration: entrances and exits but also molecular or protocol 
 structures, sm touch/scent/contact. information must obey etiquette,
 otherwise it's noise. etiquette touches on the aesthetics and
 efficiency of coding. _coded emanents have no code_; their code is
 external steerage, subtextual beneath the surface, in the dis/splay
 of sheave-skin.
consideration: it's important to think through analog/ikonic and 
 digital/indexical here. organism code is ikonic to the extent that,
 for example, dna coding _is_ molecular, while emanent code is
 indexical since to some extent programming languages are interchange-
 able, they're teleologically drawn-out to steerage goals, and they
 form/construct a performative layer which runs the emanent directly.

---- domain orientations (tropic turns towards energy, communication 
 potentials)
elaboration: organisms are tropic, turning towards, away, or skew-
 orthogonally; emanents are tropic through camera positioning (without
 the camera, emanents are invisible, non-existent, which are not equiv-
 alent) within the aegis of mind.
consideration: cameras move emanents as residue, dejecta, abject stain
 on occasion blocking the field of view. 


pollutions and abjections (body disposal, chemical slough)

-- purifications and expulsions
elaboration: this operates on the epistemological if not ontological
 dichotomy described re: kristeva, douglas, etc. organisms are channels
 and flows; the flows channel, and the channels flow. the abject is
 integral to organism, just as purification and expulsion may be 
 integral to emanent.
consideration: this may be far too simplistic, but it's a step at 
 least. when the true world is considered, emanent and organism are
 interpenetrated, intermingled, formed and in/formed together at the 
 limit.


emanents and avatars inhere, cohere, mishmash, spew, emit, slur, slough, 
intermingle, interpenetrate, within the true world, they are true-world- 
ing, in a sense mind-only, but only in the sense that steerage is always 
present, from language through metabolic process through retinal process- 
ing, immunological defense systems, heartbeat, hormonal maintenance, soft- 
ware updating and replacement, membrane filtering, and so forth. this is 
_not_ life force, but inherited and inhering organization in relation to 
reproduction, within which the carrier image is but a dream, our dream, 
our presentification of the future anterior.

(elements marked + pertain in particular to emanent/avatar process. note
that in the above, 'emanent' and 'avatar' are to some extent equivalent, 
although the latter is mostly reserved for entities within second life
and other online/offline 'virtual' worlds.)



this ungainly one.

over a half hour at top speed, I wanted to see what happens with extended 
improvisation bound to permanent rhythm. with a rhythm of steel ferrules. 
hot notes beckoning. what happened that I saw was severe carpal tunnel in 
my right wrist and elbow. it was close to impossible for me to play this 
fast for any length of time. so i thought; now my hand and arm shake with 
jabs of pain. you can hear this occasioned at

Messay: The Mess of the True World


This text is culled from an outline of current work prepared for my re- 
search group at West Virginia University (Virtual Environments Laboratory, 
Center for Literary Computing), Morgantown, WV. Questions dealing with 
substantive content were taken in the order they appeared, and embedded in 
the following m/essay. Topics again center around issues of the 'true 
world,' emanents, medical and other modeling, avatars, organisms, know- 
ledge and its management. The relative disorderliness reflects the disord- 
erliness of the world, or so I hope to believe - not an inherent defect in 
messay style.


 what does it mean to be in-carnated within the real/virtual/
 true world?

Carnated/carnal/knowledge - We could begin by introducing the true world, 
the world of mind in relation to ontological/epistemological shifting. The 
true world is primordial, in other words backgrounding.

..."however, we use the word [_materialism_] in its dictionary definition 
of _embodiment,_ in contract to _mind._ Thus, virtual reality, as dis- 
cussed within the art literature [...] is materialist, regardless of 
whether this experience is _real_ or _illusory._ Mental constructs, on the 
other hand, are nonsensory and so have no material existence." Paul Fish= 
wick, An Introduction to Aesthetic Computing, in Fishwick, ed., Aesthetic 
Computing, MIT, 2006. In this sense, the true world is materialist; how- 
ever I would argue that mental constructs cohere with the sensory, that a 
fundamental entanglement exists. For example, love or hate create sensed 
bodily transformations, mathematical thought creates the sensation of per- 
ceived 'symbol-clouds,' and so forth.


 what are the edge-phenomena/plastic and static limits of the body?

The limits of my body within the true world are the limits of my world; 
here I include ontological shifts such as mathesis, semiosis, emotions and 
the like. Given the limited bandwidth of receptors of all sorts, and the 
limitations of mind (for example, in thinking through the appearance of 
the eighth dimension, calculating, speaking non-native languages, etc.), 
thought and the true world are based on extrapolation - the _gestural_ - 
as fundamental being. (See Tran Duc Thao on the origins of language.) The 
gestural follows quantum non-distributive logics (see the early experi- 
ments by Land on color vision), not Aristotelian distributive logics; this 
being-in-the-world is partial reception of part-objects transformed into 
inherency through gesture. All organisms have this in common.

The _plastic_ limits of the body are the limits of body-inherency, whether 
'real' or 'virtual' or other category - the limits of the image carried by 
the jectivity (introjection and projection) braid. The _static_ limits may 
be considered formal-measurable limits, whether in one or another space.


 of the geopolitical body? of the political-economic body?

As soon as one brings domain-extrapolation of the body into play (i.e. 
sexual body, material body, imaginary body, natural body, and so forth), 
cultural nexus is paramount, and the body itself moves within theory as 
phenomenological token or punctum.

And as soon as one brings variegated ontologies and epistemologies into 
play, analysis becomes a mush/mess/mass or miss. Terms slide against 
terms, carrying enormous overdetermined histories with them - but these 
are the only histories there are.


 what are the signifiers of bodily arousal/violence/meditation?
 how are these constituted within the true world?

Herewith bee a liste of signes, or some such. But where is the arousal, 
violence, meditation, if not brainward, wearing the exposure, softening, 
hardening, quiescence of the body which simultaneously is foregrounded and 
absenting. In terms of emanents, the signs are symbolic; one calculates, 
applies them. In term of organism, the signs are ikonic, upwelling. The 
brain manages none of this; the brain manages, is managed - everything 
becomes a mess as inquiry tangles uselessly. It's this uselessness, this 
nexus, that is of interest - an analytical failure in the close-rubbed maw 
of the world.


 readings: what does it mean to read the real body? the virtual body?

One might begin by considering language as fundamentally ikonic, that 
within the preconscious ('repository' of syntactics, short-term memory - 
another metaphor) language is clothed, associated with the true world. 
Language then is structured like the unconscious, and the unconscious does 
not necessarily splay the real. Bodies, organic and emanent (and 'organic' 
references the machinic phylum as well), inhere to mind, minding, tending, 
a posteriori interpretation and hermeneutics. Reading the body is embody- 
ing, is against the background of incarnation. Sheave-skins need not react 
or appear to sense as organic skins; the feedback is often visual or 
aural, not proprioceptive. Within the jectivity braid, this is an epistem- 
ological issue, not one of fundamental locus. On the other hand (real or 
virtual), one can abandon the emanent; abandoning the organic is deadly. 
Proceed backwards from this, from the irretrievable, intolerable, finality 
of death, and reading bodies, and bodily risk, become wildly disparate. 
Nevertheless both inhabit the true world, mind inhabits both, albeit often 
in qualitatively different manners, depending on ontology.


 what are the ontologies and epistemologies involved here? 
 ontological status of the so-called virtual -
 Schroedinger's cat paradox and collapse of the wave function as model
  for simultaneous analogic/digital readings -
 seeing through microscopy (tunnel, scanning, optical, etc.):
 are ontology and epistemology equivalent at the limit?
 (are analogic and digital equivalent at a parallel limit?)

What difference does it make? Begin with the mess, with the corrupted 
reading of whatever consciousness has placed there, on the page, the rock, 
the emanent body, the organic body. The last carries ikonic signs, 
simultaneously indexical, pointing out the mute history of the being. If 
there were only readers of everything! If only the book of nature existed! 
The Ladder! Great Chain of Being!

Ontologies occur in local domains, rub raw against each other, problema- 
tize each other. Who decided this one or that one as primordial? What's 
fundamental is the mixed mess, the braid. At least as far as we're con- 
cerned, the braid.


 internals and externals, static/dynamic. remnants of the visible 
 human project, gendering of the visual/internal 

Human skin under the microtome, sheave-skin burrowed into by camera 
position. Here is the necessity of Madhyamika, co-dependent origination, 
depend co-origination, braided mind, image, imaginary, entity, real and 
virtual within, inhering to the true world. Striated, variegated trans- 
formations characterize life; the Visible Human Project transforms 
organism into emanent, habitus into data-base.


 comfort, dis/comfort, ease, dis/ease, hysteria and abjection/fluid-
 ity (laycock's 1840 essay on hysteria, kristeva, chasseguet-smirgel)

Clearly the abject lies within the primordial, the braid is braid of 
dissolution, corruption, decay; definitions flux in relation to the 
constricted passing of time. Organisms flood themselves, emanents decay 
with their corporations, software updating, diminishing dreamtimes as 
elders die off. Hysteria is convulsion, but also spew, contrary and 
wayward, the refusal of the body, just as death is such a refusal and 
catatonia. Do others refuse the body? Use it? Reuse it? Are sheave-skins 
exchanged? Does political economy depend on aegis?


 dis/ease, hysteria, and so forth of emanents

Dis/ease, etc. may be modeled; turning the emanent towards abjection is 
necessarily a conscious decision. The hysteria of emanents is the hys- 
teria of the steering mind. Proliferation of emanents, duplications and 
other hacks, may be considered a form of hysteria. But hysteria is on the 
surface; emanents which are autonomous or semi-autonomous agents may exist 
the full range of symptoms, generated from within, without external 
steering.


 medical model and technology

A medical model implies internal flows, striations, identities, vulner- 
abilities, immunological defenses, maintenance and so forth. Emphasis is 
on the cohering of parts, membranes and molecular channels. Organism runs 
from within; emanent runs from without. An emanent may be defined as _an 
image or apparition whose body and mind are elsewhere,_ an entity that 
exists in relation to the jectivity braid, and has apparent, but not 
genidentical, identity. Of course the organic body itself is genidentical 
only to a limited extent.

One might say then that both ontologically and epistemologically, _an 
emanent exists within data-bases or other entities spatio-temporally 
distant from the visual or other residue._ What we see is surface, but 
surface from both within and without. _The dissection of an emanent image 
is the result of camera angle._


 psychoanalytics and technology, psychoanalytics of emanents

The psychoanalytics of emanents are two-fold: the psychoanalytics of mind 
steering, and the internal psychoanalytics of the machinic phylum. Or 
three-fold if the former is also embedded within/embedding the psycho- 
analytics of organically-embodied mind. I would begin with Freud's 
metapsychology, since it's illusory clarity allows the possibility of 
equivalence, attribute classes, and the like. I would attach this model to 
one of drives and instincts dealing at least in part with homeostatic 
maintenance (which I have covered elsewhere).


 analogic and worn emanent boundaries

How does the emanent wear? How does it wear the analog? For an emanent to 
_wear,_ an ontological shift must be crossed, the wear occurring in hard 
or flash drive, in the material world of atoms and quantum probabilities. 


 edge / boundary phenomena - physics and psychophysics of the game-world 
 edge in second life

Psychophysical remapping of (motion, behavior) steering phenomena. What 
else to say here? Camera views must be independent of emanents; they move 
beyond, behind, below the sheave-skins, constructing visual feedback of 
morphed transformations. For a moment nothing is autonomic, everything is 
relearned. But there are asymptotic behaviors and motions at the edge of 
every game-world, behaviors simultaneously permitting approach and refus- 
ing escape. The game-world edges harbor autisms, palsies, deconstructions 
- chatterings which take on the guise of everyday life, just as everyday 
life elsewhere within the game-world might well take on these chatterings 
as style or news from afar.


 phenomena of the sheave-skin and sheave-skin internals

Sheave-skin externals read as internals: anatomical mappings within Poser. 
First that the visual mappings are just that, indexicals, residue, from 
codings, reports from another frontier, that of the software processes 
themselves. Second, I have pointed out elsewhere that sheave-skin and 
environment, visuals, all exist within the same ontological habitus; the 
split is between this habitus and deeper discrete or digital processes. 
The split is absolute ontologically, constructed epistemologically. If 
there is an Absolute in sheave-skin or game-theory or game-world, it's 
this ontological split which even a representation of software processes 
cannot penetrate: from electron-movement and process configuration/deploy- 
ment to visual/aural/tactile/etc. appearance - the gap is permanent, 
imminent, and therefore uncanny.


 phenomena of medical models in relation to edge/boundaries

The medical model is for learning, for analogy of surface to surface. The 
medical model requires a (human) viewer. Any dissection into the substance 
of an organic body results in exposed and constructed surfaces; interiors 
always lie elsewhere, revealed by X-ray, MRI, and so forth.


 edge phenomena in literature, codework, mathesis of the text

In a sense all writing is edge, phenomena of the edge; writing exists as 
surface, sheave-skin, emanent. Inscription coats the orgasm of things, 
constructs both things and orgasm, wryting into the body of the true world 
helter-skelter. Codework in this regard is mute, ikonic; code and text 
scrape one another, none dominant, both structured and structuring.


 generalization of edge phenomena into the dialectic between tacit
 knowledge (polyani) and error (winograd/flores)

At the edge, the world is manifest between lived experience and corrup- 
tion, between trial and error, between inhering/cohering and construction, 
between dwelling and building. into the forest of error, where does the 
body go? From the edge, one can look back or down, into the windows of the 
comfortable houses across the street - if one still has the capability of 
sight. Is the edge sharp? Does the world cut? Is the edge equivalent to 
death, both blank, beyond, both miasma of theory and practice? Think else- 
wise of the possibilities of worlds of closed manifolds or recursions, one 
repeatedly returning, to something in the vastness of space or mind. and 
then think, what a construct, what comfort, and to what regard, what proof 
or results, what Signs?


 what constitutes worlds? constructing?
 world of the text, inhabitation/dwelling/building (heidegger,
 dufrenne)

It's too simple to insist on worlds cohering, or that within their do- 
main (ontological, epistemological), there is closure. One might say that, 
for all intents and purposes, worlds are nearly closed, that blurred boun- 
daries are distanced, rarely in evidence. The construction of worlds is no 
more or less problematic than the construction of anything at all. A world 
is characterized by inhabitation; a world is a homing.

The world of the text forgets its coding, its double-coding. Without that 
forgetting, erasure, the text is anomalous, problematic, non-cohering. The 
willing suspension of disbelief begins within the absence of will; will 
returns when the text ends or fails.


 what constitutes the true world? worlding?
 'true world' in which lines/angles are 'trued' (affine geometry),
 'true world' in the sense of 'trued' phenomenologies within which
 virtual, real, and ikonic are blurred and interpenetrating, somewhat
 equivalent, and within which traditional epistemologies of symbol/
 sign/signifier/signified/index/ikon etc. break down (kalachakra
   tantra, jeffrey hopkins)

'Worlding' references ongoing inhabiting and making of the (true) world, 
inhabiting memory, making and dwelling in memory, the truing of the world. 
All worlds are not true worlds, all true worlds are worlding. ikonic signs 
inhere within the true world, reading bodies (organisms, emanents, approp- 
riated, misappropriated) are ikonic, true world, the body stands for 
everything and nothing; ikonic, the body stands in for the body.


 'reading' underlying (substructural, configuration files, guides)
 organization of mocap/scan through surface phenomena
 (and the relationship of this reading to waddington's epigenetic
 landscapes)

Oh, one has to read the cinema I produce, held taut through diagram and 
substructure. Reading here involves decoding, retaining the decoding 
against the memory or remembrance of absent code. There are epigenetic 
landscapes of decoding, tendencies and tending of the true world sending 
the reader one or another wayward or contrary way. Landscapes lead toward 
coagulation of landscapes, tethered desire of inhabiting an other. We 
can't let go of ourselves, even to read; we huddle, in order to write.


 who is world? communality, consensuality?
 the problem of other minds and the problem of consensual other minds
 (group hallucinations, vijnanavada, dwarf sightings, ufos, etc.)

We can't answer this. We can't answer this without further future know- 
ledge in terms of mind. We have experienced, at least once, the connect- 
edness of mind, but to generalize from this is problematic. I have no 
doubt of minding the world, minding the world of minds. And that one time 
may well have been untoward coincidence. Certainly "who is world?" is a 
proper question to ask, emanent and organism alike entailed. And certainly 
we are all emanents, and certainly we receive differently from different 
skins, tissue-skins, sheave-skins, molecular-membrane-skins, one-pixel- 
thick-skins, true world of inhering/cohering skins. It is not communality 
or consensuality that beg definition, but their absence: what cause the 
illusion of individuation, the lived discrete?


At this point, defuge sets in, the intolerable directing of the messay 
increasingly turns towards entanglement; nothing is answered or accounted 
(nothing is accountable). What to do but abandon the true world to a 
certain trembling at the edge - an edge which increasingly moves towards 
an unknown center (the real edge where damage begins). And what to do but 
abandon this attempt at another accretionary formation or inscription, 
living in the world as-if there were a certain human, if not organic, 
order. As-if is the pleasure of our senses and disfigurement of slaughter, 
as if these were speakable between the axle and the rim (the spokes, too, 
have their gaps). Let it go. Do let it go.

Why, Hello Julu! And so good to hear from you! Yes, this is a theme that 
has occupe ied me for days and days , most of them recent. For example, 
what were "electrical recreations" and more to the point, what might one 
say about the relative simplicity of the apparatus used for them?? Metal, 
the material world, puckers and withdraws, all is spheres and spikes. Ah 
but conditions or situations, environem ments, material ecologies, the 
very splay of the real? In such a fashion
 metal declares itself.Yes, and how you have filled out these many years, 
lovely Julu! Thus de uring the era of steam-engines and diplex telegraphy 
- and one must remember that the most of the nineteenth century ran on 
batteries, not electrical outlets - during this era, electrostatic 
generators were constructed of nothing more than rods, circular plates, 
god knows what else...The illustrations of the time for the most part 
indicated what? Young women, such as ourselves, in touch with metal, 
standing on stools with glass legs, carefully applying dischargers with 
rubberized handles, it was as if the real were out of contrl---Or Until, 
dearest Julu, one mght speak of that sudden discharge, the orgams sm, the 
sudden exaltation of teh he spirit, for we might have concluded then, that 
spirit itself were inhabiting the world, a kind of ectoplasm of the 
metallic. Matter spoke and no one listened.However (as our words and arms 
entwine), it's as if there were a surplus that couldn't be contained - the 
experiment of electrocuting the dog for example, or creating the semblance 
of hydrogen/oxygen explosion. Which surely is why the models were young 
women , with the demonstrator male, the demonstration of the male, 
dis/splay. , which is why we are torn together as one, sundered together, 
across electronic ab barriers, 

which surely are the remnants of those electrostatics, those "electrical 
recreations" as we would have them ourselves...

--------------------------------= talk =--------------------------------


Hello Nikuko and you are how? I have been very busy, reading about the 
electrical apparatus, electrostatics and dynamic electricity, from the 
late eighteenth century, perhaps early to mid-ninteenth century. To be 
sure, what a mix of worlds here, electrical theatrics, young men leading 
young women into circular frenzy, controlled, I do forget how beautiful 
you are, your wet skin, tissue against mine, minds blurred, the 
discharges, phenomena Dionysian, the apparatus Apollonian - cleansed, 
purified, perfected, holding charge back -I remembver your orgasms, your 
body against mine, matter speaking and no one listening for that matter: 
the audibility of the world was all bound up in the visible, even the 
electrostatic parlor tricks resulted in sounds and sights, the ontology of 
what was taken for granted as real. This isn't science, this is the 
ikonic; we might as well leave the indexical far behind. There are no 
pointers, no measurements, with all of these phenomena, just phenomena 
themselves, as if the world were talking, but talking mutely, drenched in 
our passion, against our skins and minds.Which perhaps the young women 
chose to ignore; I'd imagine they'd choose to ignore it, and which is why

yes, as we would have them, and have us, and have at them and ourselves...



screams and cadence


listening to CB radio in Morgantown, the first, breaker2, is an odd 
melange of screams and cries - filtered in breaker2filter. I imagine these 
are taken from a film or produced in some audio program; they're frighten- 
ing. the breaker1 is a sequence on channel 6 with the dead air edited out. 
I'm fascinated by cadence and rhythm here. I'm working with 02 radio, 
short-wave, scanning, vlf, low frequency, crystal, listening to anything I 
can receive. our place is hampered by a location in a small hollow near 
the middle of the town - too much interference from the power grid, not 
enough radio visibility. On the other hand, the screams, if screams they 
be, came through loud and clear.



Electronic writing, approach


Electronic writing is always protocol-based and always dynamic. Keyboard
strokes signal interrupts, the screen-image is constantly refreshed, fonts
are interchangeable, links and animations may be present, the text may be
updated by the original author or modified by others, the text might be
deleted once and for all, or temporarily deleted, or duplicated and
transformed from one to another site, or printed out hardcopy, or faxed,
or entirely transformed into another medium - audio, steganography, online
or offline calligraphy, and so forth. The text is fluid, inherently
non-canonic, every instance is equivalent to every other, every instance
is original and plagiarism. The text is burdened by apparatus from ebook
reader to desktop, cellphone to electronic billboard. The text requires
maintenance, electrical current, to continue its electronic presence. The
text requires the transparency of protocols to be present, presented. The
text requires an interface from electronic hardware-software circuitry to
visual or other presentation. The text requires busses or connectors from
one component to another, and from internal electronics to display. The
text also requires data storage, and encoding/decoding as well as the
potential well of checksums and other means ensuring minimal errors. If
the text is transferred from one hardware medium to another or one file
format to another, it requires interoperability - an interoperability
which leaves the surface of the text relatively inviolate. The text
requires data storage which itself exists within a physical potential
well, producing the semblance of at least momentary stability. The text
requires light or sound or haptic or other sensors. And the text requires
a relatively stable input environment, within which the interrupts are
apparently operating smoothly, transmission is relatively clear from
infractions or appears clear from such, lag is sufficiently small and the
buffer sufficiently large to give the writer/programmer/artist at least a
degree of illusory autonomy.

Let us not forget that machines, habitus, economy, are required. That the
stability of signs and sign systems are required. That mutually understood
sememes are required. That languaging among a community of more or less
speakers/writers is required.

The text itself, per se, requires nothing. Nothing is required unless com-
munication, beyond the communication of error, anomaly, distortion, annih-
ilation, creation, exchange, displacement, condensation, theft, hack,
repetition, meta-transformations or meta-signifiers based on the bracket-
ing of the text - unless communication based on at least the semblance of
interiority, is desired; in this sense the author is ghost, wraith, close
to invisible beyond, beneath, the text, perhaps present at the birth of
the text or system or links of text, and perhaps not.

And this list, drawn from apparatus, habitus, text, language, economy,
catastrophic and stable regimes, may be extended or diminished - the terms
are variable, problematic; the 'worldview' stemming from the true world is
equally problematic.

Nonetheless: The text, and one might of course argue that each and every
text is always already dynamic, that such is the nature of communication,
written or spoken or otherwise. Still: One might or might not make a
distinction between traditional texts and those that are up for grabs in
relation to electrical and other dynamic forms of reproduction, whose
outputs are also dynamic, at least to the extent of redrawing/rewriting/
rewryting the image or text or social/creative internal and external
content and positioning of the text.

Now further, what is it that we teach, that is normally taught, if not for
the stability of the canon, or stability for that matter of jodi.org or
other entities and projects and productions or producings which are not
stable whatsoever but are part and parcel of literature today, however such
may be defined? Unless literature is confined to the printed page, in which
case it is also confined to a relatively small corner of electronic- social
life today, that is, confined to a relatively small and perhaps irrelevant
corner of life itself. So perhaps it is time, and of course in this
space/place I am preaching mainly to the converted, to teach litera- ture as
a residue or heartland of the social-technologic, as a production of desire,
at least to the extent of the desire to be produced, in rela- tion to
literature as theory or language or other artifacture? In spite of the fact
that theory is essential to hermeneutics and the reception of literature. In
which case, literature might be approached top down, or sides-in, lateral,
so that, for example, the existence of the external flash drive,
conveniently plugged into a machine for extra memory, operat- ing system,
creative software, text repository, would be inherently part of the
questions: What, how, why, when, where do we write? Where are our writings
deposited? What hope do we have for their survival? What about _this
particular text_ within this particular environment - a momentary housing at
best? What about momentary housing? Obsolescence? And so forth?

From a related discussion with Sandy Baldwin, Frances van Scoy Azure Carter:
Given the above, what are the software issues themselves? What are the
textual or graphic or other interfaces employed? What are the esthetics of
those interfaces? Since every interface both transmits and filters, what are
the conditions of transmission, and what is filtered out, what artifacts are
added in? Is the interface considered an object or a process (continual
updating of beta, name+number (Quicktime 7.4 for example), is it purchased
or free, open or closed source? What is the user control over the interface
and what is the interface's control over the user? (For example,
user-specified fonts may override monospaced fonts in a text apparently
involving graphic-ascii or other presentation.)

Further, there are phenomenological issues related to traditional media, to
media in general: What is the genre-lens we're using in reading/looking
at/processing/hearing/etc. a text? What is the history of the genre? Of
genre? How does genre relate to canon and is the text considered canonic? Is
it considered a finished text, an object, a process, an unfinished text, a
variorium, an ur-text, a meta-text, a critique of another exemplary text, a
system of procedures or modules or sub-modules? Further, is the text
considered part of a cycle? Of a community of texts? Written by one or more
authors? Is the user part of a community of users, for example a book club?
Was the text written for a community or specific community? What theory, if
any, is used to approach the text? What is the text's relation to that
theory? To theory? Who wrote, programmed, created, tended, the text? Is the
text interactive, reactive, stationary, mobile within the interface,
apparently within the user's control, out of the user's control; does it
alter the interface framework, collapse or appear to hack into the
framework? And is the text designed to be read/viewed/ heard/etc. with a
particular viewer in mind? With a particular person or group or groups of
people?

Finally, is electronic writing textual? Can one speak of an 'electronic
text'? Is electronic writing _read_? Are there other ways to approach it?
(Is electronic writing an 'it'?) I want to argue against canon, genre,
static or state approaches, I want to argue in favor of a general field
phenomenology of organism, inscription, inscribing, emanent, machinic and
other phyla, wryting and other processes, I want to think through no final
solutions, no stages of consciousness, no conclusions, no edifices, no
thing, other and no other, I want to argue against this messaying, this
lack (what did I forget, what did I leave out, what have I gotten wrong,
what don't I know, what did I express poorly if at all?), I want to argue
against argument, I want to argue the favor of your

Important Things


Our house likes in a small depression in one of Morgantown's hills; as a 
result anyone can see into it from above We keep the shades drawn at 
night. Around midnight last night, two white males 20-25 knocked on the 
door of a house on the next block, broke in, beat up the residence with a 
tire iron or crowbar, and stole whatever. Someone might just part behind 
our house in the alley, work his way up the side to the porch, wreak 
havoc. My body's temperature regulation has always been off, but is worse 
than ever here, and I've had slight fevers as a result. Our cat Ossi 
Oswalda makes our house feel like a home. There is no red spot on my desk, 
no flock of blackbirds, no waiter against which I measure myself, selves, 
and the world. The basement of our house is dark, but there is no pile of 
rope which might be mistaken for a snake, or a snake which might be 
mistaken for a pile of rope; instead there are familiar things and we find 
our way round in the dark. We are frightened of Bush and M. Cain; there is 
no esthetics to our politics, which are weak theory tending towards TAZ. 
West Virginia has the highest prescription drug rate per capita in the 
country and it's out of control; I argue with my 'health care provider' to 
get basic medicine. No one has stolen our copper telephone wires to sell - 
they bring fair money - and I gather some drugs, which we are not on, cost 
between $60 and $80 per pill. A letter I wrote to the Dominion Post was 
published, decrying the efforts of someone on the state legislature to 
teach gun use and safety to school children; the idea is to revive the 
local hunting population, which is on the decline. I visited a friend of 
mine five minutes after his mother-in-law was given last rites; she is 
still alive and spent six hours last night calling out apparently random 
numbers. The atmosphere creaks with tension. Changes are about. I will 
reread the Diamond Sutra. The small scanner computer in the lab began 
screaming this afternoon; it wouldn't stop. We opened it up and found the 
fan burned out, everything red-hot. We took a fan from another computer 
and so far things are working out fine; I scanned Siva and vajra. Our 
friends in Bruceten Mills might have weather damage; the area was hard-hit 
and a dam broke last night. Ossi Oswalda is dreaming again. I picked up 
Boston on the crystal radio. It's night.

Against this I think of important things, or against these things, some of 
which are important to me, I think of things which might be ultimately 
important. Of course these aren't things, but events, happenings, and 
there is an entire literature about the distinction between the two - a 
distinction which is slippery at best and which requires at least a rather 
coherent idea of a rather coherent space-time, against which all things 
are measured. Or not, for one might well take into account fuzzy logic, 
the asymptotic behavior of strange attractors, and the general miasma of 
the real world. And who is this 'one' taking this into account, taking 
anything into account, if not for a 'one' who is fearless and healthy, or 
at least tending towards both? For the philosophy of important things is 
by and large taken up from the position of health and equanimity; while 
one might not write lyric poetry after Auschwitz, philosophy stands firm. 

What would a philosophy of important things, which are not things, from 
the viewpoint of ill health or mental disturbance - what would such a 
philosophy look like? We might turn to Levinas' existence and existents, 
or some of Lingis; we might turn towards subaltern philosophy or libera- 
tion theology; we might embrace those who write with their backs to the 
wall, as if the Resistance were a model for truth distilled against a 
desperation of everyday life and the occasion of that desperation. We 
might turn further to philosophy of the sick-bed, to tantric embrace of 
death by those still alive, those dying, those already passed. We might 
discuss emptiness and the vast sweeping that occurs in Madhyamaka phil- 
osophy - and in the philosophy of 'the Buddha from Dolpo,' Dolpopa Sherab 
Gyaltsen, who emphasizes a kernel of absolute truth, two modes, not one, 
of emptiness. Or we might insist that emptiness is of no consequence and 
no occasion, and is not important, or the least important, but then what 
is one's attitude towards rebirth and cyclicity, which I believe are at 
best medieval concepts? Turn back a moment towards that absolute, or any, 
or any other, and one might find safe haven, a harbor, a ground, a primor- 
dial existent or backgrounded, a chora for example, out of which good 
things occur (one might also think through the idea of 'the fragility of 
good things' in relation to the bad at this (empty) point). One argues, 
speaks, thinks, within the background just as one exists within the 3K 
background radiation of the universe: it's there, not as dark matter might 
be, but as the dimmest consistent illumination as the cataclysm of cosmic 
birth spreads out, presumably forever. We're heading for the dark, but 
will never quite reach it - an opposite of absolute zero, it is the place 
or space of the greatest weakening of all. 

Absolutes frighten me; I cannot imagine a guru, authority, presence, to 
which I would give myself, even in the light of incandescent knowledge. 
When I look at important things - being, nothingness, foreground, life, 
death, absence, presence, creation, annihilation, motion, language, ikon, 
symbol, index, chora, self, selving, others, worlds, true world, worlding, 
beings, essence, existence, safe-harbor against home invasion, healthy 
temperature regulation of the body - they don't disappear upon scrutiny, 
they don't divide, they're not solved or resolved relegated to dependent 
categories, they're not illuminated by continued and permanent analysis or 
therapeutic. They shift and are messy, their boundaries meld into other 
melding boundaries, their skins are sheave-skins which themselves turn out 
to be protocols and elemental manipulations. Below all, they're abject, 
neither here nor there, neither one thing nor the other, embodiments of 
dissolving Sheffer-strokes and their duals. When I look at important 
things, my analysis flees from analysis; it is the analysis of flight; of 
exile, but exile on the move; of refuge, but temporary at best; of dis- 
course, but against the futility of speech, languor of language, loss of 
memory which haunts us from before and after our breathing lives. Import- 
ant things are neither in the absolutes or categories, nor in the details; 
neither the forest nor the trees; and neither the gesture nor the proto- 
col. They are not things. They are withdrawals, puckers; they are the 
austral and boreal currents among earths and metals in various states of 
weather and decomposition. 'When I look at important things, my retina and 
its processing.' I might say this writing is a refuge from the night, but 
what night, what refuge, what writing? All of my writing, perhaps, and all 
writing, perhaps, writing on the wane.



important things ii


in 'Important Things' i initiated the move from a poetics of everyday life 
to a deconstruction of absolutist philosophy; the tension between the two 
plays out in life, text, image, sound. the experience of the body is the 
body, the experience of the body is anything which can be reflected, any- 
thing which cannot be reflected. our death is a sign we cannot speak. your 
death is that sign of speech, that sign which is any sign. my death is a 
sign i cannot speak. we meander among signs and voice do we not?

in important things i began the project which appears as the object of 
anita berber. ghosts exist and this is as much in evidence as anything, 
anysign. let us think of anysign as the bending or devolution of sign;
the sivaj below are just such a sign.

anysign is neither singular nor plural and replaces anything in the true 
world, just as anything in the true world replaces anysign given the 
ikonic thud of sign, voice, body, text, image, sound, life. 

life is emanent life and tissue-skin emanent is sheave-skin organism.

Leon Brillouin in Science and Information Theory, quoted in Patrick 
Meredith, Instruments of Communication: "There is obviously a certain 
expenditure of energy in the process of writing, but we find no trace of 
the energy on the written page. There is no visible negentropy left 
either, yet the information is there, completely dissociated from these 
other elements."

then reading is the coagulation-energy from the anysign catalyst which is 
a pharmacopeia of the real. and then anita berber chora-choratic wanders 
anysign. withdraw the name and the real puckers and withdraws; fluids 
circulate, and it is clear, among less important things, that 'object of 
anita berber' construes a proper name only in its abandonment. anysign is 
crutch, any utterance prosthetic.

Aalan, Baff buff boff, do you so? I squander your humort! Ah no regard!

Poor furmort consideration! Jump on me top of me!
I think of murth-mouth who was here just a moment ago...
<jumps up and down furiously on the chair!>
Can you beat that?
To what extent is this like you? Can you beat that?

On top of a mountain no less! <gestures>

Yes, well, that certainly is the case. <gestures>
What am I doing!?

<gestures>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nikuko! Boof biff basf baff! I squinch your dotted line!

Hippit top of a mournin! Rotate! Rotato!
Can you beat him? Every day a new slogan and someone has to plunder
the code. First the reds, then the blues! For the life of me!

<gestures>
<gestures>
You had better believe it! <gestures>

You're drawing a blank!

poetics of the interior with any means possible, Nikuko tells me important 
things and these silent videos / images are both tawdry and fecund, their

all day i sit at this fucking screen, not fucking
but the brain's left hemisphere's twitched and reamed
again with crystals shunting cells decayed and sucking
out the last dim landscape i might have ever dreamed .

fingers stall, breath couples hard with chills
against a bandaged mind and damaged brain .
no longer shall i climb that landscape's hills
and turn towards tarn shined dark with bloody rain .

i'm born here, died here, screen looms, the world is flat,
dead animals pour from sour skin, i shake
for something else got wrong then right, a scat
i leave behind, the drowned dream drains the lake .

my fucking flesh reamed sucking wires dreamed .
my fever's rising, chills turn the brain's hills rain
of flat blood, gave a shake of scat now steamed
then charred, lakes slake, sparks suffocate again .


Triode film, Baad images, Text rattling


Triode is formed with new software from experimental motion files. A 
triode is a fundamental vacuum tube with cathode, anode, and control 
grid. A triode amplifies, illuminates, rectifies in part, controls, is 
controlled, senses.

The baad* series is phomemic-buddha or consecutive/consexutive shaping of 
buddha-torso in response to a memory of human form or flower-ornament 
sutra (avatamsaka sutra). Both absorb desire. Both tend towards the 
ineffable. Both disguise sheave-skin, both are replete-emptiness.

In Triode the maverick sensors are sutured to the right shoulder, he/she 
has been wounded and dances the interior of the wound. I say interior, 
because the dance is one of conceivable rigging and thwarted continuous 
adjustment of inverse kinematics. And isn't all desire thwarted, when, 
within the aegis of the absolute, it is controlled from above? Or perhaps 
it is this very control that permits desire in the first place, caresses 
the place/space of fulfillment? Hear me out. 

For desire thrusts or procures against the absolute, which it hopes to 
transgress, and this hope is an amplifier. But there is nothing to 
transgress, everything is permitted; there is no aegis, no control, no 
absolute, but what one brings to us, down upon us. Instead there is a 
flowering which would not otherwise occur, as if flowering were dependent 
upon deflowering, which is equally established as the murmur of an origin. 
Here me out, for there is no origin, and one after another, the layers, 
sheave-skins, are peeled back, and one after another, nothing presents 
itself, nothing is present.

Triode is triple ode, or triple ode trod, and is a trio of cloth against 
skin, all sheave, and I beg you, pay close attention to the moment where 
culture drags the unwilling, centers them, or rather the unwilling, 
impaled by culture, willingly take center stage. Dear Poetics list, I 
insist this is the poetics of the true world, all the skittering inter- 
action apparent before the languorous* residue which forms triode.mp4 and 
numerous baad jpgs on the way to Indra's net...

Extensions, Poetics of


The motion capture software has been modified; the 'extended' video multi- 
plies angles by a fairly large factor; the 'tangent' videos substitute 
tangents for sins which resulting jumps; the 'single' videos remap the 
body onto a reconfigured software model using a 'wounded' model; and 
'quarter' combines two duets; both David and Azure operated a single 
outfit for each of the figures which were then combined (two bvh files 
were used in the production). These behavior patternings are both closer 
to 'human' behavior and more distant (they use greater and/ or infinite 
'leaps' from position to position, reminiscent of catastrophe theory 
modeling). I envision the behavior bvh files will be used in Second Life 
performance; that they will form a library for choreography; and that they 
will be made available in the near future to anyone who wants to upload 
and experiment with them. 

One interesting result with extended and tangent - the figure disappears 
in the Poser universe, unless a camera is tethered to a particular body- 
part. I'm unsure what will happen in Second Life, but I imagine the Nikuko 
avatar/emanent will be rooted in the usual way, but will be completely out 
of sight for the most part. This might lead to a 'broken choreography' in 
which a dancer appears literally 'miles' outside the dance-space, although 
rooted in it. And the appearance elsewhere is a kind of chimera of course; 
within the dance-space it would exist only in an imaginary, anysign of the 
true world, dark matter.

formula, and text filters using the program Jim Reith designed, it's also 
possible to construct filters that act upon the recording/residue of human 
behavior. In all of these situations, one might consider a unary filter 
such that f(x) = x+0 or x*1, similar to the protective glass filter used 
on camera lenses (but not the UV filter). With a camera for example, a 
neutral density filter is x/n, where x is lumens; the filter for digital 
images is similar, and the text filter requires that, instead of x equal- 
ling, for example, a particular position of a word in a text, it equals a 
position rounded to x/n, such that letters or words might tend to group or 
repeat roughly n times. With behavior - the x/n applied to the output of 
motion capture - the filter modifies, for example subtended node angles, 
which are diminished in size.

Now with analog camera filters (silver photography), the maximum x/n is 
x/1; with digital image filtering, the image can go to white (paralleling 
an increase, say, in shutter speed in silver) as n itself goes fractional, 
i.e. one has m*x where m > 1. In text, the result is skipping words (or, 
more accurately, sequences); in behavior, the subtended angle, and there- 
fore behavioral positioning, increases and the figure appears to move more 
'wildly.' The increase of the angle is cyclical of course, on the order of 
360 degrees; large m tend towards the synergetic appearance of _new,_ not 
diminished or exaggerated, behaviors as a result. 

With motion capture, digital imagery, and text, there is already filtering 
in place; the first two are protocol-discrete, and text, on the order of 
standardized graphemes, is discrete as well, most likely positioned within 
unicode. Complex neural behavior (which is _not_ on/off binary) combines 
discrete and analog filtering; the buzz of the world never appears, 
although death sinks within it. So one might consider a number of fuzzy 
layers - what passes for the buzz of the real; organic receptors, recep- 
tions, and processings; reproductive technologies both analog and digital; 
the assumption of coherent mappings between reproduction and the buzz; 
filtering of coherent mappings which re/produces hidden detailing of the 
buzz and/or uses the mappings as originary/catalyst for other produc- 
tions (not to mention mappings which have no relation to the buzz as far 
as the producer is concerned); and so forth - all of these characteriza- 
tions messy, inhering, worlding within the true world. 

(Abraham Moles, in Information Theory and Esthetic Perception, 1958/66, 
already relates filtering and information; speaking of sonic experimenta- 
tion, he states "In short, infinite clipping selectively destroys esthetic 
information, and, from a practical point of view, leaves only semantic 
information. Thus it 'filters' the two kinds of information." And "The two 
methods, clipping and inversion, are essentially means of observing seman- 
tic and eethetic information. They may be considered as _information fil- 
ters._ Neither one produces a perfectly dichotomous, absolute filtering; 
rather, each effects only a statistical filtering." The concept is rarely 
used in the book, which predates attempts at a _phenomenology of filter- 
ing,_ a phenomenology which (perhaps beginning with Pribram on retinal 
knowledge) leads to considerations of organism and Umwelt in general.)

Inhering characteristics of matter, let us say substance.


Let us say substance without differentiation, by which we mean, cohering 
matter, the phenomenology of the _same_ without transitivity (as in for 
example Irigaray). One is always lost in the same. At the limit, one might
consider the same a manifold without geodesics, striations, closed upon 
itself, windowless, sightless, catatonic. But this is only a limit, never 
found, incapable of seeing or being-seen; it is the limit of death, the 
maw that absorbs us all. Now to open it up a bit:

"RECAPITULATION. -- The common or essential properties of bodies are, Im- 
penetrability, Extension, Figure, Divisibility, Inertia, and Attraction.
Attraction is of several kinds, viz. attraction of Cohesion, attraction 
of Gravitation, Capillary attraction, Chemical attraction, Magnetic 
attraction, and Electrical attraction.

The peculiar properties of bodies are, Density, Rarity, Hardness, Elastic- 
ity, Brittleness, Malleability, Ductility, and Tenacity." 

(J L Comstock, A System of Natural Philosophy, 1854 and earlier.)

Electrical attraction is of one or two kinds, positive or negative, aus- 
tral or boreal. It is an inhering fluid which gathers, puckers, expends.

Shape comes: "FIGURE OR FORM _is the result of extension, for we can not 
conceive that a body has length and breadth, without its also having some 
kind of figure, however irregular._" Fractals come: "Some solids are so 
irregular, that they cannot be compared with any mathematical figure. This 
is the case with the fragments of a broken rock, chips of wood, fractured 
glass, &c.; these are called _amorphous._" Inversion comes: "A single 
grain of musk will scent a room for years, and still lose no appreciable 
part of its weight. Here, the particles of musk must be floating in the 
air of every part of the room; otherwise they could not be every where 
perceived."

What parts of the whole subtend figure, location, differentiation from the 
other? 

Attraction might be said to construct the other, the other's construction 
of the self, both and neither, imaginary, chimera. Gravitational attrac- 
tion is like to like; magnetic and electrical like to anti-like, but of 
the otherwise same; capillary, specific like to specific other, of which 
both adhere to their essential characters; chemical, unary or mutual 
transformation of specific like to specific other; and cohesion, like to 
like or like to specific other. 

The peculiar properties inhere. "RARITY. -- This is the quality opposite 
to density, and means that the substance to which it is applied is porous, 
and light. Thus air, water, and ether, are rare substances, while gold, 
lead, and platina, are dense bodies." Today this is in fact density, and a 
peculiar property in general might be considered that which is related to 
the atomic or molecular constitution of matter, or rather the particle 
constitution of matter, hence for example the neutron star, or rather the 
constituating configuration of matter, hence for example the black hole, 
or rather nearly decomposable phenomena, hence possibly dark matter or 
strings, or whatever preserves at least the very weakest of phenomenologi- 
cal structures in the true world and its descriptive messay/anysign.

From William Peck's Introductory Course of Natural Philosophy for the Use 
of Schools and Academies, edited from Ganot's Popular Physics, 1873: 

"Physics is that branch of Natural Philosophy which treats of the general 
properties of bodies, and of the causes that modify these properties.

The principle causes that modify the properties of bodies are: _Gravita- 
tion, Heat, Light, Magnetism,_ and _Electricity._ These causes are called 
_Physical Agents._"

There are solid and fluid bodies. Bodies have mass and density. The gener- 
al properties of bodies include Magnitude, Form, Impenetrability, Inertia, 
Porosity, Divisibility, Compressibility, Dilatability, and Elasticity. Be- 
yond Gravity, there are molecular forces which include Cohesion, Adhesion,
Capillary Forces, Absorption, Imbibition ("the absorption of a liquid by a 
solid body"), Tenacity, Hardness, Ductility, and Malleability.

The book, "Peck's Ganot," is based on Ganot's elementary version of his 
Traite Elementaire de Physique; I have the 3rd 1854 edition. Here, physi- 
cal agents are as follows: "l'attraction universelle, le calorique, la 
lumiere, le magnetisme et l'electricite." Under general properties of 
bodies: "l'impenetrabilite, l'etendue, la divisibilite, la porosite, la 
compressibilite, l'elasticite, la mobilite, et l'inertie." Particular 
properties are those observed in certain bodies or certain states of bod- 
ies, such as solidity, fluidity, tenacity, ductility, malleability, hard- 
ness, transparency, and coloration; there is density, weight, various 
forms of elasticity, etc. 

Heat, steam, hydraulics, magnetism, electricity, fluids, gas: the world is 
in flux, numerous solids are porous, some transparent to magnetism, x-rays 
and other out of directly perceivable bandwidth radiations and receptors - 
all challenge the muteness of amphiboles, some absorb others, some gener- 
ate others, some construct others as problematic, some are coherent, some 
inhere, some leak into Freud's hydraulic model, some are id-messy or 
libido-messy.

As I have pointed out, electrical fluid inhabits the spherical; the point, 
punctum, drains it. Harboring matter is puckered, withdrawn. The fluid 
seeps off in due time. It can be gathered in leyden jars, spewed from 
voltaic piles (dynamic or galvanic electricity), generated from machines 
(Wimhurst, von Guericke, etc.) with glass disks or cylinders or small 
furnaces and stem or cat fur, pith, resin, tin foil (see the electrophor- 
ous). It is social, the subject of "electrical recreations" led by men for 
young women holding hands, sparking one another, hair stood on end, short- 
circuiting jars and condensers. It's the men who electrocute dogs and 
birds, test the apparatus against the limits of life and death. It's the 
pith-man and pith-woman who jump up and down in funny embrace in a small 
electrostatic entertainment. It's the woman who demonstrates the magnetic 
swan to a small boy. 

There's ectoplasm, outside the ken of these books, these models, as are 
all sorts of spirits. Still, Peck/Ganot states right at the beginning: 
"The Universe may be regarded as made up of _mind_ and _matter._ MIND is 
that which thinks and wills; MATTER is that of which we become cognizant 
through the medium of the senses. Science admits of two corresponding 
divisions, _Science of Mind,_ or METAPHYSICS, and _Science of Matter,_ or 
NATURAL PHILOSOPHY."

Three simple points from all of this: Much coheres, inheres, to matter; 
some of what coheres or inheres is in problematic relation with an other 
(general or specific); and much of these relatively early dialogs empha- 
size a simplicity of fluidic substance and magnetic/electromagnetic 
experimentation. While the science and technical characterization of the 
world is clearly outmoded, the _phenomenology_ emphasizing a blurring of 
static and dynamic, force and presence, circuit and stasis, state and 
operator, and self and other, is rather sophisticated and uncannily 
resonates with the messy and problematic distinctions among analogic and 
digital/discrete domains, emanent and organic life, and real and virtual 
as well as sign and anysign, all within the true world. We can't stop now; 
we're just beginning to understand that the question isn't how many angels 
are dancing on the head of a pin - the question is, how many angels are in 
it.

After the Deluge


After the deluge of writing, resonant texts and languagings, and after the 
flood of words utterable and common, I searched for a word with suitable 
prevarication, hedging my bets until the day after. Then to my wisdom, 
prevarication itself appeared, murmured and approached, why, it said, I am 
only once among you, and then repeated in a gathering of abstract theory. 
Were there ten directions or beings from the ten directions, present or 
waiting for your arrival? Who were you, and why have we come upon you?

Grim Barrier at Second Life


Avatar attempting break-in at Second Life barrier, without permission s/he 
cannot enter through the barrier, and there is no permission for someone 
who is not a member and may not want to become one or may not believe the 
same things the members believe, so there is only one way to see what is 
going on, and that is to break in, which is such a hopeless thing, the 
poor avatar tries and tries at the gates of plenty and nothing seems to 
work and it is very sad, this useless struggle in the face of overwhelming 
odds as it seems that the entire world is against hir, even the weather 
refuses to provide a pleasant day which would make the struggle a delight- 
ful exercise, but now the brutal wind and cold unseasonable storm certain- 
ly intervenes, we can only feel terrible sorry and pity for the trials and 
vicissitudes of the unhappy avatar who pathetically tries forever in an 
unthinking and unfeeling world passing her by with lives of fulfillment 
and excitement s/he will never know,



Foofwa d'Imobilite smeared across space-time.

A slow laser scanned to +/- 1-2 millimeters over seven static scenarios
and 9 minutes.

The outer shell represents the behavioral space set to something like
9 millimeters.

Bodies in space surrounded by symbolic fields in the true world. We have
worked hard to construct the imaginary of being-human.

The difference between an image and a diagram is syntax.

In these smears, the underlying syntax is both spewed and abject. 
The skin of being human is replaced by an emanent shell. The image of 
the true world is just beyond the space of the proscenium.

Later, I will awake and write about the phenomenology of all of these,
videos, photographs, constructs, miniaturization of pre-alpine spaces,
dances of exaltation and mourning.


Too Many


Early mocap results with Foofwa d'Imobilite and Kira Sedlock. Why should 
you care? Doubles doubled, fabricated responses one to another as if 'the 
mutual orientation of cognitive domains' ensured, if not constructed, 
meaning. But then, the shell of the true world **

and why this constant production of the doubly-inundated body? Each ham- 
mers the other, shimmers the Other. But I'm worn out at this point and 
images are heaps on images and somewhere I'm sure something's elusive, or 
not?

But surely these are brilliant? Shimmer?

Emanent new-work in the true world


Abjection smears sound/space/time/inscription across vibration, vlf radio, 
scan, motion capture - work either at the limit, or smeared from the 
center. The center dissolves with sheave-skin but recuperates with shell 
thickening in 3d post-processing software. So far I'm fascinated by the 
images/sounds; although the differences with the avatar/mocap videos may 
appear minute, they represent fairly large- scale behavior differences in 
the studio.

3 z-axis non-scaled mods from Foofwa/Kira mocap
trilled/waltz are from the same bvh; one presents sheave-skin interior


This is as close as I can get to... ...gutsy organs, sloughed wade.
It's not very close; the sheave-skin breaks into air. I'd note that even
its mathematical substructure defines manifolds emptied of anything but
nurbs, splines, whatever - tension across the sheave.

Or rather the sheave/manifold - tension defined on the two-dimensional
curved surface. One might draw vectors for example. One pulls, pushes -
directly or through bvh and other manipulations. Mobility/intention in 
Second Life for example.

These vectors breathe in the surrounding space. With poles and polars, 
space is on the move. So you're saying? That abstractions, mapping, might, 
on a metaphorical level, pucker just about everywhere, a slid ontology.

It's sight, then? It's sight, or rather what's seen is what's sheave. 
Although of course one might make sheave or sheaves invisible; it's an 
option.

And there might be invisibilites built-in - everywhere, in SL, in Poser, 
across the true world? Yes, what we call ghosts are only these slid 
ontologies.

there is one encounter, and for that as for many other,s, for example that
of a stranger in the city, I hear no end of it, nothing coming forth, no
glued to transmission reception, I will be your transitive, I will pass on
among ye, I will pass before and behind thee, I will pass within thee, I
will pass without thee, and that which I convey I have already forgotten,
I am yaw to your mind, larboard to your starboard.

Who will be that one awaiting completion, who will signify the order of
completing, awaiting the completing, passing swiftly by?


Of the most beautiful captured images of dance


Last night I thought: Karl Kraus and Nietzsche, stillborn, damaged; no 
matter how clear the crystal, how strong an insistent dna produces those 
semblances of originary moments, everything disappears in the end. Or in 
the end is wounded, a wound. Nothing from the past needs to / can / heal; 
the past is superseded, bypassed; culture and species take circuitous 
routes. Death churns bodies as homes and habitus dissolve. These dances, 
however striated, remain unique as orbitals; our lab room will is perhaps 
close to abandonment, outside the snow is falling, perhaps for the very 
last time.


The lasedance series is cloud clusters; it takes, as Gary Manes would have 
it, considerable AI to decide on object choices. So these are raw data 
files which are by far the most beautiful, convey the most information. 
When you look at the gifs, click on the + sign to see them at the original 
size; otherwise, you'll get odd moire patterns which can be nuisance.

The exaggerated perspective exalts the performative aspects of the poses 
which capture in fact a compressed space-time dynamic. In booboo (named 
after Rat Pfink a Boo Boo) it's inverse; the motion is de/jected, reduced 
to that of an alien crab or daddy-long-legs (neither insect nor spider).

Five yeses to these: yes yes yes yes yes.



(Final) Frontier


I like to believe I'm working on a frontier and all I can tell you is 
what's on the normative side of things; the rest is yet to be seen, 
unabsorbed. Once brought in from the Pale, it's of lesser interest, but 
beyond the Pale there's nothing but the agony of shadows. Defuge takes 
over and the frontier, always an imaginary, shudders and reconvenes.

The videos/choreographies exist between human and human - someone was 
there making the original files with motion capture, and someone is at the 
other end, watching and using them once again. The virtual is a shadow of 
the real, the real is a shadow of the virtual, and within the true world 
superimpositions, gestures, and the fading of ontologies characterize what 
remains of the fixity of inscriptive practices of the classical and modern 
ages.

Distinctions are blurred through embedding and filtering. Avatars and 
humans - together, emanents - are embedded in online virtual worlds, in 
spaces which are simultaneously physical/inert/analog and virtual/mobile/ 
digital. Every seeing, every being, is a filtering; existence and copula 
are interwoven. A current collection of texts is called Messays; in a 
Messay, there's no leading sentence, no orderly sequence of ideas, no 
summings-up, no conclusions. The essay is to classical narratology as the 
messay is to future true world genres which seep into one another, head- 
less and tailless - meandering on the one hand, problematic obeisance to 
protocols on the other.

What we started with is the body which is inscribed with scars, scratches, 
tears, wounds, blemishes, abrasions, cuts, and all other debris carrying 
analogic history into the symbolic. What we continued with are tattoos, 
incisions, fashion, gesture, languagings, and what continually emerges is 
the body harboring technology as self retreats or withdraws, puckers, from 
the wild symphonics of externally-applied filters digging ever deeper.

The walk or arm-swing becomes gesture becomes anysign becomes trade-off, 
translation, transformation, exchange, interoperability, reified territor- 
ialization. One sits at a console and breathes through sheave-skin, 
another begins vortex stage-center with flesh-electric, a third wanders 
memory of others airless, unbreathing, peripheral wanderings mediated at 
mind's back. From the airless, flesh-breathers are attracted, gather, 
project and introject, their selves flowing, flooding, abjecting, full of 
scent and coagulation.

We take our tiny community of people up and down mountains, in and out of 
clubs and iced fields, across the chiasm of cut bodies and body cuts, 
mines and other extractive industries across the flesh of land and bodies. 
What we bring back is always new, even if only in the slightest detail, a 
brush of the hand or turn of the head that was never seen before. And we 
keep to our goal of understanding filtering and embedding better than 
before, and understanding bodies in the always future anterior world, the 
true world of emanents and anysign where we're living, breathing, writing 
and wryting, this and any future day.

Almost every avatar you see represented is a composite of two people; if 
you see two avatars engaged with one another, the engagement is contiguous 
at best, and each avatar is itself a composite. The composites are male 
and female; they reflect and murmur other in relation. Two are four, four 
are eight, eight are sixteen. Or more, depending on the configuration of 
motion-capture, the independence of minds and intentions. 

Laplanche and Pontalis, The Language of Psychoanalysis, the Imaginary:

"In the sense given to this term by Jacques Lacan (and generally used 
substantively); one of the three essential orders of the psycho-analytic 
field" [...]

[...] "Lacan brought forward the idea that the ego of the human infant - 
as a result, in particular, of its biological prematurity - is constituted 
on the basis of the image of the counterpart (specular ego).

Bearing in mind this primordial experience: we may categorize the 
following as falling  into the Imaginary:

a. from the intrasubjective point of view, the basically narcissistic 
relation of the subject to his ego;

b. from the intersubjective point of view, a so-called _dual_ relationship 
based on - and captured by - the image of a counterpart (erotic attrac- 
tion, aggressive tension). For Lacan, a counterpart (i.e. another who is 
me) can only exist by virtue of the fact that the ego is originally 
another." [...]

Thus simultaneously a space of mirroring and of singular constitution, a 
space of a real and an evanescence. In Second Life, objects are 
constituted in relation to a well-ordered data-base, without which the 
enumeration of potential behaviors, constructions, and wanderings would 
be impossible. 

"another who is me" - another always is me, neither constitutive nor part- 
and-parcel. One leaps on the page to "Incorporation": "Process whereby the 
subject, more or less on the level of phantasy, has an object penetrate 
his body and keeps it 'inside' his body." Etc. etc., more or less. One 
might argue that it is always incorporation, that the world is world by 
virtue of _devouring._ I would ask, who pulls the strings, moves the 
sensors, whereby one has been two, two murmur one, in these image of 
behaviors that are simultaneously inconceivable, and at the root of every 
narrative?

It doesn't stop there; the avatars are the result of filtered behavior, 
filtered in such a way that f(n) does not equal 1, i.e. is not trans- 
parent, but in fact transforms behavior into caricature that gnaws at the 
body, representative and within a primordial gnawing, if you like. (This 
filtering occurs in the transmission/reception stage of raw sensor data 
turning towards coherent representation. Filtering is mobile, perhaps 
system noise, more likely hacking or rupture, the dim imaging of presence 
unaccounted-for. Any reception is filtered - I'm arguing for yet another 
stage in the communications model, existing in those liminal interfaces 
among block-diagram entities and arrows.)

Table 5, Eco's theory of codes in A Theory of Semiotics - the Watergate 
(hydraulic) Model interpreted in relation to expression and content 
planes. But framed on the left: "Continuum / Light, electric phenomena / 
Non-semiotic matter" and on the right: "Continuum / the unshaped continuum 
of the position of the water along with everything one can think about it 
/ Non-semiotic matter." One discretely cuts surgically within the analogic 
which remains impervious, bounding; a discrete cut cuts discretely, con- 
structs difference across fissure, that is operates within and constructs 
inscription. Isn't the world such an inscription? Let us think of non- 
semiotic matter as _dark matter_ to be brought within the fold (pli).

Selves are located, others and an others are located, between these mat- 
ters, which are all that matter, out of which the drawing-forth is tempor- 
ary at best. Nagarjuna has no position and this positionlessness is as 
close as one can get. 

The doubled figures within the figures of the avatars you see projected on 
the screen, live or in careful reproduction, are uncanny; they appear in 
documentary footage to be completely independent, but by virtue of the 
sensors are connected, as in Bell's theorem, in such a manner as a frac- 
tured _monother_ or entity is produced. Conflicting forces are combined 
without effect or affect traveling among them: there is no resolution, 
only tearings as the image-monother accommodates them all. Think of the 
movements as _catatonic sex-dances_ or rites of passage held in position 
precisely by those noisy channels which, parasitic, spew culture in other- 
wise dull transmissions. A catatonic sex-dance is a molding or ingestion, 
incorporations, of others in order to form selves (an 'adult' is an entity 
whose flesh is carved into the semblance of a human being). A dance is 
called 'sex-dance' if it is dual; it is also 'corporation-dance,' 'money- 
dance,' 'incorporation-dance,' 'culture-dance,' 'death-dance.' Sheave- 
skins generate nothing internally but imaginaries; externally, they 
generate internals. Think of the monother as worlding, the mapping of 
external universes onto, within, small finite spaces which appear coher- 
ent, the mapping cohering. The dance, like that of bees, is of course any 
communication, established or not, channeled or not; one might think of 
beings inhabiting monothers in such a way that their touch is full, 
replete, of one another. What you see on the screen may appear both tired 
and strange, but it is also a model of the true world within which 
monothers characterize life and lives, living, inhabitations, habitus. 
(Think of the 'it' in 'one going it alone.') 

You have to look for the specific discrete levels, nodes, configurations, 
on the expression plane - all of which are moving at high-speed - but you 
_must_ look, drawing forth a narrative, which, like all others, is yours 
and yours alone and ties, however uncomfortably, the appearance of beings 
into Being. You have to see monothers shimmering among modes of existence, 
ontologies, for example, movements among rocks and cliffs and movements 
among intended rocks and cliffs, deferring among intentional/configured 
ontologies, and those which are mute, inert, idiotic. Or divide the cata- 
tonic sex-dance into substance-catatonia (misnomer and oxymoron to boot) 
and inscription-sex-dance (the same, the other boot, terms booting mono- 
thers into the arena). 

Now you're getting closer to the relationship among inscription, code, 
substance, communication, &tc, and further might bring you permanently, 
like a matchmaker.com, into collusion from collocation, where contiguity 
and contingency meld and something permanently unnameable emerges, where 
Nagarjuna's grasping, samsara, appears:

" When there is a grasping, the grasper
  Comes into existence.
  If he did not grasp,
  Then being freed, he would not come into existence. "

(The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way, Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakar- 
ika, translation and commentary Jay L. Garfield.)

Let them go at that.



true world newsreel


The newsreel of part-objects, snippets of radio communication as heard, 
stuttered stories which remain incomplete, deferred, a call for help from 
a vessel, things burning, missing, people with guns, raptures, misrecogni- 
tions, what makes the night go faster in Brooklyn New York and everywhere. 
This is the truth of cinema, raw-fed documentary. If there were a narrato- 
logical ground, this would be it; if there were recuperation, this would 
be the initial stages of constitution. Everything defers to raw data, 
which, by a circuitous route, announces itself, establishes sequencing by 
repetition. Every inscription is unique, of a sort or type, typed. The 
lexicon of events is narrow. Listening reveals nothing but whispers that 
there is nothing to be revealed, or what is present is of revelation. What 
remains to be said or inscribed is the coagulation of culture. Every 
culture has a theory sifting coagulation; such a theory is culture. There 
is no gainsaying this, no way to make headway, no events; there is voice.

He died in her sleep.

(or: She died in his sleep.)

'For vices all have different ends,
But virtue still to virtue tends.'
(Swift)
The long and narrow road, catastrophe theory's fragility of good things, 
beset on every side by the efflorescence, fecundity, of vice; if Heaven is 
pure substance, Vice is impure inscription; if Heaven is continuous, Vice 
is discrete; if Heaven is discrete, Vice is the heart of indiscretion 
itself.

He died in their sleep. In their longing for rest, he was one of the 
forgotten, his body withering away to practically nothing, his data-base 
entries under erasure, digitally smudged, evaporated. Perhaps he said 
something, anything, at one point, but pronouns long since disappeared.

'_The chora,_ which is neither "sensible" nor "intelligible," belongs to a 
"third genus" (_triton genos,_ 48e, 52a). One cannot even say of it that 
it is _neither_ this _nor_ that or that it is _both_ this _and_ that." 
(Derrida)
Sheffer added another before his death, not _both_ this _and_ that. 
I added these comments, as well, before my death, which I await, again, in 
someone else's sleep, that unknown of dreaming I shall never greet.

I'm going nowhere, but I'm going straight.
There's a bridge ahead, what if I go right?
What if I go left, there's a bridge ahead.
The bridge vectors the world, what if it's 3-d?
What if something's underneath, dark woods and trolls?
Or picture of dark woods or wandering, I'm too wandering.
Everything's washed away, my tongue's cut out.
I can't take this picture and I took this picture.
I can't take it anywhere, I'm going nowhere.

There's nothing in the stream between one fork and another.
But the earth, the earth.

transformed by an absence of disappearance, only transformations of view- 
point. everything is there, just as one might have planned, frozen moments 
at the end of the universe.

events are collapsed, as if they're time sliced, 4 into 3 into 2-d, then 
everything unravels at the other end, it's up to you, bring in the soft- 
ware, I'll supply the objects. then you might explore something stolid, 
interactive by its very nature, you come in wherever you want, leave 
whenever. now I must retire, Jezebel's on television, moving about in a 
very limited area, and I'm breathless.}

This Sex which is not None


"When I move my eyes, I take account of their movement, without being 
expressly conscious of the fact, and am thereby aware that the upheaval 
caused in my field of vision is only apparent. Similarly sexuality, 
without being the object of any intended act of consciousness, can 
underlie and guide specified forms of my experience,. Taken in this way, 
as an ambiguous atmosphere, sexuality is co-extensive with life. In other 
words, ambiguity is of the essence of human existence, and everything we 
live or think has always several meanings. A way of life - an attitude of 
escapism and need of solitude - is perhaps a generalized expression of a 
certain state of sexuality,. In thus becoming transformed into existence, 
sexuality has taken upon itself so general a significance, the sexual 
theme has contrived to be for the subject the occasion for so many 
accurate and true observations in themselves, of so many rationally based 
decisions, and it has become so loaded with the passage of time that it is 
an impossible undertaking to seek, within the framework of sexuality, the 
explanation of the framework of existence, The fact remains that this 
existence is the act of taking up and making explicit a sexual situation, 
and that in this way it has always a double sense. There is interfusion 
between sexuality and existence, which means that existence permeates 
sexuality and _vice versa,_ so that it is impossible to determine, in a 
given decision or action, the proportion of sexual to other motivations, 
impossible to label a decision or act 'sexual' or 'non-sexual.' Thus there 
is in human existence a principle of indeterminacy, and this indeterminacy 
is not only for us, it does not stem from some imperfection of our 
knowledge, and we must not imagine that any God could sound our hearts and 
minds and determine what we owe to nature and what to freedom. Existence 
is indeterminate in itself, by reason of its fundamental structure [...]" 
(Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception)

It's murky, this being always hinting at structure or organ, somewhere 
down beneath the surface (invisible from the surface, from the exterior), 
well something's there causing the commotion, a messy engine or drive, 
pulsion, a vibration which comes and leaves in fits. Hard to reconcile 
with the rest of the chattered world, that boy's got something, that 
girl's got something, as if on a day in spring, a ripening, and what does 
that have to do with one's place in the cosmos? One begins to discern 
structure, a presence or devouring presence or presence to be devoured, 
but dimly, a symbol, cupped hands lifting up, you can hold water that way. 
The skin holds water, filters it. See, here's the Thing, Being is tawdry, 
sad, something to kick around, we can't get to the Universal; Being or 
beings make no difference at all, nothing, they're like a pair of socks, 
something to run around in. Being or emptiness, beings or Emptiness, we're 
talking about ourselves, a local farm, what's temporarily present in the 
biome. It's a "region," just as sex-being, being-sex, existence is a 
region, a region which is perhaps regional, perhaps not. Carrying organs 
and communities within us, and they make all the decisions, separations, 
our cries and murmurs, analytics, are regional paste, local determinations 
within the inconceivable; our conceptualizations are skitterings. It's a 
truism - I talk and write from inside my body. Conceptually, say whatever 
you want, this language machine, this computer, goes back to the Acheulian 
hand-ax and earlier; tools were always with us, always thrusting into 
earth or stem or flesh.

This is why existence is a dead word and sex is not; sex starts inside 
something and moves inside something and maybe something else, and 
existence, beings and Being, does nothing. Or does nothing outside the 
copula; existents reside within the copula, they're chained-linked in our 
imaginary which tries to hang on, with the slimmest of threads, to some- 
thing that might be considered, not only external (for we sense those, the 
scent of the true world), but out there, structure paralleling our own. We 
"just" tend to forget the copula, a female or male hand tying a knot 
making speaking, these wrytings, possible. Sexuality brings whatever else 
there is into the local; my body reflects my body, there's an uncanny 
surrounding, insistent on present presence, alterity, imminence, as if 
"here" and "there" jump-started one another in the boot-strap model of 
existence, powered by sex.

Sexual organs are situated, their effect that of diffusion, existence 
diffuses "as far as we're concerned," as far as "we're intended"; it's 
that hint of structure, which is somewhat other, messily other, that sur- 
faces as abstracted desire-in-language - all these names, desire, libido, 
frisson, arousal, id, what have you, and nothing's there, certainly not 
existence which seems to be driven by energy, impulse, force, unintended 
churning. Why we hardly know what we are. Or rather one might take struc- 
ture, as if it could separate from desire, existence, meta-psychology, 
meta-physics - one might take structure and make experiment of it. There 
are always artifacts, however ephemeral. You get practice out of it, 
communication, you can take it to the bank.

You get tangled up when thinking about the organs; it's better to keep 
things beneath the covers, much as existence is kept out of sight, out of 
our site to be sure. We always mistake the copula for copulation, the 
attribute for the thing, the thing for possible worlds, possible worlds 
for occurrences, occurrences for Being remote again from the organs; the 
true world is the mattering/nattering to and among us, and we have to mess 
with the symbolic in all sorts of ways - for example inscription, and then 
one form of erasing or another. Not to mention the magic slate, what's 
uncanny, what's strange, what estranges us.

There's nothing to say about emptiness but Nagarjuna says nothing anyway.





Face/t/ed


He can't get away from the face but doesn't realize it's not hollow, it's 
disappearance, defuge. If he would only turn around! But he doesn't, he 
thinks he's caught. Kira Sedlock and Foofwa d'Imobilite bring you the 
shuddering of a man beside himself within himself, caught by solids. 

It's untrue that, being caught, there's nothing catching one; the hard 
inertia of substance pins one to the ground. But inscription offers the 
last possibilities of play, the last chance to move, walk away from an 
anonymous other, not even a thing. Sheave-skin ephemera hardly survive; 
sustained by energy input from somewhere else ontologically at variance 
with their world, they're wayward, contrary. They don't face anything 
else, they never can. I thought of this man once, years ago, in the form 
of an iron sphere somewhere in space. I thought something went on inside. 

The first lesson I learned was absence. The second was the dream.



(When things go on limbs from scans of things moving slow.
(When things stand for limbs in communities of narrative.
(When things copulate things petrified they stand still.

(- as scans are attached to bodies, body parts - in other words nodes. A 
scan is already a compression begging for wandering as a means towards 
diegesis. And so many figures within it!: Foofwa d'Imobilite, Azure 
Carter, David Bello, Kira Sedlock and myself - all find their way into 
wrapping, merging, hole-filling, shelling, smoothing, fine-tuning - all 
for a ragged presence run amuck, wayward, back again with the doubling of 
d'Imobilite, Sedlock, Carter and Bello. By the way, these productions use 
behavioral filtering - sin to tan for the most part - skittering scans and 
the memory of things off to infinity and back again, what happens between 
or among frames. (If you've watched any of the recent work, this culmin- 
ates the use of .obj files as cloth/ing narrative punctum. If you haven't, 
this and this might be the ones to watch. If you have you will see how 
these have moved from the other recent movies. Then you can see how 
narrative comes from objects close to dreams or deity generation, Tibetan 
stem, and nowhere to go but outward through the real.)) 


Birthing Homedance, Cross My Heart


Here is the plain description:
*Birthing: male with part-objects of female/birthing attached in anomalous 
Freudo-Lacanian space. The shudder, chiaroscuro. With sound. Continuous 
birthing with the weight of ruins of things.
*Homedance: male in silent homespace in two parts, first sine, second 
tangent. Movement of home is the heart of the male. The home is detached, 
Here is a moral: Home, habitus, is an illusion; everything is on the verge 
or lip of decathecting. And movement as well is an illusion occasioned by 
the hip rooted in camera-vision. 
*Crossmyheart: Female with the weight of shattered truth, an illusory 
enclosure which topologically transforms according to space and behavior.
Here is the theoretical move:
That of narrative moments which "breathe" without development, mise en 
scene or landscape of portents, portals, disturbed behavioral filters 
seduced by part-objects and the uncanny.

I'll try to keep this short - text for NSF workshop on Codework

i.

I want to generalize writing and coding as _inscription,_ and emphasize
that the world as we know it is already inscribed, encoded and decoded.
The lifeworld isn't analogic and/or mute; it's discrete and presencing.
It's discrete because we deal with symbols in order to communicate; we're
sending signs or tokens back and forth, very rarely the physical objects
of our desire.

One way of thinking about this is in terms of _filtering._ The usual model
of information, transmitter through receiver (with stuff of all sorts in
the middle channel) implies that there is a form of coherency and, if not
comprehension, at least "mutual orientation of cognitive domains," between
sender and receiver. I'd argue that this orientation occurs through
filtering which is always present, fuzzy, and possessing a political
economy of its own (think of Pribram's "retinal knowledge" for example,
the neural processing that occurs in the retina before signals are sent
from the eye to the brain).

Filtering isn't active or passive, inscribed or inscribing, and informa-
tion itself is non-existent, nothing, a form of particulate matter with an
ontology derived from organisms and apparatus.

Once we start (or end) here, "creative" writing splits; on one hand it
becomes _wryting_ - that's spelled with a "y" -a state of material
transformation, transmission, and reception; and on the other, it becomes
malleable, a spew interpreted as symbols. Here is the moment of creative
freedom which also splits - on one hand into or through unbounded, rule-
less 'creative' writing, drawn from an organism's interior - and on the
other, a fuzzy collocation of coding, languages, kludges, protocols, drawn
equally from interior impulse and external restraints (economic, etc.) or
goals that may be transformed in the process of inscription.

(I want to note that in the work I'm doing here at the Virtual Environ-
ments Laboratory, I've been exploring visual configurations or inscrip-
tions, configurations in which spaces, avatars, and objects interact in
uncanny ways, simultaneously malleable and protocol-driven:

Working within the visual and time-based register, static and dynamic
processes blur into one another. We can temporally code a tableau, moving
performers during slow-scan in much the same manner as characters appear-
ing at both ends of a panoramic photograph. We can also move them in terms
of depth, and we can create an interactive diorama in which the viewer
enters and meanders, reconstructing the original sequence of events. We
can also combine a tableau with encoded and restructured motion-capture
behaviors, using avatars or mannequins circulating among the diorama
elements, as "tourists" among ruins - in this manner there are several
interlocking layers of interpretation, the viewer in the midst of them.

With the aid of 3-dimensional laser scanning, we can present abject ele-
ments as if they were interior projections of the "tourists" themselves,
and it's not far from this that the potential for a 4-dimensional reading
or interpreting (seeing, witnessing) of 3-dimensional object _interiors_
occurs. The result is a 5-dimensional manifold as cultural object,
cultural abject. The possibilities for exploration are enormous here, a
kind of pure escapism of dialog, narrative, arousal, creation and
annihilation, in which ultimately nothing happens, no one gets hurt.

So this leads to another direction I'll just mention briefly - thinking of
creative writing as a kind of inscribing in any medium at all. We can then
talk about creative inscription, creative coding, whatever, emphasizing a
"new media" approach to all of this, rather than thinking of electronic
literature, e-literature, interactive writing, etc.)

To misquote the physicist David Finkelstein, one might consider program-
ming as fucking with/in a universe of abstracted ontologies, and creative
writing as masturbation-fantasy, moving just about anywhere, anywhen. Both,
however, have inscription and filtering in common and neither presents or is
pure 'presence' within the world. On the other hands, both meander among
rules, although with differing obeisance, and both have, at their core, a
freedom that is as absolute as anything gets.

How can this be useful pedagogically? In terms of creative writing, the
answer is, I believe, to think of texts as both intentional, cohering, and
as material objects which are always already filtered; this leads to
thinking about filtering and different forms of filtering as creative
writing practice. In terms of programming, not being a programmer (but
working with programmers), I'm not sure; I'd argue that, for an outsider,
filtering appears at the interstices or liminal spaces between program and
framework (inputs, outputs, interfaces, hardware (in the traditional
sense, and in the sense of information-laden substance), and so forth).
And I'd want to look at the phenomenological horizons of programming, not
only through this filtering, but also within programs and programming in
general: Where is the programmer in the midst of her subroutine? And where
is the freedom then/there?

I do want to note one final thing here - that I'm placing too much empha-
sis on specificity, the discrete. One of the directions I've been explor-
ing at the VEL is to consider the _abject,_ which remains indeterminate
and close th analogic substance - something "gooey," not "GUI," for
example. It's here that we humans can explore the world which refuses
discrete curtailment, which abjures communication.

ii.

Some parallels between poetry and code:

1. Both treat language as a material with "additional," even surplus,
structure in relation to presumably normative prose. In other words,
poetry works with tropes such as rhyme, rhythm, "resonance," metaphor,
metonymy, etc. - all the devices of rhetoric that appear linguistic
"material" - acoustic or page/screen/etc. - on a meta- or abject- level,
just as codework works with protocols, elements extraneous to the surface
meaning, but inextricably entangled with it.
2. Both are "writerly" texts in the sense that, in order to read them,
additional work (meta, interiority) is required that's not required of
standard prose.
3. One might say that standard prose possesses subtexts in the sense of
"underlying meanings" that encompass paragraphs, chapters, entire works -
while the subtexts of codework and poetry are also on the level of letters,
words, sentences, and so forth. I remember the Mirror of Composition saying
that "A poem is a sentence with flavour." (rasa). That applies.
4. On a practical level, the communities of practitioners intersect -
Vincent Cerf has poetry in the RFC, there are Perl poems, and there are
poets who work through concepts of programming, such as Catherine Daly.




jump to the point

Sheave skin / carapace like leather illustrating theoretical talk. I'm 
sick of the human form. It jumps from one reading to another; it recep- 
tion is too automated, too buried. It's far too familiar, too vulnerable 
to defuge, over-cathecting, decathecting, arousal, hormonal secretions, 
reflex archaeology of fear, flight, violence, love, imprinting, fetishiz- 
ation. It's brutal; it catalyzes behavioral repertoires - states jump 
catastrophically from one to another. It's as if there's no abjection or 
no abjection worth talking about (you can't talk about abjection). I'm 
sick of abjection, sick of steamy sleazy squeamed-space; its liminality 
depends on the body and what's taken for its (sickening) normative form. 
Bend it, twist it, otherwise transform it - the elements always assert 
themselves, our eyes betray us into false familiarity. So here goes again 
another variation just as almost every story is variation on bodies 
through time, bodies squawking, squealing, mewling, talking, yakking, 
yacking, yapping, humming, singing, whatever bodies do, I guess cry, 
weeping, laughing. There's only somewhat bodies do; there's only somewhat 
subjects see.

I'm sick of the discourse of bodies, fluids, war, violence, arousal, sex, 
secretion, membrane, excretion, effluvia, defuge, liquidity, the damp and 
scent, the odor and smell, wound, carapace, tissue, flesh, scar, pain; 
what more could possibly be said, recast, transformed, transfused, in- 
fused, written and rewritten, wrytten - in fact or fancy, inscription or 
symbol, mark or token, analog or digital, subject or object, fissure or 
sinter, sign or image, imaginary or imaginary? It goes on and on, struc- 
ture and substructure, text and subtext, mathesis and semiosis, substance 
and process, state and operator. It never breaks out; it can't break out, 
it's all their is, even inscription goes on within it, emptiness goes on 
within it, tantra goes on within and without it, analogic and metonymic, 
metaphoric and contrary: discrete and the wound of nothingness.

So again it's trying to talk, trying to assemble, to dissemble, trying to 
_seem,_ trying to walk-talk in airless space, in dimension-five space, in 
slice-of-death. It's trying to tell us something, we're too bored to care, 
too inundated to listen, too lost for comfort: we're the dis of dis/ease, 
dis/comfort, dis/semble, dis/crete. Bodies churn, worlds are minimal, true 
world is all there is, is there. 


Stretched faces, I'm sick of stretching, I can't face them, you see the 
faceless, you'll make something out of it, you'll make something with it, 
you'll make something of it. I'm done with it, it's done with me, it's the 
same old story that's the same old story, it's the other, there's none 
other, there's nothing accountable, it's unaccounted-for, unaccountable, 
uncountable, it's abject, I'm gone, I'm out of here, I'm lost in it, I'm 
lost in you, I'm lost in them, I'm outside looking in, I'm inside looking 
out.

Analogy


"The most important analogy of all is that of affiliation: the candidate 
should affiliate his body, speech, and mind with the Body, Speech, and 
Mind of the Buddha, called the three mysteries. According to Mkhas grub 
rje, it is this affiliation which establishes the superiority of the 
Diamond Vehicle (the Tantras) over non-tantric Buddhism. One affiliates 
his body by gesture (mudra), his speech by incantation (mantra) and his 
mind by deep concentration (samadhi). Mkhas grub rje's Fundamentals... 
states, 'In the Kriya and Carya (Tantras) one intensely contemplates the 
body as Great Seal (mahamudra), speech as Incantation (mantra), and mind 
as Reality (tattva). This is the 'Quick Path' because all avenues of the 
being are operating for a common goal: the body, speech, and mind are not 
working at cross purposes.

In such a case, we might say of body, speech, and mind, what Arya-Sura 
wrote in his Jataka-mala in description of King Sihi (but in his case 
meaning the three types, kama, artha, and dharma). [...]

'In him all forms having multitudes of virtues consistent with the three 
types appeared with common residence as though from merger of rivalries, 
and they had no loss of brilliance due to opposition and commotion.'

In Hinduism it is believed that these three types when in harmony yield 
the fourth one, liberation (maksa)."

(Alex Wayman, Yoga of the Guhyasamajatantra, The Arcane Lore of Forty 
Verses, A Buddhist Tantra Commentary, Motilal Banardsidass, 1990.)

(perhaps unlike software/programming) in my work, there are no errors, 
only creative commotion on the lip, edge, or brink; there are repertoire 
extensions to be sure; analogy dissolves; commotion is brilliance; what 
dissolves is nothing whatsoever; what's left is nothing whatsoever; in the 
airless realm; in the unintended or intentionless realm; in the true world 
and the breaking of intention and the intended; in annihilation already 
foregone or future anterior; in the blank of the afterthought of the alpha 
channel; in mind noh-mind no-mind; in mindless speechless air; in no-body.

(i am full of myself; full of air; i suffocate; therefore i am air.)

Vishuddi Magga vi:

And then, when any such bits of it as head hairs, body hairs, nails, 
teeth, spittle, snot, excrement or urine have dropped off the body, beings 
will not touch them; they are ashamed, humiliated, and disgusted. But as 
long as any one of these things remains in it, though it is just as 
repulsive, they take it as agreeable, desirable, permanent, pleasant, 
self, because they are wrapped in the murk of ignorance and dyed with 
affection and greed for self. (trans. Bhikkhu Nanamoli)

A proof of this is the fact that when any part of the body becomes 
detached, as, for instance, the hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, 
teeth, phlegm, snot, faeces, or urine, people are unwilling so much as to 
touch it, and are distressed at, and ashamed of, and loathe it. But in 
respect of what remains, though that is likewise repulsive, yet men are so 
wrapped in blindness and infatuated by a passionate fondness for their own 
selves, that they believe it to be something desirable, lovely, lasting, 
pleasant, and an Ego. (trans. Henry Clarke Warren)

l'hommage


Homage to Talan Memmott's summary presentation at the recent NSF Codework 
Workshop with a light-hearted romp of somewhat silly maneuvers - not his 
presentation a light-hearted romp, but the homage to the presentation 
which was as well summary of the workshop and brilliant performance. I had 
to do this, keep working, keep my hand in up to the elbows shouldering the 
pain in the neck bringing code to its knees. What silliness. Now I have to 
do something else. Now I must do something else. Now I need to do it. Now 
I want to do it.

I want to do something else. I am tired of the human body. Mine like yours 
is dying. I didn't ask for it to be here. I didn't ask for I, I didn't ask 
for anything. If my body were online it would be airless, you could make 
it float, you could look inside me, I could fly, you could tell me when 
and where to fly, you could make me speak, you could make me say anything 
you want, you could make me naked, you could make me sex anything you want 
or crawl anything you want, you could make me jump.

You could dress me in a nice suit of clothes, you could make me Valeska 
G., you could make me whore-stumble, clown-dance, traffic-cope, you could 
make me disappear, every time you come back, I am resurrect. You could 
make me you, you could give me life, spirit, texture, coordinate, home, 
supplement, hair, eye, breast, waist, foot, arm, head, lip. 

Could you threaten me, you could not threaten me, you could disappear, I 
could disappear, I could change, run, walk, fly, you could do nothing, I 
could do everything, you could make me dirty dirty, you could not make me 
dirty, you could not make anything dirty dirty, not me, I'm tired of this, 
I'm in nice darkspace, bad darkspace, anyspace, anysign, I'm not tired of 
anything, defuge is a sickness, you are defuge, nauseous, dismal, dank, 
sewage. 

O look at me move, look at you move, look at moves, look at nothing, look 
at sheave-skin, look at hole, look corrode, look decay, Oh look! All falls 
apart, nothing coordinates, has coordinates, axis, scale, affinage, twis- 
tage, unlinkage, mucilage, walkage, moveage, loginage. Oh look I am so me

Phenomenology of mannequin-avatar construction


From mannequin avatar discovered in the back of the immersive 3d desk room 
through scanning programs, as in second life, so in first, as in the bar- 
rier or injunction against the milk of the mother in this dry and airless 
realm, once entering the computer for resonant transform back through fil- 
tering into perception and thereby repressed spread across yet more and 
other injunctions of the other - from skin through plaster-plasticine, 
from ligament through metal pinning, skein thrusts forth across impotent 
transformations yet a boy can dream can't he. 

These are stillborn, static formations of .obj files, in other words ob- 
jects, for insertion into true world video/performance. In other words, an 
epistemo-ontological rebus, perhaps condensation/displacement of previous 
work, displaced into/outto mannequin towards maquette, maquette towards 
model towards inscription lifted from the magic writing slate. 

Enter the sleazy, tawdry - enter defuge as annihilated punctum; doesn't 
the same thing happen to every boy and girl in second life? All those 
exaggerated breasts, penises, lips, toppling airless bodies with physics 
configured in a distant memory of a newborn and innocent physical world, 
taking us taking it for granted. What's revealed beneath the surface is 
the phal-lick; what's revealed beneath the phal-lick is the surface 
emptied of content, inscribed, exhausted. There's nothing there there. 
Either the surface is closed/clothed or it's emptied, sheave-skin, already
torn, fallen apart, sleazy (as if the night revealed real members of 
itself, real w/wholes).

The mannequin cracks. Topologically, an organism is a coherent (linked) 
multiply-pierced torus defined everywhere; topologically, a mannequin is 
an un-linkable fissured structure which may or may not be hollow - i.e. a 
set of manifold sections and spheres. Neither has well-defined nodes; the 
body has no well-defined parent-child relationships; the manifold has 
well-defined parts and linking mechanisms. Tissues, organs, organelles, 
etc. of the body are often porous, self-defining, resilient, multiply- 
connected through nerves, ligaments, musculature, blood and other vessels, 
transport mechanisms of all sorts, repair and defense mechanisms, etc. 
These mechanisms are not mechanical; they depend on a local electro-chemi- 
cal environment; they are processes requiring constant maintenance. The 
mannequin is passive, a well-defined collection of well-defined states. 

Oh what's the difference, I'm here, they're there, or vice versa, all 
these false identification existing only as long as the brain functions, 
mind 'works,' however defined, and this isn't well-.

Video materials, once one has a shield, everything falls into place. But 
how can one use a shield against the immense vitality of the Universe! 
Space and time beyond all comprehension! Unfathomable measurement! We're 
just here for a second of eternity! No wait, a nanosecond of eternity! 
Wait, we're just a page between life and death! A spot on the sunglasses 
of God! A furrow of the imaginary! No wait!

The thing about Valeska Gert, obdurate substance, there's flicking of the 
symbolic, nothing concrete, she's too smart, too fluid, for that. She's 
either an impersonator (mind you, of the highest order) or a philosopher! 
That's my role of thinking. Deities flicker on the lip-nub of death. 

The worldling praxis of aim having been formed in the heart, he the Tatha- 
gata, creating a conventional body, practices desires exactly as he cares. 
(from 40 verses in Yoga of the Guhyasamajatantra, translated Waxman)

If philosophy is to remain true to the law of its own form, as the repre- 
sentation of truth and not as a guide to the acquisition of knowledge, 
then the exercise of this form - rather than its anticipation in the 
system - must be accorded due importance. (Walter Benjamin, The origin of 
German Tragic Drama)


Fields 


Sensors arranged in a random pattern on the floor. A heavy magnet is 
passed over them; there is no other movement. In these (6 condensed) 
experiments the result is the usual vibrating. The movements could be 
decoded to some extent, indicating the relative positions of the magnet 
and sensors. Eventually the sensors will be placed in the standard body 
pattern, held in position with a card or foam surface, and the magnet 
again moved over the configuration. The result this time should be a 
mapping of the field as it intersects the body pattern, a mapping both 
useful as a tool for field visualization, and for modeling a 'force' 
moving upon a human being, for example wind or water, but with a source 
re/coding/filtering the body, held of course supine

under the greatest anguish or ecstatic exaltation

Anything might be represented in this manner. The world's parameters 
devolve upon or within the body; the body bends for data, bends for 
anything.

The body, the body, the body, the body, the body.

The filtering is double-filtering, standard, or tangent substitution in 
the last section of the video. The last section in particular presents a 
repetitive sweeping of the body


Natural Beginnings


"Tirelessly the process of thinking makes new beginnings, returning in a 
roundabout way to its original object. This continual pausing for breath 
is the mode most proper to the process of contemplation." 
(Walter Benjamin, The Origin of German Tragic Drama)
language begins with gesture, as Tran duc Thao would have it
gesture transforms into energy at a distance
scars carry the history of the body into the symbolic
power of gesture transformed by resonant body
time of private transactions
gesture carries language away from material worlds
scars disappear when bodies sink into the ikonic
publics blindly watch movements when none exist
language ends with gesture's blind wall away from material worlds
worlds are natural worlds and disappearing foams
symbolic is only a memory
symbolic is only a memory now and then
all bodies are resonant, extruded, and presencing
all bodies are bodies now and then


Let's begin.

Let's begin with the idea of reassemblage, structure of new identity, new 
equalization between A and A; let us use the sign ~ for identity, i.e. A~A 
reading as A is identical to A. Let's think of this in the true world, as 
dynamic process, something Whitehead pointed out years ago; in this case, 
A~A is temporally dependent; what act _identitizes,_ constructs the 
perception of the object on both sides of the sign? In reassemblage, this 
video for example, _humans_ are still, stillborn; immobile, they refuse 
appearance on both sides of ~; they're unary, full of digital equivalence 
but nothing else.

In reassemblage, this video for example, the subject, that is the viewer, 
is produced in the midst of a mirrored hall which deconstructs as it 
reveals; what move, what apparently move, are bodies filtered and re- 
filtered, beginning with the bvh (biovision hierarchy) files of a dynamic 
lacrosse player; the dynamism of such a player is embodied in the static 
file which produces, at the other end of the transmission, a simulacrum of 
dynamism.

Let us attach this movement to two bodies and two movements, and let the 
bodies reconstruct from other memories, of two dancers embodied as one 
with a third biovision file; let these memories produce stills modified by 
suturing software constructing final objects attached to and replacing 
anatomical parts of mannequins which are the first two bodies. So there 
are four or six bodies: two separate bodies of the dynamism of a lacrosse 
player, each with attachments constructed from numerous bodies temporally 
sliced but configured from the choreography of two dancers.

Let us begin then with reassemblage, a placement as if upon the originary 
scene of two dancers, in fact two other dancers, who appear as if lifelike 
in background; upon this, let us assemble the deconstruction of the appar- 
atus described in the previous paragraph, an assemblage that demands 
reassemblage on the part of the subject-viewer. One might think of this as 
an analogic/analog background of inert substance, as if there were no 
editing in the digital image-photograph, no punctum - both of which appear 
clearly upon close viewing. And against this analogic/analog background, 
think of the assemblage-in-need-of-reassemblage as imaginaries of dance 
and lacrosse, dance surmounted onto lacrosse, captured or seized by 
lacrosse. These imaginaries are productions solely of the discrete or 
digital (here used somewhat synonymously); they might-as-well-have-been 
assembled in another way, or an augmented or diminished or otherwise 
filtered way, or a foreign way altogether, not at all related, just as the 
discrete towards a jump cut promises or is premised upon the potential for 
anything appearing on the other side of the river, most likely not the 
river but an element taken from elsewhere, an otherwise element, foreign 
and unaccounted-for element, an uncounted element in fact. So this 
discrete appears to produce within the viewing, the need for reassemblage, 
the lowering of anomaly, something to make sense of it all. And it's 
clearly produced with a configuration or armature pre-determined; there's 
something of human bodies there, something of embeddings and prosthetics. 
Who does this predetermining, what are the compressions, the protocols, 
the exemplary decisions as to the parameters required in the construct of 
a maquette-mannequin?

Here, in other words, is the history of the fecund universe parlaying 
among subjects and objects, melding and obfuscating divisions until, like 
the sleazy or tawdry processes they might as well be, everything becomes 
simultaneously messay and true world and here, in other anysigns, or none 
at all, they are.

From the Secret Cluster

Legacy as these machines transmit in less than a second more than I can 
write in a lifetime.


Everything and nothing is there; code transmutes through sound and an 
analogic process of integration within which the constant C ensures that 
nothing is interpretable.

Legacy as my code disappears through miasma.
Legacy through corruption of code.

The sounds turn out to be modem-based; there are new recordings directly 
opposite the cluster room, against the locked doors and various security 
barriers.

Science 29 February 2008, 1209, Seth Lloyd, Quantum Information Matters:
"One bit corresponds to an amount of entropy equal to kH times the loga- 
rithm of 2. Planck's paper established that th euniverse was, at bottom, 
digital." Then abjection = abjection at the limit of the digital; analog 
is that uneasiness of substance riding on the digital, denying it within 
the imaginary / uncanny. Or rather the analog is that smearing of wave 
phenomena corroding the digital. Or... The article is fundamental; check 
it out. "The fact that simulating the entire universe requires a quantum 
computer as big as the universe should not stand in our way!"

Since for the Death remeid is none, 
Best is that we for Death dispone,
After our death that live may we:--

in the grips of the true world


from one scale to another, from human to true world, from mind to emanent. 
entities are present within the true world filtered through the history of 
ties, around emanents and 'true worlds,' around edge phenomena 

distorted worlding, 'bringing one out of the true world' (etc.) what con- 
stitutes the true world? worlding? 'true world' in which lines/angles are 
'trued' (affine geometry), 'true world' in the sense of 'trued' phen omen- 
ologies within which reflects real unclarity, the house of the world, 
transforming the world and the true world into praxis and real difference. 
and there's truth to this. least, when the true world is considered, em- 
anent and organism are intermingled, interpenetrated, within them, they 
are true-world true world?

carnated/carnal/knowledge - we could begin by introducing the true world, 
primordial, in other words backgrounding. in this sense, the true world is 
materialist; how the limits of my body within the true world are the 
limits of my world; thought and the true world are based on extrapolation 
- the gestural - from conglomerations, inherings, coherings among discrete 
and analog, abject.

 how are these constituted within the true world (another metaphor?)?  
language is clothed, associated with the true world. nevertheless both 
inhabit the true world, mind inhabits both, albeit often virtual within, 
inhering to the true world. striated, variegated, constructed, both 
thinging and orgasm, wryting into the body of the true world, wryting 
everywhere.

 what constitutes the true world? worlding?

 'true world' in which lines/angles are 'trued' (affine geometry),

 'true world' in the sense of 'trued' phenomenologies within which all 
worlds are not true worlds, all true worlds are worlding. ikonic signs 
inhere within the true world, reading bodies (organisms, emanents, approp- 
riated, misappropriated) are ikonic. true world - the body standing land- 
scapes of decoding, tendencies and tending of the true world sending 
thick-skins, true world of inhering/cohering skins. it is not communality 
(nothing is accountable). the 'worldview' stemming from the true world is 
symbol, index, chora, self, selving, others, worlds, worlding, world, just 
as anything in the true world replaces anysign - the poetics of the true 
world, all this skittering, dark matter. messy, inhering, worlding within. 
we can't stop now, bodies in space surrounded by symbolic fields, field- 
ing, motilities, evanescences, emptiness. we have the true world just 
beyond the space of the proscenium, meaning. but then, the shell ... yes, 
what we call ghosts are only these slid the real, the real is a shadow of 
the virtual, and within the true world messay, future genres which seeping 
into one another, true world of emanents and anysign where we're living, 
breathing, writing and strange, out there, within, structure paralleling 
our own. true world is the mattering/nattering to and among us, and we 
have to mess airless realm, the unintended or intentionless realm, in the 
true world realm, insertion in other words, an reading as a is identical 
to a. let's think of this in the true world, as simultaneously messay and 
true world and here, in other anysigns, or none, nothing, no sign at all, 
or, inclusive, signlessness.


The true world

"true," "world" without capitalization, small, backgrounding. "true world" 
without - connectivity, a tiny, almost insignificant phrase, completion 
phase emptying itself out. 

the true world is skeining, inscribing, quantum, cohering, inhering; the 
true world is image imaginary; the true world is aggregative, confluence; 
the true world is emptiness unemptied; the true world is emanent, real
virtual, virtual real; the true world is unreading, is scribbling, is 
inscribing under erasure; the true world is the immensity of the true 
world; the true world is deferring; the true world is always, is always 
already; the true world is catastrophe theory catastrophic; the true world 
is analog abject, fissured, indiscrete, analog intrusions, discrete extru- 
sions; the true world is imaginary carapace; the true world is neither 
this nor that, not both this and that; the true world is unaccountable, 
unaccounted-for, of no account; the true world the true world the true 
world.


imaginary world


imaginary world inhabits true world. true world is neither true nor false 
(nor much of anything). think:

competing neural regimes < self/I > < discrete representations > data- 
substance

or beginning with neural flux (within which the discrete emerges): neural 
regimes collapse (think of catastrophe theory short-cuts) 

what is the I but linguistic shifter/generator (therefore one might say 
_the_ linguistic shifter): here's your coagulation, assignment, direct 
address (think of direct address as proper name or natural kind). what 
emerges from the buzz of the world: discrete representations, _as if_ 
coagulations from the O/other side. what is absent: the buzz, neural 
networking/phase transitions (quantum on up) producing information vis- 
a-vis the _subject_ (I as subject, subjected-to). 

collapse is to the discrete, intensification, as if essence were culled. 
the buzz tends always on the far or lower side towards decay, corrosion, 
defuge, subject, subjected-to abjection. on the upper side, discretion, 
competition, processes surfacing when necessary, pulled from or by the 
buzz - buzz equivalent to the superstructure of the world. 

the true world appears with the removal of the lens from the eye and the 
subsequent temporal split, redefined as inscription. or not. 

consider the  < self/I > < discrete representations > as the _waist_ of
the buzz - any narrower and the system (channel, spew, flux) collapses.
think of < self/I/discrete representations > as _body._ then perhaps
neural regimes < body > data-substance. it is not too far an extension:

< < neural regimes / body > < body / data-substance > >; since this is
metaphor, not mathesis, it bifurcates into two models:

a. < neural regimes / body / data-substance > (within which body includes
an imaginary> and

b. < neural regimes / data-substance > (mixed epistemologies/ontologies of 
true world inscriptive processes, demateriality, emphasis on gestural 
logics, emptiness).

thus materiality is the available technology of true world. materiality 
occurs within the waist: this is the 'level' or holon of every-day life.

[ 'true world' is misnomer: it implies duality, rectitude, the purity of 
'the fragility of good things,' ration, logic, ratio. misnomer: it implies 
world, totality, absolute, one, monad, null, emptiness, range, closed 
manifold, language, planet. misnomer: 'it' referencing the discontinuity 
of the phrase, seepage, placement, shifter, particle, production. 'true 
world' is placeholder under erasure, sentence-space. 'true world' is 
neither true nor world, full or empty, fecundity or emptiness, creation or 
annihilation, creativity or death, negation. 'true world' is neither 
neitherness nor neither-both-a-and-b, i.e. sheffer-stroke and its dual. 
'true world' however does not inhabit or draw forth negation. what a 
mixture of writing and substance, virtual space and time, abject plasma, 
inconceivable corrosion, loss of bodies, inscribed and uninscribed 
slaughters turned around, inverted, con-figuration, cul-location. 'true 
world' is the flattened world, defuge, what happens after after hours 
happens all the time. ]

( 'true world': find another phrase. )

"We must therefore recognize that what is designated by the terms 
'glance,' 'hand,' and in general 'body' is a system of systems devoted to 
the inspection of a world and capable of leaping over distances, piercing 
the perceptual future, and outlining hollows and reliefs, distances and 
deviations--a meaning--in the inconceivable flatness of being. The move- 
ment of the artist tracing his arabesque in infinite matter amplifies, but 
also prolongs, the simple marvel of oriented motion or grasping movements. 
Already in its pointing gestures the body not only flows over into a world 
whose schema it bears in itself but possesses the world at a distance 
rather than being possessed by it." (Merleau Ponty, Signs)

What is the form of finalgame? It may be proffered as a Poser 7 file for 
download, manipulation; it may consist of a series of images your or I 
might produce with Poser 7; it may be an exemplary video such as 
finalgame.mp4 or less compressed, finalgame.avi; in any case it is a 
dynamic object, four-dimensional, used either for further manipulation on 
the part of the viewer/subject, or for re-presentation in any number of 
media, after such manipulation. Codework and dynamics interpenetrate.

Now in finalgame, three doubled motion capture files (each produced by two 
humans simultaneously inhabiting varied elements of a single body) are 
combined to provide emanent momentum; the emanent itself is composed of 
three temporal sequences transformed into dynamic objects: 1. Single 
images of a lacrosse player in 'typical' game poses; 2. Multiple 'snaps' 
of a lacrosse player in a set of poses, combined into a single dynamic 
object; and 3. A single 'snap' taken over six minutes of a woman walking 
back and forth in front of the scanner. The first corresponds to a 
traditional painting or photograph; the second to animation deconstructed; 
and the third to both radar and other scans of dynamic behavior, and the 
deconstructed psychology of internal time consciousness. These dynamic 
objects are carapaces replacing the 'human' avatar elements of the emanent 
who now wears time.

In divas, three to four motion capture files are simultaneously graphed 
and played on a single grid; each of the files again is produced by two 
humans simultaneously. The style is that of the DIVA viewer; the motions 
construct communal interaction as doubly-inhabited bodies are situated 
within the playing field.

In both videos there are varying interrelationships among single actants, 
multiple actants, multiple sequences, and dual 'inhabitations' of a single 
behavioral matrix.


death and time's death

one temporality juggles and jumbles another, but when is this occurrence; 
to the extent that temporality, time, is a representation, it's bound by 
ordinary linear sequencing in much the same way that deontic or fuzzy 
logics are bound by binary logic; a fuzzy formula might hold some of the 
time for example but then this might holding would be suspect to true or 
false, would it not? just so everything devolves around the dyadic of 
representations of discrete phenomena. one cannot escape death, even in a 
digital realm where time clashes against time, time and again: first, the 
sequence is technology-dependent for implementation; second, it cannot 
retard the hastening of death for the subject - creator or viewer; third 
it always flies to an end as the machine is cut off or the sequence is 
relatively short and unlooped. what's constructed is a myth, the myth, as 
in Michael Snow, of the continuously walking woman - a myth which is 
remarkably fragile, unstable; even in sequence.mp4 she moves through a 
limited number of presentations, the scan happening to catch her at 
various moments across the field. she moves and continues to move, and, 
Muybridge-like, the assumption is that the spaces between frames or states 
is filled. in sequence.mp4, however, there is no filling, everything 
re/presents itself within the single frame, already the harbinger of death 
and movement's cessation.


Flesh of the world -- Flesh of the body -- Being
                                                             May, 1960

 _Flesh of the world,_ described (apropos of time, space, movement) as 
segregation, dimensionality, continuation, latency, encroachment -- -- 
Then interrogate once again these phenomena-questions: they refer us to 
the perceiving-perceived _Einfuhlung,_ for they mean that we are already 
_in_ the being thus described, that we _are of it,_ that between it and us 
there is _Einfuhlung_
 That means that my body is made of the same flesh as the world (it is a 
perceived), and moreover that this flesh of my body is shared by the 
world, the world _reflects_ it, encroaches upon it and it encroaches upon 
the world (the felt [_senti_] at the same time the culmination of subject- 
ivity and the culmination of materiality), they are in a relation of 
transgression or of overlapping -- -- This also means: my body is not only 
one perceived among others, it is the measurant (_measurant_) of all, 
_Nullpunkt_ of all the dimensions of the world.

[...]

 The _touching itself, seeing itself_ of the body is itself to be under- 
stood in terms of what we said of the seeing and the visible, the touching 
and the touchable.  Ie. it is not an act, it is a being at (etre a).

- Merleau-Ponty, The Visible and the Invisible, from the Working Notes


of there to here as not both here and here, neither here nor here -- -- 
"my body is made of the same flesh as the world" - incipient accumulative 
processes, no differing among real and virtual, prim and corporeality, 
tissue and organ -- emanent life, emanent living -- 


Haunt


In formal logic, a contradiction is the signal of a defeat: but in the
evolution of real knowledge it marks the first step in progress towards a
victory.

(Whitehead, Science and The Modern World)

   Like waves that rise on the ocean stirred by the wind, dancing, and
without interruption,
   The Alaya-ocean in a similar manner is constantly stirred by the winds
of objectivity, and is seen dancing about with the Vijnanas which are the
waves of multiplicity.

(Lankavatara Sutra, trans. Suzuki)


Experiment solitary touching appetite of union in bodies.


 293. It is certain that in all bodies there is an appetite of union, and 
evitation of solution of continuity; and of this appetite there be many 
degrees; but the most remarkable, and fit to be distinguished, are three. 
The first in liquors; the second in hard bodies; and the third in bodies 
cleaving or tenacious. In liquors this appetite is weak; we see in liquors 
the threading of them in stillicides (as hath been said); the falling of 
them in round drops (which is the form of union); and the staying of them 
for a little time in bubbles and froth. In the second degree or kind, this 
appetite is strong; as in iron, in stone, in wood, &c. In the third, this 
appetite is in a medium between the other two: for such bodies do partly 
follow the touch of another body, and partly stick and continue to 
themselves; and therefore they rope, and draw themselves in threads; as we 
see in pitch, glass, birdlime, &c. But note, that all solid bodies are 
cleaving, more or less; and that they love better the touch of somewhat 
that is tangible, than of air. For water, in small quantity, cleaveth to 
any thing that is solid; and so would metal too, if the weight drew it not 
off. And therefore gold foliate, or any metal foliate, cleaveth: but those 
bodies which are noted to be clammy and cleaving, are such as have a more 
indifferent appetite (at once) to follow another body, and to hold to 
themselves. And therefore they are commonly bodies ill mixed: and which 
take more pleasure in a foreign body, than in preserving their own 
consistence; and which have little predominance in drought or moisture.

(from Francis Bacon, Sylva Sylvarum: or A Natural History, 1627)

( think of electrick fluid, magnetism, electrostaticks; think of mud or 
other problematic 'objects' in Plato; of abjection; of Kristeva's Powers 
of Horror; of Being and Nothingness (last sections); of the analogick; of 
substance and its uncanniness; of the discrete and its imaginary. this has 
always been with us, think of Visuddhimagga, highest tantra, think of 
purification rites, scapegoats, abjections, dis/ease, dis/comfort, think 
of anything unthought ... )

everyone a multiplicity, here's a community for you: internal, what goes 
on outside the heart or cocoon is ruined, is nourishment, sustenance left 
alone. jennifer conforms to travis, nikuko and julu inhabit travis, travis 
is blind in one eye, lame in one foot, stumbles, churns, girls girls girls 
girls, now we're inside all of them, they don't breath, they're in vacuum, 
they're running the show, they are the show. analog and digital meat 
sutured by the abject, digital flees, analog embraces, there's a smell 
about them, you listen to the scent, hearing's left to you above the well 
of tinnitus.

digital doesn't flee, digital is fled, we're sorry about forces beyond our 
control. analog curdles, digital extrudes; analog corrodes, digital 
cleans, analog says

analog says travis and julu are used up
analog says jennifer and nikuko are used up
digital says travis and nikuko are hyperrealisms
digital says jennifer and julu are hyperrealisms

(laughtrack: analog says bite me, digital says byte me)

Nikuko and Travis: We're used and abused.
Nikuko and Travis: We love it. Look, sores. Look, wounds, scars, tattoos.
Jennifer and Julu: We're clean. We wash our cocks. We wash our cunts.
Jennifer and Julu: Look, shiny prims, texture-maps, clean all the way 
down.

Nikuko and Travis beg Jennifer and Julu to abuse them.
Jennifer and Julu control Nikuko and Travis. They say:

Jennifer and Julu: Clean yourselves, you dirty boys!
Jennifer and Julu: Clean yourselves, you dirty girls!

Travis: We're boys, boys, boys, boys, boys.
Nikuko and Jennifer and Julu: We're girls, girls, girls, girls, girls.

digital, analog dancing inside it. i, alan sondheim, wrote them. i, alan 
sondheim, told them to do it. i told them to do this and that. i told them 
to keep their eyes and ears shut. i told them to look elsewhere, hear 
nothing, see nothing. i told them they smelled. i told them they had to 
smell, had to smell as hard as possible, had to leave trails, had to leave 
dampness, had to be moist, wet up there, wet down there. they said, they 
said, nothing but dryness, nothing stays wet, we're in vacuum, you can't 
hear us, you can hardly see us. 

(laughtrack: i said listen, they said glisten)

now we will go for a swim says jennifer, i will wet myself and swim inside 
myself. now i will swim in you says travis, look you are all wet. now we 
move just like one, just like another, just like another. oh i forgot says 
nikuko, julu is our other, julu is our other mother, no says julu, travis 
is our other mother, no no says travis. no says nikuko, jennifer is our 
other mother, no says jennifer, nikuko is our other travis, no says julu, 
jennifer is our other nikuko, and we will play here

we will play where no one comes no one bothers, no one bothers to come, no 
one bothers us. we are all wet up there and down there, before there and 
beyond there, up here and down here, beyond here and before here, and to 
the sides, yes says jennifer, to the sides also, yes says travis, to the 
sides as well. 

we will talk and we will say hello hello, we are very tiny
we will say hello hello hello, we will live forever
we will say hello, we are very tiny and we will live forever


courtship displays of the manifolds: 


coagulation or cohesion of elements, fold-catastrophic jumps, convulsions, 
collocations, substructural part-objects, articulations; bendings, affine 
and other morphological transformations.

from one end of the spectrum, the schrodinger cat paradox resolves as 
leakage, what i'd term abjection, in relation to container and thinging 
contained; from the other, it makes no difference since particles _jump,_ 
not to mention coordinations at distances, etc. it's almost code, codons. 
it's almost discrete, symbolic. it breaks down only where the continuum 
appears, continuity at the periphery. another tactic, that of binary 
particle, that of continuous wave. or does the wave become discrete or 
broth, roiled. modes of string vibrations. think of dimensional collapse 
as the real. 

think of this as _metaphor-engine,_ nothing more, swamped by ignorance. 
think of mathesis among continuums and anything mapped where, surreal or 
other numbers, integers; are natural numbers _natural_? thinned line or 
stepping among infinitesimals. 


An emblem


analog--abject (hidden <> flight) flesh silence | {stench, odor}
                 emptiness mind
discrete--pure (visible <> embrace) mind speech | {scent, smell)

Let analog resonate 0, that is substance with no premise, project. Let 
discrete resonate 1, that is inscription with project, maintenance. Think 
analog resonating nothing, discrete resonating. Then _1_ draws _0_ out. 
The Emblem is always discrete, the analog(ic) always approached asymptot- 
ically, from the other side. Analog as release of emblem, discrete as 
emblematic release.

The abject of the analog is hidden (passively or actively); it harbors 
flight, flight-from skittered across substance surface, flight-towards 
oozed beneath it. The abject is desired, uninscribed death, defuge. And 
that is what there is.

Analogic: of the flesh, stench, silence, noise, parasite, emptiness of 
mind.

The visible of the analog is embraced (passively or actively), embrace- 
from as inscription, isolation, purification, distanced, the blemish of 
the body in-visible, sutured over, cosmeticized, cover-up. And embrace- 
towards, arousal within the visible, inscribed and introjected objects- 
objectifications. And that is what there is.

Discrete: of speech, discursivity, talk, fecundity of mind.

Among visible and abject, emptiness.
Among analog and discrete, emptiness.
Analog and discrete sutured at the limits--the inscription of analogic, 
abjection of discrete. Culture exists, exhausts, exhumes, at the junction; 
the junction is driven by impulse, exchange and use values (regimes), 
arousal, rite, contract, the letter, annihilation. The letter is always 
under erasure, granular, memory.

(_Desire_ of flight and embrace.)

On _the one hand_ dyads are always suspect, problematic, under erasure, 
abject; _on the other_ dyads are originary _wherever, whenever there is 
origin._ Think of _originary fields,_ not points; areas, not vectors; 
temporalities, not time; infinitesimals, not 0. Think of emission and 
absorption spectra; particle annihilation and creation: "The world is 
_not_ locally realistic." (Nielsen and Chuang, Quantum Computation and 
Quantum Information.)

Breathless


Julu: Hello Nikuko, you are looking wonderful this very morning.
Nikuko: Hello Julu, why you are looking odd I do think!
Julu: My eye disappears from my head I think, this is no wonderful thing!
Nikuko: I did not say this is wonderful to have an eye disappear!
Julu: And my leg too hanging by a thread! Nikuko, where are you?
Nikuko: Oh dear you are half-blind Julu! 
Julu: You may call me Half-Blind Julu! But I am all blind Nikuko!
Nikuko: You are all blind? You are All-Blind-Julu?
Julu: And you are All-Blind-Nikuko!
Nikuko: What, I am all blind?
Julu: Can you see anything here? Can you see anything at all?
Nikuko: I hear your voice!
Julu: Say something, anything!
Nikuko: I can see perfectly well, Harold.
Julu: I have all my limbs, Maud. Do let me adjust myself.
Nikuko: I am absolutely blind here. Further, I cannot hear anything.
Julu: Further, I cannot breathe and I do not have diabetes.
Nikuko: And yet...
Julu: And yet I have gout, do I not.
Nikuko: You do not, Julu, you do not have anything!
Julu: Maud, you must move slightly to your left, thank you.
Nikuko: Harold, I will not budge an inch!
Julu: Maud, you are not looking properly or you would move!
Nikuko: I am looking just fine, thank you!
Julu: As I said I cannot breathe and there is no air here.
Nikuko: There's nothing to look at anyway!
Julu: You're not even trying!
Nikuko: I am so, I'm trying as hard as you are!
Julu: You aren't even mouthing anything! Stop twisting!
Nikuko: I am losing all my limbs! I absolutely am!
Julu: Adjust yourself!
Nikuko: I am adjusting and adjusting myself! I can't adjust more!
Julu: You are adjusting yourself in a very wrong way!
Nikuko: What time is it? Look at me, what time is it?
Julu: It is 10:30 and you have just lost your head!
Nikuko: Ha ha ha I have lost my head over you!
Julu: ADJUST YOURSELF!
Nikuko: Why Harold what ever is the matter?
Julu: Maud I need a time out! I have lost my leg!
Nikuko: And I have lost my cunt!
Julu: I have lost mine too!
Nikuko: Now we will sing a very sad song about losing things!
Julu and Nikuko:
 Alone among the prims
 We have lost our limbs!
 We cannot ride the course
 When we have lost our horse!
 Take back the day and night!
 Restore to us our sight!
 Look at us when we beg,
 Please return our leg!
Julu: No one will take us serious!
Nikuko: We must appear delirious!
Julu: This world is far too hazy!
Nikuko: You must think we're crazy!
Julu: Now we will sit down in a muddle-puddle and think about things!
Nikuko: Why hello Jennifer, do come join us this fine summer day!
Jennifer: I would love to play today, I say, I'll stay!
Julu: And hello Travis, and how are you?
Travis: Why hello Julu and Nikuko! I have lost my eye, my cock, my leg!
Nikuko: It must be a thing going around.
Julu: There's no other explanation!
Jennifer: Yes, a thing! I've lost my head over it!
Nikuko: We've already said that one!
Jennifer: But it's true! I've lost my head! I'm dead, I said!
Nikuko: Maud, spread out a little!
Julu: Harold, For once tighten up!
Jennifer: I'm dead! I'm dead cold and I'm dead!
Travis: I'm breathless!
Nikuko: You can't breathe anyway!
Julu: You can't breathe at all!

Jennifer and Julu: Two Important Announcements!
Nikuko and Travis: What?! What?!
Jennifer and Julu:
 Shepherdstown - Once Mecklenberg. Settlements about 1719,
 Named for Thomas Shepherd, its founder, and incorporated
 in 1762. First church (Presbyterian), west of the Blue
 Ride was here. First W. Va. newspaper, 1790. First W. Va.
 post office, 1792. Jefferson Co. - W Va. 45 and W Va. 48
Nikuko: Terribly wonderful! Terribly terribly wonderful!
Travis: Yes, wonderfully terrible! Truly a chasm chiasm!
Jennifer and Julu: And now for the second ...
 They shoot the flying, chase the running, expose the hiding,
 surprise nestlings, close up entrance holes, upset nests,
 injure the pregnant, and break the egg.
Nikuko and Travis: Yes, they do! They do!
Jennifer and Julu: And furthermore ...
 Ice Mountain - Huge natural refrigerator, five miles north
 along North River, where ice is found for several hundred
 yards on the hottest summer days. Raven Rock, on North
 Mountain, offers one of the finest views in West Virginia.
 Hampshire Co. - U. S. 50 and W Va. 45 at junction.
Nikuko: That is so complete, so amazingly complete!
Travis: Yes, complete more than that, even more!
Jennifer: Now we will be very silent
Julu: and listen to the sound of our own hearts' beating.
Nikuko: Alas, we hear nothing!
Travis: Alas, we hear nothing at all!

Logout / Fallout


(I'm speaking about 'logout' much as 'fallout' at the ELO conference this 
week; below is the text that inspired the videos, which will 'represent' 
me (as well as either Skype or SL) there, since I don't have enough funds 
to travel. Logout as fallout - the metaphor isn't mentioned below, but 
in/forms like all radiations. In modernity, premodernity, whatever, on/off 
was well-defined, even with the corrosion of axiomatic mathesis i.e. 
Tarski, Godel, Skolem, Church, etc.; a light-switch turned something on, 
then off - a light-switch in other words is a simple memory on the 
occasion of a single bit. Today, computers are left running, identities 
are stolen, one might jackin, jackoff, one machine or body, then another; 
micro-controllers run continuously just like computer locks or whatever 
holds volatile memory in check; one might login with several identities, 
etc. On a MOO, when one left, the avatar body went to a body bag; on SL, 
unless otherwise accounted for, the body disappears. Now, the virtual body 
or emanent is also the real physical body in the true world; login/logout 
are blips or momentary interruptions in redirected consciousnesses. This 
radiation treatment holds for the post-industrialized world at best; let's 
not make too much of this momentary ontology/epistemology. We're jackedin 
jackedout - we flicker, we're flicker-consumers in fact and fancy and the 
imaginary as bandwidths appear to increase and we can't get enough of 
either each other, our movies, our games, our entertainments. Earthquakes 
and monsoons crash-land the true world in the true world, crash-land 
bodies and emanents equally, however you divide your categories.)

"Logging out"
Abstract: Alan Sondheim will demo. Leaving site behind, physically,
electronically, psychoanalytically, electrically, socially, exhaustively.

Logout is the collapse of _ascence_ (Jon Marshall's term for the problem- 
atic of neither present nor absent on an email list); it signals a change- 
of-state of the ab/user (carpal tunnel, exhaustion, boredom, orgasm, task 
completion, defuge): LOGOUT IS EQUIVALENT TO DEATH UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

I'M NOT HERE. I NEVER HAVE BEEN HERE.

Logout is cutoff, absolute split. A logout inscribes an absolute inscrip- 
tion: A|B, let's say Sheffer stroke NOT BOTH A AND B - which doesn't mean 
for example that there's not a C such that A and C in a rather abject or 
messy fashion. You're either online or offline, one way or another:

On the other hand you might keep the machine running, what of that? And 
you're logged in, jacked in, permanently, but you're not there, not there 
at all.

Defuge sets in; you're exhausted with the possibilities, they don't mean 
anything to you, you're taking a trip somewhere, the machine's left 
behind, still on, humming away...

Or bravo, someone's stolen your identity, now you're logged in, there's an 
id number, maybe parent and root, 
sondheim:*:4564:99:Alan Sondheim:/net/u/6/s/sondheim:/usr/local/bin/ksh
maybe something else, who or what is that thing, bot, that's running the 
thing. Maybe I sign off Second Life or a MOO and you'll find me in a body 
bag, maybe I'm still there, maybe I'm still around not logged out at all.

It's all a mess, WHERE ARE YOU in Facebook, MySpace? Increasingly YOU 
remain logged in, beyond the machine; you remain there, transfixed, your 
passwords and names in login memory.

Debris: You don't logout, you wither: Consider all those remnants of MOO 
objects that remained years after the user's disappeared. Cyberspace fills 
with debris; THE DEBRIS IS YOU and each and every Other. 

Culture is never as clean as it seems to be, and this unseemliness is the 
fundamental character of culture.

THE MACHINE IS ALWAYS ON

ii.

Think of on/off as intrinsic to inscription, fundamental to dyadic phenom- 
enology to the extent that one can consider dyads as _processes,_ the 
production of x|~x for example. This inscription is characteristic of org- 
anisms in general (see Heinz von Foerster); one might locate the ego at 
the hinge or juncture. The juncture configures, emits, spews meaning; 
inscriptions must be maintained. Thus an on-switch, logon, requires power 
for its continuance (yes, this is elemenatary); logoff, beyond the immin- 
ent action, construes annihilation. There is no guarantee that one who has 
logged off will log on again. And as we have seen, logon figures presence, 
which is demarcated; logoff figures nothing; this parallels the idea of 
'the fragility of good things' in catastrophe theory - there are many more 
ways for things to fail, than to succeed. 

I want to point out here the debt to Hermann Weyl, who located the last 
remnants of the ego at the juncture of coordinate axes in physics - i.e. 
the placement of an origin or null point, which is arbitrary and conven- 
tional and points to nothing more than a (theoretical) placement by a 
sentient being - "I say, things begin here," so to speak, whether zero or 
Jerusalem.

It's the ego, sentience, that holds inscription, on-off, together. But 
everything corrodes, decays, dis/eases, dis/appears. I'd argue that such, 
this regime of abjection, is fundamental to the world, ("Get lost and 
die.") at least the world as we know it. Log in to the digital, out to the 
analog; in to neural networking, out to the plain. 

The ego gets lost in _the process._
