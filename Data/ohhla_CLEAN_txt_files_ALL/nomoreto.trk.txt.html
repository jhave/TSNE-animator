[Intro: Trick-Trick]
You know what the days of talkin is over
It ain't too much mo' we can say
to try to get these, different individuals
Or motherfuckers as I like to call 'em
To just, shut the fuck up
Let's go

[Trick-Trick]
You witnessed the ass whoopin, bones got broke
When the .50-cal blast, couldn't last through the smoke
As you choke, pay attention, bear winess to this motherfucker twitchin
You excited cause none of the bullets hit you, they missed you
And we ain't trippin, wasn't after you
But you PISSED, just like a bitch when niggaz laughed at you
Now you agitated a little bit, actin just like a little bitch
I figured that you would surface and knew you happened to manage to pop shit
Sayin "Trick that, Trick this"
When the balls that you had left when I popped him
You shoulda died with him, body and soul coulda burned
I'ma keep killin these bitches 'til everybody learn
FUCK time, and it's time these fuckers just start dyin
I ain't sayin this for sake of this rhyme, and I ain't LYIN
I'm man enough to say it and mean it, niggaz can be gone
I'ma do another verse but it ain't much more I can SPEAK on!

[Chorus: Eminem]
There's nothin more these words can say (can say)
This hard-headed motherfucker just won't let it lay (let it lay)
So say a prayer for this player cause he's goin to his grave (to his grave)
So stand clear, bitches better get the fuck out my way (my way)

[Proof]
Let me show you how I started as a starvin artist
This is Proof with the truth regardless of all this (for real)
As my CEO and best friend of the essence
of why nobody in Detroit wan' test him (huh?)
Lesson learned, flesh get burned
Tecs in turn, a scar harder than a press and burn
Everlast the beef is over, you can sleep this over
Clique been filled the streets with soldiers
Includin me, I move and creep with uzi fleets
that choose to lead, I'll put your dudes to sleep
Who is he? (Trick!) Trick, no treat
That street life, AK that still'll lift your feet (blaow!)
The rest of these niggaz is comical, I'ma go abdominal
Split like a domino, rhymin pro
Shine without a diamond, go Geronimo to any man with balls
Murder you bitches, still screamin "FUCK the law!"

[Chorus]

[Trick-Trick]
Since talkin about it is considered as conversation
then I'm more than HAPPY to be the sponsor of demonstrations
From beatin these cases to bustin in faces and bustin these K's
Niggaz gon' act like they don't wanna act right
FUCK THAT! Had to begin settin the trend
of organizin a mob, and bringin it to an end
The levels of toleration'll cease, for givin passes
That's why my reputation precedes for beatin asses
Entertainers, they take it as a joke and they tend to provoke
an up-and-comin undergrad; motherfuckers got me mad
Fuck it, I'ma give it to 'em if you really gon' do 'em
If this motherfucker even BLINKS, put a clip into him
Don't even think of negotiatin a treaty
The reason most of these niggaz is hatin is cause they greedy
Uncovered another man's SHIT, now that's a real bitch
Now the NEXT motherfucker gon' DIE, that's IT~!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Trick-Trick]
Kill one of you bitches</pre>
