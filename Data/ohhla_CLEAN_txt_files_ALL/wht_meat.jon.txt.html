[Eightball]
Full of all kinda drugs high as a giraffe
Pussy nigga better not get too close, Nigga better not try and push me
We got them thangs, I mean them thangs that go bang bang
Don't give a fuck who you with, don't give a fuck if you got some change
Take your necklace, take your watch, take your diamond rangs
Way back in the game, when a nigga use to have sell rock cocaine
Right now today, I'ma grab the mic and bring the pain
Go fucking insane, everything I say go straight to ya brain
Lil Jon on the beat, bout'a tear this bitch up out the frame
You better leave if you thing you just a little lame
Tuck your chain don't get caught when this here song come on
Look at my face, that's gon' tell you niggaz something wrong

[Chorus  8Ball, MJG, Lil Jon &amp; the ESBoys (8Ball &amp; MJG)
I heard you niggaz don't like me (like me)
I know you boys wanna fight me (fight me)
I know where your kids and yo wife be (wife be)
Buss a nigga head till da white meat (meat) 2X

[MJG]
Real killers, tough niggaz, loud mouth rough niggaz
Can't stay out'a handcuff niggaz ain't enough niggaz
Toughen up niggaz, I'm a, artillery specialist
Never da fucking less I get pimpin naturally effortless
Coming up outta regions where mu-a-fuckas is needin
MJG to speak for 'em, continue to see for 'em
I ran the street with 'em, concrete defeat with 'em
I made them hoes pick 'em, I made them go, stick 'em
Pimp tight, MJ, fucking GM, luckily
Married to this 45, under my fuckin seat
Talking, pullin pistols out and shootin never shook me
You boys can't hook me listen what the hook be

[Chorus]

[Lil Jon] (Lil Bo and Big Sam)
We ain't scared'a fuck niggaz, we ain't scared'a whole cliques
Fuck them niggaz, take they hoes, and they muthafuckin shit
	(fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, fuck em)
We ain't scared'a fuck niggaz, we ain't scared'a whole cliques
Fuck them niggaz, take they hoes, and they muthafuckin shit
	(fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, fuck em)
You think you bad nigga, (WHAT), You think you hard nigga, (WHAT)
Yo clique ain't shit, we pull your car nigga, (WHAT)
We shoot a bird at a pussy nigga, we roll on a pussy nigga
		(bird heeeeeeeeyyyyy)            (heeeeeeeeyyyy)
I don't give a fuck nigga, stole on that pussy nigga
	(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
We shoot a bird at a pussy nigga, we roll on a pussy nigga
			(bird heeeeeeeeyyyyy)            (heeeeeeeeyyyy)

	(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
[Chorus]
