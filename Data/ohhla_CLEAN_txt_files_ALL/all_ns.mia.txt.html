[Chorus 1]
All niggas buy for pussy, cried for pussy
Lied for pussy, live for pussy, steal for pussy
Snuck for pussy, killed for pussy
All niggas buy for pussy, cried for pussy
Lied for pussy, live for pussy, steal for pussy
Snuck for pussy, killed for pussy

[Chorus 2]
Who's the playa, who's the pimp, who's the mack
Push em' back, we need some elbow room, we need some elbow room
Don't sweat it
Who's the playa, who's the pimp, who's the mack
Push em' back, we need some elbow room, we need some elbow room
Don't sweat it, shake that ass, nigga work that back
Nigga rock that dick, you the bitch tonight
Nigga shake that ass, nigga work that back
Nigga rock that dick, you the bitch tonight nigga
Ah yeah, here we go in the place where the big lips at
Let me see ya face, uh
Fuck you right give us what we need
I'm talkin' to the niggas with the big cheese
Two minutes, Johnny come fast
Ain't no sense in fucking yo ass
Penny pinchers, Johnny too tight
Ain't no way you gon' fuck a TRU bitch tonight

[Verse 1]
Fuck them dog ass niggas they ain't workin'
Got a nine inch dick but what's the use if you can't work it
Wanna get it licked, bitch get ya mind right
Sweaty nuts still smelling like the last fuck
Hell naw this sister ain't got ya back
When bachelor pad is more like ya mama's couch
I passed on him again like I always do
Mama Mia got the razor-sharp lyrics nigga I thought you knew
I flow through five, violent niggas everyday
Flip scripts on tricks get the stuff and yay
My way all the time nigga ain't no doubt
Keep my pussy in ya mouth even at ya mom's house
Southside she-devil biggest mama sister of blessing
One whole, making sisters noid nigga
No figures no stickers, but you can for sho' lick us
From the tits to the clit, ass crack all day
It's the same shit you niggas like to floss
Knowin' you can't live without our draws
Boss bitches ain't no time for you to be dumb
If you ain't about getting no cash nigga you ain't the one

[Mia X singing]
Boy don't you call me if you ain't lickin' and giving money
If you ain't treating, no shopping spreesin'
Paying my car out and buying me a house
Boy don't you call me if you ain't lickin' and giving money
If you ain't treating, no shopping spreesin'
Paying my car out and buying me a house

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Mia X speaking]
For real, Mama Mia putting it down for sisters worldwide
I'm still in here representing hard than a motherfucker
Raw as a dog
I gotta send a special shout out to my hometown
Where this type of music come from, the N.O.
The Big Cheese, the dressing, New Orleans
We in here, uh</pre>
