Song:   This Kind of Lonely
Typed by: tim_timbo_2003@hotmail.com

Sitting alone tonight, rain falling on my window sill
Just wanna do what's right, but I don't know if I ever will
There's so many reasons, too many excuses
And all these prescriptions, got too many uses

I'm so lonely, it's kinda scary
This kind of lonely is making me weary
I'm so lonesome I could die

Sitting alone tonight, waiting for the sunshine
Sometimes I kneel and pray, hoping someday that you'll be mine
But she's so many miles away, I've got so many things to say
And all of the games we'd play don't matter anyway

Cause I'm so lonely, the sex is empty
This kind of lonely, it's so easy to tempt me
I'm so lonesome I could die, I'm so lonesome I could die

Sitting alone tonight, waiting for somebody to call
Think if I'm up and died would nobody notice at all
Cause I'm so insecure, and I feel so unsure
Can't take it anymore, it's never been like this before

And I'm so lonely, I feel like crying
This kind of lonely is worse than dying
I'm so lonesome I could die, I'm so lonesome I could die
I'm so lonesome I could die</pre>
