Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeaaaa, ladies and gentlemen (hahaha)
I'd like to welcome ya'll to the life of a star
Yea, a superstar that is
And that's me: Young Wizzle Man
Hahaha. Yea

Little nigga, big money, big dreams
Tall nigga, small nigga, big team
Small teeth, 501 fit jeans (fit jeans)
Some say my life can't be all that it seems (it seems)
Big things (big things)
Big hoes wanna go back to my spot, they say how my shit gleams (shit gleams)
Remember when I was a little nigga, fifteen (fifteen)
It's funny how I've grown, yea my money kinda long (kinda long, yea)
And ya girl know the words to every song (song)
Cause I'm a star (I'm a star)
Different week, ain't no tellin where we are (where we are)
You look up, I might be gone, yeaaa
The man pose to get that cash in (cash in)
Movin' I see through them lights flashin (flashin)
And no need to even ask it (naaaaww)
Fuck the world, live everyday like it's your last (last) yea (yea)

No matter where you go, they know who ya are (are, are, are)
Run up screamin cause they know you're a superstar (star, star, star, star, star)
You're a superstar (star, star, star, star, star)
You're a superstar (star, star, star)

Yea, got bright brown heart, got paper
Got in the game and got more haters (more haters)
My whole swag got grown, got Taylor'd (Taylor'd)
Hop on a plane and talk to ya'll later (yeaaaa)
It a good weed ma, that blunts not flavored
My whole gang, Gucci frame, Chuck Taylor's (Chuck Taylor's)
We ball hard like the majors (majors, majors)
Prolly cus we major (major, major)
You gon have to front page em
Wild, like a loose animal they wan cage em (cage em, cage em)
Now I amaze em,
Every time I enter a front center stage em (stage em, stage em)
Blame the nigga that pays em
Riding with a bitch, body on her that's Cajun
Couple hundred dollars on these Ed Hardy frames believe me
My future so bright, I need these, excuse me

No matter where you go, they know who ya are (are, are, are)
Run up screamin cause they know you're a superstar (star, star, star, star, star)
You're a superstar (star, star, star, star, star)
You're a superstar (star, star, star)</pre>
