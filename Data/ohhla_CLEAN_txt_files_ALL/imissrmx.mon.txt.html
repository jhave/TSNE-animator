[AZ]
I heard the word about you and that cat
Him trickin, playin fat, while you relax layin back
Dinin, v12 coupe, seat reclinin
Plottin revenge for when you claim I was playin games and lyin
Disrespectin
Hangin up phones when I call just to check-in
The cash had you gassed for a second
But you missin me, now
And I don't see how
The way you used to be foul
I guess you man is back in the penal

[Monifah]
Baby!
I been tossin, turnin all week long
From these lonely nights I'm spendin
And I know
I was wrong to let YOU go
Can't get you off my mind
Your loves the reason why
I think of the time we share
Me and you, together

[Monifah]
Baby come home
Come home to me, now
I miss you
Come give me what I'm missin
Baby come home
Come home to me, now
I need you
You're all that I've been missin

[Monifah]
I was wrong to let you go; boy now I know it's true
Let's talk about it
Cause baby, I miss you (miss you)
Day and night, all I do is think of you
I'm so alone
So baby, come home (I need you)
I think of the time we share
Me and you, together

[Monifah]
Baby come home
Come home to me, now
I miss you
Come give me what I'm missin

[AZ]
Sketch the gold seller, the Rockefeller, wit lots of mozzarella
Still never knock no cheddar, trynna have this locked forever
The king of Nazareth, livin lavish
Used to havin this, phat-to-death, plush, looking fabulous
Guess jeans, dressed, got me in (???)
For real tho
But still on the low, doin my thing
Blessed wit enlightment
Escapin secrete indictments
Movin unlicensed, wit a GS Lex wit light tints
Rollin large
Camouflaged, wit no regard
Playin hard, the god go against all odds
AZ, the winnin type, Cajun dinner type
I been blessed wit inner sight
Far as mics, I slide up in em right
Keep it tight
