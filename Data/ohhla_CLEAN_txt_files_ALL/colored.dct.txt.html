[1, 1, 1, 1... 2, 2, 2, 2... 3, 3, 3, 3... 4, 4, 4, 4]

Pardon me, your epidermis is showing, sir
I couldn't help but note your shade of melanin
I tip my hat to the colorful arrangement
Cause I see the beauty in the tones of our skin

We've gotta come together
And thank the maker of us all

[Chorus]
We're colored people, and we live in a tainted place
We're colored people, and they call us the human race
We've got a history so full of mistakes
And we are colored people who depend on a holy grace

[1, 1, 1, 1... 2, 2, 2, 2... 3, 3, 3, 3... 4, 4, 4, 4]

A piece of canvas is only the beginning for
It takes on character with every loving stroke
This thing of beauty is the passion of an artist's heart
By god's design, we are a skin kaleidoscope

We've gotta come together,
Aren't we all human after all?

[Chorus]

Ignorance has wronged some races
And vengeance is the lord's
If we aspire to share this space
Repentance is the cure

[1, 1, 1, 1... 2, 2, 2, 2... 3, 3, 3, 3... 4, 4, 4, 4]

Well, just a day in the shoes of a color blind man
Should make it easy for you to see
That these diverse tones do more than cover our bones
As a part of our anatomy

[Chorus]

We're colored people, and they call us the human race
[oh, colored people]
We're colored people, and we all gotta share this space
[yeah we've got to come together somehow]
We're colored people, and we live in a tainted world
[red and yellow, black and white]
We're colored people, every man, woman, boy, and girl
[colored people, colored people, colored people, colored people, yeah]</pre>
