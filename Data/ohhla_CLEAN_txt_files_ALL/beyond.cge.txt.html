[Cage Verse]
Its the worm king
here to teach you strange things
They slammed me on my chest to earth with clipped off wings
so trying to flap squirtin your bitch if she hurtin
my worms crawled in the, and crawled out through venelation
Got 16 hearts all palpitating
Mutate half way to manifestation
I got 5 star ratins on my dick, rappin'
scrappin' your brains with the brush of death
Sent for some fuckin' noises
if no bitch ass accent
militant experiment goin' A-wall
plus your runnin' down the block with your ripped off face ?
Son of Pontius if your mador's feelin' monstrous
my subconscious projects psychedelics mirages under garages
I spit G's like a hoax scientist
slobbin' off the hook with the fuckin' worm bitch
fuckin' worm bitch, fuckin' worm bitch</pre>
