"Yo Banks, give me a funky-ass bass line"

(Mack 10)
Here's a little something, bout a nigga like me
Never shoulda been let out the penatentiory
Mack 10, I'd like to say
That I'm a crazy mothafucka, from around the way
Since I was a youth, I grew weed out
Now I'm the mothafucka that you read about
Selling a ounce or two, that's what the hell I do
You don't like how I'm living, well FUCK YOU!
This is the dope game, and I'm in it
My nigga G, will fuck you up in a minute
With a, right, left, right, left ya toothless
Then you say, GOD DAMN THEY RUTHLESS
Everywhere we go they say "DAMN"
It's the connect game, fucking up the programme
Then they realise we don't care
We don't say no, we to busy saying YEEAH!
About drinking, straight out the odd bottle
Do I look like a mothafucking role model ?
Too a kid looking up to me
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
You fuck with me, I'll put a foot in ya ass
See, I don't give a fuck, cause I keep dealing
Yo, what the fuck are they yelling ?

(Chorus)
GANGSTA GANGSTA
"That's what they yelling" - DR. DRE
"It's not about a salary, it's all about reality" - EAZY-E
GANGSTA GANGSTA
"Yo Mack, say what the fuck you feeling, 
and don't hold a damn thing back"

(Mack 10)
Me and my homeboys stepped in the house
All the punk ass niggaz started breaking out
Cause you know, they know what's up
So we start looking for the bitches with the big butts
Like her, but she keep crying
"I got a boyfriend", Bitch stop lying
Dumb ass hooker, ain't nothing but a dyke
Suddenly I see, some niggaz that I don't like
Walked over to 'em, and said "What's up ?"
The first nigga that I saw, banged 'em in the jaw
Cube starts stomping 'em with W.C.
By that time, got rushed by security
Out the door, but we don't quit
WAIT UP!, "Let's start some shit"
I got a shot-gun, and here's the plot
Taking niggaz out with a flurry of buck shots
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!, yeah I was gunning
Then you looked, and all you see is niggaz running
And falling, and yelling, and pushing and screaming, and cussing
I stepped back, and I kept bussing
Then I realised, it's time for me to go
So I shot, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that HOO-RIDE
The Hoo-Bang niggaz, wanted for a homicide
Cause I'm the type a nigga, that's built to last
You fuck with me, I'll put a foot in ya ass
I don't give a fuck, cause I keep dealing
Yo, what the fuck are they yelling ?

(Chorus) - w/ minor variation in last line

(Mack 10)
Homies all standing around, just hanging
Some dope dealing, some gang-banging
We decide to roll, and we deep
See a nigga on 20's and we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had the .44, pointed in the window
He got scared, and hit the gas
Right then, I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin, I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said FUCK IT!
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweating all the bitches, in the tight-ass shorts
We didn't get no play, from the ladies
With 6 niggaz in the coupe, is you crazy ?
She was scared, and then was sure
We all said "FUCK YOU BITCH", and kept going
To the hood, that we was sent to
Find something else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
A bomb rush, but we call it rat-pack
On a nigga, witta hella surprise
Mack 10 will go stupid, when he full on train-eyes
I might stumble, but still won't loose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
Cause I'm the type a nigga that's built to last
Fuck with me, I'll put a foot in ya ass
See I don't give a fuck, caz I keep dealing
Yo, what the fuck are they yelling ?

(Chorus) w/ minor variation in last line again

(Mack 10)
Here's a little gangsta short in size
With a T-shirt and Levis, as his only disguise
Built like a tank, and hard to hit
Mack 10 and Scoop go running shit
(Scoop)
Well I'm the nigga Scoop, the one they talking about
Nigga tried to roll a dice, and straight cracked out
At least try to roll, it's time to go
I creep away real slow, and jump in the 6-4
With the ???
Digging the scene with the gangstaline
Cause I'm the Scoop, I don't slang or bang
I just smoke mothafuckas like it ain't no thang
And to you bitches, you know I'm talking to you
"We wanna fuck you Scoop!"
I wanna fuck you too
Cause you see, I really don't take no shit
(Mack 10)
So let me tell you mothafuckas who you fucking wit
(Scoop)
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
You fuck with me, I'll put a foot in ya ass
See I don't give a fuck, cause I keep dealing
Yo, what the fuck are they yelling ?

(Chorus) - w/ minor variation in last line again</pre>
