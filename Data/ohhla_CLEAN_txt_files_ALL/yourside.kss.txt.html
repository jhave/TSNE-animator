I'll be by your side (General)
I'll always find a way
I love you too much, to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by

[VERSE 1:]
(By your side)
It makes me strong
It gives me the strength to bang out and make these songs
If I do it on the spot or if it takes me long they can't stop me
Even if my breaks was on
I'm still..
(By your side)
I'm always here, nobody's perfect
Life ain't always fair
I used to not give a fuck
I ain't always care when it's too hot for the hammer
You know the hawk is right..
(By your side)
Until you get to the car
And you gotta get through the D before you get to the R
If I don't get you today then I'ma get you tomorrow
As soon as you come out your crib I'ma be right..
(By your side)
Where I'm supposed to be
Close to you, with the toast close to me
And screw it if it's the right or wrong thing
When you in the sight of that long thing
You wish you had a strong team right..
(By your side)

[CHORUS:]
I love you too much to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
By your side (yeah, yeah)
By your side (let's go)
I love you too much to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
By your side

[VERSE 2:]
As long as you need me
I'm down for whatever hommie as long as you feed me
I pull the big joints out as long as the TV
Or I can play my part and just breathe easy right..
(By your side)
As soon as something happen to you
Your n*****s would bounce and you thought they were scrappin' witcha you
Now you cleanin' your cuts with peroxide
And you wake up in the ER with the Doc right..
(By your side)
Puttin' tubes in you and you can't even eat right
They puttin' food in you
Your body's getting colder
Devil on your shoulder
And you Mom's in the room but you just wanna hold her..
(By your side)
Nothin' but realness
That's why everybody in the world could feel this
I'm on top and ya'll under me
So when it's over; if I ain't in the front, atleast I'm gonna be..
(By your side)

[CHORUS:]
I love you too much to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
By your side (yeah)
By your side (let's go)
I love you too much to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
By your side

[VERSE 3:]
Until they finish me off
If they don't get us both you'll be sending me off
And please just do me this favor
Stick to our little plan
And f*ck the money
Just keep my little man..
(By your side)
And show 'em there's hope
And he gon' think he knows whats going
But show him the ropes
And if you bring him to the Gucci store
Show him the loffs hood n*****s I'm just showing you growth
But I'm still right..
(By your side)
You know Kiss don't gotta aim his gun at you to be focused
And if you broke now n***a when you see those chips
Watch how many people come out of nowhere
And try to be..
(By your side)
The answer's plenty
Cause when you handling business you can't be friendly
And if you tryna stack something
Can't be pennies
Most likely grants and benggies
And you better keep 'em..
(By your side)

[CHORUS:]
I love you too much to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
By your side
By your side
I love you too much to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
By your side
By your side
By your side
By your side</pre>
