[Kool Keith]
There's more whack shit than a lil' bit
Motherfuckin football players tryin to rhyme
Basketball niggaz, fuck the rap game, don't waste your time
Stay off the court, get off the fuckin football field
My rap shit is real, ABC News got you gassed up
Fucked up from the mouth up
Pushin assets, Bentleys and houses
Take off your jerseys, grab the mics
Shut the fuck up, flow for flow
Show for show, bitch go for go
Them everyday motherfuckers you listen to, won't help you
when motherfuckers rippin you, from asscrack to ankles
When I'm dissin you, hold the toilet bowl I'm pissin too
Make your white Persian rugs turn yellow - HELLO!!!!
You fucked up with a commercial-ass nigga, soft as Jello
You motherfuckers head back to gas, somethin more mellow
Shit on your telephones and change your zip code zones
Reptile alien motherfuckers, gorillas comin toward me
I shit on you clones, and defecate twice in your ice cream cones
Let a Mexican tell you
Why did you try to embarass yourself and rap against, Kool Keith homes?
Take your basketballs and stick it up your ASS
Take your footballs and stick it up yo' ASS
I battle 27 teams, all the way to New York for 5 hours first class
Give your whack-ass friends a enema
Your girlfriends witness my shit, with a buddy pass
I concentrate, break down motherfuckers fast
G-string niggaz, cover your ass
Dumb ass bitches be quiet - my boyfriend's all that
He's 245 pounds worth of muscle, he can rap fast
Happy New Year bitch!  Kiss my ASS
You know the kid, I'm Bill BLASS
Fuck around, you got the GAS
All you motherfuckers comin out here for the awards and shit
Fuckin go back home</pre>
