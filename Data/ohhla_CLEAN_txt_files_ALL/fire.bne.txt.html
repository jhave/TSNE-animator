[Hook - Krayzie Bone]
FIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE! Burn, baby, BURN!
Burn, baby, BURN! Burn, baby, BURN! BURN!
Yeah, we got that FIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE! Burn, baby, BURN!
Burn, baby, BURN! Burn, baby, BURN! BURN!

[Bridge - Krayzie Bone &amp; Wish Bone]
[Both] The roof, (the roof), the roof, (the roof), the roof, (the roof)
[Kray] I'll heat ya block with heat so, hot, hot, hot...
[Both] The roof, (the roof), the roof, (the roof), the roof, (the roof)
[Wish] Me squeeze one shot, and leave ya not, not, not...

[Krayzie Bone]
Anywhere you wanna do it, nigga we can get it poppin like a firecracker!
But I'm wild, I get at cha, hit a nigga like a tractor, collapse ya, thrash ya
Rat-a-tat ya, matter of fact ya - dead!
Never comin back here, sendin out last year
Took a look at the competition, there was none there
So a nigga hit the hood, let it rumble in the streets
To let everybody know, we keep heat!
Nigga got that fire, fire baby! Got that fire fire baby!
Got that fire, fire, baby! Got that fire, fire, baby!
Got that fire, fire, baby! Got that fire, fire, baby!
Got that fire, fire, baby! Got that fire, fire, baby, baby, baby...
Try to test me and I bet you get burned!
And at the same time learn, that I'm not that nigga
Nigga on it for reala, you wanna deal with the killa
Give the scrilla to me, really, I get 'em, I get up in 'em!
They betta be able to handle the heat
cause we gon take it to a million degrees!
Somebody betta go and call the fire department
Them Bone niggaz all knock shit on FIRE!

[Chorus - Krayzie Bone]
[Bridge - Krayzie Bone &amp; Wish Bone]

[Layzie Bone]
lil L-Burna finna burn it up, we got 'em runnin to the radio to turn it up!
Like "is it really them thugs?" Yeah nigga this us!
And when we come with the heat, we gon burn ya up!
Finna do damage cause I'm a certified criminal
I know it's illegal, but I'ma leave a nigga critical
Put the gun down, nigga we can get physical
Bullshit, tricked ya - bang! You invisible!
Disappear like the rest of these niggaz that are turnin to ghosts
Cause they can't come close to the original nine-nine
You know where to find mine, I'm strapped with a four-five
I'm posted with that fire, fire, baby! That fire, fire, baby!
That fire, fire, baby! That fire, fire, baby...
I ain't even gotta tell y'all niggaz that the rhythm that I ride to the beat be scorchin!
Like the middle of the summer, tryna sit on the porch, no shade and your body be torchin!
Keep my name out ya mouth with that he say, she say, nigga better peep what we say!
Fuck around and get caught up in the heatwave, y'all nigga better not try to be brave!

[Chorus - Krayzie Bone]
[Bridge - Krayzie Bone &amp; Wish Bone]

[Wish Bone]
Ahhhhh!
Let me tell ya somthin, nigga, if the fire's started
I'm the nigga with the matches, let it flame up!
Scare me, scare whoever shot, before you pull it
better know what you're gon do and who's who
Guaranteed to bring the flames, got that fire
when you're listening, yes that-that fire, fire
You don't like me, so what? Act up, fire gon make ya hate me...
Fuck sick shit up, move up, burn shit down, spark it up!
Then ya lay down.. cause I got that fire, fire, fire baby!
Got that fire, fire, baby! Got that fire, fire, baby!
Got that fire, fire, baby! Got that fire, fire, baby...
And I'm old school, still don't believe me
then ya let it all burn, then there's no clues
Gotta do what its gon do, and that's burn, baby, burn!
No questions, that's juks, snitches talk, thugs get to walkin
Them other niggaz gon get served in the chalk
But not me, no witnesses, thugs, so burn, burn!</pre>
