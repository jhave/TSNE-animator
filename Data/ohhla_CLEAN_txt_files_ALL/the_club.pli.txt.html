[Intro]
This here a message homie to anybody who possibly gon' be in the
club that I'm goin' in tonight homie... You better gon' head &amp; get'cha
shine on before I get to the club dog...

[Chorus]
Let me think tonight, what I'mma do at the club?
Might show up tonight, just to throw dubs
Or I might buy the bar to fuck wit' the scrubs
How I feel tonight shawty I am the club
Let me think tonight, what I'mma do at the club?
Might show up tonight, just to throw dubs
Or I might buy the bar to fuck wit' the scrubs
How I feel tonight shawty I am the club

[Verse 1]
Parked the whip out front jumped out stuntin'
Neck full of jewels whole pocket full of money
All the goons around me so you know I'm comin'
Half a brick in my pocket ten stacks on me
Better let me ball you don't want no problem homie
Last problem in the club somebody start dumpin'
I'm the main attraction y'all peons
Got a dope boy knot on me, no one's
Came through the side do', slid wit' my gun
Somebody daughter gettin' it the question which one
'Gnaced up and on good 'dro, body numb
Let me show you how a real goon have fun

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Y'all in trouble tonight we got the club locked
We ain't dancin' over here all we do is bop
One thang fa sho we got them hammers cocked
Look at all the dimes sweat us, they comin' by the flock
Look at the lil' hater over there, got him hot
Seen him lookin' at me so I held up a knot
I don't know if you know homie I run the spot
And don't 'cha play wit' me, you ain't got enough shots
Order mine straight up, drank it on the rocks
Been in the club five minutes and done closed shop
How can one nigga be this gotdamn hot?
I don't know if it's me it might be the watch

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Slid through the club late all I need is a hour
Like they told me lil' homie money is power
Ran the streets all day I'm fresh out the shower
Watch how a goon rock let me show you my volume
Check my track record homie all I beat is stallions
I done smashed already shit you can have her
If you want her better catch her better gon' snatch her
Want straight animals over here, no hackers
Better put the cuffs on her 'fore the goons pack her
When we leave the club watch you follow after
Y'all ain't groupies baby stop bein' embarrassed
This one here in the book, this a closed chapter

[Chorus]
