[VERSE I]
We hit too many left turns to make it right
My black fist and the peace sign now say goodnite
But Ima stay the fight laser light with you're a.m. like
Here's an order Black be the quarterback take a hike
Hut one, hut two, hut three 
Your family ? calico eighty one to your chest
Randy moss
How much the candy cost?
Then im explainin to folks 
Its terrific but be specific
The ? the coke
I refrain from the hoax
Lame, This game is a joke 
But hit the hotline got mine then ranged to the rove
I move the work from New York to New England
New Hampshire, New London , New Jersey, New Zealand
Hop out like who dealin'? who slingin? 
(Rick?) lookin' like who wheelin? Who blingin? 
Then I handle weed and tell em 
????????
they got the work 
if it don't work 
your money back, guaranteed. 
But I guarantee money with your money you'll be ??
Fuck it up? A disaster B casualties actually
But I move casually 
Not a judge but call me your honorable
Go head and vomit fool, bar none bombable
We beef like a farmer do 
My jewelry is a carnival 
Heard my goddamn chain, its like a ferris wheel 
You fuckin with sosa, you won't find a better deal

[CHORUS]
Willy wack, who you wit 
Get your gat, hit a lick
Flip a pack, flip a brick, man
Louie hat, louie kicks 
Till we strap in the mix
Mooey move back doors 
And we got it for cheap!
Yeah we got it for cheap!
Yeah we got it for cheap!
Man we got it for cheap!
Man we got it for cheap!
Man we got it for cheap
We got it for cheap!
We got it for cheap!

[VERSE II]
I sold guns and the rock 
Filled the ? to the top
40th nigga 
Smoke a blunt with Barack 
Put your heart in your stomach
Your lungs in your socks
Your girl in my bed 
Your son on my block
Yeah, they stole my style
But this the judgement
Welcome to the wild life
"Damn you got a foul wife"
I picked her up from karaoke and pilate class
She like to deepthroat, me I call it lolligag
Y'all niggas call me fags
Not a body cast, a body bag
Fuckers I'll leave his whole body tagged
Primo give me bricks 
I get poppy cash
??/ licks
he'll let the shotty blast
At nine years old yall was watchin ? troops
Me the only fifth grader with the ?? suit
Twenty years later, bitch is ?? gucc shoes
For a months rent, a fly purse, and some new boots
You out the loop lou
Me I'm in the crew coupe
Truck ?? same color as dove soap
Niggas needin' favors
Believe im major
Straight out the hood 
But you should see my neighbors
You say a hundred dollars
He say a piece of paper
Yeah we all own our cars
You still leain' hater?
