Song:   Alphabet Insanity
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I adamantly attack the alphabet
with an anecdotal algorithm made of Adamantium
I'm like an Adderrall-addicted anaconda
or an alcoholic or an asshole like A-Rod, no anabolics
But I brutally and beautifully butcher the banging beat
Brushing bubbly all over your booby and booty beef
'cause I'm a carpenter - I come carving your carcass
Leaving all these carp fish crushed on the carpet
Crumbling chron in Colorado with my Cal cronies
I'm cramming it full of condiments like it's a Calzone
Delicious! I didn't drive and drink
Whether diamonds or dimes, man, I'm diving deep like an electric eel
I'm elegantly eloquent, and every cent
I've ever earned just entered me in the election
I got eleven brains like an enormously educated
Einstein with Elephantitis of the erection
A freak! I'm fighting with a flatfooted felon
Five falcons just flew to a fountain and fell in
Googling googly-eyed girls to get inside
Golly gee from Glasgow to Guatemela's gentrified
A hippopotamus is high on heroin, he heckles me
and hires Haitian Hank to hand his ho a hysterectomy
In hateful hieroglyph I hurl out hyperbolic hubris
and hang with Hipster Helen, that's the hooker with the huge hips
I'm ill. I'm Icarus. I ignite idiots in idioms and issues
Jumpy jargon I joust like Jacare jiving Japanese judo and jiu-jitsu
Killing them like a kid, got a kilogram of ketamine for Kwanzaa
Knit a kimono made out of komodo dragon skin
Rich like a Klingon that be kicking it at the Kremlin
but I'm kicking through your door, call me Kramer Kardashian
Lethal. Literally litter a little limerick that be littler than a Leprechaun
A menace that'll manifest the melancholy mayhem
making a metamorphosis until I'm mechanized like Megatron
Nick Nolte, a nerdy native of Nebraska, needs a neon ninja and a nectarine from NASA
Ominously, I mean it's obvious you see a orthodontist oozing out oodles of onomatopoeias
Oswalt Patton picking a pocket, plucking a patent
I pickle purple poop in Patron for pure passion
I got a question, got to quiz ya:
Let's step on the gas and go quicker. Uh
Really getting ready for the revolution
Reeled a rotten rhythm ring around the Russian Ronda Rousey resort
Serve a simple sentiment, a simile that's smoking like a sheet of Sudafed
I'm swiftly swimming like a seahorse
Titties on Atilla tell a teller that'll toe-tag
Terminator gun inside a turtle-tattered totebag
Thugs are unamerican, unattractive and unwanted as an ugly pair og UGGs
Vivid and vivaviously venomous with the wicked wombats only walking where women is
Getting xenophobic at the Xanadu
XOXO, yippee-ki-yay
Yours truly, Mac
Yes, yo!
Oh, shit, I forgot Z... Zebra</pre>
