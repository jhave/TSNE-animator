Love is pain left out in the rain
With nothing to gain but teardrop stains
Being haunted by a memory as I think back
The things we used to do and how we used to act
With love and trust, passion and plussed
Because a pride never kept things inside yo they was always discussed
Between us, never argued about
And I never gave a clue for you to figure it out
How I miss being blessed with your sweet finesse
As we kiss and twist and caress on the mattress
Sweet body heat, your heartbeat
I'll grip your hips and both of our lips will meet so neat
Staring up at the moonlight with someone to hold tight
Given a chance for romance until the sunlight
Brightens the sky, it reflects in your eye
But now, the reflection is gone and I cry out

<break>
She loves me, she loves me not
Yo she loves me (x2)

Looking at your picture as it sits on the table
As I put on my cable I wish that I was able
To touch but it's a shame that you had to go
So I watch the hands on the clock go real slow
Gone with the wind, is love a sin?
If it is then God, then bring it back again
Not a girl that you rate as a fine blind date
I need a love mate so I can create
So I open a window to feel the wind blow
Try to figure out how can a love end so
Fast and just pass and not even last
First grow like grass, then shatter like glass
Now I stare at the walls, clock five Tylenols
Unplug the telephone to avoid phone calls
As I sit and crave for the love she gave
But when I wake up, I'm the same love slave
Saying

<break>
She loves me, she loves me not
Yo she loves me (x4)

When you lost a good friend, dreams seem to end
Cause broken hearts and men don't blend
So I'm not here to stick every chick I can pick
You move too quick, you become seasick
And a one-night stand is for the one-track mind man
The kind of guy you kick like a can
So I race in space and try to replace the pretty face
But it's a waste, this chase is a kiddy case
Now I whisper how much I missed her
My lips should have blistered the way I kissed her
So soft and slow, laid back and relaxed
And when I move, the groove is as smooth as a sax
She kissed me low and then proceeded up
Bedsheets heated up, the pace is speeded up
Slowly but surely we reach our destiny
She got the best of me and left the rest of me
Now all I got is total confusion
She disappeared and it's not an illusion
My life is bitter, the memories glitter
I feel like dirt, so please do not litter
My heart's deflated, doctors can't rate it
I don't know how the hell I made it
So farewell sweetheart wherever you are
I'll just look at a star, and say yo

<break>
She loves me, she loves me not
Yo she loves me (x4)
