Song:   After the Music Stops
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Lecrae]
Yeah
I got a question
after the show
after the set
after the music stops
what's next? Are we just writing songs
or are we concerned with uniting a people
to follow the great commission of Christ?
Yeah let's get it
let's go...

Back in the day I was a lunch line rapper
after that I guess I was a punch line rapper
then I got saved and sometime after
ya boy came back as a frontline rapper
and when I say the frontlines
that's not a frontline
I'm out here preachin Christ on the frontlines
and no it ain't about rockin stages
cause some of my engagements are out on the pavements yeah
I'm out to take the bible
create disciples
who make disciples
disciple-cycles
that's why I want the beats to knock
so after the music stops you can meet the rock I pray
That you would know him well, this is like show and tell
It's more than a show, I'm showing you Emmanuel
So yeah I'm hopin that you're likin the flow
but it's only so you could know that God I'm writing it for
let's go...

[Chorus]
After the show, after the set
After the music stops what's next?
Will there be fellowship, prayer, disciples?
Will you open your bibles after the music stops?
After it's over, after it ends
After the music stops, what then?
Will you understand that Christ is King?
Or will you just like the words we sing after the music stops

[Lecrae]
I recorded a couple songs some fast some slow
so the listeners would know the importance of the show
the importance of the show's
not to excite these folks but make God's truth relevant
ignite these folks
Discipleship is our call but we make disciples
this is not a suggestion, create disciples
The teachin is a process
it's not over night and it's not a stage and a mic nah
it's life on life Christ -
Walked with twelve
ate with twelve
talked with twelve
shaped the twelve
invested in 'em well you could say that he made the twelve. Who made many more
who made plenty more
now it's on you and me if there's anymore
1 teach, 2 teach, 3 teach, 4 teach
5 teach, 6 teach, 7 teach more
this is what we've been commissioned
it's the reason why I write
so that you could hear the truth
not so you can say I'm tight whoa...

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
So
we write this for the right the speaker was righteous
and then we might check for a culture who likes the hypeness
Some say we keep it crunk, some say we hype man
We just wanna pump the resurrection of the Christ man
We in the -burbs and the hoods that's hostile
we share a common view like synoptic Gospels
and you know we keep a couple young dudes around us
and teach 'em the same truth God used to ground us
This is a lifestyle so, when the mic's down
I pray people follow Christ when they turn the lights down
I pray that everybody playin this song
will be challenged by everything I had to say in this song
I don't do this for the money
I don't do this for fame
I don't do this so the industry can know my name
I do this and host to glorify Yeshua the King
if you're feelin me you know you should be doin the same let's go...

[Chorus]</pre>
