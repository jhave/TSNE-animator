Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Beyotch! Bitch! Hoe bitch!

[Artifacts]
What goes on? 
What goes on baby what goes on? (7X)

[El Da Sensai]
What goes on girl, you riff and you riff about
brothers callin you a bitch, but tell me would you switch
into shame, how one dame, can make a name for all
I guess it's like that when all the chips fall
It's critical stereotypical how they diss you
It ain't you that chill cause you know your status is true
Girls be trickin, on a mission listen what's it for?
All you get is people dissin callin you a whore
But I guess you don't stress it cause you just keep goin
Hoein and hoein thinkin you're sinkin kids for dough and
at the same time you whine how we call you this
or that, it beez that way, givin me no play
Kickin facts and all that, diss em about the schisms
who riff, when brothers call em hoe or a bitch
And if you think we're wrong, give me a gong, word is bond
And all I gotta ask is what goes on?

[Artifacts]
What goes on baby what goes on? (4X)

[Tame One]
I call em as I see em
Steamin on the scheamin as I kick this
fitness with the quickness bout the gutter snipe type bitches
Flippin like switches and don't be knowin niggaz pedigree
You better be ready, I like +Sleepin With the Enemy+
My remedy is any G, fuck em and flee
I shoot the breeze at the skeeze, just because +The P is Free+
Don't try to play me baby yo, you must be crazy
tryin to fade me with no clippers when I know you got some other niggaz
Just keep it real, word is bond we'll get along fine
I know that you're on mine, I peeped it for a long time
High saditty bitties, that's out for the price tag
? get bagged, and be the victim of a right jab
So if you walk like a bitch, talk like a bitch, it's on
But what goes on?

[Artifacts]
What goes on baby what goes on? (4X)

[El Da Sensai]
You in a relationship?  Aight, well cool, we can do this
We start with a kiss and go right down the list
Analyze this, check it how we always spend time
Hittin all spots, bend it up every time
I give you what you want, even more if you ask
Just a small task, any spell you cast
But on the down low, you're hittin that bro, doin the same thing
Skeezin, but what's the reason for the treason?
That's why you're left all alone and you say we're wrong
Sing the song along, tell me what goes on?

[Girl]
This shit here, this is bullshit (hold up hold up hold up)
This is notty for a girl got gats too (I'm sayin)
All you hear now is bitch this bitch that
(cause y'all be actin like that)
What the fuck is goin on? (the fuck you want from me? yo)

[Tame One]
Don't catch offense when the gents call you names
If you ain't one, don't sweat it hon, it's just one of them thangs
in my slang, unless you catch a fit from hearin bitch
If the shoe fits, then wear it, I'm not dissin for the ?, get it
Not every girl's a bitch, yeah that's true
Like my Ma Dukes, but oh yes, the rest I seem to talk to
are shady and not really the ladies they claim to be
It's crazy, everywhere I go, it seems the same to me
That's up until I'm gone
But on the way home I'm still thinkin, what goes on?
