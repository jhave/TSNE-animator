Song:   No More Sorrow
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Are you lost
In your lies
Do you tell yourself I don't realize

Your crusade's a disguise
Replace freedom with fear
You trade money for lives

I'm aware of what you've done

[Chorus]
No, No more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

I see pain
I see need
I see liars and thieves
Abuse power with greed

I had hope
I believed
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived

You will pay for what you've done

[Chorus]

Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites

[Chorus x2]

Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be erased</pre>
