Never mess with those bustas 
Only role with those hustlers 
Never mess with no bustas 

B-Legit: 
Addyup(?) cuz' they done fucked 
Wit a nigga tryin' to get a buck 
I leave 'em stuck posted up at a stand still 
Beat the case off of Dan Vill (?) 
Now I'm back for the overkill, hundred dollar bills 
Stuffed in the duffel bag (duffel bag) 
5 pounds in the back of the deuce rag 
So Harm could ya, would ya help the big fella' 
Tell 'em how you about that scrilla 

Harm: 
It goes down like Brandy 
Peruvian, mother of pearl, caucasion white bitch 
Dirty white girl, uncut raw like Eddy 
Sharp like a 'chete 
Steady on the program 
With missions to get fetti 
And I'm ready 
On the pedal heavy when I smash 
The same muthafucka that hit the gas and dash 
To the other side on the down low 
'Cuz I only deal with hustlers not bustas you know 

Only mess with those hustlers 
Never mess with those bustas 
Only role with those hustlers 
Never mess with no bustas 

B-Legit: 
And not too many get to ride with me 
And you know how a punk ass bitch can be 
A snitch to me 
Heart pump on hundred 
And probably ain't neva' gonna' have no money 

Harm: 
I know the same situations 
But know the vocations to a brother that's lack 
No muscles in your crack 
What happened to all the days that you spent hustlin' 
Now everytime I see ya' you be strugglin' 

B-Legit: 
The batch betta have my cav 
And keep the shit comin like the little big rabbit 
Dag nabbit 
I gotta have it to support 
Can't come up short 
So I'm still selling with the super sport 

Harm: 
I'm still independent 
But in a minute I'ma be laughing 
I got it straight from B-Legit 
Told me, Harm you can have this 
So I had to get to focus 
Left fools all wet 
No jokin' in this game that I play 
And representin' with hustlers eryday 

Only mess with those hustlers 
Never mess with those bustas 
Only role with those hustlers 
Never mess with no bustas 

Harm: 
A funkin we goin' go 
In a carpice fo' door 
Ready for war 
Suspects get took 
Playin' the wrong crooks 
Legit, Harm wit firearm 
And you quiet like storm 

B-Legit: 
In-fra-red 
Niggaz fled from the street side 
From a nigga droppin' mess in a fleet side 
Niggaz ride to blast wit no mass in the broad daylight 
See I neva fuck with bustas at night 

Harm: 
Game tight 
'Cuz the game be thick 
Gotta watch out who ya fuk wit 
'Cuz bustas die quick 
So Legezee 
Would you let ya' playa pezee knezee 
How it goes dezee in the tezee 

B-Legit: 
For shezee 
The savage moves chickens like a Mexican 
And I'm back to writin' bad ass checks again 
Well check yo' chin 
Bitch believe that 
Stays nathin' but game so receive that 

(X2) 
Only mess with those hustlers 
Never mess with those bustas 
Only role with those hustlers 
Never mess with no bustas 

Harm: (X4)
