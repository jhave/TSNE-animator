Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Hood morning
Hood morning
Hood morning
Hood morning

[Verse 1]
No motherfuckin' typo
That's like Westside, Compton with no psychos
That's like Beverly Hills with no lipo
Fuck around and jack some five, no Michael
Hello, a hundred thousand in the mattresses
I'm Hollywood, yeah, I only fuck actresses
I'm in Cannes, France
You don't know where that shit is
SLR, that's where the ratchet is
I'm in the Amber Rose rolls with Amber Rose hoes
Sorry Wiz, that's how the rap shit, it is
You can take it as a shot or free promo
But everybody in this motherfucker know I'm loco
Anne Rogers [?], knock the man off your polo
Used to scare the shit out you niggaz with my old flow
Post-documentary, Comptons most wanted
I'll finish you off like this Corona while I'm yawning
I'll finish you off like this Corona while I'm yawning
And roll up that OG kush, like motherfucker

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Me and Skee been doing this
Y'all had Snoop
I'll put the Piru in this
Look at all these fake ass bloods trying to ruin it
Everything red down to the 'Ye Louis kicks
And who is this?
With the all red crucifix
Navy blue Cardinal fitted, I'm a lunatic
Flow like the uzi spit
Hoppin' out the newest shit, windows down
Disturbin' the peace!
Bitch, I'm Ludacris
Used to be on the block moving rocks from 2 to 6
Jimmy Iovine money, feeding on some Jewish shit
Whips transform
Shia Lebouf my newest shit
Caramelo yellow Camaro 22's
And If a nigga run up
I'm a fuck dem up
I sung your new rap niggaz, [?]

[Break]
West coast niggaz got crazy game
When you get off the plane
Better guard your chain
Man fuck this shit
Mars tell these motherfuckers

[Chorus]</pre>
