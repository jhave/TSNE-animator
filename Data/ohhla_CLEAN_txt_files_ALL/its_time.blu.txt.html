[Blue Raspberry]
It's time to relax your mind

It's twelve in the afternoon
Sunrays beamin through my room
Makin me so hot
The temperature's a hundred and two (one hundred and two)
Tell me what can I do
The whole week has been hectic
I gotta find somethin to do
I think I wanna get lifted

[Hook: Blue Raspberry]
I've had so much stress on me
I feel like I need to get away
Even for a day
Gonna call my friends up and let them know
From late tonight to the break of dawn
There's a party goin on

[Chorus: Blue Raspberry]
(It's time) It is time
(Relax your mind) Relax your mind
(It's time)
(Relax your mind)
Get your forties and your blunts
Roll em anywhere you want
Let's get a session goin on so we can get on up

[Blue Raspberry]
Now that I got you here everything is fine
Maxin and just relaxin, sippin on some red wine
I'm happy to see everyone
Ooooh, havin a good time
Don't let anything worry you
Just leave your troubles behind

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Blue Raspberry]
Everything's fine
To the millions won't you come and swing
To Shaolin won't you come and swing
To the West Coast won't you come and swing
Everybody come and swing
To the East Coast come and swing

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Blue Raspberry]
Get your forties and blunts
(It's time)
Get your forties and blunts (Relax your mind)
(It's time)
(Relax your mind)
Get your forties and your blunts
Roll em anywhere you want
Let's get a session goin on so we can get on up
(It's time)
(Relax your mind)
(It's time) It's time, it's time
(Relax your mind)
Get your forties and your blunts
Roll em anywhere you want
Let's get a session goin on so we can get on up

It's time, it's time to relax your mind
Come and swing
There's a party goin on
I have so much stress on me, so much stress on me
Get your forties and your blunts
Roll em anywhere you want
Let's get a session goin on so we can get on up
It's time, it's time
Get your forties and your blunts
Roll em anywhere you want
Let's get a session goin on so we can get on up</pre>
