[Chorus: Slim Thug (Pusha)]
Man, I showed up. Pimpin ya cold up
I head straight to the bar just to post up
I roll the dro up, my cup mold up
Bitch don't just stand there wit ya nose up
C'mon WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)
Ha! WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)
WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)
Ha! WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)

[Pusha T]
No hotta, flow droppa since Papa
You Penny Annie niggaz, see I know Copper
Left the game on a high note, flow opera
Pusha still got them KIs I can unlock ya
See that watch on the sleeve? Call it show stoppa
Nigga ball around the world, call me +Globe Trotter+
Trick dollar, ask what I feel? Notta
Give a bitch yellow fever all these gold bottles
And late models, I lean throttles
Roof back with the coupe black, playa think he need goggles
Look mama, I be fly papa
Strictly Bathing Ape, Ice Cream and BBC rocker, EGHCK!
So proper, hammer time, gun cocker
Top shotta, me hesitate none, pop ya
Egg shell on the scale for my snow coppers
Don't ask what I sell, shit I'm Bet Crocker

[Chorus: Slim Thug (Pusha)]
Man, I showed up. Pimpin ya cold up
I head straight to the bar just to post up
I roll the dro up, my cup mold up
Bitch don't just stand there wit ya nose up
C'mon WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)
Ha! WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)
WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)
Ha! WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)

[Malice]
Mirror mirror, who's the fairest?
Tricked a buck fifty on that horse and carriage
Must admit, nothing like these carats
Them hoes holla back just like they parrots
Down to the watches, alligator strap
Six different time zones, I don't set her back
17 a brick, yeah, go and tell 'em that
I got the wamp wamp when I move it its still damp
Mildew-ish when I heat it, it turn bluish
It cools to a tight wad, the Pyrex is Jewish
I get paper, it seems I get foolish
Take it to Jacob and play "Which hues the bluest?"
We ain't browsing, luxurious housing
Pull up so mean with the Angel bowing
Or with the emblem bearing the stallion
European custom, the leathers Italian

[Chorus: Slim Thug (Pusha)]
Man, I showed up. Pimpin ya cold up
I head straight to the bar just to post up
I roll the dro up, my cup mold up
Bitch don't just stand there wit ya nose up
C'mon WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)
Ha! WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)
WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)
Ha! WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)

[Pusha T]
EGHCK! So much glamour, that I can't stand the
Bright from the ice, chain xenon lamp ya
Depression in ya mind like a free frame camera
The white tape tight like ya seen on pampers
What's under the couch? Probably freeze up Santa
What ever it cost baby we got answers
Line outside full of Jo-Jo Dancers
"We Got it for Cheap" that's the Re-Up anthem

[Malice]
By far the coldest, '06 Lotus
0 to 60, hocus pocus
The feds don't know so they stick they noses
While we off the coast, proposing toasts
Hoes and mo shit, the family close knit
And deep like the Hutu, you cockroaches
Just like the flow, the fo's ferocious
I tuck you in. homie. "Buenos noches"

[Chorus: Slim Thug (Pusha)]
Man, I showed up. Pimpin ya cold up
I head straight to the bar just to post up
I roll the dro up, my cup mold up
Bitch don't just stand there wit ya nose up
C'mon WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)
Ha! WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)
WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)
Ha! WAMP! WAMP! What it do? (What it do?)</pre>
