[Chorus]
Nuclear power, you can feel how we're changing up the game
Things won't be the same
After we're done with it
We're hollering at you all like "come get it"
Guys say (bum bum bum, bum bum bum)
All the girls say (bum bum bum, bum bum bum)
 
When the roof comes tumbling down
You know we're the cause of that
I'mma go down in history as some kind of, alien rhymer
Who blew up the planet and left in a space liner
And took all the bitches with him and then hit them
My man Nucleus provided this dumb rhythm--
Dumb meaning good; not dumb meaning stupid
Ya'll don't believe, but you can come see my do it
I troop with my troopers, that's all there is to it
I say what the fuck I feel, get used to it
Ah! It's an incredible game
I got love for my partners, we're never the same
And ooh! Sometimes I'm wildin' out
Set the building on fire then you filing out
And then we can turn it into a block party
Get your drinks on while you call the cops on me
 
Chorus
 
[Prevail]
I keep a ton of them running like mascara
Prev One number one in the last era
Now that's terror, you should call me the Crypt Keeper
Smoke a green reefer with the Grim Reaper
The kind of rapper you should keep in your household
Turn up the heat because everything in my mouth cold
I'm a baller, vice and rock
Hurling words at a speed that's unorthodox
Clashing worlds, Pandora's Box
Burning herb, twenty past four o'clock
Shove my cellmates loose, all hell breaks loose
Hit you from above and put some shelves on your roof
Calling the move, run through obstacles
Retrospect, laser optical
Seven nation's armies couldn't hold me back
When I sling a battle axe, I'mma make a skull crack
 
[Mad Child]
Ain't no holding us back like crack addicts
Tell your whole camp to pack up: I'm back at it
As a matter of fact I'm strapped with raps
So combat, full contact (you don't want that)
Put you in a headlock, twist your arm back
Rip up your dough bag (snatch your chains)
Got a lot of great friends but I act (so strange)
I wonder if it's anything to do with the fame
I wonder how many of them would like to ruin my name
Careful what you wish for, might come true
Then every move you make, they're like "can I come too?"
And everyone you meet is like "how can I join you?"
I ain't pretending and it's not strenuous
My girlfriend's jealous and my best friend's envious
Stay focused, please remember this:
Keep friends close, but with enemies I'm friendliest
