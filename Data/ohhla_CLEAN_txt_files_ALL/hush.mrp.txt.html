[Master P]
Oh, y'all think it's a game, huh?
Take one of mine and don't think I'm a take one of yours
Huh, might take three or four of yours
Lights out

[Chorus]
Put the bullets in the ninety, Nigga hush hush
Now if you wanna see yo people, Nigga hush hush
See we don't give a FUCK, so Nigga hush hush
Until it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust...

Put the bullets in the ninety, Nigga hush hush
Now if you wanna see yo people, Nigga hush hush
See we don't give a FUCK, so Nigga hush hush
Until it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust...

[Master P]
Now I done pissed on some graves and put some gats in some mouths
I done ran through the hood and made the rats come out
Now y'all think it's a fuckin game
These niggaz know why I came
I'm bout to knock on his door 
And bust this bitch brains
This nigga done stole somethin from me 
That I could never get back
See I remember the days me and my soldiers dressed in all black
Now if it's twenty five to life, I might do myself
Cuz I was a ghetto nigga, and some bad cards was delt
No milk from the bottle, momma had beer in her tittys
Now the more I smoke weed, I think these niggaz wanna get me
And I'm paranoid, for all the souls got taught
But should I sit down like a bitch, or revenge what I lost
{*gun shot*}

[Chorus]
Put the bullets in the ninety, Nigga hush hush
Now if you wanna see yo people, Nigga hush hush
See we don't give a FUCK, so Nigga hush hush
Until it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust...

Put the bullets in the ninety, Nigga hush hush
Now if you wanna see yo people, Nigga hush hush
See we don't give a FUCK, so Nigga hush hush
Until it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust...

[Krazy]
Get your people on the floor, I need fifty G's
Tell your mother fuckin daugher that she better not breathe
I'm full of greed, til' I get this fuckin paper out ya'
And I bet you tommorow they gone read about ya'
Three bodys found burned, with they tongue n head missing
When I cut ya' daughters throat, her body start pissin'
??? hit ya, I don't know why I just smoked your ass
but nigga called me on the phone, and said he had the cash
Oh shit, I told him meet me at the park
A black suit, some Jason masks after dark
Nigga didn't bring the cops, so I guess he was stuck
Hit him fifty fuckin times, and I told him shhh...

[Chorus]
Put the bullets in the ninety, Nigga hush hush
Now if you wanna see yo people, Nigga hush hush
See we don't give a FUCK, so Nigga hush hush
Until it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust...

Put the bullets in the ninety, Nigga hush hush
Now if you wanna see yo people, Nigga hush hush
See we don't give a FUCK, so Nigga hush hush
Until it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust...

[Slay Sean]
Assed out, no where to go with the gats out
Stashed out, ready and willing to mash out
Hit the crack house
Two in the spot, back out
One in the leg
Two in the head, Blacked out
Nigga layin' there bleedin' just pointin' the stash out 
Stalling on me, hurry up pull them stacks out
Times runnin' out, sooner or later you assed out
Times up nigga, shhh.... LIGHTS OUT

[Chorus]
Put the bullets in the ninety, Nigga hush hush
Now if you wanna see yo people, Nigga hush hush
See we don't give a FUCK, so Nigga hush hush
Until it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust...

Put the bullets in the ninety, Nigga hush hush
Now if you wanna see yo people, Nigga hush hush
See we don't give a FUCK, so Nigga hush hush
Until it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust...

[Master P]
Yea'... Y'all cowards out there, Hush
All Y'all real niggas out there, Hush
Do what you gotta do nigga, then Hush
HAHA, some mo' motherfuckin' fairy tales from Ghetto Postage nigga
With the motherfuckin' stamps on it, ya heard me?</pre>
