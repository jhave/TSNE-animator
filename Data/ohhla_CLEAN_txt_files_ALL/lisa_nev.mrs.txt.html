{*shocked*} Don't get no attitude with me! Why you rasing your voice?
Use your inside voice when you talk to me, don't do that
(...Anyway!)

I just wanna get you mad so you can get Easty, that's all
I just wanted to bring the Crenshaw High out in you
(I'm never Easty) You're NEVER Easty
Why you deny your heritage and your Crenshaw roots?
You shouldn't, you shouldn't you shouldn't be ashamed of that
That's all, that's...That's why you're so special to me
