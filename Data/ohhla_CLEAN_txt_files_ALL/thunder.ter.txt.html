[Intro - Prospect Park]
Yeah
What up man, this yo boy Prospect right here man
T-Squad BX you know what it is man
It's been a long time man
Y'all niggaz think this shit is easy
Niggaz struggle for this shit right here man
Listen to this man

[Prospect Park]
Aye yo, they got me poisoned like ivy
Y'all been waiting for them boys to come try me
Quick on the draw, fast on the finger like Mike Lowrey
Niggaz funny, first they get your numbers
Then want to shout you
See you getting money
now they want the guns to come out you
Well you see we all be having dreams about them cars and floors
With some of ? ? marry you, the call is yours
I was determined
My niggaz out will burn and chew you
Spit you out, like a shot from a German luger
Now who want it, test my peoples I'll blast the boy
Pull out them twin desert eagles, like I'm Pastor Troy
Man I've been through some rough winters
And plush like four summers
But I've made it over them rough roads like old hummers
Look I'm a, made man crook
Now see me in ?
But I'mma go this way and write rhymes in your Shakespeare book
Niggaz be scared to death, I can see in the face they shook
And they ain't want give me a shot, I had to make them look
It's Prosp'

[Chorus]
(It's the upcoming success. Definition Of Prospect)
Yo mom, your baby boy the king of men
(It's the upcoming success. Definition Of Prospect)
I ride or die with them guns in my hands
(It's the upcoming success. Definition Of Prospect)
I move with no fear, the BX up in here
(It's the upcoming success. Definition Of Prospect)
And though I'm storming, there's thunder in the air

[Prospect Park]
Aye yo, they say the ? for this music I was cutting my classes
Stood up late night, a stanky nigga bustin my ass
Now my memory cake, and y'all niggaz cake is telling ain't me shitty
Y'all stressing misdemeanors, man I catch a felony quickly
Shit I deserved what I got
And yo them forms they be copyin
You tried to swerve in my spot
Go earn a war on your block
I just came to lay my name down, I work a hard shift
Show my talents to the world and expose my god gift
I was grown with hard end, many obstacles and fights
But I learned to heal my scars, like them doctors doing life
Keep it moving, cruising
Doing like a hundred and sixty
And I ain't stopping till them motherfucking cops come and get me
I survived my community
Took my opportunity
To get money and y'all mad cause I'm doing me (cut it out man)
I'm going south and I'm fishing
Stop that mouthing and bitching
Put your money on the table, I'll put you out of commission

[Chorus]

[Prospect Park]
Big Pun whattup
My lil Brother Dee yeah
Uh huh</pre>
