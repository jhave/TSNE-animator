[Intro: Cappadonna]
It's always a struggle, yeah
Don't care how you look at
P.J.'s, you know how it get, dirty, dirty
Straight up and down, whole Staten Island (uh-huh)
Slums, still the same, dude... word

[Cappadonna]
From Park Hill to Jungle Nil', we fight like Navy SEAL
Don't get killed, chicks can't run in them heals
Niggas whippin' out guns, payin' them bills
Life is a bitch, you best not snitch
Muthafucka, this the real, always
The dope fiends, the crack stashed in the hallways
Style hold it down, tell Polite call Kane
Don't never test this, we try'nna make all aids
Just niggas down when we blaze, crime pays
Survival in the P.J.'s, or graffiti experts, M.C.'s and the D.J.'s
Better watch your back when flippin' them pies
Real niggas be goin' down right in front of your eyes
If you on the block gettin' it, or a straight nine to five
Still real, Homicide Hill, police circlin'
NARCs got pictures of your grill, street turbulance

[Chorus: Cappadonna]
Cuz everytime I close my eyes, I could feel the rain
And everywhere I seem to go girl, can't stop the pain
No... can't stop the pain, no..

[Cappadonna]
Uh... this one's for mamma
Niggas be gettin' slumped in my projects, it's real violent
Crackheads be on the steps, young bloods'll pop somethin'
Just to get that rep, everyday it's like this
Don't even come outside, if you ain't try'nna get no rich
Niggas murk each other for a small amount of chips
Bloods fightin' other Bloods, there's no Crips where I live
Somethin' gotta give, niggas bust one another
Turn around and watch other kids, my hood's straight 7:30'in
It get buckwild and the blocks is still dirty
Cameras in the hall, bulletholes left in the wall
Laundromats locked up, floods in the building
The front drain is stopped up, I've been in the hood
Ever since my pain popped up, but just in case
One of ya'll niggas forgot, look at your head nigga
What's that little red dot? Got ya!

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Cappadonna]
Give me the bread, heavy on the cheese
Uh... straight like that
Population Click! What's the deal
FMF, PGL, Osama Island
All my niggas in Crimestock, Sing-Sing, what's the deal?
Far Rock' posse, Queens, Brooklyn, P-Lon
That's my word... dance with this!
Get your guns together... takin' pictures..</pre>
