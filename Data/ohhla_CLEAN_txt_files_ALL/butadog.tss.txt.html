Song:   I Ain't Nothin But a Dog
Typed by: OHHLA.com

I've been a dog ever since I was young
I saw The Mack and got all so sprung
I couldn't help it, I had to be just like that
With a stable of hoes and my pockets fat
But don't trip, I made up my mind when I was 17
I ain't with no marriage and a wedding ring
I be a player for life, forget about a wife 
She just ain't my type 
Cause i mack each hoe and get richer
And if it ain't like that then I forget ya
I know you're just a freak, hoe 
You're so nasty
That's why you're stairin' 
When you walk like pass me
Bitch, now you're lookin' back
All dogs must chase the cat 
So here I come, I just wanna fuck you and cut 
Treat you like trampy slut
So much game when homies' tough
Meet a bitch like you and smooth come up
I have your fake-ass closin' up bank accounts
Spittin' straight pimpgame from the Oakland-town
It's been done before and i do it again
Break your mama, your sista and all your friends
$hort dog's on the microphone
And I won't stop mackin' till my bank is long
So try to break me if you wanna
From me you get nothin' but drama
If you're a rich bitch, I got a new twist
And if you're with it, bitch
Then we can do this
Put me on the payroll 
Bick me down bankroll
Buy me a benz and keep my tank full
Cause other than that, I don't need no brood
$hort Dog ain't nothin' but a dog...

I got all my game from East Oakland's street
So mothafuck you damn shit-head freaks
Couldn't pay me enough to treat you right
Cause $hort Dog ain't nothin' nice
Like a sucka-mothafucka let a bitch be boss
Tellin' him how much she wants 
Let her use your car
I'm from oakland, bitch
And you can check my rap
I hear fake bitches get slapped
Let a bitch get bold with me 
I start to act like Goldy
Tell me who's in the house now? 
Shorty The Pimp
And I'm the last mothafucka 
That will pay your rent
I ain't blind, I know you're fine as fuck
But you're a tramp, bitch
You ain't mine what's up?
Try to give me some pussy but I want some head
And I allready know everythin' you did
They say you fuck like old-ass tired bitch
But the word is out you suck some good ass dick
And I don't want nothin' if I can't get it all
You should know 
Cause I ain't nothin' but a dog, bitch...

$hort dog ain't nothin' but a dog
Bitch, fuck with me and you gotta do it all
Most brothas try to take freaks out
I get a room and stick my dick in her mouth
They spend money on a movie and some dinner
But $hort Dog goes straight up in her
I give bitches no respect
And the way I run my game they understand this shit
You couldn't be like me cause you buy her things
Used to be a broke fiend and now it's diamond rings
I remember when I fucked your prom date
You bought a dress and everythin' 
But she just couldn't wait for the pralm to end
So she can call me up it was our very first date 
And it was cool to fuck
Now I be doin' this shit all the time
I got bitches on my mind
Can't change in 1992
Cause I still gotta find new, sweet, black
What should I call it? I won't say it 
But if it's lain' on my bed, I'm a fade it
$hort dog ain't nothin' but a dog
Use to clown to hoes at the East Maid mall
I was actin' like a pimp when I was 7
Started to suckin' up game at 11
And at the age of young 14
I started to knock young bitches on the scene
Couldn't give a fuck less about a bitch
Thinkin' like that $hort Dog got rich
Now I'm makin' ends and you think i'm weak
Cause i'm allways downin'  these toe-up freaks
Tell me who's the man
And who's the mouse, bitch?
I'm Audi-five to my dog house...
