Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I was never nothing popular and neither was she
She was kind though, always had a smile for me
I never thought much about her, didn't see her that way
And she was always out sick, missing every other day
Now that I think about it we was always saying "Hello"
I always figured cuz we both were people alone
I hardly knew her at all, she sat behind me in some classes
What was really going on behind her glasses?
And why was...

Vera Lee
Haunting me, here with me
Vera Lee
Watching me carefully
Vera Lee
Haunting me, here with me
Vera Lee
Watching me carefully
Vera Lee
Haunting me, here with me
Vera Lee
Watching me carefully
Vera Lee
Haunting me, here with me
Vera Lee
Watching me carefully

When I heard she passed away, I must admit I was sad
Cuz of all the mean faces, hers was sweet and always glad
I hardly knew her for nothing, I only knew she was cool
A quiet soul, fragile, slipping through the hallways at school
And now that she's gone, I can hear her crying my name
Although it doesn't make sense to think about, it's insane
But what if I was something special to her cuz I said "Hi"
What if she would always dream about if I was her guy
And what if those "Hello"s that we shared went a long way
What if she felt for me, like, in a strong way
What if she was ill but always tried to make it in
Just to see me in the halls and share our "Hello"s again
Why was...

Vera Lee
Haunting me, here with me
Vera Lee
Watching me carefully
Vera Lee
Haunting me, here with me
Vera Lee
Watching me carefully
Vera Lee
Haunting me, here with me
Vera Lee
Watching me carefully
Vera Lee
Haunting me, here with me
Vera Lee
Watching me carefully

Why!?
Is she calling down to me!?
To me!?
Why!?
Is she calling out to me!?
To me!?

She was pale, and looked so ill and so frail
Maybe she looked at my life, and how it's so stale
And thought "We're both outcasts, maybe we could have each other?"
It flew right over my head, I never even bothered
Now it's too late, and every night I hear her in my head
Begging me to join her with the dead, meh
To think about it's so strange, I hear her singing my name
Vera Lee is haunting my brain! I hear her in the rain!

Vera Lee
Haunting me, here with me
Vera Lee
Watching me carefully
Vera Lee
Haunting me, here with me
Vera Lee
Watching me carefully
Vera Lee
Haunting me, here with me
Vera Lee
Watching me carefully
Vera Lee
Haunting me, here with me
Vera Lee
Watching me carefully

Why!?
Is she calling out to me!?
To me!?
Why!?
Is she calling out to me!?
To me!?
Why!?
Is she calling out to me!?
To me!?
Why!?
Is she calling out to me!?
To me!?
Why!?
Tell me, why is she calling down to me!?
To me!?
Why!?
Why!?
Why!?</pre>
