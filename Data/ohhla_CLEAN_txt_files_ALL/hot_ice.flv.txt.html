[Flavor Flav]
I'm hotter than ice for ya baby
And I hope our love never ends
Without you my world, is like yellow snow
With you it's white ones again

I told you that I would not leave you (wee-hah)
You thought that I was playin games (pow pow pow pow)
So behind my back, you kissed another man
When I found out I said it's, a shaaaaame

I told you I would call the po-lice
She kicked this man out of my house
I heard somethin squeakin way in the back room
And I know that it wasn't a mouse

I'm hotter than ice for ya baby
I hope our love will never end
Without you my world, is like yellow snow
With you it's white ones again

I only went out to get pizza
And when I came back you, was gone
That was pretty cold, it was colder than ice
My whole world turned to yellow snow

You know I just went plum from crazy
Ass kickin me in the butt with a boot
I pulled out my gun and I aimed it at my head
When I thought about you I did not shoot

I'm hotter than ice for ya baby
And I hope our love ne-verrr ends
Without you my world, is like yellow snow
With you, it's white ones again HEYYYY

Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee-ha~! Wee-ha!
Go little doggies, ha hee hee
Yeah that's right ha ha
Weeeeeee-ha! Woo woo woo
Yeah yeah yeah what, ha ha ha
Yeah, yeah what c'mon, we gon' take it home now aight
Here we go, one more time
C'mon everybody sing this c'mon now

I'm hotter than ice for ya baby
And I hope our love never ends
Without you my world, is like yellow snow
With you, it's white ones againnnnnnn

I'm hotter, than ice for ya baby
And I hope, our lover will never end
Without you, my world, is like yellow snow
With you it's white, ones againnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
