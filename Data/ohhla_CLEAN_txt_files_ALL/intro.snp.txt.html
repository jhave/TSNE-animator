[George Clinton]
As I take another choken toke of icky sticky stanky
Stuff a bull, pack a pipe, twist a blunt, roll and light a joint
Lean back and puff slow {*echoes*}

[Snoop Dogg]
Whenever I'm makin a record, I'm gettin into my character
And I'm tryin to portray somethin that I'm feelin so that way the whole
world can believe in it
Do anybody know my name!?
{*crowd cheers*} What's my name!?
(Snoop Dogg!) What's my name!?
(Snoop Dogg!) Hold on, I want y'all to say my name like dis..
(Snoop, Snoop, Snoop, Snooooop)
There are seven wonders in the world, you're about to witness the eighth
({*Jay-Z sample*} Nigga ask about me, nigga ask about me!)
You don't believe me? Motherfucker say what!?
Aiyyo Cat, roll out the blue carpet cuzz
Lemme C-walk on these niggaz

Blue hat, blue socks, blue shoes, too cool
Blue car, blue house, blue pit, blue pool
Blue grass, blue Coupe, blue b-ball hoop
What kind of phone you on Loc? I'm on the Bluetooth
Talkin to my nephew, my nigga Boo, half who?
He make pimpin on a bitch look so cool
Old school, old fools, steel on a nigga first
Run up with that punk shit and I fill up a nigga's shirt
Do it to it hurt 'cause it hurt so bad (so bad!)
Snoopy D O dub they can't touch yo' swag (yo' swag!)
Oh mark ass nigga better tuck yo' flag
'Cause when my music out loco, I come to smash yo' ass
Fuck him, fuck her, and fuck all y'all too
(He wants everything to be right) 'Cause I'm... (Snoop Dogg!)
I'm so hood, so true
and every time that you see me cuzz, I'm oh so blue!
(To get that you have to stay.. on top of your game)
(And learn the most specific lesson...)
That shit is dope right there God...</pre>
