Talking: Yeah, they gon' hate this one
They gon' hate us cause we love Him so much
But it's finna go down dawg
Yeah we gon' represent Him tonight

[Verse One]
You can find me in a church
Focused and alert
No suit and tie, jeans and a t-shirt
I'm into praising God because he made us out of dirt
And plus he gave His life for this world's evil works
So flirt with that
Most of y'all can't jerk with that
Cause it ain't no benefits and no perks with that
Still gotta' live your life on this earth with that
But we live eternally and I can work with that
Holla, yeah I cheated, yeah I lust within
But guess what that's why I trust in Him
See you thinkin' that you ain't that bad
You just lying to yourself playboy you better check your health
While you're all about the cash and ice
Hope you ready for change you just broke the first commandment twice
And I know that you done stole before
If it wasn't a gun it was some gum from the grocery store
It's all sin to God
Man look into God
You guilty, you ain't even a friend to God
Sin gotta' high price it'll cost your life
But God fit that bill on the cross with Christ

[Chorus]
The crossover from death to life
What's the hold up accept the Christ
We flex the Mic to rep for Christ
So we can put your soul at rest tonight

[Verse Two]
Yo
I don't catch the Spirit I'm all filled up
I can't lose it either I'm all sealed up
And you can bet yo life
I'm a rep for Christ
One taste He'll get you right
Folks is thinking they Christian
But when they sinnin'
They don't feel the conviction that the Spirit is givin'
And they keep living life like, "That's cool with me."
Y'all people ain't fooling me
Try to play me to the left like I'm trying to get deep on them
This is real talk dawg, you better peep somethin'
This ain't that philosophic rap like 'Harmoynm'
And I ain't talking about the God you heard about from mom and them
Put that blunt out dawg, put down the Heineken
"Man God understands" What? Come again
I guess you think that God is kinda' like yo momma huh?
Like he ain't even trippin' on your sinnin and your drama

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Yo, life's way more then ice and rims
And you don't make enough to pay the price of sin
And God's gon' judge you dawg that's reality
Saying you don't believe is like saying there ain't no gravity
Then running off to go jump a cliff
And when you hit the ground tell me what you get
Hey, why you running from the freedom of the gospel?
You hostile
You're looking like your Lucifer's apostle
But God got you
And though we all deserve death he still keep putting breath in your nostrils
But you treat Him like an obstacle
See Him come at your convenience like a stop and go
Waiting for a sweeter deal or a sign or something
Like God ain't come down and die or something
Trust me dawg God wants the best for you
That's why the gospel of Christ is addressed to you

[Chorus]</pre>
