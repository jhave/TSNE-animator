[Chorus]
Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
My pockets look like Rerun, your pockets look like Raj
Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
My pockets look like Rerun, your pockets look like Raj

[Snoop Dogg]
It's the same story, a nigga rich
I'm on some nigga shit, and yo' nigga bitch
You better check him, tell him I'm off the chain
I buck and bang, homie that's on the gang
Oh I ain't got a problem, you see me gettin' stacks
You see I bought the Phantom, 24's don't come with that
I've been around the world, check grip in every state
Yo' bitch don't like me, she fake, some people might call it hate
But I don't give a damn, a bosses life is how I make that bread
Toss the mic and I'll still be richer than rich and have yo' bitch make my bed
My pockets fat as shit, you niggaz mad as shit
Pumps "Neither One of Us", I'm on some Gladys shit
Many have tried and failed, shit I'm out on bail
I make more cheese than your old man and he went to Yale
Shit I went to jail, you can go to hell
You got some shit to tell? I got some shit for sale

[Chorus]
(I got) Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
My pockets look like Rerun, your pockets look like Raj

[Snoop Dogg]
Candypaint drippin', look at all them bags
Had to show and brag, 'cause bein' broke's a drag
I gotta get this paper, my kids they gotta eat
We got a lot of heat, just case them dollars cease
Been out for ballin', shot callin' I make that change
And I don't want the Range, chop that trey on thangs
That's how them gangstas do it, we get our green in bricks
We put our green in blunts, you spend your green on chicks
I'm on some player shit, dynasty, straight Laker shit
Cook it up on some baker shit and chop it up for some paper bitch
I got my mind right, and my money right
If you ain't in the game for the money you the funny type
And I'm laughin' my ass off, Phantom with the mask off
Legal so they hatin' when I gas off
You know how Snoopy does it, Phantom don't bitch touch it
One hundred thousand a show, I'm gettin' doe like fuck it

[Chorus]
(I got) Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
My pockets look like Rerun, your pockets look like Raj

[Snoop Dogg]
Look how that flag hangin', gangbang and I ain't no punk
Maintain 'til that thang come out the trunk, make that K go pump-pump-pump
I'm bout my business boy, makin' money never been so smooth
Your bitch you 'bout to lose, 'cause she about to choose
And that's the way it goes, S-N double-One
You want that quiet type, I want that trouble hoe
Now go get paper girl, yeah I meant for real
One time I told a bitch not to come back 'til she got $2,000 in $2 bills
That's cold game, the whole thang
I'm high as Soul Plane, I smoked the whole thang
You know how daddy do it, I'm true to it
I take a cocaine Buick and put some blue to it
That's some gangsta shit, these hoes love this gangsta dick
Khakis and some gangsta kicks, yeah bitch that's my gangsta fit
I'm ballin' boy, and you ain't got to ask
She all about this pimpin', I'm all about this cash

[Chorus]
(I got) Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
(I got) Stacks in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
My pockets look like Rerun, your pockets look like Raj
(I got... I got... I got... I got)
My pockets look like Rerun, your pockets look like Raj</pre>
