[Andre 3000]
Yeah this one right here goes out to all the baby's mamas, mamas...
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas, mamas
Yeah, go like this

[CHORUS: Andre 3000]
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH], I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH], I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Big Boi]
My baby's drama mama, don't like me
She be doin things like havin them boys come from her neighborhood 
to the studio tryin to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I PAY THAT
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit; you never got a chance 
to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts 
for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

[Chorus]

[Andre 3000]
Me and yo' daughter.. gots this thang goin on
(We got a special kind of thang goin on)
You say it's puppy love (arf arf arf)
We say it's full grown (ARF ARF WOOF!)
Hope that we feel this.. feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
but you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; find
the quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
on the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder
thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Askin what happened to the feelin that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everythang's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation

[Chorus]

[Big Boi]
Uh, uh, yeah
"Look at the way he treats me" 
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass homegirls 
done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle 
and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin no more 
cause my dick all in her mouth
Knahm'talkinbout?  Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing
So who you placin the blame on, you keep on singin the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
