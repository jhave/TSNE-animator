Right, right!  (Woy)
Bring it (Woy)
BDP (Woy)
BDP (Woy)
BDP (Woy)
Now smooth it out (Woy, Woy)
(Woy)
(Woy)
(Woy)
Alright, here we go (Woy, Woy)

Hi, hello, whassup, and what's happenin?
I am known as the teacher in rappin
Some need slappin, cause what they're sayin
is wack and weak and - wait, let me speak (Woy)
Don't be the sucker comin into my face with that (Woy)
yang-yang, or you'll be down with the chain gang (Woy)
Draggin your feet, to a beat produced by BDP (Woy)
One of the many, from the library (Woy)
I teach HIP-HOP for a living
So here's a smidgen, of what I'm givin
KRS-One two three four, encore
I'm not a freshman, sophomore, and further more (Woy)
I graduated from the school of no shorts
to the world of rappin I brought
"That's it, that's all, single, no more, no less"
That style was created by DJ KRS (Woy)
Offbeat got you out your seat (Woy)
When I created the style, they studied every single week (Woy)
Now you come in my face like you're rulin? (Woy)
But I'm teacher boy, who you foolin!
See there's no defense against common sense
confidence, intelligence or excellence
Intense, but here's the difference
KRS-One does NOT mean ignorance
Try obediance, magnificence
As a reference, STOP THE VIOLENCE
Criminal Minded, Poetry, and Jimmy Hats
Is that your title?  GIMME DAT!  (WOY)

(Woy)
(Woy)
(Woy)
Now let's take it back a little bit (Woy, Woy)

(Woy)
(Woy)
You can't test BDP boy (Woy)
So bust this down (Woy, Woy)

While I got your attention I feel like just
lettin off two or three lyric then steppin
JETTIN, gettin the respect of a teacher
My name is Kris, 23, glad to meet ya
BDP +is+ the number one set
I don't DROP science, I teach it, correct!
Some get caught in my style like a net
They can't get out, so I treat em like a pet
Sit boy, down boy, don't bite me yet
I bet you're kind of hungry, here's a CalCan, step
Cause I've got no time to hold your hand
I just SLAM, so you can understand who I am (Woy)
The teacher, professor, scholar makin dollars (Woy)
The trainer, entertainer, makin ya holla (Woy)
The numero uno, number one, the best perfectionist (Woy)
Crazy, fresh KRS (Woy, Woy)
So GIMME DAT!

(Woy)
(Woy)
(Woy)
Now take it on back (Woy, Woy)

Original.. original.. original.. hit it!

(Woy)

Original.. ah one two three, we out! (Woy, Woy)</pre>
