Shake that ass hoe (ass hoe)
And where my thug niggas at (there they go, there they go)

[Lil' Zane]
You see we real niggas (real niggas)
And confrontation make us kill niggas (kill niggas)
Our style make them bitches feel niggas (feel niggas)
This rap shit made us legit
And we still the same million dollar deal niggas
This flow (this flow)
I drop to let you motherfuckers know (fuckers know)
That you don't wanna go toe to toe (toe to toe)
Line for line (line for line)
Blow for blow
Sound for sound
Rhyme for rhyme
Don't forget we gets down (gets down)
We got the hottest groups up in the town (in the town)
We keep the baddest bitches dick down (dick down)
Hangin 'round (hangin 'round)
Doggystyle 
Jaws open 
Takin' dick 
Deep throatin
Weed smokin (weed smokin)
And all that liquor got my g's open (g's open)
My conversation got her knees open (knees open)
Her girl open (girl open)
Game tight

Both bitches
Same night

Chorus 2X

[Lil' Zane]
See when I first came (first came)
Half of yall didn't know my first name (first name)
But since the single all that shit changed (shit changed)
Cuz now these hoes know my first

And my nickname
Ride through (ride through)
Wishin' that you could be with my crew (my crew)
I know you see the shit that Z do (Z do)
We do (we do)
Boss howg 
Angenetta

Got plenty paper and we live fly (live fly)
Only the purple when we get high (get high)
Spit fire (spit fire)

Hotter flow
Stay laced (stay laced)
Roley wit diamonds in the gray face (gray face)
Porsche's and Bentley's in the same place (same place)

Yall still frontin
Fake ass niggas gon have to peel somethin'

Chorus 2X

[Uncle Luke]
Now yall niggas don't understand how the game go. Yo Zane, these niggas do 
not know how the game go. Yo, what u gon' have to do now, is you gon' have to 
flip the style up. You gon' have to speed that shit up, go another note. Yo 
Zane, this lil Zane, come on nigga what...

[Lil' Zane]
I'm poisonous
I give a fuck how many boys you get
Them faggot niggas can't avoid a clip
Avoid the shit quick
Put you back in ya right place
Stalk a nigga like a cat on a night chase
Niggas all in my space
Cuz they bitch like the face
A black jack
Shit, queen tryin' to ride the ace
My game lethal
Yall shit see through
I'ma turn the beat too
Yall know how we do
Ain't no equal
Runnin with this
Gunnin' with this 
Leave yall gorillas like one in the mist
I'm at the club just guzzlin' Cris'
Motherfuckers need to learn they ain't fuckin with this
Lil Zane keep a leafless
And a nigga keep heat by the brief waist
Tryin to flow
Hell naw I ain't vibin' to yall
Set fire to yall
Watch my niggas

Chorus 4X
