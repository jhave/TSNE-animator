Artist: Brother El
Album:  Through the Cracks of Concrete
Song:   Fade It
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Uhh!  Y'all know the scrilla
Watch the maneuver

[Verse One]
Check the action, tracks with traction, fact with fiction
Mix it, now that's faction, El got you relaxin
I'm camomile, volume sleepin pills
Head back but comin still
The production is fuel-injected, Speed Racer behind the wheel
Diesel beats real
As conversations on 43rd Street in the projects, slangin words
Hey fiends, sniff these verbs
Pick 'em up off the curbs
Tracks like tickets over twelve billion served
And, keep yo' hands out my pocket
Uhh, Brother El used to catch the L
Before he grabbed the mic and rocked it, in XL
Uhh, ballad in myself I do myself in a cell
Analyzed it, locked it in, and now I got it
Listen, there's, no competition make
beats with my alter-ego, sweat in my eyes, double vision

Incisions of small cuts to the veins of the brain
  Ya, y'all niggaz ain't right man, ya y'all niggaz ain't right!
Yeah, we gon' work it out witcha, mm-hmm, yeah just hold pat

[Chorus]
Whooped, massacred, raped, scarred
Ridiculed, under-educated and domesticated
Hardcore brother tryin to stay motivated
And what my cypher created the world try and fade it

[Verse Two]
How you feel?  I'm straight, but I could be better
I'm composin a letter, a letter for what?
A letter to state, showin the fate, of mankind
line for line
I'm livin decent but I'm cryin; I'm sick of tryin to
come up on a grip, don't slip, that's easy
I step in military formation
Pacin the cold streets, dark nights, and gang fights
over, territory, that ain't right, I might
just step back and react on a different plane
Change the slang, watch the devils go insane
cause they don't understand a damn thang
Life ain't the same when you use your brain
Reveal the name, don't be estranged
They not ready to see the true blackness
In fact this is a whole new concept but I'll keep you in step
Oooh!  Watch the moves it's a dusty groove
And I, come with bullshit to make hits
I, hold the essence of effervescence, now
.. uhh, learn your lessons!

[Chorus]</pre>
