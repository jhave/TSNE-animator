What is it? From the mixed up files of Fazzle T. Frankenwiler, 
or something like that?
Mixed up files, powerful files

Verse 1:
It's the last days, Jocks think pussies are ash trays
And artsy-farts have more baggage than Samsonite
Those ancient Hamptonites, they're always like, "I can't tonight"
And men who are too beautiful are too dutiful with their cuticles
Plus it's like conversasion with a carpeted cubicle
I was eating food when a dude pseudo-suitable said,
"My rap talk's the back drop from laptop to blacktop
You certainly appear to be mightily stacked up
My iconoclastic rap schtick, gets my jimmy waxed like Chapstick
I think LL Cool J and Canibus are BOTH fantastic
So-called experts can't see how the text works
So they comb through the textures of italicized excerpts"
Believe me, it sucks acting impressed
Plus the whole time he rhymed he stared at my breasts
At best he was neither ugly nor dumb
I guessed I'd rearrange the boredom
And make it into bedroom, I said, "Let's go Max like Headroom"
We brought the ruckus like Red Grooms
On the couch where we made out with my hand on his paunch
He invited me to march in the Million Sperm Launch
The fun talk stopped when we heard the front door unlock
His dad made such a grand entrance, 
dude, you'd think we'd need sunblock
At long last he walked past and let out a calm blast of bombast
Before he could set down he briefcase, I said, "You're a quief-face
Go back to Boston"

Chorus: (fast over rock hard guitars)
When I want some, I get some
I'll wade through the flotsam and jetsam
Til I've met some smart hotties and caught 'em
My parents named me Autumn
But now I'm fricking awesome

Verse 2:
Next I took the Express to 86th and Lex
Flexed my Metrocard back in my wallet and
Walked to the Metropolitan, The Great Hall 
Had hundreds of boys straight out of "Eightball", wait, Paul
Barman was posted at his station
He said, "For students there's a $5 suggested donation"
Our eyes met 
It's nice to be hypnotized by a man you don't despise yet
He had a type of flow and I can't quite label it
All I know it made me want to take off my cableknit
Sweater, Oh he better be hetero
I hope they don't catch us in the Lila Acheson
Wallace Wing when Paulus brings the mattress in--rudely
He backlashed my booty
like I was Susan Faludi over the Grace Rainey Rogers Room rostrum

Chorus: 
When I want some, I get some
If I'm lost in the flotsam and jetsam
I'll draw some
L'acoste alligators chasing an opossum.....
But now-  I'm frigging awesome
When I want some, I get some
If I'm lost in the flotsam and jetsam
I'll draw some
L'acoste alligators chasing an opossum.....
I'm frigging awesome
