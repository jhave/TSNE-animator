[Intro] [J-Zone speaking] (Celph Titled)
Yeah, dedicated to that funky bitch who had lava drippin' out my dick. (Burnin') 
Bitch you burned me. It's okay. Fuck that bitch
(Kill a bitch) I had to kill her
She died over a long, painful...bitch had to go
(Yeah) You know what I'm sayin'? She had to go
(Fuck that hoe) Bitch burned me you know? 
Prince B where you at? (Fa sho) Motherfucker
(Holla) Check this shit out. (Burnin') 
Goin' straight Z100 on you hoes
Havin' these, hahaha, hood motherfuckers at the clinic and shit. Check it out. 

[Chorus] [J-Zone] [x2]
Baby you burnt me (dadadadada)
You funky bitch
Baby you burnt me (dadadadada)
Said the bitch gave syphilis to me

[Verse One] [J-Zone]
Bacardi Rasp, pour in my glass
Behind the bar I scoped that ass
Other lady with the fat ole' thing
But you know I can't remember her damn name
Bitch gave me head that's fine
Wanted to fuck so I went for mine
Next day I was off to work
Had to take a piss, stop in Eckert
Tried to use the bathroom in there
Pulled out my dick and took a piss up in there
Dick started burnin' then
I realized she burned me but never again
Went to here house, she said I looked lovely
Beat the bitch to death with my shovel
Dug a hole with the shovel, there she rest
For givin' me syphilis

[Chorus] [J-Zone] [x2]
Baby you burnt me (dadadadada)
You funky bitch
Baby you burnt me (dadadadada)
Said the bitch gave syphilis to me

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]
Yo, a pair of bitches skeezin' at the liquor stand
Notice me and said they was a Celph Titled fan
Baggin' hoes at night clubs, a dangerous thing
But all that's on my mind is a bedroom fling
Caught the eye of one of 'em with cellulite thighs
She pushed up on me with a gut from eatin' too many fries
I said, "Bitch listen up, is we fuckin' or not?"
I'm so drunk she look like a fat Vivica Fox
Split to the spot to the Economy Inn
You's a bald head bitch so that's probably a wig
Couldn't find a rubber, now we gettin' it on
Her ass so big, can't find the string to her thong
I was wrong but the Congnac was makin' it right
Woke up the next mornin' thinkin' back, I hated that night
Mosey to the bathroom in a zombie daze
God damn this fuckin' bitch got me pissin' razor blades
Strangled the bitch
Her double chins were swollen
Wish I could of took a flick for a Kodac moment
But I had to kill the bitch just like the rest
That's the way it goes
You beiotch

[Chorus] [J-Zone] [x2]
Baby you burnt me (dadadadada)
You funky bitch
Baby you burnt me (dadadadada)
Said the bitch gave syphilis to me</pre>
