[Intro: Ne-Yo]
Uh, ohhh-ohhhh.. ohh-OH!
Oooo-oooooohhh-ooh... {M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Mm, get out of my head, get into my bed
Come to me now, I'm tired of dreaming about you, baby
{*harmonizing*}
Ooh, get out of my head, get into my bed
Come to me now, I'm tired of dreaming about you, baby
{*harmonizing*}

[Wale]
Fame has made me more foolish, uh
What would you do with all these lusty groupies? Uh
And I know that God has made me only human
But I'd like to take the time to describe to y'all my favorite woman
Look.. teeth, white and bright and still talk to me like we back home
And the weave? That's optional cause my only concern's that her head's strong
And her feet? Lemme see; course you know I like them clean
And I can understand a little bruise; you've been runnin' through a nigga's mind all damn week
And ooh, I won't OD, you'll get D, young as 19
I believe age is for math, all I need is chemistry, yeah
Cause shawty be the glory, until my dream real
And I like a good story, I bet she got a mean tail
Ralph!

[Interlude: Ne-Yo]
Your little attitude and the way you make your moves
That shit is 'hella cute, baby...
Girl, I've been lookin' for you cause of the things we do
In my dreams, how I be makin' you scream; I wake up like...

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
HUH! {Maybach Music}
When I look in your soul, all I see is the gold
Her beauty is blindin', she's in total control
Her emotions at peace, let's walk the shoreline (HUH!)
Statuesque as can be, we're spending more time
Sky-dweller moving counter-clockwise
A perfect 10, I'm watchin' you through God's eyes
Bonita Applebum (WOO!) - my strawberry letter (WOO!)
Love Potion #9 (WOO!) this shit's a gifted era (HUH!)
If this is wrong, you my co-defendant
As we plead guilty, to this life sentence
Choosy lovers (HA!) - she my block goddess
I love the realist (HUH!) -- rock solid
