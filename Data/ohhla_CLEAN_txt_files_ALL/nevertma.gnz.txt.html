Ya know what we doin here

Young, H-O-V
From the number one, R-O-C

[Verse One - Young Neef]
Yo its a big payback
Revenge at the tip of my lips
Grip on my fifth and brought my big K back
Y'all don't understand some of the pain I go through
Half of y'all can't even dig it
Y'all can't even picture
A motherfucker killin someone you close to
And they say its over someone you close to
And they family approach you
And you dealin wit his family emotions
And these motherfuckers say you ain't focused at the same time
But they wasn't on the same vibe
I remain calm
This aim mine when its game time
Though you gone dog you spirit still wit us
For the clueless we just clearin the picture
And we airin them niggaz
Ridin hard 'til we bury them wit'cha
Show you how much we care for you niggaz
And I'm ready to pop
My crew to 'for they let me get popped
Rest in piece A-L, O-reddy, and Hop
(They'll Neva Take Me Alive!!!) [Both Young Neef and Young Chris]

[Verse Two - Jay-Z]
The commission was our vision
We ain't it see it come to fruition
We ran outta time dam
You think I'm just a fan you out your mind
That was my motherfuckin man and my partner in crime
Big you had the Mafia
Me, I got the Property
Got a lot of these fake families out here copyin
But nigga trust Ima flush all this bullshit
All this fake Tupac and fake Suge shit
We ain't the first to make hood shit
We ain't invent the wheel
But we made the Goodrich tire
And Now we hood rich
And I rhyme like my momma still in the hood shit
But my momma got V12 under the hood
She got C-L on back of the 6
Now my only job is to help little Chris
Get his momma out this bitch
Avoid the drama out this bitch

[Verse Three - Young Chris]
Just lost another one
We'll always love you dog
Just like my mother son
My second brother dog
They say we go to hell
When he die we ain't lose 'em
But Hov say "throw it up" so we gotta keep it movin
So me I maintain
But its stress on my brain
But your death ain't in vain
Lost my breath when it came and uh
They say we joyce in death but the pain
Best believe my first boy gon' be blessed wit your name
All that's left is your face on the picture
On my dresser in the frame
And it just ain't the same I'm like
Dam man, how my another homey missin
Not to mention big homey stressin
Where do I go for advice
Man its shows every week
But its bodies every night
Men is cold on these streets and uh
Niggaz know the police
And the drama its still there
And my  momma she still there

[Verse Four - Jay-Z]
Now its no turnin back, its like a gat
Once you pull it dog you never put it back 'til you clap
Tell the hood I'm back this ain't rap
This is shit I'm just tellin you on a track, I relax
Niggaz fell into the trap
You like a puppet wit no strings
We hella good at that, in fact
Exactly where you at is where we wanted you for months
So we could come thru wit Mack and hrrrraatt
This is war my niggaz
Y'all niggaz is drawn like cartoon figures, its a fact
We pour out a little liquor cause we lost a couple niggaz
But we bout to get y'all back, we sat
We plotted y'all demise
Got a box wit yo' size and your name attached
How you lu'dat
Its only right
B-I in L-A
God bless your life
