[Hook-Buckshot]
Opposites attract
So you can fall back if you think you all that, miss
It's about that time
On the street, with the hustle, everyday I'm about that grind
So you can play the side, 'cause I'ma get mine
I don't wait up and I don't waste time
But I notice, I roll with
My head up when I walk, so I stay Focused

[Verse 1-Starang Wondah]
Hey yo, I usually ain't into chasin' the mommy's
Get it then I hit it like Jason Giambi
Until I met Wendy up in Envy
She had a coupe and a Bentley, the inside Fendi
Hey yo, she friendly, far from your average groupie
The hoochie ate sushi and kept her coochie in Gucci
I knew she was checkin' me out
Then locked in her sight, she never lettin' me out
We parkin' lot pimpin', frontin' on a celly
Mesmerized by the tattoo on her belly
I came with Sean P, she came with Tawana
You shoulda seen those ho's ass in these Dolce Gabbana's
And there's somethin' about her, made me shake the ho's off
And I ain't touch her, but I could tell she was so soft
And I seen baller's tryin' to floss to show off
Now I'm like Biz Mark', about to 'Go Off'
They hit the dance floor, dancin' to Chingy
Dressed up kinky, movin' all freaky
Hey yo, I like the way she shake it 'Right Thurr'
Dancin' in the mirror, playin' with her hair
She tried to act like she didn't notice me stare, man
I walked up to her like I ain't care
Made eye contact, I knew I had a chance
When we danced, the hooker put her hands in my pants
I'm So Focused...

[Verse 2-Buckshot]
It's hard enough tryin' to get by
What's the reason we gotta look fly?
Shorty said that she did 'til the day that I cry
Then she looked to the side when that nigga walk by
She said she want some wisdom
Then the SL came and she felt wind come
Income will show the outcome
And if you get it, then you lose it, well nigga, you're outdone
How come? I think she make the best salesman
'Cause she can sell men anything for that tail end
Girlfriend, a nigga will spend what he have to
For that ass, too, fuck around and spend his last two
Let me ask you, you ever got some nigga
Who found out through some gossip nigga his pocket's hit up
Damn, you see how bitches think
That's why I'm runnin' like my kitchen sink
I don't blink, I'm So Focused

[Verse 3-Steele]
I wake up in the mornin', give thanks for the moment
Plan, plot, strategize, keep my third eye focused
Watch for the rodents
Silence the cold when the police approachin'
Livin' my life as a soldier
Just like roller coaster, all that glitters ain't golden
Keep toast when I'm posted, don't boast 'bout what I'm holdin'
I keep fam close, enemies even closer

[Verse 4-Tek]
I'm seen in these streets on the daily
Snuffin' you underneath the sun, you can tell me
About what's the opposite sex, what's poppin' on the set
You couldn't get it so you needed my connect
You ain't look for the shit I went through
Don't worry 'bout it, when you seem him, tell him that I sent you
And please don't use my name in vein
I'm so focused, daddy, I'm on top of my game
