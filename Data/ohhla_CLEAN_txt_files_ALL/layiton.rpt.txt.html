(Intro-Kurupt)
Yeah, gangsta's make the world go round
I heard that's true
Make things go up and down
I heard that's true

(Verse 1-Kurupt)
I been through the full-court pressure stage
The homies gave me a nine
The first time I saw a gauge
The first time I put my feet...
Down solid mashin on top of concrete
Before all the ways of war
House and car doors felt the rays of war
When life was simple as shit
And we didn't give a fuck about a bitch, 1986
It's all about lic's, heat in the streets
Trucks with the beats
Bitches with biker shorts worn all tight
Tryin to get a pussy just worn all night
Plus you had to be a baller to get the baddest ho's
Back in the days, 6-4 six trays
Back in the days, Elco's, S-S's
The best is where the west is niggaz don't test us 

(Chorus X4-DJ Lethal)
Just lay it on back (Hey)
Do you wanna ride?

(Verse 2-Fred Durst &amp; Kurupt)

(Fred Durst)
Back in the days where them laces were thick
I was concerned with break dancin and layin some dick
For whatever it's worth, I'm still doin the smurf
And I'm walkin on this Earth, like I don't give a fuck
And now I'm rollin up in third gear
With 3 dollar bills, 3 more minutes to kill
3 more seconds to snap, 3 more bottles of beer
And corrupt's my lifestyle, so shut the fuck up
And back the fuck up with that buck free style

(Kurupt)
Nigga what freestyle, nigga

(Fred Durst)
Walkin on a razor blade

(Kurupt)
Comin through I got it made, posted up in the shade
Comin through to get paid
Sunny California baby

(Fred Durst)
I got dubbs in my trunk and it's bound to bump
Straight smashin, hollerin out what's up Kurupt?

(Kurupt)
Wassup, I'm fillin in my right mind, one to the head
And I'm on the smash hollerin out what's up Fred?'

(Chorus X4-DJ Lethal)
Just lay it on back (Hey)
Do you wanna ride?

(Verse 3-Nate Dogg)
I don't give a fuck so fuck what they say
Nigga won't you pass, say pass the bombay
Niggaz they decide to ride and they ride
Niggaz they decide to lie and they die
I can bust a fleet of ho's with my skills
I can make them ho's bow down pay my bills
Can't think I can make them ho's convert to my will
Wanna bet I'll turn them ho's to my scrill'
If you love a bitch a bitch can drive you crazy
Anything a hooker do it won't amaze me
You better be up on your game homie cuz they be
They may talk a lot of shit but they can't fade me
If you hang around with suckaz then you may be...
Anotha type of brotha I don't want with me
When you compensate with bustaz you confuse me
Cuz I'm tryin to stay out the penitentiary

(Chorus X4-DJ Lethal)
Just lay it on back (Hey)
Do you wanna ride?</pre>
