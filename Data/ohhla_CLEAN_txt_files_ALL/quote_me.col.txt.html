Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Haha uh
Yeah, uh
Yeah, Yo
Bear with a nigga man
Gotta a little head cold, ya know?
I'll still kill it nigga
Show y'all niggaz how it do
Real Quick
Uh

You know what they say
The window to the soul is in the eyes
So disrespect a nigga, I will close a nigga blind
Yeah who can hold us? Super focused
Shoot them hoes with the super soakers
I got 'em so wet, fuck that, more wet
I'm Hennessy drinking
Wonder what my enemies' thinking
Nervous? nigga, please
I'm finna be caking with dough-
So much bread, it's like a nigga be baking
Walk that's so cold, this shit will need blankets
Money coming soon, tell my niggaz be patient
We gonna replace those whips with some sicker ones
We gonna erase them chicks for some thicker ones
Hit and run, bigger funds
But still can't forget to pour liquor
As I reminisce on them niggaz that couldn't come
Rest in peace, can't control another man's destiny
So I do what's best for me
I know you think niggaz well, ain't no test to me
On my plate is a meal, ain't no recipe- for that
Some nigga chill on the tech, no speak, blaaat
Some niggaz will put your chest to feet
I'm talking reckless
What you expect nigga, I'm flexing
Y'all dyslexic, got a nigga twisted
Never shot a nigga, I don't gotta get convicted
Cause if I say the word, your whole squad is getting lifted
What up then? Niggaz ain't saying nothing? Shut up then!
Wouldn't last a minute in the city I grew up in
Where I got my swag, cool as the breeze is
Chip on my shoulder, I walk like I'm Jesus
About that paper, we could give a fuck if you believe us
Looking for model divas that barely speak English
Fuck 'em while we rich, cause when we broke, they gonna leave us
We earn stripes, looking like zebras
Y'all looking like Adidas
We do it for the streets, cause they need us
Got beef? Come meet us
Ok I thought so
Y'all niggaz are so mad cause I floss so bad on bitches
And with this stroke, I'm Picasso
Niggaz told me good afaso
Now she yelling out God so much, thought I had her singing gospel
Shit, shout out to my apostle
Shit, you know me, nicest nigga in the south
Yea you can quote me!
Wooo Shit!
Haha
Ooooh Shit, mother fucker!
Hahaha
Oohh Shit
And I'm sick bitch, holla at me!
You know!
Fuck boy!</pre>
