"Shimmy Shimmy Ya" shimmy yam, shimmy yay
I'm a +Ol' Dirty+ dog all day
No way Jose
Your girl only go one way, ay mi madre
You should check that out, he he
Maybe you ain't turn her out, he he
Maybe it's none of my business
But for now work it out let's get this, dale

[Jennifer Lopez] + (Pitbull)
Nobody knows what I'm feeling inside
I find it so stupid so why should I hide
that I... love to make love to you baby
(Yeah, make love to me)
So many ways wanna touch you tonight
I'm a big girl got no secrets this time
Yeah I... love to make love to you baby
(Yeah, make love to me)

[Chorus]
If this would be a perfect world
we'd be together then
(Let's do it, do it, do it)
Only got just one life this I've learned
Who cares what they're gonna say?
(Let's do it, do it, do it)
I wanna dance, and love, and dance again
I wanna dance, and love, and dance again

[Pitbull: repeat 2X]
Dance, yes
Love, next

[Jennifer Lopez] + (Pitbull)
Baby your fire is lighting me up
The way that you move boy is reason enough
That I... love to make love to you baby
(Yeah, make love to me)
I can't behave, oh I want you so much
Your lips taste like heaven so why should I stop?
Yeah I... love to make love to you baby
(Yeah, make love to me)

[Chorus]

[Jennifer Lopez: repeat 2X]
Let's do it loud, and make it last
Cause baby nothing should matter tonight

[Pitbull]
Mr. Worldwide
And the world's most beautiful woman
Modern day Hugh Hef' - uh, yes)
Playboy to the death - uh, yes)
Is he really worldwide? Uh, yes~!!
Mami let me open your, treasure chest
Play dates, we play mates
I'm the king snatching queens, checkmate
What you think? It's a rumor
I'm really out of this world - moon, luna
Make woman comfortable call me bloomer
Can't even show love cause they'll sue ya
But I told them, "Hallelujah, have a blessed day"
So ahead of myself, everyday's yesterday
Want the recipe? It's real simple
Little bit of vole, and she'll open sesame
Now dance, yes
Love, next
Dance, yes
Love, next

[Chorus]</pre>
