[Chorus]
Let me get your mind right

[Verse One: MURS]
Got a letter from my home boy
He shot a kite
Tryin' to find out exactly what happened that night
It said, "Dear MURS,
It was routine work
At the enemy
Heat under the shirt
He took us back to the block and
Here come the cops
So we think the heats  
Same ass questions
Same ole bullshit
But in my back pocket, I forgot I had a full clip
I played it quiet
Just sat around
Then the rookie cop said that he had to pat me down
What's about to happen now?
That's what I thought when they cuffed me
Now there's fruit punch in this bullshit lunch meat
But trust me
I'm gonna be home soon
Cause the LA county ain't got enough room
Until then
One love and I'm out
And until I get home 
Keep my heat at your house"

[Chorus: x2]

[A.G.]
They got me in a cell homes
Sittin' here in these jail clothes
Future unknown
Over shit that was said on a cell phone
Case is well known
We made the papers
Incriminating evidence from letters I mailed home
Shit is real
I look pale, I feel alone
They froze the bank account
Closed the nail saloon
And niggas in here wanna test the kid
Like I ain't a wild hood with a fucked up childhood
Should I plead the fifth and don't say shit?
Make the D.A. prove the case when he look upon my face?
Will they see the hate and anger of a young black man?
Sayin' to myself, "Damn, I know I should have ran."
My lawyer keep tellin' me to take a plea
My lady said she'll wait for me
We know that's make believe
Go ahead and exhale
Don't wait to breath
I think you suffered enough
And I just keep fuckin' it up
Get your mind right for you die in a blaze
Get you ready for the tombs if you get knocked buying the haze
Keep you icey when your wife gets creepin' 
Plus feel your hunger pains when your gang ain't eatin'
Let me get your mind right for you die in a blaze
Get you ready for the tombs if you get knocked buying the haze
Keep you icey when your wife gets creepin' 
Plus feel your hunger pains when your gang ain't eatin'

[Chorus]</pre>
