[Erick Sermon]
Mm-hmm, hold me down
Hold me down
Hold me down
Ah yeah yeah hold me down
Yeah uh-huh uh-huh, hold me down
Word up, ye-yeah, a-yeh, to hold me down
Eh te eh te eh, hold me down
Word to, everybody that, hold me down
Huh?  Ah-huh, yo, what?

Aiyyo P back me up now, hold me down
while I go around this town, snatchin crowns
from those supposed, wannabe rap vocalists
If you nice get your rope and dosey-do in this
Let me know somethin - you wanna fight?  Let's go somethin
If not, close your mouth and say nothing
Y'all imitations, fuckin up the whole situation
with sucker MC infiltration

[Parrish Smith]
Aiyyo straight up, you light MC's better get your weight up
I'm benchin three hundred and change, starvin cats get ate up
Ain't that ill?  How I can just stare, and watch the blood spill
from an unknown rapper, but now the rapper's no thrill
Now how real is that?  Burnin gats, knifes and bats
Hot rhyme, status, with the hot wax
Mixed with the street slang, is where it's at
Perhaps, you should close your mouth kid and slide back

[P]	Yo E, hold me down
[E]	I'm holdin you down
	Yo P, hold me down
[P]	I'm holdin you down
	Yo E, hold me down
[E]	I'm holdin you down
	PMD, hold me down
[P]	I'm holdin you down
	Yo E, hold me down
[E]	I'm holdin you down
	PMD, hold me down
[P]	I'm holdin you down
	Yo E, hold me down
[E]	I'm holdin you down
	PMD, hold me down
[P]	I'm holdin you down

[Parrish Smith]
You got shit harder than this, Erick Serm' and Parrish Smith?
What's this?  Piped out five, with the kit?
And millions to back it, keep it rugged never wack kid
This ain't just rhymin, God's on the way, and he's askin
who's been followin the rules, two noided, so we strap tools
and can't cool, this go out to the cats in school
It's not the norm, word bond, so get ready for the rainstorm
Too hot, fuck lukewarm, when we swarm

[Erick Sermon]
Yeah we swarm MC's with the bee effect, zzzzz, sting em
like Muhammad, set the scene I'm bombin on
CEO's, A&amp;R's, street team to a manager
For the cream, we damage ya
On light-skinned, dark-skinned, albino
From a crackhead, dopefiend, or wino
Bring the Ultra-ment, stick you with the Magnetic
Give a shout, to them sweet cats, rap diabetics

[E]	Yo P, hold me down
[P]	I'm holdin you down
	Yo E, hold me down
[E]	I'm holdin you down
	Yo PMD, hold me down
[P]	I'm holdin you down
	Yo E, hold me down
[E]	I'm holdin you down
	Yo PMD, hold me down
[P]	I'm holdin you down
	E-Dub, hold me down
[E]	I'm holdin you down
	Mic Doc, hold me down
[P]	I'm holdin you down
	Green Eyed Bandit, holdin it down
[E]	Yeah, I'm holdin you down

[Parrish Smith]
Niggaz tryin to jam the frequency, when on the low
they be peepin me and the E, DJ Scratch, EPMD
The Dream Team, who fiend for the cream since sixteen
Dodgin po-nine and marks, with the high beams
God-body, rap style, Mazerrati
Catchin bodies, E Double holdin shit down with the sawed off shotty
What you thought?  We takin more than nickels and shorts?
Get the fuck out of here, nothin sweet here, you get your shit torched

[Erick Sermon]
I spit flames at Oklahoma
When done, you can smell the Sermon aroma
In a coma, burned to death, man listen
Did he deserve, the kicked to the curb, ass whippin?
Believe you me, it was his destiny
for the child to end for fuckin with men
P and I got somethin for all y'all
who stand tall, and dose dat like to ball
So we ball like Spalding, in the time of need
who you calling when your career is falling?
Ssshh, way down, you've been hit, lay down
Hit the ground, don't get up, stay down
Relax a minute, you shouldn'ta put your two cents in it
Now you up a creek, in the back of a car that's rented </pre>
