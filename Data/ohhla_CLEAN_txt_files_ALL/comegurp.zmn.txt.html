[Z-Man]
I crawl outa bed about 8 in tha mornin'
start gurpin 8:30 today is my birthday
it's august 14th and I'm guzzling Rossi
I got me a 40 aint nothin gon' stop me
I'm awfully faded, made it, to a new year in my life
and everythings fine
my mind is altered at all
the party must start
when ending, I'm pushing rewind

[Z-Man - chorus]
now come on and gurp wit' me
getcha boogie on
now come on and gurp wit' me
little sister now
now come on and gurp wit' me
bring your momma too
and come on and gurp wit' me
we can all get down

[Z-Man]
theres more on the grillas, we blazin'
I puff on the dust and you takin'
your eyes are swelling with blood and I love it
we done it with juice and goose on her stomach
I need you to come and take shots of this stager
dont bother with chases, you'll thank me come swallow the Hypnotic tonic
your chest is burning from drinkin okro the kitchen is snow

[Z-Man - chorus]

[Z-Man]
wear tuxedos
push bleached through needles
so I dont catch nothin, come holla man
we drank our last dollar to dream about nothin but livin and lovin
no trippin just kissin and humpin
you suckin that nose candy
for o's Brandy, man she needs weed
she's crawlin the wall
breakin her nails and heels
?? her crank man, I'm off to the banquet
im hungry as fuck

[Z-Man - chorus]

[Z-Man]
gurp-ology
got me following
crowds who smile and swallow 'em down
so proud to mix the clear with brown
into grey ??, sip grapes, hit lace
and eighth to the face while I chase the drag
splash and askin your momma for dank
I pour out drank for PBF1
will of fiti
my boy Jon Jon
its on, the keg is full of Heineken
brew, r.i.p goes out to D
my girl's a problem, the other girls hate her
they hate when I bring her to parties like this
cuz she dont know shit about drankin'
can't relate, I shouldn't've brung her at all
hallucinating
mushrooms in my tea
adicted to 40's
good times good weed

[Z-Man - chorus]</pre>
