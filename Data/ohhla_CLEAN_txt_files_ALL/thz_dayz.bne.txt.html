(Krayzie Bone talking)
I'm representing motherfucking Thugline nigga (1999)
Motherfuckers wanna find the real thugs and hustlers, nigga (fucking bitches)
Come to the motherfucking ghetto where we from nigga
Now where the real thugs?

[Chorus - Krayzie Bone]
This is how we living these days {*repeat 8X*}
(And this is for my gangster, gangster, gangster)
(And that one's for my thugster, thugster, thugster)

[Krayzie Bone]
Nigga these days we killing much quicker to get us some paper, ya feeling me?
These days you got to be packing a gun everybody your enemy
These days it's every nigga for they self
Cause it ain't no such thing as friends
And well, so nice niggaz get left
And that's cause these days you got to be raw out here on the streets
Tell 'em these days you can't be fucking with niggaz that's weak
And these days no telling when you'll meet your coffin
I seen it too often that's why fuck flossing; I take caution
Don't trip, shit if your rich your rich
Cause if you slip somebody waiting to get
At you grab ya cash and split ya shit
These days stay in the low low and away from po-po
Unless you ready to pull your fo' fo' and blow (OH!)
How come these days niggaz wanna be the don of the mob?
They claim it but they never qualify for the job
These days we busting at motherfuckers quicker
Simply cause its 1999 nigga (nigga nigga nigga)

[Chorus]

[K-Mont]
Ay yo I'm straight out of the bricks and y'all ain't worthy to serve me
I'm the type that jump out your bushes and bust you with a 30, 30
You want beef? I pack pistol packing utilities
I'm the type of nigga that'll send letter bombs to all my enemies
I can't even walk the airport for being who I was
Police all on my dick because they recognize a thug
Nigga we trying to get money, we don't respect the police
Until us thugs unite it ain't gon' never be no peace
Niggaz be going to school with nothing but murder on they minds
Giving a fuck about teachers busting shot guns and nines
Picture the scenes and screams and everybody running
Get on your knees and pray nigga cause the son of the lord is coming

[Asu]
You know what came in time that's my frame of mind
Now I'm able to separate the deaf from the weak, dumb and the blind
Niggaz can't get none of mine, not even some of mine
Just cause you got on a watch nigga don't mean you know the time
You stagnating, you fags hating my motion
From ocean to ocean my magic potion is devotion
The nerve to hate what I deserve to do wasn't a curse it was a signal
That's why that ass crashed for got to put on your blinker
R-W-I: rolling while infatuated
I graduated, now I want my master
Y'all done agitated disaster
And at every ends I start I slip in the art with my heart and soul
And start to roll but dumb to come
Don't become the one I fold like the lawn chair
You shouldn't have gone there
What's the deal with the long stares?
What's the purpose? Jokers on earth surface to surface
And any problem is handled the same day as service (what what what what)

[Chorus]

[Bam]
We run the blocks stop the clocks turning rocks and dice
Set trip it's our spot gave y'all shots and let the drama pop
Don't escalate the 4-5-9 just try me dead or alive
Point of survival let's get points with real niggaz lives
But you only see raw meat on streets; these niggaz love their heat
Nowadays all busters wanna thug like me you see it be
Wasn't way so simple execution style pull the gristle
From the chair heard 'em whistle for my nigga mental
It's money, murder, riding dumping heads back to all of y'all
Since every nigga's all hard and proving they got the bigger balls
Scared of the laws told what he saw and what it lookeded like
Broke him off in the midnight I spared his life I said this shit is tight

[Chorus]
