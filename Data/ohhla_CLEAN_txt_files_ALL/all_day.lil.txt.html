[Intro]
Welcome to the underground hip-hop cypher!
Where we have the great Lil B!
West Coast MC in the building
Give this man a round of applause, please
See we don't have too many people in here tonight
But it's ok, cause this is real hip-hop
Let's go!
Good job, Lil B, spit for us

[Verse 1]
Watch out, I grind for the better days
Even for the rainy days
And niggas still getting paid
I'm like Magic
Don't brush and still getting waves
"Lil B, Lil B"
Swear to God I'm getting famous
I don't crack under pressure
Like them dinner plates
Made my own rules
A nigga never been a slave
Y'all getting raped for the money
Y'all getting AIDS
I'd rather see a better day
Nah, I'm never getting played
Niggas want to play a game
Bitch, I'll demonstrate
I'm not a killer, but I love to give fades
Fucking with the Boss, boy, the bitch gotta give me brains
Want to keep it simple as possible
Brrangdangdang
What's up, girl?
Brrangdangdang
Your sidekick...
Man, we can go aim for aim
Like Lil Wayne
Bitch I got bling bling
Bitch want to go to space
I'm like "I'm going to Sing Sing"

[Chorus]
Watch me spit fire
All day
Yo, watch me spit fire
All day
Yo, watch me spit fire
All day
Yo, yo watch me spit fire
All day
Yo yo, woah, woahhh

[Verse 2]
They ain't told me bout the game
I got [?]
Shitty niggas
They talking bout they cash flow
Blinded by the cash
Cars and the fast hoes
Lot of niggas won't help
Cause they ask wrong
My niggas, I smash on em
You feel me?
Just the jewelry, they want some
I don't want to listen to you when you're right
These niggas ain't your friends, man, they lost a million fights
It's a shady game
And it's darker in the reich
Until you bopping hoes
You gotta ride my bike
Because it's money on my mind, it's sitting left
The game is on the right and I'm trying to get a bite
Fuck it, get the whole half
I'm trying to get something
Basedworld, we going crazy
Fuck em and they cousins
This is
Motherfucking bad hoes
It's nothing
The game come with it
I love it, Lil B

[Chorus]
Watch me spit fire
All day
Yo, watch me spit fire
All day
Yo, watch me spit fire
All day
Yo, yo watch me spit fire
All day
Yo yo, woah, woahhh</pre>
