[MF Grimm]
Too dehydrated to cry, wonderin why
You scheme and you lie, hopin I die

Said I talk a lot of shit, but we all keep box strips
Searches find nothin, where's my hot pot
Wake me up at 5:30 in the morning, want to box
Run away like a little bitch, come back with bigger glocks
Grab my pen, law work, pussy put in grievances
Pack your shit, transfer, got me shackled head to toe
I can't move my legs but, they don't give a fuck though
I don't give a fuck so, no one give a fuck now
Tear 1, tear 2, tear 3, I'm upset
Special housing unit said, I made some death threats
They wasn't really death threats, okay yeah they were death threats
But it wasn't like I stabbed the C.O., in his fucking neck
I only want peace but he had to show some respect
And my people on the outside do squeeze tecs
He gotta leave here cause, this ain't where he's livin
He can't just be beatin on me cause I'm in prison
Nah, nah

Too dehydrated to cry, wonderin why
You scheme and you lie, hopin I die
Too dehydrated to cry, wonderin why
You scheme and you lie, hopin I die</pre>
