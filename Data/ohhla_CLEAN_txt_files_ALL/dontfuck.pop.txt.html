(*talking*)
What's the deal know I'm saying, go down mayn Laf-Tex
Bout to put it in these boys face, the Don nigga off top
Scrap to get it, bloohound know I'm saying
All us gotta eat mayn, so we gotta grind for it dog

[Hook - 4x]
Y'all really don't, wanna fuck with us

[Trae]
I'm a split em up nigga and a Southside real, when I grab the mic I'm guaranteed to bless
And guaranteed to wreck, they tal'n bout plex they guaranteed to snap necks and bust big techs
Better yet Mike just ball in the mix, scrape the block I'm in a big wide sip
AKA sit low Excursion, might knock off me a thoed Suburban
I'm a Don Dada street game rap scholar, ain't shit changed still in a Ramada
Running through boppers and doing it raw, when the city get broke I buy the mall
When I head to the sea I rock the wall, when I'm on v-dubs no time to stall
When I pull up on glass I'm known to crawl, and when I ride dirty I gotta dodge the laws
When thoed C-Loc when I'm on the d-low, me B and Jay'Ton you know we thoed
Body rocking in my drop top low, I rip the track and now I'm bout to explode
On the mic and drop game like bombs, debanere rap game phenomenon
Bout to bomb any nigga in sight, throwing bows with a big red light
End the night I ride on chumps, pop my trunk on any nigga that bump
And when I dump these punks gon scat, say slow your roll cause I ain't about to chit-chat
That's a fact and I'll let it be known, respect my mind you standing in my zone
Southside Texas that's where I roam, and I'm thoed in the mind and gone in my zone

[Den Den]
Move up the sound, on my automatic cannon
Muscle still smoking, nobody's standing
I'm running it, I'll act a fool
If another nigga say, that he selling Screw
Have you ever, seen his face
Or did you cop the style, off a Screw Tape
Duct tape, me a bootlegger
Had him on his knees, plea barging and begging
Save your nuts, cause I don't give a damn
True blue soldier, that's what I am
These other niggaz, belong in a dump
'Fore I let em face the click, pull a pump
Jump, but don't get it criss-crossed
We said it in deep, trying to fliss-floss
We slow and low, and we six deep
Day, Screw slowing down the tempo

[Hook - 4x]

[Buddah Man]
S.U.C. is who we are, coldest nigga you ever saw
We thugged out and that's on the bar, cock back ready for war
Got fans drawing like Billy the Kid, haters plotting I'll split your wig
Listen just for a nigga to dig, I'm iced up my feel is big
This game real but boys none, won't stop till my job's done
Ain't no fun we packing guns, sitting heavy bout two tons
I'm one of the ones like P-A-T, off with your head if you fuck with me
Hauling niggaz off ain't nothing to me, cause ain't nan nigga got love for me
You niggaz act like you ain't got enough of me, my lifestyle been rough for me
But luckily I live luxury, I shake FED's without even touching me 
You can't fuck with this nigga done told you twice, verbal attack ain't nothing nice
Get a grip on that ass just like a vice, you roll the dice you pay the price

[T-Pop]
These niggaz already know, that it's Southsi' for li'
4:30 in the morning, and I'm still block bleeding
With my hand on my heater, just in case a nigga slipping
Pick him off at night time, with my 20/20 vision
They got a cracker saying, that I'm a rat now
Friends turn to foes, now you scared now
Hiding behind love, but that won't save ya
Laf-Tex South, suppose to meet ya
But bitch I'm all in, coward I'm all in
Do what I wanna do, and ain't no falling
Ain't no stalling, ain't no snitch in my blood
I done found out your bitch ass, trying to be a thug
Get filled with slugs, cause I don't play no games
Peruvian flakes nigga, I'm uncut cocaine
I put you to shame, anytime you step to the plate
And that knows that the Juggler bitch, is far from fake

[Mike D]
I don't know what make em think, that can hang with us
Never seen em in the hood, with a grain of dust
But they swear to God, they came up with us
Where my real mo'fuckers, get them thang-thangs up
I been serving blocks to the streets, since 9-3
And serving dicks to these bops, till they ass can't see
Should of named my lil' daughter, I-Tina for the moves I made
On I-10 blending in, getting them dividends
Y'all know me, it's the Hogg Corleone
Mobbing with my lil' bro, T-Pop Kapone 
Laf-Tex/C.F.E., we got a game plan now
They can't fade now, watch the K spray now
I'm like Luda, move get out the way
Lay it the fuck down, I'm about the gun play
And I represent, from the Tre to Vesay
Corleone's back, and I'm having it my way come on
