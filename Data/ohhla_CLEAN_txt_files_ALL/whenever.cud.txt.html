[KiD CuDi]
Focus baby don't look at me
See right through me
Understand my heartbeat
Murmurs to mock your rhythm
Yeah, my nuts, the other girls want 'em
But they can't have
At least for the moment
I'm with you there could be people around
I'm just focused on you
You can sip chardonnay and I'mma have myself a brew
I'm a country ass nigga baby
You know how I roll
Your face, never seen something more perfect
You dance in my mind like justice
I know you listening back like damn, bro!
Laid back so gentle like the violins
Lay on the beat and we don't have to be discreet
Can I have a taste? Absolutely!
Your my sweet tangerine lets make a smoothie
But baby all jokes aside
My heart beats faster when you open your thighs
I'm just ready slide ride and glide

Whenever baby, whenever baby, whenever baby
However, whenever, however, you want me girl you got me (wooh hoo hoo, wooh hoo hoo)
Whenever, however, you want me boo, it's me and you babe me and you
Whenever, however, you want me girl you got me (wooh hoo hoo, wooh hoo hoo)
Whenever, however, you want me boo it's me and you babe, me and you
Whenever, however, you want me girl you got me (wooh hoo hoo, wooh hoo hoo)
Whenever, however, you want me boo it's me and you babe, me and you
Whenever, however, you want me girl you got me (wooh hoo hoo)
Whenever, however, you want me boo it's me and you babe, me and you</pre>
