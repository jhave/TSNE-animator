[Chorus 2]
You know how we do it (on the regular)

[Verse 2]

And you won't ever see me buyin' nothin' thats regular
Hey, I fell in love wit'cha look
The way them lips move when ya talk got me hooked
Hey, I can take ya to the top of the world
Have ya body draped in diamonds and pearls, make ya my girl
Come on, so we keep it on the hush
Can't fight the lust I gotta touch
Hey, so if you really wanna roll
Hop in, wit' a playa let's go

[Chorus 2]
