[Verse 1:]
I wake up to you
Go to sleep to you
And all in between
I'm hearing you
I like to ride to you
I think to you
And it's something I love
I sing to you

[Chorus:]
I'm crazy about you
Oh yeah
I can't live without you
No [repeat]
I'm so glad I got you
Right by my side
Yeah [repeat]
Cause I'm lost without you

[Verse 2:]
I laugh [x2] to you
I cry to you
And when there's no one else to talk to
There's always you
I dance to you
Share romance to you
Millions of people who know me
They see you
Oh woah [x2]

[Chorus:]
I'm crazy about you
Oh yeah
I can't live without you
No [repeat]
I'm so glad I got you
Cause I'm lost without you

[Bridge:]
Your everywhere
In the past it's been said
That you make the world go round
Round and round
So I guess that's what I'm tryn to say now
Aye hey

[Chorus:]
I'm crazy about you
I'm crazy crazy about you
I can't live no ooh
I can't live without you
Your the reason I breath hey yeah
I'm so glad I got you
Cause I'm lost without you I'm so lost
Cause I'm lost without you
I'm crazy about you
I can't live without
So glad I got you
Cause I'm lost...</pre>
