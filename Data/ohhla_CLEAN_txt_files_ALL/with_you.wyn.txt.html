[Lil Wayne]
Uh, shawty badder than a three year old
Keep playing and I'm a eat her like a pita roll
I'm just saying, with my love, I can feed her soul
Two day getaway and we don't need our clothes
We at the pool and she looking like a centerfold
Two tattoos, but she say she's getting plenty mo'
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me, and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her Rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Marlowe, get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Marlowe, get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear, then lick around her lobe
And when she check her watch, it's never time to go
And with her brain, she should make the honor roll
And when I came, she caught me like the common cold

Bridge [Lil Wayne]:
D-D-Damn, you're the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle the shit
But tonight, it's moonlight and candles and shit

Chorus [Drake]:
With you baby (repeat four times)
With you and only you [Drake harmonizing]

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, I say, damn I must be there
Because you're the best that I ever seen right
Shawty put me on, you got me gone like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right
Then they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing riiice
Let's get together overnight
shawty I'm a pro and you were looking like the prototype [Laughs]
Macita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice, then shake it up and roll the dice
I'm cruising on the road to life but I need a passenger
Appetite for love and ma, I'm hungry like a scavenger
I-I be on that lavender, I-I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner

Bridge [Lil Wayne]:
D-D-Damn, you're the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle the shit
But tonight, it's moonlight and candles and shit

Chorus [Drake]:
With you baby (repeat four times)
With you and only you [Drake harmonizing]

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, now she don't know about me, but I'm a put her on it
And she ain't sure about me, but can't go without me [Laughs]
We probably ain't supposed to be together
but I wonder if a love affair could last forever? [Laughs]
And shawty, I'm weak, smoke a lot of weed but I can never forget ya
And then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place

Bridge [Lil Wayne]:
D-D-Damn, you're the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle the shit
But tonight, it's moonlight and candles and shit

Chorus [Drake]:
With you baby (repeat four times)
With you and only you [Drake harmonizing]

Bridge [Lil Wayne]:
D-D-Damn, you're the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle the shit
But tonight [But tonight echoes in the background]

Chorus [Drake]:
With you baby (repeat four times)
With you and only you [Drake harmonizing]</pre>
