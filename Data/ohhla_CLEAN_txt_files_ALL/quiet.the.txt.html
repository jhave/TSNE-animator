*imitating "Scarface"* 

"Hey hey, we about to take shit over, right Tony? (yeah)
You hear me? I'm talkin big money, big money (uh-huh, Quiet Money y'all)
We gonna take this over, let's slurp this spaghetti (where the crew at)
Hey hey (where y'all at)"

Chorus [AZ] 2x
Blood money, thug money, drug money
Slug money, run wit me or run from me
Gun money, sixteen in one money
&gt;From the streets, these raps and beats become money

[Halfamil]
Bitches say I'm spoiled
I ain't tryin to ball, got no time at all
Push the Hummer, spend a G on Amaral
&gt;From Tennesse to Harlem World dunn-dunn
I'm tryin to cop a planet so I could start a world wit thugs
They write books on how we used to roam the streets bug
Holdin chrome and eat blood
You'll find a chromosome on each slug
(Slow down dunn, you're killin em)
Fuck that, tell them niggas keep up
Matta fact, I'ma speed up
We came a long way from free lunch
Stashin mack's in the tree trunks
Crashin Ac's and hazardous acts, ghetto bastard
Pos-ses a mack, alligator hats
Cheese E-A, swallowed jewels
Me and A, molecules like DNA
I'ma cruise to the island, we'll be ?eyein' lay?
Quiet Money, finest way, meet me on a Bahama Bay
White sand, my dunn shine like Ice Man
In a hovercraft, poppin bubbly in the bubblebath
Bitches blowin, ?subject? they ass, thugs'll cash
Quiet Money, run for your gats (what)

Chorus 1x *substitute "gun money" w/ "dunn money"*

[AZ]
Some got a lot of jail, fresh just comin outta they shells
Spark a L, let me school y'all how to properly swell
Lay it back, but seein these fool and spray they gat
Rock a vest, flip cuz he stressed, I ain't amazed wit that
Advancements, stay play the game, just enhanced it
Obey a nigga T-P-A, view my transcript
How rich can I be, speak highly of niggas beatin bodies
Never try me, trey-pound cop beside me
Rockin Wallees, my whole dab watch them wisely
Pops surprise me, raised me high off the Isley's
Mercilfulless, circle the six, David Berkowitz
Let the clip spit then murk in the mist
Gun in my fist, nearly popped one in my bitch
Check this, on some Donald Goines death wish shit
Necklace thick, never disrespect this click
Had a Lexus early '96, switched the shit
Peep the Q whip, know how these streets do men
Three to nine, ?assist the gate or do rhyme?
He got two in, from rich to ruin
Some cats'll snitch they crew in
Fresh money got the smell of perfume, we tryin to move in

Chorus 2x

[Animal]
It's the Animal, you recognize the voice, who this is
Cotton in the mouth, duct tape around the kids
Fuck Versace, livin the life of Liberace
Shorties try to copy, be pumpin bombs in the building lobby
Bad turns, spread the beef like germs
Motherfuckers never learn till you crawlin wit worms
When it's time to kick ass, I got the steel-toe boot out
Break the loot out, I bring grenades to a shoot out
Plus your ones up, you should never put your guns up
Shit, niggas waitin in the cut for you to fuck up
Press your luck up, you fuck around and get stuck up
I trick a hundred, drinkin biz and gettin blunted
I'm just like AIDS kid, don't none of y'all cats want it
If so, I'm stealin on you like a thief
Like a vegetarian, you don't want no beef
Go against all odds, fuck the baddest broads
Run a hundred yards, I'm even down wit the Beast Gods
Shit is real in the field guard your grill
Like Steven Segal, me and dogs Hard To Kill
You ain't never seen niggas more cold-blooded
The jewels flooded, let's get the ones we could cut it
Shit I say split it, if shorty wanna fuck then I be wit it
She don't suck dick, then forget it
So I'ma grant you to make a wish like a genie
Niggas disappearin off the ave like Houdini
Y'all niggas fools, y'all play the game by the rules
We pack tools, stickin niggas for the jewels
Uh, what

Chorus 2x

[AZ]
Uh, what what AZ now
Uh, Quiet Money y'all
Uh, what yo yo</pre>
