(verse 1)
Divided we stand man decides to unite for bandwagon
Antagonistic fashion statements pants saggin grand dragons
Street tagging advertisers, plastic liars, bar codes
Stuff your wallets fat, misspell your cotton pharm clothes
Scared with shopping carts marks
March with the other army ants
Be aardvarks for forty hours thought, hardly a chance
How long can we dance, upon our hands for these snakes?
Dreams capes and screen savers fate baits police states
Increasing release rates complicating everything
But honestly, faking philosophies talk to me, never think
Play level as treble rings, mellow strings and boom bap
Embellishing fiends with tight lids on feathery sheets like do rags
Loop that, the news cast, plastic laugh factory
Tap the screw cap masterpiece snatch the latch and key
Father testin me inventing recipes to wreck survival
The truth we speak, usually two deep, like 5-O
Curse the ears to sneer wisdom but embrace intelligence
We count sheep on your beef but sheer skills to chill irrelevance
We're wasting time, if you ain't making rhymes tight
Hindsight's 20/20 but he's chasin' lime light
Yo, we define height while blind mice just squeak they climb nice
These cats will kill the lie and hype
Tight despite your prize heisters
Blistering heat and listening honestly skip the bullshit
Drop sloppily from seat bottom brought sodomy to the school kids
The ?? gets hot as ice ?? despite his life to prove it
The mic's the fruit of life ?? ?? but likes the music
Insight the use of views produce the news and took a joint pollute it blues
Infomercials, tie your shoes, you probably missed the point
Make the children steal fruit so they can swat the lead flies
Make the children steal fruit so they can swat the lead flies
Make the children steal fruit so they can swat the lead flies
Make the children steal fruit so they can swat the lead flies</pre>
