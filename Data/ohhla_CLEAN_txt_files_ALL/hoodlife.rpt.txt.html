[Kurupt]
I'm more than intelligent, I'm more like irrelevant
I ain't nothin' that you see
It's just you and me and the street
It's just him and her and the heat
I don't need to watch the clock
I'm a ox, I'm Hussein, pure butane
I'm theory, I'm clearly scientific
It's just another cool night in Los Angeles
Might as well go by the hood and just ride
I don't know how it is on yo' side (yo' side)
I used to get high, ride, when we drive by
Ridin' high as a high rise
Clip my syndrome, nickels pierce the sky
Fly and territorial, all hood breed, what we need
Look, nothin' but G's and a stolen Caprice
Just a little bit of hood in your life
Just a little bit of smoke'll get it right

[Chorus: Kurupt] - X 2
Just a little bit of hood in your life (ride by)
Just a little bit of smoke'll get it right (let's ride)
Let me show you what we doin' back home (back home)
From the '4s to the Phantoms to the Broughams (let's ride)

[Roscoe]
Young, semi-somatic, with matic fullies
I'm a asshole bully, my afro wooly
Young, black, and strapped
Cause when them guns clack and clap
Weenie niggaz jump up and run track
Run up on a young mack, with a pistol in your back
I'll put you on your back, buried up under the map
My brain in flames, burnin' up under my cap
My gang insane, burners up in all of our 'Llacs
Slap the clip in - snap, click, tap the trigger
And 'pap-pap' a nigga, clap his click and smash and dip
We mix the weed with embalming fluid and hash
But before you pass it, ash the tip you ashy bastard
I'm a classy classic hood monster
Jurassic with gats made by NASA
Yeah, it's Y.A., Young Assassins, we young and mashin'
Quick to run up and dump and blast on they punkasses

[Chorus: Kurupt] - X 2
Just a little bit of hood in your life (ride by)
Just a little bit of smoke'll get it right (let's ride)
Let me show you what we doin' back home (back home)
From the '4s to the Phantom's to the Brougham's (let's ride)</pre>
