[Redman]
It goes one for the mind and two for the money
Who dat wit skull tattooes and his nose runny
It's me, that funky MC, the Rrr-ah E
Indubitably, I'm Jersey down to Mitentry
Officer, you're hawkin the, ninety-three Landcruise
When it's real criminals, you should be watchin for
Get off my dick for what you don't got
Plus you probably never licked a shot on your block
Walkin to my car witcha nine out the holster
Put your hands on the steering wheel like ya sposed ta
I cooperate don't give the redneck no hassle
Because too many mistakes be happening to black folk

[Chorus]
I said what the fuck are you lookin 4?
Can't a young man make money anymore?
Hah hah, leave ya butt naked...
I said what the fuck are you lookin 4?
Can't a young man make money anymore?

[Redman]
Aiyyo stash that weed up while me and the cop is riffin
Damn I knew I shoulda got that stash box built-in
But it's alright cause me and my niggaz roll tight
We all think alike, we jump out whoever packin pipe
Don't they know who's the freak from the East?
I get faded like Chong and Cheech without bleach
And started spittin game 'fore these cops start to reach
on these creeps, showin mentality from the streets
Even though we had a half a pound by the seats
My peeps never tweek, we handle shit when there's heat
Since one cop was white the otha was a brotha
I pulled out my tape and front page of the cover
of The Source, told him me and Janet's on tour
Broke it down to who's my boss and who I rap for
Plus them niggaz, EPMD
Put me D, now I'm runnin with the Green Eyed B
A-N-D-I-T, and Def Squad camp
Here's your Def Jam tickets and your autograph
Now haul ass, I got a meetin bout seven
Basically I'm saying bye bye like Guy

[Chorus]

[Redman]
My license, been suspended, for about five years
The system got my ass in the jam
Can't even ride to see my fam in Alabam'
I get petrified everytime I see the man throw the lights on (woop woop)
The mic's on so I stress it
Shit I'm haulin ass before I start undressin
Niggaz on they knees with they hands on the top of the
heads while the Feds crack jokes with the glock in ya
Don't get me wrong I know a lot of cool cops
That'd let me go if I had two glocks and oowops
But, I don't, so, I keeps it, real
The five hundred series with deep dish peels
Quick, my bitch, stash, two clips, between two her tits
before the cops fuck with the Rrr-ah
I'm a nigga of today a nigga of tomorrow, beyotch!

[Chorus]
