Yo, Turn the mic up
I haven't been in here in 5 years
And keep the lights on
We got company

[Nelly talking]
Wooooo
Yeeeah
Uh Uh
Yea
Oook
I don't think they gon' really understand this one right herre man
Not at all, not at all
We got a special guest in the house tonight
Who is that?
But first* Ohhh

[Nelly]
You see though I ain't the one that'll pay for your phone
Way you lookin ma
I might just pay for your home
Right out the ceremony give you the throne
Put you somewhere you know birds cant come

I don't wanna be your man boo
I wanna be the one
To get inside your brain
And give you my last name
I swurr I can change
I put that on er'rything
You aint happy while happy wit me boo
Then gimme the blame
Different color ring for erryday of the week
You can go on and set it up for me n pops to meet
Cuz I'ma ask him for you hand
And show that I'm a man
(What if he say that you cant)
I'ma tell him my plans because

[Break]
Me and u was meant to be as one now
Me and u we gon have sum fun now
Me and u from sun up to sun down
Me and u that's one thing I know for sure

[Hook]

IN MY LIFE

(Ma$e) one man one cat made to win
[Nelly] I heard your hear to change the game again
(Ma$e) Mason Betha heaven sent
[Nelly] No game can change what you represent

(Ma$e)
You cant call me with no money that I never spent
They don't make planes to go where I never went
I aint gotta keep sinning to keep spinnin
I prefer pink dice and peach linen
I teach these women what they in the shirt for
Search yours, find out you really worth more
I change your esteem
You was made for a king
Do he really love you?
He ain't give you a ring
I e-rase the hate
That made you mean
Got you 20 lookin' 50
And you only 18
Then ya slate clean
It's not a fake dream
Bye bye hatas
We off for high hatas


[Hook]
I still love you

I still need you
In my life

I STILL

[Avery Storm]
So girl, tell me is there something I can do to see you
Maybe you can make a lil time for me to meet u
