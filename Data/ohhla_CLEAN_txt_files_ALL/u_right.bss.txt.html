Darkchild 9-9
(They ain't ready for this)
Ja Rule
Uh, Darkchild

[Ja Rule]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, damn
I couldn't think about the next man bangin' you
Hittin' it, empowerin' you the I used to
You make me holla
Your cat top dolla, purr when wet
Worth puttin' diamonds on your collar
We down, hittin' switches like a 6-4, follow
Me and you against the world, baby girl (oh oh oh)
But you broken
Now she got your side of the bed, your 6
With wide-screen TVs, in the head
You like the living dead cuz you won't be back
The cat you thought was on, throwin' you off-track (oh oh oh)
Can't do that, love's like a tug-a-war match
You can't win, you fall in, get too attached
You wanna be where I'm at, feelin' me
Without climax, nails diggin' in my back, head board outta wack
What you love about Ja, is what caught your eye
Painful lies and sweet goodbyes, baby why?

         [So Plush]
1 -     Damn, I should've never let you walk right out of my life
         I should've treated you right
         I should've been by your side
         
         But damn, I slept and let you catch somebody's eye
         Now I can't even lie
         It's killin' me inside

I fell in love with you, see, like they do in movies
You were the generous type
You brought me things I didn't need
Promised to take care of me
But then I pushed you to leave, yeah yeah

Money don't make the man, I understand, 
since I let you go (oh oh oh oh) 
But I could've had damn near everything, yeah yeah
Ya see I should've changed my plans
Let ya be my man just for your doe (oh oh oh oh)
And never ever have to explain

Repeat 1

It's wrong for me to think this
But I could have handled it
Me playin' you for a fool
Frontin', so romantic
Just to get my wishes granted
I should've did what I had to do, oh

Now when I think it through, 
I could've been to you a real good girl (oh oh oh oh)
It didn't mean that this is your world, yeah yeah yeah
To satisfy all my needs, 
I could've pleased you a little bit more (oh oh oh oh)
Should've been, could've been, would've been
But these thoughts I just ignored, oh

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

You don't even wanna talk to me, you don't wanna be with me anymore
You don't even wanna call at all, but ya come around tryin' to hit me off
You don't wanna go out with me, I can't stand to see you outta line
But it's really killing me, you're not feeling me
I wish you were mine, but..

Repeat 1 to fade
