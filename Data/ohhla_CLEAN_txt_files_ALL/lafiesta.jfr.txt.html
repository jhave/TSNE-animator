    Everybody in the back now (whoot, whoot)
    Everybody on the side now (whoot, whoot)
    La fiesta (whoot, whoot)
    All the ladies in da house now (whoot, whoot)
    All the fellas in da house now (whoot, whoot)
    Everybody in the house now (whoot, whoot)
    La fiesta (whoot, whoot)

If I approach you correctly
And step up to you respectfully
Will you please ma'am bless me with the next dance?
I don't intend to offend you
I only intend to befriend you
But you're willing me, thrilling me, killing me
With those hot pants, not a chance
I'mma let you go without saying something
A little hotter in the bottom mama that's all that I'm wanting
No frontin' if it is illegal for you to be that fine
I be McGruff mama taking a bite out of crime
Literally, first it'll be dancing with me
Then it'll be dinner with me
Then it'll be back to my crib
Hold up, I'm about to get ahead of myself
And I'm playing myself
The type of brother that when I'm thinking of stuff
I'm saying the stuff
My bad, back it up let's start with a dance
On good behavior, maybe later
Maybe your apartment, your pad
Sike, joke, walking a tight rope
My foot in my mouth
Look, all I hope is that you'll dance with me
What's up?

Repeat 1

She was smiling I was kind wiling
Thinking I was dialin' in
She gave me the impression that she was getting my message
So I'm testing
I through it out there Let me buy you a drink'
Cause when I buy you I think it'd be fly if we link
What'cha think?
She responded with a grin and a glance
Then my eyes tried to seduce her to the forbidden dance
The body of a Latin goddess, sexy but modest
The hottest mami chula from Cuba, a cutie with promise
The other night I seen her dancing
Duty was over
She did a split into a spin
And put her leg on his shoulder
And he was over
If that was me and I was he
We'd probably still be dancing
Mami can you feel me?
Still she said nothing
Why she be fronting?
Never seen another mami move like you
Groove like you
I'm saying I wanna dance with you
What's up?

Repeat 1

To me when I'm dancing it's aphrodisiatic
It's automatic that I look in your eyes to help fantasize
Some people dance socially not emotionally
Closer to me, come on close as you can be
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama cut me no slack
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama forward and back
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama as hard as you can
It's part of the plan
It happens when you start with the man
On your mark, ready set, baby let's go
Baby let's flow, baby let go
Baby no, no, gotta a lot more
Lettin' it rip, gimme some of that
*girl yells*
Yeah that's it
Sweatin' with me, getting it wetter with me
It's better with me
Gain it, other girls I dated ain't famous
So take it or leave it
Just the way that I eat it
I bring, I swing it
So you like that?
Tell me what's up

Repeat 1 till end</pre>
