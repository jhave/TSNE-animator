Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I've been waiting so long
To get into her view by my side, to tell you I love you
I can't do no wrong when you are an angel
With you by my side, you are my euphoria

Euphoria...

And when you look in my eyes the pain goes away, euphoria
You feel so damn good, I want you to know that
Just come take my hand closer
We could go to the moon
Look in my eyes as we lay, euphoria

Euphoria...

Now when you lay in my arms the pain goes away, euphoria

Euphoria...

And when you're mine, I won't let you go
The pain, it can stay, like euphoria

Euphoria...</pre>
