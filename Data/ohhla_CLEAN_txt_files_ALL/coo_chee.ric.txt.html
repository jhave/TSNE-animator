Come here, lil mama come here
There oughta be a law the way you walk in them pants
Comin up in here half dressed, where ya clothes at
What your name and where you get them pretty toes at
She barely good but good with curse words
Spend all my money up, smoke all my herbs
Crash the coupe, make her count that too
No matter what ya do you're still my boo
She run the streets more than I do, boo the doo
Can't talk to ya cause she keep an attitude
Hid the stash, hit the cash, ain't ask to borrow
Lookin at it ain't a loss I'll make it up tomorrow
Holla-in at my man sayin I'll see y'all tomorrow

Turn down my ones and none and then some
Haters here they come but shes a chicken on the run

Something that ya give to 'em can't take it

So everytime I hit it I'm like oh yeah (ooo, ooo)
Daddys little girl tryna show some public hair (yeah)
Tryna get me upstairs yeah thats cool (yeah)

So listen up fellas what I'm tellin y'all
How time flies when you're havin fun
But whose havin fun with a chicken on the run

Brown, put up a candle ha yellow vanilla
Chocolate milk is all tellin them apart
They look the same when they layin in the dark
She aight as long as she's playin your part
Rough sex while I pull your hair
Lookin up ankle bracelet in the air
Layin the rick a majigum sex matism (girl)
I chose to freak 'em and stick 'em rather than lick em
Ooh little mama over there with that toe ring
Roll it in cocaine and hide it in propane
Niggaz intimidate, why because shes wrapped up
Play that, touch her the wrong way and get slapped up
A yo yo holla ova hear me {hey)
And lemme know if ya feel me {hey)
To all the ladies who fat and skinny..
Hell short or tall ah hell I love all y'all
