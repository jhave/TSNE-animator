[Mos Def]
Have fun y'all
Have fun y'all

The city breathing all down your neck
Bad news and good dough special effects
And reality's teeth
Bright, black, sicker than deep
Who ain't shy of the pain?
Who ain't shy of the pleasure just the same?
Life is a game I heard the homie say
Well I came to win so I'm not here to play

Have fun (Get it, get it)

Don't stop
Ecstatic
Fantastic
Wild
People

Bad news and good dough
Powder, potion, pills, smoke
Baby, how you trying to go?
Duro o dulce, fast or slow?
Yay, no?
It's OK you can have it your way love
It ain't all good but baby I'm cool
Feeling great, feeling good how are you?

10% Condition, 90% response
Survival mathematics the number mad song
Old dads drop the jewels so pure
When the times get raw, there's something I recall
Sometimes I don't remember it at all
And it gets stormed by the weather with no umbrella
Sky release pressure and the ground get wetter
My outfit f'd up 
Could'a looked fresher
But guess what?
The hell with parade day rain
Tsunami and sunshine a vomit is the same
Life is a game I heard the homie say
Well I came to win
Dante

Get it get it
Bey!
Get it get it
Brooklyn
Get it get it

Don't Stop
E'day

Bad news and good dough
Powder, potion, pills, smoke
Baby, how you trying to go?
Duro o dulce, fast or slow?
Yay, no?
It's OK you can have it your way love
Nasty times, but baby I'm cool
Feeling great, feeling good

Ey'day
Every day
Having a good time
Every day
Having a good time
Every day

Bey!

Having a good time every day

That's cool...</pre>
