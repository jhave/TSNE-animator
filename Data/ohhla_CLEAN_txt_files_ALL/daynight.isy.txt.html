[Jadakiss talking]
That's right, Isy', Jadakiss, ya heard?
Let's get it on

[Verse 1]
You got a house on the hill, chromed out ride
You live that life, giving me everything that I dream
All the time on a creep, first class flights
Seas in sights, all night
Never thought that this could take control of me

[Chorus]
Day and night, I owe it to you
Always on my mind and dreaming of you
It feels so right but I know it is wrong
That I know I gotta man, just can't leave him alone

[Verse 2]
So many nights on the scene
Buying me, shopping sprees, diamond rings
All the things that I can't get at home
Never could understand a thing like me
To utter this from the seen of your face
I'm caught up in love with my secret love

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Never thought that I would feel this way
All the things that I believed in went away
Right from the start, you took my heart
I'm in love, what can I say

[Jadakiss]
Uh uh uh uh uh, hey yo
You just can't leave me, see me alone
The Porshe is black the B's is chrome
And he's at home and you with me
It's the four point six, three cribs and some jewelry
Don't work I can put you through school for free
So if that's cool with you it's cool with me
Princess ya neck, tennis ya wrist
Anything you wish, Icey and Kiss
Thinkin' of me so what ya really got him for
Let's go to the mall and close down the Prada store
And even if ya don't rock diamonds
Baby you'll like to go deep-sea fishin' and rock climbin'
Pop wine and horseback ridin'
You shotgun scared, use the Porshe back slidin'
And ya friends say J ain't right
But you know we go together like day and night, uh

[Chorus with variations to end]</pre>
