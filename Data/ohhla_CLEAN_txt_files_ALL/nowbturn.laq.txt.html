Here we go

Everybody rise up
(Now is the B Turn)
People checkin out the time
(Get ready, get ready)
Everybody

[ VERSE 1: Laquan ]
Third eye shines like a force of light
Tongue used as a tool to provide a Godly light
Most are lost and blinded by vanity
Africa's home and the birth of humanity
How could a nation grow without its roots
For the land is the tree and we're the fruit
Awareness of black pride is kept aside
It's time the mentally dead revise alive
Pyramids prove we were first in existence
Change our conditions and rise with persistance
Position is fightening, words are enlightening
For those who can't see the light of G-o-d
Black is a state of mind, it's more than a skin color
The skin color doesn't make you a true brother
It's been said, return of the dead will take place
For that time is now cause now is the B Turn

[ CHORUS ]
Everybody rise up
(Now is the B Turn)
People checkin out the time
(Get ready, get ready)
Everybody rise up
Everybody

[ VERSE 2: Laquan ]
Build up, set the field up, truth is vital
A false statement's never made my recital
Raise your vibrations and raise the vibrations of others
In God's sight we're all brothers
Pyramids to projects, subject to death
State of mind and your brother is all we have left
Grow into new growth or let your soul float
In the fire of a false desire
Mind is important, flesh is a vehicle
God is most powerful, man is a miracle
Under the prayer that was spoken by Moses
How do I know this? The Bible has told us
Watch the books you read cause some books deceive
An evil writer may attempt to mislead
The sand of my homeland is what created man
Seek knowledge and learn
For now it's the B Turn

[ CHORUS ]
Everybody rise up
(Now is the B Turn)
People checkin out the time
(Get ready, get ready)
Everybody rise up
(You been waitin for the B Turn)
Everybody

(Here we go)

[ VERSE 3: Laquan ]
I am God's child, called unto destiny
For He has blessed me though some think less of me
God is within you, so let your heart guide
God in the sky? That's all a big lie
Freedom is not free, so how can I be free?
Smoke screen clouds your eyes so you can't see
Babylon has fallen, our time has come
From the womb to the tomb as the young begin to bloom
Some pump their fist and pose to be down with this
Tackle the untruth, regroup and teach the youth
Man can kill as well as heal
As I wake the blind with words of steel
Brothers and sisters, rise and become (try)
Become number one (cope)
Seek knowledge and learn (hope)
Now's the B Turn

[ CHORUS repeated w/variations until fade ]
Everybody rise up
(Now is the B Turn)
People checkin out the time
(You been waitin for the B Turn)
Everybody rise up
(Now is the B Turn)
Everybody
(You been waitin for the B Turn)</pre>
