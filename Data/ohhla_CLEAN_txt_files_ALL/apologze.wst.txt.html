[Verse 1]
There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wouldn't vibe
No I seen her inner eyes
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, nah fuck it I didn't lie
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by
She had a lil weed and we get a lil high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe
Boo back in 92' I was just like you
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel

[Chorus](2X)
We ball 'til we fall
Hit the mall
After we
Hit don't call
We fill your lives
With nothing but lies
And I would like to
Apologize

But you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be alright
'Cause until the day a real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise

[Verse 2]
Was it something I did wrong?
Yeah I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though, man that hurt yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges
Never had money so I feel like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Trying to see can I afford Canaries
with a Ferrari, and a dinner date with Halle Berry?
When from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week
No I'm trying to call..one ring...two rings...seven rings...eight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she in school and she don't stay here no more
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys
And focus on school full-time to improvise

[Chorus]

No no, you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise (3X)</pre>
