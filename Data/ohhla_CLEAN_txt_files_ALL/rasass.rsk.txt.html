What, yeah yeah
1-9-9-9, the "Waterproof" nigga  
Y'all little faggot ass niggas, you always gotta fuckin' comment
Y'all like little bitches
I'ma pull your skirt up, fo' sho

You ain't got enough calcium to have a bone to pick wit' me
Like a gracie I choke a nigga out wit' his own gi
on me, fuck they whole batallion
I'll chop ya head off and wear ya skull like sophmore medallions, papi
I'm the one wit da million dolla' smile and three dollars to my name
puttin black eyes in the game like mascara
Diabetic MC's must think shit is sweet
these venomous techniques, I leave heat
A nigga gots to have it in these streets
Bubble eyed G-S on they teams wit beats
Screamin, "I'll make ya famous,"
Write my rhymes in alien and battle niggas in sign language
Cowards make a little cheese then enlarge
artificially, like Pamela Anderson Lee's double D's, please
I'm bangin from Belize to Tel Aviv on the Red Sea
Racin' Saddam Hussein on Kawasaki jet ski's

[chorus]
Walk holdin' my nuts, I don't give a fuck
Spit some shit so nasty it'll make Lil' Kim blush
Nigga, rasasanation's the name
I'ma put it on a bullet, and put it in ya brain
See that's wussup, only I don't give a fuck
Spit some shit so nasty it'll make lil' Kim blush
Nigga, rasasanation is the name
I'ma put it on a bullet, and put it in ya brain

[Ras Kass]
Stay pussy as a pantha, puffin' a hav-a-tampa
askin rappers, "What do you call a million rabbits
walkin' backwards?" (backround) A recedin' hairline
You shouldn't be nervous though, cuz if I blow
I'ma buy ya record contrac, neva shoot a video
but realy though, is ya nice without rent-a-cars and hype? (nope)
While me and my 12 homies, sip wine like Jesus Christ
wit' super models bitin' on my ears like Mike Tyson on
fight night (Sho' ya right)
The dumb and dumber, my cats pack thunder, 
and I got mo' wraps than Mumra, mean green 
like that super hero with the lantern and ring, 
then watch bootleg cable on a 60 inch screen
Champagne, greens, in 3d, while bastards out catchin' V.D.'s
See me easily givin' fools the finger like E.T.
we be rougher than callous (y'all faggots)
Sing a love ballad, then toss each other's salad

[chorus]

[Ras Kass]
Now welcome to the terrordome (fuckin maricones)
Hoes in the ozone, cell phones and clones it's on
Busta Rhymes said, "There's only 2 years left"
So nowadays I'm playin' russian roulette wit' a tech (ha)
Ghetto holocaust survivor, everyday,
From the S.S stormtroopin P.D. in L.A.
Tellin me bein' black on Saturday night is a felony
If ya name ain't Michael Jordan or
Bill Bellamy, you ass out (mash out)
Cause a lot of white people is racist that's why I'm
bustin' nuts in their teenage daughters faces, Homie
Cuz when it rains it pours, Got me wearin a six foot
condom, screamin' "FUCK DA WORLD"
Makin' butterfly-ass niggas commit insecticide
Half god - 50% zilla - illa - my alphabet slitha across
ouiji boards from the philla-gilla, 
have dead niggas dancin around they graves like Thriller

[chorus]

[Ras Kass]
Yeah, what, the "Waterproof", Stu'B'Doo on the track
Rhettmatic Beat Junkies on the scratch
Listen, all y'all niggas be having too much to say man, 
y'all niggas can eat a fat big dick
If you're pissed off you dying with your dick in your hand, guaranteed 
All y'all bitch ass niggas 
trying to play me on the Liberaci Versace tip
I'ma catch you outside your mansion with a big four fifth
