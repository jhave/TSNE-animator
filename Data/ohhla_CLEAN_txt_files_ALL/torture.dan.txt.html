[Verse 1]
Remember one time, dawg
This fiend owed the boss
Put Peanut Butter on her pussy
Let his pits lick it off
Back when I was living on Flanders
Seen another dope fiend beat another with a hammer
Remember at the park, seen a nigga at a payphone.
Got rocked in his dome
Momma picked me up and ran home
Was like fucking seven years old
When I first seen a fiend try to light a rock off the stove
Damn near burned his top lip off
So my mind ticked off
Desensitized to a lotta things
Mind would drift off
Wish it was what I seen on tv
I snapped outta that
Unc beating on my auntie.
Gunshots outside
Was sorta like fireworks
We know they gained fireworks
It's december 21'st
Cold winter with a kerosene heater
On the couch so cold, can't take off your sneakers

[Chorus]
And it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen
Nigga, it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen
Nigga, it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrorss
All the shit that I've seen

[Verse 2]
I feel like a prisoner of war
Reacting sporadically to what the mind absorb
Probably need a shrink
Can't get a wink
So I smoke a lot of kush and pop a Xanax to sleep
Close my eyes, look up, fiend said 1 for 8
Can tell that I scared him by the look on my face
Reached in my pocket served him nervous as a surgeon
Can't believe where I'm at 'pose be writin' verses
Heard a knock at the do'
'Nother fiend wanted fo'
Gave him what he came for
Told him go to the sto'
Lemme get a box a box of Swishers, Faygo Cola
Gave his ass another stone now guess what it's over
He ain't come back
Before I could look back
I heard the wood on the door crack
And they yelling police
With this work up in my jeans man this a bad dream

[Chorus]</pre>
