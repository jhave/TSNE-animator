[Slug - Verse 1]
Ain't no colour paint gonna cover the stains
The pictures on the wall will all remain
And even though he's home now, sound and safe
Surrounded by the faces that he place his faith
The images visit from the past he witnessed
Can't stay away from the memories
Sticks with each detail, embedded in stone
Like he chiseled stoves convictions into his bones
The progress stops and pauses, spits and sputters
Like the basement faucet
And it's obvious he's lost in his regrets
You can smell it on his breath

[Slug - Verse 2]
Ain't no colour paint gonna cover the stains 
But now the alcohol is gonna mother the pain 
Tuck it away, no complaints
Just laying on his back, on hisbackyard under the rain 
Take tomorrow but doesn't no how though
For every swallow there's another to follow 
He weaves his way throughout the story 
Looking for a new missing piece or a door key 
Spirits used to be for celebration 
But now they just take him away from the hell that's waiting 
Re-up until it's three sheets up 
And pick a place for the skeletons to meet up 

[Slug - Verse 3]
Ain't no colour paint gonna cover the stains 
But if the oxygen escapes it'll smother the flames 
No introduction doesn't speak his own name 
Gonna beat them demons at they own game 
The sunset rides to the end slow 
Same song echoing outside of the window 
You can't grow if the skin don't fit you 
Sometimes you gotta get low just to get through 
No inspiration left to do your best when
Nobody hates you more than your reflection 
Suffer the shame until it stuffs the drain 
He's got two hands and a bucket of paint
Come on</pre>
