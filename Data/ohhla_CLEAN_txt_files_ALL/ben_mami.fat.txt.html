Typed by: taylor.thompson@caroline.com

Empty Arms and Lonely nights
That's my life without you girl
I'm so lonely I'm so blue
Without you girl my life is through
Maria
This song is dedicated

Maria - Don't you hear me calling
Maria To the most beautiful woman on the planet earth

Maria
That would be my mother Maria Cartegena

[1st Verse]
Ay yo, she's the best sister
One man love her
And if she died her tombstone would read
The world's greatest mother
August nineteenth she birthed me
I came out
Put her through hell but still in all she couldn't help but smile
I resemble my mama to be truthful
And I ain't got to describe her
You know she beautiful
Shit, I always love my mama
Blow holes through a Nigga if he touch my mama
You did whatever it took to keep the supper hot
And I remember when you worked at the number spot
Once the cops caught you I skipped school
Yeah I guess the cops was cool
They let me feed you
I cryed for hours till they finally freed you
Drop to my knees and screamed Mama we need you
Then you went back to school and got a job that's legal
Maria

[Chorus]

Yeah Mami, I love you so much
For this pain, this love, you've been through so much,
And I thank you for everything you done for us
You've been a survivor and we love you so much
I had to dedicate this song to you Mami
I had to tell the world how much  I love you

[2nd Verse]
Ay yo, yo yo
I never forget the night that changed out life
A neighbor was screaming Maria come out side
Something's wrong with your son I think he's getting high
Then you replied not my son he don't be getting high
Then you bathed him and tucked him to sleep
Yeah I knew from that day life wouldn't be sweet
He got in trouble with the law
Then you bailed him out
I got in trouble with the law then you bailed me out
It was one July the fourth
They tried to take me out
Shot me right in front of my mother
By Tracy's house
Now its time to change my life I think Rap's the answer
Same day I got signed you was diagnosed with Cancer
Doctor said it'd be a miracle if you survived
Then you looked in my eyes and said
Joey I don't want to die
I pray to god that he show us a sign
Now its fourteen years later and you still alive
Thank you God

[Chorus]

[3rd Verse]
God I thank you so much
My Mother has so much to see
So much to do
She's had such a painful life
Many nights I argue with you in my prayers but I know you're the boss
You kept her alive for a reason
Mama I'm a ride for you
I swear
Yo, I bet you proud of your son
He's a rap star now
Took you out of them projects and bought you that house
Got you that housekeeper to manicure the grounds
And I bought you that car that breaks the barrier of sound
You take care of Joey and I love you for that
And you raising John John and we love you for that
I guess Lisa was an Angel
God wanted her back
Damn I really miss my sister
Guess she's better where she's at
Mammy I love you
I want the world to know I love you
And every chance I get I'm a kiss you and hug you
Life wasn't easy everyday is a struggle
But like my niggaz from Chi town say
It's all bubbles

[Chorus]

Hoping my real mo'fuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote

It's that shit right here
Took me like ten years to do

You know I cried doing this song
Man, so much pain
Mami you such a good woman
You a classy woman
I know you a private person
You don't want the world to know all your business
But I had to let them know how strong you are
I love you so much

This song is also dedicated to little Maria
One of my best friends on earth
Get your shit together girl I love you too
Juju what's up, you my nephew I love you for life

It's Crack bitch</pre>
