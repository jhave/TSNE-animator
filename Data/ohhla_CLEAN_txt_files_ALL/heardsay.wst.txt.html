Song:   Heard 'Em Say
Typed by: jessejames21in2003@yahoo.com

Uh, yea, uh, yea, uh, yea
 
[Verse 1]
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a Hard-a-way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the governments administer aids
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allah-u Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours 
But these niggaz from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars with seein cop cars 
I guess they want us all behind bars - I know it
 
[Chorus: Kanye West &amp; Adam Levine)
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say..
(Both)
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
(Kanye West) 
But we'll a find a way
(Adam Levine)
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
 
[Verse 2]
They say people in life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gram' keep praying and keep believing
in Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down 
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cause his skin blacker than liquorish now
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now
 
[Chorus]
 
[Adam Levine]
Cause every worthless word we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way</pre>
