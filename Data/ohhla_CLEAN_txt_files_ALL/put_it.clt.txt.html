A slight mishap ya'll ain't gon' like this track
Spits I'm nice with that drip strike ya' back
It's like I'm on a mission now all you punks dissin' Clowd
I'll have you beat down and into it so bad you missin' out
Sittin' down sippin' crown son ya' ass'll get throne off
Listen how these cats sound suddenly so soft
So fuck your critiques and enough what you speakin'
Your dreams sayin' nothin' like you stuck in ya' sleep and
Somethin' is creepin' I think it's catchin' on
Comin' from any type of object next to ya'll
And it's so contagious I ain't Kelly or Isley
Son I'm inside the beast it's the belly where I sleep
With these sick thoughts I might get brains out it
Direction is not needed cuz it's always clouded
When I'm poundin' ya' sound to the floor it just keeps them
Weak emcees who try and make attempts to speak up
Ya' best bet don't say nothin' when ya' listenin'
You scuffle with ya' written shit you bustin' or ya' listenin' son
Get ya' aim right cuz I'm a drain life
For ya'll hatin' on me sayin' I don't spell my name right
in that case I take it easy and just drop 9yne
With this verse read between the lines man the stop signs
Ya' block finds it kind of hard I'm soul killin'
And so willin' to start my projects with no buildings
I don't sound patient no yeast or foundation
I rise like the sun but never found day shift
And clowns hate this these lyrics are proud rapists
Beat you to the concrete you damn brown faces
It's goin' down alot of ya'll raisin' up
Background Cult VI fake cats afraid of us

Son you actin' like you want it then put ya' life on it
Go 'head and risk it yeah that's you in a nice coffin so
You write war get sickened off this tip
To rip all kids to split you all with
Think rocket ships yeah some slip and fall shit
You're parents had 4 daughters I'm stickin' ya' forces shit
Itchin' for more I'm a let the Hyst finish you
i'm backstabbin' but I'm really stickin' knives into you
I get like chemicals and burn type lyricals
The herb type critical your words like pitiful
You murder me I think not you might die tryin'
With those weak plots bad moves and time linin'
It's 9's to ya' mind bitch and Clowd's where you be at
Lookin' down at me like damn I tried to defeat that

Combustin' with flames instinct just look back
At this track like "damn rap's the only thing I'm good at"

Ayo' I'm makin' this sick mind trap I find cats
Gettin' 2 blunt rappin' like regular dime sacks
I'm better than 9 gats knifes and big blades
You listen and didn't know that I get hype this way
Strangled with nightsticks chains and ropes to ya' neck
Ya'll ain't try'na survive if you hope for the best
Put ya' chokin' to rest man I'm focused to death
I'm like smoke in ya' breath when I open ya' chest
I been over the best niggaz always below
With this track underground it's makin' the streets glow
Take in the heat blow fire from this fist
With angel dust you still ain't gettin' higher than this shit
I ride with the VI not claimin' the Crips and
It's in my Culture son I must remain this sickenin'
Combustin' with flames instinct just look back
At this track like damn rap's the only thing I'm good at
I would stack bodies up lumberjack niggaz
You should pack shotties up comin' back sicker
When I thunder - cats shiver I ain't never callin' truces
I'd rather double split you and have you fallin' to deuces</pre>
