[DJ Clue] New Beanie Sigel! Freeway!
[Beanie] Don't get scurred
[DJ Clue] Fat shout, Beat Street

[Chorus 1: Beanie]
1, 2 - Sigel comin for you
3, 4 - I'm bout to kick in your door
5, 6 - Man I want those bricks
7, 8 - You gon' give up dat weight
9, 10 - I'll put the glock to ya chin
11, 12 - Man I'll see you in hell

[Verse 1: Beanie]
I handle tools like hammers and wratches
Gats wit metal attachments, how you want it metal or plastic
Disrespect your fam bastard, close your casket
Then I give 'em a can of hold your ashes
Visions of the killer for we rose a passin
True killer, true thug, never show no passion
Hit your rug, hit your ceiling, if I know if you stashin
Wrong, nigga the rug, nigga know who you passin
Fresh year from rammin off the zany's fours and perks
Keep the semi handy jammin you for war or work
Niggas like the border goin bizurk 
On the roof bangin dat swat, lettin off shots and spurts
Dey tryin to trap me in the back of the yard
Man I'm lettin every cat fall hittin from the cap to the sarge
Can't see me back in the yard, two wacks back to the wall
Use the two gat stash pack in the wall
Picture Mac liftin up racks in the yard
I had a block shiftin up knocking off racks by the yard
The dope from dem dudes, smokeless confused, shit
They ain't know if they want a crack or the saw
Switch they life, straight from the pipe to the straw
Coke in they vein, what you want the dope or the cane
I open the game, to sniffin the D, X to the Z
Hot shit from B-Sig consecutively

[Chorus 2: Freeway] 
1, 2 - Freeway's comin for yo' ass
3, 4 - You better watch yo' stash
5, 6 - Have you duckin from dem clips
7, 8 - Fuck it I can't wait

[Verse 2: Freeway]
Y'all niggas crazy think Free won't draw the lev'
Prefer the nine but I got the four four instead
I move dymes who your dyme get your whore in bed
Tell that triflin bitch I want more than head
Free might spark at ya clip take more than bread
Guns and bricks while young bulls hug the block
Dey love the strip, help 'em get chains and watches
Guns and kicks, Freeway my name is priceless, flow is sick,
And remember if you lie on Free
Lie in the lake, while your bitch lies on Free
She ride on the snake and my whip over her key
We ride in the jakes, empty clips hop on Amtrak
Out of the state, broody shit, you and yo man, right outta ya case
Hold dis clip blow your brain right outta ya face
Flow legendary, hotter than Mase
Dude Free never where we outta the case
Roc-A-Fella pop criss til we outta the case
Form the hood nigga Nikes, Delts, and 'Lo Sport
Hood niggas just like me, belted and blow court
Hood chickens just bite me well and blow squad
I was 16, 12,000 wit no job
And I skipped school, gripped a bitch wit no ride
See the crack smoked leave bitch wit no thighs, no tits
Rob hustlers wit no clips, no guns, left niggas wit no chips
And the flow runs like the Mississippi River
And your hoe comes, ya bitch hear me when I whisper
Silence all guns hit 'em fo-fo-fo-fo-for dey hit ya
If we comin for you than nigga we gonna get ya

[Chorus 1]
