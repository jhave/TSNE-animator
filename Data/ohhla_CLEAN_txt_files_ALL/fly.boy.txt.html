[Intro: Soulja Boy]
Life (when I be so)
You know livin life (when I be so high)
(When I be so fly, when I be)
Travellin across the world
(Flyest on the planet Earth)
(The flyest on the planet Earth)
(The flyest on the planet Earth, I'm up in the clouds)
You know it, inspiring, the youth
(I be so fresh to death, I be so fresh to death)
(I be so fresh to death, yeah I'm in the sky)
You know watching dreams come true
(I'm in the sky right now, I'm in the sky right now)
(I'm in the sky right now and I'm not comin down)
Life is, y'know, so amazing y'know
(Most dreams just fade away, grow wings and I fly away)
A lot of different thoughts
(Both spread and I fly away, wings spread and I fly away)

[Soulja Boy]
Man I'm posed with the Polo shirt
G5 so fly with the Polo work

Yeah it's S Beezy my time to shine
Yeah 2010 yeah that's my year

I put it in the bag and I make that sale
Young Soulja TellEm yeah I give them hell
And I'm fly on the sea man where's my shell?
I'm here, young Soulja man I tell 'em that
Back to the wall and I still fight back
Hit the microphone and I spit that crack
I tell my young boys that I got that back
Yeah

[Interlude: Soulja Boy]
You know just livin and, breathin and seein (when I be so)
Just learnin every day (when I be so high)
(When I be so fly, when I be)
Life experiences, love
(Flyest on the planet Earth)
(The flyest on the planet Earth)
(The flyest on the planet Earth, I'm up in the clouds)
You know who do you trust?
(I be so fresh to death, I be so fresh to death)
(I be so fresh to death, yeah I'm in the sky)
You know what do you believe?
(I'm in the sky right now, I'm in the sky right now)
(I'm in the sky right now and I'm not comin down)
Y'know just livin and, thinkin
(Most dreams just fade away, grow wings and I fly away)
Throughout the world
(Both spread and I fly away, wings spread and I fly away)

[Soulja Boy]
Word to the world like a gift like Claus
Put my hand on the bible put a verse to God
Treat a hater like a pistol then I go and erase him
One thing that I know I can face anything
Young Soulja TellEm let my fuckin jewelry bling
See me on the TV screen I'm doin things
If I don't do nuttin I'ma live this life
I'm tellin f'real this not just hype
I'm tellin you I didn't just move that white
I'm tellin you I had it up all night
I'm tellin you everything I spit is real
I'm tellin you man, fuck how you feel
Yah, not weak I'm strong
Young S Beezy like King Kong
Young S Beezy see yo' girl thong
Take yo' girl home and then let yo' girl bone
It's me

[Outro: Soulja Boy]
Livin and seein through my eyes (when I be so...)
Every day, is a different chapter (when I be so high)
(When I be so fly, when I be)
Every day is a different page in my book
I call it life (flyest on the planet Earth)
(The flyest on the planet Earth)
(The flyest on the planet Earth, I'm up in the clouds)
(I be so fresh to death, I be so fresh to death)
Right now I'm to a cloud
(I be so fresh to death, yeah I'm the sky)
Y'know I'm lovin what I do
(I'm in the sky right now, I'm in the sky right now)
(I'm in the sky right now and I'm not comin down)
Amazing, this a dream one good dream
(Most dreams just fade away, grow wings and I fly away)
(Both spread and I fly away, wings spread and I fly away)
Life, Dre, y'know
Just doin my lil' thang</pre>
