[Tyga]
Ahhh~! What if your mother, regretted havin your brother?
Would you forgive her and kiss her and tell her you love her?
Or would you press it? Cause bein the only child
could leave you feelin desperate, in need of attention
Every second, but since you man of the house you never get it
Pops left without a smile but you never miss him
But when you reminiscin, you wished you had a father figure
At least weekends, man pay a visit
Awww forget it~! what about Lil' Jason up in prison?
You think an eight-year-old had bad intentions? (I don't know)
Pullin the trigger, on dad just barely killed him
Just wanted to protect moms from the brutal hittings
But he a kid so it's their word against his
Moms won't even testify scared of husband
So he in for some years, don't even know he did it
But can't regret it now, cause it's too late

[Chorus: Patrick Stump] + (Tyga)
We come to life when first class takes flight
Only sing the lines that make you press rewind
Even dealing with electric, I think that he regrets it now
Heart in light, dying love, everything looks better from above
You say it's getting old but I call it vintage love now, now
Don't regret it now
(At a human's price, tryin to live that life)
(Can't slow down) Don't regret it now
(Uh-uh determined by that dice, you only roll twice)
(You broke now) Don't regret it now

[Tyga]
Let's say you and your homey, best friends one and only
Confidant, who I trust, never phony
Just I and the young guy I called my brodie
We was like age of 5 since he known me
But now it's like hazy skies and the mornings
Waking up police say he died hollows pointed
Damn I can't believe you God, why you want him?
I needed him more than you, now what, you lonely?
Just two more months man, we was good money
Now he can't go to awards and meet stars
I'm all alone now ridin in luxury cars
Life like a movie now someone press fast forward
So I can chill with him again and feel real
I'd rather have him here than this rap deal
But he can't regret it now, walkin into that crowd
Had his jewelry on - next thing, man down

[Chorus]

[Patrick Stump]
Work twice as hard to get half as far
Love has legs, feet don't fail me now
Brand new boy, brand new year
Curtains open, I am a grand finale
Did you get my voice mail? Sorry I'm out
having the time of my life
And, I'm gonna do whatever you'd do
if you could be me for one night

[Tyga]
If you could be me for one night (night)
Could you live you're life under lights? (Lights)
Laminates, cameras, ice (ice)
Four A.M. morning flights (flights)
Uh I don't think you can handle that pal
I don't think you can handle this crowd
It's t-too late, can't regret it now
It's t-too late, can't regret it now

[Patrick Stump]
We come to life when first class takes flight
Only sing the lines that make you press rewind
Even dealing with electric, I think that he regrets it now
Heart in light, dying love, everything looks better from above
You say it's getting old but I call it vintage love now
Now

[Chorus]</pre>
