Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
If you believe in having sex say "hell yea" (hell yea)
If you believe in having sex say "hell yea" (hell yea)
If you believe in having sex say "hell yea" (hell yea)
If you believe in having sex say "hell fuck yea" (yes sir)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Shawty throw me that ass, hold up let me see it
Pop it let me touch it, bring it back and let me squeeze it
Go on show me that pussy cat, I'mma take it home and feed it
If it's good as it looks, might go in raw and seed it
Pop a couple of these bands, she poppin' open that G-string
Pussy wet as a pool, and Juicy J's in the deep end
Bands a make her dance, I don't tip till I see pussy
And she ain't got no waist line, that ass as soft as a seat cushion
Damn right I make it rain, all night that's a hurricane
Strip club run out of ones,I'm throwin' twenties I dont need change
Every time she drop it, I'm goin' off to my pocket
Fifty thousand in the air, I ain't worried I got it

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: Trina]
I believe in having sex, bitch I'm Miss America
I do want I wanna do, and I fuck him in my Panamera
Uh yea, fat bitch, don't see no bra, savage
I don't even fuck around 'bout the cabbage
Them hoes just sweet, average
J know the mango Juicy, he love my big go booty
Louboutins bake my cookie, Bugatti bitch no hooptie
If I let you feature my movie, my legs wrapped around my neck
If I let you feature in my movie, somebody cuttin' me a big check
Hoodrich, he got a donkey dick
I'm Auquafina make 'em dive in it
I wanna feel his third leg while he's strokin' it
Throw my face in the pillow while he crankin' it
Oh yea, bend me over take a pic, stroke me good throw me deep dick
Lets put this shit on Instagram, it's Juicy J and Trina bitch

[Chorus]X2

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I dont give a fi-nuck, put in her gin-uts
Hit a strip club, ran out of ones so now I got to re-up
I dont give a fi-nuck, put in her gin-uts
I dont give a, I dont give a, I dont, I dont, I dont, I dont
I dont give a fi-nuck, put in her gin-uts
Hit a strip club, ran out of ones so now I got to re-up
Sex pistol, lady killer, b-b-b-bust a nut on her, and that's baby sittin', (damn)
OK now next contestent, I smoked a blunt for breakfast
Skeeted on her chest, and thats a fuckin' necklace
By the time you get back, I'll be somewhere leave a strokers
With a girl like Pocahontas, with her hair down to her shoulders
Unconditional love, we can do it in a Porsche
From the Porsche to the wall, wall to the sofa
I'm supposed to post her, it's La Cosa Nostra
Then I pull her closer, hit her with the poker
