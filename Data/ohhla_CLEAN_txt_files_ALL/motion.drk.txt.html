Song:   The Motion
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's not me and you
It's not me. It's you
You're reckless and you know it
They don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion

I guess that's just the motion (oooh) [x4]

I don't have a fuck to give
I been moving state to state
In my leather and my Tims
Like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chubb
That's my nigga from the way
On the East side of the city
That's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling
'Cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it
I can never do no wrong
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone

But, I guess that's just the motion
And their phone doesn't ring when they got everything
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (oooh) [x2]

Yeah
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact
'Cause we said no strings attached
And I still got tied up in that
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her
And she know it
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help

But, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh) [x3]

[Sampha]
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
(I guess that's just the motion)
Talking to you's not enough (no ohh)

I guess that's just the motion (ohh)
I guess that's just the motion [x5]</pre>
