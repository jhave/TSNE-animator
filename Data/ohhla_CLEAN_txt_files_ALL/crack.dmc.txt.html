[D.M.C.]
Here's a story of a guy, who used to be fly
He never would steal, he never would lie
The type of person money could not buy
Thought he be that way until the day he DIED!

[Run]
MAAAAAAN, he met this girl, made his head swirl
To him she was worth more than diamonds 'n pearls
But she wasn't like all the other girls
Because she was only out, to crush his world!

[D.M.C.]
He didn't care what his friends, had to say
'Cause he had to see the girl, everyday
He quit his work, his J-O-B
and he gotta lose his touch with his family

[Run]
HEEEEEEE would lie for herrr, cold die for herrr
Did nothing in the world wouldn't try for herrr (yeah)
Get ill for herrr, he'd steal for herrr
There's nothing in the world he wouldn't DEAL for herrr

[D.M.C.]
He sold his car, stole a VCR
So low on dough, he went and robbed a bar
He lost everything, he had nuttin to LOSE
For staying wit this girl, he was paying his dues

[Run]
Well he tried to leave, but the love was strong
He shouldn't have stayed with T'HER so long

[D.M.C.]
Now What's Going On? He sings the sad song
What was right in his life, has now gone wrong
He said, I got to leave, for a day or two
But on the very next day he said, "I need you
I can't live without you, and you know this true
'cause my love for you just grew and grew"
So he took her home, she took him back
They made so much love, he caught a heart attack
She drove him to his grave, that's where he's at
AND THE GIRL THAT KILLED HIM IS A GIRL CALLED CRACK</pre>
