Hi how ya doin? My name is Jack
I have a wife, 2 kids, a dog, and a rat
I tried to kill the son of a bitch this morning
But i couldnt really focus cuz my wifes out whorrin'
I love my kids although there dumber than fuck
Part of the reason is cuz there all drugged up
Lisnin to some fucker on the radio named Shady
I Kinda like the kid i guess that makes me crazy
Anyway the reason that im here is to tell you about something that happened to me the other day
Where I had a guy run up to my Rover
Then He pulled out his gun and told me to scoot over
I seen the real in his eye
So I said will do
He said

" Just Keep Cool and Maybe I Wont Have to Blast You "
Ima ask you one time give me yo shit and give it quick
Or I'll bust both yo lips
You rich people make me sick
With your luxirious Cars, luxirious Clothes and Shoes
But im snatchin that shit
Cuz I aint got shit to lose
So up yo wallet the checkbook and the gold chain
Then strip to yo socks and get the fuck out the Range

What are ya sayin ya fuckin theif
Im helpin you out
How you gonna threatin to kill me and put me out
If you were gonna kill me I dont think u'd be hesitating
Instead your shaking and bullshit conversating
Yeah im a rich mother fucker, got a lot of money
But my wife spends it all gotta work to keep it coming
Payin taxes to support  people like you
No this isnt a black thing ill tell you what i'll do
I'll write you a check just for respect
Cuz you'll never get anything takin other peoples shit
I wont cancel the check I will have it approved
Who do I write this check out "Thugs R Us" or you

Ha Ha you think you funny but im the one with the gat
And if I shake a little more ill lay your white ass flat
Fuck the check we'll go back to my original plan
Since im the one with the bullets I think i'll make the demands

Come on buddy meet me half way
I'll take you to my house will my children are
I'll show you where i stay
We'll go to the basement pull the money outta the floor
Introduce you to my wife and let you fuck the little whore
I'll even make ya famous, wanna know how? (How)
Meet my little friend
(gun shots)
(phone dialing)
Hi operator I just killed this little car jacker
He's bleedin all over my shit

That was the story of The Jack N Tha Jacka
One was the victim the other was the attacka
One carries credit cards the other carry gats
Better investigate before you go fuckin with Jack</pre>
