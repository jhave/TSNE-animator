[M-1]
The white man came to Africa with rifles and Bibles
Heard the name, started changin the titles
Now instead of Chaka call me Nat Turner with the burner
Freedom fighter for this revolution, fuck a wave journer
See I be what John Wilkes Booth was to Lincoln, blam!
Sirhan Sirhan, peepin through the curtains with my eyes on a Kennedy
Dead prez, politic, know your enemy, keep your toast close
Because political power come from the barrel of it
We in a war, nigga leave it or love it
Since they got us in a scope like a P.E. logo
I watch for the po-po (woop woop) and train at the dojo
Not a gun Deniro but a working class hero
Takin a stand, like a panther with an M-1 Guran
Screamin know your gun laws, self defense is a must
When we set it off I'm a be the first to bust

[Stic.Man]
Freedom is not having to sell crack to eat
Freedom is you can say without the bleep
Freedom is power in the hand of the masses
Where everybody shares and there are no classes
Freedom is hard work freedom is ours if we bomb first
Freedom is heaven on earth if you religious religion is your personal
Business freedom is our collected political interest
Love put in the action of principal roles
Freedom is where the people play an active role
In the policies the govern our lives
Freedom is equality fire all black mothers &amp; wives
Freedom is sacrifice freedom is black life without hungry nice
In the ghetto its so simple the most opposite of what we have lived
Freedom is showing love by the efforts you give</pre>
