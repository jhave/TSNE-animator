{phone rings}

[Beavis]
Uh.. hello?
Who?
Damnit, for the last time
There aren't any Mexicans here {hangs up phone}

[Sir Crown]
Ey holmes throw on some fuckin oldies ese

[Lil' Rob]
Orale let me trip on this 45 then ese
Watcha.. ora..

Si mon I'm ready ese, estoy listo
Si out of marijuana say pass to the pistol
Cause I don't need to get drunk off my ass
I just need a little high that's gonna last
Jump off the raffla, kick back on the curb
Light up a toke, yeah smoke up all the herb
Smoke three move to the five then to the seven
Ran out of zig-zags so back to 7-11 we go
No need to buy 'em we'll just leave 'em
Homey said he'd call the police, I didn't believe him
Walked out the store with an attitude
Started capping, then started laughing
Then let me tell you what happened
Went back to the hood rolled up some endow
Putos rollin' through my barrio, I broke their window
Shank their fuckin tires now they can't leave
And now it's about time for three sold guys to bleed
Pulled 'em out the raffla and we fucked them up
Took 'em to the canton and we tagged them up
Put the big "BC" on their foreheads
We want the vatos alive we don't want 'em dead
We want em walking around to show that the Brown Crowd was there
And did that shit without a care
In the world cause they're nothing but little girls
Damn I shoulda pulled it cause they deserved the bullet
Put the cuete to their temple 
Then pulled the fuckin trigger cause it's so fuckin simple

::Chorus::
Just like my lyrics I'm kickin back when I say 'em
I don't yell at putos ey I'm kickin back when I spray them
Fuckin leva

Cause if you fuck with me 
I fuck with you twice as hard LEVA
Yeah, soy chingon

Some vatos walked up and asked if I gangbang
I said I used to
But then I had to pull out the fusca
This vato's from the wrong hood
And now they think they got Lil' Rob good
But fuck it
I had to blast the puto between the eyes
And now I sit here laughing as his homeboy cries
But what the fuck, I did what had to be done
I can't let one go so I have to kill both of them
I don't give a shit, I'll do it real quick
Bust off let's get yes it's time for me to split
It's time to leave the fuckin premises
Cause I don't need a witness 
So I leave with the slickness and quickness
Take homeboy's hyna then pulled the corner
Jumped in the backseat and you know she let me bone her
She's looking fine do you know what I mean
I made her scream
I said stick with me and you'll become a brown queen
Because you never deserved a ranker
You need a vato like me the Mexican Gangster
But what if this firme hyna points the dedo
I'm tellin this sweet stuff pero it's puro pedo
Because you gotta know I'm smarter than that
This hyna wasn't even crying as she saw her vato dying
Now when I'm with her I hear the hura's drive by
Going to the site where I left those fools to die
Now who did it nobody has a clue
And without the murder weapon what's the hura gonna do
Aw shit, what if this bitch pulls rat
So I grab my shotgun and I pump the fucker back
Just in case, but the bitch wasn't knowin
Cause I was still going, had the hyna moaning and groaning
She got nasty, opened her mouth with a grin
Can't let a good thing go to waste
So I stuck my dick in 
And I was goin, she was goin and then I started cumming
Replaced my dick with the shotgun 
And you know I started gunning
In my eyes I didn't do nothing wrong
Do what I do to survive so you know it's on
Y Sabes que no one's ever gonna catch me
Cause I'm too sly, too slick, too W-I-C-K-E-D
Left the place without a trace 
And I didn't care holmes 
So there it is there holmes

::Chorus::

Yeah, and if the payback ain't quick
you best believe the pain is gonna stick LEVA
Soy chingon, soy chingon cabron 
Like Al Capone always holding my own</pre>
