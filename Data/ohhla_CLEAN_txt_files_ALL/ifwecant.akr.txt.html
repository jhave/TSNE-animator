[Intro - Akrobatik]
All my hardcore heads, middle fingers up (uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah)
All my hardcore heads, middle fingers up (what?)

[Bumpy Knuckles]
If we can't build, then you will be destroyed (uh, what?, c'mon, yo)

[Akrobatik]
All my hardcore heads, middle fingers up (one time!)
B-boys in the place (yeah), middle fingers up

[Bumpy Knuckles]
If we can't build, then you will be destroyed (yo, c'mon)

[Verse 1 - Akrobatik]
Bumpy Knucks, Big Ak, yeah we doin it big, pack
The spots, make it hot and never be where the pigs at (uh)
I miss that money, when I don't make it
So if your nose is all up in my biz, I gotta break it (no doubt)
I don't burn bridges and such
But if you fuckin with my business, you gettin fucked up
Broke legs, hurt feelings and dreams deferred
All I gotta do is give my team the word (yeah)
Then the vision of your scheme is blurred (blurred)
Courtesy of the illest cats that you ever seen or heard (what up!)
The third rock away from the sun is now mine (mine)
So to anybody fuckin with me or my shine (yeah!)

[Chorus - Akrobatik]
If we can't build, then you will be destroyed (now, now)
Now Bumpy Knuckles has a title, title
And Akrobatik, has a title, title (c'mon!)

If we can't build, then you will be destroyed
Yo, A to the K has a title, title
Yo, Freddie, Freddie Foxxx has a title, title (c'mon!)
And Illmind has a title, title (yeah!)
And Fat Beats has a title, title (yeah, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck)
If we can't build, then you will be destroyed (yeah!)

[Verse 2 - Bumpy Knuckles]
Yo, it's the dopest MC, with the O.G. flow
That real nigga shit, I spit, will drop you yo
Don't act like Ak won't come back with Bumpy, the clout
That's how I rock for my comrades, black (comrades, black)
In a hoodie, all black, car arched, forty below
And it ain't no talkin, just two 40's that blow (BLAOW!)
"How You Like Me Now" like Modie
If niggaz murder you, I'm a Co-D (what?)
Since I was a roadie, I was studyin oldies and O.G.'s
Ask any gangsta, they know me (that's what he do, my nigga)
See if we can't build, then you will be destroyed
Startin them bullshit beefs, you should avoid
If I get annoyed
You'll make the Amber Alert like a missing little boy (whoa!)

[Chorus - Akrobatik]
If we can't build, then you, what? (c'mon!)
If we can't build, then you will be destroyed
Now Bumpy Knuckles has a title, title
And Akrobatik, has a title, title (yeah!)

If we can't build, then you will be destroyed
A to the K has a title, title
Yo, Freddie, Freddie Foxxx has a title, title (c'mon!)
And Illmind has a title, title
Fat Beats has a title, title (buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, c'mon!)
If we can't build, then you will be destroyed (yo, c'mon)

[Break - Akrobatik]
All my hardcore heads, middle fingers up (one time!)
All my hardcore heads, middle fingers up (c'mon!)
If you can't build, then you will be destroyed (yeah!)
All my hardcore heads, middle fingers up
B-boys in the place, middle fingers up (yeah, what?)
All my hardcore heads, middle fingers up (what?)
Freddie Foxxx, Akrobatik in the place, what?
If we can't build, then you will be destroyed

[Outro - Akrobatik - talking]
Yeah, what up, what up
Uh, Big Ak and Bumpy Knuckles yo
Yo ass in fuckin trouble yo
Huh, what? (yeah!) 
The, the Blast Master has a title (yeah!)
The Blast Master has a title 
Think I forgot?
If we can't build, then you will be destroyed (yeah!)</pre>
