[3D]
A flask I drink of sober tea
While relay cameras monitor me
And the buzz surrounds it does
Buzz surrounds
Buzz surrounds

[Liz Fraser]
Closed eyed sky wide open
Unlimited girl unlimited sigh
Elsewhere
Indefinitely
Far away
Magnifies and deepens
Ready to sing
My sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath
And listening

[3D]
Keeps me from my hurt

[Liz Fraser]
My ears know that my eyes are closed

[3D]
Perish thoughs like contraband
I train myself in martial arts
As advertised
I reinforce my softened parts
As advertised

[Liz Fraser]
See through me little glazed lane
A world in myself
Ready to sing
My sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath

[3D]
Flickering I roam

[Liz Fraser]
And listening
My ears know that my eyes are closed
Ready to sing
My sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath

[3D]
Flickering I roam

[Liz Fraser]
And listening
My ears know that my eyes are closed

[3D]
I see to bolts
Put keys to locks
No boat are rocked
I'm free to roam
On dummy screens
And magazines

[Liz Fraser]

Closed eyed sky wide open
Unlimited girl unlimited sigh

[3D]
To think that I lay next to you
Wasting time when I could do
A simple job in strip lights
A flask I drink a sober tea
'Till daylight sends me home
Flickering I roam

[Liz Fraser]
Daydreaming admiring being
Quietly, open the world
I hear the time of the starry sky
Turning over at midnight
Seen through me little glazed lane
A world in myself
Daydreaming admiring being
Quietly, open the world
I hear the time of the starry sky
Turning over at midnight</pre>
