"If we goin platinum, next week we goin platinum" {2X}

[Shyheim]
Uh
Trees'll die to make paper so I can write rhymes on em
Niggas shoot up the studio tryin to kill me so I can't record em
I'm nuclear like hydrogen gases
Push my buttons and I bomb the masses
'Pac ain't worry, you know I'm keepin it live Thug Life
Never sleep, I'm awaken seven days, seven nights
I don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck
They call me Shy two times, I say everythin twice
Niggas be like "Kid aiight", but that's cynical
On the mic I'm invincible
Pop your end of tube, flatline, 7-2-8, crime time
promotin that live shit til I die
I'm so high, can't even open my eyes
What I do to MC's can't be televised
Blood everywhere, leave you terrified
Thuggin it out, I glorify
Do what I do to bring the honey to the hive (no lie)

Chorus: Squig Trust {2X}

Verbal Intercourse, comin at 'cha takin yours
Seagal niggas marked to death, we above the law
Gamble stacks, hustle cracks, cookin from the raw
Peace nigga if it ain't I guarantee it's war

[Shyheim]
Check this out y'all
Question, why you in my B.I.?
Spy ass nigga actin like you F.B.I.
You gossip like the girls do
I'ma smack the shit out you, watch
Better get your ox and your glocks
And be screamin "Shyheim, stop the cops from comin"
You a lame rapper dude, I wouldn't even write you somethin
This ain't nothin but a verse from my arsenal
I reposess styles, I'm the hip-hop marshall
Move a whole crowd from a dart-out groove
I'm headlinin, fuck a single, I perform armed robbery
You should've never been braggin
That's why you got carjacked for that Benz wagon
Bring it down to Philly, let my niggas tag it
Groupies, I don't touch em cuz I ain't tryin to get my Johnson Magic
In 1999 it's all about the papes
We could take it to the park
I catch wreck off anythin in the DJ crate
Make MC's feel raped
Don't make that mistake to step to me

Chorus {2X}

[Squig Trust]
I make money, take money, give me a break money
You talk a good one, but yo talk is cheap money
It's all about showin and provin
Show that shit to me, I stick ya up and keep it movin
Quick, in and out like the tai, Hit Em Up
For T.M.F. to take him on the rise, give it up
Cash Rules, jewels, all your life is a must
I get mines, nigga, it's only right, it's Squig Trust</pre>
