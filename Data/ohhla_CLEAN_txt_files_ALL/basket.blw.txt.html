Chorus:
They're playing Basketball
We love that Basketball
They're playing Basketball
We love that Basketball

(Now rapping Basketball, Number 1, Kurtis Blow)
Basketball is my favorite sport
I like the way they dribble up and down the court
Just like I'm the King on the microphone, so is Dr. J and Moses Malone
I like Slam-dunks, take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley-oop
I like the pick-and-roll, I like the give-and-go
Cause it's Basketball, uh, Mister Kurtis Blow

Chorus

I used to go to dinner, and then take the girl
To see Tiny play against Earl The Pearl
And Wilt, Big O, and Jerry West
To play Basketball at it's very best
Basketball has always been my thing
I like Magic, Bird, and Bernard King
And number 33, my man Kareem
Is the center on my starting team

(To the hoop, ya'll, Watch out, Watch out
 In yo' face, now here comes the rest)

Clyde, Rick Barry, and Pistol Pete
Now these players, could never be beat
Isiah, and Iceman too
Just give 'em the ball, and then you talk up too
Dantley and Wilkins are on the scene
And Ralph Sampson is really mean
Bill Russell didn't take no junk
and Darryl Dawkins got a monster dunk
Tell me, were you in the joint?
The night Wilt scored 100 points
Or when Celtics won titles back-to-back
And didn't give nobody, no kind of slack
Or when Dr. J shook the whole damn team
With moves that came right out of a dream
Or when, Willis Reed stood so tall
Playing D with desire, it's Basketball
