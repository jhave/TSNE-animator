It is what it izzzzzz..
It is what it izzzzzz..

You try compromisin, nope - they don't wanna talk
And they got them nuts that's off that Acapulco powdered chalk
So he untouchable - oh he can be touched??
Well where he stay at then - he stay by such and such??
Well since we got altercations with these so-called knuckleheads
we gon' play for dooms
And I assume we get radar on fool in dem livin rooms
Bet - motherfucker ain't fin' ta be runnin around here drippin sweat
Havin hot flashes and shit 
over these fulla bitch-made and a half-ass dicks
You ripped?  Let's take it to 'em sick
Hit all they spots at once - pour it on 'em thick
Who got the suey chops??  They in my folks garage
Well where he at??  He at the TravelLodge - BEEP THAT NIGGA!
Tell him to get here right now quick now it's gon' be some shit
Tell him to bring enough ammunition to blow up a ship
Bullshit ain't nothin this here been goin on just a little bit too long
Plus I got a family and kids to raise and I plan on seein 'em get grown
Get straight to the root of the problem
Get rid of the source that's what what
Get rid of the big cheese 
and the majority of these niggaz gon' back the fuck up
Somebody gon' mind somethin, time to validate my respection
Hit the corner dumpin, in the big-ass (??) stationwagon
CATCH THEM BITCH-ASS!! That's what I told my driver man
while I was tryin to get him to get in a position 
so that I could open fire
FUCK A SKI MASK!!  Unpolished fish grease
LET THE FULLY BLAST!!  May he rest in piss Miss smash up outta there
I brought them boys, but I shoulda brought it like a concert
Fool's still alive, John Murell(?) Trauma Center, Concord
Shoulda doused him, shouldn'ta never found him
Shoulda handled biz, but for now, it is what it izzzzz..
It is what it izzzzzz..
It is what it izzzzzz..
It is what it izzzzzz..

[Kaveo]
Aight, ay dude, this all I wanna know
What's wrong with this sad to be glad-ass noggas?
Don't they know that fools is laced with assassin skills?
Kill at will, gonna put your hat on the rack for a cool mill'?
(Awww it's gon' get done) but now the heat has been spared
How we gon' get him out of intensive care
and put him under the wing of a pall-bear?

[E-40]
One of my potnahs got a plug on some silencers, he knows some agents
He used dem (??) (??) shot on several different occasions
What that mean his family gon' boo-hoo when I smash that card
Better stay on a nigga brain give a FUCK ABOUT A DIE-HARD!
I know this one botch with a big-ass crotch by the name of Connie
She works in ICU and she dates this nigga named Mitchski Ronnie
Have nab him at the hospital, THAT'LL WORK
Paid a nurse to pull the plug on the LIFE SUPPORT
Risky business but it's organized class and the shit sound sharp
but if we fuck around and make it look too obvious
the broad might her lose her job
Tough luck that shit no better than fuckin for ME NOW
I gots no toilet paper feelings for her anyhow
The shit is crampin my livin style, floatin from telly to telly
Conspiracy murder plots phone conversations overheard by fedarale
I'm guessin fool musta passed away, tragic losses
On the wall they got my picture at the post office
After travellin bouncin back and forth to different states
they finally caught me up in Kansas City
at a barbecue spot called Gates
Do the crime do the time - it ain't for no bitch
and as long as a nigga twerkin in the kitchen, he ain't trippin
I'll be up in that bitch makin spreads, drinkin Pruno
Cocoa and coffee Cadillacs, jumpin jacks
Takin flicks, shootin kites, makin wishes
Fuck around and get mad on the strength of con-ju-gal vi-sits
Flip the weight pile, hit my fee-vee(?)
Keep my shank close by me when I'm slee-py
Shouldn'ta caught me, shouldn'ta never found me
Shoulda handled biz, but it's too late, it is what it izzzzz..
It is what it izzzzzz..
It is what it izzzzzz..
It is what it izzzzzz..

[Kaveo]
Oh, ohh I see
It is what it was, and what it was is just what's been taught
Handle biz when it's to be done, and I mean rip you dig?
Cause ain't no sense in savin leftovers
That's yesterday's thing, roll with the right now
and everything gon' be is, what it izzzzzz..</pre>
