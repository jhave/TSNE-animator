[ VERSE 1 ]
Now you can come visit any time of year
And the sun is shinin and the skies are clear
If you're lookin for love you can find it here
So give Diz a couple minutes up inside your ear
I'm lookin for the light like a Jedi Knight
So I'm headed for Brazil on a red-eyed flight
Cause I gotta hit the festival (Tell em why) it's set to go
Four whole days at a very high decibel
We cut loose and dance in the streets
All the way down to Copacabana Beach
And when it's all over recovery mode
I'm out in Ipanema to relax and reload
Cause I think we got a UD show tomorrow
And I have to go to São Paulo - I know
Andy's at a soccer game, Rod's in a speedo
I'm not Michael Caine but I _Blame it on Rio_

[ CHORUS ]
You gotta go to Rio, go to Rio with me
If you wanna carnival, carnival with me
Cause you need to get away, get away with me
And we're gonna do it now, do it now with me
If you gotta go to Rio, go to Rio with me
If you wanna carnival, carnival with me
Cause you need to get away, get away with me
To

(Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Get off the sofa, let's bossanova
Come and do la cosa nostra
And we're gonna make it like presto
Alakazaam, out with my man windjam on the catamaran
It's Rio de Janeiro, nail the map with a thumb tack
And before you unpack you wish you could come back
(Why?) Because the weather's warm and toasty like an oven mitt
And I'd be lyin if I said I wasn't lovin it
Watch the palm trees sway in the breeze
Beautiful girls talkin to me in Portuguese
I do ( ? ) nada, which means the minimum
Sippin Brazilian coffee with a bit of cinnamon
Do you find the daily grind is inescapable?
Have a rest from the stress ( ? )
There's no other place to go (bro) it's the apex
Talk to your boss and save up your paychecks

We gotta
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
We gotta go
Let's go, let's go

(Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro)

[ CHORUS ]
You gotta go to Rio, go to Rio with me
If you wanna carnival, carnival with me
Cause you need to get away, get away with me
And we're gonna do it now, do it now with me
You gotta go to Rio, go to Rio with me
If you wanna carnival, carnival with me
Cause you need to get away, get away with me
To
(Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro)
