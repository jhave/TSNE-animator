[Verse 1]
Yo!  Hangin' low, chiefin' high.
Time to make you haters cry
Circulatin' gossip 'bout the Lady you deserve to die
Memphis Queen will set it off
Never ever play me soft
Always 'bout my business, be a witness while I write you off
Please stop beepin' me, since I fuck you won't stop beepin' me
Is it cause you sippin' on that syrup or takin' ecstasy?
I don't wanna play wit you, Mrs. Villain Gangsta Boo
Got no time for you cause I be busy with my fuckin' crew
Out to get some paper and you know just how the ball bounce
Yellin' "Fuck a hater!" Blowin' hydro smoke up out my mouth
Ridin' with the limo tint, system bumpin' triple 6
Just a lovely lady independent tryin' to make it rich
Just to let you know I peep you out and how you look at me
Ballin' in yo' friends Mercedes, smiling like you foolin' me
Never are you foolin' me, Ladies represent with me
How you got the clout when, nigga, you be out here chasin' me?

[Chorus x2]
What these niggas want from a bitch?
(what you want)?
What these niggas want from a bitch?
(really want)

[Verse 2]
What you niggas want from a bitch
You niggas makin' me sick
Be actin' like you a baller just to get in my shit
Cause a lady ( I ) she don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a nigga that can get the fuck from me
And glistenin' in yo' white gold chains
Saw me ridin' in the Benz nigga doin' my thang
So I don't need you. I got my car keys plus a check book
Two way constantly jumpin' sendin' me messages "Boo, I love you"
Anyway playa I'ma say whats on my fuckin mind
I don't give a fuck what you write I ain't fantizin'
OK got a car, OK got that ice, OK nigga cool shit ya life is aight
Now what ya wife be tellin me ya business my nigga
I don't care about your figures, I'm a playa my nigga
I'ma mack till I fall ya'll, keepin' it tight
So tell me why you wanna get with Mrs. Lady Aight?

[Chorus x 2]
What these niggas want from a bitch?
(what you want)?
What these niggas want from a bitch?
(really want)

[Verse 3]
"G"- Is Gotta talk, I gotta let you niggas know tha bizz
"A"- Is Always on my P's and Q's you boys know what it is
"N"- This heater Nine is always by my side when I be cruisin'
"G"- Is Grabbin' at me when I'm buckin' plus I'm never losin'
"S"- Is Sorry man I gots no time I'm down hea platinum nine
"T"- This Triple six is sellin out it ain't no stoppin now
"A"- Is ATL is where we represent this lady gangsta
"B"- Is Boomin' system in the caddy plus the navigation
"O"- Is On my dog, why you let her have the drought always
"O" cause it's my time Gangsta Boo just hit the charts
Number ONE that's off the top
Crazy lady blew the spot
Spotted me in NYC I'm blazin' people off the block
Niggas love me cause I'm thorough, bitches hate me cause they ain't
Niggas tell me that they love me when the really want my bank
But you playas know you can't get nothin from the Lady
You need to come and tell me what you want from me baby

[Chorus x 2]
What these niggas want from a bitch?
(what you want)?
What these niggas want from a bitch?
(really want)</pre>
