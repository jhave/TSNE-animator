[Chorus: Cold 187Um]
Let me tell you somethin'
about the way we do it, where we from
In the City of Angels --------------&gt; Big Hutch
We are from Los Angeles
And no other city can handle us
But if you think you could..
Creep with me, as I roll through the hood ---&gt; Kid Frost
 
[Cold 187Um]
They always yellin' out freeze
When I'm on the back streets gettin' mine
Dodgin' the law, dodgin' the chalk line
And if y'all feel me, I'ma keep it real for this episode
Takin' you all, into some critical overload
What must I do, to live in the City of Angels?
Pack a full clip, with one cocked in the chamber? "that's right"
Cause it remains to be the same to me
I gotta be an O.G. like my daddy and my grandpappy
Don't ever test mine, don't ever disrespect mine
Better yet, I tote a Tech, incase you ever cross the line
Yo, I'm like the crow, low down and dirty
As I handle my business and as I take you on this journey
It ain't no City Of Angels where I'm at
It's just people playin' get back and more get back
Yo, a lot of drama on my block but I never stress
Because I'm built like a Presidential Rolex
A lotta people die over the red or the blue "The Blue"
A lotta players hustle cause they got to      "cause they got to"
But if I ever go out before I'm supposed to go
I'm goin' revenge myself like the Crow
 
[Chorus: Cold 187Um]
Let me tell you somethin'
about the way we do it, where we from
In the City of Angels --------------&gt; Big Hutch
We are from Los Angeles
And no other city can handle us
But if you think you could..
Creep with me, as I roll through the hood ---&gt; Kid Frost
 
[Km.G]
Welcome to the city of drag, where my pants sag
And my homies still relyin' on the flag
Yeah, life starts to twist and turn
And it hits you at another angle "That's right"
Just some more drama in the City Of Angels
Violence is brought forth through many years
Broken memories, we cried so many tears
Ooh, the Devil plays the repo man
And he's suckin' up souls, as fast as he can
It ain't no question, it's in our nature
A 45 can bring out the criminal behaviour
When the clouds in the sky turn black and gloom
As soon as the smoke starts to fill the room
Your heart starts to beat, it's like the ritual
And the feelin' that you get, is somewhat spiritual
I'ma have to let you know, how reality goes
Make you fly like the Crow, as you slide into limbo
 
[Chorus: Cold 187Um]
Let me tell you somethin'
about the way we do it, where we from
In the City of Angels --------------&gt; Big Hutch
We are from Los Angeles
And no other city can handle us
But if you think you could..
aiy, Creep with me, as I roll through the hood ---&gt; Kid Frost
 
[Kid Frost]
I see the clock strike half past
I'm movin' fast, quick to blast
I'm like an angel in the city with the devil's path
And everybody's out to get me
So I quickly, stick and move
And if he moves I trip, my finger's itchy
I got a vision, I'm on a mission
Listen, I can hear them but I can't trust my intuition
I'm wishin, upon that midnight mystical
And through the darkness, I'm hopin' for a miracle
I can't holler till you hear me
I gotta get me, through the madness, even though I'm guilty
And as I reload, I'm all alone, sets to explode
Like a pathological murderer, that's in the zone
I know the working, the spirit's lurkin'
I'm hurting, the triple six with the kiss got my soul searchin'
When I awoke, I choked on a cloud of smoke
It was a dream and in my dream, I seen a black crow
 
[Chorus: Cold 187Um X2]
Let me tell you somethin'
about the way we do it, where we from
In the City of Angels --------------&gt; Big Hutch
We are from Los Angeles
And no other city can handle us
But if you think you could..
Creep with me, as I roll through the hood ---&gt; Kid Frost
Creep with me, as I roll through the hood ---&gt; Kid Frost</pre>
