Song:   Keep it Kali
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We keep it Kali on a Sunday afternoon now
Smoking on dank these just the things that we do
This is the way that we do it in Kali
Southern California's puffin' on that Maui Wowie
Left coast living, fishing, bustin' on the Kawi's
And you know we still up and down valleys
When we rolling in Kali

Staying high off the crypt we always getting' blazed out
D-Loc and Johnny Richter what you talking about
Growing up in Southern Kali where the weather stays warmer
Where the buds are green and where we live around the corner

The land of backyard parties getting drunk and stoned
So many girls act naughty when you get them alone

And when you get them all alone you know the shit's always crackin'
D-Loc, Johnny Richter, Daddy X, what's happening

[Chorus]
We keep it Kali on a Sunday afternoon now
Drinking on drinks see we've got nothing to prove
We keep it Kali on a Sunday afternoon now
Smoking on dank these just the things that we do

We live in Kali, where it's always warm
Traffic and fake titties are the norm
Where honeybees buzz all day and swarm
Where bong water spills in college dorms
Where surfers, stoners and gang bangers ride
Street codes are controlled from the inside
Real Estate prices are way too high
But doctors and lawyers and police get high
Where Hollywood movies play out in real life
Gold digging bitch turned desperate house wife
Where we roll it and lick it and kick it man
When you need to get stoned I'm your fix-it man

[Chorus]

We just some stoners reeking havoc from the west coast
Southern California is the only place for me

It's the d double dash double o double boogie
Yo I keep that shit popping with the gangsta boogie
Where them low riders roll and them 6-4's high

And we got the rag top popped open down the block
Riding streets so smooth ya better move out the way
Light up my back tires like I'm lighting a J

Well light that ass end up you'll get taken out quick
Red, yellow, green you better pound that shit

You got your foot to the floor but you need some more
I got my foot on the gas now I'm making a pass

When you making a pass yo I'm making them mad
I'm hella fucked up while I'm grabbing a flag

[Chorus]</pre>
