[Baby Cryin', Scary music, laughin' voice .. ]

Good evening, and welcome to Eazy's playhouse, 
you stupid muthafuckaaaaaa!

[a low bass metal voice .. ]

Now that you got the album, 
what the fuck are you gonna do with it,
BITCH BITCH Bitch bitch ...

Eazily I aproach, the microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell your momma to get off of my tip
I have no time to give her my dick
I'm gonna hold it
And walk around the stage and
If you fuck up I'm goin' to get my gage and
Unload the barrel and lough
Cuz I'm puttin' led in your mothafuckin' ass
Psychopathic, but the ho's are attracted
Because when I'm on hard my dick's at least a yard
In the days of old I was a nut
Now I need at least 3 ho's when I fuck
Cuz I do a check, nut 1 nut 2
Then I save my nut for when there's nothin' else to do
You're used to the crew, bitch
Cuz I would never quit
As soon as you think that's it I'm still talkin' shit

-=- CuT -=-

I told you that nigga was crazy
E boy, that's my boy, godamnit

-=- CuT -=-

I got a fable that you need to listen to
It's a funky little rhyme about a bitch or a two
One Sharone and the other one Shine
I want to nut but which one do I want?
Shine said Eazy let me fuck you blind
And Sharon said E I want to blow your mind
I said fuck it, I know what should be done
Just pull your panties down and I'll fuck the biggest one
And then I get the other pussy put it in the freezer
So I can always have a on-hold skeezer
Get out to tick it, I do it like that
So I told the ho's to take a big step back
Took the zipper down, I'z wide and said
Here's what I'm gonna put inside
Grab it like a rabbit, grab it let's wreck it
But I won't love you,
When I'm done I'd still be talkin' shit ...

-=- CuT -=-

That boy'z good
Yeah that boy's good
That mothafucka'z talkin' all kinds of shit
I used to get pussy like eazy here and every day
You're mothafuckin' lyin'
How you know I'm mothafuckin' lyin'?
You're lyin', your dick can't get hard ..
Oh, suck my dick mothafucka
Nigga you lied
Who you're talkin' to..?
...

-=- CuT -=-

Dre : Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut that shit,
      HEY YO YELLA BOY! LET'S REWIND IT!

-=- CuT -=-

Niggaz don't see I'm a 100% legit
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit
It's about fuckin' this bitch and that bitch
But not the bitch with the 7 day itch, like that ho'
Just throwin' me the pussy
She says she wants to do it like a doggy
She's bad, nobody is badder
But she got more crabs than a seafood platter
Bitch on the gang move, to skizz me
Just to say "I got fucked by Eazy"
So I slapped the ho' like a pimp
I might be a women-beater but I'm not a pussy-eater
So when the shit hits the fan it's outta my mouth
You don't like what I'm talkin' about
All of ya'll can just suck my dick
You can quote me now cuz I'm still talkin' shit ..

-=- CuT -=-

The boy's good, I told you the boy's good
The nigga has talent
You don't know a damn thing
Yeah, I like that part, bring that shit back one more time, Maestro
I can do the bagaloo
That old shit did'nt play out in 1967 ...
Hey fuck you, fuck you ..</pre>
