We the
Ones Who
Made us
The life styles that we live
Radios'
scared to
Play us
Life styles like this
Industry
Fools can't
Fade us
The life styles that we live
So Fuck off
All you
Haters
Some things you don't forget

[Loc]
My brain's kinda cloudy
I can't really think
Popped too many pills
Had one too many drinks
It's the Double Double
D to the Dash
Gives a fuck what you say
Got a pocket full of cash
and the other full of hash
Straight dank all about the bong tokes
Whatchu talk about the name is Dloc
Everybody knows I bust flows and spread ass cheeks
Shit on the real I clown a lotta industry geeks
Remember Dat
Don't hate, Relate
Just respect my shit I gives a Fuck whatchu think
If you talk too much you'll be shit outta luck
Try da' fill my shoes on the mic you'll get booed
Dirty with my sex you remember dat between sweet of me ?*****
I fuck you in the ass you can keep your virginity
Try the walk my walk, try the talk my talk
My status is worldwide, you still put on ya socks

We the
Ones Who Made us

So Fuck off (Fuck off!)
All you (All you!)
Haters (Hataz!)
Some things you don't forget

[Richter]
Walkin around like a zombie, drunk struttin
Sclicin N dicin the crowd, dippin and cuttin
Smoke follow me around you can say I'm tough lovin
People screamin' in my hear, But I ain't hearin nothin
My eye's are wide open and my standards set high
I'm lookin for the one to call my cutie pie
I'm tryin to find a little hottie to take home tonight
But I definately ain't lookin for a wife
Just some spices of life, someone to make me sweat
Type that been awake all day but we ain't got outta bed
Don't fuck with my head but give the bomb his brain
And cleans my house before she leaves, you know what I'm sayin?
Thats the life style I'm livin, thats just how it works
If I ain't spittin out rhymes then I'm liftin up skirts
I'll have mah own plane flyin high in the daze
Come on in and get lost in my fun house maze

Back on the scene same team
you know the kottonmouth kings reign supreme
Us lead, You misconceived
We gotta gift, livin the life, doin the things you wish
And we still hit the stage smokin chronic spliffs
If you thought it was finished you have badly been mistaken
This time we takin over Bringin home all of the bacon
So here's my verdit, Pay attention, Listen closely
There's No One in the world that can Fuckin Out Smoke me!

[Loc]
Forced me to do it(why?), now I have to(why?)
Ima leave you standin stone like a statue
Speechless, as I let loose with blows
Left, rights, combinations, uppercuts, body blows
body blow, elbow, there goes your nose
Dont ever try to test, I never try to rap hard
But if you push the wrong button, Loc will leave you scarred
I ain't talkin physically, I penetratin mentally
