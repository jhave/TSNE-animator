[Chorus]
Uh
Go girl, get it girl. Show em' whatchu got
I hope you really know that you're worth a whole lot
With the world in your hands, you ain't neva gon' stop
Naw you gon' make it to the top [x2]

[Verse 1]
Such a big girl livin' in a big city
Remember high school you was just pretty
Now you in college ya lookin' so beautiful
Ya got your nails did, I see your lil cuticles
Ya got five classes working two jobs though
Can only get a little help from ya moms though
It's all good tell momma you don't need it
Cause you a big girl and everybody see it
I know ya pops probably really really proud of ya
He'll do anything just to see a smile on ya
And if them dudes ever try to act foul on ya
You know that he gon' be the one to put it down for ya
Oh, you hear em' say you ain't ready to be alone
You won't survive out here on your own
But you don't care what they sayin'
Graduation time gon' raise your hand

[Bridge]
Work for the money gon' get it girl
Show em' what you got chu a big girl
People gon' hate cause they don't know
Don't know how much you want it baby

[Chorus]
Go girl, get it girl
Show em' whatchu got
I hope you really know that you're worth a whole lot
With the world in your hands, you ain't neva gon' stop
Naw you gon' make it to the top [x2]

[Verse 2]
Still such a big girl livin' in a big city
You neva sleep now it seems ya too busy
You got goals so you're steady trynna stack it up
Set your boyfriend to left he was acting up
New job so your down with the roomates
Your best friend two months from her due date
Your gonna be a god mother very soon babe
You let the use the guest room at your new place
You'll learn the hard way not to give your heart away, to a liar
You had too many heartbreaks
There's somebody out there who would die for ya
Don't even know it, but they standin' in line for ya
Oh, keep your head up don't worry
Sunshine's comin' your way
Your whole family in the stands
Gon' celebrate gon' do your dance

[Bridge]
Work for the money gon' get it girl
Show em' what you got chu a big girl
People gon' hate cause they don't know
Don't know how much you want it baby

[Chorus]
Go girl, get it girl
Show em' whatchu got
I hope you really know that you're worth a whole lot
With the world in your hands, you ain't neva gon' stop
Naw you gon' make it to the top [x8]</pre>
