[Snoop Dogg - talking]
Hey yo Fred Wreck
Hey yo Fred
Yo, I'm tryin to fuck with all them fly
(Girls, girls, girls, girls)
Oh yeah
(All we really want is girls, girls, girls, girls)
(All we really want is girls, girls, girls, girls)
I'm lookin for a bad little girl

[Snoop Dogg]
Man it's a hundred degrees outside but I don't give a [fuck]
I'm tryin to find a freak with a big old butt
Cute and thick, rich and mixed
Full of chips, ass and lips, fingertips and hips (woo)
Bad little thing hangin at the ocean
'Malibu' style, Pacific coastin
Waitin on the pimpin to sail in
And them gang bangin, has just bailed in
Who that? Where that? With 'em, sit 'em
Send 'em and tell 'em I'll be right with 'em (with 'em)
Crackin 'em, smackin 'em, white or black
In the back of the ..
Man it's spectacular (tacular)
Treated 'em, never midleadin 'em (leadin 'em)
Poppin 'em, stoppin 'em, beatin 'em (beatin 'em)
Greetin 'em, fondle are beats and them (and them)
And lettin them mingle with Fred and them (Fred and them)
My other little freaks is so executive
Grew up with a gang of shit in which I never did (uh uh)
Neither did my homeboy E (E)
So watch how the game gonna see (see)
We gonna watch the girls take they pearls
And now we sittin on top of the world
Comin from the house that's haunted with extras on it
And now we [motherfuckin] "Malibu's Most Wanted"

[E-White]
The skinniest [bitch] with a tanktop on
If I come correct I'm a take somethin off
It's been a while since I hit the water
Where the women hang out 'til the early mornin
And I can see the sun set
Been mackin all day, but we ain't done yet
Hop in the picnic, poppin a thick [bitch]
And stop in the parkin lot to hit the dipstick
Women almost naked, so I post up on the car like check it
[Bitches] breakin they neck, starin at a [bitch]
Steady lookin back
It's a [nigga's] way to get away
I've been workin all week, now it's time to play
So light the blunt up and crack a six pack
And have a seat at the beach and kick back

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs
(girls, girls, girls)
All we really want is girls, girls, girls
Can you help us find some girls, girls, girls
All we really want is girls, girls, girls
We'll be looking for them girls, girls, girls

All we really want is girls, girls, girls
Can you help us find some girls, girls, girls
All we really want is girls, girls, girls
We'll be looking for them girls, girls, girls
