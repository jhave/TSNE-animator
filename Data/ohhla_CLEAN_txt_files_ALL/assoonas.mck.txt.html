Song:   As Soon As I Wake Up
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

As soon as I wake up
I'm going to change my ways
Because the music's my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
I'm going to change my ways

Instead of staying the same
Because I see better days ahead of me
I paint them on the page
Then I save them for the rainy ones
When anger and the anguish want to hang around
I say em outloud and complain to them
I figure I'm made to live and haven't gone that far
But I made it here so if there is a god I give thanks to him
Then I take a pen and make amends again
The only way I know to repent
I know somebody listenin

Dear God I'm so thankful for you keeping my plate full
The struggles, heartache, pain, the progress and the breakthrough
Every single track has made who I am to this day
Prove this page is the only way to paint you
But lately it's like my soul feels counterfeits
Scared to pick up the pen to see what the hell might come out of it
So God grant me the serenity without giving me the christianing
Because all I ever needed was a beat and people listening
Step cousins

As soon as I wake up
I'm going to change my ways
Because the music's my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
I'm going to change my ways

Instead of rotting away and plotting my grave, hiding in a bottomless shame
I found a way to fight my way out and see the light of day
And proud to say I took the safe route but there's a price to pay
They like to keep my name in they mouth and tell lies on me
What you see is what you get, truth in the flesh homie
You can do the rest I'm through with trying to prove myself to you
I'll see you when you wake up, hope the feeling is mutual

Now for artists and musicians you see the target's to list
To the heart inscripts with no margins, no limits
To make to pain, strengths and rays a part of the picture
And can bathe in every shade and take it further and vivid
They're going to say what they say
The - and whatever the dj plays they mark and they gimmick
But I've got a path to follow and along with the distance I realize I'm already awake
I'm just starting to live it. My language

As soon as I wake up
I'm going to change my ways
Because the music's my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
I'm going to change my ways</pre>
