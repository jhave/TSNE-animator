(1st verse) 
Levantore! 
Yeah, it's just ghetto, kid test the devil to hit the next level 
Wish they was a rebel with cerebral metal 
Inflex the bezzle with the peddle to the metal 
In a thug's paradise where love have a price 
So we love for life like thugs love the night 
They sell drugs for ice for the Benz with bug lights 
Some hug mics to the world, hung like parasites 
The likes lethal, the mics lead you 
A sneak preview, watch what we do and what the hood teach you 
I still see through the eye of a needle 
So I can watch people cause slug backwards is evil 
  
(2nd verse) 
Levantore! 
Yo, what's this? Yo bust this. Yo it's time to up lift 
They think all we do is bust clips and puff splifs 
And plush whips and clutch chips and touch chicks 
Flont rocks like Fort Knox and hog blocks 
Taunt cops with more props and we want not 
Panhandling with your mans and them 
Scrambling, gambling, plans to win 
While the cops clock em, thieves flock em 
Women watch em, traders wanna top em 
Ay yo what's the problem 
Before the narcs knock em opposite playas plot to rob em 
The ghetto got em, my man said it's rough at the bottom 
  
(3rd verse) 
Levantore! 
Ghetto alert, let's do whatever work to get rid of the curse 
We went from 1st to America's worst 
On this competitive turf, now let's inherit the earth 
There's more prize for one another, and call shots 
12:00 til the next ball drop 
All year around plus they shuffle non stop 
You think it's rough at the bottom, it's even rougher on top 
My peeps gonna have to reach and turn for me 
And everybody's side of the street'll be celly 
Ain't nothing funny, burn plenty and burn money 
And earn money and watch the century turn 20 
  
(4th verse) 
Levantore! 
We all should, from the woods to the big city and the small hood 
Everybody should be welcome to the ball if we all could, 
But we fall cause we brawl, yo it ain't all good 
We need to play right, stay tight with ya air alight 
Keep your game tight, no need to play trife 
Get cheese from the daylight to the late night 
And it's shouldn't take death to appreciate life 
Before a lot parish, we got to cherish if Allah let us 
Let's give prop and merits till the block flourish 
In this metropolis, stay on top of this 
You know what the prophet is, be prosperous 
  
(5th verse) 
Levantore! 
Now we networking 
Respect the next person, it'll be less hurting 
Or left lurkin, while we kept our dreads working 
Connect set for certain, total networking 
Last chance to advance and stash grands 
If you have plans to have fam and mad land 
Own shine, condone crime or hold 9s 
I know what the problem is, killing our own kind 
To my flame throwers, train sober, remain soldiers 
Stay sane so these pretty dames can hold us 
Terror terrain rollers and Range Rovers so the train goers 
Claim your fame, maintain, till your game's over 
  
(6th verse) 
Levantore! 
Ghetto alert, let's do whatever work to get rid of the curse 
We went from 1st to America's worst 
On this competitive turf, now let's inherit the earth 
There's more prize for one another, and call shots 
12:00 til the next ball drop 
All year around plus they shuffle non stop 
You think it's rough at the bottom, it's even rougher on top 
My peeps gonna have to reach and turn for me 
And everybody's side of the street'll be celly 
Ain't nothing funny, burn plenty and burn money 
And earn money and watch the century turn 20
