Typed by: AZ Lyrics

(Tic-Tac-Toe)
I'm lining up my X's and O's telling N9na let's go nigga!
(Get Dat Dough)
Kali Baby, we world wide now, tell ya girl bye for now and
(FU Pay Me)
I'm looking for them checks next, looking for the exit, thats it
FU got a wife, sister, mama, and nephew with little Christopher
What the F you think im spittin' for?
I'm not living for the middle living the given is difficult
Gotta live it up but life is pitiful
A pedestal, I put myself on, nobody gave me a damn thing
Stealin' vans, different lands, we doin' the same thing
It's time to pay the piper, freestyles for decipher
Ain't no volunteer, look how far we got here
I been in places that you never been
colored money, get it Netherlands
I get around like a ceiling fan
I need my chips with dip or meet my pistol grip
'Cause if I slip, nigga, Crystal will trip, baby!
And I see some ladies tonight
that should be havin' my baby
FU Pay Me!

[Chorus - Krizz Kaliko]
FU Pay Me
I'm not doin' it for free, I'm doin' it for me, tell 'em again!
FU Pay Me
I'm not doin' it for fun, I'm doin' it for money, honey
FU Pay Me
That's to get lots of matzah, that's what we after
FU Pay Me
I'm up the Presidents to represent me like Obama

[Makzilla]
We have you known me not to have no cash?
When have you seen me with a bitch that ain't bad?
See me in a color other than red?
When have you heard about me talking the Feds?
There's two sides to every joke, a partner best believe
I know green thumb, niggas with them coca leaves
You see the game ain't the same, man, it's reasonable doubt.
Niggas falling off the chain when it's a reasonable drought
In every hood, there's a snitch nigga running his mouth
But I was smart, I took my stash, told my brothers I'm out
Hold up, back up
Via, Diaz
Bitch nigga's envy
Jealious, not us
Hand cuff, your bitch
She know, we rich
That's why, your face
She rots Disney
Script writer, only know how to ball
No rehearsal, niggas know we die alone.

[Chorus - Krizz Kaliko]
FU Pay Me
I'm not doin' it for free, I'm doin' it for me, tell 'em again!
FU Pay Me
I'm not doin' it for fun, I'm doin' it for money, honey
FU Pay Me
That's to get lots of matzah, that's what we after
FU Pay Me
I'm up the Presidents to represent me like Obama

[Tech N9ne]
I'm still coming for that Absolute Power money
And I know they don't really want to have a shoot shower for me
Especially when I'm in L.A., they lay like a hour from me
Let me stop cause here's what makes the thing on gour yummy
And I eat that with a waffle, I regret I didn't pop you
No respect I get hostile, checks you owe Tech his colossol
Many consecutive checks you kept I can stretch, that is awful
But I suggest you get it even if an address given, sex in a brothel
All that money must have left you lazy
Guess you took a couple more steps too crazy
We one hundred but take a guess who's shady
With a handle did mantle man accept you lady?
I gee this really piss your nephew daily
And it's serious now that cause Tech grew babies
Even if you say you send all that's left to Haiti
FU Pay Me!

[Chorus - Krizz Kaliko]
FU Pay Me
I'm not doin' it for free, I'm doin' it for me, tell 'em again!
FU Pay Me
I'm not doin' it for fun, I'm doin' it for money, honey
FU Pay Me
That's to get lots of matzah, that's what we after
FU Pay Me
I'm up the Presidents to represent me like Obama</pre>
