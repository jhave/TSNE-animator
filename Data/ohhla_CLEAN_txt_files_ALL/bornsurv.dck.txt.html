[President Barack Obama sample]
Our most induring responsibility to future generations

[Cormega]
They say God don't like ugly, blessings are upon us
Bush hated niggas, now the President's a brotha
Whether you in the gutter, or your residence enormous
That shit don't matter when death around the corner
Before your book of life ends, recognize the author
All praise due, things you do bring karma
Your seeds shouldn't eat cuz you beefing with baby mama
Will be the one you need when police raid the corners
Ain't nothing but niggas fronting, shitty drugs and drama
Girls who want Prada, women who want powder
Children are more violent, from living with less guidance
And don't learn respect til they bidding with old timers
You walk the same path now they road is wiser
A quiet man's a giant when his code is silence
Speak volume, loud dudes ain't always liver
My city never sleep, I'm a born survivor

[President Barack Obama sample]
No matter how much money we invest in our community
How many ten point plans, we propose
How many government programs we want
None of it will make a difference
Atleast not in our predicament
We also at the same time, don't cease more responsibility in our own life

[Inspectah Deck]
I slang base and that powder too, team was the wildest crew
I seen what a dollar do
Broke nights fiend for a pot of food
Lean on the block rude, cream got 'em popping tools
And they don't stop to get it, get it
Four shots'll wet your fitted, four cops'll get acquitted
I roll dolo, I don't ask for love
Niggas be acting up, afterwords catching slugs
Every hood got heaters, many generals defeated, heavy metal pop frequent
The world crazy foul, how we suppose raise a child
Face a trial, bail over eighty thou'
In the street life, you game, player?
Haze make the pain clear, eight days the same stare
So mama say a prayer, cuz I'm out there
I'mma keep talking til they here

[President Barack Obama sample]
Providing guidance to our children
Turning off the TV sets, putting away the video games
Helping our children with their homework
Teaching our daughters to never allow images on television to tell
what they're worth
Teaching our sons to treat women with respect
That what makes them a man is not the ability to have a child but to raise one

[Inspectah Deck]
I thought the block was all there was to life
Surfing on the drug sites, meeting up at nights
And I got tired of roaming hall, got wise to protocol
And I got mines with no regard
So all I know, is all I show
So all I see, before I go
That all I am is the truth with this land
And this roof over head, and this root to the futute fruits
Worth more than your Gucci boots
I ain't trashing fashion, I like to do me too
Still I'm guick to pop it off
With the model broad or with the Molotov
Light rocks at your tank, might make me
Take the safety off and pop it in your bank, like
You see me, I'm major
I told this story to a class of 9th graders
They saying 'Fuck school, we some fly gangstas'
I gave 'em something that can change their life later

[President Barack Obama sample]
That's a message we need to send</pre>
