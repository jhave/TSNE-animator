Nate Dogg (echo)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I think she's tryin' to hide it
I know she's so excited
Time for some bump and grindin'
I think she wants to ride it

[Chorus: Girl]
You think I'm tryin' to hide it
You think I'm so excited
Well boy I can't deny it
Allthough I'm tryin' to fight it (She can't deny it)

[Rob Stricklong]
This chick is thick
She got a fat ass rub it back and forth from the tip of my dick
head, horse and thick with real big titties
The finest one I done seen in three cities (I know)
She's a pro, lovin' this bomb diggy
Got plans of makin' her my kiddie
But she don't understand, I come from a land
There's program to show bitches no pitty

[Nate Dogg]
Everytime I walk down the street
A bunch of women lookin' at me
Could it be my F-A-C-E
Or could it be my fuckin' money
Everytime I open my door
Man I swear I see another hoe
I didn't see them hoes when I was broke
I'm really glad I got some indo

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I think she's tryin' to hide it
I know she's so excited
Time for some bump and grindin'
I think she wants to ride it

[Chorus: Girl]
You think I'm tryin' to hide it
You think I'm so excited
Well boy I can't deny it
Allthough I'm tryin' to fight it (She can't deny it)

[Rob Stricklong]
Don't fight the feelin'
My stick ain't to short, I be in there like a Newport
Givin' me sky cap, don't try to hide that
Deep though, bust a no got my gym hat
Armed Rob in the swiftlah of slim cat
You can catch me in the spot we're the tens at
Pull the tightest one, before the night is done
I'll be back, where here friends at

[Nate Dogg]
Fuck Halloween main this ain't no prank
Show me your way to make me some bank
Militarian she got no rank
She in control, yeah that's what she thank
She thank she tight but she ain't
She act like a coochie, don't stank
I keep it real cause I ain't no fake
Give me a bad girl, drank and some dank

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I think she's tryin' to hide it
I know she's so excited
Time for some bump and grindin'
I think she wants to ride it

[Chorus: Girl]
You think I'm tryin' to hide it
You think I'm so excited
Well boy I can't deny it
Allthough I'm tryin' to fight it (She can't deny it)

[Rob Stricklong]
Listen up baby, I'm a lieutenant
And me and Nate Dogg will shake y'all in a minute
If we ain't gettin' in it, it's a done deal
Another spot to feel, runnin' the mill
I keep my rubber, you stay on a pill
Rockin', non stoppin', keep lockin'
In the bed got the headboard knockin'
I like a chick that'll do what she feel

[Nate Dogg]
Whatever you do girl don't get drunk
Already used a bad excuse once
She fillin' up better grab her damn cup
She gonna find Hennessy ain't no punk
Showin' out just to get what she wants
Don't even drink girl hear it this one
I know you smoke so you don't need to front
Nate dogg about to beat this thang up

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I think she's tryin' to hide it
I know she's so excited
Time for some bump and grindin'
I think she wants to ride it

[Chorus: Girl]
You think I'm tryin' to hide it
You think I'm so excited
Well boy I can't deny it
Allthough I'm tryin' to fight it (She can't deny it)

[Nate Dogg &amp; Girl]
I think she's tryin' to hide it (She can't deny it)
You think I'm tryin' to hide it (She can't deny it)
I know she's so excited (She can't deny it)
Allthough I'm tryin' to fight it (She can't deny it)</pre>
