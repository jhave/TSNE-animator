{*chipmunk voice*} 6 feet underground

Dice are rolling, Knives are out
with thee present danger all around
I don't say they mean harm, but they'd each give an arm
to see us six feet underground.
see us 6 feet under ground 
It doesn't matter what those morons say

[Chorus]
It's Murda I N C Uh, the Lord is calling me
My demons haunt me this really tortures me
cuz they don't understand me 
And while I'm holdin up I know you smilin' down 
at all my enemies who wanna see me (six feet underground)

[Ja Rule]
Look at me now hittin' em up holdin it down
cuz I'm destined to be I know you love to see me

(6 Feet Underground) and before that I believe
that I can fly most people gettin lye my niggas is gettin' by

[Ja Rule]
I'm so ignorant cuz I done played my last tears 
and pain is bliss been through so many things
it's hard to resist a mind that's currently
thinking on his last wish it's nothing to fuck with
when I know what I want because you must think I'm a fool
claiming you love what I do and be out playing the Rule
bad move, more cars, more hoes, more jewels, and I'd love
nothin more than to see you (6 Feet Underground) doesn't
matter how we gonna get outta weed rollin it outta mindows
nor from adam? but we show them uh now we leave them niggas
creating a deal let it open so won't be goin (6 Feet Underground)
because I've feel I've cursed
my body and soul I been outta control ever since I fell in the zone
I want nothin more than to see my niggas eat with me
but my enemies want nothin more than to see me (6 Feet Underground)

Chorus: (2x)

The Lord is calling me
My demons haunt me this really tortures me
cuz they don't understand me 
And while I'm holdin up I know you smilin' down 
at all my enemies who wanna see me (six feet underground)

[Ja Rule]

sort of a scarifice money, bitches, and ice.
but fuck it whoa whoa something let me

at police while I'm ridin' by I'm ghetto I don't fear
is deeper than love if you want to get it nigga then 
come on nigga get it in blood because I've feel I've cursed
my body and soul I been outta control ever since I fell in the zone
I want nothin more than to see my niggas eat with me
but my enemies want nothin more than to see me (6 Feet Underground)

Chorus: (2x)

The Lord is calling me
My demons haunt me this really tortures me
cuz they don't understand me
