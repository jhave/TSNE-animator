[Kardinal Offishall]
(Yeah, Celebrity Face, ain't it true enough?)
So where I rest I'm stressed by the 5-0 (Here we go)
Cops drive around the turf, lookin' for someone to search
With they flashlights checkin' in my dashboard
(Whatchu lookin' for?)
Or lookin' for the heat stashed under the seat
But I'm a rudebwoy, plus everything is legit (You knew it)
Worked too damn hard for my things (That's right)
I'm a celeb, I heard +99 Problems+
But understand that every rudebwoy is a king
So we watched, no face, and just play along
Everything I own's bling to the ding (Dun'know)
Them niggas think they have me shook but they dead wrong
Them pigs vexed Kardi youth have a little bit of fame
Didn't find nothin', so they screw-faced
Plus I never ever once lost my cool (No way!)
It's just a story of an everyday black man
Give thanks that the beast never pulled out they tools

[Hook: Ray Robinson]
You see I, yes I am an everyday rudebwoy
I am an everyday, an everyday rudebwoy,
I'm an everyday rudebwoy, I'm an everyday rudebwoy

[Kardinal Offishall]
I used to check this girl off in the West set
Had a baby girl by some dude
I used to hear second-hand from her brethren
That the youth was vexed, "Yo Kardinal I need food"
I used to hang with the girl every now and then
First met her chillin' out at the club
Body bangin' like she was in King magazine
Chopped her still, even though I wasn't rollin' on dubs
She used to live in the middle of the ghetto
Chickens yellin' on the block in the hood
Sometimes I used to hear the shots bellow
But they respect what I'm doin', so you know it's all good
So as I'm rollin' off, the baby father rollin' out
The youth lookin' at me dead in my eye
I said "You should have stuck it out with your family
But now that's girl's mean, so don't screw-face me!"
Because...

[Hook: Ray Robinson]
I am an everyday rudebwoy, I'm an everyday
I am an everyday rudebwoy, I'm an everyday
I am an evI am an everyday rudebwoy, yes I am
I'm a rudebwoy yes eryday rudebwoy, everyday, everyday yeah
I am.

[Outro: Kardinal Offishall (Ray Robinson)]
This is a story of my everyday, what!
