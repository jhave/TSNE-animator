(Master P/Chorus 2x)
Do you know your ABC's
If you do wantcha sang with me

(Lil' Romeo)
A for apple
B is for ball
Me and C went shopping at the mall
D came over in a E class benz
So F started fighting one of his friends
G said man do you believe in god
H say stop hatin wordy times is hard
I was watching the hawks and indiana
When Jalen Rose had six J's on atlanta

(Chorus 2x)

(Lil' Romeo)
Now special K was always cool
Why L and them they like to make moves
N and O I mean new orleans
Cause nolimit is the number one team
P stands for poppa he be puttin it down
And  is no question cause we the best around
R is for romeo I can rock the crowd
S for soulja music we be layin it down
T is for teaching
U is for united
V is for very important players invited
W is for my wordies on the team
We all souljas out that u-p-t
R.I.P. to the homies xyz
If you can sang this song
Then you know your abc's

(Chorus 2x)</pre>
