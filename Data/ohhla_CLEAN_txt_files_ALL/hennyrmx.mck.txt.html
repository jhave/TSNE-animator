[Intro: Mack Wilds]
Hennessy (Hennessy) Hennessy (Hennessy)

[French Montana]
Weed, Hennessy, a lil' sour (HAAAAAAAAA!!!!!)
Baby let's ride (HAAAAAAAAA!!!!!) HAAAAAAAAA!!!!!
Hey!

[Verse One: French Montana]
She feelin me, cup full of Hennessy
Baby show me love but, fuck me like the enemy (HAAAAAAAAA!!!!!)
Ha! By far baby less clothes
Yachts! Nah we don't do the fishin boats
Steak and lobster, I'm tryin to serve 'em
Turks and Caicos on the first, missed the flight
24 karats neck fully golden
Great ass black shades rollin 
Speedin in the European car like it's stolen
Coke Boyz made it to the top like we totin
My nigga Chinx Drugz told me (HA!) Motherfuck they feelings
Let's get these motherfuckin millions

[Verse Two: Havoc] (Mack Wilds)
(Hennessy) Double shots of the Hennessy, we 'gon kill this whole body
After this you 'gon remember me, it's not a case not too big
I will have your bitch callin over and over time a lineup
You soft wit' it she just want it wild rough
Boss wit' it took nothin got her riled up
And it's on and on everything around us

[Verse Three: Prodigy] (Mack Wilds)
Oooh baby you sexy fuck you that bitch!
(Hennessy) Bottles and shots and we twist
I'm that thug you wanna be with
And live a infamous life po' up and get lit
Stay away from that basic zone that's not us
We came here to party they came to watch us
And damn, I feel no remorse for your ex
Better take it easy, 'fore I crack him in the head with the (Hennessy)

[Verse Four: Mack Wilds]
How the hell did you get here? Was you sent from me?
Manhattan fly, Brooklyn bad, maybe Stapleton
I wish I had some more treats girl, just to trick on ya
But this money ain't impressive huh? Well
I'm a fly mu'fucker from around the way
S.I. 'til I die and I say it brave
Make money for my fam, fans are the inner me
And I'm smoother than a shot of 

[Chorus: Mack Wilds]
And I'm smoother than a shot of  Hennessy (Hennessy) Hennessy (Hennessy) Hennessy (Hennessy)
If I hit it then you 'gon remember me (Remember me) remember me (Remember me) remember me (Remember me)
And you ain't too cool to, pass by, what you sayin baby let's ride
You fuckin with the right guy, and I know your feelin me (Feelin me)
Yes your feelin me, Hey!

[Verse Five: Mack Wilds]
What the hell did you come for? Was it meant for us? 
To, lock eyes in this party baby girl, and maybe rush to crush
A young nigga from the slums of the city
Fresh but not the flow so gritty
Runnin shit Mr. Mack Milly, you're lookin like
I put that on my mama all my people say it with me
I'm a fly mu'fucker from around the way
S.I. 'til I die and I say it brave
Make money for my fam, fans are the inner me
And I'm smoother than a shot of 

[Chorus: Mack Wilds]
And I'm smoother than a shot of  Hennessy (Hennessy) Hennessy (Hennessy) Hennessy (Hennessy)
If I hit it then you 'gon remember me (Remember me) remember me (Remember me) remember me (Remember me)
And you ain't too cool to, pass by, what you sayin baby let's ride
You fuckin with the right guy, and I know your feelin me (Feelin me)
Yes your feelin me, Hey!

[Bridge: Mack Wilds]
Now once we chose to we're gone, ain't nothin to talk about
You really got me open girl, tryin to see if we can work it out
All I ask of you is never change
'Cause you fly you fine a dime
And I'm bout to make you sing my tape! Oh!

[Chorus: Mack Wilds]
And I'm smoother than a shot of  Hennessy (Hennessy) Hennessy (Hennessy) Hennessy (Hennessy)
If I hit it then you 'gon remember me (Remember me) remember me (Remember me) remember me (Remember me)
And you ain't too cool to, pass by, what you sayin baby let's ride
You fuckin with the right guy, and I know your feelin me (Feelin me)
Yes your feelin me, Hey!
