Alright let's ride

(Verse One: Scarface)
I spit my day right off a holiday broke and disgusted
With out enough money to buy food but I'm smoking so fuck it
Hit the school yard I would hard because I am larger then life
Close smokey eyes shining cause I am high as a kite fuck it
High school teachers I am a man of respect
South acres baby gangstas the man of respect
Fuck the school vice principal he shieved I'm leaving
Told my momma about my dope case and my momma believed him
Now my daddy got a problem with my edu-cation
So shy where the fuck mine let him know what they facin
Got the doctors who studied this but niggaz would doubt it
Probably take shrink at night time then you out of it (trust me)
I see the same thing flash change violent
And mother fuckers caught in that chain remain silent
So why you figure I've be standing here shaking
Because the devils is close to taking me but I can't face him (oooooh)
My soul is controlled by the blessings of god
Still scared to walk the first ground because the devil is in charge
Somebody help the lord soul find saviour
Cause I'm standing on the corner with a tech nine for the hole behaviour
They want to take me out the game like rider
But you youngstas better stop and peep game because my game wider
I send this out to thoose who thought that they cook
Cold as fuck when it came to the game and my game done
Southside south south side, south side south south side
south side south south side
South side south south side you know what I am saying</pre>
