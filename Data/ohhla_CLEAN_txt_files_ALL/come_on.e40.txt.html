Bitch I'm a hard head nigga
So don't ask me
I know a gang of motherfuckers say they gone blast me
Catch me dippin to some screw 
Attitude rude, drippin sweat, about to finger-fuck this tech
I leave em stretch reaching for a rifle 
Got him a pump before a nigga to duck to duck
I ain't no punk nigga this be mine for cease
before them chippers and cheese see we thieves

Give me some valiums and some Robitussin, watch me do it
Dip my cancer stick into some enbalming fluid
Show your I.D then pass it right back to me
cousin cause see I'm a minor 
and these wet daddies got your partner sweating like drippy ass vagina
Let me up in this bitch-ass club security or me and my guys
gon' bum rush these doors make it so it won't be no more rap shows
Yeah that's what I thought
I see wall to wall hoes bitches everywhere all over the place
Nigga ztippin off the green marble just so hoes can sit on the face

( Distorted "come on" )

A funky lesson number one My own don't be in no mess
Number two when it's confidential hold it on your chest
Number three ( three ) don't be fuckin with me 
Number four no more toe to toe
the only way to let these motherfuckers no is to flex
Wip they ass up leave em' bleeding like a Kotex
Boy we one tight knit ass clique
Niggas in my outfit don't be rattin
rollin over, snitchin, spillin beans, tattle-tellin

We be thievin, conniving they way that we surviving
No this bitch that's ballin and tonight's she's callin
Wantin to know " What's up B when we gone work it up"
If we can go kick it and smoke
Get her keyed as hell and maybe hit a hotel
I'm on my cell thinkin yeah I'm cool with that
Hit the Kit-Kat and get her sprees before I get he f cheese
Pimpin is a game and I'm lovin to flirt while my fingers up her tennis 
skirt

( Distorted "come on" repeats )

Bitch I'm dedicated you know, to this mob shit
Talk back , fuck that get your jaw split
Raw spit , that's what you niggas pay me for
A Hundred Thousand fuckin off down in Vegas Hoe 
And you know we the one to get the function bumpin
No shit we the clique bullshit ain't nothin
See you fuckin with some fools niggas with no rules
mobbin in they old schools bitch

????? With the windows up man with the heat on heat on
Man we in a land tacked out funked in a hamsac smokin on ????
I say it said producing rapping hustlin that's my bread and butter
You niggas better hurry up cause there's money in this motherfucker
(money in this moneyfucker)
Reverend is so hard to find like good boys
Cause shit be droppin have your ass
pissin yellow discharge taking tetracycline</pre>
