Song:   Get Body
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
Get your girl, get your glass, get body, body
Grab your man, it's your jam, get body, body
Get body, body, get raunchy, raunchy
When I say, get body, just party, party

[Inspectah Deck]
Toss shots like a shotty vay, hot over poppy doc
Hot offa bottle top, ma, I make your bottom drop
I can make the top rise, rise keep it king size
Packing cuz the heat rise, jacket and the jeans fly
Louis with the 1-3, son G, stun thee
Crack another Stoly, I can hold me, I'm my own G
I'm just trying to get my party party
Niggas hating, niggas watching like paparazzi
He try something stupid, get body body
Cuz that mob with me probably get raunchy raunchy
So, DJ play that song again, back to the floor again
Four in the morning and the doors still pouring in
Shorty with the forty inch, star struck, adoring him
Love it for the night, love, you never have all of him
Things be calling him, dope man, cross your ten
Fitted with the flaps, black and grey, three quarter Timbs
Everything they offer him, on the house, balling out
Walking out, with that redbone in the halter blouse

[Chorus 2X]

[Inspectah Deck]
Loose off the Goose and juice, louder, give the tune a boost
Ladies do the hula hoop, fellas show 'em who's the truth
Bounce, take it through the roof, jumping out your zoot suit
Ice cream flavors, misbehaving, I'mma scoop a few
Grown man, turn 'em out, fuck, what you heard about
Lean back, work it out, haters be the first to doubt
I'm just trying to get my party party
You can spot me at the bar with that Dark Bacardi
Yeah, ain't nobody gotta bodyguard me
My dudes got me if I leave the party wildly, now
Move if you feeling G, lean like you steer the V
Blaze it up, where's the P? Right here's where it be
Talk to me, what's the deal, fuck with me, cuz it's real
Let me get something clear, ya'll with me, up in here
Show me what you got then, homey, what you popping
Mami, getting body, just show me why you hopped in
DJ bring that record back, whole crowd sweating that
Throw it on, bet it crack, get involved, get your mack

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
