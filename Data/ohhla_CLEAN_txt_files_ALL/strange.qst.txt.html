[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Welcome to Strangeland come on down
Once you in my world man you can't get out
Murderous shit with an iLLified sound
Emerging out of the underground

[Verse 1]
Come into my world kid, welcome to Strangeland
Welcome to the mainland yeah this is the same man
That told the kids to kill somebody back a year ago
Here we go, thought I was going to quit that be a miracle
Serial Kill wit a bitta illa attitude
Show some gratitude, you don't want me gettin' mad at you
Had a few people say my music was a joke
The industry was clownin' me and I ain't losin' hope yo
They say the kind of rap I'm spittin' is a waste of talent
Quit the wicked shit and try to have more of a balance
Man Fuck you I wont change it's my land it's quite strange
I won't conform the victim and hope I do the right thing
It's my world, I ain't in this for the profit
If I succeed it'll be on my own or my shit
On my terms, wit my styles, wit my rhymes, it's my way
Fuck Fred Durst I'll throw his ass on the highway
In heavy traffic sociopathic bastard
Leavin people battered in caskets yeah that's it fantastic
That's how we be doin' things down in Strangeland
Where whack emcee's gettin' more props than a stagehand

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I be gettin' slept on like a futon
Whack cats makin bread and I ain't even makin' croutons
You couldn't save yourself even if you had a coupon
Now relish when I catch your best
Name me the great pupon
Through the Bentley window to the window of a hearse
What could be worse than strange place and a curse?
I'm the first at burst the way you horror kids disperse
To hop onto the latest trend I'll still rip a verse
Of these abstract, abstruse, abnormal rhymes
I'm simpleising your mind, and I will rein sublime
It's subliminal you can't replicate the original
I replenish return and my reply is reprehensible
It's unquestionable that my intellect's intact
You wanna integrate with my crew, too bad you whack
You profess to be proficient the prognosis of horrific
You pretend to make a profit off of insufficient lyrics
I wont hear it, you can copy me and try to make a mockery
Of sloppy D none a yall cats are stoppin' me
The Strange is one step in the emcee cipher
This is Strangeland my name ain't D. Sneider
The strange the lyricist emerging out the abyss
No radio hits, just sick shit like this
Fuck ya platinum only plaque I got is on my teeth
Lyrics so strange they confuse Kool Keith
Strange, like unexplained, unsolved mysteries
Graphic, violent, oozing with misery
(Is it me or is this emcee sound strange)
I'm on stage, covered in stains, wearin timberlands and Hanes
Fucked up deranged mad tapped in the brain
Take ya name, add the lame infesting with shame
Bring it to the battle when its time to throw down
You couldn't make the band even if your name was O town
Lets go now, there's no hope for you to even tryin' this
I wouldn't know defeat even if I'm a podiatrist
Mad scientist in the lab hopin' that you die and shit
But not before you all stop buyin' this

[Chorus] - 1.5X

Your in my world now
Welcome to Strangeland
Once you come in you never come out

This is my world
This is my house
This is my land
Think this is gonna stop? Hell No
Comin' back with that new shit
Infesting your fucking brain like a fucking maggot
Welcome to Strangeland...</pre>
