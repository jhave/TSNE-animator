[Intro]
Wassup?
Hahaaa
Yeah! Yes! It's real talk, can I talk to y'all for a minute?
I was in the streets the other day, I had a homie come through and he ask me
Say "Yo! Everybody listen to you, everybody all ears, what you gonna do to give back?"
I told him "Look homie, I'm ten steps ahead of you, if not thirty"
Real talk, listen up, I got one song, let's make it right, let's go

[Verse 1]
I'm high on life and a fifth of Remy
From the city where them young niggas die skinny
Keep work on deck if you need any
Just holler at them boys cause they keep plenty, follow me!
Got the weight of the world on my shoulders
And I swear it feels like ten thousand boulders
And it's so heavy, but I'm so ready
Feels like I was born for this
If not, at least I'll die for it
They said I couldn't do it but I'll still try for it
The big question is what can I do for the youth?
Everybody lyin to 'em so I told 'em the truth

[Hook]
"I'm a hustler!" So, one man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night
And I think I know the way, follow me
"I got hustle!" One man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night
And I think I know the way, follow me
"I'm a hustler!"

[Verse 2]
Real niggas don't die, they go to the Feds
Fresh out, right back chasin bread
My life's so hard, so concrete
I was raised by 'em homie, that's why I think so street
Take me for instance
My life is not about you, think me for instance
I did the impossible, I made it out
Got dealt a bad hand but I played it out
I'm a left lane nigga, my life's so fast
Now I'm thinking holmes, got my right blinker on
Spread my word, got my Kirk Franklin on
Stuntin in traffic like "This my car"
Sometimes I wonder how I made it this far
Life's a bitch so I'm tryna wife her
Just ball around, you know, buy her some things
Lovin every minute of it, still breakin chains

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Y'all my brush, let me paint a perfect picture
Gotta pay attention cause it's three dimensional
Same picture, see it one of three ways
Let it marinate, it might take a few days
They say all I talk about is drugs and violence
So I shouldn't say nothin? Get a moment of silence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense
Words to live by, took it out of context
They say your pass is your present and your present is your cash
So I look forward to the future
Get a lil' paper your baby momma won't have
Partly cloudy so I need a forecast
Where's the weatherman at when you need him?
A hungry nigga eat anything you feed him
A rich nigga will buy anything you sell him
And a broke nigga believe anything you fuckin tell him
