[Inspectah Deck]
Come out your clothes, legs in the air
Give it to me raw, bout face in the chair
Looking so good, I swear
I might not make it to the room, I'mma take it right here
Can't focus, hand on your tits
Backyard clap, handcuffs on your wrist
Nothing that can handle the diss
Girl, you take it like a pro, with your hands on your lips
Butt out your weave when I please ya
We gon' bring down the house like Steve &amp; Latifah
Act like you want it honey
Just one stroke from the rod, you be walking funny
And you don't really want to love me
Tap that ass so right, that you offer money
Take it like a champ, it's more than lovely
Take 'em to the bed when it's call me lovely

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck (Hedonis)]
She like that ghetto love, hardcore, hair pull from the back
(That rated X love, keep it up, while I ride your lap)
I make you sweat, love (dont stop) how you like it that
Give it to me, girl, don't make a scene (give it to me, boy, I make you scream)

[Hedonis]
Uh, ride rough, whips and the handcuffs, you don't really want H to
tell you what
In a birthday suit, all amped up, seen me, now smile for the cameras
Say cheese on your knees, don't you know a woman I need
This world we live in now, suck it up
Want a world watch, player tear it up
Scared of what I added up, chick from nine to ten
Better than the sex, is who gon' win, we at it again, yeah
From the bed to the floor, til the camera touch
Show me what you got, now you on top
Go deep like I just got shot
Bout to turn in my mouth, boy
Work-work-work that bad bone and let it all out cuz mami ain't home
Who's that bitch calling your phone, I'm grown, I'll slice a chick
Matter fact, who's pipe is it, it's tight as shit
Sexy chick, you found the right now, got two holes, you got to like one

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
Grind on my lap, spinap tap
Baby gon' wind it behind it that
Squat like Tae Bo, side to back
Bring it to the front, now ride it back
Never mind the sack, get inside the track
From the bed to the floor I'mma ride the cat
Throw it back like you don't know how to act
Wanna hit from the side til it's time to nap

[Hedonis]
Uh, last night I had a ball, should of been on the alcohol
Have you ever had a chick this tall, made 'em beg for he dropped his drawers
Sucked so much it gave him lockjaw, me play shit, he play straw
Take away like a U Haul, yeah, cause shots like a pool hall, rack 'em up
Uh, why you acting up, hit your breaks, I'm backing up
Make shit cut, cut the malt liquor, off the page of all I'm made
To the miles house thugs get made, can't play a chick like an arcade
They said, keep the news on the mission
Hot box, and got it detention

[Chorus]</pre>
