Mr. President, there would be one level of disclosure for the Congress,
is that correct?
One level of disclosure for the public...

[ crowd ]
Imprison the President
Incarcerate the Congress
Levitate the Pentagon
(Now we're making progress)

Imprison the President
Incarcerate the Congress
Levitate the Pentagon
(Now we're making progress)

[ VERSE 1: Laquan ]
A Senate cheat, what a feat to beat
Four mill until you buy the seat
Illicit contributions
Political prostritution
Looking for that fix
Peddle influence until it sticks
Are they funds or are they bribes?
I'm talkin about the Keating Five
The Senators are gettin paid off
So Lincoln won't get laid off
The banks are bankrupt
The Congress corrupt
What I don't get is the Federal bet
Two hundred billion in debt
Damn, that's enough to get a nigga upset
What I'm stating is incriminating evidence
Imprison the President

(Well, I do not recall [..]
I have no recollection
I do not recall
I do not recall)

[ crowd ]
Imprison the President
Incarcerate the Congress
Levitate the Pentagon
(Now we're making progress)

(Listen to them lying muthafuckas [..]
[..] a man that's a retired actor run a country?)

Imprison the President

[ VERSE 2: Laquan ]
Congress spoke, slaveowners vote
A joke if you ask my folks
All men are created equal and stated 
Equal, then contemplated
Best-seller fiction to the people
Yo, I can't wait to read the sequel
The people tell me this is phony
Giving your testimony, homie
They had to use, abuse, a low blow
1990 and still flying Jim Crow
Using Willie Horton for the fight
Frighten whites on election night
A thousand points of light, right?
The glare is bright and there's still no sight
Remember 83 in Panama?
A tip and trip from the drug czar
Summit with Bush and Noriega
Classic Coke is what they gave ya
Fly em in via CIA
Chumped from up above as they say
Start a war, yo, what the hell for?
Take him out, he won't talk no more
What I'm stating is incriminating evidence
Imprison the President

[ VERSE 3: Laquan ]
I diss, dismiss what I choose to lose
The attitude is funk it while I'm swingin the blues
Self-worth ain't worth shit
While I'm starin down a big black federal pit
You know Reagan can break the law
Live another day to make a score
Phony cronies steal from HUD
Iran-Contra, political mud
Who can respect the legal system
When any Senator can put the fix in
Every Congressman gets his licks in
And in the White House still sits Dick Nixon
Flase prophets and demagogues
Living large while the people starve
Famous speeches can't do jack
When down the block you're under attack
Preach hatred, preach salvation
Fifteen secs, a media sensation
Go ahead, juice the poets of revolution
Now's the time for some hard solutions
So many answers lie in yourself
So don't go following someone else
Learn and teach your own damn evidence
Imprison the President
Imprison the President
