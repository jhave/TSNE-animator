Typed by: CnoEvil@Wu-Lyricz.Com

    "He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"

[Inspectah Deck]
He don't really dance in the club, sip passion for thugs
Head bobbin', one hand on the slug
Wit a centerfold, head to toe, dress to kill
Wit his shit spillin' out the S6 pills
But he don't trick or spend presidents, basic
He's so sick, he's a resident patient

    "He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"

[Inspectah Deck]
He move wit a too live crew, white Nike shoe
Slidin' through, eyein' them boys through the rear view
He shine like chrome 25's
On the street, like a low ride, he don't hide
Seen wit the finest of queens, in designer jeans
Treat 'em like Midas the King, though he treat 'em mean

    "He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
No, he don't care how you feel
No, he don't care what's your name
No, he don't care who you wit
No, he don't care what you say
(Ain't this bullshit, try your luck
Cuz he don't give a flyin' fuck!)

    "He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"

[Inspectah Deck]
He's only got about four friends
You know him, probably got drugs in both Timbs
Boppin' on hard blocks, at large wit the cops
His song rock in nail saloons and barbershops
He talks of life and commands the set
He walks up right and demands respect

    "He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"

[Inspectah Deck]
He don't care what they (fuck is they?)
He hot like a summer day up in the Bay
A child of the ghetto, he fought through everything
And still "undisputed" like Wesley and Ving
Baggy jeans, two tone boots and big leathers
Certified live and his name is Inspectah

    "He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"

[Chorus]

    "He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"

[Inspectah Deck]
He stand out the packs, son spit the iller bars
And smoke chocolate weed and vanilla cigars
He a sexist, only need birds for one thing
Got a fetish, for shorty to work the tongue ring
The cool one, he live like a web cam
Not a follower, gopher or yes man

    "He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"

[Inspectah Deck]
He got missiles, to turn your block to dust
He got issues, he'd rather not discuss
And he posts up, low in the cut with his drink on
Linked on, mami in pink, wit the mink on
He a two time felon and parolee
Made man mobbin' like Vinny and Tony

    "He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"

[Chorus]

    "He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and" (3X)</pre>
