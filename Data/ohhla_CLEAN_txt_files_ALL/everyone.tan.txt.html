[Tanto]
Yo! I'm just giving out sounds
Every day yuh get up and a frown
A one ting mi want you know little girl
A one ting mi want yuh know, who

[Devonte] (Tanto)
Everyone falls in love sometime
(Cha cha, ya betta know, you betta know)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
(It's not a crime, it's not a crime)
Everyone falls in love sometime
(Remember that girl)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime

[Tanto]
Hold on de question I'll ask
Tell me what you want and what you really really wanna do
Tell me baby girl if your love is really really true
Tell me what you want and what you really really wanna do
Tell me baby girl eh, and don't have mi like no yo yo
If ya really love me let it flow flow
And if you don't love then let me go go
But any rude boy will let you know, know that

[Devonte] (Tanto)
Everyone falls in love sometime (Cha cha)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
(It's not a crime)
Everyone falls in love sometime (Honey)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime

[Tanto]
Ah ah hold on de, hold on de, hold on de
Hold on de, hold on de, hey
Beep beep, the singer got the keys to the jeep
A we pretty gal want fe meet
So tell me what's up before mi hit in the streets
Ya see, ya see, all eight, nine, ten
The whole a dem girl deh want fi be our friend
A you mi really love why you want it fi end
You have mi brains a puzzle, mi can't comprehend
But den again?

[Devonte]
Everyone falls in love sometimes (Oh na na)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime

Everyone falls in love sometime
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime

[Tanto]
Hey you wanna tell me yuh something girl
Yuh want mi tell you something?
Cho, girl you have me reminscing
When mi 'member 'bout you're loving and kissin
So tell me tell me girl, why you wanna be dissing
I try to talk to ya, but you're not listening
It's only natural for my love to be glistening
Baby in my heart I know there's something missing
Since lately you keep on flippin'
So listen keenly to what the singer singing

[Devonte] (Tanto)
Everyone falls in love sometime
(oh yeah yeah)
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
(It's not a crime, not a crime, not a crime)
Everyone falls in love sometimes
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime

[Tanto]
Hold on,  hold on
Question I'll ask
Tell me what you want and what you really really wanna do
Tell me baby girl if your love is really really true
Tell me what you want and what you really really wanna do
Tell me baby girl eh, and no have mi like no yo yo
If ya really love me let it flow flow
And if you don't love me let me go go
One ting de rude boy will let you know, know that

[Devonte] (Tanto)
Everyone falls in love sometime (I know)
I don't know bout you but it ain't a crime (Yeah now)
Everyone falls in love sometime
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime

[Tanto]
Me can say something to you again girl?
Me can say something to you again?
Beep beep, the singer got the keys to the jeep
A we pretty gal want fe meet
So tell me what's up before make hit in the streets
Ya see, ya see, all eight, nine, ten
The whole a dem gal deh want fi be my friend
A you mi really love why you want it fi end
You have mi brains a puzzle, mi can't comprehend
But den again?
