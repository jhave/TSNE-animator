Is everybody on the same page?
Is it safe to say we're all sick and tired of living this way?
Sick of swallowin' lies, sick of followin' trends
Sick of swallowin' pride, sick of followin' them
Tired of falling in line, not speaking your minds
Tired of askin why, and gettin no reply
Try to keep the drive
Seems so hopeless right?
Anything is possible if you and I ?corrage?

There's a life they seek in you
Despite you when I'm ?Loo?
Lifes the inner few, gotta fight for me and you
It's like the western view, we rest and never move
Sip the nectars brew, and enjoy the better view
Cause who's gonna say it?
Come on, who's gonna be the one?
Who's gonna make it happen?
Who's gonna save us from...us?
When the time comes, when the time runs out
Let the crowd die down, everyone gather round

[Chorus]
Are we gonna take it? No
Not for a damn thing
Not for anybody
And not for any reason
Then how we gonna make it? (make it)
When no one even cares? (even cares)
Aren't you tired of being patient? (Yeah!)
Stand strong and be prepared (be prepared)

Stop, take a minute off and I can just
drop everything thats got you trippin its not
A great commitment of times and we've got
To get ourselves realigned
Each day we wake, same old mistakes
Keep on this pace, or lose this place
We choose to make, this life this way
And despite the stakes, still live as slaves
Behave as though outside a window
Not in this rows of roads, littered with condo's
City lights that glow, a bitter light composed
of lost souls, dyin souls who profit off our woes.

Oh hey now, I kinda like the way your faith sounds
Play aloud and give me time to wind the day down
Stay around awhile and we can sit about
and talk speak your mind let it out and we can set it off
Just get it off your chest, fuck stayin' depressed
Put it all to rest, and rise about your nest
Don't settle for less, come on make some noise
Renovate the mess, and let me hear your voice

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
