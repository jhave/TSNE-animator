[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Turn it up {*3X*}
Just turn it up
Go on turn it up
Just turn it up
Ha ha... TURN IT UP!!

[Lil Wayne]
No regrets at all
I'm high and I hope you catch the fall
Welcome to my lecture hall
You can't shake my infection off
Take me to your leader and
I promise I will be the man
Swim until I see the sand
Then die soon as I reach the land
The water's over our hands
What happened to our plans?
Swim until I see the sand
Then die soon as I reach the land!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
This is my resurrection, so fuck yo' resolution
I don't need no protection, I don't need your confusion
Don't know what to believe {*3X*}
Don't care what you believe
Cause I'm so over you, yeah I'm so over you
Yeah I fly over you, cause I'm so over you

[Shanell]
I did everything by the book - book (book) book (book)
Scribblin all over all of the notes that I took (took) took (took)
Find that you're no better than a crook... OOH
Set and developed I felt I could trust you... struck
Showed them a picture of my ID
That's not enough to prove that it's me
Look in the mirror, now who should I be... lieve

[Chorus] w/ Shanell

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Ha!
Don't know what to believe (uhh)
Don't know what to believe (yeah)
Don't know what to believe (huh)
Don't care what you believe (yeah)
Don't know what to believe (uhhhh)
Don't know what to believe (yeaaaaah)
Don't know what to believe (waaaaahhhhh)
Yeah!!! Uhh</pre>
