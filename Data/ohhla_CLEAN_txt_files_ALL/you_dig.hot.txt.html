[Mannie Fresh]
Dude there's three things that I love in life
Hot dog, hot ride and Hot muthafuckin Boyz

[Juvenile]
I was standin on the muthafuckin corner, you dig
Head buzzin cuz I'm rolling marijuana, you dig
My lil cousin keep on asking me for money, you dig
I'm looking at her crazy cuz I think it's funny, you dig
Could have got yoself a job, or else do something, you dig
Baggin pennies minimum wage is better than nothing you dig
Some black folk got too much pride that's why they struggling, you dig
Gotta get up off yo ass and start to hustle, you dig
I don't wanna live that life no more, I'm chillin, you dig
I got a plan to be the man and make a million, you dig
I got a problem with some niggaz that be stealing, you dig
But it's all gravy, I know I'm gon sell a million, you dig
I told my momma I'm a put you in a mansion, you dig
Cash Money Records done made an expansion, you dig
We be in the studio, working like dogs, you dig
One day we gon do this it's gonna be off, you dig

[Chorus]  
You know what he talking bout, that boy, that nut nice
You know what he talking bout, fuck wit him lose yo life
You know what he talking bout, that boy Juve a fool
You know what he talking bout, nigga act like you cool
You know what he talking bout, that boy, that nut nice
You know what he talking bout, fuck wit him lose yo life, you know...

[Juvenile]
I been looking for a way out for too long, you dig
That's why right now, I be writing song after song, you dig
Niggaz done gave me the green light you know it's on, you dig
Believe you gon hear Juvenile after he gone, you dig
Ain't got no beef wit no other rapper and it's cool, you dig
But if you fucking wit me I might act a fool, you dig
I don't want it go there but I got a 2, you dig
Hey I'm sittin in my (?) but I gotta move, you dig
I battle for my son, I gotta plan, you dig
I be on blocks where niggaz straight up bust yo head, you dig
Nobody gon run they mouth because they scared, you dig
They no me and that ain't gon stop me from gettin paid, you dig
I ain't worried about nuttin, I'm on my own, you dig
I can handle all of my buisness from my phone, you dig
Wit all this right shit how can I go wrong, you dig
I be banging just like my daddy just cause I'm strong, you dig

[Chorus]  
You know what he talking bout, that boy, that nut nice
You know what he talking bout, fuck wit him lose yo life
You know what he talking bout, that boy Juve a fool
You know what he talking bout, nigga act like you cool
You know what he talking bout, that boy, that nut nice
You know what he talking bout, fuck wit him lose yo life, you know...

[Verse 3]
I'm from the ghetto where everybody be broke, you dig
That don't mean that I'm might turn my back on my folks, you dig
Muthafuckaz be in my face cuz they be hatin, you dig
Muthafuckaz think I'm a chump but they mistakin, you dig
Nigga disrespectin the Juvie I can take it , you dig
Ain't a problem I run away from, I gotta face it, you dig
If a bitch get outta line I'm a replace her, you dig (replace her)
Nigga like me run into a lot of faces, you dig
I know them women out there be looking for paper, you dig (what, what)
I'm a bad nigga fill em wit the amazin, you dig
Probably get my paper chase on just like (?), you dig
They think I'm not about my paper, better watch it, you dig
Fuckin and buyin women got me stunted, you dig
You see the Cash Money family, you know we comin, you dig
I only play out with this music because I wanna, you dig
And when I get my fucking BENZ I'm gonna flaunt it, you dig

[Chorus]  x2
You know what he talking bout, that boy, that nut nice
You know what he talking bout, fuck wit him lose yo life
You know what he talking bout, that boy Juve a fool
You know what he talking bout, nigga act like you cool
