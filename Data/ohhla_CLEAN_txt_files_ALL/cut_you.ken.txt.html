[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh-uh, uh
Ali, you thirsty on Twitter {*laughs*}
You boo-boo, you T
You turned down, you thirsty
You boo-boo

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings
and if I speak the good into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed
like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like, and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney &amp; Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
to the car she drove last year, or who fucking on who
and who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch, I'ma cut you off

[Chorus]
Cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... hoe
Every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
or at least inquire similar desires
to do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making enemies my nigga
Oh, that's not your memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
on how much you well connected like centipedes my nigga?
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed him at the Monte Crystal
Where so-and-so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on something with some substance that can get us both paid
rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off

[Chorus]
Cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... scary ass
Every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa, studying art
Now paint that picture, life behind bars
Remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed, them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For fifteen years no one paid, him attention but moms
Yeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people, dang
And if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would probably cut y'all off, too, yep

[Chorus]
Cause every time you come around y'all be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... keep it running Ali
Every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say

[Kendrick Lamar]
So tell 'em shut the fuck up
Tell 'em shut the fuck up
Yeah bitch you boo-boo, you T
You turned down, you thirsty
Tell 'em shut the fuck up
Tell 'em shut the fuck up
Yeah nigga you boo-boo, you T
You turned down, you thirsty
You thirsty, you boo-boo
You T, you turned down
You boo-boo, you T
You boo-boo, you turned down
You thirsty, you T
You boo-boo, you turned down
You boo-boo, you T
You turned down, you weak
You weak, yo' bitch weak
Yeah {*laughs*}
You boo-boo, you T {*laughs*}
Keep all that

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
What is HiiiPoWeR?
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
See it's known today that the human race is nothing
No moral, no standards
What we're about to do is raise the level of expectations
No you don't have to have a lot of money
You don't have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it's as big as a crew, some say it's as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it's as big as a religion</pre>
