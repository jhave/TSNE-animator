Uh-huh, you know where I'm takin this
I'm takin it right there - they leave me no choice
AOWWWWW!! Uh, uh, oh

[Verse One]
She said she was a model for a year and a half
And if she took her pins out, 
then her hair would drop down to her calf
I knew her man, he was just up North
and would've got left up North, but he was the chef up North
Anyway I'm K-I-double
All I do is get dough, spit flows, try to stay out of trouble
If you ready we could move, just lose your man
or hit the dance floor, I'll show you how to do my dance
Or I might let you play in the garden
Or sit up in that white thing and listen to the greatest of Marvin
The estate got six locations
Take so long to get to the front once I missed probation
And I hate to brag
I know ya man really wouldn't like the Beretta but he'd hate the Mag
And yeah here go a blank check, rock yourself out
But in the mean time girl - knock yourself out

[Chorus]
Oh you modelin momma? (knock yourself out)
Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)
Oh you ready to move? (knock yourself out)
Whatchu wanna sit in the Coupe? (knock yourself out)
Wanna keep on dancin? (knock yourself out)
Wanna run in my mansion? (knock yourself out)
Sit in V.I.P.? (knock yourself out)
Bitch you just wanna be seen (knock yourself out)

[Verse Two]
Now you can knock yourself out like you boxin yourself
Or you can get real freaky start poppin yourself
And my watch got so many rocks, when you look at the time
it's sorta like you watchin yourself, uhh
Front if you want, I puff a few blunts
and take a cruise in a Porsche wit the trunk in the front
She had the Jocko B'sure sandals, told her hop in
The coupe blew her mind when she couldn't find the door handles
Attitude very high maintence; check this out ma
I'm runnin out of my patience
Don't sleep wit me? Then don't speak wit me
And neva talk bad bout niggaz that eat wit me

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Aiyyo, honey know I'm waitin to leave
Keep dancin, cause I like how that ass shake in them capris
I'm like Big wit the murder mamis up in Belize
but I'll still fuck a chickenhead like Lil' Cease
I don't care if they model, bet they all gon' chill
First nigga to cook base on a Foreman grill
And you might win some, but you just lost one
Kiss +Miseducates+ 'em like Lauryn Hill

[Chorus] - (Fades)</pre>
