Music first..
Grand Puba - "Step up front!"
Ahh, Milk Dee - "Step up front!"
A Priority Posse - "Step up front!"
To my mom and my dad - "Step up front!"
Uhh, c'mon.. yeah, c'mon..
Yeah baby c'mon.. uh, c'mon..

[Verse One]
Let's discuss this - listen while I bust this
It's from the K, so hey you can trust this
rhyme ritual rap my rap spiritual
Pumpin and jumpin, from the max to the minimum
I don't moan and groan, I take it on
For floozies I bone I just leave 'em alone
I need a clear head in order for me to win it
so baby, "Hold up - hey! Wait a minute!"

Uhh, yeah.. uhh, c'mon..
Yeah baby c'mon now.. uhh, c'mon..

[Verse Two]
On the square - I'm not riffin like Andy Griffith
Just fed up, goin head up, with competition
Don't excluse or place no restriction
Gotta qualify to be in my jurisdiction
Razzle, dazzle, burn you to a frazzle
Soon you say you don't need the hassle
I'm too hard to be soft, too loud to be a duck
And if you are well then look tough luck
It's not your world so don't work at no resentment
Tryin to front on a three-hour rap segment
I'm the one so FUCK your attitude
I got a chip on my shoulder, plus I'm in a bad mood
You're huffin, puffin, bluffin for nothin
Come out your face, word is bond I hurt somethin
Rockin your knot, puttin a wop in your bop
Hittin the spot, just like an insulin shot
So whassup Hobbes?  I'm all in it
"Hold up - hey! Wait a minute!"

Yeah.. uhh, yeah baby c'mon..
Uh, c'mon..

[Verse Three]
Well uhh, boom batter, sissies don't matter
Sorry homeboy my pockets is gettin fatter
The chain gets thicker, the records come quicker
Your girl keeps comin around I'm gonna stick her
So plan your prevention I'm the best in your dimension
Don't cause static and I don't like tension
Cellophone sissies - I see through ya
Every rhyme you say I'll outdo ya
I'm an MC please I'm not a microphone teaser
Got more rhymes than meat in your freezer
So don't debate it, or complicate it
Appreciate the fact new jacks, I made it
Yeahhhh boy, believe it's true
What I've done many wants to do
My rhymes are sufficient, also suffice
No matter how you put it they're plain just nice
Takes time to be written, pull fully intact
I never had to front I got too much back
Well I said things changed ever since I got in it
so, "Hold up - hey! Wait a minute!"

Uhh, if it ain't rough it ain't right
If it ain't loose it's tight
and if it ain't black it's white
So c'mon, maintain your aggression
and use some discretion
And I'ma get wreck in just about onnnnnnnne second

[Verse Four]
Positive, the gentleman, the rapper
Intelligent, clean cut, dapper
Blowin out scales on the rhyme barometer
Raisin temperatures upon the hip-hop thermometer
Commercial - controversial's not my image
I'm roughin up rappers just like a, football scrimmage
Put 'em to a test, see what they can commit
And if they can't take an order like my dog - sit!
Girls I want - yeah I can get 'em
Shakespeare?  Couldn't shoot a rap better
Got a way with words, that could seduce you
When you find out honey, you just got loose
Word to the mother, mother to the word
It's not absurd by what you just heard
I rock 'em, wrote 'em, long like a totem pole
Baby God bless your soul
I choose 'em, flooze 'em, bang 'em, bruise 'em
Send 'em to the next man then I excuse 'em
I'm the Positive, not the interrogative
with a lot to take and a hell of a lot to give
But umm, people changed ever since I got in it so
"Hold up - hey! Wait a minute!"

Uhh, yo I wanna say whassup to the crew
To Audio Two, and MC Lyte
Also the Alliance
And to the Hillside Posse, yo we outta here!
But c'mon on.. yeah, c'mon now..
Yeah baby c'mon.. uhh, c'mon..
Yeah..</pre>
