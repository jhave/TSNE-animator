[Raekwon]
Aiyo, Rockstars, bases and capers flying through cases
With placed bread, lead blowing through domes, scalped faces
Moving through towns, skama lit, nations bend stations
Dope fiend Asians, smoke cream vanquishes
The town is thirsty for work, blood hurting
Flash the curtain, open, I'm scoping, Hutch and his team
Clutching Dutches Backwoods, other shits working, not perfect
Flipping discussions, cussing all froze with slush, kid
Lacer had the drop, pass the glock, Woosie uzi
The car hard bluesy with the pay me mean 'Bach
Cream shot, clean slot, one in his dome, four shock
He partially zoned, his dome fell on the rock
His face dazzle, niggas baffle, son, hit the floor, he traveled
Yo, to a new land, I cracked his cerebellum
Wide open, open the crowd up, he fouled up, black laid in the hall
For like forty-five to an hour, soaking

[Chorus: Thea Van Seijen]
Sound of the smoking barrel, live like them older stars
Scrooge like a Christmas Carol, stemmed from a bloody love
Shot through the old apparel, no police to respond
Dropped off the Verrazano, washed up On Golden Pond
Just like a Shakespeare novel, more problems to dissolve
If this is destiny, that's how this world resolve

[Inspectah Deck]
Aiyo, it's real, better pop your steel, cop those wheels, shop those deals
Full time with the grind for a meal, stay down low like O'Neal
Rain, hail, snow or shine, put time on the field, police ride on my heels
Still big time, big dime, how you feel, I rhyme but the nine stay peel
I, zone on roam, floss with the chrome on chrome, host on the corner store
S.I.N.Y. on my own, it gets foul, but I call it home
Live red bone give me dome, champagne toast to Tone
Roll a bone, a homegrown with Capone
Cause more rips to the o-zone, wanna ride with a nigga then hold on

[GZA]
The place was very smokey and cloudy, the full lousy
Music was emotional, people vibes was laid back and far from rowdy
She sit at the bar, holding a glass, sipping on a drink
Tears flowing like water from a sink, her eyes never blink
Her cigarette was burnt to the butt, her wrist was wearing a cut
Her facial expression was saying "now what"
Another drink was made, each and every time the bass was played
Bartender telling her to go, but then she only stayed
Riding on the borderline, between homicidal, suicidal
Just hours from the headlines, the story with the grim title
She questioned her reason for being here, but even with
Four kids at home alone, it still remains unclear
Opens up a bottle of prescribed drugs and grabs a mug
Down, every one of those pills, since she was feeling bugged
Kinda weak, she stumbled from her seat, but she will never return
I guess it must of been a, lesson to learn
