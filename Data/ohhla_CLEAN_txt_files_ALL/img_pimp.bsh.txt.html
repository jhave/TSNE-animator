(Yeah, Yeah, Uhh)
It's such a filthy game
Such a dirty game
The game don't eva change
My image is everything

[Chorus: translated to English]
You know my image as a pimp, it can be kind of hard to ignore
Because of my image, I might call you a whore
You know my image as a pimp, it can be hard to accept
You gotta be open for some disrespect

[Baby Bash]
Word around town is I pop these P's
Word around town is I hold these G's
Word around town is I blow these trees
Word around town is Baby Beesh
Pimpin' in high velocity, yall squares betta back up off me
Cuz we gonna do what the hell we do
Baby Bash the ghetto socrities
Gettin' all these keys at playa prices
Top notch ho by da name of Icess
Soak it up qick cuz da game is priceless
Money and mackin' is nuttin nice (b*tch)
Im out in Ohio man I missed my trial
Feds after me cuz I serve this D
Got blessed as Golden child

[Chorus]

[Oral Bee]
I dominate the ladies, insult the ladies
Some think that Oral Bee is badgering the ladies
I massage some ladies.but keep it on the hush
I'm a pimp, shit, I'm not supposed to have no crush
Met this lady, she was off the hook
A playa got hard off her sexy look
To my homies I said that she was crazy horny
And, like most bitches she was dumb and corny
Well, the truth is that this girl was mad intelligent
I wanted to follow her ass everywhere it went
Yes Suh! This mama turned me on
But then she met some slick-talkin playa and was gone
He was a nasty playa who called her a queen
Now, I can't do that, I am a pimp-machine
Sometimes I wish that pretty bitch still was mine
But, I got the image of a pimp, and I stay true to it all the time

[Chorus]

[Third verse]
Image of a pimp is what I got
Take a look at me girl I live it hard
I ain't chose to rhyme my game is cold
Million dollar mouth piece have you bringin doe
Back to the daddy in a candy caddy
Wit a half bag of afghanastani
Cuz me and Beesh see we blowin' big
Cant help us now cuz we on it
Ohh look we slammin' da bom on it
Dont act like yo ass ain't noticed it
I'm rollin' wit a bunch of hoggs
Y'all ready know they like to ball
I get paid fo sex give me the money on a daily basis
Have yo ass on the track till 8 in da morning
I'm a mack baby I ain't savin' h0s

[Chorus]

[Baby Bash]
Blow one..
Now what it do, what it do, it's ya smokin' nephew
What it do, what it do, it's ya smokin' nephew
What it do, what it do, it's ya smokin' nephew</pre>
