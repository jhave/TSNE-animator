[Intro: Smif-N-Wessun] (Sample from "Who Ya Wit?" by Jay-Z)
I just want you to (Feel me on this one, feel this)
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? (Feel me on this one, uh huh, yeah)
Can you? (Feel me on this one, uh!)
Fall back and just (Check the repertoire, uh huh)
I just want you to (Feel me on this one, feel this)
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? (Feel me on this one, yeah)
Can you? (Feel me on this one, feel this)
Fall back and, just (Check the repertoire)

[Verse One: Tek]
Bottle of Melou and the four fifth
Big beard tattooed face, who waan rip? 
You can be the genie in the bottle
Jack in the box, different than the model
I'm what the block made me
Defense impregnable, gun game crazy
Can't wait 'til the word get back
And I ensure I rise how ignorant the mack act
I stand chain out, with the flamer
If it don't kill ya, definetly name ya (YOU KNOOOOOWWWW!!!!)
I mean really do a number
Sit you down for a half if not the whole summer
My nephew asked if I wanna see him get like
(I align strong two g's) Until him get right
I fell asleep in the Porche behind the wheel
Woke up comin off the wall and that's real

[Chorus: Rock] (*Pete Rock Scratchin)
Yeah! I need you to feel me without hands on this one (DON'T TOUCH!)
This is really where I stand on this one (IT'S ALL LOVE)
If it ain't clear to land or get slumped
Got plans to get one check the repertoire ("That's-T-That's how I feel"-Audio Two)
I need you to feel me without hands on this one (DON'T TOUCH!)
This is really where I stand on this one (IT'S ALL LOVE)
If it ain't clear to land or get slumped
Got plans to get one check the repertoire ("T-T-That's how I feel"-Audio Two)

[Verse Two: Steele]
The rhyme gravel 'em high the mind travel
Defy Darryl your eye meet nine barrel
Like Shyne Barrow the cannon be under the camel
I'm focused, look into the eye of the sparrow
Drop vowels at rhyme battles
Snatch the crown of the king have crooks in your castles
Like Roy Harbs with a bat, duke I'm a natural
And my apparel is all black when I get at you
This rap is fire been rappin to void distract you
Pen to position I should write with a scalpel
The surgeon general carve lyrical statutes
And I'm original I ain't like other rap dudes 
Act rude, spit facts holdin my cashews
Cash flew I don't like rules guess I'm irrational
A jack ass too act new I'm a smack you
Ask who clapped? Just Smif-N-Wessun that's who 

[Chorus: Rock] (*Pete Rock Scratchin)
Yeah! I need you to feel me without hands on this one (DON'T TOUCH!)
This is really where I stand on this one (IT'S ALL LOVE)
If it ain't clear to land or get slumped
Got plans to get one check the repertoire ("That's-T-That's how I feel"-Audio Two)
I need you to feel me without hands on this one (DON'T TOUCH!)
This is really where I stand on this one (IT'S ALL LOVE)
If it ain't clear to land or get slumped
Got plans to get one check the repertoire ("T-T-That's how I feel"-Audio Two)

[Verse Three: Bun B]
It's just one man, one gun, one clip, one trigga
One second to die and that's comin from one nigga (Nigga!)
Stand back I'm the one man Delta Force
Wanna play cowboy that heater will melt ya horse (Horse!)
Pull up on a nigga block in a mail truck
Mailbag hangin with the nina and it well tucked (Tucked!)
Ring your doorbell package for signin
Soon as you open te door I'll split ya back with the nine (Nine!)
My vernacular shine so I ain't gotta wear the chain often (Nope!)
I'll crack ya hard ass head and let ya brain soften (Damn!)
Because my mama ain't raised no suckers (No suckers!)
Don't make me leave your forehead on your chuckers (Chuckers!)
Motherfuckers said a tornado hit Brooklyn (Brooklyn!)
Nah that was just me son but good lookin (Lookin!)
What you got cookin? (Cookin) Bitch nigga fricasseed 
Trill O.G. I give a fuck what a nigga say!!!

[Chorus: Rock] (*Pete Rock Scratchin)
Yeah! I need you to feel me without hands on this one (DON'T TOUCH!)
This is really where I stand on this one (IT'S ALL LOVE)
If it ain't clear to land or get slumped
Got plans to get one check the repertoire ("That's-T-That's how I feel"-Audio Two)
I need you to feel me without hands on this one (DON'T TOUCH!)
This is really where I stand on this one (IT'S ALL LOVE)
If it ain't clear to land or get slumped
Got plans to get one check the repertoire ("T-T-That's how I feel"-Audio Two)

[Verse Four: Rock]
'Cause this the mr. monster man Rocko, monster man Gotto
Don't try, monster man scar your fam pronto
Monster man hard to glam at you, hear me I pop toast
With a squad of marauders bangin all for that gwop though
I got crasah test dummies (Dummies!) that blast it for me (For me!)
Do anything I tell them 'bout some cash bread money (Money!)
Chad said he bummy (Bummy!) Now that nigga bummy fly
Fast cheddar comin in from Cuba you rep junkies high!
The beat body ya single the song slaughterer
So long suckers I do the same shit to all of ya (All of ya)
Handle the biscuit, animalistic, your man and your bitch
Get blammed in the hip, for ampin this shit, go 'head!
You feel lucky?! Go ahead approach the God
Video tape this shit for a episode of Scarred (EWWWWW!!!)
Niggas think they slick we more greasy 
Fuck a License To Ill my Boys Beastie!!!

[Chorus: Rock] (*Pete Rock Scratchin)
Yeah! I need you to feel me without hands on this one (DON'T TOUCH!)
This is really where I stand on this one (IT'S ALL LOVE)
If it ain't clear to land or get slumped
Got plans to get one check the repertoire ("That's-T-That's how I feel"-Audio Two)
I need you to feel me without hands on this one (DON'T TOUCH!)
This is really where I stand on this one (IT'S ALL LOVE)
If it ain't clear to land or get slumped
