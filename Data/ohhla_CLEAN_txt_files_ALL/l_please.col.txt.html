[Verse 1 - J. Cole]
Yeah, I had this little bad thing somethin like them tens
She gave a nigga made brain, somethin like The Wiz
But you see the sad thing fuckin with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her, about the world and about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like baby look at how we live broke on the Boulevard
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down for
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down for
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feeling we get knowin that pussy is ours
And how it, feels to feel that feeling you feeling when you be drillin that shit
Got her sayin you be killin that shit
And all the pain the world cause she be healin that shit
And nah that ain't your girl dog but you be feeling that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the mean time it's lights please, lights please, lights please

[Chorus - J. Cole]
Turn off the lights
For now everything just seem so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright, lights please, lights please

Turn off the lights
For now everything just seem so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright, lights please

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceiling
She say she wanna blow L's, I hear her and I'm willin
But every time I smoke well a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke, well I'm tryin to put her on
But she couldn't hear me, I told her all about how we have been living a lie
And that they love to see us all go to prison or die
Like baby look at how they show us on the TV screen
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it, she workin, jerkin it non-stop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip, I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin
I'm findin, the more I grow the more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules but yet y'all tryin to play the game
And ain't it shameful, how niggaz blame hos for givin birth
To a baby that took two to make, coward nigga you a fake
How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back
Then go start another family dog, what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recording tracks
Said I know you wanna change the world but for the night please
Just reach over and hit the lights please, lights please, lights please

[Chorus]

[Outro - J. Cole - talking]
Ah, uh uh, lights please
Ah, uh uh, lights please
Ah, uh uh, lights please
Turn off the lights, lights please</pre>
