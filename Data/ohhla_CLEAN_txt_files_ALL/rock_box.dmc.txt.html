[Run]
Run.. (Run..) D.. (D) M.. (M) C.. (C)
Rock.. (rock.. rock..)
For you! (for you.. for you..)
Fresh (fresh.. fresh..)

{*guitar solo*}

[Run]
For all you sucker MC's perpetratin a FRAUD
Your rhymes are cold wack and keep the crowd cold bored
You're the kind of guy that girl ignored
I'm drivin Caddy, you fixin a FORD
My name is Joseph Simmons but my middle name's Lord
and when I'm rockin on the mic, you should all applaud
Because we're (wheelin, dealin, we got a funny feelin)
We rock from the floor up the ceilin
We groove it (you move it) it has been proven
We calm the savage beast because our music is SOOTHIN
We create it (relate it) and often demonstrate it
We'll diss a sucker MC make the other suckers hate it
We're rising (suprising) and often hypnotizing
We always tell the truth and then we never slip no lies in
No curls (no braids) peasy-head and still get paid
Jam Master cut the record up and down and cross-fade

{*guitar solo*}

[Run]
Because the rhymes I say, sharp as a nail
Witty as can be and not for sale
Always funky fresh, could NEVER be stale

[D.M.C.]
Took a test to become an MC and didn't fail
I couldn't wait to demonstrate
all the super def rhymes that I create
I'm a wizard of a word, that's what you heard
And anything else is quite absurd
I'm the master of a mic, that's what I say
And if I didn't say that, you'd say it anyway

[Run]
Bust into the party, come in the place
See the first things come, the music in your face
Tears down the walls, some of the floor
with the DJ named Jay with the cuts galore

[D.M.C.]
So listen to this because it can't be missed
and you can't leave til you're dismissed
You can do anything that you want to
but you can't leave until we're through
So relax your BODY and your mind
and listen to us say this rhyme - HEY
You might think that you have WAITED
long enough til the rhyme was STATED
But if it were a test it would be GRADED
with a grade that's not DEBATED
Nothing too deep and nothing dense
and all our rhymes make a lot of SENSE

[Run-D.M.C.]
So move your butt, to the cut
Run amuk, you're not in a rut
Each and everybody out there, we got the notion

[D.M.C.]
We want to see y'all all in motion

[Run-D.M.C.]
Just SHAKE, WIGGLE jump up and down
Move your body to the funky sound

[D.M.C.]
Side to side, back and forth

[Run-D.M.C.]
We're the two MC's, and we're gonna go off
Stand in place, walk or RUN
Tap your feet, you'll be on the one

[D.M.C.]
Just snap your fingers and clap your hands

[Run-D.M.C.]
Our DJ's better than all these bands
HUH!!

{*Jam Master Jay cuts then instrumental breaks down*}

[Run]	We got all the lines
[DMC]	and all the rhymes
[Run]	We don't drop dimes
[DMC]	and we don't do crimes
[Run]	We bake a little cake with Duncan Hines
[DMC]	and never wear the vest they call the Calvin Kleins
[Run]	Cause Calvin Klein's no friend of mine
	Don't want nobody's name on my behind
	Lee on my legs, sneakers on my feet
	D by my side and Jay with the beat

[Run-D.M.C.] - (ad libbing to fade)
