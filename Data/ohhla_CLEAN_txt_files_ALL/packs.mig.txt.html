Song:   Packs
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
All kinda packs
I got a whole lot of that, all stupid packs
Roll it up, Migo team got them shooters

[Chorus x2: Quavo]
I got different kinda packs
All colored packs
Stupid flavored pack
Stanky Kush pack
Sour Diesel pack
Mango Kush pack
That gas, That gas

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I got Tony Tiger Kush with the orange hairs on it
I got Barney Kush, got the purple hairs on it
Which ever pack you need, yeah I got it if you want it
I got lean by the pint
That yellow all I drink
That money on my mind, it's the only thing I think
Got to vacuum seal the gas
Garbage can, yeah it stink
I just call up my Migo plug, he want a whole thing
Tell him meet me at the Texico, I'm in that orange thang
I should win a grammy the way I make them birds sing
The pack kicking hard, Mortal Kombat, Liu Kang
You can lock me in the kitchen where the fuck I do my thing
The crazy ass wrist boy, I make a hurricane

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I got Kush in my blunt, and it's lime green
Take out that Zippy, or the sticky, and that G-13
Riding in that Audi, got ten bowls of that Maui
Niggas out here in these streets, they Hungry Howie
Your BBS's ain't official they look cloudy
Hard top coup, but the inside Bounty
My lil Migo pull up on you, serve a couple brownies
Gotta strip the scene cause the block hot like a cauldron
Khaki foreign bad bitch, please excuse her manners
Straight drop dope, make the fiends go bananas
I get the zip, ship, then cost me 180
On the block for a minute flip one for 380

[Chorus x2]
