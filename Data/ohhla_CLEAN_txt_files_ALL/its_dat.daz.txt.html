[Intro]
Ahhh shit (woo!)
Yeah, you know we up in this motherfucker
You know what I mean?
Dogg-motherfuckin'-house

[Chorus]
You can't tell me shit, get pistol whipped
Fuck what you say, it's the gangsta shit
We the gangsta click, kickin' gangsta shit
Fuck what you say, get pistol whipped

[Daz Dillinger]
Put your khaki's and your blue rags and your Chuck's on
It's Dat Nigga Daz, we rollin' in a black Brougham
Rollin' just gettin' domed
Just like a packed tail nigga, cause I got to roam
Holdin' my own, step the wrong way, you'll get blown
CHA-POW nigga, you're gone
Look out - stoned out, bombed out
With the niggaz, we run my neighborhood with major clout
On this - paper route, street grindin'
Blindin' y'all niggaz when we thug it out
Rip it out, dip it out, shippin' it all out
Nigga we outta here
We stone cold fools, for the cream
Supreme team, with billion dollar dreams
With trillion dollar schemes
With a infra-blue beam
Stickin' and whippin' niggaz just for cream
See I'm a Dogg Pound mobster, boogie monster
Chest stomper, Dat Nigga Daz always into somethin'
Here you go, you hear my bass bumpin'
Stompin', like N.W.A. I'm into somethin'
HA HA, see, the boys in the hood is way too hard
21st, the loc'est nigga on the boulevard

[Chorus]
You can't tell me shit, get pistol whipped
Fuck what you say, it's the gangsta shit
We the gangsta click, kickin' gangsta shit
Fuck what you say, get pistol whipped

[Crystal]
This gang bangin' ain't stoppin'
'Fore you know it I'll be up on the top
Ballin' way outta control whether you like me or not
I'm silky smooth with the gangsta groove, I'll make you move
Don't give a fuck what you say, that's just my attitude
On the West, bitches don't play that shit
Nigga bounce, gotta ounce?, nigga blaze that shit
Ah shit, bitches wanna play me for a fool
So I - act a fool, I'm too hot to keep cool
They wanna know where I got it, don't worry 'bout shit
Just know I'm 'bout that 'bout it
If a bitch blow up in this game, don't doubt it
Eliminatin' bitch niggaz cause the game's too crowded
If you see me blast off like a heat seeker, hummin'
If the earth started shake, you know I'm comin'
Runnin' shit, like it's s'posed to be
I'm takin' off on any trick tryin' to get close to me

[Daz Dillinger]
*CHA-POW*
(shoot 'em, shoot 'em up)
Up jump the boogie to the boogie
To bang bang to the boogie, bang bang
(shoot 'em, shoot 'em up)
Up jump the boogie to the boogie
To bang bang to the boogie, bang bang
(shoot 'em, shoot 'em up)
Up jump the boogie to the boogie
To bang bang to the boogie, bang bang
(shoot 'em, shoot 'em up)
Up jump the boogie to the boog-idy-bee
(Snoop Dogg!)

[Snoop Dogg]
It's the mythological, chronical, diabolicle
Pyschological, make a model hoe fuck a G
Polish ya, demolish ya, turn you all into particles
Shade tree niggaz in the game, I lose 'em like follicles
But that goes in pathetico, vaticles into articles
Read 'bout particles, and I heard that I shot a few
But that's what you gotta do when you're livin' so radical
From me to you my nigga, never yap without your gat fool
Bang bang, we don't play
We fuckin' 'em up er'day, that's why you got carried away
I guess you got carried away, but it's alright, it's okay
Cause we gon' play er'day, I'll cut you like a DJ
*r-r-roa* - cut so fresh
Better yet, I'll put a slug in your chest - yep
And then I'll blind you, bleed you, guide you and mislead you
Tape you, strip you, rape you, then proceed to - 
Put yo' ass up under the dirt (uh hu)
No more pain and no more hurt
I jerk that jerk up out of his skirt
Snoop Dogg stay puttin' in work, motherfucker

[Crystal]
Run up and get dropped
Stop and get popped
Me and my niggaz, we don't stop, won't stop
Run up and get dropped
Stop and get popped
Me and my niggaz, we don't stop, won't stop
Run up and get dropped
Stop and get popped
Me and my niggaz, we don't stop, won't stop
Run up and get dropped
Stop and get popped
Me and my niggaz, we don't stop, won't stop

[Chorus]
You can't tell me shit, get pistol whipped
Fuck what you say, it's the gangsta shit
We the gangsta click, kickin' gangsta shit
Fuck what you say, get pistol whipped</pre>
