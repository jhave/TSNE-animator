[Otis]
Everyday, my clique spray, we don't play
Keep it all time shine, stay the fuck out the way
Haters keep hidin' behind your subliminal raps
Fake when you hate me cause you ain't where I'm at
Be a man, get your own shit, and get in the game
Quit sittin' around waitin' for somethin' to change
And all you starvin' MC's thinkin' I'm to blame
So when your stomach hurts in pain, you scream my name
"AMB said this, AMB did that -
I wrote 'em on the internet, they never wrote back -
Don't they know that I got flow? I spit dope raps -
I rock shows at my house in front of the coat rack!"
Bitch, please
I ain't tryin' to shit on your dreams
So why the fuck you gotta bitch up with your haterous schemes?
You need to stay in the background like a green screen
Say my name so much you should be on my street team, huh?
And I ain't sayin' that I know the way
But we're here to stay and we're never goin' away
To all you horrorcore kids that wanna flow today
Fake shit wouldn't even scare the crows away, motherfucka

[Chorus]
When your stomach hurts in pain - SCREAM MY NAME
When I control your brain - SCREAM MY NAME
Check it out, yo! I keep my Karma at a all time 10
So fuck all of y'all and fuck all of them!

[Bonez Dubb]
B-O-N-E-Z, you know me
And I come from the motherfuckin' 303
And my crew's with me, you wanna know what's up
I'll stab a bitch in the gut and not give a fuck
I see you starin' at my people with a problem on your mind
You can hate me all you want, that's why you're left behind
Maybe that's why you're so damn slow with the flow
Can't take away my home or my bomb hydro
5-0 can pull me over, put my face in the ground
Because I smoke up on pounds and knock a fuckin' pig out
If you really wanna be heard and famous and shit
Quit bein' a bitch and stop suckin' them dicks
No answering machine or analog four-track
Is gonna keep your fuckin' shit from sounding so wack
I attack one of the weak, I'm wrong
Can't even speak on this song
Only the axe that I hold is strong, bitch

[Chorus]
When your stomach hurts in pain - SCREAM MY NAME
When I control your brain - SCREAM MY NAME
Check it out, yo! I keep my Karma at a all time 10
So fuck all of y'all and fuck all of them!

[Bridge: Otis]
What is this? An excuse for a man?
You're runnin' scared, I got an axe in my hand
I'll make it clear so you can all understand -
FUCK ALL OF THEM!

I see your whole squad makin' a plan
You're actin' hard, but you're fakin' it, man
I'll make it clear so you can all understand -
FUCK ALL OF THEM!

We rollin' up in an all black van
We found your crew, but they all just ran
I'll make it clear so you all understand -
FUCK ALL OF THEM!

I told you once, I got an axe in my hand
I'll hit you with it in the face like DAMN
To anybody out there fuckin' with the fam -
FUCK ALL OF THEM!</pre>
