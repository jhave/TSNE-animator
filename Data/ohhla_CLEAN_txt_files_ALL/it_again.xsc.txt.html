Intro: J.D.

Uh, star struck hoes beg me to connect with em
cos I look correct with em and knows how to sex them
Houses on two acre lakes in the Peach State
Eat steak and lobster, steady tryin to prosper
Build up my roster like the ol Motown
Too much to hold down and the whole world know now
I demonstrate stackin' paint platinum tapes
and bustin that ass with groups like XSCAPE
What the deal? Uhh

Verse 1: XSCAPE

I wanna see if you can get down
get down like you say you do
In the midnight when I wanna feel right 
all I think about is you
Put me in a fly position 
Make me wanna scream your name
And just when you think I've had enough
I'm like baby do you think we can do it again?

Chorus:

Cos everytime you show me that
and every which way that you throw my back
I just can't get enough
I find myself sayin "let's do it again, let's do it again"
*repeat*

Verse 2: 

Tingle tingle my body
You make me oohh baby
I ain't been the same since then
that night when you put me in a fly position
You made me scream your name
You can say I'm sprung out, I don't give a damn
I wanna do it again and again and again

Chorus

Bridge:

When we made love for the first time
It felt so good inside
I laid across my bed and watched tears run from my eyes
Too good to let it go
So don't disturb this flow
All I know is I can't wait
can't wait to do it again

Chorus

(In the morning) Cos everytime you show me that
(Sweet love in the summertime) and every which way that you throw my back
(Just your sweet face) I just can't get enough
(all laid up next to mine) I find myself sayin "Let's do it again, let's do
it again"
Cos everytime you show me that (Let's do it again)
and every which way that you throw my back (again, again)
I just can't get enough
I find myself sayin "let's do it again, let's do it again"
Let's do it, do it, do it, do it, do it again
