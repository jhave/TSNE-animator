Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah
Roc N Mayne what up man
What we gone do on this shit right here
I'mma come up with a fly ass hook
I really ain't gone say shit on the verses
Still put these sucka ass niggas in hearses
By the way, I finally sucked my own dick
Leggo!

Snap

[Verse 1]
Live from my grandmama's basement
Camp Crystal Lake, muthafucker I'm Jason
Illuminati membership card, Free Mason
Nah literally free my homeboy Mason
Freebasing, be patient, that's what they telling me
Party for my nigga Ned, he just beat a felony
That be that good shit, my nigga Dizzy mailing me
Lean got a nigga on cruz like Penelope
Need therapy, stressed, don't worry me
Big dick Benton, AKA, Ron Jeremy
When you give me brains, handle my dick carefully
Who the fuck care to be the loser? Bitch marry me!
Suit &amp; Tie shit like Timberlake
I fuck you and then I put your dead body in a lake
Eliminate, disintegrate, sipping on gin and lemonade
Bitch I been a renegade, way before Em and Jay
Whores sick of hearing 'bout Jarren like Kim and Ye
I put a wack rapper on a dinner plate
I penetrate a nigga with ninja blade
I'm 7:30 whipping in a 10 to 8
I'll be there in a minute bitch you finna wait
Lil' Debbie nigga, yeah we getting cake
Drunk driver whipping on the interstate
My girl say her period is really late
I got a home abortion kit, we finna get it straight
Just kidding bitch, good news, that's great!
I hope the president don't ban the fucking AK
My shit wasn't registered anyway
And that's Ice Cube's, fuck niggas like you!

[Chorus]
Some of my niggas sell dope
Some of my niggas, they broke
Some of my niggas smoke weed
Some of my niggas snort coke
Some of my niggas, they made it
Some of my niggas they won't
Regardless y'all my niggas, we gone roll
Just like Cadillacs and Chevys

Cadillacs &amp; Chevys (Yeah!) [x7]

Snap

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they say I sound like Eminem
Mixed with 3K, y'all ain't offending him
Your hoes swing from my balls like a pendulum
If you don't like 'em my nigga get rid of them!
Gon' get to killing them
I'll help ya hide the bodies, I ain't feeling them
I'm high like helium
I'm trying to gross one billion, my kicks reptilian
I'm tryna fuck Christina Milli-an!
Or Millian, phenomenon, I ain't tripping I'll even fuck Chaka Khan
With nothing but a stocking on, y'all niggas ain't eating like Ramadan
You ain't bussin' not even with a hundred guns
Fuck a fat bitch for a honey bun
I'll fuck a nerd down at Comic-Con
Never know the kind of shit that I be on
You be hanging with the maricon (faggot)
I be strangling the microphone, I used to play the xylophone
Macaulay Culkin bitch yeah I ride alone
Yeah bitch I'm in the zone, yeah bitch I'm blowing strong
I'm tryna get it like I'm Puffy Combs
I'm tryna fuck and then she going home
Top gun, welcome to the danger zone
I'll stomp a niggas teeth out with Wranglers on
Pussy ass nigga, gon' get your hating on
And if you know the fuckin' words bitch then sing-a-long!

[Chorus]</pre>
