Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I stay sharp yeah mack diamond so sharp thats me
I mean you kno my money grown but I stay sharp
I pull up lookin like new money still so crisp so fly
hoppin outta the latest whatever you know what it is let's go

[Chorus]
I got the hottest cars I rock the flyest clothes
I keep the baddest hoes they fresh from head to toe
sharp yeen kno sharp hell ya sharp yeen kno sharp hell ya
I got the hottest cars I rock the flyest clothes
I keep the baddest hoes they fresh from head to toe sharp
yeen kno sharp hell ya sharp yeen kno sharp hell ya

Now check my pedigree my bloodline is purebred
my champagne is rose cuz the color is more red
my pockets like skin when I whip they swell up (money)
those 26 inches fill the wheel well up (fresh)
you can catch me in the winter with a mink on my shoulders
I like everything big so my diamonds like boulders
and yea I had every kinda roadster or rover
cuz I love the fast lane like a supercharged motor
and I'm so damn hood like gold daytons on a regal
but in '09 I gotta dime on the back of a screamin eagle
big chicken hard make it hard spin it in the pot
and now its millions every year whether albums drop or not

[Chorus] - 2X

I pass up in it and be like what it do
all red to my feet but my diamonds clear blue
nuttin like the police in a porsche 911
stuntin up that stairway to heaven
and I'm evidently not you and nuttin like ya
if I as a dog I wouldn't bite ya
nor I'm not beside ya boy I'm way in front of ya
you ain't even see me ya
I'm way gone but you ain't even leavin
drugs beatin me up I'm fightin for my life
and if you want that pussy beat then I'm mike tyson for tonight
suck me up and don't you bite I don't need mike tyson here tonight
my blood type is like a knife motha fucka I'm sharp

[Chorus]</pre>
