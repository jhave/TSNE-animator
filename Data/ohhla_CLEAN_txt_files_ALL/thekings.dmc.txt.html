I gotta come to your rings, cause I'm so high
That even you and R. Kelly believe I can fly
Selling jammies when them Grammy rappers chanting and cheering
Selling more than all of y'all without a record in years
My catalog got a long list of hits in the stores
And for you sample-happy suckers out there breaking the laws
Rather hit you where it gets you, bring you up on a charge
You'd be better just to let a lawyer know from the start

The King of Rock, who?
That be my hobby and job
And when I come and bring the ruckus 
suckers duck and then dodge
The King of Rock, what?
That be my hobby and job
And when I come and bring the ruckus 
suckers duck and then dodge
The King of Rock, who?
That be my hobby and job
And when I come and bring the ruckus 
suckers duck and then dodge
The King of Rock, what?
That be my hobby and job
And when I come and bring the ruckus 
suckers duck and then dodge

[DJ Rev. Run]
Well rock a rhyme for me, then a rhyme for you
And everybody catch the Boogaloo Blues

D-Generation X, and you know what's next

[DJ Rev. Run]
The vibration flexed up upon your set
This is my steez, MCs, and these are my days
I bring my homeys, suckers know me from back in the day
It's DJ Run, y'all, and this is how I get down
D-Generation X, coming to your town

An apple to a peach, and a cherry to a plumb
We won't stop rocking till you all get some
The seed to the apple and the apple to the core
We are the two with the rhymes galore
The ball to the bounce, the bounce to the ball
This is the crew, we're gonna rock you all
D-Generation X coming to your town
And if you get in our way, we gonna chop you down
