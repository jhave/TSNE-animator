Spy Detail: There was a 498-DS
A top-secret formula had been stolen from the research lab
We had a job to do
We ran all suspects name through R&amp;I and came up with 

(King Kirk)
Respond like James Bond to this con named Don
milli-ons in his palms, sellin' neutron bombs
Time 6 a.m., agent mayhem and eight men, no maybe ten 
came to scoop me in the Benz in the ??Graham??
Money involved? Say when, gave me a beige Range and thangs 
but they claimed the Range changed to a plane, strange
but perfect, showed me circuits and how to work it
Wounds- how to nurse it, weapons- how to burst it
searched it, like a serpent, read the blueprints
dime be with two chinks sportin' links and new minks
Drive a six with dark tints and one of the chinks 
named Dinks and Dinks always drinks so he thinks he's invinc'
Other chinks a wimp, but Teflon's his vest holds
if he think you gonna roll, he'll put holes in your dress code/
Time to load and hit the highway, I'ma do it my way
Spy way, do or die way, Schwarzenegger, True Lie way!
So I pulled up on the drive way, ran thru the side way
saw his compadres, motherfucker, yippee kay-ah
Die hard!, nigga yelled "my God!", caught an Uzi scar,
hit the tar, other bullet to the car, "Ah!"
Time to pay him back, time to fade him
Got up tried to spray him, no aim, so I grenade him/
didn't get the Don but the bombs was a factor
Found what I was after, set the reactors
for two minutes, heard laughter and "lieutenant you finished"
It was the Don with a Smitheth, Wessun to my chestun
for a second I thought I was dead, no more said 
then I heard shots of lead and lead sped through his forehead
Brando with the ammo and Dubez with the Uz'
Move into plane rovers, motherfucker, we spy hunters

(Big Dubez)
Big Dubez, Billy D, four-five, concealed weapon
Runnin thru bricks that niggaz ain't yet step on
Eludin Cop-po, in the eight, inhalin char-coal
They tailin but I'm Indy 500 Monaco
Pigs can't stop no, Sporty Thiev Gestapo,
They sickened against flip whips to saw you slick and
out the fender, yo, no retreat no surrender
To the fullest, that's why my toys deflect bullets!
On the cell like "Who in charge?  Get me the sarge" 
Your squad car next, your fam reached my garage
Espio-nage, yo my fate on the rocks
I blow 'em out the box, firin missiles on roadblocks
On the verge on smack-ups, forces callin for back-up
chunked in the trunk, 200 ki's to crack up
Breathe holdin's essential, spy-hunter utensils
four govermentals with four sets of dentals
I'm on a Cannonball Run like Burt Reynolds
Bustin off at the choppers, backin down coppers

(Gunshots)---ooooh!!

(Marlon Brando)
We in the Phillipines, on death row, about to face guillotines
my crew lace marines, stick over and make realer teams
so yo, say hello to my li'l friend, wanna play? 
OK! feel ten thru your steel, man
Yo we come together like foreign lea-ders
Livin large in Argen-tina, camouflaged in Kor-ea, 
in the bushes where they can't see-us
spin astro 16 silence-face screw ons
Mission impossible, merge em to the Persians
with 2 glocks to my head, enuff cream to flip the script
Got niggaz watchin the Feds, twenty ultra-red
beams comin through my window, tear-gas bleak up my glass, 
The smoke blew the crib-bo, the coke moves are ditto
Layin blue in Beirut, sneak-in weed-in Swe-den
Shook the D's in Peru, like a crooked Batman 
with no partner but still (robbing/Robin),
trails be mind-bogglin, leave the D's followin
my front man, I be the big man behind the front man
Front man got knocked? Big man still be the trump man
Mix six crews and their glues, skully low smokin ni-ckles
Runnin' up in cold blocks with ic-icles, spray the trey-nickle
guaranteed to hit you, if I miss you
bullets will probably ricochet and nip you
and fall like the Berlin wall
hang 'em off ??the terror spies?? lets make a ball
crooked navy seals with flak-on, sniffin, getting they crack on
I managed to mack on enough oil to put Iraq on, stapped the gats on
for this spy-war, coke lab, helicopter roof, and a cy-borg</pre>
