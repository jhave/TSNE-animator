One Two One Two
Ugh, yeah
You got the levels strait? 
(Yeah)
Let's do my thing
Aiite

Talkin shit while he was rollin his weed
My nigga hit him in the face
(Broken blunt, broken front)
Didn't know disrespect would lead to such a serious case
(Broken la, broken jaw)
If you knew how to read the situation you would stay in your place
(Broken bone socket, broken pocket)
If there's one thing everyone needs is they goddamn space

Lemme talk bout it as I rock it
Gimme five feet all round the world
I don't want nobody touching me unless it's my girls
I give a pound a hugs, some love but that's that
Don't be tappin me on the shoulders
Or patting me on the back
Or pulling my arm or checking my size
I'm libel to do harm 
My temple is my prize
I'm wise and on the really
I ain't too touchy feely
If you put your hands up on me I might smack you silly
It's a billion people touch somebody else touch yourself
I'll be trying to get at you if I'm needin your help
But until then, maybe when I'm dead and stiff
But to touch you without touching you is one of my gifts

Talkin shit while she was drunk at the bar
My homie slapped her in the face
(Dirty mouth, dirty dress)
She didn't know that disrespect would lead to such a serious case
(Broken heel, broken nail)
If she knew how to read the situation she would stay in her place
(Broken chain, broken locket)
If there's one thing everyone needs is they goddamn space
Lemme talk bout it as I rock it
Why you all up up under me screaming in my ear?
Why you tryin to talk over the music when you know we barely care?
Why you tuggin on my coattail, grabbin on my sleeve?
Yo cover your mouth when you cough around me
Don't touch me when you sneeze
I don't like disease
And I don't wanna give you what I got
Yeah, I hit the weed but what I don't need is somebody always at my spot 
Standing where I'm standing
Breathing down my neck
Yo have some respect
I guess you think that water ain't wet
Just backthefuckup
No I ain't stuck up
I just don't want to hear your moans and groans and hiccups sistah
The reporter with the tape recorder is all up in my grill
But to touch you without touching you is one of my skills

Talkin shit while he was up on the mic 
Somebody hit him in the face
(Broken nose, broken flows)
He didn't know that disrespect would lead to such a serious case
(Dirty rap, dirty scratch)
If he knew how to read the situation he would stay in his place
(Broken eye socket trying to block it)
If there's one thing everyone needs is they goddamn space

Lemme talk bout it as I rock it
Now Imma draw the lines in the ground and show you my squares
At least arm's distance, so stand over there
Hey love you know I miss you, and how we embrace
But I'll let you know if I wanna kiss you or see how you taste
Yo we all got issues we need to face
So don't think I'm trying to dis you when I tell you the case
In case you're wondering it's just like that it
I like this telepathy
I already know whatchu gonna say before you step to me
I hate crowded elevators and downtown rush
Packed trains, crazy ass people on the bus
Sometimes I roll plush looking so Cold Crush
But I'd rather teleport through space so ya'll could bite my dust
Use body language, baby, I can dig that
But homie you need to kick back and relax on the act
The bottom line is don't invade nobody's zone or maybe yo's
Sincerely Aceyalone 
Talkin shit while he was walkin the streets 
Somebody shot him in the face
(Hurtin brother, hurtin mother)
He didn't know that disrespect would lead to such a serious case
(Wicked ways, wicked days)
If you knew how to read the situation you would stay in your place
(Cuz you don't understand it, don't knock it)
If there's one thing everyone needs is they goddamn space

Lemme talk bout it as I rock it
Gimme five feet 
All around the world, yeah!
Ugh, gimme a zone
My space, my square
And to each his own
To each man and woman and child
Yeah, alright
