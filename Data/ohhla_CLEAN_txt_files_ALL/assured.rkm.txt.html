	Double oh seven is back..

[Rakim]
I don't stress my day cause it's best to parlay
I guess you could say I've been away
I wake up slow when I'm hot but I destruct the plant
and fourteen hands comb New York for fans
They make waves as they wiggle in my waterbed
Pull back the leather covers and silk bedspread
A mornin massage turnin into a real rough rubdown
so I figured I'll lay around
They keep me wet with a juice called Tahiti
It make the room steamy, so soon they couldn't see me
They know more than calisthetics as they worked up a sweat
It wasn't even ten o'clock yet
Scrub down, then I get moist, they never treat me mean
They sweetly keep me squeaky clean
I chill as they filled the jacuzzi
I said, "I'm tight from a real long flight, could you soothe me
Support my thoughts, cause I got a lot of writing to do"
They said, "Cool," and just enjoyed the view
It ain't hard cause it's miles from the sidewalk
I'm overlookin every borough in New York
The entire, Empire, State to concentrate
for every rhyme I make
So at exactly noon they played my favorite tune
And just before they all cleared the room
they said, "We're glad you're home from tour, now we feel secure
We wish you didn't have to leave no more"
But they wanna go to war, they even tried to shoot up the door
	Double oh seven is back..
Rest assured

	Double oh seven is back..
Feel secure
	Double oh seven is back..

I'm fillin up the page when I'm steppin on stage
Got the people in a rage with they hands in the air
Fellas sayin HOE, everybody yellin GO
Fly ladies in the house all screamin "awww yeah"
That's how they react when I attack the mic
In fact it's like a stack of dynamite, powerful and bright
Girls love to squeeze me real tight
Double oh seven is back..
Ra has returned, to romance em, better than Johnny Handsome
When I was young, women said, "Damn son"
Ain't nuthin change but the year and I'm still here
C'mere dear and let me whisper in your ear
Hug my words so I can taste your lips
I set up hips like domino chips
but I don't let em hit the floor
And if you got sore, then feel secure
Where's the pain, is it the spot you set us in
Almost magic, better than medicine
Take one of these and put your mind at ease
I get more work than a lot of M.D.'s
If I'm hawkin New York, or out on tour
I express the raw dialect and explore
But don't get fooled by metaphor
		Double oh seven is back
Rest assured

Feel secure
Rest assured
Rest assured
Yo, feel secure</pre>
