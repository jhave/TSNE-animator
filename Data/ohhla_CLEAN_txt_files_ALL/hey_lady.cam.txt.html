[Verse 1]
I know you heard me in british rob
But I get you bracelets till ya wrist is throbbed
Just kissed the nob, and put your meat on my stick like a shish-ka-bob
Out mingalin', heard that I blingy-bling
But I run the circus like ring-a-ling
I'm the king of things, and your man he a homo like jing-a-ling
(jing-a-ling)
That's life, hit 'em with the pow-ping
Pow, pow, .45 load thing
Look wild thing, I do wild things, make China stretch like Yoa Ming
Ching chong like a higher Chow Main
I buy lango ma, I don't need a nickel, naw
Oh you tickled ma? 'cause your nipples huh
Commin' through your shirt, nearly ripped your bra

[Chorus]
I see the hate in your eyes, damn them boys is too fly
The way we roll up, rims all swoll up, ice all froze up
And while you're actin' surprised, like we dough sellin' pies
They way we hold up, papi hole up, mami roll up

[Verse 2]
I know a school in work, but you need to schooled in work
Put my 2 to work, I feelin' your shoes, your purse
You get low on dough, the few the first
I don't need you high like I'm high
But shit, I need you fly like I'm fly
Fresh, Lui Vuitton ankle
Pastel, Lui Vuitton rainbow
Threw on the Kango, threw on Durango's
Not from the 'nati, but through on the Bengals
Moved on an angle, like a baler malodor
The two gon' tango
Shake your body mami, move your body hottie
Its true on kamikaze, I'm movin' a mazarattie
They all polly polly, voo boy dolly dolly
I don't talk like the swolly mami

[Chorus]
I see the hate in your eyes, damn them boys is too fly
The way we roll up, rims all swoll up, ice all froze up
And while you're actin' surprised, like we dough sellin' pies
They way we hold up, papi hole up, mami roll up

[Verse 3]
Lady, dry your panties
Damn, she wanna right her family
Tell em Nad, I'm a dyper dandy
And I got all type of candy
Whats that? Victoria Secret
Here's Lapearla, come peep it
This lingerie that you could honor A
Wonder woman, ouuiii, go on play
Like Cam' watch, like Cam' ring
Like Cam' chain, like Cam' bling
Heard Cam' sing, if a damn fling
Goddamn mam', not a damn thing

[Chorus]
I see the hate in your eyes, damn them boys is too fly
The way we roll up, rims all swoll up, ice all froze up
And while you're actin' surprised, like we dough sellin' pies
They way we hold up, papi hole up, mami roll up</pre>
