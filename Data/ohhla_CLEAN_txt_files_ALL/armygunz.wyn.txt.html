[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah (I got army gunz)
Yeah yeah yeah (I-I-I got army gunz)
Yeah yeah yeah (I-I-I-I got army gunz)
Yeah yeah yeah (I-I-I-I-I got army gunz)
Now ya know I play it like a pro in the game
Now ya know I play it like a pro in the game
Now ya know I play it like a pro in the game
Now ya know I play it like a pro in the game

[Lil Wayne]
Okay I'm out 'chea you niggaz done started it ya ordered it
Bullet find a home in ya arteries pardon me
But them niggaz won't touch not a part of me bet on it
Them niggaz belong in a sorority ain't that a bitch
Burn they bodies up for the authorities no evidence
You gon' stop fuckin' wit' them warriors from New Orleans
And I really think that it'd be better if
I just hit ya block wit that baretta and hop out and let her rip
Let her bang let her bust etcetera etcetera
You niggaz is scared of the southern part of America
Here it come got her done never caught without one
Niggaz wanna ball so I guess I gotta bounce 'em
Smokin' on a ounce of that shit from the mountains
People say I need to stop no I need a counselor
And I'm here you are gonna need a chopper
And I'ma need a lawyer and you gon' need a doctor
Why? Because...

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Get at 'em we hit 'em up if they rattin'
Niggaz ain't fuckin' wit' the boy them niggaz softer than satin
I'm feelin' awfully aggy yes I walk wit' the maggy
I tell him park in a alley and leave 'em parked in the alley
Niggaz talkin' about me but they ain't talkin' it at me
'Cause if they talkin' it at me then I'm just talkin' to caskets
All that talkin' is pussy bitch you better make ya words strong
'Cause the shit gettin' chiseled on ya tombstone
What they do I got a chopper in the UHaul
Make a real nigga bring it back to '92 dog
Bring his ass to the river drop the fool off
Hope he can swim wit' them concrete shoes on
I got the gun right beside me who don't?
Got beef homie I was just gettin' hungry
When you come bitch you better bring a army
We can do it in the streets and throw a gansgta party nigga
Why? Because...

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Thirty shots in the clip niggaz let's trip
Line 'em up put 'em down on the guest list
These niggaz 'bout to make me go Rambo
I'ma take the shit as far as it can go
War is the answer if ya questionin' the general
Snap shots at'cha baby you are just a centerfold
And less Kenneth Cole niggaz seem plenty bold
Pull that bitch out alright don't make me get my fishin' pole
Them niggaz hoes really doe
I would swing down there wit' any O Forty-Fo' and let 'em go
Let 'em know that I ain't never been sweet and won't be
Yes I'll be right here on the ground when you want me
Make a nigga have to come back like wit' the smack
Thomas bitch I promise I'll kill ya and that's a fact
And I ain't never killed no one jack
But I'm honest bitch I promise I'll kill ya and that's a fact
Why? Because...
