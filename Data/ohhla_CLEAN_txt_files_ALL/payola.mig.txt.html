Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Quavo]
Migos
You might call it Monifa
But I call it Payola
I'm getting that guacamole
Migo!

[Chorus]
Yola, Payola, Payola, Payola
All I ever need in my life, Payola
Yola, Payola, Payola
Yola, Payola, Payola
Yola, Payola, Payola
All I ever need in my life, Payola
Yola, Payola, Payola
Yola, Payola, Payola

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Trapping off of Motorolas
The plug, he in Minnesota
I got the flavors, Willy Wonka
Gotta make sure that your ticket is golden
I told my momma don't worry
We gon' take off any moment
Remember me kickin in doors and giving you jewelry from where it was stolen?
Now it's Maserati splashin' sideways
Never been scared to get paid
Throwing money on the highway
Now that Carlito the Migos' Way
Dinosaur, alligator, komodo dragon or Giuseppe toes
Andale came with my Payola
Don't make me jump off the tall blow

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
All I need is a stove and a bando
30 minutes, make a milli, Alejandro
I be playing with them bowls but no banjo
We don't sugar coat
AK split your cantaloupe
Adam Sandler, I control my hoes with no remote
Quality Control in every magazine article
You thinking 'bout robbing me
Better off shooting yourself, Plaxico
No scientist, for you snakes, I got the antidope

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Offset]
Broccoli, Broccoli
Young Offset on top of you niggas like I'm an apostrophe
No Monopoly
I'm sticking these niggas don't make me take your momma property
You niggas is pussy acting like a diva
Got the 40 on my hip like a [?]
You don't want no problems with the Grim Reaper
When it come to money niggas get evil
I'm not gon' let up like I'm DG Yola
Double seals from Minnesota
Guiseppes and now they walking on komodos
No vending machine but I'm selling that coca
Yola, Payola, Payola
The feds they ran in my trap
But they didn't find the bricks cause they was in the sofa

[Chorus]</pre>
