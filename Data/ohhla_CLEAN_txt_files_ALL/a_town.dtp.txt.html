[Chorus x2 - Chimere + Lil' Fate]
A-Town hats, and A-Town jerseys
Watch them A-Town boys, they play the game dirty
Matter fact floss in the A-Town witcha jewelry
Will getcha laid down in the A-Town, shorty you heard me

[Verse 1 - Lil' Fate]
You can find me in a Polo shirt, Polo pants, Polo boots
Looking cute, in my Polo suit
That was back then in '95 [Yeah]
In West Lake, pep rally, reping Banker High [Yeah]
Them boys ain't like it, but they had to play it cool shorty
I'm wit them hersey roll boys, they was acting fool shorty
You know, Cam, Chip, Zae, bought these seagulls wit me
Quincy, Langston, Ron, and Shondre was wit me
Please believe College Park, back jumping mayne
Sunday nights, Frozen Paradise, off the chain
Youngstas flossing old school, wit the candy paint
Sitting on chrome feet, old enough to drank
Look homes, this my state, my city, my home boy
So I'ma rep the Park hard, for my homeboys
Gotty Road, Riverdale, Hillendale, boys
That jump out the day shorty, get to take yours

[Chorus x2 - Chimere + Lil' Fate]
A-Town hats, and A-Town jerseys
Watch them A-Town boys, they play the game dirty
Matter fact floss in the A-Town witcha jewelry
Will getcha laid down in the A-Town, shorty you heard me

[Verse 2 - Tity Boi]
Uh, uh, me and the A-Town model niggas, stick to the script
You see me riding on flash, when I'm parking the whip
Before I enter the club, and endangered species
Looking sharper than a mugg, and them heavy creases
Bitch jumped out, 'Lac wit the bump
And before they could say, that it was very crunk
Get gon' and get the gat on, out of the trunk
And I walked around wit the hat on, like I was drunk
Yeah, and I play on left field
Like, I swing so much iron, they call me Gary Sheffield
And I'ma brave as player, and I'm dead real
I got them O's for them low, what you got ain't deal
Like taking pennies out ya stow, you can take the "Boi" off the "Tity"
But can't take the "Tity" off the "Boi"
And I got so many A's, that people thought I was cheating
Nah, got so many Z's, that people thought I was sleeping, and them

[Chorus x2 - Chimere + Lil' Fate]
A-Town hats, and A-Town jerseys
Watch them A-Town boys, they play the game dirty
Matter fact floss in the A-Town witcha jewelry
Will getcha laid down in the A-Town, shorty you heard me

[Verse 3 - Infamous 2-0]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, It go Eastside, flat South, Glenwood, here we go
They call me D-Lo, Mr. Bronx, and bitch I 2-0
I'm down in Jazzy T's, I spend 1000 g's
I like them hoes that dance for me, then they leave wit me
Ooh so strong, hoes love the country accent
Hit it a hour and a half, then she won't me back and
Bitch squeeze, if it's beef, I'm bucking feels
A.K.A., R. Kelly, 'cause I'm fucking with kids
You know [???], slouch socks, Air Ones and braids
Throwbacks, Akademiks, and a wave cap
Old school Caddy, riding on grown men
That's how we live, you don't never leave the crib before ten
Uh, there's just something bout us, our system beat the loudest
Now we deep in the game, you can never out us
Think you know a nigga greater, then bet, put money on it
Please believe it in Decatur, if it ain't got 20's on it

[Chorus x2 - Chimere + Lil' Fate]
A-Town hats, and A-Town jerseys
Watch them A-Town boys, they play the game dirty
Matter fact floss in the A-Town witcha jewelry
Will getcha laid down in the A-Town, shorty you heard me

[Outro - Lil' Fate]
Shorty ya heard me, shorty ya heard me
Watch them boys in them A-Town hats, they play the game dirty
Shorty ya heard me, shorty ya heard me
Don't floss in the A-Town, you get laid down surely
