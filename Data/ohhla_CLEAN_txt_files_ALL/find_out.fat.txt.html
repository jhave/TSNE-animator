Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Armageddon]
Yeah yeah
Do you Don Cartagena
solemnly swear to take this game of hip-hop
as your lawfully wedded wife
through sickness and health, til death do you part?

[Fat Joe]
I do

[Armageddon]
Aight then
You now may spit on the bride

[Fat Joe]
I bet you thought I left you hangin, Joe Crack returns bangin
with somethin brand spankin, what the fuck was y'all thinkin?
Blow out your tweeters, have dinner with world leaders
Terror Squad so much they be cats with dark caesars
Fast cars and millimeters, gold cards and Visa's
Givin nonbelievers ways to fly with Jesus
Here's my thesis, enterprise break the block to pieces
Hustler and hard pool shark like Jack Gleason
The only reason I came back was for the platinum
With raps, ten times more deadly than saccharin
MC's be actin, I think somebody needs to slap em
Run up on em attack em, and ask em what's his passion
My love is rockin shows at the highest extremity
This star from Trinity got your mom sayin she's feelin me
Who's dealin ki's, that's peace, get your cheese, ?
Pump this masterpiece at the loudest degree

Chorus: Fat Joe, Armageddon (repeat 2X)

Let me find out (find out) niggaz is noddin out
Take some time out (time out) you wondered my whereabouts
The truth is I never left you, I kept my promise (what?)
Don Cartagena blessed you, now pay homage

[Fat Joe]
Yo fuck movin mountains, I move planets and you be Earthless
Terror Squad the worst that hurt shit, split you to verses
Joey Crack the world in half, Punisher punish em
til they lose the hopes and dreams they had
Then Armageddon finish em
Yo I'm bout as braze as Satan, no exaggeratin
My crew is radiatin, shinin while you playa-hation
Cartagena hit em like the Red Army invasion
Operatiion lace em show em what they facin, what?
I've been down since the days of Flash
when it was fun and laughs, before hip-hop was based on cash
Let's blaze a sack and concentrate on coke inflation
You know the biggest asses in United Nations
Fuck the Federation, general population is hibernatin
But bear witness to information that'll rock this nation
I'm not God, but indeed, my mind's relatin
Better act now, before your life is wasted
cause time is racin

Chorus 2X

[Armageddon]
Yeah, now do you hip-hop
take Don Cartagena, as your lawfully wedded husband
Now by the power invested in me, by me
I pronounce you husband and wife

[Fat Joe]
Joey Crack, a.k.a. Kaiser Soze
Heads beware, there's mad fear in the air
Joey Crack, a.k.a. Kaiser Soze
Knuckleheads beware, knuckleheads beware
Joey Crack, a.k.a. Kaiser Soze
Knuckleheads beware, there's mad tension in the air</pre>
