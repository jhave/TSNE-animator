Ha ha
They ain't gon' understand this, Flavor Flav
PAYBACK~! R.G., yo we gon' slam 'em with this one here

Kill that mumbo jumbo, time to rumble in the jungle
Shootin shotguns at the leopards, even lions is the shepherds
Now I ain't got time to tell her, but I'm chillin with Magilla
And I don't mean at the pet shop, but up in Harlem at the wet shop
Eatin on this side of wetson's, spendin all my loot, with the Jetsons
Even the robot drank some oils, so she can lubricate her coils
Tarzan did his best, to bust a nut and beat his chest
He was lookin me up, so I hunted him down
Then I told everybody in the town I said

[Chorus]
Unga bunga bunga G! (Unga bunga bunga G!)
Say unga bunga bingo bonga! (Unga bunga bingo bonga!)
Say unga bunga bunga G! (Unga bunga bunga G!)
Say unga bunga bingo bonga! (Unga bunga bingo bonga!)

[Flavor Flav]
Think you said rabbit had to have it, broke all his fingers at the lab an'
No hand to shoot his gun-a, so he couldn't catch my runner
So he called out to Speed Racer, but he had no gas to chase her
Then they started doin flips, to Gladys Knight and the Pips
Ring ding dong, ring-a-ding-ding-ding-doooooooong
Ring ding dong, ring-a-ding-ding-ding-doooooooong
Flaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaav, stop this crazy thing!
Flaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaav, drop this song you sing! Say

[Chorus] minus last line

[Flavor Flav]
SAY UNGA, BUNGA, BINGO, BONGA, BINGA, BANGA, BUNGA!!
  {*instrumental only until 2:50*}
Say

[Chorus]

[Flavor Flav]
SAY UNGA, BUNGA, BINGO, BONGA, BINGA, BANGA, BUNGA!!
(UNGA, BUNGA, BINGO, BONGA, BINGA, BANGA, BUNGA!!)
Say unga bunga bunga G! (Unga bunga bunga G!)
SAY UNGA, BUNGA, BINGO, BONGA, BINGA, BANGA, BUNGA!!
(UNGA, BUNGA, BINGO, BONGA, BINGA, BANGA, BUNGA!!)

[Chorus] - 1/2</pre>
