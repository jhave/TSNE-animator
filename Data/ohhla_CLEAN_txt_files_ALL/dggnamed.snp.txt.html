[Snoop Dogg]
10-20-71, the day I come out
Two days later, I'm runnin' my mouth
Mom's put a bottle to my grill
I look her in the face and I say chill
So she puts her back up on a pillow, uh huh
Two minutes later I'm bailin' out the hos-pital
On my way to the liquor store
First thing I grab is some skins and a 4-0
Dropped the O-E cause it's just too cold
Get myself some gin instead and then I stroll
But before I get out the door
The man behind the counter says hey, yo, yo
He picks me up and sit me on the seat
And then he get the phone and get to dialin' the police
I'm on the run but I can't walk yet
Can't grapple nothin' said, cause I can't talk yet
First trip in the police car
Cameras all around me as if I was a star
Mom's grabbed me, hugged me, and kissed me
This fool tried to twist me, mom's say she missed me (I missed you)
Re-group it, swoopin' in the coupe and
That's what I'ma name you cause boy you be snoopin'
Soon to be hoopin' hoes I be scoopin'
First piece of ass before I got my first whoopin'
Cookin', bookin', hookin' up with G's
Twenty days later I'm from R-T-C
Doin' it up, rollin', givin' it up
Sellin' candy for a white boy outta light blue truck
And I'm comin' up, that's right, niggas runnin' up
Havin' fun and stuff
You niggas don't want none of us

[Snoop talking]
What's up homie (What's up cuz, where you from)
My name Snoop Dogg (Where you from though)
Eastside, rollin' twenty crip (What)
(Oh) yeah (OK, it's all good cuz) That's what I'm talkin' bout
(Yeah) Ah, you gonna feel me nigga, sooner or later

[Hook]
Motherfucking dogg (Named Snoop) that's right (SNOOP!)
(Named Snoop) bow wow (SNOOP!) bow wow
Motherfucking dogg (Named Snoop), Motherfucking dogg (Named Snoop)
Yeah (SNOOP!) what's up (SNOOP!) what's happenin' bow wow
Motherfucking dogg (Named Snoop) roll, roll with me

[Snoop Dogg]
Roll with me, S-N-double O-P
Mel-man where ya been O.G.
Tell me, the game'll never fail me
Ask J or my lil' homie Shelby
Uh, I cut em' up like Marcus Welby
This is the dopest G, that chu' will ever see
There'll never be, another me
By the grace of God, ya lovin' me
Pause, do it to em' dogg
Now drop a rock em' dogg
Now put a lock em' dogg
Rollin' down the river spinnin' on a log
Jog to the liquor store, grab me a thicker ho
Get me a Michelob, now I wanna Snicker though
Remind me of the old days
When my mama used to bang the O'Jays
Family reunion, ha ha, hey 8-track style
Mel-Man you a fool for this cuz
Cause I'm the motherfucking dogg, named Snoop</pre>
