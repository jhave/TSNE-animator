Yeah nigga
We gonna smoke this motherfucker right here, right
We gonna smoke this shit
And I'ma drink a lot a water 
And I'ma take Golden Seal, so my PO don't find out
I'm smoking this shit, aight?

Yo, niggas wouldn't rob Frankie if they had the chance
Wasn't cause of him it was cause of his man Lance
Frankie cut crack
Lance hold the Mac
If fiends fuck with Frankie's pac's
Lance cut the crack heads blocked up
Thought he was locked up
Came thru stuntin' wit his wrist all rocked up
Shoulda seen him smile, missin' the tooth
Coupe missin the roof
He like "What up, 50?"
I'm like "What up with you"
Lance had a reputation that was well earned
Heard he taught niggas how them shells burn
Out there in Red Firm
At the dice game, he rolled ahead, crapped in the crack
I'm like "Nah, I ain't paying for that!  Nigga, shoot it back"
Niggas lookin at me like I'm crazy, they shook
I don't give a fuck who he shot out in Red Hook
Asked him about ????
Yeah, Bizzy was my man till he beat me for ten grand and sold my Mac for
seven grand (Fuckin' crazy)
The man was crazy I could tell by his look
Cause he looked the way I look
When I look for a jooks
Bitch

Motherfucker
Teamwork, work hard nigga
50 cent
Rotten Apple
G-UNIT
Lloyd Banks
Tony Yayo, nigga

Hey what up, nigga 
You motherfuckin' right this DJ Clue Grand Theft Audio 2
Get the fuck out the car nigga don't make me rush you, nigga
Shoot that nigga, 50!</pre>
