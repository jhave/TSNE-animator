[P. Diddy]
1, 2, 1, 2 
yeh y'all can hear me
make the drumming sound yeh
lets ride yeh yeh
be clear we here lights out
eat here  sleep here my house
rhyme wasting time wasting
feds want me caged in
hope they got patience
more you win they want you to lose
I don't floss no more I drop jewels
Hope we might chill the heights real
Still we got fire that will melt your ice grill
Know the deal once we hit record
Hit the floor
New era this is war
Lord I'm the answer without a question
No evidence no possession
Stop stressing
Shit I got moves to make
Streets is dark but still I illuminate nigga
I could see the way
Till I see the end to me and BIG meet again yeh

[Mark Curry]
Curry going hit again
Dreams your living in
This what you coulda been
Every city foot scene gets scrilla with em
kid shortchange the dealer
the game be gorilla
ain't nothing illa
aka 800 toll free aside
I rose to be a Bad Boy til' I die
The official bonafide (fide)
Tested and tried (tried)
Get in like Canson
Work from the inside
When I ride eyes are wide
Ain't that I lick when I walk
My some pimping to my stride
Some wit a emphis on my side
Cause I understand niggas out to get I
Living the life
Is no lie
Been a great thing to do
Nuttin I could think change the view
Althought it might seem strange to you
Its plain to me
I'm here with you
Lets give them what they came to see

[Big Azz Ko]
Yow yow aiiyo
We exceptional
Congressional
Its best that you bester crew
Wit your flesh going bruise
Blood goin ooze and
However you choose your ass goin lose
This ain't the blues
 Don't things that cruise
Go bring the news
Wit flows meaning cruel
From few options
To cruise hopping
Now fools plotting cause I chart topping
From bounce checks to being in effect (fect)
And it don't stop till they reinterbect
Rhyme calisthetics
Bad Boy anesthetics
Will twist me like crippie
Amanda Chevitts
Back flips tactics
Be on measure
Hat tricks wit only dimes and better
Nigga just for that cheddar
O please I switch cheese to leather

[Loon]
Uh yeh uh yeh uh
Check it out yo
Y'all niggas say what y'all wanna say
Feel how y'all wanna feel
Who give a fuck dog kill who you wanna kill
Just keep it real when it come to me
Cuz all my niggas in the slums kinda hungary
On my right where my gun going be
Bitches ain't getting a crumb from me
Member when niggas used to run from me
All of a sudden niggas names is buzzing
Nigga in the game got a little chain becuz
Heard the nigga signed a major budget
But I'm the nigga made you love
Now you wanna change the subject
I ain't sweating that animosity
I'm deading that
Instead of rap imma smack you dead in your trap
I don't give a fuck what I said on a track
Niggas know me better than that
Niggas I could neva be wack
My money way to ahead of you cats
I'm going strait to the top where the cheddar be at
Wassup wit that
Yeh bad boy nigga
Fuck y'all wanna do

[P. Diddy]
As y'all can see when have come to the end of our program
Very important that I let y'all know
That I truly appreciate and I'm thankful
For all your support
For everybody that's been down from day one
I love you
We love you
P. Diddy and the Bad Boy Family
We out
Aiiyo BIG we miss you
