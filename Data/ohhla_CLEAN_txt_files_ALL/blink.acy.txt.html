[uncredited spoken word poet forms the song's intro]
With a grin that matched his own she said,
"You're not a thief, are you?"
He shrugged.  "Do I look like a thief?"
"You look like the most attractive man here."
She paused long enough to catch his eye;
of course looks can be deceiving.
She didn't say it, but she could picture him pocketing
a necklace carelessly left in a jewelry box during a big party.
Or a Seiko watch from under a poolside towel.
She didn't imagine him planning a heist,
but just taking what came his way.
Returning her smile, he said..

[Aceyalone]
Bout that money, yeahhh.. that's what I'm talkin bout
Bout that money, gettin that money

[Chorus]
Blink Blink - every time you open up your eyes
Blink Blink - every time you open up your mind
Blink Blink - yeahhh, yeahhh
What the fuck are people talkin bout?

Blink - every time you open up your eyes
Blink Blink - every time you open your mind
Blink Blink - yeahhh, yeahhh
What the fuck these people talkin bout?

[Aceyalone]
I say it once, I'll say it again
Cold cash money make the whole world spin
You can laugh, and you can grin
But you ain't sayin shit if you ain't got ends
So hold your breath, and wait for God
And when you get here, tell him that you need a job
Because shit is hard, in the battlefield
And the next bid'ness deal can get you killed

[Chorus]

[Aceyalone]
The phone's in my name and it can't be cut off
The water and the power and it can't be shut off
Food, shelter, cheese, I gotta break off, please
I gotta shake off, that's why I gotta take off
I'm young and full of vigor, West coast nigga
Tryin to make my pockets bigger from the shit that I deliver
Stay afloat, sell your boat
Sell what you wrote, fuck it, sell dope

Yeahhh, yeahhh, what the fuck are people talkin bout?
... yeahhh, what the fuck do people think about?

[Chorus] - 3/8X

[Aceyalone]
You should put on a mask, and go in home savings
Witcho' nuts and yo' heart and yo' forty-five waving
Westsiders got West cravings
God damn motherfuckin money is amazing

Yeahhh.. you know money money in everything
... you know money make the world go round
... you know money runnin everythang
... you know money make the world go round
... you know money runnin everythang
... you know money make the world go, round

Blink.. {*echoes*}</pre>
