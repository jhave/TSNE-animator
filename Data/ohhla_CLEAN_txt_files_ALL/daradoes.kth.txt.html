Yeah, I used to come on the block, and many girls would jock
Trojans and rubbers on dashboards, and lips that get hot
Dangle, brother sippin E&amp;J tango
Suckers how you flex too, standin right next to
freaks takin X too, nah nah nahh
Blast speakers in your car, roll down the street with Big Pete
With heat, four double-R's compete
Tracks behind you bass backin you, all girls down for you
Suckers get clowned for you, I drop pounds for you
Sound for you, rock'n'roll around for you

Walk through the door, Maury shoes on the floor
Alligators for players, droppin lines for sayers
Brothers only see favors, transportin the fort
The biggest case in the court, counter-actin butt-smackin
Game plans you kinda lackin with Stetson hats, combats
We went with baseball bats, walk in studio with tapes and DATs
Leave you standin on doormats, next to cats and dead rats
Tecs make you jump like acrobats
Alphabetical order, A to Z clientele 3-D
You can't see me smokin beadies sippin Riunite on ice
I'm nice, that's right kid pay the price
Pay the price..
