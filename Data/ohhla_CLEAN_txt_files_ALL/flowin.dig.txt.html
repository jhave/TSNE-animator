[Shock G]
Now this trip's to let you know the Underground can flow
We'll go toe-to-toe with any bro that wants to go
But those who go need to know that we're an elite fleet
of very unique MC's and as a treat Jeremy programmed a beat
that I could flow on. I'ma go on; the D-Train's about to roll on
The day I pulled out my fat marker and I wrote on
The windows of the train, wrote my name, bout to do the walls
Had to pause, cause, two police
officers get on, they barely fit on - the train was packed
We're standing back-to-back cause there was nothing left to sit on
I'm looking around to see who's down - realize I'm all alone
Mostly people coming home from work, a couple of sisters and a fag
Yes, this would have been a drag
but I'm chilling with my tall can in my brown bag
And I'm sipping, your boy Shock was cold dipping
Sipping real slow and dipping real low so 5-O don't be tripping
Check it though, a minute or two later
I finished my brew with nothing to do, broke out cold made a
Pimp move to the next car looking for trouble
Rub the stubble under my chin and squeezed in between
A pair of big, bubble butt freaks:
Two Russet potato and bacon eating sisters
One had too much make-up on but yo, I didn't diss her
Cause she was kind of cool though
Both of them was cool enough to do you know
We picked more people up at Broadway Station
Being down I had to clown and make use of a situation
So I'm rubbin the girls booty behind me
Right near the bottom where the booty and thigh meet
My middle finger's riding down the line of the seam of her jeans
But she don't seem to mind me
But then she shocked me, almost clocked me
Tried to slap me, caught her hand and said
"You better be glad my name is Shock G,
 Cause if my name was Dre, from N.W.A.
 I'd cold slap your ass and tell you have a nice day."
She said, "Wait a minute, Shock G! I know that name
I seen you on Arsenio, what you doing on the train?"
I said "I'm trying to stay normal." She said "Really? That's a winner,
I'm studying law, don't live too far, would love to cook you dinner."
I said "Cool. Bring your friend, I like the both of youse two."
I knocked the boots, the sneakers and the house-shoes

It's like that baby, ya don't stop
Cause my name is Shock you know that I like to rock
One time
Yeah, you got the sound of the Underground
doing it to you in your ear orifice
(Yeah, don't you know 
the Underground's doin it to ya flowin on the D-Line)
Yo, 2Pac is in the house. Got a big grin on his face
Jay-Z, cut that shit up stupid</pre>
