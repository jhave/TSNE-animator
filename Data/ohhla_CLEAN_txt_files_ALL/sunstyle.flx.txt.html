Ain't no rapper who could stifle this
I'm twice as triflin, as Satan's worst disciple is
Better get that through your head right quick
Better yet, you get your crew if the ?shred's by picks?
Out of nowhere, cats with no fear, show fear
Trust me after that, them cats ain't tryin to go there
when the real dogs lock jaws to the death
I'm all up in the pits runnin hundred dollar bets
Here to collect is the ironhead clad rep
In the days, I waved heat at heatwave for half step
My Boogie Nights in the hood be tight cause
my goods be right, I Suge all Knight, twenty-four like
Servin the raw type of smack-a-lak
Havin these new jacks laid out flat, on they back
Wakin up askin what was that just hit em
This ironhead spittin on the Funk Flex rhythm

Knahmean?  It's your man King Sun
Funk Flex volume three
Cause them other cats straight up pussy
Let me find that</pre>
