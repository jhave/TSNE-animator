OWWW!
Damn it (damn it girl)
You know you got it goin on

and you're so fine that your body need a bodyguard
Well I can be your hubby

Let me beam you up like Scotty, I got Whitney 
just enough for everybody in this party girl

[Chorus]
Da da da, dah, dah

[Lil Wayne]
Yep, I'm +In Like Flynn+

Yeah, if she can't swim
I got'cha girl sinkin in my Benz
Backstroke, backstroke
Like Michael Phelps with my backstroke
Break her off 'til her back broke
I leave her numb like crack folk
Then I get to the money, Monday through Sunday
Anxiously like what it do honey
Me-na-ge, watch honey do honey
And then they do me and I'm glad they done it
Yeah, I'm with D-R-E
The nigga that make beats with that nigga

We so motherfuckin cool-er, than you

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

You can see by the way that she walk
and you're so fine that your body need a bodyguard
Well I'm your Kevin Costner
And I will be the boxer
I would love a bite, cause shorty out of sight
And I just wanna watch her

[Chorus]
