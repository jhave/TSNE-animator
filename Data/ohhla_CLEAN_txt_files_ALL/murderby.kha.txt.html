[Tragedy Khadafi]
La ilaha ilallah Allah
The GemStar Akbar till I daily depart
Niggas locked in, Clarence 13X my doctrine
Boil like Pyrex pots wit rocks dropping
Word to Ronnie Bump heard he holding meals in lumps
And up North he lost mad aura fucking wit chumps
88 numbers, state green, OG reclining
Accurate timing, plus he's in the same house that I'm in
Team got murdered; fuck the 30 bricks on consignment
And he's playing his gate telling niggas how he shining
But um... handle ya b.i.
He fake 2-5 just like he T.I.
He stay getting hazed on the V.I.

[Milk Murder]
Yeah I'm outta the dark
I knew he was a mark from the start
That's one of the main reason you should tear 'em apart
Ain't trying to say the wrong things on this Government phone
I'm thinking intelligently cuz I would rather you home
More less, yo this nigga been a dawn in my side
Him and some other niggas tried to torture my Crhyme
Same as that cat who wears waves to the side
African hat, black, in Cadillac when he ride
Use to fuck wit Bridgette
This old head bitch from Memphis
She took 'em to the Dirty-Dirty
Heard he caught a shipment, 30 or 40 G's
They buried all the fiends
And chopped up everybody that's directly on the team
But um... neva gave a fuck my soul is cold
Hit 'em wit the bone-crush and let 'em hold the pole
I know you in the pen, hate to put the strain on you
But this nigga gotta be clipped and now the game on you

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Ayo roger that, flatline till I holla back
187 skyline he's mine, I got a buncha savages
All you gotta do is send 'em packages
And they'll run 'em out the house wrapped in bandages
More less he'll get confronted, tell me how you want it?
Got long bangaz, it's nothing just to plug 'em in his stomach
Catch 'em while he sleeping 
Wait until the Weekend of my visit till you hit wit that hazing 
That diesel to keep me living

[Milk Murder]
Yeah, I'ma send Rachael, she hoe way well
Make sure you put one in the back of his neck like a gray whale

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Yo why she leaving as we speak?
I got my gun right now
Matter of fact fall back here he come right now</pre>
