Yo what's up
What's going down
Let's start it up
It's not too late
It's not too late
To start it up

Yo what's up
What's going down
Let's start it up
It's not too late
It's not too late
To start it up

Buckle up, here comes the shakedown
We gon' turn it up, listen to the bass pound
You got to react, high to the high hat
Bounce to the boom bap, we gon' make your soul tap
When we came through y'all was all mellow, mo
We motivated a marsh pit like heavy metal
Rock crowds from punk rock to soul
And bring funk to monks and aunts and uncles
What you getting good?
We da real mother funkers
Funk what you thunk we the ones that a funk up
Cadillac trunk filled with B-E-P bumpers
Now comprehend like ? thumpers

Yo what's up
What's going down
Let's start it up
It's not too late
It's not too late
To start it up

Yo what's up
What's going down
Let's start it up
It's not too late
It's not too late
To start it up

Rock hard hard rock
Bombard your whole block
Reinforce my fleet, the funk is non-stop
Dance stars dance hard, I'm back with Weekends
Tied a place in your face with shit thats leaving
Yeah we be the main source serving up the main course
Don't stop, planet rock, light source by the force
Bang-bang, boogie-boogie up jump the jumpstart
Ignite to take flight we rocked ya depart (where?)
To the third part (what?) it's a trilogy
(???)
What you didn't know
Ay yo we bring the bumps
Bumps for your trunk and we making the funk-funk

Yo what's up
What's going down
Let's start it up
It's not too late
It's not too late
To start it up

Yo what's up
What's going down
Let's start it up
It's not too late
It's not too late
To start it up

Yo we up again, listen up
It's the Peas with the sound
We's about the break out
Shake the whole Earth now
Bass down up and loud whenever we get..
Set it off in your town
Let ya know we all pound
Whoever you are we gonna make you do it
Whatever you do it just stop
And dance to this
This is the diggy-diggy-diggy-diggy rock-rock
This is the diggy-diggy-diggy-diggy crew-crew</pre>
