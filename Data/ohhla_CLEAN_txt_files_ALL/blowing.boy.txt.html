[Intro: Bei Maejor]
Yeah, I said this one for your stereo
Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up, turn me
Yeah yeah, I say-say this one for your stereo
Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up
Shout out sexy ladies, this right here your song
Hopped inside your car and turned your radio on
Shout out sexy ladies, this right here is your song
Hop inside your car and turn that radio on

[Chorus: Bei Maejor]
She blowin me kisses, she blowin me kisses
I'm sittin and reminiscin, thinkin, dreamin
She blowin me kisses, she blowing me kisses
I'm sittin and reminiscin, thinkin, dreamin
About us

[Soulja Boy]
I can take you places-places you have never been
Caribbean, feet in the sand
I-I can take you 'round the world
and you can be my girl, and I can buy you pearls
and you can tell your girlfriends, how I put it down
And it's like a movie everytime I come around
When I'm in your city, man I shut the town down
Tell the whole world that I'm hot right now
Shout out sexy ladies, this right here your song
Hop inside that car and turn your radio on
Shout out sexy ladies, this right here  your song
Hop inside that car and turn your radio on

[Soulja Boy]
Yeah~! She like me, I like her
Yah, knew-knew I would've wifed her
Who woulda thought that, she woulda been like
the other half of me, what a sight to see
Me and her travelin, all across the world
I can be her man, she can be my girl
Turn the radio on, she kissin me through the phone
When I see her it's on, when I say that it's on
Shout out sexy ladies, this right here your song
Hop inside that car and turn your radio on
Shout out sexy ladies, this right here your song
Hop inside that car, and turn your radio on

[Chorus]</pre>
