Typed by: AZ Lyrics

4... 3..
Uptown roamers, and south side riders
Up up up uptown up up uptown up up uptown [x4]

[Wale]
(Yea! We got a lot of star power in the building tonight
Rock, Mikey what up? Trey what up? Yea! Here we go!
Forest Creek what up, Glenarden what up, Cap Heights what up
Barry Farms what up, Lincoln Heights what up, Michigan what up
Montana we ain't playin with em! Aww!)

[Verse 1]
District has arrived us, (ah) time to shine
Yea, I am the nail forever holdin em down
Down in the slums to the burbs, where they migrate
Who the one they talkin bout? That's what I thought, WALE!
A long way from a grammy, I'm a get it
I promise the moment it's with me I'll leave it in the District
Yea, and I'm just doin what I gotta do, flyer than the rest of em
I still got my Nike boots
Let me enlighten you, I am the brightest of the youth
The booth can't do it I provide to it
It's by youth with the mind of a G
I never cook coke, no sir that ain't me (nah)
But I'm so DC, and Maryland, Virginia
Dem other bammas pussy like placenta
The center of the East coast my emblem reads
4-3... yea, remember that please
Uptown roamers, and south side riders
Up up up up uptown up up up town up up up town [x2]
(Wale: yea yea yea yea, ay ay ay, Yea. Landova what up, 1-2-4 what up
1st Quarter what up, KentLand what up, Texas Ave what up
Largo what up, Trinidad gettin cash fa sho, yea)

[Verse 2]
It's DC, brought to you by me
The only thing higher than the crime rate is the fiends
Semen get leaked to the women of the future
The ladies baby boomin before they high school juniors
Yea, and these niggaz don't be steppin up
Baby mothers quittin school, nigga now it's up to her
Believe ya'll, I ain't tryna Stephen King ya'll
But most stay high with they eyes like the Singapores
I'm singin poems for supporters of my songs
And all them out-of-towners
Just to show you how we goin
The poor to the ballers, Ardwick Ardmore
The Forest Creek stars, even ya'll out in Rockville
The home of Marvin Gaye, that's all I gotta say
Iverson was cool, but I supported Victor Page
It's the DC thang, incase you ain't notice
Landova, Saratoga, and I'm Uptown..
Uptown roamers, and south side riders
Up up up up uptown up up up town up up up town [x4]

[Verse 3]
Yes, it's Wale
Currently out in Maryland
I should be in the carry-out
Truthfully I am ever fresh
I'm everesant, nobody do it better
They all are pretenders, I am the 7th letter
(WALE! WALE!)
Yea, and that's my name, they ain't forgot it
The 9th letter's forgotten, you will never be acknowledged

[Verse 4]
I get it poppin like Pacman, ask Polo
Ask G, he'll tell you that I'm into Go-Go
Ask Mikey, he'll tell you that the hoes like me
My Prada lows, for the most part it's only Nike
Some spite me, but they try to be a lot alike me
You goin have to sell some more records, niggaz, stop tryin'
Uptown roamers, and south side riders
Up up up up uptown up up up town up up up town [x4]
[In Background] (don't, don't, don't, don't hate him
don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't hate him, don't)
[Background] (ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay) [repeat until end]
Uptown roamers, and south side riders
Up up up up uptown up up up town up up up town [repeat until end of song]</pre>
