Yeahhhhhhhhhhh - woop woop, woop woop
Ha ha, fuck the police!

[Young Buck]
Thank about it, everytime you bitches come around
Either we runnin or we layin on the fuckin ground
Just look at Chris, a nigga popped him, shot him in the club
They called the ambulance and y'all didn't even show up
Or let me tell you 'bout Lil' Ricky when he took his bullets
You want the trigger man?  Y'all was the one that pulled it
That's why we represent them niggaz like Larry Davis
Before he let you cowards kill him he just aimed and sprayed it
Now what'chu wan' do?  Bitch I got a gun too
We gon' keep on sendin shots, every time y'all come through
Got the nerve, tell a nigga put his hands up
Then beat him to the ground, when you put the boy in handcuffs

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Fuck fuck the police, we handle it ourself
Even if I bleed to death - nigga we don't need no motherfuckin help
And to the right (what) to the left (what)
Let 'em know (what) we don't need no motherfuckin help
Fuck the police (woop woop) fuck the law (woop woop)
Fuck the police (woop woop) fuck 'em all - we don't need no motherfuckin help
Fuck the police (woop woop) fuck the law (woop woop)
Fuck the police (woop woop) fuck 'em all - we don't need no motherfuckin help

[Young Buck]
We used to play, cops and robbers as a little kid
Whoever was the pigs, we would go and split his wig (ha ha!)
Then as the years passed, niggaz only got worse
Jumped into the gang shit, gotta protect our turf
We had enough of gettin handcuffed and pulled over
We started tryin, knocked they heads off they fuckin shoulders
Now where my soldiers at, get ready for combat
I'm livin like them niggaz that done went to Vietnam {?}
So if you try to lock me up for smokin my weed
The whole force of police, is what they gon' need
One of a kind, I'm the last of a dyin breed
Even the one that was befo' me, he was sayin

[Chorus]

[Young Buck]
When I'm New York I'm hollerin nigga we don't need no motherfuckin help
Yeah; when I'm in Tennessee I'm hollerin we don't need no motherfuckin help
Yeahhh, when I'm out in L.A. nigga we don't need no motherfuckin help
Yeahh, A-T-L all day, nigga we don't need no motherfuckin help</pre>
