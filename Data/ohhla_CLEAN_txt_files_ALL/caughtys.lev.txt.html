[Chorus]
We caught you swingin', oh yeah
"All together now"
We caught you swingin', oh yeah
We caught you swingin', oh yeah
"All together now"

[Verse One] [Stenge]
Well it's the dime bitches, any bitches, Stengy will crack
Gettin' dap for bustin' raps put my name on the map
Now the honey's wanna clap to this
Cause I rap to this
But back in my old days I got dissed
Like my name was Fanella
But now I can spell a
Grip
So I got dips on my tip
But when I road a Civy cashback I gots no pub
And now they all on nutsack like a service state scrubber
Rubba dub dub in the tub with my scuba gear
Cause honeys here be gamin' on niggas like forest deer
And niggas clingin', wanna step in the ringin
Bet you bought my tape homie
I caught you swingin'

[Ced]
Don't even try to fake it you know that I got cha
Got cha
Swingin' on them thangs
I caught ya
Again
Is it habit formin'?
Did you get enough?
Would you like some more?
Cause I don't give a...
I'm the mellow man listen to a cello band
Honeydips holdin' my nuts hand over hand
Nothin' alarms me
Sportin' Armani 
Suits
(We think Ced is cute)
So when you're spectatin'
Don't be perpetratin' 
Already caught a glimpse
So what are you waitin'
For
Come on over here and cling
It don't mean a thing if you can't make 'em swing

[Chorus] [x2]
We caught you swingin', oh yeah
We caught you swingin', oh yeah
"All together now"

[Verse Two] [Bambino]
I'm Bambino, the mystic
Adolescent misfit
Swingers gettin' lipstick all on my dipstick
I've been a victim of swingers
Many of times
Over many a rhymes
And many will find
But many of guys
That ain't wise
Swingin' on a nigga cause he's televised
Or musified 
Cause on the classified
It just don't work like you're past your pride so
Check my rep, I'll sip my Dr. Pep
Watchin' this honey peep as she step
I'm lookin' at her eyes
Peakin' to the left
Struttin' that ass and I'm cashin' my check
Before she broke her neck I ask, "Have we met?"
She saw my video on the T.V. set
She's a fan of rap music, so I said, "Bet"
Ask, "Would you like to get hot?"
Sex was her favorite
So I stayed a bit
We cut to the crib
And then I laid there
We got a million honeys behind every swingin' door
100,000 panties in collection drawers
Got 10,000 more when we went on tour
From a 1,000 fans swingin' on the floor
"Maybe their fallin' in love"
So honeys don't push and shove

[Chorus]
We caught you swingin', oh yeah
We caught you swingin', oh yeah
"All together now"
We caught you swingin', oh yeah
We caught you swingin', oh yeah
"All together now"
We caught you swingin', oh yeah</pre>
