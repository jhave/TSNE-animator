[Verse-1]

As they shackled and chained me for a murder case
Out the hood on my way to CYA
And from CYA to the Pembrooke
If they find the murder weapon I get 10 more
But just like a g I remained calm
No witnesses a few more weeks I'll be going home
But as the fucking police car drove off g
I started thinking about my motherfucking family
About the dope game must of been the wrong move
I still here my pops saying nigga stay in school
But once you shackled and chained ain't no turning back
You get in front of the judge nigga you can tell your facts
I fell asleep in the back of the cop car
Woke up ?? bout a mothafucking phone call
And as they booked me I had a mouthful of crack
And when I shit tonight bitch I'm gone get it back
I must be daydreaming I'm thinking about my bitch
Til this motherfucker woke me up and cough quick
And as they checked me butt naked and balls dangling
With 50 other motherfuckers in the shower saying
 

Yo man check this out
You gotta sleep with one eye open and one eye closed fool
This your first time in jail nigga gone need some friends
By the way youngster what's your name

 

[Verse-2]

You can call me killer on the streets its the dopeman
And like Scarface you gotta let your nuts hang
I put my glock up to a fool don't move g
See in 94 suckers catching lugies
But ain't nobody tripping on the black man
You either learn to dope deal or you gang bang
See in the ghetto a life don't mean shit
And most blacks they don't know about politics
And once you marked for death than your ass is smoked
Cause niggas dying young in the ghetto
Gang banging that can get you 40 to life
So choose your casket red, blue or white
And once you gone ain't no motherfucking coming back
The way you live is the way you gone die black
Glocks pulled on this sucker for selling dope
Nigga owe me money so you know he gotta go
Fucking with my stash I'm gone kick that ass
Spend 17 rounds as they stuff him in a bodybag
Even though I know I'm living fucking ignorant
I guess that's the shit that got me in the pen
But since I'm in, I guess I got to hold my ground
Make a second case so motherfuckers ?? down
Hit the weights on a motherfucking daily basis
And keep my mouth closed and always remember faces
Cause once you in jail you ain't nothing but a number black
You never know when the fucker going to call you back
I'd rather sleep in some motherfucking quick sand
They killed my celly have you ever held the hands of a dead man 
 
(Chorus x4)
Have you ever held the hand of a dead man</pre>
