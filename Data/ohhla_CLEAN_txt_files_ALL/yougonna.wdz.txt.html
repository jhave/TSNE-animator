{*sped up sample to open: "You, and you, and you, and you
And you're gon' you're gon' you're gon' you're gon'
You're gon' you're gon' you're gonna love me!"*}

[over sample]
Wussup Sho'Nuff boi!
Yup, yup, Milwaukee kick your feet up nigga

[Big Marc]
I'm comin down with the key to Decatur
East Atlanta slab rider, heavy grinder for paper (yup!)
City-slicker, heavyweight in the game
Froze wrist and earlobes, heavy weight in my chain (yup!)
Hittin the game where you niggaz be slackin
Got the 'dro for the low, that's what my niggaz be sackin
My, shell toes peddle Chevy's and boles
White leathers on the Cutlass with mahogany flo's
I'm ridin through Oakhurst, coated like Starburst
Candy paint glisten, lookin greasy like bratwurst (oh!)
The dude on my jersey is gray or deceased
You rested in peace, for snitchin to Decatur police
Servin niggaz with a ghetto subpoena
Got that A-Town stompin back in Phillips Arena (A-Town stomp)
I'm, passin hoes like collection plates
And keep a broad on my squad who won't section eight (oh!)

{*sped up sample: "You, and you, and you, and you
And you're gon' you're gon' you're gon' you're gon'
You're gon' you're gon' you're gonna love me!"*}

[over sample]
Yeah, okay; yeah, okay
They gon' love me after this one shawty, f'real man

[Sho'Nuff]
All my trap niggaz, and 'dro smokers
Keep the strippers stay focused pussy poppin and rollin (woo!)
Cause all I wear is hats with A's
Shoppin at malls, white tees, Cartiers (yup!)
Jeans creased up, straight out the cleaners
Plus my George Jefferson strut and my Southern demeanor
When they see me when I speak my slang
Everybody wanna know my name (Sho'Nuff)
I was - born in Atlanta, raised in Decatur
Where we, pushin LeSabres and blow like inhalers
Say he, kinda skinny with a full size jimmy
Ay man, I got broads in different cities like gimme gimme
They used to treat me like, Urkel the nerd
Now they flock when they see my LeBrons on the curb (look here)
See my upholstery, it got women approachin me
Some look like they too old for me, TV's hangin appropriately

{*sped up sample: "You, and you, and you, and you
And you're gon' you're gon' you're gon' you're gon'
You're gon' you're gon' you're gonna love me!"*}

[over sample]
It's Major Way baby
I told you you was gon' love me pimpin
Uhh, yeah, AW-AHH! {*echoes*}

[Milwaukee Black]
When you see me in the six-trey drop
And I tell you that the price of the work just dropped (yup!)
I let the thang go pop...
I caught buddy round there snitchin off to the cops (yup!)
And the game don't stop (don't stop)
You tried to see my dough, you better see this fo' (get it?)
I'm thirty-one and my rappin is done
I got a million dollar company to run, BEOTCH!

[Sho'Nuff]
Cause I smoke like you, I'm into some blue
I buy 'em, lick 'em, split 'em, roll 'em just like you (yup!)
In XXL, Murder Dog, The Source, on +Vibes+
I'm +Rolling Stones+ in late model rides homey

[Big Marc]
I'm +Grand Hustlin+, +Disturbin Tha Peace+
I'm +So Def+ puttin +Organized Noize+ in the streets, yeahhhh
I'm smokin earth tones, Chong &amp; Cheech
You beat your meat, at home while I bone your freak (oh!)

{*sped up sample: "You, and you, and you, and you
And you're gon' you're gon' you're gon' you're gon'
You're gon' you're gon' you're gonna love me!"*}

[over sample]
Told ya, you gon' love me!
