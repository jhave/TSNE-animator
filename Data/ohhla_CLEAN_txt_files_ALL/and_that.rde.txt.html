[Abstract Rude]
It's deep, estuary, I'm the devil's advisary, comma
[Prevail]
Drama, the three of us are pyramids period
[Moka Only]
Hearing it we bring you to the point of exclamation
[All]
And that you can quote

[Prevail]
Some people eat mice, all covered with lice
While I watch Poltergeist, some people of Christ
Crumb roaches and night fall, call it to height
If you will still believe in shadows and thrills
Watch the tight line of light that divides the gilds
Where the masons build up on Haunted Hill
No lights on the grill, black Coupe De Ville
About twelve o'clock midnight, window sill
Where the winds don't will, think a prince won't set
To think we might reach Mars but haven't figured it yet
The deeper it gets, the more minds must inquire
Streets are ablaze, no jobs and slashed tires
Can't walk by us, we still hold the buyers
Ab, Mok, and P-1's for choir of lions
Fire and iron, everything that melts and bends
It's credible, criminal stakes cut you a friend
Lost lake in the end, high voltage revenge
Cold stabbed with a pen
Will battles till the end
We are

[Abstract Rude]
Deep, estuary, I'm the devil's advisary, comma
[Prevail]
Drama, the three of us are pyramids period
[Moka Only]
Hearing it we bring you to the point of exclamation
[All]
And that you can quote

[Abstract Rude]
The petrie dish is placed onto the microscope
Scientists will examine what will provoke
A whole nation of humans resulted in ruins
The land by man, disrespected, disease infected
Some communities go unprotected
And every year welcomes a pledge for new beginning
But do we come out winning, lives are ending
Surrendering and being hindered
When do we remember, how do we forget
Our true gender without regret
Science commits homicide, crack new born baby dies
From the desire of intoxication while impregnated, eyes
Are way bigger than that fat tummy
Needed exchange explains the reign of money
The funny, the fickle and the wishy-washy are a little silly
Posse of people, their philosophy is evil
Can you possibly see through
The beaurecracy, the big troop to the X of this revolution

[Abstract Rude]
Deep, estuary, I'm the devil's advisary, comma
[Prevail]
Drama, the three of us are pyramids period
[Moka Only]
Hearing it we bring you to the point of exclamation
[All]
And that you can quote

[Moka Only]
Within the depths of this wood panneled room
This council sits with charts and graphs and prepares the news
Monthly reports fanned a fresco for you enthusiasts
My blues is the moodiest, truly is an uncommon understanding
One twelfth of Zodiac with eratic planning
Solo yet unified, and so low you drill and drill
But can't reach the bottom of my soul, although you have tried
And some of you just want to know how it all takes
Taking apart to inspect, but don't know how to fix
Some things should just be left a mystery
History repeats itself frequently and causes misery
The people in the middle just dribble away
The eyes on the tower know exactly where you stay
This man in the mirror doesn't know what to do
Except repeat the little pieces that i've learned and given to you
Download it for you, you give it to them
See, there's more than one way to uproot than pull another stem
Crime can dissapear, but at what price
Where the ten lock you in for the night and turn out the lights
