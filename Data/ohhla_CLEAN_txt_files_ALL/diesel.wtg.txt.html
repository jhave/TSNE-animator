[Raekwon the Chef]
So yo yo all I want to do is just tell them cats
On the real, keep your game high man, keep it up
Word up, never stop your goals man, yaknowhatI'msayin?
(For real baby)
And, yo son, on the real I'ma get a sneaker just like y'all

[Ol Dirty Bastard]
I need help                     Because the black man is God
The government is after me      And the worst is, black man is the Devil
I need help                     So this is to bring everything in the
Someone help me please          universe within the light
Someone help me!                Understanding
They already did 2Pac           My children, all six billion humans
Biggie Smalls                   on the planet Earth
Someone help me!                Regardless of who or what, I love you
Someone help me please!         Word is bond, I love you

Ahh!  I'ma groupie for life, about nine wife
All the babies are mine, save a child life
No more doctors deliverin my babies
Stick in pins killing me slowly
To the President you say I'm a welfare fraud
you motherfucking right!  Let's burn this dark house white!
Insecure about my ding-dong, married to Babylon
My queen lookin at me like a pawn!

[Raekwon the Chef]
Splash the worst rehearse a verse Flashdance on the universe
Televise the work Network Shop til your neck hurt
Whattup Dirt, nine diagram phoenix on your sweatshirt
Thirty-thousand went bezerk, it's like clockwork
Rockport Mr. Raw God, hold the fort
Collect thoughts, elect sports, sideswipe, by the white horse
French cut, gleamin in the Benz truck, whattup
Tellin my mens what?  Ten times platinum and we ends up
draped out, jumpin out a cake, now throw your tape out
Furniture style, holdin the mic we got it laid out
Mind iodine Einstein remind mine
People swam nine didn't know they own kind wrong time
Denim rap, competition quick, handle that
Suckin the jim hat, pervertin on my raps'll get you slidapped
Mix drink Cuban Link lizink, flip a to zinc
Plus, expensive like a roman mink, now think

[Ol Dirty Bastard]
An ugly thirty-six chamber degree, what, you wanna rhyme?
Deep bring 600 ABC through the love white hate line
I'm telling you tornado, 42 billion thought travel
The year 90's parallel, controls to the wakes
I dig woman's stomach swell, my borough is dark
Many lights UFO kites, Benjamin Franklin got it right
Abraham I stuck your cherry tree
Your white head came out my black pussy
I ran Rip Van Winkle on all fours
Mountains twinkle twinkle star, Tarzan in a jar
And then came out Jane Flintstone in my gravel pit

[Method Man]
Kill the chatterin, niggaz bust shots, keep em scatterin
Blood splatterin, on point like a javelin
Fuck battlin, you cats is only good for babblin
Imaginin yourself, as the God space travellin
Round the seven rings of Saturn
Got my sword plus the Abbot in the chamber, nine in the clip
At the gatherin, we left you staggerin, yo it had to been
Hot Nickel, who broke bread, at the Vatican
Stick a pin, in a citizen, mental food, got us diggin in
My compliments to the chef
M-E-TH like amphatimens, yes stick it to the veteran
Blaow blaow!  Blown to death, take your medicines
I put the sick in your mu-sick with Osirus
Bound to blow like a bad sinus

[Ol Dirty Bastard]
Stay up at night don't sleep on your morn
Rest in the day because it's sunlight
Reverse thought psychology

[Prince Rakeem]
Child wild adventures walk trillions of square inches
Ten percentage try to drain me of my mental strengthage
Heavy wattage knowledge cleans blood clottage, and retardage
I refine the garbage logic exterminate your cottage

[U-God]
Thirty-six anger, dirty language is the stranger
The mangler, the honor roll singer righteous finger
When we shine-a, we always find a never minor major
Hard to spot we dangerous with our behavior

[Prince Rakeem]
Australian Venezuelaen illegal aliens
Chameleons all catch the feelings we revealing
Killer bee keep your mind at ease, lay back like Adam fuckin Eve
Four thousand years in the garden, puffin trees

[U-God]
I aim slang I maintain, through the main vein
The answer came clever, when we do greatness through trial and error
Mile of terror motormouth, let the odor out
Fumin greater, the temper in my spine huminator
The super grass childish blast sleepy eye stash
The hashish masterpiece, Osirus is the virus
This split second splash, severe drop is near pop
There's fallin teardrops, now is it worth your career?</pre>
