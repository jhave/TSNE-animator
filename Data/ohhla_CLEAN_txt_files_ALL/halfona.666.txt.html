Half on a sack or some blow
Half on a sack or some blow
Bring them tones and plenty P

(Lil E)
Its the pimp ass nigga that told you once before but now Im tellin ya twice
Never try to test me when Im high and full of that got damn white
Cause when Im full of that dope I'm already prepared to stomp ya fuckin click
And if you think you got guts enough to come try me,bring it on lil bitch
Bustas out there tradin on like they heavyweights and all that
But they dont know that Mack E's scopin they stash and ready to take they cash
Leavin em dead broke wit they pockets full wit nuttin but lent
Wonderin how in the fuck did they just got they muthafuckin wig split
Then they sittin there thinkin on how they gonna try and find Lil E
Mane Lil E gone be somewhere low key gettin full of that got damn P
Yeah I said that fuckin P,just in case yall didnt know
Dont be surprised to hear that this young nigga's gettin full of that coke
Always gamin to take somethin from and rob a lil punk ass bitch
Robbin em blind and stompin that bitch and droppin em in the got damn ditch
So you bitches betta back up when Lil E come limpin thru the door
Catch up wit yo kind like I said get the fuck away from me hoe

(Chorus)4x
Half on a sack or some blow
Half on a sack
Half on a sack or some blow
Bring them tones and plenty P

(Lil E)
Aww shit
That bitch
The Lil' E bitch the one that click
That thick wit some of my kinfolk
When me and Three 66 gone cum and keep us one of them dirty hoes
Dirty hoes just like to suck on dick to commense to swallow the nut
You can shoot that nut all in they face mane they dont give a fuck
Tellin ya bout this Lil E, Three 66 shit it aint no lie
All my niggas just like to pack them gats and constantly get so high
Now these are the killas Three 66 niggas and naked drippers
Plus we got plenty P and the tone
Robbin you bitches and hoes is how I'm comin for the 99
Beatin yo punk ass down and makin you catch up wit yo got damn kind
Hoe you betta tell me where tha muthafuckin cheese at
Or I'm lettin this bullet go thru yo chest and then blow out yo back
Give me what I want bitch and I'm a be thru and gone
Leavin yo punk ass broke assed out and all alone
Now I done already let you know ahead of time what Im gonna do
Betta watch yo back cause Lil E and Three 66 on you fool

(Chorus) till fade</pre>
