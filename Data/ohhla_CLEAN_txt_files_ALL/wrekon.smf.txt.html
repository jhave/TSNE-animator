[Tek]
What up? I heard that you got a little prob'
Wit the way that we roll and the heads we done robbed
Stickin and flickin the bangers, throw them out to ya neck
Another beat down inflicted by that nigga Tek
And for ya back, establish, yea I got a sharp dagger
And a left hook that'll cause ya jaw bone to shatter
Whose skilled enough to come test the weeded two
Titans from Bucktown, that'll burn through ya crew
I got a vibe from the cession in the back
When niggas is shaft on the ground puffin meth and kickin raps
Smif-N-Wessun comin wit nuff buds and skunk
Fake the funk and get found dead in the trunk

[Chorus 4X]
All heads realize, wrekonize
Real heads on the rise, wrekonize
You better wrekonize

[Steele]
Back again, make room for the boom
Puffin the lye, gettin high to a beat minus two
Choke my yak, is where I lives at and lotta rats (cooch and pain)
Is my brain so I don't sweat that
Instead I mack wit a Tek and a Dog, my man Ruckus and Rock
And yo Rippa what up doc?

[Tek]
The deals going down like this
Non affect the mouth, watch ya lips and my boots do a french kiss
Puttin an end to those who tend to get me aggravated
I'm tired of countin dues and addin up the years we waited
Be on the lookout for these mad blunts smokin
Keep ya girl away from me, cuz I won't hesitate to stroke it

[Chorus 4X]

[Steele]
I'm feelin the rush from the cannabis plant
But I can't lamp cuz niggas get me amped
Talkin this and that but my raps formats phat
And I slap cats that come miss the stand backs
Never could I ever agree on
Cuttin loose a lot of mic troops that I roll wit for eons
Be on ya tippy top or ya crisply crop
By them crooked cops or the local cop blockers on ya block
I watch my back when for delf
Some say the buzz, but I say the fuzz bad for my health
Huh, critics could get banged like did it
Bowl, first I get lifted wit my click before up in a show
So, I, say what I mean, mean what I say
Do what I do, and me not play
Say young God for punks who play hard
Don't be surprised I'm pullin ya card, ya better wrekonize

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
