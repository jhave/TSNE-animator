Intro: Puff Daddy

     I'ma make you dance
And we won't stop, cause we can't stop (repeat 3X)
     Don't stop
     KRS-One
     Puff Daddy
     Bad Boy remix
     Hit me baby

Verse One: Puff Daddy, KRS-One

Hear the sound of my money machine
See the 600 Benz see the chrome rims gleam
See the teacher KRS and the Puff Daddy
See the young black and famous Rich like Matty
With the power and the knowledge at our fingertips
With a style make the ladies wanna lick they lips, shake they hips
Shake they rumps, bass thump
Believin they could fly by the way you jump, player, uhh
Hip-Hop mayor, fat rhyme sayer
From the Boogie Down to the Himilayas I'm

Comentating (say what?) illustrating (yeah)
Descriptions given, adjective expert (I hear you)
Let's work, til your neck hurt (oooh)
Like Bedwork I Rock Steady, you ain't really ready
for the teacher, just when you thought you had me licked
I come equipped with another hit, oh shit!
(I hear you, I hear you, I hear you, I hear you)

Chorus: 

And we won't stop, cause we can't stop (repeat 4X)
        Step into a world, where there's no one left
        But the very best, no MC can test

        Step into a world, where there's no one left
        But the very best, no MC can test

Verse Two: Puff Daddy

Politic with the teacher (c'mon) as the hits reach ya
Puff Daddy and KRS-One, double feature (that's right)
Uptown diplomats, watch chips get stacked
So-and-so, this and that (uhh)
Just 'Show me the money!'  Ain't nuttin funny (uh-huh)
Have you stuck on stupid broke feelin crummy (ahah)
Ain't no time for Girl 6 
Cause I got a ten, holdin my stack of big Benz
Correographer causin your funky dope maneuver (say what?)
Bad Boy represent, keep it sewer
Killin You Softly wit my song
Call from the heist, I know y'all better think twice (what?)
about the still number one (uh-huh) South South Bronx (say what?)
At the Latin Quarter, dancin witcha daughter (ooh!)
You can't handle me, I keep it tight
With my Bad Boy family, that's right

Chorus:

And we won't stop, cause we can't stop (repeat 4X)
        Step into a world, where there's no one left
        But the very best, no MC can test

Verse Three: KRS-One

Uhh, uhh, South Bronx
You sitin and you wonderin, how we keep it comin in
KRS and Puff again to push it, and shove it in (that's right)
The neighborhood be buggin when we we comin in, rulin
(With more Wildcats than Rick Pitino, I mean yo)
Just Coolin', like Levert, I do work
They love me, thick with G. Simone, Puffy
Young black and educated, that's how we made it (oh yeah)
Study and bring the money in, you can't fade it
This scholar, gets the dollars
While these other scholars just holler (remix)
With no dinero, your zero (remix)
You think I care what you whisper
You got the wrong picture (remix)
I'm chillin with G. Simone eatin dinner (haha)
The 1997 winner, of your respect 
High tech, you get the album or cassette (that's right)
And don't forget, while you listenin, skills I flaunt it 
That Boogie Down Bronx shit, we on it

[Puffy]
Scott LaRock rest in peace, Biggie Smalls rest in peace
        Step into a world
We love y'all, always and forever, and we won't stop
        Where there's no one left
Cause we can't stop, and we won't stop
        Where the very best
BDP, Bad Boy
        No MC can test

Cause we can't stop, and we won't stop (repeat 4X)
        Step into a world, where there's no one left
        But the very best, no MC can test
(repeat last refrain to fade)

Rock on, Bad Boy, remix, for eternity baby, BDP rock on rock on...
