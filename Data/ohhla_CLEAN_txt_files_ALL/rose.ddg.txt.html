You used to like my style, I used to like your smile
I said I'll stay a sec, you said stay a while
You started sippin whine, said I was on your mind
I said I'm thinking of you too girl your hella fine
We hit the night time, for a late date
And everyday after that, for 8 months straight
We would roll tight, we had small fights
You shoulda seen how we are you done the street lights
I couldn't see your tears, from the pouring rain
You shoulda seen my body shake, when she said my name
She said I'm not the same, Andre ya changed
I said baby its pain from the rap game
We went our separate ways, man I was hurt for days
Man I didn't even call, I went through withdrawal
Flashbacks of her face hit me sometime
And I be wonderin man does she think of mine
I think of Rose

(Chorus)
Love is down through the hardest times
Sometimes I put Al Green on and think of Rose
Being with you is just a state of mind
Girl, thinking about you all the time

I saw her at a club, she was with a thug
She thought I would say hi, but I didn't show no love
The homey blazin bud, and now its getting live
But I knew that she knew, that I'd protect my pride
I see her watchful eye, from across the joint
And then she knew how I feel, if I heard her voice
And some ladies talked, and other ladies walked
But when it came to you girl, man there was a spark
Your whole anatomy man was like poetry
The very smell of your hair was like luxary
It was because of me, when the days was bright
I would come through with my silent nights
Man I think of Rose

(Chorus Repeat X2)</pre>
