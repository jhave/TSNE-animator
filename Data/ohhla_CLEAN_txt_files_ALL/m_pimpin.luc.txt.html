(Mr. Lucci)
Were from Dallas Texas, playaz we comin to take it ova
Millenium pimpin business, on 'em with 3 soljaz
Sellin dreams just like doja, fillin wishes my tensions
Just gettin ridges, to define my pimpin now I'm breakin bitches
As long as my money keep comin baby we could kick it
As long as pimpin keep pussy sellin I'm 'a flip it
A pimp stuck lifted, gifted, vicious mac
We quick to snap tricks with a blunt lip recognize this pimp shit.

(Remondtis)
Aint takin no bullshit from none of these bitches takin they riches takin they dough
Given 'em what they askin fo, contrtollin they mind, controllin they soul
Entise the hoe provoke the hoe, fuck the hoe then pimp the hoe
Grabbin her by her throat when she come short up on my cash flo.

(Mr. Lucci)
I got yo sister,yo mother, wifey excited lickin me nicely precisely nightly
In tightly robe wards is how she delight me, dont like me
Label me shistey but respected
I cant help when yo hoes wanna rest with these millenium pimps in Texas.

Chorus: x2
Now who are we?
The niggaz breakin bitches on the motherfuckin dime
Though we was responsible, we'll rob yo whole line
The late night phone calls, they keep you talkin quiet
Its millenium pimpin nigga thats how its goin down

(Remondtis)
I dont wanna ask but i will pass the deal phone to the next toe
Crook niggaz dont love hoes, we fuck hoes then toss hoes
I wuz smoked out when i saw her backstage at a concert
Yellow bone with no shoes on, tellin me to beat her
With her eyes locked on my creased jeans, my crook chain and my crook ways
She wanna blow my mind away and followin me since yestereday
Bank accounts with credit cards, you know she gave me all of that
Just to keep me payed then gave me head off in my Cadillac.

(Mr. Lucci)
Boy I snag hoes when I'm limpin, limpin, quick game and and I'm strippin, strippin
Nigga fanga toes or the hinney in it? Naw bitch its the pimpin in it
Got hoes doin hoes manashe trois puttin on shows on videos
So i can watch and sigh my candy coated rose.

(Shamike)
Now open yo mind and peep its pimpin biogaphy
Millenium pimpin we gots to be
Schoolin hoes for philosophy
My point is you better hit the streets
Blaze the sweet told that girl be back by 3
She came back with bout two G's, two hoes, and some fire.

Chorus: x2

(Mr. Lucci)
Now its the real deal, playalistic pimp shit goin down here
Im havin yo hoes do shit like silly tricks when you cant find the deal
2000 years a pimp and they see ya I'm tellin these hoes to simple they claim
You buyin 'em clothes and ice on they ring
Wonderin why you cant maintain
Im a perfect game, first the change I pimp the bitch then stay in her brain
Now shes purchasin chains, princess Jane, til yo shoes fit
Til you strangers all a part of it, been up audited, from the start of it
My main purpose is to work with, when only ideas is worth it.

(Shamike)
Say Miss lady I dont pimp for free paper pushin or we spendin G's?
Hold that, bitch and let me see what you workin with is what you need
Now the ultimatum is you make my money I'm a keepa 1 honey, honey
Pull another pellet, pellet on me, and blowin 'em off in my Volkswagon

(Remondtis)
I can pimp hoes with my eyes closed in a Cadillac or the Volvo
Spend game my big change to a white Chief or a Tahoe
With a chromed out Chevy Tahoe the mayella bone then laced out
TVs with flip screens we pimp hard then a ???

Chorus: x2</pre>
