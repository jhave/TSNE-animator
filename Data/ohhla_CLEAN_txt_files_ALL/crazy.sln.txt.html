Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Slaine]
This song is about goin crazy
Losin your fuckin mind
Stayin out too many days at a time
Yeah

I'm starin down a dark tunnel and I can't see the light
Rats crawlin everywhere, you know how they be at night
I got a gun in my hand, and I gotta squeeze it tight
I'm tryin to get out of here, no one said it's easy right?
My stomach is queasy like, I got a fuckin lump in my throat
More than a decade, I'm searchin and I'm huntin for hope
Soakin in alcohol, smokin usin somethin to cope
but how much water can you bail from your boat, 'fore it sinks?
My hijinks, made my eyes chink, pink from the lye stink
Pockets broke made want to rob things
Fuck this rap shit! My city's full of suicide kings
So from here on, this is now a do or die thing

[Chorus 2X: Slaine]
I got a baby on the way, mad bills to pay
But I took too many God damn pills today
And I can't get out of this haze, out of my bed
Can't get these sick thoughts outta my head - I'm goin crazy

[B-Real]
I don't wanna talk shit, but this weed in my pocket
is makin me crazy, just get me a straight-jacket and lock it
I'm fueled like a rocket, the topic of conversation
is I'm a little +Insane in the Brain+, and I can spark it
Like a suicide bomber, homey I'm ready to bomb it
Adrenaline takin over, think I'm gonna vomit
But I can promise you one thing, I walk it like I talk it
If I shoot a comet at you better hope that you can duck it
Fuck it, I'm annoyed with some of these shitty rappers
Tryin to turn the fuckin lights out just call me The Clapper
Cause homeboy is a poser, takin it so far
I put you on the corner where most of my hoes are, and

[Chorus 2X: B-Real]
You can make money for daddy, just don't be mad at me
But this is what happens any time you throw a jab at me
You can take a stab at me, and really get peeled maybe
It's time to put you away, homey I'm still crazy

[Jaysaun]
Lord forgive me I'm surrounded by sin, insects crawlin under my skin
Demons knockin at the door of my mind, I feel like lettin 'em in
What you call drug dependency
I call settin a trend
I was always into drugs, just nobody caught me
I learned it from the best teachers, my family taught me
I got knocked went to trial, guess what that bought me?
The aura of invincibility, you can't stop me
My great grandfather was a doctor, his son was a doctor
Soon as I found pussy, I wanted to play doctor~!
In my middle school locker I had a bottle of vodka
Took a shot at lunchtime, sprayed my breath with Binaca
I'm no psycho, my sheet says I'm a sociopath
I enjoy prescription pills and blowin that grass
What you callin big cash, I would throw in the stash
That weed you saying's exotic I throw in the trash

[Chorus 2X: Jaysaun]
I got nothin to live for except a 40 cal slug
Waitin up in the barrel I can take it in the mug
Everybody hates Jay, that don't faze me
I never learned karate, but I know crazy</pre>
