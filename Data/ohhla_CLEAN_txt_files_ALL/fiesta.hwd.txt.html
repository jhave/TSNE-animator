[Mase]
All Out, we don't stop, we don't don't stop
All Out, we don't stop, we don't don't stop
All Out, make it hot, don't stop, c'mon
C'mon, Harlem World make it hot, don't stop c'mon
All Out, All Out

[Stase]
Yo, yo, I'm the perfect example of a chick that's classy
Flashy, sassy, papparazzi don't harrass me 
Move too swift for y'all chicks to pass me
Anything y'all wanna know, come ask me
How come when I'm in the street or a open place
Everybody scopin' Stase like I got a open case 
Anything you gotta say to me
You can say to me, it's Baby Stase
The more I make, the more they hate 
See, I might as well admit it, everybody wanna hit it
Cuz I got a clean record not to mean you see me naked, check it
I don't know what's wrong with these cats
It's 'bout to be a setback in this game called rap, see
I was once told, Harlem World don't fold
We 'bout to drop a flow the world can hold
Seem like while I'm seeing Platinum, everybody sayin' Gold
The world really see what happens when my click unfold

[Mase]
1 - 	We're going to party, fiesta (All Out)
	And stay fly, foreva
	C'mon, c'mon Harlem World
	Can't go wrong

	We're going to party, fiesta (All Out)
	And stay fly, foreva
	C'mon, c'mon Harlem World
	Can't go wrong

[Blinky Blink]
Yo, Harlem World is who I'm runnin wit (yeah, honeys wit' it)
See the size of my money clip? (Now, I'm on the funny tip)
I know you hate me, hate Mase, cuz you make papes
And got girls in like 48 states (48 states)
But kickin' the women who wear the straight face
While y'all cats wild out and 'bout to get a rape case
But why player hate?  Cuz I sex girls and they say I'm great
You bust one tank, can't even stay awake
Not now, we gon' talk on a later day
What you think?  You can hold Blink?  Uh uh
I got a gold link with more ice than cold drinks
So, playa get to that, and keep your chick in tact
She says your sex was whack, cuz I'd twist her back
And everytime I kick my rap, man I stick to facts (All Out)
But when my trees wasn't sellin'
I switch to Jack
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Repeat 1

[Huddy Combs]
Yo, yo, yo, I need a wifee, chipped up lightly
You stay in the thong, I'mma stay where the ice be
Indian givin', got Caribbean women
Willin' to have everything like me and my children (All Out)
So, dear, front of the billin'
Hundreds in the ceiling, tank tops in the drop 
Cuz I'm one of them villain
Cook for me, come open a book for me
Shook the key, your whole look hooked me
With her legs tied up, eggs sunny side up
No cash in the stash get that money right up (c'mon, c'mon)
See, all girls love me, can't get nothing from me
I stay in the Mall, spendin' rich chicks' money
Tricked on her friend so her friend wanna fuck me
That one named Huddy, W dot Huddy, W dot Huddy
W dot Huddy, W dot Huddy, W dot Huddy
