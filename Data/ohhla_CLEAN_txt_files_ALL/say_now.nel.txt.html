[Nelly]
Gun shots ringed out over the city
And had everybody duckin and runnin checkin for any
Kinda shelter cause them peoples man they at it again
If you aint heard or seen it then you better pretend
Aint got no time for stoppin aint no catchin your wind
Ya baby mammas on the porch tellin her daughters "come in" 
Got fathers grabbin sons "where the hell have you been?"
Boy and y'all just startin young I'm talkin 13 and 10 
They started tradin in the streets some type of ghetto battles
But they aint hoopin in the gym they hoopin crates in the alleys
Where else can you shoot a jump shot 
Slang a rock all from the same spot?
Got one gang on this half the other gang
on the other half of the same block
Gunplay on Monday 
Sundays a fun day
Will it stop one day? 
I cant call it no way 
When your gettin started everybody wanna help and get you off
But turn around first motherfuckers wanna see you fall 

[Chorus]
Say now (say now)
Can you hoes come out to play now? (play now) 
Say now (say now)
Can you hoes come out to play now? (play now)
Say now (na na na na) 
Can you hoes come out to play now? (na na na na na na na na)
Say now (na na na na) 
Can you hoes come out
Na wait a minute na wait a minute na wait a minute na 

[Hook: 2x]
Feel like I'm runnin for the daylight
Tryin ta get my mind right
And just before I die will somebody reach out and snatch it from me 
Say now 
Can you hoes come out to play now? 

[Nelly]
(Hear me out)
Tryin ta put my city on the map and they mad at me 
The same city some of them live in and they mad at me 
When I come down to speak dirty why you mad at me? 
Is it cause the old school freaked out niggas from A to Z?
Eight cd's,tv's, I aim to please 
They mean the same to me like Biggie to C's 
Like Easy to E's, Tupac to overseas 
And I done seen more Lia fans fall cry to their knees 
I tell ya, I aint been livin this life for too long 
And I cant count how many times someone has asked me what's wrong
Why my mother was gone
Why my dady wasnt home 
And the same shit they told me I found myself tellin my own 
Now its good-bye bad nights 
Hello good times 
There aint no way Ill let no nigga step in my shine
Keep tryin (keep tryin) 
Theres bound ta be somethin G
As long as I'm in STL  
You in the TIC
I'll tell ya

[Chorus]

[Hook]
