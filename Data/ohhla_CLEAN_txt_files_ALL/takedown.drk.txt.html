[Intro]
[Drake Talking/ad-libing]
Its Young Money Baby
I got something for these niggas to ride to
Fa'sho
Here I go

[Verse 1]
Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now,
Su-woop to the bangers,
Su-woop to the bangers, (yeah)
And I say, I be on some G shit
I be on some G shit
Check out what I done, and
Check out who I be with
I'm me bitch, I said I'm me bitch

Then it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

[Guitar Break]

[Verse 2]
Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love,
Cuz I don't have the time for that
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where its at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract

I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggaz for that louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch

And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

[Guitar Break/Breakdown/Solo]

[Outro Verse]
I ain't have sex in a long time [x3]
Are we havin is sex tonight?
Ladies say, I ain't have sex in a long time
I ain't have sex in a long ass time
Baby, I ain't have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight, sex tonight

Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now
Su-woop to the (whoa oh oh ohh)</pre>
