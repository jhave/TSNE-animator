[Savage On The Beat]

Devils [x3] {Yeaaaaaaa}
We Talkin' Bout Devils [x4]

[Verse 1]
Mane it's Payback
For All Da Months Dat I Layed Back
For All Da Blunts Dat Had Me Lazy And Crazy
It's Drama Time {Time}
I'm Gettin' Ten For A Show {Let's Go}
Album Ain't Even Dropped
When it's Dropped I'm Gettin' Mo
Wish I Can Go Down Every Street {Every Street}
But Da Fuckin' Narcotics Say I Got Death On Me
Niggas They Try To Rebel Me {Shiid}
But it's Motivation
I'm a Keep Gettin' Money
Gon' Soulja Hate Me
Da Judge Looked At Me
And Said How You Doin' Boosie
He Called Me By My Nickname {Ooooh}
What You Think I'm Stupid {Bitch}
You Wanna Railroad A Nigga {Believe Dat}
And Lose Me In The System
But Like C-Murder And Mack
I Refuse To Be A Victim Nigga

[Chorus]
Devils Get Up Off Me [x8]

[Verse 2]
Look, Look
See Where I'm From Nigga it's Do Or Die {Die}
Nigga Tell You He Gone Kill You
You Gone Shoot Or Die
Dem Devils Got Dem Youngters Wildin' Out At Twelve Nah {Twelve Nah}
And Hollin' Mutha Fuck Jail Dey Goin' To Hell Nah {Fuck Hell}
See I'm From Baton Rouge
Better Known As Rattin' Rouge {Rattin' Rouge}
Da Police Know Yo Ass Dirty 'Fore You Even Do It
I'm So Gutta, So Gangsta, So In Da Streets {What Else?}
I'm So Freaky, So Nasty, So In Da Sheets {Believe Dat}
My Cousin Life, Da Grandpa Wife
And Niggas Mad? {Fuck}
Da Judge Ain't Nothin' But The Devil
Him And The Jury
I Seen A Nigga Die In Front Of Me
Eyes Rolled Back
They Threw Da Choppa
Like Hold Dat

[Chorus]
Devils Get Up Off Me [x8]

[Verse 3]
Can't Even Ride And Get High
Cause Them Devils Out
They Catch Me On A Back Street
They Gone Knock Me Off
Yea I'm Talkin' Bout The Law
Ya'll Sum Fuckin' Devils
Up In School You Got Blues
Now Ya Bout Wateva
Hoes Tryna Get Money
Tryna Sell Dat Cat
Devil Get Yo Ass Away
Iont Pay For Dat
Don't He Get Ya At The Wrong Place
At The Wrong Time
Now You Gone For A Very Long Time {Damn}
You Hit The Pin
And You Heard Tha Fuckin' Door Slam
He Was Ya Shoes, Ya Zoos, And Ya Wam Wam
He Was With You In Them Times When You Ain't Give A Damn
He Was That Liquor In Ya Hand
Sayin' Kill Me Man

But He Ain't Ready To Go To War
