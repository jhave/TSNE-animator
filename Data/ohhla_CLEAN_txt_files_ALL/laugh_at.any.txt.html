[Verse 1]
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
High school reunion wouldn't show my face
I was always looked at a little different
And I got blamed for everything even if I ain't do the shit
It was hectic, a total fuckin' nightmare
A room full of preps and one thug with braided hair
Runnin' through the halls screamin' "Fuck all y'all!"
Brass knuckle punch jackin' all jock's jaws
Insane in the cranium, people always starin'
Pointin' at me, laughin' close enough so I can hear em
Until the day that I got my revenge
When they found one student stabbed to death with a pen
Whole school goin' through some emotional stress
Gotta half day off cause of that bullshit
Let me take another victim, see if I can get a whole day
Remember that bitch Lisa, they just found her in the hallway
I ain't playin' no more, stop laughin'
Cause all that chit-chattin' has got this killa crackin'
Teacher's pet, bullet hole in ya chest
Whole football team damn near layed to rest
Half the students missin', and no one knows shit
They haven't got a clue that it was all me bitch
Higher education learn a little somethin' ya self
Who's next to be got, not too many left
I'm so glad this year's almost over
And maybe next year before they laugh, they'll look over their shoulder
New students comin' in and I'mma still be in the same grade
Murder after murder all the way until I graduate
Crazy killa, crazy killa's what they call me
No evidence, but I'm still the number one suspect
Never once was invited to a party
And if I ever was, all I'd do is bring bloodshed

[Hook] -x2
They don't like me
They don't want me
Ever since I got here
They treated me strange
They got me goin' crazy
Ain't nobody feelin' my pain

[Break]
I will shed no more tears
So many years, my head's been clear
But now I understand
To make all those around me fear

[Repeat until end]
They're all gonna laugh at you!</pre>
