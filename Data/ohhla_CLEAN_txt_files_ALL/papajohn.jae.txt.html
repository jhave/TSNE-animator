Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
8 slices, hundred 25 a piece
Playing with a little dope, I'm about my chicks
Source unknown but I got those
Hot and ready, shout out to my vados
Place your order and it won't be long
Out the brick over right into your home
It's time to eat, ding dong
Powder, I got them packs, Papa John

[Verse 1]
Millz ain't on his shit? Nah, you got it wrong
You can't name a corner I ain't poppin on
Double park, make sure my money right then I be gone
He's on the phone with a bitch that get that sloppy one
Yea her ass mean but her mouth meaner
Spanish bitch, I make her pussy sing like Selena
My flow hard but I could get it soft
Grew up round that Snow White bitch, ain't seen no seven dwarves
Fuck my money up and it's vamanos
Infrared, that your crew, now you're Domino's
Your girl on my dick cause you a fuckin clown
Treat her pussy like my work, get it home and bust it down
Down down, Papa John
Call me Papa John
If he a loyal customer that's extra toppings for him

[Bridge]
But ain't no coming down on my price though
Yea we cool and all that but that's my price dog

[Chorus]
8 slices, hundred 25 a piece
Playing with a little dope, I'm about my chicks
Source unknown but I got those
Hot and ready, shout out to my vados
Place your order and it won't be long
Out the brick over right into your home
It's time to eat, ding dong
Powder, I got them packs, Papa John

[Verse 2]
I'm a uptown nigga to the death
You play the stupid, make em form a line to the left
All the fiends know who got that killa nigga
We got the hood lookin like thrilla nigga
I like my women vintage in muskino
Ladylike but still swallow kids like pinot
Bitch I'm bout multiplyin paper, kinko
Sippin Rose out the bottle, with a straw like I'm Nino
Papi call me mi amigo
But mami call me papi lindo
She understand her role is a deliver missile
I cook it then I shoot her off to get it to you
Yea in high-school we had it locked down
And yet you bug with your homeboy from out of town

[Chorus]
8 slices, hundred 25 a piece
Playing with a little dope, I'm about my chicks
Source unknown but I got those
Hot and ready, shout out to my vados
Place your order and it won't be long
Out the brick over right into your home
It's time to eat, ding dong
Powder, I got them packs, Papa John</pre>
