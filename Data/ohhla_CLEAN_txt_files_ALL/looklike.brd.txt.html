Looks like a looks like a job job job for job for

[Baby in the backround of chorus]
Oh yeah!

Birdman motherfucker, holla at your boy nigga
Look, whew, fly in any weather nigga
Tryin to get this money
You know real real high, real real high
We tryin to stack it biatch
Bird call motherfucker!

[Chorus]
Birdman, look looks like a looks like a looks like a job job job for job for
Birdman, look looks like a looks like a looks like a job job job for job for
Birdman, look looks like a looks like a looks like a job job job for job for
Birdman, look looks like a looks like a looks like a job job job for job for

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm on a mission lil daddy to scoop in the Caddy go visit Ms. Gladius
B(ah) to A(ah) to B-Y BIATCH!
Somethin' so fly and somethin' so slick
24's, 28's, got to be better, 18's never, nigga whatever
It's the New Orleans finest BIATCH!
I'm a worldwide rider with that Gucci and Prada shit
Look like I got to uplift my Prada, get a few dollars, holla at a model
Nigga if it ain't money it can't beat me
That platinum from the neck, wrists, finger, and teeth
But I'm so so cool and I'm so so ooh
Get outta line watch me bust my 2
I ran out the house and I ran in the building
Them people was comin, "Hands up!" ya feel me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I'm the bird of the nest
The shark of the sea
Hungry dog on the concrete that's tryin' to eat
Nobody move me cause I be who I be
The Uptown rider, the home CMB
I get what I want when I want I could have it
Lexus, Bentley, and the Jag nothin' average
Never got married but I'm lovin' Ms. Gladius
Birdlady in that brand new Caddy
I'm a boss nigga
Nothin' less, two boats no cost nigga
Fly nigga hold your hearts nigga
That what Daddy told you, Mommy told you
I stand my grounds, be a man homie
No quarters no halves, with them wholes thang
"Fuck it, pitch in nigga!" and don't fuck with them chickens man
Flip whatever: cars, rims, and bucks
Live this life like you don't give a fuck nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Do a doughnut, swing around, and come around the corner
Change feathers twice, come back with the homies
That fly shit, that Prada and Gucci sheets
Feather to the floor with swine on her feets
Bezel that glow with the 9 on the seats
And whether thats snow or white mink on me
See I'm hustlin' leathers and I'm chasin' cheddars 
That's Eminem's bitch, it gets no better
With the wide D-lips with the custom leather
And I ball like a dawg Hood Rich forever
See I'm iced all up with that chrome metal
Fully equiped with the Coogi sweater
But it's the Birdman daddy, I run with the bird game
Birds got to have it with my birdy change
But it's the big thangs on the big Range, stop and goes
26's, 28's, it's the Birdman

[Chorus 3X]

[Baby in the backround of chorus]
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah, you understand?
Birdman baby
Oh yeah, you're becoming my kind of a bird
You understand nigga?
Flip one, sell one, roll one baby
Whatever nigga, however you gonna go we gunna roll it to you bitch
I'm comin' to your hood boy, I'm flyin' too
18's is better, never nigga, 24's, 28's, I'm singing nigga
You understand this biatch?
Get rid of it little daddy
You understand?
Birdman motherfucker!
You know, you gots to hate me nigga
Bird call bitch
Let's get this money, holla at your boy nigga!
The Stunna, Cash Money number one nigga!
Yeah, that's how you lace me nigga!
I'm lovin' it!
Hey Lil' Weezy, Papa doin' his thang nigga!
Later boy, BMJ out!
Let's get this money baby
