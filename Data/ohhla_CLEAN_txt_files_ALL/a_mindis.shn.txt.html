Song:   A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

Gangs usually roll as a savage pack
Once sworn in, there's no turnin back
Initiation, manhoods are tested
Do crime, you'll fail by becoming arrested
Get beat down the line, cautiously steppin
Always watchin your back with your hand on your weapon
You blink for a minute and get brutally beaten
Every time you diss the colors it will keep on repeatin
When you say you knew somebody that was a gang member
You can't say you know him, you can only remember
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you wanna be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste

Just a walk on the block, they tell you it costs
Willingly pay - or be forced
Once your color is set you gotta be stern
A bad influence for the young that are eager to learn
The rules of a gang is fightin and killin
Did you ever stop to think that was blood you were spillin?
Duckin from the cops most the time
Because you live life devoted to crime
Gangs are mainly based on colors and races
Not everywhere, just in particular places
Hang on the corner or on the stoop
Fightin people lookin just like a terrorist group
Gangs give a rank at society level
Wear a tatoo skull with the mark of the devil
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you wanna be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste

No turnin back [repeated]

Had many bad dreams, nights stayin awake
Joinin a gang was the fatal mistake
Just to fill your head with knowledge till your mind goes blank
And rumble with boys and dispose of the shank
GANG can be spelled with capital letters
Yo, while you're sweepin the streets, does it make you feel better?
Some gangs lack action, they're basically talk
Until their brains get scattered on the sidewalk
Your obligation is to serve as a marionette
And by society you're treated like a homeless pet
You wanna live the life of crime doin negative things
When Al Capone died, so did gangster kings
To live the life of a gangster is all out of place
Because a mind is a terrible thing to waste

Gangs are always violent but jail is rough
You go a man and you may leave a cream puff
You say you do crime cause you're poverty stricken
And so is everybody that you're robbin and vickin
Gangs ain't gonna be around much longer
If 5 out of 10 become mentally stronger
My mother said bein in a gang ain't nothin
I didn't listen to her cause I thought she was bluffin
I thank her from my heart that she stayed on my case
Made sure my mind didn't just become another waste
