Huh...
You lil boyz don't know what it mean ta get shot
You lil boyz don't wanna do nothin' but hang on tha block
Yoy lil boyz ain't ready to go to tha pen
You lil boyz ain't ready to be sleepin' with nothin' but men
You lil boyz better stay in your place
You lil boyz ain't gon' be scared until you catch you a case
You lil boyz be out here sniffin' that furl
You lil boyz gotta get loaded just to go in that world
You lil boyz had better hit you a lick
You lil boyz shouldn't have ta ask another nigga for shit
You lil boyz don't even respect your momma
You lil boyz don't even have tha sense to be a Big Tymer
You lil boyz swear to God it's a game
You lil boyz gotta kill somethin' and get you a name
You lil boyz always be makin' a scene
You lil boyz wanna be grown, and you're still in your teens

(chorus [Lil' Wayne])
Look, you lil boyz better slow down
Up in tha mornin', in tha court, it's 'bout to go down
Here come them niggas: soulja, Reebok, and Girbaud down
There's no remorse now
'Bout to explode rounds
Look, you lil boyz better ta slow down
Up in tha mornin', in tha court, it's 'bout to go down
Here come them niggas: soulja, Reebok, and Girbaud down
There's no remorse now
'Bout to explode rounds

[Baby]
You lil boyz better clear tha block
'Cause somebody done ran in my money spot
Cock tha glocks, we prepared to pop
Can't let it slide 'cause these lil boyz ain't right
Somebody gon' die tonight when we ride tonight
I'ma clear your set if I heard your name up in my mess
Best make a set trap, bust back with booby traps
You're outta line if you're playin' with mine
Fuck these bezzel bitch niggas gon' meet tha devil
Lil boyz don't know they playin' with rainy weather
Fuckin' with my cheddar
B.G., Wayne, Juvie, Big Tymers, whatever
But, however, if I could do
I'ma cook your hood like I cook up pill-goods, fool

(chorus [Lil' Wayne])
You lil boyz better ta slow down
Up in tha mornin', in tha court, it's 'bout ta go down
Here come them niggas: soulja, Reebok, and Girbaud down
There's no remorse now
'Bout to explode rounds
Look, you lil boyz need ta slow down
Up in tha mornin', in tha cut, it's 'bout ta go down
Here come them niggas: soulja, Reebok, and Girbaud down
There's no remorse now
'Bout to explode rounds
Look

[Mannie Fresh]
Check it out, check it out
You lil boyz make it happen, pack up y'all shit
You lil boyz need to go ahead on and quit, see
You lil boyz know y'all time is up
You lil boyz need to (gimme gimme gimme) get tha fuck
You lil boyz kinda like had '99
But look, you lil boyz from today to lights out, it's mine
You lil boyz need ta (???) with y'all's friends
You lil boyz really women with paws like mens
You lil boyz stay out mine and worry 'bout yurn
You lil boyz is tha right hook for this song 'cause y'all children
You lil boyz need to stop stealin' my beats
You lil boyz think a producer won't take y'all off y'all feets
You lil boyz know I do beats for twenty
You lil boyz add that up: zero zero zero comma, aw, fuck it, it's plenty
You lil boyz tell y'all baby-momma I'm back in town
You lil boyz smiles done turned into frowns

[Lil' Wayne]
Look, look,
When.. I.. ride.. dog
Chopper.. be on.. my.. side.. dog
Niggas betta run.. duck.. hide.. dog
'Cause I'm about to let.. bullets.. fly.. dog
Bahdi-by-by
Get it.. right, nigga

Duct tape your momma, and shoot off in your.. wife, nigga
Look, ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
Keep sprayin'.. tha MAC-11.. burst
Hit 'em where it.. hurts

Blood all over tha place
Hit tha block, have thugs all over tha place
It's Lil' Wayne, nigga, whoa now
If you don't think you can hang, nigga, slow down

(Chorus [Lil' Wayne])
Look, look,
'Cause you lil boyz need ta slow down
Up in tha mornin', in tha court, it's 'bout ta go down
Here come them niggas: soulja, Reebok, and Girbaud down
There's no remorse now
'Bout to explode rounds
Look, you lil boyz need ta slow down
Up in tha mornin', in tha court, it's 'bout ta go down
Here come them niggas: soulja, Reebok, and Girbaud down
There's no remorse now
'Bout to explode rounds

[Lil' Wayne]

Up in tha mornin', in tha court, it's 'bout ta go down
