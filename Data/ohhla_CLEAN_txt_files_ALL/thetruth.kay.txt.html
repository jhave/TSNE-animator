Uhh.. yeah..
See, this is what these mixtapes is all about..
Knah'msayin KaySlay?
Talk to the people, with no interruptions and interference..

Put that mic down, admire the technique and tight tight sounds
of a +Renagade+, never been afraid, the time is right now
Before I take my bow and finally allow
my love affair with rap to fade, I'll sink into the page
Pleasur and the pain that came from rulin the game
And the half Dominican that gave me brains in the fast lane
A seventeen-year reign, simple and plain
When I ruled the rap game and all my peers sold cocaine
One-three-two Uptown, when Rich Porter told me
"See you can push a new car, it's different for a rap star"
And AZ was givin 50s to the homeless
They never bragged about it  "L, we don't condone this"
On the back of the bike with Alpo
Doin a buck down one-two-five, hopin to stay alive
Favorite spot rooftop
Me and Big chuckle up when he was hittin up "Juicy" and whatnot
Damn, when Dapper Dan got shot up
Before they made drops when we had to cut the top up
Some cats neglected the fact that L was hot
Cause they warm and electin me hot when I stepped in the spot
Lyrically reppin the block on Farmers to rock
But my sex symbol status made me, corny to cop
The microphone strategist ripped the apparatus
Left competition embarrassed but I never held malice
Kinda saw street literature
Used to lose battles on purpose so these cats can dream more
I wanna see y'all shine without the use of a nine
You might see a nigga, I see a black Einstein
A diamond in the rough, he's remidin me as tough
Young girls takin X, she's blinded by the stuff
Oh my God, where did we go wrong?
Are you doin what you're doin cause I ruined you with songs?
God forgive me, I never knew my power to devour the demons
Y'all know the Devil be schemin
It's a manifestation of the pain of a nation
that makes materialism the only thing we're chasin
The real gangstas never talked to me tough
Never told me they was hard, or claimed to be my God
When I first found the courage to bounce up outta Queens
And saw Big Dave comin up out the store with money machines
My only dream was to rock mics in the spotlight
Joint bumpin on Marley Show all night
Whoever thought that I would be a movie star?
A rap icon, chokin the game like a python
Russell turned the hype on, exploded like a pipe bomb {*explosion*}
Just because a young boy, turned the mic on
Still admire skills and cats that are ill
with lyri-kills, nowadays the chorus is payin the bill
The black man found a way outta the hood
Now it's slaves to {*edit*} mayor's not all good
Don't let 'em take our music and plagiarize the game
Then you call up and request it and pretend it's really flames?
The tip of the iceberg, I'll hold my piece
In the meantime, live smart, watch out for the beast
Lyrical Picasso flow masterpiece
Like Michaelangelo or Rembrant, you know?
Si palare poco Italiano
LL bravisimo, grazie, prego!
Más mejor siempre mi amigo
Pero, music is muy muy duro
Tú sabe, que tú quieres es no problema
Te quiero mucho, yo comprendo your dilemma
Summer's comin, it won't always be winter
I pray to God He forgives me, I'm a sinner

That's a little message..
All the brothers and sisters out there..
Y'all be strong..
Keep your dreams flowin baby..
KaySlay I'm out for presidents to represent me..
But I wanna get 'em the right way, y'know? {*echoes*}</pre>
