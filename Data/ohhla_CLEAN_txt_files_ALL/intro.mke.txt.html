Jeaaa! The wait is over baby
Who is Mike Jones?, First Album
I put two million on that ass baby
I brought double platinum plaque back to the H
But politics and bullshit kept me away from y'all
Kept me away from the game, but now I'm back
And now y'all able to here the voice of who?
Mike Jones! Hit me up 2812063446 baby
Be on the look out for my next album: Expect the Unexpected baby
You never know what to expect from Mike Jones baby
I hear you boys out there hatin, talking down, sneak dissin
But guess what? I got my swagger right</pre>
