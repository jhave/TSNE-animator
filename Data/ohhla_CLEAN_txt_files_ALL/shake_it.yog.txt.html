[Verse 1]
Down here Memphis no hanky panky
And we ride whips on twanky twanky's
Thugged out club scene dranky dranky
That cristy cristy til' we faint'n faint'n
Aaaaayyyyyyy!
And they run to the dance floor
All shape sizes from dime to zero
I'm not Captain Kurt or Captain Nero
I'm just trying to get you and your friend to G-O
Then I dream voices hit my ski-lo
T-shirt, head band, tech-marino
Old school throw back Memphis sho-bo
Lorenzo jersey to hide the 4-O
Shawty, Cree-o and she know Judo
She say she got some green that will send me to Pluto
Sorry mommy ya boy don't smizzo
But you can let your boy burn brain in the G-4

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Aaaaaaayyyyyyyyy!
Shake it mommy
Girl tell me where you get that from
Put it on me
Alright (alright)

[verse 2]
I'm like me burning drink but me at the bar and uuhhh...
Me from the hood but me is a star and uuhhh...
You looking right and we can go far if uuhhh...
Ya don't mind spending time with a hustlah
Yo gotti, M down, Lil' Monster and
You get it right how bout you be his wifey and
We cock whips move bricks in a mini van
Take trips to Hawaii to hula dance
Aaaaayyyyyyy!
She back in Philippines
Aaaaayyyyyyy!
Looking right in them Gucci jeans
She bounce she turn she drop it low
And I look like damn! This bitch is cold
The monastery monora whatever hoe
Look I'm from Memphis ain't seen that shit before
Down here they twerk and shake it fast
But we love it cuz we watch  her crip her ass

[Chorus]</pre>
