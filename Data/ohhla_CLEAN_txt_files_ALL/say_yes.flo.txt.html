[Verse 1]
Just tell him
See I been watching you for a while
Your smile and stuff
But I don't know if I can
Be with you for the night
Is that all right, Is that all right... baby... baby

[Verse 2]
There is only one for me
You have made that possibility
We can take that step to see
If this is really gonna be
All you gotta do is say yes

[Chorus]
All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel
Let me undress you baby
Open up your mind just rest
I'm about to let you know
You make me so

All you gotta do is say yes 
Don't deny what you feel
Let me undress you baby
Open up your mind just rest
I'm about to let you know
You make me so so so so so so so so
You make me so so so so so so so so aahh

[Verse 3]
Loving you has taken time, taken time
But I always knew you could be mine
I recognise the butterflies, inside me, Uh
Since it's gonna be made tonight, tonight
All you gotta do is say yes

[Chorus]
All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel
Let me undress you baby
Open up your mind just rest
I'm about to let you know
You make me so

Oh ah oh ah oh ah
Don't deny what you feel
Let me undress you baby
Open up your mind and just rest
I'm about to let you know

You make me so so so so so so so so
You make me so so so so so so so so
You make me so so so so so so so so
You make me so so so so so so so so so so
 
Ah ah ah ah uh uh uh oh oh oh oh mmmmm
Ah ah ah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh right there
Right there right there right there right there
Ah ah oh oh mmm m m m m mmmmmmmm
All you gotta do

All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel
Let me undress you baby</pre>
