Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Talking]
Za, you movin' to L.A
Shoutout my brother Tyga
Shoutout my nigga Trel
Shoutout my nigga YG

[Lil Twist]
I'm gettin' crazy, it's Lil Twiszzy baby
Rollin with my team, stay strapped like the Navy
Daddy told me never let a nigga play me
Now if you try off his ass there's no if's, and's, or maybe's
And before they locked him up, he left a '81 Mercedes
Swear to God this shit sittin' on a hunnid spoke daily
Youngin' told me roll careful 'cause the nigga still hate
But I just use it for the goods
Rollin, pullin' old ladies
Straight jammin' Golden Child, middle finger out the window
Went to Drake and reppin' YOLO maybe you ain't get the memo
I'm doing drugs like the 80's, animated like Nintendo
Still rich but on my bummy swag, [?]
I'm a mothafuckin' beast and I ain't even say the least
Throw yo momma from the train like you D-D-Danny Devito
B-B-Best youngin' out, what is do you want from me ho?
If you want me for a show, it's 20 racks, no I ain't cheap ho
But they know I get em crazy
It's Lil Twiszzy baby
But when I'm with my team, you know we strapped like the Navy
So when they want me at they sweet 16
Best believe we got that M16
Nah mean? Cause..

I'm getting crazy, Lil Twizzy bitch
Rollin' with my team, stay strapped like the Navy
Mama told me never let a bitch play me

We getting crazy
Lil Twizzy baby
Young Money bitch, don't shit phase me
You say 50 racks can't phase you
It's Young Money, Cash Money, shit me too
Or either, kick back with Bieber
And if you don't know me, just refer me as Young [?]
And I don't give you three strikes homie, no Adidas
I signed with ConVerse, bigga checks come first
B-Bout to be as big as Biggie when I emerge
And buy a set of twin Glocks, like Pac in bun first
[?] killuminati all over ya body, and I just told Za to get a 12 gauge shawty
Cause Uhhhh..

I'm getting crazy, Lil Twizzy bitch
Rollin' with my team, stay strapped like the Navy
Mama told me never let a bitch play me
Uh
I'm getting crazy, it's Lil Twizzy baby
Rollin' with my team, stay strapped like the Navy
Daddy told me never let a nigga play me
Now if you try off his ass there's no if's, and's or maybe's</pre>
