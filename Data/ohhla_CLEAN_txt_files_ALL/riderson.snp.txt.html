Hey yo Jim man why don't ya, you don't you kick some of that
You know, you know how you do it man
It's a trip people don't even believe were together right now (wow) but tell
your story you know the one I like say it for me (Ride, ride, ride)

Riders on the storm (Ride, ride, ride)
Riders on the storm (Ride, ride, ride)
Into this house we're born (Into this house we're born)
Into this world we're thrown (Into this world we're thrown)
Like a dog without a bone (Like a dog without a bone)
An actor out on loan (An actor out on loan)
Riders on the storm (Ride, ride, ride)

There's a killer on the road (Killer, Murder)
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday (holidays, holidays)
Let your children play (play)
If ya give this man a ride
Sweet memory will die (Die)
Killer on the road, yeah (Killer, Murder)

[Snoop]
Goin' off of this off of that with the Lizard king
Bumpin' in the back (wow) how bout that (yeah)
Driftin', Liftin', Swiftin', coastin', testaroastin'
But the wheels won't stop 200 (errrr) on the highway fresh
Up off the block he's a rider, na he's a killer dresses in all black
But his hat says stealla (stealla)
Petal to the metal I gotta go hard
Drive by and say hello hey Fredwreck you my mello now let me

gas cause I just to clean I do it upper class so fasten your seat
belts its so hot it will even make heat melt (woo, woo) so get a bowl
and roll and ride slip through the slip and slide

Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If ya give this man a ride
Sweet memory will die
Killer on the road, yeah
