Song:   mirror in the Sky
Typed by: sim006@gmail.com

[Chorus 2X]
Dressed up and nowhere to go, I
Am looking the mirror in the sky
Make me row my boat
Out to the sea but they knocking on my door again

[Verse 1]
If I told you you wouldn't believe it
Tonight there's a roaring storm
Took some time for my eyes to reveal it
Now it seems that it won't go on
When I wake and I go to my closet
Find something fresh to wear
Hoping I open up the door now
Seems that the cupboard is bare
It's the same old soul, the same old song
The same old role
It's the same old soul, the same old song
The same old wrong
Now I'm taking time down the roadblocks
I can't stop no, no, the same old song

[Chorus 2X]
Dressed up and nowhere to go, I
Am looking for the mirror in the sky
Make me row my boat
Out to the sea but they knocking on my door again

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm not a gangster, I'm not a beggar
I'm not a, I'm not a pimp, I'm not a prankster
I'm not an actor, not a fighter
I'm a just a man that makes the crowd push up your lighter
Been chopping down blocks
Things never stop (same old soul)
Tica tica tock and say (same old song)
Oh, the day we gon' lie (same old soul)
Listen to the radio, just fly (same old song)

[Bridge 2X]
Freeze the frame
What's her name?
Play the game
But got no fame

[Chorus 2X]
I'm all dressed up this evening
With no real place to go
With all these human beings
Putting on a show</pre>
