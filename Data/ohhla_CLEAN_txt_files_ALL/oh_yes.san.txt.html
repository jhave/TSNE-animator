[Intro]
Okay (get up, get up)
DipSet (uh oh)
Juelz Santana
Heatmakerz (clap)
I think this the one right here (everybody, come on, get up)
Huh, he's moving again

[Juelz Santana]
I'm like (oh yes)
I'm nice (oh yes)
Still pitching (weight)
Still flipping (weight), yeah
So come fuck with the boy
I'm still pumping the boy
I'll still dump on the boy
Blue steel pump to the boy
I'm Mr. Postman, also Mr. Toastman
I'm yelling (wait), yeah I'm selling (weight), hey
I keep my chick on smash like a muhfucker
Thick lips, hips, tits, ass like a muhfucker
I get big chips, cash like a muhfucker
I don't (wait), nope, I won't (wait), yeah
I explore and cruise
Islands and shores that's new
Bring the boat out, smoke out
Watch the water move
I'm a water dude, jet skis, water pools
Surfing the (wave), I'm hurting the (wave)
Like, Cowabunga, dude
This forty cali-caliber cowabunga you
Bump you like how a bumper do
I'm on the corner, pumping like how a pumper do
What, that (weight), yup, that (weight)

[Chorus]
AY (oh yes) AY (oh yes) SAY (oh yes, wait a minute mister mister mi-mi-mi)
This the jam, yep
Put your hands up
And just (wave)
And just (wave)
AY (oh yes) AY (oh yes) SAY (oh yes, wait a minute mister mister mi-mi-mi)

I'm Mr. Postman, also Mr. Toastman
Oh man (wait), oh man (wait)
I'm Mr. Postman, also Mr. Toastman
Oh man (I'm back), oh man (I'm back)

[Juelz Santana]
I'm back
I'm crack
Sorry about the (wait)
Sorry I made you (wait)
I can't let my peeps down, I can't let my seed down
They need me out there (yeah)
I can't let the streets down
I gotta do it B I, G now, I see now
I couldn't (wait), nope, I couldn't (wait) AY
Plus the ladies love the kid
Plus the babies love the kid
Could it be I'm from the eighties
They know what I'm up against
Call me a grinder, call me a survivor
Why should I (wait), how could I (wait), no
Plus I'm a sex symbol (symbol)
That'll make your bitch bed tremble
Floor shake, bar rock, hard cock (cock)
Hit it left once, right twice, work the middle
Stoke her, then I smoke her

[Chorus] - repeat to fade</pre>
