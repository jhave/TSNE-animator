[Chorus: Saudia Mills]
Do you feel the wind, this time?
Do you see the moonlight shine?
Cause the twilight, seems near
But the light shines, nowhere
Do you feel the cold, winds blow?
Do you see the darkening glow?
Cause the twilight, seems near
But the light shines, nowhere

[Ghostface Killah]
She was amazing, Carmela, caramel complexion
Think God brought her into my life, as a suggestion
We clicked, I liked mink, she liked iced out rings
The finer things in life, together we share drinks
Vodka and cranberry, my little cherry if I got locked
She would fill up my commissary
It was natural, I felt the bond between us
She was the jelly to my peanuts, Mars to Venus
The Earth to my Sun, Moon and Stars, we added up, mathematically
It's like I had a bad habit, B
She knew my lifestyle, chick of a crime boss
She would hide my guns in my house then, lie to the task force
Finish my sentence, knew my exact frame of mind
Knew everything I had was hers, and she was mine
We were crazy in love, couldn't get enough of each other
The center of attraction, we were made for one another

[Cappadonna]
Nah, don't even fall for that Caucasoid
She got the drink laced, trynna turn you to an android
She not your peanut butter, more like a fucking nutcase
You all google-eyed, DeLuca's mob watching your place
They pulling trains on her, beat and rape, cum in her face
They got the drop on you, son, you a fucking disgrace
You think God sent her? Nah, it's the Devil instead
They got plans for you, Tone, they want you dead, dead, dead
So get rid of that cherry, papa, she plan poison
So plot on that hoe, they bout to bring the poison
Yeah, dun-dun, DeLuca's mob, want your head on the platter
It don't matter, son, all your dreams is gonna shatter
They trynna get atcha, she got you caught in the rapture
Nigga, wake up, ya'll ain't even made for one another
She a snake, Logan, gonna get you sprayed, brother
It's a set-up, seen it before, Doofy got wet up

[Ghostface Killah]
Nah, you paranoid, letting your mind, get the best of you
She would never set me up, or lace my drink
Watch how you talk it, you know I keep heat in the mink
You dead wrong, confusing her with one of your hoes
She's a ride or die, chick, believe me, a nigga knows
I'm the el capitan, put this whole squad together
Keep talking, bro, I put one in your leather
Bald cap, Logan'll do the hit, now that's better

[Outro: Cappadonna]
Ahh, man, come on, Tone, you sleepy eyes, man
I told you before, son, yo
You gotta stay focused out here, look
Look out the window, man, Luca's mob, son
You know who they are, them same muthafuckas
Yo, I seen her with them niggas before, she's a set-up chick</pre>
