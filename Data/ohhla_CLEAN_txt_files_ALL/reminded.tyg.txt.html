Song:   Reminded
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

She said if you love me let me know
If you don't then let me go

[Tyga]
The memories soon fade, why couldn't they be erased
You hoping it's just a phase, your heart'll heal within days
Some people think it's wrong, being single isn't right
But you hurt the right person you'll be wrong all your life
Inevitable to let you go, separate the sexual
Feelings when I'm close to you, fucking til' the sky is blue
Morning time, home fries, cooking with your t-shirt on
Panties, bra, damn I eat you good when you take it off
Ha, damn I'm nasty, I mean you make me nasty
Going the extra mile flying just to make me happy
Did it all, too much wasn't enough
Now it's gone but sometimes I sit and hope

[Adele]
I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

[Tyga]
Whatever ever happened to love and being happy
Infatuated with lust, I loved you and now I'm backwards
Time is of the essence, I broke it, took it for granted
Love is like art, heartbroken on the canvas
Painted the perfect picture, you seemed to never get it
Colors prevail and you turn into a fucking monster
Schizophrenic, nicknames Bonnie and Clyde
Now doctors calling us Mr. and Mrs. Hyde
How do you manage but still do you
Can't compromise, we all equal opportunists
It's when I'm level headed they aiming to take my head off
Birds flock together, tell bitches I'm throwing bread off
Cold, women, fall in love getting splintered?
Strictly plutonic, only thing she want is dinner
I can't fuck with her, get her some tonic, gin, liquor
She might let me lick her, now she miss me sayin

[Adele]
I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

[Tyga]
Angels in the a.m., sin on my flesh
Girls in the p.m., excuses PMS
They all wanna love em, call em Ms. Next
Spirit of a hustler, I only chase checks
Go home
I ain't tryna do you wrong
I'd rather be alone
Just sittin on the throne</pre>
