"Whassup now muthafuka?" (8X)

[El Da Sensai]
It goes like this then it goes like that
Artifacts yo we rap mad facts without no feedback
Bust a niggy down and clowns ? check my footmark
El sparks the dutch, quicker than the ? to God
Greater darker than Vader, state of the art don't start
My skills mad thrills while you're still cheap, like K-Mart
Ain't smart, mothereffer deffer all get aten
Steppin with my rap weapon, now who's testin?
This Mister El, sinister Brick City minister
Swingin with my nigga Tame, Boom Skwad adventure
Loc style, to the max, tax cats with no doubt
Bust your whole shit out, drunken with my chi style
Diesel Don, ism Gov'na rated all-stars
Up to par, baby pah, ease a Heine from the bar
When I'm with my peeps, we be deep for the shows
Rockin low pro, in the corner shootin cee-lo
Huff puff enough to keep your eyes bloodshot
Get more cocker spaniel move your ass like Daniel
To the left I step, super def, human being
Tame get on the mic, with the one two three and

[Tame One]
Pass off, I blast off, like Jetsons when I'm flexin
X'n wack tags and rap fags in ANY fuckin section
Watch the notty head G-Wiz get biz, word to Muensters
Peace to Daddy Reef and Money Stuntsa
A-Cool, my nigga Fat G roll the spliff
Jay Burnz and Mellow Max, my man Swift takes the flicks
A Hooterville killer with +Wild Styles+ like the movie
I light blunts with my right, in left I keep a toolie
The Boom Skwad president, ain't hesitant to represent
Elements that's relevant, diss bitches for the hell of it
I got much pride, electrin SLIDIN suckers backwards
Like Mike Jackson, throwin hats, the Artifacts hittin
G off, so won't you be off, because I'm peed off
Enough to fuck some stuff up, and rip another rough cut
My crew's paid mad dues, without no reimbursement
Verse after verse, the mic be Howlin like a Thirstin
And we out.. FUCK DAT!
