[ VERSE 1 ]
I walk the mean streets jackin' for funds, harrassin' black kids for fun
What seperates me is the badge and a gun
They call me Rambo, yeah you know, the cop who got grazed
Back in the days, chasin' niggas through your project maze
As fast as they ran, them monkeys never got away
If you slingin' in these parts, best believe I got a stake
A vested interest, if you resistin'
Get beat within inches of your life and then I spike the interest
I want in, you get 20, I want 10
You got 10, I want 5, pay attention or you'll die
Simple as that, I took a bite out of crime, got bitten back
Started sniffin' packs, beat my wife cause the bitch was fat
My son's a scumbag wigger, the kid thinks he's black
I guess it's just the good Lord's way of gettin' me back
On top of that shit ain't been right since '86 when my partner got 86ed
By some crazy mick, it made me flip
I'm out here shakin' down coons and prostitutes
Got snitches in every building - you get money, then we watchin' you
A dedicated team of sheisty cops, you want them white tiny rocks?
We control everything within 90 blocks

[ CHORUS (2X) ]
Protect and serve, that's a joke, steal coke and get rich
Fuck these animals, crackheads, niggers and spics
That's why I'm takin' your bricks, rapin' your bitch, you can't do shit
My badge prevent it, I'm a bad lieutenant

[ VERSE 2 ]
I sit in hallways snortin' cocaine
Buggin' out, chasin' niggers on my horse in the rain, this is pain
This is my wicked castle, my fortress to reign
Thats how I'm sportin' this chain and supportin' Loraine
And Teneesha, this black bitch I shack with
On nights I got the pitch black shift, and she sucks my white fat dick
When I get the coke she cuts it for me
Such a lovely story, rob niggers who hustle for me
See the thing thats fucked up, I set 'em up in drug busts
Take the money and pass the coke on to the next young dumb fuck
The ones who get cuffed'll never touch us
Cause the American jury system will never not trust us
This is how it works in the hood
Why you think there's so many guns, hoes and work in the hood?
I said, this is how it goes in the hood
Why you think there's so many guns, and dope and work in the hood?

[ CHORUS (2X) ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
I got a tip this kid wasn't breakin' bread, so I'ma take his bread
Break his head, he made his bed, next time I'ma make him dead
I seen him on the ave, he can't be more than 21
From a distance I watch the money come, yo, this dummy done
I hopped out and seen all of his dunnys run
He tried to bounce, but had a funny run, bum leg and his tummy plump
I ran up on him, gripped him up, put my knee on his back
Pistol-whipped his ass, made him bleed with the gat
Raped his pockets, took all his stacks
Told him he know the deal, the cops get a part of all of his packs
A kid named Nathaniel, he was blacker than a cocker spaniel
We searched his crib, found three ki's and lots of ammo
Day's work done, I went to get my knob slobbed
Teneesha was waitin' with fried chings and won tons
Sat back on the couch, put my back on slouch
Relaxed my feet up, then I put my joint in her mouth
She started suckin' it, thats when I heard the buck-buckin' and
The door kicked in, what the fuck is this?
Yeah, Nathanial come back to get his revenge
And sadly, this is where my twisted tale ends</pre>
