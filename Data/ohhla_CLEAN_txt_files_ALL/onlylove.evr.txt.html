Song:   Only Love Can Break Your Heart
Typed by: EattWhtysWhtyFrd@aol.com

When you were young and on your own
How did it feel to  be alone
I was always thinking of games that I was playing
Trying to make the best of my time

{Chorus}
But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart

I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Someone should call him and see if he can come out
Try to lose the down that he's found

{Chorus}

I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart</pre>
