*repeat x3*

Verse 1: Dray

Well I'ma freakit like this so then my nigga Books is next
The crew is from the sewer when the crew is Das EFX
I wrecks cos when I flex I gots ta rip it
Excuse me if some brew it makes me woozy when I sip it
I'm wicked so let me kick it, I got my crew in
I rips just for kicks, I got more dicks than *?Perduin?*
I pick em, pluck em, stuck em wit my cock an'
no my name ain't Santa but here's somethin for ya stockin
I'm rockin, I got'cha Glock and I'm from the under
Down to take my sound because it's bound to make ya wonder

Chorus:

Well I'ma freakit like that, and I'ma freakit like this
Well I'ma freakit like that, and I'ma freakit like this
Well I'ma freakit like that, and I'ma freakit like this
Well I'ma freakit like that, and watch me freakit like this

Verse 2: Books

Well I'm freakit like dat wit more maneovers than the Heimlich
when I rhyme wit the Krayz vertebraes in your spine-git
Chills, rippin up the skills, I'm like wholesome
and if the mic was paid so then my dollar run the Boston
So just work it up and I'll be glad to blast they ass
out the socket when I rock it like NASA
and plus I'm gettin hysterical wit my lyrical concoctions
I take it to the top then hook up pops and
I'm dope when I'm slingin more hits than the Oakland A's
I freakit like dat and then I'm swayz

Chorus:

Well I'ma freakit like this, and I'ma freakit like that
*repeat x3*

Verse 3: Dray

Well I'ma freakit like this because I be doper than the dopest
I focus on the mic and if you like it you can quote this
I wrote this, I smoke this mic until it's heated
The kid he tried ta battle me but then he got defeated
I'm wheated, don't need that, no keep that, no sell-out
cos if I ever do you know my crew'll get the hell out
I'm quipped with the lingo, my thing go for days
I flip it when I rip it cos I like what it pays
I'm dip dodge dope, y'know I'm gonna get'cha
cos now I rocks the mic just like a battle was a pitcher

Chorus:

Well I'm freakit like that, and I'ma freakit like this
*repeat x3*

Verse 4: Books

Well I'ma freakit like that cos black I bust caps with roughrats
and plus I does the *?sub dat?*, flip scripts and dust chaps
off with the quickness, I'm wicked with the propaganda
and hot damn, I got more props than that Fox Samantha
The hickory-dick slickest nigga wit the
raps that sound nifty, wait around to pound sixty
I'm freakin the rap slurries witta black skullie hat on
I'm sweepin on chucks like niggas knew me from the platform
I'm dope when I'm swingin more hits than the Oakland A's
I freakit like dat and then I'm swayz

Chorus:

Well I'ma freakit like this, and I'ma freakit like that
