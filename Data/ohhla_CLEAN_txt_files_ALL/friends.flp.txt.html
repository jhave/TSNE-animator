Get get your ass up (yeah)
And raise your glass up (yeah)
If you feeling alright (yeah)
Then we going all night (hey)
We worked we struggled
Our dues is paid
We ride through trouble
Go against the grain
These highs these lows, this life we chose
Some here some gone
But we still stand right here strong
My soldiers, my team
Our future our dreams
Don't hate us, we kings
It's our time to shine, na mean (ay)
It's like back to back
Bicycles to bucket to the lac
In the club with the bucket in the back
Glass high clink clink, dap

[CHORUS]
So lift your glasses high
Up to the sky
Another round for me and my friends
It feels so good
We living the life
Cause all I need is me and my friends

I'm looking for a new friend
Would you be my new friend
Yeah we all need somebody
You could be my club buddy
I'm looking for a new friend
Would you be my new friend
Like the way I work my body
I could be your club buddy

So get your ass up (yeah
And raise your glass up (yeah)
If you felling alright (yeah)
Then we going all night (hey)
So get your ass up (yeah
And raise your glass up (yeah)
If you felling alright (yeah)
Then we going all night (hey)

I came up in here just to chill
And hang out with my friends
You called me over now I'm twisted
You go me thinking
That tonight I just might
Come and sit with you (oo)
Better yet I'll get me crew
To come kick it with your crew
Because it's ladies night
And we all looking tight
And you're out with your boys
Let's go and make some noise
Little game of five on five
I'm showing all my moves
You can make a new friend
But boy you got to choose

[CHORUS]
So lift your glasses high
Up to the sky
Another round for me and my friends
It feels so good
We living the life
Cause all I need is me and my friends

I'm looking for a new friend
Would you be my new friend
Yeah we all need somebody
You could be my club buddy
I'm looking for a new friend
Would you be my new friend
Like the way I work my body

I ain't got no home to lay my head
So I'm up in the club or close to dead
On the other side is paradise so get fed
Through the love my friends'll get fed
So lift your glasses high up to the sky
This is for my friends who's time have passed by
So we're lifting our voices up to the sky
Bringing home one love I got to get by
Grab hold the song or just roll and ride
So lift your glasses high up to the sky
So get your ass up (yeah)
And raise your glass up (yeah)
If you feeling alright (yeah)
Then we going all night (hey)
So get your ass up (yeah)
And raise your glass up (yeah)
If you feeling alright (yeah)
Then we going all night (hey)
So lift your glasses high
Up to the sky
Another round for me and my friends
It feels so good
