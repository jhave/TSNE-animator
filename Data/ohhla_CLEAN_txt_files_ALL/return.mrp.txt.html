It's oahkay mayn!  Yeh it's oahkay (it's oahkay mayn)
They don't wanna see you retire mayn (uh-ahh)
Why dey wanna fuck witchu?  Why do they wanna fuck witchu?

[Silkk, punctuated by gunshots]
YO hah YO hah YO hah

Look what y'all made me do nigga, we just tryin to live
Crossed the family one time, and we ain't tryin to forgive
We ain't nuttin but some thug niggaz that's, trapped in crime
And how we end our beef?  We click clack them nines
I was taught at the beginning {*two shots*} taught to win it
{*two shots*} DON'T FUCK WIT ME MAYN!
{*rapid fire*} I got a short temper
Niggaz spreadin rumors tappin our phones make a nigga, wanna do bad
? get money stashed, ? on his ass
Foreign cars with at least a hundred on dash
(You thought you'd be paid right?)  But not this rich
Thought about a, 4 or 5, then a brother betta, cop me a 6
Now find me in the studio somewhere, droppin hits
Overlookin the product somewhere, choppin bricks
We makin the hood, or we gon' TAKE IT TO THE HOOD
Yeah we gangsters difference between us and y'all
WE MAKE IT LOOK GOOD
TAKE E'RYTHING DEEP {*two shots*} go all out {*two shots*}
{*rapid fire*} Said E'RYTHING - y'all know what we about

[Master P]
If you a soldier, then raise your rags
But if you a hater, you better hide your flags
But if you a soldier, then raise your rags
But if you a hater, you better hide your flags
Now if you a soldier, raise your rags
But if you a hater, you better hide your flags
But if you a soldier, raise your rags
But if you a hater, you better hide your flags

I told y'all the ghetto was a trap, but y'all fools didn't listen
I mean you like to cut class that's why you always missin
Are you broke, are you old, are you rich, are you cold
Are you mad at me cause yo' shit didn't go gold?
Take a slug to the dome nigga {*two shots*} boo-yaa boo-yaa {*two shots*}
{*rapid fire*} Cause I squeeze the fuckin trigger, ha hahh!
Now I'm back for revenge nigga, fuck your friends
I got automatic weapons that'll, do you in
Fuck with SILKK, then you fuckin with P
But if you FUCK WITH MY MONEY, then you fuckin with me
See it's real out in the streets and y'all niggaz be fakin
We all about the cheddar y'all bout grits and bacon
I'm bout gettin paid for life, y'all bout livin trife
And that Benz that you lovin, I had it the other night
Ya heard me? {*two shots*} Hoody Hooooo! Two mo' nigga! {*two shots*}
{*rapid fire*}</pre>
