Yeah.
It's a blast from the past from the old G's to the new G's.
Tell ya later, check it out.

I bought a ticket, got an aisle seat
I was ready for that good ol' gangsta flick
And then all at once, an angel sit down on next to me
So I had to think of something quick
So what should I do
I said "excuse me, have I seen you somewhere before"
And then she smiled at me with big brown eyes
We talked and talked as the gangsta shot up the town
And sure enough she was in my arms
As they brought that curtain down

Chorus
Oh I met my baby at the (bang bang, gotcha) shoot'm up movie
During the gun fight we fell in love
Oh I met my baby at the (bang bang, gotcha) shoot'm up movie girl

I once knew I wouldn't see this movie through
I was so loss gazing into her eyes
Yeah, she shared my popcorn, we shared a kiss
Then she whispered "I love you" to my surprise
The part she row it as the gangsters made the get away
And there we were falling in love, oh I'll never forget that day

[Mo B. Dick - Chorus]
Chorus

Shoot'm up, shoot'm up movies girl
And while the good guys and the bad guys was fighting it up we met arose
Had a good ol gangsta movie, shoot'm up
Shoot'm up, shoot'm up movies girl

Oh I met my baby at the (bang bang, gotcha) shoot'm up, shoot'm up movies girl</pre>
