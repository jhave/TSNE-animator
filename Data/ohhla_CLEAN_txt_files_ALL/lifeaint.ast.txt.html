[Astonish]
I paint a picture with words
Trying to find the right color that describe a nigga pitching them birds
Hitting the herb, my people trying to make it out the street
But they hardly ever get to the curb, ain't nothing sweet
Busting heat like it's going out of style
Fiends running for the rock like it's going out of bounds
Enough to make you frown but we smile at the face of death
Send me to hell, I'm too cool to break a sweat
It's now or later nigga, dying's got a waiting list
Living this life will turn a nigga to an atheist
Thinking if Christ really cared
He'll take some of these muthafucking bullets out the air
But living isn't fair and dying cheat a little too
Good die young, niggas was dropping out of middle school
Carrying the heat till they bury me a G
I'm fighting like a man, only scary niggas flee
This is me nigga

[Chorus]
You know what it is, you know what we about
That brown paper bag dough, money in the couch
Cuz life ain't sweet and life ain't fair
So I'm a grind till my life ain't there
That's how it be nigga
You know what it is, you know what we about
That brown paper bag dough, money in the couch
Cuz life ain't sweet and life ain't fair
So I'm a grind till my life ain't there
This is me nigga

[Termanology]
You thought I wasn't going to make it but I'm taking
A eight and lacing it up with base and chase right in front of Jacob
To celebrate the age of the day that I raised the stakes up
Remember the days when I razor blade and chopped the place up
Remember the rage of the enemies that shot the place up
If anything I should lace up all their faces with a razor
Montana paper, I'm the ganja blazer
Till my eyes looking like Dan the Automator
Blazing the lime green, I stay with a grime team
Ever since 19 had a perfect rhyme scheme
So if you commercial and So So Def
Or underground as a Rawkus I'll turn you into a caucus
I've been starving, labor pain shit
Given birth to many styles, piranha niggas bit (that's life)
Hate to sound pissed but life ain't sweet
I'll go out with my gun blazing before I call the police
That's me

[Chorus]

[Astonish]
Ain't got the life a nigga dream about
I'm living what these other rappers sing about, trying to find a decent route
If niggas with skills was getting the deals
Then I'll be pushing a Beamer out and not a DeVille
Struggling to help my Ma with the bills that's pilling up
High as fuck, I'm trying to find the answer in a dutch
Got an arsenal that turn the hardest nigga to a marshmallow
Walking a thin line, my life is like a carnival
Ring the alarm and bring me a bomb
So I could blow up but I ain't never read the Qur'an
So I ain't taking about a terrorist sect
Me and Term, that's my word, couldn't find a better pair in the batch
Hate it or love it, but you could never say that we fronted
But we been fronted on cuz niggas be hating for nothing
But I'm a ride until the die that I expire
And to all of y'all I give my all like Mariah
You know me

[Chorus x2]</pre>
