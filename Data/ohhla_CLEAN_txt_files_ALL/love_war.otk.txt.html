[Hook]
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do whats right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for? (repeat)

[Verse]
Tonight we'll make the prettiest song that no one will ever hear
No one will ever hear
No one will ever
These ain't the times to be alone cliche the end is near
Cliche the end is near
Cliche the end is
Quickly approaching while we carry on
No one is promised another day
Why can't the story end like fairytales often do
Before I let you leave I've got to say-ay-ay-ay

[Hook]

(Instrumental)
