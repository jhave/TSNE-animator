[Intro: Hell Razah]
Struggles.. in the ghetto, going through hell to come out right
This is what we must go through to reach heaven
That's what we go through
This what we go through to reach heaven to escape hell

[Chorus 4X: Hell Razah]
In the Days of Our Lives we got One Life to Live
As the World Turns around negative through positive
At the edge of the nights, The Guiding Light
That leads to Another World
For the Young and the Restless beware of your Deathwish
To All My Children in the General Hospital
The most impossible
We got for you the final saga of the Street Operas

[Killah Priest]
In my location is where they run the operation
You either stuck or getting bucked by the train station
Word is bond if beyond after dawn, they hit you up bad
And watch drop and they gone, they 9mm's
Make bitches scream high-pitch like a tweater
But shorty is a strong believer when he hold his heater
I use an ounce of my mind to make rhymes
And a half of my brain to cause rain
Cuz life is like a game with no instructions
Streets they be tusslin' to have a brother bustin'
They adolescence carry weapons in they section, a wrong direction
When they all pack protection, forgotten knowledge, is all symbolic
And heathenistic, they need statistics, for cops to search
Yhey pop you first and dig your pockets later
And maybe catch you for money and your pager (gimme that)
Or slice your throat with the razor.
An old man told me once, sitting on a chair rolling a blunt
"I had a son your age, that ended up on front page
From the impact of a 12 Gauge, his assassination
Drove me in a world of hatred, today it's hard to face it"
He showed me old flicks, he was up for a scholarship
But it ended by a hollow tip
Damn I never thought life could be so short
I still see him on the basketball court
Fought in my life, I shedded great tears
Tryin' to escape here, but for me it might take years
Walk towards these fears and I'm still here.
He rolled back in his wheelchair
and said, "The streets is vicious
and all the witches play you for your riches
They blow you kisses and show you stitches"
So then he pulled back his pictures

[Chorus - replace "beware of your Deathwish" with "expect the unexpected"]
[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Hell Razah]
The final saga of the street operas, of the street operas
The final saga of the street operas
Bible shit..
