[Intro/Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Girls look better in a real tight sweater {*5X*}
Girls girls look better in a real tight sweat
Girls look better in a real tight sweater
Tight sweater, tight-ti-ti, tight sweater {*2X*}
Girls look better in a real tight sweater {*2X*}
Girls girls look better in a real tight sweater

[Childish Gambino]
Girls look better in a real tight sweater
Gambino on the mic make the pussy much wetter
Try to get the girls, call the guy go getter
Tight jeans and Converse sneakers (tight sweater)
No cheddar, go home in a rogue letter
It's a college center, so my financial aid's better
You better dead her, yo that girl's goin crazy
She got a twinkle in her eye like she wants to have a baby
Maybe I should call her up on a Saturday
Take her to a dinner and a movie, Braves game, maybe
we can call her up again
You lookin good girl, you should bring your friends
And I don't really talk shit, I'm a douche and a bad rapper
I'd act faster, but my tongue's in a black plaster
If your girl shops in sizes that are too small let her
cause girls look better in a real tight sweater

[Chorus]</pre>
