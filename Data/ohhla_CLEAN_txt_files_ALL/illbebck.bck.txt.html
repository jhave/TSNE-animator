[Intro]
Aye Drama, hold up fo' a sec' aiight
Stop dat gangsta shit fo' dis niggas one time
Cut dat shit tha fuck off right now, ya'undastand
Dis niggas ain't fuckin' payin' attention
They not seen what df is goin' on 
It's a movement nigga, G-Unit South!
Git wit' it or live wit' out nigga!!
You know whudd it is when you see me in tha mothafuckin' streets
Let's Goooo!!
(G-Unit!!)
 
[Verse 1]
As the world turn, let tha weed burn
I need mine and I know dat you need yours
Shit ain't all good but tha hood still got my back
And believe dat I got my strap (Get 'Em Buck!!)
I don't wanna hear bout tha shit you've been thru
Niggas all know bout the {?}
You ain't got to sit to me if it offends you
But come thru, show me love and I'll defend you (Owh!)
See me on tha news, be like: "Damn dat's ugly"
So like 'Pac sayd: "Only God can judge me"
Six rocks left 'till my packets gon' (Yeaaahh)
On tha block by myself I ain't got no home
Niggas gittin' at my bitch in tha club
Tellin' her to holla soon as I'm locked up
So damnit it's on me now, I can make 'em famous (Whudd!)
By standin' by a nigga labeled "Armed &amp; Dangerous"
But don't no body really see tha picture
And do ya see ya momma face starrin' at some tissue?
I made my mind up befo' I got a record deal
You can make fake money, but tha respect is real
 
[Hook]
Even if I did they gon' say I didn't
Even if I ain't they gon' say I'm wit' it
We hustle all nite out here trynnah git it (C'monn)
So even if I gotta lay down fo' a minute (Owh!)
I be back.. (Same ol' nigga) I be back.. (Whudd)
(Just got a lil' bigga) I be back, (C'monn)
(One mo' time) I be back, (Fo'sho)
To git what's mine
 
[Verse 2]
Day dreamin', thankin' where they gon' send me (Huh!)
I'm doin' bout a hunned in dis {?}
And they don't see me sweat, so I smile thru it all (Yuh!)
I see tha blue lights but I'm thankin' "Hayell no" (Nooo!)
I wanna do right, but they tell me dat I'm wrong
Fo' doin' 35 in durrty speed zone (Dayum)
I should've called 50, tell him I'm pulled ova (Nah!)
But he know I'm strap'd and he know I ain't soba
So lemme take a deep breathe, put my seatbelt on
When he walks to tha car, holla back - we gone
I gotta case pinned on me and I'm out on bars
So he gon' have his trynnah handcuff my arms
And he gon' have 20 niggas trynnah do him wrong
When only he had to do is sit back and be gon'
Fuck tha D.E.A. and tha Feds
Git money mothafucka, you can sleep when ya dead (Yuh!)
 
[Hook]
Even if I did they gon' say I didn't
Even if I ain't they gon' say I'm wit' it (Yuh!)
We hustle all nite out here trynnah git it (C'monn)
So even if I gotta lay down fo' a minute (Owh!)
I be back.. (Same ol' nigga) I be back.. (Whudd)
(Just got a lil' bigga) I be back, (C'monn)
(One mo' time) I be back, (Fo'sho)
To git what's mine</pre>
