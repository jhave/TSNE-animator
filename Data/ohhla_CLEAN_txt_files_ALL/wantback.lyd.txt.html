Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uh!
Mmm, yeah
La la la la laaa
Uh!

Hey, boy you never had much game
Thought I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away way way
Uh
Now, I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns clowns clowns
Uh

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this
Uh
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this
Uh

Boy you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya
I want you back
I want you back
Wa-want you, want you back
Uh
I broke it off thinking you'd be cryin'
Now I feel like shh looking at you flyin'
I want you back
I want you back
Wa-want you, want you back
Uh

Please, this ain't even jealousy (jealousy)
She ain't got a thing on me (a thing on me)
Tryin' to rock them ugly jeans jeans jeans
Uh
You clearly didn't think this through
If what I've been told is true (is it true?)
You'll be crawling back like boo hoo hoo
Uh

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this
Uh
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this
Uh

Boy you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya
I want you back
I want you back
Wa-want you, want you back
Uh
I broke it off thinking you'd be cryin'
Now I feel like shh looking at you flyin'
I want you back
I want you back
Wa-want you, want you back
Uh

Ooh, I thought you'd still be mine
When I kissed you goodbye uh oh uh oh
Ooh, and you might be with her
But I still had you first uh oh uh oh

[Astro - rap verse]
Let's go! Astro!
We used to be, but now there's a separation between you and me
Baby I'm moving on to another girl that understands me more
Dated her in front your place so you can see it all
I remember the times, when we used to bond
But I never realized that you wanted to be mine
So I gave her the ring, instead of you, nickname too
I can tell that you're upset, because it ain't you
Met a new girl, and I gave her my heart
Not noticing that you wanted me from the very start
You want me back?
We can just be friends, don't try this thing all over again
Come on

Ohhh-Oh-oh-oh
Boy you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya
I want you back
I want you back
Wa-want you, want you back
Uh
I broke it off thinking you'd be cryin'
Now I feel like shh looking at you flyin'
I want you back
I want you back
Wa-want you, want you back
Uh la la la la laaa

(Let me know)

Ohhh, I want you back
I want you back
Wa-want you, want you back
Uh

Ohhh, I want you back
I want you back
Wa-want you, want you back
Uh

Does I sound like a helicopter (bbbbbbrrrrrddddd)?</pre>
