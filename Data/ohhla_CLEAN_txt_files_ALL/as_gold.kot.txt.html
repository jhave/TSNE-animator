I snapped a load, watch it glow, glow, glow
Looks so fruity sittin' in my bowl
Thanks to Mary, Jane is my bro
Glow baby, glow baby, grow baby, glow

If you ask me how I'm living, my reply is 'I'm sold'
Smoked out, without a doubt
I keep a constant flow, of indo smoke pouring out my lungs
And you can strip to find a stash on the tip of my tongue
Marijuana, running through my veins
God's great gift comes in different strains
&gt;From the mainland (purps?) all the way to big island
Underground cultivation, yes I try to stay blasted
&gt;From to sea to sea, and I've also been known to plant seed after seed
Seven points on my flag when it's blowing in the wind
Prop 215 so let the games begin
Smoke as much as you want, Johnny Richter's everlastin
When you packin' a sacks, (??)
Your plants don't grow in that bud that be glowin
For once you have to ask, all the people never knowin

I snapped a load, watch it glow, glow, glow
Looks so fruity sittin' in my bowl
Thanks to Mary, Jane is my bro
Glow baby, glow baby, grow baby, glow

Yo, I can barely breathe, I need to kick a verse
The smoke's on my mind, and it's getting on my nerves
Observe, don't wanna look at my lungs
Shriveled like an old peach, pear, plum
Nicotine, I'd rather smoke some green
What does it take, and why do I fiend?
If I conquer this kick, I'd be crowned king
Wasting my money, four bucks a pack
Going out of my way for some dirt sticks at that
It's gettin to be crap, I'm all up out of wack
But I'm rowdy, I need to buy a patch 
The dirty little camel is makin' me weeze
Go around to the castle where there's bongs and weed
I need to take a shit, got no time to think
There's a zong by the toilet, and some bud on the sink
Some bud on the sink, some bud on the sink

I snapped a load, watch it glow, glow, glow
Looks so fruity sittin' in my bowl
Thanks to Mary, Jane is my bro
Glow baby, glow baby, grow baby, glow

I knew a real stoner named D-Loc
Never went to sleep, smoked weed till the sun broke
Up all night with his pipe, puffin' indo
Evaporated herb, like dilapidating ozone
Sack after sack, after sack, now he's flat broke
About to get faded, take a toke, while the tape rolls
Kottonmouth Kings write rhymes on hemp stones
Daddy X don't smoke, and (??)
Save the best of the best, when pack it in the vest
You know the THC content you will never guess
Unless you invest, we can put it to the test
There's no stress for the cess, we all about the next guest
(??), now our minds spun
We in a whole new place, lowered the lights
Bud stickin, laced, fruit taste, sticky
Nothing but dank, number one rank
No need to rush, sippin' buds by the crops
Those little red rocks in the hydroponic box
To keep the plants kissin, we got a drip system
Electronical device, liquid dice
(??) to the fullest and beautiful kolas
One puff, you clueless, to all you rookie smokers
(??) was stun, relation was won
We love to see our plants looki' pretty in the sun

I snapped a load, watch it glow, glow, glow
