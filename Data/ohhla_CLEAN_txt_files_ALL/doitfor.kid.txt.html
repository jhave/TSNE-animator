Been sittin' alone thinkin' bout the past
Another lonely night, another empty glass
This path I'm walking always seems to lead nowhere
I wonder how much you think of me
How we used to laugh, how we used to be
It seems like freedom has never had a man so scared

Times might change, love it comes and goes
How I wish I could have shown you how deep for you my love goes
And I know this might seem crazy, I would end my life for you
You know I don't want to, but I'd do it for you
Hey I'd do it for you

I wonder how much you think of me
It hurts to think the past is all that you can see
Now it seems like freedom is better then the love we shared

Times they change, love it comes and goes
How I wished I would have shown you how deep for you my love goes
And I know this might sound crazy, I would end my life for you
You know I don't want to, but I'd do it for you
Yeah, I'd do it for you

Listen to me
I wonder how long it takes to see
There's nothing more I want than you here with me
Freedom's been knocking, but I refuse to let her in

Times they change, love it comes and goes
How I wished I would have shown you how deep for you my love goes
And I know this might sound crazy, I would end my life for you
You know I want to come back home and care for you
And baby I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything, for you</pre>
