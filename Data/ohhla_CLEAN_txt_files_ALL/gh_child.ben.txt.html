[Intro: Bobby Brown]
Yo, this is B Brown
We gon lay ya back on this Benzino track, right
Two times

[Chorus 2x: Female] (Bobby Brown) 
Eye for an eye (Ghetto, ghetto)
Strong will survive (Yeah, yeah)
Everyday struggle to stay alive 
Look deep inside (My ghetto child)
Bet cha wanna ride
Ghetto child gon learn to fly (Ghetto child)

[Bobby Brown]
Now being born in the ghetto, it's hard, believe me
Not just a job, anything ain't easy
You go through rough times, you go through hard times
And times even tougher than that
But what I got is a mans best friend
I know I'll fail staying in a house that your bed shield
Brothers'll stick you up and in it they'll take pride
Only bulletproof is if you don't need outside
It's a living hell, you got to be the guy
Cause if not, you get popped, ya be another victim of homicide
Peer pressure pounds and if you ain't stressful
You got to be live-full
Black to feed the back
Never second guess a professor  
Your not see-through, your not even equal
But that's the price you pay being born in the ghetto [*in the ghetto* echoes] 

[Chorus 2x]

[Mr. Gzus]
Let me explain to you, un-hunh, some game is the truth
Mainly I speak to the youth
I used to hustle drugs with a crew
I was young and green and hungry, what's a nigga to do?
We used to smoke weed on the roof and let the ions loose
While shorty saw us off the ninety proof
Lost to the streets
Loved to rhyme so throw me a beat and flow would make the joint complete
At the same time I gots ta eat
Took a stands, stole a seat jumped in the game to compete
Unaware of the heat, there's was def from cheek to cheek
No sleep for two weeks stated all kinds of beef
Been through hell and back before I was grown
No pops to teach me to how spread my wings and fly, I did that on my own
Made it this far and I'ma keep goin
Y'all ain't knowin, I'm still here and keep growin, from a ghetto child

[Chorus 2x]

[Bobby Brown]
It ain't nothing about hits
It's about these grits
Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
Born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
Being born in the...
Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto
Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto
Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto
Being born in the ghetto
Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
Don't make it up, don't make it up

[Chorus 2x]
