[Buckshot]
Let the games begin...
Buckshot, Da BDI
Tek N Steele, The Cocoa Brovaz
And Aaliyah
Doin it like this

[Aaliyah]
You can ride with me (x6)

[Steele]
Experience this, you and I ridin on a natural mist
Wit me and my gunz, we still # 1, like this
Black Smif-N-Wessun on da top of you list
Mysterious, individual ST doubly a league
Creap on da scene on da double D on da 18 inch
Risin, tryin to get right midnight
Makin moves wit my crewz on dirt bikes
Eyes straight up, keep my head capped up
Linked up wit my Cocoa B'z, cocoa treez
Keep u on a level where we flow on
Like boats in da ocean, like teachin Sean ?

Chorus

[Tek]
Da night is major, read a ? splashin on my pager
Preparin fo our gig in a slowed up ?
wit money makers who hold da tables down in Vegas
Talkin bout da games, the homies sold by from da Lakers
It's all da same, different faces and names
Da conversation changes, ya hoes run for cream
? quicka and new friends come 'round
But forget where you from, let's get laid down
Super cat of this rap, don't own no plaques
But I'm posin wit Aaliyah for da plastic
And catch da night breeze as we burn down treez
Ridin in da buggy, got 3 to NYC

Chorus

[Buckshot (repeat first 2 lines x2)]
What y'all people here to represent?  Boot Camp
What we here to represent?  Boot Camp
When you come on down ya see ST
When you come on down ya see Smokey Lah
When you come on down ya see BDB
When you come on down ya see BCC

Buckshot be da # 1 chance, speedin fast
Like Ramadon, plus I blow da amp and da fuse
Buck be da boss, ya lose if ya toss
Must of got tossed at da road
Of course da most popular
When I'm rockin ya, BCC steady knockin ya
Lookin at da box, duece duece
And woofers in my trunk, 4 lights
And likes to get pull lights
And watch me as I dump, one nation baby
Boot Camp and Aaliyah drive ya crazy
Ya wanna see us

[Aaliyah]
You can ride wit me, you can ride wit me
C'mon and ride wit me, ride wit BCC
You can ride wit me, You can ride wit me
C'Mon and ride wit me, you can ride wit me
we ride, we ride, we ride, we ride, we ride

Night riders, ni-night riders, we ride (repeat to fade)</pre>
