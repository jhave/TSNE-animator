[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Mass hallucination, baby...
Ill education, baby...
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
of a prisoner on his way, trapped inside your desire
To fire bullets that stray; track attire just tell you 
I'm tired and ran away, I should ask a choir what do you require
to sing a song that acquire me to have faith
As the record spin I should pray; for the record I recognize 
that I'm easily prey, I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building, it's probably big as a building
Me jumping off of the roof is me just playing it safe
But what am I supposed to do when the topic is red or blue?
And you understand that I ain't but know I'm accustomed to 
Just a couple that look for trouble and live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wondering if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind because one day you'll respect, the "good kid, m.A.A.d. city"

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
All I see is strobe lights, blinding me in my hindsight
Finding me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose to persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do with the blinking of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask, "Lift up your shirt" cause you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter: "He's probably young but I know that he's down"
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
He don't mind, he know we'll never respect, the "good kid, m.A.A.d. city"

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
All I see in this room: 20 Xanies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane society
It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20 Xanies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy I lost it, I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, cause now you ever in debt to "good kid, m.A.A.d. city"
