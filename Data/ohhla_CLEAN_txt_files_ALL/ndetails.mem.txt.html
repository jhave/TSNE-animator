[Prevail]
Who needs witnesses when my tag's all over the body bag
I took prodigy protraction, never the flow with action
Shot words like George Jackson, spit rings like Danny Saturn
Uncanny pattern is irregular, king's suffocation
Cannibal crush and rush a competitor through the radiator
Generation accelerator, critical movement
My mic is an armored tank, you can draw your own conclusion
One spike per person, swing when you wish
Of course you'll miss and thrust it through your own asophogus
I'll dump a building on it's windows, carry the elevator
Compare us to someone else, I'll bury the escavator
You'll need a brigade of spades, a deck full of jacks
Not to turn the perephiful terminal Diamondbacks
My mind's with pompay as my mouth is with the bomb bayers
Watch out, my powerhouse, watch these systems generate

Don't tamper with this template, it's definately different
Twists and turns, burning a permanent imprint
Scarred for life, I'm rifling through this verse
The last one to disperse, the first to cast a curse
Take full form, we swarm, abnormally hot
Undergrounding surround sound, that's how we rock
Fully loaded and cocked, devoted to exploding
It's been told I showed you how to break the mold and fold the knot
Alot of tension within, afraid to unlatch it
I might get carried away and bury the hatchet
A basket case, get carried away in the casket
[Prevail]
Man, are you a bastard
[Mad Child]
No, I'm very inventive
Demented I can sense the undead just past the entrance
I'm sick with every sentence but it's not that simple
I'm simply complicated, we shine experimental
Energy derived from the center of this temple

Excel as I'm prepelling and my element yelling
Full of adrenalin and I tell them I'm a felon and a gentleman
I've been along the wrong road, old habits die hard
Now I chose a righter path but I'm left mentally scarred
[Prevail]
Prevail in sleet and hail, who beats them down like nails
Heals the pale, Scorpions wail, drink fire water ale
Inhale the meal of steel rails
Then I swing my back tail and dent your detail
[Mad Child]
While I'm cracking with a emmaculate tactics acting up
Respectable form, perfected an electrical storm
Expect that I'm exceptional, full blown profession
We reserve the right to conserve while in congression
