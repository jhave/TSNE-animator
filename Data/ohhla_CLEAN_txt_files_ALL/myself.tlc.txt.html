Yo, get, get up on the TLC tip
Get, get up on the TLC tip
Hey now

You know how to pull my chain
And I believe every word you say
But now it's time we must say goodbye
Baby I'm leaving so don't you cry

I tried to make things work
But now you're gone and your heart got hurt
Well you thought I belong to you
But you were wrong so now what ya gon' do

[Chorus:]
Bad by myself
I can do bad, bad by my damn self
I can do bad by myself
Yo I done it before and I can do it again
Sho don't need you to be my man

Don't come bangin' on my door
Now you're gone I don't want you anymore
There's no reason for you to come around
So just step off so I don't have to break it down

I know what I'm doin' now
You think you're gonna change my mind somehow
You cheated me now I'm cheatin' back
I run the show and you can kiss my
You know the rest

You Left Eye what it is

My soda crack o' my ackra back o' da "T" To da "B" to da "O" to 
Da "Z" and C.H.I wit da double LI. L.E.F.T.E.Y.E. Eye E.I.E.I.O.
So yo how's ya linin' 
I was givin' a niggah a piece o' time
But my time can't be wasted on B.S.
So nevermind

[Chorus]

You I can do bad all by byself
I sho don't need you and anyone else
I ain't gonna be a fool no more
Better take that mess on out the door
Tried to ruin my world 
Tried to run my life
Must be crazy thinkin' I'm your wife
Yo I done it before and I can do it again
Sho don't need you to be my man

Yep, yep (hey) get up on the TLC tip

[Chorus]

Yo if Peter Piper weas to pick ya know a peck o' those pickled
Peppers gave his girly little Shirley half a peck
He could've kept her but instead da picklehead
Was kicked out da waterbad
And greedy Petey now is needy cause not one was all that he left her
Oooooooh I'm sayin' it once and not twice
Givin' advice to be nice before you fall through the ice
Cause lately you been slippin' up a lot
Not even givin' half o' what you got
But it's about that time you gave a quarter for a dime
Shovel up and start diggin' to see what you can find
That security deposit
So like it or leave it but until I receive it
I'll be leavin' my deposit elsewhere 
You best belive it
And that way we can both take a trip
Oooh on the TLC tip

Now that's the one</pre>
