Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's been a long time coming so we're here to wake the dead
Shake yo! Some songs get low, we're bout to break bread!
And our midnight show is not like midnight upfront
We lie, got long, Get over it and atleast dont get this very wrong
And toss it up.. and watch em dollar bills come sprinkling down
girl bend over pick it from the ground
And toss it up.. and watch em dollar bills come sprinkling down
girl bend over pick it from the ground, and toss it up!

Everybody on a thing like damn thing
Everybody dont die in the same game
Homie dont stand on the campaign
Lay back like it's not you who's champion

Lay back, we won, one time, we get all high, to the b like close to
We go, we ride, we go, we fly, we're perfect from the heat we go to

Convict, we're not sick less, getting everybody to launch sickness
then the hole game popped yo pretty dick
Fly high, Flipsyde and evolution
you need that treat that clean that we step we fly get em up 
nd we got to and feel that day and we come your way wait dead
and brotha I got you

It's been a long time coming so we're here to wake the dead
Shake yo! Some songs get low, we're bout to break bread!
And our midnight show is not like midnight upfront
We lie, got long, Get over it and atleast dont get this very wrong
And toss it up.. and watch em dollar bills come sprinkling down
girl bend over pick it from the ground
And toss it up.. and watch em dollar bills come sprinkling down
girl bend over pick it from the ground, and toss it up!

It's been a long time coming so we're here to wake the dead
Shake yo! Some songs get low, we're bout to break bread!
And our midnight show is not like midnight upfront
We lie, got long, Get over it and atleast dont get this very wrong
And toss it up.. and watch em dollar bills come sprinkling down girl

And toss it up.. and watch em dollar bills come sprinkling down girl
bend over pick it from the ground, and toss it up!

Everybody knows that (Yes!) everybody shows that that's enough

It's been a long time coming so we hit the way today
And our midnight show is not like midnight upfront

It's been a long time coming so we're here to wake the dead
Shake yo! Some songs get low, we're bout to break bread!
And our midnight show is not like midnight upfront
We lie, got long, Get over it and atleast dont get this very wrong
And toss it up.. and watch em dollar bills come sprinkling down
girl bend over pick it from the ground
And toss it up.. and watch em dollar bills come sprinkling down
girl bend over pick it from the ground, and toss it up!</pre>
