I believe... that's love, that's love
I believe... that's love
I believe... that's love, that's love
I believe... that's love
I believe... love, love

[Q-Tip]
Uh, of the things we believe
There's a whole lot of work, we should roll up our sleeves
And we got to hold firm when fateful sight conceiving
Why doubt your plans? Cause it's all worth believing
We can make it work, do believe that
Weave mistrust in the dust and believe fact
We can achieve tact by tuning out negative feedback
Naysayers can hate, we concentrate to bring belief back
Into ourselves, into the world, into the rap game
Emcees are miserable, their music should be leaving mics maimed
Man, look we holding out for the truth
If we alone in the Louvre we gone hold for the proof
Man put it in believing, believe in believing
Seeing ain't believing, it's the feeling that we needing
Believe in each other, put the question to the system
They promising returns? Then question what you getting
We should believe in the reasons we existing
Time for Renaissance to reawaken what is withered
Believe kid, confirm, make it is what it isn't
Sometimes I wish I had belief when I didn't

[D'Angelo]
I believe... that's love
I believe... that's love, that's love

[Q-Tip]
In the land of make-believe, time to make unbelieve believable
Taking belief to the realm of the real
Believing this shit that's force-fed through the media
Believe it is real when it's really a raw deal
Never disbelieve when you see human miracle
Like ghetto children shining bright in Babylon
Believe in that, don't believe in stats to the contrary
Gotta be wary of them theories, carry on
People find belief when they don't find identity
Believe in your friends, don't believe in your enemies
Mountains of doubts and disbelief right in front of you
Troops on the other side, what you gon' do?

[D'Angelo]
Oooh... oooh, oooh, heeey
Ooh that's love, that's love
Oooh... oooh, oooh, heeey
Ooh that's love, that's love
I believe...
I believe...
I believe...</pre>
