Wack itt, wack itt, wack itt...

Now this is called the Wack Itt, and I do it all the time
Choose the wackest, wackest beats, and add the wackest, wackest rhymes
The wacky, wacky, wacky voice, which I really shouldn't say, is wacky
Some people say it's wack, but it's not, it's just cracky
This is how I do it, some people just can't hack it
If it's cold outside, then go on and put on a jacket
But now I'm here to tell you. and we know this for a fact
This record's just like crack, you know what it is? It's wack
Wack itt

I mean you're goin out the whole nine yards

Now I'm sittin in my room tryin to guess just what to do
So I decided to get wacky, cause you know, yo, that's true
So we turned on to a track that had to be super wack
And yo, guess what we came up - somethin like that
I was really thinkin about some things that make me mad
How could you get a gold record when you sound like J.J. Fad?
I mean come on, let's be for real, I mean I didn't wanna say it
But their shit was so wack, yo, this one I know you'll play it
It's record
A wacky record

Now just jump up and down, spin your head from left to right
Then just move a little bit, get real close, but not too tight
Let me see you throw your hands up in the air like you don't care
And that's called the wackest dance, and we'll call it the Underwear
It's a record
A wacky record

(Go on, girl)

Now my name is Shanté, not Wanda Wah-Wah
And I'm here to make a record, and some people say I'm a star
I say: Yeah, I do agree, but you have to think real close
I mean, when it comes to bein wacky, J.J. Fad, yo, they're the most
It's a wack itt

Wack itt, wack itt, wack itt...

Now if you want a example, let me tell you what makes me mad
Did you ever hear Supersonic that was by J.J. Fad?
Listen close to what I'm sayin, cause it went somethin like this
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la...)
Or you can say I missed, I really can't resist
To come to someone, up to their face. and then give them a diss
I do it all the time, everytime I say a rhyme
People jump, yeah, all on mines, cause you know they're out of line
I tell them to step right back, cause you know the record's wack
If you do not like the record, yo - I got it like that
I can make rhymes up just like this
Make the people not wanna resist
They listen to the beat and start to dance
And then they start to jump up in their pants
Now I told you how to do the dance
Get on the floor and take a chance
Now this is known as a matter of fact
Yo, stop the track, let's get wack

Wack
Wack
Wack
Wack

( *as a record is spun backwards* )
Yo yo
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
My ears
What you're doin, baby
Stop playin
Stop
Stop
Stop
My God

Wack itt, wack itt, wack it...
(Bass)

Ah-ha
Wack wack

Now sittin in my room tryin to guess just what to do
So I decided to get wacky, cause you know, yo, that's true
So we turned on to a track that had to be super wack
And yo, guess what we came up - somethin like that

(Bass)

Now get offa my tip
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Now who would believe...
See this - this here happens to be a fad or a faze or a style
That the party people happen to be going through
And I'm in this to win this
And I'm here to get paid, so I figured I might as well get wack too
I mean come on
They might even tell me that the record is
DYNAMITE!!!
Now wasn't that cute
But anyway
Wish I get some respect after this one

Wack itt
Wack itt
Wacky wack itt
Wack itt
Wack itt
