Chorus: [KLC and Mystikal]
Twerk somethin'
Shake somethin'
Twerk somethin'
Shake somethin'
Twerk somethin'
Shake somethin'
Bring that ass over here
Twerk somethin'
Shake somethin'
Twerk somethin'
Shake somethin'
Twerk somethin'
Shake somethin'
Shake that ass over here

[Mystikal]
Oh
You think I can't see you over there shakin' your ass
Watchin' you bouncin' your tities, I almost dropped my glass
I can't be trippin' on a big ol' booty
I'm supposed to be a star
When you see them tanks, you know who we are
You on a mission with your pussy
You after my papers, straight asshole naked on your way to my table
So I played it cool, and tried to act surprised
Knowin' damn well I've been watchin' this bitch from the side of my eye
She looked my in my face and said "Don't I know your name?"
You out the South, y'all bout it, you wanna get entertained?
I said B, I'm not tryin' to be too much, but I'm chillin' tonight
My mouth said no, my dick's sayin' fuckin' right
Man fuck all that shit, I ain't bout to pay this woman to party
Till she turned around, bent over, her pussy hung on my body
Damn, you know what bro, this pussy might be worth somethin'
Go ahead girl, handle your business
Twerk somethin'

Chorus X2

[Mia X]

There's gonna have to be a whole lotta big bills wavin' in the air
To make me shake it work it twerk it, take a nigga there
To the sky, get 'em racked up
Tryin' to have relations, dick at atten-hut
What, what
Whoa now daddy, love to love ya baby
But you know you gotta pay me, prolly got a old lady
And a few rug rats at home to feed
But you tryin' to run that line
What you think, you Gineuwine the bachelor
I'll pass you like you don't exist
And part my ass like the red sea, and tell you to kiss
You be the same nigga known to get your fuckin' mack on
And call the wife, it's so precise, and say you won't be back home
Mama's sunshine all in your face with that southern wine 
Rodeo style till your toes curl and I'll be
Laying in the gap so picture perfect
Now do you really wanna see a bitch twerk it?
