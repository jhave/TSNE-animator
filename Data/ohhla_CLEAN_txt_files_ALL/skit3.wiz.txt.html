It's ya boy Mr. Easy Rider
Coming to you live on W.E.E.D.
And right now we got some Guerrilla pimpin shit
You know we highway pimpin these hoes
That's state to state fool
What chu know bout it?

If you on a highway right now
And a bitch owe you money
I need you to turn this shit up
roll you a nice joint, and check your paper fool

And this shit right here, is my nigga Big K.R.I.T.
Curren$y Tha hot Spitta
