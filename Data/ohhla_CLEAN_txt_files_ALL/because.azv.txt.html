AZ:
It's on for now, niggas ballin' now (uh huh)
It's The Firm baby, ain't no fallin' down
Thorugh your eyes see your snakeness (Uh huh)
No lie, Doe Or Die, try to take this
Stay swift, you can follow if you tailgate (C'mon)
Reminiscin' when a nigga used to sell weight 
Well laced, G.A. in the summertime, Freaknick (C'mon)
Back and forth to the ball game, Hen in the cup (Ah)
Through the years niggas all changed, livin' it up
Takin's steps to the next level, seen the light
What it be like, now, puttin' weed in the pipe

CHORUS: [AZ]
Berakin' day, off this shit here
This year, snatched loot everywhere
Next year, takin' what we left here
A fear, for thugs
Hoes get dug, foes get slugs
Just because
{Repeat Chorus Twice}

AZ:
Cancun at the Jazzfest
First time we ever met you was half dressed
Easy access (Ah)
You and you whole crew, ya alright
When you beep use Code 2, call tonight
Got a villa full of young Dons
Champagne and a grill on my front lawn
What's song?
We can dance to some more jams
Finally meet Nas and the whole fam
Roseland, love is love when it's all good, clutch ya name (yeah.. yeah)
Through my eyes, I'm all hood, fuck the fame
Play a script like Larenz Tate, bench weights (Yeah)
Worked out stay in shape
Benz plates
Cruise around wit the hot sounds
Pumped loud, "I Be" by Fox Brown
It's locked down
Overall tryin' to make moves stay in the mix
Motivated by the ace, deuce, tre and the six

{Repeat Chorus 2 Times}

AZ:
Wanna bring it to me right way
Face to face, (yeah) when you see me get ya lie straight
It's high stakes, (uh huh) goin' up against a street playa, true type 
(uh huh)
Get the paper handle beef later, never too hype
Analyze from the next man, wants war
Still alive, on the next plan, wantin' more
Outta town tryin' to get mine stay in the cut (Uh huh)
Cubans control the prices, keep raisin' 'em up!
Peace and love to my allies (Uh, uh) play on
Stayin' up, high late at nights, stay strong
Sittin' up lettin' all y'all know the deal
This Firm shit is on for real (For real)

{Repeat Chorus 5 Times}</pre>
