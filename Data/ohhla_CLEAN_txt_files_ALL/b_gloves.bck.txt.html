[Young Buck]
Walk through a nigga block
Two glock, two tecs, two two-threes
Give a nigga what he really want
When bitch niggaz don't want beef
Bitch niggaz don't know me
Wait 'til a nigga get in range
Hate when a nigga wanna run his mouth
then, live his life in pain
We ain't even used to this
talkin, where the gunshots at?
Loose lips sink ships
Y'all niggaz didn't even pop back
Oh Lord, I swore
Any motherfucker holla my name
I'm raw, spelled backwards
Dat's what I'm gon' brang
Banks, what a nigga thankin?
We ain't got guns?  No troops?
E'rythang bulletproof
Snipers layin down on the roof
Stash box in the Coupe NI-GGAH
I'm tellin you the truth NI-GGAH
I raise them lil' penny boys
All they do is come shoot niggaz
Black glove, black mask
Black shirt, black pants
Blue steel, blue vest
He dead, you next
Put a couple holes in a ho
Let a nigga know he 'bout to go
Put the pump right to his throat
Bet he won't talk no mo'

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Black glove, black mask
Black shirt, black pants
Blue steel, blue vest
He dead, you next

[Young Buck]
I'm comin, through the front do'
Mask on, let's ride
E'rybody on the motherfuckin flo'
soon as a nigga get inside
My hood, my click
Yo' wife, my bitch
Show a nigga that you really love him
Set him up to hit a good lick
Cops comin, I'm not runnin
If I do die, don't cry
I hadn't planned on stayin long anyway
I ain't gon' lie
Wonder why I still got bricks?
Wonder why I still got clips?
Cause ain't a damn thang changed
ever since Young Buck done got rich
Are you ready for the outcome?
Why you walkin 'round without a gun?
Shit real 'til a nigga get killed
Then you wanna run and get one
Fuck that, I'm callin out names
Ja Rule, y'all loose
I don't even care how it started
Fuck me?  FUCK YOU
Wait 'til Yayo get home
We gon' really get these niggaz gone
But for now a nigga hold on
I'ma show you how to break a bone
Ca$hville, Ten-a-ki' nigga
We thugs, you knew it
New York, we here
fo' life, G-Unit!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yeah!!  Young Buck nigga!
Ca$hville Tennessee nigga
From yo' hood to my hood motherfucker
New York City nigga, ha ha ha
Real shit nigga
It's all good nigga, ha ha ha
It's all hood nigga</pre>
