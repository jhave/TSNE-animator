[Scribe]
Check it out, 1, 2, Hey yo, hey yo

I came a long way since back in the day
From a teenager trying to make a rap in this way
Ever since I was a kid I had something to say
Rocking mics was a dream I didn't care about pay
I sacrificed late nights and going out with my friends
Just to stay home alone with my pad and my pen
Had my eyes on my prize, my mind on my goal
As I carved these rhymes out with my heart and my soul
I didn't have a CD, all I had was a tape
On the dole through my flow was my only escape
From a world where they didn't wanna see me prevail
Didn't wanna see me take it all, they'd rather see me fail
Its like

[Chorus]
I was down and out, struggling
Wondering how I'm gonna make it through
I got a dream, holding on
I can't let go, 'cause I gotta make it come true

[Scribe]
Hey yo, I got a dream to make it big in New York
Give up the drugs and alcohol, I didn't want to distort
My vision to be living life to the full
And I wouldn't of made it if it wasn't for you
You picked me up every time that I fell
When I was going thru hell you told me that I would prevail
You said I had exactly what it took to be great
That I was young and in the future would a man I would make
Its like you saw something in me I couldn't see
You said I would succeed and be anything I wanted to be
I'm 23 and I just wanna be me
Wanna be free, wanna be everything I can be
But I don't have many choices, can't afford to be wrong
All I do is try to stay true to the words of my song
Just don't hesitate and wait too long
Cos like a dream when you wake up it's gone ... it's gone

[Chorus]
[Scribe]
Hey yo, it was a sunny day and we were feeling high
Jamming the song underneath the baby blue sky
Thinking about in the time when we were so poor
Remember the kids used to laugh at the clothes we wore
We always knew one day that things were gonna change
And from that day I was never gonna be the same
I went to sleep that night, I dreamt I touched the sky
And ever since I've been trying to keep my dream alive
So when you see this Scribe, dropping the illest rhyme
To find how I'm living mine in this day and time
I'm working 9 to 5, I'm slaving over beats
It's hard work living the dream, I hardly ever sleep
I'm in the rhythm deep, yo just trying to do my thing
Its funny when you shine and people hate to see the gleam
No matter what they say keep on doing what you do
And don't give up cos only you can make that dream come true
Its like

[Chorus]

I was down and out
Wonder how
I got a dream
I won't let go cos I got</pre>
