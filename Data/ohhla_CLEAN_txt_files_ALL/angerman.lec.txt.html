Song:   Anger Management
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Ay what if....What if we all need anger management?
Huh, Why don't we just...
Treat this song like a...an anger management class
Ya feel me?

I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say
(I don't really care what they say)
I'm angry, nobody better get in my way
(Nobody better get in my way)
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy
I'm fightin, I'm bustin, I'm poppin
I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy
I'm hatin, I'm pushin, I'm shovim
Somebody better get me cause I'm 'bout to do somethim
I'm angry...

Yeah, been up all night, got me feelin weak
No sleep on the first day of a long week
I guess I'm still in school, these people testin me
But disrespectin me I will respond agressively
A long day, short fuse, in the worst mood
My temper red-hot, I will give these boys blues
Hard livin got me feelin very selfish
Crab in a bucket tryin to crush these other shellfish
Forget a chip up off my shoulder man I carry boulders
I don't know how to control them when they get to rollim
If people pop off at the mouth I try to keep cool
All I wanna do is fix it, troubleshooter
Yeah it sounds wrong, if this carries on
The faith I claim to have, I probably never owned
Empty waiting room, running out of patience
This is anger management? Give me another agent

I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say
(I don't really care what they say)
I'm angry, nobody better get in my way
(Nobody better get in my way)
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy
I'm fightin, I'm bustin, I'm poppin
I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy
I'm hatin, I'm pushin, I'm shovim
Somebody better get me cause I'm 'bout to do somethim
I'm angry...

I'm angry every mornin befo' I get up out the bed
This dog keep on barkin I'ma bust him in the head
Uncle keep on trippin if he want to he can get it too
Anybody say another word I'ma act a fool
I hit the door, brush my fitted to the side
Heart full of pride, anger in my eyes
Been this way since the day I seen my homie die
Now I'm mad at the world and I hate that I'm alive
Really hate to say it cause it's killin me inside
All I wanna be is loved and it's eatin me alive
Don't nobody love me man, my momma and my daddy gone
Uncle ain't my uncle cause I'm livin in a foster home
I say I'm saved but I'm scared of the truth
'Cause I read Galatians 5 and I did see the fruit
I don't know what else to do, I don't know what else to say
So I hit my knees and pray, "God take this thing away"

I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say
(I don't really care what they say)
I'm angry, nobody better get in my way
(Nobody better get in my way)
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy
I'm fightin, I'm bustin, I'm poppin
I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy
I'm hatin, I'm pushin, I'm shovim
Somebody better get me cause I'm 'bout to do somethim
I'm angry...

Would die for my respect but, I got no humility
And Jesus paid my debt while I reject him willingly
And man I got some nerve, holdin anger in my heart
The Father coulda come serve me that beef up A La Carte
Not to mention torture Jesus took for my misfortune
I been freed from the law, but I'm servin these court orders
Unforgiveness is my pedigree, you say you sorry, better be
Better bein mad at you, than tryin to be a better me
Ain't nothin in my workin tryna' demonstrate his worth
And though he show me plenty grace, I don't extend the other verses
And that anger led to murder, when you pull up on the murder scene
It's Jesus nailed upon that cross, yeah the murderer was me
1st Peter 2:23 man,
When they used to hurl insults at Jesus, he didn't retaliate
He entrusted himself to the one that judges justly
The gospel manages our anger, ya feel me?
The solution is to gain a heart that's thankful for grace in Jesus Christ!

I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say
(I don't really care what they say)
I'm angry, nobody better get in my way
(Nobody better get in my way)
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy
I'm fightin, I'm bustin, I'm poppin
I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me
I'm angry Ayyy, ayyy, ayyy, ayyy
I'm hatin, I'm pushin, I'm shovim
Somebody better get me cause I'm 'bout to do somethim
I'm angry...</pre>
