[Intro: female singing] (Yo Gotti) {Lil Wayne}
Women lie, men lie 
Women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie 
Numbers don't lie  (Heh, I'M YO GOTTI~!)
Women lie, men lie 
Women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie 
Numbers don't lie   {YOUNG MONEY!}
Women lie, men lie 
Women lie, men lie  (Ay, all I see/C is notes)
Women lie, men lie  {Yeah!} 
Numbers don't lie
Women lie, men lie  (16, 16.5, 17, 18...)
Women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie 
Numbers don't lie 
Women lie, men lie  (Ay Chris, you'll need the money machine for this one...)
Women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie 
Numbers don't lie
Women lie, men lie  
Women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie 
Numbers don't lie

[Yo Gotti - Verse 1ne]
Ay, step up in the party and dem bad bitches be on me
I be sippin on Patron when I'm jumpin out Ferrari's (WOO!)
I be rockin Gucci, sometimes Louis, I'm retarded
And the rims by Asanti, but the shades by Bulgari (WOO!)
Hand on my scrap, I got my mind on my money
Plus if my mind on dine, he ain't takin nothin from me
Headed on this choppa tool, headed on this choppa tool
Got headed on a hunderd round 'cause that's how much the choppa shoot
Ball-ballin is my hobby, countin hundreds, goin shoppin
And a 5 star wit me and I met her in the lobby
Took her to the room, she hit me with that line
Said she ain't that type of girl, so I told her stop lyin

[Chorus: female singing]
Women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie
Numbers don't lie
Women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie
Numbers don't lie  (But them, but them numbers don't lie!)
Women lie, men lie (But them, but them numbers don't lie!)
Women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie (Them num-them num-them numbers don't lie!)
Numbers don't lie
Women lie, men lie (Don't lie! Don't lie!)
Women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie (Don't lie! Don't lie!)
Numbers don't lie


[Lil Wayne - Verse 2wo]
YOUNG MONEY~! YEAAH!!
Okay, I ain't gotta lie, cross my heart, hope to die 
Them numbers don't lie, G5 over sky 
I fucked her pussy good, make her cry if I tried 
But I'm tired of bein sick, and I'm sick of bein tired 
Tired of these niggaz, and tired of these bitchez 
And shit, let 'em lie, long as they ain't snitchin, ha ha! 
And men lie about women 
and shit... women lie about plenty 
{Women lie, men lie} And they ain't lyin on me 
I'm in the bed with two fine bitches lyin on me 
so that would make three, and numbers don't LIE
and money don't LIE, and neither do I, bitch!
{*overlaps chorus*} ..'cause I'm the truth
Yah, now what are you? Ha ha!

[Chorus]

[Yo Gotti - Verse 3hree]
I'm tryna count to, a, billion
My bitch, Brazillian 
Hop in that Lamb', push the button, lose the ceiling 
Sun out, no rain drops, postin the same, spot 
Right here in North, North Memphis where I came from 
Hundred on the neck, I ain't never had shit 
That the streets gave me family, Barry White cut the check 
Ain't no secret in the streets, niggaz know I got neck 
Got the swagger through the roof, I was born just to flex (Yo Gotti!) 
Zip code on my wrist, phone number in the bank 
In my ten 'til six with my 305 paint 
I got my 3-5-7 and my 501's 
in a Lear 55 wit my Air Force Ones - NO LIE

[Outro]
Women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie
Numbers don't lie (Ay, this ya boy Yo Gotti~!)
Women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie
Say whatchu want but the fucka don't lie</pre>
