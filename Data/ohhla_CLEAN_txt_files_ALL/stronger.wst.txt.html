[Chorus]
Na-na-now ta-that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waitin' all night now
That's how long I been on ya
I need you right now
I need you right now

[Verse 1]
Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian and and Christian Dior
Damn they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, cause I'm not sure, do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'Cause right now thou has forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead go nuts go Ape shit
Specially on my pastel on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New gospel homey take six, and take this haters

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Me likey
I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
God put me in the plans or not
I'm trippin, this drink got me sayin a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me
There's a thousand yous there's only one of me
I'm trippin, I'm caught up in the moment, right?
'Casue is Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a klondike
well I'd do anything for a blonde dike
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And will do anything when the time's right
UH, baby you're makin' it - harder, better, faster, stronger

[Chorus]

You know how long I've been on ya?
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Baby you're making it - harder, better, faster, stronger

[Chorus]
You know how long I've been on ya?
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya
You know how long I've been on ya?
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya</pre>
