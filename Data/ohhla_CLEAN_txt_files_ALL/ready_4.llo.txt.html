(*talking*) 
Ooh these boys hating, don't think I don't peep it 
It's alright though, I'm ready I'm telling ya 

[Chorus: Wonderous] 
You better know, when I'm up in the club 
That I'm ready for whatever, I'm a G so what's up 
Just because you see me out there shining, doing my thang 
Don't think a player won't switch, and get to throwing them thangs 
Get to throwing them hands 

[Wonderous] 
Hey look I'm ready for whatever, I'm ready for whatever 
I'm ready for whatever, come on get up on my level 
Hey look I'm ready for whatever, I'm ready for whatever 
I'm ready for whatever, come on get up on my level 

[Lil' O] 
I'm Fat Rat, with the Cheese 
I'm the one, hater please 
In fact bow, on your knees 
I been getting money, since 9-3 
Triple O.G., I don't gotta talk to you boys 
Make a hole, 'fore I come through and walk through you boys 
I'll put a spark, through you boys 
This old dog bite, I won't bark at you boys 
I look good, I feel good 
I talk like Barack, but I'm real hood 
I check a hater, any player that's trill would 
If the hands or shank don't work, then a steal should 

[Wonderous] 
Hey look I'm ready for whatever, I'm ready for whatever 
I'm ready for whatever, come on get up on my level 
Hey look I'm ready for whatever, I'm ready for whatever 
I'm ready for whatever, come on get up on my level 

[Chorus] 

[Lil' O] 
You think, I gotta loc's to be cool 
Dang fool, I done stoked out the room 
You don't know, I done plotted out your doom 
If you wanna phone me, it's clean sweep like a broom 
See I know, I got two bottles over there 
And I see, I got my hood over there 
And why you think, I'm standing close to these chairs 
Lil' daddy I'm gutter, and I don't fight fair 
I see you, checking out my Gucci 'fit 
And I know you seen me balling, with my booshie bitch 
But what you really don't know, is I'll bruise you quick 
Better answer right, when my dogs asking who you with 

[Wonderous] 
Hey look I'm ready for whatever, I'm ready for whatever 
I'm ready for whatever, come on get up on my level 
Hey look I'm ready for whatever, I'm ready for whatever 
I'm ready for whatever, come on get up on my level 

[Chorus] 

[Lil' O] 
A hater there, a hater there 
I should buy em fuck me shirts, and call it hater wear 
But ask me, do a player care 
Why would I when they gal, whispering in a player ear 
And she talking bout, doing some'ing 
She like you, ya always talking bout doing some'ing 
The only difference is she for real, you ya bumping 
I'ma really take her to the room, and ruin some'ing 
You won't get me stressed 
We will tear this club up, and make a motherfucking mess 
I want a hundred, nothing less 
Now go on bout your bidness lil' daddy, God bless 

[Wonderous] 
Hey look I'm ready for whatever, I'm ready for whatever 
I'm ready for whatever, come on get up on my level 
Hey look I'm ready for whatever, I'm ready for whatever 
I'm ready for whatever, come on get up on my level 

[Chorus]</pre>
