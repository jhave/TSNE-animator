[Celph Titled talking]
Stupid motherfuckers. Run, duck, and hide, die motherfucker die.
(Let em know, Celph) It's time to bust some heads in. (Let's go.) Oh yeah.
It is the Army. Blaaaat!

[Chorus] [Celph Titled]
Hard to the motherfucking core we are
The federated army of the Pharaoh murderer squad
Run run
We gonna tear the head piece up
Uh huh, you don't want beef because

Vinnie I had enough of them, yo bust 'em in
Vinnie I had enough of them, yo bust 'em in
Bust bust 'em in
Bust bust 'em in
Bust bust 'em in
Bust bust 'em in

[Verse One] [Reef The Lost Cauze]
A.O.T.P.
Fresh Nikes and ice links
You won't feel till after the punch like a spiked drink
Sipping Goose till my eyes pink
Ninety-five live rings
Real niggas survive things and die kings
I can hear dead homie sayin' "Yo you owe it to me."
So it's no holds barred like the old Hulk Hogan movie
You got a heart homeboy? Well yo show it to me
The flow's majestic, I spit a roll of golden rubies
I'm old school like roll a doobie
Daddy-O my hoes is groovy, pay my rent with dough from groupies
A pimp and a killer, gorilla your project
Nine milli really only defense of my logic
The shotgun just sits in the closet
Waiting for you fuckers to come dip in my shit
Nonsense
The weak could never stop the thorough
Bitch niggas suspect, I call them boys Gossip Girls

[Chorus] [Celph Titled]
Hard to the motherfucking core we are
The federated army of the Pharaoh murderer squad
Run run
We gonna tear the head piece up
Uh huh, you don't want beef because

Vinnie I had enough of them, yo bust 'em in
Vinnie I had enough of them, yo bust 'em in
Bust bust 'em in
Bust bust 'em in
Bust bust 'em in
Bust bust 'em in

[Verse Two] [Apathy]
I treat fools like bitches cause I always got a few biscuits
And bus(t) 'em in like kids from different school districts
Y'all dip shits will get your spinal discs flipped
Rhymes will make the vinyl disc skip, find your wrists slit
Nickel-plated nine shine like diamonds on Slick Rick
I'm wicked as a Wiccan bitch when the candle wick's lit
Want to sample this shit? You need to read Sanskrit
And travel to the top of Mount Sinai to transmit
Running through the Red Seas like an escaped slave
Then holding up the walls of water with my sound waves
Like what I was doing during Public Execution
Half-human, half-mutant, Ap must be the Rasputin
Gats shooting, shots ricocheting off of my steel body
And three quarter length Fat Goose to conceal shotties
If God walks the surface of the sun it won't melt feet
Cause when's the last time you heard Ap rip a Celph beat?

[Chorus] [Celph Titled]
Hard to the motherfucking core we are
The federated army of the Pharaoh murderer squad
Run run
We gonna tear the head piece up
Uh huh, you don't want beef because

Vinnie I had enough of them, yo bust 'em in
Vinnie I had enough of them, yo bust 'em in
Bust bust 'em in
Bust bust 'em in
Bust bust 'em in
Bust bust 'em in

[Verse Three] [Celph Titled]
I'm a five-star general, the motherfucking main man
Flip a bird, hold a swammy with the same hand
And do a rain dance when blood splatters and sprays
Cement mixing your IV, turn your Anatomy Grey
Nobody ratted at A-
O.T.P. not Tretch with O.P.P.
I'm obsessed with O.C.D.
A temperamental mental patient
With cyberkenetic on-board computer integration
One of rap's most innovative voices and flows
In front of missile-command buttons
I look around, all my choices just blow
So now you should know 
I'm the don of braggadocio flamethrower
I'm Cobra Kai and I'm keeping that dojo, name goers
Come down and sign up, I'm training soldiers to rhyme rough
And get they punchlines up
Cause you ain't fucking with the gold beard Rubix Cuban nowhere
No rapper is nowhere near what I just wrote here 
Oh yeah 

[Outro] [Vinnie Paz]
Yeah. A.O.T.P. Pharaoh clique. Philly to Beantown
To Connecticut. To fuckin' Tampa. We worldwide baby
Official pistol gang. Braaaat!</pre>
