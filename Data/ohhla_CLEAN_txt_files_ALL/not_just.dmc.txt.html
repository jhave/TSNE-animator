[Jay]
One two, one two, and I say
I go by the name of Jam Master Jay
And the Hollis Crew, we here to stay believe that

[D.M.C.]
Hey, as we let the music play
Pay attention and listen as I mention
a recital of mic to speeches
From the book of the 40 Ounces
of the most powerful words ever spoken

[Run]
Topsy-turvy, they try to serve me
Disturb me, curve me, boy they never heard me
Slammin, jammin, I be bammin
Makin takin breakin and rammin
Run got a beef with those that cold think that
Sun and the moon and soon you will drink that
wine for the rhyme that I'm, not a stink brat
Run havin fun my son, just where the ink's at
Up on the top I pop and drop, you feel
So low you go for Joe you know, what the deal
I might just strike tonight, and make you say
(Run ran the place with bass and bust boo-tay)
Go check the clock I rock your jock so hard
Make you feel the deal is I'm top card
Come in my face and bass and I might just
And it's not n-n-not, n-n-not JUST ANOTHER GROOVE

	Not just another..

[Jay]
Ah yeah, one two one two Jam Master Jay
Hollis Crew here to stay, AUGGHH!
Afros, 40 Ounce Crew in effect, word up
Bout to break ya neck with another groove
Kick it D

[D.M.C.]
Check out the lyric, hear it, cheer it, fear it
So loud and clear that you can't come near it
Words are heard, I never speak the weak
You pissed me off, now I'm takin a leak
I kill at will, thrill, top bill
I'm makin a mill, and damn I'm still
makin history on the M-I-C
And for the young ladies, a nigga like D'll
be waxin taxin no relaxin breakin backs
and bustin raps and I'll be strapped
in my Cadillac, and you know that for a fact
I'm strapped with rap but yo, I'm also
record breakin never flakin wide awake
and titles I'm takin and I'll be makin
ladies groove cause I prove I can soothe when they
OOOOOH, this one's called - NOT JUST ANOTHER GROOVE

	Not just another..
	Not just another..

(Not just another one, not just another one)

[Jay]
Deliverin, I'll deliver and give ya
whatcha been waitin (one two three) for/four
This, is the gift of the gab
that I had when I came out the lab
The masterpiece was released
Let's cease the beef and all those misbeliefs
that we can't do our thing on a positive tip
I'm tryin to tell ya
It's been a long time -- we need a change
Time for things to be rearranged
Time to get our act together
Whoever's clever or better - never let
another brother or sister get dissed cause they missed the
knowledge and wisdom and damn I wish ya
get with the Stop the Violence move
Won'tcha hear me say peace, and it's not just another groove

[D.M.C.]
Yeah Jay I just wanna say whassup to the brothers and sisters out there
(Yeah.. it's not just another groove)
