[Intro - Man - talking] (*echo*)
Would you have done it?
Would you follow God's instructions for your life?
Would you take these promises out of the Bible?
You see these promises aren't just for me
And preachers and pastors and everybody else
They're for all of us

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Our Father who art in heaven
Baptize my soul and help me learn my lessons
I'm tryin to do right and return the blessing
But please don't judge me on a first impression
I don't go to Mass, don't mean I ain't religious (nah)
Still get the picture, even though I skip the scriptures
As a young kid, yeah did a little mischief
Most I do now though is get a little lifted
Used to go to church every Sunday (yeah, yeah)
But since I moved out my parents' house, I ain't gone one day
I don't know why, I feel God inside
I know I'll see him soon, time's up when I die (come on)
I know my Ten Commandments, I take it very serious
I still got my rosary and I'll be buried wearin it (yeah)
Know death happens but fuck it, I'm still fearin it
When all said is done, I don't know if I'm prepared for it
This can't be it, the wicked ones always prosper
But after we depart, we'll be judged by our Father
Life is a trial and we're sentenced when it's passed
So forgive us for our sins and the greedy things we've asked

[Chorus - Classified] (White Mic)
Now this is what it comes down to
(Just let me die in peace with my beliefs)
Follow what you want, not what they allow you
(Thank the Lord but don't know what I'm thankful for)
Said this is what it comes down to
(For the faithless because their God is faceless)
And everybody got an opinion around you
(But shh, quiet please, these my beliefs)

[Verse 2 - Jay Bizzy]
Yeah, Hail Mary, full of grace
When I die, pray to God I get to see your face
Please forgive me for my sins, all my greed, my hate
All the bad shit I done that can't be erased
So many lost souls, all they really need is faith
Maybe I can be their shepherd, help to see them straight
Wait, I ain't preachin to ya, at least I'm not tryin
So many sufferin wonderin why we all dyin
It ain't for us to understand God's master plan
I work hard, do the best I can
And I know the Lord's watchin on me, yeah he walks with me
Don't go to church but I talk to him often, Je-
sus, got my back, now who's fuckin with that?
I pray to God when I'm bumpin a track
Please deliver us from evil, 'cause we all God's children
Just like hip-hop on the radio, I can't see Him but I still feel Him

[Chorus]

[Break - Man - talking] (J-Bru) (*echo*)
Give us the strength Father just to step out and praise in positive belief
(See this through my eyes)
Help us to understand that with you we can do it
Without you, it's impossible

[Verse 3 - J-Bru]
There's people like me out there but we get neglected
'Cause people think you don't believe in God, you ain't protected
What about these kids that believe and they still die? They got AIDS, cancer
Tell me this don't matter
You think it's God's plan to keep me alive? when I don't believe in him?
My lungs don't breathe with him?
(My heart don't beat with him) but shit it's still beatin
Kids starvin everyday and Bru's still eatin
Are we present? Naw, I can't believe it
Nobody can be everywhere at once, I can't see it
I can't be it, by "it", I mean God with
Cults up in the church prayin, yo I ain't carin
Y'all can pray along all you want but think about it
Innocent people dyin everywhere, I can't be about it
Fuck thinkin that He takes you when He wants to
If He listen to this, strike me down, do what God do

[Chorus]

[Outro - Preacher K - talking]
My beliefs, whether interlocked or independent
Expose the real me, the poet, the legend
My pops, he installed lots of thoughts
Every Sunday to the church, we walked
I'm so sensitive to humanity crisis
I want to start a charity to vanish and wipe it
Instead of arguing and yelling at my fellow man
We need to agree to disagree, understand? (*echo*)</pre>
