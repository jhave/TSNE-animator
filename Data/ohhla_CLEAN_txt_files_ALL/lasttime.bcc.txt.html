[Intro]

Turn on the faucet...mm-hmm
Uh-huh (x5)
You and you throw your hands up
If you in the back come on, throw your hands up
If you in the front, you can throw your hands up
If you on the side, you can throw your hands up
Wave 'em in the sky, you can throw your hands up
Yo its aiight if you wanna throw your hands up
You and you and you could throw your hands up
Cause its the B-double-ooh
B-double-oh, this is how we do
On the regular oh-ooh, you know who
Uh-huh (x3)

[Buckshot]

Yo there used to be a rumor about BDI
I wouldnt come back, I tell you no lie
But when I listen to the radio I think
Whenever I'm back, I'm bound to make a link
With the music that used to make me jam and jump
Thump while the bass bump
Tellin BJ throw on the wax thats playin the Therapy mix
You said it was aiight, we made a remix
Licks after licks take ticks
Of the time clock
B-D-Buck a shot, uh, take it to the top
See I'm bound to make your body pop
One nation under a groove, so my beat'll never stop
When I heard about the beef between the East and the West coast
Called my nigga Kurupt, I knew it was boast
They hope a nigga in the music with this bomb
So I prepare load my arms
And wait, cause its the last time

Chorus [F.L.O.W.]

This is the last time i will
Ever struggle
This is the last time i will
Ever fall

[BJ Swan]

My moms gotta take in second-hand bum smoke 
Just to keep from breakin, goin broke
And if you read my diary it'd break your heart
Cause I been losin like a mutherfucka from the start
Excuse me--but thats the only way that I can express
My life feelin like a bunch of bullets racin through my chest
Time after time i felt the feelin that you feel when you lose
Sittin on my stoop cryin blues
Seekin refuge from these hard-time skits
Remembering days when I was literally penniless
And have to watch my people do it alone
I said it was the last time but this time I swear
I'll make it happen if I have to to lose all my hair 
For real

Chorus (x2)

[Steele]

Eyes watch as I make moves
Livin proof that the struggle still continues
Who's out to gain for fame?
Let him not remain vain
Time will tell who fell
And who maintained
Finding my purpose in this life
Cause I aint sure that we all promised paradise
Precisely I'm just like the seed
Planted in the Earth to bring forth new breed
Shall I proceed to manifest destiny
Surely me and all of my B and C
Will find our time on the line of history
Faithfully as G-O-D watchin over we
Created we so I satnd in my God Body
Hardly moved by those crews that try to charge me falsely
It won't be the first time and it won't be the last time 
I'm sure

[F.L.O.W.]

No more strugglin
No more pain
Only good times after this
I pray  
(repeats until end)

Chorus (repeats until end)

All you gotta do is believe in me...</pre>
