[Trina]
Get involved with a nigga
Slob on a nigga
Take all his dough and then I dodge a nigga
Cuz I'm a nasty bitch, I leave a nigga dead broke
Snatch ya bread and cop a brand new coat
I'm da jazzy type
And I'll only let you eat it if you ask me right
My coochie mad tight
Well more juice than a grape when you peel the skin
But yo ain't no fun if your tongue ain't in
WHOO now this is where the madness start
So nigga fuck me with your tongue til ya lick my heart
I gotta body like a coke bottle watch me walk
So nigga work your mouth and don't talk
OK

Chorus: (Money Mark &amp; Trina)

Roll like yay
Must say
I dont sweat
No tired ass nigga I sign my own checks
I'm the Diamond Princess duthces of all broads
Pussy stay tighter and wetter that all ya'lls

You nasty bitch you nasty (Uh huh)
You nasty bitch you nasty (UUUH huh)
You nasty bitch you nasty (What)
Trina you so nasty
You nasty bitch you nasty (Uh huh)
You nasty bitch you nasty (UUUH huh)
You nasty bitch you nasty (What)
Trina why you so dirty

[Trina]
Uh! Phat back wit a real slim waist (What's wrong)
Cant talk with a pussy in ya face then
ULULULUL Keep me sprung with the tongue like
ULULULUL Make me cum til Im numb
Oh Yes! Rub my chest
Make me wet
Doggy style and do it just like that
And lick the sweat it taste just so sweet
When I pop my cock and make ya drop to da beat like
DU DU DU Nasty Bitch
Make a nigga sell his dick just to buy me shit
And just to keep me lookin raw in all da finer shit
And if you wit me girlfriends the shake ya hine to dis
OK

Neva back up fuck game long and strong
Coochie so good break up happy homes
