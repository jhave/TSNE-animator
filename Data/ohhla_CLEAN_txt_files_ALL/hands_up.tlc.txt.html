Rollin' to the club
Stop to get my grub on
Nothin' like those Krispy Kremes
Soon as I was done
It was time to get my groove on
Find a place that's happenin'
And I knew that it was on

From the moment that I walked into the spot
It was bangin'
It was swangin' oh
Till somethin' turned me off
I wasn't sure
Coulda swore I saw you with someone
And at much to my surprise (whoa)

[Chorus]
You were right there with your hands up in the air
You had hoochies everywhere
All on you
It's like I almost didn't know you
Tryin' to shake that ass
Playa you don't even dance
Sup wit' you
It's like I don't even know you

Left you at the crib
Cause I know you get your game on
Happens every Tuesday night
You said that you was cool
Your boys was comin' by
(Go baby have yourself a real good time)
So I knew I could be wrong

I was thinkin' there's no way it could be you
Not my baby
He ain't crazy no
Then my girlfriends tipped me off
When I got closer I could tell that it was you
You was bangin'
You was swangin' oh

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Mindin' my own business
My pager's goin' off
My girlfriends tryin' to tell me
You're doin' wrong
I needed confirmation
I knew you was a dog
I just can't believe what I saw

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
