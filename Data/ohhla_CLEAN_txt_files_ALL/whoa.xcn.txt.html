Hook:
Shake it, pop it, bounce it, twist it (4x)

Chorus:
Whoa lil mama
I can't believe this
Whoa lil mama
My bank you tryna receive this
Whoa lil mama
You gotta twerk
Whoa lil mama
I mean work it (2x)

Look, la-la-look I'm in the club 
But before I spend a dub
You gotta bring it here drop it down and pop it up
Open it hold it there let see that there
I don't care where you shake it just don't drip it in my cup
Now hold up you too fast
You gotta touch your toes lil mama shake that ass!
Wanna back up view a close up for that shot
Five dollars will get you a tabletop
But it won't stop drop to your ankles
And do some tricks to make a nigga wanna spend this bank roll
Head to the bar to cop a bottle now I'm faded 
I'm a big balla now I know yall niggas sho hate it

Chorus 

Na-na-na-now daddy like the way that you be shaking your butt
Opening up I guess it's time to get in the gut
Keep talking it girl but money ain't thang like your main
Don't you see that blang blang in my chain or in my watch
I'm straining I'm hot main like 97 octane
Twenty dollars for five dollar baby
Cuz I'm flossing a hundred g'z in a year
Whoa lil mama vip's rite chea

Hook

Shake it, pop it, flip it, bounce it lil mama (whew!!)
Make a nigga wanna dick bend ya ass over
Flex your pussy muscles
Girl you want these hundred g'z
Girl you got ta hustle
Bounce your ass up and down like that
I like that!
Put your titties in my face so a nigga can bite that
Turn around to that back and let me get a lap dance
Lil mama you got me about to bust a nut in my pants
All that teasin your boy I ain't with that there
After the club you gotta let a nigga hit that there
Here go with B
Tell your boss man you gotta leave the club early 
Ya heard me cuz tonight you finna get your knees dirty (whoa!)
