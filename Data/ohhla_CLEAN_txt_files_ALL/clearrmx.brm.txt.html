Trust mi tell oonu every time we a shine, we design, now mi find

Cock mi nine and watch a bwoy get dropped
Mi seh yuh must be a fool, oonu fi know when fi cool
Whenever mi release tool one a dem start flop
Nuh matta how dem a talk, whenever di gun spark
Betta know in di dark di infrared caan stop
Everybody know that I gotta come and bring it back 
Hit them inn the head with another classic while I kill the track
Pull up in a Lamborghini black (*BULLET!!!!) Selecta bring it back
People packed up inside of the place watch how the streets react
See them ach when I pull out and cock it you don't wanna compete with that
See the fact is that I'll get it poppin like we in Iraq
Plenty ratchets in my whip while I ride like a diplomat

Cau when we step inna di place yuh know seh dat di dance dun!
Ok! Let's go!
