Life 
Ooooh, yeeeeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Dre 3000]
Yeah yeah uh
Been always told to keep my head up
But three shakes just don't cut the cake when your necktie from bobbing
Life's a stage, street's the cage, 
we dungeon rats Outkast and Goodie Mobbin
Enough of the petite talk, I'd rather have a nigga with a perm
Ain't got to have punk, on my side than a nigga who frontin
To another nigga's interpretation of god-stuntin
My growth, why both a president'll be a swat guy
That's like choosing which bullet you gon' get shot by
A drank and some hot fries
Slowly eating me up from inside to outside
Well you gon' die anyway, right?  Wrong
I plan to live forever, I know it seems mighty long
If you think about it in Earth terms
Thank god we on the TV what we let like earthworms
Stay underground like Cheers or Dig Dug
Only come above to shake hands and give hugs
Lay your beautiful body down on this fur rug
You got to give a damn if you do not give a fuck, ha!
Rack 'em up 'cuz we bustin'
Once was the nigga in the back of the class who never said nothing
His thought became an amplifier
I live for inspiration, for without that, I will die (go!)

Jitterbug jam now can you dig it?  
Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it
Jitterbug jam now can you dig it?  
Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it
Jitterbug jam now can you dig it?

[Slim Cutta-Calhoun]
Got issues on my mind like a fool from Columbine
Will I swallow my pride or take that ride?
Better think before my cock get slide and take a dive
Into this hot pit like oil and grits
Stand alone on my own ten toes against foes
It's a snowstorm and you outside gettin' cold
Luck has struck one buck for seven every roll
Throwin' snake eyes thinkin' a nigga gon' fold
Stand down like four black vogues on golds
Snatchin' all the dough and leavin' y'all broke
Going all out for an A plus in class
I bust ass walkin' barefoot over broken glass
Now who gon' pass player?  You won't last
See we all in the race just taking up space
If we's on the other side of the track grab the straps
Thought y'all knew wild dogs run in packs
So who you think you foolin?  We can get to dueling
On some old school shit, like we high schoolin'

<bell rings="">

There he is!

Get him!

(Don't run!  Don't run!)

Yeah, sucker!  What'cha gon' do now?  What'cha gon' do now sucker?

Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it
Jitterbug jam now can you dig it?  
Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it
Jitterbug jam now can you dig it?

[Big Boi]
Let me walk you little kiddies through my school days
Sunday night I hit a party, missed a Monday, I'll go Tuesday
Doomsday, homeroom was lookin' beauty
The girl I wanna cut is absent but I see a cutie
But bump a flirt, I need to be doin' this homework to graduate
Saturate my body and memory on some algebrate
Bro, why you holdin' and totin' that's to assassinate
Go masturbate you jack-off, nigga take the hat off
I'm a third year freshman, I started with the best of them
But now them niggas done passed me, I'm just a baby daddy
O.G. Original Goofball, and I used to slang the hard heart
And smoke the soft softball saw through the way-hall
Niggas up in the school, they know my name, look!
But that's because my face is in like eight different yearbooks
Could've been took the S.A.T. but the streets got the best of me
Thinkin' and drinkin' and bankin' open while like sesame
All tellin' me to chill out (chill out!) 
before you be a drop out (chill out!)
Or cop out, is when you're thirty-something at your mom's house, yeah

Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it
Jitterbug jam now can you dig it?
