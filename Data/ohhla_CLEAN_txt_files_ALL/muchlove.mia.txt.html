Yo, this for all the thugs out there
Hustlin, strugglin
Even with them 9 to 5
I gotta let you know that
Somebody loves you baby
I know I love mine
I think back to shit that happened

Now when we first met, my people really wasn't
Down for seeing me with a nigga who was thuggin
They told me you was trouble and wouldn't amount to shit
They said you'd hold me back
And give me plenty kids
They didn't even want to try and get to know you better
my dad was like hell no
And moms was like whatever
But never in my life have I felt this way
And I know that this is right no matter what they say
Even though you on the grime
Tryin to turn a dime into a dollar
You never to busy to holler
Askin bout my day my needs my feelings
Man enough to tell me what we got is realing
Toughing up my game, preparing me for these streets
Cause every brother don't treat every sister like a queen
You visualize my dreams and speak from your heart
Much love to my thug
boo I hope we never part
Lets make it last forever

Chorus

Through thick and thin and up and down
You have shown me love
So I'm gone be right by your side
Got much love for my thug

I remember when we got our very first little place
Not much furniture, but still we had each other
It was dead smack in the middle of the hood
But it was all good
Cause we be livin large once we could
But for now we was barely seeing pennies
I was waitin tables
And you was on the corner wild with them 20's
The land of plenty seemed so far away
But your bus rides and flights
Put it closer in eyesight
Long nights of cookin, cuttin and baggin
Kept your nerves bad and your eyes red and saggin
Staggerin in the door drunk
Pushin my accusations about them hoes
Time to flaunt
I was sure you was messing around
We start to fight
Even though I was wrong
You loved it when I stood my ground strong
That's why you kept me on your arm on your way up
My thug had me tight in his corner I got much love

Chorus

Now, here we are plush cribs and cars
You hold the title of the newest ghetto star
You gotta watch you back
Cause them niggaz out to jack
And you gotta guard my tracks
Cause them niggaz kidnap
You even made me pack a baby nine in my purse
Took me to the shootin range
How to aim and where to hurt
Make they families feel the worse
Cause loosing me your biggest fears
You said you wasn't even trying to shed those tears
So now I here that your having your flings
I just laugh cause them broads will never wear my rings
Have my things and
Most of all have your heart
We got the strongest ghetto love that will never part
So, when you fell I stood by your side
Took a stand in line
Never let them break me
Though they tried
Cause through it all I'll be by you thug
Real for you thug
Even kill for you thug
Much love
