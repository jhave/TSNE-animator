[Lil Wayne]
Turn the music up...
They say baby how you do it, never question greatness
Never question greatness, tell 'em never question greatness
I just do it.. I'm so high I feel weightless
All my shooters are courageous, and

[Chorus One: Lil Wayne]
Ain't a moment 'til I make it; it ain't a moment 'til I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately.. all I've been doin' is celebratin'
Don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' natethin'
They got niggas catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save ya

[Lil Wayne]
Know you see me in that Rolls Royce, glass house, that nigga, hands down
No givin' up, no layin' down, all red, ant pile
My oldest son just turned five, I said "Lil nigga, you a man now"
Ride around with that strap out cause that Rolls Royce, glass house
I just got a text that said "Baby I just cashed out"
Whack weed get ashed out, put Persian rugs in the crackhouse
All y'all that lashed out, I'll come see what that's 'bout
But you don't need to call the fireman, to put a mothafuckin' match out
I can't remember my last +Drought+, all my niggas' smash mouth
Got pure coke, brand new birds, we get 'em as soon as they hatch, slime
And you know the driveway too big when you ain't gotta back out
Paper chase like cat mouse, my nigga it..

[Chorus One]

[Lil Wayne]
Know you see me cause my roof all in my trunk, know he dead when the horn honk
Niggas say they kings, they lyin', boy you talkin' to a card shark
I already made my mark, please don't think I just pop corks
Got these voices in my head screamin', can't believe they're not hoarse
Bitch I've been a beast since cartoon sheets
It's real on the field, I need new cleats, outgrew these
Catch you while you sleep, turn your sheets to maroon sheets
Them choppers turn your homeboys into amputees
And that's not a good look; momma was a chef
but daddy cooked the work, said "I know it stank but it's good"
Look, we treat them triggers like repeat buttons, leave it all out there, or leave nothin'
Like the world a crystal ball, I keep rubbin' it..

[Chorus One]

[Lil Wayne]
Can't nobody save ya, yeah
New Orleans pride and savior, yeah
Nigga this that "Carter 5"
I feel like, feel like I'm on my final caper
Uh, and I'm about to smoke one, pass out, OG kush, hashed out
She only want alcohol and trees, fuck that, you gotta branch out
I camp out by a rat house, wait 'til he turn the lamp out
Still drownin' in the fuckin' money, y'all niggas look like y'all swam out
In this bitch, gats out in this bitch
She say she can come and help my fat wallet get fit
I told her that's not in this script, I don't see that in the script
I'm smokin', gettin' head, lookin' down tryna read lips

[Chorus Two: Lil Wayne]
Ain't a moment 'til I make it; it ain't a moment 'til I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately.. all I've been doin' is celebratin'
Don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' natethin'
Niggas out'chea catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
Shoot it if I wave; I told myself...

[Chorus One] - to fade</pre>
