V1
My fault or is it yours, hardly kick it any more
Yo I'd love to do it all with you (But I can't)
The grind was designed with no kind of time
To recline with some fine as you (So we rant)
And rave instead of pant and bathe
Like romance is played (I know that can't be true)
I'd rather love and please touch and tease
Hug and squeeze (Or just dance with you)
Use to phone bone 'til we're home alone
Where we moan and groan (Like lovers do)
But the mood gets worse, you're confused and hurt
You think the music's 1st (And you're #2)
I'm trying to show you different, I hope you listen
If you don't I'm fittin to be (Out of my mind)
Let's get out of dodge, get us a lodge
Can I get a massage (And some quality time)

HOOK
Girl hear me when I am speaking so we can hook up a meeting
At whatever spot you frequent or we can just spend a weekend
Of sneaking and creeping, no sleeping, keeping the furniture squeaking
Here to learn what you're teaching in other words all I'm needing is..
You to hear me what I'm speaking so we can hook up a meeting
At whatever spot you frequent or we can just spend a weekend
Of sneaking and creeping, no sleeping, keeping the furniture squeaking
Hear to learn what you're teaching in other words all I'm needing is QT!

BRIDGE
We gon' work it out
Baby we gon' work it out (I know we will)
We... we work it out
Baby we gon' work it out (You know the deal)

V2
How does poetry sound?  We can go to a lounge
Girl I'm hoping you're down (Oh you are that's dope!)
Got real jig 'fore we left the crib
I bet its brick (Let me get my coat)
'Cause if it is that's just another reason to get real close
And stay warm.  Or dead that and stay home
Sometimes doing nothing at all is something special
Or I can just swing to your job and come and get you
Take you on a date and do something unexpected
'Cause time in relationship terms is an investment
So let's not waste it.  Yes I'm anxious
'Cause none at all can test out patience

HOOK

V3
Sometimes these words I can't (Get'em out)
I know you're someone I can't (Live without)
Let me get to the point and stop dancing around
Seems the little things we can't (Figure out)
Then why waste time on such nonsense
Letting it linger in our subconscious
Drowning in BS 'til we get noxious
Is it such a task for us to be honest (With each other?)
Baby give me your all not a piece of you
What you got to hide, you in deep cover?
Wouldn't you rather be in bed covers deep?
Sharing one another's heat while we're under sheets
But are you cool with that tough?
Or we can keep it moving mad slow at no...
Cost at all.  I know the arguments are off the wall
We're back walking tall once it's all resolved
