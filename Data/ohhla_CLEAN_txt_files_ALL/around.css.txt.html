[VERSE 1] (Swizz Beats)
Cassidy I'm gone ball right
I deal wit the raw get it alright
And my chicks get it hard, get it all night
So ladies if you wit me say alright (Alright) say alright
This for my hood mamis
Y'all hard to be trust but what's good mami
I would grip you up if I could mami
'Cuz you ain't gettin' fucked like you should mami
And that ain't good mami
This for the black ladies
We gotta love the mothers of the black babies
'Cuz if we don't do that then it's a wrap baby
So if you from the gutter where you at baby (Oh yeah) where you at baby
This for the white women
The Spanish, Asian and all type women
I got love for my striaght and my dike women
No matter what you like it's alright women (Alright) it's alright women
It's alright

[CHORUS 2x] (Swizz Beats)
To my ladies around the world, world
To my thugs around the world, world
I do this around the world, world
You can't miss me, I'm comin' through

[VERSE 2]
Cassidy I'm gone shine right
Yeah a nigga rhyme, I'm in the limelight
But I had to grind of the crime life
We all gone shine when the time right (Alright) so get ya mind right
This for my hood niggaz
It's hard to come up but what's good nigga
I would break bread if I could nigga
'Cuz you ain't gettin' fed like you should nigga
And that ain't good nigga
This for the rock hustlers
The makin' sales, still on the block hustlers
And in the jails are my cell block hustlers
And most cops just wanna knock hustlers 'cuz they not hustlers
This for my real homies
We done been through it all but we still homies
Man you gotta work hard for a meal homie
Man cats still hungry wit a deal homie, and that's real homie
And that's real

[CHORUS 2x] (Swizz Beats)
To my ladies around the world, world
To my thugs around the world, world
I do this around the world, world
You can't miss me, I'm comin' through

[VERSE 3]
I was born in Philly
We really get it on in Philly
If you from where I'm from I know you feel me
I'mma rep where I'm from until they kill me, until they kill me
And this for N.Y
It's like my second home when I spin by
And them ATL niggaz show me love too
They ladies act crazy when the club do, show me love boo
This for my collie cats
My Baltimore stashin' the ollie cats
From Florida back up to D.C
And Virginia sendin' love when they see me, and that's for GP
I send the rest out
To any other place that I left out
From the north to the east to the west south
Cassidy gone rep 'till he repped out, until he repped out
Yeah yeah

[CHORUS 2x] (Swizz Beats)
To my ladies around the world, world
To my thugs around the world, world
I do this around the world, world
You can't miss me, I'm comin' through</pre>
