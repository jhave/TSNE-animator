[Verse - Violent J]
There ain't nobody, asking me, where I've been
There ain't nobody, that would name me, as a friend
There ain't nobody, that's droppin' by, to say hi
There ain't nobody, that's caring whether I live or die
I have nobody, to tell about, my growing angers
I have nobody, to tell about me, following strangers
There ain't nobody making sure I'm taking all of my pills
There ain't nobody, slowing me down and keeping me still
I'm truly alone..

[Hook]
They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone (truly alone)
They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone (I'm so alone)
They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone (truly alone)
They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone

[Verse - Violent J]
There ain't nobody, telling me, not to jump off
There ain't nobody, telling me not to chop your block off
I get so bloody, I ruin, all of my clothes
I get so bloody, I sit in, the dark alone
I have nobody, to tell about, my dark fantasies
I have nobody, to tell about my dark realities
There ain't nobody, around me, nobody wanna be friends
I get so bloody, all on me, the mess never ends
I'm truly alone..

[Hook]
They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone (truly alone)
They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone (I'm so alone)
They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone (my brain is gone, completely gone)
They say a man can only be alone for so long
Before the man's mind is gone

[Verse - Violent J]
I walked into a Super K, and went to the back
I started askin' questions, checkin' out the chainsaw rack
They had a test model, I pulled the cord and got it runnin'
Turned the blade on the kid working and blood started gunnin'
"What the fuck am I doing?" I dropped the shit and started crying
I made it down two aisles before some hero clotheslined me
I got up, grabbed a shovel and stabbed him in the gut
I pulled it out and hammered it across the back of his nug
I'm hearing sirens going off, it's no blue light specials
I turned murderer, caving in to daily life pressures
But fuck that, now all y'all gonna know me
Seein' me on TV, being like "Look there go my homie"
I'm more than lonely I'm lost, lives are the cost
I just beat some bitch in the head, stabbed her twice and took off
They can't find me I'm hidin' in the flannel coat rack
I jump out and attack and put a gash in your neck
I finally made to the front door and to the parking lot
That's when I got shot a lot, I got got
Police with bullets and more bullets pluggin' me deep
I'm seeing flashes, hearing screamin' and it's all over me
I see a crowd of people being held behind the police tape
All watching me die, I think I made no mistake
I finally got some recognition, dying on my knees
Ready for Hell because compared to my life it should be an ease..
Like easy..
Cake walk..
I'm ready..</pre>
