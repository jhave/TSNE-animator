1992...
See I was born a little pie-eyed motherfucker
Mamma she left me and my pappa was a hard trucker
Out on the highway we loved to roll
He never made me go to school
I never begged to go
I was a low class livin raised out in the sticks
I was born to be a hick
See I love to spend my days just a squirrel huntin
Go see my cousin Ellie May and get some good lovin
Kissin and huggin on some distant lands
People always tell me I'm a twisted man
Jim Beam in my hand boones kegged in shit

And I was born to be a hick
Ohhh I was born to be a hick

See I love to spend my days just a squirrel hunter
Go see my cousin Ellie May and get some good lovin
Kissin and huggin on some distant lands
People always tell me I'm a twisted man
Jim Beam in my hand boones kegged in shit

And I was born to be a hick
See I was born to be a hick man
Yeah I was born to be a hick man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a shotgun tokin
I'm a John Deere drivin
I'm a hick
Ah har</pre>
