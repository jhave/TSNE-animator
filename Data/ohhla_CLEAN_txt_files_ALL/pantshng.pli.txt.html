[Intro]
Heh, hey man~!
A motherfucker just told me to pull my pants up homey (what?)
I went up to that motherfucker told him
Man I'm from the hood and that's how shit go!

[Chorus: Plies]
I let my pants (my pants) hang low (hang low)
I'm from the hood and this how shit go (I'm from the hood)
I let my pants (my pants) hang low (hang low)
So you better not play with my dough
Cause if you do... fo'-fo' (fo'-fo')
I'm from the hood and that's how shit go
I let my pants my pants, hang low (hang low)
I'm from the hood and that's how shit go, nigga!

[Plies]
I'm from the home of goon, city of the choppers
You ain't 'bout that life, you don't want no problems
If you sweet and you know it, fuck it gon' rob ya
Want straight yoppers, fuck with no revolvers
Real street nigga need a real good lawyer
Last two cases, bought fo' charges
In the hood, couple rules that you must follow
If you don't then slugs enter yo' body
Want my paper, get my shorty
Hustle all day, try to ride big body
Been with three dope boys, hood call 'em garbage
Will I still fuck her, I don't know yeah probably
Just a hood nigga with a lot of swag shorty
Who I hang with the most, prolly my forty
Been labeled a goon, that's what the hood call me
Stay in the hood 'til I die homie, that's regardless

[Chorus]

[Hook: Plies]
Say I'm too hood, I might be
I don't give a damn what you thank about me
You say I'ma goon, that's me
I don't give a damn what you thank about me, nigga~!

[Plies]
This where you find the most snitches and most guns
Go four little potnahs right now on the run
Half of the city felons, other half got warrants
Cause they swoll every first of the month
If you ain't got five, you better not stunt
Hood cutthroat, can't even front
Bentley alright, get mo' attention than the dump
No shirt pants saggin with big charm
If it ain't top of the line, I don't want that blunt
Kicked in the trap, came through the front
Jack boys ridin tryin tp find what they want
Ball last night, 4 G's what I spun
Before you fuckin wit me, better take his lunch
Cause if you get behind me then I'm gon' punch
454's under the hood will run
Cause I'm from the hood, and this is how it done

[Chorus] + [Hook]

[Outro: Mannie Fresh]
Yahhhhh! Ladies and gentlemen
You're now listenin to, ghetto music
And it's bein supplied to you by the realest in charge, Plies!
And the dude, Figgy-Fresh
Yeah! Good night y'all</pre>
