Do you want to get high?

Hits From the Bong 
Hits From the Bong 
Hits From the Bong 
Hits From the Bong 

(B-Real)
Pick it, pack it, fire it up, come aloooong 
And take hits from the boooong 
Put the blunt down just for a second 
Don't get me wrong it's not a new method 
Inhale, Exhale - just got a ounce in the mail 
I like a blunt or a big fat coal 
But my double barrel bong is gettin me stoned 
I'm skill it, there's water inside don't spill it 
It smells like shit on the carpet 
Still it, goes down smooth when I get a clean hit 
Of the skunky funky smelly green shit 
Sing my song, puff all night long 
As I take Hits from the bong... 

Hits From the Bong y'all 
Can I get a hit? 
Hits From the Bong 
Can I get a hit? 
Hits From the Bong 
Can I get a hit? 
Hits From the Bong 

(B-Real)
Let's smoke that bowl, hit the bong 
And then take that finger off of that hole 
Plug it, unplug it, don't straaaain I love you Mary Jane 
She never complains, when I hit Mary 
With that flame, I light up the cherry 
She's so good to me, when I pack a fresh bowl 
I clean the screen 
Don't get me stirred up the smoke, through the bub-bling water 
Is makin it pure so I got ta, take my hit and hold it 
Just like Chong, I hit the bowl and I reload it 
Get my four-footer and bring it on... 
As I take Hits from the bong 

(Chorus)
(B-Real)
