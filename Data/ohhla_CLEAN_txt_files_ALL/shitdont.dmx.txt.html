[Snoop Dogg - echoing]
DMX, Snoop Dogg!
Dogs of the world unite, yeah

[Intro: DMX]
This that shit right here
Grrrrrrr, shit don't change
Shit stay the same
Snoop Dogg! C'MON!
DMX! Snoop Dogg! {*4X*}

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg] + (DMX)
Shit don't change, shit stay the same
(Shit don't change) Pop pop bang
(Shit stay the same) I'm doin my thang
(C'mon~!)

[DMX]
Come through grab a nigga, bodybag a nigga
This rifle in his face'll toe-tag a nigga
They wasn't born in it, they was sworn in it
I roll with the wolves, point it out, they gon' GET IT!
Show 'em they gon' HIT IT! That's what we do
Lethal, leave you see-through with the Eagle
Peep through, now he laid up in the box
Lookin like he sleep, "He was the man on the blocks!"
Now niggaz know that's what the rats'll do
Turn, wanna be gangstas into, maggot food
But it'll hurt a nigga with the truth to kill 'em with a lie
You ain't my man! All you wanna do is get a nigga high
I see it in your eye, it ain't nothin real about ya
You's a fraud, it's just how I feel about ya
Look, y'all ain't mobsters, you a posse
Soon as I spot ya, I'ma stomp ya, watch, gotcha

[Chorus] - 2X

[DMX]
Check it
When the dog get hungry, dog gon' eat
So I slide my plate right under a nigga feet
Like them lines in the road I get down to the street
Come through like BRRRAP! Put them cats to sleep
STAY with the heat, cook niggaz, shook niggaz
Me and mines come through, it's nothin but crook niggaz
You off the hook nigga! E'rybody strip!
E'rybody get down cause my niggaz flip!
Spoiled fake niggaz take niggaz, snake niggaz
Make niggaz rape niggaz, I HATE niggaz!
Talkin that riff-raff, get back
They call me extortion nigga, I get half
Fuck what you heard baby, X go hard
Beast in the streets, beast in the yard
It ain't never been NUTTIN to pull a nigga's card
Gangstas come to jail and wanna know God

[Chorus] - 4X

[Chorus] - 2X
