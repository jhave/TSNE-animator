Things have been so crazy and hectic
I should've gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose
You put the tea in the kettle and light
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help

Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
And tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere that had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry bout you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope that you don't get known for nothin' crazy
Cuz no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money
I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose

I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead

But the spotlight makes you nervous</pre>
