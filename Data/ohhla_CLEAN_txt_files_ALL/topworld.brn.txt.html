[Mase]
Brandy, Dark Child
Mase get Harlem on the rise
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
 
[Brandy]
I went from hellions into mini mansions
The girls in Aruba doing belly dancin'
Spent half of my advance on jars from Branson
To make it through my circumstances
But you know I'm wiser now
Move like Tarzan now
Got a butter soft cover just to hide my pound
Got a house in the valley come and find me now
Got enough dough to buy the town
So  I might give a six to my chick
Benz to my mom
Crib so big it look like the center gone
Give her a couch just to spill Henney on
And been a don since lotto's and Benneton
 
[Brandy]
Some people say that I am not the same girl
They say I think that I am in my own world
What makes them think that I have changed, yeah
A little dough cannot erase my problems
Me like you I have to try and solve them
Yes everything is quite the same
 
1 - 	I'm just trying to be me
 	Doing what I got to do
 	Some people think that I'm
 	Just sittin' on top of the world
 	I'm just trying to be me
 	Proving what I've got to prove
 	Some people think that I'm
 	Just sittin' on top of the world
 
Sittin on top of the world
Sittin on top of the world
Sittin on top of the world
Top of the world, top of the world, top of the world
Sittin on top of the world
Top of the world, top of the world, top of the world
 
I wonder why it's often said that my life's
A fairy tale and everything is so right
I wish that you could know the truth, yeah
My life is real so please don't get it twisted
Problems the same and got to be dealt with
These are the things I wish you knew, oh
 
Always in someone's eye so many questions why
How is it to be down with me, with me
Afraid to express myself always me and someone else
 I need to be free but it's not that easy
 
Repeat 1
 
Sittin on top of the world
 
Don't understand why
People think I don' t have friends
Who knew me back when
This was my dream
But nothing has changed
I still do the same things
 
[Mase]
Yo, we can cut the truckin' short 
If it ain't about cake
I ain't sittin on top, I want a house on the lake
I'm that snotty nosed cat wit a new BM
If you mess wit Brandy, I got to bruise your chin
I be with Puff, the girls be like
Who's your friend
If I hit a chick once, she probably move me in
So you gotta tell me right now
Either you wit the cats who make the hits
Or the one that see the chips
(Slow down Mase, you're killing 'em)
But don't stop it
What's the use of buying away
If I'mma have to chop it
I used a leather lady till I learned her logic
She only mess wit Mase, no the money ain't no object
If it ain't Cris, he won't pop it
If it ain't platinum wit ice, he won't rock it
If it don't cost 60, he don't drop it
If it don't come with TV's, he don't cop it
You can stop it
 
Repeat 1
 
Yeah, Brandy on top of the world
Dark Child on top of the world
Mase be on top of the world, what?
Harlem World be on top of the world
 
Brandy on top of the world
Dark Child on top of the world
M-A-Dolla sign-E all over the world
Brandy, all over the world
All over the world
All over the world
Yeah, yeah,  yeah
What, what
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what, what, what
