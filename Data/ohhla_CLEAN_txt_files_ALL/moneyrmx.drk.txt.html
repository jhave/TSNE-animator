[TALKING:]
Southern Smoke {echo}
It's Southern Smoke baby! 
(Money) Frank [?]
(Money) My man Nickelus F
(Money) Ho! It's Drake. Southern Smoke
(Money) This is the remix right here
(Money) So if you got some (Money)
Put ya hands in the air
(Money) Southern Smoke

[Drake]
Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curs
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy! 

[CHORUS]
I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)
Switch countries exchange that (Money)
You cannot get jack for freeee

And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's, no need to stash right (Money)
Got the same, 4 g's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from meeeee, homie
