Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Victory I envision
so my mission is to win
One look at my arm she like wizzle where your skin?
Hating niggas talk
hear they whispers in the wind
but I don't wanna do them harm so I kill them with my pen
Niggas say I'm toro
money don't bend.
Root of all evil
guess my bank is full of sin
Couldn't be a suit and tie
tired of barely paying rent
Told 'em fucker I'm doing numbers so take it on the chin
The top is a [?]
so it's hard to see what I'm eatin'
Going on retreats and rolling sweets while I'm tweetin'
Paradise for a weekend then I'm back in the trap
Never dealt with any drugs still the tats on my back
Money on my mind
everything's strapped
You getting and playing
I'll teach a class how to act
Somebody tell youtube I prolly need a plaque
couple hundred thousand views and not the dot on my mac
09's mine
08 was great
they honor kanye
and paid lil wayne
gucci did it big
but came home and got it straight
and every nigga in the biz did a song with T-Pain
No front page
but for those who did..
I send them my best wishes the industry's a bitch
That's why I'm on my shit
new luggage and a flip
shooting movies all my life no script
no script
