Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
(I'm free!)
Son you gotta just hit it hard
You gotta do it right baby
No bullshittin

[Chorus]
(I'm free!) You free now, are you really?
How free, since when?
You free now, are you really?
How free, since when?

[Blueprint]
Tryin to get a free mind, in these free times
But I only feel free when I freestyle
Any other time, money's on my mind
Can't be free when I'm a slave to free enterprise
Some of us don't get it, we think it's copacetic
Got some free love and ended UP in a FREE clinic
Some free medicine, a free prescription
Some people think bein free means bein unprotected
It ain't right to me, somebody lied to me
When they said that the best things in life are free
It don't seem to be that cool bein free
Cause man brings anything free to its knees
We cut down trees, 'til everything's extinct
Then build free-ways over where they used to be
It's like a free-for-all that keeps me amazed
In the land of free, home of the brave

[Chorus]

[Blueprint]
Let freedom rain down on this whole nation
Full of freemasons and fiends freebasin
Friends freeloadin lookin for a free meal
Girls that got in the club free just to steal
Homeless people think they free, I think it's funny
Cause freedom is a joke when everything costs money
You can't even fuck for free, that's out of the question
Prostitution is the world's oldest profession
Independent women claimin free, could of fooled me
If that's true why you let dude buy you drinks?
It might seem free, cause you didn't pay
But dude who bought you that, he tryin to get laid
Freedom in America, is all about consumption
You ain't free unless you get out there and buy somethin
More spendin, more taxes
More money for our military actions

[Chorus]

(I'm free! ... I'm free!)</pre>
