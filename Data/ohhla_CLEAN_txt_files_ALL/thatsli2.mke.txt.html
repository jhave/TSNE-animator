[Verse 1]
Ms. Oprah, Mr. Cosby, I am right back at your ass
With all honor, Mr. Obama, please don't walk out so fast
I got a question, got a question, got a question for you all
Why when Oscar Grant got murdered, we didn't hear a peep from y'all?
We appreciate the way you delegate for Henry Gates
But what about your people slaving in these fields everyday?
We know that House got air conditioning and the sweetest lemonade
But don't forget your color, brother, we still muthafucking slaves
And that even go for Puffy who so muthafucking paid
That he's richer than these White folks or at least that's what he say
That's what he say, that's what he say, and them petty niggas love it
Think about it, what's a rapper standing next to Warren Buffett?
Ha ha ha, now you niggas are properly enlightened
You can disregard that sell-out shit that Jason Whitlock writing
You can disregard that racist shit that Glenn Beck is reciting
I'm the leader of the gang, tell them to get a mike

[Hook]
I was born and I was raised in the U.S.A.
And I done been around the world and back, what a day
So I done seen a lot of shit and I just want to say
That Lucifer is here to stay, so bitch, you better pray
I was born and I was raised in the U.S.A.
And I done been around the world and back, what a day
So I done seen a lot of shit and I just want to say
That Lucifer is here to stay, so bitch

[Verse 2]
What I'm touching on next, you might want to leave the kitchen
Cuz I'm touching on that touchy subject that they call religion
Kind of touchy like that religion that's touching on your children
But nobody want to talk about that, touching and feeling
On topics that they touching or talking about Jesus said
They liars like they father and sixes is in their head
Bishop Long, what is up with that monkey shit on your head?
Last I checked, vanity was a sin, the Lord said
On my life, I believe you put boys off in your bed
Though some New Birthers and Catholics ain't going to like what I just said
But before you fix your mouth and try to come with a retort
Please be advised that Jesus never took a plea in court
And he never had a plane, and he never had a car
And he never had a church that was visited by stars
But he did have love for the poor and the theives
And he was in the street, kind of similar to me, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Mr. Beck, Mr. O'Reilly, Mr. Limbaugh, Mr. Hannity
How could you sell white America your insanity?
You tell them that they're different and manipulate their vanity
When truthfully, financially their life is a calamity
Otherwise they wouldn't be listening to Dave Ramsey
So they're about as broke as the people that they don't want to be
Convincing them that rich Republicans is what they going to be
So they act like Ronald Regan and like him they're awful actors
Who look up to the rich like dumb kids look up to rappers
And that's about as dumb as a +donkey+ pulling a tractor
Yes, that's a Democrat diss, I'm a detractor
So whether you vote right or vote left it's not a factor
When you ain't got no care for your health, Hey, this America
They going to put your ass in debt something terrible
So you can disrespect presidents and call them socialists
But Palin and Pelosi both going to have you broke as shit
