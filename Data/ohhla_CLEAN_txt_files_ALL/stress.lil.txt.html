Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This the realest shit I ever wrote
This the realest shit I ever spoke

Try and get my mind right through all this stress
I'm a play my cards right and I'm a take my reps

Real people from the world made me do with the best
Niggas can't stop me bitch, I'm a do it till death
Got work, I ain't touched it myself in the mirror man
Niggas too close to the hunt
Niggas ears open bitch and they eyes closed shut
Like a bitch made tell me what my rise show up
We gon slide through the city in the night turnt up

How let you this far niggas lies turnt up
Fuck you bitches if you hating on us
Fuck you if you hating on me, I'm based as fuck
Seen the bar and I raised it up
Rap game like my son, bitch I'm a raise it up
The world on my dick getting paper cuts
Get loose man I take you up, sit back I'm a take you up
That's based as fuck bitch
You get home sick, man you know niggas is sick with it
You feel me, been the wrong stop man, yeah

I'm tryina get my mind right,
Through all this stress, I'm a play cards right
And I'm a take my reps bitch

My foundation from the streets so I never can leave
Fuck a nigga if he don't give me space to breathe
See spaces a place to see, bitches on my dick
Man, you after chasing me
Bitch niggas still chasing leaves, can't find that spot
Where's Waldo, find that drop
Ape shit, better case to me, no case for me
But patient see
The number one thing is patience please
God just knows what the patients need
We all sit living with disease
And you say you clean but not clean as me
Yeah bitch this the thing I believe
Thank you based God, you what the world needs
Based world man is the only thing I see
Never get grounded by the money and weed, Lil B

I'm a tell you who the realest nigga alive man, you feel me
Check it out man
Fuck that shit, I'm a play my cards right and I'm a take my reps
Yeah, I'm just tell you fuck I'm thugged out man
I'm a tell you this man

I'm tryina get my mind right, through all this stress
I'm a play cards right and I'm a take my reps
Yeah man,

Tryina get my mind right, through all this stress
I'm a play cards right and I'm a take my reps</pre>
