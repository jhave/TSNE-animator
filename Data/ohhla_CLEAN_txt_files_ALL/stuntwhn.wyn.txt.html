[Intro]
We the best! (Yeah) Who? We! We the best(uh-huh)
Its alot of money on this track(yeah)
So much money we cant even count it
We gotta weigh it
See what we about to do is? (yeah) whats that wayne?
Exactly (listen) what they cant do! True that!

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Hay we's the number one stunna ha Bow Weezy(speak)
I spit two hundred now my necks so freezy
Hay look my pockets stay fat like Norbit(damn)
Ball so much that I should play for the Hornets(cash ha)
Rocks so rocky I ain't talkin bout the movie(yep)
Your girl love me when done she wipe me down like Boozie(ha damn)
I keep paper a student in school(okay)
Around her we ride 28's, fuck 22's
Nigga try to stunt on me, I'm a stunt way harder(hay)
Black car spinnin call me, Mr. Tear-The-Mall-Up(ha)
So bring niggas to the left to the left
And I'm all about my benjamins just like Mike Epps(money)
When it comes to the hoes hell yeah I got alot(true)
In the club poppin bottles but my name ain't Yung Joc(ha)
And ya already know I'm the freshest
With some many chains on me it'll make Slick Rick jealous(HA)

[Chorus]
(Bow Wow) I'm a young nigga with money
What she gon tell you young nigga with some money
(Lil' Wayne) Hay you young nigga with money(thats me)
What you gon do with all that money
I'ma stunt (when I want to) I'm a stunt (when I have to)
I'ma stunt (what I need to) I'm a stunt (when I see you)
I'ma stunt (when I see you) I'm a stunt (when I see you)
Evertime I see you I'ma stunt (When I see you)

[Verse 2:Lil' Wayne]
Weezy F. Baby, these hold nomen
Young meal ticket, watch me kick it like Shinobi
Flip it like arobics, my flow is so heroic
My girl got a fat ass and I catch it when she throw it
Ill wet you in the mornin, burn ya in the evenin
Dump ya at night and that duffle bag light
Like my shades hella dark and my red flag bright
Got ya bitch blowin me, like she playin bag pipe
Yep I lay that pipe, I'm the plumber to ya women
Im the flame on the stove, in the desert in the summer
I'ma stunna so, I'm gonna stunt on you bitches
Big tow trucks sitin on chrome inches
My account look like foreign digits
Dont play in that water cause today I'm goin fishin
You dont get it, thats why I punch that 430 
Til got it up on inches(too late)
And I'm a young nigga with money
Now what you gon tell a young nigga with MONEY?!

[Chorus]
(Bow Wow) Hay you nigga with money(yeah)
What you gon do with all that money well
I'ma stunt (when I want to) I'm a stunt (when I have to)
I'ma stunt (what I need to) I'm a stunt (when I see you)
I'ma stunt (when I see) I'm a stunt (when I see)
Evertime I see you I'm a stunt (When I see you)

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
If your watch cost a hundred, you ain't ridin 28's
You ain't stuntin like this (no)
You ain't stuntin like this (no)
And if your crib didnt come with the butlers and the maids
You ain't stuntin like this (no)
You ain't stuntin like this (no)
And if you ask for the price, when you shop at the mall
Then you ain't stuntin like this (no)
Then you ain't stuntin like this (no)
And if you dont make it rain, when your up in the club
Then you ain't stuntin like this (no)
Then you ain't stuntin like this (no) NAW!

[Chorus 4X]
 
Say nigga this ain't gon stop know what I mean
Thats me! shiittt! What you know about ridin 26's nigga
Better read about this nigga real talk
My paper long baby what I'm sayin man
You niggas got to get your weight up
Better eat some weaties around here nigga for real</pre>
