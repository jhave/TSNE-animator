[Verse 1]
Beautiful is how we know you though
Rebel, rebel, for all your people
Until the talons of the bald eagle
Reach out and rip the back of your head off leaving your skull peaceful
Beautiful is how we know you though
We were all taught to root for the underdogs
One nation under got complex
No wonder we all wanna watch 'em undercover cops
Beautiful is how we know you though
So beautiful, so upset
Came from a place that bred success
So shame on the grass on that side of the fence
Beautiful is how we know you though
Guess daddy didn't hold you enough
I ain't saying that you never had to struggle for a buck
Or some luck or some love, motherfucker join the club
Beautiful is how we know you though
Give the kid a paintbrush and a subject
Self-portrait caricature of the undead
Skeleton staring at a picture of the sunset
Beautiful is how we know you though
Misunderstood is not a birthright
The monster lost control after the first bite
Master your high life, bitch get your swerve right
Beautiful is how we know you though
It ain't new to you, ain't that unusual
And we knew you fully meant it when you drew
Your little line in the sand and chose to stand with the beautiful
Beautiful is how we know you though
I hope you live to tell the war tale yourself
I wish you well on escape from your hell
But 'til then stay the fuck off my doorbell</pre>
