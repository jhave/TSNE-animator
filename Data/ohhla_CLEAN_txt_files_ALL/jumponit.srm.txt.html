Welcome to the 2 1 4
Big B, D Texas
Let mr. sexes flex this lexus
And this where the cowboys play
They battle with my team from the bay
Frisco
Now I'm from the northwest
But I likes my soul food
So I'm calling up an old groove
And I'm a brother with a gut
So, hello Keana, can ya take us out to Poppa Doughs
And don't forget about San Antone
The last time I went thru
I took three broads home
And much love love to the brothers in Austin
And the 5 1 2
I'm flossin in Lawston
A state that's as big as hell
And I spot two bad ass girls in a tercel
They said what's up?  And I said whassup? (We're going to Houston)
And I said giddy up, U-turn

What's up Phoenix, what's up (x2)

And I'm sippin on a lemonade
Phoenix Arizona puts the heat up on ya

The girls as fine as California
Speaking of Cali
Check your mack daddy
He gots game, and knocks dames from Redding to the Valley
And I can pull'em on a TJ border
I even knock mr. G's daughter
And come on up to the 7 0 2
Where it's legal to gamble, and hoing is too
The kinda city I could run wit
Las Vegas na vi dad, I love it
Back to the 2 0 6
Double up my grits
And Sea-town giving po po fits
Chasing the skirts like a playa supposed ta
348 roasta HIT IT! (ho, ho, ho... ooh Lord)
