Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus - Young Jeezy]
They need a hoodstar, been there sold all that
Plus he really played with them thangs whatcha call that?
Hoodstar, erryday on some hood shit
Pocket fulla money yeah you know a nigga hood rich
Hoodstar, been there, counted all that
Tell that boy official by the way her wear his ball cap
Hoodstar, be in the spot with all his chains on
Crazy when this drop this that real nigga theme song

[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
Walk off with a mission in hand - save the day
And the real gon' follow ya nigga, pave the way
That's why these other niggas follow you Young, cause you the leader
OK, I'm 'bout to take 'em to school, guess who the teacher?
What the fuck man? Them numbers as high as a Delta flight
Why you think a nigga high eryday? That delta light
Yeah you know my life is outta control, hope I dont crash
Think my partner on 3 Exxon, I'm on that gas
Thinking erryday is 24/8, I'm 'bout that cash
Shoot that copper 28 for the 8 don't make me laugh (hahaaaa)
Gimme erry white brick in the world, that ain't enough
But I get in there and anybody that need 'em - This shit is rough
They need (a hero)

[Chorus - Young Jeezy]
They need a hoodstar, been there sold all that
Plus he really played with them thangs whatcha call that?
Hoodstar, erryday on some hood shit
Pocket fulla money yeah you know a nigga hood rich
Hoodstar, been there, counted all that
Tell that boy official by the way her wear his ball cap
Hoodstar, be in the spot with all his chains on
Crazy when this drop this that real nigga theme song

[Verse 2 - Slick Pulla]
Hoodstar, you understand what I'm sayin'?
Check out my D-Boy sneaks, check out the way I play 'em
Unlaced Releskas, I count stacks all day
Hit the stash up then fibs tonight we goin' to play
And you know how the real do it, it's this club, that club
Open up justice, it's time for some late grub
Kickin' big shit, them hoes love that
We style breakfast, the lames try to handcuff the swag
And I'm just tryna put up some shots on that new Jag
You catch me slippin', fuck around and catch the whole mag
We throw them clothes up on the counter fuck the pricetags (fuck em!)
White paint, white C's call it the white flag

[Chorus - Young Jeezy]
They need a hoodstar, been there sold all that
Plus he really played with them thangs whatcha call that?
Hoodstar, erryday on some hood shit
Pocket fulla money yeah you know a nigga hood rich
Hoodstar, been there, counted all that
Tell that boy official by the way her wear his ball cap
Hoodstar, be in the spot with all his chains on
Crazy when this drop this that real nigga theme song</pre>
