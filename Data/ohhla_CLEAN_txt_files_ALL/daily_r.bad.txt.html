Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
From the block to the top
Budha baggies in a sock
Only thing that changed now
Is we ain't runnin' out of stock
Use to beg mom dukes for lunch money
Honies used to run from me
When pockets was dust bunnies
Now what's funny
Is when done came up and conquered
Even the future lookin' bonkers from Compton to Yonkers
Though them gangstas grill
I tell 'em keep that drama away
Don't fuck with thieves
I like Jay so who sponsorin' the tape
They launchin' out straights
I'm tryin' not to get sprayed
Whether it's spitter or a quiter behind the trigger
Approachin' his prey his eyes bigger
Won't stop to consider what's right or wrong
Because it's hard liquor that's inside his liver

[Hook: x2]
But that's just daily routine
The streets is couped fiends
Whether the hoops or the booth
Niggas shoot dreams
Better choose the right scheme
Cause you can think you cool with yo nice things
Get wiped cleaned for ice cream when the light speed

[Verse 2]
Traded in my Nikes for a new mic
I guess it's safe to say
He sold soles for his new life
Like they were tryna blind us
But we know the true designer
They didn't wanna see us find the diviners
So now we hit the vines
Up day and night on the regular
I know my momma prayin'
Like she want me reach my aims in life
But just stay in sight
So I'm shootin' for my dreams
Hit the booth and it boost my esteem
The Pro Era crew recruitin'
And them fiends by the boat load
Nigga caught a wave and now he surfin' coastal
They don't feel the name
But they say that music dope though
Fuck it that's how it's supposed to go
These bloggers too emotional
They'll be postin' you
Until labels start Interscopin' you
By then it's Wale
And I'll be chillin' where I lay
Cause I rather see the top
Than to be livin' where I lay</pre>
