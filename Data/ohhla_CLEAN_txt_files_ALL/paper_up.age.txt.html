[Planet Asia]
Yeah
Ye-ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye, ye-yeah
Ah one two

[Repeat 4X]
La la la la la LAH, la la-lah

[verse One]
I was chillin on the corner, just me and my fam
And everybody had at least a G in they hand
That's when one of my brothers came with this master plan
He told me, "As' - no more sellin this hand to hand
You got talent then you should use it don't waste it man
There comes a time in your life one must take a stand"
I looked at him and said, "You got me mistaken man
It'll all come in time, just be patient man," but

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
My peoples gotta get they paper up
Cause nowadays these streets ain't safe for us
How many more lives they gon' take from us
This life will make you crazy like angel dust

[Verse Two]
I wrote this for my peoples who stay on the grind
The Lord might not come when you call but he's always on time
Like this friend of mine I know who was left behind
Had no one to care so therefore it vexed his mind
But then he transformed his energy, utilized his strength
and took it as a blessing as a part of his identity
No need for worry just keep your pride
Crooked cops on the block with the piece inside, but

[Chorus]

[Asia] Now everybody sing it!

[Repeat 4X w/ ad libs]
La la la la la LAH, la la-lah

[Verse Three]
If you ain't got no dough, get your paper up
All the mothers on the Earth, just pray for us
It will be many more lives that they take from us
But in the end there really ain't no escapin us
I used to think that I would end up paperless'
'Til the homies in the hood started cakin up
But I'm an artist, no not as in paintin brush
But a hustler's theme song, your favorite stuff

[Chorus]

[Asia] Now everybody sing it!

[Repeat 8X w/ ad libs]
La la la la la LAH, la la-lah

[Planet Asia]
