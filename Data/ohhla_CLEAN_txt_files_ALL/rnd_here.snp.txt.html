[Chorus] - X 2
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggaz quick to air ya out
and lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggaz will put ya
in the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

[Snoop Dogg]
M.L. and 21st, where niggaz worse
Quick to put one in ya first
Before they search your pockets get that china
And where they got ya that's where they gon' find ya
They rollin' out there nigga, that's that real shit
Where bein' slick can get you caught up real quick
Hold up homie, don't let this money blind ya
Cause you won't see me standin' right behind ya
Then it's time's up, that's how we talkin' if he come from the Beach
Better watch them niggaz out here if they come from the East
Don't stop if I'm not out somewhere so niggaz can see
Cause they don't give a fuck, you stuck if you ain't with me
My city's a beast..
You can't walk through the Beach unless you walk with a piece
You can't talk to police 'cause most police is like me
They get that cheddar like they want it, take yo' shit in the street
They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea

[Chorus] - X 2
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggaz quick to air ya out
and lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggaz will put ya
in the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

[Snoop Dogg]
This L.A. County nigga
If you's a bitch then get yo' ass from 'round here nigga
Before they come put bullets in yo' brain
Cause in the hood ain't nothin' really changed
They tryin' to get that paper just like Uncle Sam
And just like Sam niggaz just don't give a damn
They mission is to leave yo' ass in pain
Cause they don't give a fuck about a thing
It's a cold game, that's how they talkin' if they walk on the West
Better watch yourself without this star protectin' your chest
These niggaz come from nowhere, get to takin' yo' shit
You'll get beat outside the set and then sent home in your stretch
This shit is a mess..
You can't walk in them streets unless you walk with your vest
You can't talk to police 'cause most police ain't gon' stress
They get that cheddar like they want it with they foot in your chest
They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea

[Chorus] - X 2
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggaz quick to air ya out
and lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggaz will put ya
in the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here</pre>
