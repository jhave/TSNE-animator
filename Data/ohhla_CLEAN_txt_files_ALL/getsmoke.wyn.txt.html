Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus]
09, we tote; my niggaz ain't no joke
And we keep them blows, so please don't get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked

[Lil Wayne]
I'm rollin, all my niggaz rollin
Keep that fuckin red bandana: Hulk Hogan
I'm cuttin up like scissors, coming down hard like blizzards
I'm gettin head while givin head, that's a head-on collision
I'm on a pain pill, I keep this shit trill
These niggaz ain't for real, like a fire drill
Yo' hoe on my back like a fuckin fifth wheel
That bitch make her pussy open and close like fish gills
I put all my niggaz on, but some of them niggaz gone
Them niggaz callin my phone; leave me alone
I'm lightin up that strong, then pass it to my bro
Numbers don't lie - ex-cept five-oh
Different colored Trukit shirts, you niggaz put on yo' skirts
If I die off these percs, put a bad bitch in my hearse
My hoes lift up they shirts, I'm high as Captain Kirk
If we run out of work, we +Rob+, like +Burke+

[Chorus] - 2X

[Lil Mouse]
Corlay R.I.P. him, Darnell R.I.P. him
If you disrespect them, then you gon' meet them
My niggaz rollin fo'-seated that bitch goin she a eater
She was a good girl, I turned her to a eater
Hit Squad move bugband, young nigga on freeband
.30 clip and them hollow tips, make him do the runnin man
A buck forty I'm fuckin with, I'm rollin with my hitters
I'll send my hitters ,out to go get you
Hella bands, hella bands, hit the club throwin hella bands
Heavy load, throwing hella bands, in the club doin the money dance
Hella bands, hella bands, hit the club throwin hella bands
Heavy load, throwin hella bands, in the club doin the money dance
Niggaz talkin shit in the club, he better watch hisself
Melly got the .30 on his hip, he gon' need some help
I'm a gangster nigga, and I could do this shit my fuckin self
Pistol to his melon; it ain't gon' be nuttin left

[Chorus] - 2X

[Lil Wayne]
Ridin 'round with my gangsters, runnin up in these yellow hoes
Everybody wanna suck my bitch, her pussy lips like heaven do's
It's pussy money and kush, skateboards and shroom
These niggaz think they the shit, these niggaz perfume
Hollygrove, so Hollygrove, all I know is Hollygrove
I'm sick with it, I been diagnosed, we don't cut the coke that's Diet Coke
These niggaz broke I'm paid in full, blood gang, Red Bull
My tongue like a surfboard and her pussy like a wave pool
Tunechi~!

[Chorus] - 2X

[Outro]
