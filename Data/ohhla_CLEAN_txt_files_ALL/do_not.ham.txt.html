Song:   Do Not Pass Me By
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Pass me not Oh gental savior
Hear my humble cry
While the others thou are calling
Do not pass me by

I've got the feelin' and the feelin's not the same
I did the hip hop a little hammer and the james
But a touch a touch from up above
And I get the feelin' the feelin of your love
Reachin out (reachin out)
Callin' for your people
To keep us all safe from a world that's full of evil
Tryin' cryin'
Lord sometimes I'm cryin
When I think of his gifts and the world jusk keeps denying

When I think of his goodness and what he's done for me
My soul cries Hallelujah
Thanks for savin' me SING

Savior, savior, why don't you
Hear my humble cry

While the others thou are calling
Do not pass me by

(Dance break?)

I don't want the lord to pass me by [x7]

Ii need him
At home
At work
At school
Do you need him?
I know you need him!

While the others thou are calling
Do not pass me by

Do not pass me BY!</pre>
