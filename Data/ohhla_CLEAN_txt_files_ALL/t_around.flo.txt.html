Shawty got it droppin' around and I'm sold
And we gotta couple of rounds of new dough
Everybody lookin' around like uh oh
Oh babe whatcha say?

Shake it with a little bit of Beyonce
Turn around &amp; give it to me shawty get paid
Do it for them girls

On stage I wanna be amazed

Top that, got that
Work for this stage
Stop that, lock that

Let loose get a looey like hers
You the troop get money it's yours
Back it up like that, yes sir!

Oh-oh baby want some more baby?
I love the way you do it 'cause you do it so crazy

It's your sexy that got me now
Winnin' a bet that can't shut you down
Come embrace the way you makin' it sound
Workin' the middle again
Makin' it jiggle again
Hello let's go just know
I love the way you do it
How you take it to the floor
Show 'em how you do it
Like yo ready for the flow
Baby you can do it 50 times in a row
Them rows get ready for yo pose
Lights, camera, action
Lose control
Ain't got the price these shoes are pro
All types of magic lose the clothes
Gotta party like yo girl
Make yo booty go stupid, girl
So hot that I love them grr
Off top shawty mark my words

Oh-oh baby want some more baby?
I love the way you do it 'cause you do it so crazy
