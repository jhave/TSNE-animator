[Slug]
I do believe in monsters, I call them officers
I know enough to know to keep an eye on how I talk to them
Some of ya'll are peace, but even one two many
Is still a decent number for the breeding of a beast
With no release, she keeps and teaches no remorse
More resembling of a thief than a horse
Plans long range, attached to some fangs
And an arm that's strong, watch the song when they change
Nothing's strange, cause you know before you saw it
It's all the same, there ain't no such thing as flawless
But all I want is a little more security
A little more safety, a lot less uncertainty
Override the circuitry, the sun is your god(?)
Recognize the urgency, uncover your eyes
When I turn on the lights, she vanishes, hides
But I can feel here essence in the air
Acknowledge the night stalker and regard her as a hunter
Count the amount she takes from the slumber
Summer ain't as hot as you would think
Martyr(?) the child that wears the target for the teeth to sink

[Chorus]
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This country's a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This city's a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge

[Slug]
She lurks in the alleys with the wrong reality
Allegiance, honor, keep it all in the family
Consumes the young, blind, deaf, and the dumb
Drains the vein and puts them under the thumb
She's on the television, celebrate status quo
Energy, push mute on the remote control
Break the beats, shatter the measure to pieces
All I've left is the breath and the will to prove the thesis
It's difficult to figure out who to fear
Gettin' older by the minute, younger by the year
Will the hunger disappear, metabolism slow
World domination is the goal
Now let's gather the kids, and take em' out to the sticks
Teach em' all how to live, come take my hand and walk with me
Before the vampires lock down the Twin Cities

[Chorus]
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This country's a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This city's a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge

[Slug]
Through the mud of the evening she trudges
The name, the blood is tainted with traces of loveless
From up above, truth watches in bewilderment
Contemplating how he really isn't feeling it
Just another chapter of another moving picture
Another after thought looking for a new elixir
But if she goes even when she has to climb
Out the window, out of sight, out of mind
Look out for me below because I've never been on top of nothin'
Other than a stove inside a pot of water bubblin'
And boilin' between a puzzle and poison
Two games in the same toy bin
But when my times comes you better beat the drums
And aim the guns at the ones that eat the young
If we let her, she'll do whatever it takes to survive
You don't stop till you take her life

[Chorus]
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This country's a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This city's a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge

[Little Girl's Voice]
I don't wanna to go
(???)
And she's really ugly

Check the orphanage...
[Chorus]
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
All of ya'll are vampires, you eat your kids</pre>
