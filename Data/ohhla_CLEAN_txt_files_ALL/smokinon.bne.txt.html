[Snoop Intro] (Layzie)
Yeah, look what the wind done blew in (Snoop Dogg)
The Big Snoopy D-O double Gizzle (Ken Dawg)
Representin' Dogghouse Records (Skant-O)
East side, L-B-C
All the way out here in the Midwest (East 99)
with my nephew Layzie Bone, Mo' Thugs (yeh, East 99)
And I brought a couple of my homeboys with me too (St. Claire)
So you know we about to get ugly up in this motherfucker (Let's do this)
Y'know? Yeah (yeah) all you niggaz that be eavesdroppin' or ear hustlin'
Smokin' on information (Yeah)
You know what time it is (sucker-ass niggaz)
We 'bout to serve to ya'll (flat out) for the 2000 plus 2
Ooh wee, yabba dabba doo
(It's the Movement baby, this is The Movement)

[Snoop Verse]
Fo-fo in my bag, mo-mo in my glass
Po-po's on my ass, man they want a nigga bad
I zig and I zag cause I got expired tags
I'm just tryin' to make it to my nephew Layzie's pad
Dippin' in the old school 6-7 rag
Either I'm a throw out the mag or blast they ass
Fast with the decision
Cash was my envision
Life's about havin' it, stackin' it, and crackin' it
While I'm flippin' these bitches
No more chickens, they livin' so fa'gazy
Layzie let's just kick it
Get it, got it, pop it for me one time
If you want to switch, lock it for me one time
Now do the three-wheel motion, coastin'
From the Mid-wicked-West to the ocean, smokin'
My nigga what you holdin'?
A bizzle fa' shizzle
G'd up in Snoop Dogg clothing

[Chorus] Little Joe (Layzie) 2x
Smokin' on information
(Real niggaz do real thangs)
We're smokin' on, this is our congregation
(From the North to the South to the East to the West)
Dogg House and Bone

[Skant]
I'm from the, nitty gritty
I'm comin' to shake up the whole city with this
Midwest flow
That keepin' 'em bouncin' and beggin' for Mo'
This thugs shit all wit da rulin'
And you know It'd can't be judged
I never'd go Hollywood
Cause they cannot change this thug about this paper
And never to raised to be a fame chaser
My mama'd always told me my shit would be greater later
Smokin'd on information and sippin' the ol' E
The world wouldn't be shit without them gangsta's and T-H-U-G'S
So take head motherfucker'd before you lose out
I got my family Mo' Thugs and the Dogghouse
Who comin' with it light puff aquited
I wonder who really did it?
I'm Skant Bone if you think you know my tone
Invitin' all haters and bustas to the murda zone
They better be ready cuz
Cause the war is on
Mo' Thugs, Dogghouse nigga
Mo' Thugs, and we out nigga

[Chorus] 2x

[Ken Dawg]
I'm in here lightin' up somethin' smokin'
Long as my niggaz leave me open, floatin'
Ask 'em what's the 4-1-1 on all this potent
Suckin' up the love, Doggouse and Mo' Thug
Ken Dawg and doubled'll hustle
As I muscle through scrubs, congregatin'
Makin' my pressence "Oh what a essence"
I ain't stressin' 'bout no second hand ass nigga with suggestions
Hey holla Mo' Thug (Mo' Thug)
Haters hold up, you know what?
I think that's Ken Dawg
Yep, show love
With the Big Snoop D-O
Smoke until we P-O
Playas we came, together to get this money 'fore we G-O
They love me for that
They know I'm in love with the scratch
I hear a million niggaz hollin' how they want a contract
I analyze'd all, information exposed in the air
Judge it for myself and told you my repsonse as a playa
Set up and had it, stretched out
World wide spread
All the way from the 2-1-6 to the 2-1-3 here

[Chorus] 2x

[Layzie]
You better believe a nigga be stompin' in my big black boots
Lil' Lay and Snoop comin' though and I thought you knew
Niggaz gon' do what they do
And I play this game like I bring it
Do this shit cause I mean it
Seen it come together so clean, shit
Do you know who I'm the team wit?
Only them, real live playas from the block to the stage
Keepin' it locked and gettin' payed
Nothin' but thugs in our ways
It's them polished pimpin' playas
Poppin' pistols packin' drama
I'm a put it like this
Pretty much I'm that nigga that'll bomb ya
If you want it, you can get it
Information, let me hit it
Can you feel me, nigga you dig it?
If you wit it, nigga what is it?
It's just them doggs in the house and mo' and mo' comin' in
So nigga blaze it, raise the roof
Nigga lights, camera, action
Cause that's what's happenin'
Real niggaz unite
And do it right, cause if you don't
You might not get it twice
That's why I be, parlayin'
G'd up and Sharpei' and
I do this all day and
Your nigga Layzie Bone is in the house

[Chorus] 4x

Thugs</pre>
