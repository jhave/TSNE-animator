Song:   I Love Your Style
Typed by: truethorobredz@gmail.com

Long hair, blowin in the wind, girl I like that
Top floor no neighbors where we spend the night at
Penthouse, c-notes and Pinot in Reno
Push your buttons til I hit the jackpot, casino
We can hit the strip play the beach for a slow dance
If Trey invented sex baby I invented romance
Alviero Martini bag full of lingerie
Keep your heels on, lose the rest, climb on top of me
Skin like you bathing in caramel and strawberry
Call you Lady Thoro can't stand when you apart from me
I like your flava giiiirl - give it to me all the time
Waitings not my thing treat everyday like Valentines
Girl I love your style, like I really really dig that
Bent over the poker table with your big stacks
Down for my girl she put it down for me
Tierra for my Lady Thoro and a crown for me, I love your style

She got that gucci lucci style
Those prada dollars strech a mile
That fendi fetti make er smile
Gucci lucci style girl I love your style

Gucci lucci status, something bout your fragrance
Eyes like a pair of chandeliers, past radiant
Everything is pancakes and syrup when I'm with ya
But one kiss got my head spinning like a sizla
Spending young money on my girl you da you da best
Feel your heart beat jumping right out cha out cha chest
Writing love notes with a Mont Blanc pen
Know you're thinking he's joking - well - think again
Other girls stressing on hair and their complexion
But not you, you're perfect because of your imperfections
Been a lifetime since I met someone so real
Which is why its so hard putting words to what I feel
All night caress until we watch the sun rise
Fly TDot to LA and watch it rise twice
Down for my girl she put it down for me
Tierra for my Lady Thoro and a crown for me, I love your style

The King of charts, the queen of hearts
It feels so good its jus the start
Got your ex-man texting so why not tell the truth
Say that you're with Mr Thoro what the fuck he gonna do?
Want to be with you but life isn't fair
And I can't lie shorty other women don't compare
So stick around and see
Tiara for my Lady Thoro and a crown for me, I love your style</pre>
