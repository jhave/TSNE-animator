Ladies and gentlemen, I like to introduce you all to a new game
It's called Dope Ball
Similar rules and regulations, but at the same time very different

Hahaha

Goes a lil something like this

It's not pick 'n roll, it's more like pick a roll
What you gon' push? We waste a blow
If it's all three, then that's the three from the top of the key,
before you cup a brick, scrape some grams of the top of the key
Same for the blow, we call those free throws, they call 'm cheerleaders, we call 'm cheap ho's
Find some low ones, have them beg a few O's
Next thing you know you're putting numbers on the... boat
The whole point is to stay on the courts, but, in this game the whole point is to stay outta courts
Yeah they similar, but not the same sports
Both international, import, export
Extort, and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought
Extort, and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought

Dope Ball, Dope Ball, we play, we play, we playing, Dope Ball, Dope Ball
This is called what? Dope Ball, Dope Ball!
I know y'all later, if you push weighter, you see a Dope Ball!</pre>
