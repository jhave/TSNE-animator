[Marsha]
Yeah, uh, ye-eah, uh
Gotta say you make me smile, you're like the sunshine
You're like the sunshine, ohh baby

[Verse 1: Marsha]
You passed me by, yeah
I remember you and I, yeah
Back when I was rocking Nik-es
Pop it like along the block, yeah
Drawn your attention to me
You became my first and only
Do you recall that good weed?
Said I want that old thing only back, you know baby

[Chorus: Marsha]
Feels so good to me (ooh boy)
Damn I think my heart just skipped a beat (ooh boy)
Love it when you look-look looking at me (ooh boy)
Ooh I gotta say you make me smile, you're like the sunshine
You are my sunshine (you're like the sunshine)
My baby, yeah (ooh baby)

[Verse 2: Marsha]
I was satisfied, yeah
Got me going through it all over again
I've been trying to get you up out of my head
Then there you go again, make me, you make me smile I'm
Just like the eighties
And a disco dancing baby
And I feel like roller-skating
You got me feeling fresh and ooh it feels so good

[Chorus: Marsha]
Feels so good to me (ooh boy)
Damn I think my heart just skipped a beat (ooh boy)
Love it when you look-look looking at me (ooh boy)
Ooh I gotta say you make me smile, you're like the sunshine
You are my sunshine (you're like the sunshine)
You are a star (ooh baby)

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Uh, yeah, this Phontigga
Baby girl, you the truth and I ain't even lying
Got me walking on a cloud and I ain't even flying
And when the lights go out, you pull the curtains on a nigga
Put a hurtin on a nigga like you ain't even trying
And tonight won't be no interruption
While we sipping on some beano, handling our B.I.
Just like G.I., Shazam and Dino
Bringing that old thing back, music for the people

[Verse 4: Rapper Big Pooh]
I love it when you look at me when you say that
'Poobie's your baby,' them other bitches hate that
Tell 'em hit the playback, sing it for 'em y'all an'
Show 'em how the dimples and charm keep 'em falling
I goes all in, body and mind
That's how I keep you coming back every single time
Uh, cause more rich and more better you'll find
But nobody's bars taste better than mine, Rapper!

[Chorus: Marsha]
Feels so good to me (ooh boy)
Damn I think my heart just skipped a beat (ooh boy)
Love it when you look-look looking at me (yeah)
Ooh I gotta say you make me smile, you're like the sunshine
You are my sunshine (you're like the sunshine)
You are a star (ooh baby)</pre>
