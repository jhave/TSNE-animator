Now you want my love, well that's alright
Well it will be there for you, morning, noon and night
But you gotta be good, and do it right
Ain't got no time for part-time loving in my life
Well you wanna be loved, huh, hey that's okay
Cause it falls in line right with my sexuality
But you gotta be down, a nickel gotta be true
Cause otherwise this B ain't got no time for you, oh 

Baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Cause if you gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

Well, you want my heart, and all my time
But it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
Cause a girl like me, won't settle for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

Long as you know, that I can have any man I want to baby
That's actual and factual, but still I choose you
To be with me, and work on it, so you better not flake it up
Ooooooooooooooooh

Baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Cause if you gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

Baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Cause if you gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

Baby, long as you know, that I can have any man I want to 
Baby, that's actual and it's factual
But still, I choose you, to be with me
And work on that, so you better not flake it up

Well, you want my heart, and all my time
But it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
Cause a girl like me, I won't settle for less
I require plenty conversation with my se------x

Baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Cause if you gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

I can have any man that I want to 
Time and place that I choose to
But I'm thinking that I would rather be here with you, yea
That's actual and factual
You're the one I seem to run back to, just to get me off
You got to love me, got to love me, got to love me

Baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Cause if you gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

Baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Cause if you gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

I said any man that I want to 
Time and place that I choose to
But I'm thinkin that I would rather be here with you yeah</pre>
