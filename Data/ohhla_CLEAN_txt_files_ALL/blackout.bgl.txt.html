[Big L]
I be puffin' blunts in the house, hittin' stunts on the couch
This year, crazy cats gon' get punched in they mouth
When your wife see me, she don't know how to act
So don't be mad when I blow out her back; for real
Your whole crew's a buncha poo butts, made a few bucks
J'd a few sluts, then ya'll started runnin' your lips a little too much
Got chedda to blow, pockets never get low
Chickens sweat me wherever I go
Me and O.C. be in the Lex', Cartier specs, Nautica sweats
Gore-Tex, with Presidentials on, full of baguettes
I done sold coke, sold crack, sold smoke, sold smack
Now I wanna gold plaque, can I get a soul clap?
Some cats be col' wack
You got the lye? Well brother, roll that
And if it won't get me high, then hold that
I'mma cop me a six, and cruise through the block with your trick
I'mma keep droppin' them hits, it won't stop 'til I'm rich

[O.C.]
Any mic I hold in the grip of my palm
I wave it over the crowd, dictating shit like Genghis Khan
Nonchalantly deliver the flow like drug traffic
Scolding, bringing somatic to this rap shit
Bona fide. Mic set, you can't see me on it
Master the art, so now I just flaunt it
Born to live a life and die, but 'til then
I'mma keep on writing slick rhymes with the pen
I take the cherry from a beat like a virgin havin' innocent
Bust my nut, bring rhyme to life like Genesis
Poetical renaissance, endeavors are flawless
Tearing it up when it comes to me picking up this cordless
One of New York's finest
On this trip, I coincide with Beatminerz
Bringing out the best in me
We formulatin' like a recipe
Water and dough, we sho' 'nuff
Bestow my presence
Then I'm divine like the seven
Keeping it tight, cause what I suffice is raw nigga
It's only right

[Big L]
Like that, y'all

[O.C.]
It's like that, y'all

[Big L]
On the Blackout Rap show, with my man Phat Phillie
Check it out, uhh
We about to get into a verse like this
Check me out, y'all

[DJ Phat Phillie]
Hmm-mmm

[Big L]
Yeah, yeah
A couple of years ago, before the year nine-fo'
My cash flow was low, I was low on dough
Used to try to talk to fly girls, and they was like: No!
I knew that all of that'd change once I started to blow
Now my pockets are bloated, because I exploded
Stay devoted, dropped a hot album, now I'm loaded
I hang with fly stars, buy cars, for fifty-thou'
The New York City child, thug with a pretty smile
I love this rap game, that's why I married it
It's a big load, but somebody gots to carry it
At one point I was about to give up
Then got offered a record deal, and my eyes lit up
In 1992, boo, my dream came true
First I got the fame, then the cream came through
Word up, I used to rhyme all the time
Whoever thought that slim kid from one-three-nine'd
Shine down the line, huh?
I used to sell cracks, now I sell tracks
Listen up, cause when L raps, he tell facts
I'm the type of cat to lay wack MCs to rest
I was told to work hard to achieve success
Words of wisdom from my father
He said: L, when things ain't going so well
Don't give up, try harder
And never be afraid to make mistakes
And don't spend your cash foolishly, save your papes
Cause good things come to those who wait they turn
Stay concerned, cause it's a lotta papes to earn
And help those that's less fortunate than you
And stay true to whatever you do, until you're through

[O.C.]
Yo, uhh
O.C.'s illin', I will never, ever bore you
O.C.'s illin', I will never, ever bore you
To rock like I do, it takes certain zest
I'm truly untouchable, like Elliot Ness
See, my word and verse is fly. One moment tranquil
Then the next minute it goes with the strength to kill
I can rock a party right, all night, just trust me
Not an MC out there who can touch me
Anywhere I go, young ladies, they rush me
When I'm on the mic, no way in hell you can hush me
My mere presence will leave you in awe
And when I'm through you too will call me pa-pa
Now is the time to settle this vendetta
Slicin' MCs like a Swiss-cheese shredda
If you don't like Swiss, then I cut you like chedda
Thick, slow and quick, great pain it will inflict
The beat's on time and the cuts all click
Elegant, never meant, I loves to invent
If you heard me say I rock, this is what I meant
I don't shriek, I speak, I could never be weak
I got the crowd overwhelmed with my rap mystique
I'm shrewd, never booed, I wear the MC crown
When I step in the place, MCs, they bow down
Suckas I will smash, they're not fit for the class
Yo, when we get on the mic, they break out like a rash
Cause my sonic, atomic MCs get moronic
Chillin' with Big L, we like: It's bionic
Charismatic, emphatic, bass has no static
Strungin' off the rhyme like a cocaine addict
Nothing but cheers, call O.C. the leader
Def rhyme writer, fake MC defeater
Girlfriend said you're sweet, but I'm sweeter
I'll slay any MC in this rappin' arena
Colossal, not a fossil, MCs are quite docile
Teach what I'm preaching, you can call me an apostle
Tall, not short, dog, and this is the sport
I'm a soldier with the mic, and I'm guarding my fort
And MCs are no bigger than my big toe
And I get higher rating than The Cosby Show
When I recite my rhyme, just for you, my friend
Big L, jump on this mic and flow once again

[Big L]
Yo it's L the Harlem
Check it out, bust it
Yo it's L, the Harlem pimp baby
For real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady
And that's ill
Playa hatas be giving me harsh looks
But I'm tryin' to sell records like Garth Brooks
Forget em all
Yo, it's L the Harlem pimp baby, just like I said
Right now, I'm going off the top of the head
It's me and O.C., we be low-key
Chillin' in the cribs, iced-out Roley
Chillin' with my man, his name is Phat Phillie
I'm about to get illy, L is a willy
The Blackout Rap Show
I'm cool like my man, Fat Joe
Chew MCs like tobacco
O.C

[O.C.]
Who's the fatso? No, not O
MC pro-rap, I can rip the show
With my man Big L, that's right, we representin'
Name is O.C., I'll put my foot indent in
Inside your butt like a slut on the call
MC war
Mics I storm
My man Big E is on the back of the side
MCs, pull away before I crash your ride

[Big L]
Check it out, check it out
O.C. I got your back, bro

[O.C.]
I got your back

[Big L]
And we chillin' on the show called the Blackout Rap show
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
O.C. and L could never be wack y'all
Check it out, every time I flow it's a sensation
Check it out, like

[O.C.]
