Redman: Yo, I need to wait
Mystikal: Tarantula, tarantula, boof!, handle yo' bidness then nigga

Method Man: Funk Doctor in this mother-fucker
Redman: Right he-eere
Method Man: And I'm shitty ass Meth, and we gone do what the fuck we gotta do 

[Chorus: Mystikal]
I get it started for you, I get it started for you
Soon as I get'cha cause I know that you was waitin' for me
I get it started for you, I get it started for you
Soon as I get'cha cause I know that you was waitin' for me

[Method Man]
Yo, yo, yo..
If school was pussy, I wouldn't miss a day
Big John Jay slay around the way, fish fillet
Taste the truth, ay' no more lies like Ms. Chilet
Keep my kids frost like they was born in east L.A.
Told yo' buy yo' weed by the ounce, twins lets bi-dounce
That shit they talkin' don't add up, I say what get down
Can't stop drop, can't flock, most of all I can't stop
Wreck my hand-cuffs and fightin' bullies in the sandbox
Method-cal, Mystikal, Oh yeah that's my man Doc'
Whoopin' she shoulders, WHA!, hit you with the lamb chop
Throw 'em up, slow 'em up, like the wic blow 'em up
Chick showin' butt, half of y'all ain't even know nuts
Cause I'm, I'm comin' dirty like duzum
Come on, like Buzz Lightyear lets get our buzz on
The ladies in the club, like "where the dollars at?"
They babies be at home like "where my momma at?"

[Chorus]

[Redman]
When the twins track on, you can't talk you bark on it
Doc's yo' walf on it, sometimes get lost on it 
America's Most No Time a Car woman
Timberland's and Nike Air's in the fog runnin'
We job huntin', with no I.D.'s
Plus my coke carry all the minerals I need
I'ma flow top speed, my crew fight it out
like in-door hot beat, it's war when I bleed
Sugar come here, throw that ass in the air
I leave blood guts and, broken glass everywhere
I write with "bear" hands, but I'm a gorrilla
Broke out the zoo, with Mystikal and my nigga
Fuck y'all for wrong me, I'm inside of a Ridder
With fat chicks arguing, Who's body is bigger?
I'ma get my smoke on, I'ma get my freak on
Rims get they poke on, here's some more dope to choke on

[Mystikal]
I get it started for you, Soon as I get'cha cause
I know that you was waitin' for me, I know that you was waitin' for me
So when you come you better, have your fuckin' back cause 
You know it could get ugly for me, you know it could get ugly for me
I tried to tell you but your ass didn't want to listen so bitch
Now I got to show you somethin', now I got to show you somethin'
It's capital M-Y-S-T-I-K-A-L you mother-fucker, L you mother-fuckcer
No pussy my temple band, no weed or my nerves shot, no money no concert concert
You don't get no deposit back, man these niggas can handle that
who in the fuck is you playin' wit', playin' wit'
I'm sorry it can't change, you probably can't hang
the sounds I like James, HEY!
I rap fast and kick ass, and kiss my ass
Mystikal, Redman, Method Man, nigga Yeaaaaaah!

[Chorus 2x]

[Mystikal]
Whoo! Freestyle session nigga
I'm jumpin' the mother-fuckin' south if you ain't hype, bitch</pre>
