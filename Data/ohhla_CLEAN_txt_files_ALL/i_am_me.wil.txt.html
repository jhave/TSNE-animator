Song:   I Am Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm me, I'm me, and that's all I can be
I'm me, I'm me, here's my vulnerability
I'm free and you can't stop me
I'm free and that's all I can be
Days pass, I'm tryna find who I really am
(I've been lookin')
People don't like the way I dress, or where I am at
(I've been lookin')
I dye my hair and it's not just vanity
(I've been lookin')
Your validation is just not that important to me
I'm me, I'm me, and that's all I can be
I'm me, I'm me, here's my vulnerability
I'm free and you can't stop me
I'm free, I'm me, and that's all I can be
Night falls and I find it's here I am in peace
(I've been lookin')
Making friends with spirits lost and it sets me free
(I've been lookin')
Express myself, 'cause it's my liberty
(I've been lookin')
Your validation is just not that important to me
I'm me, I'm me, and that's all I can be
I'm me, I'm me, here's my vulnerability
I'm free and you can't stop me
I'm me, I'm free, and that's all I can be
I am me, I am me, I am me
I am free, I am free, I am free
I am me, I am me, I am me
I am free, I am free
I am me, I am me, I am me
I am free, I am free, I am free
I am me, I am me, I am me
I am free, I am free
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Create yourself, redo yourself, renew yourself
Be you, do what you do
Hold your head up high, everything's gonna be alright
You're you, I'm me, let's live in harmony
Coexist with each other, love each other
Be yourself, you have to be yourself
Be real, be honest
'Cause ain't nobody got time for that
They really don't
So listen to me, listen to this song
'Cause this is real facts, that will help you move along
Yeah
That's all I wanted to say, so I love you guys so much
Hope you like this song and you know
Yolo
Misfits
