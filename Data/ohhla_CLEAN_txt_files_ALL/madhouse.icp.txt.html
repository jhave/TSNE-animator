Welcome... to the Madhouse...
Here ghost wail and moan
Skeletons rattle trying to escape there prisoning coffins (Wicked Shit)
Grimlins and skulls gasp a death (ICP Tech N9ne)
You have enterd the Mad House

Sombody open the fuckin door and let me in!
The worlds are about to get me again
Shit aint pretend I'm safer in the madhouse
Clinging to the selene like a spider
Im out of your mind like frozen fire
Razorblade fingers scratchin my neck
Lost in the maze I found a dragon barbeque in the back
A arm came out of the toilet and squaws my balls
That shirt hurt got me head but holes in the walls
I wanna see you!
I hear you!
I catch spirits and ghosts by their invisible throats
and then tear through (tear through)
Never scary boo bitch I'm a kamikaze
Swimmin through the living room watching joni and chachi
And then I realize I'm potsy trapped in the tv
Sombody changed the channel and got the better of me

Your aint never gettin in and we aint never gettin out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It dont matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
Your aint never gettin in and we aint never gettin out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It dont matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!

So many dimensions and lines except for these levels of dips and devil
Aint been alright sense the ghetto better wait for my temper settle
Cause my mind is a madhouse the n9ne fittin spaz out
Player haters dont throw stones if you grind in a glass house
Sometimes when I lash out I pass out how sick and insanse and vain can this be
Wanna fly your little head like a frisbee six six triple eight forty six ninede nine thrisde
This strange and psychopathic homie this is not disney
The madhouse continues to pin you send you psycho bitches to the back of the venue
Then you slitther when like when I'm here in you or off in you
Then my homies 2 dope and Jay do you up somthin real ???
Level of madness extasy shrooms and acid
Beats release but you cant find me in lake placid
Finnaly in missouri dissily struttin with a bad bitch
Her last kid was disastres ICP on some Mad Shit!

Your aint never gettin in and we aint never gettin out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It dont matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
Mad...House... Mad House
It dont matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!

Peekaboo anybody home? where you at?
Tryin to be sneaky creeping behind me mutha facka I saw that rail
Maybe its a mirror or a diffrent person
he was grabbin his nuts and spittin and curseing at me fag!
There somethings in this life that I fail to understand
even as even as a grown man I dont comprehend
Like how in the fuck did I walk up the stairs
and some fucking how I ended up down here
Well laughing and giggling like a little school girl
with my homies Jay and Tech aint even there Hmmm what the fuck
not a damn single bitch in this place but some ones figgin my nuts
I got it done well sittin with my pants around my ankles dry humpin my hand
Alot of mother fucker claim the insanity plead but not me
Its this house thats gone mad I'm insane as can be!

Your aint never gettin in and we aint never gettin out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It dont matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
Mad...House... Mad House
It dont matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse! (Let me out the Madhouse)
Let me out the Madhouse
Let me out the Madhouse
Let me out the Madhouse
Let me out the Madhouse
Let me out the Madhouse
Let me out the Madhouse</pre>
