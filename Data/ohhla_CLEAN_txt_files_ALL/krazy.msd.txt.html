Long time I been waitin' to get next to you
Long time I been anticipatin' the things that I wanna do
Long time I been feenin' just for one kiss
Long time I been dreamin' bout feelin' your tenderness
Sometimes I wanna grab you and just dance slow
Sometimes I really feel the urge to let you know
The feelings I have if you how deep they gom
I gotta Krazy Krush on you but can't seem to let it go
If you knew the heat I feel when our eyes meet
So hot, so deep that it gets my knees weak
So sweet, but the heat's got my heart skippin' beats
I can't hide, though I'm tryin' to be discreet

[Chorus]
You got me feelin somethin'
My heart it won't stop rushin'
You got a sister blushin'
Ooh dis Krazy Krush and
You got me day dreamin
You got a sister feenin'
You got me thinkin' bout every word you ever said
This Krazy Krush it keeps foolin' up my head

Long time it's all just been buildin' up inside of me
Long time I just wanted to touch but I just let it be
Long time I been searchin' for the words
They just don't come
Long time I been so certain dat you da one
Sometimes I wanna grab you and just dance slow
Sometimes I really feel the urge to let you know
The feelings I have if you how deep they gom
I gotta Krazy Krush on you but can't seem to let it go
You come like sunshine they way you make my heart melt
You give me flutterin butterflies I never felt
You get me nervous I cant't keep my calm
Sweatin' at the palms
Temperature rise
Hypnotised by your charm

[Repeat Chorus]

Now here we are all alone
Here we are on our own
And my emotions are running wild
I really wanna let loose but it just ain't my style
Still I gotta show you
Make you know you
Touch my soul you
Got me outta control, ooh!
I just wanna hold you
Taste your lips and get close to you

[Repeat Chorus]</pre>
