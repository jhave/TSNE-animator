[Bailiff] Order in the court
[Judge]   The courtroom asks Carlos Coy to step up to the witness stand
          Do you swear to tell the truth
          Nothing but the truth, so help you God
[SPM]     Yeah
[2-Tone]  "Three, two, one"

[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
I'll begin when I started gettin' violent, sir
Screwin' in my motherfuckin' silencer
I grabbed my steel
Then I felt the coldness
People stood around as I told this
Ferocious confession of relentless aggression
I was taught
To shoot first and then ask questions
I sold rocks, I was raised with no pops
My four glocks
Twistin' hoes like door knobs
Bitch offered me the pussy
So I took it
They call me a crook
Cause that's short for crooked
Stayin' high as hell
And drunk as fuck
You ain't down with the Mex, you can sick my duck
I mean, duck my sick
I mean, suck my dick
Don't laugh, bitch, you know what the fuck I meant
And if I ever come back to the free world
I'm a take my baby girl out to Sea World

Chorus 1: Gary Moon
Time is money (Money...)
Time obviously isn't on your side
Time is money (Money...)

[Lawyer]
Can you
Tell the jury
Exactly
What happened, on the night of December 2nd

[Verse 2: South Park Mexican]
My word is gold
Now check how the murder's told
Bring me back fourteen and my bird is sold
Learn the code
Then meet me at the service road
Now you all understand what this person owed
Servin' coke
Seemed like my purpose, so
I was the perfect mold, a gangsta you've been searchin' for
But on a further note, this cat tryin' to burn my dope
But since the day, that momma gave birth to Los
I heard them hoes, forever be first to smoke
Tryin' to jack a jacker, what's the purpose, loc
Mercy no, cause he smiles and ain't heard the joke
Now he's in his blood, tryin' to write a cursive note
I snatch his turkish rope and looked like he turned to Crow
That boy got a date with dirt in the earth below
With the worms that hoe left on an early note
I seen him run the red light, and I heard she broke

Repeat Chorus 1

[Judge]
Do you have any last words
Before I give you your sentence

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
I spent a lot of time away from family and friends
The first song I wrote, was a song called "Revenge"
Ever since then
My weapon was a pen, but I still kept a
Strap, for those devilish men
Sucker better duck-ah from the BU-BU-BUCK-ah
Do a fly-by and shoot your aunt
And your uncle
Does anybody understand the life of the trill
Pigs and snitches get along cause they squeal (Squeal...)

Chorus 2: Gary Moon
Time is money (Money...)
Time obviously isn't on your side
Time is money (Money...)
But there's no way in hell you can run from time

Repeat Chorus 2

[2-Tone]    "Three, two, one"
[Gary Moon] Time is money (Time is money...)
