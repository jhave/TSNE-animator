[Jayo Felony]
One shot to yo fuckin dome pow!
Yeah, y'all niggas don't wanna do nuttin with this here
Bitch ass niggas (One Shot)
I puts it down
Rich roll, yeah

I hit em up it ain't no stopping this, SD see me how?
Bastards released the homies, cuz we getting deeper now
They call me the "Creepa Sleepa Homie" when I'm blastin
My mission is to hurt these fools mashin assassin
I'm cold hearted with this shit, ?? my alias
Fuck a DJ suck-a-dick, they all scared to play shit
And need me to set trip, but peep how I mash
Ride on my foes while DJ Clue gets fucked in the ass
He said, "Fuck KY!" ya like it dry as ya mixed tapes
All y'all shit fake, you never retaliate
Unlike KRS, I break niggas down to they very last compound
I stomp now I keep looking around loc, but ain't no comp now
I guess it's just for tom ron blowin your mind
And keep trying to run from me but you know I'm in ya mind
But you that little bitch nigga that I'm goin to find
And we I do it these hoes got to see fou' at a time, yeah

[Hook](2x)
I C-walk and Skip
Smoke, dip, and set trip
Bitch let me put somethin on them we lips

[Jayo Felony]
Y'all rappers test me when? Cuz, test me then
Bust one and rich roll, stroll like a pedestrian
See me, think I'm bullshittin?
But you know I'm hardly kiddin
And Dulo we keep Crippin
Chronic and let ya sippin
Don't talk, move in silence and watch the fuckin phone
I wish one of you bitches would try to come up to my fuckin home
These boys is serious over turf and they rag
We should do five for two, and both your airbags
No more breathing cowards, ya leaving, ya seeing, believe me
It's easy, get rid of these marks and breath freely
And I don't want yo pussy, bitch just give me the lips
And you can sell that shit to him bitch, just give me the chips
And we gon' keep doin it big
Don't try us unless you doin it big
Can't blame me for all the dirt niggas did
We didn't really wanna go there and hurt nigga's kids
But shit, I'm like "fuck you" and got in ya hoopty and slid, bitch

[Hook](2x)
I C-walk and Skip
Smoke, dip, and set trip
Bitch let me put somethin on them we lips

[Jayo Felony]
Don't grow up to be a snitch and trade to somebody that'd fade ya
Get away wit it now, bound to catch up wit ya later
Y'all gon' swang to this, I bring it how they love it
Ya can't away from it, these bustas is scared of it
I'm known for servin niggas, they rated it thunder dog
I'm on ya like CJ Mac; they labeled us underdogs
Chuck Taylors, croaker sacks, Romeos, wallacies
If you ain't down with the camp, bitch you can swallow these
It's nothin I bring the pain
Like method migraines
A threat to the top of the food chain, I'm Wu mang
Get ya shit right, or get folded and crumbled up
Now I got the ball, nigga who dropped and fumbled what?
Its one shot kill 'em loc, I never did feel 'em
Drill 'em all with holes; kill 'em with all of those
I wasn't even gon' blast 'em till the muthafucka froze
Now I'm laughin at the party, bitch you know how it goes, I said

[Hook](2x)
I C-walk and Skip
Smoke, dip, and set trip
Bitch let me put somethin on them we lips

Yeah!
One Shot to ya dome like that, it don't stop
Jayo Felony, put it down for life
Stop bitin my shit, Crip Hop bitch
Stop runnin nigga
Yeah!</pre>
