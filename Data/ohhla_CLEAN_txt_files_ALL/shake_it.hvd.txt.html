[Heavy D]
What, what?  Uptown, get down
Check me out y'all - ya don't stop (go 'head baby)
A hear me out y'all - ya don't stop (go 'head baby)
Ya don't stop - check me out y'all (go 'head baby)
And you can't stop - hear me out y'all (go 'head baby)
Ah say what y'all (yeah go 'head baby)
I hear you talkin mama (go 'head baby)
Now feel me out boo-boo (go 'head baby)
Yeah, uhh...

From the introduction, you know my funk was all up in ya
Deep in ya creep when you walk, I dig that
Split your wig back, now grab the bedpost
Move in real close, I feel what you doin, true'n
No need no Dom P, no need no Crist'y
All you need is me, Hev D, naturally
Rough rider, "Mr. Big Stuff," up inside her
Multiple provider, the fly divider
Romeo, jiggalo, high-yellow niggaro
From the sound of Mount V., by the way of J-A
I don't play, I insist, on the back twist
Handcuffs and stuff, for those who like it rough
Go 'head baby

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it (go 'head baby)
Break it, break it (go 'head baby)
  I hear you talkin mama (go 'head baby)
  And you'll always wanna sing this Heavy D song

[Heavy D]
Whipped cream dreams I fulfill with my schemes
Down low like R. Kelly, lickin on yo' belly
Make you shake like jelly, the fat man, battin a thousand
I play it safe, carry horses just in case
Good to the, last drop da-da
Don't stop is what you tell me, anything to swell me
Private dancin, romancin the soul
On the telephone you be like "poppa come home"
Right now I got 30 minutes of foreplay
30 minutes of straight sex, 9 minutes of rest, now add that up
Mink rugs, bearhugs, hot tubs
Get lifty off the bubs, is what she loves
Go 'head baby

[Chorus] - replace "mama" with "boo-boo"

[Heavy D]
Shorty blender, fender bender, back twirler
Boo twister, officially, sexually
I'm Mr. me be always rea-dy, in ja-cuzzi
Ahh, baby, do me, do me
Fantastic, romantic, none equivalent
to my tactics, get at this, who want it?
Some get champagne, you know how they be trippin
But the joke really on you boo, cause sippin keep you strippin
(Go 'head baby) Now dance for me, keep romancin me
You got no chance with me, but you want my hands to be
(right here) Say what, and when you want it
(right now) Say what, and where you want it
(right here) Yeah, know why?
Cause you'll always be singin this Heavy D song
  [girl] Oooh, right there
That's right

[Outro]
I hear you talkin mama (go 'head baby)
And you'll always wanna sing this Heavy D song
Shake it, shake it (go 'head baby)
I hear you talkin boo-boo (go 'head baby)
Feel me out y'all (go 'head baby)
And you'll always wanna sing this Heavy D song
Shake it, shake it (go 'head baby)
Move it momma (go 'head baby)

Shake it, shake it (go 'head baby)
Break it, break it (go 'head baby)
Shake it, shake it (go 'head baby)
Move it momma (go 'head baby)
