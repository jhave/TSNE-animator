Typed by: ovadosin@hotmail.com

Bein that I'm real, I feel you need a man in your life child
Somebody black, baldheaded, plus buckwild
They call me Trick Daddy dollars
A real woman scholar
If a player's what you want, lil mama holla
Don't bother asking your friends about my benz or ends
Unless you plan on me staying in
I get my freak on, plus my back's strong,
No more sad songs for long, girl you daddy's home
I'll be your player

I need a player in my life tonight
somebody that'll treat me right
and just, hold me tight all through the night
I want a player in my life

Yeah, you can play your sex games,
kinky things but still maintain
I'm running game while you giggle off my ghetto slang
I want the best for you
First, nobody stressing you
A good girl, therefore God's been blessing you
So go with your first mind
Get it right the first time
Hang tight, 'cause early on be your worst time
You got me wanting you bad so I been watching you
And while they calling me dad, I'm simply jocking you
clocking you
Watching the threads in your dazzy dukes
Hawking you
Watching you move in your ?baka? suit
Your body too
You'll go get it, therefore you bout it boo
5'3", and I can see what you got for me
Show me some love
Kisses and hugs
Bubble baths in hottubs 
Plus baby oil back rubs
You got me heated up
Slow it down, then we can speed it up
Plus, you bringing out the freakinus
Free your mind
Let me and you spend some time
I'm on that sixty and I'm headed for that nasty nine
Come take a ride with me
If I slip, baby slide with me
And you can shift into the ride with me
And glide with me
High to the sky with me
Right here on the side of me
I'll be your player

Chorus
*call me X-rated*

I'll eat your coochie with your legs up
Down your back, up your crack, then I'll blow all in your butt
I'll suck your ass where your drawers crawl
Suck them titties and all
and make you climb the wall
You taste so sweet (ahh)
From your head to your feet
It's my treat
So baby girl just let me eat 
and call me freaky deaky 'cause I want to be your servant
And while I'm servin
I'll slap you up with syrup and butter
Average niggaz wouldn't do the things I do
I'm on my knees so please just let me taste you
Shit, my mind's in the gutter,
I'm eatin your butter 
Pink eggs and ham,
Girl you taste just like spam
I'll be your player</pre>
