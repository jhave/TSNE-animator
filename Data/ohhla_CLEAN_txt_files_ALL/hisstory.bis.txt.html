[Verse One]
Napoleon said, history is a set of lies agreed upon
Hello, is this thing on?
I'ma lay it out for you like a futon
So you can cut it out and use it like a coupon
Sometimes I wish, I wasn't wise enough
Feelin' like Cee-Lo cause I know too much
Wishin' I could rap like the rest of y'all
'Bout just bitches in the club, cars and how I ball
The whole album through, every song that's all
But no sooner than I think it, hear my conscious call
Like naw
You gotta see this through
You a part of His plan you know what you gotta do
But I don't want to
But I need to
And like it or not
I have to
Like all the other teachers and soldiers that came before
That rose then fell and gave they lives in this war

[Chorus] [x4]
My story
My glory
God took from me now it's His story

[Verse Two]
They faked the moon landin'
To remain first
So how far fetched is thinkin' 9-11 was rehearsed
Researched
Then reworked
To make you hate Arbeeb down at the mini-mart
Look for the terrorist to come from overseas
But they already here in Washington, D.C.
Scare tactics got us demonizin' Iraq
Forfeit our rights for the Patriot Act
We hand over our power to stop the villains
To the very same bastards that dropped the buildings
I ain't Michael Moore
Nutty conspirator
Hooked on sci-fi, X-Files and Star Wars
Maybe common sense ain't that common
Maybe it's harder to recognize than to solve the problem
Who we fightin'?
What we fightin' for?
And why the fuck we still over there fightin' more?

[Chorus] [x4]
My story
My glory
God took from me now it's His story

[Verse Three]
How can you erase a race entire history?
How can you rape the place that was meant for me?
How can you erase a race entire history?
How can you rape the place that was meant for me?
A rhetorical question, historical suppression
Calculated, motivated by racist's aggression
Thinkin' back as a child in school
The lessons were designed as a tool to leave us fooled
You don't believe me just take a look
Our existence starts as slaves in the history books
Used to tell the teacher, "You lyin' to me.
What about the pharaohs and the dynasties?"
The Moor's that explored and conquored the open seas
While y'all was wack, fallin' back, thought the world was flat
You motherfuckers didn't even have flavor
Hidin' behind God on missions, swear you're here to save us

[Chorus] [x4]
My story
My glory
God took from me now it's His story</pre>
