Yeah, yeah, fo' your mind
Hmmmright, let's see what we can come up with
Record after record, yeaaah, rhyme after rhyme check it

[Sadat X]
In the studio, on the first try
On the verse high only birds fly
You get out the pack like that y'all
Straight off da head (what?), let niggas know I use to wear the pro
Get three strikes yo, I used to have to court awarder
but now I got a daughter and she gotta grow
And I let her know that that ain't the way to go
My name is X, yo I'm like a puzzle when I get released
Just like I had my muzzle off, check it out yo
I can never be sold
You don't stop (and you don't quit) and you don't stop
(We're makin hit after hit after hit y'all) Ya don't stop

[Lord Jamar]
Comin straight off da head one time it's the dread Lord J
Come around the way, would you say?
One time with my crew, manifessin
Just like that, now who you think you tessin? Uhh
Brand Nubian, my crew be in effect, uhh
Get erect with the blunts and ya check
right in, one time, goin to the bank, I'm
cashin, and you know I be stashin
in the mattress, one time with the phatness
beats, I be blowin up, showin up
at shows, checkin all the hoes
Just like that and defeatin all my foes
Go for jack

[Sadat X]
Yo my name is X, yo my name is X and I was born in
the BX, I went to New Rochelle
Know my man Mark the Spark who live in the Vernon
And my man be they rhythm, dwell in Bronxdale, in the home of the
boss, goin down the block or go to forest
Keep on goin past Morris High School
Then I go down the street to Courtland Ave.
Vietnam, the male goes in Jackson
Over the bridge, on 45th to 8th Ave.
Go to 7th Ave., go to Polo Grounds
Go to Drewham, 1-0-6 all the way to 1-10
Black Puerto Rican and Dominican, check it out

[Lord Jamar]
Uhh, we're gonna show you how we live, take you straight across the bridge
to Medina where the GODs is meaner, wisdom is cleaner
Straight down on Flatbush Ave.
Some of the streets in Brooklyn'll make you laugh
Names like Myrtle and Willoughby
Things like Scurmerhorn and Classun
and funny names like that but still they got the gats rollin
Just like that that's how we be strollin
Maestro Manny and my man Big Ill, we fill blunts
Just like that we kill stunts
Guts, and what'cha want like that, we got nuts
Just like that cos it's phat, uhhh

[Sadat X]
Check it out, yeah (Like that, ya don't stop)
And I keep on goin, I keep on goin (Just like that ya don't stop)
My head keep goin on
Rob deep from mackadocious, your cut be close
With the one blade, ever since the first grade
I been a fan of the rap and I can do this
I use to watch and listen, and watch the ol' time greats
and watch em how they did things and I learned it well
I rip in New Rochelle, that's where I dwell (Uhh)
Check it out, my name is X, yo my man Mark the Spark's with me
My man Serge got the urge to splurge, he came from Cleveland
All the way from Ohio, he's gonna letcha know
can you deal with his flow, yo yo?

[Lord Jamar]
Aiyo, peace to the GODs, peace to the Earth
Peace to the birth of me and my seed Khari
It's like that in effect one time, and I'm
the black man, intelligent with the plan
Islam be the bomb, droppin on the devils
Goin to a higher level
Peace to Farrakhan and the Nation like that
Creation is black, one time, that's a fact
Original solar, I'm Lord Jamar, yes I be the
intelligent one, I be the sun shinin
Like the light in the night, but still I be bright
One time, now I recite the lessons for ya
one time, messin for ya or
check it out, without a doubt
Peace to the GODs, sincere, makin it clear
Peace to Tamiq, yeah that's the language we speak
Peace to Knowledge, he didn't go to college
but still he got the supreme mind</pre>
