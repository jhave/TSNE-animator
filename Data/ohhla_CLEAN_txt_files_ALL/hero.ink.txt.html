Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
On(on) and on(on and on), does anybody know another hero
Another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on,

[Verse 1]
Lights, camera's, action
On me I'm the main attraction
High off life, match one
This is only the beginning, act one
They don't wanna see me act up
Its kinda hard in the game full of actors
But this the real world, drinking like roofy
doubt if I remember tonight roofy

But Imma make sure they remember me
Running like I got the legs of a centipede
Nah I ain't ever trippin
I know all the rules, but I ain't never listen
I can only hear the crowd
Its gettin loud
my mom ... now

Yeah, you ain't gotta know
But they gon tell you I'm the best, when the curtains close
uh and the story goes

[Chorus]
On(on) and on(on and on), does anybody know another hero
Another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on,

[Verse 2]
Yeah (Yeah) get ready for act two
This will be the greatest show you ever sat through
New to you
But this shit is past due
Gettin money now, bills never pass due
I only did what I had to
Fast break, Ill threw me the alley oop
Uh, I maybe more like caterpoe
now I'm all on there, cantelopes

I hope ya'll happy
And when I'm done, ladies throw your draws at me
In the game I'm the star athlete
Kobe, no LeBron actually
No need for a act three
I breathe
Master piece

Raps goin Sayzy
I'm your hero but who gon save me
And the story goes

[Chorus]
On(on) and on(on and on), does anybody know another hero (Kid Ink) (Nah)
Another mindless crime (I don't see him)
Behind the curtain, (I'm the last one left) in the pantomime (uh)
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore (you don't want it)
The show must go on</pre>
