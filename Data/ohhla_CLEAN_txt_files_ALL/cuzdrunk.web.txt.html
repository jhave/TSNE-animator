Song:   Cuz I'm Drunk
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ahem, yeah
I get rowdy
Rough
Drunk
Reciting an anth
On the table all night
I'm the beer pong champ

What?
Drink until my mother fucking
Liver gets cramps
And I've lost everything
Within the pockets of my pants;
Like, shit where's my phone?
Keys?
Shit, who has my wallet?

Dude, you probably lost it
You stupid alcoholic

Ha, fuck you bitch
I weigh 160
So it only takes a few shots
To get myself tipsy

Yeah, you're more than I'm drunk
Then I move on to wasted
Black out
Find me passed out on the pavement
Slurring every statement
Vision getting blurry
Sipping 40's from
4: 40 to 2: 30

I'm dirty
Plus I ball like Michael
Get wasted like plastic that isn't recycled
Oh shit
I'm too fly
Rhyming it nice
So drunk I could get a DUI on a bike

Mix up the lime
With a little co-co-nut
Taking shots from the half filled
Solo cups
Get smashed like dropped pottery
Probably
Couldn't walk a straight line
If I had a fucking cop watching me

Walking into shit
Like I couldn't avoid it
Just looking for a girl
Tryin' to make some poor choices
But whether I get laid
Or end up in a brawl
I just blame it on the a-a-alcohol

'Cause I'm drunk
So do not play around with me
'Cause I'm drunk
Somebody take away my keys
'Cause I'm drunk
Shit I can barely even see
I think it's time to make some bad decisions..
('Cause I'm drunk)

Hey yo
I come through already blunted
Like flip cup
Who won it?
Twenty on the table, son
I'm about to make a honey
You can make it rain
But I'm 'bout to make it sunny
That means I keep my money
Buddy I'm not a dummy

Day and night
It's the kill
Looking for some honey
Got my homie Chris Webby
To make sure she ain't chubby
'Cause I drank a lot of bubbly
In the living room stumbling
Everybody lookin' lovely
But I came here from the [?]

I love the (star beefs)
And I can't control it
Might wake up with
Missing teeth
Like the hangover
I might wake up with a naked slut
From Angola
I don't know bro
I'm just saying
I ain't staying sober

So move over
For this fat bitch
Puts roofies in my cola
Cool
That's what I wanted
Wrestling sumo with (a cobra?)
There
Beware when it's time to go upstairs
Fuck a trojan
Got socks
Make sure you go up there

'Cause I'm drunk
So do not play around with me
'Cause I'm drunk
Somebody take away my keys
'Cause I'm drunk
Shit I can barely even see
I think it's time to make some bad decisions..
'Cause I'm drunk</pre>
