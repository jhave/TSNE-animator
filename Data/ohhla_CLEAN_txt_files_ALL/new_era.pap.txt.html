Yeah
Welcome to the epitome of rap
Your services are no longer needed
It's a new era in hip-hop
Thug-A, Thug-A ya know the rest
Come on

[Chorus]
It's a new era in rap, it's bout to change
They know they ain't nice that's why they claim they bang
You ever heard of Mister Cee, he use to be with Kane
Biggie Smalls, Ol' School at noon do his thang
He named the top five lyricist in the game
He mentioned Papoose, but I ain't hear your name
So I'ma quote Jay-Z, "Youse a lame," It's a shaaame
Shame, shame, shame
It's a new era in rap, it's shit to change
They know they ain't nice that's why they claim they bang
You ever heard of Mister Cee, he use to roll with Kane
Biggie Smalls, Ol' School at noon do his thang
He named the top five emcees in the game
He mentioned Papoose, but I ain't hear your name
So I'ma quote Jay-Z, "Youse a lame," It's a shaaame
Shame, shame, shame

Ima Mackie by name, a Strong by blood
Never use to have a buzz, it was what it was
Now I *bzzz* like a bee, it is what it is
Gotta make a billion dollars I got alotta kids
Ima make it to the top nonstop I ain't stoppin'
50 said, "the top feel better than the bottom,"
Lame ass niggaz tried to pop 'em
Fuck ya 40 cal gotta 50 cal now what's poppin'?
AK, chill KaySlay I got 'em
He let him gas 'em up, start 'em up I'ma drive 'em
Walk up on him like, "I don't want no problems"
Then cock back and hit 'em I was playin' possum
A gemstar's 25 cents I'ma cop 'em
So it only cost me a quarter to ox 'em
Rapper walkin' through my hood boppin'
Had to ask a question So I had to stop him
How many real niggaz from the hood who grew up around poverty
Didn't sell crack or didn't do a robbery?
Niggaz ain't live as me
Actin' like they the only ones who put in work
That shit bothers me
Ya chances of findin' that there you probably
Got a better chance at hittin' the lottery
I done sold hella crack, Moved hella packs
I done gripped hella gats, Laid hella niggaz flat
Robbed hella out-of-towners when they was in town
I done ran in hella spots, laid hella niggaz down
Had hella chains out with niggaz lamed out
Backed hella things out, had hella bang outs
I done copped hella jewels, got hella gully
I done pushed hella whips, spent hella money
Naked eyes never lie, you eye ballin' me, why?
Lookin' at me like you won't make a mistake a try
I respect your honesty cause I hate a lie
But I will forever put clothing on your naked eye
You got your money up, but man I'm not impressed
Money without respect you in debt
You fucked alot of people around soon you gone get stretched
You'll even fuck your own family, who get it next?
That's a part of the game I don't get yet
How you gone fuck your own family? Man, that's incest
But listen you ain't got no knife game we rip flesh
Get you cut up like push ups, 10 sets
Got the middle finger but I give 'em the index
Leave 'em with his wig wet
Nowadays I'm feelin' like Floyd Mayweather
He pokin' out his chest
Actin' like he brolic I don't care what he bench press
He goin' down when he get his chin checked
He gotta glass jaw, he probably wash his face with Windex

[Chorus]</pre>
