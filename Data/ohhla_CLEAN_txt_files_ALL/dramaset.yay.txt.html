[Intro]
[Block Guard] Mr. Yayo. You're free to go
So I guess this means I'll see you tomorrow, eh?
(Block guard laughs)(Eminem laughs)
[Eminem] Yeah! Haha. Guess who's home?!
Tony Yayo! Yeah! Obie Trice c'mon!
[Tony Yayo] Here we go now!

[Chorus - Eminem]
I'm a drama setter, grippin my berretta
Sippin Armeretta, man you crazy
If you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie
You can bet it, just don't get in the way
Of my cheddar, man cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go looking for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma crying cause her only son is dying
She don't know it's just your karma catchin up
Cause I'm a drama setter

[Tony Yayo]
Told you man, I'm Riker's Island Pokemon
I got COs bringing me filet mignon
But now a nigga home lookin frail in the drop (what up)
With a bitch shotgun that's inhaling the cock
I got rocks on my neck the size of bottle tops
And got glocks in the Lex so we ride behind cops (break it down now)
Broke days, we used to put water in our cereal
Now we're crossing borders just to shoot another video
It's Tony Montana on full body armor
Soning niggaz like Alfredo in The Godfather
Two shot revolver, that Dillinger shit
And the AR-15 bending your Six
We taking trips to Morocco just to tan
We smoke weed in restaurants in Amsterdam
I was worth a hundred grams, now I'm worth a cool million
I'll put money on your hairline, your dime and your children

[Chorus]

[Obie Trice]
Since Yayo is home, them A-Rs is drawn
Obie's Gorilla-Unit, fuck affiliation
We are one, it is senseless for you to prevent this
The 40 cal'll put you up under some photosynthesis
At any given instant (gunshot) another incident
You just got a glimpse of Obie and Yay's temperment
And we holding them Ks, that's why homie won't age
Isn't it that Tony's enraged, they thow him in cages
But now my nigga's loose, our crews is bulletproof
All brought to you from whom's pupils' baby blues
His short fuses put your portrait on the news
Nigga, them screws is loose when you fuckin with them Shady dudes

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]

I got fat while I was gone, but now I'm here
And yall rappers only bust shots only in fear
Chinchillas on my back, itchy fingers on the Mac
Get scrilla off of crack, get 50's shooter back
Listen homie, don't let them niggaz amp you money
Cause I got niggaz in Queens that kill for Pamper money
Move like kaiser, Jayson Williams slaughter the driver
My daughter Maniyah, know that the kid spit fire
Reality rap, nigga check my salary cap
I give guns to my soldiers with a battery pack
What you know about light planes and heavy coke
And them drugs being smuggled on them fast speed boats
It's the rap tycoon, Tony yall all know me
See me on MTV, I'm a parolee
I was out for twelve hours and went right back in
For three hots and one cot doing time in the pen

[Chorus]

[Outro]
[Tony Yayo] Yeah, nigga! Thank you Marshall
[Eminem] Haha, no problem
[Tony Yayo] We don't stop!
[Eminem] Nah!
[Tony Yayo] Save the best for the last. Talk of New York - Thoughts of a Predicate Felon, baby
[Eminem] Yeah, man
[Tony Yayo] Blue Hefner, Lloyd Banks, you know. Buck Marley, Young Buck, Curtis 'Interscope' Jackson
