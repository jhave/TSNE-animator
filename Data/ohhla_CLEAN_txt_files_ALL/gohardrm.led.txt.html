[Jay-Z]
I'm a bad M-a-r-c-y P-r-o-j-e-c-t
Ain't no other motherfucker in the rap game harder than me
I go hard and get it in like a porn star
Follow my moves you wanna make it to the top I'm on star
For new born stars
Even when the camera stop
I'ma hundred million dollar movie handle my cock
Big homie from the back block
When you first learn how to slap box
Then you even learn how to dribble the pill
Or to hand the pot, bring it back rock
Number one rule if your ass get popped
Don't try to box to the Matlock
Death before dishonor I'ma honor the code they created
Number 2 Rule and it might sound rude but yep... fuck you pay me
I drown my pain in porsches
I lost my partner to the bullshit
Still tryna hold on to my religion so
I put a couple diamonds in the crosses
Close your eyes see the darkness
That's what it's like where I'm from
No lawyers no doctors
So either I go the hardest
Or I could just call this a night
on dark nights its like I see better
on Dark Knights I'm like Heath Ledger
Even if I overdose on drugs
Motherfuckers can't kill my buzz
Wait I ain't done
I'ma freestyle this Khaled let it run
What's the hardest county in the Yayo
Cause ima go harder then they go
I'ma go harder than Baltimore
Philly gone say they can't touch the boy
Where you at Duval?
I'ma go harder than you all
Harder than New York
Turn the pro tunes in the booth off
I'ma go harder than Ye go
And Ye go hard
That's baby bro
Put some more beat on that joint 

[Chorus] 
If you could you would get rid of me 
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard 
But I wont let you get to me 
You should already figure imma go hard 
If you were as real as me 
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me 
This in my veins and it gets to my heart 
So I am, I will , I gots to go 
You got another way to live you gots to go on 
I am gettin it in until the end I got to go, go, go , go hard

[Kayne]
I ain't ever been scurred 
Never been a type to bite my words 
When I came up ya'll gave me shit 
Now I'm gunna make ya'll eat them terds 
Always said what the fuck I felt 
Gon head spit that murder I wrote 
Man I dont care what what you felt fuck you nigga I know I'm dope 
Dope like I'm comin to get my all 
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall 
Felt like niggas was stuntin on me 
Funny how I'm flyer then them all 
Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now 
Instead of me she gon go down 
Maybe I would of slowed down if I knew what I know now 
I'm stupid, yeah I know I'm dumb
It could get fuckin old but its good I'm young 
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from 
Tell me what it take to be numba one 
I guess its gon be what its gon be 
But heres one thing ya'll got to hear 
Imma tell you like george bush told me 
Fuck ya'll niggas I'm out of here 

[Chorus] 
If you could you would get rid of me 
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard 
But I wont let you get to me 
You should already figure imma go hard 
If you were as real as me 
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard 
Makin money ain't shit to me 
This in my veins and it gets to my heart 
So I am, I will , I gots to go 
You got another way to live you gots to go on 
I am gettin it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard</pre>
