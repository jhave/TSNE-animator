[Erykah Badu/background vocals] (Talib Kweli)
Yo
Ah ah ahhh.
What's the matter with these damn emcees [Kweli] (I don't know)
Come on baby if you feeling me [Kweli] (yea)
Sit down with me, roll yourself a tree (uh)
Now what the hell is going on in the industry [Kweli] (I don't know)
Now don't the people want to feel the beat [Kweli] (hell yea)
We talk about it every time we meet [Kweli] (yea we do)
Would anybody like a cup of tea (rock on, on on on)
Ba ba ba badum Badu

[Talib Kweli] (Erykah Badu/background vocals)
It's the BK emcee (Kweli)
My rhymes is found in the veins of ghetto folks who surrounded with pain
Going to clubs drowned in the liquor that's surrounding they brains
Want to be thugs on every record got them sounding the same (hell yea)
Ever since I first came to put it down in this game
These people can't quite get there tongues around my name
It's all for the good I'm still the same with or with out the fame
But I'm saying the way you got my shit pronounced, it's a shame 
(umm umm umm) The first part is Arabic (Talib)
That means the student or the seeker
I never try to be no teacher or no preacher
I just reach you through the speaker
Never beat you in the head
Cause all that preaching to the choir, yo it's dead, word (umm uhh uhh)
Then you got (Kweli), let me put you on
It means truth and knowledge from the people of the Akan
Reaching you through the song, got you rocking to the beat
Asking for Hi-Tek tracks, stopping me in the streets (uhh uhh come on)

[Talib Kweli] (Erykah Badu/background vocals)
Every body say it with me (Kweli)
Rock the party, my crew hot feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double barrel (shottie)
It's got to be my man HiTek and Kweli
Who make your (body), start the party
My crew hot, feel these two shots
Like the blast of a double barrel (shottie)
It's got to be I got Badu rocking with me (Kweli)

[Erykah Badu/background vocals] (Talib Kweli)
What's the matter with these damn emcees [Kweli] (I don't know)
Come on baby if you feeling me [Kweli] (yea)
Sit down with me brought your self a treat (uh)
Now what the hell is going on in the industry [Kweli] (I don't know)
Now don't the people want to feel the beat [Kweli] (hell yea)
We talk about it every time we meet [Kweli] (yea we do)
Would anybody like a cup of tea (rock on, on on on.)
Ba ba ba baa badu

[Talib Kweli] (Erykah Badu/background vocals)
Yea you pronounce her name Badu (Badu), love it you got to
Some try to hard to be some try to hard not to
Be just who they is, what that means that they not true [uhh uhh]
A sister put it down, let me show you how I do (duu ehh uu ohh)
Chill oc cause we still drop the ill hip hop
We stay true to what we do whether you feel it or not
When you see me rhyming or painting [uhh uhh]
I'm climbing I'm praying, I'm rising I'm surviving
I'm staying alive, y'all know what I'm saying
I come from a place where cats lust papes (Kweli) [umm uhh]
Love hate, be in the clubs late [yea]
All our beliefs crush grape (come on)
Steady rhymes takes bust ish straight
Upstate we puff grate and stay with the sticky like duct tape
Always pushing my self and steady knowing the ledge
Black man over 21 supposed to be dead (ohh uu)
Open instead cause I looked up in the face and laughed [uhh]
Give it a name money I'm having a blast (umm um ohh oo)
Ain't that right

[Talib Kweli] (Erykah Badu/background vocals)
Every body say it with me (Kweli)
Start the party, my crew hot feel these two shots
Like the blast of a double barrel (shottie)
It's got to be my man HiTek and Kweli
Who make you rock your body, start the party
My crew hot, feel these two shots (hey)
Like the blast of a double barrel (shottie)
It's got to be I got Badu rocking with me (Kweli)
