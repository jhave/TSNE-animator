"Break it down like this!"
"Break it down down like this!"
"Break it down down like this!"
"Like this!"

[Aceyalone]
Space cowboy..
Ace cowboy..
Space cowboy..
Space cowboy, the real McCoy
Electrical all over like a Super Nova astroid
Crash it back down to Earth
With a six shooter computer eyes and a beautiful view of this world
Hold on tight when you, take your flight and sooner or later
You'll have to land at Iron Horse
Gravity takes it's course and of course, the weight of the matter
Overrides the data, come back we need you in the battle

[The Soul of John Black-Singing]
As through the night you go from style to stlye

[Aceyalone]
So much room when you're circling the moon
And don't wanna come back down, trapped and doom

[The Soul of John Black-Singing]
I look into your eyes and wonder where you are

[Aceyalone]
Eyes wide shut from the inside
Only you know the ride only, you know the high

[The Soul of John Black-Singing]
But once again you're lost inside your head and never com-ing home

[Aceyalone]
Trapped up in your thoughts, caught up in the web
Hiding in your head amongst the living  dead..
("Break it down like this!")Space cowboy..
The higher I get, the lower I am
The struggle is my strength life in my own hand
Divided by the fate times the pleasure plus the pain
Minus the love and hate, nothing to gain!
I just want to live it out, figure it out, clean this house, be about
something real that got's some meaning to it
How you going see me through it? Space cowboy..

[The Soul of John Black-Singing]
Com-in home

[Aceyalone]
Space cowboy, come on back

[The Soul of John Black-Singing] {Aceyalone}
Hang on space cowboy,{Hang on} hang on space cowboy {Hang on}
Can't you hear me calling you? ("Break it down like this!")
Hang on space cowboy, {Hang on} hang on space cowboy {Hang on}
I'm coming out to arrest you, yeah

[Aceyalone]
I take ten paces, spaces desolate
Give me my piece of mind, you take the rest of it
I take no less of it, no more of it I'm sure of it
I can't lose, I'mma beats the odds, I'm gonna try to beat the Gods
I'm gonna use this Lighting Rod, I'm gonna get down on my job
I'mma landing this ship and walk, then we could sit and talk
Or make it through this darkness ("Break it down down break it down like this!")

[The Soul of John Black-Singing]
Oh once again you're stuck inside your head and never coming home
("Break it down like this!")

[Aceyalone]
Trapped in your thoughts, caught up in your head
Caught up in the web
Amongst the living dead

[The Soul of John Black-Singing]
No, no, no, no, nooo

[Aceyalone]
He'll be back

[The Soul of John Black-Singing] {Aceyalone}
