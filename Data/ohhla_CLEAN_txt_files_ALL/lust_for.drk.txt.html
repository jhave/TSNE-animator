I'm tryna do it all, tonight...
I got plans, I got a certain lust, for life...
And as it stands, everything is going as right...
as it can; they tryna shoot down my flight...
before it lands...before it lands
But you could miss me with all that...
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish y'all would fall back
But gettin rich s'pose to solve that
And these days women make offers 
and who the hell am I to say (No, no, noooo)
My ex sendin late night text 
'cause she don't know how to let (go, go, goooooo-oh-hooo...)
Uh, she in love...
And as for them pretty light-skinned models standin in the cold 
Ah yeah, they wit us...
Let them girls in for a drink...
And I'm all... in they ear...
Sayin she should be the one I see...
Everytime... that I'm here... 
but when am I really even here?
Black Surburban wit the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
but I'ma be the one to pour cement on it...
Uh...and start over
And show up in a Mars yellow tux
I don't really give a fuck and we only gettin older
So what I tend to do is to think... of today... as the past
It's funny when you comin in first... but you hope... that you last
You just hope... that it last... {*echoes*}

Throw your ones up in the aiiir...
Throw your ones up in the air for her, ooh-oh...
Throw your ones up, in the air...
Throw your ones up...</pre>
