[Verse 1: Crime Boss]
Come one, come all to see the nigga behind the trigger
Bigger then a killa murdering niggas with my little finger
Bring your sacrefices cause to me your life is minimum
Kill'em all if the price is right, shit
A heat of the spliff makes me get bucker
Me motherfucker smokin all you suckas
Isn't it that the bloodstream making me have bad dreams
All about the people I killed coming back to hung me
Kill me, help me please wont somebody save me?
The in-dough got  me mad and I aint never been like this,Gee
Blood on my hand, did I kill a man, "mayne I didnt do
I look suspicious, did you see any witnesses?"
Scopin me hopin they just might get a fuck or two
Look over your shoulders cause I just might get a fuck in you
Leave you in a ditch dead, head full of a hot lead
What in the fuck is wrong with me, why in the fuck I'm thinkin' of thee
satanic homocidal visions of me killin people
I just hope it stops right now, please dont let it be a sequel
I see myself running, police gunning, what will I do?
Chicken got me flicking telling me "stop or I start shootin, fool"
So I did, now I'm dead, here comes the bullet straight for my head...
