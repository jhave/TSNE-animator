[Yukmouth]
A motherfuckin (deezless) ? Production  ya dig, they love ya boy
Yukmouth, Devin, Ampichino, what?
They love ya boy
Yeah, Rap-a-Lot mafia, nigga
Oakland to Akron to the motherfuckin PA
They love us boy, feel me?
And free pimps see, nigga

[Ampichino]
Ampichino (cuz we love ya boy)
They love ya boy cuz I blow big dro
In Acapulco or Cancun wit six hoes
In a Pocanos blowin dro smoke through my nose
Cockin' a fo' fo', my eyes half closed
I'm duckin these tramp hoes
In KC gettin' bigga figgas like JT
In a Mercedes, in Houston, compin' some lady
In a H2 sippin' on Grey Goose and grapefruit
Smoken on catpiss ready for war like Beirut
Ampichino still be duckin the law
We got big blocks of raw
Ya'll got little rocks like Arkansas
Akron, Cleveland, Cincinnati
Brooklyn, the Bronx, New York, out to Cali
Oakland, Compton, my niggaz in Frisco
Vallejo, Sacramento, Fresno to Fillmore
Futuristic like Elroy, watchin' these decoys
I know deep boys, got street lords in Detroit

[Chorus]
St. Louis to Compton (they love ya boy)
Houston to Austin (they love ya boy)
NY and Boston (they love ya boy)
Cuz every city that I go I be thuggin boy
Portland to Oakland (they love ya boy)
Akron to Cleveland (they love ya boy)
KC to (?) (they love ya boy)
Cuz everycity that I go I be thuggin boy

[Yukmouth]
Yeah, Yuk a international star, what I pass fo'
Just like Atlanta, bitch, get ya anything ya ask fo'
Jags off the flo'
Navigation in the dash bo'
Spreewheels keep spinnin' like a cassette when it fast fo'
Nigga back and forth like Aaliyah
Call me the overseer
One night in Australia, 2 pounds of reefer
I tote around the heata, the fo' fiva
Shows in Costa Rica, I blow speakas
Stuntastic  (?)
You not a crook I rock jewels to make ya woman look
In Amsterdam smoken purple cush and (?)
In Switzerland they call me swisher man
I twist a swisher quicker then the flick of a nigga hand
Get the picture man?
Yukmouth I bring that bay thing back
I got fans from Russia to London wit regime tats
Vice lords and disciples, they love ya boy
And gang bangers never ever blame cuz ya boy

[Chorus]
From LA to PA (they love ya boy)
MIA to VA (they love ya boy)
From Atlanta to Nevada (they love ya boy)
Cuz every city that I go I be thuggin boy
Amsterdam to DC (they love ya boy)
To Japan to Sydney (they love ya boy)
Through Chi-town to Sac-town (they love ya boy)
Cuz every city that I go I be thuggin boy

[Devin]
I just left Kentucky where they love me up in Louisville
They know I'ma come back here cuz they know the dude be real
Of course DC knows the deal
I like to go go to the (?) and chill
Niggaz from everywhere tryin to do what I did
Runnin' up askin "yo, yo who is that kid?"
See me up in Denver, the Colorado Springs
Where the air is fresh and it helps me when I sing
Yo...Da...Lay... Eeh...Whoo
Got a pussy and a titty or two?
For ya boy, yep yep the travelin' man
No pressure on you nigga
See I'll a snap if I can
And off to another state
Hurry up and clean my nuts bitch, a brotha late
Call up my niggaz and tell 'em I made it safe up over herre
Nigga, you in Dallas?
Nah I'm in Missouri
Oh, over therre...

[Chorus]
St. Louis to Compton (they love ya boy)
Houston to Austin (they love ya boy)
NY and Boston (they love ya boy)
Cuz every city that I go I be thuggin boy
Portland to Oakland (they love ya boy)
Akron to Cleveland (they love ya boy)
KC to (?) (they love ya boy)
Cuz everycity that I go I be thuggin boy

From LA to PA (they love ya boy)
MIA to VA (they love ya boy)
From Atlanta to Nevada (they love ya boy)
Cuz every city that I go I be thuggin boy
Amsterdam to DC (they love ya boy)
To Japan to Sydney (they love ya boy)
Through Chi-town to Sac-town (they love ya boy)
Cuz every city that I go I be thuggin boy</pre>
