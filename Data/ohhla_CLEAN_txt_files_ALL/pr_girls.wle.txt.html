[Chorus]
Girls, I ask em do they smoke?
Ask em what do they know?
Ask em can we go? Pretty girls..
Sunshine in the air, perfume everywhere
Girls are everywhere

[Verse 1]
Thanks to the flow right now what up
A lime to a lemon remind you of the sky when I'm fuckin and we on cloud nine for that minute
Admire your style and your physique
and I aint trying to critique but you deserve a good drink, so whats up?
What you sippin on? Its no problem
Black and gold models like I'm pro-New Orleans
but shawty I'm far from a saint but I got two A-mex's that look the same way
Wale, D.C. thats me huh, my Prada say Prada and they Prada say Fela
I aint gotta tell ya they know about me huh
Come to D.C. and I can make you a believer
See baby I'm a leader they always from a Libra
And I aint trying to lead you wrong sugar I need ya
So would you please listen to what I'ma need from you
Not for tonight, but for tomorrow's amnesia

[Chorus]
Girls, I ask em do they smoke?
Ask em what do they know?
Ask em can we go? Pretty girls..
Sunshine in the air (ey shawty you gotta take your purse off for this one baby) perfume everywhere
(No matter where you from we goin to D.C. right now)
Girls are everywhere (what up)
