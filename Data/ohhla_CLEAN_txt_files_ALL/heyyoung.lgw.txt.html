[L.G. Wise]
Generation in a curse
And they feelin' sad
Too many shorties are in the hearse
Before they knowin they dad
How many sons will never know they daddys
So young and confused
So its the streets where they learn to live
So when they choose then they lose
Its like the day that 'Pac died, a place in your heart you gonna cry
I can't lie, The Lord will come and wipe the tears from yo eyes
But Jesus shed his blood to save a thug
Then they got us bustin slugs
Them haters bust his head, but he still showed 'em love
Its the thugs that need yo love, its the thugs that need yo hug
Lord we need you on des streets, thats why we dying from des slugs
So me and the Outlawz, we come father asking you for forgiveness
So you can come into our heart, and help us savin our children
Now hey young world, from Lauderdale to the Bay
Now hey young world, from MIA to L.A
Now hey young world, from Carolina to VA
Lord hear these thugs crying and come and save us today

[Chorus]
To all my shorties on the blocks (hey young world)
To all the thugs slangin rocks (hey young world)
Even if you on lock down
All my ladies the world is yours

[E.D.I.]
These days it don't pay to play, you better make your way
Cause life ain't guaranteed to you young dudes in the wildlife
Still livin childlike
Criminal minds of the juvenilles up lovin to wild out
Born with an anger from where, he don't even know
400 hundred years of oppression, and it's bound to show
They said he murdered his teacher on the last day of school
One shot from a 22, left them blue
What to do, hey young world don't believe what they tellin you
you can prevail livin in hell, you ain't a failure
Hey young world I know the times is hard
But beleive in the Light it'll get you out of the dark
Have hustle have smarts, must of all have heart
Never let 'em see you shed a tear, My God, have hustle have smarts
Must of all have heart, and never let 'em see you shed a tear
Yeah, Yeah

[Chorus]
