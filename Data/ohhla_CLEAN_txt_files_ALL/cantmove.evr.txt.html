Song:   I Can't Move 
Typed by: EattWhtysWhytyFrd@aol.com 

Watching the sun shine, peaking over the sky line 
Thinking I gotta get mine, gotta try at least one time 
Want to get near it, close enough to fear it, close enough to hear it 
Close enough to say that I looked it in the eye, then I turned away 

Chorus 

And I'm not scared, but I can't move I'm not scared, but I can't move 
Hangin' out on a weeknight, looking out on the street light 
Getting into some fistfight, trying to cling to my birthright 
Want to get near her, close enough to smell her, 
Close enough to tell her 
All the things that I want to say, then I looked her in the eye, 
Made her run away 

Chorus 

And I don't care, but I can't move I don't care, but I can't move 
Laying up at the Soho, looking out of my window 
Pulling back on some indo, watch the breeze as the wind blows 
Want to get near it, close enough to hear it, close enough to fear it 
Close enough to say that I looked it in the eye, then it turned away 

Chorus 

And I'm not scared, but I can't move I'm not scared, but I can't move </pre>
