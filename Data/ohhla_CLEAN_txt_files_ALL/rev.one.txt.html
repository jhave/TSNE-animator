(Verse one)
Heaven must be missing an angel
Or the devil counted one demon short
Knock knock who's there. Nobody, go to hell
People go away. Don't bother me today
The statue of libertys mouth is three feet wide
The earth will open up and swallow everyone inside
But my band will break up just to have a reunion tour
But only if the crowd wants more
I get drunk and make beautiful things fight each other
I get drunk I make pretty things get ugly
I make dead things come alive and die twice
So precise
Everyone's worried about saying something they'll regret
But let me out of this ugly shell and represent
I've grown out of my physical presence
I never let people know my real emotions
Now are you part of a musical revolution?
I can drink my way out of an ocean

(Chorus)
Liquid love, baby, never cheat on me
Let me watch you dance
Liquid love, baby, looks like a bottle
Let me watch you dance your way to my liver
(2x)

Don't be afraid to admit your down falls
We all got 'em and I think that I've got 'em all
It was my homie that I used to hit trees with back in the day
Lets get some beer that's all that we say
I have more dirt on you than you have on me
Give me a shot and put it on my tab
A picture is worth a thousand words mad
A thousand words is only worth a memory
Don't do stupid stuff just to get attention
Like the other suckers with fake addictions
Don't be the leader of my fan club
at the Walrus One convention
Appreciate 2 o'clock and all of its lessons
She wants to meet a man and squeeze out his kids
But downing Colt 45's that's all he ever did
You will never amount to nothing

(Chorus)
Let me watch you dance
Liquid love

(Verse one again)
I'm always woried worried about saying things I'll regret
But let me out of this ugly shell and represent
I've grown out of my physical presence
I never let people know my real emotions
You are now part of a musical revolution
I can drink my way out of an ocean

(Chorus)</pre>
