[Cee-Lo]
Now everybody that's grown got skeleton bones they got hidden away
Yes y'all there's a freak in us all, yet some choose not to say
You can't let those who ain't yet, make you they lil' ball of clay
Be free and express yourself, nastiness comes naturally
Listen to me now
It could be the way I wanna freak a song, tattoos, or the way I dress
Or it could be; I wanna walk my way and refusin to follow the rest
Or when people haven't been where you been
and they say you still going too far
Or when you wit ya girl and
Pull over and fuck somethin in the back of the car

[Hook]
I'm a freak!
A closet freak!
A freak!
Awwww a freak!

[Cee-Lo after each pause in hook]
I'm so excited, y'all all invited
Oh I'm a freak, yes I'm a freak, and just can't fight it
I'm so excited, go on and say it
If you a freak, say you a freak, don't try to fight it

[Cee-Lo]
You got to let the music freak your mind
Otherwise, it's the blind leadin the blind
You know a good freakin is hard to find
Get on the floor mama and bump and grind
Ain't nuttin wrong wit it, if you want it gon' get it
But it ain't no fun if you just freakin all alone with it
I'll turn you on to it - if you want you gon' do it
All you got to do is find somebody like you

[Hook]
A freak!
A closet freak!
A freak!
Awwww a freak!

[Cee-Lo after each pause in hook]
I'm so excited, go on and say it
Oh I'm a freak, yes I'm a freak, and just can't hide it
I'm so excited, go on and say it
If you a freak, say you a freak
(Wait a minute, where the God-damn horns?)
