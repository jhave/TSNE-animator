Song:   Relationships
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x2]
Relationships, friendships
To tell you the truth all that shit irrelevant
Loyalty, business
Add em both together equals super rich

[Verse]
Loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty for Free Band royalties
Young Scooter, I'm ballin see
A boss man, I own my own royalty
Loyalty, friendships
You know that's not how my niggas kick it
We family, business
Playa how it go? Real street shit
Relationships  I ain't with it
I don't need a gun, they on that bullshit
What you talkin bout? That's irrelevant
I ain't never met, you must be snitchin

[Chorus: x2]
Relationships, friendships
To tell you the truth all that shit irrelevant
Loyalty, business
Add em both together equals super rich</pre>
