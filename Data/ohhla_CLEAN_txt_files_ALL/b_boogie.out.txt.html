[Edi] (chorus)
Mic check... uhu
Bitch ya heard me
Let's get down right dirty
Bounce that ass and let me see if you worthy
Work them hips until I loose my cool
Then Imma introduce ya ass to my crew

[Young Noble]
You can shake that ass if you want to girl
I can break that ass if I want to girl
You can ride the dick if you need to girl
Pay you 68 bitch when I need to girl
I only spend cash when I need too ma'
You need to give the money some
Plus me too ma'
You hit the blunt once
Time to pass it bitch
I hit ya cunt once
Now she love my dick
These honey's got a problem
Coming out they clothes
I was spittin' at the hoes
Now they gettin' at Nobe
They swallow all the nut
Straight loving the taste
Mouth better then the pussy
So Im fuckin' her face
She aint bring a toothbrush
So it's cum on her teeth
She know the routine
Yo I nut and I leave (I'm gone)
In between these songs gettin' head in the booth
Tell the truth
You muthafuckas better then who?

[Edi] (chorus 1)
Baby ya heard me
Let's get down right dirty
Bounce that ass and let me see if you worthy
(bounce bounce bounce)
Work them hips until I loose my cool
Then Imma introduce that ass to my crew

[Young Noble] (chorus 2)
Let's do the Boxspring Boogie baby all night long
As naked with my Tims on
Come along
Do the Boxspring Boogie baby all night long
As naked with my Tims on
Bring it on

[Young Noble]
She ain't know I had plans
So I'm beatin' it up
Anything you got for me girl
I'm eatin' it up
Talkin' bout how she gon' work that shit
I need ya legs behind ya head to insert this dick
My nigga Reef next so what's fuckin with that
She like to lay on her stomach so I bust on her back
As naked with my Tims on layin the wood
I got hoes in the hills plus some in the hood
Some bitches talk slick but cant take the dick
Noble bone so ya know you cant break the dick
We was all alone so you know she aint the dick
She like pussy but she know aint no mistaken dick
I talk to 'em smooth then Im fuckin 'em rough
Let's do the Boxspring Boogie baby
Thuggin' it up
I talk to 'em smooth then Im fuckin 'em rough
Let's do the Boxspring Boogie
Is you with it or what?

[Edi] (chorus 1)
Baby ya heard me
Let's get down right dirty
Bounce that ass and let me see if you worthy
(bang bang bang)
Work them hips until I loose my cool
Then Imma introduce that ass to my crew

[Young Noble] (chorus 2)
Let's do the Boxspring Boogie baby all night long
As naked with my Tims on
Come along
Do the Boxspring Boogie baby all night long
As naked with my Tims on
Bring it on

[Young Noble] (verse 3)
My nigga Quimmy Quim said he like to piss on hoe's
My nigga Milion said he make 'em touch they toes
Bitches get slick on some K-Y shit
Then I turn to Aaron Hall on some Bye-Bye shit (Bye Bye)
Ya wonder why a muthafucka call ya bitch
Ya wonder why a muthafucka called cha friend
I aint got time for you playin' them games
Let me work it past ya time so you could play with ya brain
Nobe aint shit they be tellin they friends
These hoe's aint shit and I'll tell 'em again
On some real life trick shit
Hookers and dimes
You be diggin' in ya pockets
While she look in ya eye
My big homie told me dont trust that bitch
I told 'em: "hell nah I dont love that bitch"
I got a wife and a kid so Im cuttin' you off
You could brag to ya friends you was fuckin a Law

[Edi] (chorus 1)
Baby ya heard me
Let's get down right dirty
Bounce that ass and let me see if you worthy
(bounce bounce bounce)
Work them hips until I loose my cool
Then Imma introduce that ass to my crew

[Young Noble] (chorus 2)
Let's do the Boxspring Boogie baby all night long
As naked with my Tims on
Bring it on
Do the Boxspring Boogie baby all night long
As naked with my Tims on
Bring it on</pre>
