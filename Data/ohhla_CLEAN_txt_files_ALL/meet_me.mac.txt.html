[In The Background]
UHMMMMMMMM
I hope your all 'bout it, don't be playin' no games
Nigga tryin' to do something, for real

[Chorus]
You can meet me at the hotel S.A.P.
I Hope you got your girls cus I got my dawgs with me (4x)

Now IM gon' be in room 7-3-0 cus IM a Leo
I like 'Emm black brown and Creole, you know my stee lo
Soon as we touch down in your town, peep it
My first question, is were dem gimps at, ain't no secret
We some G's and we like to get pleased, with no beginners
When you finished with me, my nigga forty got winners
Big swolls, he fresh off parole, he like 'Emm slim with gold
Big Herb he like thick with a mini-skirts
I got my camouflaged drawz, and my rubbers
Make sure you bring a extra gimp for my lil' brother, it's goin' down
I know you got your soldier shit on
Cus you been talkin' you bout it on that phone, you heard me

[Chorus 4x]

[??]
So you saw me on stage, girl you in a rage
Tryin' to turn tha page, before I put you in this gimp cage
What's you age, 21, HELL YAH
Tell ya moms' to watch your son, tell your man tonight that you can't
come
I'm a virgo don't pass me, they say I'm nasty
Come to room 19, lets break my wet dream
My fuck spot, ask them hoes in Augusta how to serve rock (ha ha ha)

[Magic]
Were's your whole fleet, it's Mr. Magic, tha Casanova
Known for my smooth way for askin' you bitches over
Would you like some Dom Perignon, while I'm smokin' my ?cong?
Cus I'm thinkin' of takin' the pussy home baby
I ain't trippin', fuck I trick on the sleek
Just a flash of my ?C-Nose? And your ready to get bent
This experiment, I wanna see how loud you can scream
I fill your biggest dreams in room 8-16

[Chorus 4x]

[Mia X]
It's goin' down room 7-3-0, at 7:30
I play the game boy, low-down and dirty, you heard me
This nigga told me to bring my girls, but I ain't got no friends
Instead my head I'm goin' solo for dough though and jackin' ends
He think he gettin nasty, he gon' be assed out
?? ?? Beat it real quickly then he pass out
I gets my shine on diamond studded pussy decor
And rhyme bitch ass line go fuck a storm door

[Magic]
Now baby girl, I got a 8:30 flight
So uhh, if this is goin' down, it's gotta happen tonight
And baby doll, don't fight (don't fight) it's kinda tight
Look, you know what I like, AIGHT
I'm a soldier, you probly knew that, so were your crew at
Me and my niggas wanna see how yall hoes do that
I'm tryin' to do something, he tryin' to
Were they at boo, say you, you tryin' to do something too?

[Chorus]
Let's get it on we wanna bone
Got a case of Dom Perignon
And a half a zone
So lets get it on (4x)
