[Daz talking]
Yeah... right about now
I'm most definetly in the house
I want the party people to move left to right right to left
Yea, y'all know how we do this
Yea, c'mon, put yo hands in the air

[Daz verse]
Now drop to yo knees
And picture me diggity Daz flowin through the breeze
My style scretches from miles from miles, check my files
10 years in the game I been puttin it down
I loc with the finest
Y'all love the way that I'm rhymin and comin with precision
And you know I'll be grindin
Cause I'm a dogg house dogg pound chittey chow pow pow
Y'all know how we do it (you know we put it down)
Yea, they loving these hits for years
When the smoke clears Diggy Daz appears
I'm here for whatever never the less I got the remedy
to get the party pure energy before the next century
Swoopin down the block in a drop-top
I kept it coming with hit rocks and I don't stop
Movin the traffic in my zone it's havoc
I take caution going for miggy miles and miles
Flippin the wheels off the mother
Pump it up for the summer, I keeps it comin
I'm in the undercover scraping the back against the craw
And this is for my G's and my locs and doggz

[Soopafly chorus]
Dogg catcha, dogg catcha, dogg catcha
Dogg catcha, dogg catcha, dogg catcha
Dogg, dogg, dogg
Why must I be like that, why must I chase the cat, chase the cat

[Daz verse]
So you betta beware of my crew
Raid and blued up get chewed up
Still ya are brand crew get bruised up
My duu'z up users who us
You're just a phony ass rapper you can't fool us
My tools to rush ya (I'm the first ta get it off)
My crew'll rush ya (I'm the first ta set it off)
I'll ride this way and that way as you'll ways
Bump whut they say I do thangz my way
As now, forever elited please believe it
Ain't no busta in me homie I keeps it G
And see it like I see it the American dream
To be a Dogg Pound Gangsta on tha winning team
My scheme my plan and my plot take effect
Wit no sweat, lovin this gangsta hits
Lock it up hold it up and roll it up
Big faces homie everywhere that we showin up
You know us, soon as we step in tha house we gon'turn this mother out
Live it up to tha fullest homeboy you know I luv 'em all
And this is for my G's and my locs and doggz

[Soopafly chorus]

[Daz verse]
Now just wave your hands up in the air
Wave em all around like you just don't care
Hold up, wait a minute
All my thugs getting gangsta with it
Who cares what they say
I'ma do things my way, anyway anyhow
I'ma keep putting it down
Let my feet in this industry
Remember me the D-A to the Z
Going down the history, you mention me
Homie, I'm gangstafied
And the haters hate the vibe and the gangsters decide
It's time to get out to expand to spread out
Get your gun homie D-A-Z put some head out (you laid out!)
That's what I'm all about
Burn the rubber homeboy givin it up no doubt
Fo sho, the bass-bumper, straight party jumper
Ain't no busters allowed
This parties ain't for suckers
Y'all want this party started live (party started)
Y'all want this party started quickly
Y'all want this party started live (party started)
Y'all want this party started quickly

[Soopafly chorus]

All my homies go, woof woof
Ladies, meow meow
All my homies go, woof woof
