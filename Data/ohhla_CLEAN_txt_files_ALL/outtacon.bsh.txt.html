[Baby Bash *slowed down*]
I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ
I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
It was midnight
I got the booty call
She said, "I'm at the club"
So I threw on my drawers
I'm lookin' throwed in my fit, candy coat on my whip
The popos all on my tip, but man, I don't even trip
Sent me a dirty text
So I texted her back
Scooped up the Stooie boy, cause he had a purple sack
And now we gone with the wind, and so, we poppin' again
We rebel rockin' and rollin', this club is outta con-, outta con-
Uh, uh

Chorus: Baby Bash (Pitbull in background)
Outta control, she got me outta control (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
She make you go crazy when she out of the floor (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
She know the DJ, he's on some Serato
He date them models
He crack them bottles (Everybody say)

Hook: Pitbull
Fellas, what you ladies like
Money, money, money
Ladies, what you fellas like that
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Money (Money)
It's outta control
She showed that monkey (Whoo!)
It's outta control

(Verse 2)
I'm double fisted now
Under a strobe light
It's lookin' like a movie, but it's feeling so tight
Now I got one in the cage, and I got two on the stage
I got a waitress on the under, tryin' to give me some face
They play some Lil' Wayne
Mixed with some T-Pain
They mashed the Journey record, now they dropped some Coldplay
And now they playin' my song, the girls are showin' they thong
We rebel rockin' and rollin', this club is outta con-, outta con-
Uh, uh

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook

[Baby Bash *slowed down* {*sped up*}]
I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ
I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ
{I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ
I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ}
I don't need no love, all I need is the {DJ}, DJ

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook

[Baby Bash]
It's outta control (It's outta control...)
It's outta control (It's outta control...)
It's outta control (It's outta control...)
It's outta control (It's outta control...)
It's outta control (It's outta control...)</pre>
