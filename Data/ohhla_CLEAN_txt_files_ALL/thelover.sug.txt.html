[Master G]
I am the king of the rappin thing
But love, is really my game
And when it comes, to gettin the finest chicks
I put all the other rappers to shame
The ladies scream when I'm on the scene
They love my 280-Z
And when the party's over they stand in line
to go home with the Master G, ha ha hahhh

	This is for the lover in you
	The lover in you, I know she's in there somewhere
	This is for the lover in you
	Ah for the lover in you...
	Whoaaaah honey, can't you see, yeah
	It's the lover, in me
	Who wants to make love... 
	... to the lover in you
	The lover in you
	To the lover in you

Don't be misled, by what I said
There's one thing beyond a doubt
Inside every rapper there's a lover
who's tryin, to get out
So let's make a start, unlock your heart
This is, the place to be
And as we're movin, to the music groovin
You'll bring out, the lover in me... sing it gang

	This is for the lover in you, the lover in you
	I know she's in there somewhere
	This is for the lover in you
	Ah for the lover in you...
	Whoaaaah honey, can't you see, yeahh
	It's the lover, in me
	Who wants to make love...
	... to the lover in you
	The lover in you
	To the lover in you...
	Won't you give her a shout
	Tell her to come on out
	Got a job, for her to do
	You know I'm talkin about...
	... the lover in you
	The lover in you, the lover in you...
	The lover in you, the lover in you

[Wonder Mike]	If there's a party in any town
		You know the Sugarhill Gang, will throwdown
[Master G]	With yours truly, the Master G
[all three]	And the brothers who rap so sensuously
[Master G]	It's got to be mellow
[Wonder Mike]	Got ta be right

[Wonder Mike]	And love, is what we're talkin about
[Big Bank Hank]	So c'mon gang, ah let's take it on out
		Everybody now
