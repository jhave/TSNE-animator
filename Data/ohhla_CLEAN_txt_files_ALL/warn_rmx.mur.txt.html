[Verse One: Uncle Murda]
I get money I get money, OOOH I'm gettin paper

That's my baby girl right there, OOOH she with her friends
I'm a dog I ain't shit, I'm a wind up hittin her friends
Banger a Outlaw, OOOH I'm like Pac
But I ain't die after the second time I got shot
I got greasy bars OOOH I'm talkin reckless
Got niggas that's beefin with each other on the same record
Look at Jeezy look at Ross, OOOH they fallin out
It's not just New York they beefin with each other in the south

Today I'm feelin ignorant zoomin down Lenox

Hear the voices in my head like OOOH do not hit it
