[Chorus 2X: Twista]
I ain't that nigga
I just thought I'll let you know
When I'm rollin with a black fo'-fo'
I ain't that nigga

[Twista]
Naw I ain't a +Gangster+
but kick it with board members and governors that love Larry Hoover
Niggaz that'll do ya
Down for my rifle over Disciple now have your momma screamin out "Hallelujah"
And no I ain't a Vice Lord
but I kick it with niggaz that bring that shit to the left
CVL, love the PL, and thug folks that love low
Down with my clique to the death
And naw, I ain't a Black Peace Stone
but when I was gettin production from Villain we was chillin
Southside, swole brothers with long-ass braids
Some real niggaz stackin millions to the ceiling
And naw I ain't a Soul
but got into it with Dolla and Rock, picnic with Jack Bobo
Knew all them niggaz when my raps flow slow
before I was rollin black Benzes on black mo'-mo's
And I got plenty friends and relatives 
that still be all up in the mix
Out ch'ere up in the streets, well fuck this rap shit
Nigga I got guns, you ain't gon' do shit
I ain't gon' be frontin and fakin and actin petty all in my music
Uh-uh, that's too lame
When it's on it's on, I pop a nigga when you gone you gone
You finna be wiped off the earth like a memory, what's dude name? {*echoes*}

{*guns cock, BLAM!*}

Huh, naw I ain't a killer
but I'll stank a motherfucker while I'm hooded if he pull it
Make a nigga bite the bullet
Hit him with the chrome cause I gotta show it's on to the fullest
And naw I ain't chief
but I'm a motherfuckin beast when it come to runnin in the streets
Ain't been on it in a minute cause a nigga gettin money
When I do it's cause a nigga gotta eat
And naw I ain't solid
but I got the utmost respect for a nigga if he hollered
Or if he ride in a V6, I know he be the shit
To the real G's I gotta pay homage
And naw I ain't hard
but on God I'll push a nigga shit back and leave him scarred
Get the infrared beam and then go and steal 'em, steam 'em
Stank a nigga then go put the car in my garage
I spit crack, you gotta pardon my barrage
of lyrics I'm throwin discardin the façade
The thieves wanna be thugs try to put on for the streets on beats 
but got no heart up in the mob
Quit lyin, you the metaphorically speakin motherfuckers 
that want it with real niggaz that's out ch'ere
Give a description of a helluva gun
but you don't really wanna feel it from real triggers that's out ch'ere {*echoes*}

{*guns cock, BLAM!*}

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Naw, I ain't a player
but in my city all the bitches honor me like I'm the mayor
Devastatin rhyme sayer
but if you wanna make it bigger than words I got a sprayer
And naw I ain't a pimp
But peel a hoe for a fimp and I walk with a limp
While I be smokin on that hemp
And at the party bitches sayin "Look at him, look at him!"
And naw, I ain't no mark or no coward
Come at me you gon' get your lil' heart devoured
We don't buckle easy to threats
We be comin after necks for tecs for sex, money and power
Been doin it big for so long everybody around us talk shit
Can't do nothin but hate, off the money we makin
We don't come up off of rappin we comin up off bricks
You lil' soft bitch {*echoes*}

{*guns cock, BLAM!*}

[Chorus]

{*BLAM!*}</pre>
