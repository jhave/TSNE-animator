[Ja Rule]
Uh, yeah 
It's Ja Rule baby
It's  E-Dub
Yeah
Def Squad
Uh
Y'all motherfuckers think it's a game right?
Get da name right
R-U-L-E baby
My shit is airtight
Compressed, dead all da non-sense
Pass da 4-5th and load up the cartridge
E Reved up da 6 
We about to blow out like bitchez wit bad kidz
Once u feelin da slugz hit 
Datz as real as it gets
Then you wonda
Why da quake can come from unda-neath, while you figure it out 
You on da streetz
Laid out wit da gun still stuck in yo mouth
Fuckin wit Ja is suttin Niggaz fearfully doubt
Cuz I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, god may I ask from yo prayer so my soul don't die
These is real tears I cried
And dreamz don't lie
When they tell me dat I'm doin good in da devilz eyez
But I preach to Im 
Be dat same, Nigga put da heat to Im
Askin E Dub what da fuck you wan do to Im

[E-Dub]
E-Dub and Ja
An eye for an eye, Gat for Gat
Peep Game, Cover the Mic and Spit Flamez
Two cats who come strapped, self contained
Ain't shit this raw since Big Daddy Kane
Heavyweight, I knock a Nigga out in two
Put him to sleep, see dreamz and swear it wasn't true 
Look at you, lame, I'm iller, rhyme killa,
Comin thru like da return of Godzila

Chorus: Ja and {E-Dub}
Now can I tell ya 
E and Ja top doggz, def squad, 
Fuckin wit us is like, {suicide}
Bow down, real niggaz on da move comin thru blazin you
Cuz we are {livin l-i-i-fe} 
Thug style, Hennesey,  Blazin treez,
Gettin g's, indeed, Cuz we will {do or d-i-i-i-e}
Right now by any meanz
{Words is bond word is bond}

[Ja Rule]
Ain't nobody touchin da ground dat I walk on  
My Love, It's just so strong
If you crossin me you dead wrong
And you know cuz you feel it in yo heart nigga
And you don't sleep cuz yo soul might fall apart nigga
If you feelin me now,
The strenght got you settlin down
We puttin in work
In otha words we puttin in roundz
Take two for now 
Ja and E-Dub
Strictly for the love
We fuck hoez and bust slugz, Nigga
Why in da world would you put me in da position
To put niggaz out of commision, love, willin and wishin
Cuz I'm feelin the need to cut off da air dat you breathe
By any means it's Ja and E no in beetweens

[E-Dub]
Now we move agile, 
You and yo niggaz is fragile
Like glass and UPS boxes, Shit watch this
Still housin, The year 2000's now
So fear this or we in yo face niggaz, BLAAU

Chorus: Ja and {E-Dub}
Now can I tell ya 
E and Ja top doggz, def squad, 
Fuckin wit us is like, {suicide}
Bow down, real niggaz on da move comin thru blazin you
Cuz we are {livin l-i-i-fe} 
Thug style, Hennesey,  Blazin treez,
Gettin g's, indeed, Cuz we will {do or d-i-i-i-e}
Right now by any meanz
{Words is bond word is bond}

[Ja Rule]
Now what I love is to see my niggaz on top
And I feel that we can't be stopped
And my life don't mean shit to me
But my life gon make history
Feel me, a nigga ain't supposed to be 
As deadly, and you ain't even close to me 
Respect me, cuz we livin dangerously
Luv me, cuz y'all cant even FUCK wit me

Chorus: Ja and {E-Dub}
Now can I tell ya 
E and Ja top doggz, def squad, 
Fuckin wit us is like, {suicide}
Bow down, real niggaz on da move comin thru blazin you
Cuz we are {livin l-i-i-fe} 
Thug style, Hennesey,  Blazin treez,
Gettin g's, indeed, Cuz we will {do or d-i-i-i-e}
Right now by any meanz
{Words is bond word is bond}
