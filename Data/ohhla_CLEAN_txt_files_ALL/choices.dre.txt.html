Ah, yeah
Ah, ah
Ah yeah

[Verse 1]
Time and time again knew our relationship
I wonder what's going wrong
To make us go through such pains and heartaches
But still I know my love is so strong for you (Ah yeah)

[Chorus]
Should I love you
Should I leave you
So many choices (Oh so many choices)
Choices baby
So many reasons why (So many reasons why)
I could have you near me (Oh yeah)
So many choices

[Verse 2]
I don't understand why you wanna take me through these changes
No, no oh
I can't decide what to do when it comes to me and you
Because my love is true
Where do we go from here, where do we go
I can't help but wonder, I can't help it baby
Do we belong together, oh oh
Your love I feel can be a lot

[Chorus]
Should I love you (Should I love you)
Should I leave you
So many choices (Oh baby you giving me so many choices)
Choices baby
So many reasons why (So many reasons why)
I could have you near me (Oh yeah yeah)
So many choices (So many choices)

Should I love you
Should I leave you (Should I love you, should I leave you)
So many choices (Oh baby yeah, yeah, yeah)
Choices baby
So many reasons why (So many reasons why)
I could have you near me (Oh baby yeah yeah)
So many choices (Got me waiting)

[Verse 3]
All alone, I don't wanna lose your love
On my own, I just can't breathe without you
Wanna be, got to have you in my life
Can't you see, we can make it if we try

[Chorus to fade]
Should I love you
Should I leave you (Ah, ah)
So many choices (I don't know what else to do boy)
Choices baby
So many reasons why (A million reasons why)
I could have you near me (I need you baby)
So many choices (Oh should I love you)

Should I love you (Should I leave you)
Should I leave you (Ah, ah)
So many choices (So many choices yeah, yeah)
Choices baby
So many reasons why (Ah, ah)
I could have you near me (Oh yeah yeah)
So many choices (Ah yeah)
Should I love you...</pre>
