Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
More money, More bitches
More work, More haters, Equals more snitches
More digits? No. More commas
Me affiliated with trend setters equals more drama
Weezy Obama, th-that's my co-signer
You see Osama, in my persona
Steamin' like a sauna
Sick I need a doctor
Stap you before I drown you
Now you just another Red Lobster
Where the bitches at?
I need a head doctor, nice thick and red
Bitch you fuckin' with a top-shotta
T-t-top dolla'
Nigga young money
We got old money
Don't play dumb money
All black whips
All red Flags
Put that red dot on yo head, Play head tag
Real niggas missin, When I'm preachin' to 'em
Now we all know money talks cause' I'm speakin to 'em

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
But I ain't speakin' to 'em
I call my guns jumpers, Cause' my bullets just leapin' to 'em
All you boys busters
So soft, Bet the wind blew 'em
I claim flame, I am just rekindlin'
My intuition is get paid
But this glock will knock you back to 5th grade
I... School you nigga, but none you's get A's
Got a bitch who won't stop, til' everyone of us get laid
All you niggas is son-of-a-bitch made
And if ya girlfriend utta, I cut her like switch blades
(Yeah)
We ride like roller blades
Now gone give me head til' it fall off of you shoulder babe
I smoke all day, that's why I'm so away
Mentally mind blow, now gone and blow away
Yaw niggas just super fake
I put you niggas on mute, Then I mutilate
(Yeah)
I mac like the computer say
My hoess coop-er-ate, I mean cooperate
I don't know how to say
Oh but I gotta say
I just 4, 5 away to ain't no one alive to say
That I 4, 5'ed away
Then I drive away
Paper chasin' money runnin like ondalay
Better find a way
Better not be M.I-way
I take it farther than zembabway
I make it harder for the wimps
I stay on they necks no lettin up
And I tote that can opener, Make me bust yo 7-up
Heaven up
Hell down
Man down
Gayle down
And I keep that hammer, Do you wanna get nailed down?
Better kneal down
Cause' I am the god
I am the harder mu'fucka to try and before
My diet is shaw
I ryer than wall
Fightin' 'em all
Bitin' 'em all
Giant or small
I am a dog
I can smile at dumb bitches and brighten 'em all
I am a hog
Rightin' all
I just lay that pipe and I'm off
Call me plumber
And give your girl my number
Humbra
I am a bumble... bee on the humble
Your girlfriend want my pickle and my cucumber
Tell yo boy-frann I'll turn him to a vegatable
Break a nigga down like a decimal
I'm tellin' you
I'm very cool
Non-less a fool
Fuckin' up my revenue
I tote that whatever dude
I shoot at whatever dude
Just bought a lambrogini mar-cee-el-lo-goo
And my guuuh' from the bay say it's hella cool
Where's the heli-pad? My helicopter land
I shot the man, If I'm not the man
Do I go in? Or I go in?
I'm not yo friend, I'm not yo kin
I'll make your brain come out your chin
Been in the game since the beginning
I'm all about winning
I look down I see them, When I look up I don't see any
You pooh like winnie
Do I diddy?
I just left, But your boo right with me
And I'm from never do right city
But don't get me wrong, Young money I'm gone...</pre>
