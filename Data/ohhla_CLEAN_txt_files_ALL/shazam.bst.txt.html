Everybody get down huh 
Everybody get down huh 
Everybody get down huh 
Huh huh huh huh, Shazam! 

I sneak a chicken tikka 
Marsala at a gala event 
I represent that's stupid that's for sure 
You be like "Oh yeah Adam, real mature" 
I'd like a lettuce, tomato and Munster on rye 
All this cheese is gonna make me cry 
Gorgonzola, provolone 
Don't even get me started on this microphone 
Blowin' up like my name is Joe Bazooka 
I'm a super-dooper MC party pooper 
On a track so slick it'll make you feel all queasy 
Make you do like Fred Sanford with "I'm comin' Wheezy!" 
 
Everybody get down huh 
Everybody get down huh 
Everybody get down huh 
Huh huh huh huh, Shazam! 

On the court I go by the name Praying Mantis 
Got the edge and I've got the advantage 
If you could see things from my vantage 
Point then you could better understand this 
I'm in the lab all day I scrabble all night 
I got a bedazzler so my outfit's tight 
When it comes to panache I can't be beat 
I got the most style from below 14th street 
Internationally known as the Keebler Elf 
Can't keep a catalog up on the shelf 
I splash on beats like sauce on spaghetti 
Putting MC's out of business like they're Crazy Eddie 

Everybody get down huh 
Everybody get down huh 
Everybody get down huh 
Huh huh huh huh, Shazam! 

I know you're sitting pretty in the Hampty Hamps 
Posing like you're rolling with that camp 
In layman's terms let me break it down 
You're flipping and flopping just like a flounder 
I'm a hip hop scholar while you're left back 
So Jeckle and Rush go back to Lefrak 
I'm a simple man like Chance Gardner 
Working 9 to 5 Dolly Parton 
Got rhymes for jerks that's bringing on drama 
Which rhyme you want first? The one about your mama? 
Goodness gracious golly gee 
Shazam! Freeeeeeak out with the genie! 

Everybody get down huh 
Everybody get down huh 
Everybody get down huh 
Huh huh huh huh, Shazam! 

Freak out with the genie...</pre>
