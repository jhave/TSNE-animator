[Kool G. Rap]
No doubt
The real drama shit

All ya rap niggas pay homage
When he raps, spit atomics
When verse crash the Earth like a comet
Raise a prophet, make hot lava spit out like vomit
We Vietnam it, scramble ya brain like an omelette
Spling baby link the bomb it, keep you reek niggas in bondage
A convicts we Allah, then we bomb it
We trom it, it take a Terror Squad to dis arm it
We layin with grenades in our palms, two hours longer

[Big Punisher]
Ah shit nigga, you got me started momma one of the good boys
Said she got a 400 pound retarted Bronx nigga from the Projects
What nigga you don't want it, cock figga figga got it
You make me sick, fuckin wit Pun, youse a crazy bitch
Hold him for ransom, or cut off his tongue in cause he itchin
80 stitches across cheak, 70 more for talkin cheap
A buck 50 even nigga, that's regulation on the street

{yo and come on scratched}

"No man can go against me!"

{more scratchin}

"You don't stop me"

[Kool G. Rap]
Probaly socks soes inside the trenches
Closin in for miles to inches, killin the distance, enemy flinches
Death finces left for kid limus
Made mine behind the barb wire fences
Crossfire tent winters
Saw my man blow, bandana tied tight like Rambo
Burn a slug make the land glow
Niggas screamin for medics and ammo
Every soldier in your camp go

[Big Punisher]
Me and my man Joe got ya back
AKA Joey Crack, AK with the mack, makin my to the pack
Everyday I gotta be strapped, cuz niggas don't know how to act
You don't wanna go the gap, cuz T-Squad gonna react
Whatta we go? thugs and ammo, by a hundred tons of guns and rambos
Just in case you comin Commando
I'm a Sopranos and Corleones wit they own armies
And a couple of morrenos that'll die for me

[Kool G. Rap]
Hammers a law under the camouflage here to take jars
Put a cap inside ya cap and leave a four in your sarge
Killas are large, my two trade pound gauge will sound hard
For every round sabotage, bodies hit the ground hard

[Big Punisher]
That's a pound dog bout to get down and put the work
Try the jury but it wouldn't work, skit but it wouldn't merk
He glass, no glass, think fast yo ass too late, muthafucka
Put a d-rap too fast

{scratches}
