Verse 1: Treach

I got more damn time than I got money, honey
So if you're a gold digger, nigga please, that joke was funny
And for that diss comin from you in particular, shoot
You better kill it, for a scab that isn't no way's nears cute
You say I diss you hard after I did you fine
It ain't my fault, it's just your face that's mighty different in the daytime
See I'm the type to meet a girl and call her bluff
Then say, "I'll keep you if you're sweeter than my other stuff"
Not like a pimp or like a pope, cuz I know hoes too well
They watch the clock, then rock and do your crew while you're in jail
Well I'm a little bit of, or should I say a lot past that
So take your sad Kibbles 'n Bits rap to some other cat
Gimme this and gimme that, I give that ass a smack
You wanna get a richer life, you better get a mack
So he can work ya like the trick you really are, ya stunt
I'm hittin the backdoor when I come cos you're a fuckin front
You disappointed me, I had many plans in store
I didn't know that I was in for, a project whore or
a money-grabbin dragon wit no future plans
Pickin a newer coat or car, you need a newer man
Cos I ain't livin to be givin out what I done save
You wanna live in a condo, better find a cave
If we went half on the rent or if ya had a job
then I could think about it before I say "Oh naw"
Hell no is all I think about when I see you
Damn real is how I feel when I be comin thru
"Wit what?" is what you ask, I come thru in the end
"How's that?", cos when I drop one, I call her friends
Bravo, damn real, oh yes is what comes next
You gotta get up mighty early to twirl the Treach
I diss you, you'll be strugglin, and you say "I want you, sir"
If ya front, if ya stunt, huh, I might want her

[Word em up] (Damn, he just rip that shit)

Verse 2: Treach

(Oooooh, can I get?) Hold your breath
(Will you buy?) Not the Treach!
(I want those!) Never that!
(Gimme this!) Put it back!
(But you smooth) Very nice
(Ain't it dap?) Not the price
(Check these shoes) So, there's two
(They're on sale!) So are you!
Yes indeedy, I get greedy when it comes to dough
Cos then I'm eedy with the heebie-jeebies when I'm broke
And I don't so don't wanna roll a brother any long'
so I just try a nine-to-nine over time alone
Yeah, I spend in two's infuse, baby, you won't last
You'll be runnin so fast, your feet'll be kickin your own ass
Your every ride is somethin makes you just say "Hmmmm"
Cos she drivin his car more than he does any room
Ya call me "Jew" like it is true, I say "Now hey hey there"
Call us some black shit, pop a click, I say you're halfway there
If ya wanna movie or dinner, I say "Oh, here"
You wanna trip or a cruise, ya bitch, I mean, no dear
You'll be alright though, you'll find the right bro
He'll have the right ho, then y'all a go broke
But anyway, for any day, I'm dissin any trick
that's tryin to flick my Bic, cause I ain't havin it!
