Song:   Necrophilia
Typed by: www.suddendeath.org

Living in the dead zone, my foreplay
Takes place in the land where cadavers decay
Every Friday night I go out to the necropolis
And take my situation to the max and get on top of it
People think I'm sick and I never deny it
I just tell the people not to knock it till they try it
But nobody understands, they think I'm sick in the head
Just because I am obsessed with making love to the dead
I'm a necrophiliac
I'm in love with the dead, no I'm not smokin' crack
My wife dropped dead just a couple years back
"'Til death do us part" is a load of horse crap
Take it from me 'cause we're still in love
Got an everlasting blessing from the Man up above
My wife is the best, she makes me feel dizzy
Me and the corpse are gonna get busy

[Chorus]
Wham! Bam! Thank you ma'am
Those underground are the best in the land
Wham! Bam! Thank you ma'am
If the dead can't do it, no one can

Dead things rule, I mean nothing goes wrong
Man I never hear complaints about how big or how long
Many people think it's sick just because the body's cold
But I love bein' the one in total control
She never talks back, she doesn't even say no
She doesn't care if I'm diggin' her up fast or slow
And girls if you're looking for the man of your dreams
You can dig him up anywhere and I guarantee
That he'll be hard, but now back to me
The thing I like about it is so easy to see
I can go anywhere and I'll always have a date
She's all I ever wanted and she never comes late
Birth control, don't need none of those things
Dead things can't reproduce more dead things
Bones and rotting skin are nice to the touch
And the worms and the maggots don't mind too much
Cadavers look cool when they're dressed up in charms
Just as long as she doesn't fall apart in my arms
If you can't see it my way, don't give me flack
Carcasses are sexy when they're flat on their back

[Chorus]</pre>
