[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Hands high, everybody move
Yes muthafucka that means you
Ya'll want some, I want some too
The difference is, I want mines more than you
So make way when my truck roll through
Or get rolled over like you was new road
Mos Def with the Jack Jones super shooter tap long
Act wrong and get bbbb packed on
Then get thrashed on in all forms of fashions 
Black, Latino, Asian, and Anglo-Saxon
You rhyming like you got the next nigga pants on
I'm in the street getting my grown man's trance on
You want the ice cream then fill' em with they hands tore
Dude I ain't shit that they need to put they hands on
Party people let me see where your hands are
Brooklyn in the building got'em scared ya'll 

[Chorus]
Rock wilding wilding out in the beat another freak
Daddy got'em hot in the street
And it's the rock
Wilding wilding out in the beat another freak
Daddy keep'em hot in the street
I need to hear it from you mami (freak daddy you nasty)
Then let me see you work your body (what daddy like this?)
Oh yeah hold your finger high in the air 
Yeah So I can roll 'bout to lock and load right there  

[Verse 2]
Jones Brooklyn New York
You see Mos Def, you see a black man a walk 
When I kill with the pussy boy dark
This full of big shot the world boom boom shot 
Boom the block when I response for that 
come ice on that to make the ghetto run hot
Non-stop for the night and the dark
One shot gon' make the ghetto bbbbbbb 
The Buck stops here and the club rocks here
To see the game change 'till ya must watch here
My flow automatic see my gun cock here
The rubber rock love make the dog shot here
I put it in your ears but I won't stop there
I put it in your body if you can not hear
You smell something nice dude it's not hot here
It's freak daddy blow it to ya hot must fear

[Chorus]
Rock wilding wilding out in the beat another freak
Daddy got'em hot in the street
And it's the rock
Wilding wilding out in the beat another freak
Daddy keep'em hot in the street
I need to hear it from you mami (freak daddy you nasty)
Then let me see you work your body (what daddy like this?)
Oh yeah hold your finger high in the air 
Yeah So I can roll 'bout to lock and load right there
