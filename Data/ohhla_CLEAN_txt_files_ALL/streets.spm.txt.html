[Low G]
Yeppa, yeppa, homeboy
It's your nigga Low G
Putting it down for the nina nueve
We're givin' props
But we did this quick
So don't trip
If we forgot ya clique... (Clique...)

[South Park Mexican]
(Verse 1)
I move a hundred
Pounds in my hustle town
Come around
Fuck 'em down with my underground
Puffin' pow wow
Clouds in my teepee
But my heina
Hollerin', "Release me"
Prime time
Like shines on the high mines
Hellafied rhymes
Huh
You rewind twenty-five times
Another fool puttin' down the truth
You can't fuck with the Riddla
On Tha Roof
Mister
Go-Getter
Kick the more better
If she wanna go, fuck the hoe, let her
The wanderer
Hillwood hustler
Turn your back on your gal, and I'll, uh, straight
Clown in my H-town
Is you hoes really
Ready for the take down
Break down
Stay brown

Play 'round
POP POP
Make your whole clique catch the Greyhound

(Verse 2)
Stickin' move, hittin' licks, sweep 'em left to right
Act a fool when I one-two, check the mic
Come trip with the pimp in the smoke grey 'Llac
I jump in the shit, and there's no way back
Creep the seven
Seven
Seville
Convertible
My Cadillac got a three-foot verticle
Jump in the front
Bump in the trunk
Weed turn to smoke
Skunk in my blunt
I'm the cool homeboy, I'm a fool with no patience
Got a Dope House in seven locations
Professional
But don't test my testicles
On the pedestal, I'm colder than an eskimo
Gotta have it
Causin' panic with an automatic
Believed in myself, when no one else saw my magic
Gifted child
Raised in the wicked wild
Put the street on beats
Who trippin' now

(Verse 3)
I be the actual, factual rap supernatural
Blowin' up national
It's understandable
Not to mention, what I'm stressin'll leave you second guessin'
Dope sell itself, saw my CD steady pressin'
You can't see me
I flow so freely
You motherfuckers more slimier than seaweed
Just a pee-wee
Son, you watchin' too much T.V.
I'm on CD
See more pussycat than Tweety
On the underground nation
Layin' foundation
The biggest problem that H-Town's facin'
Did a lot of wrong, but mom, stay calm
Cause now I drop bombs on CD-ROMs
Your raps get pimp-slapped
You kickin' bubblegum
Only real niggas know where I'm comin' from
Under confusion, run up on Houston
And bow down to the styles I am usin'
