Oahahohhhhhhhh
Happy birthday baby
Baby, baby, baby

Girl when you're with me, you know we ball
For sure
And baby every time I have a ball
With you
So I made reservations for, this special day
Baby
Baby bring your baby oil, and your lingerie
C'mon

We got a five star room, the luxury suite
With marble floors, and don't thank me
Cause I did -- I did this for your birthday
All for you, all for you
With a king size bed, the Cognac bar
The sweet TV with the VCR
And I did it -- I did this for your birthday

Yeahahahah, yeah yeah yeah
Whoahowhoa, ahh yeah

I felt like I could break a couple of rooms, for you
That's how I brought myself to buy this expensive room
Let's do it in the jacuzzi
On the balcony, baby, whoahhahhh
Girl let's enjoy this special night
Cause the bill's on me

We got a five star room, the luxury suite
With marble floors, and don't thank me
Cause I did -- I did this for your birthday
Whoo!  Do not, do not, do not.. did not do it baby!
With a king size bed, the Cognac bar
The sweet TV with the VCR
And I did it -- I did this for your birthday
I'm what you want, I'm what you need

Let's get on the floor - let's get on the floor
Let's get in the chair - in the chair
On the sink - on the sink
In the bed - in the bed
Back on the rug - back on the rug
In the tub - in the tub
I perform - I perform
Anywhere - anywhere
Let's get on the floor - let's get on the floor
Let's get in the chair - in the chair
On the sink - on the sink
In the bed - in the bed
Back on the rug - back on the rug
Or in the tub - or in the tub
I'll perform - I'll perform
Anywhere - anywhere

You have a five star room, the luxury suite
With marble floors, and don't thank me
Cause I did -- I did this for your birthday
	You seem like you've been workin so hard
With a king size bed, the Cognac bar
	And you need just a special day
The sweet TV with the VCR
