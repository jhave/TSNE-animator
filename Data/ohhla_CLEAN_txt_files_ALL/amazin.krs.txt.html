[Intro: KRS-One]
Ay, ay Buckshot, look at them run
Ha, look at them run up the bloodclaat block

[KRS-One]
Class in session, y'all late an' shit
Buckshot, KRS is some amazin shit
We spit amazin shit, you'll be amazed and shit
Like you in a maze and shit
Standin there like this some amazin shit
I'm old school, I'm not amazed by SHIT!
I smash rappers crazy quick, with crazy hits
Then head to the clinic cause they make me SICK!
This some amazin shit
Just the grit and the grime of the streets we was raised in it
And it gave us an amazin gift, an amazin lift
Like when you blaze an amazin spliff
Huh, or drink a fifth with me
On some amazin shit like an epiphany
I spit amazin shit, get hip to me
Then hop to me, learn my philosophy
Ha! Yeah! Light up!

[Loudmouf Choir]
Amazin... la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah
Amazin... la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah
Amazin

[Buckshot]
It's amazin, Buck's the dot-com don
When other niggaz was like, fuck the dot-com
Shit amazin, how soon we just came up
Like an elevator, and he hella greater, and what?
Stand up, and I don't mean the comic relief
Cause shots'll hit your funny bone every time it released
My mind is a beast, amazin what you find in them streets
Let's see - Buckshot, my peeps, my grind and my heat
B.C., amazin, like Luthor Vandross, I amaze the purse
You should see what the man costs a verse
You don't amaze me, I'm the boss
You ignorant niggaz is caught up in the maze of course
Nigga get lost

[Loudmouf Choir]
Amazin shit, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah
Amazin shit, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah

[KRS-One]
Amazin shit, Kris still blazin shit
Yo these rappers ain't sayin SHIT
They say, say, but I'm Beyoncé
Man, I'm +Upgradin+ shit
Y'all needle rappers, barely makin it
You better change your ways before it's too late an' shit
You see how I spit that amazin shit?
It's my God that gets appraised for it
RUCK!

[Sean Price]
It's amazin, so amazin
Keep talkin that shit I'll push your face in
It's amazin, so amazin
How I handle all that shit I been facin
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh (yo, yo)
Amazin shit, Ruck's an amazin ape
I eat your food but, first say amazin grace
Pray, I don't come through and blaze the place
But the terrible tec-9'll do your amazin eight
Amazin, the way the god spit these bodies
Y'all niggaz screamin like you hit somebody
Amazin, nigga, listen
I crack your face with the fifth now
Grab him the eyepatch like you related to Rick
Amazin, the way the god rap to the beat
Beat earth, wind and fire when I'm packin the heat
Amazin, how I went from nothin to somethin
Took somethin, make somethin and threw it all away on nothin
Amazin, the way the god was rapin the ville
A couple of years ago from sellin pagers and pills
Amazin, how the god once slung crack
And survived more shootouts than Chow Yun Fat
Amazin, motherfucker

[Outro: Loudmouf Choir]
Amazin... la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah
Wa-da-da-day, wa-da-da-da-day-ay
Listen to my 9-millimeter go, BANG!</pre>
