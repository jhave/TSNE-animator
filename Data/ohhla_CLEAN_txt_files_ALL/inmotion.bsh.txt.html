[Baby Bash (Chiko Dateh)]
I'm in motion (Sideways)
I'm in motion (Sideways)
I'm in motion (Sideways)
I'm in motion (Sideways)

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
I chop it up like Paul Bunyan
Grippin' and runnin'
Always into somethin', hustlin'
Cause my stomach keeps grumblin'
I'm hungry, I'm starvin'
Slangin' in apartments
The game so's dranky, though, it's Messy like Marv
But I got the bloodline of an indian chief-ah
Slang everythang, but I only smoke reifer
Off top, I ain't 'bout no trouble
I'm just a young chico, tryin' to get his bubble on
I keep it trill, from set to set
Cause them real cats know it's all about respect
Drop the top in ya candy and keep ya paint wet
It's out to them hustlers and O.G. vets

Chorus:
[Baby Bash]   I'm in motion
[Chiko Dateh] Sideways
              Til the next block, cut a stoplight
[Baby Bash]   I'm in motion
[Chiko Dateh] Sideways
              And I gotta make it happen tonight
[Baby Bash]   I'm in motion
[Chiko Dateh] Sideways
              Til the next block, cut a stoplight
[Baby Bash]   I'm in motion
[Chiko Dateh] Sideways (Sideways...)
              And I gotta make it happen tonight

(Verse 2)
I'm in motion
Sippin' love potion
Smokin' on that
Fluffy, duffy tree, mayne, I'm cruisin', I'm coastin'
Turn up the radio, but they playin' bullshit
The same old thang, I want some cool new shit
So I keep twelve CDs in my trunk changer
Cool with everybody cause I ain't a gang banger
I got so much love for hustlers
And hustlers got love for me
And we don't get down with suckers
We keep it P-I-M-P
I got a super fly chica and I'm off to the land
To way high, Baby Beesh and the bed
Ma

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Mr. Shadow]
I'm in motion, coastin', floatin' in the sky
From the 713 to the 619
Mr. Shadow and Baby Beesh
All you haters
Hide your hoes and put they ass on the leash
Ha ha
Yeah
We do the most out the least in the streets
With no limits, we creep, puff in Vegas and suites
We stay grindin'
Never waste time
I got it make it happen tonight
Night
Night
Come and slide
Dip and swerve
Right through the night with plenty trees to burn
Hah
We flip birds, to make ends meet
Why don't you come and spend a weekend with me
Come on

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Baby Bash
So many places
So many faces
One love to them homies, catchin' cases

Repeat Hook
