[Intro: Eamon (Ghostface Killah)]
Yo, Ghost (What up E?) It's Staten Island

[Hook: Ghostface Killah, Eamon]
We love those hoes, in they white t's and their Nikes, never wifey
Love those hoes, at the Showtime, mic'll co-sign, dealt with those, mine
Love those hoes with the big butts, Betty Boop cuts, shake it like what
Love those hoes nigga please we, love those hoes

[Eamon]
God I thank you for this wonderful night
Wishin' I can see you one more time
But I don't think it will happen, so I thank you
If you want to still fool around
You can come to the next town far
Until then, I gotta go, so I thank you

[Chorus 4X: Eamon]
I love them hoes, love them hoes
Love them hoes

[Ghostface Killah]
From 718's, 310's, Pretty Tone' yo, I love them hoes
All in they pantyhose, down to they pinky toes
Cinnamon hips, strawberry lips, skin tone like a Hershey Kiss
Me slow, eskimo chilly bitch, thick like a healthy bone
Strip really quick, out of those clothes
Slip into a fancy robe
Tanqueray, lemon twin, lingerie
Know how to romance these hoes
Pretty Tone, take 'em on
Bake a bone and make her moan
Gimme dome, gimme loans, and they miss me when I'm gone

[Eamon]
Look, as there even though we just met
No need to get upset
But I got a show, gotta go, so, I thank you
And if you wanna still get sexed down
You can catch the next Greyhound
But, until then, I gotta go, so I thank you

[Chorus 4X w/ Ghostface Killah ad-libs]

[Eamon]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Damn, I ain't lyin, these hoes are providin'
When my dick hits your pussy, there's no denyin'
Kissing my body, make me cum like shotties
Love them trees, but I got a new favorite hobby
There ain't no stopping, from hoes gon' Hoe Woppin'
When I come to town, you know what the fuck's poppin'

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro: sample (Ghostface Killah) {Eamon}]
I can't seek anyone but you (To the ones that be in the mall
In them ill strip joints, to them, bow legged ones
Them pigeon choke ones, the ones that suck they thumb all day and
The ones that ain't afraid to pop off, you know how we do
Them big country ones, those really bout it vibe son)
{Damn, you know that I love them hoes} - to end </pre>
