(Black I'm proud)

(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Black I'm proud)
(I'm black)
(Can't stop the bumrush)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Blessed with the talented format
I'm kickin the earth like a doormat
The more I grow the more I understand
And I don't really care about a grafted man
Cause he wants to mold me, shape and carve me
But I use my mind like Marcus Garvey
Dr. King was a man with the new faith
They got rid of him, that was the last day
Clueless clucks, the men of a Klan
Cult to crucify the intelligent blackman
Honoured as African and die as a dweller
Reach out to teach like Nelson Mandela
Power for all my people
The Rebel's back and the brothers are equal
So let's unite so we can all resist him
Black, the shade of the solar system
Freedom of speech, I scream it loud
Proud to be black cause black I'm proud

(I'm)
(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Black I'm proud)
(I'm black)
(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Can't stop the bumrush)
(I'm black)
(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Black I'm proud)
(I'm black)
(Can't stop the bumrush)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I'm livin this race like a marathon
And I'm goin out like Farrakhan
But he's not out cause the brother is all in
The blackman was here since the day it began
Beware, the cursed seed is out there
Tragedy will live for a light year
As long as we fight and go all out for each other
Black'll be the color of my brothers
Find your ancestors and what they did
Cause intelligent blacks built pyramids
Seek and obtain, you'll find descriptions
Pyramids were built by Egyptians
Who put up plantations to work the fastest
Mothers and sisters raped by slavemasters
Gamed by the devil and swift talkers
And till this day my brothers are sleepwalkers
Tricked by the devil to feel inferior
In all reality my people are superior
Freedom of speech, I scream it loud
Proud to be black cause black I'm proud

(I'm)
(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Black I'm proud)
(I'm black)
(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Can't stop the bumrush)
(I'm black)
(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Black I'm proud)
(I'm black)
(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Can't stop the bumrush) (bumrush) (bumrush)

(I'm)
(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Black I'm proud)
(I'm black)
(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Can't stop the bumrush)
(I'm black)
(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Black I'm proud)
(I'm black)
(Can't stop the bumrush)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Born a freedom fighter, here to keep fightin
Illustratin the issue on a government item
Africa is in need but the government's steppin
Collectin taxes for testin weapons
You can stand by the Rebel cause I know it's gonna be
A better day, another way, I'm proud to say
Black is dominant and here to stay
Before this day I cannot wait
To see who will win over love and hate
Use your brain, don't kill it with base
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
Hannibal conquered Europe on elephants
Another blackman of intelligence
We grow with the black complex
But we should be encouraged by Malcolm X
With freedom of speech he spoke it loud
(No sellout, no sellout)
Proud to be black cause black he was proud

(I'm)
(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Black I'm proud)
(I'm black)
(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Can't stop the bumrush)
(I'm black)
(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Black I'm proud)
(I'm black)
(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Can't stop the bumrush) (bumrush) (bumrush)
(Can't stop the bumrush)
(Black I'm proud)
(Can't stop the bumrush)</pre>
