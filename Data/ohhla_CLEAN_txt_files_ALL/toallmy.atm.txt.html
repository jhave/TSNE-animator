Yeah, I saw the sign in the window, for the job
Yeah I got a high school education, but that's all
Skills? You wanna know if I got some skills?
Yeah I got some skills
This goes out to all my friends

What you gonna be when you grown up?
I'm all grown up and still don't know what
I mop throw up, I rock a tow-truck
Long as it means that I can get old and post up
I used to be a typical winner
Living off the gratuity from delivering your dinner
Cause as a kid, I didn't consider
that I would get the opportunity to be a full-time spitter
I love this occupation
I got bosses across the nation
Validation is an understatement
and I don't really know how to take a vacation
My kind don't have any free time
I'm so distracted, but everything's fine
I speak shine and I read signs
Appreciate your opinion but this dream's mine
It's all love, we're cool
But you don't tell a cowboy what to do
I was the ugly kid that didn't listen
Little big man full of ambition
Based on imagination, just like you
Daydreaming, thinking bout the things I might do
I used to paint, draw and illustrate
Mom would facilitate and it would feel okay
Seems like yesterday still plays a part
When I grow up, I wanted a job making art
Picture that, how many years old?
Young enough to mix up love with career goals
But I was just this tall when they told me
that the world was mine, but the papers weren't signed
There's no deed, so proceed to go seed
up the whole piece like it owes me groceries
Don't breathe until you formally know me
Won't leave? Better call authorities
It's all love, we're cool
But you don't tell an astronaut what to do
The turntables stole my heart
Burnt the paintbrush, broke it apart
I miss it, I might revisit
But I wasn't that good, I admit it, maybe you can't tell
But as a kid, I wanted to be Melle Mel
And later as a teenager I wanted to be LL
Then I discovered weed and I wanted to be Del
But thank God eventually I found myself
It's funny when I bump into fools
I used to go to school with, and they ask what I'm doing
Half of the time I want to crack a lie
But fuck it, I'm still a wannabe rapper guy
Hahaha, yeah I guess that it seems that way
I get to see the world, and it's decent pay
As long as somebody want to see us play
I wake up every morning and I seize the day
It's all love, we're cool
But you don't tell the president what to do

It's like that y'all, it's like this y'all
I don't get to call in sick y'all</pre>
