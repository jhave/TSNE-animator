	Yo papi, why you always seem like you got somethin on your mind?
	You be stressin yourself out yo
	Come here baby, let me relax you

[Guru]
But listen yo.. I'm thinkin, I'm thinkin
I'll be right there.. I'm thinkin..

It's time, for a revelation

Out here there's many things to see associated with pain
It's time for a change, a revelation
Out here there's many things to see associated with pain
It's time for a change, a revelation

[Bu]
Ghetto life strikes, hold on tight
Ain't no lettin go, AIKKA, AIKKA AIKKA
is the beat in the street, crooked cops cock shots
wreakin havoc, it's tragic, heated, yung'uns
run around gunnin for fun, burners blaze
til beef is well done, chest get infested
with lead more than less took to the head made it dead
Rest in peace, no grievin, no remorse it's

[Guru]
costin, all of our lives and all our dreams
It seems we can never accomplish thing
But we oughta do somethin, for all our strugglin
I ain't talkin bout the loot they get from cocaine smugglin
or jugglin, two or three jobs, or maybe more
Co-workers all a bore, what am I doin this for?
I can score if I stay pure at heart
but I guess we had it rough from the start

Out here there's many things to see associated with pain
It's time for a change, a revelation
Out here there's many things to see associated with pain
It's time for a change, a revelation

..

[Bu]
I deal with what I got to get what I need
Speed and greed, only ends up as body bags
I'm just glad, I got rep to breed
Too many droppin, like leaves off trees, fall it's like
all for none, none for all
In this land of the damned, everybody down to be the man
Nuff scams are ran, not only fiends scheme it seems
Dreams unruly obstructed
Innocent minds corrupted
Brothers and sisters scufflin for dimes and nickels

[Guru]
And fickle minds can't find what lurks behind
the propoganda, and the subliminal seduction
So wake up and renew
Even if you only do this for you
True, I'd do a killing in self-defense
But then I'd end up in the state pen

Out here there's many things to see associated with pain
It's time for a change, a revelation
Out here there's many things to see associated with pain
It's time for a change, a revelation

..

[Bu]
It's a danger zone, your own's prone to stick you
Victimize will make your blood trickle, this is critical
condition for livin, life and death decisions
makin moves with precision, raisin ranks and bank
Mixin with some click tank thick on the grassroots level
I connect the spots from the lots of production
Buildin on the function of the unit
Hit ya in tunes switched before you freak MC's scatter

[Guru]
It matters not, if the weather's hot, or cold
Circumstances, make a sucker act bold
I don't fear the threat of violence
I'm just examinin the reason behind it
I find it's like a paradox, sorrow or glory
but everybody's got a story
Like when you pulled out, because they made you mad
You weren't quick on the draw, so too bad

Out here there's many things to see associated with pain
It's time for a change, a revelation
Out here there's many things to see associated with pain
It's time for a change, a revelation

It's time for a change, a revelation
Revelation
Revelation
Revelation
It's time for a change, a revelation
Time for a change.. revelation..</pre>
