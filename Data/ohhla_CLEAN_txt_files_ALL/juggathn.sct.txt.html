Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I get 'em everyone, spring, summer, fall
I can make them bail, do a summer soul
Throw 'em in the air, watch the money fall
I can make the bricks to a summer sun
I'm on a juggathon, I'm on a juggathon
I'm balling with the bricks, I'm on a juggathon
I'm on a juggathon, I'm on a juggathon
Two hundred bails on my wrist, I'm on a juggathon

[Verse 1]
In pressure making jewels, shooting basketball
Throw them bails in the air, free bails fall
I'm standing in the booth, just like Lapron Jane
I got 45 thousand in my gym shorts
I got flying past my houses like an airport
Every other bad freak won't you shout with me?
That's how I like the streets, I got the recipe
My partner Big J on the juggathon
Just made it to me, go money marathon
Juicy say he got a jugg, he gotta take 'em all
You know I'm rapping pretty, then I'm dicing more
The messing on the city, everybody goes

[Chorus]
I get 'em everyone, spring, summer, fall
I can make them bail, do a summer soul
Throw 'em in the air, watch the money fall
I can make the bricks to a summer sun
I'm on a juggathon, I'm on a juggathon
I'm balling with the bricks, I'm on a juggathon
I'm on a juggathon, I'm on a juggathon
Two hundred bails on my wrist, I'm on a juggathon

[Verse 2]
Jugg, jugg, jugg, I'm on a juggathon
Count, count, count, I'm a money counter
Welcome my jewel, house brick is in the corner
I get money large amounts in bags, I don't need to count them
I indicate I'm on a jugg, I'm a stone mountain
Young Scooter, diamonds clear and a water fountain
I get price of the year, nigga, on the street
Anything I do I'm a jugg the streets
My daughter gotta eat, I gotta feed her
Jugg, jugg, jugg, money all I see
Everyday present for the jugg play
Every day for me is jugg day</pre>
