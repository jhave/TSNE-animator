1 -    Wanna go to war wit me baby? 
       This gangsta bitch can get crazy 
       Don't you decieve this lady 
       Don't fuckin' play wit me baby 

Repeat 1 (3x)

I'm kickin' it, I be doin' that playa shit 
You be doin' that hoe shit, hatin' up on me bitch 
I cannot help I'm a Prophet queen, ridin' until I die bitch 
Do you wanna get fucked up? 
Do you wanna see me tear da club up? 
Do you wanna get bum rushed? 
By niggas wit triggas that's ready for come-up 
I bet you be wonderin'
how do a lady be flowin' just like them niggas do 
I be spyin' on your crew 
That's how I know exactly what to do 
Don't be playin' wit me 
It hurts me deeply to see that you decievin' me 
I'll get you, I'll study up on the novel known as Misery 
I'm comin' wit shit to _Make 'Em Say Ugh!_ like that Master P shit 
I'll be hangin' wit niggas that's _Ready To Die_ like Notorious BIG shit 
Don't be fuckin' wit me 
When you see I'm on some other type of mix 
Don't try to be 'bout it in front of your friends 
Put that red dot on your chest 
Them mafia niggas taught me well, nigga can't you tell 
I sport the mean designers bail, nigga doin' swell 
To end this verse off, I be known to have you niggas pissed off 
But keep on pissin' 'cause I ain't gon' stop until yo' ass drop 

Repeat 1 (4x)

I be the one you love to hate 'cause I'm so so slick 
You look into my eyes, but never knowin' what I'm gon' do next
I'm like outlaws, we warrior thugs 
Showin' 'em our blood 
It don't mean 'cause I'm a lady that I can't have the blood 
I keep my mean mug wit me for you hoes &amp; that shit
I get my smoke on daily, 'cause I got to have it 
To all you lovely ballin' niggas lookin' for a sidekick
Put yo' money by yo' dick &amp; we can do some business 
I'm not tryin' to be rude 
That's just how it's gon' be 
I'm rollin' wit The Prophet Posse and we 'bout our money 
Many people say I'm crazed 
Damn, is it a lie? 
I guess I'm crazed now-a-days, baby it's do or die 
I'm bein' real, you bein' fake 
Like some counterfeit cheese 
While yo' bitch ass on yo' knees doin' just as I please 
Enquiring minds wanted to know what's gon' be my next move 
In Monopoly, you's a fool, 'cause this game you gon' lose
