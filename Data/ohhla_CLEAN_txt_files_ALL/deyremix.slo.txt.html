[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
Yeeeaaaahhh
Shawty Lo and the Big Cats
Yeaaaahhhh
It's the remix so bring ya top hat(eh)
What ya talkin bout
It's L-O
I rap now it's rap skizzo
Thirty bands... fo shizzo
Eight balls same price as the kilo
I'm a boss
Handle My B-I
And I got them same kinda guns like T.I.
See I been that way since knee high
Real dope boyz so you know I trap or Dizzi
No lizzi
I'm hizzi
Like kells I believe I can flizzi
And yeaaaahhhh I'll see you later
BIG UPS... TO ALL MY HATERS!

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Guard your woman dawg or I'll take her
You'll hear her scream from College Park to Decatur
I was a snotty nose with no paper
Now my crib sittin on 22 acres(woooo)
Get it right fool I gets money(yep)
If you think Ludas not filthy you's a dummy(yep)
I was allergic to the roof on tha cutty
So I took the top off like a playboy bunny(whatup pops)
Catch me pimpin in a robe and some slippers(oo)
Ridin down 85 while I'm stuttin on my Gixer
Mouth full of swishers or ridin with ya sister(wooo)
and Six david beckhams or a trunk full of kickers(hahaha)
Take a picture of the mister it'll last long
And these haters get stretched out like a bad thong
So partner mash on or get mashed up
Think you can fuck with Luda then put a million of your cash up(hi)

[Chorus: x4]
L O L O Dey Know Dey Know

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I'm in my cool whip insides jello
Hop up out that pretty muthafucka like hello(hello)hello
Ladies how you doin
Dat nigga crazy girl don't say nothin 2 em(haha)
Dey know dey know got white low low
Rob who? Take What? (gun cocks) hello
They know I give a fuck about them haterz(nope)
Young jizzle been gettin paper(yeeeaaaahhh)
Granite? wheels on da coup like savors
Hit da club with 20 brawdz like flavor
I'm on da top floor(floor) no neighbors
Who u kiddin I get my 87's tailored

[Verse 4: Plies]
Went from two ounces to a mazarrati
First rap check bought choppers for everybody
Before they know what's under my shirt the glock 40
Get 25 a show next month I want 40
Born a real nigga but I die a goon
Just bought a new choppa gon use it real soon
Got the streets on lock homie I can't lose
Put me anywhere I'm the realest nigga in the room(believe me)
Take a look at me I'm what you call street approved
Got a lot haters but even more tools
I play dumb homie but neva been a fool
Cut my dog off I heard he snitchin too(ha)

[Chorus: x4]
L O L O Dey Know Dey Know

[Verse 5: Lil' Wayne]
(HA)
Now what I look like
And if it ain't money then I don't look right
And that don't sound right
I swear you can get a full clip not a sound bit
SU-WU gang and if you ain't with it then you in the food chain
I'm in that wide body I'm a need two lanes
Blue Seats white paint wetter than new rain
Like a white person with blue bangs
I keep a black glock red dot blue flame
Feet hanging out the window jock my shoe game
Cause all my kicks fly like lu kang
Old player new game
I'm focused I'm thinking like I got two brains
I'm in my prime I feel like a new wayne
How come there is two women but ain't no two waynes
I don't know what you do but I do thangs
It's Mr. every time you see me got a new chain
My flow crazy I ain't too sane
But I am thee shit &amp; they just poop stain

[Chorus: x4]
L O L O Dey Know Dey Know

Shawty LO Man...</pre>
