[Intro]
I got you bro, here we go!

[Childish Gambino]
My flow like Hawk Jones, the little bitty one
Hit me on my iPhone, you can text me when I'm done
I'm sicker than your grandparents honey
I'm sicker than that bitch at the end of Ben Button
Your mixtapes mean nuttin; I put out albums in a week
Eat these other rappers rhymes that is why my breath stink
You get fucked like nymphos
These clothes make niggaz roll up they windows
These Frito banditos, cause they're like chips
Cause they talk shit, see me bend it
These niggaz 'round here they don't let your tongue slip
Send you black and blue like you an African crip
My green like a weird watermelon, no seeds
And my green like a weird watermelon, all leaves
My green don't fit in my white skinny jeans
Cause I move anywhere - so I guess I'm the queen~!
Yes, yes yes, I'm so Hawk Jones {*3X*}
Yes yes, Andre, show 'em how it's done

[Dree Dei]
Whoever wanna climb this beanstalk is gonna find me
No I'm not a giant but my name is An-dree
Oops I meant Andre', add an extra "E"
and the accent mark, yes it's Dre, not Dreeeeee
He's so confused cause he thought I was a boy
Well I got two +Mounds+ but no +Almond Joy+
And all these fools wanna taste my cream
Infatuation thick like a slab of good brie
Infatuation real, all they think of is me
Yes all these fuckin charlies got a lactose disease
But they not intolerant, they daydream more than moderate
It's, just not a meal until you sprinkle parmesean on it
It's, just not a get until you givin all you got on it
It's, just not a cock until you put all of your heart in it
Look at him starin at my lips
Ain't they thicker than a pair of African hips?
I thought we was friends but he think we gon' kiss
Here he comes leaning in, he swing he MISS!!
How's it feel to taste a mouthful of air yes
How's it feel to kiss me knowin I am not there

[Childish Gambino]
Boy I need a censor, boy you need a mentor
These boys need to be lead like they two pencils
Yes I'm a black nerd, it's that simply
Call me Poindexter or the black Ed Grimly
Girl attitude stay stank like kim chi
But she ain't Korean and her boy ain't friendly, uhh
Turn your girls that are friends to fuck buddies
Keep em on the wire, that's why I cuddy
And every girl that I'm friends with wants to fuck
That's why she waits 'til I'm drunk then she runs amuck
Guess boy my name's an aphrodisiac
Yes boy at the hotel's where I leave 'em at
I am +Animaniac+, cause I'm so +Wakko+
Better +Warner Bros.+ when you see a chick act hoe
And even if she's so +Angel+ that she's on +Bones+
No girl is so fly to fuck with Hawk Jones

Yes, yes yes, I'm so Hawk Jones {*3X*}
So why don't these motherfuckers just leave me a-lone</pre>
