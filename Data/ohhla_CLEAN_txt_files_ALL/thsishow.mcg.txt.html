[McGruff]
Yesh, yesh, y'all, Gruff stay fresh y'all
Puffin bless y'all, in the Lex' to the mall
So called bad chick, sexin you all
Give Gruff a call, let me flex in them walls
Twirl ya backbone, get my mack on
Get your Reebok money, send ya ass home
Is Gruff a playa? Nigga ask Pretty Tone
Flooded rolly lit, smooth goldy shit
If I ever die, your Joe's gon have a fit
Herb be phat, linen down derby hat
Gators bitin, minks and fur on me back
Live talk shows, pop corks offa Mo's
My money grows, while fiends snort up they nose
Private jet, nigga, whole life is set
Life like begets, mega ice on the neck

[Chorus: McGruff]
Yeah, this is how we do, just make ya bu-ga-lu
Harlem World baby and the LB crew
Now we do, party to the sky turn blue
Pollyin, yeah, that's what we gon' do

[Mr. Cheeks]
I'm creepin uptown, and my mans ride wit em
He got three Dutches in the ash tray and Sal wit 'em
He gettin blunted, so he wanted me to slide me
Give me two tic, so we can get wild wit him
We on FDR Drive, doing 95
Smokin trees, on the ways, Saturday Night Live
Word is butters, plus they muthafuckin pad is hot
Smoke the weed, drink the liquor, so I said why not
Peepin, ring the bell, as soon as we hit the spot
Shorty open the door wit the short and the knot
Wit the belly button showin, the L that slip
Yo I smell that shit, yo I can tell that shit
Soon as my man creep wit shorty inside the room
I con', I continue to spark up my moon, cuz

[Chorus]

[McGruff]
Aiyo, Gruff holdin, keep the bar rollin
Check me in VIP, gettin love open
The fellow wit cream, gon sell her a dream
Gas luck, needs to get the hell in between
Knowhatimean? Kick game, puff la green
Everywhere Gruff go, shine like high beam
Word up, ya know the ice burnt up
Give me one minute have your wife skirt up
And all playa haters get they life hold up
Undertaker might have to dig some dirt up
Chocolate mack nigga, push an ack vigga
Call it Don P., then go relax wit her

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
