Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Told my city I got this, just give me a minute
I don't just want the world, I want everything in it
Just as fast as I make it I'm a spend it
Wake back up in the morning and go get it
Just as fast as I make it I'm a spend it
Wake back up in the morning and go get it
Said just as fast as I make it I'm a spend it
Then wake back up in the morning and go get it, motherfucker

[Verse 1]
I get up in the M, bright and early with it
Chef me up some breakfast and have your girlie with it
Had er roll me 2 blunts while I was in the shower
Jumped in my Benz and started blasting, I got the power
My homies still pump that bass, yea they got that powder
And all my weed medicated so now my loud is louder
Oh you smoke that ratchet, you's a favorite fowler
Fuck your dollar and yo dream, I'm dreamin the dollars
I'm on that, yea I'm on that other shit
I'm rackin up and I' stackin up, a nigga actin up and now I back him up
I said he actin up and now I back him up
Yea nigga, millimeter
Extended clip, hanging out
And bitch I ain't talkin bout chillin neither
I'm paper chasin, I'm paper makin
You mad I'm cakin, that's paper hatin
Gang of Haitians and a few Jamaicans
Find out where you stay and by the datin
Outside yo house, KKK'in
Ready to kill a nigga
Then bring his head to me, like it's distant nigga
Vigilante mode, for that move your family dough
And I never said my pug name in a rap, I understand the code
Uptown, go-getter
No affiliation with them ho niggaz
And I go hard for my daughter so God forbid if I die she'll need no nigga

[Chorus]
Told my city I got this, just give me a minute
I don't just want the world, I want everything in it
Just as fast as I make it I'm a spend it
Wake back up in the morning and go get it
Just as fast as I make it I'm a spend it
Wake back up in the morning and go get it
Said just as fast as I make it I'm a spend it
Then wake back up in the morning and go get it, motherfucker

[Verse 2]
Woke up with the money on my mind
Scarface, yea bitch, the world mine
If you talkin bout this paper then I'm with it
Wake up in the morning and go get it
Dollar signs, I chase mine
2 tuck by the waist line
Time waste for no man
And this man don't waste time
6 figures or better, money on my mental
My chick get on the highway
Chickens in the rental
This is simple, yea it's simple math
30 in the rental stash
When she touch down we break it down and we split this cash
Purple got me livin slow
But we make a living fast
Kama after kama after kama, digits come in bags
I don't chase women, I just chase the paper
Middle the one time, the same one to the haters
That 40 got a laser, I ain't missin shit
Milkbox a nigga, now he missin, family sick
Yea I'm cut from a different cloth, different rules, different law
If you want no problems then it's best you do not get involved
Boss hard, outlaw like slim thug a nig
Hustling is in my veins, the chickens I be pluckin em

[Chorus]
Told my city I got this, just give me a minute
I don't just want the world, I want everything in it
Just as fast as I make it I'm a spend it
Wake back up in the morning and go get it
Just as fast as I make it I'm a spend it
Wake back up in the morning and go get it
Said just as fast as I make it I'm a spend it
Then wake back up in the morning and go get it, motherfucker</pre>
