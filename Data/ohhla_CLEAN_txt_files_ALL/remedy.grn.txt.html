[Ruth Anne]
I sell it by the bottle
Oh I'll make it last all night
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
I got the remedy
Oh, we let it go
So won't you come sit next to me I got the remedy oh, you never know
oh I could give you what you need
I got the remedy

[Verse 1]
My life's enough for anyone to get gassed
I could hit a bungalow
8 in a bin bag and still get a quick lash table looking like November the 5th
I won't remember anything memories are myths I'm a piss artist
It's an art to me last seen partying with Charlie Sheen true its half ten
And I'm looking in the mirror at me so how come I can see two and a half men?

[Ruth Anne]
I sell it by the bottle
Oh I'll make it last all night
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
I got the remedy
Oh, we let it go
So won't you come sit next to me I got the remedy oh, you never know
oh i could give you what you need
I got the remedy

[Verse 2]
She got me in her eyes no c.s. I'm in a vibe on a hype I could go all night no re-est flow b-est no t-est
got chicks brain training no d.s. Jolly cause I bring my buds between my thigh and my ball's a bag a my monk man am I drunk?
and high won't somebody body send Kate Nash my love? In a state of confusion soberness is a problem I solve by way of solution
I'm gonna start a revolution with my recipe put it in a bottle
call it the remedy anybody every say they'll better me in rap?
You know I got the remedy for that are you mad?
You need medicine, therapy in fact and you know I got the remedy for that are you mad blood?

[Ruth Anne]
I sell it by the bottle
Oh I'll make it last all night
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
I got the remedy
Oh, we let it go
So won't you come sit next to me I got the remedy oh, you never know
oh I could give you what you need
I got the remedy

Oh we let it go
so won't you come sit next to me I got the remedy oh. you never know oh I could give you what you need I got the remedy</pre>
