[Intro: Juganot]
Gotta gets the cash, I gotta gets the dough (Remix!)) 
I gotta gets the cash, I gotta gets the dough (Uh Huh!)
I gotta gets the cash, I gotta gets the dough UH!  (Juganot baby!)
I gotta get it, got, gots to get it come on!!! (Joell hit 'em!!!)

[Verse One: Joell Ortiz] (Juganot)
Pennies, nickels and dimes and quarters, dollars and fives
And, tens, twenties, fifties and hundreds gotta be mine
I'm a product of poverty I would like to be fine
One day no Honda, Maserati reclined
No mice in the trap no roaches in the kitchen
People the size of me on their latest televiison (UH!)
Lounge downstairs full bar nice women (Uh Huh!)
And somethin out back in case shorty like swimmin
YEAH!!!

[Verse Two: Juganot]
Gimme a dollar for all the women that hollered
After hearin me on radio spittin that yada yada (Yeah)
Uh! I have alot enough to buy myself a yacht and sail
Away to somewhere hot about a hundred knots an hour (HA!)
Sippin on Coladas how you doin pretty mama? (HEY!)
If this is all a dream you can leave me in the coma (UH HUH)
'Cause I don't wanna 'wake and have to deal with all the drama
Tryin to make it in America, etcetera, etcetera
Gotta get the cheddar up!

[Chorus: Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc]
I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!) 
Well I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!)
Said I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need 
And If I share with you my story, would you share yo' dollar with me?!

[Verse Three: Cassidy]
The more money I make the more money I need
'Cause I still got bills still got tummies to fee
And a bunch of these responsibilities is killin me
To pay bills I'll move at Hillary is you feelin me?
I got the Bentley I got the Benz I got the Beamer
And I got the watch full of frozen Aquafina's
I hug the block 'cause I love the gwop
I need a dollar like Juganot, cuz you a thug or not?

[Verse Four: Red Cafe]
Yeah! Bring Havoc when a team move Mobb Deep
Alot of niggas claim King I'm the marquee
Big bankroll life in the fast lane
Benjamins behind me like Andre's last name (WHAT ELSE!!!)
Remix that a bang for the whole winter 
I'm a gold member, you a goal tender
Ciroc boy, never sober
Y'all takin orders, we takin over

[Bridge: Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc] (Papoose) 
Well I don't know If I'm walkin on solid ground 
'Cause everything around me is, crumblin down 
And all I want is, someone, to help meeeeeeee!!!!! (Papoose! Pa-poose!!!)

[Verse Five: Papoose]
I'll take a cow from a farmer feed it to all you cowards
Y'all can have the beef, all I want is the dollars
He workin out, he think he diesel like the sour
He can have the steroids all I want is the dollars
They knocked down the towers, build a mosque tomorrow
They dirty, give 'em blood bath and led showers
How can we have a tornado in Brooklyn?
It came from Hell's kitchen what is the devil cookin?!

[Verse Six: Maino]
Man you don't even know what I'll do for a dollar
Push a nigga mama off the roof for a dollar
Hop out the bushes with the tek for a dollar (DAMN)
Wouldn't wanna see me stress for a dollar
"Cause I get it poppin, just for a Porche
And my chick want a bag and my boy need Jordan's
Big body Benz no tints I'm bossin
The thought of bein broke just makes me nauseous

[Chorus: Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc]
I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!) 
Well I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!)
Said I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need 
And If I share with you my story, would you share yo' dollar with me?!
