	Too much on my mind, just too much on my mind (Repeat 4x)

[Charlie Brown]
My mind, ready to go, it's time
I gotta gotta know, where I'm going in L-I-F-E
A constant headache for Charlie B
But I take an asprin and sleep
For a bit, then I dream about making more hits
Wake up, it's not funny
The rent is due and I don't got the money
The landlord says "Get out"
Sorry to hear that, no doubt
I WORK for a jerk that can't understand
Pride and soul cause I'm a man
Minimum wage in the age of the future
Move too slow, damn, it might shoot ya
Make fools out of me and you
I sit relax and just continue
To (to) think (think) that there is
Just too much on my mind

	Too much on my mind, just too much on my mind (Repeat 2x)

[Dinco D]
Got up this morning (Too much)
Still sleepy and yawning (Too much)
My stomach is growling (Too much)
The bus is crowding (Too much)
I told my boss I'm getting paid (Too less)
So I quit, and sit with my last check
I go to the mall and can't get fresh
For 99 dollars and 95 cents
Plus, I don't want to hear it
There's too much on my mind and I can hear it
Calling for the D-I-N-C-O
Here comes my girl, wait, I gotta go
Nah, I'm not running, I'll just say no
And go and tell my homeboy Jerell
He can't spell but he knows, relief
(He can't spell but he knows relief)

	Too much on my mind, just too much on my mind (Repeat 4x)

	The mind is more delicate, more action than a predicate
	You think of things that are never thought of and then settle it

Do this (Do that) Go here (Go there)
It's too much on my mind

	The mind is more delicate, more action than a predicate
	You think of things that are never thought of and then settle it

No money (No job) No home (No life)
It's too much on my mind

	Too much on my mind, just too much on my mind (Repeat 4x)

[Busta Rhymes]
Aw baby, what a feeling, what a way to feel when you're down and beat
You're all by yourself in a little corner, no one to help you
Yo, it's like this, you know sometimes you gotta stand up strong for self
Do the little things on your own
Strive hard, strive for perfection
And I'm a tell you one thing
Leaders of the New School, definitely gonna rule things
&gt;From our beginning time, till forever, peace</pre>
