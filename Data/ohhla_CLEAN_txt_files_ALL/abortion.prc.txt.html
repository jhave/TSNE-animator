[Sean Price]
P! Stop, hatin on the God
Lyin like your pants on fire, perpetratin a fraud
The shit you pop doesn't reverberate with the God
The eight shaped and raised the murder rate, oh my God
Oh my God.. I am the best to do it
Repeat I am the best to do it
Defeat all the rest who knew it, sneak attack
He who eat ya back, you blew it, stupid, truth is
P~! I am smarter than your average
Joe Bear or Jesus of Nazareth, battle shit
Battleship, battleship, I ain't playin games bitch
That'll click, gravel pit, that'll be your grave bitch
Uhh, my shit is off the meter
Off the reefer, awkward, I talk with heaters
I walk with, orthopedic features, coughin
Why? Cause I, eat the creatures often, abortion

Muh'fucker! P...

[Flood Diesel]
Uhh, stop, analyze and realizin that
We them guys y'all niggaz really idolizin
Great advertisin for a day sodomizin
Wild nigga in school, quick to Columbine 'em
Police lookin for me, couldn't fuckin find him
Then I got consignment, then I copped some diamonds
Did my time, then came home, now it's fuckin poppin
He don't know me when I robbed him son I rocked a stocking
Even sold him chocolate, 'fore I dug his pockets
Girls said I need to stop it yeah I know I need the profit
You ain't with my mans? You the fuckin target
Flood and Sean P again cop the shit at Target
They said, I tried to open up the market
I said I O.J. and opened up the carcass
Even taste the blood, that's a starving artist
A.C.G.'s in your face like sorry Charlie
