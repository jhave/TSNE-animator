[Verse One]
On behalf of the better half
That ain't been better havin' 
I'm feelin' like I better have an answer
Or explain why I'm nothin' but a cancer to us
When really I'm a Virgo and the truest
Form to be true is all you ask but I'm foolish
So your girlfriend is provokin' you to do it, so you doin' it
Say you through will all my foul ways
But you never come when you period is five days
I gotta be high to be around ya
You make me beat around the bush just to beat around your bush
Shit, see that thing there was mine
You home, you never minded me so I stepped out
But that was only one time
You knew I'd come back like Motown 25
I'll moon walk it if I'm truly in your heart
And I'll meet you anywhere so baby tell me where you walkin'

[Chorus] [Duffy]
When I get to Warwick Avenue
Meet me by the entrance of the tube
We can talk things over a little a while
Promise me you won't step out of line

[Verse Two]
You stood me up and I understand
But on the other hand I don't understand why you got other plans
Is it another man? Just let me know now
Scorin' gets your rings, why you tryin' to rebound?
Nah
You just tryin' to run game
Havin' my brain in a maze like I ain't that amazin'
Or you can do better on some hate shit
Spiteful
But if you like them then you like this
I mean they're like me
And more than likely
If we don't fix this then you'll see the same things
So if you done with these Beijing games
We can meet up at the same ole' place we was supposed to
And I'ma post two hours, what you gon' do?
If there's another place, let me know before I move
And if I do go you better come through 
'Fore I make another 'How Can You Slap' youtube clip

[Chorus] [Duffy]
When I get to Warwick Avenue
Meet me by the entrance of the tube
We can talk things over a little a while
Promise me you won't step out of line

[Verse Three]
So you finally got the nerve
To feel me
Prolly cause them niggas wasn't near me, clearly
See, they ain't even like me tho'
Those dude reachable, I'm like Captain E.O.
But this about you and me tho'
Let's get off the phone and we can speak when I see you
I put on my knickers
My blue and white Pippens
And headed to the station for some praisin' and kissin'
And "sorry Wale"s "I was wrong, I was trippin'.
Would you please be a saint and have the patience to forgive me?"
I told myself that I would play it cool
She better shed a couple tears when she come through
But I was wrong, baby girl sung another tune
And there was rage in her eyes I wasn't really used to
She said, "I love ya. That's why I do this eye to eye."
Kiss me on the cheek as she whispered, "This the last time.
Goodbye."

[Chorus] [Duffy]
When I get to Warwick Avenue
I'll tell you baby that we're through
I'm leaving you for the last time, baby
You think you're loving but you don't love me
I've been confused, out of my mind lately
You think you're loving but you don't love me
I want to be free, baby, you've hurt me</pre>
