You know you fucked up right?
Bye bye, wish you luck with life
But I'd be damned if, I let you manage
to bless that blade and keep taking advantage
Look man, yeah you shook my hand
But that was back then, we're not good fam
I'm the fool cause I started to be cool with him
But I got schooled in the art of opportunism
I ain't the only one that walked away
Look around, everybody gone today
You all alone with your empty chest
So bury the bones with any regrets
and keep those skeletons piled in stacks
Just drink your medicine, don't bite your glass
I tried to make a difference
But the only thing that changed was I gave you distance

[Chorus: 2X]
I won't trust you again
Getting better at choosing friends
This time the loser wins
Cause I learned how to cut off the looser ends

[Slug]
I'm not tripping, this just an excuse
for me to dick down a little bit of the truth
We killing time and time's killing us
So I won't waste mine tryna grip a grudge
But don't twist it into what it isn't
Don't call, don't write, don't visit
I put you on ignore, you're not the homie anymore
The only thing that you could show me is the door
Game over, yeah who's winning?
Save your gas, I refuse to listen
If you doing math, we doing division
Don't even ask how I've been, there's no you in existence
Go your way, I'll go my way
And you keep going until there's no one to violate
And I'ma remember your last impression
Thanks for that lesson

[Chorus: 2X]

[Slug]
Now I lay you down to sleep
I swear to God you're dead to me
If I should give you any thought
It's just to teach self how to not</pre>
