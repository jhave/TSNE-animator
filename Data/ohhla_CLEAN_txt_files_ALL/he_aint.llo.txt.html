(*talking*)
Dedicated to all the playas, all over the world man
Everybody that knows, how to keep things
On the down low, you feel me

[Hook: Big T]
He ain't gotta know, about the freaky things we do
Cause ahh, that's between me and you
He ain't gotta know, if you won't tell then I won't tell
Cause baby girl, you know you fine as hell
He ain't gotta know

[Lil' O]
If you won't tell then I won't tell, girl you know you fine as hell
Quit acting like an angel, cause you know that you be lying well
Say you at the beauty shop, say you with your homegirls
Having drinks, doing all the things that girls do a lot
Like gossip and, say you went shopping
Girl you know your man would never think, you out here bopping
Young playas like me, who ain't want for nothing
Cause I'm a young balla stunning, and I'm riding on buttons
So you ain't gotta front with O, girl I know that you choosing
And if I say let's leave right now, girl I know that you cruising 
But that's our bidness, ain't nobody gotta know what we doing
So let's keep this on the low, so no one knows that we screwing

[Hook: Big T]
He ain't gotta know, about the freaky things we do
Cause ahh, that's between me and you
He ain't gotta know, if you won't tell then I won't tell
Cause baby girl, you know you fine as hell
He ain't gotta know, if you ain't tripping I ain't tripping
So let's do this baby, part of my pimping
He ain't gotta know, if you won't tell then I won't tell
Cause baby girl, you know you fine as hell
He ain't gotta know

[Lil' O]
Now all that pay your bills, I ain't got the patience man
Girl your dude at home, you know I'm just the maintenance man
I'm the one you call, when you wanna ball
What he done pissed you off, you wanna forget it all
We can get some codes, smoke some marijuana
Sip on a little Hypno', sit up in my sauna
And when we done, best believe I'ma put it on you
Cause they gon hear the backdoor, way in California
You glad you did it don't you, you feel better huh
You probably tried to give him something, he wasn't with it huh
But that's iight, he gon look all wild
When you walk up in the house, with that big old smile

[Hook: Big T]

[Big T]
About a damn thang, about us
So keep this lil thing, on the cool

[Lil' O]
Say boo, just chill don't tell just hush
I know you love, my feel my touch
It's real I'm trill, you trill let's crush
No rims, it's just a little freaky thing for us
But that's nobody's business (baby)
I ain't your man, and you aint my (lady)
Plus I won't tell nobody, that you really (shady)
Plus I know my loving, got you going (crazy)
