[Intro: Rick Ross]
They told me it's never too late for PRAYER~! {M-M-Maybach Music}
WELL LOOORD! Pray for us niggas
Cause we ready to die for this shit

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
If I die tonight I pray I get buried in clean drawers
Line us all up, just bury me with my dawgs
If I die tonight I pray I get buried in clean drawers
Line us all up, just bury me with my dawgs
Bury me with my dawgs, bury me with my dawgs
Line us all up, bury me with my dawgs
Bury me with my dawgs, bury me with my dawgs
Line us all up, bury me with my dawgs

[Rick Ross]
I look to my left, I look to my right
All I see is my blood, all I see is my life
If it go down tonight, my nigga look out for momma
Been robbing my whole life, I gotta look out for karma
Selling them white squares I swear I'm well prepared
Fifty in my chopper whoever could go to hell
Chopper still heat seeking, block getting hotter
When them niggas go to beefing, slide me til we got 'em {*dog sounds*}

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Aight partna... ay
Machine gun man, seen him on the news (who me?)
Every gun I had was one the home invaders couldn't use (hah, hah, hah)
Had a nigga catch me slipping, I refuse, not a chance (nah, nah)
Listen dude, Tip can use any tool known to man (ay, ay, ay)
And don't think that I can't hit you just cause it ain't in my hand (say what?)
Got a sniper, drop your ass where you stand, understand? (Bow)
Fifty cal with a scope and a chopper (hey), boy you got to 
Plan a way straight to the undertaker, know me for the doctor (AY)
Should I die, lay me next to my daughter Lelah and my partner (what it is)
Rap your ass off somethin' proper with that BLOCKA, BLOCKA, BLOCKA!
Did just what I gotta do, it's me or you and boy I'm saying (HAH)
Know that ATF listening, I'm just playing, I'm just playing

[Chorus]
