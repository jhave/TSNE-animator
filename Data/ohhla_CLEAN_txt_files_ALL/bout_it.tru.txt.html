Master P (talking) 
Yeah ha, I could never turn my back nigga. (Never.) 
I could never forget where I came from. 
This for all my muthafuckin' soldiers. (Master P.) 
Native of New Orleans. (Louisiana)
All you TRU Soldiers.
Give it up for Richmond, California. (Puttin 'em on the map.)
Put em up, represent, where you from? (Westside, southside.)
Check out some of this down south shit though nigga.

You bout it, I'm bout it bout it
If you bout it bout it, well say you bout it bout it
I represent where them killers hang
Third Ward, Calliope Projects, we got are own name
It's a small hood, but it's all good
And Mr. Rogers aint got shit up on my neighborhood
I represent nothin' but G's (G's)
&gt;From Richmond, California all the way back to New Orleans
That murder capitol of the world so fool watch your back
The mighty rise and clip but some tourist don't make it back
And niggas aint trippin' on yo life G (Life G)
They ready to take your ass out before the count of 1, 2, 3 
So give me your gold chain, what bout your gold ring
Niggas down south quick to put you in that body slang
I mean that body cast (ha ha), what bout that body bag
You aint thank quick, that's why you on your ass
And niggas stuntin', perpetratin, talkin shit
You roll through the projects you might get your wig split
Mr. crazy wanna borrow a quarter quarter
You best not fuck with them fools that gone on that water water
I mean that clicker juice (Dang), fermaldahide (like dat)
Whatever you want, the more they dip in cigarettes to get high
Like some alcohol, niggas don't even give a fuck
They leave you stuck in that muthafuckin' black truck
Break you off like some muthafuckin' Japanese (damn)
Aint no love in this hood, aint no love for G's
And these niggas killin' bitches too
And these bitches settin up niggas cause don't give a fuck about you
You gotta be bout it, bout it, cause I'm bout it bout it
Third Ward, Calliope Projects, you know they bout it bout it
And that Fourth Ward is bout it bout it
I mean that Fifth Ward, and Tenth Ward, you know they bout it bout it
Twelfth ward, bout it bout it
And that Thirteenth, Seventeenth uptown, downtown, across the sea
Bout it bout it, cause we bout it bout it
My little homie Hot Minus Sign, they bout it bout it
Bout it bout it, I mean we bout it bout it

And eady to bust some of those who doubt it
I'm rowdy as the fuck, hoes you best be backin' up
&gt;From this below sea level hoe comin' like a tornado 
Brings drama, either way I have to do this
So break your selves, niggas here comes a woman to this TRU click
The bitch you love to hate but yet ain't bold enough to face
Cause Mia X will finish first in this grand diva race
I kick your earholes laced with my pimpstress funk
Punks playa hate beacuse they shit be bump
But I dunk a niggas head into a toilet full of piss
Cause in this drama field, fool we aint takin' no shit
Downtown Sixth Ward left feet on guard
Seven Ward hard heads, niggas out that Saint Bernard
Ninth Ward pressed for desire and Florida, New Orleans 
So bout it every day we comin harder firewater 
Got them niggas gettin' high off my floss, gumbo
Regreet em plus my ate two fate got em payin twenty bones
So bring it on cause I gotta recognize
