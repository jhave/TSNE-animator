[Fantasia]
Like your name is MISSY ELLIOTT, my name is Fantasia Barrino
And what I can GIVE YOU, is Fantasia Barrino
Holla at your girl

[Missy]
Two thousand five!!  WOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Wake up in the mornin with my man next to me
Up all night like we've been on that ecstasy (YES!)
Mixed with Hennessy, he got the remedy
Yeah my nigga into me, I can't say it simply
We, take a quick shower for the hour conversation
Time to have relation, love makin in the basement
Smack it up, flip it up, crush it
One minute, two minute, I was no question (AHH!)
Who would ever think that I'd be givin up the goodies
Walkin 'round naked in a pair of pink footies (HA!)
Just like them hoes at the shows
Half-dressed clothes doin whatever, who knows (OH-KAY!)
Nah I only get freaky with him
No menage-a-trois, not freaky with them (WOO!)
It's just me and my man
Yes, said me and my man

[Chorus: Fantasia]
For my man, I'll do whatever
Cause what I feel, this love, it make me do thangs
For my man, I'll last forever
Cause what I feel, this love, it won't never change

[Missy]
I'm never insecure when we not together
Even though he tell me he in love with Ciara
I'm from a new era and I bring terror
to any chick who check my fella when we together, so
He treat me like a Cinderella, yup
Protect me from the storm like he my umbrella (okay)
This fella deserve primo stellar, he be a Roc-A-Fella
Not to Jay-Z and Dame but the charm on the chain be platinum
Jacob Roley lookin sporty, {?}
Money stackin keep track and I fax him
If I can't find his ass then his ass out of gas
He only gettin one pass (OH-KAY!)
My man, is my man and nobody else's
Damn right, I hope y'all felt this
Old ladies 'round the coast-es
You better get focuses 'fore you ever try to approacheth

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Missy]
See when you in love you might have to say it
Don't say you won't, never say you won't
You might get real mad, wan' act all bad
Act up in the street, a few chicks you gotta beat
Cause they disrespect (disrespect)
Clockin your man from his feets to his neck, UHH
You gotta let her know that's a no-no, slap her real slow
With a right blow whichever way it go
And keep it gangster
Show these bitches that you can't come
Yank 'em, point blank 'em, top rank 'em
I ride for my nigga and I'm happy with the trigger (YES!)
Scared how you figure?
My man (OH-KAY!) Say it time again
Say my man (my man) my man again
I say my man, it's just me and my man
Said for me and my man

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[scratched] That's my man.. yes it is.. this love..</pre>
