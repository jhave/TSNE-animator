Would you come and swoop me 
I'm in your city 
Would you come and swoop me 
I'm in your city 

B-Legit: 
Get's my freak on... 

I get my sneak on 
Hop in the Brome 
Call baby on the cellular 
Wassup I'm in your area 
And is it cool tonight for you to like get away 
Meet me down at the parking lot at Safeway 
But not alone 
You might want to bring your friends 
But make sho' you and her don't forget your ends 
I can't wait to see the tatoo of your kitten 
It's me and 'Vitti in the night we City 2 City 

Levitti: 
I'm in your city 
Would you come and swoop me 

B-Legit: 
We checked in in the suite up in Hollywood 
And the bubble bath did your playa patna good 
She brought lingerie, pumps, and body oil 
Scented candles and rubbed on my love handles 
I'm only in for one night 
My flight'll be out in the morning 
I better get it before I start snoring 
She was already up on top 
Goin' buck for the whip cream, cherries and nuts 

Levitti: 
That's why little sister loved to give it up 
Two in the morning I was all in her 
You know I had to be the creeper 
She kept jockin I have the fever 

I'm in your city 
Would you come and swoop me 

B-Legit: 
Five in the mornin' hit me with the wakeup call 
Whole room smellin' just like alcohol 
I had a ball 
But now I gotta giddi y'all 
I gotta a show in Pine Bluff Arkansas 
And I must say the stay was all gravy 
And keep it like that 'till I get back baby 
And maybe next time we can take it to the 'nitti 
It's me and 'Vitti in the night we City 2 City 

Levitti: 
I'm in your city 
Would you come and swoop me 

B-Legit: 
Yeah its like uh...Me and my cousins hit the airport you know. Just 
touched down tryin to get something 
crackin' you know. Check into this motel doin' what we do </pre>
