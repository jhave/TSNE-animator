Heyyyy (8X)

Heyyyy "She's rockin big booty" (8X)

[Ced Gee]
I get naked and wicked, when I stroke it and stick it
Then I go for a ride, that you can't comprehend
Ladies screamin and creamin, cause I'm comin with Adam
Hi-tech apex, orgasm they have em
Most times multiple, in different dimensions
Activate rides, now I'm ready to enter
I see big proton, gaze through your galaxy
It's gaining momentum, you're having a fit
*dee-dee-dee-dee* Lubricated you are, so I can rip rip rip
The walls of the spaceship, transport to recepticles
Like Nat King Cole said, you're Un..forget..table

Heyyyy "She's rockin big booty" (8X)
Heyyyy "She's rockin big booty" (8X)

[Kool Keith]
Lieutenant Uhuru.. Captain Kirk, has nothing, to do with you
Neither Dr. McCoy
You ain't had it fair since..

Supersonic, primitive, riding on the BOOTY
Take em on down to level four, sequence
Cowboys check the funk measurement, station
Floating with time, verdict one, affirmative
Insert eight into a cervix, incredible
Over combined between sheets, a nucleus
Get in a square, open uterus, BLOSSOM
Hidden away, see a side effect's intercourse
Floating in space with Captain Kirk
Lieutenant and Scotty can beam us in

Heyyyy "She's rockin big booty" (10X)

Heyyyy (8X)
