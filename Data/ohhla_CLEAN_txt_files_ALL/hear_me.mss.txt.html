[Intro: Ms. Haugton phone call]
I been checkin' on your moms and dad (uh)
And your brother since the day you left (left)
Passed on and went away with God (uh)
But for your momma its been so damn hard 
I hate to even hear her cry (cry)
Aaliyah she asked me why (why)
Would her baby girl go this way (oh)
Can you give me better words to say 

[Chorus]
Come one day she'll see you again 
With the same ol' beatiful smile 
Long hair and the voice of a hummin' bird
You'll be singing them same ol' songs 
Aaliyah can you hear me 
I hope that you're proud of me 
Me and Tim we been doin' our thing
But its never been the same since you had to go
I ain't never met a friend more incredible 

Ohhh... 

[TLC]
I know you're in real good hands 
With God but damn I miss you 
Aaliyah if you see Left Eye
Will you tell her 
Me and 'Boz miss her too 
Cuz no one's gonna fill her space (uh uh)
T-C L not replaced 
Y'all the reasons we learned to love (love)
Fly high wit' your 22 doves 

[Chorus 2]
One day we'll see her again 
With the same ol' beautiful smile 
Crazy but sexy cool 
And she'll be rappin' them same ol' songs 
Lisa can you hear me 
We hope that you're proud of us 
TLC has come a long way 
But its never been the same since you had to go 
Cuz the healin' process will be long and slow 

Yeah 

Aaliyah I know you're in a safer place 
You're face to face with the creator and our maker 
And if you and Left Eye happen to chat 
Tell her me and Tionne we know she's much safer 
If you see Biggie smalls up in the clouds
Tell him he's still the illest emcee we had around
2Pac there is only one, Big Pun RIP
We say one (one yeah yeah) 

[Chorus 3]
One day we'll see y'all again
With the same ol' beautiful smiles
All styles so many styles
And y'all be doin' the same old things
The last time we seen ya
We hope y'all can change the world
Let 'em see how short life be
It will never be the same since ya had to go
To the music world y'all are incredible 

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah</pre>
