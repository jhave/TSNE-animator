[Intro: Sway]
DJ Wonder
We gon rock at least 5 beats, to show your versatility
What you're made of
You gotta rock 5 back, aiight?

[Childish Gambino]
As the world's turnin, I feel like I'm a worse person
My tongue's hurtin, from all of it's work cursin
And I'm not certain I think my father's LeVar Burton
'til I'm walkin in circles and I'm talkin in third person
In the eigth grade I got high off paper mache
I put it in my desk and I let it ferment a day
Cause shit, ain't nothin changed
I'm still known as a rude student
That'll walk inside your class and make fun of your school shootin
I could prove it; I'm too cool as a matter of fact
I've been writin these verses while I'm havin a heart attack
I'm in your bedroom crankin No Doubt and Staring Back
Stereo blaring, Gwen Stefani can holla black
I'm not black, I'm a white boy with dark skin
At a Klan rally wondering why they won't let me in
I'm drunk off this gin and I'm high off Ritalin
Fuck it, let me get to the next beat

[Sway]
Okay let's go, Donald Glover, Childish Gambino
Showin and provin, Sway in the Mornin, DJ Wonder!

[Childish Gambino]
Oooh, wow, yeah
I'm the nerdiest rapper ever, I'm wearin a Cosby sweater
and I'm reading Oscar Wilde rippin my foreskin to make a washable condom
A bunch of assassins tried to jump me, they couldn't touch me
I rolled off in a yellow Humvee, with a bunch of monkeys
My taste buds hate fudge, man, plus I'm allergic
I'ma dress up like a surgeon so I could hurt Curtis, on purpose
And girls see my dick size and they realize, that they can't handle it
I get more sodomy than Tommy Lee and Pam - Anderson?
With my doo-rag in my left hand
And my iPod and my Discman
I get more kicks out of it than Jean Claude Van Damme
And I'm still spittin, still hittin
+Big Pimpin'+ like Hova, yo, let me be the rap, run over
Yea, lemme go, lemme go

[Sway]
Next beat NEXT BEAT, Childish Gambino, Childish Gambino
(That was the shit!) 5 Fingers of Death
Let's go, Sway in the Mornin, Shade 45

[Childish Gambino]
Let me feel this one for a minute
Oh my God like reggaetone, or somethin like that?
Oh wow, uhh, uhh, uhh
Childish Gambino, yo this off the dome
I gotta keep it goin cause I came from home
Come from Rome, Athens, or Atlanta, Georgia
Got somethin for ya
Yes I got some smores cause I bore ya
Like I got that Goya
You know how they play reggaeton in the beats when you in NYC
Meaning that me and I'm sickest
Yo, aaahh!!! Real Monsters like Ickis
Yo, this chick that I used to lick it
Now her name Aubrey Plaza
I didn't mean to kick it, while I'm gettin salsa
Like I'm eatin salsa, cause she Puerto Rican
Some people speakin ,like she ain't white
But you know that's alright cause I keep it tight

[Sway]
YES~! Number four, number four, number four
Stand up man, get loose!

[Childish Gambino]
I'm tryin to get loose, tryin to get loose
Man this early in the mornin, I ain't had any coffee or anything like that
Uhh, uhh, hahahahahaha~! (You go in or go out let's go)
Okay, here we go, yo
Nerdy word murderer in a purple convertible
Niggas ain't heard of him until his girlfriend converted him
Bitch niggaz is Ferguson, I guess I could explain it all
Like all these niggaz wanna bone cause you datin dogs
Or why the radio used to not play me
And why does every white girl love ukelele?
Where I'm from, that Jesus piece couldn't save me
and I'm still spittin shit cause I'm gettin like gravy
Eatin like mashed potatoes, I hate those
haters who say that I'm not black enough yo, you ain't wack
enough to fuckin touch my MC mic
You better keep it tight; eat a dick like you starvin homie

[Sway]
There you go~! Childish Gambino
And we gonna check him out we got one more beat man
(Oh one more beat?) Cause it's a workout
(It's a workout, it's a freestyle)
A emcee workout, after this you ain't gotta prove nothin to nobody
This is it right here baby let's go!

[Childish Gambino]
Uhhh
Yo, on this last beat I'ma goner
Gotta spit over somethin hard, like Nirvana; and I'm crazy
With the beat when it comes to this
Spittin it, shittin it, while I'm lickin it
I ain't even need to get it
Man these other un-C's, they need to get it
Why this LL Cool J shit, yo I got pesos and mesos
Meaning I can only hack with they ghost
When they go there, when I go back
And I'm still that, I ain't backpack
But you know, with the fuck the rest
Yo they say that is lame like Johnye West
or Kanye West, but I ain't Kanye West
I'm just tryin to stay the truth
And I ain't tryin to spit the truth
Yo, I do what I gotta do in a booth with Sway
Shay45 all day, y'all know what I'm sayin </pre>
