Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Aye I made an oath to my homies man
I told em they ain't gotta hurt no more
And I told em that's my word man
Rich homie baby, yeah!

[Verse 1]
They tell me make a wish
And I say whole thang
Give them folks my alias
And not my whole name
My cousin on my daddy side sell cocaine
Take off on that purple, call it soul plane
I get my blow from bone and ricky cause they dope the same
If you get locked up unpredicted then that hoe to blame
Should of never let that bitch knew you was on the way
You can blow from out that sack if you keep your pokerface
Fuck that, break your shoulder blades
Whole trumph don't throw ya spaides
Left my xbox in the water so I can soak the game
I heard yo lawyer blowed the case you need yo own help
Nigga you cant do shit for me
Bitch I pay my own self

[Chorus]
Home employed
My rich homies ain't gotta work no more
They saying
I cant put rich homies on my shirt no more
I got em paying fa my attention ain't gone hurt before
Every chance I'm with em I tell my niggas that
We ain't gone hurt no more yeah
I tell em we ain't gone hurt no more yeah
We ain't gone hurt no more
I tell em we ain't gone hurt no more yeah

[Verse 2]
If you was thinking I was gone, I'm back baby
Hate picking up the phone, send a fax baby
I'm riding in a ghost call it pat swazy
Yo mama did dope while she was pregnant nigga you's a crack baby
No keyboard but I'm backspacing
No precious I love fat faces
If it don't make money then it don't make sense
Rich homies they stank cause they on they shit
And ion get hit nigga I ain't vick nigga
See Imma rich nigga but I'll spray spray spray
I got me six figures
My clique bigger than the kkk its a whole lotta us
You ain't shit nigga we ain't with nigga
You say you killed nigga but you ain't killed niggas
I'm a real nigga
Lemme tell you how it is nigga
These niggas try to come in your face just to see whats going on
And it be the same ones that take off when everything start going wrong
They say that lame bitch straight and she ain't hurt fa nothing
That same nigga hating
Got em working fa me

[Chorus]
Home employed
My rich homies ain't gotta work no more
They saying
I cant put rich homies on my shirt no more
I got em paying fa my attention ain't gone hurt before
Every chance I'm with em I tell my niggas that
We ain't gone hurt no more yeah
I tell em we ain't gone hurt no more yeah
We ain't gone hurt no more
I tell em we ain't gone hurt no more yeah

[Outro]
