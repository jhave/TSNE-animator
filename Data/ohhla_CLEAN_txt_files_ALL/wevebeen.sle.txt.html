[Gipp]
Hey, look here
[Sole']
What's up?
[Gipp]
Shorty, I don't think this thing between us is gon' work no more
[Sole']
Oh, you don't think it's gon' work?
[Gipp]
Nah
[Sole']
You tryin' to say that's it?
[Gipp]
Man, it's over shorty
I gotta move on
Ya know, be gone, ya know
[Sole']
Ya know, I think I was feelin' the same way anyway
So it's over?
[Gipp]
I'm out
[Sole']
Cool

[Gipp]
We been down this street
Down this block before
Bout to let it all go and hit the front door
Down and up, up and down
Told you I was in it big
This the last time that me and you will have this conversation
In a situation goin back and forth
About, who right, who wrong
The same ol' song
See I'm a fresh hit
Anotha girl gon' get
Slow rides, through the park
Gettin hugs in the dark
I know you don't trust me
That's why you beeped my thirty times
But I wasn't doin nothin but in the street gettin mine
And everytime I tried to explain you wouldn't listen
So I left irratated, confused on what to do
You, used to bring light, now you bring pain
So I gotta let you go and let you do ya thang
You used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang

1 - [Dani] (Gipp &amp; Sole')
    We've been trying too long
    (Uh, yeah, to get it right but it just won't work)
    We've been trying too long
    (Yeah, uh, to get it right but it just won't work)

Repeat 1

[Sole']
Don't mean to press ya but I'm needin to know
If this the end
And if you leave, am I your friend or your foe?
Don't wanna go, you see me turn and look
I walk away slow
Motion be the way
Make sure you catch the kisses I blow
I see you lookin like you wanna take me back in yo' arms
Like when you used to hold me tight
And you protect me from harm
But now we can't resolve the problems that we share
It's a mess
I thought we'd work it out
But now it seems I have to confess
That this the end
But you still knowin that I wish it's the start
You slowly breakin my heart
I gave you everything, you tore it apart
Can't go in circles anymore 'cause we been trying too long
Sometimes you just can't work it out
That's why I'm crying this song
You, used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I'ma have to let ya go and let ya do ya thang
You used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So now I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Gipp]
Me and you, used to be cute
But now we paint a different picture
Love'll get 'cha, and leave ya deaf, dumb, and blind
Everytime, we had some good days, remember those
Momma told me that's the way love goes
So I'ma leave it at that, get my hat, get my strap, get my bags
Be gone in the wind, baby girl

[Sole']
But now I hear you so I guess it's nothin left to be said
It's time that I fled
It's feelin like a blow to the head
I thought that soon I'd see the day that you and I would be wed
But now the end has come, the love is gone, I'm cryin instead
And you, used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I'ma have to let ya go and let ya do ya thang

[Gipp]
Nah, you used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang
You used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang

Repeat 1 to fade</pre>
