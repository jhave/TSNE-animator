Typed by: AZ Lyrics

How long you gonna sleep
How long you gonna act like you gonna act
Be how you wanna be
So when you gonna see
You need to get the facts but you wanna laugh
At what I'm gonna speak
You steady sinking deep
Plus ya sinking fast why you running back
Man why you wanna leave
So whats it gonna be
You need to get with that but your missed the fact
That what I'm gonna speak
This aint all a dream
You can try to dash but you gonna have
To face your reality
So this is what I seen
One day it's gonna crash then you'll understand
Everything I'm gonna mean

Wake up wake up
Wake up wake why are you falling asleep

So what you wanna do
You turn off the lights then you run and hide
And act like you never knew
Man you aint gotta clue
But you think you're right every single time you
Do what you wanna do
So when you gonna choose
When you gonna try to find your peace of mind
It's right there in front of you
It's time to make a move
You can still deny but the time's running out
Very very soon
So what I gotta prove
Why you walking blind when the signs
Is so obviously coming thru
Man this is now for you
You can try to lie and just still deny
But can't change what is true</pre>
