[ VERSE 1: Too $hort ]
Whoever try to buy a new Benz, spend money on your friends
Order up some shit with a pocket full of ends
Ain't no sympathy for suckers, bitch, I'm a hustler
For the last 12 years I could never get enough of
That cash, I keep it in my jeans, bitch
Have you ever seen it? A big pile of green shit?
When I spend it, bitch, I'm the man
I do what I want, suckers do what they can
That's why I moved to the A, straight from the Bay
I'm still mackin bitches everyday, anyway
And if you don't like it, I don't give a fuck
I'ma still let my top down and turn this shit up
Nothin half on my business, keep gettin paid
If niggas stick together, maybe we'll live to see the day
When everybody keep ballin like me and my folks
Let these gold-diggin bitches count my spokes
Short Dog in the house

[ VERSE 2: Yukmouth ]
Hop in the Ranger Rover, mob, thrustin this out my car
Shit better be hard, ghetto celebrity star
Smoke 'dro out of jelly jars
Boss to be fraud, catch me at the telly with broads
Havin ménage-à-trois, x-ed out on the celly with Todd
"Short Dog, what's up?" He told me Roger Troutman passed
I hollered, my shit about to crash
Copped a block of hash, an ounce of grass
Damn! Poppin Crystal, poured me a glass
Then poured the whole rest of the bottle out on the flo' for yo' ass
This's for my nigga Roger, the godfather of futuristic funk
Here's the ganja, get it crunk
Twist the skunk, hit it once
And keep that shit movin and
Thug niggas do what they want to, and busta niggas do what you're doin
I went from rags to riches, bagged bitches, Jags and 6's
To droppin a solo album that's sellin more than the last shit did
I got the streets and ave's addicted
??? Swiss accounts, drunk as fuck in the stretch narrow strippers

	Real playaz do what they want to
	(Real playaz)
	Suckaz do what they can
	(Real playaz)
	Real playaz do what they want to
	(Plow!)
	No time for strugglin
	(Ha-ha-ha-ha, Thugged Out, fool)
	Real playaz do what they want to
	(Real playaz)
	Suckaz do what they can
	(Check it out, nigga)
	Real playaz do what they want to
	(Plow!)
	Real thugz gon' hustlin

[ VERSE 3: Spice 1 ]
I've come from More Bounce To The Ounce to Short Dog and Roger Troutman
Yukmouth, we thugged out for the money and all the power
Real niggas do what they want to, suckers do what the fuck they can
Self-ma-made-mu-muthafuckin-man
Poppin my collar, li-livin the hustler's dream
Ballers fiend for cream, pockets bust out the seams
Franklin and Grant is my dogs, I die for em
(Die for em) C-cry, lie, ride for em (ride for em)
Nigga, I know you heard it through the grapevine
I was out here doin it way too live
Doin way too much, I'm tryin to touch 40 million bucks
And flip a jet with some ???, about 14
Flop through your hood, bumpin this shit, smokin sticky green
Thugs be hustlin, muggin and puttin muscle in
No time for strugglin, keep your mind on bubblin
You can't see me through websites, but I still got 'computer love'
For my nigga Roger Troutman, cause he was ridin with real thugs
Nigga
