[Mystic]
Yo

[Planet Asia]
West Coast.....
That's what we bout to talk about

[Mystic]
We talkin bout the West Coast

[Planet Asia]
They don't really understand what's crackin right now
It's a new brig, goin into this new millenium
You know what i'm sayin?how we do it

[Verse 1-Mystic]
Let's talk about Californ-i-a
If you ever came to visit wonder why you didn't stay
We got them, 'Wide Open Spaces" like them Dixie Chicks
Enough soldier's in the hood to really start some (shit)
It's where the sun always sets and the beauty never seases
Their's a war goin on, but it's more wit the police
It's were the pace is slow, it's somethin like in the south
When out of towner's try to rush they just runnin they're mouths
I love the hot days and the old school cars
White tee's and baggy jeans and barbeque's in the park
If you ain't rest here, then you would never understand
(You's a dedicated Queen)best believe that I am
I put up billboards butt-naked from the waist up
Which yo hands over each breast throwin the west up
And underneath, the capture would say, "don't you wish you were here?"
West Coast yay, yay

[Chorus: Mystic]
Cause everywhere I go
And everything I see
Makes me believe
Their's nothing like the West Coast
(Were you from?)
West Coast
And everything I do, the way I move
Is just because
I'm from the West Coast, West Coast

[Verse 2-Planet Asia]
Out west we rock stains and cuts
Coup's, and Regal's, 64's and Cadillac trucks
And we still sportin Guess?that's how we do it out West
Red or blue rags mutual brother's be still goin federal
You better know we pop collar's and chop game
Were mary jane's is the color of the incredible hulk
Summertime we top drop fresh out the chops shops
Out of control staright ballin baggy shorts no socks
Owin the block cell phones roamin the lot
We can ball in the in yacht, i'm talkin bout home of the rocks
Rockin a sporty spliff, we bumpin 40&amp;The Click
Too $hort, Dr.Dre or some George Clinton
Don't get it twisted cause you can even ask Mystic
(the bay got the best weed)and L.A. got the bitches
Tricks, mac's, hustla's, snitches, hoodrat killaz, drug dealer's&amp;thug nigga's
Were we at?

[Chorus]
Cause everywhere we go
And everything we see
Makes us believe
Their's nothing like the West Coast, West Coast
And everything we do, the way we move
Is just because were from the West Coast, West Coast

[Verse 3-Planet Asia&amp;Mystic]

[Planet Asia]
It ain't nuttin like the CA
Sunshine, women, water, and sand trees and the West Coast relay's
Straight from the North were paper chasin is art
Where they blast for cash and walk live
As a true and livin gangsta's

[Mystic]
Gangsta's O.G.'s the game is so fluid
Got us swaggin the steps like, "only we can do it"
True it, ain't no other golden state
We can't relate we heavyweights who demonstrate

[Planet Asia]
Let's be a soldier in the land of homocides and murder
Liqour store robberies and fast learners
And corrupt cops on the mission to bust off shots
Blue or flame dub you might just catch a hot one at the bus stop

[Mystic]
Yo Asia baby, we set the record staright
From thugs to fallen angel's, we elevate
And I know one day my soul will go to rest
Just put my ashes in the dirt in the west

[Chorus] - 2X

[Planet Asia Overlapping Mystic]
West Coast, Oakland, Fresno, Los Angeles
San Diego, you know what i'm sayin?
Seattle, Vancouver, West Coast

You know what i'm sayin?
Light green, old schools, pop ya collar
We don't sport curls no mo'
*Laughter*
We don't sport curls no mo'

[Mystic]
Yo spontaneous, spear more music, West Coast, West Coast
BIOTCH!
*Laughter*</pre>
