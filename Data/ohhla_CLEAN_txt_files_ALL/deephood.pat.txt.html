(Hook, Juicy J) [Project Pat]
We be deep in the hood, standin in cuts
Come through with that shit and we gon shoot'cha shit up
We be deep in the hood, standin in cuts
Come through with that shit and we gon shoot'cha shit up
[And our choppers go blocka-blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka]

[And our choppers go blocka-blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka]

(Verse 1, Juicy J)
Nigga FUCK yo hood, nigga FUCK yo set
I'm that killa with the rusty Tech
I'm the gorilla that'll break yo neck
I'm that nigga that'cha don't fuck wit
I always knew you niggas wasn't real
I always knew you niggas would tell
I always knew you niggas would fail
I hope you niggas know I'm still gettin this mail
And ridin on sixes, fuckin with bitches
Hustle all day man, gettin my issue
Buy sellin dope, never workin that crystal
Walk up in the bank then pull out a pistol
Nigga I'll rob you, gimme that cheese
Gimme that car, nigga gimme them keys
A sawed-off pump, nigga you can get these
Bullets put a little color in ya white tees
Don't violate, and the guns get bigger
I'm from the North, straight real street nigga
Haters gon hate, y'all niggas ain't killas
So why you wanna put'cha self in front of my trigger?
That's suicide bruh, all covered up
Standin on the block, nigga all post up
You better hide the ho screamin it up
I'm takin out the trash nigga, dump-dump-dump!

(Hook, Juicy J) [Project Pat]
We be deep in the hood, standin in cuts
Come through with that shit and we gon shoot'cha shit up
We be deep in the hood, standin in cuts
Come through with that shit and we gon shoot'cha shit up
[And our choppers go blocka-blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka]

(Verse 2, DJ Paul)
Standin in the cut
With the mask and the pistol grip (Grip-grip-grip-grip)
Pussy nigga best not slip
Desert Eagle, short nose, in my fuckin draws ho
Pull that shit, it's like a remote, it'll make yo little ass pause ho
Crawl ho, like a motherfuckin dog ho
That's what'chu gon be in yo next life, ain't gon be no tomorrow
May I borrow your life? Credit cards and ID's?
Shades, watch, and rings? House keys and cars keys?
Nigga this the hate, you shoulda stayed afraid
But you had to turn 'fraid, now you gon turn in yo braid
You gon turn on yo face, and lay it on the concrete
Patna this the end, you shouldn't have turned down the wrong street

(Hook, Juicy J) [Project Pat]
We be deep in the hood, standin in cuts
Come through with that shit and we gon shoot'cha shit up
We be deep in the hood, standin in cuts
Come through with that shit and we gon shoot'cha shit up
[And our choppers go blocka-blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka]
[And our choppers go blocka-blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka]
[And our choppers go blocka-blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka]
[And our choppers go blocka-blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka]

(Verse 3, Project Pat)
They know I'm real wit it
Don't play, will get it
Off with his head, fifty shots, bet I will hit it
Suckers couldn't deal with it so they started tattlin
Snakes that I broke bread with started rattlin
Paddlin my head above water, knock yo doors in
Got the boy for two cakes, talkin bout he gon' do me in
Sniper rifles, desert rifles with bullets inside 'em
Shoot niggas mama's houses up to bring 'em out of hidin
Playa I ain't hidin, I'm Cypress Garden hallways
The crack in my hand, shotguns, and them SK's
I stays off in the dark, off in them cuts
The boys car turned in the lot, and we shot it up

(Hook, Juicy J) [Project Pat]
We be deep in the hood, standin in cuts
Come through with that shit and we gon shoot'cha shit up
We be deep in the hood, standin in cuts
Come through with that shit and we gon shoot'cha shit up
[And our choppers go blocka-blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka]
[And our choppers go blocka-blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka]
[And our choppers go blocka-blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka]
[And our choppers go blocka-blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka]</pre>
