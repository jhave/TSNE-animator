[Intro: Ginuwine]
Yeah, *humming*, listen baby

[Chorus 2X: Ginuwine]
Uh huh, baby I got big plans
The big ring, the small hand
A big cake, a bridesmaid, a best man
One day, we gon' have all that

[Ginuwine]
Girl I know we just met tonight
And this may seem like a lie
But, I'm not the player type
Guess what? Normally you wouldn't find me
Under the crowd of lights, in search of a love in life
But you shakin' that stuff right
I think I should make you my wife

[Chorus 2X]

[Ginuwine]
You probably think I'm tryin' crush tonight
Cuz I got a look of lust, like crust in my eye
No matter what I say, keep it tight
Keep it away from me like Superman and kryptonite
You see I'm not thinkin' short term, I've learned
Givin' everybody turns, can I like a back burn
Oh, you got this lover wanna beg to earn, oh baby

[Chorus 2X]

[Ginuwine]
I know it sounds boo, I ain't even known you two
Days and I'm open to, the point that I propose to you
Must think I'm some kind of fool, don't you
You can call it what you're thinkin'
But I'm thinkin' we gon' jump that broom

[Method Man]
Back-seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Her neck and wrist all froze, I'm trynna catch a cold
Clippin' the trey, we sippin' away
On that 'Ze, innovations, slowin' slippin' away
Ain't life funny, don't nothin' move but that money
Oh boy, honeys, lookin' like Playboy bunnies
They whole swagger, that be the type that I go after
That get more attention cuz they ass is more fatter
And every day gotta have a, but I ain't trynna make her unconfy
Or cramp her style like a monthly
How many women want a man, with big plans
Big feet and big hands, ya'll understand
Why big daddy wear the big pants, I'm big boned
And if this symbolizes my life, I live long
My funny valentine, won't you be mine
Fifty grand on the wedding band, let it G-Wine

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
