[Verse 1]
Everybody fin to die, by the hands of the dark angel adjust
Snatching your breath, till it dims up your chest
How much pain, can I manifest
When I come to wreck, ripping through your flesh techs
My killers you'll never see, invisible invisible are we
Unseen like ghosts, strike like infrared beams make toast
We smoke the most, but never bump the most
Our figgas unleash like ropes, around throats
Better feel the attack, cause we cloak in the image of smoke
Leaving motherfuckers broke like a king of jokes, mercy
I know not of a feeling, but the thriller
Of a killer gets my adrenaline rushing
Never stopping, watching niggas dropping
More breaking blood gushing, I done opened the wounds
As I destroy cities with typhoons, and masoons
Your doom has awaited, all your mercy's forsaken time to die
Gotta kill them all, every nigga fin to fall when I kill them all
Found them up in bombs, ywith stomach punches
Yelling and running, K of dynasty coming

[Verse 2]
Mortuless contender, Guerilla Maab member I be
It'd be an epidemy, hoes wanna get rid of me
Fin to be, found dead and deceased
This ain't no game, ain't a damn thing changed
Cause I came, to bring the pain
Glock ass still fits, running on they head
while they play it, I rise up in chains
Hag in here, hag in here more deadly than anyone's intention
It had to be, more casualties
While I'm in more blemishes, than fatal inflictions
Slice them up like a wolverine, but I use a machete and a guillotine
Wanna stop like Akeim, on my god damn dream
And now mark and ass niggas, recognize my team

[Hook - 4x]
Murderer in me, I love to see you bleed

[Z-Ro]
The murderous feeling, is killing your kin
And tripping them niggas up, with a 4-5
Hit the ground and running bud, then I probably bumping in blood 
A fast thug fin to lose his life, motherfucking nigga from Texas
Steady with the dumb plexers, by the hand when I'm kicking your ass
And everybody better ball on
Cause I fuck around, and y'all gone and a nigga like me
Cause I'm blessed with a tight 22's, AK-47, 3-57, Mac 11
Balling and and a 25, bulletproof vest and a sharpened shank
Motherfucker your body gone stank, I'm flawless
Swinging and leaving them jawless
One of these niggas, are about to bleed
Running with the big dog, follow my lead
They following they mama straight, when we
Put him in the streets I'm a regular competitor 
To the niggas, that I want to act surely
Everybody wanna live, let the early bird get the worm
Run up in the corner store bright early
Even though I be hanging with thugs
Giving mean mugs, and I do a lot of drugs till I pass out
When I smell a dirty rat, up all in my motherfucking face
I'm hunting they, motherfucking ass out
When I be stepping and pulling my whip
And I'm ready to go to war, with them niggas
That be stepping and pulling back, they fucking up grind
It's going down, load the clip in the gun and I'm making them run
A gorilla nigga evermore buck and he died, but who was the nigga
That's talking down, don't really want me to get an attitude
I'm slapping haters up out the niggas, that think of my trigger
Won't be getting no automatic beatdown, but that's what I live for no mercy

[Hook - 4x]

[Verse 4]
Walking the land, of a naked world 
Looking down, up on my enemies in vein
With a mind full of deadly games, I'ma serve your aim
Shouldn't of killed putting holes in your frame, feeling no remorse
As deadly force overcomes my thugs, so bare witness
Sense of relentless vengeance, and 24 victims of wickedness
Out the hills of homicide, cause everytime I pull a whip enclosed
I can hear the sounds of bodies, from the victim of 17 and reloads
Did you really believe, that you could platinum-sieve a nigga like me
I was born to murder the world, but killers and G's and evil deeds
It'll be a whole lot of fly bringing
Some saying, if you run up on me the wrong way
I'ma be forced, to pull a AK
Bust your ass in the head, when the lead spray
No I'm not lying, I know you the fourth guy
To a region in mouth, no time to shine
You the dead victim of reincarnated, man for real I show no mercy
