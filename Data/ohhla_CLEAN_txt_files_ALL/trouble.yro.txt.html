Man, that's what I'm tal'n bout right there
They say this what it take to wrote songs like this, come on let's go
Oh what you thinking huh, yeah you right
I see ya, let's go

[Yung Ro]
A young mother got kids, growing up on her own
And her baby daddy gone, so she all alone
And even though we was po', we had a good life
Wasn't changing for the world, cause I love the hood life right
You shoulda seen, Lil' Ro
Flat top with a part, borrowing sugar from next do'
But oh the rent's due, plus you got money to pay back
The others lent you, and what's this letter that they sent you
Talking bout we pass due, pass out
And what's eviction mean mama, I don't wanna leave the house
Boy go and shut your mouth, we gon do what we gonna
To make it and we did, I got no choice to love mama
And I know, you think nobody cares
Nobody tries like you, and nobody's there
But you right, because it's me and you
So when you think nobody cares, you know who to look to ya know

[Hook - 2x]
Nobody knows the, trouble that I've seen
No-body knows my, sorrow

[Yung Ro]
Nobody knows my sorrow, it's like my heart seems hollow
But think about it, it really woulda took a right tomorrow
I got a heart mayn, that's bigger than me
But sometimes I can't decide, between this trigger and me
It's like it's bigger than me, I got a nigga in me
That's both bitter but sweet, and he be hitting that sweet
Get in the street, and just won't listen to me
I'm on some soul searching, trying to find the middle of me
Listen to me, it get hard everyday
I talk to God and I pray, and I just talk and I say
Whatever on my mind and heart, I'm trying to find my start
Ready to go, but I can't find my part
I grind and walk, because patience is a virtue
I'm speaking from experience, running fast will hurt you
Plus nobody will help, that's why we named our crew
And don't nobody cares, and know who to look to for real

[Hook - 2x]

(*talking*)
You gotta smile, through it all though man
You can't let that shit, get you down man
Hard times, come for a reason
Smile, and stick together</pre>
