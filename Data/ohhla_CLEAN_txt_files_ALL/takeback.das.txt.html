Song:   Take it Back
Typed by: davpaul@dove.net.au

Intro:

One for the treble, two for the bass
	P-M-D let's rock this place

[Parrish "PMD" Smith]
Return lies the power, try to push up and get devoured
To pushin power, black Explorer with the Eddie Bauer
XL, el reefer puffer sells
My name ring bells and my vocal tracks the third wails
Dwell, stale mad plus I make now
No details, first-class flight with the females
EPMD-dot-com, spread as e-mail
Stocks retail, push the quality S-T-L
You know the scoop now when I swoop down
Blast or shoot now, Hit Squad set the route down
from Hot 9-7 to 1-0-6 daily mix
Parrish Smith handlin biz like a clerk, kid

Break:

DAS EFX (are the best)
(Rock the speaker) D-E-F-X

[Drayz]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I riggity-roll when I rock, rock when I roll
Like DMC it's the Devastatin Mic Control
I never fold under pressure, time to get ill
Diggy Das hold it down, kid, you know that we're real
I rolled up, strolled up, put my cigarette out
Peep shorty on my left tryin to figure me out
'How to get up in that ass?' what I'm thinkin about
In the biggity-black Benz just diggin her out
B-boy style (what what??), you know we're all wild
Biggity-back from the sewer, check the profile
The doe-getter, the show-ripper, the flow-setter
My flow sicker, keep it drunk like some liquor

Break

[Skoob]
Yo, yo, yo
Hit Squad, usu-al suspects who bust necks
Love sex, wriggity-wreck these thugs and roughnecks
In these, dark streets (yo yo), my Squad creep
Mob deep, discharge thee and leave him on the concrete
By the light I got chicks that sound alright
They buy me ice, porbably in the phone books of Heidi Fleiss
Abara-cadabara, turn skin to battlescars
In your face like [BREAK] Alomar
nasty like caviar, glass MC's I shatter y'all
Lyrical sabotage, peace to Aguilar
Roll l's for my thuns from the slums to the town
(Brooklyn) Where I'm from, got me numb to the world
