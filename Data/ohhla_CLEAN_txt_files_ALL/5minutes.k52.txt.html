Song:   5 Minutes (In the Garden)
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I got 5 minutes 5 minutes left
Five minutes till the soldiers till they bring me to my death
So very close just to breathe my last breath
As I'm here in the garden I felt the heave of my chest
My disciples are asleep and they rest
And they can't seem to see just what be coming next
Through the trees the soldiers speed from the west
Getting closer and closer for me to arrest
I see blood drops like beads in my sweat
They run down like a crown right down on my head
I'm laid on the ground face down like I'm dead
Crying out to you Father let me pass what's ahead
They pound the nails in my hands the hands and my legs
As the time runs outs then I hang and I bled
They are coming down I understand what you said
So with 4 minutes left this is now what I did saying..

Not my will but let your will be done

I got 3 minutes 3 minutes left
3 minutes till the soldiers bring me to my death
I can hear them loud and clear closer then I guessed
While Judas is coming down with the crowd and the rest
They don't even understand right now what this is
They don't know who I am what I have just to give
For ever man every girl every child every kid
See my death has been planned so many can come to live
See I know that I got just a few minutes then
Then they'll come and they'll grab me its the beginning of the end
See I wont make a sound see I won't even defend
Myself to the crowd now I'll go just with them
Cuz I came for this now I came for they sin
I came to lay my life down then I'll take it up again
2 minutes I'll be bound and I'll face what's ahead
With the words from my mouth came out then I said

I got 1 minute 1 minute left
1 minute till the soldiers gone bring me to my death
I can hear all there voices its like a 100 feet ahead
I can see all the torches now I know what is next
I'll be beat and tortured then struck on my head
Forced to carry the cross and I'll be lead
Up a hill to be killed then I'm left now for dead
But now it's not my will Father I want yours now instead
And so I pray won't you please let this cup pass from me
See I want what you want that's all I want for me
Now I was just betrayed for some fast money
But the ones that you gave they could never snatch from me
Now my life that I gave see I gave it all away
And I'll be buried in a grave but I'll come back Sunday
I was born in a cave but I'll come back one day
But the time's now up they coming now for me</pre>
