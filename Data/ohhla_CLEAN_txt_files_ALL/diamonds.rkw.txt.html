[Raekwon]
Call me the flyest jewel thief in the town jewelry nympho with info 
All I need is three hold me down where the joints at chill
Its one big rockless glass And its blue play it low when we snatch that
Rock your black outfit kid Im going out kid you all mouth kid 
Be the driver chill out kid Snatch the glass the we all on hold on Lord
Who holding it who bought the idea duke Its over with
No funny guy business what is this its just realness 
Its only us who willing to steal this 
Got my whole life on it Mans wife on it throw my black Nikes on it
With sons ready to Ike for it my position is contain yal 
Sort of like dope fame on yal 
Blowing game on yal Lets get this paper
Start vaporizing think about legalizing 
Plus you went wrong now im Penalizing

[Chorus 2x: Chip Banks] 

Diamonds, grande y azul
Aiyyo we got chopo
And you can get some too

[Raekwon]
Yelling out asta la vesta last name masesta mean feon smoke with feces
Publicize this im go rise don in disguise 
that will throw his arm out of five that fly
Jewel specialist fool specialist 
Move like Professionalist strengthen paper excellent
Might be painting your town 
Throw the drink down blowing it real-estate style
Feel my weight now Chilling healthy 
and came up game up tore the frame up
Got to vote for the mayor later 
Snatch something I believe in some call it thieving
But I call it extra dough on the weekend 
Me and my family breezing so much ice its Freezing
the Dean switching up for a reason out of nature we be g'ing 
Some of these spots Korean That saten gleam got me peeing??

[Chorus 2x: Chip Banks] 

We get chop dough?
And you know its true
Ayo we get chop dough
And you can get some to

[Raekwon]

Ayo the topic is laying in the tropics ill ass clique to rock with 
We deligating on the block kid money invested in a deal
Lets stress it on the real side burning big phills holding bills
Technique Made us all meet Made me sit back repeat each
Started from the fame of the week 
This is glory mandotory phat dough
Rocking my hand to bring cash to support me

[Chorus: 2x]</pre>
