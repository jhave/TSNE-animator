Song:   Never Had A Friend Like Me
Typed by: OHHLA.com

Never
You ain't never had a friend like me
Believe dat
Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
See at night I watch the sky
I take another breath
I smoke my Newport to the butt
Like it's the last motherfucker left
Just me and you evading enemies
Let you get my last shot of Hennessy
Ain't never had a friend like me
Remember memories so vividly
Was once a little dust kicker now becomes a G
Who can I call when they all fail
Collect calls to my Dogz from the County Jail
Sendin' me mail
Heard the blocks in the same shape
Ain't nothin' changed
Niggaz slangin' at the same place
The same faces
We suppose to alwayz hate our foes
This lifestyle is forever
Watch the game unfold
Shedding Crocodile tears
Just got Life plus
And you wonder if these white judges like us
Just Stay Strong
We'll appeal
Nigga You'll be free
Down with cha to the very end
Cause you ain't never had a friend like me

[Chorus X2]
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemies your enemies
Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My Enemies your enemies
Cause you ain't never had a friend like me

How can I be blamed
Forgive me Lord I'm insane
In search of fame
Won't hurt to change
Follow in foot steps of past dealers
Equipped with ski masks
No witnesses, as we blast fearless
Reckon now they feel us
In this act of war
more casualties
no survivors
Any man the defies us
Quickly dies
Cuz we Ridahs
In my quest for chips
We wear vest
Equipped with automatic fire
We reply when my enemies trip
Me and you against the nation
Whispering while we conversatin'
Cuz niggaz died over information
How much more can we take?
Expect us all to wait
The world ain't ready for us yet
So lets make Clinton pay
(haha)
They never wanted us to make it
Everything that we posses
We had to fight and take it
I think the president is smoking weed
Bumpin' his beat
Makin' a livin' out of my misery
Till he got a friend like me

[Chorus X2]

Promise to visit
I know it's rough in your cell
Receiving mail to the county jail
This is hell
When I was young
I could picture livin'
In Luxury
So how the fuck did I end up in prison?
Fuckin' snitches
They got me crossed by my own side
I found him by his self
No drama, he alone die
Nobody cry
Should have never testified
You got my nigga 25
So now I sacrifice your life
Help to separate me and my dog
Broken ties
Why the fuck should I let you live?
When I'm dead inside
Rapid fire my delivery
I'm bustin' at their whole crew
Nigga remember me
Hit up my Outlaw set
Then throw my pistol in the ocean
Ditch my ski mask
And get to straight coastin'
It's visitin' day at San Quinton
Always there to see your closest row dog
Cuz You ain't ever had a friend like me

[Chorus X4]

[Small Chorus X2]
Come after us, best be complete
My enemies your enemies
Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My Enemies your enemies
Cause you ain't never had a friend like me

You ain't ever had a friend like me
