Song:   Jah Didn't Kill Johnny
Typed by: bradbur4@msu.edu

Yeah
Holla at your boy (Holler at your boy)
New shit I do remember (Holler at your boy)
Go back a few weeks on this one (Go way way back)
This life ain't fair but for some of us, yeah (Life is easy)

This song right here going out to a childhood mentor of mine
Father John, huh, holla
Touched me as a kid, I want you to know (Holler at your boy)
I'm still feeling you (Holler at your boy)
uh huh (Life is easy)

Jah didn't kill Johnny (uh uh)
He had a date with death
It was a slow train coming (uh huh)
And we've all got a train to catch (say what?)
But Lord, take your filthy claws off the rest of my friends
That is, of course, if they ain't already dead. (hell no)
I make no demands (no demands). I just make amends. (make amends)
I make my bed and I'm a lie in it
But before I die...please...don't take anymore of my friends
Please don't take anymore of my friends. (life is easy)
The smoke didn't kill Johnny (kill Johnny). The drink didn't kill Johnny (kill Johnny)
The junk didn't kill Johnny (kill Johnny). And the women didn't kill Johnny
Was it the road? (I don't know.) Was it rock and roll? (I don't think so.)
But God, God, God...would never...kill...Johny Cash
He had a train to catch
He had a date with death
And we've all got a train to catch
Life is easy. Holler at ya boy. Life is easy. [repeat]</pre>
