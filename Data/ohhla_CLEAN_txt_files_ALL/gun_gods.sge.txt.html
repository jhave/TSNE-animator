[Verse One]
Does nothing shine unless it's insane enough?
Adjust your rhyme to talk about cocaine and snuff
I-I-I-I don't trust your kind cause you smoke too much angel dust
So when I Busta Rhyme I get +Dangerous+
Plus I crush your spine and turn your brain to crust
When I thrust my mind, get profane and cuss
On every fuckin' line, who's Sage? 
Let's discuss
Cause it's such a crime he's a stranger to your lust
The
Secret Service agents must
Go Against all Machines with Rage and disgust
We'll make you rust with saliva and spit
The
Stage will get rushed if your rhymes are counterfeit
Uh
A major plus is if I like the sound of it
Strange enough, you don't know how to get down
So turn it down a bit
Now admit
Sex scenes with wet dreams of fantasies are extreme
My next ? of visual profanities
Of individuals who can't handle these
Were sent to slip
Self censorship
So they say, "Mind your manners please."
Yet, when the grandma leaves she returns with damaged knees
I'll let her tickle ivories when I laid her on piano keys
You'll know it's me when I Poetry Slam MCs
I keep a safe distance cause they got the MC Shan disease
Plus they're all about the Puff and Hammer steez
Nastradamus prophesied about these commercial calamities 
Make 'em run like how gang colors of a washed bandanna bleed
Get in my B-Boy stance and freeze
From New York to Los Angeles 

[Verse Two]
Now I travel from South Park to North Drive
Cuttin' off guys who talk lies
Sayin' they do walk by's with four fives
Frontin' like they big potatoes
I know they small fries
You can tell they watch their own noses grow
Cause they have crossed eyes
They went from sellin' beans to eatin' pork pies
They lost inside
They should force some pride and then reorganize
IT all resides right outside where abortion lines
I'm heading out
Watch my swollen member that be missin' foreskin rise
Hopefully soon, my inner cold war dies
Secretly, I still look at Russians as if they be all spies
Steppin' in and out of parties, waitin' for a door prize
It's rough between your girlies soft thighs
I'm swatting horse flies
That's access authorization denied
Plus my adult key doesn't work in holes that wide
Hoes that lied about their promiscuous past 
You know I dissed you and laughed
After that I'll quiz you in math
Split you in half like an atom/Adam
But we on the Eve of destruction
I had 'em
Leavin' the function
Before it started
They all departed
Sayin', "Y'all are retarded"
From community colleges to the halls of Harvard
It's sort of bothered
The side of me
That wanted to be a part of society
It's a human need
Too indeed
Why don't you go ask Mazlow
The eye in his pyramid 
Caught a cataract from my battle rap
If you have a gat, buck a shot
Those who hold microphones know how to blow up the spot
Y'all fuckin' sluts ain't hot
Turn it up a notch
You ain't a chicken you just cluck a lot
Cover up your crotch</pre>
