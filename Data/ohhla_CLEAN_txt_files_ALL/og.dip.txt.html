[Intro]
SAGA! DAMAGE! YES SIR
J.R Writer....to all of my g's coast to coast
FLACO THE GREAT!

[Hook]
I'M A REAL O.G (YOU AIN'T HEARD ABOUT ME?)
I'M A REAL O.G (J.R WRITER NIGGAAAA)
I'M A REAL O.G (YOU AIN'T HEARD ABOUT ME?)

[J.R. Writer]
I been the hardest with them bars of piff, you could tell JR is sick
Pardon prick, we started this...you can never harm a dip (never)
You niggaz harm-a-less, you would never harm a tick
I ain't too happy but ya girl give me the marvelous
I'm a quarter brick, something you would jog to pitch
This is that lean boy, you still got ya starter kit
I ain't bothered with...these niggaz you see talking
When we ride past, same niggaz you see walking
It's just sickening, I be listening
They rap about they man fucking ride that they sitting in (get some wheels!)
They ain't whipping em, nor stick-shifting 'em
All his broke ass know how to do is GET IN EM
You's a slouch nigga glue up ya mouth (shut up!)
I copped a Charger way before you ever knew it was out
STOP!...you was never hot, I'm a 100 times better ock
Yeah your up, so up...I bet you that you'll never drop

[Hook]

[J.R. Writer]
Now...I got these bastards hating cause I'm in an Aston racing
Switch lanes, cross 'em over like I'm Gary Payton
Don't know my way around? The wrenches ain't aggrevating
I'll have a whole conversation with my navigation!
You move sloppy, hopping off a Ducatti?
I'm bout to make my 2nd car a Bugatti
It's true mami, tear seats, blue body
1.2 ocky, since Jim copped that new Maesi (Maesaerati)
You dude's throppy, I'm paid cause I'm nice
You will never ever see a day in this life
I keep K's for the fight.....so when I say give me "my space" no I don't mean a page on a site
The K that I spray out you'll lay with the mice
We paid out, I can get you grey for a price
Look take my advice......or lay in the river
Don't you dare say my name if you ain't a good swimmer!
