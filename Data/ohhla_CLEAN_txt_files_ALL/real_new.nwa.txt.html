[Intro: DJ Yella]
Every motherfucker always asks: how did N.W.A. get started!!
We don't know how it got started
Fuck that question, you know what I'm saying?
It's the same bullshit over and over
How did we get started?
How did we first meet?
 
[MC Ren]
Prisoner like a hostage
Yo, you should've covered your motherfucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause you was a sucker
And your ass up high so I can kick the motherfucker
Don't try to hang, you best avoid it
Cause my foot will be so far up your ass, you'll get hemrroids
Before you try to fuck with Ren
I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting the size 10
 
[Dr. Dre]
First come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the world of the motherfucking Hip-Hop maniac
Brainiac, so what you ought to do is step the fuck back
But how the fuck you think your rap would last?
With your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick, you motherfucking carbon copy
 
[MC Ren]
Falling deep in the drums for many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran the hundred miles
Cheating and not beating, the crowd are kept seating
But weak motherfuckers biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
And got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggaz pick up your record is cause they thought it was us
 
[Dr. Dre]
Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do
You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you?
You can't harm me, alarm me
Cause we're the generals in this fucking Hip-Hop army
The niggaz with attitudes, if you didn't know
We blow, flow and then move slow from the get Go
Yo, tie us to take it
Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in
 
[Chorus: Eazy-E]
It's the real thing
You are now   ----&gt; Dr. Dre
Real, real niggaz, niggaz
 
[MC Ren]
You can run but you can't hide, you know I'm a find you
Cause a nigga like Ren, is only two steps behind you
Don't look back, because you're shaking and all scared
A nigga in black, can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep with the lights on, forget that the Mic's on
Don't step on my motherfucking stage without Nike's on
Don't say it's psycho, and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up, when I let the right blow
 
[Dr. Dre]
All these niggaz with the gibber gabber
But couldn't kill a fly with a motherfucking sledge hammer
Gangsters in black are out there
But only because, yo, it's the shit that we wear
On my motherfucking dick
But I'ma love it when you drop like a motherfucking brick
So, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead
You'll get a motherfucking bullet in your forehead
 
[Eazy-E]
Black, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see
A little street wise nigga, you know me
Rolling with some real niggaz playing for keeps
But you motherfuckers know who run the streets
With that hardcore Hip-Hop rap shit
[MC Ren] Now how much harder can another nigga get?
Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us
[MC Ren] Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please
Since you're on the dick, why don't you drop to your knees?
Cause I'm the motherfucker that's out to kill
Eazy-E, a nigga that's real
 
(Timed bomb count down*) 
 
[Break: DJ Yella]
Real niggaz, straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without a second thought
And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught
So if you're talking shit about the niggaz in black (*Explosion*)
Bow down to the King's and Raider hats
 
[MC Ren]
They played out, that's what niggaz were chanting
One nigga left and they said: we ain't happening
People had thought, we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit
Yet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record comes, I'll come like a fucking bump
Asking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb
You're on the dicks of four niggaz not one
And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up
Because if I let you slide, it's just cause you lucked up
Don't come in my face again, because I'm a floor you
And if you're a bitch, I'ma fucking ignore you
Because my attitude is a little bigger
Cause MC Ren is one of the Real Niggaz
 
[Dr. Dre]
Lost in a motherfucking world of madness
Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that gladdest
Sucking motherfuckers like you, making whack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When I'm expressing, standstill like you're full of Rigor Mortis
Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that's smart
A nigga that's paid; to say what others are scared to play
We started out with too much cargo
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo, N.W.A., criticized for what we say
But I'ma do the shit anyway
Cause I'm the motherfucking doctor, never faking
Yo, Yella, kick the motherfucking break in
 
[Chorus: Eazy-E]
It's the real thing
You are now   ----&gt; Dr. Dre
Real, real niggaz, niggaz
Yeah, motherfucker, it's the real thing
You are now   ----&gt; Dr. Dre
Real, real niggaz, niggaz
 
[Hook: MC Ren w/ echoes] 
N.W.A. - Straight Outta motherfucking Compton
Taking over shit in all of the 1990s
Yo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E and I am MC Ren
Yo, N.W.A. taking over this motherfucker y'all</pre>
