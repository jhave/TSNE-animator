Song:   Never Deny You
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

All the love that we share could never just disappear
And all that we've been through I believe in you

I will never deny you

Friends said to me one day I should forget you
But my experience say what we have is true

I will never deny you

Hey Judas they will betray you
Thomases they will doubt you
Peters they will deny you
But I will never deny you

I

All the love that we share could never just disappear
And all that we've been through I believe in you

I will never deny you
Will never deny you will never deny you oh I</pre>
