MF
The world's waiting
MF 
There'll be no hesitating
MF
The world's waiting
MF 
There'll be no hesitating

[Verse 1]
No time for stalling, your calling is calling
I'm here to give you word that you're the word (MF)
And the word must be heard (MF)
Even if it hurt to be heard
Even if it hurt to lead the herd
Lead for others be hard
Hearts of brothers be hard (MF)
But never forget your b-boy
Guiding your path will be God
Been bad in the past so be good
Flesh is weak so be strong
Life on the planet won't be long (MF)
Before you know it you'll be gone (MF)
But the work put in will be done
Word of many have passed that fact
But you're the first that rap

MF
The world's waiting
MF 
There'll be no hesitating
MF
The world's waiting
MF 
There'll be no hesitating
MF
The world's waiting
MF 
There'll be no hesitating
MF
The world's waiting
In this fight you will defeat Satan

[Verse 2]
He was hard to see, he shined bright
I squinted to look at him, used all my might
To try to see his face through the jade colored light
I said "You said I'm the word, is that right?"
There's many other rappers all around this spot (MF)
Why me?, his response was "why not?"
Accept your gifts, spit fire make it hot
Accept when God tell you you're not
If that do occur I advise you do not
Play games with you know he do not
You gave into temptations, your mind wasn't steady
Before you wasn't ready
Know I have the music now to make them all bop their heads
I played this beat and then he said
"Yeah Twiz is dope and you sound really good on this track"
"All it need is some horns so move back"

MF
The world's waiting
MF 
There'll be no hesitating
MF
The world's waiting
MF 
There'll be no hesitating
MF
The world's waiting
MF 
There'll be no hesitating
MF
The world's waiting
In this fight you will defeat Satan
