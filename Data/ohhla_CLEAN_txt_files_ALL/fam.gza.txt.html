[RZA]
Yo, yea check it...yo, yo yo yo
Yo, if you think you can fuck wit the Wu Clan
Get ya nose swolled up like Toucan
If you think you can fuck wit the Wu Clan
You get ya nose swolen up like Toucan
If you think you can fuck wit the wu clan
you get ya nose swolen up like Toucan
Sam, and we don't give a damn
Bullets soaked in oil so the Tec can't jam
Sippin on Carribean run, cocanut juice
Smokin on that chocolate stick
Open up two bottles of that brass monkey on some drunkie shit
You R&amp;B fake rappers suck a monkey dick
I'm from back in the days
with the Christmas for haze
on my back, stripped out black
You like that?
Seven braids in my head
My girl stays in the bed and she love to lay the eggs

[Masta Killa]
Prepare for the mic onslaught swift with the sword
Slick Lord, holdin my weight homing abroad
The crowd roared for the peeps playing for the streets
I reeped and sewed, scriptures weeved and woved
Behold gold for the people equal
Fresh on the weekend
Wu-Tang, Biggie smalls live at the beacon
Backstage drinks on the house the show was bangin
Brothers Grey Goosin, Wu was Tanquerayin
Allah teaching schools in session
The Gods speakin
I'm just knowledging
Snake handshakes and fake hugs
Waiting for the hour to devour
and splatter ya heads of powder
I'm a slave to the rhythm
but never to a mental deaf and power
The hour has come
We got y'all eleven to one son
You done off, too late to break off
Tactics are hazardous to the health, bomb stealth
Rifle stay M-16, know what I mean?
Know what I mean?

[Break: Masta Killa  (both)]
Yo just what we (stand for?) Loyalty
What we strive for? Righteousness

Yo (strictly fam members only)
Yo, yo just what we (stand for?) Loyalty
What we strive for? Righteousness
what we live and (die for?)

[RZA]
Ayo ayo
Great minds think alike
We used to drink all night
Think about things thats wrong and how to make it right
Ice cold bottles of brass, time flashes
A hundred blunts passes
Before the God asked us
What's the square miles of the planet?
Why is the axis slanted?
How much is covered by water?
How much is granite?
True-I-Master-Equality
God body be flowing like the chi energy inside your artery
Faithful as a polished rock against a tank
The force of my wheel still kill shooting blanks
Just from the sound alone ya heads blown
Still scorin in the red zone you best of head home
or get thrown to the dead zone
Son we need to ill, interupt the Grammy show and teach the kids

[Break: RZA]
Yo Just', what we stand for?
What we strive for?
What we live for?
What we give for?
What we die for?

[GZA]
I grew up around block parties ready to rock
Behind a roll nigga wit my rhyme on cock
First shot first nigga who had shit to pop
My bad weather blew the feathers off a hundred flocks
Seventy precent goose, thirty duck
Get stuck if each link in ya chain is truck
Can't come in this rhyme cypha wit nine snipers
Charged off the juice from the pied pipers
Walk around B-Boys, DJ's, MC's
Through rap, never thinkin their ways of TV
It was strictly all about about magnificent rhyme clout
The R.E.C. Room, two dollars with the flyer, three without
Now his wigs pushed back, name's removed off the plaque
Too wild to reanact, with tax
Thats the price to pay, my goal is to aim and spray
My night is the same as day

[Chorus x2: RZA]
Yo Just', what we stand for?
What we strive for?
What we live for?
What we give for?
What we die for?
