[Kanye] Heh, what you gon' do? It's GOOD Music and G-Unit
[Banks] Yeah
[Kanye] Uhh
[Swizz] Vroom! Vroom!
[Banks] Banks!
[Swizz] Vroom, vr-vroom!
[Fabo]  Loso

[Swizz Beatz]
Ladies and gentlemen!
You know they mad cause I'm cause I'm cause I'm hood rich
You never ever ever seen a nigga good trick
You want a problem? Start it up (vroom-vroom)
Start it up (vroom-vroom) start it up (vroom-vroom)
Wait a minute (wait a minute)

[Lloyd Banks]
Uhh, big blue, hot and skinny shoe, cotton candy coupe
Hard knock, orphan Annie loop, off the stoop
Uh, play with me, see what the screamy do, my canary shoe
High beams pointed right at you, peek-a-boo
Uh, Benji paper made me hater-proof, all your fame reduced
Menáge-à-trois, purple haze and Goose, got me loose
Uh, kick my way in now I got the juice, Gucci bubble boots
Thousand kicks, couple hundred boots, gettin fuckin loot
My top down, I'm flashin on 'em
I'm passin all them, pull over and hit the hazards on 'em
The ratchet's on 'em, paid my dues now it's back to ballin
The rap's a boring dead man, I'll get the casket for 'em
I'm back performin, I bag 'em, break they back, don't call 'em
Look down on 'em like Dikembe, Patrick, Mourning
Cash is pourin, stunt stormin, got these bitches up
Camera phones capture everything that pictures don't (right)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz] + {Ryan Leslie}
You know they mad cause I'm cause I'm cause I'm hood rich
You never ever ever seen a nigga good trick
You want a problem? Start it up (vroom-vroom)
Start it up (vroom-vroom) start it up (vroom-vroom) {Start it up}
You know they mad cause I'm cause I'm cause I'm hood rich
You never ever ever seen a nigga good trick
You want a problem? Start it up (vroom-vroom)
Start it up (vroom-vroom) start it up (vroom-vroom) {Start it up}
Wait a minute (wait a minute)

[Kanye West]
Yeah... we keep these G's in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an Altoid case
They say good things come to those who wait
So I'ma be at least about an hour late
I'm so fresh bitch, I should be arrested
New Cody Chesnutt with my nuts, on your chest bitch 
She said, "Hey 'Ye," I said "Yes biiiitch"
Damn I'm only askin you a question
I met this MILF at the All-Star gettin action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
I'm a rock star, huh! Start it up
Start it up, huh! Start it up
So popular you should get a shot of us
Niggaz gon' take shots at us, that is only obvious
The first album I vomited, the second I colonic'd it
Ain't nobody fuckin with me, I platonic'd it
Bet I got some slippers on, bet niggaz gon' honor it
These ain't even real clothes, homie I'm pajama rich
Banks told me homie gon' switch the style up
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her I ain't payin tonight, I'm only browsin
She pulled her blouse up said it's free, I said "Wowzers!"

[Chorus]

[Swizz Beatz]
Ninja (Ninja) Kawasaki (Kawasaki)
Ducati (Ducati) my old Harley (old Harley)
Rock the party (rock the party) move your body (move your body)
What's up? (What's up?) Everybody! (Everybody)
Start it up (vroom-vroom) start it up (vroom-vroom)
Start it up (vroom-vroom) start it up (vroom-vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vr-vroom)

[Ryan Leslie] + (Swizz)
Start it up
Let's get it started, get it started, get it started
Yeah yeah (ladies and gentlemen!)

[Fabolous]
Plenty hate, they be takin shots, never penetrate
Money generate, if we ain't in the house, renovate
Tryin to eat, we ain't finna wait, where's the dinner plates?
B-M-W, ten to 8, Interstate
95, passenger, baddest bitch, in the states
Half Spanish, half Trini-day, complexion Henny straight
Y'all ain't got y'all business straight, track star finna skate
Time is money and I can't afford to be a minute late
It's time to make a movie let the haters watch
Diamonds spinnin 'round the bezel, that's tornado watch
My independent chick, I like my ladies Koch
She got a appetite for dick, I guess her plate's my crotch
That's soft as tater tot, lil' niggaz try me not
Under the wing, fried rice at the Chinese spot
I hear 'em talkin it but ain't really livin it
Opinions are like assholes, so who gives a shit?
