(D-Gotti talking)
We Po'ed up,  we showed up 
and we still rolling on choppas 
it ain't stoping know what im talking about
it's D-goti, wreckshop to tha grave
it's going down, mo-yo, feel this here baby

(verse 1: D-Gotti)
These blades are choppin'
And these babes are boppin'
Got a cup full of mud and my trunk is knockin'
Felling my FUBU 
Hollering what it do
Hitting circles throug the lot like im in a hula-hoop
Who the crew that stang these streets like bees
We the G's that be's and i'll flow from over seas
Hold the trees big moe while I split the optimo
In a wide body Benz-O going bout 4
Oh, the ex-o just hit me where it hurt
Im bout to jump down and flirt
And get up some skirts
Let the ice do the work
Put us up in the dentist
After we hit the lenards till they know who sent us
You can fuck 
but your ass can't stay and drank drank
Next morning we hooked up eating breakfast at the Frank's 
Doing the same thing we did the day before
Choppin the sceene and knocking down bad hoe's

(Chorus)
Chop-pas 
Rolling in my candy red car 
Roling on Chop-pas
Sippin a big daddy cup of barre
Chop-pas
I Gotta feel that Mo-yo 
Crawling through these city streets
Sippin on a what straight 4
And we rollin

(Verse 2: Big M.O.E.)
Down south, We rolling nation wide
Popped up mo-yo foregin ride
Put it down for that boy Po-yo
On the low low Im a young pro
In this game I ain't lame 
Rolling down on chops 
Smoking on the Killer Mary Jane
Coming down freestyle, playa buck wild
Big M.O.E. is a throwed child
Im a leave lean , stack my green
Everytime you see the moe im on the codine
Im out the damn tre, a playa don't play 
Bout to chop it up for them boys everyday
Choppa's, rolling on those choppa's 
Cha-cha-pas

(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Noke-D)
Chop Chop, When i hit the block
I told you once before that the shit won't stop
Wreckshop to the grave trunk pop make it say hey
Hello hi hey how ya doing 
Put the screw in your deck Throw up yo set,  
And go on break your neck cause the 20 inchs wet
And I bet that if we sip three whole eights 
Pop 1,2 a piece these hoes gone hate, MAN!!!!

(Verse 4: D-Wreck)
Wreckshop baby so playa made 
Im a let the top down let the sun hit the braids
Im a bleed these blocks till my heart beat stop 
Keep the streets on lock, cause the shit be hot
D-Wreck tote glocks, cause we tote  big knots
Methazyne on the rocks till my belly pop 
So clean when we shop, my car never stop 
Candy gleam off the drop make your girl flip flop
D-wrezay tell me how ya feel 
It's all about the scrill want a billon dollar deal
Noke-Deazy tell me how do ya feel 
Some get it how they love it but we get it how we feel
D-Wreck, Noke-D handle business the same
We fuck hoes and sip 4's cause we running this thang
Some thangs never change they remain the same
P-A-T and E-S-G and M-O-E gone bang

(Chorus 2x)

(Big M.O.E.)
