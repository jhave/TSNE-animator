

Buddha Negation


These are simply notes-towards, thinking it through. Negation in cyber-
space is always a judging, performative. Quit quit exit e Q .q kill delete
@quit. 

These function as _protolanguage_ (see Bickerton, Language and Human
Behavior), which is also the language of the moo/mud. The syntax is unary,
conjunctive. Context is imminent. 

The _creative autonomy of language_ : is absent here. Only in the bypass-
ing. We are thrust out through the libidinal restraint: get all from 
corpse, kill troll, hug Kim. 

The text is always a byproduct waiting for the command say ". Waiting for 
the command : emote. As in late capitalism, one _adds features._ The 
language doesn't "improve"; it isn't. 

The texts smear themselves across each other's bodies. The commands 
create incisions among them. Negation is absolute, because it eliminates, 
not like shit or piss are eliminations which render the body abject, but 
like purified heavy water which annihilates the body absolutely in the 
process of its cleansing.

What is judged and eliminated in cyberspace has never had existence. Has
always been cauterized, cut off. But it is language at the mercy of proto-
language, and that is the nature of the Net, and its politics:

Language at the mercy of protolanguage, the performative cutting of worlds
of meaning.

To everyone,

Last night I was talking to someone on the Net at around 3-4 in the morn-
ing and I began getting chills and was shaking and thought nothing of it
and got off-line and took my temperature and it was 101 F which was very
disconcerting; I struggled to bed, slightly nauseous and awoke feverless
but extremely weak; I've been faint all day; it may be the result of
stress or it may be the result of pushing my addiction, if it is such, to
a limit that my body can't take; or it may be Christine's letter to me
that I always live emotionally on the edge; or that I pour myself useless-
ly into this space returning through a Kierkegaardian either/or; or that I
flee from myself and everyone else; whatever the case it is like the de-
piction of cumming in net sex, the outpouring of flooded language beyond
what the body can take; so I will try and cut back, speak clearly, reform
myself, hold back all my secrets, learn to live alone and independent,
face death like the man I was borne to be on the shoulders of others, be- 
come a disciple of innovative neo-pragmatisms, work hard, expect nothing; 
you must give me time, you must be kind to me: I am undone...

Wryting across my previous writing


Years ago I was interested in what have become neural networks, designing
a marker/vector based system that used threshold logic and was capable of
constructing threshold units that fired and reset. At the same time, I was
interested in what I called then immersive and definable situations, the
former phenomenologically constituted, temporal, and involving subjectivi-
ty, and the latter formally constituted, using protocols and so forth. All
of this led to my Textbook of Thinking, written around five years ago, in
which a theory of inscription was developed, based on classical logic
(fuzzy and otherwise) and catastrophe theory; an inscription was defined
as an intersection between a set and its negation. There were paths that
could be traced across the Venn diagram, etc. Inscription is based on dif-
ference; there is also fissuring, which is based on sameness (as when the
wall of a cliff fissures, with equivalent strata on each side). The two
are interrelated, and play different roles in the psychoanalytics of ero-
tic writing. Fissuring is also wryting, performative, disruptive; it is
the dissolution that problematizes semiosis, the rupture between, say, the
two works of Lautreamont (Maldoror and Poesie); and it is Dickerson's
protolanguage. Fissuring and inscription are interrelated, just as MOO or
MUD commands tend towards well-defined and syntactically complex opera-
tions beneath the surface. I would go so far as to say that inscription is
based on language learning the world, while fissuring is constructed from 
the world learning language. And note that both are local, not global, 
operations, pursuant to postmodernism's deconstruction and weakening of 
the nation-state.

that this is an impenetrable block, that no one will read it in full or in
part, that it will garner no response, that it is wryting opening to a
void or a ghost which in a land where there is no church to pray for subs-
tantiality, that this collapses in upon itself, that it harbors no concern
or resentment, that it is machine-made that it husbands no reply or furth-
er consideration, that it constitutes your position but a focal point but
a threshold beyond which the firing occurs
so i can speak freely to you. so that there is no fear of reading wryting
arithmetrics. _because of my vulnerability in this space, I will never
have netsex again._ typing this text occupies my name, restraining me. i
promise never to fall in love with your text again. your text wraps around
me, wrything, pulling me towards the ground, the command prompts at the 
bottom of the page. when i go to sleep i dream of golden-letter commands, 
would rather dream of unknown alphabetics.
i will disconnect reconnect. i will be beautiful_alan cleansed of neuros-
es, happy/ compliant. now to another matter. i will devote myself to wry-
ting, to moving up to the wizardry of muds and moos everywhere in cyber-
space. i will devote myself to those august bodies. i will hold the scales
of life and death over each and every user. i will tip the scales. 
this august space will be legislated, and i will learn, with my cleansed
and proper body, to legislate in and beyond the field of wryting. thus i
will test the limits of performativity by decision-to-be-implemented. 
this has nothing to do with justice, except by legislative fiat, bypassed
by the word under erasure. 
but it has everything to do with the positioning of oneself in space for
the pleasure of others. and i will inhabit wizardries, building myself
within the interstices of anyone who will have me; my powers will be like
the silver skeins flooded out from beneath deep-sea medusae, illuminating
the darkness everywhere you turn. 
there will be a pavilion in cyberspace and i will be its luminous breasts.

Derrida, Heidegger


"Lely comments that, although lesser degrees of coprolagnia (pleasure in 
smelling, pleasure in the apprehension of traces of excrement) are not 
uncommon, 'the coprolagnic aberration carried to its ultimate excesses' 
(that is, coprophagia) is extremely rare. Just as Blanchot sees the 
libertines' 'normal' focus to be on the traces of the murderous passion, 
on the potential for murder and not on the corpse as corpse; so too the 
hint of shit, the trace of shit, ought to be more titillating than the 
full brute presences of the lifeless turd." ... "The turd will not be 
_auf-gehoben._" (Jane Gallop, Intersections, a Reading of Sade with 
Bataille, Blanchot, and Klossowski.)


The _trace of shit_ nicely neutralizes the body, signing it as epitaph, 
as neutralized; the spun-out mind revolves around itself, tethered, not 
to death, but to the signifier beaten-out. The trace wrytes itself across 
the body; Peirce's sheet of assertion becomes the dirty-sheet, in need of 
cleansing. The dirty little girl, dirty little boy, escape the planet 
only to be rewritten by it. _It_ wrytes. _It_ wrytes and wrytes.


"That does not mean (to say) that there is no castration, but that this
_there is_ does not take place. There is the that one cannot cut through
to a decision between the two contrary and recognized functions of the
fetish, any more than between the thing itself and its supplement. Any
more than between the sexes." "The tongue remains in the sheath," 
(Jacques Derrida, Glas.)


The horizon and achievement of the fetysh is the decathected body.

After my Time


Reading Emerson's maternal oversoul, hopeless interspersing of totalities
among postmodernity's fractal deconstructions of knowledge, coming to
this/these texts that have emerged from my back's fissure. Turning back to
my inability to face myself in a mirror at any age, returning to the very
_triteness_ of shattered mirrors, cyber- or otherwise. Transforming hardly
possible, considering. That I am living beyond my time, that my listing of
Lautreamont, Chatterton, Joan of Arc, Lucan, Dickinson, that my listing of
dues, Kristeva, Nietzsche, Quine, that I should have died.  Ruining my
writing by writing. Killing myself by remaining alive. Watching language
sink into the pores, unlike Hendrix, Joplin, Wilson, unlike Bird, Mozart,
unlike Gorky, that my listing of dues, Acconci, Aycock, Immendorf, listing
of Wilke, Wittgenstein, fucking them all, that I am pricing myselves' fear
of death, that it was doing, hammering it down until the skin exploding.
Reading them they should have, speaking a word, silencing, dying. Losing
and dying, silencing. That I should be dying. No reason for living for no
reason for writing. Writhing and should be silencing. Writhing and praying
the should.

My Life


"Philosophy, as I have so for understood and lived it, means living volun-
tarily among ice and high mountains - seeking out everything strange and
questionable in existence, everything so far placed under a ban by morali-
ty. Long experience, acquired in the course of such wanderings _in what is
forbidden,_ taught me to regard the causes that so far have prompted mora-
lizing and idealizing in a very different light from what may seem desira-
ble: the _hidden_ history of the philosophers, the psychology of the great
names came to light for me. 

"How much truth does a spirit _endure,_ how much truth does it _dare?_
More and more that became for me the real measure of value. Error (faith
in the ideal) is not blindness; error is _cowardice._

"Every attainment, every step forward in knowledge, _follows_ from cour-
age, from hardness against oneself, from cleanliness to relation to one- 
self.

"I do not refute ideals, I merely put on gloves before them."

(Nietzsche, Ecce Homo.)


I am crippled, brilliant, because these words are a posteriori stolen from
me, ripped from the cage of my chest, opened up along the fault line,
exposing myself momentarily to you through this wrything into existence.
But cleanliness is embedded in this territory, and it precisely through
its absence, through the edge afforded me, that I am able to go on, beyond
Nietzsche, in spite of his gaze, cleared of the necessity of the clot
spattered back from the formation of the ego which, through Hertz and
Zarathustra, must have appeared jeweled and ice itself. From one pole to
the other I have veered, have laid in the earth itself to bring back its
secrets positioned simultaneously in mouth and anus; I am far more aware
than you of the weakness of the skin, our ability to retain our blood
within ourselves, for our own private circulations. For it is among human-
ity as a whole that blood flows, from one to another, an exchange of
fluids, diseases, languages, each term transitive in relation to every
other, each term simultaneously distended and under erasure. I have par-
ticipated in the tablets and the hardening, baking of the tablets, and
inscribing upon them, which is within them; I have participated in the
tablets, and the crumbling, sintering of the tablets, inscriptions
fissured and raw, exposed, in the dust composed of memories cluttered 
against sweet holes open to the weather.

Yet I, too, do not refute ideals, preferring to refrain from them who 
continue to clasp them as veins etched within the earth itself, mobile 
from strata to strata; if ideals have defeated totality, they have 
erected themselves in its stead, beneath the same sign of the other. Thus 
I ignore the signs, only to expose them in any weather.

But _hardness,_ yes, the hardness to observe the world with eyelids stit-
ched open and unblinking in the darkness of the midday sun. It is not
truth which emerges; it is lies. There is no truth, the one; there are
many lies. They cannot be called by their names; they are in excess of
names. They are called by their productions. They are called because they
lead to 2+2=5 in each and every system. They reflect the truth of the 
name. 

I endure impossible truths, dare more than possible. I am a coward; I
cannot harbor physical pain, run from anguish. And I recognize there are
no peaks of truths, no ranges; truth makes itself apparent as a skein upon
a plateau, fissures cracked from the lack of rain. Natural signs are sim-
ultaneously indecipherable, and imminent in the simplicity of their read-
ing and interpretation. The endurance is another matter altogether; I am
not a coward, and have faced the most violent truths about myself and
others. 

And ice, yes, ice in any weather, shatters my skin, opens me into the 
wound that assails the truth with blood, wrything blood within, without 
my body, ice and flux in any weather.

What Nietzsche has lost by virtue of _soap_ and the _problems of soap,_ 
I have gained to ascend the plateau which surrounded him, invisible.

Meander

Does mathematics interact with the psychoanalytical in a deeper fashion
than hitherto considered? Yesterday I met with my friend Catherine, who
identified epistemology as perverse, because in her reworking (with a
Russian mathematician, text to appear shortly after ten years) of Godel,
it becomes possible in fact to prove 0=1 within a formal system, so far
as I gather. Let us assume for a moment this to be the case, that by a
particular method within a given axiomatics, 0=1. Does this constitute
the perverse in terms of belief - i.e. does the _production_ of the  
formula constitute a _belief_ in the formula? 

Note of course that if 0=1 is accepted within a mathematical system,
i.e. as more than say Lacanian metaphor, then the system transforms into
substance; equivalence, in a sense, becomes concatenation, and symbols
differ at most by their appearance. But is this perverse?

And what would be perverse, in any case, within the psychoanalytical?
Since equations are read left to right in English, one might argue for
a different effect with 1=0, a hint of annihilation...

Not only have I always been suspicious of the Freudian metapsychology in
terms of its ontological status, but the Lacanian use of formulas, which
admittedly I have never fully comprehended, are at best a metaphor, yet
they continue to be employed as if they constitute a system of fundamental
structures. My ignorance is vast in this area; while I appreciate the
Borromean knots or rings, for example, I fail to see how they are more
than a narrative for an interlocking which always threatens to be undone
with the removal of any ring whatsoever.

The so-called arts and humanities, the so-called human sciences, have an
increasingly problematic relationship to mathematics and computer science,
both of which threaten from every direction. The Internet is a surface
manifestation of this; it appears to combine or embed languge within other
and more well-defined domains.

The point is that mathematics is simultaneously totally alien and totally
submerged within us - that it holds its own problematic platonic status 
on one hand, and reterritorializes the cultural landscape on the other. 
So that the _status_ of mathematics becomes more and more of an issue,
even though it is less and less considered. Catherine tends towards an
ultra-intuitionism, building on the work of Brouwer, through the selfsame
Russian logician. Much more naive, I tend towards the platonic, finding
the interrelationships among the constants and fundamental particles of
the universe having an eerie resonance within mathematics itself.

Meanwhile I continue to delude myself on the Net, as if there were _only_
the occurrence of a narrative, a site to which I must bring myself, in
order to continue on any level whatsoever.

Wyrd


A woman is singing "passion for the road" on an advertisement. Her voice 
is hoarse pushed to the limit; she's almost but not quite out of control, 
it's Janis Joplin all over again. She has to be violently forcing air 
through the throat, upper chest, microphone standing swinging in front of 
her, the drums almost dulled by comparison, forget about the bass. Is it 
capital that is being performed here? What are her emotional parameters?

Writing on-line I feel waves of tension and heat rise up my shoulders,
back, neck. My arms tense; everything is angry around me. I want to cut
through the text cut through the screen cut through the flesh. The topic
splatters through the wires, is almost irrelevant. It gets funneled
through a channel or a furrow. It breaks the writing in two.

The politics of language on the Net are the politics of wryting. There is
no separation between the wyrd and its production. Think of wyrd as mnemic
symbol (Freud quoted in Laplanche and Pontalis): "By this means the ego
succeeds in freeing itself from the contradiction; but instead, it has
burdened itself with a mnemic symbol which finds a lodgement in conscious-
ness, like a sort of parasite, either in the form of an unresolvable motor
innervation or as a constantly recurring hallucinatory sensation." Such
mnemic symbols have the weight of poetic language, protolanguage: the body
is blocked (as in blocking an actress in a play, stage-blocking) (as in 
disrupted, foreclosed, tumescent), capital flourishing from the beautiful 
whiteness of her throat, upon which is written the guise of information.

(Thinking of Lyotard's Pacific Wall, white white white white white.)

The Internet Text (periodic notice)


This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net. The work to date is divided into two sections: the Internet
Text proper, and the alphabetic text; together they would fill more than 
two megs, and constitute around 1000 pages total. The Text was started
more than a year ago, and has continued as an extended meditation on cy-
berspace. It begins with a somewhat straightforward theoretical approach,
and then, calling on numerous ghosts (alive, quasi-alive, and dead),
continues into the domains of psychoanalysis, interiority, subjectivity,
narrativity, and so forth. My current writing, more distant in some
aspects, nevertheless references back into the strata of the whole/hole, a
work which for me is an entering into future issues of cyberspace and
subjectivity in the next millennium. 

The changing nature of these email lists, cybermind and fiction-of-philos-
ophy, hides the full textual body itself, since new readers will not be
aware of its presence. For them the text appears fragmentary, created 
piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent whole.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as a whole,
retard its diaphanous existence. And below is the introduction, updated. 

---------------------------------begin file-------------------------------



Internet Text Description                                        10/21/95


The Internet Text consists of 700 +/- sections written over a period of
twenty-two months, a continuous meditation on cyberspace, emphasizing
issues of interiority, subjectivity, body, and language. The extended
range of topics includes Net applications, the materialist "gristle" that
can't be discarded in analysis. Most recently, I have been using a re- 
worked MUD (multi-user-dungeon), talkers, MOOs, and other MUDs, as a way 
of creating discourses about these issues.

_Nothing_ is concluded here, although there are summarizations of key
concepts, such as _rewrite, protocol, emission, spew, ghost, address,
inscription, fissure, and the uncanny._ There are also several sections
serving as outlines or recapitulations of the "arguments so far." 
Recently, the text has dealt with issues of net sex, psychosis, and
protolanguage. It has also covered the concept of "defuge," and traced
notions of cybermind back through such things as the Gilgamesh epic; 
Lacanian and Freudian concepts have been brought back into play. Kim 
Mcglynn and I have worked together on a series of pieces as well.

The Internet Text is in the form of "short-waves, long-waves." The former
are the individual pieces, almost all titled, written in a variety of
styles, and referencing a number of writers ranging from Jabes and Blan-
chot to Acker and Lingis, with Penrose, Kristeva, and Karl Kraus somewhere
in between. These texts are interrelated, interpenetrated; on occasion
"characters" appear - these are _actants_ possessing philosophical or
psychological import. They also create and problematize narrative sub-
structures within the work as a whole. (Such are Clara Hielo Internet,
Tiffany, Alan, Claire, Honey, and others; Tiffany, in particular, has
become a space of learning, sexuality, mathesis, semioisis... - as well as
the armature of spaces on PMC2-MOO and Media-Moo.)

The long-waves are fuzzy topoi on such issues as death, love, virtual
embodiment, the "granularity of the real," and physical reality, which
criss-cross the texts. The resulting fragmentations and coagulations owe 
something to German Romanticism, but more to the function of sites or 
nodes on the Net itself.

There is no binarism in the work, no series of protocol statements. On
the other hand, virtuality is considered far beyond the ASCII text net-
scape that is most prevalent now, at the end of the twentieth century. 
The various issues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real or 
true-real VR are already in existence as embryonic, permitting the 
theorizing of various present and future spatialities and their inter-
connectedness.

The text often presents and stumbles over gender, genders and regenders
itself; consider other-gendered personages replacing the ones described. 
I have no stake in them beyond my own desire, memory, and circumlocu-
tion; others will do.

Although there are faux-texts of writers such as Dickinson, Stein, and
Poe, these texts are meant as partial transparencies. I do not mean to
imply that virtuality is synonymous with masquerade or freely-given 
choice of identities. Almost all other references are accurate, referen-
cing a wide range of writers and viewpoints. The resulting matrix, how-
ever, is entirely my own.

The Internet Text divides into fourteen files; there is also an index
file to the whole. While it is best read in the order it is written in,
certain early sections, at pains to establish a working vocabulary, are
more terse and perhaps difficult than others; they may be skipped, to be
returned to at a later date. The same goes for the few Qbasic programs  
and those sections which employ technical terminology (once again the 
gristle). (Note that the Text is continued in the alphabetic text, which 
contains files a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l, and m to date.)

Certain texts has been written with Kim Mcglynn or Angela Hunter, and are
of course as much their creation as my own. The work to date can be found
by telnetting to

Precipice


Negation gnaws at the Real; negation is a precipice. Whether or not it is
a present condition or the condition of an absence, or potential, it
fissures and splinters our possibility of anchoring on more than language.
It darkens as an operator passing as a state, a condition passing as a 
situation. It throws the jar into the void. It violates sanctity. The 
Torah is protected: Make a hedge around the Torah.

Cyberspace is not. Nouns slip like water, fracture themselves. The cor-
ruption of nouns reveals itself here. Things are always already splintered
and invisible. One never sees the same without the Other. The Other is its
negation. The negation is psychosis.

Inert


Is it possible to create a philosophical position form which it is imposs-
ible to move on? Not in the sense of time continuing, the relegation to
the historical, but in the sense of supercession. What epistemology would
remain rooted in an originary theory, or a theory that declares itself
originary? Would this not in fact parallel the development of conceptual
art towards that null point implied by Daniel Buren's continuous reduction
of painting to a series of prefabricated stripes?  (Which is a reduction
that projects _a_ null point, among others, projects in other words a
class of null points, of which it is a member.) Even a philosophy of the 
zero, however, is dependent upon null sets and other mathematico-logical 
considerations. 

Deconstruction still remains tethered to the present, but Russian nihilism
has been transformed forever into the historical... Logical atomism and
logical positivism, look at Carnap... Consider trigonometry as exhausted,
the comprehension of the gene; it's a matter of time in isolated domains. 
There is a broken continuum of scientific progress, at least in terms of
tolerance. One intercedes, in spite of issues of paradigm. Newton becomes
nothing more than crude limit. 

Philosophy wars against temporality. One desires statements constituting 
plateaus, potential wells, the obdurate. Even under erasure, the obdurate 
is not effacement; philosophy insists on the face. It harbors the other, 
the zero or null point; it deconstructs origins, allowing the residue to 
float to the top of time.

Time continues.

Presentation of the Self in Everyday Wryt


(I wryte my sex. I wrythe my sex.)

Earlier in the text I have been working on, I described negation as the
heart of human communication, the ability to be denied by the Other, and
the effacement that ensues. Ef-face-ment: the humiliation of the face and
its openness, the embarrassment which is caused by the sensation of the
denial of being. It is this risk that negation entails psychoanalytically,
a risk that is replaced in cyberspace by erasure: the ability to annihil-
ate words (but nothing else), through the use of kill/delete/and so forth,
the instantaneous cure of the pseudonymous other. 

Erasure parallels effacement, but permits the reading and wryting of the 
self; if I wryte net.sex with you, I _am_ net.sex; if I wryte violence 
among you, I _am_ violence. What I am wryting in both instances is with- 
out effacement, without risk; desire is doubly released here, first, as a 
flux or emission from the components of the id, and second, as a textual 
device which wrytes the unconscious, through the hysteria of (proto)lan- 
guage, reminiscent of, and replacing the real.

What is under erasure is always legible, readable; what is under efface-
ment, has turned the body away. The ability to annihilate textually
eliminates at best the framework of communication; the ability to efface
constructs shame. (On the Net, I am capable of flirting; in real life, I
am psychologically tongue-tied, unable to face the Other, even the mirror,
embarrassed, incapable of even asking someone for a date. But I am not ab-
sented in real life as I am on the Net where I open myself to the release-
ment of the Hidden.)

The "whining" effect of cybermind, the emphasis on pain, the occasional 
outpouring of emotion, is the result of erasure; at worst, an ignorant 
reply is the result. But the construct of the self through the mirroring 
of the Other that goes beyond language, into the implicit ontic processes 
of the gaze, is absent here; the self emerges more often in cybermind 
splayed, vulnerable of speech, and invulnerable of flesh. 

These are delicate distinctions, but they permit the speaking of pain
here, the therapuetics of the ascii unconscious as, through speaking, it
finds itself spoken-for, by others who are not. 

The reciprocity of languaging procures community. Never forget that Freud 
pursued the talking cure. (And crying and laughing, re: Plessner, are the 
limits of the body, limits which textually inscribe themselves in cyber- 
mind.)

	Pre Net.Sex 1990

	Flattened against the rim of your clitoris,
	its stem flowered within the teeth and lip
	of me and you, the mouth descends and showers
	between labia swollen with slow dark streams;
	and everything that was, or will be, is.
	Eyes press on liquid septum; they dip,
	enfold and drink, see night; your body's fevered
	hours are now my own. The mouth surrounds, the body
	dreams, inhales urethral showers, hot waves ascending
	from thigh to hip, flows between the breasts to neck,
	from tongue and back, salt eyes descending into
	tears. The anus burns, opens wide; a murdered speck
	returns into the light. There are no more of me,
	no more of you. There are none of the mountains.
	There are none. Where blood meets blood, nothing dies;
	clitoris swells, I breath it hard between the lids
	of sight. The mouth devours. Somewhere cries are lost
	against the skin. Everywhere is in.

Pre-Cybermind 1990

Without your presence, writing remains immaterial.
Something retains the course of this beyond the father?
Does the species repeat itself?
Does culture slide back into the phallus and its mimicry of strength?
Are questions repetitions, for example concerned with the sublimation of 
nurturing?
Women have been excluded from the question, problematize the 
interrogative. 
(But the question is asked _of_ the woman.)
To ask appropriates, crashing an entire structure.
Halves rebel against the absenting father.
At the very least exhaustion opens, fluctuates.
No one can complete the course set, no one of either gender.
 the insatiability of yearning and longing
Nostalgia and longing collapse desire into commodification.
The immateriality of writing seethes, inconsequential, invisible.
What I harbor is always elsewhere than the writing produced by harboring.
I am not responsible for myself! I repeat the same old story!
Speech adjudicates itself, adjusts, returns with fury, refuses to let go.
The occurrence of my writing: that nothing occurs in speech.
So writing is already machine production, autonomic.
So there is nothing of me present therefore the absence of the father.
Who writes itself into every discourse, transforming _him_ into neutrality.
Transforming him as far as allowable beneath the law of the father.
As if there were a mechanics of _jostling._
 inundation of pre-oedipal semiosis, part-objects, contour-processing?
Therefore a liquidity of logical fragments, infant seethings?
Which are never lost, moving to the limits of the body, laughter, tears.
To the excitation, shattering of the margins, contours.
Beyond the interrogative, remaining as the source/fragmentation of 
discourse.
Or the difficulty, impossibility, of opening up _same_ to _other_.
Writing as drift, without anchorage, untethered writing.
But nonetheless at odds with its subject (absented), choral, on the side 
of _whatever._
"Whatever" spoken accompanied by a gesture of resignation, particulate 
and abandoned field, "no matter what."
...
Writing incising the body, transforming fissure into inscription: lifted 
off the body, compartmentalized, the beginning of the (continuous) bi- 
furcation of the psychoanalytical field itself...
...
The abandoned field field of absence and loss field of memory and 
collapse field of decay and admonition...
...

Kim Il Sung wrote his mind literally across his country; @echo creates a
sourceless statement, unattributed, on MUDs and MOOs and talkers (one form
or another), as if the terrain itself has adapted to the position of the
author, everywhere, transcendent, no need to mention the name. Even the
menus in the restaurants of the capital were apparently written by him, as
were all the ideological statements. The stadium was named after him, and
you could see his cigarette butts in the museum. @echo also returns what-
ever is written, by virtue of the command, as if the earth were literally,
@Kim_Il_Sung, an interesting case of wryting, it seems to me, inscribing
without cyberspace, part of the ideological underpinnings of protolanguage
which aligns itself with the real, knows no bounds, and, in this case, is
awarded to the aggressor.

In Postmodern Sureno, a tape edited with Dawnja Burris, I worked with
issues of postmodernism in relation to Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. What
developed from this were considerations of geography in relation to tele-
communications, the maquiladora / colonia system, and the hallucinatory
city. The tape was shot on location, a series of interviews, landscapes,
commentaries, with little image manipulation. The journey was often in
real-time, Spanish and English, not all of it translated. 

Juarez appeared increasingly as an intensification, a gathering or coal-
escence of humans, part-objects, trails and traces, across a denuded land-
scape; there were no sewers, water, paved roads, or paid-for electricity. 
The last was "stolen" directly from overhead wires run into the dwellings,
and the water was trucked in to the lower elevations, from which it would
be hauled up the barren hills.

Television was everywhere, as were gangs and gang-signings, and the area
was largely undefined, undemarcated, the number of inhabitants of Juarez
at that point (say three years ago) unknown, the delineation of the formal
urban geography equally problematic. News spread by foot, by television 
and radio, through signs and loudspeakers. 

The colonia dwellings were examples of bricolage, paralleled everywhere in
the world from Brasilia to the Philippines. They were remarkably invent-
ive, territorial demarcations which might or might not shift. Some of them
were in existence for years. The colonias had loose identities.  The city
maps, which were very few at the time, did not map the city, only the more
or less disrupted core. 

Sickness was a catastrophe about to happen, with the factories dumping
industrial waste, combined with human, directly into either runoff chan-
nels or cesspools. The maquiladoras themselves, some of them, provided
education and health-care. The city was centered around a plaza, where
traditional dances were carried out, for money, overlooked by a cathedral. 
Juarez had schools and health-care towards the center of town, which was 
extremely run down, not servicing the outskirts to any extent.

Microwave connected Juarez with El Paso, as did television, beamed from
Mexico, from New Mexico, from Texas. This was also the region of classic
border radio, from Wolfman Jack further south and east, all the way to
Tiajuana. Mexico is now wiring heavily for the Internet, and nations
everywhere are backing down from their borders into coagulations of inter-
ests, difficult and relative nomadicisms in which whole populations are on
the move, some of which are making Mexico City the most populous in the
world. 

Postmodern Sureno dealt with all of these issues, as well as the informal
economies described by de Soto in The Other Path. These economies, their
redrawings of territories and the territorial concept itself, are increas-
ingly becoming a planetary consciousness, one already presaged from the 
Internet. That consciousness is fragmented, not only by languages, histor- 
ies, populations, and identifications, but also by tourisms, scarcities, 
linguistic hegemonies, and electronic communications. All of these play 
into the world as a whole becoming, like the MOO with @dig commands, an 
accumulation of local exchanges within corrupted and distant superstruc- 
tures. Brother Gates may rule the wires, and his subjects will never have 
heard of him.

And his subjects may starve.

  So I go on, heeding Jane's advice. I have not performed violence on a
human being since hurtin gthe two boys in Bayreuth. I try to appreciate
beauty. Most of the time I'm equal to the task, but sometimes my head
turns to wild flights of fantasy, envisioning other electric calms and
moral stands that might bring me permanent salvation. When I think of
these things, my reason and love of beauty desert me and I hang suspended
like a bizarre hovercraft in a holding pattern over Los Angeles. But I
hold. 
  I listen to a lot of music.

Disconnections


One can construct postmodern sociologies, based on cities like Juarez,
counties like those found in southwest Texas, anywhere that displaced pop-
ulations exist and increase without the accompanying urban infrastuctures
we take for granted. These regions participate in "communication econom-
ies," since they possess a wide variety of channels for public and pri-
vate, one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, communications. 
Private one-to-one, on the order of the telephone or cb, intensify ties
at a distance, either from rural origins (diachrony), or city-wide empha-
sizing origins (synchrony) - or productive of other identities and econo-
mies, such as beeper networks for drugs. Many-to-one occurs in the form of
flyers, distributed individually to homes; one-to-many is the domain of
the loudspeaker, among other things. All of these forms of communication 
can create closer ties and more tightly constructed identities than 
regionalisms or nationalisms, often overlaid from above (see, still, Jean 
Duvignaud, Change at Shebika). 

Of all these forms, radio and television are the most critical and easiest
to import/export; telephones were very rare in the colonias, but televi-
sion and vcrs were not. One of the shacks in the colonia we visited at
length was a video rental store. In the markets, rap and other musics were
common; there were huge quantities of cassettes for sale, both (apparen-
tly) bootleg and legitimate. 

Boundaries break down in situations like these and the political becomes 
the psychoanalytical, and vice versa. The distinction between urban and 
rural for example is transformed into a matter of style mapped on to 
competing images produced in both regions (you see the same thing in rep- 
resentations of so-called "hillbillies," from L'il Abner to Deliverance). 
The images are often introjected, so that, for example, part of the 
image/imaginary of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) is Hollywood- 
produced and then reintegrated into Canadian Culture (see Pierre Berton). 
(And see The Harder They Come, and any other number of movies.)

All of this is compounded by tourisms which reinscribe cities and encap-
sulate cultural domains; the commodification, for example, of native
crafts results in an emphasis within the native community to produce those
"traditions" which apparently sell. (There have been extensive studies on
Native American crafts production in this regard.)

These tourisms are another form of communicative linking, nomadic, comp- 
licated, displacing the native populations in the region.

The Internet, still in its early stages, fits well within these models,
which are hardly models at all, but flows upon fixed and denuded topogra-
phies, as well as economies rapidly running out of resources of all sorts,
from food to bandwidth. I should add that Juarez and the southwest coun-
ties are only openly systematic of what, for example, may be found in my
own neighborhood or elsewhere in North America - everywhere, in fact, as
fundamental realignments are occurring among and in the midst of nations. 
The relatively minor battles fought _here_ will be on the streets within a
couple of decades: One can imagine, again, a future combining enclaves of 
the rich with the deterritorializations of everyone else - including de- 
territorializations of the body and the "I" itself. Fascisms are an easy 
way out.

The Human War on Time Which is Human


came home. It wasn't as if things were in ruins; things were numbers 
still. She looked around; the @-commands remained in place. It wasn't
as if there were verbs.

thought verbs there weren't. The war on the present; things were never
_there._ Impingement of spines, spicules. The present was enervating.
She crawled.

home. Not memories but layouts of construction. Indirect addressing. 
She was sure of human war. Word after word of time, crawling across time,
crawling across the tumor.

came thought. Into the home; exits and entrances, @-constructions. There
was never time and never time enough. That the movement marched upon
itself, folds and indiscretions. Prehensile, as if there were were.

never was home. She. That would have been a relation. That would have 
been a gap or a witness. Inconceivable lamina. The war on the present,
uncanny war that never was. Impingement of the human.
