[Chorus: Joe]
They say this is a big rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal baby, I gotta make it

[50 Cent]
I never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twists and turns
Bumps and bruises, I live, I learn
I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
It's hard to get a start in these parts without paper
Homie I grew up in hell, a block away from heaven
That corner e'ry 15 minutes, it move a seven
Pure snow, bag it then watch it go
Occupational options, get some blow or some hoes
Shoot the ball or the strap, learn to rap or to jack
Fuck it man, in the meantime go 'head and pump a pack
This my regal royal flow, my James Bond bounce
That +007+, that's 62 on my count
I'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers
Look a bitch in the eyes, and tell her "Baby I love it"
You're my inspiration, you're my motivation
You're the reason that I'm movin with no hesitation (yeah)

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[50 Cent]
I gotta hustle through the hustle and bust while I make a move
Manuever around the rats and wolves, I'm from the school
of hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop
Graveyard, pick a block, cause niggaz want your spots
I'm tryin to stack shit, then I go legit
Hollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggaz trip
My cocaine endeavors, give me corporate ties
I'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds
All I got is my word, balls and my instinct
I'm tryin to make it, we already made it my friends think
We already on top, I got a bigger plan
No more controlled substances or hand-to-hand
White collar visions, game-changin mission
Big wrists, big wins equal bigger livin
Perfect position, watch me transition
From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky

[Chorus] w/ ad libs
