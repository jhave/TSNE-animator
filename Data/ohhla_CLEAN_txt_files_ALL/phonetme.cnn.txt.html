[Noreaga], {Capone}
Son I zone, my gun is never on safety
I copped the new Jordan's, the white ones wit skate key
	{Me, I'm just chillin Pop, serving my time
	Got my greens on, these faggots ain't deservin a shine}
And yeah, while I'm home you like livin abroad
I heard those crackers dissed you, smack you at the board
	{When twenty-four, they did the same to Norman and Lord
	Heard you cop the silver GS, my nigga you scored}
Yea, it's nuthin, cause I'm gettin bread
Crack is dead, bitches wanna give me head
	{You's a funny nigga, I just saw Kai in the yard
	He said holla, when you getta chance, scribe the God
Tell Kai I said what up, and his sister is grown
I copped the four-fifth auto, it's pretty with chrome
	{The day I come home, I need a mink and a brand new Mac
	A few jump offs, some Dom's, some beer, and the crack}

I'm outside on the streets, just holdin it down
	{I'm in jail pumpin iron son, and readin books}
I'm in the studio, droppin sixteen's wit hooks
	{I'm in the yard in the cypha, just smokin my sticks}
I'm in Queens Coliseum, just coppin new kicks
	{I hit the law library, hope to come home soon}
I just finished up the album, fin' ta drop in June
	{Yeah, yeah, yeah}

	{My little dun gangstas, caught in blood beef with the Kings
	 You know Jarome brotha, my dun I used to creep wit in Queens}
And dat's my dun too, so I'ma find out now
And have my dogs on the Island, just get on the prawl
	{On the other side of things, I'm tryin to get released
	around my born day, but a nigga keep in beef wit da beast}
Fuck the police, cause all of dem niggas is fake
Don't lose your C.R., son you'll get your open date
	{Dun, I'ma see ya regardless, 
	cause I got two violent felony charges}
And you know your appeal is progress
	{You're my dog, dun}
And we gon keep this tight
I keep your commisary phat, I'ma keep you right
	{I got the chronic stashed in a coffee carton and kicks
	 Good lookin for the bitches butt-naked and the flicks}
And you ain't gotta thank me, real niggas do real things
I keep freak hoes, they really do ill things
	 
I'm outside on the streets, just holdin it down
	{I'm in jail pumpin iron son, and readin books}
I'm in the studio, droppin sixteen's wit hooks
	{I'm in the yard in the cypha, just smokin my sticks}
I'm in Queens Coliseum, just coppin new kicks
	{I hit the law library, hope to come home soon}
I just finished up the album, fin' ta drop in June
	{Yeah, yeah, yeah}

I used to be ugly, now these bitches is Medusa
And guess what? I made you executive producer
Some extra G's, so when you come home you breathe
	{They won't believe to see me come home to a V
	 Pigs pressin me, want autographs for they seeds
	 I gotta C.O. thinkin that we gon fuck when I leave}
Yo nigga think about this money, fuck them hoes
We gonna throw a pounda weed out, at one the shows
Spread it out, in the crowd, see them niggas get wild
Capone home, niggas still diggin our style
	{Shit is foul, how these crackers tryin to keep me confined?
	I gotta visit last week and saw Gremlin Divine}
Meet Timbo and Ice, got bent and rolled dice
Scooped, ridin loose, then we headed to Post 
And got some hydro-weed and we had our toast
	{Son there's only one minute left
	 Son there's only one minute left, son I'm ghost}

I'm outside on the streets, just holdin it down
	{I'm in jail pumpin iron son, and readin books}
I'm in the studio, droppin sixteen's wit hooks
	{I'm in the yard in the cypha, just smokin my sticks}
I'm in Queens Coliseum, just coppin new kicks
	{I hit the law library, hope to come home soon}
I just finished up the album, fin' ta drop in June
	{Yeah, yeah, yeah}

I'm outside on the streets, just holdin it down
