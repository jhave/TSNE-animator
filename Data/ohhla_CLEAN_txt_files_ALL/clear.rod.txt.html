[Chorus: John Lennon sample]
Oh my love, for the first time in my life
My eyes are wide open
Oh my lover, for the first time in my life
My eyes can see
I see the wind, oh, I see the trees
Everything is clear in my heart
I see the clouds, oh, I see the sky
Everything is clear in our world

[Cno Evil]
I see the wind, I see the trees, I see the clouds, I see the sky
As they came in, I can't believe, I had my doubts, I wonder why
My eyes are wide open, writing a poem, this beat is soothing
I adopted a new saying for my life (let's keep it moving)
Feel the sorrow, feel the dreams, feel the life, feel the love
Everything is clear in my heart, my world and up above
It all fits like a glove now, and for the first time in my life
I can relax and sit back and say (it's alright)
Nothing realer than these words from John Lennon up in heaven
Make you realize, it all can end from a single weapon
It's tragic, how life is so elastic like plastic
Can burn and blasted, and disappear like magic
It's madness, how tear drops is the result of being sad
Fall like rain on an Autumn day, dripping down the glass
But now I spring into action, no more cold winter days
Imagine all the summer fashion, getting hit by water waves
As I turn the next page, I can't help but think of the past
The future's too hard to predict, so don't take it so fast
Today is a gift, that's why it's called the present
Now in harmony with myself, I feel so pleasant
So do you see what I see, and do you know what I know
And have you surpassed all the evil, and can live like Cno
I sure do hope so, cuz it's a state of grace, a true blessing
Lay up in my place and learn a brand new lesson
It's beautiful, how my words flow, and the beat goes
All in one rhythm, while you listening to the R-O
D-E, N-T-Z, Rodentity
Everything is clear now, so, go ahead and see
Just feel my visions, no more collisions
On a mission with addition, no more division
No more subtracting, we love rapping
We have fun when we do it, man, we smiling, we laughing

[Chorus]

[Li-Mouse]
Living in a society, fueled by your status
Trying to get all your eyes, just to look at us
But really all I'm surrounded is by actors
People ain't looking here just because of my stature
People say stop, racism is gone
Well then, put this black skin on
And tell me if everything you do is just plain fair
Or if you get stares like you don't even belong there
Yeah, they all joke around and that's just fine
But do you really understand what goes on in my grind?
You had a back-up, everything was paid in full
And if you wanna debate that, don't wanna hear that bull
Shit, won't let go, I got the grip
I rest in my casket, still holding on to it
And most of ya'll chicks are just plain ol' airheads
Sweet as the candy, but logic remains dead
No I'm not sexist, waiting to be proved otherwise
It's been years since tears rolled out these eyes
A heart turn cold on the edge of a full demise
But still, ain't nobody listening to my cries
They say if you help at first, you get good at times
I've helped for so long, but I ain't get mines
So, I rest my heart and soul on the hands of the Gods
Four slices, lay on freshly groomed sides
Praying to them, that they help me through the struggle
And find my way through this light mess called rubble
Father says to purge anger out of your heart
And so, this is how I'mma start the deadly art
I see the wind and, I see the trees
Everything is just so clear, I can just breathe
I see the clouds, and I can see the sky
Wish I could take up a form of a falcon and just fly

[Chorus to fade] </pre>
