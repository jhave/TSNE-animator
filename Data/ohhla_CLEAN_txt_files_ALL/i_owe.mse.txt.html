[Intro]
Uh, uh, come on
Yeah, yeah, Come on
Yeah, here we go

[Verse 1: Ma$e]
They tried to imbed it in my brain, and said it never change
Even when they need the anthem, they gon' say the name
With the bentley or the phantom, you ain't said a thing man
It ain't wordy, plus it ain't dirty
Full time, Millionare, and ain't thirty
Anything out there, smooth and basic
Tennin' up, came from the school of mason
You know what's up, even my Jews await this
You would be a fool to hate this
I came from a school of atheists, and still the same flow
Wrist looking like a rainbow, and I know
It's better now, when you get rich, you wanna settle down
Full speed ahead, we on the pedal now
When it came man, you know I was never around
When the harm came, you know I was never found
But if I go, as you call, I can let 'em down

[Chorus 2x]
I know, I don't really do the weed, in high dro
I don't really do the freaks, as I hold
I know, I owe

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
I wanna coach like new rap, pull out the plays
Like X's and O's, Crow 2's, protech my flows
I deal with ice and furs like eskimos
Ya'll seen me high, ya'll seen me low
Ya'll seen me fly, and ya'll seen me broke
Ya'll heard the beat, but I brought the flow
I seen the goal, when nobody wanna know
You married now, what'chu mean, ooh ma ma
Really in mind I'm like, ooh nah nah
I got Millions, watchin' I can't go left
Cause if I do, then they go deaf
You know your man Tyson ain't been the same since indiana
And Kobe ain't been the same, since colorado
Aaliyah, Left Eye, they brought lots of sorrow
Me Myself I'm a hard act to follow
I know you think I'm gonna stop tommorrow, uhh

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3: Ma$e]
Change the scenery, ya'll ain't seen the enemy
No dro and hennessy, I don't need the energy
Save this energy, fo real the entity
Back in the industry, just to let the sinners see
Meaning me, and they treat me like the enemy
Yes ya'll remember me, but now it's like ten of me
They cloned me, it's like everybody owned me
Cuda tried to phone me, but God already warned me
Feel alone, I feel like the only
All eyes on him, to tell me why they on me
I gotta eat, I gotta live, I gotta ride
I gotta teach, I gotta preach, I gotta tithe
So I need my money, right, right now
The realest thing in the world is in my life right now
I had to switch it up, kick it up, like, like, like now
I get the word, I put this mic right now, you write that down

[Chorus 3x]</pre>
