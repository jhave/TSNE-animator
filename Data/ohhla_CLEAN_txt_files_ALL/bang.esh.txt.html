([Esham] and {priest} at Confession booth)    {Who's there?}
[Forgive me father for I have sinned.]
{Yes my son, you have a confession to make?}
[They want me to do it again.]
{Those who repent shall recieve salvation.}
[I gotta go back.]

[Esham]
I bang on everything, boy

[Chorus]
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
Up jump the boogie
And you're just a rookie
So I take your cookies, boy
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
I'm getting money, I push the seven-sixty
Got green like Bill Bixby, baby
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
No, you shouldn'ta missed me
Cause I'm gonna toss 'em back at ya, like hot frisbees, fucker
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
It's all I know, it's all I do
Countin cash in stacks, grind all night through

[Esham]
I'm push the package in this bitch, I got a automatic
I ran down your block and popped a crack addict
Speakin' in tounges since I was young; I tote a uzi
Professional hitman, pop you and your floozie
Who's he? Esham, I do no interviews
Blood's on my tennis shoes, win or lose
I'm finna smoke a ounce of kush, fuck George Bush
Still on the block where it's ho,t murders be overlooked
Dreams and nightmares, everythings right there
In the city that don't care, somehow we profit off welfare
Hell yeah!! Pistols be poppin, coppers is droppin
No time for no bitches, keep my riches less it's coke shoppin'

[Esham]
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
No, you don't know me
I roll with my homie
It's Jesus, not unholy, ya heard me?
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
I send hollows threw you , I scream "Hallelujah"
I do ya, cause you don't know me baby
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
This is for my Crips and my Bloods
And all my gangstas and thugs that show slug love
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
Guns up in the club, holding a lot of drugs
Whats really good, what?

[Esham]
Power and paper stacked up like skyscrapers
I'm getting my money right, I'm keeping my game tight
Oh no! I'm comin up on a bubble, bitches in trouble
Breakin boulders like Barney Rubble, makin' my pockets double
Slug from a fourty-five, I live and die
Like the gangstas before me til they fourty-four me
Or outlaw me, they never saw no one raw as me
The general in this war is me
Hitler young wigspliter
Kill any rapper out there, nuclear warfare
Spit napalm, Esham, wicket like Taliban
Push a Denali from Detroit to Cali, mon
Wicket!, Wicket! Wicket!, It's so wicket!
Wicket! The way I kick shit

[Chorus]
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
I'm poppin' pistols
So duck if the bullets whistle
You're hopin that they don't hit you, homie
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
I'm down to buck'em all, fuck'em all
Till they bodys in the ground where the maggots crawl
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
This is not a game
Say "hello" to my little friend.. Bang Bang Bang
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
Blow out your brains
Ain't no friends in this game
Fuck a 5-0 and the fame

[Esham]
Prelude to all this evil
Some people might say it's money whether they believe you
Judgement day is still a'comin people, never leave me
It will be with me forever only time I need you
When your fuckin head is severed stackin'up my green books
At night I'm playin' with black magic, tell me, have you seen crooks
Busting off they automatics deep into the darkness?
Some might even say I'm heartless
Even if the cops is around, I'll bang your ass regardless</pre>
