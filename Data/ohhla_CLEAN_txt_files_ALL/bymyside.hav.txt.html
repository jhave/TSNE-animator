[40 Glocc]
I move on my instincts and practice by what I preach
A bullet'll make you think, I'm fuller then Hennessey
When I pull it, I pop it off, popping all at your car
Smashing off in the dark, through traffic I'm what you call
A gangsta that break them laws, a gangsta that keep it all
Hood out in public, sagging, showing my drawers
When my pistol by my pelvis, this ain't just another song
It's a muthafucking anthem
I got my hand up on my balls, smoking on a cancer
Fucking up my lungs, hitting niggas up like where the fuck you from
Acting like you strapped, nigga, where the fucking gun
Niggas quick to make a scene, the scene when the cops come
So you hit 'em with that beam to the spleen and blood you lost
Leave 'em sleeping on the street, choking on his own blood
Just coating this no love, this fucking thing know what's up
Respect is when you see us, so them choppers'll wet you up

[Chorus 2x: 40 Glocc]
Dipping on low bros and traffic in slow mo'
Just me and my pistol, I keep a she under clothes
I love it just like my kids, treat her just like my bitch
Need her, she keep a clip, I'm anxious to see her spit

[Havoc]
I get it, how I can get it, but never selling my soul
Can get it, how I wanna get it, I come the pistol
Keep her with me, she needy, don't wanna be left alone
What's the sense to leave her home, fuck around, I'm a danger
She concealed til a nigga show his ass, I reveal her
Have you looking down the barrel, like you looking in the mirror
Have you lying face down, but you hear me little clearer
Got a little bad news, and guess who the bearer?
It's her, that bitch, that chrome four fifth
Your wrist looking blue, I'm on that brisk
You next in line, you on that list
Put that pistol in your mouth, give her a big fat kiss
When I'm anxious, and dangerous, to be around here
This here, Eddie Grier, muthafucka, I'm near
With that shiny bitch, that grimy bitch
And best believe, yo, she ain't no model bitch

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
