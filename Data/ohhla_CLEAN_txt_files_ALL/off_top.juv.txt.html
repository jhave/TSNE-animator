[Juvenile]
Wodie we get down but to a certain extent
All that cha shoin' with them hoes be gettin my name bent
I'm showin' you love but I love my money even mo
Disrespect me or play me off the top you gotta go
My people played me, we ain't getting down no more
Look that aint how its 'posed to be but thats the way its gone go
I aint with that front shit
That playin' with gun shit
That fuckin' with niggas who think they run shit
All that tongue shit
When my gun click, niggas silencing down
You was hollin' like a motherfucker bitch holla at me now
Peep, what made a nigga wanna go and mess with me bone
And he gettin' on my nerves, I'm bout to go in his home
Bitch my brother aint no hoe
Bitch my mother aint no hoe
Bitch my father aint no hoe
Why you try ta play me like a hoe
Shit, I might as well just go head on and bust his head
Cuz them people gone give me the charge anyway 
If he come up dead
Now tell'em bout that beemer I got
Tell'em bout that new home I got
Tell'em bout that Cutlass on chrome I got
You ta show ya shit 
Thats why you showed you was a bitch
Now you runnin with yo melon cuz you know you gone get it split

[Baby]
Niggas ridin' impala's with them rattler stripes
Passin' hollin at hoes with the fuck finger sayin fuck'em black
I'm stackin' Gs movin keys thats my life black
Niggas orderin' vests
Just ta protect they chests
And duckin' these niggas tryin ta use they smith-n-wessons
Playboy, I'm ridin' in suburbans
To Land Rovers to Range Rovers, niggas with automatics
Niggas ridin' big bodies I done did that
I'm ridin' jags drop top and I can do that
I'm lettin' these hoes hair blow if they got that
I don't fuck with bald head hoes I aint with that
I talk shit and I got the cream and the jewels to do that
I walk it like I talk playboy you can believe that
The new ice, yellow diamonds and I'm loving that
Blue diamonds Big Tymin and I'm with that
I done made more money independent than a major nigga went gold
I put that on my soul and my gold
And my 20 inch rims on my Range Rover with TVs
And I'm lovin' these hoes I flip mo keys 
than a acrobat ten nigga you can believe that
Me and my brother go rock for rock
Walk block for block
And if we got beef with a nigga we'll go glock for glock
No mo sellin' keys on the d.l.
I wanna holla at v.l.
Lets say rest in peace to L and T nigga

[Manny Fresh]
I live my life on full
Unzip my pants and I pull 
A big dick baby
You look sick maybe
You can use a nigga that'll hold ya hand
I tell ya what ya suck my dick I'll be your man
Now here it is diamonds for the bithces that I fuck
Not , I get the pussy make like donald and duck
To the next project scattered site or crib
Slangin' dick where you live
I don't really give, a precious second of my pimp playa time
You can taste the kool-aid but don't drink the wine
Holy Roley diamond bezel, 20 inch whezel
98 cromed out gangsta grizeal
Take one of my bitches and I'm fuckin
Sistas anties grandmas and cousins
Mommas baby mommas family members and all that shit
If the bitch need guidance them I'm her pimp

[Manny Fresh]
