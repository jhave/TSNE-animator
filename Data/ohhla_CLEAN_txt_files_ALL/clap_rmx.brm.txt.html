[Busta Rhymes]
Back with the remix with Spliff and Sean-A-Paul on the corner
Can't believe when we do it we smack it down how we wanna
Keepin it comin keepin it goin cause we ain't playin
I'm talkin to all my people cause what I'm sayin is

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
In case you ain't know and in case you ain't heard
And if you want us to set it just give me the word
This one goes out to my soldiers that be flippin them birds
To all my shorties wigglin they shakin they curves

[Sean Paul]
We make it clap, we make it clap, we make it clap, we make it clap

[Verse 2: Spliff Star]
Poor snapper, lookin at shorty shakin it and makin it clap
Booty big pokin out like twenties on the lap
When I give it to her shorty know how to throw it back
Booty bangin to the beat sometimes we overlap-sing
Gal peel out your blouse and your tight-jeans
Let me lick you down dip you with some ice-cream
Gal holla holla my name when I slide-in
Thunderstorm, rain, sleet and light-ning
Hold me tight feel the triniman grin-ding and grin-ding and grin-ding
Gal dip and bounce start whin-ning
You see Spliff, Sean Paul and Busta Rhymes, seen
(Busta Rhymes: We got dough) You could tell by what we dri-ving
(Busta Rhymes: Lookin to chose) How it's different and blin-ding
And blin-ding and blin-ding it's like that make it clap now

[Chorus]

[Sean Paul]
We make it clap, we make it clap, we make it clap, we make it clap

[Bridge: Sean Paul]
Flipmode a roll wid all di hottest set a gal dem inna di dance
And Dutty Cup we deyah mek di gal dem jump up and prance
Busta Rhymes and Sean-A-Paul di lyrical magician
There fi mek dem switch and jump up wave up dem hands
Flipmode a roll wid all di hottest set a gal dem inna di dance
And Dutty Cup we deyah mek di gal dem jump up and prance
Busta Rhymes and Sean-A-Paul di lyrical magician
There fi mek dem switch and jump up wave up dem hands

[Verse 3: Sean Paul]
We make it clap deh, keep it a clap gal wiggle yuh body

Listen di lyrics a weh mi dun mi all a chat seh
Rotate yuh body then non stop like apache

Inna di videolight just like a big sunday matinee
Nuff fi gimme di light mi blow di smoke like apache
Mashin up di dance and mi flatten it, we make it clap

[Busta Rhymes]
Who a call me the abominal snowman
Put it down make 'em say it's such a phenominal show man
Unbelievable how you be stackin the dough man
When we rollin a thousand headcracks in a row man
The way we start the show and how we constantly flow man
Regular paper comin watch me properly blow man
Come on keepin it comin keepin it goin cause we ain't playin
I'm talkin to all of my people because what I'm sayin is

[Chorus]

[Sean Paul]
We make it clap, we make it clap, we make it clap, we make it clap

[Outro: Sean Paul]
We make it clap, we make it clap, we make it clap, we make it clap</pre>
