Got something to tell you girl...
Been on my mind all day...
Running through it...
Nesty...
Talk 2 em...

Girl its enough with games
I know you want the same (yeah)
Better sex is in the rain
Give it til you feel the pain (pain)
I know you feelin strange (strange)
Twisted and feelin insane (sane)
Got you grabbin and scratching my back
Make you srceam my name (name)
Pullin and grippin sheets (sheets)
bite pillows with yo teeth (teeth)
Lick you from head to feet (feet)
Girl were both some freaks
We got it started ma (yeah)
Picture how far we gone
Make you say "o" louder den Omarion

O...thats gonna be the sound
Girl when its goin down
Your body sayin O
Dont have to say my name
Girl Im just glad you came
So you can say O
In the morning O
In the night
You sayin O
Means I was in it right O...
You can't be mad at me
I'm just aiming to please
Let me hear you scream O...

Girl come over and
Let's get this thing crackin'
You'll be surprised when
You see what O's unpackin'
Cause I'm young but I'm ready
Try'na get hot and heavy
Tell you what if you let me
Yeah, yeah
Girl I'm gone take you
Somewhere that never been
Show you some things that
Make you wanna show your friends
Have you so weak that you
Can't even say a thing
But that's okay all you gotta say

[Chorus]
Ooohh thats gonna be the sound
Girl when its goin down
Your body sayin Oohh
Dont have to say my name
Girl Im just glad you came
So you can say Oohh
In the morning Ohh

You sayin Ohh
Means I was in it right Ohhhh
You can't be mad at me

Let me hear you scream Ohhhh

O is for that overtime Im puttin in
Well go for hours take a break
And go at in again
Girl I work my way from A
All the way to Z
But trust me baby girl
O is where you wanna be
Couldn't believe me when I tell you
I'm not trynna tell you what to do
Cause when it's said and done
The choice ain't mine it's really up to you
Just say yes don't fix your mouth
To tell me no drop the bottom
Jaw for me and just say Oooooooohhhhhhhhhhh

[Chorus]
O...thats gonna be the sound
Girl when its goin down
Your body sayin Oohhh
