[Aesop Rock]
Deliver us from evil
Litter bugged amoeba simmer on the brimstone 
Grim tone, bring him home
Authoritative restoration will be rationed righteously 
to those deemed suitably fit to police their own sobriety 
Standard law that wriggle intimate, mingle with coincidental mishap, then snap 
Curse the digs 
Yellow brick Zooka birthed the piss 
I trust that every litigant will be his own worst pig
Thirst big, baby, I reckon y'all are a mess too, but insecurities will 
make your bio sound less cool
If fizzy lifting drinks are par for saddling your horse, 
you might consider sawing Sea Biscuit off at the knees before
Few chew sacred like them sewer cougars
patient 'til the Lugar movers daytrip with them super cookers blazing 
Divvy up the remarkable carcass, what a relief
And y'all ain't even washed yesterday's blood off your teeth 
Behind the buck-bin Duane Reade aviators plated with the dookie brown tint sit 
the googly off the daily paper 
Clip red or blue (Blue!)
Either way the shredder chew 
Letter to the editor messenger, let him through

Engine engine number nine, sock it to me one more time 
Said uh, un-gowa, we got the power (Repeat 3x)
Automatic systematic engine number nine, sock it to me one more time 
Said un-gowa we got the power 
Okay, do your thing (*Echoes*)
Family, do your thing, do your thing, stop

[Aesop Rock]
I put a beetle on his back and take notes 
Play a dealt hand. Kicks wing tips 'til the tank flips conveyor belt 
Shelf a mayor saber for catering navy savior
help who treat stray children like clay pigeons off the sailor's deck 
He squeaks 'pull', I freak the wool over the owl eye;
filter sheepish winter through its sister on the outside
Meanwhile back at HQ, he's twisting his moustache, hatching a plan to hate you 
Shark fin dollar pay a ghost guild buckets 
Hard pill to swallow and he knows pills, trust him 
Drunkards of the crystal palace suck assignment
walk the diamonds in the soles of your chukkas back to the slaves who mined 'em 
It's Raggedy Andy clan; fancy the pretty stitches 
'til he learned the skinny on the fragility's physics 
Like he snag a button eye on the fly by the barbs 
Super glue the parts, now his students are alarmed 
No worries, it's snow flurries compared to what the sheriff wish:
curfew the city that must not
Bust warn shots at a run-of-mill Waldo on a doctor hunt
he will make the most wonderful sarcophagus occupant

Engine engine number nine, sock it to me one more time 
Said uh, un-gowa, we got the power (Repeat 3x)
Automatic systematic engine number nine, sock it to me one more time 
Said un-gowa we got the power 
Okay, do your thing (*Echoes*)
Family, do your thing, do your thing, stop

[Aesop Rock]
Rotten egg, not to be pegged as fashionably tardy 
The difference is the latter got the freebies from the barkeep
Wait, Aes-fucking-Rock is in the building
The room looked up, looked down, kept sniffing 
Slit the neck and slip the chip in, sipping anti-governmental zombie grog
but zombied up gladly on your Swiss Army watch 
As if twitching upon your authored condition's
really that different from administered conditioning glitches 
Kissing a firewater pitcher with the fatal Drano-chase game
It's hiding in the Nang labeled with the day-glow face paint 
Some buckle when the T-Rex treks shakes the puddles
My huggable jungle 
My son of a dove cry, humble, even doves die
I took the black outta something to judge the lung by 
I took the mag out like the crack out of a bum's pipe 
I hook the tag up like a flag over the plum sky 
Mud pie cruiser with an oink for the innocent
I blame it on the ambiguous quote unquote system
If a quota needs some filling you're a whore
Sincerely yours, engine number nine conductor 
All aboard!!

Engine engine number nine, sock it to me one more time 
Said uh, un-gowa, we got the power (Repeat 3x)
Automatic systematic engine number nine, sock it to me one more time 
Said un-gowa we got the power 
Okay, do your thing (*Echoes*)
Family, do your thing, do your thing, stop</pre>
