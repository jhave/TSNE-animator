(Verse 1, Eighball)
I make the money, money don't make me
South-side, til' I die, poetry, Ol' G
Lookin' good, in my big black S-U-V
Fat boy wit' the brains, be wit' MJG
Full of sticky green, I'm a fiend for the 'Dro
Got dough, young pimpin', just a slow flow pro
Lean in the paint, on my old school beamin'
Pop the trunk quick nigga, gimme one reason
Ice on my wrist, got my ho arm freezin'
My neck stay froze, it don't matter what the season
Eightball, fat boy, call it how ya see it
Pimp, gutter, young nigga, in a quarter-million dollar whip

(Verse 2, MJG)
Rollin' through the city wit' the top let back, I
Hit the trunk button, make it pop like that, I'm
M-J fuckin' G, I'm not a coward or a snitch, it's
Too many niggas out here illegitamite
I'm ridin' and I'm leanin', get my swerve on good
But I'm, seein' more haters than a third eye could
It's a must, I be keepin' the 4-5 right here, why?
It's the only thing that you boys might fear
Baby girl, how do you really make it shake like that?
How can, you be so thick, and have a waste like that?
It's important to keep it so gritty-gritty, I know
You can, smile in my face and then steal my dough
But I'm

(Verse 3, Bun B)
I'm in a big-body slab, wit' the rear chopped off (Off)
Sittin' on butter leather, that's tear-drop soft (Soft)
Interior stitched and tucked, like ya grandmas quilt
And my cup of syrup ain't half empty, it's half filled
Gotta Cigarillo full of that lavender 'Dro ('Dro)
Everyday's a holiday, on my calendar, ho (Ho)
Put the ice around my neck, and I start up the light show
And proceed to takin' over, you cut with the white snow
This one here is for my ballers and my true street thugs
My real trap-or-die niggas, movin' street drugs
Keep ya grip on ya motherfuckin' strap on tight
So soon as you see a hater, you can clap on site
It's the king of the trill, and the underground too
Step in the ring bitch, you won't make it to round two
Eightball, lil' JG, and U-G-K
Showin' ya how to ride and swerve, the true G way
We comin' down

(Hook, Slim Thug)
Ridin' and swervin'
