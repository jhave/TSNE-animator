Intro: from the O'Jays "Darlin' Darlin' Baby" by (K. Gamble, L. Huff)

You're my darlin' darlin' baby
You're my darlin' darlin' love
You're my darlin' darlin' baby
I said you're everything, I ever hoped for
in a woman..
And as long, as I may live.. ooh, you're {*record cuts off*}

[Big Punisher]
Yo
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
Jump on top of my dick and work them hips, until I bust a shot
It doesn't stop, I'm only beginnin I'm bonin your women
While you home all alone, I'm blowin up in em
Sendin them back to you, mad at you
Don't catch a motherfuckin attitude
I'm just showin you how this rapper do
Capital Punishment, when I'm up in it, suckin it
Bustin it out, nice blouse, let me unbutton it
You're fuckin wit King Papi Chulo when knockin culo
Pop your mulos out the socket tryin to ride with the sumo
You know my rise is high, word I be drillin em
Bitches be tryin to ride but the current be killin em
Fillin em with the cash, my cheese premium unleaded
Come get it, first wreck the ton, then let the Pun hit it
Split it in half, watch the gas, baby take a bath
Be good, I might put away the wood and give you the mustache

Chorus: Big Punisher and the O'Jays

"You're my darlin' darlin' baby.."
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
"You're my darlin' darlin' love.."
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
"You're my darlin' darlin' baby.."
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
"You're my darlin' darlin' love.."
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot

[Big Punisher]
I bang a stranger in my torture chamber, feed the locas tocha pinga
while I force my finger where my bollas linger
I bring the pain like Method, when I flex and flip the coochie
Puerto Rican to the core, but no Boriquas eat the pussy
'Scuse me for bein blunt, but I've been eatin cunts
since pimps was pushin pink Caddies with the fish tank pumps
Bumpin and grindin simultaneously grindin
Climbin up the walls, with my balls, bangin off your hymen
I'm a diamond in the rough (UHH) bustin in your face
Taste the sweetness of my dick, rip your fetus out of place, yo
Bitches already know the repertiore
Step in my car, lets start the menage-a-trois, like Escobar
By far, I'm the best at all sex positions
Forget the kissin, I'm skippin the tongue twistin, see extradition

Chorus

[Big Punisher]
Some chick in back of me bought me a daiquiri
Told me meet her in back of Zachary's 
cause she heard I was packin meat
I bagged the freak and hit the tele'
Got the Phillies, lifted her belly
And "Put it in Her Mouth," like Akinyele
Far from ugly but they used to say I'm too chubby
But since the money the honies got nuttin but love for me
So rub my tummy and make a wish, I'll make you rich
Take your kids to the flicks 
Come back and fix your favorite dish, NOT!!!!
You crazy bitch, I ain't with that, I'mm hit that
Split back to the shack where my other chicks at
Now can you dig that??  I'm the Mack, doin my thing
Pullin your strings, makin you feel like you in a dream
It's the king of the Hip-Hop Quotables, givin you multiples
just by the tone of my voice in the vocal booth
I notice you doin your thing with your crew
Is it aight if I come down there and sing to you?

Chorus: Big Punisher and the O'Jays

"You're my darlin' darlin' baby.."
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
"You're my darlin' darlin' love.."
Uhh, I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
"You're my darlin' darlin' baby.."
Yo, I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
"You're my darlin' darlin' love.."
I'm no player, I just fuck a lot
