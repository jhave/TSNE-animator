Don Mega! *echoes* [repeat line 4X, 2X solo, 2X in background]

Join the party, I can provide the army!!
Join the party, I can provide the army!!!

Verse One: Ice Cube

Come and hear the voice of the man they call the Trojan Horse
Ride on the outside, with inner force
Throw you off course, of course, you missed the runway
We mash, like the first kickoff, on a Sunday
Collisions, divisions of niggaz, down to listen
And when we on the mission, call your mortician
Join the party, I can provide the army!!
First we flank em then we spank em.. I outrank em!
You can call me Citizen Kane, for my reign
Ten years great, one of the ten great
Mr. Media, look inside your encyclopedia
2002, see Ice Cube
Fuck a five-star, I'm a live star
What you got to die for?  Who you wanna ride for?
Fuck dying!  (Fuck dying!)

Don Mega! *echoes* [repeat line 2X]

Verse Two: Ice Cube

It's the suspect king of the roughnecks, bonafide
Worldwide, your highness, the finest
Big as China, nigga rhymer, chart climber
Quick to send a first-timer back to his Aunt Jemimah
Physi-cal, nigga roll with the winners
After these dinners, go out and represent us
We got antennas, scanners and satellites
To see if you battle right, we got to bite
Hold on tight, shake, and pump venom
Some haters don't learn til you leave lead in em
See the dead in em, rigarmortis spread in em
Keep your mouth shut, motherfuckin mouth slug
See these crossed legs, quick to cross Feds
Foe to mighty one, it's the mighty son
Fuck dying! *echoes*

Yeah..

Join the party, I can provide the army!

Fuck dying!!!  I can provide the army (4X)

In the ghetto, in the ghetto
In the city, the suburbs.. penetentiary!

Fuck dying, fuck dying!

Join the party, I can provide the army (yeayayyyy)
Join the party, I can provide the army! (yeayayyyy)
Join the party, I can provide the army!! (yeayayyyy)
