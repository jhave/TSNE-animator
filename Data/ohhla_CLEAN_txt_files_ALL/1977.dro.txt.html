Yeahhh!  You're listening to the sounds, from the Boogie Down Bronx!
Kooool Keith!!  Performing with Mean Jean, Cordio the Grand Wizard
The Ill Brothers, at the T-Connection

Bust them flavors, more rap styles than Life Savors
Damage kids with suits with champagne and fake alligators
I'm for the repercussion, my style is bumrushin
MC's get back, that black brother sound wack
A bust a new style, grease your hair with NuNile
Do wrecks flex the Bronx fronters that step up next
New jacks can't rap, stomp your feet and make your hands clap
The kid is booboo, your screw up on the mic is doodoo
That's word to Mom Duke, you wack you get the boot
It's Casanova, Bronx Kid all over
Swift to shift top MC out to shoot the gift
Morisena Projects, my neighbors took your Rolex
You get action, talkin loud walkin up in Jackson
My little cousin Bronx crew's about to move on you

Yeahhh!  Patterson Projects is in the house!
Webster's in the house! The Non is in the house!
Melrose is in the house!  Jackson, is in the house!
Yeah!

I come real deal rap style back like Holyfield
Check em at the door, and watch crews with steel
With the L Brothers, we hittin freaks undercovers
to the left side, you on the back door
I got a OJ ready, with pink whitewalls
Ah yes yes y'all, and you don't stop the body rock
Cockblock my friends, you count tens in your Benz
Rappers know they toy, I blast your rhyme skill
kid yo, step up like Elroy
You know the steelo, from New York to Puerto Rico
You'll tell me bro... yeah, I'm Kool Keith chief
You been out two weeks
Don't try to ill, cause you're plastic no frill

Yeahhh!  Next week at the P-A-L!!
Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five!
Battling Kool Herc and the Herculoids
Afrika Bambaata and the Mighty Zulu Nation, Soulsonic and Cosmic
Be there!  Two dollars before ten!
With special guests, the Cold, Crush, Brothers!
