[Snoop Dogg]
Bow wow wow

[Ice Cube]
I'm a Nigga Wit an Attitude thanks to y'all
And I don't give a fuck I keep it gangsta y'all
I'ma ride for my side in the C.P.T.
God bless the memory of Eazy-E
If it wadn't for me where the fuck you'd be?
Rappin like the Treacherous Three, fuckin cowards
I'd have seen Dre rockin parties for hours
And I'd have seen Ren fuckin bitches from Howard
And I'd have seen Snoop give away Eddie Bauer's
So fuck Jerry Heller and the white superpowers

[MC Ren]
This the shit niggaz kill for
They hear the villain niggaz spittin' with them nigga flows
Fuck you hoes, fuck you bitch ass niggaz too
Got something for you broke
These niggaz wearin' skirts like the pope
Who them niggaz that you love to get (us)
Who them niggaz that you fuckin' wit' (us)
Love the girl that weed and shit (what)
The saga continues, with the worlds most dangerous group
Four deep in the coup
(Im a spill it)

[Chorus]
I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke (fuck that)
I'ma choke who I wanna choke (fuck that)
I'ma ride where I wanna ride (fuck that)
cause I'ma nigga 4 life, so I'ma nigga til I diz-ie
	(N N, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a) 
I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke (fuck that)
I'ma choke who I wanna choke (fuck that)
	(N N, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a)
I'ma ride where I wanna ride (fuck that)
cause I'ma nigga 4 life, so I'ma motherfuckin nigga til I diz-ie

[Dr Dre]
A pencil, a pen, or a glock
Im the original, subliminal, subterranium
Titianium, criminal minded, swift
D-R-E with that fuck a bitch shit (fuck a biatch)
A couple o' notes and get you hog-tied in rope
Dope like tons of coke, cutthroat
You don't want the pistols to whistle
Candy paint impala
I make hoes pop collars

[Snoop Dogg]
God damn hoes, here we go again
Fuckin with Ren, playin' to win
(he got the) coke in hand, (I got the) juice and gin
Same shit you was fuckin wit way back then
We keep it crackin' from the actin to the jackin
G'ed up C'ed up motherfucker blaze the weed up
We all on deck fool so put your heat up
I stay on deck so me don't get wet

[Ice Cube]
Look my nigga, we can scatter like buckshots
Let's get together, make a record, why the fuck not?
[MC Ren]	Why the fuck not?
[Dr Dre]	Why the fuck not?
[Snoop Dogg]	Why the fuck not?
[Ice Cube]	Cause I'm tight as the night
I had to wipe activator off the mic, in 1985

[Snoop Dogg]
(N N, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a)
Real niggaz, biatch, you know, ha hah

[Ice Cube]
We cause tragedy, erratically
Systematically, in your house without a key
How fucked up that'd be
Gat'll be near your anatomy, my form of flattery

[Dr Dre]
Assault and battery, cus we coming with that street mentality
Straight west coast rider academy
Concrete nigga, that's my reality
[Snoop Dogg]	We tend to bus' on niggaz that get mad at me
[Dr Dre]	Was it a bitch in the mix
[Snoop Dogg]	Well it had to be

[Dr Dre]
Lying tricks told them dicks I had a key
Hoes make the world harder than it have to be
(Yea thats right)

[Chorus]
I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke (fuck that)
I'ma choke who I wanna choke (fuck that)
I'ma ride where I wanna ride (fuck that)
cause I'ma nigga 4 life, so I'ma nigga til I diz-ie

I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke (fuck that)
I'ma choke who I wanna choke (fuck that)
I'ma ride where I wanna ride (fuck that)
cause I'ma nigga 4 life, so I'ma motherfuckin nigga til I diz-ie
