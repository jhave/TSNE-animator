[Silkk]
I click quick, cause my temper is bad
My moms don't like dat, say I got my temper from my dad
When I was a young nigga I used to take thangs
Get locked in my cell &amp; day dream
Shit I been locked down since I was 18
Deep in it, No beef in it
If it's beef in it, I can't sleep in it(get tha gun &amp; creep in it)
Grab tha chrome, it's on
Let it be known, ain't noway to survive
But ride or die
An niggas gotta stay high
An stay by a liquor store, right up in tha hood &amp; shit
I'm flossed out, sittin' up on tha hood of my six
I'm just chillin' tank top like I ain't got no stress
In tha middle of tha project, no bodyguards &amp; no vest
(I love my fans)Me &amp; Magic &amp; C-Murder
In a car that seat thirty
We keep tha heat dirty
Now I'm ain't tryna tell ya I'm a thug
AN I ain't tryna tell ya I sell dope
I'm not tryna convince yall I'm rich, I'ma convince yall I'm broke
(shit I keep it gangsta)

[Chorus: Magic &amp;(Silkk)]
We keep It Gangsta dawg(yo yo)

(Yo yo)
It's been a couple years, I rid myself of tha game
But I'm still thuggin', see habit is tha hardest thang to change
I'm still strugglin', tryna make a name for myself
But I won't rest til' I'm label as tha  muthafuckin' best
I hustled hard, you can see me creepin' to tha top
Thankin' to yaself, will this nigga ever fuckin' stop
I'm still tha same, you can see I got it tatted on my arm
Bitch I been screamin' 9th Ward since tha day I was born
You niggas wouldn't listen but I bet you hear me now
You might not like me as a person but I bet you jock my style
I'm comin' up &amp; I want tha whole world to know
It's my determination dat got me on every fuckin' video
I'm pass up every shittin' hoe
Mashin' every single folk
Dash on every po po dat harash me bout my fuckin' dough
Dat nigga you hear on every radio station
Tha thug niggas demand me, I'm givin' 'em inspiration
It's my turn(it's my turn)

[Chorus: Magic &amp;(Silkk)]
We keep it gangsta dawg(yo yo)

[Silkk]
I keep it gangsta, can't get no gangsta than this
They say if you ain't tha shit now, you ain't never gon' be shit
If you ain't rich now, you ain't never gon' be rich
I told 'em if I can get 7 figures nigga, than why settle for 6
If I got beef &amp; tha cops around I'm gonna relax &amp; click clack later
Tha type of money I'm gonna get, automatically gonna attract haters
I keep a steel, keep it treal, keep it real
Silkk &amp; Mista Magic gonna keep some mills(fuckin' keep it gangsta)

[Magic]
Now I'm drivin' a Navigator
Passin' up all tha haters
I'll see you niggas later
I'm on my way to makin' paper
Nah nigga here can fade us
Bitch we straight creatas
But nuttin' for free, you muthafuckas better pay us
I'm gettin' hot, got niggas changin' they verses
An I ain't I near bout finished it gets a whole lotta worser
I usedta snatch purses, done sent plent niggas to hearse's
If they didn't die then ythey surrounded by nurses(now that's gangsta)
