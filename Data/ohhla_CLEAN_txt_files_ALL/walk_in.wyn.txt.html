[Lil Wayne talking]
Yea yea yea its the Carter motherfucker I came back around
its the Carter motherfucker I came back around
its the Carter motherfucker
let me show you my building man, its the Carter
I'ma show y'all the ins the outs the ups the down, kno what I'm talkin bout
this is me fourth solo album baby, I came back around
by myself this time, back off the wall
guns up in the air in the middle of the streets like blak blak blak, welcome

[Verse 1]
This is the Carter y'all welcome, hard as Malcolm
Dawg is a vulcan Lord help him but y'all felt him
That make you a part of me and pardony
If a part of me is what you wanna be what you oughtta be
Dont worry Carter me I just actin accordingly
I give orders to the commander in chief, just the commander in me
Handlin streets in the mandarin V
I hear you haters slanderin me I just hand him the P
Any drama I pace it like Indiana, I take your grandma pacemaker and jus handle the piece
Not two fingers I simultaneously bout two bangers
You do not want anger USDA prime beef, ya dead meat
I'm so ahead of these trendy rappers speed up
I'm already hot when another one startin to heat up
Got Mannie hot wit me cuz I always beat his beat up
Yall cats wit y'all feet up startin to look like feet up, I'm G'd up
On the V'd up, in the truck I gotta put my seat up
In the trunk I got my bass and I ain't speakin bout no speakers
Whats leakin up out of yo speaker is the speech of Weezy F. Baby
No more no less Baby, so forth and so on
Front door livin room young nigga switchin we
What you need, get you crack get you weed
Make yo way to the back look ahead and see
White bitch in the bathroom givin head for speed
But don't you turn your head at me, the president been doin it
Daddy tried to ruin it
But I built this building from the ruts
I own all the corners and the cuts in this motherfucker
And the feds know just whats up in this motherfucker
Made niggaz so they cant bust in this motherfucker
So with that lets keep it movin, on to the kitchen where my witches keep it brewin
Uh huh look at how my bitches do it
Bucky buck naked look at all my bitches booties
They handle all my pharmaceutics
I got it from promethazane to metamucil
I'm crucial don't mean to spook you
But this is New Orleans so my queens do voodoo, ya know
So the things just move through
I feel ya pain I got things to soothe you
That fills the cane so wayne the nuetral
Dont hate the game hate the institution
That fills the cane so wayne the nuetral
Dot hate the game hate the institution, fucka

[Lil Wayne talking]
I came back around, it's the Carter
show you the rest of the house later, we gon go upstairs, ya kno
Ya kno what this is right
Tha Carter..tha Carter...tha Carter</pre>
