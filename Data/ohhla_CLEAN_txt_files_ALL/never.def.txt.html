[Intro]
Let's keep it real simple
Like that, like that
Yo bring the bass in right here
Woooo! I like that
Um, so nasty
And the synths..
Now we workin!
Yeah, I got a few stories for y'all
Listen up, and it goes like this

[Chorus]
Never say never, cause you never know 
when never's gonna break you down 
And change up all the rules 
It's gonna flip the game, and make a fool of you
I said never say never, cause you never know 
when never's gonna come around
And change up all the rules 
It's gonna flip the game, and make a fool of you
I said...

[Tonedeff]
Yo, ey...
He was a son of a gun, the type of brother to get in trouble for fun
A hustler, always on the hunt for some funds 
From others, knowing how they struggled for crumbs 
He'd loved to hold 'em up and, punk 'em in clubs 
He was a showy motherfucker and such, that prompted suckers to duck 
Something stoic, never buckled or budged 
He moved weight, bitties loved to get a glimpse when he passed 
Screwfaced, but the brother won't dance, no chance 
Still they serving up the ass to 'em, it's don't matter 
He would surely get a pass coolin, he owned the ave 
And didn't swerve with any fast movement, it showed status 
("Real G's never dance") Homey wouldn't have it 
Till one day the sun came tumbling 
His one main slut went to the fuzz with where the drugs lay 
Some say she she must've busted him banging a couple sluts from the Bay 
and he complained to her, now he's contained 
Stuck within tough luck cage with a rough bunkmate, named Terry
..who makes him dance in the commissary, like... 

[Chorus]

[Tonedeff]
Now here's another one, uh... 
She was a lovely soul 
without a judge, she was busty, swole 
She was the woman that no one takes home 
And son, her tolerance for sluts and hoes 
was a quarter shorter than Muggsy Bogues 
She'd run to service every Sunday, scoping all these hussies 
Posing for the pulpit in luxury clothes
Cause they were hunting for the perfect husband 
That comes with a country home, that they could one day own
"I would never settle for funds, I'm grown! 
Gentlemen come with loans, and you're indebted in the bed to the bone 
Selling your skeleton's digusting", Though 
She found a man who was comfortable, and soon their love would grow
They had the wedding of the summer and everything was in front of 'em  
And she'd eventually come to expect the better things coming in 
like expensive clubs and boats, she loved the life  
Then all the sudden she's broke, when he succumbed to a stroke
She couldn't bare to not keep up with the Joneses 
Now her dough comes from lusty roles in the movie "Fuck My Holes" 
Like... 

[Chorus]

[Tonedeff]
Now here's some real shit, uh...
He was a Casanova
Not really, but his talent sold him 
He was crass, but his passion drove up on the curb 
When he rapped, it showed - and ladies certainly had to know him 
He was trapped in the past and sewn up in a pattern
Holding to his oldest habits as a grown up 
To (creep creep) when he was alone he was prone 
Just to (peep peep), any bit porn he could hold 
As a (pre-teen), he begins to hoard what is shown 
Then (extreme scenes), become a resort of his own
As the (weeks keep) coming, and (seeds reap) nothing 
But the hunger for the hunt of the (cheap deed) 
Brother here would (cheat cheat), any single chance that he'd get 
His insecurities surpassed the regrets 
and yet it seems there was a (deep need) for fantasy to match what he'd get 
But he couldn't connect and like it was passenger-sex
And since reality, would have him upset, he vowed to (keep clean)
If he found a (sweet thing), he's positive he'd have to reset 
("Yo, I'll never cheat again if I tie the knot") 
He put a ring on a woman, with a mind to stop 
Now every piece of ass that he met with an eye on his cock 
He felt like he was passing a test, when denying their shot 
But when the times they got hard, he resigned and dropped guard 
And now he lives alone and pays the price for the pop 
(Oh...)

[Outro]
Never is a boulder, teetering on the edge
and your breath can tip it over 
All it takes is one mention to set it in motion 
When never hears its name, then it starts close in 
Never is an army with cannons blazing 
Daring you say shit to make it blatant 
If you never say never then remember to dead it, get it? 
But then you better hide, cause you already said it twice</pre>
