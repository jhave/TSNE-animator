[Violent J]
I battle samurais, they fight like little bitches to me
I've murdered everybody, I need some switches for me
Take me some place, nobody never knew existed
Gone like the missle that missed it and gone balistic
It's floatin' on anybody caught in the way
I'm falling through the future while your back in the day
And know that, there's a storm comin' brewin' up ahead
Black rain as hot as it can get, oh shit

[Hook]
We off the track
Off the track, off the track
Falling freely
Dip on back, back
Flying with me
We off the track
Off the track, off the track
Falling freely
Dip on back, back
Flying with me

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Motherfucker I been droppin' freestyles, for fifty three miles
We drop some nuclear bombs, we tryin' to see smiles
I caught a shootin' star inside a peanut butter jar
We bring it in the vocal booth and beam out like rayzars
We draw crop circles, that prints sky purples
Cast out colorful shiny diamonds wonderful
I'm not the one that bullshit about the thunder though
We keep it juggalo, we underground and mo'
Rockin' shows in my underwear, never been the one to care
Spend every penny that we ever made on weed and beer
I make the rainest, but the joker cards is ever famous
And who can blame us, the carnival became us
I'm sleepin' in the clouds, leaping through the night sky
I fantasize, let you see something beyond your eyes
I seen the galaxy, ate Lucky Charms off the Milky Way
But tommorow gonna be the day, we off the tracks

[Hook]
We off the track
Off the track, off the track
Falling freely
Dip on back, back
Flying with me
We off the track
Off the track, off the track
Falling freely
Dip on back, back
Flying with me

[Break]
And we gon' ride high
Swerve left and right high
All night
We gon' ride high
Swerve left and right high
All night

[Violent J]
You gotta meet me to believe me, and beat me to achieve me
And vision through your third eye to even try to see me
I'm too dramatic, I'll slap you with the Sledge-O-Matic
I'm on your TV screen, talkin' through the static
On the beaches of Afghanistan, talkin' to the reefer man
Caught in a avalanche and don't need an ambulance
Come with me, I'll show you how to relax
Dark Carnival wagons is flying off the tracks
So come on...

[Hook]
We off the track
Off the track, off the track
Falling freely
Dip on back, back
Flying with me
We off the track
Off the track, off the track
Falling freely
Dip on back, back
Flying with me

[Break]
And we gon' ride high
Swerve left and right high
All night
We gon' ride high
Swerve left and right high
All night

[Hook]
We off the track
Off the track, off the track
Falling freely
Dip on back, back
Flying with me

[Violent J]
