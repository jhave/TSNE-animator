Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus x2]
Classic, Sinatra, bad, Phantom of the Opera
Shuffle the deck, I be the queen in the pack
Gotcha, Lady Patra

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Paper planes, roger that, 10-4
Got money, been had it, still gettin' more
All y'all in the building, but on different floors
Y'all couldn't see it how we see it on your tippie-toes
It get so chillin', so pretty, still pretty
Talkin' hits on hits, Maguire gones Griffin
[?]
Pearl handle on the pistol, tell this world to come and get me
And I'm thummin' through designers to pick what you feel me proper
Hay dudes come through the ranks, but we ain't shabba
Need me a rude boi, something straight out the shockers
Could drive a girl crazy, all the way off my rocker
Versaces over Allies, lookin' like you could pop a
No they thought I wouldn't make it, I'm lookin' like what's the matter?
But tell the money talk and that man not saying nada
The new classic, signed sincerely, Lady Patra

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: Mavado]
She's special, a phenomenon
Body strong like a stallion
She got me wild like an animal
Drop it, drop it, pon the floor
Drop it, drop it, pon the floor
[?]
Tell 'em broke bitch, read it in the books
You think tonight you got Louie and the [?]
[?]

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: Mavado]
She said she need a real man
Oh yes she want a real one
So she fuck with a Jamaican
Done (Haha!)
Your body looking like a million dollar
The baddest bitch you ever seen
They wanna wanna be my baby momma
I fuck her like my [?]

[Chorus x2]</pre>
