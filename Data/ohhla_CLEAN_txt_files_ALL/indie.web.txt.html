[Chorus]
I-n-d-e-p-e-n-d-e-n-t do you know what that mean [Repeat 2x]
She got to her own house
She got her own car
Two jobs work hard you a bad broad
If you aint on sit down [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 1: Webbie]
I-n-d-e-p-e-n-d-e-n-t do you know what that mean
Baby Phat just relax
Front your own flat screen 
Back rub, cook, clean, and don't make her make a scene
When u callin her on her cellular she tell u she'nt need not a got damn thang
You a hot damn thang 
If you think u finna get her wit a got damn chain
You insane, boy you better get some gotdamn change
You a fool, been to school
Even walked across the stage 
And she say I love webbie
From his looks to his ways
The stilettos the J's depend on how the weather look
Flip flop slippers just to show off the pedicure
Flip flop niggaz jus depend on how the cheddar look
She'll buy her own I don't think she'll never look
In a man face standin waitin for him to take care of her
She'll rather go to work and pay the bills on schedule

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lil Phat of 3-Deep]
She a dome dime diva
Gutta like Keisha
Work that meter
Cuz she a good freaka
Cuz she stay on her shit
She got her own shit
She don't neva trip cuz all she want is that dick
She bouncy flossy keep them hoes off me
Gutta lil slang man I love when she talkin
A independent chick do you know what that mean
She cook she clean neva smell like onion rings
22's on her whip 
Oh she do it large (she do it large)
When she break a nigga off 
Got a nigga spoiled
She a bad lil chick
A fly lil chick
Hit me on my phone she like to buy that dick
Got her stunna shades on lookin like sumthin
Stallion hair long she a nice sumthin
Like to go to the mall er'day for an outfit
Hair did, nails did ,Independent what she call it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
She got her own house 
Drive her own whip
Range rover all white...like her toe tips
She got a pretty smile ..smell real good
Only time she need a man for that good jug
They buy the bar too
They superstars too
They be like you aint got no money take yo broke tail home
In Baby Phat they on
They cloths match they phone
They be like YEAH!!! when they song come on
Leave the club kinda early
Cuz they gotta go to work
I mess wit supervisors who got credit like Big Turk
So dusty feet please don't bother me
I got independent dimes on my mind...who spoil me
Gucci hat...Gucci fit so sick
That's a gift from my independent chick yes sir!
Tryna get me next to her gotta be yaself mayne
cause she got her own money she don't need no help mayne (Boosie!)</pre>
