[Redman (Al Green sample)]
Yeah, Gilla!

Yeah, Gilla!
(Right now, right now, right now, right now)
Ladies and gentlemenâ¦Al Green!

[Verse 1: Redman]
Yo! Yo dogg!
I'mma get this - shhhhhhh! - up, poppin' like "Yeah!"
Chicken drawers be droppin' like "Yeah!"
I keep a dirty apartment like "Yeah!"
Fall when I hit the target like "Yeah!"
Y'know how it be, yo!
Rep that hood, Clint Easthood
Neighborhoods never sleep good, I make it understood
My shoes too big
Violate, you'll be gettin' your news through B.I.G.
A big rig for a big kid - that's me!
I should've got a scholarship for Athlete's Feet
Duck Down - breathe, pure uncut
I can bag it in dimes, +Freakniks+ like +Beat Stree+t
A-T-L, beat-beat, what the deal?
You +Okay+ like Ciara, let's freakâ¦for now!
Gotta' build my clientele like Nino
Hip hop's +Departer+, I +Deboe+ the East Coast
Three's a crowd, keep two in the peep coat
When I in, I do it again like TiVo
Doctor, bill it!
Blocks gonna feel it!
Def Jam, feel it!
Street team, deal it!
I'm back in the game again - ughhhh! - y'all
My money kinda' short, so I'm comin' for y'all
G-I-Double L-A, be out in L.A.
+Child+ was +Destine+ like 'Chelle be and Kelly

[Chorus 2x's: Redman (Al Green sample)]
Hold up! Wait a minute! Tell me again!
Yo, when you gonna drop it?
(Right now, right now, right now, right now)
Not now, but right now! GILLA!
Not now, but right now! GILLA!

[Verse 2: Redman]
You know what it is!
Yo dogg! I be in the UK, gettin' boo-tay
You at home, gettin' loose change for a bouquet
Too late, got cha girl by my two braids
And a sidekick 'cause the chick go two ways!
Heyyyy! Doctor +Inda Buildin'+
Never get gassed when the camera filmin'
"Blaow! Blaow!" - Don't know the half
As soon as somethin' "Brrrrrrrat!" - Haul ASS!
Me, I'm never scared, I die on my two feet
And you confused like a Jew wearin' kufis
I'll rip your MC, no matter whose street
Call ?? and how Doc abuse loose-leaf
Yeah, I bought a jeep sellin' loosies
GILLA! The illest since Thrilla Of Manilla
Chickens on yo' block, know I'm that GILLA!
Yo  - ugh! - got Botox and mine's on liquor!

[Chorus 2x's: Redman (Al Green sample)]
Hold up! Wait a minute! Tell me again!
When you gonna drop it?
(Right now, right now, right now, right now)
Not now, but right now! GILLA!
Not now, but right now! GILLA!

[Verse 3: Redman]
Yo, if your block on fire
I come through and put it out with my saliva
Through each paragraph in ultraviolet
Got neighborhoods - "Hi dogg, I'm the palette"
Blunt or a chalice, Red is the Wildest
I'm on some newâ¦shhhh!
You on my oldâ¦shhh!
You just confused it
Doc is the Boss here, nobody move now!
Method: Desert Storm, leavin' no clue around!
Smell manure now, Redman stinkin'
AA meetings, my ink-pen drinkin'
Dead men don't blink, I +Stay Alive+
Since a Bee Gee, I kept +Fire In My Eye+
Erick Sermon back, homey never left
Now the beats he bang, make you rubberneck
I'll bounce you like a voice-check
I'm a +Bulldog+ like I'm a Ge-Ge-Georgetown HOYA!

[Chorus 4x's: Redman (Al Green sample)]
Hold up! Wait a minute! Tell me again!
When you gonna drop it?
(Right now, right now, right now, right now)
Not now, but right now! GILLA!
Not now, but right now! GILLA!
