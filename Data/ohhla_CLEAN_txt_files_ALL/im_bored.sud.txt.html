Typed by: www.suddendeath.org

Get dragged to places I don't wanna go
I stand around all day and then you know
I fall alseep standing up and hit my face on the floor
I'm bored

Sitting in a place I don't wanna be
Why in the world does this happen to me
Oh wow, oh gosh, oh golly gee
I'm bored

My blood pressure is at an all time low
My relation with my neighbor is status quo
There's nothing left to do but watch the grass grow
I'm bored

I'm bored, I'm bored, oh yes indeed
I'm bored, I'm bored, now can't you see
My life is filled with misery
I'm bored

I shoot down flies with a B.B. gun
I spend my spare time playing chess with a nun
Time sure flies when you're having fun
I'm bored

I sneezed and my hand got covered in goo
So now I can't do the German Boogaloo
OK homebody, now what are we gonna do
I'm bored

I'll stand on my head and play with my toes
Build a jigsaw puzzle from Cheerios
Use a needle and thread to pick my nose
I'm bored

I'm bored, I'm bored, can't think of no lines
I'm bored, I'm bored, can't think of no rhymes
So I'll just sit around and waste some more time
I'm bored</pre>
