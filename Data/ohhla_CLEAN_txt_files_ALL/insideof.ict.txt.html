Yeah 
This is Ice-T
I'ma slow it down for a minute
I wanna talk to all the ladies out there
I got my man J-e-ll in the house
I got a message I wanna send out to all the fly ladies, yeah
Check me out

[ VERSE 1: Ice-T  ]
It's time for me to kick game
And if I can't do it, then ladies, Ice ain't my name
Now real brothers ain't easy to understand
And it's a long hard road to become a man
Drama seeks and chases him through every year
His homie dies, you might see him shed a tear
But mostly hardcore feelings are all you see
Cause you gotta be raw to be called a gee
But every man slows down
You'll see this side when there's probably no one around
And there's no safer place
Than if you ever are some gee's homebase
But it ain't easy, these brothers got barricades around the hearts
It's gonna take time before the trust starts
But girl, you must be true
Cause if your man's a gee, he'll definitely die for you
Look him deep in his eyes, let him know you're there
Show him that you really care
Trust me, you move with time
Through the darkened halls of his mind
You just might find

Yo, Jell
You know what I'm sayin?
I try to represent for all the brothers out there
And I know my latin homies have the same drama with they girls, man
Won't you let em know how it's goin down

[ VERSE 2: Jell ]
Man, I'm lookin for a hina that's down
But you don't have to be brown
If you wanna hang around
All you gotta do is stay in check
Cause if you're rubbin me right
Then you can bet you'll get respect
And that's why I guess my feelings will have to show
How can you hide somethin that's in your soul?
Cause there's more to the l-o-c
Than all the violence, baby, that ain't who I be
I know my dogs and me can still pull straps
But I rather have you rollin in my Cadillac
Cause when we cruisin, thangs is all good
And that goes for every vato in the hood
Now sometimes it's hard to show the other side
Especially when my crew is caught up in a homicide
Cause East L.A. don't play
And if I had my way
I'd kick it with you everyday

[ Ice-T ]
Whether black or brown, the situation's the same
Different hoods, but the same game
Some girls won't take their time
Others will stroll through our souls and find
