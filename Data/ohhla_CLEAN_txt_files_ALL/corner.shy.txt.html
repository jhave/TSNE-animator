[L.E.O.]
Hakuna, the world love to see, a real sucka free
A real fucking G, like a muthafucking me
Unlucky me, there's this little hung thing
Niggas think I come from a different nut bring
Bring up ring, got to say love queen
Check boy, check pawn, makes niggas give up chins
Let's make war, make the best both win
Make an invest, or put a check before friend
Play wit that best raw, come or compress form
So pure can't afford to step on the stretch more
Look at fiends cribs and let them shop for us
Whatever, stick to the jars and let for them
Nigga stick to ya job or get left for 'em
Niggas better stick to God, before death call 'em
Let's warn 'em informers swarming the corner
And the significance of a closed mouth is so important

[L.E.O.]
The warden talk to the judge, the judge talk to the warden
The warden tell a pot, help me if this shit falling
The oil said, I ain't hear ya niggas talking
Let me out pa, I'm freezing, I see ya rock frozen
Scraps saying in court I had a block warming
Next call, I had the whole rock scorching
His young boy said, let me get off it
Then wit 6-2-2, or half off this little bullshit
And my portion going right back in stock
Just let me hold a block then you get ya own pot
That sounding good, meet me down in the hood
At Crackhead Loraine's she gon' make the pounds cook
And when the pounds cook, I show you how the town look
They different but they ain't pussy, they out of town crook
So now we here, prepared, she want money
But without a plate, she use police as escape
Next day young boy, she scratched, she gotta go
She playing with police for a play, ain't even pay what she owe
