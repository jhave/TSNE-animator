Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You got that ass clapping, that's a case dance
Like I'm Reginald ladies man!
He came in this bitch looking like a paid man
Threw some money on that pussy, made her rain dance
Pourin out the dankin, got the girls drinking
Girl ask me who I was, bitch I'm famous
Smart bitch need a chick that don't speak no English
Hardcore tied her up, bitch like danger!
She thirsty! She no longer fuck with no rookies
Niggas are mad, but they don't wanna push me
Party over here, let your fools take my groupies
I'm fucking with these blind bitches and then he brought Snooki
I Jersey shore all these whores like the nest
I don't give a fuck, I just give up my sex, I'm a cold nigga
Separate me from rest, fully gang bang, then I DNG to the next!

[Chorus]
Ain't no playing hard to get girl
What's up?
Fuck her with a nigga who don't give a fuck
Drop it down to the floor and pick it back up
Racks in my pocket, I'm a live it up!
Rain dance, rain dance
Fuckin with a nigga, who don't give a fuck
Rain dance, rain dance
Stacks on the floor, girl pick it up

Fully click, got her on that groupie shit
She don't really rap much, but I see the coochie spit
Club couch got them whoopy stains
Rain dancing in the pussy and it made the pussy rainKeepin it G like two bops vegetarians, bop loading like they full hot
Them hoes always pop up but with you, they never with it
I be on my homer shit always fucking yellow bitches
Seen her, barely need to meet her poppin Miley, Now she rollin on the wood
Atleast it steam her, steam her hot bust a new whip, pulled out that good zip
Light a fire in the tent smoky in the wood's pits
Sour ain't as sweet but it ain't contradicting
Stripping that ass, why that ass ain't evicted
She coming for the team, on some mascot shit
Fuckin with the foolies and her ass got rich

[Chorus:]
Ain't no playing hard to get girl
What's up?
Fuck her with a nigga who don't give a fuck
Drop it down to the floor and pick it back up
Racks on my pocket, I'm a live it up!
Rain dance, rain dance
Fuckin with a nigga, who don't give a fuck
Rain dance, rain dance
Stacks on the floor, girl pick it up

Yeah, she make you steam like something smoking
Gun-na, make it busted open
Focus, Shawty wanna come and go on
Pants saggin the belt for the money, holdin!
Cash money, bitch! I'm from crack city
Show off in a T-raw rack city
Know she do it ugly, cause she that pretty
Feelin beams [?] in the P.M. but I cat kitty
Except to me I let you see'em if she act shitty
Hypnotize her with the ring until she act dizzy
I got the strap with me, an some straps with me
If they're tryin' twap Drizzy where they at Trizzy
YMCMB Militia fo sure
She know the deal with the deal, so she Kosher
On to my next, ex, though it won't hurt
We the new boys, nigga keep that old work

[Chorus]
Ain't no playing hard to get girl
What's up?
Fuck her with a nigga who don't give a fuck
Drop it down to the floor and pick it back up
Racks on my pocket, I'm a live it up!
Bring ya friends two guns, we gon' get turned up
Pass around a [?] girls drink it up
Live it up fuck it we don't give a fuck
We came in this bitch like what's up</pre>
