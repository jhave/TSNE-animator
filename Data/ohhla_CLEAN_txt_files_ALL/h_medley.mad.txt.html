	[Britney]
I made it through the wilderness, somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat incomplete, I've been had
I was sad and blue, but you made me feel, yeah
You made me feel shiny and new, oh, oh

	[Christina]
Like a virgin, ooh, touched for the very first time, oh
Like a virgin, when your heart beats next to mine, oh, oh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh

	[Madonna]
Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good
Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good

	[All]
Shine you light now
This time it's got to be good
You'll get it right now, yeah
Cos you're in Hollywood
You're in Hollywood

	[Madonna]
Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good
Everybody comes to Hollywood

	[Missy]
Yo, yo, yo
Who that be, Missy Elliott, M-I-C
I works it and I works it
Can I flip my thing and revese it
Come on, go, go head, go, go head
I works it and I works it
Can I flip my thing and reverse it
Come on, go, go head, go, go head
Party people, we'll show you how to work that
Where you at, Madonna

Trip the station, change the channel
Hollywood, Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good
Hollywood, Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good

	[All]
Hollywood, Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good
Hollywood, Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good
Music stations always play the same songs
We're bored with the concepts of right and wrong
