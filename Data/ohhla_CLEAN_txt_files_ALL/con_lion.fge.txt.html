The conquering lion
Shall break every chain
The conquering lion
Shall break every chain
Give him the victory
Again and again and again and again
Give him the victory
Ohh

The conquering lion
Shall break every chain
The conquering lion
Shall break every chain
Give him victory
Again and again and again and again and again and again
Give us some victory
Ohh, yeah
Ohh, conquering lion

Shall break every chain, every chain, every chain
The conquering lion, yeah ohh
Shall break every chain
Give us some victory
We need some victory
We need some victory
Again and again and again and again
Give, give, give, us some victory
Ohh, ohh, ohh

The conquering lion
He'll break every chain
Every one of your chains, every one of your chains
The conquering lion
Hey, he's gonna break all of those chains if you just let him
Give him, give him the victory, give him the victory
Again and again and again and again
Give him the victory
Ohh, ohh, ohh</pre>
