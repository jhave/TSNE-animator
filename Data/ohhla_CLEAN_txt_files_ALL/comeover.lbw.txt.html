[Pleasure P - Chorus]
When I Come over
I ain't comin to play no games
When I come over
You betta be ready for me
li-lingire, sliky lace
Turn off the phone cuz ima turn ya on
When I come over
We gone make this a night to remember

Baby girl when you gonna let me beat it up
Treat you like a entree girl and eat it up
You wont talk wit ya legs in the air
Pullin' on your hair
Girl I know you like it rough
Cuz you into that freaky stuff
Baby come over whenever you wanna
Baby girl I'm gonna, put it on ya
And I cant lie shawty hotter than the Arizona summer
And she get it from her mama
You can hit me on a late night tip
I heard you can drive a stick
Ima shift ya gear lil mama tell me if ya can handle it
And I make a baby come fast
Ima beast in the sheets when it comes to the bedroom
Ima go down low, go lick a lil bit
Yeah shawty,thats what a real man do
We gon smoke a blunt or two
Then get right back at it, fuckin like rabbit
All night long with an RnB song
Your sex like a drug n girl I'm yo addict
All you gotta do is call me up
And Ima go deep cuz its long enough
We can do it in the kitchen, or the shower
Cuz it dont matter, in the living room on the furniture

[Chorus]

Girl take yo thong off
If ya dont know now baby girl ima super freak
Forget cha home girl, cuz you all mine and ya girl with Pleasure P
Oow man she soaking wet
Girl we can film it and upload it onto the internet
And the way nigga beat it from the back
You screamin my name, kissin on ya girl, and bitin ya neck
Knockin picture off the wall
And she go both way, thats right, like girl too
? no girl I love you
Let me tell ya whatcha gon do
Lay back on the bed
Clenchin the sheet tight while she givin me head
Man I swear to god I aint never had nothing like this before
And she make a nigga wanna go
Break up with his wife, change his life
She call me up anytime the night
Ima come over, lay the pipe, whatever she like
When I come over she already know what time it is
No talking girl, thats right, lets get it poppin then

[Chorus]</pre>
