[Chorus]
Whoa whoa
She on another level
Like whoa whoa
We ready for whatever
Like whoa whoa
She on another level
Like whoa whoa
We ready for whatever
She fine as a super model
Built like a coke bottle
Hips like handle bars
Shorty's stopping all the cars
Yup
Put that thang down
Do it
Put that thang down
Get to it
Put that thang down
Shes good
Put that thang down

[D-Roc]
Hey how ya doin lil mama D-Roc's my name
Let me introduce you to my brother kane

Lets sneak off and start handleing thangs
Lets make it to my room quick
Hey shorty wait till you see my dick
Let the dog just beat up your cat
Whisper in your ear shorty how you like dat

[Chorus]

[Kaine]
To the strip club hoe (strip club hoe)
Dancin in the club takin off they clothes

Making her move quick so you all her steal

Make dat booty go round and round
The way she dance she getting cash
Whisper in her ear I like dat

[Chorus]

[Teedra Moses]
Listen here daddy I'm a grown ass woman

Cause if you ready for it just say that your ready for it
Baby cause I am ready for whatever you ready for

Hips like handle bars
Shorty's stopping all the cars
Yup
Put that thang down

Put that thang down
Get to it
Put that thang down
Shes good
Put that thang down</pre>
