Its ya boy Chevy P babe...
Listen

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
I remember as a kid back.. in the days
I got picked on kicked at... shit on spit at
Get gone get back (gone Smoke) get away
Havin a dark pigmentation was hard then to make friends
Felt like God didn't take his time with me
He musta made me late night tired and sleepy
Cause life wasn't easy they dogged me
Said that I was so dark the bet I could sweat coffee
And peepee sweet tea and spit oil
Say when ashy I lotion down in Armor All
Made me feel like a loser really lame
Because of my complexion nobody would include me in games
Not even tag never "it" nobody would touch me
Nope no girlfriends cause shawties thought I was ugly
Through all the jokes and laughs pokes and stabs blows and jabs
Hopin sad mopin mad before the scabs nobody told me that...

[Hook w/ 2Pac sample from "Keep Ya Head Up"]
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
(this song is to all the dark skinned)
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say
The blacker the berry t-the blacker the berry
the blacker the blacker the blacker the blacker

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
I ain't have Marvin Gaye to sing to me
And make me feel like black was the thing to be
Until Big Daddy Kane I was so glad he came
Made me feel good about bein black again cause
We was at the bottom of the market
+Al B.+ made +Sure+ it was a problem to be dark skinned
Until +Wesley Sniped+ him
In with the darkies out with the light skinned
Now we got Tyrese Taye and Tyson
Mekhi Phife in every movie ya likin
Blade he remind me of a modern day Panther
While Batman +hides behind a mask+ like a +Klansman+
We have to achieve... +'Caine's killin us+
Like it killed the second son of Adam and Eve
Ya palm is white and spreaded fist still black and tightly now
Slappin five was cool but rather ya ball ya fist and give me pound
'cause

[Hook]

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
Tiger Woods say he ain't black... whatever
They say Michael Jackson ain't white... whatever
And Venus and Serena done beat mo white girls
Than O.J. and Rick James put together
Now Michael Vick's the new black hero
Bet John Madden ain't see it comin
(saw a quarterback as a negro)
Jordan he can't hide it he look like an African Tribal leader
If you can lighten him then you can brighten me up
Now don't get me wrong and think I'm prejudiced
Listenin to this song.. I'm not racist
As a matter of fact shout out to Jamie Lori and Chad
My white friends from Lee County to Bladecliff
Just bein dark is it whats like bein white in the audience
At a black comedy show I
Was guaranteed to get cracked on and joked out
Now this ugly duckling is a swan I know now

[Hook]

It's the F-B-I
