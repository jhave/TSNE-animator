DY!
You know!
Masivo!
We run the world!
Daddy!

Come and fall back
Limbo! Keep movin' your feet
And get low,
Drop and do the limbo!

Come and fall back
Limbo! Keep movin' your feet
And get low,
Drop and do the limbo!
Limbo!

Give it up for the summer time
Come on, come, come on one more time!
Pa' pasarla caliente, it's time to go crazy
Yo, DJ, let it run
It's so hot under the sun
We wanna turn it up!

Give it up for the summer time
Come on, come, come on one more time!
Pa' bailarlo caliente, not stoppin', my baby
Yo, DJ, let it run
It's so hot under the sun
We wanna turn it up!

Zu-zu-zumba!

Here we go!
Take it down!
[?]
Limbo!
Pull it back!
One to the left and you pull it back!
One to the right and you pull it back!
[?]
Feel that fire
And you pull it back!
Pull it back!
P-p-pull it back come on!

Oh eh oh
When you're feelin' me,
Get up and dance!
Oh eh oh
Seguimos hasta el amanecer!

Come and fall back
Limbo! Keep movin' your feet
And get low,
Drop and do the limbo!
Limbo!
Come on, get down, boys!

Come and fall back
Limbo! Keep movin' your feet
And get low,
Drop and do the limbo!
Limbo!

Give it up for the summer time
Come on, come, come on one more time!
Pa' pasarla caliente, it's time to go crazy
Yo, DJ, let it run
It's so hot under the sun
We wanna turn it up!
Zu-zu-zumba!

Give it up for the summer time
Come on, come, come on one more time!
Pa' bailarlo caliente, not stoppin', my baby
Yo, DJ, let it run
It's so hot under the sun
We wanna turn it up!
Zu-zu-zumba!

Lean back to the flow!
Limbo!
Un chico, limbo!
All over the world, limbo!
Show what ya got!
Show what ya got!
We callin' everybody
Come on, and join the party!
Go ahead and work your body!
No lo pare ahora!

Dime oh eh oh
When you're feeling me,
Get up and dance!
Oh eh oh!
Seguimos hasta el amanecer!

From Miami down to Arruba
To the Bahamas
Spendin' that moola, ma'
Show me how you limbo!

[?]
Not forgetting the weekend, yeah!
All because we follow the limbo!
So, let's go!

Give it up for the summer time
Come on, come, come on one more time!
Pa' pasarla caliente, it's time to go crazy
Yo, DJ, let it run
It's so hot under the sun
We wanna turn it up!
Zu-zu-zumba!

Give it up for the summer time
Come on, come, come on one more time!
Pa' bailarlo caliente, not stoppin', my baby
Yo, DJ, let it run
It's so hot under the sun
We wanna turn it up!
Fue-fue-fuego!

Pull it back!
One to the left and pull it back!
One to the right and pull it back!
[?]
And pull it back!
Pull it back!
P-p-pull it back come on!

Ma-ma Masivo!
Ma-ma Masivo!
Ma-ma Masivo!
