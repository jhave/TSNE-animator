50 Cent
Niggas, niggas copy my style Russ
That's why I had to switch up on 'em
Knahmean? Man niggas sound like me

[Verse 1]
I run the show now, I got the blow now
You wanna O now? You can come cop
I'm on the low now, I got the fo' pound
In case a mother fucker got to get shot
The old timers tell me, slow down
See they know now, I won't hesitate to make shit hot
D's will shut your block down, after your shot down
We gonna come through and set up shop
You niggas gon' work for me now, you gon' see now
How I change shit, re-arrange shit
See for you dog, this is new shit
I'm from Southside, nigga we do this
They say I'm grimey, it's hard to find me
When the sun lighten up the sky
Niggas wanna line me, try and kill me
Go 'head nigga I dare you to try, fuck that nigga!

[Chorus]
We movin on up, yeah we gettin' that dough, fo' sho'
We movin on up, yo' whip chromed up
Cash is flow fo' sho, the dough, nigga you know what?
We movin on up, yeah we gettin' that dough, fo' sho'
We movin on up, yo' whip chromed up
Cash is flow fo' sho, the dough, nigga you know what?

[Verse 2]
Im 'bout my bread now, I'll cut your head now
You know you eatin' niggas you should be dead now
I hold a glock down, I gotta drop now
Nigga I'm eatin' you know I aint gon' stop now
One more trip, one more flip
I move a truckload nigga, not one brick
They make me so sick, fuckin' sick to my stomach
You niggas talk shit, but they know they don't I want it
My clicks so sick, niggas know how we on it
Light up more shit, the car there when we on it
I spit a gem star get'cha carved my name on yo' neck
Have my lil homies run up on yo' ass with the tech
Yeah I stunt in the Vette , got stash in the bank
I get head in the whip, I get ass on the jet
I'm oh so fresh, so  motherfuckin' clean
24" Inch gleam, when I pull up on the scene

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Been smokin' that dip, the PCP got 'em thinkin' they can walk on water
That ecstasy will have a nigga rock hard tryna fuck your daughter
The LSD will have niggas runnin' round tryna kill you for us
Smokin' that piff, sippin' that yak, talkin' that shit, loadin' that strap

[Chorus]</pre>
