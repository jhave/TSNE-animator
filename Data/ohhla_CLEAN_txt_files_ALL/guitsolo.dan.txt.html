My little nigga fourteen...
Got his hand on the forty with the infrared beam
His daddy locked up and his mama is a fiend
Catch her trickin' on the corner, knees dirty on her jeans
At night he never dreams cause he hardly ever sleep
Layin' in the bed facin' someone else's feet
So late night he creep, walk around these streets
With the same hoodie on, he been wearin' for a week
He wants something to eat, and his sneaks so scuffed
Just lookin' in his eyes, you can tell he livin' rough
Standing outside a gas station puffin' on a loosie
Dropped outta school cause his peers appeared bougie
And they wear gucci, and shit that rappers talk
Robbed an old lady but his ass got caught
Will he get out, man I really don't know bro
I hope I'll find out after the guitar solo

After the guitar solo...
The guitar solo...
After the guitar solo...
The guitar solo...

This little girl pregnant man she only fourteen
Bust in by an older nigga, lack of self-esteem
Her mom's a gold-digger, and her dad is not around
Last time she saw him he took her to Belle Isle
A child with a child and her mama don't care
Another bridge card gon' put her on welfare
Baby daddy say he got her, prolly won't succeed
Cause he bought a pair of cardi's 'stead of reing-up the weed
His dream is a cutty with some rims on that bitch
Is that the type of man you want raising your kids?
So now you ditch class cause your belly getting bigger
And every other day yo' mama fuck another nigga
So what she gonna do is find herself a drug dealer
Her dream and goal in life is to be saved by a nigga
And will she get far? I really don't know bro
I hope I find out after the guitar solo

The guitar solo...
After the guitar solo...
The guitar solo...
Guitar solo...</pre>
