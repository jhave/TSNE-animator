{*helicopter flying overhead*}
"Outside the South Central area, few cared about the violence
 because - it didn't affect them." - Tom Brokaw

  "Break 'em off somethin" - Ice Cube

[Chorus]
  "Back to the criminal set... but they can't catch me yet" - Ice Cube
Don't trip you might break your neck {"break 'em off somethin"}
And get wet from the reign of the tec, I {"break 'em off somethin"}
  "Back to the criminal set... but they can't catch me yet" - Ice Cube
Your gum bumpin gon' lead to gun bumpin {"break 'em off somethin"}
I'm the one when the party is jumpin to {"break 'em off somethin"}

[Xzibit]
I heard the O.G.'s they don't hit
And I'm the only one left from the West that you can't fuck with
But lately I've been feelin like Will Smith
Why bother with rap when I can get 20 mill' on a flick?
Y'all niggaz just started some shit, the underdog
Makin songs for them hogs, and them Bloods and Crips
For the shah by the mall with a Muslim scent
After all, who do you call to rock your shit? {"break 'em off somethin"}
Bust the ghetto bird, circle above, reminisce
of the dust kicked up, the dirt swept under the rug
Duct tape, ski-mask, tape recorders
Cue Kaze, ready to blaze and bakin soda
First learned how to cook in a coffee pot
Made the block get hot like lava rock
Got love for the block cause I came from that
But I ain't afraid to go right back {"break 'em off somethin"}

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
It's a, suicide it's a suicide
If you ever get the heart to try fuckin with mines
No change, I'm poppin the nine, you ridin the pine {"break 'em off somethin"}
The heavy metal knock you out of your mind {"break 'em off somethin"}
Now how many really gon' ride, when the war start?
Eaten alive by these hollow-tip darts
My 12 gauge'll tear you apart, don't get caught at the light
the house party or the neighborhood park
Mr. X marks the spot then pops the mark
Turn your whole neighborhood to a parkin lot
I paid the cost to be the boss
and will do my time standin up 'til I get an appeal
These weapons too real to conceal, so why bother
Semper fidelis, I learned from my father
I always stay faithful to myself and grow
But when I catch that ass after the show - {"break 'em off somethin"}

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
I'm slick and slippery
On a high-speed chase all the way to the victory
Y'all niggaz is stone cold mysteries
Too weak, can't stand in the ring with me
Put a pussy back in his place, straightlaced
With a Strong Arm Steady gang up in your face
I run a race with the West to my back
While you're the reason why they say niggaz in the West can't rap
Ever since the white Concourse 'Llac, I've been unmatched
A avalanche in the hood on attack
Just hardcore actual facts, never wait
Just react when them killers come at you with gats
Had to dig the knife out of my back, now I'm back on track
Hittin laps, 'bout to widen the gap yo
It ain't the long fall from the top that got 'em
It was the sharp sudden stop at the bottom, haha {"break 'em off somethin"}

[Chorus]
