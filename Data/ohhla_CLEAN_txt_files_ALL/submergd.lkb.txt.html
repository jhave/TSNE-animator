Leak Leak Leak
Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak
Leak Leak Leak Leak
Leak Leak Laek

[Tame One]
Well adjusted to being dusted
Control the dangerous substance
My comeuppens is what's up in these dutches leak brothers fuck with
With 2 anti role models who hold bottles to dip
Of the you know, H20, the bugged out drug duo
With scooba tank dank, top ranked
I'm sort of a Moses
Split water just to walk through it when waterworld frozes
The Heemie Houdini, I be escapin from the jug, taking this drug
Patientially waiting, lacing a dub
Run into Dusted Dons, I'm embalming the pack
Hazing and glazing over what's poppin just like crackerjacks
With dust in my pores, soak every dutch in the store
Off a frybone, it isn't my turn, Tyrone Wiggums
I get blunted redundant till the wet mess with my stomach
And with one dip I pimp, one hit, I get something from him
My sorry chicks probably corrupt cosmic kids
Ask Theo if he know how wet this bombsie is

[Cage &amp; El-P]
We are not concerned with how this planet turns
People get murdered every day as someone tanning burns
The same programmed passed down, each family learns
Turn 18, given a gun, her hand is sherm
get used to breath the water when the land's submerged
You get a chance to say goodbye to all your mans and birds
Why your vision is just a serious of random blurs
You can read between the lines of which the tangent curves

[Cage]
Last flight of steps up to the portal from the fridge
Omar Dipps got the juice now and I know the ledge
He said "leak from the roof", with a mop I lab on the way down
Consider it to those who gotta clean me off the ground
Kids dying to hate us, was born to love us
Jarhead but ain't got no Glassjaw like Warner Brothers
The greedy ends the time travel, unravel a blasphemy
Like Jesus casually cremated angels in the bag for me
The most favorite corpse is alive in songs
But to the coroner's surprise arrived in balm
I go postal with envelopes especially empties
When I missuse the music like a pack of dement leaves
Left wing extreme teen scene feed for fuckary
This is handshake to those who hate big business as much as me
Mot saying "go project mayhem" - so what the fuck you mean?
New game, 10 point for every disabled SUV
First one to a million wins
And rappers trucks are worth 20

[Tame One]
I pack bowls in a black hole, vaccum the rooms oxygen
Rocked again, showing my ass like I was modelin
Striking a pose til my Vicodins
Slow me down until a slight crawl
The leak-leak in my freezer turn to ice balls
Multi-drugial, bug a few dealers
The Weathermen-W serves like Pittsburgh Stealers
I in curtains, I'm merking any receiver with the signal
Thinking they open, pass to the left like dutchy smoking
TA-ME, lace up the PCP
but Mr. kennylz we don't mean long branch with the LB
We're Leak Brothers seperated from birth
Reunited for a verse
Blackin out like we're the background in the universe
My mental stuck like a fucked up CD
If you wanna get high, fuck it, come and smoke dust with me
don't be scurred, all of my dutches don't be herb
When I'm communicating my statements don't be words
