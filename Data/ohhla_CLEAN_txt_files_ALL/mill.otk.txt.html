[Dre]
Me and everything around me, is unstable like Chernobyl
Ready to go at any moment, jumpin like a pogo stick
Life never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience
Expect the worse but now I'm pacin, back and forth
Inside I'm melting like water on wicked witches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clinches but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem to long
I fall asleep before the endin, don't even get to say Amen
I hope He understand I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, so I say forget it
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like Riddick...Bowe
I've been fighting this since them fetus days
I count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase
It's just a phase, it's gon all pass, but that gets old too
I'm weakening like a deacon doin dirt
What am I supposed to do?

Chorus: Dre

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh (Planets and stars)
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh (Earth, Jupiter, Mars)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh (Hoes, clothes, cars)
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh (It's who you are)

[Big Boi]
See, from bedknobs to broomsticks, we lookin to start some new shit
I'm writin this rhyme in faith, so when you hear it, hope you true it
My nigga, you do it like swooshes, the lyrical cleanse and new zits
Wipin away your germs and fillin your cranium with juices
See Mo goes on, my slick flow flows on
Straight from west Savannah, Georgia, but the S.W.A.T.S. is my home
Never go wrong cuz the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad
Mosquito, now we goes, I'm proud of you peoples
For sellin your crack in sacks, I'm glad I'm white not Black
Shit, on the real, that's how them whiteys really act
When your back was turned, them slackers learned and now we fallin apart
You lookin me in my eye, but you ain't feelin me in your heart
Yes, yes Lord, give me the power within the final hour
These niggaz, they leavin me stranded like Rapunzel in the tower
Now or never, let's stick together and overcome
But they don't feel like marchin, cuz they shoes is overrun
Ain't that a bitch

Chorus

Planets and stars
Earth, Jupiter, Mars
Hoes, clothes, cars
It's who you are

Chorus

Planets and stars
Earth, Jupiter, Mars
Hoes, clothes, cars
It's who you are</pre>
