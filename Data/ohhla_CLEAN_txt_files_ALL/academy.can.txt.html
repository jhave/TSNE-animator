Dear Academy, take note!
I should get, the Oscar vote
If I don't, I'll bite your throat!
Signing off now, quote unquote

[Canibus]
Yo, nominated for being underrated; we made a name for ourselves
but I guess Common was the only one that made it
I clapped when he won his award
Him and Black Eyed Peas and them, we was on the same tour
And DMX too, you my dawg for life (rrrrrrrrr)
I feel for you, I wanna see you get yours tonight
Mos Def you on the screen now, followin your dreams now
Me you and Spike Lee used to sit and freestyle
I said two words, they both got bleeped out
If you ever need me again, just reach out
I got poseurs that belong on posters
Pour out all my emotions and double what the gross is
Everybody in the box office know the flow sick
I wanna thank Nottz, the producer that chose 'Bis
Motherfuckers!

[acceptance speech]
I wanna thank my mother, I wanna thank my brother
For makin the film, cause all the support was very important
From the beginning I got fans and, y'know cult members
That never let me down from day one - I'm just inebriated to be here
I wanna thank you all

[Canibus]
Yo, I don't wanna bite nobody's throat, I just want smoke
Yo pass the 'dro nigga; yo, I can't believe
I'm sittin with Don Cheadle, Denzel and Russell Crowe man
Dave Chappelle yo I really liked your show man
Ice Cube, yo he in the next room man
D12, me and them struck a pose man! {shhh, shhh be quiet}
With Slim Shady, yo this must be a omen! {shhhhhhhh shut up}
I think I'm 'bout to go platinum, I'M EXPLODIN! {shhh you're too loud}
I'm a fool man, what I'm 'sposed to do man
Red &amp; Meth, "How High Part II" man
Bokeem Woodbine bump me in his hood all the time
I wanna say peace, I'm a fan of yours brah
I seen Hov' on a hundred foot boat
At the Cannes Film Festival with Sophie and Cope'
And Scarlett Johansson, she was with her man friend
"Lost in Translation," number one smash hit
(And now, introducing, Can-I-BUSSSSSS!)
Yo, I'm in the game now, I ran "8 Miles"
I ain't the same old nigga with the same style
The lifestyle of Jermaine is my brainchild
Jermaine's really like the black John Wayne (WOW)
Or James Caan, negotiatin some rhymes for the Don
I ain't seen my niggaz in so long (so long)
We did a short film, "4,3,2,1"
It was hot back then when it was new, but
I did this other film, "Gone Til November"
Me and Wyclef was in the trenches together
I did a big movie with him, he put me on soundtracks
Back then, I didn't understand the music business
Every agent found it hard to find me
In the backwoods of Holly, rehearsin my hobby
Shoutout to R.O.C. and State Property
I was inside the beast, shoutout to DMP, peace

[shoutouts]
Killa Khan, Sha, Black &amp; Deco, my nigga Star
Nottz, what?  Yeah
Throw shots, spread out your face like Botox
Nigga what?</pre>
