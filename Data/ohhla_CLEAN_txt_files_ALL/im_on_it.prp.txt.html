I be on it all night, man I be on it (day day)

[Verse 1: Rock-D]
Time an' time again I gotta turn back round an' tell dese hoes
Dat I'm the H-N-I-C, bitch dats just the way it goes
I be on dat shit dat have you on it I don't want no mo
At dis time I'll need all my freak hoes to get down on the flo'
If you came to rep yo set break dat nigga I let 'em kno'
If it's jail I get for stompin' hatas to sleep, fuck it I go
Freak I'll be off in yo sheets straight geeked swervin' down yo street
In a stolen Bonneville wit 23's on the feet
Collection while he do brown, back in town to do re-bag
Give me face, I love the sound
Slap the taste they hit the ground
Back in the A
Hooked up, clicked up wit sum people dat don't play
On dat Kryptonite stay
So high we might fly awwwaaayyy

[Chorus]
[Rock-D]
I be on dat Kryptonite
Straight up on dat Kryptonite
I be on dat, straight up on dat
I be on dat Kryptonite

I be on dat Kryptonite
Straight up on dat Kryptonite
I be on dat, straight up on dat
I be on dat Kryptonite

[Verse 2: Blackowned C-Bone]
Time an' time again I gotta tell dese niggaz an' dese hoes
I'm from College Park where we move dat weed an' we slag dat blow
Get dope on a daily basis
Get high make dem ugly faces
Pull the dro' an' I'm on probation
My blunts I don't be lacin'
I'm on Kryptonite
Come to my crib tonight
Let me beat dat puss all night
Run tell yo buddies I fucked you right
Tell 'em bout all the plaques on the wall
Tell 'em how you licked my balls
Tell 'em how Konkrete run the streets
Big Boi, he put us on

[Bridge: Killer Mike]
Chevy ridas, slangin' powders, Simpson Rd., Dixie Hills
Diamond pressed against dat wood, candy paint, spinnin' wheels
Grind Time rap game, remember bitches Killer Kill
Purple Ribbon rollin' o's, an' we all be on dat Kryp

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Time an' time again I turn back round an' tell C-Bone
Grab kurl on out my book bag, I smell dro' all on you homes
Suppose the po-po get whiff of the spliff dat you just smoke, dem folk gon trip
Probably will cause canines, move it the side of the road lets take a sniff (arff)
Shit, the only thing we ridin' dirty is GBK cd, Tackleberry
So may we be on our Mary way
Cuz you just ain't gon find no yah
Play, I got a tough team of attorneys
Make a judge lean like he sippin syrupy
They play dur-ty, he cain't touch me
Verdict be not guilty, search me

[Bridge: Killer Mike]

[Chorus: 2x]

[Big Boi]
