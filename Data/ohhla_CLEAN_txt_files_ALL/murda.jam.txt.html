[Verse 2: Scarface] + (T.O.K.)
Gunshots pop, dead man drop
Niggaz pull the pistols out the feds sayin stop
(Ah! Ah! Ah!) But dude we don't stop this cause G's don't quit
Quick to kill a motherfucker cause these don't click
(Ah! Ah! Ah!) O.G.'s so slick, they down with the trigger click
Squeeze on shit, we found where them niggaz stay
Police so sick, there's nothin they can do about
Me (?) get in now movin out
(Ah! Ah! Ah!) Tired of bein broke here, sick of feelin fucked up
Wait until the smoke clear, cause I'm a hustler
 (Ah! Ah! Ah!) Hustle from dusk till dawn, until the hustle gone
I put the muscle on, then the muzzle on
(Flexx: Murda!!!) I gotta get it dog, cause I'm a killer dude

Nothin personal y'all, that's just the way it's played

[Verse 3: Craigy T]
Sentiments attached to di glock yah

Drop flat pon spot dat nah get up yah
Gun academics must haffi learn dat
Graduate from di University of Hard Knocks

Anyway yuh tech it equal twenty gunshot

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Flexx]
We see fassies everywhere we go
Envious niggaz tryin to stop our flow
But they never gonna stop us now

They could a never never flop we show
Mek dem know seh we good to go
And if dem diss dem get overthrow
End upon six feet below, oh!

[Chorus]
