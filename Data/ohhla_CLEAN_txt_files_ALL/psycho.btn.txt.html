"Get on down" (repeat 4X cut and scratched)

I wanna fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
Fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
I wanna fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
Fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!

Verse One: Psycho Les, JuJu

Knock knock, who is it?  What my moms is the wizard
I'm about to land like an avalanche or a blizzard
So open up, let me in, then
check out the ill motherfuckin Les swing
Wickedy wicked, your girl's tit I lick it
and shwin-g it, like my man Wilson Pickett
I kick it, the Spanish Psycho's a lunatic
Rip a show, get the dough, and stick the hoe with my super *dick*
It's a AHH nut, then I be ghost
You got ta be clean everything not gross
I bust a ill style that your ears are not used to
Beatnuts make tracks for the crowd to get loose to
So honies in the house if you're hot rip your blouse off
My brothers if you're thirsty, crack the forty ounce
Beats I smack em out the stadium I never bunted
I rock all night, you got a light, let's get blunted
So light up, and pass it, so I can puff
You can't get enough of the rugged and rough
Anti-pop I ain't singin like a klutz
The world's (world's) famous (famous) Beat (beat) Nuts!

Well it's the junkyard nigga with the funk flow screamin
Hardcore, crazy bad breath like a demon
Retarded from birth see I ain't got no class
I used to fart in church and tell the preacher kiss my ass
Freakin mad styles catchin Caesars yo
It's the Psycho Dwarf killer with a stezo bro
Ugly like shit but sized crooked
Any piece of ass I ever got is cause I took it
Yo I'm invisible, niggaz can't see me kid
I did a short bid and came out cock diezel kid
Junkyard JuJu so you know
Strap a metal jacket every fuckin place I go
So play Dionne Warwick's song and Walk On By
Or maybe stick around for a Columbian Necktie
Whatever the fuck you do, just get out the place
I got some shit to blow, that's my right off in your face

I wanna fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
Fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
I wanna fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
Fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
I wanna fuck!

(Hey bro, what's happenin?  Got that good cheeba cheeba?)
"Get on down"

Verse Two: Psycho Les

Ah-ah-ah, I just ripped, out the dirt from my coffin
Flippin through loops like a lunatic dolphin
I'm back, reincarnated
Psycho Les runnin through the graveyard intoxicated
Thuggin, titty huggin graf art muggin
Keep ya where your worst nightmare snuck in
yeah!  Ya think I'm buggin here's my Glock 10
I have you singin like New Edit-it-edis-distion
Punk, play and get yo, smoked
I put two caps and I laughed up then joke around
I gets down, like Kool and
the Gang my slang got your girlfriend droolin
Yo I flip, and, land in the split
Then pop, man, bust your whole shit
Like a Shaolin Monk I kicks the grand funk
Drunk and I'm still fat out the trunk

I wanna fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
Fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
I wanna fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
Fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
I wanna fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
Fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
I wanna fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
Fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!

Yeah, your mother!
