[Chorus] - 2X
Heard what you said about me
Say it to me now
Heard what you said about me
Say it to me now

[Juvenile]
It's someone in particular got you sayin' what you sayin'
Usin' my name in vain, hard for you to stay in your lane
That nigga fought for you then manipulated your mind
And kept you out of the way so you would stay in the blind
But then you woke up, and realized he was takin' your shine
And you're mad at the whole world and they don't owe you a dime
Some of these niggaz don't be gangstas when they 'sposed to be gangstas
You know he owe you money and you're scared of him, ain't ya?
You can never point the finger at me, playa you stayed when I left
I couldn't call you when my bills wasn't paid
Wasn't dependin' on nigga to send me shit my way
Wasn't really concerned about what a bitch might say
You coulda came and testified for my trial
But you had more love for Slim and Baby than you had for 'Nile
I didn't hate, I just moved on
Now that I'm doin' good I'm hearin' me on your new song and Juve wrong?

[Chorus] - 2X
Heard what you said about me
Say it to me now
Heard what you said about me
Say it to me now

[Juvenile]
He ain't rappin', he ain't smart, he ain't gon' never be rich
He gon' be just like (?), he ain't accountin' for shit
Ridin' around in the six, mamma still live in the bricks
Across the hall from where somebody's always cookin' a fix
Where you in trouble if the police ever knock on your door
We from the ghetto so they find choppers and glocks on the floor
I done had all type of shit thrown at me, learned from this and that G
After all that I done been through, why is this bitch so happy?
I'm alive and well, a true talent indeed
I'm God's gift to the earth, would be a shame if I leave
And I seriously don't be fuckin' with niggaz with greed
And that goes for all you outsiders and family trees
I can see the specks runnin' they necks, he ain't all that
I don't even hear him to record that, I'm doin' me
We independent, ain't no middle man
Either get the business right or get the business in your brain
Play your hand

[Chorus] - 2X
Heard what you said about me
Say it to me now
Heard what you said about me
Say it to me now

Haters steady hear your name, runnin' they mouth
But really don't know a damn thing 'bout the game
And I'ma only tell you one time, I'm a millionaire
So that shit you niggaz talkin', I ain't gon' entertain

"Forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil..."

[Juvenile]
Father, I ain't gon' let 'em get to me, they know my history
(It really ain't you they hatin', 'cause of they miseries
Fulfill your purpose, you was put here for a reason
Cherish your life for every moment you breathin')
But they sayin' that I betrayed 'em
(No man can judge you)
But they askin' if I could save 'em
(You must first save yourself)
I'm the subject of conversation
(Worry about no one)
I'm knowin' that I could take 'em
(Have faith in me)

[Chorus] - 2X
Heard what you said about me
Say it to me now
Heard what you said about me
Say it to me now

Haters can't stand to hear your name, runnin' they mouth
But don't know a damn thing 'bout the game
And I'ma only tell you one time, I'm a millionaire
So that shit you niggaz talkin', I ain't gon' entertain</pre>
