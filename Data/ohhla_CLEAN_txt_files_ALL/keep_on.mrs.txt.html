[Sample from Punch Drunk Love]
"I have so much strength in me you have no idea
I have a love in my life
It makes me stronger than you can possibly imagine

[Chorus] [x4]
Keep on lovin' me
People are afraid of me but act like they love me

[Verse One] [MURS]
Now I never was liked
Until I buzzed mics
No cool points and no love life
Girls used to hug me but never would fuck me
But now I'm gettin' pussy worldwide 
[Napoleon Dynamite]: Lucky!
I didn't wear rugbys or hang where the thugs be
They used to call me ugly
It kinda used to bug me
Talk a lot of shit, but never would they touch me
A lot more than books in that backpack, trust me
Knew the ledge and never let them budge me
Various verdicts but they never could judge me
Some used to cuz me some used to blood me
Wanna be gangsters like Scarface and Bugsy
I just, might just, but never would slug me
I see 'em in the mall, now they never mean mug me
Cause they friends wanna dub me and magazines pub' me
Fools is a afraid of me but act like they love me

[Chorus] [x8]
Keep on lovin' me
People are afraid of me but act like they love me

[Verse Two] [Isaiah]
Keep on talkin' shit, growl and spit
No matter how loud you get, over the crowd's cheer I can't hear you
I don't mind an evil eye, I'm nowhere near you
I'd probably squint too if I had your view
Ouuu

[MURS]
Be on the lookout for two individuals
Dirty heat spitters with the rubbed off serial
Cannibals, animals
Foamin' at the mandible
We do what we wish
Only marks read the manual

[Isaiah]
If these rappers could flow tighter they could be my ghostwriters 
They try their hardest to portray life that I live every day
Each phrase sweet as sundays 
Pray to Yahweh on Sunday
Do we save 'em a grave made when Isaiah gets hungry?

[MURS]
I'm no joke
I'm no contest
The real deal
I'm no bomb threat
T-N-T, dynamite, napalm explosive
Two of the best but you already know this

[Chorus] [x8]
Keep on lovin' me
People are afraid of me but act like they love me</pre>
