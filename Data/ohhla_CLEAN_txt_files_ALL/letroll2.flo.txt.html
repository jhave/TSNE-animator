Song:   Let it Roll, Part 2
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Love is nice when it's understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin' why I love you so
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll

It's like Woodstock city, brand new Dylan
Bob to the music, sucker than a [?]
My heart beat acoustic, moves like Hendrix
Walk through a fire, then I flame and kiss it
Go hard in my Lambo, strikes and a blizzard
2 million in the frame, gotta roll with the vision
Vision of a good time, all I wanna know
When the party gon' stop, let the good times roll
Come on let's go, you got another minute
Get the party on the roll, ain't nothing like the feeling
When you're winning in your soul
The wheel keep spinning, only got one road
Stop, stop the show, and stop, stop the flow
The world ain't ready cause I rock the globe
So act like you know, act like you know
Act like you know, just what to do
When the good times roll

Love is nice when it's understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin' why I love you so
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
(Come on baby, let the good times roll)

[Lil Wayne]
Hey, Flo I got you!
Yeah yeah!
Take your, take your clothes off
Ride that, I drove off
Highway to heaven I'll burn the bridge
Red bandana, blood, sweat and tears
Yeah, it's Tunechi, Tunechi
With a capital crucifix, hahaha!
Baby let the good times roll like my weed
Sticks on my skateboard, and up my sleeves
YMCMB Truk everything else
So many whips, my garage got whelps
Now put your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And my throne is an electric chair
Yeah!

And let's go all night, all night
Wake up the club and let's go all out, all out
More drinks for us, toast to the good times
May they last forever, we're young, to the good times
Raise your glass, let's all have some fun

Come on baby, let the good times roll...</pre>
