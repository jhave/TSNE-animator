Song:   Behind the Music
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
No you don't stand a chance
For a second in my world
The same old song, it won't last long
If you can't stand behind the music
All the fame, all the girls
And all the money in this world
They don't mean shit, better admit
If you can't stand behind the music

So stand up, show 'em how we do it
Won't back down until I see your, hands up
Tell 'em what the truth is
Stand behind the music

[Verse 1]
You gotta get behind
Cross your heart, hope to die
Splash of hype, dash of pretty
That don't mean I'll buy
Okay alright already
They getting money
All the frauds, all the phonies
All the fakes, slow down
It's a fast paced world, breathe, breathe
Look my face in the mirror
Say, "Who the heck am I? "â¨Look me in the eye
Is this conviction or addiction or a waste of time?
Just name a genre, yeah I've tried it
Been doin' this from 15 to life, yeah
I need a break already, I gotta find it
And for the first time in my life, I'm doing my schtick
I, I, I, I, I wanna stand in this pop star frenzy
Girls getting praise, look at Nikki look at Katy
Chew it up, make my teeth rot
You think I'm talkin' to ya? I'm probably not (not)

[Chorus]
No you don't stand a chance
For a second in my world
The same old song, it won't last long
If you can't stand behind the music
All the fame, all the girls
And all the money in this world
They don't mean shit, better admit
If you can't stand behind the music

[Verse 2]
Rewind, when I was a little younger
Lookin' for a label and a little clean danger
LA had a taste for a new adventure
We opened every 'do not enter
Yeah I was tryin' hard to be somebody
Be the cool kid at the party
Lookin' at me laddy daddy, hottie hottie, hot tamale
Stranger sizing up my bodyâ¨Told me I could be somebody
Wait, someone stopped me
Went home and I called my mommy
Oh no, I'm not that girl
I still wanna be the leader of the f-f-free world
I'm a big dreamer, I'm a believer
Just try to tell me no, I'm a go full steam ahead
No, can't slow me down
Gonna run this town from the inside out
Block by block from the bottom to the top
I know just who I am
And I know just who I'm not

[Chorus]
No you don't stand a chance
For a second in my world
The same old song, it won't last long
If you can't stand behind the music
All the fame, all the girls
And all the money in this world
They don't mean shit, better admit
If you can't stand behind the music

So stand up, show em how we do it
Won't back down until I see your hands up
Tell 'em what the truth is
Stand behind the music

Yeah, stand up, come on let me see you
Front row up to the nose bleeders
Hands up, if you really need it
Stand behind the music

No you don't stand a chance
For a second in my world
The same old song, it won't last long
If you can't stand behind the music</pre>
