[Chorus]
[Repeat 3x]
Oye Loca! Ven pa'ca! Come here!

What!
Muevelo, muevelo sin parar!
Let's Go! Como!

Si tu quiere' que te coma toda
Si tu quiere' que te coma toda
Si tu quiere' que te coma toda
Abre las pierna', y dale Toma!
I'ma make that thang bounce!
I'ma make that thang shake!
I'ma make that thang clap!
I'ma make that thang break!

Every other city we go
We always pull a couple of pretty hoes
Send 'em back to the room and get it on!
Once we're done, get your clothes
Get going! Dale!
Let me see you get freaky baby!
Let me see you get nasty mami!
Let me see you act like an animal
Straight out the cage baby, Dale!
What I do is unheard of
With these women I'm O.J
I get away with murder!
I'ma hit 'till it's out of order
If it wasn't for R. Kelly
I'll record her!
Now step to the right!
Now step to the left!
Now hold on one second
Baby let me catch my breath
Hah, Hah, let's go!
Hah, Hah, let's go!
Hah, Hah, let's go!
Hah, Hah, ah Break It Down!
[Chorus]

Mami I know how you like it
Just let loose!
Go ahead and relax!
Let me play with your pretty kitty
Your pretty titties
And let me play with your ass!
I'm the Chico that'll take you to ecstasy!
What you waiting for?
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
When we finish tonight
I'll guarantee that you'll be calling me back
For some more, more, more!
And at the same time
I want you to teach me a little something
Just blow my mind!
You know what I mean
The one below the waist line!
You know me
Baby I'm freaky! Freaky?
Baby I'm freaky! Freaky?
Baby I'm freaky! Freaky?
Baby I'm freaky! Freaky?
Baby I'm freaky!

[Chorus]

It's getting kinda hot in this muthafucka tonight ladies!
That means it's time for ya'll to get all the way wild and loose!
I don't care if you got a man, you single, whatever!
It's time, it's time, it's time, let's go!

[Repeat 2x]
Quitate la ropa, Quitate la ropa!
Quitate la ropa, si estas caliente
Quitate la ropa!</pre>
