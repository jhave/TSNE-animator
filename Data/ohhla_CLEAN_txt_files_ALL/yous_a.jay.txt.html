UH, uh, one shot to your dome pow!
Yeah, can ya stand it?
This for your boy Snoop Doggy Doggy Doggy DoggDoggy Dogg
Can ya stand it?
Lyrocks
Yeah

It's that crip nigga, quick hit em with my dick
Spit with a big shit, kick a nigga
Get wit a nigga quick shit
Bitch, now can you picture me jokin?
I bang 47th street, bitch I keep it loccin
And all around the world, I leave my enemies broken
Like toot, toot, toot, you hear their families hopin
With tooooot, death is all I got to give
I said my name is One Shot Kill not One Shot Live
And all ya muthafuckas got to go
?? haven't got the chance to flow
Hit a muthafucka with a gangsta flow
?? prank to though
Have you ever shot a nigga befo'? No!
Have you ever killed a nigga befo'? No!
And I'ma take yo lil ass to the movies to ??  Part 4
I flip four cases of noodles on moral
And nobody had to give me shit when I was in Paso
G might kick a nigga in, even though he was from the Brimms
Now I'm rolling with triple gold rims, eatin shit and Eminems/M&amp;Ms

[Hook](2x)
You's a muthafuckin character I buried ya
Knew you was scared, nigga scary us
They got my area
Fashion gangbangas with the part but can't play the role
When it's all said and done I'ma be left with these streets in my soul

[Jayo Felony]
Which one of ya'll tricks wanna test this?
Young, dumb and I'm restless
You hide from me when you throw parties and never make ya guest list
You's a character you fake gangbangin clown
And the homies and cuz's would tear this muthafucka down, RIGHT NOW!
Now, my khakis always fit me
Don't want no funk, you scared to squabble with me
I'm the hardest on dry land and even you see that
Catch him with 11 thou on the +Baby Boy+ movie set
I approached like "We need to holla" and he tucked his tail
Cus this bitch lanky nigga knew he can't fuck with Fel
Ya see even you know what type a nigga you was facin
Tryin to leave and hurry up and get to the next location
Tryin to jump me but I knew to grab his cold ass nigga
A 40s cuz? I'ma about to meatball that nigga
Beg me to sign to ya label, nigga but keep tryin though
Had his perm fucked leanin to the side like Lionel

Now he's mad security cus I put hands on his soft dude
No I got scrathes on my neck from niggas pullin me off you
I'm quick to kick up dust, bustin and cussin like a sailor
Beat you out your Chuck Taylors, bring your bitch ass up out the trailer
I'm a thoroughbred born to lock up, I don't care none
I'm callin you all kinds a bitches while screamin that you's a fair one
Sorry ass got his ?? screamin all that crip shit
Punk scary ass police done went 'n mess my nigga Biskit
Tryin to act like you don't know where I'm ridin, nigga stop
Goin the Last Meal this muthafucka stealin Crip Hop
Bitin ass nigga, knowin he about to come up short
The street and all made this shit up and 40 basketball court
Be a man bitch don't snitch or on sight you'll get dumped
And got beef tucked all over the hump ya fuckin punk
You can't fuck with this flow I keep it steady mayn
And tell that bitch nigga Kokane he Eddie Cane
I still got it
